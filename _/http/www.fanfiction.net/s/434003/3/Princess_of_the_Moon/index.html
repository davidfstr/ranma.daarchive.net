</div>**********<br/>Princess of the Moon<br/>Chapter 02<br/>By C. Rose<br/>(c)2001<p>**********<p>For the first time in months, Ranma had come across a guy who was willing<br/>to fight her tooth and nail, the fact that he wanted to kill her didn't<br/>matter in the least. It just meant that they would be fighting that much<br/>harder, Jedite was this evil bad guy with magical abilities and a lot of raw<br/>power at his disposal. Ranma knew she could beat him, she just wanted to see<br/>what he had to offer. She had already taken him down once and that had been<br/>too easy.<p>Ranma ignored the fact that he had already gotten in good blow and sliced<br/>her leg open somehow, it was just a flesh wound and nothing to worry about.<br/>The pool of blood at her feet meant nothing to her as she limped to the<br/>side, circling the blonde idiot. "What's the matter, that all you got?"<p>"What is your name girl?" Jedite growled.<p>"You may call me Ranko, Master of the School of Anything Goes Martial<br/>Arts."<p>"I am Jedite, General of Queen Beryl's army's and soon to be King of<br/>Earth."<p>"Well J-chan, you have to actually defeat me first and your track record<br/>isn't so hot."<p>Jedite screamed and rushed forward, throwing a punch that Ranma barely<br/>ducked. She blinked a few times and reevaluated Jedite's skill, he may be<br/>dependent on his magic, but he has learned to use it effectively. His speed<br/>is nearly equal to her own now, but Ranma just dodged and weaved. Second<br/>rule her idiot father had taught her, never show your true strength even in<br/>a major battle. Ranma's leg came up and hit Jedite right in the chin and<br/>sent him flying back, she didn't give him time to get very far though as she<br/>spun around kicked him in the side and booted him into a nearby building.<p>He impacted with a cry of pain, face first, and slid down to the ground<br/>moaning. Jedite's mind, though filled with pain was confused, this girl was<br/>breaking through his magical defenses as if they didn't exist. Even Sailor<br/>Moon had been helpless before his force fields and power blasts, but this<br/>Ranko was seemed to know something he didn't. Jedite crawled back to his<br/>feet and decided that this girl was going to be dead by the time he was done<br/>with there. "Alright, you've pushed me to far girl."<p>"Ohh, I'm shaking in my sneakers here." Ranma taunted.<p>Jedite held out his hand and a sword and shield appeared, a blazing aura of<br/>power formed around him and his uniform shifted to a more stately style with<br/>a cape that billowed with the aura he was producing. The sword glinted in<br/>the sunlight and burst into black fire. "Die bitch!" He growled out, his<br/>eyes blazing with fury.<p>Ranma crouched down and burst into a blazing blue aura and studied her<br/>opponent, he kept surprising her. She could feel his power now, but is<br/>wasn't the evil he had been producing before, but a pure kind of power that<br/>the Scouts used. Where in the world had he learned this from, she thought.<br/>Growling deep in her throat, Ranma's aura turns red and flares out a couple<br/>of feet even as she launches forward. Jedite does the same and leads in with<br/>the sword, leaving black and silver after images as it moves. Side stepping<br/>the sword, Ranma kicks Jedite several times, but his armor is tougher than<br/>it looks and isn't damaged.<p>The sword blurs in a dizzying pattern of death as Ranma weaves in and out<br/>of the man's defenses, but she is distracted and gets hit in the face with<br/>the shield sending her stepping back. Right in the path of Jedite's sword as<br/>it slices her upper arm open, making her gasp in pain. Then it spreads<br/>quickly and fills her body, Ranma staggers back and falls to her knees as<br/>her head flares as if it is about to explode. She screams in pain and falls<br/>over clutching her head, tears of pain dripping off her cheeks.<p>"This is one of the famous Pain Blades we used to defeat the Moon Kingdom<br/>originally, they haven't seen the light of day in centuries, but it looks<br/>like their power is still very effective, eh, bitch? Can't talk, I'm not<br/>surprised, these things have brought the most powerful of fighters to their<br/>knees, right where you are."<p>"Ahhh..." Ranma said.<p>"Now what should I do with you? You are going to die, but how shall I do<br/>it, a limb at at time, or months of endless torture...Bwhahahahahahahaha!"<p>Through her haze of pain, Ranma had one thought, this man is an absolute<br/>idiot! He had me down and stands there to gloat? Ranma groans and reaches<br/>for her full strength and her aura flares out again, this time it is edged<br/>in a blue band of confidence and she slowly raises to her feet, her crescent<br/>moon flaring brightly and making her aura even bigger. The pain is more<br/>than she has ever had to endure, but the flare of her aura seems to bleed<br/>the dark attack off and within seconds it is down to tolerable levels.<br/>Jedite is still laughing as she moves to uppercut him with the force of<br/>semi, lifting him into the air and dropping him like a sack of potatoes. The<br/>sword drops and shatters as it hits the ground, it soon vanishes like those<br/>monsters he was summoning.<p>"A crescent moon..." Jedite gasps and goes pale, trying to crawl away.<p>Ranma continues her attack by kicking him into the air and using it as a<br/>free floating punching bag, punching and kicking the idiot until his entire<br/>body is black and blue, his eyes are rolled back in unconsciousness, and she<br/>is sure of victory. She is about to put him down for the final time when<br/>Jedite's body vanishes out of her hand in a swirl of cherry blossoms.<p>Ranma's eyes narrow and she relaxes, looking around for where Jedite had<br/>gone. Something inside her is telling her that he was teleported away, but<br/>what that thing is, she has no idea. Then she senses something and her head<br/>snaps around to look at a nearby roof top and spots a tall green haired<br/>Sailor Scout holding a weird looking staff. She jumps down and walks over,<br/>calmly assessing the situation and smiling at Ranma. She pulls a mirror from<br/>behind her back and holds it up for Ranma to see the bright silver crescent<br/>moon glowing on her forehead.<p>"What is that?"<p>"That is the mark of the Royal Family of the Moon, Ranma, only those of<br/>that family can have that mark and your display of power just now proved<br/>that you are a member of that family. That marks you as a princess of the<br/>moon, you have royal blood in you Ranma and it is beginning to adapt to the<br/>power that is within you, making you stronger in every way."<p>"I am not a Princess lady, I am a man, I was born a man and will always be<br/>one."<p>"Do you think I didn't look at your past Ranma Saotome, I am the Guardian<br/>of Time, I can watch anything that has ever happened or will be. You were<br/>given this form for a reason, you don't have to act like a Princess as you<br/>understand them Ranma. NO matter how you act or dress, you are a Princes of<br/>the Moon Kingdom. You make what kind of Princess you will become, not what<br/>others think you should act like. The Scouts need your help with Jedite and<br/>the others that will eventually follow him in the years to come. Please<br/>Ranma, if you don't help, eventually the Scouts will be killed and the world<br/>will suffer under the heel of whoever it was that killed them. They are all<br/>that stands between peace and the destruction that the elements of evil that<br/>will try time and again to take this world."<p>"Is that supposed to sway me, to make me take up a fight that is none of my<br/>business?" Ranma snapped. "What if I do help, then what, do I dress up in<br/>these stupid costumes and let all the perverts in the nation look up my<br/>skirt all in the name of love and peace?"<p>"There is a magical field around those that wear this uniform Ranma, you<br/>could meet your father dressed like this and he wouldn't recognize you."<p>"Yeah, he would be to busy trying to look up my skirt or chasing me<br/>around for a quick feel." Ranma grumbled.<p>Pluto sighed and held up a Sailor Scout Pen with the symbol of the sun on<br/>it. "This is one of the only Sailor Scouts that was destined to never appear<br/>Ranma, Sailor Sol or Sun. When a girl takes up one of these pens and<br/>transforms into their Sailor Identity, the transformation multiplies their<br/>best assets, your strength would be incredible, as would your speed, and<br/>your Ki attacks would be strong enough to level entire city blocks if you<br/>used all the power available. Just imagine the amount of good you could do<br/>with that at your disposal."<p>"A powerful toy is not enough to make me just drop my beliefs you know."<p>Pluto stepped back and bowed and opened a large door that hadn't been there<br/>seconds before. "Then look upon the Gate of Time and see the possible<br/>futures that may come to be if you don't help us Ranma."<p>The door opened to show a barren land scrape devoid of even plant life, the<br/>sky was almost pitch black, the light coming from a tiny pin prick of<br/>something high in the atmosphere. Pluto pointed to it. "That is what will<br/>happen if the Silence is brought to pass just a few years form now." The<br/>scene shifted again and showed Jedite and another man with long white hair<br/>pulling girls out of a line up of half naked girls, the surroundings looked<br/>like a labor camp of some kind. "This is a year form now, just a few short<br/>months before the Silence takes place, notice the girl being held by Jedite,<br/>that is someone you know, yes?"<p>"...Shampoo?"<p>"Her and the village are vaporized in one shot when they refuse to bow down<br/>to Queen Beryl's rule, only the girl's between fifteen and twenty are<br/>allowed to live and that is as you see them."<p>"You said these are only possible futures?"<p>"Yes, there are hundreds of possibilities to choose from, some like this,<br/>others where they were more lucky. It all depends on choices Ranma, will you<br/>accept this pen?"<p>"I don't know..."<p>"I can offer one more incentive Ranma, when you take up the mantel of<br/>Sailor Sol it will make you whole again. That means that your fear of cats<br/>will vanish and you will be able to learn how to control the true Neko-ken."<p>"I-I...sigh, alright I accept."<p>"Here, take it and say what is already in your heart."<p>"Huh, I don't know about this..." Ranma hesitated.<p>"You accepted Ranma, that was a promise to help the others wasn't it?"<br/>Pluto said.<p>Ranma reached out and took the pen from Pluto, he had a strange feeling<br/>about this, and they both gasped as it turned into light fragments and<br/>formed around her arms as a pair of gold and black bracers. "W-what the<br/>hell?"<p>A surprised Pluto kept her face straight and replied. "You are the first<br/>new Scout to be born in over ten thousand years Ranma, it is adapting to you<br/>and making you a modern version of a Sailor Scout. Can you feel the power in<br/>your veins?"<p>"I can...it's..."<p>"Say the words Ranma."<p>"SOL CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"<p>This feeling of pure ecstasy filled Ranma and she moaned as she was lifted<br/>into the air, the bracers flare with a blinding light, when it recedes Ranma<br/>is clad in a fuku unlike any have ever seen before, reddish black leather<br/>body suit, a red and black skirt, a green front bow and a white back bow<br/>with the ribbons trailing nearly to the floor. She has on knee high reddish<br/>black boots, the arm bands now decorated with little crescent moons, and a<br/>tiara with a ruby in the center. This feeling was filling Ranma's soul and<br/>she shuddered a little as she nearly came right there, what ever it was she<br/>felt wonderful. Strong and fast, powerful and unstoppable enough to take on<br/>all of the demons in Jedite's arsenal. "Whoa!"<p>"See what I mean?"<p>"This may be a little much..."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"This could become addicting if I let it."<p>"That is always the same with the first transformation, it is the power<br/>adapting itself to your body. The fact that you have royal blood in you is<br/>probably what is making it so pleasurable for you, the transformation is<br/>very intense."<p>"Okay, I could get used to this." Ranma said and suppressed a moan and<br/>shuddered a little. "Hey wait a minute, it's broad daylight here, why<br/>haven't we been seen yet?"<p>"I am the Guardian of Time Ranma, I made us just about a half second ahead<br/>of normal time, so everything is stopped until I start us up again." Pluto<br/>said with a hint of arrogance.<p>"Is there anything else I need to know?" Ranma asked.<p>"As a Princess you will be receiving a cat adviser."<p>"Ca-ca-cat?"<p>"Your fears should be gone Ranma..."<p>"Almost completely, but there is this feeling left over...I don't know how<br/>to describe it."<p>"It's just reflex Ranma, you'll get over it in time. I'll send you a cat<br/>adviser as soon as I can." Pluto said, the girl didn't need to know that one<br/>had been sent for already and would be arriving inside a week. It had to<br/>come all the way from the Retreat, fairy cats were made to be such good<br/>companions too. With that thought, Pluto stepped into the gate and vanished<br/>in a swirl of fog. The course of time resumed and Ranma found herself above<br/>Tokyo bay, she screamed as she fell the twenty feet into the water, cursing<br/>green haired women all the way.<p>AT the Time Gate Pluto laughed at her water logged friend.<p>**********<p>It was midnight when the guard dozed off to sleep and he opened his eyes<br/>and looked around carefully. For the first time in months the time was ripe<br/>for him to try again, they were getting lazy in their patrols. They must<br/>have thought him beaten or cowed, but he would never give up his freedom<br/>again, not after the Master. He raised an arm covered in fur and let his<br/>mind wander deep into untouched territory to call up a skill he hadn't<br/>touched in fifteen years. At first he couldn't remember the techniques, but<br/>after days of trying he had finally recalled them. His arm snapped out and<br/>hit the guard in the back of the head, she fell to the ground with a loud<br/>clatter.<p>Snapping the bamboo door off it's string hinges, the escapee vanished from<br/>sight as it high tailed itself out of the cursed village of Amazons. Curse<br/>that ungrateful son of his and his dishonorable ways, he had worked to hard<br/>over the last few years to see his dreams destroyed like this. Genma Saotome<br/>raced along, his panda body running on it's hind legs like some well trained<br/>circus bear. Spears, arrows, darts, and a whole plethora of other objects<br/>were thrown at him as he raced along, dodging the pathetic Amazons attempts<br/>to capture him. Genma laughed, or growled in joy as he ran over a hill and<br/>vanished from sight.<p>The Amazons stopped chasing the giant cowardly panda and laughed. "Do you<br/>think letting him go was a good idea, it only took him a whole three months<br/>to finally try and escape, I was beginning to think that he was retarded or<br/>something, I only left the cage door open ever night for weeks." Said<br/>Perfume.<p>"True, and he still broke it when he escaped." Shampoo said.<p>"Do you think he will find Ranma for us?"<p>"Yes, he is the girl's father, he will find her eventually."<p>"Then let us go, the idiot doesn't even know how to cover his tracks when<br/>he runs. I'm bored already. Are you sure you have everything you need?"<p>"Oh yes." Shampoo said and pulled a large sword out of nowhere, moon light<br/>glinted off the blade, giving it an evil look. A half mile away a panda saw<br/>the girl's at the top of the hill, the sword, and the reflected light and<br/>ran for his life.<p>**********<p>-A Day in the Life of Ryoga the Wanderer-<p>Ryoga was knocking snow off his boots as he looked around the jungle he<br/>found himself in, not ten minutes ago it had been snow so bad he had been<br/>having trouble seeing. Then he had jumped over this large crack in the ice<br/>and landed in this jungle, how the snow survived here he had no idea. All he<br/>did now was that some thing was calling him, but whenever he focused on it,<br/>he remembered his most prized memory of a topless girl smiling at him.<br/>(Ryoga's memories have always been a little delusional). He was still<br/>looking for Ranma, but felt it wasn't as important as it had been two years<br/>ago. Their trail had dried up completely and he had no idea where to look<br/>now, but that girl who was haunting his dreams kept popping up.<p>She had traveled all over China studying with various masters and priests,<br/>if the rumors were true, she had learned how to user her chi. Ryoga wanted<br/>to ask out...er..challenge his mysterious beauty, but had no way to find her<br/>with his sense of direction. Then one day he had been thinking about her and<br/>felt her far away and he had run towards where he felt her, crossing<br/>jungles, cemetery's, mountains, cities, and lakes until he had become<br/>totally lost. It must have taken half an hour at least, at one point he had<br/>felt he was close, but had lost it when he tripped and fell in that lake.<br/>Some Americans had pulled him out, but since he didn't know English very<br/>well they had taken him to the nearest port. When he had stepped off the<br/>little walkway down to the docks he had turned back to thank them, but ended<br/>up tripping and getting a face full of snow.<p>Where the hell that came from he had no idea, maybe it had snowed when he<br/>wasn't paying attention. Americans always were a bit weird, maybe it was<br/>because of that weird weather. Now he was in a jungle, it looked familiar<br/>for some reason as he walked. Suddenly there was a doorway ahead of him<br/>between a couple of trees and he went through, maybe they had a phone he<br/>could borrow or decent directions. He walked out on stage and noticed that<br/>there were a lot of half naked men running around and a totally naked girl<br/>chained to a wall, she was screaming in some language he didn't know. With a<br/>shrug Ryoga batted the men of the stage into a crowd he hadn't noticed and<br/>shattered the wall the girl was chained to.<p>She wrapped her naked body around him and tried to kiss him, but he<br/>couldn't see anything with his eyes close and what he was feeling was<br/>tempting enough. He could feel the blood going to his nose while he carried<br/>her off the stage and tried to ask her for directions to Juban. Eventually<br/>he gave up and sat her down and waved goodbye, he missed the sad look on her<br/>face as she slumped down, naked, on the beach. The sign in the background<br/>said 'Welcome to the Bahamas'.<p>(Note-I just had to put this in here, it just fit for some reason...heh)<p>**********<p>Akiko was not having a good day, she had thought it was going to be such a<br/>good day too. She had woken up early, fixed herself breakfast without<br/>screwing it up and even managed to get to school on time for a change. She<br/>had spent most of the day finishing off her homework and fantasizing about<br/>some of the guys in her class, just a typical, normal day. After school she<br/>had ran home and quickly changed into her casual clothes to go and meet her<br/>friends for a lazy afternoon walk through the mall. That was when the<br/>problems began, after a couple of hours her friends had headed on home, but<br/>there were still a few things that she needed so she decided to stick around<br/>and get them on her own.<p>For some reason she had known that something was going to happen, but had<br/>ignored it, figuring she was just being silly. On the way home from the mall<br/>she had decided to take the long was and get a good look at the ocean before<br/>bed. She had been walking along the sidewalk, just along the beach that<br/>bordered the ocean, when three boys had come out of nowhere and dragged her<br/>down to a secluded part of the beach to have their fun with her. Now<br/>normally she would have been more than happy to help them out, but they had<br/>to start hitting her for no particular reason and that just pissed her off.<br/>She struggled for several minutes trying to find a decent leverage to throw<br/>the idiots off, they weren't even that good in the first place. Then the<br/>most amazing thing happened, the first of the three boys who was currently<br/>on lookout, let off a short scream and vanished.<p>The amazing thing was that none of the boys seem to notice when he<br/>vanished, but Akiko had noticed a reddish black blur just milliseconds<br/>before he vanished. She was a little board so she didn't have anything else<br/>to do, all she really wanted was for the moron above her to finish what he<br/>was doing. She struggled a little more and caught a second vanishing act at<br/>the corner of her eye, as the second of the three boys vanished, but this<br/>time the last of the three took note and jumped to his feet. Just in time<br/>to see a tall red headed woman wearing a Sailor Scout fuku appear out of<br/>thin air and kicked him across the jaw with a spinning kick that launched<br/>him back over a dozen yards to land in the water at the edge of the beach.<br/>Akiko was a little amazed that he didn't get back up, then realized that the<br/>kick must have very powerful to have thrown him that far. She shrugged and<br/>hoped he got out of the water before he caught a cold or something.<p>Akiko sat up and stretched the kinks out of her back before looking up at<br/>her savior. She had witnessed the regular Sailor Scouts on more than one<br/>occasion as they dealt with the various monsters that roamed around the area<br/>lately. None of them had looked anything like this one, there was an aura<br/>of power around her that could be felt more than a could be seen. She had<br/>long red hair that fell down her back, to well below her thighs, it had been<br/>braided tightly and tied back with a small black bow at the top of her head.<br/>The girls body suit seemed to be made out of a reddish black wet leather<br/>design that made her attractive body even more gorgeous to look at.<p>"Are you alright?" Asked Ranma as she stood above the half naked Akiko.<p>"Oh sure." Akiko said as she stood up and adjusted her clothing. "I've<br/>had this happen to me a few times in the past, so it's become somewhat<br/>boring really. I mean those guys didn't even doing anything of interest, it<br/>was boring and not really very original or stimulating." Akiko shrugged and<br/>dusted her skirt off.<p>"Um...sure..." Ranma said, she looked a little confused. "Would you like<br/>me to help you home?"<p>"No thanks." Akiko said as she went over to where the guys had piled their<br/>closed and stole their wallets. "Those guys owe me some new clothes and<br/>need to replace the groceries that they destroyed when they grabbed me."<br/>Akiko said as she stripped every last bill out of the three wallets and<br/>started to start counting it out. "Look at this, cheep bastards, this isn't<br/>enough to cover what they ripped or destroyed."<p>Ranma edged away from the strange girl and resisted the urge to sweatdrop,<br/>she waved goodbye and with a couple of large jumps was soon running across<br/>the rooftops of the Juban district. As she ran, Ranma's thoughts turned to<br/>the green haired Sailor Scout that had called herself the Guardian of Time.<br/>Because of her, Ranma knew that the next few days and possibly weeks were<br/>going to be very interesting if she survived them. Sure she had taken on<br/>Jedite and a couple of his goons and beaten him somewhat easily, but she<br/>also knew that he was an intelligent being and would adapt to her skill in<br/>any way that was needed to defeat her. As a martial artist and a student of<br/>that idiot Genma Saotome, she knew that the upcoming fights were going to be<br/>more dangerous than ever and that she couldn't afford to underestimate<br/>Jedite. No matter how bad a fighter he was, he must have done something to<br/>have earned his current place as head of the invaders troops.<p>The same could be said for her heat father, he was a thief, a glutton, a<br/>liar, and a whole slew of other questionable titles. Still the old fart was<br/>possibly one of the top 50 fighters in the entire world no matter how<br/>cowardly and stupid he was. Ranma figured that she would place Jedite in the<br/>same category as her retarded father, he would adapt and learn whatever was<br/>necessary to defeat her and accomplish his mission. Of course, she also<br/>thought she might be giving Jedite a little too much intelligence, but it<br/>was better to overestimate his skill than to underestimate it. A little<br/>while later, after running at a near sprinting pace for over an hour, Ranma<br/>reached the park that was only a few blocks away from the shrine that she<br/>was staying at. She wasn't even tired when she landed in the middle of the<br/>park and looked around, but the park was surprisingly empty. Ranma wasn't<br/>sure how to detransform, but after several minutes of thinking about it she<br/>concentrated and managed to pull all of her newfound power into her body.<p>Her uniform flared with a bright red light and then vanished within her,<br/>Ranma noticed almost instantly that if she concentrated she could feel the<br/>power boiling just below the surface of her Ki. The two powers seemed to be<br/>mixing together and working in concert with each other, and the more she<br/>concentrated the quicker they seemed to merge together. Walking over to a<br/>nearby tree, Ranma sits down and begins to meditate in the way that Cologne<br/>had taught her back when she had visited their village. The old bat had<br/>been very impressed with her level of training and skill and had inducted<br/>her as an honorary Amazon. She hadn't really wanted to go along with<br/>Cologne's idea because she didn't agree with a good number of the strange<br/>laws that they practiced. It had only been through sheer luck that she<br/>hadn't gotten into trouble with any of the Amazons before then. Shampoo had<br/>been a different matter, but she didn't want to dwell on that very much.<p>Ranma performed the mental techniques that Cologne had suggested and<br/>quickly entered a meditative trance. From there she spent the next two<br/>hours going over all of the events that had taken place in the last 24<br/>hours, she did not like what she was seeing at all. She also had the<br/>distinct impression that she had been tricked in some way, but she just<br/>couldn't put her finger on exactly how it was accomplished. Her swim back to<br/>the islands had been surprisingly boring considering how far out she had<br/>been, it reminded her of her first swim from Japan to China and he idiot's<br/>idea of training during the swim. The Saotome School of Martial Arts had<br/>several techniques that allowed them to fight while underwater, she recalled<br/>having to perform them while hovering in the water about thirty feet below<br/>the surface with the old man sitting on his raft up above and eating dinner.<br/>If that hadn't been enough, she found that he wanted her to do this several<br/>times a day in shark infested waters. Panda no Baka!<p>Cologne had taught her this one move called the Shark Fist, it was<br/>particularly interesting technique that allowed a fighter to hold her hand<br/>in such a way as to throw a punch that sent out a shark shaped blast of<br/>water at her opponent. She had been wanting to test the technique out on<br/>the old man ever since she learned it, but fighting in the water was<br/>actually a very rare occurrence so she doubted that would ever happen. As<br/>she continued to meditate another question came into her head and this one<br/>she still couldn't fully grasp.<p>What exactly was it about her transformation into a girl that made the<br/>Sailor Scouts think she was a Princess? Sure, that lady had tried to explain<br/>to her, but for all she had said it still didn't make a whole hell of a lot<br/>of sense. There was just no way that she could be a Princess since she had<br/>been born as a man and raised as one. Every day of her life her father had<br/>beat into her head that the girls were weak and useless. That opinion had<br/>been altered drastically over last few months, but certain ways of thinking<br/>were almost instinctual for her and getting around the fact that she had<br/>once been a man was simply impossible for her to forget.<p>Ranma stood and stretched, even after two hours of meditating she still<br/>hadn't seen a single soul within the park. It was a little strange even to<br/>her, but figured that since she couldn't hear people screaming in terror or<br/>sense any kind of dark presence nearby with her new powers, it must have been<br/>something else. The walk out of the park and down the street to the shrine<br/>stairs took her about ten minutes and another three to run up the stairs at<br/>full speed and taking them three the time. She stopped at the top and took<br/>a few minutes to relax before hitting inside, but stopped with her foot just<br/>inside the door when her danger sense when off and alerted her to a presence<br/>nearby that was watching her very intently.<p>"Who's out there?" Ranma asked loudly.<p>"I was wondering when you would notice me." Said a distinctly female<br/>voice.<p>"You've been watching me for all of thirty seconds, I've been on high alert<br/>all afternoon and I would have noticed you no matter how much you try to<br/>conceal your presence." Ranma snapped.<p>The voice cackled several seconds before subsiding into quiet giggles.<br/>"You're right, I just wanted to see how you would react and to see if the<br/>information I received about you was entirely accurate. From what I've seen<br/>so far you are far more powerful than you look."<p>"Please come out where I can see you." Ranma said as she looked at the<br/>bush where the voice was coming from.<p>"I'll warn you ahead of time, I'm a fairy cat." Said the cat as its<br/>stepped out of the bushes and padded its way over to where Ranma was<br/>standing. "You may call me Ito."<p>She froze at the mere mention of the word cat and started to shiver as it<br/>stepped out and walked over to her. The fear of cats may have been taken<br/>care of, but the basic reaction to a cat was still very much ingrained into<br/>Ranma's mind. Ranma found that it took every ounce of her control to keep<br/>from running at the first glimpse of the large feline. It certainly wasn't<br/>of any particular breed that she recognized because of its red fur, but it<br/>certainly could not have ever been mistaken for a common house cat. Ito was<br/>a very large cat that could have easily been mistaken for a small bobcat, it<br/>had bright red fur and a crescent moon symbol upon its forehead.<p>"Hello Ito, I take it that your that cat the green haired lady told me<br/>about?"<p>Ito sweatdropped. "Green haired lady?"<p>"The only thing she called herself was a Time Lord or something, never<br/>actually gave me her name."<p>"She is Setsuna, Sailor Pluto, and the Guardian of Time. NOT a Time Lord!"<br/>Ito said arroganly.<p>"Whatever." Ranma returned with a smirk.<p>"Lady Pluto is to be honored for her sacrifices and her power!"<p>Ranma blinked. "Who is Lady Pluto?"<p>"Growl...Sailor Pluto is also the last living Princess of the Kingdom of<br/>Pluto. She is royalty in every way of the word."<p>"Lots of strange titles for some green haired chick." Ranma muttered under<br/>her breath.<p>"Green haired chick!" Ito snapped, her red fur standing on end.<p>"So tell me about yourself Ito." Ranma asked suddenly.<p>"Grrrr...I am to be your adviser, companion, and guardian if anything goes<br/>wrong."<p>"Why?"<p>"All Royalty is given the option of having a Farie Cat as an adviser, it is<br/>an honor and a privlege."<p>"So your like a talking pet?"<p>"What?"<p>"Oh I know, I need to get you a scratching post, some cat food, a collar,<br/>tags, shots...etc, etc..." Ranma said ditz like, her eyes sparkling.<p>Ito was starting to get mad and was putting off an aura of anger, she<br/>didn't see Ranma hide her smirk as she continued to list the things she<br/>would have to have done to have a pet. She sweat dropped and hissed in fury<br/>as Ranma listed giving her a flea bath, and popped her claws when she<br/>mentioned house training. Ito pounced on Ranma's ankle in righteous fury,<br/>or tired to. Ranma eeped and vanished as if teleported, Ito sailed through<br/>the after image of Ranma and slammed into the side of a tree with a loud<br/>thump. She slid the ground painfully, thinking that the first rule of all<br/>Fairy Cats had been broken fairly easily. Never hurt or attack one's<br/>companion, Ito groaned and added an amendment, unless they deserved it.<br/>Ranma peaked at Ito from her position in the tree branches and giggled, her<br/>fear of cats was truly gone. She hadn't been scared in the least little<br/>bit, just reacting as she always did around a cat and even that would be<br/>gone in a little while. She hopped down and hesitantly picked up the red<br/>fur ball as she fought off her flee reaction to a cat. This was going to take<br/>some time, she concluded.<p>Ranma hopped down and picked up the large red cat and wondered what she was<br/>going to fo with it. She cradled it as she carried it back to the shrine, so<br/>was lost in thought when she finished climbing the stairs. Which normally<br/>wouldn't have mattered, but she was still fighting her instincts when<br/>dealing with a cat.<p>"Hello Miss. Ranma!"<p>Ranma screamed and jumped to the top of the shrine, gasping for air she<br/>turned and saw that Rei's grandfather had walked out of the shrine. He was<br/>rolling on the ground laughing at her.<p>"Hello yourself." Ranma said, icily calm.<p>"What are you doing here?"<p>"You did offer me a place to stay didn't you?"<p>"I don't mean that, most everyone in town is over at the new carnival that<br/>opened up yesterday."<p>"This is the first I've heard of it, is that why the park is empty today?"<p>"Yep, your the first good looking girl I've seen since yesterday." The old<br/>man sighed as if the world was coming to an end.<p>Ranma glared at him. "Why did everyone go to this place?"<p>"Free food."<p>"Free food? You don't say, sounds like a place I have to check out." Ranma<br/>said and turned and ran down the stairs in a cloud of dust.<p>Gramps shrugged as he stood back up and smiled, he stood there pretending<br/>to look at a non-existent watch. He was counting under his breath and<br/>looked up at where Ranma had vanished a few seconds before, to see the<br/>energetic red head bounce back up the stairs. "3-2-1..."<p>"Hey old man, where is this place?" Ranma yelled from the top of the<br/>stairs, rubbing the back of her head and giggling nervously.<p>"At the edge of the district, about ten miles from here."<p>"Thanks!" Ranma yelled and bounced off into the trees.<p>**********<p>The place was called Dream Land, it had to be the stupidest name she had<br/>ever heard in her life. Ranma gagged a little at the sight of the park<br/>itself, it was all castles, romantic rides, and cute animals. Just a few of<br/>the things she avoided if she could get away with it, but the alure of free<br/>food was just to tempting to pass up. She was about to make her way across<br/>the giant parking lot when she heard something weird.<p>"Mommy, mommy! Why is that girl on top of that bus, she's cute, can I go up<br/>there too, !" Said this<br/>little boy down below.<p>Ranma groaned and sweatdropped as she realized she had been standing on top<br/>of a tour bus full of guests for the park. There were several family's that<br/>had just disembarked and were gaping at her in an annoying way. Then it got<br/>worse, all the commotion attracted the bus driver and he stepped into view<br/>and glared up at her. Ranma tried to look as innocent as she could, eyes<br/>wide, sparkling, and a little giggling could work wonders she'd found.<p>"Hey you, on top of the bus, you owe me some money. I don't let anyone<br/>freeload on my bus!" Yelled the driver as he climbed up on the bus, not<br/>fooled in the least.<p>"Drat!" Ranma yelled as she launched off the bus, to the top of a nearby<br/>car, and to another bus that was just driving by. She landed and waved good<br/>by to ranting driver of the other bus and grinned, this time she would get<br/>off before it stopped. Ten minutes later Ranma stepped into the park, she<br/>had almost decided not to go when she found out just how much a ticket cost<br/>to get in, she was nearly broke. Luckily there had been a young guy working<br/>the line she chose, he had given her a discount when she smiled at him and<br/>blinked her eyes. Boy's were idiots, she had found out pretty quickly<br/>during her trip across China after ditching her father.<p>The park was even worse inside, though she did see some things she liked as<br/>she wandered around. There were these robotic animals running around with<br/>little kids on them, their parents in the back round laughing at them. A<br/>lady dressed up as a robotic princess of some kind or another was controlling<br/>the animals with a control disguised as an apple. For some reason the scene<br/>gave her the creeps so she avoided the unnatural thing easily. She could feel<br/>the princess thing watching her as she walked away from the sickening cute<br/>scene. Ranma continued to explore around the park for an hour or so before<br/>she found the free food, it was candies and cakes at a nearby castle. She<br/>shuddered and wondered why something like this was so...damned cute. Still,<br/>she suppressed her gag reflex and headed inside just as they were closing<br/>the doors, slipping in just behind a blonde girl with the oddest hair style.<br/>She had a friend with her that looked a little familiar, but Ranma blinked<br/>as she realized that she had encountered the girl at the temple the day she<br/>came by to drop off those scrolls...two or three days ago.<p>"Are you here for the free candy too?" Usagi asked the red head that had<br/>slipped in with them.<p>"Yep, I can never pass up free sweets." Ranma said with a grin. She had<br/>found out early that she had sweet tooth in this new body, things like candy<br/>and suckers were great, chocolate was to die for, and she could eat ice<br/>cream by the barrel full.<p>Usagi giggled and nodded. "I can believe that! I'm Usagi Tsukino and this<br/>is my friend Rei Hino."<p>"We've met." Rei said.<p>"Ranma Saotome, martial arts extraordinaire."<p>"Ohhhh! Martial Arts, that is so cool!" Usagi said, she looked as spaced as<br/>she sounded too.<p>Rei rolled her eyes, but after what she witnessed when the girl had toasted<br/>Jedite with her bare hands, she was willing to believe it.<p>Ranma giggled at the girl's facial expression. "Yep, I'm the best there is<br/>too."<p>"So what kind of candies and junk food do you think were going to find<br/>here?"<p>"Probably the usual stuff..." Ranma said, but trailed off as the hallway<br/>was beginning to fill with smoke. "...what's going on?"<p>"Huh?" Asked Usagi as she just started to notice the smoke.<p>"I sense danger here!" Rei said, looking around franticly.<p>"I do to, but nothing to bad." Ranma said, she could feel something evil<br/>nearby, but it was pathetically weak.<p>"What do you mean my that? It's practically dripping off the walls!" Rei<br/>yelled in Ranma's ear.<p>Ranma winced and backed off, this girl had a real problem with being nice<br/>it seemed. She lashed out at whoever seemed to be a good target for her<br/>temper, even at the temple she had yelled at her for startling her that way.<br/>It seemed she wasn't all that nice of a person, well, Ranma decided not to<br/>go that far. Maybe she had a good reason for being so...<p>"Hey Usagi, why is your friend such a grouch?" Ranma asked loud enough for<br/>all of them to hear, she grinned innocently.<p>"WHAT?" Rei yelled.<p>Usagi blinked as she was distracted from the smoke filling the hallway.<br/>"For as long as I've known her, I thing she just likes to be mad at people."<br/>Usagi said helpfully.<p>"USAGI!" Rei yelled, her friends pig tails trailing away behind her from<br/>the power of the yell.<p>"Well she is a good friend too, though she tends to get a little vocal."<p>"I noticed that the other day too when she yelled at me for running up the<br/>temple steps." Ranma said, watching Rei out of the corner of her eye.<p>Rei growled. "You nearly ran me down!"<p>"I missed you by a mile when I flipped over you."<p>"You nearly took my head off with that stunt!"<p>"Oh please, I haven't messed up a flip like that since I was eight years<br/>old and that was because the old fart had greased the rocks I was using to<br/>practice on." Ranma stated and folded her arms across her chest and nodded<br/>superiorly.<p>"W-why y-y-you arrogant piece of sh..." Rei turned red and her battle aura<br/>started to form up when she was interrupted by the appearance of the robotic<br/>princess.<p>"Hah, like your any better Miss. Temper Tantrum." Ranma yelled right back.<p>"Ex-cuse Me, but I-I would like t-o..."<p>"Shut up!" Ranma and Rei yell out and punched the thing, in the face, at<br/>the same time.<p>With a deafening clang the would be robotic princess is hit with enough<br/>force to dent it's metal body, it fly's back and crashes though a wall. It's<br/>body is cracked and shattered where Rei and Ranma had hit it and it's<br/>illusion flickers on and off, going from super cute princess to this really<br/>ugly brown and green mockery of the princess. It would have been really<br/>scary if it hadn't been imbedded in a wall with the occasional spark going<br/>off.<p>"Now look what you did you tomboy!" Ranma yelled.<p>"I'm not the one that hit it so hard idiot!" Rei countered.<p>"Picky, picky!"<p>"Y-you...you...you..." Rei growled and punched Ranma in the face, only to<br/>see her smile suddenly and cock her head to the side so that her fist misses<br/>by mere millimeters.<p>"That all you got?" Ranma asks with a smirk.<p>"Wow!" Usagi says, her eyes wide.<p>"H-how did you do that?" Rei gasps.<p>"Just reflex really, ten years on the road with my old man learning the Art<br/>and you could do it to."<p>"Ten years..."<p>"Yep, you've got potential at this you know, just the right amount of anger<br/>and violence. This was a lot of fun Rei, we have to do it again sometime. I<br/>haven't had a decent argument since I ditched the old man a few months ago."<br/>Ranma said with a beautiful smile.<p>Rei blinked in confusion.<p>"Let's go and grab some of that candy." Ranma said, turning to go back down<br/>the hall. Usagi right on her heels.<p>"You aren't going anywhere." Says the princess as she climbs back to her<br/>feet shakily. She opens her mouth and this red mist gushes out and quickly<br/>fills the hall, it starts to make all of them a little dizzy. Ranma had<br/>tensed at the sound of her voice and spun around just in time to get a face<br/>full of the red mist, she staggers down the hall a ways and leans against<br/>the closed doors to the main hall.<p>Ranma shakes her head and tires to clear it of the strange hallucinogenic<br/>effect it seems to have. Down the hall she hears the girls and realizes that<br/>she had accidentally left them behind. She staggers back up the hall just as<br/>there is this red and white flash of light that temporarily blinds her, but<br/>her senses suddenly pick up two very power full sources of power that seen<br/>oddly familiar. This needs looking into, Ranma thinks and concentrate and<br/>uses her Ki to clear her mind.<p>For a few seconds it seems to be working and she sees this odd mockery of<br/>the robotic princess floating above the floor holding a glowing apple, but<br/>her mind can't hold the image and she finds herself in this meadow. She sees<br/>some movement off in the distance and sees one of the Scouts she had met the<br/>other day when she fought Jedite, Sailor Mars. She didn't recognize the<br/>other one, but assumed it was the one that had been asleep on the roof,<br/>Sailor Moon. The princess was handing this wreath of flowers to Moon when<br/>Mars yelled and grabbed it out of the princess' hand, yelped and snatched her<br/>hand back. Ranma gasped as the wreath turned into a snake as it hit the<br/>ground and turned to stone.<p>Mars looks at her fingers as they turn to stone, it is obvious that she is<br/>in shock, but Ranma has other ideas. They need help, but stops before she<br/>even moves as Mars curses the princess and holds out her stone covered arm,<br/>her eyes close and she suddenly bursts into a fire like aura and mumbling<br/>the Shinto chant used to focus their concentration in meditation. To her<br/>amazed and relieved eyes, Mars' arm turns back to normal and she sighs in<br/>relief.<p>"Your alright!" Moon yells.<p>"We need to get out of this..." Mars snarls back.<p>Ranma looked around the area, but couldn't find any sign of Usagi or Rei<br/>anywhere in sight. She was beginning to worry about them when something<br/>occurred to her and she took a closer look at the Scouts. At first Ranma was<br/>amazed when her mind refused to even detail the faces of the girls, but she<br/>used all her will power to see what she needed to see. The crescent moon<br/>flared to life on her forehead again and suddenly she could see Usagi and Rei,<br/>plain as day, dressed up as Sailor Scouts. Ranma nearly fell on her butt in<br/>shock, she did gape in total confusion though and missed the princess<br/>transform into her Youma form.<p>"I'm your dream dolly, do you want to play?" Says the Youma.<p>Mars brings up her hands to fire off a blast when Moon runs forward and<br/>pulls off her Tiara. The Youma opens it's doll like mouth and fires out more<br/>red mist, completely enveloping the two scouts. Ranma gasps as the the<br/>Scouts take on this slack jawed look for a second, their eyes light up and<br/>Ranma is relieved that they shook off what ever was affecting them. Then to<br/>her amusement, the two girl's suddenly grab a couple of brooms from nowhere,<br/>straddle them and begin to hop around like a couple of little kids riding<br/>horses.<p>'Now I can put them completely under my power.' Thinks the Youma as it<br/>raises it's apple.<p>Ducking behind a nearby tree, Ranma is about to transform when she spots<br/>two things that make her hesitate. The first is this total moron in a full<br/>tuxedo, top hat, and a mask that just ran into the room from somewhere. He<br/>reaches into his cape and Ranma tenses, but he pulls out a red rose and she<br/>shakes her head at the stupidity of this idiot. She hated his fashion sence,<br/>and now she had to save him from his own stupidity. He suddenly threw the<br/>rose and to Ranma's surprise she could pick up the magical enchantment as it<br/>was thrown like a hand held throwing spike. The damned thing actually flyies<br/>out and knocks the apple out of the Youma's hand, it's enough to<br/>actually impress Ranma for all of half a second. Then the idiot opens his<br/>mouth and spouts off this drivel to encourage the girls.<p>"Don't let her get into your dreams Scouts!" Tuxedo Mask yells and runs<br/>off. For some reason this actually helps the girl's get their focus back and<br/>they turn to confront the Youma again. Ranma face faults as the illusion<br/>falls to reveal the Scouts riding the brooms. They both turn red, drop the<br/>brooms, and jump back in embarrassment.<p>The second thing Ranma notices is this blue haired girl staggering down the<br/>hall form the main room where the free food was supposed to be. She stops<br/>and pulls this pen out of nowhere and holds it up. Ranma's eyes narrow as<br/>she yells "Mercury Power, Make-Up!" and transforms into Sailor Mercury.<br/>Ranma didn't know her name, but she had a feeling she would know it soon<br/>enough. Mercury runs past Ranma's hiding place and the Scouts confront the<br/>Youma. Ranma witnesses Mercury lay down a fog bank while Mars and Moon<br/>combine this frisky attack and blow the monster away.<p>That had been something Ranma hadn't been expecting, the attack must have<br/>tripled in power when they combined like that, she realized. Then the<br/>monster turned to dust and castle faded away around them, it must have been<br/>part of the monsters powers or something. She slipped away in the confusion<br/>that followed and was surprised to find Usagi, Rei, and a blue haired girl<br/>all standing off to the side and watching the police go over the now empty<br/>lot where the castle had been. Ambulances had been called to take care of<br/>the thirty or so victims of the attack.<p>"Usagi!" Ranma called.<p>The girl screamed and jumped five feet in the air, flailed around, and<br/>landed on Rei. This took the girl down and she tripped Ami and they all went<br/>down in a pile. Ami's skirt rode up as she was pulled down Ranma got a<br/>pretty good look at her blue panties when she landed on top of Rei. Ranma<br/>blinked several times before falling over laughing, the great Sailor Scouts<br/>were a bunch of untrained, clumsy girls.<p>"Stop laughing!" Rei yelled.<p>"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" Usagi cried.<p>Ami just blushed and pulled her skirt down as far as it would go.<p>"BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"<p>To Be Continued...<p>**********<p>Note - Now were getting somewhere, the next story will be the love cruise<br/>episode and is going to be nothing like the original and what I'm planning<br/>to with Titus is just plain evil. Comments on this chapter are wanted, I<br/>especially want to know if you like the way things are going or not. I want<br/>feed back on this one, I plan on doing the next episode, but after that it<br/>is up in the air because I don't know if this should be continued past that.<br/>So please email me and let me know...
