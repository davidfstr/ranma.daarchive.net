</div>**********<br/>Princess of the Moon<br/>Chapter 03<br/>By C. Rose<br/>(c)2001<p>**********<p>The rain is coming down pretty hard by the time the early evening has<br/>fallen over the Nerima district. The large panda walks tiredly down the<br/>deserted streets lugging a rather large back pack. The panda is walking on<br/>it's hind legs, head down, and shivering from the cold rain. It large<br/>stomach growls as it passes a small yati, it's owner is manning the grill,<br/>staring wide eyed at the large and dangerous animal that stops and glares at<br/>him. Then sweat drops as it's mouth opens and starts to drool, he gulps and<br/>backs away slowly as the panda steals several bowls of spiced ramen. The<br/>panda pats it's stomach, growls and turns to walk away, but lets off a<br/>massive fart a few steps later. The yati owner stares at the empty bowls of<br/>ramen in shock and falls over as the smell hits him.<p>"Damned thing knew how to use chop sticks."<p>About ten blocks away and thirty minutes later, the panda stops in front of<br/>a large wooden gate and pushes his way through. The loud creek of old and<br/>wet timber echoes over the entire compound and alerts the occupants that<br/>they have a visitor. Kasumi smiles and gets up to see who is at their door,<br/>but stops in mid step as a giant panda stalks it's way into the front room<br/>and looks over the startled family. It whips out a wooden sign with writing<br/>on it.<p>*Can I have a glass of hot water, not boiling?*<p>"Daddy, since when do panda's know how to write?" Asked Nabiki.<p>Soun, shakes his head in shock as he considers running for his armor and<br/>family sword. He was expecting his old friend Genma Saotome, not an escaped<br/>panda from the circus. "I have no idea, I suppose we should call the pound<br/>or the zoo or some thing."<p>*Don't call anyone, the hot water will be fine and it will explain all you<br/>need to know.* The panda signs.<p>"Here you go Mr. Panda-chan." Kasumi says as she hands the panda a large<br/>bowl of hot water.<p>*Thank you, Kasumi.*<p>"Daddy, it knows my name already!"<p>The panda pours the hot water over his head and growls in pain as the<br/>boiling water does it's work. The panda shrinks down and an older man in a<br/>white gi and a scarf on it's head takes it's place. "Thanks for not<br/>panicking Soun old buddy." Genma says.<p>Soun, Kasumi, and Nabiki all faint from shock.<p>"They took that better than I thought, well while they are indisposed I'll<br/>just help myself to dinner." Genma sits down and smiles at the one girl<br/>still conscious. "Do you mind if I have some of this? I haven't eaten in<br/>days."<p>Akane shakes her head and faints.<p>"Good old Soun, always had such a good spread of food on the table. Ah how<br/>I've missed those days." Genma said for anyone pretending to be unconscious<br/>before eating every bit of food on the table in about two minutes flat. He<br/>lets off a titanic belch and pats his stomach as it digests the snack.<p>"Oh I dreamed Genma stopped by..." Soun mumbled as he sat up and rubbed his<br/>head.<p>"I did!" Genma says, looking the table over for more food.<p>"Genma? B-b-b-b-but w-what happened t-to you? Where you really just a<br/>panda?" Soun yells, the girls begin to wake up slowly.<p>"That was me alright, picked up a nasty curse in China while training the<br/>boy, I wish I had never taken him there."<p>"Where is Ranma, we can have the wedding tomorrow if he wants to wait that<br/>long!" Soun said as he looked around for Genma's son.<p>"I'm afraid the boy is lost my friend." Genma says sadly.<p>"WHAT?" Soun yells and wakes up the girls.<p>"Ranma is missing, I know he is somewhere here in Japan, but I have no idea<br/>where to even start looking."<p>"Genma, we have to find him at all costs!"<p>"I know, but he's been missing for several months now."<p>"Daddy what are you talking about?" Nabiki asks as she sits up, leans<br/>against the table, and notices that all the food is gone and that there are<br/>several pieces of rice sticking to the stomach of the man in the white gi.<br/>She looks at the empty bowls, enough to feed all of them easily, and glares<br/>at this Genma. He starts to sweat.<p>"Yes daddy, please tell us what is going on." Kasumi says, glancing at<br/>Genma and then the table and smiles.<p>Akane just glares, she hadn't had a chance to dig in yet. "..."<p>"I figure now is as good a time as any to tell you about the agreement me<br/>and Genma here made before any of you were born. You see we made a deal that<br/>we would unite our families and since I had all daughters, Genma here has<br/>been teaching his son martial arts for over ten years now to prepare him for<br/>a marriage to one of you."<p>Kasumi blinks a few times and sighs as she goes into the kitchen.<p>Nabiki perks up. "Is he cute?"<p>Akane snarls. "I Hate Boys!" and stalks out of the room, up stairs to her<br/>room and slams the door so hard it shakes the floor boards, some dust falls<br/>from the ceiling to cover Genma.<p>"Oh dear." Kasumi says as she comes back out and sets out small bowls of<br/>food for everybody. Genma inhales his so fast that it is empty by the time<br/>she takes her hand away and hands a bowl to her father.<p>"So your saying that we have to get married no matter what, is that it?"<br/>Nabiki tries again.<p>"Only if Ranma was to pick you." Genma states, eyeing her food.<p>"Ranma is to unite our schools of martial arts Nabiki, I was hoping that<br/>one of you three girls would marry him and continue the schools."<p>"But father we've never met him and from what your friend here has said,<br/>Ranma is missing."<p>"We'll find him one way or another, the schools future depends on it!" Soun<br/>declared as he stood up and posed nobly. Genma grins and jumps to his feet<br/>too, the two grown men link arms and spin around in a circle. "We will<br/>implement operation 'Find the Groom!" They two old men chorused and ran out<br/>the front door.<p>"Oh My, father hasn't had that much energy in years!" Kasumi said, handing<br/>Nabiki a proper bowl of food.<p>"Kasumi, I'm surprised, you didn't offer this to Genma?"<p>"He did eat everything else sister."<p>"I don't like him one bit."<p>"He seems to be a bit rough around the edges doesn't he?" Kasumi said and<br/>dug into her own food.<p>"I HATE BOYS!" Akane screamed from her room, stomped down the stairs in<br/>her gi and headed to the dojo.<p>"That reminds me, has Doc. Tofu gotten over his little problem yet?" Nabiki<br/>asked with a smirk.<p>Kasumi sighed and shook her head. "I can't believe one little kiss did that<br/>to him, I mean it was totally innocent. Wasn't it?"<p>"Well you did stick your tongue in his mouth Kasumi and he was raised in an<br/>old fashioned environment and all. He wasn't prepared for a modern type girl<br/>like you to take the first steps, unless you did something else you didn't<br/>tell me about?"<p>Kasumi blushed and started to quickly grab the dishes, there were so many<br/>to clean tonight.<p>"Kasumi?"<p>"..."<p>"Kasumi?"<p>She was distracted by her father and Genma-panda running through the back<br/>yard with the push cart, talking excitedly about the best ways to subdue a<br/>run away groom. Nabiki rolled her eyes and tried to think of a way to earn<br/>some money off this, she decided not to press Kasumi for details just yet.<br/>She got up and headed into the dojo where Akane was obliterating large<br/>cinder blocks with her fists, or tossing them in the air and shattering them<br/>with her hands and feet.<p>"Akane?"<p>"I can't believe that ass wants us to marry some boy out of the blue, we've<br/>never met him."<p>"I don't think it will be that bad Akane, it is a great meal ticket to free<br/>money and free food for the rest of your life. What's to complain about?"<p>"You've got to be kidding?"<p>"Why should I, he may be major league cute or something and dumb jocks are<br/>so easy to play with."<p>"Boys are idiots and perverts!" Akane yells and crushes a block with her<br/>foot.<p>"Suit yourself Akane, but I'm not about to burn my bridges before I have<br/>all the information."<p>"The world doesn't revolve around boys Nabiki!"<p>Nabiki shrugged, this could be perfect, especially with her little problem.<br/>"Whatever Akane."<p>In the distance they can all hear Soun yelling Ranma's name at the top of<br/>his lungs as they search for Ranma. Nabiki rolls her eyes again, she should<br/>have known better than to think her father would have good idea for once.<br/>She would put this Ranma's name out on the network in the morning and what<br/>kind of fish she hooked. This could be fun she thought, throw out a line and<br/>reel in a husband to use and control for the rest of her life. She smiled<br/>cruelly, her eyes glinting with evil ideas already.<p>**********<p>It was 4am when Ranma rolled out of bed and complained that she missed<br/>sleeping on her stomach, one of the few things it seemed girl's couldn't do<br/>because of their breasts. Laying on them actually hurt, which confused her<br/>since she had endured the Bakusai Tenketsu when Shampoo trained for it.<br/>Though it wasn't as effective as she would have liked, Cologne had said it<br/>took time for the near total invulnerability to take effect and that meant<br/>practicing it for hours on end. Something she hadn't had time to do since<br/>arriving in Juban a few days ago, she was hoping to stumble across a quarry.<br/>She had found that those were the best places to practice and earn a little<br/>money too.<p>Of course she had been helping to fight off the creatures being sent by<br/>that blonde moron Jed-something or another. Blondie fit him better, the<br/>arrogant jerk, she had proven to be his match before she became one of the<br/>Scouts. Luckily it seemed they didn't need her help all the time, the fight<br/>with that princess thing over at the amusement park had proven that they<br/>were not totally useless. Only that they needed help in other areas, like<br/>how to actually fight or walk or even breath for that matter. They were<br/>depending on their magical powers completely, how did they think to win if<br/>they came up against something that could neutralize that power? Of the<br/>three girls, she figured Rei, was the most trainable and the easiest to<br/>reach, the next was the blue haired girl since she seemed to possess a keen<br/>mind and thought of defense before the rest of the team even attacked.<p>Lastly was Usagi, Sailor Moon, the cry baby and scared little girl. Ranma<br/>was worried about her the most. The other two were very mature for being so<br/>young, but Usagi was totally off the wall for a fourteen year old girl. At<br/>sixteen Ranma had endured more in her life than most do in a life time and<br/>her life was bound to get worse and worse as time went on due to the magic<br/>of Jusenkyo. In the past few months she had been forced to do a lot of soul<br/>searching and it had brought out a number of things she hadn't liked.<br/>Cologne had helped her to grow into a somewhat normal girl, but her male<br/>attitude was something that was etched right into her soul and she couldn't<br/>become a true girl if she even wanted to. The old bat disagreed, but the<br/>price to do so was so repulsive that Ranma couldn't even think about it.<br/>Then there had been that little biology lesson during that first month,<br/>Ranma shuddered. Definitely to much to pay.<p>She trudged over to her closet and put on her workout clothes, spandex<br/>shorts, a sports bra, and a tight t-shirt. How something so female could<br/>make her feel so comfortable was amazing, she had borrowed a similar out fit<br/>from one of her friends at the Amazon Village and spent several hours of<br/>hard practice marveling at the sturdy construction of the strange material.<br/>Ito, a talking cat of all things, was sprawled out on the floor by the<br/>window and almost reminded Ranma of her father after a drunken binge at the<br/>local bar. She decided not to wake up the newest oddity in her life and made<br/>her way out of the room. Ranma yawned as she stepped out into the back area<br/>of the shrine and headed into the woods around the place. The temple was at<br/>the top of a large hill in the center of the district, this in turn bordered<br/>a large park used by all the local fitness obsessed. Ranma had found it the<br/>day before when Rei took them home through the park instead of up the<br/>stairs, the girl's had been to tired to climb all those steps so instead<br/>chose to make her way up the slow incline to the park instead at three times<br/>the distance to reach the shrine.<p>Ranma reached the main trail of the park, it was a little over eight miles<br/>long around the entire thing according to Rei. She fell into her special way<br/>of breathing and was soon sprinting along at an incredible pace, passing<br/>dozens of runners along the way. Several men saw her, started to drool, and<br/>tried to keep up with her, but they quickly lost interest when she kept up<br/>the brutal pace she had set. Even more face faulted when she lapped them a<br/>half hour later and moving at the same brutal pace, she grinned as some of<br/>them groaned. On her third lap of the park she focused and sent her Ki into<br/>her legs and was soon moving faster than an Olympic sprinter and ran the<br/>eight miles in an impossible twenty minutes flat! After cooling down for<br/>several minutes she searched around and soon found a secluded spot between<br/>the shrine and the park and started to go through her newest kata, still<br/>pushing her body to it's fullest.<p>The small black cat that was watching from the bushes was frozen in awe as<br/>she saw the impossible done like it meant nothing. Thirty foot jumps, while<br/>untransformed, and a hang time of several second while kicking and punching<br/>at speeds beyond anything she had ever seen. Luna would have sworn that she<br/>was possessed by a youma or something if she hadn't witnessed this girl<br/>punch Jedite so hard that he collapsed to his knees. The pain in his face<br/>had been to real to be faked and he had tried a couple of more times to get<br/>revenge, but this Ranma was proving to be stronger than him. Then there was<br/>her senses, they were picking up nothing but Silver Millennium energy from<br/>the girl, tons of it. Luna continued to watch as Ranma went through a dozen<br/>or more very complicated kata in midair before landing on one foot with more<br/>grace than an Olympic gymnast.<p>Focusing inward, Ranma called forth her aura and focused her Ki. It burst<br/>forth easily, much easier than it ever had. Her aura was now a pure white<br/>with yellow and blue flecks of energy flowing around like small lightning<br/>bolts. What startled her was the sheer amount of power she was feeling and<br/>realized that her magic had mixed into her Ki energies and amplified them.<br/>"Oh great, like I wasn't strong enough before, now it's at least five times<br/>stronger than what it was a few days ago. I hadn't even had time to master<br/>my old strength and now I have to put up with more?" Ranma muttered to<br/>herself.<p>For the next half hour Ranma ran through her control exercises,<br/>creating balls of energy and holding them in place with her mind alone,<br/>moving them around slowly in certain patterns, and forcing them to reshape<br/>themselves into different shapes like squares and triangles. She failed of<br/>course, but got a lot closer than she had the last time she tied that super<br/>hard training. The old woman's demonstration had looked so damned simple,<br/>but to actually do it was a strain she hadn't considered before. She had<br/>nearly pushed herself into unconsciousness before she had collapsed from<br/>stress of manipulating pure energy with her mind alone, it was a challenge<br/>so she was still trying to get it even after all these months. Ranma stopped<br/>and knelt down, sweat dripping off her like water, she gasped for air as her<br/>body slowly returned to normal and she reigned in her Ki and suppressed it<br/>for safety sake.<p>It was pushing 7am when Ranma decided to head inside and take a bath, she<br/>used her towel to wipe the sweat of her face and waved to Rei as she was<br/>sweeping the front walk way. The girl glared at her and snapped the top of<br/>her broom off, then stared at it in shock. Ranma just smirked as she entered<br/>the bathroom and got ready for the day, her workout had been pretty intense<br/>this morning and her muscles were actually sore. She was just relaxing in<br/>the furo when Ito sauntered in and glared at her.<p>"What?" Ranma muttered.<p>"Why didn't you wake me up?"<p>"You just looked so restful sprawled out on the floor like that."<p>"I'm supposed to be your adviser, how can I do that if you ditch me?"<p>Ranma shrugged. "Okay cat, advise me."<p>"We need to get you trained in your new powers so that you can help out the<br/>other Scouts."<p>"Do you know who they are?"<p>"No, but there is supposed to be another farie cat around here somewhere<br/>who can get me caught up."<p>"Then your in luck Ito, for I found you." Said a female voice.<p>Ranma and Ito turn to look at a black cat walk into the furo and sit down.<br/>It was a normal sized house cat, black with a crescent moon on it's<br/>forehead. "Who are you?" Ito asked.<p>"Luna."<p>"The only Luna I know died centuries ago." Ito snapped.<p>"I was put into suspended animation for this job, Queen Serenity made sure<br/>I would survive to do it."<p>"Suspended animation? Isn't that dangerous for us to do, I seem to remember<br/>something about the process having some kind of effect on our minds."<p>Luna sighs. "My memory is total Swiss cheese, I only remember bits and<br/>pieces."<p>Ranma stares at yet another talking cat and knows that it isn't telling the<br/>whole truth, how, she had no idea. Her new senses were telling her things<br/>that were hard to process, she had been trying to deal with the increased<br/>range of her senses ever since the change had taken place. One of them was<br/>this ability to 'see' magical auras, and Luna's was very different than<br/>Ito's aura. "Luna, both of you are farie cats right?"<p>"Yes we are."<p>"Then why is you aura so much different than Ito's aura?"<p>"What do you mean by different Ranma?" Ito said, looking at Luna and<br/>narrowing her eyes.<p>"Ito your aura is a yellowish red and seems to be normal for what I<br/>understand of them, but Luna's is almost gray and streaked with dozens of<br/>different color."<p>"Can you still transform Luna?" Ito asked.<p>"Transform?" Ranma and Luna asked.<p>"You don't remember how to transform Luna, that is surprising, but your<br/>aura seems to have been altered to keep you from doing it."<p>"I don't know what your talking about."<p>Ito shrugged her shoulders and shifted, her body shifted and grew in a<br/>matter of seconds into a good looking red head girl. She had a simple white<br/>dress on, Ranma had no idea where it came from, and smirked down at Luna.<br/>The silver crescent moon on their heads glowed and some thing seemed to pass<br/>between them as they glowed. Ranma sat there in the furo and watched in<br/>fascination as Luna suddenly glowed, a piece of her aura flared and<br/>shattered, and Luna shifted into her human form.<p>Where Ito was good looking, Luna was stunning, she was barely over five<br/>foot and had thick black curls of hair that ran down her back. She had a<br/>form fitting yellow dress with petty coats and a fantastic body. Ranma<br/>wondered why it was suddenly so warm in the bathroom, but shook it off. Luna<br/>stumbled around a little and leaned against the wall for support. Ranma<br/>noticed suddenly that both girl's were growing more good looking by the<br/>second, to ignore it she finished soaking and grabbed her towel to dry off.<p>Rei chose that exact time to step into the bathroom to let Ranma know that<br/>breakfast was ready, so she got a good look at Ranma's fantastic nude body<br/>as she was drying off and two other girls watching with interest. She<br/>blinked and growled as she stalked over to Ranma, grabbed her by the arm and<br/>twisted. "YOU PERVERT, I WILL NOT LET YOU GET AWAY WITH DOING PERVERTED<br/>THINGS IN MY BATHROOM!" Rei screamed.<p>Luna and Ito blinked in confusion.<p>"Huh?" Ranma got out.<p>"I DON'T WANT YOUR SICK PERVERTED WAYS IN MY HOME!"<p>"What are you talking about?" Ranma asked as she stood up and unconsciously<br/>broke Rei's grip on her arm. "These are friends Rei, they were just here<br/>to..."<p>"You pervert!" Rei slapped her.<p>"What's going on?" Rei's grandfather yelled from the bathroom door, luckily<br/>it was closed.<p>"Rei's throwing a hissy fit Gramps." Ranma called, sticking her tongue out<br/>at Rei.<p>She pales and backs up a few steps. "I am not!"<p>"You two stop playing around, you need to get to school okay?"<p>"Sure Gramps!" Ranma called out. She stepped closer to Rei and looked her<br/>in the eyes and grinned. "I think I finally figured out what you were<br/>thinking Rei, I wasn't sure at first, but now I am."<p>"W-what?" Rei squeaked.<p>Luna and Ito just watched in fascination as Ranma leaned in close and<br/>rubbed herself up against Rei and smiled, purring a little. Rei blushed and<br/>backed up against the wall, trying to stay away from Ranma. "I know the<br/>truth now Rei, you can't hide it from me anymore."<p>"I-I don't know what your t-talking about!"<p>Ranma dropped her towel to the floor and Rei blushed even harder if it was<br/>possible. "I know your interested in me Rei." She whispered, leaning in for<br/>a kiss, sparkles in her eyes. "But I'm not really interested right now,<br/>maybe in a few months I'll change my mind cute stuff." Ranma says suddenly<br/>and steps back and shrugs, grinning in a knowing way.<p>Ito and Luna face fault.<p>"WHAT?" Rei yells out and punched Ranma with all her might to send her<br/>flying back into the furo with a giant splash. Then stomped out of the room,<br/>slamming the door behind her. Bubbles come to the surface where Ranma's face<br/>was plastered to the bottom of the furo, her legs hanging off the side in a<br/>decidedly inappropriate manor.<p>**********<p>Breakfast was a quiet affair for Ranma a she breezed through her cereal and<br/>eggs. Rei glared at her and spent all her time keeping the table between her<br/>and Ranma. Ranma smiled at her and went out of her way to make suggestive<br/>motions as she ate and had Rei blushing a solid red by the time she<br/>finished. She started with hers cereal and lapped the milk out of the bowl<br/>like a cat and smiled at Rie, licking her lips and letting a little drip off<br/>her chin. From there she moved on to more and more suggestive things until<br/>Rei grabbed her stuff and fled the temple as soon as she could. She was<br/>still blushing as she ran down the stairs and wondering why visions of a<br/>naked Ranma were still in her mind, the feel of her breasts as she rubbed up<br/>against her, and the smell of her hair...Rei had to stop at the bottom of<br/>the stairs and bang her head against the wall for awhile to clear it.<p>"Mommy, why is she doing that?"<p>Rei twitched while still resting her head against the slightly cracked<br/>wall.<p>"Don't look at the crazy girl, honey." Said a mother as they edged around<br/>Rei. "You don't want to end up like her, do you?"<p>"Hey!" Rei yelled.<p>They ran for it.<p>Ranma snickered from the steps as she waved at the seething Rei and jumped<br/>to a nearby roof and took off. Rei screamed and ran after her, but Ranma<br/>soon lost her and enjoyed the morning run. Running in a skirt was a pain,<br/>but she always wore a pair of shorts under the skirts to keep the boys from<br/>peaking. She dropped out of the sky and landed beside one of the boys who<br/>were always scooping out the girl's as they entered the grounds, he screamed<br/>and turned to run, but ran right into a wall knocking himself cold. This was<br/>only her fourth day at Jubaan High and she was surprised to see that she had<br/>already acquired a reputation for not tolerating the boys trying to make the<br/>move on her. She had even had to go so far as to beat one unconscious when<br/>he lifted up her dress unexpectedly, the fact that he did it on a dare meant<br/>nothing.<p>Then there was the fact that a lot of the girl's were beginning to look up<br/>to her as some kind of role model was a little disturbing, but Usagi, whom<br/>Ranma had made friends with, said to let them have their fun and it could<br/>only help them. For a total ditz it had actually made sense, and her other<br/>friend Ami (the blue haired girl from the castle) had said Usagi had these<br/>rare moments of wisdom. Ranma just figured the girl was being sneaky.<p>Speaking of the blonde, Ranma watched from the classroom window as the<br/>warning bell rang and was in the perfect position to see Usagi sped through<br/>the front gates just as they were closing. A trail of dust followed behind<br/>her as she hit the front door and made her way up stairs. Ranma followed<br/>Usagi's way through the school with her ears as she ran into a couple of<br/>janitors since the sound of falling water buckets and the sounds of the<br/>janitors cussing in Chinese was easily heard, Ranma saw Ami blush. Then<br/>Usagi fell on the freshly waxed floor, and plowed through the door to the<br/>class room and slid into the desks at the front of the room in an explosion<br/>of chaos. It was one of Usagi's better entrances, this time she managed to<br/>take four other girls with her when she stopped. There was enough flesh and<br/>panties showing in the pile that half the guys in class had to grab their<br/>noses to stop the blood flow, the other half passed out. Well there was that<br/>one guy in the back of the class, but a Japanese student with a lisp was<br/>terrible thing to see.<p>"Usagi!" Mrs. Haruna yelled as she entered the classroom.<p>"Sorry Mrs. Haruna?" Usagi mumbled from the bottom of the pile of stunned<br/>girls.<p>"Detention!"<p>Usagi just groaned and dug herself out of the pile of desks and limbs and<br/>trudged her way back to her seat. She smiled weakly at Ranma, who was trying<br/>not to laugh at her friend. She got up and helped the girls Usagi hit as<br/>they extracted themselves out of the pile. Ranma ended up helping one of<br/>them to the nurses office as well. Usagi ended up tagging along with them<br/>apologizing a mile a minute, though by the time they reached the office<br/>Usagi had a new and they were all laughing. If Usagi was anything, she was a<br/>total klutz, and her tripping over the janitors a second time on the way<br/>down was just to much. They all got another ear full of Chinese cussing<br/>again, though this time it was in exasperation.<p>When they arrived at the nurses office, Ranma was a bit surprised when the<br/>nurse actually knew Usagi on sight. She gave them all suckers for some<br/>reason, wrapped the injured girl's foot and pushed them all out of the room<br/>for those that actually needed it. The rest of the day was pretty quiet,<br/>then lunch hit and the mood of the school changed, the excited squealing of<br/>a large pack of girls turned the lunch room into a spectacle. While getting<br/>ready to head down to see what was going on, Umino the class geek and<br/>resident spy cornered her before she could leave the class room. Ranma<br/>briefly considered pounding him, but decided to see what he wanted, it<br/>usually was something of interest. "Ranma."<p>"What's up Umino?"<p>"There is a girl at a high school looking for information on you."<p>"Oh? Which school would that be?"<p>"Furinkan High in the Nerima district."<p>"Why are you telling me this, you usually keep to yourself."<p>"She was asking weird questions about a male Ranma Saotome, is he your<br/>brother or something? Ranma isn't all that of a common name you now, ever<br/>heard of him?"<p>Ranma paled. "A male Ranma? G-got me on that one, I'm an only child as far<br/>as I know."<p>Umino leaned in close and hmmm'ed in a geeky way, giving her a weird look.<br/>"Are you sure your an only child, she's offering a reward for information on<br/>this male Ranma."<p>"Why would she be doing that?"<p>"The information is important in some way, it's the way these things are<br/>done."<p>"Well I have no idea what's going on." Ranma said, starting to sweat.<p>"I'll let her know. Thanks." Umino said and vanished as quickly as he had<br/>appeared.<p>Ranma sighed and dashed out of the room, her curiosity getting the better<br/>of her, the thing in the lunch room and Umino taking up much of her mind.<br/>She shrugged, it wasn't like she hadn't expected someone to start looking<br/>for her eventually. Though she had thought it would be her mother, not some<br/>stranger in a school she had never heard of before. She decided to look into<br/>it later, right now she had squealing girls to deal with. As she approached<br/>the lunch room she saw that a number of boys clustered around the doors and<br/>watching. She tapped on the shoulder.<p>"What's going on?"<p>"You don't know?"<p>"I'm out of the loop still."<p>"Right, there holding a contest to give out two tickets to this cruise that<br/>is leaving port in a week or so. All the girls are in there trying to win<br/>the tickets."<p>"A cruise...that means the ocean, a great place to train in some of my more<br/>exotic techniques like the Shark Fist and some others, if not that then<br/>there would always be a pool..." Ranma rambled out.<p>The boys all sweat dropped and backed away as Ranma ran into the room and<br/>hopped in line. Ten minutes later Ranma grinned and held up two tickets to<br/>the cruise excitedly, forty other girl's were glaring daggers of death at<br/>her. Usagi and Molly were disappointed, but congratulated Ranma on her win<br/>and trudged away looking depressed. Ranma was lost in her dreams of fighting<br/>under water battles against monsters and water demons, when she felt some<br/>eyes on her and looked around. She spotted Ito and Luna sitting on the<br/>window sill to the lunch room, glaring at her in some irritating way. The<br/>rest of the girls in the room saw Ranma look at something and smirk, they<br/>turned and sighed.<p>"Their so kawaii!" Forty girl's yelled and rushed over to look at the<br/>cats.<p>"I've never seen a red cat that cute before!"<p>"Look at those crescent birth marks, they must be related!"<p>"There so cute!"<p>Ranma took the opportunity to leave the lunch room just as the bell rang,<br/>she was back in class a few minutes later looking at her prize. She froze<br/>and blushed as she realized what had happened, the words LOVE CRUISE FOR TWO<br/>were easily read across both tickets, leave it to a bunch of girls to get<br/>her hopes up over something stupid. Oh well, she could give the tickets away<br/>or use one and bring along a friend...wait she didn't have all that many<br/>friends and they were all a little strange. She's have to think about...oh<br/>yeah, that girl that was looking for information on a male Ranma Saotome.<br/>She would have to look into that and see what was going on.<p>**********<p>After school Ranma met Ito and Luna in the park to see what they had<br/>wanted. The instant Ranma spotted them she started to giggle and was clawed<br/>into silence by Luna. The both of them looked like they had just gotten<br/>mugged by a pack of crazed girls with a bow fetish obsession. There are bows<br/>along their tails, on their feet, around their necks, stomachs, even between<br/>their ears. Both cats were pissed and putting out visible battle auras as<br/>they paced back and forth like caged tigers, muttering under their breath<br/>about girls and bows and revenge.<p>"Not one WORD Ranma!" Ito snarled.<p>"Those girl's were crazed out of their minds!" Luna whined.<p>Ranma kept her giggles down to a minimum as she took the bows off the two<br/>cats. She did have to resist an urge to run thought, but found that it was<br/>in fact quite easy to do. Weird. Still she was careful, she didn't either<br/>cat attacking her for saying something stupid. "What did you two want<br/>anyway."<p>"We just wanted you to know that we are at your service from now on, you<br/>are the Princess."<p>"Not that crap again!" Ranma snapped.<p>"But you are the Princess, the crescent moon on your head is all the proof<br/>I need." Luna said.<p>"Wake up Luna, I couldn't be a princess if I wanted to be, which I don't by<br/>the way, so just back off."<p>"No, we need to find your transformation broach so you can become a scout."<p>"What's that?" Ranma asked.<p>"It's a device that allows you to use your magic to fight with, give you a<br/>Scout uniform, and a disguise field so no one can recognized you when you<br/>fight."<p>"Hey, isn't that..." Ito stated.<p>"Luna, you guys don't talk to each other to much do you?" Ranma said.<p>Ito nodded and smirked, looking over at Luna. "Lady Pluto already gave<br/>Ranma her powers, she's already a Scout."<p>"WHAT?" Luna screamed and fell over. "Pluto hasn't been seen in<br/>centuries Ito, she is dead or something worse."<p>"Pluto is still around, she just has to follow different rules than us. You<br/>should remember that."<p>"Ranma show me, I want to see you transform into your Scout form. What<br/>planet do you represent anyway?"<p>Ranma sighed and held up her arms to show off her golden arm bracers, and<br/>Luna wondered why she hadn't noticed them before. "Pluto originally gave me<br/>a pen of some kind, it was kind of dumb looking though. Then when I touched<br/>it the thing turned to light and turned into these bracers, there is some<br/>kind of spell on them that makes others ignore them in some way. Pluto said<br/>I represented the Sun, Sailor Flash or something like that."<p>"Sailor Sol, Ranma, Sailor Sol." Ito muttered.<p>"Um...right, like I'm going to call myself something gay like that. I'll<br/>come up with something better later."<p>"You can't just change your Sailor name Ranma, Its...its..."<p>"Gay sounding is what it is, at least the suit is a minor improvement over<br/>the other's suits. Though not by much."<p>"I want to see it!" Luna yelled.<p>"Why?"<p>"Please?" Ito asked, slightly curious herself.<p>Ranma sighed and headed deeper into the trees nearby to get some privacy,<br/>when she was deep enough that she couldn't see anyone, she held up the<br/>bracers and shouted. "SOL CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!" There was a bright flash<br/>of light, the cats later swore they head a loud moan of pleasure, and Sailor<br/>Sol stood there in her all her glory looking great and slightly flushed. She<br/>had a green breast bow and white back bow that had a pair of ribbons<br/>trailing to the floor, the wave of power wafting off Sol was almost enough<br/>to blow the cats off there feet.<p>"Incredible!" Luna yelled.<p>"That's awesome Sailor Sol!" Ito yelled out.<p>"Don't call me that!" Ranma snapped out and formed a bladed staff made of<br/>KI and Magic and leveled it at the cats. "I will be taking another name, got<br/>that?"<p>"Whatever you want Princess." The cats chorused and sweat dropped.<p>"Exactly, now what did you two want to talk about before we got<br/>sidetracked."<p>"Two things, we want you to train with your new powers and to meet with the<br/>other Scouts. Ito here tells me your already a powerful martial artist and<br/>from what I've seen I believe her. We would also like to discus the<br/>possibility of you training the Scouts to be better fighters, their so green<br/>it's pathetic."<p>"I saw them fight that robotic princess the other day Luna, your right,<br/>their pathetic, but good enough to be dangerous to others. I'll look into<br/>it."<p>"Well you meet with them?"<p>"I haven't met them formally Luna, but I already know who Moon, Mars, and<br/>Mercury are."<p>"What? How can that be, they've been so careful to keep it a secret."<p>Ranma smirked. "I witnessed Ami transform, the rest was easy to figure out,<br/>after all they are always hanging out together."<p>Luna moaned.<p>"Don't worry about it, I don't think anyone else noticed what I did."<p>"Well, I'm still going to have a little talk with those girls and get them<br/>to be more careful." Luna muttered.<p>Ranma shrugged. "Whatever." She did think it was a good time to get some<br/>practice though, but in the middle of the park was a bad idea. She had a<br/>funny feeling, and Pluto telling her so, that she could level entire blocks<br/>if she wanted to. That kind of power was very dangerous, oh yes, she was<br/>going to need to do some training. "Hey Luna, you are right that I need<br/>training with this power. Where do the others go to train and fire off<br/>random blasts of destruction?"<p>Luna sweat dropped.<p>**********<p>Hey everyone I need ideas on Ranma's new Scout name, send me some ideas.<br/>Please ^^
