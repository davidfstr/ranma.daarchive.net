</div>Notes - It has been a while hasn't it? Well this is then next chapter and it finishes up the last chapter and introduces Nodoka as a main character to the story. It took a while to get this chapter done because I had to almost completely rewrite Nodoka's character and get White Phoenix's permission to use an idea of his and develop it from there. I left things a little vague in purpose and they will be explained in future chapters.<p>Princess of the Moon<br/>Chapter 06<br/>By Cory D. Rose<p>(c)2002<p>Dealing with Nabiki had been an experience for Ranma, she was very good at getting her to do what she wanted. Coming to Nerima was about the last thing she wanted to do, but the girl had turned on that super cute puppy eyed look for some reason and crushed all of Ranma's resistance. Ranma cursed herself for a fool for giving in too, she had decided that after talking with Ito for a little while that staying in Jubaan was a better idea. So she had waited until the girl got out of the bathroom and told her that she had decided not to go.<p>Then Nabiki had tried to bribe her with a new dress or manga, whatever interested her if she would come. Ranma refused, she wasn't that easy to bribe, the Amazon's had tried it on several occasions as well. She had more than a enough pride left not to fall for that kind of thing again. Then Nabiki had tried to use reason and Ranma dug her heels in and refused even more. Then came that damned technique that always worked, the tears and big innocent eyes that must have shattered her will like a sledge hammer and melted her mind until she was babbling anything to make the girl feel better. Ranma wanted to scream, that one always got her to cave in no matter how hard she tried to not be affected. Shampoo and the other Amazon girls had discovered this and used it to make her do things that had been just plain weird. So with a sigh she had given in, again, but by that time it was nearly midnight, much to late for Nabiki to be walking the streets so she had spent the night in Ranma's room. After a quick call home to let her sisters know where she was, Nabiki was given the bed while Ranma curled up on the floor in her sleeping bag.<p>The next morning had been a bit odd to sat the least, Nabiki had wanted to get up early to make it to Nerima as soon as possible. They had forgotten to take into account one little fact, neither of them were morning people and when the alarm clock went off at five the next morning, it's short life came to and end as Ranma crushed it and tossed out the window into the bushes. They ended finally got up an hour later as Ranma's years on the road woke her up at dawn for what would have been a morning sparing match with the old man. Instead she had shake herself to remember what was going on, spent twenty minutes waking up a dead to the world Nabiki, and went out to train while she took a bath. After that Ranma had gotten cleaned up and they had caught the but to Nerima.<p>Nerima wasn't what Ranma had expected either as they got off the bus the next morning at eight, luckily it was a Sunday and they didn't need to worry about school. She looked around and stared at all the different dojo's they walked passed. There were dojo's everywhere, one or two per block at times, they seemed to be everywhere. Ranma had never seen so many in one small an area of a large city like Tokyo, to her knowledge most dojo's tended to hold large areas of land that they supported and defended with brutal efficiency. A bit of curiosity made her wonder how such a district could have come about, the odds of so many different schools being in one place had to be nearly impossible.<p>Ranma's pack was weighing her down today, it had been nearly three months since she last carried the thing around like this. She was a bit surprised to not that she had already lost her body hardening from the heavy thing. She rolled her shoulders and adjusted the weight of her pack as they moved across a busy intersection, Nerima seemed to be a mix of both old and modern society in Ranma's estimation, what a strange place. Most of the land that supported dojo's also seemed to have an old ancestral family homes built right next to them, it was just the weirdest thing she had ever seen. Even the business seemed to be designed to support the increased martial artists in the area, walls were reinforced and streets were designed with an easily replaceable material.<p>Nabiki pointed all this out to her as they walked, pointing out something new and interesting every block or two as they passed by. Ranma, if she had known Nabiki a little better, would have been a little disturbed to find out that she was doing this tour for free. A strange and rare thing for Nabiki Tendo, the Ice Queen of Furinkan and all around Mercenary to the core. According to Nabiki, this entire district was dedicated to those families that were martial artists and decedents of the Samurai families like the Kuno and Takahashi families that at one time ruled the entire area.<p>She explained the strange set up too, it seemed that at one time there had been a war in the area. One of the ruling families had decided that they wanted to know about or use all the different types of martial arts in the world and invited all the warrior families to live in the area and practice or teach as much as they wanted. Over time all these school, who moved here for the low rent and multiple challenges, had grown into a steadily growing district and proven that they could actually live and work with each other. Nabiki even told him that the district counsel had set up a number of empty lots through out the area as places where martial artists could train and fight. At first these lots had been clean and very usable for that very purpose, but over the years they had become over grown and unused and were now just empty lots that got little or no use.<p>"This is Furinkan High School where me and my sister Akane go to school." Nabiki said as she pointed out the school to Ranma.<p>"What's with the all the holes in the walls along the entrance?"<p>"The Kuno family is a little...insane, a Tatawaki Kuno goes to school here and has declared that if any of the boys in school wants to date my sister Akane they have to defeat her in combat, so him and a number of boys have a battle most mornings. The damage is from where the boys end up when my sister kicks or punches them through the walls to relieve her anger at the whole stupid situation."<p>"I take it these Kuno's are total idiots?"<p>"Completely, but good for a quick buck if one plays them just right."<p>"What, you cheat them?" Ranma asked, raising her eyebrow.<p>"Nope, I just charge him for information. I make money off bets and selling information, I use it to help support my family."<p>"Why would you need to do that?" Ranma asked curiously, this Tendo family seemed to be just one surprise after another.<p>"Um..." Nabiki said, why the hell had she told Ranma that? It was one of the few things she didn't like to tell anyone, it could ruin her reputation at school if anyone heard or used it against her. Then she shrugged, for some reason she wanted to Ranma to know the truth. "Well, our father was...devastated when our mother died and he stopped teaching and the money stopped coming in. Me and my sisters had to take up the slack of keeping the family going."<p>"Oh?" Ranma said as they tuned a corner to walk the last few blocks to the Tendo Dojo and accidentally runs into someone as they came out of nowhere. They both go down in a pile, Ranma giving out a girly shriek of surprise as she went down, someone heavy landed on top of her. Ranma groaned and blushed at the unmanly reaction and sat up to see a boy wearing a bandanna sitting up to look at her. His eyes tripled in size and he turns bright red for a few seconds, then the most amazing thing happens.<p>"Oh hi Ryoga..." Nabiki starts.<p>Ryoga's eyes rolled back and blood exploded out of his nose and all over his shirt as he falls over in a dead faint. Ranma and Nabiki blinked and gagged in disgust at the sight, though Ranma has learned enough of her affect on men to know that she was the cause of this, she just didn't know what she had done, this time, to make the poor boy just pass out like that. Ranma looked down at herself, nothing was out of place and since she wore double layers of clothing with her normal out fit nothing perverted was showing.<p>"Is this normal for him?" Ranma asked as she flipped her long braid over her shoulder.<p>"I have no idea, I've never seen him as a man before, I only recognized him because of that pack and the bandanna. I've only met him while he was in female form and that was a few days ago when my sister dragged him home."<p>"...so round...so firm...oh...my god...heheheheh..." Ryoga mumbled in his sleep and giggling lecherously.<p>"Well, that explains that, he's a pervert though and through." Ranma said as she stood up and glared at the boy. She had found out first hand just what a pervert was while she traveled across China challenging various fighters. She'd found that she had to fight most of the male fighters two or three times because they always thought she was a weak girl, the only way make sure this didn't happen was to hit them so hard that they shattered walls and took out trees with their flying bodies. This seemed to make them rethink that assessment that all girs were weak mentally and physically. They usually spent more time during the fights and watching from the sidelines looking at her tits than what they were doing and got pounded for it. Ranma didn't hold back all that much when she fought anymore, it just made everyone think she was weak.<p>"No kidding, he better be careful of my sister, she has a dislike for anything male that even gives a suggestion of perversion."<p>"Poor guy, he needs to get some better luck. He was always obsessed with finding his way home, a family curse if I remember right, he could spend weeks away from home looking for it. Back in school he used to arrive at school for a few days, sleeping in a tent near the front door to the school, then go and get lost for a few weeks before show up again for a few days. Eventually we had to walk him to and from school just so he could get an education even a bad education."<p>"You went to school with him?" Nabiki said, looking Ranma up and down.<p>"Yeah, it was an all boys school and pretty rough to. Me and Ryoga tended to get into two or three fights a day during the six months I was in the area. It was the most fun I had during the entire stay there, the guy has a lot of brute strength."<p>Ryoga suddenly groaned and sat up holding his head. "What happened?"<p>"You took one look at my magnificence and passed out." Ranma said and took a model like pose that showed off her chest while she tried to look as innocent as she could.<p>Nabiki snickered and started at her own reaction.<p>Ryoga looked up and paled again, but this time Ranma's hand shot out and grabbed him by the nose. This kept him from passing out again, though he started to giggle nervously and rub the back of his head, his eyes were a little glassy as well. Nabiki remembered Ranma doing that while she was talking to her at the temple, it certainly made this Ryoga really cute in a bashful kind of way.<p>"What are you doing out here Ryoga, are you having dinner at my place tonight?"<p>Ryoga giggled some more and blushed as he stood up, holding his own nose. "Um, yeah...I was just at the house went to use the bathroom and ended up outside for some reason, I don't even remember leaving the property. I know it has to be around her somewhere, I'm just not sure where."<p>Ranma nodded, that was just how she remembered the idiot.<p>"Well lets get you back to the house, Akane is probably beginning to worry about you by now. How long has it been since you left?"<p>"Um...about half an hour."<p>"Well come on, were headed there too." Ranma said and grabbed Ryoga by his elbow and started to drag him along. The Lost Boy turned a solid read and started to mumble to himself as they moved along. Ranma had to let go when he started to get a nose bleed again, what in the hell was causing that? A few minutes later they were standing in front of the Tendo Dojo, it was about like most of the other houses in the area. A large family house with a larger dojo just out back with a good sized back yard and a koi pond. They opened the front gate and made their way inside just as the front door of the house opened and a cute girl in a dress and apron stepped out to greet them.<p>"Oh hello Nabiki I see you brought home some guests. Ryoga, where have you been, Akane was worried about you."<p>He lowered his head. "Sorry about that Kasumi, I got lost..."<p>Another girl came barreling out of the house and latched onto the Lost Boy's arm, she was a little shorter than he was, had long blue/black hair and carried herself as a martial artist Ranma noted. She smiled at the boy and started to drag him back into the house, but stopped as she noticed her sisters and Ranma. "Who?"<p>"Call me Ranma Mazaki, you must be Akane, your sister here told me about you."<p>"Akane Tendo."<p>"Akane, this is the panda's son, the one that he turned into a girl when he knocked him into on of those springs at Jusenkyo."<p>"So he is just like Ryoga?"<p>Ryoga gaped then narrowed his eyes at Ranma, maybe this wasn't his angel. It must be a demon in disguise, he would have to find out the truth, but if it was Ranma...<p>"No, pops turned me into a girl permanently. I left him when he disowned me while I was staying at the Amazon Village just outside Jusenkyo." Ranma explained quickly.<p>"Ranma is that you?" Ryoga said quietly, his rage starting to grow just behind his eyes. He clenched his fists and growled.<p>"Hi Ryoga, it has been a long time. About three years if I remember correctly."<p>Ryoga snarled in rage and his world turned red, he screamed rushed forward in a blur that none of the girls could even see and decked Ranma across the jaw so hard that she went flying back into the wall. She slumped down, then rolled to her feet and growled at Ryoga. "You had better have a damned good reason for doing that Ryoga."<p>"Why weren't you there at the appointed time Ranma!"<p>"The fight? It was 'appointed' to be Friday afternoon Ryoga, I waited for you to show until Monday morning on account of your problem with getting anywhere."<p>"You broke a promise between men Ranma..."<p>"I did no such thing you moron, I waited three days for you to show up Ryoga. Why weren't you there on time, it was a challenge match after all."<p>"Do you think I was wandering around Japan for my health?"<p>"You set the time and place for the match Ryoga, you're the one that didn't show up."<p>"Because of you I've seen hell and lost three years of my life Ranma. I'm going to kill you for that!" Ryoga pulls an umbrella from out of nowhere and charges Ranma with a massive a swing. Ranma drops and rolls out of the way as Ryoga's swing impacted the gate and blew it clean off it's hinges, reducing it to firewood. The sound of the decimated gate echo's across the block as the Lost Boy turns towards his enemy seeing nothing but a red haze of anger and depression.<p>"Ryoga calm down and think about what you're doing!" Ranma yells as she motions for the Tendo girls rush into the house to get out of the way.<p>"Ranma be careful." Nabiki yelled as they all ran inside, but Akane and Kasumi were giving Nabiki a weird look.<p>"I showed up on the fourth day and you had ran like the coward you are Ranma, I followed all the way to China and will continue to go even further to make you pay for my suffering! DIE YOU BASTARD!" Ryoga yelled and swung at Ranma again, but this time Ranma hopped upwards, landing on Ryoga's umbrella and kicked him in the face, then back flipped off of the strange weapon and landed in a crouch a few feet from the boy. Then spun around and swept the boys feet out jus as she stiff armed him in the chest, sending him flying back with a grunt of pain.<p>"Calm down Ryoga, you don't know..."<p>"DIE!" Ryoga yelled when he had caught his balance, pulled a number of bandana's off his head, and suddenly tossed out dozens of spinning bandanna's that Ranma dodged and weaved around with ease. Ryoga ran forward and tossed his umbrella like a spear, but it was dodged just easily, though it did tear a hole in the side of the house when it hit. As Ranma dodged, Ryoga managed to grab onto her ankle and hefted Ranma above his head single handedly and slammed her down into the ground to create a crater in the ground. Ryoga did this a couple of times before Ranma was able to pull herself back together and retaliate. She rode a swing and waited for Ryoga to slam her against the ground again before kicking him in the wrist and rolling away when he clutched his hand in pain.<p>Ranma grunted in pain and could tell that her left arm was dislocated as she rolled to her feet and glared at the Lost Boy. She grabbed it and with a loud crunch that everyone in the house heard, reset it just as she exploded in an aura of blue power. Around her the dust and rocks started to lift off the ground and fill the air around Ranma. Ryoga, not expecting this kind of retaliation, backed up and wondered if he had made a mistake. Then Ranma screamed and a crescent moon appeared on her forehead and her aura turned a bright silver. Her blue eyes lit up and started to glow with power as she glared at Ryoga. Then she vanished in the blink of an eyes and a sonic boom rolled over the area. Ryoga desperately looked around with his eyes and senses, but there was no sign of Ranma or where she had gone.<p>Then his world exploded in pain as Ranma appeared, her fist planted in his stomach as he slowly bent over from the shock of the blow. Then his day got worse as Ranma started to flicker in and out of sight all around him, punching and kicking faster than he could defend himself, until finally Ryoga found himself lifted off the ground by his throat with Ranma's pissed off silver eyes glaring into his own and he knew he was finished. "Ryoga, I have some news for you, I have changed since I was permanently changed into this body and no matter how much you'd like to beat on me or blame me for your problems, I will never allow you to hurt me for your own personal delusions." Ranma said in a whisper that scared Ryoga so much he almost pissed himself.<p>His senses were telling him that there was a super powered monster standing in front of him that he had ticked off. Then he started to gasp for air as Ranma tightened her fingers around his windpipe and nearly crushed his throat. "This was our duel Ryoga, it is finished and I expect you to honor it as if it had happened years ago. I don't have time to put up with this kind of crap, not from you or anyone else. Do you understand me?" Ranma snarled.<p>Ryoga gasped for air and nodded franticly. This wasn't the Ranma he remembered, the one that irritated him to no end, the one that insulted and mocked him day after day, the bread stealer or the one that destroyed the reputation that he had spent years developing to keep others from making fun of him and his family curse. This was a fighter of unmatched skill that Ranma had only been a glimpse of in those days, this was a monster that could crush him with a single finger and not even break a nail.<p>"Excellent. If you had attacked me when I was still a man, we might have been more even in our skills Ryoga, but this change came with powers that I'm just scraping the surface of and I don't have time to be playing with you over a stupid bread feud." Ranma said as she dropped Ryoga and stepped back. She flared her aura up several more times what it was just to let Ryoga know she was still holding back and stalked towards the front gate. She wanted nothing to do with this place if this what she had to deal with. She hadn't wanted to come here anyway so to come here again would never happen.<p>"Ryoga, are you alright?" Akane yelled as she rushed outside and started to examine Ryoga and was surprised to find that he had no broken bones, just lots of bruises. Still this was Akane and she just didn't know when she was outclassed and rounded on Ranma as she walked to the front gate. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"<p>Stopping, Ranma turned around and looked at the girl. "Protecting myself, he did attack me with lethal intent. I learned my lessons from the Amazons in China, never let an enemy like him go unless they know what you're capable of doing."<p>"I won't just sit back and let you beat up my friends!" Akane yelled and took up a defensive stance.<p>Ranma smirked and noticed Nabiki step out onto the porch and take in the situation, she rolled her eyes. "Akane stop this, you can't take Ranma in a fight."<p>"I'm the best Martial Artist in Nerima, I can beat anybody." Akane snarled.<p>"The best, Hah, you don't even know how to use your Ki yet. Even Ryoga can do that, but I never gave him a chance to use it, or your house would have been destroyed in the blast. How can you defend against that when you don't even know how to use little girl?" Ranma said just as an older man in a brown gi and Kasumi stepped up beside Nabiki. He had his hands behind his back as if contemplating something. Kasumi just looked worried and scared, she didn't understand quite what was going on.<p>The man turned to look at Akane and sighed, then looked over at Ranma and paled a little. "Are you, like my daughter has told me, Ranma Saotome?"<p>"Ranma Saotome died in China when his father disowned him publicly, after all Ranma was a man and I can't be that anymore."<p>"So you used to be Ranma Saotome?"<p>"Yes, I'm Ranma Mazaki now."<p>"Are you going to wait for your father to come back here in a little while, he went out on an errand for my other daughter Kasumi. Also what are you going to do about the promise between our families, the schools must be united?"<p>"Don't ignore me!" Akane screamed and launched forward.<p>To Ranma, who had battled against the Scouts, several Youma, and some super fast Amazons she was so easy to read it was pathetic. Still, Ranma had learned her lesson about mocking weaker opponents, having been on the receiving end of a lot of it while with the Amazons. Stepping back Ranma took up an open stance and calmly blocked all of Akane's punches. That didn't mean she wouldn't make an opponent mess up by insulting them into a blind rage though.<p>"Don't over extend your punch, it places you off balance."<p>"Point your toes where you want to punch, it adds power to the attack."<p>Ranma's hand flashed out and tapped Akane in the head, chest, and stomach, then lightly kicked the girl half way across the yard. Staying in position, Ranma slowly brought her leg up even higher and did a standing split that had Nabiki blushing. She wondered why it was getting so warm suddenly. "Finally, you need to work on your defense, as demonstrated by the taps I did while you attacked me Miss. Tendo."<p>"You Pervert!" Akane screamed and jumped forward, a Ki mallet appearing in her hands.<p>Ranma just shook her head and wondered who had taught this girl how to fight, she was making novice mistakes. Channeling a bit of Ki to her foot Ranma snap kicked the mallet and popped it like a bubble, then punched Akane in the head. She collapsed next to the frightened Ryoga, who held her protectively, glaring at Ranma, but she ignored him as if he wasn't worth it.<p>"Mr. Tendo, the only thing I'm going to do with pop is beat him up when I see him. This whole situation is his fault anyway, he took us to Jusenkyo and got both of us cursed. As for the promise, well are any of your daughters lesbians?"<p>"W-what?" Soun said, suddenly blushing.<p>"Are any of them lesbians, my body is female, but my mind is still male and that means I like girls. Two girls can not marry and since my curse isn't reversible like Mr. Directionally Challenged here, I can't marry any of them anyway. Sure we could make a couple if they were interested, but I doubt any of them are." Ranma said, noting the red faced Nabiki smiling at her, she waved shyly, Ranma began to sweat nervously and backed up a few steps and bumped into something.<p>"Groghf!"<p>Ranma turned around and jumped back as she spotted her idiot father, in panda form and smirked at him. "Hey old fart, care to have a 'little' talk about what you did in China?" Ranma said and cracked her knuckles.<p>*What are you doing here, you are no longer welcome around me or my friends.* Said the panda's sign.<p>"Oh please, like you ever cared what I did before old man."<p>*Leave, or I will take you down permanently.*<p>"You don't have the power old man."<p>*Kasumi, can you get me some hot water, I have to take care of this Ronin.*<p>"Of course Mr. Saotome." Kasumi said happily and went into the kitchen.<p>A few minutes later a now human Genma Saotome was glaring at his ex-son, the traitor that refused to change back to a man. "Explain something to me boy, why did you give up your manhood?"<p>Ranma blinked. "What in the hell are you talking about you old fool, I didn't 'give up' my manhood. The transformation was permanent, you were there when the guide told us that, you were there when he poured gallons of hot water over my head and I failed to change back."<p>"I recall no such thing."<p>Ranma just shrugged. "Kasumi, is there any hot water left in that kettle?"<p>"Oh yes."<p>"Pour it over me would you, it seems the idiot here has a selective memory when it comes to his mistakes."<p>The water poured over Ranma as Kasumi tilted the kettle, but the change didn't happen and Genma backed up several steps. "What the hell did you do to make it permanent like that, you did it intentionally!"<p>"Moron, you knocked me into a permanent spring. Just like you made Ryoga there trip into a spring when you were trying to bash him in the head. Why would you do such a thing old man, is there more to this stupid marriage that you haven't explained to me?"<p>"Shut up 'GIRL' you are no son of mine while in that form! When you go back to being a man I will acknowledge you again, but until then you have no family, no name, nothing!" Genma snarled.<p>"It looks like you want to take another flight over the surrounding country pop, come on now, let me give you a hand."<p>Nabiki was confused, Mr. Saotome seemed to have forgotten everything he had told her when she set out to find his son. Sure he was now female, but that wasn't any reason to act like this to one's own child. Even as the 'Ice Queen' she knew this and took measures to make sure she never hurt a child with her dealings. Then there was her father, he was acting strange too, almost like he used to before mother died. He usually cried at the drop of a hat, or wailed at his daughters being in danger, this was different...it was almost like he had a plan in mind. Then Mr. Saotome took a stance and she saw her father shift as well and Nabiki's eyes widened. Her father had the family honor blade in his hand, it's bindings removed.<p>"Wha..." The two fools were going to try and force Ranma into something, but how would they know she was going to be here?<p>"Now Tendo!" Genma yelled and flared up in a yellow aura and launched himself at Ranma.<p>Ranma just shook her head and shifted to block her old man, but was caught off guard as Mr. Tendo jumped at her as well. He had a blade in his hand as he pulled it from it's sheath, it was an attack she hadn't anticipated on. So she did the one thing the old fart wouldn't expect, he was used to dealing with his son, not the girl that had taken his place because of the permanent change of gender. Ever since the change her tactics had changed when it came to fighting, the Amazons had helped as well. Ranma leapt for the ceiling and watched as her pop's face go white as Mr. Tendo tried to alter the course of his cut and had to twist the sword in his hand so that the flat of the blade smacked down on the back of Genma's shoulders and drew a little blood.<p>Dropping down Ranma kicked Mr. Tendo in the head and sent him flying into a wall, flipped and came up under her father and uppercut him. It lifted the old man off the floor and left him open for kick that Ranma was more than willing to do. The kick to Genma's side sent him flying into the back yard and landed in the koi pond with a massive splash that swamped Ryoga and the still unconscious Akane. Ranma smirked as she saw Akane wake up in the arms of Ryoga's female form.<p>"PERVERT!" Akane screamed and slapped Ryoga.<p>"Just like I thought, you were just going to use me just like you always have, weren't you pops? Did you sell me to the Tendo's like you did so many times before?"<p>"Groan..."<p>Ranma just shook her head and crossed her arms. "Would you believe I showed up here today to possibly make up with you and see how things could go between us? Nabiki here talked me into it, I figured that since you were my father that we could talk things out and have a little peace between us. Instead I find you freeloading off this family and end up getting attacked by you, an old friend of mine, and some girl I've never met."<p>"Groph."<p>"I'm out of here." Ranma said and stalked out of the yard, she would let them deal with all the damage Ryoga had caused.<p>After several minutes she stepped walking and entered a park and made her way over to a fountain. She shrugged off her pack and rubbed her shoulders since she hadn't even had time to take the thing off before she was attacked. The sound of the fountain was a comforting sight and something she needed right then, she hadn't wanted to mention it to anyone, but she was feeling weird too. That fight had been like rubbing salt in an old wound, her abilities had been acting or feeling a little weird lately. Ranma looked at her hands and went over the fight in her mind, the attack by Ryoga had been a surprise to say the least but nothing she couldn't handle.<p>She had expected it from her father, but not Mr. Tendo, had someone told the old farts that she would be there today? Would Nabiki had done something like that for some odd reason? Then there was that other girl, Akane Tendo, she had potential to be a great fighter, but it seemed that no one had ever bothered to teach her the true meaning of Martial Arts. The defense of others, the control of one's own emotions and body, and the ability to control every aspect of a fight.<p>Instead the girl seemed to have a lot of strength, but no control over her actions. She was predictable and too set in one style that she had lost the skills that were the very core of Anything Goes. The unpredictability of the art, the ability to move from one style to another without the usual consequences this usually caused. Then there was that other thing that was bothering her, how she had reacted to the fight in the first place. She had nearly lost control of herself, a fatal mistake if it had happened.<p>Ever since Jusenkyo she had known she was a lot more powerful than she had been, her Ki had grown almost exponentially for a few months there. Cologne and several other teachers had taught her how to focus all this power she had gained, but as time went on her control was slipping for some reason. She hadn't really noticed it till now though, what was happening to her? Why was she loosing her control over her new abilities, the ones she had thought were so firmly under her control? In the past she would learn a new technique and once she had it down it just became easier and easier to do until she mastered it completely and incorporated it into her style.<p>Surprisingly enough her Ki abilities were not the problem, they were working perfectly, the power never once wavered in the slightest. It was her other powers she was worried about, her magic, what she had gained when she was first transformed into a girl, she clearly remembered drop kicking her idiot father clear out of the valley without much trouble. Later when took up being that stupid Sailor Sun identity her magical power had grown even more. The stuff was unpredictable at times and seemed to have a mind of it's own, there were times when she had used it in fights that it seemed to hesitate before anything happened. At the time she hadn't thought much out of it, but now she wondered if she should have paid more attention.<p>"Ranma?"<p>She turned and noticed Nabiki giving her a worried look, Ranma sighed and nodded at the girl. "Hi Nabiki, what's up?"<p>"I'm sorry about what happened back there."<p>"Don't worry about it, some good may have come out of it."<p>"Like what?"<p>"I nearly lost control of one of my special abilities back there, one I had thought I had down. Instead I'm finding it harder and harder to control, I hadn't really noticed until I had to fight everyone at the compound there. I was just standing here trying to find a way to get that control back."<p>"What have you come up with?"<p>"Nothing yet, just going over what happened when I lost control of it. It only lasted a split second, but this has me worried about using the ability any time in the near future unless it is an emergency."<p>"You could always talk to Dr. Tofu."<p>"A Doctor, how would he be able to help with a magic control problem?"<p>"Magic?" Nabiki gasped, little dollar signs in her eyes.<p>"Yeah, it was part of what I gained when I landed in that spring. I lost my manhood, but gained a lot of power in it's place. Power is a pretty cool thing to have, but sometimes the cost is more than what one is willing to pay. I would be willing to give all of this up to be a man again, but that is impossible at the moment."<p>"Why is that Ranma?"<p>"The pools of Jusenkyo are a curse, something that is given as a punishment. A curse can not be used to cure a curse, the damned things mix together to make the punishment worse."<p>Nabiki paled as the thought of a half man, half woman that Ranma could have become if she were to jump into a spring of drowned man. "That's horrible!"<p>"I know, I lost my manhood in that spring, I don't want to be even more of a freak as I am right now. I'm strange enough as it its."<p>"I like you as you are Ranma and don't think you're all that strange, my family has always been a little strange too, you should see my father and Akane when they are being normal."<p>"What was up with them anyway, I didn't do anything to even provoke any of those attacks. The one with Akane was, maybe a little warranted because of what I did to Ryoga, but she was jumping to all kinds of strange conclusions and attacked me. Why?"<p>Nabiki sighed. "Akane has to fight off all those boys every morning, she has a dislike of anything male, and Kuno has only worked to make the situation much worse than it had to be. I don't know what she sees in Ryoga, but with most boys she gives them the cold shoulder, insults them, or beats them up when they show even the slightest interest in her. That only fuels the interest in her at school and around the area, she is also `Daddy's Little Princess' and gets pretty much what she wants."<p>"Spoiled then." Ranma said as if that said it all, it wasn't even a question in her mind.<p>"No, its more like she is over confident and out of control since Daddy won't curtail her actions. She was also a little mad at you because you were supposed to be her new fiancee, she is the heir to the Tendo School after all."<p>"I don't like her attitude very much, she needs to be brought down a few pegs. Just like I was forced to do by a teacher of mine."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"I grew up on the road Nabiki, battling my father day in and day out, from early morning to late at night. He was the only human contact I ever had for months on end as we traveled, I was rude, arrogant, and uneducated. The Amazons beat a good number of those things out of me and forced me to learn and think instead just reacting to the situation like I was used to doing with pop. It was a painful lesson, took me weeks to recover my pride and self confidence again, but when I did I was ten times more powerful since I could think my way through a battle instead of just reacting to it on an instinctive level."<p>"You must have been quite a jock before the change."<p>"Not really, a jock is someone that has to...okay that does apply to me." Ranma said and blushed. Nabiki just smirked and nodded.<p>"Well lets get you over to Dr. Tofu..."<p>"Nabiki, you do realize that it is a little early in the morning, I bet he hasn't even opened up just yet."<p>"What...Oh, nope I never even considered the time, it isn't even seven is it? I guess we'll have to do it some other time then. Maybe later today or tomorrow."<p>"Maybe."<p>"So what are you going to do now?"<p>"Head back to Jubaan I guess, there is no reason to stay around here anymore."<p>"I'm sorry." Nabiki said.<p>"It's not your fault, I had hoped things would work out too."<p>"I'll walk you to the bus station then and see you off."<p>"Naw, I'll walk back and save some money."<p>"What? It's over twenty miles between here and Jubaan Ranma, you can't walk that."<p>"Its not that far and I need the time to think anyway, the walk will do me good."<p>Nabiki pulled out a small note pad she always carried around with her and wrote out her name, address, and a couple of phone numbers. "Give me a call sometime Ranma. I'd like to help you out of this mess if I can."<p>"You don't have to do that Nabiki." Ranma said hesitantly.<p>"I insist, your father used me and I need to make sure he doesn't try and do that again without knowing the consequences of doing that again."<p>"Don't do anything to bad to him."<p>"Moi?" Nabiki smirked, this was ground she could understand. "Not to worry Ranma, it won't involve pain in any way, I'll hit him where it counts, in his wallet."<p>"That I don't mind in the least. Good luck to you Nabiki." Ranma said and waved good by as she walked off down the street.<p>**********<p>Usagi screamed as she ran around the corner and slammed into someone and sent herself sprawling down on top of him. She heard and explosion of air and they both went down in a pile. Groaning she shook her head and opened her eyes and gaped as she looked into the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen. Her heart stopped and she gasped as little flowers seemed to flow behind her, she blushed. She could see that it was a most handsome man with dark hair and from the feel of things had quite a build as well. She smiled and wished her heart would stop pounding, she wondered why she was feeling so much warmer all of a sudden<p>"I...I'm s-sorry about that..." Usagi said as she struggled against her hormones, she blushed.<p>"You meatball headed thug, who told you to run around like that and run into people!" The boy yelled. "I could have been hurt or my clothes ruined!"<p>Usagi gasped and stared at the most beautiful man she had ever seen, her eyes filled with tears. "But...but..."<p>"You're a menace to society, do you always plow into people to come to a stop?"<p>Usagi's lower lip started to tremble.<p>"You're blonde too, don't you have any brains in that air headed mind of yours?"<p>WHAM!<p>"WHAAAAAAAAAAA!" Usagi wailed as she let go of the mallet and ran off in tears. On the ground Mamoru twitched under the mallet that had implanted his head and shoulders into the side walk, he wondered where all those insults had come from.<p>He groaned and sat up slowly and noticed that ever girl in the area was glaring at him, about half of them were holding glowing mallets and he knew that his day had just gone from bad to worse. Then someone tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around to see a red headed girl glaring at him. He stood up and held up his hands to keep her away, but didn't get a chance to say anything as she smirked at him.<p>"Usagi may not be all that smart at some things, but she doesn't deserve to be insulted like that either."<p>"It just popped out, I didn't mean any of it!" Mamoru stuttered out and backed up a step, this girl was giving him the creeps.<p>"Right, that's why she ran off in tears?" Ranma said as she sat her back pack on the ground, stretched her shoulders, and cracked her knuckles.<p>"No see here, we can talk this out..."<p>"You made Usagi cry, for that you're going down fast and hard." Ranma smirked. "Take your punishment like a man."<p>Mamoru noticed a number of the mallet holding girls nodding. He gulped and wondered if he should run for it.<p>Ranma threw out a slow punch to see how he reacted and confirmed her thoughts that he had a little training when he blocked it easily. She moved in and picked up the pace of her punches and soon had him backing up. She had taken on Youma and even Jedite, this little peon was nothing compared to them. Then he started to block more effectively and she noticed that the confused look on his face had finally changed to concentration as she pushed him at ever faster and faster speeds.<p>To Mamoru this was damned familiar and yet he couldn't ever remember meeting this girl before. Her moves were slighly familiar and yet far faster than anything he had ever encountered before. He knew instantly that he would not win against her, she was just to fast and her skill far above his own. He had to take her seriously or he would not only lose, but lose badly. With narrowed eyes he went form purely defensive to offensive in the blink of an eye.<p>Like that worked, Ranma just snorted, blocked the clumsy punch, and kicked him in the stomach. She kicked him a little harder than she had intended though and he went flying back with a grunt and slammed into the wall of the arcade. Some of the stone actually cracked as he hit and blew the air out of his lungs. He watched as the girl relaxed slightly and glared at him, for a second he thought she was going to continue the attack, but she crossed her arms instead.<p>"That will teach you to insult girls you don't even know, at least with me I'll at least live up to some of the insults." Ranma said with a grin.<p>Mamoru just groaned and lay there.<p>The red head walked over and picked up her pack again and glared at him for several seconds. "If I catch you insulting that girl again I'll break your legs boy, you watch yourself, or else." With that she turned and stalked away in the direction the blond had gone.<p>"No problem." He muttered and groaned as the climbed back to his feet and staggered into the Arcade where his friend worked. He sighed in relief as he found an open booth and crawled in, that girl had only hit him once and yet everything in his body hurt like she had been pounding on him for hours. He had no intentions of tangling with that red head again, though he did owe the blond cutie an apology for the way he had reacted. He would have to keep an eye out for here the next time he was here.<p>**********<p>Outside the irate group of women broke up and headed their seperate ways, one of them was a rather tall young girl with long brown hair done up in a pony tail. She had liked the looks of the guy the instant she had seen him, then he had opened his mouth and been pounded by the blond. Then the red head had shown up and kicked the crap out of him in a matter of seconds. She had recognized the fighting style as something she had learned a little of from some friends she had met a couple of years back.<p>Makoto Kino frowned and wondered what the chances of finding a practitioner of Anything Goes style at this time were. She took off after the girl she wanted to meet and soon caught sight of her bright red hair a couple of block ahead of her. That was the only reason she had noticed the girl, that hair made her stand out in a crowd, literally. She weaved her way through the crowded streets as fast as she could, but had to gape as the red head jumped onto a fence and used it as a short cut across the canal and over to a nearby street.<p>It was the most amazing feet of skill and balance she had ever seen, but she hadn't studied under Natsumi and Kurumi for nothing. She hopped up on the fence and took a step and blushed as she realized that any pervert could look up her long skirt, then shrugged and hopped they were at least cute. It took several minutes of slow progress to get across, she wasn't surprised to see the red head waiting for her at the other end with a smirk on her face.<p>"You should run along the fence, it helps you keep your balance a lot better than the slow and cautious rout." Ranma commented and took a fighting stance.<p>Makoto sweat dropped and shook her head. "Don't want to fight, I wanted to talk to you."<p>"You don't want to fight...I thought that was why you followed me?"<p>"Nope, just wanted to talk."<p>"About what?"<p>"That fighting style you are using, is it Anything Goes?"<p>Ranma nodded and smiled. "Yep, been training in it for over ten years now."<p>"T-ten years?" Makoto gasped in shock.<p>"I started as soon as I could walk and have been training ever since."<p>"Well I know some of the style, but the two girls that taught me had to move on and I was wondering if you could help me finish training in the style."<p>Ranma cocked her head. "You know some of the style? It is a pretty rare and dangerous art form and as far as I know there are only two families that practice the style. You said a girl taught you, did Akane Tendo teach you?"<p>"Who?" Makoto said and shook her head. "It was a pair of wandering martial artists named Natsumi and Kurumi, but they had to move on before I could get much more than the basics down."<p>"I've never heard of them." Ranma muttered to herself. She had thought she knew all the practitioners of her style and they could be counted on one hand. Ranma added the names to the small list of practitioners to look up some time later. "You want me to continue your training? Why?"<p>"I really enjoyed the style and I saw what you did to that guy a little while ago."<p>"I was just sticking up for Usagi's honor, that was nothing. As for training you, I'm not sure if I should."<p>Makoto frowned and visibly went from hopeful to dejected. "Why?"<p>"I've never actually taught anyone before and if I was to put you through what my father put me through, lets say you're just better off not knowing the style."<p>"I'm willing to take the risks!" Makoto said stubbornly.<p>Ranma kept her face stern as she glared at the tall girl. "Alright, for now I will train you, but you might not like some of the insane training you will have to go through."<p>"I'm strong enough to survive it, I've survived those grueling mountainous training grounds."<p>Ranma snorted. "Training grounds like those are for weaklings and barely teach you what you need to. Training under me will be REAL training and not that pansy stuff."<p>"Kurumi said something along the same lines." Makoto muttered to herself.<p>"She was correct, to be a real fighter you need to train all the time. None of this one or two hours a day crap, but all the time by making the simplest things into training. Walking along fences to help your balance and coordination, how to fall off a roof correctly, high jumps, endurance training, the whole nine yards." Ranma said with another smirk as Makoto gulped. "Well if I'm going to train you in anything, I need to know your name."<p>"Makoto Kino."<p>"Excellent, I'm Ranma Mazaki and I'm the best fighter in the world." Ranma bowed.<p>Makoto giggled and bowed back, with a squawk she fell off the fence into the canal with a mighty splash, but surfaced a few seconds later to hear Ranma laughing at her. Makoto swam to the edge of the slow moving water and crawled out onto the sloped bank and glared at Ranma as she cart wheeled across the fence and jumped off. She landed right beside Makoto and helped her the rest of the way up the canal.<p>"Do you know where the Hikawa Shrine is?"<p>"Sure, were about a mile or so from it."<p>"Meet me there Saturday afternoon when classes are out. Where a normal out fit and leave the Gi at home."<p>"Leave the Gi?"<p>"Where a jogging suit or shorts and a t-shirt, something comfortable and not very restrictive. A Gi is useless in a real fight and the called Anything Goes for a reason Makoto, you will be training in everything from shorts to nothing at all (if you make it that far)."<p>"I've never done that before..."<p>"Have you gotten in fights at school?"<p>"Of course!"<p>"Did you run home and change into a Gi to fight them?"<p>"Of course not, that's stupid...OH!"<p>"Exactly, you need to be able to fight in anything, anywhere, anytime."<p>"I see."<p>"Good, meet me at the shrine on Saturday."<p>"Okay Ranma!" Makoto said, hugged her new friend and ran off happily, for once not in a bad mood and angry at the world.<p>Ranma stood there in a shocked position, her long pig tail sticking nearly straight up. She hadn't expected her to do that she had found that it felt really good, what an unexpected thing. She staggered down the street trying to forget how Makoto's breasts had felt as they pressed against her own. Ranma wouldn't admit it, even under torture, but she had this silly little grin on her face...then she punched herself for being a pervert.<p>**********<p>Rei wandered into the Arcade to buy some ice cream to celebrate her getting an 'A' on a test at school. She was tired from having to study all night before and put up with that Nabiki character trying to get Ranma out of the temple for a few days. The peace and quiet had been almost to much to bare this morning, Ranma was always up with the dawn to practice. Out of habit of this she had woken up just as early this morning the sounds of her practice hadn't happened, Rei had actually missed it.<p>Still, her test had beckoned and she spent the time this morning studying things all over again. She had only missed one question and it had been on something she hadn't had a chance to study because it was one of the those surprise questions that teachers tossed in from the class discussions. Sigh, she couldn't even remember talking about the stupid thing and yet it had been on the test. Just as she was about to enter the Arcade she noticed that section of the wall beside the door that was slightly caved in and cracked. If she didn't hadn't known better she would have thought that someone had impacted against the wall, but if that was so that meant that a Youma was around. The lack of other damage make her thing other wise so she shrugged it off and headed inside. Rei made her way over to the counter, tossing her long black hair over her shoulder, and was getting ready to order when she stopped and saw this tall, handsome, dark haired hunk sitting in a booth. He was finishing off a hamburger and to Rei he looked yummy, she smiled.<p>As she got closer she noticed that the has several bruises forming on his arms, neck, and face. She was a skilled martial artist so she could detect the signs of a pretty good fight. Gliding over to the table she edged up to him when he wasn't paying attention and sat down across from him. He gasped and started to choke on his burger, but managed to control himself a few seconds later.<p>"Hi!" Rei said and smiled cutely at him.<p>"Um...hello, can I help you?" He asked.<p>"I'm Rei Hino and I was wondering what happened to you?"<p>"Mamoru Chiba I made a mistake of judgment and had to pay the price so to speak."<p>"Did you win?"<p>"I'm afraid not, but I didn't want to hurt the girl that did it to me so..." Mamoru said.<p>"A girl?" Rei gasped and wondered if this guy was some kind of handsome wimp.<p>"Yeah, this little red headed girl, a little over five foot or so, long red braid, red shirt and black pants..."<p>Rei gasped and narrowed her eyes, it couldn't be her, she had left this morning and wasn't expected back for several days. "What was her name?"<p>"I have no idea, she attacked me and slammed me against the wall outside with a kick."<p>"I saw the damage, but..."<p>"That girl has some serious power at her disposal."<p>"Why did this girl attack you?" Rei said as she decided to use the sympathy rout to his heart. She gazed at him while radiating concern and caring feelings.<p>Mamoru shifted nervously. "Well this other girl tried to run me down and I got mad at her and called her some names. I didn't mean to say some of the stuff I did, but I was already having a bad day and then she came along."<p>Rei nodded and silently wondered if this guy had actually deserved what had happened to him. There were not very many martial artists in the area with red hair in a long braid, Ranma was the only one she had ever seen or met. From the looks of things Ranma had only roughed him up for some reason so shrugged it off. She grabbed his hand and patted it while smiling at him. He gave her a nervous look, but she either ignored it or completely missed it. "It'll be alright."<p>"Hey Mamoru, who is your cute friend?" Motaki asked as he came up and in his Arcade apron.<p>"This is Rei, she was asking about the fight earlier."<p>"What a hoot!" Motoki said and laughed. "Mamoru-baka here insulted a girl to tears and this smaller one comes out of now where and beats the crap out of him. He's been afraid to leave ever since!"<p>Rei glanced at Mamoru, he winced and looked away. "Who was it that he insulted so bad?"<p>"Usagi of all people, the most gentle and peaceful girl I've ever met..."<p>"YOU INSULTED USAGI?" WHAM! Rei yelled and malleted the boy through the floor as a bright red aura flared around her.<p>"That's what Usagi did too, just before that cute red head showed up and beat him up." Motoki said happily.<p>"Humph!" Rei said as she stomped out of the Arcade. "Jerk!"<p>Mamoru groaned and wondered when his life had turned to hell. His friend just laughed at him and wandered off, but not after telling him that he had to pay for the damage he had caused because of this. He lifted himself out of the damaged seat and flopped down again, the bruise on his face was even more noticeable now. It seemed that drowning his problems in food wasn't working, so he had to find some other way.<p>Someone cleared their throat and he turned his head to see half a dozen angry women glaring at him. They all lifted their weapons and he tensed for a fraction of a second, then they charged and he leapt though the already damaged window. The girls followed and all of them soon vanished from sight, screaming insults, swear words, and other things that other random acts of violence.<p>He wondered how one blonde ditz could have so many friends in one place.<p>**********<p>Night had fallen by the time Ranma found Usagi and she stayed out of sight doing something that the Amazons had taught her. Assessing the situation and determining the best way to approach it to be more specific, she had learned how to do this in combat and normal situations. The breeze was blowing slowly through the park and ruffled Usagi's hair as she leaned against a tree, the tears were still streaming down her face. Ranma could tell that the girl was in pain and kind of understood why, her reaction to her father's hatred was along the same lines. She had learned to control the tears while traveling after she left the Amazon village.<p>Even now Ranma was on the verge of tears, but it had been several hours since she left that danmed dojo and her father. Those two fools had pretty much ruined any chance she might have given for a reconciliation now. For years she had wondered why her life was so harsh and cruel and never come up with an answer. The only way she had even survived the trip was to lock her real self away as she was beat to within an inch of her life day after day on the road. Indifference and uncaring had been comforting things in her life for years now, at least when it came to the old fool anyway. When she was younger she had cared for him, but that was gone now and only her hate for him was left. Jusenkyo had been the final straw, he had ruined her life with one simple hit and abandoned her for it because it went against what he thought was right.<p>Then there was the fact that no matter how much she hated him, she wanted him in her life again. He was constant that had been there for years, the one she could take her anger out on when she needed to. Now that was gone and she was stuck in this stupid body that brought her self hatred to a new low. If she hadn't made those promises to the Amazons she would have been gone a long time ago and left the funeral expenses to the old man just to spite him and get in the last dig. Instead she had to live this new life and she admitted that there were some benefits to it and had some fun at times, but when would she lean to accept this stupid form? That was the most pressing question, because of it she had avoided making friends with the Scouts.<p>Ranma nodded to herself, her pain would be lessoned if she was a little closer to the Scouts, they were a pretty close group of girls after all. She moved forward to see if Usagi needed anymore help, or just a good cry, as some of the Amazons had said. Usagi sniffled and wondered what she had done to deserve that kind of treatment. It had been a mistake, a bit of clumsiness that caused the problem, not her. Usagi drew her knees up to her chin and tried to fight off the pain she felt, she didn't even know why his words had hurt her so much. It should have been like dealing with her little brother, but instead she felt like he had broken some kind of trust or something. It was so weird.<p>She jerked as she saw a flash of red and looked up into Ranma's eyes as she knelt down to look her over. "Are you alright Usagi?"<p>"Huh?"<p>"Are you hurt, any broken bones or ripped clothing?" Ranma asked with a smile.<p>Usagi smiled back and was silently shocked at her reaction, Ranma had the oddest effect on her at times. "I'm fine really, he just insulted me, so no big deal."<p>"If his words hurt you Usagi then of course it's a big deal. I have dealt with jerks like him before and their always too full of themselves."<p>"I don't understand...I thought you didn't like me." Usagi said, but it was so quiet that Ranma almost didn't hear it. Almost.<p>She snorted and patted Usagi on the shoulder. "You and me are friends Usagi, I just treat you like I do all of my friends."<p>"You insult all of your friends?" Usagi gasped out and wasn't even able to understand what the girl in front of her was thinking.<p>"I haven't told you much about myself have I?" Ranma asked as she scooted over and leaned against the tree next to Usagi.<p>"None of us know much about you since you're always avoiding us for one reason or another."<p>Ranma was quiet for several minutes as she thought about what Usagi was saying and she realized that even before she had arrived at Jusenkyo she had been quite alone in the world. Sure she had her father, but what had that gotten her? Nothing but pain and abandonment all because the old fool wouldn't live up to his responsibility. "Alright Usagi, I won't tell you everything, but some of it I suppose."<p>Usagi nodded and sniffled back some tears.<p>"I was taken from my mother when I was just five years old and forced, not asked, but forced to learn martial arts. I haven't seen her in over ten years now and don't even know what she looks like."<p>"That's horrible."<p>Ranma shrugged. "From right off the bat I was taught how to fight, I was kicked out of bed at dawn and spent an hour being shown this move or that. Then pop would proceed to pound on me until I was bruised and out cold, he called it endurance training."<p>"That monster..." Usagi gasped.<p>Ranma let off a bitter laugh that scared Usagi. "Oh that was nothing, he moved from that to throwing me off of two and three story buildings or nearby trees to teach me how to fall right. When I failed I got a beating and had to do it until I had it perfect, then when I got that right pops didn't congratulate me or offer me praise. No, he moved onto the next technique and pounded that into with a brutal efficiency." There were certain subjects that Ranma wanted to avoid and the stupid curse was one of them. "To make matters worse he decided that he didn't want a daughter and raised me to be a boy, from the way I dressed to the way I acted it was always be a man in everything. For a five year old kid I could barely understand what was going on, but I learned some harsh lessons on those first few months of the trip."<p>"Li-Like what?"<p>"The biggest one was that I had to learn what the old man was teaching me or he would break every bone in my body until I did so. The old man was always spouting off these sayings like 'the path of a true martial artist is fought with peril' and 'those with the greatest amount of honor shine like stars'. The first I believe, the second I think he stole from a movie."<p>Usagi giggled a little and Ranma grinned a little more.<p>"Then came my hardest lesson under the old man, I wasn't allowed to have friends of any kind. They would make me soft and weaken me, make me vulnerable and easy prey for when I was in a dangerous situation. I had this friend named Ukyo, he was a little kid that was learning the ways of his family's fighting style and business. He was my first friend on the road and I think he wanted to come with us on the trip, but the old man tricked me." Ranma slammed her fist into the tree and made it shake, some of the bark fell off as she pulled her hand back.<p>"Ranma?"<p>"Sorry Usagi, these are memories that I don't like to remember very much, but they will help you understand me a bit. Okay, I didn't find this out until later this year and that was completely by accident when I was making my way here to Jubaan. It turns out Ukyo was supposed to go on the trip with us, but pop abandoned him to die because he didn't want me to have a friend. Because it would make me soft and weak."<p>This time Usagi burst into tears and latched onto Ranma. She really did like Usagi, but she was way to emotional for her tastes. "Did Luna explain to you about the Neko-Ken training?"<p>"Only a little, she didn't get into anything very detailed." Usagi sniffled out.<p>"I was seven when the old man put me through the Neko-Ken training, it was the ultimate betrayal of my trust in him. He promised that when I learned the technique I would be the most powerful martial artist in the world, and it worked, but not in the way he had thought it would. It drove me insane with fear, turning me into this cat like creature that was nearly impossible to kill or even hurt. I nearly killed the old man while in this state, but he managed to knock me out and get me back to normal, but forever afterward I was afraid of cats. That is until Ito showed up and locked the fear away as a type of cure for the technique."<p>"No more please..." Usagi said.<p>"Sure, you don't have to hear this if you don't want to, talk to Luna if you have to, I'm pretty sure that Ito has told Luna quite a bit about me." Ranma said sadly. She had been taught to try and find the best way to approach things, no one ever said she had picked up the skill. In battle she was flawless and perfect, but in social situations she was totally hopeless.<p>"It's not that...I want to hear all about you Ranma. Luna says you're our Princess and you're so different from everyone else I know. You have a way of looking at the world that is totally unique. I will hear everything, but if this is just the beginning I fear what is going to happen next."<p>"You don't have to Usagi..."<p>"Yes I do, we all need to know this...can I tell the others?"<p>Ranma considered it for several seconds before answering. "Sure, Rei knows a bit of it and Luna even more."<p>"Thanks Ranma, that means a lot to me." Usagi said and hugged Ranma again.<p>"Um...yeah." Ranma said and stepped away from the girl and moved over to a nearby bush and thrust her hand in. She pulled Luna out and smiled at the nervously sweating cat.<p>"Ranma..." Luna said as a sweat drop formed on her head.<p>"Hi Luna!" Ranma said happily. "You can tell the others about me, the information might come in handy."<p>"Thanks..." She said sarcastically.<p>Ranma pulled the cat close and whispered to it. "The curse is impossible to prove, leave that out. You heard what I said to Usagi, improvise when you need to, got it?"<p>"Sure...Princess."<p>"Right, then that's all I need for now." Ranma said and tossed the cat to Usagi with a grin. "Well then..."<p>Ranma was interrupted as the sky wavered and a giant image of Jedite stood there glaring down at the city. He had his arms folded and looked supremely pissed off, there was a dark blue aura around him that seemed to light up his hate filled eyes. "SAILOR SCOUTS, I JEDITE OF THE DARK KINGDOM OFFER YOU A SIMPLE CHALLENGE. I WILL FIGHT YOU LATER TONIGHT AT THE AIRPORT, WINNER TAKES ALL AND THE LOSERS DIE. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME OR DON'T SHOW UP I WILL DESTROY THIS CITY." The giant image yelled and spread his arms where twin balls of fire flared to life, he threw them into the heart of the city where a blast very similar to a nuclear blast took place and let everything in its path a destroyed ruin. Then after several seconds Jedite snapped his fingers and the destruction vanished.<p>"THAT WAS JUST AN ILLUSION, BUT IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP IT WILL BE A REALITY. I WILL BE WAITING." Jedite said and started to laugh evilly as he faded out and the sky returned to normal.<p>"Oh...my..." Thump!<p>Ranma spun around to see that Usagi had fainted and rolled her eyes at the girl, she may have been a Sailor Scout, but she sure was a fairly bad one. "Well that is a pretty typical reaction."<p>"I'll say." Luna said with an exasperated tone of voice.<p>**********<p>To Be Continued...<p>End Notes - I need to give a few thanks to my new prereaders who gave me a hand with these two new chapter.<p>James Merritt<br/>Rezantis<br/>Sybersmilodon<br/>Stephen Price
