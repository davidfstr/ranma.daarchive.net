</div><br/>Notes - This is the second version of this chapter, if anyone has the<br/>original floating around, please burn it and replace it. I posted Princess<br/>04 and Replacement 05 to soon and ended up posting a couple of chapters I<br/>started to hate. So I rewrote both chapters. I hope this version is a lot<br/>better than that crap I sent out earlier, the more I looked at them the<br/>more I wanted to do something different with them or correct them.<p>On this fic I have received a number of complaints that told me that I have<br/>some dates, names, and times wrong. I have corrected these and will be<br/>reposting the newer chapters along with this one. Most of the changes are<br/>minor word rearrangements and such or a paragraph here and there, but they<br/>should fix a number of things that people have been telling me about. ^^<p>**********<p>Princess of the Moon<p>Chapter 04<p>By C. Rose<p>(c)2001<p>**********<p>"What are you doing here Rei?" Usagi gripes.<p>She had seen this add on TV for this contest to give away two tickets to<br/>the Love Cruise and since she had lost out to Ranma several days ago and<br/>she was going to get these, then she could ask Andrew to come with her. She<br/>hopped in line and waited for several minutes, but eventually made it to<br/>the counter and saw a large bowl full of red beads. The sign said there was<br/>a gold bead in there somewhere, but she didn't see it. She grabbed the<br/>handle that spun the bowl and groaned as a red bead popped out. Then she<br/>turned to walk away when she spotted Rei watching her, a strange look on<br/>her face.<p>"What's it to you Meatball Head." She had heard Mamoru call Usagi that at<br/>the carnival and liked the sound of it instantly. "I want those tickets!"<p>"But you don't even have a boyfriend!"<p>They argue back and forth for several minutes, but Rei eventually gets<br/>bored and hops in line as she sticks her tongue out at Usagi. Several<br/>minutes later she makes it to the counter and she smiles shyly as she<br/>concentrates and spins the handle...and out pops the gold bead. She jumps<br/>for joy. "Alright!"<p>"WE HAVE A WINNER!"<p>"She used that strange power of hers to cheat." Usagi mutters, mad that her<br/>friend would cheat in that way. Still, she had to take someone, and they<br/>were friends. "Rei who are you going to take, Grandpa?"<p>"You aren't touching these tickets Usagi." Rei says in a huff.<p>"But Rei? The Scouts should stick together..."<p>Rei growls and spots Ami heading their way and smiles. "Your right Usagi,<br/>we should. Ami!"<p>"Huh?" Usagi gets out just as Rei runs off.<p>"Ami come here, I've got good news!" Rei yells.<p>"What is Rei?" Ami starts, but Rei grabs her and drags her off to a nearby<br/>cafe. They grab a table and Rei explains about the tickets. Usagi sneaks up<br/>to the bushes outside the window where they are sitting and listens in as<br/>best she can.<p>"Aren't you going to invite Usagi? She really wants to go on that cruise."<br/>Ami says.<p>"No, she's been acting like a real brat lately." Rei snaps.<p>"But...I would feel guilty if I went and she didn't."<p>"Don't worry about it, we can pick her up a nice...souvenir or something,<br/>like a hat." Rei says.<p>"Okay, I'll go." Ami says, the cruise did sound like a good idea and a lot<br/>of fun. Rei and Ami run off making plans, the cruise left in a few days and<br/>it didn't leave them much time to get ready. Usagi hears this and starts to<br/>get really mad, she got up and hid before they could see her face as she<br/>tried to control her anger. She backed into an alley to figure out why her<br/>friends were doing this to her, it just didn't make sense that both of them<br/>would be out to hurt her.<p>"Usagi!" Luna yelled as she ran up.<p>"Hi Luna." Usagi said, sounding mad and depressed.<p>"Usagi, I managed to get in contact with the princess."<p>"That's nice Luna."<p>"Usagi, didn't you hear what I just said!" Luna yelled.<p>"Yeah, yeah, whatever Luna." Usagi muttered, her mind on other things. She<br/>looked up as Luna's words finally registered, to bad she hadn't been paying<br/>attention. Ranma's red haired visage was less than an inch from hers and<br/>smiling like she was thinking dirty thoughts. Usagi screamed and jumped<br/>five feet in the air and landed with a crash, her ass in the air and her<br/>skirt flared just so.<p>Ranma just blinked and wondered what it was with this girl and showing off<br/>her panties like that, heck, all girls for that matter. She did have a nice<br/>round, firm, ass though, Ranma had to admit and being a girl full time gave<br/>her ample time to see these things. She grinned down at Usagi and helped<br/>her to her feet, the girl was blushing so red that heat was wafting off of<br/>her. "Hi Usagi, I met your cat."<p>"L-Luna?"<p>"Yep, talks a mile a minute too, couldn't get her to shut up for<br/>anything..." Ranma yelped as said cat took a swipe at her ankle with claws<br/>extended. She edged away and giggled nervously, reminding herself not to<br/>tease the talking cats.<p>"Ranma!" Chorused Luna and Ito.<p>Usagi noticed the red cat at Ranma's feet and gasped. "Ohhhh, Luna is she<br/>like you?"<p>"Yes Usagi, this is Ito, Ranma's adviser."<p>"Hello Ito!" Usagi yelled and kneeled down to pet her. Ito may have been a<br/>farie cat, arrogant, and intelligent, but she was also a shameless cat and<br/>loved to be petted. She rumbled into a loud purr and rubbed herself up<br/>against Usagi, smirking at Luna.<p>"What's wrong Usagi, you looked a little peeved a little while ago and that<br/>isn't an emotion that you use much." Ranma asked.<p>"Ami and Rei are going on that Love Cruise, without me."<p>"What's so important about that Cruise?"<p>"We do have some things to talk about you two." Luna interrupted, but Ranma<br/>and Usagi just ignored her.<p>"You won those tickets at school, now you can take any boy you want with<br/>you. I wanted that...is something wrong?" Usagi asked, Ranma had gone a<br/>little pale when she mentioned boys.<p>"Um...heheheh...no...nothings wrong, I've just had a few bad experiences<br/>with boys in the past...yeah." Ranma lied, badly.<p>Ito rolled her eyes and wondered if Ranma would ever accept her new form,<br/>sure it had only been a few months, but being female was better than<br/>anything else, wasn't it?<p>"Oh you poor thing." Usagi's heart melted as she wrapped Ranma in a hug.<br/>"Don't let the past hurt you like that, things will get better." Why had<br/>Ranma tensed up like this?<p>"I-it's nothing to w-worry about Usagi." Ranma tried, trying to stop the<br/>strange feelings she was getting. Ito and Luna just giggled at her. "Do you<br/>want to go on that cruise that badly?"<p>Usagi stepped back and gave Ranma a look that said they would talk later,<br/>then nodded. "I wanted to take Andrew from the arcade or even one of my<br/>friends if he wasn't available, like Naru."<p>"W-well you can have one of mine if you want it, Usagi."<p>"Hey, you two...we...have..." Luna tied again, getting madder by the<br/>minute.<p>"What, but those are for you and your boyfriend?"<p>"Like I want anything to do with a boyfriend Usagi, your my friend, here<br/>you can have one of mine. I hadn't really planned on going, but if you do<br/>I'll go to." Ranma said and choked up again as Usagi squealed and hugged<br/>her again. She blushed when she realized that Usagi was really pressing up<br/>against her.<p>"!" Usagi<br/>screamed as she jumped up and down, still hugging Ranma.<p>"Your welcome Usagi." Ranma said as she blushed.<p>"But you will have to do me one little favor." Usagi said suddenly.<p>"What's that?"<p>Usagi rubbed the back of her head and laughed nervously, blushing a little.<br/>"Your going to have to help me get up early so that we get to the ship as<br/>soon as possible."<p>Luna sighed and gave up, nodding her head and giving Ito a cat shrug. "She<br/>is totally hopeless in that area."<p>"What's so hard about that?"<p>"Um...heheheh...it's really hard to wake me up, it's why I'm late for<br/>school every morning."<p>"Okay Usagi, I think I can do that." Ranma said with a smirk, she'd used to<br/>have the same problem a couple years ago, but his father had found a way to<br/>cure him of his laziness. She grinned and sized up Usagi's potential and<br/>was surprised to find that she had tons, all of it wild and unfocused.<p>Usagi hugged her, again, and squealed in delight. This was possibly the<br/>weirdest girl Ranma had ever encountered. She kept her grin firmly in place<br/>and tired to think of a way to get her to calm down. Usagi was now bouncing<br/>around like her namesake, a rabbit, and had bits of her anatomy that were<br/>moving in ways that made Ranma feel funny. Whatever it was Ranma liked the<br/>way it felt, completely missing the fact that her nipples had just hardened<br/>noticeably. Looking for a way out of this mess, Ranma decided that it would<br/>be a good idea to grab something to eat.<p>Her stomach growled, loudly, and caused Usagi to stop her bouncing around<br/>and to make her laugh. Ranma just blushed and giggled along with her.<br/>"Would you like to go and grab something to eat Usagi?"<p>"Sure, the arcade is nearby, we can eat there and discus what we want to do<br/>while on the Cruise."<p>"That sounds like a lot of fun and a good idea."<p>They ran off, Usagi absentmindedly dragging Ranma along by her hand.<br/>Ranma's hand was tingling and she didn't understand why, she was also<br/>feeling a little warm all of a sudden. These thought and other more Hentai<br/>thoughts flashed through her mind, so she can be excused for forgetting<br/>about the two cats that had been watching the whole conversation with<br/>interest. Up to and including Ranma's odd reactions to Usagi's open nature.<p>"From the looks of that, I would say the Ranma's Princess instincts are<br/>still working about normal." Luna said.<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"Hmmm...oh...back in the Silver Millennium most of the princesses were what<br/>are called Bisexual now a days."<p>"Oh, um...Luna, Ranma has absolutely no interest in men. I'd be willing to<br/>bet my life on it, she is girls only."<p>"Why do you say that?" Asked a surprised Luna.<p>"Just a hunch." Ito said, trying not to smirk.<p>**********<p>It was the next day and Ranma was running across the roof's of houses for<br/>the mile run from the temple to Usagi's house, she easily jumped across<br/>intersections and ran over the street lights as if out for a daily jog or<br/>something. Most of the drivers that saw this could only gape and run into<br/>the car in front of them. Why? Well Ranma has no sense of modesty and was<br/>running in her school uniform, a skirt and blouse combo, that meant<br/>panties, that meant the men in the cars were looking up her dress as she<br/>sailed past. Distracting them enough that they ran into the car in front of<br/>them, needless to say that by the time Ranma arrived at Usagi's house she<br/>had caused the fifth largest traffic jam in the Jubaan district that year.<br/>Emergency workers were not sure what to do with the thirty or so perverts<br/>that were wandering around mumbling about white silk panties. Ranma figured<br/>if she had to wear them, the school frowned upon her wearing her gym shorts<br/>under her skirt, she would wear the best and most comfortable and that<br/>meant silk and satin panties, all black, red, or white. She had just<br/>stopped by the school to let them know that she and Usagi would be out of<br/>classes for the next two days while they were on the Cruise, they insisted<br/>that they be in uniform anytime they were on school grounds. It was weird<br/>rule, but Ranma had been wearing skirts off and on for weeks now. She had<br/>found that instead of being freaked out by them or developing a loathing to<br/>them she had grown uncaring. It was a dress, big deal, she had more<br/>important things to worry about, like breakfast, which she had skipped to<br/>get to the school on time.<p>She launched off the wall outside Usagi's house and landed in the front<br/>yard by the door, her skirt flaring up to show off her perfectly toned<br/>legs. Kenji, just walking out of the house gets an eye full and falls into<br/>a drooling faint. Ranma ignores him as she steps around another pervert and<br/>knocks on the door, her thought were still on what happened during her run,<br/>she couldn't figure out what the fuss was for, she was just out running and<br/>having a little fun so there was no reason for all those guys to crash<br/>their cars. Usagi's mother opens the door and smiles at Ranma.<p>"Hello Ranma, Usagi said you would be by today to help her get up and ready<br/>for that cruise she has a ticket for."<p>"Yeah, she wanted to go really bad and I had this extra ticket..."<p>"You gave her that ticket, she never mentioned that, just that she was<br/>desperate to go on that silly thing."<p>"I agree with you on the silly part, but Rei and Ami are going as well and<br/>Usagi wants to be with them." Ranma bit down on her tongue to keep from<br/>mentioning that Usagi might be looking for revenge against Rei, but that<br/>was Usagi's business.<p>"Their going too? Do you know who they are taking as dates?"<p>"Sorry Mrs. Tsukino, I have no idea."<p>"Oh well, head up to her room and see if you can rouse the dead. She could<br/>sleep through a nuclear blast and only complain about turning the radio<br/>down."<p>"She's that bad?"<p>"Oh yes, probably much worse than what you have heard."<p>"You know that sounds like something I went through a couple years ago<br/>myself, but I got over it."<p>"Do you know what happened to make you that way?"<p>"Oh sure, I thought I was coming down with some kind of sleeping sickness<br/>so I went to see a doctor about it." Ranma started, deciding she didn't<br/>need to know about the fight she'd had with her father, the chase across<br/>every roof in the city they had been at the time, the cops, the explosions<br/>and falling into a warehouse full of kidnappers holding a number of doctors<br/>for ransom from a local hospital. "The Doc I talked to said it sounded like<br/>an adolescent growth spurt, the body burned ten times more energy, balance<br/>was screw...eh hehe...messed up, and I had to eat more food in a day than<br/>even my father and he can pack it away like you wouldn't believe."<p>"A growth spurt? That may be why Usagi is so clumsy too, what a fascinating<br/>idea and one I never considered before. How did your father ever manage to<br/>wake you up if you were always falling asleep?"<p>Ranma had a quick flash of Genma tossing 'him' off the roof of a four story<br/>building, jumping after him with fists and feet flying. "We usually sparred<br/>in the mornings, he kind of trained it out of me over a period of months."<p>"That won't work for Usagi I'm afraid."<p>"Nope, I wasn't even considering it, instead I was thinking of pop's other<br/>method."<p>"Other method?"<p>Ranma grinned and pulled a bucket of water from nowhere, sloshing a little<br/>on the ground. "Alternative method."<p>Mrs. Tsukino giggled and pointed up the stairs. "First door on the right."<br/>She turned to shut the door and spotted her husband out cold on the lawn,<br/>he was drooling like he had the first time she showed him her underwear.<br/>She glowered and stalked out to give him a little lesson...<p>Ranma breezed forward like the panther on the prowl, grinning like an<br/>idiot, and made her way silently up the stairs. She frowned as a young boy<br/>walked out of his room across the hall from Usagi's and gaped at her, she<br/>silenced him with a finger to her lips and pointed to the bucket and<br/>Usagi's door. It took a second but the kid turned red and had to grab his<br/>mouth as he nearly exploded in laughter, he ran back into his room and<br/>grabbed his pillow off the bed.<p>Usagi's door was unlocked and Ranma moved into the room to see Usagi curled<br/>around her pillow, drooling onto the mattress, she giggled in her sleep. It<br/>was one of the cutest things Ranma had ever seen, she had to bite her<br/>tongue to keep from touching the blonde. Ranma had never seen pajamas like<br/>Usagi's either, a white and red combo covered with little pictures of<br/>rabbits. Ranma walked over to the bed and spotted a sleeping Luna splayed<br/>out on the foot of the bed, she was giving off these light snores. Ranma<br/>tapped her on the head and grinned as she hissed and fell off the bed. She<br/>glared up at him until she spotted the bucket Ranma was holding.<p>"You wouldn't?" Luna hissed.<p>"I would." Ranma said calmly.<p>"She isn't going to be happy!"<p>"Heh!" Ranma said and swirled the water in the bucket. "Usagi, time to get<br/>up just like you requested!" Ranma said loudly.<p>Usagi snuggled against her pillow. "mph...imsa."<p>Ranma shrugged and decided to give her one more chance to wake up before<br/>she used the bucket, she grabbed the side of the mattress and lifted it,<br/>spilling Usagi on the floor with a thump. She still didn't wake up! Ranma<br/>shrugged again and tapped Usagi on her head, it had no effect what so ever.<br/>Ranma shrugged and upended the bucket over Usagi's head and hopped back out<br/>into the hall.<p>Usagi screamed and flailed around as she suddenly found herself soaked to<br/>the bone, it brought the whole house running. Shingo, Mrs. Tsukino, and<br/>Ranma all laughed as Usagi finally settled down and pieced together what<br/>had happened. She glared at Ranma, who was peaking around the door, her<br/>long red hair nearly touching the floor. Usagi burst into a large red<br/>battle aura and stumbled to her feet. "!"<p>"Eeeppp!" Ranma said with a grin and headed for the stairs with Usagi<br/>flying right after her with a growl.<p>They were soon in the front yard and Ranma was giggling loudly as she<br/>bounced all over the yard with Usagi trying to catch her on the ground<br/>snarling in anger. It was one of the few times anyone had ever seen Usagi<br/>actually mad at anyone, still, Ranma's little joke did deserve a little<br/>violence and everyone was getting a good laugh out of it. Shingo<br/>especially.<p>"Come back here Ranma!"<p>"Come on Odango, can't you take a joke?"<p>Usagi snarled and nearly caught Ranma by the ankle, but Ranma just twisted<br/>away and bounced off the fence and did a spinning flip over her head and<br/>using two fingers on top of Usagi's head as a pivot point. This continued<br/>for several minutes and Ranma was impressed with Usagi's stamina, she had<br/>been going full out for the whole time and was still breathing normally.<br/>Eventually Mrs. Tsukino took pity on Usagi and called her inside, Usagi<br/>gave a snarl and stomped inside, her long ponytails rising up indignantly.<p>"Come on Usagi, can't you take a joke?"<p>"I'm soaking wet!"<p>"But you wouldn't wake up!"<p>"Aghhhhhhhh!" Usagi's voice came back, Ranma winced and grinned at<br/>Usagi's mother who was trying very hard to not laugh at her daughter.<p>"That wasn't a very nice thing to do Ranma."<p>"Maybe, but is was a lot of fun." She countered.<p>"Would you like to have breakfast with us?"<p>Breakfast was an education for the whole Tsukino family and Ikuko silently<br/>declared that she would be more prepared the next time Ranma showed up to<br/>eat, that is if she allowed the girl to ever come back. She was as bad as<br/>Usagi and had a stomach just as deep. Of course the eating contest by the<br/>two was an eye opener, especially when Ranma and Usagi started stealing<br/>each other's food, right off each others plates. Then they had started<br/>taking from the rest of the family, then the table, then what was left on<br/>the stove, then they had the nerve to switch to the refrigerator. By that<br/>time they had totally forgotten about the rest of them, so Ikuko grabbed<br/>them and tossed them out the front door with Usagi's packed bags for the<br/>trip. It gave her a warm and fuzzy feeling when the four bags bounced off<br/>Ranma's head. One slammed door and the two teen were on their own.<p>They staggered to their feet, Usagi stomping off out of the yard with a<br/>growl that surprised Ranma. She was confused at first, then thought she<br/>might have actually been mad at her. That actually came as a surprise, what<br/>had she done to piss the girl off? Sure the water was a little out there<br/>and just maybe could have been used a little differently, but it was all in<br/>good fun. "Usagi wait up!"<p>"Humph!" Came back and Ranma grabbed the bags and ran to catch up.<p>"What's wrong?"<p>"Like you don't know!"<p>"I was just playing Usagi, I used to do that all the time with pops and he<br/>never complained or got mad."<p>"You poured water on me!"<p>"So, I used to get flung out third story windows while I was asleep. What's<br/>a little water."<p>"Do I look like your father?" Usagi snapped out, her pony tails raising<br/>indignantly, again.<p>"Hell no, your a thousand time more good looking than the panda."<p>Usagi, who was used to fighting with Rei and going at like this for half an<br/>hour or more blinked as her anger seemed to just vanish. She started to<br/>blush and faltered enough to let Ranma catch up with her. No one had ever<br/>given her a complement quite like that one before, she didn't know what to<br/>think of it.<p>"I really didn't think the water would make you that mad Usagi."<p>"Um..."<p>"And you did ask me to wake you up."<p>"Well..."<p>"I even tried rolling you off the bed to the floor and you just kept right<br/>on snoring away."<p>"I DON'T SNORE!" Usagi yelled out, her fogged mind snapping back.<p>Ranma blinked and looked at her curiously, then he smirked and looked<br/>around and Usagi 'eeped' when she noticed they were surrounded by dozens of<br/>couples heading for the docks. They were all looking at her and Usagi<br/>realized that she was still wearing her bunny pajamas, with the rabbits.<br/>She screeched loud enough to make even more people notice her and broke the<br/>sound barrier as she grabbed one of the suit cases and ran to a nearby<br/>public bathhouse. Ranma blinked and grinned as soon as the blonde was out<br/>of sight. She couldn't believe just how cute that girl turned when she was<br/>mad, she developed these little dimples and lost all focus for a second.<br/>Even that weird hair do looked cute when it lifted up as if by magic when<br/>her battle aura was actually visible when she got really mad. That girl had<br/>tons of potential too.<p>In the bathroom Usagi was bright red as she quickly changed into a sun<br/>dress and tossed on some make up. She was still steamed, there was this<br/>desire to grab a large object and bash Ranma over the head with it. Then<br/>there was this other thing that was beginning to bother her, Ranma was<br/>treating her just like Mamoru did, insults and all. On some levels she was<br/>hurt by Ranma's words, but she couldn't pin down just what was up with that<br/>girl. She hadn't really wanted the tickets and yet had taken the time to<br/>win a pair. Had she expected to lose or had she been planning something, it<br/>just didn't make sense to her. Then there was the other thing her mind kept<br/>skirting around, Ranma's dislike of the boys at school.<p>Even Umino hadn't been able to pin down a history on Ranma and it was<br/>driving him mad. There was supposed to be a boy named Ranma, but he didn't<br/>have any sisters or family that could have explained a female Ranma. There<br/>was the half baked idea that the female Ranma was in fact the male one, but<br/>that was impossible. She and nearly twenty other girls had seen Ranma naked<br/>in the showers after PE and she had a body to die for. No fat, sculpted<br/>muscles that made her look fantastic, was a 'natural' red head, she had the<br/>right equipment for a girl both above and below. There was no way she could<br/>be the boy that had her same name.<p>Usagi was beginning to believe that one rumor she had heard was true<br/>though, that Ranma was a lesbian. She flirted shyly with most of the girls<br/>she had been introduced to and liked to play jokes that would end up with a<br/>girl showing off various pieces of their bodies, wet t-shirts, falling so<br/>that one's panties were exposed and such. Then there was that mysterious<br/>smile that she developed when she thought no one was looking, as if she was<br/>privy to a joke that only she understood. That smile was what had captured<br/>Usagi's imagination lately, what it meant was beyond her, but figuring it<br/>out was going to be fun if she was right.<p>Usagi finished with her lipstick and stepped back to check herself out,<br/>smiled and packed the offending pajamas in the case, slipped into her inch<br/>high heels, and walked out of the bathhouse's locker restroom looking<br/>confident and alluring. She stepped outside and spotted Ranma just as she<br/>looked her way and spotted her as well. The girl seemed to pale for a<br/>second, then turned a little pink as she blushed, it made Usagi give a<br/>mental nod. Ranma had to be a lesbian or a Bi, nothing else made sense, but<br/>even she may have not been aware of it because she wasn't very blatant<br/>about her attractions. Usagi, though fourteen, noticed something else as<br/>well about Ranma. The girl was naive about anything dealing with girls and<br/>boys, it may have been the reason why she was so shy at times and so<br/>forward at others. She was glad she had decided to wear the heels, that<br/>made her feel more grown up in some ways.<p>"Ranma, are you going to wear that school uniform on the cruise?"<p>"Naw, just until we get to our cabin, then I was planning to change into my<br/>swimsuit and heading to the pool."<p>"First thing?"<p>"Yeah."<p>"We probably won't be heading out until later this afternoon and we will<br/>have to mingle among the crowd to get a better idea of what all we can do<br/>while aboard."<p>Ranma shrugged as she tried to regain control of her mind as perverted<br/>thoughts assailed her from all angles. She still had a male mind after all<br/>these months and Usagi was a very good looking girl no matter how weird her<br/>hair style was. The girl actually looked older than Ranma now and that was<br/>a little scary, the make up was noticeable, but it seemed to only make a<br/>woman out of a cute teenager. Ranma swallowed and looked at how interesting<br/>her feet were for a second. Shaking herself, Ranma pointed to the line for<br/>the boarding passengers.<p>"Let's get in line and you can continue to fill me in on what else one can<br/>do while on board a ship like this."<p>"Alright Ranma, by the way have you seen Rei or Ami?"<p>"No, but we are several hours early so they may show up later. Rei was<br/>still getting ready when I left this morning."<p>"Oh, well lets go and get settled."<p>The ship was quite beautiful and over filled with people, everywhere they<br/>went there were more guests and activities. Even heading down to their<br/>rooms, Ranma and Usagi encountered several of the crew. They were helping<br/>guests with excess baggage and such, it was quite a sight. Several of the<br/>guests were already quite drunk or drinking, Ranma ignored them, she just<br/>wanted to their room and change into her more comfortable clothing.<p>**********<p>Meanwhile in another part of the ship the co-Captain's of the cruise,<br/>Jedite and Titus are looking over a large device that they used to convert<br/>the entire ship to their use. It had been child's play to take over the<br/>ship and it would be even more simple to dispose of it once they were done<br/>with it. Jedite was pacing back and forth, his arrogance evident in his<br/>every step. "An excellent plan Titus, I hadn't expected this kind of turn<br/>out. We will take huge amounts of energy here!"<p>Titus was one of the few Youma that had advanced enough to attain a kind of<br/>human personality over the years, that had earned her the title of a High<br/>Youma. Only one in a hundred Youma could attain the true intelligence and<br/>freedom Titus had earned, she had done it through skill and a little luck.<br/>She was quite beautiful in her uniform and exuded a kind of sexuality that<br/>drew the eye from across the room. "Yes Jedite, there is no way those<br/>Scouts can bother us all the way out on the ocean and we can dispose of the<br/>evidence easily after were done. A win/win situation."<p>"Indeed Titus, this is a plan that can not fail!" Jedite crows.<p>The door to the room opens and a crew member looks inside. "Sir, all the<br/>guests are boarded."<p>"Then cast off and take us out."<p>"Yes sir!"<p>"Are you sure those things aren't going to give us away?" Titus asks.<p>"Their just low level Youma, they are to weak to cause to much damage and<br/>make great servants and cannon fodder if needed. Oh yeah, I have a little<br/>something I want you to do to. There was a red headed girl that boarded<br/>earlier..."<p>"I remember her, she stood out like a sore thumb when she and that blonde<br/>haired girl came aboard."<p>"Yes, I want you to watch that red head."<p>"Sure, but why?"<p>"She is the one I fought the a few weeks back, I want to make it a point to<br/>isolate her and kill her."<p>Titus' eyes narrow and she nodded. "Yes sir, I understand."<p>"Excellent." Jedite said and walked off.<p>Several minutes later the ship casts off and the they slowly make their way<br/>out to sea. Most of the guests are used to traveling like this, but a few<br/>like Rei and Ami are having problems as they walk down the hallway. They<br/>are barely able to keep their balance as the ship sways to and fro. Ami is<br/>in a green formal dress and Rei in a red one, they make quite the sight as<br/>they move around. Rei loves the attention, but Ami is to shy to even accept<br/>it.<p>"Rei, have you noticed that were the only ones here without dates?" Ami<br/>asks.<p>"Yeah, a date would have been cool, but I'm happy to be with you as well<br/>Ami, were friends after all."<p>"Thanks Rei!"<p>Rei gets this look on her face and grins, she tastes it again and giggles.<br/>"Hey Ami, lets flirt with some of the crew guys and get someone to take a<br/>picture of it."<p>"Why?"<p>"To get Usagi jealous of course!"<p>"You two need to make up, this fighting is just stupid." Ami snaps and<br/>pulls out a book to read as they walk. She suddenly had no problems with<br/>the way the ship is moving, to bad Rei can't say the same.<p>**********<p>Usagi twirls around her room and smile happily, she was here and it was<br/>just perfect. Well not perfect, she had Ranma here instead of Motoki at the<br/>arcade, but it was still good. She tossed her bags on bed and heard<br/>something she didn't want to hear. The sound of someone saying "Ouch..."<p>"What was that?" Ranma asked.<p>"I don't know, it came from one of the bags."<p>Usagi grabbed her makeup case and flipped the hard cover open and jumped<br/>half way across the room as Luna and Ito tumbled out onto the bed. Both of<br/>them cursing up a storm. "That was uncalled for Young Lady!" Ito yelled as<br/>she fell off the bed and landed on her head.<p>"What were the two of you thinking, just leaving like that, there are<br/>monsters running around Tokyo you know. We have protect the citizens from<br/>them, or had you forgotten?" Luna yelled out. She hadn't fallen off the<br/>bed, but rolled end over end until she fell across the pillows.<p>"Where here to relax a little and have a little fun, pick up some guys,<br/>make out a little, have fun!" Usagi said.<p>Ranma just about fell off her chair at that, but managed to stay in place<br/>and silently deny it. She glared down at Ito, but found that she was<br/>glaring right back with a smirk across her little kitty face. The red cat<br/>rolled to her feet and stretched out to nearly double her length and<br/>unsheathed her claws. "You should have thought this trip out a little more<br/>Princess, there are lives at stake here and your running around playing<br/>dress up?"<p>"Hey, I don't play dress up!" Ranma yelled.<p>Ito hissed and pounced at Ranma, but she Eeeeeeped! and attached herself<br/>to the cabin's ceiling. The red cat sailed through the space where Ranma<br/>had been and slammed head first into the chair, knocking it over. Ito<br/>rolled over and jumped at Ranma as she hung from the ceiling, she missed by<br/>a foot or two, but Ranma was just out of reach.<p>"Get down here and take your punishment!"<p>"No way!"<p>"I'll get you yet Ranma!"<p>"Not on your best day, cat." Ranma stuck her tongue out at Ito.<p>"DIE!"<p>Meanwhile across the room, Usagi was getting the third degree from Luna.<br/>"Well?"<p>"Why are you here?"<p>"Um..." Usagi began, then had an idea. "Where here to check out the cruise,<br/>it seemed a little odd to me."<p>"Likely story Usagi, you just wanted another chance to goof off!"<p>"It's true, there's something odd with this cruise, I just don't know<br/>what."<p>"Then why did you bring so many of your good clothes and makeup Usagi?"<br/>Luna snapped.<p>"Undercover work!"<p>"Right." Massive amounts of sarcasm were evident in Luna's voice.<p>Usagi stomped and glared at the cat, she may have been lying, but she<br/>wasn't about to admit it to the cat now. She pulled out her transformation<br/>pen and held it up high, commanding it to turn her into a photographer. One<br/>light show later and she was ready to work the ship over. "See, I will find<br/>out what is wrong!" Usagi said in a huff, grabbed Luna, stuffed her into<br/>the makeup case again and stomped out of the room.<p>"I'll be back later Ranma!" She called out just before she left the room.<p>"Good luck Usagi!" Ranma yelled as she waved back, Eeeeeeeeped, and fell to<br/>the floor just as the red fur ball attacked in all it's fury. The following<br/>fight is to gruesome to detail and only those with hearty constitutions<br/>could stomach it anyway. As for Ranma, she is soon laid out on the bed<br/>amidst all the baggage, her clothing shredded completely.<p>A little while later Usagi is in the ship's souvenir stood looking around<br/>the area. She is catching some stares as she is tiptoeing around isles,<br/>staring at everyone in a suspicious way. The rack of sunglasses at the back<br/>of the store catch her eyes and she seems to materialize in front of them.<br/>The man behind the counter grins at an easy sale and hops over to help the<br/>young lady out. His eyes glint when he looks at all the merchandise in the<br/>little store, every bit of it will drain one's energy and give it to Master<br/>Jedite, but only he and the crew know this.<p>Usagi on the other hand could care less, the sun glasses are the coolest<br/>things she has ever seen. "These are so Kawaii!" She squeals and starts put<br/>each set on and looking at her self in the mirror. The disguise pen had<br/>done a number on her looks, that was for sure. Where before she had been a<br/>cute teenager, she was now a more mature looking woman with short blonde<br/>hair. She didn't know what to make of the change, but knew that no one<br/>would recognize her like this.<p>She grabbed the most 'spy' looking sunglasses she could find and paid for<br/>them. Little did she know that her mere presence had disrupted all the<br/>energy stealing items in the store. The sales drone wouldn't even notice<br/>until it was too late to fix things and by that time he would be toast.<br/>After that Usagi made her way through the various areas of the ship, danced<br/>with one of the crew in the ball room, played a few games while on deck,<br/>then joined a tour that was showing off various portions of the ship.<p>By this time, it had been several hours and Luna, who was watching through<br/>some air holes she had cut through the makeup bag, was getting angry. She<br/>popped her claws and began to sharpen them, they were super hard and sharp<br/>after all. As a Farie cat she had to have some special abilities and being<br/>able to cut through most solid objects was hers. Luna noticed that they<br/>were heading into the hold area and slashed at the back of the case.<p>The sudden pain in Usagi's side made her jump, startling some of the other<br/>passengers around her. She laughed nervously and stepped into a nearby room<br/>and opened the case. Luna poked her head out and gasped for air, glaring at<br/>Usagi and held up one of her claws. A beam of light reflected off the top<br/>edge of it and a 'Sheeeeen' sound seemed to fill the room.<p>"U-sa-gi!" Luna growled.<p>"What?" She whined.<p>"Your supposed to be looking for signs of the Dark Kingdom, not playing<br/>games and having fun!"<p>"I'm spying, I'm blending and working the room over." Usagi said in her<br/>best James Bond voice. Not very good for a teenage girl though.<p>"Usagi!" Luna hissed. 'Well at least she is trying. If she was wearing a<br/>trench coat and fedora and tiptoeing everywhere I would have to make her<br/>pay.' Luna though.<p>**********<p>Elsewhere a blonde haired girl snuck down an alley and adjusted her trench<br/>coat and glasses. She sneezed and looked around fearfully, the white cat at<br/>her feet shook it's head and cursed under his breath. She looked up and<br/>saw several men on the roof and proved herself to be the worlds best spy.<p>"Thar he blows!" The blonde said to the cat.<p>"That's eureka , Minako!" The cat snapped.<p>"Oh...yeah." Minako giggled and nearly tripped over loose brick and dropped<br/>her spy master 2000 kit. ^^<p>***********<p>There is a sound behind them and Usagi spins around to see a figure<br/>approaching them from the back of the room. She notes absently that they<br/>are in one of the holds, an area she wasn't supposed be. "WHAT are you<br/>doing in here?"<p>"Um...I got separated from my tour group and I took a wrong turn I guess."<br/>Usagi says as she stuffs Luna back in her case.<p>"That's reasonable, I suppose."<p>"Were are we anyway?" Usagi says as she latches onto his arm.<p>"In one of the storage holds." Jedite says as she wonders why he is being<br/>so nice to the girl. As far as he can tell she is mostly normal and a<br/>little plain, nothing to make a big deal about. 'She seems familiar too...'<br/>he thinks.<p>After he shows her around some the ship personally he leads her back to the<br/>main deck. "Miss I should be getting back on duty now, but will you join me<br/>at the Captain's table for dinner tonight?"<p>Usagi squeals. "Sure!"<p>Titus appears behind them and smiles at Usagi in a predatory way, but she<br/>doesn't even notice. "Captain, your needed in the wheel house."<p>"Alright, I'll be there in a few minutes."<p>"Yes sir." Titus says and walks off.<p>"Until tonight then." Jedite says, tips his hat, and walks off.<p>Usagi is just standing there with a weird look on her face and a blush<br/>forming on her face. "Wow..." she breathes out.<p>"Usagi?" Luna says.<p>"The Captain's table..."<p>"Usagi!"<p>"He's so cute!" Usagi squeals and bounce around the deck for a few minutes.<p>"USAGI!" Luna yells, finally getting the love struck girl's<br/>attention.<p>Usagi ducks into a nearby bathroom and opens the case to let the cat out.<br/>"What, I have to decide what to wear tonight."<p>"I had a horrible feeling of dark power the entire time he was with us, he<br/>might be from the Dark Kingdom!"<p>"Oh yeah right!"<p>**********<p>Ranma got up and quickly changed clothes, she wanted to explore the ship<br/>too. It would give her something to do, just to be safe she donned her<br/>bathing suit under her clothes. Now clad in her black pants and a white<br/>shirt, she turned around to look at Ito. Well, where Ito was hanging<br/>actually. The cat had taken the game to far and Ranma had used her shredded<br/>clothing to tie the cat up and hang it from the door in the bathroom. Ito<br/>glared at her.<p>"Serves you right cat, you didn't have to take me leaving you behind so<br/>personally. I figured you wouldn't want to come, we are floating in the<br/>middle of the ocean you know. The largest source of water in the world,<br/>something most cats hate?"<p>Ito glared.<p>"Do you want to come on deck with me or not? You can ride on my shoulder or<br/>something."<p>Ito glared.<p>"Um...heh, um..." Ranma tried again.<p>Ito glared some more.<p>"Fine, your right and I was wrong!" Ranma said, giving into the bad feeling<br/>that was filling her chest.<p>Ito rolled her eyes and glared.<p>"Say something cat!"<p>"Mph mhdk ajdlk!" Ito said though the gag.<p>"Oh Um...heheheheh...sorry about that." Ranma said and took the cat down<br/>and released her.<p>"Your going to pay for that!" Ito snarled, her hair standing up on end.<p>"Oh grow up, you attacked me and lost."<p>"DIE!" Ito pounced again.<p>Ranma was on the ceiling again. "This is getting old, cat." She suddenly<br/>dropped, landed, and flipped over the attacking cat. Ranma smirked as she<br/>landed by the door and dashed into the hallway. The engaged cat ran after<br/>her, but Ranma managed to get the door closed just in time to hear her hit<br/>it head first with a resounding thump.<p>"Gotcha!"<p>She headed down the hall whistling an out of tune ditty before breaking<br/>into a run and heading up a couple of decks. Her stomach was empty and she<br/>needed to fill it quick, luckily the free ticket came with free food too.<br/>That had also been a deciding factor, though one she hadn't mentioned to<br/>Usagi. Sure it was on the ticket, but the blonde had been mooning over this<br/>cruise for days now and she had her head stuck in the clouds. Ranma vaulted<br/>up several flights of stairs, down a hallway, and skidded into the dinning<br/>room.<p>Unfortunately Ranma also tripped over the rug and crashed to the ground<br/>taking out most of the line of people, the host, and several of the waiters<br/>taking food to the tables. The people in line went down like dominos, each<br/>person taking out the person in front of them and so on. Until the final<br/>one falls and the whole group is pilled all over the floor, this in turn<br/>tripped the waiters who sent their food flying. The rest of the room is in<br/>quite shock, but most shrug it off and applaud the floor show.<p>Across the room Rei and Ami are eating dinner and Ami is feeling just a<br/>little embarrassed by the way Rei is acting. There is a small pile of<br/>plates sitting on the table next to Rei as she works on yet another pork<br/>chop in the last hour. "Rei that is your seventh Pork Chop!"<p>"I'm hungry!"<p>"Everyone is staring at us!"<p>"Actually their starring at Ranma, anyway the sea air makes me hungry." Rei<br/>said, downing the last of her food.<p>"..."<p>"We don't have dates and that is why they are really staring. We are to<br/>beautiful girls here alone, looking for love and good looking men."<p>"There are days I worry about you Rei." Ami mumbles.<p>"Huh?"<p>"Nothing, lets go and see if Ranma is alright."<p>"Sure." Rei says, eyeing the rest of Ami's food.<p>They walked over to the pile and helped several of the guests to their<br/>feet, but soon found Ranma at the bottom of the pile. A crew member walked<br/>over to see if everyone was alright and asked the rest of them to relax and<br/>let them deal with this. Then turned and glared at Ranma as she stumbled to<br/>her feet with Ami's help. She shook her head and wasn't able to think fast<br/>enough when the crew member grabbed her arm and gave it a little tug. There<br/>was an evil looking smile in his face as he motioned for one of the others<br/>to open the doors to the room.<p>"Hey, what do you think your doing?" Ranma snapped.<p>"Getting rid of a trouble maker." The crew member said and proceeded to<br/>toss Ranma out of the room.<p>It was with more than a little curiosity the Ranma wondered where they had<br/>found a pair of metal garbage cans to toss her into. After pulling herself<br/>out of the pile of filth, Ranma cleaned herself up as best she could and<br/>ended up wandering around the ship and taking in the sites until she<br/>eventually found herself lost on one of the lower decks. She wondered if<br/>Rei and Ami were okay, but decided that they were fine since they hadn't<br/>been kicked with her.<p>She spotted Usagi as she tagged along on a tour and picked up the Captain<br/>of all people. Who would have thought the blonde teen would have had it in<br/>her? Ranma just grinned and wondered briefly what she was supposed to do<br/>for companionship now that she was stuck in this female form. She had no<br/>interest in men and the mere thought sent chill down her spine. Ranma<br/>shuddered and kicked the though to the back of her mind, tied it up, and<br/>shot it. Repeatedly.<p>She found a wall picture that described the various areas of the ship and<br/>how to get there. After several seconds she found a gym and grinned, it was<br/>full of everything she needed to train and have a little fun. Ranma took<br/>off at a run and was soon zooming through the ship, dodging crew and guests<br/>alike. The gym was several levels up, but with her speed and new abilities<br/>she made the run in record time. She burst through the doors and skidded to<br/>a halt, her head taking in the entire room with huge eyes. It was nearly<br/>forty feet long and two stories high, filled with equipment of all shapes<br/>and sizes.<p>In one corner was a woman using a set of uneven bars while holding her body<br/>in place with her hands and arms while her shapely legs were spread to the<br/>side doing the splits. The girl was quite beautiful and had a perfect set<br/>of curves that went right into Ranma's brain and short circuited it. The<br/>girl had long blue hair, a toned body, and a form fitting body suit that<br/>left no doubt that she was all female. Ranma blinked, blinked again, and<br/>had to grab her nose as blood started to dribble out. Coughing and blushing<br/>she spun around and started to leave, her body was doing things she had<br/>never felt before. They were somewhat familiar, but to out of place to<br/>recognize.<p>"You don't have to leave, I won't bite." Ranma turned around and saw the<br/>girl looking at her while she was doing a hand stand, then seemed to spin<br/>around the bar and dismounted, doing an easy flip and landing on the toes<br/>of her feet easily. She winked at Ranma and bowed.<p>"That was pretty good." Ranma said.<p>"Humph, I'm good enough to be a pro if I wanted."<p>"Maybe, but I could do better." Ranma said with a smirk.<p>"Just who are you to say such a thing." The girl snapped.<p>"Ranma Mazaki."<p>"I"m Captain Tslinka. I know a good number of gymnasts that are at my skill<br/>level and your name has never been mentioned."<p>"I'm not a gymnast, I'm a Martial Artist and those moves are all apart of<br/>my style."<p>"Prove it."<p>Ranma shrugged and sauntered over to the beam. "Anything you want to see?"<p>"Just do what I did."<p>"Easily." Ranma took a second to remember exactly what the girl had been<br/>doing and placed it in her mind. Then with a lazy jump she grabbed the high<br/>bar and swung herself up and swiftly went through the entire thing in<br/>seconds, dismounting and doing a double back flip. Ranma had to use her<br/>will power to keep from making a fool out of herself when certain parts of<br/>her bounced and wiggled in ways she wasn't used to. It was distracting and<br/>a little painful, she kept this to herself and bent back to look at Tslinka<br/>in an amazing amount of dexterity.<p>"Hah!"<p>"Not bad, you've obviously had some training, but I don't think your as<br/>good as me."<p>"That's true, I'm better than you."<p>Tslinka glowered and stared daggers at the arrogant girl in front of her.<br/>She had come down here to get away from those idiots on the ship and what<br/>does she find, a jerk that thought she could possible be better than a high<br/>ranking Youma of Queen Beryl's army. She had spent years learning how to<br/>use her powers in ways that were unheard of and she had to put up with<br/>this. No way. "Yeah right."<p>Tslinka motioned for the girl to follow her and they made their way over to<br/>the mats. "I want you to show you some of my moves girl, these are expert<br/>moves that only the greatest can do." She moved out on to the mat and<br/>stretched a little, failing to see the girl pale and turn red at the same<br/>time. She took her position and went into the hardest thing she knew, doing<br/>rolls, jumps, and dance moves that could make judges jealous with envy, if<br/>there had been any. She went like this for several minutes and kept her<br/>eyes on the red head. To her amazement she didn't see the look of shock or<br/>fear she had expected. No she saw the girl watching her in rapt attention,<br/>her eyes never leaving her body as it moved. Tslinka didn't know how to<br/>handle this, she was used to the Dark Kingdom rules. It was about here that<br/>she would have been in some kind of grudge match, each of them trying to<br/>pull each others hair out, firing blasts of energy to distract or kill<br/>their target.<p>Sure this was the world they were trying to take over, but she had expected<br/>reactions like fear, hate, and jealously. Not awe, wonder, and a glazed<br/>emotion she didn't recognize. She landed in front of Ranma and held her<br/>position for a few seconds. Then relaxed and watched as the girl's eyes<br/>roamed down her body and seemed to be fascinated by something on her chest.<br/>Tslinka, confused, looked down and saw nothing out of the ordinary. "What<br/>is it?"<p>"Um..." Ranma gulped and jerked her head away.<p>"Huh?"<p>"Nothing..."<p>"It's your turn now, show me what you've got."<p>Ranma gulped and tried to decide if she could do what Tslinka had done and<br/>decided that she could mix a number of kata together, but she would need to<br/>have more freedom of movement and that meant she had to take her shirt off.<br/>Like she cared about that, she took off and tossed her shirt to the floor<br/>by Tslinka. She did a few stretches and was glad she had remembered to put<br/>on her bating suit when she left. Once she was ready she launched into a<br/>mobile kata that used twists and turns, flips and kicks, and other violent<br/>movements to take out an opponent. Then she altered the kata subtlety and<br/>was soon moving across the mat with a grace that made Tslinka look like an<br/>armature.<p>It also had her feeling funny, but she wouldn't mention that to anyone, no<br/>way in hell. She gaped as this red headed girl put her best moves to shame<br/>with jumps and spins she had never seen before. It was a humbling<br/>experience and one she didn't like, she was a powerful and intelligent<br/>Youma and this human was far better than she could ever hope to be. She<br/>almost burst into tears, but that was swiftly replaced by a rage that<br/>consumed her. Tslinka nearly attacked Ranma then and there, but held her<br/>ground. The girl was doing martial arts moves to beat her and that meant<br/>she was probably one of the best fighters in the area. Tslinka's rage<br/>turned to cold fury, even she didn't know if she could take a girl that was<br/>this good. Jedite or Kunzite could do it and she was probably full of all<br/>the life energy they would need. She was the perfect target, like a well<br/>trained battery that just had to be tamed.<p>"Ha, I knew I could do it!" Ranma crowed as she jumped around happily.<p>"I have to admit, you are quite good, but not good enough to beat me<br/>human." Tslinka said.<p>Ranma stopped dead and turned to look the girl over. "Huh?"<p>Tslinka stepped back and her body changed. Her body took on a watery look<br/>to it, her hair turned even more blue and her face except for her eyes<br/>vanished into smooth skin. There was no mouth, nose, or anything else of<br/>interest, just eyes glowing in rage. An aura of power formed around and<br/>fired off a stream of water. Ranma eeped and dropped the ground and rolled<br/>out of the way. The water blasted a large dent in the steel walls of the<br/>room and sent a shudder through the floor.<p>"What the heck is up with you, I just wanted to have a little fun?"<p>"THIS IS FUN!"<p>"Come on? I just wanted to relax a little, not fight for my life!" Ranma<br/>yelled. She knew this was a Youma, one of those things that she had fought<br/>the other day, but she wasn't getting the dark feelings from this one that<br/>she had from them. She came to her feet and took a defensive stance. "I<br/>don't want to fight you."<p>"Your energy could be enough to free my Master, give it to me now!" Titus<br/>yelled. "I am Titus, a Higher Youma and your worst nightmare human."<p>"Like I haven't heard that before." Ranma muttered. This situation felt<br/>wrong to her, as if she wasn't supposed to be fighting this thing. Why she<br/>felt this way was a mystery, but it was enough to make her hesitate just<br/>enough to leave herself open to attack. Titus used it and sent a blast of<br/>water into Ranma and sent her flying back into a wall with a loud thud. She<br/>slid to the floor groaning in pain and winced as Titus hit her with more<br/>water, sending her off the floor and into the ceiling hard crack it. That<br/>didn't stop Ranma, but it did slow her down as she landed on her feet and<br/>shook her head. This fight was going weird, she was second guessing herself<br/>and didn't know why. A large part of her mind was torn and didn't want to<br/>hurt the thing attacking her and she didn't understand why.<p>A small part of her had other ideas and these she agreed with since it<br/>meant she had a chance to fight back. Ranma ignored her instincts and shot<br/>forward to attack Waverider or Waffer or whatever it had called itself. Her<br/>attack took the thing by surprise, unfortunately since she was made of<br/>water the attack was useless. Ranma came in punching for all of her vital<br/>spots, hr hands moving in a blur of speed and power. Titus ignored the<br/>fists slamming into the surface tension of her body, it had been a long<br/>time since she had been attacked physically. It was an advantage she had<br/>always had, what kind of physical attack could hurt water? She flowed and<br/>twisted her arm to send out a cascade of water that enveloped Ranma in a<br/>jello like substance, pinning her in place.<p>Then Titus used the stuff to pound the stuffing out of Ranma's body. Solid<br/>bars of water started to slam inwards to hit her in the stomach and back,<br/>in the legs and breasts. Titus kept this up for several seconds and laughed<br/>to herself at the effectiveness of the attack she hadn't had a chance to<br/>test yet, it seemed to be a great success. Then she noticed something, the<br/>red head was glowing a bright red/black that was pushing against the jello.<br/>Then Ranma screamed and the aura flared out in an explosion of power that<br/>blasted Titus back several feet and sent bits of the deck into deck heaven.<br/>Ranma was hovering in the air, her hair waving back and fourth a she looked<br/>up, her eyes closed. The eyes that opened were not Ranma's normal bright<br/>blue, but searing green that glowed with deadly intent.<p>"That is enough!" Ranma yelled.<p>Her aura flared up even more and her aura turned a deep red color and she<br/>glared at Titus as she pulled herself to her feet. Ranma's foot hit the<br/>deck plating and she launched forward, her aura flaring yet again, and<br/>slammed into the Youma with the force of a violent storm. Punches and kicks<br/>came at her from all directions as Ranma moved so fast that she left behind<br/>after images. Not that she noticed, she was to angry with the beating she<br/>had been taking just because she didn't want to injure the girl she had<br/>been competing against. Look where it had gotten her, she wondered where<br/>all these monsters had come from and why they were so insistent on using<br/>her as a punching bag.<p>Using a final move, Ranma did a back kick and ended up shoving her foot<br/>through Titus' body. Ranma froze in shock, she hadn't meant to that. Then<br/>Titus seemed to reform and grabbed her leg and lifted Ranma into the air<br/>while she was frozen in place and slammed her into the floor like a hammer.<br/>Ranma cried out in pain as she felt her arm get dislocated from the blow,<br/>then screamed in shock as Titus tossed her into the wall.<p>"Die you little pest, I'll drain all your energy and add it to my own to<br/>make myself more powerful than even Jedite ever was!" Titus yelled.<p>She raised her arm and snarled in anger, a dark blue aura sprang up around<br/>her and spread out throughout the room, making the floor glow for several<br/>seconds. Then several monsters pulled themselves up off the floor, where<br/>they came from was a complete mystery to Ranma as she forced her eyes open.<br/>They were humanoid, but had no distinctive markings, just a kind of rust<br/>brown colored skin of some kind. They had no eyes, no mouth, nothing to<br/>define them as beings.<p>"Go my minions, kill the red headed girl!" Titus yelled and pointed at<br/>Ranma as she took a defensive stance and hissed in pain.<p>"Oh great, this all I need." Ranma muttered. Her aura sprang forth, though<br/>it didn't have the amount of power that the one from earlier had. That had<br/>been fueled by her fear and anger, neither of which she was feeling now.<br/>Instead she was beginning to smirk at the odds being placed against her.<br/>She was outnumbered, she was outclassed, and she was at a disadvantage<br/>against this powerful Youma. This was her kind of odds.<p>"Bring it on lady."<p>The things surged forward by the dozen, there was no form or tactics in how<br/>they attacked. They were just trying to overwhelm her with sheer numbers,<br/>Ranma just grinned and plowed right into them using a technique she hadn't<br/>mastered yet. The monsters were like a solid mass of some material, she<br/>could see the lines and points she needed to use the technique and just<br/>smirked at Titus as she closed in. Ranma's hands blurred as they lashed out<br/>at each of the attacking things.<p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!"<p>Boooooom!<p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!"<p>Boooooom!<p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!"<p>BOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM!<p>Titus's eyes went wide as her lower Youma started to explode as if they had<br/>been covered in explosives. The dived to the floor as the explosions rocked<br/>the entire deck and left holes in the floor and walls. The lower Youma<br/>screamed in shock and sent convulsions through her as they died and were<br/>severed from her control. She rolled away and wondered what she had taken<br/>on, this girl wasn't human. Human's were weak things, barely even dangerous<br/>to be around and far to easy to kill. The perfect food and energy source<br/>for the might Dark Kingdom, this girl was a warrior of amazing skill. No<br/>wonder Jedite had wanted her to be watched and taken out quietly when they<br/>boarded.<p>The entire area was filled with smoke and dust as it swirled through the<br/>air, Titus froze in shock as the last of her followers were taken and<br/>silence descended on the area. She looks into the devastation and gapes as<br/>a bright white light seems to fill it for a second and nearly blinds her.<br/>Then a shadow makes itself known as it walks towards her, the aura of red<br/>power easily visible around it as it moves. The form of a Scout steps out<br/>of the smoke and Titus knows that this is the red head she had been<br/>fighting, those deadly green eyes were staring at her and sent a chill down<br/>her spine.<p>"W-what is y-your name..." Titus gasps out.<p>"I don't have one yet, but you may call me what I told Blondie to call me.<br/>I am Ranko."<p>"I am a Higher Youma, I will not back down." Titus said.<p>"At the moment I don't really care. You started this, but I am going to<br/>finish it and put you down." Ranko says and flares her aura and melts some<br/>of the deck plates around her and starts some of the mats on fire.<p>Titus gulps and nods, accepting her fate, though she would be damned if she<br/>let this little girl take her down as if it was nothing. She flipped back<br/>and landed, glaring at Ranko, then launched herself into the air and<br/>through the metal ceiling of the room. Ranko snarled and followed her<br/>through the hole she had made, landing on the next deck up. She spotted the<br/>Youma running down the hallway and took off after her.<p>"Get back here coward!" Ranko yelled.<p>Then there was a shudder that went though the entire ship and knocked a<br/>good portion of the guests off there feet, even tossed a couple over board.<br/>Ranko growled as she sensed the build up of something up on the main deck,<br/>right where Titus was leading her. Usagi, Rei, and Ami also felt it and<br/>gasped as they recognized it for what it was. Rei and Ami were still in the<br/>dinning room finishing off their dinner before heading to the main ball<br/>room. Ami had her computer out and scanning the entire ship.<p>"What is it Ami?" Rei asked.<p>"I don't know, I had the computer turned off since we were on vacation,<br/>give me a sec."<p>"Hurry, I've got this weird feeling."<p>"Here we go...there had been a massive power surge a few decks below. I've<br/>got readings on the Dark Kingdom energies and Silver Millennium energies<br/>clashing a few minutes ago. I've got detections of a very powerful Youma as<br/>well, currently moving away from the Silver Millennium target."<p>"What about the ship?"<p>"Scanning...we've come to an emergency stop. There is another massive build<br/>up of power just a little ways from here."<p>Rei groaned. "Why is it that where ever we go lately, those idiots keep<br/>showing up?"<p>"Come on Rei, we have to do something."<p>"Lets prove to Meatball Head just what we can do!" Rei said with a snarl.<p>Ami just shook her head and made her way out of the dinning room, she was<br/>still a little amazed that most of the passengers hadn't turned into a<br/>panicked mob yet. If she had spent a few minutes with her computer she<br/>would have found a strange energy flooding the entire ship. Her and Rei<br/>moved out into the hall just as a Titus ran by them, closely followed by a<br/>Scout they had never met before. She was little taller than they were and<br/>glowing with energy as she ran. She spotted Rei and Ami and yelled at them<br/>as she flew past.<p>"Mercury, Mars, move your butts and give me a hand, we have to stop them<br/>before anything major happens!" Then she was gone and Ami and Rei were<br/>pulling themselves up from their dual face fault into the floor.<p>"How did she know?"<p>"Worry about it later, she needs a hand!" Usagi yelled a she ran past still<br/>disguised as a photographer. She skidded around the corner, slammed into<br/>the wall, and followed the new Scout.<p>Getting up from yet another dual face plant, Rei growls and takes off after<br/>Usagi to get some answers. Ami is a little slower to get up, but is in the<br/>perfect position to witness the sight of the Dark Kingdom plan as it goes<br/>into action. A wave of dark energy lights up the all the lighting fixtures<br/>on the ship and begin to suck the humans dry. Ami, as a Scout is able to<br/>keep from being drained, but that isn't so for the normal human's around<br/>her. They dropped like flies and she was soon surrounded by the drained<br/>victims of the all the guests. She gasped at the speed at which it had<br/>happened and took off after Rei and Usagi.<p>**********<p>Titus ran up on deck and made her way over to the pool, she hadn't even<br/>stopped running when she tapped her powers again. Twin beams of power fired<br/>out of her eyes and hit the pool as she slowed to a stop. Behind her Ranko<br/>ran out on deck and noticed that her enemy had stopped, she made her way<br/>over slowly making sure to take in all of the different kind of hazards<br/>around her.<p>"I will stop you." Ranko said.<p>"It is already to late idiot, we made our move while you were chasing me<br/>through the ship."<p>"Then I will reverse whatever it was you did."<p>"Ha!" Titus crowed. She had a mental link with Jedite for this operation,<br/>they couldn't talk to each other, but they did know what the other was<br/>doing at any one time. She brought her arms up and twin columns of water<br/>rise up out of the pool behind her and she begins to glow with dark power<br/>as she taps into the collected energy around the ship. "You are far to late<br/>little girl, you may have been able to stop me before, but now I have more<br/>power at my finger tips than even you can stand up to!"<p>"She has help Youma!" Mars and Moon yell as they flank Ranko.<p>Titus just laughs, the water behind her was beginning to alter in some<br/>indefinable way as it rose up into the sky. Then she brought her arms down<br/>and the columns twist and arc over their head and begin to fall. Aiming<br/>right for Ranko. "You are dead idiots, we have won."<p>"Don't gloat Titus, just finish them off, NOW!" Jedite yells as she hovers<br/>over the fight and watches the battle.<p>"Of course General Jedite!"<p>The water columns slam into the deck just as Ranko, Mars, and Moon jump out<br/>of the way. The water plows into the wooden deck and rips it to shards in<br/>seconds. Ranko lands on a nearby and flared and fired. "Möko Takabisha!"<br/>Titus is hit point blank and blasted into the side of the now empty pool,<br/>shattering a good portion of the pool tile.<p>Moon and Mars landed on top of nearby roof and fired, not at Titus, but at<br/>Jedite. "Fire Soul! Moon Tiara Action!" The attacks though surprising,<br/>didn't catch him off guard and he had time to throw up a shield and laughed<br/>as the power washed around him. He hovered down a little and took a closer<br/>look at Moon and Mars and just smirked. He lashed out and fired out a blast<br/>of energy that slammed into the deck housing they were standing on. They<br/>had time to jump just as it went, Moon grabbed her Tiara again and threw it<br/>in mid jump and grinned as Jedite was sliced across his arm.<p>"Shit!"<p>Titus turned to water and flowed out of the pool and reformed herself just<br/>as Ranko was about to reach her. Titus tapped into the stored energy again<br/>and fired, Ranko dropped and dodged, at a loss at how to stop the Youma.<br/>Then looks up and sees a life saver as Mercury lands behind Titus and<br/>motions for Ranko to prepare herself. Then fills the entire deck with a<br/>thick fog and Ranko goes into action as Mercury tossed a fire extinguisher.<br/>Ranma grabs it out of the air and lands just as Titus is at the height of<br/>the confusion created by Mercury's fog magic.<p>"What the heck is going on, where did everything go?" Titus yelled.<p>Ranko landed and fired the fire extinguisher and soon had Titus hosed down<br/>into a nearly solid mass. She wasn't capable of moving as fast anymore, the<br/>confusion of the Mercury's attack is limited so she had to work fast. Ranko<br/>fires out another "Möko Takabisha!" and Titus screams in pain.<p>Up above Jedite wasn't having a good time of it, his initial attack had<br/>been executed perfectly, unfortunately the Scouts had dodged it easily.<br/>Then he had gotten hit by Moon's attack his luck had gone down hill from<br/>there. Now he was facing off against Mars and dodging like crazy, how she<br/>was firing so fast was amazing in itself since her first attack had taken a<br/>second to power up. Now she was just firing off attacks with barely a<br/>second of time to concentrate. His shield was being pushed to its limits.<p>"Moon Tiara Action!" Moon yelled and threw her attack again. It soared out<br/>and arced right for Jedite, but he took a second to knock the thing away<br/>like it was nothing. Though it did slash right across Jedite's hand, be he<br/>ignored it as another of Mar's fire attacks slammed into his shield again.<br/>Jedite and snarled and wandered where Moon was getting the power to send<br/>her stupid tiara through his shield like it was nothing. Then he heard<br/>something he had been dreading and expecting, Titus' scream of pain.<p>He spun around just in time to see through the fog as that red headed girl<br/>fired her blast right into Titus' chest and paled as Moon's tiara, the one<br/>he had just knocked away, sliced right through Titus' body and made her<br/>scream one of death. Jedite gaped as he watched Titus' body turn to dust<br/>and slowly disintegrate and vanish. She had been one of the most powerful<br/>Youma in the last few generations and had only been a few steps below his<br/>position and one of the one's Beryl had been watching with interest.<p>"This isn't good..." Jedite mumbled, just as Mars, Moon, and Ranko focused<br/>on him totally and fired. He barely had time to bring his shield up again<br/>and he was blasted out of the air and through what was left of a nearby<br/>deck wall. He groans as he rolls to his feet and finds all four Scouts<br/>standing there watching him, all of them are decidedly ticked off.<p>"Time to pay Jedite."<p>"You can't stop me, this is only the beginning of what I am going to bring<br/>to you." Jedite snarls and starts to power up.<p>"There are four of us and one of you Jedite, you are going down." Ranko<br/>says.<p>"It is time for you to pay for what you have done to this city Jedite."<br/>Mars says and a red aura forms around her.<p>Jedite flings his arm forward and a burst of power is about to fire off his<br/>hand when a black aura forms around him and he vanishes from sight. The<br/>Scouts gasp and go into a defensive ring in case Jedite is trying to<br/>confuse them, but he seems to be completely gone. Ranko relaxes and looks<br/>around a little more carefully as Mercury pulls out her computer and scans<br/>the ship.<p>"Anything Mercury?" Moon asks as she relaxes.<p>"About 40 percent of all the energy collected is returning to the victims.<br/>Titus seems to have used to the other 60 percent up during the fight."<p>"Is everyone going to be alright?" Ranko asks.<p>"Yes, but if we had been any longer most of the victims would have been<br/>hospitalized for months as they recovered from being drained. This way it<br/>is like they had run an extended marathon."<p>"At least they are safe." Moon said.<p>"What's this...oh my." Mercury said.<p>"What is it?" The others asked.<p>The cruise ship shudders and a kind of wavering of the air covers the<br/>entire ship for several seconds then changes before their shocked eyes.<br/>Turning into a giant rusting heap of scrap metal that is beginning to bob<br/>dangerously in the water. Ranko and the others just stand there and gape in<br/>shock at the change and wonder how such a thing could have happened. This<br/>was the first time anything like this had ever happened too, they had no<br/>clue what to do about it. Though Mercury seemed to make a quick decision as<br/>she typed on her little computer.<p>"What do we do now?" Mars asked.<p>"I just contacted the Coast Guard with my computer, they should be here<br/>within the hour." Mercury said smugly.<p>"Will one of you explain what your doing here?" Mars asked louldly, glaring<br/>at Moon.<p>"Um...heheheh..." Moon said.<p>Ranko de-transformed into Ranma and smirked at the shocked looks on Mars<br/>and Mercury's faces. "I brought Usagi along when she said she had to be<br/>here."<p>"Ranma?" Mars gasped out.<p>"What?" She asked innocently.<p>"Ranma?" Mars said again, as if Ranma was her worst enemy or something.<p>"I know, I know I'm your idle and you want my autograph since I'm the best<br/>after all."<p>"What? Come back here you arrogant little..."<p>Moon and Mercury giggled as Ranma ran past with Mars right on her tail.<p>Meanwhile Luna and Ito are up to their ears in various kinds of food and<br/>snakes down in the dinning room. Surprisingly the food had been real and<br/>was the perfect place for the two of them to have a little chat together.<br/>Though chowing down on caviar and pate wasn't exactly a meeting of any<br/>kind, just a good way to get some free eats. They were cats after all.<br/>Though if a certain white cat had been there it would have been an entirely<br/>different story.<p>**********<p>To Be Continued...
