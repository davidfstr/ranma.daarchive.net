</div><p>Chapter 3 School Daze</p><p>The next morning, Ranma woke up to  the sound of Akane's voice.  "Ranma,  breakfast is ready," she was saying as she shook him.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and gazed at  her sleepily for a second.  'She's  pretty cute', he thought, 'This is a much nicer way of waking up than Pop  throwing me out of bed.'</p><p>"Thanks, Akane," he said, after a  second, shaking the cobwebs out of his head.   "I'll be down in a second, once I throw some clothes on.  Don't let Pop eat everything in sight."</p><p>Akane smiled in acknowledgement,  remembering what had happened the evening before.</p><p>Flashback</p><p>Gemna had attempted to steal the  food off of Ranma's plate.  Kasumi had  simply reached over, swatted his hand with her chopsticks, and removed Gemna's  plate.  "I told you we weren't going to  have any fights in the house.  If you  don't stop trying to steal Ranma's food, then I'll stop fixing you meals," she  said sweetly.  Gemna's face paled, and  he apologized.</p><p>"Oh, My!" said Nabiki.  'Did I just say that, well I guess someone  had to,' she thought.  Akane sat there  stunned.</p><p>Ranma convulsed in silent  laughter.  'Way to go, Kasumi,' he  thought.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>Akane left the room.  Ranma got up, and changed into clean  clothes.  He left the guestroom and  walked downstairs to the dining area.   Soun was sitting at one end of the dining platform, Kasumi sitting  opposite him.  Akane sat down next to  her father; Ranma sat between her and Kasumi, and opposite Nabiki.  Gemna came in from outside and sat down in the  remaining space, between Soun and Nabiki.</p><p>Kasumi handed the plates of food  around and everyone began to eat, Gemna devouring everything in sight at warp  speed.  Ranma was copying his behavior,  until Nabiki said sharply, "Why don't you at least taste it as it's going  in?"  Ranma looked abashed and slowed  down.</p><p>Ranma looked surprised, and then  said, "You're right Nabiki, thanks, this is entirely too good not to  taste.  I didn't know what I was  missing.  Kasumi, you are an excellent  cook."  Kasumi blushed, and then nodded  her thanks.</p><p>"Come on, Ranma, we'll be late if  you don't hurry!" Akane said.</p><p>He looked up, just in time to see a  backpack heading toward him.  He grabbed  it, put it on, and got ready to leave.   Remembering his manners, however, he turned to Kasumi, bowed and said,  "Thank you for preparing such a nice meal."   Gemna face faulted.  Ranma turned  and followed Akane and Nabiki out the door.</p><p>Ranma was walking with Akane, when  suddenly an old lady watering her flowers splashed him.  Akane just groaned, and said, "What are you,  some kind of water magnet?  Come on, I  know where we can get some hot water to change you back."  Ranma just shrugged and followed her to a small  clinic on the way to school.  She  followed Akane in to the clinic's reception room.  She was looking around, wondering who worked here, when suddenly  she felt a bony hand on her shoulder.</p><p>A voice from behind her said,  "Don't mind Betty, she's just trying to be friendly." Ranma turned and  looked.  She saw a young man, in his  early thirties, or late twenties, in a lab coat, holding a skeleton.  The skeleton's hand was what she had felt.</p><p>"This is Ranma Saotome, she is  staying with us for a while.  Ranma this  is Dr. Tofu," Akane gushed.  Ranma  looked at the girl, while she wasn't sure, it sure sounded like Akane had a  crush on the young doctor.</p><p>"Ranma, pleased to meet you.  You're an extremely attractive young girl,"  Tofu said.  Ranma winced.</p><p>"Doctor, do you have any hot water  available?" Akane asked quickly.  Tofu  nodded, went into a back room and came out with a small teakettle.  Ranma took it from him, poured the water  over herself, and triggered the change.   Tofu's eyes got very wide, and he had a major face fault.  "I'll explain later, right now we need to  get to school," Akane said, "Thanks."   Ranma nodded.  Akane pulled him  out the door, heading toward the gates of the school.</p><p>"What's up with the doctor?  Ya know, he's a pretty good martial artist,"  he asked.</p><p>"How could you tell?" she asked in  some surprise.</p><p>"Yeah, he has good control or else  I would have sensed him," he replied, "So he's the guy that Kasumi likes?"</p><p>"Yes, she likes him," she said, a  little sadly.</p><p>"Ya like him too, don't ya," Ranma  said.</p><p>She blushed.  "He's been our doctor for a long time.  Every time I got hurt, I would go to him and  he would make it better, so yeah, I have a bit of a crush on him," she  admitted.</p><p>"I thought you didn't like guys,"  Ranma teased.</p><p>Her eyes flashed.  "No, I just don't like boys!" she exclaimed  angrily.</p><p>As she got closer to the gates, and  started saying, almost like a mantra, "I hate boys!  I hate boys!"  She pulled  away from him and entered the schoolyard.   He began hearing the sounds of combat from the behind the walls.  As he entered the gates, he saw what looked  like the entire male student population of the school stretched out in pain all  over the yard.  As he watched, Akane  finished knocking out the remaining boys.   'Nice form; actually, for group combat.   I can see why she has a poor opinion of boys," he thought.  He remembered then what Nabiki had said  yesterday about the Hentaii Horde, and the little speech she had written for  him to memorize.  He hoped it worked.</p><p>As he walked toward Akane, a rose  came flying out from behind a tree.  She  caught it, dropped it on the ground, and crushed it beneath her foot.  A figure in flowing robes, carrying a  bokken, stepped out from behind the tree.   "Ah, the fair Akane Tendo, I see your love for me is still as strong as  ever," the figure said.</p><p>Akane screamed at him, "I don't  love you Kuno, I will never date you!   Leave me alone!"</p><p>Ranma interrupted Akane, as she was  about to attack Kuno.  "Akane, may I  handle this please?" he asked pleasantly.   She glared at him angrily for a moment, and then nodded.  Stepping between Akane and Kuno, Ranma asked  with a smile, "It appears the lady does not return your affection.  It also appears that you are beginning to  annoy her.  I see by your robes that you  consider yourself a Samurai.  Men of  honor, such as you seem to be, would certainly not force their attention where  it is unwanted.  I would ask that you  honor her request to leave her alone."   Ranma was proud that he had managed to get through all of Nabiki's  speech without stumbling.  'Ugh if I  have to talk much more like that, I'm gonna need to wash out my mouth,' he  thought.</p><p>"Peasant, how dare you  interrupt,   but pardon, it is not right  for this to continue without introducing myself.  I have the honor and privilege to be Tatewaki Kuno, upperclassman,  the Rising Star of Furinkan High, the undefeated champion, also known as the  Blue Thunder."  As he finished talking,  thunder roared in the background.</p><p>"Nice special effects," Ranma  smirked.  "I am Ranma Saotome, of the  School of Anything Goes Martial Arts.   I'm one of the new senseis at the Tendo School.  You must be the pompous fool who came up  with the idea of the male students having to beat Akane in order to ask her for  a date.  That is the stupidest thing  that I have ever heard of.  I don't know  much about women, but even I know that's not how you impress a girl.  If you want to ask a girl out, you do it  like " Ranma said evenly.</p><p>Kuno interrupted, "Ill mannered  oaf, only I may determine who may date Akane, you do not have that right!"  Akane began seething in anger.</p><p>"I believe you are wrong there on both  counts.  Akane alone makes that  decision.  And anyway, according to your  own stupid rule, I can ask her for a date.   After all, I beat her in a fight yesterday, what was it Akane, three  times out of five, I think," he said with a wink to Akane, hoping she would  play along. 'After all, they don't have to know it was shogi,' he thought.  Akane glared at him, but then she remembered  what he was doing.</p><p>"Yes, that's right, Ranma, you beat  me three times out of five," Akane said with a thin smile.  Then she screamed, "Ranma, watch out!" as  Kuno attacked, swinging his bokken.   Ranma snatched it out of his hand, spun it around and broke it into four  pieces.  He then proceeded to dance  around Kuno, touching all of his pressure points and paralyzing him without getting  hit in the process.  Finally, Kuno fell  to the ground.  Ranma thought, 'Now that  wasn't much of a fight, I guess he's not much without his bokken.'</p><p>"Kuno, do you yield?" Ranma spat  through clenched teeth, trying to keep his temper under control.</p><p>Kuno attempted to stand, but fell  back onto the ground.  He nodded and  said, "Yes, your foul sorcery has bested me."</p><p>"It wasn't sorcery, it was skill,  you dishonorable cur.  Attacking from  behind, I thought a Samurai was better than that, you are not worthy of the  uniform you wear," Ranma growled.  Then  turning to Akane, he asked, " Now, as I was saying before I was so rudely  interrupted.  Akane, I like you, I think  you're cute.  Would you care to go out  with me Friday night?"</p><p>Akane thought for a long second,  and then replied, "No, I wouldn't."   Ranma's face fell.  She waited  for a long pause.  "However, I believe  Saturday would be good," she said with a giggle.</p><p>He mouthed the words "Thanks" to  her, and then turned to the mass of bodies on the ground.  He said, "See that is how a honorable man  asks a woman out.  Now, Akane, is there  anything else we need to discuss with these gentlemen?"</p><p>She smiled a shark-like grin.  "Yes, there is.  I am tired of having to fight all of you every morning.  If you don't stop, Ranma and I will have to  start taking shall we say stronger measures.   Kuno was selling something that he didn't have to offer.  As Ranma said, I decide whom I will date.  And it won't be any of you.  Why don't you take a look at all of the cute  girls around school?  You might find one  you like that likes you as well."</p><p>Ranma smiled.  "You heard the lady, gentlemen.  Oh by the way, Akane is the other sensei for  the Tendo dojo.  I intend to teach her  all my skills, so you might want to consider that.  We'd better run so we're not late, Akane."  They ran into the school and up the stairs  to their third floor classroom, just beating the bell.</p><p>Nabiki watched the entire scene  from the second story window.  'Way to  go, Ranma, you did remember everything I told you.  This might have just worked," she thought with a smirk.</p><p>"Class, we have a new student  joining us.  His name is Ranma Saotome,  he just came back from China," said the teacher, "Can you tell us anymore about  yourself?"</p><p>"Hai, sensei.  Uh, I'm a martial artist.  My Pop is a friend of Mr. Tendo and we are  staying there for a while.  We are also  reopening the Tendo dojo for students, if any of you are interested."</p><p>"Thank you, now since you know Miss  Tendo, why don't you take the empty seat next to her?" the teacher said.  Ranma bowed, then went and sat beside  Akane.  He started listening to the  lecture, unfortunately, this was algebra, and his grasp of math, was to say at  best, shaky, so he soon found himself not paying attention.  Shortly, he woke up after being hit on the  head by an eraser, thrown at him by the teacher.  Soon he found himself outside in the hall, holding two pails of  water, which he was eying nervously.</p><p>Suddenly, Kuno came charging at  him, yelling, "How dare you date the beautiful Akane Tendo!"</p><p>Ranma dropped his buckets, ducked  out of the way, and said, "This is not the appropriate place to fight, follow  me," as he ran down the hall.  Heads  popped out of every classroom trying to see what was going on.  Kuno followed him down the hall, Akane and  her class close behind.  Ranma jumped  out the window, Kuno hesitated for a second and followed.</p><p>Akane gasped, "This is the third  floor," as she rushed over to the window.</p><p>Ranma looked below his and  cursed.  'Just my luck, there's a  swimming pool below me.'  He fell into  the water and transformed.  Shortly  thereafter, she felt the impact as Kuno fell into the water too.  He landed somewhat awkwardly and started  sinking to the bottom of the pool.   Ranma swam down to him, and grabbed him and began pulling him over to  the side.  She got out, and pulled Kuno  from the pool.  Then she ran off.</p><p>Above, the students were  watching.  One of them said, "There's  Ranma and Kuno now.  But isn't Ranma's  hair a lot redder than it was?"  Everyone  looked puzzled.  Akane ran downstairs,  grabbing a kettle of hot water and a towel from the nurses' office as she  passed by it.  She ran outside looking  for Ranma.  She finally found her up in  a tree, trying to wring the water out of her clothes.  Ranma saw Akane, jumped down from the tree, and poured the water  over her.</p><p>"Thanks, Akane, you're a  lifesaver," Ranma said as he dried himself off, "Next time I'll know about the  pool."</p><p>"You're welcome, Ranma," Akane  said, "Here's your bento.  It's time for  lunch, anyway.  We can sit and eat out  here if you want."  Ranma nodded, they  sat down and began eating.  "Ranma, do  you really think we did anything this morning?" Akane asked finally.</p><p>"I don't know.  I hope  so.  All we can do is see what happens  tomorrow," Ranma said, "I doubt we chased Kuno away.  You're right about him, by the way; he is a pervert.  His hands were all over me as I was dragging  him out of the pool.  I guess the only  thing we accomplished this morning is that we got a date out of it, that is if  you were really want to go.  We can just  say we did if'n ya want.  I know ya  don't think much of boys."</p><p>"I think I do if you want to.  I'm kinda looking forward to it; you're  different from the others.  We'll really  have to play it down with our parents," Akane said.</p><p>"Yeah, I know.  If we look like we're too friendly, they'd  have us engaged before we could blink, and married the day after," Ranma said  with a wry smile, "Even in spite of the contract they signed with us."</p><p>Akane sighed.  "Yeah, I know.  I still mad at him for the stupid engagement idea.  How do you plan on fooling them?"</p><p>"I could tell them it was a reward  for doing well in training, that we're going out as sensei and student, I  suppose, but you're going to have to tell me what you want to do and where you  want to go.  I don't have any idea of  what's fun to do around here," he said with a laugh.</p><p>"Ranma, Akane, there you are,"  Nabiki said as she sat down next to them.   "That was a pretty profitable morning for the family finances.  Everyone sure wanted to pay a lot to know  about you.  I hope you don't mind too  much about that.  I didn't say anything  about the engagement or Jusenkyo.  I  also made a killing on the fight this morning.   We do have a little problem, though.   I took Kuno to the nurses' office after you dragged him out of the  pool.  He was asking about a red-haired,  pig-tailed goddess.  I told him I didn't  know anyone like that," she smirked.  "I  don't know any goddesses, do you Ranma?" she said with a laugh.</p><p>Ranma just smirked, Akane  giggled.  "Obviously, I don't want  anyone to know about that.  Why don't  you just tell him you're not having any luck finding out anything about her for  a while?" Ranma said.</p><p>"We can probably milk that for  about a week before I have to come up with something else.  Are you two serious about the date  Saturday?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Yeah, we are, it'll just be as friends  though.  The only way I'll get to know  each of you is to do things with you, though I hadn't really planned to start  so soon.  It kinda just happened, ya  know?  Actually, since you planned my  speech, you probably do know," Ranma answered.   "Something else I just figured out, I haven't had much formal education,  but I tried to read everything I could get my hands on.  I didn't understand much of what was going  on in class today, though.  I just  didn't have enough background to follow much of what the teachers were  saying.  I need to ask you two for help  if I want to pass."</p><p>Nabiki thought for a second, "Akane  can probably help you with studying.  I  can pitch in some, though I don't know how much time I will have and don't  underestimate Kasumi."  She sat there  deep in thought for a while, and then asked, "Hm, tell me Ranma, how easy do  you pick up martial art techniques?"</p><p>After a few minutes, Ranma said, "Pretty  quickly.  I can usually watch someone  for a while and pick up on what he is doing real fast.  That's why I never lose"</p><p>"Never lose, huh.  That's what I thought, you aren't a dumb  jock; you just need a focus.  Therefore  I challenge you to pay attention in class and learn the material.  All good martial artists need a good  education," Nabiki said.</p><p>"Damn, you're good, Nabiki, using  my own conceit and pride against me like that," Ranma laughed, "I accept, I  never turn down a challenge.  Maybe  that's really the secret; I need to treat school as just another martial art  skill.  If it's martial arts, I can do  it.  So here's to learning the art of  Martial Arts Education."</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>I want to thank all of you who have reviewed this  piece.  I certainly appreciate all of  the comments.</p><p>Remember, Ranma is going to be a bit o-o-c in this.  He does come across as a bit more  intelligent than I had originally intended, though I think a martial artist of  his caliber really can't be a dumb jock.</p><p>In the first episode, which roughly corresponds to my first  two chapters, Akane didn't really show a lot of anger except when she walked in  on Ranma in the furo, and then when she was selected as the fiancée.  I removed both of those issues deliberately  in those chapters, so she does come across a bit passive.  I think this chapter brings her back more in  character.  As to her not liking boys,  that's still true, but since so far Ranma is being reasonably polite to her, he  should come across as more mature.</p><p>I also haven't really resolved any thing about Ranma's  problem as far as the engagement is concerned.   Remember, right now he is effectively engaged to all three of the girls.</p><p>Again, thanks for reading and reviewing.  I hope you continue to like how this turns  out.</p>
