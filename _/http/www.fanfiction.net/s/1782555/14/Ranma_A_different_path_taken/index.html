</div><p>Author's Note: This is a repost of  this chapter.  I have corrected a couple  of typo's.  Also, my thanks to Doctor  Emmit Brown for catching how OOC that opening scene was.  It was supposed to be in an earlier chapter,  where it would have made more sense the way it was originally written.  However, that would have introduced Shampoo  too soon, so I moved it.</p><p>Chapter 14 The Amazons</p><p>Lunchtime at Furinkan High School  found Ranma and Akane sitting outside, eating their lunches.  Ranma was being unusually quiet today; he  didn't insult his father at breakfast this morning, he hadn't reacted to her  teasing, and she was beginning to get concerned.  There was a certain rhythm to their relationship, starting with  them teasing each other at breakfast, followed by her chasing him to  school.  He had managed to stay awake  completely in class, and even contribute to the lesson discussion.  It must be the coming of the Apocalypse.  She looked at Ranma; he appeared to be  worried about something.  "Ranma what's going  on?  You're not acting like you do  normally?" she asked with concern.</p><p>"I'm not sure, Akane," he said  slowly, trying to find the words to describe how he was feeling.  "I woke up this morning with a sense of  foreboding, like something bad is gonna happen.  Nothing's happened yet, so it's probably nothing, but I still  can't shake that feeling.  It's making  me much more sensitive to what's going on around me, and I didn't want to get  distracted.  When whatever it is  happens, I need ta be ready to react."</p><p>"So that's why you didn't tease me  this morning, or insult your Pop, and why you paid more attention in class?"  she asked.</p><p>Ranma looked startled, and then  reached out and put his hand on hers.   "Akane, I enjoy teasing ya, that's all.   Remember the way Pop shows affection to me is ta insult me; I guess I  learned that lesson too well," he replied.</p><p>She blushed at the mention of  showing affection, 'I guess he does like me,' she thought.  The feel of his hand on hers was sending  shivers up and down her spine.  She  would have said more, but at that moment her friend Sakura ran up.  Ranma and Akane snatched their hands away  from each other.</p><p>"Ranma, I just heard.  Some girl was asking about you or your  dad.  She says her name is Shampoo,"  Sakura said, "She's right over there talking to those guys by the gate."</p><p>Ranma looked where Sakura was  pointing.  He saw a buxom girl, about  his age, with long lavender hair.  His  face paled, and then set in a grim line.   Sure enough it was Shampoo.   "Damn, I thought we lost her, I need to warn Pop," he said, "Akane, I  have to leave."</p><p>"Ranma, what's wrong?  Who's that girl?" she asked.</p><p>He shook his head.  "No time, 'kane.  I gotta go!  If you want,  come with me and I'll tell you once I've warned Pop," he said as he jumped  up.  He ran to the back wall of the  school, followed by Akane.  He picked  her up, and then jumped to the top of the wall and then down to the other  side.  He started running, still carrying  Akane cradled in his arms.  She held on  tight as he went on a direct line to Dr. Tofu's clinic, leaping up on roofs,  over whatever obstacle were in his way.   When he reached the clinic, he went in and found the panda sweeping the  floor.  He set Akane down, and then  said, "Pop, Shampoo's here."</p><p>"Thanks," said the sign.  The panda ran out the door and disappeared.</p><p>"Ranma, tell me what's going on?"  Akane asked worriedly, "She's not another fiancée, is she?"</p><p>Flashback</p><p>A cute, red-haired girl, a panda  wearing a yellowed gi and a bandanna, and the Jusenkyo guide were walking  toward a village.  The guide was  explaining in his broken Japanese that this was a tribe of Chinese Amazons, and  their elders knew a great deal about the curses.  Ranma was listening to him intently as he explained some of their  customs.  The panda was ignoring everything  except for the growling of his stomach.   The guide went on to say, "Honored customer, whatever you do, do not  challenge one of the women.  If an  outsider woman beats an Amazon in formal challenge, then Amazon tradition say  that Amazon must kill outsider to regain face."  Ranma looked worried after hearing that and resolved to keep her  cool and not respond to any challenges.   As they neared the village, he noticed a large feast laid out and two  women fighting.  "We in luck, Ancient  Amazon custom.  Village champion being  selected, very rare sight," the guide said.   Ranma watched the fight, cataloguing their every move, not paying  attention to anything else going on around her.  She was hungry, but she was fascinated by the various moves the  women were making.  She thought she  could pick up several of them pretty easily.   She decided to wait for everyone else to begin to eat.  One of the women, a girl about his own age,  with long lavender hair was clearly the better fighter.  She finally knocked the other woman out with  a hit from one of her bonborris.  The  village erupted in cheers.  At that  moment, the girl looked to where the feast was spread out, and shouted in  anger.  Ranma looked over and saw the  panda gorging itself on the food.</p><p>"Stupid Pop,' she thought angrily,  'I can't believe he is so stupid.'</p><p>"Very bad, honored customer eating  Victory Feast," the guide confirmed.</p><p>The girl ran toward the panda,  which got up and ran to hide behind Ranma.</p><p>"Pet very bad, eat Shampoo  feast.  Must fight to regain honor," the  girl said as she neared Ranma.  Or at  least that's what she thought she heard.</p><p>Ranma said, "Wait a minute, he's  not my pet, he's my father.  He just has  a curse.  I didn't eat your food, I was  too busy watching you two fight.  .Nice  job by the way."</p><p>"What mean curse," Shampoo asked,  breathing heavily.  Ranma had a hard  time responding since she was too busy watching what the heavy breathing was  doing.</p><p>Finally she said, "He fell in a  spring at Jusenkyo.  You're supposed to  know all about that.  Do you have any  hot water, I'll show you?" she said.   Then she noticed an extremely old woman pogo-sticking her way to them on  a long cane.  As she neared them, Ranma  bowed, "My name is Ranma Saotome.  This  is my father Gemna.  As you see we fell  afoul of Jusenkyo.  I would like to  apologize for his behavior, I'm sure he meant no disrespect."  'I think I handled that pretty well,' she  thought.</p><p>"My name is Cologne," the old woman  said, "You have dishonored my great granddaughter Shampoo by eating her victory  feast.  You must allow her to regain her  honor."</p><p>"Honored elder, as I was telling  Shampoo, this is my father Gemna.  If we  could get some hot water and change him back, I'm sure he would apologize  himself," Ranma began.  An Amazon male,  acting very subserviently, ran up with some hot water and poured it over the  panda transforming him into a middle-aged man.   Ranma said, "We had come here to ask about Jusenkyo curses; the guide  told us that you were considered an expert."</p><p>"Shampoo no interested in  curse.  Shampoo must restore honor.  You fight me!" she said.</p><p>Ranma sighed.  "If you need to fight someone to restore  your honor, fight the old man.  I was  too busy watching you fight.  He is the  one who dishonored you.  I have no  responsibility for his actions," Ranma said.</p><p>'Xian Pu, the young girl is  correct.  If you must fight someone, you  must fight her father.  He is at fault  here, not her.  Her actions have been  honorable,' Khu Lon said to her great granddaughter in Chinese.</p><p>'But, Khu Lon, I mean great  grandmother, he's so old,' Xian Pu whined.   Khu Lon just stared at her.</p><p>Shampoo pouted, and then said, "Old  man, you dishonor me, fight now."</p><p>"Sounds like a challenge, old  man.  You gonna back out or show what a  martial artist you are?" Ranma said with a smirk.  'This girl should make him pay for what he did to me,' Ranma  thought.</p><p>Her father growled at her, "Boy,  you go too far!"  With that, Shampoo  grabbed Gemna and dragged him over to the sparring area.</p><p>"Boy, I don't see any boy here!"  Ranma said with a laugh, "You're on your own."   'Man look at how downtrodden the men are here.  I better stay girl while we're here,' he thought.</p><p>Gemna and Shampoo began  fighting.  Gemna dodged several blows  from her bonborris, and then finally grabbed one of them out of her hand.  Shampoo backed away in shock.  No mere man could do that to an Amazon  woman.  She made another swing with her  remaining weapon.  Gemna countered with  the one that he had captured, and hit her handle with his handle.  Both handles broke off, sending the heads toward  each other.  Gemna managed to duck the  one flying towards him, but Shampoo wasn't so lucky.  She got hit on the head and knocked out.  'Damn, I guess she was too tired from the  other fight,' Ranma thought, 'I thought she would last longer than that.'</p><p>Shampoo woke up.  She looked downcast, then glared at  Gemna.  She walked over to him, kissed  him on the mouth and then said in disgust, "Wo ni, Airen."</p><p>Ranma turned to Cologne, and asked,  "That's not the Kiss of Death, was it?"</p><p>Cologne laughed, and replied, "No,  three thousand year old Amazon tradition is if a male beats an Amazon woman in  combat, then she is his wife.  That was  the Kiss of Marriage.  Shampoo doesn't  look too happy about it though.  Good,  maybe it will finally teach her humility."</p><p>"Hey, Pop, couldn't you get a wife  closer to your own age," Ranma called.   His father paled, ran over to Ranma and tried to run off.  Several Amazons stopped him however.</p><p>Cologne came over, "I don't think  you will be going anywhere.  Ranma, you  will be my new student.  You can move in  with Shampoo, your father and I."   Ranma's ears perked up at the thought of learning some new techniques.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"So anyway, we ended up staying  there about a month.  It wouldn't have  been too bad if I hadn't had to be constantly on my guard about  challenges.  I wasn't sure they would  have considered me an Amazon or not.   Pop kept saying that we needed to escape.  Finally, I was able to sneak us out while the bulk of the tribe  was off raiding another village; somebody called the Musk people.  Shampoo chased us for a while, but we lost  her.  I guess she's been hunting for Pop  ever since.  After all the dumb things  that he did to me, I kinda think it's funny that he got himself into this  mess," Ranma said, "I guess we might as well head on home and let Mom know."</p><p>Ranma and Akane ran home.  As they entered the living room, they  stopped in surprise.  Shampoo was there,  talking to Kasumi in Chinese!</p><p>"Ranma, Akane, this is  Shampoo.  Well, not exactly Shampoo, but  that is the closest we can say it in Japanese.   She came all the way from China to see your father.  I don't understand her dialect completely,  but she seems to be saying something about Amazon law and being the wife of  your father," Kasumi said, with a puzzled look on her face.</p><p>Shampoo interrupted, "Ranma no girl  now, Jusenkyo curse, too?"  Ranma  nodded.  "You know about Kiss of Death,  that why you no fight Shampoo?" she asked.</p><p>"No, I didn't fight you because  your complaint was with him.  I was  tired of cleaning up after Pop's messes.   Besides, I saw you fight remember, I thought you would take him.  I was too tired to beat him properly, and it  was time for his daily beating.  Are you  sure you want to be his wife?  You do  know that he is married already?" Ranma asked, "Is there a way to get you out  of the mess you're in?"</p><p>"Shampoo no know.  Great Grandmother no tell Shampoo all laws  yet.  Shampoo no have choice unless  Great Grandmother tell Shampoo otherwise.   Shampoo send message to village, and ask," she said.</p><p>Kasumi said, "I asked her to stay  here.  She doesn't know anyone here and  she looked so lost when she walked in the gate."  Shampoo looked grateful.</p><p>"We need Nabiki.  She needs to do some research and see if  there is any way out of this," Akane said, "Shampoo, why don't you send a  message to your village?  After that,  you look exhausted.  Would you like to  go relax in the furo, and then change into some clean clothes?"</p><p>Shampoo nodded.  "Send message to Embassy, they get message  to village.  Been long time Shampoo can  relax.  Village no like this Japan.  Too many rude people.  You nice people," she said.  They arranged a message to be sent to the  Chinese Embassy.  The lady there said it  would take several days for a reply to be received.  After that Shampoo and Akane went into the bathroom.  Kasumi went upstairs, and then came down  with a change of clothing for both of them and put them in the changing  room.  Then she asked Ranma to call Dr.  Tofu to come check on Shampoo.</p><p>Nabiki came home from school.  When she walked into the living room, she  spotted Ranma, and said, "Well, I guess that rumor wasn't true, that you and  Akane had run off together."</p><p>Ranma smirked, and said, "Well,  actually we did.  I carried her away  from school today at lunch, we just ran here."   With that, Nabiki sniffed, turned and ran up the stairs to change.  Ranma followed her, and knocked on her  door.  ""Yo, Nabiki, I needed to talk to  you.  I need your help," he said.</p><p>"Come on in, Ranma," Nabiki said  with a sigh, "I heard about the girl at school today as well.  Another one of your fiancées, I suppose?"</p><p>"Not quite.  She's my step-mother," he smirked.  He laughed at the expression on Nabiki's  face.  "Na, she's a Chinese Amazon who  says she is married to Pop.  We ran away  from her village, and I guess she has been tracking us ever since.  Remember I told you we stayed in an Amazon  village for a month.  She's part of the  reason."  He then proceeded to tell  Nabiki the story that he had told Akane earlier.  "I need you to see if we can find a way for Shampoo to get out of  this.  I don't think she really wants to  be married to him."</p><p>"Sure, I'll get right on it.  It'll only cost you 5000 yen because I like  you," she said.</p><p>Ranma grimaced and said, "I'm sure  glad I'm getting the family discount," as he handed her the money.</p><p>"Why are you doing this, though?"  Nabiki asked.  Ranma looked at her, and  then smirked.  He held out his  hand.  Nabiki looked at his hand, and  then chuckled.  "You're learning  entirely too fast," Nabiki said, as she gave him back 1000 yen.</p><p>Ranma said, "I just don't think  Shampoo needs to be stuck with him, and I want to make sure there aren't  anymore Amazon laws that we need to worry about.  I don't want any of us to do something that might end up with one  of us engaged to her, or marked for death.   Thanks, Nab-chan."  Then he  left.  Nabiki shook her head, fired up  her computer and began her search.</p><p>Ranma met his mother as she came  through the gate.  He hugged her and  then said, "We need to talk."  He  repeated the story about Shampoo again.   At first, Nodoka was upset, muttering something about panda-skin rugs,  but then Ranma said, "I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to be married to him; I  think she is just following her traditions because she's scared and doesn't  know what else to do."</p><p>Nodoka simply said, "Well, let's go  meet my rival."  They walked in and  found Shampoo helping Kasumi in the kitchen.</p><p>"Shampoo, I'd like you to meet my  mother," Ranma said.</p><p>Shampoo turned and gazed at  Nodoka.  She saw a reasonably tall,  auburn haired woman, neatly tailored.   The only disconcerting things about her were her eyes, and the katana  she was carrying in its sheath.  Shampoo  sighed and then bowed, "Nihao, Ranma's mother.   Where honored husband?"  She took  her bonborris out and laid them at Nodoka's feet, then bowed to Nodoka.  Major face faults all around.</p><p>Nodoka bowed back, to the precise  angle that Shampoo had bowed.  She said,  "Don't leave your weapons in the middle of the floor, someone might get  hurt.  Come, we need to talk,  child.  Kasumi, can I steal your helper  away from you?"  Kasumi smiled and  nodded.  Shampoo picked up her weapons,  looking a bit happier, and followed Nodoka into the living room.  Nodoka said, in Mandarin Chinese, Xian  Pu, my husband is not the man I thought he was when I married him.  I have discovered that he is without much  honor, not particularly brave, a great deal dishonest and very  egotistical.  He nearly destroyed Ranma  in trying to train him.  Why would you  want to marry him?  Is it just trying to  fulfill your tribal law, or is there something else?  What do you want to happen?</p><p>Shampoo said, I know he has  faults.  I saw some of them while he was  in the village.  Aside from training in  martial arts, the only thing he thought about was food and drink.  No honorable man would have run away from  the village after defeating me in formal challenge.  He is much older than I am.   So no, I am not happy with the situation.  I wish it had been your son who had accepted my challenge.  I wouldn't mind being married to him.  But Amazon law says I must wed the man who  beat me or face banishment</p><p>You are allowed to practice,  though, it has to be a formal challenge before who wins matters, correct?  Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Yes, it must be a formal  challenge.  That was my mistake.  I was too arrogant to back down when Ranma  and Great Grandmother forced me to challenge Airen.  Khu Lon told me that more than once before I left.  She said this should teach me humility,  Shampoo replied.</p><p>Nodoka repeated the gist of what  they had said to everyone.  Ranma looked  a little worried when he heard the part about Shampoo wishing she had fought  him and lost.  Akane and Nabiki both got  mad, thinking 'Another woman chasing my Ranma, wait a minute, when did he  become my Ranma?'</p><p>Ranma said, "I asked Nabiki to  check into Amazon law, and we sent a question to the village about the  situation.  Shampoo, don't take this the  wrong way, but I'm glad I didn't fight ya.   I wouldn't want ya trying ta kill me, and I definitely don't want to be  married this young."</p><p>"Shampoo understand.  Shampoo no want to be married this young  either.  No choice now, stupid laws,"  Shampoo said, shocking herself with the last sentence.  She started sobbing.  Nodoka reached out and held her, allowing  her to cry herself out.  Then Shampoo  fell asleep.</p><p>"The poor child is exhausted.  She must have been running on nervous energy  since she left home," Nodoka said, "Ranma, help me take her upstairs and put  her to bed."  Ranma gulped.  He took Shampoo in his arms and carried her  upstairs to the guest room.  He laid her  on the futon and left.  Nodoka undressed  Shampoo, took her weapons and laid them beside her on the floor and then  covered her with a blanket.  She sat  there looking as Shampoo, feeling very sorry for her.</p>
