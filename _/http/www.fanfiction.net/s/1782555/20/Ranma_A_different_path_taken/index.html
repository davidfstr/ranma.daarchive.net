</div><p>Chapter 20 Ranma Makes a Decision</p><p>Nabiki walked over to Ukyo as she  was heading outside to eat lunch.  "Hey,  Ukyo, can I join you for lunch?" Nabiki asked, "I need to talk to you."</p><p>Ukyo hesitated and then asked, "How  much this time?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled thinly, and said,  "How can you ask that of your partner?   I don't have any information to sell.   I just wanted a chance to talk and see how things were going at the  restaurant, is all."  Ukyo shrugged and  followed Nabiki over to the shade of a large tree and sat down.  They started eating their bentos.</p><p>After a minute or two, Nabiki  asked, "It looks like you're making a pretty good profit from the restaurant,  based on the receipts that I've seen.  I  was wondering if you were ready to expand, maybe start some sort of delivery  service," Nabiki asked, making what passed for small talk for her.</p><p>"Yes, the three of us stay pretty  busy every afternoon and evening.  What  would it take for a delivery service?   We've been asked several times if we had one.  We'd have to hire someone else though, Ryoga sugar couldn't do  it.  We could use Shampoo, but then we  would need someone else anyway to help with the cooking and waitressing," Ukyo  replied.</p><p>"I'm not sure what it would  take.  Since it sounds like you're  interested, I'll check around.  I've got  some contacts, after all.  We can find  someone else to work for you once we know what it'll take," Nabiki said. 'Damn,  it's getting close to the end of lunch.   This took too long to set up.   Hope she doesn't figure it out.'   She gazed around the schoolyard looking for Ranma and Akane.  "Hey, Ukyo, isn't that Ranma and Akane  sitting over there?" she asked innocently.</p><p>Ukyo looked at where she was  pointing.  "Yes, that's Ranma honey and  Akane.  They seem to be getting awfully  close lately, since they started rehearsing the play. .  I haven't seen him in a while," Ukyo said,  "It even looks like they are sitting shoulder to shoulder."</p><p>"Is that his arm around her waist?"  Nabiki said.  'Damn, that's clumsy.'</p><p>"I can't tell.  He might be," Ukyo said, "I think I need to  talk to my Ranchan and see what's going on."   She stood up, but at that moment the bell signaling the end of lunch  rang. Ranma and Akane jumped up and raced into the building.  Nabiki and Ukyo looked at each other and  then left to go their separate ways.  If  one of them had turned to look, she might have seen Shampoo step out from  behind the tree where she had been listening.   She had a thoughtful look on her face.   She wasn't exactly sure what she had heard, but it sounded exactly like  some of the girls in her village when they schemed to get rid of a rival.  'I need to talk to Ranma,' she thought.</p><p>The next morning Ranma and Akane  were walking to school.  For a change,  Ranma was walking side by side with Akane, instead of up on the fence.  "Yo, Acchan, Shampoo told me something last  night.  I need ya ta promise to listen  and not get angry, 'k?" he asked.</p><p>Puzzled, Akane said, "Okay,  Ranchan, I promise.  I'll listen."</p><p>"Shampoo overheard Nabiki talking  to Ukyo, yesterday at lunch.  It sounded  like she was kinda trying ta make Ukyo jealous.  After all, I haven't exactly had any time to talk with her  lately, what with all of the rehearsing we've been doing.  Not that I'm complaining, mind ya," he added  hastily, "I've enjoyed the time we've spent together on this.  She's probably gonna want ta try to come  between us and make ya mad at me.  If ya  can just not get angry, we'll defeat that plan, okay?"</p><p>"Two can play at that game,  Ranma.  Tell you what, why don't we  rehearse Act III, scene 5, the love scene, at lunch," Akane said with an evil  grin.</p><p>Ranma chuckled.  "That's the spirit, Acchan," he said.</p><p>At lunch, Ranma and Akane found a  shady spot in the schoolyard and began eating their bentos.  Ranma leaned against the tree and set his  books next to him.  Akane sat as close to  him as she could.  Ranma had finished  his, when Ukyo walked over.</p><p>"Ranma honey, do you want an  okonomiyaki?" Ukyo asked.  She tried to  sit down between Ranma and Akane, but they were too close together.  She couldn't sit down next to Ranma because  of the tree he was leaning against.</p><p>"Huh, no, Ucchan, I'm fine.  Kasumi packed a big lunch today.  I'm glad you're here though; we need someone  to help read through this scene.  We  need someone ta play the part of the nurse.   Do ya mind?" Ranma said, "This is kinda one of the big love scenes, and  I'm not sure we've got it down right."</p><p>"Sure sugar, anything for you,"  Ukyo replied.</p><p>"Thanks, Ukyo.  Here, this is the scene we want to  practice," Akane said, as she handed her a copy of the script, "Scoot closer,  Ranma, I'll have to share yours," she continued.</p><p>Akane began reciting her lines,  "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day: it was the nightingale, and not the  lark, that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; nightly she sings on yon  pomegranate-tree:  Believe me, love, it  was the nightingale."</p><p>Ranma responded, "It was the lark,  the herald of the morn, no nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks do  lace the severing clouds in yonder east:   Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty  mountain tops.  I must be gone and live,  or stay and die."  'I still sound like  Kuno,' he thought.</p><p>"Yon light is not day-light, I know  it, I:  It is some meteor that the sun  exhales, to be to thee this night a torch-bearer, and light thee on thy way to Mantua:  Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be  gone," Akane replied.</p><p>"Let me be ta'en, let me be put to  death; I am content, so thou wilt have it so.   I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, tis but the pale reflex of  Cynthia's brow; nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven  so high above our heads:  I have more  care to stay than will to go:  Come,  death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.   How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day," he recited.</p><p>Akane said, "It is, it is: hie  hence, be gone, away!  It is the lark  that sings so out of tune, straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.  Some say the lark makes sweet division; this  doth not so, for she divideth us.  Some  say the lark and loathed toad change eyes, O, now I would they had changed  voices too!  Since arm from arm that  voice doth us affray, hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day, O, now be  gone; more light and light it grows."</p><p>Ranma replied, "More light and  light; more dark and dark our woes!"</p><p>Ukyo said, unsurely, "Madam!"</p><p>Akane replied, "Nurse?"</p><p>Ukyo read, "Your lady mother is  coming to your chamber:  The day is  broke; be wary, look about."  'I don't  like this,' she thought.</p><p>"Then, window, let day in, and let  life out," Akane said.</p><p>"Farewell, farewell!  One kiss, and I'll descend," Ranma  replied.  He leaned over and kissed  Akane weakly on the cheek. 'Sorry, Ukyo, you don't deserve this, but you  shouldn't have let Nabiki use you,' he thought sadly.</p><p>"Okay, stop Ranma," Akane said,  "Remember, in this scene, we're married and we just spent the night making  love.  Do you really think that's the  kind of kiss two lovers who are being separated would have?  What do you think Ukyo?  Don't you think it would be more like  this?"  She leaned over and kissed Ranma  hungrily, her arms pulling him tight to her body.</p><p>"Uh, the kiss you did was better,  Akane," Ukyo said, jumping up, "Listen, guys, I gotta run.  I just forgot I was supposed to meet  someone."  She hurried off, angrily.</p><p>"That was mean, Akane," Ranma said,  once he got his breath back, "But I think it worked temporarily.  I hope this will get Nabiki to back  off.  I'm just sorry we hurt Ukyo like  that.  You know I'm gonna have ta go  apologize to her this afternoon."</p><p>Akane looked at her, and then  looked down at the ground, and said, "You're right, Ranma.  I was a bit cruel.  There's a little time before we have rehearsal after school.  Tell her I'm sorry, too."</p><p>After school, Ranma caught up to  Ukyo before she left the schoolyard.   "Ukyo, can we talk for a second.   I'm sorry about what happened at lunch.   Akane kinda got carried away.  We  didn't mean ta hurt ya like that," he said.</p><p>Ukyo glared at him, and said, "You  should be sorry, I didn't need to see her coming on to you like that."</p><p>"Ucchan, you're my friend, but  that's all you are.  I've never  encouraged you ta think differently, either.   After that date we had, I just don't see ya as a girlfriend.  I don't know what it was, but I never felt  comfortable that evening," Ranma said.</p><p>"What's wrong with me, Ranma?  What do I have to change?  Have you fallen for someone else?" Ukyo said  sadly.</p><p>"I don't think there's anything  wrong with ya.  It's me.  I just don't see ya that way, is all," Ranma  said, "As for there being someone else, I'm not sure.  I'm kinda confused right now.   Sorry, I gotta run or I'll be late for rehearsal.  See ya."   He ran off toward the auditorium.</p><p>Ukyo stared after him and said,  "I'm not done with you yet, Ranma.   You'll be mine."</p><p>The evening of the final  performance, the curtain had just come down on the final scene of the play,  with the audience applauding wildly.   The curtain opened, and the actors came out for their curtain calls,  with the loudest applause reserved for Akane and Ranma as they came out  together as the last of the cast.  They  bowed, and then Ranma ran offstage where he encountered Shampoo.  There he saw Kuno tied up.  Shampoo winked at Ranma and handed him a  large bouquet of roses.  Shampoo said,  "Kuno tried to steal these roses, just like you thought, Ranma."  Ranma bowed in thanks, then ran back and  presented the roses to Akane.  Akane  blushed prettily, and then blushed even more as Ranma held her in his arms and  kissed her.  Then they turned and faced  the audience again, and bowed, acknowledging the applause.  The curtains closed again, and then reopened  for one more bow.  Finally, the curtains  closed for the final time and they could go offstage.  They quickly removed their makeup and costumes and got  dressed.  Ranma and Akane met each other  outside of the dressing rooms, Akane happily carrying her bouquet.  She grabbed Ranma's hand and they walked  outside to meet their family.  As they  neared them, Ranma saw a slight frown on Nabiki's face, especially when she  realized they were holding hands.</p><p>Nodoka beamed with pride at Ranma.  She said, "You two did wonderfully, that was  an excellent portrayal of the two young lovers.  It almost looked like it was for real."</p><p>Kasumi hugged both of them, and  then said, "I bet you two are really tired.   Let's get you home and into bed, the both of you."</p><p>"Yes, Mommy," Ranma said, with a  laugh.  Kasumi swatted him playfully as  they headed home.  "Actually, I am a bit  tired.  The cast party last night  dragged on entirely too long," he said, "I just want to crawl into my futon and  go to sleep."</p><p>They reached the house and Akane  put her bouquet in a vase of water and carried it upstairs to her room.  Ranma followed her to her room, and hugged  her.  "Akane, I'm glad you talked me  into this.  I actually enjoyed it, even  though I kept sounding like Kuno spouting that dialogue," he said, with a  laugh.</p><p>"Thanks again for the roses,  Ranma.  I was afraid you wouldn't have  known you were supposed to do that," Akane said.</p><p>"No problem, Akane.  I glad you like them.  Night, 'kane," he said as he walked to his  room.  'It looks like we escaped all of  Nabiki's traps.  I can't believe she was  trying to make us dislike each other.   If I hadn't had Shampoo guard those flowers, Akane would have hated me  for missing the tradition of the leading actor giving the leading actress a big  bouquet of flowers.  I'm just glad Mom  knew about that tradition, or I would have been a dead man tonight.  It would have been a major insult if I  hadn't given her the flowers.  What's  with Nabiki anyway?' he thought.</p><p>The next evening, Ranma was in his  favorite spot to think.  After dinner,  he had hopped onto the roof of the Tendo home, and lay there staring into the  starry sky, pondering the decision he was about to make.  He had actually enjoyed performing in the  play; while his first love was and always would be martial arts, he had come to  realize that he wanted a broader lifestyle than that.  His Pop had given him a hard time about the play, saying that it  would make him soft, and that a true martial artist wouldn't have wasted his  time that way.  His mother however had  supported his decision, though he couldn't help wonder if she didn't have an  ulterior motive.  Performing in the play  with Akane had acted as a catalyst for his thinking.  Somehow, because of all the time they had spent together, between  studying for class, studying their lines, or later, rehearsing for the play, he  realized his feelings for Akane had changed.   With her only real rival for his heart taken by Tofu, he had fallen hard  for Akane.  Sure she was cute,  especially when she smiled, she was turning into a very good martial artist.  But she had a temper, she couldn't cook to save her life and insulted him  occasionally now and then, though she had gotten better about that.</p><p>He chuckled at himself.  'I know that it's a show business cliché  about stage romances,' he thought, 'but the reason it's a cliché is that it  happens so often.  When did I finally  really stop thinking about her as a friend and begin to see her as something  more?  I know we will still have our  misunderstandings, and get angry at each other, but we are getting better at  listening to each other and actually hearing what is said.  Like I don't have a temper, and I don't  occasionally say the wrong thing.   Right, who am I kidding.  Face  it, when she does something nice for me, or smiles with those gorgeous eyes; my  heart just melts.  You know you like  her, really, really care for her.  If  those dreams you've been having lately mean anything, you really don't think of  her as just a sister.  Why can't you  tell her what you feel, baka?  Maybe she  feels the same way.'  He sighed, jumped  down from the roof and reentered the house.   Reluctantly, he walked upstairs and knocked on Akane's door.  She opened the door and looked at him in  some surprise.</p><p>"Ranma, what's wrong?  You look like you've been fighting a demon  or something!" she asked when she saw how wrung out he looked.</p><p>"I been doing something much  harder, I'm been thinking," he smiled a bit wryly, "Can we talk?  I need ta ask ya something."  She nodded and let him enter her room.  He shut the door behind him.  He knelt down on the floor and bowed to her.</p><p>"Akane, ya know that I like you and  your sisters, doncha?" he asked.  She  nodded, not sure where this was going.   "Well, what I was wrestling with this evening was about that.  I started thinking about you, and I realized  that I'm not satisfied with just being your friend anymore.  I wanna be your boyfriend, I think I  l-l-love ya" he said hopefully.</p><p>Akane gasped, and then  blushed.  "Ranma, I really like you,  too.  I never expected you to fall for  me; I thought you'd end up with Nabiki, instead.  She's smarter than me, sexier than me and doesn't fight with  you," she said.  She looked down for a  second and then said, "I do want to be your girlfriend.  I love you."  He looked at her, eyes wide, not believing what he had  heard.  She bent down and kissed  him.  They had had a lot of practice  kissing for the play, but this time it felt different.  Her eyes went wide as Ranma returned her  kiss passionately.  They broke apart,  blushing furiously.  "Where do we go  from here, Ranma?" she asked shyly.</p><p>"We need to talk to your sisters,  and let them know how we feel about each other.  I'll be surprised if they haven't already figured it out already  though.  Now don't take this the wrong  way, but I just wanna be your boyfriend, ya know.  I'm not ready for anything more," he confessed.</p><p>"I'm not ready to be a fiancée yet  either," she said, "I'm still too young for that.  We'll have to be careful around our fathers.  They will start putting pressure on us to  become engaged, or even marry, if they figure out that we love each other."</p><p>"I know, but the idea doesn't scare  me as much as it used ta, you know.   When Pop and I first came here, the thought of being engaged was pretty  scary.  Because of you, it's not  anymore," Ranma said.  Then he heard  something at the door.  He mouthed 'Keep  talking,' as he went to the door.  Akane  started saying something, but Ranma wasn't paying any attention.  He grabbed the doorknob and jerked the door  open.  Nabiki fell into the room,  dropping the glass she had had next to her ear.  Ranma caught her before she hit the floor.  He looked down the hall.  No one else was there.  "We needed ta talk ta ya anyway.  Glad you could drop in," Ranma said with a  laugh.  He set Nabiki back on her feet  and then noticed that Akane was looking upset.   Once he let go of Nabiki, however, she seemed to cool off.  'Uh, oh, a little jealousy there,' he  thought.  "We need to get Kasumi, as  well," he said as he ran downstairs.   There he found Kasumi finishing up in the kitchen.  "Kasumi-chan, we're having a meeting in  Akane's room.  Could you join us  please," he asked politely.  Kasumi  smiled gently, hoping this meant what she thought it meant, and nodded.  They went upstairs and joined the two  girls.  Ranma left the door open this  time so he could hear if anyone came upstairs.</p><p>"We should have a bit of privacy,"  Kasumi said, "Our fathers went out in search of some sake.  Nodoka and Shampoo went with them to try to  keep them sober."</p><p>"That's good," Ranma said,  "Remember when we first started this plan, we uh."  Akane walked over and held his hand firmly, interrupting him.</p><p>"What Ranma is trying to say, is  that we decided to try being a couple.   Just being boyfriend and girlfriend for now; not anything more.  Neither of us is ready for anything else."</p><p>Nabiki froze for a second, even  though she had already heard most of what they had said through the door.  'Damn, I knew I should have done something  about Akane.  I thought they were  getting too close,' she thought.  "I'm  happy for the two of you," she said, hoping that they wouldn't hear the pain in  her voice.</p><p>Kasumi smiled.  "I've known for a while how you two really  thought about each other.  I could tell  from the way you were acting during your rehearsals at the house that something  was going on.  I just wondered how long  it would take for you to admit it to yourselves," she said.  Even though she was in love with Tofu, she  felt again the little twinge of regret for what might have been.  She remembered the surprise she had felt at  being hurt at how quickly he had seemed to turn completely to her sister. 'I  didn't think I was that petty,' she thought.   She walked over to Ranma and hugged him, and said, "Thanks, little  brother, you've made me very happy."</p><p>Ranma face-faulted, 'Little  Brother,' he thought, and then he hugged her back.  "Little brother, that has a nice sound to it, Kasumi-chan," he  said, "I kinda like having a couple of big sisters, doncha know.  My only worry now is what our fathers will  do when they find out.  I don't want to  pretend that we aren't a couple, but I don't want ta get forced into an  engagement at my age, either."</p><p>"Maybe we ought to bring your  mother in on this.  She takes contracts  pretty seriously after all, and our fathers do have a contract.  We need to tell her why you want to wait  until you're of age to marry as well.   We need to tell her of our suspicions about your father.  She would help keep him under control.  I can keep our father from doing anything  drastic if he isn't encouraged by yours," Nabiki said.</p><p>As Shampoo and the parents came  through the gate to the Tendo residence, Kasumi intercepted Nodoka.  "Auntie Nodoka, I need to talk to you," she  said as she pulled Nodoka away.  Soun  and Gemna were too out of it to notice, they kept walking toward the  house.  Shampoo was curious and followed  Kasumi and Nodoka.  Kasumi led them to  the dojo, where they met Ranma, Akane and Nabiki.  Nodoka's eyes widened slightly as she realized how close Ranma  and Akane were standing, and then gasped when she saw that they were actually  holding hands.</p><p>"Did you two finally decide to  admit your feelings to yourselves?" she asked with a smile.</p><p>"Great, were we the only two people  who didn't know what was going on?" Ranma said with exasperation.  Kasumi and Shampoo giggled at the disgust in  his voice.</p><p>"No, I'm sure Gemna and Soun are  both pretty clueless," Nodoka said.</p><p>"Kuno doesn't know anything either,  but then I'm not sure what world he lives in anyway," Nabiki said.</p><p>"Why do we need to talk?" Shampoo  asked, "I'm just glad stepson made a good choice."</p><p>"You're right.  Akane and I finally realized how we felt  about each other, but we want to just try being boyfriend and girlfriend.  We both think we are too young for anything else,  right now.  So an engagement, much less  a marriage, we just don't wanna think about.   We are all just afraid that if we start showing too much affection for  each other, we'll be married before we can say no," Ranma said.</p><p>"For several reasons, we think that  they need to wait for anything that serious until they are a bit older.  Ranma wants to wait until he is of age  before he gets married, because we are afraid that if he does sooner than that,  your husband would be named guardian for the property.  To be honest, we just don't trust him,"  Nabiki said, "They are also concerned about the rumor and talk that will happen  at school if they were to become engaged."</p><p>"You're right not to trust  Gemna.  I took a look at that report  that you prepared about him, Nabiki.  It  was pretty complete, but I had someone else do some digging and found a few  more things out about him that I'm not happy about.  I think he would try to steal the property out from under you if  we let him," Nodoka said, "However, if you two do decide to get serious, there  are some things that I can do to prevent it from happening.  Don't worry about him if you do decide to  get married sooner.  Besides, I don't  want to wait too long for my grandchildren."</p><p>"MOM!" Ranma said with a blush.</p><p>"Auntie Nodoka!" Akane echoed.</p><p>"Seriously, it may be time for me  to make a few decisions of my own," Nodoka said, "I have been reluctant to do  so, but what you have told me tonight changes things."  Xian Pu, we need to talk, daughter  Nodoka said, firmly.  Ranma took the  hint and led everyone else out of the dojo.   Nabiki looked wistfully behind, but since she didn't understand Chinese,  it wouldn't have mattered.  She made a  mental note again to learn to speak the language.</p><p>Ranma led Akane around to the side of the house, and  then picked her up and hopped onto the roof where he put her down.  "Remind me to teach ya how ta do that.  You should be ready," he said, "Please sit  down, there's something else I need ta talk ta ya about."  They sat down, and Ranma held both of Akane's  hands in his.  He hesitated, not sure  exactly how to say the words that he needed to say.  "Akane, I want ya again ta promise ta listen ta me before ya say  anything, okay?"</p><p>Akane looked concerned, and said,  "Okay, I'll try."</p><p>"Akane, I love you with my whole  heart, ya need ta know that.  However,  one of the reasons it took me so long ta tell ya how I felt, is that there was  somebody else confusing me," Ranma said.</p><p>"Were you in love with someone  else?" Akane asked, trying not to get angry.</p><p>"Maybe, I'm not sure," Ranma said,  "Kasumi and I felt something for each other, but I kept having the same  feelings for you.  You needed ta know  how I felt about her.  I can't have any  secrets from ya that someone might use against us.  When Tofu asked her to marry her, it forced me to realize what I  felt for you and then to realize that those feelings had strengthened.  That's when I began ta figure out that you  were the one I wanted, but I had ta make sure.   I owed it ta you."</p><p>Akane sat there quietly, and then  asked, "Are you sure you love me, Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma said, "Yes, I'm sure, dear  Akane.  I wasn't just acting when we  were on stage.  While those weren't the  words I would have chosen, especially since they made me sound too much like  Kuno, the emotions were real.  Tonight I  finally let myself realize it."  He  reached for her, and hesitantly kissed her.   She pulled him into a tight embrace and kissed back hungrily.  Eventually, they separated.  As he looked into her eyes in wonder, he  remembered one more thing.  "Akane, what  do you want to do about the kids at school?   I don't want to hide our relationship from them, but they are sure to  ask lots of embarrassing questions."</p><p>Akane replied, "I don't want to  hide, either, besides Nabiki will sell the story anyway.  We might as well be open about our feelings,  and if any of the kids get too embarrassing, I'll make them regret it."</p><p>"That's my beautiful tomboy," he  said with a laugh.</p><p>"Ranma, this has been a very  surprising evening.  It's getting late  though and we have school tomorrow.  Can  we go inside now?" she asked.  Ranma  picked her up and lightly jumped to the ground.  He carried her toward the house.   "Hey, I can walk, you know?" she protested mildy.</p><p>"I know, I just like having ya in  my arms," he replied.</p><p>Author's Notes:  Again thanks for all of the reviews and  constructive criticism.  I do pay  attention to every one of them.  I hope  you have enjoyed what you have read so far.</p><p>Now for those who are curious, when  I first came up with the basic idea for this story I did intend for it to be  Ranma and Akane as the pairing.   However, up until the previous chapter, it had changed to a distinct  possibility of him ending up with Kasumi.   Then I rewrote the Romeo and Juliet story, and that really wasn't  possible anymore.  For those not  familiar with acting in a play, the cast does get extremely close.  After all, you spend several weeks, if not  months, in close proximity, especially if you are the major stars.  I just couldn't see how Ranma and Akane  wouldn't develop this kind of relationship.   At the end of the play, they would either love each other, or not be  able to stand the sight of each other.   I chose the former.</p>
