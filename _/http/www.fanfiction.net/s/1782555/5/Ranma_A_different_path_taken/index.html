</div><p>Chapter 5 To Date Akane</p><p>Then came Saturday.  Akane spent several hours Saturday looking  for the right outfit to wear.  She just  about drove Kasumi crazy trying to find just the right thing.  This was her first real date and she wanted  it to go right, even if it was just Ranma.   Finally she settled on something, and came downstairs where Ranma was  waiting for her.  He was wearing one of  his nicer outfits, one she had helped him pick out at the store the day before.</p><p>Ranma gazed at her as she came  downstairs.  His eyes widened as he saw  how pretty she looked.  Nabiki saw his  reaction, and said to him in a low voice, "Like what you see, huh?"  He just blushed, and then nodded his head,  not quite trusting his voice.  Nabiki  elbowed him, and hissed, "Say something nice, you jerk!"</p><p>"Akane, that dress looks good on  you, you look very nice," Ranma finally managed to say.  Akane blushed, thinking 'He actually  complimented me!  Maybe this won't be  too bad after all.'</p><p>Akane and Ranma left the house and  headed toward the restaurant that she had selected.  They walked along without speaking for a while, Ranma deep in  thought.  Finally, Ranma gulped, and  said again, "You sure look beautiful tonight, Akane."</p><p>Akane blushed, and then replied, "Thank  you Ranma, you look nice tonight too.   I'm flattered you're wearing the outfit I helped you with."  'Another compliment, is he starting to like  me,' she wondered.  Ranma just  smiled.  They entered the restaurant and  got seated at the table.</p><p>After ordering shrimp tempura for  the both of them, Ranma started telling her about some of what he had seen and  done during his ten years of traveling with his father.  She listened in fascination as he described  some of the training he had endured.   Then she asked, "Ranma, how did you turn out the way you did?  I know you figured out that your father  wasn't the best role model, but how?"</p><p>"Ya know, we left a bunch of the  schools in a hurry, often in the middle of the night.  Well, once I was old enough to notice that, I realized he wasn't  the most honest person in the world.  I  started trying to pay attention to what else wasn't making sense between what  he said, and what I was seeing.  I  remember a couple of schools in particular.   The first one had two senseis, one a man and the other his wife.  They shared equal responsibility for  training.  They also shared the  decision-making.  That kinda proved that  Pop was wrong about women being weaker.   It also showed me that there was more to being a martial artist than  just learning techniques.  That part of  being a martial artist was taking responsibility for my actions.  The other school I remember was one we  didn't stay long at.  It was run by an  assistant master of Kamiya Kas – something, I forget the rest.  She was a woman with a strong sense of honor  and responsibility as well.  And I told  ya about the Amazon women, before.  One  of the things I did because of those experiences was to start a journal where I  wrote down the scams, and outright thefts that I found out about, with the  eventual idea of trying to make amends," he said, "I guess that's why I turned  out the way I did.  I was able to find  some better role models to pattern myself after."  Then he began to describe some more of his adventures.  She listened to what he was saying and lost  herself in his eyes.</p><p>She could tell however that there  were some things he was still hiding from her.   After a while, she opened up and began to describe some of her life to  him.  He heard a tale of a close knit  family, devastated by the death of their mother, the dissolution of the strong  man who had been her father, the slow changing of her sisters from the  playmates of her childhood to the people they were today, heard the sorrow in  her voice as she described how much she missed the way her life used to  be.  He wished there was some way that  he could remove the pain that he heard.</p><p>"Akane, I wish I had met your  mother before she died.  She sounds like  a wonderful person.  The fact that the  three of you have managed to turn out so well shows me how well she must have  raised you.  All three of you are so  different, but there is still the same inner strength that I can sometimes  see.  You must have gotten your inner  fire from her.  It's what makes you the  person that you are.  And then, all  three of you have the same smile, one that really lights up your face," he  said.</p><p>"Thanks Ranma, I loved my mother a  great deal.  I wish she had met you too,  I know she would have liked you.  And  your right, knowing her even as short a time as it was, I can see some of her  in both my sisters," she said softly.</p><p>"Akane, I envy you.  I wish I'd known my mother; yours sounds so  wonderful.  The three of you must take  after her a lot," Ranma said finally, "she must have been lovely."</p><p>Akane sat there for a moment, and  then said, "Sounds like you feel like you missed a big portion of your life not  having your mother with you.  Was all  the traveling really worth it?"</p><p>"I used to think so, but that was  before I met you three.  Like I said, I  wish I had known my Mom, Pop doesn't talk about her, I think she may be dead,  "he replied.  He sat there looking  slightly sad.  Akane wished that there  was some way she could have cheered him up.</p><p>They began to hear some music in  the background.  They looked up and  noticed that there was a small dance floor tucked away in one corner of the  room and a music group had just started playing some dance music.  Several couples were already out on the  dance floor, slow dancing together.   Akane looked wistfully at the couples, eyes misting just a bit.</p><p>Ranma said, "Akane, I'm not very  good at dancing, but, I mean, if ya want, I'd like to try with you."</p><p>Akane's eyes widened.  She nodded, almost shyly, as Ranma helped  her out of the chair and they walked over to the dance floor.  Ranma put his arm around her waist, (a bit  nervously to be sure) and held her as they began to dance.  At first, they were a bit stiff together,  but once they got past the initial awkwardness, they began to move gracefully  around the floor.  Akane rested her head  against his chest and thought to herself, 'Why does he think he's no good at  this?  He's very graceful.'  When the music finally stopped, after  several slow dance tunes, she found herself reluctant to let him go.  He smiled gently, and led her back to the  table.</p><p>"Ranma, thank you.  You did a fine job.  Why do you think you're no good at dancing?"  she asked.</p><p>He gallantly answered, "I think it  had everything to do with my partner.   It's easy to dance with you."</p><p>'Is he flirting with me?' Akane  thought in shock.</p><p>He hesitated, and then asked, "You  'bout ready to go?"  She nodded.  He paid the restaurant bill and helped her  out of her chair.  They left the  restaurant.  As they walked down the  street heading toward the movie theater, Ranma got splashed with water, triggering  the change.  Ranma just turned to Akane,  shrugged her shoulders, and said, "Sorry about this, Akane, I was having fun  talking to ya, but I guess this ends the evening."</p><p>Akane thought to herself, 'It's  still Ranma.' "No, that's ok, Ranma, that outfit still looks okay on you.  We can still go to the movie," she  said.  "Though, maybe we ought to go see  a chick flick, now," she said with a giggle.</p><p>Ranma mock growled at her, "Very  funny, very funny.  Whatever you want to  see is okay so long as it doesn't get too mushy."  They reached the theater, found a movie they both agreed on, and  went in.  After the movie was over, they  left the theater and started home.  They  walked past an ice cream shop; Ranma grabbed Akane's hand and pulled her  inside.  They ordered a couple of ice  cream sundaes.  When they came, Ranma  said, "This is one advantage of being a girl.   Pop said boys can't eat this stuff, and I really like them."</p><p>Akane just giggled, and then said,  "You mean boys can't eat ice cream?"</p><p>"Naw, we can eat ice cream, he just  taught me that I can't eat sundaes and parfaits, things like that.  Those are for girls, anyways that's what he  says," Ranma said with a smile.</p><p>"Well, we know how accurate his  opinions on girls is, don't we?" she replied, rolling her eyes.  Both girls giggled, and then left the shop  and headed home.</p><p>Ranma walked beside her for a  moment, apparently deep in thought.   Then she stopped.  "Akane, have  we become friends?" she asked wistfully.</p><p>Akane hesitated, and then hugged  Ranma.  "Yes Ranma, we are friends, I  meant it when I asked you before, and nothing's changed that," she replied  forcefully.  Then she grabbed Ranma's  hand and held it the rest of the way home.</p><p>As they were about to enter the  gate to the house, Akane stopped him.   "Ranma, this has been a wonderful evening.  I glad you asked me out.   Promise me, we'll do this again sometime," she said.</p><p>Ranma gazed into her eyes, and  said, "I'm glad we did this too, 'kane.   It's so much easier to talk to you without all of the distractions.  Between school and everything, we don't  always get a chance to talk.  When you  asked if I wanted to be friends the first day we met, that meant a lot to  me.  I never want to lose that with  you."  Akane gazed at her for a long  time it seemed, and then sighed.</p><p>Akane led the way into the house,  where they met her sisters.  They  dragged her off upstairs.  Ranma sighed,  went into the bathroom and changed.   Then he headed outside to sit on the roof and think.  He stared into the peaceful night sky,  looking at all of the stars.</p><p>An hour or so later, Akane finally  managed to get rid of her sisters.  They  had wanted to find out everything about the date.  She still was blushing from some of the comments that Nabiki had  made.</p><p>"Yo, Akane," a low voice said.</p><p>Startled, she said, "Who's there?"</p><p>Ranma replied, "Just me,  Ranma.  I didn't mean ta scare ya.  I was just up here gazing at the sky.  I like it out here sometimes; it gives me a  chance ta think.  Ya want ta join me?"</p><p>"Sure, how do I get out there?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"Just climb out the window, I'll  pull ya up," he replied.</p><p>She did as he asked, and he pulled  her up to the roof.  He led her over to  a blanket that he had spread out on the tiles.   They sat down.  She stared at the  sky for a while, and then said, "You're right.   It's pretty and peaceful out here, I can see why you like it."</p><p>"Yeah, I always liked staring into  the night sky when we were on the trail.   It helped me think.  Akane, I'm  sorry I ended up changing into a girl on our date, there was something that I  wanted to do," he said.  He gazed at her  intently; she turned her head to look at him.   Her eyes got big when she realized what he had meant.  She leaned over and closed the distance  between them, brushing her lips with his.   They both blushed, and drew back.   "Thanks, 'kane.  I'm glad my  first kiss was with you.  You're my  closest friend, after all," he said.</p><p>Akane said, "Ranma, I'm glad my  first real kiss was with you, too.  I  know this was supposed to be a 'just friends' date, but I wanted to end my  first real date with a kiss, too.  I'm  still not ready to be anything more than just friends, though.  Is that okay?  Remember, I'm still supposed to hate boys."  She giggled.</p><p>"This was my first date, too, 'kane.  I wanted it to end the right way as  well.  I'm not looking for anything else  yet, either, so friends is fine with me," he said.  Then he yawned.  "Sorry, I  guess I getting pretty sleepy.  Ya ready  for me to take ya back inside?"  She  nodded, not trusting her voice.  He  grabbed the blanket, picked her up in his arms and lightly jumped down to the  ground.  He led her into the house.  They quietly went upstairs to their  respective rooms and went to sleep.</p>
