</div><p>Author's Note:  Reposted to fix a few grammatical mistakes.</p><p>Chapter 10 The Black Rose</p><p>Ranma was pretty disgusted.  She had almost made it the entire day again  without being splashed, and then as she was passing that old lady, she had  gotten wet.  She was almost home when  she overheard the sound of a fight.  She  turned the corner and discovered three girls in Furinkan High School uniforms  being attacked by a girl in a leotard.   Ranma rushed over and snatched the ribbons out of the girl's hands and  threw her to the ground.  "I don't know  who you are, but these girls are hurt pretty bad.  There's no excuse for what you are doing!" she cried.</p><p>"I am the Black Rose of St.  Hebereke High School, I answer to no common trash like you," the girl  cried.  She jumped up and disappeared,  leaving a trail of black roses behind her.</p><p>"Who was that?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"That was the captain of the St.  Hebereke Martial Arts Gymnastics team.   We're what's left of the Furinkan team.   We're supposed to have a match with them next weekend, and now we'll  have to forfeit unless we can find someone to take our place," one of the girls  said.</p><p>"We're almost to Dr. Tofu's  clinic.  Come with me there and he can  take a look at your injuries.  Maybe  they're not as bad as you think," Ranma replied.  She helped the three girls stagger over to Dr. Tofu's  clinic.  They met Akane entering the  clinic.  She was returning a book that  Kasumi had borrowed.</p><p>Akane asked, "What happened to you  three?"</p><p>The leader of the group explained  how the girl from St. Hebereke had attacked them, saying, "They have never lost  a match, but that's because the other team has to forfeit.  Looks like we'll have to do the same, since  there's no one left on our team."</p><p>"Let me do it," Akane volunteered.</p><p>All of the girls got excited and  happy.  Ranma looked startled.  Akane and Ranma left the three girls in the  capable hands of Dr. Tofu.  Ranma waited  until the girls went into the exam room and then borrowed some hot water.  After changing back, they headed home.  As they entered the dojo, Ranma asked, "Do  you know anything about Martial Arts Gymnastics?"</p><p>"No, but how hard can it be?" Akane  replied.</p><p>Akane started practicing with the  various pieces of equipment, the clubs, the ribbons and the hoops.  Nothing went where she wanted it to, and she  began to get frustrated.  Ranma tried to  help, but he wasn't any better.  "Akane,  unless we can find someone who knows about this stuff, I think you're in  trouble," Ranma said.</p><p>At that moment a voice was heard  behind them, "Maybe I can help, I picked up a few things about Martial Arts  Gymnastics in my travels."  They turned  and there in the doorway stood Ryoga.</p><p>Akane and Ranma looked at each  other and shrugged their shoulders.   Akane said, "Do you two promise not to fight until after the  match?"  Ryoga and Ranma agreed quickly.  Seeing that, Akane said, "Okay then, I could  use the pointers.  I'm not getting  anywhere doing what I am doing."  Ranma  got out of the way and watched Ryoga begin training Akane.  He was actually pretty impressed by Ryoga's  teaching ability.  After a couple of  hours, Akane was beginning to get the basics of the various tools down.  Finally, Kasumi came out to tell them it was  time for dinner, inviting Ryoga to join them.   After dinner, Ranma took Ryoga upstairs and showed him where he could  sleep.</p><p>Akane went into her room after  dinner.  She was about to sit down on  her bed, when she noticed a black rose in the middle of the bed.  Then she looked and there hiding above her  in one corner of the room, was a black haired girl, wearing a leotard.  She lashed out at Akane with a ribbon.  It missed, but Akane screamed.  Ranma came running in the door, and ran into  the girl knocking her off balance.  The  girl climbed out the window, Akane following her.  Ranma jumped out after them and saw the two girls fighting on the  roof.  Finally Akane got a solid blow in  and knocked the girl off the roof.   Ranma ran over and caught the girl before she could land on her  head.  The girl turned, and said, "My  hero, you saved me.  What's your name?"</p><p>He realized that this was the same  girl from the afternoon.  He answered,  "I'm Ranma Saotome."  She sighed and  kissed him.  "I am Kodachi, the Black  Rose of St. Hebereke, we shall meet again, my beloved."  He stood there paralyzed.  She jumped out of his arms and disappeared  over the rooftops, scattering black roses behind her, laughing manically as she  disappeared from sight.</p><p>The paralysis wore off  quickly.  Ranma jumped up to the roof  and found Akane.  She was furious.  She couldn't decide though if she was madder  because of the attack, or because Kodachi had kissed Ranma.  Ranma gathered Akane in his arms, and then  leapt down to the ground.  They entered  the house and went back upstairs to bed.</p><p>Akane, Ranma and Ryoga spent the  next two days practicing the skills for the gymnastics meet, Ranma practicing  to be Akane's second.  Each evening,  Ranma would check out Akane's room before she would enter, just to make sure  there wasn't a repeat performance.</p><p>The day of the match, Ranma, Ryoga  and Akane went to the gym at St. Hebereke for the match.  Her family and a host of well-wishers from  the high school joined them.  As they  walked in, they met Kodachi.  She walked  over to Akane and held out her hand, saying, "May the best person win."  Ranma grabbed her hand, turned it over and  displayed several thumbtacks concealed between her fingers.  Kodachi blushed, and said, "I wonder how  those got there.  Anyway, your dressing  room is over there."  Kodachi pointed to  a door.  Ranma opened the door.  There on the table was a bouquet of black  roses.  Ranma tossed one of his clubs at  the roses.  As soon as the club touched  the roses, some sort of gas began coming out of them.  He waited, the gas dissipated.   Eventually, he went in and checked out the rest of the room.  He left and waited outside until Akane came  out dressed in her leotard.  Ryoga went  to stand next to the Tendos.  They heard  the announcer call for attention.</p><p>"Testing, 1 2 3, testing.  Welcome everyone to the St. Hebereke Martial  Arts Gymnastic Challenge.  Today we will  see Akane Tendo representing Furinkan High School fight against our own beloved  Kodachi Kuno, the Black Rose," the announcer said.</p><p>"Kuno!" Akane and Ranma both  exclaimed.</p><p>"Please welcome the challenger to  the ring," the announcer called.   Hearing their cue, Akane and Ranma walked out, Akane climbing into the  ring, Ranma taking his station in their corner.  "Now, please welcome the reigning champion of Martial Arts  Gymnastics, Kodachi Kuno, the Black Rose of St. Hebereke High School," he  declared.  A trapeze began to descend  from the ceiling, Kodachi sitting upon it wearing a white bridal gown.</p><p>She called, "Ranma, my beloved, I  wear my wedding dress for you, dear."</p><p>Akane began to see red.  "Ranma, what does she mean by that?"</p><p>Ranma said, "I have no idea.  Do me a favor and hit her a bunch of times  for me, will ya?  She ain't my  fiancée!"</p><p>Kodachi landed in the ring, threw  off the wedding dress to appear dressed in a black leotard.  She called to her second for her hoop.  Akane got two of her clubs.  The bell rang and the fight was on.  Kodachi threw her hoop at Akane, Akane  dodged, putting one of the clubs in the way of the hoop.  The hoop cut the club in half, and landed  next to Ranma.  "Hey, ref, this hoop is  a razor," Ranma called, "Surely that's not legal."</p><p>The referee turned to him and said,  "Any tool she has is legal.  Those are  the rules.  You can only hit someone  with one of the tools is the only restriction in this match."</p><p>Akane threw what was left of her  club at Kodachi.  Kodachi leapt to avoid  it and landed by the ropes.  Kodachi  lashed at Akane with her ribbon.  Akane  caught it with her leather-gloved hand, and began to pull Kodachi to the center  of the ring.  Kodachi frowned in  surprise; no one had ever been able to do this before to her.  Akane pulled even harder, and Kodachi lost  hold of the ribbon.  Akane tossed that  behind her to the ring floor.  Then  Kodachi called for her clubs and grabbing them, called out "Attack of the  thousand clubs".  She charged Akane,  whirling her clubs around making it look like there were a thousand clubs.  As she got nearer, Akane threw her club into  the middle of the clubs, disrupting Kodachi's rhythm.  About twenty clubs flew out of the ring, barely missing some of  the spectators.  Kodachi ran back to her  corner, looking for her next tool.   Akane grabbed Kodachi's ribbon, and began lashing Kodachi.  Kodachi jumped up on the ropes to avoid the  ribbon, then jumped back out of the ring.   As she jumped up, she whistled, the ring moved to land under her.  Ranma lifted up the skirt of the platform  and saw the remainder of the Gymnastics Team under the platform.  "Hey, Ref, is this legal?"</p><p>The referee just ignored him.  Akane continued to attack Kodachi with  Kodachi's ribbon.  Finally, she cornered  Kodachi on the ropes again.  This time  when Kodachi sprung back, Ranma was ready.   As Kodachi whistled, he threw a bunch of marbles in the way of the  girls.  They fell down, slipping and  sliding and the ring stayed put.   Kodachi fell outside of the ring, knocking herself out.</p><p>The announcer cried out, "In a  stunning victory, the challenger, Akane Tendo has defeated the champion,  Kodachi Kuno, breaking her undefeated streak at one hundred matches."  The crowd from Furinkan came running over to  congratulate Akane.  Finally, bruised  and battered, Kodachi walked over and congratulated Akane.</p><p>"Ranma, darling, I can not bear for  you to see me defeated.  Please forgive  me for not being able to win you from this peasant," Kodachi said.</p><p>"Ranma," Akane growled.</p><p>"Kodachi, I'm not your  darling.  Leave me alone; I'm not  interested in you.  Go find someone else  to pester," Ranma said.  With that, they  all turned and left, leaving Kodachi spluttering behind them.</p><p>Akane asked, "Ranma, where's  Ryoga?"</p><p>A little later</p><p>"Now, where am I," Ryoga asked out  loud.</p><p>"Just outside of Nerima," a voice  said.  Ryoga turned.  He saw a young man, dressed in some kind of  uniform, with a bandolier across his chest.   In the bandolier were several small spatulas, and a great spatula handle  was visible above his head.</p><p>"Do you know how to get to the  Tendo home," Ryoga asked hopefully, "I got lost and want to get back to see my  friend Ranma."</p><p>"Sorry, I don't know where it is,  I'm new to the area myself.  Your friend  wouldn't be Ranma Saotome, would he?" the boy asked.</p><p>Ryoga said, "Yeah, that his  name.  Do you know him?"</p><p>The boy just ignored him and rushed  off toward Nerima.  Ryoga tried to  follow, but soon lost sight of the boy.</p><p>A figure was shadowing Gemna  Saotome as he walked home from his job at the clinic.  Suddenly the figure rushed him, swinging a huge battle  spatula.  "Saotome", the figure roared,  "At last I've found you, you bastard!"   The spatula swung and connected with Gemna, smashing him into the  ground.  The assailant hit him again and  again in an angry rage.  "Why did you  leave me, Father," he cried.  After  pulverizing Gemna, the figure choked back a sob and ran off, leaving Gemna  unconscious on the ground.</p><p>Akane came rushing over, after  overhearing the last portion of the fight, to check on Gemna.  She picked him up and staggered back to Dr.  Tofu.  After leaving him in the doctor's  capable hands, she walked home, lost in thought.  'What did that person mean by calling him Father?  Does this mean Ranma has a brother?' she  thought to herself.  Entering the yard,  she saw Ranma practicing in the entrance to the dojo.  'He sure moves gracefully,' she thought, 'I wonder if I could  ever move like that?'  She stared,  entranced by the beauty of his motion.</p><p>Ranma sensed he was being  watched.  He finished the exercise he  was doing, and then turned.  "Yo, Akane,  where've ya been?  We were supposed to  work out together tonight right after school, remember?" he said.</p><p>"Sorry, Ranma, I had to stay late,  I thought I told you.  It's a good thing  I did, too.  I stumbled across your dad  on the way home.  Somebody had beaten  him pretty badly.  He's at the clinic  with Dr. Tofu.  But, the person who was  hitting him was calling him Father.  You  don't have any brothers, do you?" she said.</p><p>Ranma looked stunned.  "Not any that I know of, tell Kasumi would  you, I need to get over there and check on the old man," he said.  With that, he ran off.  Akane went in to tell Kasumi, and then went  upstairs to work on her schoolwork.</p><p>Ranma came home about an hour  later.  He met Kasumi and Akane as he  entered.  He said with a hint of  disgust, "The old man will be okay, but he didn't see who it was that attacked  him.  All he knows is that he got hit by  some kind of weapon.  He's going to  spend the night there, and then come home first thing in the morning."</p>
