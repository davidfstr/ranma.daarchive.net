</div><p>Chapter 17 Aftermath</p><p>Ranma woke up early the next  morning after a night of restless sleep.   He lay there for a few minutes, but soon gave up trying to get back to  sleep.  He got up, tossed on some clothing  and walked downstairs.  He crept quietly  into Kasumi's room and saw her still asleep.   He walked over and turned her alarm clock off, gazing down at her  smiling face.  He tore his eyes away,  and made his way downstairs.  He quickly  bathed and then went into the kitchen to begin preparing breakfast.</p><p>Kasumi woke up, refreshed from a  peaceful night of pleasant dreams.  From  what she could remember of her dreams, they had been very sweet.  She stretched, and then looked at her alarm  clock. 'Oh my, how did it get to be so late?' she thought to herself.  Hurriedly, she rose, threw a robe over her  pajamas and rushed downstairs in as close to a panic as Kasumi ever got.  When she entered the kitchen, she stared in  shock.  Ranma was at the stove preparing  breakfast, the bentos for lunch were prepared and the kitchen counters were  clean.  She snuck up behind Ranma and  twined her arms around his waist.  He  jumped in her arms.  She giggled, and  said "Good morning, Ranchan, thank you for making breakfast."</p><p>"G-g-good morning, Kasumi-chan," he  stammered, "It's the least I could do for you saving me last night."</p><p>'Oh, no, he's so nervous around  me,' she thought in panic, 'please don't start acting like Tofu.'  Her arms tightened around him, and he felt  the tremor in her arms.</p><p>He turned in her arms to look at  her.  "I couldn't get back to sleep this  morning, so I snuck in and turned off your alarm.  You looked so peaceful and happy; I thought I'd let you get a bit  more rest.  You looked like you were  having a very nice dream the way you were smiling in your sleep," he said,  blushing as he realized how close their lips were to each other.  "I am nervous, Kasumi-chan, I admit.  Something changed between us last night, and  I don't know how to react around you right now.  I know we can't put the genie back in the bottle, so we can't  pretend nothing happened, but I'm not sure how I really feel."</p><p>She gave him a quick peck on the  lips, her eyes dancing.  She stepped  back and said, "Well, one thing I'm feeling is hungry.  I better let you get back to cooking; it  looks like the miso soup is coming to a boil."   He whirled back to take care of what he was doing.  "Sorry, I distracted you, Ranchan," she said  with a laugh, "I won't deny I'm feeling confused right now myself.  I know I haven't felt this good in a long  time.  Whatever else happens, thank you  for that."</p><p>"There's enough time for you to  soak in the furo, if you'd like," Ranma said, "I haven't heard anyone else  moving around, so it should be available."</p><p>"That's a good idea," she  said.  "Would you like to scrub my  back?" she said with a wicked smile.</p><p>Ranma blushed again.  "Kasumi!" he gasped.</p><p>She laughed as she went into the  bathroom.</p><p>At breakfast, Kasumi served out the  meal to everyone.  Ranma was eating  slowly, looking nervously at Kasumi.   Kasumi knelt there with an odd smile on her face, somewhat like that  pictured in the Mona Lisa.  Looking at  that smile made him even more nervous, but he wasn't sure why.</p><p>Nodoka stared at Ranma, and then  asked, "Ranma, are you okay?  You sure  are eating slower than normal."</p><p>"Yeah, Ranma, are you still shaken  up from last night or something?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Last night, nothing happ   oh, you mean with Kodachi.  Yeah, that's got me shaken up a little.  That's what's wrong," he stammered.</p><p>Nabiki's eyes narrowed as she  thought, 'He's hiding something.'</p><p>Gemna roared, "How could you be  scared about something like that, boy?"</p><p>"No, I'm not scared of nothing,  Pop.  It just shook me up to think  someone would try that is all," Ranma said, "I didn't like not being able to  move, you know."</p><p>Soun said, "Kasumi, breakfast was  excellent, did you do something different?"</p><p>Kasumi began to say, "Father, I  d'  then she noticed Ranma's expression,  and changed what she was going to say, "Thank you."</p><p>Akane was looking very  pensive.  'I wonder what's bothering  her,' Ranma thought.  "Hey, Akane, are  ya gonna be up for training session later?"</p><p>"Maybe," Akane said  listlessly.  She excused herself and  headed upstairs to her room.</p><p>A few minutes later, Ranma thanked  Kasumi for the excellent meal and went outside.  Once he was out of view, he jumped up to the roof and made his  way over to where he could see into Akane's room.  Sure enough, she was on her bed crying.  He jumped back down and went upstairs to her room and knocked on  the closed door.  He heard her shuffle  to the door and open it.</p><p>"Akane, do ya want ta talk about  it?" he asked gently.</p><p>"I don't know, Ranma.  Maybe, come on in," she said sadly.  They made their way into room, Ranma sitting  on the floor in a lotus position and Akane sitting in her desk chair.</p><p>"What's the matter with you,  Acchan?" Ranma asked.  'Acchan, where  did that come from and why did I call her that?' he thought to himself.</p><p>"I'm just depressed.  I thought I was one of the best martial artists  in town before you came, and now even Kasumi is better than I am.  I can't cook.  I'm a tomboy.  I just feel  useless," she said.</p><p>"I don't know why you think that,  'kane.  You are one of the better  martial artists in town.  You've beaten  Kodachi on her own territory; using tools that you weren't really all that  familiar with, remember.  You might not  have been a match for Kuno before I started training ya, but you could  definitely take him now.  In fact, I bet  you could beat anyone except Ryoga, Shampoo and of course, me.  Ukyo relies on her weapons too much, so  while she'd hurt ya, you would beat her in the end," Ranma said, "As far as  Kasumi is concerned, you have more skill than she does.  Kodachi wasn't expecting her to attack; I  know I really wasn't.  There's nothing  wrong with being a tomboy.  You're  certainly not useless, you're as good a sensei as I am, so I don't know why ya  feel so down."</p><p>"Do you mean all that, Ranma?" she  said, her eyes suddenly bright.</p><p>"Acchan, I meant every word of  it.  Now, give me one of those cute  smiles of yours and help me up.  Sitting  like this after falling so hard last night was a mistake," he said with a  chuckle.</p><p>She smiled and pulled him up off  the floor, and then hugged him.  "Meet  me in the dojo, Ranchan.  I'm gonna  change into my gi, and help work some of that stiffness out," she said.</p><p>He smiled at her, glad that he had  been able to cheer her up.  "Now I'm  scared, my favorite tomboy is gonna beat me up," he said as he ran out the  door, followed by the sound of her laughter.</p><p>The next day</p><p>The month long semester break in  August was over, so school was back in session.  After much protesting, Shampoo was going to school with Ranma and  Akane, Nabiki having already left to get Shampoo registered and to start the  betting pools.  All three of them were  balancing up on the fence, with Ranma running behind Akane.  All of the balance training that Ranma had  made her do had paid off.  They were  almost there, when out of nowhere came the familiar cry, "Ranma Saotome,  prepare to die!" as Ryoga attacked.  He  suddenly stopped in confusion, staring at the lavender haired Amazon girl who  had her bonborris across her chest.</p><p>"No hurt stepson Ranma.  You hurt, Shampoo kill!" Shampoo said, her  bosom heaving with exertion.</p><p>Ryoga stared in fascination at the  sight, and then realized what he was looking at.  His nose started bleeding and then he fainted.</p><p>"Oh come on, Shampoo, at least wear  a sports bra," Akane said, "The guys will sit there and drool over you  otherwise, the perverts.  Hurry up or we'll  be late."  Ranma and Shampoo shrugged  their shoulders and ran off with Akane, leaving Ryoga slumped to the ground.</p><p>At lunchtime, Ranma was sitting  outside eating his bento.  Akane, Nabiki  and Shampoo were off talking to Ukyo.   It was a peaceful day, Kuno was nowhere to be seen, Kasumi had outdone  herself with the lunch, and Ranma had actually gotten a better grade on the  last test before the break than Akane had.   All in all, it had the makings of a good day.  Even the episode with Ryoga hadn't been enough to ruin Ranma's  mood.  Of course, just mentioning Ryoga  was enough to make him show up, and sure enough, Ranma saw Ryoga approaching.</p><p>"Ranma, can we talk?" Ryoga said.</p><p>"Uh, sure," Ranma said surprised,  "No, Ranma Saotome, prepare to die, No, Because of you I've seen hell?  Are you sure you're not sick?"</p><p>Ryoga hung his head  sheepishly.  "Not this time, Ranma.  I need to talk, not fight.  There's something I needed to ask.  First of all, was that really you in the  clinic?"</p><p>"Yep, that was me.  I fell in the Spring of Drowned Girl.  I was pretty angry at Pop that morning, I  guess that's why he didn't see ya, the stupid panda.  I feel sorry for ya.  At  least I stay human.  I can't imagine how  ya must feel," Ranma said.</p><p>"Yeah, tell me about it.  It's no fun looking like someone's dinner,  that's for sure," Ryoga said, and then he asked, "Who was that girl this  morning, the one that protected you?"</p><p>"Uh, that's Shampoo.  She's an Amazon that Pop and I met in China  after we were cursed.  Their village is  over by Jusenkyo, so we stopped there for a month.  Pop beat her in a challenge, so by their laws, she's his  wife.  She and I got ta be good friends  while I was there, though it felt funny her always calling me daughter.  After all, we're the same age.  It wasn't so bad when her great-grandmother  called me that.  At least she's three  hundred years old or something.  Why'd  ya ask?" Ranma replied.</p><p>"Because she's gorgeous.  I think I might be in love with her," Ryoga  said with a silly grin on his face.   Ranma face faulted.</p><p>"You've got to be kidding.  You just met and you couldn't have seen her  for more than a second before you fainted," Ranma said in surprise.</p><p>"It surprised me too.  I guess it was that love at first sight  thing.  I'm just so shy around women  though; I don't know how to tell her," Ryoga said.</p><p>"Well, I'm no expert at that,  either.  All I can suggest is that ya  just go and try ta be friends with her.   Maybe she'll like ya," Ranma said, 'Man, he's got it bad,' he thought.</p><p>"Thanks, Ranma, you're a real friend,"  Ryoga said rushing off to find Shampoo.</p><p>"Man, that was so weird," Ranma  said.</p><p>In another part of the schoolyard,  Nabiki asked, "Ukyo, are you busy enough that you could use a waitress now?"</p><p>Ukyo thought for a while, and then answered,  "Yes, I could use someone to help at the tables.  I've got the perfect outfit in mind for you, too, Nabiki."  Ukyo grinned at her friend and partner.</p><p>Nabiki face faulted.  "No, actually I was thinking of Shampoo  here.  With that cute bimbo act she has,  she should be able to make a lot of money in tips.  She also is a pretty good cook, if you want to start expanding  your menu a bit," Nabiki said.</p><p>Ukyo looked at Shampoo, and then  smiled, "Sure, sugar.  If you want to  help out at the restaurant, that would be great.  What can you cook?"</p><p>Shampoo said, "Shampoo think it be  fun.  Get bored sitting at home, nice  girl and sword woman no let me help.   Say Shampoo take care of Airen, but Airen too busy being stupid panda.  Shampoo make too too good food.  Does spatula girl like Ramen?"</p><p>"That's settled then.  Why don't you come home with me after school  and we can start today?  I can't pay you  much, it'll mostly just be the tips, but I think I can give you a little  something," Ukyo said.</p><p>"Just take some out of my share,"  Nabiki said, "After all, she's almost family, you know."  Major face faults all around, Nabiki being  generous!</p><p>"That won't be necessary,  Nabiki.  Like ya said, my cute bimbo  act'll get me plenty of tips," Shampoo said with a sly grin.</p><p>"Huh, when did you learn to speak  Japanese that well?" Akane said.</p><p>"While I was teaching Ranma ta  speak Chinese, he taught me ta speak Japanese," Shampoo said.</p><p>"I can tell.  You sound just like he does, slang and all,"  Ukyo said, "His grammar isn't the best, you know.  But why the act?"</p><p>"Shampoo enjoy it.  Easy to be thought stupid Chinese girl.  Big advantage, no?" Shampoo said with a  smile.  All the girls giggled.</p><p>"Why did you decide to let us in on  the secret, then?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>Shampoo shrugged.  "Like ya said, we're almost family, and  after the training trip, I realized that while our traditions are different,  family and clan mean as much in your culture as they do in mine," she said,  "After seeing that, this secret just wasn't something I wanted to hide anymore."</p><p>"What happened on the trip?" Akane  asked.</p><p>"We trained, of course," Shampoo  smirked, "Because of that, while I still have no great desire to have Gemna as  my Airen, I do feel better about losing to him.  After watching Ranma and Airen practice against each other, I saw  that Airen was a decent martial artist.   When I trained with him, only the fact that I was faster kept me from  getting hurt.  I should have beaten him  in the challenge fight, but I hadn't noticed how tired I had gotten or how much  it had impacted my speed.  I also saw  how much Ranma respected his mother.   That's when I realized his family was important to him, and suddenly,  without my noticing, his family became important to me.  He also missed all of his almost family a  great deal.  He hid it well from Gemna,  but Nodoka and I both noticed.  Nodoka  treated me as an equal, as if I were a respected warrior, and a member of her  family."</p><p>"Are you going to try to fit in  while you're in class?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Are you kidding, with my coloring  and exotic looks, I couldn't hide if I wanted to.  No, I think I'll just play the Chinese bimbo girl.  Besides, it's a lot of fun, and I bet I'll  really irritate all of the senseis!" she said with a giggle.  The other girls joined her laughter.  Then Akane stiffened in anger, frowning as  she saw who was approaching.</p><p>"Ryoga, what are you doing here?"  Akane said, "I'm still angry at you for cutting Ranma so badly the last time  you two fought."</p><p>"Akane, I'm sorry about that.  But that's not why I came over here.  I wanted to apologize to Shampoo here,"  Ryoga said.  Xian Pu, I most humbly  offer my apology for my actions this morning.   Please accept them he said in Chinese.</p><p>"Does everyone but me speak  Chinese?" Akane said in some exasperation.</p><p>Ryoga, why were you attacking  my stepson? Shampoo asked.</p><p>"Because of him, I've seen Hell,  Shampoo.  We were sort of friendly  rivals in junior high, and then he backed out of a fight.  I followed him to China," Ryoga replied.</p><p>"Don't forget to tell her about the  springs, pig-boy," Akane growled.</p><p>Ryoga looked pained.  "Akane, how many times do I need to  apologize to you about your hair.   Please stop calling me that.   Shampoo, what Akane is so crassly mentioning is that I turn into a pig  because of my Jusenkyo curse," he admitted.</p><p>Shampoo giggled.  Ryoga hung his head.  I'm sorry, Ryoga.  I shouldn't have laughed at you.  I can't imagine how you cope with it,  Shampoo said.</p><p>That's all right, Xian Pu.  Could we start over, I'd like to be friends  with you? Ryoga asked, hopefully.</p><p>It would be nice to be able to  talk to someone else in a civilized tongue Shampoo admitted, I guess we  can try.  Ranma is my friend as  well.  Can you be civil to him?</p><p>If it is that important to you,  I will try, Ryoga said reluctantly.   The bell rang to announce it was time to return to class.</p><p>"Oops, that's the bell.  We've gotta run, Ryoga.  Why don't you come by Ucchan's tonight?"  Ukyo said.</p><p>"If I can find it," Ryoga said as  they all ran off to class, leaving him behind.</p><p>Later that day, after school</p><p>Nihao, Xian Pu Ryoga said  as he entered Ucchan's and saw Shampoo.   She waved, and then pointed to a stool at the grill, where Ukyo was  busily making okonomiyaki.  "Hi, Ukyo,"  Ryoga said, "Could I get one of those when you get a moment?"</p><p>"Sure, sugar.  What flavor do you like?" Ukyo replied.</p><p>"Uh, anything but pork," he  said.  He looked around the room.  It was about three-fourths full of  customers, most of them young men who openly stared at Shampoo and Ukyo.  Shampoo was in a very skimpy outfit,  basically short shorts and a t-shirt.   She was busy taking orders and bringing the completed orders to the  tables.  She bounced around the  restaurant, entrancing the men.  Ryoga's  eyes glazed over watching her in action.</p><p>'Uh oh, Ryoga's looking at Shampoo  pretty strange,' thought Ukyo, 'I better warn her.'  "Hey, sugar, here's a squid okonomiyaki for you," she said to  Ryoga as she placed the plate in front of him.   Ryoga jerked back to attention, and then started eating.</p><p>"Hey, this is good, Ukyo, I'm  impressed.  This is one of the best I've  ever had," Ryoga said.</p><p>Ukyo blushed.  "Thanks, Ryoga.  You're not such a bad guy after all, you know," she replied.</p><p>Shampoo came over about the time  Ryoga finished his meal.  Nihao,  Ryoga, she said as she bounced over to him.  Ryoga handed her a small bouquet of flowers, saying "These are  for you.  Pretty flowers for a pretty  girl."  Then his nose began to bleed as  he saw what was happening under her shirt.   He got angry when he realized that he wasn't the only guy in the  restaurant reaching for a handkerchief.   'Perverts' he thought, and then he asked, "How's business?"</p><p>"Business just fine.  Shampoo get many big tips.  Customers all very very friendly," she said  brightly,  "Why Ryoga nosebleed?"</p><p>Ryoga blushed.  "I better go, Shampoo," he said.  He put some money on the bar, and ran off.</p><p>"Shampoo honey, I think he really  likes you.  I saw the way he was looking  at you.  Ranma said he was very  shy.  I bet he came in here tonight to  ask you out on a date and then chickened out," Ukyo said.</p><p>Oh, no, not another Msu  Tse! Shampoo groaned, I thought I got away from that.  Ukyo giggled at the look of dismay on  Shampoo's face.</p><p>"Come on sugar, it can't be that  bad.  He is kind of cute, especially  those two little fangs," Ukyo teased.</p><p>"This is just like in the  village.  Stupid boy named Mousse have  big crush on me and chase me all over village," Shampoo groaned.</p><p>"Arrgh, I blew it!" Ryoga  screamed.  'The love of my life and I  couldn't talk to her.  That approach  didn't work.  Maybe I need to be more  forceful.  Hey, when did they get  pyramids in Yokohama?' he wondered.</p>
