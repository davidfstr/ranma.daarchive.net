</div><p>Chapter 13 Ukyo Moves Out</p><p>Nabiki was in her room working on  her ledger as she normally did every Friday night.  She noticed that several of her accounts were becoming due, so  she made a mental note to visit those people who owed her money to encourage  them to bring their payments current.   She was pleased with the state of the family finances.  Even though she had curtailed her sale of  photographs of Akane and Ranma, the amount of money they were bringing in  teaching students on the weekend had more than offset that.  She had cleaned up nicely at the Martial  Arts Gymnastic Meet and all of her other operations were also showing a nice  profit.  Her college fund was growing  nicely, and she had established new college funds for both Kasumi and Akane as  well.  Overall, she was even in a  position to make some more investments.</p><p>Ukyo knocked on her doorframe to  get her attention.  Nabiki closed her  ledger and motioned for Ukyo to come in.   Ukyo hesitated, and then said, "Nabiki, I need your help.  I appreciate your family allowing me to stay  these last few days, but now that Ranma's mother has moved in, I thought that I  ought to find a new place to live.  I  can't stay here forever after all.  What  I was wondering is do you know of any locations where I might be able to open a  restaurant?  One that has its own living  space?"</p><p>Nabiki thought for a  moment.  "I think I know of a pretty  good spot.  There used to be a  restaurant there once before, and if I recall correctly, it had a small  apartment above it.  I know the owner,  as well; he owes me a few favors.  I can  get a good price for the lease.  What's  my help worth to you?"</p><p>"I think we can  come to an agreement on a percentage of the profits," Ukyo said, "I don't think  I can spare any of the cash I have.  I  will need a lot of it to get the restaurant up and running after all."</p><p>Ukyo and Nabiki  spent the next several minutes haggling about how much Nabiki's help was going  to cost, but they eventually came to an agreement.  Nabiki thought she wasn't getting enough; Ukyo thought she was paying  too much.  That meant it was a good  deal.  Nabiki said, "I'll call the owner  and set up a time to see the storefront tomorrow.  If you like it, we can close on the lease and I'll start  arranging for all of the permits you'll need.   If we need one, I'll set up a crew of people to come over and help set  up the place as well.  I'll consider  part of my contribution, okay?"</p><p>"Sound's good,  partner.  Thanks for the help.  Ranma-honey was right when he said to come  to you," Ukyo said.  She smiled and  left.</p><p>Early the next  afternoon, after class was over, Ukyo and Nabiki met the property owner at the  storefront.  After bowing politely to  each other and making introductions, they went in to check the place out.  The downstairs area was actually in pretty  good shape.  There was plenty of room  for Ukyo to install her grill, there were several sets of tables and chairs and  a dozen booths.  There was a back room  that obviously had been the original kitchen.   It had several sinks, and counters for food preparation, and all of the  appliances appeared to be working and in good shape.  Also, there were two small restrooms on the first floor.  There was a small staircase, hiding behind a  tattered curtain.  They went up the  stairs and found that they ended in a small landing with a door.  Opening the door they found a small living  room, with windows overlooking the street.   There were also two doors, both of them open.  One door obviously led into a bathroom, while the second opened  up into what was supposed to be the bedroom.   The bedroom windows overlooked the back of the property, and the light  shining in through the windows flooded both the bedroom and living room.  While the rooms had been vacant for some  time, a thorough cleaning appeared to be the only thing they needed to be made  livable.  Ukyo nodded to Nabiki, very  pleased with what she had seen.  Nabiki  began negotiating the lease price with the owner; after a surprisingly short  time, Nabiki declared herself satisfied and pulled out a lease agreement.  She wrote in the amount they had agreed to,  and signed the papers.  After the lease  was signed, the owner handed the keys to Ukyo, bowed again and left.</p><p>"I'm glad you were  on my side, Nabiki," Ukyo said with a smile, "I guess there's no reason why I  can't clean this place up and move in here tomorrow."</p><p>"I'll get a crew  over here to help as well.  I have a  locksmith that will come by and change out the locks as well.  There's a few pieces of furniture up in the  dojo attic that you can have until you can get some stuff of your own.  I'm pretty sure there's a least a futon and  a dresser up there," Nabiki said, "Knowing Ranma, if you promise to feed him,  he'll bring them over."  They both  laughed at that, knowing Ranma's appetite.   Then she went on, "I'll catch you later tonight; right now I'll go get  the permit process started.  I have a  clerk at city hall that will do most anything for me."  With that, Nabiki left, leaving Ukyo to  survey her new domain.  Ukyo had noticed  a broom and some cleaning supplies downstairs in the kitchen, so she went down  and brought them up.  She started out by  getting rid of the few cobwebs she had found, and then sweeping out all of the  dust from the hardwood floors.  About  two hours later, Ukyo was satisfied with the apartment.  The floors were clean; the windows were  sparkling.  The small amount of  accumulated trash had been disposed of.   All she needed now was some furniture and it was ready for her to move  in.  By that time, a small group of  students from Furinkan High had shown up, looking for work.  She had them start cleaning the downstairs  area.  With as many people as Nabiki had  sent, it wasn't long until the downstairs was as spotless as the upstairs.  The floors were mopped and polished, the  tables, chairs and booths were clean and shiny and the windows were sparkling  clean.  The locksmith had come and gone  so all that was left was to put in the grill, stock some supplies, hang some  curtains in the windows and open doorways and she would be ready to hang her  sign outside and go into business.   After getting everyone's name to ensure that they would get their first  meal free, she thanked everyone as they left.   She locked up and headed back to the Tendo home for what was probably  her last night there.</p><p>Nabiki met her at  the front door of the Tendo home and took one look at her and said, "You look  beat.  Let's go get you cleaned up and  we can talk while we relax in the furo."   Ukyo just nodded in agreement.  A  long soak in the hot water was just the thing she needed to relax her  muscles.  Even though she was a martial  artist and in excellent shape, all that time on her knees mopping the floor had  worn her out.</p><p>After cleansing  their body, shampooing their hair, and rinsing off with the cold-water buckets,  the two girls entered the furo.  Ukyo sat  there in dreamy silence, while Nabiki talked about her afternoon at city hall  getting the permits.  She said  "According to my clerk, we should have the permits in a couple of days.  Once you have the grill installed, I will  get the inspector in.  That will be the  final step in getting the permits approved.   I don't see any reason why we can't be open next weekend."</p><p>The next day, after  breakfast, Ranma, Akane and Nabiki helped Ukyo move into her new home.  Nabiki had remembered correctly, there were  several pieces of unused furniture that were useful up in the dojo attic.  Kasumi was sewing up some curtains to hang  in the windows and doors and had promised to have them ready that day.  By noon, Ukyo had her grill up and  operational and all the furniture was in place upstairs.  Everyone collapsed on the bar stools in  front of the grill and watched Ukyo christen her new restaurant by making its  first set of okonomiyaki.  After everyone  had some food, they sat around talking and eating.  Nabiki was pleasantly surprised at how good her food was.  'This will work, Ukyo can really cook and we  should get a lot of business.  All we  need to do now is advertise,' she thought.   About the time they finished eating, Kasumi came bustling in, followed  by Gemna, with all of the new curtains.   They spent the next hour or so getting all of the curtains hung.</p><p>Ukyo's eyes were  full of tears of happiness as she looked at her pride and joy.  One of her dreams had always been to open  her own restaurant, and with the help of her friends, her dream had come  true.  She went around and hugged  everyone in thanks, though she couldn't help but smile to herself when she saw  the other three girls bristle when she hugged Ranma.  She deliberately held him for just a moment too long and then said,  "Thanks, Ranma-honey, girls.  I  appreciate all your help."  Kasumi  invited her back for dinner, but Ukyo declined saying she wanted to stay home.  After that, the rest of them waved bye and  left.</p><p>The next day, as  Ranma was walking into the house, Nabiki called, "Ranma, you have a  letter."  Nabiki handed him the envelope  and he opened it.</p><p>He snickered,  "Ryoga challenged me to a fight tomorrow at the park by the lake.  I guess I need to show up there Thursday or  Friday to see if he makes it.  We need  to keep an eye out for him though, there's no telling where he'll really turn  up."</p><p>"Where am I now?"  Ryoga cried out, standing in a dusty street on Friday afternoon.</p><p>A voice said,  "Outside my restaurant, Ucchan's."   Ryoga turned and saw the boy that he had met previously outside of  Nerima.</p><p>"Do you know where  Ranma Saotome is?" Ryoga asked plaintively, "I'm supposed to fight him."</p><p>"Oh, you must be  Ryoga.  Ranma is waiting for you at the  park.  I'm on my way there to set up  concessions if you want to follow me over there.  I'm one of Ranma's fiancées," Ukyo said.</p><p>"Fiancée?  I thought you were a boy?" Ryoga said.</p><p>"Nope, one hundred  percent woman," Ukyo said, "Come on Sugar.   If you don't want to be late again, you need to follow me."</p><p>Ryoga followed the  girl through the streets of Nerima until they reached the park.  There they found Ranma talking to Nabiki and  Akane.  Ukyo peeled off and set up her  okonomiyaki stand with flyers for her new restaurant.  Then she began yelling, Get your fresh okonomiyaki right here!"  Soon she had a large crowd gathered around  the grill.</p><p>Ranma walked over  to Ryoga to try one last time to make him see reason.  He asked, "Ryoga, can we talk about this first?"</p><p>Ryoga replied,  "There's nothing to talk about Ranma, because of you, I've seen hell!"</p><p>"Ryoga, I don't  want to fight ya.  The only thing that I  ever did ta ya was fight ya over the bread during lunch.  I thought ya got over that, after all ya let  me take ya ta school and back, remember," Ranma said.</p><p>"Saotome, enough  talk.  I came here to destroy your  happiness," Ryoga growled.</p><p>"You're too late,  then.  Pop already took care of that,"  Ranma said with a smirk, "All ya can do is ta try and hurt me.  Pop's done more ta destroy my life than ya  ever could."</p><p>"Ranma Saotome,  prepare to die!" Ryoga screamed as he attacked with his umbrella.  Ranma dodged him easily, and ran in and  kicked him in the stomach and hit him in his arms causing him to drop the  umbrella.  Ranma hit him with an  uppercut to the jaw that knocked Ryoga back several feet.</p><p>Ryoga pulled off  several of his bandanas and threw them at Ranma.  He dodged each of them, and as they went by him, knocked them out  of the air.  Ryoga cursed to see all of  his attacks had come to naught.  He  pulled off his belt and straightened it out into a blade and charged  Ranma.  Ranma jumped away, but wasn't  quite quick enough to avoid the stroke.   He felt the blade slice into his side.</p><p>"That did it Ryoga,  now I'm done playing with ya!" Ranma roared as he closed in for the kill.  He leapt over Ryoga, kicking him in the head  as soared over him.  Landing quickly  behind Ryoga, he hit one of the pressure points in Ryoga's arm causing him to  drop the blade.  Then he hit two more  pressure points in rapid succession on Ryoga's neck, causing Ryoga to lose  consciousness.  Ryoga collapsed in a  heap on the ground.</p><p>Akane and Nabiki  ran over to Ranma.  Nabiki asked, with  concern in her voice, "Are you all right, Ranma?"  Then she saw the blood pouring out of the wound in his side.  She ripped the shirt of his back, baring the  wound, paling as she did so.</p><p>Ranma looked at the  wound in his side, and said, "It's just a scratch."  He then sagged into Akane's arms while Nabiki cleaned the wound  with a towel.  She kept pressure on the  cut, with the towel, while Kasumi ran over with her first aid kit.  Kasumi got the bleeding under control and  slapped a bandage on it.</p><p>"Ukyo, bring me  some cold water!" Nabiki called.  Ukyo  ran over with a pail, and gave it to Nabiki.   Nabiki poured the water over Ryoga, turning him into a pig.  "Ukyo, grab P-chan here and his  clothing.  We need to get Ranma over to  the clinic for Dr. Tofu to patch him up," she said.</p><p>As they neared the  clinic, Kasumi took off toward home.   Akane and Nabiki helped Ranma into the clinic, with Ukyo coming up  behind with P-chan.  Dr. Tofu ran over  and helped Ranma into the exam room and asked, "What happened?"</p><p>"Ranma got sliced  open.  You need to take a look at the  wound," Ukyo said.</p><p>Tofu carefully  removed the bandage.  The bleeding had  pretty much stopped.  He began cleaning  the area around the wound to expose a long shallow gash in Ranma's side.  Tofu stitched him up quickly and neatly, and  then placed a clean bandage over the wound.   "Ranma, you need to not exert yourself for a few days to let the wound heal.  Try to stay in bed or at least lying down as  much as possible.  I'll come by in a few  days to check on you," Tofu said, "Now, who did this to you?"</p><p>Nabiki pointed to  the pig who was still unconscious.   "Ryoga here," she said, "He's got a Jusenkyo curse too and blames Ranma  for his life being ruined.  He's almost  as big a nutcase as Kuno."  Ukyo dropped  Ryoga's clothing on the floor.</p><p>"You can change him  back with hot water.  We're going to  take Ranchan home," Ukyo said.</p><p>"Doc, what happens  if I change?  Will the stitches be ok?"  Ranma asked, "As much of a water magnet as I am, I can't imagine not getting  wet."</p><p>Tofu sighed,  "You're probably right.  Put on one of  these gowns, and then you can change and we'll see what happens."  Ranma put one of the gowns on and allowed  Tofu to pour cold water over him.  As he  changed, she felt the stitches move.   Tofu moved the gown out of the way enough to remove the bandage and  inspected his handiwork.  "Everything  looks okay, Ranma, but you probably ought to stay this way until you heal, just  in case," Tofu said.</p><p>Ranma went into the  waiting room and found that Kasumi had returned carrying a shirt.  Ranma put the shirt on after discarding the  gown.  Tofu then joined them and saw  Kasumi.  "K-k-kasumi, what are you doing  here," he stammered as his glasses fogged up.</p><p>"Doctor, you're so  silly.  I brought Ranchan a new shirt of  course.  Nabiki tore the other one to  shreds," Kasumi said.  Tofu began dancing  around the waiting room and then took Betty out for a night on the town.</p><p>Ranma got some hot  water and walked back into the exam room.   She threw one of the gowns over P-chan and then changed Ryoga back.  The shock of the transformation was enough  this time to wake Ryoga up.  Ranma told  him, "Get dressed, Ryoga.  Then you and  I are gonna talk."</p><p>Ryoga asked, "Who  are you, Miss?  Are you a friend of the  Tendo's?"  Ryoga blushed.</p><p>"I'm Ranma, baka,"  Ranma said in disgust, "I thought ya knew that.  And I don't even want to know what made ya blush."  She left Ryoga in the exam room.</p><p>After waiting for  several minutes, Ranma went back in to check on Ryoga, only to find him  gone.  'Now how did he get lost in a  room with only one door,' Ranma wondered.</p><p>"Let's go home,  Ryoga disappeared somehow," Ranma said.</p><p>Somewhere, a  bewildered boy was saying to himself, "Ranma turns into a girl, a cute girl, a  well-built cute girl."  As a vision  appeared in his mind, his nose started bleeding.  "Stop that, she's a boy, arrrrgh!" he screamed, "Ranma this is  all your fault.  I can't believe I was  thinking what I was thinking.  Asking  you out on a date! Arrrgh!  Ranma,  now because of you, I have really seen Hell!"</p>
