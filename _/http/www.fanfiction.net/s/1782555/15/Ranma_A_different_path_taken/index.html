</div><p>Chapter 15 A Letter from China</p><p>Later that same evening, Ranma went  in search of his mother.  His mom had  been extremely quiet during dinner, and had vanished once the kitchen was  spotless.  He found her back in the  guestroom, watching Shampoo sleep.  She  looked up as he entered the room, and then sighed.  She stood up and walked out, motioning for Ranma to follow.  Ranma followed her outside to the dojo,  where Nodoka stood with her shoulders slumped for a moment.  Ranma went to his mother, and put his arms  around her.  They stood there for  several minutes while Nodoka composed herself.   When he felt her straighten up shoulders, he stepped back.</p><p>"Mom, you took the news a lot  better than I thought you would.  Why  aren't you furious?" he asked.</p><p>"Why should I be mad at that poor  girl?  She's just following her laws,  and trying to reclaim her honor.  She  obviously doesn't want to be here chasing him.   Your father, on the other hand, he ran away, again, instead of facing  his problems," Nodoka said,  "Do you  know where he is?"</p><p>"Not really.  I suppose he could have gone to your  house.  He might think he was safe  there.  His things are still here, so he  doesn't have any clothing or supplies, so he can't go too far," Ranma said.</p><p>"That's an excellent idea.  Why don't we go look for him at our house?"  Nodoka said, "I think he needs to greet his wife properly.  After all, she's traveled a long way to see  him and it wouldn't be manly to hide from her, now would it?"</p><p>Ranma and Nodoka came back to the  Tendo home, Ranma carrying an extremely battered looking Gemna, tied up in  several ropes.  "Where do you want him,  Mom?" Ranma asked pleasantly, "It's warm enough to leave him in the dojo."</p><p>"No, I don't want to run the risk  of losing him again.  Take him up to the  guestroom.  Shampoo and I won't have any  problems with him there," Nodoka said.</p><p>Ranma shrugged, and carried his  father up to the guestroom.  There he  found Shampoo still sleeping.  Ranma  dropped his father on the other futon, while Nodoka sat down again to watch the  two of them.  Ranma stared at his  mother; still somewhat puzzled, and then left.</p><p>The next day, at breakfast, Gemna  announced, "Boy, now that it's mid August and you've been out of school for a  while, you need a training trip.  You're  getting soft."</p><p>"Right, Pop.  That just sounds like an excuse for ya ta  run away again.  I ain't falling for  that one," Ranma said.</p><p>"I think it's an excellent idea  Gemna, the four of us can go and keep each other company," Nodoka said, "What  do you think Shampoo dear?"</p><p>"Shampoo want to go, Airen need  watching," Shampoo said.</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>"Oh my, it's been so peaceful and  quiet while the Saotomes have been on their trip.  It's been such a relaxing two weeks.  I do hope they are having a good time.  Isn't tomorrow when they said they would be back?" Kasumi said as  the girls relaxed in the furo.</p><p>"Yes, Kasumi.  Tomorrow is when they said they would be  back," Akane answered, "I still don't understand why I couldn't have gone.  I needed to train too."</p><p>"Now, sister, it was sort of a  family reunion for them, too," Kasumi said gently, "Didn't you realize that's  part of the reason Nodoka went?   Besides, you had to run the classes in the dojo."</p><p>"Yes, I guess so.  It's just that I miss him, I mean, them,"  Akane said, hoping no one caught her slip.</p><p>Nabiki thought to herself, 'Sounds  like Akane is getting serious about Ranma.'   "Actually, Kasumi, I've been bored to tears," Nabiki said, "there's been  no strange people coming to attack Ranma, no new fiancées, no fights that I can  make money on, no information to sell.   Plus father has been so miserable since he hasn't had any one to play  shogi with, that I can't wait for them to get back."  'Well, Ranma anyway.   Though, if it keeps father from crying, then I guess it's worth having  the panda back,' she thought.</p><p>"True, I do miss them, but it has  been nice just the four of us," Kasumi said pleasantly.</p><p>"School starts Monday, are you  ready to start that again, Akane?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Yes, I guess.  I just hope Kuno leaves me alone.  I got used to him being out of my life this  past month.  It was nice that he went on  vacation in Hawaii for a month," she replied.</p><p>"Well, maybe you'll be lucky and  he'll have forgotten you.  They come  back tomorrow, though, remember?" Nabiki said.</p><p>"Did you have to remind me?" Akane  wailed.</p><p>Late the next day</p><p>"Ranchan, there's a letter for  you," Kasumi called as she heard him enter the house.  He came running into the kitchen, and accepted the thick envelope  from her.  He opened the envelope, and  pulled out the contents.  His face grew puzzled  as he unfolded the letter to find that it was a single piece of paper wrapped  around another envelope.  The letter  simply read. "Ranma, please give the enclosed to your mother. Do not let Xian  Pu or anyone else know that you have received it.  Thank You, Khu Lon"</p><p>He remembered his manners and said,  "Thank you, Kasumi-chan.  How was your  day?"  He smiled to himself at how she  giggled every time he called her Kasumi-chan.</p><p>"I received some good news in the  mail.  I got my acceptance letter from  the local college.  That means next  semester, I will be able to take some of the courses that I have had my eye  on.  Isn't that great?" she said.</p><p>He hugged her.  "That's fantastic, Kasumi-chan.  I am so excited for you.  This is the first small step to you doing what  you want to do," he said, "Do you know what you want to take first?"</p><p>"I haven't thought that far,  yet.  I was just so excited about the  letter that I haven't stopped to think about that," she said, "I need to run  this book that I borrowed over to Dr. Tofu.   Would you like to walk over there with me?"</p><p>"Sure, Kasumi-chan," Ranma said,  then he smiled, "After all, what man wouldn't want to escort a lovely girl like  you?"</p><p>"Oh, my, Ranchan," she said.  'Is he flirting with me?' she thought.</p><p>"I'll go run this letter upstairs  and then we can leave," Ranma said.  He  ran upstairs and shortly came down.   Kasumi put her arm through his and they walked over to Dr. Tofu's  clinic.  As she neared the clinic, she  let go of Ranma.  'Aha, she does have a  thing for Dr. Tofu,' he thought to himself.</p><p>As they reached the clinic, the  door opened and a patient came out.  He  paled when he saw Kasumi and ran off.   They entered the clinic and found Dr. Tofu standing in the waiting  room.  "Yo, Dr. Tofu, how're ya doing?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>Dr. Tofu smiled, and said, "I'm  fi   ."   He then noticed Kasumi standing behind Ranma.  His glasses fogged up, and he said, "Why Kasumi, funny to run  into you here, tee hee."  He grabbed  Betty the skeleton and began to dance around the waiting room, babbling  incoherently.</p><p>"Oh, Doctor, you're so silly,"  Kasumi said, "I brought that book back, thank you for letting me borrow  it."  She started to hand the book to  the doctor, but Ranma intercepted it and took it into Tofu's office.  He walked back out, finding Kasumi watching  the doctor's antics, with a disappointed look on her face.  'Why does he always act like this around  me?' she wondered.  As soon as she  realized that Ranma was there, her face relaxed into her normal, pleasant,  slightly vacuous expression.  "Ranma, I  guess I'm ready to go home now," she said.   A frown flickered across her face so fast that Ranma thought he had  imagined it.</p><p>"Bye, Dr. Tofu, see ya later,"  Ranma said as he escorted Kasumi out the door.   She put her arm through his again as soon as they were out of sight from  the door, and held the same arm with her other hand, almost desperately.  They walked a little way from the clinic,  until Ranma noticed that she was silently weeping.  "Kasumi-chan, what's wrong?" he asked.</p><p>"Why does he always act that way  around me?  Am I hideous, a horrible  person, what's wrong with me to cause him to act this way?" she cried.  Ranma noticed that she was getting a bit of  attention, so he picked her up and jumped up onto one of the roofs and went  around to the other side of a chimney for some privacy for her.</p><p>"No, you're not horrible.  You're one of the prettiest girls I know,  and also one of the nicest.  Any guy  would love to have you as part of his life.   I don't know why Dr. Tofu acts the way he does around you.  All it takes is for someone to mention your  name, or for him to see your face, and he goes crazy.  He's perfectly normal around Akane and myself," Ranma said.  She threw herself in his arms and held him  tight.  He could feel her body shaking  in her distress.  He held her tenderly  as she wept.  Gradually, she became  aware that he was holding her.  She  calmed down, dried her tears and put her mask back on.</p><p>"Thank you, Ranma, I seem to be  making a habit of this with you," Kasumi said, smiling weakly, "I'm sorry I'm  such a burden for you."</p><p>"Kasumi-chan, you could never be  burden to anyone," Ranma replied, "I can't imagine anyone thinking that of  you."</p><p>"I imagine everyone is wondering  where I am.  I guess I need to get back  and cook dinner," she said.</p><p>"The heck with that, Kasumi.  If you want to go home and eat, I'll fix  dinner tonight. Then you and I are going out for a movie.  You need some time to relax," Ranma said  forcefully.</p><p>"Did you just ask me out?" Kasumi  said incredulously.</p><p>"Sure, what are friends for,  anyway," Ranma said, with a smirk.</p><p>Ranma and Kasumi went home.  By that time Nodoka had gotten in, so Ranma  first ran upstairs and got the letter and gave it to her, cautioning her not to  let Shampoo know of it.  Nodoka went up  to Ranma's room, and opened the letter.   As Ranma had said, it was from Khu Lon.   It read,</p><p>Nodoka,</p><p>I'm sorry we inflicted Shampoo upon  you.  If I had realized that you  existed, I would have prevented Xian Pu from challenging your husband.  Amazon Law recognizes that your claim comes  first, and Xian Pu is not required to marry Gemna.  Xian Pu has always been a proud warrior, sure of her strength,  but she lacks much in the way of relating to people.  In her arrogance, she did not recognize that.  I had hoped to use your husband to teach her  otherwise.  Please allow her to stay  with you until I arrive.  Do not let her  know that I am coming.  Teach her if you  would about your culture.  She has not  seen as many years as I have, and therefore does not realize that my culture  needs to understand the world around us.</p><p>Tell Ranma that I am proud of him  as well, and hope that I may continue his training.  He is one of the best martial artists that I have met in my three  hundred years.</p><p>I look forward to meeting you.</p><p>Khu Lon, Matriarch</p><p>When Nodoka came downstairs, she  heard the clatter of pots and pans in the kitchen.  To her surprise, Ranma was in there making dinner, while talking  to Kasumi.  He was preparing a  relatively simple meal, but from the way he was working, it was obvious that he  knew what he was doing.  Soon,  everything was prepared and on the stove cooking.  "Ranma, why are you cooking?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I thought Kasumi needed a break,  and I wanted to make sure I hadn't lost my touch.  After all, I did most of the cooking while we were on the road,"  he replied, "Pop could burn water.  He's  actually worse than Akane in the kitchen."</p><p>"Yes, I remember.  I wondered how you two survived," Nodoka  said.</p><p>"Mom, Kasumi and I are going out to  catch a movie tonight.  Would you mind  terribly getting the dishes taken care of?   We kinda want to leave right after we're done eating?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Sure, you two have fun," Nodoka  replied.</p><p>Dinner was a bit odd.  Well, considering this is Nerima, actually  it was pretty normal.  Gemna looked  extremely worried, sitting between Shampoo and Nodoka, especially with Shampoo  feeding him and Nodoka absently stroking the hilt of her naked katana  blade.  Kasumi was extremely quiet,  Ranma kept half an eye on her as she served the meal.  Nabiki and Akane looked confused.  Soun was oblivious.</p><p>After dinner, Kasumi and Ranma got  up from the table and went out the door.   Akane and Nabiki looked a bit surprised.  "Where are they going?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Out to catch a movie, why do you  ask?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"No real reason, I was just  surprised.  I didn't think she was  feeling well.  Dinner wasn't quite up to  her normal standards," Akane said.</p><p>"Oh, that's because Ranma cooked  tonight," Nodoka said.  Massive face  faults all around.  She continued,  "Also, I'm going to need some help cleaning up tonight, then Gemna, Shampoo and  I will be going over to my house for the evening."</p>
