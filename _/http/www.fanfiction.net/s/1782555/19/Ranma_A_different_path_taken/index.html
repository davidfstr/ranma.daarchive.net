</div><p>Chapter 19 The Battle for Akane's  Lips</p><p>That evening, Akane came running  into the Tendo home.  "I'm home," she  called out happily.</p><p>"Yo Akane, you sound happy.  How'd the tryouts go?" Ranma asked from  where he was sitting in the living room.</p><p>"I got the part!  Juliet!   Romeo and Juliet!  I've wanted to  play that role for as long as I can remember," Akane said.</p><p>"That's great Akane," Ranma  replied.</p><p>"I thought you already did that  play in junior high, Akane," Nabiki said.</p><p>"Yeah, but I was Romeo then, I  wanted to be Juliet," Akane replied.</p><p>"Who's supposed to play Romeo?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>"They haven't cast the part  yet.  Kuno was there and he was saying  that only he could be Romeo to my Juliet," she said.  She shivered a bit at the thought of acting opposite Kuno, and  her happiness dimmed.</p><p>"Ranma, why don't you try out for  the part?  It's a romantic tragedy, but  it's got some sword fighting in it," Soun suggested, "I think we have a copy of  the play."</p><p>Ranma thought about it, and then  said, "Let me read through it.  It might  actually be fun, and I don't mind irritating Kuno either."  Akane went and found the book that had the  play in it and gave it to Ranma to read.</p><p>Later that evening, after Ranma had  read most of the play, he went and found Akane.  "I see why you don't want Kuno in the role.  Kissing him would just encourage him.  I'll see what happens when I tryout  tomorrow," Ranma said,</p><p>Akane hugged him, and then said,  "Thanks, Ranma, I sure hope you can rescue me from that fate worth than death."  'Besides, I don't mind kissing you,' Akane thought.  She got an impish look in her eyes, and then reached up and  kissed him thoroughly.</p><p>The next morning, Nabiki woke up  uncommonly early.  Something had been  preying on her mind all night, causing her to toss and turn.  She lay there for a while, trying to  remember what had been bothering her, but her mind was still fogged with  sleep.  'Maybe some tea will help,' she  thought to herself as she got out of her bed, and tossed on some clothing.  She stumbled downstairs and headed for the  kitchen.  As she neared the entrance,  she heard the clatter of pots and pans and knew Kasumi was in there preparing  breakfast.  Then she froze in shock as  she heard Ranma talking to her sister.   His voice had a playful quality to it that she had never heard  before.  Then Kasumi replied in much the  same manner.  Ranma and Kasumi were  flirting with each other.  Her eyes  widened in shock as she realized what had been bothering her all night.  Her sister was coming entirely too close to  the man she wanted.  The occasional  dates that they had gone on hadn't really bothered her too much since Ranma had  been careful not to play favorites and to take all three girls out equally, but  the conversation they were having concerned her.  It sounded like they were falling in love.  'I've got to stop that.  Kasumi deserves to be happy, I know, but so  do I.  We've both sacrificed for this  family and it's my turn.  Ranma's the  only man that's ever made me feel this way,' she thought to herself.  Suddenly, a brilliant plan formed in her  mind.  She knew what she needed to do  right after breakfast, before she went to school.</p><p>On the way to school, Nabiki  stopped at the Dr. Tofu's clinic.  He  looked up in surprise as she entered.   "Nabiki, I haven't seen you since Kodachi attacked Ranma.  What a pleasant surprise," he said, "What  brings you here?"</p><p>"Father asked me last night to  settle our account with you.  Even  though you have been kind enough not to ask, the amount we owed you was  beginning to weigh on his mind," Nabiki said, handing him a small envelope that  he placed in his desk drawer.  "Kasumi  also asked me to return these books that she had borrowed," Nabiki added,  placing several volumes on his desk.</p><p>Dr. Tofu's glasses began to fog up  upon hearing Kasumi's name, but then he pulled himself together and asked, "How  is Kasumi?   I haven't seen her either  since then.  Is she still angry with  me?"</p><p>"She was never angry with you,  Doctor.  She was worried about Ranma and  was upset with your foolishness.  At one  time, she thought it was cute, but that evening it was getting in the way," she  responded, preparing to throw out the hook.   "Since she saved Ranma, they spend a good bit of time together.  It's amazing what having someone to talk to,  to share things with, has done for her.   I never realized how unsatisfied with her life she had been, but now  she's almost like a different person."</p><p>"Just how close are they?" Tofu  asked as the room started to feel colder.</p><p>"That's hard to say.  They've gone out on a date a couple of more  times since then, but to be fair, Ranma has taken Akane and I out just as  often, so I don't think that means anything.   He's just being friendly to us all, I'm sure.  Though it sure was interesting listening to them talk this  morning before breakfast.  I could  almost swear they were flirting with each other," she replied.</p><p>Tofu bowed his head in despair, and  asked, "Have I lost her to him, Nabiki?   Did I drive her away with my pathological shyness?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled slightly and  answered, "I don't know.  She's cared  for you for a long time, I doubt that's changed.  Maybe you ought to talk to her yourself and find out.  You just need to make sure you can talk to  her.  I know, one of the things I  remember is that if you treat her professionally, you stay in control.  Maybe there's a martial arts technique you  use that would keep your emotions in check."</p><p>Tofu looked startled, and then  said, "Yes, I think I know of something I can use.  You're right, if I can concentrate on something else, maybe I can  stay in control around her.  Thanks,  Nabiki!"</p><p>She smiled and nodded.  "It's been pleasant chatting with you  Doctor.  I hope we see you at the house  soon.  I need to run or else I'll be  late for class," she said, as she turned and walked out the door.</p><p>Later, at the Tendo home, Kasumi  was hanging her laundry out to dry when Tofu walked through the gate.  "Why Dr. Tofu, what brings you here?" she  asked politely.</p><p>'Remember, Soul of Ice,' he  thought.  "You," he stammered, not  looking at her directly, "I came to talk to you.  I've been meaning to do this for a long time.  There's something I've wanted to say."  He hesitated, and then said,  "IthinkIloveyouKasumi."</p><p>"What did you say, Tofu?" she asked  in surprise, "Did you say you loved me?"   He nodded not trusting his voice.   "Why didn't you tell me this before, while I was pining for you?" she  said a bit sadly, "I was prepared to forget about you and move on."  She began to cry.</p><p>"Because I was too shy around you,  Kasumi.  You are this beautiful woman  and I was afraid you'd reject me," Tofu said.   'Stay focused Tofu, don't go crazy on her or you'll lose her. Remember,  Soul of Ice,' he thought.  He hesitated,  and then held out his arms.  She fell  into his arms and cried on his shoulder.   "I'm sorry, Kasumi.  Please don't  cry.  I'll leave if you want me to," he  said, breathing in the scent of her hair.</p><p>"Don't you dare leave me, now,  Tofu!" she exclaimed, her arms tightening around him, "I waited a long time to  hear those words.  Why are you telling  me now when I had about given up hope?"</p><p>"I was afraid that I had driven you  away, toward someone else, but Nabiki gave me the courage to come talk to you,  to tell you how I feel," Tofu replied, "To find out how you feel."</p><p>"I love you, as well, I have for a  long time.  But I thought you had  rejected me, so I was ready to give my love to someone else," she replied  softly.</p><p>"Ranma?" he asked.</p><p>"Ranma," she replied, "The two of  us have become good friends, and we were drifting into something more."</p><p>"Then is it too late for this?" he  asked, nervously, as he took a small box from his jacket pocket and opened it,  showing a ring.  "Will you marry me,  Kasumi Tendo?" he asked.</p><p>She gasped and said, "This is  extremely sudden, Tofu.  I need some  time to think about this.  I'm not ready  to become a housewife, I want to do more with my life than just wear an apron."</p><p>"Why would you think I want a  housewife?  I know that you want to  study medicine.  I think that's a wonderful  plan!  I'd love for you to be my partner  at the clinic as well as my wife," he said.</p><p>"That was my dream, Tofu," she  replied, "Can I think about it and answer you tonight?"</p><p>He nodded and then grabbing his  courage in both hands, he kissed her, pouring out his feelings through his  lips.  She responded ardently, kissing  him back passionately.  She felt her  body begin to tingle.</p><p>She reluctantly pulled away, and  then said, breathlessly, "Oh my, that was interesting.  I really need to think about this.  Please, come back tonight and I'll give you  my decision."</p><p>Tofu nodded, and then hugged her one  more time.  He bowed and left.</p><p>"Oh my, oh my!" she said, eyes lost  in thought.</p><p>That afternoon, Ranma stood  nervously on stage, wearing a bokken, staring up at the empty balcony.</p><p>Akane, playing Juliet appeared  above on the balcony.</p><p>Ranma began speaking his part,  saying, "But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?  It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,  who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid art far more fair  than she:  Be not her maid, since she is  envious; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it;  cast it off.  It is my lady. Oh, it is  my love!  O, that she knew she were!  She speaks yet she says nothing: what of  that?  Her eye discourses; I will answer  it.  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she  speaks:  Two of the fairest stars in all  the heaven, having some business, do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their  spheres till they return.  What if her  eyes were there, they in her head?  The  brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, as daylight doth a lamp; her  eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would  sing and think it were not night.  See,  how she leans her cheek upon her hand!   O, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might touch that  cheek!"  'Oh man, this sounds like  something Kuno would say,' he thought, 'I could never talk like this to a  girl.'</p><p>Akane said, blushing, "Ay me!"</p><p>Ranma replied, "She speaks:  O, speak again, bright angel! For thou art  as glorious to this night, being o'er my head as is a winged messenger of  heaven.  Unto the white-upturned  wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the  lazy-pacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air."  He gazed lovingly upon Akane's face.</p><p>"O Romeo, Romeo!  Wherefore art thou Romeo?  Deny thy father and refuse thy name; or, if  thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I'll no longer be a Capulet," Akane  cited with passion in her voice.</p><p>Ranma replied, in a low voiced  aside, "Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"</p><p>Akane quoted her next lines,  saying, "Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a  Montague.  What's Montague?  It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face,  nor any other part belonging to a man. O, be some other name!  What's in a name?  That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet;  so Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he  owes without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, and for that name which is no  part of thee take all myself."</p><p>Ranma said, "I take thee at thy  word: Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; henceforth I never will be  Romeo."</p><p>The director said to himself, "He's  doing a good job with this scene.  The  emotion seems to be true.  I think   "</p><p>At that moment, Kuno came bursting  onto the stage, proclaiming, "None shall play opposite the beauteous Akane  Tendo save I, Tatewaki Kuno, upperclassman, the Rising Star of Furinkan High,  the undefeated champion, also known as the Blue Thunder!"  Fortunately, they were inside, so the  lightning flash went unobserved.</p><p>"Kuno, this is my tryout!  However, I don't have a problem doing the  scene with Tybalt now that you're here!" Ranma said, as he quoted from Act III,  Scene 1, "Alive, in triumph! And Mercutio slain!  Away to heaven, respective lenity, and fire-eyed fury be my  conduct now!  Now, Tybalt, take the  villain back again, that late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul is but a  little way above our heads, staying for thine to keep him company: either thou,  or I, or both, must go with him.</p><p>Kuno said, "What?"</p><p>"That's not your line, Baka, you're  supposed to say 'Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, shalt with  him hence'," Akane said from the balcony.</p><p>Ranma said his next line, "This  shall determine that."  He drew his  bokken and began attacking Kuno.  Kuno  jumped back startled at the ferocity of the attack, and then drew his  bokken.  Kuno swung his bokken, however  Ranma parried and drew Kuno's bokken out of line.  Quickly, Ranma disengaged his blade, and struck Kuno square in  the chest, knocking him to the floor.   Ranma courteously stepped back, allowing Kuno to regain his feet.  Kuno's eyes narrowed, and he said, "You are  a better swordsman than I had realized, Saotome.  But you aren't good enough!"   Kuno attacked Ranma again, but Ranma again parried the thrust.</p><p>Ranma smiled, and then said, "Kuno,  you are so predictable with your attacks."   Ranma twisted his blade and Kuno suddenly discovered himself disarmed.  Ranma began chasing him around the stage,  hitting him with the flat side of the bokken, until finally he knocked Kuno  out.</p><p>The director walked over to Ranma  and said, "Ranma, I don't need to see anymore.   You play the part as if you were born to it.  Congratulations, the part is yours.  But when did you learn the script?"</p><p>"Thank you sensei," Ranma replied,  "I definitely enjoyed the last part of the tryout.  As for learning the script, my grandmother taught me an ancient  three thousand year old Amazon training technique that allows me to memorize  what I read.  I used it last night when  I decided to tryout for the role."</p><p>Akane came running from offstage  left, and hugged him.  "Congratulations,  Ranma.  This is going to be so much  fun!" she exclaimed.</p><p>"We start the rehearsals next week,  with the performances in a month," the director said.</p><p>That evening, Ranma and Akane  entered the house after the tryout.   Kasumi called out, "Ranma, could I talk to you?"  He followed the sound of her voice into the  kitchen, where he found Kasumi working on dinner.  "Tofu came here this morning and we talked.  I'm not sure where he got the courage to  talk to me.  We were able to talk  without him acting silly, and, well, he asked me to marry him," she said,  visibly glowing.</p><p>Ranma stiffened slightly when he  heard that.  "What did you tell him?" he  said, a little coolly.</p><p>"I haven't told him my decision  yet, Ranchan.  I needed to think about  what would make me the happiest, and then I wanted to talk to you first.  I felt I owed you that.  You're very special to me.  You've helped increase my self-confidence so  much and made me see that I can indeed realize my dreams.  I do love you, but it's not what I feel for  Tofu.  I want to marry him, but I don't  want to lose you as a friend," she said.</p><p>Ranma hugged her.  "Kasumi-chan, I always knew that if Tofu  ever got up the courage ta ask ya, then I really didn't stand a chance.  I just didn't realize how much it was gonna  hurt when it happened.  I want ya ta be  happy, and I promised when I came here that I wasn't gonna stand in anyone's  way, remember?  If this is really what  ya want ta do, then that's what I want ya ta do," he said, "You better call  Tofu, and let him know."  He turned and  left, not wanting her to see the pain he felt.</p><p>"Oh. Ranma," she said.</p><p>Kasumi went to the door and let  Tofu in after dinner.  She kissed him,  and then said, "Tofu, dearest, I know my answer.  Yes, I'll marry you!"</p><p>Taking the ring from the box, Tofu  slid the ring on her ring finger.  "We  need to find Father, and tell him," she said.   She grabbed him firmly by the hand, and went into the living room where  her father was reading his paper.</p><p>"Father," she said, "Tofu has asked  me to marry him, and I have accepted.   May we have your blessing?"</p><p>Soun broke down crying, "My  daughter is getting married.  I'm so  happy."</p><p>"That went well," Tofu said.</p><p>The next week, Ranma and Akane were  at the school, rehearsing a portion of Act I, scene 5.</p><p>Ranma was saying to Akane, "If I  profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: my  lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a  tender kiss."  'Man, I sound like I'm  flirting with Akane,' he thought.</p><p>Akane responded with her lines,  "Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows  in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, and palm to palm  is holy palmers' kiss."  'I'm flirting  with Ranma!' she thought in surprise, 'no this is just acting, right?'</p><p>"Have not saints lips, and holy  palmers too?" Ranma recited, beginning to really get into the part.</p><p>"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must  use in prayer," she replied.</p><p>Ranma responded, "O, then, dear  saint, let lips do what hands do; they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to  despair."</p><p>"Saints do not move, though grant  for prayers' sake," Akane said.</p><p>"Then move not, while my prayer's  effect I take.  Thus from my lips, by  yours, my sin is purged," Ranma said, then he kissed Akane.  'Oh man, I could really get to like this,'  he thought.</p><p>Akane replied, "Then have my lips  the sin that they have took."</p><p>Ranma said, "Sin from thy lips? O  trespass sweetly urged!  Give me my sin  again."  Akane reached up and returned  the kiss.  'I know I felt something  then,' she thought.</p><p>Akane said, her eyes dancing with  delight, "You kiss by the book!"</p><p>Then Yuki entered, playing the part  of the nurse, and said, "Madam, your mother craves a word with you."  Akane exited, stage right, where she ran  into Nabiki.</p><p>"Hey, sis, you two looked like you  were enjoying yourselves out there," Nabiki said teasingly.</p><p>"We were just acting Nabiki," Akane  said, 'Yeah, right we were just acting,' Akane thought to herself, 'I know I  liked every bit of the kissing.  These  rehearsals are going to be so much fun.   Maybe he'll fall for me.  Don't  stage romances often lead to the real thing?'</p><p>'I don't like the looks of this,'  Nabiki thought, 'Don't stage romances often lead to the real thing?  I don't want Ranma to get too close to  Akane.'  "How much longer will the  rehearsal go on?" she asked.</p><p>"We were just going to rehearse Act  I tonight, this is the last scene," Akane replied.</p>
