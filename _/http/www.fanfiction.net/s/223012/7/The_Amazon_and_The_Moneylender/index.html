</div><p>The Amazon and the Moneylender Part 7</p><p>Ukyou blinked awake and groaned. She had obviously not quite figured out the technique. Otherwise she wouldn't be waking up from daze.</p><p>"Well that was a stupid idea," she muttered, gripping her head. She struggled out of the rope contraption and stood wearily to her feet. "Face it girl, there are some techniques you just don't practice alone. Especially not just because you want to kill a couple of hours." Looking around, she noticed it was daylight. That meant she'd been unconscious for quite awhile.</p><p>"Well, I'm lucky that's all that happened," Ukyou said. "I guess it's on to the Tendo dojo." She pulled out a hand mirror so she could make sure she at least looked clean after lying in the dirt for a while. She regarded her reflection only a moment before blinking and screaming.</p><p>"He's going to kill me," she sighed. "I can already hear the 'I told you so.' This is just perfect."</p><p>Ukyou sucked in her breath outside the door. This was going to be very embarrassing.</p><p>"Oh, hello Ukyou," Dr. Tofu said as the chef entered his room. "What happened to your face."</p><p>"Well, you see," Ukyou started.</p><p>"It looks like you smashed your face into a large boulder."</p><p>"Uhh…It's just a black eye."</p><p>"Yes, but it has a very distinctive shape," Ukyou swallowed as he said it, just what she needed. "I'd almost say you were practicing the bakusai tenketsu technique without supervision, but even Ryouga didn't do that." Ukyou growled.</p><p>"Can you make it go away or not?"</p><p>"Go away? What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"Well, is there a chance that this will be gone by say," she thought about it for a moment. If Ryouga were on his own, she'd have plenty of time, but Nabiki would be there. "Tomorrow?"</p><p>"No, I'm afraid you'll just have to wait for it to heal," Dr. Tofu shrugged, he stood up and took a moment to circle her and probe her head. "Fortunately you don't seem to have any other injuries really."</p><p>"Thank goodness for small favors," she grumbled.</p><p>"Oh, hello Ukyou," Kasumi said as she opened the door to the nervously pacing chef. "Where's Ryouga? And what happened to your eye?"</p><p>"That's…embarrassing, hey where is everybody?"</p><p>"We're all here," the woman answered. "Do you want to speak to Ranma and Akane."</p><p>"As many of you at the same time as possible," Ukyou said.</p><p>"Well then, perhaps you should," Ukyou brushed past her quickly. "come in, oh dear." Ukyou came to the living room and saw that everybody was there. Akane and Ranma were sort of playfully insulting each other near the television while Genma and Soun were playing shogi. Aside from the obvious lack of Nabiki's presence everything was normal.</p><p>"Hey, Ucchan," Ranma called out as he saw Ukyou enter the room. "Is that a black eye?"</p><p>"Huh, yes," Ukyou admitted. "But anyway…"</p><p>"How did you get a black eye?"</p><p>"Uh, I was going to tell you…"</p><p>"Is it Kuno?" Ranma asked, eyes narrowed.</p><p>"No, I have not seen Kuno," Ukyou affirmed. "Anyway…"</p><p>"So how did you get the black eye then?" Ukyou sort of mumbled something.</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>"Bakusai Tenketsu," she mumbled. Then she continued in louder clear voice. "But I was coming to say…"</p><p>"You're taking the Breaking Point training?" Ranma blinked. "Wait a minute, you didn't have injuries before Ryouga got lost this last time."</p><p>"Okay, so I was trying to do it on my own," Ukyou admitted. "But…"</p><p>"You could have asked me to help," Akane suggested. "Or Kasumi, somebody to make sure you didn't get too hurt. Even Ranma could do that."</p><p>"Huh? What's that supposed to…"</p><p>"Ryouga found Nabiki!" Ukyou shouted, tired irritably.</p><p>"Oh, this is wonderful, " Kasumi said.</p><p>"How did that boy find anyone?"</p><p>"Well, she apparently tried to fight Co…"</p><p>"Copycat Ken!"</p><p>"Mousse should have let me finish him,</p><p>"Oh my, is she hurt?"</p><p>"She sounded fine when I talked to her," Ukyou said. "And she's on her way back."</p><p>"Why didn't you say that in the first place."</p><p>"I've been TRYING," Ukyou growled.</p><p>"No offense, Ukyou," Genma noted. "But you don't seem very concerned about Ryouga traveling alone with Nabiki." Ukyou sighed exasperatedly, only Genma would consider bringing up a subject like that.</p><p>"I know there is no way Nabiki is going to try and seduce Ryouga," she said confidently.</p><p>"Actually I was talking about the financial danger." Ukyou looked at him for a moment and swallowed.</p><p>"I…hadn't thought of that."</p><p>"Ryouga, just <i>what</i> do you think you are doing?"</p><p>"I'm looking for my Chinese money," he said. "We're going to have to pay for the plane ticket after all."</p><p>"Ryouga I can…" Nabiki's eyes popped wide as the first bundles of money started appearing.</p><p>"Ahh, here they are," he said. "What were you saying?"</p><p>"Oh, nothing, though I hope you don't mind that I made a few calls with your phone on our way here," she said, eyeing the bundles he was replacing. Ryouga regarded her suspiciously. At least she was acting normal again, that meant he had to watch himself of course. Of course, this was Nabiki, keeping an eye open wouldn't be very much help. "The counter is the other way."</p><p>"Oh, heh," he sweatdropped and then stepped into line. Looking back Nabiki was still eyeing him speculatively, scratching at the edges of the bandage on her face. He grinned nervously and sweatdropped.</p><p>"Sir," the counter attendant said in Chinese. "May I help you?"</p><p>"Two tickets to Tokyo, please," he answered. The attendant's mouth dropped as Ryouga started laying down the cost of the tickets in large bills.</p><p>"Where do you get your money?" Nabiki asked him politely.</p><p>"Inheritance."</p><p>"Stop," Ryouga halted in mid step. "Maybe it would be better if I took the lead perhaps?"</p><p>"Errr…heh."</p><p>"Now, on to more important matters," Nabiki pulled a calculator out of somewhere, probably related to the same dimensional pocket where mallets and bandannas resided.</p><p>"What you doing here?" Shampoo asked irritably. Ukyou arched an eyebrow as she cast her eye about the competition. "What happen to face?"</p><p>"Not this again."</p><p>"Kuonji-san, you look like you lost a fight."</p><p>"Either that or that's the biggest hickie I've ever seen," Kodachi laughed.</p><p>"None of those are in view," Ukyou retorted, then turned beet red.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Never mind, what I was…"</p><p>"You seem to have acquired Ranma's foot in mouth disease," Mousse noted.</p><p>"Can we just forg…"</p><p>"So what DID happen?"</p><p>"Ukyou," the chef rounded on the short, ancient Amazon. "Has Ryouga been teaching you the Bakusai Tenketsu?"</p><p>"How did….?"</p><p>"I've been training Amazons for nearly my entire three hundred years," the old-ghoul cackled. "You learn to recognize the signs."</p><p>"She should no know breaking point."</p><p>"Ryouga has mastered the technique beyond anything I have heard of," Cologne noted. "It is his to teach as he sees fit, but perhaps she shouldn't be trying to practice without someone to watch her."</p><p>"Alright, alright, so I was stupid!"</p><p>"And what were you here for anyway, girl," Cologne asked. "It most certainly wasn't to embarrass yourself. This could have something to do with Nabiki returning?"</p><p>"How did you…?"</p><p>"You can feel it," Cologne said, nebulously. In truth she could tell by the hidden flurry of activity in Nabiki's network, but Cologne liked to give everything a mystical appearance.</p><p>"Why you bother telling us," Shampoo hmphed.</p><p>"Yes, she is coming back," Ukyou confirmed, eyeing Shampoo. "Ryouga found her in China…fighting with Ken." Shampoo dropped her platter. "Yeah, she really doesn't care." Ukyou thought sarcastically.</p><p>"Oh, stupid money-girl," Shampoo snapped.</p><p>"Nabiki Tendo…fighting?" Kodachi blinked.</p><p>"That would be like one us trying to take over Sony."</p><p>"Was she seriously hurt?" Cologne inquired.</p><p>"She sounded fine," Ukyou said. "Ken's dead."</p><p>"Good, the little-imitator deserves that," Kodachi hmphed.</p><p>"Well, this will make our task a little more difficult," Cologne sighed. "But it is good news nonetheless."</p><p>"Yeah, just thought you should know," Ukyou waved, about to leave and then paused and turned around. "Wait a minute, he works here, they live here, and why are <i>you</i> always here now?"</p><p>"Just <i>what</i> are you talking about," Kodachi demanded.</p><p>"We double-check food while she here."</p><p>"Yes, it is getting moderately nerve-racking."</p><p>"You've never found anything," Mousse noted.</p><p>"Never mind, I don't have the time right now," Ukyou said walking out waving her hands dismissing the situation.</p><p>"Well, I never," soon after the chef left, a school girl walked in. Yuka smiled as she walked up to Cologne.</p><p>"You don't seem to be here for the food, girl," Cologne said.</p><p>"Actually, I'd like a ramen special, to go please," the girl directed an envelope towards Cologne. "The chief gave me a message for you."</p><p>"I see," Cologne took it and opened the envelope, reading the contents. "Thank you, Shampoo see to her ramen please."</p><p>"Yes, great-grandmother," Shampoo grumbled. "Stupid money-girl not send me letter." Kodachi and Mousse eyed the envelope curiously, wondering just what correspondence Nabiki could have with the old ghoul. Any cooperation between those two was likely to be incredibly dangerous.</p><p>"Intriguing," Cologne said, "I'll agree to meet with her."</p><p>"Sugoi," Yuka smiled wider as she smelled her ramen on its way. "Arigatou." She waved upon leaving the restaurant.</p><p>"You're busy today," Kodachi noted. A bowl of ramen appeared in front of her. "What's this?"</p><p>"As long as you are here you should at least look like a customer," Cologne noted.</p><p>"Thank you, I think," Kodachi and Mousse glanced at each other and then the bowl of ramen. As Cologne walked off she muttered. "What goes around comes around?"</p><p>"I wouldn't put it past her," Mousse said. They both glanced at the bowl of ramen suspiciously.</p><p>"Are you sure this is going to work?"</p><p>"Well, it works better before the bruise develops," Akane admitted. "But it couldn't hurt."</p><p>"So you've done this before?" Ukyou asked.</p><p>"Actually, no," Ukyou lifted the steak off her face to stare at Akane. "I've seen Ranma do it though."</p><p>"You're telling me that this is a RANMA plan?"</p><p>"Hey," Akane snorted. "Considering how many fights he gets in you'd think he'd know something about this."</p><p>"Okay, that's a good point," Ukyou admitted.</p><p>"And why are you so concerned anyway," Akane asked.</p><p>"I do have my pride."</p><p>"Well, just put the meat back over your face and let that bruise soak."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Ukyou grumbled.</p><p>"So why aren't you worried about Nabiki and Ryouga traveling together?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Uh…" Ukyou tried to come up with a good answer that didn't involve telling Akane that her sister had a thing for Shampoo.</p><p>"I mean none the girls around her a very good when it comes to jealousy," Akane thought about that for a moment. "Well except for Kasumi."</p><p>"When has Nabiki ever shown the slightest amount of interest in any of the guys around here?" Ukyou asked. "And as for Ryouga, he's way too…."</p><p>"Naïve?"</p><p>"Well close enough."</p><p>"Hey, Ucchan," Ukyou waved cheerfully as she saw Ranma and Akane walking outside the Tendo dojo. Akane had been right, the bruise had come down a little, it was still there, maybe he wouldn't recognize the source. Then she could make a less embarrassing story.</p><p>"Hey guys," she looked around. "Anybody seen Shampoo."</p><p>"Why would she want to come?"</p><p>"Oh, no reason."</p><p>"Hmm, something smells like beef." Ukyou blinked and sniffed the air. Then she glared at the sweatdropping Akane.</p><p>"Thanks for the advice, by the way."</p><p>"Uh….no problem," Akane said nervously.</p><p>"Okay, what'd I say now?"</p><p>"Let's just get to the airport," Ukyou snapped. "Okay?"</p><p>"Ah, terra firma," Nabiki said happily. She maintained her grace and dignity despite the stiffness left over from various cuts and bruises.</p><p>"This is Japan right?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"Of course it is," Nabiki hmphed. "And if I'm not mistaken that girl with the sunglasses over there is Ukyou." The crowd cleared a little, and then they could see everybody there waiting for them. Well, Ukyou, Ranma and the Tendos at any rate.</p><p>"I wonder why she's wearing sunglasses," Ryouga wondered. Nabiki sighed irritably.</p><p>"Hey guys," Ukyou called out cheerfully, if somewhat nervously. Ryouga arched an eyebrow trying to see past the sunglasses.</p><p>"Oh NABIKI!" The middle Tendo had just enough time for her eyes to pop wide before her father glomped her. "You've come home!" The man let loose with the water works, threatening to drown the lot of them.</p><p>"Oh, Father is so happy," Kasumi sighed.</p><p>"Hey, Mr. Tendo you're crushing her!" Ranma shouted.</p><p>"Dad, let go!"</p><p>"It is so GOOD to see you home, safe and sound."</p><p>"I'm happy to be home too, Daddie," Nabiki gasped. "Now perhaps….you can put me down?"</p><p>"Does anybody smell beef?" Ryouga asked, and the turned to see Ukyou growling. "What did I say?"</p><p>"Long story?" Ukyou glared at where Akane and Ranma were trying to pry her father off her sister. When they finally succeeded, the four of them went flying over the airport floor and into the other people around them.</p><p>"Well, thus concludes the downfall of my dignity," Nabiki grumbled, dusting herself off. "Ukyou, what <i>did</i> you do to your face?"</p><p>"If you don't get off of me right now…" Ukyou let it trail off. Nabiki shrugged and stood up, getting a little help from Kasumi as she did. Apparently the eldest sister was the only one to escape the tumble.</p><p>"Please do not get paranoid on me now," Nabiki lectured, enjoying the chance to tease Ukyou a little. The chef had certainly been rather annoying to her of late. Ukyou grabbed her sunglasses and stood up glaring at the middle Tendo.</p><p>"Okay," Ranma asked as he dusted himself off. "What was that about?"</p><p>"Don't ask me," Akane commented. "I think it is perfectly logical to be paranoid of Nabiki."</p><p>"Thanks for the kind note, sis," Nabiki rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Ack!" Ryouga shouted and pointed to Ukyou as she slipped on her sunglasses. "What happened to you?"</p><p>"Grrr…"</p><p>"Oh, uh we were sparring," Akane said. Ukyou glanced at her confused before catching on.</p><p>"Oh yeah, that's right."</p><p>"Sparring? That's n…" Akane and Ukyou snapped glares at Ranma and Kasumi sort of stared at him. Nabiki, not knowing what was going on, shrugged and answered the unspoken call for female solidarity. "Yeah, Akane got lucky."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Akane demanded icily.</p><p>"Ukyou never saw it coming," Ranma suggested, cautiously.</p><p>"Are you saying I'm a weak martial artist?" Ukyou growled.</p><p>"But…"</p><p>"Did you just insult Ukyou, Ranma?"</p><p>"Would you all just leave me alone?" And everybody laughed. "Ha ha, very funny."</p><p>"Hmm, you two should be more careful <i>sparring</i>," Nabiki commented in manner that told Ukyou: "I'm going to learn what really happened, and you can't stop me."</p><p>"Okay, now that everybody is collected," Ukyou declared. "Let's get to our respective homes, Ucchan's is supposed to open in another two hours, and I'll need some of that time to get him home," Ukyou jabbed a thumb at Ryouga.</p><p>"How lost can I get with you right here?" Everybody looked at him and stared.</p><p>"Ryouga," Ranma started. "Do you seriously want one of us to answer that?"</p><p>"Uh…..no."</p><p>"Has anyone figured out where the beef smell is coming from yet?" Soun asked. They had to restrain Ukyou from attacking him.</p><p>Shampoo yawned and blinked clear her eyes as she woke up. It was time to get up and get the restaurant ready for business. She walked wearily into the front room after getting dressed, walked past the dining area to get some dishes ready and turn on the ovens.</p><p>Before Shampoo reached anything she walked back and looked into the dining room again. At first she thought that she was just more tired than she had originally thought, but there they were. The two of them were still staring at that bowl of ramen.</p><p>"Well, do you think we should try it?"</p><p>"We'd have to reheat it first."</p><p>"Maybe she's waiting for us to do that."</p><p>"You two here all night?" Kodachi and Mousse looked up from the bowl of cold ramen.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I have work to do, Kasumi," Nabiki insisted.</p><p>"One of your friends can fill in for you," Kasumi countered handing Nabiki a cup of tea.</p><p>"There are some things that require a personal touch," Nabiki sipped her tea.</p><p>"They'll just have to wait," Kasumi said. "You're battered, bruised, cut up, and I think you have a sprained muscle or two here or there."</p><p>"I could leave anytime I wanted to."</p><p>"Nabiki, Mother taught us both," Kasumi said sweetly. "Apparently you did not listen well enough to her on the subject of direct confrontation."</p><p>"Ken was a judgement error," Nabiki admitted. She suddenly arched an eyebrow and looked at her cup of tea and then looked up. "You didn…" Nabiki slumped forward onto the table.</p><p>"Oh dear," Kasumi gasped, spilling the tea. "Could someone help me with Nabiki."</p><p>"What happened," Akane asked as she appeared to help Kasumi carry their sister to her room.</p><p>"She must be more tired than she looked," Kasumi shrugged as they left the room. About two minutes later Nabiki cracked open her eyes.</p><p>"I'm in better practice," she hummed, spitting the drugged tea into her trash can. She was gone through the window in moments. It didn't take her long to find Sayuri and Yuka.</p><p>"Pleasant day, isn't it?" The two girls nearly jumped out of their skins, turning to stare at where she had apparently come out of no where.</p><p>"Chief?"</p><p>"What happened to you?"</p><p>"I did something rather stupid," Nabiki commented. "What was the old ghoul's answer?"</p><p>"She agreed to meet with you," Yuka noted. Nabiki smiled.</p><p>"I thought she might, Kuno and Sasuke?"</p><p>"No one has seen them."</p><p>"Interesting," Nabiki noted. "Anything else I should know about?"</p><p>"Ukyou Kuonji is learning the bakusai tenketsu."</p><p>"Hmm, that explains some things," Nabiki muttered. "Make a quick search for the finances of the Hibiki family, world wide if you can."</p><p>"Sure, Chief," Sayuri declared cheerfully. She turned to face her leader. "Anything el….where'd she go." Yuka looked up from her soda.</p><p>"When is she going to teach us how to do that?"</p><p>"Is there a reason you two are staring at that bowl of cold ramen?"</p><p>"We're trying to decide of whithered old crone put something in it," Mousse said without looking up.</p><p>"Ah, the fun I miss by leaving town," Nabiki snickered. Kodachi and Mousse blinked, then shivered as a slight chill passed over them. They looked up to see Nabiki standing over them.</p><p>"Nabiki Tendo?"</p><p>"Ukyou did tell you I was coming back," Nabiki asked. "Didn't she?"</p><p>"Yes, but you're traveling with that directionally-impaired barbarian."</p><p>"Public transportation is an amazing thing," Nabiki smiled. "I can solve your problem for you."</p><p>"Really?" Mousse and Kodachi glanced at each other. "How is that?"</p><p>"Five hundred yen."</p><p>"Indeed," Kodachi sniffed. "You can't be serious."</p><p>"That's my price, wait too long and it goes up."</p><p>"You don't really expect us to pay five hundred yen for a little advice, do…."</p><p>"One thousand yen," Nabiki smiled. Mousse blanched.</p><p>"We don't really need help," Kodachi suggested. "We can figure this out by ou…"</p><p>"Two thousand yen."</p><p>"Be reasonable!" Nabiki opened her mouth as if to speak.</p><p>"DEAL!" Kodachi and Mousse shouted</p><p>"Money please," the girl asked. After digging into their pockets and handing over the asked for amount, Nabiki quietly counted the money,</p><p>"Well?" Kodachi sat there tapping her foot angrily.</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, did you want something?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"How do figure out if this is safe to eat or not?"</p><p>"Yes, I'm moderately hungry and sleepy after trying to figure this out since yesterday morning." Nabiki sweatdropped.</p><p>"The solution is perfectly simple," the Tendo told them arrogantly. "Just dump the ramen and make some of your own." Mousse and Kodachi blinked and glanced at each other.</p><p>"Why didn't <i>you </i>think of that?" they snapped.</p><p>"Well, thanks for the…" Nabiki snapped quiet as Shampoo's irritated face popped around a corner. "…Shampoo." The amazon glanced at her and for brief moment Nabiki could have sworn she saw Shampoo's face soften. Then the irritated expression returned.</p><p>"Stupid money-girl should be home in bed," the amazon snapped. "Not bugging Shampoo."</p><p>"You sound like my sister," Nabiki sniped, well Shampoo was still angry at her. "Where's Cologne."</p><p>"Great-grandma in back," Shampoo answered.</p><p>"Why are you talking to that old crone?" Kodachi demanded. Nabiki smiled slyly at her.</p><p>"Well now, that is an interesting question, tell me when you figure it out." Then Nabiki walked to the back of the restaurant.</p><p>"Not stay too long," Shampoo ordered her. Nabiki turned towards Shampoo, but noticed Kodachi and Mousse looking on. Those two were bound gossip a little too much for Nabiki's taste. The Tendo girl settled for shrugging her shoulders unconcernedly.</p><p>Cologne was sitting down across from her and Shampoo's television smoking her pipe and just waiting quietly. She looked up as Nabiki walked in and stiffly sat down.</p><p>"You appear to have been caught in a rock-slide," Cologne noted, laughing.</p><p>"How very observant of you," Nabiki retorted irritably. "But I don't think we have much time."</p><p>"Before you make your offer," Cologne exhaled a fine cloud of smoke. "What is your interest in this affair?"</p><p>"Quite simply, I want to see both my sister and Shampoo happy."</p><p>"How is Shampoo your concern?" Nabiki smiled and laughed quietly.</p><p>"I've already told you, happy customers spend more money."</p><p>"As you wish," Cologne shrugged. "What is this plan of yours." Nabiki retrieved a small flask from her pocket and opened it.</p><p>"There is some risk to this plan," Nabiki admitted as she poured a small stream of water out of the bottle. The water rolled over a spoon, which warped, twisted and split, leaving behind two spoons. "It has been proven in the past that mixing springs has unpredictable effects."</p><p>"How very interesting," Cologne smiled. "And would you perhaps have any other types of water?"</p><p>"Of course," Nabiki smiled. "But one thing at a time, Ranma will obviously know something is going on. If it is known that Jusenkyo water is in Nerima?"</p><p>"If this works, both our families should be happy," Nabiki didn't finish the thought. "Assuming Ranma has any feeling at all for Shampoo."</p><p>"As you said, this could have unexpected results," Cologne shrugged. "But it is an acceptable risk considering the possible gain. How shall we go about the implementation?"</p><p>The sound of laughter drifted quietly back into the dining room.</p><p>"We need to keep an eye on them," Mousse decided.</p><p>"Do they really think that they're pathetic plotting can thwart the Black Rose?" Kodachi asked. "OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!" A rag flew through the air and covered Kodachi's face.</p><p>"Crazy-girl scaring all customer!"</p><p>Nabiki smiled predatorily as she walked out of the cat café unnoticed.</p><p>"Wow, the lost boy is back already," Hiroshi commented as he caught sight of Ryouga wondering the back rooms of Ucchans.</p><p>"Damn," Daisuke muttered. "I was hoping for at least a month of fantasizing about Ukyou without him getting in the picture."</p><p>"Excuse me?" They looked up to see Ukyou, and prepared to die. "Can I take your order?" They both visibly relaxed.</p><p>"How about that beef okonomiyaki that smells so…" Ukyou growled at him. "Did I say something wrong?" The spatula came out.</p><p>"Run….NOW!" They didn't argue. In their rush they collided with someone on the way out.</p><p>"Uh sorry, but we have to…" Daisuke shut up as he saw just who he had knocked down. Nabiki glared up at them. "But, but…sorry." The two attempted to break the sound barrier in their retreat.</p><p>"Nabiki?" Ukyou saw the girl irritably trying to stand up. "Do you need a hand?"</p><p>"Hey, Ukyou! Where's the dining room?"</p><p>"I'll be there in a moment, Ryouga!"</p><p>"If you please," Nabiki grumbled reaching out to take Ukyou's offered hand up. "I'm all right if I can get to my feet."</p><p>"I didn't notice you until you hit the ground," Ukyou said. "Shouldn't you be in bed or something?"</p><p>"Everybody seems to think so," Nabiki grumbled, she took a moment and nearly fell again. "Though, I think I'll sit for a moment."</p><p>*CRASH*</p><p>"I found the closet…" Ryouga's voice called out. "Ouch."</p><p>"Okay I have to go find Ryouga," Ukyou said frustratedly as Nabiki took a seat at the counter. "So I'll be right back."</p><p>"Hey, Ukyou," Nabiki said as the chef was starting to leave. "A full minute without acting like I'm going to jump you, congratulations." Ukyou looked flustered for a moment before leaving to hunt down Ryouga.</p><p>Nabiki laughed a little and stretched, all this walking around was getting a little painful. From Joketzoku to the closest airport she had mostly ridden in carts and automobiles, plenty of time to rest for the brief periods of activity in between. Still she wasn't in as bad a condition as she could have been, nor anywhere near as bad as Ukyou was immediately after Kuno snapped.</p><p>"Okay, here we are," Ukyou said indicating the dining area. "Now please just stay in the front for the next little while."</p><p>"So how is your training coming Ukyou?"</p><p>"How did you know?" Ryouga and Ukyou both asked at once.</p><p>"Oh please," Nabiki started ticking points off on her fingers. "You no longer spend all your time plotting to get Ranma to love you, you are a dedicated martial artist, despite recent distractions, and your boyfriend is one of the two best trained fighters in the area. I thought you might be trying to catch up on lost training time."</p><p>"Well, since you put it that way," Ukyou said nervously. "Training is going fine."</p><p>"We've started the breaking point," Ryouga said proudly. Ukyou craned her neck and glanced innocently at the ceiling.</p><p>"So is Ukyou teaching you any of her techniques?" Ukyou and Ryouga had a sudden image of the Tendo girl recording everything they were saying.</p><p>"A little," Ukyou admitted and left it at that.</p><p>"All right then," Nabiki recognizing the signal for silence passing between the two lovers. "I'll have a beef okonomiyaki." Ukyou's eye's popped wide angrily and she quickly worked up a beef okonomiyaki, setting it before the smiling Nabiki.</p><p>"What is it with you and the word beef today?" Ryouga asked curiously.</p><p>*CLANG*</p><p>"You do realize that thirty percent of your customers order the beef okonomiyaki," Nabiki reminded her. "Don't you?"</p><p>"Yeah, I suppose that I can't chase off everyone that…" Ukyou paused. "Wait a minute, how did you know….?" Nabiki smirked at the shocked look she was getting from Ukyou. Here was the proper form of paranoia to be treating her with.</p><p>"Well, that was excellent as always," Nabiki commented. "But I should be getting home soon." Nabiki stood up stiffly, smiling, and walked out of Ucchan's waving to the dazed Ryouga and shocked Ukyou.</p><p>Nabiki slipped quietly into her room and smirked, noticing that the doll she had placed there was undisturbed. Kasumi apparently had faith in her sleeping draught. So it would probably be a while before news trickled back to her older sister and this day's wanderings were discovered.</p><p>"You need to practice more, sis," Nabiki laughed. Nabiki was moderately surprised. Even more so than herself, Kasumi was always there and unnoticed. Of course, when she did make her presence known, Kasumi had an influence that could bowl over king kong. Nabiki had always excelled at intelligence gathering and manipulation. These were areas of their art Kasumi had no real interest in. Still, she hadn't thought that she could fool her sister for the length of time she had.</p><p>Kasumi was right, of course, she did need to get some rest. She stuffed the old dummy, long unused until today, and lay back into the nice, comfortable blankets for some sleep. She was unconscious by the time a figure walked softly from an unlooked corner out through the room's door.</p><p>"Good night, Nabiki," Kasumi whispered quietly. The eldest Tendo saw no reason to dash Nabiki's ego at the moment. The multiple flasks of water that had been transferred from Nabiki's pack to her drawer remained completely unseen by anybody other than their current owner.</p><p>The Amazon and the Moneylender Contents<p>Part 8</p></p>
