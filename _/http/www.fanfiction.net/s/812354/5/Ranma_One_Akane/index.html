</div>Akane Two-Ranma<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>02: ...But at What Cost?<p>Weary after fighting for hours with a panda more than<br/>three and a half times the weight she had as the petit<br/>redhead, Akane had just needed a little rest before-<p>"AAAA! That's HOT!" cried a new tenor voice. It was<br/>a boy's voice!<p>He rose up, not feeling the familiar drop, swing and<br/>dangle of breasts! They had been flattened down to<br/>the pectorals! And those muscles bulged! All the<br/>muscles above the lean thighs had swollen and<br/>lengthened to encase the smaller redhead ones that<br/>Akane had just started to adjust to. The abdomen was<br/>solid; the waist was straight. And the hips were slim,<br/>or seemed so under the broad back and shoulders. The<br/>butt was tight, and, and...something was touching the<br/>ground where nothing should.<p>In shock, Akane Tendou did not look at the men<br/>standing over him, and barely comprehended what the<br/>stocky, muscular, hairless and nude man was saying:<p>Genma Saotome tossed the teakettle aside. Looking down<br/>on the teen now in his son's body, "I expected better<br/>of you, Ranma! Ten years of training ...ten years of<br/>pulling you away from girls ...ten years of knocking<br/>thoughts of girls out of your head ...ten years of<br/>instilling that girls are your opposite ...ten years<br/>of applying the "id-scrub-" (No, you're not supposed<br/>to know about that one)..."<p>Akane cried, "It's growing!" and pushed against the<br/>lap of his shredded white kempo-gi/uniform.<p>Until he realized what he was pressing down: "How do<br/>you make it stop!"<p>That's when Akane looked up-and truly saw the totally<br/>naked man next to him. "AAAAA! Get away from me!"<br/>he screamed, trying to use suddenly taut but shaking<br/>muscles.<p>But his male organ had no problem responding: It<br/>stiffened longer!<p>Genma stared, his mouth open in a pronouncement not<br/>delivered.<p>The Chinese guide shook his head sadly, "Very tragic.<br/>Boy really girl. You know before you bring him to<br/>Juusenkyo?"<p>Genma roared, "NO! This is caused by that "Spring of<br/>Drowned Girl"!"<p>Bringing it out from seemingly nowhere, the Chinese<br/>guide produced his long, ringed placard book, "Nan-<br/>niichuan! There very tragic story of girl who drown in<br/>spring, one thousand five hundred year ago. Since that<br/>time, whoever fall in spring ONLY take body of young<br/>girl." Then speaking more to himself, "I need write<br/>editor of "Accursed Grounds of World". He need publish<br/>revised edition."<p>In his attempt to escape the naked man and the clothed<br/>man, Akane was able to roll as he thrust his tense<br/>slim thighs out to sprint away. Cramp! Seized!<p>He fell. And he fell awkwardly on top of his totally<br/>unfamiliar equipment: "Yow-ch! These things hurt!"<p>Still dazed, Genma's reflex response was his old<br/>speech about, "Be a man, Ranma! Work through the<br/>pain!"<p>Meanwhile, Akane's response was to push his knees<br/>under himself as he attempted to become fetal, "How<br/>can guys stand to have this, this-demon!"<p>That broke through to Genma. He wept. "Ranma, my Son!<br/>What has happened to you?" He clenched his fist, and<br/>closed his eyes. "It, it couldn't be from the<br/>treatment I've been giving you all these years! My<br/>pure fatherly desire to make a real man out of<br/>you...didn't result in the spontaneous reversal of<br/>your manhood because of the shock of becoming a girl?"<p>The Chinese guide said, "Eww, sir! That some side<br/>effect."<p>The hurt diminished enough for coordination-challenged<br/>Akane to make her escape again. But the nearly hard<br/>enemy jabbed into his gi-pants the wrong way-and<br/>wouldn't bend right! He roared, "How can guys fight<br/>with THIS getting in the way!"<p>Genma matched the roar, "Ranma, My Son! Say your<br/>stunted id didn't find its outlet in a girl's!"<p>The Chinese man looking on commented, "Oo, maybe<br/>father get conscience,"<p>When Akane made another, more cautious, attempt to<br/>gain his feet, the naked man grabbed him before he<br/>could get two steps.<p>Genma pulled him around and picked him up by his gi's<br/>lapels and hoisted him into the air, "Say it, Ranma!<br/>You're NOT interested in men!"<p>Akane cried, "I'm not interested in YOU!" and kicked<br/>the man where he as a boy'd been hurting.<p>The naked man nearly dropped Akane as he dropped to<br/>the ground. {Oh, yuck! I touched it with this bare<br/>foot!}<p>Akane's large feet on the ground, now, it was HIS turn<br/>to look down, "And my name's NOT Ranma! If you WERE<br/>my dad you'd know it's Akane!"<p>The bald and naked man clutched her fighting gi rather<br/>than his balls. "I AM you father! Do not deny THAT as<br/>well as your manhood, boy!"<p>Akane fought to loosen naked man's grip on the coat,<br/>"I will deny it, because I'm a girl! I don't WANT to<br/>be a boy-I HATE boys!" {That's it: The demon-down-<br/>there is losing its strength!}<p>Desperate, Genma yanked the body of his son down to<br/>face him, "Remember your heritage, Ranma! You're a<br/>Saotome!"<p>It was Akane's turn to be confused, "Make up your<br/>mind!" Applying his increased strength at the<br/>pressure points of the crazy father's wrists, he said,<br/>"Now you say I'm a rice planting girl!" {Is that what<br/>that drowned red-haired girl was? What HAS that to do<br/>with being a guy!}<p>His hold on the boy slipping, Genma told him, "That is<br/>what you ARE: Ranma Saotome"/rice-planting-girl"!"<p>Akane frowned, wondering about what he heard, "I'm a<br/>wild stallion with a rice planting..." He did not<br/>finish the description.<p>Instead he bellowed, "PERVERT!" as he hit the man<br/>over the head with a wooden mallet.<p>The naked man went down, unconscious.<p>But he hadn't fallen stomach down.<p>= = =<br/>The Chinese man said, "Oo, sir-"<p>Akane told the other man, "Call me MISS!" renewing his<br/>grip on the mallet's handle. The only muscle wasn't<br/>hard was the one he most wanted soft.<p>The Chinese man said, "Oo, miss, you learn one of<br/>Juusenkyo secret!"<p>Akane eyed him suspiciously, "Secret?" {There's no<br/>doubt this place is full of magic.} But then her anger<br/>focused on what was REALLY important: "The only SECRET<br/>I'm interested in is how to get my OWN body back! I<br/>thought once I was finished with your warrior's test,<br/>I could become me, Akane Tendou again! Does this look<br/>like the body of a Japanese GIRL!"<p>The Chinese man said, "You have body of Japanese boy,<br/>just like before you fall into," and he held up the<br/>placard book, "Spring of"-"<p>Akane swung the mallet, and hit the annoying book out<br/>of his hands! "BEFORE I found myself in that, that<br/>accursed spring(!) I was home in my bathroom-In<br/>Japan!"<p>The Chinese man informed her, "You in China, now...,"<br/>and he produced ANOTHER of those long, ringed books<br/>with Chinese characters on the placards, "...in<br/>Quanjing Region of Balakala Range of Qinghai Province."<p>Finished with his blinking, Akane yelled in<br/>frustration, "How many of those do you have!"<p>The man said, "As many as I need. I get same place you<br/>get hammer."<p>= = =<br/>The grown bald man with his clothes on bowed, saying,<br/>"Miss...Tendo? My name is Chorus."<p>At first Akane just stood there in his male body. Then<br/>he bowed, appreciating at least the acknowledgment<br/>that he was really, "Akane Tendou...of the Mushashi<br/>Provence of the Nerima Prefecture, Japan." Then to be<br/>polite, "Mr. Chorus." But as he straightened the body<br/>up, he asked, "Mr. Chorus? That's a...unusual name,<br/>isn't it?"<p>Mr. Chorus answered as he turned to go into the cabin,<br/>"There many unusual name in this part of China, Miss<br/>Tendou.."<p>Waddling after the clothed man into the cabin, the<br/>very stiff Akane demanded, "Well! Are you going to<br/>turn me back to my own self!"<p>He went to one of the two hiking packs and bedrolls.<br/>"I not turn you to anything, Miss. Accursed spring of<br/>Juusenkyo give you body. Only one who tell you why is<br/>one of Guardian of Juusenkyo."<p>Akane asked, " "Guardian"?"<p>Rummaging through one of the packs, Mr. Chorus brought<br/>out a clean and relatively undamaged white martial<br/>arts uniform. "Guardian protect Juusenkyo from<br/>outside. Person, thing come, go they not know." He<br/>turned with the kempo-gi. "Before I come here, I get<br/>their permission, always."<p>Akane saw that the gi was meant for him. He looked<br/>down at the one that he, as a girl, had fought the<br/>naked man, as a panda, in. {Well, there wouldn't be as<br/>much exposed boy-flesh if I put it on.}<p>He took it. {But I'd first have to (Gulp!) strip out<br/>of this one.}<p>Mr. Chorus went to rummaging through the other pack.<br/>"People wish for new body. People want be man, woman.<br/>Some people even want be animal. Spring area be very<br/>crowded, be popular tourist spot, if people know." He<br/>pulled out another, larger, kempo-gi. He turned to the<br/>Japanese boy, "Juusenkyo then not be accursed ground,<br/>yes?"<p>Akane, still holding the boy's gi, said, "Er..., yes.<br/>I guess." {He's saying the Guardians only want certain<br/>kinds of people popping up in their precious springs?<br/>Warrior candidates, maybe?}<p>Akane looked down at the muscular body he was in, now.<br/>{Is, is that why they gave me...this body?}<p>= = =<br/>When Mr. Chorus {If that IS his name.} went outside<br/>with the naked man's clothes, Akane was left to take<br/>change out of the clothes he had on. While he was<br/>coming to grips with the thought of getting a guy's<br/>body naked, she lost the wooden mallet back to<br/>wherever she'd pulled it originally.<p>{Don't think about it, just do it, get it over with<br/>...} an edgy Akane told himself as quivering hands went<br/>to the ties that held the pants on his {warrior's?}<br/>body. A spasm, then a jerk went through him at the last<br/>moment, as HER reflexes fought with the body's-<p>Rip! The pants came off in one tattered remnant.<p>"What does THAT prove!" she told the invisible<br/>Guardians she thought might be still testing her. "My<br/>OWN body would've been strong enough to do that: This<br/>pants and coat are ALREADY rags!"<p>A woman's voice said, "But this is the body that is<br/>NOT cursed."<p>Akane looked towards the square window towards the<br/>back of the whitewashed cabin. Standing on its sill<br/>was a very little old lady with her gray hair done up<br/>in a Chinese bun. Akane thought of her as a lady not<br/>only for the refined, if overly precise, Japanese<br/>dialect she used but also because of her fine silk red<br/>robe with its black dragon writhing over the front. As<br/>another sign of her station was the ornately carved<br/>staff she carried. It was nearly three times as tall<br/>as the woman herself.<p>Akane told her, "This is the body I curse! More than<br/>that cute little redhead you gave me before!"<p>The woman said, "I am one of the Guardians of<br/>Juusenkyo. Our place is not to decide WHO is cursed,<br/>let alone what that curse shall be."<p>Akane cried, "What IS your place? At the betting<br/>table, taking bets over who wins and loses in these<br/>so-called 'Warrior Initiations'! The game is over:<br/>Give me my own brunet, brown-eyed, NORMAL Japanese<br/>girl-body back!"<p>She said, "That is not what we do! And as for what is<br/>your own body-" The small doyen leaped for the<br/>ground a meter and a half in front of him. Akane still<br/>took a step back, not wasn't yet ready to go into the<br/>defend-or-attack stance. She did not see the old woman<br/>as that kind of a threat, yet.<p>She should have: Quicker than he could react, the<br/>ornate staff flew for his testicles.<p>And stopped.<p>Akane shoved the staff away, "What's the idea! It<br/>may've been decades since you've seen a naked guy, but<br/>I'm not interested in-" Akane finally realized, and<br/>saw, that the kempo-coat didn't hang down far enough<br/>to cover the subject.<p>He screamed, "AAA!" and pulled the front of the coat<br/>down (and raising it in the back). His face went red.<p>The old woman chuckled, "It is true. You are, in fact,<br/>a girl. A male would automatically know he had to<br/>protect his..."family jewels"." She raised her staff,<br/>and asked, "How did you come to be in a body that has<br/>not yet drowned?"<p>It took a few stumbling starts before Akane could say,<br/>"I, I thought...you could tell me."<p>"I cannot tell you," from a long, flaring, black-<br/>trimmed sleeve the woman produced, "but perhaps the "I<br/>Ching" sticks can."<p>Akane looked at the ancient red leather container. "A<br/>fortune-telling technique?"<p>The woman said, "That is the true purpose of the<br/>Guardians." She removed the gold cap. "The sticks are<br/>what decided the boy would be allowed into Juusenkyo."<p>She held the open box out in front of her on top of<br/>her palms, as if she were presenting a gift, "I am<br/>called Attar. And you?"<p>Akane was already bent over; and she had no difficulty<br/>deciding to let go of the hem of the kempo coat<br/>pressed up against the opposing sex. She put her hands<br/>out to accept the offering, "A, Akane, Tendou."<p>Madam Attar slid the wooden sticks out onto his palms.<br/>"Akane Tendou, may the sticks recognize you, and give<br/>you...your destiny."<p>Akane almost straightened up, "What?"<p>Madam Attar said, "Unlike what the legends say, the<br/>true purpose of Juusenkyo is to shape destiny. We,<br/>the Guardians, can strengthen or weaken the destiny of<br/>each visitor. But before we can do that service, we<br/>must first know what your destiny is meant to be."<p>Akane could just curl her fingers around the "I Ching"<br/>sticks, "I don't want to know my destiny! I want my<br/>body back-The one I was born with!"<p>Madam Attar said with what look like sincerity, "If<br/>there is a cure for you, it will be revealed in your<br/>destiny."<p>Akane asked, "Cure?"<p>The old woman nodded. "Cast the sticks, and find out<br/>what answers we mortals are allowed to see."<p>Akane thought, {Well, what have I got to lose, I<br/>guess.} and-<p>The voice of the naked man bellowed, "RANMA, my son!"<p>Startled, Akane's hand jumped. The sticks scattered<br/>over the dirt floor.<p>Mr. Chorus said, "Most sorry, Madam Attar! He get<br/>away!"<p>Madam Attar vaulted with her staff, and whacked the<br/>broad man in kempo-gi over his baldhead. "You may have<br/>changed the course of destiny!"<p>Rubbing the spot that still ached from being hit by a<br/>hammer, Genma demanded, "Who are you, madam!"<p>Akane went and got the unruined pants from where she'd<br/>dropped them, "If it's really destiny, then it could<br/>not really be changed!"<p>Holding out her staff to keep everybody away from the<br/>sticks on the ground, Madam Attar told them, "The<br/>modern term for destiny is probability."<p>Genma told the old woman, "A true martial artist makes<br/>his own destiny. And by his own efforts changes the<br/>odds to... Is she going to tell us our fortune?" The<br/>tone of his voice had changed to one of interest.<p>Mr. Chorus nodded, "Yes! Madam Attar read people very<br/>good. She always more right than even Cologne."<p>Akane, having put the wrong leg in a pants leg, was<br/>now putting it in the right one, "What does a cheap<br/>perfume have to do with knowing about the future?"<p>Mr. Chorus said, "No, Perfume is not cheap woman.<br/>Madam Colo-"<p>Madam Attar ordered, "Quiet! I have to sort through<br/>this scrawl."<p>Akane asked, "Can't I just do it over?"<p>Genma said, "Ranma, that is not how the arcane arts<br/>work."<p>Akane told him, "My name is not RANMA!"<p>Madam Attar cried, "I have found him!"<p>Genma asked, "Who?"<p>Akane told him, "Ranma!" pulling up the pants. Then<br/>she said to Attar, "Your magic sticks failed! They<br/>don't recognize it's me inside his body!"<p>Madam Attar informed her as she stooped to pick up the<br/>"I Ching" sticks, "They have recognized his destiny is<br/>YOUR destiny. Both your cures can only be found in TRUE<br/>love!"<p>Akane was tying the pants on. "True...Come again?"<p>She aimed all of the sticks at Akane and Genma, "There<br/>is a serious imbalance in Yin! And that MUST be<br/>corrected!"<p>The wooden sticks hit shiatsu/pressure points that<br/>rendered the two temporarily immobile.<p>Mr. Chorus cried, "Madam Attar, what you do!"<p>She assured him, "I shall give you a shampoo, and you<br/>shall forget this ever happened."<p>She then brought out joss/incense sticks from her<br/>sleeves. "I am very sorry, child. That love must NOT<br/>be gentle or sweet." She started using the joss sticks<br/>as darts, sticking them in his (and Genma's)<br/>acupuncture points. "And as long as you have the body<br/>linked to accursed body, YOU are the one who has must<br/>fulfill Ranma's destiny." She then made a book of<br/>matches appear from her sleeves, "As he must fulfill<br/>your part in it."<p>She lit the joss sticks, starting the same moxibustion<br/>treatment Dr. Tofu had already given Ranma in Akane's<br/>body. "May the love your souls have for each other be<br/>strong enough to continue through your ordeals..." She<br/>stood over the body pin-cushioned with burning incense<br/>sticks, and prayed: " "May the Curse of Juusenkyo lead<br/>to a greater curse"."<p>Notes Below:<p>In this Alternative Ranma, the Musk are, at best, false<br/>claimants to Juusenkyo. It is the Amazons that are the<br/>Guardians of the accursed springs. Why? A greater<br/>curse? The Amazons are like those on the world we are<br/>familiar with. How pure do you think their motives are?
