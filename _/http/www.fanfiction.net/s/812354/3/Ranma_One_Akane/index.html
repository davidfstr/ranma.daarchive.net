</div><p>Ranma One-Akane</p><p>By Ron Dow75</p><p>4: Surfaces</p><p>Ranma's small, soft, singed,  scratched, and soaking wet Akane-body was taken to Furinkan High's main  building. She was cradled in the very strong arms of a man in a kendo-gi who  looked like he could be that Kuno-creep's much older brother.</p><p>All gave way before the samurai  who claimed to be their acting headmaster. Even dripping wet, he was imposing.  And that was from just a fraction of the battle aura Ranma sensed. All of the  rest was directed inward.</p><p>The clothes Ranma were in, too,  were singed, tattered and soaking wet. The man's lower left arm could feel  through the back of the blouse she had on; his right hand supported the bare  thighs the school dress revealed. {Is that what this 'acting headmaster' is  holdin' back! Is he a secret pervert that's afraid he'll lose it,  otherwise?}</p><p>He WAS overly stoic; all of the  time from the pool, he'd kept his eyes straight ahead, not looking down at her  body once.</p><p>They reached the infirmary just as  she got her wind back: "Please let me go," she said far more politely than she  wanted. {Damn! How come a BODY has things to say when the owner is outa it!  Does that have anything to do with why I THINK in _HER voice?}</p><p>A girl with her dark brown hair  tied up in a short ponytail by a red ribbon gave a surprised reaction,  "Akane?"</p><p>Ignoring the girl in his arms, the  man in charge told the girl below him, "Go to the office, and get a spare  uniform." He turned to Ranma only to ask, "What size?"</p><p>Apparently that information was  readily at hand for the Akane-girl. Ranma had to say, "I, I don't know."</p><p>The other girl said, "I know! I'll  get it, sir!" exiting.</p><p>The big man of brawn continued on.  Ranma asked, "Where are you, taking me?"</p><p>His answer was, "To bed."</p><p>Her answer was, "I don't want you  to take me to bed!" And she reared back her hand to slap him. {Martial arts  SLAPPING!} Ranma protested.</p><p>The force of her blow spun her as  she was thrown through the air.</p><p>She landed, clumsily and  awkwardly, on the bed. {Ow-ch, ch! Not only do these no-good boobs wanna get in  the way—So does a stickin'-out hip!}</p><p>But Ranma quickly pushed herself  up on one hip, ready to defend-and-attack.</p><p>What she saw was the back of the  expressionless adult Kuno as he placed an infirmary screen between them with  one hand. He departed without looking back, without saying another word.</p><p>Dr. Tofu Ono flipped the switch  that lit his cellar. Beyond the immediate area were the Plexiglas-door  bookcases that contained his eclectic library. Along with ancient Chinese  tombs, modern Western-style textbooks, paperback treatises, pamphlets and  brochures to such attractions as "The Three Brothers" and "Juusenkyo", he had a  special selection of mangas. He liked the original ideas they gave him for his  treatments. But there were a few shoujos.</p><p>In the immediate area, to his  left, was an empty bookstand. To his right were a couple of chairs, a reading  table and lamp near the wall. Across the way, its doors closed, a shrine was on  a table by the further wall. Next to that, in the corner was a desk-sized,  double-hatch (one with a heavy padlock) chest with pure white cloth covering  something about 60 centimeters high. And beside that was a map of the local  area tacked to a single wooden ornamental screen. The good doctor paused to  ponder before it. "I wonder how it got moved?" Carefully, he repositioned it a  couple of centimeters until it was between him and the correct degree of NNW  direction. "There!" he smiled.</p><p>On the map different  colored-painted Chinese ideograms and symbols marked various, seemingly random  locations. Dr. Tofu liked to think of them as "geo-chi shiatsu points". Only  one of them had a red-and-black yin-and-yang sign. And that one was NNW of the  clinic.</p><p>A girl moved the metal-frame-and-cloth-curtain  of the screen to look in on, "Akane! You actually met him?"</p><p>Ranma saw she had the smallest  eyes and lightest brown hair she remembered seeing in a fellow Japanese; "Who  is he? He claims to be the acting headmaster."</p><p>The girl came into the little  privacy area and immediately sat down on the bed with her, "That's who he is!  He's ALSO the biggest mystery of Furinkan!" {Gee, she's sittin' close, even for  a Japanese. Do all girls get next to each other like this?}</p><p>Ranma said, "The mystery is how a  guy like that became even an acting headmaster." {Her bein' up next to me like  this is pushin' my buttons to back off, assert myself…or grab her!}</p><p>The girl whose left hip and thigh  {to say nothing of the boob) were nearly touching Ranma's right told her,  "Yeah, he belongs in a samurai epic."</p><p>{…But it doesn't bother the  Akane-body. Girls must get this close to each other normally after all! Focus  on,} "A samurai epic?"</p><p>She said, "Yeah! Those scenes  where the warrior is off deep in the woods, undergoing tests of discipline?"</p><p>Though Ranma had seen very little  TV or theater because of his travels and his skinflint pop, even she knew about  the most famous of those scenes; "Are there any waterfalls around here?"</p><p>She shook her large head of hair,  "No. But that's why he keeps water in the swimming pool, unheated—Even in the  winter!"</p><p>Ranma said, "You mean, he's the  reason there was water in the pool when it's too cold to swim in?"</p><p>She nodded, "He doesn't swim in  it, I don't think. He just likes to be in it up to his chin."</p><p>Ranma said, "Oh!…That's why he was  there when –In his clothes?"</p><p>To the right of the wooden screen  with the map on it, nearest the stairs, was the bookstand. On it, Dr. Tofu had  placed a Chinese medical reference. Placing his hands on the chart of the human  acupuncture points, he let his left hand hover over the map. "Yes, the  disturbance remains at the Tendou property. Akane must still not show signs of  recovery. I'd hoped it was only temporary amnesia. No harm would come if her  mind had been prompted to reconnect with her familiar ways on waking up.  Hmm…but it seems the cause of her problem was not one of sickness.</p><p>"But there was something that was  causing my Diagnostic to sound the alarm yesterday. Sickness is normally what  it means; making sure those who lived or worked at the geo-chi points are  treated keep the disruptive effects of the sites sealed back. Sickness demons  are usually the first to emerge.</p><p>"But the Diagnostic was what  suggested the treatment I used on poor Akane. I would NOT have done anything to  make a person with a possible head injury unconscious, otherwise."</p><p>The doctor he slammed the book  closed, annoyed with himself, "If only the thought of seeing Kasumi hadn't  clouded my mind, I could've been alert to what was really happening."</p><p>He picked up the book from the  stand, and stood looking at his bookcases, "I'm going to need assistance in  finding the correct text I'll need."</p><p>Tucking the weighty book under an  arm, he had enough time to bow his neck as he slapped his palms together, "I  need you, Beti."</p><p>The thin, oddly plain girl talking  to Ranma asked, "I know you say you don't like gossip, Akane, but hasn't Nabiki  told you any of these things about Mr. Touno?"</p><p>Ranma asked, "Who?"</p><p>She said, "Who's Nabiki; your  sister?"</p><p>Ranma asked, "No: Who's Mr.  Touno?"</p><p>She said, "He's the acting  headmaster, Sadamu Touno-sama."</p><p>Ranma asked, "It's not Kuno?"</p><p>The girl laughed, "Can you imagine  a "Headmaster Kuno"? Let's keep things straight, he's Headmaster Touno."</p><p>Ranma said, "But he looks so much  like Kuno!"</p><p>The girl nodded, "The word is that  they're related. A cousin, I think."</p><p>Ranma looked away to what,  half-drowned at the time, she remembered, "So that's why Kuno called him itoko  no kata." She returned her look to the girl, "Okay, now, for you. What is your  name?"</p><p>Ranma received a very strange look  back, "I'm Tsugako. Nabiki's first vice president and secretary?"</p><p>Ranma returned the look, {What the  hell does that mean?}</p><p>From the other side of the screen  came, "I'm back with the spare school uniform and emergency unmentionables,  Akane!"</p><p>Tsugako said, "And that's Sayuri;  your best friend?"</p><p>While Beti did the research among  the bookcases, Dr. Tofu'd gone to the chest to uncover the special mass of marbled  red clay on a silver platter. Resting beside it was a case with ancient bronze  acupuncture needles.</p><p>Before beginning, Tofu sighed, "If  only the answers from one reading did not settle out so soon after."</p><p>Starting with the skills he  learned as a chiropractor, the doctor started running his strong fingers over  and beneath the surface of the clay. He felt for the spots that called to be  pushed, pulled or massaged; when he felt an energy imbalance, he would stick  one of the needles in it. That is when the clay would spasm and seem to come  alive…</p><p>The soggy uniform dress fell to  the floor around her bare feet.</p><p>The idea of getting out of girls'  clothes was a welcome one to Ranma. {Too bad I can't do the same for the body!  Life would be different for me, then.} But she knew it was only to put on a  dress that was just like the one she despised, only one not wet and messed up.  {Girls' gotta be all 'neat, and clean, and pre-tty'; can't have them look like  they really do anything.} Okay, Ranma knew she was being unfair; she'd seen  more than enough hard-working women in his travels. But she, the Stallion, had  a great big mental block on about all things positive about females. Until her  100% male-self got as used to being a girl as he was capable of getting, she  would not be ready to deal with her blindspot. {I can't even think about bein'  the one needin' rescuing right now," she glowered to herself.</p><p>{' Course, it's not like I haven't  had to be helped before. I remember stayin' at this Buddhist monastery after I  hurt myself once. They talked about the "Folds of Adjustment". Something about  two days, two weeks, two months, two—} She had gotten down to the wet  peach-colored bra and (somewhere below it) wet, lacey, taffeta panties.</p><p>{Even that long and I won't be  likin' any of this!}</p><p>"Akane?" Sayuri asked. She was  holding out a towel for her.</p><p>Ranma accepted it. {I don't want  to be a girl long enough to HAVE to learn if I can!}</p><p>Ranma started drying herself off.  She saved the underwear for last; besides being the wettest, they were also had  in them the parts that were the most…</p><p>Tsugako asked, "Aren't you going  to change into fresh lingerie, Akane?"</p><p>Ranma said, "Oh, right!" trying to  remember exactly what that word meant even as the body had reached around and  was getting slack in the middle of the peach-colored bra by pulling on the  elastic band… {What a bother! What is with girls puttin' on new things the  first chance they get! As a guy, I never had a problem with leavin 'damp  underwear on and lettin' them dry naturally</p><p>Tsugako commented, "What were you  thinking this morning, Akane? Your top and bottom don't match in the least."</p><p>While the bra was being dropped on  the chair with the other wet things, Ranma said, "It's not like anybody is  supposed to see them."</p><p>Sayuri said, "Where is your mind  today, Akane? Of course they're going to be seen."</p><p>That's when a crowd of voices  entered the infirmary.</p><p>Dr. Tofu made one last pass of his  hands over the work of clay-with-bronze-needles that could now, at best, be  called abstract. He read its lumpy surface as a phrenologist reads the head.  One last push, and he was satisfied that the true character of the present  situation was ready to be read.</p><p>But it wasn't from the swellings  in the misshapen mass he would read. The black-green lines within the red clay  (with specks of yellow) seemed to form very idiosyncratic sousho/cursive  ideograms.</p><p>"Hmm…"Three have become five…"  Okay, five doesn't have quite the primal power that three does; but all prime  numbers are stable. I don't see the disturbance. It is Yin and Yang that are in  constant change. They are two with two more hidden within them, making four.  The threat from the Tendou property is centered on even numbers. Three sisters  form a natural prime set. If that is the three referred to, Mr. Tendou would  still be able to compensate for the odds, by subtracting and adding his  presence.</p><p>"If he was aware of the imbalance.  Hmm…"</p><p>Surprisingly little of the clay  had clung to the doctor's hands; this he massaged into them as he pondered. "My  Diagnostic is sensitive to the fluctuations of energies in the area. It  wouldn't have rung like a figurative bell like it had if it hadn't been struck  by an impending disturbance." The clay disappeared as it was absorbed into his skin.  "I was attuned to its peal, and not distracted by anything yesterday. I looked  at the time. It happened at 8:25 AM. And since I found out later it had to do  with Akane…Whatever precipitated the disturbance happened then, at her school."</p><p>Tofu had a thought, "That could  mean that whatever the crisis is has effected the school as well!"</p><p>{It's okay…This body isn't  overreactin' as much as I wanna. It must be sorta okay for a buncha girls to  see another *Swallow* another girl naked; nude. Right: This is Japan.</p><p>{Maybe it makes some sense to let  a body that knows how to be a girl to take the lead for a while. If it was left  up to me alone I'd probably end up screwin' up royal, and becoming an even  bigger damned fool than I feel like right now.} Then she made a resolution, {As  long as I'm stuck bein' a full-time girl, not a half-time, or part-time girl,  I, I, -I can't even think it! I'm not ready, yet!}</p><p>"Akane! Akane Tendou! Is that  your answer!" asked one of the representatives from every classroom in the  school; there were so many, most were out in the hall. And they all wore the  same blue jumper and white, puffy-sleeve blouse uniforms. Ranma wasn't.</p><p>"My answer?" {While I was thinkin'  to myself, they must've asked something that that Akane-girl hadn't rehearsed  in her head before or something. It isn't in the body's programmin'.}</p><p>A girl shorter than Ranma was now,  with the big brown eyes that left little white showing stepped forward. She  wasn't kawai/cute, exactly. But she definitely wasn't Ranma's idea of what a  leader of a mob should look like (but there was still an alarm bell going off  in Ranma's mind that she was too sensory overloaded to deal with). "Since  asking you politely is not sufficient," ("With offerings!" another good said, holding  up a small gift wrapped parcel with both hands.) "We will ask you in blunt  language. We demand that you choose a guy!"</p><p>("But not Chika!"   "Or Hisa!"   "Inugoya is mine!")</p><p>Ranma finally found her voice,  "Why would I want to do a dumb thing like that?"</p><p>A tall girl with long but stiff  hair, with a more or less unfeminine manner about her {Now, that's my idea of a  girl who could lead a riot.} said, "Because all of the guys worth dating have  become obsessed with you, Akane! All they can talk about is you!"</p><p>Ranma said, "That's dumb of them."</p><p>The tall girl said, "We're talking  about boys." Of course they're dumb.</p><p>Off to the side, a permed girl  Akane's size but with what seemed like a much better figure said, " '  Especially considering what they seem to prefer." There was an insult in there,  punctuated by the survey she gave her.</p><p>That did not bother Ranma's  feeling, but it did bring her mind back to how naked she was; she told them, "I  don't want to choose any boys! I HATE boys!"</p><p>The brown-eyed girl said, "We've  heard that all before. But for the good of the group, the girls of Furinkan  High, you WILL date a boy."</p><p>The tall girl said, "Yeah! And be  so hopelessly gone on him, all the other boys will stop thinking of you and  think of us, for a change!"</p><p>Ranma told them more forcefully,  "The thought of acting like a silly girl is too…ridiculous…to even talk about!"  She was stopped from saying a word that would've certainly have had the girls  feeling more insulted than they already felt.</p><p>The race-queen type said, "Then  you leave us with no choice."</p><p>There were nods and other shows of  agreement from the gathered girls.</p><p>Ranma stopped feeling naked and  became merely nude as she adopted the usual battle stance; her spirit struggled  to become one with the body. "What are you going to do! I warn you, I'm a  martial artist!" {Wow! I actually got to say that!}</p><p>The tall girl smirked, "That won't  matter. Nothing you do can stop it."</p><p>The beauty gave Ranma her most  vixen smile, "The word is about to go around that, "despite your violent  protests", you have become the fiancée in an arranged marriage."</p><p>The girl still holding the gift  with both hands murmured, "We're sorry, Akane."</p><p>That news so stunned Ranma her  arms lowered themselves. "Fiancee? Marriage!" There was only one automatic  association the Akane-body had with those two words. "I don't want to have  anything to do with KUNO!" she yelled. {Why DOES her mouth say one thing, and  her crotch say another!}</p><p>Tofu went over to the bookstand  and the "Guide to Accursed Grounds, Third Edition" Beti had placed on it. There  were places that had a greater concentration of geo-chi points than Nerima,  some even had well over a hundred within an a hectare/couple of acres or so of  land. Juusenkyo was one that came to the doctor's mind for some reason. "I  wonder if my Diagnostic picked up a disturbance in one of those. It would still  have to relate back here, or I would not have heard the resonance." It was just  a hunch, but if anybody could sense things above this physical plane, it was  Beti. It was just too bad about her problem, or she could have been much more  of a help to the doctor. But, then, that was what led to her death, and how he,  eventually, came to have her skeleton. It was a very tragic story.</p><p>Tofu smiled, Beti had even brought  a photograph of Akane Tendou. Picking it up, he said, "Well, since I thought of  it, I'll start with Juusenkyo." Then he mused, "If you begin at the ends, what  you're looking for is usually found in the middle, anyway."</p><p>No sooner had he placed his hand  on the section, than the photograph changed. He only got a glance at it before  the face returned to that of Akane, but it was enough to give him the answer he  was after. "That's why the Diagnostic recommended the turtle-over-snake treatment!  It all makes perfect sense, now!</p><p>"The idea is NOT to make the boy  Akane; the idea, the heart of the problem is to make sure that that they are  kept SEPARATE! There must be TWO STRONG identities in that one body! If there  was just the boy's, then there'd be one less identity, that still housed in  Akane's body's. One minus five is FOUR! "Three" would "have become four". FOUR  is the number of Yin and Yang! It is vital there be an odd, preferably prime  number at the Tendous!</p><p>"I'm going to have to make Mr.  Tendou aware of the new—"</p><p>Dr. Tofu Ono had a realization  that made him pick up the "Guide" with both hands and stare at its picture of  bamboo poles over each of the geo-chi points. "Does that mean Akane's soul is  now one of the "Three" of the "Five" identities!"</p><p>Suddenly the temple bell-like gong  that someone who has not absorbed some of the clay could not hear from the  Diagnostic became loud enough to catch his attention.</p><p>Dr. Tofu snapped his head around,  "B, but, there ought to be balance now! The crisis should at least have been  dampened!"</p><p>He rushed back to the chest,  "Beti! We're going to have to operate on the Diagnostic! While there is still  time, we are going to get to the deeper mysteries behind Akane and this boy!  And may Destiny and the gods be kind."</p><p>Notes Below:</p><p>Ranma would have treated Akane's  body and identity the same way as he would've treated the Juusenkyo accursed  female identity. Which was what he was about to do; there was nothing to keep  Ranma from trying to go back immediately to China. It is important that until  the real Akane returns to the Tendou home her presence be felt in Nerima. After  that?</p><p>If Ranma hadn't been given the  turtle-over-snake treatment, Akane's-body identity would have been reduced to  zero(*)?  Okay, then what about the  Accursed (Female) form of Juusenkyo? The simple answer is the independence is  provided by the curse magic; it IS the accursed form. Part of assertion of that  independence is the "water magnet" effect.</p><p>(*) Not quite true, but correct for  the definitions the Diagnostic was conveying on its surface:</p><p>"Three" and "Five" are the simple  way of counting the identities. Subtract Akane's and Ranma's bodies and you do  not really come back to Three. The true number might be closer to "Twenty-two over  seven": A truly magic number.</p><p>They'll be more on that after I've  explored Akane's side of the equation in an "Akane Two-Ranma" chapter or two.  Remember, if Ranma's body doesn't have a strong identity, too, the equation  doesn't come out to five, either. Alert: An ancient character of mine (i.e.,  from my pre-computer days) is going to make an appearance that will put these  stories on a path different from accepted fanfic lore.</p><p>One final note: I like the stories  that are forming in my head with this "fiancee" story angle. It has great  potential. But I'm not happy with how the girls turned on Akane. (Hint.) It has  to do with the deeper mysteries of her and Ranma.</p>
