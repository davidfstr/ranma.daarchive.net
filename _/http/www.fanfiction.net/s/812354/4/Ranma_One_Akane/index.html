</div>Akane Two-Ranma<p>By Ron Dow75<p>01: To Be a Warrior at Last?<p>[This takes place before, on the more familiar<br/>timeline, Akane Tendou even knows Ranma and Genma<br/>Saotome even exists.]<p>Nude and wet, Akane had just gotten out of the<br/>furo/sunken bathtub in her family's Japanese-style<br/>bathroom. Even after the soak, she was still cursing<br/>herself for having let Kuno get a strike on her with<br/>his wooden bokken sword. The boys at school were her<br/>only real challenge as a martial artist. If<br/>Upperclassman Kuno had won, not only would her honor<br/>be at risk, but her reputation as a girl! He already<br/>had a warped view of the world. What would he say<br/>happened if he did a date from her! Even people<br/>THINKING she might kiss him-<p>"Ohrr!" She growled, and kicked the bar of soap that<br/>had strayed away from the shower area beside the<br/>furo. The force of her exasperation sent it bouncing<br/>off the blue tile walls.<p>Kasumi called out: "Akane! Will you clean the tub<br/>after you're done? Dr. Tofu says his herbal<br/>ointment leaves a ring!"<p>Annoyed, now, at having to be distracted from her<br/>annoyance, Akane answered, "Okay!" turning to do the<br/>chore. Her foot landed on the soap that had slid<br/>back to her.<p>The girl with her hair tied up found herself falling<br/>towards the tub: She screamed!<p>Meanwhile, in Juusenkyo, a panda leaped from the pole it<br/>had landed on, and attacked a ponytail teen in a<br/>gi/martial artist's uniform while he was distracted<br/>talking to their Chinese Guide. The brunette boy was<br/>struck, and falling towards one of the springs: He<br/>screamed!<p>Splash!<p>In the suddenly cold water, Akane felt something<br/>unbelievable being linked to something even more<br/>unbelievable! It was almost a relief when the<br/>second replaced the first.<p>But then her fear of drowning, her fear of water<br/>began to set in: The girl with hair tied in a short<br/>ponytail found the bottom, and rose in a pond that<br/>was above the waist deep. Something told her it<br/>should've been below the waist<p>There was something different about her body. First<br/>of all she was tenser-and getting tenser-than she'd<br/>felt even before, every smaller muscle tightening.<br/>Second she was no longer nude; on her was the<br/>familiar feeling of a kempo-gi coat and pants<br/>(though she'd never worn one this wet). And third,<br/>and perhaps most attention grabbing were the greater<br/>curves she felt from larger top to lighter bottom!<p>Confused, Akane opened up the front of the soiled,<br/>white gi, and looked at her now size D boobs.<p>"AAAAAA!" her now different voice screamed.<p>Somebody had been talking: "...Now whoever fall spring<br/>take body of young girl (ha, ha)."<p>Her shocked mind finally told her it was a man<br/>talking: Akane quickly pulled the wide-open top<br/>closed. Tight! {Aw-ch, moved too fast.}<p>Her new face scowling, her blush caught up with her.<br/>She wanted to turn away, retreat until she could get<br/>her bearings. {It's always an advantage to know as<br/>many of the 5 Answers as you can before you fight.}<br/>But she had no answers. {I don't know this man-I<br/>don't even know how I GOT here!} Her fists up<br/>against the larger bust she felt {Or LIKE this!},<br/>she had to stare up at him, read his moves, and<br/>prepare herself as much as she could for an attack.<br/>That increased her already immense tension. It also<br/>screamed that this wasn't her body! {Even the voice<br/>I think with isn't mine!}<p>The wide man in brown Mao clothes and yellow-star<br/>cap said in accented Japanese, "Oo, do not look at<br/>me like that, Miss-I mean sir!" And he pointed to<br/>the Chinese ideographs on the long, ringed placard<br/>book he was holding, "I not do this. Is "Spring of<br/>Drowned Girl"! Nan-niichuan! I repeat: There very<br/>tragic legend of girl who drown in spring, one<br/>thousand five hundred year ago. Now whoever fall in<br/>spring take body of young girl."<p>Akane raised her higher voice, "That DOESN'T explain<br/>how I-"<p>Just as she was beginning to deal with two (three?)<br/>uncertainties at once, a huge black-and-white furry<br/>creature landed on ground near the Chinese man. It<br/>tried to stay erect on its hind legs {WHY is it<br/>wearing a white gi coat and, and...Eastern-<br/>style/loops-instead-of-earpieces glasses around one<br/>ear?}, but fell over onto its fore ones, too.<p>It lost the fight, and fell onto its jowls, with<br/>only its rump up.<p>Akane cried, "EE! What IS that?"<p>The Chinese-looking man said, "I repeat that, too?<br/>That, sir, is your father. He fall..."<p>Akane started wading towards the pool's edge,<br/>"Dad! He's here, too!" {If this weirdness can<br/>happen to me, why couldn't it happen to somebody<br/>else in our house?}<p>The Chinese man flipped over to another placard in<br/>the ringed book, "...into Xiong-mao-nicuan, "Spring of<br/>Drowned Panda"! Very tragic story of panda who drown<br/>two thousand year ago. The legend say whoever fall<br/>in spring take body of panda!"<p>Akane had enough! Freeing her fists from their hold<br/>on the kempo-gi's lapels to get a grip on her<br/>sanity, she yelled, "That's ridiculous! People do<br/>not turn into other things!"<p>The Chinese man blinked. "But you are girl now(?) I<br/>see you peep!"<p>She took a swipe at the idiot, "Of course I'm a<br/>girl!" {Can't you see these caricatures of<br/>breasts!} She reached out and took hold of one of<br/>the FOUR {WHY would I think that number was<br/>important-I'm in a situation, here!} bamboo poles in<br/>the water to steady herself.<p>The Chinese man said, "Oo, I not hear Nan-niichuan<br/>change personality, too, like Fuushan-niichuan,<br/>"Spring of Drowned Priest"." Just speaking of it,<br/>had him flip over to that placard. "I need read<br/>again "Guide to Accursed Grounds, Annotated<br/>Edition"."<p>The panda was nodding as if it understood what the<br/>man was saying as it walked up beside him.<p>Akane's foot slid on the muck on the bottom of the<br/>pond. She grabbed a pole in time. Feeling the<br/>heavier swing of those boobs, she looked down; she<br/>saw her reflection for the first time. "Who is<br/>this!" Those too blue eyes, that too red hair,<br/>that too cute face, that too, too built, petit body:<br/>{THESE aren't mine!}<p>The Chinese man smiled, "That is tragic reaction I<br/>expect." He flipped to, "You fall in "Spring of<br/>Drowned Young Girl", Nan-niichuan. There very tragic<br/>legend..."<p>Akane had to quickly back away from slashing claws,<br/>"Dad! What do you think you're DOING!" He foot<br/>slipped! If she hadn't been grasping the pole, she<br/>would've gone under-Maybe drowned!<p>"DAD!" she screamed, looking for the chance to pull<br/>him in {' Easier thought of than done, when I ache<br/>like this}. If he wouldn't help her out {He KNOWS<br/>how much I hate ponds and pools and the like!},<br/>she'd climb on him and help herself out!<p>Got it! "Now, to flip-"<p>The Chinese man cried, "Eww, no, sirs! Very bad you<br/>fall into TWO accursed ponds when in accursed-form!"<p>This time the panda listened to him. As it brought<br/>its foreleg back, the newly made redhead came with<br/>it as she determinedly clung on. Her gi pants were<br/>water logged and dripping.<p>The Chinese man flipped through his book of<br/>placards, "Most tragic example...Oo, I do not have one<br/>for "Yeti-Riding-Bull-Holding Crane-with-Eel". Name<br/>must be too long. Chinese name is too long, also, to<br/>tell to people who do not know language, anyway."<p>Lowering the book, he told them, "You fall into Nan-<br/>niichuan you become young girl...panda!"<p>The creature dropped, and ran as fast, and<br/>awkwardly, as its four legs could carry it.<p>Having let go, Akane yelled, "DAD!" as she now<br/>struggled to keep from rolling {Ow, larger boobs at<br/>least make better stop-wedges.} into yet another<br/>pond. Cramp! Cramp! {Come on! You've dealt with<br/>cramps before!...} Just not all over her body.<p>= = =<br/>The Chinese man, hesitantly, approached, "I help.<br/>You not make splash?"<p>Akane had more than one reason to yell, "Go near<br/>that water! Of course not!"<p>He reached down and pulled her by her exposed feet<br/>and ankles away from the pond's edge. He repeated to<br/>himself that this wasn't really a beautiful young<br/>girl; this had been a teenage boy just a few minutes<br/>ago, named Ranma. As 'sir' was dragged further from<br/>the water, the incredible, competing tensions eased<br/>enough for him to notice. To help him take his mind<br/>off of her softening body, he returned to his<br/>favorite topic, "Juusenkyo is one of many accursed<br/>grounds around world. They first become training<br/>ground when warrior come, meet challenge of<br/>different body. After he master old, he master new.<br/>Then he is true master warrior."<p>On the damp earth and grass, Akane thought, {Am, am<br/>I here to be a warrior?} She didn't understand how<br/>she came to be chosen {I haven't mastered my OWN<br/>body, yet}; but she DID understand the concept. A<br/>warrior-especially a martial artist needed to be in<br/>harmony with their body, thought and action wed as<br/>one. Right now she had TWO different sets of<br/>reflexes and habits fighting each other. One was<br/>that which came with her new body. Without them, she<br/>would be like a fish out of water, since her the new<br/>body responded differently than her old one. The<br/>other was that which she used to control her OWN<br/>body. All that was left of her old body was what her<br/>mind held onto. It was like a ghost to her. The<br/>faster she could learn to adapt her mind to a body<br/>she wasn't used to, the more ready her mind would be<br/>able to adapt to other problems: Like injuries,<br/>fatigue, temperature, hydration...even, perhaps,<br/>magic!<p>Akane struggled to prove her merit by pushing<br/>herself up off the ground on shaky arms. The more<br/>weight they had to support, the more they trembled.<p>The Chinese man offered his hand, "In days of lore,<br/>warrior fight warrior in great contest of cunning.<br/>They try keep each other from hot water. You have<br/>twelve hour find hot water, or have accursed-<br/>body...forever."<p>Akane heard that: "Half-a-day, or, or..." She looked<br/>off in the direction the panda she thought was her<br/>dad had run.<p>The Chinese man nodded, "Panda. It not change back."<p>At the thought of the danger her father was in,<br/>Akane forgot about herself. Before she knew it, she<br/>was up on her new feet.<p>The Chinese man said, "Sir! You are fast learner!<br/>Come, we get hot water at guest cabin."<p>Akane shook her head, as she began to limp away on<br/>smaller legs and feet {and narrower waist}; "I have<br/>to find Dad while I still can! And this body is<br/>going to slow me down too much as it is."<p>The man tried to explain, "But, sir! When you get<br/>your own body back, you track faster."<p>He was right of course. But that would be the easy<br/>way. That was not the way of this place. "I was<br/>brought here, to become somebody truly worthy of the<br/>name, warrior. That is what I've wanted all of my<br/>life." Then a catch developed in her new throat.<br/>"It's what I HAVE to be. It's my sacred filial duty.<br/>My obligation...my debt of honor." She then sounded<br/>like she was fighting back deeper emotions that had<br/>been released. "I was born to be a martial artist,<br/>and that is how I must die."<p>The Chinese man said, "Oo, sir is serious. I not<br/>argue with someone who think like that. I go get hot<br/>water ready."<p>Akane nodded as she heard him leave. He called her<br/>"sir", and that was how she felt. When a MAN<br/>honestly called a woman that {As opposed to a girl<br/>friend} it was a sign that she was recognized for<br/>something that was outside her gender. {' Not that<br/>women couldn't do most of the things guys could.}<br/>Then her cute face got Akane's more familiar frown,<br/>{...If guys would let them. Women's Liberation is<br/>something that's never really taken hold in the<br/>East.}<p>Trying to close her stiff fingers into a fist ended<br/>up only having them look like claws. "Sometimes, I<br/>wish I were a guy. I certainly wouldn't have to<br/>fight off girls like I have to guys." {Can you<br/>honestly imagine a group of girls fighting over a<br/>guy!} Then she had a second thought, {Well, may be<br/>a singer-idol. But NOT a guy whose only thing he's<br/>has going for him is he's rich and handsome. Just<br/>look at Kuno.} Just the thought of his name, and her<br/>old reactions wanted to imprint themselves on her<br/>new, smaller, tighter, hotter, wetter...<p>The twitching caused a taut leg to twitch, and skip<br/>again, sending her foot towards the brink of one of<br/>those springs. She bent down to physically restrain<br/>it-only to get a backache! She made the back arch,<br/>and she waddled on. {Kuno and his SAMURAI, grand-<br/>standing stunt!} she cursed! {It's because of HIM I<br/>started having feels like this!} Her mood had<br/>darkened even more, "I honestly think the reason<br/>I've been challenged to all those fights this<br/>semester is because the boys can't take ME<br/>seriously. No matter how many times I win, they<br/>refuse to accept they could lose to a...mere," the<br/>word 'mere' had a acrid taste, "girl."<p>{...And THIS "cute little thing" of a body is even<br/>more of a girl! *I can't even take it seriously.<p>{But that must be the whole point why I was given<br/>this ego-diminishing form!} she told herself as a<br/>way to fend off the attack on her pride from BOTH<br/>sides, the part of her that wanted to be a respected<br/>martial contestant, and the part that wanted to be a<br/>desired marital prize. {If I can overcome this<br/>handicap, then I can overcome just about anything!}<br/>And when she got back to Nerima, she'd show<br/>everybody that her own Akane-body was more than a<br/>match as a girl for this Cupy Doll's, too...<p>= = =<br/>In HIS rush to keep from falling in a spring that<br/>would make him female as well, the panda had<br/>actually stumbled along a path that took it by three<br/>other springs. "Honestly! If Dad had just kept his<br/>head, he could have avoided nearly all of them. We<br/>were on the edge of the springs area, after all."<p>Relieved that she had passed the last of them, Akane<br/>took one last wary look at that one. What if some<br/>animal or insect fell into it, and suddenly rose up<br/>out of it to attack her? Her mind found a very<br/>strange thought to ease her fear, {If you can become<br/>a combination of things with the water of more than<br/>one of them, then you could become something half-<br/>human and half-animal.<p>{But where ARE they? I haven't heard of<br/>anthropomorphic creatures running loose.} She shook<br/>her head to rid herself of the wild thought. {I wish<br/>I'd never listened to the Anime Club going on about<br/>American cartoons.}<p>She headed off towards woods at the base of the<br/>mountains ahead, trying not to think of a Disney<br/>dimension, a Warner Brothers dimension, a Hanna-<br/>Barbera dimension, a...<p>{If Pluto is a dog, then what is Goofy?...}<p>= = =<br/>Akane veered to the left. "There seems to be a spot<br/>up there with a lot of bamboo. That is what pandas<br/>eat, isn't it?" She shuddered at the thought of her<br/>dad having to live off of that. "It took Kasumi's<br/>best efforts to get him to eat what he did eat! If I<br/>remember right, bamboo can barely give a panda<br/>enough nutrition."<p>"Bwaoo!"<p>Akane looked to her right in time to see the black-<br/>and-white creature lumbering towards her upright. "-<br/>At least this one looks well-fed.<p>"Dad! Stop playing around, you've got to-" The<br/>panda wasn't slowing down!<p>Feeling like a deer caught in the headlights, Akane-<br/>broke free and acted!<p>She tipped herself over onto the ground at her side,<br/>and let the clumsier beast run past her.<p>The panda had to fall down onto its front paws to<br/>stop a few feet beyond her. It then turned, and<br/>charged at her again.<p>Akane was still on her slimmer back on the ground<br/>looking at more than 150 kilograms of beast coming<br/>for her. "Dad, is, is this your way of trying to<br/>help me?" Suddenly, she remembered again why she<br/>thought they were here. She wanted to make him proud<br/>of her. "Yes: I will become a warrior among<br/>warriors!"<p>The monster leaped. "I won't let you down!" She<br/>brought her new shorter legs up at almost the right<br/>spot under the thick coat of fur. Grunting with all<br/>of the body's might, she used its own enormous<br/>weight against it. "You-Or Mom!" Feeling like she<br/>had added the strength of another women to the two<br/>she already had, she tossed her father's figure<br/>meters away.<p>His panda form landed on skidded its side, almost<br/>rolling over onto its other side.<p>Panting from the effort, and feeling sore but good,<br/>Akane stared at her challenger, calculating its<br/>battle plan. {Dad should continue attacking me until<br/>one of us can no longer move. He owes it to me for<br/>neglecting my training!}<p>She channeled her own will through the reflexes of<br/>the body she was in. It was still like a child<br/>learning to do something new with her body, but at<br/>least she was no longer constantly fighting with it.<br/>She stood up, as erect as her aching muscles would<br/>allow. "Come on, Dad. We have twelve hours to make<br/>up for ten years."<p>There was surprising little anger in her.<p>= = =<br/>In a blood-red sunset, a red-ponytailed girl,<br/>bruised, scratched, and exhausted rode belly down on<br/>the back of her panda. Her dirty kempo-gi was in<br/>shreds. "We...still...have...a few...more...hours,"<br/>she wearily said into its fur.<p>"Beh-rah," it said, not sounding pleased.<p>Finally the Chinese guide's soft voice could be<br/>heard, "Sirs! Sirs, over here!" The wide man in<br/>brown was standing outside a one-room cabin built in<br/>the Chinese manner. There was a campfire pit off to<br/>the side of the dirt path to its one, now open,<br/>door. A bright fire and large plume of smoke acted<br/>as signals.<p>The only man in sight said, "I have teakettle<br/>ready!" holding it up as a greeting.<p>= = =<br/>As soon as the panda had reached the front of the<br/>cabin, it rose onto its hind feet, letting the girl-<br/>form tumble off of its hairy back into the grass<br/>with dirt patches.<p>"Owch-ch!" she groaned. "You're just mad because it<br/>was a draw..." She was too fatigued to do anything<br/>but lay where she'd fallen. She mumbled, "I fought a<br/>wild animal to a stand-still...," as she closed her<br/>eyes again.<p>"Bwah vra rraa," was its only comment as it took the<br/>teakettle from the guide.<p>The guide demonstrated, "Pour over head, shoulders,<br/>chest: Above heart. Hot water make you man again."<p>It asked, "Br-hot-d?" But deciding to be brave about<br/>it, it let a trickle come out of the kettle's spout<br/>onto its furry head.<p>The extra mass melted off of him. Underneath was a<br/>stout, muscular, hairless, and nude man. But at<br/>least he had his glasses on. He adjusted the straps<br/>around his ears as he looked down on the person<br/>cursed to be a girl. "You disappoint your father,<br/>boy! You've allowed a girl's body to make you forget<br/>everything I've taught you!"<p>And with that, he took the lid off of the teakettle,<br/>and tossed the contents at the soft body lying at<br/>his feet. "You're not ready to be called a man."<p>"AAAA! That's HOT!" cried a tenor voice.<p>Notes Below:<p>In the movie "Freaky Friday", the mind transfer<br/>happened just as the mom took a drag on her<br/>cigarette (HOT), and the daughter took a mouthful of<br/>ice cream (COLD).<p>I think having to deal with the ghost of your old<br/>body (just as an amputee has to) is what would most<br/>likely happen if you could change bodies. And,<br/>unlike other body-changing stories, it fit in with<br/>the plot of this story.<p>I chose to interpret Pantyhose Tarou's curse having<br/>started with a man who fell into four springs and<br/>then had drowned his accursed form(s) in another<br/>because: (a) It's the simplest explanation. (b) It<br/>allows for more story options! Especially when (c)<br/>matched up against what happens when somebody has<br/>their uncursed form cursed again. That is for the<br/>next chapter.
