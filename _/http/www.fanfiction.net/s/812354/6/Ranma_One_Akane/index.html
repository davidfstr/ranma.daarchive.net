</div>Akane Two-Ranma  By Ron Dow75<p>03: 101<p>Akane Tendou dreamed. She dreamed of falling into her bathtub at home in Japan and coming up in a spring in the wilds of China. Only it wasn't HER body she'd come up in. It was a petit redhead with a size D bust! It was all part of her test to become a true warrior: If she could make a warrior out of that cute thing, she would prove herself worthy of greater challenges.<p>Or was there another reason she had ended up in Juusenkyo? Had it all been an accident? She talked in her sleep, "No! I have a destiny.I am going to be a warrior. My name will be  will have to repeat Akan-"<p>Zznap! Zpop! Zzack! -her name was cut off before the vocal cords could say it. Why! All she could grab onto was, "Shampoo 101". And an old woman's voice saying, "And to insure that it will keep its hold, one must not forget the conditioner!"<p>Outside of her dream, the solid, ponytail male body she was in did not feel like tossing and turning. An old woman in a red silk robe with a black dragon writhing over had used the body as an altar. Akane still clearly remembered lying face up wearing only an open kempo-gi coat, and the Chinese woman sticking incense sticks into the guy's body. When she'd lit them, she muttered something about a "curse"; she then told Akane, "The destiny of both you and Ranma is at stake! Whether that is good or bad, I do not know yet. I do know this: Destiny does have crossroads, and what can change the path taken is free will. Your ability to go beyond what karma has programmed for you comes from your soul. Therefore, I must weaken your power to choose!<p>"This moxibustion/herb-burning treatment does not weaken your body, but weakens the influence you, Akane Tendou, can have over the destiny that rightfully belongs to Ranma. Karma has given this body and life for him. This body carries most of what the boy has learned throughout that life. This identity of his is what must be allowed to operate."<p>The small woman stepped within Akane's glazed eyesight. "The body does not have a soul. It responds to stimuli. When it does not have a strong suggestion on how to act in pre-determined way, OR when it is confronted with a true choice, then the soul within it can direct the body."<p>She then leaned her very stern face over Akane-in-Ranma. "It is your duty as one destined to be the helpmate of Ranma to consider what he would want, and have his body act accordingly."<p>Akane began to struggle and squirm against the acupressure technique that had paralyzed her. Hearing that she was expected to be the "good little female" and defer to the "the better sex" was too much for her to lie there and take.<p>The old woman shook her head. "I wish I could have you believing you WERE Ranma. But that would risk your connection to your old life and its destiny. Hypnotism would be the less violent answer. But first, as the saying goes, "How can one be expected to be like Xuan Zang if one is does not know who he is?" Perhaps when you come to know Ranma and hold his identity in some regard.."<p>She reached into one of her long flaring sleeves. "As for which identity will have sway over the accursed body, a young human girl, I believe-"<p>Suddenly Akane became fully awake: "Hey! That's cold!" she cried, rising from the straw on the dirt floor and kicking at the blanket that surrounded her small body. She actually found the bouncing about of too large boobs welcoming. For a moment. And her pedaling legs found nothing any girl wouldn't find between her legs. It just wasn't hers. Like the too large boobs. {Okay, it's not my body: But it is a girl's body, not that guy's. So why are the creeps I feel moving around from the back and around to the boobs, buns and sex!}<p>A man's voice barked, "Ranma! You'd rather be a girl! Well, let this is your first lesson!" And the man who claimed to be the boy's father yanked the blanket out from under and over her. He also took something else from her.<p>Akane was spilled out onto the floor-without any pants! She quickly tumbled over onto one shin, the other knees up. It did not even try to cover her privates. On top of that, the body wouldn't hold the opening of Ranma's oversized gi coat closed. The small hands, instead, were raised in fists. She screamed, "What'd you do that for!"<p>The martial artist she'd first met as a man when he was naked told her, "As a girl you'd better learn to go without pants, boy!" There was something very shiny about his head that caught Akane's glare, {Do bald men shampoo?}<p>Shaking THAT thought {Shampoo 110} from the head, Akane yelled at him, "Fine! But give me a sskirt! -And, p, panties! What kinda gir-l do you think I am!" Her stomach clenched. {Why is it hard to say skirt and panties?}<p>The man got a gleam in his eye before he went into a weeping act, "My son! That I would ever hear such words come out of your mouth!"<p>Akane yelled, "Stupid old man! This ain't MY mouth!" {What's happened to my language?}<p>The man in the kempo-gi/martial arts uniform, "No, that is NOT the mouth of my son! That is a mouth better suited for lipstick!"<p>Akane told him, "I don't use lipstick often! But when I do, it's usually a matte!" The clench became a fist in her belly.<p>The man bellowed, "Ranma, now I know you're mocking your father!"<p>Akane's light body leaped back from the gale-rising blow just in time.<p>But no sooner had she touched down on the balls on her new bare feet {Stop paying attention to the way the breasts move under the coat!}, her small body sprang back at the large man. "This is all YOUR fault, Old Man!" {It is? It certainly seems a natural thing to say.}<p>The "old man" lashed out as he dodged out of the way. {At least he wasn't thinking of the peep show he could've had!} But, while Akane felt mortified inside, the redhead's body lacked any sense of modesty {Only of repugnance.} as it ducked, and somersaulted feet-over-head until they struck the whitewashed walls of the Chinese cabin. Bending the knees until her bare thighs touched the back of the gi coat, the body exploded off the solid adobe-and-wood wall. {The draft! I wish I had shirt on.} That HAD to be the guy's reaction.<p>It had all been done so quickly, the more muscle-bound man was just turning to meet her attack. Akane felt impact against his padded belly. The body transferred all of her momentum into adult and landed, coiled, and ready for his next move.<p>The Chinese guide entered the cabin in time to yell, "Not the water!"<p>Genma Saotome slammed up against a stack of metal cans against the back wall. K-dong! K-dang! K-deng! Sploosh!<p>Yet another man was seeing her bottomless girl-body, now! Akane joined with the body to demand, "What'd you do with my pants!"<p>The panda answered, "Barao bwera!"<p>Mr. Chorus dropped the firewood he'd brought in and rushed over cans that lay cracked open on and about the panda. He was yelling about as loudly as he could in his naturally quiet voice, "Sirs! This water is all we have! Water is brought in from outside Valley of Juusenkyo!"<p>As the panda picked up one of the ruined containers, Akane saw that there was less than a week's worth of drinking water; there would be no baths. The body she was in strode up to the larger creature, and tried to lift it up by its chest hairs, "What'd you do with my pants, Pop!"<p>Angry, Akane thought, {Honestly! Didn't this Ranma have enough sense to just search for where the man had hidden them!}<p>The black-and-white beast just turned its muzzle away in an act of disdain. Akane could feel the body's emotional reaction, "I SAID where's my pants!" The body actually tried to shake the heavier animal. {No, it DOESN'T look like this Ranma had any sense!}<p>But the body's small fists did manage to pull at the fur hairs {Transfer more support to the buns!}. "Berrao!" the panda protested, bringing its clawed paws down for the redhead's head.<p>The 52-minus kilogram/115-minus pound body turned, grabbed hold of the front leg and flipped the 140-plus kilogram/300-plus pound beast a couple of meters/yards away.<p>Akane thought, {Wow! Despite the handicaps Ranma's identity is placing on the girl's body by refusing to accept her, it knows how to fight!} Then she wondered, {This isn't Ranma's guy-body. Why do I think HIS body is the one that's telling the girl's what to do?}<p>Looking at her right hand, Akane saw the answer. On its ring finger was the gold ring Madam Attar had placed on Ranma's guy-body. On it was embossed an oval that a creature's snake body made with its rooster's head and tail bent within. The Chinese witch had said, "This will unite the two bodies, by-passing most of your own will."<p>Akane wanted to take it off immediately, so that she could claim ONE body as her own.<p>But she was hit by a wooden sign that the panda had thrown.<p>Mr. Chorus said, "Oo, panda learn how to take things from sign space," and he pulled out one of his ringed placard books. On that sign were the Chinese characters for-<p>Rubbing the injured face, Akane yelled, "It's 'sign space', alright! There's nothing written on it!" The space for a message WAS blank.<p>The Chinese guide scratched his Mao cap with the yellow star, "Panda maybe can think of nothing?"<p>A claw of the panda showed the red under one lower eyelid and stuck out its tongue. "Biii!"<p>Akane said, "Oh, I think it has something to say!" The body was even more certain: It cocked a fist and charged.<p>The animal turned and ran out the open door on its four feet.<p>The body was yelling at it, "You think this is a game, Stupid Old Man! I'll show you games!" While Akane's mind was yelling, {Idiot! Don't go running outside without a bottom!}<p>= = =<p>Akane saw that the panda had veered off the path and was headed for one of the mountains that looked like the teeth of a gigantic carnivore. "You can't hide from me, Pop! This time, you're gonna get what you deserve!" {How many times has this Ranma said this! If it's imbedded into his standard list of responses, I don't think "Pop" has really EVER gotten what he deserved. Talk about useless!}<p>The body ran into the trees around the base of the hard limestone peak. She followed the trail and sounds the panda made as best it could. But lost it when it apparently had doubled back somewhere. {Now, are you ready to give up and get dressed!} Akane mind ineffectively yelled at the girl-body made stupid by the ring that connected her to the guy's.<p>It was a foolish idea. Akane could feel the anger that wouldn't leave. In that moment when the body was searching for a buried impulse that would tell it what to next, Akane asserted herself. It was still unwilling to give up, (How stubborn was this Ranma!} So she told it, "At least take the ring off!"<p>The hand rose to take those eyes further away from the very jutting breasts. Her tongue between her lips {Stop being cute!}, the girl's fingers tugged at the ring, and tried to twist it off, and retreated and yanked. While the body was doing this, her eyes began to wonder even more away from the curves. The only thing new to look at . Feeling how that the ring would not come off the way she was doing it, the body took an interest in something else: (I don't WANTA climb a mountain! Is THIS what Ranma did when he got frustrated!}<p>Her only answer was the girl-body lifting her foot as it reached for the to find its first handholds.<p>= = =<p>Akane Tendou was afraid of water she could drown in, and horror-show weird (Just the sound of eerie music can make my flesh crawl when I HAD my own flesh!} But heights weren't one of her fears.<p>The body allowed her to turn the head and look down 10 meters/yards. And up, it was about 10 more. The mountains about didn't seem that high only because Juusenkyo was a mountain valley within them.<p>Akane wasn't frightened, but that didn't mean this wasn't dangerous. Forget the fact that Ranma the martial artist had enough command of his blood flow that his body was restricting the amount this body's most girlish parts. There was something wrong with the way the body was climbing! He seemed to have almost no awareness that a girl lacked the upper body strength of a guy! The Ranma-body was insisting on attacking the steep rock face by pulling itself up. Saving her breath in the thin mountain air, she cried in mind, {Guys! Their answer to everything that's not sex has to involve their arms and pectorals! I wish I could tell him the news that this ISN'T how you treat a girl's body!}<p>It didn't even get the message when the girl's large boobs kept getting in the way! "Hey! It hurts bumpin' them up against the outcroppings!"<p>They came to a ledge that jutted out enough that the girl-body had to go around it or pull itself under it to reach the top. {I was right! The idiot! Ranma COULDN'T just take the easy way!} It would have been easy if this were his guy-body. But this was the redhead's body. Akane felt the slender arm muscles of a young girl working again at exercises they were not used to, muscles that reached, at last, the ledge and wanted nothing more than to relax for a while.<p>But it couldn't, because those blasted oversized boobs were in the way. The Ranma-part of the girl's body wanted to ignore the hurt and just drag the only pliant mammary organs across the edge and move onwards.<p>Akane had been struggling mightily to make the body to be more cautious, or, at least, slow down: All to no effect! The Ranma-trained body did what it wanted to do. But SHE, too, was a martial artist: If one technique didn't work, try another! {Easier said than done,} thought the girl getting special coaching JUST to learn to review different options.<p>Within her mind was still the body image of Akane Tendou, brunet Japanese girl of the Anything-Goes School! Yesterday, during her battle with the panda, that image had started to learn to cooperate with the other girl's body. That body, because of the rooster-snake ring, was now directed by the Ranma-body. But it still had the basic reflexes and habits of the original girl-or the body would be like a fish out of water. The body of one person is basically unsuited to operate another's, they are each too different. And a girl's was MORE different, still, from a guy's!<p>That was her opening! Akane focused the frustration in her soul energy into the outlets available. On the level of the muscles and tendons, they were better than a normal girl's, perhaps; but they were still shorter and weaker, less toned and tuned than those of Akane's body-image. But they WERE closer to hers than Ranma's. His identity had the constant impulse to reject the girly, sissy body. {Oh-rrr! He actually makes me FEEL slimy about being a girl!} This was the opening Akane needed to assert some of her own impulses.<p>It was still the girl-body that moved the legs, not Akane's body image, but the legs did do what they needed to do! The girl-thigh muscles were stronger than the guy's. The legs straddled the rocky outcropping and scooted the D-cups out and around the edge and onto the top of the ledge without any more scrapes and bruises.<p>Thereafter the body hurried up the 10 meters/yards to the pinnacle. The lower half of the girl-body was more under the control of its own reflexes. Muscles cramped, and spasmed at times in conflict with Akane. But Akane could back away here. She had to bite her metaphoric lip and let Ranma's identity dominate the redhead's upper body. (His identity is proud about this. That must be why he's letting the blood return to the breasts!}<p>When they reached the summit, all of the redhead's body, guy-led-top and girl-led-bottom, was fatigued from the effort. And Akane could no longer maintain the conversion of her soul force into energy. Besides not having had extensive training in using her ki in typical martial arts situations, having to fight the primal energy of somebody else's body while mediating with chi of yet another body that was not her own was just too wearing on her.<p>Panting and sweating, Akane and the girl-body stood there bent over, using the knees to help hold her up. Her eyes wandered over the skin that gi-coat did not cover, front and legs. It had many bruises, scraps and cuts. She almost smiled. "Not a pretty sight."<p>One good thing seemed to have come from the strenuous activity. The anger that had filled both her and Ranma's identity before had lessened to a simmer. She and the body started stretching out the sore, tight muscles.<p>That's when her eyes fell on the panda.<p>The black-and-white beast was leaning against a tree on the edge of a bamboo grove. It wasn't just taking it easy, it was laughing at a manga magazine!<p>She screamed, "How'd YOU, a panda, get up here before me!"<p>The animal looked up from its reading as if noticing her for the first time. Akane and the body stomped a bare, damaged foot, "Well!"<p>'Innocently', it pointed over to a green sign with an arrow beside a dirt path. The larger characters were Chinese ideographs. But underneath it, in Western letters was, [Juusenkyo].<p>That was too much, even for Akane, "Why you.! How long'd you know about that!"<p>The panda took out something from the thick magazine it'd been using as a bookmark. It was a brochure.<p>Akane could guess that it had a map. "You couldn'ta told me! I coulda fallen, you know!" And she charged at the unthinking beast!<p>= = =<p>The Ranma-led body clambered up peaks, and bounced down peaks, stumbling, tripping, rolling or tumbling many times. But that didn't matter.<p>The breasts felt even stranger to her, as the violent movements of the chase made it seem like they'd be torn off at any second, as they kept going in the wrong ways. But that didn't matter.<p>Her cuts and bruises became wounds and sores. But that didn't matter.<p>The only thing that mattered even to Akane was the thought of the satisfaction all of the identities could get knocking the stuffing out of the pretend panda bear!<p>"Come back here, you old fool! Haii-Yaa!" Kuh-thud-gaa!<p>{What was that? I thought the knee struck !} But still the girl- body continued the chase, leaping from height to height. She barely noticed a voice that finally had the breath to scream as it fell down into one of the springs of Juusenkyo far below the cliff.<p>She was too far away to hear a pig squeal for help.<p>By that time, she had to ask, "Where'd that panda go!"<p>Notes Below:<p>Some see the concepts of Chi and Ki as being different. It is an ancient idea that the body has a 'soul' of its own. This, Chi, is the one most often meant in "Ranma ½" since it has to do with something that can be sensed (in space-time). It is the power in the physical world, concentrated within the body as its life force. Ki is the power in the spiritual world, concentrated within the soul as its personality force, here, Akane's. Through martial arts training, the soul can use its ki to increase, refine and improve on the chi of its physical form: The battle aura. That greater chi force remains within the body. A person normally doesn't take it with them when they are reincarnated, i.e., move on to another body. There ARE techniques, though, that are ki rather than chi.<p>For example, if Ranma had some of his later abilities: Amagouriken is chi, and Akane Two-Ranma would have that technique, not Ranma One-Akane. But she wouldn't and he would be able to use Moukou Takabisha, which is ki.<p>Here, there are two bodies, with two different chi-s. But the redhead's is an accursed form. What that means will be seen later.<p>Why can't Ranma One-Akane do what Akane Two-Ranma just did? He HAS had much more training in using his ki. (A) He hasn't been informed as much as Akane as what has happened. (B) He has only ONE body, while Akane has two to compare and learn from. (C) Ranma has been conditioned by Genma (even beyond his applications of the "Id-Scrub-Down" technique) to think of women as foreign, alien, "them". (&amp;) And while Akane has similar issues with the MALE body, they're not as thoroughly ingrained into her own id. In other words, Akane is disheartened (ki).<p>v
