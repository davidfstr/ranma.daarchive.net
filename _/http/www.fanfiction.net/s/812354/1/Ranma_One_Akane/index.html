</div>Ranma One-Akane<p>By Ron Dow75<p>2: In a Lather<p>Kasumi in the same pink skirt and yellow blouse but fresh<br/>white frilly apron and matching hair bow from yesterday<br/>called from the bottom of the stairs, "Akane! Akane, are<br/>you ready?" She hesitated about going upstairs and<br/>checking on her poor baby-sister. "It's time for<br/>breakfast!"<p>Nabiki was already dressed in her slip, blue jumper with<br/>the bow in the back and short puffy sleeve white blouse<br/>school uniform. "She missed her usual morning jog. It makes<br/>me wonder just how effective this puppet-thing of Dr. Tofu<br/>is."<p>Kasumi tried to reassure herself, "The doctor said sleep<br/>was the best thing for her at that point."<p>Nabiki commented, "Just before he fell down the stairs."<br/>Why he did things like that was something nobody ever<br/>talked about with Kasumi.<p>Kasumi asked, "Didn't you say he gave her something to make<br/>her sleep through the night?"<p>Nabiki tried not to shudder. "Acupuncture." Everybody had a<br/>weak point; needles were hers.<p>Kasumi smiled, "That's good. I hear sleeping pills can be<br/>addicting. I'm sure acupuncture isn't."<p>Nabiki commented, "I should hope so."<p>Kasumi turned to look back up the stairs. "I should go and<br/>check on her."<p>Nabiki checked her watch, "Give her five more minutes. If<br/>she isn't down, she just isn't going to be keeping to her<br/>usual behavior patterns."<p>Kasumi headed up the stairs anyway. She paused to ask,<br/>"What was that word, again?"<p>Nabiki, thinking her big-sister wanted to believe in a<br/>magic word to go with the Tofu's magic spell, said, "'Wild<br/>Stallion'."<p>Kasumi nodded, but said, "Shouldn't it be 'Wild Mare'?<br/>Akane is, after all, a female."<p>Nabiki's business voice came out, "'Wild Stallion' has more<br/>punch, as they say in advertising, and that makes it more<br/>effective as a trigger." Then her tone changed, "Besides,<br/>she's not the type to be part of a herd; she creates herds.<br/>A stallion more suits her."<p>Kasumi said, "All the more reason for it to be 'mare'.<br/>You're right, though, about her being not as feminine as<br/>she could be. Do you think we can get the doctor to do<br/>something about that, too?"<p>Nabiki shook her head, "Tofu said for her to get her<br/>memories back, she has to be surrounded by familiar people,<br/>and places, doing familiar things. And doing them in the<br/>same way as she did them before."<p>Kasumi sighed, "And that means acting like, forgive me,<br/>Akane, a tomboy."<p>Nabiki checked her watch, again, "And it means going to<br/>school like she usually does. If she doesn't come down, and<br/>have her breakfast..."<p>Kasumi beamed up at the top of the stairs at the ponytailed<br/>"Akane! You dressed yourself." Dr. Tofu said amnesia could<br/>reduce a person to the level of a two-year-old.<p>"Not exactly." Feeling stupid and like a pervert, a<br/>frowning Ranma wondered how far they could see under the<br/>blue dress she had on from down there. {Don't think about<br/>it; don't sweat it; it's not my body. I'm not really a<br/>girl, so this ain't really my body they're looking at...}<p>Nabiki said, "You made it under the wire, Akane."<p>Ranma saw that the shorthaired teen was in the same dress<br/>outfit as she was in. {A school uniform. That means -Ugh!-<br/>school. And school is, is-out in public.}<p>Nabiki continued, "I don't have all that much faith in this<br/>hoodoo treatment, but if it saves us from more expensive<br/>ones, I'm glad to see it doing its magic."<p>Kasumi chided, "Nabiki!"<p>Nabiki answered, "Look, I want Akane back to as normal as<br/>she gets, too. But I think that means we need to think of<br/>back-up options: In case this one doesn't work! That's the<br/>bottom line, here."<p>Kasumi got misty-eyed, "Thank you, Nabiki."<p>Before things got saccharin, Nabiki told Akane, "Come on,<br/>and eat breakfast, so I can walk you to school!"<p>Ranma asked, "School!" She had hoped the body had dressed<br/>her this way because it didn't know she was too 'sick' to<br/>go. "Walk me?" the chances of her escape lessened again.<p>Nabiki told her, "Yes. I've been elected your baby-sitter<br/>until I can get you home."<p>Everything moved when Ranma went down the Japanese-style<br/>narrow, steep stairs. But she didn't jiggle as much as she<br/>was afraid she would. It seemed to her as if the body knew<br/>how to minimize most of the unnecessary squirming of the<br/>only firm layer of fat (Gross!} she had under her skin.<p>Kasumi put her hands together, "She moves almost normally."<p>Nabiki said, "What were you expecting? She's not a zombie."<p>Kasumi answered, "Or a clockwork doll," backing down the<br/>stairs to allow her baby-sister to come down.<p>***<p>The only action that she felt was her own, so far, was the<br/>tying up of the stupidly long hair in a ponytail in back<br/>and out of the way. {It probably looks like the older<br/>sister's. But at least there's no bow!}<p>The frown locked on an unhandsome face, Ranma found herself<br/>sitting girl-style, not boy-style on the tatami floor. Her<br/>knees were together, and her heels were under her thighs.<br/>When it was time to get up, she was sure she would rise the<br/>same way she lowered herself, with the balls of her feet,<br/>her toes gripping. Very Japanese, she'd found in her<br/>travels.<p>And it didn't let her forget that she had hips, thighs and<br/>a butt, in that order. {And a tiny waist to accent it all.}<p>Her stomach growled. {Girls do that?} she thought naively.<p>The girl's father was sitting across from her. He was famed<br/>by a view of the garden. {Don't they ever close that garden<br/>door! It's mocking me: "Escape is so close, so far..."}<br/>"Er, uh, so, Akane, how are you feeling, today?"<p>Ranma said, moodily, "I don't want to talk about it." {I<br/>wish I could stop thinking as easy. I don't want to listen<br/>to the sound of her voice at all.}<p>Nabiki sat at one end of the table, studying her more<br/>blatantly, "That's not like the Akane we know. She's let's<br/>everybody know how she feels."<p>(Mr. Tendo muttered, "I really didn't mean that kind of<br/>feeling.)<p>A kneeling, still smiling Kasumi set one of the bowls of<br/>misao soup in front of their father; "It would help you<br/>feel better. A girl has to express herself."<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow towards Kasumi but let it go. This<br/>was Akane's time.<p>Ranma snorted, "By expressing herself, you mean girls just<br/>naturally have to talk." He couldn't miss that on his<br/>travels. {Look at that, even their dad is nodding.}<p>Kasumi ladled soup into another bowl for Nabiki, who told<br/>her stubborn baby-sister, "Look, Akane, you have amnesia.<br/>Just sulking and not talking is not going to jar any<br/>memories loose."<p>Ranma glanced at her, then down {A bust.} at the place the<br/>next bowl would go. Sulking, "You don't want to hear about<br/>what I remember."<p>Judging by Akane's tone, Nabiki said, "I had a good reason<br/>to do whatever it is you remember I did to you."<p>Kasumi reminded, "Nabiki, everybody has their own<br/>perspective. I think it's encouraging she has any memories<br/>of you, no matter inconsiderate you are in them." She<br/>ladled Akane's bowl.<p>Nabiki said, "Oh? And what kind of memory fragments does<br/>she have of you? You're not ALWAYS happy and cheerful, you<br/>know."<p>Rising Japanese-style, Kasumi brought the breakfast soup<br/>over to Akane; "I always try to be: Show your own family<br/>the friendly demeanor you show to the public. It's a way to<br/>show respect to others, something that all who value the<br/>traditional Japanese ways should do."<p>The soup was placed in front of Akane. She glanced at it,<br/>then the Nabiki chick, "Does she always talk like that?"<p>Nabiki said, "No. I think she's trying to give you advice<br/>on how you should behave today." And she gave a clearly<br/>fake smile, "Japanese are famous for smiling even when they<br/>don't want to. It comes from generations of samurai slicing<br/>off the heads of whoever displeased them."<p>Peasant warrior Ranma well knew about that. But looking<br/>back at Kasumi, she had to ask, "Are you sure that's fake?"<p>***<p>They let Ranma use her lips for eating. Instead of doing<br/>his Thief-About-to-Run eating technique {Stupid Pop!<br/>Where'd he get the idea to name it that, anyway?}, she ate<br/>in a more civilized, and at a much more maddeningly slow,<br/>pace. If it weren't for the fact that the other sisters did<br/>a more lady-like job of it, Ranma would've called it eatin'<br/>dainty. {Even the dad does a better job at it. This girl<br/>must not be much of a girl. I guess I should be glad. What<br/>if I'da ended up in the example of the perfect Japanese<br/>hausfrau, Kasumi?} That sent a shudder through her. {And<br/>I'd all the time hafta smile about it!}<p>She stole glances at the other one, Nabiki. {What if it'd<br/>been her? What kinda girl is she? She don't look like she<br/>smiles much. It sounds like she keeps testin' the<br/>boundaries of her situation. Does that include wearin' more<br/>sensible underwear than this girl! -Man, this bra and<br/>panties are gettin' to me!}<p>Ranma hadn't finished, when Kasumi started clearing the<br/>table, "It's time to go, you two."<p>Ranma said, "Do I have to?" even as she rose female<br/>Japanese-style, and the skirt feeling more like a skirt.<p>Mr. Tendo suggested, "Perhaps we should allow her time to-"<p>Nabiki took her baby-sister by the shoulders and directed<br/>her towards the door to the inner hall, "Doctor's orders.<br/>As soon as Akane gets into her normal routine, the sooner<br/>her Akane act won't be an act, however wonderful that<br/>thought is."<p>Ranma agreed, "That's a wonderful thought."<p>The body, too, was reluctant to go to school, so Nabiki had<br/>to push her along.<p>After putting on their blue uniform jackets, Nabiki made<br/>Akane carry their leather bookbags. Ranma asked the taller<br/>girl, "Am I suppose to do this everyday?"<p>Nabiki toyed with the idea of saying yes. She sighed as she<br/>gave it up. "You're carrying it, so my hands are free to<br/>use on you, if you give me the first sign of trouble."<p>{So that's what having a big sister is like. Welcome to the<br/>bottom of the peckin' order, Ranma.}<p>At least she slid the door open for her.<p>Then she shoved her out into the world.<p>A cold day in March world! {How can girls stand wearin'<br/>dresses!} Ranma screamed in shock inside, as she felt the<br/>stiff, damp breeze reaching up towards her panties.<p>At the slightest lifting of the slip and skirt, the body<br/>brought both bags down to keep it in place.<p>Nabiki had to slow down, "Well, come on. Take those bags<br/>away, and let's hustle! You know what happens when you're<br/>late to school."<p>{Is it any worse than this wind?} Ranma fumed. If it was a<br/>man she was suppose to be worried about, at least then it<br/>would be somebody she could do something about. Using<br/>Ranma's martial arts skills, she might even get to get rid<br/>of some of this incredible frustration she was feeling. {If<br/>I had my freewill back, that is!}<p>With the big sister keeping within striking distance, Ranma<br/>was marched through the tidy court to the high, but open<br/>fortress-like gates. She was so intent feeling chilly, and<br/>jiggly, and girly, and stupid, and trapped, and, and things<br/>her limited vocabulary had no words for that the terrain<br/>she was passing through really didn't register in Ranma's<br/>mind. That a martial artist didn't take constant<br/>surveillance of their surroundings was a measure of just<br/>how obsessed she was. What was most new and threatening<br/>wasn't OUT there.<p>Nabiki commented, "I didn't realize the inner you was so<br/>modest."<p>Ranma heard that, but didn't know what brought that on.<br/>Another breeze tried to blow her skirt up, but pressing the<br/>bags even harder on the sides of her right and left legs<br/>kept most of it down. {From the reactions I'm gettin' from<br/>it, I think this body doesn't likes wearin' dresses almost<br/>as much as I do.}<p>Splash!<p>A wet Ranma cried, "What!" {Ain't I cold enough!}<p>The old lady in an orange kimono who'd done it to her kept<br/>on sprinkling her libation as if she wasn't aware of what<br/>she'd done.<p>Nabiki said, "The infamous 'Ladle Lady'."<p>Ranma yelled, "Who is she! If she can't see me, she can<br/>at least hear me, can't she!" She was facing more the<br/>old woman than Nabiki.<p>Nabiki again put her hands on her sister's shoulders again,<br/>and pushed her on, "Not when she's like this. She's 'in<br/>touched with the gods', 'on another plane'. I've heard<br/>she's done some strange things because 'they directed her<br/>to'. Most of them have to do with water."<p>Ranma asked, "Water? Why water?"<p>Nabiki said, "The Shinto water god is her personal patron<br/>god. Come on, let's get a towel from Dr. Tofu."<p>Ranma tried to catch a stray thought. {Isn't there<br/>something about Suijin and women...}<p>***<p>Ranma's pace, for some reason, became more brisk as they<br/>approached the doctor's clinic. She didn't have to be<br/>shoved along, or inside. {She would, if this was my idea. I<br/>hate doctors!} "I thought you said we were going to be<br/>late?"<p>Nabiki said, "We are. But as long as we are, we might as<br/>well be late enough to avoid the Big Scene."<p>Ranma asked, "'Big Scene'?"<p>A man's strong and kindly voice said, "Akane! Nabiki! This<br/>is a pleasant surprise." He wore a black martial arts' gi.<p>Ranma said, {I want to yell!}, "You're, you're the one who<br/>pulled the sneak attack on me yesterday." {He didn't even<br/>give me a chance to use whatever martial skills I have<br/>left! -Why couldn't this body give me decent show of<br/>righteous indignation!}<p>The brown-brunette said, "I merely applied a Vulcan nerve<br/>pinch."<p>Nabiki was not amused, "Doctor, please! No jokes. Akane's<br/>in no condition to appreciate them."<p>Dr. Tofu leaned forward, moving his Western-style glasses<br/>as he studied Akane; "How is our patient, today? I trust<br/>the turtle-over-snake technique I applied has her at least<br/>acting like her old self."<p>Ranma felt her heat rising, "You're, you're the one<br/>responsible for this... this... -Too! I have to be act like<br/>a girl because of you!" Her heart started beating faster.<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Curious reaction."<p>Nabiki just rolled her eyes up. "She's more of a tomboy<br/>than we thought."<p>The good doctor said, "I don't know about that. Akane's<br/>body appears to be flushed. Her pupils are dilated. And her<br/>breathing rate has increased."<p>Ranma could hear the blood pumping in her ears.<p>Nabiki defended her sister's (and thereby her family's, and<br/>thereby her own) reputation, "Surely you're not one of<br/>those who believes just because we all know she acts like a<br/>boy she doesn't like boys."<p>The educated man said, "Of course not."<p>Her feverish skin becoming moist, Ranma struggled to tell<br/>them-HIM!- "Well... I... don't. I, don't, like, boys." The<br/>signals in her crotch were arguing something else. {What a<br/>time to find I have a piece of my manhood left! Stupid:<br/>You're barking up the wrong tree, here!}<p>Nabiki said, sarcastically, "That's obvious." If it were<br/>anybody but the trusted, and observant, family doctor,<br/>Nabiki would've been more embarrassed for them both. To<br/>Tofu, she said, "We came in here to dry her off. May we<br/>borrow a towel and leave before she starts to, 'drool'?"<p>Tofu said, "Uh, yes. We can't let her appear at school, uh,<br/>wet."<p>Under her uniform's jacket, {Stupid, irritatin', too big,<br/>copycat nipples!} Ranma discovered yet something else<br/>boobs did to bug her.<p>As the handsome man turned to fetch one, Nabiki asked, "You<br/>wouldn't have a secret technique to... Never mind! I guess<br/>it's really something a guy wouldn't be interested in<br/>knowing."<p>***<p>Bookbags in hand, Ranma was still a little unsteady in her<br/>white ankle socks and deck shoes as they hurried off to<br/>school. The skirt flagging behind her, the bra only<br/>limiting the range of the bounces, she had something worse<br/>on her mind, "It feels like I'm wearing a diaper."<p>Nearly beside her, Nabiki said, "Of course they do! We need<br/>something to keep you from embarrassing everybody! For a<br/>moment there, I thought you might flow like any girl in a<br/>hentai manga."<p>Ranma told her, "I'm not a pervert!" {I just feel like one!<br/>The wrong kind, too: Gettin' bothered over a guy! If it'd<br/>let me, I'd puke.}<p>Nabiki said, "Let's hope not! Your conscious is not really<br/>in control of the brakes right now. Just make sure you see<br/>me in the third floor girls room after your first period<br/>(an unfortunate homonym)."<p>Ranma challenged her, "Why!" She had been starting to<br/>feel her own-self coming out. {And I don't mean the stupid,<br/>weak-kneed girl's! A real girl wouldn't be this pissed!}<p>Nabiki told her why, "To make sure you get a new pad! We<br/>don't want your scent attracting the animals. You already<br/>have enough boys after you when you DON'T give them any<br/>encouragement!"<p>Ranma told her, "Just let any boy get near me, and I'll<br/>give them encouragement!" And as a demonstration of her<br/>meaning, she raised one of the bags, her small hand a fist<br/>around its handle.<p>Nabiki almost smiled. "That's the attitude! It would've<br/>been too strange to think underneath it all you were really<br/>boy-crazy."<p>Despite and because of all of the novel sensations, Ranma<br/>burned off some of her fury by speeding up, "I'm not! I<br/>hate boys!" She started developing a double-handed martial<br/>arts bookbag technique: "Hate boys! Hate boys! I really,<br/>really hate BOYS!" {Damn unmanly nipples!}<p>***<p>After a winding jog with four intersections, they came to<br/>an extra long block. At its end were the walls of a large<br/>compound. The wide entrance with its out-of-sight gate up<br/>ahead suggested that it was meant to be a public place.<br/>Looking over the wall, Ranma saw the clock tower so common<br/>to Japanese schools. It read '8:35'.<p>Matching her, now, Nabiki said, "At least we're not as late<br/>as we could've been. At least we should be able to get you<br/>to class without the Big Scene."<p>{There, she said it again.} "WHAT Big Scene?"<p>They had just turned into the gate, when: "Fairest, most<br/>worthy Akane..."<p>Nabiki slowed to a halt, groaning, "Unless, that is, we run<br/>into Kuno-Baby."<p>She glared at 'Shooting Star', the president of the<br/>Furinkan High kendo club as he held his wooden bokken sword<br/>out towards them. "...the only girl to truly challenge this<br/>samurai's heart, I have composed an ode to thee. 'There<br/>once was a girl from Nerima, who liked to'-"<p>Nabiki yelled, "Kuno! Stop it right now: Stop ALL of it!<br/>Because of you, Akane's not herself! You got a strike on<br/>her, and now, and now-" Nabiki became choked up. 'No!<br/>Mustn't let anybody see me like this! I don't let things<br/>get to me! I'm the Ice Queen!'<p>She turned to Akane behind her, "Well, just don't stand<br/>there-Cream the creep!"<p>{I think that's what this body wants to do,} Ranma growled<br/>in disgust. After dropping the bookbags, the girl's body<br/>had become frozen, unable to take its eyes off of the<br/>stupid jerk wearing a kendo-uniform at school during school<br/>hours. {Okay: So girls might find him tall and handsome<br/>with a good physique-but he was nothing to soak the bandage<br/>that doctor gave me to put in the panties, is he!}<p>Nabiki cried, "Akane! What's your problem? Where's your<br/>programmed response! Kuno's the bell, and you're Pavlov's<br/>dog: Sic 'em!"<p>Kuno lowered his bokken. "Then it is true. At long last I<br/>have won my prize. I do not know whether I should be<br/>exultant in my hard fought victory, so earnestly..."<p>Nabiki yelled, "Akane! Don't tell me-Tell EVERYBODY-you<br/>really do have feelings for the jerk!"<p>{DOES this stupid Akane-girl have feelings for this first<br/>(samurai, upper-) class creep!} Ranma just didn't know!<br/>She did not know how to interpret the sensations the body<br/>was giving her. They were certainly different from the one<br/>it felt when she was at the clinic. {I've never been good<br/>at knowin' with my own feelings, let ALONE a girl's!}<p>The six-foot-tall boy hadn't broken from his speech, "...or<br/>lament the loss of a will that was as a whetstone to the<br/>sword of my..."<p>Nabiki cried, "Akane! Don't let him finish his speech!"<p>Suddenly the rumbling that had been building reached the<br/>level on the Richter scale that it could no long be<br/>ignored. It might have been thought an earthquake if it<br/>weren't accompanied by a growing din of voices.<p>Teenage boys' voices!<p>The main doors of the broke open at their hinges as a surge<br/>of high-schoolers in sports uniforms, boxing-shorts, sumo<br/>loin clothes, fencing protectors, leotards, or martial<br/>arts-gi/uniforms came rushing out! And they all gave voice<br/>to one name: "Akane!"<p>"Akane! Don't waste yourself on him!"<p>"I love you, Akane!"<p>"If you're open, let ME be your match!"<p>"Meet me, Akane!"<p>"Akane, sugar, honey, stick with me!"<p>"Try your indiscriminate grappling with me!"<p>"Let me serenade you with my El Kabong!"<p>"You're too much of a woman for one man!"<p>"You're our idol, Akane!"<p>"We love you!"<p>"...Nay! The fruits of love triumphant should not just be<br/>savored, but enjoyed! I come to you, Ak-" Kuno's speech was<br/>cut short when he was trampled by the horde.<p>And still Akane was like a deer caught in the headlights-Of<br/>a bullet train! Nabiki shouted with all her might:<br/>"WILD STALLION!"<p>"RANMA!" Ranma answered, leaping into the middle of the<br/>assault of boys. {I'm outa the spell!} She punched,<br/>deflected, dragon-clawed, and ducked. {Yes! I'm back to<br/>actin' like myself!} She chopped, evaded, jabbed, and<br/>rolled away from a lucky hit. {I'm doin' what I'm best at:<br/>Martial arts!} She elbowed, kneed, and even back-kicked!<br/>{This is who I am!} "RANMA means THE WILD STALLION!"<p>The End
