</div><p>The Melting Process</p><p>by Ryoga's Best friend</p><p>A/N- A very special thanks to Chikiko, I was just looking through those who had me on the favorites lists and author alerts to boost my already substantial ego and saw this was one her favorite stories and I didn't think anyone really liked it. So I decided to at least start continuing it some.</p><p>Recap:</p><p>"Stupid gnome" she whispered to herself as she set to work picking up her things. After she finished cleaning the reality sank in that something important was missing. "My notebook" she almost squeaked, that was far too personal to fall into someone else's hands. She frantically searched her room, as she checked under her bed she heard the window open and then shut. Nabiki looked up to see her notebook on the windowsill, she stood and slowly approached it. Taped to the cover was a small note which read simply, 'Begin the melting process'.</p><p>And so we reenter…</p><p>Part 2</p><p>It had been a few days since school let out and she got the strange message but nothing yet had happened. Though those days had done some good. She got to catch up on her reading, listen to music and best of all Ranma had seemed to keep his more rambunctious activities away from the house. It seemed it would truly be a vacation. That last thought brought up some issues just occurring to the middle Tendo. "Ranma's been acting different lately, a little calmer, nicer maybe." She said to herself. Now it was no great improvement mind you, just enough that it made her wonder. That something was going on. "Nah, Ranma's probably just toning down some cause it's break is all." She rationalized sitting up and heading to grab a snack. She opened the door to she Ranma there about to knock, he stood there for a moment with his hand up looking like an idiot. It was a scene she happily watched behind a neutral expression. He slowly lowered his fist to scratch behind his head, thoroughly embarrassed.</p><p>"Something you want Saotome?" she said dryly, holding back a chuckle at his expression.</p><p>"yeah, ah. I was wonderin' if ya wanted to…Well ya see I got these…" he said awkwardly trying to find the right words.</p><p>"Just spit it out. I'm a busy woman here." She said despite she had not planned for that day.</p><p>"Jeez, I was Just wanted to know if ya'd go see this with me." He said finally indicating the tickets in his hand. <i>Hmmm, how come I didn't notice those before? </i>Was a stray thought through Nabiki's head before the question really hit home. <i>He want's to go out with me?…Something's up here…</i> She thought narrowing her eyes, she didn't like being played with.</p><p>"What kind of joke is this Saotome? What's you angle?" she asked coldly.</p><p>"Angle? Look Pops pressured me into getting this tickets to go with Akane, but we had a…disagreement earlier." He said rubbing the top of his head, and not doubt a mallet related injury. "I Paid for the dang things and I didn't want them to o to waste so I thought why not." He said with a shrug. Nabiki still wasn't convinced.</p><p>"Why not just go with Shampoo or Ukyo? I'm sure they'd be thrilled." She raised an eyebrow at Ranma's reply, he gave a snort.</p><p>"You kidding? And have pops and Mr. Tendo skin me alive? No thank you. I didn't want a date in the first place anyway. I figure If I go with you no one will blow it out of proportion." He reasoned, which was odd enough as it is, but it made a lot of sense. It wasn't like the martial artist had any reliable friends, only a few aquinances who would turn on him if the odds were in their favor. In that way he was not unlike herself, though she wouldn't admit it to him.</p><p>"I guess so…this isn't some stupid martial arts movie is it?" She asked crossing her arms. He shook his head.</p><p>"Nah, 'kane got pissed off last time I did that. This is some kinda murder mystery or something like that…" He said trailing off. Nabiki was pleasantly surprised for sure, Mysteries were her favorite kind of movie. She always liked the challenge of trying to figure them out before the main character.</p><p>"That'll do, but your paying for the food." She said firmly.</p><p>"Wha, come on. That'll clean me out!" He complained but was not met with sympathy. "Feh, Fine. Just be ready by 6:00." He grumbled as he when back down the hall hands in his pockets. After he was out of sight she gained a small smile, <i>A free trip to the movies…Even if it's with Ranma that's not such a bad deal.</i> She thought as she headed back into the room for and glanced into the mirror.</p><p>"hmmm, if I'm going out I should probably dress up some…. In case I meet some cute guy while I'm out." She added the last part as if she were afraid people were listening and getting the wrong idea. No way she'd dress up for Ranma, he'd just be going in the same red shirt and black pants anyway.</p><p>Few hours flew pretty quick as the summer day went by uneventful for a Nermia day anyway. Nabiki was making late minute preparations when there was a knock on her door. "Come on Nabiki, we're gonna be late if ya don't hurry." Came the impatient voice of Ranma from the other side of the door.</p><p>"Please Ranma a woman like to take her time to get ready when going out." Nabiki teased as she checked herself over in the mirror at the finished product. She was wearing tight maroon shirt and complimenting mini-skirt, now she originally wasn't planning on something so nice but she figured that she could have plenty of fun messing with her fellow movie goer if the movie ended up being no good. She put on a nice pair of flats and made her way out. "I'm ready" she said as she opened the door.</p><p>"Bout frickin ti-ah" his thought process stalled and a blush rose to his face. Nabiki stifled a laugh, this was just as she was hoping for.</p><p>"I take it you like?" She asked with a smirk. He gave a small nodded as he was jump starting his brain. "I wonder what Akane would say if she found you staring at he delicate older sister." She said innocently to no one in particular and that was the trigger he needed.</p><p>"W-whatever…lets just get going." He managed a stuttered reply, still a bit shaken up. She snickered and followed him downstairs, she took the oppertunity to notice that he cleaned up pretty well. He was wearing one of his nicer Chinese outfits. A blue shirt and black pants, but they had definitely seen less fighting then most of his clothes. The arrived at the bottom of the stairs to find and irate Akane glaring at them.</p><p>"Jerk," She growled as she stomped off. Ranma shook his head.</p><p>"Guess she's still sore about it" Nabiki stated she followed Ranma out. A muffled 'Yeah' followed after the door closed. Akane watched sadly not nearly as angry. <i>Going out to a movie with my sister…He didn't even ask me…</i> at that thought she sighed and slowly made her way upstairs.</p><p>The pair left the theater a few hours later relatively pleased with the film. Nabiki was talking about the movie with a small smile, it had been quite a story. A detective ended up on this yacht with this crazy rich family and that night the unliked family patriarch is killed and he has to solve the murder while trapped on the boat with the killer. "I can believe that twist I would have never suspected that mousy artist, I didn't think he had the guts to do it." Nabiki said firmly.</p><p>"I don't know, He seemed kinda sketchy to me. Reminded me a lot of Gos…" Ranma replied thoughtfully.</p><p>"Hikaru Gosunkugi?" She asked with a laugh. "Are you nuts?"</p><p>"Nah, seriously. I mean that freaky guy in the movie was all obsessed with his cousin, the girl engaged to the guy who got framed? He seemed pretty spineless but when no one expected it he went and off'd the old man. I'm not calling Gos a killer I'm just saying he was similar." He explained with a shrug.</p><p>"hmm, when you put it that way I guess I can see what your saying." She relented, eyeing the martial artist. "Your pretty sharp Saotome. When you want to be."</p><p>"Ah, Thanks, I think…" he said unsure how to accept the backhanded comment. "You have to be with people out to kill you on a daily basis." He added with a small sigh. Before the middle Tendo could comment on the strange behavior he cut her off. "Well I seem to have a little money left, want to grab a snack?" He asked in his usual carefree tone.</p><p>"Um, Okay…but not one of your Fiancee's places. I don't feel like dealing with any misinterpretations." She said with a small wag of her finger.</p><p>"ah man…" he groaned. He figured he could get more bang for his buck if he went to Ucchan's or the Nekohaten. "All right, but don't expect anything too fancy." He grumbled as they continued through the streets of Nermia.</p><p>They had stumbled across a decent noodle cart a few blocks away and had a pretty good meal while they made some unimportant small talk about recent happenings in the area. An hour later they finally found themselves back on the doorstep at home and headed back in. "You know Saotome that was pretty fun I'll have to admit. Maybe your not the dumb jock I thought you were," She said with a little smirk.</p><p>"Dumb jock? Whatever gave you-" he found himself speechless again for the second time that night as the middle Tendo leaned in and gave him a peck on the cheek.</p><p>"Night Ranma," She said with a wink as she ascended the stairs leaving her companion frozen at the bottom of the stairs. She reached her room and broke into snickers. "He's so fun to tease," she said to herself as she took a seat on the bed. <i>But that was a lot of fun…that had to be the most fun I've had since on a date…</i> her thought trailed off when she realized she'd been on a date with Ranma Saotome, Marital Arts playboy. On top of that Nothing bad had happened, his mysterious chaos completely absent to whole evening. "I even gave him a goodnight kiss…" she was silent for a long time just staring at the ceiling unsure of what to think.</p><p>Meanwhile in a room just down the hall Ranma groaned as he stared into his empty wallet. "It was a good first step but I'm not sure I can afford this plan if it keeps up like this…" He said with a sigh laying back on his futon. He absentmindedly rubbed his cheek as he stared at the ceiling. "I can't believe she kissed me…" he said in wonder before falling silent for the rest of the night.</p><p>Continued later on…</p><p>A/N- Alright, I wrote this up pretty fast. I'm surprised it came to me so easily. Anyway I hope this is a sign of jump-started creativity that I've been lacking for some time. Also anyone who might have noticed the "mystery movie" I made was the semi description of a Dectective conan episode I saw, a cookie for anyone who knew that...Please Send any comment/Criticisms my way. Flames will be used to heat the water to reverse my Jusenkyo curse ; ) Je Ne everyone!</p>
