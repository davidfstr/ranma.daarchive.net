</div><p>Authors Notes Yes, the Ranma scene is from the Manga, volume  38. I felt that I wasn't being canon  enough in the original version of the Prologue, and thus I have this  rewrite. Remember, in the Wheel of Time  series, the snake people are the Aelfinn and they give answers to questions  while the fox people are the Eelfinn and they grant three requests… for a  price. Why the Saffron scene? Perhaps because I feel that this is the best  point in the Ranma storyline for a divergence, at least where this story comes  in. Of course I added in some things to  the scene, but the dialogue is directly from the translation I have of the  Manga, save substituting "jerk" for "baka."  Also in this story, any Japanese people who encounter the Eelfinn will  call them "kitsune." They will also call  the Aelfinn "daija." I will also be  skipping certain parts of the Saffron battle as they are happening during the  interlaced scenes. I've noticed that   is cutting out the "P" and the dash in "P (dash) chan." So  whenever I need to use that term, if at all, I will be using "Pchan"  instead. Oh, and I've been told that I  don't really have too good of a sense of humor, thus any jokes that seem bad,  well… I'm trying aren't I?</p><p>Disclaimer: I do not own Ranma 1/2. That honor goes to  Rumiko Takahashi and her publishers: Viz and Kitty Films. I do not own the Wheel of Time series. The honor for that one goes to Robert Jordan  and Tor books. I also do not claim  ownership of any other series that may get mentioned within this piece of  fanfiction. I do however claim ownership  of my story. It's mine, if you ever,  EVER, want to continue it on the off chance that I do decide to drop it, then  you must e-mail me. However, I don't see  that happening.</p><p></p><p>1/2 an Age</p><p>By: Ellfangor8 (Ellf)</p><p></p><p>Prologue (Rewritten):  The Will of the Pattern, or is it Kitsune?</p><p>Standing upon the side of a massive mountain was a lone  man. The man, a boy really, with his  hair up in a pigtail, wearing a red silk shirt with wooden buttons and black  dungarees, was holding an icy blue staff.  The staff had a glaive-like blade sitting atop it. The man was none other than Saotome Ranma,  and the staff in his hand was the Gekkaja, the key to the Dragon Tap of  Jusendo. The cold water from the Dragon  Tap was needed to restore Akane to her proper form. Ranma glared icily up at his flying  antagonist, a man with fiery orange locks that wavered behind him as his white  wings kept him aloft. His clothing was a  regal Chinese tunic with a cape flapping behind him due to the flapping  wings. This was Saffron, the prince of Phoenix Mountain; the Phoenix-God. He needed the hot water from the Phoenix Tap  of Jusendo to complete his ascension so that he could provide light to his  people. Ranma's confidence shone on his  face as bright as his glare was icy; however, this was a façade. He wasn't so sure that he could beat him now.</p><p><i>I cut off his wings  and they just grew back… What a gyp! How  am I supposed to beat this asshole now!</i></p><p>Up above Ranma, Saffron cackled. The puny landling had no chance of survival  against the likes of him. Such a  fool! It was time to let the mortal know  his place; he would pay for interrupting his transformation.</p><p>"Heh, fool. I am  immortal, landling. To even defeat me on  this day, you would have to cut my entire body to pieces." The Phoenix prince smirked.  "But then, to do that…" Saffron reached  his hand back and viciously tore off one of his wings. His voice increased in  volume as his tone radiated arrogance. "YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET CLOSE TO ME! LOTS  OF LUCK, LANDLING SCUM!"</p><p>Ranma's mask of confidence shattered to be replaced by  confusion. "He tore off his own wing?"</p><p><i>Now why the hell would  the bastard do that?</i></p><p>Saffron appeared to be charging up for an attack, at least  that was as near as the young martial artist could tell. A corona of fire surrounded the Phoenix-God,  becoming brighter and stronger as he spun the wing around his body at an increasing  speed. When Saffron finally reached the  peak of his attack, he cried: "Kotei  Kaen Yoti!" (Blazing Emperor's Wing)  The fiery circle was launched at the young martial artist who  desperately moved to get away from the blast.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in a room of the Tendo home was what can only be  described as an old gnome-like man. Most  men this man's age were long dead, and others weren't even human. From looking at him one wouldn't be able to  know it, but this was the Grandmaster of the school of Anything Goes   Martial Arts.  With only his purple gi on, he sat in the center of two piles. The pile to his left was what he considered  his prize collection: a pile of women's undergarments sorted by color and  style. On his right, however, was a pile  of things that were very valuable to him, more so than his prize  collection. It was a pile of scrolls and  tomes. It was this pile that he looked  through today.</p><p>"Hmm… <i>Pressure Points for Dummies</i>; I don't  know why I picked that one up." He  tossed the yellow and black book over to the side. The aged man picked up another scroll.</p><p>"Oh… this one looks interesting… <i>How to Cure a Jusenkyo Curse</i>.  Nah, it looks too complicated. I  guess I'll tear this one up." He held  the scroll up with both hands, and with a speed that rivaled that of Ranma's  Amaguriken, proceeded to rip it to shreds.</p><p>"Ah… Here we go… <i>The Three Wishes of the Kitsune</i>. Three wishes, eh? I think this one could work for me." He opened the scroll and began to read from  it. As he read it, the elderly martial  artist began to grin. The grin  progressively got wider as he finished it.</p><p>"The location…. Hehehehe!  Sweeto! It's not too far outside  of town!" Happosai ran out the door,  barely taking the time to nod to Soun.</p><p></p><p>"It is time to end this little dance! Die Ranma!" The Phoenix prince exclaimed  as he unleashed another fireball towards Ranma.  Ranma was tugging at the Gekkaja which was stuck in the ground with its  blade bent at a ninety degree angle to the staff before noticing the inferno  sphere. Luckily, Ranma managed to jump  out of the blast's way, and the enormous fireball struck the ground near the  staff. As the light faded, the pigtailed  martial artist noticed that the Gekkaja was still there, and was water vapor  coming up from the rocks around it?</p><p><i>What is going on here?  The whole area is steaming, but there is no water there. AH! Maybe the Gekkaja's shape isn't because  it's broken, but that's how to turn it on!  I still have a chance!</i></p><p>With that thought Ranma began to run wildly for the Gekkaja.</p><p>"You are a fool to expose yourself!" Saffron yelled. He began to charge up another fireball to  toss at Ranma.</p><p>"Play with this for a while, feather brain!" Ranma tossed some clothing up in the air,  presumably containing Akane. Saffron  paused at that and a look of confusion passed over his face.</p><p>"How could you? Using  the girl who gave her life for you as a shield on purpose! YOU SCUM!  You disgust even me!" As the  clothing got closer to Saffron, he noticed that it was just twigs. "AH! A fake, damn you!" Saffron incinerated  the false doll with his flames as he launched the fire blast at Ranma.</p><p>"Damn straight!" Ranma stood ready for the blast as he struck  the ground with the Gekkaja and pulled up a rock that was instantaneously  frozen. As the fireball struck the rock,  it melted. It was as Ranma suspected;  the keys were exact opposites. The  Gekkaja was an ice weapon and the Kinjakan was the fire weapon. The young  martial artist began to strike the ground with the Gekkaja, causing bits of  rock to come up. If one was looking  carefully, they could see that the outcroppings of ice were beginning to form a  spiral. This move would be perfect to  use against Saffron.</p><p>As he watched Ranma, Saffron made a snide comment, "What are  you digging up the ground for, foolish landling! You won't need to dig your  own grave! I'll leave only your ashes!"</p><p>Ranma, standing at the center of the ice spiral, looking at  Saffron, replied "Oh, yeah? It's party time, bakayaro!"</p><p>As the blast descended towards Ranma, he smirked. This brat was making it easy for this move to  work.</p><p>"For endangering Akane's life, YOU WILL PAY! HIRYUU SHOTEN  HA!" Ranma thrust his fist into the air in  a spiraling motion, causing a disruption in the convection current around  him. The result from this move is  normally a tornado relative to the opponent's strength and anger. Because of the size of the fireball, the  resultant tornado was massive, taller than the mountain of Kenseizan. The tornado formed around both combatants,  sucking them in.</p><p></p><p>The aged grandmaster smiled as he came upon the arch that  the scroll described. It was made of red  stone and was so twisted that it hurt even Happosai's eyes to gaze upon it.  Running down the edges of the doorway were three lines of etched  triangles. The arch was leaning against  the wall of a cave. The old pervert  decided to gather his courage and walk through it. Boy would he feel stupid if it turned out  that the arch did not work, but the scrolls he "liberated" never lied  before. Nor did they this time. As soon as Happosai set foot through the door  he was transported to another world.</p><p>A person greeted the elderly martial artist as he entered  the realm. However, this person was not  human; Happosai glanced up at the creature.  It was wearing a robe that accented its fox-like face. Fur covered its body as its tail twitched  behind it. Happi stared and then  realized that this one… this one was female.  It was blaringly obvious because of the shape of the creature's body and  the… ahem… ample upper torso. The  elderly pervert's mind was torn between glomping this creature, stealing her  undergarments and running away, or staying, behaving and getting his  wishes. No matter how piercing his  instincts were, he beat them back with a twelve-foot stick in his mind and  settled for staring in awe at the beauty of the creature.</p><p>"Kitsune…" he murmured.  The fox-like creature seemed to grin down at Happi. She spoke in  Japanese.</p><p>"Ah, Japanese are you, good, good. Have you complied with the agreement? No lamps, no torches, no iron nor any musical  instruments."</p><p>Happosai nodded curtly.  "Of course not, Kitsune-san. I  follow what the scrolls tell me."</p><p>"Excellent, then let's bring you before <i>them</i> shall we?"</p><p>"Lead on, Kitsune-san, lead on."</p><p>The being that Happosai identified as Kitsune led the aged  grandmaster down a hallway decorated with various plants that gave off a  light. He walked slowly behind the  female Eelfinn, gazing in wonder at the surroundings, at how different and yet  the same this world was to their own. He was brought to a large door with  markings of both foxes and snakes etched upon it. The Kitsune gestured for him to go in.</p><p></p><p>Ranma smirked as he headed towards Saffron in the tornado  created by his Hiryuu Shoten Ha. He had  never felt this good in a fight before, nor had he ever felt this terrible. It was almost as if there was an additional  energy crawling beneath his skin. He  knew this fight was for Akane's life, but he felt wonderful! He felt nauseous. Chills went up and down his spine as he  thought about winning. He would win at  all costs. As the feeling coursed  through him he approached Saffron from behind.</p><p>"Eat this, bastard! GEKKAJA!" Ranma swung the ice key at Saffron, hoping  that it would strike a vital part. At  the last minute, Saffron raised his right arm to block the blow. Because the staff connected, Saffron's upper  right half of his body began to freeze solid.  As he held the staff in place he asked, "Who's the fool? I knew full well that the tornado wouldn't  blow you away, but it's all the cover I need to get in close to you! YOU ARROGANT SCUM! You think you're so superior! That no one  else matters! You nearly killed Akane! For this, YOU WILL DIE!"</p><p>"DAMN YOU!"</p><p>As Ranma held tightly on to the staff, he glanced down at  the doll-Akane in his shirt. He hoped  that she would be alright. When glancing  down, he saw a small aura of gold, but he didn't understand what that  meant. However, that aura was slowly  fading.</p><p>Shing! Saffron managed to push the Gekkaja away when he  spotted the Kinjakan.</p><p>"Damn it!" Ranma shouted.</p><p>"The Kinjakan! This isn't over yet!" Saffron flew towards  the opposite key and grasped it. "Heh! I WILL NEVER YIELD! Just try your futile  attack again! I will prove the error of your ways by death!"</p><p>Ranma gripped the Gekkaja tighter as he replied, "If you want  it, you're gonna get all you can handle and then some!"</p><p>Ranma directed himself towards Saffron, winding up for  another strike. As he swung at the  Phoenix Prince, Saffron countered with the Kinjakan. CLANG! There was the sound of metal against  metal as both the martial artist and the god held their respective staffs  together. Suddenly, there was a flash of  power coming from both staffs. Their  attacks were repelling each other. There  were two colliding spheres of power being perfectly repelled back at the  wielders of the staffs. The cold attack  was being directed back at Ranma!</p><p></p><p>The room Happosai was in was decorated with all sorts of  insignia. Odd plants that gave off a dim  light lit the room, and regal red carpets were spread out on the floor. The architecture of the room seemed a  combination of the Western Victorian style along with some Asian influences to  it. Etched on the walls were several  glyphs in a language not known to men.  The Eelfinn were known to be fairly reminiscent of days long past,  however this did not explain the modern architecture. Perhaps this Age had brought so much that  they wanted to keep some memorabilia.  Three of the fox-like people, one female and two males, walked into the  room, barely acknowledging Happosai at first.  The males each had brownish fur and were wearing green robes with a  silver fox head medallion around their necks.  The female, unlike the males, had snow white fur and was wearing a sky  blue robe. She too was wearing the  silver fox head medallion. They arranged  themselves so that the female would be sitting in between the two males. After getting situated in the room, they turned  their attention to Happosai.</p><p>The male on the left spoke, "What is it that you want, elder  one?"</p><p>"I have heard that there is a price to pay for the favors  you grant. Let me tell you my offer  first."</p><p>The foxes seemed to grin at that, and the female one  spoke. "One who knows of the agreement,  very well elder one, make your offer of price."</p><p>Happosai grinned with an almost evil glint in his eye. "I offer the two heirs to the Anything Goes  School as payment for your favors. Akane  Tendo, the heiress to the Tendo School, and Ranma Saotome, the heir to the Saotome School are yours to do with what you  will."</p><p>The male on the right spoke next, "You offer us your  heirs? You are one truly s-" He was  pulled to the side by the other two and they spoke to each other in a tongue  that even Happosai could not understand.  As they conferred, it seemed that the female was becoming more and more  agitated. Finally it seemed that they  reached an agreement as the first one turned to Happosai and spoke. The other two grinned slyly as they nodded in  agreement.</p><p>"We will accept your offer, elder one. Now make your requests."</p><p></p><p>Ranma was panting hard as he held the Gekkaja in his  hand. He had just finished hitting  Saffron with the rocks that Ryoga had thrown into the tornado. Saffron fell into the center, and it seemed  that Ranma could relax. However, this  was not to be… A pillar of boiling hot lava began to rise up from the tornado's  center. A side comment from Ryoga Hibiki  pointed out that Saffron's heat was now of molten proportions; he must have  melted the rock. Of course, this was a  true comment as the Phoenix Prince flew up from beneath the lava, snarling,  with an aura of flame surrounding him.</p><p>"How DARE you strike royalty! You landling peasant!"</p><p>"Damn it! What does  it take to bring this bastard down? Neither Akane nor I can take much more of  this." Ranma was genuinely worried. He needed to figure a way to take Saffron  down, permanently. The power that felt  so good continued to well up inside of him.</p><p>Saffron chuckled as he watched Ranma. "Planning your own funeral, mortal? Well, you should! Mount   Phoenix Royal Family  Special Attack…" There was a bright  flash of light, obscuring Saffron from Ranma's view.</p><p>"What now!"</p><p>"TENKA SHUNMETSU KOUKYUU DAN!" (Any-mortal  Instant-Annihilation Emperor-Sized Ball Blast)  And a mammoth fireball headed towards Ranma.</p><p></p><p>The aged pervert stood in front of the foxes,  considering. He knew what he wanted, but  if he didn't word them right he could be screwed over. Happosai was eager to get his wishes, but he  didn't want to do it wrong. The foxes  began to look impatient and the Grandmaster of Anything Goes began to give his  first request.</p><p>"For my first request, I ask that you return me to my prime  once more."</p><p>The male fox on the left gestured at Happosai and suddenly  where the elderly pervert stood was now a young man at the age of sixteen years  old. However this was not the form that  was seen by Ranma and Akane when they went back in time with the Naban  Mirror. This body had red hair, and it  was taller.</p><p>"Done."</p><p>"My next request is for a pretty lady that I can call my  own."</p><p>The right side male fox gave the appearance of raising an  eyebrow before gesturing.</p><p>"Looking to get some romance? Done."</p><p>Happosai nodded then glanced hungrily at the third fox  person.</p><p>"My third request, my dear, is one that only you can  fulfill."</p><p>The fox in question blinked.  "Oh? How is that?"</p><p>Happosai grinned, not as disturbing as it would have been  had he still been in his elderly form, but it still gave the Eelfinn the  chills. "I would like you to…"</p><p>"Yes?" Now it is odd for one of the Eelfinn to be confused  for they are almost omniscient, but this one was rather baffled by what  Happosai wanted.</p><p>"Give me your panties!"</p><p>All three of the foxes did something that they would  probably never do again. They face  faulted. Like with most face faults,  they recovered to their feet quickly.</p><p>With a blush on her face, she held her hands out to the  young Happosai. "Done."</p><p>The young pervert rubbed the undergarment, which had a hole  in the back to make room for the fox's tail, all over his face. "Ahahahaoh. How sweet it is!"</p><p>The foxes glanced at Happosai once more before sending him  to leave. "We will collect our price as  soon as you leave."</p><p>The female glared at Happosai as he left the room and began  to cackle. "There is one more stipend to  the price, Happosai. You will have no  recollection of this or anything. Have  fun with your new life 'Ataru Moroboshi'!"</p><p></p><p>The gargantuan ball of flame was so powerful that it  literally blew the top off of Kenseizan, exposing the Dragon and Phoenix  Taps. Ranma made a split-second decision  to turn the Gekkaja's icy powers upon himself so that he could survive. The Tenku Shunmetsu Koukyuu Dan passed  harmlessly over the pigtailed martial artist's body, but it knocked him outside  of the Hiryuu Shoten Ha. Saffron realized  that Ranma had survived and threw the top of the Kinjakan like a boomerang to  bring the aqua transsexual back into the cyclone. Meanwhile, Ranma was planning his next  strike.</p><p><i>I only have one chance  to take this bastard down, and that's during his next attack. I'll thrust my frozen fist into the attack  and he'll be torn to ribbons by the concentrated Hiryuu Shoten Ha!</i></p><p>Saffron began to charge up another one of his attacks. The attack, like last time was a humongous  fireball.</p><p>"TENKA SHUNMETSU KOUKYUU DAN!" The blast headed towards  Ranma once more. The raging inferno of  the fireball was so bright that it was blinding Ranma's sight.</p><p>"Argh! Can't see a thing because of the fire!" Ranma was shielding his eyes. Suddenly, out of his shirt leaped the Akane  Doll, who was still frozen like Ranma was, and into the fire she went, creating  a tunnel in the fireball that led directly to Saffron.</p><p>"Foolish Girl, how many times do you want to die? My blast shall incinerate you!"</p><p>"NOT IN THIS LIFETIME, BASTARD! HIRYUU SHOTEN HA REVISED:"  Ranma thrust his fist into the tunnel.  "Go Dragon of Ice! HIRYUU  HYOUTOPPA!" A horizontal tornado left  his hand, heading towards Saffron. The tornado struck Saffron, tearing him to  shreds.</p><p>"B-but… I'm immortal!"</p><p>Unbeknownst to Ranma, in the center, threads of Air, Earth,  Fire, Spirit and Water were woven together to form a white-hot stream of fire  that struck Saffron shortly after the tornado did, causing Saffron to disappear  in a flash of white light, leaving no body behind.</p><p>"Not as immortal as you might think."</p><p>The Akane doll flew into Ranma's arms, and around them  formed a silver sphere with a fox-head symbol that seemed to be engraved upon  it. Inside the sphere, Ranma collapsed  into unconsciousness, dropping Akane in the process, however his hand still grasped  the Gekkaja. This sphere disappeared in  a flash of light, taking the two martial artists with it.</p><p>On the ground, Mousse, Shampoo, Ryoga, and the people of Phoenix Mountain could only stare in shock. Saffron was dead, and there was no egg for  him to be reborn in. Ranma and Akane  disappeared, and like Saffron they were presumed dead. The people of Phoenix Mountain  returned to their home in defeat. The  Nerimans sighed as they realized now there was no reason for them to fight  anymore, and there now would be no way to cure their curses. They decided to head back. The whole while Genma was whining about what  a useless son he has to go and disappear like that. (After Shampoo freed him from the Sukiomi  Egg, of course)</p><p>When they arrived in Nerima, they came with their heads hung  low. Everyone in Nerima was told the  news: Ranma and Akane were dead. Kuno  was gloating about the defeat of the "Foul Sorcerer", but he was mourning the  loss of his "Pigtailed Goddess" and his "Fierce Tigress Akane." He was quickly silenced by his sister, along  with the remains of the Wrecking Crew.  The only real plus side to their return was that Happosai was nowhere to  be found. A few months later there was  the arrival of the Oni named Lum in the nearby district of Tomobiki, but that  is a story for another time.</p><p>Eventually, all in Nerima stopped grieving and moved  on. Ryoga ended up marrying Akari  Unryuu, and he raised pigs and taught martial arts the rest of his life. Ukyou and Konatsu married, and they had  several adventures of their own. Shampoo  and Mousse returned to China,  after a bit it was found out that they were married and had two children. Kodachi met a person who she liked better  than Ranma: Ryuu Kumon. Doctor Tofu returned to Nerima and made Kasumi a happy  woman. By the time Nabiki was ready to get married herself, she decided to fund  a research expedition to Antarctica.</p><p>The Second Impact happened, and Nerima was destroyed. The events of the Anime Neon Genesis  Evangelion happened as they did and the Third Impact ended the Age. The Wheel turns and time passes. The next Age brought the beginnings of the  channelers. Humans became able to use  the One Power in the masses. It would turn out that men and women could use  different parts of the Power. The male  half of the Power was given the name <i>saidin</i>,  and the female half, <i>saidar</i>. They developed means of travel that used  stones that they called "Portal Stones."  These stones would bring a person anywhere in the multiverse, provided  they knew the proper symbol. As this Age  faded, more and more things began to be developed with the Power. This gave birth to the Age of Legends and a  group of channelers decided to call themselves "Aes Sedai." The term "Aes Sedai" means servant to  all. That is exactly what these  channelers did. They were the healers,  the architects, the crafters, and the smiths.  With their base at the Hall of Servants, they used their ability to  channel to create a utopian society.  Another race developed, a nonhuman race known as the Ogier. The Ogier were great builders and workers  with stone. Teaming up with the Aes  Sedai, they built monumental cities.</p><p>As with all such societies, the Age of Legends began to  crumble with the discovery of a power similar to the One Power, but both men  and women could wield it. An expedition  of thirteen Aes Sedai was sent to find this power. What they found was the Dark One. Those thirteen became the Forsaken, though  they called themselves "Chosen". With the discovery of the Dark One came the  War of the Shadow. On one side were  those who chose to follow the Dark One, along with their creations: the  Trollocs and the Myrdraal, and on the other were those who followed the  Light. A hero rose up in the form of an  Aes Sedai named Lews Therin Telamon.  Lews Therin was named Dragon because of the way he commanded the people  under him. The Dragon had an army known  as the Hundred Companions. In the final  moments of the War of Shadow, Lews Therin led an attack with his Hundred  Companions on Shayol Ghul where they sealed up the hole on the Lord of the Night's  prison with seven seals. They put his "Chosen" in with him.  The Dark One retaliated by placing a taint on <i>Saidin</i>. The taint caused all  male channelers to eventually go mad and die.  Because of the sheer amount of male channelers and their power, the male  Aes Sedai began what is known as the Breaking of the World. The Dragon killed his family in his madness  and was named Lews Therin Kinslayer because of it. A person wrote a book of prophecies, <i>The Kaerthon Cycle</i>, or The Prophecies of  the Dragon. These Prophecies speak of  his return.</p><p>The world was reshaped.  Where once there was ocean, there was now land. Where once there were plains, there were now  mountains. When the Breaking finished so  did the Age of Legends, and the age known as the Third Age began. People once again had to find their culture  and each other. A new language was  developed from the language spoken in the Age of Legends. This language, known to gleemen as the Plain  Chant, was universal save for accents and slang. Artur Hawking had a dream to unite the Ten  Nations, and he started a war of conquering over it. The war was finished when the High King was  dead. At one point after that, the Aiel  gave a gift to Cairhien, <i>Avendoraldera,</i>  an offshoot of the Tree of Life; this was a sign of peace and that they would  trade with them. However, one king of  Cairhien, King Laman, ended that peace by cutting down the tree to make his  throne. This started the Aiel War. After the Aiel killed Laman, they returned  to the Waste, east of the Spine of the World. Where are Ranma and Akane? Are they truly dead?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the realm of the Eelfinn, a sphere with a  fox-head marking on it appears and lands in the center of a room holding nine  fox creatures. Four of them female, and  the rest male. The sphere faded away to  reveal an unconscious Ranma Saotome, still the same age as when he fought  Saffron, holding the Gekkaja, along with the Akane-doll. The foxes looked over the two bodies. One of the females shook her head as she  glanced over the two. The other foxes  seemed to be a bit afraid of her.</p><p>"Saotome… What have you and my younger sister gotten into  this time? Well, can't have my sister  like this." The fox waved her hand and  Akane returned to her normal size, breathing normally, remaining  unconscious. Akane was also fully  clothed in one of her normal yellow dresses.  "Now this weapon… I think you'd do better with a katana, wouldn't you  Saotome?" Not expecting an answer she  touched the Gekkaja and its tip straightened and lengthened as the base  contracted. Along the blade of the  Gekkaja-katana was an engraving of a Dragon, a Tiger and a Phoenix in movement down the blade. On the pommel of it was a marking of a fox  with two initials in the bottom right corner of it. NT. Engraved on the hilt, perhaps circling it was  what is known as the Great Serpent of the Wheel of Time, a snake-like creature  that apparently is eating its own tale.  The scabbard had two things engraved upon it, one was Gekkaja in Kanji, and  the other was <i>Caradier</i>, meaning Ice  Sword in the Old Tongue. "Perhaps you should also know the language as well."  She passed her hand over each of their heads before glancing at the remaining  Eelfinn in the room.</p><p>"Let's send them now to where they need to be. They will return to our realm in time,  remember they are ours to do with what we will.  We will follow the Pattern. My  little sister and her fiancée are needed to fulfill prophecy, and so they  shall."</p><p>There was another flash of light and the two unconscious  bodies were gone. A tear could be seen  running down the face of the Eelfinn female as she watched them go. "Good luck Ranma, and Akane. You both will need it."</p><p>End Prologue</p><p>A. N. Yes, it is shorter than my original prologue, but I  still think it's pretty good. It  definitely is better than my original one.  I can actually take this prologue and make something of it. I will be working on this fanfic along with  my other two at the same time. This is  my Epic Fic. It will have several books  as Ranma and Akane find their place in the series of Wheel of Time. Remember, all of their friends are dead, but  that doesn't mean that they weren't reborn.  After all, the Wheel Turns and Ages come and go. People are reincarnated. I will give only one hint in this part. BirgitteUkyo. Oh, and this is just a prologue guys, the  actual chapters will be longer.</p><p>Remember people, read and review. I can be contacted at
