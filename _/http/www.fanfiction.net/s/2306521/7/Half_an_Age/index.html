</div><p>Fearfully, Rand looked around as he dragged his feverish father towards town.  He needed to get out of the Westwood. The red-headed lad continued onwards, ever glancing back and forth. The Trollocs had attacked the farm a short while after he and Tam had gotten back there. He worried that they were still around and looking for him. That one Trolloc said something about a Myrddraal looking for him, wanting to speak to him. Light! A Myrddraal! This was like something out of a gleeman's tale, but unlike any brave adventurer, he could feel his fear creeping up through him. He hoped that he would reach the town soon.</p><p></p><p>Half An Age Book One: The Wild Horse Cometh</p><p>By Ellf</p><p>Chapter 4: Out of the Two Rivers</p><p></p><p>Disclaimer: Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi and is published in the United States by Viz. The Wheel of Time series, Randland and all of those characters belong to Robert Jordan's estate, and the series is published by Tor books. (Mostly) All other characters and series mentioned belong to their respective authors.</p><p>The attack on Emond's Field ended almost as abruptly as it started, but the damage done to the town was substantial. Reports had come in about the Cauthon farm being burned to the ground, and luckily the entire family had been in town for a Bel Tine that looked as if it would not be happening. After a Trolloc attack, the mood just left the town.  Other places were burned as well, the Luhan forge, the Aybara house, and a few other homes all had fire damage. Luckily due to the interference of an Aes Sedai, her Warder, and two Outlander teens, there were no casualties other than the invading Trollocs whose bodies now littered the town streets. The men of the town brought out carts and, under the direction of Moiraine Sedai, began loading the bodies of the Shadowspawn onto the carts so they could be burned in an area where the smell would not waft through Emond's Field in its entirety.</p><p>Ranma grunted as he loaded the latest Trolloc body onto the cart near him.  Glaring over at Akane he grumbled out, "You could help me, you know."</p><p>A village woman near Akane responded before Akane could. "Why should she help you? What you're doing is men's work. Don't worry about her, we'll make sure that she's all right."</p><p>"Seems good enough for <i>her</i>."  Ranma muttered under his breath as he hefted yet another Trolloc body onto the cart. The her in question was, of course Moiraine Sedai who was pointing out where the Trollocs should be burned and what manner to do it in to the aptly listening villagers. Ranma followed the cart as the horse up front dragged it along. He mulled the night itself over in his thoughts, barely noticing the directions he walked. Unbeknownst to him, the villagers gave Ranma a bit of a wide berth, and even the villager that led the horse in front of the cart seemed to want nothing to do with the pigtailed boy. This suited Ranma just fine as his musing continued.</p><p>Moiraine gave the orders to burn the Trollocs, expecting them to be followed, but her attention wasn't on the task at hand. As Lan went through the bodies identifying their origins, she focused on the enigma that was Ranma Saotome. How did he fit into the plans that brought her here in the first place? His abilities were not channeling insofar as she could tell, but it was always best to make sure of these things. If it wasn't channeling, then what was it? Walking over to the boy she embraced <i>saidar</i>, ready to weave if the need called for it.</p><p>"Young man, I would have a word with you."</p><p>At the sound of the Aes Sedai's voice, Ranma turned his head in her direction. "What do you want to talk about?"</p><p>Moiraine led him away from the burning Trolloc bodies to where they would not be overheard. "Ranma, tell me what you know about the One Power."</p><p>Ranma's brow furrowed in thought. "Well... I don't know much, but I remember the villagers saying something about men not being able to use it without going mad. Women can use it. Something about Eesu Seidai."</p><p>"Aes Sedai, Ranma, is what we are called. I am an Aes Sedai." Moiraine neglected to finish that statement as it was unnecessary because neither Ranma nor Akane knew much. "And the One Power is divided into two sides, one for men, <i>saidin, </i>one for women, <i>saidar</i>.  The reason men cannot use <i>saidin</i> is because it is tainted by the Dark One. The taint drives them mad."</p><p>"And what does this have to do with me?" Ranma seemed genuinely interested, but a little perturbed.</p><p>"During the fight against those Shadowspawn, you cut off a Trolloc's arm with <i>something</i>, and then there was the fireball you used on the Myrddraal."  Moiraine's voice showed no emotion.</p><p>"That wasn't a fireball. It was a Mokou Takabisha. My Ki blast."</p><p>"Ki?  I'm afraid that I don't recognize the word." The Aes Sedai's interest peaked.</p><p>"Ki is.. uh..." Ranma scratched at the base of his pigtail. "Ki is life energy. Everything has it."</p><p>Moiraine nodded, accepting the definition of the foreign word. "I see... and you are able to manipulate this... Ki?" She rolled the unfamiliar word around in her mouth.</p><p>Ranma nodded and smirked. "I can. The tomboy can too, but not as good as me."</p><p>"Could you possibly demonstrate this for me so that I can get a comparison?"  The boy seemed a little surprised at that. Interesting, and was that confidence on his face? Moiraine motioned for Lan to come over, just in case. She also weaved a Shield around the boy... which stuck there as if it were blocking <i>something</i>, but if Ranma knew it was there, he gave no indication of it.</p><p>"Sure, no problem." Ranma closed his eyes and put himself in what looked to be a boasting position. He then cupped his hands in front of him, facing upwards. Moiraine gasped as she saw the boy start to glow with a power. This power felt similar to s<i>aidar, </i>yet it most definitely was different. She had never seen anything like this before.</p><p>"I see it too, Moiraine." That confirmed that it was not <i>saidin</i>, Moiraine knew that Lan could not channel, and it also confirmed that the boy was not channeling when he did this, as the Shield did nothing to block it.</p><p>"Thank you, Ranma. That was similar to channeling, but it was not it."  Moiraine smiled. "This was very educational. Please return to helping the villagers. I must return to helping some of the injured."</p><p>000000000000000000</p><p>Ranma mulled over his conversation with Moiraine most of the rest of the night, and as dawn started to break, he brought one last load of Trollocs over to the Aes Sedai and her Warder.</p><p>Lan checked over the arm-band of the Trolloc that he laid down before him. "Ko'bal. That makes seven bands so far."</p><p>Ranma raised his eyebrow at that. "Seven bands, is that a lot?"</p><p>"Yes, boy, it is quite a bit. Nearly an entire fist. How they managed to get here is beyond me." Lan's stony face gave nothing away, but Moiraine's tone from ten feet away did.</p><p>"Seven bands, seven. How could we have missed this, Lan? This many Trollocs have not worked together since the Trolloc wars. Not this far south of the Blight. This is simply bad news. We should have gained some time by coming here. I <i>thought</i> we gained a march by coming here, but we may be further behind than ever"</p><p>Ranma stared. Moiraine looked far more weary than when he last spoke with her. Bits of hay stuck out of her hair, and she seemed very physically tired. "Hey, Moiraine-san, what am I, chopped liver?  It could have been worse."</p><p>"Right, let us not forget the Fade attack, boy." Lan's lips twitched at that. "You did well to hold your own against it. Not many men can say they fought a Myrddraal and lived."</p><p>"Still, this does worry me. This many Trollocs, this far south. How could we have missed this? How could anyone have missed it?"</p><p>"Mistress Moiraine... I mean Moiraine Sedai?" The three of them turned to the source of the voice. There stood Rand al'Thor, panting and looking like he had a worse night than Ranma himself did. The look of worry on his face. Ranma felt his worry from where he was.</p><p>"A little more light in the darkness." Ranma barely heard the Aes Sedai's murmur. "Tell me, how are your dreams, Rand al'Thor?"</p><p>Ranma was tempted to tune this out, but Rand's response was a confused one.  "My dreams?"</p><p>"Hey, what about his dreams, I mean sure, a night like this could easily give a person who isn't me bad dreams, but Rand doesn't look like he's slept."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"It... There's nothing wrong with my... It's my father. He's hurt, it's not more than a scratch, but the fever, it's burning him up."</p><p>"What happened to him, Rand?" Ranma worried. The man who helped them out was sick?</p><p>"One of the Trollocs, he cut him with his sword. I don't understand how a scratch could cause such a fever."  Rand turned towards Moiraine. "I... ah... it's said that Aes Sedai can heal. If you can help him... anything you can do for him... I'll pay any cost... no matter what it is." The red-haired young man drew in a deep breath. "I'll pay any price in my power if you can help him. Anything."</p><p>Ranma stared... Moiraine did say that she was going to help the injured.  He felt like he should be somewhere else, but both the older boy and the Aes Sedai looked like they were dead on their feet.</p><p>Ranma must have missed a response because he heard the Warder say, "Death comes sooner or later to everyone, unless they serve the Dark One, and only fools are willing to pay that price."</p><p>Moiraine made a clucking sound with her tongue that actually drew Ranma out of his reverie. "Do not be so gloomy, Lan. We do have some reason to celebrate, it is a small one, but one nonetheless. Master Saotome, if you don't mind, could you help me up? I find myself in a position that is rather hard to get out of."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Sure thing, Moiraine-san." He walked over to where she was and pulled her to her feet, and in an instant, Lan was next to her, holding the Aes Sedai's staff for her to lean on.</p><p>"Now then, take me to your father, Rand. I will help him as much as I am able to. Too many people refused my help here, and even refused young Ranma's. They heard the same stories you did."</p><p>Ranma gauged Rand's reaction to people refusing help, but it seemed that Rand was more worried about his father than paying attention to those parts of the words.</p><p>"Please, he's at the inn." Rand said. "And thank you. Thank you!"</p><p>Ranma paced himself with the Warder and Aes Sedai as they followed Rand, but Rand darted ahead, obviously impatient to get back to his father.  His pace slowed down as he waited for the three to catch up, and he darted ahead again.</p><p>On the third time he commented, "Please hurry."</p><p>"Look Rand, I understand that you're worried about your pop and all, but Moiraine seems kind of tired."</p><p>"Yes, sheepherder, even with an <i>angreal, </i> what she did last night was like running around the village with a sack of stones on your back. I'm not even sure you're worth it, no matter what she says."</p><p>Ranma bit back his comment about his father's training at this point in time. It would be inappropriate.. and he was tired too. He had been up for nearly twenty-four hours and the day before that he had been fighting for his and Akane's life, much like the previous night. He felt like he could just collapse on a futon and fall asleep for days.</p><p>Whatever Moiraine said to the boy it seemed to work as Rand was now walking at a sedate pace. He'd quieted down too. This suited Ranma just fine as he had his own moral dilemma to work out here. Was killing those creatures wrong, or was it the right thing to do because it saved people?</p><p>Ranma's contemplation continued until they reached the doors of the Winespring Inn. Rand hurried inside, his eagerness to see his father outweighing his fear of the Warder. Rand sped to a room that connected to the common room itself.</p><p>Upon reaching the room that Rand led them to, Ranma gasped at the state Tam was in. The man who had been so kind to him and Akane laid in the bed in front of him, obviously feverish and with his eyes shut.  Tam's breaths came out as labored gasps, very low, very raspy. The mayor leaned over the man, tending to him as Ranma helped Moiraine in. It was obvious that he was in a conversation with the gleeman, who was only about five feet away. He favored Moiraine with an uneasy look, and gave a relieved look to Ranma.</p><p>Thom put an unlit pipe into his mouth before taking it out quickly. Ranma shook his head as he heard the gleeman's words "Man can't even smoke in peace. I had best make sure some farmer doesn't steal my cloak to keep his cow warm. At least I can smoke out there." The man quickly left the room and Ranma glanced back down.</p><p>"How is he, Master al'Vere?" Ranma looked down at Tam, ignoring Lan's statement of mistrust against the gleeman, and the mayor's reply.</p><p>"He's not any better than what I can tell... <i>She</i> might be able to tell you more about his condition."</p><p>At that Rand stated, "My father?" Imploring Moiraine's attention to him.</p><p>Before the mayor could speak again, Moiraine spoke. "Leave me with him, Master al'Vere. There is nothing you can do here now except get in my way."</p><p>Bran's face slightly reddened at that statement, and he glanced between the door and the Aes Sedai. Apparently coming to a decision, he clapped both Ranma and Rand on the shoulder. "Come along boys. Let us leave Moiraine Sedai to her . . . ah . . . her . . . There's plenty you can give me a hand with downstairs. Before you know it Tam will be shouting for his pipe and a mug of ale."</p><p>Rand turned towards Moiraine after that. "Can I stay? Please? I'll stay out of your way, I just want to see my father all right. You won't even know I'm here... Please... he's my father."</p><p>Bran snorted out in worry at that, not even waiting for the Aes Sedai's reply before turning to Ranma. "Come on, lad. I still need to show you to your room. Your friend is sleeping soundly in hers."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "The tomboy's already asleep? Good for her."</p><p>Ranma followed the mayor out of the room and up some stairs. Bran led him to an inn room that was obviously unoccupied.</p><p>"This night's not been kind to us, but we Two Rivers folk are made of stern stuff. I suspect that I'll need to ask your friend to share a room with my Egwene tonight, if you are planning on staying longer. A few people will need rooms to stay in after an attack like that."</p><p>"I'm sure the tomboy'll understand, Master al'Vere. She may be stubborn, but she has a good heart on her. Probably too good for her own good a times." Ranma muttered something about crazy princes under his breath.</p><p>Bran raised an eyebrow at that. "At any rate, get some sleep, lad. I thank you a lot for helping to keep this town standing... Regardless of what you can do."  He walked away down the hall, leaving Ranma at the room entryway.</p><p>Shrugging at Bran's statement, Ranma yawned. He was tired, after all. The night had taken its toll on him. For all he knew it could have been one really strange dream brought on from fighting Saffron. Still... Ranma shuddered again at the memory of the Trollocs and their leader.  The creatures were most definitely demons, and it was a martial artist's duty to destroy them.</p><p>Ranma looked around the room and saw a simple bed, a dresser, a chamberpot and a side table.   He laid his sword down next to the bed. It still amazed him that the Gekkaja turned into such a weapon. Taking off his overshirt and his pants, Ranma folded them up neatly and placed them by his sword on the side table. He laid down in the bed and closed his eyes.  Softer than he was used to, but it worked... When he woke up he'd figure out... how... to...</p><p>0000000000000000000000</p><p>Blackness.  A splash of water. Bright light and a bald man standing above her, grabbing her arm and throwing her out the window into a koi pond.</p><p>"What'd ya do that for, pops?"</p><p>"Time to train, Ranma. You've been getting soft!"</p><p>Ranma leaped into action, exchanging blows with her father. He seemed slower than usual, and Ranma decided to taunt him for it.</p><p>"Hey old man, maybe I'm not the one getting soft, you can't seem to land a good blow today!"</p><p>"I'll show you who can't land a good blow, girl!" Their fight picked up in earnest, but Ranma couldn't seem to focus on it. Something kept drawing her attention, some source of serenity... and some source of something else. Still, the old man needed a dunking. She refused to be the only one with her curse activated this morning.</p><p>Ranma caught Genma with a hammer-arm blow that sent him careening into the pond. Genma took a bit longer to get out of the pond than usual, and Ranma landed on the pond's edge.</p><p>"Pop?"  Ranma asked, nervousness tinging her voice.</p><p>"Ranma-kun, Uncle Saotome! Breakfast time!" Standing at the entrance to the household was Kasumi, Akane's older sister. Dressed in her usual apron and conservative clothing, she had a large smile on her face.</p><p>Worry forgotten, Ranma started to head inside. <i>The Old Man can take care of himself.</i>  She approached Kasumi, or at least tried to. It seemed that each step she took towards the girl took her nowhere, further from the koi pond, but not closer to the house itself, and Kasumi... she just stood there waving at her.</p><p>"Breakfast time Ran-" There! Something interrupted Kasumi! Her face looked to be in pain. Sticking out of the front of her neck, where a man's Adam's Apple would be was a blade. The blade slowly carved its way down Kasumi's body like it were tissue paper... that dripped with blood. As her severed body fell forward, her lips managed to mouth out the last part of her statement, which should have been inaudible. "-ma-kun..."</p><p>Standing behind Kasumi's body was a horrific demon, half man, half beast. A panther-headed Trolloc that merely smiled at Ranma, who clenched up at the horror of what the creature had done... before turning tail and running towards the Koi pond.</p><p>Ranma wasn't looking where she... now he for some reason... was running...  and out of the koi pond burst an eyeless horror dressed in dark armor. It grasped him on the arm with its icy grip, locking its eyeless gaze onto Ranma's eyes.</p><p>"You can never win... boy."</p><p>Ranma heard a loud thumping noise in the background... and opened his eyes, breathing heavily.</p><p>00000000000000000000000</p><p>The thumping was coming from his door and continued for about five seconds before the door swung open. Standing at the door was Lan, the Warder, who looked him in the eye.</p><p>"Good.  You're awake." He tossed Ranma a bundle. "Put these clothes on and come downstairs. You'll be leaving with us, you and your girl."</p><p>Not even giving Ranma a chance to reply, the warder stalked out of the room, muttering something about crazy women and commenting on competency.</p><p>Ranma looked at the bundle in his hands. It was an outfit similar to what the warder wore underneath his cloak and armor, from what he could tell. A traveling outfit that would hopefully fit him. He put the outfit on quickly, and saw that it came with a backpack. Putting his old clothes into the backpack, and tying his sword at his waist, he appraised himself in front of the mirror that was in the room.</p><p>The clothes looked rather good on him, giving him a more rugged, manly look that made him smirk. Damn, he made these clothes look good.  Well... no time like the present to get moving, he could hear the crowd outside from here. They sounded angry for some reason.</p><p>Stepping out of the room, Ranma had to do a double take as he saw Akane dressed in a dress similar to that Egwene girl. It was a forest green dress that had a bit of a high neckline. Perfect for the weather the way it was. She looked beautiful in it, and Ranma smiled.</p><p>"How are you doing, Akane?"</p><p>Akane smiled at Ranma. "Pretty good, but I wonder why Moiraine-san was so eager to have us leave in a hurry."</p><p>"Can't you hear outside? Sounds like there's a riot out there. Might as well see what's going on." Ranma looked towards the stairs and started down them, gesturing for Akane to follow. He got to the common room of the inn and almost ran into Lan, Mat and Rand, who were peering through the front door of the inn.</p><p>The Warder motioned for the two of them to be quiet, and Ranma glanced outside to see a group of villagers wielding torches and various farming implements. He listened as they shouted at Bran, and as they shouted at Moiraine... and then she spoke up.</p><p>"Is this what Aemon's blood has come to?" Her voice was not loud, but it could be heard over every other sound. "Little people squabbling for the right to hide like rabbits? You have forgotten who you were, forgotten what you were, but I had hoped some small part was left, some memory in blood and bone. Some shred to steel you for the long night coming."</p><p>Bran said, "Forgotten who we were? We are who we always have been. Honest farmers and shepherds and craftsmen. Two Rivers folk."</p><p>"To the south," Moiraine said, "lies the river you call the White River, but far to the east of here men call it still by its rightful name. Manetherendrelle. In the Old Tongue, Waters of the Mountain Home. Sparkling waters that once coursed through a land of bravery and beauty. Two thousand years ago Manetherendrelle flowed by the walls of a mountain city so lovely to behold that Ogier stonemasons came to stare in wonder. Farms and villages covered this region, and that you call the Forest of Shadows, as well, and beyond. But all of those folk thought of themselves as the people of the Mountain Home, the people of Manetheren.</p><p>"Their King was Aemon al Caar al Thorin, Aemon son of Caar son of Thorin, and Eldrene ay Ellan ay Carlan was his Queen. Aemon, a man so fearless that the greatest compliment for courage any could give, even among his enemies, was to say a man had Aemon's heart. Eldrene, so beautiful that it was said the flowers bloomed to make her smile. Bravery and beauty and wisdom and a love that death could not sunder. Weep, if you have a heart, for the loss of them, for the loss of even their memory. Weep, for the loss of their blood."</p><p>She stopped speaking for a bit there, but no one else spoke. Ranma was as enraptured by the story as anyone else, and slowly moved towards the door so that he could hear better. When she spoke again, he took in the words as if his life depended on it.</p><p>"They were far away, the men of Manetheren, on the Field of Bekkar, called the Field of Blood, when news came that a Trolloc army was moving against their home. Too far to do else but wait to hear of their land's death, for the forces of the Dark One meant to make an end of them. Kill the mighty oak by hacking away its roots. Too far to do else but mourn. But they were the men of the Mountain Home.</p><p>"Without hesitation, without thought for the distance they must travel, they marched from the very field of victory, still covered in dust and sweat and blood. Day and night they marched, for they had seen the horror a Trolloc army left behind it, and no man of them could sleep while such a danger threatened Manetheren. They moved as if their feet had wings, marching further and faster than friends hoped or enemies feared they could. At any other day that march alone would have inspired songs. When the Dark One's. armies swooped down upon the lands of Manetheren, the men of the Mountain Home stood before it, with their backs to the Tarendrelle."</p><p>One of the villagers raised a cheer just then, but Moiraine continued on, as if it had not happened. "The host that faced the men of Manetheren was enough to daunt the bravest heart. Ravens blackened the sky; Trollocs blackened the land. Trollocs and their human allies. Trollocs and Darkfriends in tens of tens of thousands, and Dreadlords to command. At night their cookfires outnumbered the stars, and dawn revealed the banner of Ba'alzamon at their head. Ba'alzamon, Heart of the Dark. An ancient name for the Father of Lies. The Dark One could not have been free of his prison at Shayol Ghul, for if he had been, not all the forces of humankind together could have stood against him, but there was power there. Dreadlords, and some evil that made that light-destroying banner seem no more than right and sent a chill into the souls of the men who faced it.</p><p>"Yet, they knew what they must do. Their homeland lay just across the river. They must keep that host, and the power with it, from the Mountain Home. Aemon had sent out messengers. Aid was promised if they could hold for but three days at the Tarendrelle. Hold for three days against odds that should overwhelm them in the first hour. Yet somehow, through bloody assault and desperate defense, they held through an hour, and the second hour, and the third. For three days they fought, and though the land became a butcher's yard, no crossing of the Tarendrelle did they yield. By the third night no help had come, and no messengers, and they fought on alone. For six days. For nine. And on the tenth day Aemon knew the bitter taste of betrayal. No help was coming, and they could hold the river crossings no more."</p><p>"What did they do?" Ranma couldn't see the villager that asked that, and slowly opened the door to slip outside, unnoticed during the focus on Moiraine. The torches flickered outside.</p><p>"Aemon crossed the Tarendrelle," Moiraine stated, "destroying the bridges behind him. And he sent word throughout his land for the people to flee, for he knew the powers with the Trolloc horde would find a way to bring it across the river. Even as the word went out, the Trolloc crossing began, and the soldiers of Manetheren took up the fight again, to buy with their lives what hours they could for their people to escape. From the city of Manetheren, Eldrene organized the flight of her people into the deepest forests and the fastness of the mountains.</p><p>"But some did not flee. First in a trickle, then a river, then a flood, men went, not to safety, but to join the army fighting for their land. Shepherds with bows, and farmers with pitchforks, and woodsmen with axes. Women went, too, shouldering what weapons they could find and marching side by side with their men. No one made that journey who did not know they would never return. But it was their land. It had been their fathers', and it would be their children's, and they went to pay the price of it. Not a step of ground was given up until it was soaked in blood, but at the last the army of Manetheren was driven back, back to here, to this place you now call Emond's Field. And here the Trolloc hordes surrounded them." Her voice held the sound of cold tears. "Trolloc dead and the corpses of human renegades piled up in mounds, but always more scrambled over those charnel heaps in waves of death that had no end. There could be but one finish. No man or woman who had stood beneath the banner of the Red Eagle at that day's dawning still lived when night fell. The sword that could not be broken was shattered.</p><p>"In the Mountains of Mist, alone in the emptied city of Manetheren, Eldrene felt Aemon die, and her heart died with him. And where her heart had been was left only a thirst for vengeance, vengeance for her love, vengeance for her people and her land. Driven by grief she reached out to the True Source, and hurled the One Power at the Trolloc army. And there the Dreadlords died wherever they stood, whether in their secret councils or exhorting their soldiers. In the passing of a breath the Dreadlords and the generals of the Dark One's host burst into flame. Fire consumed their bodies, and terror consumed their just-victorious army.</p><p>"Now they ran like beasts before a wildfire in the forest, with no thought for anything but escape. North and south they fled. Thousands drowned attempting to cross the Tarendrelle without the aid of the Dreadlords, and at the Manetherendrelle they tore down the bridges in their fright at what might be following them. Where they found people, they slew and burned, but to flee was the need that gripped them. Until, at last, no one of them remained in the lands of Manetheren. They were dispersed like dust before the whirlwind. The final vengeance came more slowly, but it came, when they were hunted down by other peoples, by other armies in other lands. None was left alive of those who did murder at Aemon's Field.</p><p>"But the price was high for Manetheren. Eldrene had drawn to herself more of the One Power than any human could ever hope to wield unaided. As the enemy generals died, so did she die, and the fires that consumed her consumed the empty city of Manetheren, even the stones of it, down to the living rock of the mountains. Yet the people had been saved.</p><p>"Nothing was left of their farms, their villages, or their great city. Some would say there was nothing left for them, nothing but to flee to other lands, where they could begin anew. They did not say so. They had paid such a price in blood and hope for their land as had never been paid before, and now they were bound to that soil by ties stronger than steel. Other wars would wrack them in years to come, until at last their corner of the world was forgotten and at last they had forgotten wars and the ways of war. Never again did Manetheren rise. Its soaring spires and splashing fountains became as a dream that slowly faded from the minds of its people. But they, and their children, and their children's children, held the land that was theirs. They held it when the long centuries had washed the why of it from their memories. They held it until, today, there is you. Weep for Manetheren. Weep for what is lost forever."</p><p>Moiraine's staff lost its fire as it went out, and she lowered it. One of the farmers in the crowd turned towards her.</p><p>"I don't know about your story, but my Wil is walking because of you.  I'm ashamed to be here, I apologize for my statements, and I don't know if you can forgive me. Whether you want to stay or leave, you are welcome in Emond's Field as long as you like by my standards."  The farmer started to head back through the crowd... but then another person spoke up, inciting the crowd once more. They had noticed Ranma.</p><p>"Well, what about him! He's a male channeler! He'll go mad and kill us all!" An elderly man yelled out and pointed at Ranma. Cenn Buie, if Ranma remembered right. The crowd started to get noisy again.</p><p>Moiraine's mouth twitched. "And just how, exactly, do you know that he can channel?" Her voice was as level as it was when she told her story.</p><p>"We all saw it, what he was doing to the Trollocs, what he did to the Fade! He was glowing with power, he was!" Several villagers agreed with the man's statements.</p><p>"So what you're saying is that you could see an aura around him then, Master Buie?" Moiraine's voice sounded somewhat amused at this.</p><p>"Yes!  That's exactly what I'm saying!" The old man looked righteous at that moment. More around him chimed in at that moment saying that they could see the aura too.</p><p>"A little known fact to non-channelers is that only members of the same gender that can <i>also </i>channel can see the aura of Power around another channeler. For example, while I could see the fact that some of my Sisters can channel, those of you on the Women's Circle can not see my channeling. If what Ranma was doing was channeling <i>saidin</i>, then no one would see an aura around him that could not also channel <i>saidin</i>."</p><p>The elderly man looked a little frightened at that point, and the men around him paled. "But I saw it... and I'm no channeler!"</p><p>"Precisely, Master Buie. I saw it as well, and were it <i>saidin</i>, I would not be able to see it. What Ranma was doing was most definitely not channeling, but it was something else." Moiraine smiled.</p><p>"What was it then?" The old man could not let it go.</p><p>"That is something that I cannot tell you at this time." Moiraine stated simply.</p><p>"Besides, that boy, channeler or no... he saved my Erindel from the blazes.  Thank you, son. Thank you so much." The woman dragged her husband forward to shake Ranma's hand, and then dragged him away.</p><p>The crowd started to disperse, but a few people still refused to leave.  They had scowls on their sour faces, as if they had not gotten their way. Moiraine walked over to Ranma and motioned for him to follow her.</p><p>"Follow closely, Lan managed to secure some horses for you and Akane to come with us. I know that you likely had no plans to come with us, but Tar Valon is still your best chance at finding a way home."</p><p>Ranma had no objections to following the woman, especially after seeing her stunt with the fire on the staff. She seemed no worse for the wear, and a close inspection of the staff showed not even a touch of ash where the fire burned. He swore that while the staff was burning that he could see bits of red thread surrounding it, but that could have just been his eyes playing tricks on him in the night-time air.</p><p>They entered the inn, Akane standing in the common room waiting for Ranma.  Moiraine ducked away into a room.</p><p>"It's about time you got back in here. Honestly, you would think that you couldn't get through a day without angering someone." Akane said quietly.</p><p>"What would you know about it, you quick to anger tomboy?" Ranma retorted, a little louder.</p><p>"Simple, you make me angry easily, when you shoot off your mouth, baka."  Akane replied, a little louder.</p><p>"Who was shooting off their mouth? They just turned on me, baka."  Ranma said a little louder than that.</p><p>"Well if you hadn't been showing off..."</p><p>"Showing off!" Ranma was getting a little angrier.</p><p>"Children!"  Moiraine's stern tone silenced both martial artists, signifying her return. "We do not have time for the two of you to bicker as if you were still in swaddling clothes. Now come quickly, we must make for the stables." She swept off, and the two of them could see the change in her clothes instantly. She now wore a skirt divided for riding astride, much like Akane's own skirt, and the only gold that could be seen on her was the serpent ring on her finger. Even dressed like that, she still managed to seem regal, but less so.</p><p>The three of them headed out towards the stables, quietly, and they could hear sound from inside as they approached.</p><p>"My father believes her. At least, he agreed that we had to go."  Rand's voice was heard clearly at that point.</p><p>"Rand's coming with us?" Ranma turned towards the Aes Sedai, but she ignored him and quickly walked to the doorway of the stable.</p><p>"You talked to your rather about this journey?" Moiraine's voice was sharp as she spoke. Ranma and Akane filed in after her, noticing Lan working on bridling the horses and making sure the saddles were upon them. Mat, Perrin and Rand looked nervous, the larger boy with an axe hooked around his waist, the smaller had a strung longbow on his back. Rand himself wore a rather visible sword that had a western hilt, but a katana shape. Ranma found that odd.</p><p>"I couldn't go off without letting him know." Ranma looked to Rand when the older boy said that. He seemed determined.</p><p>Moiraine pursed her lips and looked at the other two. "Did you two also decide that a note wasn't enough?" Both boys shook their heads.  "I know that Ranma and Akane had no one to tell about their leaving. No matter, what's done is already woven in the Pattern.  Lan?"</p><p>"The horses are ready." The Warder replied. "And we have enough provisions to reach Baerlon and a little extra, if need be. I managed to buy two strong horses off of the family the boy here managed to save the child of. We can leave any time, I suggest that time be now."</p><p>"What's the hurry? You've been dragging us this way and that without any explanation. I think we deserve one." Ranma stated.</p><p>Moiraine glanced at the boy. "I can not explain it to you now, but know that us hurrying to leave is of utmost importance. We should leave now, as Lan said."</p><p>"Not without me." Egwene said as she slipped into the stable. She carried a shawl wrapped bundle in her hands, and the hood of her dark blue cloak was up.</p><p>Ranma tensed until he saw who it was, and he noted the Warder sliding his sword back into its sheath. The girl turned towards Moiraine, almost daring her to tell her no as she said, "I have everything I need for this trip, including food. I absolutely refuse to be left behind. I've never been outside the Two Rivers. I've never even been past Westwood and I will not pass up this chance."</p><p>"This isn't a picnic to the Waterwood, Egwene." Mat said with a growl.</p><p>"Why thank you, Matrim, I'd never have known had you not told me. Do you think you three are the only ones who want to see outside? The only ones who have dreamed about it? I've dreamed about it nearly as long as the three of you have, and I intend on seeing it."</p><p>Ranma tuned out the rest of the argument, knowing somehow the girl was going to come with them. He knew too much about stubborn women from dealing with his fiancées, and since the girl's ire was not directed at him, he refused to let it bother him. Looking at the Warder, he noted that the man was nowhere near as emotionless as he made himself seem. This was even more apparent with the warder's outburst.</p><p>"No, Moiraine!"</p><p>"It's part of the pattern now, Lan."</p><p>"It is ridiculous! There's no reason for her to come with us!" Lan's said, his voice tinged with confusion and anger.</p><p>"There is a reason for it," Moiraine calmly replied. "A part of the pattern, Lan." The man nodded slowly at that, his face betraying no emotion. It seemed like he used the Soul of Ice to Ranma, but he detected no chill ki from the man.</p><p>"But, Egwene," Rand said, "the Trollocs will be chasing us. We won't be safe until we get to Tar Valon."</p><p>"Don't try to scare me off, Rand al'Thor. I will be coming along on this trip whether you like it or not." Egwene's tone brooked no nonsense. Ranma opened his mouth as if to say something and suddenly got elbowed by Akane.</p><p>"Stay out of it, Ranma." Akane hissed. "If I'm coming, she can come."</p><p>"She's not even a martial artist... and those creatures, if they're chasing those boys. It's a martial artist's duty to protect the weak."</p><p>"I'm a martial artist too. We'll protect her, make sure she's safe."  Akane said in his ear.</p><p>Ranma hung his head in defeat and nodded. "What horse is she going to ride then?" His voice came out louder than he intended.</p><p>"She can ride the gleeman's horse." The Warder replied. "I'll leave him enough money to buy another one."</p><p>"I'm afraid that won't be possible." The gleeman's voice rang out from the hayloft. An audible "SHING" echoed through the stable. The Warder held his sword completely out of its sheath and aimed it at the Gleeman.</p><p>Thom tossed down a bedroll from the hayloft, then slung his flute, in its case, of course, and harp on his back. On his shoulders lay bulging saddlebags. He hopped down from the hayloft nimbly.</p><p>"This village has no use for me, now, while on the other hand, have never performed in Tar Valon. And though I usually journey alone, after last night I have no objections at all to traveling in company."</p><p>Ranma appraised the man, whom he hadn't even noticed was there, almost missing Perrin's statement about not checking the loft.</p><p>"You sure you want to come with us, Master Merrilin?"</p><p>"Just Thom, lad. I have never played in Tar Valon before, and a little adventure will add to my stories, eh?" The Gleeman started saddling up his horse.</p><p>"Master Merrilin," Moiraine said. "we must go quickly, and almost certainly in great danger. The Trollocs are still out there, and we go by night. Are you sure that you want to travel with us?"</p><p>"If it is not too dangerous for the girl, it is not too dangerous for me.  Besides, what gleeman would not risk a little danger to perform in Tar Valon?"</p><p>Moiraine nodded as her Warder put his sword back in its scabbard.</p><p>"That still begs the question of what the girl will ride." Moiraine said.</p><p>"The peddler's horses are as bad as the Dhurrans," the Warder sourly replied. "Strong, but slow plodders. Definitely not what we need from a horse."</p><p>"Bela," Rand's voice came out. Ranma recalled Bela from the previous morning, the horse that Tam and Rand took their cider to the inn with. "She may not be as fast as the others, but she's strong. I ride her sometimes, she can keep up."</p><p>"She will have to do. Go get the tack and saddle her up." Lan said to Rand who quickly hurried off. He then turned towards the two martial artists. "Boy, girl. These are your horses. Fireball and Star.  I hope the two of you have riding experience. The rest of you, get on your horses, we leave as soon as Rand finishes saddling Bela."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Well... we have good enough balance, this should not be too hard." Ranma straddled Fireball's saddle, the mare letting out a snort as he got on. "Easy girl... We need to work together."</p><p>The mare seemed soothed by that, and he looked over to Akane who seemed to be having an easier time with Star. He raised an eyebrow at that, and she smiled at him. "Daddy took my sisters and I to a riding ranch once when we were younger. I guess I remember a bit of it."</p><p>Ranma nodded. It was a good thing that she would be fine on the horse.  "Just be careful, Akane."</p><p>Rand returned a short while later and helped Egwene on to Bela. He saw that all other horses were taken save one and sighed. He got on the stallion and soothed him quickly.</p><p>An owl hooted in the night air, causing everyone to jump in their saddles.</p><p>.</p><p>"Next we'll be jumping at field mice." Egwene managed to say with a wary chuckle. "Or a cat will chase us up a tree."</p><p>Ranma winced at that one as Lan shook his head. "Better if it had been wolves."</p><p>"Why wolves, Lan-san?" Akane asked curiously, eying Ranma at the same time.</p><p>Lan fixed her with a flat stare. "Wolves don't like Trollocs, girl, and Trollocs don't like wolves, or dogs either. If I had heard wolves out there I would know that there were no Trollocs waiting for us. That would be a wonderful comfort at this point." He then led his black horse out of the stable, followed quickly by Moiraine and Egwene who stuck close to the Aes Sedai.</p><p>Ranma and Akane rode out next, followed by Perrin and Mat, with the gleeman and Rand bringing up the rear. It was dark and silent in the back of the inn, and moon shadows spotted the yard. The clopping of the horse hooves quietly echoed through the yard. The Warder seemed to blend into the shadows in the night, and it was the fact that the group needed him to lead that they did not crowd around of him.</p><p>Ranma looked around the village. Most windows were lit, the villagers obviously did not want to be taken by surprise again. It would be difficult to sneak out of this village without any of them being seen by the people in the village at the very least.</p><p>They followed Lan through the inn yard, keeping to the shadows of the inn.  Ranma halted Fireball at the same time Lan halted his own horse.  The rest of the group halted a split-second later, and footsteps could be heard on the bridge that led to the inn. Ranma didn't know nor did he care the name of it.</p><p>The footsteps stopped just before the inn, just before the dim light from the windows that led to the common room could reach. A man stepped forward and Ranma let go a breath that he hadn't even realized he was holding in. He was fairly certain that the man was not Shadowspawn before, but it helped to have visual confirmation.</p><p>The man peered inside the common room of the inn, "All seems right here." He turned away and walked away with his partner.</p><p>"Two Dha'vol Trollocs would have them all for breakfast,"Lan muttered softly once the sound of the boots had disappeared, "but they have eyes and ears." Turning his stallion back he said, "Come."</p><p>He led the group back across the stableyard, down the bank through the willows and into the waters that gave the inn its name. Ranma eyed the water nervously and lifted his feet so that they would not even be splashed by the water. There was no way that he could allow himself to have the curse activated at this point.</p><p>After they had managed to come out on the far shore, the group of riders followed the Warder's deft directions to avoid the villager's houses, and, like before, both Ranma and Akane stopped at the same times that the Warder himself did. The rest of the group seemed confused by this, but each time the reason was revealed as another villager passed the way in front of them. The villagers of Emond's Field were taking no chances tonight, and Lan had to be extra careful in leading the group. Ranma appreciated the fact that neither he nor Akane were wearing the bright clothing that they had come to the village in.</p><p>Ranma looked around at the place that had been kind enough to take him and Akane in, if only for a day. Somehow he knew that he would one day see this place again, but it would not be for a long while. The tall houses that by his standards were not all that tall at all gave him a bit of warmth in his heart as he remembered his time with his father, and then a chill went down his spine as he remembered the dream he had when he slept. <i>One day, I'll see them again. I won't allow that to happen to them.</i></p><p>The group passed the last of the farmhouses that were at the outskirts of the village, and were now following along the countryside that ran parallel to the road that led to the next town. Ranma heard Moiraine mention a Taren Ferry to Lan, and he assumed that was the town's name. Looking up, he appreciated the night sky that one could not get in the city, and he tried to find a familiar constellation to see if he could figure out where he was. The deep black scattered with twinkling stars caught his heart, but he could not find any familiar constellations at all. Wait... did that one look a little like a warped Big Dipper? Right next to the silvery moon. It was there, but wait... what was that?</p><p>A large shadow crossed the moon in the night, and a dread chill came over Ranma's senses. Whatever the creature was it was no bat, far too big, almost man sized from the shadow it made and its distance.  Ranma looked around, it would seem that Rand noticed the creature too, and was describing it to Lan.</p><p>"Draghkar." The Warder growled out, as if it left a bad taste in his mouth. The Two Rivers folk all scanned the sky nervously, Akane as well, but the gleeman simply groaned.</p><p>"Yes." Moiraine said simply. "It is too much to hope for otherwise. If the Myrddraal has a Draghkar under its command, he will soon know where we are if he does not already. We must move more swiftly than before. Faster than we can by going cross-country. If we hurry, we may still make it to Taren Ferry before the Myrddraal and his Trollocs can. We will cross the Taren far easier than they."</p><p>"A Draghkar?" Egwene's voice was nervous. "What is it?"</p><p>Surprisingly it was not the Aes Sedai nor the Warder who answered, but rather the gleeman, Thom Merrilin. "In the war that ended the Age of Legends, worse beings than Trollocs and Halfmen were created."</p><p>This drew a sharp glare from Moiraine and before any could ask the gleeman more, Lan was already giving directions.</p><p>"We take the North Road now. For your lives, follow my lead and keep up.  We need to keep together in this."</p><p>Without another word, the Warder turned his horse about, and everyone else galloped after him. They were not far from the North Road and quickly reached it. Upon reaching it, Lan had them all increase their speed again, keeping an ever-watchful eye to the sky. Lan barked some orders out about order of riding and the duties of each rider to the rest of the group and they all galloped hard.</p><p>On the hard-packed dirt of the North Road, the entire line of horses was stretched out. Lan was in the lead, his cloak billowing in the wind like a dark shadow behind him. Ranma was in the middle of the group, just behind Akane, but in front of Perrin. He glanced behind him to see how Rand was doing in the rear. The older boy's job was to sound the alarm if he spotted any Trollocs, Myrddraal or a Draghkar. Ranma's job was to fall back if the alarm did sound.</p><p>Every few minutes he glanced back at the people behind him, making sure that they were keeping up okay, hoping that the Draghkar or any other beastie were not back there to deal with at the moment. Worse than Trollocs or Myrddraal, the gleeman had said. What exactly made them worse? Ranma's curiosity was piqued, and he desired to find answers.</p><p>Ranma leaned into Fireball's chestnut mane, as far down as to lower the wind resistance. While he could easily run this fast without the horse, he knew the necessity of using her. Overall she had not given him any problems tonight, easily keeping pace with the stallion of Lan's. She seemed to be content going at the speed she was at, but Ranma somehow knew she could go faster if necessary.</p><p>Ranma glanced once again at the group, especially at Akane. He knew that if Akane fell behind, despite his own objections, he would slow for her. Hell, despite Akane's own objections. He needed to keep her safe as she was the only piece of home that was left here with him.  Though Ranma felt that he would do the same for any of the members of the party. First and foremost he was a martial artist, and he would protect this party from the monsters.</p><p>On and on the group rode, and Ranma's perception of time seemed to fade away. All he could hear was the clip-clopping of hooves and the wind going past his head. Now and again, he could spot the light from various farmhouses that appeared along the way, but they passed quickly. Or he could possibly hear a dog barking, but this too passed quickly.</p><p>After an undetermined amount of time, Lan abruptly stopped the line of horses. Ranma was unsure as to how long they had been traveling, but he saw that the others, even Akane had started to develop aches related to the saddle from the way that they were adjusting their legs. He, however, was still good to go for at least another few hours. This was nothing compared to the dread Goldfish Bowl Hold training that his father put him through when he was seven. Heck, the horse was smaller than the bowl.</p><p>He rode over to Akane to see that she too had some aches from the saddle. "You okay, Akane?"</p><p>"I'm fine, Ranma. Just a little sore from riding so long." Ranma nodded at her reply. He was about to respond when the gleeman spoke up.</p><p>"Much as I would like to put all these villages behind me," Thom announced to the group. "a few hours rest would not go amiss right now. Surely we have enough of a lead to allow that?"</p><p>Ranma looked at the gleeman as the Two Rivers folk chimed in about going to the nearby town, which obviously was having some sort of celebration tonight, unmolested by the Trollocs that had attacked Emond's Field.  Judging from the time it was, they must have been finishing up their celebration of the Bel Tine festival that Rand had told them about the previous day. Had it really only been that long? It seemed like he had been here for weeks already, and on the road for half of them.</p><p>Ranma idly noted the Aes Sedai passing through the party, touching the horses and riders in turn. When she came upon him, he felt what little fatigue he had leave him, and he saw that the horse was also less tired. He could have sworn he saw a flash of gold along with a yellow and blue thread as she touched him, but he played it off as a trick of the light, or lack thereof.</p><p>"We must not stop until we are across the Taren." Lan stated, and Ranma privately agreed with him. He was certain that his horse was up for another few hours of hard riding now. Ranma walked over to the gleeman.</p><p>"So what exactly is a Draghkar, Thom-san?" Ranma asked curiously. "If we are being hunted by one, I would at least like to know what it is."</p><p>"A Shadowspawn that stories say can eat souls. It will lure you in with its song and then devour your soul, leaving your body a shell of its former self. At least, that's what the stories say, but I'm not eager to find out if they are true." The gleeman answered.  "Hopefully we are far enough ahead now that it won't find us."</p><p>A shrill cry tore through the black of night, sounding like a man being impaled upon multiple swords, and wings swooped down close to the party. The shadow over them deepened in the night and the horses reared wildly.</p><p>Ranma managed to keep a good hold on Fireball's reins, keeping her from running off as she bucked. He looked into the mare's frightened eyes and managed to soothe her by petting her mane. It was only then that Ranma looked around at the rest of the group. It seemed that not many fared better than he did, the lot of the Two Rivers folk busy grasping at reins, and Akane doing the same as he. Only two of the party seemed to be unaffected. Moiraine, who sat calmly on her white horse, and Lan, who stood next to his black stallion, scanning the air, sword drawn.</p><p>"Mount!" Lan ordered shortly. "The Draghkar would not have shown himself had he not already reported our whereabouts to the Myrddraal. Mount and let's ride!"</p><p>This was easier said than done, as the newly revitalized horses were skittish from the scream, and tried to back away. The gleeman was first on his horse, but Ranma and Akane were close behind, as were the rest of the group. Ranma looked to make certain that everyone was on their horse, and there was Rand, staring at the sky, waving his sword around. The idiot. Ranma rode over to him and in a feat of strength, lifted the larger boy off of the ground and placed him down on the saddle of his horse and then forced him to sheath the sword.</p><p>"Come on, Rand, we need to hurry!" Ranma yelled at the boy who reddened in response.</p><p>Once Rand was in the saddle they were off on a gallop again, up the road next to the dome-like hill that they had stopped near. Ranma could hear dogs barking in the village, perhaps at the cry, or perhaps they could smell Trollocs nearby and that was just a <i>lovely</i> thought. Both the lights from the village and the barking vanished swiftly behind them as they galloped.</p><p>Though the Warder ordered them to separate, he quickly gave up on the notion as the group rode clustered together. Moiraine, Lan and Rand took up the front, Ranma, Akane and Perrin in the middle, and Mat, Egwene and the gleeman were not too far behind them. A scream came from overhead and Ranma looked up to see the shadow of the creature not even fifty feet above them. If he could see it a little clearer, perhaps he could hit it with a ki blast... or a vacuum blade.  Unfortunately, it was swift in the air.</p><p>They galloped through a small bit of fog, no higher than the horses knees, and then another bit of it that was more. More and more mist was coming and Ranma glanced to the Aes Sedai, somehow knowing that this was her handiwork and thanking all the kami that it was only liquid water that caused him to change.</p><p>Soon, all the riders were enveloped in a cloud of fog that came and went, came and went, and overhead the Draghkar screamed with rage. Then a wall of fog appeared and Ranma could barely make out the shapes of Akane next to him and Rand ahead of him. As he felt the moistness on his skin, but the lack of tingle, he once again thanked the kami that it required liquid water to trigger the curse. He really did not want to be a girl at the moment.</p><p>"There is only one place we can be going," Lan's voice echoed out from the fog, obviously coming from ahead of him.</p><p>"Myrddraal are sly, and I will use its slyness against it." Moiraine's voice replied.</p><p>Mist now engulfed both sky and ground such that the riders all seemed to be but shadows within it, appearing to float through the clouds. It got to the point where the riders could not even see the legs of the horses that they were on.</p><p>Ranma looked around, still able to see Akane and Rand's outline, at least he hoped it was theirs. From Lan's encouragement he stayed within sight of the shadows, silently riding onward. The speed did not lessen, even in this mist, and as long as he kept pace with the shadows, he would not get lost.</p><p>The cries of the creature faded as they galloped onward, and soon were completely gone, giving small comfort to the group of riders. They still passed farmhouses and heard dogs barking along the way on the road. Ranma once again lost all sense of time as they rode. Only the slowly building cramp in his right hand gave any indication of its passing.</p><p>The moon was still high in the sky when Lan called out to the party "Slow. Draw rein." Ranma was honestly surprised at this and quickly slowed Fireball to a trot. He looked around and saw that there were houses taller than those in other villages. Perhaps they had reached their destination. He followed as the Warder led them through town to a house.</p><p>At this point, Lan dismounted along with Moiraine and he started pounding on the door's house. Ranma ignored the muttered comment from Mat as Lan continued pounding on the door.</p><p>About two minutes later, the door opened to reveal a man dressed in a nightshirt which flapped around his bare ankles, holding an oil lamp.  The lamp revealed the man's pointed features and angry scowl.  "What's this?" The man said, "What's this?"</p><p>"Master Hightower," Lan said curtly. "Just the man I need. We would like to cross over on your ferry."</p><p>Mat made some comment that had Rand make a loud shushing noise as the man spoke.</p><p>"The ferry goes over in daylight. Not in the night. Not ever. And not in this fog, neither. Come back when the sun's up and the fog's gone." The man started to turn away, but the warder caught his wrist. As the man's mouth was about to open up in anger, gold glittered in the lamplight as Lan counted out several pieces, placing them into the man's palm. Hightower licked his lips as if he could not believe the amount of gold he was being paid. Ranma in no way trusted this man.</p><p>"And as much again when we reach the other side. Tonight."</p><p>"Now it is then." Hightower responded. "Let loose my wrist so that I may rouse my haulers. You don't think that I pull the ferry across myself, do you?"</p><p>"I will wait by the ferry," Lan replied and let go of the man's wrist. "For a little while."</p><p>Hightower brought the handful of coins to his chest, and then shut the door with his hip quickly. Presumably he would be getting ready.</p><p>"Come now, I'll lead you all to the ferry." Lan led the party through the town, and they quickly reached the ferry dock. Ranma eyed the waters of the Taren warily, noting that he would stand close to the center of the ferry to avoid any unpleasantness. The river itself was fairly wide, and in the fog that engulfed the night, it was impossible to see the other side.</p><p>They waited for fifteen minutes before Lan put his hand on his sword's pommel, inspiring others to do similar acts. Ranma himself held his hand at the base of his sword's sheath, thumb under the hilt. The "Hsst" sound from Lan probably had something to do with it.</p><p>Hightower showed up with six stolid-faced men, all wielding torches. Soon the entire party was visible in the torchlight as they approached. The ferryman examined them all, like an animal looking for a trap.</p><p>All of the men took stances that showed off their weapons, but Lan, Ranma and Thom looked the most relaxed in doing so. A laugh came out from Moiraine, Egwene started clapping as if she were at a festival, and then she stopped but a smile twitched on her face regardless. Akane just held her face in her hands, and Ranma could swear that she muttered the word, "Men!"</p><p>The ferryman stared at Thom for a second, obviously unamused and it showed in his voice when he spoke. "There was mention made of more gold for the crossing." He gave them all a sly look. "What you gave me earlier is in a safe place already, hear? It's where none of you can get it."</p><p>"The rest of the gold, Master Hightower, will be given to you once we are all safe on the other side of the river." Lan replied, the leather purse on his waist giving a little clink when he shook it.</p><p>His eyes glanced once more to the party and then back to Lan's waist. He snorted. "Let us be about it then." He muttered, stalking onto the landing and directing his haulers onto the ferry. The fog burned around them as they moved, and grey tendrils filled in behind them.  Ranma quickly followed, taking Fireball with him.</p><p>The ferry itself was a simple wooden barge with high sides, boarded with a ramp that could be raised to block it off. A set of ropes ran alongside it, each thick as a man's wrist, each fastened into a wooden pole on the side of the river, and presumably the same on the other side.</p><p>The ferryman's helpers placed the torches they carried into iron holders on the ferry and lowered the ramp so that the party could get their horses aboard. Once all horses were aboard they drew the ramp, and the ferry shifted under the weight of the sixteen people and nine horses.</p><p>Hightower ordered the party to keep the horses still and to keep towards the center and out of the haulers' way. He then yelled at his helpers to hurry and get the ferry ready, but they moved fairly slow.</p><p>Finally they managed to get it ready and then Hightower ordered them to start the ferry's movement. The ferry lurched forward as the haulers started it moving. Soon the loading dock disappeared from sight, and Hightower moved to the front to peer at the fog ahead of the barge.</p><p>Ranma gazed at the sides of the barge, keeping a steady hand on Fireball as the boat started to move. He noticed that Lan and Rand were talking, about what he did not know. Akane and Egwene seemed to be talking to each other as well. Mat actually nudged him.</p><p>"Ranma," Mat started, "How exactly did you pick Rand up and put him on Cloud?"</p><p>Ranma blinked, his mind leaving the water for a second. "I'm just strong like that, Mat. I'm a martial artist, and we needed to move, so I placed him on his horse quicker than he'd be able to himself."</p><p>"Right, but how did you do it?" Mat questioned again.</p><p>"Shh..." Ranma stated quickly, and he strained his ears but heard nothing.  Especially not what he thought he heard. "Must have been my imagination."</p><p>Mat looked around fearfully. "What? What did you hear?"</p><p>"Nothing, apparently." Ranma looked around himself before he felt a slight lurch as a loud thump was heard. They had reached the other side of the river.</p><p>The ferryman's helpers hurried to lash the craft and lowered the ramp such that everyone could get off. Mat and Perrin quickly announced that the Taren was not as wide as they had heard while Lan led his stallion down the ramp. Ranma and the others quickly followed until they were safely on the shore. Once the last person reached the solid ground, Hightower called out angrily.</p><p>"Here now, where's my gold?"</p><p>"It shall be paid," Moiraine's voice was somewhere out there, "And a silver mark for each of your men for the safe passing."</p><p>Eager to get the gold, Hightower came off the ferry with his helpers who were eager for the tip. Hightower approached Lan who counted out the coins individually and placed the last coin in Hightower's hand.  The man eyed Lan's still full purse hungrily, and put the money he had gotten into his pockets.</p><p>From behind him, the landing lurched and then creaked. Points of light began to fade away as it quickly became obvious that-</p><p>"It's loose! The ferry's loose you fools! Get it! Get it!" Hightower was frantic.</p><p>The haulers quickly tried to chase after it before a swirling of air and water swallowed the landing and the ferry.</p><p>"Whirlpool."  One of the haulers said.</p><p>"There are no whirlpools on the Taren!" Hightower sharply replied before a shrill scream echoed through the air, frightening the horses.</p><p>"No... how did it find us again?" Moiraine asked. "It should not have been able to find us through the mist."</p><p>Wings swooped down as the creature landed where the landing once was.  Despite the fog, it could be seen clearly. It was roughly the size of a man, but its skin was far too pale and it had white bat-like wings.</p><p>"Why did it land?" Ranma asked, hoping for a reply.</p><p>He got one in the form of a strange song that came from the creature.  Its eyes locked with one of the haulers and the hauler started to slowly approach it.</p><p>"He is caught in the Draghkar's song!" Lan said drawing his sword.</p><p>"Take Fireball, and keep Akane safe!" Ranma called out to Lan. He then dashed towards the creature at a high speed, glowing with ki. "Run away while you can!"</p><p>Ranma passed the man caught by the Draghkar's song, and he tackled the Draghkar. His momentum carried both him and the shadowspawn into the Taren, where they both disappeared beneath its dark depths.</p><p>0000000000000000</p><p>(End Chapter)</p><p>Author's notes: Well, it's been nearly a year coming, but I finally decided to buckle down and seriously work on this chapter. Despite my April Fool's joke this year, I hope that I still have some decent fans left. Remember, please review. This fic will get finished, never think that it is abandoned. Thank you all, and thank you especially Louis Phillipe-Giroux for inspiring three scenes in this chapter.  (PS: I want more Differing Powers)</p><p>Another note: This chapter pulls much of its dialogue from canon scenes in Eye of the World. Though the dialogue is often adjusted or changed.</p>
