</div><p>My name is Ranma. Now you probably think my family name is Saotome, but I've got news for you. It ain't. Yes, I am that Ranma that you are thinking of, but Takahashi changed our last names to make them a bit more comedic. If you think I'm going to tell you my last name, you're wrong. It isn't safe. They are out there. For the sake of safely telling this story, my name will be Ranma Saotome, and the others will retain their Takahashi names, but remember, these ain't our real names. I won't tell you where we live either. Nerima will have to do for now.</p><p>There's a reason for all of this secrecy. It ain't because we don't want the attention. Well, at least that kind of attention. We don't want <i>them</i> to find us. Because if they did, all would be lost, and the Earth would lose its freedom.</p><p>There are days when I look back and remember a time when all I cared about was the Art. Well, the Art, and my cure. I remember that day when it happened. When it all changed for me; for me and for the rest of us. We were just kids back then.</p><p>Nerima Morphing Crew</p><p>An Animorphs/Ranma Nibunnoichi fusion By: Ellf</p><p>Disclaimer: Animorphs is owned by K. A. Applegate, and Scholastic publishing. Ranma 1/2 is owned by Rumiko Takahashi, Viz, Kitty Films, and Shokakugan Entertainment. There, the disclaimer thingy's out of the way. Now move before I send a league of Hork Bajir after you.</p><p>It was shortly after what had become known as the Failed Wedding incident. Akane and I getting married, well, Pop and Tendo-san can dream, can't they? It wasn't like I wanted to marry the uncute tomboy anyways. Anyways, I'm getting beside myself here, and forgot what I was writing about. I had to look back up at the beginning of the paragraph to figure out what exactly I was saying. Oh right, the failed wedding. After that, both Ukyo and Shampoo seemed to have doubled their efforts at chasing me, and Akane's temper seemed to... Well it wasn't exactly directed at me; she found a different punching bag this time around. Not that I can't take a hit from that tomboy, but I am happy she wasn't hitting me. You probably don't care who she was hitting anyways.</p><p>Anyways, the day that it happened, Akane and I decided we wanted to go to the mall. Actually, she decided and just dragged me along for carrying packages and stuff. We were actually having a good time.</p><p>I suddenly froze as I heard the ringing of a bicycle. That could only mean one thing. Shampoo. Don't know why she always does it, but somehow she managed to lodge the bicycle into my skull.</p><p>"Airen!" She glanced around from atop her bike on my head. "Where is Airen?"</p><p>I'm below the bike, baka. But I didn't say it like that. "D-down here..."</p><p>"Airen!" She glomped me, just like usual. Making sure to rub herself against me. Don't get me wrong, Shampoo's a pretty cute chick, but she always makes me uncomfortable when she's doing that, no matter what form she's in. That particular day, someone else happened to show up.</p><p>"Ranma! I shall</p><p>Lying on the floor of an unidentifiable altar area was a corpse dressed in rusted Roman Centurion armor. Beside it lay a staff apparently made of bone. A green light began to float around the room, originating from the arch of the altar. The green light pulsed and two voices could be heard. The first was female in sound, and the second, well the second was a whisper.</p><p>"So, here you have fallen, my servant…"</p><p>"<i>He has failed me, has been defeated by the human, and has caused me to be sealed once more."</i></p><p>"And yet, he is needed, my avatar must be working his hand in the world…"</p><p>"<i>Needed to sow the seeds of chaos, despair and suffering, needed to help me prevail."</i></p><p>"To help me regain my strength…"</p><p>"<i>Which I have lost to Ulyaoth…"</i></p><p>"To help me regain my life…"</p><p>"<i>Which was taken by Mantorok…"</i></p><p>"To help me regain my power…"</p><p>"<i>Which was eliminated by Chatturgha…"</i></p><p>"He is needed…"</p><p>"<i>Yes, needed…"</i></p><p>"Arise, my servant…"</p><p>"<i>Arise… Pious Augustus…"</i></p><p>The green light went into the corpse, animating it on contact. A green arc of electricity seemed to travel up and down the body and caused it to twitch. And <b>SUDDENLY</b> it sat up! It reached its bony fingers towards the staff and used it to stand up. As his face could be seen, the eyes began to spark green.</p><p>"I await my orders, Mistress." came from the once more Lich.</p><p>"You know what you must do Augustus…"</p><p>"<i>Bring me back!"</i></p><p>A fanfic based upon the original characters created by Silicon Knights and Rumiko Takahashi.</p><p>Written by Peter Gallagher (Ellf)</p><p>Eternal Darkness: Sanity Halved</p><p>"I had met the mother of my daughter on one of my trips to Japan. It was an innocent fling, but when she called me in Rhode Island nine months later, I found out that I had another child. The child's name was Nodoka Saotome; she had taken her mother's last name. I lost contact with her mother shortly afterwards, knowing only that I had a child. It wasn't until Nodoka had reached age eighteen when I heard from my daughter again. I traveled once more to Japan, hoping to elude the Guardians in the process. I was lucky and managed to forge bonds with Nodoka, perhaps not paternal ones, but bonds nonetheless.</p><p>An old photograph appeared, showing a certain young pigtailed martial artist about to knock on the door of a house.</p><p>"When I saw the activity of the Ancients in Japan, I was appalled that they had gotten that far. Fortunately, I was unable to locate a Guardian City, but that does not mean that there is not one there. I suspect the strangeness of the Nerima area originated from the Ancients and their meddling. Always meddling, biding their time as the millennia pass, waiting to be released."</p><p>The view of the picture panned out and the title of the chapter could be seen.</p><p>Chapter One: A Death in the Family</p><p>The picture began to fill with color as motion could be seen there. Ranma knocked on the door to the house, apparently impatient.</p><p>From within the house, a woman's voice can be heard, speaking rapidly in English. Footsteps could be heard heading towards the door, and the door quickly opened.</p><p>"Oh, hello Ranma-kun!" The woman in the doorway was fairly beautiful, with her hair a dark shade of red, almost chestnut and her bluish eyes, and she had a silk-wrapped bundle upon her back. In her left hand she had a telephone; it became apparent that she was the one speaking on the phone. Judging from her facial features and tone of voice, she was happy to see Ranma there though apparently something was bothering her as well.</p><p>"Hello momma." Ranma smiled a warm smile.</p><p>"Oh, where are my manners, come in my son, come in." Ranma's mother quickly led the teen inside, and then she promptly sat him down at the table in the dining room. She began to cook from within the kitchen.</p><p>Ranma began to fidget in his seat; he looked like he wanted to say something, but would not open his mouth. He got out of his seat and went into the kitchen to help his mother.</p><p>"Ranma, what brings you here today?"</p><p>Ranma grimaced, "Do I need an excuse ta visit you, momma?"</p><p>Nodoka smiled a bit, "Of course not, son. Though, it does seem odd that you are here without your fiancée."</p><p>Ranma scratched the back of his head, obviously because he was nervous. "Well, Akane and I… err…"</p><p>"Oh, so it was one of <i>those</i> times?'</p><p>Ranma nodded emphatically at that statement. Nodoka sighed and continued to cook. The two of them worked quietly for a while, each seeming to know what was needed to be done next. They worked perfectly together as mother and son… erm… daughter… Ranma had gotten splashed in the middle of cooking, and they continued to work. After they had finished, Nodoka spoke up.</p><p>"Ranma-chan, I have to tell you something."</p><p>Ranma raised her eyebrow. "What is it momma?"</p><p>"My father, your grandfather, is dead."</p><p>Ranma's face turned pale as a sheet. Her body began to quiver. A view of the clock showed the time to be three thirty-three. "M-m-my g-grandfather?" Her face took on an angry expression. "How come I ain't never heard of him before?"</p><p>Nodoka's face became downcast. "Because, my son, I didn't want to cause you any dishonor."</p><p>Ranma's angered face turned to one of confusion. "Wha?"</p><p>"My mother was pregnant with me before she met the person she married. My father was a person named Edward Roivas. An American."</p><p>Ranma's eyes narrowed. "But he died recently?"</p><p>"Yes, about two months ago. I only just now found out, and his funeral is in a week."</p><p>Ranma's voice changed to a serious one. "How did you find out about this, momma?"</p><p>"Your cousin, Alex, called me; she was the one who identified the body."</p><p>"Wait, he was murdered?"</p><p>"Yes, my son."</p><p>"Have they caught the murderer?"</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "No my son, they have not. At least that is what your cousin indicated. The funeral is in a week, I am going."</p><p>"Momma, I'm not gonna let you go to America by yourself."</p><p>Nodoka smiled at her son turned daughter. "I was hoping that you and Akane-chan would accompany me on this trip. Your offer is a sign of manliness, Ranma."</p><p>"Akane? Feh, I don't need no stinking uncute tomboy ta come with me on the trip."</p><p>"Ranma! It isn't very manly to talk bad about your fiancée."</p><p>Ranma murmured, "Sorry momma."</p><p>"The plane leaves for Rhode Island in three days. We shall go to the airport then."</p><p>Ranma nodded and smiled. "Alright momma. I'll let the Tendos know about our trip, and invite 'kane along."</p><p>Nodoka walked over to Ranma and gave her a hug. "Before you go, I think you should eat some dinner first, and perhaps get some hot water."</p><p>Ranma grinned widely. "Food!"</p><p>The two ladies set the table and placed the food there. Shortly afterwards, Ranma used a kettle to return to his male form. He began to eat at his normal alarmingly fast rate before being berated by Nodoka. He apologized before continuing to eat at a, albeit still fast, slower pace. After he finished the meal he helped his mother with the dishes before giving her a hug and preparing to leave.</p><p>"Good-bye, momma. I'll see you soon."</p><p>"Good-bye Ranma-chan."</p><p>Ranma blushed a bit at that statement. He grasped the doorknob to open it and get out of the house.</p><p>*FLASH*</p><p>Ranma found himself in a room, similar to that of an American church. He stood upon a platform that lead up to a hand that was closed around a book. Echoing through the area was the sound of millions of tortured screams that seemed only to get louder as he approached the hand. On either side of the path were statues each with a name marker underneath it. The first on his left read P. Augustus. As he continued down the path, he noticed one had the name E. Roivas engraved on the base. He looked up at the rest of the statue.</p><p>'<i>E. Roivas… Could this be Edward Roivas? My Grandfather?'</i></p><p>Ranma paused to stare at the statue some more before the screams seemed to get louder and the statue seemed to tell him to move on. In fact, he heard an echo in his head as he was staring at the statue.</p><p><i>Grab the book, child. You may be Humanity's last hope…</i></p><p>Ranma continued down the path, reaching the end of it. He was surprised as the hand holding the book seemed to unclench its fingers from around it. Ranma reached out his arms to hold the book, which he now somehow knew to be the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

He shrugged off the feeling, but placed the book somewhere… He didn't know where, it just disappeared, but he knew he still had it.</p><p>When Ranma stepped outside the door, the first thing he noticed was that it was nighttime.

Shokakugan Entertainment publishes Ranma in Japan. The Matrix is a registered trademark of AOL Time Warner, and was written by the Wachowski Brothers.</i></p><p>Rare was the day where Ranma would find enough time to himself to truly relax. Luckily today was one of those rare days. The pigtailed boy was sitting in a lotus position, in an area surrounded on all sides by trees.</p><p>Now let it not be said that Ranma is an unintelligent person. Just that if it has nothing to do with martial arts, he had no interest in it. However, meditation was one of the few things outside of the Art that interested him. There were many reasons for this. For one, he found it easier to think in meditation, and his meditation felt more real than the life he lived when he was not in it. Ranma liked the feeling of realness, and perhaps he would find a solution to the mess that his father had helped him in to.</p><p>'<i>The girls ain't gonna give up. Not now, not ever. I need to make a decision. I don't wanna hurt their feelings though. And there might be more... consequences.'</i></p><p>Ranma sat on that thought as it came out. Soon his mind was on a completely different subject though. It was on nothing. Mind of no mind. That is the point of meditation, and the pigtailed martial artist soon reached it. To anyone outside, Ranma was encased in an aura, one of pure white. This was a true ki master.</p><p>The feeling of being real soon became the sole focus in his mind. Reality, what was it? Was this real? Was he real? Does it really matter?</p><p>Ranma opened his eyes.</p><p>Where was he? Underwater, he could feel tubing in his throat! What was this? There were tubes sticking in him everywhere! Or more accurately, <i>her</i>, everywhere. Ranma began to thrash her body around before a shock went directly into her mind.</p><p>Ranma opened his eyes.</p><p>To see a world of green scrolling symbols. Ranma blinked, and he was in the park once more, but in his mind something affirmed itself. The wool had been pulled over his eyes before; he would not be tricked again. That pod was more real than here. He didn't like lies. He would find a way out once more. He would seek it. That... that was the solution.</p><p>#Anomaly detected: Pod Serial No. 5816238120. Individual: Ranma Saotome. Send tracking program to anomaly. Redirect subject: Ryoga Hibiki to Nerima Park. Observe. Sentinel programs keep in reserve#</p><p>Ranma slowly climbed to his feet, before hearing a cry of "Ranma, prepare to die!"</p><p>On top of Mount Horaizan, two people were locked in a fierce battle. Saotome Ranma was fighting for her life, and for her manhood. Prince Herb had already used the Kaisuifuu to unlock his curse and return to his male form. Ranma was desperately trying to do the same, but Herb wouldn't let her get near the flowing water.</p><p>"You can't win, Saotome. There is no chance of it."</p><p>Ranma glared at the Musk Prince. The man claimed to come from a bloodline of a dragon and definitely had the power and ability to back it up. How could she beat someone like him? Still... She had to try. Leaping at the floating man, she thrust her fist towards his jaw. Herb simply grabbed her hand, spun around and threw her into the ground.</p><p><i>Damn it... I need to think of something to do.</i></p><p>"What's wrong Saotome? Finally realize the truth?"</p><p>Slowly getting up to her feet, she spat out, "I will not lose, Herb!" She began to try to lead him into a spiraling motion.</p><p>"I don't think so, Saotome. That technique doesn't work on me. Now try this!" A yellow energy blade streamed from the man's arms towards the pigtailed girl. She dodged, of course, but having to get out of the spiral step to do so. Instead of hitting her, it struck the mountain where the streaming steaming hot water from the Kaisuifuu was coming out. A crack wormed its way down from where that ki blade struck, causing the mountain to break apart. A glint of copper announced the falling kettle that was the Kaisuifuu.</p><p>"No!" Ranma leapt at it, only to be stopped by Herb. However a fanged boy who was watching the battle also jumped towards it, falling into the same crevice.</p><p>"Ranma," he yelled, "I'll get the Kaisuifuu; you just concentrate on Herb!"</p><p>Nodding, she turned her attention back on the prince. He didn't even look winded. She herself was panting and could barely stand. Herb smirked and looked her over. "Seems you're ready to continue." He then flew at her with an alarming speed. Grasping her arm he threw her head first into the ground, leaving a large crater there. "I guess I win, Saotome."</p><p>As she climbed to her feet, her eyes remained closed. "I told you before, Herb..." The pigtailed girl's eyes started to open. "I will not lose!" Her eyes opened, revealing something far different than her usual blue orbs. These eyes were red on black, with three spoke-like colorations towards the center. Suddenly she was on her feet.</p><p>"If the Hiryuu Shoten Ha won't work on you, then maybe this will." She began to do a few quick formations with her hands. "<i>Fuuton: Hiryuu Kaze no Jutsu!"</i> (Wind Element: Rising Dragon Wind Technique) Holding her hands near her face, she blew with her mouth and what looked like a horizontal tornado came out and flew towards the dragon descendant. The wind took form into that of a dragon.</p><p>"Impossible... Ninjutsu?" Herb desperately tried to fly out of the way of it, barely avoiding a direct strike.</p><p>Suddenly the ground exploded upwards near Ranma. "Ryoga! Were you able to get it?"</p><p>The fanged boy bounded out of the hole he made with a sad expression on his face. "I'm sorry Ranma; it broke when it hit the ground."</p><p>"Damn it!" Ranma cursed before getting punched across her jaw, causing her to fall backwards. She used her momentum to do a back flip and land on her feet. The redhead stared Herb directly in the eye. "So, you hope to beat me with taijutsu now, do you?" Suddenly, she wasn't there anymore.</p><p>The Musk prince franticly began to move his head around, looking for something, anything that could help him locate that troublesome woman.</p><p>"Now Herb-chan, you wouldn't be looking for me now would you?"</p><p>There! He turned quickly and launched a ki blade at the figure he saw there. She didn't even dodge. Instead, she began to melt. "What is this?"</p><p>"It's called a replication, Herb-chan. You took away my manhood. Now I'll show you how much suffering you have caused me; I'll show you why I fought so desperately. <i>Mangekyou Sharingan: Tsukiyomi!</i>" Her eyes changed once more as she stared into the eyes of the Musk prince. The spokes formed a three pronged spiral of black that captured his attention. He collapsed to the ground, barely remaining conscious.</p><p>"I... I... I'm... sorry..."</p><p>"Prince Herb!" Herb's two attendants rushed to his side and began to help him up.</p><p>"Be glad I didn't kill you, Herb. I could do that easily regardless of your bloodline. You can't stand against my Sharingan." Ranma collapsed to the ground after that, the other two that were watching the match rushed over to her.</p><p>Glancing down at the redhead, Ryoga sighed. He had waited so long to get his revenge on Ranma, and now he couldn't do it. He felt her pulse... and paled.</p><p>"What is it, Ryoga?" A man with long black hair and glasses asked.</p><p>"It's too slow. We need to get her to a doctor, and fast!" He picked her up and began to run off in an inane direction with Mousse right behind him. The scenery changed, and changed again.</p><p>"Ryoga! I don't know how you did it, but we're in Nerima! I'll lead the way from here. We're going to Tofu-sensei." Mousse grabbed the lost boy's hand and practically dragged him as they roof-hopped to Ono Chiropractic. The long-haired boy called out, "Tofu-sensei! Come quick!"</p><p>An older man dressed in a work robe stepped out from the back of the chiropractor's office. His eyes were covered in glasses, and he stood about six inches taller than Ryoga. The light glinted off the man's glasses once as he looked over at Mousse. Narrowing his eyes as he looked at the bundle in Ryoga's hands, he said, "Bring Ranma to me, and tell me what happened." <i>Her ki is almost dry, and yet her chakra is higher than her ki. Odd; even for Ranma. Perhaps my old friend will indeed awaken soon.</i></p><p>As the two youths explained the events that happened leading up to them bringing her there, Doctor Tofu's face became more and more concerned. When they told him what exactly Ranma did to Herb, his face twitched as he asked the pair, "Are you sure that's the technique she used?"</p><p>Ryoga nodded vehemently. "She called it the Mangekyou Sharingan."</p><p>Tofu gasped. The only way for Ranma to have used the Mangekyou would be if he had awakened. "I haven't had to use this technique in a while, but it should help Ranma out enough so that she can wake up." Tofu quickly made a few hand seals and placed his hands over Ranma-chan's body. Whatever wounds she had seemed to close up, and her pulse quickened.</p><p>Ranma gazed down upon the destruction that was once Nerima. He saw the</p><p>bodies of his friends and enemies alike lying there. A slight chuckle</p><p>escaped him; a chuckle that expanded into a full blown maniacal laugh.</p><p>"They're gone! They're all gone! I'm free from them!"</p><p>Ranma placed the mask in his hands on his face, and it began to rain.</p><p>The rain just bounced off of the suit that he was wearing.</p><p>"It was wise of me to wear this suit. Now I will never change again.</p><p>Japan bores me... Let's see how Jump City faces my wrath."</p><p>Lightning struck behind Ranma, illuminating his orangish metalic mask.</p><p>Five years later:</p><p>It was a gloomy night in Jump City as a ship in the port exploded</p><p>on its deck. A humanoid being made almost entirely of rock began</p><p>lifting various crates off of the deck. It grunted and threw the crate</p><p>that it was holding off the ship and into the water.</p><p>A garrison of SWAT officers began to shoot from behind their shields at</p><p>the creature. The creature picked up another rather large crate and</p><p>threw it at the annoying gnats.</p><p>The police scattered like ants; however, they were not quick enough as</p><p>it looked like the crate was going to fall on them. The police cringed</p><p>anticipating certain doom; doom that never came. They opened their</p><p>eyes to find the crate hovering above them, surrounded with a black</p><p>aura.</p><p>"Don't you ever learn Cinderblock?" A male voice asked.</p><p>The police glanced over in the direction of the voice to find a group</p><p>of five apparent teenagers dressed in various clothing. Three were</p><p>male, and the two that were female were hovering. The speaker was</p><p>wearing red and yellow, had a thin black strip covering his eyes, and</p><p>had a big "R" over his heart. One of the other apparent males had many</p><p>electronic parts covering his body, including what looked like a gun</p><p>for a hand that was aimed straight at the creature now identified as</p><p>Cinderblock. The remaining male was wearing a purple body suit that</p><p>went nicely on his green skin and pointed ears. One of the hovering</p><p>girls had glowing green eyes and a green aura surrounding her hands;</p><p>she wore a purple suit, purple fingerless gloves, and boots to match.</p><p>The remaining teen was hovering with a blue cloak overshadowning her</p><p>forehead, and there was a black aura coming from her hands extending to</p><p>the crate.</p><p>Cinderblock's eyes glowed red and glared at the teens.</p><p>"Titans go!" Yelled what looked like the leader of the group.</p><p>And go they did, the girl in the blue cloak turned towards Cinderblock</p><p>with the crate in tow. The crate flew at the stone man and was</p><p>instantaneously demolished with one punch.</p><p>The other girl began tossing green balls of light at the stone creature</p><p>which exploded on impact; however, these seemed to have no effect</p><p>whatsoever.</p><p>The cybernetic young man fired a beam of sonic energy at the creature,</p><p>again to no avail. Cinderblock swatted at the flying girl, but she</p><p>flew out of his reach.</p><p>"Azarath Metreon ZINTHOS!" The caped girl cryed as her black aura</p><p>surrounded several objects and flung them at the stone man. The</p><p>objects kept hitting Cinderblock, knocking him back further and further</p><p>towards the edge of the ship.</p><p>The young man in the black and yellow cape threw several explosive</p><p>disks at Cinderblock. The stone creature ran at the young man only to</p><p>be stopped by a green rhinocerous that slammed itself into him.</p><p>Cinderblock struck the rhino with his fist and sent it flying. As it</p><p>flew it morphed into the green teen.</p><p>"Beast Boy, no!" Cryed the flying girl with the purple tunic as she</p><p>flew to catch the teen.</p><p>Beast Boy said to the girl, "I'm alright Starfire, just help Robin."</p><p>As Starfire glanced down towards the battle, she saw Robin engaging</p><p>Cinderblock with his metal staff. Beastboy morphed into a falcon and</p><p>dove towards Cinderblock. The man with cybernetic body parts fired</p><p>another sonic blast at the stone creature before running out at it.</p><p>The girl in the cape wrapped her aura around the nearby crane and used</p><p>it to clutch at Cinderblock.</p><p>"Cyborg, let's hit him at the same time." Robin said to the cybernetic</p><p>young man.</p><p>Cyborg nodded to Robin, and then they both ran at Cinderblock, jumped,</p><p>and kicked him. Cinderblock moved back an inch, broke the crane</p><p>latched onto him, and swatted the two teens off of the ship. Cinderblock</p><p>then charged at the caped girl and she couldn't get out of the way in time.</p><p>"No! Raven!" cryed Beast Boy who then turned into a T-rex and charged</p><p>Cinderblock, knocking him back a few feet. Starfire began to throw her</p><p>green energy blasts at Cinderblock, then she threw one massive blast at</p><p>Cinderblock, kicking up dust and obscuring him from view.</p><p>Starfire landed, Cyborg, Robin, and Raven managed to get back onto</p><p>the ship and stood next to Starfire. Beast Boy backed up to be near</p><p>them as well, in his natural form.</p><p>The dust began to clear, and there was Cinderblock, standing there, unfazed.</p><p>"No Way, Star pulls a massive blast and he still stands?" Beast Boy inquired.</p><p>"Apparently. This does not look good." Came from Raven.</p><p>"Indeed, I will have to agree with Raven, Cinderblock seems to be in</p><p>better stamina this time." From Starfire.</p><p>A red energy blast exploded on Cinderblock, and he was knocked</p><p>back a few feet.</p><p>"Where'd that come from?" Robin asked.</p><p>"My sensors are picking up an energy reading matching the</p><p>blast from... there!" Cyborg pointed behind them on the docks,</p><p>and they saw another energy blast heading towards Cinderblock,</p><p>only this time punctuated by a "Mokou Takabisha!"</p><p>"It looks like you Americans could use some help."</p><p>The Titans looked at the one who this line came from.</p><p>She had a spotted bandana wrapped around her head, and she had</p><p>her shoulder-length hair in a pig-tail. She was wearing a red</p><p>chinese silk wooden button shirt, and black silk pants. She appeared</p><p>to be wearing slippers as well. On her back she carried a large</p><p>backpack and a red bamboo umbrella.</p><p>The girl could be heard saying "This is for you, Ranma and Ryouga."</p><p>as she charged Cinderblock, pulling a mallet from apparently nowhere</p><p>and striking him. Cinderblock staggered back, confused as a few cracks</p><p>appeared in his stone body.</p><p>"Titans, help her!"</p><p>Starfire flew at the golem and began to throw more energy blasts, and</p><p>she also started using eye beams. Cyborg blasted Cinderblock with his</p><p>sonic cannon, and Robin threw several bombs at it. The girl smirked.</p><p>"Let's see how you deal with this, monster!"</p><p>She raised her finger up high and leapt at the creature. She plunged</p><p>her finger into Cinderblock's leg and cried:</p><p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!"</p><p>Suddenly the golem's legs exploded into tiny shards of stone, with the</p><p>explosion knocking even the girl back a few feet. The girl adjusted</p><p>her hair and looked back at the Titans, who had landed and were staring</p><p>at her.</p><p>Robin spoke up, "Who are you?"</p><p>The girl scratched the base of her pigtail. "Oh, my name is Akane</p><p>Tendo, sorry 'bout this."</p><p>Disclaimer: I do not own any of the characters in this piece of</p><p>fanfiction.</p><p>The Wild Villain (Tentative Title)</p><p>By: Ellf</p><p>"So, do you have the stuff?" Ichido Takamura asked his friend when he pulled up on his motorcycle.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah... I got your stuff." Seijiro Yamada pulled off his backpack to show Jiro its contents. Jiro nodded.</p><p>"Good, we'll head out then, the others will meet us there." He smiled at his friend. The two headed off on their motorcycles and travelled for a bit before pulling over at their stop, an abandoned shrine located on the water.</p><p>As the two were walking along towards the shrine, Seijiro spoke up, "So what is it we're doing here, anyway? Weren't we told not to come here?"</p><p>"What do you know about the Legend of the Orochi, Sei?"</p><p>The young man glanced at the shrine ahead. "Not much. I don't pay much attention to that mythology crap."</p><p>"Ah, Sei, but that's why we're here tonight. Legend has it that around three hundred years ago, on this shrine's very spot stood the Moon Cave, a place where Orochi himself lived for one hundred years before. And every year on the full moon of April he would claim the most beautiful woman in Kamiki as his sacrifice. But, Orochi was stopped... by the efforts of the white wolf, Shiranui and the great swordsman, Nagi. However, Shiranui died in the destruction of the Orochi. Legend also has it that Orochi returned one hundred years later to once and for all be destroyed by Shiranui reborn and the descendant of Nagi, Susano." Ichido smirked as he finished his sentence. "As I said, this is where Orochi's base was, and it might have some <i>spooky power</i>." He finished that sentence in a distorted voice as he waggled his fingers at his friend.</p><p>Seijiro's face paled a bit at the last part of it. "So we're going to this shrine for what reason?"</p><p>"Why else? It's cool and might have some things of value to sell off."</p><p>Shrugging, Seijiro followed his friend up the stairs to the dilapidated shrine. The shrine itself couldn't have been less than one hundred years old, and it led all the way down to the water. Upon entering, Seijiro's eyes had to adjust for the darkness, and he pulled two flashlights out of his backpack and handed one to Ichido.</p><p>"Ugh... I've never seen a shrine in such bad condition." Seijiro commented. The shoji separating the rooms were torn and everything had a fine layer of dust.</p><p>"Never mind that, follow me." Ichido took off towards the back of the shrine at a fast pace that Seijiro was hard pressed to follow. The two quickly made it to the end of the room where three others were waiting. Seijiro quickly appraised the room. Hanada Yamamoto, a rather large young man with a fairly generic face, leaned against the wall opposite the entrance to the room. Nishiro Daikoku, who was next to him and the contrast of body types was immense. Where Hanada was large, Nishiro was small and it was like that all of their lives. The fifth and final member of their group, Homura Raito glanced at Ichido on their way in. A guardian statue stood in the center of the room, the only well kept thing in the entire shrine. Though small, it gave a sense of peace to the place.</p><p>"So why, exactly are we here, Ichido?" Homura asked, he stepped towards his friend and tripped over the guardian statue.</p><p>"Careful now," Nishiro sneered. "Wouldn't want the kami to wake up and yell at us for being unfaithful."</p><p>"I'll tell you what I think of unfaithful, Nishi, old friend. Honor and humility... All a load of crap. Like this guardian statue." Homura growled at it and kicked. A line started to form down its center.</p><p>Seijiro yelped out as Homura's leg struck the statue. "Hey! What did the statue ever do to you? Why don't we leave it be?"</p><p>"Because it's there, Sei. Representing tradition that is full of crap. After all, who believes in the Orochi anyway?" He kicked the statue again, another spiderweb-like crack formed in it before it shattered. Five paper masks fell out of the remains of the statue. Each one marked with a different character. Homura picked them up. Unbeknownst to him a black mist slowly began to fill the room.</p><p>"Hey, Homura, what's that you got there?" Hanada asked.</p><p>"Just some weird masks, fatty. Here, this one has the start of your name on it, why don't you put it on?"</p><p>Homura handed the mask with the "ha" character to Hanada, and passed the rest of the masks out to the others.</p><p>"How come I got the one with the "ro" on it?" Seijiro complained.</p><p>"Because there weren't any with "Se" on them, Sei." Homura answered, and as they brought the masks up to their faces, the black mist in the room began to take form. A shadow of an eight headed serpent appeared and wrapped around the boys as their masks were put on.</p><p>When the mist cleared, five changed beings stood where the boys were, looking around confused. This only lasted a moment before the beings stood up at attention. "We must ready this place for Lord Orochi's return." The green one that had been Ichido said.</p><p>"Yes, his return!" The yellow one repeated.</p><p>"All hail, Lord Orochi!"</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Well, I guess I fooled you all. April Fools! Congrats on seeing some clips of unfinished fics of mine.</p>
