</div>'Can't You see that I Love You?'<br/>Part 2<p>Ranma sat on the wall surrounding the Tendou compound. Since his fight with Ryoga, and finding out about the lost boy's curse. Everything had quieted down a bit. Because of this, Ranma was allowed to realize some things. Kasumi seemed to be avoiding him for some reason he could not fathom, but it was starting to concern him dearly. He didn't think he had any romantic intrest in her, but it still hurt him a bit when she tended to find something else she needed to work on elsewhere.<p>Akane seemed to be treating him a wary attitude. He felt guilty about doing it, but Ranma constantly had to egg the girl into something other than placidness towards him. Ranma admitted to himself he liked Akane, and liked her offer to be friends, even if she found out he was a guy (though, he didn't really see a problem with guys being just friends with girls). The problem, though, was that this 'friendship' was lacking something, a feeling of confedentiality, of trust. It wasn't like she didn't trust him, or anything, it was more like Akane wasn't telling him something important. It was something about the moans he had heard that one night; did Kasumi and Akane believe in ghosts? Is it some dark secret, like their mother died a horrible death in the house, and they wouldn't talk about it? Ranma felt it would be tactless to ask about it, but it was still irritating him to no end that Akane wouldn't be forthcoming.<p>Nabiki. Ranma didn't know what to make of her. She seemed easy-going, and nice to everyone else exept him and his father. Ranma didn't know what he had done to earn her ire; he doubted it was the engagement, since Kasumi easily accepted it, and put Nabiki off the hook. Maybe it was because Kasumi accepted it, and she felt that it wasn't fair for her sister to have to be drummed into it. Ranma had made a vow to himself that he wouldn't do anything to hurt Kasumi, including forcing her into something that would make her unhappy, even for his or her own honor and family honor. Ranma allowed a slight hint of arrgance in, thinking maybe Nabiki was secretly jealous of Kasumi, but took it out on Ranma, since she couldn't bare to bring harm, emotional or physical, to Kasumi. Ranma noticed how close Nabiki seemed to Kasumi, even often waking up just to greet her oldr sister, sometimes concerned about her always waking up so early.<p>Ranma would like to get to know Nabiki, she seemed pretty smart and all. And if they did, bysmallinsignificantchance... end up in the same family, it wouldn't hurt to be on good terms with his potential... ... sister-in-law.<p>"RANMA! PREPARE TO DI-"<p>"Not right now, Ryoga, okay?" Ranma asked with a sigh, still looking out into the neighborhood.<p>"YOU THINK MY VENGENCE IS GOING TO WAIT? BECAUSE OF YOU I'VE SEEN HELL!"<p>"Really?" Ranma asked, nonchillantly, "What does it look like? Specifically?"<p>Ryoga blinked, "What type of stupid question is that?"<p>"Anyway," Ranma started on changing subjects; Saotome defensive tactics #7; the inane question to derail your enemie's train of thought, "You like Akane, right?"<p>"Ah..." Ryoga started to blush, and turn away.<p>"You have any idea why she acts so weird towards me? I notice she doesn't seem to act that way to you."<p>"That's because you're a *jerk*, Ranma!" Ranma sighed to himself, realizing he wasn't going to get a straight answer from his current nemesis.<p>"I guess..." With that, Ranma jumped down behind the wall, out of Ryoga's sight.<p>"HEY! GET BACK HERE AND FIGHT ME!" Ryoga leap over the Dojo grounds wall, only to find Ranma missing, "RANMA, YOU COWARD!"<p>"Did you refuse a fight, boy?" Genma asked, as Ranma casually walked by his father lounging in the living room.<p>"Na, I already fought him twice, and until he issues another *official* challenge, I ain't gonna worry about it." Ranma didn't mention that both fights were a draw, with the second fight almost ending with Akane breaking it up due to the property damage they were causing. Ranma stopped for a second, and turned to his father with a musing expression, "Hey Pop, ah..."<p>"Something you want, boy? Spit it out."<p>"Uh, this thing with Kasumi, well, she's been avoiding me and all, it seems like, and..."<p>"What did you do to her?" Genma accused, glaring at his son.<p>"Yes, what is it you have done to my dear Kasumi?" another menacing voice asked from behind the pigtailed boy.<p>Ranma quickly spun to find Soun standing behind him menacingly, "NOTHING! NOTHING, I SWEAR!" Ranma calmed himself down when Soun seemed a bit more placid, "And that's the thing, I didn't do nothing to her, but she's like... avoiding me or something."<p>"Well then," Soun pondered, before getting a big smile, "My daughter is quite traditional, how about we hold the wedding tonight! That way, you two can talk all you like, and a proper wife wouldn't avoid her husband!"<p>"I'm going to go practice in the dojo," Ranma replied in an irritated tone.<p>Nabiki heard the conversation downstairs, as her own room door was open. After Ranma announced his going to the dojo, she closed it. Ranma had been there several weeks now, and she hadn't been able to persuade her father to give up the idea of marrying her beloved sister off to the bastard; Daddy *would* have to be subborn about this.<p>The middle Tendou sister sighed, and then smiled; deciding that it may just be time to work on the other end of things.<p>Ranma found Akane practicing in the dojo, going through one of her katas. Ranma had forgotten she had been in here for almost an hour, but presumed she wouldn't mind the company, "Hey... Akane, wanna spar, or something?"<p>Akane froze midway in a kick, and turned an incredulous expression to Ranma, "What did you say?"<p>Ranma's expression grew slightly irritated, "I asked you if ya wanted to spar."<p>"Actually sparring? Not jumping around like a jerk?" Akane asked guardedly.<p>Ranma huffed, "Well, if you don't want this, I'll just wait till you're done to use the dojo."<p>"No, I mean, sure, we can spar!" Akane quickly called out, as Ranma started to turn around. The pigtailed boy got a slight smile, and nodded his head, before joining the girl at the center of the dojo. Still unsure of Ranma's intentions, Akane threw a half-hearted punch at his chest, in which Ranma caught, and turned into a judo hip toss.<p>Akane laid on the ground, facing up, with Ranma still holding onto her fist, "You threw me."<p>Ranma blushed a bit, before turning away, "Sorry."<p>"No, no, don't be!" Akane responded, "I was careless." Akane stood up, and faced Ranma again, "Why didn't you ever do this before?"<p>Ranma coughed, before turning away again, "Well, I didn't think you'd take it well, or something, I don't know!"<p>"Ranma, how am I supposed to get practice in, if you don't take me seriously?"<p>"I don't know, alright?" Ranma snapped, "When I first got here, you know? You asked if I wanted us to be friends..." Ranma trailed off, as Akane looked at him expectantly, "Well, I wouldn't mind it, you know?"<p>"Then why do you have to act like a fool and insult me all the time?" Akane asked with a slightly hurt tone escaping.<p>Ranma looked at Akane with a sullen expression, "How else am I supposed to get you to treat like like something other than a walking plague? Ever since I asked you that question and you ran off, I don't know how I'm supposed to get your attention without you-"<p>When Ranma mentioned asking Akane the 'question', the raven-haired girl's expression changed to a guarded one, as she dropped her stance, and took a step back. Ranma almost growled, "SEE? You're doing it again! How are we supposed to be friends when you start acting like this all the time?" Ranma's eyes narrowed, "What's going on around here? All of this is related, isn't it? The way Kasumi's avoiding me, why Nabiki's always so mad at me, and why you're afraid-"<p>"I'm NOT afraid of you!" Akane snapped, gaining some of the fire back in her. Ranma stepped back at the interruption, and then smiled.<p>"Good, then you can tell me what's up with everyone, unless you're chicken..." Ranma held his smug expression, as he watched Akane's eyes dance from indignation to timidness and back.<p>"I'm going to go take a bath, you can have the dojo, Ranma," Akane replied in a curt voice, making sure to at least slightly push by Ranma on her way out. The pigtailed boy watched her go, as his expression dropped to a saddened one.<p>"Damn it, almost had her." Ranma gruffed to himself. Maybe he should try confronting Kasumi again. Maybe if he were to be helpful to her...<p>Kasumi almost whimpered, hearing the tell-tale steps of Nabiki, as she entered her room while she was putting up her own clothes from being washed, "Kasumi-chan, good news! I may not be able to get Daddy to budge, but I think Ranma'll crack faster."<p>"You're not planning to hurt him, or anything, are you?" Kasumi asked with a great deal of concern. That concern didn't go unnoticed by Nabiki, finding that it was bringing up far more anger and rage than she had ever had to deal with that she could recall. Kasumi baulked slightly at the darkened expression that Nabiki started to grow; her sister would never dream of hurting her, but Kasumi was still scared of the look Nabiki was gaining.<p>"How dare she!" Nabiki thought to herself, thinking that her older sister may be taking a liking to Ranma after all. Forcing her anger down tightly, Nabiki decided to let Kasumi know who she belonged to.<p>Kasumi's lips pursed in trepidation, as Nabiki began to slink over to Kasumi. Reaching up her right hand, Nabiki brushed her fingers through her sister's tresses, which were currently out of her usual ponytail, "Kasumi... chan, don't worry about Ranma..." Kasumi found herself frozen in place, as her sister's hot breath landed against her cheek, "You don't need anyone but me, and I couldn't stand anyone taking you away..."<p>A few minutes later, the still unlocked door to Kasumi's room opened, and the footsteps stopped, as if they ran into a soundless barrier, or the person making them had frozen, after a few moments, the door closed, leaving behind a few items of clothing Kasumi had missed pulling out of the wash.<p>With shuddering breaths, Kasumi remained curled up on her bed. She assumed that Nabiki had suggested ordering out, since Kasumi probably wasn't 'feeling well'. She adjusted her clothing to at least semi-decent, before turning to look out her window. It was still light, so she hadn't dozed off for as long as she thought. She got up, and saw her dresser.<p>She didn't recall Nabiki bringing in any of her clothes...
