</div>'Can't you see that I love You'<p>Ranma stepped out of Kasumi's roo with a neutral expression. Kasumi tried not to be forthcoming, but Ranma had experience with people trying to keep things from him, he did travel with one who was well notorious for that for ten years, after all. Unfortunately, he couldn't handle this problem like he did his father, and beat the crap out of the one holding secrets from him.<p>He decided to be blunt, and hope that Kasumi wouldn't get defensive. The look in her eyes almost shook Ranma's nerve, making him want to retract his accusation, but he decided to hold firm. He also stood precariously in front of the door, to ensure she didn't intend to make an escape before they discussed her... inappropriate relationship with her sister.<p>Kasumi's hands crumpled her skirt, as she kept her head down, abashed, even after Ranma had left her room. He knew, that was the only thought going through her head, coupled by notions of how disgusted Ranma had been with her, to be engaged to such a twisted and sick girl. He hadn't actually said it, but the eldest Tendou daughter could feel his eyes on her, staring in disgust and dissappointment.<p>He would be right, to leave her to her sister, Kasumi didn't deserve much else; Ranma's rejection just served to drive the point home. She felt the weight of the situation upon her, and she couldn't even sum up the strength to close her door, before she broke down in tears, far harder and anguishing than she usually indulged in after coupulating with Nabiki.<p>Dinner was late, that evening.<p>It also lacked a great deal of its usual eloquence and perfection that was the hallmark of Kasumi's meals, even if it was cooked by her. It didn't go noticed by any of the individuals at the table, however, since they were all in the midst of their own thoughts. The young woman that prepared the meal chose to eat earlier than everyone else, and had holed up in her room. Ranma sat across from both Akane and Nabiki, surrupticiously looking up to glare at the latter. Akane tried not to meet anyone's eyes, though she would sometimes steal glances at Ranma; but for the most part, she kept her eyes on her meal. Soun and Genma felt the tension, but for the life of them, neither knew how to broach the subject, and chose to ignore it as best they could.<p>Nabiki was contemplating the tension in the air, and she felt Ranma's eyes on her every so often without having to look up to confirm it. Kasumi was missing, and apparently very upset, Ranma she presumed was angry for some fashion with her...<p>So he knew, did he?<p>Nabiki guessed from the way her little sister was acting, Ranma had found out from a third party. Nabiki had to wonder about that, as her sister would more than likely try to keep her relationship with Kasumi a secret, so that none of it lead back to her. She had to wonder how much Akane told him, and how much she knew of it in the first place. Nabiki would have had to be naive to keep it a secret from the youngest Tendou, sure, no matter how discrete she and Kasumi attempted to be, but she didn't think Akane knew the full extent of the things between her two older sisters.<p>She also had to guess that Ranma had talked directly with Kasumi on the subject. She would need to go and comfort her older sister, remind her that there was nothing wrong with what they were doing, that it was none of Ranma's business, and she'll have him gone as soon as possible.<p>Tiring of the quiet and intense mood, Nabiki got up, without excusing herself, and made her way upstairs. Ranma watched her the whole time until she dissappeared from his sight with a stare that matched the atmosphere of the evening meal, before getting up himself, without requesting leave, and headed for the dojo to think on what needs to be done.<p>"Saotome," Soun started with a dry mouth, "It seems your son has a grievance towards Nabiki..."<p>"Kasumi-chan, open up," Nabiki commanded with a soothing voice. Her face didn't match the tone, as she waited impatiently for her eldest sister to open the door. After a few moments, Nabiki's already strained nerves gave way. With a much firmer tone, she made her command again, "Kasumi, open the damn door."<p>She heard the creaks of Kasumi's bedsprings from where she had been sitting on the edge of the bed, and the soft footsteps approach the door, albeit slowly and hesitantly. A few moments later, the eldest daughter opened the door, and meekly stepped to the side to allow her irritated sister entry.<p>Nabiki didn't turn around, as she made her way to her sister's bed. Once she arrived there, she sat down on the edge, where Kasumi had been sitting, and looked at her sister with an emotionless expression, "I see Ranma's already talked to you about us."<p>Kasumi nodded in reply, closing her door softly, and then fidgeting where she stood. The elder sister kept her head down, not wanting to show how upset she was.<p>Nabiki's expression softened, "Kasumi, listen to me. I know you're upset, but you don't have to worry about Ranma. What ever he told you doesn't apply to us, and-"<p>"Why doesn't it apply to us?" Kasumi countered harshly, allowing Nabiki to see her red rimmed eyes and tear streaked cheeks, "This... this is disgusting, what we've been doing! It's not right!"<p>Nabiki's face darkened, as she stood, and approached her sister. Kasumi stepped back in fear, bumping softly into the door. The younger woman pressed herself up against the older, and allowed a slight hint of mirth to appear on her face, "Kasumi, after all this time, you don't *really* believe that, do you?" Nabiki's face was so close, so close that Kasumi feared that nodding would bring her lips into capturing distance of Nabiki without her having to bend up. Nabiki continued, while her right hand started rubbing Kasumi's left thigh through her skirt, "I mean, how can something that you enjoy so much..." Nabiki's hand started to drift, "be so wrong?"<p>Kasumi closed her eyes, and hiccuped, "I... I don't enjoy this, Nabiki."<p>"Don't... lie to me," Nabiki growled, causing her sister to press as hard as she could against the door. Nabiki's expression became one of plead and concern, "Kasumi, we've been together for so long, I couldn't bare to be apart from you," the younger sister brought her head up, so that her right cheek softly brushed against Kasumi's right cheek, "and you need me, as much as I need you."<p>"But... we're sisters," Kasumi choked, while turning her head away from her sister's cheek.<p>Nabiki wouldn't be dissuayed, as she turned to follow, bringing her lips ever so lightly against Kasumi's right cheek, "Kasumi, it doesn't matter. We belong to each other." Nabiki brought her head down, and kissed Kasumi on her right collarbone, "I'm always going to be yours..." Nabiki nuzzled along Kasumi's neck, "... and you most certainly belong to me."<p>Nabiki pulled away from her sister, and Kasumi sighed in relief of the intense sensations Nabiki was bringing with her various touches. She allowed her younger sister to pull her by the hand to her bed, and sit her down. Nabiki then walked to the door, "I'll get rid of Ranma, I promise you." With that, she opened it, and left the room.<p>Kasumi slumped onto her knees from the bed, feeling too dismayed to do anything else but remain in shock.<p>Akane looked around for Ranma, but couldn't find him that morning. With a concerned frown, she started off for school on her own.<p>Nabiki arrived, and met up with her associates, just before a gust of wind passed by them all, and she felt a pair of hands on her waist. By the time to disorientation she was feeling wore off, she noticed she was on the school roof.<p>"We're going to have a little talk."<p>Nabiki turned around, to find Ranma standing a few yards away with his arms crossed, "You found out about what me and Kasumi have for each other, Saotome?"<p>"And I'm going to tell you to stop it," Ranma commanded, keeping his face hard.<p>"Stop it? Why in the Hell would I want to do that?" Nabiki challenged with almost and amused tone.<p>"Can't you see how much you're hurting her? Nabiki, Kasumi is a nervous wreck because of you!"<p>Nabiki allowed surprise to flash on her face; this wasn't an avenue of attack she was expecting. Nonetheless, she remained resiliant, "This is none of your damn business, Saotome! Me and Kasumi were fine before you showed up! Haven't you figured out you're the unwanted party here?"<p>"Don't try to turn this back on me!" Ranma retorted, uncrossing his arms and allowing them to fall to his sides, as his hands balled into fists, "What you two are doing... Kasumi even thinks its wrong, but she doesn't know how to get out of it!" Ranma stopped himself from yelling, remembering that he was doing this for Kasumi's sake, "I'm asking you, for Kasumi, end this now. She's not happy with the way things are right now."<p>"That's because you have her all twisted up, you bastard! What did you say to her? That it was wrong? What we're doing is disgusting? Well, Saotome?"<p>"I DIDN'T TELL HER NUTT'N!" Ranma shouted out; his voice carrying out across the rooftop, "I... just leave her alone, Nabiki. She's your sister, damn it!"<p>"I don't have to listen to you."<p>"THEN LISTEN... listen to her, for once!" Ranma turned away, then turned back to give one final glance to Nabiki, before heading down the stairs of the roof access. Nabiki stayed where she was, glaring daggers at the door he dissappeared into. She originally wanted to get rid of Ranma, but now she needed more than that. Her mind was now set on destroying Ranma Saotome, for trying to come between her and Kasumi.
