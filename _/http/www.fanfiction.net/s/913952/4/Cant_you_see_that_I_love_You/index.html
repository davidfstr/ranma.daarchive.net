</div>Can't you see that I Love You?'<br/>Part 3<p>Kasumi slowly dipped the breakfast plate into the soapy water, and absently began to scrub it. Ranma hadn't said a word to her all morning, for the first time she could recall. True, she had been avoiding him quite a bit, but he struck her as a rather determined young man. If circumstances were different, she could even appreciate that.<p>Soun walked in, and noticed his eldest daughter slowly working over a plate for a bit longer than she probably intended, "It's nice to know you're always so thorough, Kasumi-dear. Why, that is the reason you'll make Ranma a lovely wife!"<p>Startled, Kasumi accidentally dropped the plate into the dishwater, causing a slight splash, "Oh! Father, I didn't hear you come in. I hope breakfast was good for you."<p>"Oh, quite pleasant, thank you for such a delicious meal, as always!" Soun replied, "Are you troubled over something? You seemed a bit distracted."<p>Kasumi turned away from her father to hide her guilty expression, and picked the dish up that she had been washing, "It's nothing, father. You shouldn't worry about me."<p>The Tendou patriarch smiled brightly, "but I can't help but worry about my girls! At least I know one will be secure with a fine husband, as they both inherit the dojo!" Kasumi only gave a slight sound in reply, not really paying attention. Her father missed it, and then remembered what he was going to ask, "Oh, Kasumi dear, would you mind bringing some snacks for me and Saotome in a couple of hours or so? We'll be at the game table."<p>Soun waited a few moments, and after not getting a reply, shrugged, and started out the kitchen. Just then, Kasumi spoke, "Oh, father?"<p>"Yes?"<p>"Thank you for bringing my clothes up to my room last evening, I wasn't sure how I could have missed them."<p>Soun stiffened for a second, before replying, "Oh, um, don't mention it, Kasumi dear." Kasumi watched her father walk rather rigidly out of the kitchen, feeling a fearful trepidation building up in her chest.<p>Ranma looked to Akane with his own apprehension, while he accompanied her to school. Finally, Ranma gained enough courage to ask what had been bothering him, "Um, Akane?"<p>The youngest Tendou sister gave Ranma a fleeting glance, and the pigtailed boy swore he saw an almost fearful look, before she turned away. He started to frown, when he noticed she was picking up speed in her stride; a tell-tale sign that she was about to become evasive, "Are any of you adopted?"<p>Akane stopped short, and turned to Ranma with a confused expression, rather than a nervous one, "What?"<p>"Er..." Ranma began, "I was just... kind of wondering if Nabiki, Kasumi... or you were adopted or anything."<p>"What gave you that idea?" Akane asked, raising her eyebrow in curiosity.<p>"Ah, you see... it's just that all three of you act so different, I mean," Ranma stumbled, still not quite couragious enough to broach the subject he intended to.<p>"I guess..." Akane replied, before turning back towards her destination.<p>Ranma attempted a different tact, "I.. would also like to say that, if... and I mean 'if'... Kasumi was interested in other... people, I wouldn't stand in the way."<p>Akane froze in her stride, and turned to Ranma with her guarded expression, exept greatly subdued, "I... don't think Kasumi's seeing any boys."<p>In retrospect, this would be the point Ranma realized his tact failed him, "Er, what about, well... other girls?"<p>Akane's eyes went wide, before she started to focus herself in an attempt of casualness that Ranma could see right through, "wha-what do you mean?"<p>"What I mean is," Ranma schooled himself into an expression of determination. He jumped down from the fence, and landed on the other side of Akane, blocking her escape to the school, "What was that moaning the other night?"<p>Ranma was rather surprised when Akane started to shiver. She wouldn't look him in the eyes, "It's nothing. Old house, alright?"<p>Akane tried to step around Ranma, but he moved to cut her off, "No, not 'alright'. What the Hell's going on, really?"<p>Akane threw him an angry glare. "It's NOTHING, arlight?" Akane lied. With that, she shoved Ranma out of the way, and as she started to race to the school, Ranma shouted out.<p>"What were Nabiki and Kasumi doing with each other?"<p>Akane almost tripped, before catching herself. It was not easy to miss the wild-eyed fear plastered across her face.<p>Nabiki considered the best course of action to get rid of Ranma. As much as it irritated her, she decided, for Kasumi's peace of mind, that she would attempt to persuade Ranma without bringing any physical harm to him. That left only the option to make him feel as if he wasn't wanted around. Kasumi had started avoiding him, so that part was already taken care of. Akane was growing close to him, but for some reason, she was acting pretty apprehensive towards him; that should be easily workable, once she found out what Ranma did to Akane that had her on edge.<p>If Ranma left on his own accord, then their father couldn't place the blame on them, and their family honor would be sanctified, since it would be the Saotomes that broke the agreement.<p>"Nabiki?"<p>The Tendou girl turned from her musings back to her associate, "Hmm? Sorry, I have some family issues I'm thinking about. What were you saying, again?"<p>"How'd you find out?" Akane asked, not looking up from her lunch. She had told Ranma not to say anything, and she would tell him about it at lunch. Akane had found a secluded spot for Ranma and her to discuss the issue on the former's mind, and after making sure Kuno wouldn't be an irritating issue, the redheaded girl had made her way to the ravenhaired girl.<p>"Don't worry about it," Ranma replied in a terse voice, "So, that's why you and Kasumi have been hiding from me, and why Nabiki's hellbent on trying to make my life, um, Hell?"<p>"They've been close since Mom died almost ten years ago," Akane stated somberly.<p>The other girl snorted in an unfeminine manner, "A bit too close."<p>Akane didn't even look at Ranma, "Nabiki's extremely protective of Kasumi. It's best not to get in their way."<p>"I ain't trying to get in anyone's way," Ranma retorted, "but this... this isn't right!"<p>"DON'T YOU..." Akane blinked, looked around, and forcibly calmed herself, "I know that, but I can't stop it."<p>"Can't, or won't?" Ranma realised she was taking her attitude out on the wrong person, "Sorry. So, who else knows?"<p>"Nobody, I think," Akane replied, "If something like this got out, we'd..." She finally turned to look towards her lunch companion, "Ranma, there's already rumors and stuff about me going around school. For the most part, they've been taken care of, but if something like this got out, my whole family will suffer severely for it. You have to promise not to tell anyone!"<p>"Does your Dad know?" Ranma asked, evading the promise Akane was attempting to extract from him.<p>"N-no," Akane answered, "And it's best if he didn't."<p>"Feh," Ranma snorted, "You keep saying 'it's best', but the problem is still there." The red-headed girl stood up, "I can't condone this, but I'm not gonna do anything until I talk to Kasumi about this. If she was really happy about this, why did she offer herself up for the engagement so easily?"<p>"I don't know," Akane replied, subdued, "Please, things are okay the way they are!"<p>"No, they are *not* okay!" Ranma-chan stated, somewhat harshly, "I may not be the most socially adept guy around, but I do know that this isn't right. I'm gonna talk to Kasumi before I make any decisions on this." With that, Ranma walked off, leaving an extremely worried Akane sitting behind the wall they had hid near.<p>On the other side of the wall, Nabiki seethed. Kasumi's wishes be damned, Ranma had to go before he did something she would ensure with every iota of her being that he would regret.<p>Ranma had tried talking to Kasumi several times, and as usual, she would find something else she needed to do. Ranma was quickly becoming fustrated with his efforts, and was becoming more insistant. Finally, Kasumi decided that she needed a 'nap', and quickly headed for her room upstairs.<p>Undaunted, Ranma followed her up a moment after she had entered, and found her door locked. The pigtailed boy narrowed his eyes, and walked out to the back yard. Much to his expectations on the pleasant day, Kasumi, as usual, kept her window open.<p>With a powerful leap, Ranma propelled himself onto the dojo roof, and then the roof of the house. He came to stop above Kasumi's window, kneeled down, and leaned himself forward. He slid off the roof a bit, and caught his toes on the edge, before he fully fell.<p>Kasumi was sitting on her bed, with her hands clasped in front of her, staring down at them with an expression of sorrow. It broke Ranma's heart, but he had to do this. Deftly, he flipped into the room, startling Kasumi a great deal.<p>The girl shot to standing, and backed into a corner, before realizing who it was, "R-Ranma? What are you doing in here?"<p>"We need to talk." The tone was firm, commanding, and brooked no room for argument. Thus, Kasumi was trapped.
