</div>'Can't you see that I love You?'<br/>Part 1<p>Ranma finished up his morning kata, after waking up earlier than anyone else in the house. He was easily used to morning hours, with his life on the road, and his father's surprise attacks to keep him always on guard. Speaking of said parent, Ranma wondered if Genma would hold off today on their morning spar, since they are guests... *invited* guests of someone else's residence... for once.<p>Ranma turned his head, as the light in the kitchen had come on. Curious to see who else would be up at such a time, Ranma entered back into the Tendou household, and made his way to the lit room. As Ranma entered the kitchen, he stopped, finding himself a bit apprehensive of the young lady that was currenty occupying the room.<p>Kasumi still had her back turned, as she busied herself around her comfort domain, preparing the makings for breakfast. Ranma felt the urge to flee from the girl he found himself engaged to just last night, as the situation was far too akward for him to handle, particularly in the early morning.<p>Much to his chagrin, before he could make his getaway, Kasumi turned around, and froze at the sight of Ranma. Ranma himself began to studder almost incoherantly, attempting to find a pleasant greeting for his fiancee, before he noticed Kasumi's appearance. Her eyes were red and slightly puffy, and she seemed to draw into herself at Ranma's presence.<p>Ranma felt extremely guilty. He was pretty sure she didn't want to be engaged as much as he didn't want to, even if she seemed like a nice girl to get to know. He guessed she had been crying the whole night about her situation, after realizing what she volinteered for. With that in mind, Ranma felt he had to say something, "Um... sorry about all this."<p>Kasumi stared at him with an incomprehinsing look, before she dropped her gaze, and turned back to the counter, "It's... it's okay. It is for family honor, after all."<p>"You know? If you really don't want to, I'm pretty sure I can convince my Pop to drop the whole thing," Ranma smiled meanly, as he flexed his hands and popped his knuckles, "In fact, I think I'd enjoy convincing him..."<p>Ranma staggered slightly, as Kasumi swifty turned around with a near panicked expression. "Oh, it's no bother, really!" Kasumi urgently placated, "I don't mind at all!"<p>"But... you, well, you look kinda old... I MEAN.. not that you're old.. or anything. I mean you're older than me, and you don't deserve me, uh, because I'm so young. AH! Not that you don't deserve any man you want, I'm pretty sure you're a nice girl, but we, uh, just met... Yeah! We should start seeing other people... and, WAIT, that sounds like we're dating or something, I mean..."<p>If it weren't for her current distress, Kasumi would have giggled at Ranma's rambling, "Ranma-kun, that's nice that you're concerned about me, but I don't mind at all."<p>"But," Ranma restarted, gathering his thoughts in a rational order, "We just met, and all. And like your sister said, you gotta have a lot of guys after ya!"<p>Kasumi's face grew even more sullen, as she looked down at the floor. To Ranma, she looked like she was about to start crying again, "Aw, jeez! Whatever I said, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! I don't even know what I said!"<p>"I... don't get out much... since I was in school," Kasumi stated in a quiet voice.<p>"Oh," Ranma replied in a subdued tone, before firming himself again, "Well, you have a few friends, right?"<p>Kasumi nodded, "A few, but I don't see them too often."<p>"Well, I'm not really good at this friendship thing. I mean, I only had a couple of friends in my whole life, myself," Ranma started to suggest, "But, ah, I guess I'm going to be here a while, until my stupid old man gets tired of this engagement idea. I'll make sure he doesn't steal anything from you guys, too, by the way. So, if you need a friend, I... I guess I can be one for ya, I mean... if you want a friend... like me."<p>For the first time in a long time, Kasumi smiled sincerely, "I would like that."<p>Ranma relaxed, and released the breath he had started to hold until her reply, "Ah, that's cool, then." Uncomfortable with the conversation, Ranma decided to change subjects, "Whatja cooking? Need any help? I'm okay, but I'm mainly used to cooking campfire meals and instant ramen cups."<p>"That would be nice, I..." Kasumi trailed off, hearing someone descending from the stairs. Ranma notice a slight look of apprehension cross her face.<p>"Kasumi-chan, you should have woke me up to..." Nabiki stopped, and turned to spy Ranma, standing at the other entranceway to the kitchen. Her easy smile transformed almost instantly into a frigid expression.<p>"Ah... hi," Ranma waved nervously to the girl who seemed to spontaniously take a disliking to him. For the life of him, Ranma couldn't figure out where her animosity came from. Akane, he could understand, after the two bathroom incidents last night. But Nabiki, he didn't know what he had done to her at all.<p>Nabiki didn't reply, as she turned to Kasumi, "I really wish you wouldn't get up so early. Breakfast could wait a few more minutes it would take to wake me up, too."<p>"Ranma..." Kasumi took a quiet gulp, keeping her eyes on Nabiki, "Why don't you go take a bath? I ran the hot water already, so it's ready."<p>Ranma stared back and forth between the two sisters, puzzled at what just happened. With a quiet nod, Ranma took the subtle hint, and went out to the dojo to practice until his father woke up."<p>Ranma laid in bed, consumed by his thoughts. He and his father had been at the Tendous for almost a week already, and between the headaches provided by Akane, (geez, was she touchy!), that idiot Kuno, and his curse; the pigtailed martial artist was about ready to go mad.<p>Much to his dissappointment, he hadn't said much of anything to Kasumi, and vice versa. Whenever he had seen her, she would tell him rather quickly that she was busy. The weird thing was she would be very adimant about it whenever Nabiki was present.<p>Ranma snorted in fustration, and then sighed sullenly; it appears that Kasumi didn't really want his friendship, after all. Not that he could blame her; he himself thought it would probably be somewhat akward to be friends with your own fiancee. Not that they were going to seriously go through with their parents' stupid plans.<p>Ranma's eyes rolled to the ceiling, as he heard another low moan from the house.<p>Once again, Kasumi was up early in the morning, as Ranma usually noted her to be. Other than himself, he didn't really meet too many morning people, other than Ukyo, who used to wake up early to help his father get the yattai ready.<p>Ranma walked into the kitchen, no longer feeling as much of the nervousness and apprehension he had felt earlier whenever he talked with Kasumi. There was just something about her that always worked to set him at ease, and he learned to allow it to work its magic on him.<p>"Say... Kasumi," Ranma asked casually, going to the cabinet and grabbing himself a glass, "How old is this house?"<p>"I'm not quite sure, but I would imagine sometime before the War of the Pacific. But it had been remodled several times since then."<p>"Ah, okay," Ranma commented, filling the glass with water from the sink.<p>"Why do you ask?" Kasumi enquired, as she went to pull a few plates down from the cabinet to set the table.<p>"Well, every so often I hear it settling. I'm not really bothered by the moaning and stuff, but I was kinda curi-" Ranma was abruptly cut off by several plate crashing, and shattering on the floor. "Kasumi?"<p>Ranma wasn't sure, but he thought he saw the girl trembling slightly, "Kasumi, are you okay?"<p>Kasumi was clutching the counter edge with almost a white knuckled grip. "It's... just the old house, Ranma-kun," Kasumi replied in a strained voice, still not facing Ranma, "Nothing to worry about."<p>"But... the plates..." Ranma almost stuttered, wondering what had shaken her up so badly.<p>"It's okay, I'll get the broom and clean them up," Kasumi still hadn't turned back to Ranma.<p>"Here, at least let me help-"<p>"I SAID..." Kasumi had turned around, with that panicked expression Ranma was beginning to notice was rather common with the eldest Tendou daughter. She took a deep breath, and spoke again, albiet with obvious stress, "I'll do it, it was my mistake, anyhow."<p>"Um..." Ranma wasn't sure how to approach what he wanted to ask, but managed to state it without putting his foot into his mouth again, "is there something you want to talk about?"<p>"Thank you, Ranma, but I'll be fine," Kasumi replied in something a little higher than a whisper, "the bathwater's ready..."<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed, growing heavily suspicious. Almost in defiance, he replied, "I don't need to take one until after my morning spar with Pops."<p>"Whoops!"<p>"HEY!" Ranma-chan squawked, looking down at the front of her wet shirt. She then turned to glare at Nabiki, who was standing behind her with a mean smirk.<p>"Sorry, Ranma-kun. I'm just not always awake during the mornings."<p>Ranma stared at Nabiki intensely; she did that on purpose.<p>"Okay..." Ranma replied in a guarded tone, "Just be more careful."<p>"So should you, Ranma-kun." If Ranma didn't know better, that sounded almost like a challenge, or a threat.<p>Holding her glare for a few moments, Ranma turned away, "I guess I'll go take that bath now, after all." With that, the redhead walked upstairs to get her bath supplies. Nabiki watched Ranma leave the kitchen, and then turned back to Kasumi with a neutral stare. The whole time, Kasumi rapidly busied herself, trying her best not to look at Nabiki.<p>"Hey, Akane," Ranma turned to look down from the fence to the girl walking beside him, almost pointedly ignoring him. Ranma frowned, before working a bit harder to get her attention, "Yo, Macho-chick."<p>Akane froze, and her fists started to tighten. For a few moments, she seemed to be counting to herself, before starting again.<p>"Come on, Tomboy, I'm talk'n to ya!"<p>"SHUT UP, YOU JERK!" Akane bellowed, readying to swing her satchel at Ranma.<p>"Is Kasumi afraid of ghosts, or something?" Ranma asked seriously, readying himself to evade Akane's upcoming attack.<p>The question put pause into the raven-haired girl, "Uh, not that I know of, why?"<p>"Well, I was just telling her this morning that I heard the house moaning, and she got all scared..."<p>Akane quickly turned away from Ranma, and the pigtailed martial artist could feel the waves of apprehension and nervousness radiating from her. Finally, after almost a minute, Akane spoke, "Just... ignore it."<p>"Ignore it?" Ranma repeated, in question, "What's this all about?"<p>"Just forget about it, alright?" Akane replied, heatedly, before dashing towards the school. Ranma was left, puzzling over the reaction Akane left, and Kasumi's earlier.
