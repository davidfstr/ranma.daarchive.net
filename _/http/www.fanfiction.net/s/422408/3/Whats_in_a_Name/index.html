</div><p>Ok just to let you know these characters are not mine. They belong to the wonderful lady who created them. They are also distributed by VIZ Video. I am not nor will not gain any money by writing this story. This story is just being written for fun that is all.</p><b><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 3</p><p style="text-align:center;">School and a Challenge.</p><p></p></b>It is well known that if you drink too much that you will get what is known as a hangover in the morning. For one Ranma Saotome that is what he thought he had. The only thing was last night he was not drinking. No he was not drinking at all. After he had woken last night from his early nap and he had found the Tendo's and his father already eating dinner. It was surprising to Ranma that he even had dinner in the first place. The way his father was so greedy it wasn't often that Ranma would get dinner if he were late. The Tendo's said it was because they hated to see anyone go hungry. The fact that his father was tied up and set in front of the shoji board was interesting to.<p>After dinner though everything had become a blur. He had become so tired. He was even too tired to start a fire to heat water. So he would be able to change back into his boy form. Even now he was still stuck in his female form, and he hated it. Added to the headache he had, made his morning a pretty bad one.</p><p>"Oh my, Ranma you're up finally. Good that means you won't be late for school." Kasumi said in passing.</p><p>"School? What dose she mean school?" Ranma grumbled out holding his head wishing she hadn't shouted. Seeing his father sitting at the shoji board with Mr. Tendo Ranma made his way over to him.</p><p>"Pop what's this I hear about school? What do I need school for if I'm gonna be a martial artist any way?" Ranma asked as he approached his father.</p><p>"Ranma we are staying here for a while so it would be best if you get an education. What, you don't want to grow up to be an imbecile do you?" Genma said not even looking at Ranma.</p><p>"I AM NOT AN IMBECILE OLD MAN! Ouch my head." Ranma said while grabbing his head with his hands.</p><p>"Oh stop wining and get ready for school boy." Genma said while moving a shoji piece.</p><p>"You're in luck Ranma it's the same school Akane and I go to." Nabiki said while rushing past him on her way out the door.</p><p>"You had better get going boy. You don't want to be late on your first day of school."</p><p>"Hey maybe I'm just not ready yet O.K." Ranma was answered by having a satchel thrown into his arms. And having himself thrown out the door. Grumbling he ran after Nabiki and much to her surprise caught up with her.</p><p>"So where is my little sex toy today?" Ranma asked seeing Nabiki stiffen at his question and smiling because of her reaction.</p><p>"Akane goes to school early for a martial arts class from her sensai. I also would not call my sister a sex toy Saotome."</p><p>"Why not? Akane will be my fiancée after I beat that wimp of a boyfriend of hers. Then it will become a matter of time before her virtue is mine." Ranma said starting to laugh insanely which was interrupted by a rock hitting his female face. Reminding him just how much of a headache he had.</p><p>"Watch what you say Saotome. People don't like that sort of talk around here. Also don't spread lies around Saotome. They might just come back to haunt you." Nabiki said as she ran through some gates.</p><p>As Ranma ran through after her his eyes widened in shock at what he saw. There before him was Akane Tendo talking to the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. {Not counting Shampoo.} She wore a blue Chinese shirt that matched her big blue eyes. Her hair was as red as the light of the setting sun. Her skin so smooth, it was as if she always bathed in buttermilk. She made Akane look second rate and that was not easy in his eyes.</p><p>The problem was at the moment he was female and Akane was with the girl. It would be difficult to pick up the girl with those types of obstacles in the way. Akane already was a tease, and was already making it hard to get a good lay. Although he could probably get the girl in a matter of no time, it would make it difficult with his future wife hanging around the girl.</p><p>Ranma watched the two enter the school. As he watched he noticed that Akane had a frown on her face. He wondered if it had to do with his rival. Ranma was about to go search for some hot water when a boken-wielding boy impeded his path.</p><p>"Ah another of the Kami's beautiful creatures crosses my path. It must be fate that doth bring such beauty to my presence. I the one who is the Kami's blessed that doth stand before you. So who might you be my light of the morn?"</p><p>"Listen idiot I'm here to get to class and not talk to boken wielding idiots like you."</p><p>"Oh how you sound like my lovely Akane whose beauty is only rivaled by that of my pig tailed goddess."</p><p>Ranma looked at the boy with a questioning glance and thought. (Could this be the boy Akane was talking about? Is this idiot the one that is supposed to be able to beat me? Doesn't look like much to me. What was the name of the wimp? I know it started with a k or something like that.)</p><p>"So who are you to think that Akane is yours?" Ranma asked the boy.</p><p>"I did not give the proper greeting did I. How very inappropriate of me. I am the rising star of the kendo world. The undefeated Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, Tatawaki Kuno age seventeen."</p><p>"Well I'm sorry to disappoint you Mr. Blue Blunder but I think Akane will have her sights on someone ells here soon enough."</p><p>"Ahh do not be jealous my blond hared beauty for there is enough room in mine heart for yet another of the fairer sex. Yet you must still face the challenge of coarse."</p><p>"And what challenge would that be hmm?"</p><p>"In order to date with me you must defeat me." Kuno said while pulling out his boken.</p><p>"And who would like to date with you?" Ranma said while planting his foot in Kuno's face. He was surprised to see that even though the boy was knocked back some he'd just seemed to shrug off the blow as if he had not even felt a thing. Ranma's confidence began to slip at the sight. After all he had put a lot of power behind that kick.</p><p>"Ahh I see that thou art skilled indeed. Though not as powerful as my other two loves." Kuno then began to charge Ranma bringing his boken to bare on the boy turned girl.</p><p>Ranma was worried now as he took a few hits from the boken-wielding boy. He then saw an opening in the boy's attack and struck. Striking at the boy's vital points with both feet and hands Ranma leaped back from the boken-wielding boy breathing hard and wincing at the hits he had taken.</p><p>Kuno was just standing there looking into space. Kuno's eyes were like glass as he muttered. "That didn't hurt." Then fell on his face in front of the boy turned girl.</p><p>With a sigh of relief Ranma made his way into the school not noticing the black hared boy watching from the shadows. He also didn't notice the black hared boy jump from behind him into a third story window. All Ranma could think about was how close he had come to losing that match.</p><p>Later Ranma looked out at the class he was to be in. Most of the kids were pretty dull to his eyes. Though it was a plus that he did see Akane in his class as well. There was also this other that intrigued him also. He sat near the window and wore a red Chinese shirt much like Ranma's green one. The boy had black hair tied into a pigtail and had mysterious blue eyes. He seemed to pier right into Ranma's soul. The boy unnerved him for some reason.</p><p>"Well class I would like to introduce you to Ranma Saotome." The sensai began to get the classes attention. "He has just recently come back from China. So let's all give him a big nihou welcome. Now that the formalities are taken care of the fact that you are new here Mr. Saotome dose not excuse you for being late. Take a pair of buckets and stand in the hall until I call for you."</p><p>Ranma snorted but did as he was told. In truth he felt glad to get out of the class and out of the gaze of the strange boy. After picking up the buckets he left very quickly. Though he tried to leave without looking like he was being intimidated. He was Ranma Saotome after all. The heir to the Saotome School of anything goes martial arts. He could never be intimidated. So why did that boy make him feel so uneasy? A thought that would plague Ranma for the rest of the day.</p><p>Akane watched as Ranma left the classroom. She could not get over the feeling of disgust at the boy. When she had arrived this morning and told Kenchi of the fight he had not reacted favorably. Of coarse she couldn't really blame him. He had told her before that he hated to fight for things like that. That he only fought to protect the ones around him. Yet she had gone behind his back and said that he would fight Ranma.</p><p>Akane hoped that Kenchi would fight though. Just the thought of having to deal with Ranma as a fiancee was giving her the heebee geebee's. She would much rather prefer Kenchi to Ranma any day. Yet if Kenchi would not fight then the problem would be that her engagement to Kenchi would be dissolved and the engagement to Ranma validated. It would be hell on earth. She already knew what kind of boy Ranma was. If he had had the chance he would have probably already forced her into a situation she was not willing to be in.</p><p>Just thinking of what he might have her do sent shivers down her spine. Akane had no intention of ever having sex with Ranma. If it were Kenchi on the other hand that would be a different story. Of coarse he wanted to wait for marriage. However, that needed to wait. Her current problem with Ranma was top priority. How was she going to get him out of her house? Even if Kenchi beat the tar out of Ranma today the pervert would still be staying under the same roof. He would still be able to sneak into her room at night. It was something that she would never tolerate.</p><p>Sneaking a peak towards her preferred fiancee, Akane felt her stomach do flip-flops as it always douse when looking at him. Akane knew that Kenchi could defeat Ranma. Ranma had barely been able to stand up to her, and that was without using any special techniques. How did Ranma even think that he could take her sensai and love? Though the issue was not that Kenchi could defeat Ranma, but would Kenchi even fight Ranma? Akane hoped beyond hope that he would.</p><p>There was another problem to take into consideration with this though. There was no doubt that Ranma was a pervert. An extremely nasty one at that. When Kenchi put the boy in his place, would Ranma try to take his revenge out on her or her sisters? Akane knew boys like Ranma loved to feel superior. Would that make him lash out at her or her sisters when he was defeated? Akane knew she could take care of herself. Yet what of her sisters? She could not be around them twenty four hours a day. How would they be protected from a boy like Ranma? How was she going to stop him from getting back within the house?</p><p>There was another problem as well. What if her father moved the engagement to someone ells. One of her sisters would have to deal with Ranma as a fiancee. That was something that Akane could not let happen. It was a problem in the sense that one way or another they would still have to deal with Ranma. Deal with his being a grade A pervert. Of course, she could ask Kenchi about his ideas on the subject. In fact, that seemed like a perfect idea. She would have to ask about Kenchi's views on the subject at lunch. Hopefully he would have some good ideas; she was certainly out of options.</p><p>When lunchtime came, Akane found Kenchi sitting by their normal spot under the tree out in the back of the school. A place in the wooded area behind the school that they had dedicated for themselves. A place that they found they could talk alone without the interruptions of others. Akane sat down by Kenchi looking at his face as he looked off towards the school.</p><p>"A penny for your thoughts? She asked, a sad smile appearing on her face as she noticed his contemplative manner.</p><p>"Akane, you know when I sit here just listening to the life around me, it makes me wonder. How did I become who I am? What is my purpose in the world? Why do I do what I do? Am I really cut out to be a martial artist? Or should I be something ells?"</p><p>"Why are you asking me this Kenchi?" Akane asked with a sigh. "Is this about the fight that I got you involved with? I know I should have asked you about that first, but as I said this morning, I was pressured into it. Ranma is slime Kenchi. Believe me when I say that to you, please?"</p><p>"Don't worry about that Akane. Though I don't really like it, I will fight Ranma. Although it won't just be for you." When Kenchi noticed Akane's frown, he smirked at her. "Are you going to let me explain that, or are you going to pound me with your mallet here and now Akane?"</p><p>"I don't know Kenchi, maybe I should just get it over with and give you a pounding right here and now. What do you mean your not fighting for me!" Akane asked in a hurt voice.</p><p>"Akane, I said that I'm not fighting just for you. I saw the fight between Ranma and Kuno you know." Kenchi said as he turned to face towards the school again. "I can't get over the way he was fighting. It's as if I know his stile from somewhere. Yet I don't know where." Kenchi said with a sigh.</p><p>"Well you might be thinking of your own school Kenchi. After all both of our schools are somewhat similar in concept."</p><p>"Maybe similar Akane yet there are differences. No, I know that's not it. It's as if I've fought the way he fights. It was like; I already knew all the moves he was going to make without ever seeing him fight. It got me thinking about what my life is. How I came to be in the world of martial arts? Do I do this for myself or just for the family. Is this what I really want?"</p><p>"What did you come up with for an answer Kenchi?" Akane asked in a low tone. She would not like it if the best martial artists that she knew of just up and quit martial arts all together. Her preferred fiancee, friend, and sensai still had a lot to teach.</p><p>"Its not like I'm ready to give up on martial arts Akane, if that's what you're thinking. I just feel kind of like a puppet on a string. It is as if I am not who I really should be. Douse any of this make sense to you?"</p><p>"Not in the least Kenchi. Though you do look cute with your forehead scrunched up like that." Akane said with a smile.</p><p>With a sigh and a smile Kenchi took her hand and kissed it. "You know, I love you right?"</p><p>"Of course, I love you to, you silly baka." She answered back her smile spreading.</p><p>Kenchi smiled back at her his heart beating a mile a minute. "Akane, I have to ask you a very important question. Please take your time in answering me though because I want you to be sure of your answer. Akane, if I beat Ranma this afternoon would you be willing to give up everything for me by the time the fight is over?"</p><p>Before Akane could answer his question, a commotion broke out in the field of Furinkan High. As the two looked over that way from there secret spot, they could hear the sounds of fighting.</p><p>"I wonder who could be fighting now?" Asked Kenchi with a bored tone of voice. "Come on Akane let's go check this out. We might have to put a stop to it before someone gets hurt."</p><p>"If the people fighting are who I think they are I wouldn't mind to see them rough each other up a bit." Akane said in a huff, crossing her arms over her chest in a put off manner.</p><p>"Ahhh don't be like that Akane, you need to remember that you should treat all enemies as though you would treat your friends. You never know when that enemy could turn into a friend after all."</p><p>"Not with these two Kenchi. You know how I feel about Kuno, and, well, Ranma is much the same. The nerve of him to demand my virtue if you lost the duel."</p><p>"What!" Kenchi shouted as he looked in shock at Akane. "What do you mean demanded your virtue if I lost the duel Akane?"</p><p>"Didn't I tell you Kenchi? Akane asked as she looked at him with sad puppy dog eyes. "That was one of the terms the jerk set up. It is made even worse that my father agrees with the terms."</p><p>"Let me get this straight, if I lose the match this afternoon you will have to have sex with Ranma and your father is perfectly acceptable to this arrangement?"</p><p>"That about sums it up." Akane stated her expression relaying what she thought of the idea herself.</p><p>"Tell me something Akane, is your dad completely whacked? I mean who in their right mind would force their daughter to have sex with a stranger over the loss of a fight? It just doesn't make sense to do something like that. I…i…It's so stupid!" Kenchi said while punching the ground with his fist. Of course, he also broke the water main that was buried underneath the ground by doing so. Since distracted as he was he there by changed into his girl form. "Oh this is just perfect." Linchi deadpanned noticing her changed form. "Akane why is it that whenever you are around I seem to be changed into this form more often? It seems that you distract me more times than anyone ells douse."</p><p>Akane smiled at her soaking wet fiancée who was still being drenched by the burst water main. "Come on Linchi let's get out of here and get some hot water for you. After all, I would much rather be with my fiancée Kenchi than his sister Linchi."</p><p>"Oh shut up Akane. Let us first break up that fight before getting me changed back. After all, I'm more of a distraction for Kuno like this."</p><p>With smiles on their faces, the two girls made their way to the fighting duo.</p><p>Earlier Ranma was making his way out of the school, his thoughts on the boy with the blue eyes from class. He had never before felt the way that the boy had made him feel. It was creepy and weird. He was glad the boy had disappeared right at the beginning of lunch. Yet, along with the boy, his erstwhile fiancée had disappeared too.</p><p>Thoughts of what his soon to be fiancee and him would be doing tonight came unbidden to his mind. He giggled as he walked along towards a place he could eat. So caught up in a highly provocative fantasy was he that he did not notice the hakama wearing, boken wielding, idiot in his path.</p><p>"Hey watch it you lout!" Ranma yelled as he bounced off the taller boy.</p><p>"Who are you who speaketh thus to the great Blue Thunder?" Kuno said as he pointed his boken straight at Ranma's throat. Ranma backpedaled from the boy taking a stance while eyeing the boken-wielding idiot.</p><p>"Name's Ranma jerk. Remember it so you can recite it while recovering in the hospital." Ranma smirked at the boy as he began to fume. He could have sworn he actually saw smoke coming out of the boy's ears.</p><p>"I know not who thow arst peasant but know this tis not wise to mock the likes of the Blue Thunder. I shall smite thee for thy transgressions. For I am, might…" Kuno could not continue his long winded speech for Ranma's fist was blocking the movement of his mouth.</p><p>"If you want to fight then shut up and fight fart brains." Ranma said smirking "Otherwise stop wasting my time and get lost."</p><p>"How dare thee!" Kuno stated striking out with a crosscut meant to cut Ranma in half. Ranma dodged the blow, which sliced through a tree behind him. Ranma's eyebrow rose as he noticed the tree fall. It is at this time that Linchi and Akane arrive to stop the fight. Taking complete assessment of the situation, Linchi jumped between the two battling martial artists.</p><p>"Stop this immediately!" She said as she glanced between both fighters. "What is the meaning of this. Don't you know that some people are trying to have a quiet lunch here?" Kuno started to say something but Akane interrupted his speech as she hit him over the head with her mallet.</p><p>"Don't worry Linchi, I'll take care of Kuno here so you can have a nice friendly chat with Ranma." Akane said with a smirk as she dragged Kuno off.</p><p>(Thanks a lot Akane.) Linchi thought sarcastically as she turned to the other boy involved with the brawl. "So you mind telling me what this was all about?" Linchi asked Ranma who was just staring at her, or more correctly staring at her breasts. When he did not answer and just continued to stare at her breasts she began to get a bit ruffled. "Hey pervert I'm talking to you?" Linchi said bopping him on the head with her fist.</p><p>"Big deal, I would rather just enjoy the view." Ranma said continuing to stare at her breasts. He found out the hard way that it was sorely not the best thing to say as he found himself embedded within a wall after Linchi had punched him there. He almost passed out, and would have if the girl did not take him by his shirt holding him above her.</p><p>"Let's get one thing straight pervert. I do not like people leering at my breasts. I hate it when the people leering at my breasts are ignoring me because they are leering at my breasts. So if you want to keep that sorry excuse for a head on your shoulders then you will answer me you dig?" Linchi then threw Ranma to the ground still glaring at him angrily. Ranma shakily stood up not expecting such strength from the small redhead.</p><p>"Uh yeah sure I hear you." Ranma replied shaking the dizziness, he felt from his head. As the dizziness faded, he found himself glaring at the redhead. She was much better than Akane had been he could see that the moment she had punched him into the wall. She had moved with blinding speed and the strength of her punch was unreal. It galled him to no limits that this girl could do that. What made it worse was that if his father found out he was defeated by a girl he would never live it down. Ranma knew that girls were supposed to be weaker than what this girl had shown. It was appalling in and of itself to be defeated in such a way.</p><p>"So now are you going to tell me what happened?" Linchi asked glaring at the boy as if he was some sort of compost heap.</p><p>"It's none of your business really." Ranma replied glaring back at the redhead. "Myself and the idiot were having a man to man discussion. There was no need for you to get involved." Ranma growled to the girl.</p><p>"That's where you are wrong. You see you are scheduled to fight my brother after school today moron, so if you get beat up here you cannot fight him then. I do not want you coping out on a fight because you were hurt. I want to see you get the shit kicked out of you for what you made Akane agree too. It's too bad I won't get to see it." Linchi growled back.</p><p>"So the guy I'm fighting after school is your brother? How convenient, to bad he is the one that will get his clocked cleaned this afternoon." Ranma growled back. "I'm going to enjoy hearing Akane's screams as I take her. I think I'll do it right after your brothers defeat so he can hear as Akane's virginity is lost to a real man." Ranma said smirking not realizing how dangerously close he was coming to losing his head over the comments he was making.</p><p>"My brother will make sure you are put in your place pervert. I wish I could be there to see it happen in person jerk." Linchi growled back barely holding herself back from tossing this pervert to the moon.</p><p>"You seem pretty confident in your brother doncha bitch?" Ranma shot back, not realizing how deep of a hole he was digging for himself.</p><p>"I have the deepest faith in my brother's abilities asshole." Linchi shot right back furiously.</p><p>"Oh, then are you willing to put up a wager on those abilities then?" Ranma asked smirking at her.</p><p>"What sort of wager pervert?" Linchi asked not really liking the look in his eyes.</p><p>"Well it seems that just taking Akane tonight will get a little boring to me. So, how about if we make it a little more interesting. If your brother losses the match this afternoon then you will have to include yourself with Akane and I. A little three way action if you will." Ranma said smirking. "Or are you afraid that your brother might lose?" He asked, his smirk growing larger.</p><p>"You really are a sick basterd, but very well IF my brother losses this afternoon then I will include myself in your little love tryst. However what if my brother wins what will you give up in return?" Linchi asked a twinkle coming to her eye.</p><p>"Not this again!" Ranma said with a grunt. "O.K. how about this, IF I lose I will give up the rights to the dojo to your brother. In other words, he will inherit the dojo no matter who marries the Tendo wenches. Is that enough?" Ranma asked with a deep frown.</p><p>"I don't know really, that seems like a small price to pay when Akane and myself have to give up our virginity's. Don't you think?" Linchi growled at Ranma.</p><p>"Oh I don't know about that. After all, I would be giving up a livelihood. All you and the teas would have to do is spread your legs for me after the match." Ranma said grinning like a shark.</p><p>"Fine I accept, but know this after the match if I see you I will personally make your life a living hell. No matter if you win or lose buttwipe." Linchi shot out as she turned and headed for the school. "Oh you might want to hurry the bell is going to ring soon and I believe you haven't even eaten your lunch." Linchi called over her shoulder.</p><p>With a verbal curse, Ranma realized she was right and hurried to eat his lunch. While Linchi went to find Akane, they had a lot to talk about between them. One of that was weather Akane would mind if she actually killed that egotistical pervert Ranma. She had never met someone so wrong in her life. It took a lot to set off her anger. Well Ranma had succeeded, and when they faced off in the dojo this afternoon, Ranma was going to learn first hand why you never made Kenchi Morisoto mad.</p><p>A.N. Oh My GOD I actually finished this chapter. Will wonders never cease? I decided to wait until next chapter to get to the fight between Ranma and Kenchi. As for what will happen in next chapter well let's just say that Ranma had better have his insurance paid up. Unfortunately he will be getting a little help though. Will Kenchi be able to win in the face of not only Ranma but also Ranma's father, as well as Akane's father. I sure as hell hope so. See you next chapter "For Love and Honor"</p>
