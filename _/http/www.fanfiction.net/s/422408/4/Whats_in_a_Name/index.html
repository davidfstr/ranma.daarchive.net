</div><p>Um do I really need to say this again oh well, these  characters are not mine. They belong to the wonderful  lady who created them. They are also distributed by VIZ Video. I am not and  will not gain any money by writing this story. This story is just being written  for fun that is all.</p><p>OK here it is the main draft of chapter 4. There may still  be errors in here that were not caught though. I still haven't gone through all  my prereaders suggestions.  Boy did I get a lot of requests for this chapter.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>For Love and Honor.</b></p><p> For the rest of the school day Ranma sat in  his seat tuning out the monotone voice of his teacher. He had spent most of the  time caught up in dreams of his night with Akane and Linchi. How he would get  the pleasures he deserved from them. Not like that stupid amazon. She would not  give it up until he was truly married to the girl. As if! As if he would marry  some backwater hick from a backwater village, which had stupid laws to begin  with. Ranma hated the fact that his father had even listened to the guide who  had brought them to the stupid village in the first place. What a load of bull  that was. He was just thankful he would never have to deal  with her again. She had been a major disappointment in her breaking. Too  bad, there was no sex involved with what had happened. Well turning into a boy  after the match did help to lessen the severity of the situation for him at  least. Imagine having to hunt down a girl that had beaten you. It was stupid. Of  course slapping him when he got fresh with her was uncalled for in his view. He  had given her a great lesson though. She got what she deserved in spades.</p><p>Rattled  from his thoughts as the bell rang to signal the end of class, Ranma looked up spotting the other students leaving the  classroom. Looking at his schedule, he saw that gym was his next class. Ranma  got up from his desk and followed some other boys to the boys' locker room,  where they changed into their gym cloths and proceeded to the athletic field.</p><p>As the  gym teacher was explaining the fundamentals of bar gymnastics, Ranma casually  looked over to where the girls were playing a game of softball. He smirked at  the skimpy red bloomers they wore with the white tops. He saw Akane on the  field, and his smirk grew thinking of her in less than she had on now. He new  he would get to see her later like that once he beat his supposed rival. Oh how  he was going to enjoy her screams when he broke her. Her and that little tart  of a sister of Akanes' alleged fiancee.</p><p>Ranma  came back to reality from his erotic daydreams when the gym teacher called for  him for his turn on the bar. He quickly mounted the bar and performed a simple  routine flawlessly, then ended with a skillful dismount. Afterwards he sat back  down in the same spot to continue his watch of the girls in their short  bloomers and white tees. He came out of his daydreams again as a couple of his  classmates sat down with him and started talking.</p><p>"Wow  that was great!" The boy on his right said as he sat down.</p><p>"Of  course it was great Diasuke, I heard that Ranma hear went over seas to study  gymnastics." The other boy responded confidently.</p><p>"It  was Kempo, not gymnastics." Ranma replied in a  board tone. He sighed then turned back to his girl watching.</p><p>"So  who're checking out Ranma?" The boy named Diasuke asked as he looked to  where Ranma was watching the girls play ball. Seeing Akane catch a pop fly out  of the air, he smirked while saying. "I wouldn't get your hopes up if  you're planning on going after Akane. It is impossible to separate her from  that boyfriend of hers. I hear now that she is even engaged to him."</p><p>"Yeah,  what a shame that such a girl is taken off the market like that. Her fiancee is  sure one lucky bastard."</p><p>"You  said it Hiroshi. It's too bad that we couldn't win a date with her."</p><p>"Win  a date with her?" Ranma asked turning away from watching the game, as  Akane stepped up to bat.</p><p>"Yeah,  it only lasted for a day until her boyfriend stopped it by beating the crap out  of the instigator." Hiroshi replied getting a vacant look to his eyes as  he remembered that time.</p><p>Ranma  was about to ask more when there was a loud crack then a stinging sensation on  his cheek. He just blinked for a second before saying, "Owe!"</p><p>"Hey  Ranma if your supposed to be this hotshot martial artist, couldn't you have  caught or dodged that."</p><p>With a  sigh, Ranma replied. "I was distracted." Then he looked to where  Akane was looking in their direction with a shocked look on her face. His  thoughts turned to how much he was going to enjoy breaking her. Indeed, he was  going to make sure she felt every single second of what was coming to her.</p><p>On her  way home, Akane was deep in thought over the events of gym class. She felt bad  for what she accidentally did to Ranma. She wondered why he just did not just  dodge the ball. Dismissing those thoughts, she turned them to a more pleasant  topic, Kenchi. He was supposed to meet her at the dojo in an hour. It would  give him time to prepare and Ranma time to visit Dr. Tofu. She didn't know why  Nabiki had insisted that he go to the doctor's. All he had was  a little boo boo on his cheek. The bruise on his cheek was nothing to worry  about. It wasn't like it was going to hinder him in any way. Though she  supposed Nabiki had her reasons for what she did. Akane knew that Nabiki  detested the pervert so it wasn't like she was in love with the jerk.</p><p>As she  neared the gates to the dojo Akane took a deep breath. She was not anticipating  the confrontation that was about to take place. She had avoided her father this  morning yet she knew that she was going to be in for an earful when she got  home.</p><p>When  she got through the door to the house, just as she had predicted, her father was waiting for her.</p><p>"So  Akane, have you brought this challenger home with you?" Soun asked in a  huff.</p><p>"He  will be here in an hour father." She replied while taking her shoes  off.  She then proceeded past her father  and made her way towards the kitchen to talk to Kasumi. She had no wish to talk  to her father right now.</p><p>"He  should be here now Akane." Her father grumbled as he followed her towards  the kitchen. "If he were responsible he would not have left your side. It  would be his duty to take care of you. Yet, he would leave you alone to walk to  your house. Why, in my day…"</p><p>"In  your day father, men took their women by the hair and drag them off to their  caves." Akane said in a huff walking through the door to the kitchen while her  father fumed at her back.</p><p>"That  wasn't a very nice thing to say Akane." Her sister replied as she walked in to  the kitchen.</p><p>"He  should not have confronted me then Kasumi. Father must understand that I will  not live under his boot. I can't believe he wants to still argue about me not  wanting to marry Ranma. He automatically discredits Kenchi even though he  hasn't even met him."</p><p>"Akane  you must remember that father has his own plans for the school. It was his  dream for one of us to marry a Saotome. For you to marry another takes away  that dream since it was deemed that you would be the heir to the dojo."</p><p>"I  don't know Kasumi; he should still understand that I don't want to be handed  off like some piece of meat. I love daddy dearly, yet doing this to us is  uncalled for. He should have at least told us before what he was planning. Then  we could have at least discussed it properly. However, he just dumps this on us  the day we were supposed to meet our potential husband. Then after we get to  know the boy and see how much of a pervert the boy really is, daddy practically  has me thrown in bed with him. How could he even suggest that it would be all  right for me to give up my virtue like that? Tell me that Kasumi?"</p><p>Kasumi  sighed then turned from cutting the vegetables.   Looking her little sister in the eyes, she responds with a shrug. "I am  not saying I agree with father, Akane. I am saying you should be more civil  towards him. I agree that this was a bad choice,  however, you must still realize that he had reacted properly since mothers  death. I know you don't remember much from that time, but father wants us to be  the image of mother…"</p><p>"We  discussed this last night Kasumi. Daddy wants us to be his twisted idea of what  mother was, not what she truly was. We are not fragile little damsels Kasumi.  We are independent as mother was independent. He should realize that, and stop  trying to turn us in to little maiden robots."</p><p>"Akane  I'm sure we can eventually get father to come around. You must understand  though that continually harassing him will not benefit your cause."</p><p>"Maybe  you're right Kasumi. I do not want to really distance myself from him but I  will not turn from my principles. I just hope Kenchi takes care of Ranma in a  hurry so we can be rid of that trouble."</p><p>"I do  hope your young man can take care of this little sister."</p><p>"Don't  worry about that, all Kenchi will have to do is use one of his special  techniques and this contest will be all but over." Akane smiled and sighed at  the thought of Kenchi blasting Ranma from the dojo with a flick of his wrist.  Unnoticed by both the girls there was a rustling by the door to the kitchen.</p><p>Soun's  face grew somber as he walks to the patio. He gazes over the yard taking in the  view of his home. The dojo was his dream since he was a little boy. He could  remember those days as if they were in a fog now. It was so long ago. Sitting  with his father as the man taught him the values of life. It was a time before  he met his best friend. Before the master and the troubles the old man brought  with him. It was a time of innocence. A time of real foolishness that could  only come with youth. His daughter was going through such a time now. Even  worse she is dragging Kasumi down with her. How dare she try to change Kasumi  into some independent thinker? Women had their place. That place was in the  house taking care of their husbands and children. Kasumi was on the right path.  It was his other two daughters that need to learn their place. Akane most of  all needed to know that the world would not see her as a man would be seen.</p><p>"What's  on your mind old friend?" Soun looked up into the solemn face of his old friend  Genma Saotome. He was in his usual off white gie with a bandanna covering his  baldhead. His friend sat down beside him looking out across the yard.</p><p>"I just  don't understand Saotome. Why do children have to be so complicated? Why won't  my daughter except her place and do as I wish? It is just so complicated  sometimes my friend."</p><p>"You  have to understand the younger generation my friend. It will be O.K. after my  boy beats her other suitor she will be put within her place. Right now she  thinks she knows all because the young always do. It is a failing with them.  They always want to be rebellious. All you have to remember is that discipline  is the key. Make her stand by her word when she tries to turn away from her  word this afternoon. Who knows maybe we will have an heir sooner than we  planned if all goes as planned this evening."</p><p>Soun  smiled at the thought. "You know how to truly cheer me up Saotome my friend.  Are you sure that your boy will be able to beat this upstart?"</p><p>"I have  no worries about that Tendo. Even if the boy has trouble with this so called  martial artist I have a few ideas to help out."</p><p>"I do  hope so Saotome. This is the culmination of all we have suffered for all our  lives. I heard my daughter talking about the boy knowing special techniques.  Will that be a problem Saotome?"</p><p>"Hmm,  it might be Tendo. I haven't had the time to teach Ranma any of the higher  techniques of our school. We will have to make sure that this boy can't use  these techniques of his then. Somehow we will have to level the playing field  in our favor. We will make sure that my boy will win and then the future of our  schools will be secured."</p><p>"Yes  Saotome we must make sure that the school comes first. Nothing will stand in  our way!"</p><p>The two  stood up laughing heartily saying, "Its operation gets Ranma and Akane together  tonight." They then sat back down and began pondering about the upcoming  events. They pondered the events that would affect the outcome of the Tendo  Dojo's future, and the future of its younger inhabitants.</p><p>At the  same time as the discussion occurring in the back yard patio of the Tendo Dojo,  Nabiki was leading Ranma towards the local medical  clinic. As they walked Nabiki shook her head at the grumbling Ranma. "You know  Ranma you have nothing to complain about. It was your own fault you were hit by  that ball."</p><p>"Be  quiet! What do you know about it anyway? I was humiliated in front of the whole  school. I will tell you this Nabiki that sister of yours will get what's coming  to her tonight."</p><p>"I  wouldn't be so sure of that Ranma. By this time tomorrow you will probably be  back out on the road."</p><p>"Ha! As if anyone around here can really beat me."</p><p>"It  seems that Linchi was tossing you around pretty easily earlier Ranma. So I  wouldn't be so cocky."</p><p>"I  would be careful Nabiki. One would think you care for me. Of course who  wouldn't care for a hunk like me right?"</p><p>"Ranma,  you have nothing to offer me. I am just making sure you can't get out of this  honor fight because of that bruise on your face. I want to make sure you can't  weasel your way out of this. It is important to both our families. Once you are  out of the house I won't have to worry about you any more."</p><p>Ranma  grabbed Nabiki by the arm turning her to face him. "Watch yourself Nabiki or I  might just think that you need as much of a lessen as  your dike of a sister."</p><p>Ranma  could swear he could feel a chill go up his spine from the frosty glare Nabiki  was giving him. She looked from his face to his hand that was painfully holding  her arm. "I will warn you once again Saotome and this is the final time. Do not  threaten us. To not try anything with us that you can't finish. Do not mess  with my family. Last of all do not mess with me. If you do, I will make your  life such a hell you will wish for death to escape it. I suggest you also take  your hands off me before you find you will have to forfeit your fight this  afternoon."</p><p>"Oh,  what do you think you can do to me?"</p><p>Nabiki  looked coolly into his smirking face and replied. "Not me Saotome them." It was at this time that Ranma  noticed the crowd that had surrounded them. A crowd that had frowns on their  faces, and a promise of pain in their eyes. It was especially apparent in the  females of the crowd. Though Ranma knew he could probably take all these people  he didn't want to risk getting hurt in the process, and in doing so missing the  fight. With a "Humph!" Ranma let go of Nabiki's arm;  she turned and began walking again. Ranma followed the older schoolgirl  scowling at her back. She turned into a simple building opening the door and  calling out "Hello! Dr. Tofu, are you in?"</p><p>Ranma  looked around as Nabiki continued to call out for the Doctor. He stopped  looking around when a handsome man walked into the room. He looked to be in his  early to mid twenties. He wore a brown gi and had  round glasses. His hair was clean cut and parted down the middle.</p><p>"Why hello Nabiki. How can I help you today?"</p><p>"I  would like you to have a look at this boy here if you could." She said waving  her hand toward Ranma haphazardly. "He is scheduled for an honor fight this  afternoon that we would like to make sure that he doesn't have to forfeit. It  has to do with the possible marriage of one of us Tendo girls to him."</p><p>"Marriage?" He asked getting a fearful look in his eyes. "Marriage to whom?"</p><p>Nabiki  got a speculative look on her face looking at the good doctor. "Any one of us actually. He is dueling with Akane's current  fiancée, and if he wins he will be able to choose between the three of us."</p><p>"Between the three of you?"</p><p>"Yeah,  I get to get some good tail out of this." Ranma put in flippantly smirking at  Nabiki, missing the dark look he received from the doctor. Nabiki did not miss  the look though, and did not like the way the doctor was eyeing the pervert.  She knew she would have to nip this in the bud or Ranma would not make it to  the duel. That was something she did not want to happen as Ranma might say that  he was set up. She wanted to make sure everything was on the up and up with  this fight so Ranma could find no way to get back into their lives. Once Kenchi  beat the living stuffing out of Ranma then she would let the good doctor have  the rest of him. Until then she would have to keep the good doctor under  control.</p><p>"Ranma  here believes that he will beat Akane's current Fiancee easily but we want to  make sure he is in perfect health before the fight so he will not cop out or  anything. You understand right doctor?"</p><p>Dr.  Tofu turned from them and proceeded to the back room. "Follow me and we will  see about that bruise on your face."</p><p>As  Ranma sat on the table Nabiki followed the doctor as he went to get his  supplies. As the doctor took down the first of his supplies Nabiki spoke up.  "Dr. Tofu I know what you are thinking and I ask you not to do anything."</p><p>"What  do you mean Nabiki?" He asked calmly.</p><p>"I know  how you feel and I share your sentiments, but let us handle this first. If  Ranma does not fight with Akane's fiancée fairly then he could make our lives  miserable. This would make her life miserable. Do you want that Doctor? We need  him to make this fight doctor so you make sure he can in the best health he can  be in."</p><p>"Nabiki  I'm a doctor, and as a doctor I have my principles."</p><p>"Principles  you seem to forget at times when she is brought into the equation doctor."</p><p>"You  heard him how he was talking. What he could do!"</p><p>"Please  stop and think about that doctor. If you act now you will put her in more  danger, then what will your sense to protect be worth?  Leave this be doctor, just treat Ranma's little boo-boo and let us walk out of  here. No tricks, no pressure points that will disable him. Do you understand  doctor?"</p><p>"How  can you be so calm about this Nabiki? I can tell just by being around that boy  that he is trouble. I will not let him get near…"</p><p>"Ranma  will get what he has coming to him doctor. If you do what you are supposed to  do and just fix him up. Do not do anything stupid doctor."</p><p>With a  sigh Doctor Tofu nodded and turned towards the patient area where Ranma was  waiting.  "He had just better watch  himself." The doctor whispered as he walked over to the table. "Here  Ranma let me take a look at that wound." Dr. Tofu stripped the bandage  that was on Ranma's face off, making Ranma wince in the process.</p><p>"So  Doc how well do you know the Tendo's?"</p><p>"I  have been taking care of the Tendo family for many years. I have grown very attached to them. You could say they are like a second  family to me."</p><p>"Hmm,  so have you gotten a piece of one of the sister's ass then?"</p><p>The  young doctor just stood there looking at the obstinate boy in front of him. He  was using every ounce of his control not to tear the boy to pieces right at  that moment.</p><p>"Come on Doc tell me, have  you been muff diving while giving any one of the sisters an examination, or  have you had any of them polish the old torpedo?"</p><p>"Ranma  your wound is fine. I give you a full bill of health. I suggest you leave now.  You don't want to be late to your challenge now do  you?"</p><p>"Yeah  I guess your right Doc. Though honestly Doc, how far have you gotten with the  three Tendo daughters?"</p><p>"Ranma  I suggest we go now." Nabiki commented hearing what Ranma was asking of  the poor doctor. Noting the murderous intention that was in his eyes she  believed the best thing to do now was to get Ranma as far away from Dr. Tofu as  possible. Though she couldn't blame him for his thoughts, she still needed the  pervert for the fight.</p><p>"Here  I will escort you out."</p><p>"No  need Dr. Tofu we can find our own way." Nabiki commented getting  in-between the two. She knew that if the doctor were to close to the pervert he  would be too tempted to try something.</p><p>"Well,  if you need anything just ask."</p><p>"We  will Dr. Tofu." Nabiki commented leading, or rather pushing Ranma out of  the clinic. She did not miss the hidden meaning in the statement, nor did she  miss the glare to Ranma's back. It was lucky for him that she needed him for  the fight or she would have left him to the mercies of the good doctor in an  instant. She just hoped that Akane's faith in her fiancee is justified. She  didn't want to deal with this pervert any more than she had to.</p><p>After  getting Ranma out of the clinic, Nabiki quickly proceeded to the dojo. Right  now, all she wanted was for Ranma to get his head handed to him on a silver  plate. The sooner this was over with the sooner she could continue with her  life without the possibility of a marriage in the near future. As they neared  the dojo, Nabiki noticed Akane waiting outside the front gate. She was dressed  in a silk, long sleeved yellow top with light blue pants. The pants were tied  off at the ankles just above her slipper feet. Nabiki could tell she had also  put on a bit of makeup as well.</p><p>"Why  so dressed up Akane?" She asked walking up to her sister, a smile  decorating her face.</p><p>"Daddy's  idea actually." replied the younger Tendo sister. "He actually wanted  me to be in a wedding dress, but I quickly persuaded him otherwise."  Turning her attention to Ranma, she asked. "So is the pervert good enough  to fight?"</p><p>Ranma  scowled at the girl in front of him replying. "You bet I'm good enough.  You just be ready for after the match when you won't have to really worry about  clothes at all. Though I must admit that that garment suits you well for your  last few hours as a virgin."</p><p>Akane's  face grew dark as she clenched her fists at her side. "I will enjoy seeing  you beaten to a pulp Saotome. Make no mistake about it you will be beaten, and  beaten severely. My fiancée is the best Martial Artist around. He will make you  wish you had never set foot in Nerima by the time he is done with you."</p><p>"I  guess we'll see about that huh?  Once I  beat him and that sister of his shows up, I will enjoy my bounty from this  fight." Ranma went in the gates after saying that leaving two angry girls  glaring after him.</p><p>"You  know I have never really hated anyone before, that pervert is the first. It's  amazing how he ever got to live up to sixteen."</p><p>"Don't  let him get to you Akane. If you are right about your fiancee then we have  nothing to worry about, as long as he can deliver. You are not just boasting  are you? We are risking a lot on this fight. If Ranma should win then not only  can you say farewell to your virginity, but Kasumi and I will also be put at  risk with Ranma living in the house at all times."</p><p>"You  don't have to worry Nabiki; Kenchi will take care of Ranma. I am definitely not  boasting about his skills. I have seen him in action, and I know he has trained  under some of the best Martial Arts masters available today. I have faith in  him Nabiki as should you."</p><p>"Unlike  you dear sister I don't have the information on him that you have. Remember I  have only seen him fight against the likes of Kuno a few times. Most of those  fights ended too fast to see any real skill. It was mostly just a punch to the  face and the idiot was out for the count while traveling across Nerima via low  earth orbit. Most of the time it isn't even Kenchi that sends the jerk into  la-la land, but you dear little sister."</p><p>"Actually Kenchi sees Kuno as a good training dummy for me.  Kuno never really fights me full out true but Kenchi rates my strength on how  far I can hit Kuno in the mornings. He wouldn't even let me hit Kuno like that  if the pervert couldn't take it. It took a couple of weeks to condition him to  be able to take hits like that."</p><p>"You  mean you have actually been training Kuno!"</p><p>"Of course!  Who  else would I spar with? No one around here is even close to the level that  Kenchi has made me achieve. Ranma has actually been the most challenge for me  in a long time. I would really enjoy having him around if it wasn't for his  girls are only to be used for sex toys attitude. For all his boasting, he can  fight quite well. He is not at the same level as Kenchi of course, but compared  to me he would make an excellent sparring partner. It is really too bad that he  is such a bully though. He has the potential to be a great Martial Artist yet  he squanders his talent and forsakes the code. The art is not used for ones own  gain it is used to protect the weak and helpless. A Martial Artist protects  family honor and the honor of those around him. Even then, a martial artist  doses what is right. Someone like Ranma will use the art for his own benefit.  All he wants out of the art is to be the best, and to bully those beneath his  skill. It is someone like him that gives the art a bad name."</p><p>"Well  said," came a reply from behind the two girls, making them both jump in  surprise.</p><p>"Kenchi!" Akane called out giving him the biggest glomp of his life.  Then stepping back and slapping him.</p><p>"What  was that for?" Kenchi asked stepping back from the girl he wished to  marry.</p><p>"That  was for scaring me half to death just now. This on the other hand is for being  here." She replied jumping towards him and planting her lips to his.</p><p>How  long the liplock would have continued will always remain unknown as Nabiki interrupted  the couple before they could continue any further. "Come on Akane you  shouldn't do that in public. It is kind of embarrassing throwing yourself at  him like a cat in heat."</p><p>Akane  stepped back from Kenchi as blushes enveloped both their faces. "We had  better hurry and get inside. The others are waiting for us and we don't want to  be late." She said in a rush pulling Kenchi inside the gate.  With a sigh, and wondering how her sister  could be so lucky for the thousandth time, Nabiki followed.</p><p>Akane led  Kenchi inside the house pausing only to remove her slippers, and to allow  Kenchi to remove his before dragging him further into the house.  She led him into the dining room where they  found Kasumi and her father sitting sipping tea. "Father I would like you to  meet the man I wish to marry, Morisoto Kenchi. Kenchi this is my family, Kasumi  my older sister," Kenchi looked over to the older girl bowing in greeting. "You  have already met Nabiki," Kenchi smiled at the girl who walked in, also giving  her a curt bow. "Finally this is my father Tendo Soun."</p><p>Kenchi  bowed to the patriarch of the Tendo house. He then produced a bottle from  seemingly nowhere, and presented it to the older man. "It is an honor for you  to invite me into your house Mr. Tendo. Please accept this as a token of my  gratitude."</p><p>Soun  took the offered bottle, inspecting it. What he found made his eyes go wide.  The bottle was a very expensive brand of sake, in fact it was a brand only  bought by those very well off. "Well son this is a very fine gift. However, we  should get down to the business at hand. I am sure that you are aware that  Akane is to be wed to the son of a good friend of mine. She has been promised  since before she was born to this marriage to unite the Tendo and Saotome  schools of Anything Goes Martial Arts, formally Indiscriminate Grappling."</p><p>"I am  aware that a daughter of the Tendo family has been promised into this marriage  yes. However, having spoken to both my potential fiancée and the boy you wish her to marry, we have decided on an honor fight to  decide if this is to continue."</p><p>Soun  looked the boy over carefully as he stood there calmly. The boy was dressed in  a red long sleeved Chinese shirt with Chinese dragons embroidered up the sides.  He wore black drawstring pants tied off at the ankles, that didn't hide the  corded muscles of his legs. He also wore two black bracers on his wrists that  seemed to mach the ones on Akane's wrists yet bigger to accommodate his size.  His face seemed kind and wholesome while his blue eyes radiated piece and  tranquility. He had dark black hair that was braided down his back. The boy  seemed to be a good choice as a potential husband for Akane, yet he could not  let his dreams go. She had to marry Ranma and unite the schools. It has been  his dream since the day both he and Saotome had taken care of the master.</p><p>"Oh my,  shouldn't we head out to the dojo father?"</p><p>"Yes,  yes.  I'm sorry, let's get this over  with, shall we?" Soun got up and proceeded to walk out past the shoji, he led  the group down the walkway and into the dojo where the Saotomes were waiting.  The two of them were talking as the group entered.</p><p>Ranma  looked towards the door as Mr. Tendo walked in. He and his father were going  over strategies on how to handle the fight. For some reason the old man thought  that the challenge would be a problem. It wasn't as if his rival could beat  him. So what if he had been resilient in the fight this morning, in that fight  he had been a girl. In this fight he would be a guy so it shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>As the  patriarch of the Tendo clan stepped into the dojo Ranma was surprised to see  not the Kuno boy he was expecting, but the boy with the blue eyes from class  that had given him the chills before. He could still feel the power in those  eyes even now. By the boy's side in came Akane and after them her sisters.  Ranma was still surprised at not seeing the boy he was expecting to see when he  asked.</p><p>"Hey  where is that Kuno guy I'm supposed to be fighting?"</p><p>"What  are you talking about? You're supposed to fight Kenchi,  my fiancée, Ranma, not Kuno. What gave you the idea that you were going to  fight Kuno?"</p><p>"The  idiot said he was the one that was your champion that's why. So where is he?"</p><p>"He is  probably at home trying to figure out a new plan to defeat Kenchi, and going on  about how he was robbed of his right to date the fair Akane and his Red haired  goddess Linchi." Nabiki commented as she sat in her place to watch the upcoming  fight.</p><p>"Oh my! Is he that boy that was causing all that trouble  before for Akane?"</p><p>"That's  him sis. I remember when he used to follow you around school all the time too."</p><p>"He  never did get the hint that I was never interested in him. He was such an  immature boy if I remember him right. Oh young men are just so young." Kasumi  commented shaking her head and earning sweat drops from those around her.</p><p>"Well  yes, anyway let's get this mach over with shall we?" Soun spoke up gaining the  attention of the occupants of the dojo. "This fight is of course to see who  will be the one to marry Akane and inherit the dojo. This is to be a battle of  skill so there is to be no special techniques and such." This earned a glare  from Akane while Kenchi and Ranma just shrugged. The rule didn't mean much to  both as Kench was out to teach Ranma a lesson, and Ranma was determined to use  any means necessary to win anyway.  Ranma  knew that he would just have to keep the tricks he planned to use more hidden  that was all. It didn't matter though as his old man had taught him many things  on how to win a fight. He would have liked to see what this Kenchi had though.  Kenchi on the other hand knew what he was facing and didn't see a problem with  the outcome of this fight. In terms of skill he knew he way outclassed Ranma.  He could see it in the way Ranma moved and held himself. Ranma did have  potential though. It was something he would have to look into once this was  taken care of. His attitude would have to be adjusted as well or he wouldn't  get very far in life as it was.</p><p>"Does  each of you understand the terms I have laid out before you?" Soun looked at  each boy verifying they understood. With a nod he led them to the center of the  dojo where they each took their positions to the left and right of him. With  another nod Soun held up his hand, and with a quick swipe brought his hand down  as he stepped away from the two boys.</p><p>Ranma  quickly took to the air, as air combat was the specialty of the Saotome   School. However as he brought his  leg into position for a leaping kick he found himself passing through the image  of Kenchi. Ranma quickly readjusted himself trying to get his bearings on his  elusive opponent. Kenchi he found was standing behind him smirking.</p><p>"You  will have to be faster than that Ranma." With a frown Ranma leapt towards him  with a quick jab that should have landed on Kenchi's face. Though Ranma was  sure that his punch was heading for the other boy's face he found no  resistance. He kept up the jabs yet each time it seemed as if he was punching  air. Ranma backed off from the attack eyeing the boy in front of him with a  wary expression on his face. It seemed that this Kenchi was a bit better than  he thought. It didn't matter, all the boy was doing was acting defensively he  just needed to figure out how this Kenchi was avoiding his punches.</p><p>"You  won't win this fight you know. I will take Akane and that little tart of a  sister of yours and really be enjoying myself after I defeat you."</p><p>"You  really think you will win Ranma?" Kenchi asked crossing his arms across his  chest. "You haven't shown me anything yet that has given you an advantage in  this fight. This isn't even a proper warm up."</p><p>With a  growl Ranma again leaped at Kenchi again leading off  with a punch yet changing that punch into a grab trying to latch on to the  elusive boy in front of him. He was surprised, as he seemed to pass through  where Kenchi was supposed to be. No one he knew of could move that fast, not  even that Amazon hussy he had beaten, and she was fast. It looked like he would  have to use the same tactics here that he used in the Amazon   Village.</p><p>Reaching  into his shirt, Ranma pulled out a small clear vile  containing a white powdery substance. He turned to face Kenchi concealing the  vile within his shirtsleeve for easy access. He then stood and waited for  Kenchi to attack, as he could not get close to the martial artist otherwise.</p><p>Kenchi  watched Ranma carefully as he turned.  He  saw Ranma put something up his sleeve and became even  more cautious.  He could not get over the  feeling that Ranma was up to something. It was in the moves that he made. The  expressions on his face as he attacked were of determination and it seemed to  spark something from within. That feeling that he had been in the same  situation as Ranma but on opposite ends was dominant in his mind. As though he  had faced this sort of battle where he was the cocky infant that thought he was  the best of all martial artists of his generation. Yet, as Cologne  had taught him, being the best is not in just winning battles. The best knows  when to battle and when not to battle.</p><p>As Ranma  recovered from his impromptu attack Kenchi watched as he took a loose stance as  if he was just standing watching the other casually. The stance fooled Kenchi  as much as a vacuum salesman can fool a car salesman. In other words Ranma  wasn't fooling Kenchi at all with the deceptive stance.</p><p>"You  know Ranma…" Kenchi started also taking a relaxed stance. "It may be better for  you if you concede this contest now. Though I hope you don't as I wish to show  you just how pathetic you are."</p><p>"I'll  show you whose pathetic loser!" Instead of taking to the air as he had done  previously Ranma rolled into a kick intending to strike the elusive martial  artist in the groin. Again, he came up striking air as Kenchi  seemed to dance around him. With a frustrated growl he turned towards Kenchi  again striking for a sensitive area on the body. Again he failed to connect. As  he took a step back Ranma knew he was in more trouble than he had originally  thought. The boy was just too fast to hit. It was humiliating the way he was dancing  around making him look like a fool. The damn asshole wasn't even attacking just  dodging everything thrown his way as if he was so superior that he wasn't worth  his time. Ranma smirked as he thought of something that might be able to get  the faggot where he needed him. This was anything goes after all so who says  that he couldn't use anything at his disposal.</p><p>Ranma  again took to the air, however instead of aiming a punch at Kenchi his strike  went for Kasumi who was sitting over to the side. Kenchi saw Ranma's move and  moved to counter the strike. It angered him that Ranma would involve an  innocent in their fight. As Kenchi caught Ranma's arm though, Ranma turned and  let the vile hidden in his sleeve fly also popping the cork at the top. A white  powder seemed to fly out towards Kenchi and would have made contact with him if  Kenchi had not noticed the move and removing his hand from Ranma's arm glided  out of the way of the powder that seemed to be aimed for his eyes.</p><p>When he  heard a scream of pain Kenchi turned to see that some of the powder had gotten  on Kasumi's arm touching the skin of her wrist. The skin where the powder  touched was burning. Quickly Kenchi made his way towards the girl in a flash.  Being careful not to touch the sleeve with the powder on it he quickly used he  ki to minimize the pain that was making the girl scream. He tore off the sleeve  of her dress from the elbow down making sure that anymore of the powder did not  come in contact with her skin. He then applied more ki to the burns on her  wrist making them all but disappear. It was made easier as not much of the  powder had touched her.</p><p>Through  with helping Kasumi, Kenchi turned towards Ranma who seemed to be looking for  something again inside his shirt. Throwing the sleeve in his hands away Kenchi  jumped to the attack. He took Ranma by the throat lifting him into the air.</p><p>"How  dare you use a chemical like that? Do you realize that you could have  permanently scarred Ms. Kasumi with the burns that it causes? It wasn't Ms.  Kasumi that you were aiming for though was it? You were aiming for my eyes. If  you had been successful in getting that stuff in my eyes I would have been  blinded for life!" Kenchi then reared back and punched Ranma clear across the  dojo. Quickly following the boy he proceeded to work Ranma over putting a  bruise on every inch of his body.</p><p>On the  sidelines Genma was worried, it was apparent that his son was losing this  battle, and losing badly. The other boy was just too good for him. He saw that  when the boy had healed Kasumi's burns that the boy had excellent control over  his ki. To make burns just up and vanish like that was amazing. Genma was no  fool when it came to noticing the potential of fighters. He knew when someone  was outclassed, and his boy was way outclassed. He needed a way to help the  boy, or they would lose everything that he had spent years working for. His  life would again return to the road having to work everyday for survival. He  wouldn't be able to mooch off his friend as he had planned to do when he came  here. Genma glanced over to his friend and saw the hard stare that he was  giving to his son. Genma had to admit it was careless of the boy to throw the  white powder and hit one of Soun's daughters. Genma knew though that Soun  wanted the marriage of both their families. It was probably why he wasn't up  screaming at his boy. Still he needed a way to help Ranma or he would lose. He  knew of one technique that might be able to help, but he had vowed long ago  never to use those techniques again. As he saw his son once again get battered  across the dojo he made his decision. Taking a peculiar stance he seemed to  vanish from sight unnoticed by the other occupants of the dojo except one.</p><p>While  Kenchi was turning Ranma into bloody goop he noticed one of the ki signatures  of the dojo seem to disappear. He was about to finish Ranma off and look into  this more when pain began to flair up his back. With a cry of pain Kenchi  kicked out seemingly at nothing.</p><p>The  other occupants of the dojo looked at the boy strangely as he seemed to kick  and punch at thin air ignoring Ranma who could barely stand as it was. They saw  that he was about to finish the other boy off when a painful expression came  over his face. Now he seemed to be going crazy attacking at nothing.</p><p>Kenchi  knew that the one causing the pain was around somewhere he just had to find  him. He reached out with his senses trying to identify where the bastard was.  As more pain seemed to flare up his back Kenchi felt it, or more accurately  didn't feel it. In fact he didn't feel anything. It was as if a hole had opened  up in a certain spot. It was a hole of nothingness that seemed to push all  senses away from that spot. Concentrating on the nothingness while stopping his  mad attacks he calmed himself. He had to stop the one that was doing the attack  yet he needed to keep his cool as his masters had instructed him many times  before. He felt that the nothingness was again moving behind him before the  attack could occur he leapt towards a recovering Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  saw the attack coming just as Kenchi wanted him to and leapt to counterattack.  The counterattack failed as Kenchi seemed to blur out of the way again however,  Ranma felt his fist strike flesh he also felt painful strikes to his chest  making him cry out as his body fell into whoever was punching him. Then Kenchi  was there again laying punch after punch into him. He felt his teeth loosen at  a particularly hard punch to the face. Soon after he felt the coppery taste of  his blood as it went down his throat from the cut to his inner cheek.</p><p>The  others were surprised as Ranma seemed to collide with something in mid-air as Kenchi seemed to blur out of the way. They then watched as  Kenchi again began to lay onto him and whoever it was  that Ranma had run into. To their surprise Genma appeared black and blue from  many hard hits. Kenchi stopped his attack and with a roundhouse kick, and with a  "Kia!" sent both Saotomes  through the dojo wall and straight into the koi pond. Where a panda and a badly  beaten girl floated on there backs unconscious.</p><p>With a  sigh Kenchi turned to the Tendo patriarch and bowed saying. "I believe that is  match, sir." In shock, Soun nodded to the boy not  able to say anything as his dreams of uniting the two anything goes schools  went down the toilet. He was being torn apart. While one part of him wanted to  go and rip both boys to shreds for even daring to involve Kasumi in the fight,  another part was thankful she was alright. In the course of most of the fight  his mind had simply shut down. Even now he could hardly think on what to do.</p><p>With a  yelp of joy Akane was by Kenchi's side in an instant giving him the glomp of  his life. He just smiled and wrapped his arms around the excited girl hugging  her warmly.</p><p>"Remind  me sis that when you say someone will come through to listen. That was some  fight; I wish I could have sold tickets." Nabiki said walking up to the pair.  Luckily, she had taped the whole thing though. It should bring in quite a  profit for her if she could market it right.</p><p>Kasumi  was the next to speak walking up next to Nabiki. "Thank you for stopping the  burning Kenchi-san that had hurt a lot."</p><p>"I am  just glad that the powder did not get anywhere else on your skin. That type of  chemical has a tendency to be very nasty. That was a very dishonorable move  that he pulled there. It was especially dishonorable when he used an innocent  in the process."</p><p>They  all looked out the hole in the dojo wall when they heard some moaning coming  from that direction. The four teenagers made their way over to the koi pond  looking down upon the recovering girl and panda.</p><p>With a  shake of her head Ranma looked up into the blurry faces of the Tendo sisters and the bastard that had knocked him into the  koi pond. With a growl she stood up on wobbly legs getting into a fighting  stance. "This battle isn't over yet asshole come on and fight!"</p><p>"I'm  afraid you're wrong Ranma-chan you were knocked  unconscious therefore you lost the fight and now have to give up your rights to  marry Akane and the dojo to Kenchi here."</p><p>Ranma  stared at the blurry form of Nabiki with hate in her  eyes then turned her glare to Kenchi and Akane. "This  isn't over. I will have her if it is the last thing I do, and neither you nor  anyone else is going to stop me." The girl then got out of the pond dragging  her father behind her as well as she could with her injuries.</p><p>"Oh wait Ranma  before you go." Nabiki spoke up. "This is for you."  She gave her a slip of paper then turned back to her family.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>"Why the bill for the doctors check  up of course. You didn't think that would be free did you?"</p><p>She smiled turning again to face the beaten martial artist.  "I'm sure you will be able to handle it and don't forget to stop by for  treatment for those injuries you have. I'm sure he will be more than happy to  help you out further." Ranma couldn't be sure but her  smile seemed to get darker as she said that.</p><p>With a "Humph" Ranma  tuned again to the gait to leave the Tendo compound. Not  paying the least amount of attention to the rocks that she was dragging the panda  over. She ignored the moans of pain coming from the panda while she was  dragging him along over sharp rocks and cement. She even ignored her own pain.  All she could think about as she left the Tendo compound was how she was going  to get her revenge on Kenchi Morisoto. Knowing once  he was defeated he could then take what was his. He would make all three Tendo  sisters suffer for this as well. Not only would he content himself with just  raping Akane and humiliating her in the most  provocative ways, he would also do the same to her sisters. While he was at it  he would make Kenchi watch as he took his precious fiancé's virginity, if she  even was a virgin that is. They would all pay for this humiliation, and pay for  it dearly.</p><p>Once  the Saotome men were gone Akane went back to hugging  her true fiancé a happy smile on her face. She looked up into his eyes seeing  him blush but looking back at her with love and caring. They were interrupted  from their thought as Nabiki spoke up.</p><p>"So  when's the wedding?"</p><p>Akane looked  over to see Nabiki smirking at the two of them while Kasumi looked a little  flush. Again she turned towards Kenchi seeing him blush deeper and smiled at  his shyness. He just looked so cute like that, she thought.</p><p>"Ahh,  well we thought that we should wait to get married until after high school at  least. I would at least like to wait till college, but Akane here won't hear of  it."</p><p>"You  bet I won't hear of it! You and I are getting married buster. I am willing to  wait three years but I won't wait any longer than that." She scrunched up her  nose at him frowning. In fact if she could, she would like to get him into a  tux this very second and to a church so they could be on their honeymoon by  tonight.</p><p>Clearing  his throat Soun made his presence known. Though it galled him to the core that  Ranma had lost the fight to this boy the fact remained that the boy had won.  True he was mad about what had happened to Kasumi yet she seemed fine and would  not suffer any ill affects. He would just have to lay into Ranma when he got  the chance once this current dilemma to his plans was taken care of. How to  take care of this problem was beyond him for the moment yet he would get this  problem taken care of. The house of Tendo and Saotome would be joined or he  would die trying to make it so. "I congratulate you on your victory young man.  As promised you will be Akane's fiancé.  However, I wish to meet your parents before  we make this official."</p><p>"You do  not have to worry about that Mr. Tendo. Although my father is dead and mother  missing, my aunt will be dropping by here to meet all of you. She is my current  guardian until such a time that my mother can be found."</p><p>"So you  are searching for your mother? What is her name?"</p><p>"I am  not sure of her name really. I have been going over records of women that my  father would have known before he died. I have looked at records of classmates  from school and other acquaintances that he could have loved. My aunt doesn't  know who she is either. I believe my grandmother knew who she was, yet my  grandmother has passed away." Kenchi looked down at the ground sadly earning a  supporting hug from Akane.</p><p>"Well  son I wish you luck on your search for your mother. Concerning this engagement  though you understand that it is a great responsibility, do you not? You must  understand that I cannot wait to long for an heir to take over the school. This  is the reason that I wished for Ranma as Akane's husband as they would then  take over the school and produce those heirs."</p><p>He was  about to say more when he noticed the glares he gained from his three  daughters. It was a surprise to him when it wasn't Akane or Nabiki that spoke  up, but Kasumi.</p><p>"Father! Akane is too young to be starting a family. How is  she even to get any students in the dojo if she does not have an education to  run the dojo properly? Were you just going to say here you go now start  teaching? We would be homeless within a month." Kasumi then turned to Akane  with a stern look. "Akane please say you will not quit school to start a family  too soon. You still have so much to learn about running the dojo properly…"</p><p>Soun looked at his daughter in shocked surprise as tears  came to his eyes. "B…b…but the dojo Kasumi. Think of  the dojo, a…a…and my d…d…dream. How could you yell at  your father like that? Whaaaaa!"</p><p>"Now  father stop your blubbering. Akane is just…"</p><p>Kenchi interrupted Kasumi by placing a hand on her  shoulder. "We are not going to quit school Ms. Kasumi. We both know we have  much to learn about running a dojo and life altogether. As I was saying, we  weren't planning on getting married until after our senior year of school so  you do not have to worry."</p><p>With a  sigh Kasumi conceded. Yet she still worried that her little sister would get  over her head. What if she started messing around and became pregnant. There  were just too many what ifs and that worried Kasumi most of all. Giving her  more doubts about leaving her family for collage. Could they really get along  without her there to help and be the mother they needed? Would her sisters really  be able to handle their father? The questions were just too numerous. Kasumi  sighed again looking at the two who had again started gazing into each other's  eyes. As the group started into the house, Kasumi looked over the koi pond  thinking of her mother and what she would have said in a situation like this.  With a final sigh, Kasumi followed everyone into the house and then went to  make some tea while the arguments about the engagement were settled. It was  turning out to be a very interesting day.</p><p>At the  edge of a city, a boy stood looking over the buildings from a cliff.  His hair was unruly and he wore a yellow  bandanna with black polka dots he wore a yellow shirt and black pants tied off  at the bottom. With his angry brown eyes he laughed. "Soon Ranma Saotome, I will have my revenge. You will not escape me now  that I have found Tokyo."</p><p>A  "Clang!" rang out as a mettle object met with his head. "This is Osaka  you Jackass. How you could get us lost when you were given that map by that old  man, I will never know.  That was a very  detailed map! You even said you knew the way there!"</p><p>"Gee  you don't have to be so uncute about it." He replied back. His companion  brandished the weapon that had so recently smashed him over the head. "Would  you care to repeat that?" With that he took off with his companion right on his  heels trying to brain him a second time. "Get back here Ryoga and take your  punishment like the pig you are."</p><p>"Ahh!  Come on, Ukyou.  I was just kidding." He replied trying to  escape from his crazy companion all the while blaming one Ranma Saotome for his  current situation. He shouted up to the sky as he ran "Ranma this is all your fault!"</p><p>Authors Notes:</p><p>So here  it is the end of chapter four. For next chapter if you couldn't tell by the  ending of this chapter will be dealing with Ryoga and Ukyou. How did they meet?  Why are they traveling together? Why is Ukyou letting Ryoga lead the way? Also  Kasumi has a talk with Dr. Tofu. All this and more on the next chapter of What's in a Name.</p><p>Sorry  to all of those who asked to be my prereaders yet  were unable to be. I am thankful for the support I have received on this story.  I would also like to thank my current prereaders for  the feedback you have given me. I don't know when I will have the next chapter  out as I am having problems with real life situations. I will get it out as  soon as I can though.</p><p>I have  been asked repeatedly on if or when Kenchi/Ranma will  get his memories back. The fact is that at this point he will get only sketches  of that life. He may find that he douse not wish to remember that time of his  life. Remember at that point he was only six years old. As far as what he will  remember and when just keep reading the story. All lot is going to happen in  the next couple of chapters.</p><p>On a note,  if anyone wishes to right a side story to the events that happen in this story  let me know. As long as it douse not interfere with the flow of this story I  probably won't mind.</p><p>Well  until next time thanks for reading.</p>
