</div>I do not nor have I ever owned any character relating to Ranma 1/2. Though I wish I did own them that way I would be living in the life of luxury at this moment I do not have that much talent or funds. So the point is I am writing this story for fun and will never get any payment from it. I will never be able to sell this story for any sort of profit. I will still suffer being next to penniless.<p>Chapter 5<p>A Time for Decisions<p>As she walked down the street looking over the consumable items she was out shopping for, Kasumi was deep in thought. Her thoughts kept returning to the discussions between her and her sisters. Her thoughts ranged around discussions ranging around her future in the operations of the family. It was frightening to think that her family did not need her in the house. After her mother had past away it was the only thing she had that made her feel close to her long dead mother. The home was the only way she thought that she could make her mother proud of her. It was her purpose to make her father and sisters live up to what her mother would have wanted them to become. Yet was it really what her mother wanted them to become or their father? Nabiki and Akane were right when they had said that their mother did not take any guff from their father when it came to their children. She could remember a time when her father had made the mistake of telling her mother that Akane would never amount to anything in martial arts because she was just a girl. After her mother had gotten through with him he had never said anything derogatory towards his daughters again. He had even stopped complaining that he had never had a son.<p>Kasumi smiled at a vendor as she inspected some fruit she was out to buy. During her inspection she noticed a young man walking down the street on the opposite side she was on. In fact it was a man she knew very well as she often took her little sister Akane to see him. She was startled as the man usually was in his clinic at this time of day. She smiled at the vendor again and selected the fruit she was out to by. After finishing up her purchase she made her way to follow the young doctor. She had always admired the young man. He was mature, successful, handsome, caring, and though a bit silly when she saw him he could always bring a smile to her face. In truth she enjoyed how he always seems to act silly around her. It was like he would always try to lighten her mood in any way. If she was feeling down at all she knew she could always go to see him and he would always make her feel better.<p>She saw him stop and rushed to catch up to him. All the while wondering about all the things she had to discuss with him. She knew that he would give her the answers she needed. He was wise and caring if a bit weird at times. She always enjoyed his company though and valued his friendship. It was her wish that one day they would become more than just friends and acquaintances. However she had made a vow to her mother to see her sisters happy and cared for before she left them. They needed a mother there to look after them. When she was close enough to hear what was being discussed she stopped in shock.<p>"Well there doctor do consider my offer you know how my daughter looks up to you."<p>"I know that Mr. Yama but I could not ask your daughter to take the job of being my assistant when her studies take priorities. I will consider it though I could use an assistant I just feel your daughter is a bit too overwhelmed at the moment."<p>"Oh you know that my Hikari won't be a going any further in her schooling Doctor. She be a good nurse though and she make a fine bride."<p>"I know that she can conduct herself Mr. Yama. You should have more faith in her."<p>"Oh come now Doctor you know that women don't amount to anything more than housewives an assistants to us men. They need us to give them direction and put them in the house were they belong."<p>"Do you believe that doctor?" Kasumi asked as she walked up to the talking men.<p>The good doctor froze at the voice. His glasses fogging up while his normally sharp mind turned to Swiss cheese. He turned to look at the beautiful girl behind him her beauty making his knees go week and heart to flutter.<p>"H...h...h...h...he...hell..hell...hello Kasumi, what a coincidence to see you here of all places?"<p>"It was a shock to see you here as well Doctor. I couldn't help but hear your conversation and was wandering if you agree with Mr. Yama's view."<p>"Oh come now little missy. You are the perfect example of what a woman should be. Everyone knows that your father has turned you into what it is to be a proper woman. Even more than your mother was."<p>"My mother was a very proper woman Mr. Yama."<p>"Oh I'm not saying she wasn't dear but she did have that temper of hers. Much like that younger sister of yer's. She was one of those tomboys like that." Mr. Yama smiled at Kasumi then closing his eyes he continued. "You however dear Kasumi have become every mans dream. The perfect girl who takes orders from men, as she should. You don't go around making with those silly idea's of running businesses and stuff like that. You have realized, as most women should, that her place is in the home taking care of the kids and husband. Yes you know your place and it is well you should. Isn't that right now good Doctor?"<p>Both Kasumi and Mr. Yama looked at Dr. Tofu who was at that moment in la la land and unable to really put together any coherent thoughts on the matter at hand anyway.<p>"Well Dr. Tofu do you believe what Mr. Yama said. Is my place just in the home like he said?" Kasumi looked at the young doctor who was opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water. "Well doctor do you believe what Mr. Yama is saying?" Kasumi again asked getting a tad impatient.<p>"Kassssssummmmi I...I...I...I don't know what to say? It is a lovely day out today isn't it? I must totally agree." He stopped yammering as Kasumi put a hand on his shoulder his back going completely rigid.<p>"Dr. Tofu I truly wish for an answer to this question. Do you believe that my place is only in the house? That I could not make something of myself on my own?"<p>"You needs to just get yourself a good young man there little lady." Mr. Yama spoke up for the doctor who was about to fall over in complete shock.<p>"Mr. Yama I do think that I could make something of myself outside of the home though. True I did stay home to look after my sisters and father, but that was my decision because they needed me there."<p>"Come now girl you know as well as I do that you wouldn't be able to last out here in the real world. Not a frail girl like you dear. You need a good man to be there to help you. You just need to stay home and look after them babies. Isn't that right Doctor Tofu?"<p>Due to his brain having the synapses response of a sloth the good doctor made the biggest blunder of his life. He nodded to Mr. Yama's question.<p>"I see."<p>Kasumi stepped back away from the two men and began to walk away. She didn't say anything more as she felt her insides turn.<p>How could he? She thought with a tear coming to her eye. How could he think that I am nothing more than a frail little girl that needs someone to take care of me? Is that what everyone thinks of me? Do they really think I can't do anything? Why didn't I see this before? Did I really not want to see what I was becoming? Am I truly just a little china doll in their eyes?<p>As a tier fell down Kasumi's cheek she made up her mind. She would no longer stand by and forgo her life. She would no longer be what everyone else thought she should be. For all her life all she ever wanted was to be like her mother. Yet as she went along she realized that her mother had been completely different from the woman that she was becoming. Yes, her mother was kind and sweet, but she also did things her own way. She never let anything stand in the way of her dreams. Her mother had helped her father make the dojo what it was. Her mother had been the one to get the students into the dojo. Not her father who thought that it was his doing. Her mother had fulfilled her dreams, now it was time for Kasumi to fulfill hers, and nothing was going to stand in the way of it.<p>Look out collage here comes Kasumi Tendo. You had better be ready Dr. Tofu because this little china doll housewife is going to be your competition.<p>With that thought Kasumi raised her head up high and made her way home to make a couple phone calls. Phone calls that would change her life drastically.<p>Meanwhile at Furincan High school a boy with black trousers tied at the ankles, a yellow shirt, and a yellow and black spotted bandana, along with his partner were coming up to the gates.<p>"Are you sure this is the right place?" The boy asked his companion.<p>"Yes you jackass! How many times do you have to ask that damn question? Look at the freaking sign on your left why don't you?" His companion responded.<p>The boy did just that and found himself looking at a road. "I don't see a sign." The next thing the boy knew his head was being turned violently towards the other direction he was looking. There in front of him on a brick wall was a sign saying Furinkan High School.<p>"Get a sense of direction jackass." His companion grumbled while walking towards the front gate of the school.<p>"Hey wait up!" He yelled following.<p>Akane was walking out into the school halls with Kenchi when Ranma approached them. He had a leer on his face and growled as he got closer to the two.<p>"What do you want?" Akane shot out as Ranma blocked their path.<p>"You, I want you, bitch that's what I want." He growled as he got into a stance. "I want to pay both of you back for the humiliation you have brought upon me and my family."<p>"You and your father brought on your own humiliation Ranma. Now I wish to walk with my fiancé home if you don't mind?"<p>"Yes I do mind you son of a bitch! Akane was supposed to be mine but you took her from me asshole!"<p>"Akane never belonged to anyone Ranma. She is my fiancée by her choice alone. Not because of a forced engagement or anything like. I asked her and she said yes."<p>"I will not accept this mockery!" Came a cry from down the hall. Soon the school idiot came charging down the hall with his sights set on Kenchi.<p>"Morisoto I will never accept your engagement to the fair Akane Tendo! Do you hear me?"<p>With what seemed like a quick kick to the face Kuno fell over with a thud. "I do not need your permission to marry Akane, Kuno. The only person I really need permission to marry her is herself. So shut up and let me finish my discussion with Ranma will you?"<p>He turned back to Ranma and saw that the other boy was on the floor as well. Smiling he looked to his red faced fiancé "Well I was going to try and settle this without him getting disgraced again Akane. I could have stopped him you know."<p>"I know, but he was really getting to me. He tried to grab me while you were distracted with Kuno."<p>"I know I could feel his movements. Just like I know that he is not unconscious right now are you Ranma."<p>With another growl Ranma got up from his position on the floor. "You will not get away from me Morisoto. I swear you will pay for what you have done."<p>"Ranma Saotome I have done nothing to you that you have not deserved."<p>Before Ranma could do anything more Kenchi took Akane into his arms and jumped out a nearby window. Angrily Ranma followed not caring to the shock of the other students that they were on the third floor of the building at the time. As he jumped out the window Ranma realized too late that Kenchi did not just jump out and drop down to the ground. He was balancing on a thin ledge just outside the window with Akane still in his arms. Ranma being too late to grab the ledge fell feet first into the schools swimming pool down below. The students who had gathered were shocked when it was not Ranma that came up from the pool but a blond haired girl in Ranma's clothing. Most of the student body already thought of Ranma as a creep and a pervert, now though they saw him as something else.<p>"What is going on?" One boy asked looking into the pool. "What happened to that new kid Ranma and where did you come from?"<p>"Did you see that? That boy just turned into a girl."<p>"Yeah it was that new pervert Ranma"<p>"What type of freak are you?"<p>"Gee I knew Akane had a reason for not wanting him but who could have imagined this?"<p>As the gossip started to spread Ranma became even more upset. Seething at the humiliation that Kenchi had again brought upon him, Ranma now a she looked over to see Kenchi land with Akane still in his arms. He saw him shaking his head as he let a smile come to his face which infuriated Ranma even more. He snarled at the pony tailed boy getting angrier by the minute. The next words out of Akane's mouth didn't help matters either.<p>"You know Ranma if you want to keep that curse of yours a secret you should be more careful. Why did you jump in to the pool anyway? I thought you were a great martial artist who wouldn't need a soft landing from falling a measly distance like say the third floor."<p>"Now Akane don't be rude. After all he didn't know that the pool was there. He may have just accidentally fallen in. However I must agree that you should be much more careful in the future Ranma. You could hurt yourself if you are not. However, as a good jester here is some hot water."<p>Ranma quickly snatched the hot water kettle Kenchi held up in his hands. Where he got the thing he didn't know and didn't care just that it was hot water to change back into a guy. That is he didn't care until the scalding hot water reached his hair and then his scalp seeming to burn him through. Even though Ranma was again a boy he was now very upset at the two other martial artists in the vicinity.<p>"You have humiliated me for the last time Morisoto."<p>"Die Saotome!"<p>As the shout came in the boy in question jumped back as another boy came from above angling an umbrella to strike where he had been only moments before. This was unfortunate for him as jumping back made him end up once again within the school pool. Turning him into a girl yet again.<p>"This just isn't your day is it Ranma?" He heard Akane say as he again stepped out of the pool. "So what did you do to piss this boy off? Try and get fresh with his..."<p>"Saotome Ranma for the humil..."<p>The boy was cut off from his tirade when a loud clag was heard and a large spat was seen smashing into the boys head.<p>"Ryoga you jackass what do you think you are doing?"<p>"Dam it Ukyou why did you do that? I was just making my entrance hear and about to smash Ranma Saotome to bits finally."<p>"Great you jackass just do that. Before you do though, I would suggest you look around you. You know, before you go and say, oh I don't know, attack some girl with blond hair."<p>"Huh?" Ryoga turned around and saw Ranma in his girl form staring at him as well as the other students of Furinkan High. "But he was here a moment ago Ukyou I swear. Dam you Ranma! Because of you I've seen hell!"<p>"Excuse me, I know that we all don't really like Ranma to much but would you mind telling us who you are." Akane asked confusion written on her face. The two newcomers turned to her the one named Ukyou was about to speak when the boy named Ryoga interrupted her.<p>"I'm Ryoga Hibiki and this is my tomboy of a fiancée Ukyou Kuonji." A loud clang was again heard as Ukyou's spat again found its way onto Ryoga's Head.<p>"Will you stop calling me that right off the bat jackass. Besides we won't have to get married in the first place if I can find Saotome in time. So shut up about that sugar."<p>"But your father said that we have to get married Ukyou, you know to hold up the honor of our families and everything. I mean when he found me in your room and everything."<p>"RYOGA YOU JACKASS" These words were followed by the bandanna wearing boy to be driven into the ground up to his knees. "How many times do I have to tell you that nothing happened, so we DO NOT HAVE TO GET MARRIED!"<p>"Don't you think you are being a little rough with him?"<p>Ukyou looked over to the boy who had spoken and glared. A glare that would usually send Ryoga into shivers each time it was sent his way. Kenchi however, took the glare in stride and walked over to the now half buried Ryoga. Pulling him out he proceeded to check over Ryoga's injuries. Finding everything ok he let the boy go.<p>As Ukyou watched the boy take out her fiancée she took in his features. She noticed the ponytail he wore and the way he seemed to glide as he walked. She noticed his blue eyes in fact they were the same eyes that she remembered looking at as she was playing with her old friend.<p>"Who are you, sugar?" Ukyou sweetened her voice as her grip on her favorite weapon tightened.<p>"He is my fiancé, Morisoto Kenchi." Akane spoke up as she did not like the way the professed girl was looking at her fiancé.<p>"Really, so you are to be married to him? So where is his father?"<p>"My father is dead. If you want to know you can ask me yourself. I would also stop thinking what you are thinking. I am not Ranma. He has green eyes not blue like mine. He is also a pervert and a creep."<p>"Just because you are not as manly as me Morisoto you don't have to wine about it." Ranma said having turned back into his male form again.<p>"You are a pervert Ranma not a man." Came the response.<p>Upon seeing Ranma Ryoga began to move to attack the green eyed boy. He was stopped however by a hand on his shoulder. It surprised him. He could usually muscle through anything with his strength. "I would not do that as we have not ascertained the reason you both wish to attack Ranma. I said it before we may not like Ranma but I will not let you attack him in my school without knowing the reason."<p>"He made me see hell!" Ryoga yelled in his face.<p>"How did he make you see hell is what I want to know?"<p>"It is because of him that I have that tomboy as a fiancé, when he never showed for our man to man challenge."<p>"What was the use of showing up lost boy? You would never have made it anyway. You probably never even made it home that day did you idiot?"<p>"RANMA!"<p>"I would stop, anger will not get you anywhere. I would also stop insulting him Ranma."<p>"You should butt out Morisoto. We don't need your holier than thow attitude."<p>"Never the less you will need to listen to it Ranma. Now Ryoga, would you please continue?"<p>"You don't know the tortures I went through."<p>"Then why don't you enlighten us?"<p>Ryoga scowled at the girl standing next to Kenchi. How could he tell them of his plight, his embarrassment? It was all Ranma's fault didn't they understand that? Didn't they know how evil he is? Couldn't they tell? Why were they questioning him on such matters as why he needed to justify his plight to get revenge on Ranma Saotome? There should be no question on his right to beat the living daylights out of his arch nemesis. Why were they making things so rough for him?<p>Ryoga was about to come out with another scathing remark when Ukyou interrupted him. "First of all this jackass was late to a duel that was supposed to happen between the two. Then he went and followed the Saotome's to China where he picked up some kind of curse that he wont tell me about for some reason. Then he goes and gets lost in my bedroom at home and falls asleep in my bed while I am sleeping there which ends up with my father catching us in the morning in the same bed and getting engaged. In order to get out of that though all I have to do is find Ranma and make him honor his engagement to me or die for the honor of the Kounji family for what he and his father have done to us. Dose that answer some of your questions?"<p>"Well sort of I guess. How about you Akane, did you follow all of that?"<p>"Yeah I guess I did but what I want to know now is what Ranma did to Warrant someone hunting him down like this? Did he make some perverted moves on you Kounji-san?" Akane asked the girl.<p>"No my Ranchan wouldn't do something like that. We were kids together. One day my father asked his father if we could be engaged. In offering of the engagement my father offered our okonomiyaki stand as a dowry. However, the jackasses took off and left me behind. I was so humiliated by that. It got so bad I had to forsake my womanhood just to get by. I spent my time constantly perfecting my skills in the family arts. Each day against the crashing waves I would practice and prepare...<p>It was at this time that Ukyou noticed that everyone else had broken into their own little conversation. Some were even eating an afternoon snack.<p>HEY I'M TALKING HERE!<p>"We are listening as well as we can." Kenchi replied as the ringing in his ears subsided. "Perhaps we can do this another time though as Akane and I need to get back to her place. We have some important business to take care of there. I know your story sounds interesting, but with the object of your story already gone there is no longer any point to this conflict here I think. What do you think Akane?"<p>It was at this time that the others noticed that Ranma had made a quick disappearance. What they did not know was that during Ukyou's monolog he had again tried to kidnap Akane and she had punted him into what is commonly referred as Low Earth Orbit or (LEO).<p>"Perfectly fine with me dear. Let's get home before anything else happens. I sure don't want to find out that you have a fiancé that I don't know about. That would really make my day."<p>"What would you do if one did come after me Akane?"<p>"Why pound you into mush my dear. Then show the hussy why I am the only one that you will be marrying."<p>Looking into her fierce expression Kenchi smiled and kissed her in front of everyone there. It was only a light peck but it did turn a few heads.<p>"Kenchi! We are in public you should wait for stuff like that."<p>Noticing what she said Akane quickly looked around and noticed all the shocked faces looking at her. Blushing to her core she pulled a smirking Kenchi along with her out of the school yard while saying "jerk" under her breath.<p>Nabiki followed the couple out of the school yard toward home. She was shaking her head at the antics of the couple. Dam it Kenchi should be hers. She couldn't even get him to look her way much less get him to drop her sister. She had been trying for a few weeks now to get the boys' attention but he only had eyes for her sister. How did the girl get so lucky? True she did not go out of her way to break them up. She only did little things that would break most teenaged romance up yet the two saw through most of those. Well Kenchi did at any rate. He seemed to smell out any rumor or lie and shelve it post haste. It was with these thoughts that she noticed the two newcomers following the couple as well.<p>At the Tendo dojo Soun Tendo was in a quandary. How was he going to get his daughter to marry Ranma? His little girl was getting too many ideas in her head by being with that other boy. How dare he turn her against her father like that? She should be obedient to him like Kasumi was. He needed to cull this independent streak of hers. He needed to get her married to Ranma so the two Anything Goes Martial Arts schools would be joined. As Nabiki would not take over the school he would have to deal with her later as soon as he took care of Akane. Both of his little girls needed to be protected like any other little girl.<p>Soun was distracted by a knock at the door. He waited for Kasumi to come and open the door to lead the visitor in. As the knocking continued he grew curios as to why Kasumi had not answered the door yet. He got up and proceeded to the door wondering where Kasumi was.<p>Souns thoughts of Kasumi's whereabouts were cut off however when he opened the door and soon had himself glomped.<p>"OHHHHH KENCHI HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME? HAVE YOU CHANGED THAT MUCH IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR? WAHHHHH HOW COULD YOU? JUST LOOK AT YOU! YOU HAVE LET YOUR HAIR GET SO LONG AND YOU TOOK IT OUT OF THAT CUTE PONYTAIL! YOUR EYES ARE SO MEAN AND SHIFTY! OHH MY POOR KENCHI!"<p>"Um excuse me madam? Um I think you might have made some sort of mistake? You see I am not this Ken..."<p>"DON'T YOU WORRY KENCHI AUTY IS HERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW!"<p>"Umm madam I am not Kenchi." Soun got out releasing himself from the glomp. "Do you understand that? Now what I would like to kno..."<p>"Oh Kenchi you don't have to worry I will not let anything happen to you now." The woman cut him off glomping onto him again.<p>"B...b...b...b...but lady I am not..."<p>"Daddy what are you doing?" Came a voice from the gate.<p>"Uhhh aunty why are you glomping my future father in law like that?"<p>It is safe to assume that Soun in his own right is a martial arts master. After all he does own his own dojo. He did survive his training with his perverted master. He does even from time to time teach. So it was to his surprise that he found himself through the wall of the house and indented into the outer wall of the yard. How such a small seeming woman could do that to him is a mystery in itself. However with a wimpering "Ouch" Soun fell from the wall onto his back in a daze.<p>The woman, after throwing Soun through the house wall and into the outer wall turned her sights on Kenchi and his fiancé. Her eyes became glassy and, holding her arms out proceeded to glomp onto Kenchi. Driving the air from his lungs as Akane looked on.<p>"Um Kenchi? You know this woman?" She asked a frown appearing on her face. This of coarse was a mistake speaking as it turned the woman's attention onto her.<p>"Oh you must be the girl Kenchi has written to me about. Oh how adorable." This being said while pulling Akane into the glomp along with Kenchi.<p>"Aunty what are you doing here so early? I wasn't expecting you for another hour or so." Kenchi gasped out while trying to breath in the woman's python like grip.<p>"Oh you know nothing could keep me away from you my little Kenchi! I Just had to get here as soon as I could!"<p>In the background a recovered Soun started to giggle when she called Kenchi her little Kenchi saying "I can't believe it Little Kenchi, what a joke."He soon found himself with a face full of pissed off aunty though giving him the meanest stare he had seen since the last time his wife had given him such a stare before her passing.<p>"No one mocks my little Kenchi do you hear me, do you?" She growled through her sneer also grabbing his cheeks pinching and stretching them.<p>"Owww, ok lady, I understand, owe hey that hurts!" Soun cried out trying to free his cheeks from the crazy woman's pinching fingers.<p>With his face in his left hand Kenchi held up a sign that his aunt couldn't see but Soun could. Spotting the sign Soun read aloud. "I am sorry o beautiful and youthful woman. I made a mistake for patronizing your dear little Kenchi and I should have known better. Please forgive me oh shining star of the heavens."<p>As he finished reading the sign the woman let go of his cheeks smiling at him. "Oh ok now give me a hug to signify the union of our two families." She then proceeded to squeeze the life out of the Tendo patriarch.<p>Now a little ways up the road from the Tendo place of residence stood to young women looking for their lost companion. Nabiki being one of those women was a bit shocked at the profanity that was coming from her current companion at the moment. That and the threats of bodily harm she was shouting out to their currently missing companion.<p>"Ryoga you jackass where the hell are you now? How could you get your ass lost when I just turn my head for a second you retarded jerk!"<p>"You have issues don't you?"<p>The glare Ukyou gave Nabiki was not pretty.<p>"You try to be engaged to a wandering buffoon and see how you like it!"<p>"Hmmm, I don't know, his looks don't seem too bad to me. If he was wealthy I think I could see myself going for him."<p>"You will keep your hands off of him if you know what's good for you!"<p>"I thought you don't want him though?"<p>Ukyou blinked at that realizing what she had said, but recovered quickly. Of coarse not quickly enough to escape Nabiki's notice of her protectiveness of the boy.<p>"I mean if you don't want to get hurt by his incompetence then you will stay away from him since he is a trouble magnet and tends to be over zealous at times."<p>"I'm sure." Nabiki answered as she walked through the gate of her home to see her father being glomped by an attractive older woman.<p>"Daddy?"<p>The woman looked her way and the next moment Nabiki was confronted by 120 lbs of motherly love. She would have been concerned for her father as he again flew through the house wall and into the outer wall if she was not being glomped herself at the moment.<p>"Oh how cute another suitor for my little Kenchi. How handsome a man he is!"<p>"Auntie she is Akane's sister not another suitor. The only suitor I have is Akane."<p>"Oh what about that little Amazon girl then, hmmm?"<p>"Auntie you know as well as I do that I will never marry a cousin of mine. Even if she is not really related to me by blood she is still too much like a sister to me to marry. That is all I think of with Shampoo. She is my sister and that is all. I will not marry her. I am marrying Akane."<p>At the angry proclamation the woman finally released Nabiki, who fell to the ground with a thud gasping for breath, starting to get tiers in her eyes.<p>"Y...y...you yelled at me! Whaaaaaa"<p>"Auntie I am truly sorry but you must understand that I am marrying this woman that I love."<p>Akane then walked up to the sobbing woman putting a hand on her shoulder. "There now I know that Kenchi didn't mean to hurt your feelings he just wants you to understand that we love each other and plan to get married when we finish with school. He just doesn't want you to be confused is all."<p>The woman looked up at Akane, and a smile came to her face she then proceeded to glomp onto the poor girl as if she was a teddy bear. This of coarse gave Akane the experience of what her father and sister had just gone through.<p>Having recovered again from being faceplanted into the outer wall, Soun spoke up. "Well now how about we go into the house and we can get Kasumi to make us some tea. Then we can talk about this foolishness inside where I think we can come to the right understanding."<p>"I am afraid I can't make tea at the moment father."<p>Everyone looked up to see Kasumi walk into the front gate. Now it wouldn't be shocking that Kasumi would be walking into the front gate. Soun might have just asked where she had been and expected her to answer that she was shopping as such a good little girl was supposed to. Yet what had everyone of the Tendo's in aw was the fact of what Kasumi was wearing.<p>She was dressed as Nabiki would normally dress in fact. Tan pants with white blouse. Pants belted at the waist. Moderately high heeled shoes on her feet. She had Makeup on her face which she hardly ever really wear. Her hair was up in a bun, and she had a white purse on her shoulder.<p>"I am sorry I can't cook for all of you tonight but I have many things to take care of if I am going to be ready to begin my classes at University in two days." She said passing her shocked father and entering the house. "Please everyone come in I am sure you don't want to stay out on the front lawn all day do you?"<p>With those words she proceeded inside the door and into the house. Kenchi pulled his Aunt and Akane along after her shortly followed by Nabiki and Ukyou. None of them bothered to move the statue that was the girls' father. He stayed on the front lawn for quite some time before walking mechanically into the house himself.<p>AN:<p>And with that I have finally ended chapter five of my story. I know it has taken over a year to post this story and as of right now this is a draft copy of this chapter. As soon as I can find the list again I will be sending this out to pre-readers.<p>Ok just to head off any questions before they start because I may not be able to answer them anytime soon anyway. In this chapter Tofu acts idiotic. I know I did this for a purpose. The man needs to grow up. He needs to see that not paying attention can get him in trouble. Well I am giving him one hell of a wake up call. I have not decided yet if I will get Kasumi and Tofu together. If it does happen then I feel I will be taking something away from what I need in the story to happen with another character.<p>As you can tell from this chapter Kasumi will be shortly leaving and this will affect the Tendo's. I want this to happen as they also need to know what it feels like to be on their own. In fact if anyone wants to write a side story on Kasumi's collage adventures just ask me first.<p>I have been wondering about what some have been saying about me making Akane out to be OOC. I feel she is not OOC at all. If she gets mad she will still pound the living daylights out of the one who got her mad if she is able to. As far as acting nice she does that all the time in the Anime and magna so what may I ask is OOC about it? The only time she really gets violent is when Ranma would really call her names, when her father would shove the engagement down her throat, or when she was challenged.<p>I have more planned that is coming for the other characters. One question that has been asked is when Kenchi will be found out as the real Ranma. First of all that will not happen right away. I still need to get Ranma's mother involved first. You will see in the next chapter that Auntie and her do not get along.<p>Well as for next time we get to see Soun go into a fit. We get to see Soun, Genma, and Ranma beaten up by girls, and we get to see a little of the mistery of who the fake Ranma really is. Also someone from Kenchi's past pays a visit. Well Until next time I can get online with a chapter.<p>Take care.
