</div><p><b>What's In A Name</b><p><b>Chapter 7</b><p><b>Challenges</b><p>DISCLAIMER: I do not own these characters. They are owned by the geniuses that created them not me. If I had half the talent that put the Ranma characters out I wouldn't be writing on . I would be a whole lot better off as well. Not a poor slob.<p>Sometimes life can take a turn that can make the most jaded person break out crying like a baby. There have been times that life has thrown such curve balls that the people involved have shut themselves away for years at a time. There are a lot of people that have made attempts to correct the lifestyle they were living at the time to correct the tragedy that they have inflicted to receive such harsh treatment in there life.<p>Others when they look at people like this have said it has been karma that has given these people the harshness that has ruled their lives. Karma can be a tricky thing though. It would seem that there are enough good people that get bit in the butt by karma enough times. There are people that try to live their lives as best they can, but then have something happen that will ruin dreams with just a word.<p>Let's take in the life of one Dr. Ono Tofu. He is a man that has lived most of his life in the pursuit of helping others. He is a gentile man who generally cares for the people he treats. He has treated many a man or woman from older to younger. He did not discriminate towards the people he helped. Weather it was simple back pain to a broken arm he was always there to help.<p>When Tofu started his practice he got all sorts of recognition with in the prefecture of Nerima. He was wise beyond his years. So people would always come to him. Mothers would constantly try to set up their young daughters with him. To everyone he was the perfect man. There was just nothing wrong with him that anyone could see.<p>Then it happened, he met a young woman who was just beginning her first year of high school. The young woman of about 15 was leading her younger sister into the clinic in which he worked. Upon seeing the young women the doctor had instantly fallen in love. The only problem with this is that for the men in his family, at least from his fathers line, were somewhat cursed. When faced with love they tend to go somewhat nuts. It is not the kind of love that people tend to grow into and mature with that can cause this reaction, but the kind of love at first sight. The instant attraction that is felt from the first meeting with a woman whom he would like to be with will make a man of his stature into a jabbering idiot.<p>The reason for this curse has been long debated by the women who have married these fools of love. Some have said it is just that they suffer from a acute form of shyness. This is accompanied by a physiological need to not be hurt by the woman they are attracted to causes the male to act erratic. All the others just think that the men are just idiots, but they love them anyway.<p>Dr. Tofu being like the other men in his line acted just as his father before him. Whenever the young woman came around he would act like a clown and unknown to him would lose himself to the love of his life.<p>Dr. Tofu being the kind man he was also should not have let two enemies within two feet of his clinic. In fact he was berating himself for not being so cautious to begin with when he invited the lovely young blind girl into the clinic. It was sad in a way that in his cause to help the young girl his whole clinic was now being torn apart.<p>It of coarse had started when the young girl stepped through the door and then heard the other two patients he was treating. The two had staggered in after being beaten within an inch of their life. They had stated that they had been roughed up by a gang of 40 burly guys. By the look of the two the Doctor believed the story. The older of the two had broken ribs, broken arm, broken leg, and a concussion. The young man also suffered from a concussion as well as broken bones. The both of them had bruises and cuts over the majority of their bodies. The doctor quickly treated the both of them then let them rest in one of his recovery rooms. He did not have much space so he had brought in a cot so the both of them could share a room. The complaining of the older man had gotten on his nerves quickly and he had quickly left and stepped outside to relieve the headache he was getting.<p>Then seeing the purple headed blind girl navigating her way down the street had touched something within him. She looked so helpless that his heart had gone out to her. How was he to know that the girl of no more than 16 years would wreak so much havoc on his poor little clinic?<p>It had started out fine until the girl had heard the older man in the next room start to wine again to his son. The girl had then asked the doctor if she could be lead to the man as he was someone she knew. He had gladly led her to the room the two patients were recovering in. He opened the door to the room just as the older man had let out another piteous moan.<p>The girl had then jumped past him Saying, "Aiya, Shampoo finally catch panda man and stupid girl boy. Shampoo Kill!" The girl had then pulled a sword from somewhere, (the doctor couldn't even tell how she had hidden the thing,) and proceeded to swing wildly at the two injured men. It was lucky for the two men that the girl was blind, as they were able to dodge even in their sorry states.<p>"Please, calm down!" The doctor called out trying to catch the girl as she leapt around the room her swings destroying furniture and tearing deep holes in the walls. It was to the doctors great regret that the skirmish left the room and ran all through his quant little clinic.<p>"Ahhhhh, get this crazy chick away from me!" The young man yelled out drawing the attention of the purple haired girl to him.<p>"Ranma no escape Shampoo now! Ranma die for what he do to Shampoo!" The girl lunged while in mid speech barely missing the young man.<p>"Leave me alone slut, you deserved what you got. A warrior is prepared for the paroles of battle." The girl growled at him attacking more fiercely at the sound of his voice.<p>"Ranma is cheat, and raper. Shampoo end enemy of women's life so all women's live in piece."<p>The doctor knew he needed to stop this as quickly as he could. By the sound of it this Ranma was a vile boy yet the doctor had taken an oath. He could not let the girl kill the boy in his presence. Let alone let her continue to tear up his clinic.<p>"All of you need to settle down. You are tearing up my clinic." Dr. Tofu made a lunge towards the purple haired girl trying to hit her sleep spot.<p>At that moment a few things happened. Drawn by the ruckus coming from the clinic Kenchi and Akane both entered to see what was going on. The both of them upon recognizing Genma and Ranma leaped into action. Kenchi took on Genma quickly rendering him unconscious. Akane, while not as quick as Kenchi still got the drop on Ranma and sent him into dreamland via one of her pile drivers of a punch. Tofu having reached the purple haired girl managed to hit her sleep spot yet he over balanced and wound up falling upon the now unconscious girl.<p>"Dr. Tofu how could you! What do you think you are doing to that poor girl?" Akane was so shocked she could not decide if she should run out of the clinic and forget the whole scene, or pound the doctor who she had had a secret crush on. It was true that she had gotten over the good doctor yet she also knew that her older sister also sported feelings for the man. Now that her sister was gone she had wondered if the two would still have a chance to get together. It seemed that Kasumi had left at just the right time. It would have broken her heart to see the doctor acting like a pervert.<p>Tofu recovered himself and looked around at the shocked faces of both Akane and her boyfriend Kenchi if he remembered right. The two were looking at him as if he had done something wrong. He looked down and saw that when he had fallen, one of his hands had fallen upon the young girls' chest. He squeezed the breasts just to make sure that is what he was feeling earning a shriek from Akane and a mallet over his head. It was by shear will that he did not end up unconscious by the hit. Someone would have to teach that girl that hitting people with that mallet could be quite dangerous. Not only for him but the others around him as well could be hurt. It was bad enough that his face was planted within the young purple haired girls' chest now.<p>Tofu could also sense that the young woman was waking up as well. He heard someone being dragged back and the grunt of flesh hitting flesh. With blurry eyes he looked up to see the outline of what he assumed was Akane being held by her boyfriend. She was very upset it seemed. He looked down at the young woman under him again and saw that she was reaching up to him. She touched his face feeling with her fingers the outline of who was over her.<p>In a weak unsure voice the girl asked. "Is man?"<p>Tofu answered the young girl as well as helping her to her feet. "I am sorry about knocking you unconscious like that, but you were getting a bit hysterical there. I realize that you have strong feelings towards my patients, however that does not mean you can go around tearing apart my clinic."<p>What happened next could have been one of the most shocking ordeals of the young doctor's life. The girl suddenly through her arms around his neck and kissed him full on the lips. There was a shocked gasp from behind him as well as a flare up of extreme heat. When the girl finally broke the lip lock she looked sweetly within his direction saying.<p>"Wo Ai Ne Arien!"<p>"What?" The doctor asked turning to the other two conscious people within the room.<p>Kenchi sighed while holding Akane back from tearing into the young doctor. He could understand her anger in a way. She had been hounded by the biggest pervert at school for months now. Add to that the trouble with the Saotomes, and you have the recipe for a disaster waiting to happen. Akane had adapted a zero tolerance policy for all things she labeled perverted. No matter how circumstantial the situation may be. Despite the fact that he had told her about the policies of the tribe of Chinese Amazons she still saw the doctor as being perverted to the young girl under him. Though it was true the doctor was taking his time removing himself from the young woman.<p>"Doctor I do not wish to presume anything but would you mind removing yourself from your new wife long enough so we can get this all sorted out?" Kenchi sighed when he saw that the doctor was still looking at him blankly.<p>"Doctor Tofu! GET OFF OF HER!" Akane shouted still trying to get out of her fiancés grip to forcibly remove the young doctor from the young girl.<p>The Doctor's mental faculties finally kicked in, and realizing what he was doing he leapt from the girl backing against the far wall of the examination room. He looked around and saw the prone bodies of the two Saotome men lying in heaps on the floor. He also saw the fierce look within Akane's eyes, and the slightly amused eyes of her boyfriend. He then looked back over to the girl whom was getting up from her prone position on the floor.<p>"W…wh…wh…what is going on here."<p>"You were being a pervert doctor. I can't believe this. What would Kasume say if she saw you like this? I am so glad she left for collage to get away from everything. If she saw this it would have broken her heart."<p>The Doctor face suddenly shot to Akane at her words. Did he just hear what he thought he heard? Did she really just say that Kasumi was gone?<p>"What do you mean Kasumi left?" Tofu asked not believing her words. It was impossible for something like that to happen. He had not even had the chance to ask the young woman out.<p>"She left for school thank goodness. It would be disgusting for her to see you like this. Flaunting around with young girls and taking advantage of them. Just look at you letting her hang off of you like that."<p>It was true, while the young doctor had been in shock at the news that the love of his life had left without him the young Amazon had made her way to him and latched on to him with all her might. The Amazonian girl latched on to him had a big smile on her face happy at the thought that she would be able to get a doctor as a husband.<p>"Arien no worry bought other womans. Come and Shampoo make Arien to to happy."<p>"Shampoo I think this is not a good time for this. We have a bit to discuss with the doctor before you try to cart him off to China." Kenchi smirked as he saw that his friend, whom he was very glad to see, was alright seemed to realize that he was in the room. He frowned at the look of her eyes seeing the damage that Cologne had warned him about. His gaze turned to where Ranma was laying on the floor a fierce look appearing on his face as he thought of the things he wanted to do to the bastard for what he had done to his friend.<p>The low growl from his throat finally got through Akane's anger. She looked back at her fiancé noticing him looking at the boy on the floor. She had never really seen him look at someone with such anger before. It was somewhat frightening. She reached around enveloping him in her arms and spoke in a whisper.<p>"Calm down Kenchi, I'm the one that is supposed to have a problem with my anger not you."<p>Kenchi looked down at his fiancée and seeing the cute smile on her face that always seemed to make his heart flutter with excitement, that smile made him forget the bastard on the floor for the moment. After all there was a much more satisfying figure to look at in his arms as it was.<p>"What is going on here?"<p>The question brought the attention of the young couple back to the confused doctor.<p>"Well it looks to me that you are enjoying the pleasure of your new wife to me doctor."<p>"What do you mean new wife! I have never been married."<p>With a sigh Kenchi started to explain, also noticing the smile appearing on Shampoo's face as she realized who was speaking.<p>"Doctor Tofu, and Akane I would like you to meet Shampoo. She is from a small village in China full of Amazons. They have certain laws that pertain to outsiders. One such law pertaining to outsider women states, that if an Amazon is defeated by an outsider woman she must give that woman the kiss of death. The Amazon must then hunt that woman to the ends of the earth to kill her to regain her honor. The other law pertaining to outsider men states, that if an Amazon is defeated by an outsider man she must give him the kiss of marriage. The Amazon will then be required to live as man and wife with the man that defeated her. You my good doctor in knocking out Shampoo defeated her, so she has given you the kiss of marriage. You are now considered husband and wife according to Amazonian law."<p>"Well that is all fine and good except we are in Japan and not in her village much less in China so there is no way I will be marring a young girl I do not even know much less is only about sixteen to seventeen years of age."<p>"Sorry to say this doctor, but to her it doesn't make a difference. As stated in Amazon law you are to marry her, and where ever an Amazon goes she takes her laws with her."<p>"It doesn't matter that she takes her laws with her. I am protected by Japanese law, so that means I do not have to marry her. Besides there is someone else that I am interested in so I have no time for an Amazon bride."<p>"You really should not have said that doctor."<p>The young doctor gave the young man confused look, then looked down to the young woman holding on to him and was startled to see the fierce scowl there.<p>"Who is womans that arien is wanting over Shampoo. Shampoo take care of all womans who want husband. Other womans is obsticals. Obsticals are for killing."<p>"You will not lay a hand on Kasumi! Do you understand that girl? I will not have anyone lay a hand on her."<p>"Too bad for you doctor Tofu, after all since Kasumi is gone there is no real obstacle for you to marry this girl. After all it seems that you were being very affectionate to her earlier. Hmph, I don't see the problem as it seems you are more than affectionate right now."<p>"Akane, she is hugging me, I am not hugging her. So please stop with the accusations. I am not marrying this girl, nor am I married to her. Now, I must be off to stop this travesty of Kasumi leaving. I will go and ask her to stay. She can still borrow my books as I have a lot of books that she likes to borrow. Then I will ask her out, and everything will be perfect again."<p>"Well, that will be kind of hard since she already left doctor. Besides you seem to be doing just fine with this new girl right here. I will not have you two timing my sister."<p>"Calm down Akane, I am sure that the doctor was not really planning on two timing Kasumi. I also know that Kasumi will not be coming back at least until break. She was set on getting a degree and furthering her education. I am sorry doctor, but I think that if you had wanted to ask Kasumi out you should have done it a long time ago."<p>"Hmph, like the letch could even get the gumption to even ask my sister out to begin with. It was your loss Doctor Tofu. You are the one that messed up. My sister waited forever for you to ask her out as you say. However, you were the one that always acted so goofy around her. If you would have just grown a pair you would have had an opportunity to be with her."<p>He could not believe it. He could not believe her words that his precious Kasumi had left him. There was no way that she could have left the Tendo household to go to some collage. What did she know about being out in the world? His Kasumi was to sweet and kind to handle the riggers of collage life. The people there could be quit cruel to someone like her. There were men there that would take advantage of her in a heartbeat. He had heard of many sweet girls going to collage then coming back dishonored and pregnant. He would not be there to protect her from the wolves that would descend upon her. That must not be. He would have to go to her. He would have to be there for her.<p>"I must ask for all of you to leave now. I have things I must prepare for."<p>"Like what doctor? You aren't thinking of following Kasumi are you? That would be a big mistake."<p>"What would you know boy? Do you know how dangerous it is for a young woman out there? She could be in serious danger from the perverse men that will try to harm her. She is just to delicate to be on her own."<p>Akane got even angrier just listening to the doctor's tirade.<p>"How could you? Kasumi thought that you were a true man. We both thought that you were a man to be admitted. How could you say that about her? Kasumi needed this more than anything. She needed to get away from the pigs like you that were holding her back! You don't deserve her! I hope she goes to collage and finds a true man to be with. One that will not only take care of her but also let her fly like she deserves. A man that will let her pursue her dream of become a doctor. I see you would just have kept her in a gilded cage just like our father. You…"<p>"SHUT UP! Do you know what I go through every time I see your sister Akane? DO YOU? How I go insane because I know she could do better than me? I know I could be a better man to her! Do you know how much I wanted to ask her out? I have always loved Kasumi."<p>"Then why did you never say anything to her?"<p>Kenchi stared straight into the doctor's eyes not backing down from the young doctor's stare. Stare the young doctor did. His expression turned to shock as he realized that the young man in front of him was rite. Why hadn't he told Kasumi that he had loved her? Was it truly something he could not do? Could he really not be able to tell her?<p>"I'm scared! OK, I admit it! I'm scared that Kasumi will tell me that she does not love me. I'm scared that she will reject me and tell me that she is in love with someone else! Is that what you want to hear? IS IT?"<p>"That is not something I needed to hear. It is something that Kasumi had needed to hear. You however have lost your chance for that doctor. She is gone to live her life now. Since you were to afraid to tell Kasumi your true feelings you ended up waiting to long. Kasumi is off to live her own life now. For good or ill she has a chance to make her own decisions. She has the chance to make her own mistakes and learn from them. She does not need to be coddled and treated as a put in your view of a woman that will just stay at home at be your perfect little housewife. She was never perfect you know. I could see that with her acting she may have seemed to be the perfect woman to any Japanese man. However, she was very unhappy on the inside. It was just a matter of time before she would have lost herself completely. She would have resented any marriage she would have been in even if the person she had married had been the love of her life. She would have become bitter because she would have never been able to live the dreams she has always wanted. She would have always wondered if there was anything more to the life she had lived. Doctor I suggest you take your new fiancé and learn to enjoy your new life as well."<p>"I can't give up on Kasume!"<p>"Shampoo think new arien need to learn that Shampoo is only for him, yes?"<p>"Listen girl, I told you I am not going to marry you."<p>"I would think you do not have a choice son in law."<p>Every one turned to see a wrinkled old woman standing on her staff in the doorway. Her face was set in a frown as her bulbous eyes rested upon the young doctor. She turned her gaze to Shampoo her frown turning into a scowl.<p>"I see you have been out making trouble great granddaughter. I would have hoped that you would have stayed where you belonged and not gone and done something foolish as try a hunt by yourself in your condition. I am sorry for the inconvenience son in law, but my great granddaughter can be quite impulsive."<p>"Why are you calling me your son in law? I told you I am not marrying this girl." Tofu said his face set in a fierce scowl.<p>"We shall see about that son in law. We shall see. I believe my great nephew has already explained our laws to you?"<p>"He did, and as I have stated to him I am Japanese, not Chinese, so your laws have no bearing on me."<p>"Oh but they do son in law. You have defeated an Amazon and will now pay the price for that defeat."<p>"I would listen to the old ghoul she can be quite persuasive. Ouch!"<p>The old woman smirked as she took her staff from Kenchi's head. "As usual Kenchi you use 10 percent of your brain and 90 percent of your mouth. How do you deal with him my dear Akane?"<p>"Love and patients honored elder. As well as a good right hook." She replied with a smirk.<p>"Aiya, Kenchi has girlfriend?"<p>"She is a fiancée actually, one that I love with all my heart."<p>"How you defeat Kenchi? No one back in village ever defeat great Kenchi for marriage before."<p>"I hit him from behind while he was distracted of course."<p>"Aiya, why shampoo never think of that?'<p>"Sigh, can we drop this and get back to more important matters? First of all there is no way you can force me to marry this young girl elder. I have practice here that I enjoy and will not leave for China abandoning my home. As I already stated there is already someone I care for, and I intend to go after her."<p>"Ah, but son in law you have already stated that you would not be able to court this other woman. It was also stated that she is no longer in the running for you to court. I then believe that my Shampoo has the most valid claim here. However I will give you a bit of time to come to your senses. Come Shampoo let us leave from this place and let the young doctor clean." She said bouncing over and grabbing Shampoo's arm.<p>"But great grandmother? What about shampoo revenge on cheating pervert boy?"<p>"You can have your revenge later"<p>"But great grandmother!"<p>"I said…"<p>"What is going on here?"<p>At the interruption everyone turned to see a young woman with long hair and a baker's peal on her back standing in the doorway with a young man in a yellow shirt and leopard print bandana. The young man seemed to have a nasty bump on his head.<p>"We came over to this clinic to have this dufuses booboo looked at. Is this a private party or can anyone join in?"<p>"This is a private matter young one. There is no need for you to step in to this."<p>"That's fine, but will someone look at this jerk's little bump so he will quit bellyaching to me?"<p>"Sigh, let me just put the Saotomes back into bed, then I will be with you."<p>"Did you say Saotomes?" The girl said, her expression souring instantly.<p>"Uh, doc I really think you should have not said that?" The boy in the yellow shirt said instantly noticing the tightening of the young woman's muscles.<p>The young doctor turned to see the situation and reacted quickly. "NO FIGHTING IN THE CLINIC! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS! EVERYONE OUT! AS SOON AS I GET THESE TWO IDIOTS UP THEY ARE OUT OF HERE TOO! NO MORE I AM TIRED OF IT!" With that the young doctor shoved everyone out the door then proceeded to forcibly wake his two unconscious guests. The doctor then threw the two out on their keasters. "And stay OUT!" He said slamming the door turning the open sign to close.<p>"My, the son in law is excitable isn't he?"<p>"You sure can say that again. He didn't even take care of my bump that this obsessed Okenomiaki freak gave me." Earning the young man another bump on the head to mach the one he already had.<p>"You really didn't have to hit him like that you know." Akane said looking from the prone boy to the spatula wielding girl.<p>"He deserved it sister."<p>"Man what hit me? I feel worse now than I did when that bitch hit me." Ranma stated from the ground looking at the closed doorway.<p>"Boy Ranma, you sure are a glutton for punishments aren't you?" Kenchi said smirking down at him.<p>Ranma turned his head around and looked into the eyes of two angry women, one angry elder Amazon, the sightless scowl of a younger Amazon, the angry look of a bandana wearing boy, and the smirk of Kenchi Morisoto.<p>"Um would it help if I said I was sorry?"<p>"NO!" They shouted kicking the boy into the stratosphere, sending his father after him a few seconds after.<p>With that the group broke up heading for their own homes.<p>The next day found Kenchi waiting by the entrance to the public ice skating rink. He was supposed to meet his fiancé here for a date. He would have liked to have picked her up at her house, yet she had said that her father was still in a sour mood. It was ok though. He knew that the man had dreams that could no longer be honored. Yet the man should realize what an honor less bastard that the boy Ranma could be. Kenchi had visited with Shampoo and Cologne for a bit discussing the problems with Ranma and his father. They had also discussed Kenchi's intended marriage. That was embarrassing enough. Cologne had wanted him to get married right away. When he told her about his plans to wait due to age and the chance to finish school the woman had gotten a bit temperamental. The fight was refreshing to both of them and they and both laughed afterward for a time about it. When the old crown and suggested he bring the girl to China and get married their under proper Amazonian law, well he had to get out of there at that point. He may love the old bat, but she could be pushy at times.<p>He noticed Akane walking up and was about to go great her until he noticed that she was not alone. She had her two friends with her. The two girls were Yuka and Sayuri if he remembered their names right. They were flanking Akane to either side talking adamantly to their long time friend. Akane had her face bowed and looked extremely embarrassed. He could see that the two didn't pay attention to his fiancée's state of mind and saw that she was becoming more agitated as they got closer. He quickly went over some ways to get her out of her mood as he had wanted to really enjoy his time with her. He knew that his fiancé had a bit of a temper, and when she got embarrassed she would usually get angry to cover her embarrassment. It had been something that they had worked on for some time now, but his Akane had a ways to go yet before she got over her temper.<p>Upon noticing him Akane shouted "Kenchi!" and rushed into his arms. Kenchi took her into his arms smiling down at her lovingly. He would never get over his temperamental tomboy. Her spirit attracted him like no other. It was scary how quick he had fallen for this angle. Yet, he would not give it up for the world. He loved her, that was all there was to it. He had tried to take it slow. That was the one thing that he had wanted in his life. He wanted a nice relationship with a nice girl then eventual engagement and marriage. However, getting to know Akane he found he could not wait. He had his fears. Fears of her choosing someone else, fears of her being stolen from him, and even fears of her dieing on him because of the life they lived. Kenchi knew he had enemies out there that would be happy to strike at a loved one. A certain half dragon he had met some time ago came to mind and his views on women. The jerk was petty enough to take advantage of a situation like that. He would not kill her, but taking her and forcing her as a concubine would not be above him.<p>There was also the brat prince Toma. He and his art based on illusions would find Akane a fine catch indeed. There was also Kirin, yet he didn't pose too much of a threat as the man was still looking for the woman that had the other half of his scroll. Taro was another person he worried about at times though. The jerk lived to make his life miserable. Ever since he had found out his true name, (which was really silly) the jerk had been out to get him. Akane would do well to never have to meet any of those loons. However, with his life it was only a matter of time.<p>"So, Kenchi you are here to show Akane a good time?" Yuka asked a smirk donning her face as she looked him over.<p>"Don't say anything to them Kenchi, they will just turn it into something perverted."<p>Kenchi looked down into Akane's eyes seeing the love there and the blush on her beautiful face.<p>"Don't you worry Akane let them think whatever they want. You and I know how our relationship is and nothing is going to change that."<p>"Oh and what if she wants it to change into something more?"<p>"Shut up Sayuri!"<p>"Ahhh come on Akane you know we are just teasing you." Yuka said grabbing Sayuri's arm and dragging her into the building. "Meet you two love birds inside, don't get to distracted with each other and forget about us now."<p>"What was that about?" Kenchi asked looking after the two as they entered the building.<p>"Oh they were just teasing me about getting engaged so young."<p>"Is it a bad thing?" Kenchi asked as he looked down at the girl in his arms.<p>"It was just embarrassing. They were just goofing with me I know but they can get a bit annoying. Enough about that though let's go in and have some fun."<p>"I guess, though just to warn you Akane I have never been ice skating before."<p>"Really, well with your balance I am sure you will do fine."<p>"I am sure you are right Akane. After all how hard can it be right?"<p>"Right, so let's go!"<p>As the pair entered the lobby of the building they saw something that made their hearts sink.<p>"Well if it isn't the bitch and the bastard. What a pair made in heaven."<p>"Sigh, Ranma don't you ever get tired of this?" Kenchi asked eying the boy turned girl in front of him. "I see you are going for your more feminine look today."<p>"Shut up you bastard! Thanks to you I have lost everything!"<p>"More like thanks to your actions you have lost everything." Akane said smirking and stepping closer to Kenchi's side.<p>"I will have my revenge on you both mark my words."<p>"Whatever you say Saotome, I personally think you are wasting your time though. I see your bruises have not healed up yet from the last battle we fought." Akane's smirk got even bigger as she said this. "Come on Kenchi let's go I want to have fun not stick around and listen to this loser."<p>"I am here to serve, my lady."<p>The two made their way past the fuming Ranma, and up to the counter to rent their skates. After putting on their skates, the two stepped onto the ice where it was found that not knowing how to skate was more of a problem than it seemed as Kenchi fell right upon his bottom, pulling Akane along with him. The both of them started to laugh at the incident until Akane's friends Yuka and Sayuri skated up to them to help the two up.<p>"Wow I guess you aren't good at everything Morisoto." Yuka said a smirk on her face.<p>"Like I told Akane, I have never been ice skating before."<p>"Don't worry Kenchi we will teach you." Akane said hugging him from behind.<p>"You betcha stud muffin." This earned a scowl from Akane making Sayuri blush at her slip of the tong.<p>"As the time passed the three spent their time teaching Kenchi how to skate. He did bear a bit of teasing from the kids around and would have gone to change into his sister if not for the pleading eyes of his fiancé. She had just wanted to be with him and only him. After the last few days he could understand why, what with her father acting the way he was. So he just grinned and resumed trying to skate as best he could with his fiancé. After about an hour the four found themselves at a table in the food court resting and drinking sodas bought by Kenchi. Akane also held a stuffed puppy to her chest that Kenchi had won for her out of a crane machine.<p>"So, Akane, why didn't you ask Linchi along to this little get together? I know Nabiki said we should come along to make sure nothing improper happens with you two." Yuka stated smirking at the engaged couple.<p>"My sister is at home helping aunty right now. She said she would try and make it if she could, but she had a lot to do. What do you mean keep an eye on us anyway?" Kenchi asked arching his eyebrow.<p>"Oh you know, Nabiki was just worried that Akane would try and drag you off to a love motel or something."<p>"SAYURI!"<p>"What, it's true." Yuka said, her smirk growing more intense as the two blushed crimson.<p>"We plan to wait until we are married for that." Kenchi said his face so hot you could fry an egg off of it.<p>"Well you know how those plans tend to go awry. Next thing you know the passions just hit you and bam you are in the sack going at it like rabbits." Sayuri said her smile turning evil as she glanced at her friend. "Besides you may want to wait until you are married, but that doesn't mean that Akane wants to wait that long."<p>"SAYURI! That is enough!" Akane cried out her face crimson as a cherry.<p>Thankfully for the engaged pair, they were interrupted by the shouts of "Marline! Marline! Come to mommy my little Marline!"<p>The next thing Akane knew someone was grabbing at the stuffed puppy in her arms. She held on tightly to the gift not wishing to relinquish the item given to her by her fiancée.<p>"What do you think you are doing?"<p>"Give Azusa her Marline! Azusa wants her little Marline!"<p>"This is not yours it is mine given to me by my fiancée. So let go of it you brat!"<p>"No, Azusa wants her little Marline. Marline belongs to Azusa."<p>At that moment the argument was interrupted by a handsome man with blue eyes and light brown hair dressed in a skater's uniform. Plucking the annoying girl away from Akane the man turned to her and in a suave and confident tone of voice replied. "Forgive my partner, she sometimes takes things, giving them a new name, and claming them as her own."<p>There were whispers in the background at this saying things, like "Isn't that illegal?", or "Does she really get away with that?"<p>Akane turned to the man after scowling at the obnoxious girl to thank him for stopping her from taking her gift when she noticed the man bending down as if to kiss her. "As a thank you I will give you a gift of gratitude."<p>Before he could touch her lips he received a double punch to the face. One from Akane, who wouldn't let anyone kiss her except her Kenchi, and Kenchi himself who wouldn't let anyone touch his fiancée against her, will. The man went flying to the far side of the ice rink crashing into the far wall making a perfect impression of him in the wall.<p>"That is the type of creep that gives creeps a bad name."<p>"Yeah, Akane I am sorry for butting in like that. However, I really hate guys like him. I know that you could have taken him by yourself though. I just couldn't stand the thought of him getting close to you like that. Call me jealous or whatever, but just the thought of him kissing you makes my blood boil." Kenchi said looking off to where the pervert had flown.<p>"Don't worry about it love I feel the same way. After all these lips are reserved for one person only, and it defiantly was not that pervert."<p>"Oh and whom would that be?" He asked turning towards her as he noticed her eyes shining as she looked at him.<p>"Well if there were not so many people around I would show you."<p>"See what we mean Kenchi, Akane is ready and willing to hit the sack with you."<p>"SAYURI!" Akane yelled turning to her friend who had just destroyed the mood.<p>"Oh Akane don't deny that you were giving your fiancée bedroom eyes just now. This is just the kind of thing that Nabiki was worried about. You going off with your fiancée and getting yourself pregnant because of it."<p>"Well, I won't ever have the chance with you and my sisters around stopping me."<p>"Akane, you are not ready to become a mom. You have school and a carrier to think about." Yuka said while glancing at her friend.<p>"Oh come on Yuka. I know what I want to do with my life. I know that I want to go to collage and get a degree in something, maybe acting or physical education. I also know that I will probably end up running the dojo while Kenchi works. I look forward to doing that. I want to be a Martial Artist on the same caliber as him. I am also aware that sooner or later, most likely sooner I will be getting pregnant. I want it to be Kenchi that is the father of my children. However, thanks to my father and his views I would be pregnant already with Ranma's baby. I love Kenchi and will wait until he is ready for that, but I am also afraid that if I wait for to long one of our rivals will take advantage of one of us. I don't want to see that happen. I know it is not the best way to go about solidifying a relationship to just go out and do the deed. I also know that it would be hard on the both of us if I did get pregnant in high school. However, I wouldn't mind if it did happen. I know that I will be taken care of if it happened, and I am happy with the man I got. We will have the money to take care of a baby, if that happened. We also have the means for me to complete school."<p>"So you would throw your life away, Akane?"<p>"No, Sayuri I would not be throwing my life away and I did not say that I was going to just go out to the nearest love motel and get knocked up. Both Kenchi and I have agreed to wait until we are married before we start a family. I wouldn't mind starting one early, yet my man is sensible and good hearted. He has a good head on his shoulders and keeps me in line." Akane glanced up into the face of her fiancée knowing he was the one that kept her in check. Smiling adoringly at him, she reached up and gave him a peck on the cheek.<p>"Akane, you know that I love you, but I don't think we are really ready to start a family yet."<p>"Oh, I know you don't think so yet Kenchi. As I said you are my sensible future husband."<p>"I see the slut is in heat there. You should be careful or you will end up trapped with her."<p>The Four turned to see Ranma still in female form smirking at them with his arms crossed across her chest.<p>"Of coarse if you were a real man you would just use her then dump her like the slut she is."<p>"Ranma, if we wanted advice from a perverted bastard we would go look up the ancient enemy of the Amazons, Happosie. We don't need comments from you so why don't you just go away."<p>"Kenchi's right we don't want you here so why don't you just leave us alone. You have no claim on my sisters or I so just go."<p>"Ohhhhh, Caroline. Azusa wants her Caroline."<p>The four watched as the annoying ditz latched onto Ranma's shirt and tried to remove it from her forcibly. Ranma was about to slap the annoying girl away when the young man from before again interrupted the ditz from her prize.<p>"I am truly sorry about that. At times she just can't control herself." He said with his most suave smile on his face. "Let me introduce myself. I am Mikado Sazanine (AN: Sorry about spelling of his name if it is not right.) I am again sorry for my partner. Here is a gift of for your troubles."<p>Unlike Akane, Ranma was not prepared enough to stop Mikado from laying a wet kiss to her lips. She stood there in shock for a minute then began to slowly step away from the pervert that had just kissed her. Then she broke out into a run fleeing the area screaming.<p>"Ahhh, such a shy little thing, to be intimidated so by my kiss."<p>"You would be crying to if you knew who you just kissed." Akane softly spoke while Sayuri, Yuka, and Kenchi nodded looking a bit green in the gills.<p>"Hmmm, what was that my dear? I am surprised you would refuse my greeting. I offer another chance. Just think you would be the one thousandth girl I have kissed. Isn't that a special privilege?"<p>"Not likely letch! I have already got a man I enjoy kissing and you are not him."<p>"My dear you wound me. I am after all the most sought after man in all of Nerima."<p>"Really, that is news to me. I have never even heard of you."<p>The young man looked affronted as those words came out of the girl's mouth. He had never had a girl be so obstinate to him before. In a way it was quite refreshing. The girl would make for an interesting challenge. After all no sensible girl could resist his charms for long. It was simply unheard of, he had even turned a few lesbian girls to the proper path with his charming ways. He had led the most devoted of girlfriends astray in his time. This girl would be no different. In time she would be like his other conquests. Her lips would be his as any other girl. How to go about it though? Ahh, yes a challenge to her current amore should do the trick. He had garnered many a precious lips in a challenge match in the past.<p>"How could you not have heard of me? I am well known in the Ice Skating Pairs circuit. I am one half of the illustrious Golden Pair. The rising stars of Martial Arts Figure Skating. You must have heard of me."<p>"Nope haven't heard a thing about you. Though I must admit I am not too fond of figure skating. Kenchi honey, have you heard of them."<p>"Can't say that I have dear, though you know I am not to into skating as well. You know how I am with ice though. It is kind of weird that I have not heard of them though. I usually hear about most of the prominent artists, are you sure you are really good?"<p>Mikado stood in shock at the brazen disregard for his skills. How could these two put him down so? He was the finest in the land, and these two come and say they have never heard of him. Well fine then if they wanted to be punished then it was up to them.<p>"Fine then, I challenge you both. You will face my partner and I in an Anything Goes martial arts ice..."<p>"Hold on there turkey. You have challenged us so by rights my fiancé and I get to name the type of challenge we should be facing in."<p>"Don't be so vulgar. This is not a martial arts challenge; this is a martial arts ice skating pair's challenge. You may of coarse choose…"<p>"Sorry turkey, but you should know it doesn't work that way. As a martial arts challenge myself and my fiancé both have the right to choose the type of challenge we are to have."<p>"Yes, yes I know and you have that option on the rules of the match, however I did challenge you to a Ice Skating match. If you wish to concede then I will not hold it against you. After all you would be facing the best of the sport."<p>"You know Kenchi, we might as well take him up on his challenge. After all it is obvious that he and his partner have never faced a true opponent before. It would be nice to wipe that smug look off his face. I would really love to grind his face in the ice, and if we take him up on his challenge I would get that chance."<p>"Alright Akane we will take him up on his challenge. I do hope you know what you are doing. I could never say no to you though."<p>"Yes you can Kenchi, after all I am not pregnant yet." Akane said smirking at her friends.<p>Before there could be more discussion on the matter there was a crash near the group. All of them turned to see Ranma in his male form barring down on them with murder in his eyes. Kenchi grabbed Akane and leaped away from the oncoming artist. It turned out he needn't have bothered. Ranma's fist connected with Sazanine's cheek with a resounding "CRACK". He flew back again into the far wall. Sazanine got up and worked his jaw determining the damage caused by the unexpected punch.<p>"You! I am going to kill you for what you have done you ass. I am going to tear you limb from limb. I will make you pay!"<p>"My, what a crude person you are. What, pray tell have I done to you, hmmm?<p>"It doesn't matter; all you need to know is that you have made me really mad. SO DIE!"<p>"Tut, tut, you obviously do not understand what you are getting into."<p>"I don't care what you have to say. Just DIE!"<p>"You might not care at the moment, but after the gentleman next to you has a few words with you I am sure you will care."<p>They all turned to see a security guard scowling harshly at Ranma. He walked over to the boy and took him by the arm taking him away.<p>"That was kind of low sex neurotic nympho, don't you think?" Kenchi asked turning to the young man.<p>"Why whatever do you mean my good sir? He clearly attacked me with out provocation. Oh, and it is Sanzanine."<p>"Sure whatever you say Makado the Molester."<p>"I told you its Sanzanine!"<p>"Huh, hu sure thing. Let's go Akane I really don't feel like skating anymore right now. The company has kind of soured my mood."<p>"I know what you mean Kenchi. I think we can find some other fun things to do today other than listen to this molester."<p>The two left leaving a fuming Sazanine behind. Akane's friends soon followed them out of the place giggling all the way. The two soon caught up with the pair, all four of them making their way out of the building.<p>"Oh man Akane you sure know how to keep things interesting."<p>"Yeah, Yuka's right. You really know how to show a date a good time."<p>"I would be showing my date a better time if you both weren't here."<p>"Akane we have been over this before. We are here to make sure you don't get into any trouble. We have to make sure you keep your virtue intact."<p>"Yeah what Yuka said."<p>"Besides Akane you and I both know that if we really wanted to lose them we could. It is not like we have to worry about them finding us if we really wanted to disappear from them."<p>"I really do want to be alone with you though Kenchi. Those two won't even let me kiss you properly without getting on my case."<p>"Depends on the type of kissing Akane, the type you seem to like to get into tends to lead to a point that spells a baby in the near future." Yuka stated shaking her head at her friend. "Besides you could ditch us like he said, but then again your sister would have someone find you. You would also cause trouble for us with your sister by doing that. You don't want to get us in trouble with your sister do you?"<p>"What I want Yuka, is to spend some quality time with my fiancé. So we can talk, snuggle, and kiss if we want to. Even if we did go that far it would be our decision to do that. I don't need to be chaperoned everywhere just because my sister is worried I will be pregnant by the end of the day."<p>"Well if you weren't so hot to trot then we might be able to trust you a bit more. I know if I had a hunk like Kenchi here I would not be able to be trusted as well." Sayuri sighed out gazing dreamily at Akane's fiancé.<p>"If you want to make babies Sayuri then go find your own. This one is taken." Akane said grabbing onto Kenchi's arm, and snuggling up against him.<p>"You both know I am right here right? Anyway Yuka, Sayuri, both Akane and I have things to discuss so we are going to head into the park up ahead and sit for a while. The both of you could at least give us a little space to ourselves. You don't have to worry about anything happening in such a public place. You could keep us in sight. However, what we wish to discuss is private so if you would please leave us for a bit we would be most appreciative."<p>"I don't know Kenchi, Nabiki did say we needed to keep a good eye on you both. With the way Akane is going on it might not be a good idea to be more than five feet away from you both."<p>"There is a difference between running off to a love motel, and a bench in the park Yuka. We will behave ourselves. Now, if you will excuse us my fiancée and I have some things to discuss."<p>Kenchi pulled Akane over to the park bench leaving the other two girls behind them. With a sigh he sat his fiancée down. Sitting next to her he looked into her eyes his expression stern.<p>"Akane, I know you were supposed to be joking around back there, but I get the feeling that you were also being serious about getting pregnant. Why would you want that when we are still in our first year of high school? We have our whole life ahead of us to have children. We aren't even married yet and you seem to not even want to wait for that. I love you very much. I know you love me. Why do you feel we need to rush into having a family? I know I would really like to have children with you, but I don't want you to rush into something just because you feel it is the only thing that is going to keep me with you."<p>"Oh Kenchi, it's not that. I know you love me. I really love you too. I know you would wait forever for me if that is what it took. However, like I said before to Yuka and Sayuri, my family is a different story. My father in particular has been causing problems. Luckily my sisters and I have been safe enough, but he has been trying to get us alone with Ranma for some time now. In the last week he has tried to get me alone with Ranma almost twice a day. It is also the reason that my sisters and I are sticking to groups of people. I am sure I can handle Ranma in normal circumstances like you have taught me, but then there are the surprise attacks that he is known for. You saw today how he was at the ice rink. He has been doing that all the time. It is getting to me."<p>Akane leaned on Kenchi's shoulder drawing comfort from the feeling of safety he gave to her. She was always comfortable with him. He never pushed her to do anything she did not want to do. He was there with her not lording over her. He did not take what was not freely given. She loved him all the more for that.<p>"Besides, just because we have sex doesn't mean I will get pregnant right away. We could use protection."<p>"I have the feeling though that the protection could fail sooner that liked if we did start Akane. You have got it in that cute little head of yours that you need to get pregnant. A child would be very difficult to take care of Akane. Yes, you have help with your sisters, and I would never abandon you if you did end up pregnant. However, you don't have to face that responsibility yet. We are still young. We still need to get married and settle. Settling will be very hard with a baby. How about when I am in collage? Do you think you will really have time to go to school yourself with a baby to take care of? You even said you would like to go. You can't leave a baby in the care of others Akane. That would not be fair to the child."<p>"So I don't go then. Ether way I will be stuck at home. Kenchi, you need to understand that if it is not Ranma that takes me it will be someone else like Kuno. I will never be able to live the life I truly want to live. You have given me the closest thing I could ever even come close to that life. I don't want to lose that. My father is going ballistic since Kasumi left the house for collage. Now he wants to make sure Nabiki and I are under his thumb. Though he can't openly get me to marry Ranma anymore he has been putting pressure on both Nabiki and I to conform to his whims. I want to be married to you. I want to bare your children. I would like to finish school and go to collage. Of those I feel that marring you and baring your children are the only things I will really be able to have."<p>"That's not true Akane. You can have everything you want. I will marry you. We just have to be careful. Ranma will not lay a hand on you if I have anything to say about it."<p>"That's the point Kenchi. You can't be around all the time. My father will never allow me to get married to you unless I have a very good reason he can not dispute to marry you. Even eloping I would still have to wait until you are of age to marry. That is a few years away. In that time there are all sorts of things that could happen. I would love to have my father's permission to marry you. I would love to take the time to just be with you like this and enjoy being a teenage girl. I won't be able to though. My father wants me to grow up too fast. He did the same thing to Kasumi and Nabiki. They both had to grow up faster than they should have when mom died. All he thinks about is the school yet he doesn't care that his daughters have dreams of their own. I do want to take over the dojo. I would love to teach and take care of kids that come to me to learn the art. I would love to be able to teach our children someday."<p>"In a lot of ways I feel the same Akane. I also want to pass down my art to the next generation. I also want to have my children follow in my footsteps. It is kind of scary though how we have to grow up so fast. Do you understand what that means Akane? There will be no shopping with your friends. I know you do those things. Can you really be like that? Think of how your older sister Kasumi was. She is what you would have to face. Can you live your life like that. You know what it almost did to her."<p>"There is a difference to that Kenchi. My sister was made to be a mother to both Nabiki and I. She was made into a picture perfect wife to my father. Instead of finding her dreams of becoming a doctor she was forced to be a housemaid. She never had the chance to live at all. She never got the chance to even choose her path. She was forced in to it. I on the other hand have a choice in the matter. I can't run off like Kasumi because of my age. I can however, choose a path that will suit me the best. Nabiki even has a great plan for her life. What I have is an empty dojo. A building that has lost a lot of the life in it since mom died. No, that is not true. Some of the life has come back to the dojo, but it was you that brought it back. You helped wake us up again. I love you more than ever for that Kenchi, I would die for you. That is the kind of love my mother had for my father. I know it is. That is what I want. If I have to grow up a little faster to get that then I will. I love you Kenchi and I want to be with you. If that means I have to get pregnant to do that I will. My father will not let me have you any other way."<p>"Akane I am sure there is another way around this than getting pregnant at sixteen. He was forced to acknowledge our engagement when challenged. Maybe that is the way to go. I could challenge him for your hand in marriage. As part of the challenge we can make it so you can decide on the time of your marriage. So if you want to marry me sometime like next Sunday then we will get married then."<p>"So you can't wait to get into my panties either? Why don't we just skip everything and just do it Kenchi? It would be…"<p>"Akane, that is not what I meant and you know it. This way we can get married but not have to worry about having kids right away. We can take our time, finish school and live a little before settling down so fast. We can travel and see things. We can be kids for a bit still."<p>"Ok Kenchi, we can do it your way. However, if my father backs out of the agreement in some way then you have to promise me that you will get me pregnant so I will be with you. I do not want to be my father's puppet. So you need to make sure I have my own life or we live our life as a instant family. Do you agree to that? I will accept no other terms on the matter."<p>"Ok Akane I will consider it if all of our options are taken up. Do you at least agree with that? This is something you should never rush into. I love you Akane, but rushing into having children when we are still in school is hard enough as it is."<p>"I know Kenchi, and I am prepared for that. I told you I love you, and I want you to know that I will do anything for you. I would give myself to you anytime you want. I love you so much; I just want to be with you always. I am just so afraid that someone will try to take me away from you, or someone will take you from me. I never want that to face that kind of situation Kenchi. I never want to be in a situation where I would have to live without you. You can understand that right?"<p>"Akane, we are going to be together. We both can take care of ourselves, and I am sure that we can handle this situation that…"<p>"What is this that I see this day that greaves my heart so. My fierce tigress Akane Tendo in the arms of the foul sorcerer Morisoto I can not stand for this! I will smite thee, and take back my rightful place as the one true love of thy fair maiden. As said by thy maiden's father, I shall be the one that shares her love in the most holy of sacraments."<p>"Excuse me Kuno, but we were having a conversation here. I also thought I expressed that you were never to come near Akane with the intents you have so brazenly insinuated. Will I have to send you to the hospital again for bothering my fiancée?"<p>"Ah, but I have thy weakness you foul sorcerer. I have at last learned of your weakness to water that when ever you seem to be around it you seem to disappear. I will finally be rid of the likes of you and thy fierce tigress will finally be free to express her love for thyn self, for I have with me holy water what will finally banish thou to the depths of hell for which thou truly belong oh enemy of women."<p>"Kuno, I have said this before, and I will probably have to say this again, you need help. I am not an evil sorcerer. I am not a demon from the lowest pits of hell. I am a martial artist, and right now you are really pissing me off."<p>"He is not the only one that is getting pissed off here. Kuno, I have told you this before, I will never date you. I hate you almost as much as I hate Saotome Ranma. I will never want to be with you. What I would like to know though is how my father has anything to do with this? "<p>"That, my dear tigress is a promise between the both of us. For thy father hast said that if I were to defeat the braggart Morisoto then I wouldst be able to marry a Tendo daughter. In his wisdom he has given me the weapons and will of heavens decree that we shall be wed as soon as this braggart is out of our way."<p>"KUNO YOU IDIOT!" Akane screamed as she lunged from the bench and punched the delusional kendo artist into the stratosphere. "Kenchi, you sure you don't want to knock me up? There is a love hotel right down the street you know. I am sure I am in the most fertile time of the month right now. Then we can face my father, with having my virtue taken he will be compelled to have to let me marry you."<p>"Akane..." Kenchi said wrapping his arms around her.<p>"Don't try and talk me out of this Kenchi. You heard what Kuno said. My own father will be sending fighters after you to take me away. I know you are good Kenchi, but even the best can have bad days. I don't want to take that risk. I heard him Kenchi, they will not only come after you, and they will come after me too. I don't want this Kenchi. Why can't we just get it over with? There would be no more worries. I could live with staying at home and raising your children Kenchi. I want to have your baby."<p>Akane started to sob making Kenchi hold on her tighten even more. He knew that he loved the girl in his arms too much to burden her with the responsibilities a child would put on their lives. The both of them were still too young to have children. Yet, he could not get over the way her father was pushing her into this type of decision. He knew of kids that have done things more drastic that what Akane was planning to get away from parents who were overbearing as Akane's father was being. A part of him wanted to even give in to her. He really did want her. He wanted her so badly that it took all of his control not to give in and have a night of carnal pleasure. There was also a part of him that wanted to do right by her. He wanted her life to be the best he could offer her. Could he really offer her that life starting at the age of sixteen? He knew that as of right now they would be taken care of if something were to happen. Yet, what would she think in just two more years? He wished he could talk to someone about this. Someone that was impartial. Sadly the only person that would come close to that would be his aunt. However, her behavior was rather sporadic at times. Could he really trust her to not go over the top in this sort of discussion? With a mental sigh he made his decision.<p>"Akane?" He asked releasing one of his arms to reach for her chin. He turned her face towards him looking into her eyes saying. "Tonight come over to my place."<p>"So, you are really going to do it my love?" Akane asked hope coming to her eyes.<p>"Akane, when you arrive we will talk. I still don't think we are ready for that kind of commitment. However, we will see ok? There is just someone I wish to talk to ok? Please understand we are still so young Akane. If we cross this line there will be no turning back. I love you Akane remember that. No matter what happens I will always love you." He leaned down and kissed her lips.<p>Akane looked lovingly into his eyes as their lips separated. Smiling through her tears she said. "Whatever happens tonight Kenchi I will always love you as well. I will always love you no matter what."<p>With a chuckle Kenchi reluctantly released Akane from his grip on her turning her towards him. "We had better get back to your friends Akane. I am sure they must be worried about you."<p>"Sigh, I guess so. It is getting kind of late as is. We should separate now I guess too. I will see you tonight my love."<p>"I will see you tonight Akane."<p>With that the two separated, Akane heading back to her friends and Kenchi heading home where he hoped to have a serious conversation with his mostly hyperactive aunt. When Akane reached her friends they were surprised at first that she was alone. After explaining her run in with Kuno, Akane turned to start her way home. The two friends shared a nervous glace as they realized that the situation had just gotten worse for their friend. The three then raced to Akane's home. Yuka and Sayuri even more determined to keep their love sick friend safe.<p>At the Tendo home Nabiki was watching the television switching through channels board as there was nothing for her to do that day. Her sister was out on a date with her fiancé. Her father was out somewhere doing whatever he did nowadays. He was probably out sulking as he had not been able to coral Akane as he wished. It was sad that he still could not get over the fact that his daughters just wanted to follow their own dreams. It was not like they were just going to abandon the dojo. Akane even expressed her wish to run the place. She just didn't want to run it with a pervert like Saotome. Nabiki knew Saotome's type from the get go. They were the type of people that would bleed them dry and then toss them to the curb after they were done with them. Nabiki did not want to get caught up in that. She may be selfish, she may even use her family for her own gains at times, but she was still down to earth enough to know that siding with her father on this was a very bad idea. Nabiki hated being poor. That was just a matter of fact. Nabiki also hated being used. She was one that would rather use others than be used herself. She was a bit jealous of the perks her sisters have started getting already. Even though she deserved to, Nabiki envied the fact that Kasumi had gotten out of the house and life she had trapped herself in. It is not to say that she would change anything for she was truly happy for her sister. Yet, she also wanted more for herself. Without Kasumi around it would be hard to keep things straight around the homestead.<p>Then there was Akane, she had everything Nabiki could ever want. A wealthy fiancé who was decent, and not a loon as Kuno was. He truly loved her for who she was. She was not just a prize to be won. Most of all he was very wealthy. It was amazing that her sister could find such a catch. She even had him wrapped around her little finger. If her father would get his head out of his butt he would realize that Kenchi was the best thing for the dojo. The family would be set for life with him wed to one of the Tendo girls. Too bad he only had eyes for her sister or she would have scooped him up in a heartbeat. She wouldn't have minded breaking them up if not for the Saotomes. They would ruin the family; she knew this with all her heart. It had been kind of weird that Genma was so desperate to get his son married so fast. Looking into that Nabiki had realized that Genma would mooch off of everything that the dojo would have taken in. Again she knew that he would have driven them out into the streets. Genma would have squandered everything the family had worked for. Their mother's hard work would have been for nothing if he had gotten his grubby hands on the property. No, it was best to keep the Saotomes out of the equation.<p>"Nabiki?"<p>Nabiki turned to see her father standing behind her holding two cups of tea. "yes father?" She asked getting up from the couch.<p>"Would you come here for a minute I would like to talk with you?"<p>With a sigh Nabiki followed her father to the dining room and sat in her usual spot. Her father seated himself where he usually sat at the head of the table smiling at her which made her nervous for some reason.<p>He put one of the cups of tea in front of her then started to drink out of his own cup. After taking a good swallow he set his cup down and look directly at her saying "Nabiki, I have been very disappointed as of late. The family is breaking apart. It should not be this way. Your mother would not have approved of the way that you girls have been acting as of late, and it should be rectified immediately.<p>"You're right daddy mother would not have approved of what has been going on here. However, I believe it is your actions that she would not have approved of. You have been insufferable daddy. We know that you want to continue the school, yet you are the one that is holding the school back."<p>"Sigh, I do not see how you have come to this conculsion Nabiki I have done all I can for this family. I have done everything to make sure we are secure for the future."<p>"Forgive me daddy for being blunt, bit bull. You have done nothing to support this family. Everything we have survived on has been due to mother's works not yours. Mother was the one that raised the trust we are living off of right now. You don't even have a permanent source of income to speak of. What little you pull in dose keep the food on the table, however the home is all mother. You barely even keep this place up. What students we usually get here you run off soon after. Face it daddy you have failed this place and mother's memory not us."<p>Soun picked up his cup again and took another drink before again setting his cup down. "If that is so Nabiki then why is it that I am so well respected in this community?"<p>"Oh, that is an easy one daddy. They just don't know the real you. They again put your face in front of mom's accomplishments. Face it daddy, even though this pains me to say you are the one that is tearing everything apart." Nabiki then reached for her cup of tea, lifting it she took a big swallow and set the cup back down. She turned to her father about to again tear into him when she felt her muscles lock up. She sat frozen in place unable to move a millimeter. With growing horror she watched as her father smiled at her though it was not a kind smile.<p>"Soon, my dear Nabiki you will understand that I will have my dream. You girls have been far too independent lately. You should know your place even if I have to make you understand. Isn't that right Saotome?"<p>Nabiki heard a shuffling behind her then she saw Mr. Saotome step into sight coming to a stop beside her father. He also smiled at her evilly making her heart pound in fear.<p>"We should get her ready for when my son comes home. We will have an heir to the dojo my friend. There is nothing these little girls can do about it."<p>A choked scream escaped Nabiki's throat as the two men loomed over her, reaching for her vulnerable body.<p>AN: OMG I thought I would never get done with this chapter. Sorry for the cliffy but I had to end this thing somewhere. It has been years since I have finally gotten back to this story. I have never forgotten it just have never had the time to really work on it. I hope it will not take me another few years to get the next chapter out as I know all my readers who are still looking into this story would strangle me if I just left it here.<p>There are a few points I want to make about this chapter before people start to send flames my way for the way some of the characters are acting. Namely Akane, I know she is acting way OOC. There is a reason for this. I think I explained it pretty well in the chapter however, I can understand that some people may have issues with this. She is afraid. That is the gist of it right there. The stress her father is putting her under and the suitors is driving her into desperate measures. Going back over the story I do not know if I will have Kenchi and Akane do the deed to get by over her father. I may or may not do that still. If it douse happen then it will be off screen. I do not do lemons. I am also keeping this story in the T category so no graphic details of sexual conduct. They may talk about it but that is all that will happen in this story.<p>The next chapter will have many revelations to it. As I hope I have set up kind of well in this chapter there will be a lot of confessions coming next chapter. As for Nabiki's plight well, that you will have to read when I get the next chapter out. I hope you are still enjoying this story even though I know my grammar and spelling are not the best. Thanks to all those that have stuck with me and are cheering me one in this. Well until next chapter.<p>Sorry for the formatting issues. For some reason the upload didn't take right.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
