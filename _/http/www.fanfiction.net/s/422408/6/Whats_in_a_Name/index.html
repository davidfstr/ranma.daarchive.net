</div><p>I do not nor have I ever owned any character relating to Ranma 1/2. Though I wish I did own them that way I would be living in the life of luxury at this moment I do not have that much talent or funds. So the point is I am writing this story for fun and will never get any payment from it. I will never be able to sell this story for any sort of profit. I will still suffer being next to penniless</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>What's In a Name?</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Revelations</b></p><p>People have different reactions to stress. Some people go out and talk or have fun to relieve the built up stress in their life. Some people keep all their stress bottled up and try to act as if nothing is bothering them. Then there are people like Soun Tendo. Who wine like a little baby until he floods the neighborhood or dehydrates whichever comes first.</p><p>Normally this is what would have been happening within the Tendo walls if not for one extraordinary fact. Soun had received such a shock that he didn't know what to do. So he just sat at the table waiting for his oldest daughter to come down the stairs and tell him she had only played a practical joke on her beloved father. That she was not going to be leaving him as her mother had done. After all she knew that the family depended on her. She knew that he depended on her. She couldn't be serous about leaving to go to school. What would she need school for anyway? She is a girl not a boy. She should not need to go to school. No she needed to get married to a man that he picked for her. She should be obedient to him and her husband when she married.</p><p>The only thing was, Kasumi was not coming down and telling him it was all some joke. In fact she was still upstairs doing whatever she was doing, while the rest of the family was sitting around the table talking to those people. It was their fault he knew. Mainly it was that boy Ken something or other faults. He was the one that had started this mess. If he had left his daughter alone then all of this would not be taking place.</p><p>Akane would be well married to Ranma and making an heir to the dojo as she should. Kasumi would still be in the kitchen making dinner. In that case he could at this point be making plans for Nabiki.</p><p>Yes it was that entire boy's fault. He would have to be dealt with somehow. The only problem was how to take care of the boy. After all he had somehow beaten Ranma and Genma. He must have cheated of course, but he still won the fight. So that meant that he as the patriarch of the Tendo clan was honor bound by the conditions set in the match to allow his daughter to marry the disgusting boy. Allowing his family to merge with the family of that boy was a thought that disgusted Soun to no end. The family was probably unclean or of a sort that would steal the dojo from the family from right under their fingers. The only thing that he could hope for was that his friend could think of a way to reestablish the claim of the Saotome clan. Then he could get rid of that disgusting boy and be done with it. Then he could get Kasumi and Akane back in their places and then start on Nabiki as a good father should be able to do. The only problem with that was the waiting. He had to wait on his friend to do something before he could act. He just hoped his friend would act soon or all would be lost. For now he had to wait and listen to the snot nosed boy's Aunt, rave about his attributes. Ha what a joke, the boy was nothing really special. Ranma was more of a man than this boy and he turned into a girl. If only he could get out of that dammed agreement. What to do what to do?</p><p>While Soun was deliberating the problem in his mind, Akane and Nabiki were getting to know the woman they had come to know as Auntie. Kenchi had disappeared somewhere and the two were getting rather nervous with her attention on them. It was Nabiki who stopped her from her praising of her nephew.</p><p>"Madam, we all know the benefits of Kenchi, but you really have not been introduced to us properly. "</p><p>"Oh dear, where are my manners today? I am Hitachi Masaki. Daughter of Morisoto Dachuchi and Yuma. Widowed wife to Hitachi Sato. OH THIS IS SUCH A NEAT LITTLE PLACE! HOW CUTE!"</p><p>Akane looked over at her sister as she began to get a twitch in her eyebrow. She couldn't understand why her sister was doing that. Usually she only did that when she found out she had lost a bit of money or something.</p><p>"Excuse me?" Nabiki began again. "Did you say Hitachi Masaki, as in the president of the Hitachi financial group? As in the Hitachi Masaki who is the president of the Hitachi financial group? As in the Hitachi Masaki who is one of if not the richest woman in the world? Do you mean you are that Hitachi Masaki?"</p><p>"Oh dear you have heard of me? Hmmm, I must get Kenchi to have you over to the office some time as we will be related and all. OH IT WOULD BE SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU SEE WHERE YOUR HUSBAND WILL WORK WHEN HE IS OUT OF SCHOOL!" Masaki said as she grabbed Akane in a first class glomp.</p><p>While Akane was getting the breath squeezed out of her Nabiki had gone into a state of total shock. Her mind was pondering how her little sister, her tomboyish little sister. Her I want to be a martial artist little sister. How she had just bagged the most eligible bachelor of their age group. Her little sister was going to marry the heir to one of the wealthiest families in Japan. Their fortune made the Kuno fortune look like chump change. This boy was loaded. And he belonged to her sister. Not for the first time did Nabiki direct the green eyed stair towards her little sister who was just getting out of her soon to be mother in law's death grip.</p><p>"I am sure he would enjoy taking me there Auntie, however I was under the impression that Kenchi was going to be teaching martial arts in a dojo?"</p><p>"I am." Came a voice from the kitchen. The three women turned to see Kenchi walk into the room with a tea set on a tray in his hands. "I am also going to be running Aunties company when I graduate. I know that your father has done a good job with this place but just teaching martial arts is something I don't see as a very profitable job. I do it because I love it and it is my life, but I have other things in my life as well. The company is one, Akane has become another."</p><p>"You're so sweet." Akane said giving Kenchi a kiss on the cheek waking Soun up out of his shock.</p><p>"Akane what are you doing!"</p><p>"Giving my fiancé a kiss daddy, what does it look like?"</p><p>"Akane I will not have you acting like a brazen tart in this house. I can't believe that you would do such a thing in front of your father. If your mother were alive tod..."</p><p>Soun was unable to say anymore as a fist impacted into his face. As the fist belonged to his youngest daughter, who by the way had been training with Kenchi for some time now, he was none the less surprised to find himself through the wall and imbedded within the outer wall again. His eyes grew wide as she came out of the wall through the hole he had just made on his way out to the outer wall with a blue aura surrounding her. He also glanced the tiers in her eyes but they were somewhat ignored from the fear he felt when eyeing his angry, and also violent daughter.</p><p>It turned out his fear was justified when she proceeded to turn him into a human pretzel. With a snap here a cry of pain there and a twist there Soun came out looking like a piece of abstract art. The only thing that stopped his daughter from continuing on her artistic talents was the arms of her fiancé as they wrapped around her trembling form.</p><p>"Shhhh Akane, stop this now. You need to calm down."</p><p>"He had no right to say that about mother, Kenchi. He had no right."</p><p>"I know love, I know. Here let's go out for a walk ok. We can come back a little later after everyone has cooled down some ok?"</p><p>She looked into his soft blue eye's and relented saying in a meek voice, "ok, Kenchi."</p><p>He then led her out of the gate to the Tendo property and down the street.</p><p>As the two left the only other two women in the vicinity stood over the twisted form of Soun.</p><p>"Daddy that was really uncalled for. Do you know what you could have done to us if you have insulted our guests?" Turning to Mrs. Hitachi Nabiki began to apologize for the rudeness of her father. "I am truly sorry for that Mrs. Hitachi; my father has it in his head that Akane was to marry the son of his friend. Kenchi of coarse won the right to annul the agreement between him and his friend, Saotome Genma."</p><p>At the name Saotome Mrs. Hitachi glared at Nabiki. "Did you say Saotome Genma, as in the Saotome Genma who married Saotome Nodoka?"</p><p>"I don't know his wife's name but Saotome Genma was the one who brought his son here to marry one of us. He is even still around somewhere. I can find out if that is his wife's name though."</p><p>"Don't bother. That bitch doesn't deserve to be looked up for any reason. She is a no good skank who doesn't deserve the time of day. The whore shouldn't have been allowed to breed. She is a no good tramp of a woman that does not deserve the respect that she thinks she should have. THAT BITCH DESERVES A PLACE IN THE DEEPEST PITS OF HELL!"</p><p>"Um ok then I guess you wouldn't need for me to look her up then right?" Nabiki asked as she stepped back from the hyperventilating woman. Mrs. Hitachi calmed herself and turned to the young woman before her.</p><p>"I am sorry dear; I sort of got carried away there. I should go for today. Tell Kenchi when he comes back that I will see him at home. Oh and dear please, DO NOT BRING UP THAT BITCHES NAME IN FRONT OF ME OR KENCHI DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded her eyes wide as she did a demon head far better than her father had ever produced. Mrs. Hitachi then seemed to deflate and resumed her normal sugar high state.</p><p>"Good dear then just give Auntie one last hug goodbye." In which she then proceeded to squeeze the life out of Nabiki. This caused Nabiki to wonder if all rich people were this strange. That and wonder if Dr. Tofu would be available to do a back job for her today.</p><p>While Nabiki was getting the life squeezed out of her by an over zealous woman, Genma Saotome was getting the life kicked out of him by his erstwhile son turned daughter.</p><p>"Why did you even bring me here old man? Do you know how humiliated I have felt over the last couple of days? Because of you I have been subjected to loss after loss from Morisoto Kenchi and his bitch."</p><p>"It's not my fault boy if you can't be man enough to defeat the punk. You should have had him on that first fight but you were too much of a girl to defeat him. Oh why did I ever save you from that retched family I will never know? They have already turned you to much into a girl by the time I got to you."</p><p>"Shut up old man! You were the one that took me! You said you would make me into a real man not what my mother and sisters were turning me into. However all I have been getting lately is grief from you and it is making me sick! I would have been better off been raised as a girl than what you put me through."</p><p>"So you want to be a girl then boy. That can be arranged you know. You can just take some cold water like in this pail here and we can turn you into a girl right now."</p><p>Ranma quickly dodged the thrown water and continued to beat on his father something fierce. Of coarse this is the scene that Akane and an now annoyed and female Kenchi walked in on while they were taking a nice little walk in the park.</p><p>"You know you should watch where you throw cold water about." Kenchi said stopping the battle between father and son.</p><p>"Oh if it isn't the bitch and the friend of the bitch. What do we owe the pleasure of this visit? Finally give up on that idiot and come for a real man?"</p><p>Akane really didn't need to hear that at the moment with what was happening at home. Of coarse with Ranma in front of her she could relieve some stress. A good pervert beating is just what she needed. Yes, that is just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>Ranma got an uneasy feeling in his stomach at seeing Akane's smile. It was the sort of smile he would see his father make when he was about to fleece a chump and get away scot free. The type of smile a shark would make at his prey at he bore down on it.</p><p>"Linchi, would you mind stepping to the side. Ranma and I need to have a bit of a discussion."</p><p>"Are you sure you want to do that Akane? I know what type of mood you are in right now."</p><p>"What is the bitch in to much a state to fight properly or something? You afraid she might get hurt by fighting a man like me? I don't blame you of coarse I would really like to take something out of her."</p><p>"Actually I was worried she would put you into a pine box. I don't want my brother's fiancé to go to prison because she killed a pervert."</p><p>"YOUR BROTHER?"</p><p>"Yes my brother Kenchi, he would be most disappointed if Akane were to get into trouble by killing you. It would make things ever so difficult to marry her in prison. Of coarse Auntie would be really mad as well and that would be murder."</p><p>"Don't worry Linchi I won't kill the pervert just make him hurt real bad. I can do that can't I?" She asked giving Linchi a look that would make the most cynical of men melt, and then spend all their money on the woman in question.</p><p>"Hey, who am I to stop my brother's fiancé from beating the snot out of a pervert like Ranma. Just remember not to kill him is all."</p><p>Akane again turned towards Ranma that evil smile again appearing on her face. She took a step towards him when Genma stepped between them a smile on his own face.</p><p>"What do we get if my boy wins this match?"</p><p>Linchi and Akane looked at each other then at Genma in confusion. Still seeing the evil smile on his face gave her a chill up her spine.</p><p>"What do you mean what will you get?"</p><p>"Well this being a match and all what are the terms."</p><p>"I just know I get the satisfaction of beating the snot out of this pervert." Akane said now not paying attention to the smile as she should have.</p><p>Linchi on the other hand caught on to what the old fool was up to. She began to scowl heatedly at the man knowing what was coming next and in her anger Akane would fall for it hook line and sinker. Linchi knew Akane could take Ranma normally even though he would cheat Ranma would still lose as Akane would not give him time to pull off anything. It was Genma that was the problem. His interference would tip the balance in Ranma's favor. She knew he would make some type of move towards Akane during the match as he did in the match with her.</p><p>"Well then our condition if we should win is that you dissolve your engagement to that boy you are currently engaged to and marry Ranma."</p><p>"What! I will never marry that pervert!"</p><p>Linchi watched as a smile appeared on Ranma's face as he realized what his father was doing. He probably thought that a win against Akane was in the bag compared to fighting against Kenchi. What he didn't know is that in the weeks since his arrival Akane and her have been working on techniques to make sure that he would never be ably to subdue her. That and Akane was royally pissed off. Though it would be easier if she just didn't accept the terms, however by the smile on Genma's face, Linchi had a feeling that he would goad her into it. They really had to work on that temper of hers. It could really get her into trouble one of these days.</p><p>"Well then I guess you really don't want a fight then. It is just as well after all you are only a woman. You could never really keep up with a real martial artist. A small little thing like you should be working on tea ceremony and cooking. You should be working on something like flower arranging, not martial arts."</p><p>"That's it! You want a fight you got one. I agree to your terms old man. I will show you who's a martial artist."</p><p>Linchi sighed as she saw the trap that Akane was working herself into. However she could make sure that Genma stayed out of this fight as well. She would allow Akane to have her beat down on Ranma, she would not interfere with that but, she would be dammed before she let Genma get involved as well. Besides how could she marry Akane if she lost due to Genma's interference?</p><p>As the fight began Linchi made her way over towards the older man keeping an eye on him at all times. At first it looked like he would actually stay away from the fight. Then Akane started getting more and more hits on Ranma. It was recognized early that he was going for painful and disabilitating moves against Akane. They were recognized and countered swiftly. Akane's improvement in skill made her proud. When Akane made a hard punch to Ranma's gut sending him ten feet back on his knees coughing up his breakfast Genma tried to make his move.</p><p>Genma made to jump at Akane when he was tripped up at the last minute. He looked up at the red headed pony tailed girl with a scowl. "Stay out of this if you don't want to get hurt girl. You don't want to mess with an Anything Goes Martial Artist of my caliber."</p><p>"If you are the top of the line of the Anything Goes Martial Arts School then I have nothing to worry about. After all you are looking at one of the masters of the All or Nothing School of Martial Arts. We train to be the best the right way. There are no short cuts in out training. There is honor or no honor, my school also includes Amazon Wu Shu. I have defeated the musk king Herb master of ki. I have defeated masters from across the world. Do you really think you can stand up to me Genma Saotome of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts?"</p><p>With a growl Genma made a lunge at the erstwhile redhead and the fight was on.</p><p>Akane and Ranma traded blows back and forth. Ranma knew he was in trouble. Most of his tricks were countered already. He had tried blinding her with one of his powder pouches yet she had dodged that expertly. He had tried to take her out with a hit to her sensitive breasts yet she had countered that blow with a blow to his gut that was ten times the power of one of his punches. He ended up on his knees for a few seconds just trying not to vomit. He looked back at her scowling. She just stood there with a smirk waiting for him. After standing back up he lunged at her with a jump kick that would have taken her head off if it had connected. Yet she merely stepped out of the way of the kick and sent a side kick into the middle of his back. The blow sent tendrils of pain shooting up his spine. Again he found himself on the ground his legs refusing to move for a second.</p><p>"You bitch! You will pay for that!"</p><p>"Well then make me pay Ranma. So far all I see is you laying there on the ground bitching and wining about losing. Of coarse you are losing to a girl. I wonder what type of man that makes you?"</p><p>With an inhuman whale Ranma charged Akane. She was a bit surprised by the intensity of the charge. She took a blow to the shoulder that hurt but was able to shrug off the pain and snapped her knee into Ranma's gut causing him to gasp out a breath of pain. While Ranma was hunched over holding onto his abused gut, Akane did a spin kick hitting him on the boy's jaw sending him crashing into the far fence. She stalked over to the boy who was now sliding down from his impression in the fence.</p><p>"What now Ranma, is that all you have? Don't tell me we are done fighting already?"</p><p>Ranma knew he was beat. He could not figure out how to get past the girl's defenses. On top of that the girl hit like a pile driver. Even though he knew this he still got to his feet and started to taunt her through her family. It was the worst mistake he could make.</p><p>"You fucking bitch, you whore! I bet you sleep with every guy to come your way! I bet your mom was a whore just li..."</p><p>Ranma was unable to finish his sentence as with one hand Akane lifted him up by the collar of his shirt so tightly that it blocked his air supply.</p><p>"Never insult my mother jerk. Never even let the thought of her cross your small misbegotten brain. Do you understand me?"</p><p>Ranma through a punch at her menacing face, it was intercepted by her free hand. He began to struggle and scream in pain as she proceeded to crush every bone in his hand. He brought up his other hand to try and pry hers off his. She let go of him and proceeded to turn his face purple with bruises. He tried to kick out at her again, but she caught the kick as if it were nothing and then broke his shin in two places. Ranma cried out in pain again falling to the ground struggling to move away from the monster of a girl. She didn't let him get to far though as she again picked him up by the collar of his shirt and proceeded to give him one hell of a haymaker to his face. After which Ranma knew no more for the day.</p><p>Akane turned facing towards the spot where she had left her fiancée. Her face grew in shock at the fight proceeding in front of her. It was rare that she got to see a fight between masters. The fight before her left her in no doubt that it was two masters fighting. They seemed to dance between each other be it in the air or on the ground though as the fight continued it was clear who the better of the two were.</p><p>Linchi flinched as she took a hard hit to the thigh. She retaliated with a smart tattoo to the other mans back. The two separated each taking a small rest to reanalyze their opponent.</p><p>"Where did you learn Anything Goes girl?" Genma asked panting as he eyed the girl with suspicion.</p><p>"I have always known my stile of combat. You just made it easy for me to study yours while we fight. I must admit that your stile has a few good points to it. Though it also has many weaknesses to it as well. You flaunt what you learn. You underestimate your opponents not taking them seriously unless they prove to you straight out that they are the better. You are reckless and push society away from you as though they are of no use to you. That is your main weakness. Would you like for me to continue? You have many more that I can point out to you."</p><p>"Shut up girl! You know nothing of my art. We are the strongest. We will always be the most powerful of the martial artist because of our power. The great master himself could take you out with just a mere fleck of his pipe. I have only gone easy on you so far girl I suggest you give up now before I get nasty."</p><p>"Sigh, I have already seen all you can offer old man. Frankly you only impress me little as you have shown me a few new tricks. However that is all I see is tricks nothing that could really help you. Only get you in trouble with the populace."</p><p>"You wish to see power girl very well. Take this! DEMON ASSAULT BOMB! HEY LOOK OUT!" After shouting at her Genma proceeded to through vacuum blades at the redhead going for the easy win. It is sad he had to hurt her so bad but due to the insult of her family to his he had to teach the whelp a lesson. To his surprise the girl seemed to disappear from his sight and out of the path of the vacuum blades.</p><p>"Where did she learn the Umisen-ken?"</p><p>"So you want to bring in special techniques? Well Genma Saotome take this." At those words Linchi appeared in front of the older martial artist and proceeded to split herself in to multiple images circling him. "Can you tell which is the real me Genma Saotome? Behold the ancient Amazonian technique Splitting Cat Hairs!"</p><p>"You can't defeat me with such a simple trick girl! I am a master of Anything Goes Martial Arts. This is nothing! DEMON ASSAULT BOMB!"</p><p>Again Genma shot off vacuum blades to what he thought was the real girl. However, the blades just past through the image before him. This surprised Genma because he was sure that he felt her ki from that direction.</p><p>"Tut, tut, wrong one Genma. I think it is time to end this don't you. I really will have to be getting home soon after all." She then began to beat the stuffing out of Genma. It seemed to him that the hits were coming from every direction at once. The left, right, back, and front were all being hit over and over again. He felt pain in every hit over and over. From the tip of his head to the tip of his toes pain infused his body. The continuous pain kept up for about two minuets before Genma finally lost consciousness, falling to the ground in a heap with bruises covering every inch of his body.</p><p>"That Genma Saotome of the Anything Goes Martial Arts is how a master of the All or Nothing School of Martial Arts fights. Oh by the way thanks for showing something new here. It isn't often that I get to learn something more of the art. See you around then."</p><p>With that Linchi walked over to a smiling Akane, and the two walked away. Linchi had to admit that beating up on the Saotome's had been very soothing. Of coarse beating up punks who prey on the weak was always fun to her.</p><p>"So Akane when will your sister be leaving for school?"</p><p>"That is the question isn't it? She will need to leave soon because the new term starts in just a few days. I will have to ask her when I go home. I just hope father doesn't get to obstinate about it. This is Kasumi's big chance and she should take it. I kinda feel sorry for Dr. Tofu though. I know how much he liked her."</p><p>"The Dr. should have told her then. Kasumi is a grown woman and needs to make a life for herself. The Dr. can't expect her to wait forever can he?"</p><p>"No, he should have told her true, but he just can't seem to control himself around her. You have seen him; he goes absolutely nuts in her presence. Even a picture of her face will send him over the edge of sanity."</p><p>"If he really wanted her then he would get over that."</p><p>"There is also the dojo to consider in this too. If Kasumi gets married before me then the dojo would be endanger due to the inheritance laws. It is my dowry so if I don't get married first and get the tax reduced then we will not have the money to keep it. That is one thing that I don't want. I grew up in that place and do not want to lose it."</p><p>"Don't worry about that Akane. Even if Kasumi or Nabiki marry before you my family can handle that tax. You don't have to worry about losing your home."</p><p>"You know you are really sweet. I really wish you were in you Kenchi for right now so I could kiss you senseless."</p><p>"Akane! We're in public."</p><p>"So, that doesn't mean I want to kiss you any less." Akane smiled at the shocked girl by her side, and ran a ahead of her giggling.</p><p>A warm smile came to Linchi's face as she began to run after her erstwhile fiancé. The two then ran off laughing intending to enjoy the rest of their time together today.</p><p>Back at the Tendo dojo Kasumi was busy packing for her trip. Though calm on the outside she was in fact scared to death with doing this. It would be the first time she was away from home. Would her family really be able to take care of things when she was away? Would they really be alright with her gone? So many questions, yet she knew this was the right coarse of action. If she didn't go she would be branded as the little aloof housewife for all time. She had thought for a time that is what her mother was like yet thinking back her mother was never like that. She was nice and kind, yet she also knew what she wanted and took it. The dojo itself was as much her dream as it was fathers. It was her mother that had kept it to what would have been a great school before she died. Her mother had been the one to get the students in the door.<br/>Right now her father had squandered what he and mother had built. He was downstairs right now just sitting around doing practically nothing but letting his daughters run the house and dojo for him. They had needed him, and yet he had done nothing to help them. They barely made enough now to get by, and most of that was through the efforts of her and Nabiki through the name of their father. Now they would have to depend on themselves. She knew that her father would cause problems in the fact that he would still want a marriage between the Saotome family and theirs. It would be hell for her sisters in the time to come.</p><p>"So when are you planning on leaving sis?"</p><p>Kasumi turned to see Nabiki at her door, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed across her chest.</p><p>"My train leaves tomorrow afternoon. It will give you and Akane enough time to come home and see me off. I just hope I am doing the right thing."</p><p>Kasumi turned her face towards the floor, her eyes glassy as she thought of what she would be leaving behind. She felt a set of arms wrap around her then joined her sister by wrapping her own arms around her sister in a fierce hug.</p><p>"Don't worry Kasumi; know that you are doing the right thing. It is about time you got out and did something for yourself. School will be good for you. Don't worry we can take care of things around here. Don't let father dictate what you can and can't do. Hey I am sure we can even survive Akane's cooking for a while. I am sure she can't stay that bad a cook forever right?"</p><p>Kasumi smiled at her younger sister. She knew that Nabiki was right. She needed to get away and prove herself. Not only in the eyes of her family but, also in the eye's of the people around here and one blind idiotic doctor. With a smile Kasumi released her younger sister and looked into her eyes.</p><p>"Make sure to take good care of Akane Nabiki. I don't want to come home to the both of you in some sort of trouble."</p><p>"Well then that would be a waist of time Kasumi. When have you not known Akane to be in some sort of trouble that we had to not get her out from? Of coarse now she has that hunk of a fiancée to be with her. I am so jealous of her. How could she get someone so handsome and rich to fall for her?"</p><p>"Now Nabiki don't be like that I am sure you will find someone of your own. Like Akane there is someone out there that you will be able to bond with. How about that Kuno boy? I am sure he would like to go out with a smart girl like you."</p><p>"I am sorry sis, but I will never date Kuno in a million years. He is a delusional idiot that is hung up on Akane and Linchi. He bothers them as much as he can to get a date from them. No, Kuno is defiantly not the boy for me."</p><p>"Well like I said there is someone out there for you Nabiki."</p><p>"If he is out there he is not in Furinkan that is for sure. Oh well there is always collage to look forward to. I only have two more years to go before I go. I am slightly envious of you sis. You get to go and do something I have always wanted. I can't wait until it is my turn."</p><p>"Don't try to grow up to fast Nabiki. You should enjoy your childhood."</p><p>"Kasumi, the only one in the family that could really act a bit childish was Akane. With you leaving that will have to change as well. We can't afford to be children Kasumi. Mother's death and father's behavior sealed that for us. Now the only one that will probably act childish at all is father. Though Akane and I will give him a bit of a swift kick in the butt to get him to grow up if we can."</p><p>"I am sure you will little sister. Just don't be too rough with him. He is a very sensitive man after all."</p><p>"Kasumi, he is supposed to be the head of the family yet he acts like he is a little boy dependant on his parents still. He should be out working. He should be taking care of us as we take care of him. He should not be sitting around doing nothing but dream about having a great dojo. That will not come unless he works for it, and he is not working for it at all. You know that as much as I do. It is like Kenchi said before, you can have a dojo and do martial arts but that should not be your only occupation. He was right about that sis. Just like you need to get out of this place and learn how to operate outside of this house, he needs to do the same. It's a harsh world out there and if he doesn't get his act together he will find that he will lose everything he ever dreamed of."</p><p>"I know what you are saying Nabiki, it's just that with the loss of mother he has never been the same. He has been grieving, and I understand that he needs to grieve."</p><p>"Kasumi, it has been eleven years since mom died. He had his time to grieve but he should have taken care of us as well. He also should never have used moms memory to get what he wants by saying that mom would disapprove of a prospective love interest like he did to Akane a bit ago."</p><p>"He did what!"</p><p>"You heard me. He told Akane that mother would not approve of her love interest and that she was acting like a tart. All she did was give him a kiss on the cheek, and he blew up at her. She was giving her fiancé support and he tries to make it seem that was wrong while bringing mother into it."<br/>"I see, I guess he does need to learn that he can't get things to go his own way at times. There will be people out there that will not stand for his behavior. If he angers the wrong person he could get into serious trouble."</p><p>"He almost did that with Akane's new fiancé earlier. He almost insulted his family. That would have been his last mistake as they could buy this property right out from under us and force us out without a whim. The Hitachi's are not a family to be trifled with."</p><p>"Did you say Hitachi, as in the Hitachi financial group?"</p><p>"That is exactly who I said."</p><p>"Oh my, and they are also the ones that are giving me my scholarship for school."</p><p>Nabiki was about to respond to that when an eager "I'm Home!" came from the front door. Nabiki went to the door and called down to her younger sister.</p><p>"We're up here sis in Kasumi's room. Could you come up here for a bit there is something's we need to discuss with you."</p><p>Soon enough Akane came into the room a bright smile on her face. Her smile kind of lost some of its vigor as she spied the solemn looks of her sisters.</p><p>"What's up? Why the glum faces?"</p><p>"We were just discussing the changes that have been going on around here. Your engagement, Kasumi going off to collage, with a scholarship from your fiancé's company no less, and daddy's behavior in the last few weeks have been a couple of our discussion topics. I see that you have gotten more chipper since you left."</p><p>"Oh Nabiki you should have been there. Linchi showed up after Kenchi had to leave and we ran into that pervert Ranma and his father. We then proceeded to beat the snot out of them. Linchi actually let me take Ranma by myself. She of coarse dealt with his father, but it was fantastic."</p><p>"Oh was it? What were you fighting over if I may ask?"</p><p>"Well I just wanted something to hit, but they made a condition that I would have to give up my engagement to Kenchi if I lost and become Ranma's fiancée again."</p><p>"Akane! What were you thinking?"</p><p>"I won though Kasumi"</p><p>"It doesn't matter Akane. What you did was dangerous. Kasumi is right to be shocked. What if Linchi had not been there? You saw how Ranma and Genma cheated in their fight against your fiancé. Do you think you could possibly stand up to both of them if you were there alone?"</p><p>"I wasn't though."</p><p>"What if you were? Akane you must understand that the Saotome's don't work on the honor system the same as you would. They cheat to get what they want. You are just lucky that your fiancé's sister is just as good a martial artist as her brother. Did she actually challenge Mr. Saotome or was she just guarding your back while you took on Ranma?"</p><p>"I guess she was guarding my back."</p><p>"You need to understand Akane that if she was not there you would have lost, and right now we would be in the same situation that your fiancé got us out of."</p><p>"He said I wasn't a martial artist though and I was just a weak little girl. I couldn't let that stand."</p><p>"Akane, he was just goading you into a fight. Of coarse Ranma would..."</p><p>"Actually it was Mr. Saotome that said that."</p><p>"Even better, was it him that made the terms of getting you married to Ranma?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Akane, do you want to be married to Ranma?"</p><p>"No, of coarse not Kasumi, I would rather kill myself than be married to a pervert like him."</p><p>"Then learn to think before you act little sister. One of these times he will get you alone and they will try to goad you into a fight again. This time however, Kenchi or Linchi will not be there to help you when you need it. Then you will be stuck in a loveless marriage with a creep that will rape you every night and probably take advantage of others while he is at it. You and Nabiki will be on your own here with only father. I know father will not care if Ranma somehow takes advantage of you. Father's main hope right now is for one of us to get pregnant with Ranma's child for an heir to the dojo. It seems he can't get that out of his head."</p><p>"Sis is right, you really need to be careful and control that temper of yours little sister. One day that temper will really get you in trouble. You have a lot right now. Do you really want to risk losing it because you got angry at someone for saying you aren't a martial artist? We all know you are one. If you are challenged or challenge someone else you need to make sure there are other's around. That is one the reasons I like to get a crowd to see your fights. That way there are plenty of witnesses to see what happened in the fight. That way no one can say something else happened."</p><p>"I thought you just liked doing that so you get the most profit you could."</p><p>"That too, but that's beside the point."</p><p>"She is right Akane. You still need to be careful out there. If you go and try to hit the wrong person one day it could mean more trouble than it is worth. You should never hit someone in anger. Is that what a true martial artist would do?"</p><p>"No Kasumi, a true martial artist wouldn't ever strike someone in anger."</p><p>Akane looked down at the floor a pout coming to her face. Both Kasumi and Nabiki came over and gave their younger sister a hug.</p><p>"We are just trying to look out for you Akane. You have so much, and we would hate for you to lose it because you got angry and went overboard one day. Kasumi is not going to be here to help us and in a couple years you will be on your own. It will be up to you to keep this place up. That will mean you need to know when to deal with things not with your fists, but with your head instead. I will be here to help for the next two years but you will need to figure things out for yourself here soon.</p><p>"I know sis. I guess I do have to learn to control my temper like Linchi said."</p><p>"Smart girl, I see she already had a bit of a discussion with you on this?"</p><p>"Yes, she didn't put it so bluntly though Nabiki."</p><p>"Well that is me you know. I come with things straight out. Unless there is a way I can get paid for the information of course."</p><p>"Nabiki!"</p><p>Nabiki looked back and forth between her older and younger sisters who were giving her dark looks after both yelling her name. "What? A girl needs to make some cash somehow right?"</p><p>Her smile returning Akane turned to her eldest sister. "So Kasumi, are you nervous about leaving? When are you going to be going anyway?"</p><p>"My train will leave tomorrow afternoon. It will be enough time for both you and Nabiki to get home from school to see me away."</p><p>"Well while you finish packing then I will go ahead and cook dinner!"</p><p>"Actually Akane I was planning to take Kasumi out tonight to celebrate her going to collage and all."</p><p>"Hmmm, that isn't such as bad idea Nabiki. I guess while you two are out I can make something for daddy though. I know he wouldn't want to celebrate with you. Now what can I make for us?"</p><p>Nabiki watched her little sister walk out of her sisters room almost skipping in anticipation of cooking a feast for tonight that she knew her father would love."</p><p>"You know Kasumi; there is no payment in the world I would except to be daddy right now. I just hope he survives. We need him still for all the paperwork on this place."</p><p>"Oh my, I just hope my kitchen will survive. Oh, my poor, poor kitchen, what ever will happen to it?"</p><p>Nabiki smirked at her elder sister and replied. "You need to remember sis. It is no longer your kitchen. You need to let it go. After all you will have your own kitchen soon enough. Now let's get out of hear before we somehow get shanghaied by father to stay and eat Akane's cooking."</p><p>"Oh my yes let's get going."</p><p>So the two Tendo sisters took off leaving their father to a fate he so rightly deserved. It was a night full of pain and suffering of the stomach, in which no antacid could remedy.</p><p>The next day we find Akane and Nabiki walking together to school with Nabiki giggling at the antics of her temperamental sister. "Oh come on Akane don't be so mad. You know daddy was just in a bad mood this morning."</p><p>"That didn't give him the right to call my cooking the embodiment of Satan himself. I mean I know I am not the best of cooks but I am trying."</p><p>"I know you are sis, but you need to learn to also taste your own cooking before you serve it to others. If you don't like it how do you expect others to like it."</p><p>"Now I have been trying to tell her that for a while."</p><p>The two sisters looked up to the fence by their side and saw Kenchi there smiling down at them.</p><p>"So if isn't the boy wonder himself, come to see your fiancée have you?"</p><p>"Why of course Nabiki. Why wouldn't I come to see my beautiful wife to be?"</p><p>With a blush on her face Akane turned to her fiancé giving him her ten thousand megawatt smile.</p><p>"Kenchi, stop embarrassing me!"</p><p>"I'm sorry Akane; I just love to see that smile on your face though."</p><p>He then proceeded to jump down from the fence and stepped between the two girls putting an arm around Akane in the process.</p><p>"Well ladies shall we get to school?"</p><p>"Showoff." Akane whispered with a smile at her fiancé.</p><p>"I know, I know I shouldn't be such a showboat but I just can't help it. I just feel so happy today."</p><p>"Oh, and what makes you so happy today?" Nabiki asked looking over to her sister's fiancé.</p><p>"Well, it just seems like just a nice day. What isn't there to be happy about? The sun is out, I have my fiancée by my side, I am going to not have to deal with Ranma today, and I found out that my aunt totally approves of Akane. It is just a great day!"</p><p>"Your aunt approves of me?"</p><p>"Yes, isn't it great? Of course she did go on and on about grandnieces and nephews last night for some reason."</p><p>Akane blushed to the roots of her hair when Kenchi mentioned that. She couldn't get the dirty little thoughts out of her head of what they would need to do to make those Grandnieces and Nephews.</p><p>"Well sorry to burst your happy moment, but we had better hurry or we will be late for school. I don't think it would be good for us to be late and standing in the hall all day would it?"</p><p>"Your right Nabiki of course, come on you two, let's get to school then."</p><p>"Right behind you darling."</p><p>"Oh please, don't make me sick."</p><p>With that the three ran off for school. They ran through the gates, running over Kuno in the process before he could even get a word in, and proceeded into class for the day. At lunch the three met up again and sat together under the tree that Akane and Kenchi would usually sit under on warm days.</p><p>"So why are you sitting with us today sis?"</p><p>"Because Akane I want to keep an eye on you so you don't go off and embarrass yourself today. I know how pumped up you are today."</p><p>"Nabiki!"</p><p>"What, am I wrong?"</p><p>"NABIKI!"</p><p>"Ok, ok, I was just joking sis. I just wanted to sit with you today that's all. Is that a crime?"</p><p>"No I guess not, it's just that you usually are out doing your business at this time."</p><p>"I don't need to worry about that today. All my subordinates are taking care of things for me. So I get to just be here with my sister and her fiancé to talk. Also to find out if your fiancé has any other single male relatives I can get involved with."</p><p>"NABIKI!"</p><p>"I know my name Akane you don't have to shout it."</p><p>"I see you have irrigated yourself well with the girls around here sonny boy." Spoke a voice that seemed to come from all around.</p><p>"It is about time you said something Old Mummy I thought you were just going to sit up there all day."</p><p>There was a sudden WHACK and then Akane and Nabiki saw a three foot old woman appear in front of them with a stick imbedded in Kenchi's head.</p><p>"Who are you calling an Old Mummy sonny boy?"</p><p>"Why you old mummy." Kenchi said with a smile looking at the old woman while ignoring the stick on his noggin.</p><p>"Still as obstinate as ever I see." She replied removing the stick from his head.</p><p>"You wouldn't love me any other way and you know it."</p><p>"Um, Kenchi, who is this?"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry Akane. Akane, Nabiki, this is Cologne leader of the Chinese Amazons, holder of ancient martial lore, and my I don't know how many greats grandmother. Cologne, this is my fiancée Akane Tendou and her sister Nabiki."</p><p>Cologne looked over at the two girls appraising them then looked back at Kenchi. "So you have a girl do you? I thought you were never going to get married sonny boy."</p><p>"What can I say I fell in love. So, why are you here granny? I am sure you are not here to visit your favorite student."</p><p>"Sadly you are right. I am here searching for Shampoo."</p><p>"Shampoo, what is she doing here in Japan?"</p><p>Akane, Nabiki, and Cologne could all see the worry that came to Kenchi's face at the mention of the name.</p><p>"She was in the tournament this year as you know. She actually won even. Then something unfortunate happened. There was this girl and her panda eating the first prize that should have belonged to her. She wound up challenging the girl to combat and lost most grievously. The girl used a dishonorable tactic throwing some powder into Shampoo's eyes. The girl won of course but made Shampoo pay a serious price. Shampoo was blinded permanently. We found out shortly after that the girl was a boy cursed at jusenkyou. Shampoo didn't want to marry someone who would act so dishonorably though in her weakened state he was almost able to force himself on her. I was able to stop him and drive him and his father off. Shampoo however did not take the humiliation well and left. She is trying to hunt down the boy to kill him as a normal warrior would do. Yet she does not have the skill yet in her state to stand a chance against him. I am afraid for her life if she should run into him again. The last we heard he was coming here to Japan."</p><p>"Raaaannnnmmmmaaaaa!" Kenchi growled fiercely looking down at the ground in furry.</p><p>"You know of the boy?" Cologne asked looking between the three teenagers.</p><p>"Yes," Nabiki answered while Akane put her arms around her distraught fiancé. "His father and ours wanted to set up an engagement between out families. Kenchi helped us out of it by defeating him in a match of honor for the hand of Akane. Kenchi of course won. Ranma had even used the same powder that I believe he used on this Shampoo of yours."</p><p>"Where is the boy now?" Cologne growled her knuckles turning white as she clenched them into fists."</p><p>"You could try the nearest hospital. I broke a couple of his bones yesterday when we had a mach of our own." Akane answered as she looked to the old woman.</p><p>"Very well I..."</p><p>"No wait Cologne, don't do anything to Ranma. That is Shampoo's right not yours."</p><p>"Kenchi, Shampoo is in no condition to fight Ranma, not in her condition."</p><p>"She will be after I get through training her. As well with your help elder we can make her strong enough to battle someone as dishonorable as that bastard Ranma and his father. She deserves the right to at least try to get her honor back for what he did to her."</p><p>"Very well Kenchi, but know that Shampoo and I are not the only ones looking for him from the tribe. Mouse is also on the rampage even though Shampoo wants nothing to do with him."</p><p>"He is still giving Shampoo problems?"</p><p>"Unfortunately, yes he is, and he is also out for your blood as well sonny boy."</p><p>"He has always been a thorn in my side granny. I can handle him. I am more worried about Shampoo right now. I just hope I can hold back against Ranma the next time I see him for her."</p><p>"You and I both, sonny boy, well then I will be in town then so you will know how to find me. If you see Shampoo before I do let me know please."</p><p>"I will granny, you can bet on it."</p><p>"With a bow to both Akane and Nabiki, Cologne hopped up on her stick and proceeded to hop over the school wall and out of sight."</p><p>"So that was the old ghoul you've been telling me about Kenchi?"</p><p>"Yeah, she is a bit eccentric but I love her anyway."</p><p>"Come on Akane we had better get back to class lunch is almost over."</p><p>"Yeah, to bad we didn't get to eat much of it."</p><p>"I know what you mean Nabiki."</p><p>With that said that three proceeded back into the school and separated for their classes.</p><p>After school we find the Tendo sisters as well as their father and Kenchi at the train station. Soun of course was wailing like a baby holding on to Kasumi with all his might.</p><p>"I forbid for you to leave me Kasumi. I forbid it! You can't leave, you just can't! I am your father and I forbid..."</p><p>He was unable to say any more as a mallet came crashing down upon his head sending him into unconsciousness.</p><p>"Don't mind daddy big sister. I will miss you though." Akane said making her mallet disappear and wrapping her arms around her eldest sister in a big hug.</p><p>"I will miss you as well little sister." Kasumi answered releasing her younger sister.</p><p>"Don't forget about us out there Kasumi. Write to us often if you can."</p><p>"I will Nabiki don't worry about that. I will write once I get settled in ok?"</p><p>"We will be expecting the letter."</p><p>Kasumi pulled the middle Tendou sister into a hug of her own. "You take care of things for me Nabiki ok. Don't let things get too out of control while I am gone."</p><p>"I won't sis you know that."</p><p>"I know, I know."</p><p>Kasumi then turned towards Kenchi a smile on her face.</p><p>"Look after my sisters for me. I will be counting on you."</p><p>He smiled at the elder sister saying, "I will, I will make sure that they are well taken care of don't worry."</p><p>"Good, because if I find out anything has happened to them I will make you pay somehow."</p><p>"I am sure you would not be the only one."</p><p>He laughed at all the people that would be on his case if he let anything happen to Nabiki and Akane especially. Not to mention his own torment at letting something happen to his new family.</p><p>"Well sis it is time for you to go." Nabiki said handing over Kasumi's carryon pack.</p><p>Kasumi took the pack from her sister and then stepped over her father and through the doors of the train. With one last look back at her family she boarded the train and prepared for her new life. A life that was now as uncertain as her feelings for a certain doctor. She had a new life now, one she would take full advantage of. The housewife was gone. When she returned she would be Kasumi that doctor.</p><p>On the steps of a clinic in Nerima a young doctor with glasses felt a chill go up his spine as though he was losing something important in his life that he may never get back He walked out onto the sidewalk looking out over the horizon thinking about the love of his live. He also thought of why he couldn't control himself around her. With a sigh he turned to go back into the clinic when someone bumped into him."</p><p>"Oh excuse me." He said grabbing onto the person before they fell.</p><p>"Excuse Shampoo, is Shampoo fault not feel there in front of."</p><p>The young doctor looked down and saw a young girl with long purplish, blue hair done up in Odangos. She wore an outfit that did not match though the blouse and pantsuit did complement her figure well. He also saw that she wore extremely dark glasses over her eyes.</p><p>"It might help you to see well if you took those dark glasses off."</p><p>The girl frowned at the doctor's comment replying, "Shampoo no can see. Shampoo eyes no work. Shampoo must wear dark glasses to protect damaged eyes."</p><p>"Oh I am so sorry. How thoughtless of me. Here come in to my clinic and let me have a look. I am a doctor. Let me see what I can do."</p><p>The girl turned her head in an inquiring way facing the doctor yet not looking towards him just facing him with her head cocked.</p><p>"Aiya, why not, Shampoo has nothing better to do at moment."</p><p>"Good, I also have two other patients at the moment so let me just check on them while you sit down and I will be right back."</p><p>"Aiya, Shampoo wait, doctor go check on patient then."</p><p>"Good then I will be right back."</p><p>The doctor then walked back into his clinic to check on the two martial artists he had in his recovery room. Never knowing the danger his simple clinic was in. The poor, poor fool.</p><p>Author's Notes...</p><p>Wow two chapters in one year who would have thought. Ok to answer some of your questions out there. Yes the fake Ranma is a cannon character. He doesn't act like he usually would because of Genma's influence. As far as people asking me when I will bring Nodoka in to this and when the real Ranma will learn of who he really is and get his memories back. That will not happen for some time. My own brother asked about that I and I will tell you what I told him. In the case with Akane losing her memories of Ranma in the anime she had only lost them for a short time when she got them back because Ranma was there to bring them back. Kenchi (The Real Ranma) has been without the memories of his father and mother for years. All he will get back is a vague recollection of what he lost. There are only a few memories I plan on him remembering but that will happen sometime down the line. Nodoka will be a part of this story. After all Misaki needs someone to go off on after all. However she will not just come out and say that Kenchi is Ranma like some people think she will. After all she thought Ryu was Ranma for a time. She will be faced with the shock of Kenchi saying she is his mother though. He is searching for her after all. Will Genma's deception be unraveled? Hell yes! Well as for next chapter (When I actually get it done) Shampoo finds out whom Dr. Tofu's patients are (Cry havoc the dogs of war). Kenchi find's Shampoo. Also Kenchi gets kissed by a guy? (Dead man walking.) Be here next time for Conflicts.</p>
