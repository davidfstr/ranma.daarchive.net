</div>        What's In a Name<p>Ok just to let you know these characters are not mine. They belong to the wonderful lady who created them. They are also distributed by VIZ Video. I am not nor will not gain any money by writing this story. This story is just being written for fun that is all.</p><b><p style="text-align:center;">What's In a Name</p><p style="text-align:center;">By</p><p style="text-align:center;">The Catman</p><p style="text-align:center;">Prolog</p><p style="text-align:center;"></p></b>The old woman was startled by a sound behind her. She scanned the area around her looking everywhere but finding nothing. She let her senses extend beyond her body. What she found amazed and frightened her. She did not show any signs of her fright though for she knew that would be very dangerous. Instead she continued with her chores as she had always done before. Thoughts ran through her head at what she had felt. Very disturbing thoughts.<p>(If I find the fool that has done this I'll…I'll what?) She thought with sadness. (I cannot interfere with a teenage boy's instruction. They are very stubborn; the boy probably wanted to know how to do the technique. Probably to become the best in the art as others have wanted to. Who could resist the lure of an indestructible technique?) She sighed at the stupidity of it. Why a boy could not understand why a technique was band she could not understand. After all that was how she lost her son and husband.</p><p>She had walked in too late. Her son had already embraced the madness and had torn her husband's internals out. Her husband had been a physical man. He had known the art and known it well. He had made a mistake though and left an old training manual out where her son and his friend could find it. The friend was nowhere to be seen. Her husband had tried without success to subdue their son. That had been his last and final mistake. The boy had become instantly territorial. Having another male around at the instant of his release from the pit of cats was a disaster. When she had finally calmed her son down he still would not come out of the madness.</p><p>He had started searching for a mate. The authorities would have taken him if he had raped the girl down the road. The girl was to marry another man to bring together two powerful martial art schools. Her son had had feelings for the girl. He had never had the power to defeat the other boy to gain the love of the girl from the other boy though.</p><p>She knew it would not matter if he did. The girl was in love with the dishonorable boy. There was nothing her son could do to turn her favor. She knew that love was blind. Her son just never accepted that fact and would not give up. That is probably the reason he had tried to learn the catfist technique she assumed. He had killed her husband and lost all hope of recovery at that time. Trying to get to the girl was just the icing on the cake. It was fortunate that the girl was not in the area at the time. She had to take matters into her own hands at the time and had to appeal to the catfist one weakness. It could only work after the victim had initially turned to the cat personality of the catfist madness. When the victim was in his cat mode for the first time the body would still not be in the proper shape to handle the excess chi generated from the technique. She had known a way to boost the level of a person's chi to the point where the power would knock the person out. However if she used the technique on a victim of the catfist at the stage of development that her son was in it would cause his heart to explode. It would only work in the few short hours after the initial madness had taken the victim. She had used the technique before her son had left the girl's house. He had been dead within minutes of the application of the technique. She was lucky, for her son had trusted her and allowed her to come close enough to use the chi charge technique. If she had been unable to stop him there may have been an unstoppable killing machine let lose on the district. Then she would have to deal with the authorities as well. She regretted what she had to do, but it had to be done. She knew that, but it still hurt.</p><p>After she had taken care of her son she had taken him to be buried along with her husband. She was glad that she had friends to help. As soon as the two were taken away she set to clean her home as best she could before her daughter returned from school. It was hard to clean all the blood and gore away in the few short hours that she had. That was simple though than telling her only remaining child what had happened to her father and brother. They had mourned a long time after the deaths. It was always painful to lose those you love. For herself a loving husband and a son. For her daughter a caring father and a brother.</p><p>She had gone searching for the missing friend and had found him in the park huddled up in a fetal position a look of fright on his face. She had calmed him down and asked how they had gained the knowledge of the catfist. That was how she learned of the manual. Unfortunately he had lost it during his flight from the house. She had searched long and hard for that book in the days after her husband and son's death. It had disappeared though and could not be found. That made her days of mourning even sadder for if some fool were to go through with the training what could happen may be disastrous. And this time she would not be able to help. For with her son she had his trust. This time she had no such bond.</p><p>The old woman was brought out of her thoughts by a nudging on her leg. She looked down and was shocked at what she saw. She had expected a teenage boy to be the one under the madness of the catfist training. She did not expect a six to seven year old boy. Anger grew in her heart as she looked to the boy. Anger at the person who could have done this vile thing to one so young. The boy started to back away from her as her rage began to show. She quickly submerged it. It would not help the boy if she got mad. She needed to stay calm. To stay in control of her emotions. She started to radiate calmness around her. The boy looked at her then began to come closer to her again. Sadness also found its way into her heart as she thought of what would become of the boy. She knew she would have to kill him before he started to act like her son. First though she would have to get his trust.</p><p>It amazed her just how powerful this boy was. Not only had she mistaken the boy for a teenager because of the training requirements called upon to access the deadly technique. This young boy should not even be alive at the moment. The amount of chi he was generating should have already have made his heart explode. Just how much power could this boy take? If he was this powerful now in the frenzy of the catfist training madness, how powerful would the boy become if he were to complete the full training of the catfist.</p><p>(No!) She thought suddenly. (It would be a mistake to let the boy have access to such power.) She studied the boy as he sat on his haunches watching her. His dark braided hare matted with claw marks surrounding his skin. Yet they were healing before her eyes. This amazed her even more. If the boy could heal himself at such a fast rate he could be unbeatable even without the catfist to assist him.</p><p>She looked into the blank yet caring playful gray blue eyes of the young boy. She sighed as she realized that she would not be able to kill the child. Even in her son she had seen the true madness in his eyes. This boy did not have that madness. Where her son's eyes were filled with hate and spite and the uncaring feelings of a grown mail tomcat. This boy's eyes were filled with the love and innocence of a kitten. No she could not kill him. The question then arose on what to do with him then. She supposed she could sit and watch the boy until whoever had done this to him would come looking for him. She almost did that until the thought entered her mind that it would be best if she took the boy inside. There she could watch from her window for any strangers to come by looking for the boy. It also wouldn't due to shock the person right off the bat that they would now have a cat for a student or a son if that were the case.</p><p>She slowly stepped back from the boy. Waving and cooing for him to follow her. He looked at her his head tilted to the side. He then rose onto all fours and proceeded to follow her. He slowly followed her until he reached the doorway to her house. There he stopped. Cautiously he looked through the doorway. Not responding to her cooing sounds any longer.</p><p>She knew that it would be better for the boy if he was inside instead of out there where others could see. (It may bring embarrassment on the boy's family if they saw him like this.) She reasoned to herself. An idea came to her then. She quickly got some milk and cakes from the kitchen hoping that the boy would still be there when she returned. Thankfully he was still looking through the doorway as she cautiously moved towards him.</p><p>"Look here young one." She said putting the bowl of milk on the floor while still holding the cakes in her other hand. The boy watched her as she backed away from the bowl. He again came closer through the door and up to the bowl of milk. He began sniffing the bowl rim and then the milk itself. He then took a cautious lick then another. Soon the boy was hungrily lapping up the milk in the bowl.</p><p>The old woman slowly stood while the boy was drinking. She made her way around him and closed the door behind her. At all times keeping her eye on the small boy. She again moved around the boy and sat as he finished drinking.</p><p>The boy looked up from the bowl of milk. A contented look on his face. He slowly advanced on the old woman getting closer every few minuets. Eventually the boy made his way up to her. The boy began to sniff at her then nudging her with his head. She still remained as still as she could not making any aggressive movements. The boy then backed away from her meowing. Suddenly he lunged at her startling her. She closed her eyes cursing her unwillingness to kill the boy. Suddenly she heard purring. The old woman had a startled look on her face when she opened her eyes and found the boy on her lap. She smiled and soon started to giggle at the playfulness of this young boy. The sneaky little guy had nearly given her a heart attack.</p><p>What happened next gave her an even greater shock. The boy started to uncurl from her lap. His head still nestled within the soft folds of her kimono. He also began to speak instead of the soft purring of a sleeping kitten.</p><p>"No pop…stop…pleases…it…hurts. Please pop not the pit again. Yes…I…want to be a man for mother. Yes I know I must be a man, but the cats frighten me. No I am not a coward. Yes I will be a man. I wont be frightened any more, just please don't throw me ba…ck…"</p><p>His words brought a tear to the old woman's eyes. To think that a father would put his son through such an ordeal. She smiled down at the boy. He was simply amazing. She had never before seen one come all the way back from the catfist training madness. But this young boy had done what many masters of the art could not. He had brought himself back from the madness. Given the proper care he could well become a true master of the catfist. And without the madness to lead him to hurt others as he would, it might be a blessing.</p><p>It would take time to heal the mental scaring the boy had suffered, but it could be done. (The school of her family could live again through this boy.) She thought as she gazed adoringly at him. Her daughter would love to have him she knew. After all after her first child was born complications made her sterile. Then the death of her daughter's son two years ago sent both her daughter and her daughter's husband into seclusion to mourn.</p><p>The old woman sighed at the thought of yet another tragedy that had happened in her family. The poor young boy was the hope of the school. But he had been born with a weak constitution. The boy had contracted pneumonia when he turned four. Already being weak the boy had died three days later. The two had left soon after their young son's death. Making their way to the woods to live in seclusion. They had even kept their sons death a secret. In fact she had received a letter from them recently for her to come visit. She had considered it too, but chores around the house just would not wait. Looking down upon the sleeping boy she was glad she had not.</p><p>The boy with his head still in her lap began to stir from his restless slumber. His eyes opened, and he blinked a couple times while his mind cleared the fog in his brain. He looked up facing the old woman. Then realization came to him of what he was laying on and he quickly sat up pushing himself away from her.</p><p>"Wh…wh…where am I?" He said weakly. Shaking his head in confusion. He stood up and stumbled about reaching out to balance himself on a wall.</p><p>The old woman quickly got up and steadied him to keep the boy from falling. "You should be careful young one. You had quite an ordeal. Come sit for a bit until you regain your equilibrium."</p><p>"My what?"</p><p>"Your balance."</p><p>"Oh," he said while she led him to a place to sit. She then went back to the hall and got the plate of cakes she had set down earlier. When she entered the room where she had put the boy he was again starting to stand up.</p><p>"It would be better if you stayed seated for a bit young one." She said as she set the plate of cakes down on the table.</p><p>"But I need to get back to my pop." He said shaking his head. "I need to find him so he can train me to be the man mother wants me to be."</p><p>"I am sure that he can wait while you have something to eat first young one."</p><p>"Eat! Yeah sure he can wait for that!" The boy said excitedly.</p><p>"Good then you just sit there and eat and we can talk about your father's training. After all I can see that it has done wonders for you so far."</p><p>"Well he has taught me a lot of really neat stuff. I can show you if you would like?"</p><p>"Go right ahead young one. Go right ahead."</p><p>The boy got to his feet more steadily than before and started a kata that his father had shown him. The old woman watched as the boy flawlessly went through the complex kata. He was just showing her surprise after surprise. In that instant she knew she could not return the boy to his father. Her daughter and herself could raise the boy better at any rate. She could even get the help of her amazon Aunt in China Ku-Lon. After all she knew many more aspects of the art being nearly two hundred years older than herself.</p><p>The Question then arose on how to keep the boy with her. The boy would undoubtedly want to return to his rightful guardian. The innocent boy just did not know how bad the man was to him. He was just to young to understand such things. So how was she going to keep him from going back? As he continued his kata a plan formed in the mind of the old woman.</p><p>"Young one would you mind if I showed you something?"</p><p>The boy stopped his kata and looked skeptically at the old woman.</p><p>"You can show me something?"</p><p>"Yes, it would probably really impress your father even."</p><p>"Really? Cool, show me!"</p><p>"All right just wait right there for a second OK?"</p><p>"Yes ma'am!" He said excitedly hopping up and down while clapping his hands. He couldn't wait to show his father a technique that he would be impressed at.</p><p>The old woman got up and walked out of the room. When she came back she was carrying a bottle of something called formula one one zero.</p><p>"Hey what's that for?" The boy asked.</p><p>"You will see soon enough. It is actually a critical part of the technique."</p><p>"Really? Wow!"</p><p>"Now watch closely to what I do."</p><p>The old woman became a blur of motion. When it was all over the boy had a blank look on his face. He stared at the old woman for a second then asked. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Why your grandmother young one don't you remember?"</p><p>"No, I don't. "What happened grandmother?" He looked around in confusion at his surroundings then again looked to the old woman. "Grandmother?"</p><p>"Yes young one."</p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p>"Oh my poor child. I guess I was to rough with you. You are my grandson Kenchi. The heir to the school of All or Nothing goes martial arts. You are the pride of the school my grandson. You will become the best of us all."</p><p>The boy looked to the old woman with recognition of those words. "Yes grandmother I am to be the best there is in the art right?"</p><p>"Yes my grandson." She said as she pulled the boy into a hug. Not noticing the man running past her house yelling for his lost son.</p><b><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 1</p><p style="text-align:center;">A Different Start</p></b><p style="text-align:center;">Akane got out of bed ready for the new day. Today was special for her. It was the first day of high school. She had been looking forward to this the whole summer. She was always a bit envious of how Nabiki would tell her of the things she did at high school. Soon She would be among those in the big kid's school. Not one of the little kids any more. And maybe now a certain doctor would start to notice her. She smiled at the thought of that.</p><p>Akane quickly made her way to the bathroom and stripped out of her night cloths. Filling a bucket with cold water she pours its contents over herself. Then lathered herself and repeated the process of pouring cold water over herself. Washing the lather from her body. She then entered the furo for a nice soak. She usually went for a run at this time but she was much to excited today to do that. She was wondering what the people at her new school would be like. She was sure she would find lots of friends. She was certain it would be better than her old school. There the boys were so immature. She always heard them talking about her behind her back. Yes she thought, her new school would be much better she was sure.</p><p>The table was already served for breakfast when Akane came down from her bath. She like her sister Nabiki was dressed in a Furincan girls uniform. Kasumi, Akane's other older sister was wearing one of her normal knee length skirts and a white blouse. She had on her everyday-cooking apron over her skirt. Her father in his normal brown gi was sitting reading the morning newspaper.</p><p>Akane quickly made her way to the table and served herself her breakfast. It was a quiet breakfast and Akane knew why. On the first day of school every year her father, if anything were said, would go into a fit about how old his little girls were getting. It was a hassle in itself when Kasumi had graduated high school. Akane always felt a little envious and a little sad for her older sister. She had given up much so Nabiki and herself could have a somewhat normal life. Akane didn't know of many friends that hung around Kasumi. It was like she was locked up inside this house never to escape.</p><p>Then there was the fact that Kasumi was very beautiful. She had unknowingly stolen the man of her dreams from right under her nose. Well OK so they weren't necessarily an item yet. That was the only chance she had though of winning his favor. After all no one was better than Dr. Tofu was.</p><p>Akane's mind then drifted over to Nabiki. She was the mercenary of the family. She was always so good with numbers. When their mother died it was Kasumi who kept the family together. But it was Nabiki who kept the family afloat. Nabiki as with Kasumi had given up a lot to achieve her status. She was known to all at her school as the ice queen of Furincan high school. And with the title came a certain separation from the rest of the school. Akane had seen Nabiki hang out with other girls, but they always seemed more like associates than real friends did.</p><p>As for herself? Well she loved martial arts. It was what she knew best. After the death of her mother her father took to training her for the future of the school as he had put it. Of coarse the fact that she kind of made him teach her wasn't a part of it. Above anything Akane wanted to make her father proud of her. So far she was the best martial artist in the neighborhood. And with the start at the new school she was determined to make her mark as the best there to.</p><p>"So Akane are you excited on starting out at a new school today?" Asked Kasumi in her innocently sweet voice.</p><p>"Oh yes." Akane replied back to her sister. "I can't wait to meet all the new people there."</p><p>"Don't get your hopes up to high sis. There's not that much to see at Furincan. It's just your normal everyday school with the occasional lunatic hanging around." (Reference Kuno)</p><p>"I'm sure it must be better than my old school Nabiki. After all everyone there was always talking of how exciting Furincan was. And of the great kendo team they have."</p><p>"True I always win well on Kunobaby's fights but still not much ells happens. It would be a great relief if someone could actually get the better of Kuno at one point. You don't know how hard it is to hear him always bragging about his ancient Japanese heritage. And that none can stand his might."</p><p>"Oh my! I believe it is time for the both of you to be on your way. Here are your lunches. I hope you both have a good day."</p><p>"I am sure we will Kasumi. Take care of yourself. You to daddy."</p><p>"Oh my baby girls are becoming so grown up. Whaaaa…"</p><p>Nabiki and Akane rushed out of the house as fast as they could knowing that if they stayed they would never escape the bear hug their father was planning for them. Then his tiers would soak them. That was one thing that they both wanted to avoid at all costs.</p><p>About a block from the house they both slowed down to a walk. Figuring it was a safe enough distance from their father. The two girls began to laugh at their father's antics.</p><p>"That was a little close wasn't it?" Akane said gaining control of her laughter. She then developed a thoughtful look on her face.</p><p>Nabiki not one to overlook such things asked. "Hey what bothering you sis?"</p><p>"Oh nothing really. Its just I wish mom was here to be with us. I would have liked her to see us now. I wonder what she would think of how we turned out."</p><p>"Oh," Nabiki said a masked look also adorning her face. Akane noticed what she had done. Nabiki was one to always hide her feelings. It was the way she was. After the death of their mother it was one of the ways for her to escape the pain. The other being money.</p><p>"I'm sorry to be so depressing all of a sudden." Akane said as she looked back to the ground.</p><p>"It's all right sis. No harm done really. We all think about mom at one point or another."</p><p>So caught up were the two girls in their current thoughts that they did not see the boy just coming out of the gate in front of them. Nor did Akane realize she was about to run in to him. Knocking him over and falling on top of him.</p><p>"Watch where your going you dum…dum…dum…" Akane's words died in her throat as she looked into the boy's gray blue eyes. She felt his tight muscled chest under her. Being held by his strong arms. His handsome face wearing an intoxicating smile.</p><p>"I believe the word you are looking for is dummy right?"</p><p>"Yeah…right…dummy." Akane sighed out.</p><p>"Are you going to let me get up or are we going to lie here all day?"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry. She said getting up off of the boy." He stood helping her to her feet</p><p>"Well I guess that was my fault in a way there. I should have looked to see if someone was coming or not. I would like to stay and chat but I must be going. I don't want to be late for my first day of school. See ya around maybe. Especially you cute stuff." He said winking at Akane. With that he turned hoped up to a nearby roof and literally hopped away disappearing from sight.</p><p>"What an odd getup to be wearing to school." Nabiki commented as Akane watched in the direction he had left</p><p>"What do mean Nabiki? What was he wearing that was odd?"</p><p>"The red Chinese shirt and ankle tied black pants sis didn't you notice?"</p><p>"Uh, not really Nabiki."</p><p>"Oh and what did you notice about him then, hmm sis?"</p><p>"Oh his dark long braided hair, those gorgeous blue gray eyes, those wonderfully strong arms, and that great voice."</p><p>"Oh brother sis, lets get going before we're late for school."</p><p>The two then proceeded to run to school barely making it through the gate and into class before the late bell. Akane was surprised to see the boy she had run into earlier in her homeroom class. He looked her way and winked at her as she sat down. Bringing a blush to her face. The teacher soon came in taking roll call of the class. Akane paid close attention as the teacher called out the names of the class. Waiting for that particular voice to answer to his name.</p><p>"Morisoto, Kenchi?"</p><p>"Hear!" Came the reply.</p><p>Akane turned the name around in her mind as the teacher continued on down the list. Thinking of how she could properly introduce herself. As her name was called on the roster Akane called out the normal reply then went back to her thoughts until the class began.</p><p>When the lunch bell rang Akane made her way outside. She liked to eat outside at her old school when she could. When she got past the school doors she saw Nabiki sitting under a tree close by. She was about to join her older sister when she noticed Kenchi sitting alone off to the side of the building. With a grin on her face she proceeded to walk towards him. She took no more than three steps when her path was impeded.</p><p>"Oh how the sun doth shine on mine eyes. She is like the blossom of the first flower of spring. Oh how thy loveliness shines through these great halls. Please let mine ears hear the name of the goddess before me so that I may worship thee."</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Oh pardon mine rudeness. Tis it not proper for the superior to give his name first. I my fair damsel am Kuno Tatewaki, Shooting Star of Furincan High School."</p><p>"Look it's nice meeting you but there is someone I need to speak with. So if you would excuse me Kuno sempia I will be on my way."</p><p>As Akane started to step around the tall boy he again blocked her path but this time using a wooden boken. She looked back up to his face to see him smirking at her.</p><p>"Thow has not yet bestowed thy name upon thee. Would you deny thy greatness of thy name?"</p><p>"It's Tendo Akane now if you please I am in a hurry."</p><p>Akane again tried to step around the annoying boy but still he blocked her way using his boken.</p><p>"She be yet light but fierce. I would honor thee to date with me my sweet Tendo Akane."</p><p>"I don't feel like it. Now get out of my way."</p><p>"Ahh, so it is a challenge then? Very well if I defeat you, you shall date with me."</p><p>"You have got to be joking." Akane said getting into a ready stance. "Don't you know when a girl says no that she means no?"</p><p>"Apparently he doesn't."</p><p>"Kenchi!" Akane said looking behind the tall boy to see Kenchi staring at them.</p><p>"Stay out of this whelp. Tis none concern of yours."</p><p>"You know you really sound stupid when you talk like that."</p><p>"Who be you to talk such a way to the shooting star of Furincan High School."</p><p>"I am…"</p><p>"Ah but is it not the common to give thyn own name first? Very well then I am the rising young star of the kendo world. I am the shooting star of Furincan High School! Kuno Tatewaki age seventeen."</p><p>"Well as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted. I am Morisoto Kenchi heir to the all or nothing school of martial arts. While we are in the tone of introductions may I ask your name cutie?"</p><p>"Umm, my name's Tendo Akane heir to the Tendo School of anything goes martial arts. Formally Indiscriminate Grappling. Umm, not that I'm not grateful or anything but I can take care of this jerk."</p><p>"Well I just saw him bothering you and I thought you could use some help."</p><p>"Why? Because I'm a girl?" Akane asked her temper beginning to rise.</p><p>"Umm, Well partly."</p><p>"Partly? What's the other reason hmm?" Akane said advancing on Kenchi who was slowly backing away from her.</p><p>"Well because I know how bothersome jerks like him can be, and I actually wanted to meet you." He said again stepping back a step.</p><p>Akane stopped advancing on Kenchi and realized that she was about to deck the boy she wanted to get acquainted with. "Oh, umm I'm sorry. I kinda got carried away there. I didn't mean to do that I just get carried away sometimes." Akane blushed in embarrassment as Kenchi looked at her. His gaze seemed to soften and he started to smile.</p><p>"It's okay, I guess I can see your point. A lot of guys do put down girls as being the inferior, and weaker sex."</p><p>"Oh, and you know better I assume?"</p><p>"You bet. Just last month in fact I was visiting my great aunt. Now that is one tough old woman. When you get her mad she will really beat the living daylights out of you. She would then use you as meat for a meat grinder. Of coarse I still love the old ghoul."</p><p>While Akane and Kenchi where having their discussion Kuno was just standing there fuming for being ignored.</p><p>"Excuse me but doth thou hast a quarrel to ascertain with me."</p><p>"Pardon me sempia but the lady and I are having a discussion."</p><p>"You dare…"</p><p>"Dry up and die!" Akane shouted as she punched Kuno out of the schoolyard.</p><p>"Hmm, nice form there Akane."</p><p>"Thanks I think. So where douse our great aunt live?"</p><p>"China actually. She is one of the council members for a tribe of amazons in the region. How about you? Who taught you martial arts?"</p><p>"Oh umm, my father mainly. He taught me the basics so I could become the heir to the dojo. Since there is no male heir I was the only option left."</p><p>"Really? Why would that be the only reason he would have to teach you? Just because you're a girl dose not mean you can't run a dojo."</p><p>"My father is very traditional." Akane said while sitting down by a tree. Kenchi sat next to her while she again began to talk. "He believes in all the stuff about bushido and the proper place of a family. He is the type that wants to bring back old Japan."</p><p>"Well I guess there is nothing wrong with that. But he should realize that times change. Not only the people but also the places. A culture that does not grow to meet the challenges of the outside is a culture doomed for failure."</p><p>"Where did you hear a speech like that? From your aunt in China?"</p><p>"No, actually my grandmother used to say that a lot. My great aunt and my grandmother were at odds on that subject. You see my great aunt is a lot like your father. Yet she lives in this wacky amazon village in China that believes it is the woman's place to rule over men. Grandmother never liked that though. She believed as I do that both women and men are very equal. It is true that we have our differences but that does not mean that a woman cannot fight, lead, or think as well as a man, or a man as well as a woman."</p><p>"Your grandmother sounds like a very wise woman."</p><p>"She was."</p><p>"Was?"</p><p>"She passed on about two years ago. She had been very sick for a while and it finally caught up with her."</p><p>"I'm sorry. You sound like you loved her very much."</p><p>"Yes I did. I live with my aunt now that is why I am going to this school since my aunt decided to move back from China to here. You see my grandmother used to live in Tokyo before she went to visit my great aunt in China. I have been either with my grandmother, my aunt, or my great aunt."</p><p>"What about your parents?"</p><p>Kenchi's face became even sadder than when he was talking about his grandmother when Akane brought up his parents. "I never really knew my parents." He said looking down at his hands. " All I know about them is that my father is dead and my mother couldn't take care of me after his death. I don't know if she is even alive."</p><p>Akane started to look at her hands at that moment. Thoughts of her own family running through her head.</p><p>"Have I depressed you Akane? I am sorry for that." Kenchi said looking sadly at her.</p><p>"Oh no! I'm sorry I was just thinking of my mother." Akane said looking towards Kenchi. "You see she died when I was younger. I just was thinking that I am glad that I have the memories of her that I do."</p><p>Akane was about to go into more detail when the warning bell for lunch went off. Akane looked at Kenchi and smiled at him.</p><p>"Well I guess we had better be going." Akane said getting up.</p><p>"I would like to talk again if we could?" Kenchi asked before Akane walked away.</p><p>"I would like that." She said. "How about you come over to our dojo? We could even spar."</p><p>"I don't think that is such a good idea Akane. Dojos tend to become demolished when I'm around. How about we meet in the park about an hour after school?"</p><p>"Sure I would love to Kenchi. It's a date then." Akane said before she quickly turned and ran inside the school doors. Kenchi stood there with a worried look on his face.</p><p>"A date?" He said, then running to the school himself so he wouldn't be late for his next class. Stepping on a still unconscious Kuno on the way inside. (Kenchi how do you always get yourself into these things.) He thought as he ran inside the school doors.</p><p>After the school let out Akane rushed home leaving a bewildered Nabiki in the dust. Nabiki had wanted to ask her sister about the rumors of her sitting with a boy at lunch. Or more accurately about the boy she had seen her sister with at lunch. She had been surprised to see Kuno Tatawaki laid out as he was when she was entering the school after lunch. He had been her biggest moneymaker at school. If he could be beaten then Nabiki was one to want to know everything about the person who could do it. It was lucky that the other students at school had not seen Kuno in his state.</p><p>Kuno had been the premier fighter at school the year before. It was rare to see one even better than him. From what Nabiki had gathered of the Kuno clan they were not ones to contend with. They were a very wealthy family. A family Nabiki herself would love to become a part of. But they were also a bit eccentric. Tatawaki himself had a thing for talking like he was from the European middle ages while his sister as far as Nabiki had learned was one to get what she wanted at her all girls school. She was a part of that schools rhythmic gymnastics team. It was rumored that the girl had a thing for attacking other schools teams so they could not compete against her. Nabiki could not find out much about the father and mother of the Kuno clan. They had disappeared earlier in the young Kuno's childhood. It was believed that the mother had died and that their father had lost his sanity due to her death.</p><p>Either way Nabiki had to find out about the boy who could defeat the greatest fighter at Furincan High School. If not for the informational value to the school, then for her own curiosity. If she could get such a fighter in her corner either through blackmail or other methods she would be set for life. No one would be able to touch her. First though she would have to get something on him. So far all she had was a name. Soon it would be much more.</p><p>(Morisoto Kenchi by the end of the week I will have you eating out of my hand.) Nabiki thought as she continued on her way home. A wicked smile appeared on her face as she thought of all the money she would be raking in from her ventures of this new martial artist.</p><p>Akane had rushed home quickly from school. It was rare for someone like her to meet someone like Kenchi. He was nice, considerate, a little fast in the mouth but she could work around that, very handsome and most of all he said she was cute. She couldn't wait to talk to him again. She couldn't believe that this was happening to her. Love at first sight was supposed to happen only in the movies wasn't it? Now it had happened to her. But what a guy for her to fall in love with if it was love that is. But if it wasn't didn't love start with this sort of attraction any ways?</p><p>Akane began to think of Dr. Tofu. He had been the only man she had known to treat her with the type of understanding that she craved. Could Kenchi give her the same? She hoped he could. After all Dr. Tofu was lost to her because of her sister Kasumi. What was worse Kasumi seemed to not have a clue that there even was an attraction. Akane had hoped for a long time that the good Doctor would look to her instead of her sister. She had even grown her hair out like Kasumis' to impress him. He seemed to like long hair after all.</p><p>Akane wondered if Kenchi preferred long hair or short hair. Dr. Tofu had said she looked like a boy with short hair. That day had been really hard on Akane. She had been in a really big fight with one of the boys at school and had scraped herself up. Kasumi had taken her to see Dr. Tofu. He had fixed up her hurts in no time. It had made her feel good to have him touch her. He was gentile and kind. That is until Kasumi had started to speak to him and he had started to act all weird.</p><p>Akane found herself looking into the mirror. She wondered why boys couldn't look at her the way they look at Kasumi. It was true that Kasumi acted all sweet and innocent but did they see the real her. They only saw the outside. What Kasumi wanted them to see. Akane then started to wonder if she had seen the real Kasumi. Akane had remembered a time when all Kasumi could think about was school and helping mother around the house. She also remembered a Kasumi who loved to help people. Not much had changed in that regard Akane thought. But now Kasumi was stuck in the role of being a mother, a sister, and a homemaker before she had finished her childhood. Akane had never even seen her sister go out on an actual date in her life. Was that what it took to attract a guy in that way. To lose your independence and own free thought? That is not what Akane wanted. She wanted to be herself. She wanted to be a teacher of martial arts. She did not want to sit around all-day and clean house.</p><p>Akane looked at her watch and saw that it was almost time to meet Kenchi. She hurriedly put her workout gi on and raced out of her bedroom door. She saw Nabiki exiting her room as she reached the stairs. Waving to her sister and ignoring the strange look her sister gave her Akane raced down the stairs and into the Kitchen where Kasumi was making something already for dinner.</p><p>"Kasumi," Akane said as she entered the kitchen. "I will be going to the park to work out with someone today so don't wait up for me at dinner Okay."</p><p>"Oh my, don't be too late Akane. And please tell father that you will be out. You know how he worries."</p><p>"I will Kasumi. See ya!"</p><p>Akane then made her way to the dojo where she found her father doing a kata. It was a rarity to see him do one these days. Usually he would just sit around on the verandah looking out over the yard. Waiting for the few meager students that he had these days to show up. Akane hoped it was a sign that he was getting better.</p><p>"Father," she said as she entered the dojo.</p><p>"Ah Akane, how are you this afternoon daughter."</p><p>"I am fine father," she said bowing to him. "I am about to go out to meet a new friend in the park."</p><p>"That is great news! It is nice to see that you are making some new friends Akane. I only have seen you with Yuka and Sayuri. They are fine friends true but you need to meat more people as well. So what is your little friends name Akane?"</p><p>"His name is Kenchi father she said as she headed out of the dojo."</p><p>"His?" Soun said as he watched his youngest daughter run from the dojo. Souns' eyes began to water as he thought of his little girl going out to meet a boy. Then his eyes got wide as he realized that his little girl was going out to meet a boy. Soun fell to his knees and started to blubber that his little baby was to young to be in the company of boys. "Oh what is a father to do?" He blubbered out.</p><p>Kenchi was already waiting in the park as Akane arrived. He smiled at her as she ran up to him. His gray blue eyes shining in the late afternoon sunlight. "Are you ready Akane?" He asked as she got close enough for her to hear him. She looked at him as he got into a fighting stance.</p><p>Nodding her head she got into her own fighting stance waiting for him to attack. But all he did was stand there looking at her. Akane's impatience got the better of her and she attacked with all of her power. The next thing she knew she was lying face up on the ground looking into the big blue sky. Akane sat up and saw Kenchi smirking at her. That got her temperature rising so she got back up and attacked again. Going for a punch kick combination. Again she found herself on her back with Kenchi starring down at her with that same smirk on his face.</p><p>"What are you smiling at!" She yelled out kicking up towards his face. He deftly caught her foot and started to tickle it. Akane couldn't help but laugh out loud at him tickling her foot. She hoped he couldn't see her embarrassment of him getting the better of her so easily. She finally freed her foot and scooted back from him. Her head bowed low looking into her lap.</p><p>"What's wrong Akane?" Kenchi said walking up to her. "Are you already through sparing?" Akane looked up into his face tiers showing on her face. "Akane?" Kenchi said as he noticed her tiers. "Oh no I didn't hurt you did I?" He asked kneeling down beside her.</p><p>"No," she said looking into his face trying to hold back the tiers of shame she felt on her cheeks. "I don't know why I'm even crying." She lied as she watched his concerned eyes on her.</p><p>"Come on Akane what's wrong then? If you are not hurt then why are you crying?"</p><p>Would he understand? She thought as she looked into his concerned gray blue eyes. Maybe he will.</p><p>"I thought I was the best." She finally said to him looking again into her lap. "My father brought me up to be the best in the art. Then here you are beating be so easily. How can I say I can teach if I am such a lousy martial artist."</p><p>Kenchi began to laugh at Akanes' statements. Which really began to irritate her. "Fine see if I tell you anything again!" She yelled out. She started to get up when Kenchi put a hand on her shoulder. Making her sit back down.</p><p>"Akane, how can you think that being the best is the only way you can teach the art? I know a lot of so called masters that I can take down just about as fast as you. I will tell you this much Akane. When you think that you are the best be prepared to lose because there is someone better waiting around the corner. How long have you been training Akane?" He asked out of the blue.</p><p>"Since I was young. Every afternoon for about an hour before dinner. Then maybe an hour after before bed. Why?" Akane asked irritated.</p><p>"Because Akane for me training doesn't stop when it is dinnertime, or when I go to sleep. I train every day. At all times. Even when it looks like I am resting I am still training myself. You on the other hand have not had the training that I have had. It is understandable that you were just beaten. Do not beat yourself up about it. After all you will only get better right?"</p><p>Akane smiled at Kenchi as he smiled back at her. "Now why don't you get back up and I will show you why you were put on your back so easily." He said with a chuckle. Akane, still smiling, stuck her tong out at him. She then got up and aloud Kenchi to show her the holes she had in her defense. She also realized that not only was Kenchi a good fighter but also a good teacher. He was showing her the things she needed to know and yet being patient with her until she got it right. They kept this up for two hours until Akane could take no more and fell to her knees panting. She had never worked so hard in her life. Kenchi had really pushed her in that brief two hours. Yet he was barely showing any signs of fatigue at all.</p><p>"Kenchi, just how good are you?" She asked while regaining her breath.</p><p>Kenchi got a far away look in his eye when he began to think about Akane's question. He then looked right at her. His eyes bore the look of seriousness and determination.</p><p>"Akane I will answer your question on a couple of conditions. One you will have to promise on your honor as a martial artist and your family name that you will never reveal what I am about to tell you. I also want you to promise to listen to everything I say before you even utter a word."</p><p>"OK, but why?"</p><p>Kenchi sat down beside her sighing as he did so. He then turned to face her again and started to speak.</p><p>"You see Akane I am very good. But I am very good because I have paid a very high price. When I was six years old I found out about an ancient martial arts technique that magnifies the potential of a martial artist ten fold. I was taught this technique by one of my uncles in the hopes that I would succeed where he had failed. I almost lost my sanity thanks to that day. It was that technique that killed my father, and my grandfather. My uncle died as a result of the training too. I am the only one of my line who has learned it and survived. Because of this training though I had a very bad phobia. If my phobia was unchecked and I was exposed to that stimulation for to long I would start to act crazy. I would become very dangerous when I was like that. The only one so far who could ever bring me back to sanity was my grandmother. It is because of my phobia that I was first brought to my great aunt."</p><p>"You must understand Akane my great aunt is very wise. Her first reaction when she had learned that I was trained in such a technique was fear. Then anger at the fool who taught me it in the first place at such a young age. If I was left as I was back then I would be still very dangerous if I was every over exposed to the trigger. You see back then I was not fully trained in the technique. My uncle only started the training through a manual that he found. My grandmother being one who knew the full training decided that I would have to be fully trained in order to protect others as well as myself."</p><p>"Through her efforts and that of my great aunts I now have a lot more control over the technique and myself. If others knew that I had such power they might try what was done to me on themselves or worse their students. That would be very dangerous. As I said I am the only one in my line who has survived the initial training. Even though I have control over it though there is still that chance that I might lose that control over my sanity. It is a very scary thought. I never want to hurt anyone. So I try not to get in to many fights that can be avoided. I will fight to help others, but not for my own personal gain. Or to prove that I am simply the best. I know in my heart how good I am. I do not need to beat up others to see that."</p><p>"If others started to spread around how good I really am then I would get a lot of pointless challenges to fight for pointless reasons. I will admit this right hear and now Akane. I do not feel that fighting over something as pointless as to see who will go out with who is worthy of a true martial artist. A true martial artist will fight if there is danger to others. If there is a fight that is worth fighting for that is it. I would rather fight to protect my friends and family than to get a prize of a golden trophy, a title of the best there is any day."</p><p>"I am sorry if I am rambling Akane but it is an issue that is very important to me. That is why when I say that I could probably beat almost any master that is in Japan right now I do not want people to know about it."</p><p>"Are you truly that good?" Akane asked meekly.</p><p>"Yes Akane, I am that good. But being that good can be a hindrance as it is a great title."</p><p>"I guess I see your point." Akane looked closer into Kenchi's soft eyes. She found that while he was speaking she was drawn in to his voice. She found that she liked the way his sense of honor kept him at a point that he would never outright insult anothers art. If he was truly as good as he said he was then she wouldn't be even close to him in skill. Yet he never really insulted her in their sparing. All he did was push her to do better. To go beyond what she was right now. He didn't go out to just beat her. All he did was show her what she did wrong.</p><p>Akane felt stirrings inside that she had never felt before for this boy in front of her. Most boys were egotistical, obnoxious, immature, and hormone driven idiots. Kenchi had thrown that view out the window. He was showing a maturity that Akane had seen in very few others. Not even her father could match what she was seeing in this boy in front of her.</p><p>"I bet you have a lot of admirers after you Kenchi." Akane said out of the blue. "I can see how you could attract a lot of women to you."</p><p>Kenchi started to chuckle at that remark. His chuckle soon turned into a full-blown laugh. Akane looked at him strangely as he tried to control his laughter.</p><p>"Did I say something funny?"</p><p>"A…A…Akane Y…y…you don't understand how funny it is to me. You see because of my martial arts I was almost married to my cousin no less."</p><p>"What?" Shouted Akane her eyes growing as big as saucers.</p><p>"You remember that I said that my great aunt in the head of a tribe of these weird Chinese Amazons right?"</p><p>Akane nodded her head.</p><p>"Well one of their laws is that if a male is to defeat a female they are to marry them. Luckily I got out of it."</p><p>"How?" Akane asked very curios.</p><p>Kenchi got a worried look on his face when that particular question was asked. He then sighed and stood up. "Akane this is even a bigger secret than the one I told you before. It is not only a secret of mine to keep but that of many. For if word were to get around about this it could get very nasty."</p><p>Kenchi motioned Akane to follow him. Akane got up and followed Kenchi to where a fountain was placed near the center of the park. He then looked around to make sure no one was watching. After making sure all was clear Kenchi splashed himself with the water inside the fountain.</p><p>Akane gasped with surprise at what she saw. Where once stood the love of her life now stood a buxom red head with pouty lips and blue eyes. She was about two feet shorter than Kenchi and about half a foot shorter than herself. She was very shapely though. She was the type of girl that would make any guy turn their heads to get a look.</p><p>"Wh…wha…wha…what's going on?" Akane stuttered out. The shock written clearly on her face.</p><p>The girl that had replaced Kenchi looked up at Akane with sad eyes that cut through some of Akane's shock. The girl sighed and sat down at the edge of the fountain. She looked down at her lap a blank expression coming on to her face.</p><p>"Akane I will understand if you hate me now. She said in a depressed voice. I am used to it after all. No one really should be with a freak like me after all."</p><p>Part of Akane wanted to agree with the girl. Yet there was a stronger part of her that saw the girl before her as a person who needed a friend. Someone lonely who was reaching out. Who had put their trust in her. She berated herself for her foolishness. Akane herself had been in such a way herself. Wasn't it just this morning that she had been hoping to find someone to relate to, someone who was different from the norm. Now she was about to reject what she was hoping to find because she didn't understand it.</p><p>With a sigh Akane walked over and sat down by the sad looking red head. "So which are you?" Akane asked looking at the red head.</p><p>The girl looked at Akane, confusion crossing her face.</p><p>"Well, what are you a boy or a girl?"</p><p>"A boy," the girl said looking back at her lap. "A boy who happens to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water."</p><p>Akane again felt guilty of her first thoughts concerning the girl beside her. "It must really be hard on you with this…this…"</p><p>"Curse," said the girl with a sigh. "It's a curse, I've had it for about six years now."</p><p>"How did it happen?" Akane asked, her interest peaked.</p><p>"Do you really want to know?" Asked Kenchi looking at Akane in surprise.</p><p>"Yes," Akane answered smiling at the girl in front of her.</p><p>"Well when I was ten my grandmother took me to see my great aunt like we did every summer to train…"</p><p>(Authors Note: From here on the characters will be speaking Chinese.)</p><p>"Kenchi remember what I told you about upsetting Cologne. She is the elder of the tribe. A tribe of people with the women who are in charge mind you so please show her a bit of respect this time."</p><p>"Don't worry grandmother the old goat and I have an understanding. She teaches and I learn. It's been like that for the last four years grandmother. Just like how you train me in martial arts and my schooling grandmother."</p><p>"Kenchi, when are you going to learn that people do not always like a smart mouth? You have to realize that the culture here is much different than ours. They have different rules and customs that can get you in trouble if you say or do the wrong thing."</p><p>"Oh don't worry grandmother. That is why I have you and the old ghoul here for. So I don't always stick my foot in my mouth."</p><p>That is a chore for my niece as well as for myself." Came a voice from up the path.</p><p>"Aunty Mummy!" Said Kenchi with a smile on his face.</p><p>"Who's a mummy?" Said the voice. Out from behind a rock jumped out a short old woman with long white hair. She wore a green outfit and was balancing on top of a large walking stick that was about two times her height.</p><p>"It is good to see you Aunt Cologne." Kenchi's grandmother said bowing to the old woman.</p><p>"It is good to see you too my dear. It has been to long a wait for your visit. I am especially excited to see you Dishwater."</p><p>Kenchi's grimaced when his aunt called him that. Just because of that one incident with that kitchen sink his aunt had since started to call him dishwater. That wasn't even his true amazon name either. Though he didn't like that name much better. Imagine having to be named after a certain brand of detergent.</p><p>"Well it is sure nice to see you to aunt prune face."</p><p>"I am sure Prune would not like that comment Dishwater."</p><p>"Oh yeah your right Prune doesn't even come close to looking as much of a mummy as you do aunty."</p><p>"One of these days boy you will learn it is I who will always be the superior here. You are two hundred years to young to match wits with me."</p><p>"Yeah I'm also missing the bandages to boot aunty."</p><p>Kenchi walked by the fuming amazon with his grandmother behind him shaking her head.</p><p>"Wait Kenchi," called Cologne before he walked to far ahead.</p><p>"Yeah aunty," he replied.</p><p>"You are not yet to go to the village young one. Niece please go it is time for Kenchi to be tested on his progress."</p><p>"But Aunt Cologne we just got here."</p><p>"Precisely, she said giving the old woman a hard stare. This way I get to see what the boy needs to ketch up on."</p><p>"I think you may be surprised Aunty. I personally think I have gotten better since last we met."</p><p>"Will shall see my boy."</p><p>"Ah very well I shall see you both back in the village." With that said Kenchi's grandmother gathered her things and made her way to the Amazon village.</p><p>Cologne and Kenchi both stood until she was out of sight. Then both of them began to laugh out loud at the troubled old woman.</p><p>"I think you are going to run her to an early grave my boy."</p><p>"You think so aunty? I know grandmother she is on though old bird just like you."</p><p>"Yes she is tough but she lacks my constitution. Any way we do need to get on with the test."</p><p>"You mean you really are going to test me now?"</p><p>"Now is as good as a time as any."</p><p>Kenchi smiled knowing what an honor it was for his aunt to test him as such. Usually she would wait until after the summer was almost up. Then she would put him up with one of the higher-ranking males in the village. He thought about the last one he had defeated. That had been last summer. The Amazon male had been one of the best in his generation. He also was a good friend of Kenchi's.</p><p>For his aunt to test him herself though. It meant that he would finally be able to pit his skills against one of the best martial artist he had known. For a elder to test you was a major honor. For the best of the elders to test you was one of the greatest honors. Not only did it attest to his abilities, but also a fact that she was testing a male in itself was astonishing.</p><p>"Are you ready Kenchi?" She asked a smile on her face.</p><p>"Any time your old bones can get moving aunty."</p><p>As the fight started Cologne did find herself surprised at the skill of her great nephew. He had in fact surpassed many in the village. And at the age of ten he had even surpassed the abilities of the other elders of the tribe though they would not admit to it. It was by sheer force of will that she could even keep up with him. That is if she did not use her special skills. He had already learned the dance of the dragon technique. Not only that but he had found a counter for it in no time. It had been the same for the chestnut roasting on an open fire technique and the breaking point. All that was left for him was to learn to use his chi and then he could truly be spectacular.</p><p>Cologne found herself pressed back because of her lack of attention. The boy had indeed gained in skill over the winter. She backed off from him to gather herself from the hits she was taking from the boy.</p><p>"You are indeed skillful young one but let's see if you can handle something a little more complicated." Cologne started to circle Kenchi. Then as she circled she seemed to split herself into multiple reflections of herself.</p><p>Kenchi smiled at the old woman as she did this. Remaining perfectly still he allowed his senses to extend beyond himself. Searching for the aura in which all-living beings poses.</p><p>"Behold Kenchi a technique known only to few. The splitting cat hairs." Cologne then began to strike Kenchi using her cane. To her surprise each blow was deflected. She then noticed as she was circling the boy that he always kept his eyes right on her.</p><p>"Well aunty it seems that that technique didn't work to well. How about this? Katchu Tenshin Amurerican!" So surprised was the old woman that the boy actually detected her so fast that she wasn't prepared for the five hundred sixty four punches that connected with her in a single second. Being thrown out of her Cat Hairs technique. Cologne was only dazed for a second though. She realized that if she did not act fast she would lose. And for a amazon of her caliber to lose to a ten-year-old boy was disgraceful. Cologne again started to circle the boy. But this time instead of a circle she started to spiral around him. Kenchi followed her into the spiral, thinking he had her at the disadvantage.</p><p>"Hyru-Shouten-Ha!" Cologne shouted all of a sudden extending her fist in the air.</p><p>The next thing that Kenchi knew he was flying through the air in a tornado. The initial blow might have knocked a lesser man out. Kenchi on the other hand had been trained well and knew how to take such a blow. It was the fact that he was very high in the air and beginning to fall that worried him. He then saw that he was falling towards a valley of springs. He twisted himself so he would land in a spring to break his fall.</p><p>Cologne smiled as she saw Kenchi fly off. Then her smile turned into a frown as she saw how far he was up. Her frown turned into a look of horror as she saw where he was going to land. Cologne instantly took off after Kenchi hoping beyond hope that he would somehow miss the springs of Jusenkyo.</p><p>When Cologne reached the springs she instantly found the guide. He was looking around a look of confusion on his face. Spotting Cologne he walked over to her.</p><p>"Ahhh, elder Cologne of the Jusendo tribe of amazons. What brings you hear to the cursed springs of jusenkyo?"</p><p>"I am searching for my nephew. Has he fallen around here? He was hit in this direction."</p><p>"I heard a splash Cologne, but I have not seen no one or nothing come out of the springs once I made my way out here."</p><p>"You mean he hit a spring! Oh by the ancients no."</p><p>"He may have drowned in one of the springs for all I know Cologne. No loss to you though right? After all he was merle a male."</p><p>The guide received a whack to the head for his comment. As well as a hard glare from Cologne's wizened eyes.</p><p>"That was no mere male guide." She said annoyed at the guides' presumptuous actuation. Her voice held a twinge of fear in it as she thought of the boy. Especially if he was truly lost. He was her niece's last hope for a heir of their version of the art. It was true that their family still had Shampoo but Kenchi had been so much more than her great granddaughter. It was frightening just how good the boy was. To lose him to the springs of jusenkyo would be heart breaking.</p><p>"Cologne!" Came a voice from behind the guide and the old amazon matriarch.</p><p>Cologne, along with the guide turned to see a red headed wet amazon standing in front of them.</p><p>"Yes, what is it child?" Asked Cologne trying to remember if she knew the girl.</p><p>The girls blue eyes grew dark as she viewed the two of them. "You will pay for what you have done to me Cologne." She said now starring at the old woman.</p><p>"What grievance do you have with me child?"</p><p>The young girl did not answer as she attacked the amazon matriarch. Cologne was surprised at just how good this young warrior was. The way the girl was fighting reminded her of Kenchi. Yet this red headed girl was much faster. The girl was also a bit more limber. She was a bit awkward though as if she did not know how to properly balance her own body. Cologne did not know of any other amazon village that knew of the techniques that this girl was performing. The stile in which the girl was using was too reminiscent of her own. Why with a little more balance training and practice the girl would be as good as Kenchi.</p><p>"Child I may be able to help you if you just explain to me what the grievance you have with me is. You look like an intelligent ten-year-old woman…"</p><p>"I am not a woman Aunt Cologne!"</p><p>"Kenchi, Cologne said with a gasp." Her eyes growing with astonishment, Cologne fell to her knees in shock.</p><p>The girl also fell to her knees mirroring the elder amazon. Her blue eyes filled with tiers of grief and sadness.</p><p>"It took me a while to forgive my great aunt for that day." Kenchi said as she looked back to Akane. "The months that followed my transformation we very trying. Not only that but I also had to put up with not only the girls of the amazon tribe but also the boys."</p><p>"Is this how I hear about why you were almost married to your cousin?"</p><p>"Yes I guess it is. You see when I turned fourteen the village said I was eligible to be married. Meaning that a female could challenge me by their laws for marriage since I was now of age. They could have done it sooner but my great aunt kept them off my back with the training she put me through."</p><p>"So the amazons all came after you with the intention of beating you so they could marry you?"</p><p>"Not quite, You see for a female to marry a male the male must defeat the female in a challenge. So they were going to challenge me then lose. My cousin was the first to get to me with the challenge. I had to think fast. After all I did not want to get married so soon in my life. My grandmother agreed with me while my great aunt wouldn't have mind if I were to marry her great granddaughter. She relented though and allowed me to continue with the solution I came up with."</p><p>"What was the solution Kenchi?"</p><p>"Heh…all they had to do to challenge me was to defeat my sister first."</p><p>"I thought you said you were an only chilled?" Akane asked skeptically.</p><p>A big smile appeared on Kenchi's face when Akane asked her that. She then stood up and turned facing Akane.</p><p>"Let me introduce myself. I am Linchi adoptive sister of Kenchi." She said bowing to Akane.</p><p>Akane started to chuckle as she got what Kenchi was implying. "So in order to be able to challenge you they had to defeat your girl side first."</p><p>"Most of them thought that my girl side and my boy side were separate. My cousin was a bit upset that I would make such a statement since she knew about my condition. I could hear her curses for the next two nights the first time I beat her in my girl form. You see in their society a boy was not supposed to be as good as I am. To marry me would have been the best thing that could happen for any of the amazons. But in order to be beaten by my male side, which my cousin thought that she could beat, anyway they had to first defeat me in my girl side. My cousin found out very quickly just how good I was. Let's just say she wasn't too happy about it."</p><p>"How about the boys? Did they have to defeat your boy side in order to challenge your girl side?"</p><p>"There was no need to do that with the boys Akane. You see in order for them to be able to marry me they would have to defeat my girl side. Like I said before if a male defeats a female he is her bride. Well according to their laws at any rate. I don't like the fact that a first date to them is a fight to see if you will be married."</p><p>"I guess that wouldn't be much of a first date. How do you turn back to a guy then Kenchi?"</p><p>"Oh that's easy Akane. I just need some hot water to change back. The curse is water based you see. So with cold water I become Linchi, and with hot water I will turn back to Kenchi. Though I have found ways to protect myself from becoming Linchi most of the time."</p><p>"Oh how?"</p><p>"That Akane is a secret that I am not allowed to tell you. I wish I could but the methods involved have been to guarded by a lot of martial arts masters. I am sorry."</p><p>"Oh that's okay I guess. Could you change back now? I kind of like the other you to look at."</p><p>"Oh okay." Kenchi concentrated for a second then he reached into the fountain cupping his hands. He then dumped the water in his hands over his head. Changing from the read headed girl back into the dark hared boy that Akane had met earlier.</p><p>"That is going to take some getting used to." Akane said gazing at Kenchi.</p><p>"Just imagine if you were the one doing the changing Akane."</p><p>Akane shuddered at the thought of changing into somethig other than her own body. Like changing into a slug or a fly. Or like Kenchi changing into the opposite sex.</p><p>"I see your point." She said looking down into her lap.</p><p>Kenchi again sat by Akane on the fountains edge. "I'm sorry for depressing you Akane. I guess I shot off my big mouth again."</p><p>"It's all right Kenchi. After all I was being inconsierate of your curse."</p><p>"It's all right Akane. I can admit you are the only one that hasn't walked off on me when I first revield the curse other than my great aunt."</p><p>"I thought you said that you had people chasing after you to marry you?"</p><p>"Most of them didn't know about my other half. The ones that did know shuch as my cousin and the twins did not treat me so kindly when they first found out. It hurts to be rejected by some of your closest friends. Luckly we made up about it. Unfortunatly my cousin decided that I would make a perfect husbend for her. Now that was interesting. When my best friend thought that I would make the perfect wife now that was a shock."</p><p>"And poor, poor Kenchi had to fight him off to make shure he stayed unwed." Akane chuckled out.</p><p>"I didn't just have to fight him Akane, I had to kick the crap out of him. The real thing that got to me though is that he seemed to enjoy getting beat up all the time he fought with me as Linchi. After each time I defeated him he would come ask me as Kenchi what my sisters weak points were so he could exploit them. Of course I never gave him any that would really work."</p><p>Kenchi looked at the sun as it began to set after its long treck through the sky. "It's getting late Akane. I would like to stay and talk more but I really must be going."</p><p>Akane took notice of the time and became worried. "Yeiks I didn't reallize that it was so late. Father and Kasumi probably have a serch party after me."</p><p>Well I will see you at school then Akane."</p><p>"Yeah and maby after school we can do this again."</p><p>"What, practice or talk?"</p><p>"Maybe both Kenchi."</p><p>Kenchi smiled at her and then turned to leave. Before he was out of earshot though Akane heard him say. "I would like that very much Akane. See you tomarow."</p><p>Akane had a great big grin on her face as she walked away from the park. She knew she had found someone special in Kenchi. She also reallized that she would never forget this day. It was all that she could hope for and more. She couldn't wait to see how her future turn out. (Hopefully it will have a lot more Kenchi in it.) She thought as she began to skip along to her home. Not an unhappy thought in her mind.</p>
