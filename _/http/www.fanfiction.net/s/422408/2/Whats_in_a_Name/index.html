</div>        Chapter 2<p>Ok just to let you know these characters are not mine. They belong to the wonderful lady who created them. They are also distributed by VIZ Video. I am not nor will not gain any money by writing this story. This story is just being written for fun that is all.</p><b><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 2</p><p style="text-align:center;">Here's Ranma?</p><p></p></b>In the time that Akane has spent with Kenchi they have grown inseparable it seemed. Nabiki being one to never like not knowing about someone had been growing more and more agitated as she continued to find very little on Kenchi. It was hard to even figure the guy out. Akane would almost always go out after school and do god knew what with him for hours it would seem like. Then she would come home tired yet always happy. They were considered an item at school now. Ever since Kenchi had quenched that crazy thing about the boys in school having to defeat Akane in order to date with her. Now only Kuno openly pursued Akane. He also found himself flying high over the sky via one of Akane or Kenchi's punches.<p>That was one of the few fights that he would participate in actually. It was hard to get Kenchi to fight at all. After all, she would know she had set up quite a few. However, he would turn down all the challenges thrown his way. Hardly anything would get him to fight. There was only one thing that she had seen that would rile the young martial artist. That one thing was of course her sister. He never liked to see Akane hurt what so ever. If a tier would even begin to show in Akane's eye Kenchi would be on the offender like a hound chasing a fox. Of course, most of the time the person was Kuno. He would make her sister cry by telling her that the lowborn ruffian that was Kenchi was just using her as a conquest. A trophy in his trophy case. A notch on his belt.</p><p>What was left over of Kuno after words like that, either from Kenchi or Akane was not pretty. There were days that she thought that Kuno would never recover from the injuries that he received. Not only did he recover though, but also he always seemed to come back for more. It was sad really. Kuno was handsome and best of all very rich. However, he had set his eyes on Akane and the mysterious sister of Kenchi's.</p><p>Now there was someone that begged to be spied on. This red headed girl came out of nowhere and is able to turn the heads of most of Furincan High School's students. Whether it is the boys out of lust, or the girls out of petty jealousy. Her beauty was very apparent even though she would dress like a boy most of the time. What she lacked in clothing style she made up for in natural beauty though. The girl was a knockout and then some. If she would apply herself and stop trying to look so much like her brother she could probably take any guy she wanted from the school. Of course she could probably do that already.</p><p>Nabiki had tried to have her followed once or twice yet the girl was a master of evasion. At one point one of her assistants would be following the girl then she would all of a sudden run into the girl's brother Kenchi. That being the end of the chase. It was only through her sister that Nabiki had found out what that girl's name was. Along with the relationship with Kenchi.</p><p>Linchi, she was a lot like her brother. Both dressing the same, and acting the same. It was almost like they were the same person. If it wasn't for Linchi's physical differences Nabiki would have said that the girl was probably Kenchi dressing up as a girl. Of coarse that was impossible. Linchi was much shorter than her brother was. The red hair she had was very real. Nabiki had gotten a sample of it after all. As well as some of her brothers. It was through those hair samples that one interesting fact came out.</p><p>Akane had told her that Linchi was the sister of Kenchi through adoption. That on one of his trips to China his family had found her abandoned and alone. They had taken her in and later adopted her. Yet according to the hair samples that were sent in the two could have been related by blood. The both of them were a genetic match. It was strange in itself how that would come to be. According to the note she had received with the test results the doctors would have accused her of sending two hairs from the same person if it wasn't for the hair color.</p><p>Nabiki was very deep in her thoughts when a knock came to her door. Nabiki turned up her head to the door in surprise. It wasn't often that someone would bother her when she was in her room. Her room had become her sanctuary from the others. And with her mercenary ways she was hardly ever bothered unless it was someone who needed to borrow money.</p><p>Come in, she said a gleam in her eye with the prospect of money making. That gleam turned into shock at the sight that entered her room. There stood Akane in a gold tight fitting sleeveless Chinese dress that was tide off at the waist with a white silk sash. The dress had a slit that went up the left side showing a fair amount of her leg. She had her hair tide back with a white bow and on her wrists were bracers like the type she would see Kenchi wear at school. The effect was breathtaking to say the least.</p><p>"So what do you think of the present Kenchi got me for our date this morning Nabiki?" Akane asked stepping into the room and closing her sister's door. "I knew not to confront Kasumi with it since you know how she acts so I wanted to get your opinion first. After all this will be our first official date. I still can't believe he actually asked me out on a real date not one of our sparring sessions."</p><p>The fact that Nabiki was shocked over the dress did nothing to help with her shock at those words. "He actually asked you out on a real date Akane?" She asked in amazement. Kenchi was very elusive he hardly ever went out. However, here he was taking her little sister out on her first date! And here she was not knowing a thing about it!</p><p>"Well do you think it looks good on me Nabiki?"</p><p>"Sis I think you will literally knock his block off with that thing you are wearing. So where is your mysterious boyfriend taking you today for you to have to wear a dress like that?"</p><p>"I'm not quite sure actually. He said it was a surprise. I hope I like it."</p><p>"Well sis I am sure that you will." Nabiki said with a hint of jealousy in her voice. "Although I don't think he will be paying that much attention to the date sis."</p><p>"What do you mean Nabiki?"</p><p>"What I mean is that in that outfit that you are wearing he will not be able to take his eyes off you."</p><p>"Do you really think so?" Akane asked as she blushed a bright red. Yet she made no move to change the outfit.</p><p>"Yeah I do think so. It would probably be better if you changed into something less daring sis." (So I can get my hands on the thing.) Nabiki thought still admiring the dress.</p><p>"It might be best if I do, but Kenchi gave it to me to wear. I wouldn't want to disappoint him." Akane said with a twinkle in her eye.</p><p>"Sis you aren't thinking of doing anything perverted with him are you?"</p><p>"Maybe a little." Akane said as her blush deepened. Yet a wistful smile also appeared on her face.</p><p>"And just how far is a little sis hmm?"</p><p>"Nabiki that's private!"</p><p>"Sis I am only looking out for your best interest here. I don't want you to do anything that you may regret later on."</p><p>"Why would I regret kissing and hugging him Nabiki?"</p><p>"If that is all you intend to do then nothing."</p><p>"You don't mean that you thought I would have sex with him do you?"</p><p>"Well you are getting kind of close to him."</p><p>"Nabiki! Neither of us are ready for that step in our relationship. After all this is only our first official date. It's not like I am going to walk up to him rip this dress off and say take me here and now. Come on Nabiki I'm not like that."</p><p>"That is some picture you paint their sis. Have we been doing a little fantasizing here and there?"</p><p>"Nabiki!" Akane yelled her face getting even redder than it was previously.</p><p>"I'm just kidding around Akane." Nabiki said laughing at the way her sister looked. Then her face got a little more serious. "Akane do you really like him so much though?"</p><p>Akane got a far away look on her face when Nabiki asked her that. She then looked at Nabiki straight in the eye and said. " Nabiki he means more to me than anything. I don't just like him Nabiki I think I love him."</p><p>"Akane you are only sixteen years old. How can you know what love really is?"</p><p>"I know Nabiki. This is much stronger than what I felt with Doctor Tofu. I would do anything for Kenchi Nabiki, anything. I…would even die for him." Akane said in a whisper that Nabiki only barely caught.</p><p>"Akane he had better not break your heart. I doubt there would be much left of him if he did."</p><p>Akane smiled and straitened up. She turned to the door but not before saying something to her sister before she left. "You may be right in that assumption Nabiki, you may be right." Akane quickly left the room after that leaving a very flustered Nabiki behind.</p><p>"Oh sis how did you get such a good one?" Nabiki turned and laid herself down upon her bed. She grabbed one of her mangna that she always kept around and opened the cover. Yet she couldn't read the words that were printed on the inside, as they became more and more blurry.</p><p>Akane thought about her sister's words as she made her way to the park where she was to meet Kenchi. Would she actually go that far for Kenchi? To die for him when she had only met him just a few weeks ago. Or better yet would he do the same for her. She knew she loved him dispite her sisters doubts. The feelings she held for Kenchi were so much stronger than what she felt with Doctor Tofu. When Kenchi would touch her it felt as if her skin was on fire. While a touch from Doctor Tofu only gave her a tingle of pleasure. What scared her though was that Kenchi had that effect on her. She knew dispite what she said to her sister that if Kenchi asked she would give herself to him. He held her heart in his hands and she couldn't get it back. Just like a mouse caught in the sights of a cobra or a fish on the end of a line she was hooked. All Kenchi had to do now was just reel her in. It was funny but she didn't mind that. He had taken her emotions to hights that she could not believe. In his gray blue eyes she had found a peace that would not let go. She wondered if love was always like this. A feeling of being hopelessly lost to someone and not able to get back to the reality of the world around.</p><p>As she spotted Kenchi sitting waiting for her in the park as he usually did her heart began to quicken. He was wearing a red Chinese stile shirt with a dragon embroidered on it. As well as some dress slacks. All in all it made him look very handsome. He smiled at her when she got near making her heart beat even faster.</p><p>"Are you ready Akane?" He asked standing up in front of her. He looked her up and down as he stood admiring the dress that she was wearing. Akane blushed as he looked at her. His eyes boring into her with a passion.</p><p>"How do you think the dress looks Kenchi?"</p><p>"You look like a princess Akane. A very beautiful princess at that."</p><p>The blush on Akane's cheeks grew brighter at Kenchi's compliment. "So where are you taking me today Kenchi?"</p><p>The smile on his face grew as he quickly stepped up to her and picked her up. " That my lovely princess is a surprise." He said as he jumped onto a tree branch then to a nearby rooftop.</p><p>Akane nearly fainted by the excitement of it. One thing though she was sure of. If the date had more of him holding her then she was going to enjoy it immensely.</p><p>They made their way through the city passing buildings at very high speeds. Akane couldn't keep up with everything as the buildings flew by. Soon the buildings seemed to disappear and she found herself in the forest outside of the Nerima district. Here Kenchi stopped and set her down. Akane looked around and found that she was standing on the edge of a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a log hung vertically by two wooden poles staked deep into the ground. Surrounding the log were various people all of which seemed to have some sort of weapon on them. It was strange but they all wore some sort of Chinese outfit. There was an assortment of people around with so many odd looking weapons that Akane could not even guess how they would be used. Except maybe to just bludgeon the opponent somehow.</p><p>"We should find spots to stand the tournament is about to begin." Kenchi said as he took Akane's hand in his, and proceeded to walk into the clearing. He led her to a spot close to the suspended log. There they watched as two females got onto the log. A old lady suddenly jumped onto the center of the log and started to say something in Chinese that Akane could not understand. Suddenly she raised a walking stick into the air and brought it down jumping off the log in the process. All of a sudden the two females attacked each other. The fight took several minutes as the two combatants moved in a fascinating dance of attacks and perries that were so elegant that Akane couldn't keep her eyes off of them. One of the combatants used a pair of short swords while her opponent used a Bo staff. Akane could see the elegance in each move of the combatants while they kept their balance on the supported log. Soon the battle was over the loser falling off the log when the winner had hit her with the staff that she used.</p><p>After the girl was named to winner she hopped backed up onto the log where another challenger awaited. While the other girls had been very beautiful this girl was very butch. The girl had two spiked maces in her hands. The old woman was again on the log holding up her staff and again brought it down while jumping from the log.</p><p>The battle this time was not one of elegance as the one before had been. The girl with the maces was very brutal in her attack breaking the other girls weapon on the fist strike. The girl with the broken staff tried to defend herself as best she could but nothing was stopping the growtestly muscled girl. She came in hard and fast getting a good hit on the girls left shoulder. Akane could see the blood that came from the spike that had penetrated the other girls shoulder.</p><p>Akane turned to Kenchi and saw that he was frowning at the girl with the spiked maces. His displeasure evident on his face and in his eyes. Akane turned back to the battle and watched in horror as the girl with the spiked maces knocked the other girl again in her left shoulder which sent her off the log to the ground where she landed roughly.</p><p>Kenchi was by the girl's side in an instant. Checking her injuries and patching them up as quickly as possible. He also pulled a vile from his pocket and had the girl drink it. The girl soon fell asleep and Kenchi relinquished her to a woman that had come up by Kenchi observing his work. Kenchi then turned to the girl with the maces.</p><p>"You have dishonored the tournament!" He shouted to her. "Those weapons are poisoned which are not aloud by the rules of the tournament. You should be disqualified for such actions."</p><p>The girl hopped down from the log and looked down at Kenchi like he was pond scum. The glare she gave him would have sent any other man to his knees begging for forgiveness. Kenchi on the other hand did not even flinch. He sent back a stare that could make an ice demon feel cold. The stare itself made the girl back off on her position. She recovered as quickly as she could and pointed at Kenchi.</p><p>"You should shut your mouth male. What do you know of anything? You should not address your superiors in such a disrespectful tone."</p><p>"Fine if I see a superior I will respect them. Unfortunately I don't see any at the moment."</p><p>There was a collective gasp around as Kenchi said that. Akane looked worriedly around her as murmurs started to spread through the crowd. It was evident that the crowed was not happy with either one of the two fighters. None of them were in the position to attack though. Each kept their eye on the two, waiting to see what would happen next.</p><p>"I challenge you male." The maced warrior shouted out. "No one says such things to Wen-chu and gets away with it."</p><p>"Wench?" Kenchi asked the girl in front of him. "Didn't your sister lose the tournament in China about a month ago?"</p><p>"What of it? Besides my name is Wen-chu not wench."</p><p>Whatever," Kenchi said as he faced the girl. "I will accept your challenge on two conditions."</p><p>"Oh and what are those conditions?"</p><p>"First of all this challenge can not be used for the kiss of marriage. The second is that when I win no others can challenge me after the fight is over."</p><p>The girl looked Kenchi up and down. Judging him it seemed to Akane as she watched from the sidelines.</p><p>"Very well then I accept your terms. This battle will not result in the kiss of marriage. However I can not speak for the others in the way of challenges."</p><p>The old woman from the log suddenly appeared in front of the two causing the girl to flinch. Kenchi however stood perfectly still as if he was expecting the woman.</p><p>"As the elder of this tournament I decree that no others shall challenge this youth after his bout with Wen-Chu." She turned to Kenchi, "and once this fight is over we may discuss the way you phrased that last sentence."</p><p>"Very well elder we just may." Replied Kenchi as he hopped up onto the log waiting for Wen-chu to follow.</p><p>After a second Wen-chu landed on the opposite side of the log from Kenchi. She attacked immediately not even waiting for the signal from the elder. She swung her mace directly at his head smiling in confidence as the deadly blow got closer to smashing the cocky male's head into pulp. Her smile was replaced with a look of confusion as her mace went through thin air. Her look of confusion was immediately replaced with one of pain as her extended hand erupted in agony. She screamed and dropped the extended mace. The other soon followed the first as her other hand erupted in pain also. It felt like a hundred hot needles were poking into each one of them. The girl did not have time to recover as she found herself tumbling end over end to the ground where she lay not being able to move at all.</p><p>There were gasps from all around the crowd as the girl was defeated so easily in only a few seconds. Not only was she defeated but by a male no less. The elder stood over the fallen girl in amazement not even moving an inch until Kenchi stood right in front of her.</p><p>She then looked at him a questioning expression on her face. "Where did you learn all that boy? And from who?"</p><p>"Most of my skills were achieved in China. I had two main sensais the first was my grandmother the second was Cologne leader of the Junsendo tribe of Amazons."</p><p>At this pronouncement the old woman's eyes grew wide with disbelief. "You are related to the elder Cologne?" The woman asked in disbelief.</p><p>"You might say that." Kenchi said as he eyed the women around him. They were giving him some very lecherous looks. He spotted Akane who was looking at him in confusion. He walked over to her and placed a hand on her shoulder. "I'm sorry I got into that Akane. All I wanted to do was take you to this tournament on our date I didn't expect to become part of it." He said looking softly into her eyes.</p><p>Akane looked into his soft blue eyes and melted inside. " It's all right Kenchi after all you couldn't stand around and watch that cheater win. It would be…"</p><p>"Big Brother Kenchi!" A voice shout out from the crowd. The next thing Akane knew a little bundle of green had attached itself to Kenchi. Akane felt a bit of jealousy at the seen before her. Then the words caught up to her. "Big Brother Kenchi?" She asked of the flustered martial artist before her.</p><p>Kenchi was just plain shocked into silence until the girl that was currently using him as a stuffed toy looked up into his face. "Lung-Lung?" He asked his voice becoming humorous.</p><p>"Yes, is good to see Big Brother Kenchi. What surprise meet here of all places." She said letting him out of her glomp.</p><p>Akane looked upon the young girl as she backed away from Kenchi. The girl was around nine or ten years old with red ankle tied pants with a blue yellow trimmed top. Which had a red heart on it. It was tied off at the waist with a white sash. The girl had green hair tied into a single bun on the back of her head with two locks hanging down in front of her ears. Looking at the girl's expressive blue eyes Akane couldn't help but to think of how cute the girl looked.</p><p>"Why are you here Lung-Lung, and where is your sister Ling-Ling?" Kenchi asked looking around for her.</p><p>"Ling-Ling back in village. She get sick from too too bad cold. Could not come see overseas tournament like Lung-Lung. She be so mad when Lung-Lung tell her she see Big Brother Kenchi at tournament."</p><p>"Big Brother Kenchi?" Akane said getting his attention.</p><p>"Oh where are my manners. Akane this is Lung-Lung an amazon sister of mine. Lung-Lung this is Akane a very special friend of mine."</p><p>"Kenchi have girlfriend?" Asked Lung-Lung in surprise. Akane could also detect a hint of sadness in the girl's voice. "You might say that." Kenchi said with a bit of a smirk.</p><p>The girl turned to Akane looking her up and down "How you defeat Linchi. You no look like you can."</p><p>Akane smiled at the girl knowing what she meant. After all Kenchi had told her some of the laws of the amazons. Especially the one that concerned marriage to an outsider. And how she could get around the kiss of death if she were to ever defeat an amazon. Akane crouched down near the young amazon whispering in her ear.</p><p>"I snuck up on her while she was taking care of a boy trying to glomp her and hit her on the head with a mallet."</p><p>Lung-Lung's eyes grew big then she went over to a tree and proceeded to bang her head against it.</p><p>"Why we not think of that?" She said while continuously hitting her head against the tree.</p><p>"We had better get going Akane." Kenchi said seriously. " While the elder did say that no other would attack me I don't quite trust the looks on some of the faces of the girls around here."</p><p>Akane looked around and noticed the lecherous looks of the girls surrounding them. She looked at Kenchi and nodded at him. He then picked her up in his strong arms and proceeded to disappear with her in the forest. Akane held on to him enjoying the warmth of his body so close to hers. She couldn't believe how right it felt being in his arms. All to quickly to Akane Kenchi was setting her down on the soft grass of the park that they had left from. Akane looked up into his eyes still holding her arms around his neck. Not quite wanting to let go of the boy in her arms.</p><p>"Akane?" He asked as he looked into her eyes getting lost in the love and passion that he saw in her big dark brown eyes.</p><p>"Kenchi I had a good time." Akane said never taking her eyes off of him. She brought herself closer to him willing him to go that extra step to bring their lips together in a sweet caress. She closed her eyes hoping beyond hope that he would take that step. She felt an electric shock go down her spine as she felt his lips touch hers. It was so wonderful. All too soon he pulled away from her. His caring blue gray eyes boring into her.</p><p>Kenchi then stepped back from her. He turned his back to her as his back stiffened. Akane was frightened by his actions. (Have I moved to fast? Oh please don't push me away Kenchi please.)</p><p>Kenchi then turned back to her a look of determination on his face. "Akane, I know we have only known each other for a short time but I need to say this." He let out a sigh closing his eyes and then opening them again staring right into hers. "Akane you may reject me after I say this but I love you. Please don't say anything yet. As I said I know we have only known each other for a short time but I already know I couldn't live my life without you." Kenchi then got down on one knee never taking his eyes off of hers. "Akane someday in the future would you consider marrying me?"</p><p>Saying this he pulled out the most beautiful ring Akane had ever laid her eyes on. It was gold with a phoenix and a dragon woven around each other up into the biggest diamond Akane had ever laid her eyes on. She looked up from the ring and into his eyes. The fear and apprehension were clearly showing there. A million thoughts sprang to her mind of the pros and cons of what he was offering. Even though her mind was in such turmoil she knelt on both knees in front of him, and took the ring. The word yes springing to her lips.</p><p>The sheer joy on his face as the word came out of her mouth was enough to send any doubts she had out the window. He then took the ring back from her then slipped it onto her finger. Then pulled her in for another kiss. This one lasting for much longer than the last one.</p><p>When they separated again due to lack of oxygen Kenchi again began to speak. "Akane I know we have a long way to go before we could even get married but I love you so much. I have never felt this way towards anyone."</p><p>"Oh Kenchi I know what you mean. Of coarse I'm not quite ready to get married quite yet. We're only sixteen after all. I would like to wait until after we have graduated first." She said with a chuckle. Her face then took on a look of shock of what she had agreed to. More importantly what her family would think of what she agreed to. "Kenchi there is a condition to this though."</p><p>The fear in his eyes was unmistakable to miss. He had always let his emotions show to her. She quickly spoke to reassure him. "I mean you haven't even met my family yet. And I haven't met yours yet either. Now that I am your fiancée you have no excuse to not come to the dojo. I would also think that your family would like to meet me to."</p><p>"Oh…um…Akane…you see there may be a problem with you meeting my aunt. You see she gets kind of protective of me. I sometimes wonder if she would like me to stay single forever and not see anyone at all. It was all I could do to convince her that her baby nephew needed to go to school."</p><p>"What do you mean Kenchi?" Akane asked looking at him in confusion.</p><p>"Well you see Akane. Her son died at a young age and I am her only family left after my uncle died a few years ago so she gets a bit protective. She doesn't want to see anything happen to me you see. Even though it seems she is smothering me with her protective ways." He sighed and sat down on the ground. "Akane I love her very much but it is hard to live with someone that is constantly trying to push you down. A person like that never really lets a person fly like they can. My aunt is a good woman but I am afraid that she will not let me be who I truly am. Or let me be with the person I truly wish to be with."</p><p>"I think I understand how you feel Kenchi. My father is a lot like that. After all you saw how I was before you started to train me. In a way my father was training me to become dependent on another. Never allowing me to be what I know I could be someday. Yet he douse it by loving to much. I guess he needs to see that there is a time that he needs to let go. It is the same with your aunt Kenchi. But also you need to make her see that you must be let go of.</p><p>She leaned in again and kissed him gently on the lips enjoying the sensation of it. "Kenchi I love you so much." She breathed into his mouth. She hugged herself tight into him. "The only question now is when are you coming over to meet my family baka?"</p><p>Kenchi smiled as he held her close. He couldn't believe he had found someone like Akane. He knew he had made the right choice. He just hoped his aunt felt the same. "Akane, after school tomorrow I will come over and meet your family OK? I can't do it today though. This afternoon I am going to explain you to my aunt."</p><p>"It will be all right Kenchi. I'm sure she will understand. Just like my father will have to understand. We will make them understand. No one or no thing will take you away from me Kenchi. I won't allow it."</p><p>Kenchi released Akane from their embrace cupping his hand on her face. "Until tomorrow then my lovely Akane. I will see you at school. I love you Akane. I always will." He kissed her one last time then turned to go. "Oh by the way before I leave did I tell you how beautiful you look in that dress?" With that said he walked out of her sight.</p><p>The smile on Akane's face grew wider as she turned to go home. So giddy where her thoughts that she didn't even pay attention to the rain that started to fall. She started to hum to herself as she walked out of the park towards her home. She was so oblivious to her surroundings that she didn't even pay attention to the girl and a panda fighting in the middle of the street. After all she needed to tell her family she was getting married.</p><p>The rain was letting up as Genma fought with the girl in front of him. Why couldn't the child see that this was for his own good? True they were in an awkward position as it were. After all it isn't every day that a normal Japanese man can turn into a panda with but a splash of cold water. Not to mention a boy that will turn into a girl.</p><p>"I ain't gon'a do it pop. There is no way that I will be engaged to someone I don't even know. We shouldn't even be worrying about that in the first place." The girl said while throwing punches at the panda. "We should get back to China and find a cure." The girl said turning around. The next thing the girl saw was darkness as the panda hit her on the head with a stop sign.</p><p>The panda then through the petite figure of a girl over his shoulder. He noticed people looking at him with the girl over his shoulder in a confused bafflement. He let out a roar to each side of himself making the pedestrians watching him and the girl start on their way in a hurry to get away from the strange animal. What did he care any way?</p><p>(Soun my old friend I know you will take care of us in our time of need.) He thought as he walked along towards his friend's dojo. (If only this had not have happened then I would be able to show the boy to…) He trailed off at that thought for he had done something truly dishonorable. Was he so shallow as to make this boy go through with the promise he made with his friend. (It is a matter of family honor. He must marry one of Soun's daughters. After all he is my son.) Genma thought solemnly. His wife also knew the promise itself.</p><p>His wife, what would she think of the events that had occurred after his parting? He knew he would be a dead man. No, she could never find out about his ultimate failure. She would never forgive him. It was truly known to him how much she loved her son. The only reason she had relented in giving Ranma over to him for the training trip was in the aspiration that he could make the boy into a great man. Not only that but a man amongst men.</p><p>It was so hard though. First with his failure with that ultimate technique and the other mishap because of it. Then with the stealing and cheating. Now with the curses it would be a miracle if his wife would even let one word get out of his mouth before beheading him.</p><p>Of coarse that is if his plan didn't work. All he had to do was to get the boy married to one of Soun's daughters. Freeload as long as he could. Make sure his wife would never find them. Then his life was set. After all, the boy didn't need a mother. The boy probably didn't even know who his mother was. No, his wife could not see the boy as he had planned.</p><p>It was mere luck that he had found the agreement in the first place. Why couldn't he back it up? Soun was honorable as far as he knew. As a plus after his wife had passed away she had left him with but only three daughters. Without an heir to the dojo it could not carry on. Of coarse not that he would be able to provide that heir he would be able to live freely within Soun's protection. That would mean that his good friend would also keep him protected from those that were after him. Like that annoying amazon for instance. How were they supposed to know the food was the prize for the tournament? (Oh well it is most likely that we lost her anyway.) He thought as he continued on his way.</p><p>Soun had tiers in his eyes as he read the post card over again. Finally his friend was on his way with the son that would one day marry one of his little girls. Finally the agreement would be fulfilled and he would finally get his heir to the school.</p><p>Looking at the post card Soun thought about whom would be the most likely bride for the boy. Kasumi was the most motherly of the trio. She was sweet and kind. She had a lot of her mother in her. Except for maybe the temper that her mother would show at times towards him. However rare it was to see it was great. Kasumi did not have that. She would make a perfect wife. Yet she was already nineteen years old. Much too old for a sixteen year old boy.</p><p>Nabiki was more his age. At seventeen she was becoming every bit the woman her mother had been. Where Kasumi had gained her mother's talents for the duties of the housewife Nabiki gained her mothers looks combined with the talent for finance. It was a good trait for that of a son that was going into business yet not for a daughter. She was much too independent at times. The girl was undoubtedly very beautiful but her mannerism needed to be improved. The girl even blackmailed him not to long ago. Nabiki was one that would need a man that could control her. This match could be what she would need. Of coarse for right now her ways of making money made her happy. He always wanted to make his girls happy.</p><p>Akane was another choice in this matter. She was the same age and did share an interest in the art. However her interest went way too far. She was training like she was the one that would take over the dojo. It was of coarse the job of a male heir to take it over. Hopefully that would be his friend's son. Akane seemed to let her emotions run rampant. It was all to often that he would get in the way of the girls all too violent temper. It was his fault he knew. All the years training her even in the basic parts of the art were wrong. He should have kept her with Kasumi. That way he would have had two of his children to cook and clean for him. Plus be the housewives they should be. Yet now it seemed it was to late for Akane.</p><p>Of coarse she had mellowed in the last few months. He had heard of her fighting boys at school. It was an interesting idea. That is why he had not stopped the challenges before. The girl needed a man with initiative. She had scared him with that tale that she was seeing a boy before hand, but he knew better. After all if she had been seeing this boy he would have seen him by now. The boy was probably used to give him a jump of sorts. To make him notice her more. She really shouldn't need to though.</p><p>With the arrival of his friend's son it would be what his daughter might need to get into the housewife status that she belonged in. Both of his younger daughters in fact. As Soun thought about it more he began to realize that it might be a good idea to engage the other daughter as soon as this engagement was finalized. He would have to look into that. Of coarse he would have to tell the girls of the original engagement first. He reread the post card first going over what had made him so happy.</p><i><p>Dear Soun.</p><p>I am returning from china. Am brining Ranma.</p><p>Saotome</p></i><p>He first yelled into the kitchen where Kasumi was busy with her chores. "Kasumi!"</p><p>"Yes father?" Came her gentile reply.</p><p>"Come here Kasumi there is something I need to discus with you and your sisters."</p><p>With that said he ran up the stairs to his middle daughter's room. He opened the door to find Nabiki reading one of her magna she always had. He wondered what was in them she found so interesting? (It must be one of those romance ones?) He thought as he noticed tiers on her cheeks.</p><p>"Nabiki come down stairs there is something important I must speak to you girls about."</p><p>"What is it daddy?"</p><p>"We will soon have some guests over. I will explain as soon as I find Akane"</p><p>Soun then turned and headed for Akane's room leaving Nabiki alone to think. Especially if there was a cute boy on the way that her sisters couldn't get their hooks into.</p><p>Soun arrived at Akane's bedroom door and opened it calling her name. "Akane!" He noticed that the room was empty. He had thought sure that his daughter was in her room. "Where could that girl be?" He thought out loud as he looked around the house for his missing sixteen-year-old daughter. He ran into Nabiki coming out of her room.</p><p>"Nabiki please help me find your sister I can't think of where she could be."</p><p>"Oh, Akane is…" Nabiki started but was interrupted by someone calling from the front door.</p><p>"I'm home!" Came Akane's voice as Soun turned to the stairs and started for the living room to greet his daughter. Nabiki turned to go back in her room to get into something more presentable for their guests. She hoped one was a cute boy that she could have.</p><p>Akane had just avoided getting drenched by the rain on her way home. She couldn't believe how spaced out she had been after Kenchi had proposed to her. She had been lucky that the rain was short and did nothing more than getting her skin a little damp. Walking into the family room she was immediately ransacked by her father as he came running down the stairs. He was wearing the biggest smile she had seen on him for a long time. That smile soon turned into a look of shock as he got a good look at her.</p><p>"A…a…a…Akane w…w…wha…"</p><p>"Where was I daddy? I was on a date with Kenchi. You won't believe what happened. I have some great news daddy."</p><p>"It seems today is the day for news Akane." Nabiki said coming down the stairs in one of her dress up kimonos. "Daddy has some news for us too. Don't you daddy?"</p><p>Soun came out of the shock of seeing his daughter in such an outfit and looking like the way she did made him want to lock her up from any boy who came in hearing distance of her. Kasumi then entered the room and got a look at Akane's attire.</p><p>"Oh My! Akane you didn't go out in that did you?" Kasumi asked eyeing the dress and the way it clung to her body.</p><p>"Yes I did Kasumi." Akane said in a flat voice. Then she smiled at her family. "Kenchi really liked it to when we went out on our date."</p><p>Soun saw that Akane was again trying to gain attention to herself so he forestalled any arguing that may have started between the two sisters. "Akane I am sure the details of your date are interesting but I have some important news for the three of you. So if you would all sit down I will begin."</p><p>The three Tendo daughters did as their father had implied and sat at the dining room table. They then looked to their father on what this meeting was all about. "Well then…" He started as he sat before his three daughters. "The reason that I have gathered you all here is to inform you that one of you will be getting a fiancée today."</p><p>There was a brief pause then the cry of "Fiancee!" Came from the lips of one of his three daughters. Soun was surprised that Akane had not reacted as her sister as he believed she would be the most apprehensive on this subject.</p><p>"Yes the son of a very dear friend of mine will be arriving. His name is Ranma."</p><p>"Oh my, is he an older boy father? Young men are so young."</p><p>"Hold on Kasumi." Nabiki said getting the attention off of the boy's age. "Maybe he's cute. Well daddy what's this Ranma like?"</p><p>Soun glanced at his three daughters. Both Nabiki and Kasumi were looking at him expectantly while Akane was admiring her left hand for some reason. It was of no concern though. Soun stood and turned from the three and with a chuckle said. "I don't know. I've never met him."</p><p>"You mean you engaged one of us to someone you have never met?" Nabiki said flatly.</p><p>"Well, he is a martial artist who has been on a long ten year training journey spanning from Japan into China."</p><p>"Oooooo China." (Well traveled that's usually a good sign.) Nabiki thought as her face brightened.</p><p>"So he's been to China. Big deal so has Kenchi." (I wonder how tough this boy is? Maybe I could use that aura reading trick Kenchi taught me on him. That is if he hasn't learned to suppress his ki as Kenchi has.) Akane thought as she again gazed at her engagement ring adoringly.</p><p>All of a sudden a commotion was heard coming from the front door. With a voice yelling, "Put me down old man, I aint going through with this."</p><p>"Oh, we have guests." Kasumi said getting up to answer the door.</p><p>Nabiki was quicker though as she hurriedly got up and raced to the door saying. "Oooooo it must be Ranma."</p><p>Soun was a half a second behind his middle daughter as he to raced to the door saying. "Genma my old friend!"</p><p>"I do hope he is older than me." Kasumi said walking in the direction that her sister and father had disappeared. Akane followed behind a frown on her face.</p><p>Suddenly Nabiki and Soun came racing back around the corner. Stopping in front of Akane and Kasumi. Both very startled as they turned back towards the way they had come. The object of their fright came around the corner soon afterward. Akane's eyes grew wide as a giant panda came into sight carrying a person over its shoulder.</p><p>"Would you quit it! You're scaring them!" The person screamed unhappily.</p><p>The panda stopped right in front of them as it picked the person off of its shoulder and placed him/her on his/her feet on the floor. All four of the Tendo's stared at the person before them. The person was about the same height as Akane with short blond hair. Though he was a bit curvy to be a boy. He wore a green Chinese shirt with loose black ankle tied pants. The most noticeable feature on him was his hard green eyes. The way they looked at you, and made you feel small.</p><p>"Y…y…y…you wouldn't be…?" Soun started as he gazed at the person before him.</p><p>"Yeah I'm Ranma Saotome." He said crossing his arms over his chest and staring Soun in the eye.</p><p>"Oh he is cute." Nabiki said trying to get over her earlier surprise.</p><p>"We are so happy that you are here!" Soun cried out as he took Ranma into his hands. His joy was soon replaced by confusion as he got a good feel of the person in front of him. He knew he couldn't be feeling what he was feeling. He took Ranma at arm length and got a good look at the person in his arms. It was Nabiki who was poking at Ranma's chest who made the problem clear to all.</p><p>"Daddy Ranma's not a boy, he's a girl." She said looking at the girl's smaller chest. For even though they were small they were still noticeable.</p><p>It was too much for Soun as the room began to spin around him. Seeing the group around him as he collapsed into darkness.</p><p>Ranma was about to spout off and leave these [to him] losers when he noticed the other two girls in the room. One he didn't really care about. She was the homemaker type that he had always found to be easy. Always ready to be the subservient housewife that will try to please you every chance you get. He really didn't like those type of women since they were the ones who tried to sneak their way into controlling you the most. No, it was the girl standing right to the side of her that caught his attention. She was the epiphany of beauty to him. The yellow Chinese dress that seemed to meld to her glistening skin. Her dark long hair perfectly matching her beautiful hazel brown eyes. Eyes that shown with fire and spirit. Ranma knew in that instant that he wanted her. If it was for the honor of the family it would make it just an added bonus.</p><p>Ranma quietly followed the girls as they carried their father into the family room. Sitting at the table and admiring the view of the girl he would take as his bride.</p><p>"Poor father, he must be so disappointed." Kasumi said placing a damp cloth on her fathers' head.</p><p>"Poor father!" Nabiki, [who had changed into a T-shirt and jeans] shouted out, her anger getting to her. "How about poor us? Look at this, what a disappointment. Don't you know the difference between a boy and a girl daddy?"</p><p>"I assumed my friend Genma's son was a boy." Soun mound out weakly from the floor.</p><p>"A boy! Douse this look like a boy to you daddy? Well, douse it?" Nabiki asked as she grabbed one of Ranma's breasts.</p><p>Ranma slapped her hand away while saying. "Stop that! How would you like to be grabbed in that way?"</p><p>Akane was about to chastise her sister when Ranma had slapped her hand. Akane frowned at the girl as Nabiki rubbed her sore hand. It was wrong of Nabiki to grab the girl's breast, but it was also wrong for the girl to slap her sister's hand. That the girl was supposed to be a great martial artist was but another reason the girl should have refrained from hitting her sister. Just pushing her hand away would have been enough. Yet to slap her sister so hard was unforgivable.</p><p>"Hi, my name is Akane." Akane stated standing up and offering her hand to the blond hared girl. "I heard that you study martial arts. Would you like to spar?"</p><p>Ranma assessed the girl in front of him. She moved with grace and power. He wondered if she was any good at martial arts. (Probably not wearing that dress and all.) He thought as he nodded and stood a smirk on his face.</p><p>Akane didn't like the smirk on the girl's face as much as she liked the fact that the girl had hit her sister. Akane led her to the dojo not bothering to change out of the dress given to her by Kenchi. (Kenchi fights in his good cloths so why can't I?) She thought as she opened the dojo doors. Paying the proper respects to the shrine inside she stepped inside and waited for Ranma to enter.</p><p>Unnoticed by either Nabiki crept up to watch the match. She had been angry that the strange girl had slapped her so. No one did that to her, and got away with it. Nabiki was hoping that Akane would take out the upstart girl. (She deserves a good beating for what she did.) Thought Nabiki settling down in the shadows. The battle that Nabiki thought she was going to see was not what she saw though. She expected Akane to just rush Ranma right off the bat getting a fast knock out. Yet all Akane did was wait for Ranma to make the first move. This was very interesting to Nabiki. As far as she was concerned Akane was always the aggressor. (When did Akane become so patient?) Nabiki wondered to herself.</p><p>Ranma was growing impatient. (This girl was the one who wanted to spar. So why doesn't she attack?) He thought as he waited. He started to fidget a little as he waited. A fact that Akane took in almost instantly as she stood there as he was. All to soon Ranma made an attack striking out with a quick jab that he thought would put the girl down. His thoughts were thrown into confusion though as the girl was not where he through the punch. He barely countered the punch thrown at him as Akane started an attack of her own. Back and forth they went as Nabiki watched unable to believe the level of skill that was being displayed in the mach. Not only by the new girl Ranma but also by her sister.</p><p>(Akane has never been this good. Has Kenchi's training really improved her skills so much?) Nabiki thought as Akane and Ranma battled their way around the dojo. Ten minutes later the two separated each facing each other breathing rather hard.</p><p>"Y…y…your not half bad." Ranma breathed out as he eyed Akane.</p><p>"You're not to bad yourself." Akane said back not taking her eyes of the blond hared girl for an instant. As she had said the girl was good. Ranma was getting her hits in that was for sure. Yet Ranma didn't have the power that she herself had. Noticing the way the girl was breathing Akane thought that the girl didn't have the same endurance either. She could probably wear her down in a while yet in doing that she left herself open to a mistake. Akane recognized the girl's experience. The girl was adapting in much the same way that Kenchi was teaching her to do. (In another few minutes the girl will probably have my rhythm down. I need to win this) Akane thought as she circled Ranma.</p><p>Ranma was having thoughts of his own in this regard. (Man who knew that a chick could be that fine and is this good at martial arts.) He thought as he watched her circle. He began to pace her step for step as he watched for an opening in her defenses. (The girl may be good but she is not as good as I am. After all I am the best.) He thought as he leapt to attack Akane again.</p><p>Nabiki was shocked as the minutes flew by and no victor seemed to be in sight with the two female fighters. Back and forth they went as fists and feet flew over and over again at the two opponents. The fight itself a thing of beauty. She wished she could have sold tickets to the event itself. After thirty minutes or so Nabiki saw the two separate again. Both were extremely winded and were breathing hard. Suddenly Ranma lunged at Akane. Akane dodged the attack but the wall behind her got a noticeable hole in it. Akane was quick to retaliate and landed a well-placed punch to Ranma's gut. The two then stood looking at each other. Then the both of them fell to their knees at the same time. The both of them to exhausted to continue.</p><p>"W…w…w…what do you say we call this one a draw." Akane breathed out looking at her blond hared opponent.</p><p>"Yeah I guess it was." Ranma responded getting her breath back.</p><p>"That was incredible!" Nabiki replied from the sidelines startling the two.</p><p>"Nabiki, how long have you been there?" Akane asked as she got back to her feet.</p><p>"The whole time you two have been going at it. I had no idea how much you had improved Akane. Your sensai couldn't be that good could he?"</p><p>"He a very good martial artist and a good teacher. I'm sure if you asked him nicely that he could even teach you a few things Nabiki."</p><p>"You know I'm not into that sort of stuff sis. Besides I don't think you would give him time to train me anyway." Nabiki said with a smirk on her face observing the blush that formed on her sister's face.</p><p>Before any more could be said Kasumi's voice called from the house. "Akane, Nabiki, Ranma diner will be ready soon. Please come in and wash up first will you?"</p><p>"Well I'm going to go and take a bath first." Akane said while walking out of the dojo. Leaving Nabiki and Ranma alone together.</p><p>"Well that was interesting. Come on Ranma I'll show you your room and then you can take your bath."</p><p>"Uh…um…yeah sure why not?" Ranma said while following Nabiki out of the dojo. His thoughts occupied by the beauty of Akane. He wondered if he should just take her tonight after he changed back. Or if he should wait a few days until she had actually started to get to know him. With his girl form it was easy to get into their private lives. That is if his old man didn't screw it up like he always did. One thing was for sure though to him Akane Tendo would be his.</p><p>Akane got out of her bath and dressed quickly, as she was hungry from skipping lunch to get ready for her date with Kenchi. As she was exiting the washroom door Ranma came in surprising her.</p><p>"You're done already?" Ranma asked having a disappointed look on her face, which was a little disturbing to Akane.</p><p>"Yeah, all I needed was to clean off and a little soak. Besides dinner is almost ready. Hurry up you don't want to be late for one of Kasumi's meals." With that Akane left Ranma to her bath. On her way down the hall Akane ran into Nabiki who looked as if she was going to take a bath as well.</p><p>"Nabiki, I thought you already took a shower earlier?"</p><p>"I did but watching you and Ranma spar even got me all sweaty. So I figured as long as there's a bath ready already I might as well take one. I thought you would be in there already sis?"</p><p>"Oh, I already took mine."</p><p>"So fast? You were in there for only ten minuets sis."</p><p>"I know but I really don't need a long soak today. Besides I am hungry and want to be early to dinner."</p><p>"Ha, you know Kasumi sis. She won't serve dinner until every one is there anyway."</p><p>"Well maybe I can get a early dinner snack then since I know how long you take in the bath sis." Akane laughed out as she started past her sister. Earning a swat on her tush from her sisters' towel. "Owe!" Akane said with a smile, as the swat didn't really hurt.</p><p>"Humph well maybe I like long soaks sis." Nabiki said walking towards the bath. Akane didn't miss the smile on her face though. Akane couldn't remember when she had a day so filled with good cheer. Her thoughts grew in cheer as she proceeded to the kitchen for a snack before dinner.</p><p>Nabiki smiled on her way to the bath. It was a long time since she had seen her sister so happy. To think it was because of a boy was a testament of how love can take away most pain in a person's life. Nabiki's smile grew sad as she thought of another couple that had shown the same kind of love as her sister now was showing. She was younger then and the hurt and pain were still hard to get rid of. She had thought that a person could just seal off their emotions and then be protected from the hurt of betrayal. Like what had happened in their past. Yet seeing her sister she realized that if you closed yourself off you could never feel the pleasure either.</p><p>With a sigh Nabiki realized that she was jealous of the love her sister had received from Kenchi. She found that she wanted that love for herself. She wanted to have his gray blue eyes look into hers with the same sort of longing that she had seen for her sister. She suddenly stopped and realized that she truly did want Kenchi. She thought that she had protected herself from that sort of thing. Yet she had not for in Kenchi she had seen her sister become her happiest. For that she loved Kenchi above all ells. For she loved her sisters more than anything in the entire world did.</p><p>(Is that why I love him so much? Because he can bring such joy and happiness to my sister?) She thought as she opened the changing room door. She noticed Ranma's cloths lying in a pile off to the side. (Oh well maybe we can talk a bit.) Nabiki thought as she stripped off her cloths and undergarments.</p><p>She then opened the bathing room door to see a naked boy getting out of the bath reaching for the cold water.</p><p>They both stood in their positions for a few seconds Nabiki with a towel around her shoulders and the boy with nothing on at all. Then Nabiki calmly looked down towards the floor. Took a step back closing the bathroom door. She then put on the T-shirt she wore earlier that hung a bit past her thighs covering the most important areas. She then stepped out of the changing room closed that door. Took a breath then screamed.</p><p>Down in the family room Akane, Kasumi, Soun and another man sat looking towards the stairs. "What was that?" Asked Akane as she started to get up. All of a sudden Nabiki came running down the stairs still screaming her head off. She stopped behind Akane.</p><p>"Akane you've got to beat him to a pulp. Make him pay!" Nabiki said shoving Akane forward.</p><p>"Who?" Akane said confused by her sister's actions.</p><p>"The pervert that is in the bath of coarse. The one…" Nabiki was interrupted by a cough. The family turned to see a boy wearing the same clothes that the girl Ranma had worn on her way to the bath. He had short dark hair and stood at about a little over a foot above Akane. Just a little taller than her Kenchi in fact. He wore a scowl on his face directed towards Nabiki as the girl had done earlier when Nabiki had grabbed her breast before she had slapped Nabiki's hand away. In fact the girl's eye's looked exactly like the boys did in front of her. A suspicion formed in Akane's mind made stronger by the words the boy spoke next.</p><p>"To get this straight I am Ranma Saotome." He said crossing his arms in front of his chest. "If we could sit we might as well explain ourselves." Ranma said motioning to the man</p><p>"Let me guess Jusenkyo right?" Akane asked receiving shocked looks from those starting to sit at the table. Two because of her knowledge of the springs. The rest because of her calm disposition on the matter.</p><p>"You know of the place?" Ranma asked even more impressed by the girl next to him.</p><p>"Yes I have had some study on it. Though I haven't been there myself I know some Chinese Amazons who have." Ranma visibly cringed at the mention of the Chinese tribe. "I see you know of them." Akane said noting Ranma's reaction.</p><p>"Sort of." Ranma stated flatly.</p><p>"Well any way." Akane started turning to her family. "Jusenkyo is a valley in China filled with thousands of cursed springs. Let's see if I remember this right. Who ever falls into a spring will take the form of whomever or whatever drowned in that particular spring last when doused with cold water. But will change back to his or her original form when doused with warm or hot water. Did I get that right?"</p><p>"Um…yeah, I guess you did." Ranma said impressed by Akane's knowledge. He was a bit disappointed though that she had changed her outfit into a gi instead of the dress she was wearing earlier. Though if he had his way she wouldn't be wearing anything at all by tonight. A grin came to his face as he thought of getting Akane into some interesting positions.</p><p>"What are you smiling about pervert?" Nabiki asked eyeing Ranma with a suspicious look. She didn't like the boy one bit. She especially didn't like the look he was giving her sister.</p><p>"Hmm how to explain about us?" The older bald headed man with glasses wearing a white gi and a bandanna covering his baldhead started. "Oh I know." He picked up Ranma and through him in the pond.</p><p>"Stupid old man why did you do that!" Ranma shouted as he climbed out of the pond now the female blond the others had seen before.</p><p>"Now…he's a girl." Kasumi stated eyeing the blond as she stared at the girl sitting in the pond.</p><p>"Oh the humiliation that a father must suffer. Such a disappointment you have become to your father boy."</p><p>"Your one to talk old man." Ranma stated as he dumped a bucket full of pond water on his father. The two began to fight in the back yard as the Tendo's looked on.</p><p>"You have some interesting friends father." Kasumi stated as she walked up behind her father. Who was watching the two Saotome men fight. Though the both of the Saotome's did not look like the men they were at that time.</p><p>"They were not always like this. Not since that fateful trip to China. Let them come back to themselves and then we will let them explain shall we?" Soun said as he continued to watch the two fight.</p><p>Later the group was again seated at the table each family staring at the other. It was Genma now male who broke the silence. "Two months ago Ranma and I swam to China. While there we visited many areas meant for the improvement of martial arts training. At first the training grounds seemed somewhat disappointing. Then I heard of a place that only the greatest of martial artists could go and train."</p><p>"Jusenkyo right?" Akane said in a board tone.</p><p>"Yes that is exactly right. It was about a week after we had arrived in China."</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Here sirs we arrive at Jusenkyo. Valley of very cursed spring." A man wearing a communist uniform said.</p><p>"This is it?" Ranma asked as he surveyed the area. "This place isn't as bad as I thought it would be."</p><p>"Come on Ranma follow me." Genma said as he jumped up onto a pole.</p><p>"Right pop!" Ranma said as he followed his father.</p><p>"Sirs what you doing. I no' have finished my very tragic story." The guide said as he tried to stop the two.</p><p>The two martial artist in question ignored him though as they began to fight across the pole tops. Father and son continued to through punches and kicks at each other seeming to dance across the poles. At each leap seeming to hang suspended in mid air and then landing on an opposite pole safely unharmed. Then suddenly Ranma got a lucky hit in. Sending Genma straight for a spring. Ranma waited for his father to surface with a smile on his face saying.</p><p>"Hey loser you done already?" The smile on his face disappeared as he saw a panda come out of the water landing on a pole opposite from himself in a battle stance. "Hey what's going on here?" Ranma shouted down to the guide.</p><p>"Oh that one fall into spring of drowned panda. Very tragic story of panda who drown in spring six hundred year ago."</p><p>"You never said anything about this." Ranma shouted as he pointed towards the panda.</p><p>The panda, taking note of Ranma's distraction attacked knocking Ranma off his pole into another spring. Surfacing the boy now turned girl looked inside her gi top and found two parts of her anatomy that were not there a moment before and screamed.</p><p>The guide came up to the side of the spring shaking his head. "Oh so sorry sir. You fall in to spring of drowned girl. Very tragic story of girl who drown in spring one thousand five hundred year ago."</p><p>As the memory faded and Genma's words died out Ranma found himself shaking with anger. Soun's next words just helped to fuel that anger.</p><p>"Ah the legendary springs of Jusenkyo. Its true horror finally revealed."</p><p>"True horror!" Ranma shouted as he stood up and grabbed his father by the lapels of his gi top. "What do you mean true horror! How could have taken me to a place like that in the first place old man!"<br/>Ranma found himself being thrown into the pond again. "You sound like a girl Ranma. Were you not prepared to give your life in pursuit of the art?"</p><p>"My life yes, my manhood is a different story." Ranma said as he splashed a pail of water on his father. The panda growled at his son turned girl and prepared to throw a punch at him. He was stopped however as scolding hot water was being poured on him.</p><p>"So hot water will turn you back to normal?" Soun asked as the panda turned back into a man.</p><p>"The water needn't be that hot." Genma said cringing in pain.</p><p>"Cold water turns you into a girl." Soun said pointing at Ranma. Then trying to pour the scolding hot water on Ranma he said. "While hot water changes you back into a boy."</p><p>"Hot water not BOILING!" Ranma shouted out as she dodged the scolding hot water.</p><p>"Well then son." Soun said while putting his arms around Ranma's shoulders, and turning him towards the seated girls. "Your problems not so bad after all."</p><p>"Yeah right." Ranma said sarcastically.</p><p>"My daughters…" Soun continued not paying attention to Ranma's words. "Kasumi age 19, Nabiki age 17, and Akane age 16. Choose which one you want and she will be your bride."</p><p>"Oh he chooses Akane." Kasumi said before Ranma could utter a word.</p><p>"Yes, he defiantly wants Akane." Nabiki said backing her sister up.</p><p>"What? Why me?" Akane asked shocked by her two sisters. That they would try to foist Ranma off on her. Especially when they knew how she felt about Kenchi.</p><p>"Well you are the same age." Started Kasumi in her innocent voice.</p><p>"And we know how you hate boys. Added Nabiki as she started to back up her sister.</p><p>"Well you're in luck Akane, Ranma's half girl." Finished Kasumi.</p><p>"Well then it's decided Akane will…" Soun started but was cut off.</p><p>"Hold it! First off I do not hate all boys Nabiki, or have you forgotten about Kenchi? Speaking of Kenchi, have you all forgotten that I was dating him?"</p><p>"Well this is more a matter of honor Akane. Would you truly turn your back on that? Asked Kasumi as she desperately tried to regain a foothold.</p><p>"The promise said that Ranma would marry one of the Tendo daughters. So it douse not have to be me. Besides I already have a fiancée. Kenchi asked me this afternoon." Akane said as she showed the room the ring on her finger.</p><p>The roof of the Tendo home rose ten feet in the air as three shouts of "WHAT!" came through the room. Three surprised faces stared at Akane and the ring on her finger. Nabiki took Akane's hand and examined the ring closer. She was surprised at the quality of the ring. In the time she had seen Kenchi he had seemed plain. The ring on Akane's finger though would set her family back to being paupers. It was beautiful. A gold band with a diamond mounted in the center. The diamond seemed to explode outwards where other smaller diamonds surrounded it. Like the planets that surrounded the sun. embroidered in the ring were the images of a dragon and a phoenix coming from opposite sides to fly into the jewels. It was a very lovely ring a ring that Nabiki thought should be on her finger. Not the finger of her younger sister.</p><p>Kasumi was in shock. She didn't expect that her little sister would go and get herself engaged. She was supposed to hate boys. Not like them so much she would agree to marry one. Least of all not one she hadn't met yet.</p><p>Soun's head was in a spin. His youngest daughter had said she was engaged to another boy. A boy he had never met. A boy that he had thought was a figment of his young daughter's imagination. Yet there on her finger lay the ring that spoke of her engagement. An engagement he didn't feel was right. After all he had doubts about his other two daughters. Kasumi and Nabiki would not be the ideal choices to continue the school. That left Akane. Through Akane an heir could be made. An heir to the school for the Tendo family. He himself had no sons to continue the school for him. Only daughters. A girl could not take the place of a man no matter how she tried. He knew this. Unfortunately his wife had died before she could sire him any sons. His hope now lay in the hands of his friend. Having Ranma enter the family and though not an heir by blood he would still carry on the school. Yet he needed to marry the one that the school was offered to. That was Akane.</p><p>Since his daughter had been so good at it Soun had decided to teach her a bit of the art. She had entered the world of a martial artist with relish. Going as far as she could to be the best. Soun found himself getting angry at the prospect of his daughter's engagement to someone unknown to him. He was the head of the household after all. It was his say weather his daughter should marry or not. He should be the one that made the choice of weather his daughter should be with a boy or not. Soun opened his mouth to say as much, yet before he could utter a word his other two daughters spoke.</p><p>"Kenchi gave you that!" Nabiki all but shouted her shock at seeing such a ring on her sister's finger still evident on her face.</p><p>"Oh my, Akane wouldn't it have been more proper for the family to meet this boy first. You haven't done anything with him have you? Your not pregnant I hope?" At that statement from his daughter Soun almost fainted.</p><p>"Kasumi! How can you ask such a thing? Better yet how can you think such a thing of me? First of all Kenchi is coming over tomorrow afternoon after school so you will be able to meet him then. As for me being pregnant. Of coarse I'm not pregnant. You know I'm saving myself for the man I will marry. Kenchi and I just got engaged and he believes in marriage first. It's one of the traits I love about him. He is also very honorable and lives by the code of a martial artist. He would never hurt me, or do anything to me unless I wanted him to."</p><p>"Boy this guy sure seems like a wimp." Stated Ranma looking to the entire world as if he would fall asleep. His thoughts though were on a different matter. He couldn't believe that the girl he wanted to seduce was engaged. It usually made things a bit harder to get a girl in the sac if she had someone already. He would have to be careful. After all a mob of angry boyfriends or angry fathers was nothing to shake a stick at. It would be easier if he had the engagement to back him up. Still tonight the girl would loose her virtue to him. That he would make sure of. It would make sure that the girl was his. After all even that one prude of a girl had given in to him though it took some forcing.</p><p>"Kenchi could whip your butt from hear back to China. You should watch who you call a wimp Ranma." Akane said scowling at Ranma for his statement.</p><p>"Care to make a wager on that?" Ranma said sensing an opportunity.</p><p>"What sort of wager?" Akane asked eyeing the boy suspiciously. Right now she didn't trust him one bit.</p><p>"Well I don't need money or any other currency at the moment, and I have all the worldly possessions I need. I would also like something extremely valuable to you so as to say I won the fight with gusto. I know if I win you will have to give up your virtue to me." Ranma said smiling lecherously at Akane.</p><p>"What! No way! I would never do something like that. You must be crazy to ask me to give up my virginity over a fight!" Akane said glaring daggers at Ranma.</p><p>"Oh so you don't have that much confidence in your fiancee after all then? You wouldn't be willing to risk it all because you know he is going to lose." Ranma said the smile on his face growing wider.</p><p>Akane knew what the boy was doing. Many of the other boys she knew like Kuno did much the same thing. The only difference between them and Ranma was that Ranma was openly gesturing what he wanted from her. Kenchi has warned her about boys like him. Not that she had already known. After all she did have to deal with Kuno a lot. The other population of Furincan High School boy's chapter seemed to be the same as Kuno in fact. Often she had heard their snide remarks about her. They would speak about how they had wanted to get her alone behind a building or in a room drunk. The only one who had truly gotten past that was Kenchi.</p><p>Kenchi had a unique perspective on a woman's point of view though. He had been raised by women most of his life. He even lived as one part of his life though he preferred to be a boy. Unlike the pervert in front of her Kenchi was a real man. She knew Kenchi could wipe the floor with this upstart. Yet she wondered if Kenchi would be mad at her for again getting him in a fight. He had told her before how he truly hated to fight. Yet if something she could not handle came up he would be there by her side in an instant.</p><p>Akane's thoughts on the subject were brought to a halt as her father spoke up. "Hmm…I think the boy has a point. Your <i>fiancee </i>should be able to defend your honor if he is so good. However if he should lose you will be married to Ranma. Therefor having your virtue taken would not be dishonorable.</p><p>At his statement Soun's three daughters looked at him with complete shock on their faces. They couldn't believe he would say something like that. Each of his daughters held their chastity in the highest order. For their father to just flaunt just one of the threes virtue was despicable.</p><p>"How can you say that daddy! Akane shouted getting to her feet.</p><p>"Daddy that wouldn't very be very smart." Nabiki said glaring at her father.</p><p>"Father that wouldn't be proper at all. What would mother think?" Kasumi said a shocked look on her face.</p><p>"B…b…b…b…but I…" Soun started to bluber from receiving the hostile looks from his three daughters.</p><p>"Tendo do not worry. After all it would seem that your daughter will not stick by the code of a martial artist and the code of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. Your daughter douse not seem to be up to the challenge." Genma said looking like a poor imitation to a wise sensai.</p><p>"Fine, <i>IF</i> Kenchi loses I will give up my virtue to you." Akane said looking at Ranma. Then she got a thoughtful look on her face. "However what if Kenchi were to win the fight what would you give up to us?" Akane asked a wicked smile coming to her face.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Ranma asked getting a worried look on his face.</p><p>"Well if Kenchi loses I will have to give up my maiden hood before I am ready. I will also have to marry someone I don't want to. What would you have to do of equal importance if Kenchi wins?" Akane asked, however before he could answer she continued. "I know if you lose you will have to give up all rights to this dojo and of the engagement. You will also have to promise on your word of honor that you will never come on to my sisters or myself in a sexual manner unless given freely. Or you will commit ritual suicide right in front of this family."</p><p>"Fine you're on." Ranma said with a confident smirk on his face. He held the smirk until his father grabbed him by his shirt and dragged him out into the dojo. Unnoticed by the two Nabiki followed wanting to hear what the two would talk about. Leaving Akane and Kasumi to deal with their father.</p><p>Later the three sisters found themselves in Akane's room talking about the events of earlier. Particularly the little wager that was made.</p><p>"I can't believe that pervert." Nabiki stated as she did her leg lifts. "Do you know what he said when he went to talk to his father? I just can't believe father would push us off on someone like him."</p><p>"So what was said Nabiki?" Akane asked getting annoyed with her sisters ranting.</p><p>"Well first off his father started to yell at him saying he was ruining a good thing by giving in to your conditions sis. His father then went on about how this place would be the only place that they would be able to stay safely for a while. Ranma then came back and said that it wasn't a problem. That even if he lost the wager by tonight it would be to late to do anything anyway."</p><p>"In other words Ranma has something planed for one of us. Oh my." Kasumi said getting a worried look on her face.</p><p>"The pervert is going to probably go after me. He did seem to want to get me in the sac from the get go the way he was staring at me all evening long. I hope Kenchi makes him suffer tomorrow. He deserves it for what he is trying to pull. Trying to force me to have sex with him ewe." Akane said trying not to shake with the thought of being forced to do things with Ranma she would rather do with Kenchi.</p><p>"Do you really think Kenchi can take Ranma sis? After all Ranma douse seem to be awfully good. The only one I've seen Kenchi fight is Kuno and he only hits Kuno with the most simple of moves as it is. The fact that Kuno will not improve and is an idiot in the first place doesn't help. Can Kenchi take a real challenge though? Nabiki asked looking at her sister seriously. "Or better yet will he fight? After all I have done to rile the boy it seems that he still will not take a challenge."</p><p>"That's because the challenges you set up for your schemes are stupid little challenges not even worth his time Nabiki. This however is an attack on our family honor. His fiancee is about to be taken from him. Our father wants Ranma to be my husband and will allow Ranma to take my virtue in the process. You know how he feels. He wants you and I to be exact copies of Kasumi. I'm sorry to say this Kasumi but I can't live like that. I know I'm a tomboy and have little to no homemaking skills yet it's who I am. That was the girl that Kenchi fell in love with and asked to marry. He didn't ask you or Kasumi Nabiki but me. Plane old tomboy Akane. I love him so much because he sees me. Not the girl that is seen to all the others as a virginal conquest but me Akane Tendo. The first time we even met he was the only one to be there for me. He is not one to fight for the honor of being the best. He hates that, he will however fight for friends and loved ones. He is a true warrior and will always give help when help is needed."</p><p>"Father just wants us to be like mother Akane." Kasumi stated looking down at her lap.</p><p>"No he doesn't Kasumi. He wants Nabiki and I to be like you. I know you try to act like her Kasumi. You had to actually take her place for Nabiki and I when she died. Yet if you remember mom had her own way. Mom wasn't always nice and sweet. You remember that one time that daddy tried to make her do something she hated. She would always put him in his place. Remember that one time he had to sleep out in the yard because he made mom so mad. You know mom would never stand for something like this. She may have gone along with it partially for the sake of honor but she would not let Ranma bed us like he wants to from the get go. She would have kicked him out the moment he offered such a wager. Of coarse with daddies' support we couldn't do that. "Akane said looking at her older sister sadly.</p><p>"I just want to make father proud of me. I want him to be happy like when mother was alive."</p><p>"At the cost of your own happiness sis. Akane is right you have given up too much to take care of us. We are big girls and can take care of ourselves. You should already be off getting your degree to become a doctor. You have always had the potential. It's one of the things mom saw in you Kasumi. We've held you back too much from your true calling. So has daddy in a way. He sees the place of a woman as in the house to cook, clean, and make babies. I see you sometimes sis when you think you are alone. All the times you start to cry because of the life you've given up." Nabiki said looking down at her lap. "Sis, you more than anyone deserve better."</p><p>"But who would take care of the both of you. What about father he needs me to help him. After mother died he was such a wreck."</p><p>"Sis daddy took care of himself long before mother came along. As for us well I'm practically married to Kenchi and if anyone is more independent than anyone in this family it's Nabiki." Akane said giving her sister a hug.</p><p>"We can take care of ourselves sis. We can even take care of this Ranma problem. We all deserve the right to be happy. Ranma is one of the things that will have to go in order to allow us to be happy. I can see that in every minute we spend with him. I just wish we had more protection for tonight. If he has any honor at all then by tomorrow we should be all right. Yet he is going to try something tonight and that has me worried." Nabiki stated looking directly at her sisters.</p><p>"Well there is something we could do that would cause Ranma a lot of problems in accomplishing his mission. A couple of things actually." Akane said with a smile on her face.</p><p>"On and what's that sis?" Nabiki said eyeing her sister.</p><p>"Oh my Akane you have that devious look you get when you are going to try something improper."</p><p>"Oh this isn't improper Kasumi. Not by a long shot. You see all we have to do first of all is…</p><p>Ranma was in a bad mood. He grumbled as he made his way to the bath from his recent soak in the koi pond. He hated that his father would always seem to turn him into a girl to rile him. What surprised Ranma was that his father was able to grab him to even throw him in the first place. Ranma knew he was better than his father was. He had been readily able to beat his father since he was twelve. Yet for some reason his father had been able to get lucky shots in.</p><p>Ranma knew his father probably cheated somehow yet he couldn't see how. It was a mystery. One that Ranma would like to get out in the open. First he would rather be a boy though. Ranma opened the door to the changing room, entered, stripped his clothing, entered the bathroom, washed his female body with cold water, and then turned on the hot water to change. To Ranma's surprise the water was still cold when he splashed it on himself. Ranma screamed and ran out of the bath yelling.</p><p>"What's wrong with the hot water?"</p><p>"Oh my Ranma there is no need to shout. The hot water heater is broken that's all. Even the gas is out. Isn't that strange? I guess there will be no hot water tonight for you tonight." Kasumi said with on of her smiles on her face.</p><p>"What do you mean no hot water. I demand you get me hot water immediately woman!" Ranma said grabbing Kasumi's wrist. Causing her to yelp out in surprise and pain.</p><p>"Just what do you think you are doing to my sister?" Came Akane's voice from behind Ranma. Ranma turned to see Akane yellow pajamas with cats all over them looking at him angrily. He turned and saw that with him holding Kasumi's wrist like he was. Along with the painful expression on her face that things did not look good.</p><p>"Well she won't get me hot water." Ranma said, as that was the reasoning behind causing Kasumi pain. The next thing that Ranma knew he was on a one way trip via angry Akane Airlines down the stairs and through the wall back in the koi pond. All the time wondering where Akane got that mallet. His thoughts remained so until he passed out. From the blow to the head he had received.</p><p>Ranma's father picked him or her up out of the koi pond shaking his head at the sight of his son loosing to a girl in such a way. When the boy turned girl awoke he would have to make sure the boy understood the importance of not being beaten by a girl. It was disgraceful in itself that Ranma would be beaten in such a way. In either form. He had been on a training trip for ten years after all. How could this girl be so good learning from her father? Genma knew Soun and he would never teach his daughter to be so good. The girl was a lot like her mother in fact. To independent to the point of frustration. Genma remembered one time he had been visiting his friend and his friend's wife had kicked him out of the dojo for an insult of some sort. The woman was incorrigible too head strong. He had wondered why the woman stayed at home in the first place.</p><p>It was her influence that tainted Nodoka. Nodoka was never so difficult until she met Soun's wife. That is when things had started to go wrong between them. Nodoka had wanted too much. She had started to get ideas in her head. After their son was born it had become worse. Not only had she started to pamper their son, she had started to teach him ideas that would have ruined the boy. So he had taken the boy away from her. It was hard but he had succeeded. The contract he and his son had signed was the cork in the bottle. She had not been able to stop him after that.</p><p>But how could he show her this boy. This boy that turned into a girl. That could be equaled to a girl who just trained at home by a father that did not teach much. It was just disgraceful. Maybe if he had not lost… Genma stopped that line of thought as soon as it entered his head. He could not gain back what he had lost. He would just have to move forward with what he had. Like he had always done before. Like he would continue to do.</p><p>The End</p><p>Of this chapter only don't have a heart attack sheesh.</p>
