</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 21</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Ranko woke up feeling a lump next to her in the bed. It was too big to be Kero but she had no idea what it could be. Sitting up, the blanket covering her pulled up causing the lump to tumble off of the bed.</p><p>"Ouch…" A fluffy white cat moaned from where it just impacted with the floor. "That hurt you know."</p><p>"B-Bast…is that you?" Ranko asked in shock, drawing Kero awake from his bed in the dresser door.</p><p>"That's me…" the cat moaned, stretching. "That smarts."</p><p>"Who's that?" Kero asked, floating over to the two.</p><p>"I'm the Goddess Bast," Bast said, "I decided to take a cat form so I could stay near Ranko."</p><p>"I thought you went with Xellos last night." Ranko said.</p><p>"I did." Bast purred, "Which reminds me, I need to pick up some whip cream for tonight."</p><p>"Are you going to make a pie or something?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"No, dear, something far more different." Bast purred.</p><p>"Cool." Ranko said as she got out of her bed and stretched. "So you are going to be making one of those desert things with the Jell-O?"</p><p>"Let's forget about that, Ranko." Kero said while glaring at the cat, "Believe me, you don't want to know. Besides, you have two appointments to get ready for today."</p><p>"I almost forgot." Ranko said. First she had a doctor appointment and then she had to meet Tatewaki at the psychologist for that appointment. She really didn't want to go to either today since she actually agreed to go out with Bakura this evening.</p><p>A date with Bakura, that was something she wasn't sure she was really ready for. She really didn't know a whole lot about the guy after she thought about it but she felt so safe and comfortable in his arms the previous night. She admitted she was attracted to him but she wasn't really too sure what really happened on dates. She knew she really didn't want to go too far with him or anybody. In fact, the thought of being with anyone physically always changed into an image of Genma hurting her.</p><p>Getting to know Bakura was a good thing though which she was hoping to do on this date and she was sure that if he wanted a kiss goodnight that she could at least do that much. Kasumi had stayed up for awhile the previous night with Ranko talking about Bakura and what Ranko would wear. In the end Kasumi had talked Ranko into letting her shop for a dress for Ranko during the doctor appointments since Bakura said it would be a formal dinner.</p><p>"So Ranko, are you planning anything special with Bakura tonight?" Bast purred. "Maybe you should wear something a little revealing."</p><p>"Kasumi said that she would shop for me today since I have appointments all morning." Ranko said. That was the last thing she wanted to wear though, anything too revealing. It made her feel dirty just thinking about all the looks she would get and was worried about Bakura's reaction.</p><p>That of course is something that confused her very much though. She wanted to look stunning for Bakura for their date. She wanted his approval and for him to like her but she was also scared. She didn't want to show off her body to him or anyone else. She was partly ashamed of her body and hated it.</p><p>"Look, whoever you are, leave Ranko alone." Kero growled, "She doesn't need this."</p><p>"A stuffed toy should know its place." Bast said.</p><p>"Why you…" Kero growled.</p><p>"Please, just stop it!" Ranko cried, "Bast, I'm not interested in anything like that right ?" Ranko picked up some clothes and left the room quickly.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>"Now look what you done!" Kero growled.</p><p>"I'm sorry." Bast said, hanging her head down low.</p><p>"Do you have any idea what her father did to her!" Kero demanded.</p><p>"Yes…I seen it in her mind…She was thinking about Bakura kissing her and then…her father replaced him and was hurting her." Bast said, tears leaking from her eyes. "I was only trying to get her to think of Bakura…if she can stop thinking of her father every time being intimate with someone crosses her mind, it'd help her a lot."</p><p>"Look, I don't know if you're a Goddess or what you are," Kero said, "But if you hurt Ranko, I swear I'll hurt you."</p><p>"I would never hurt my daughter, Kero." Bast said, "I love her, all of my children and only want what's best for them."</p><p>"Daughter?" Kero asked</p><p>"Yes, all of my avatars are my children, my daughters." Bast said. "I do have a serious side, you know."</p><p>"I'm sorry I guess…" Kero said.</p><p>"Good, then we can go out for some ice cream!" Bast said with a huge smile, at least the biggest smile her cat form could manage.</p><p>"What?" Kero demanded.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Ranko sat in the hot water of the tub letting the heat ease the tensions in her body. She could feel Bast in her head and felt how sorry the Goddess was for upsetting Ranko as Bast was only trying to help in her own weird way.</p><p>Did she really want to be that way with any one, with Bakura? She didn't really know, the thought of that made her feel so dirty…like when Genma forced her. She was beginning to have second thoughts about the date now. Why would Bakura want someone like her when he could have a Goddess who seemed more than eager to do anything for him</p><p>"Ranko, honey." Nodoka called from the door, "Are you about done, we need to leave soon."</p><p>"Coming mom." Ranko called back as she wiped her eyes and climbed out of the tub to dry off and get ready for the day's trials.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>"You actually got a date with Ranko?" Cologne asked, shock evident in the old woman's voice.</p><p>"Yeah, so what?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"It's just…weird." Cologne said, shaking her head.</p><p>"Why is that weird?" Bakura asked, his anger rising at this woman. The crone better not be badmouthing his Kitten or she would suffer greatly.</p><p>"I guess I still think of her as Ranma sometimes, but knowing about what happened to her I can understand why she was so uncomfortable with any physical contact." Cologne said.</p><p>"She is a sweet girl, Cologne." Bakura said, "How could anyone even think of hurting her, especially her own father?"</p><p>"Sometimes child, things happen and there are no explanations that would make any sense." Cologne said.</p><p>"You do realize I am technically older than do, do you not?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"Not physically, child." Cologne laughed causing Bakura to grumble. "So where are you taking young Ranko?"</p><p>"First we are going to eat at that new Italian restaurant and then take a carriage ride through the park before I drop her off at home." Bakura said.</p><p>"Sounds like you have a nice evening all planned out, child." Cologne said.</p><p>"Hi, you must be Bakura." A boy in long white Chinese robes said with a thick pair of glasses on.</p><p>"Yeah." Bakura said, "And you?"</p><p>"I'm Mousse." Mousse said, "So who's the lucky girl?"</p><p>"My Kitten." Bakura said with a smile.</p><p>"K-Kitten?" Mousse growled, "You better not be talking about my Shampoo!"</p><p>"Relax you dolt," Cologne said cracking Mousse with her staff, "The kitten young Bakura speaks of is not Shampoo but Ranko."</p><p>"You're taking Ranko out on a date?" Mousse asked and with Bakura's nod a long thin blade slid free of Mousse's sleeve and stop just shy of Bakura's throat, "You hurt her and I'll personally carve you into little pieces."</p><p>"Mousse, what you doing?" A girl asked slapping Mousse on the back of his head, "No threaten guests. Besides, is Ranko's choice who to go out with, not yours."</p><p>"I'm only trying to protect Ranko, Shampoo." Mousse said, withdrawing the blade.</p><p>Bakura watched the interaction between the two curiously. It seemed the boy was infatuated with the girl who seemed so angry until Mousse said he was only trying to protect then her face softened.</p><p>"You two go get the kitchen ready while I finish my chat with Bakura here." Cologne demanded.</p><p>"Yes great grandmother." Shampoo said.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Ranko sat in the chair uncomfortably as noon was approaching faster than she liked. She had already seen both the doctor and the psychiatrist and was only waiting for Tatewaki to finish his session with the counselor.</p><p>The doctor appointment was something she didn't want to repeat for awhile but she did have to admit she was glad that she went. She had no diseases at all nor was she pregnant which both greatly relieved her. She still had to come back in a few weeks for a few more tests but the doctor said that she was confident that there was nothing wrong.</p><p>The shrink though, that is what bothered her more. She hated the session with him while he kept asking stupid questions and made her recount the entire thing until she couldn't take it and broke down crying. The jerk then just sat there saying to cry it all out then had the nerve to try and make her continue. If not for Tatewaki and her mother, she would have got up and left.</p><p>"Hi dear." Nodoka said as she sat down next to Ranko, "Sorry I'm back late, an old friend called on my cell while I was waiting in line and got distracted for a few moments. I might have a couple friends coming in a few weeks to visit for a couple days."</p><p>"Its no big mom." Ranko said taking the bag of food Nodoka handed her and pulled out the small side salad and ice water she wanted. Taking a bite of the salad she said, "Mom…I wanted to tell you something…"</p><p>"Yes dear?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Well…there's this boy that asked me out tonight and I said yes." Ranko said, "I was thinking about canceling but…I can't do that to him."</p><p>"Ranko, if you don't think you're ready then you don't have to." Nodoka said, "You don't have to do anything you don't want."</p><p>"I do want to mom but I don't want to." Ranko sighed, "I decided to go though, I kind of like him and…"</p><p>"Its okay, sweetie." Nodoka said, "I want you to be happy and if you think this boy can make you happy then I'll support you in any way."</p><p>"Thanks mom." Ranko said.</p><p>"You are very welcome dear." Nodoka said.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>Nodoka was getting very worried as she looked out the window upstairs and sighed in relief when she saw the two horse carriage coming down the street. She could see her daughter and the boy she had gone out with. The carriage stopped long enough for the two teens to get off.</p><p>She watched as Ranko and Bakura walked up the path to the door, hand in hand. She could tell that her daughter was happy and that made Nodoka very happy. She smiled as Ranko slowly turned around to say something, probably good night or something. Slowly the two got closer and even more slowly their lips came to meet as they kissed.</p><p>At first Nodoka thought it was very sweet until she noticed something was wrong. Ranko pushed Bakura away and crumpled to the ground. Nodoka ran down the stairs and outside to find Ranko curled up into a ball on the ground sobbing. "Please daddy…stop…STOP IT!"</p><p>"Ranko, please, what's wrong?" Bakura was asking trying to get close but every time he did Ranko cried louder.</p><p>"Its okay, Bakura." Nodoka said as she knelt to take her daughter in her arms.</p><p>"Sh-She just freaked out." Bakura said.</p><p>"She'll be okay, Bakura." Nodoka said. "It wasn't your fault. She's having a flashback."</p><p>"I'm sorry." Bakura said, worry filling his voice.</p><p>"It's okay, but you should head home for the night." Nodoka said, "Maybe come by tomorrow if you want."</p><p>"Okay." Bakura said as he turned and left though Nodoka could see he didn't want to and was very much saddened to do it.</p><p>Nodoka was mad at the boy at first, when she saw what was happening upstairs a part of her was afraid Bakura did something. When she heard Ranko crying and what she was saying Nodoka realized that it was what Nabiki had warned her about, Ranko was having a flashback to what Genma had done to her. Ranko was locked in a type of nightmare.</p><p>Nodoka finally got Ranko to settle down which greatly relieved her. Tonight she wanted to make sure Ranko was okay but tomorrow she wanted to talk to Nabiki some more about this and find out why the girl would know so much about it. The way Nabiki operated in the past gave Nodoka suspicions about what may have happened and she was hoping that they were wrong.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, hope this chapter turned out okay. Between the interruptions and with my thinking about my ex-stepfather (my new step father is great and is more of a father than either my real one or my ex step father) I had a hard time concentrating on it. Also with the days ticking by before school starts again…(cries). My leg is feeling great though and should be better before school starts (yeah, not until school starts…pouts). Oh well, no more riding on motorcycles for me…I've learned my lesson on that. I'm hoping to have this part of this story done before school starts and once it does I may only get a chapter done every two, three days max when I work on the sequel and prequel.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Den Scurman:</b> Until my leg is completely healed and school starts back up, I have no real schedule I guess. Xellos is another of my fave character from a very good anime, Slayers. I'm glad you liked the reactions with everyone and Xellos is going to be about as far from Ranma as you can get which is going to be fun in the sequel when things are much lighter. And Happi will be facing someone who could very easily send him into LEO. As soon as I'm finished with this part of the story I'm going to take a few days break and read some stories so I'll be sure to check yours out.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> That's a great idea with Nabiki, thanks. And dragon slave will be one of the spells Ranko learns for sure as well as a few other good ones. Thanks, Bast is going to become a cross between a mother and mischief maker. Id love to see a pic of Nodoka and Bast doing that with a younger Ranko, it'd be so cute. I'm not sure about a Ryou pairing with Ranko since he knows that Bakura likes her so much already. And thanks, another great idea which may happen with Ryoga and Bakura.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz: </b>Thanks, and there might be a few more slayers showing up in the sequel, it'd make things interesting. So many costume ideas for Tomoyo, Sakura and Nabiki to torture Ranko with. That's okay and thanks, I will.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> Yep, but sorry, I meant that the others like Shabrinigo and the lord of nightmares are still around to draw power for spells such as the Giga Slave and such. The slayers cast though could make an appearance in the sequel though, I'm not sure yet. I can't get the picture of Kodachi as Naga, they just seem so much alike.</p><p><b>Darkepyon:</b> Thanks, a lot of people seem to be liking it and I have to admit I am to though its not really set yet.</p><p><b>TheCentauress:</b> I love the image that brings up, poor Xellos. Ranko could very well become strong enough to rival even Lina or Naga. I pitty anyone who messes with her when she builds her confidence up a little more.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> I'm glad you like Bast, I wanted a more human looking Bast but also still a catgirl bast. I also wanted to make her mischievous. Your welcome about writing that and thank you. Slayers is a new addition to the mix and believe me both the manga and anime are great. Thanks, Ukyo Ryoga pairing may happen. Thanks and there will be plenty of chaos to go around when things settle down after the clow judgement.</p><p><b>Striker 1346:</b> He might not but he is a perverted lecher so may push his luck a little. He does have his good points and at times he does look like a saint compared to Genma.</p><p><b>I:</b> Its no big, but I'm sorry I doubt Ranko will be with all three. As for Hinako, I changed some minor timeline issues and made both Konatsu and Hinako appear earlier so Konatsu and Hinako are both already in the story though they haven't really played any major roles yet.</p><p><b>Lov3the3vil:</b> Thanks, and so far it looks like Bakura is winning though its not completely set yet.</p><p><b>Borg rabbit:</b> That's a great idea and yet a very disturbing one, thanks.</p><p><b>Darkman v3:</b> Sorry, for the moment it doesn't look like it will be happening though in the sequel there are always possibilities.</p><p><b>Maximara:</b> Thanks for the info, I never knew that about Kami. And thanks for the Bakura info as well.</p><p><b>Firehedgehog:</b> There are so many possibilities…Mew Mew Ranko comes to mind, thanks.</p><p><b>Shinigami:</b> Your welcome, I hope I get some good fanart in to put up though I will be trying to make some of my own to put up as well. (My drawing is so not good). As for Xellos, he will be regaining his true body as he regains more and more of his soul and powers. He didn't show up in this chapter because he won't be staying with Ranko for the moment because he went to check a few things but will be back next chapter or two. And Xellos will find true love, maybe a certain Goddess. And good point with Akane, I know many guys are perverted and can be scum but not all of them.</p><p>Thank you everyone,</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
