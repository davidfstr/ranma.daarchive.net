</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 26</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the characters in each.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Sakura slowly rolled along on her blades next to Akane as she asked the girl to take a walk with her while Nabiki and Ranko sunbathed. Too say that she was upset would be an understatement about what she heard about Akane and Ranko.</p><p>"Akane…I wanted to talk to you alone…about your treatment of Ranko." Sakura said, clenching and unclenching her fist.</p><p>"What about?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Is it true that you used to beat on Ranko?" Sakura asked.</p><p>"NO…I never…I…I hit Ranma…I didn't know he was a girl…Ranma…I thought he was a pervert." Akane sputtered.</p><p>"What is the difference, Akane?" Sakura asked.</p><p>"Ranma…he acted so much like a pervert." Akane said.</p><p>"That's not what I asked, Akane." Sakura said, "I asked, what is the difference? You had no right going around hitting someone like that, you could have killed someone with something like that."</p><p>"What business is it of yours!" Akane growled, stopping to glare at Sakura who also stopped to glare back.</p><p>"It's my business when it includes my friends and family, I want you to be included in that but I will NOT tolerate you acting like that bastard who hurt Ranko!"</p><p>"I am nothing like that piece of garbage!" Akane screamed back.</p><p>"Really, Akane!" Sakura demanded, "You beat her anytime she did something that you either imagined or anything you didn't like! To me that's abuse and no better than what that bastard did!"</p><p>Sakura quickly pushed back as Akane punched at her, rolling to s stop a few feet away. "See what I mean, you are resorting to violence because someone is questioning your beliefs? Do you think I know any fighting to protect myself, as far as you know I can't and that would mean you are attacking someone weaker than you, Akane. What is one of the more tenants of any form of martial artist?"</p><p>"SHUT UP!" Akane screamed, a battle aura burning brightly around her.</p><p>"It's to protect the weak, Akane." Sakura said, "What you are doing is being a bully."</p><p>"SHUT UP!" Akane screamed again as she rushed toward Sakura to attack her. The last moment though Sakura dropped down while quickly spinning on one of her blades and extending her other leg into a sweep knocking Akane off of her feet. Jumping up and away from Akane Sakura laughed.</p><p>"Oh yeah, Akane…I'll answer my own question." Sakura said, "Yeah, I can fight. Pretty good too if I do say so myself."</p><p>"AAARRRGGGHHHHHH!" Akane shrieked as she jumped up and lunged at Sakura who dodged each attack easily with the extra speed of her blades. Jumping over a kick, dodging to the side of a punch, rolling back from another punch, jumping another kick…It went on and on until Sakura noticed Akane starting to tire and begin messing up. Jumping into the air Sakura twisted her body and extended her leg into a kick catching Akane's jaw knocking the girl spinning back to land on the ground crying.</p><p>"I'm not like him!" Akane sobbed, "I don't want to be!"</p><p>"Akane…if you don't want to be you don't have to." Sakura sighed, maybe she went too far in this but Ranko and her safety came well over Akane's own in Sakura's book. Not that Sakura wouldn't help Akane if anything ever happened but if she had to choose between one of them then it would be Ranko.</p><p>She didn't believe Akane was really a bad person, she just held so much anger in her that made the girl a ticking time bomb. She needed to see that being that way was not much difference than being a bully or when Genma had beat Ranko.</p><p>"I…I can't control it…" Akane sobbed, lying on the ground shaking.</p><p>"Shhhh…" Sakura said kneeling down to help Akane sit up and winced at the bruise on Akane's face. "Akane…if you can't control your anger then you should get help with it. If you don't it will only get you into trouble."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Sakura…" Akane cried.</p><p>"I should be sorry to, Akane." Sakura said, "I guess I was kind of the bully this time, I was just so angry when I heard that you used to hit Ranko and when I found out more about it…"</p><p>"You're right, Sakura." Akane sniffed, "I am a bully. I want to get control of my anger."</p><p>"I might be able to help you a little with it Akane if you are patient enough but you should also see an anger management counselor or something."</p><p>"I want to…" Akane whispered. "How can you help me though?"</p><p>"I'll teach you some very good meditation techniques that I picked up from this one girl I knew a while back when I trained under Uncle Kuno." Sakura said, "I think her name was Raven or something like that. I use them a lot myself, they really help to calm you."</p><p>"Thanks." Akane said.</p><p>"Friends?" Sakura asked.</p><p>"Friends." Akane said, smiling and letting Sakura help her up.</p><p>"But if I ever see you attack Ranko or anyone else without cause I will kick your ass again until I get the point into your head." Sakura said.</p><p>"Okay…" Akane whispered.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>Bast smiled as she found her target walking back home after getting down at Tofu's. She jumped down in front of Kasumi and shifted into her human form and walked next to her. The smell coming off of Kasumi made Bast smile even more, "Hi Kasumi." Bast said, startling Kasumi.</p><p>"Hi, Bast." Kasumi said happily.</p><p>"I wanted to offer you a chance to become one of my avatars, Kasumi." Bast said, smiling. "Like Ranko is now."</p><p>"I appreciate it, Bast, but I have to refuse." Kasumi said, "I don't think I'd make a very good one."</p><p>"Nonsense girl, you'd make a great avatar." Bast said, "But I'll let you think about it for awhile. More importantly, I want details girl."</p><p>"D-Details?" Kasumi asked blushing.</p><p>"Yes details." Bast said with a smirk, "I can smell it on you, girl. I never thought you of all people would have had it in you. I can't blame you though, Tofu is such a hunk."</p><p>"BAST!" Kasumi exclaimed, her face turning completely red causing Bast to giggle a bit.</p><p>"Relax, girl, I think it's great that you found someone." Bast said, "But tell me…how good was he?"</p><p>"Wh-Wh-Wh…" Kasumi tried to say giving the perfect impression of a fish.</p><p>"I bet it was great…but I'll stop teasing you about it for now." Bast said, "I need to find Xellos tonight…have some fun of my own."</p><p>"What happened to Xellos anyways?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"He wanted to go see about getting something for Ranko." Bast said, "She should be back by the beginning of the week."</p><p>"How are you going to find him?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Well…I am a Goddess." Bast giggled. "I seriously do think you would make a great avatar, Kasumi. You may not be very adept at hurting people or fighting but you have other unique gifts. And some of my gifts could enhance them, even do stuff you never dreamed possible."</p><p>"L-Like what?" Kasumi asked, interest crossing her face.</p><p>"Like healing, Kasumi." Bast said, "One of my gifts could let you heal most minor wounds and help heal more major ones. You are great with helping people, Kasumi and treating them. This would only help you even more."</p><p>"I don't know." Kasumi said as the kept walking.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Nodoka sighed as she looked at the two manila folders that she had carried. Kyo had done a great job gathering all of the information that she asked for on Ukyo Kuonji. The restaurant was nice, she remembered it from when they cam thee before but she had learned so much about the girl then.</p><p>Walking in the front door she was greeted by a boy dressed as a girl who she was sure many believed that he truly was a she.</p><p>"Welcome to U-Chan's." the boy said, "My name is Konatsu and I'll be your waitress today."</p><p>"I'm sorry, I'm not here to eat young man." Nodoka said, "I've come to speak with Ukyo Kuonji about an important matter."</p><p>"That's me, sugar." The girl behind the grill said.</p><p>"Good day, Ms Kuonji." Nodoka said, "I came to speak about an important matter with you."</p><p>"Konatsu, please put up the closed sign." Ukyo said.</p><p>"Right away Mistress." Konatsu said doing as Ukyo had asked.</p><p>"How can I help you, Mrs. Saotome?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"My name is not Saotome, it's Kuno." Nodoka said coldly causing Ukyo to flinch. "I want to know what you plan to do about my daughter. Do you plan to seek vengeance for something she had no part in?"</p><p>"No…I don't know…" Ukyo sighed, "I…I don't want to but my dad is forcing me to. He…I called him and he said to kill her or don't come back."</p><p>"If you attack my daughter there will be dire consequences, Ukyo." Nodoka said handing Ukyo the first folder which contained several incidents where Ukyo had attacked Ranma with her battle spatula. "I can either press charges on you for attacking my child or have your entire clan eliminated. While I don't care for that option I will do anything to protect my family."</p><p>"You'd just be doing me a favor." Ukyo sighed, looking like she wanted to cry.</p><p>"Tell me, Ukyo. Do you like my daughter?" Nodoka asked, "As a friend or sister."</p><p>"Yes." Ukyo said softly.</p><p>"Tell me, what would you think of leaving the Kuonji clan?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I-I don't know." Ukyo said.</p><p>"Look at this." Nodoka said handing the second file to Ukyo. She watched as the girl looked over the paperwork inside in shock and then hope. That folder contained all of the paperwork she needed to in order for Ukyo's father to be charged with child abandonment and endangerment as well as conspiracy to commit murder. In affect, Ukyo would be taken out of his custody and put under Nodoka's custody. It also contained all the paperwork to officially bring Ukyo into the Kuno clan as Nodoka's daughter. All the papers needed is signed and dated by Ukyo.</p><p>"I-Is this for real?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Yes it is, all you have to do is decide if you prefer a father who treated you like dirt or a mother and family who would love and support you." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Konatsu, bring me a pen." Ukyo said with tears running freely and a big smile.</p><p>"Welcome to the family dear," Nodoka said hugging the girl before her.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>Ryoga sat under the bridge thinking how ironic that he was in the same place he knew Ranma…well, Ranko went when she needed time to herself to think. He liked Ranko very much but he doubted that after all of the times he had attacked her thinking that she was Ranma.</p><p>At first he thought maybe they could work things out and hopefully become closer but seeing how close she was to Bakura, that was pretty much not going to happen. He still cared for Akane too but he also didn't know what to do there, he couldn't face her with the truth and he couldn't start a relationship with her without being completely honest.</p><p>He had no idea what to do or where to go now. A part of him wanted to stay in Nerima just to be close to Ranko, he wanted to protect her. Yes she was strong but she was so vulnerable too, all of that confidence and bravado was all an act that she was forced into thanks to Genma.</p><p>Maybe he could also go back and find his home, it had been so long since he had been there. He hadn't seen his step father, mother or sister in years though it wasn't from lack of trying. With his curse now maybe he would go check it out, see how everyone is doing.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>"How are you feeling, child?" Cologne asked entering Shampoo's room. Shampoo was lying on her bed staring at the ceiling and sighed.</p><p>"Shampoo…I…would like to stay here, Great Grandmother." Shampoo said, "I'd like to try going to school when starts again. Make friends with Ranko and others. Sha…I'm tired of being lonely, fighting for too too stupid laws. I want to choose my own path."</p><p>"I'm glad child." Cologne said, "I can't think of a better place to spend my final days."</p><p>"Is sick?" Shampoo asked worried as she sat up.</p><p>"No, child, just old." Cologne said. "I also just talked to Mousse, he would like to stay as well. I believe the fool has grown some kind of big brother complex for Ranko"</p><p>"Shampoo notice." Shampoo giggled, "He very cute that way."</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>Tatewaki laughed as Kodachi, Tomoyo and himself sat in the darkened theater watching the strange comedy. He had never done something so simple for so long and it made him feel so good. He enjoyed spending time with his cousin and sister who he really did care for. The only thing missing was his new sister Ranko and the girl who has been haunting his thoughts as of late.</p><p>He remembered how Nabiki used to act before the madness overtook him, she was a little cold then but nothing like the ice queen of recent times. She was still proud though and was so set on making money on her own, even if it was by distasteful means, in order to support her family after her mother's death.</p><p>There was no way of getting Nabiki to take money that he tried to give her then, she was so set on making it by her own means. So he did what he could by making huge bets that he knew he had no chance of winning then by paying insane amounts of money for pictures of Akane. He had a crush on Akane back then and was good friends with Nabiki. They were innocent shots then.</p><p>He cringed thinking of that and how he demanded so much more from the pictures when the madness had started when Kodachi started experimenting with her plants. He hated himself for that and the way he treated Ranko, he should have realized who it was but the madness wouldn't let him connect the dots.</p><p>Something changes though in Nabiki just before the madness took place. At first it was a huge depression that slowly turned to burning anger and hatred then finally to indifference giving birth to the Ice Queen of Furinkan High.</p><p>Now though, he wondered if it was just from her mother's death, something about it just didn't add up but he didn't know what. Right now though, he wanted to protect all of them, the Tendos and Kunos. They were his family and friends and he was intent on making up for all the troubles that he caused in the past</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Li knew that he was making Meilin angry during there sparing matches earlier but he couldn't bring himself to care as he soaked in the warm relaxing waters of the furo. He just couldn't focus on it with his mind stuck on two different girls who felt different things for.</p><p>Ranko, she was beautiful and a firey personality that was very attractive to him but for some reason he didn't think that that was the reason he was drawn to her. Maybe he just wanted to protect her, after all that happened to her she did need friends and family who was willing to support and protect her. The problem was that that didn't seem right either. He remembered feeling this way once before with a young man who passed through there. His mother had told him that it was his magic reacting strongly to the magic in the man. It was very similar in style and strength to Li's which resonated with him. His mother had said when it resonates it can often feel like attraction. If that was true, then did that mean that he didn't love Ranko, could it just be her magic?</p><p>Sakura was a different story though, he had only met her a few times but when she saved him from that fire neither one of them wanted to move from looking into each other's eyes. He felt such a strong connection with her and he was sure she felt the same way but why? Could those sappy stories that his mother used to tell about soulmates actually be true? He did feel a very strong link with Sakura and it was different that with Ranko.</p><p>Sighing he slid farther down into the water, he had to figure it out.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, I'm not sure yet but the next chapter will probably be part one of the judgment, Li vs. Yue. I hope everyone is enjoying this story so far. I have started work on the first chapter of the sequel but I'm not sure what to call it or the prequel yet but the sequel's first chapter will be posted a few days after I finish this part of the story then I'm going to take like a week's break to read some stories before I start heavily working on the next part.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> Sorry about that, Ranko really does need more confidence though and beating Yue will probably both hurt and help her. She will get more confidence though as she learns more though and she will be purring soon and hopefully say those three words that Bakura is dying to hear.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> It might, that's a very good idea, thanks.</p><p><b>Ebona Nite:</b> I was actually debating between Tofu and Kasumi being Yue. If it was Kasumi I would have made it the reason Tofu was like that saying that he could since it and it always overpowered his senses. Plus it would have been a huge plot twist. I'm happy with Tofu being Yue though, it leaves Kasumi open to become another of Bast's chosen if she agrees. Thanks, hope you liked this chapter.</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> Good luck on your games but as for the trash part getting old, not really. I know from experience that it's normal for someone who was raped to feel that way for a very long time and Ranko had to deal with so much more. I hope you like this chapter.</p><p><b>Den Scurman:</b> Thanks, and I know that they have every right to see each other, he never did anything to my brother. Still, I hate him for everything that he did and I'm sorry if I sound bad about it but I can't help feeling that way about him. It's a very good possibility with Bakura running the gauntlet and Sakura did confront Akane this chapter and I'm hoping everyone liked it. Kasumi did something that she may regret a little bit later on but not much because everything will work out. Your welcome, and the judgment may begin next chapter. If I do bring them in it will probably be just a cameo unless I do something that I've been debating. How does Makoto being Ryoga's sister sound? I'll make sure to check it out as soon as I take my break in a couple days, thanks.</p><p><b>Firehedgehog:</b> Hope you enjoyed this chapter, thanks.</p><p>Thank you everyone for all of your reviews, kind words, support and great idea.</p><p>Also, thank you to everyone who had read this story and enjoyed it.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
