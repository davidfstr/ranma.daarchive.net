</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 9</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>For the happiest day of Nodoka's life in the last few years, her nerves where almost totally shot. Nabiki was sitting on her bed as Nodoka paced back and forth in front of her trying to gain control on her feelings so she didn't strangle Nabiki. The girl seemed like such a good girl so there had to be a reason, at least there better be.</p><p>And after she got done here she still had to go downstairs and deal with Tatewaki. He had some kind of infatuation with both Akane and Ranko that neither one of them wanted, or at least that's what they said. Besides, Tatewaki and Ranko were cousins anyways so there couldn't be anything between them.</p><p>Then there was this Kero creature that was hanging out with her daughter. Usually, Nodoka was very cautious of such things even if they no longer fazed her but this Kero seemed to be her daughter's best friend and possibly lifeline. It may have looked harmless but she had seen so many other things that looked harmless turn out to be very dangerous. She almost laughed when she thought of that one girl, Nuku Nuku she believed, who single handedly trashed a hi tech assault helicopter and a power suit and all in ten minutes.</p><p>"Nabiki," Nodoka said as she stopped and looked at the girl straight into the eyes, "I want to know the truth, the whole truth behind why you was selling photos of my daughter, photos I may remind you that could be considered porn."</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Auntie." Nabiki said, looking down at her hands in her lap as she kept wringing them. "I didn't know Ranko was who she was, when they came to our home I thought they was just freeloaders and we was having enough money troubles as it was. Betting pools and Akane's photos could only bring in so much."</p><p>"What about your father, what was he doing then?" Nodoka asked, shocked that this girl was involved in this kind of stuff. It seemed she was trying to make money for her family, which Nodoka respected her for but she did not like the methods of the girl.</p><p>"He…He never recovered after mom's death…" Nabiki whispered, "In a way…he died when she did. Kasumi took over taking care of the house and us and I…I did what I could to keep us afloat financially. Today…today was the first time since mom died that I seen daddy act like he used to."</p><p>Nodoka sat down on the bed next to the girl and pulled her into a tight hug for a few moments before pulling away. "I guess it's okay Nabiki but no more, do I make myself clear?"</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Nabiki said sadly.</p><p>"Nabiki, you have a lot of experience with bookkeeping?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Y-yes, why Auntie?" Nabiki asked confused.</p><p>"Promise me that you will completely stop all of that, the photos and the betting rings and whatever else you do and I will get you a very well paying job in accounting. But you must finish school and college which will be paid for as part of the benefits package." Nodoka said.</p><p>"I promise!" Nabiki cried as she glomped Nodoka, "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"</p><p>"You are very welcome dear," Nodoka said, "I'm giving you a second chance dear, I can see why you did everything but don't let it happen again. I don't want to see you in trouble."</p><p>"Sure Auntie…" Nabiki said as she grew nervous, "If this is a sure thing, can I get a small advancement…for our…mortgage."</p><p>"Mortgage? You're paying a mortgage?" Nodoka asked shocked.</p><p>"Two of them…like I said we were already struggling since dad…" Nabiki said.</p><p>"It's okay dear," Nodoka said, "I'll give you a hire bonus. It'll be enough to pay off what ever your mortgages are and be plenty enough to last until the end of the summer."</p><p>"End of the summer?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Of course, dear." Nodoka said, "For the summer just kick back and relax and when school starts again you will be working three nights a week for three hours a night checking the books for a toy store I have in town. The accountant for it has decided to retire in a few months and you will be there replacement. You can keep it as long as you want and when you get out of college I'll help you get a job anywhere you want. You wouldn't believe the amount of contacts my family has."</p><p>"Thank you so much, Auntie." Nabiki said as she glomped Nodoka again.</p><p>"It's okay, really." Nodoka giggled.</p><p>Nodoka's spirits was a little higher as she left Nabiki's room and started down the stairs to face her nephew. It felt so good to help out Nabiki and the girl's family, doing things like that always made her feel good inside. She was never greedy like Genma was but she did use to be way too traditional. When that bastard took off with Ranko though that changed. Now Nodoka could care less about tradition, tradition is what she blamed on Ranko's kidnapping.</p><p>"Hi Auntie." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"Hello, dear." Nodoka said as she took a seat opposite of her nephew at the table. "We have a few things to discuss. First of all is your infatuation with my daughter, 'the pig tailed girl and fiery goddess.'</p><p>"I am sorry for I knew not that she was of relation but the fierce tigress Akane Tendo is not, and I will free them both from the foul sorcerer's clutches." Tatewaki said, "For the honor of my cousin and my beloved Tigress."</p><p>"Kuno, can't you talk a little more normally," Nodoka sighed, rubbing her temples with her thumb and index finger of her right hand. "Akane does not love you so don't harass her."</p><p>"But Auntie, that's just because of the foul sorcerer Saotome." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"You mean Genma?" Nodoka asked, shocked. Did Genma do something to Akane to?</p><p>"Nay, Auntie, but it was the fool Ranma Saotome." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Nay, but the son of Genma Saotome." Tatewaki said, "He claimed to be of one mind and one body."</p><p>"I'll deal with whoever this Ranma is, Tatewaki. And there will be no argument over it." Nodoka said, "And I'm going to tell you something about what happened to Ranko. Hopefully it will get through that thick head of yours."</p><p>"O-of course, Auntie." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"Ranko was beaten and raped by Genma, Tatewaki. Neither she or her friends are to be harassed by you. She may be acting okay but I seriously doubt she is though, and your crap sure isn't helping any. If I catch you harassing anyone, there WILL be consequences, do I make myself clear?"</p><p>"Of course, A-Auntie." Said a very pale Tatewaki.</p><p>Nodoka smiled in satisfaction as the doorbell rang. "I'll get it." Alita called.</p><p>Ranko laid on her bed staring at the ceiling, it had been a long day and she was tired, both emotionally and physically. She was so happy to be back with her mother and the knowledge that her mother loved her made it even better. For most of the day while they shopped was great, it got Ranko's mind off of everything that happened. The problem was every time she let her mind wander…it went back to the previous night and what Genma did to her.</p><p>"Hey, kiddo." Kero said as he landed on her bed and stuck his face over Ranko's vision, "Are you okay?"</p><p>"I-I don't know K-Kero…so much is happening so fast." Ranko said, starting to cry. "I'm so happy that I-m b-back with mom b-but I…I feel so dirty still, Kero. I feel so worthless."</p><p>"Ranko…" Kero said softly.</p><p>"Then…I feel like Nabiki betrayed me but if she didn't…I don't blame her and yet I do Kero…It's so confusing. I…I feel like it's their fault what he did to me last n-night b-but…I know it wasn't…h-he just hated that I existed…"</p><p>"Kiddo, stop worrying about this stuff." Kero said as he wiped Ranko's tears away, "You aren't worthless, Ranko…Genma is. It was all his fault but after all you've been through you have every right to be confused and hurting. But I'm here for you and so is your mom, we both love you."</p><p>"T-Thanks, Kero." Ranko sniffed.</p><p>"No prob, kid but you should try and get your mind off of it…Let's go try out the pool, I bet everybody is still putting everything away. I'll help you finish putting everything up here when we get back."</p><p>Swimming, that actually sounded like fun and she did need to get her mind off of everything. She got up and looked through the bags scattered on the floor until she came to her new black one-piece and a beach towel. "At least it covers the bruises and everything…" Ranko whispered and shook her head to clear her thoughts. She needed to be cheerful for her mother and Kero, they already done so much for her, she didn't want to bother them anymore with her negative thoughts. Besides, swimming was one of her favorite things to do.</p><p>It wasn't long before she was changed and headed down the stairs quietly so no one would hear with Kero following right behind her. She was passing by the living room as Alita almost ran right into her. Kero flew up to the ceiling so the woman wouldn't see him.</p><p>"I am so sorry, Alita." Ranko said.</p><p>"It was my fault," Alita said, "Besides, you and Akane have some friends waiting in the living room."</p><p>"Thanks." Ranko said confused. What friends did she have besides the ones that were already here? Well, Alita did say they were here for Akane to which meant it was probably Sayuri and Yuka. As soon as she stepped into the living room though she stopped dead in her tracks…she didn't want to deal with THEM now. On the sofa sat Ryoga and Ukyo, both of them looking like they ran all of the way here.</p><p>"Hi Ranma." Ryoga said with a little bit of a blush.</p><p>"Are you okay, Ranchan?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Where's this Ranma?" Nodoka demanded as she walked into the room.</p><p>"She's right there, Ma'am." Ryoga said as he motioned toward Ranko but tried not to look at her.</p><p>"Young man, that's my daughter Ranko, not Ranma." Nodoka said in somewhat confusion.</p><p>"What!" demanded Ukyo, "What kind of games are you playing, Ranma honey?"</p><p>"Ucchan…it's true…" Ranko said, "I was born a girl…"</p><p>"Ranma, this is not funny!" Ukyo said as she pulled her battle spatula out and pointed toward Ranko.</p><p>"Ukyo…Ranma…He's probably…after last night…he's probably traumatized or something." Ryoga said, "Don't push him, please."</p><p>"Look, I don't know who this Ranma is but I do know my daughter Ranko and if you don't put that thing away and stop threatening my daughter you won't walk out of here."</p><p>Nodoka growled.</p><p>"Ukyo, Ranma's been through enough…please…" Ryoga said.</p><p>"Last night…Ryoga, what did you mean?" Ranko asked fearing his answer, if he knew…and Ukyo knew…it wouldn't be long until everyone would know.</p><p>"I was…I was in my cursed form Ranma…he got the drop on me and tied me up, I think he was going to…kill me after…he…finished with…" Ryoga stammered.</p><p>"NO!" Ranko screamed, covering her ears, crying. "DON'T SAY IT!"</p><p>"Ranko." Nodoka said as she put her hand on Ranko's shoulder. Ranko pulled away and ran out of the room and up the stairs and into her room slamming the door as she went. She dove into her bed and sobbed into her pillow, clutching Kero when he landed next to her.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Kero asked.</p><p>"N-no," Ranko sobbed, "Now everyone is g-going to know h-how weak and w-worthless I am."</p><p>"Shh…you aren't worthless, Ranko." Kero whispers, "You aren't."</p><p>"Honey." Nodoka said as she came in and sat down on the bed and gathered Ranko in her arms, "You aren't worthless, you are the most precious thing in this world to me."</p><p>Ranko felt a little better as her mom held her and allowed her to cry. She felt so safe in those arms, they seemed to hold a promise of safety and love. She couldn't stop herself from crying though, she wanted to be strong but knowing Ryoga knew about what happened…something about that devastated her for some reason.</p><p>"What happened, Ranchan?" Ukyo whispered to herself as Ryoga and her as they watched mother console her child.</p><p>"I think we need to leave them alone." Ryoga said, pulling Ukyo away from the door.</p><p>"But…but…Ranchan…" Ukyo said.</p><p>"Ranma's mom will make sure that he'll be okay." Ryoga said sadly.</p><p>"Will you two please come with me?" Alita asked as she walked up to them. As the two nodded Alita turned and led them downstairs and into the library. "Young man, you said something about a cursed form?"</p><p>"Y-yeah…" Ryoga said, sighing.</p><p>"What kind of cursed form?" the woman asked as she went over to a shelf and looked for a moment pulling out a thick book and carried it over to the table in the middle of the room and sat it down. Ukyo stared at some of the titles, many of them seemed to have curses, magic or demonology in the titles. This place was starting to spook Ukyo pretty bad, what were these people, witches or something?</p><p>"A jusenkyo curse." Ryoga said. The woman flipped through the book scanned over a page and turned a few more pages.</p><p>"Here it is, there are multiple sights where what is refereed to as a two bit hack mage created cursed springs while trying to create youth elixir. Most sights are found in China but are spread out because when the locals found out they drove him away. Some springs though because of either people trying to remove the curses or foreign elements or even because of just the magic evolving have been drastically changed. There are hot springs that the curses are the reverse of the normal curses then there are those which make the curses permanent while others will take your soul and the soul of how drowned there will take over your body." Alita read. "So, which springs did you fall into anyways?"</p><p>"The spring of drowned pig." Ukyo said.</p><p>"Okay, but where?" Alita asked.</p><p>"The training grounds of Jusenkyo." Ryoga said. "Ranma was cursed to become a girl there."</p><p>"I heard you refer to Ranko as Ranma…does that mean she has a curse…wait a sec, cursed to become a girl?" Alita asked, looking back over the passage, "Oh, hell no."</p><p>"Why do you keep calling my Ranchan, Ranko?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"What is Ranko to you?" Alita asked.</p><p>"Genma made an agreement with my dad that we would get married when we were kids." Ukyo said, "Then the jackass took off with my dowry and left me by the side of the road."</p><p>"I'm sorry to say this dear, but Ranma is Ranko…sounds like…she was cursed at the hot springs." Alita said. "And also, even if she really was this Ranma and a boy, any arrangements as important as that has to be okayed by the head of the Kuno clan."</p><p>"Stop playing games with me!" Ukyo snapped, "I knew Ranchan when we were six years old and I know he was a boy!"</p><p>"Maybe Ranko was cursed when she was little." Alita said, "But if you start any trouble, let's just say the head of the Kuno clan will probably most likely eliminate your entire clan if you mess with his niece. He is very protective of…family…"</p><p>"But why did he…she…always cause trouble with me?" Ryoga asked.</p><p>"Ryoga, maybe you haven't noticed it, but you are very good looking." Alita said, "Ranko probably had a crush on you and didn't know how to express herself."</p><p>"Then why…" Ryoga said, "He led me home all those times when we was kids and back to school…helped me out all those times even though I was always mad about him stealing all the bread…Oh god, he…she had a crush on me…I was trying to hurt a girl?"</p><p>"Ryoga, you are not believing all of this crap, are you?" Ukyo demanded.</p><p>"It's possible, Ukyo…Isn't it?" Ryoga asked, going over to look at the book. Ukyo joined him and saw all of the maps and what type each set of springs was.</p><p>"Oh god, Ryoga." Ukyo said, pointing to the page, "Warning, there are no none cure to the curses though there are several artifacts that will lock a victim in there cursed form. If a victim is splashed by different waters of the springs it will only compound the curses. For example, a victim that falls in the spring of drowned cat and then falls into the spring of drowned eagle will then be cursed to become a half cat, half eagle. It's impossible to tell what the victim will become since one time this happened the victim became something like a griffon and another time they became a winged cat."</p><p>"No-No cure?" Ryoga asked, "I'm stuck like this forever?"</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, I'm really glad that everyone seems to be enjoying this story. Nodoka has dealt with Nabiki and Tatewaki (I'm going to start referring to him as that instead of Kuno since there are so many Kunos now and possibly more to come.) Nodoka has more money than she knows what to do with since she rejoined the clan and wanted to help out Nabiki and her family. Also, Ryoga and Ukyo have caught up with Ranko and though Ryoga is starting to believe it, Ukyo is having a harder time believing it.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> Ranko was just really happy that her mother was back with her and when she realized Nodoka really cared about her it made her extremely happy and took her mind off of things for awhile. Now she is just trying to be strong for everyone but as happened in this chapter she crashed emotionally and will probably several more times and maybe even harder. She will probably start seeing a councilor as will someone else if he doesn't get his act together. Sorry about the Madison and Tomoya/Tomoyo thing, it's hard to remember at times how to spell it. Thanks, I should have one chapter per day for now since I don't have much else to do with my leg broken and my family not wanting me to go anywhere without them. Stupid bike…knew I shouldn't have asked for a ride on it.</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> Yep, she was and Nodoka does to which she is going to give Nabiki a very good, well paying job at. That way, they can still get a few things from one while they're visiting.</p><p><b>TheCentauress:</b> Kodachi will probably be a lot easier to deal with that Tatewaki was, by a long ways. Something bad will definitely befall Genma but I'm not sure yet, I had so many wonderful suggestions sent in and I love them all.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> Wow, that is the best site I've seen about the cards. Thank you so much. As for Nabiki, when Nodoka learned about why Nabiki was doing it she couldn't really punish her but she did help her so Nabiki won't have to do it anymore or get involved with the yakuza on accident and get in trouble. More great Genma Punishment suggestions, thank you. (Loves all the different ways the panda can die, ohohoho.)</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk</b>: Yep, Ryoga is definitely on Ranko's side now and may even stay on her side afterwards. He can't and won't strike a girl in cold blood and now that he knows the truth, he probably won't go back to attacking Ranko if he can accept it.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b> Nodoka wasn't to harsh with Nabiki and actually ended up helping her. Nabiki was getting tired of what she was doing as she was seeing what it was doing to Akane and now she knows that it was affecting Ranko more than she thought and was only doing it to help her family to begin with. As for Ukyo/Ryoga pairing, actually I wasn't really planning on it but it's a good idea, thanks. And for as when this is taking place in the Ranmaverse, its a few months after Ranko showed up. I may of changed the timeline a little, I have the amazons, Ryoga and Ukyo and of course the Kuno's and the principal and Hinako. I haven't had Happosai show up yet for various reasons though I could write him into the story since I haven't really said he hasn't shown up yet. I'm just not to sure if I should have him in this story or not.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> Ranko didn't really know about the invisibility yet since he hasn't unsealed the forbidden techniques though he already knows them and can easily use them though he was hiding them for such an occasion.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who has read this story and enjoyed it so far. Also, thank you to everyone who has reviewed to let me know their opinions on this story and give their wonderful suggestions and very interesting ways to punish Genma.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
