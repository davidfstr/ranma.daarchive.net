</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting  Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 19</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by  Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½  created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card  Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't  own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>Ranko relaxed in a deck  chair out back of the estate with Sakura, Tomoyo, Akane and Nabiki  sunbathing. She felt very self conscious though wearing the swimsuit  Nabiki supplied. She sure the heck wouldn't have worn it if any of  the guys were at home or if the wall wasn't tall enough to block  anyone's view. She kept her ears and eyes open for anyone  approaching nervously.</p><p>"Relax Ranko."  Nabiki said from her left.</p><p>"Relax?" Ranko  asked, "Nabiki, I don't exactly like the idea of someone seeing  me mostly naked."</p><p>"You aren't naked,  Ranko." Nabiki said, "You have on a bikini."</p><p>"It's the same  difference!" Ranko exclaimed.</p><p>"No it's not, Ranko  and its just us girls so don't worry about it." Nabiki said,  "Besides, you look very good in it."</p><p>Ranko sighed at that, a  part of her was happy that Nabiki thought she looked good. All of the  bruises and damage had already healed otherwise there would have been  no way this would have happened. Another part of her mind hated that  she did look good in the bikini which was what was making her  nervous.</p><p>"Ranko…I know it's  hard at first but you shouldn't hide yourself forever." Nabiki  whispered, "If you really want to stop we can go inside and do  something else."</p><p>"No…it's okay  Nabiki, thank you." Ranko said.</p><p>"No problem...I do  want to talk to you about something though." Nabiki said, "It's  about our parents…have you seen how they've been acting toward  each other lately?"</p><p>"Yeah, I think my mom  likes your dad." Ranko said.</p><p>"Exactly…how do you  feel about that?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Yeah, I've seen  them making goo goo eyes at each other a lot." Sakura giggled.</p><p>"I…I don't know.  If they make each other happy then I'm happy for them." Ranko  said.</p><p>"What if the get  married?" Tomoyo asked.</p><p>"If they did then I'd  have three new sisters." Ranko said, "I'd be happy about it."</p><p>"I'm glad."  Nabiki said, "My dad's been acting so different lately, like he  used to act before…He needs to move on and I'm glad it's with  your mom."</p><p>"Me to, Nabiki."  Ranko said.</p><p>"I'd love to see  them get married." Akane said.</p><p>"It'd be nice."  Ranko said, sitting up quickly and looking behind them but no one was  there.</p><p>"Ranko…lets go in."  Nabiki sighed.</p><p>"No…I'm sorry…I  just feel…I don't want any of the guys to see me." Ranko said,  "I also feel like I'm being perverted lying out here half naked…"</p><p>"Ranko…you aren't  being perverted…" Akane said.</p><p>"But…when you  thought…you said I was when I was looking at the swimsuits and  picked a bikini up." Ranko whispered.</p><p>"Ranko, that's when  I thought you were a guy." Akane said.</p><p>"What's the  difference though, Akane?" Ranko asked. She wasn't being mean,  she just didn't truly understand.</p><p>"Ranko…I thought  you were just a guy trying to get a kick…" Akane started.</p><p>"Akane…what  difference did it make?" Nabiki asked, "Even if it was Ranma, it  was still her body at the time. And if Ranko was a boy, that would  have to of been difficult to not ever be able to swim in his real  body."</p><p>"But…but…"  Akane tried to say.</p><p>"It's okay, Akane…I  understand." Ranko said getting up from her chair, "I think I'm  starting to burn so I'm going to go in."</p><p>Ranko could hear Nabiki  as she closed the door saying, "Nice going Akane."</p><p>It hurt Ranko when she  thought about it, Akane had to think she was still a pervert. She  didn't understand how it was different though, as much as she hated  her curse, especially after everything that happened, that body was  still hers. So why was he a pervert and she wasn't in Akane's  eyes? Akane had to still believe she was a pervert but was just being  nice after everything that happened.</p><p>"Ranko, what's  wrong?" Kasumi asked as she walked up to Ranko.</p><p>"Nothing." Ranko  said, looking at the floor.</p><p>"Ranko, you're  crying." Kasumi said, "Now what's wrong?"</p><p>"I don't know,  Kasumi…I…I just don't know." Ranko said as she cried. "I'm  scared of one of the guys seeing me…I'm worried I'm being  perverted…"</p><p>"Ranko." Kasumi  said hugging Ranko, "Do you think Nabiki is being perverted?"</p><p>"N-No…" Ranko  said.</p><p>"And neither are you,  Akane was wrong to say that stuff to you and I was wrong in not  stopping her." Kasumi said, "I know all of us hurt you and I'm  sorry but I'll do anything to make up for it as I'm sure the  others will to."</p><p>"I'm sorry,  Kasumi…" Ranko said pulling away. "We were just lying out there  then I started thinking about when I went to buy a swimsuit and I  picked up a bikini wondering how in the world that thing even covered  anything. Then Akane…she saw me and called me a stupid  pervert…and…"</p><p>"You aren't a  pervert, Ranko, trust me…I'll even tell you a secret…" Kasumi  said as she leaned in to whisper in Ranko's ear, "Akane keeps  manga under her mattress…very, very perverted manga."</p><p>"Really?" Ranko  asked, shocked.</p><p>"Really." Kasumi  said, "So you see, Akane is more the perverted one around here but  there isn't anything wrong with being a little perverted. It's  natural to be, even I am dear. I have dreams sometimes of doing some  very naughty things with Tofu."</p><p>"Kasumi!" Ranko  gasped, shocked even again.</p><p>"Its natural, Ranko."  Kasumi giggled, then sobered. "What isn't natural or okay to do  is forcing someone to do something they don't want."</p><p>"Like rape…"  Ranko said sadly.</p><p>"Exactly, Ranko, but  rape doesn't make the victim any less of a person or even make them  dirty. It is a terrible thing to happen to anyone but they only  worthless person involved in it is the bastard who is forcing the  victim." Kasumi said. "Do you understand?"</p><p>"Y-Yeah…thanks,  Kasumi." Ranko said hugging Kasumi tightly.</p><p>"Good, now if you  want to go get changed and the two of us will go out for ice cream."  Kasumi said.</p><p>"Okay, thank you."  Ranko said as she hurried up her room.</p><p>"I'm sorry…"  Akane said.</p><p>"Do you realize the  kind of crap you cause because of you refusal to grow up, Akane?"  Nabiki asked. She loved her sister dearly but at the moment she could  wring the girl's neck. Nabiki sighed to herself, Akane wasn't the  only one to cause damage unknowingly to Ranko. "Look Akane, I'm  not totally innocent either but I'm working on making up for the  trouble I caused."</p><p>"What just happened?"  Sakura asked.</p><p>"It's a long  story." Nabiki said.</p><p>"How can I even start  to make it up to Ranko?" Akane asked.</p><p>"By growing up,  Akane. Stop judging people before you get to know them and stop  calling everyone who you think has a stray naughty thought a  pervert." Nabiki said, "I know about your secret stash, Akane so  if you ask me you're a hundred times more the perv than anything  you ever blamed on Ranko."</p><p>"H-How did you…"  Akane asked, turning bright red.</p><p>"I have my ways  little sister." Nabiki said. "Don't worry about that though,  just try to grow up before you hurt someone else like you hurt  Ranko."</p><p>"I'm going to go  check on Ranko." Tomoyo said as she got up.</p><p>"Wait for me."  Sakura said.</p><p>"I'll come to."  Nabiki said as she got up at the same time Akane did. It looked like  Akane had the same idea. As they walked inside Alita stopped them  before they got to the stairs.</p><p>"If you're looking  for Ranko, she just left with Kasumi." Alita said.</p><p>"Thanks, Alita."  Nabiki said, glad that Kasumi was with Ranko. Nabiki still worried  about Ranko, while the support group did seem to help and Ranko  seemed to be feeling so much better she knew that the pain would  never completely vanish. It must have been a lot worse for Ranko than  it was for her though, Ranko's own father, the girl's own flesh  and blood had violated her. While it still hurt Nabiki sometimes, at  least it wasn't her own father who did it. To Nabiki, that seemed  like one of the worse betrayals that could ever happen.</p>-<p>Bakura had finally  found his target, even if it was a stray Mau. In fact, he was  actually surprised that he did find one around there. He had spent  all morning debating over what to do about Ranko, his Kitten. He  wanted to help her so much and it seemed so wrong that someone  blessed with Bast's gifts would suffer so much in so many ways. At  least this way he could help.</p><p>He was standing in an  empty lot that there seemed to be hardly anyone around so he decided  it would be the best place. Pulling out the piece of chalk he started  work on the magic circle he needed for the spell to work. This was  one of the few spells he actually knew that didn't draw upon his  mastery over the shadow. In fact, this spell worried him a little  since Bast may exorcise his spirit from Ryou completely.</p><p>Finishing the circle he  sat the cat down in the middle of the circle and backed away from it.  "Oh, Goddess Bast, your humble servant Bakura begs for an audience.  Please use this vessel, your chosen messenger, to come forth unto  this plane and speak with this unworthy mortal."</p><p>Bakura watched the cat  expectedly, waiting for any sign of something happening. Of course he  himself never used this spell in his previous life in Egypt, his  promised was one of the Goddess's chosen after all, but he was  assured that it worked. So again he chanted the words again and held  his breath for a few moments but still nothing.</p><p>"Hey cutie." A  voice from behind him said causing him to jump and the voice giggle.  "I love it when people do that."</p><p>"Hey!" Bakura  growled turning around. There was a beautiful woman in white Egyptian  robes with long blue hair, black cat ears on top of her head and a  long black cat's tail twitching back and forth. Her eyes were a  deep green but her pupils, they were slitted like a cats. "B-Bast?"</p><p>"Got it in one,  cutie." Bast said, her eyes dancing with mirth as she eyed Bakura  hungrily.</p><p>"What happened to  you?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"A girl is entitled  to a change every hundred years or so, cutie." Bast replied,  licking her lips showing off her extended canines.</p><p>"I think I was better  off with the cat…" Bakura mumbled.</p><p>"What did you say?"  Bast growled, her eyes glowing red for a moment.</p><p>"N-Nothing my  Goddess." Bakura said, waving his hands in a placating manner.</p><p>"What did you want  anyways, cutie?" Bast asked, posing seductively, "Did you want to  have some fun?"</p><p>Bakura couldn't help  wondering if she was for real, this was not the Goddess he remembered  but for some reason knew it was Bast. "I know someone who could use  your help to remove the neko-ken from them."</p><p>"WHAT?" Bast  screeched, her body surrounded by a scorching red aura.</p><p>"Her worthless father  did it but I already punished him." Bakura said.</p><p>"So it's a girl."  Bast said, "Okay, I can do that and have another avatar."</p><p>"Do you even have any  avatars at the moment?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"Of course, cutie but  they aren't really much of a fighter. Of course compared to most  normal people these days they are exceptional I guess but they aren't  trained enough to utilize the full abilities my gift comes with. One  of the best ones is an American woman named Patience."</p><p>"Why me…"  grumbled Bakura.</p><p>"Well, let's go  find your girlfriend then." Bast said.</p><p>"Okay…Wait, she's  not my girlfriend!" Bakura said.</p><p>"Of course not  cutie," Bast said, "But you want her, I can see it in your eyes.  And don't worry, I know that you are a welcome guest in Ryou's  body so I won't expel you."</p><p>That was a great relief  to both Ryou and Bakura, both had become great friends and really  didn't want to lose each other. Now where to find Kitten?</p><p>"I can track her, I  sense only one person inflicted with the corrupted powers of my  messengers." Bast said. "You just drive your little toy and  follow my directions."</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, I'm  still taking votes on scenarios though I'm adding a quick summary  to a fourth one here. Instead of Ranma taking the curse's body  Bakura giving him his own physical body. The reason I wanted a fairly  powerful Ranma was because I was thinking about bringing Happi in but  since this is sooner I wanted to bring in a stronger Ranma to take  him on and perhaps help Cologne train Shampoo, Kodachi, Mousse, Ryoga  and Tatewaki to take him on as well as Ranko possibly. If Ranma does  come in though Happi may or may not appear in this part, he may  appear in the sequel. If Bakura gains his own body though it would  make things between him and Ranko a lot easier if that is who Ranko  chooses to be with. Whatever happens though will happen next chapter  and Bast will be a part of it.</p><p>Again,  my section breaks doesn't seem to be showing up. (sigh) I'm trying a  broken line this time, hope it works. (crosses fingers.)</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b>  You have a very good point and that may be a good idea. Perhaps a  little like Tokyo Mew Mew, when Ranko gets too nervous, excited or  anything her cat ears and tail will pop out as well as when she wants  to. While she is in that form she can have all of the abilities of  the neko-ken as well as more cat like abilities. As for why I was  thinking about brining in Ranma, I was considering bringing in  someone much more advanced to help Cologne train the others when  Happi shows up and maybe even Herb later on. As for Principal  Coconuts, that wasn't the end of him as he will be back a few times  and Akane will get her shot at him as well. He'll be a nuisance  like Tsubasa for awhile.</p><p><b>Cptdave:</b> Thanks,  I'm always open to suggestions. As for pairings, Li is in the  running but so is Bakura and Ryoga is always a possibility being an  old flame of Ranko's. Bast may become a permanent character but if  she does it'll be more to cause a little mischief here and there.  Any suggestions is helpful, I made a suggestion from Dragon Man180  into pretty much the basis for a whole chapter. Good luck at the Army  Recruiter school and thank you.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b>  Thanks, I wanted to have Bakura be one of the ones responsible for  helping get rid of the neko-ken. As for the principal part, Nodoka is  only going to be like a temporary thing until school is finished for  the year and all the faculty stuff is done. There will be a new  principal at the next school year (sequel) as Nodoka will be going  back to being Detective since she has come to love that job even  though she obviously doesn't need it. Thanks.</p><p><b>Windstrike:</b>  Thanks, and I was planning on using the cards but things just changed  so much as the story progressed that it will probably won't happen.  I've had several people ask about Happi and as is I don't really  want to bring him in unless there is a Ranma to counter him. Ranko  may be feeling better but I don't think she's ready to face him  yet, physically or emotionally. Thanks, I do try to update this story  everyday because of a promise I made.</p><p><b>Dragon-game:</b>  Thank you, I will and thanks for the vote.</p><p><b>AshK:</b> Thanks, I  wanted something really fitting for what he did and I also wanted  something a little original and I don't think I've seen something  like that happen to him.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b>  Thanks, it really does help and you make several really good points.  Bakura and Bast will be ending the neko-ken but the results are still  a toss up. I've added a fourth option though with Bakura being  spilt from Ryou and occupying the curse's body. The reason I was  thinking about Ranma though was because I want someone who can take  on Happi and help train the others to fight him. It did, thank you.</p><p><b>Kuubi:</b> Thanks,  as for the Duel Monsters, sorry. I'm not very good at writing  battle scenes of any type though I'm trying to get better at it.  That's the biggest hold up I'm having with Second Chances,  there's just so many battle scenes for that story and I have such a  hard time writing them. Old Life, New Beginnings is also another one  that suffers a little bit from those problems but I'm also  completely reworking where it's going. It was originally going to  end up a multi cross over but will probably not have anymore cross  over elements as instead of using Iczer One I'll be using Nova now.</p><p><b>TheCentauress:</b>  He'll get it and more before he is finally taken care of. Thanks  for your vote and that would be a great idea with the ability to talk  to cats. I kind of like Scenrio 2 a little better than the first 1  because if I bring Ranma I wanted him strong enough to take on Happi  and the learning from the big cats is a good idea, thanks.</p><p><b>Ebona Nite:</b>  Thanks, as for the Ranma/Ranko/Akane issue, the reason for bringing  Ranma in is a little more Happi related. I wanted someone to help  Cologne train the others to fight Happi and then later Herb if he  comes into play. Then again, it would be much simpler to forget about  Happi altogether and if Herb comes in, maybe have them help find the  kettle. Thank you very much, I hope it will and everybody likes it.</p><p><b>Stormdragon1:</b>  Well, yours is a good idea so I guess with the idea from the AN in  this chapter that makes five to choose from now. I like your ideas  though with the old woman and the techniques and gifts from Bast,  thanks.</p><p><b>Darkman v3:</b>  Thanks for your vote.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b>  Thanks, sorry about that though, I don't know a whole lot of his  past but I wanted to have something like that in here. Thanks on the  info on their power sources and The Firey will be the last card  caught. Either the Twin or the Song will be next. It did help very  much, thanks.</p><p><b>Firehedgehog:</b>  Thanks, I will.</p><p><b>Lov3the3vil:</b>  Thanks, he may not appear and scenario three may happen, also there's  a new choice now though with the curse becoming Bakura's body.  Thanks, next chapter or two I might list all the possible pairings  with everyone and ask for feedback on what everyone thinks about  them.</p><p><b>Borg rabbit:</b>  Thanks, I would feel sorry about Kasumi too. Maybe later she could be  granted a wish to and since she didn't die follow Ranma to this  dimension in her own body to be with him since you do have a point, I  don't much like leaving her behind either after I think about it  some, thank you.</p><p><b>Darkman v3:</b>  Thanks for the vote, the next chapter will contain what path is  taken.</p><p>Wow, over 200 reviews,  I still can't believe I got this many. I know I'm not a very good  author, I've seen so many people who is much much better and  knowing that there are so many people who actually do read this and  like it makes me very happy. Thank you everyone.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
