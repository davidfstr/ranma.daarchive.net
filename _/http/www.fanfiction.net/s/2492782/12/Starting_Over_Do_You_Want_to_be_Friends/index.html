</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting  Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 12</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by  Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½  created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card  Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't  own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>Nodoka couldn't help  looking in on the children as the sat around the table doing homework  that Ms. Mackenzie brought them, even Ranko. Ms. Mackenzie agreed to  tutor them and to set up a date for finals which relieved Nodoka. Ms.  Mackenzie was looking over Ranko's shoulder who was also working  hard also relieved her, this was probably something that Ranko needed  to take her mind of off of things for awhile.</p><p>"Are you okay,  Nodoka?" Soun asked, startling her a little. Turning around she  found the worried face of Soun Tendo who also must have been checking  up on his daughters Akane and Nabiki since Kasumi still hasn't made  it back yet.</p><p>"I'm just worried  about my daughter." Nodoka said, "She's my entire world."</p><p>"I understand how you  feel, Nodoka. My daughters mean so much to me but I failed them when  I couldn't get over my grief for Kimiko." Soun said, "I intend  to do what I can to fix everything…its time I moved on."</p><p>"I'm glad for you,  Soun." Nodoka said, leaning back into the wall near the door. "You  have very wonderful daughters."</p><p>"So do you, Nodoka.  Ranko must be very strong to have hidden everything as long as she  did." Soun said.</p><p>"She is Soun…but  she needs to stop trying to be so strong though. This is tearing her  up inside, Soun and I'm scared. Sometimes she seems like everything  is okay and then today…the way she broke down…what id it gets  worse and she tries to kill herself or something?"</p><p>"She won't,  Nodoka." Soun said wrapping his arms around her as she started  crying, "You will make sure she doesn't as will I…that is if  you let me help you."</p><p>"Thanks Soun…I  could use all of the help I can get." Nodoka said as she leaned  into his embrace. "Will you and your daughters stay for while…even  after your home is fixed? Ranko…I think she needs you all right  now."</p><p>"If you're sure,  Nodoka." Soun said, "But I insist on helping around here."</p><p>"I want to take care  of all of that Soun, partly to pay you back for taking care of my  daughter." Nodoka said.</p><p>"I don't want to  freeload, Nodoka…" Soun said.</p><p>"You aren't, Soun."  Nodoka said, "But if you still insist on doing something just help  with Ranko and…and hold me for just a bit longer…please…"</p><p>"Sure." Soun said  as he stroked Nodoka's hair.</p><p>"Thank you…I'm  just so scared right now, Soun." Nodoka cried, "I'm scared of  losing Ranko again…Genma, he escaped and I don't even know  whether to tell Ranko or not…"</p><p>"Don't tell her,  Nodoka." Soun said, "We will make sure someone is always around  her if she goes out."</p><p>"Thank you, Soun."  Nodoka said as she pulled away and wiped the tears from her eyes.</p><p>"You are most  welcome, Nodoka." Soun said, "I'm sorry for allowing this to  happen though."</p><p>"It wasn't your  fault, Soun." Nodoka said, "Genma…he fooled me too…and so  many people. I found out he had two other wives beside me, Soun…Genma  has done so many horrible things to so many people. He deserves to  pay."</p><p>"I should of known  something was up with Genma…when we trained under…him…Genma was  the one who delighted in all of the training exercises, all of HIS  more disgusting habits." Soun said.</p><p>"Soun…do you think  Genma ever cared about Ranko or me…or do you think he always  planned on this?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I wish I could  answer that, Nodoka. I never believed he was capable of something  like this, no matter how much alike to HIM he was." Soun said.</p><p>"Thank you, Soun."  Nodoka said.</p><p>"You are welcome,  Nodoka." Soun said, "In my opinion…Genma was a fool…giving up  such a beautiful and loving wife and a wonderful and equally  beautiful daughter for nothing."</p><p>"Th-thanks." Nodoka  said, her cheeks burning a little.</p><p>"Okay, that's  enough for today everyone." Ms. Mackenzie said, "Ranko, I was  hoping that maybe you could walk me out so we could talk a few  minutes?"</p><p>"Sure." Ranko said,  wondering what this was about. She watched as everyone said good bye  then walked with the woman out of the room and outside. As they  walked down the walk Ms. Mackenzie slowed their pace down a lot.</p><p>"Ranko…you are a  very smart girl." Ms. Mackenzie said, "But you need to realize  you aren't alone anymore, you have friends and family who surround  you with love and truly want to help you."</p><p>"Great…someone else  who knows…" Ranko sighed, avoiding looking at the woman.</p><p>"I know about a lot  of things and that deep, sad look in your eyes tells a lot. And they  way your mother and friends surround you protectively helps to."  Ms. Mackenzie said, "You need to accept others help, Ranko…Both  for your health and for your extra curricular activities. Your family  and friends support will help a lot in that as well as help you get  over your troubles. Both are a long road though but I have faith in  you."</p><p>"What do you mean  about extra curricular activities?" Ranko asked in surprise. Did  she know about the cards? Who could have told her though?</p><p>"Here's my car."  Ms. Mackenzie said, "I have to be going but I'll see you  tomorrow. Please remember what I said, we all care about you Ranko."</p><p>"Yeah…thanks Ms.  Mackenzie." Ranko said.</p><p>"Ranko, I want to  talk with you." Li said as came up to her as Ms. Mackenzie pulled  off, "Alone."</p><p>"I-I'm not sure…"  Ranko said.</p><p>"It's about the  cards and a few other things." Li said.</p><p>"I guess it'd be  okay." Ranko said as she walked with Li in silence for a few  minutes until they came to a park and reached what looked like a  relatively secluded area. She was really nervous, Li seemed so angry  and it was scaring her.</p><p>"Why did you lie to  me, Ranma?" Li demanded as he spun around to face Ranko. Ranko  couldn't look him in the eyes, he didn't know yet about the truth  and must have heard about the curse in school though he heard about  what Ranko was forced to tell, not the truth. "You're name isn't  even Ranko…I won't have some dishonorable filth handling my  family's sacred treasure! I want the CARDS returned to me, Ranma!"</p><p>"No…" Ranko said,  "I never lied to you…my name is Ranko…I was cursed at the hot  springs…"</p><p>"If that's true  then you are a girl, but then why does everyone say that you and your  father was cursed at the training grounds?" Li demanded, "You're  lying to me again, anyone with half a brain would avoid the training  grounds if they was cursed all ready at another place with the same  name! I want the cards, Ranko…Ranma…or whatever your name is, if  you don't give them to me I'll take them by force."</p><p>"Sorry brat, but she  belongs to me." Genma said appearing out of no where. Ranko backed  up shaking her head as he became visible. "Maybe if there is  anything left of the little whore when I get done you can have your  fun."</p><p>Yuka and Sayuri was  walking in the park after school had ended, both wondering why none  of the Tendo's, Ranma or Kuno was at school that day. "Hey,  Sayuri, isn't that Li with Ranma?" Yuka asked.</p><p>"Yeah…but what are  they doing?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"One way to find  out." Sayuri said.</p><p>"Let's  spy…err…follow them." Yuka and Sayuri said together.</p><p>The two followed them  until Li and Ranko stopped so Sayuri and Yuka hid behind some bushes  where the could easily see and hear everything. Yuka couldn't  understand why Ranma looked so scared though then they heard  something that turned their world upside down…Ranma was claiming to  be a girl named Ranko…which, she figured would explain the skirt  but Ranma had done stuff like this before though.</p><p>Yuka almost screamed  when Genma appeared out of no where like a ghost or something.</p><p>"Sorry brat, but she  belongs to me." Genma said appearing out of no where. Ranko backed  up shaking her head as he became visible. "Maybe if there is  anything left of the little whore when I get done you can have your  fun."</p><p>Yuka watched Ranma's  reaction in disbelief, instead of fighting Genma Ranma backed into a  tree shaking her head as Genma approached her. Ranma slid down to the  ground crying in what looked like fear.</p><p>"You can't escape  me you little whore, you ruined all of my plans. All you had to do  was pretend to be Ranma, you little piece of trash!" Genma growled,  "But you couldn't even do that. How hard is it to pretend to be a  boy, huh?"</p><p>Yuka cringed as Genma  slapped Ranma across the face.</p><p>"Leave her alone!"  Li demanded.</p><p>"And you are going to  make me?" Genma laughed as he turned around while Li pulled a small  gong out of his robes.</p><p>"Of course." Li  said with a smirk as the gong changed into a sword then he pulled out  a small scroll and held it in front of the sword which he was holding  in front of him horizontally. "Last chance."</p><p>"Pathetic." Genma  said, "I'll take care of you then I'll take care of my  worthless daughter."</p><p>"Your choice." Li  said, "Force know my plight, release the LIGHT! LIGHTNING!"</p><p>An explosion of  lightning shot into Genma and flung his charred body through the sky.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Li  asked walking over to the red head.</p><p>"NO!" Ranko cried,  pulling her knees up and hiding her face in them as she hugged them  tight. "Please…not again…please…"</p><p>Yuka was out of the  bush and to Ranko's side immediately. "Ranko…It's me…Yuka."  Yuka said softly as she sat next to the sobbing Ranko, touching the  other girls shoulder softly.</p><p>"Yuka?" Ranko  sniffed.</p><p>"Yeah, Yuka." Yuka  said pulling the red head into a hug, "Its okay, Li got rid of  Genma, he won't hurt you now."</p><p>"Stop…please  stop…I'm a dirty perverted…freak…" Ranko cried as she broke  down in sobs.</p><p>"Is she okay?" Li  asked, obviously uncomfortable.</p><p>"I don't know."  Sayuri said as she sat down next two the other two girls and rubbed  the red heads back, mouthing "Akane." To Yuka who nodded.  Whatever happened to Ranma…Ranko…the beatings Akane gave her  didn't help any.</p><p>"We need to get her  back to the dojo." Sayuri said.</p><p>"No, we should take  her to see Tofu." Yuka said, "Genma hit her pretty hard."</p><p>"Ranko, are you  okay?" Sayuri asked but her only response was a loud sob.</p><p>"I-I'll carry her."  Li said.</p><p>"If you do anything  to her, I swear I'll…" Yuka started but was cut off by Li.</p><p>"I won't, I  promise." Li said as he bent down and lifted Ranko from Yuka and  held her bridal style as she buried her face in the crook of his neck  and cried.</p><p>Li stood still for a  minute as the girl in his arms cried, he knew just a few minutes ago  he was furious at her for something he believed she lied about. The  question he had now…did she lie to him about being Ranko or not? He  was sure she was telling the truth, her very own father even admitted  it in his assault.</p><p>At that thought Li  growled, he would find that man again, the one who hurt Ranko and  make him pay dearly. "Where is this Tofu's anyways?"</p><p>"Follow us." Yuka  said as Sayuri and she walked ahead of Li a little bit as they kept  looking back on Li and Ranko.</p><p>"Why are you helping  me?" Ranko sniffed, "I'm dishonorable f-filth?"</p><p>"No you aren't."  Li said, "I-I overreacted and I'm sorry. I thought you were  playing games with me."</p><p>"Doesn't matter  a-anyways, Li…I'm still a w-worthless piece of trash." Ranko  cried.</p><p>"No you aren't,  Ranko." Li said, kissing the top of her head. He wasn't sure why  he did that but it scared Ranko for a second then actually caused her  to calm down. A few minutes later her could feel her breathing even  out as she fell asleep.</p><p>Li sighed inwardly, he  had messed up bad and he was starting to realize it. He was sent here  to find his family's sacred treasure, the Book of Clow and return  it. In the process though he met a girl who actually proved that love  at first sight is a possibility. The instant he saw her and looked in  her deep blue eyes, he was sure he was in love with her, it was as if  something just clicked. But he pushed it aside and decided to follow  what was expected of him from his family.</p><p>He was to marry Mei  Lin, it was prearranged by their families though neither one wanted  it. Still, it was his duty to marry her and bring back the cards, he  didn't have time for love so he demanded the cards and actually  expected Ranko to comply. He was to say the least shocked when she  brushed him off and actually showed an exceptional mastery in the  martial arts which was probably even better than his own.</p><p>He spent that night  laying awake and thinking about those eyes and decided to try and  make up with the girl and get to know her. When they meet at school  he didn't even know it, he thought it may have been her brother.  Then after he got the chance to find her at lunch and apologize they  went back to class. There Ranko was now sitting in Ranma's seat  which confused him. One of his neighbors explained to him about the  curse which really made him made. Li felt Ranko…or Ranma had made a  fool out of him.</p><p>Li knew about Jusenkyo,  he had to study a lot about magical places as he grew up and was  trained in the arts, both mystical and martial. He didn't have a  problem about Ranko being Ranma and he wasn't really sure what hurt  worse, the fact that he was lied to or the fact that he felt like his  heart shattered into a million pieces.</p><p>Now though he was  carrying that same person in his arms and it turned out that Ranko  really was a girl and hadn't betrayed him. But the way he treated  her earlier, he didn't deserve to have her ever speak to him again.  "Forget the family and the cards…" Li whispered to himself,  "Ranko is more important than those bunch of stuck up bastards  anyways."</p><p>"Thank you, Li…"  Ranko whispered, sleepily.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Li  asked as the group stopped outside of a small clinic.</p><p>"I don't know, Li…"  Ranko whispered, "I'm never going to escape from him, am I? I  don't want to be beaten again…I don't want to be r-raped again.  I'm s-scared."</p><p>"RANKO!" a brown  haired girl called from the doorway to the clinic where she stood  with a man with glasses that sent shivers down Li's spine. They  both hurried over to the group and asked what happened. A quick  explanation later found Li ushered inside with his precious cargo.</p><p>"Bring her back here  to the examination room." Tofu said. "Kasumi, would you please  call the others and tell them that Ranko is here with us then come  help me with her?"</p><p>"Y-Yeah Doctor."  Kasumi said, her voice lined with worry.</p><p>Ranko sat in the  waiting room with Kasumi and Tofu after her examination and everyone  else was sent home. She hated having to talk about what happened to  the Doctor but Kasumi had all ready explained most of it to him.</p><p>"So, was that your  boyfriend?" Tofu asked with a soft smile.</p><p>"No…who'd want to  be with someone like me anyway…no one wants to be around a whore."  Ranko whispered.</p><p>"Ranko, you aren't  a whore." Kasumi said as she moved closer to Ranko and hugged her  for a few moments. "What your father did…he had no right. You  couldn't stop him but that doesn't mean you're worthless or  anything like that."</p><p>"She's right."  Tofu said sitting on Ranko's other side, "Do you know what I see  when I look at you?"</p><p>"N-No." Ranko  whispered.</p><p>"A very attractive,  beautiful young woman." Tofu said, "Now do you now what I think  about you since I know you and know what happened?"</p><p>"You thing I'm  trash?" Ranko asked, not looking at him. She felt Tofu's finger  under her chin as he guided her head up to look into his eyes.</p><p>"No, I do not,  Ranko." Tofu said, his eyes and expressions giving no signs of  lies, "I see a very intelligent young woman who is a master martial  artist. A girl who has been hurt badly, yes, but I do not see a  whore. You had no control over what happened to you. You are not  worthless, but a very important young woman who has many people that  care about very much."</p><p>"Do you mean it?"  Ranko asked, unable to tear her gaze away but she felt tears  threatening to spill.</p><p>"I mean every word,  Ranko." Tofu assured her, "If I ever have a daughter, I hope she  turns out to be as wonderful a girl as you are."</p><p>"Th-thank you."  Ranko said, tears falling freely now.</p><p>"You are very  welcome, dear, and I mean it." Tofu said, pulling a tissue from a  box off of the table and drying her tears.</p><p>Ranko didn't know why  but she was still crying even though she wasn't as depressed as she  was earlier. Tofu…she couldn't describe it but his words, they  seemed to make her feel so much better than she has for a long while.  They were so calm and soothing, carrying the assurance of truth.  Maybe if he didn't think there was anything wrong with her maybe  she was getting all worked up over nothing?</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, sorry  if this chapter seems a little messed up. I kept getting interrupted  every few minutes writing it but I did go back and try to fix things  several times. It's hard to write when your mother is doting on you  all day because of a broken leg. Ranko is going to start feeling a  little better about herself now but is she recovered completely, I'm  sorry to say she's probably not. As for why Tofu's words affected  her and why he's not so hysterical around Kasumi? All I can say for  now is that he has gotten stronger lately but for a better  explanation will have to wait a bit but it will be revealed when  Ranko catches all of the cards. Speaking of cards, here is the list  of cards that she has caught so far:</p><p>The  Windy</p><p>The  Shadow</p><p>The Jump</p><p>The  Dream</p><p>The Erase</p><p>The  Watery</p><p>The Create</p><p>The  Power</p><p>The Glow</p><p>The Cloud</p><p>The Fly</p><p>The Voice</p><p>The Change</p><p>The Mist</p><p>The  Freeze</p><p>The Snow</p><p>The Thunder</p><p>The Rain</p><p>The  Illusion</p><p>The  Sleep</p><p>The Silent</p><p>The  Earthy</p><p>The Sweet</p><p>The Time</p><p>The Shot</p><p>The Sword</p><p>The  Through</p><p>The Loop</p><p>The Lock</p><p>The Libra</p><p>The Sand</p><p>The Fight</p><p>The  Big</p><p>The Arrow</p><p>The Move</p><p>The Wave</p><p>The  Bubbles</p><p>The  Float</p><p>The Return</p><p>The  Mirror</p><p>The  Storm</p><p>The Flower</p><p>The Little</p><p>The Wood</p><p>And of course here is  the cards she has left to capture:</p><p>The Twin</p><p>The Firey</p><p>The  Song</p><p>The Dark</p><p>The Light</p><p>The Dash</p><p>The Shield</p><p>The Maze</p><p>I'm  not sure what The  Light and The Dark do exactly so anyone who does know a detail  description of what they do, or did when Sakura caught them I would  be happy if you would send it to me. Thank you. (After I uploaded the  chapter I checked to see if the cards stayed in their neat little  columns I had set up and sadly the didn't so I had to list them like  this to be able to make them easily readable. Sorry about that.)</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> I'm  glad there wasn't, my spell checker must have been in a good mood.  Thanks.</p><p><b>Shinigami:</b> The  amazons and Kodachi both will be coming up shortly and as for Nodoka  being mad, well if anyone attacks her daughter she will be for sure  and she has the resources to do something about any of them to so  yep, Shampoo could cause them a lot of trouble if she tries to  enforce the kiss of marriage.</p><p><b>Reaper2040:</b> I do  have the clow book and cards but I'm not sure to what the Light and  Dark cards did in the anime or series or how they was caught, so any  help there would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you could help with  how Yue first appeared and about the trials in the judgment, that  would be a great help to. Thank you very much.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b>  Thanks and don't worry, Ranko I'm sure will have a happy ending.  As for that story, if it's the one I'm thinking about (Juuban  Incident) I liked the story but I cried when Pluto did that. Pluto  and Saturn are two of my favorite senshi but in that story I couldn't  help but hating her for what she did.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b>  Thanks, the sword card fighting Tatewaki is a great idea. I finally  figured out how to bring Kodachi into the story now which will be  soon as well but I'm still a little fuzzy on what to do with the  Amazons.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> Thank  you, as for Tatewaki's normal condition, that will be explained  more as soon as Kodachi is introduced. As for new characters from a  rape support group, it's a good idea, thank you. I'm not too sure  what to do about the reviews though, I want to make sure everyone who  reviews knows that I read their review and appreciate it. Maybe if I  try and cut them down a little or something, I'll try and think of  something by the next chapter, thank you.</p><p><b>Lerris:</b> Well, I  do agree with you on the part about the cannon Genma seeming to be a  better person but as for making Genma or any other character evil in  a fanfic a lazy way of developing a plot, that I really can't agree  with a whole lot. I believe that if a fanfic author doesn't change  some characters in their stories at times all fanfics would be to  much like Cannon and follow their storyline which pretty much defeats  the purpose of fanfiction. Its those changes that make new stories  even better by making them new and hopefully somewhat original.</p><p><b>Lerris:</b> Many  character truly do get that kind of treatment but again I believe  that's what makes fanfiction all the more refreshing. It's all  about the what ifs of what the story is based around such as Ranma,  Card Captor Sakura, Sailor Moon, Magic Knight Rayearth, ect.</p><p><b>Borg rabbit:</b>  Yep, and not only him but Ryoga will likely be his competition for  Ranko's heart. As for Genma, he will show up again, what Li did to  him in this chapter won't stop him that easily.</p><p><b>Lerris:</b> Thanks,  I'll try to avoid making things seem to convenient though.</p><p><b>Ray:</b> Thanks very  much, I'm happy that you like it that much.</p><p><b>Tenchi Saotome:</b>  Thank you but don't worry, I will be finishing this one and likely  make both a sequel and prequel now.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b>  She will, though right now she is feeling better thanks to Tofu but  it won't last forever. As for Yue, that's a good idea, thanks.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> That's  a good question and I'm not really too sure yet, but a very good  possibility it would be the kiss of death, thanks.</p><p><b>Isumo 1489:</b>  Thanks, and Ranko could use all of the friends and help she can get.  As for the final judge, I have it narrowed down to two people who are  both naturally very kind. The only problem is one is female and the  other male. The male would be the most likely candidate but a female  version of Yue would also be different though not many people may  like that a whole lot. As for Genma dying from a clow card, all  things are possible. Li was angry at first because he believed Ranko  was a boy and was playing games but he knows the truth now and there  will be more field support when the amazons come in but it won't be  one of them.</p><p><b>DigiSim:</b> I'm  not to sure if there will be a Nabiki/Tatewaki pairing but there will  be a friendship between them.</p><p><b>Ss4-link:</b> Yes,  Li and Ryoga might certainly will become competition for Ranko's  heart, thanks.</p><p>Thanks to all of you  who have read this and enjoyed it and thank you to everyone who has  reviewed.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne.</p>
