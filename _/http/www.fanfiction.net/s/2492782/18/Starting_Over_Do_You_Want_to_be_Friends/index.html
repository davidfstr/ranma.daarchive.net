</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 18</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>Nodoka watched as everyone sat in front of the television in the living room watching, what she suspected due to the was she was dressed and the out of focus yellow splotch in the picture a time or two was edited video footage of the night before. She was very proud of her daughter and what she did to that bastard. She was now hoping beyond hope that the fool would crawl off somewhere and die.</p><p>"Wow, Ranko, that was great!" Akane said.</p><p>"It was cousin." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Oh my, I hope it's worse than it looks." Kasumi said drawing everyone's attention for a moment, "What? I hope he burns in hell after what he did to Ranko."</p><p>That was the first time Nodoka heard anything like that come out of the girl's mouth and judging from everyone else's reactions it probably never really happened before. When Soun came to sit next to Nodoka and took her hand she smiled at him and leaned into him a little. He had really been very supportive of her since he came here with his daughters and she didn't even want him to leave or the girl's she was coming to think of as her own.</p><p>"I'm just glad it's over." Ranko said as she stood up.</p><p>And Nodoka was sure that it was because after she found out about it she had called Kyo and had him go investigate the area. They found a panda that seemed very weak and not very smart with four large gash wounds across the front of it. She had told him to pour hot water over it and he did but it stayed a panda. They had shipped it off to the local zoo for treatment and quarantine.</p><p>"I can't wait until today is over with." Nabiki said, stretching, "I want to get the finals over with."</p><p>"Me to, then we can truly kick back and enjoy summer." Akane agreed.</p><p>"I've already called Ms. Mackenzie Kodachi, she will have your finals sent from your school seeing how you've not been feeling well. If you feel ready for them you can go with the others." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Thanks Auntie, I will." Kodachi said with a gleam in her eyes, "I was hoping to take care of some things before we left like taking care of this red haired harridan."</p><p>"Any time you want." Ranko said bouncing to her feet.</p><p>"Hey!" Nodoka gasped.</p><p>"You won't beat me this time, I learned a new combo!" Kodachi laughed.</p><p>"Feh, like you can actually beat me with that goofy looking…whatever it is." Ranko laughed, not paying much attention to the strange looks they were receiving. "Kenshin always comes out on top!"</p><p>"But of course, dear cousin." Kodachi said, "For I, the black rose shall defeat you this time thanks to the new game site I found."</p><p>"Hey! That's cheating looking up cheat sites!" Ranko cried indignantly.</p><p>"No, that infernal game device you used this morning to make yourself invulnerable was cheating." Kodachi said.</p><p>"It was only a joke." Ranko said.</p><p>"Well this time I won't lose." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Ummm…what's going on?" Nodoka asked thoroughly confused.</p><p>"They're talking about that fighting game." Nabiki said.</p><p>"O-Okay…" Nodoka said, "I was a little worried."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Auntie/Mother." Ranko and Kodachi said at the same time.</p><p>"It's okay dears," Nodoka said, "Just make sure everyone who is going to the school is ready an hour before we leave."</p><p>"Okay." Came a chorus of replies.</p><p>"Good morning, child." Cologne said as Ryou entered the main part of the restaurant.</p><p>"Good morning, Cologne." Bakura grumbled at the cheery morning person. After last night Cologne offered Bakura a place to stay for awhile in exchange for running evening deliveries on the weekends on his bike. Of course Ryou would be the one doing it though since Bakura refused to.</p><p>"So what plans have you made for today, child?" Cologne asked.</p><p>"I'm going to hunt for a Kitten." Bakura said with a smile, "I want to check up on her."</p><p>"I take it your talking about Ranko?" Cologne asked, "Don't let her hear you call her that, she's deathly afraid of cats thanks to that fool's idea of training."</p><p>"Why is she afraid of cats?" Bakura asked angrily, "She's Bast's chosen and she didn't really act scared."</p><p>"The neko-ken…" Cologne asked.</p><p>"What kind of idiot would teach a child that stupid ass technique?" Bakura demanded the calmed down, he knew who. "Don't answer that…"</p><p>"I know of the neko-ken and how dangerous it is but I'm afraid not much more." Cologne said.</p><p>"That's fine, I know plenty enough." Bakura said. "I killed the bastard who created it."</p><p>"What!" Cologne asked shocked.</p><p>"Sit down old woman and I'll tell you." Bakura said angrily as he took a chair himself, turned it around backwards to sit in and crossed his arms over the back. "Back in ancient Egypt the gods walked the earth much more often than they did now and often times Bast would find women who was strong and worthy of her gifts. Those women became Bast's avatars and given great abilities that made the women stronger and faster, more feline like. They were the Goddess's chosen but only women ever received her gifts. Some fool man wanted those powers for himself and took many Mau cats which was the Goddess's messengers and starved them in a pit in the ground. No one in their right minds though would kill one of the Mau though in fear of Bast's vengeance."</p><p>"I remember reading something about that in our histories, some of our ancestors were of Bast's chosen warriors." Cologne said.</p><p>"Perhaps, it is possible." Bakura said, "Even the man didn't want to kill one of the Mau but he figured that it was the only way. A Mau's power, after being killed lingers for a few minutes and sometimes can be absorbed by others. That was why the pit with the cats, he didn't want to risk the goddess's wrath until he was sure it would work so he kidnapped a young child and wrapped him up in fish caught from the Nile and threw him into the pits. His theory was that the child's basic survival instincts would kick in after awhile and they did. The child slaughtered many of the Mau and absorbed their abilities and power but it drove the poor child insane and broke free. The child was killed when he attacked some city guards which also had a couple of Bast's chosen. One of them was my promised and was killed. I hunted the bastard down and killed him and destroyed all of the notes he made but he must have made copies and gave them out to other fools. I managed to track a few down and kill them as well but it was never enough to completely stop the neko-ken or to bring back my beloved."</p><p>"I'm sorry, child." Cologne said.</p><p>"She meant a lot to me and I still have a place in my heart for her but I have moved on." Bakura said, "And incidentally, tell anyone that I have a heart and I may be forced to kill you."</p><p>"Don't worry child, I won't." Cologne chuckled.</p><p>"Thank you but now I have a lot to think about before I can find my Kitten." Bakura said, "I'll be in my room."</p><p>Ranko walked up to the Furinkan gates with Nodoka by her side along with Kodachi, Tatewaki had also shown up and came along as well and Nabiki and Akane. Before they could pass through the gates though the idiot principal came from the other side.</p><p>"Aloha, and where do you all thing ye be going now?" the principal asked, "You all dis expelled for de skipping of de classes."</p><p>"WHAT!" Nodoka growled in rage as she grabbed the idiot by the collar.</p><p>"You be hearing the big kahuna." The principal said. "Expelled."</p><p>"Listen here you reject, I called and had everything set up. You screw with me and I'll throw you out of the clan so fast." Nodoka growled as she shook the principal hard causing his head to shake back and forth before she dropped him.</p><p>"They do de crime, they do de time." The principal said.</p><p>"Here." Nodoka said dropping a piece of paper on to the principal's lap.</p><p>"Y-You can't do this…what about me kids." The principal asked.</p><p>"First of all, your kids are no longer your concern as if you even cared. They are being moved under me as my children. Second, you little bag of crap, you have twenty-four hours to vacate the Kuno estate or I will send my brother's guards to remove you." Nodoka said, "And as well, since you no longer bear the Kuno's name, the school board is no longer scared of you as Mrs. Aiashi told me late last night over the phone. She will also be here today to remove you from the school grounds and name me as acting principal."</p><p>"H-How dare you!" the principal roared as he rushed Nodoka but a ribbon wrapped itself around his feet and pulled him off balance making him hit the ground hard.</p><p>"I'm afraid I can not allow you to hurt my mother." Kodachi said with a smirk.</p><p>"Nor can I." Tatewaki said pointing his bokken at the principal.</p><p>"Or can I." Ranko said cracking her knuckles.</p><p>"Mommy…" the principal whimpered as three very powerful martial artist advanced on the foolish man leaving a battered and bruised lump behind.</p><p>"You knew this was going to happen, didn't you?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Of course, dear." Nodoka said, "The man is an idiot and very predictable."</p><p>"Wow, I never thought I'd see the day those three would work together." Akane said.</p><p>"We better get inside and meet Ms. Mackenzie and get your finals finished." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Then summer here we come." Ranko said.</p><p>AN: Sorry this chapter is so short but I need a little input before I continue on the next. I have several scenarios after the review responses that I have worked out for the next chapter and I'd like to see which one everyone liked the most. Please check them out and tell me what you think of them and which one is the best. Thanks.</p><p>Review Responses.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b> Thanks, and I agree that Genma does show signs of caring I guess but as you said he is one of the easiest to vilify. Genma's just isn't one of my fave characters especially since the way he treats Ranma.I will, and thanks for the support.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> In a way he did I guess and in a way he didn't. For the rest of eternity he will experience everything that he ever did to Ranko repeatedly. Being beaten, dropped in the pits of cats, being forced to do what he made Ranko and it will never end for him. They would definitely help Ranko and they will definitely grow closer together as friends. As for Mousse's curse, I think him and Shampoo will both be cured sometime soon in the future and may even end up with a new pet apiece. Ranko did access the Neko-Ken and will be able to again, I just haven't decided on how yet.</p><p><b>Darkepyon:</b> Thanks, but depending on how I do it, it will be possible. Please read the scenarios after the responses and let me know which one you think would be the best one.</p><p><b>Staren:</b> Thanks, and you are right, I guess it would have been possible but I wanted to make a good CCS cross over and I'm hoping everyone will continue enjoying this one. Sorry about that, I try to use by spell/grammar checker but it always seems to give me problems catching everything.</p><p><b>TheCentauress:</b> Thanks, I hope this was pretty good for getting the principal out of the picture though it won't be the last of him. He will be humiliated a few more times before the point is pounded into his coconut head.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> Thanks, sorry about how easy Kodachi took it. And thank you for telling me about the section breaks. I did have them three times now but the keep disappearing on me when I upload I guess. The first chapter started with like a cat face emoticon. Then when I realized they were not working I tried like a curvy type of line. Now I'm using just a regular line and I hope it works this time. Sorry about the fight seeming rushed, I am not very well at doing fight scenes, I'm still trying to learn how to do them better.</p><p><b>Ebona Nite:</b> Thanks, and she will before that happens.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> Thanks, I wanted Genma to experience the pain that he inflicted on Ranko but I also wanted an original way of doing it.</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> Thanks, I want to get them as soon as they do. Congrats on the helicopter.</p><p><b>Den Scurman:</b> Thanks, and it was kind of. I got the cards from a game boy game I borrowed off of my cousin so I hope they were okay. Yep, all new types of chaos are bound to happen, especially in the sequel. As for Bakura, Shampoo really hasn't met him yet but she will soon since he will be staying there for awhile. Ukyo will come around but as you said she is having a bit of a hard time with this. How does everyone feel about Ranko gaining even another sister in Ukyo? Yep though Shampoo and Cologne don't know her really though Meilin knows them from everything Mousse told her. Yep, she did and will be able to again when she masters it, thank you.</p><p><b>Borg rabbit: </b>Well, he would if I just plainly split them but I have an idea on how to make a cannon Ranma that is in the scenarios after the reviews. Please read them and see which one you think is the best and let me know, thanks.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b> Thanks, and that is a good idea with Li. Thanks for the info on how the judgment is initiated. That helps keep me from messing up and doing it during the day which I was thinking about. I'm glad that you like Meilin but there are starting to be a lot of characters so in the sequel I'm thinking of having each chapter in a different characters point of view for the whole chapter and switching for the next one. What do you think?</p><p><b>Shinigami:</b> She does and that may happen giving the CCS crew a more cannon pairing. I'm glad you liked the Bakura revenge and as for who's who, Bakura is the yami. And thanks for the spelling, sorry that I misspelled it.</p><p><u>Scenarios:</u></p><p><b>Scenario 1:</b></p><p>In an alternate universe Kasumi sits alone in a hospital room sitting next to Ranma who was put in a coma after her foolish sister hit him too hard with that stupid mallet. She hated her family for the way they acted too laming Ranma for it and not even coming to see him.</p><p>"Hello Kasumi." A woman said. She had long golden brown hair and some strange tattoos under each eye and on her forehead. "My name is Belledandy."</p><p>"Are you a friend of Ranma?" Kasumi asked, surprised at how hoarse her voice sounded from the hours of crying.</p><p>"I'm sorry but I'm not." Belledandy said as she reached her hand out and touched Ranma's forehead, both glowing for a moment.</p><p>"Wh-what happened?" Ranma asked weakly from the bed.</p><p>"Hello Ranma Saotome, I am the goddess Belledandy and I'm sorry to say that you are dying." Belledandy said.</p><p>"Y-You came to take him away?" Kasumi cried.</p><p>"No, Kasumi." Belledandy said. "I came to grant Ranma one wish."</p><p>"A wish, huh?" Ranma asked sarcastically, "All right then…I wish I had friends and family who really cared about me…"</p><p>Belledandy's eyes closed as the tattoos glowed brightly before she whispered, "Wish granted."</p><p>Kasumi let out a sob as Ranma's eyes closed and the monitor next to the bed flat lined.</p><p>Ranko looked at the cat who just became a woman with cat like features, though still a little afraid she was no longer terrified. "Hello, Ranko."</p><p>"Wh-Who are you?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"I am the Goddess Bast and I came here to repair the damage done to you from the neko-ken." Bast said, "You will still have my gifts but you no longer need to fear cats."</p><p>"H-How?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"By separating the vengeful cat spirit from you and leaving the abilities that my true chosen all have." Bast said extending her arm, "And since no male may have my gifts I also intend to remove your curse as well."</p><p>Ranko closed her eyes as she felt something being pulled out from inside of her.</p><p>"What the?" Bast asked in shock.</p><p>"What the hell?" a boy cried out.</p><p>"Who are you?" Bast demanded.</p><p>"Ranma Saotome, sorry about this."</p><p>In this scenario, Ranko will have the ability to control the cat fist but not Ranma but Ranma has all of his abilities up to the Moku Takabisha (sorry, I can't remember the right spelling at the moment.).</p><p><b>Scenario 2:</b></p><p>Ranma sat on the roof of the dojo, for once not caring that tears was falling from freely nor who saw them. He was dressed in a burnt and tore tuxedo which was damaged during the failed wedding that just took place a few short hours ago.</p><p>As usual everything was blamed and pushed off onto him as they told him how worthless he was. He was a perverted fiancé, a worthless son, a dishonorable son, a cheating bastard…the list went on and on.</p><p>"Why can't I have a family that actually gives a damn about me?" Ranma sighed, "I wish I did."</p><p>"Wish granted." A soft voice said from behind him.</p><p>Nodoka watched in horror as her daughter fell to the ground clutching her head as if she was in pain. There was a quick flash of light and after it cleared there was both Ranko and her cursed side lying on the floor.</p><p>"Where the hell?" the boy asked confused as he sat up.</p><p>"Who are you?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I guess you want to disown me then!" the boy snapped, "Fine…I don't care anymore. Its better than having to deal with all of this crap."</p><p>"Huh?" Nodoka asked in confusion.</p><p>This obviously happens after the failed wedding so he will have all of his abilities plus the neko-ken which went with Ranko's cursed side. Now Ranko won't be scared of cats but she will still be able to access most of its abilities because of the changes her body had made, small as they are. Sorry, no catgirl. Both of these scenarios split Ranko's cursed side which Ranma will inhabit, both cured of Jusenkyo now.</p><p>The last scenario will just have nothing to do with another Ranma, but Bast will cure Ranko of her fears and correct the Neko-Ken and the curse. Please let me know which one everyone likes the best. Sorry if the scenario's aren't written well, it's just a rough and will be rewritten and expanded on greatly for which ever one happens. Thanks.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has reviewed and also to everyone who has read this and liked it.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
