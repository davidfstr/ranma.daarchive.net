</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 22</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>Ranko was nervous, very nervous as she waited paitiently after Kasumi helped her dress in a conservative sleeveless black silk dress that covered her completely from the collar at her neck all the way to her ankles. It did have an open back though with slits from her knees down. It had two beautiful white dragons spiraling around the length of the dress. She also wore something that for some reason no matter how good her balance was she still had trouble getting use to the three inch spiked heels. The affect, though conservative, it also showed off her curves nicely which did worry her a little. She was hoping for something a little less…tight.</p><p>"Relax, Ranko, you look gorgeous." Kasumi said, adjusting the bow in Ranko's hair which Kasumi brushed out and styled into a loose low ponytail with the ribbon holding it back, tied in a bow.</p><p>""I can't help being nervous, Kasumi." Ranko said, "Th-this is my first date…ever."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ranko." Kasumi said, "But it'll be okay. I promise. You look great."</p><p>"Ranko!" Nodoka called from downstairs, "Bakura is here."</p><p>"There he is." Ranko said nervously, a part of her wanting to just cancel the whole thing.</p><p>"Good luck, Ranma."Kasumi said, ushering Ranko out of the room, "And relax, have fun."</p><p>"I-I'll try." Ranko said as she walked very carefully down the steps, noticing her mother beaming proudly while Nabiki and Tomoyo were both taping everything. Then she saw him…Bakura. His hair was wild as all ways but he was dressed in a very dark blue suit.</p><p>"You are absolutely stunning, Kitten." Bakura said with a big smile, making Ranko blush deeply.</p><p>"Th-Thank you, Bakura…you look really nice too…" Ranko said nervously all the while hitting herself in her mind. Bakura didn't look nice, he looked…absolutely hot. Ranko felt something twitching on the top of her head and blushed even more. Her catears appeared and was twitching nervously.</p><p>"R-Ranko…?" Nodoka asked, nervously.</p><p>"I'll explain it, Ranko." Kasumi said, "Enjoy your date."</p><p>"Come on, Kitten." Bakura said, "We have reservations soon."</p><p>"Have fun dear." Nodoka called though her voice was laced with worry and something else that Ranko couldn't make out.</p><p>"Thanks mom." Ranko said nervously, "Bye everyone."</p><p>As Ranko walked next to Bakura her nervousness faded a little as she actually felt, or rather felt the lack of cat ears. She was surprised though when Bakura offered her his arm and she was even more surprised at herself when she took and leaned into him a little. The walk was a quiet one as they enjoyed each other's company and they soon arrived at the restaurant. It was a nice little restaurant with a cozy atmosphere and soft music playing and other couples sitting at various tables talking quietly among themselves.</p><p>"We have reservations for two under the name Bakura." Bakura said.</p><p>"Ah yes, your waitress will show you to your table." The snotty man behind the counter said after looking in a book.</p><p>"Hi, I'm Kagome and I'll be your waitress this evening." The girl said happily, "This way please to your table.</p><p>Ranko followed Bakura and the girl out through the floor and between a few tables until the came to a table off by itself with an excellent view out the window into the park the restaurant sat by.</p><p>"Would you like breadsticks or salad?" Kagome asked.</p><p>"Both please." Bakura said, taking a menu the girl handed him then Ranko took hers.</p><p>"And what would you like to drink?" Kagome asked.</p><p>"Would you like some wine or champagne, Ranko?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Sir but we must ask for your ID before we can serve you and alcohol." Kagome said.</p><p>"I'd rather not, Bakura." Ranko said a little sadly then hid it, she wanted to enjoy tonight not think of the past. "I'd rather have a Pepsi."</p><p>"Me to." Bakura said, "And I'm ready to order also."</p><p>"Okay." Kagome said pulling a pad and pen from her apron.</p><p>"I want the chicken alfredo." Bakura said.</p><p>"I'll take the spaghetti." Ranko said.</p><p>"Okay, that's two Pepsis, one chicken alfredo and one spaghetti. Plus breadsticks and salad." Kagome said, "I'll bring your salad, breadsticks and drinks out in a moment but your food will take a little longer."</p><p>"Thank you." Bakura said as Kagome walked away. He then reached across the table and took Ranko's right hand and squeezed it gently, "You okay, kitten."</p><p>"I'm fine, Bakura, thank you." Ranko said smiling, "Thank you so much, I love this place."</p><p>"I'm glad Kitten." Bakura said as Kagome came out sitting their drinks in front of them as well as a small salad each and a basket of breadsticks in between them.</p><p>"Thanks." Bakura and Ranko said at the same time.</p><p>"Your welcome, your food will be out shortly but if you need anything just wave." Kagome said.</p><p>"Thanks." Bakura said as Kagome walked off.</p><p>"Bakura, thank you for everything that you've done for me." Ranko said.</p><p>"You're very welcome, Kitten." Bakura said, "I know we haven't really known each other that long but you already mean more to me than you can imagine."</p><p>Ranko felt her cheeks burning as Bakura said that, he sounded like he meant it completely. It made Ranko feel so good about knowing that there was someone who knew what happened to her and would still actually want to be with her.</p><p>"Thanks, Bakura." Ranko said, fidgeting a little. "I…I was so scared before but I'm so glad I came…this has been the best night of my life…and…I really do like you…"</p><p>"Thank you, Ranko." Bakura said with a smile, "You know, you are so much better than I thought you were when we first meet. I knew then there was something special about you, and not just being one of Bast's chosen, but now…there is just so much more than I first thought. I'm in love with you, Ranko."</p><p>"Wh-What?" Ranko asked, not believing what she heard.</p><p>"I love you, Ranko." Bakura said.</p><p>"I…I…I'm sorry, Bakura." Ranko said, "I can't say it to you…I…I."</p><p>"Shhh." Bakura said, "Its okay, I know that you have been through a lot and I am more than willing to wait until you are ready to say it, no matter how long it takes."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Bakura." Ranko said.</p><p>"Don't be, Kitten." Bakura said.</p><p>"Here you go." Kagome said sitting down Ranko's plate before her and then gave Bakura his.</p><p>They finished their meal mostly in silence though Ranko noticed Bakura looking at her several times. His eyes really did seem to hold so much love in them, it wasn't the way Genma had looked at her either before he hurt her. Bakura wasn't watching just a part of her body though she did notice his eyes sweep over her once or twice though the always ended up looking in her eyes.</p><p>When they finished Bakura paid the bill and left a large tip for Kagome then led them outside to where Ranko seen two of the most beautiful white horses ever drawing an open carriage where Bakura led her too.</p><p>"My lady." Bakura said, "Our ride awaits."</p><p>Ranko giggled as Bakura helped her up into the carriage then joined her. At first Ranko could tell Bakura was fidgeting before he put his arm around her which Ranko leaned into him, snuggling as she watched the stars for a few moments as the carriage started to move and enter the park.</p><p>"It's so beautiful." Ranko breathed, she often dreamed of something like this but she never believed that it would ever happen to her. She had all convinced herself that no one would ever want her after what Genma had done but here was Bakura who didn't even care that she was no longer innocent, he only wanted to be with her.</p><p>"Not as beautiful as you, Kitten." Bakura said squeezing Ranko a little, "You are the most beautiful thing on this world."</p><p>"Thank you, for everything." Ranko whispered as Bakura kissed the top of her head. All too soon though the ride was over as it stopped before her home. Bakura helped her down and they watched as the carriage moved off down the street.</p><p>Bakura walked Ranko up the path slowly while they both enjoyed each other's company as much as they can before having to part. Ranko turned to Bakura, nervous and really wasn't too sure what to say but tried, "Th-Thank you Bakura, tonight…it was wonderful."</p><p>"You're very welcome, Ranko." Bakura said.</p><p>Ranko wasn't sure who initiated it as Bakura moved closer and Ranko tilted her head a little bit moving close to Bakura until there lips met. Ranko closed her eyes letting the feelings wash through her as their lips pressed against each other.</p><p>Ranko didn't know why but she opened her eyes but instead of Bakura she saw Genma standing there with a hateful look in his eyes. She struggled against him and pushed him away as she feel to the ground crying. Genma was supposed to be gone, he was GONE!</p><p>"Please daddy…stop…STOP IT!" Ranko screamed, shaking in fear as she sobbed. He wasn't supposed to be here, why was he here?</p><p>Ranko finally settled down when she found herself on the ground with Nodoka holding her tightly.</p><p>"Hush baby, your safe." Nodoka whispered, "No one is going to hurt you."</p><p>"Pops was here, mom…he was going to…" Ranko cried.</p><p>"No, baby, he wasn't." Nodoka said, "You were having a flashback. "</p><p>"A flashback…" Ranko whispered remembering what the counselor and some of the others from group therapy. "Wh-Where's Bakura?"</p><p>"I sent him home baby," Nodoka said, "He was very worried about you but I told him to come by tomorrow and he said he would."</p><p>"I'm sorry, momma." Ranko whispered.</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>Nodoka had helped Ranko get ready for bed and sat on the edge of her bed while she was lying down and talked for awhile until Ranko finally fell asleep. Quietly she got up and walked out of the room, softly closing the door as she went.</p><p>While passing Nabiki's room she noticed that the door was cracked open and the light was on. Deciding to check and see if she was okay Nodoka stopped at hearing Nabiki's voice. Nodoka could see in the vanity mirror that Nabiki was lying in her bed while talking on a cell phone.</p><p>"Yeah, she had a flash back." Nabiki said which angered Nodoka, was Nabiki selling out Ranko again? "Yeah, I think she's okay Naomi. I'm just worried about her…I know what she's going through and I know how much it hurts and that's one of the reasons I want to make sure she has somebody there for her….Yeah, I do love her, she's so much like a little sister to me…Yeah, I was surprised to when she agreed to go out with him…At least I had you and the group but I meant I didn't have any family or friends who knew…The group only helped so much, even with my ice queen mask it was hard…Yeah, I have to go to, Ranko and me will see you for sure Saturday at the group…Bye."</p><p>"Nabiki?" Nodoka asked, pushing the door open and walking in, closing it behind her. She noticed that she scared the girl and smiled sadly. "Relax, Nabiki, its okay."</p><p>"You heard, didn't you?" Nabiki asked, fear in her voice.</p><p>"Nabiki," Nodoka said, sitting on the edge of the bed, "There's no need to be scared, I won't tell anyone if don't want me to but I'd like to be there for you if you let me."</p><p>"Why?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Because," Nodoka said, reaching out and brushed a stray hair out of Nabiki's eye, "I love you, all three of you very much. I don't want to replace your mother, but I'd like to become a second mother to you girls."</p><p>"I'm sorry." Nabiki cried.</p><p>"It's okay, sweetie." Nodoka said holding the girl until she stopped crying. When Nabiki started to pull away she asked "What happened to you, Nabiki?"</p><p>"You know how I made money for my family, right?" Nabiki sniffed.</p><p>"Yeah sweetie, but no more of that, right?" Nodoka said.</p><p>"No more of it but a few years ago I tried blackmailing some guy who lost a bet and refused to pay up. He finally agreed to pay me but I had to stop off at his home after school to pick up the money before he had to leave. I…I went but he had two other guys there and the attacked me and tore my clothes off. The each took there turn raping me and threatening me that if anyone ever found out that they would come back and kill me. They made me do things…I was so scared…I still am when I see any of them at school, I'm scared that they will do it again." Nabiki said, breaking down in sobs again as she finished telling Nodoka who hugged her again.</p><p>"It'll be okay, honey." Nodoka said, "I'm so sorry it happened though. You must have been very strong to hide this for so long and still continue supporting your family."</p><p>"I'm not strong…I only did what I had to, to make sure my family survived." Nabiki cried.</p><p>"So you go to some kind of group about it?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Yeah, that's where I took Ranko to the other night." Nabiki said, "I was talking to a friend from the group."</p><p>"If you tell me who those boys are I can…" Nodoka started.</p><p>"No." Nabiki said, "You promised not to tell anyone."</p><p>"Okay, just as long as you're getting help I won't and as long as you promise that you come to me if you need anything or need to talk." Nodoka said.</p><p>"I promise." Nabiki sniffed.</p><p>"Good." Nodoka said, kissing the top of Nabiki's head.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>AN: Thanks Den Scurman, I'm sorry I didn't have it last chapter but I'm giving back the date in this chapter. I should have had it in the last chapter but too much was happening to me, sorry everyone.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Isumo 1489:</b> Thanks and I love that idea with Happosai. And your welcome about the Belledandy thing, she is from another anime/manga I like called Oh My Goddess and they still might make a cameo or two in the future to check up on Bast. 1: I guess they are kind of stubborn but they make a cute couple. 2: I guess the others do seem kind of bland except for Bakura who I keep leaning more and more toward the more I write though nothing is set yet. 3: Thanks, I actually never thought of the twin card. 4: I kind of like this pairing myself a lot, a goddess and ancient mazoku who both love a little mischief. 5: I'm going to set a little ground work for them within the next few chapters, thanks for a good idea on how to do it. 6: Yep, Tomoyo will be with who has the second key who will likely be Eriol. I'm not sure if I have it but I have a lot of chants from several of the characters saved as well as about fifteen pages of slayers spells saved with what they do. Sorry, there are still two more captures to do before the firey card but one of them is two cards. Kero will be transformed though for about a week before the trials takes place on the full moon.</p><p><b>TheCentauress:</b> I kind of like darkstalkers a little so I did get part of Bast from Phelicia. As for MewMew Ranko, I was just kidding a little about that though it could make a great story. As for Ranko's cat ears that part is real though they aren't permanent. They appear when Ranko goes neko or when she gets really excited or nervous though that will probably stop as she learns to control it more.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> His shadow magic probably wouldn't help much but Nabiki does understand so she won't be to mad, she'll be more worried. Thanks, I wanted to show that Mousse does care for Ranko and I'm glad you liked Bast. I wonder what she'd do to a dog that would chase her, probably wouldn't be good whatever it was.</p><p><b>Den Scurman:</b> I wish I could more detail in my stories but I'm still working on getting better at it. Sorry about the date, I wanted to have it in there but it was going to be too long and I was having too many problems yesterday. I was thinking too much about my ex-stepfather on top of all of the interruptions. Even though my leg does feel better it's still hard to get around in but I manage. I hope you liked the date, thanks.</p><p><b>Ebona Nite:</b> Thanks, and that would be interesting. They might show up in Nerima for a couple of days for a tournament or something so the two groups can get together.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> The Slayers cast might show up in the sequel, at least some of them, but if they do I'd rather have the originals and not reincarnations. I'd want to see Lina and Ranko's reaction to each other.</p><p><b>Shurimon:</b> That's a good question and they Yugi gang may show up in the sequel to answer it.</p><p><b>Lov3the3vil:</b> It's very close to being Bakura x Ranko and I doubt that this will be the only date for them. Thank you, I will.</p><p><b>Gatodepatasblancas:</b> Thanks, Genma is far from one of my faves. They say write what you know so I try to though I want to write a good comedy Ranma fic. I checked it out and all the chapters seem to be ok now but I'm going to try and send an e-mail and let the staff know just in case, thanks.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> It will get better between Ranko and Bakura though it might take a little time. I know its gross, it's very gross even if it wasn't your real dad. As for the motorcycle, the guy driving it is a very good friend who I begged for a ride on it. Well, he wanted to show off and he lost control but wasn't hurt too but not badly. The worse injury was my leg and it did hurt, bad, but its feeling a lot better now though can get sore, itchy, very annoying at times. Thanks, I will.</p><p>Thank you everybody for your reviews and thank you to everyone who has read this and enjoyed it.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
