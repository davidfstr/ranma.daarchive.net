</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 20</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>SeCtIoN bReAk</p><p>If his Kitten wasn't inflicted with the neko-ken the Bakura would have stopped the motorcycle and told Bast to get away from him, Goddess or no Goddess. Yes she was ridding on the back of it and pointing where they needed to go, that wasn't bothering him. What was bothering him was the way Bast was purposely rubbing up against his back and purring in his ear while her hands kept roaming his chest. There way only one person he wanted doing that, his Kitten, not this perverted Goddess.</p><p>Of course Ryou was enjoying it though, much to his annoyance.</p><p>"Your girlfriend is just up ahead, cutie." Bast purred, pressing her chest further into Bakura's back.</p><p>"Would you please stop that!" Bakura Growled. Seeing Ranko he hurried ahead and spun the bike around in the street, unfortunately the insane catwoman Goddess was still hanging on, and skidded to a halt a few feet in front of his Kitten and another girl.</p><p>"Hi, Kitten." Bakura said with a smile.</p><p>"B-Bakura?" Ranko asked nervously.</p><p>"Is this your friend?" the other girl asked.</p><p>"I think so, Kasumi." Ranko said.</p><p>"Hey, she's a hot one." Bast said, "You sure can pick them cutie."</p><p>"Will you stop that, she's not my girlfriend." Bakura hissed quietly so only Bast could hear him.</p><p>"Oh cut it out and go for it before you lose her." Bast whispered back.</p><p>"So what are you up to, Kitten?" Bakura asked as Bast climbed off the motorcycle.</p><p>"Kasumi and I were heading home." Ranko said shyly, "We went out for ice cream."</p><p>"Well, Kitten, I have a surprise for you." Bakura said, "This is the Goddess Bast, she's going to help you with your kitty problem."</p><p>Bakura noticed that Kasumi was no longer by his Kitten now but where was she. A purring noise from somewhere behind him drawing his attention to where Kasumi was touching Bast's ears and the Goddess was purring loudly.</p><p>"They are real." Kasumi said in delight. "SO CUTE!"</p><p>"Feels good, honey." Bast purred.</p><p>"Then again, it's not too late for a good shrink to try and help you with it." Bakura mumbled.</p><p>"What did YOU SAY?" Bast growled, her eyes glowing red as a firey aura surrounded her.</p><p>"Scary…" Ranko mumbled.</p><p>"Nothing my Goddess." Bakura said then whistled innocently.</p><p>"Okay child." Bast said, appearing in front of Ranko with a smile, "I came to purge you of the darkness of the neko-ken and bless you with my true gift."</p><p>"Wh-What?" Ranko asked, startled at the sudden movement of the cat like Goddess.</p><p>"It's simple, Kitten." Bakura said, "Bast here is going to cure you of your fear of cats basically."</p><p>"Sure am, you see dear, the neko-ken is actually a combination of the vengeful cat spirits who died during the training possessing you and the corrupted powers of my messengers who was also killed." Bast said, "In order to remove the fear, we remove the cause by expelling the vengeful spirits and the corrupted power while at the same time bestowing my blessing upon you. However, if you do this, it will be irreversible."</p><p>"I won't be afraid of them anymore?" Ranko asked with hope.</p><p>"Sure won't." Bast said with a smile.</p><p>Bakura didn't like the smile though, he wad a very bad feeling about this now for some reason. Bast was just acting so different than she once did. The regal, serious Goddess he once knew was now replaced by a buxom, flamboyant, scatterbrained catgirl. This wasn't going to end well…</p><p>sEcTiOn BrEaK</p><p>Ranko was feeling very nervous now for some reason as she walked into the now dimly lit park with very few lights giving any light. Kasumi was walking right next to her, adding her unspoken support while Bast and Bakura followed closely behind.</p><p>Bakura was bothering her a little though the way he kept sneaking looks at her and though they weren't lecherous like Genma's was it was still clear that he was appreciating her body. There was more than that to his looks though, he also held some worry in his eyes but for what? Her? That thought made her feel good as they walked back into some trees that blocked the casual passerby's view of the group.</p><p>"This is good." Bast said. "Ranko, I want you to get comfortable over there. Just sit down and relax, try to empty your mind."</p><p>"Okay." Ranko said as she walked over to where Bast pointed and sat down on the ground getting as comfortable as here nervousness allowed.</p><p>"Bakura, I want all of my power to use in purging the neko-ken." Bast said, "Do you think you can maintain a shadow barrier to keep intruders out while I work?"</p><p>"Easily, my Goddess." Bakura said, "Just make sure nothing happens to my Kitten."</p><p>Ranko wasn't entirely sure what a shadow barrier was but was awed when Bakura's golden ring around his neck glowed brightly and shadows surged up from the ground creating a dome of shadows around them.</p><p>"Kasumi, no matter what happens you must NOT interfere with this." Bast warned, "If you enter the circle when I make it both you and Ranko could die."</p><p>"O-Okay." Kasumi replied, a worried look plastered across her face.</p><p>"Are you ready, Ranko?" Bast asked.</p><p>"Y-Yeah." Ranko said, a little scared.</p><p>"Relax Ranko, it may hurt a little but it will be ok, I promise." Bast said. Bast started chanting something weird but Ranko couldn't make heads or tales of what it was that was being said. A light surrounded Bast as she rose off of the ground about a foot. Lines of light then started to appear beneath Ranko forming a magic circle that reminded Ranko of the circle that appeared when using the cards except the prominent symbol looked like an eye in the center.</p><p>Ranko could feel warmth rushing through her body as she started floating off of the ground also before the pain started to take over then all she remembered was screaming before the darkness overtook her.</p><p>Slowly she opened her eyes again, laying on the ground as she heard arguing between Bakura and a very tired sounding Bast.</p><p>"YOU TURNED HER INTO A CAT GIRL!" Bakura screamed loudly, "HOW THE HELL IS THAT OKAY!"</p><p>"Geeze, cutie, calm down." Bast said, plugging her ears, "It's only when she access my gifts. When she's like this she will be much more than just a normal girl."</p><p>"None of your other chosen ever turned into cat girls!" Bakura growled.</p><p>"I know, it's something new I wanted to try out." Bast said, "Don't you think it looks cute?"</p><p>"AAARRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Bakura screamed.</p><p>"Excuse me…" Kasumi asked meekly, "But what of…him?"</p><p>"That…is a little harder to explain." Bast said, "You see, while I was working on changing his file I kind of felt an outside influence tampering with my spell. Father, kind of, did it…"</p><p>"Father?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"Kami-Sama." Bast replied.</p><p>"Oh, this is just great." Bakura grumbled, "First you turned Kitten into a…a CATGIRL and then you mess up the spell making lord knows what or who that is. Then you blame it on Kami-Sama! How the hell is a Japanese god related to an ancient Egyptian Goddess?"</p><p>A lightning bolt stuck the ground behind Bakura, barely missing him. Slowly he turned around and reads aloud, "Bast is my daughter, so sayeth Kami-Sama."</p><p>"Wh-What's going on?" Ranko asked, sitting up causing both Kasumi and Bakura to either side of her and help her sit up.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Kitten." Bakura said, "Bast…sort of turned you into a catgirl."</p><p>"Oh, come on cutie, it's only while she's accessing the neko-ken and its only cat ears and a tail." Bast said in an exasperated voice.</p><p>"Can I control it at least?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"Of course, and if you ask me they make you look so much cuter, not that you really needed it." Bast said, "I can see why Bakura likes you so much."</p><p>"Bast…" Bakura growled.</p><p>"He even wants to take you out on a very romantic date." Bast continued.</p><p>"BAST…" Bakura growled louder.</p><p>"Then he wants to give you a big good night kiss as he drops you off at home." Bast said, hugging itself, "I can see it now, the two of you make such a perfect couple."</p><p>"THAT DID IT!" Bakura growled as he started getting up.</p><p>"Am I that disgusting?" Ranko asked a little hurt, it sounded like Bakura was getting upset with the idea of being with her.</p><p>"N-No way, you aren't disgusting Kitten." Bakura said, "I would love to go out with you as soon as you're ready to, or wanted to. But I can wait until you are ready, I know what happened to you but I can guarantee that it won't ever happen again with that bastard locked away in the shadow realm."</p><p>"Wh-What?" Ranko asked, shocked.</p><p>"I sealed his soul into the shadow realm where he will pay for his crimes." Bakura said.</p><p>"You killed him?" Ranko gasped.</p><p>"No, Kitten, death was too kind of a punishment for his sins." Bakura said. "His soul is in the shadow realm where he will experience the type of horrors he has brought onto others…onto you, Kitten. I'll do my best to protect you from anything else if you let me."</p><p>Ranko was angry, why, she wasn't sure. Genma deserved to pay for everything he did but what right did Bakura have to decide? He had taken a decision that should have been hers from her even if he did it to…protect her…</p><p>"You did it to protect me?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"Of course Kitten." Bakura said. "I will do anything it takes to protect you."</p><p>"Thank you." Ranko said as she leaned into Bakura who wrapped his arms around her. She was still a little upset but she could feel Bakura telling the truth about protecting her and it made her remember her old dreams, about a knight saving her. Maybe Bakura was her knight…</p><p>"What the hell…" a groggy male voice asked.</p><p>Looking toward where the voice was coming from made Ranko almost faint, there laying on the ground in the old red and black ensemble that she was forced to wear when pretending to be Ranma.</p><p>"Let me introduce you." Bast said closing what looked like a cell phone, a mischievous smile on her lips. "Ranko, meet the spirit of the cursed hot spring of Jusenkyo, your new brother, Xellos. May the heavens have mercy for you all…"</p><p>"WILL YOU CUT THE OVERACTING?" Bakura growled causing Ranko to giggle.</p><p>"Ouch…" the boy moaned as he sat up. "Where are we, last thing I remember is that weird woman asking me to help Ranko…"</p><p>ScEnE bReAk</p><p>"Now I got you." Li said, "Twin Card, return to your power confined! TWIN!"</p><p>The pink haired, elvin looking child started to be pulled back toward Li's sword until if formed into a card but when Li reached out to take it, it suddenly turned back into the child and bounced off of Li's head knocking him to the ground as it ran down his back and down the alley.</p><p>"Li…are you okay?" Meilin asked, poking him with her foot.</p><p>"Don't do that." Li said as he sat up, rubbing his head.</p><p>"Fine…" Meilin said, waving him off, "They are the TWIN card, Li. They need to be sealed both at one time."</p><p>"Whatever…" Li grumbled.</p><p>"Come on, Li." Meilin said, "I'll help catch them. We will drive them toward each other and when the are both together, you can seal them."</p><p>"Thanks." Li said.</p><p>"No problem, cousin." Meilin said as she helped Li up. "Now let's go before we lose them."</p><p>"Right." Li said as he followed Meilin out of the alley and after the two elusive children that were actually a clow card, one that he intended to catch. As much as he cared for Ranko, he still planned on being included in the judgment and hopefully winning. Afterwards, he was hoping that he would be able to win her heart and return home with the perfect fiancé.</p><p>"There they are." Meilin said, pointing ahead. "You take the pink haired one while I double around and take the purple haired one."</p><p>"Right!" Li said as Meilin jumped to the roofs going over them. Li pulled out a scroll and pushed in front of his sword. "Force hear my plight, release the LIGHT! WIND!"</p><p>A blast of wind blew out from the scroll slamming into the pink haired child knocking it down while the purple haired one kept running until Meilin landed in front of it startling it into backing up and tripping over the other one.</p><p>"Twin Card, return to your power confined, TWIN!" Both children shrank as the flowed back in wisps forming a card that when Li reached out to grab stayed a card this time. "Thanks, Meilin."</p><p>"Your very welcome, cousin." Meilin said.</p><p>sCeNe BrEaK</p><p>"So, you were the spirit who drowned in the hot spring?" Ranko asked, sitting next to Bakura and Kasumi while Bast sat next to Xellos.</p><p>"Not exactly." Xellos said, "My body was destroyed and sealed in that pool a long time ago which is why the hot springs are actually much more stronger than the other Jusenkyo pools I imagine."</p><p>"How would you know?" Bakura asked.</p><p>"Because, not only do I remember everything that had happened since Ranko was cursed, I also feel the rest of my spirit that a couple others were cursed with returning to me along with what's left of it at the hot spring and I have all of those memories as well." Xellos explained, "All, and I can't believe I'm saying this to one of you, thanks to the Goddess there."</p><p>"Your welcome," Bast purred, "Maybe we could have some fun sometime."</p><p>The way Xellos looked at Bast after she said that sent shivers down her spine for some reason.</p><p>"I look forward to it." Xellos said.</p><p>"Good, because I also have news for you." Bast said, "As you regain more and more of your soul back your body will also change to reflect it, reforming into your original instead of your current template as well as your powers. Kami wants you to help your sister after she finishes her current tasks by training her in sorcery."</p><p>"So they all survived the great war with heaven?" Xellos asked.</p><p>"Yes, cutie, but they are sealed away in suspension though their powers are still available to be called upon." Bast said.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"Well…that's easy to explain." Xellos said with a grin, "You see…that is a secret."</p><p>Ranko wanted to strangle Xellos for that stunt as she heard Bast giggling. No, she wanted to strangle Xellos and a certain Goddess.</p><p>ScEnE bReAk</p><p>AN: Hi, it was close but scenario 3 actually won out though after thinking about what RubberNeck said about what happened with the Libra card, I figured that was an excellent point. So the soul from the spring is who gets the body and that soul is none other than Xellos. Since Ranko probably won't really look too much into improving in the martial arts I thought this would be an excellent way to increase Ranko's power in another way. Not only will she have the cards she will also begin to learn other types of spells as well for when Happi does come in the sequel, he will for sure now, she can just send him on a ride on a freeze arrow or something. As for why I decided not to call Xellos Ranma, or make a Ranma type persona with Ranko's memories was because I thought it may have been a little too painful in a way seeing a Ranma Saotome, the one her father tried to force her into becoming.</p><p>As for possible pairings:</p><p>Soun x Nodoka</p><p>Kasumi x Tofu</p><p>Nabiki x Tatewaki</p><p>Akane x Ryoga</p><p>Ranko x Ryoga</p><p>Ranko x Li</p><p>Ranko x Bakura</p><p>Sakura x Li</p><p>Shampoo x Mousse</p><p>Ryou x Ukyo</p><p>Ukyo x Ryoga</p><p>Bast x Xellos</p><p>Bast x Ryou</p><p>Meilin x Ryoga</p><p>Meilin x Ryou</p><p>Tomyo x (Character from sequel, sorry, this one is a sure thing)</p><p>I do have my own feelings on who will be with who but they do change, I originally wasn't even going to bring in Bakura and pair Ranko with Li but now its not a sure bet. Feel free to state your opinions on them if you want or vote.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Isumo 1489:</b> No big, and thank you, I wanted a punishment that was severe and permanent for Genma. I don't know much about Bakura's past except from what people have told me in reviews or e-mail so thank you. I really believe that to about Meilin, I prefer to have her friends from the start with Ranko than starting off enemies. I think she should make her own choice who to marry as well. As for the scenarios, sorry, I was trying to think of a way to bring in Happi because as it stood I didn't really want Happi coming in and destroying all the help that Ranko's been given so far. With Ranma, he would have been more powerful and could train a few of the others with Cologne to fight him better. The Belledandy thing was for granting Ranma a wish which would send him to take over the cursed body of Ranko's. Hope you and everyone likes how it went and you weren't being harsh, you had some very good questions. I should have explained better about the purpose of the scenarios when I did them.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> Thanks, and she will. I wanted to make Bast like this to cause a little mischief every now and then as well as make a more light hearted character. Thanks, I decided to just write section break so I don't have to worry about symbols. I wish I could have used symbols, I really loved my first section break.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> Thanks, at first I wasn't sure if I even wanted to make Ranko a cat girl so thanks again. As for Bast, well I wanted to make her different, more mischievous and as you said modern. It would be a good idea for her to play with Genma some, teasing him with how well Ranko is doing. She really does, though she doesn't try to act mean to Ranko anymore, some stuff like that will be unavoidable if Akane stays the was she is. Thanks but I hope you like the direction it ended up going in.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> You have a very good point and I'm not really sure if Ranko could really face a Ranma Saotome. Too many bad memories from both his visage and name. Hope you like how it turned out.</p><p><b>Borg rabbit:</b> Yep, Bast will help Ranko though she may cause some mischief here and there. As for a mental link, its possible but in the next chapter Bast's new form and home will be introduced. Poor, poor Kero…Thanks for the omake idea, I love the thought of a Baka Panda/Martial Artist card.</p><p><b>AshK:</b> I'd love to read your stories, in fact I plan to take a few days, maybe a week and do some reading when I finish this story while I work some more on the outline for the next part. The only thing harder than answering reviews though is figuring out what to put down as a review for stories. As for Ukyo, it's a very good possibility of her being adopted, thanks.</p><p><b>Jetforce4004:</b> Thanks for the tip, I'll try not to mix them up anymore.</p><p><b>Darkman v3:</b> I probably will bring in Happi but now he will be facing not only the Mistress of the cards but a sorceress as well.</p><p><b>Lov3the3vil:</b> Thanks though I'm sorry that isn't how it turned out. Hope you do like the way it went and at the moment Bakura and Ranko are getting closer though that could always change.</p><p><b>DenScurman:</b> Thanks, and sorry about the confusion with the scenarios. I should of explained what they were for a little better…well, maybe a lot better. The curse is separate now but it isn't a Ranma clone but the spirit from the spring. Thanks, I got a lot of good responses for my version of Bast. It does help explain a little where Akane comes up with all the stuff she does. And you're right, it would help throw people off with an altered appearance, thanks. I'll try my best not to disappoint anyone.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b> Akane does need to, even if part of her attitude came from the hentai horde as you pointed out, it truly is past time for her to move on from her childish behavior. And Ranko may crash again pretty soon though it will be in a different way that caused her to crash so far for the most part.</p><p><b>Shinigami:</b> Yep, Bakura is really a big softie deep down. Bast said she has a couple pics of where she sneaked a kiss from Ryou and since they share the same body, it would be easy to believe it was Bakura. Nabiki angered someone she shouldn't have by trying to blackmail someone but the whole story will come out soon.</p><p><b>Ebona Nite:</b> Thanks, and I do appreciate feedback of any kind, especially about this. As for Bakura and Meilin, its possible and so would Meilin and Ryou. As for Ranko and Li, they are a very good possibility and even though whats going on in this chapter, the future isn't completely set and anything is possible. Ranma probably wouldn't have but since scenario 3 won, though altered some, Ranma won't make an appearance, sorry.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> Thanks, I'm sorry about Kodachi though, that was one of the biggest reasons she was chasing Ranko's cursed side thanks to what happened with her garden. I'm glad you liked Genma's punishment, Ranko was able to finally face her worse fear and demons in beating him by herself. And they definitely won't do that.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> Thanks, I was trying to make it seem like that and I agree to some extent about video games though I also believe they have many good redeeming qualities as well and can be very helpful. You do have a very good point with Bakura and Cologne. Yep he did and his speech was kind of hard to do but I think it turned out ok, at least I hope. Sorry about the thanks bit but I really am thankful for everyone who reads or reads and reviews. I really am thankful for criticism and help with my writing though I don't like major flames where someone goes off just because of something that happens in the story that they didn't agree with so they try and make the writer feel small or hurt the writer's feelings. I know thank you or thanks doesn't sound like much but I really am thankful.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> Thanks, I was trying to make the chapter a little more lighthearted. As for Bakura, well he saw that Ranko was touched by Bast so that is where he got Kitten and he is forward and is dead set on making Ranko his girlfriend and more though he doesn't want to hurt her. Even if she chooses someone else Bakura would stick around for a bit and make sure that Ranko is okay and happy. As for Ranma, sorry he won't be making an appearance but there will be some chaos coming up and probably a lot of it in the sequel. You have a good point about Bakura/Ryou, besides for now its going to be better to not separate them. Thanks, I will keep writing and hopefully improve a lot. Thanks again though I already changed them again for this chapter which I'm sure will work since there is no symbols just letters.</p><p><b>Firehedgehog:</b> Thanks, I wanted to make a mischievous character to help bring a little chaos and maybe some fun into the story.</p><p>Thanks everyone for reading and reviewing. I'm also working on a webpage for my stories now so anyone who would like to make any fanart for this or any of my stories I'd appreciate it. Just e-mail them to me and I'll post them and send you an e-mail when I do. Thanks again.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
