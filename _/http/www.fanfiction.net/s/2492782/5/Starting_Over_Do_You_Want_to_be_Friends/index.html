</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 5</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>Ranko, still in her girl form, was walking home solemnly next to Nabiki and Akane. The looks Li was giving her near the end of the day, for some reason they hurt her. Every time he looked at her his eyes seemed to be filled with accusations and anger. She knew that it shouldn't really bother her but it did and what was worse she had no idea why it was affecting her so much.</p><p>"Are you okay, Ranma?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Yeah, thanks Akane," Ranko said, "Just a lot on my mind."</p><p>"Ranko…I want to help you." Nabiki said, "But you have to let me."</p><p>Ranko stopped in fear as she stared at Nabiki, trying to figure out what the older girl was saying. "H-How?"</p><p>"We should tell the authorities, send his but to jail." Nabiki said, "He should pay for everything that he has done to you."</p><p>"Don't you think I've tried that before?" Ranko asked, "I learned not to tell anyone and it was a mistake telling you two because now if her finds out…I don't want to see you hurt."</p><p>"He won't hurt us, Ranma." Akane said reassuringly.</p><p>"Do you two plan on breaking your promise not to tell?" Ranko asked, squeezing her eyes shut tightly.</p><p>"We won't tell anyone, promise." Akane said.</p><p>The started walking again heading for home, Ranko feeling a little better than a few minutes ago. For some reason, even though it scared her when Nabiki brought it up it also made her happy in a way, knowing that she actually cared and was trying to help.</p><p>They were just passing by Tofu's clinic when Ukyo caught up with them. The chief looked confused and somewhat angry when she stopped in front of them.</p><p>"What the hell is going on, Ranma honey?" Ukyo demanded, her hand itching to unsheathe her battle spatula. "Why was you telling that Li kid your name was Ranko! And on top of that why the hell were you FLIRTING with him?"</p><p>"Not now, Ukyo, we don't have time for this." Nabiki said trying to wave off the mad chief.</p><p>"Make time, sugar!" snapped Ukyo, "It's bad enough having to compete with Akane and Shampoo but I sure as hell refuse to compete with a boy for you! I'm your cute fiancé you jackass, so why the hell was you flirting with HIM?"</p><p>"Ukyo…two thousand yen…" Nabiki said holding out her hand.</p><p>Ranko gasped when Nabiki did that, she felt as if she were being betrayed all over again and for that cheap a price. She should have known better than to trust the mercenary girl with anything much less trust her.</p><p>"FINE!" Ukyo snapped, "But it better be good."</p><p>"It is, believe me it is." Nabiki said as she took the money and smiled, "You see Ukyo, Ranma met that Li kid awhile back in a challenge match but he showed up after being splashed with cold water. Since he didn't want to let some stranger know about the curse he told Li that his name was Ranko. As for flirting, are you serious, we are talking about Mister Macho here. He was just trying to figure out how to tell the Li kid the truth without being completely embarrassed."</p><p>"I-I guess that makes since…" Ukyo said skeptically, "I have to get home and open up, but I'm watching you Ranchan, you're mine."</p><p>Ranko had to move a little away from Akane as the other girls battle aura was getting kind of hot. "Nabiki, I'm really sorry, I thought you was going to tell her the truth."</p><p>"Of course not, Ranma, I promised you I wouldn't. It's okay though, I don't blame you." Nabiki said. "Trust is a very fragile thing and I haven't really given you any real reason to trust me."</p><p>"Still, I'm really sorry Rank…Ranma…" Nabiki said.</p><p>"I'm sorry to for everything that I've done to you since you came here." Akane said.</p><p>"Well that makes three of us who are sorry because I'm so sorry for acting like such a jerk when I got here. I…I don't know, I had to because…" Ranko said as she rubbed her eyes.</p><p>"It's okay, we understand Ranma and we're here for you." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Yep." Akane said, taking Ranko's hand, "Come on, let's get home."</p><p>"Okay." Ranko said as she walked with Nabiki and Akane, feeling a little strange holding hands with but for some reason it felt to good to let go.</p><p>It wasn't to long when they arrived home and the news was announced that Akane's aunt on her mother's side had just moved to Nerima. She had invited the Tendo's over for dinner and was sending a cab over to pick them up. The cab could only fit three passengers in the back and one up front which meant only Soun, Kasumi, Nabiki and Akane was able to go which didn't sit to right with Akane.</p><p>"Well, if Ranma can't go then I don't want to go either." Akane said.</p><p>"You have to go, sis." Kasumi said, "We haven't seen her in such a long time…not since mother died."</p><p>"Akane, go, please." Ranko whispered to her, "I'll be fine, Kasumi left some food in the fridge and Kero is out exploring anyways... I'm just going to relax tonight so please don't worry and just enjoy yourself."</p><p>"If you're sure, Ranma." Akane said.</p><p>"I'm sure." Ranko said. She fidgeted as Soun and Kasumi kept looking at Akane and her with sweet expressions and it was starting to make the red head nervous.</p><p>"Okay I guess." Akane said when the sound of a car horn honking startled the group.</p><p>"That's the cab, everyone." Soun said as he ushered everyone out, "See you later Saotome, don't stay out drinking by yourself too late since I won't be there to bail you out."</p><p>The tone was just jokingly but Ranko could see an angry look in her father's eyes, one that reminded her of the look he got before he would start his beatings.</p><p>"So, tell me, who is this Li brat?" Genma demanded as Ranko started to leave the room.</p><p>"What?" Ranko asked, nervous. "Who's Li?"</p><p>"Wrong answer, whore." Genma said as he rushed at Ranko hitting her hard enough to knock her to the floor. "Let's try again, shall we? What do you think you are doing flirting with some punk brat? What the hell did I do to deserve such a worthless whore for a child anyways?"</p><p>"I-I wasn't fl-flirting." Choked out Ranko.</p><p>"LIAR! I HEARD YOU AT TOFU'S" Genma screamed in rage as he kicked Ranko hard in the stomach. "I swear if you mess this up I will KILL you!"</p><p>Ranko cried out in pain as Genma kicked Ranko a few more times as she tried to curl up and hopefully protect herself a little bit from the hits. When he finished Ranko curled up sobbing from the pain, both emotional and physical. Her heart felt like it was being torn out and her whole body felt like it was on fire.</p><p>"I'll tell you what, I'm going to do you a favor." Genma said sadistically as he grabbed Ranko's hair, "You want it so much I'll give it to you."</p><p>It was late night when Kero finally returned home to the dojo and he was exhausted. He went out looking for anything that he could get for Ranko to make her feel better since she's been on such an emotional rollercoaster lately. He found a poster of Magic Knight Rayearth and bought it for her with a little bit of money he had.</p><p>He laughed to himself when he thought back to the expression on the face of that store clerk when they saw Kero. Then Kero had asked them if they never heard of a curse before as a small bit of a gamble and it paid off. The clerk started nodding in sympathy and offered Kero a glass of hot water.</p><p>Now he was sneaking up into the attic where he had a small bed hidden off in the corner hidden with a bunch of boxes. He had a small bed Ranko had made him, an old television that she had found and a playstation and a few games she bought for the two of them as well as a few worn manga's from a used book store that mainly Ranko read.</p><p>Stopping for a second after he was sure he heard a noise, Kero listened carefully. A sobbing noise was coming from the corner and it sounded exactly like Ranko. He carefully made his way to the corner and gasped at Ranko laying there huddled in a ball in the corner crying. He could tell from the girl's movements that she was hurting, like someone had…beaten her.</p><p>A small growl escaped Kero causing Ranko's head to shoot up, her face soaked with tears and a bruise forming on her cheek and another one around her neck where it looked like she was being choked by someone. "I'm s-sorry." Ranko cried softly, her voice hoarse.</p><p>""Shhh…don't be, Ranko." Kero said, "Where is everyone?"</p><p>"Visiting f-family." Ranko cried.</p><p>The poster he had bought for Ranko was forgotten for the moment as he came closer to the red head and noticed the condition of her clothes. Her shirt was only staying closed from her holding it like that, it looked like it was ripped open. And her pants looked okay except for the elastic in them looked like it was broken since they were so lose.</p><p>"That bastard did this, didn't he?" Kero asked.</p><p>"Y-yes…" Ranko sniffed.</p><p>"I'll kill him!" Kero growled.</p><p>"NO!" Ranko cried out.</p><p>"Ranko, he…you don't deserve this! It has to stop." Kero said.</p><p>"Please don't l-leave me." Ranko cried.</p><p>Sighing sadly he floated closer to Ranko who reached out and hugged him tightly, as if he was her only lifeline. Her whole body shook with each sob as she cried while Kero kept trying to soothe her a little.</p><p>"I will never leave you, Ranko, never again." Kero swore, fully intending it. He would never let this happen to her ever again. Kero froze for a second when he felt a card close by, really close by. He ignored it though after a second, right now Ranko needed him and she was more important.</p><p>AN: This chapter was pretty rough on Ranko but pretty soon Genma will be getting his due and paying for his crimes against Ranko. Also, soon everyone will learn the truth behind Ranma. So hopefully soon she will be out from under Genma and things will start to get better for her.</p><p>As for Li, Ranko was attracted to him and he is one of the few guys she ever had feelings for. I'm not to sure if they will be a pairing or not though, it was an idea I was thinking about but depending on his reaction to the curse could blow any chances of them being together clear out of the water.</p><p>And thanks to everyone who have read this story and enjoyed it and also thanks to all of my reviewers.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> I kind of forgot about the cat-fist, thanks. That's a very good idea though there aren't any fear or cat cards, there are a few cards that could probably do it. As for Genma, I have the next few chapters worked out for the most part and Genma will be paying a little for what he has done. I don't want to give away too much but Nabiki, the police, and a card are involved as well as someone else who I hope the changes I made to won't be to disturbing…She'll be the cause of some major changes though in the chapters to come.</p><p><b>Goku:</b> Ranko may have been abuse while she was growing up but she was still taught the art because if she wasn't any good in it there was a high probability Soun may have refused the arrangement in Genma's mind. So she can see auras and gauge an opponent easily and there skill level. She wasn't attracted to too many guys growing up but she did have one or two major crushes on fighters that were her equal or better. She usually saw them as her knight and shining armor in her daydreams or fantasies as she wished they'd take her away from Genma though her fear of Genma caused her to keep pretending to be a boy.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> I don't want to give out too much info on the next few chapters as I said but there will definitely be more people finding out about the secret of Ranko. Thank you very much, I'm glad you're enjoying the story and fining it interesting.</p><p><b>Masaki yang yi1: </b>Thanks, and there will be a little more insight into Genma and Ranko in the next few chapters but it won't be very pretty. However after that it should start getting better for Ranko though Genma will have to be dealt with several times.</p><p><b>Gatomon666:</b> I'm not really all that great, in fact I know I'm far from the best writer out there though I am trying very hard to improve. Ranma is one of the best anime's there is though. .</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk: </b>Well, if you hate Genma now…you will really hate him soon. And well…I think I might go ahead and ruin one surprise…Madison may become another character I bring in though if she is she'll probably work with Nabiki on the filming and costumes, and maybe even Kasumi. Can't really see Nabiki sewing much but a lot of video editing for sure. Also, there's no way I'm making Madison a fiancé, I want them to be friends from the start if she appears. I really wasn't going to bring in Madison before though but I think it would be a good idea so thank you for the suggestion.</p><p>Well, thank you all for reviewing so far and please keep it up.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p><p>P.S.
