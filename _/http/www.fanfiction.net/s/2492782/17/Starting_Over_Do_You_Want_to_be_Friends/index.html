</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 17</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>Ranko woke up feeling better than she had in a long time, slowly sitting up and looking down at the Libra Card in her hand. She didn't remember having the Libra Card out when she went to bed then she remembered her dream, well, parts of it. Was the Libra really in her dream the previous night? She was sure of it and it judged her, told her that she wasn't dirty and that she did deserve friends.</p><p>Thinking about it, she still felt bad but she also felt so much stronger for some reason. She didn't feel as scared as she usually did deep down, even though she usually tried to hide it until it became too much. She was sure that it was going to be a great day today and she smiled as she got out of the bed and found Kero playing video games on the new television with a small set of earbuds on so the sound wouldn't wake Ranko. Deciding not to disturb her small friend she gathered some clothes for the day and headed off to take a bathe.</p><p>Genma was scared and still a little sore from that little brats attack. Of course it wasn't going to stop him but he also wasn't going to be as stupid as he was before. He decided to just go ahead and skip town but first, he was going to take care of that little traitorous girl. He was a little scared of the dream though, it was way realistic for his tastes but that was all it was, right? Just a dream.</p><p>Mousse had woken up early and left to walk through the city so he could think of everything that has happened lately. He should be gloating and ecstatic over finally having Shampoo freed from Ranma but he never wanted it to happen at this cost. He heard everything and he could hear it in Ukyo's voice, it was the truth and Mousse believed it. The "I am a GUY!" bit that Ranma used to proclaim seemed to come to be insincere but Mousse had chalked it up to confusion after being cursed.</p><p>Mousse may have been half blind but his other senses had developed a great deal including his hearing. He could pretty much tell when a person was telling the truth by the tone and pitch of the person's voice. It was a hard skill to learn, even harder than the hidden weapons technique, but he had managed to learn it.</p><p>And at times it came in handy as it did now, he jumped back just as a girl sent a kick at him narrowly dodging it. The girl's face was hidden by a mask and she wore Chinese fighting robes though not like the ones the Amazons used. Glad for once that he had his glasses on he blocked attacks as he retaliated with his own. The girl was good, very good, but something seemed familiar about her.</p><p>"Is that all you got, Mousse?" the girl laughed as she picked up the pace forcing Mousse to do the same. Finally Mousse took advantage of an overextended punch from the girl by grabbing her arm and flipping her over.</p><p>"Yeouch!" the girl cried in surprise and a little pain as she hit the ground, "Did you have to be so rough?"</p><p>"Who are you?" Mousse demanded.</p><p>"Hmph…don't even recognize your own cousin." The girl said in mock hurt, "You wound me dear Mousse, to my very soul."</p><p>"MEILIN?" Mousse exclaimed in delight as he glomped her after getting up. "What in the world are you doing here?"</p><p>"Relax cousin," Meilin giggled, "I'm here for two reasons, to see my favorite cousin in the world and to check up on my unwanted fiancé."</p><p>"Still haven't gotten out of it yet?" Mousse asked.</p><p>"Not yet…" Meilin sighed, "But we will, after all he may be cute but he is still our cousin and…eww…I'm not marrying my cousin Li."</p><p>"You used to want to though." Mousse said.</p><p>"And I used to give a damn about family honor." Meilin said, "They're all a bunch of hypocrites like those stupid amazons."</p><p>"I resent that." Mousse said.</p><p>"I know you do and you need to get over it cuz…those laws are ancient and barbaric." Meilin said. "You have gotten much better tan last time though."</p><p>"Wait…Li is here?" Mousse asked, "Why?"</p><p>"He's searching for the Clow…the last I heard the cards were released." Meilin said. "Cologne and Shampoo don't know about it do they?"</p><p>"I gave you my word that I would tell no one of any family secrets outside the family." Mousse said, "Besides, I don't want to see the dried up prune getting her hands on something like that."</p><p>"So what are you doing out here?" Meilin asked, "Taking a morning stroll?"</p><p>"Not exactly…" Mousse said, "I was thinking about someone I thought was a rival for Shampoo until I learned that he was a she."</p><p>"Oooo…Little Moussey has a crush on another girl." Meilin giggled causing Mousse to blush, "So what's she like?"</p><p>"I don't have a crush on her, I was thinking about some…stuff that she's been through. Mousse said, "Some very bad stuff and somehow I have a feeling it's a lot worse than what I know."</p><p>"What kind of stuff?" Meilin asked, growing serious.</p><p>"Her father…he abused her…in more ways than one." Mousse said sadly, "If I ever get my hands on Genma Saotome I'll make a panda skin rug."</p><p>"Jusenkyo?" Meilin asked.</p><p>"Jusenkyo." Mousse agreed.</p><p>Kodachi still felt woozy as she was wheeled out of the hospital by a nurse while Nodoka walked beside her. Her head was so much clearer than it had been for a long time and it was because she was away from her precious garden for so long. Then again it was her precious garden that had caused her to become like she was.</p><p>She couldn't wait to feel better and go find her Ranma, maybe now that she was feeling better he may like her more. She remembered how insane she had acted and hated herself for it and was sure that was why Ranma wouldn't have anything to do with her.</p><p>"Remember what the doctor said, dear." The nurse said as they stopped by Auntie Nodoka's car. This one was always Kodachi's favorite car unlike the van. This was an American import that was called a Dodge Viper. She loved the sleek look of the beauty and the power behind it which always excited her.</p><p>"I will, thank you." Kodachi said as she got out of the annoying chair and climbed into the car as Nodoka went to the other side and got in. A smile spread across Kodachi's face as the engine roared to life and the car lurched forward.</p><p>"Kodachi dear, you will be staying at my home while they finish work on your home but there is several things you need to know." Nodoka said, "Such as the girl you call the red haired harridan."</p><p>"I'm sorry Auntie, I…I don't know why I did those kind of things. I guess it was my jealousy over Ranma and the drugs just made me…" Kodachi said.</p><p>"It's okay dear, but that girl is my daughter and you are not to attack her, okay?" Nodoka said, wishing she didn't have to go over the rest of it.</p><p>"R-Ranko?" Kodachi gasped, "I-I tried to kill…I'm so sorry, Auntie."</p><p>"It's okay dear, it wasn't you but please be good to her, she's been through a lot." Nodoka said sadly. "Besides her there are several more house guests staying as well and I would like it id you tried to be friends."</p><p>"Of course, Auntie." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Kodachi…there is something else…you know that magic is real, right?" Nodoka said.</p><p>Of course she knew it was real, she after all met enough magical creatures and such. Even creatures she wasn't sure was magical but more demonical in nature such as that Alucard guy and that Integra Hellsing woman that her Auntie knew from England.</p><p>"Of course I do, Auntie." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Well…Ranko has a curse, dear…it turns her into a guy with hot water." Nodoka aid.</p><p>"A guy…she turns…into…" Kodachi said beginning to connect the dots. "Please…Please don't tell me…she was pretending to be…Ranma…"</p><p>"Her father beat her Kodachi and forced her to do it, I'm so sorry." Nodoka said, "I heard some stories from Akane and Nabiki and I'm sorry, I know how much you liked Ranma."</p><p>"I'll…kill…HIM!" Kodachi growled, tears forming in her eyes, "I'll kill her father, feed him to Mr. Green Turtle."</p><p>"That would be a good idea but I'm afraid he may cause the poor thing indigestion." Nodoka said, "And before you ask, yes I've seen to Mr. Green Turtle. Sasuke has been feeding him. Luckily he stayed out of the main house and stayed in that little shack that your brother made him stay in. It wasn't connected to the air ducts so it was affected like the rest of the place was."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Kodachi sad, happy that her precious pet was okay but feeling a little depressed over losing Ranma…and for attacking her own cousin for something that wasn't even true, just a delusion brought on by her garden. Maybe botany was a bad hobby after all.</p><p>"Ta-Da!" Tomoyo said happily as she showed Ranko the outfit her and Nabiki had designed for the red head to wear that night while the three went searching for the last few cards that was out there. Ranko thought the outfit was kind of cute though the cat ears did make her a little nervous.</p><p>"What do you think?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Why are you planning on following me and taping this again?" Ranko sighed.</p><p>"For prosperity!" Both Tomoyo and Nabiki said at the same time then broke into giggles.</p><p>"Come on, Ranko, it'll be fun." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Fine, I'll wear it." Ranko said causing the other two girls to glomp her.</p><p>"First we have dinner preparations to make though." Ranko said, "Don't forget, mom said she was bringing Kodachi home and all of us are going out."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Tomoyo said.</p><p>"Ranko?" Kasumi said, knocking on the door.</p><p>"Come in." Ranko called as Kasumi came in with a large yellow envelope. "A courier just dropped this off and said it was for your mother and you."</p><p>"Really?" Ranko asked as she took the envelope and opened it. Inside was all of the forms to remove someone from a clan and forms for registering someone in the clan.</p><p>"Wh-What's going on?"</p><p>"Oh." Nabiki said, "Those are the papers your mom asked to have sent. She asked me to help fill them out to transfer you from the Saotome clan to the Kuno clan. It was…well, she wanted to talk to you before finalizing it."</p><p>"Really?" Ranko asked, surprised and grateful. In a way she could start over again, no more worries about the Saotome name and all of the trouble that it brought. No more having to worry about suitors showing up for her and the embarrassment of them actually being girls.</p><p>"Yep, your mother wants to bring you into her clan and already has her brother's approval." Nabiki said, "And I don't want you telling anyone this but she also has papers there to adopt Tatewaki and Kodachi if that idiot of a father pulls any more stupid stunts. She has the authority to throw him out of the clan and the school board will probably get rid of him soon after."</p><p>"Wow…" Ranko said, shocked. She not only would be able to start over again but she would have a brother and sister for real. Granted they were a little eccentric but from what her mother said about what happened, it was safe to say that they probably wouldn't be anything like they was. In fact, Tatewaki seemed so calm and nice the other day and there first session was going to be soon.</p><p>"That's great, Ranko." Kasumi said.</p><p>"Ranko, everyone, we're back." Nodoka called from downstairs. Kasumi, Tomoyo, Nabiki and Ranko walked downstairs to great Nodoka and Kodachi.</p><p>"Hi Ranko." Kodachi said as soon as the hit the bottom of the steps. "I'm…really sorry for the way I acted before and I hope that…maybe we could put it behind us and hopefully become…friends."</p><p>"Of course!" Ranko cried happily hugging Kodachi who after a few moments hugged back.</p><p>"Thank you, Ranko." Kodachi said.</p><p>"The paperwork came in, Nodoka but I'm sorry, Ranko got a hold of them and…" Nabiki said.</p><p>"It's okay." Nodoka interrupted, "So what do you say, Ranko?"</p><p>"I'd love that, mom." Ranko said with a smile as she pulled away from Kodachi. "Thanks."</p><p>"Your welcome dear, we will be Kuno now Ranko, they are our family and will help you if you let them." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Most everyone." Kodachi sighed, "My detestable father won't do anything for us so I wouldn't count on him for anything."</p><p>"He isn't a Kuno either, he took the name when he married into the family." Nodoka said, "And if you and your brother would accept me as a mother he won't even have that name anymore."</p><p>"You mean it, Auntie?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Sure dear, you know I always loved you and your brother like you were my own anyways." Nodoka said.</p><p>Nabiki couldn't believe the restaurant that they stopped at, the Uk-Chans. As they went inside Nabiki noticed that it wasn't busy, in fact no one was there except Ukyo and Konatsu who sat by the grill talking.</p><p>"Hi guys." Ukyo said, "Big party, huh?"</p><p>"Yes dear, and we was hoping it was okay to come here." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Sure, Konatsu will take your order and I'll cook everything up for you." Ukyo said.</p><p>Nabiki watched as most of the group moved to pull two tables together to make enough room for everyone as they sat down except for Ranko who went to sit at the bar across from Ukyo so Nabiki joined her.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ukyo…for everything." Ranko said.</p><p>"Don't, Ranko…please." Ukyo said, "I know it was your father's fault but it still hurts. I don't blame you as much as I would like to but…I don't know where to go now."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Nabiki asked, "Can't you return home?"</p><p>"I wish, sugar." Ukyo said sadly as Konatsu brought the orders so Ukyo began work on them. "My father said to kill Ranma or marry Ranma or don't bother coming back. There is no…Ranma."</p><p>"Ukyo…" Ranko said softly.</p><p>"I'll figure something out, sugar. Go join your family, I know what Nabiki and you like." Ukyo said. "We'll bring it over in a few minutes."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ukyo." Ranko said.</p><p>"Please sugar, just go." Ukyo said.</p><p>Ranko walked slowly in the costume that Nabiki and Tomoyo made her, she couldn't get Ukyo off of her mind. Kero was floating close by as Nabiki, Tomoyo and Sakura who was wearing roller blades followed. Tomoyo was filming everything and Nabiki had agreed to edit it, of course for 'prosperity.'</p><p>The outfit was black and pink with a choker and a small bell attached to it and had a tail and cat ears. It freaked her out a little and she wanted to strangle Nabiki for it but the girl had said she got caught up in Tomoyo's designs saying they were some of the best she had ever seen.</p><p>Ranko admitted it was kind of cute though in a creepy in of way, at least to her. She was still scared of cats all because of her father and that stupid technique. Even a 'meow' sent shivers down her spine.</p><p>"Ranko, I feel something close by…I think it's a clow card." Kero said.</p><p>"Wow, you look good." Li said as he walked up to the group then turned completely red, "I-I-I mean, hi…"</p><p>"Hi Li." Ranko said blushing as well.</p><p>"Whose your friends?" Li asked.</p><p>"These are my cousins Sakura and Tomoyo and one of my best friends, Nabiki." Ranko said waving to each, "And of course Kero."</p><p>"Keroberos?" Li asked, shocked.</p><p>"Yeah, what's it to you?" Kero asked.</p><p>"Heh…it really is him, short temper to match his short form." Li said laughing.</p><p>"Wait up, Li." A girl called who was hurrying to join them along with Mousse.</p><p>"Hi, Ranko, Nabiki." Mousse said.</p><p>"There it is!" Ranko cried as she dashed off after a little creature. She could tell that it was it by the magic it was radiating, Clow Reed's magic.</p><p>"Wait up." Li called from behind. The creature was fast though, it was hard to get a good look at but it almost looked like a fox.</p><p>Pulling out the key of clow Ranko called, "Key of Clow! Power of Magic, Power of Light, Surrender the wand The force ignite! RELEASE!" The key extended into her staff as she pulled out a card, "Jump Card, lend me your powers! JUMP!"</p><p>Little wings appeared on Ranko's shoes as she jumped high into the air following the creature. "It's the dash card!" Kero called from behind.</p><p>She was so close no, just a little farther ahead…As she landed and jumped again the creature turned hastily another direction as Ranko was in mid air. While she was great at mid air maneuvering this was a little past even her as she over shot the creature before landing.</p><p>Sighing she returned the jump card and put it back in her subspace pocket and returned the staff to the key. She wasn't going to give up though, she could still catch it. Turning toward the direction it took off in she started to take off after it before a hand shot out and grabbed her arm.</p><p>"I finally got you!" Genma growled, "You worthless little trash!"</p><p>"Let me go." Ranko cried out as she struggled and actually managed to break free.</p><p>"Leave her alone!" Ryoga demanded as he appeared out of the trees and punched Genma sending him flying back.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Mousse asked landing next to Ranko as Nabiki, Tomoyo and Sakura came running up behind.</p><p>"She belongs to me!" Genma growls.</p><p>"No she doesn't!" Ryoga growls back, cracking his knuckles.</p><p>"Don't Ryoga…" Ranko said nervously, "Please don't."</p><p>"Ranko, he deserves a beat down…heck, he deserves to die!" Ryoga said.</p><p>"As if you could hurt me you stupid punk, you can't even find your way out of a phone booth!" Genma snorted.</p><p>"I want to do this, Ryoga." Ranko said walking in front of Ryoga, "I-I need to do this."</p><p>"Ranko, no you don't." Nabiki said worried.</p><p>"If I don't face him, I'll always be scared." Ranko said, getting into a fighting stance.</p><p>"So the bitch has bite!" Genma laughed, "I'll be making you whimper soon enough though."</p><p>"You'll never touch me again!" Ranko said rushing toward Genma punching him only to have it blocked and a counter thrown hitting Ranko hard and knocking her back.</p><p>"Have…to…relax." Ranko gasped, "I…have…to fight…my fears…"</p><p>"Fear this!" Genma snarled as he launched forward again only to be hit time after time again by Ranko's chestnut fist, this time sending him back.</p><p>"I won't be scared of you anymore…" Ranko said as tears fell from her eyes, "I won't let you hurt me again!"</p><p>Both charged at each other again, Genma readying a vacuum blade as Ranko's anger at what her father did to her fueled her, flowed down into her hand as she flexed it, ki claws forming unconsciously which she used to swipe right through the vacuum blade and leaving four huge gashes across Genma's chest knocking him back onto the ground, blood soaking his dirty gi.</p><p>"Never again!" Ranko cried as she kicked Genma hard making him skip along the ground like a pebble.</p><p>Ranko stood as she watched her tormentors unconscious body skip along leaving spots of red from his blood. She hated hurting anyone but she also refused to take it anymore. She was always so scared of him but now that she finally found the strength to face him on her own, even though the power card said before that she did it, she never believed it until now. She had faced her worst demon and won, she had defeated the man who had made her life hell.</p><p>"Are you okay, Ranko?" Nabiki asked as Ranko fell to her knees, tears flowing freely.</p><p>"I will be." Ranko sniffed, "I finally did it…"</p><p>"You sure did, Ranko." Ryoga said, "I couldn't of done better myself."</p><p>"Come on, let's get you home." Kero said.</p><p>Li couldn't believe he had caught the dash card and only because it made a mistake by turning into an alleyway that was a dead end.</p><p>"It doesn't look like it would be that much trouble." Meilin said as she looked at the card in Li's hand.</p><p>"I know but we did it." Li said.</p><p>Ryu looked down in disgust at the stupid fool who was just waking up. It was still dark out, probably early morning but Ryu didn't care and neither did Bakura. They had found their prey and now was going to make sure he never hurt anyone else ever again.</p><p>"Who are you?" an old woman asked as she pogoed over next to him, balancing on the staff as she stopped before dropping to the ground.</p><p>"Go away old woman." Ryu said, "This doesn't concern you."</p><p>"It does concern me child, this fool panda has committed unspeakable sins." The woman said.</p><p>"And I'm here to see that he is punished for said sins…panda?" Ryu asked.</p><p>"Yes, the fool is cursed by Jusenkyo's magic to change into a panda with cold water and a man with hot." The woman said, "I am going to use an ancient technique that will take away all of his strength, leaving him as helpless as a newborn."</p><p>"Interesting…" Ryu said, "Do it then stand back because it will be my turn."</p><p>"What do you plan to do, child?" the woman asked.</p><p>"I'm not going to do anything…" Ryu said as the millennium ring faded into existence around his neck and glowed brightly.</p><p>"I am." Bakura said with an evil smirk, "We are going to play a shadow game."</p><p>"Interesting." The woman said with a smile, walking over and poking Genma several quick times with her staff.</p><p>"What do you think your doing?" Genma groaned as he climbed warily to his feet.</p><p>"She isn't going to do anything now." Bakura said, "I am."</p><p>Bakura laughed as Genma's eyes grew wide in fear, "Th-That's impossible…You're from my dream…"</p><p>"Dreams can often be reality and reality can often be dreams." Bakura said as shadows rose from the ground enveloping them in darkness, "Especially in the shadow realm!"</p><p>"What are you doing, child?" the woman asked, surprised.</p><p>"Playing a shadow game." Bakura said, "And you will be a witness to Genma's downfall."</p><p>"Genma Saotome…We are going to play a little game. Winner leaves here intact and the loser, they will spend an eternity in shadows." Bakura said, "As an added incentive I will even guarantee that you receive your hearts desire."</p><p>"What if I refuse?" Genma asked.</p><p>"You will surely die from your wounds." Bakura said, "Win and you shall live."</p><p>"I accept!" Genma said.</p><p>"As I knew you would," Bakura said, "Have you ever heard of duel monsters?"</p><p>"That's that stupid game that Tendo's brat liked for awhile." Genma said, "Tendo even made me learn to play the stupid thing. "</p><p>"Good." Bakura said as a duel disc appeared on both his and Genma's arm. "Think of what cards you want in your deck and they will appear in your duel disk."</p><p>"Duel disk?" Genma asked.</p><p>"Yes moron, your monsters go on it, magic and trap cards go in the slots and your graveyard is this slot." Bakura said pointing to each on his own in turn.</p><p>"Okay…" Genma growled out as cards appeared in the deck holder of the disc.</p><p>"Do you want to go first?" Bakura asked, sneering at the fool. "We have 8000 life points a piece."</p><p>"Of course." Genma said, pulling out several cards and looking through them. Satisfied he sat one down on the disc which glowed before a dark dragon appeared. "The Pitch-Dark Dragon."</p><p>"Not bad, fool." Bakura said, laying down Master Kyonshee, a chinese fighter with 1750 attack and 1000 defense points. More than a match for Genma's mere 900/600. Bakura attacked causing Genma to lose 850 points leaving him with 7150. Laying down a card in the magic slot Bakura ended his turn. He noticed the red hair that was now sticking out from Genma's bandana though with a smile.</p><p>"This is only a set back." Genma growled as he drew a card and laid down another one, the feral imp, a green looking monster that had wings and looked like a fuzzy, animalistic elf with a horn on its head and claws. Unfortunately, the idiot put it in attack instead of defense.</p><p>"You truly are an idiot, aren't you?" Bakura said, shaking his head. He put another card on his disk, the La Jinn Mystical Genie of the lamp that had 1800 attack and 1000 defense. Genma's Feral Imp only had 1300/1400. Bakura had his Master Kyonshee and Genie attack, destroying the feral imp and reducing Genma's life points to 3900. "I've had opponents who were little children that put up more of a fight than you."</p><p>"How dare you?" Genma growled then blinked in surprise. His voice was much more feminine. In fact, it sounded like Ranko's. "What the hell did you do to me?"</p><p>"Did I forget to mention that the loser's body changes into an exact copy of Ranko's?" Bakura laughed as he seen the look on the fool's face.</p><p>"We'll see who loses." Genma said as he drew and put another card down, this time in defense.</p><p>"I see you finally learned how to defend." Bakura laughed as he drew a card then put down Ghoul With an Appetite on his disk, a large, overweight bluish ghost with 1600 attack and 1200 defense. He attacked the card which turned out to be the Witty Phantom, a red demonic looking man in a dark suit with 1400 attack and 1300 defense and then attacked directly leaving Genma's life points at 350.</p><p>"This is not over yet!" Genma growls as he lunges at Bakura to attack but a hand shoots out and grabs his arm. Bakura watches as Genma finally looks down at his, now her body and finds out that he has completely changes into an exact copy of Ranko. Looking up at the person holding her arm she screams as something that looked like Genma dragged her off into the shadows.</p><p>"Those who cheat in a shadow game are punished severely." Bakura laughs as the shadows disappear leaving him and the old woman standing next to an unconscious panda.</p><p>"What happened?" the woman asked.</p><p>"For the rest of eternity Genma will live through the hell that he put Ranko through, the pain never ending." Bakura said, "As for that, it is only a panda now without Genma's mind. In fact, its curse should be looked that way since there is no Genma left in it."</p><p>"A fitting punishment though I'm not sure if it will ever make up for the suffering he has caused." The woman said.</p><p>"It may not but it will make certain he will never hurt anyone ever again." Bakura said.</p><p>"My name is Cologne, child." Cologne said, "Thank you for what you have done."</p><p>"It was my pleasure, and the name is Bakura, the thief king and my friend's name is Ryu. Bakura said.</p><p>"Interesting." Cologne said.</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, I hope you enjoyed this chapter. It did contain a clow card in it but I'm sorry to say it played a very minor role. Well, Li now has at least one card so he will be judged as well as Ranko. Now that Ranko is feeling better and even got to face her fear she will be stronger and the way for the last few cards is open for her.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Firehedgehog:</b> Thanks, hope you like this one to, its one of my longest ones I believe.</p><p><b>Borg rabbit:</b> You do have a point and though does look like it might be permanent, it may not be as Ranko grows stronger or an outside source may help her with it. What does everyone think about there becoming a Ranma separated from Ranko's curse?</p><p><b>Lov3the3vil:</b> Thank you and that is the problem I'm having myself.</p><p><b>Cyber AngelOne:</b> Thanks for your vote, and the sequel will much lighter.</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> I did to and I loved that episode. (Wishes they'd release a box set of both American and Japanese versions on DVD.) Sounds like your doing great on your game, congrats so far and good luck on the helicopter.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> Thanks, it did help her a lot. As for the Amazon laws, I'm not in favor of them much myself. And thanks, the prequel will mostly concentrate on catching the cards but also deal with what Ranko is going through prior this story.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> Thanks, it was a really great idea and Genma did face his punishment this chapter. I hope it turned out well. Your welcome, here's another and I hope you like it.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> It would have been good but Bakura did cause some nasty stuff to happen to Genma this chapter. Thanks for the idea, I really loved it and I'm glad you liked how it turned out.</p><p><b>Ebona Nite:</b> Thanks and here is the next chapter, hope you enjoy.</p><p><b>Claws1:</b> Everyone has there own opinions but they also must remember that this is fanfiction and as for this story it is alternate universe. I'm not going to get into a debate about Genma though, in this story he is the villain. I've read some stories where Ranma turned out to be the villain which I pretty much don't see that happening but it was still a good story.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> Thanks, I didn't really want Shampoo becoming an enemy and yes Mousse knows about Ranko and is happy though he doesn't like how it happened. Genma did meet his end in this chapter and I hope you and everyone else will like it. That's a good idea, while the main prequel will have to do with Ranko and the cards, I might write a couple side stories about Li and Bakura.</p><p><b>Brother Angelon:</b> Thanks, and Genma wasn't punished yet until this chapter. That is a good way to work on the prequel, thank you.</p><p><b>Den Scurman:</b> Thanks, I liked how it turned out and Genma finally did receive his punishment. Thanks again, that could be something that happens in the prequel with them coming after Cologne and Shampoo. As for Kodachi, I hope this was okay though she will react more probably when she finds out the whole story. Your welcome and you have a point, sometimes you do have to step on a few toes. Thanks very much, I just couldn't get the idea out of my head when I read the review. Thanks for the info on the Nyan Nyan, it sounds like it'd be pretty cool. As for geekland, I have a summer house to. I will definitely check out your stories very soon, thank you.</p><p><b>Shinigami:</b> I think I will have him show up but it won't be until the sequel. And many of the wrecking crew will become friends with Ranko and protect her as they will become like family to each other.</p><p><b>Firehedgehog:</b> Thanks, hope you did this one as well.</p><p><b>Isumo 1489:</b> Thanks, so far it seems like people mostly want a sequel. Thanks but the Libra wasn't really my idea it was Dragon Man 180's idea. And Shampoo, I'd rather her be an ally than an enemy and I do like Shampoo, Cologne and Mousse, I don't like the laws much. Thanks, I would like to hear your ideas on it since I wasn't sure to use Eriol or a new character. Thanks.</p><p><b>S:</b> Thanks and you have a point, she does need to be cured and I am working on it. She will have it more under control by then.</p><p><b>Claws1:</b> I think a Genma shrine would be a good idea for you to start, and they may but it all comes down to how each reader perceives it as everyone has there opinion. Thank you for the apology, to tell the truth I didn't know how to take it. At first I was hurt a little and upset and I didn't even really know how to even respond to it. As for two dimensional, I don't know. Things like this really do happen in real life.</p>
