</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 8</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>The ride to the house Nodoka was staying at was peaceful in Ranko's opinion. Of course she had to play twenty questions with Soun, answering about what happened and about really being a girl. To his credit, Soun didn't even cry about it. Of course he was upset, in a way he had a right to be seeing that Genma had lied and done all of those things. Soun swore that he never knew, he believed all of the lies Genma had given hook, line and sinker.</p><p>"I'm really sorry, Ranko." Soun said as everyone was walking up to the door of Nodoka's home, apparently one that belonged to her family and it was a pretty good size too. Nodoka even mentioned an indoor swimming pool which Ranko wanted to check out as soon as possible. She loved swimming even though she got very few chances away from gym at the school.</p><p>"It's okay Mister Tendo." Ranko said.</p><p>"Please…call me Soun, Ranko," Soun said, "Or even uncle."</p><p>Ranko smiled and replied:Thank you uncle."</p><p>"Your welcome dear." Soun said. Ranko noticed how different Soun was acting than usual and it all seemed for the better. He didn't seem over emotional like he usually did, he seemed so much stronger. Something in the man seemed to snap when he learned the truth and Kasumi seemed so much happier than usual. She even whispered that he was like he used to be before their mother died.</p><p>A small smile came to her lips when Nodoka opened the door and let everyone in, Ranko being last. She was able to catch both Nodoka and Soun checking each other out which gave Ranko mixed feelings.</p><p>"Welcome home, baby." Nodoka said, hugging Ranko.</p><p>"Thanks, momma." Ranko said, smiling. It was true, she was finally home, her home with her mother.</p><p>"Welcome home, Mistress Kuno." A young woman said as she came into the room, "And I see we have guest."</p><p>"Alita, please stop calling me that." Nodoka said, "And this is my daughter and her friends who will be staying with us while their home is fixed."</p><p>"Of course, Mis…Nodoka Ma'am." Alita said causing Nodoka to sigh from the formality still being used. "Welcome home, Mistress Ranko dear, I'm so glad that you're safe."</p><p>"Thank you, Ma'am." Ranko said.</p><p>"Please call me Alita, young Mistress." Alita said.</p><p>"Only if you call me Ranko." Ranko said with a smile.</p><p>"Of course, Ranko." Alita giggled, "You are so much like your mother, drop dead beautiful and a very nice personality. I bet you and my niece Madison would get along great, she'll be here next week after school is out for the summer with her friend Sakura to spend the summer."</p><p>"I can't wait to meet them." Ranko said hoping the two new girls will be her friends.</p><p>"Alita, will you show everyone to the guest rooms and give Ranko the bedroom next to mine?" Nodoka asked, "I'll be up in a few minutes. If you girls would like, I want to take Ranko shopping and you cab come to if you want."</p><p>"We're going shopping, momma?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"Yes dear so please get changed." Nodoka said, "I'll be up in a few minutes so we can talk before we leave."</p><p>"Okay mom, thanks." Ranko said, grateful for the chance to get to spend some time with her mom.</p><p>"I need to call in and see about taking a few weeks off and see about getting you girls off since there's not much time left anyways. Should be able to just take the finals and be done with it. I'll have somebody tutor you until the tests if you need." Nodoka said.</p><p>"That would be great Auntie." Nabiki said.</p><p>Ranko dropped her bag that she had a few things down on the bed carefully and put her pack on the floor. "It's safe, Kero."</p><p>Ranko watched as Kero crawled out of the pack and smiled up at Ranko, "I'm happy for you kiddo but I'm so sorry for…"</p><p>"Kero, let's forget the past and look to the future." Ranko said as she looked over the room. It had a large canopy bed with light pink drapes and darker pink sheets and violet blanket with moon and star designs on it. There was a large white dresser and vanity and large desk. On the closet door was a huge full length mirror that Ranko studied herself in. She wore her red Chinese silk shirt and black kung fu pants with slippers. She wanted to wear something more though, something that she'd look nice in for her mother.</p><p>She pulled her hair out of the pigtail and ran her fingers through it as it cascaded down and about her shoulders. "I think I'll wear that dress I used when I was messing with Ryoga that time."</p><p>"I remember hearing about that but I never really understood why you did that." Kero said as he lounged on the bed.</p><p>"Well…it's hard to explain Kero. I guess I didn't approve of him being with Akane unless he told her about P-chan." Ranko said, "I hate having to keep that a secret…but I promised…"</p><p>"Ranko…why even keep a promise like that anyways?" Kero asked.</p><p>"My dad…he took everything away from me Kero. All I had left was my honor…until he took that from m-me to…If I betrayed Ryoga's promise…I guess I'd be admitting I'm completely honorless…" Ranko said, wiping the tears from her eyes away.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ranko." Kero said as he floated over to Ranko and patted her shoulder.</p><p>"It's okay, Kero…I want to forget all of that." Ranko said as she undid her shirt and slid it off, stopping as it fell to the floor as she looked at the damage to her body, tears falling freely again. "I guess I can't forget about it yet…"</p><p>"Oh god, Ranko!" Nodoka cried out, startling both Kero and Ranko. Tears was streaming down the horrified woman's face.</p><p>"Don't look!" Ranko cried out as she crossed her arms over her chest to cover herself, looking down at the floor with her eyes shut tightly. She felt her mother pry her arms open a heard her gasp.</p><p>"I'll kill that bastard, I'll skin his ass, I'll…I'll…Oh god, Ranko, I'm so sorry." Nodoka cried, hugging her daughter tightly.</p><p>"Mom, it's okay, really…it's worse than it looks." Ranko said.</p><p>"Ummm…honey…did you know there's a flying stuffed toy in here?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Wise guy, ay? I have you know I'm the guardian beast of the seal and not a toy." Kero said then sweatdropped. "You wouldn't believe me if I said this was a dream would you?"</p><p>"Nope." Nodoka said.</p><p>"No one ever does." Kero sighs causing Ranko to burst into giggles.</p><p>"He's my friend mom, but please don't tell anyone." Ranko said as she pulled away. "Mom, Kasumi all ready looked me over and said I'm okay, It really does look worse than it is."</p><p>"The worse is the bruised ribs." Kero said, "If they was broke they would of all ready…Well, let's not go there."</p><p>"Please let's just go shopping, mom." Ranko said.</p><p>"Okay dear, but I did make a doctor appointment in a few days for you…just to be safe about everything else." Nodoka said. "And I do want a full explanation on him later."</p><p>"Thanks, mom." Ranko said, gesturing towards Kero. "Why are you taking this so lightly."</p><p>"Because I'm used to strange stuff." Nodoka said.</p><p>"I'm still here you know." Kero said.</p><p>"And one more thing dear, please be nice to Alita…it's a long story but she's your aunt but don't let her know I told you." Nodoka said, "She was kicked out of the clan awhile back…our father…he was spoiled and if you didn't do what he wanted he'd through you out of the clan. My brother is head of the clan but she refuses to come back into the clan or really talk to any of the others except me because I was the only one who defended her."</p><p>"Why is she a maid then, mom?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"It's complicated, dear." Nodoka sighed, "She has this hang up about working for her stay here but I still don't let her do everything. I really wish she'd stop this nonsense, it hurts when she calls me Mistress or any of that."</p><p>"Mom, how many brothers and sisters do you have?" Ranko asked.</p><p>"I have two brothers and three sisters though one of my sisters died years ago." Nodoka said sadly, "She married a stupid wannabe Hawaiian jackass."</p><p>"Principal Kuno?" Ranko asked and Nodoka nodded sadly.</p><p>"Come on, let's go shopping!" Nodoka cried happily.</p><p>Several hours later Nabiki couldn't believe what had happened. First off her family and she were living at what could be considered a mansion. Second, everyone was taking shopping except for Soun who was resting saying he needed some time to think. Currently they was just finishing at the tenth shop and loading the notebook computer, desktop computer, and all kinds of video and photography equipment that Nodoka had bought her. All of it was state of the art and VERY expensive. All of the stuff the woman bought for everyone was and there was tons of stuff. If they weren't in a large van she doubted everything would fit and still leave them room.</p><p>All four girls had gotten new wardrobes, stuff for there rooms like computers, cd players or whatever each girl wanted. Nabiki had no idea Ranko was so much into video games though since she had gotten three different game systems, a large television for them and like fifty games. And a small refrigerator to which had to be delivered with the television and some of the other stuff.</p><p>The biggest shock though came when Ranko wanted some DVDs, the whole series of Magic Knight Rayearth and the entire collection of manga and a few posters. That was one thing she never thought Ranko was into which made her realize one thing. No matter how much she claimed to care for the red head now and think of the girl as a sister, how much did Nabiki really know about Ranko? The answer kind of depressed her a little, only thing she knew of Ranko was the façade Genma forced the girl into. Nabiki should have known something was up long before she found out because Ranko, or Ranma, had always seemed so fake in so many ways.</p><p>"Ah, the mercenary Nabiki and my two loves, how are you this fine day?" Kuno said as he walked up to the group as Nodoka turned around to look on in curiosity. "And A-Auntie…how do you know the pig tailed…nay, the fire haired goddess who has finally let down her fiery hair…"</p><p>"Shove it Kuno!" Ranko and Akane growled.</p><p>"Tatewaki," Nodoka growled, "Have you been harassing my daughter and her friend?"</p><p>"N-No A-Auntie…" Kuno said as he paled greatly, "Where is my cousin so I may meet with her?"</p><p>"Tatewaki…" Nodoka said shaking her head in frustration, "Meet my daughter Ranko and her friend Akane Tendo. You may speak with them but do NOT harass them, or else."</p><p>"O-Of course…" Kuno said, shocked, "I am truly sorry for any affront I may have caused, I had no idea. But it makes sense that one of such beauty and fierceness is of the Kuno clan."</p><p>Nabiki shook her head, Kuno was an idiot through and through. But now she couldn't sale him pictures anymore which meant…she was probably going to have to sale all of her new stuff if she was allowed to keep it when they returned to there own home.</p><p>"Did you know of this when you sold me her pictures, Nabiki Tendo?" Kuno asked.</p><p>"Pictures?" Nodoka asked. Kuno pulled several large prints from inside his kendo uniform and held them to Nodoka. Nodoka's eyes grew large as she looked through them and turned to glare at Nabiki. "We WILL talk of this when we get back young lady and you better have a damn good explanation."</p><p>"Y-yes Auntie…" Nabiki squeaked, Nodoka was scary when mad.</p><p>Ryoga sighed in relief as he saw Ukyo outside her shop, probably after just getting home from school since she was still in her uniform. "Ukyo…you have to help me get to the Tendo's." Ryoga gasped.</p><p>"Why sugar, have a new technique to try on Ranchan?" Ukyo asked dryly.</p><p>"I wish that was all," Ryoga said, "Ranma's in trouble…we have to get there fast."</p><p>"Ranma?" Ukyo asked, "Come on, Konatsu can handle the shop while we're gone."</p><p>When they finally got to the dojo it was deserted except for a few people working on a large whole in the side of the house.</p><p>"Can we help you?" one of the workmen asked.</p><p>"What happened here?" Ryoga asked, "Where is everyone?"</p><p>"Some dumbass was arrested and everyone here is staying at Mistress Kuno's for the time being." The man said, "Are you their friends?"</p><p>"Yeah." Ryoga said and the man handed him a piece of paper. It read:</p><p>Hi, Sayuri and Yuka,</p><p>Auntie Nodoka said it'd be okay to leave the address for you two so you can come see me,</p><p>Love,</p><p>Akane.</p><p>Ryoga flipped the paper over and it showed the address but he was pretty sure it wasn't the Kuno mansion so who was they staying with.</p><p>"Sugar?" Ukyo asked as the two was leaving the Tendo's, "I want to know what happened, why do you think Ranchan is in trouble? Is it another idiot rival?"</p><p>"I tried to stop him, Ukyo…" Ryoga said sadly, "I was in my pig form and he tied my feet with my own bandanna. I tried to help Ranma…but I couldn't stop Genma from raping Ranma's girl side."</p><p>"This isn't funny!" Ukyo growled as she pulled her battle spatula into her hands.</p><p>"I'm not kidding, Ukyo…the bastard raped him…her…whatever…" Ryoga said, "I'll kill that stupid panda if I ever get my hands on him!"</p><p>"Oh crap…" Ukyo whispered.</p><p>Everyone was unloading everything and taking it inside when Nodoka's cell rang causing her to have to stop helping and answer it.</p><p>"Hello." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Nodoka, we have big problems." Kyo said, "Genma…he just vanished into thin air when we was taking him into the station. We've been searching for him all day but we can't find him."</p><p>"WHAT!" Nodoka screamed into her phone.</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, another chapter out and it seems for the most part things are starting to go better for Ranko. She has a big family now and will end up meeting some of it. Can she help Alita get over her pride and come back into the clan. Tomoyo is Alita's niece through marriage that didn't work out to well but she still cares for Tomoya.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> I always thought that since both Nodoka loved the sword so much and Kuno did that they had some in common. That's how I got the idea for it and I made it so Nodoka is the one who showed him kendo since he was so interested in the family art so he respects and fears her greatly. So as for him getting off Ranko's back it will probably help a great deal, and might even make him go from being overzealous suitor to overprotective big brother type. Thanks about the tip for the names, I think I will use the Japanese names for Tomoya so thanks again.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> Nodoka will probably most likely be upset over their reactions but I think it will mostly turn out okay in the end. As for Kuno wanting to get in to the Kuno bashing, it's most likely. As for the Libra card…(sweatdrops)…sorry, I know there is a Libra card but I kind of have no idea what it does. There's a few cards that I'm unsure about. I have the clow book and all the cards but I don't have any idea what some of them does so if you or anyone know a website that has descriptions on them or can help with what the do please let me know. Thanks.</p><p><b>Goku905041:</b> To quote the great Zorak, "It isn't easy being evil…but evil is what I be." Well, anyways it will help get the Kuno's off Ranko's back and I don't think it's much of a stretch to imagine them being related seeing how the sword is important in both families backgrounds.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b> Thanks, since Nabiki hated early mornings I figured this would be a good way for Kasumi to get the truth out of her. And as for Soun, he's going to be much better from now on. I agree with you, I always believed that Soun was pretty much a good person at core, just someone who had made some mistakes after never recovering from the break down after his wife died and Genma's manipulations. I think it's about time Soun moves on though, but it won't be a Soun/Hinako pairing, I already have plans on who to set him up with. Li will probably become an ally and Ranko will have some help catching the cards. I'm not to sure how the amazons will react though when they learn the truth, that's probably going to be a little complicated.</p><p><b>Reaper2040: </b>Genma will definitely be taken down some by Kero and/or Yue. As for the shadows, if I go with my new idea of bringing in a new character from a different series. Genma's final punishment will have something to do with shadows but it won't be from the shadow card and he'll be tortured plenty enough if it happens.</p><p><b>TheCentauress:</b> They will both be mad at Genma over the curse and will most definitely want revenge for that and everything else. As for Kuno's attraction Nodoka is putting her foot down but an asylum or doctor would be a good idea.</p><p><b>Death dealer:</b> Kill who? If it's Genma, he'll pay for what he's done and it'll be a lot worse than death.</p><p><b>Jonakhensu:</b> Anti matter sheep…mmmm…that would definitely be good for Genma. As for how the Kuno's reactions will be, they're vary some but not sure how it will end up completely yet, though I have a decent idea.</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> Kodachi will probably be the one who takes it the hardest, not sure how hard Kuno is going to take it yet though but he respects and fears Nodoka so I don't think he'll push it much while she's around. My spell check is evil though, it never seems to catch a lot of stuff and stuff it does catch is spelled right, it's just Japanese names.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> I don't know about the Li/Shampoo thing but I do know that someone else will be related to one of the amazons but it won't be shampoo. As for the teacher, yep, she's the one from cardcaptors. Her real reason for coming is to find the new cardcaptor but seeing her family is a big bonus for her. Thank you so much.</p><p><b>Lov3the3vil:</b> I know that Li will definitely be in the running now, I've decided that. But first there will be some tension after he yells at her for lying to him pretending to be a girl and calling her unhonorable.</p><p>Thank you everyone for al your kind words and reviews, they really mean a lot to me.</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne.</p>
