</div><p style="text-align:center;">Starting Over: Do You Want to be Friends?</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 16</p><p style="text-align:center;">Written by Senshi of Valis</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma ½ created by Rumiko Takahashi</p><p style="text-align:center;">Card Captor Sakura created by Clamp</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own any of these series or the character in each.</p><p>Ranko was confused, very confused as she stood next to her mother at a table that was before someone she was sure she should recognize in a judge's outfit. On the bench next to the woman was some kind of scale that also looked very familiar. Next to her table was another table where Genma stood with…Ranma…</p><p>"This court is now in session!" the Judge said banging her gavel on the bench. "There are several charges that one Genma Saotome brings against his daughter Ranko Saotome. Instead of reading off each item at once and we will treat each one as a separate case due to the severity of each charge. The first charge is of Ranko being a worthless piece of trash. Genma, why do you claim that your daughter is such?"</p><p>Ranko wanted to run away from what was going on, she was on trial! She couldn't move though, her body wouldn't respond to anything. She saw Genma sneering at her along with Ranma.</p><p>"This little piece of trash just had to do one thing, be the son that she should have been." Genma said, "I gave her the chance to be my son and she threw it away. I gave her love and she rejected it repeatedly and forced me to beat her. It is her own fault that I was forced to hit her. All she had to do was listen to me and do what I said, how hard is that?"</p><p>"How hard, indeed?" the judge said in disgust. "What is your response to this?"</p><p>"Your honor," Nodoka said, "I will speak on my daughter's behalf. Genma would never have been happy even if Ranko was born a boy, all he cares about is his stomach and his greed. He has engaged my daughter to so many families on the pretense that she was a boy just so he could steal their dowries. The fool messed up though when it came to the Tendos, the dowry was to be the dojo but would only change hands on the day of the wedding which gave them time enough to learn the truth. Genma is the worthless trash here, your Honor, not my daughter."</p><p>"That is not for you to decide here, Nodoka." The Judge said. "That is for the Libra to decide."</p><p>Ranko watched nervously as the judge held the scale towards the two tables as the side toward Genma sank and the side toward Ranko rose. "The Libra has decided, Ranko is found innocent of this charge and Genma Saotome is found guilty of being the biggest piece of worthless trash on the face of this earth. The next charge brought against Ranko Saotome is that of being dishonorable. Genma, would you like to tell the court just why it is you believe Ranko to be dishonorable?"</p><p>"Of course your honor," Genma said angrily, "The little brat doesn't have any honor, if she did she would of married Akane instead of wasting so much time. If she had any honor she would never of told anyone any of those lies about me. If she had any honor, she would never have seduced me. If she had any honor she would never have spread lies that I forced her into anything. She wanted it, all of it and I only gave her what she wanted. I am not to blame for any of it."</p><p>"Is that all?" the Judge asked, anger growing on her face and at Genma's nod she turned to Nodoka. "Please state your defense."</p><p>"This is the biggest load of bull that I have ever heard. My daughter is a girl, not a boy, so how on earth could she of married Akane. But that point is moot since by already engaging my daughter to so many people Genma had already broken the promise with the Tendo's and destroyed his honor. As for lies, my daughter told no lies of him, he raped and beat her. He ruined his honor even more just by doing that. A parent is there to protect and love their children, not hurt them as Genma did repeatedly." Nodoka said, "As for my daughter's honor, it is intact. My daughter has tried her best to always do what is right and do what she believed was honorable even if it ended up hurting her. Yes my daughter has honor, she is one of the most honorable people I have ever meet. Genma though…he has no honor, he is a monster, worse than a monster and has no right to live."</p><p>"I don't really see a point in using Libra since it is clear who is guilty here but for the sake of the court…and for the sake of Ranko…" the Judge said, holding up the scales once again, they reacted the same again. "Genma Saotome, you are once again found guilty and you sicken me more and more for the crimes you have committed but this is not over yet. How about the charge that Ranko doesn't deserve anyone?"</p><p>"She doesn't, she's a filthy whore. Who wants one of those around them, its disgusting even thinking about it. Just hanging around someone as dirty as her would just taint them." Genma said.</p><p>"That bull, your honor!" Nodoka growled out. Ranko was scared as everyone looked at Nodoka and herself.</p><p>Yes she was found not guilty so far but Ranko knew there was no way she would be found innocent of this then she would have proof of what she knew she was.</p><p>"Please continue, Nodoka." The Judge said.</p><p>"That bastard raped my daughter, she couldn't stop him. How does that make her a whore? She had no control while he forced himself on my daughter. She isn't dirty, she deserves so many friends, she is a kind, good hearted girl who never asked for any of this to happen. If-If anyone besides Genma is to blame…its me. I failed my daughter when I couldn't stop him from kidnapping her. I never gave up looking for her but I should of looked harder…I should of done something." Nodoka cried.</p><p>"Libra finds both Ranko innocent and deserving of friends and love and Nodoka innocent, she did all she could to find her daughter." The Judge said after using Libra again. "However, Genma Saotome is once again found guilty and deserves no one. I don't even see a need to go over this last charge but to set everyone's minds at ease, why do you think your daughter deserves to die Genma Saotome?"</p><p>"Because she destroyed everything I worked for!" Genma growled, "So many years and she ruined all of my plans. Now I'm wanted by the police for lies."</p><p>"She has been found innocent of and lies, Genma." The Judge said. "What do you have to say, Nodoka?"</p><p>"He is the one who deserves to die after everything that he did to my daughter, he took away so much of her happiness and destroyed her childhood." Nodoka cried.</p><p>"Libra agrees with you Nodoka," the Judge said, "Ranko Saotome, you have been found innocent of all charges brought against you. You are a wonderful young woman who has many friends who care for you and a loving family and a loving mother. You are not responsible for anything Genma Saotome has done to you, you are not dishonorable nor are you a whore or dirty. You deserve to live and be happy, Ranko Saotome and as much as I'd like to use the Erase Card to erase all of your pain I can not. As Kero explained to you to use it for that would wipe out much of your memory. I have faith in you that you will conquer this as you have overcome so many other obstacles. Don't let self doubt get in the way of what is rightfully yours."</p><p>"Can I have him now?" a new, familiar voice asked.</p><p>"Genma Saotome, you are found guilty of everything that you tried to pin on your daughter and so much more. You are here by sentenced to whatever punishments await you at the hands of Ranko's protectors." The Judge said, "Yes, Bakura, he's all yours."</p><p>A thick cloud of darkness enveloped Genma as he screamed in fear and pain as he disappeared along with the darkness.</p><p>"Ranma…you are part of the spirit from the spring and yet you are standing with Genma, do you believe he was in the right." The Judge asked.</p><p>"No, your honor, I do not." Ranma said, "If I could of I would have stopped him myself."</p><p>"For now, I can do nothing for you but someday in the future you and all who have been trapped at the springs may be released finally. Until then I ask you one thing, watch out for Ranko and please help strengthen her spirit and repair the damage caused by Genma?" the Judge asked.</p><p>"I would be honored to." Ranma said.</p><p>"Then this court is dismissed." The Judge said striking her gavel.</p><p>Nodoka shot up in bed, burying her face in her hands. That dream was so real and she could feel her daughter's pain so clearly and it hurt her so much. She knew Ranko was hurting but she didn't know it was that bad.</p><p>Each time the Judge found Ranko not guilty on each count though Nodoka felt just a little bit of the hurt, the anger, the self loathing and the depression each lift a little. Whatever that dream was, Nodoka was sure it was no dream.</p><p>She climbed out of bed and threw her robe on and hurried next door to her daughter's room. Ranko was on her back asleep in her blue pajamas with little strange animal print on them. Nodoka had thought they suited a younger child at first when Ranko picked them out but she never said anything about it. She wanted her daughter to be happy then and still wanted her daughter to be so happy.</p><p>There was a smile on Ranko's face as she slept which made Nodoka smile. As Nodoka pulled the blanket up over Ranko she noticed a card in Ranko's hand with a picture of the scale the judge used on it. It reeked of magic as did Kero who she heard snoring in the bottom dresser door which stayed open most of the time which now answered the question why it did and why there was some small sheets and a small pillow in it and nothing else.</p><p>"Good night baby." Nodoka said kissing Ranko's forehead and leaving to go back to her room.</p><p>Bakura shot up in the bed at the hotel he stayed at that night. The dream was real, he knew that much and he still felt all of the pain that seemed to radiate of Ranko. He growled as he climbed from his bed and quickly dressed and grabbed the keys to his bike. He knew what the bastard looked like now and he was going to find him. After all, even the judge had given the bastard to him to punish.</p><p>"Shampoo, what are you doing out here this late at night?" Cologne asked tiredly as she pogoed out the back door and into the small yard that they had behind the restaurant that was enclosed by a wall. Shampoo was doing katas which had woke up Cologne and annoyed her a little.</p><p>"Shampoo is sorry, Grandmother." Shampoo said, "Shampoo is confused…"</p><p>"What about child…" Cologne asked though she was sure she already knew the answer.</p><p>"Shampoo's Airen…if is girl and was tainted…Shampoo can not regain honor." Shampoo said.</p><p>"Tell me child, do you honestly want to kill your Airen if it turned out he was a she?" Cologne asked.</p><p>"Shampoo…Shampoo no longer sure." Shampoo said.</p><p>"You know if you did the laws say you would be tainted as well." Cologne said.</p><p>"Stupid laws…" Shampoo mumbled.</p><p>"I agree, child, many of the laws are stupid in many ways." Cologne said.</p><p>"Laws no better than what happened to Air…Ranko…" Shampoo said.</p><p>"What do you mean child?" Cologne asked, confused a little by this statement.</p><p>"If Amazon warrior beat by outsider…if Amazon no want to be with that man…law still says she has to. It's no better than rape…" Shampoo said. "Shampoo tired of too too stupid laws like that."</p><p>"Shampoo…" Cologne said sadly, "Shampoo, I have an offer to make you, one that I've been thinking about for awhile since we came here."</p><p>"What is it?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"I'm tired too of endless squabbles between the other elders, many of them over such trivial matters. I was planning on retiring from the council before we came here and leaving the village anyways to see more of the outside world before I die. If you want, we can stay here, I kind of enjoy all of the excitement around here."</p><p>"You mean it great grand mother?" Shampoo asked happily, "I'm free from everything?"</p><p>"Yes child." Cologne said, "You have your honor and are free from both kisses. And as for your 'Airen' I advise becoming friends with her if we are to stay. She isn't tainted or anything. What that fool panda did is horrible but it wasn't Ranko's fault child. If you want to take out your aggressions on anyone, do it on the panda. Kill him for all I care, just make sure no one catches you doing it."</p><p>"Thank you!" Shampoo cried glomping Cologne who was having a hard time breathing from the pressure. She now knew what Ranko must have felt like every time Shampoo did this.</p><p>AN: Hi everyone, after this Ranko should start feeling a little better and with Nabiki and Naomi's help as well as her family and friends, I'm pretty sure she will be okay. As for the rest of the cards, one will be in the next chapter as will someone new, the last new character for this part of the story except for Yue and of course the last few cards. I actually had something completely different planned for this chapter but after seeing the review from Dragon Man 180, I couldn't get the idea out f my head and I thought this would be the perfect place for this chapter as well.</p><p>Also, here's a chance to help me decide which to write next, the sequel or prequel. The sequel will be much lighter than this story and will most likely include changing the cards to become Ranko's. The prequel will be darker than this one most likely and it will be how she came to get the clow book and how she caught the other cards and how she deals with everything as Ryoga, Ukyo and the Amazons show up.</p><p>Review Responses:</p><p><b>Cptdave:</b> Thanks, hope this chapter is good to. Bakura will get a chance with Genma for sure and as for who is going to be with Ranko, I still haven't decided yet but it will be Ryoga, Li or Bakura.</p><p><b>RubberNeck:</b> Well, at first I was going to have Shampoo attack Ranko but I changed my mind, I'd rather have them friends than enemies. As for Genma, probably not and thanks.</p><p><b>Rubel:</b> Yep, very bad…though cheat or not he'll be punished for what he did to Ranko. As for Shampoo, you are completely correct, thanks.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk:</b> Thanks and no big, I didn't now about the thief king thing at first and it's a little easier since I started using Bakura/Ryu already. I probably will go into depth of it in the sequel though. And thanks again, I wasn't too sure how people was going to react to a Cologne who didn't agree with the village laws all that well. And you are right, support groups do help and I agree with you completely on it. As for Shampoo interrupting a capture, that's a great idea, thanks.</p><p><b>Mgsaintz:</b> Thanks, while originally Naomi was going to be the only one I decided to add Ranko to, especially to convince Ranko to go because she probably wouldn't have trusted Naomi at first and wouldn't have stayed without someone she knew there for support. I'll see if I can find that one when I get a little more free time. I haven't really had much time for reading once I started this story because I got to the point of trying to make a chapter a day because of a promise I made someone, thanks.</p><p><b>Dragon Man 180:</b> Thank you so much for the idea, I hoped you liked this chapter. And I don't think Shampoo will end up attacking Ranko now though I did originally think about it.</p><p><b>Smith:</b> Thanks but I'm sorry about you getting depressed and what happened with your grandfather and what you had to go through after. I always did like Ryu/Bakura, what I saw of them anyways. She is going through a lot but with this chapter she will feel much better, the support group added with the dream and her friends and family being very big contributions to that. Thanks, I try but it hurts from time to time and it makes it hard to concentrate then. As for Happi and Herb, I'm not too sure if either one will make an appearance but if they do it won't be until the sequel.</p><p><b>Badgerwolf:</b> Thanks, I don't really see Shampoo as brainless like I'm sure some people do. I just see her as having trouble adapting to a different language and culture than the one she grew up knowing so it was pretty easy coming up with her acting this way, though she is very unpredictable and puts too much stock in honor at times.</p><p><b>Isumo 1489:</b> Thanks, and it's a very good saying that I agree with totally. That's a good idea on how to help with the cats and everything. It could be a very good way to go. And you were a big help, thank you.</p><p><b>Den Scurman:</b> Thanks, and you do have I point. I know its hard remembering some past experiences, especially traumatizing ones, so I apologize to anyone that I did cause some pain from old memories. And you weren't ranting, you did make some good points. This type of thing is hard to get over and even harder to forget and there is no quick fix to it, it just doesn't work that way. Even not knowing the full story, Bakura and Shampoo will have a lot to think about and next chapter will be Kodachi's reaction and one of the clow cards may be caught but will be there. And this is harder than anything Ranko has ever faced, abuse and rape are two very difficult things to deal with. Sorry, I'm not too sure who Thunder Nyan Nyan is and as for where the story is taking place, its before Happosai shows up but after Cologne and Ukyo show up. They don't know any chi-blasts yet. Thanks, I'll try my best to keep my chapters a good quality.</p><p><b>Calamite:</b> Thanks, congrats on beating the boss and good luck on the tank.</p><p><b>Lerris:</b> Well, in a way it isn't a Ranma story and in a way it is. You are right, there is no 'Ranma' in this story and there are several big changes that do have a large ripple effect changing several other points from the original Ranma Universe. Still it does have many of the characters and there is a possibility of there being a Ranma later on after this chapter. Thanks, I'll try my best.</p><p>Thanks Everyone for reading and reviewing,</p><p>Until Next Time,</p><p>Ja Ne</p>
