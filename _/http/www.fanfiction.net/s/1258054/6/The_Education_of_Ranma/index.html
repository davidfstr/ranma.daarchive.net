</div>Disclaimer: Ranma and Company are the creations and property of Rumiko Takahashi. All other characters depicted here are my own.<p>Author's note: It appears that I wasn't as specific as I thought I was in the original note on chapter one concerning the time this story was written. I'll try again.<p>This story was written around thirteen years ago, when Ranma½ was just starting to become the big sensation at the various anime clubs around the nation. The club I attended showed all eighteen episodes of the first series and roughly ten or so of the second, before the person who was bringing the tapes in moved on (That was one of the problems we had. Several members were college students who ultimately graduated and went back home.). Because of this the only characters I knew about at the time were Ranma, Genma, the Tendos, the Kuno siblings, their father, Ryoga, Ukyo, Shampoo, Mikado and Asuza, Cologne, Mousse, and Happosai. I didn't find out about Nodoka or Ms. Hinako until five or six years later. This is the reason for the flavor of most of the stories I have written to date. There will be more on this in a section I will put at this story's end.<p>This leads to a question that I've noticed nobody has really asked yet. Just WHO is Sensei Chan? The clues are there, starting with chapter one. The answer will also be in the section at the end of this series. You may be surprised.<p>Now, on with the story.<br/>Battle Stations! The Invasion of the Campus  (Happosai's Waterloo)<p>It was a couple of days after the Tendos and their guests had visited Ranma at the Great School of Martial Abilities. It was a bright, sunny morning, and everybody had risen early.<p>Kasumi was cleaning the breakfast dishes. Akane was helping her by storing all unessential cookware away. Nabiki had been sent to the market to purchase a few items for the evening meal.<p>Genma Saotome and Soun Tendo were seated across from each other at the low, multipurpose table.<p>"I'm somewhat concerned about Ranma," Genma said.<p>"How so?" Soun asked.<p>"It was his attitude toward the teachers at that school he's attending."<p>"I thought it was a nice, respectful attitude, myself."<p>"That is what concerns me."<p>Soun Tendo looked at his old friend quizzically.<p>At that moment Nabiki came back into the house with a basket of groceries. She set these down on the kitchen counter.<p>"Would you please go check up on Happosai?" Kasumi asked her. "I haven't seen him all morning, and he missed breakfast. I'm getting worried about him."<p>"No need to," Nabiki replied. "I saw him leave just as I was coming in."<p>"Which way did he go?"<p>"In the direction of the bus stop."<p>"OH NO!" Kasumi cried, and she desperately started to look for something in a nearby drawer.<p>Instantly, both Genma and Soun were in the kitchen.<p>"What is it?" Soun cried.<p>"Happosai's gone back to Ranma's school!" Kasumi said in a trembling voice. "He's gone to make up for the time he missed out on this past Saturday!"<p>"Surely, he won't know the way there," Soun tried to assure his daughter.<p>"He's got the invitation with the directions on it!" Kasumi replied.<p>Genma and Soun looked at each other and raced for the front door.<p>"You can forget about that," Nabiki said aloofly. "He's already caught the bus by now."<p>Kasumi raced for the phone and looked in the drawer of the stand it was on.<p>"What are you doing, daughter?" Soun asked.<p>"I'm looking for the phone number for the academy," Kasumi replied frantically. "We've got to warn them!"<p>"I don't know about that," Akane said with a chuckle. "From what we saw Saturday, it's Happosai who needs to be warned."<p>-<p>Sensei Chan answered ringing phone in the main office. She listened intently to the caller for at least a minute.<p>"I see," she said. "We will make the necessary preparations. Thank you for calling."<p>She hung up the phone and stormed out of the room. "Blast!" she exclaimed. "I hate it when classes get disrupted!"<p>She walked straight for the headmistress's office. "Grand Mother must know of this immediately! She will not be pleased!"<p>A few minutes later, the school bell sounded. All the students dropped what they were doing and rushed for the playing field. Sensei Chan came up to speak to them.<p>"I have just been informed that the man you were told about last week is on his way here right now," Sensei Chan said in a loud voice, so everybody could hear. "It appears that he did not learn his lesson this past Saturday. We have a little over thirty minutes to make the necessary preparations to defend this school!<p>"Think of this as a test of the new skills you have learned. Let's do this school proud! Dismissed!"<p>Thirty minutes later, one hundred schoolgirls, a dozen teachers, and one boy sporting a pigtail were standing on the front practice field. "Man your battle stations!" Sensei Chan yelled.<p>The girls immediately broke up into ten groups and scattered. There was one group for each corner of the campus. Another group took position in the central practice courtyard. The other five groups took positions on top of and within the school buildings proper.<p>"Where are the other twenty?" Sensei Chan asked nervously. "I don't see them."<p>"It was their turn to get supplies," Grand Mother replied. "They won't be back for at least fifteen minutes."<p>"We may not have fifteen minutes!" Sensei Chan exclaimed.<p>She was right.<p>"I see him!" a girl on top of the clock tower cried out. "He's within a hundred meters of us and closing fast!"<p>"Is everybody ready?" Sensei Chan demanded, speaking into a handy-talky.<p>One after another, the various groups replied in the affirmative.<p>By this time Happosai had reached the wall. He easily jumped its height and stood on top, surveying the area. All he saw were Ranma and the teaching staff.<p>"I am authorized to give you this warning, Happosai!" Ranma called out. "Leave while you are still able to! Leave this school and its students alone!"<p>"Stay out of my way!" Happosai shot back. "I'm going to teach these girls some real martial arts!"<p>Ranma sighed and shrugged his arms. "You were warned!" he said. "Anything that happens now is on your head!"<p>Happosai ignored him and continued to scan the area for some of the schoolgirls. He finally spotted the group at the corner to his right.<p>Sensei Chan gave a signal, and the girls immediately scattered, reforming several meters away from the main complex.<p>Happosai leaped off the wall in hot pursuit, but failed to make contact, as the girls again scattered the very instant he landed in their spot.<p>Happosai frantically looked around and saw one schoolgirl with a smirk on her face. Her eyes had an "I dare you to try" look in them. Happosai happily obliged.<p>He dashed towards the girl in question, who amazingly stood her ground. He leaped, thrust out an arm, grazed her bosom, and came up empty!<p>Happosai was stunned! He couldn't have missed! He tried again, with the same results. The girl smiled and undid her blouse. Underneath, she wore a full-length swimsuit.<p>Happosai was so taken aback by this that he failed to notice that he was still quite close to the girl. The hearty slap to the cheek she gave him quickly reminded him of that fact.<p>Rubbing his sore cheek, Happosai looked up at the smiling girl. The smile seemed positively wicked now.<p>"That is no way to treat your elders," Happosai sobbed.<p>"I don't treat my elders that way at all," the girl calmly replied. "Then again, my elders would never try to molest me, either."<p>Suddenly, there was a blur of motion, and Happosai was knocked about by several other girls from the group he had tried to attack. He rolled away on the ground, leapt to his feet, and found himself facing Ranma.<p>"Are they all wearing swim suits like the one she is wearing?" he whimpered, pointing to the girl in question.<p>Ranma nodded, and smiled wickedly. He then uncrossed his arms and put a whistle to his lips and blew it once.<p>Immediately, the girls from the other corner came bounding over, ready for a fight.<p>"You can still leave while you're able," Ranma told Happosai.<p>"Never!" Happosai snarled, crossing his arms in defiance. "I will not be beaten by a bunch of unruly students!"<p>Ranma looked back at Sensei Chan. "Now?" he asked.<p>Sensei Chan nodded. Ranma then leapt straight up and flung something into the air.<p>Happosai's eyes widened with ecstasy. A pair of girl's panties! He leapt up after the flung object. His fingers just managed to grab the edge of the waistband when he was suddenly pounded by several kicks, forcing him to release the object of his desire.<p>So intent was Happosai on grabbing the panties that he had completely forgotten about the group of girls charging him from the other side of the field. He hit the ground hard.<p>Ranma calmly picked up the panties from the grass and stuffed them into his pocket. He then bounded away.<p>Happosai got up to chase after him, only to be hit from behind by the girls from his side of the field. Happosai found himself making an impression of his face in the grass.<p>-<p>Ranma dropped down on the covered walkway in front of his room. Beside him was a tray with a bottle of juice and two glasses. Sensei Chan glided up and sat down beside him. Ranma looked at his watch and smiled.<p>Happosai raced past him, right on schedule. There were twenty blurs all around him. Try as he might, he couldn't get away from the girls.<p>Ranma poured himself a drink, then offered one to Sensei Chan, who accepted.<p>"Why aren't you out there with them?" she asked.<p>"I think I'll just sit this one out and enjoy the show," Ranma replied with a smile.<p>He took a sip from his glass. "I think Mariko really got Happosai's goat, catching him off guard like that," he mused.<p>"I think that I need to have a talk with her," Sensei Chan said.<p>"Whatever for?" Ranma queried.<p>"I'm afraid that she has a tendency to go a bit too far at times," Sensei Chan replied. "This was one of them. She might not be so lucky next time."<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders and turned back to the battle at hand.<p>For several minutes, teacher and student watched Happosai vainly try to escape the continually attacking girls. Then he managed to reach the roof above them. Ranma once again produced the whistle and blew two short bursts.<p>The girls on the ground broke off the attack and assumed positions of support for those who were about to take action.<p>Happosai looked down and laughed with glee. He was sure that he had eluded his less experienced pursuers. He was rudely brought back to reality, as he was knocked off the roof from behind.<p>As he fell to the ground, Happosai looked up and saw three girls looking down from the edge of the roof. All had satisfied smiles on their faces.<p>Happosai managed to land on his feet this time, but was immediately accosted by the girls on the ground. He again leapt up to the roof, barely avoiding the trio there, and dashed toward the other side of the building.<p>At this time, the missing twenty girls walked onto the school grounds.<p>Happosai saw them, and, realizing that they were not prepared, like the others, launched his attack.<p>What he hadn't counted on was the swift actions of the teaching staff, the girls being quickly escorted out of the danger zone as the area defenders kept Happosai busy.<p>Ranma looked at Sensei Chan. "Plan B?" he asked. Sensei Chan nodded.<p>Ranma got up and started toward the girls' furoba. The twenty newcomers were already being rushed there, the teachers explaining the situation as they ran. Happosai was close behind.<p>The girls dashed into the furoba, while the teachers disappeared, apparently in an attempt to distract Happosai. Happosai was not distracted, however, and rushed into the room. He stopped and stared in amazement and horror. The large, communal furoba was empty!<p>There was a door on the other side, which was swiftly closing. Happosai looked around desperately, trying to find at least one straggler. There were none.<p>"Tough luck, old man," Ranma smirked from behind. "You can't seem to do anything right today."<p>Happosai turned and glowered at Ranma. Ranma smiled back.<p>"Give it up, 'gramps'," Ranma said sardonically. "You can't win."<p>"You are being impertinent!" was Happosai's angry reply.<p>"So?" asked Ranma in a bored voice. "What are you going to do about it?"<p>Happosai stared in amazement at Ranma. He couldn't believe Ranma's attitude. Ranma had not tried to follow him in, or to fight him alone, but instead had pretty much stayed on the sidelines during the bulk of the battle.<p>"Are you letting girls fight your battles for you?" Happosai taunted.<p>"Not at all," Ranma replied nonchalantly. "The girls are fighting their own battles. I'm just the coach."<p>Happosai was speechless at this.<p>"You surprise me," Ranma said with a smile. "I thought you would have tried to leave this room by now. After all, there are twenty nubile young ladies who are probably in their underwear right about now."<p>No! Happosai started to sweat. Twenty scantily clad teenage girls somewhere on campus and Ranma was keeping him here!<p>"Then there is the matter of the other girls' underwear," Ranma said, twirling the pair of panties he had pocketed earlier around his left forefinger. "Only I know where they are, and I can assure you that it is not the laundry room."<p>Ranma emitted a wicked laugh. Happosai trembled with rage. "How dare you keep me from my simple pleasures!" he erupted. "You need to be disciplined!"<p>"Any time you're ready, pops," Ranma taunted.<p>Happosai angrily leapt forward. Ranma easily dodged the attack, turned a hundred and eighty degrees, and watched with satisfaction as Happosai was beset by a fresh group of girls.<p>-<p>Ranma calmly walked out of the furoba and looked down on the prone form of Happosai. "What are you doing, wasting time here for?" he asked. "There are twenty girls awaiting your presence in the east dormitory."<p>Happosai got up in a flash and ran for the dormitory. He literally ran up the side of the building and leaped headfirst through a window. He promptly flew out of the same window a second later.<p>"Did I neglect to mention that while we were discussing the merits of standing around doing nothing, the defenders from the far wall were rushing here to protect their comrades' modesty?" Ranma asked Happosai in a patronizing tone.<p>Happosai immediately leapt up and rocketed toward the open window. A frying pan magically appeared and knocked him back down again. Happosai, now sporting a sizable lump on his head, jumped up a third time. He gleefully looked into the open window. A fist shot out and got him in the eye.<p>Happosai, lump on head, left eye closed and turning purple, lay on the grass and moaned. Ranma knelt down beside him. "Just what are those girls doing, preventing you from entering?" he said in mock sympathy. "They need to be taught a lesson! You should go up there and discipline them!"<p>Happosai slowly got up, but this time he decided to try the ground floor entrance. He staggered to the door, opened it, and was promptly sent flying backwards by a roundhouse kick.<p>Happosai began to get up again, very slowly this time. He then heard a shout from above. He looked up and saw several girls leaping down from the second floor windows. He barely had time to dodge as they landed.<p>Ranma started to walk away slowly. He whistled as he walked and he twirled a key ring on the fingers of his right hand. Happosai saw the key ring, leapt forward, snatched it, and dashed off to a storage shed that had the same number as the key.<p>Happosai was exuberant. Ranma had become too cocky. He had given away the location of the laundry bags. Happosai could hardly contain himself. He would soon be hip deep in panties!<p>Happosai reached the shed, unlocked the door, and was immediately beset by a dozen girls. He fled the shed yelping in pain. The girls gave pursuit.<p>Happosai couldn't understand it. Things like this had never happened before. He always achieved his goal, always!<p>This time, however, he had failed. This was a big blow to his ego. What he didn't know was that the worst was yet to come.<p>In trying to escape the dozen guards, Happosai ran through the central courtyard. At least he tried to. He was stopped by the sight of over fifty girls standing along the walkways surrounding the courtyard.<p>Happosai surveyed his tormentors warily. He made a thorough investigation of the best possible escape routes. He prepared to fight in earnest.<p>The girls smiled at him. They seemed harmless, even playful. Happosai sensed a trap.<p>Suddenly, there was blur of arms, and several dozen panties flew into the air! Happosai could not contain himself, and he leapt up after them. As before, he was pummeled by several girls employing flying kicks. When he came down again this time, he did not even attempt to rise.<p>The girls proceeded to pick up the scattered panties. Not one pair had been successfully snatched by Happosai. They all turned and looked at the man. He lay unconscious on the ground.<p>Some school attendants came up and put Happosai on a stretcher, then took him away to the infirmary. There came three short tweets on a whistle, then all the girls leaped into the air and began cheering.<p>-<p>Kasumi, Nabiki, Akane, and Genma alighted from the bus, then waited impatiently for Soun, who was momentarily detained.<p>"We have to hurry!" Kasumi cried. "There is no telling what damage he is doing in that school!"<p>"But we can't run there!" Nabiki exclaimed. "It's over a kilometer away!"<p>"Walk quickly, then!" Kasumi cried. "We've no time to lose!"<p>The group ran as fast as they could and soon reached the gates of the martial arts academy. Kasumi insistently pulled the bell cord. The massive gate opened and Sensei Chan poked her head out.<p>"More uninvited guests?" she laughed. "This is becoming a very busy day!"<p>"Come in! Come in!" she said exuberantly. "The more the merrier!"<p>"We've come to warn you about Happosai and help stop him, if possible," Kasumi panted.<p>"No need to," Sensei Chan assured her. "Everything has been taken care of."<p>She motioned to the main complex. There, standing in a double row, were the one hundred and twenty female students of the academy. Walking between them were two attendants carrying a stretcher. On the stretcher was Happosai. He was strapped firmly in place.<p>Ranma waited at the end of the double column. He, like the girls, stood at attention. As the stretcher-bearers came near, they stopped and placed the stretcher at Ranma's feet.<p>Ranma knelt down and looked at the thoroughly wasted Happosai. "Time to go home, old man," he said softly.<p>"Tell me one thing," Happosai whispered. "How were these girls able to stop me?"<p>"Simple, 'gramps'," Ranma replied. "There are two reasons for your defeat. One: these girls are martial artists, not the schoolgirls that you are used to; and two: these girls trust me."<p>"I don't understand," Happosai said weakly.<p>"They are not like the girls back at the old neighborhood. They don't make snap judgments about people. I told them all about you, your strengths and weaknesses, and my relationship to you. We then made battle plans from there. I was made commanding officer of the school's defense forces, and the girls have been practicing their tactics under my direction for over a week now. You see, we've been expecting you since before the Saturday visit. You really didn't have a prayer of defeating us."<p>Ranma then stood up and motioned the attendants to take Happosai away. He then turned and bowed to the assembled girls, who bowed back. There was a sharp clap of hands from the side, and the girls dispersed.<p>While Ranma had been talking to Happosai, both Akane and Nabiki had been racing up to investigate the situation. They were both stunned by Ranma's remark about the girls at the academy trusting him. Nabiki became more than a little intrigued by it.<p>Ranma turned around and greeted the two sisters. "How nice of you to come," he said. "However, it turns out that your help was unnecessary. As you can see, Happosai has been dealt with."<p>"How?" Nabiki exclaimed.<p>"Let's just say that he got more than he bargained for," Ranma laughed.<p>"It is a pity that you couldn't get here earlier," Ranma told the two girls, as they all walked back to the gate. "I think that you two would have enjoyed the show immensely."<p>"We tried to call," Kasumi was telling Sensei Chan, as Ranma and the girls came up, "but the phone was out of order."<p>"Happosai pulled the cord out of the wall socket," Nabiki explained.<p>"That man has no respect for private property," Soun muttered angrily. "Can you imagine the repair bill?"<p>"You couldn't have reached us anyway," Sensei Chan said with a laugh.<p>"Why not?" Kasumi asked.<p>"Because I was on the phone, being informed of Happosai's plans," Sensei Chan replied.<p>"But how is that possible?" Kasumi exclaimed.<p>"We have our ways," Sensei Chan mysteriously replied.<p>She turned to the two attendants with the stretcher. "Please accompany these kind people to the bus stop," she told them.<p>Everybody said their goodbyes, with the exception of Happosai, and Ranma went back to his studies. The Tendos and Genma walked solemnly back down the road to the bus stop.<p>On the way home, Akane could think of only one thing. Ranma told Happosai that the girls at the academy trusted him. Just what type of relationship does he have with them? she thought.<p>Akane mulled that thought over well into the night.<p>To be continued...<p>Next time: Ranma and the girls get a day off and decide to paint the town. Also: Akane finds out the hard way just how well Ranma has learned his lessons.<p>Until then, ciao!
