</div>Disclaimer: Ranma and company are owned by Rumiko Takahashi. All other characters in this story are my own.<p>PROGRESS<p>Ranma awoke bright and early and prepared for breakfast. At the communal mess hall, he ate his simple breakfast of rice and fish, and then took his plates to the kitchen. He then set out in search of Sensei Chan.<p>Sensei Chan was reading the day's schedule to the assembled students as Ranma came up.<p>"Ah, there you are," she said. "You are just in time. Practice begins in five minutes."<p>"What's on today's agenda?" Ranma asked.<p>"Body toughening."<p>"Body toughening? How?"<p>"You'll see," Sensei Chan said.<p>It was a few minutes later when Ranma and Sensei Chan met at the northwest section of the campus. "This is where we will toughen your body," Sensei Chan said.<p>She pulled a rope and a large, six-foot high punching bag dropped into view from a high scaffold. A rope and harness dropped a few feet away.<p>"We will put you into that harness and swing you against the sack. As time goes by, we will fill the sack with harder materials, though nothing too hard. This will toughen your body so that you will be able to withstand most blows."<p>"Ryoga did the same thing under Shampoo's great grandmother's tutelage," Ranma said excitedly.<p>"He did indeed," replied Sensei Chan. "However, his was a rushed training program and didn't fully take. Have you noticed that he isn't that tough any more?"<p>Ranma admitted that he had noticed that.<p>"In order for the exercise to be truly effective, it must be done slowly and repeatedly, strengthening the body bit by bit. One then must exercise at least three times a week in order to maintain one's new body," Sensei Chan said. "Ryoga never did that."<p>Ranma looked with amazement at Sensei Chan and she laughed for a few seconds. Ranma was incredulous. He couldn't figure out how Sensei Chan knew so much about him, Shampoo, and Ryoga. It was amazing, the vast amount of knowledge she had.<p>Ranma got into the harness at Sensei Chan's command, and was then hoisted up into the air.<p>"The trick is to hit the bag head on," Sensei Chan directed. "After that, you do the same with your back. Do you understand that?"<p>Ranma nodded. Sensei Chan gave the signal, and Ranma found himself flying into the large sack again and again. This lasted for about half an hour.<p>"That's enough for now," Sensei Chan said. "We will have another session this afternoon."<p>Ranma was brought back down and released from the harness. He was sweating up a storm.<p>"Perhaps you would like to freshen up before continuing," Sensei Chan advised. Ranma agreed.<p>-<p>While in the shower stall, Ranma was mulling over the names of the other teachers. As he exited the bath-house, he asked Sensei Chan about them.<p>"I overheard you mention one of the other teacher's names as 'Master Chang' yesterday," he said. "Isn't that Chinese?"<p>"Yes it is," Sensei Chan laughed. "He is called that because of his skills in the Kempo School of Karate."<p>"Kempo!" Ranma cried out excitedly. "That's my specialty!"<p>"We know," Sensei Chan laughed. "You will be practicing with Master Chang in a few days time, after we have settled on a practical schedule."<p>"What's next on the agenda?" Ranma asked.<p>"Next, we start you out on exercises for the 'Exploding Point Technique'," Sensei Chan replied.<p>"The 'Exploding Point Technique," Ranma cried out, more excitedly than before.<p>"Yes," was Sensei Chan's calm, but happy reply. "In order to defeat one's enemies, one must know their secrets. When you learn how to use the technique, you will learn how to counteract it as well."<p>"This is just the beginning, Ranma," Sensei Chan continued in an excited voice. "Over the next several weeks, we will be going over several skills and abilities that should come in handy from time to time. We will discuss their merits, their strengths, and their weaknesses. By the end of the term, you should be able to counteract most of the attacks that could be used on you. Just think of how you will be able to outfight your opponents, then!"<p>Ranma did indeed imagine that possibility, and a great smile formed on his face.<p>"Now come along, Ranma, and we'll show you how to properly prepare yourself for the 'Exploding Point Technique'."<p>Ranma raced after Sensei Chan as she led him to the dojo especially designed for the task. The smile on his face grew even wider.<p>-<p>As the days went by, Ranma pretty much fell into a routine. In the early morning, he would do his usual exercises. After breakfast, he would have a training session with Master Chang. After that, there was toughening practice, then exercises in how to hold the fingers for the 'Exploding Point Technique', with practice jabs on various objects.<p>After lunch, the Shadow Master, so called because he was well versed in the arts of Ninjitsu, instructed Ranma. Speed, stealth, and balance were taught in rapid succession. After that, Sensei Chan would show Ranma a new fighting technique. Sometimes another teacher, like Grand Mother, or Mistress Swan, would show Ranma a new move or technique. He then did his afternoon toughening exercises.<p>After the toughening exercises, Ranma would hit the books for a couple of hours, then practice some more before dinner. An evening meditation, some more studying, and some pleasurable reading finished up the day.<p>"Remember to do all your morning practicing in female form," Sensei Chan had told him early on.<p>"I'm not so sure that's such a good idea," Ranma had replied in a worried voice.<p>"Not to worry, lad," Sensei Chan had replied. "I will ensure that no one shall disturb you while you practice. It is considered to be a very personal affair in this school. Nobody is allowed to interrupt. We are very severe to anybody who does."<p>"By then, it will be too late," Ranma said in a more worried voice.<p>"The girls are well versed in the rules here. They will not bother you. I will insure that myself."<p>So Ranma began doing his exercises in female form. To insure his anonymity, he was given a special, out of the way spot, where the others had been forbidden to go. Everything worked out quite nicely.<p>On the seventh day of his stay, Sensei Chan once again tried to help Ranma with his phobia.<p>"This time we will go a little more slowly," she said.<p>After sitting Ranma down on the ground, Sensei Chan produced a kitten. "Let us see if we can get used to this little one, shall we?" she said.<p>Ranma began to sweat. "Do not worry, Ranma," Sensei Chan said. "I'm right beside you."<p>She placed the kitten in front of Ranma. "Just reach out and touch it. You have nothing to fear."<p>"I can't," Ranma quavered. "I keep seeing all those angry cats I faced so many years ago."<p>"The story of your life, eh, Ranma?" Sensei Chan said compassionately. "Everybody blames you for things you have never done. Cats, individuals, even entire groups. The cats can be forgiven, not knowing any better, but people are something else entirely. They, at least, should think everything through before acting.<p>"The cats you faced had no way of knowing that you were not responsible for their bad treatment. They were just venting their feelings at their supposed tormenter. Cats are actually very friendly animals, once you get to know them. Now, reach out and touch the little fellow."<p>Ranma gingerly reached out and touched the kitten. The kitten started to purr.<p>"See?" Sensei Chan said. "He likes you!"<p>"He does?" Ranma said in a wavering voice. "How can you tell?"<p>"By the sound he's making, silly. Cats always purr when they like somebody, or are happy. Now try stroking him across the back."<p>Ranma complied.<p>"Gently, gently. There, that's the way. Listen to him purr! You really have a way with cats, Ranma," Sensei Chan said.<p>"I do?" Ranma asked in a small voice, eyes wide as saucers.<p>"You do," Sensei Chan said soothingly. "He's really purring now."<p>Ranma continued to pet the kitten for several minutes.<p>"That will do for today," Sensei Chan said, gently taking the kitten away from Ranma. "We will try for a little longer tomorrow."<p>Ranma sighed with relief.<p>"Remember, Ranma," Sensei Chan said. "Cats will only bare their fangs and claws in self defense. If you don't hurt them, they won't hurt you. Now, let's get on with the next lesson."<p>-<p>It was another week before Akane could sneak away from the house again and see what Ranma was up to. This time she took the morning bus, so she could observe the school and its routines all day.<p>She again climbed up the wall and peered over the same spot as she had done the first time. The crates were of great help. Akane wondered, however, why they hadn't been taken away yet. Secure in the knowledge that nobody knew she was there, however, eased her fears. No doubt it was just too much trouble for the people in the area to bother with.<p>As she peeked over the wall, Akane saw Ranma training with some of the female students. He was giving a couple of them some pointers on improving their techniques. Akane bristled at the sight. Nobody had informed the family that there would be other students at the school, much less girls.<p>Akane peered around and saw several more girls walking from class to class. Try as she might, she could not spot any other boys. She began to get very worried about this. For all intents and purposes, Ranma was the only boy on the whole campus!<p>Just what were Sensei Chan's plans for Ranma? Why was he the only boy on campus? Akane began to get very nervous, indeed.<p>A movement caught Akane's eye. She turned her head and saw Sensei Chan coming toward the small group of students. Akane, who by this time had secured the top of the wall, flattened down, so as not to be seen.<p>"There you are," Sensei Chan said. "I see that you are helping the others with their lessons. Good. Very good."<p>"Is there anything you need of me, sensei?" Ranma asked.<p>"No," Sensei Chan said with a laugh. "I'm just here to inform you that I will be away from campus for a few hours. Master Chang will be taking over my duties while I'm away."<p>Sensei Chan turned to leave. "I'll be back shortly," she said. "Carry on!"<p>Akane watched Sensei Chan leave the area and head for the gate. This was as good a time as any to confront her.<p>As Sensei Chan walked down the road away from the martial arts academy, she suddenly found herself facing Akane. "Well, what brings you around here?" she asked.<p>"I came about Ranma," Akane said evenly. "I want to see him."<p>"I'm afraid that's impossible at the moment," Sensei Chan said in a soft voice. "Visitor's day is not until next Saturday. We are very strict about that. Only emergency situations are excepted."<p>"This is an emergency," Akane said irately. "I want to know what you're doing with Ranma! Just what is going on in there?"<p>"That does not sound like an emergency to me," Sensei Chan replied with a laugh. "It sounds more like feminine curiosity. I'm afraid that you will have to wait until Saturday."<p>Akane looked at Sensei Chan steadily. "I know that you are up to something in there! I will find out what it is one way or another."<p>"Amazing," said Sensei Chan. "You really are worried about the boy! This is truly amazing!"<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"Well, what with all the times you've fought with him, slapped him, and brained him, we generally thought that you wanted nothing to do with him. This is a refreshing change."<p>"My only interest is that of a concerned citizen, nothing more," Akane said evenly.<p>"Sure, sure," Sensei Chan said in a patronizing voice. "Whatever you say."<p>Akane glared at her and almost screamed the words. "Just what are your intentions toward Ranma?"<p>"I don't believe it! You are jealous!" Sensei Chan laughed with glee. "You actually think I have designs on Ranma? Good heavens, child, I'm old enough to be his mother!"<p>"That's not what I mean, and you know it!" Akane said irately.<p>"Well, it is the only thing that comes to mind. He is a rather handsome lad, you know."<p>"Now, if you will excuse me, I have an appointment," Sensei Chan said. "I am already running late. We will have to discuss this obsession of yours at a later date. Until then, farewell!"<p>Akane glared at Sensei Chan as she continued down the path, and gritted her teeth. Whatever secret was being kept from her would not be a secret much longer. Akane ran back for the wall.<p>Sensei Chan continued on her way. She soon came upon a small dwelling, which she entered. She entered a large room and sat down at a table that was already surrounded by several men and women, all of who wore clothing similar to her own. All wore the same wide, bowl shaped hat as well.<p>"You have arrived," said one of the mysterious figures, sitting at the head of the table. The voice was feminine, but had a quality of command to it.<p>"What is your report?" the leader of the group asked.<p>"All is going according to plan," Sensei Chan replied. "Ranma is making excellent progress. He should be ready in about a year's time."<p>"And the girl?" the mysterious figure asked.<p>"Although she refused our offer, she has been secretly coming out to see Ranma's progress. I walked into her while on the way here today. She is very upset with what is going on."<p>"And where is she now?"<p>"Back up on the wall, I imagine," Sensei Chan laughed.<p>Akane would have been amazed to hear that her presence on the school grounds was known from the first.<p>"She is a stubborn one, I take it?" the leader asked.<p>"Quite stubborn," Sensei Chan replied. "She refuses to accept the fact that deep within her, she has feelings for Ranma. At the same time, she apparently is worried about his well being while he is our guest.<p>"She is highly suspicious of us, particularly of me. She seems to have gotten it into her head that we mean to harm Ranma in some way."<p>"How can that be, when we only have his best interests at heart?"<p>"I have no idea. The only theory that makes sense is that subconscious feeling for him that I mentioned earlier. Some part of her must really care about him."<p>"And yet, she refused to accompany him to the school," mused the leader of the group.<p>"A most curious girl, to be sure," another figure interjected in a masculine voice.<p>"We will continue to keep surveillance on her to insure that she doesn't interfere with our plans for Ranma," the mysterious leader directed. "He must be allowed to improve himself as much as possible. Nothing must interfere with this goal."<p>The whole group murmured in agreement.<p>"How is the phobia cure coming along?" the leader asked Sensei Chan.<p>"Better than I hoped for," Sensei Chan replied. "We made some great progress today. He is up to ten minutes with a kitten in his lap, now."<p>"Very good, but what do you mean by 'hoped for'?" said the leader.<p>"We could only get him for two months, so I cannot verify just how far we will get in totally curing the phobia."<p>"That is sad, but cannot be helped. Just do the best you can."<p>"Yes ma'am," Sensei Chan replied. "Hopefully, he will get enough of a start to complete the cure himself."<p>"We can only hope," said the leader.<p>She then looked around the table and asked, "Is there any other pressing business for this branch of our school?" The others shook their heads.<p>"Very well, then," the mysterious woman said. "This meeting is adjourned. We will meet again in two weeks. Please keep in touch until then."<p>Everybody got up from the table and filed out of the room. They then filed out of the house and went their separate ways.<p>Sensei Chan went straight to the market to get some supplies, this being the excuse she would give Ranma for her absence that day, if he asked. She would also tell of the meeting, but be very vague about it. Ranma would assume that Sensei Chan had quite a few errands to perform, and accept her explanations.<p>-<p>Akane had noticed the group of people leaving the house from her perch on the wall. She couldn't understand why so many people were milling about a supposedly abandoned structure. Her suspicions were aroused even more by the event.<p>She tried to locate Ranma again, but was unsuccessful. He was in the rear courtyard, doing his afternoon toughening practice, and was thus hidden from all prying eyes.<p>Akane sighed and decided to leave the area. It was a good time to catch the bus home, anyway. She didn't want to be gone too long from home.<p>On the way back, Akane once again bumped into Sensei Chan, who was carrying a bag of groceries. "So, we meet again!" Sensei Chan exclaimed. "Have you found anything more suspicious about the school?"<p>"Very funny!" Akane snapped. "Just where is Ranma at?"<p>"Well, if he is sticking to his schedule, he should be performing his toughening exercises," Sensei Chan replied matter of factly. "They are done at the rear of the school. Not to worry, though. We'll make sure his cheeks are as tender as ever!"<p>Sensei Chan laughed and went on her way. Akane glared at her for a few seconds, then continued on down the road to the bus stop.<p>Sensei Chan looked back and saw her leave. Poor Akane, she thought. You have such a large chip on your shoulder. We could have helped you, had you wanted. Now, I believe, Ranma will have to teach you your lessons.<p>With that, Sensei Chan returned to the school.<p>To be continued...<p>Next Time: Ranma is asked to teach the other students some important lessons. Is he up to the task?
