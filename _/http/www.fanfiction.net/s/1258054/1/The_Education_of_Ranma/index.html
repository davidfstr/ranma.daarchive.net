</div>Author's notes: This is a story that I wrote over twelve years ago, when the Ranma ½ series first came to America via Anime clubs, so it may seem a bit dated. However, I do believe that you will enjoy it.<p>Ranma and company are owned by Rumiko Takahashi. All other characters are my own.<p>SENSEI CHAN<p>The mysterious woman walked calmly but purposefully down the dusty road. She appeared to be on a mission of great importance, as indicated by her intense stride.<p>At first glance, people who saw her thought they were seeing a man walk by, due to her highly unusual garb. The clothes she wore were of the traditional kind worn by a male warrior or monk of the sixteenth century. These included a greyish-brown hakama; a matching haori, and a wide, bowl shaped straw hat, which hid her features. Only a bulge in the upper section of the shirt and the long, shoulder length hair gave any indication of the woman's true gender.<p>On the woman's feet were the traditional wooden clogs that had been prevalent in the past few centuries, but which were now relegated to historical dramas and special ceremonies. In one hand she carried a staff which was taller than she was, which was a marvel in itself, as the woman was well above average height.<p>The woman walked along the streets of the community until she reached a rather large house with a large courtyard and encircling wall. She marched through the gate and up to the front entrance and rang the bell. A young woman of around nineteen or twenty answered the door.<p>"Is this the Tendo residence?" the stranger asked.<p>"Yes, it is," replied the young woman politely.<p>"Does a Genma Saotome live here at this time?" queried the woman.<p>"Yes," the young woman replied.<p>"Does he have a son named Ranma, by any chance?"<p>"Yes, he does. Both are currently at home."<p>"I would like to see both him and his son, please," the woman requested.<p>"Please come in," the younger woman said. "I will fetch them immediately."<p>Ranma and Akane were having another of their interminable arguments when Nabiki came rushing into the room. "There's a woman here to see you, Ranma!" she said excitedly.<p>Ranma, who had been speaking at that moment, stopped in mid sentence and glanced at Nabiki in amazement. "A woman? Here to see me?"<p>"Yes," replied Nabiki. "Both you and your father."<p>As Ranma followed Nabiki out of the room and down the stairs, Akane could hear him mutter, "Great! What trouble has my old man gotten me into now?"<p>-<p>As Ranma neared the bottom of the stairs, Kasumi was bringing Genma into the hallway. Soun Tendo was close behind. The newcomer was calmly standing near the front door, the staff lying next to the wall.<p>"Are you Genma Saotome?" she asked.<p>"Yes," replied Genma.<p>"You have a son named Ranma Saotome?"<p>"Yes," Genma replied a second time. "Here he comes now." He pointed toward the staircase.<p>The stranger watched Ranma descend the stairs with intense interest. It was as if she were examining him closely. She nodded her head, as if in approval of what she saw.<p>Akane had followed Ranma down the stairs, curious as to what was going on. Forgotten was the argument she had been having with Ranma and its cause. All her attention was now focused on the newcomer.<p>Ranma came to the foot of the stairs, turned, and bowed to the newcomer.<p>"So you are Ranma," the woman said. "You are every bit as impressive as I have been told."<p>Ranma bowed at the compliment. Genma scrutinized the woman closely.<p>"Why are you here?" he finally asked.<p>"I am called Sensei Chan," the woman replied. "I represent the Great School of Martial Abilities.<p>"We have heard of your son and of his great achievements. I have been sent to see both him and you, and to discuss certain matters of import."<p>"Do you wish to challenge him?" Genma queried.<p>"Not at all," was the woman's calm reply, much to Ranma's relief. "I am here to enroll him in our school."<p>Everybody stared at the woman in amazement. "You want to what?" Genma exclaimed.<p>"I wish to negotiate Ranma's enrollment in the school I teach at."<p>"I don't understand," a flabbergasted Genma said.<p>"The Great School of Martial Abilities trains only the best and brightest of students," the woman said. "We have been watching Ranma for some time now, and believe that he qualifies in both categories. We wish to expand his education and increase his skills. It would be a wonderful opportunity for him to advance in rank."<p>"You wish to teach me?" Ranma said, with a touch of awe.<p>"Yes," was Sensei Chan's calm reply.<p>"No!" was Genma's emphatic answer. He had not even mulled the matter over.<p>Ranma looked in amazement at his father. He couldn't figure out why Genma was against such a golden opportunity.<p>"What reason do you give for this answer?" Sensei Chan queried. "Many people would give their eye teeth for this kind of opportunity. We rarely give it out freely."<p>"I am all the teacher that Ranma needs," replied Genma gruffly. "What I can't give him can be supplied by my friend Soun here."<p>"I see," Sensei Chan said. "And what does the boy have to say in this matter?"<p>"He has no say at all in it," was Genma's emphatic reply.<p>"You would deny your son the chance to better himself?" asked Sensei Chan, her voice still calm.<p>"What do you mean, deny?" Genma asked accusingly.<p>"We can teach him things that few other people know about. Are you sure that you can provide the same?"<p>"I cannot believe that there are skills and techniques that I haven't been taught," Genma said stiffly.<p>"Oh, there are, there are," the mysterious woman laughed.<p>Genma remained silent and just glared at the woman.<p>Sensei Chan shook her head. "Surely Ranma should be able to decide what he can and cannot learn. He is of the age where he can make his own decisions."<p>"NO!" was Genma's sharp reply. "I will decide what he will learn and when he will learn it!"<p>"I see," Sensei Chan replied, no change in her voice. "You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?"<p>Genma looked at her, dumbfounded.<p>Sensei Chan reached into her robes and produced a small packet, which she tossed to Genma. Genma, caught off guard, barely caught it.<p>"Do you recognize this?" Sensei Chan asked, indicating the packet. Genma shook his head.<p>"Think back roughly eleven or twelve years, Mr. Saotome. You and your young son had traveled a long distance and needed a place to stay where you could rest. You found such a place in a small school."<p>"So?" Genma asked suspiciously. "What does that have to do with Ranma's training?"<p>"The school was one of many branches of the Great School of Martial Abilities. We took you in, cared for you, and looked after your son. As we did so, we found that he had great potential as a martial artist.<p>"In gratitude for our services, you promised that we could participate in the boy's training, come the proper time. That time has come."<p>"And what is in this packet?"<p>"The written agreement that you signed those many years ago!"<p>Genma looked dumbfoundedly at Sensei Chan, who looked bemusedly back at him. He opened the packet, pulled out a small scroll, and began to read it. His eyes widened with horror at what he read.<p>As he tried to fumble for something to say, Sensei Chan turned to Ranma. "Do you remember a middle aged woman who called herself Mistress Dove?"<p>Ranma thought hard for a few seconds. Then his eyes glowed with recognition. "Yes!" he cried excitedly. "She was a very nice woman who cared for me like I was a member of her family!"<p>"Well, she gave us quite a glowing report of your abilities at such a young age. We were quite impressed, and therefore made plans to help in your education. You may just be the one we are looking for."<p>"Huh?" Ranma asked. Sensei Chan passed the remark off as inconsequential. "You will learn all later," she said. "Right now, we must get you properly trained."<p>"What if I refuse to go along with this 'deal'?" Genma asked suspiciously.<p>"It was thought that you would initially refuse," Sensei Chan said. "It was agreed that a demonstration of my abilities might be appropriate. I am therefore authorized by my fellow instructors to put the issue to a challenge."<p>"What sort of challenge?" Genma asked suspiciously.<p>"Trial by combat," Sensei Chan replied. "A match between you and me. If you win, then the favor is void and Ranma stays here with you. If I win, then he can decide for himself whether or not he stays or leaves."<p>Sensei Chan looked at Genma intently. "Do you accept?" she asked.<p>"Wait a minute!" Soun exclaimed. "I have a stake in this as well!"<p>His daughters stared at him with horror. Sensei Chan seemed not to notice this.<p>"What is your request?" she asked.<p>"That I be allowed to challenge you as well!" Soun replied vehemently. I also want Ranma to remain here!"<p>"Very well," Sensei Chan said calmly. "You may participate as well."<p>"Me too!" screamed the tiny voice of Happosai, as he leaped into the courtyard. "That boy is to be my successor! I demand full control over that process!"<p>"Fine. All three of you, then," Sensei Chan said with a smile. She began to doff her sandals. The hat remained in place.<p>"Shall we adjourn to the dojo?" she asked.<p>"The courtyard and hallways will do fine," was Genma's grim reply.<p>"Why do you want Ranma?" Kasumi asked, as the group moved to the courtyard.<p>"We believe that he is good enough to be enrolled in our school," was the reply. "It is considered a great honor by several of us to have him as a student."<p>"But you said earlier that he showed great potential."<p>"That is why we wish to enroll him."<p>Suddenly, Genma lashed out with a violent kick. Sensei Chan blocked it easily, and tripped Genma up. "Good move," she said, "but not unexpected."<p>"What's the deal?" Nabiki asked, as Genma regained his feet and renewed his attack.<p>"We will have Ranma for the next sixty days," replied Sensei Chan, as she avoided Genma's charge and parried Soun's attack. "We would like to have him longer, perhaps a year, but unfortunately, we lack the facilities at present to provide him with a decent education for such a period of time.<p>"Therefore, he will be returned in two month's time to continue his education at the local high school, which should not take that long, considering his remarkable achievements to date."<p>Sensei Chan avoided Genma's second charge with ease, and continued to speak, as Genma plowed into Soun. "You will all be able to visit him from time to time, and Ranma will be allowed to leave on occasion, the number of times depending on how well he learns his lessons. Outside of that, he will eat, sleep, and practice on the school grounds."<p>Genma charged a third time, missed, and slammed into the front door.<p>"Are we agreed, then?" Sensei Chan asked in a bored voice.<p>"Yes," Genma replied, panting. He prepared to charge again.<p>"Good," replied Sensei Chan. "Let us do battle in earnest, then."<p>All three girls and Ranma listened in amazement to this last statement. For all intents and purposes, Sensei Chan was barely getting warmed up from the workout so far. The true battle was just starting.<p>Genma attacked and found himself flying into the courtyard. The others watched in amazement at this feat.<p>Soun let loose with a roundhouse kick, only to be blocked by Sensei Chan. He then found himself being used to knock Genma down again. So fast did Sensei Chan move, that nobody saw her grab Soun until it was too late.<p>Both men tried to get up, but slumped back to the ground. Happosai came flying through the air, only to be knocked back with a vicious backhand. He bounced off the far wall and slammed into the floor.<p>"A predictable attack," Sensei Chan said in a bored voice. "Easily parried. You disappoint me, sir. I expected much stronger opposition."<p>There was no reply from Happosai, who was now counting the stars swimming around his head. Genma and Soun were likewise occupied.<p>"Well," said Sensei Chan, "it would appear that I have won the match. What is your decision, Ranma?"<p>"I've got to pack some things," said Ranma excitedly. "I'll be back down in ten minutes!"<p>"I'll be waiting," replied Sensei Chan with a smile.<p>Ranma raced up the stairs, with Akane in hot pursuit.<p>-<p>As Ranma stuffed his backpack, Akane said incredulously, "You're not really going with her, are you?"<p>"You're darn right, I am," Ranma replied. "Did you see what she just did? She defeated your father, my old man, and 'grandfather' Happosai in just a few minutes! Just imagine the things I could learn from her!" There was awe in Ranma's voice.<p>"Well, I think you should remain here," Akane exclaimed in a haughty voice. "You've no business going out with strangers, no matter what the reason."<p>"A true student of the martial arts never passes up a chance to improve his skills," Ranma replied. "Anyway, you were a stranger to me when we first met. Should I avoid you?"<p>"That was different! You live here, now. Your arrival was already being prepared for! This Sensei Chan per-son is something else entirely! Her background is totally unknown! She is a total stranger!"<p>"So were all the other instructors I have met over the years," Ranma replied, as he donned his backpack, "and they turned out to be decent people. Why should this time be any different?"<p>"It's just a feeling I have," Akane said. "I don't trust her."<p>Ranma, however, was beyond hearing, as he was racing down the hallway. Akane gave chase.<p>Ranma was already by Sensei Chan's side when Akane was halfway down the stairs. Sensei Chan looked up at her and smiled.<p>"Would you like to join us?" she asked. "We actually have two openings and you also have shown great promise."<p>"No, thanks," replied Akane abruptly. "I'd rather remain here."<p>"Very well," Sensei Chan said. "The choice is yours to make. It is a pity, though. We would have loved to have you for a student. Perhaps another time."<p>"Perhaps," said Akane, looking steadily at the woman. Ranma seemed not to notice, as he opened the front door and stepped out.<p>"Please wait for me at the gate," Sensei Chan directed. "I'll be out in a few minutes."<p>She turned to Kasumi and handed her some papers. "Please insure that Mr. Saotome signs these," she re-quested. "It confirms our agreement. A messenger will be along in a couple of days to pick up our copy."<p>With that, she left the house and joined up with Ranma. Both looked back at the house and waved goodbye. Both Kasumi and Nabiki waved back, but Akane just stood there and fumed.<p>-<p>As Ranma and Sensei Chan walked along the road under the hot summer sun, Ranma put forth a query.<p>"Why do you have the name 'Sensei Chan'?"<p>"I chose it."<p>"Huh?" Ranma grunted.<p>"At the Great School of Martial Abilities all teachers are referred to by special names which denote their rank or specialty. We can think up the name ourselves."<p>"But why 'Sensei Chan?'" Ranma asked. "You are calling yourself 'teacher' as if it's a proper name."<p>"Let's just say that I'm eccentric, and leave it at that," the mysterious woman replied with a smile.<p>"But you also use the word 'Chan', rather than 'San'. Why?"<p>"It keeps me humble."<p>"One other question, if you don't mind," Ranma said respectfully.<p>"Fire away!" replied Sensei Chan.<p>"Why are you wearing the traditional male clothes of the sixteenth century?"<p>"Why not?"<p>Ranma shrugged. "That's as good an answer as any," he said.<p>Sensei Chan laughed. "Actually, I find these quite comfortable," she said.<p>Woman and boy continued down the road out of town. After a while, a fourth question came to Ranma's mind. "Of all the potential students in this area, why did you pick me?"<p>"As I told your father, we have been watching you for a long time. We study all potential applicants very closely before we make a decision on whether or not to accept them. We have been following you around for several months, now."<p>"If that is so, then why haven't I seen any of you?" Ranma asked.<p>"We are very unobtrusive," Sensei Chan replied. "We do not want people to know that we are watching them. It makes them very nervous and suspicious. This tends to mar any attempt in gauging their skills and abilities."<p>"Oh," Ranma murmured, nodding his head slightly.<p>"Also, by studying the potential student for a while, we can find out his or her strengths and weaknesses before hand, thus saving valuable time. Our primary goal is to eliminate those weaknesses and improve upon the strengths. For this, we need to know everything possible about our students so that we may begin immediately."<p>"Everything?" Ranma gulped nervously.<p>"Everything," replied Sensei Chan with a smile. "Do not worry. Your secret is safe with us. We have taken a sacred vow never to reveal anything concerning our students. We would die first."<p>"You know my secret?" Ranma almost screamed, looking at Sensei Chan with horrified eyes.<p>"Yes," was her reply. "We've known it for some time now. I, for one, fail to see what the problem is about it. Given the proper guidance, you could make good use of it."<p>"How?" Ranma muttered dejectedly.<p>"Trust me," Sensei Chan laughed. "There are several ways. First off, you could use it while practicing."<p>"Huh?" Ranma queried.<p>"Your major weakness in this area is that you can be defeated in female form by those you can normally de-feat," replied Sensei Chan in a firm, yet gentle voice. "If you practice at least half of the time while in this form, you will not only learn how to take advantage of its attributes, but you will also increase your skill level to that of your normal form, thus negating any advantage your opponents have over you. Just imagine what it would also do to your skill level as a boy!"<p>Ranma mulled that over for a while.<p>"There's something that I should tell you before we reach the school grounds," Sensei Chan said. "The branch of the school we are going to was basically designed for girls, there being more of them as martial artists in this area. There will only be four or five boys in the whole school."<p>"How many girls?" Ranma asked.<p>"Around a hundred or so," was the calm reply.<p>Ranma turned his head and stared in amazement at his new mentor.<p>"Not to worry," the woman laughed. "We have separate accommodations for all our students. All our branches were originally designed to be co-ed in flavor. You will have all the privacy you require."<p>"One other thing," Sensei Chan added. "This being the summer, you will probably be the only boy in the dormitory. The others have gone on vacation. Even if they were at the school, they normally only use the dormitory when they have a lot of schoolwork to do.<p>"Think about it! You will be the only boy in an otherwise all girls school! The others will literally be fighting over you!"<p>"Terrific!" muttered Ranma. "That's just what I need!" There was a bit of cynicism in his voice.<p>"Do I detect some trepidation?" Sensei Chan asked.<p>"You do," was Ranma's reply.<p>Sensei Chan laughed again. "There is really nothing to worry about. I'm sure all of you will get along splendidly."<p>The two travelers continued down the road.<p>-<p>At the edge of town was a large, walled enclosure. There was a large, ornate gate situated along the south wall. The two travelers walked up to the gate. Sensei Chan took her staff and pounded on the gate three times. After a few minutes, the large gate split down the middle and swung open.<p>"Welcome to the Great School of Martial Abilities," Sensei Chan said to Ranma. "Let me introduce you to the staff and other students, then we will settle you in."<p>There were at least a dozen other teachers, only two of whom were men. They all bowed at Ranma, who respectfully bowed back.<p>"Was there any trouble?" one of the older women asked. She appeared to be the leader of the group. "Initially," Sensei Chan replied. "They accepted trial by combat, however."<p>"As expected," the elderly woman said. "And the one called Happosai?"<p>"Defeated almost immediately. Are you sure he is a force to be reckoned with?"<p>"Only to the innocent and untrained," was the reply. "His perversions are a great weakness to his otherwise great abilities. He is a blight on the otherwise good name of our noble profession."<p>"You know him?" Ranma asked incredulously.<p>"We've heard of him," the old woman replied. "I, personally, have had the misfortune to meet up with him. How he became a teacher is beyond me."<p>"That makes two of us," Ranma said.<p>The other teachers laughed at the statement.<p>Ranma was then introduced to the girls attending the summer classes. There were exactly one hundred and twenty of them. Their initial greeting was quite enthusiastic, as they surrounded the poor boy before he could say a word. They practically mobbed Ranma.<p>At that moment, Sensei Chan clapped her hands twice, saying "Girls, girls, give the poor boy some room." The girls immediately backed away from Ranma and reformed into three lines.<p>"This is Ranma Saotome," Sensei Chan told them. "He will be studying with us for the next two months. He is highly skilled and has won several competitions over the past year."<p>Ranma modestly bowed his head and looked away from the assembled girls.<p>"Ranma is here to eliminate some weaknesses and improve upon his skills even more. I am sure you will also find him a great tutor or sparring partner."<p>All the girls bowed respectfully towards Ranma, who returned the bow, then went about their business. "Please excuse their boisterousness," Sensei Chan said. "As the only boy here, you will the center of attention for a while. Rest assured, however, that things will quiet down rather quickly. You won't be bothered again."<p>Sensei Chan then showed Ranma to his room. "Please forgive the accommodations," she said. "Simplicity has always been our watchword."<p>"I've seen worse," Ranma replied.<p>"You are too kind," said Sensei Chan. "You can put your things away and rest a while from your journey. We will have our first lesson after dinner."<p>She bowed and left the room.<p>Ranma hung his clothes in the closet next to his bed, and placed his tunics, pants, and underwear in the drawers of a simple dresser at the wall opposite the bed. The bed itself was a simple affair, being a straw filled mattress on top of a wooden frame. There was a head to the bed and a pillow. A blanket completed the ensemble.<p>A small nightstand was next to the head of the bed. On it was a candleholder with candle. A box of matches lay next to it.<p>Ranma lay on top of the mattress and stared at the ceiling. The mattress was unusually comfortable for such a simple affair. Ranma could feel himself falling asleep already. He therefore set his alarm clock, so he would not miss out on dinner. He then fell into a deep, refreshing sleep.<p>-<p>It was an hour after dinner. Ranma found himself in a room that was barren, with the exception of a table and two chairs. Sensei Chan sat on the chair in front of the wall. Ranma took the chair opposite her.<p>"I trust you rested well," Sensei Chan said.<p>Ranma nodded in the affirmative.<p>"Good," Sensei Chan replied. "We will then get on with the lesson."<p>"What will we be doing?" Ranma asked.<p>"Reflexes, their speed and timing."<p>Ranma wondered how sitting at a table would test his reflexes, when he suddenly felt a gust of air at his left cheek. He rolled his eyes in that direction, and started to sweat as he saw Sensei Chan's palm just millimeters away from his cheek.<p>"That has got to be the slowest reaction I have seen yet!" Sensei Chan laughed. "And to think I told those girls how good you were."<p>Ranma couldn't understand what was going on.<p>"You will have to do better than that if you are to excel in this school," Sensei Chan said. "If I had not stopped my blow, you would have been on the floor. Let's try again."<p>Again? Ranma was starting to get worried. It looked like Akane may have been right about all of this. He felt the rush of air and immediately flung his head back.<p>"Better," said Sensei Chan. "Now let's see if you can block it."<p>Again, she raised her hand in order to slap Ranma and let fly. Ranma instantly threw up his left forearm, blocking the blow.<p>"Excellent," Sensei Chan exclaimed. "We are definitely making progress."<p>"Just what are we doing?" Ranma asked in an incredulous tone.<p>"We are in the process of eliminating the first of three weaknesses that you have," replied Sensei Chan cheerfully. These three weaknesses are girls, cats, and lack of certain skills. It seemed appropriate that we start with the girls, it being so late in the day and all."<p>"What weakness do I have concerning girls?" Ranma asked.<p>"Your inability to fight them," was Sensei Chan's calm reply.<p>Ranma was more confused than ever now. "How is it weak to not fight girls?" he asked.<p>"It leaves you vulnerable to attack," was the reply.<p>"There is something very important that I must convey to you," Sensei Chan continued.<p>"What is that?" Ranma asked.<p>"Don't trust women!"<p>Ranma stared in disbelief at Sensei Chan. Here was a woman telling him not to trust women! That made no sense at all.<p>Sensei Chan saw his emotion. "I will explain," she said.<p>"Long ago, when men thought themselves dominate over all, women, lacking the fighting skills we have today, had to use their charms and their wiles in order to survive. This was especially true when around vicious brutes and sex fiends.<p>"As time passed, and humanity became more civilized, women's burdens began to ease, although slowly. We still had to rely on our wiles. The new rules of conduct between the sexes made this much easier. A woman could get a man to do whatever she wanted with just a flutter of the eyelashes, some tears, or by playing up to his ego.<p>"This worked quite well with the macho types and those trained to believe that women were the 'weaker sex'. These skills have served us well over the millennia up to present times.<p>"You, however, are different. Despite your outmoded education in the facts of life, you are very respectful of the female sex. This is a trait that we have been promoting in each generation of men over the last several centuries.<p>"Unfortunately, there are several women who now take unfair advantage of this. This is why you are constantly being beaten upon by the girls. They take advantage of your reluctance to fight back. We are going to correct this.<p>"Your basic problem is that you are too free with your trust. That is one of the reasons you have so much trouble.<p>"Other people, even women, must earn your respect. It is the only way you can be sure that they are trust-worthy. Until then, you must be willing to do whatever it takes to protect yourself from those who would abuse your trust.<p>"That is where we come in. We will teach you how to fight girls. If you can fight them, you can fight anything."<p>Ranma looked uncertain. "I don't know if I want to do such a thing. I really don't want to hurt anybody." Sensei Chan smiled. "I had hoped you would say something like that. Now we can begin training in earnest."<p>"I don't understand."<p>"You don't have to hurt them. However, you don't have to let them hurt you, either. We will teach you ways to defend yourself that will negate their advantage. Now, back to the practice at hand."<p>Again, Sensei Chan let loose with a slap that Ranma easily blocked.<p>"Very good," she said. "We will work on this until you will be able to block any blow, no matter how unexpected. Now, let us see you dodge again."<p>-<p>Ranma lay in bed, mulling over the evening's lessons. Sensei Chan had informed him that he would always have to be on his guard over the next several weeks, as at any time he could be attacked. This was to get him used to blocking any blow at a moment's notice. He wondered why such exercises were necessary, but decided to trust Sensei Chan on this.<p>Ranma wondered how the others were doing at home and why Akane had refused to come along. Surely, she would want to increase her knowledge in the martial arts. He also couldn't figure out why she distrusted Sensei Chan so. Sensei Chan had been very supportive of Ranma and was quick to praise his achievements. How opposite his father's methods this had been. Ranma believed that nothing was impossible with Sensei Chan for a teacher.<p>Ranma lay back on the pillow and closed his eyes. He had a whole two months to look forward to and didn't want to miss a minute of it. Ranma fell asleep, dreaming of all the things he could learn. As he slumbered, a shadowy figure looked in on him from the door, glided in, and gently pulled the blanket over him. It then left the room, leaving Ranma to his dreams.<p>To be continued...<p>Next Time: Ranma begins his first full day of school and Akane discovers that school's location.
