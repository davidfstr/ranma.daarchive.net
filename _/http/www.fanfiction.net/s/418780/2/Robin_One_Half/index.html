</div>Robin ½<p>-<p>By Felix Webster (Felix Warstar)<p>-<p>Chapter 2<p>First Day<p>-<p>All original Ranma 1/2 Characters and Back story Copyright Rumiko Takahashi, and all original DC Characters and Back story Copyright DC Comics Inc., and both are used without permission. Please don't sue... cause I have no money.<p>Any new characters are mine, but they can travel as their bags are always packed.<p>-<p>Version 1.1 (after one pre-reader gave me their edits)<p>-<p>Ranma woke as soon as someone came into the room he had been given. More than six months with those crazy warrior women had made him develop several skills to save him from an unplanned marriage. Cracking his eyes open just enough to look around he noticed Alfred setting out clothes from the dresser.<p>"You don't need to do that," Ranma complained with a yawn as he sat up.<p>"Did you sleep well, Master Ranma?" Alfred asked without turning around.<p>Ranma was about to complain about the 'Master' title again but decided it was way too early in the morning for that.<p>"Not really. I thought the beds in the village were soft, but this thing is way too soft. And the size of it! I could fit all the girls who were chasing me into it at one time. . . Not that I ever plan to do that!" He stated with a shudder remembering those crazy warrior women for the second time this morning.<p>"Oh yes, I seem to remember a large group of people seeing you off when we left," Alfred replied as he looked up from his examination of one of Ranma's favorite shirts. "Most of the girls looked very unhappy about it."<p>"And most of the guys were more than happy."<p>"I believe I remember a few of those in reverse too," Alfred gave Ranma a small smile.<p>Ranma shuddered again at the thought, "Lets not talk about that, Okay."<p>"As you wish, Master Ranma."<p>"Is Wayne-sama up yet?" Ranma asked as he rolled out of bed and started to dress in the offered clothing.<p>"He hasn't been to sleep yet. I believe he's winding down in the gym."<p>"Um, thanks," Ranma replied as he quickly ran out of the room.<p>Alfred watched the boy leave and shook his head with a smile, "Master Bruce you have no idea what you're dealing with this time."<p>-<p>Bruce was sitting on a workout bench with his shirt off rubbing out the strain when Ranma walked in to the room. Looking over the older man Ranma wasn't happy about what he saw.<p>"Good Morning," Bruce said in a very tired voice.<p>"Not for you so I see," Ranma replied as he continued to carefully study his new guardian. He mentally thanked Elder Tonic for teaching him to concentrate better as it had helped him many times since. He still wasn't very great at studying all the small clues that were always there but he would be. What he saw looking at Bruce almost made him wince in pity. "So what caused all that damage?"<p>Bruce straightened up hiding the pain, "What damage?"<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes slightly, "The two bruised ribs, the dislocated shoulder, the numerous other ones that will show up as bruises in a short time."<p>"Good eye," Bruce looked somewhat impressed at the boy's diagnosis. "I got mugged."<p>Ranma leaned against the wall by the door and gave an evil looking smile, "By what? A bear? You're a practioner of Anything Goes Martial Arts and are almost as good, if not better than me. No mugger would have a chance against you."<p>"How do you know what my skill level is? We've never even sparred yet," Bruce asked both curious about the answer and trying to distract the conversation.<p>"The same way you know mine, by the way you move and carry yourself," Ranma replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "You try way too hard to hide how good you are and that tells me a lot about what your true level of skill actually is."<p>"So there is a mind in that body after all," Bruce chuckled. "The girls may not like that."<p>"Whatever. I got too many things to deal with to bother with some crazy girls right now," Ranma stated annoyed. "First is to find out what you are hiding from me. I know it's none of my business but when Pop came back looking like that it usually meant we had problems coming soon."<p>"Don't worry, these things never follow me home," Bruce rotated his shoulder to keep it from going stiff.<p>"Stay here, I've got a salve that'll help with those bruises," Ranma said as he disappeared out the door. He was back in moments with an earthen jar with a cloth used as a drum seal.<p>Bruce didn't bother to say anything as Ranma applied the sweet smelling ointment. After about ten minutes he felt much better.<p>"That's pretty useful stuff, much stronger than what I usually have made up. . . And better smelling."<p>"The amazons use this stuff and they are women after all," Ranma relied as he resealed the jar and tap tested the seal.<p>"So, what was it? A fight club? Some underground martial tournament? Street fighting?" Ranma asked as he looked sternly at Bruce.<p>Bruce just shook his head smiling to himself, "Would you believe I ran into a human crocodile?"<p>"I change into a girl with cold water, Pop turned into a Panda," Ranma answered flatly.<p>"Point taken," Bruce chuckled again then yawned. "I'll tell you about it after I get some sleep."<p>"I'll hold you to that. A human crocodile that attacks people needs to be dealt with before it truly hurts someone," Ranma stated very firmly.<p>"You're right about that," Bruce mumbled to himself then smiled at the boy. "You're going to have a busy day. Dick's coming in from New York sooner than expected. He's close to your age so I figured he could help you with getting some clothes for school."<p>"I've got lots of clothes already," Ranma replied confused.<p>"They're mostly Chinese silk, they'll stick out way too much at school."<p>"Being Japanese in an American school isn't gonna stick out?" Ranma asked sarcastically.<p>"There are a lot of Japanese people in Gotham. I'll have Dick show you Little Tokyo while you're out," Bruce smiled again after wincing from stretching his shoulder to far. "And the school has a large number of Asians so you won't really stick out as long as you don't wear the silks."<p>"But the silks can be readjusted easier when I change sexes," Ranma complained.<p>"Alfred mentioned the bracelet you're wearing being able to shift clothes when you change," Bruce countered not liking magic in his home but seeing no real complaint about this one piece. "Oh, and you'll have to also shop for girls clothes that fit too."<p>"You don't expect me to wear dresses do you?" Ranma cringed.<p>"I don't see a reason right now, but if we have to go to any formal events you might need some in case of accidents."<p>"Great. . ." Ranma muttered under his breathe.<p>-<p>Dick arrived at the mansion just before noon, trying to make it look like he had just gotten in from out of town. He moved into the hall from the garage and immediately headed for the kitchen to find Alfred. On his way he passed the gym, hearing sounds from the room he stopped to investigate. Peeking in he was shocked by the sheer sight of the room's single occupant. A person, little younger than himself, was richeoting around the room leaping from wall to work out equipment to wall, all the while doing martial strikes and never touching the floor. Before he could say anything to announce his presence a red blur landed in front of him.<p>"Dick?" Asked the short red haired girl with a smile and a very large chest for her apparent age.<p>"Wha..  me!" Dick stuttered in shock not knowing if it was a question or a demand.<p>"Are you Dick, Wayne-sama's other ward?" Ranma-chan losing the higher point to her smile.<p>"Um, yeah. You must be Ranma," Dick replied cursing his own dirty mind.<p>"No, I'm the twisted cursed image of what Ranma would look like if he had been born a girl," Ranma-chan stated sarcastically. "Pleased ta meet ya."<p>"Bruce mentioned the curse," Dick replied lamely as Ranma-chan picked up a thermos from beside the door. Dick stood there stunned as he watched the change before his eyes. "Wow."<p>"Yeah, big wow. Having your height, weight, and sexual organs suddenly twisted at the touch of water is great fun."<p>"Look, I know things like this are tough. I've got a few friends with similar problems, but the attitude is going to get you into trouble," Dick state in annoyance.<p>Ranma stopped for a moment and looked ashamed of himself, "Sorry, I'm usually not like this. . . It's just, I don't know. I think Wayne-sama is getting into the troubles just like my father used to and I'm just not ready for those kind problems again."<p>"Don't worry about Bruce, he just needs a good backup he can rely on and things will be just fine," Dick smiled. "What I'd like to know is how a Japanese girl has red hair. . . Is it natural?"<p>"Yes, and I'm not gonna ta prove it so don't bother asking," Ranma replied as he toweled off his damp hair. "My mother has reddish hair, and Elder Tonic figures it's due to Chinese Amazon heritage somewhere in my family's past."<p>"Elder Tonic? Chinese Amazons?" Dick asked confused.<p>"Tonic is the Elder I stayed with while I was at her village, and the Chinese Amazons are a society of women warriors in the Qinghai province of China."<p>"Any relations to the Greek Amazons?"<p>"Never heard of them," Ranma replied as he walked past Dick to leave the gym. "You hungry?"<p>*I'll have to ask Donna about these 'Chinese' Amazons,* Dick thought to himself as he watched the boy leave the room. "Yeah, I was heading for the kitchen in the first place."<p>-<p>Dick watched in amazement as Ranma devoured the large lunch Alfred had prepared. There had been enough food to feed 10 or more people as far as he was concerned, and Ranma was already half way through it. It took a moment to realize that Ranma was leaving enough on each plate for him and Alfred to have full meals.<p>"Where do you put it all?"<p>Ranma looked up between bites and blinked in confusion, "I workout a lot and that needs lots of energy."<p>"I workout a lot and I don't need that much!" Dick replied in shock.<p>"Did Wayne-sama train you in the 'Anything Goes' style?" Ranma leaned back rubbing his stomach contently as he examined the older boy again. He was trained in something, that much was obvious, what in was exactly Ranma hadn't figured out yet.<p>"Anything Goes?" Dick looked confused.<p>"It's not it's proper name of the style but every time I try to say it in English that's what it comes out as," Ranma replied perplexed by the twist in the way some of his words came out sometimes. "And Bruce seemed to recognize the name so I guess that's what it's called here."<p>"Well, Bruce did train me to fight so I guess that's the style Bruce trained me in, but I had training when I was little in circus acrobatics. "<p>"Good, we can spar later then," Ranma smiled.<p>Dick thought about what he had seen earlier and winced slightly, "I don't know, you seem a little out of my league."<p>"Oh come on, you'll never really improve unless you challenge yourself against better opponents," Ranma almost pleaded. "And I'll go easy on you."<p>"I guess. . ." Dick agreed but he wasn't happy about it.<p>"It'll have to wait until after your shopping trip, Master Ranma," Alfred stated as he hid a smile behind his proper British expressions. "And remember it's for clothes in both your forms."<p>Ranma grimaced, "I wish I could forget."<p>"Well I can be a help with the guy clothes, but I'm at a loss when it comes to anything else," Dick commented with a shrug. "I could call a friend who could help out, if I can convince her to come out for a while."<p>-<p>"I got here as soon as I could, what's happening that required me coming in person? You know I don't like leaving home, Barbara asked with a frown as she wheeled herself in the front door.<p>"I need you to help Ranma pick out some good clothes," Dick smiled as he moved out of the way to introduce the boy to her. "Ranma Saotome, this is Barbara Gordon. She's a good friend of both me and Bruce."<p>Barbara looked up confused and annoyed, "Dick I don't see why you needed my help, you do a pretty good job at choosing men's fashion yourself."<p>"Ranma, show her."<p>"Okay, but I'm still against this," Ranma complained as he dumped the contents of the glass he held over his, now her head. Standing in the same spot was now a shorter red haired Asian girl that shimmered slightly around the clothes until they settled on a slightly different cut version of what she had been wearing as a boy.<p>"What the. . .!" Barbara looked between the new girl and her old friend then the girl again in shock and confusion. "Did I. . .?"<p>"It's a magical curse I got in China," Ranma-chan explained depressed. She knew she'd be explaining this over and over again as time went on, but couldn't she just have a normal life.<p>"Bruce was right, I wouldn't believe this unless I saw it," Barbara stated wide-eyed then controlled her reaction and wheeled herself over to the girl. "Magical curses are the worse aren't they? So which are you normally?"<p>"I'm a guy!" Ranma-chan nearly shouted then looked away sadly. "Great, a few days away from the village and already I'm falling back into old patterns."<p>"So Dick, this is why you need my help? I take it she doesn't know much about female clothes?"<p>"Actually I know a lot about female requirements and makeup," Ranma-chan added embarrassed. "But it's from outdated Chinese Amazon ideals so I just don't know a lot about western styles."<p>"Chinese Amazons?" Barbara looked confused again.<p>"I was going to ask you about them later," Dick replied. "Ranma seems to have some of their heritage in her."<p>"I've never heard of them, but I can ask around later." Barbara looked back at the frowning girl and smiled, "Lets go get you some clothes."<p>-<p>Shopping for his male side was easier then expected. He knew what would fit him and how it would look very quickly and that sped that up. Also the fact that he had to schedule tailoring appointments for all the formal clothes that Alfred seemed to think he would need.<p>Then it was his girl side's turn.<p>Barbara took her into shop after shop, and Ranma-chan had to try on every little outfit that the older girl picked out. They got into small arguments every time Barbara picked a skirt or dress for the red-head, but for the most part Ranma-chan seemed to start enjoying herself. Roughly twelve bags later Ranma-chan looked embarrassed at the sheer mass of it all, and the fact Barbara had convinced her to wear a little top and caprice pant set with her original soft shoes. The light makeup was annoying but she had to admit that it did look nice on her.<p>"So you use to do martial art too?" Ranma-chan asked Barbara as the three of them stopped for snacks.<p>"What? How did you know?" Barbara replied in shock. "I mean it's kind of hard to tell because of the wheelchair."<p>"Nah, you still carry yourself like a martial artist even with the chair," Ranma-chan smiled as she bit into the soft burrito Dick had gotten her.<p>"Well, I was training with Bruce and Dick for a while before the accident," Barbara answered looking a little unhappy by the topic.<p>"Why'd you stop?"<p>Barbara looked at the girl confused. Why'd she stop? It was painfully obvious why she had stopped! She calmed herself before she continued so she didn't say something very nasty, "I can't move my legs at all, and that kind of put a dampener on continuing any martial arts."<p>"You could learn several moves which were designed for when a person gets their legs entangled. Or learn pressure points as they can be very useful for protection," Ranma-chan replied as she finished her snack.<p>"Ranma, Barbara is still a little touchy about the accident since it happened only a little while ago," Dick stated firmly hoping the girl got the hint.<p>"Oh. .Ah. .sorry," Ranma-chan hung her head in shame.<p>"Don't worry about it, I really don't mind anymore. . .now that I have something to take my mind off things," Barbara smiled back.<p>"Hey, we should get back to shoppi. . ." Dick started but a small explosion and a great billowing gray gas cloud coming from the mall's bank stall stopped him.<p>Dick looked at Barbara with a very familiar look and was given a small waving off and a simple, "Go for it. I'm out of the business but I know you want to."<p>Dick gave a lopsided grin as he got up to excuse himself, it was then they both noticed that Ranma-chan wasn't at the table anymore. Looking towards the bank he saw a red streak running into the gas cloud. Running for a secluded spot Dick started changing as quickly as possible hoping that the girl didn't get herself hurt.<p>-<p>The Black Rose was proud of herself, the sleeping gas may have dispersed too soon with ventilation but it had gotten everyone in the room. She'd have to remember to thank her friend in Japan for the recipe, and of course for the costume idea. Posing for the benefit of henchgirls she tried to make her skimpy gymnastic styled black spandex outfit hug her body even more than the material was designed for.<p>"Oh ho ho ho ho ho! Okay girls go to it," She called out from behind the hand she put daintily in front of her mouth not actually touching her black mask. "And remember to check the bills before you take them."<p>"YES BOSS!" Cried out the six girls, each wearing less revealing blue leotards and domino masks. They ran into the teller area and started looting.<p>-<p>Ranma-chan had jumped up and ran towards the explosion out of reflex. It took a moment for her active mind to catch up to her but when it did she realized that the smoke cloud could be dangerous. Taking a moment to shift her clothes to one of her Chinese pantsuits she ripped off a strip of silk. She then shifted into the female version of her favorite outfit and tied the strip over her mouth and nose before continuing into the gas.<p>Running into the bank she stopped at the sight of the girl in the black spandex outfit. It was an effort to will her nose from exploding in blood when she realize that the leotard was transparent with only oblique areas just barely covering the girl's private parts. Even She had more decency than THAT!<p>Recovering quickly Ranma-chan decided that confidant was the way to deal with this. Leaning against the doorframe of the entrance she crossed her arms and put lopsided smile on her face, "I really don't think you're suppose to bank like that."<p>The Black Rose spun towards the unexpected voice to find a young girl, possibly younger than herself, wearing fairly nice Chinese silk clothes in red and black and a red silk mask. Giving the girl her best arrogant smile she went into instant pose, twirling a ribbon on a stick in front of her, "I bank anyway I wish to, Oh ho ho hohoho!"<p>Ranma-chan cringed at the obvious insanity in that laugh but held her composure, "Then I guess I have to stop you."<p>"You can try!" The Black Rose cried loudly as she threw a small object directly at her opponent.<p>Ranma-chan snatched the object with ease even though it was thrown with enough force to break bones. Looking at her catch she was confused at seeing a small club of some kind she didn't recognized. Her attention turned away from the dark girl allowed the Black Rose a chance to hit the Redhead with the snap of a whip like weapon.<p>Realizing her mistake Ranma-chan grabbed the new weapon on its second swing, "A ribbon!"<p>"No one has ever stopped my ribbon before," the Black Rose said in annoyance only to have the handle yanked from her hand. "Hey give that back!"<p>Reaching behind her back she pulled out a blue ball, which she whipped towards a far wall.<p>"It's just a regular ribbon! Then how did it cut my shirt?" Ranma-chan asked in confusion as she moved out the ball's richoetting path only to be hit in the back by another bounce. The ball exploded upon impact throwing her across the room.<p>"Ow," Ranma-chan stood up shaking slightly and had to start dodging several strikes from another ribbon.<p>Ranma-chan was finally getting the pattern of strikes when the Black Rose noticed another costumed individual heading towards the bank. The smoke no longer concealing her activities the way she wanted, and things were just getting too hot, she decided to take her leave. Grabbing another ball she threw it in front of herself causing a large area of smoke to appear, "I'll deal with you another time girl, Oh ho ho hohoho. . ."<p>As Nightwing reached the bank the smoke had dispersed enough to reveal the Black Rose gone and in her place a bouquet of black roses. Looking for Ranma-chan found her tying up the other girls with the stolen ribbon. None of the girls looked happy about the capture but they didn't resist with much effort.<p>"I guess I'm late," Nightwing stated with a weak smile and a hand behind his head. He walked over to where Ranma-chan put the girls.<p>"She got away," Ranma-chan replied very annoyed as she finished up with the girls.<p>"Don't worry, she didn't get anything this time so she'll try again. Her type always does. You'll get her next time."<p>"Yeah, sure," Ranma-chan didn't sound convinced. Her natural state of confidence had long been shattered when she realized nothing she could do would save her Pop, this had been just another annoying addition to her list of failures.<p>"Hey, getting all the henchme. . henchgirls and stopping the villain from getting what they wanted is a good start for a new crime fighter in Gotham," Nightwing smiled bolder this time as he patted the girl on the shoulder and led her out of the bank. Sirens could be heard in the distance.<p>Ranma-chan looked up at the older boy beside her and lifted an eyebrow, "What's with the weird outfit Dick?"<p>-<p>"He knew it was you right away?" Batman asked as he positioned himself into a good watching position on the warehouse roof. They were watching through a skylight waiting for a tip to pay off.<p>"She said I moved the same and something about Ki auras, but yes she pick it out like that," Nightwing replied as he snapped his fingers. He set up the recording device and tested the volume.<p>"And?"<p>"And what?" Nightwing looked confused as he moved back into his own position.<p>"What did you tell HIM?," Batman asked again stressing the word 'him'.<p>"I told her. . . I mean him that I'd discuss it with him tomorrow. I wanted a chance to talk to you first."<p>Batman looked up at his partner and cocked and eyebrow, "And he let it go at that?"<p>"He said he'd have to hurt me if I didn't live up to my promise," Nightwing replied with a smile. "Personally after what I saw him do in the gym I think he could."<p>"He has the skills but not the experience. If it came down to it I'd say you'd win but only by out thinking him," Batman stated thinning out his lips. "Give him about a year and then you won't have a hope in hell."<p>"So you are going to make him Robin?" Nightwing cocked his own eyebrow at his mentor.<p>"Show him the batcave tomorrow when you explain about the Nightwing costume."<p>"Right," Nightwing gave Batman a big smile. The man needed a proper partner, he was getting too intense before Nightwing decided to come back and try to keep him in check. But Nightwing had other responsibilities to deal with and couldn't stick around forever.<p>"Hold on, getting something on the mike," Nightwing said interrupting his own thoughts.<p>"Is it Cobblepot?"<p>"Sounds like him, but I thought he was supposed to be going straight," Nightwing looked confused.<p>"Midnight meetings, sudden appearances of people like Killer Croc, you tell me," Batman countered. "We need to handle this carefully since he's seems to have a connection to the mayor's office right now."<p>"Proper proof instead of vigilanty justice?"<p>"Sounds about right," Batman replied as he settled himself and started to listen to the meeting below him.<p>-<p>Authors Notes:<p>I couldn't bring myself to import all the original characters to the Gotham area. . . so there will be some faux variants to fill the void.<p>And as you can guess I have a story leading up involving the Penguin, it'll come fully into light in a couple more chapters. Have to have the Bat doing something with his time.
