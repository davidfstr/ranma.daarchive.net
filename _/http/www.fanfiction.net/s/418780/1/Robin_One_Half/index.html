Please don't sue...<br/>cause I have no money.<br/>Any new characters are mine, but they can travel as their bags are<br/>always packed.<p>Welcome to Gotham<p>It was a bleak night, even for Gotham, but as far as Bruce Wayne was<br/>concrened it matched his mood. The rain was cutting through the heavy<br/>coat he wrapped around himself and the wind made standing on the roof<br/>of Wayne-Tech Towers a true danger. He stood his ground and put his<br/>face to the skies in defiance, it had only been six months since the<br/>loss of his last ward, Jason Todd, and the time hadn't healled the<br/>emotional wounds. He wasn't ready for this yet again.<p>Bruce gave himself a mental shove, this was a matter of honour, a debt<br/>owed, not something he could have refused. The thought of taking on<br/>another ward so soon, it just didn't settle right with him. And the<br/>boy. . . He had just lost a loved one, a parent, even if Bruce could<br/>understand the feelings the boy probably wasn't ready either.<p>Taking a moment to return to himself Bruce looked off in the direction<br/>he knew the helicopter would be coming in from and tried to bring back<br/>the false persona that people were supposed to see.<p>Ranma watched as the city come into view, it was large, dark, and<br/>lonely looking. He had never seen a city so obviously designed to be<br/>omminous before, and he kind of wished he wasn't doing so now. The<br/>flight in from the landing field was only the second time he had ever<br/>flew, the first was the private jet which had come for him in China,<br/>and it was a thrill to be so high above the ground. Unfortunely the<br/>city took most of that thrill away bringing back bad memories, like why<br/>he was coming to live with a gajin stranger in a city on the other side<br/>of the world he had known all his life.<p>Glancing over at the man who called himself simply 'Alfred', Ranma<br/>wondered again why an strong minded, an honourable man like him could<br/>allow himself to be a servant to others. It might have been a weird<br/>thought for a person raised in japan, with japan's history and all, but<br/>to Ranma it was an important one. He needed to know what made people do<br/>what they did, and why, it was how he was using now to try not thinking<br/>about his father's death.<p>"So, um, Alfred, where are we gonna land?" Ranma asked as he scanned<br/>the city again, he decided the rain just added to the nastiness of the<br/>image. His only real examples of cities were Tokyo and Hong Kong, the<br/>first because his father kept coming back to there when they weren't<br/>traveling around, and the second from only a few days ago where he and<br/>Alfred and left on this trip. Tokyo was to bright and atempted to look<br/>civilized, and Hong Kong. . . Well Hong Kong had much the same feel as<br/>Gotham, execpt it looked like they tried to put a little hope in their<br/>building designs.<p>Alfred leaned over and pointed at the tallest building which stuck out<br/>of the ground like a canine tooth among mollars, "That is the Wayne-<br/>Tech headquarters. Master Bruce is up there waiting for you."<p>"It's nice of him to take me in and all, " Ranma said politely but<br/>with the same sadness he had carried since China. "He wouldn't have had<br/>to if I could have found either my Mother or father's old friend Mr.<br/>Tendo."<p>"Don't worry yourself, you aren't the first ward Master Bruce has<br/>welcomed into his home," Alfred replied as he put a comforting hand on<br/>the boy's shoulder, he had taken a liking to Ranma quickly seeing a<br/>strong dedication to all things the boy set his mind to. "You'll meet<br/>Master Richard in a couple of days since he's currently at university<br/>in New York."<p>Alfred's only concern was how his employer would take Ranma's other<br/>problem. . .<p>-<p>Bruce watched the helicopter finish it's landing and the unloading of<br/>gear with a bit of hesitation, although by the time the doors opened he<br/>had hid his real feelings again.<p>Ranma stepped out of the helicopter glad for the heavy rain coat he<br/>was wearing as the rain on seemed to intensify as the doors opened. And<br/>the umbrella Alfred was holding over him really helped too. Alfred led<br/>Ranma towards whom he could only assume was Mr. Wayne, he had the look<br/>of a man in the kind of pain Ranma was feeling himself and that<br/>bothered Ranma for some reason he couldn't figure out. Ranma was about<br/>to bow in greeting when the wind caught the umbrella at a bad angle to<br/>be carried away into the dark sky.<p>Bruce watched in shock as the teenage boy with black hair, who had<br/>originally been standing in front of him with his friend, shift into a<br/>slightly smaller teenage girl with natural fire red hair. At least her<br/>clothes still seemed to fit.<p>"You. . ." was about all his mind would allow him at the moment. He<br/>had seen stranger things before but this was just too unexpected, and<br/>caught him off guard.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, sorry about this," Ranma-chan answered avoiding<br/>looking directing at the man in front of her, depression obvious in her<br/>voice.<p>Bruce looked squarely into Alfred's eyes with a cocked eyebrow, "Did I<br/>just see. . .?"<p>"Yes, Master Bruce, Ranma, the boy I've brought back from China, has<br/>just turned into a girl."<p>"Is it some kind of Meta power?" turning his attention back to the<br/>depressed boy. . . girl.<p>"It's a curse," Ranma-chan stated coldly not bothering to look up.<p>"A curse? . . . I see. Well, we'd best get out of this rain before<br/>discusing this further," Bruce replied as he directed the girl towards<br/>the nearest door. "it sounds like it going to be a long story."<p>After drying themselves off, Alfred led them to the car so Ranma could<br/>see his new home and get settled in. At first Bruce was strangely<br/>quiet, giving his new ward glances from time to time.<p>"Yes, the curse changes me completely into a girl, at least<br/>physically," Ranma-chan stated in annoyed tone after finally getting<br/>feed up with the stares.<p>"That wasn't what I was wondering. . . At least not yet, I'm just<br/>having problems with the idea of seeing a real 'curse'," Bruce replied<br/>trying to sound friendlier then he did earlier.<p>"Sorry. . . And sorry for the intrusion into your life Wayne-sama,"<br/>Ranma-chan started as she looked up again. "Alfred explained what<br/>happened with your last ward, I understand it wasn't your fault. . .<br/>But I understand why you feel guilty."<p>"It was my fault he was were he was," Bruce stated with a touch of<br/>anger.<p>"If I'm gonna be too much trouble. . . I can always go back to Japan."<p>"I don't mean to seem unfriendly, Ranma, I've just not been sleeping<br/>too well for the past couple of months," Bruce explained, rubbing his<br/>eyes with the back of his hand. "If I wasn't willing to take you in I<br/>wouldn't have, so don't concern yourself about that."<p>"Just forgive me for what I'm going to do," Bruce thought to himself<br/>unhappy about what he had set in motion.<p>"Pop said you were a student of his when I was just a baby, I don't<br/>really remember you."<p>"I started my training a little before your mother got pregnant and I<br/>stayed for a couple years after you were born, that's how I became your<br/>Godfather," Bruce explained thinking back to his time in Japan. "I owe<br/>a lot to your father. . . And it's the least I could do for such an<br/>honourable man."<p>Ranma-chan's eyes bugged out and a small spurt of laughter couldn't be<br/>held back, "My Pop. . . Honourable! On which planet was this?"<p>"He was one of the most honourable men I have ever known," Bruce<br/>replied looking confused by the girl's reaction.<p>Ranma-chan started laughing, hard. Each time she tried to stop it<br/>would start again causing her to soon double over in pain, "My. . . Pop<br/>. . . Was. . . A. . . Thief and. . . A bastard! He use to sell me of<br/>for food then steal me back after he ate and I'd been fed."<p>"I don't understand," Bruce said in confusion. Turning towards Alfred<br/>he asked, "Are you sure it was the same Genma Saotome?"<p>"Of course, Master Bruce," Alfred replied indigently.<p>"Pop may have talked big about honour and duty, but he never listened<br/>to himself."<p>"So. . . You were raised by a scoundrel?" Bruce asked in a serious<br/>tone wondering what had changed his old sensai, and if the girl. . .<br/>Boy followed in his example.<p>"Yeah, but I tried to be as opposite to him as I could be," Ranma-chan<br/>stated proudly.<p>"I see."<p>-<p>Things got quiet again for the rest of the trip until Ranma got her<br/>first view of the manson, and realized they were headed there.<p>"Is that. . .?"<p>"Wanyne Manor, the family home of the Wayne family for many<br/>generations," Alfred replied from the front of the Bently.<p>"And your new home," Bruce added trying to put on a big smile.<p>"It's. . . Huge."<p>Finally reaching their destination Alfred tried to take out the bags<br/>which held Ranma's meager belongings, but Ranma-chan grabbed her own<br/>backpack which Alfred was struggling with as if it was almost<br/>weightless.<p>"Don't worry about it I can carry my own stuff in," she said with a<br/>smile then headed off to follow Bruce into the large house.<p>Alfred just blinked as he watched the girl run off with a pack which<br/>had to weight a half ton, then shrugged before bringing the rest of the<br/>bags in.<p>-<p>"So has Alfred got you settled in?" Bruce asked as he watched a now<br/>male Ranma walk into the library he was sitting in.<p>"Ah, yeah. . . Big room," Ranma replied still feeling overwhelmed.<br/>"Big house."<p>"Bigger than you might think," Bruce said smilling at his own personal<br/>joke. "So can we talk about this curse?"<p>"Not much to say, cold water changes me into a girl and hot water<br/>changes me back," Ranma replied as he did a small leap into another<br/>chair.<p>"That doesn't say much," Bruce stated looking annoyed.<p>"There's this ancient training ground in China, Jusenkyo. Over a<br/>hundred little springs are spread out all over the place, each has had<br/>something drown in it at some time in the past. You fall in one and<br/>poof you're cursed to become what ever drowned there when cold water<br/>hits you," Ranma explained rolling his eyes. "I'm told I got off lucky,<br/>turning into a girl and all, Pop was cursed to become a Panda bear."<p>Bruce cocked an eybrow at the boy, "A panda?"<p>"Yeah, still kinda looked like Pop though."<p>"That was something I was going to mention. . . Your girl form looks a<br/>lot like you, and the red hair isn't too suprising as your Mother has<br/>redish hair herself," Bruce said thinking back to the days he spent at<br/>the Saotome Dojo.<p>"Tonic said the springs couldn't make us the exact image of the thing<br/>which drowned, it would cause too much confusion, so it makes a person<br/>what they would have looked like if they were born that way," Ranma<br/>explained. "So I look the way I would have if I was born a girl."<p>"Tonic?"<p>"An elder Chinese Amazon, she took me and Pop in while he looked for<br/>someone to look after me when he died."<p>"Chinese Amazons?" Bruce said in mild shock then waved off the<br/>explaination he saw coming. "No, no that's okay. Too much at once."<p>"The guide at the training grounds also said some of the springs bring<br/>mental changes too, fortunely spring of drowned girl doesn't," Ranma<br/>continued with a small shudder. "I don't know how I'd handle knowing<br/>that I acted like a girl while I was in my curse form."<p>"You have a real problem with turning into a girl?"<p>"You could say that," Ranma replied sarcasticly. "I was raised to be<br/>'A Man Among Men', Pop tried to teach me all things manly and to avoid<br/>anything which wasn't. It caused a lot of problems between us as I was<br/>growing up."<p>"I see. . ." Bruce replied rubbing his chin. "So you changing into a<br/>girl was like a slap in his face, making all his training useless?"<p>"Not really, but it did cause problems. He made a pact with my Mother<br/>promising that he'd make 'A Man Among Men' by the time he brought me<br/>home or we'd both commit seppeku."<p>Bruce's eyes went wide in shock, "I can't believe you went along with<br/>the deal. You seem more intelligent to me than that."<p>Ranma chuckled to himself while shaking his head, "Like a lot of what<br/>my Pop did with me I had no choice in the matter. I was a baby at the<br/>time the pact was made, he said he put my hand print on the page to<br/>make me agree to the pact."<p>"I see," Bruce replied sounding very unhappy about what he had been<br/>hearing. "I guess my old sensai had changed a lot after I left. . ."<p>"Oh, he said he was sorry about everything he did to me over the ten<br/>years we had been traveling, sorta to get it off his concious," Ranma<br/>stated with a sneer. "If it wasn't for how good a martial artist he<br/>made me I wouldn't have forgiven him any of it."<p>"Master Bruce, I've laid out your evening meal," Alfred called from<br/>the door.<p>Ranma looked at the antique clock over the fireplace in confusion then<br/>back at Bruce.<p>"I work late, I work late," Bruce replied as he got up and headed out<br/>of the library with Ranma following behind.<p>-<p>Bruce and Alfred looked on in shock as they watched Ranma decimate the<br/>food on his plate, it was his fifth helping and it looked like he was<br/>going to ask for. . .<p>"More, please," Ranma asked holding up his plate with a smile.<p>"I'm sorry, Master Ranma, if I'd known you where going to have such an<br/>apatite I would have made more," Alfred replied recovering himself.<p>Ranma wiped his mouth and smiled, "That's okay, Alfred, it should do<br/>until morning."<p>"I'm surprised that you're not having stomach problems after inhaling<br/>all that," Bruce stated from across the table still working on his<br/>first plate.<p>"Nah, I chew everything I have to," Ranma replied as he got up. "Me<br/>and Pop used to do that all the time, he made everything he could into<br/>training."<p>"And what kind of training was that, Master Ranma? Insulting the cook?"<p>"What? Oh no, that was delicious, not what I'm use to, but delicious,"<br/>Ranma said quickly bowing to the man. "It was speed training. Me and<br/>Pop tried steal food from each other and eat it before it could be<br/>stolen back or allowing any of our own to be stolen."<p>Bruce thought about it for minute as Ranma looked around the room, "I<br/>guess that would encourage a person to either get faster or starve, but<br/>the level of speed you displayed was beyond human."<p>"Nothing is beyond human, it just takes discipline and the right<br/>training," Ranma replied seriously without stopping his examination of<br/>the painting he was looking at.<p>"There are always limits to things, Ranma," Bruce said as he wiped his<br/>own mouth finally finished his meal.<p>Ranma laughed, "Thinking like that is why you've found limits." He<br/>turned around and smiled, "I know a couple of Chinese ladies, who are<br/>probably the oldest people I'll ever hear of, they are much more faster<br/>than I am, and they say all it took was training."<p>"Is this 'Tonic' you mentioned earlier one of them?"<p>"Yep," Ranma stated with a larger smile. "She really openned my eyes<br/>to a lot of the things that Pop thought were 'Unmanly'. And the<br/>training her and her sister gave me really improved my skills."<p>"I see," Bruce replied as he looked at his watch. He stood and started<br/>to head for the door, "I'm sorry, Ranma, we'll have to continue this<br/>tomorrow, I have an appointment tonight that I have to keep. Have a<br/>good night, and I'll see you in the morning."<p>"Um, okay," Ranma answered to the empty room, looking at a clock he<br/>wondered what kind of business was done after eleven at night.<br/>Shrugging his shoulders he headed to his room still tried for the<br/>flight.<p>-<p>"Was wondering when you'd get here," Nightwing stated from his perch<br/>on the edge of the building that served as their starting point tonight.<p>Batman gave his old partner a dirty look before taking up his own<br/>position, "Ranma was more interesting than I thought he might be."<p>"Really, What he do? Stop a bullet with his bare hands?" Nightwing<br/>asked sarcasticly.<p>"No, but I might not put it past him to do it," Batman replied as he<br/>got his batoculars out and aimed them at the warehouse they were<br/>watching. "He became a girl."<p>". . . So your old sensai's son was really a daughter?"<p>"No, I was living with them when he was born, so I know that Nodoka<br/>had a boy," Batman stated as he focused in on a truck unloading crates.<p>"So this isn't Ranma? Do you think it's some kind of a plant?"<br/>Nightwing asked as he also took note of the crates then panned over to<br/>the man guarding the open gate.<p>"No, Ranma turned back into a boy after we got to the mansion," Batman<br/>focused on a trio of men on the roof of the warehouse taking note of<br/>the lack of guns.<p>"Some kind of Meta power?" Nightwing spotted the short staves the men<br/>carried and pointed them out to his mentor.<p>"Magical curse, water activated, from China," Batman replied taking<br/>another device from his belt. Opening it he looked at the display<br/>looking for a little red dot to surface on the scanning surface.<p>"Holy Ancient Chinese Secrets, Batman," Nightwing stated with a big<br/>smile trying not to start laughing.<p>"I've missed you, Dick," Batman said with his forehead in his hand<br/>also trying not to laugh. Calming themselves down he continued while<br/>still watching for that red dot, "He might still be a Meta, he<br/>displayed a level of speed tonight at dinner which was beyond human."<p>"You mean a teenager inhaled his food faster than he could chew and<br/>asked to excused, heavens forbid 'That ain't human!" Nightwing replied<br/>in mock shock.<p>"He finished five helpings before I was even halfways through my own,<br/>and I had a hard time seeing his hands move as they were moving so<br/>fast."<p>"And what did he have to say about it?"<p>Batman looked up from their survellence and turned to his friend, "He<br/>said it was just training, but Alfred told me in the cave that he<br/>witnessed Ranma do a lot of things simular in China."<p>"Are you going to have him tested?"<p>"I think I should," Batman stated unhappily. "It won't change my<br/>position on him living with me, but it might change my plans. . ."<p>"You still don't trust Meta's," Nightwing said sadly shaking his head.<br/>"Some of your best friends are Meta's."<p>"Yes, and some of my worst enemies are Meta's too."<p>Beep. . . Beep. . .<p>"Looks like our friend is here," Batman stated looking down at the<br/>device as it changed from a little blinking dot to a video display of<br/>the inside of the warehouse. Turning a couple of dials the picture<br/>rotated until to rested apon the round, but sharp features of a small<br/>man in a tophat and fine tails.<p>"He's there," Batman stated as he grabbed the grapple from his belt.<br/>Both he and Nightwing swung off the building towards the warehouse to<br/>do their night job.<p>-<p>
