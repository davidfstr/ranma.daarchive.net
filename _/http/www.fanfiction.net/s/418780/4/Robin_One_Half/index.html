</div>A Ranma ½ Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Robin 1 / 2<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>By Felix Webster (Felix Warstar)<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Chapter 4<p>- Spoiler -<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>All original Ranma ½ Characters and Back story Copyright Rumiko Takahashi, and all original DC Characters and Back story Copyright DC Comics Inc., and both are used without permission. Please don't sue... cause I have no money.<p>Any new characters are mine, but they can travel as their bags are always packed.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So, Alfred, how is our young ward doing with his driving lessons?" Bruce asked in his playboy persona as Alfred followed Ranma on who was peeling off driving gloves.<p>"His instructor is both marveled and scared by Master Ranma." Alfred replied showing no outward emotion even though Bruce could tell his old friend wanted to laugh. "It seems Master Ranma has taken to it like a martial art and has given a new meaning to offensive driving."<p>"I'm not that bad! The instructor just doesn't have strong nerves," Ranma exclaimed in his own defense then looked a little sheepish.<p>"Don Tanner is a former NASCAR Driver, I would think he had very strong nerves," Bruce smiled as a short haired blonde woman moved into view behind Bruce wearing a business suit cut for a woman. "Ranma, this is Susan Dayer. Susan this is my new ward Ranma Saotome. Susan was just going over the charity schedule with me that WayneTech is involved in."<p>"Bruce, people are going to wonder about you and all the young wards you take in," Susan joked after Ranma bowed to her.<p>"Wayne-sama... I mean Bruce is my Godfather," Ranma explained carefully. "He has taken me in after my Father passed away from poisoning."<p>"Having lost my own parents to crime I tend to have a soft spot for others who have similar loss in their life," Bruce's smile dropped then came back up in faux mode, "Of course this time it was family."<p>"Yes, and family is important," Susan started to lose her own smile then caught herself. "So, you are starting school next week?"<p>"At the start of the new term, yes," Ranma nodded looking puzzled. "I thought you two were discussing charities but it seems I was the topic of some conversation."<p>"Oh, ah no. I handled your enrollment papers since the school board is one of the areas I deal with for Bruce," Susan replied quicky. "I do have to say that your old school records are a little odd for a Japanese student... several placement tests after missing a great deal of half years."<p>"I was training with my Father," Ranma said without any humour as the subject hurt. "We traveled all over Japan but I only went to school when we got back to Tokyo from time to time."<p>"Oh." Susan said with a thoughtful look but she didn't seem satisfied by the answer. She left the matter at that though.<p>"Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to get changed and work out for awhile," Ranma bowed again then left without waiting for a reply from either of them.<p>"If only that boy were a little older," Susan said to herself with a crooked smile then snapped out of it. Turning back to Bruce she took on a serious face, "Now, about this girl you were telling me was coming to live here too... Ranma's sister I believe you said..."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>-Security photos show Batman, Gotham's Dark Night, and Nightwing, who we have come to understand was Batman's first partner named Robin, barging into a warehouse last night,- Bruce and Ranma frowned at the large television set as grainy footage came on the screen narrated by the anchorman. -Also seen is a person wearing the costume of Robin. So it appears that a new partner has been recruited or the last one has finally come back to the costume after six months. With me is Sargent Bullock of the Gotham City Police force who, having experience with both the Caped Crusader and security camera photos, is here to offer his opinions on this matter.-<p>"Not Bullock," Bruce groaned causing Ranma to raise and eyebrow.<p>-Thanks Stan,- a large barely shaven man in his forties came on the screen looking slightly uncomfortable. -The first thing I can tell ya from these photos is this ain't the old boy wonder, not with those coconuts on 'her' chest. This is more likely a replacement for Batgirl than bird boy since that small dame disappeared about the same time as the other Robin. And let me tell ya all that if this is that we don't need no more freaks in this city no matter what side they pretend ta be...-<p>-Yes, well. . um, thank you Sargent for your expertise in this,- The news anchor looked a little unnerved by the commentary and tried to straighten himself out. -So you heard it here first. Batman has a new partner, and Girl Wonder.-<p>"Coconuts! Is he always that bad?" Ranma blinked disbelieving at the now blank screen after Bruce turned it off.<p>"Yes," Bruce pinched the bridge of his nose with his eyes closed. "There was a time I thought he was a bad cop, but he can actually do his job. He's just a pain in the ass to deal with at all times."<p>"And he seems to like you just about the same," Ranma smirked then sobered. "But I don't like the fact that my girl side is now publicly tied to being Robin."<p>"When you get your new costume they'll see a male Robin... but keeping up this Batgirl in training suggestion might not be a bad idea," Bruce smiled then stood up and headed in the direction of the secret door leading to the Batcave. "You coming?"<p>"Be right there," Ranma replied then snagged the thermos he got from Alfred as he passed the Butler. Ranma had an idea. "Thanks Alfred."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"What's with the thermos?" Nightwing asked as Robin-chan came out from the change room Batman had insisted she use from now on.<p>"I've had enough of Robin, the girl wonder, so I'm going to try something," Robin-chan replied then pour the hot water over her, now himself. The costume shifted but Robin focused his thoughts to end up with something similar to the old Robin costume but had long dark green tights, a long sleeved shirt, and a longer cape. Looking in a nearby mirror set in the confiscated trophies Batman kept from his adversaries he nodded, "Good enough."<p>"Robin, the 'boy' wonder, rides again," Nightwing chuckled as he set his mask in place.<p>"Fine," Batman said in his work voice coming down the stairs from the computer consuls. "Let's get this going. Commissioner Gordon is waiting and we have another appointment to keep."<p>"Hai," Robin replied and leapt into the passenger seat of the Batmobile then waited for Batman to catch up.<p>"I want to research that bracelet later. I know a few people who understand magic, and I've asked Wonder Woman to come and talk to you about the Amazons in China," Batman stated not making it sound like an option.<p>"If you want to," Robin shrugged and looked at the twin dragons which were starting to show in etching on the surface of the perfectly smooth silver. The image was becoming more pronounced over the months, which was odd since the surface had been blank when he first received it. Scratch that, when 'she' first received it.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"This is an unexpected surprise," Commissioner James Gordon smiled towards Nightwing. "Haven't seen you in months Nightwing. And this would be the new Robin... I take it Bullock was wrong about the photos. He went behind my back with that interview..."<p>"He wasn't wrong." Batman replied emotionlessly. "They are twins, and until I'm satisfied she's ready for a different title they share the Robin mantle for now."<p>"Really. It's none of my business anyways. I trust Batman to choose his partners," Gordon shrugged and handed a file folder to Batman. "Here's the information you asked about... and you were right, there has been a number of large shipments in from Japan and China in the past few months. Cobblepot's new company has partial ownership with the importers. Customs says nothing illegal has come through... but we both know the levels of corruption in this city."<p>"He was always trying for a big score, so how did he get the kind of money to pull this off?" Nightwing looked at the open folder posting Penguin's financial holdings. Among other things.<p>"Book deal." Batman said reading the pages quickly. "And not just him either. The Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Pied Piper, and Captain Boomerang have all been paid to help write their various with myself and the Flash, a contrast in styles... others are also being contacted but only those that seem to be trying to go straight finally. The book is going to be more of a criminologist text book explaining their many crimes and why they were caught."<p>"A text book on crime? Handy tool for the up and coming criminal," Nightwing looked annoyed at the idea.<p>"Maybe, but it's being printed by a legitimate publisher for university criminology books," Batman pointed out, "and by a writer I've read and approve of. But even this sum doesn't explain all the money needed..."<p>"Those other two, Faceless and Shameless," Robin commented without really looking at the group. His focus was on a large spotlight. "They acted like arrogant rich kids, and I had a feeling that the Black Rose wasn't at that Jewelry store for the money but the thrills."<p>"You may have a point," Batman replied holding back the smile he wanted to give Robin. "They did say something towards funds and Penguin."<p>"Nothing worse than a rich kid with too much money and boredom on their hands," Gordon said knowingly giving a sideways glance to Batman then quickly focused on Robin. "You can never tell the crazy ideas they'll get in their heads, and put their money behind."<p>"So we have to find out who those two are," Nightwing smiled. "Shouldn't be too hard since the gymnast doesn't cover her face."<p>"It's a mask," Robin corrected giving the spotlight controls a once over. "Her facial muscles didn't move right when she talked."<p>"I was wondering if you noticed," Batman finally smiled.<p>"Great. Looks like I'm the one needing more training again 'cause I missed that," Nightwing looked slightly guilty.<p>"You focused on Faceless since he was your opponent. I had two chances to observe how her face moved," Robin explained with no accusations. "And I'm beginning to see that Batman is just Batman."<p>"Look, I don't want to keep you three up here all night," Gordon smiled actually enjoying having these three talk around him as if he was truly one of them. "But I have to have a talk with Bullock and I have a few files to go over."<p>"And that, I think, is our cue," Nightwing joked.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"The warehouse is clean," Robin stated after landing next to Batman having leapt up from the other roof with a powerful jump. The two roofs weren't too far from each other but it was more that a normal human could jump. "But I have a feeling you expected that."<p>"Yes." Batman nodded slightly. "I have another job for you... to get your mind off of this Black Rose girl."<p>"I'm fine! Really!" Robin protested then sighed, "What's up?"<p>"I've been hearing rumours about a girl in purple and black knock around thugs in Little Tokyo. I want you to see if you can find her, then find out where she goes," Batman instructed firmly. "I'll try to talk her out of this life later... when we've got more time."<p>"Don't like people muscling in on your territory?" Robin commented a little confused.<p>"I don't like amateurs getting themselves hurt in my city," Batman crossed his arms and sounded angry. "Look at what happened to Jason and Barbra... I don't want that to happen again."<p>"I'm an amateur." Robin pointed out a flaw in that statement.<p>"No. No you're not. You've been training for something like this for over ten years," Batman frowned not looking at Robin. "That's what I believe your Father was trying to do. Maybe not for Gotham but possibly for Tokyo... How much of Tokyo do you know? You've lived all over it at different times... no other cities but Tokyo."<p>"Okay. Fine. I'll go watch this girl." Robin agreed not sounding happy about it at all. He turned and leapt away to another roof top.<p>"Diana will be here in a day or so," Batman reminded himself watching the training that Robin had that allowed him to do things normal humans couldn't do.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It had been a quiet night, which meant it had been a boring night for Spoiler. She had only been stalking the night for a couple of weeks but the thrill of swooping in and beating up the bad guys was addictive. She honestly never thought she would have a slow night in Gotham.<p>"Where the heck are they? This is Gotham, there is always crime in this city, twenty-four seven!" Spoiler complained as she rechecked her gear, all bought from catalogs. It was amazing what you could get from Kord Industries, LexCorp, and WayneTech sent to a simple P. and no name.<p>-Relax, I'm sure it'll start soon. It's early,- a female voice replied over Spoiler's WayneTech ear and jaw com. unit, streamlined for professional look and comfort.<p>"Easy for you to say, but I'm glad this suit is water resistant and the cape and hood are water proof, it rained a few minutes ago," Spoiler huddled in the roof crevice she was perched in. "But it's more insulation."<p>-You chose the design,- the voice laughed. -Wait... got an alarm call from Shinora Gems... police aren't coming to this one, it got cut off and then acknowledged as an accidental trip.-<p>"So?" Spoiler sounded annoyed and disappointed at the false alarm.<p>-It was a female caller who acknowledged,- the voice replied waiting for things to click for Spoiler. Sighing she explained, -Mr. Shinora has no female employees remember? He's an old fashion chauvinist and the only people who work for him are his sons and grandsons.-<p>"Right! So whoever called in is probably robbing the place!" Spoiler stoop up and took out the Kord Grappler Mark IV then swung away towards the store. She never noticed that she had an extra shadow.<p>It took only two minutes to get to her destination since she had been close by. Landing in front of the door she shocked a leotard wearing girl who had her face covered with a black and white full mask. Spoiler knocked the girl out before the gun the girl carried could be raised level to her.<p>"Gee, looks like a crime in progress to me," Spoiler whispered into her com. with a smile, she then went into the store. Again she missed her shadow landing behind her checking the fallen girl's pulse then tying the girl up.<p>Spoiler barged into the main showroom area suddenly realizing that she had not prepared to run into eight more girls like the one outside, plus one who wore a mess leotard that seemed to be in charge. She skidded to a halt then struck a pose, "Okay, I know diamonds are a girl's best friend but you can just put them back and give up."<p>"What is it now?" the Black Rose asked in annoyance as she turned and faced the girl who interrupted her admiring of such wonderful jewels. "If it isn't that red birdie girl it's another girl causing me grief and time. Get her girls!"<p>Spoiler was very thankful that the only girl with a gun had been outside since these girls only had clubs and hoops... gymnastic clubs and hoops. She had heard of villains working on a theme but Gymnastics!<p>She dodged a slow strike from one henchgirl who thrusted a now spike ridden club then ducked a thrown hoop than sliced the very end of her cape as it went down with her to hands and tips oaf her toes all fours on the ground. Throwing a kick into the first girl the henchgirl to collapse, then Spoiler threw the dropped club she caught on it's way down at the hoop girl, sending her to the ground twitching.<p>Thinking that this was not going to be all that hard Spoiler missed seeing the Black Rose lazily whip out a red ribbon, snap it at her adversary as if it was just a pain having to deal with peasants, and wrap it around Spoiler's arms, chest, and neck.<p>"Hey! What gives! This thing's like steel!" Spoiler cried out after trying to flex the ribbon to break, it started to choke her if she flexed too much.<p>"Hohohohoho Silly girl, nobody stops the Black Rose from getting what she wants," the Black Rose laughed but sounded very annoyed. She gave a slight tug on the ribbon line and Spoiler suddenly noticed a lack of oxygen no matter how she relaxed her struggles. "If it isn't one of you morally overzealous girls it's always another..."<p>The Black Rose cut her complaint short as a small flying object cut her ribbon then both Black Rose and Spoiler followed it's arching return path to the hand of Robin, the girl wonder, leaning lazily against the entrance way, "Hello. Private party?"<p>"Ah, the new Robin according to the news," Black Rose smiled evilly at the new arrival even though she was furious at seeing Robin-chan again. "Didn't you learn the first couple of times? You can't beat me... oufph!"<p>Robin-chan removed her foot from Black Rose's stomach, who doubled over from the impact, and causing Spoiler to gasp as she barely registered Robin- chan's move. Robin-chan removed the round blue ball from Black Rose's hand that she had pulled out from behind her back. Spinning Robin-chan back handed the long raven haired girl across the face sending her across the room. Taking a moment she called to Spoiler, "Don't just stand there, take her girl thugs down!"<p>"What? Oh right!" Spoiler blinked then hit the girl beside her with the back of her quickly raised had. The henchgirl went down not seeing it coming since the girl was just as stunned by the new Robin's moves.<p>Dodging a spiked club as the Black Rose attacked back Robin-chan moved past punching the villainess in her already heavily bruised stomach sending her to the ground again. Turning an eye on the other girl she was impressed at how easily Spoiler was dealing with them, but that moment caused the unthinkable to happen. Robin-chan was raked across the back by the spiked club still in Black Rose's hand. Her back was thrown into agonizing pain causing her to fall to her knees in an arch.<p>"Oh Hohohoho, not so mighty now!" Black Rose laughed behind her daintily raised hand then coughed twice. "I hope you like my inferno chemicals that's in your wounds. The pain they cause could drop an elephant to the ground whimpering for help..."<p>"This. Does. Not. Hurt. That. Much!" Robin-chan said though gritted teeth as she stood, turned, then started walking towards the Black Rose as if the pain was just a minor annoyance.<p>"Damn you bitch! Can't anything keep you down!" the Black Rose nearly screamed, the tension and anger strong in her tone, as she pulled out another small ball and dropped it at her feet causing smoke to rise and her to vanish yet again.<p>"COME BACK HERE!" Robin-chan screamed in frustration then her body dropped to the ground.<p>"Hey! Are you okay?" Spoiler dropped the henchgirl she was restraining and ran over to the red haired girl. "I thought you..."<p>"Got to get out of here... before the cops come," Robin-chan said in a shaky voice as Spoiler helped her stand.<p>"You need medical help," Spoiler replied but helped Robin-chan to walk out the door.<p>"Going. . to call. . Batman," Robin-chan said very shaky as she pointed to an alleyway. "You. . don't want to be. . her when he. . comes. Trust me."<p>"I'm not leaving you in an alleyway in Gotham at night! You can't even defend yourself right now," Spoiler said with iron in her voice and conviction. "Just call him, I can take care of myself with him."<p>"Your choice," Robin-chan choked out wanting to smile as she liked the fire in this girl. Pressing the button on her belt she activated her com. system which she had put on silent while shadowing Spoiler. "Oracle? This. . is. . Robin. . hit by. . paralyzing. . and toxin. . need help. . soon."<p>"Oracle? I thought you said you were calling Batman?" Spoiler asked totally confused as she threw a LexCorp FlashBang into the alley to make sure it was empty. She shielded her eyes since her flash suppressor lenses, also from LexCorp, had come faulty. Once she was sure the small alley was safe she helped Robin-chan in and sat down using her own body to rest the red- head on.<p>"Didn't need the flare but it was a good idea," a strong voice said from off to Spoiler's right a few minutes later causing her to jump slightly and look directly at Batman. Robin-chan barely groaned.<p>"You just love to do that don't you?" Spoiler asked sarcastically as she helped the now unconscious Robin-chan up and tried to get her heart back to a more regular rhythm.<p>"Scares the criminals," Batman replied humourlessly as he helped pick up Robin-chan and examined her wounds on her back. "Not congealing naturally. She might bleed out."<p>"You don't sound very concerned about that." Spoiler tried to hold back the horror building at seeing this legend's attitude.<p>"I'm very concerned, but she has already slowed down her bleeding and she is only unconscious because she chooses to be," Batman explained sternly even though the girl was showing a strong face to him. He knew she was scared of him, but she was standing up to him. He continued as a motorcycle came up the alley, "She has slowed her heart beat to slow the spread of the poisons."<p>"The Batmobile is behind me," Nightwing stated as he brought up a medkit to start first aid so they could stabilize Robin-chan enough to get her to proper care.<p>"We'll take her back to the cave and test the toxins," Batman picked up Robin-chan easily again and started to walk to the waiting Batmobile but Spoiler grabbed his arm.<p>"I'm going with you!" Spoiler stated in a tone that said nothing was going to stop her. "She got hurt helping me."<p>"You aren't coming," Batman gave a final tone as Nightwing opened the passenger side of the vehicle trying not to smile since things were too serious for that.<p>"Oh? And how do you plan to stop me?" Spoiler crossed her arms and gave a stubborn look. "I could simply follow you."<p>"And I could simply use knockout gas on you," Batman replied then turned as Nightwing strapped Robin-chan in. "Look. . ah. ."<p>"Spoiler," Spoiler said not changing her tone or stance. "I spoil criminals fun."<p>"Look Spoiler, arguing is taking up time we do not have!" Batman started to sound angry.<p>"Then stop arguing and just take me along," Spoiler smiled in triumph causing Nightwing to finally laugh.<p>"Nightwing, deal with her," Batman thinned his lips and got into the Batmobile not trusting himself to say anything more to the girl.<p>"And what does he expect me to say to her after that?" Nightwing said very quietly to himself before turning and giving Spoiler a look just as stern. Spoiler still had her arms crossed over a very small chest and not looking ready to back down.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Weird place," Spoiler said a little awed at the size of the infamous Batcave.<p>-Sis? Where have you been!- the voice in her ear asked sounding very worried. -You're off my scope completely and I couldn't raise you!-<p>"They gave me communications back?" Spoiler said to herself in shock before replying. "I'm in the Batcave..."<p>-Yeah, right,- the voice said not believing a word of it.<p>-This is Nightwing. Spoiler is currently with myself and Batman in the Batcave,- Nightwing cut into the line. -your sister will be back soon but she chose to be her so don't be concerned. We are going to cut this line again until she is outside in a safe area again.-<p>-Sis? Is everything okay?- the voice sounded even more worried now.<p>"I'm fine. Talk to you soon," Spoiler replied then heard the line go dead indicating her com. was useless again.<p>"Don't worry, Robin will be fine. Batman has already identified the toxins used and is treating the poisons," Nightwing said as he came up behind Spoiler and put a hand on her shoulder.<p>"Can I sit with her?" Spoiler looked up but her full faced mask hid the pleading in her eyes.<p>"I doubt we could stop you," Nightwing chuckled as he led her towards the med bay. "I haven't seen anyone stand up to Batman like that in a long time... and definitely not by a newbie."<p>"I was scared actually," Spoiler looked down embarrassed.<p>"We know, but you still did it and Batman was impressed... but you could have chosen a better time," Nightwing smiled as they came into the med bay where Robin-chan laid face down with her back bare.<p>"With the toxins dealt with she started healing at an accelerated rate," Batman said to Nightwing sounding impressed but looking bothered. "All the tests say she isn't a meta...yet."<p>"As for you," Batman stood in front of Spoiler, who stubbornly looked up feeling her iron coming back. "This isn't the life for an amateur. We do it out of need. We've all lost family to crime and it has driven us to deal with criminals the only way Gotham understands, but it's a hard life and not something to take lightly or as a hobby."<p>"I don't take it as a hobby!" Spoiler replied in anger that she couldn't stop from flaring up. "And how do you know I haven't lost family to crime too!"<p>"Because I know who you are Miss Tendo," Batman said calmly but in a tone that sounded like a disappointed parent catching their child guilty of bad things.<p>Spoiler just gaped at Batman wordlessly.<p>-
