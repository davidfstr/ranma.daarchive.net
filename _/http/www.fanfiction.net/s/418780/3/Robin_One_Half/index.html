</div>A Ranma ½ Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Robin 1 / 2<p>- - - -<p>By Felix Webster (Felix Warstar)<p>- - - -<p>Chapter 3<p>- Batcave -<p>- - - -<p>All original Ranma 1/2 Characters and Back story Copyright Rumiko<br/>Takahashi, and all original DC Characters and Back story Copyright DC<br/>Comics Inc., and both are used without permission. Please don't<br/>sue... cause I have no money.<p>Any new characters are mine, but they can travel as their bags are<br/>always packed.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma watched Bruce check for brusing around where most of the<br/>damage had been the morning before and frowned as he could see a<br/>whole new set developing. It was pretty early in the morning and once<br/>again Bruce had just gotten in, he was doing something that wasn't<br/>healthy for him and what Dick was wearing the day before had<br/>something to do with it.<p>"You need the salve again Wayne-sama?" Ranma asked thin lipped<br/>deciding to finally get the attention of his guardian.<p>Bruce looked over not at all surprised by the boy being there, "No,<br/>that's okay Ranma. . and please just call me Bruce."<p>"As you wish," Ranma replied in a slightly cold tone. "When's Dick<br/>getting here?"<p>"He's upstairs in his room right now," Bruce lifting an eyebrow at<br/>the tone. "He stays here when he's in Gotham."<p>"How long do you think he's going to be sleeping?" Ranma asked still<br/>sounding unhappy.<p>"Why? Is there something you two are supposed to do today?" Bruce<br/>repressed a smile as he knew full well what Dick and Ranma was<br/>supposed to be doing.<p>"Yes. He's going to explain to me why he was wearing that wierd<br/>outfit yesterday, and explain what it is you do at night that gets<br/>you so banged up," Ranma crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes at<br/>the man. "Unlike some people who said they'd talk about things the<br/>other day."<p>"Ah that's what's wrong," Bruce said mostly to himself in<br/>realization of what was bothering Ranma. Standing he walked over to<br/>Ranma before continuing, "We will talk about that. . but I'm going to<br/>let Dick try to explain things first."<p>"Fine," Ranma replied as he turned away and started to leave.<p>"Oh and Ranma, you start taking driving lessons tomorrow," Bruce<br/>stated once he remembered that he had set that up.<p>"Driving lessons?" Ranma turned an looked confused at Bruce. "Why<br/>driving lessons?"<p>"Well for one because you're sixteen and every guy about you age has<br/>his licence," Bruce replied smiling at the boy. "And two because I'm<br/>giving you a car to get around town in so you're going to have to<br/>learn to drive it."<p>"You're giving me a car? Why?" Ranma asked now even more confused.<p>"It'll make getting around Gotham a lot easier, it's a big city,"<br/>Bruce continued to smile but was a little confused at Ranma's reaction.<p>"Okay I guess. . . if it's what you want me to learn then I guess I<br/>learn how to drive," Ranma replied with a shrug then finally left the<br/>room.<p>- - - -<p>"I don't get it," Ranma stated for the third time since Dick had<br/>started with the explainations of his and Bruce's nocturnal activities.<p>"The world is full of all kinds of heroes. Some of them are true<br/>superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman, but they deal with the<br/>threats to the world and some places need a different kinda hero.<br/>Gotham is one of those places," Dick explained again trying not to<br/>look annoyed at the boy's nonunderstanding. "Gotham needed a darker<br/>hero to deal with the crime and corruption and to this Batman was<br/>born."<p>"No no, I got the 'Gotham has a dark hero' part it's just I have no<br/>idea who you've been talking about," Ranma replied back as Dick<br/>obviously misunderstood him. "Who is Superman or Wonder Woman. . .<br/>heck even those names are ridiculous."<p>"Hey! Wonder Woman is a friend! And her name isn't ridiculous!" Dick<br/>looked very angry for a moment then it clicked and he looked shocked<br/>at the Asian boy. " mean you haven't even heard of Superman!"<p>"Nope. Pop was a firm believer that anything that wasn't related to<br/>the art wasn't worth bothering with," Ranma explained calmly even<br/>though mentioning his Pop hurt him with the pangs of loss.<p>"Oookay. . . I guess I have to start at the top then and work up to<br/>people like Batman," Dick replied still shocked, he thought for sure<br/>that everyone on earth had at least heard of Superman.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow at Dick in disbelief, "A man who is faster<br/>than a speeding bullet? Can leap tall buildings with a single bound?<br/>And is more powerful than a. a. ."<p>"More powerful than a locomotive," Dick finished for the other teen<br/>then noticed the look. "Hey I didn't come up with that! It was in the<br/>first piece written about him."<p>"Well. . I'm fast, strong, and I can leap small buildings in a<br/>couple of bounds. . you think he's looking for a partner?" Ranma gave<br/>Dick a lopsided grin.<p>"He flys, is bullet proof, and can lift oil tankers out of the<br/>water," Dick replied trying to clearify his description.<p>"Ah. . I guess not then," Ranma chuckled slightly then turned<br/>serious again. "This sounds too comic like. . . I mean manga like. .<br/>. blasted translation spell!"<p>"Wait until you meet him. . he can be a little too unrealistic some<br/>times, it's one of the reasons he's called the world's biggest<br/>boyscout," Dick said remembering the few times to two had met.<p>"I'll try to remember that," Ranma replied still not convinced.<p>- - - -<p>"What the. . .?" Ranma stated in shock and amazement at the sight of<br/>the large cave that they were desending into. It was massive and<br/>seemed to have no end anywhere Ranma could see. The stone and metal<br/>stairwell seemed to be crafted into the wall as an extention of the<br/>cave instead of an addition and the platforms he could see where<br/>designed similarly.<p>"Welcome to the Batcave," Dick replied as he swept his arm out to<br/>encompass the entire area. "Very few people have ever laid eyes on<br/>this place."<p>"It might be because of the bats," Ranma said as he pointed up at a<br/>cluster of said creatures that had burst into flight at the sound of<br/>Dick's loud statement.<p>"Don't worry they're not much of a problem. We use sonics and force<br/>screens to keep them away from the used areas of the cave," Dick<br/>explained with a smile. "It wouldn't be much of a Batcave without<br/>bats in the cave."<p>"This place must effect your humour too," Ranma said to himself as<br/>he gave the cave more and more of a look as they neared the first<br/>platform. He looked over at the display cases that Dick was trying to<br/>draw his attention too.<p>"These are the costumes that we wear when going out to fight crime,"<br/>Dick motioned to the five display tubes. "They're like uniforms to us."<p>"Uniforms. . yeah, okay," Ranma replied as he looked over the<br/>clothing inside. "Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl. . . one of these<br/>things is not like the others."<p>"Batman was the first, he started fighting crime to avenge the<br/>murder of his parents by criminals in Gotham. Then I became his<br/>partner, Robin, when he took me in after my parents were murdered<br/>while visiting Gotham. Barabra joined us. . for her own reasons. Her<br/>Father is Gotham's Police Commissioner. And then there was Jason. .<br/>." Dick explained as his face harded at each story.<p>"So we all have something in common, having your parents murdered<br/>shouldn't bring a new family together," Ranma said as his eyes<br/>narrowed slightly.<p>"The parents being murdered shouldn't have happened. . but it did<br/>and now we deal with the grief in our own ways. For us it was<br/>stopping bad people from being able to put anyone else in a situation<br/>like we were put in," Dick's voice hardened as his face for a moment<br/>then tried to smile. "So. . whatcha think of the outfits?"<p>"Well. . Batman, Nightwing, and Batgirl's costumes look okay, if a<br/>little dark, but. . . That Robin one looks really silly," Ranma<br/>stated as he gave each suit a better look.<p>"Hey! It was designed after the costume I wore when I was in the<br/>circus with my parents. We were acrobats," Dick replied in annoyance<br/>then calmed down a little. "But I guess I know what you mean. I was<br/>like thirteen when I wore that and by the time I was your age I was<br/>already designing the Nightwing outfit. . . Jason was about as young<br/>as I was when he started so it was fine with him too."<p>"I don't think I could wear that and keep the embarrasement off my<br/>face," Ranma replied as he tried visioning himself in the outfit and<br/>shuddered.<p>"It wasn't that bad!. . And the colours are a tradition now so those<br/>really can't be changed," Dick said in annoyance again.<p>"The colour won't really be a problem, I mean look at what I'm<br/>wearing," Ranma stated with a smile as he swept his hand to display<br/>his red Chinese silk shirt and black loose pants that was his<br/>favorite set. "It's just that I grew outta short pants years ago."<p>"You, me, and Alfred can come up with some ideas later for the<br/>changes," Dick gave the other boy a small crooked smile. "I hear<br/>Bruce wants you to get your licence. . want to see why?"<p>"Sure I guess. . I don't know what's the big deal about some dinky<br/>little. . oh wow. ." Ranma looked dumbfounded at the red car that sat<br/>before him as Dick led him to the parking platform. The car was sleek<br/>and looked like it would be faster than any of the small cars he had<br/>seen in Japan or China, a car that looked like it could do amazing<br/>things like whata he could with the Art. . and Bruce wanted to give<br/>it to him!<p>"Bruce calls it the 'Redbird'. It was originally designed for me<br/>then he had it built for when Jason got old enough," Dick explained<br/>as he almost chuckled watching the boy almost drool. "But I think it<br/>suits you better."<p>"I.I've never had any interest in driving before. . I could get<br/>places faster on foot back home. . but they never had cars like<br/>this," Ranma said quitely then realized the only thing standing<br/>between him and the car was a Driving Licence.<p>- - - -<p>"This is the Batcomputer," Dick pointed out the large video screen<br/>and input consule. "This holds information on all recurring criminals<br/>that tend to plague Gotham. It has links into the Gotham police<br/>computer system and the JLA computers so finding out about people we<br/>encounter is fairly easy."<p>"JLA? What's that?" Ranma asked while he looked the area over not<br/>really understanding the linked to computers stuff.<p>"Justice League of America. It's a group of superheroes who got<br/>together to fight global threats. Bruce is a founding member," Dick<br/>explained. "There is also JLI, Justice League International, and<br/>several others. I belonged to the Teen Titans when it was still<br/>together. . sorta a junior version of the JLA."<p>"Am I going to be expected to join something like that too?" Ranma<br/>looked more curious than annoyed but sounded annoyed about the<br/>prospect of doing such a thing.<p>"That's really up to you. Me and the 'Titans' were friends who<br/>wanted to hang out and have fun. . then it got serious," Dick got a<br/>dark look in his eyes at the end of his statement.<p>"I'm not much of a joiner," Ranma replied as he ignored the look.<p>"You and Bruce both. He only joined the JLA to keep an eye on those<br/>who call themselves superheroes," Dick didn't look like he was joking.<p>"He doesn't trust other heroes?" Ranma looked very confused.<p>"People with powers like that. . Bruce is a believer that power<br/>corrupts people and superheroes like Superman have too much power, so<br/>he watches them to be sure they don't turn on the regular people."<p>"And what does he do if they do turn?" Ranma's eyes were wider than<br/>he'd like but this was starting to make him worry about the safety of<br/>living with Bruce if one of these 'heroes' did go evil and realized<br/>Bruce was perpared for them.<p>"Bruce has contigency plans in the computer for just about every<br/>major hero out there. . And some, like Superman, has entrusted him<br/>with things which could hurt or kill them. . just incase," Dick<br/>replied not looking happy himself about the files.<p>"Great. . ." Ranma still looked concerned but let it go.<p>- - - -<p>"So our identities being kept secret is incredibly important.<br/>Figuring out who one of us is could lead to the rest of us," Dick<br/>explained over a cup of coffee as they sat at a table over looking<br/>some clothing patterns on a computer simulation.<p>"So we can't tell anyone who we really are and what we do?" Ranma<br/>make a few more tweaks to the image as he asked.<p>"It's not a good idea. A couple people know I'm Nightwing but I've<br/>tried my best to make them believe that Bruce doesn't really know<br/>anything about it," Dick replied as he made an alteration to the<br/>image himself.<p>"Your friends in the Teen Titans?" Ranma asked as he changed back<br/>Dick's alteration and made one similiar himself.<p>"I was married to one of them. . so yeah they sorta knew," Dick<br/>answered as he looked over the image change and cocked and eyebrow.<br/>"What's with the yin-yang in silver and gold on the belt buckle?"<p>"It refers to the fact I change from male to female with water, I am<br/>after all the living embodiment of that idea," Ranma smiled weakly<br/>then turned back to the image to think of anything more.<p>"The shirt looks good, it's still red with green sleeves but with<br/>light padding over the vitals areas. The Chinese collar is<br/>interesting as is the the gold frog ties up the chest. . kinda looks<br/>like the shirts you like to wear," Dick glanced at Ranma for a moment<br/>then back to the screen. "The dark green pants look almost black. The<br/>design looks a little loose and you'll want to make them tighter. . .<br/>it's one of the reason people keep calling us the 'men in tights'.<p>Ranma looked at the other teen confused not getting the reference<br/>then back at the image, "I guess so. . I'm not use to wearing<br/>anything tight though. The boots aren't the little shoes of the old<br/>suit, even though I like the loose thin slippers that I use in the<br/>Art."<p>"Yellow mid calf boots with metal inserts, that's gonna hurt anyone<br/>you kick," Dick commented after reading the tag Ranma put to<br/>construction. "I guess green boots with green pants wouldn't look<br/>right, and the boots match the inside of the cape. . And that's<br/>something interesting in itself. I wish I had thought of a black cape<br/>with yellow interior and edging when I was updating the design before."<p>"I'll be less of a target than I would be if I just had that old<br/>yellow cape," Ranma replied proud of the look. "And the larger green<br/>gloves gives more protection than those old ones do."<p>"They're not that much bigger just more padded from the cuffs up,"<br/>Dick stated starting to get defensive of his old costume again. "But<br/>over all it looks like a good design. . I have a few things to add to<br/>the domino mask before I send it to get made but it should be here<br/>before you start school next week."<p>"When am I going to get to go patroling with you two?" Ranma asked<br/>after moving away from the odd computer.<p>"Probably not until the costume arrives. . unless you what to try<br/>wearing the old design, I'm sure we have a few in your size," Dick<br/>laughed as he watched Ranma's face twist slightly at the idea then he<br/>realized that they forgot something, he growned and slapped his<br/>forehead. "We haven't made a design for you girl half yet!"<p>"Don't worry about it, the bracelet will just shift this one to fit<br/>my girl form if I get wet. . It might be a slightly more feminine<br/>style but it'll basically be the same design," Ranma replied as he<br/>waved Dick's worry off. "I'll probably use one of the outfits and<br/>shift it into one of the holding spaces in the female version after<br/>the change just in case of problems."<p>"That bracelet is very. . odd. It sounds very useful for someone<br/>like you with that kinda curse but after a few years of dealing with<br/>magic I tend to not trust the stuff," Dick stated as he gave the<br/>silver wrist bracelet a gaze then looked up and shrugged. "But I<br/>don't need something like that and you do so I'll leave it to you if<br/>you use it or not. I'm sure Bruce will too."<p>- - - -<p>"I see you've been shown the Cave, Master Ranma, did all go well?"<br/>Alfred asked as he served lunch to Ranma and Dick.<p>"Yeah, I think I like the look of the place," Ranma replied with his<br/>mouth full as he shoveled the food in.<p>"He seemed to take the idea well. . after I explained about the<br/>world's superheroes," Dick answered Alfred as he got a look from the<br/>man for confirmation. "And the new Robin suit has been designed. I'd<br/>like you to look it over for anything we may have missed."<p>"It would be an honour Master Dick," Alfred said before leaving with<br/>an empty tray.<p>Dick continued eating for a few minutes trying to ignore the human<br/>vacuum near him then he needed to talk, "Ranma? What made you cover<br/>your face like that yesterday?"<p>"Huh?" Ranma looked up from eating again cocking an eyebrow. "I<br/>didn't want to breathe the gas so I covered my mouth."<p>"You could have done anything to cover your face but you gave<br/>yourself a mask," Dick narrowed his eyes slightly as he felt that<br/>Ranma wasn't saying everything.<p>Ranma out his fork down and his shoulders slumped a touch, "Bruce<br/>has gone to a big trouble to take me in. . I didn't want to cause him<br/>problems with me getting into fights and all."<p>"I thought that fighting was a way of life to you," Dick looked<br/>confused.<p>"Pop tried to teach me that, but I seen what some of his fighting<br/>has caused in problems to us later, and I didn't want to bring bigger<br/>problems back to Bruce," Ranma explained quietly then gave a small<br/>quick smile and resumed eating. "I guess my time with the Amazons<br/>changed me more than I realized."<p>"That's another thing. You lived with Chinese Amazons? Wonder Woman<br/>is an Amazon warrior too, from the original Greek version. We could<br/>talk to her about them cause I'm curious if there is any real<br/>connection," Dick added as he started to eat again himself.<p>Ranma simply shrugged not pausing in his eating, he was curious as<br/>why Dick kept bring that up but didn't feel like voicing at the<br/>moment as the plate of spaghetti was just too good.<p>- - - -<p>"So that is what the Batsuit looks like when worn, huh? I thought it<br/>would be a little more lighter in colour but I guess I was wrong,"<br/>Ranma-chan stated was she cocked her head to one side giving Bruce a<br/>once over. She decided not to curse the blasted tap in her bathroom<br/>for nearly exploding on her but it was going to have to be repaired<br/>tomorrow.<p>"Actually it's because of some training I've had in using natural<br/>shadows to enhance the darkness around me," Bruce explained as he put<br/>the cowl in place. "I've seen the new design and I'm sure same<br/>training with work well with that outfit."<p>"You sure you don't want to come with us tonight?" Dick asked as he<br/>set the domino mask of his own costume in place. "I'm sure the old<br/>Robin suit would fight that body okay."<p>"I told you what I thought about that. .outfit, I don't think being<br/>a girl really changes that opinion very much," Ranma-chan crossed her<br/>arms under her chest as she'd been taught in the Village.<p>"And if I asked you to wear it?" Batman asked turning from loading<br/>his belt from a table covered in equipment.<p>Ranma-chan looked almost pained at the man then walked over to the<br/>waiting outfit she had seen Alfred layout, "As you wish Wayne-sama."<p>"It's Batman while the cowl in on please," Batman replied then had<br/>to turn his head away when he realized that Ranma-chan was going to<br/>change right there. "You could use the room over there."<p>"Why?" Ranma-chan looked confused slightly as she noticed that the<br/>lower pants weren't going to allow her to wear her boxers so she lost<br/>them and stepped into the shorts. She was ignoring the fact that both<br/>*Batman* and *Nightwing* were doing their best not to watch her.<p>"How's it fit?" Nightwing asked without looking as he also loaded<br/>his belt then started on the old Robin belt.<p>"It's a little tight in the chest, but I expected that as it was<br/>designed for a boy and not a girl's body," Ranma-chan answered as she<br/>walked forward trying to get use to the feel.<p>Nightwing and Batman both had to cough into their hands to stop<br/>themselves from saying something very very chauvinistic about that<br/>chest, Barbara would have slapped the both of them if she was there.<p>"Something wrong with it?" Ranma-chan asked as she took the offered<br/>belt from Nightwing. "Remember it wasn't my idea to wear this thing."<p>"You were right. . . the costume just doesn't fit you quite right,"<br/>Batman stated as he turned and walked to one of the other tables and<br/>picked up a file folder.<p>"Batman just turned serious, now we're on the clock," Nightwing<br/>whispered to Ranma-chan as she put the domino mask on.<p>"Robin, I want you to read this file while we are in the car,"<br/>Batman said in a very professional tone and held out the file folder.<p>"That's you," Nightwing nudged the girl in his old suit forward.<p>"I know that," the new Robin gave Nightwing a weird look over her<br/>shoulder then took the papers.<p>"You will ride with me in the Batmobile and Nightwing will follow on<br/>his bike," Batman continued as he walked over to the large black car<br/>and opened the top.<p>"Um. . okay," Robin said as she walked to the car giving it a look<br/>of wonder.<p>- - - -<p>"So we are supposed to be waiting for this Cobblepot guy to show<br/>up?" Robin asked looking down the skylight that showed five very<br/>armed men surrounding a small glasses wearing man with a puppet on<br/>his hand.<p>"We refer to Cobblepot as the Penguin, and yes we are waiting for<br/>him to show up," Batman replied very seriously. "Sources said there<br/>was going to be a metting between Scarface and him to night. And<br/>since Scarface is here that make it likely that the Penguin will be<br/>here soon too."<p>"That little guy's Scarface? He doesn't look all that tough. . and<br/>he doesn't have a scar on his face," Robin gave Batman a confused look.<p>"The puppet with the miniature tommy gun is Scarface," Batman said<br/>never changing tone. "The man holding Scarface has some very bad<br/>mental problems which he projects into the puppet."<p>"Great. . I get to deal with loonies all night long," Robin rolled<br/>her eyes.<p>"Just be careful about that little gun, it really fires bullets,"<br/>Nightwing's voice said over the ear radios from his position higher up.<p>"Sure the Puppet ain't magical?" Robin asked either of them.<p>"I doubt it. . . wait a sec, got movement coming in," Nightwing said<br/>with a touch of a smile in his tone, but that turned bad quickly. "It<br/>isn't the Penguin."<p>"Who?" Batman asked looking very unhappy about that.<p>"Don't know. Never seen this one before. Some guy wearing old<br/>samurai clothing. . but he isn't Asian," Nightwing replied halting<br/>between statements as he checked what he was looking at.<p>"Describe," Batman said in more an order then a request.<p>"Caucasian male, dark blond hair, about five foot eleven and maybe<br/>hundred and sixty," Nightwing stated as he watched through his<br/>batoculars. "He's about Robin's age by his looks. . . and there was<br/>someone just slipped in past the guard and the new guy and neither<br/>noticed."<p>"Another player?" Batman said more to himself then to the others.<br/>"Did you catch anything important from the new one?"<p>"Negative, was nothing more then a shadow. . ." Nightwing started<br/>then was cut off as loud sound disturbed the night.<p>"HOHOhohoho!" came a familiar voice from beneath them in the<br/>warehouse.<p>"It can't be!" Robin slapped her forehead and cringed.<p>"I take it that was the girl you and Nightwing encountered the other<br/>day?" Batman asked thinking to himself that the owner of that laugh<br/>was crazier then anyone else below him.<p>"That's the same laugh," Robin replied as she and Batman watched a<br/>girl standing in the center of the room wearing a almost indecent<br/>outfit and twirling a red gymnastic ribbon. "And that's the same girl."<p>The boy that Nightwing mentioned earlier was beside her quickly<br/>seeming to yell at the girl about something as Batman set up the<br/>listening wire.<p>- - - -<p>"I told you to wait in the car!" yelled the boy at the Black Rose<br/>not even looking at the goons who had their guns raised towards them.<p>"Cousin, dear, I will not be pushed to background on this," the<br/>Black Rose patted the boy on the cheek. "So just do your business and<br/>I'll make sure these nasty little men don't try something very unwise."<p>"Do not patronize me woman! I am in charge of our side of this<br/>venture and you will do as you are told!" the boy demanded receiving<br/>raspberry from the girl.<p>"*cough* *cough* I excuse me but. . ." started the small man wearing<br/>glasses but he was cut off by a violent jerk upwards of his hand.<p>"Stuff it dummy!" the ganster puppet yelled at the man he was<br/>attached to. "Listen you mug get that moll in line and get down to<br/>business, I ain't got all night!"<p>"I was under the standing that our. . benefactor would be here<br/>tonight," the boy said in annoyance after turning away from the girl.<br/>It became obvious that his face was covered leaving it a featureless<br/>but looked normal otherwise.<p>"The boss ain't coming for some nobody so quit you whining and<br/>listen up! You gots that!" Scarface emphasized his statement by<br/>firing off a brust into a nearby wall.<p>"Yes, I believe I've got that," the boy stated arrogantly not at all<br/>unnerved by the display as he drew the boken from it's straps to his<br/>back. "But I don't do business with message boys either."<p>"Cousin, dear, did this man just cause us an insult," asked the<br/>Black Rose quirking a smile as she produced a gymnastic club to go in<br/>the hand not twirling the ribbon.<p>"Yes he did," the boy replied getting in a ready stance.<p>- - - -<p>"Nightwing, Go go go," Batman said into his mike then turned to<br/>Robin. "Don't take risks if you don't have too."<p>Robin nodded then followed Batman through the skylight on the cable<br/>they set earlier.<p>- - - -<p>Scarface was about to give the order to wipe these kids noses,<br/>permanently, but before he could the sound of shattering glass<br/>interrupted him. Looking up he was the unfortunately familiar scene<br/>of the Batman coming down on top of them, "It's Batman! Wipe them out<br/>boys!"<p>Robin landed near were Batman had and had to duck a light stream of<br/>bullets strafing the room. She watched as both Batman and Nightwing,<br/>who came in behind the group, quickly deal with the goons then turn<br/>on Scarface and the boy with the boken leaving Robin the Black Rose.<p>Leaping up and over the girl in black Robin landed facing her and<br/>dropped into position ready for the coming fight.<p>The Black Rose smirked at the foolish girl in front of her thinking<br/>that she could take her, then something about the stance clicked,<br/>"Hohohoho, if it isn't the impertinent girl from yesterday. Come back<br/>for some more punishment?"<p>"You got away once! Not again!" Robin yelled back and ran at the<br/>girl letting her emotions get the better of her. She dodged several<br/>strikes from the ribbon and then from the club as the Black Rose<br/>quickly protected herself.<p>"Hohohoho! You think a clumsy little girl like you could ever<br/>catch me!" the Black Rose replied laughing behind her hand then<br/>parried several strikes and kicks that Robin threw at her. Dropping a<br/>rope into her hand she wrapped it around the next kick and spun Robin<br/>off to collide with the boken wielding boy.<p>"Careful there beautiful," the boy said as he caught Robin before<br/>she could fall from the impact. "You should be more weary of my<br/>Cousin's choice of weapons, she knows them well."<p>"I have a few of my own too," Robin replied in a snarl and stormed<br/>away from the boy after putting a foot into his face. She didn't see<br/>him parry something thrown by Nightwing with the boken he used like a<br/>true katana.<p>Reaching behind her she grabbed the object hanging on the back of<br/>her belt and flipped it open. "I hate resorting to weapons but for<br/>you I'll make an example," she snarled as she threw something off to<br/>her left away from her and the Black Rose before charging her again.<p>"Foolish girl! You can not even use what you carry," the Black Rose<br/>smirked as she wiped out her ribbon to catch the girl coming at her<br/>only to have it severed by a spinning flying thing that cut across<br/>the ribbon's path. The next thing she knew was that the girl was<br/>laying blow after blow into her with out mercy until she lay on the<br/>ground barely moving.<p>Robin stood over the girl feeling a lot better about things now and<br/>was about to turn an help the other two when she saw the boy with the<br/>boken pull out a small bag and throw it to the ground. A black cloud<br/>quickly covered the ground and obscured the area and by the time that<br/>it dispersed both the boy and the Black Rose were gone leaving only<br/>Scareface and his goons tied up.<p>- - - -<p>"She got away again!" Ranma-chan threw down her domino mask in anger<br/>as she pace the upper platform of the Batcave.<p>"You handled yourself very well Ranma, I was happy with what I saw,"<br/>Bruce stated trying to calm the cursed girl down.<p>"Yeah, that trick with the Batarang was great for the first time<br/>you've used one," Dick agreed feeling very worried for Ranma-chan.<p>"But she got away again! Don't you care!" Ranma-chan demanded<br/>ignoring the praise.<p>"But Scareface didn't, and since he is an escaped inmate of Arkham<br/>he was highest priority," Bruce said as he started typing at the<br/>Batcomputer. "The Black Rose is only wanted for attempted robbery and<br/>the boy with the boken doesn't even have that much against him."<p>"What you checking up on the computer, Bruce?" Dick asked as he<br/>walked up behind the man.<p>"That mask the boy was wearing was very similar to one worn by the<br/>Question and I was making a request for Oracle to set up a metting<br/>between Batman and him to see if he has any idea where the boy got<br/>it," Bruce replied not looking up from the screen.<p>"I'm gonna go and do some training. I obviously need it if some girl<br/>can hold me off so easily!" Ranma-chan stated in a huff then walked<br/>up the stairs.<p>"She'll get over it, we all had to sometime," Bruce said to Dick<br/>with a sad smile.<p>- - - -<p>Author's Notes: Well it took long enough to get this done. It was<br/>supposed to be only a get the introduction of Ranma to the life of<br/>Batman but I decided I wanted a little action added, and all you<br/>hentai people out there can imagine Ranma-chan in the old Robin<br/>costume. I have a drawing of Ranma in the new Robin costume I will be<br/>posting when I get my web page up sometime soon (just have to learn<br/>how to web design first).<p>If I get some descriptions of things like the Batcave wrong please<br/>remember that there has been a lot of different looks to this<br/>mysterious place, and I prefer a mix of the WB Batman cartoon and the<br/>first movie and that is the way I write it.<p>Next: First day of school, and an unexpected meetings.
