</div>A Ranma ½ Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Robin 1 / 2<p>By Felix Webster (Felix Warstar)<p>Issue #9<p>- First Night in Society -<p>All original Ranma ½ Characters and Back story Copyright Rumiko Takahashi, and  all original DC Characters and Back story Copyright DC Comics Inc., and both  are used without permission. Please don't sue... because I have no money.<p>Any new characters are mine, but they can travel as their bags are always  packed.<p>Ranma sat at the breakfast table waiting for Bruce to come in from an early  meeting with Susan Dayer. Bruce hadn't even been to sleep yet from his own  activities during the night. His breakfast was long gone but Alfred said Bruce  wanted to talk before Ranma left for school.<p>He sat back thinking about the night before, his running around with Akane,<br/>their fighting an opponent like none he had ever faced before, and the kiss he  gave her on the cheek when he left the Tendo house. He smiled to himself, at  the last specifically, he had never felt anything for a girl before. Oh he had  had many possible girls when he was at the village, them always showing up in  many stages of undress not even putting effort in hinting at what they wanted,<br/>but he never felt attracted to them. Even Shampoo, who was as close a friend as  he had could remember ever having, didn't do anything for him.<p>"Ranma, you remember Susan," Bruce came in the room and Susan followed him in.<br/>Ranma tried not the laugh at the fact Bruce looked as fresh as if he had slept  ten hours.<p>"Good morning Ms. Dayer," Ranma nodded politely wondering what was up.<p>"Morning Ranma," Susan returned smiling and took a chair. "I understand you've  got a date for the Charity Ball…"<p>"Two dates actually," Bruce corrected with a playboyish smile.<p>"Two dates." Susan nodded at the correction before going back into why she was  actually there to talk to Ranma. "Very much like Bruce was a couple of years  back. You do realize this is a black tie event and requires a certain level of  dress that high school girls can't possibly afford…"<p>"I already talked to Bruce about helping both girls find proper outfits, which  is probably why you are here," Ranma replied calmly showing no insult. "And  both girls are not just high school girls they are the daughters of Soun Tendo,<br/>a city counsellor who I believe is about to run for Mayor."<p>"Soun Tendo's daughters, doesn't he have like four of them?" Susan looking a  little confused.<p>"But I only go to school with two of them, Akane and Nabiki," Ranma tried to  keep the sarcasm out of his voice.<p>"Is this to show your support for Councilman Tendo's bid at the Mayor's  office?" Susan turned and asked Bruce not sounding like she liked that much.<br/>"You know I've been warning you that you should stay out of the political until  farther into the campaigns…"<p>"I asked them because they are my friends." Ranma corrected firmly showing his  agitation finally. "And, in case Bruce didn't bring you up to speed, they are  also my step-sisters since my Mother is Soun Tendo's wife."<p>Bruce rolled his eyes as Susan did a double take between Ranma and Bruce  unable to decide to question first, "Your mother is Nodoka Tendo! No nonsense  Nodoka!"<p>"You. Know. Her?" Ranma almost couldn't get the question out.<p>"Oh, pleease! I sit on several city fundraisers for Bruce, and she's on most  of the same ones," Susan waved it off as if it should have been expected.<br/>"She's a true pain about getting things done efficiently and dignified  regardless if it will be as boring as watching paint dry. Oh, and she will be  at this event with her Husband… do they even know their daughters are coming?"<p>"Nope." Ranma gave the blonde woman an evil smile. "It's to be a surprise for  them."<p>"Oh just wonderful." Susan rolled her eyes then sighed. "Give me their contact  information and I set up getting a fitting in before Friday. Any more  surprises?"<p>"Nothing I can think of Susan," Bruce replied and led the woman out of the  room to let her go about her day.<p>"It's nice that you are starting to make friends Master Ranma." Alfred  commented as he came in to remove the plates having heard the entire  conversation even if Susan never knew he was near by.<p>"Well Akane is going to around a lot more," Ranma shrugged as he stood up and  started to head for the door which led towards where is room was. "I'm sure  she'll agree to become Batgirl."<p>"And the family will be exist again," Alfred said to the empty room with a  small smile.<p>"Hey Ranma!" Sandra called from the side of the lunch room then was almost  upon the pony tailed boy before he could return her greeting. "Have you seen  Akane today?"<p>"She and Nabiki are taking the day to get some things done," Ranma replied  cryptically as the blonde sat down beside him. "They called when I was driving  to pick them up."<p>"Lucky stiffs, getting a ride to school every morning from a rich hottie"<br/>Sandra joked not noticing Ranma blushed slightly.<p>"I'm not rich, Bruce is." Ranma protested lightly then turned serious as he  looked up at the new shadow in front of him.<p>"Ranma Saotome, I would like to talk to you." Trent Keanu stated as he stood  ram rod straight across the table from Ranma.<p>"What do you want Trent?" Ranma asked not sounding happy about seeing the  Japanophile. Something about the tall older boy had been bothering him for  several days.<p>Trent looked towards Sandra obviously not happy that she was there but chose  to ignore her and turned his head back to Ranma, "I am under the standing that  you are attending the charity ball this Friday night, is this right?"<p>"Mister Wayne is sponsoring the event so yes I'm going." Ranma replied calmly  but didn't hide his dislike of the boy in his tone.<p>"Right.. you are the ward of Bruce Wayne," Trent said to himself as if he had  forgotten that very well known fact. Getting himself back on track he looked at  Ranma again, "As you are new to our cities society scene I was hoping to be  able to help with getting you a companion for the night."<p>"Sorry Trent but you just aren't my type," Ranma said sarcastically and Sandra  giggled.<p>"What? No.. I didn't.. you know I didn't mean myself," Trent stepped back in  total shock then recovered his composure. "I was referring to a member of my  family who is just coming back into society after an unfortunate time away…"<p>"Oh God! You mean your cousin!" Sandra gasped wide eyed in disbelief. "She's  gotten out of Arkham already!"<p>"She wasn't 'in' Arkham at all." Trent replied to the girl his eyes narrowing.<br/>"She was simply consulting one of the Doctors privately who also happened to  work at that horrid place."<p>"She was forced by a court order to get treatment from Doctor Quinn after she  attacked her gym class leaving several so bad they had to be put in intensive  care!" Sandra stood and almost yelled at the rich boy. "She was supposed to be  in full lock up!"<p>"What she was or wasn't to do is none of your concern peasant," Trent  countered in annoyance crossing his arms. Ranma didn't like the sound of any of  this.<p>"I was in that gym class!" Sandra yelled finally and was going to go over the  table at Trent when Ranma put a gentle hand on her shoulder.<p>"I already have a date for the event, two in fact," Ranma said with a slow  smile easing Sandra into her chair. "So, thanks for the offer but no thank you."<p>"Two?" Trent raised his eyebrows at the number then shook it off. "Well Bruce  Wayne like, but I'm talking about a girl of society not just eye candy."<p>"I'm sure that Akane and Nabiki could exactly be called 'eye candy' even  though they are great looking," Ranma replied, his smile a little lopsided in a  roguish manner. "And since their father is a city councillor they are girls of  society."<p>"Akane and Nabiki Tendo? Ha! Not likely!" Trent laughed. "The tomboy and the  mouse are barely girls sometimes, and as for their father… he just an upstart  playing at bigger men's games."<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed at the slights then slapped the table so that a near by  tray flipped and the spaghetti contents hit Trent on the side of his face,<br/>"Ooooh Trent you should be more careful, it seems some one here didn't take  lightly to your descriptions of the Tendos and got you before I could."<p>Trent looked around him glaring at the suddenly quiet lunchroom for the  culprit as he removed most of the mess off his face and shirt. Growling he  turned and stormed out of the room.<p>"I know you did that but how did you do that?" Sandra said carefully in wonder  as the boy whose tray it was blinked in continuing bewilderment.<p>"I'll tell you if it never makes it into the gossip mill," Ranma replied  calming down then smiled at the nod of agreement Sandra gave him. "These tables  are thin and can be made to warp on impact so I hit it and like a wave the  force moved to the tray then I hit it again very quickly causing a counter wave  force the tray to fly up where I wanted it."<p>"Oh… I don't understand…" Sandra blinked totally confused. "I'm failing  chemistry."<p>"Physics." Ranma corrected.<p>"That too." Sandra nodded.<p>Ranma stood looking at the full length mirror in wonder at the tight black tux  with a white shirt adorned with red silk cummerbund and bowtie. He wasn't use  to western clothing, although he had been learning over the time since coming  to Gotham, and this was the oddest so far.<p>"I must say it does look good on you Master Ranma," Alfred commented from just  behind the Japanese boy out of the way of the reflection. The manservant of the  Wayne household also held a small cylinder spray bottle that was barely the  size of a man's pinkie from tip to big knuckle.<p>"Do it." Ranma said closing his eyes and Alfred shook the cylinder once before  spraying Ranma and he felt the cold mist hit him just before the change.<br/>Opening her eyes Ranma-chan looked at the change in outfit happy to see it  wasn't much. Only the cut had really changed so she was still wearing a tux.<br/>"Hit me again."<p>Alfred shook the cylinder twice and then sprayed a warm mist over the girl  causing the change to bring her back to male. Opening his eyes again and making  use the tux hadn't become something different he took the offered item and  slipped it in his pocket. "So once for the mist to be cold and twice to make it  hot… this will be very useful."<p>"I'll let Master Wayne know you like it." Alfred stated with his usual pomp.<br/>"He mentioned that he has set up a meeting this weekend with someone who might  be able to replace your bracelet with something more suitable as well."<p>Ranma took an glance at the magical bracelet on his upraised wrist and didn't  like the sound of that but knew it would happen. He'd been having odd feelings  from that wrist all day and he wondered it the next owner would be coming soon  as he had been warned they would. "It's going to take a lot to do what this  does… but I know how much magic bothers Bruce."<p>"Magic doesn't bother Master Bruce, it's the reliance on magic that does"<br/>Alfred corrected as he folded Ranma's discarded clothes. "It always has a  price, and that price is always too steep."<p>"Are my guests here yet?" Ranma asked trying to avoid getting into a  conversation he would lose even though he had more experience the subject.<p>"Both Miss Akane and Miss Nabiki are getting changed not more than two doors  down next to your other bedroom." Alfred smiled as he put the items away. "Ms.<br/>Dayer brought them in almost an hour ago so it should only take another two for  them to finish dressing."<p>"Nah, both girls are too practical to take that long," Ranma smirked them  walked through the joining door into his girl side's bedroom before going out  the door to the hallway. He found the room the girls occupied by the sign  listing their names and knocked, "Everyone decent in there?"<p>"Ranma? Good!" Nabiki's voice said from the other side and opened the door  only wide enough to pull him in before closing it again fast. "Will you please  tell my sister she needs more makeup tonight! Simple blush just won't do!"<p>"Geez Nabiki!" Akane rolled her eyes pulling Ranma's attention to her then  causing him to blush and turn away since Akane was only in a strapless white  bra and white silk panties. "I don't wear anything else."<p>"I.. I asked if you were decent... "Ranma stumbled over his words as he had to  turn away from Nabiki too as she was only wearing red panties and wasn't  covering her assets. There were odd cut like scars around her breasts that  didn't look very old, still pinkish not having turned white with time. More of  those cut scars were on her right upper arm and just peeking over the top of  her panties.<p>"If that was what you were waiting for then it would never happen," Nabiki  gave a sly smile as she picked up her red dress that cut very low in the front,<br/>hence the lack of bra. "Neither one of us is decent."<p>"You know what I mean." Ranma rolled his eyes.<p>"I told her about your unique problem Ranma, neither one of us cares how you  see us since you turn into a girl and know all the parts," Akane explained  trying not to giggle at his reaction. She smiled when Ranma finally turned  around still looking uncomfortable.<p>"You'd think I'd be use to stuff like this," Ranma sighed and moved over to  Akane's dresser to check the make up available. "Seen more than my share of  bare female flesh between my curse, the girls at the Chinese Amazon village  constantly trying to bed me, and recently the Greek Amazons who never worry  about clothes too much not having any men around to stare."<p>"I wouldn't have pulled you in if I knew that you were so shy." Nabiki  apologised as she took off her gold wire glasses and put contacts in carefully.<p>"Don't worry about it." Ranma pick up a small brush and put some colour on it  before crouching down to eye level with the seated Akane. "Will you trust me?"<p>Akane looked nervously at the brush before looking directly into Ranma's eyes  then steeled herself to reply in a whisper, "Always."<p>Nabiki sat back having finished putting her dress on and watch is wonder as  Ranma started to apply make up like a pro on Akane's face. After only a couple  of minutes he was done and she had to admit she had never seen Akane so  beautiful after using make up. "I guess I should have waited before putting  mine on after seeing that."<p>"Oh Ranma!" Akane exclaimed as she looked into the mirror so happy. "How…"<p>"The village has all kinds of competitions during the year, and I have a small  problem with challenges," Ranma sat back on his heels then motioned Nabiki over  as he had Akane get out of the chair. He started in on corrected what Nabiki  had already done before continuing, "Not all of them are martial contests. The  village girls thought they could get a chance at me by getting me in the beauty  contest, using the excuse of having to teach me the basics of make up and  everything, so I got challenged by a girl who poked at my new appearance day  after day. They miscalculated as Elder Cologne saw it coming and decided to  teach me herself, and let me tell you I've almost never been through such  intense training before that. It wasn't even martial and it was tiring and  painful." Ranma changed colours without even looking at the palette and added  something from Nabiki's throat hollow to just above the crest of her breasts.<br/>"Before you ask if I won, I didn't, I got second place right behind Shampoo…<br/>Elder Cologne's great granddaughter, but I did beat the girl who challenged me.<br/>There, that looks like a good match to your dress."<p>Nabiki turned to look at what Ranma had been doing and gasped as a tattoo like  oriental dragon crested up from her breasts to end looking outwards at he  throat. The colours alone were amazing, especially using only normal makeup.<br/>"Th.. this is incredible. I love it!"<p>"Wow, can I have one?" Akane asked as she looked at the design in the mirror  over her sister's shoulder.<p>"Get your dress on and I'll see where it will work." Ranma smiled now very  comfortable.<p>A while later Ranma came down the stairs with Nabiki, in her red dress cut so  deep in the front that it tucked into her waist line, on one arm and Akane on  his other. Akane was wearing a white sleeve dress with black edging, shawl and  sash, her right arm had a circling oriental dragon coming down from her  shoulder to end at her back of her hand. Nabiki's dragon had changed to one  that came up her back, circled her shoulder and ended over her exposed bosom  area, hiding many of the visible scars.<p>The trio earned the watching of the entire crowd and Bruce met them at the  bottom of the stairs with an odd smile on his face, "I don't remember either of  the Tendo sisters having Dragon tattoos when they got here earlier…"<p>"It's just makeup covered with nail polish so it doesn't rub off Mister  Wayne," Nabiki smiled at the Billionaire moving her shoulder coverings to show  a bit more. "Ranma is such an imaginative artist."<p>"I'm sure he is," Bruce kept the smile up as he gave Ranma a glace causing the  Japanese boy to blush lightly. "I need to introduce you to some people Ranma…"<p>Ranma, with the girls on his arms, spent the next hour just meeting people,<br/>most older than Bruce but a few just a little older than himself. Many comments  about the Dragons were asked and everyone who asked gave reactions, of shock or  knowing sly smiles, when Akane and Nabiki kept explaining that it was Ranma's  work. At the end of the hour the trio found a somewhat quiet corner and sat  with a punch glass each.<p>"I hope that's non alcoholic," A strong voice said with obvious mirth in his  tone causing the three to look up a who Ranma recognized as Commissioner  Gordon. "Hey Soun, I've found your daughters."<p>"My daughters?" Soun Tendo came up, with Nodoka in tow, looking confused,<br/>causing the trio to become worried. "I didn't know I had daughters here… Akane?<br/>Nabiki?"<p>"Hi Dad." Akane smiled up at her tux wearing father, and high collared black  dressed Stepmother.<br/>"Hi Daddy." Nabiki stood quickly and gave her father a peck on his cheek  before sitting down again.<p>"Nabiki Tendo! What is that mutilation on your body?" Nodoka asked in an  angry tone as she looked between both Akane and Nabiki's Dragons and felt the  more indecent one needed to be dealt with first.<p>"Wha? Oh you mean the Dragon," Nabiki first narrowed her eyes then rolled them  when she realized the woman didn't mean the scars that Nodoka knew all about. "<br/>it's only drawn on so it will come off. Personally I love Ranma's work."<p>"It's indecent!" Nodoka argued then realized what was said and turned on her  son. "This is your doing? Isn't it bad enough that you have destroyed my  Sakura's only chance to be a proper girl now you have to pervert Soun daughters  too?"<p>Ranma was about to protest but Akane cut in first, "I think Ranma is a genius  with makeup, I mean just look at the amazing work he did on my and Nabiki's  faces, and then to be able to draw such realistic Dragons…"<p>"Gee, thanks." Ranma rolled his eyes knowing that wasn't going to help his case.<p>"Makeup? Why would a man need to know anything about makeup?" Nodoka asked  totally confused and feeling weak.<p>"I think I've gotten into something that isn't any of my concern," Jim Gordon  said to Soun trying to distract Nodoka.<p>"Ranma is Nodoka's son from her first marriage." Soun explained as he and  Gordon moved away and back into the main room. "We though he was dead until  Bruce took him in… she isn't taking it well, that and the fact he refuses to  come live with us."<p>"I think I can understand why," Jim Gordon replied looking back at the three  teens and one angry mother.<p>"Ranma doesn't care about Bruce's money." Soun stated matter-of-factly not at  all offended.<p>"That wasn't what I meant," Gordon took a sip of his scotch on the rocks.<br/>"Living in the same house with someone you like in a dating way would just  cause no end of troubles. And both those girl like that boy, and I think he  likes them both back."<p>"Akane has the advantage there," Soun nodded and waited for his wife to return.<p>"This thing about her son not being dead isn't going to be a problem? His  father isn't also alive?" Commissioner Gordon asked with concern for his friend.<p>"No, Genma Saotome is dead.. he just didn't die when we thought he did. Me and  Nodoka are legally married as the Japanese government declared him that ages  ago." Soun replied watching the four in the corner carefully as Nodoka wasn't  letting up. "I'm more worried about how she's going to react to a daughter she  doesn't know she has…"<p>Jim Gordon gave Soun a curious look but left it at that as Nodoka finally left  the teens and stormed back to her husband, with each step she changed slowly  back to being a the perfect example of society looking as if she had done  nothing more than had a pleasant conversation a moment before. "I'll finish  that discussion with the girl when they get home tonight."<p>Ranma found himself stuck in a conversation with another teenage boy, a son  brought along by his rich parents, a while later when the girls went off to the  ladies room. He barely understood what the guy was going on about when a sudden  chill ran up his back.<p>"Ohhohohoho! It's nice to get out again to a proper function Cousin dear." A  voice caused Ranma to spin and he had to force himself from going into a  defensive stance. He spotted Trent Keanu immediately but the tall girl next to  him was where the sound had come from.<p>"I can't believe they let Kimberly Keanu out so soon," the boy Ranma had been  talking to said with distaste in his mount.<p>"Kimberly Keanu? Is she Trent's Cousin?" Ranma asked as he put an image of the  girl dressed in a black strapless into a tight gymnastics outfit and masked her  face.<p>"Oh, you know Trent? Why yes she is?" the boy sounded shocked.<p>"I go to school with him. He tried to get me to bring his Cousin tonight"<br/>Ranma replied through gritted teeth. "I already had a date."<p>"Two in fact," the boy in the tux smirked. "And I'd say you lucked out on that  front. Those two girl look wonderful, and Kimberly is a loon."<p>"So I've heard. Excuse me… I have host duties." Ranma nodded absently then  walked off towards the new arrivals.<p>"Trent. I see you finally arrived," Ranma greeted smoothly as he came up on  the pair then took the hand of the black haired hair, "And I would take it that  this is that Cousin you mentions to me before… Kimberly if I'm not mistaken."<p>"Ah, yes…" Trent looked confused and Kimberly was shocked as Ranma kissed the  back of her glove. "Kimberly this is Ranma Saotome, he is the current Ward of  Bruce Wayne, I mentioned him to you…"<p>"Oh.. yes, I remember." Kimberly said in a small voice as she suddenly didn't  know what to do with her hands how that she had both back. The blush on her  face seemed very out of place, and would have scared Trent if it didn't shock  him so much. "I can see Mister Wayne has made a better choice this time than  that boy who got himself shot."<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes for a moment but the look was gone before either Keanu  noticed it. "Well he doesn't exactly pick us from a catalogue."<p>"What? Oh, I see, yes, I guess that would be odd if he did…" Kimberly blinked  until she made the connection. "Have I met you before? I keep thinking I know  you."<p>"I had that same thought but I'm sure I'd remember you." Ranma gave a small  smile that had no warmth behind it.<p>"Ranma, I see you have already greeted our new guests," Bruce said with a more  normal smile as he came up behind the teen. "Although I believe your dates are  feeling a little abandoned."<p>"What? Oh, ah right." Ranma looked over at the two Tendo girls, Akane looked  miffed and Nabiki had a slight smirk. Turning back he gave a small bow, "I'm  sorry but duty calls."<p>"That's quite alright." Kimberly said sounding breathless and watched him walk  back to the other girls as if in a daze. When she finally recognized the two  girl she frowned in total unhappiness. When Bruce Wayne had moved on she sun on  her Cousin, "What are those two doing here? How could they even get into a  event like this?"<p>"They are the dates of Ranma." Trent Keanu replied as if it was nothing  important. "And their Parents are here too."<p>"WHAT?" Kimberly nearly shouted them turned quiet after blushing at her own  mistake. "What? I thought he was warned?"<p>"Apparently not sternly enough." Trent replied still acting all gentlemanly  showing no signs of the evil thoughts going through his mind.<p>"Having fun talking to the crazy Keanus?" Akane asked sounding as miffed as  she looked when Ranma reached her and Nabiki.<p>Taking a look to make sure they wouldn't be over heard Ranma moved Akane, by  the arm, and Nabiki into an alcove before saying, "That is the Black Rose."<p>"What? Who?" Akane asked in shock and fear.<p>Nabiki looked back into the room before replying, "Who? Krazy Kimberly Keanu?<br/>Are you sure?"<p>"Kimberly Keanu?" Akane sat down on a conversation bench hard in total shock.<p>"Yes I'm sure." Ranma said starting to get annoyed. "As soon as I heard that  laugh… I've faced that bitc.. faced her enough times to have that horrible  laugh anywhere. She doesn't even try to change it's tone."<p>"What.. what are we going to do?" Akane asked looking up into Ranma's eyes  worried. "I didn't bring my costume…"<p>"You can't do anything, either of you," Nabiki cut her sister off. "You can't  just go swinging in there accusing her of being a criminal, she's here under  invite and not wearing her criminal identity."<p>"Nabiki is right," Ranma calmed himself down and watched as Akane did the  same, although she looked more disappointed. "At least we now know where to  start in stopping her next time… and if she is the Black Rose then Trent is the  first choice of suspects for that faceless samurai."<p>"Ladies, and friends, talk you all for coming tonight," Bruce Wayne spoke up  over the noise pulling the attention of the trio and hushing the crowd to be  able to hear him better. "The children's hospital will greatly appreciate the  money raised here, but I'd like to take this time to have the pleasure of  making another kind of announcement. As you all know our Mayor, a wonderful man  of many terms, is not running for re-election as he has been called on to take  a seat on the senate that has unfortunately opened between calls. This of  course leaves a great chase for a newcomer to show his, or her abilities now…"<p>"Finally decided to throw your own hat into the ring Bruce?" a male voice  joked from the back of the crowd.<p>"Me? Oh no, I'm no politician, I'm barely a businessman," Bruce smiled earning  a few laughs mostly because he had such a successful company. Turning serious  again he got back on track, "As you all know I also have stayed out of the  politics of our fair Gotham but now I believe I can not do that anymore. My  conscious would never allow me not to endorse a man I know will make the next  great mayor. So, I'm proud to announce my friend, Soun Tendo's bid for the  office."<p>There were several sounds of shock, and many more heads nodding as if this was  only proper, as Akane and Nabiki turned and looked at each other mouthing the  word mayor with a heavy question mark.<p>"As most of you know Soun has been a member of the city council for several  years, a man of honour that has rarely been questioned, Soun come on up," Bruce  waved his friend to the stairs that he stood a few up on to be seen.<p>The trio sat back shocked. Nabiki was the first to talk, "Our Daddy becoming  mayor… now that is something."<p>"In Gotham, it's a very dangerous job," Akane reminded her sister. "And we'll  be watched closely too."<p>"I doubt that will be a huge problem if we work at it." Ranma said seriously  as he was starting to wonder what the people who attacked mister Tendo's family  before will think of this.<p>"Akane's worrying to hard," Nabiki sighed softly. "There hasn't been any  attacks on a Mayor since before Mayor Gavin took office, things quieted down."<p>"Except that before Mayor Gavin three Mayors were killed in the job, two in  their own office," Akane retorted in annoyance.<p>"The weren't as skilled as your Father. He can easily take care of himself…<br/>It's you girls I'm worried about," Ranma said watching the Keanu Cousins which  he could just see from their nook across the room, neither were smiling about  this.<p>"Ranma, could I talk to you for a moment?" Soun Tendo asked as the party  started to finally lose steam. A good many had already left so they could  easily find privacy.<p>"What can I do for you Mr. Tendo?" Ranma asked after being led to a quiet  place, both girls had gone to get changed.<p>"Please, call me Soun," Soun said quickly then sat down. "I'm sorry about your  Mother earlier, I thought the girls looked beautiful. It was nice seeing Nabiki  out of her coveralls for a night, but I wish you might have warned me…"<p>"I thought I mentioned that I asked them?" Ranma looked confused.<p>"Oh, no I meant Bruce announcing like that," Soun waved it off. "I wasn't even  sure yet…"<p>"I didn't know he was going to do that. It caught me by surprise too," Ranma  replied as he also sat down, he turned worried. "You know this might make the  people who attacked your family to come back again. I'm going to have to be  over a lot more… I'm going to need to tell my Mother about the curse 'cause I  can't keep it from happening very much."<p>"Ah, the curse…" Soun say a little nervously. "About telling your Mother about  your curse…"<p>"I know she isn't going to take it well, I know all too well about her ideas  when it comes to men and women," Ranma rolled his eyes, "but it has to be done  sooner or later and sooner would probably be better."<p>"Oh, it's not that." Soun waved it off. "I kind of already told her."<p>"You told her?" Ranma raised an eyebrow in disbelief. "She.. she didn't say  anything… did she even believe you?"<p>"She called Bruce right afterwards to get confirmation. He had pictures  dropped off and she believed it immediately as you look a lot like her when she  was your age… and Sakura is the splitting image of you, hair and all."<p>"She knows…" Ranma turned very nervous trying not to look for the sword coming  for his neck. "How long?"<p>"Yesterday." Soun looked apologetic. "I didn't tell her anything else."<p>Ranma sighed in defeat, now that his Mother knew things could get weird. He  was planning on telling her but HE wanted to have been the one to do it. "Did  she take it well?"<p>"Kind of," Soun gave a short laugh confusing Ranma again. "She started to  discuss with Bruce when and how to set up a coming out party for your girl  half. All women of society go through it in this country according to her, and  since you are living under Bruce Wayne's roof you are a part of society… by the  way what name are you using as a girl?"<p>Ranma blinked at the man for a moment still soaking the information in before  the question clicked, "Ah… Ranko. It's my sister name in China."<p>"Ranko? Sister name?" Soun shaped the word confused.<p>"When I got made a sister they asked for another name for me to be called so I  could be separated in their minds between forms," Ranma explained a little  annoyed that they had wanted to do that. "Pop came up with it and they accepted  it as he was my parent and had the right to name me… It's written 'Wild Child'<br/>not 'Wild Orchid' by the way."<p>"Sounds like a name Genma would pick for a red haired daughter," Soun smiled  then set to leave. "I hope you are coming over soon, other than dropping off  the girls."<p>"In a day or two," Ranma nodded.<p>Batman glanced over at his partner in concern as Robin hadn't said much of  anything since the party. The teen was angry again and he was sure it was at  him once more. They were flying outside of Gotham to meet with another hero who  Batman was sure could help with the bracelet but he wanted to get whatever  Robin was mad about over with first.<p>"What did I do this time?" Batman asked calmly as he moved the controls so to  avoid an air pocket.<p>Robin looked out the side window trying to settle himself before opening his  mouth, a skill taught to him by a very old Elder so he could avoid the infamous  Saotome mouth, "You could have told me that you talked to my Mother about my  curse."<p>"I left a message in your gear's system," Batman raised an eyebrow then put a  hand to his forehead. "You still forget to check those don't you?"<p>Robin frowned without looking back as he focused on the icon over laid though  his mask that activated his connection to the batcomputer, he found six  messages. One of which was from Batman about meeting his Mother. "Damn. I'm  still not too good with this technology…"<p>"I'm still getting use to the new interface myself." Batman admitted back. "We  both have been busy the last little while or I'd have told you in person. I  don't want you angry with me about your Mother again."<p>"Yeah, sorry." Robin replied distracted as he opened an e-mail after reading  one from Nabiki saying she got the address sent. The mail looked to be meant  for Nightwing instead of him. He used a pocket keypad to reply to each then  noticed they were landing.<p>A half hour later they were on top of a building in a city that wasn't Gotham.<br/>Robin looked around at a cityscape that was less dark, less filled with tall  imposing buildings, and less of a place to swing around in. He spotted a figure  moving through the air before it ducked behind another building. He turned to  give Batman a heads up and moved to a better location.<p>"Calm," Batman reminded. "We're here to talk Robin."<p>"And believe me when I say I was shocked to get a call from the Batman to do  just that," a voice stated as a red clad man floated down then stepped off of  two gold disks.<p>"Robin, this is Mister Miracle." Batman introduced his voice it's usual gruff  tone.<p>"Ah, hi." Robin said not too sure about a name like that.<p>"Right back at you," Miracle smiled showing that his totally covered face was  moulded to his features and he had a mouth in his mask. "soooo, Batman, I've  been thinking about the requirements you sent me and I'm a touch confused… I  don't work with magic much, don't you think some one like Dr. Fate would be  better…"<p>"No." Batman returned firmly. "I'm trying to get away from magic hence coming  to you."<p>"Oberon needs me to send a few readings back to him from the changes you  mentioned," Miracle pulled out a oblong thin box with odd looking circuitry on  it. "I'm surprised you go for my kind of tech over magic."<p>"I know more of your type of technology and I know there isn't as much of a  price for using it as there is for magic," Batman explained unhappy about  things. "I'd rather not use your technology either but it's the best choice."<p>"Okay, I'm ready for some readings." Mister Miracle nodded as if he understood  but the look in his eyes said he thought Batman was half crazy. "So do whatever  you need to do."<p>"Fine," Robin sighed as he brought out the new spray canister and shook it so  the top showed blue and sprayed.<p>Miracle raised an eyebrow at the shift then looked to his device, "Okay, boy  turns into cute red head… the bracelet modified your clothes to both fit and to  a more feminine design, nice, and a massive power spike. Now hold off the  change so I can get a reading of that."<p>Robin-chan sighed and shook the canister again do it showed red and sprayed,<br/>focusing on not changing. Mister Miracle nodded at his readings, "A huge power  spike that draws back into the bracelet, recharging it's own source… Oberon is  going to find that interesting. Please change back now." Robin-chan sprayed  again letting herself return to her original male self and Mister Miracle's  head snapped up, "That wasn't a lot of energy, and the clothing shifted again.<br/>I take it the bracelet can't hold back you changing into a girl?"<p>"No, only back into a guy," Robin confirmed. "The bracelet can also hold a  series of outfits for either form, plus mends and cleans them between use."<p>"That part won't take much, the clothing trick is old hat," Mister Miracle  smirked then snapped the device away after running over Robin's wrist once.<p>"So?" Batman asked still in full dark mode.<p>"Oberon will send you his ideas in a day or so." Mister Miracle smiled and  stepped onto his disks again. "I'm sure he'll love the challenge… You'd better  explain about the kind of technology you're asking for to your young partner  though, it's not for most people."<p>"I will, later." Batman replied as Mister Miracle flew away.<p>"I can't believe he was serious," Ranma-chan stated as she sat on Akane's bed  looking at her bracelet worried. She tried to relax in her caprice blue jeans  and red baby tee, something Akane had been shocked to see a boy turned girl  wearing. It showed off the over abundance of chest the girl had. Akane was  wearing similar jeans and a normal blue t-shirt in contrast.<p>"He doesn't like magic," Akane shrugged as she folded her laundry and put  clothes away, "You've said as much before."<p>"But I checked out Mister Miracle on the batcomputer and it says he uses ALIEN  technology, how's that better than magic?" Ranma-chan complained.<p>"I don't see the real difference but I'm sure he does, so just go along with  it since you've said the bracelet has felt weird lately," Akane stopped then  sat next to the red head.<p>"And can you please explain why you're here as a girl?" Nabiki asked from  Akane's doorway back to her stylish coveralls wiping her hands off.<p>"My Mother knows about the curse," Ranma-chan said unhappily, "I'm here  tonight to give her the full show, then try to get it out of her mind the idea  of a coming out party that she suggested to Bruce."<p>"A coming out party?" Akane blinked then looked disappointed. "You get a  coming out party and we get to be the ugly step-sisters…"<p>"You're getting your fairytales mixed up Akane, the step-sisters got to go to  the party and Cinderella had to sneak in," Nabiki frowned at her sister but  then sighed knowing what she meant. "We are part of society…"<p>"The hell you aren't!" Ranma-chan exclaimed with deviousness in her eyes.<br/>"Your Father is a city councillor about to run for Mayor, Our Mother is on  several boards for charities and such, you are part of society but she's been  trying to hide that."<p>"I guess…" Akane didn't sound so convinced.<p>"So you only came over to deal with your Mother?" Nabiki prodded slightly as  she came over to Akane's room after getting an odd e-mail a few moments before.<p>"Nope." Ranma-chan smiled finally as she perked up. "I also want to discuss  how we are going to take down the Keanu Cousins…"<p>AN: Not getting these done as quickly as I expected after getting a laptop so  I could start writing at work again. I've been trying to write something  original finally and it keeps cutting into me working on my Fanfics. I throw  away so much paper restarting my original ideas constantly.<p>So… here we are at chapter 9, and I have to do chapter 10 before I put out the  Annual (with the first Ranma Cast Member to be brought in since the Tendos). I  want to get one more set up point going first.
