</div>A Ranma ½ Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Robin 1 / 2<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>By Felix Webster (Felix Warstar)<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Chapter 5<p>- Meeting a Princess -<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>All original Ranma ½ Characters and Back story Copyright Rumiko Takahashi, and all original DC Characters and Back story Copyright DC Comics Inc., and both are used without permission. Please don't sue... cause I have no money.<p>Any new characters are mine, but they can travel as their bags are always packed.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I don't understand... what happened to Spoiler?" Ranma asked finally able to move without wincing, and happy to be a guy again since Bruce had been worried that the change in height and mass might reopen his wounds. He leaned back sitting on the med bay bed still not wanting to get completely up yet.<p>"I had Nightwing drop her in little Tokyo," Bruce replied standing by the bed wearing his costume with the cowl off. " She was finally satisfied that you were going to live and wanted to get back to her own home."<p>"I kept telling her I was okay but was just very tired," Ranma rolled his eyes but smiled. "I don't know why but I was kind of happy she was here for some reason... silly really."<p>"She's stubborn and very green," Bruce didn't sound happy about things.<p>"But you like her," Ranma smiled at the man earning a surprised look. "I haven't known you very long but I can tell. For one you wouldn't have backed down about her being here if you didn't... heck I can see ideas in your eyes right now."<p>"She has potential," Bruce admitted sounding like it was done grudgingly. "But there are complications I don't want to go into right now that makes what she's doing not a good idea."<p>"Sure," Ranma said mostly to himself as he decided at last that he was being lazy and stood up stretching. "Now, let's get to me screwing up..."<p>"We've all been caught flat footed like that a few times. You lived, learn from it," Bruce sounded harsh at the end but the worry was still in his eyes.<p>"That bitc.. Black Rose got away again," Ranma's mood turned dark disappointed with himself. "Three times now!"<p>"And three times she didn't get what she wanted," Bruce pointed out. "Don't worry, it may be frustrating now but you'll get her. Trust in yourself."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You met Batman!" Nabiki Tendo looked bug-eyed at her younger sister as she nearly bounced in front of Akane who was removing her costume in her room.<p>"You aren't listening Nabiki," Akane sighed again thinking, 'trust a techhead to focus on the wrong things.'<p>"And Nightwing! And you were in the Batcave!" Nabiki looked like she was only seeing what it could have been like to have been there herself. "If only I could get a good look at the stuff rumoured to be in there..."<p>"I said HE KNOWS WHO I AM!" Akane yelled at her sister.<p>"And do you want Father to also know Akane?" Kasumi gave her sister a warning as she relaxed on Akane's bed mending her sister's cape.<p>"Okay okay, so that IS a problem," Nabiki finally focused on the conversation. "Are you going to stop?"<p>"That's what he was trying to tell me to do," Akane looked away annoyed by it all. "But we all know I can't... we can't. Not now at least."<p>"Not until Father is safe," Kasumi nodded not smiling. "And our home."<p>"Maybe Batman could..."<p>"No!" Akane and Kasumi both turned on Nabiki.<p>"Okay okay. No need to go all psycho on me," Nabiki threw her hands up in defeat. "It was just a suggestion."<p>"This is family business," Kasumi stated firmly as she rubbed out a muscle cramp in her still healing leg. "We've been through this before."<p>"I think I'd let that new Robin help... I sort of feel an odd connection with her," Akane looked at her ceiling for a moment then shrugged when Kasumi gave her an odd look. "I don't understand it, I just do."<p>"Well you got Batman's attention now, how do you want to continue?" Nabiki asked pulling out her LexCorp laptop from the bag she brought with her and powered it up.<p>"I met him but I wasn't accepted which means he might interfere when we start going after that bastard," Akane wasn't happy about that possibility.<p>"You got into the Batcave, I'd say that was a bit of acceptance," Kasumi smiled.<p>"I really wish you hadn't been blindfolded going to the cave. I really want to see that stuff," Nabiki sighed disappointed as Akane and Kasumi rolled their eyes.<p>"Trust me, riding on the back of a motorcycle without being able to see is NO fun," Akane frowned as she fought off a shiver at the memory. "I like Nightwing's bike though..."<p>"And Nightwing is so handsome," Kasumi smiled dreamily causing the other two to giggle.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I don't like it Dick," Bruce frowned at the three reports in his hands. Holding the first one up he continued, "All the ingredients in the toxins we've just dealt with are organic and all are from Japan or China. No North American growers are listed. Hell, the seeds for two of them are illegal here."<p>"Like the shipments at the warehouse," Dick looked up from his work on a small dart like object. "You know this rocket dart is WayneTech... Military division. It was discontinued over six years ago."<p>"When I caught Charles Gaines selling the things," Bruce looked over at the dart surprised. "Those are dangerous, very dangerous."<p>"It's been changed from explosive to concussion... I'd say very little real damage but lots of knock back. Skilled modification... barely an extra mark on it," Dick laid the dart down impressed. "I didn't know Nabiki was so good."<p>"You're sure it's Nabiki's work?" Bruce raised an eyebrow as he opened the second folder.<p>"It's the most logical person... she has always loved to tinker with things," Dick nodded a little confused. "But there are a few things I just don't understand about this..."<p>"And this could answer a couple of those things," Bruce lifted the folders. "About seven months ago the Tendo family had a couple of it's girls admitted to the hospital for multiple broken bones. Kasumi is still recovering."<p>"Kasumi was hurt!" Dick nearly bolted out of his chair. "What's the Police report say?"<p>"They didn't file one," Bruce pinched the bridge of his nose. "I should have known about this, but it was right after..."<p>"I'll take a trip to talk to the family before I go back to New York," Dick moved on so Bruce would stop trying to beat himself up over things. "I'd just like to know why you asked me not to tell Ranma about them, he is suppose to be looking for them and they are right here in Gotham?"<p>"This is why," Bruce pushed a photo across the table from his wallet to Dick.<p>Dick took the photo and blanched recognizing the person in it, "But that's..."<p>"Yes, it is, and Ranma doesn't need that right now," Bruce didn't sound happy with himself. "But with Akane playing at being one of us he's going to find out sooner than I'd like."<p>Alfred walked into the room with a small tray containing a small card, "Your Justice League communicator Master Bruce."<p>"Batman, go ahead," Bruce put on the official voice.<p>-Batman, this is Diana... you left an odd message that you wanted to talk?- the voice of Wonder Woman come clearly over the card.<p>"Yes, I recently came across something of interest related I believe to your culture that I need to discuss with you, but I'd prefer if we did it in person," Bruce explained giving very little detail.<p>-Fine... I'll meet you in an hour. I've got to wrap something up here then I'll use the Watchtower's transporter,- Diana agreed as a muffed sound sounded in the background. She didn't sound happy about something.<p>"I'll meet you on the Watchtower," Bruce finished and made sure the card went dead before giving it back to Alfred. "Please find Ranma, we need to be somewhere soon."<p>"A coming out party for our young bird into the superhuman community?" Dick lifted an eyebrow and smirked.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Princess Diana meet Robin," Batman introduced the two relaxing his usual severe tone a bit. "Robin, this is Wonder Woman... the Amazon Warrior Princess I told you about."<p>"Looks the type," Robin said to himself then bowed to Wonder Woman. "Pleased to meet you."<p>"Look, Bruce, if this about your new partner..." Diana sounded perplexed after bowing back, she thought this was serious.<p>"It has to deal with him, but there is more," Batman said trying to ignore the slip. "Robin spent some time in a remote area of China and I was hoping you could shed some light on a little puzzle he brought me..."<p>"I really don't know much about China..." Diana started now even more confused.<p>"I stayed with the Chinese Amazons," Robin filled in the gap left by Batman. The look on the Princess' face made him continue. "They are a group of warrior women who claim over three thousand year old traditions..."<p>"I know who they are," Diana frowned. "At least a little bit about them... but I can't believe you had much to do with them as they enslave strong males for breeding, and if you are good enough to work with Batman you are a strong male."<p>"I did stay with them, for almost six months... and although I got a lot of marriage proposals I wasn't enslaved," Robin replied a little annoyed this woman would suggest he lied. The thoughts about those marriage proposals brought up memories of finding naked girls in his, at the time her, bed each night until the Elders decreed it off limits. "But I do know what you mean, I've seen their laws... thankfully they have gotten a little easier on the enslaving males these days, but forced marriages do still happen from time to time."<p>"We on Themyscira don't allow men at all, but I doubt our sisters would just let you leave," Diana raised an eyebrow still not believing everything she heard but he was with Batman and the Dark Knight didn't pull pranks.<p>"Show her why," Batman said to Robin, who had already had a pre-waiting glass of cold water and poured it over his-her head not looking too happy about changing.<p>"By Hera! The legends are true!" Diana's eyes nearly bugged out of her well structured face at the obvious change. "Our sisters do have the Waters of Womanhood!"<p>"The waters of womanhood? I don't know anything about that," Robin-chan blinked then shuddered at the horrible idea that the Chinese Amazons might actually have permanent water. "I'm under a Jusenkyo curse... It was by just pure chance I got the spring of drowned girl. My Pop got the spring of drowned panda..."<p>"I am unfamiliar with this Jusenkyo but there has been legends for thousands of years about our sisters being able to turn worthy males into proper Amazon warriors," Diana explained. She didn't understand the curse but she did know magic, and the few legends. "They were never said to do it often but each warrior that was changed went on to his, then her, own legend of greatness."<p>"Ah... Well the Elders never mentioned anything like that. All they really told me was that the magic in the springs wasn't really malevolent so it wasn't a punishment for anything that might have been done," Robin-chan shrugged as she combed her fingers through her red hair.<p>"There was another thing... Actually it's the real reason we're here," Batman eyed the silver bracelet that had placed itself over Robin-chan's gloved wrist. "These Chinese Amazons gave Robin a magical object which she was told was an ancient Amazon treasure."<p>"They said it was an ancient Chinese Amazon treasure," Robin-chan corrected as she lowered her wrist so it could be seen better.<p>"Great Hera!" Wonder Woman gasped again as she grabbed Robin-chan's wrist and examined the bracelet closer. "It's not possible! They wouldn't! Not this!"<p>"Okay.. ow.. You can ease up on the arm please.. ow," Robin-chan tried to get her hand back in one piece, she had not expected the woman to be THAT strong.<p>"What? Oh.. Sorry," Diana let go of Robin-chan's hand apologetically. "I know that bracelet as my own mother wears the sister set and I wear a weak copy of that. It's an ancient treasure to be sure, as old as the Amazons themselves, both sets having similar but somewhat different abilities. But I don't understand why you only have one since it's a set of two."<p>"They only gave me one, never saw the other," Robin-chan shrugged again.<p>"You seem bothered about Robin wearing it," Batman said picking up on unsaid tension in his friend.<p>"It's an Amazon treasure, created for women warriors, and it has been given to a boy... even one that turns into a girl," Diana frowned at that.<p>"Strange. I was told that it had been designed to help someone with my problem," Robin-chan replied sounding calm but getting a little scared that the Princess was going to try and take it away from her. "It alters my clothing in both size and style when I change gender. It even holds outfits in a sort of limbo until called for, clothes for both genders. So why would it get enchanted with that kind of magic for a normal woman?"<p>"I can think of a lot of times when a woman could use an extra set of clothes to change into quickly," Diana smiled despite feeling that the bracelet was going to be a problem. "Look... I have to discuss this with my Mother, and she may wish to talk to you about this."<p>"Then she can come and talk to me since you know where and how I can be found," Robin-chan knew that she sounded bratty but she was worried.<p>"That is the only way I can see it happening too, I know men aren't allowed on Themyscira soil," Batman smiling at the fact he had been on the island a few times regardless of that silly law.<p>"And even though I've got a girl's body from time to time I'm all male," Robin-chan stated boldly. Both Batman and Diana could feel the underlying worry about whether that was completely true in Robin-chan's voice.<p>"I think you are more girl than you are willing to admit, and that scares you," Diana said with a sad smile after the pair vanished by way of watchtower transporter.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"She's one of the meta you've been talking about isn't she?" Ranma-chan asked when they got back to the cave, her skin was still tingling from the transport. "She's too strong to be human, and her aura is wrong..."<p>"If you think Wonder Woman is strong wait until you meet Superman or Captain Marvel," Dick Grayson smiled at the pair turning in his chair at the Batcomputer to acknowledge them back. "You can only hold your own with them by using your brain and skill."<p>"And Wonder Woman has all three, power, skill, and intelligence," Batman pointed out with a grim smile. "Superman has power and intelligence but he's still learning skill, he isn't trained for combat regardless of how much he fights. Then there is Captain Marvel, who is a whole different problem."<p>"I could tell she knew how to fight real well from how she moved, a whole lot of years of training," Ranma-chan nodded as she put her domino mask on the nearby table, her eyes showed the worry she felt. "I just don't want her trying to take my bracelet away."<p>"I don't like magic, but from what I could gleam from Diana's reaction I doubt it is a danger in and of itself... just keep inside your glove," Bruce pulled back his cowl and checked the monitor to see what Dick had been working on. "I'll try to see if I can't find you a more technical means to do the same thing then it won't matter if she does ask for it."<p>"If you do it goes back to China, not to her," Ranma-chan sounded firm on that which earned a nod from Bruce. "Oh, and by the way... how does she know who you really are? She slipped near the beginning and called you Bruce."<p>"A small handful of 'Heroes' know who I actually am. And I know who they are too. They feel closer and are more open around me knowing," Bruce explained but he didn't look happy about the whole thing. "It's not an ideal situation but there was little I could do about at the time and now is too late. I can trust the ones who know... and much as I can trust anyone at least."<p>"Or you can expose them too," Ranma-chan nodded earning an surprised look from both men. "The ones who keep their identities secret at least. I've looked over the files and noticed that some like the man who currently calls himself the Flash is publicly known... I guess I better start reading the female files now too."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Okay I'm here. Batman said you wanted to talk to me again," Robin-chan stood with her arms crossed under her assets on the roof of a medium sized Gotham building as the wind blew her hair and ponytail around looking up at the woman floating in the air in front of her.<p>"I came to tell you that my Mother, Queen Hippolyta, wishes to talk to you about many things," Wonder Woman replied in an apologetic tone. "She wishes to know more about our sisters, and their current situation, since it has been many years from hearing anything... and she wishes to discuss your bracelet."<p>"I figured that would come up," Robin-chan rolled her eyes. "And I take she wants to do it there and not here? What if I refuse?"<p>"She, and I, mean you no harm," Wonder Woman said shocked by the hostile tone from the girl. "I don't understand your hesitation, Batman..."<p>"Batman gave me a choice," Robin-chan cut the Amazon Princess off not looking impressed with her.<p>"I.. I didn't mean to sound as if I wasn't also giving you a choice," Diana blinked taken aback by the girl again. "I thought that when Batman said you agreed to meet with me..."<p>"That I'd simply come along quietly like a good little girl?" Robin-chan laughed cruelly. "You want to take me to you island for a couple of days but you don't allow men to touch you soil, your holy ground, anymore. I'm a guy! And any hot water will change me back into one."<p>"I don't treat women like that! That is the way Patriarch's world deals with girls!" Wonder Woman sounded angry for a moment then shook it off starting to think this was a bad idea now. "You curse was explained to me by you before but my Mother has a possible solution."<p>"She does huh?" Robin-chan smirked evilly and put her hands on her hips. "One that doesn't leave me a girl permanently? Your word on that and I will give in since Batman trusts you to keep your word... and I trust his instincts."<p>"My word," Princess Diana pulled out her royal dignity and Robin-chan nodded taking the flying woman's hand.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"These have to be the oddest flea markets I've ever been to," Akane said again to her sister Nabiki. Akane came in jeans and a sweater, both blue, and carried both a sling bag and a waist pouch. The pouch held a few defensive items. Nabiki was in work coveralls looking like the techie she was, but it was cut a little more stylish and her glasses screamed designer instead of the stereotypical tape bound big frames. "I keep expecting either the police or Batman to bust in at any moment and break it up."<p>"That isn't likely," Nabiki frowned at the fried circuit board she pick up from a table full of them. "This stuff is mostly harmless... or else useless." The board dropped back down to the table as Nabiki let it go in disgust.<p>"Second hand Kord, LexCorp, or WayneTech harmless?" Akane raised an eyebrow at the idea.<p>"Most of it is fried, gutted, or extremely obsolete. A good techie might get something working but very few are good techies," Nabiki picked up another board and paid a few dollars for it after being satisfied by it's condition.<p>"And we come here for what exactly?" Akane frowned at some of the people moving around the large hall area used for this market this time.<p>"I'm a good techie," Nabiki pushed up her glasses and smiled her pearly whites at her sister.<p>"Okay, and remind me why you keep dragging me with you?" Akane rolled her eyes.<p>"To watch my back for one," Nabiki sighed since they always had this conversation at least once a flea market. "You know there are a few goons wandering around these things who look to roll a lone geeky nerd while he's distracted."<p>"You aren't a geeky nerd, Nabs, and you know enough of the family style that you are more of a threat to them than them to you," Akane corrected her sister. "You are right about that nerd stuff though, but you are our nerd."<p>"Gee, thanks," Nabiki replied sarcastically as she picked up an old smoke canister which had been used but could be reloaded. " The other reason is because this is mostly your stuff. I need to know what you want and then figure out if it's feasible with what I can get my hands on."<p>"Right..." Akane sighed in defeat, she could be home training in right now but Nabiki was right.<p>"Nabiki? Nabiki Tendo?" A male voice asked sounding surprised.<p>Nabiki turned in a spin and looked up at the well built black haired, and handsome, older teen in happy shock, "Dick Grayson?"<p>"I thought I saw you over here," Dick smiled which made both girls light headed. "Haven't seen you in a while."<p>"Not since you stopped dating Kasumi a couple of years ago," Nabiki smiled back calming her heart since she had had a crush on him at the time. "This is Akane, my younger sister... I don't think you met her back then since she was so focused on martial arts at the time."<p>"No I don't believe I did," Dick smiled at Akane knowing full well he had met her recently but hiding well. "How is Kasumi?"<p>"She starts pre-med next semester... we didn't have the tuition in soon enough for last semester due to family stuff," Nabiki's smile slipped slightly but she forced it back up. "We're dealing with it now."<p>"Ah, I'm sure," Dick replied not changing his tone, he also knew that too.<p>"So, what brings you to this thing? You a tech freak like Nabiki?" Akane asked trying to shake the odd feeling that she had actually met Dick Grayson before, but recently and not a couple of years prior.<p>"Not really, I'm taking law courses in New York. I'm looking through this junk for some old WayneTech, rumour has it some illegal products have shown up at these things," Dick explained indicating the odd amount of WayneTech strewn out over the tables and blankets nearby. "Most of this stuff they could care less about but a few things are a little embarrassing to Bruce and the company."<p>"WayneTech sent you?" Akane looked confused.<p>"Ignore her, she never paid much attention to the news or society papers," Nabiki rolled her eyes and turned to Akane, "Akane, Dick Grayson is the ward of Bruce Wayne. He has been for years."<p>"He's been like a Father to me since my parents were killed," Dick nodded then started to look around the nearby tables. "I better keep looking for that stuff... say hi to Kasumi for me."<p>"Okay, bye," Nabiki waved as Dick moved on then sighed. "If only Kasumi had kept dating him, they'd be married by now and we wouldn't have had our problems... but that just wasn't in the cards."<p>"Did he train at the Dojo when I wasn't looking?" Akane asked which caused Nabiki to look at her funny. "He moves like a martial artist, and it looks a lot like how Dad moves."<p>"He was a circus acrobat as a child, The Flying Graysons, we saw them once when we were both really young," Nabiki replied never noticing anything wrong with Dick Grayson's moves.<p>"I guess that could explain it," Akane shrugged then looked at an old WWII motorcycle frame. " I think I want a bike... if not for the blindfold I think I liked the feel of riding one the other day."<p>"Now it's a bike!" Nabiki rolled her eyes laughing. "I though you said you were scared on that last ride?"<p>"I was blindfolded," Akane replied miffed.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>AN: I'm rather surprised at the load of negative response to Akane's appearance in this FanFic. Although I might not always write these two together they are the actual central characters in the series, regardless of the single name used to identify the series. I kind of expected people to figure out that Akane would be in Gotham since her whole family was missing from Japan and that Genma left Ranma with a honour pledge to find them. Heck if you hated that you really aren't going to like how I bring in some of the others...<p>As for spelling mistakes, and god knows I make them, I hope you aren't referring to things like colour instead of color and honour instead of honor. If this is the complaint please realize I'm Canadian who was taught proper English spelling and not the spelling that came out of the country south of our boarder.<p>I will not be enforcing the engagement, or the hostile interaction between the two since it isn't need in this fic.<p>Hope you do continue to enjoy this, as I'm still enjoying writing it (I have seven more chapters to input into the computer that I've been writing at work on paper. Life has taken up most of my computer time until recently.)<p>Let's hear it for Aquatranssexual Vigilantes.
