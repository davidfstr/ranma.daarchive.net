</div>The Things We Wish For…<br/>Chapter 1<p>Any and all C+C is appreciated. You can contact me at<p>All of my fics are stored at the following:<p>Larry F's new address at:<br/>.com/florestica/<p>Or R+C books at:<br/>.org<p>And also Angcobra is now storing all of my fics, at<p>Standard Disclaimer: I don't own the rights to any of the Ranma ½ characters. They<br/>belong to Takahashi and whomever she sold the rights to.<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<p>The staccato tapping of Kachiko Tendou's fingertips playing across the wood of the<br/>dining room table filled the air. She sat lackadaisically, slouching slightly, projecting an<br/>air of lassitude that was only contradicted by the half-lidded, and highly suspicious, stare<br/>that was directed towards the two girls seated on the opposite side of the table.<p>Then all four fingers struck the table at once and remained there, signaling an end to the<br/>waiting. A soft whoosh of air was exhaled, and Kachiko's posture straightened slightly.<br/>"So let me get this straight. You somehow got this wish granting ability?" She pointed to<br/>Akane. "You wished your mother hadn't been in a car accident which killed her. A noble<br/>sentiment, I suppose. However, the result of this wish was that I get plucked out of time<br/>and thrown over twenty years into the future, where I get to meet the two of you, who it<br/>just so happens, are my children, one of whom is older than I am now."<p>Akane shifted uncomfortably. "Well, it's a bit simplified, but yes, that's pretty much what<br/>happened."<p>Kasumi nodded her head in agreement.<p>Kachiko leaned over the table and close to the girls. "Tell me something, don't you think<br/>I would be a bit insulted at being told such a stupid lie? I mean, come on, you've not only<br/>got magic, but time travel paradoxes thrown in there as well. What sort of sucker is going<br/>to believe that?"<p>"But it's true!" Kasumi insisted.<p>"Ha!" Kachiko slammed her hand down on the table, not hard enough to crack it, but with<br/>enough force to make it shake. "Oh please, changing some of the furniture around in my<br/>house is not going to make me fall for this pathetic lie. Especially since all of the new<br/>stuff you used is incredibly tacky. Don't you people believe in bright colors? You're as<br/>drab as my parents."<p>"We can prove this is the future, and you're our mother," Akane said.<p>"Sure you can. Why, this place is teeming with signs that it's the future," Kachiko said<br/>dramatically, rising to her feet and entering the kitchen. She gazed in awe at her<br/>surroundings. "Look at all this futuristic equipment. Ohh, a microwave. And what's that?<br/>Why it's a stove. Obviously the design must be good, since it looks exactly like the same<br/>one that's been here since before World War II. And is that… could it be… oh my god!<br/>It's an object that produces cold so that food will last longer. It must be what sci-fi writers<br/>call a refrigerator! I am in the future! Oh my!" Her eyes rolled into the back of her head,<br/>and she gave a soft cry before sagging to the floor.<p>"I don't remember Mother being quite this sarcastic," Kasumi quietly confided to Akane.<p>Kachiko rose back to her feet and returned to the table, staring at the two girls again.<br/>"Tell me something, and you can be honest with me, this is all one of Wacky Wakaba's<br/>little practical jokes, isn't it?"<p>The girls looked at one another. Akane asked, "Wacky Wakaba?"<p>"Oh sure, she's one of my close friends, as if you didn't know," Kachiko said slyly.<br/>"She's always pulling practical jokes like this. Did she tell you about the time she tried<br/>slipping a bomb in my locker, only I saw her plant it, so I switched the lockers? Boy, you<br/>should have seen the look of surprise on her face when she went to get her books and that<br/>baby went off. She was out of the hospital in a week. She's a tough little thing. And then<br/>there was the time we were at the celebration for the baseball team coming in second in<br/>the national championship, and she tried to slip me a powerful aphrodisiac. Only our<br/>drinks got mixed up and she ended up drinking it instead. Boy, was she surprised the next<br/>morning. And sore. She couldn't walk straight for a week. Oh, oh, and best of all, up until<br/>now anyway, there was this time that she sent love letters to this locked up stalker serial<br/>killer and pretended they were from me, so he would get fixated on me. And then she<br/>helped him escape, only he turned on her, so it turned out I had to save her. That girl<br/>always knows how to keep me on my toes." Kachiko nearly doubled over in laughter at<br/>the memories.<p>Akane and Kasumi looked at their mother, aghast. Akane blurted out, "What are you<br/>talking about? Those aren't practical jokes. Those were murder attempts!"<p>Kachiko waved her hand dismissively at them. "Sakura says the same thing, and like I<br/>keep telling her, don't be silly. They're jokes. Wakaba just has a weird sense of humor.<br/>She's a buddy. She's done lots of favors for me. Why, half the guys I dated in high school<br/>were dating her right beforehand. Sometimes only the day before I started going out with<br/>them. She mentions it constantly, and don't think for one second I don't consider myself<br/>in her debt because of it."<p>"I… see," Akane admitted.<p>"So are you two ready to fess up about Wakaba being the mastermind behind this?"<p>"Not at all. We've never even met someone named Wakaba. You really are in the future,"<br/>Kasumi insisted.<p>Kachiko rolled her eyes and rose to her feet. "All right, let's see what I can find to prove<br/>this isn't the future." She looked around until her eyes settled on the television.<br/>Triumphantly she walked over to it and examined the buttons along the strip on the<br/>bottom. "Now we'll see what the television stations of the future are broadcasting."<p>With the flick of a switch the screen came on and a voice loudly proclaimed, "Down here<br/>at Miharu's Used Cars have great deals every day! Low prices mean low interest rates!<br/>Come on down right now and we'll even throw in an extra tire for nothing!"<p>Kachiko looked at the screen in horror. "You mean they still have used car salesmen in<br/>the future? Have you learned nothing? Next thing you'll tell me is you didn't kill all the<br/>lawyers either." She smirked at the girls and changed the channel.<p>"…day we are proud to present for your viewing pleasure, Akira Kurosawa's Seven<br/>Magnificent Samurai."<p>"Of course. Nothing but cutting edge films as well," Kachiko chuckled, and changed it<br/>again.<p>"…and high standing member of the Diet, resigned today over accusations of bribery."<p>*Click*<p>"…taxes were raised yet again."<p>*Click*<p>"… news today of more unrest in the Mid-East."<p>"Oh yes, it's all so very different now in the future," Kachiko said blandly, leaving the<br/>television on.<p>"But we can prove it to you," Kasumi said. "We have your shrine in the living room."<p>Kachiko's eyebrows rose slightly. "A shrine? To me? Now this I have to see." She exited<br/>the room, only to return a minute later. She held up a photo of an attractive woman<br/>somewhere in her late twenties or early thirties, her brown hair done up in a bun. It had<br/>been taken outdoors. She stood next to a tree, dressed in a light gray kimono with her<br/>hands crossed in front of her. The single shaft of sunlight seemed to be focused solely<br/>upon her, giving her an unearthly aura. The corners of her mouth were turned slightly<br/>upward, and her eyes spoke of warmth and caring.<p>Holding the picture before the girls, Kachiko pointed to it. "This is supposed to be me?"<p>Both Akane and Kasumi nodded solemnly at the picture that had rested in its place of<br/>reverence for over a decade. Kasumi said, "It was one of your favorites."<p>Kachiko looked at it again. "BWAHAHAHAHA! You're so lame! Like this could ever be<br/>me."<p>"But it is you!" Kasumi insisted.<p>Barely able to reign in her laughter, Kachiko got out, "Yeah, right. As if I'd ever pose like<br/>this for a photo. Whoever you got to dress up like that didn't know me at all. Wakaba<br/>should have known better that to try and pass this ringer off as me."<p>"What do you mean?" Akane asked.<p>"I hate kimonos," Kachiko explained. "They're tight and confining. I never wear them<br/>voluntarily, and would never let myself be photographed in one. And then there's this hair<br/>in the picture. Aside from the fact it looks completely lame, it just so happens that I hate<br/>permed hair."<p>"But you always wore it that way," Kasumi said.<p>Kachiko fingered her locks. "Nope, this is the way I like it. I'd rather be bald than have a<br/>perm. This easier to manage and makes me look cute." She considered Kasumi for a<br/>moment. "You know, you'd probably look better with shorter hair, like me and Akane, or<br/>whatever her real name is. Not that you look bad, just that you'd go from being real cute<br/>to real hot. You got kind of a round face, like me, so it would suit you better. Trust me on<br/>this." Kachiko returned her attention to the photo. "But all of that is just circumstantial<br/>evidence. What's really the most damning detail that shows this is a fake is that smile."<p>"What's wrong with Mom's, I mean your, smile?" Akane asked.<p>Kachiko rolled her eyes. "It's sooo not me. I mean, this woman looks like it's taking an<br/>effort to even get her lips pointed upward. Now when I smile, it's something the whole<br/>world can see. Watch." She held the photo side-by-side with her head, then gave a huge<br/>toothy grin that nearly took up half her face.<p>Kasumi said, "You look better with a soft smile."<p>"You look like a demented hyena," Akane agreed.<p>Kachiko scowled at the two girls, then held the photo in front of her. "I'm insulted at the<br/>insinuation that I could ever look like this. You know what the woman in this picture<br/>cries out so hard that it makes my eyes tear? Frumpiness. She's an old frump that<br/>probably hasn't had a fun day in her whole life. I can easily believe she's some housewife<br/>with three kids. She looks tired, boring, and is right on the verge of lapsing into a coma."<p>Kasumi was aghast. "How dare you say such things about my mother, er, Mother." The<br/>shock drained out of her as she realized the quandary that was present. She looked<br/>helplessly at Akane, who just shrugged her shoulders in response.<p>Tossing the photo on the table so it landed in front of them, Kachiko said, "You know<br/>something? If I was to turn into someone as dull as this, I would prefer being dead. Better<br/>that than some living hell as a mindless automaton chained to a boring husband and<br/>obnoxious kids for the rest of her dreary existence."<p>"That was not the way things were! You were happy!" Kasumi cried out.<p>Akane was shocked at seeing her sister's emotional outburst. Certainly, Akane was also<br/>disturbed at their mother's commentary on what she theorized life had been like, even if<br/>this version of Kachiko Tendou hadn't lived through those years, but to see the usually<br/>placid Kasumi on the verge of anger was almost as disturbing as the idea that the girl<br/>before them was in reality their mother.<p>Kachiko whistled. "You're a good actress. I can almost believe you really think I'm your<br/>mother. I—" Her head darted in the direction of the television.<p>"What—" was all Akane got out before Kachiko made a hushing motion with her hand.<p>"I heard something." The time lost girl went over to the television and turned it up.<p>The news reporter continued. "Many gathered in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the<br/>anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union. Crowds turned out in the hundreds of<br/>thousands—"<p>Visibly disturbed, Kachiko changed the channel.<p>"—well, Mr. Morisoto, this so-called design flaw with the Shinohara OS is as much a<br/>media sensation as the so-called Y2K bug that was supposed to cause the end of the<br/>world as we knew it. But it looks to me like we made it well past the year two thousand<br/>without the collapse of civilization. What you have yet to accept are that labors are the<br/>way of the future, and this interface system is the first step towards that futur—"<p>She changed the channel again.<p>"—since the unexpected cancellation of the popular series back in two thousand and one.<br/>People have been writing in and demanding that it return—"<p>Kachiko turned the television off. She shot the two girls an angry glare. "Exactly how did<br/>you manage to override the signal and show those to me?"<p>Shaking her head, Akane said, "We didn't. Those are really the television programs that<br/>are on right now. You're in the future."<p>For a moment, Akane was worried the girl might hit her, then Kachiko's eyes alighted on<br/>something that grabbed her complete attention. "Ah ha! An oversight on your part." She<br/>walked over to a side table and picked up a folded over newspaper. "Let's check out the<br/>date on this little thing." She unfolded the paper and came to the front page. Her eyes<br/>scanned over it. A second later, the paper made a crinkling sound as it was wadded into a<br/>very small ball and hurled into the garbage can with considerable force. "It's easy to make<br/>fake newspapers. I've seen them before. It's be a lot easier to make than the television<br/>trick."<p>"Mother," Kasumi said softly.<p>"Enough."<p>The way it was stated, in such a firm yet soft manner, reminded Kasumi of the way the<br/>woman who had raised her would have issued the command. Instinctively, the rest of<br/>what she had been planning to say died on her tongue.<p>Kachiko walked over to a nearby window and stared out. She began looking at the sights<br/>that were afforded by the view. Aloud, she calmly said, "Looks like you got someone to<br/>fix up the fence and build a koi pond out back. That's nice. I always liked the idea of a<br/>pond; less grass for me to cut. I have to hand it to you, this is one elaborate hoax. The<br/>Matsui residence looks the same as always. So do the Tanakas. And as for the<br/>Morimotos…"<p>Akane and Kasumi watched as the girl's lips pursed slightly and one of the muscles on<br/>the side of her face began twitching. "Okay. Completely changing a house. That can be<br/>done, too."<p>"Now you're being unrealistic," Akane said.<p>"So says the girl that claims she got a wish from a genie and brought her dead mother<br/>back from the past." Kachiko snorted. "This is ridiculous. I'm out of here."<p>"Where are you going?" Kasumi's voice was tinged with panic.<p>"Out where I can find someone to set me straight." There wasn't the faintest hint of doubt<br/>in Kachiko's voice. If anything, it sounded tired. She turned sharply on her heel and<br/>headed to the front door.<p>"Do you suppose you could untie us first?" Akane asked.<p>Pausing, Kachiko looked to where she had tied the girls together, back-to-back. Upon<br/>entering the house, and believing the intruders to be thieves, she had managed to grab<br/>some rope that had been conveniently lying around and spun it around Akane, whom<br/>Kachiko had sensed was the more physically capable of the pair, and immobilized her. It<br/>was a simple matter to quickly do the same to the completely untrained Kasumi. Once<br/>they were incapacitated, they had revealed their fraudulent tale to her, which eventually<br/>led to her losing her temper at the inexplicably elaborate scheme.<p>"No, I don't think so. You're staying here. Once I get to the bottom of this, I'm going to<br/>make you two apologize for trying to drive me nuts. See you later." Kachiko headed out<br/>of the room and into the hall. A moment later she opened the front door, closed it behind<br/>her, and entered the world beyond.<p>The time-lost girl's footsteps were confident as she hurried in a familiar direction. She<br/>knew damn well where she had to go to get to the bottom of matters. Sakura was the one<br/>person in the world Kachiko would trust with her life, and more importantly, she had no<br/>tolerance for Wakaba's pranks. The idea that she would was as alien as Kachiko giving<br/>up martial arts. It would be a simple matter to visit the best friend she ever had and hear<br/>from her mouth how this whole thing was an elaborate hoax and boy would Wakaba pay<br/>for going way over the bounds this time. Bombs and aphrodisiacs were one thing; playing<br/>with a poor young girl's mind was quite another.<p>As Kachiko made her way through Nerima, the unsettled feeling that had come into being<br/>since watching the fake television programs, grew to ungodly proportions. The<br/>neighborhood was not quite right, like the Tanaka's house. While the overall layout to the<br/>area was the same, it was in the smaller details where the discrepancies became obvious.<br/>Houses weren't quite the way she remembered them. They had different colors or altered<br/>exteriors. Cars looked different, as though their basic designs had changed overnight.<br/>Everyone's clothing seems slightly off as well, especially among the teenagers. While<br/>there were familiar school uniforms and business suits, many of the more casual styles<br/>had been altered almost to the degree where it felt like she was walking through a foreign<br/>country. Why, some girls were even wearing clothing that bared their mid-riffs, and no<br/>one even seemed to take notice.<p>"Maybe it was some sort of post-hypnotic suggestion," Kachiko murmured to herself.<br/>Time travel was impossible. Those two girls at her house were not her non-existent<br/>daughters. She was a virgin. With one notable exception, virgins didn't have children,<br/>and certainly not three grown offspring. It was a stupid joke that Wakaba was really going<br/>to be given hell for.<p>With each block traveled, with each person passed, the uneasy feeling in Kachiko<br/>stomach grew until it felt like she would expel the contents of her stomach over the<br/>sidewalk. Panic, an emotion she rarely experienced, ate away at the edges of her<br/>controlled demeanor. She wanted to grab the people that passed by and order them to start<br/>acting normally, but she fended off such irrational thoughts with the assurance that<br/>Sakura could make it all better. Sakura made everything better. She had a way of<br/>explaining things that could make complete chaos seem, if not like order, at least<br/>understandable.<p>Not a moment too soon in her opinion, Kachiko arrived at her destination. She stood<br/>outside the small walkway to a familiar two story structure that was on the small side.<br/>Sakura lived with her parents, older sister, and her sister's husband and child. It was<br/>terribly crowded, which was one of the reasons Sakura visited the Tendou residence so<br/>often; it was the only place were she could get some space of her own. After this little<br/>escapade, Kachiko was going to recommend Sakura move in for at least a week until<br/>everything felt like normal.<p>Ten steps up the walk, the same ten steps it had always taken, and Kachiko found herself<br/>standing next to the entryway of the house. Finger shaking with uncharacteristic<br/>nervousness, she pressed the familiar red button for the doorbell (or was it a different<br/>shade of red?) and heard a ringing from inside. Already her spirit started to ease at the<br/>well-known sensations.<p>"Coming," a feminine voice from inside announced. A handful of seconds later, the door<br/>opened to reveal an average-looking woman, a bit on the heavy side, in her late thirties,<br/>and with a long mane of black hair that appeared slightly frazzled. Automatically she<br/>said, "Greetings—" and stopped as her eyes focused on the young woman standing<br/>outside on the porch. Her eyes widened and she drew back in horror for a moment as she<br/>breathed out, "Kachi."<p>Kachiko's mouth went dry. No words could come out, no matter how she tried to force<br/>them. Everything she had known, everything she had wanted to believe contrary to the<br/>evidence presented to her, was lost in a second and she understood the horrifying truth.<p>Just as quickly the woman composed herself, drawing up to her full height before<br/>bowing. "I'm sorry. Please forgive me. You remind me of someone I knew from a long<br/>time ago." She rose from her bow and looked her visitor over more closely. "Tell me, is<br/>your last name Tendou?"<p>Automatically, Kachiko managed to say, "Yes."<p>A look of profound relief passed over the woman's features. "That explains it. You're one<br/>of Kachi's daughters, aren't you?"<p>Despite feeling her world knocked out from under her feet, Kachiko's mind went from<br/>being completely dazed to processing information. In a far off voice, her mind managed<br/>to form a response using what knowledge it had gathered in the last few hours. "Yes,<br/>Akane. Akane Tendou."<p>The woman bowed again. "It's an honor to meet you. What brings you here, might I ask?"<p>Kachiko was still in a daze of sorts. It took a moment to come up with an answer. "You<br/>are Sakura Daisho?"<p>"It's Ogawa now," Sakura informed her. "I've been married for some time. No one's<br/>called me by my maiden name for years."<p>Years. "You knew Kachiko Tendou well, didn't you?"<p>A pained look crossed Sakura's features. She shifted uncomfortably. "Why yes, we were<br/>best friends when we went to high school. But we… fell out of touch over the years. I<br/>doubt if you were born the last time we saw one another. I read about her death in the<br/>paper."<p>"You know she's dead?" Kachiko asked, more bile rising to her throat.<p>Sakura nodded. "It was a tragedy. Even though we'd had a falling out, it still broke my<br/>heart." A sniffle escaped the older woman.<p>The way Sakura, even one whose image was distorted by the years, sniffled caught<br/>Kachiko's attention. "You and I… I mean you and my mother had a falling out? But you<br/>were best friends."<p>Sakura gave the younger girl a sad stare. Tears were starting to form in her eyes. "Ah, my<br/>dear. I'm afraid you'll discover that even the greatest of friendships can mean nothing<br/>when a man becomes involved in the situation."<p>"Oh." Even Kachiko's tumultuous mind didn't need more information to figure out the<br/>reason of why their friendship had fallen apart.<p>"Events reached their peak late in our senior year. We exchanged harsh words. Your<br/>mother had quite the tongue on her. Things degenerated from there until we barely spoke<br/>to one another. Then we stopped talking altogether." She dabbed at her eyes with a<br/>handkerchief. "I just wished I could have made up with her before she passed on. It's just,<br/>I thought there was always enough time to do it later, so I never got around to it. And now<br/>it's too late."<p>Seeing her friend in such pain served to kick Kachiko's senses back into full working<br/>order. Whatever the physical differences between the Sakura of Kachiko's yesterday and<br/>the woman before her now became meaningless. Kachiko soothed, "I know for a fact she<br/>forgave any disagreements you two had before she died. She… she could never hold<br/>anything against someone who was her best friend. Not for long. She… had so few<br/>friends. I know she valued your friendship most of all."<p>Sakura appeared buoyed by the hope. "I… I'm sorry. This has all caught me off guard.<br/>You're certain she forgave me?"<p>"As sure as I'm standing here now," Kachiko assured her.<p>Sakura's obvious attempts to stem the flow of tears were to no avail. "I'm sorry. I didn't<br/>realize how much this bothered me. But now, when I thought forgiveness would never<br/>come…" She began crying some more.<p>Automatically Kachiko reached forward and hugged Sakura, the years that stood between<br/>them melting away. Never had she seen her best friend cry, especially not like this. Such<br/>guilt, no matter the cause, pained Kachiko to see, and she did her best to remove it and<br/>comfort the woman.<p>After several minutes, Sakura regained some measure of her composure. "Forgive me for<br/>making such a spectacle of myself."<p>"Ah, don't worry about," Kachiko waved her hand dismissively.<p>The response surprised Sakura. "You know, you sound exactly like your mother when<br/>you do that. She used to wave her hand and gave that same reply to everything she<br/>thought was unimportant."<p>"I, ah, take after her a lot." Kachiko shifted uncomfortably.<p>A soft gasp escaped Sakura's lips. "Where are my manners? Forgive me. I've been<br/>keeping you out here on the porch and crying on you all this time and I still don't know<br/>what brought you here."<p>"My feet," Kachiko joked.<p>"Oh dear, you seem to have inherited your mother's pitiful sense of humor as well."<p>"Hey! I got a great sense of humor."<p>A high pitched laugh escaped Sakura's lips. "She used to say that exact same thing<br/>whenever I mentioned that shortcoming." Significantly more cheerful, she said, "Now,<br/>what brings you here?"<p>Kachiko shifted uncomfortably. She wanted to run, but needed to stay. Not just to be in<br/>the presence of someone familiar, but because she needed to know everything that had<br/>happened during her absent years. It would be only one piece of the puzzle, but a vital<br/>one. "Sak… I mean Mrs. Ogawa. Could you tell me about my mother?"<p>The question made Sakura nod. "Now I understand."<p>That caught Kachiko off guard. "You do? How?"<p>The older woman smiled serenely. "She died when you were very young, and you want to<br/>know more about her, don't you?"<p>Not one to pass up such an obvious opportunity, Kachiko said, "Yes. That's it. Definitely.<br/>I'd like to know everything about her. Oh, just one thing. Do you remember her<br/>disappearing for a brief while back in the summer when she was seventeen?"<p>Sakura paused in thought. "Not that I can remember, and that was long before we started<br/>having problems. We saw each other practically ever day. Why do you ask?"<p>Thinking fast enough that it surprised even her, Kachiko explained, "Someone said she<br/>might have taken a trip during that time, but I guess they were wrong."<p>Not completely certain what to make of the that, Sakura simply replied, "Why don't we<br/>go inside? It'll be more comfortable and I can serve us some tea."<p>"I'll take mine with some lemon and a hit of sake."<p>A haunted expression passed ever so quickly across Sakura's features. Then the soft<br/>smile returned and she laughed. "Forgive me, but you are exactly like your mother. She<br/>wouldn't willingly drink it any other way either."<p>"Errr, right."<p>Sakura ushered Kachiko inside. As they entered surroundings that were familiar yet<br/>strangely alien to the younger girl, an errant thought occurred to Kachiko. "What<br/>happened to the guy you two fought over?"<p>"I married him, so it wasn't all for nothing," Sakura admitted, blushing heavily.<p>Intrigued at the sort of man who could come between two such close friends -and at how<br/>he could have possibly picked Sakura over someone as vibrant and vivacious as Kachiko<br/>herself- the younger girl asked, "Is he around?"<p>"No, he's at work. But I have a pictures of him. Here's one. You can see him for<br/>yourself." Sakura picked up a framed photograph that had been sitting on a stand next to<br/>the kitchen.<p>Kachiko took one look at it and recoiled. "You two actually fought over him?"<p>"Yes," Sakura sighed, holding the photo to her bosom.<p>"Thanks for doing me a favor and winning," Kachiko murmured in disbelief.<p>"What was that?" Sakura asked.<p>"I can tell by the picture he has a nice personality," Kachiko blurted out. "Why don't we<br/>go back to the topic of my mother?"<p>"Of course." The older woman took one last longing gaze at the photo before setting it<br/>down and moving to a couch so the duo could speak. Within moments they were talking<br/>like old friends, a fact Sakura found oddly comforting, despite the awkwardness of the<br/>situation.<p>They remained in conversation until well after the sun disappeared below the horizon.<p>Xxxxxxxxxxxxx<p>Nabiki looked at her two sisters and, for once, didn't know what to make of the situation.<br/>"You're absolutely certain this woman was our mother? It wasn't some impostor or evil<br/>duplicate from a mirror or an animate statue that looks like her or some spirit possessing<br/>her body?"<p>Akane snapped, "It's not like I had any time to take a DNA test or something! I made the<br/>wish, and she jumped us almost as soon as she came in."<p>Kasumi shrugged. "I'm uncertain too. I know she's young, but I can't see Mother being<br/>so hostile to strangers in her house. And she moved so fast that even Akane couldn't do<br/>anything before she was tied up. Mother didn't know any martial arts. Only Father did."<p>"Unless she stopped practicing after she got pregnant or something. The dojo is actually<br/>from her side of the family, and she was an only child," Nabiki pointed out. "How about<br/>looking up some old photos of her and see if they match?"<p>Kasumi placed her finger to her chin in thought. "Actually, now that I think about it, I<br/>don't recall seeing any pictures of mother when she was young. The only ones I can<br/>remember are from after she and Father were married."<p>"That's odd," Akane said.<p>"Yes. Now that I think about it, you're right. I wonder why that is." Nabiki began to<br/>ponder the dilemma, then realized there were important matters at hand. "But why did she<br/>come back so young?"<p>"I didn't wish for that," Akane assured her. "I only wished she hadn't died in a car<br/>accident and was here with us today."<p>"What precisely did you wish for? I mean the exact phrasing?" Nabiki asked.<p>Hand to her temple in thought, Akane reluctantly admitted, "I'm not so sure I remember<br/>the exact wording. A lot's happened since then, and I was in a hurry. I did word it<br/>carefully though so she didn't end up dying later on from something else. I'm pretty sure I<br/>said I wished she hadn't been in a car accident and was alive today and with us."<p>"That sounds about right." Kasumi continued wringing her hands in concern.<p>Nabiki held up her own hands in surrender. "Maybe Daddy can shed some light on it.<br/>Right now what I want to know is where she is. Where would she go?"<p>"How should I know?" Akane snapped.<p>Nabiki said, "You wished for her back. Maybe there's some sort of link between you."<p>"There is. She's my mother, and I'm her daughter. It's the same link you have."<p>Kasumi made her way between the two and spoke in soothing tones. "Now everyone<br/>needs to settle down." Kasumi forced her own worries under control for the sake of her<br/>sisters. Her words had the desired effect as both Nabiki and Akane cooled off.<p>Nabiki was about to say something else when the sound of the front door opening reached<br/>their ears. Not hearing anyone announce their arrival, all three girls remained in the living<br/>room waiting for the visitor to approach them.<p>The sound of footsteps informed them they would not have to wait long. Within seconds,<br/>Nabiki laid her eyes upon her 'mother' for the first time in over ten years. Despite the<br/>difference between memory and the girl standing before her, the resemblance between<br/>Kachiko and her daughters, especially Akane, was too striking to miss. Despite the usual<br/>control she had over her emotions, Nabiki felt a sort of happiness slip through as she said,<br/>"Hello, Mother."<p>Kachiko let out a tired sigh. "You must be the middle one Akane and Kasumi were telling<br/>me about. Nakiki."<p>"Nabiki, actually," she corrected.<p>"Whatever. Someone else must have picked that stupid name." Kachiko plopped down<br/>and sat cross-legged on the floor, staring off into space.<p>Akane and Kasumi approached her hopefully. Akane was the first to speak. "Um, I don't<br/>mean to be nosy, but where did you go?"<p>Staying in her seated position, Kachiko said in a quiet voice, "To see a friend. Now I<br/>know you guys were telling the truth. I really am over twenty years in the future.<br/>Somehow your wish pulled me out from my present and to here." She closed her eyes and<br/>seemed to tremble slightly. "Do you know what this means?"<p>Akane laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Yes. You're trapped in a time and place<br/>not of your own making. Everything you knew is changed or disappeared altogether.<br/>Everyone you knew has gone on without you, and you're just a memory to them. In a lot<br/>of ways, it's like you're alone. The entire world you grew up on is gone for good. I know<br/>it's terribly frightening, but I promise you we'll be with you every step of the way and<br/>help do whatever it takes to put you at ease."<p>Softly, still with her eyes closed and trembling, Kachiko said, "Who cares about all that?"<p>"What?" Akane said.<p>Suddenly Kachiko shot to her feet, knocking Akane over. Pumping her fist to the sky, the<br/>time-lost girl shouted, "Don't you get it? I cheated death! BWHAHAHAHA!"<p>The trio of girls cringed and drew back.<p>A cold aura of power glowed around Kachiko. In delirious glee she shouted, "I have a<br/>second chance at everything! I mean, getting cut down while I was still relatively in the<br/>prime of my life? Talk about being cheated. And to have it happen to someone as nice,<br/>cute, and intelligent as me? I tell you, when something like that happens, it makes you<br/>think there isn't such a thing as justice in this world. And then there was how pitiful my<br/>life was before I died. Sakura told me some of the stupid things I did after I ended up in a<br/>car accident and damaged my leg so badly I could barely perform martial arts anymore. I<br/>can't believe I let my parents convince me since I was shot as a martial artist I needed to<br/>give up the art, settle down, and marry young so someone could carry on the dojo. And<br/>having several children before I was twenty-five? Why, it's like I was given a death<br/>sentence before I was dead."<p>"Excuse me, but we are those children, you know!" Akane shouted. Nabiki was scowling<br/>at the raving woman as well, while Kasumi looked truly disturbed at her mother's<br/>declarations.<p>Kachiko didn't hear a word. She yelled to the sky, "This time, I'm really going to do<br/>things right! None of this marrying young, having kids, or crossing streets! I'm going to<br/>have fun, fun, fun until I keel over from exhaustion, and then I'm really going to cut<br/>loose! And it begins now!"<p>Without giving the astonished girls a second glance, Kachiko headed directly for the<br/>refrigerator and began rummaging through it. Within seconds she pulled out a large bottle<br/>of sake and removed the top.<p>Kasumi waved her hands and tried getting her mother's attention. "Excuse me, but that's<br/>father and Mr. Saotome's sake. I don't think it's really proper to…"<p>Placing the bottle to her lips, Kachiko tilted her head back and proceeded to drink. The<br/>bottle never left her lips as she guzzled the liquid down in loud gulps that filled the<br/>otherwise shocked silent room. The alcohol was gone as quickly as if it had been poured<br/>down a drain.<p>"Ah! Now that's the way to start things off!" Kachiko tossed the bottle against a wall,<br/>shattering the glass container and creating a small collection of shards in that area of the<br/>room.<p>"I'll clean that up," Kasumi said in a daze as she left the room to grab a broom and dust<br/>pan.<p>"What's all this racket?" A new voice, carrying an authoritative tone, demanded from the<br/>doorway leading to the living room.<p>Everyone turned to see Soun Tendou looking crossly upon the scene. His anger was short-<br/>lived as his eyes fell upon a young woman again for the first time. He blinked once for<br/>Disbelief. A second time for Denial. A third for Acceptance.<p>He was across the room in a flash, embracing the impossible dream. "Oh, my love, I've<br/>missed you so much!" he wept.<p>So consumed was his mind in being given his heart's deepest desire, that it failed to<br/>notice the girl stiffen under his grasp. Lost in turmoil, it failed to register the tightening of<br/>muscles in response to his familiar grip. And though his mind was preoccupied, his body<br/>still responded to the savage uppercut dealt to it by flying up into the air like a missile,<br/>through the second floor, through the roof, and across a distance well out of sight of the<br/>residents of the house.<p>"What the hell was that?" Kachiko huffed out, her fist still coiled and prepared to lash<br/>out at anything else that might try to jump her.<p>In a tired voice, Nabiki said, "That, was your husband and father of your children: Soun<br/>Tendou."<p>Kachiko stomped her foot in anger and pointed up to the hole in the ceiling. "Don't be<br/>stupid! There's no way I'd ever marry an old fossil like that! And he's a pervert, too! He<br/>ran right in here and groped me! I feel like I need a bath! Ewwww!"<p>Patience wearing thin, Nabiki said, "He was somewhat younger when you were married,<br/>and since he's your husband, he's done a lot of more intimate things with you- myself,<br/>Kasumi, and Akane being proof positive of that."<p>"The hell he has!" Kachiko raged. "I'm as virgin as pristine snow, and intend to remain<br/>that way until I find the right guy. If that geriatric lech even looks at me funny, I'll rip off<br/>his !#$ balls and feed them to the fish out in back."<p>Finished cleaning up the broken glass, Kasumi looked worriedly at her mother. "Oh dear.<br/>Does this mean I should look up the number of a marriage counselor for you and Father?"<p>Kachiko ominously intoned, "It means you'd better look up the number of a morgue if he<br/>tries to lay one more perverted finger on me again."<p>"What's all this racket about?" A different voice asked from the doorway where Soun had<br/>entered only minutes before.<p>Kachiko was about to bellow out a general condemnation about clobbering the next<br/>pervert that dared to enter the room when her eyes alighted on the speaker and the words<br/>floated out of her mind and into the void beyond.<p>Upon hearing the shouting, Ranma had entered the room fully expecting the typical scene<br/>of carnage and confusion. Instead he found himself looking at Akane, who had<br/>mysteriously gained narrower hips. It took him a second to look more closely at the face<br/>and realize, "Hey, you aren't Akane."<p>Kachiko sauntered forward. "Damn straight I'm not. My name is Kachiko, but I insist you<br/>call me Kachi." She stood next to Ranma and looked deeply into his eyes. "And what's<br/>your name?"<p>Confronted with someone who looked so much Akane, but was looking at him in a way<br/>Akane definitely did not, confused him enough that he stumbled over his words as he<br/>spoke. "I'm, ah, Ranma Saotome."<p>"And what brings you here?" Kachiko asked. "Besides your feet," she added.<p>"I, ah, live here." It was almost said as a question.<p>Kachiko all but purred, "Well, well, well. It looks like there's hope for the future yet."<p>Collecting some of his senses, Ranma got out, "What's that supposed to me-umph!" The<br/>rest of his words were smothered as Kachiko's lips pressed against his.<p>Ranma's eyes widened in shock at the move. Kasumi covered her mouth in surprise while<br/>Nabiki merely shook her head.<p>Akane had the most profound response as she shouted, "Ranma! How dare you kiss my<br/>mother like that!"<p>Ranma darted his lips away from Kachiko's and gestured wildly with his hands while<br/>shouting, "I did not kiss her! She kissed m… did you say she's your mother?"<p>"Actually, I didn't kiss anyone. I jus' lost my balance since the room's spinning so<br/>much," Kachiko explained as she slid down Ranma and all but pooled onto the floor at<br/>his feet. "I feel dizzy and nauseous. I think I'm suffering from the side effects of time<br/>travel."<p>"You're suffering from the side effects of pounding down a whole bottle of sake," Nabiki<br/>stated coolly.<p>Kachiko snorted, "Ha! I'll have you know I've drank entire bottles of sake before and<br/>been perfectly fine. Observe." The young girl rose effortlessly to her feet and stood as<br/>rigidly as a tree.<p>Nabiki walked over and tapped a single finger against her mother's chest. Kachiko<br/>proceeded to fall over and land with a thud, just like a tree that had been chopped down.<br/>"Didn't drink any of them all at once, did you?" she said to the girl on the floor.<p>"A minor detail that escaped my notish," Kachiko slurred. "Ranma, help me to my bed,<br/>would you?"<p>Seeing what terrible shape the girl was in, Ranma did as he was requested by picking her<br/>up in his arms. "Um, which bed are you sleeping in?"<p>"Yours will do," she said groggily.<p>"And where do I sleep?"<p>"Don't be shilly. It's your bed. You'll be sleeping in it too,"<p>"She'll be sleeping in my room," Akane said in no uncertain terms. "I'm responsible for<br/>her being here, so it's the least I can do until we get things sorted out."<p>In a completely bewildered voice, Ranma asked, "Um, exactly what is going on here?" as<br/>the girl in his arms began singing, "I'm not very dead; I'm just very happy," extremely off<br/>key.<p>Akane shook her head at the scene. "First, we put her to bed, then we'll get to the<br/>explanations. It's going to be a long and confusing one this time, even for around here."<p>Ranma groaned in surrender.<p>Xxxxxxxxxxxxx<p>Well, got this one finished. This was a transition chapter, and subsequently I wasn't able<br/>to get into the flow I really wanted to with it. But it was necessary since I had to get some<br/>groundwork put down and the way paved for future chapters. Hopefully, the next chapter<br/>will be more in line with the more humorous style of storytelling I really want to go for in<br/>this series as Kachi begins her first steps in actually interacting with the fun loving lot of<br/>people around her, and we get to see their reaction to her.<p>Special thanks to lots of people too numerous to name.
