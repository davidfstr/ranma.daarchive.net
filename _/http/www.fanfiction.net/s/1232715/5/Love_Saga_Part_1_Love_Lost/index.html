</div>Disclaimer: I do not own these characters nor do I claim too, this is a simple fan based homage. Their creators and the companies they work for and with own the characters and all that pertains to them. (I.E. Rumiko Takahashi) This is just fans of the show expressing their love for it for fun, no profit is involved or expected thank you.<p>Author's Notes: This is the final chapter for this prologue. After the last chapter being so dark this one will be less so. Oh its going to have its angsty moments that's for sure. I also want to say that this one will show that Ranma is not so blameless is the destruction of his and Akane's marriage. On reason for the title of this fic, this is a direct sequel to the first chapter in that it focuses on Ranma. I wanted the first and last chapters to be like bookends. Also when Ranma is talking the words are purposely misspelled to show his bad use of language. There will also be a final chapter after this where I will discuss some of my view on the characters involved such as my views on Akane. And this will have an interlude leading up to the main story.<p>Love Lost 2<p>Two days, two days I've been walking around Tokyo, I was so ready to go out and start a new life thought Ranma. "HA" laughs Ranma, "Took about an hour ta realize I don't know to do nothing." "No skills 'cept martial arts, no real education, . . . no Akane" he finishes with a mumble. With a thoughtful frown crossing his face "maybe I could go back." His face then curls up in disgust "no way, that ain't happnen." "But what can I do" despair almost creeping into his voice. "GRUMBLE" blush covering his cheeks Ranma looks around embarrassed. With a pat to his stomach he says "I know, I know got ta find some food."<p>Taking a glance at his surroundings, a darkened street somewhere in residential Tokyo neighborhood. "It's not Nerima that's good enough for now." "Jeez no lights in any of these buildings, while pops would like that, I ain't gonna go back to stealin." Eyes squinting down the road "well looks like some bodies home," he say's, seeing a light down the way. "Might as well see if anybody needs any help with somethin, maybe get some grub."<p>With that he starts off at a trot only to slow, face screwing up in confusion. "What the," he mumbles "not a shop or a restaurant, maybe some kinda temple, oh well doesn't hurt ta see if I can get some grub."<p>Walking up a flight of stairs only to stop and squint at a sign "ugh, English, man makes me wish I studied it more in high school." Trying the door only to find it open. "Huh" he mutters, "it's still open, cool." Peeking inside and looking around he sees two rows of benches with an aisle in between them. Stained glass windows line the walls and a raised platform stands across from him. "I know what this is, one of those western churches" he says as he walks inside a ways. "That's right my son" say's a voice behind him causing Ranma jump up and cling to one of two chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.<p>Breath coming in gasps and with wide eyes a murmured "hungrier than I thought not payen attention" comes from Ranma as he looks back toward the doors. And sees an elderly Japanese man with coat and hat on. Flipping back to the ground as the man begins by saying "sorry to shock you young man I was just about to lock up but is there something I can help you with."<p>Embarrassed Ranma starts to walk out "na that's okay ah . . .sensei?"<p>"Sensei is fine young man" the older man replies with a chuckle.<p>I'll get out of your way sensei" Ranma Replies.<p>"GRUMBLE," mutters Ranma's stomach causing him to blush once more, an embarrassed Ranma mutters a muted chuckle.<p>"Hold on a moment young man would you like a cup of tea and some cookies."<p>"I wouldn't want to impose, your leaven an all."<p>Smiling at Ranma sensei responds "that's okay son you look like you could use someone to talk too almost as much as you could use some food."<p>"If your sure it's okay sensei" begins Ranma.<p>"No problem boy come on into my office."<p>Through a side door near the platform they walk into a small dark office. Bright light flares from a lamp on a heavy desk that sits by a window, temporarily blinding Ranma. "Sorry about that been meaning to put a lower watt bulb in this lamp."<p>"It's okay" replies Ranma as he rubs his eyes with the back of his hand.<p>"Have a seat son," says Sensei pointing to a seat across from him, as he walks over to a small side table with a hot plate and a mini-fridge standing next to it. As he puts the water to boil Ranma looks around the room bookshelves line one wall with big heavy leather bound books.<p>"So your traveling young man" sensei states turning on the hot plate with one hand while pointing with the other to Ranma's heavy pack that sits on the floor by his chair.<p>"Uh not exactly, ya see my wife just divorced me and kicked me out."<p>"That's terrible young man divorce is not something that people in my profession like to hear about happening."<p>"Yah, it's no fun ta go through too I'll tell you, ya see my and Akane's, uh that's my wif... I mean my ex-wife's name." "Anyway our pops thought it up as a way of, get this, Uniting the Schools." "Fe, we fought more than anything, and now my mom won't stop blaming herself for my marriage failing always crying and stuff." "And Akane always got so mad yelling and screaming at me. I mean sensei I'm in a mall waiting for her to come out of a shop she's been in there for like maybe an hour. So I'm sitting there waiting, board outta my mind when this girl comes up and sits on the bench next to me all close so I scoot over away from her then she moves closer again and starts talking about how I look like a model and stuff. I just try ta ignore her and stuff but just then Akane comes outta nowhere and starts yelling and hitting me like always yellin about how I couldn't wait to go off and flirt. What's up with that, so I tell her stop bein so stupid, so she pounds me and runs off in a huff and tells everybody how she caught me tryin ta cheat on her."<p>"Hold on a minute son, take a breath. Here I found a leftover sandwich in the mini fridge if you want it."<p>"Yah thanks sir" Ranma replies.<p>"Okay now some questions first, you mentioned how you and Akane were to unite the schools what do you mean?"<p>"Oh yeah, my and her family practice anything goes martial arts."<p>"And your marriage together was to unite your school." At Ranma's nod sensei continued, "okay I understand that as for the problem with your mother. I'm not sure without talking to her what her problem could be but maybe if you talk to her and reassure her that it isn't her fault, maybe convince her to talk too someone for help, anyway just continue reassure her, talk to her. As for the incident at the mall you mentioned you mean to say that Akane regularly beat you?"<p>"Ah it ain't all that sensei we're both martial artist, though she ain't much of one."<p>With a sigh, the older man shakes head "anyway we'll talk about this more in a minute. As for the incident, well it seems, just from hearing your side of it mind you, that Akane was jealous of that woman flirting with you."<p>"Flirting, what are you talking about sir?"<p>Confused expression on his face sensei responds, "Ranma I can tell just from your story that the woman was hitting on you."<p>An even more confused expression crosses Ranma's face "she was? You sure sir."<p>"It seems so to me young man, and calling Akane stupid may not be the best of ideas you know.<p>"yea s'just she gets me so mad sir."<p>"Let's talk some more young man, here's your tea, oh and I found another sandwich. I also just realize something young man I don't now you name."<p>"Sorry sir it's Ranma, Ranma Saotome."<p>*****************As the Night Passes********************<p>"That's some life young man."<p>"Yah, try being the one to live it."<p>*********<p>"So sensei, what your say'in is this Jesus guy was the Son of God, and their is only one God also. So anyway this Jesus guy died for the stuff I did wrong? And that to get to heaven I just gotta except that he was the son God and that he died "in the Flesh" as you put it and like accept him "into my heart" like you said?"<p>"That's the essential substance of it young man."<p>"That's pretty deep stuff sir."<p>"As deep as it gets my boy."<p>"It's hard ta believe that anybody could love me that much."<p>"He loves you that much and more Ranma."<p>"Man that's just, I don't know what ta say."<p>**********<p>As the sun comes over the horizon Ranma starts guiltily "It's Morning already?"<p>Glancing over his shoulder at the rising sun the older man nods knowingly "why yes it my young friend."<p>"I'm so sorry sir ta keep you up all night listenin ta me blabber on and on."<p>"No no Ranma it's all right I can't think of anything I would ever do than help someone in need."<p>"Anyway I'm still sorry, and about what you said earlier I'll think about it."<p>"Whatever you say young man, just remember as you know life isn't sure even one minute to the next."<p>"Yes sir, I know I'll think real long and hard on this."<p>"Ranma whatever you do don't take to long, and even if you don't come here find some church to go too.<p>"Yes sir."<p>"And Ranma as to your more physical needs here is an address ask for Kenji tell him I sent you he will give you a job so you can make a little money."<p>"Sir I don't know what to say? Just thank you."<p>"That's all right my boy just remember what I have said."<p>"Yes sir, I'll remember and as for Akane I think your right she may have not trusted me but I didn't respect her or really communicate with her. So even though we, . . . loved each other without those other things you ya can't have a real marriage. It's sad really sir."<p>"Ranma are you sure that you and she can't maybe..."<p>"No sir, I don't think so, I think my mom is right we were just to young. And I also realize that if I had just had the guts to talk ta her, years ago then maybe. . . maybe things can coulda been different. If I had just been upfront and been a little nicer, ya know."<p>"Yes I know, and your short comings in no way excuse her behavior and violence toward you. Ranma if you and she want to come here I'd be willing to counsel you both. I'm sure you both could you some help."<p>"As much as I appreciate that sir, there is just to much bad blood between us. For a while their e'specially that first year of marriage I got so depressed just took what she gave. Till I saw that even Ryoga was starten ta pity me. I mean how did he get so lucky a pig like that, I mean that Akari is one nice girl, Ryoga is one lucky guy, for a pig that is." This last bit said with a smirk.<p>"Ranma you deserve to be that happy and so does Akane." Standing up with a grunt and stretching his back before clicking off the light so that only the light of the morning sun illuminates the room. "I'll be praying for both of you Ranma. Now come on my boy let me buy you some breakfast and I'll take you over ta Kenji's my self."<p>"No sir you don't have ta do that for me you've done too much as it is."<p>With a meek smile "that is my pleasure to help others Ranma that's one of the things I was trying to impress on you."<p>"Yes sir." Chuckling "I don't think I've said so many yes sirs and no sirs in my life."<p>"Well why don't you just call me Hikaru then."<p>"I don't know sir."<p>"Please?"<p>"All right then, Hikaru."<p>"Now my boy lets get some food, that's something someone with your appetite should appreciate."<p>"You got my number sir, I mean Hikaru."<p>"Okay lets go then."<p>And so with a laugh and a pat on the back the two new friends set off. One was happy to have helped someone and the other had a lot to think about, from eternity to his behavior and future.<p>END<p>End notes: well there you have it please let me know what you think. As for the "Sensei" I purposely left the denomination of the minister/priest Hikaru vague. Also as for the references to the things in the church and such Ranma has little experience with such things and his terms are somewhat vague. Sometimes I think that people avoid religion in fics on purpose. I felt the things in this chapter were important to show, one Ranma getting some guidance on his life and future and two as a Christian, I am not ashamed of mentioning that or telling others about it. Now I'm not gonna get all preachy or nothing but I am not afraid to say this. As always please review.<p>Signed: Verse12
