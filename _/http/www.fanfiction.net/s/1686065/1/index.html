</div>Ranma 1/2: For Honor and Love<p>-<p>Sometimes, things happen. Sometimes, things don't.<p>And sometimes, things don't happen as they should.<p>-<p>Nerima Ward, Tokyo, Japan.<p>She had, as always, woken early; watching her dreams fade, and with them<p>the vivid passion that filled her mind as she dreamt. Of him.<p>The psychologists had said it was foolish. Her sisters... Well,<p>one regarded her as a complete nutcase for living a 'celibate' life,<p>while the other respected her and the honor that she upheld for their<p>family.<p>For her... the Art was all. Honor was all. He was all.<p>Spinster, some called her. That she chose to remain unwed past<p>the age regarded normal, that she did not uphold the belief that women<p>should marry young, be the support for their man and cleaner of his<p>house for all of their life, never daring to aspire to anything more...<p>this attitude gained her nothing. The elderly thought her a menace,<p>while the young thought her to be a symbol for women's rights. In truth,<p>she was neither, only going through the motions of living, all the while<p>waiting for the one to whom she had been promised. And he had not yet<p>come.<p>Her thoughts reflected this as she prayed in the family dojo,<p>bowed before the shrine, which represented her mother and father. And<p>she prayed to them, every morning, always for the same thing. `Give me<p>the strength to carry on; your school, your promise, your future, your<p>dreams. Please, send him today. Please, let the day of Saotome-san's<p>arrival be today.`<p>And, as always, she received no answer, mortal or divine. Simply<p>the serene silence that prevailed throughout the Tendou Dojo when no<p>classes were present. When it was she and she alone, left to the motions<p>of living once again.<p>Tightening the red belt which hung at the waist of her gi, Akane<p>Tendou began the first Kata of the Master's Uncial and started what she<p>believed would be another long, uneventful day.<p>She was wrong.<p>-<p>Nerima Ward, Tokyo, Japan.<p>The place of his birth. A place he had not seen since a very<p>young age, and one that seemed more than a lifetime ago. Even after<p>twenty-three years on the road, the tall buildings mixed with rural<p>suburb felt familiar; but were a far cry from the giant trees he had<p>seen, and the bare wilderness that was Mainland China.<p>His Elders had called him foolish. His 'sisters' had scoffed at<p>him, treating him as if his honor had no meaning to them. All but one.<p>And she refrained from speaking to him at all, though he could see the<p>acceptance in her eyes.<p>For him... Honor was all. The Art was all. And to do that which<p>he had promised to do... that was all there was to it.<p>Exiled, for a period of one year, said the tribal elders. As<p>punishment for being an 'upstart male'. Even with his skills, and his<p>condition, they afforded him little respect. Most of the elders believed<p>him to be a menace, the young men looked up to him as if he were a god.<p>He wanted neither the attention, nor the hostility, and had only<p>remained for the training. He was sad to leave, but glad to go. They<p>were a strong and prideful people, as was he- but he was not a docile<p>male servant.<p>He reflected on this, and more as he searched for the reason he<p>had left his home in the first place. A promise he made to his father,<p>the command spoken with the man's dying breath, mixed with a message of<p>love to his mother, whom he hoped was still alive, but feared she was<p>gone.<p>And he found himself there, after getting directions from police<p>and passers-by and several hours of searching, standing with the page<p>from the telephone directory in one hand, the fingers of the other<p>tracing the worn kanji on the wooden sign next to the main gate,<p>proclaiming the house as home to the Tendou School of Anything Goes<p>Martial Arts. He moved it to the side slightly, and it pivoted freely on<p>the small metal peg that held it to the wall. The segment of wall<p>underneath was less weathered than the wall surrounding it. Interest<p>raised, the young man pulled on the sign gingerly, it coming free with<p>surprising ease, having been designed to do so.<p>With the sign in his grasp, Ranma Saotome entered the main gate,<p>initiating a series of events that would change his life in ways he<p>would have never imagined.<p>-<p>Akane's usual solitude was interrupted as she heard the main<p>gate open on its rusty hinge, creaking loud enough to be heard in the<p>enclosed dojo. She terminated the sixth set of the Master's Uncial with<p>a punch that caused the air to snap angrily at her fist, wondering idly<p>who it could be. No students were scheduled for hours, but perhaps one<p>had something they wished to discuss? Or perhaps a new student entirely?<p>She stepped out of stance, bowing towards the shrine before<p>walking to the door of the dojo, grabbing a towel as she left the<p>building and walked into her home. As she continued towards the foyer,<p>she heard the knock she was expecting. "Yes, yes! Just a moment please!"<p>She said, scrubbing much of the sweat out of her long hair, and running<p>the towel over her face and hands. She tossed it into the living room,<p>sliding that door closed as she stepped into the foyer, her bare feet<p>making contact with the cold tile. She shivered slightly before sliding<p>the front door open.<p>-<p>Ranma had been looking at the sign as he knocked. He heard a<p>deep, but feminine, "Hai, Hai! Chottomatte kudasai!" and politely<p>refrained from knocking again, trying to switch his mind's speech into<p>Japanese, a practice he would have been forced to abandon once among the<p>Niechiezu in Joketsuzoku, if not for Elder Koh Lon's mastery of the<p>language, and daily encouragement mingled with quick witted banter,<p>exchanged in formal and non-formal Japanese.<p>A moment later, the door opened, revealing a rather beautiful<p>woman in a rather worn gi, once white but turned yellow through use. The<p>red belt that she wore about her waist served to pique his interest<p>further, as she seemed only slightly younger than he. She wore her hair<p>long, it hung slightly past the gentle curve of her hips, and was<p>unadorned; it shimmered in the sunlight that could penetrate into the<p>house from where they stood. Her eyes were a deep brown, and reflected<p>her curiosity as she first opened the door, and that was shortly<p>followed by anger as her eyes found the sign he held in his grasp.<p>Akane was greeted with the sight of a young man she did not<p>recognize. His eyes were a warm grey, but hard set, as was his jaw.<p>Several faint scars were carelessly littered across his features, and<p>his hair was long, and though hidden, she guessed it ended near the<p>middle of his back. He was dressed in a deep maroon robe with black trim<p>about the neck, cuffs, and the hem. It was tied close to his body by a<p>black sash about his waist, and where the robe continued past the sash,<p>large slits along each side allowed for free movement. His slacks were<p>grey, and he wore simple, black Kung Fu shoes. The entirety of his<p>clothing reminded her of the practitioners of Tai Chi Chuan seen often<p>in parks and parking lots, save for his more serious expression and<p>movements belied no such gentle art.<p>And he held the sign for the Tendou School in his right hand.<p>She bristled immediately. `A Dojo Destroyer?` she thought,<p>imagining him to be one of the roaming Martial Artists who challenged an<p>established School for their sign, and upon winning, would take the sign<p>to dishonor the School.<p>"May I help you?" she asked, trying to keep the hostility out of<p>her voice. She might be wrong. She had been before. Of the ten people to<p>offer her the School's sign, eight had been only that they had found it<p>on the ground. She had fought for it twice, and won.<p>"Yes. I'm Ren Lian Yexin," He replied without thinking, offering<p>her his tribal name instead, and afterwards he cursed himself inwardly.<p>`Idiot!` "... I was sent here." He finished after a moment.<p>"For what reason?" she said, the anger in her tone rising. Her<p>face began to betray her feelings to him.<p>He thought on that, and then said, "I'm not entirely sure."<p>"You aren't?" She asked him, plainly unconvinced. She stepped<p>forward slightly.<p>Ranma held his tongue for a second. Although it was slightly<p>different, he recognized what she was doing. Another step would bring<p>her into a stance similar to the most deceptive 'hidden' stances that<p>were part of his father's 'Anything Goes' style. Or another step could<p>bring her back to an open, unassuming posture. "No. I'm not." He stated,<p>letting the small amount of anguish he still felt, the guilt and<p>depression caused by the passing of his father, into his tone.<p>She did not move. "Then why do you hold my School's sign? Are<p>you here to challenge my honor, and try to take it from me?"<p>"If I knew that I was here for your School's honor, this sign<p>would be for my taking." He said calmly, his tone light and casual<p>despite his words. She narrowed her eyes at him as he continued. "I am<p>not, however, certain of anything at this point, and your aggression<p>towards me is unbecoming."<p>"Then what do you want? I have classes to teach soon." She spat,<p>bitterly.<p>She was disgusted with him, and he knew it; the anger and<p>annoyance etched clearly into her features. She had every right to be,<p>as rude as he was being. He sympathized, but kept his hands to his sides<p>instead of clasped before him, as was his usual. She might think he had<p>let his guard down and try to attack. He really did not want to hurt<p>her. "I have been told the 'Anything Goes' style is practiced by only<p>two families. The Tendou's and the Saotome's..."<p>Akane bristled again. How could he know that? "How do you know<p>that?" Surprise carried with her angry tone of voice as she asked.<p>Ranma paused. He had had about enough of this Tendou. A small<p>fabrication was in order. "I was told this by a dying man, by the name<p>of Saotome. Are you denying this, Tendou-dono?"<p>The honorific, in conjunction with the accusation, was akin to a<p>slap in the face. That, added to the possibility that her Ranma could<p>be... No, she dared not even think it! Her voice wavered, desperation<p>and hope vying with her hatred of the man as she answered his barb.<p>"No. I do not deny what you say. May I ask the name of the man who<p>died?"<p>Odd, Ranma thought. She has some amount of concern for us<p>Saotome's, but why? The truth, he decided, was best now. "Saotome<p>Genma."<p>"Auntie's Husband...?" She whispered hoarsely, a desperate hope<p>filling her voice and shining in her eyes. "Then what of Ranma-san,<p>Saotome Ranma-san?"<p>"..." Ranma said nothing, absorbing her reaction with silence.<p>`Shrugging off the death of my father like one does bad weather, and yet<p>she asks of me with a lover's passion? If she doesn't know Mother's<p>address, I want nothing further to do with this woman!` he thought<p>vehemently, careful to keep his feelings from his face and from coloring<p>his ki. "My instructor of the Anything Goes Style was the one to send<p>me." He said, telling the truth, and then a lie. "I know nothing of this<p>Ranma, save he is alive. We split company shortly after Genma's death.<p>Do you know the location of the home of Mrs. Saotome? I need to inform<p>her as well."<p>Akane narrowed her eyes. "I do no favors to those who insult me.<p>I shall tell her myself, without your aid."<p>There it was, that hostility again. `She is like a switch; her<p>emotions are either on or off. No middle ground at all.` "It is my duty<p>to tell her, I cannot go home until I do so. Are you trying to keep me<p>from my duty?" he offered in retort.<p>She scoffed at him. "That is your problem, not mine. Good day."<p>"Wait." he called, as she stepped back and began to close the<p>shoji. She stopped, briefly, and he held up the sign. "I offer this<p>then: Tell me the location of Saotome-sama's home, and I shall leave you<p>your sign."<p>"You would barter my honor?" She spat, glaring at him more so<p>than before.<p>The sign meant nothing to him. "A challenge of knowledge, then.<p>You know that which I do not. I am defeated. Prove my defeat and you may<p>have your sign, at my dishonor for disturbing your Wa." He said,<p>straining to keep the smile from his face. `Can you refuse that?` He<p>thought, bitterly.<p>She thought on it. "Acceptable. On the condition that you,<p>Yexin, nor any of your students, ever set foot here again, and that you<p>not harm Saotome-san." She said, using the more familiar honorific to<p>show her closeness to the woman in question, a small reminder of who was<p>superior in that relation.<p>"Agreed." he said, with no hesitation.<p>"Stay there. I'll write it down for you. It is far from here,<p>and is located in an old neighborhood." She said, shutting the shoji.<p>She had no intention of opening it again in the next twenty minutes.<p>Ranma knew, by her demeanor, that she would be as cruel as she<p>possibly could without breaking etiquette. He settled in for a long<p>wait, occupying his mind by looking over the house from where he stood.<p>The exterior wall had obscured much of the house as he entered, and he<p>hadn't the time to notice it while 'speaking' with the Tendou woman. It<p>was a grand old house, of traditional Japanese design, and was fairly<p>sizable. An ancestral home, he supposed, with the amount of land the<p>wall encompassed. He guessed it to have two stories by the way the roof<p>was shaped, and began inspecting the greenery around the front<p>entrance. It was well kept, but lacked the flair that was evident in the<p>work of someone who was passionate about gardening. `Probably has her<p>students do the weeding for her...` he surmised.<p>The time passed swiftly, and she returned to the doorway with a<p>sheet of instructions written in fairly decent calligraphy. They<p>exchanged items wordlessly, and afterwards she turned and shut the door<p>with more force than necessary.<p>Ranma growled softly as he walked away. `Damn uppity, self<p>centered, prideful, arrogant bitch.`<p>From behind the door, Akane thought roughly the same of him.<p>`Low born, holier-than thou, contemptuous Chinese dog! I'm glad I took<p>the time to call and warn Auntie Nodoka about him. She'll clean his<p>clock! Too bad about Uncle Saotome, though; Auntie took it like she<p>expected it or something... but... Ranma? Where is he? Does he not know<p>I'm here, waiting for him?`<p>The answer to that was, in more ways, only a few feet behind<p>her. As far as she was concerned, however, she would never willingly<p>speak to Ren Lian Yexin again.<p>It might not have surprised her, then, that Ren Lian Yexin<p>shared the sentiment.<p>It was not to last.<p>-<p>Tendou-san, as it turned out, may have had no love lost for him,<p>but wrote extremely precise directions; using obvious landmarks as a<p>guide. He ignored the disdainful tone the directions were written in<p>because of that. He had to ask for assistance only once, and then only<p>because a store display had been changed from the one described.<p>After twenty minutes or so, Ranma found a small, traditional<p>style house surrounded by a low half-wall. On the wall near the gate<p>there was a bronze plaque inscribed 'Saotome Nodoka'. Beyond the wall<p>was a modest yard that, like the house, was well maintained and<p>obviously cared for. He opened the gate and stepped through, turning to<p>shut it again; as he did so, he heard a door open and footsteps. He<p>turned around.<p>Immediately before him there stood a regal woman of latter<p>years. She was still very beautiful, and he could see the resemblance<p>between her and his features. She was dressed in a three-layer kimono,<p>the outermost layer a pristine white with a faint touch of pink in<p>random places- cherry blossoms, he realized -, with an old katana held<p>by the scabbard in her right hand, the face of the blade down. She was<p>telling him something with the sword, and he recognized it: I am willing<p>to talk, but also willing to shed blood. A general 'tread carefully'. He<p>bowed, deeper than necessary; respectful for her warning and ashamed for<p>the blow he was about to deal her emotionally.<p>"You are the one who accosted my niece, are you not?" she stated<p>more than asked, her tone of voice belying nothing. Something struck him<p>as odd, and after a moment he realized he could not sense her ki; where<p>he should have 'seen' it, there was... absence, a void. Her tongue may<p>as well be silk wrapped steel, for if she did not wish him to know her<p>true intent, he would not know it.<p>`No wonder father married her! Best to be cautious, but how to<p>salvage the impression she has of me? Discredit the person she knows<p>or... No, better to allow the dishonor to continue for a short while.`<p>He bowed again, lower. "My apologies. It was not my intention to<p>exchange words with Tendou-dono, as I do not know my business with the<p>Tendou clan, and probably never shall; my only intention was that I find<p>you, and it would seem I have chosen an improper way to do this. Again,<p>my apologies."<p>She flipped the blade face upwards in a deft motion that showed<p>her skill, and brought her left hand across her front, taking hold of<p>her right wrist in the proper way to hold a blade when one was<p>completely relaxed, and in no need to draw it. "Because you admit your<p>fault, and of your choice of words regarding Miss Tendou, I believe you.<p>Miss Tendou has had a quick temper since her birth, and doubly so when<p>it comes to anything involving men. She has forewarned me of your<p>arrival, and said... you bring news of my husband's death?"<p>Again, though stated as a question, her tone felt as if she were<p>simply stating fact. He knelt before her, bowed at the waist, and held<p>his bow while speaking. "It is an unfortunate duty of mine to tell you<p>of the death of Saotome Genma. After cursing his son at Jusenkyou, 'The<p>Valley of Tears', and a brief altercation afterwards, Saotome Genma was<p>knocked into a brittle bamboo pole, held fast in the center of one of<p>the many springs. It..." He paused for a brief moment, collecting<p>himself before continuing. "It pierced his abdomen, and penetrated his<p>heart. We were far from any medical help, and he was far beyond what<p>little help there was. After instructing me to both visit the Tendou's<p>and my mother, he died, fourteenth of May, year one thousand, nine<p>hundred and ninety one. "*<p>Silence fell over both of them as he finished, his forehead<p>against the back of his hands, pressed to the earth.<p>A moment later he heard a clatter and a muffled thump, but dared<p>not look up until a light touch settled on his shoulder. He met the tear<p>filled gaze of his mother, her lips trembling, as was her entire being.<p>"A-are you...? But Akane said...!"<p>He smiled faintly. "The name I gave Miss Tendou was an accident;<p>it is the name I have used for the past twelve years. My birth name<p>is... Saotome Ranma."<p>She raised her hand and muffled a gasping sob, fighting to<p>breathe and cry at the same time. "My son?" she asked in a tear filled<p>voice, wonder, sadness and amazement rolled into those two small words,<p>with a lot of love thrown in between. The hand she had touched his<p>shoulder with floundered, waiving about as if wanting desperately to<p>touch him again, but afraid to do so.<p>Ranma did the only thing he could do. He swept the beleaguered<p>woman into a tight embrace, and whispered to her the words she had so<p>longed to hear.<p>"I have returned home, mother... And I am so, so very sorry."<p>The two Saotome's cried openly together, on the steps to<p>Nodoka's home, uncaring for a moment of what the world might think on<p>that bright, Sunday afternoon; lost as they were in grief, both recent<p>and remembered, and in the joy of reunion.<p>-<p>He did not know how long they had stayed there, in each other's<p>arms, comforting one another. But at one point they pulled apart, and in<p>doing so felt the emotions twice fold. She retrieved the sword from<p>where it had fallen from her nerveless grasp, and politely invited him<p>in for tea. Ranma had no intention of refusing.<p>Hours past as she told him of her life before he and his father<p>had left on that eventful trip, and also of the life she scraped<p>together for herself after they had gone. Of neighbors, friends, and<p>also of Tendou Soun and his wife, Kimiko. Of their young daughters, the<p>times they spent on outings, and friendly visits. Of Kimiko's sudden and<p>unexplainable illness, and the devastation her death brought to her<p>family. Of the girls growing up without their mother, and with a now<p>weak willed father. Of Soun's strange illness, and his eventual death,<p>so much like his wife's. Of how the girls went on, and made lives for<p>themselves. And of how she went on.<p>And Ranma sat through all of it, drinking his tea, laughing at<p>jokes, murmuring pleasant nothings during the sad tales, and smiling<p>throughout the rest. This was what he was missing in his life. This was<p>who he had wanted to meet, this strong, sad, vibrant woman who lent him<p>so much of her strength and will to survive, even though he could barely<p>remember her. But he remembered her smile. And her laugh, the way it<p>crinkled her eyes and the way she shook her head while doing it... And<p>that both amazed and comforted him, the mother he had thought all but<p>forgotten still lived within his heart, and in the world.<p>He wiped away a tear, and she paused in mid sentence about Mrs.<p>Takuma's spiced apple pie. "What is it, dear?"<p>"Everything. You, the stories..." At that her face fell<p>slightly, worried he was being driven to boredom, but his next words<p>reassured her, "I've waited my whole life for this. I'm just... I'm just<p>so glad you're alive, and that I can be here and hear about you." He<p>finished, smiling.<p>"Oh, posh!" She said, playfully slapping his knee. "I'm just an<p>old maid. A forty five year old housewife with no husband to dirty the<p>house..." she trailed off, looking down at the low table they both sat<p>at, in the main room of her small home. She retrieved her tea and took a<p>sip, covering for her lapse.<p>"Are you alright, mother?" Ranma asked, concern coloring his<p>words. At this she set her cup back down, and met his gaze with sad<p>eyes.<p>"I don't know, my son. When... Thirteen years ago, Soun received<p>a message from your father." she paused, and he gave her a blank<p>expression, but voiced an affirmative for her to continue. "A simple<p>postcard, from China. Genma said... That he would be returning from the<p>mainland in a few days. Soun, the poor dear, didn't contact me, assuming<p>I had received word from my husband well before he himself had. But, a<p>few weeks after the message came, he called, and asked if you both had<p>returned home. I went to see him at once, and read the message myself,<p>several times. So we waited, for you both to come home. And after a year<p>had passed, with no further word from either of you, I..." she stopped,<p>taking a deep breath to reassure herself. "Soun never gave up hope that<p>you were both alive, never once doubted that someday, you would return.<p>But, I'm afraid I couldn't share the same opinion. So, when another year<p>had come and gone, I grieved for you in private.<p>"And now, you're home, but my husband is not with you. I feel as<p>if dreaming, but I know this is real. I'm so glad to have you with me,<p>even as I feel saddened by your news of Genma's... I just don't know<p>what I should feel." she finished, forcing herself to smile for him, as<p>she retrieved her cup and took another long drink of the soothing, hot<p>green tea.<p>"I vaguely remember the day father sent that card, in a dirty,<p>squalid town whose name memory has forgotten. I asked him, 'to whom do<p>you send such a thing?' He only smiled that salacious grin, offering a<p>whimsical 'You'll meet them soon enough.' That was, I believe, a week<p>before I was cursed."<p>"There, now... you've said that twice. What is it you mean by<p>'cursed?'" She asked, growing concerned. "Not some physical malady is<p>it?"<p>Ranma hesitated. He knew from experience that the human mind<p>could only take in so much at one time. His mother, though strong she<p>was, was ill prepared to grasp the true nature of his curse at the<p>moment. Instead, he chose to defer. "Malady? No. But it is a physical...<p>difficulty. I would explain more, but..." He heaved a large sigh,<p>exhaustion mixed with bitterness and old resentment, and no few regrets.<p>"It is long, involved, and very, very complicated. To explain now would<p>be to invite madness, as we are already frayed emotionally. I will tell<p>you, be sure of that, when the time comes. Comfort yourself in the<p>knowledge that it is nothing truly bad, just... challenging." He<p>shrugged, and offered a bit of a smile. "I've learned to live with it."<p>"I... see."<p>"Let us say, it has given me a different perspective on life."<p>Nodoka suddenly narrowed her eyes. "You are not an eunuch, are<p>you?"<p>Ranma blinked, then chuckled. "No, no. That is most defiantly<p>not the problem. Rather the contrary, in fact -This curse changed into a<p>slight blessing in the form of female attentions, at least insofar as<p>within the place I called home. Had many, many girls considering me as a<p>potential husband, and quite a few more than that just looking for a<p>single night alone. But I won't go into much detail; such things are<p>crude to speak of at the best of times."<p>"My, unabashed, aren't we?" she said, smiling. But she also<p>shook her head. "Unabashed, but not rude. Genma did not teach you these<p>things, but whomever did, I must say, has done a fine job."<p>"It was said to me, once, by my mentor, that father served as<p>the anvil, using the Art as his hammer to shape me. But father, even at<p>his best, was an uncouth lout, cruder than the oil suspended in a<p>quenching tank. No, though father was responsible for forging within me<p>a soul of steel, my mentor honed my edge on her vast knowledge and<p>experience, turning me into a true weapon. Something father could never<p>have done."<p>"I had doubts. Many, many doubts. But he was so afraid you would<p>be spoiled if he remained here, with me to 'coddle' you-"<p>Ranma broke in, grimacing. "Coddling meaning 'Preventing him<p>from using inhumane practices in the name of advancing his son and heir<p>in the principles of the Art'."<p>It was Nodoka's turn to grimace. "As I said, I had my doubts on<p>letting him go. Genma was a vile, cowardly, sneaky, and fiendishly<p>seductive young man, if you could believe such a thing to be true. The<p>only reason he was able to marry me, truth be told." She smiled grimly,<p>a hint of wry humor showing. "Youth and stupidity go hand in hand, I'm<p>afraid. As does gullibility and lust. Quite a handsome young man, your<p>father was, with his fighter's physique. He seduced me, of that you can<p>be certain, and tried to marry into money. My father would have none of<p>it, cutting me off from the finances while I was blinded by that young<p>snake's lies. And then, I was with child. Barely seventeen, and with<p>child. So scandalous, that was back then! Genma had to marry me or be<p>forced to end his career in the Art. And so he did. And so he did."<p>He sat, absorbing this information about his father silently.<p>After a moment, his mother continued. "Everyone said I was too good for<p>the likes of him. Wasted on him, really. And, after a year of raising<p>you and having an empty home, and when it wasn't empty, a home full of<p>bitter arguments and reeking of Sake`, that I began to believe them. And<p>began to resent the man I thought I had loved. Regret and anger, brewed<p>for three long, bitter years, and when he proposed to take you away from<p>me, to train in the ways of a 'proper martial artist', I had my doubts.<p>Oh, I had my doubts. But I also saw it as a chance of escape. And so I<p>let him go, taking my precious son from me, just so I could get away<p>from the vile person I had foolishly opened myself to."<p>Ranma began to say something, but she waived him down. "No, you<p>should know this. Take this as words from the heavens to be writ on your<p>very soul: For every decision there is always more than one factor<p>behind the reasoning. And always more options than seem apparent. After<p>he left with you, I discovered many things I could have, should have!,<p>done instead. Too late. And, though I would give anything to have those<p>twenty-four years of your life that I missed back, to be with you as I<p>should have been, I know that is impossible. But, looking at you, as you<p>are, and talking with you, I know that those years without you have not<p>been a total waste. You have grown to be a wise, kind man; and I am no<p>longer as foolish as I was. Perhaps we can learn from each other."<p>Ranma nodded, but said nothing. There was nothing to say.<p>Nodoka clapped her hands together, punctuating the sound with<p>her own explosive 'Well!'. "It is getting quite late. You should take a<p>bath before turning in, So... if you would kindly follow?"<p>He did, saying nothing for the rest of the time he was in her<p>company, and for good reason. He had finally pierced a small portion of<p>her defenses, and had glimpsed some of the woman's ki. What he had seen,<p>in that briefest of glimpses, had frightened him. Frightened, and<p>intrigued. And though he did not know the truth behind it, he still<p>loved her, as only a son can love his mother, and she him as only a<p>mother loved a son. For that he had seen as well.<p>And so it came, as darkness sank deeper into the world, after he<p>had bathed and bedded, hearing her do these things also, he heard<p>another sound, just before he was to drift off to sleep. A sound he had<p>heard many times, though, perhaps, not as anguished as this. Not as<p>deep, not as bitter, not as resentful. And certainly not as full of<p>self-hatred and -loathing.<p>So he found himself that evening in his mother's modest bedroom,<p>holding her close under the sheets, comforting her as best he could,<p>just as they both had done earlier that Sunday afternoon, the only<p>difference being their clothing, and the lack of light to see each<p>other.<p>And that lack of light saved Nodoka from his curse. For as the<p>bitter tears soaked deep into his nightclothes, he changed into she; and<p>neither the weeping woman, nor the one soothing, noticed.<p>-<p>Ranma awoke to the sight of an angel. His mother lay by his<p>side, supporting herself on an elbow while she gazed down upon him with<p>an odd expression, reeking of wry humor. "Good morning, my son."<p>He chose not to dwell on it. If there was something that needed<p>to be said, he was quite sure she would say it. "Morning mother."<p>Something about the words bothered him.<p>She chuckled as she watched him stretch luxuriously, like a<p>panther awaking after a nice, long nap, though she knew the person<p>before her had as little true sleep as she. "So scandalous, the<p>neighbors would say, if they knew. 'Her long lost son, after only<p>returning for one day, and she stays with him through the night in her<p>own bed!'" She chuckled again, shaking her head softly. "Even worse,<p>when it turns out her son is truly a woman!"<p>Ranma blinked, at that, and quickly checked as his mother said,<p>"Shocking!"<p>He, She rather now it was confirmed, chuckled nervously. "Heh<p>heh heh... About that..."<p>"...Curse?" She finished for him, looking unconcerned.<p>"Yes. You can read ki, can't you." He stated, knowing now for<p>certain.<p>She smiled again, serenely. "I wasn't idle all those years, you<p>know. Only good thing about Genma, really -he was always passionate<p>about the Art, if little else. Some of that passion rubbed off on me. I<p>decided early on that if he was going to teach you the physical aspects<p>of the Art, I would endeavor to learn the spiritual, and perhaps learn<p>enough by the time you returned to teach you something of value." She<p>shook her head again, albeit sadly. "Sometimes, I do wonder what on<p>earth I was thinking. You can, as well, can't you."<p>The younger woman nodded. "I can, though it is still a technique<p>I'm adapting to my own use, and finding other uses for it."<p>She nodded, understanding. "A word of wisdom, and advice: Be<p>careful. There are some things not meant to be seen." She shuddered<p>slightly, as if reliving some deep seated terror. "Yes, some things are<p>best left in the dark."<p>Ranma wondered at that cryptic phrase, but set it aside. All<p>things come in time.<p>"Well then!" Nodoka said happily, changing the subject. "How<p>about breakfast, over which you can explain the nature of this 'curse'<p>of yours."<p>"Fair enough..." Ranma said, rising.<p>-<p>A traditional Japanese breakfast, and a delicious one as well.<p>Rice, Miso, and a charbroiled fish. Also green tea, and using the hot<p>water and a few glasses of cold, demonstrated his curse until Nodoka was<p>satisfied.<p>"And you are certain Genma did this on purpose?" Nodoka asked,<p>setting down her cup of tea.<p>A rather damp Ranma-chan stopped in her vigorous rubbing of the<p>towel on her hair. "Oh yes. Quiet sure. He said a few words to the guide<p>in Chinese, and the poor man led us to a very particular spring. Took us<p>a few minutes of walking to get there. Once we did, he purposely dunked<p>me. As in, grabbed my throat and chucked me into the water." She<p>scowled, a fierce expression that did not suit her pretty face. "And<p>after I found out what happened..." She trailed off.<p>Nodoka did not snort in derision, or smile serenely. She simply<p>sat, expressionless, for a moment. Then, as if coming to a difficult<p>decision, she spoke. "I do not blame you, Ranma. Had I been in your<p>place, suffering a change of gender, I would have done much the same. I<p>do not fault you for retribution; you didn't try to kill him. It was<p>just a blind twist of fate, nothing more." She drank deeply from her<p>cup, and poured herself more, scowling. "The old dog was asking for it<p>anyway."<p>And that was all that was said, on the death of Saotome Genma.<p>Nothing else was needed by either of them.<p>"I must say, though, that I might know the reason behind your<p>curse. Well, not behind the curse, so much as the reason your father<p>placed it upon you."<p>Ranma draped the towel over her shoulders, sipping her own tea.<p>"Oh?"<p>"Yes. Your father was a weasel, of this you know." Ranma offered<p>her a 'granted' gesture, and she continued, "...but even a weasel plans<p>ahead. As it would, Genma, long before he met me, had trained under a<p>troll of a man named Happosai..."<p>At that name, Ranma jumped to her feet, snarling and raking the<p>air with clawed fingers like the human panther she was. "He WHAT?"<p>Nodoka was taken aback. "What's wrong, Ranma?"<p>"Happosai." The name was a curse more than anything. "That evil<p>little man stole many things of great power and value from the tribe in<p>years long past, and has them still, I am sure." Seeing her lack of<p>understanding, he elaborated. "The person who took me in after father's<p>death, my mentor, was the village elder of the Niechiezu, last of the<p>Amazon peoples."<p>"Amazons?" She asked, cocking her head to one side. "You mean<p>like those mythical women warriors of Greek legend?"<p>"Er, Yes and no... Yes as in their society is the reverse of<p>normal, where women enjoy supremacy over men;" She made a sound, which<p>related her understanding, and Ranma continued. "As for the Mesopotamian<p>Ancestry thing... I'm not a historian, and I never asked. All I know is<p>they were there, and they were generous enough to let me stay with them<p>after..." She trailed off for a moment, looking away briefly before<p>finishing. "They live by a different set of rules than the communists.<p>Many of which dealt with marriage. By their law, any male visitor who<p>defeats a local girl in fair combat is married to her, more or less."<p>"Fascinating."<p>"Yes, but to the point, they have many ancient artifacts of vast<p>spiritual power, kept safe by the tribe, but... Happosai snuck into our<p>village at one point, long ago, and stole a good portion of them. The<p>tribe has standing orders for his capture and punishment."<p>"Which he deserves, I'm sure. And to my point, as your father<p>was instructed by him, so was another man. A rather wealthy one, in<p>fact. His name was Tendou Soun."<p>"The Tendou girl's father?" he asked, recalling the conversation<p>they had last night.<p>"Just so. However, your father had no knowledge of Soun, or that<p>he had had daughters, before he left with you."<p>"And this pertains to my curse, how?"<p>She gave her a wan smile. "Your father arranged for you a<p>marriage into the Tendou family."<p>For a moment the young girl looked lost, and then thoroughly<p>disgusted. "You think he would have...?"<p>"Forced you into a marriage with a son of the Tendou family? I<p>certainly wouldn't put it past him."<p>"But I'm a guy!" At her mother's bemused look, she rallied<p>weakly, "Current appearances non-withstanding."<p>"I'm sure you could have made those claims, however... Soun<p>trusted your father implicitly. From what Soun told me, Genma came up<p>with the plan to entrap a drunken Happosai in a cave, seal him inside of<p>a barrel of Christian holy water covered in wards, dynamite the<p>entrance, and then placed a large statue of the Buddha on top of it<p>all."<p>Ranma considered that, briefly. "Nah. Couldn't have held the old<p>demon much longer than thirty years or so." She retook her place at the<p>table.<p>Nodoka shrugged, "Still, it rid the two men of his presence for<p>the rest of their lives, and your father gained Soun's gratitude and a<p>pledge of marriage for their children. Not to mention the poor fool<p>would have believed your father's lies long before accepting the truth<p>from any other source."<p>Another spark of memory, the way Tendou Akane had asked of him.<p>"And she knows about it." She stated firmly.<p>Her mother nodded. "Akane, yes. All three of them have known,<p>for quite a while. It would seem Soun wrote out an actual contract for<p>it, before he died. I've never seen it, though. Probably should take a<p>look at it, now... Considering."<p>Ranma grimaced. "Last thing I want at this point in my life is<p>to be married to some egotistical, arrogant little..." He stopped.<p>"Sorry. I haven't the highest opinion of Tendou-san, yet."<p>Nodoka simply looked bemused. "It's alright. Akane has never<p>been very polite. She's very brash, you know. Almost boyish, for a woman<p>her age."<p>"The term is 'Butch', mother." She said mildly, drawing a smile<p>from the older woman.<p>"It is, at that. We should pay her a visit, this afternoon,<p>preferably."<p>Ranma dipped her fingers into her teacup, changing again. He was<p>not looking very pleased with the news. "That might be difficult for<p>me." He said, after a moment. "She banned me from the Tendou home."<p>An eyebrow rose. "Banned you? Or some Chinese fellow?"<p>"Mere technicalities, I assure you." He muttered. "I don't<p>believe I could be civil to her at this time anyway. She almost kept me<p>from you."<p>A dark look passed over Nodoka's eyes, one which bode ill for<p>the Tendou girl. "Yes. She almost did, at that." The moment passed, and<p>she was again her normal self. "But, I think you would have tried to<p>find me another way."<p>"I had your address from a telephone directory." He admitted,<p>shrugging. "But decided on the Tendou Dojo first, it seeming closer to<p>the train station than your address, according to the rather unhelpful<p>ward map on the interior cover. It was very difficult to even find that<p>ancient place." He drank of his tea before continuing. "Very<p>troublesome, you Japanese and your convoluted streets. Even Beijing<p>isn't that bad."<p>She chuckled, her eyes resting on him fondly. "We've had so<p>little time together..."<p>"What is on your mind?" Ha asked, sensing her underlying<p>worries.<p>"The engagement agreement. I realize it must be honored or<p>absolved in some way, but..." She hesitated.<p>"...Just not right now. It's too soon." He finished for her,<p>summing up her feelings. "I feel the same, on both accounts." He scowled<p>darkly. "My father's agreement, as you said, should be met or dismissed<p>as honorably as possible. But if it cannot be dismissed..." He trailed<p>off, an almost fearful look coming upon him, "It's too soon, without<p>knowing the exact terms of the agreement."<p>"Yes." She said simply. Silence stretched between them for a<p>moment, each thinking of the future, and of the past.<p>"I need a mother now, more than a wife." Ranma said finally,<p>nodding to himself. "She's waited this long. What are another few days?<p>Weeks? Months in the face of so much time already lost?"<p>Nodoka nodded. "Just so, my son. Just so. The only problem I can<p>foresee is if she were to decide to drop in unannounced. Akane considers<p>me family, and will probably make a social call within the next few days<p>to check up on me, due to that 'dangerous Chinese stranger'."<p>Ranma lapsed into silence as his mother drank from her tea. A<p>plan slowly began forming, one which could offer him the ability to stay<p>with his mother and the security required to dodge the Tendou woman's<p>paranoia. "Tell me, mother... have you any nieces?"<p>"Two, actually... why?"<p>Ranma quickly outlined his plan. He, as Ren Lian Yexin, would<p>leave her house that afternoon, heading back towards the station he used<p>to arrive in Nerima, taking a train to the next ward, only to change<p>gender and clothing in a restroom and return under the guise of a niece<p>sent by a worried sister or in-law to look after the poor woman who,<p>after hearing the news of her husband's death and her only child's<p>whereabouts unknown, would understandably be a miserable wreak. He would<p>then spend the majority of his time in his mother's house as a woman,<p>helping the suddenly widowed Nodoka through her time of 'grief'.<p>"Generally, I like it." Nodoka said after putting the plan<p>through its paces in her own mind. "I have a niece, well, a fist cousin<p>once removed rather, just a bit younger than you, on my mother's side<p>who's mother swears she bears a close resemblance to me at that age -as<p>does your female side. Her name is Akibarae Akiho." She smiled wryly,<p>"And as luck would have it, she's also a bit of a tomboy, and proficient<p>in Jeet Kun Dou, among other things."<p>Ranma blinked. "Any reason why?"<p>"Partly because she was a member of an all women's biker gang,<p>co-leader I should say. Secondly she has a job with a software firm as a<p>model actor for female fighting game characters." She explained.<p>"I see."<p>"You'll need to cut your hair back, though. I'm sure Akane has<p>seen a few recent photos of her. She competes in tournaments quite<p>frequently, and wins often enough to have a certain... fan-following,<p>shall we say?"<p>Ranma nodded. "Just one thing about that, though..." He said,<p>reaching back and untwining a slender object from his hair. His hair<p>immediately began growing, getting visibly longer in the span of a few<p>seconds. He threaded the slender object back into his hair, near his<p>ear, the sudden growth stopping immediately.<p>"What in the world...?" Nodoka exclaimed, reaching out and<p>taking his hair in her hands. "How...?"<p>"Another curse." He said simply.<p>"You seem to have an affinity for acquiring them." She said<p>wryly.<p>"Tell me about it." He groused. "... I stole some soup from this<p>guy in China, and it turned out to be some kind of medieval Rogaine for<p>Men. Basically, if I don't have the Dragon's Whisker in my hair, it will<p>continue to grow until I can't grow anymore, leaving me bald."<p>"Oh, my! How dreadful!"<p>"Indeed. Thankfully, it doesn't affect me while I'm female, so I<p>guess cutting my hair as a girl would be fine. I can pocket the whisker<p>and replace it afterwards." He gave it a moment of thought before<p>shrugging. "I kept it long because that was the style in the tribe.<p>Something shorter might be nice, maybe go back to my old pig-tail..."<p>"After our duplicity, that is." She amended for him, and he<p>nodded.<p>"I'll need to borrow something to wear. I'm afraid I haven't<p>much clothing on me at the moment."<p>"Well then, Let's take a look in my wardrobe, and se if we can't<p>find something that will fit your feminine side." She said with a smile<p>as she rose.<p>Ranma followed, rolling his eyes, stopping once upstairs to<p>splash himself with a bit of cold water before joining Nodoka in her<p>room.<p>His mother, as it turned out, had a very nice selection of<p>Kimonos, which took most of the interior of the large closet, due to the<p>special hangers needed to properly store them. She had a few other<p>things as well, however: A pair of business suits were hanging on a hook<p>near the back, protected by garment bags, one black, and one brown. She<p>also had several nice blouses (Probably to go with the business suits,<p>Ranma reasoned), and some skirts which matched nicely with the blazers.<p>Also were two full length dresses: one formal gown, back with white<p>trim, and a more casual red with a rose pattern. She also had a yellow<p>sundress. At that last, Ranma cocked an eyebrow at her mother.<p>"What? The sundress? I look good in it, I'll have you know." She<p>said mock-indignantly, balled fists on resting on her hips. She held it<p>for a moment before dissolving in a giggle. "Really, though, I haven't<p>worn it in years."<p>"That's a shame. You probably would." She said, thoughtfully.<p>"Oh, quite flattering an old woman." Nodoka said smartly,<p>beginning to browse through the available selections, "I'd look silly in<p>a sundress at my age. And don't get me started on bathing suits!" She<p>finished, but for all the cheer in her tone there was an odd<p>undercurrent of sadness. "In any event, I've always loved Kimonos. I was<p>brought up traditionally, you know. I dare say I hated them when I was<p>young, but they're just so... elegant, I suppose."<p>"'Elegant'," Ranma said, inspecting the items Nodoka was placing<p>aside for her, "...is an understatement."<p>After exiting to her own room and trying on a few selections,<p>they decided on an off-white blouse and black skirt which matched well<p>with each other, and allowed good freedom of movement. Nodoka was<p>concerned with under apparel, but Ranma surprised her by pulling a pair<p>of panties seemingly out of thin air. "Sometimes it's just too<p>bothersome to switch back into a guy, like during rainstorms and such,<p>so I keep a few pairs on my person." She explained, "And then, sometimes<p>my female form serves as a disguise. Best to be prepared, you know?"<p>In the end, the only thing Ranma lacked for his disguise was a<p>bra. "I'll be fine." She said, inspecting her reflection. "You can go<p>shopping for your 'niece' later, you know."<p>"Oh, yes! All this time, spent preparing for you, and now you're<p>here..." She gave a little shiver as her maternal instinct joined the<p>shopaholic in all women, "Ouuooo, so exciting!"<p>The bright gleam in her eyes frightened Ranma a little. "Yes,<p>well. Later, alright?"<p>"Oh, you're no fun at all, Ranma. Oh, I found this while you were<p>changing. Here..." Nodoka handed her a small photograph. "That's Akiho,<p>from a year ago. I believe she still keeps her hair like that."<p>Ranma eyed the photo critically. "You're right, she does look<p>like you." She checked the mirror, and then the photo again. "And me,<p>too. This will work."<p>"Well, it would if you get going already. Oh, yes..." Nodoka<p>turned, and opened a drawer on her nightstand, withdrawing some money.<p>"Here's six thousand yen. There's a very nice hair salon in Ota ward<p>station which should do nicely. And if you need it, they give makeup<p>tips as well."<p>Ranma nodded. While makeup wasn't an unknown accommodation in<p>Joketsuzoku, it was rare, and he had little experience with it himself.<p>But once in Japan, he had noticed almost every woman he had seen was<p>wearing the substance. And some of them weren't wearing it well. "THAT<p>will prove invaluable. I have no idea how to wear cosmetics."<p>"And you claim to have used your female side as a disguise."<p>Nodoka chided jokingly.<p>"I'm sorry," she replied mock-indignantly, "Makeup is the last<p>thing a young Chinese waif like me thinks about when heading out on the<p>town. Successfully removing the manure stains from my slacks is an<p>accomplishment, let alone seeming presentable."<p>"Then again, with your bust, you needn't appear in flowing gowns<p>to attract attention, you only have to stick out your chest." She<p>replied.<p>"Yep, that's me, pride of the village." Ranma muttered, no<p>longer amused. "Damn things scream 'rape me' more than anything else."<p>Nodoka accepted this without comment. "Be careful on the train,<p>in your female form -usually they go for younger women, perverts as they<p>are, but there are some men who delight in fondling a woman's ass or<p>breast in a crowded train compartment. The police do not take kindly to<p>any women who return violence for such indecent behavior."<p>"Delightful. Just when I was thinking Japan wasn't that bad<p>after all. At least in China you can punish the mangy curs."<p>"It shouldn't happen, but... Best to warn you, in any event."<p>Ranma grumbled, and returned to his male form and dress, placing<p>the extra clothing into a large shopping bag. As they returned<p>downstairs, he did something that made Nodoka's eyes cross and water,<p>and then bag was gone. "What...?"<p>"Hidden weapons technique, comes in handy for carrying things<p>without carrying them. A friend taught me how to do it." He briefly<p>explained.<p>"How does this technique work?"<p>He shrugged. "Better to ask, 'how does ki work?' There is no<p>answer, only that it does. If you believe in it."<p>She sighed, knowing full well what he meant. "You'll have to<p>teach me, sometime." She slid the door open for him, and he stepped<p>through, turning back to her.<p>"Then, I'll be going."<p>"Yes. Return home safely."<p>"I will." He said, and then left.<p>Retracing his way back to the train station was not as difficult<p>as finding his way to his mother's home, yet he knew it would be a while<p>yet before he could make the journey without directions. He spent the<p>ride to Ota in pleasant remembrance of his conversations with his<p>mother, and thinking how lucky indeed she was still alive, and such a<p>wonderful person. The darkness which colored her ki was still troubling<p>him, albeit only slightly; there would be time and enough to find out<p>what it was. An idea occurred to him as the train began to slow on<p>approach to the station: he ought to send word to elder Koh Lon to send<p>his things to his mother's address... And maybe she would know something<p>of darkened ki. If his mother did not breech the topic by the time the<p>reply from china came, he would have an answer either way. So it was<p>that he stopped by a souvenir stand and purchased enough materials to<p>compose a letter, and promptly sent it towards China. It would get there<p>soon enough.<p>A quick splash at a drinking fountain brought the desired<p>change, and he quickly retrieved and dressed in the feminine clothing in<p>the ladies restroom. Afterwards, he placed his clothes in the bag and<p>folded it back into nothing.<p>The young miss behind the counter of the station's beauty parlor<p>was surprised at the young beauty that walked in without an appointment,<p>requesting not only a trim and a perm for her luxurious dark copper<p>hair, but a make-over as well. Taking the task, she and three assistants<p>cut, shaped, and painted their way to perfection. After an hour, Ranma<p>walked out of the salon in a daze -the stylists having rendered her<p>stunning to even herself. The discount they gave her for simply being so<p>beautiful came as a blow, too; nearly 40% off the original price,<p>leaving her with a fair bit of cash left over.<p>What happened next was shocking, as well, but for a different reason.<p>"Behold! What ere beauty lye yonder? Hark, man, delay me not<p>and quicken thy steps to the goddess!" came a bold shout from half-way<p>across the station. It served to not only alert the milling crowd to<p>move aside or be trampled in the man's haste to meet with 'divinity',<p>but also managed to snap Ranma from her self-imposed stupor.<p>The sight that greeted her upon returning to her senses was<p>mildly amusing. A man, dressed in a gi and hakuma, bokuto thrust skyward<p>before his advance, was running to her as an Olympian to the finish<p>line. Seeing he was noticed seemed to only encourage him further, as he<p>slid upon his wooden geta to a perfect halt, kneeling before her. No<p>mean feat, that.<p>As she stared at the man, who was roguishly handsome, he began a<p>monologue. "Alas, is it an Angel sent before me, to remove me from the<p>living and guide my poor soul to the heavens? Or a Goddess, descended to<p>outshine the most beautiful mortal, and remind us what for true beauty<p>be? Oh, for only had I the answer, but instead I beg, if only for a<p>moment, look upon my unworthy self and grant Kuno Tatewaki, single, age<p>twenty nine and three quarters, the boon of your blessed name!"<p>It took Ranma a moment to fully translate what the man, looking<p>at her as a devoted servant, was truly saying; his language being an<p>archaic form of Japanese. Once she had it, though, she could barely<p>stifle the laugh that threatened to burst forth. Thankfully, however,<p>she did. "Rise, Samurai. 'Tis not the proper place for a man of your<p>station to be kneeling on the earth."<p>"Alas, I would be honored to stay thus for thee, but at thy<p>bidding, I shall rise." And he did, causing Ranma to look quite a way up<p>in the process.<p>"As to your question, Kuno-san, I am Akibarae Akiho, not a<p>goddess. Simply a fair maid, like the rest about us." She said,<p>referring the now quite obvious crowd gathered around them.<p>"Nay! Say not such blasphemous things! You are like a beacon to<p>their waning candles, a true representation of their meager forgery of<p>beauty. A rare sight to behold are you, fair Akibarae-sama, and rarer<p>still as I, to the lament of the very heavens!, must depart." Kuno said,<p>real tears falling freely from his eyes, his very being crying out in<p>remorse. Ranma would have dismissed it as play-acting if she could not<p>read his ki, and the truth of the actions.<p>'Wow. This guy wears his heart on his sleeve.` She thought,<p>thinking kindly of him despite the unwanted attention. "Sad tidings<p>indeed, Kuno-san. But I wish thee well."<p>"And I thee, fair Akibarae-sama!" In the blink of an eye, he<p>brought forth a dozen red roses and presented them to her. "Take this,<p>though, a minor tribute to the wonder that is yourself."<p>Ranma blinked. That had been close to, but not quite, the Hidden<p>Weapons technique. `Intriguing.` "I thank thee. Now, I bid thee take<p>leave, before thy train departs."<p>"Indeed. Farewell!" And with a final smile, he was gone.<p>The crowd about her was whispering amongst themselves at the<p>display, but Ranma paid them no mind. A strange, kindly man, the<p>encounter of whom left her in the possession of a dozen red roses. An<p>expensive bouquet to be had in Japan.<p>They would make a fitting gift to her mother.<p>Maybe a chocolate cake, too...<p>Ranma found herself weighted down with the roses, and a bag<p>containing cakes and pastries enough for five during the ride back; but<p>she didn't mind. The expression on her mother's face when she came home<p>would be more than worth it.<p>The look on Nodoka's face was indeed worth it, but only slightly<p>offset what was to come. "Ra- Ara, Akiho! I wasn't expecting you so<p>soon!"<p>"Hello, Mother! I come, bearing gifts, as well."<p>Nodoka's smile practically lit up the room as she saw the roses.<p>Oddly, though, it faded as quickly as it appeared. "You shouldn't have,<p>dear... but come in, come in, there are two people here I'd like you to<p>meet."<p>Ranma allowed herself to be ushered inside, and then stood<p>still, as she recognized the two other people in the modest living room.<p>"You?" She said kindly to one, and then a flatter, "Oh."<p>"By the gods, the heavens show but infinite mercy!"<p>"What in the hell are you going on about now?"<p>"Akiho," Nodoka cut in, smiling tiredly, "I'd like you to meet<p>my late friend's daughter, Tendou Akane... and her escort, Kuno<p>Tatewaki. Akane-chan, Kuno-san, this is my niece, Akibarae Akiho."<p>"Pleased to meet you." She said with as much false cheer as she<p>could manage. "Again."<p>End Chapter One.<p>Author's Notes:<p>End Chapter One. My GOD how it does feel good to say that. Even<p>if it hasn't been fully pre-read or completely tweaked the way I'd like<p>it, It's still a great feeling. I've been working on this off and on,<p>mostly off, ever since the idea for it first struck me in back in 1996.<p>The first version I regard as a highly successful failure, and this<p>second... I'd like to think it refined a lot, while still touching on<p>many of the theoretical questioned raised in the first. What would<p>happen if an older Ranma came to the Tendou home, sans Genma? And if<p>Ranma met with his mother with no reservations, how would their meeting<p>go? What kind of relationship could a more mature Akane and Ranma create<p>for themselves, or would one even be possible? Would Kuno still be a<p>Fruit Basket?<p>Surely I haven't answered them all yet, which is good -leaves me<p>with more material to use for future chapters. And yes, I do plan on<p>writing more of this. It's too good to let alone, and I know I'm slow at<p>producing decent chunks of writing, but I'm slow because I want it to be<p>decent. Trade-offs, always trade offs.<p>I have a long list of acknowledgements to be made for this. Many<p>people have helped with this piece, first and foremost being my dear<p>friend Johanna Pierson.
