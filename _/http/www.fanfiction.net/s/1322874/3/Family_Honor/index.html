</div>Family Honor<br/>Ch3: Things to Do in Nerima When You're Dead<p>DISCLAIMER:<br/>Ranma and so on<br/>They are not my characters<br/>They are Rumiko's<p>PREVIOUSLY: Ranma and Genma have arrived at the Tendo's.<br/>Ranma has an invisible dog that's an out growth of his superego<br/>named Family Honor. Kasumi is an eight-armed human-sized pink<br/>and purple polka-dotted sasquatch. An enchanted ring has made all<br/>the animals around the koi pond intelligent. Nabiki has recruited a<br/>communist squirrel for her cause, enticing it with potato chips.<br/>Finally Soun's wife is not really dead. She's just been faking it the<br/>last ten years.<p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~<p>Shampoo perched atop the middle of the giant 'w' of the Whammy<br/>Burger, her long, violet hair billowing in the wind. From this<br/>vantage she could observe a good portion of Nerima's business<br/>district, but there was no panda or pigtail to be seen.<p>Shampoo gritted her teeth. She was a proud warrior, and an<br/>excellent tracker. She had the culmination of three thousand years<br/>of Amazonian teachings in her brain, and she could kill with barely<br/>a movement if it weren't for her pesky morality getting in the way.<br/>Still, the fact remained that at the moment the only lead she had to<br/>go on was that Ranma and his father would be staying at a place<br/>called the Tendo Dojo, and Shampoo had no idea where that was.<br/>There was simply no avoiding it...<p>She would have to ask somebody for directions.<p>She stayed for a moment, taking in the bustle and hustle of this city,<br/>so different from her village. She liked watching the people go to<br/>and fro, thinking their private thoughts without realizing they were<br/>being watched. From this angle, the Japanese people seemed<br/>almost normal and not the backwards, lecherous, condescending<br/>bastards they really were.<p>Ranma was different of course. Ranma had been her friend for<br/>several months back in her village. Shampoo had always been<br/>something of a loner, but she showed Ranma all of the secret caves<br/>in the mountains that she went to, the waterfall, the place in the<br/>green valley where you can see the sun rise between two peaks<br/>only twice in a year. At first, she had been quiet, but something<br/>about Ranma...it just made her want to talk. It wasn't until the<br/>elders agreed to annul the Kiss of Death and Ranma left with his<br/>father that she had realized she loved him.<p>And so Shampoo petitioned the Elders to allow her to take a<br/>sabbatical to Japan, nominally to expand her horizons and learn<br/>about the culture, but really only to find some way to get Ranma to<br/>stay with her forever. She had already gotten much of the language<br/>from Ranma, and before leaving, she learned more from her<br/>great-grandmother, as well as some pertinent culture differences.<br/>One in particular that had been driven home since was that, in<br/>Japan, women were barely looked at as equals, hardly ever as the<br/>superior sex.<p>Shampoo took a breath and steeled herself for another bout with<br/>foreign ignorance before launching into the air, completing a<br/>double somersault and twisting to land in front of the entrance to<br/>the Whammy Burger in a three point crouch.<p>She tried to walk inside, but was impeded by that strange form of<br/>force field that the natives were in the habit of using. Opening the<br/>door seemed like such a waste of time, and the force field annoyed<br/>Shampoo...so she just retrieved her bonbori from null-space and smashed<br/>through it. She was beginning to wonder if she should bother with doors<br/>at all.<p>Inside was a curious sight. Every table and booth was occupied by blond-<br/>haired oriental girls of various ages all wearing long, ankle length<br/>skirts, heavy boots and doctor's face masks. Several of them stood<br/>up and looked rather angry about something. This was...different.<p>Shampoo permitted one of them to grab her by the collar of her<br/>cheongsam and slam her against the wall. This girl seemed about<br/>Shampoo's age and build but was a little taller with the black of<br/>her roots showing in her otherwise blond hair. Shampoo was a little<br/>curious.<p>"You stupid chinky bitchlet! That our window, seen?"<p>"Excuse me? I'm afraid I don't understand your manner of<br/>speech." Shampoo said, frowning.<p>The girl smiled smugly and looked around at her compatriots. "Are<br/>you chuggin this, yanklets? Chinky here don't ken me! Mayhap we<br/>oughtta pipe chinpoko-jin back where she from ne?"<p>There were several murmurs of assent and a few girls yelled<br/>"SEEN!"<p>Shampoo had studied Japanese very diligently. She didn't know<br/>why she wasn't able to understand these people. "Please, I'm just<br/>trying to find someone. If you wish to fight me, challenge<br/>me in a respectable manner or else I may have to hurt you."<p>"Oooh, Chinky panty twistin ne? She sparks a bit, mayhap. You<br/>best chug me though, bitchlet, we Yankii the ~fire~." And with<br/>that, the girl threw Shampoo toward one of the tables.<p>Shampoo twisted in the air and made a perfect landing on the<br/>table's surface. "So be it. You will find yourselves in pieces<br/>shortly!" Shampoo yelled.<p>A girl swung a lead pipe at Shampoo's legs. Shampoo hopped over<br/>this and spun low across the table, sending the heel of her foot into<br/>the girl's temple, knocking her out. Another girl turned her back<br/>toward Shampoo, jumped into the air and flipped, her two steeltoe-<br/>booted feet now heading straight for Shampoo's head. Shampoo<br/>was so amazed she almost didn't roll away from the attack.<p>Another girl tried to club her, but Shampoo stepped inside the<br/>attack, grabbed the girl's arms, shoved a knee hard into her solar<br/>plexus, picked her up and swung her into another girl that was<br/>charging her.<p>Shampoo had cleared a small space for herself and now stood in an<br/>easy ready stance waiting for the girls' next move.<p>"Stop!" a woman said, entering from the kitchen area and holding<br/>her arms up to garner attention. She was dressed in more or less<br/>the same style as the other girls, but her clothes were of better<br/>quality and she was much older. Everything she wore was black,<br/>from her dress with its red, spider web pattern to her face mask<br/>which seemed made of satin and had a red hourglass decorating it.<br/>The most striking difference was that unlike the other girls' blond<br/>hair, her hair was long, dark and had a lustrous sheen that seemed<br/>to glint blue in the light. "Girl's sparky, seen? You yanklets gonna<br/>doze the demesne!"<p>The girls started to back off warily. Shampoo glanced at them and<br/>then addressed the woman. "Are you the leader?"<p>The woman nodded "I am Missus Vicious. What do you want?"<p>Shampoo did not get out of her ready position. "I'm looking for<br/>Saotome Ranma. I was told he would be staying here, in Nerima,<br/>at the Tendo dojo. Would you happen to know where that is?"<p>Shampoo saw "Vicious" tighten her lips underneath the red<br/>hourglass on the face mask. The woman's fist clenched. "Yes. I<br/>know where that is. Would you like me to take you there?"<p>Shampoo thinned her eyes. Vicious's body language didn't match<br/>her words. "If you could... that would be ni-" and a blunt<br/>instrument came crashing into the back of Shampoo's skull.<p>To sneak up on her like that...the girls had some skill...<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Missus Vicious sat smoking a cigar in the driver's seat of the black<br/>minivan with her elbow out of the open window as Masaki Chihiro<br/>finished putting the cooler of lunch bags into the minivan. Many of<br/>the girls were looking through the back window and snickering.<p>Chihiro came around to Vicious's window. She wore black slacks<br/>and a pin-striped blouse and her hair was put up in a bun, long<br/>strands of it falling on her face as bangs. She was the owner of the<br/>Whammy Burger. "You don't ever think you're getting too old for<br/>this?"<p>Vicious snorted, tossing the stub of her cigar to the ground and<br/>reattaching her face mask. "You never grow out of the Yankii. You<br/>don't leave unless you're beaten out."<p>"But, you're thirty-seven! You should be settling down, or at least<br/>getting a good job! You'll break your back, doing that construction<br/>work."<p>"Look, Chichi, I've told you this before. Even if I wanted to stop, I<br/>can't. The girls need me. The Yankii are all they've got. They're<br/>going to turn to the streets anyway, at least now they have some<br/>self respect. As if you'd have lasted a day without our help. You<br/>used to be one of us, remember."<p>"I took my beating long ago, Vicious," Chihiro said, crossing her<br/>arms in front of her, "And the only reason I need your money is<br/>because you keep scaring away my customers and breaking<br/>things!" She looked toward the ground and sighed, collecting<br/>herself. She looked up again brushing a strand of hair from her<br/>face. "You're my friend, and I hope that will never change, but<br/>you've got to let this go. It's not healthy. Not for you and not for<br/>the Yankii."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"You're in a minivan! You take them to school! What kind of gang<br/>leader does that!"<p>"Well we do have a girl tied to the back bumper on roller-skates..."<p>"You see!" Chihiro pointed, "You gave her roller-skates! You're<br/>going soft!"<p>"But she's naked..."<p>"Right and you're liable to get arrested for child exploitation or<br/>worse if the cops see you."<p>"We've paid off the cops. There won't be any problem. Besides<br/>the girl's a martial artist. She'll be fine."<p>"Look," Chihiro closed her eyes and shook her head, holding her<br/>hand to her temple. when she looked up again, her gaze was<br/>intense. "I know you aren't going to listen to me, but please, listen<br/>to your heart. You miss them. I know you do. I see it in your<br/>eyes..." For a moment Vicious was caught by her friend's intensity.<br/>She could almost believe Chihiro ~was~ reading something that was<br/>inside her, imprinted on her soul...<p>Vicious shook her head and turned the key in the ignition. "I don't<br/>want to hear it. That was another life. That wasn't me, and that was<br/>ten years ago. Goodbye."<p>And with that, Missus Vicious, aka Tendo Kirika pulled out of the<br/>parking lot of the Whammy Burger in her minivan full of gang<br/>members and with a naked Amazon in tow.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>The Ring was not very old. It existed only a century at most, and<br/>so it was still learning the ropes of how to use its magic. The girl<br/>Akane didn't want to be a nice person...didn't want to be a dainty<br/>maiden, but she kept the Ring on her finger all the same, and as<br/>long as she didn't take it off, it could communicate with her after a<br/>fashion through thoughts and images.<p>The girl wanted to know about her mother. Not the gracious<br/>housekeeper that had birthed her and raised her for four years, but<br/>the woman before Tendo Soun offered the Ring, and the woman<br/>that was her mother for those two years after the Ring was thrown<br/>into the pond. The Ring didn't know how to help Akane at first. It<br/>had thought that it would only be able to show the times the Tendo<br/>matron had worn it. But then it realized that it could access<br/>memories and dreams and these were often beyond its influence.<p>The Ring was incredibly lonely. It wanted to stay with Akane as<br/>much as possible. So to keep Akane from taking it off, it showed<br/>Akane everything she wanted to know. It showed the memories of<br/>Akane's mother. Of how Tendo Kirika had been a member of a<br/>street gang, of how she used to dye her hair blond and speak<br/>in gutter language in emulation of the Americans she saw on the<br/>screen, even though her father was American and was nothing like<br/>all that. The Ring showed Akane about how before Kirika's<br/>mother died she used to sneak around the army base, learning<br/>about all the weaponry, wanting to be a soldier like her<br/>father...about how her mother's death caused a rift in her<br/>relationship with her father that was filled by the gang. By<br/>belonging to something. The Ring showed how Kirika rose in the<br/>ranks of the gang swiftly with her incredible ability to deal with<br/>people and her considerable prowess with martial arts.<p>Finally the Ring showed Akane how Kirika had met Soun, beating<br/>him up after he had stolen some underwear from her and her gang<br/>members. He kept coming back afterwards, wanting to spend time<br/>with her, and even though she consistently pounded him into the<br/>stratosphere, he was relentless and the two of them developed a<br/>strange sort of relationship. He saved her life. She saved his.<br/>Maybe something would have happened anyway...<p>But Soun had bought an engagement ring.<p>All the Ring had wanted was for Kirika to be happy. The Ring<br/>knew that in order for a woman to be happy she had to have a man<br/>to love her and children to care for. When the Ring changed<br/>Kirika's personality the girl had ~seemed~ happy enough, and it<br/>really was a glorious wedding, but even the Ring realized on some<br/>level that a part of Kirika, a good part, was dying inside her.<p>The gang had actually left her alone pretty much. Soun had<br/>become a rather prominent figure in the ward and Kirika helped<br/>out the gang financially and legally without provocation even<br/>while under the Ring's influence. She could have been happy<br/>forever like that, after a fashion. But Kirika's dreams grew<br/>increasingly restless.<p>In the moment between waking and sleeping, in the twilight of<br/>consciousness, Kirika was herself completely. And one night,<br/>during this twilight, Soun came to bed drunk, babbling about some<br/>contract he had made with his old friend Genma that one of his<br/>daughters would marry Ranma, Genma's son and thereby combine<br/>their martial arts schools.<p>Kirika pulled off the engagement ring then. She pulled it off, got<br/>out of bed, and threw it into the koi pond.<p>The Ring hadn't understood. Didn't Kirika love Soun? Didn't she<br/>love her daughters? Wasn't she happier as a homemaker? But<br/>when the Ring hesitantly showed Akane the images, Akane<br/>seemed to get excited. She seemed to empathize with her mother to<br/>such an extent that the Ring was afraid it might get thrown into the<br/>pond ~again~.<p>Then the Ring thought about how happy it was to be out of the<br/>pond. But hadn't it been happy their? Didn't it have friends?<br/>Fish and squirrels that loved it? But the Ring wasn't supposed to be an<br/>enchanted rock in a fish pond. The Ring was meant to be around<br/>someone's finger. The ring was supposed to shine and be beautiful<br/>and loved and make others feel beautiful and loved. It had been<br/>denied its destiny.<p>Just as it had denied Kirika's destiny.<p>The Ring would have wept had it the biology necessary to do so.<br/>Instead, all it could do was vow that it would never make the<br/>mistake again. It could not bear to be without a wearer again. It<br/>would help Akane out as much as possible, but only with her<br/>permission.<p>So it had asked first before telling Akane where her mother was.<br/>Although the Ring did not know the exact location, it could feel<br/>the woman's particular personality pattern in a certain direction.<br/>The Ring hadn't expected Akane to get so excited after asking her<br/>if she wanted to see her mother. It thought the family knew she<br/>was gone already, but apparently Kirika had gone through great<br/>pains to fake her death.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>At the moment, the Tendos and Ranma were all gathered around<br/>the table sipping tea. Nabiki and Akane were in pajamas, Ritsuko<br/>and Kasumi in housedresses, Ranma in her red Chinese shirt and<br/>black pants, and Soun in his typical brown gi. A toothbrush stuck<br/>out of the corner of his mouth as he listened to Akane's account of<br/>what the Ring had told her. He hadn't really blinked since she had<br/>started and he seemed to be in an advanced state of catatonia, but<br/>otherwise he seemed to be taking it well.<p>Nabiki, being the polar opposite of a morning person, looked<br/>particularly disheveled and was trying desperately to keep from<br/>drifting into insurmountable confusion. Just yesterday, her mother<br/>had been a decade dead, communist squirrels and invisible dogs<br/>did not exist, and her elder sister's personality had been the result<br/>of quirky genetics and upbringing and not the direct effect of<br/>contact with a magical artifact. All that changed now. The only<br/>thing that kept her from going over the edge was the thought that<br/>Kasumi ~had~ been a human-sized bigfoot with pink and purple<br/>polka-dotted fur for a good ten years now, and by comparison, the<br/>other things weren't really all that strange.<p>When Akane was finished, Soun finally blinked and took the tooth<br/>brush out of his mouth, placing it absently into his tea cup. "I...I<br/>don't know what to say..." he muttered, "She never called. It's been<br/>ten years...I thought she loved me and that she just changed for my<br/>sake. I mean to tell you the truth, I was glad when her friends from<br/>the gang started coming by to pick her up. I thought she was more<br/>herself then, more the woman I fell in love with...and of course<br/>Kasumi came by to help with the housework around that time...and then..."<p>"But Daddy, we all saw the body. We ~touched~ the body. She<br/>couldn't have faked that. That was real." Nabiki protested. Her<br/>voice was measured and calm, but her eyes held great emotion.<p>"I don't know," Ranma began before turning her cup of tea three<br/>times and sipping from it. After swallowing and smiling her<br/>approval to Kasumi, she continued. "There was this medicine over<br/>in China that could simulate death. Made the body cold to the<br/>touch and everything. It is risky...I mean you're actually dead for<br/>awhile after you take it and you might not get up again afterwards,<br/>but as long as you get the dose right, after a few hours you come<br/>back to life, climb out of your coffin or whatever and everything's<br/>hunky dorey."<p>Soun nodded sagely. "Yes...she could have slipped out before the<br/>incinerator..."<p>"No, Daddy she couldn't have." Nabiki shook her head. "We had a<br/>viewing remember? there wasn't a single moment when Mom<br/>wasn't supervised."<p>"You're right..." Soun's eyes widened. "Gods! What if she was<br/>still alive when they put her in the oven?"<p>Akane, Nabiki, Ranma, Kasumi, and Ritsuko, the squirrel on<br/>Nabiki's shoulder, all looked at Soun with confusion for a moment.<p>There was creaking on the stairs as Genma descended.<p>In his martial arts gi he walked to the refrigerator, opened it, took out<br/>some juice, and drank it direct from the carton.<p>There was a growling noise from Ranma's general direction and<br/>Genma hurriedly put the carton back in the fridge and bolted out<br/>the front entrance, the sound of heavy paws skittering after him.<p>"Oh wait...she's alive ~now~. She couldn't have been in the<br/>incinerator!" Soun announced.<p>Everyone around the table, including Kasumi, nearly fell over in<br/>amazement at Soun's apparent stupidity.<p>"Honestly, Dad, try to keep up, this is about Mom!"<p>"I know, Akane, I'm sorry. Must be getting old heh heh." Soun<br/>scratched the back of his head.<p>"Wait a minute. You're not surprised at this at all..." Nabiki<br/>frowned. Slowly she raised her hand, pointing at her father. "You<br/>know something!"<p>Outside there was a cry of pain and a splash of water. There were a<br/>few barks and weird annoyed-sounding growfing noises.<p>"Well?" Nabiki crossed her arms. "Out with it, Daddy."<p>"Okay, okay! I guess you girls are old enough to know now. Your<br/>mother's not really dead."<p>"That's what I was just ~telling~ you!" Akane protested.<p>"Yes, well your mother and I...we didn't want to go through a long<br/>messy divorce. We thought it would be easier on all of you in the<br/>long run if we just...faked her death."<p>"So...you and Mom staged the whole funeral?"<p>"Yes!" Soun sobbed.<p>Ritsuko's rodent eyes were brimmed with tears, "How romantic!"<br/>she chittered.<p>"Just how is that romantic?" Nabiki asked of the creature on her<br/>shoulder.<p>"It's like Romeo and Juliet! Star-crossed lovers, thrown together<br/>by fate, but destined to live in separate worlds. So Juliet fakes her<br/>death so she can later elope with Romeo without their families<br/>knowing about it. Romeo finds her in the crypt, she wakes up and<br/>they run off to a far off town and live happily ever after!"<p>"Hey!" Akane pointed at the squirrel accusingly, "That's not how<br/>it goes at all!"<p>"Yes it is! I should know; I've heard the story told the same way<br/>verbatim at least twenty times." Ritsuko smoothed the front of her<br/>house dress and rubbed the fur of her ears matter-of-factly. She<br/>turned to Nabiki, "Are there any more potato chips?"<p>Akane looked strange for a moment. "Oh," she said finally,<br/>"Ringu-chan says that she never liked how the original version<br/>ended..." The Ring had of course been the one who first told the<br/>story to the first sentient squirrel.<p>"Pretty well read for a piece of jewelry," Nabiki commented, "And,<br/>no, Ritsuko, there aren't any more potato chips. No payment<br/>without service." Nabiki closed her eyes, swallowed and slowly<br/>opened them again. "Now, Daddy, you were saying about faking<br/>Mom's death?"<p>"It really wasn't hard at all, physically. Just as Ranma said, she<br/>took a pill, it appeared as if she were dead for a while, and then she<br/>woke up. But the funeral was so real! And that last night when she<br/>stepped out of her coffin so gracefully, like an angel...I begged her<br/>to stay, but of course the matter was already decided...I miss her so<br/>much!"<p>A harried looking panda limped into the living room and collapsed,<br/>doing a passable, if somewhat lumpy, impression of a bear skin rug.<p>"Baka," Ranma muttered.<p>"Do you mind explaining to me, Daddy," Nabiki's voice was<br/>startlingly loud as she advanced on her father. "What convoluted<br/>string of illogic led you to believe that letting me think my mother<br/>was DEAD...was somehow better than just getting a divorce? Just<br/>how is it that you thought making me live through a traumatic<br/>experience, giving me nightmares that stayed with me for YEARS,<br/>and making me keep us from being bankrupt while you 'grieved'<br/>was going to be BETTER for me in the long run?"<p>Ranma couldn't help a snicker, "I see now why Pops and you are<br/>such good friends, Tendo-san." Family Honor barked loudly beside<br/>her and she sobered, bowing. "So sorry for being disrespectful<br/>father-in-law."<p>Speaking to Nabiki, Soun put tried to explain "It was your<br/>mother's idea...I..."<p>Akane was too busy lifting a transdimensional mallet high into the<br/>air to hear. "Daddy no BAKA!"<p>A loud thud and a collective wince later, the discussion concerning<br/>Soun's involvement in his wife's escape was effectively over.<p>"Hey," Ranma said over Soun's and Genma's unconscious bodies,<br/>"Shouldn't we be getting ready for school?"<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>"She ~bitchin~ sparkified yo! Check it!" Hanako pointed through<br/>the back window of the minivan at the naked Chinese girl on<br/>roller-skates. Hanako had a very slight frame and wasn't as strong<br/>as some of the other girls, but she made up for it by being both the<br/>foulest and most charismatic member of the gang.<p>Glancing in the rearview, Vicious saw what Hanako meant. The<br/>girl was not only keeping her balance on the skates, she was<br/>actually ~catching up~ to the van! Granted, Vicious was only<br/>going fast enough so that the girl would only suffer a few broken<br/>bones along with massive scarring if she were to fall, but<br/>still...who would have thought that purple was her natural hair<br/>color?<p>"Go faster, Vicious!" one of the girls called out.<p>"Seen, be speedificicious, Missus Vicious!" nodded Hanako.<p>Smiling, Vicious slowly let the speedometer crawl upward well<br/>into the danger zone. If the girl made a mistake now she could die,<br/>but Vicious doubted that that would happen. This was the most fun<br/>she'd had in a long time. The best part was coming up though.<br/>"Red light's by-droppin , Yankers," She told the girls. who now<br/>looked ahead at the stopped traffic with glee.<p>"Seen!" some of them said. "How the Chinkster gonna chug that?"<p>"Specs like we're gonna chug in a tic..." Vicious muttered as she<br/>came to a sudden stop behind a red Daewoo. Almost instantly there<br/>was a loud BANG and a crash sound as the back windshield<br/>impacted with the wheels of the girl's skates and fell inside...along<br/>with the girl.<p>She had landed in the small space in the floorboard just in<br/>front of the rolling door, having passed over two and a half rows of<br/>seats. Everyone stared at her in amazement. She got up from the<br/>floorboard, stooping a little because of the limited height of the van.<br/>She was bleeding from several places but she didn't appear at all<br/>conscious of her injuries or that she was naked. In fact, that was at<br/>best a secondary issue for everyone else at the moment as well.<br/>The primary issue was that the girl had just done something that<br/>none of them would have even attempted to do in their wildest<br/>dreams, and that this girl now seemed to be pissed.<p>"I do not wish to demean your customs," she growled, her eyes<br/>seeming to burn in their sockets, "but if you do not release me now,<br/>I will murder all of you very painfully." She jiggled the chain still<br/>connected to her wrist manacles for emphasis. "Is this clear?"<p>"Eriko, unlock her." Vicious commanded. Eriko was the youngest<br/>member of the gang and was a little too haughty for her own good.<br/>She needed to be knocked down a few pegs.<p>"I ain't chuggin why I gotta do the shit work. I may be shiny but I<br/>ain't tiny." Eriko was referring to her fighting prowess as opposed<br/>to her actual height. She was indeed one of the best fighters in the<br/>gang. Still, she took off her seatbelt, fished in her voluminous skirt<br/>for the keys and unlocked the naked girl's wrists. She got a hard<br/>right into her left eye for her trouble.<p>"I apologize," the naked girl said, cracking her knuckles, "Reflexes."<p>Eriko in severe pain, reeled into the lap of Mariko, who was the<br/>largest and oldest of the gang excluding Vicious and had a scar<br/>running from her temple to the middle of her left cheek Partially<br/>covered by the white mask. "Shove off, Tit-suck," Mariko threatened<br/>evenly and pushed Eriko into the floor board.<p>The light turned green and Vicious started forward, causing the<br/>purple-headed girl to grab the top of the shotgun seat to keep her<br/>balance in the Minivan on her skates. Eriko crawled back to her own<br/>seat muttering a string of curses.<p>Vicious drove in silence for a moment or two before the Chinese<br/>girl spoke again in a barely restrained, menacing tone. "As much<br/>as I appreciate your hospitality, I would very much like to have my<br/>clothing returned to me."<p>"Your clothes are back at the Whammy Burger," Vicious<br/>explained, looking into the girl's eyes in the rearview, "I really<br/>wasn't expecting you to be so talented. One of the girls will lend<br/>you a school uniform, we like to keep them for torturing the boys<br/>that cross us, but first, what is your name?"<p>The girl seemed to relax just a little, like a snake concealing its<br/>fangs, but still prepared to strike. "My name is Shan Pu, Amazon<br/>warrior and great grand daughter of Ku Lon."<p>"Amazon?" Hanako asked as she started rummaging through the<br/>uniforms in the back "But don't China got a ditch-the-bitch<br/>policy?"<p>Flicking on the turn signal, Vicious turned into the Furinkan High<br/>School parking lot. "It wouldn't be the only chauvinistic country<br/>with a pocket or two of fatal femmes, seen?" Stopping in front of<br/>the school building, Vicious waited for Eriko to pull herself<br/>together and get out of the van while Hanako gave Shampoo the<br/>clothes. After Shampoo had everything, Hanako exited the van,<br/>waving goodbye.<p>"I'll have to let you off here," Vicious told the Amazon. You just<p>go down Furinkan Street and then turn right a block from Tofu's<br/>clinic."<p>By the time Vicious was done with the directions, Shampoo was<br/>dressed. It was strange how normal she looked in the uniform. She<br/>even had glue socks and regulation shoes. It was hard to believe<br/>the same outfit had last been worn by a freshman boy who had<br/>"forgotten" to pay Hanako back on a loan.<p>"This is satisfactory," Shampoo nodded, and slid the side door<br/>open.<p>"Sorry about...all that," Vicious waved at the broken rear<br/>windshield, "but you did break our window."<p>"I understand," Shampoo actually smiled, "I worried before that all<br/>Japanese women were weak. I am glad to have been proven<br/>wrong." With that she stepped onto the asphalt. She paused for a<br/>moment, seeming to stare intently at a young red-headed girl in a<br/>pig-tail and Chinese clothes. "Ranma!" She started waving and<br/>running toward the girl.<p>But the black-haired girl in the uniform that walked with her, the<br/>one with the sour expression on her face, she looked straight at<br/>Vicious through the windshield, and her expression changed to one<br/>of excitement. Vicious felt a wave of vertigo, it was almost as if<br/>she was looking into a mirror of herself some twenty years ago.<br/>She couldn't hear what the girl was saying but it looked an awful<br/>lot like "Mom!"<p>"Mariko, close the door!" Vicious commanded and, putting the van<br/>into gear, she squealed out of the parking lot and into the street.<p>There was no denying that girl was Akane, her youngest daughter.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Ranma couldn't believe her eyes. Her friend from China, whom<br/>she'd thought she'd never see ever again, was here, in Japan, at<br/>Furinkan. It was like she had risen from the grave or something...<p>"Mom!" Akane called out beside her, staring at the woman driving<br/>the black minivan that Shampoo got out of who appeared to be<br/>wearing some sort of face mask. Ranma did a double take: Akane's<br/>mom...Shampoo. A triple take: Shampoo... Akane's mom. Akane's<br/>Mom was driving ~Shampoo~ to school?<p>Ranma was interrupted from her brief confusion by Shampoo's<br/>exuberant embrace. It was a glomp really, but Ranma returned it<br/>heartily, laughing. "It's been so long, Shampoo! How did you get<br/>here? Are you going to school at Furinkan too? This is so cool! I<br/>missed you, you know. I thought I'd never see you again. Gods!"<p>Shampoo's strong arms continued to squeeze Ranma, her long<br/>silken hair brushing against her cheek. Ranma heard a small sound,<br/>a wet intake of breath, barely perceptible really, but she pushed<br/>Shampoo gently away by her shoulders, "What's wrong,<br/>Shampoo?"<p>Ranma could tell she was trying not to cry. "It...it's nothing,"<br/>Shampoo said. "I just so happy am here! I mean...I'm...so glad to<br/>see you!"<p>Just then there was a loud screeching as the minivan sped<br/>recklessly out of the parking lot and into traffic, narrowly avoiding<br/>a collision with a white Cresta sedan, the bald headed man in glasses who<br/>drove it raising his fist and yelling ineffectually. Akane chased<br/>after the van. "Mom!" She yelled. "Mom! I'm here! We know<br/>you're not dead, come back!"<p>Shampoo raised an eyebrow. "Missus Vicious is her mother?"<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow of her own, "Her name is Missus Vicious?"<p>~~~~~*~~~~~~<p>Eriko was at the gate when Nabiki, Ranma and Akane walked in.<br/>Eriko was one of Nabiki's muscle for those special cases when it<br/>was needed. She was a little kooky, always wearing long dresses<br/>over military fatigues and combat boots, bleaching her hair blond,<br/>and wearing face masks. She and Hanako were both part of some<br/>silly gang of violent girls. Unlike Hanako, Eriko's bleach job never<br/>reached her roots and the light and dark contrast in her hair made<br/>her seem much earthier than her fellow gang member. Eriko also<br/>had more bulk, having the wiry strength and poise of an athlete,<br/>while Hanako was almost frail and much smaller despite being a year<br/>older. Both of them could be really weird at times, but Nabiki<br/>didn't care, just as long as they did their job.<p>Eriko was one of those people who were so reckless it was<br/>impressive. Like today she had a massive black eye that was so<br/>swollen Nabiki was sure she couldn't see out of it. To get in a fight<br/>so early in the day...maybe it was a little ~too~ reckless...<p>"I can't use you today, Eriko." Nabiki said simply in place of any<br/>sort of greeting.<p>"What you mean, Biki? You got a spare b-guard hidden in your<br/>uniform?"<p>"I have other ~assistants~, Eriko. And my ~assistants~ cannot<br/>help me if people think they can't hold their own in a fight."<p>"You talking bout this?" Eriko pointed to her eye, "But this ain't<br/>fight make-up! Some huge ass Amazonion Chinky bitchlet from<br/>Hell got pissed and just wailed without warning!"<p>"I don't really care ~how~ you got that black eye. It's bad for<br/>business. Come back when it's healed." Nabiki walked past the<br/>Yankii girl.<p>"Come ~on~, I ain't even ~feelin~ it!" Eriko protested to Nabiki's<br/>back.<p>Ahead of Nabiki Hanako approached, yelling out casually, "Oh<br/>don't be panty-twistin, 'Riko. She's just givin ya a fuck-me-up is<br/>all." Hanako could have passed for a Junior high student. A good<br/>four or five centimeters shorter than Ranma's girl side, she looked<br/>like the sweetest little girl you could care to meet...until she opened<br/>her mouth that is. Unlike Eriko, she took her face mask off in<br/>school, and did find occasion to speak normally from time to time.<br/>"Everyone knows a black eye is more impressive. Means you're<br/>not afraid to get in a tussle. Ain't that right, Bikikins?"<p>Nabiki nodded slowly. She had to keep an eye on Hanako even<br/>more than her gang buddy. The girl was sharp...Nabiki often used<br/>her on the more complicated blackmailing schemes...but she had<br/>her own agenda and it was a little like playing with fire... while<br/>sitting next to a gas station.<p>"Hey there's a squirrel on your shoulder, wearing a house dress,"<br/>Hanako pointed out, "Let me get it off for ya." She picked up a<br/>stone.<p>"That won't be necessary," Nabiki said, "Hanako, Eriko, this is my<br/>newest espionage expert, Ritsuko. Go easy on her, okay?"<p>"Hi there!" Ritsuko waved in a large circular motion. "I would just<br/>like to say that I sympathize with the frustrations of the proletariat<br/>and I fully support your rebellion."<p>"On second thought," Nabiki said, "Go ahead and hit her."<p>Hanako grinned and let loose with the stone, thwacking Ritsuko in<br/>the head. "Ow!" Ritsuko exclaimed. "That wasn't very nice!"<p>The three of them walked for a time, Nabiki filling the two gang<br/>members in on the pertinent information: new student that changes<br/>sexes, talking squirrel, Akane more on edge than usual, on account<br/>of her recently having to deal with a piece of jewelry that had a<br/>nasty habit of controlling people's minds... the usual thing really.<br/>When they approached the parking lot on the way to the assistant<br/>principal's office, where Ranma would be registering for classes,<br/>they ran into Akane, Ranma and another girl talking animatedly<br/>about something.<p>"That's the bitchlet, thereways!" Eriko pointed.<p>"You mean the huge Chinese Amazon you were talking about?"<br/>Nabiki asked.<p>"Seen!"<p>"Is she hiding behind the bubbly, purple-haired schoolgirl?"<p>"She is the bubbly, purple-haired schoolgirl," Hanako explained,<br/>"Only she ain't bubbly...or a schoolgirl. We gave her some spare<br/>clothes after she owned us righteously."<p>"Never chugged her for a lesbo," Eriko mused. "Shoulda sussed it<p>mayhap." She was referring to the way the girl was fawning over<br/>Ranma, staring at the pigtailed girl with eyes all googly and taking<br/>advantage of any excuses to touch her.<p>"The red-head is Saotome, the one I was telling you about. The one<br/>who changes sexes." Nabiki explained.<p>"Ohhhh." Eriko and Hanako enthused.<p>They were close enough to hear what the group was saying now.<br/>Akane had just finished insisting vehemently that "There's no way<br/>my mother would call herself something as stupid as 'Missus<br/>Vicious!'"<p>All three of them stopped dead in their tracks. "Shit cakes on high<br/>heat, Biki! Missus Vicious is your ~mother~?" Hanako exclaimed.<p>"I certainly hope not," Nabiki sighed.<p>"Now that I chug on it, ya do smack of the Missus..."<p>Nabiki purposefully ignored Eriko and rushed toward Ranma,<br/>hoping for a distraction. "Hey, Saotome, who's your friend?"<p>"Oh hey, Nabs, this is Shampoo, my friend from China. She's an<br/>Amazon. Go easy on her. Shampoo, this is Tendo Nabiki, and the<br/>angry girl with the long black hair is Tendo Akane, her younger<br/>sister."<p>Akane glanced briefly down at Shampoo's breasts and sniffed.<br/>"They aren't that big."<p>Hanako gasped. "Fuck me Amadeus! If you spec her face, Akane<br/>looks almost exactly like her!"<p>Nabiki closed her eyes and took a breath. "Okay, time out, people.<br/>Let me get this straight. Ranma's friend from China is the same<br/>person who beat up the gang of the people who work for me and<br/>they dropped her off here, where Ranma just happened to be going<br/>to register. Furthermore the leader of this gang, the gang my two<br/>associates have belonged to for the past five years, is actually my<br/>mother, who's been dead for a decade?"<p>Ranma nodded, "Seems like that sums it up..."<p>Nabiki pulled out a calculator from her bookbag and started<br/>punching buttons, a somewhat crazed look in her eyes. "Let's<br/>see...faked death...unlikely chance meeting...cosmic irony...yes,<br/>this should be the odds of all this occurring at once."<p>Looking over Nabiki's shoulder Hanako pointed at the calculator's<br/>display. "Hey, isn't that your telephone number?"<p>Ranma giggled and started singing. "Ohhh! It's a small world after<br/>all! Iiiit's a small world after all! Iiiit's a small world after<br/>all; it's a small, small world!"<p>Without any potato chips on her person, Nabiki did what any<br/>sensible person would do in her situation...<p>She passed out.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Vicious drove the minivan into the construction yard. She was<br/>alone with Mariko, as she had just finished dropping off the two<br/>other girls, Toko and Hoko, at the homeless shelter, where they<br/>were doing their community service. If you asked Vicious, she'd<br/>say the law took aggravated assault way too seriously. Still the<br/>community service was probably good for the girls. They weren't<br/>that far away from being homeless themselves after all, and it<br/>might inspire them to do better in school.<p>Mariko and Vicious both worked at the construction yard. There<br/>were three main reasons for this. First, women weren't supposed to<br/>work in construction and the Yankii always did what they weren't<br/>supposed to. Secondly, Vicious and Mariko both had extremely<br/>good upper body strength. Vicious got her strength from her<br/>father's side of the family, Mariko from the steroids she took in<br/>Junior High. Finally, without college degrees, what else were they<br/>going to do? Work as office ladies? That would be even worse than<br/>being married!<p>Mariko was silent throughout the trip from the shelter. She was<br/>some twelve years younger than Vicious, though with her harsh,<br/>almost masculine features and her somber expression, she seemed<br/>about the same age. She never really talked much, and most the<br/>time that didn't bother Vicious, but on the way to the yard,<br/>Mariko's reticence was more oppressive. It was the silence of<br/>someone being silent because they have something to say.<p>When Vicious parked and was getting out of the van, Mariko finally<br/>spoke. "I'm quitting the Yankii," she said.<p>Vicious paused, swallowed and leaned into the van to see Mariko's<br/>face, her own face suddenly drained of color.<p>Mariko took her mask off, fully exposing the scar that ran along<br/>her cheek and revealing her startlingly full lips. "I'm sick of all this<br/>shit. I want out."<p>Vicious wanted to hear what Mariko said again, to be sure what she was<br/>hearing was real. But she had always found it inane for people to ask<br/>"what?" or "what do you mean?" or "huh?" and any number of variations<br/>thereof when they already knew perfectly well what the other person<br/>said and what they meant. They were cop out expressions. Autonomous<br/>responses to stimuli. So instead, Vicious closed her eyes, breathed,<br/>and accepted what she heard. One of her best friends was going<p>to leave her.<p>She sat back in the driver's seat, because she didn't feel up to<br/>standing. After a few moments filled with the sound of rivets and<br/>banging and yelling of the world outside the minivan and nothing<br/>else, Vicious asked simply. "Why?"<p>"I was sixteen when I joined. I used to look up to you. All the rest<br/>of the world was shit, but when the Yankii were at your<br/>house...you didn't judge us or nothing. You just took care of us.<br/>When you left your kids...dammit I thought that was the stupidest<br/>thing I heard. We all did. But we didn't say nothing. We didn't<br/>want to lose you. We didn't want you to leave us like you left them.<p>"I know you got mind fucked. I know you didn't ask for none of<br/>that, but whatever happened, you became a mom. First to your kids,<br/>and then to all of us." Mariko turned her face away from Vicious<br/>and looked out of the window.<p>"I'm twenty-five now. I ain't into stupid shit like torturing tourists<br/>no more. I keep thinking bout you and your kids...I keep thinking<br/>how you got something really precious and you're letting it slip<br/>away. And I look at myself... at what the Yankii done for me, and<br/>all I really got to show for it is this scar. That and maybe knowing<br/>you." Mariko rolled the side door back and stepped out onto the<br/>sunny dust-covered asphalt.<p>"I'm just sick of all the shit, like I said. You can have the girls beat<br/>my ass tomorrow. Just one thing..." She turned to face Vicious<br/>directly through the doorway. "I want you to deal the first blow.<br/>I'm asking that as a friend."<p>The sound of riveting filled the silence as Kirika nodded. She<br/>wasn't feeling very vicious at all at the moment. With a slam of the<br/>door, Mariko was gone, and she was alone in the van. Just her and<br/>the reflection in the rear view mirror of the gaping hole that was<br/>once the rear windshield.<p>She couldn't help but think about Akane, Nabiki, even Kasumi<br/>whom she only knew for a year or two before she left. She couldn't<br/>help but think of Soun and how devoted he was to her.<p>She would have to go to Jiro's Garage tomorrow and get a<br/>replacement for the rear windshield, maybe for the whole back<br/>door. It might take several days and in that time there wouldn't be<br/>any easy way to transport the girls. Still it would be fixed. What<br/>Kirika didn't know was how to fix the gaping hole in her soul.<p>She shook her head free of the silly thought and got out of the van.<br/>That was just leftovers from the mind control talking. She was<br/>Missus Vicious, and she had work to do.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>"Stop calling her that! Her name is Kirika!" Akane yelled at<br/>Hanako, who had just for the fifth time remarked on how similar<br/>she looked to her mother. Akane, Hanako, Eriko, the unconscious<br/>Nabiki and Ritsuko were all outside in the school courtyard while<br/>Ranma and Shampoo were getting registered. It was strange, but as<br/>far as Akane could tell, as soon as Shampoo had seen Ranma, the<br/>Amazon realized she had always wanted to be part of the Japanese<br/>public school system.<p>Akane hadn't realized how early she had gotten to school. She<br/>usually avoided it until the last minute and then tried to blame<br/>being late on Nabiki or some unforeseen circumstance that she<br/>knew about ahead of time. Usually, the stupid boys were already<br/>there, waiting for her to pound them into the dirt, but now she had<br/>to wait for them. Uncaring perverted bastards the lot of them. They<br/>were really going to get it now!<p>"Righto, I getcha, truly. No need to go all fire-engine red on me."<br/>Hanako held her thin hands up in a placating gesture. "I just can't<br/>believe I never sussed it before. I mean, shitpickles, I was just<br/>telling Eriko here the other day that you'd be a perfect yankii..."<p>"She ain't joshin ya. Just t'other day she spurted that very thing."<br/>Eriko nodded.<p>"Just shut up! Both of you! I am not now, nor will I ever be, part of<br/>your stupid gang. And why can't you just talk normally? Honestly!"<p>Eriko thinned her eyes, "Hey the yankii ain't stupid, and if you<br/>spurt that chum again, Vicious' daughter or no, I'll glove you. No<br/>diff to me."<p>"What did she say?" Akane asked Hanako, confused.<p>"Oh, she was just saying that if you called us stupid again she was<br/>going to stick her fist so far up your ass she'd be able to move your<br/>arms and legs with her fingers," Hanako offered, helpfully,<br/>beaming up at Akane. She made a hole with her right thumb and<br/>forefinger and shoved her left hand upward through it, waggling<br/>the digits. "You know, like a glove."<p>"Oh that's just sick!" Ritsuko said. Up until now she had been<br/>alternating between fanning Nabiki with a piece of notebook paper<br/>and looking surreptitiously around for potato chip crumbs. "You're<br/>such a cute girl, why must you be so crude? Besides that's<br/>physically impossible anyway."<p>In a flash, Hanako had Ritsuko by the tail, the squirrel dangling in<br/>the air from her fingers, her dress up-turned, almost covering her<br/>small head. "I suppose you'd like a demonstration?"<p>Akane's estimation of the smaller girl's skill had risen greatly.<br/>Hanako didn't look like much... not near as strong as<br/>Akane, but ~damn~ she was fast.<p>"Put me down, Hanako-chan! Hurting me won't do anything to<br/>ease your feelings of inferiority."<p>Hanako's thin, unbleached black eyebrow twitched. "Mayhap it<br/>won't, mayhap it will."<p>Ritsuko looked panicked for a moment as Hanako glared<br/>menacingly at her. Finally, as if shaking herself from a trance,<br/>Hanako lightly tossed the squirrel back onto Nabiki's blouse.<p>That was when they started to show.<p>First was the Karate club, followed closely by Judo with one or<br/>two Sumo waddling behind. Then some of the more violent groups<br/>showed.<p>The Chemistry club looked suspiciously smug today, their glasses<br/>gleaming with evil intent.<p>The male members of the Furinkan dance club, all two of them,<br/>pirouetted menacingly in the shadow of a laughing statue.<p>A cadre of tennis enthusiasts unsheathed their rackets from their<br/>zippered cases, resolute that this day they would spill the blood of<br/>tomboy.<p>The Jazz band, led by a saxophone player in a tweed jacket,<br/>polished and fine-tuned their instruments of torture, preparing to<br/>blare their supersonic notes of death until their quarry crumpled in<p>submission at their feet.<p>From almost every facet of school life they came. Different as they<br/>were from one another, they were united by a common goal, and<br/>all were sure that today they would not be thwarted, today they<br/>would stand victorious and all others would bow before them in<br/>deference to their greatness. Almost as one, they ceased their<br/>sounds of preparation and stared stonily at their destiny.<p>The minute hand on the clock tower jittered as if in anticipation,<br/>and then finally clicked into place. At exactly 8:25 AM the armies<br/>sang out their battle cries.<p>"AKANE, I LOVE YOU!"<p>"I HATE BOYS!"<p>And the multitudes slammed against Akane with all the power of<br/>an island village against a hurricane.<p>The boys were, of course, prepared for some level of violence. In<br/>point of fact, many, if not most of them went through the ritual so<br/>that after receiving whatever debilitating blow the young Tendo<br/>dished out, they would be coddled by their girlfriends and maybe<br/>have their first sexual experience. Sure this was pretty dumb and<br/>yes, many girls were not in the least bit impressed. On the other<br/>hand, hardly any of these girls had boyfriends. It was a self-<br/>propagating system for which Akane was merely the catalyst.<p>Unfortunately the boys had picked a bad time to engage in their<br/>bizarre mating ritual, because this time there were two other card<br/>carrying tomboys at Akane's side, and both were itching for a fight.<p>It wasn't pretty.<p>Bodies flew, blood spilled, teeth launched out of mouths...Several<br/>of the boys found themselves twisted into positions they could not<br/>get out of. The sound of cracking bones, of exploding concrete, of<br/>ear-splitting high C's, of the screams with flesh pounding<br/>accompaniment, filled the air like marijuana at a rock concert.<p>By 8:27, the battle ground had already become a wasteland<br/>peppered with groaning half-dead participants. The dust settled and<br/>three girls remained standing, breathing heavily and smiling.<p>"Cunnilingus crabcakes!" Hanako said, "That was the best fight<br/>I've had in months!"<p>"Seen," Eriko nodded. "Gonna hafta head schoolwards more often,<br/>ere this keeps up."<p>"I didn't need your help." Akane grimaced.<p>"Help? What help?" Hanako asked, "We saw a fight starting and<br/>joined in to kick some ass. 'Sides you can't keep this to yourself<br/>anymore now that we know you're Vicious' daughter. You're a<br/>yankii by default, you ken?"<p>"No...I'm Akane..." Akane said, confused as she made her way<br/>over the unconscious bodies toward the school. The two yankii<br/>girls followed alongside her.<p>Hanako laughed, "Nah I knew that. I was asking if you kenned me.<br/>You know as in understand?"<p>"Gods! What happened here?" Ranma said as he and Shampoo<br/>entered the scene. Ranma had changed into male form for the<br/>edification of the assistant principal, who did not know of<br/>Jusenkyo curses. The assistant principal, Washi-san was his name,<br/>agreed that it was best that Ranma be registered as a girl despite<br/>what it said on his birth certificate. Genma would have screwed up<br/>the registration somehow if Ranma had let him do it, but as it was<br/>it went relatively smoothly for him.<p>Shampoo, on the other hand, had a few problems. She had snuck<br/>on board a cargo ship from Peking to get to Japan. She had no<br/>passport, no ID. She essentially did not exist. It took a lot of<br/>convincing both on her part and on Ranma's to get Washi-san to<br/>agree to enroll Shampoo, and only then on the condition that she<br/>get the necessary paperwork by the time the current term was over,<br/>which was in three months.<p>When they left the office, they heard the sounds of fighting and ran<br/>out to see what was going on. Ranma had completely forgotten to<br/>change back into his girl form.<p>"We took care of it," Akane said tersely.<p>Ranma surveyed the damage. He went to one of the fallen, a jazz<br/>band member, and winced in sympathy as the boy attempted to<br/>remove a trumpet from a private place. Ranma couldn't really tell<br/>if it was a trumpet for sure...he could just about make out the<br/>mouth piece... "You don't think you went a bit too far?"<p>"Measure once, cut twice, that's our motto, hot boy." Hanako<br/>replied. "You really that red-head from before?"<p>Ranma nodded. He looked back at Akane, "You know just because<br/>your mother's the leader of their gang, you don't have to join<br/>them."<p>Akane's eyes narrowed in anger. "I can do whatever I want, you<br/>freak!"<p>Ranma shook his head, "These are just kids, Akane! Most of them<br/>probably haven't practiced the Art once in their entire lives! Even<br/>if they were all attacking you, you didn't have to be this brutal."<p>A low growling emanated from Ranma's side.<p>Shampoo placed a hand on Ranma's shoulder. "The girl is<br/>unskilled. No doubt she knows nothing of pressure points or<br/>simple knock out blows. It is likely this is the only way she saw to<br/>defeat her attackers."<p>"~She knows better,~" Ranma contested in Mandarin. "~She did<br/>this out of false pride~."<p>"~Then nothing will come of lowering her self esteem~," Shampoo<br/>replied.<p>Ranma nodded slowly, "You're right. I wasn't seeing the big<br/>picture." Turning to Akane he put his hands together and bowed. "I<br/>apologize. I judged you without knowing the whole situation. If<br/>you could just explain to me what happened, maybe I could<br/>understand."<p>"You don't need to understand," Akane shot back. "You're just an<br/>unwanted house guest. I hardly know you. You're just as bad as<br/>Kuno, you think you're so much better than everyone else, so<br/>much more honorable. I've heard it all before, you pervert. And<br/>I'm not taking it anymore, you hear me?"<p>Ranma frowned. "Who's Kuno?"<p>"He's a royal stick in the ass," Hanako said.<p>Nabiki joined the group, rubbing her forehead. "Are you talking<br/>about Kuno-chan?" She looked around at the aftermath of today's<br/>battle and grimaced. Looking to Ranma she explained, "Yes, this is<br/>all more or less his fault. He thought Akane was too much of a<br/>tomboy and challenged her to get her to stop fighting people.<br/>When Akane won, he went off the deep end. During a speech<br/>competition he declared that if anyone wanted to date Akane,<br/>they'd have to defeat her in combat. He claimed this was to get her<br/>to stop fighting, but of course it didn't work. No one was able to<br/>defeat her. Kuno sort of developed a crush on her since then, or<br/>maybe he always had it, but now he fights her just so she'll go out<br/>with him. Kind of sad really." Nabiki stretched her arms over her<br/>head and let them fall to her sides. "Understand that I would have<br/>charged you for that if I wasn't afraid your friend Fido was going<br/>to use my little sister as a chew toy."<p>"Her name's Family Honor," Ranma corrected.<p>"Yeah...I know. It's a...never mind" Nabiki waved it off. "Anyway<br/>it's nothing to worry about. We just have a lot of masochists at our<br/>school."<p>"Masochism, huh?" Ranma said. "I never understood that. I mean<br/>why would someone willingly subject themselves to a beating just<br/>because they like a girl?"<p>"There are many boys like that in my village," Shampoo nodded,<br/>"I find them completely devoid of intelligence."<p>Ranma suspected Shampoo was thinking of one boy in particular,<br/>but he knew better than to mention the name.<p>"Maybe if you'd ever been in love, you'd understand!" Akane<br/>snapped.<p>"Akane, you know I love your older sister very much..." Ranma<br/>said crossing his arms.<p>"No you don't! You can't! You've only known her for what, a<br/>day? You're just using her so you and your stupid panda father and<br/>your rabid dog can freeload off us!"<p>Before Ranma could say anything, there was a blur of motion and<br/>Akane snatched something out of the air. A rose. She threw it to<br/>the ground. "Kuno," She seethed.<p>Dark clouds came in from behind the clock tower of the school<br/>"The toll of the bell at the temple of Gion shows us the transience<br/>of it all." A figure walked toward them, dressed in hakama, an<br/>unsheathed sword in its right hand. "And the color of the blossoms<br/>on the trees demonstrates that all which prospers must someday<br/>decline." The figure resolved itself in front of Akane into that of a<br/>tall, teenage boy, his hair thick and black over his blue eyes, he<br/>seemed at once more mature than his age, and by virtue of his<br/>costume, more childish. He closed his eyes and laughed. "Such a<br/>boorish lot, truly. Evidently each of them thought to date with you.<br/>On the dawn of the day they finally defeated you that is." Thunder<br/>rolled overhead.<p>Nabiki snuck away toward the school were she wouldn't be as<br/>likely to get rained on or accidentally cleaved in two by a stray hit<br/>of Kuno's bokken.<p>"They should learn their limitations," Kuno continued.<p>"Get out of my way, Kuno," Akane said, "I'm not in the mood<br/>right now." She attempted to pass him, but he blocked the way<br/>with his wooden sword.<p>"Well then, Tendo Akane," He swung the sword gracefully into a<br/>ready position. "Will you spar with me?" Kuno apparently couldn't<br/>hear too well with his eyes closed as they were.<p>"Hey! Let her pass, Dickweed!" Hanako yelled.<p>"Seen. Else we gonna do some gardening." Eriko nodded.<p>"This is my fight, okay? Stay out of it." Akane got into a ready<br/>stance.<p>"This is the guy who made the challenge huh?" Ranma nodded to<br/>Kuno, his arms still crossed. His invisible dog began to growl<br/>again beside him.<p>"Leave Family Honor out of this!" Akane yelled. "He wants a<br/>spar," She leveled her gaze at the would-be samurai, "he'll get<br/>one."<p>Kuno opened his eyes, he pointed his bokken at Ranma. "You<br/>there! Aren't you being awfully familiar with Akane-kun?"<p>"My apologies for not introducing myself," Ranma bowed. "My<br/>name's Saotome Ranma of the Anything Goes School of Martial<br/>Arts. I'm engaged to Akane's sister, which is how I know Akane. I<br/>would like to make a formal challenge to you, but not just yet.<br/>Family Honor would not be satisfied if I attacked under the current<br/>circumstances. If you will permit me, I and my colleague here,"<br/>Ranma gestured to Shampoo, "will continue on to our classes."<p>"Very well, you may pass, but know that I, the rising star of the<br/>world of fencing, captain of the Furinkan Kendo club, Junior in<br/>class E, with strength beyond measure, and a voice that can silence<br/>a crying child, whose peers call him the Blue Thunder!" A flash of<br/>lightening arced behind the boy as he held his sword pointed<br/>toward the heavens. "...I, Kuno Tatewaki, age seventeen will be<br/>awaiting your challenge, and when we next meet you shall taste<br/>defeat."<p>"Hey, that rhymed!" Ranma said.<p>"Of course," replied Kuno. "Every word I speak is poetry."<p>"Um...right..." Ranma turned to Eriko and Hanako, "You'll take<br/>care of Akane if she gets hurt?"<p>"Yeah, we ain't gonna babysit her or nothing but we'll haul her off<br/>if she needs hauling," Hanako nodded.<p>"Fine," Ranma turned back to Kuno and Akane. Bowing to both of<br/>them he said, "I wish you both glory in the coming battle," and left.<p>"~I wonder how long it will be before they are joined~." Shampoo<br/>said in Mandarin.<p>"~Akane and that boy with the stick? Never would be my guess~,"<br/>Ranma replied.<p>"~I just know how easily hate can turn into love~."<p>"Heh. I suppose you're right. I mean you used to hate me and now<br/>we're best friends!"<p>Shampoo smiled slightly, trying not to look too wistful. "Yes," she<br/>said. "Friends."<p>The first patters of rain began to fall and Ranma stood in front of<br/>the doorway long enough for the curse to activate. A girl once,<br/>more Ranma looked up at Shampoo and smiled. "I'm glad you're<br/>here, Shampoo. I missed you."<p>And with that, they both went inside.<p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~<p>I borrowed a bit from other series with this one. The yankii I got<br/>from Fruits Basket though I don't plan on making an official cross<br/>in this fic. I'm almost positive that the real Yankii, (if there is such<br/>a thing and it isn't just a name for a kind of person on the same level<br/>as "goth" in the US would be) are completely different from how I<br/>depict them here. If this fic reflects reality in any way I'll be<br/>shocked:-)<p>When Shampoo first meets the Yankii Eriko calls her "chinpoko-<br/>jin." Now, I really try to keep my Japanese use to a minimum but<br/>sometimes I can't help myself. "Chinpoko" is, as any student of<br/>South Park knows, Japanese for penis. Literally Chinpoko-jin<br/>would mean "penis person" but it sounds a lot like Chugoku-jin,<br/>which means "Chinese person." Initially the Yankii have just as<br/>much prejudice against the Chinese as Shampoo does against the<br/>Japanese in this fic.<p>A good bit of the Yankii accent I lifted from Tad Williams's<br/>Otherland series, and Mr Williams deserves credit for making<br/>some truly awesome characters there. I altered the accent a bit, and<br/>I might have gone over board, but it was fun.<p>Finally, there was an obscure reference to GTO, which is of course<br/>one of the greatest anime in the universe and it's creators also<br/>deserve credit; so I'm giving it here.<p>C&amp;C would be greatly appreciated.
