</div>Family Honor<br/>A Ranma ½ fanfic by Zorknot<br/>Chapter 1: The Flight of Akane Tendo<p>DISCLAIMER: These characters and some situations are owned<br/>by Takahashi Rumiko and the Army of the Undead and not by me.<br/>If everything about Ranma were to be made into a movie, I'd be an<br/>extra with a very short screen time. Maybe not even that. You<br/>know that scene where some guy is selling bread to a girl with a<br/>panda balloon in the first episode? My best friend's second cousin<br/>knows a guy who played bingo with him once. Though if you ask<br/>me, I think he made it up.<p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~<p>Saotome Genma trudged along the road. So far this evening he had<br/>been insulted, beat up, rained on, and generally humiliated and<br/>things weren't exactly looking up. He wished he hadn't told<br/>Ranma anything. That he had just kept the engagement to a Tendo<br/>daughter a secret until they were almost there. But Family Honor<br/>demanded that he tell Ranma why all of a sudden they were headed<br/>for some place in Japan instead of looking for a cure in China. Of<br/>course Ranma hadn't liked how Genma kept it a secret from him<br/>all these years...<p>Say what you will about sons exceeding their fathers, but Genma<br/>wasn't particularly pleased at being beaten so thoroughly by<br/>someone he'd seen in diapers.<p>Genma's whole body ached.<p>He would feel better in a day or two, once he had some rest, but<br/>right now he was wondering if there might be hidden benefits to<br/>ritualistic suicide he hadn't previously considered. Right now he<br/>was a panda, and his son was a red-headed girl, and a trip that<br/>should have taken all of twenty minutes was taking some four<br/>hours.<p>"Hey, look at it from MY perspective, Pop," The redhead, argued.<br/>She was wearing a kimono that was several sizes too large, her<br/>hands completely covered by the sleeves. She also carried a very<br/>large backpack. She was drenched from the short shower that<br/>passed by half an hour ago, but she seemed unfazed by it. She was<br/>walking extremely slowly, and Genma really just wanted to get to<br/>the Tendos' so he could sit down and relax. "I thought we were<br/>going back home to see Mom." Ranma continued, "Instead I find<br/>out you want me to be engaged to someone I don't even know. Of<br/>course I'm going to be a little upset."<p>"Growf." Genma said impatiently, waiting for Ranma to catch up.<p>The girl reached the panda again making her small, leisurely steps.<br/>She looked up at him. "I know it's for Family Honor. But wouldn't<br/>Family Honor be satisfied if we stayed with Mom?" The<br/>capitalization on the words "family honor" was audible. Several of<br/>the older folk, who had seen stranger things than pandas walk<br/>down the streets of Nerima, nodded with respect. They could see<br/>family honor was something Ranma valued very much.<p>They didn't know the half of it.<p>"Growf," was Genma's answer to Ranma's question. He tried to<br/>convey that the issue was settled and not to pursue it anymore.<p>Ranma looked past her father at a ramshackle vending booth run<br/>by a young girl and her mother. "Oh look! They're selling kittens!<br/>Aren't they cute?" As Ranma passed, the kittens suddenly scurried<br/>behind their mother, who started hissing.<p>Genma raised a forepaw to its head and buried his furry forehead<br/>in it. He realized he had moved a good bit ahead of his child and<br/>stopped so Ranma could catch up again. "GROWF!" he barked<br/>impatiently.<p>"Ah, come on, Pop. You never let me play with the cats!" The<br/>Panda's eyebrow or rather, the top of his eye patch, twitched as<br/>Ranma reached him again. "And I'm sorry if I can't keep up with<br/>you, but if I go any faster, this kimono will be ruined. I am going<br/>to be engaged after all aren't I?"<p>Genma started walking hanging his head in shame. Why couldn't<br/>he have a son that was rude, impatient, and insensitive? Why did<br/>he have to take after his mother so damned much?<p>"So tell me something, Pop. Who is it? Do I know the person?"<p>Genma just kept walking. Didn't his son realize he couldn't talk?<p>"Is it a boy or a girl?" Ranma suddenly asked.<p>Genma stopped. He whirled around to see his child, smirking<br/>mischievously at him.<p>Ranma chuckled, "Ha! I got you good, there, Pops! Really, I swear<br/>you have more trouble with my curse than I do!" Ranma walked<br/>on. She watched a blue butterfly flutter in the air above her. She<br/>held out her hand for a perch. The butterfly landed on her finger.<br/>She brought it closed to her face smiling, and then let it go. She<br/>had taken some twenty steps but she was still no more than a meter<br/>away from Genma. "Hey I know what we can do to make the time<br/>go by! Let's sing!"<p>Genma groaned. Ever since they had stopped by that karaoke bar<br/>near the docks, Ranma was under the impression that her girl<br/>side's voice was a wonderful thing she should share with the<br/>world. Admittedly Ranma could sing rather well, the martial arts<br/>breathing techniques giving her lots of breath support, but still...<p>"Yappa pa, yappa pa, ii shan ten!<br/>Unruly love, like the carp, jumps out of its pond!<br/>Yappa pa, yappa pa, ii shan ten!<br/>The ocean breeze from my heart wants you to respond!"<p>Genma briefly considered simply walking the other direction, but<br/>of course he couldn't do that to his son. Besides, Family Honor<br/>wouldn't let him. He clenched his panda jaw as Ranma kept<br/>singing.<p>"My world turns dark, and I don't know why.<br/>Ranma, Ranma, it's all because of you.<br/>Once we met, that began the end.<br/>Ranma, Ranma what<br/>Are we fighting for?<br/>You're the only one to turn my gray skies blue!"<p>Of course Ranma loved this song. It had her name in it. Nevermind<br/>that it was recently voted the most annoying song in Japan...<br/>Genma had to stop her. Any minute now she was going to start<br/>dancing. Genma's eyes drifted to the no parking sign he was<br/>standing next to. He had an idea...<p>"Why can't you just say the words 'I love you'<br/>Without destroying the house with your fists?..."<p>Genma ripped the sign out of the concrete. Just as he feared, his<br/>son turned daughter was swaying and snapping her fingers to the<br/>music that wasn't there.<p>"You know, when you do that, I can't back down.<br/>You know... it makes me...just like you!"<p>Ranma reached up to the sky in grandiose fashion preparing to belt<br/>out her favorite part of the song, the part about the "one-room<br/>apartment of my heart."<p>"OH! You never rang, you just became a part,<br/>Of the one-room..." THUD "URK!"<p>Genma put the sign back into the concrete and slung his<br/>unconscious child onto his shoulder.<p>"Hey that panda just attacked that girl!" one of the onlookers<br/>exclaimed in astonishment.<p>"Yeah thank goodness!" his companion replied, "I didn't think<br/>she'd ever stop!" There were several murmurs of assent.<p>Genma nodded, picked up Ranma's pack and trudged briskly<br/>onward, toward the house of his childhood friend. He hoped he<br/>was doing the right thing...Family Honor was such a tricky thing to<br/>deal with.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>"Um, Daddy? You know I like family time as much as the next<br/>girl, but can we go back to our rooms now? My feet fell asleep<br/>about an hour ago and I want to make sure they're still attached..."<br/>Nabiki, age 17, Soun Tendo's middle daughter asked.<p>Soun had somehow managed to doze off, leaning against the<br/>doorway of the engawa as dusk settled in Nerima. He woke up<br/>with a comical snort at Nabiki's question. "It was the Master, dear<br/>I swear! Huh? Oh... Nabiki, my daughter. Please be patient. My<br/>friend is sure to be here any moment."<p>"Honestly Dad, you said that almost two hours ago!" Akane, age<br/>16, Soun Tendo's youngest daughter argued.<p>"The postcard said he was coming. In all the time I've known him,<br/>Saotome has lied to many, but he always told the truth to me. He is<br/>coming." Soun folded his arms in finality, which would have been<br/>more impressive if he hadn't done the same thing ten times before.<p>"Yes, but Father, did the postcard say *when* the Saotomes would<br/>be coming?" Kasumi, age 19, a pink and purple polka-dotted<br/>pygmy sasquatch with eight arms and a pleasant disposition, asked<br/>politely.<p>"Hmm..." Soun thought seriously about his eldest daughter's<br/>question before answering, "now that you mention it, I don't think<br/>it did!"<p>Akane practically growled, "You mean we've been sitting here all<br/>this time and THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN SHOW UP?"<p>Soun turned back toward the sunset. "I suppose it IS a possibility,"<br/>he admitted. The scene outside was so beautiful he felt inspired...<p>A panda postcard<br/>The sun's red-violet death<br/>I am so happy<p>Soun didn't see the scene behind him of Kasumi using four of her<br/>arms to restrain Akane from committing patricide.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes and stood up unsteadily, stomping her feet<br/>on the floor. There was an odd noise from the front entrance of the<br/>house. "Oooh, that must be Ranma!" Nabiki exclaimed almost not<br/>quite sarcastically. She stomped to the front entrance in her<br/>kimono.<p>Some five seconds later, she came running back into the living<br/>room. Not because she was particularly scared of the large panda<br/>that was making its way into the house; Kasumi, with her eight<br/>arms, primal features, pink fur, and conservative clothing was<br/>scarier that any panda could hope to be. She was running because<br/>the kimono-clad girl on the panda's shoulder was singing THAT<br/>song. Very loudly. And Nabiki wasn't completely certain that she<br/>was going to stop.<p>"Yappa pa, Yappa pa, ryan shan ten!<br/>A stolen kiss from your lips is sunlight in the rain<br/>Yappa pa, Yappa pa, ryan shan ten!<br/>A gust of love, the spice of live, the end of the refrain..."<p>The panda limped up to Soun picked the girl of its shoulder and set<br/>her down in front of him.<p>"So Father," Asked Kasumi, one hand on her father's shoulder,<br/>one hand to her lips in consternation, two others scratching her<br/>sides and the remaining four clasped in front of her apron almost<br/>cutely, "is this your friend?"<p>"Mmm mmm mmm MMM!" Soun shook his head through the<br/>singing.<p>"Every time that you stare at me<br/>Ranma, Ranma things start to spin around..."<br/>Ranma continued the song acting out the meanings of the words in<br/>pantomime.<p>"Oh GODS will someone make the girl stop!" Nabiki groaned.<p>"'I love you' is what I want to hear...<br/>Ranma, Ranma dear-<br/>Wait a minute here!<br/>I thought I wanted to keep my options free!"<br/>Ranma knelt on the ground and raised her hands in fanfare to her<br/>less than impressed audience.<p>"It is somehow appropriate though don't you think?" Kasumi<br/>noted.<p>Soun wondered how it was that this pretty girl in kimono had<br/>befriended a panda and trained it to walk on its hind legs and carry<br/>her around. He also wondered why she had barged into his home<br/>unannounced. Then he remembered his eldest daughter...The girl<br/>no doubt had a long story to tell about both counts. "May I ask<br/>what your name is, miss?"<p>"Oh hi there! Name's Ranma! Saotome Ranma! Go easy on me<br/>kay?" the girl vigorously shook Soun's hand, released him, and<br/>then bowed deeply.<p>"Erm, yes, I am Tendo Soun and this is my family." Soun gestured<br/>to his daughters, "Please...go easy on us as well." Soun spoke<br/>blankly. "Your father wouldn't happen to be Saotome Genma<br/>would he?"<p>"Yep! That's Pop! He's the panda." The girl cocked a thumb in the<br/>rather tired looking panda's direction.<p>Soun was waiting for a good opportunity to faint, but he was too<br/>confused. Genma was the panda?<p>"Look," Ranma said catching the Tendos' confusion, "Family<br/>Honor demands that I must tell all of you a few things, and its best<br/>if I just show you." Ranma looked at her audience for a moment<br/>smiling. "You there, with the pretty pink fur, what's your name?"<p>"Kasumi," the eight-armed pigmy sasquatch replied.<p>"Oh that's a pretty name! How do you do? I was just wondering if<br/>you could get me two cups of water, one steaming hot, the other<br/>cold."<p>"Certainly, Ranma-chan, I'd be happy to!" Kasumi hurried off to<br/>the kitchen to get what Ranma asked for.<p>"Now then," Ranma continued, "Like I said, I am Saotome Ranma,<br/>and Saotome Genma is my pop. Which means I'm engaged to one<br/>of you..."<p>"What do you mean engaged? You're a girl!" Surprisingly, this<br/>outburst came from Nabiki and not Akane.<p>"I'll explain that in a second, but first, neither of you want to be<br/>engaged to me at the moment right?"<p>Both Nabiki and Akane shook there heads.<p>"Tendo-sama, are these all your children?"<p>"No," Soun said resolutely, "my eldest daughter is in the kitchen."<p>"Oh! She's your daughter too? I'm sorry! It's just she doesn't look<br/>anything like you. Except maybe in the eyes..." Ranma stared at<br/>Soun for a while, "But anyway, Tendo-sama. Do you agree that<br/>maybe the engagement should be called off? These two don't seem<br/>to like the idea and I'm guessing Kasumi will feel the same way."<p>Soun almost nodded, but then stopped himself, "No. I refuse to call<br/>it off. It was an agreement I made under my honor as a martial<br/>artist, to the only true friend I've ever known other than my...my...<br/>wife." Soun started to get misty but he swallowed and continued,<br/>"The engagement will just have to be postponed until a Saotome<br/>and a Tendo can be suitably matched."<p>"Oh okay. So do you mind telling me what you mean by 'suitable'<br/>exactly? I mean YOU wouldn't want to marry me right?"<p>Soun's eyes bulged as he realized he had fallen into a trap. He<br/>COULD satisfy the agreement by marrying the girl, but that wasn't<br/>what he wanted at all. He could say there was too much of an age<br/>difference but in Japan that really wasn't that big a deal. He might<br/>as well drag his word as a martial artist through the mud. But if he<br/>married her...<p>Nabiki smirked. Maybe the girl wasn't so bad after all...assuming<br/>she wasn't serious. She shuddered.<p>"GROWF!" the panda exclaimed stepping between Ranma and<br/>Soun. "Growf growf growf GROWF!"<p>"Aw, Pop doesn't seem to like that idea, Tendo-sama." Ranma said<br/>leaning seductively up against Soun, "too bad, I think you're kind<br/>of..."<p>"GROWF!" Genma said, though the sound was somewhat more<br/>akin to a lion being throttled by a giant squid while sacrificial<br/>lambs are shoved down its throat.<p>Ranma turned around and laughed pointing at her father "I<br/>REALLY got you that time, pops! I'm not at all interested. I'm just<br/>saying he's handsome. And judging by how pretty his daughters<br/>are, his wife must have been really beautiful."<p>Soun wasn't sure how to take this. On one hand the compliments<br/>were going to his head, on the other, there were implications<br/>behind them that were contradictory and not altogether pleasant.<br/>Fainting was looking more and more like a good idea...<p>Kasumi came just in time with four glasses of alternately steaming<br/>and cold water. "Here you go Ranma-chan! I got some more in<br/>case you needed it."<p>"Thanks, Kasumi-chan, that's great." Ranma took one of the<br/>steaming cups and upended it over her...his head.<p>Soun fainted.<p>"Oh, say by the way, would you like to be engaged to me?" Ranma<br/>asked Kasumi.<p>"Wh...wha?" the sasquatch was dumbfounded.<p>"Well you're a Tendo right? I think you're pretty...how about we<br/>get engaged? I wouldn't mind and it would satisfy Family Honor."<p>"S..sure Ranma."<p>"Really?" Ranma asked clasping two of Kasumi's furry hands in<br/>his own, "That's awesome! Now everyone's happy!"<p>"Oh my!" exclaimed Kasumi. She would have blushed... except<br/>she was already pink.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>"Why don't you fight me?" Akane demanded angrily of the<br/>pigtailed boy in front of her. Ranma had, since engaging himself to<br/>Kasumi, changed into a girl, back into a guy again and then into a<br/>martial arts gi, explaining that he felt like a workout and asking if<br/>he could use their dojo. Akane's father was still unconscious and<br/>she was still in her gi so she had decided to ask the sex-changing<br/>pervert to spar with her. Beating the little man bitch up would<br/>relieve some stress. But the bastard wasn't taking any of her hits!<br/>He wasn't even blocking!<p>"What do you mean, Akane? I AM fighting you!" Ranma ducked<br/>under one of Akane's errant blows.<p>"No you're NOT! You're just dodging around!"<p>"Well duh!" Ranma replied crossing his eyes, "if I don't dodge I'll<br/>get hit!"<p>"You could attack you know. I can take it."<p>"Um... okay... I'm going to kick you in the stomach then, how's<br/>that?"<p>"What?"<p>Ranma kicked Akane in the stomach. Akane fell to the ground<br/>sucking in breath and writhing in pain.<p>"Why didn't you dodge that?" Ranma asked, genuinely perplexed.<p>"I... wasn't expecting... you to call...your move out!" Akane<br/>protested.<p>"That's a Saotome tradition! It's only fair you give your opponent<br/>time to prepare. Not calling out your attack when you start a fight<br/>upsets Family Honor." Ranma said matter-of-factly, crossing his<br/>arms.<p>"But what if you're fighting for real?" Akane asked.<p>"I don't know what you mean. I would never fight someone who<br/>wasn't prepared to fight."<p>"But what if he WAS?"<p>"Then I would scarcely need to call out my attacks, then would I?"<br/>Ranma replied, "And there's no reason to say 'he'. it could just as<br/>easily be a girl, you know."<p>"How do you figure?"<p>"Well, recently, most of the people I've fought have been girls..."<p>"I KNEW it! You're a sadistic perverted FREAK!" Just like every<br/>other boy, Akane added mentally<p>Ranma blinked. Then he snapped his fingers. "Hey! You know<br/>what? I think you got the wrong idea somehow! Let me see if I can<br/>explain. It's really a funny story..."<p>Akane crossed her arms and gave Ranma her best Nabiki brand I-<br/>don't-believe-a-word-you're-saying look.<p>"Okay so after all that business with Jusenkyo and me trying to<br/>calm Pops down—you'd think he thought I was dead or<br/>something!—and finding out about the curse not being<br/>permanent... Anyway after all that, Pops and I were REALLY<br/>starving. And the guide we were with, he mentions this place<br/>nearby named Nyuuchezutswun. Well it turns out<br/>Nyuuchezutswun means Amazon village, and the Amazons there<br/>were holding this tournament and first prize was—get this—an<br/>entire banquet table full of every type of food you can think of! So<br/>I ask the guide if I can..."<p>"Let me guess" Akane interrupted, "You challenged the winner of<br/>the tournament for the prize, you won and the entire village was so<br/>impressed with your prowess that they invited you to join them and<br/>learn from them."<p>"Um, well...INITIALLY Shampoo—she's the one I challenged-<br/>vowed to hunt me to the ends of the Earth and kill me, but after we<br/>worked that out, yes that's more or less what happened," Ranma<br/>admitted.<p>"Honestly, you could at least offer a better excuse than some<br/>overused male fantasy of big-breasted Amazonion bimbos falling<br/>over themselves to teach you their savage ways."<p>"How'd you know they had big breasts?" Ranma asked.<p>"Look, you ignorant prick, I happen to know something about this.<br/>The most likely candidates for Amazons were the Berbers of Libya<br/>and they were all conquered in 700AD during the first Arab<br/>invasion. There aren't any Amazons in China, and if there were<br/>they wouldn't have big breasts because they burn them off. They<br/>get in the way of archery."<p>"Well yeah that's what they did before they migrated to China and<br/>started experimenting with the magic from the Jusenkyo springs.<br/>Everyone over there's worried they may have to move again if the<br/>Chinese government doesn't loosen up." Ranma looked thoughtful<br/>for a moment, "You'd probably like it over there. They really are<br/>big on history. Cheongsam are the fashion now, but about once a<br/>year they do this weird ceremony where the elders wear these<br/>pointy hats and speak Greek. They call it the 'Fall of Kahina' or<br/>some such thing. It's almost creepy really."<p>Akane's jaw went slack. Kahina was a historic Berber woman who<br/>resisted the Arab invasion...and evidence showed that Amazons<br/>DID wear pointed hats on occasion...How did Ranma know these<br/>things unless... No. It had to be some kind of trick. Ranma<br/>probably read up on Amazons and then concocted an entire<br/>storyline so he could brag about it later. "Look, I don't know what<br/>scrolls or whatnot you've been reading but your story just doesn't<br/>make sense. Why would a girl swear to kill you and then accept<br/>you into her tribe?"<p>"Well I was female when I defeated her. By Amazon law, as soon<br/>as I defeated her she was responsible for my death. The thing is an<br/>outsider woman who defeats an Amazon is automatically part of<br/>the tribe. Its kind of funny but being responsible for my death,<br/>meant Shampoo had to make sure that I did not die except by her<br/>own hand. If I had run away she would have tried to kill me, so she<br/>could end the geas quickly, but since I stayed in the tribe and its<br/>unlawful to use lethal maneuvers against a fellow Amazon in the<br/>village without issuing a challenge, she actually ended up<br/>protecting me part of the time."<p>Ranma gave a short chuckle, "Of course I didn't know that at the<br/>time. The guide we were with wanted to hightail it out of there and<br/>I almost went too, but I figured if we ran away we'd just have to<br/>deal with the problem later anyway, and I was thinking maybe the<br/>Amazons had their own kind of Family Honor. And I can certainly<br/>understand acting a little strange if it's for Family Honor."<p>"So what did you do?" asked Akane feigning interest as a plan<br/>formed in her brain.<p>"I performed the Giri Mouko Taosu."<p>"Family Honor Strikes Down Fierce Tiger?"<p>"Well Pops originally called it the Mouko Rakuchi-sei, but that<br/>wasn't really accurate and since Pops and I both developed it into<br/>an art in its own right, we decided to change the name."<p>Akane nodded seriously and then aimed a front snap kick toward<br/>Ranma's chin. It would have been thoroughly satisfying to see the<br/>tip of the arrogant asshole's tongue arcing out his mouth and<br/>trailing bright red blood as it flew on its trajectory to the floor...but<br/>unfortunately Ranma leaned back almost to the floor at the last<br/>moment and flipped away from Akane. "Fight me, you jerk!"<br/>Akane screamed in exasperation.<p>Once Ranma was back on his feet he continued speaking as if he<br/>were merely changing the subject. "You know, you probably ought<br/>to learn the Giri Mouko Taosu. I think you could find it really<br/>useful. Would you like me to show you the basic form?"<p>Akane cocked her head at Ranma. How long had she wanted her<br/>father to teach her something new? How long had he refused,<br/>saying he couldn't bear to subject his daughter to the training he<br/>had endured? And now finally, here was someone willing to teach<br/>her a new technique! Of course he was a boy, and so he probably<br/>expected Akane to go on a date with him afterwards but if she<br/>could grow as a martial artist then maybe she could stand it just<br/>this once, even if he was a womanizing, sex changing, perverted<br/>freak of nature. "Um... okay sure." Akane smiled.<p>"You know, you're kind of cute when you smile..." Ranma<br/>smirked.<p>Akane stopped smiling immediately. She didn't want this asshole<br/>to think she liked him. Gods, the last thing she needed was another<br/>Kuno.<p>Ranma frowned. "Look, it was just a compliment okay? I'm not<br/>trying to get in bed with you or anything. I just think it's a shame<br/>you scowl so much when you have a cute smile like that."<p>"I would NEVER get in bed with someone as perverted as you!"<br/>Akane declared. That this "wild stallion" would even think of such<br/>things proved he was more perverted than any of the boys at<br/>school. Maybe even more than Kuno.<p>Ranma shrugged Akane's comment off. "The first basic kata of the<br/>Giri Mouko Taosu is fairly simple to learn, but difficult to<br/>master..."<p>Akane calmed herself into her student mode. She was a good<br/>student. She got all A's in school and she could answer any<br/>teacher's question. She valued knowledge with just as much vigor<br/>as her sister Nabiki...although it wasn't the same KIND of<br/>knowledge. Yes this boy-girl man-freak that barged into her home<br/>and started bossing people around deserved to be beaten<br/>thoroughly, but on the off chance that he...she...IT had anything to<br/>teach her...she would bear it a few moments longer.<p>"First," Ranma continued, seeing that he had Akane's attention, "<br/>You stand in the Yoi position, feet shoulder-width apart..."<p>"I KNOW what the Yoi position is, Ranma!" Akane snapped as<br/>her calm evaporated.<p>"Um... well okay but you're doing it all wrong."<p>"What do you mean?" To say that Akane didn't know the Yoi, or<br/>ready position was like accusing someone of not breathing<br/>correctly. She had learned it when she was a baby for crying out<br/>loud! Akane was so surprised at Ranma's gall she didn't have<br/>enough time to be properly pissed.<p>"Well, you're too tense for one thing. There's no way you'd be<br/>ready for an attack with how stiff you are. And one thing you<br/>should NEVER do is lock your knees up like that. I could break<br/>both of them in two seconds if I wanted to, besides you don't have<br/>much balance that way."<p>Akane realized Ranma was right. She forced herself to relax into<br/>the proper position, the position she had known since childhood<br/>and could reach even if blinded.<p>"Yeah, that's much better... except your feet are a little too far<br/>apart and your fists aren't tight enough..."<p>Akane growled but made the necessary adjustments.<p>"Oh and you're not breathing correctly. Your breaths are too short<br/>and shallow, like you're angry at me or something. You need to<br/>take nice deep, even breaths..."<p>Akane grimaced and forced herself to calm down again. She could<br/>stand this humility a little longer if it meant learning something...<br/>but she sincerely hoped it was worth it. Sixteen was too young an<br/>age to be convicted of homicide. She was in perfect form now.<br/>Saotome had distracted her before, but now she was flawless...<p>"Okay," Ranma said, hesitantly, "I guess that's good enough for<br/>now...but really you need to..." Ranma read Akane's expression.<br/>"Uh never mind... The next move is a little tricky. Bend your knees<br/>as far as possible and raise on the balls of your feet so you're kind<br/>of sitting on your heels."<p>Akane did as Ranma directed. "What is this supposed to..."<p>"From this position you can jump full force into the air at a<br/>moments notice, letting you attack or dodge someone else's<br/>attack."<p>Akane fell on her ass.<p>"Also, it helps with balance," Ranma said with a smirk.<p>Akane got back up onto the balls of her feet. She was just a little<br/>surprised... that was all. She had plenty of balance. She beat up all<br/>those boys at school didn't she? She beat Kuno all the time didn't<br/>she? She had balance up the wazoo.<p>Akane fell on her ass again.<p>"Don't worry bout it," Ranma said. "When I first learned that<br/>position I fell too. It isn't quite like most balancing where it's side<br/>to side. It's forward or back." Ranma looked away smiling. "Of<br/>course, I was six at the time..."<p>Akane decided that she absolutely and unequivocally hated<br/>Saotome Ranma. The boy bitch must be some insidious beast from<br/>one of the more unpleasant hells. This treatment just wasn't fair.<br/>She could do that position no problem, but Ranma made her so<br/>angry...<p>"Let's go on to the next position. That one's easy. Just bring your<br/>knees to the ground and sit like your having tea or something. Just<br/>make sure you're still supported by the balls of your feet."<p>Akane did as her ad hoc sensei asked. "How's this supposed be<br/>any good in a fight?"<p>"Well you're right, you can't attack too easily from this position,<br/>but here it's not so much mobility as defense and distraction. You<br/>wouldn't expect an opponent to sit down in front of you in the<br/>middle of a fight would you? Besides, you got full use of your<br/>hands and you can always raise your knees into position two or go<br/>on to the next position and push off into a flip."<p>Akane took a tortured breath. "Okay what's the next position?"<p>"That's the most important position. What I'm about to tell you is<br/>the most important move I ever learned and it's saved my hide<br/>plenty of times."<p>"What is it already!"<p>"Okay, raise your arms straight up in the air."<p>Akane did so feeling a little stupid "Okay."<p>"Now lower your hands and upper torso to the ground and say<br/>you're sorry."<p>Akane's head jerked up. "NANI?"<p>"Go on, say you're sorry. Better yet you could say something like<br/>'Saotome Ranma, please forgive me for calling you a perverted<br/>freak and for trying to hurt you during what was supposed to be a<br/>friendly spar.'"<p>"The hell I will!" Akane got back onto her feet.<p>"Well it's up to you really," Ranma shrugged, "But the more<br/>specific to the situation the better. Gives your opponent the idea<br/>that you truly understand what it was you did wrong and that you<br/>aren't going do it any more."<p>"I didn't do anything wrong!"<p>Ranma looked confused. "I'm sorry, Akane, I haven't made myself<br/>clear. What you did WAS wrong. Now normally it wouldn't<br/>matter. I don't take insults from ignorant people very seriously<br/>anymore, but I..."<p>"I'm not ignorant!" Akane raised a fist at Ranma.<p>"Um...okay. I guess maybe you're in a bad mood or something and<br/>it's making you stupid. But that really doesn't matter. Anyway like<br/>I was saying...I intend to marry your sister. That makes us family.<br/>If you keep insulting me and attacking me out of anger its going to<br/>upset Family Honor and I don't think either one of us wants that."<p>"Fuck family honor!" Akane said and a unleashed a haymaker in<br/>Ranma's general direction that the boy easily avoided. Akane was<br/>caught however by the curiously sad and frightened expression on<br/>Ranma's face.<p>"You *really* shouldn't have said that," he said.<p>Then Akane heard an awful growling sound behind her...<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>"So, Kasumi, that strange man sitting with Daddy in the living<br/>room...that's Mr. Saotome?" Nabiki asked her older sister, holding<br/>the curtain above the entrance to the kitchen over her head with her<br/>hand.<p>"Yes...would you let Akane know she can take her bath now?"<br/>Kasumi was efficiently making dinner with all eight of her arms.<p>Nabiki was always amazed at how she could keep track of<br/>everything her arms were doing. So often in Nabiki's business the<br/>left arm didn't know what the right was doing much less whatever<br/>any other limbs might be up to. Nabiki grimaced as she realized<br/>she had thought of an extremely bad pun. Returning from her short<br/>reverie she said, "Oh Akane's fighting Ranma right now. You<br/>know how she is."<p>"Yes, I do wish she'd stop being so violent."<p>"Kasumi...why did you say yes?" Nabiki asked.<p>Kasumi's simian features curved in a wistful smile, and she paused<br/>over her cooking. "I don't know really. I just saw something in<br/>him... somehow I feel he's a kindred spirit. I feel like I could talk<br/>to him about anything, and he would understand." Kasumi started<br/>cooking again but at a slower, pensive pace.<p>"But...don't you think you should get to know him first? He<br/>seemed pretty sharp and all and he IS pretty cute, but you never<br/>know about people..."<p>"Nabiki...I can't explain it but I know he's right for me. I've never<br/>been so sure before in my life."<p>"But..." Nabiki tried to think of how best to word what she was<br/>about to say. "Well, sis, I really hate to point this out...and you<br/>know it doesn't make you any less of a person but...well...you<br/>ARE a pink, polka-dotted, eight-armed, pygmy sasquatch...don't<br/>you think that might cause problems?"<p>"Oh, Nabiki, you're just jealous you didn't say yes when you had<br/>the chance." Kasumi smiled and continued cooking.<p>"Yeah..." Nabiki muttered, "That was it...I'm sorry for bothering<br/>you." And with that, the middle Tendo daughter left the kitchen,<br/>and walked to the stairs.<p>Nabiki could never figure out her older sister. At the same moment<br/>she seemed completely oblivious to what was going on... she<br/>could also have such sharp insight it was frightening.<p>Nabiki WAS a little jealous. Even she hadn't realized it though. It<br/>would be so much fun having a boyfriend like Ranma, who could<br/>also be a girl, who actually had some intelligence, who was cute...<br/>If he only had money he'd be perfect. But even there...did she<br/>really want to marry into money? No, not really. She had to be the<br/>bread winner. She wouldn't be able to stand it any other way.<br/>Ranma was a great catch and she had let him slip by.<p>What Nabiki was having the toughest time with, though, was the<br/>feeling she had that Ranma would be wasted on Kasumi. As much<br/>as she loved her sister, and she did love her, there was still some<br/>part of her that screamed she was not human. Nabiki had no idea<br/>before tonight that this part of her existed. It sickened her.<p>She plodded upstairs to her room. She opened her closet. And<br/>crouched down to a wicker chest. She opened it with a painful<br/>creak. There, gleaming in the light was her salvation. All she had<br/>to do was stick it in her mouth and pull and then all her troubles<br/>would go away.<p>She picked it up, marveling at its feel, at how something so simple<br/>could have such awesome power. She put it into her mouth closing<br/>her eyes imagining what it was going to feel like to have a foreign<br/>object coursing through her body at such an awesome speed. She<br/>took a breath...and pulled.<p>The bag of potato chips now open, Nabiki stuck her hand inside<br/>and greedily inhaled some twenty chips before finally calming<br/>down.<p>With such golden crispy goodness in the world, even having<br/>jealous thoughts of a primate's fiancé isn't all that bad.<p>Between chips, Nabiki heard several thuds and the sounds of<br/>screaming coming from the dojo.<p>Well, she thought, popping another chip in her mouth, might as<br/>well see what that's about.<p>She was at the door about to head downstairs when she stopped,<br/>popped another chip, and got her camera.<p>There really is nothing quite like potato chips and espionage to<br/>soothe the nerves.<p>Tendo Soun looked at his friend Saotome Genma, tears streaming<br/>down his face.<p>Saotome Genma looked at his friend Tendo Soun, tears streaming<br/>down his face.<p>"The life of a true martial artist is fraught with peril." Soun sobbed<br/>looking off into the darkness.<p>"You don't know the half of it, Tendo." Genma declared.<p>"There's more?" Soun asked, incredulous.<p>"Yes, the worst is still to come."<p>"What could be worse than to have a son who's a girl half the time,<br/>who's a better martial artist than you are but acts like an annoying<br/>brat?"<p>"I know, it seems impossible, but it's true. There is something<br/>much, much worse."<p>"What is it, Saotome?"<p>"Family Honor," Genma said and then broke into a fresh onslaught<br/>of sobs himself.<p>"I don't understand...You mean that crazy deal you made with<br/>your wife that you'd kill yourself if you didn't make Ranma a man<br/>among men?"<p>"No... it's worse than that..."<p>"You mean the contract you signed with your Uncle Jiro that you'd<br/>give Ranma over to him on his eighteenth birthday so he could<br/>perform genetic experiments on a human host?"<p>"No...it's worse."<p>"You can't mean that time you sent a lock of Ranma's hair to your<br/>cousin in Australia so he could practice mind control using a<br/>digeridoo?"<p>"No," Genma laughed, "that was a joke."<p>"Well then, Saotome, what is it?"<p>Genma remained silent.<p>"Come now, it can't be that bad..."<p>Genma gave Soun a nice long baleful look. "Have you ever heard<br/>of a technique called the Nekoken?"<p>"No, can't say that I have."<p>"It can only be taught to adolescents on the first onset of puberty."<p>"Why's that?"<p>"There's a greater amount of psychic energy then due to all the<br/>hormones. I imagine if you gave enough supplemental drugs to<br/>someone they could learn the technique too but that's kind of<br/>dangerous. You remember what happened to the master..."<p>Soun shuddered. "Yes. He was such a nice old man before..."<p>"Anyway you take the student, you cover him in fish paste or some<br/>other fish material and you blind fold him, tie him up so he can't<br/>move and throw him into a pit of starving house cats."<p>"Then what?"<p>"That's it. That's how the student learns the technique. You keep<br/>doing it again and again until they learn the Nekoken."<p>"I don't understand. Even given the psychic energy part I don't see<br/>how house cats could be used in any kind of training."<p>"Well the idea is to cause the subject to develop a phobia to them."<p>"How could anyone be afraid of a cat? Tigers I could understand.<br/>I'm a little afraid of tigers myself. Or lions...but plain old felix<br/>domesticus?"<p>"Actually there are quite a few people who have a phobia to cats.<br/>It's called ailurophobia..."<p>"Well a little superstition I can understand. I mean I get a little<br/>anxious when I see a black cat and I could see how that could<br/>generalize into all cats, but I do not see how taking a bath in cats<br/>could induce a phobia."<p>"You aren't listening. The cats are hungry. They've been starved<br/>for days. You cover the subject in fish paste THEN throw him in<br/>the pit."<p>"Saotome, have you ever seen a house cat eat?"<p>"Yes."<p>"Would you describe the act as being particularly voracious?"<p>"Well no..."<p>"I don't care how much you starve a cat, Saotome they're still<br/>going to be as dainty as hypersensitive French women with<br/>electrodes up their asses."<p>"But they scratch a lot..."<p>"Oh yes they DO scratch. And the scratches are so severe<br/>sometimes it takes a whole DAY for them to heal! Good grief,<br/>Saotome what are you smoking? There's only two dangers you<br/>have from house cats assuming they ARE house cats and they<br/>don't have rabies or anything of the sort. They can scratch out<br/>someone's eye, or they can smother them in their sleep. As long as<br/>you keep a blindfold on the subject and check on him from time to<br/>time he should be fine. In fact, I'll bet you on that. I know a kid,<br/>bout eleven or twelve, comes around every now and then wanting<br/>to learn martial arts. He won't leave me alone... I bet if we used<br/>this training method absolutely nothing would happen."<p>Genma gave his best "Is that your final answer" look and<br/>continued "Well...anyway as I was saying I put Ranma through the<br/>Nekoken training..."<p>"What? You put your own son through that torture?"<p>"Yes, I was telling you about Family Honor."<p>"I thought you changed the subject... Saotome, that's pretty cold<br/>putting your son through that. I could never do that to my<br/>daughters."<p>"But you just said that it was harmless!"<p>"For a student sure, but the idea that you would subject your own<br/>flesh and blood willingly to the claws of hungry beasts... I don't<br/>know..."<p>Genma sighed... "Ranma is my son but he is also the heir to the<br/>school of Anything Goes. I felt I had to train him hard to make him<br/>strong."<p>"Well your son is a boy...I guess it's okay. I'd never train my<br/>babies that hard though. I taught each of them just enough for self<br/>defense and that's it. That's all they need to know."<p>If Genma had just found out Soun was an extraterrestrial being<br/>with a meter long proboscis that could suck souls out people's<br/>bodies and was in the habit of implanting them in poultry, Genma<br/>would not have been more surprised. The entire point of the<br/>marriage was to unite the two schools. If Soun hadn't taught his<br/>branch of the school to his daughters then the Tendo family claim<br/>was worthless. There were so many other engagements that Genma<br/>could have let happen...that Kuonji girl, the Noodle cook's<br/>daughter, and especially the Amazon...all of them were to be<br/>trained or already were trained in some form of the Art, but Genma<br/>backed Ranma out of each of them thinking surely Tendo had<br/>trained his daughters in Anything Goes, that they would be the best<br/>match, and that one of them would marry Ranma and teach the Art<br/>to their children and the Art would continue forever.<p>Soun screwed that plan right up.<p>Ranma's infatuation with the monkey had to be a joke. Genma had<br/>intended to get his son to choose Akane somehow, but now to<br/>know she wasn't a master of the Art? The entire engagement had<br/>to be called off. Still he was Soun's friend. How could he stop the<br/>engagement without going against his friend's wishes or more<br/>importantly, Family Honor?<p>Postcards.<p>Yes, all he had to do was send postcards to all the other fiancées,<br/>letting them know where Ranma was. They would end up fighting<br/>each other and the strongest... Yes this would work! It was perfect!<br/>In fact, it would have been a good idea even if Soun HAD trained<br/>his girls. And to sweeten it, he could continually force Ranma and<br/>the Tendo girls together, which would of course only drive them<br/>further apart, but Soun wouldn't know that. The only problem was<br/>Ranma himself. And of course Family Honor. Genma had a feeling<br/>they wouldn't cooperate.<p>"So," Soun spoke interrupting Genma's thoughts, "You were<br/>saying something about family honor?"<p>"Yes. You see...you must understand that I told many stories of<br/>samurai to the boy. Ranma loved them, but he was always<br/>particularly interested in the stories about family honor. A<br/>concubine would have to kill herself to appease family honor, a<br/>samurai would banish himself from the empire so that family<br/>honor could be satisfied, and there were other stories I told him.<br/>About how one family would rule over the others because they had<br/>family honor while the others did not. What I did not realize as I<br/>told these stories is that Ranma did not quite understand what I was<br/>talking about."<p>"How do you mean?"<p>"Ranma somehow came to the conclusion that Family Honor was<br/>the name of a very large, vicious, and invisible dog."<p>"Kids are funny like that."<p>"Heh heh...yeah...funny."<p>Just then, Soun and Genma heard a loud sharp scream come from<br/>the dojo followed by a series of alarmingly loud thuds.<p>"What was that!" Soun exclaimed.<p>"That would be Family Honor getting acquainted with your<br/>daughter Akane." Genma said.<p>Soun started to get up but Genma grabbed Soun's arm tightly.<p>"Don't," Genma cautioned, "You'll only make things worse."<p>"But my baby!"<p>"Akane will be fine as long as she performs the Giri Mouko<br/>Taosu."<p>"What's that?"<p>"I'm sorry."<p>"What?"<p>"As long as she says she's sorry, she'll be fine."<p>Soun shot to his feet, his face ashen. "She'll be killed..."<p>"No, she'll be okay. Don't worry."<p>"I hardly think a large vicious dog is going to be careful with my<br/>baby."<p>"No she'll be fine. The most she'll get is a few scars."<p>Soun looked incredulous.<p>"You see what was supposed to happen was that the cats would<br/>awaken Ranma's Id and it would gather ki around itself until it<br/>could manifest as something semi-corporeal, an extension of<br/>Ranma's body that could still react with the environment." Genma<br/>explained. "The problem is that instead of regressing to a primal<br/>state, Ranma called upon what he saw as a righteous if ruthless<br/>savior. Instead of the power coalescing around Ranma's Id, it<br/>coalesced about his Superego which for some reason Ranma drove<br/>out of himself."<p>"So in other words, any time Ranma is witness to something he<br/>deems morally reprehensible Family Honor punishes the wrong<br/>doer?"<p>"Yes."<p>"Hmm... Akane has a very similar condition, except it involves a<br/>large wooden mallet."<p>"How do you suppose that happened?"<p>"I'm afraid Akane never quite understood the culinary arts. She got<br/>the completely wrong idea about what it meant to 'tenderize'. Then<br/>in Junior high she started having trouble with boys..."<p>"Tendo, did we ever have any paranormal projections of our moral<br/>selves when we were teenagers?"<p>"Not that I recall, Saotome."<p>Genma shook his head and sighed as Akane's screams rose in<br/>pitch. "Kids these days..."<p>"Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm." Soun nodded sagely.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Meanwhile, back in the dojo...<p>"<br/>!" Akane seemed to say<br/>as she was spun around the dojo rapidly by a giant invisible canine.<p>Nabiki watched, amused, as she munched on some potato chips<br/>and snapped a few photos.<p>Ranma cupped his hands and yelled to Akane. "Just say you're<br/>sorry! That's all you have to do!"<p>"!"<p>Just as Akane finished her fifteenth revolution, Kasumi entered the<br/>dojo and called out, "Akane! Ranma! Dinner is almost ready! You<br/>can take your baths now!"<p>Almost instantly, Akane was released allowing her to fly toward<br/>the wall at great speed. The wall desperately tried to stop Akane<br/>but she was a stubborn girl and broke right through, landing in the<br/>koi pond. This would have been impossible, as the pond was on the<br/>other side of the house, except for the intervention of a tree which<br/>caught Akane, bent backwards, and released her as if it were the<br/>second baseman in a peculiar game of baseball. Why the tree did<br/>this is the subject of much debate among the sentient squirrels of<br/>the area, but since no one pays much attention to them, their<br/>opinion hardly matters in the overall scheme of things.<p>"Oh my!" Kasumi exclaimed, "I hope Akane is all right."<p>"I'm sure she is, Kasumi. Still...Hey Nabs you think you could<br/>check on Akane?" Ranma asked Nabiki.<p>"Nabs..." Nabiki muttered. Then she shrugged, popped a chip in<br/>her mouth, and left to witness the aftermath.<p>"Akane will probably be fine, Kasumi." Ranma assured his<br/>fiancée. Family Honor used to kill all sorts of people, but it's less<br/>violent now." Ranma eyed the Akane-shaped hole in the wall "I<br/>tried to warn her, but she wouldn't listen."<p>"Yes, I'm afraid Akane-chan never cared for Family Honor..."<br/>Kasumi sighed, "She's a little stubborn but otherwise she's a good<br/>girl."<p>"Yeah, I saw that a little bit. How'd she get that way?"<p>"She had a few bad experiences in Junior High, and there is this<br/>older boy named Kuno...but I think really it started when Mother<br/>died. I think Akane took it harder than any of us."<p>"That's rough. I didn't really get a chance to know my mother. If it<br/>wasn't for Family Honor, I'd probably be just like Akane."<p>Kasumi nodded sadly. "It's strange...you're the first person I've<br/>ever met who cares so much about Family Honor. Most people<br/>think it's dead."<p>"I know. Most people don't worry about it 'till it bites them in the<br/>ass." And with that, the two of them walked out of the dojo,<br/>holding hands.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~~<p>Akane was floating face down in the koi pond. A red cloud of<br/>blood curled away from her, irritating the fish.<p>Nabiki popped another potato chip in her mouth.<p>Apparently Akane was dead.<p>Nabiki snapped a photo. Maybe she could get some money from<br/>the newspapers.<p>Nabiki sighed. "Oh well." She poured the last crumbs of potato<br/>chips in her mouth and then shoved the empty bag into her shorts<br/>pocket so she could throw it in the trash later. Then she got into the<br/>water and with an almost clinical efficiency she dragged Akane<br/>out.<p>She felt the side of Akane's neck, put a hand a couple of<br/>centimeters away from her mouth, then pinched the nose and<br/>wiggled a little. She sighed. "I'm never going to live this down you<br/>know..." and with that Nabiki kissed Akane.<p>Almost immediately after Nabiki's brief bout with lesbian<br/>incestual necrophilia, Akane started spurting out water. Nabiki<br/>turned her little sister's head to the side and waited.<p>Akane slowly turned her head up. "N-N-Nabiki? You...saved my<br/>life!" she exclaimed, breaking through Nabiki's line of thought.<p>There weren't any potato chips left. All of a sudden Nabiki<br/>desperately needed them as her emotions threatened to well up.<br/>Quickly she thought of her options...She could either A. Hug her<br/>sister and tell her how she was so worried and didn't want that to<br/>happen again so please stop doing this stupid martial arts crap. B.<br/>Cry incoherently or C...<p>Nabiki smirked and held her hand out. "That will be 5,000 yen."<p>Whew. That was close.<p>"No, I'm telling you, Nabs, Akane was in no real danger. Family<br/>Honor would not have allowed her to drown. If you hadn't been<br/>there, she would've gotten out of that pond on her own." Ranma<br/>assured resolutely.<p>"No real danger? Saotome she's a completely different person!"<p>"Um...she is?" Ranma looked confused.<p>After Nabiki brought her inside she had done some tests. "How<br/>many fingers?" Nabiki had asked.<p>"Three fingers!" Akane had replied.<p>"And who is this?" Nabiki had asked pointing at Kasumi.<p>"Big sister Kasumi!"<p>"And this?"<p>"Daddy!"<p>"And this?"<p>"My dear Uncle Saotome!"<p>Nabiki knew something was wrong, but it was unconfirmed until<br/>Akane had followed Kasumi happily into the kitchen. As if she<br/>weren't Akane, destroyer of kitchens, but instead some Martha<br/>Stewart wannabe with a crack addiction.<p>"Now, Akane, I'm perfectly capable of cooking dinner by myself,"<br/>Kasumi had said.<p>But the clincher was when Akane said "Yes, but I really want to<br/>learn to cook! How will I ever please my husband if I can't cook a<br/>meal?" Kasumi managed to keep her from actually touching the<br/>food...but, supper had been super surreal.<p>Ranma and his father explained about Jusenkyo and Family Honor<br/>while Akane acted like some kind of Kasumi clone...only with not<br/>as much fur or as many arms. Even a stranger had to know<br/>something was up.<p>Back in the present Nabiki gave Ranma a sub-zero stare.<p>"Well, alright" Ranma said, "I guess I did notice she was acting a<br/>little different, but it seemed to be a good thing as far as I could<br/>see."<p>"Saotome, I don't know what game you're playing. I don't really<br/>care. But...Akane has to be able to fight tomorrow. The boys<br/>challenge her everyday at school. I'm giving you responsibility for<br/>her safety. Either cure her or protect her, but it's your mess to<br/>clean up. And you better be serious about marrying Kasumi. If you<br/>break her heart, Saotome I swear I'll...If you hurt either one of my<br/>sisters again you are going to pay. Big time."<p>As if on cue, Akane started screaming as she ran out of her room.<p>Nabiki caught her sister as she passed. "What is it Akane?"<p>"Its terrible! Terrible! It smells so bad!"<p>Nabiki walked briskly to Akane's room, followed by Ranma and<br/>an overly frightened Akane. She opened the door...and<br/>immediately closed it. The smell was ungodly. Even the small<br/>amount she had allowed through was making her want to gag.<br/>"What is in there Akane?"<p>"It's probably dog crap." Ranma offered matter-of-factly.<p>"We don't own a dog Saotome. And there's no way a dog could<br/>make a smell that bad."<p>Ranma shrugged, smiling mischievously. "Yeah, well...Family<br/>Honor's a bitch. What can I say?"<p>Nabiki grimaced. And she thought HER pun was bad...<p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~<p>AN: Yes, I know that the "real" words to Jajauma ni Sasenaide are<br/>different in places. I know for instance that instead of "ocean<br/>breeze" they say "sea bream" and that's a kind of fish. But it's kind<br/>of hard to say that in a song. Basically I wanted an English version<br/>of the song that I could sing along to, and I felt the viz version was<br/>a little unsatisfactory. (Ranma Ranma, it's me you always tease?<br/>My heart is like Mah Jong to you?) Granted, my version isn't<br/>much better if at all, and the song's kind of silly anyway, but there<br/>you go.<p>Thanks to NemesisZero, Yakumo, Aondehafka, Jeram,<br/>Edward, and Dunefar for their help. Any mistakes are purely my<br/>own.<p>Comments and criticisms? Yes please!
