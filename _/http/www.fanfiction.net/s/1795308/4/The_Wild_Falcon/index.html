</div><p>Disclaimer:</p><p><b>Dark Master Schmidt:</b> I don't own Ranma; if I did, I wouldn't be writing fanfiction. The only thing I own is the story, which is not entirely mine, either, anyway...</p><p><b>Nuvares:</b> Yeah, what he said.</p><p>"..." Chinese.</p><p>"(...)" Japanese.</p><p>'...' Thoughts.</p><p style="text-align:center;">The Wild Falcon</p><p style="text-align:center;">By</p><p style="text-align:center;">Dark Master Schmidt</p><p style="text-align:center;">&amp; Nuvares</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 4: Hell vs. Reality</p><p>Ryouga stared at the night sky with an irritated look on his face. The day's events were finally over; that meant that he could relax for change, even though it was only going to last until tomorrow.</p><p>Lying on the grass, he watched the sky without much interest. A pair of ear buds hung from his ears, and Nakashima Mika's singing voice pierced through his skull. The music helped him calm down, but that wasn't nearly enough.</p><p>Ryouga had a problem. It was a very big problem; an enormously big problem, and he was at the centre of it. No, he'd better scratch that. He had several big problems.</p><p>The first problem was the Jusenkyo curse. That was pretty much the source of his problems. If only he could somehow get rid of it... Now that Ryouga thought about it, he never attempted to do something like that. But even if he wanted to, how would he do that? Maybe he should go back to Jusenkyo and ask that... guide, or whatever he called himself.</p><p>The cursed form seemed to... make people get attracted to him. Apparently, it only worked on women for some annoying reason. Not that he wanted attraction from males, of course. On the other hand, did it really not work with males? Ryouga never really got the chance to 'test it' out on men long enough. There was Ranma, but he tended to act like an idiot, so it was kind of hard to tell... Well, that was his second problem.</p><p>And thirdly, he had Shampoo. Ryouga cringed at that thought. That was technically an extension of the second problem, but it was big enough to warrant a column of its own. Ryouga had somehow gotten himself engaged—or was it married?—to a girl within a few minutes of interaction with her. While it sounded good on paper, that was most definitely <i>not</i> a good thing.</p><p>She was pretty adamant about the whole marriage thing. From yesterday's conversation, it seemed that beating a woman of Joketsuzoku in combat is a declaration of marriage. Moreover, he had no idea how to get rid of her; it was as if she was superglued to him... Annoying, but it was better than death at least, which was the alternative.</p><p>Fourthly and finally, there was the problem of Ranma himself. Ryouga found Ranma, but now what? He wanted to fight him; to settle the score between them, but that bastard was too weak. Ranma's been training again, but he still wasn't the same. Ryouga couldn't fight him in that state, he had to wait, and it was frustrating. The Ranma he longed to beat the crap out of was in front of him, but he couldn't touch him.</p><p>"(Shit.)" Ryouga turned to his side, leaning on his fist. He was in a bad mood, and it could only worsen after seeing Ranma's approaching figure.</p><p>Munching on a chocolate bar, Ranma walked towards the other boy. "(Hey, Ryouga, what's up?)"</p><p>"(What do <i>you</i> want?)" Ryouga frowned.</p><p>"(Jeez, what's with that attitude?)" Ranma took another bite. "(Comff on. Ai'n we badiesh?)"</p><p>"(Don't chew and speak at the same time, you moron,)" Ryouga reproved.</p><p>Ranma swallowed before speaking again. "(I said, 'Come on. Ain't we buddies?')"</p><p>"(Buddies?)" Ryouga looked disgusted. "(Maybe in bizzaro world, Saotome, but not on earth.)"</p><p>"(Come on, man. That's kinda harsh.)" Ranma waved his hand innocently, consuming more chocolate.</p><p>Ryouga sat up, crossing his arms. "(Ditch the stupid act, Saotome. I know you want something. Just spit it out.)"</p><p>"(You can tell?)" Ranma blinked. "(In that case, you got any more of this stuff?)" He pointed at the chocolate bar. "(I really like this. I found it in your tent, by the way. Didn't think you'd care.)"</p><p>Ryouga grumbled something in annoyance under his breath. He grabbed his MD player and got up. "(Screw you, Saotome. I'm going to sleep.)" He headed into his tent, ignoring the confused Ranma.</p><p>"(Hey, what'd I do?)" Ranma scratched the back of his head and took the last bite of the chocolate bar. "(Stupid Ryouga.)" He searched through his pocket and pulled out a box of Pocky. Of course, the chocolate bar wasn't the only thing he took.</p><p>Ranma went back to sit in front of the campfire, all the while stuffing his face with Ryouga's snacks, and started to think.</p><p>Ranma didn't know what to do. He came to China all because of his stupid old man, and now he had no idea where the hell he ran off to. Moreover, a lot seemed to happen as he stayed in China.</p><p>For one thing, he stumbled into his old junior high buddy, Ryouga. Of all places to meet, it had to be China. What a coincidence it was. Ranma wondered why Ryouga was here to begin with. He forgot to ask. At any rate, he decided to stick with Ryouga for now, who didn't seem too happy about it. Now that he thought about it, where the heck was Ryouga heading? They looked to be travelling aimlessly from one spot to another. It was almost as if Ryouga lost the purpose of his life once Ranma found him at Herb's place.</p><p>Ranma almost forgot about Herb for a second. Ranma wasn't sure how Prince Boy would react once he found out that he was human. Maybe he should drop by for a surprise visit later once Ryouga cooled off his head again.</p><p>On the subject of surprises, how would Shampoo react if she found out about Ranma's curse? That was a good question that Ranma probably didn't want the answer to. He had better be careful about that; Shampoo proved that she could be dangerous when she wanted to be. It was a good thing they didn't meet with his father around. Who knew what would have been the result of that?</p><p>"(Stupid old man, dragging me to stupid China...)"</p><p>Ranma chewed harshly on the biscuit sticks. Thinking about his father made him feel irritated. He really wanted to punch him in the face, repeatedly. Wouldn't that feel great...? Where the heck was he anyway?</p><p>"Ranma?" A female voice suddenly called out to him. Speak of the devil.</p><p>"Oh, hey, Shampoo." Ranma took notice of her nervous approach. "What's up?"</p><p>"I was kind of wondering..." Shampoo twirled her index fingers around each other.</p><p>"I'm listening." Ranma gestured for her to sit.</p><p>Shampoo took the empty spot next to him and said, "I was wondering if you knew how I would make my husband like me? Because he seems kind of... I Don't know..."</p><p>'Why the heck are you asking me?' Ranma looked at her wryly.</p><p>"What?" Shampoo looked embarrassed. "Did I say something weird?"</p><p>"No, it's not that..." Ranma thought for a moment. "I have a great idea." He grinned.</p><p>"What is it?" Shampoo piped.</p><p>"Come here for a sec." Ranma gestured for her to come closer. As she did, he whispered something into her ear.</p><p>"Seriously?" Shampoo almost yelled. "I don't know; that seems kind of bold..." She replied calmly this time.</p><p>"Nah." Ranma waved that possibility off. "Ryouga's just a shy guy. I'm sure he's gonna <i>love</i> it!"</p><p>"Hmm, okay," Shampoo agreed. "I'll give it a shot." She quickly ran off towards Ryouga's tent.</p><p>Ranma smiled at Shampoo's retreating figure. He was going to enjoy whatever the outcome of his handiwork generated.</p><p>His smile quickly turned into a frown. Where the hell was he going to sleep now? Ranma thought too fast for his own good... Shampoo had her own tent, but he didn't think she'd like it if he used it. Ranma turned his head, spotting a bucket filled with water.</p><p>Ranma sighed.</p><p>Ryouga cracked open an eye at sunrise. He immediately contemplated ditching his usual morning routine in favour for more sleep in order to avoid the inevitable chaos of the day. On the other hand, there was no avoiding the inevitable, so might as well wake up. He crawled out of his warm blanket, but stopped before getting out of his tent. Something didn't feel right. For one thing, his blanket was warmer than usual. Ryouga was pretty sure a blanket couldn't generate that much heat.</p><p>For another thing, why the heck was he shirtless? Ryouga definitely didn't take off his shirt last night. Before he could look for his shirt, he finally felt that something was under his hand.</p><p>"(What the heck is this?)" He lifted a piece of fabric. It took him a few blinks to realise what it was. Stretching it with his other hand, it became apparent that it was a bra. A rather girlish bra at that.</p><p>Ryouga slowly put it back where he found it. He sank his face into the palm of his hand and took a deep breath. He took another deep breath. "(Okay, Ryouga,)" he started. "(I'm pretty sure there's a perfectly good explanation as to why I'm half naked and why I have lingerie in my tent.)" Ryouga began to think. "(Right? There just <i>has</i> to be one!)"</p><p>Ryouga looked around for his answers. With the correct intent this time, he managed to spot his shirt and a bunch of other clothes that <i>seemed</i> familiar. "(What the heck?)"</p><p>Before he could move to check on the clothes, he found that his blanket began to stir. Wait, blankets didn't move! Within a moment, Shampoo's head popped up for underneath. "Good morning." She yawned.</p><p>Ryouga mentally kicked himself for not noticing her earlier. "Good morning?" He exploded. "What do you think you're doing here?"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Shampoo asked in response as she sat up. "Isn't it natural for a wife to sleep next to her husband?" The cover slid off, revealing her marvellous figure; her topless figure. Actually, it was pretty obvious that she wasn't wearing any pants, either. Shampoo stretched her body to get the sleepiness out of her system. As she did so, the laws of physics proceeded to bounce her perfect jugs like sweet jelly.</p><p>As much as Ryouga wanted to respond to that, he couldn't. Instead, he crawled  against his tent and wailed like a little girl. "What, but- I- Why-"</p><p>His wannabe spouse purred and slowly approached in all fours. "Maybe you're interested in more than sleep?" Shampoo asked sweetly.</p><p>Ryouga finally found his words and managed to retort. "Why- what the hell do you think you're doing in my tent and completely in the nu- ...nu-"</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Shampoo smiled. "I'm still wearing this." She shook her petite butt, having Ryouga notice her only piece of clothing left.</p><p>Somehow, Shampoo's transparent black knickers made Ryouga feel worse. Seriously, why was someone of her age wearing something like <i>that</i>? How did she get her hands on it anyway? But, Ryouga had less time to think and more time to feel.</p><p>Shampoo was finally directly in front of him. She tangled her arms around his neck, give him a good feel of her soft round breasts on his hard muscled chest. With her face close, Ryouga could feel her hot breath on his face.</p><p>"Isn't it about time we took the next step?" She giggled, playing with his hair.</p><p>"Ne- next step? More like the next leap!" Ryouga shifted uncomfortably. "I said no the last time!"</p><p>Shampoo frowned. "You're a man now, aren't you? There are no excuses this time."</p><p>Ryouga looked like he was about to object further, but his voice of reason called out to him.</p><p>"<i>Haha! She's right, Ryouga!"</i> A chibi Ryouga with nasty horns and a tail popped on his left shoulder. <i>"As a man, you must take this chance! No one in his right mind should refuse!"</i> Ryouga's inner evil advised.</p><p>"<i>That's preposterous! Don't listen to him, Ryouga!"</i> Another chibi version of himself appeared on his right shoulder, this one had angelic white wings and a halo, though. <i>"Don't let such rotten thoughts consume you! You must be strong."</i> Ryouga's conscious encouraged.</p><p>"<i>What does he know! He's just a goody two shoes that doesn't know what's best for you."</i></p><p>"<i>Yes, I do! Ryouga, you shouldn't do this! What would your parents think? You must wait until you reach the proper age and get married."</i> Good Ryouga argued.</p><p>"<i>What, marriage?"</i> Evil Ryouga laughed. <i>"In this day and age? That's hilarious material right there! Don't you know that sexual activity is necessary for a good relationship?"</i></p><p>"<i>What? R-Really?"</i> Good Ryouga asked sceptically.</p><p>"<i>Of course!"</i> Evil Ryouga sighed. <i>"Don't you know anything? Sex is important to any healthy relationship, you can't go anywhere without it."</i></p><p>Good Ryouga nodded. <i>"I see."</i> He moved forward and extended his arm. Evil Ryouga did the same and took his hand. They shook in agreement. <i>"We agree on something for once then."</i></p><p>Evil Ryouga grinned and turned to Ryouga. <i>"Now that that's settled. Get on and do it already, Ryouga!"</i></p><p>"<i>Good luck!"</i> Good Ryouga cheered. <i>"And don't forget to wear protection!"</i></p><p>The two finally went poof and out of existence, leaving Ryouga with an annoyed look. Even his conscious had betrayed him! That son of a bitch! What a gullible bastard! Crying in frustration, he tried to move away from Shampoo. She was glued to him with amazing strength, so he only managed send himself along with her to lie on the solid ground.</p><p>"Oh, so you like this position better?" Shampoo sweetly asked on top of him. She never gave him a chance to answer and sealed his lips with a kiss. The fact that he responded was a good sign to her. Shampoo was finally winning him over.</p><p>Ryouga cursed at himself mentally as he returned the kiss. He was starting to get aroused, there was no denying it. He needed to do something before he'd completely submit to Shampoo.</p><p>Shampoo wasn't going to let him do that, though. Breaking the kiss, she took hold of Ryouga's head and shoved it right into her soft mushy breasts, giggling frantically. She slowly began moving her chest, rubbing her tits all over his face. As she did so, Shampoo unconsciously began rubbing her entire body against Ryouga's.</p><p>Ryouga didn't really know what he was feeling at the moment, but his unearthly desires regrettably didn't want it to stop. Shampoo continued to rub her smooth skin against all over his body. She let out a soft moan as she did one long sweep, and he finally felt her crotch across the wet fabric reach his stomach and advance onto his chest. Wait, wet? Ryouga couldn't give that much thought, as Shampoo has already landed on his lips. She then moved back in the opposite direction, giving Ryouga the chance to lick his lips, tasting the sweet juice Shampoo had left all over himself.</p><p>Shampoo finally stopped just below his belly. She raised herself above Ryouga with her arms set on the ground and giggled. The edges of her erect nipples could slightly touch his bare chest, adding to his discomfort.</p><p>Ryouga didn't know if Shampoo's giggles were naturally erotic or she did that intentionally; whatever it was, it made him feel uncomfortable. What she was about to say had nothing on that, though.</p><p>"Would you like to pop my cherry?" she whispered with her mignon lips.</p><p>Ryouga stood like never before.</p><p>Ranma groaned as he stirred on the hard ground. He forcibly shut his eyes and turned around, and then turned back. He finally cried in frustration and sat up. "(Shit. I can't get any sleep.)" He rubbed his eyes and yawned loudly. The aching bones on his back, shoulders, and neck drove him crazy. He really should have taken that sweet and nice bucket on its offer and occupied a tree.</p><p>Ranma stood up and did some stretches. "(Ow, ow...)" He massaged his shoulders. Some workout may do the trick, he figured. He took a deep breath and relaxed his tense body. Just before he could begin a simple kata, his stomach complained. Ranma was hungry.</p><p>Food always came first.</p><p>"(Where's pretty face when you need him?)" Looking around, Ranma trudged lazily and scratched his butt. Ryouga was usually up early, if not always. As he rubbed his eyes, he tripped on something and fell. Ranma figured it was a bucket, since there was a splash, not to mention that he got himself wet.</p><p>"Kueh!" Ranma struggled to get out of his shirt. 'Oh, great.' Ranma thought scornfully. 'And here I was calling it sweet and nice. That backstabber! I take it back!'</p><p>Ranma finally got himself out of his clothes. He took some quick bird steps towards Ryouga's tent. If Ryouga was not around, then he should be in there. That Ryouga wouldn't dare walk too far away from his camp. Once close enough, Ranma started to hear some voices. If he could smile with his beak, he probably would have done that.</p><p>"Stop! Shampoo, stop that! You're squeezing too hard!" came Ryouga's shout. He sounded flustered.</p><p>"Oooh! You like that, don't you?" came Shampoo's exclaim. She sounded excited.</p><p>Ranma stopped and blinked. Suddenly, he remembered his conversation with Shampoo from last night. Unfortunately, Ranma couldn't grin, either. He wanted to take a look.</p><p>Ranma quickly went to the tent's side and tried to take a peek. 'Holy shit.' Ranma's eyes nearly boggled out of their sockets. Inside, he could see a naked Shampoo all over Ryouga, literally. Ranma couldn't see much, though. She was giving him her back...</p><p>Ranma fidgeted a little bit, trying to get a better look. Unfortunately, he accidentally flipped the tent's covers a bit too much. Sunlight flickered inside the tent for a brief moment, but it was enough to draw the attention of both of them.</p><p>Shampoo turned her head towards Ranma slightly, and Ryouga shifted his upper body to take a look.</p><p>Ryouga and Shampoo found the head of a nervous-looking falcon staring at them.</p><p>Ryouga eyes lit up in anger. 'Saotome? That son of a bitch! How dare he see me in this humiliating situation? I ought to cook him for dinner!'</p><p>"You!" Shampoo yelled before Ryouga could. "I'll kill you!"</p><p>'Oh, shit!' Ranma cursed in his head and got the hell out of there.</p><p>Shampoo grabbed a shirt randomly, which happened to be Ryouga's, and went after the retreating falcon as she wore it.</p><p>Ryouga sat up calmly in mild confusion and sighed. "(I'm saved...)" Something inside him felt like it was about to break, though...</p><p>He finally got out of is tent to watch the commotion.</p><p>Ranma flapped his wings and tried to fly away, but before he could, a giant blade landed right next to him and embedded itself onto the ground, throwing him off balance. Ranma nervously got up again, eyeing the large sword warily. 'How the hell did she find the time to get that?'</p><p>Shampoo grabbed the hilt, carefully pulling the sword. "Hehehehe..." Her eyes gleamed dangerously. Shampoo held the sword above her, about to slash the bird in two. "Revenge!"</p><p>Ranma narrowly avoided her second slash and ran away.</p><p>"You're not getting away this time!" Shampoo followed her prey, never giving him the chance to fly away.</p><p>Mint eyed his opponent carefully. He blocked a low kick and quickly retreated a safe distance.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Lei Fan laughed. "Come and get me, tough guy!" She took some steps forwards and backwards, frustrating Mint.</p><p>Mint finally came forward with a jumping kick. Lei Fan smirked, parrying his kick and grappled him onto the hard ground, knocking him out.</p><p>"Perfect!" the TV flashed.</p><p>Mint dropped the controller in frustration. "I can't believe it!"</p><p>"Wow, 9‒0 and all perfects. You're pretty good at this," Lime commented at the victorious woman.</p><p>"Of course." She smiled smugly. "I'm the undefeated champion of the local arcade at our nearest town."</p><p>"Sounds exciting!" Lime brightened. "Hey, Mint! Let me try playing her."</p><p>"No!" Mint held the controller tightly. "I'm not giving up till I win!"</p><p>Lime frowned. "You're never going to win. Just let me try!"</p><p>"I don't wanna!" Mint rolled around like a big baby.</p><p>Lime grumbled. "Oh, fine. But just this one time!" He finally agreed.</p><p>Mint glared daggers at Lei Fan. "I'm not going to lose this time!"</p><p>Lei Fan simply rolled her eyes in response.</p><p>The Ghosts and Goblins theme song played loudly from the hand-held device as Ryouga fiddled with it furiously. He had been at the first stage for a while; the fact that it wasn't long was frustrating.</p><p>"(Stupid gargoyles! Die!)" Ryouga mashed the buttons in exhilaration. He was going to finish arcade mode even if it took him...</p><p>The death tune and game over music suddenly took over.</p><p>"(Shit!)" Ryouga nearly split his piece of electronics in two, but managed to calm himself down. He shifted his attention back to Ranma and Shampoo and found them still playing their game of deadly tag. Initially, Ryouga had enjoyed the show with an amused look, but it quickly got boring after the first 15 minutes.</p><p>Ryouga blinked as they both stopped to catch their breath for a moment. Ranma was the first to recover and took the chance to fly away. Shampoo soon followed after spewing some Chinese curses that didn't happen to be a part of his vocabulary yet.</p><p>Ryouga shrugged and pressed start.</p><p>Liang hit it off with his other two partners at the local pub. Actually, his partners were totally smashed at the moment, so he was enjoying the peace and quiet for a change.</p><p>"Ah, my love!" Chen wailed in a sudden outburst, but slumped back onto the table, in a loud snore.</p><p>So maybe it wasn't that quiet... On the other hand, Chen's train of thought wasn't that far off from his own. That woman had been occupying his mind for the past few days. She was quite the mysterious one...</p><p>"Liang!"</p><p>Liang looked up and found an older man heading his way.</p><p>"Ah, Mr. Wong." Liang smiled. "It is good of you to join us."</p><p>"I wouldn't dream of passing up this opportunity," Wong answered back and took a seat at their table. "Did I miss a party or something?" he asked, indicating at Chen and Shui.</p><p>"Not...quite." Liang sighed.</p><p>Wong simply laughed his own inquiry off. "So, what's new?"</p><p>"Not a lot to be frank." Liang gulped from his cup.</p><p>"That's it? We finally get to sit and talk and that's all you have to say?" Wong grumbled. "Didn't you get to meet a woman or something?"</p><p>Liang raised an eyebrow at that. "As a matter of fact, I did," he answered honestly.</p><p>"Oh?" Wong urged him to continue.</p><p>"Quite the mysterious girl, she was. She completely baffles me."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean? Wong asked in confusion. "You mean she's too pretty?"</p><p>"Indeed." Liang put down his glass loudly. "Rather than simply pretty, she was much beyond that. She was stunning, so to speak."</p><p>"Sounds like an amazing girl." Wong looked at him seriously. "But you seem disturbed. What's the problem?"</p><p>"That is exactly the problem." Liang disdained. "Someone like her should be very popular. The fact the nobody knows her is concerning. Moreover, she gave me a Japanese name."</p><p>"Japanese?"</p><p>"Yes. Her Chinese was also very poor."</p><p>Wong frowned. "Yes, that is pretty weird."</p><p>"Indeed. That's a very interesting story." A woman's voice made them blink in surprise.</p><p>Wong was the first to respond. "Oh, Miss Kiima..."</p><p>"Please." She joined them at their table. "Tell me more..."</p><p>A small figure slumped around the woods in a daze. The little girl held her support stick tightly to the ground to regain her balance. She was tired to the bone, famished, and probably lost, too. Who would have thought that tracking one person could be so difficult? Plum certainly didn't!</p><p>Over the river, through the woods, to his side she went. But how much further did she need to go?</p><p>Plum sighed. She had run out of food not too long ago. She needed to find a village or a town, or <i>anything</i>. Otherwise, she would starve to death. She just needed to decide on a direction to pick. Plum worked the the gears in her tiny head. Those very gears reminded her of something important, though.</p><p>Plum frowned. She lacked the money to properly feed herself. She was doomed.</p><p>No! Plum would definitely get through this! She would meet the person who stole her heart, and there was nothing in this whole world that could stop her. Plum stood confidently.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Plum sighed again and trudged forward.</p><p>The dragon prince was having a bad day. For one, his mentors had been chewing him off like used bubblegum from morning until afternoon. Thank the heavens he finally finished dealing with them. For another... He now had his advisers to deal with.</p><p>Herb fidgeted uncomfortably on his large chair. Apparently, his advisers had something of utmost importance and had to summon his royal presence into the meeting hall. Unfortunately, he didn't like what they had to say.</p><p>"My lord," one of them suddenly started. "It is very obvious that Joketsuzoku and those wretched bird men are up to something."</p><p>"Indeed," a second adviser agreed. "We must take action! Two scout teams must be sent immediately to both territories, and-"</p><p>"Have you lot gone utterly mad?" Herb interrupted. "Doing that may provoke both tribes, and we do not even have solid proof. Are you trying to start a civil war?"</p><p>"But my prince," one of the old advisers calmly replied. "It would still be unwise to simply ignore the matter. Besides, it's only going to be a simple scouting trip, no hostile activity would take place."</p><p>"It is still too risky," Herb maintained. "Our soldiers are not well-versed on handling matters outside our walls. There is no telling what could happen."</p><p>"With all due respect, your highness, you worry too much. Our soldiers will be given special instructions beforehand. What could possibly happen?"</p><p>Herb wanted to groan. That kind of attitude was exactly what brought trouble. It was going take hours before a decision would be made at this rate.</p><p>Ranma flew back to where their camp was. He somehow managed to lose Shampoo; all he had to do now was change back before she got back. Ranma quickly spotted Ryouga and made a hasty descend at top speed.</p><p>"(Yes, yes! Almost...)" Ryouga was too busy fiddling with his game to notice the bird heading straight to him. "DIE- Urmph!"</p><p>In his haste, Ranma crashed violently right into Ryouga's face, sending Ryouga on his back.</p><p>"(Shit, no!)" Ryouga quickly got up and faced the small screen, only to find "Game Over" splattered all over it.</p><p>Ranma shook his small head and looked at Ryouga as he got up. Ranma hoped he didn't hit Ryouga too hard, because he looked like he was having some sort of seizure.</p><p>"(Fuck!)" Ryouga cried out. "(Fuck! <i>Fuck</i>! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!)" Ryouga thrashed around in a mad burst of frustration and banged his head, arms and legs on the hard ground. He quickly got up, and in blind rage, cried out whilst holding his head and unsteadily ran, ramming his head into a tree like a mad bull. Unsatisfied with ending its life, Ryouga charged into another tree, knocking it down. Ultimately, he got to his knees and yelled towards the heavens.</p><p>Ryouga had finally done it; he had finally attained the pinnacle of human frustration, and it didn't feel too hot.</p><p>Ranma stood still on his spot, frozen. He was freaked, but Ranma finally got the sense to back up slowly from the enraged boy. He was unsure as to what to do; he had never seen Ryouga like this before. On the other hand, he really needed to change back before Shampoo actually got to him, so had to do <i>something</i>.</p><p>Fortunately, Ryouga seemed to calm down as he sat back and started to grumble scornfully. "(I don't believe it... So close...)" He finally fixed his eyes on the frozen falcon and frowned. "(Oh, it's you,)" he simply said. Ryouga went into his tent for a moment and came out wearing a shirt and with a canteen in one hand. He opened it, spilling a portion of its contents on the bird's head.</p><p>Ranma blinked with his human eyes. "(Thanks...)" He muttered, unsure how to react.</p><p>Ryouga placed the canteen aside and sat in front of the nude boy. "(Saotome, you have some explaining to do.)"</p><p>"(Heh, I guess I do.)" Ranma figured he was talking about the deal with Shampoo. "(It's kinda a long story.)"</p><p>"(I think I have the time,)" Ryouga urged.</p><p>"(Well, it all started when me and pop-)"</p><p>"(For crying out loud, Saotome!)" Ryouga scowled. "(Have some dignity and put some clothes on first!)"</p><p>"(Oops. I forgot.)" Ranma got up and went for his borrowed clothes. They were still cold, but not wet enough to trigger his curse again.</p><p>Ryouga rolled his eyes as Ranma hopped with one foot, trying to put his pants on. Ranma successfully put his left leg in, but he found his right foot get stuck on the back pocket. Ranma lost his balance and fell on his back.</p><p>Ryouga looked in surprise with wide eyes for moment. Within seconds, he burst out laughing at he display.</p><p>"(Oh, shut up,)" Ranma yelled in annoyance. He quickly finished and came back to his previous spot. "(Okay, Ryouga. You just have to promise not to tell Shampoo about this.)"</p><p>"(About what?)"</p><p>"(About my curse, you dolt.)"</p><p>Ryouga scowled. ("Why the hell do I have to help you? You certainly didn't give two shits when you told Shampoo about mine.)"</p><p>"(Oh, man.)" Ranma grumbled. "(You still not over that?)"</p><p>"(No,)" he bluntly replied.</p><p>"(Jeez. Just promise me, okay? This is important.)"</p><p>"(Oh, whatever. Fine.)" Ryouga reluctantly agreed. "(I promise. Just spit it out already.)"</p><p>Ranma finally smirked at Ryouga's submission. "(Well-)"</p><p>"(Go heat some water while you're at it,)" Ryouga interrupted.</p><p>Ranma's smirk turned into a frown as he went to do what he was told. At least he was hungry, so might as well do it.</p><p>Plum breathed weakly as she crawled on the ground. "H-he...lp..." She muttered weakly. Her voice barely had any volume to it. Her throat was so dry, speaking was painful.</p><p>Pushing her small body along the dirt, Plum looked around for any signs of civilisation, people, <i>anything</i>. But even if there was anything out there that would save her, her vision was too blurry to take notice of it.</p><p>Her small figure finally slumped to a halt, as fatigue's raging fist of fury knocked her out into bliss.</p><p>"Hey, man. You don't have to be such a sore loser." A much larger figure approached her fallen form.</p><p>"I'm not! Just, just shut up, okay? I don't want to talk about it." Another smaller boy walked by his side.</p><p>"See? You are being one." The larger boy laughed.</p><p>"I said drop it, Lime!" Mint scowled. It was bad enough when he lost to that Joketsuzoku woman, but he felt just awful when Lime beat him later, too. At least Lime couldn't beat her, either. That made him feel slightly better, but not by much.</p><p>Looking away from his partner, Mint came to a sudden stop. "Lime, look!"</p><p>Lime turned to find Mint pointing at something. "What is it?"</p><p>"I think it's a person." Mint edged closer to the fallen figure. "Looks like it's a girl," he said upon closer inspection.</p><p>Lime poked her with a stick. "Is she dead?"</p><p>Mint sweatdropped at his actions. "Stop that!" He slapped away Lime's stick. "She's breathing." Mint flipped her on her back and looked her over.</p><p>"Hmm." Lime knelt next to her. "I haven't seen a little girl before," he commented.</p><p>"Me neither."</p><p>Lime reached with his hand and rubbed her face. "Her skin feels nice..."</p><p>Mint quickly slapped Lime's hand away. "Stupid, don't do that!" he yelled angrily. "You need to be more gentle..." Mint gently rubbed her small delicate face. It <i>did</i> feel nice...</p><p>Lime grumbled something under his breath. "So what should we do?"</p><p>Mint stopped what he was doing and turned to face Lime. "Well, we still have patrol duty, but we can't just leave her like this."</p><p>"I guess not." Lime took a moment to think. "I say we wrap up already and take her back with us."</p><p>"Eh?" Mint looked at the girl and then back to Lime. "We're on duty right now. What if someone is out here?"</p><p>"What are the chances of that happening?" Lime countered casually.</p><p>"Are you kidding me?" Mint looked astonished. "We just found someone right here!"</p><p>"Well, it can't happen twice in a row, can it?" Lime looked proud of his argument, much to Mint's annoyance.</p><p>"Tell you what," Mint said with an irritated look, "You take her back while I finish up here. There isn't much left to do anyway."</p><p>"Okay, sounds like a plan." Lime nodded.</p><p>The two stood there for a few seconds wordlessly looking at each other.</p><p>"What the heck are you waiting for? Go already!" Mint yelled.</p><p>"Uh, right." Lime grabbed the unconscious girl by her collar.</p><p>Mint quickly held Lime's hand before he could lift her up. "Not so rough!" Mint frowned. "You could literally break her in two! Be more gentle." Mint couldn't stress that enough.</p><p>"Right." Listening to his partner, Lime switched his hold to under her armpits and slowly lifted her above the ground with minimal strength. He twisted her around a bit before carrying her on his back. "I'm good to go."</p><p>Mint nodded. "I'll see you in a little while then."</p><p>Ranma narrowed his eyes at Ryouga in annoyance. He had just finished telling the other boy his tragic tale moments ago, and Ryouga certainly showed some compassion as he had hoped, but Ryouga's method wasn't exactly how he wanted it expressed.</p><p>"(Would you shut up already?)" Ranma finally exclaimed. "(I regret I ever told you!)"</p><p>Ryouga felt like he could die. He rolled, kicked, and punched the ground in sheer hilarity. He was laughing his head off like never before.</p><p>"(Oh, but- Hahahaha!)" Ryouga was in too much pain to word his sentences properly. "(That's just- Haha! That's too damn hilarious!)"</p><p>Ranma fumed for a minute before finally got pissed off. "(Would you<i> quit it</i>?)" He punched the hysterical Ryouga in the face.</p><p>Ryouga finally stopped. He paused for a moment before feeling his left cheek. "(Thanks. I needed that.)" Ryouga still had an annoying grin, though. "(So let me get this straight,)" he restarted. "(You and your dad get cursed, you decide to desert him of all things, and then you go on spending your time with some Chinese prince or whatever. Of course, and all the while you keep tormenting Shampoo at her village and <i>stealing</i> her things.)"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "(That about sums it up, yeah.)"</p><p>Ryouga frowned. "(I knew you were a moron, Saotome, but this is really bad. What the hell were you thinking?)"</p><p>"(Who you calling a moron?)" Ranma yelled. "(I already told you,)"</p><p>"(Yeah, yeah. You weren't thinking straight and a bunch of other crap.)" Ryouga picked his ear nonchalantly. "(Doesn't stop you from being an idiot.)"</p><p>Ranma scowled at Ryouga's response. "(Oh, yeah? At least I'm not the one who's in love with himself!)"</p><p>"(What was that?)" Ryouga looked bewildered at Ranma's retort. "(What the hell is that supposed to mean?)"</p><p>"(Think ya can fool me, Ryouga? I've seen how you look at yourself in your cursed form.") Ranma smirked sharply.</p><p>Ryouga looked perplexed at his ridiculous claim. "(Sh-Shut up! I am <i>not</i> in love with myself; I'm not some weirdo like you, you pervert!)"</p><p>"(What was that, <i>princess</i>?)" Ranma sneered at him.</p><p>"(You wanna <i>fight</i>, Saotome?)" Ryouga sneered back.</p><p>"(Whatcha gonna do, pretty face, slap me to death?)" Ranma provoked him with his trademark smirk. "(Or maybe crush me with your tits?)" He laughed as he made fun of him.</p><p>Ryouga growled in anger. How dare he make fun of him! He was about lunge at the other boy with a punch to the face, but he had a sudden realisation. Completely disregarding his previous plan, he folded his arms, sat back, and chuckled eerily at his nemesis. Ryouga was going to get back at Ranma, and get him good. "(Oh, I don't know about that...)"</p><p>Ranma's smirk was shattered at the lost boy's change in behaviour. He had a bad feeling... "(Wh-What's that supposed to mean?)"</p><p>Ryouga looked at him in the eye with a mad expression. "(I don't have to do anything, Saotome. I'll just expose you to Shampoo!)"</p><p>"(What?)" Ranma looked shocked for a moment, but got angry afterwards. "(That's cheating! You just promised not tell!)"</p><p>"(I did? Whenever did I do that?)" Ryouga let out an insanely loud laugh.</p><p>Ranma pulled Ryouga by his shirt threateningly. "(This so ain't funny! I'm gonna kill you if you ever tell Shampoo about this!)"</p><p>Ryouga only grinned like an idiot in response. "(Not before Shampoo kills you first!)" he exclaimed nonchalantly, causing Ranma to turn pale.</p><p>"Have you two seen where that bird went?" a loud shout interrupted their verbal battle.</p><p>The two boys looked at the tired Shampoo before looking back at each other. One smiled while the other frowned.</p><p>Speak of the devil and he shall appear!</p><p>"Why, Shampoo, it's good to see you back," Ryouga said with a happy look once she got closer, completely disregarding her state of dress in his glee.</p><p>Shampoo's expression of irritation suddenly changed to fluster. "You, you are?" She fiddled with her petite fingers.</p><p>Ryouga looked between the Chinese girl and the nervous pony-tailed martial artist. "Yeah, because you won't believe what this good for nothing bum just told me." Ryouga eyed his arch nemesis carefully, savouring the situation.</p><p>Shampoo, on the other hand, ended her fluster and frowned at the last bit Ryouga mentioned, looking disappointed. "What is it?" she asked without much interest.</p><p>Ranma felt a trickle of sweat drop down his face. He shifted the focus of his eyes rapidly between the larger boy and the smaller girl. 'Ryouga, that traitor! He's gonna tell her!' Ranma, of course, wasn't in a perfect state of mind to realise that Shampoo was merely irritated and mistook it for something else. 'And Shampoo looks pissed! Shit, I'm screwed.'</p><p>Ranma slowly dragged himself backwards with his hands. He couldn't get far before a strong arm latched around his neck and pulled him to Ryouga's chest.</p><p>"You see, good old Saotome here is..." Ryouga paused to look down at Ranma's unsettling eyes and grinned at him when Ranma moved his glance to Shampoo. "...actually not so insensitive for once and said he'd cook us lunch! Isn't that just awesome?" Ryouga ravished.</p><p>Ranma froze like a statue for some moments before releasing air he didn't realise he was holding.</p><p>"Yes, that is great..." Shampoo blinked a few times, unsure if she was seeing the whole picture. "So, you mean you need some of my supplies?"</p><p>"Yes, that would be helpful." Ryouga finally let Ranma go. "Isn't that right, Saotome?"</p><p>"Uh, yeah! That would be great!" Ranma finally stood up, trying to look normal. "Bring whatever I could use and let's get to work!" Ranma quickly dashed to set up everything near the heated water.</p><p>"All right," Shampoo agreed. "Just let me change into my clothes first."</p><p>The two boys examined her, as if noticing her clothes for the first time. Shampoo was still wearing Ryouga's shirt obviously. On the other hand, it was so big on her, it looked like a weird dress, and the sleeves completely covered her arms, which also rendered her hands invisible. The fact the Shampoo was merely nigh naked thanks to that piece of fabric raised some uneasiness.</p><p>"Uh, right." Ranma quickly turned away, continuing to Ryouga's stove.</p><p>Ryouga lied down sideways, trying to ignore Shampoo. He rested his head on his right fist as he watched Shampoo move away to her tent at the corner of his eye, and then, once she was far enough, grinned at Ranma's back. "(Yeah, get to work.)"</p><p>Ranma looked behind him and gave Ryouga a glare of death. "(You're gonna pay for this later, Ryouga,)" he threatened.</p><p>"(I already am. Who do you think paid for the food?)" he asked. "(Now get back to work.)"</p><p>Ranma remained eyeing him until he heard Ryouga yell, "Hey, Shampoo!"</p><p>Ranma quickly turned around.</p><p>"Bring some salt, will you?" Ryouga requested, remembering that he ran out of salt earlier. Of course, he had to do it in way to throw Ranma off. He was enjoying this way too much.</p><p>Ranma grumbled a curse as he added more to the water cooking into the pot and dumped some rice in there. He couldn't believe Ryouga was taking advantage of his problem, but Ryouga proved himself to be a gigantic tosspot. Ranma wasn't going to let it just slide, though. He would think of something to get back at him, and when he did, he wasn't going to let him off easily.</p><p>Ranma sniggered for a few moments before Ryouga yelled at him.</p><p>"(Stop daydreaming and get back to work!)"</p><p>Ranma broke out of his train of thought and worked his hands in annoyance. Ranma noted Shampoo placing her bag of salt next to him and a frying pan. He held the frying pan for a moment, looking at it curiously. He placed it down and lifted a small wooden box that happened to be next to the stove. "(What the heck is this?)" Ranma opened it to find what he recognised to be those egg cartons placed upside down. Removing them, he found three eggs placed on another carton with a bunch of cotton around the eggs. 'Must be to prevent them from getting crushed,' Ranma thought.</p><p>Ranma put the frying pan to good use and promptly scrambled whatever was left of Ryouga's egg box. He wanted to get this over with quickly. Besides, he was still hungry.</p><p>Ryouga smiled at Ranma's back with sheer satisfaction, but frowned afterwards. He couldn't be satisfied yet! Ryouga needed to do more, much more to make the life of his enemy as miserable as possible. But of course, not today. After eating, they were going to need to head to a town to resupply; they were running low on food. That was entirely Ranma's fault, of course. That oaf ate as much as three people by himself. He figured he'd yell at Ranma about it later. There was also the issue of buying new clothes. A few more transformations, and Ryouga would be without any shirts. That was confidential information, though. Who knew what would happen if everybody knew Ryouga was running out of shirts? That would be dangerous information in the wrong hands...</p><p>But for now, Ryouga would be too busy eating what would probably be the only meal for this day. Dealing with those issues would come afterwards.</p><p>Idly, he reached for his hand-held device to kill the time. Ryouga sat up, turning it on. The game over message greeted him in response. Taking it as a challenge, he scoffed and began to restart the game anew.</p><p>"What's this thing?" Shampoo took a peek beside him, attracted by the weird music.</p><p>Ryouga glanced at her way in mild nervousness. She was a bit too close for comfort... He could feel Shampoo's hair brush just under his nose as she cocked her head above the screen. Her arm right arm lightly touched his own whilst supporting her weight on the ground.</p><p>"It's a game," he simply replied, unsure how to say video game in her language; not that it mattered much. Thankfully, she didn't try to do anything this time. Ryouga tried to ignore her, and he turned back to the object of his attention. The uneasiness Shampoo caused was quickly forgotten as a bearded knight in armour appeared on the screen.</p><p>"Hmm, interesting..." Shampoo muttered as Ryouga played. She watched intently as the knight ran and jumped around humorously, fighting a ridiculous horde of monsters and all sorts of vile creatures.</p><p>Ranma grumbled something after a quick glance at the couple. They were having fun playing games while he did all the work. The nerve of them!</p><p>Ranma ran around preparing some plastic dishes and other culinary tools as the food cooked. Ryouga surprisingly had a lot of junk in his pack that proved to be useful one way or another. He quickly went back to the stove before anything burned.</p><p>After several moments of running around between the stove and the dishes, Ranma sighed as everything readily lay before him. He looked away and snorted. "Come an' get it!" he yelled with a very noticeable lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>Looking back, Ranma found the couple sitting down in front of him, staring at his cooking.</p><p>"That's it?" Ryouga frowned in dissatisfaction. "Rice and eggs? Is that all you could come up with, Saotome?" Of course, Ryouga could not expect any better with the available food, but he had to piss Ranma off somehow. A distraught Ranma made a happy Ryouga.</p><p>"What are you complaining at me for?" Ranma yelled back. "Your food selection sucks!"</p><p>"Whose fault do you think is that?" Ryouga pointed sharply with his chopsticks. "You ate most of my food!"</p><p>"Oh, I'm so sorry, <i>princess</i>!" Ranma raised his hands exaggeratedly. "I just don't happen to be as delicate as you are!"</p><p>"(Wh, what did you say?)" Ryouga looked about to shoot lasers out of his eye sockets. "(You looking for a fight, you...you little...?)"</p><p>"Now, now!" Shampoo interjected with a smile. "No need to fight. Let's just eat, okay?" She held his arm to keep him seated.</p><p>Ryouga glanced at her, then glowered back at Ranma, and then finally turned to his meal. "Hmph."</p><p>Ranma picked his ear and did the same.</p><p>"Idiot." Ryouga started.</p><p>"Moron." Ranma retorted.</p><p>"Feather head."</p><p>"Pretty face."</p><p>"Bird brain."</p><p>"Girlie man."</p><p>"Chicken."</p><p>"Dairy cow."</p><p>Shampoo sighed. The two boys kept throwing insults like immature children. She ignored them and took a bite of the rice. "This rice is a bit undercooked."</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma put Ryouga aside for a moment, answering her. "Coulda used a bit more time too cook, but the gas ran out."</p><p>Ryouga scratched his head. "Huh? I had more fuel for the stove in my pack."</p><p>"All empty." Ranma took a bite.</p><p>Ryouga frowned. More reasons to visit a town... "I guess there won't be hot water for some time then." He looked at his rival sharply.</p><p>Ranma coughed on his food nervously and tried to ignore him.</p><p>The hidden meaning was yet lost to Shampoo's ears.</p><p>"Are there any towns nearby?" Ryouga asked Shampoo.</p><p>"Hmm..." Shampoo rubbed her index finger on her chin as she tinkered her brain. "The nearest town would be about a week away on foot, but there's a small village a day away from here."</p><p>"Good. We'll stop at the village first," he concluded. "We need a place with a bank or stores that accept credit cards, but the village may supply us with enough food for the trip. I don't have much money on me."</p><p>"You mean we absolutely ain't got nothing left to eat?" Ranma frowned.</p><p>"I have some emergency food in my pack, but that's not intended for three people," Ryouga replied. "And even with that..."</p><p>"I have some food," Shampoo suddenly added. "I could share it. There's not much, but it should be enough, yes?"</p><p>"That would be good." Ryouga appreciated her offer, much to her delight.</p><p>Ranma crossed his arms in mild annoyance; he was starting to feel like a parasite... But a day with hardly any food? That felt like a nightmare. No, no. It was only a day; how hard could it be? Hunger wasn't going to get the best of him. 'No, sir,' he thought.</p><p>"Okay, time to head out." Ryouga stood up. "Shampoo and I will take down our tents. Saotome, you put everything back into my pack and make sure the fire is completely dead."</p><p>Ranma blinked, registering his instructions. "What, you mean right now?"</p><p>"We don't have any time to waste, Saotome, so get moving." Ryouga walked away. "And bring some more water while you're at it."</p><p>Ranma reluctantly did as he was told with little to no complaints. He might as well save his breath, as it seemed like it was going to be a long day; a very long day.</p><p>Herb stomped loudly within the corridors of his majestic palace. He had a frown on his face that looked as if it was engraved on his skull. On the occasion of coming across any of his loyal subjects, they would scatter, standing still like statues until the prince was well away from sight and hearing range.</p><p>Not that Herb cared how his servants behaved at the moment. He was in the foulest of moods, and his underlings were the least of his worries.</p><p>"Utter fools!" the prince growled. His advisers certainly knew how to annoy him. After hours upon hours of debate, he had agreed to handle the matter himself. Those wretched old men were persistent. Whilst he was against the whole idea of sending troops, it was true that he couldn't completely ignore the issue either.</p><p>Herb's ill thoughts were pleasantly interrupted as he neared the door he was heading to.</p><p>"No! Stop that! Put it down!" a disorientated yell tore through the door. Some other mindless screaming came afterwards and the sound of something breaking.</p><p>"I told you not to mess with me!" It was a cutesy voice this time.</p><p>Herb was baffled. Was that a child's voice? Herb's frown deepened even further, if that was even possible. He quickly flung open the door and went in.</p><p>The room was complete mess. The beds were unkempt; the curtains were torn; and the floor was covered with food, water, broken glass, and smeared with...something disgusting-looking that the prince would rather not identify. The three stooges in the room continued their parade without regard to the prince, despite his rather noticeable entrance.</p><p>His two personal guards were cowering in the corner of the room like pathetic scared mice as a little girl threw apples at them from a basket.</p><p>"Stay away from me, you creeps!" she angrily yelled at them.</p><p>It was a sight Herb didn't see every day, or any other day for that matter. The prince didn't care enough to savour the occasion, either.</p><p>"What in blazes are you fools doing?" Herb yelled with contempt. The room suddenly quieted down and all eyes were on him.</p><p>"P-prince Herb!" Mint was the first to recover, looking nervous. "Um, this is, uh..."</p><p>Herb could almost feel his eye sockets shoot arrows. "I do not remember turning this into a daycare centre. Who is this <i>girl</i> and what is she doing inside the palace?" He pointed at their guest. "Explain yourselves!"</p><p>Lime and Mint quickly scrambled to their feet.</p><p>"Uh..." Lime tried to sort his thoughts as Herb waited patiently for his explanation with his arms crossed. "You know how we had patrol duty a while ago? Well, we were walking around to see if everything was okay and stuff. We went from place to place and it was <i>really</i> <i>boring</i> and, well, and Mint was still feeling bummed after getting beat by that Joketsuzoku woman in some video game, so he wasn't much fun chatting with, you know? So I had this plan to try and get him to get over it, and as we-"</p><p>"Ugh." Herb ran his hand across his face. "Just get to the point!"</p><p>Mint elbowed Lime's side.</p><p>"Sir, while we were on duty we found her lying unconscious on the ground and we decided to bring her here. You could say she was a bit...resistant when she woke up, prince," Mint explained thoroughly.</p><p>"Hmm." Herb scanned the room once more. "Indeed. And why did you not report this matter to the commanding guard?"</p><p>"Oh, you know how that guy is!" Lime waved his hand at the idea. "All trespassers are to be sent off to jail accordingly," he said in a badly mimicked deep voice. "She's just a kid!"</p><p>Herb gave the two a glare and they quickly stood still in silence. He turned to the small girl, causing her to step back from his ferocious scowl. But that did not stop Herb from walking towards her. For a few moments, he towered before her scared little figure.</p><p>The two boys observed nervously from the edge of their eyes.</p><p>"What do you think he's gonna do?" Lime asked, looking worried.</p><p>"How should I know?" Mint replied, looking similarly concerned.</p><p>Herb swiftly reached out to her and she closed her eyes and cringed, expecting a strike. Instead, she felt something soft rub on her cheek. Cracking an eye open, she found the prince in a crouch, wiping something off her cheek.</p><p>"You have something on your face," Herb calmly pointed out, now with a <i>slightly</i> gentler looking face.</p><p>Lime and Mint simultaneously released their held breath.</p><p>"He scared me there for a moment," Mint told his partner.</p><p>Lime simply nodded.</p><p>Finished, Herb stood back up and went to face his two servants.</p><p>"Now then..." Herb started, and the two listened carefully. "There is going to be a special mission assigned to two teams. I am going to have the two of you to participate in each team."</p><p>"What kind of mission, prince?" Mint asked, earning his attention.</p><p>"Scouting," Herb crossed his arms. "However, I actually need you two to prevent anyone from doing anything utterly foolish."</p><p>"So basically, you want us to lead the two groups and keep an eye on them," Mint concluded.</p><p>"Indeed." Herb nodded.</p><p>"Sounds kinda fun," Lime perked. "When do we leave?"</p><p>"First thing tomorrow morning. Make sure to prepare thoroughly before then." Herb looked about to leave.</p><p>"Um, prince?" Mint started innocently.</p><p>"Yes?" Herb turned back to Mint.</p><p>"What about...her?" Mint sheepishly pointed at their little guest, who looked a bit wary of the attention.</p><p>"Hmm?" Herb glanced at her for a moment before going back to Mint. "She..." He paused. "What is her name?"</p><p>Mint blinked. "That's a good question."</p><p>"What is your name?" Herb asked her.</p><p>"Uh, I, um," she looked too lost in her nervousness to answer, but eventually... "P- Plum."</p><p>"Come here." Herb gave Plum his left hand.</p><p>"Y- Yes..." Plum slowly accepted his open palm.</p><p>"I will handle her," Herb turned to his servants before leaving with the girl in hand. "The two of you worry about tomorrow."</p><p>As Herb exited past the door, he stopped to look around before yelling, "Guard! Guard!"</p><p>It didn't take long before one arrived in a hurry.</p><p>"Yes, prince!" He crouched in respect.</p><p>"I will be eating early today. Go tell the cook to prepare something for me and my guest at once."</p><p>"H- Her?" The guard stared at Plum.</p><p>"Is there a problem?" Herb glowered.</p><p>"N- n- no! Right away, prince!" He quickly left running.</p><p>"Come." Herb ordered Plum before going on their way, finally leaving Lime and Mint.</p><p>"Um..." Lime looked at Mint. "Do you think Prince Herb has a soft spot for kids or something?"</p><p>"I wonder..." Mint stared the doorway.</p><p>Half a minute passed before quickly turning to each other.</p><p>"Nah!" They both brushed the thought out of their heads.</p><p>Ranma took a large swift leap backwards, not long before a huge stream of raging flames fell down to burn the earth. Ranma steadied himself on solid ground and held the hilt of his sword tightly.</p><p>"Prepare yourself, Red Dragon!" Ranma exclaimed bravely at his fearsome adversary. "You ain't takin' me down that easily, you overgrown lizard!"</p><p>Ranma in his majestic red armour carefully circled around his foe. The giant red dragon roared in rage before the red knight. The ferocious beast was easily four times the size of the biggest elephants. As if to retort, it spat a speeding fireball from its mouth towards him in contempt.</p><p>Ranma barely avoided the second strike with another leap. "Keh!" he grunted as he returned to solid ground. "Time to end this, barbecue breath!"</p><p>"Majinken!" Ranma's sword flickered momentarily as he swung it, sending a wave of destructive energy towards the dragon.</p><p>The dragon's massive figure was too slow to avoid the attack and took the blow head on. The creature staggered and roared in agony and anger, leaving itself open to further attacks.</p><p>"Heh. That'll teach ya not to mess with me." Ranma smirked.</p><p>Not wasting the opportunity he made, Ranma griped his sword and leapt all over the dragon's huge body. Ranma made one final jump from its torso to stab his blade into its left eye socket.</p><p>Presented with more pain, the red dragon waved its head around in attempt to shake off the red knight, but Ranma was too stubborn to let go so easily. Eventually, the dragon made the grave mistake of lowering its head. This chance was exactly what Ranma hoped for.</p><p>Pulling the sword from where the dragon's eye used to be, the red knight lunged towards the dragon's neck.</p><p>"Majinken!" Ranma slashed with his sword at its neck, giving the dragon the devastating results of Ranma's Majinken at point blank range. The red dragon never felt it; its head was severed immediately from the rest of its body. The red dragon was dead.</p><p>"How was that?" Ranma landed perfectly on his feet, but the ordeal wasn't quite done yet, though. "Oh, shit!" Ranma scowled at the red beast's wobbly figure. He was about to get crushed by the dragon's falling corpse; if nothing was to be done, his victory would have been meaningless.</p><p>Ranma quickly worked his feet and tried to run around it. Just before the body completed its fall, Ranma barely leapt to safety.</p><p>The crash to earth made a grand noise and rose the dust to a high level.</p><p>"That was a close one." Ranma coughed as he waved a hand around the dusty air.</p><p>Once the dust finally cleared a few moments later, Ranma put on his smirk and walk over to the headless corpse.</p><p>"Heh. Gotcha good there, ya sucker." Ranma stepped with one foot on his trophy. It was a tough beast, but no match for the great Ranma. They didn't call him the Blazing Red Knight of Hell for nothing after all. Ranma had a reputation to live up to and wasn't about to disappoint.</p><p>He briefly wondered if dragons were edible...</p><p>"Ahem," Ranma cleared his throat with his right fist raised to his mouth. There were more important matters to tend to. He smirked once more and faced a tall tower that he had chose to momentarily ignore in order to battle the dragon.</p><p>The thing seemed to stand tall up to 30 metres. Atop it, there was a large balcony occupied by a single person. A beautiful young girl clad in a majestic white dress blessed the red knight with her intent gaze. Her sparkling eyes were more beautiful than diamonds, and her skin seemed purer than the blue skies of the heavens. She had short silky black hair, but most of her large bangs were held firmly by a crown of pure gold. Finally, the grand angelic dark wings on her back marked her as a gift from the gods to the mortals; but sadly, ugly chains of steel bonded them together in a monstrous grip.</p><p>"Princess!" Ranma exclaimed. "I have slain the dragon!" He raised his fist towards her in victory.</p><p>Even from such a height, Ranma could still see the princess' happy smile shine rays of light down his soul.</p><p>"Sir Knight!" she cheerfully exclaimed her joy.</p><p>Ranma sheathed his sword and ditched the slain dragon to stand below her balcony. "You can come down now, princess! It's safe! I whacked 'im good!" Ranma yelled.</p><p>"I can't!" The princess responded, twisting her brows. "There is no way down! And I cannot..." She weakly moved her chained wings as if to prove her point.</p><p>"Eh," Ranma paused to think. "I know! Princess, jump!"</p><p>"What?" The princess looked worried and confused.</p><p>"Don't worry! I'll catch ya!" Ranma raised his arms.</p><p>Still, his princess couldn't help but to worry. "But...!"</p><p>"Trust me!" Ranma waved both hands.</p><p>The princess looked down at her knight in contemplation. The warrior's firm confident look eased her. Without hesitation, she stepped on the edge of the balcony and jumped for her freedom. She clutched her dress and tempted to fight the wind to open her eyes.</p><p>"Heh. She actually did it," Ranma chuckled, readying himself. He waited patiently for the right moment before elegantly making a massive jump, swooping his princess into his strong arms and landing gently on solid earth.</p><p>"Sir Knight!" The princess cheerfully smiled as her knight in shining armour brought her gently to her feet.</p><p>"See? I told ya I'll get ya," Ranma said confidently, earning a light chuckle.</p><p>The chains on the princess' wings rang against each other as she moved, grabbing Ranma's attention.</p><p>"Here, let me get rid of those for you." Ranma moved behind her, and she obliged by lowering her dark wings. He grabbed the chains with his hands and easily ripped them apart. "There you go."</p><p>The princess stretched open her grand wings for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. The broken chains slid off of her without hassle. She felt great relief to be finally rid of them.</p><p>"Thank you!" She turned to face her saviour with a face of gratitude.</p><p>"Ain't nothin' to it!" Ranma smiled back. He really didn't feel like he deserved her thanks. "Just doin' my duty, princess."</p><p>"Sir Knight..." The princess shyly closed in on him, finally putting her hands on his hard armour.</p><p>Ranma felt his face heat up a bit as she looked at him with her blushed face. His hands automatically placed themselves on her shoulders.</p><p>"Princes..." Ranma spoke softly to her.</p><p>"Sir Knight..." she responded in a similar tone.</p><p>"Princess..." Ranma felt himself edge closer to her face. He didn't know what he was doing; he felt like he was possessed by the demons of the netherworld.</p><p>"Sir Knight..." The princess closed her eyes. Soon after, her knight's lips came down to seal her own.</p><p>Ranma didn't know what he was doing; he simply let himself follow his instincts. He ascended his hands to hold her face in his palms. Ranma's lips seemed like to have been set ablaze. He felt her glamour sweep into him as she fully accepted his kiss.</p><p>Time seemed to stop around them. The only thing that mattered to them was each other. Ranma's need for air seemed unnecessary as he ignored it to remain bound with his princess. The both of them chose to ignore the world to explore each other.</p><p>They remained that way for some time before their moment eventually came to an end.</p><p>The princess and knight took a long glance at each other. The princess was the first to break it sticking close to him. The red knight responded by moving his arms to tighten them around her.</p><p>Ranma felt happier the past moments that ever in his life. The princess was the source of light and warmth to his life now. There was no way he would let her go now.</p><p>Absolutely no way.</p><p>Ranma suddenly woke up to a stand, breathing hard.</p><p>"(What the hell?)" Ranma looked around to find himself in Ryouga's tent. He rubbed his forehead in an attempt to clear his head. "(What kind of messed up dream was that?)" Ranma quietly wondered.</p><p>Ranma felt a shiver run down his spine as he remembered the last bit of his dream. It was incredibly vivid. If he didn't know any better, he would've said it really had happened.</p><p>That princess was the spiting image of that bastard Ryouga. No, it really <i>was</i> Ryouga in his cursed form. Ranma paled as much as his face looked disgusted. But then he found another frightening problem; he didn't really <i>feel</i> disgusted, which made him feel disgust at himself for not feeling disgusted.</p><p>Ranma still didn't believe how real that dream felt. He quietly sat in the dark tent for some moments, his head empty of any thoughts. His hand raised itself to touch his lips with the tip of his fingers.</p><p>Ranma felt his face irritatedly heat up like a teakettle. He turned his head to find Ryouga sleeping soundly next to him without a care in the world. Feeling uncomfortable, he quickly escaped the tent to cool his head off.</p><p>The cool night breeze made him feel slightly better. Ranma walked over to a bush and dropped down his pants. He proceeded to urinate, exhaling in relief.</p><p>"(But, man...)" Ranma listened to the sound of his pouring urine. It helped him relax. "(That Majinken thingie was pretty cool. Wonder if it's possible...)" Ranma tried to remember how he pulled it off in his dream. Unfortunately, Ranma wasn't much of a swordsman; he only barely knew how to handle a sword, let alone create a technique from something he saw in a dream.</p><p>Ranma's train of thought inconveniently bounced him back to that dreadful dream. That was no mere dream; it was a nightmare of the worst kind. Though, he did look kind of cool back there, but that was besides the point! The point was that it was really wrong and shouldn't have happened. Ranma had the feeling that that dream would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>"(Eh, forget it...)" he told himself. It was probably the hunger affecting him. Ranma pulled his pants back on and walked back to Ryouga's tent. Without even thinking about it, he stopped himself before going in, frowning. Ranma couldn't do it; something about it made him feel incredibly uneasy. There was no way he could sleep in there, at least not this night.</p><p>Ranma groaned, moving away from the tent. He looked at the trees for a decent spot before remembering a very important fact. Ryouga's stove was useless at the moment and they were a bit low on water. Moreover, Shampoo was still around.</p><p>Ranma wondered if her people eat falcons for dinner. He shuddered at the thought.</p><p>Looking at the ground, he groaned once more at his new bed.</p><p>"Are we there yet?" Lime asked in boredom as he walked. He picked his ear with a pinkie whilst yawning and scratching his butt with his other hand. Morning came way too soon when there was duty to be done. The trip sounded new and exciting at first, but it didn't turn out to be that great. It was kind of boring, actually.</p><p>The Musk guard ahead of him returned a bewildered look at Lime's question. "We're not quite there yet." He looked at the map in his hands. "It looks like it's going to take us one more day to reach the birdmen's village."</p><p>Lime looked like he was about to cry. Why did prince Herb have to send him on this trip? He much preferred to spend his time at home, where he could play around with his new Joketsuzoku friends. Lime's thoughts stood still. They were prisoners! But what difference did it make? Lime shrugged.</p><p>Lime wondered how Mint was doing on his end. That guy took his work a bit too seriously. Maybe he was actually enjoying it for all he knew.</p><p>Lime chuckled and walked on.</p><p>"Are we there yet?" Mint sulked in annoyance. They had been walking for hours and there was still no sign of the village.</p><p>The leading guard looked back at him in mild puzzlement. "We're still too far away. We may reach the village tomorrow by noon."</p><p>What he had said bewildered Mint. It was not exactly what the young Musk was expecting to hear.</p><p>"Tomorrow?" Mint frowned. That was totally flabbergasting as it contradicted what the Joketsuzoku girls had told him. "Are you sure about that? The prisoners told me it took them about ten minutes to get here."</p><p>"Impossible." It was the guard's turn to look flabbergasted, bringing out his map. "There is absolutely no way for that to happen!" He showed Mint the map to explain. "Distance aside, the available roads make the usage of vehicles nigh impossible. Unless they flew here, there is no way to make it in such a short time."</p><p>Mint looked at the map in astonishment. Their story and the facts did not add up; they were either lying or something fishy was going on.</p><p>"Weird..." Mint muttered.</p><p>"I'm afraid you've been had, sir."</p><p>Mint frowned. Once he got back home, he would make them give him a proper explanation.</p><p>Mint trudged. He was a long ways away from returning home.</p><p>"Are we there yet?" Ranma complained in his hunger. He could hear his growling stomach complain in agreement. He was so hungry, he was sure he could eat a horse, or two. Okay, maybe three horses. He was that hungry.</p><p>Nevertheless, no matter how hungry he was, Ranma would be hard pressed for any pity or compassion from Ryouga.</p><p>"Would you shut the hell up?" Ryouga growled. Every time that stupid wanker Ranma opened his mouth, he had to resist the urge to pull out his own hair in frustration. "For the tenth time, no! Just shut up and walk!"</p><p>Ranma looked somewhat surprised that Ryouga had actually bothered to count. It was not like Ranma could help it, though; he was too hungry. The last thing he ate was a pack of Pocky, which he stole—no, <i>borrowed</i>—from Ryouga. That was hardly a meal.</p><p>"We will probably be there in a few hours," Shampoo revealed as she walked ahead of them without bothering to turn back.</p><p>Shampoo's words were something of a bittersweet revelation. On one hand, Ranma was about to eat something in a few hours; on the other, he needed to wait a few hours to eat something. It was a test of patience; something Ranma lacked.</p><p>"I'm so hungry..." Ranma looked at some rodents waltzing by the trees. "Those rats are looking awfully delicious right now," he muttered, remembering his days as a falcon.</p><p>"What was that?" Ryouga asked in confusion, thinking his ears were playing tricks on him.</p><p>"Uh, I said some delicious ramen would be great right now," Ranma quickly changed.</p><p>"Hmm..." Ryouga looked at him suspiciously for a few moments before dismissing it. 'Maybe I'm getting too hungry myself...'</p><p>Ranma trudged on whilst forcibly suppressing his hunger. About an hour later, he found some slight satisfaction in annoying Ryouga by forcing him to travel amidst his relentless complaints. That was hardly a distraction from his growling stomach, but it proved to be entertaining nonetheless. Besides, it was payback for the disturbing dream he had yesterday. Ranma cursed mentally as it returned to his thoughts. It was best he lock up that memory within the darkest depths of his brain and leave it there forgotten.</p><p>But on the subject of payback, Ranma still needed to figure something out regarding Ryouga's evil deeds in exploiting his curse. That bastard still dropped hints about his falcon curse around Shampoo every now and then. He was having fun way too much; no one had fun at the expense of Saotome Ranma. The price was going to be grand; too grand. He just need to figure out how much <i>too grand</i> was...</p><p>For the life of him, Ranma still had no idea for the weird sense of déjà vu he experienced whenever he thought about the subject...</p><p>A sudden gentle breeze brushed against Ranma's nose, feeding it the welcoming smell of freshly cooked food. Ranma screeched to a sudden halt. His primal instincts finally took over as he sniffed about.</p><p>Ryouga noticed something was wrong and turned back. He twisted his eye borrows in mild confusion as Ranma cocked his nose around like some sort of trained police dog. "(What the <i>hell</i> are you doing this time, Saotome?)"</p><p>Ranma ignored Ryouga and continued to try and figure out where the smell was coming from. "(There!)" Ranma exclaimed, and jumped into a sudden sprint.</p><p>"(Hey! Where do you think you're-)" Ryouga cut his own question short and ran after him.</p><p>Ranma couldn't care less who was running after him. All he cared about is moving ahead. He ran around the trees with much speed that would make a football player jealous. He ultimately came to a clearing, made a sudden stop, and looked around like an enraged berserker.</p><p>"(Food... Food...)" Ranma muttered. "(Where's the food?)"</p><p>Ranma's brain lacked any kind of rationale at the moment. It was a mere pawn that his stomach commanded.</p><p>"Stop! Thief!"</p><p>"Hmm?" Ranma turned towards the yelling. Two running figures immediately grasped his attention; or rather what was one of them carrying. It looked like a bowl of some kind. It was huge; the man seemed struggling by carrying it. It was amazing he was even running. However, the only thing that mattered was that it was probably full of goodies.</p><p>Whilst they were approaching him, Ranma didn't have the patience to wait for them and ran towards the pair.</p><p>The Chinese man made the mistake of looking back at his pursuer. As he looked ahead again, he was surprised to find Ranma swiftly grabbing the large bowl away from his grasp.</p><p>"I'll take that, bud!" Ranma proceeded to kick him away from his sight before he could react.</p><p>Now that he was out of the picture, Ranma had the chance to examine the bowl in his hands. It smelled even better this close to him! Curious, he opened the lid to discover its contents. It looked like it was a soup of some sort. Not that it mattered much what exactly it was; Ranma was starving and it looked delicious.</p><p>"Bottoms up!" Ranma raised the blow to gulp the contents down.</p><p>"Lad! Wait!"</p><p>Ranma paused for a moment. Someone was asking him to stop. Should Ranma stop or ignore him and wolf down the food? After three seconds of thinking, he figured no one was capable of taking his food away anyway.</p><p>Lowering the bowl again, Ranma found that the other man had finally caught up to him. A weird middle-aged man; possibly older than his pop.</p><p>"What do you want, old man?" Ranma held the bowl protectively. "I ain't giving this back," he stated boldly.</p><p>The Chinese man looked a bit worried and out of breath. "A young lad like yourself needn't eat that."</p><p>"Oh, yeah? Why not?" Ranma looked suspicious. This guy better not try pulling his leg.</p><p>"That is no ordinary bowl of soup," the man explained. "It is cooked with my family's secret ingredient, the Dragon's Whisker, following a recipe passed down for generations."</p><p>"The Dragon's what?" Ranma looked confused. What did that have to do with anything? So it was some sort of secret recipe, so what? That seemed more like another reason to try it out. Though, Ranma was intrigued. The old man may be on to something here. "That still doesn't answer my question."</p><p>"Yes, well..." he seemed to look for a way to put it. "This dish is usually served for older men as a sort of medicine."</p><p>"Medicine?" Ranma urged for more details.</p><p>"I suppose you could say it is used to fulfil a certain ambition shared amongst men."</p><p>"Really?" Ranma widened his eyes. He found that interesting. "You mean if I eat this mine would get... bigger?"</p><p>The Chinese man raised his eyebrows. "Bigger? Odd choice of a word, but I guess that is one way to put it, yes."</p><p>"That settles it then!" Ranma grabbed the spoon in the bowl and started to wolf everything in it down at blinding speed.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked shocked. Even after his warning, the lad still went and ate it. Ranma was already finished before he could even protest.</p><p>"Ah," Ranma exhaled. "That was good."</p><p>"Oh, dear..."</p><p>Ranma looked down at himself. "Northing's happening yet, pops. I don't feel different." He figured it took some time for it to kick in.</p><p>"Oh, my..." the man looked worried. "What have you done? This is a problem."</p><p>"(Saotome! You <i>idiot</i>!)"</p><p>Ranma casually looked behind him to find Ryouga running towards him in his usual blind rage, followed closely by Shampoo.</p><p>"(Don't just run off on your own, you moron!)" Ryouga yelled another insult.</p><p>Ranma didn't care much about what Ryouga thought. Ranma ate everything in the bowl first. No more was left for pretty face! That being the fact, Ranma simply responded with a happy smirk on his face.</p><p>When Ranma was finally in punching range, Ryouga prepared a fist to let out his frustration on his favourite punching bag, only to stop himself midway.</p><p>Ryouga looked directly at Ranma's face, frowning. "(Is it just me, or did your hair get longer?)"</p><p>It was Ranma's turn to frown. "Huh?" Ranma was confused. Though, some parts of his face and some spots around his neck did feel mysteriously ticklish... Ranma tried to pull back his ponytail to check his rival's suspicions, only to have something black blur and slap Ryouga in the face.</p><p>"Umph!"</p><p>"(What the heck?)" Ranma looked at his ponytail in astonishment. It seemed to have gotten longer than he was tall. When did it have the time to grow that long?</p><p>"(Watch where you're swinging that thing!)" Ryouga yelled angrily.</p><p>"What's going- Ermph!" Ranma didn't have the chance to ask before a lump of heavy hair blinded his vision and landed in his mouth.</p><p>Ranma spat out the hair and tried to brush it over his head. He attempted to ask once again, but he felt his hair shove down at him faster than he could blink. Ranma ran around like a blind bat as he screamed like a scared little boy.</p><p>Ryouga boggled as Ranma ran in circles with a mountain of hair that kept growing on top of his head. Ryouga had never seen something like that before; he was unsure how to react, but decided to settle by pointing and laughing.</p><p>"(Hahaha! Look at that!)" Ryouga laughed. There was no reason to be worried. It was only Ranma, and he deserved every bit of misfortune he got. It was easier to laugh at him than worry about him anyway.</p><p>"(Ryouga!)" Ranma growled, grabbing Ryouga by the collar. "(This is <i>not</i> funny! Do something!)"</p><p>Ryouga stopped to scowl at Ranma's face, or at least tried to. The only thing Ryouga managed to see was hair. He was a bit amazed Ranma managed to know where to grasp, much less find him.</p><p>"(Hmph. Why should I help you?)" Ryouga looked away, uncaring.</p><p>"(Oh, come <i>on</i>! Don't be such a dick!)" Ranma shoved him away and went to Shampoo. "Shampoo, you do something, too!"</p><p>"(That's a tree, Saotome.)" Ryouga flung some earwax off his pinkie.</p><p>"(Oh.)" Ranma turned around. "(Where's Shampoo?)"</p><p>Ryouga was quick in finding Shampoo. She was standing with some Chinese man, chatting their cares away profusely. It seemed that the two knew each other. Ryouga hated to interrupt their fun for Ranma's sake, but the problem was likely to extend to him somehow. That idiot Ranma was already hindering their progress.</p><p>With a decision, Ryouga finally walked over to Shampoo and hailed her. "Hey, Shampoo!"</p><p>The two of them looked his way. That worked well enough.</p><p>"Any idea what the hell is going on with him?" Ryouga asked, pointing behind him with his thumb. Ranma looked about to drown in his own hair not far away behind the lost boy. "It's starting to get out of hand."</p><p>"I think he ate the Dragon's Whisker," Shampoo replied in amazement. It was the first time she had actually seen it in action. She didn't think it would work that well.</p><p>"The what?" Ryouga frowned.</p><p>"The Dragon's Whisker is our family's secret recipe," the Chinese man steped in to explain. "It is supposed to grow hair on bald men. I tried to warn him, but... your friend seemed to eat a bit too much of it regardless of my warnings. If nothing is done, he will simply run out of hair."</p><p>Ryouga scowled further, turning around. "<i>Saotome</i>! You <i>bloody idiot</i>! Can't you think with your <i>brain</i> for a moment?"</p><p>Ranma suddenly burst out of his hair. "Hey! You didn't tell me nothing of the sort!" He would have went there to give him a piece of his mind, but Ranma was literally tangled up at the moment. "Somebody, get me outta here!"</p><p>"So, anyway to fix it?" Ryouga asked, ignoring Ranma. They needed to find a solution, even if the thought of a bald Ranma was absolutely hilarious.</p><p>"There is one possible way. Please follow me to my house." The Chinese man promptly led the way.</p><p>"(Come on, Saotome. We're going.)" Ryouga went back to Ranma.</p><p>"(Just a moment.)" Ranma struggled around his hair. "(Right behind ya.)"</p><p>"(Sure you are.)" Ryouga rummaged through the massive hairball for a few seconds until finding one of Ranma's legs. He proceeded to drag Ranma from his ankle.</p><p>Fortunately, they weren't forced into a long walk; the house was only about three minutes away. Ranma certainly made it feel like an eternity, though; and not just to himself. Ryouga had some trouble walking with all the hair trying to tie itself around his legs. It was incredibly annoying attempting to extricate himself every few seconds.</p><p>Now that the small house was visible, Ryouga followed the Chinese man and Shampoo inside, only to feel Ranma get stuck half way in. Ryouga pulled with some force, much to Ranma's disdain.</p><p>"(Hey! Watch it!)" Ranma yelled. "(That actually hurts!)"</p><p>"(Shut it.)" Ryouga made a sudden forceful pull.</p><p>"(YOW!)" Ranma cried out as a whole lot of hair got pulled out of their roots. The hairless spot almost immediately got patched up with hair again, though.</p><p>Ignoring Ranma, Ryouga turned back to the Chinese man, finding him rummaging through some cupboards. "So now what?"</p><p>"We use this," he said, turning back to foreigner with a strand of some sort of a thick string between his fingers.</p><p>"What is it?" Ryouga asked, puzzled.</p><p>"It's the Dragon's Whisker," Shampoo explained. "If you tie it to his hair, it should stop growing."</p><p>Ryouga took the Dragon's Whisker and examined it closely. It didn't feel or look special at all; it looked like any other string. "Hmm..."</p><p>"I'd hate to interrupt the chitchat, guys, but can you actually do it <i>now</i>?" Ranma complained.</p><p>Ryouga rolled his eyes and picked a strand of Ranma's hair at random. He tied the Dragon's Whisker to his hair, and...</p><p>"It stopped!" Ranma exclaimed. He sighed in relief for a moment before extricating himself from his hair. Ranma had some trouble standing with all the weight on his head.</p><p>Ryouga decided to end Ranma's joyous occasion for a bit and pulled the Dragon's Whisker out again.</p><p>"(Ryouga!)" Ranma panicked, his hair rapidly growing again. "(What the hell are you doing?)"</p><p>Ryouga snapped a pair of scissors in one hand, readying the Dragon's Whisker in another. "(Time for a haircut, Saotome,)" he explained.</p><p>Ryouga waved his arms around, and before anyone could blink, Ranma's hair was back to its original length, sans the abnormal growth.</p><p>"(That was quick,)" Ranma muttered. He moved his neck around, enjoying the weightlessness of his head for a second. Ranma pulled forward his ponytail to check I Ryouga remembered to keep that part, only to find something else. "A pigtail?"</p><p>Ryouga shrugged. "I figured a pigtail would be less likely to get loose by accident."</p><p>Ranma registered the explanation for a second and tucked the pigtail back. "Suppose I could use the new look anyway." There was still something Ranma wanted to ask, though. "Where'd you learn to cut hair like that?"</p><p>"(That's none of your business!)" Ryouga looked away, annoyed, much to Ranma's confusion.</p><p>'Now, what's pretty face hiding?' Ranma wondered with a smirk. Before he could shoot another question, Ryouga beat him to a question of his own.</p><p>"What the hell were you thinking eating that stuff anyway, you idiot?" Ryouga glowered.</p><p>Ranma frowned. It looked like Ryouga wasn't about to drop it any time soon. "Hey, I was hungry!" Ranma threw the first excuse he could think of.</p><p>"Hungry? Didn't you hear his warnings?" Ryouga started yelling. If there was one thing Ranma was good at, it was making Ryouga angry.</p><p>"His 'warnings' were pretty ambiguous!" Ranma yelled back. "How the hell was I supposed to know he was talking about my hair?"</p><p>That point begged for an obvious question.</p><p>Ryouga looked mildly puzzled. "Then what <i>did</i> you think he meant?"</p><p>"Uh..." That shut Ranma up. He'd be damned if he told Ryouga the truth. Ranma looked around to make a quick escape. The only exit was the door they came in and it was blocked by a massive amount of his hair. Ranma needed a distraction.</p><p>A wooden object was stuck amongst the hair, catching Ranma's eye. It seemed to be a spoon. Getting an idea, he resisted the temptation to smirk. That spoon would do more than enough.</p><p>Ranma warily backed himself towards the door. "Yer mummy's got an outie!" he exclaimed. It was a classical children's insult, but it seemed to do the trick.</p><p>Ryouga growled in rage. That bastard Saotome prefered to throw insults instead of taking him seriously. He even had the balls to insult Ryouga's mother while he was at it. He was going to <i>kill</i> him.</p><p>Forgotten in the background, Shampoo sighed pensively as the boys were about to start fighting again. She wished her husband's friend would stop provoking him all the time; they would probably have reached the village by now if they didn't constantly fight every few minutes. Though, Shampoo had to admit, her husband was kind of cute when he was angry.</p><p>"(Saotome! You rotten son of a- Omph!)"</p><p>Shampoo blinked as Ranma willy-nilly stuck a spoon into Ryouga's mouth. That was totally unexpected, and it seemed to work in calming Ryouga down; at least for the current moment.</p><p>Ryouga stood with a frown, flabbergasted. The idea of pulling out the spoon only registered to him moments later, and now he was holding it and staring at it intently. Something didn't feel right about this spoon...</p><p>Did Ranma think this cheap stunt was enough to throw Ryouga off? He was wrong; dead wrong. Just as Ryouga felt the anger returning to him, he searched the darkest depths of his mind to spit an eloquent insult on Ranma's face.</p><p>Strangely enough, the spoon—amongst other things—seemed to disappear behind a wall of darkness.</p><p>"What the hell is going on?" Ryouga cried out. He couldn't see! Ryouga instinctively let go of the spoon and brushed away whatever that was blocking his vision. He was glad to find out that his eyesight was still working. The lump of hair that he found himself grasping, on the other hand, didn't make him all too happy. It didn't take a genius to put two together to figure out what had happened.</p><p>"(<i>Sao...to...me</i>...)" Ryouga spat Ranma's name like an insult through his grit teeth. His eyes appeared to be a weapon of mass destruction that would destroy anything in its path. Unfortunately, Ranma was too busy running away to succumb to their wrath. "(<i>Saotome Ranma, prepare to die</i>!)" Ryouga pursued his mortal enemy.</p><p>Ranma laughed his head off as he ran. "(Come and get me if ya can, Ryouga!)" he provoked. Ranma took a peek behind him to find Ryouga charging at him like a raging bull. Ryouga looked absolutely <i>pissed</i>; it was just the way Ranma wanted it. That would teach him to mess with the great Saotome Ranma. "(Nice hairdo, Ryouga! I love it!)" Ranma sniggered at Ryouga's growing hair. It seemed to make him angrier, if that was even possible.</p><p>Ranma's danger sense suddenly kicked in; Ranma instinctively leapt to his left prior to finding a boulder slightly bigger than himself plant itself to the ground he was standing on. That was a close one.</p><p>"(Stand still and die, Saotome!)" Ryouga threw another boulder Ranma's way.</p><p>Ranma saw it coming this time, though. He evaded it without much effort. "(Is that all ya got, pretty face?)" Ranma taunted, sticking out his tongue. "(I could avoid your hits in my sleep with my arms tied behind my back!)"</p><p>Ryouga quickly abandoned his boulder plan in favour of planting his fist into Ranma's face. He resumed his pursuit, and Ranma naturally started running away again. That coward; he fled again instead of facing him like a real man! Ryouga expected no less from that spineless moron.</p><p>For once, Ranma tilted his head away from provoking Ryouga to look at where he was going, as the edge of his eye warned of something peculiar to come. Eyes widened, he suddenly skidded to a stop to stare off into a cliff. "(Oh, damn...)" It was pretty deep; deep enough to be quite unpleasant to fall into. Ranma turned back, finding Ryouga closing in on him. "(Man, that's not good.)" Ranma tried to think of a way out of this predicament. There was not much time for thinking, though. Ryouga was 10 seconds away from striking range. "(Now, now, Ryouga.)" Ranma put up his hands defensively. "(Hold on just a second here!)"</p><p>Ryouga was deaf to Ranma's words. If Ranma thought he could talk his way out of this now, he'd better think again.</p><p>Ryouga leapt with his arm arched backwards, fully intending on letting Ranma eat his fist.</p><p>Ranma reacted naturally, and jumped backwards, avoiding the punch. Fortunately, he landed just at the edge. Another close call from Ryouga. All he had to do now was jump over pretty face before he could recover and he would be in the safe zone.</p><p>However, Ryouga attack wasn't finished yet. His punch was devastating; it tore the solid ground to pieces.</p><p>Ranma looked solemn as what was once solid earth slip off below. "(Ah, shit!)" he cursed, attempting to regain his balance. Just when it seemed too late and the rocky platform he was on was falling, Ranma managed to jump back and grab onto the edge of the cliff with one hand.</p><p>Ranma looked down below to find the platform get smashed to pieces. Now he knew why climbers advised not to look down.</p><p>"(That was...)" Perhaps Ranma's grip was too strong; the spot he was holding on to tore, and he was once again falling down. Ranma looked nervously at the rock he was now holding in his hand, and then back at the peak of the cliff at seemed to ascend. "(...cloooooooooooooooo-)" Ranma finally quieted down after feeling a sharp pain show itself on the back of his head.</p><p>Back at the top, Ryouga carefully began to tread towards the edge. He looked down below with a scowl, finding Ranma lying unconscious at the bottom. "(Hmph. Serves him right,)" he commented.</p><p>Prince Herb ate his breakfast peacefully. It was a fabulous morning; a rare occasion of peace and quiet. The scouts had been sent an hour before his wakening, and his day had been progressively getting better. If he had known that sending half of the guards on missions would result in such a calm, he would have done so long before. There was a lack of noise; no pranks were being pulled by his fellow servants on each other for once.</p><p>One prank came to mind was when Lime decided it would be funny to put baby crocodiles into his peers' beverages. It had caused quite an uproar. Herb initially paid the tomfoolery no heed, but when he found one of those baby crocodiles swimming in his cup, he decided to give Lime a piece of his mind. Ever since then, food storage had always been heavily guarded against Lime sabotage.</p><p>Herb glanced at his guest whilst sipping his tea. He smiled as she ate with a happy look on her face. He had informed his mentors and advisers that he planned to get the 'day off'. Of course, such a thing was regarded as totally unacceptable, but they simply couldn't refuse the prince once he frowned at their disapproval.</p><p>Now, Prince Herb had an entire to day to spend leisurely with his guest. Just like peaceful mornings, having a guest was also a rare occasion; and he diligently treasured pleasant rare occasions. Herb needed to figure out how to spend this lovely day. There were tens of things that he wanted to do, but when strictly thinking about it, nothing really came to mind. It was weird.</p><p>"Hmm..." Herb worked his brain. "Plum, how is your food?" he asked her. It was a fabulous idea; why not ask Plum what she wanted to do? It would certainly be more effective than wasting all day with his indecisiveness.</p><p>"It's great, Herb!" she replied cheerfully. "I love it!" Plum really meant it. She wished her father could taste this. Herb was really nice, letting her eat such delicious food. Whilst he looked scary at first, he was wonderful once she got to know him! Strangely enough, everyone seemed to be scared of him. How could anyone not notice how sweet he was? Plum was only here for a short while and she seemed to know him better than anyone else. She really enjoyed every moment she spent with Herb. Totally unlike those two numbskulls...</p><p>"That is good." Herb decided to ask the decisive question. "Plum, what would you like to do today?"</p><p>"Hmm..." Plum thought about it for a moment. "This place is pretty big; how about taking a walk around?"</p><p>Yes, showing Plum around his royal home was probably one of the most obvious things he should do. It was a fascinating idea; why didn't Herb think of that before? Perhaps it was amidst the other mysterious tens of ideas he had locked in his mind. He was sure his ideas would come in time, and a walk with Plum just might help him with that.</p><p>"Very well," Herb agreed. "We shall do that once we are finished." He returned to his tea.</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>It was a fabulous morning indeed.</p><p>Ranma walked with an annoying pain at the back of his head. He wasn't too proud of himself at the moment. He would have been if it weren't for that blunder at the cliff. It was a pretty damn good comeback for all Ryouga's deeds of mischief, but it was all soiled because of one small minor misstep.</p><p>Feeling scornful, Ranma tried to glare at him through the corners of his eyes. It was just him and Ryouga now. After Ryouga tried to get the two of them back up, he had somehow gotten the two lost. Without Shampoo, they had no idea where the village was. They were not even sure where they were. The village was supposed to be close before they got lost, but now they couldn't find a trace of it. It seemed that Ryouga somehow got them significantly farther than it should've been possible. They weren't even in a forest anymore; it looked like a flipping desert.</p><p>On the bright side, there was an unspoken upside for them both in not having Shampoo around...</p><p>It was unfortunate that Ryouga restored his hair back to normal, though; it would have made excellent material to annoy him. Ranma had no choice but to go back to the standard insults.</p><p>"(Damn, pretty face. How in the world did you get us here?)" Ranma looked around in awe.</p><p>"(Shut up, Saotome!)" Ryouga replied angrily. He still wasn't happy about Ranma's prior stunt. "(Just be glad that I didn't just leave you there!)"</p><p>"(I think I would have liked it better if you <i>did</i> leave me there!)" Ranma retorted. "(I mean, look at this place!)" He waved his arms around. "(What the hell, man?)"</p><p>Ryouga scowled. "(If you have the energy to complain, then walk and shut up!)"</p><p>Ranma started to get annoyed at Ryouga's reasoning. Ryouga didn't even seem to care what Ranma thought; he kept walking without regard to him. Of course, Ranma had better stick close, unless he got stuck here by himself. They had better get out of here before that really happened.</p><p>Ranma walked over behind Ryouga, grabbing a canteen hanging from Ryouga's pack.  Ryouga was quick to notice this, and faced him with an annoyed look on his face.</p><p>"(I have an idea, Ryouga,)" he said, opening the canteen. "(I'll fly around and see if there's a town or anything nearby. You stay put right here until I get back.)"</p><p>"(Like hell you will, Saotome!)" Ryouga clamoured. "(That's the last bit of water we have! The nearest place with clean water could be days away!)"</p><p>"(Oh, don't be such a baby. I'll just use a few drops; no biggie.)" Ranma raised the canteen, but quickly got grabbed and lowered by Ryouga.</p><p>"(I said no!)" Ryouga pulled the canteen, but Ranma refused to let it go and pulled back.</p><p>"(It's only a few small friggin' drops, Ryouga!)" Ranma started shouting, his irritation getting the best of him.</p><p>"(No! Even a tiny drop matters!)" Ryouga shouted back.</p><p>"(Dammit, princess! Give me water!)" Ranma pulled furiously.</p><p>"(Like hell!)" Ryouga pulled back.</p><p>The two martial artists continued to wrestle over the canteen. A minute passed with no obvious victor, leaving Ranma to contemplate a plan. Ryouga wouldn't be defeated using brute force alone. Ranma would probably lose if this kept going.</p><p>Pulling it forcefully, Ranma utilised the momentum to push himself ahead towards his opponent. Taken aback, Ryouga took a few steps backwards in accordance to regain his balance. Ranma wouldn't let him do that, though. He planted a foot right behind Ryouga's, tripping him over. However, Ranma found that Ryouga's grip wasn't to be taken lightly, as he was pulled down with the larger boy. Unfortunately, the canteen got shoved onto Ryouga's face.</p><p>"(Argh!)" Ryouga drowned as the canteen's contents blurred her vision, triggering her curse in the process. The water was quick to stop coming out as there wasn't much in there to begin with. Ryouga lay there for a moment looking mildly annoyed.</p><p>Ranma was staring. He remained on top of her, unmoving. Ranma had blundered once again and now was in uncomfortable position. Her face was hairs away from his own. He could feel her warm breath on his face; her moving chest brushing against his, and her dark orbs staring into his.</p><p>"(Saotome. Get off,)" she suddenly said, bringing Ranma back to his senses.</p><p>As Ranma moved away, he felt his fingers tangle into her torn shirt, accidentally pulling it along with him.</p><p>"(Ah!") Ryouga yelped, pulling her shirt back. It tore even further and she ended</p><p>up missing her left sleeve. Ryouga desperately tried to cover herself up with the remains with limited success. "(You idiot!)" she yelled, her face red from embarrassment. "(Look what you did!)"</p><p>Ranma averted his eyes haphazardly, in an attempt to not stare. Despite what Ryouga had said about looking at his blunder, he had a feeling that she really didn't really mean that. Nevertheless, Ranma couldn't help but look at Ryouga. He was surprised to see that she didn't look angry anymore; she was more like...depressed.</p><p>Ryouga cast her eyes downwards away from Ranma. She could almost feel his gaze on her. "(Dammit, Saotome...)" she stuttered. Gritting her teeth, Ryouga continued. "(Why? Why do you keep pulling this crap on me?)" Ryouga looked at him in the eye. "(What did I ever do to you?)"</p><p>Ranma didn't know how to react. Ryouga looked genuinely upset. Whilst she was always upset at him for some reason, this felt entirely different. She really looked distressed. "(I... It was an accident! I didn't mean it.)" Ranma defended himself.</p><p>"(Why did you do <i>this</i>?)" Ryouga asked again.</p><p>"(I said it was an accident!)" Ranma stressed.</p><p>"(Heh. Accident...)" Ryouga looked away. "(Do you hate me that much, Saotome?)"</p><p>"(What?)" Ranma looked confused. She asked him if he hated her? If anything, it should have been the other way around, but that seemed like a moot point at the moment. "(I don't hate you, Ryouga.)" It was the truth. Ranma might have been annoyed or angry at Ryouga's stunts, but he didn't really hate the guy despite all that. Ranma wasn't really the type to hold those kind of serious grudges all over silly things.</p><p>Ryouga gave him a humourless chuckle. "(Really, Saotome? Back in Japan you ignored me, and when I find you here, you treat me like shit. You expect me to believe that?)"</p><p>What Ryouga just said made Ranma remember an important piece of detail. Before coming to China, Ranma had an agreement with Ryouga to meet up; though, Ryouga was late. Did he actually make it? His old man didn't leave him a choice; he was forced to take the trip to China when he wanted to wait even further.</p><p>"(I...)"</p><p>"(Why do you think I came all the way to China, Saotome?)" Ryouga looked at him. "(How do you think I feel?)"</p><p>Ranma didn't understand the question. Why <i>did</i> Ryouga come to China? Was it for him? Did she really care that much about him?</p><p>"(Am I just a joke to you? How do you feel about me, Saotome?)"</p><p>That was the decisive question. Ranma didn't know how to respond. "(I... I'm...)"</p><p>"(Answer me! How do you <i>feel</i> about <i>me</i>?)" she shot at him again.</p><p>Ranma cleared his throat to answer. He had no idea how he would say it. The moment she asked him that question, he could feel the answer within himself. It wasn't that he couldn't form the answer; he lacked the courage to admit it to himself, to say it to her. This was his last chance; if he ignored it now, there would never be another.</p><p>Ranma looked at her gazing at him through her reddening eyes, clutching the leftovers of her shirt and awaiting his answer. He opened his mouth to give it to her, but shut it again before uttering the first word. Ranma mentally cursed himself, and tried again. "(Ryouga, the truth is... Well, I was at first indifferent about you, I suppose. But later you kinda grew on me.)" Ranma observed her carefully. She was listening to him intently; good. "(I don't hate you, Ryouga. In fact, you just made me realise something. Despite the way I was acting, all this time I was in truth—)" Ranma cut himself short. "(All this time, my feelings for you actually grew, and I can safely say that I...)" He was going to say it! Ranma looked genuinely relieved as he spoke. The decisive word was at hand! He would say it! "(...really l-)"</p><p>But then ninjas! Thousands of them! They just came out of nowhere!</p><p>"(What the hell is going on?)" Ranma looked around him, astonished. They were surrounded by ninjas from all directions. A most haphazard thing has happened. It was almost as if God himself didn't want Ranma to say it. "(Where the hell did these guys come from?)"</p><p>Ranma heard Ryouga shriek behind him. He found her getting dragged by a horde of twenty or so ninjas.</p><p>"(Let go of me, you creeps!)" Ryouga yelled. She struggled within their clutches, but for every ninja she threw, five more showed up. They were relentless. Desperate, she reached out her hand towards Ranma. "(Help!)"</p><p>"(Damn ninjas! Let her go!)" Ranma demanded. He jostled at them with full force. Ranma beat a dozen of them out of his way before eleven ninjas decided to lunge at him from all directions. Ranma was quick to react and jumped into the air, where ten other ninjas lunged to greet him. Ranma was about to teach them the hard way not to challenge the Saotome school in aerial combat. Kicking a ninja in the face, he grappled another to swing him around like a rag doll and slapping the ninjas around him away.</p><p>As Ranma descended to the ground, he kicked a ninja on the head and out of his landing spot. Just then, a ninja successfully grappled him from behind, but Ranma quickly backhanded him on the face and threw him off onto another ninja in front of him all within two seconds.</p><p>However, those two seconds were more than enough time for two more ninjas to grapple him from his sides. Before Ranma could get rid of them, five more ninjas seized him, followed by tens more.</p><p>"(Argh!)" Ranma yelled in frustration. "(Hands off, scumbags! Ya all have a nasty breath!)"</p><p>The ninjas stopped moving for a second to look at each other, and sniffing sounds were heard, but they quickly resumed hindering him.</p><p>Ranma glanced at where Ryouga was, finding her way farther than she should be. They moved pretty damned quickly.</p><p>"(Ranma!)" Ryouga cried as they forcibly dragged her away, still holding out her hand. "(Help me!)"</p><p>"(Damned ninjas! Let go!)" Ranma struggled around his captors to no avail. "(Ryouga!)" Ranma reached out to her, yelling her name. He only saw her get further away from his hand. "(Noooooooooooooooooo-)"</p><p>"(Shut up!)" A harsh punch to the face interrupted his shout.</p><p>Ranma fell down harshly on a wooden floor, groaning in pain. He opened his eyes to see that his vision was blurry. He blinked rapidly and eventually found himself looking at an unknown ceiling. He tried to get up, but something was hindering him. He looked ahead and found out that he had been sitting on a chair an fell. Weird.</p><p>"Would you stop <i>yelling</i>?"</p><p>Ranma looked back up to see Ryouga's angry face looking down at him. "Huh?" Ranma was confused; what was going on? And why did his head hurt? Wanting answers, Ranma groggily whirled himself off the fallen chair and got back on his feet. Looking around, it looked like he was in a small restaurant of some sort, and everybody was staring at his direction. Ranma didn't have much time to think about it; his head was starting to spin. He quickly got the chair back up and sat down.</p><p>"What happened?" Ranma asked, rubbing his forehead in irritation. Sitting across of him was Ryouga, with Shampoo right next to him. Ryouga looked unhappy like usual, and Shampoo seemed indifferent.</p><p>"You fell off a cliff. That's what happened," Ryouga answered.</p><p>"A cliff?" Ranma recalled the event for a moment. "Oh, yeah. I fell and hit my head." That would explain Ranma's headache. That would also mean that the following events had all been a dream, which seemed reasonable. 'Jeez. Another crazy dream.' Ranma frowned at this. The scary thing was that this one was kind of realistic. Well, except for the ninjas.</p><p>Ranma absent-mindedly remembered the little chat he had with dream Ryouga. "Ugh." Feeling sick, he hid his face behind his palm. Ranma didn't believe he was going to say that. That made him feel worse than what he got from the previous dream. The dream was too real and disturbing. He just hoped that that was the last he'd see of any more crazy dreams, because his brain's closet would run out of room soon. "Where are we?" he asked, still hiding his face.</p><p>"We're at the village," Ryouga explained. "You wouldn't wake up, so I had to carry you all the way here, idiot. I swear, Saotome, if you do something like that o<i>ne more time</i>..."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah..." Ranma didn't pay much attention to the last bit. He finally uncovered his face to look at his rival. "So why does my face hurt?"</p><p>"I just punched you." Ryouga looked at him scornfully. "Don't just scream like that all of a sudden."</p><p>"No." Ranma frowned. "You punched me here." He pointed at his left cheek, and switched to the right one. "It hurts here."</p><p>"Oh." Ryouga seemed to realise what Ranma had meant. "Well, I tried to wake you up earlier..."</p><p>Ranma didn't like that answer very much. He blinked when he noticed something unusual. Ryouga had tilted his head a little bit, and a long ponytail attached to his head swung a little. "Whoa! Dude, what's with the hair?"</p><p>Ryouga looked at him in surprise for a second, but it quickly turned into rage. "What's with the hair?" He slapped the table in fury, earning the attention of the attendants once more. "Whose fucking fault do you think <i>this</i> is?" He grabbed the tied hair to show him.</p><p>"Wow. That's long," Ranma commented in surprise. The hair went past his shoulders and continued midway along his back. That would explain why there were no bangs going down Ryouga's face; he tied his hair. He wondered why he didn't notice that earlier. "If you hate it so much, why not just cut it?"</p><p>"You think I didn't try?" Ryouga yelled. Ranma's nonchalant behaviour was pissing him off! "I can't! Every time I cut it it grows back to the same length! I'm supposed to 'wait' until it wears off!"</p><p>"Oh." Ranma figured that probably meant the same for him as well. He'd only be able to take off the Dragon's Whisker once the effects wore off.</p><p>"Is that all you have to say? This is all your fault, Saotome!" Ryouga glowered.</p><p>"Now! Now!" Shampoo tried to calm him down. With some effort, she successfully managed to get Ryouga back down on his seat. "Let us all just sit down and enjoy supper, all right?" she persuaded sweetly.</p><p>"Hmph."</p><p>Supper? Ranma looked down at the table to find a delicious-looking roasted duck. How that escaped his notice, he had no idea. Ranma dragged the plate closer and licked his lips in anticipation of the taste.</p><p>"Would you lot shut up? I'm trying to eat in peace!"</p><p>The group of three glanced at the stranger. He was a youth clad in a cloak, looking to be around their age; he was perhaps older by a bit, but not by much. He walked over to them with an unpleasant look on his face.</p><p>Before Ryouga could sheepishly apologise for the ruckus, Ranma decided to speak.</p><p>"Bugger off, dude. I'm eating!" Ranma stuck a duck's leg into his own mouth. It was tastier than it looked!</p><p>The stranger didn't look too happy. "You've got some fucking nerve. Say that again," he dared.</p><p>Ryouga brushed his palm over his face. Ranma was about to use his magic, which always ensued disastrous results.</p><p>Shampoo sighed inwardly, having a good idea of the outcome.</p><p>"Ya think I'm scared of you?" Ranma chewed on the duck's meat, looking the stranger over. Something unusual about him caught his attention; if Ranma didn't know any better, he'd say that the stranger tied tights around his waist... He was probably mistaken. "I'm the heir of the Saotome Musabetsu Kakutou-ryuu, the great Saotome Ranma," he proclaimed with a pointed thumb, mouth full of food.</p><p>"What did you say just now?" The stranger promptly held Ranma by the collar. "Repeat that!"</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma asked nonchalantly, biting more off the duck. "I'm the great Saotome Ranma?"</p><p>"No, you idiot! Before that!"</p><p>Ranma frowned a bit at that. "Musabetsu Kakutou...?"</p><p>The stranger just as promptly shoved Ranma back into his chair. Leaning his hand on the table, the stranger lowered himself to Ranma's eye level. He slowly said, "Musabetsu Kakutou... Where is your master?"</p><p>"My master?" Ranma resumed eating. "You mean my pop? Hell if I know."</p><p>"That dirty old fart is your old man? Where is he?" the stranger demanded, holding Ranma by the collar again.</p><p>"That's kinda harsh," Ranma commented. "Pop may be a fat lazy pig, but he's no old goat."</p><p>Ranma's irrelevant comments only further irritated the angry stranger. "Give me a fucking answer, dammit! Where is Happosai?"</p><p>"Happo-who?" Ranma asked in confusion. That name <i>did</i> sound kind of familiar to him, though. Ranma just couldn't recall where he heard it before. "My pop is Saotome Genma, not some Happo-whatever."</p><p>Looking disappointed, the stranger finally let Ranma go. "Your old man might know where he is, then," the stranger concluded. "Take me to him."</p><p>Ranma almost groaned. "Look, chap. I said I ain't got no clue where he is. I haven't seen him in months. Give it a rest already." Believing his point finally sunk in, Ranma turned his attention back to his food.</p><p>"In that case, I'll make you take me to him." The stranger followed up with a punch aimed at the back of Ranma's head.</p><p>Ranma's senses kicked in; he picked up the plate and narrowly avoided getting hit. The table wasn't so lucky and got shattered into splinters.</p><p>Ryouga and Shampoo reacted quickly to the stranger's movements. They promptly held their plates and drinks.</p><p>Ryouga was about to yell something, but decided against it. He would rather have Ranma deal with his own problems by himself. It didn't look like something Ryouga would enjoy getting dragged into.</p><p>Shampoo didn't really care much and watched the commotion with mild interest.</p><p>"Hey, what's the big idea?" Ranma carefully distanced himself from the stranger.</p><p>"I don't take no for an answer," the stranger simply replied, resuming his assault with another punch.</p><p>Ranma saw it coming, ducking under it and leaping away onto another table.</p><p>The battle was briefly interrupted as a chef suddenly burst out of the back room."Hey! No fighting in my restaurant!"</p><p>The stranger immediately threw a dagger towards the chef's direction.</p><p>"Eep!" The chef fell back just as the dagger passed right above his head.</p><p>Ranma looked annoyed, but still pulled the second leg off the duck. "Jeez. What does a guy need to do to eat in peace?" He munched on it.</p><p>The stranger had no intention of letting Ranma off so easily and charged at him. Ranma jumped off the table backwards as the stranger proceeded to destroy his second table. The stranger didn't waste time and quickly lunged at Ranma with a shower of punches and kicks.</p><p>Ranma avoided contact with each punch and kick with precision. Not in fear of pain, but in fear of losing his duck. 'Damn. This guy is actually pretty good,' Ranma thought. Each strike the stranger threw his way was progressively getting closer to hit its mark.</p><p>Eventually, Ranma found a punch heading straight to his face. There was no avoiding that one, so Ranma brought an arm up to block, and followed up with a sweep kick. The stranger jumped back, giving Ranma more than enough time to retreat. With a massive leap backwards, Ranma landed on relatively safe ground.</p><p>Ranma had better think of something. There was no way he'd keep fending him off whilst holding a roasted duck. With a plan in mind, Ranma promptly wolfed down the duck.</p><p>"(You seem to be getting better at least, Saotome.)"</p><p>Ranma looked under him to find himself standing on Ryouga's head. It was funny how he didn't notice that, or maybe he did but didn't think about it. After all, his duck was at stake. "(Oh, hey, Ryouga,)" Ranma said between bites. "(Can you believe this guy? He attacked me for no good reason. He might actually be worse than you.)"</p><p>"(Could you get off of my head now?)" Ryouga yelled.</p><p>"Play time's over, fuckface!" the stranger exclaimed.</p><p>The trio paid him their attention. The stranger smirked smugly at them as he held up what looked like a glass of water.</p><p>"What's that clown doing now?" Ryouga asked, the weight on his head forgotten.</p><p>Ranma shrugged and ate as he watched, while Shampoo simply sipped her juice.</p><p>The stranger splashed himself with the water, and subsequently, all hell broke loose.</p><p>The trio widened their eyes at the display before them. What was once a young man was now a... They didn't know how to describe it. A beast? A monster? A freak of nature?</p><p>"Ryouga," Ranma was the first to speak. "Pinch me."</p><p>Ryouga was happy to help with that, and raised a hand to pinch Ranma's butt.</p><p>"Ow!" Ranma knew now that he wasn't dreaming. He couldn't tell the difference lately. At any rate, Ranma examined the creature with his eyes once more to make sure that his eyes told him the truth.</p><p>The thing stood at least four metres tall, with the face of the stranger that appeared more...effeminate, the arms of a bear, the legs of a bull, and what looked like the torso of some sort of humanoid bird; as it was covered in golden feathers. It had massive golden wings on its back, and also a countless amount of tentacles from its back.</p><p>The stranger laughed in a higher pitched voice as he took a step forward, forcefully shaking the establishment.</p><p>"Dude!" Ranma exclaimed in shock. "Is that some kind of Jusenkyo curse? What the hell is that?"</p><p>The stranger sniggered at the three, and decided to humour him. "This? I believe it was called..." he paused for a moment to recall the exact wording. "Spring of Drowned Tentacle Monster Getting Attacked by a Bear whilst Riding a Bull and Raping a Harpy." It sounded ridiculous, even to him; but it was an old tragedy and all of that didn't matter to him. The stranger decided to end the chitchat and get on with it. He took another step forward and prepared to attack.</p><p>Still atop Ryouga's head, Ranma nervously presented whatever left of his dish. "Duck?"</p><p>"Bon appétite!" the stranger yelled, sending hundreds of tentacles towards the trio.</p><p style="text-align:center;">To be continued...</p><p>Authors' Notes:</p><p><b>Dark Master Schmidt:</b> I !</p><p>Yeah, so it's been, what? Nearly three years since my last update? Wow. You guys must have thought I was dead or something. But here I am; alive and, um, well, writing again.</p><p>It's funny how some joked about me updating in 2007, a year after the previous chapter. I've actually only started writing this chapter on October 2007. Of course, I stopped multiple times. It wasn't until I got some motivation and constant pestering recently that I've finished this chapter. Hopefully, this doesn't happen again.</p><p>The content I originally planned for this chapter would have probably made it twice as long. Seeing how long it has become, I've decided to put whatever else I planned for later. Is that groaning I hear? I suppose I can't blame anyone seeing how long 'later' can actually be, especially when I'm involved.</p><p>Next up, Ranma and Herb cross paths again! Here's to hoping for a prompt future update!</p><p>Well, fuck. I have other stories to take care of now.</p><p>- 20/04/2009</p><p><b>Nuvares:</b> HE !</p><p>Hey everyone, it's been a good while since you've last heard from me. All I can say is sorry and offer an extremely busy life as an excuse. On the plus side Schmidt has poked me enough to get started writing some again and I'm currently working on my first chapter since 2006.</p><p>Here's to hoping I get it done. And to all of those who want to ping me at yahoo and tell me to get working. It'll help me get done.</p><p>- 21/04/2009</p>
