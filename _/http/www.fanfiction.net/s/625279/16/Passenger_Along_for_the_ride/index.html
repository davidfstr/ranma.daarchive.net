</div>Souun was staring at Ranma. Nabiki was staring at Ranma. Akane...<p>You get the picture.<p>Under the combined stares of the remaining Tendou clan, Ranma was getting very nervous. After telling them the facts (pit, cats, fish sausages, dried sardines, salted sardines, fish cakes, cat food, dead mice, dead birds, cheese sticks, steaks, fillet of sole, haddock, cod, salmon, bacon, eggs (don't ask), dead rats, chicken sausage, lard balls, potato chips (AN: MY cat likes them, anyway... keeps stealing them.), ferrets, guinea pigs, live pigeons, that one time with all the balls of yarn, and, of course, he'd never forget the last one. The TUNA one.), he'd expected some sort of response. Although, actually, he was getting one. He was pretty sure Souun hadn't been that particular shade of green when he started, and Kasumi's skin was usually a nice light tone, not pure white... Okay, so that WAS a reaction of sorts.<p>He just wished they'd SAY something.<p>*Ranma?*<p>*Yes, Kodora?*<p>*Why didn't you mention how many times, exactly, it WAS, when you told me about this?*<p>*Ahh... it slipped my mind?*<p>Kodora decided that, given Ranma, she'd believe that one. *Okay. May I kill Oyagi?*<p>Ranma sweatdropped.<p>*Ah... maybe later...*<p>Ranma paled at the response THAT got, and wondered when Kodora had managed to hang around sailors without his noticing.<p>Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â« Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«<p>Passenger<p>Chapter 14: Furinkan High Jinx<p>A Ranma 1/2 fanfiction by S. Starblade<p>Dedicated to those who listen to others, and bear sympathy.<p>Warning: I borrow things from people, but I promise I'll give them back. Really. I'll even fill up the tank, and wash and wax it for ya, too! Please? OOOOOOOOHHHHH, THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU! (Pulls Onna-Ranma Cute Face #3: Cuter than two billion bunnies)<p>Disclaimer: Enough jokes here... everyone does that. Most of the characters aren't mine, they belong to Takahashi-sama.

Really, that food had been sitting out in the boxes. If the fruit-stand man hadn't intended for it to be taken, why was it just sitting out there? Besides, he'd thought the man would be afraid of his panda form. He certainly hadn't expected a bunch of ninjas to accost him. Especially as they seemed to be using some wierd martial arts...<p>"Seiika-ken Special Attack: Salad Shooter!"<p>Genma-panda winced as he was struck in the back by a few of the slices of apple and peach. Who'd have expected food to ever be so SHARP?<p>Those Ginsu knives didn't look promising, either...<p>******<p>Kodora got up out of bed, grateful not to have to deal with the casts anymore, and that the fur and claws didn't reappear when they returned her to the fore. What a relief. Sunday had been fun, all lying around and doing nothing, even if Ranma had had the whole day. They always switched over to her before going to sleep though. This was partly because she needed to learn to wake at the least sign of danger, and partly because she got up before him, and if that happened while HE was up front and asleep, she'd be stuck unable to do anything, but feeling everything he felt.<p>Three times rolling over a sharp rock in his sleep had convinced her to talk to him IMMEDIATELY.<p>Following Ranma's suggestion to make everything into training of some sort, and her own willingness to move in interesting and difficult ways, she silently cartwheeled to the door, opened it with her foot while standing on her hands, and finished the last cartwheel to end up standing in the hallway. She slumped down into a somersault, managing to stop in a sitting position on the top step. Standing, she went down the stairs three at a time, landing carefully on each step with one foot.<p>Ranma, of course, could have done all this (excepting open the door with his foot) about twice as fast with weights tied to him and Genma attacking him the whole time, but then, he'd had a lot more training.<p>Oh well. She'd just have to keep improving every day.<p>She was very interested by the way things worked here. She was totally aware that wherever she was, was some manga or anime or other.<p>That meant the formerly impossible was possible.<p>And she and Ranma were (well, nominally she) martial artists.<p>The people in Street Fighter were martial artists. Chun Li and E. Honda for instance.<p>And she herself was pretty fast. She certainly couldn't do Chun Li's Hyakuretsu-Kyaku as it was, but if she could find some way to train...<p>As she finished gathering the bath articles, she wondered if she was the first one to think of using a technique to allow human limbs to surpass all normal speeds.<p>******<p>Somewhere on a boat between Japan and China, a group of three Amazons, one of whom resembled nothing so much as a living prune, sneezed in unison.<p>The tallest one, a slender, whipcord woman with green hair in a long braid, reading a book, and wearing a blue-gray pantsuit spoke up in a soft, low, soothing voice.<p>{Someone speaks of us.}<p>Kho Lon, perched atop her staff, snorted derisively. {I can't believe one so well versed in magic believes that old myth.}<p>The green-haired lady turned her head to look at Kho Lon.<p>{Behind myth, is always substantiation of some sort. It may not be exactly right, but it is like rumour. It has roots somewhere.}<p>Xian Pu, trying to make wards on a rocking boat, was frustrated both by her failure to succeed and the way the other two acted.<p>{Spiritualist Sin Ku, please remind me why neither you nor great- grandmother can help me with these?}<p>Sin Ku, with obvious patience, and a calmness that stated she was not the least bothered by the question, despite this being the hundredth (literally) time it had been asked, responded quietly.<p>{Because, Xian Pu, you are the one who will be using them. They will be stronger for you than for anyone else. And should you fail your test, your great-grandmother and I have our own to use.}<p>Sighing, Xian Pu returned to her labor. She still didn't see why she had to do this before sunrise only, though.<p>******<p>The Tendou breakfast table was largely quiet, with Souun wishing Ranma a better first day this time around being the most discussed thing that morning.<p>Meaning four lines had been said about it, largely to the effect of 'Good luck.' 'You'll need it, Ranma.' 'I know.' and finally 'Thanks, Mr. Tendou.'<p>Ranma got up to go, as soon as Nabiki did. She raised an eyebrow.<p>Ranma had the good grace to look embarrassed. "I forgot how to get there."<p>Nabiki frowned. "One hundred yen."<p>*Don't bother Ranma, we can follow her from a distance.*<p>*Good point.*<p>"No thanks."<p>Nabiki's external frown disappeared, while her internal one deepened. That hadn't gone how she expected. Every time she thought she had Ranma pinned down, he would surprise her again.<p>******<p>Kodora spluttered, adjusting the kung-fu pants and the sky-blue tang. "Chikushou."<p>The ladle lady either didn't see her, or was used to Nerima, at this point noone could have told anymore.<p>Done fixing her clothes, the tiny demon-girl looked around.<p>*Kodora? Wasn't Touhuu-san's place around here somewhere?*<p>*Good idea. He can probably give us directions to school... I lost track of Nabiki.*<p>******<p>Touhuu handed over the warm kettle.<p>"Here you go, Kodora-chan. Could I talk to you a bit before you bring Ranma back, first?"<p>Kodora nodded, setting the kettle aside.<p>Could we speak in English, though, Touhuu-sensei? I could use the practice.<p>Touhuu nodded. Okay, no problem. Anyways, I wanted to talk to you about your body. How old are you?<p>Kodora grinned. Chronologically, actually, or mentally?<p>The doctor eyed her.<p>She dropped the grin. Okay, okay, I'll be serious. I was eighteen and a half when this happened. So, I'm maybe three, four months off from nineteen. Why?<p>Touhuu nodded. Your body is about twelve. A very... ahem developed twelve, but, still twelve.<p>Kodora frowned, not sure whether to be happy or not. So, I'm going to grow some?<p>The doctor nodded again. Unless the curse locks your age, which would make you twelve forever.<p>This time, the small girl paled. But... I WANT to age...<p>Touhuu smiled. Don't worry too much. According to the Guide, most curses don't, remember?<p>O-okay. I'd wondered why I hadn't started.. She blushed slightly, and paused, before continuing. ..menstruating yet. Kodora coughed into her hand, somewhat embarrassed.<p>Anyways, Kodora, you also have to remember that this means your body will likely change some as time goes by, so you'll need to adjust to growing again.<p>The small girl nodded. Was that all?<p>Touhuu smiled. Yes, it was. Now go ahead to school.<p>A cheery smile in return, Kodora poured the water, and Ranma, looking a bit shakey, wobbled out of the clinic.<p>"I wonder what..." Touhuu paused. "Oh, right. Duh. Menstruating. Heh. Ranma sure looked shocked."<p>******<p>After a short detour to the clinic, Ranma arrived at school. The clock read 7:62.<p>Ranma blinked, then shrugged. School didn't start until 8:30, so... they were early anyway. Exactly how early really didn't matter.<p>Especially since he'd still failed to beat Tatewaki to the school.<p>Ranma warily shifted his weight as the pompous kendoist strode towards him, bokken in one hand, bento in the other.<p>"Saotome Ranma, I, the Koushokou Nichirin (Yellow Sun) of Furinkan High, Tatewaki Kuno, would speak with you!"<p>Ranma blinked. Kuno was calling himself WHAT?<p>"And why have you nicknamed yerself the Kousho Kuni Kirin (Trifling Country Giraffe)? Are ya sayin' yer an unimportant bumpkin from th' boonies?"<p>Furinkan's favourite fool was flabbergasted.<p>"Saotome, do you perhaps have cotton in your ears?"<p>Ranma eyed Kuno warily. "No... why?"<p>The schizo samurai eyed Ranma similarly. "This is the second time you've misheard me."<p>Ranma looked confused.<p>*Kodora?*<p>*Hahahahahaha...*<p>*Kodora, did I mishear him?*<p>*Mmph, heheh, yep! Ha ha...wheee...*<p>"Ano..." Ranma began. "Er... uh, gomen, uh ne, err... Kuno-sempai..."<p>******<p>Toltiir, who was watching invisibly from a celestial lounging chair, having decided to drop by, fell out of it. A Ranma Saotome had apologized. This explained what Satan and Yahweh were doing over there, chatting it up over a couple beers. Satan must have been blizzarded out. The cat grinned. With just a little tweak THERE, he could cause all sorts of... wait. Try that again. Little tweak THERE...<p>Toltiir frowned as nothing happened. Then he heard Kamisama speaking behind him.<p>I AM SORRY, TOLTIIR. BUT THE WISH SPECIFIED NO INTERFERENCE BEYOND WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE WISH.<p>"Chikushou." Stated Toltiir. "Oh, well. Should be fun to watch, anyways."<p>******<p>*Ranma, I'm proud of you. You actually apologised!*<p>Ranma, following Kuno to the gym, looked around nervously.<p>*I'm still expectin' Oyaji to show up outta nowhere and attack me for this...*<p>Kodora mentally grumbled something Ranma was sure he really didn't want to hear anyways.<p>They arrived in the Gym, where Kuno took up a position next to a spindly little baggy-eyed guy with candles stuck in his headband. Both had several shinto wards and a variety of good-luck charms.<p>"It seems," began the Kendo captain, "That I may have been mistaken in my original estimation of your existence, Saotome. Therefore, I would like to run a test, with the aid of this... thing..." Here, he gestured to Gosunkugi, who waved timidly. "To determine your true nature. Oh, and I would appreciate it if you took your true form for this. Otherwise it may not work."<p>Ranma frowned. "Whadda you mean 'true form'?"<p>Kuno responded simply "Your true form. Just that. With the tail and red eyes and all."<p>Ranma frowned more.<p>*Ranma, humor him. He obviously couldn't know you're just as real as I am.  Although why he chose to believe me the original...*<p>The frown disappeared.<p>*If you say so, Kodora.*<p>"Okay, Kuno. But, ya gotta get me some cold water."<p>It was Kuno's turn to frown.<p>Gos wondered if it was contagious.<p>"For what reason, Saotome?"<p>Ranma shrugged. "'s how I change, why else?"<p>Kuno nodded. "Very well. Underclassman Gosunkugi, fetch a glass of water."<p>While Gos was gone, Ranma and Kuno stood there, exchanging bored stares with each other.<p>Eventually Kuno got impatient. "What under the heavens has delayed that half-wit?"<p>At which point, Gos, running into the room, tripped, and the water few out all over Ranma.<p>Kodora, prepared for this, immediately reached back with her hair-ribbon, and tied it in an expert bow around her quills, while removing the "string" that Ranma had been using.<p>Gos's eyes bugged out: he, along with most of the school, hadn't yet seen the transformation. It was rather eerie. It wasn't like a shift or a change in form, really. Just, one moment, Ranma was there, the next, this... demon-thing was, in the exact same clothes. There didn't even seem to be any discontinuity or motion, despite the different positions the clothes took depending on whom was wearing them.<p>Kuno nodded. "Thank you, underclassman." Then he took up one of the shinto wards.<p>Kodora eyed the ward. "What's that for, Kuno-sempai?"<p>Kuno strode towards her. "This will prove whether or not you are a demon. If not, this won't hurt."<p>Kodora nodded, and allowed Kuno to stick the scroll to her forehead. She froze, as a very strange sensation began there.<p>Kuno and Gosunkugi stared at her.<p>Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â« Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«Â«<p>Uh-oh. Now what?<p>Well, you'll just have to wait for later. MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! You can only find out by reading! WAHAHAHAHAHAHA! YOU WILL NEVER FIGURE IT OUT! AAAAA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!<p>::mallets nega-Starblade into oblivion:: Er... sorry about that. You will have to wait, though.<p>Sorry I'm slowing down on turning out the chapters of this, but I'm starting to get to where I've started too many subplots here, and can't quite decide which ones to resolve when.<p>Oh, that's right, one other thing...<p>Any reviewers, what do you think of the possibility of Kodora learning martial arts? This question is deliberately vague: I want answers more than yes or no. I need general whys and whats. No technique suggestions, though, I've got more than enough imagination.<p>And I'm sorry this is one of the shortest chapters. Oh, well.<p>Ja ne!
