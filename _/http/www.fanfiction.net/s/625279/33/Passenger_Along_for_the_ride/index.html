</div>Okey - dokey... Alla you out there who read my stuff!<p>It's time for something interesting! This fourth interlude is NOT meant to be of one piece with the other three! This is its own interlude. That was, of course the original idea: somewhere in every book is a little chapter that holds only other stuff, extras. Dissertation kinda got outta hand, but don't worry, I'll finish it eventually.<p>As for this- this interlude will include a few nifty extras.<p>PART ONE<p>It has come to my attention that a lot of people are under the impression that Kodora, Ranma, and Ryoga are considerably more powerful in one aspect or another than they are intended to come across as. To rectify this, I have here a set of measurements (no, not that kind you hentai!). These are by no means absolute nor perfectly accurate. In fact, they are set in somewhat loose terms, although they are terms that most Ranma readers will understand.<p>Each character will be rated in terms of nine statistics.<p>Strength- raw strength. Basically, how much can they lift? How hard do they hit? Agility- agility. How fast are their reflexes? How skilled are they at dodging? How good is their balance? Speed- whole-body. How fast do they run/walk/hop/fly/cartwheel/slither/roll/etc.? How fast can they strike? Flexibility- How much contortion can they do? How far can they bend their joints in ways that shouldn't be possible? Toughness- How can they handle taking blows? How hard are they to injure? Endurance- How long can they exert themselves before they're tired? How often do they need to rest? Skill- How much control over what they can do can they exert? How many techniques do they know? Chi- How much chi do they produce? Also notes which emotion(s) are best for fueling chi attacks. Ingenuity- How good are they at coming up with tactics and solutions on the fly? How fast are they, mentally?<p>Okay? Ratings are like this.<p>STR<p>1: Normal human, lift perhaps a mid-sized TV<p>2: Akane, pick up large wooden tables, break many bricks in one blow<p>3: Pick up and carry around Genma-panda, break concrete<p>4: Throw large chunks of ice, like during the Martial Arts Skating battle<p>5: That trick Ryoga does with his umbrella where he throws the huge boar way up into the air<p>6: Hey, is that a truck you're carrying around?<p>AGI<p>1: Normal human, catch thrown ball<p>2: Won't get hit in a normal game of dodgeball<p>3: Dodge Kuno's 'thousand strikes' technique<p>4: Dodge speeding arrow<p>5: Dodge speeding bullet<p>6: Dodge machinegun fire<p>SPD<p>1: Normal human, maybe 12 MPH tops<p>2: Experienced runner, 14-16 MPH<p>3: Ranma at beginning of series in a hurry, 18-20 MPH<p>4: Outrun speeding golf carts<p>5: Outrun Shampoo's Bicycle of Doom<p>6: Run the Indy 500<p>FLEX<p>1: Normal human, can't scratch that one spot on your back<p>2: Flexible, can put foot on top of own head<p>3: Contortionist, can do splits sideways so far knees hit armpits<p>4: Expert contortionist, can bend better than Dhalsim<p>5: Boneless, Since when can you fit in a suitcase?<p>6: Shouldn't that break your neck?<p>TOUGH<p>1: Normal human<p>2: Can ignore thrown tennis balls completely<p>3: Can ignore thrown rocks completely<p>4: Bakusai Tenketsu. Need I say more?<p>5: Can ignore falling boulders<p>6: Rockslide? What rockslide?<p>ENDUR<p>1: Normal human<p>2: Let's run the seven-minute mile again!<p>3: Oooo, look! That marathon starts when this one ends! Sign me up!<p>4: So I haven't sat down all week. So what?<p>5: You've been running for HOW many days continuously?<p>6: Why are you looking so tired? It's only 120 flights of stairs. We've only run it three times!<p>SKILL<p>1: Normal human<p>2: Akane<p>3: Kuno on a really good day<p>4: Genma half-asleep<p>5: Happosai half-asleep<p>6: Ko Lon on full<p>CHI<p>1: Normal human<p>2: Ranma at beginning of series<p>3: Can use a chi-spending technique as a final attack<p>4: Can use a chi-blast as a final attack<p>5: Can throw chi-blasts like large rocks<p>6: Herb<p>INGEN<p>1: Normal<p>2: Comes up with own chi blast<p>3: You revised the Hiryuu Shoten Ha HOW many times?<p>4: Would you believe I just realized how to make a nuclear bomb with ordinary household items?<p>5: Fixes computers with stone tools<p>6: Hey, I just realized the meaning of life!<p>Okay, got that? Here goes.<p>As of this point in my Passenger fanfiction:<p>Name: STR AGI SPD FLEX TOUGH ENDUR SKILL CHI INGEN<p>Ranma 4 3.5 3 3 2 2.5 4 4 2.5<p>Kodora 1.5 2 3 2 1.5 2 2 4.5 3.5<p>Tatewaki Kuno 2 2 1.5 1 2 2 3 1.5 -1<p>Akane 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 1<p>Kodachi Kuno 1 2.5 2 2.5 1 1 3.5 1 1<p>Genma* 5 (4) 4.5 (4) 4.5 (3.5) 2 (1) 3 3 4.5 (4) 5 (2) 3.5 (.5)<p>Souun 4 3 3 2 2.5 1.5 4 4 1.5<p>Ryoga 5 2.5 2 2 2.5 4 4 4 1.5<p>Ko Lon 3 5 3 3 1 5 6 5 2<p>Xian Pu 4 4 2 2 2 3 3.9 3 1.5<p>Sin Ku ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?<p>Kasumi 1 2 ? ? ? 2.5 ? ? ?<p>Nabiki 1 1 1.5 1 1 1 1.5 ? 3.5<p>Noriko 1.1 2.5 1.5 3 1 1.5 3 1 ?<p>Extensive list, ne?<p>PART TWO<p>And now, it's time for... a GUESSING GAME!

"Candyland, kid. Candyland." "I meant to do that!"

This list includes standard techniques, techniques mentioned often in fanfiction despite their not being canon, and my techniques. The names are as they originally appeared. Japanese names have a LITERAL English translation in quotes. That means in the same order they appear in the name of the technique.<p>Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken "Broiled Sweed Chestnut Fist"- Canon. High speed hand motion. Includes great deal of control, hence the ability to remove chestnuts from a fire. Because of control, things like high-speed shiatsu are possible.<p>Seigensakudoken "Speed Limit Fist" - Mine. VERY high speed hand motion. Very little control, but easier than KTA and harder to defend against, since hits are pretty much at random. Faster than KTA from same fighter.<p>Ironcloth- Sort of canon, sort of not canon. Word used to describe ability to use cloth items (bandannas, belts, long sleeves) as though they were made of much stiffer, sturdier material. More of a chi-imbuing method than anything else. This ability is never described as a technique in Ranma 1/2, but it is generally assumed that the things Ryoga does with his bandannas and belt are part of this technique.<p>Bakusai Tenketsu "Blasting (Pressure/Vulnerable) Points- Canon. Two-part technique. The obvious part of the technique is that it gives the user the ability to strike a stone (or area of ground) with one finger, causing it to violently shatter, spraying pieces everywhere. Definitely does not work on humans. In canon, this is not explained, nor whether or not the Bakusai Tenketsu strike works on anything BUT rocks. The second part of the technique is gained from the method of training. The Bakusai Tenketsu toughens the student, making them impervious to damage from anything but major impacts. The method for this is also not explained- perhaps a use of chi to harden the part of the body being struck, possibly just natural toughening. There is much disagreement as to which way this part works.<p>Stonebreaker Fist- Popular. This technique is used for striking hard objects, rocks, armor, or particularly tough opponents, and causing unprecedented damage. It involves focusing chi into one's fist, and releasing the chi into the target on impact. This increased the force and damage potential of a blow greatly.<p>Hiryuu Shooten Ha "Flying Dragon Ascension Wave" (and variation Hiryuu Gyooten Ha "Flying Dragon Heaven Wave")- This technique is very unusual. First, one must have an opponent with a battle aura, works very well with auras inspired by the hot emotions (anger, lust, embarrassment, outrage). By focusing one's chi to draw kinetic energy OUT of the area around one's body, the user creates an equivalent cold aura. The user then draws their opponent into a spiral, causing a winding of cold and hot air spirals into one, much like the beginning of a natural hurricane. Then, once the center of the spiral is reached, the user forces the cold aura into contact with the hot aura (usually with a single blow, generally an uppercut). This causes the 'unwinding' of the spiral, which creates great amounts of wind, resulting in a sort of localized hurricane or controlled tornado. Highly skilled users can produce both hot and cold aura and wind them around each other so as to create the tornado without needing the spiral motion or even the opponent.<p>Juuno-Ken "Fist Of Ten"- Popular. This is generally assumed to be a basic special attack of the Tendoo school of the Musabetsu Kaketoo Ryu. It is very simple- the user simply performs a heavy chi-enhanced punch. Since action produces reaction, the user must stay still and brace themself for a moment to use this attack to full effect, limiting it's use.<p>Shishi Hokodan "Lion (Roaring/Halberd) (Bullet/Missile)"- Canon. A standard, depression-fueled chi-attack. Has the interesting property of forming a physically heavy ball of chi and air, which will fall if given the opportunity. Like any emotion-based attack, it gets bigger and stronger the more of the particular emotion the user is feeling.<p>Shishi Hokodan Perfect- Canon. This version takes advantage of the heaviness of the chi-ball created by the Shishi Hokodan. By launching the chi directly into the air, the user forces it to fall straight back down. The result of this is that rather than a ball of chi that plows into the opponent, the user effectively projects a well of temporarily increased pressure, a similar effect to suddenly putting their opponent in deep sea for a few short instants. Due to the nature of the Shishi Hokodan as an emotion-based chi blast, for the short time that the pressure in the area is increased by the chi, the user is emotionally 'empty', and hence they reabsorb the chi putting pressure on themself rather than suffering from it. This is why Ranma was able to distract Ryooga in the 18th manga, causing the lost boy to suffer the effects of the attack as well. Note that this attack requires no more depression than the standard Shishi Hokodan, just a different use for it.<p>Shishi Hokodan Superior- Mine. This attack can be performed only by someone who is at the utmost of depression, who feels (at least at the time) as though they have no worth at all. The fullness of the emotion causes an interesting effect. Rather than projecting the chi in a sphere and basically throwing it at the opponent, the attack creates a beam of chi. This beam acts somewhat like a laser, more or less punching through whatever gets in its way. The user builds up a large aura of depression- fueled chi, sucks it into the area of their body, and then effectively lets it out through a small 'hole' in the side of their aura. Why does the size of the hole matter? Try fooling with a hose, putting your thumb over the end of it. The less space the water flows from, the higher the pressure. Simple. With the sheer volume of depression, much more energy flows through the same space, causing a different kind of damage. A standard chi attack, in fact is more a bludgeoning attack, whereas the beam of the Shishi Hokodan Superior is more of a piercing effect.<p>Mooko Takabisha "Fierce Tiger Domineering"- Canon. This is Ranma's invented response to the Shishi Hokodan. Because it draws on self- confidence, a much 'lighter' emotion than depression, when released it has more of a tendency to either float away or bob around like a balloon with just enough helium. This means that any 'Perfect' attack would have to be performed with an entirely different method from the Shishi Hokodan Perfect. Also, being a 'lighter' emotion makes it less focusable, meaning that a 'Superior' technique would also have to be performed differently.<p>Kijin Raishuu Dan "Fierce God Attack (Bullet/Missile)"- Canon. This is a very strange chi technique. Rather than using the chi of the attack as the weapon, the user makes a sort of blade-structure of their chi, and pushes that through the air. The chi-structure warps, causing a thin sliver of vacuum to fly through the air. It is the vacuum that does the damage, rather than the chi. Because of the nature of the vacuum, it will cut through more or less anything until the chi sustaining the vacuum dies out.  Contrary to some beliefs, because of the way a vacuum will suck anything in, there is no way to change the attack to make it totally non-lethal, without removing the vacuum aspect. Additionally, since the chi is not the actual attack, this attack is harder to detect through chi-senses than most attacks.<p>Mooko Kaimon Ha "Tiger Open Gate Wave"- Canon. It is uncertain where the true power of this technique lies. After shouting 'Look Out!' to distract the opponent, the user thrusts their arms forward, flinging them wide. At the exact same time, the user swings one foot up in a swift kick. Perhaps the arms break an opponent's guard, letting the kick through. Perhaps the arms and the kick together are what do the damage, and the 'Look Out!' is supposed to cause the target to unfocus their chi. Whichever way it is, this attack is similarly dangerous to the Kijin Raishuu Dan, which is understandable considering that it belongs to the same school.<p>Umi-Sen-Ken "Sea-Thousand-Fist"- Canon. This is not actually the name of the technique. The true name of the method of undetected motion is apparently never actually given in either the manga or the anime. Either way, the ability to move completely undetected is extremely powerful and deserves mention. Through use of this technique, the user becomes invisible and hides their chi entirely. It is generally assumed that there are several small faults in the technique, however. For instance, the technique does nothing about odor, touch, or sound to all appearances. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the technique leaves an area of NO CHI AT ALL, meaning that someone of sharp mind with a chi sense actually CAN detect the user, if they know there is someone there to look for. Whether this is true or not is unknown.<p>Donki Hasami "Blunted Scissors"- Mine. This technique is a bit unusual. It is based entirely on raw skill, accuracy, and physical strength, and does not use any more chi than a standard punch or kick. The power of this attack is derived from the pincer motion of the two sticks/clubs/whatever the user implements. By swinging both clubs correctly, the clubs will form a shape like a scissors. The actual effects of the technique depend on the target. On something thin, especially if it is brittle, stiff, or hard, the simultaneous blows on either side of it will usually cause the target to break. On something larger or less breakable, the simultaneous blows merely enhance each other's effect. These effects are because the two blows striking at precisely the same time on almost perfectly-opposite sides of the target exert force towards each other as well as on the target, more than doubling the effect of either blow.<p>Reppa Donki Hasami Ha "Rapidfire Blunted Scissors Wave"- Mine. This is not exactly a true technique, not having a set pattern. It is literally what its name means. By focusing and possibly using chi to enhance their own speed, the user strikes repeatedly with the Donki Hasami. Something similar can be performed with nearly any attack, such as with Tatewaki Kuno's 'Hundred Strikes' attack.<p>Senjuu Konbo "One Hundred Tens Clubs"- Canon. This is a bit of a wierd attack. Rather than using one or two weapons and striking quickly, the user moves their hands even faster, supporting a large number of weapons, each of which is dropped after striking, and retrieved later, but before it can fall very far. Incidentally, it would actually be EASIER to use only one or two weapons. However, this technique has an advantage that offsets that. Because the user manipulates so many weapons, it becomes much more difficult and lengthy to disarm them or stop the attack. On the other hand, it requires more concentration because of the extra weapons, so in the end it is a less effective attack. However, it would make for extremely good training as a step between normal and the Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken.<p>Bakusai Tenketsu Kateibun "Blasting (Pressure/Vulnerable) Points Splitting Process"- Popular. This is not always the name of this attack, others include "Bakusai Tenketsu Ha". This is the standard way for improving upon the Breaking Point- rather than causing a single shattering explosion, a series of such runs across the ground either in an expanding arc or in a straight line, as either the stones from one impact hit the correct point to start the next one OR the chi is sent through the ground so as to trigger the necessary points. This method of improving the technique has become less popular in recent fanfiction, suggesting that more people are trying to think of more original things than just making techniques bigger or faster. Bravo.<p>PART FOUR<p>THINGS THAT HAPPEN TOO MUCH<p>Sorry to say, but I have a bit of a gripe about the current trend in Ranma fanfiction.<p>There are a too many people using the same characters as everyone else. What do I mean?<p>Well, Jim Bader, who writes the most complete (and by far the LONGEST) fanfictions I have ever read, introduced a few very interesting characters.<p>For instance, Madame Lao, the owner of an incredibly wealthy and large house of ill repute (although sometimes she is on a ship instead). Or Perfume, an Amazon Enforcer who uses two large axes and suffers from a condition that makes her extremely sensitive to pain.<p>This was just fine.<p>He also introduced the concept of the Nexus, a person whose very existence would always change the universe in which they lived, and the idea of War Masters and Lore Masters.<p>This was also just great. A bunch of original ideas and characters.<p>Then something bad happened.<p>Nine out of every ten Ranma fanfiction writers began including in their fanfictions Amazon Enforcers named Perfume who had two large axes and a condition that made them extremely sensitive to pain. About seventy percent of Ranma fanfiction writers began having War Master and Lore Master plots all over the place. They appeared in mega-crossovers, in near-canon fanfictions...<p>I'm sorry, but I'm getting VERY TIRED OF IT. Jim Bader's characters were just fine. Having two or three, even forty or fifty fanfictions not by him using them was fine.<p>But when you realize that every other fanfiction you read includes ALL of the stuff of Jim Bader's that was copied, you get very bored of it, very quickly.<p>This problem has died down somewhat, but it's still there. I'm not going to say you're evil or anything for all copying him, but I will say this...<p>Please, PLEASE... if you want to add characters onto the standard Ranma cast, do it a little originally.<p>Another few things that happen all the time that are less annoying but still bug me:<p>Everyone names Souun's deceased wife Kimiko. Most Akane/Ranma fanfictions involve sudden, radical change in one or both of the main characters which brings about the romance. Most people writing Someone-other-than- Akane/Ranma mention that they hate Ranma/Akane fanfictions. Ryooga's mother is always named Hitomi. Ryooga being seen as either a righteous, beaten-down underdog or as a complete and utter bastard and spineless wimp.  The way Shampoo either is a total bimbo or a plotting, conniving shrew. People assuming both that multiple-marriages are common in Amazon culture and that all of the standard non-Amazon characters would have serious problems with this.<p>By the by, I have no problem with the whole multi-partner-marriage thing. It's just that every time one happens in a fanfiction, ALL the other characters ALSO wind up in multi-partner-marriages. Polyandry (loving more than one person at once) is entirely possible, but it sure as hell isn't that common. Please don't consider it a solution to EVERYTHING. In the end, it only makes things more boring to have it happen to all of the characters at once.<p>Finally, something that bugs me whenever I see it- Every time someone other than Ranma goes on that trip, when they come back, they have their hair like Ranma does, they fight just like Ranma does, they have multiple engagements like Ranma does- but Ranma still saves their butt all the time.  That just doesn't make sense.<p>Whew. Glad to get that outta my system, sorry if you didn't really need to read that.<p>THIS MARKS THE END OF THE SHORT RANT<p>PART FIVE<p>Things that there should be more of:<p>I have noticed that there are very few plain Ranma/Shampoo, Ranma/Kodachi, or Ranma/Kasumi matchups. This strikes me as interesting, considering that these are often among the best-written romance Ranma fics I've read. Ranma/Kodachi and Ranma/Shampoo because it requires a lot of thought to bring it to the point where the pairing can happen, and Ranma/Kasumi because, well, let's face it- noone wants to do the whole protector/protected thing, because it'll look kinda phony, so these often have interesting bases for the relationship.<p>Anyways, I'd like to see some people try writing a few more of those.<p>Also, I'd like to see a Ranma/Akane where Ryooga ends up with someone other than Ukyoo or Akari, and ends up there willingly, without heartbreak over anyone OTHER than Akane. 'Cos that doesn't happen too often.<p>Perhaps an Ah! My Goddess! crossover where Ranma DOESN'T become a god at the very beginning of the fic- that would be interesting to see.<p>Any fanfiction where Ranma learns new skills and things but does not become super-powerful.<p>And, you know, a Ranma/Sailor Moon crossover that was actually good wouldn't hurt. I've seen some of these, but they usually only last one or two short little chapters before the writer, for whatever strange reason, has stopped writing it. There have been a couple of good ones that were completed, however. For instance, the 'Sailor Ranma/ Twice in a Millenium" two-fic series was good.<p>There's one other standard-Ranma matchup I'd like to see more of, since it's pretty much never done (wierd since almost every other one is done six ways until Sunday), but I won't say it, since it'll ruin something else I'm writing if I do.<p>Gee. I have too much time on my hands, huh...<p>Oh, well. That's it for this time! Come back later for the next chapter, once I've written it! ...whenever that is...
