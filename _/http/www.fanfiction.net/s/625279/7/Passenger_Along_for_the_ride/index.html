</div>Akane quickly put herself in front of Ranma-Yasha, shielding her from most of the water. The smaller girl's quills got a bit wet, but that was all.<p>Skin red from the heat of the water, Akane charged towards the gaping Genma, who was posed after-throw, empty bucket in hands, and shoved him up against the wall.<p>"What are you trying to do, KILL your SON?" She screamed in his face.<p>Souun decided to listen to what his daughter had to say. She usually didn't get this mad when she was in the house, it must be something serious.<p>Nabiki stepped quickly over to Ranma-Yasha, to help her into the house proper from the genkan.<p>Genma asserted his right to stand on his own feet, and attempted to look serious.<p>Yasha wondered why Genma looked constipated, then returned to her quiet conversation with Nabiki, en route to the family room.<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<p>Passenger<p>Chapter 6: The Future Begins To Look Hazy<p>A Ranma 1/2 Fanfiction by S. Starblade<p>Dedicated to new writers, and writing as well as you can.<p>Warning: Just in case you haven't read this enough times, I borrow stuff. From all sorts of people. It's not plagiarism, I don't do it exactly the same. I hope.<p>Disclaimer: They AREN'T MINE, you bakas! Stop chasing me around about it! I never asked for them! You hear me? THEY'RE ALL PERVERTED JERKS! Who's a tomboy? RANMA NO BAKA! WHAM<p>Key:<p>=English<p>" " =Japanese<p>[ ] = Jusenkyou Cursed Signs<p>{ } = Chinese<p>* * = Internal conversation between Ranma and Yasha<p>(AN: No, Yasha's current name isn't permanent.)<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<p>"I was merely preparing to retrain my son!" Genma exclaimed, ignoring the entity in question entirely. "If a high school kendoist can beat him, it's obvious I've been lax in my training!" He nodded solemnly for emphasis, then discovered that it was rather difficult to nod a second time with someone's forearm lodged against his throat.<p>"You idiot!" Shouted Akane, her head seeming to inflate slightly. "YOUR SON WAS YOUR DAUGHTER AT THE TIME! You know perfectly well she can't defend herself against a martial artist, she doesn't know any martial arts like that at all! When are you going to wise up, and accept that when he's a girl, Ranma doesn't KNOW martial arts?"<p>Souun's eyes began to water, Akane was reminding him of himself, the first time he had managed a full blown demon's-head. It had been wonderful, the way it had actually surprised the Master...<p>"But," Rationalized the fat man in the (newly-stained) white gi, "That's not my son! That's a demon who's taken control of his alternate body! Demons are bad enough, imagine what she'd do if I taught HER martial arts! She's just a demon who wants to learn my martial arts and get even stronger! That's why she looks like sheurk..."<p>Akane increased the pressure on Genma's neck, and her eyes began to turn red. "Dammit, your son almost DIED today because you wouldn't train her in martial arts! Kuno was gonna KILL HER!" Each shouted word was punctuated by an inflation of Akane's head.<p>"urgle" Came Genma's eloquent riposte.<p>Akane was beginning to show fangs now, and her face had turned from angry- red to downright crimson. "And now you won't have 'your son' for a MONTH, because if we change her BACK, it could KILL HIM!"<p>Souun Tendou broke into tears ( Cry # 70 (first appearance) : My Heir Just Spontaneously Learned My Favorite Chi Attack, I'm So Happy).<p>"Kkkhhhh" Wheezed Genma, looking surprised.<p>Akane was in full blown demon-head, complete with little spirit doodles floating around her face. "And it's ALL because YOU are a STUBBORN, STUPID, ARROGANT, LAZY A-"<p>Oh, my FREAKING GOD!<p>Startled out of her subconscious Demon's-head attack, Akane let Genma fall to the floor in favor of running to see what had scared Kasumi. She couldn't help but think, though...<p>******<p>*So THAT'S the rest of the sentence.* Yasha commented to Ranma, as she calmly sat, legs extended in front of her, looking up at a stunned Kasumi.<p>You speak English? The demon-girl asked, not really expecting an answer. Poor Kasumi looked stunned enough to remain still through Armageddon.<p>Akane ran in. "What's the matter, Kasumi? What scared you? Where is it? Can I kill it? Where? What's-"<p>And screeched to a halt, to see Kasumi staring aghast at the bandaged Ranma- Yasha. "Oh, you mean that... Yeah, it looks pretty bad, doesn't it?"<p>Kasumi shook it off enough to answer. "No, I only speak a little English..."<p>"Drat." Replied Ranma-Yasha. "I was hoping for decent conversation... is real pain not speaking language of home, yes?"<p>Absent nod. "I imagine it would be."<p>The small girl nodded in agreement. "Nabiki will explain. Akane, if would help me to bed, would be much obliged... am very tired..."<p>Akane also nodded, then paused, wondering if perhaps it was contagious, this nodding. She decided to worry about it later, and moved to help Ranma- Yasha to the guest room.<p>******<p>Dinner was again a rather quiet affair at the Tendou-ke.<p>"..and I guess Mr. Saotome can't really sleep in the same room as poor Ranma for now. I know! She can sleep in my room. I'll get out the extra futon. Of course, we can't move her when she's already asleep, so Ojisan can sleep in the dojo tonight. Oh, and I can keep Ranma company during the day, because I'm home most of the time! Oh, this is wonderful! Not poor Ranma getting hurt of course. That's just awful. I'm sure that Kuno-san will be sorely punished for that. What I meant, was that it's wonderful that Uncle, Father and I are here all day to keep poor Ranma company, and care for her. And when she's recovered enough, I can start teaching her my recipies..."<p>Or would have been, but Kasumi had decided to make up for the lack of speech from the others by conversing enough for all of them. None of them noticed of course, being deep in thought.<p>Akane was thinking of what she would do to Kuno for this. Maybe if she took his bokken and rammed it THERE, and then tied his sleeves like so... It wasn't that she thought Ranma was nice, or anything, it's just that Kuno really needed a lesson this time. That's all. Nothing else. Really.<p>Nabiki was thinking of what she would do to Kuno for this. Maybe he would think twice if he were several hundred thousand yen less rich... Now, how to get the money off of him... Maybe anti-demon charms? No, too ironic. Hmmm...<p>Souun wasn't thinking of what he would to do Kuno for this. Nor was he noticing that Nabiki's little winged yen bills were roosting on his shoulder. He was, however, crying faster than he ate (#71: My Son In Law Got the Tar Beaten Out of Him and is Stuck as a Girl for Now, and simultaneously # 4: My Eldest Daughter Cooks So Well).<p>Genma was trying to think. To his credit, he was accomplishing a reasonable facsimile of thinking about something other than food, sleep, and training Ranma. It wasn't quite right, though. It went something like this:<p>The demon that took over my son's body wants to learn my martial arts. It wants to learn my martial arts so that it can beat me. Therefore, I will teach it martial arts to keep it happy, but I will only teach it stuff I know how to beat, so that when it tries to beat me, I can stop it. That way, everyone's happy, and I'm safe.<p>******<p>Satan grinned evilly. No, more evilly. No, that's demented. I mean EVILLY. As in, normally he only grins kind of evilly, now he was grinning so evilly that the top of his head had almost split off. Watching Genma was going to be fun. If he couldn't stop the hail down here, he could at least get a vacation.<p>Then a particularly sharp one landed on his foot, and he proceeded to jump around a bit, cursing.<p>******<p>Yahweh sat on Yggdrasil, monitering things through a few flatscreens. This Doublet thing was fun. Especially since, via Yggdrasil, you could watch your Doublet counterpart...<p>******<p>Yasha woke up, sat up, and almost screamed.<p>That HURT.<p>In the back of her mind, Ranma, protected by his unconsciousness, roused enoug to protest the fact that it was morning and painful this damned early, and went back to sleep.<p>Yawning thinly, in an attempt not to aggravate her injuries, Yasha looked at the clock on the wall. Yep. 5:00 AM. Couldn't get away from that internal alarm clock even by travelling halfway around the globe, what had made her think getting pulped would turn it off?<p>Oh, well. Nothing for it but to get up. Now... with these casts like this, she would have to...<p>Twisting about in a way that would have surprised anyone but an experienced contortionist, and that left her gasping in pain, Yasha managed to get herself standing with the crutch under her left arm. Carefully, she straightened out her newly-amputated pajamas (the ones with the little demon-repelling ofuda decoration pictures) and step-thumped her way to the stairs.<p>******<p>Ten minutes later, she reached the bottom just as Kasumi started down the stairs herself, headed for the bath.<p>"Wait, Ranma- I'll give you a hand." She directed, in a tone that clearly implied that this was just a polite command. "You shouldn't be up and about on your own, without your neck brace on. Really. You might injure yourself more if you're not careful." She chastized, finishing as she reached the foot of the stairs.<p>"Am sorry, Kasumi-san... Is just, I was awake, and I not want to wait with nothing to do. I was going to take bath now... Will wait for you, yes?" Yasha would have looked down but for the need to avoid moving her neck unneccesarily.<p>To her utmost surprise, Kasumi looked her in the eyes without appearing at all disturbed, smiled and said kindly, "You'll do no such thing. I will help you bathe. You certainly can't clean all of yourself with those casts on, can you? You won't be able to reach everything."<p>The smaller girl grinned ruefully, taking her arm off the crutch for a moment. "Wanting to bet?" She asked, folding her left arm behind her, elbow at her spine, and waving to Kasumi over her right shoulder with her left hand, palm away from her own back. "Besides," She continued, regaining her grip on the crutch with little difficulty, "Am really boy. Are you sure is okay? I think... ah... father of Kasumi... would be very upset to find out. Is nice for you offer, anyway..."<p>"Oh, just come on. I really don't mind. Besides, it's not like you haven't seen a girl naked before." Something occured to Kasumi. "You HAVE bathed as a girl before, right?"<p>Ranma-Yasha nodded. Of course she had. After all, heated rivers and lakes weren't exactly common, and most hot springs had entrance fees. Not that that had ever stopped Genma, but she ( and Ranma ) tended to have slightly better social morals than him. On his best day.<p>"Well, then, it's not a problem. Besides, noone's getting a bath if we stand here talking all morning. Here, I'll help you there."<p>Aquiescing, although not entirely reluctant, Yasha submitted to Kasumi's aid, both in heading to the bathroom, and getting undressed.<p>******<p>Feeling very naked, Yasha looked around. This was her first time in a genuine traditional Japanese bathroom. Back before she'd joined Ranma, she'd heard all sorts of wonderful things about what a good soak in a furo could do for you, and as, at the time, she'd been too large to actually be mostly underwater in an American bathtub, had been looking forward to the experience. Since she couldn't soak in hot water, however, she would have to skip on that one for a while.<p>Yasha really wasn't looking forward to this morning's bath. With her condition and the casts, she'd have to take a cold sponge-bath. While she was perfectly capable of ignoring cold, cold and wet had always been an altogether different situation for her. And since coming to live with Ranma, in her smaller body, she'd found her physical tolerance for extreme temperatures rather reduced. It irked her to no end.<p>She turned to face Kasumi as the older girl entered. Kasumi walked up to stand about three feet from Yasha, and looked the smaller girl up and down.<p>No, Kasumi wasn't interested in Ranma-Yasha's body like THAT. Get your minds out of the gutter.<p>She was merely taking the opportunity to catalogue the differences between the petite demon's body and a human one. The quills and tail were the most noticable, although now she could see something else rather unusual.<p>"Is that... fur?" She asked pointing to Ranma-Yasha's belly.<p>The demon-girl looked down and rubbed the patch of light-brown fur nearly covering her abdomen absently. "Hai. I not know why, but it start growing about week ago. Spread very slowly, at first, started maybe one-tenth that size. Is very short, too." Yasha noted that the fur-covered area wasn't actually cold as the rest of her was.<p>"May I touch it?" This while reaching forward tenatively.<p>"Ah... please not, " Demured the demon-girl. "I am still not used to this body, is sometimes hard enough touch things like my own tail myself..."<p>Kasumi nodded. "I suppose I understand."<p>Kasumi waited for Ranma-Yasha to take a seat.<p>And waited.<p>And waited.<p>The smaller girl was just standing there, looking a bit cold, temperature- wise. She was occasionally looking at the stools or at Kasumi's bucket of bath supplies. She also seemed to be avoiding looking at Kasumi anywhere but her face.<p>Kasumi sweatdropped. "You... don't know how to use a bathroom to clean yourself properly, do you..."<p>Yasha scratched the top of her head, careful not to spear her fingers on her quills. "Ahhhh... I not want look dumb, use wrong thing wrong time or wrong way..." She was gradually getting more nervous.<p>Kasumi took pity on the poor girl, pulling up a couple of stools and gently seating her on one.<p>Yasha, meanwhile, was trying to figure out if it was good or bad that Ranma was still asleep. On one hand, he could tell her what to do if he was awake. On the other, he would probably be totally freaked out. The first time they had bathed female, he'd almost totally lost it. With Kasumi here, bathing too... She decided not to risk it.<p>The disparity in size between the two girls became even more apparent when Kasumi and Yasha sat on the stools. Kasumi's knees were level with her belly button, while Yasha's good leg made an almost right angle at the knee.<p>Hoping fervently that Ranma wouldn't wake up, Yasha took the soapy, damp cloth Kasumi handed her. When Kasumi started cleaning herself, Yasha carefully mimicked her every move, except those that would have involved not wearing a cast. She had to stretch wayyyyyyy out to wash her toes, too.<p>******<p>Akane headed down to the bathroom, as usual, at about 5:30, to get a light rinse in before her morning jog. Oh, good, Kasumi was already in there. They could scrub each others' backs. That was always nice, because then she and Kasumi could discuss the goings-on in Nerima of late. It was one of the few places where Kasumi said much, other than Oh, my. and "Dinner's ready!"<p>Unfortunately, Kasumi had gotten Yasha undressed first, so her nightgown was sitting on top of Yasha's pajamas, concealing them.<p>******<p>Ranma-Yasha blinked as Kasumi motioned for her to turn around.<p>"You want I turn around?" She asked, puzzled.<p>"Of course. How else would I wash your back for you?"<p>Yasha was even more glad Ranma was still "asleep". She turned around. "Just touch only as much as need for cleaning."<p>Nodding, Kasumi started by taking hold of the bow on the demon-girl's "ponytail" of quills.<p>Yasha almost jumped. "Wait, be caref-"<p>SPROINGG<p>Kasumi's eyes widened as most of Yasha's quills took to standing straight out from her head, making her look like she was wearing a porcupine for a wig. Kasumi had narrowly avoided having her nose scratched by the quills.<p>Enough quills were still down to give the appearance of long hair, though, and Kasumi carefully lifted them out of the way. Now that she could see Ranma-Yasha's back, she was surprised to find a strip of short fur down the girl's spine, running from the base of her skull to the base of her tail.<p>"You have fur on your back, too..."<p>The demon-girl blinked. "Is new, then. Not have two days ago."<p>Kasumi began washing the smaller girl's back, taking special care to soap up the furred area. The girl was certainly going through some major changes. It was almost like when she herself had gone through... puberty?  Maybe that was it? Ranma's female body might be going through puberty. After all, she could stand to gain quite a bit of height, and had obviously only just began "growing" in a rather important respect...<p>******<p>Undressed, Akane stepped up to the door into the furo area. She took with her only a towel, not expecting to wash until after her jog. She wasn't using it to cover any "important bits". After all, it was just Kasumi.<p>******<p>Kasumi continued to wash Ranma-Yasha's back until she reached the base of the demon-girl's tail, when she was interrupted by the involuntary arching of the smaller girl's back. Apparently, that spot was rather sensitive.<p>Right then, Akane opened the furo door.<p>To see Yasha sitting bolt upright, back arched, and Kasumi (apparently) grabbing the smaller girl's butt.<p>Three things ran through Akane's mind:<p>Kasumi is grabbing another (badly injured) girl by the butt, and the other girl looks like she likes it. A lot.<p>Ranma is in the furo area with Kasumi, and both are naked.<p>She couldn't pummel Ranma because he was:<p>a) a girl, and so entitled to be in the furo with other girls<p>b)injured, and so unable to defend herself, and<p>c)a guest who might become family.<p>Kasumi looked wide-eyed at Akane, realizing why her sister had frozen up, and immediately retracted her hand, blushing furiously.<p>Yasha half-relaxed, then bent 90 degrees left and then right at her waist, causing her spine to emit cement-mixer sounds. And then winced in pain.<p>Then she noticed Akane, and froze.<p>Hold tableaux for 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...<p>"Ranmaaaa nooooo..." Wait. Ranma was a girl right now, she couldn't be molesting Kasumi. As a matter of fact, it had looked more like Kasumi was molesting her.<p>But, Kasumi wasn't a hentai. That just wasn't possible. You might as well try to convince someone in Nerima that a pile of rocks made a good breakfast. Someone HUMAN in Nerima, anyways.<p>But Ranma wasn't being a hentai either. She was looking Akane in the face, apparently very scared.<p>Akane absently noted that Ranma-Yasha was growing fur.<p>Then her mind took the last option.<p>There were three people here: Her, Ranma, and Kasumi.<p>Something hentai was being done by someone.<p>It wasn't Ranma, and it wasn't Kasumi...<p>Ranma-Yasha and Kasumi looked on in shock as Akane shouted, "AKANE NO HENTAI!" And malleted herself in the head. Hard.<p>The two others continued to look on in shock as Akane, malled embedded in her own head, slumped to the floor unconscious. And they sweatdropped.<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<p>I know, I know. It looks like I've basically pulled Ranma out of this for about a month or so. Emphasis on looks like. C'mon, this is a manga/anime, and the main character, too, that we're talking about here. It won't take that long.<p>I'll bet now different people are complaining that we don't get to see how Ranma will deal with Yasha having her menarche. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we?<p>And what, exactly, is going to happen with Genma and Yasha?<p>And will Yasha ever get a real name?<p>That depends on what I come up with, and when. Please review, but constructive only. If it sucks, say WHY. And suggestions are welcome. Oh, and whoever-it-was that wanted to use my alternative nickname for Kuno, go right ahead. If I wanted to keep it to myself, I wouldn'ta wrote it where everyone else could read it.<p>Till next time, Jaa, mata!
