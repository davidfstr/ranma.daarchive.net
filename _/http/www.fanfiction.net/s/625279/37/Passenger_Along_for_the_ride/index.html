</div>On a mountain somewhere in Japan, the remains of a rockslide shifted, then a number of rocks fell, rolling the rest of the way down the mountain. Out into the midnight air stepped a tiny, shriveled man.<p>"Free! Free at last! Now I can go back to-"<p>He was cut off by a loud rumbling sound. He looked up the mountain and his eyes widened comically on his tiny little face.<p>"Oh, no, not again..."<p>Happosai dived back into the cave just in time to avoid being crushed by another massive avalanche.<p>Up on the top of the mountain, Ryooga looked around.<p>"Why does this place look familiar?" He wondered aloud, then shrugged and picked up his pack. The rock it had been sitting on shifted and fell, triggering a third rockslide, burying the cave even further.<p>There was the sound of extremely muffled cursing from somewhere down the mountain.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~<p>Passenger Chapter 32: Mist Rising From Ice<p>A Ranma 1/2 fanfiction by Selene Starblade Dedicated to coincidence and happenstance.<p>Disclaimer: The majority of the characters in this work do not belong to me, they belong to Takahashi Rumiko. Hopefully she doesn't mind my borrowing them for my own purposes.<p>Key: Things in are in English Things in " " are in Japanese Things in [ ] are on Juusenkyo cursed signs Things in { } are in Chinese Things in * * are only heard by Ranma and Kodora, because they're in mental communication<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~<p>Ranma sat in his favorite tree at lunch, relaxing with the remains of his bento balanced in his lap.<p>*Okay, so first things first, Ranma- who are you going to partner with for the challenge with Mikadope?*<p>*I'm not sure. I'd choose Akane, but I'm not sure she'll be able to keep her cool. That guy'll probably try ta kiss her, and that'd likely make her go bonkers. And it's not like there's really anyone else to go with. Kasumi isn't a martial artist, really, she doesn't practice. And Nabiki's totally out of the question- she don't even ice skate.*<p>*Well, why not someone other than those three?*<p>Ranma shook his head. *Naah. I'm kinda alla their fiancee, and doing this with someone else wouldn't be appropriate.*<p>*Why not?* Kodora asked.<p>*Well, I mean, it would be like saying I don't like any of 'em. I mean, ice skatin', two people together, ya hafta touch the other person a lotta the time, and if I did that with someone else, it's kinda sayin' I'd rather touch someone else.*<p>*I... hadn't thought of that.*<p>*Yeah. And I'd ask them which one a' them wanted to do it, but that... it's like dancing, y'know? I bet they'd rather be asked personally, than sort of a 'If I could have a volunteer' kinda thing.*<p>*Hmm. Well, what if we go with the one who has the most personal stake in this?*<p>*Whadda ya mean?*<p>*Well, okay, look at it. Nabiki is right out, she doesn't skate. So, of Akane and Kasumi, which one has more reason to do this?*<p>*Hm. Lessee. Sanzenin tried to kiss Akane, but he also tried to kiss Kasumi. Matter of fact, he tried to kiss Kasumi more times than he did Akane.*<p>*Right. And how about Shiratori?*<p>*Well, Akane don't have anything personal against 'er, but she called Kasumi frumpy...*<p>*Looks like it's gonna be Kasumi, huh?*<p>*I dunno, Kodora. I mean seriously, do you really think Kasumi could get good enough in under a week to actually stand a chance?*<p>******<p>"There go." Stated Xian Pu happily, shoving the last bookshelf into place.  "Is all ready."<p>Ku Lon pogoed over on her staff, taking a look at the setup. Bookshelves all along the walls, three two-sided bookshelves towards the back, making four aisles, and a few small tables in the front for people who wanted to use reference materials or skim through part of a book before deciding.<p>"It looks very good. Nice job, great-granddaughter."<p>"Thank you, Hibachan."<p>Sin Ku stepped in the front door with a large box, immediately heading to the counter and depositing it there. She opened the side with a deft flick of her wrist, somehow cutting two diagonals into the cardboard and peeling back the four triangles of stiff paper. As she took out the cash register and plugged it in, she hummed softly.<p>Ku Lon hopped to the counter, taking a seat on the stool behind it. She immediately began going through inventory forms.<p>"Amazon-dot-com, hmm? We'll see about that."<p>"Great-grandmother?" Asked Xian Pu, sitting on a table and toying with one of her bonbori. "Why is word for women warrior use 'amazon' rather than 'Joketsuzoku'?"<p>Ku Lon didn't even look up from the forms while answering. "It's an old word. From the latin, I believe. The name for an ancient tribe of female warriors from eastern Europe. The word means literally 'without breasts.' The tribe used a lot of bows, and most of them removed one breast so as to keep it from getting in the way of the bowstring."<p>Xian Pu looked at herself, then at Sin Ku, and then back over to her great- grandmother.<p>"But, Xian Pu still have both breasts. And Xian Pu not know of anyone else who follow painful custom."<p>"Of course not, dear. Only that one tribe did. But the name has stuck. It really doesn't mean that anymore, in fact, most people don't know that it ever did mean that. Now it just refers to societies with mostly female warriors."<p>"Oh. Okay."<p>It was quiet for a while longer, then Xian Pu spoke up again. "How soon we going to find demon?"<p>Sin Ku sighed and stood up from where she had been messing with electrical cords. "Xian Pu, have you no patience?"<p>The purple-haired girl shook her head. "Is not that. Xian Pu just want some idea of how long we going be here."<p>The spiritualist shook her head. "There is no way of knowing. The demon seems to be confining itself to this area. Why that is, I don't know. Furthermore, since I can't sense how strong it is, it is much harder to tell where exactly it is. It is only barely detectable by my methods. It would probably help if we could get an idea of why it is staying here."<p>Xian Pu nodded. "So, why not ask people in area?"<p>"It's not that simple, young Battle Maiden. If the demon is indeed staying around here, it likely has controlled or persuaded some people to help hide it. They are not likely to tell just anyone. We need to gain these people's trust first, and do so without becoming conspicuous to the demon. It will take at least a month, probably longer than that. Although, if worse comes to worse, we could simply trace someone to it, and have it out right there. But I'd rather not. Demons are dangerous enough head on, cornering them makes it worse."<p>Xian Pu sighed. "Xian Pu suppose so." There was a short pause, which Sin Ku took advantage of to finish hooking up the cash register, occasionally casting a spiteful glare at the manual.<p>"Hibachan?"<p>Giving in, Ku Lon closed the booklet of forms, put it on a shelf below the counter, and turned to her descendant. "What is it Xian Pu?"<p>"Xian Pu is starving. Why could Great-grandmother not have restaurant?"<p>Ku Lon sweatdropped, and Sin Ku hid her smile by burying her nose in the manual.<p>******<p>*Hold up Ranma. Back up a bit?*<p>Ranma blinked and complied. *What is it, Kodora-chan?*<p>*Look up and to the left?*<p>Ranma looked up at the sign.<p>-Grand Opening Saturday! Kuzotsukejo Books!-<p>*Cool! A bookstore!*<p>Ranma blinked again. *What's so great about that?* He asked, continuing on his way to the dojo.<p>Kodora sighed. *You've never read anything for fun, have you Ranma?*<p>*Fun? Reading? You gotta be kidding me.*<p>*Typical.*<p>******<p>Ranma took one step into the Tendoo-ke, and immediately took a flying leap to one side.<p>"Kyaah!" Shouted Genma, landing in a flying stomp, right where Ranma had been a moment ago. Not allowing his son time to reverse direction, he took a low, charging leap towards Ranma, lashing out with one fist.<p>Ducking the blow, Ranma swept one foot out in a roundhouse kick, which was hopped over. Dodging the flying-kick counter, he grabbed his father's leg, and swung the larger man in a partial arc, aiming him at the wall. Even as Genma twisted midair and rebounded off the wall, Ranma jumped up to the roof of the house. Followed swiftly by his father, Ranma bounded across the roof and into the backyard, landing on the largest rock of the set around the koi pond. Genma took up a position on the rock on the opposite side, as Ranma tossed his schoolbag onto the veranda.<p>"You're getting sloppy, boy! All this time as a girl has made you weak!"<p>"Oh, really? This from mister panda, the household pet!"<p>Genma huffed, and leaped across the pond towards Ranma. As the younger martial artist jumped straight up, Genma bounced off the rock after him, catching up quickly. Ranma immediately launched a spinning kick, which Genma caught, spinning himself and launching Ranma back straight down.<p>Ranma was far from out of the fight, however, twisting to land on his feet.  He crouched, looking straight up at Genma, who was still about two stories up in the air, but descending fast with a falling kick.<p>Ranma waited, focusing. *Little closer... here goes!*<p>Arms spread wide, Ranma manifested a bright gold aura which thinly outlined him. Swiftly bringing his arms together, both hands cupped, he formed a bowl of his hands, the open side between his fingers pointing straight up at Genma. The aura flowed into the space between his hands.<p>"Hayabusa Ikkatsu! (Peregrine Falcon Cry)"<p>WHAM<p>Ranma slumped slightly on the rock as a somewhat battered Genma flopped down on the grass. That had taken a lot out of him...<p>Genma got up, looking somewhat irritated. "So, boy, you want to bring a chi blast into this? Fine, then, let's see how you like this!"<p>Genma pulled back one hand to punch, and it began to glow with a dark brown aura.<p>Ranma pulled his stance back together, preparing to dodge whatever was going to be thrown. He hadn't suspected his old man had it in him.<p>Genma hauled back the hand even further. "Rinretsu..."<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes. The attack was obviously going to come from Genma's hand. But his father had taught him to not be obvious, to hide his actual blows from detection until it was too late to block. So where was the real attack going to come from?<p>"KUUHUKU!" Shouted Genma, thrusting his fist forwards. The brown, bloblike aura catapulted forwards at Ranma, who on an impulse jumped straight up rather than dodging to one side.<p>The blast seemed to stop for a moment, the center halting while the outer edges spread forwards to the left and right before it collapsed in on itself right where Ranma would have been with a loud BANG.<p>Ranma landed, and stared wide-eyed at his father. "Damn! That was cool!"<p>Genma took advantage of the opportunity to slam into his son, flinging Ranma into the boundary wall. Ranma slumped to the ground and got back up, shaking his head.<p>Genma laughed. "I got ya good, boy! Hahahahaha! That'll teach you that your father's still better!"<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes and charged forward, fist at the ready, and struck Genma in the foot with his face.<p>"Hmph. Just admit it, boy, I won this round!"<p>Ranma slowly got up again. "Fine. But only 'cause I gotta go practice for the match on Saturday. I'd make ya eat those words if I had the time."<p>His father snorted. "Just see that you don't shame our school at that match, boy. I expect you to win!"<p>And with that, Genma headed back into the house to start another game of Go with Souun.<p>Ranma wandered off to the bathroom to clean up a bit, smiling.<p>*'Biting Hunger', eh? Kinda makes sense.*<p>*Particularly given Genma, ne, Ranma?*<p>*Ne, Kodora-imootochan. Still, I gotta admit, I didn't know the old man had it in him. Nice ta see he's still got stuff ta teach me.*<p>******<p>Kasumi looked up as Ranma walked into the room.<p>"Oh, hello Ranma-kun, Kodora-chan."<p>"Uh, hi Kasumi. Look, I was wondering..."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~<p>Next chapter: Ranma begins practicing for the martial arts ice-skating competition!<p>Ryooga's going to be back in town again, just in time to meet someone else...<p>And more from the amazons!<p>Sorry it took so long for this chapter- real life has taken to bludgeoning me repeatedly on the head with large objects and making off with all of my free time. Although I will say this: I'm not going to come to a complete stop on this until it's really for truly complete. I refuse to do only part of a series fic. I started it, I'm going to finish it.<p>Hey, tell me what you think of this chapter, of the whole thing, whatever! Any useful input is... well... useful.<p>"Looks like he's not coming up. He must have drowned... Oh well. Let's go."  -Hiroshi, regarding Principal Kuno, book 12 Chapter 9 "Swim like a Hammer"
