</div>Yasha sweated. Hard.<p>Kasumi, the only person in this world (with the exception of Ranma, who was more of a brother) that she considered a friend, had just figured out that Yasha wasn't actually just a female Ranma in a demon body with different knowledge. Yasha could feel it coming. She was toast. Kasumi would tell the others, and they'd all hate her, and she'd be back to just her and Ranma, and there would never be another chance to have a friend.<p>But what would come first, that was the worst part. Because every time something had blown up in her face, she had always recieved a verbal thrashing, and those hurt worst of all. She'd endured them from her father, from her teachers, from her "friends"... even, towards the time she'd left her old world behind, she'd even been getting them from her mother, the kindest, most understanding person she'd ever known. And every time someone yelled at her, she got mad at them. She didn't want to be angry at Kasumi.<p>Something was wrong, though.<p>Noone was yelling.<p>Noone was telling her how stupid she was for trying this.<p>She opened her eyes, trembling in fear, expecting Kasumi to do like her old father had once, and wait until she looked to start yelling, from mere inches away.<p>Here it came. Kasumi was under a foot away. Kasumi was...<p>...smiling? Was hugging her? Was comforting her?<p>Yasha's world had just turned on it's ear and done the hula. She broke down and cried into Kasumi's shoulder, lucky that Kasumi was strong enough to support both of their weights. Because she couldn't have stood on her own right then.<p>############################################################################ #############<p>Passenger<p>Chapter 8: Drowning in the Past<p>A Ranma 1/2 fanfiction by S. Starblade<p>Dedicated to those who help others at any cost.<p>Warning: I have borrowed things from other peoples' fanfiction, and will continue to do so. I intend no disrespect, in fact, if I borrowed from you, that means I really liked your idea. I try not to exactly copy anything, but it may still happen. Oops.<p>Disclaimer: Stop whining, boy! I know they aren't mine! But I'm using them anyways, so get used to it! It's good training to run away from lawsuits! splash [I'm just a cute little panda bear who can't be sued.]<p>Key, Ki, Kei, Chi, Tsi, Fi, Fie, Fo, Fum:<p>= English<p>" " = Japanese<p>[ ] = Jusenkyou Cursed Signs<p>{ } = Chinese<p>* * = Internal Ranma/Yasha conversation<p>&amp; &amp; = Oh, no, not this joke again...<p>############################################################################ #############<p>Kasumi was amazed at the small girl sobbing into her shoulder. The girl had obviously expected some sort of drastic punishment for trying to hide herself from everyone. She'd even looked almost like she was expecting to be struck.<p>There had been no room in the girl's eyes for remorse; there was too much fear there, edging out everything else.<p>One hand wrapped around Yasha's shoulders, Kasumi reached out with the other one, snagging the kitchen stool. Pulling it close enough, she sat down slowly, making sure not to drop the small girl. Kasumi laid the crutch down in such a way as to be easily picked back up as she rubbed Yasha's shoulder soothingly with the other hand.<p>******<p>In a bar near the other end of Nerima-cho, Souun Tendou and Genma Saotome sat at a table, brainstorming for ways to get Ranma and Akane together, and slowly, but with gradually increasing speed, getting drunk. At the rate they were going, it would be a few hours before it got to serious drinking, and by mid-afternoon, the two men would likely be either totally soused and meandering home, or completely unconscious in their seats.<p>They were greatful to Kasumi for thinking of this place to go so they could plan without Ranma overhearing.<p>If there was one thing Kasumi could do, it was think ahead.<p>******<p>Kasumi noticed that Yasha seemed almost done crying. She had long since sat the smaller girl in her own lap, so she wouldn't have to support Yasha's weight with her arms. It had been a little difficult to manage, with the smaller girl clinging to her like a drowning person would to a lifesaver.<p>"Are you feeling better now?" She asked, tenatively.<p>Without taking her face out of Kasumi's shoulder, Yasha nodded slightly. She sniffled, and mumbled something.<p>"Nani?" Kasumi asked softly.<p>Yasha turned her head to face Kasumi's other (dry) shoulder. "Domo arigatou gozaimasu, Kasumi-san..." she mumbled, tears still flowing down her face, although much slower than they had.<p>"Please," asked Kasumi, "Not so formal. You do know me, don't you? Even if you aren't who I first thought you were."<p>Yasha smiled slightly. "Not sure. Do I know you? You face looks familiar." She sniffled, and looked up at Kasumi a bit.<p>Kasumi smiled warmly in return. "Of course you do. You talked with me all of yesterday, didn't you?" A joke was good. Needed something to lighten the mood a little.<p>The smaller girl blinked, rubbing her eyes clear with one hand, the other still latched onto Kasumi's dress. "Maybe... But I remember your face if you speak to me that much. You sure I know you?" Then she looked at Kasumi's shoulder. "Oh, sorry. I ruin shoulder of your dress."<p>Kasumi eyed the wet spot on her shoulder. "No, that's all right. It's just water, and you needed to do that."<p>Yasha nodded. "Is okay then. May I stand up now, Kasumi?"<p>Kasumi smiled, nodded, and let go of the smaller girl, who managed to stand on her own without the crutch until Kasumi handed it to her.<p>"We go back-yard and talk now, Kasumi, ne?"<p>Kasumi nodded. "Ne, onna no chibi."<p>******<p>At Furinkan High, Akane and Nabiki considered Kuno.<p>The deranged Kendoist was standing in full Samurai armor, with a pair of bokken in sheaths across his back like katana, wrapped about with anti- demon wards. On his back was a banner loudly proclaiming:<p>KAME (green) TSUNAMI OF FURINKAN HIGH %DEFINITELY NOT THE "SCREAMING GAY EARTH OAR"%<p>Everyone avoided Kuno that day.<p>The only people who had to change their habits to do so were Akane, Nabiki, and the Kendo club.<p>The other remarkable thing was that Kuno was late to every class that day. It is very difficult to go through doorways normally wearing full Nobori- Nin (Banner Bearer) armor.<p>PE was also interesting, as Kuno tried to swim in his armor.<p>Fortunately, he had been absent the previous day, and so Akane and Nabiki had cooled down a little.<p>******<p>"Akane Tendo! I would date with URK"<p>"That'll be fifty thousand yen for talking to my sister, Kuno-chan. Or I tell her about your 'photo room'."<p>"'Photo room'? KUNO NO HENTAI!"<p>KURRRRRRUNCH!<p>But not much.<p>******<p>Yasha smiled as she sat on the back porch near Kasumi, a plate of cracker- stack snacks and two cups of cold green tea between them.<p>"Arigatou, Kasumi."<p>"That's quite alright, ah..." Kasumi paused. "...What should I call you, anyways?"<p>Yasha sipped her tea. "Ranma just call me Yasha. Is okay you call me that too. It sound nice enough to me."<p>Kasumi shook her head. "But it's not a good name to have if you look like you do. You do know what 'Yasha' means, don't you?"<p>The smaller girl barely remembered not to shake her head. "Iie, Kasumi. Am only learning Japanese still, anyways. Why? What 'Yasha' mean?" She popped a cracker-stack in her mouth and chewed while listening to the answer.<p>"'Yasha' means a demon who is female. With a name like that, people will think you really are a demon."<p>Swallowing, Yasha grinned ruefully, tail lashing slowly. "And you not think I am? Is very appropriate name. I look like I am demon."<p>Kasumi took a sip from her own tea. "Yes, but you aren't. Unless you can do some magical or otherworldly thing you haven't shown anyone here yet?"<p>"No, I no have strange ability. Not that I know, anyways." Yasha paused. "Ranma suggest 'Mizuko'."<p>Kasumi paused, a snack halfway from the plate to her mouth, and blinked. "Ranma? You mean, you can talk to him right now?"<p>"Hai. Is same when he in control. Whoever body is not, still feel and sense all thing other feel and sense, just not have control of body anymore. It feel very strange, until you adjust."<p>Kasumi nodded, then resumed her motion. After a few moments, she washed the snack down with another sip of tea. "Can you ask Ranma what he thinks of this engagement thing?"<p>Yasha giggled, the first time Kasumi had heard that sound from the girl. "I not need ask Ranma that now. Already know. He hate arrangement, but is willing to go through with it if he have to. Is matter of honor to him now, even if Oyaji have as much honor as dirty sock have good perfume. He agree, so he will live with agreement."<p>Kasumi looked up at the sky, everpresent smile slightly wider, as Yasha seemed to zone out for a moment.<p>*Hey, Ranma, why have you been so quiet all morning, anyways?*<p>*Well, I mean, it's kinda your morning right now. Not 'cuz yer in control, but 'cuz it kinda looked like you needed the breathin' space, ta deal with it on yer own. I don' think I coulda helped anyways.*<p>*Oh... Thank you, Oniisan.*<p>Mental blink.<p>*But, I'm not your brother!*<p>*You're close enough for me, and that's what matters in our head, right?*<p>*...I guess so, Imoutochan. I guess so.*<p>Yasha giggled, and Kasumi looked over at her. "Is something funny?"<p>"No, is just that Ranma is like brother to me... He just call me 'little sister'. He remind me of brother I have before I get brought here." Yasha looked a little sad now. "Is probably only person from before I miss, really."<p>Kasumi nodded, and silence reigned for a while, as the number of snacks slowly diminished.<p>******<p>"What does Ranma think of us?"<p>"Nani?"<p>"What does Ranma think of me and my sisters?" Kasumi clarified.<p>"Is good question. Hold on for moment...<p>Ranma say Akane is very angry girl, but nice when not upset. He say he want to be her friend, maybe her sensei. He think she have more potential in martial arts than she using. Also that she need work on self-control, and much more on finesse than power.<p>Nabiki, Ranma not know what to think of. He say she seem very cold, like she close self off from everyone. Is not sure, though, he not talk to her enough to know for sure. Also, he not see her much at school, but some people say she can be very... temperature? Wind chill? Icy. She can be icy."<p>Kasumi nodded. "That's about what I would expect."<p>"Ranma not sure what to think about you. You is very nice, and kind, but maybe too much. He think you maybe giving too much to family, not getting enough in return from father, from sisters. He notice that all day, sisters thank you for thing you do for them maybe once. He say they need appreciate you more. He also want teach you martial arts, you move like martial artist. Is also..."<p>"Also what?" Kasumi asked, trying not to sound too eager.<p>Yasha shook her head. "He say that is all."<p>More time passed, and Kasumi went inside for a while to set up some stuff for dinner.<p>******<p>The snack tray was replaced with a lunch tray just after Yasha finished the last cracker-stack.<p>Kasumi sat down, putting down the glasses of lemonade.<p>"I was wondering, does Ranma have any hobbies or anything?"<p>Yasha nodded. "Ranma like to carve wood. Is very good at it too." Then she laughed. "Ranma is saying he not that good, is really easy to do. Ranma too modest."<p>*Aw, c'mon, Yasha! It's just a hobby. I'm not that good. I only do a little in my spare time.*<p>*Don't depreciate yourself, Ranma! It's very difficult for some people. I only ever tried once. Nearly sliced my arm open. And I'm really good with my hands usually.*<p>"What about you? Do you have anything you do for fun?"<p>Yasha smiled wistfully, looking up into the sun. "Hai. I like to hike, and also I used to play flute. Was pretty good at that, though I usually out of practice. I wish I still have flute. And recorders. I play soprano and alto, not at same time, but indiviv... indidi... separate."<p>Kasumi nodded. "'Individual' is how you say it in Japanese."<p>"In-di-vi-du-al" Yasha carefully pronounced, each character-sound separate.<p>Kasumi smiled. "That's what we can do while you heal, I can teach you Japanese! Is that alright with you?"<p>Yasha's grin could have lit asbestos on fire. "Is WONDERFUL! I hate not speak language well. Arigatou, Kasumi"<p>Kasumi nodded again. "By the by, how old were you before you 'joined', so to speak, with Ranma?"<p>The smaller girl's grin hardly faded as she answered. "Was eighteen, almost nineteen. Three months off from nineteen, actually."<p>******<p>Eventually...<p>"So," Began Kasumi, "We still need a name for you. After all, we can't just call you Ranma, and I refuse to let you name yourself 'Yasha'. It's just not right. What was your name Before?"<p>Yasha frowned. "I not want use name from Before. Was not very good life, was not very good person. I not want be same as I was before. I was very unhappy that way. I need new name, one not relate to old life.<p>"Hmmmm..." Kasumi said, gently biting her lip in thought. "What are your favorite things?"<p>Yasha blinked. She had thought they were talking about naming her... "Colors are purple and green, best together. I like calamari, music, and drawing. Very much I like singing and dancing."<p>"Okay, what about... Kangakkiko?"<p>The small girl made a face. "Is big mouthful."<p>"Maybe... Megara?"<p>"Maybe, maybe. Other ideas?"<p>"Well, there's always Ranko, the female version of Ranma, but that's a little... corny."<p>" I agree. Other idea maybe?"<p>"Kikuko? Maybe Reiko? Or, how about Ryoko?"<p>"No, are just not feel right. And last one is like cartoon character, make me look silly. Hair and fangs like her enough for me."<p>"Ahhh... Yoiko? Maybe Kodora?"<p>"What was last one? 'Little Tiger'? That sound nice."<p>"Yes, but it's a little... tomboyish. Maybe Dorako?"<p>"'Tiger child'? Sound just as man as Kodora, to me."<p>WHAM!<p>Both girls jumped at the manner in which Souun and Genma announced their return.<p>"Awful rrrrude of th' chillern t' move th' fron' gate like that, Tenno!"<p>Souun began to bawl. Again. (# 73: Someone Moved My Front Gate While I Was Out Drinking)<p>"WAAAAH! It'sh nhot my ffffallt! WAAAAAH! I bringededed upp my chillren right! They juss' not respect me!"<p>The two girls exchanged a look before Kasumi went to help the fathers to their rooms, hopefully before Akane and Nabiki got back.<p>The currently-nameless girl sat thinking about what to call herself, absently noting the feeling of the fur falling out all down her back and across her abdomen. This was the third time that had happened. Almost as though her body hadn't decided what it was going to be yet.<p>############################################################################ #############<p>Been checking my reviews, and all I can say is 'Wow.' I never thought enough people would like something I wrote. But, for you all, I will keep it up. Besides, it's fun sometimes. The rest of the time it's very fun. Well, GTG! Jaa, mata!<p>"Curse you, Saotome!" Kuno growled, achieving surprising results (AN: in digging through a pile of rubble) though he was using a bokken instead of a shovel, "None has the right to defeat you but Kuno Tatewaki! I shall not permit you to be defeated by a mere building full of debris! The Blue Thunder will have his revenge only after I have freed you!"<p>-Tatewaki Kuno, "The Fifth Fiancee"
