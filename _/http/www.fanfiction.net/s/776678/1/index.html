</div>"Ranko, honey," Akane called out, knocking on the<br/>door. She knew Ranko resented being treated like a<br/>child, but Akane really couldn't help herself at<br/>times. She was rewarded with a kind of mumbled<br/>response. "You have classes today."<p>"So?" she protested from the room. Akane arched an<br/>eyebrow. Whatever part of Ranma's personality that<br/>made him a morning person did not seem to have made it<br/>into Ranko's make up when they were split by the twin<br/>water.<p>"I'm sure Ranma would be glad to wake you up," Akane<br/>said smirking. The muttering in Ranko's room got a<br/>little louder.<p>"All right, all right," Ranko protested. Akane could<br/>hear her sitting up and stretching and smiled as the<br/>girl padded to wearily to the door and opened it.<p>Ranko stood there in her long Utena T-shirt, blinking<br/>awake reluctantly. She was still wearing her dark red<br/>hair in imitation of Nabiki's helmet style, though at<br/>the moment the hair was mussed and wild from a night<br/>in bed. And of course the marks. The blue triangles at<br/>her eyes and the white dot in the center of her<br/>forehead.<p>"What do I need to go to college for anyway?" Ranko<br/>asked. "It's not like I'm going to need to know what<br/>an hippo bowl is. Or the hospital's law. Or who Duke<br/>Fergy is and what he had to do with the War of<br/>Lilies."<p>"Do you mean hyperbole, l'Hopital's rule, and Duke<br/>Ferdinand who's assassination started World War I?"<br/>Akane asked, smirking. Ranko crossed her arms and<br/>glared. "You're taking three classes, Ranko. Ranma and<br/>I each have a full load."<p>"Yeah, yeah," Ranko muttered. She continued muttering<br/>angrily in Chinese as she walked back into her room to<br/>get ready for the day. Akane cleared her throat and<br/>Ranko turned to look at her.<p>"My Chinese class has been going quite well," Akane<br/>said. Ranko blushed and laughed nervously as she<br/>turned back to her morning habits. Akane smirked as<br/>she walked away from the girl's room to go speak to<br/>her husband.<p>Ranma was wrapping up a kata as she came into the<br/>dojo. She took a moment to admire his form and leaned<br/>against the wall. He finished the kata and looked to<br/>her as he finished the kata step perfect. Behind him,<br/>the phantom afterimage of his high-speed passage<br/>swiftly faded into nothing.<p>"Need me to wake her up?" Ranma asked.<p>"No, she's up," Akane said. "She's complaining about<br/>having to go to school, but she's up."<p>"Think she's any feeling any better?" Ranma asked<br/>seriously.<p>"She seemed okay," Akane said. "But basically she<br/>just got told that she'd be a child for the rest of<br/>her existence. From her perspective anyway."<p>"Maybe we should take a day off and just go do<br/>something," Ranma said.<p>"That'll just make her feel more like a child," Akane<br/>said. Not mentioning the way she acted on waking Ranko<br/>up.<p>******<p>Ranko looked at the outfit Shampoo had made for her,<br/>and Nabiki had apparently enchanted. That was big,<br/>Nabiki still did not like magic. So the fact that she<br/>had gone ahead and enchanted the outfit showed what<br/>she thought. Then again, it was probably because<br/>Nabiki still felt partially responsible for her<br/>"birth."<p>She had planned to wear it when she finally was<br/>declared an adult by Amazon law. That would never<br/>happen now. The Amazons didn't want her, aside from<br/>those few that lived in Nerima, and most of them<br/>weren't real Amazons.<p>She glanced back at the letters Nabiki and Shampoo<br/>had written to her. One was in Japanese and the other<br/>in Chinese. They both said practically the same thing.<br/>Basically to ignore the old idiots on the council and<br/>just got on with life.<p>"You are a very courageous warrior," Shampoo said.<br/>"Forget what the council says. They are, many of them,<br/>too hidebound." Nabiki was more succinct.<p>"Just wear the damn outfit," Nabiki said. Ranko liked<br/>that about the other woman, she knew how to make her<br/>point. But she couldn't do that, the garb was for an<br/>adult, fully accepted, Amazon warrior. Ranko wasn't<br/>even a person by the Council's standards. She was a<br/>product of the pools and that was it.<p>Ranko stuffed the outfit's box back into its keeping<br/>place and dug out some sweats and another T-shirt. The<br/>t-shirt was silver on black and portrayed an obviously<br/>female werewolf with the English words "Black Furies"<br/>pasted across the back. Then it was time to fix her<br/>hair and on to meet Ranma and Akane before the three<br/>of them went to college.<p>She glanced at the box holding her aunts' gift and<br/>sighed before shutting off the room light. These<br/>"modern" clothes had an attitude she liked, and she<br/>wouldn't give them up. It didn't mean that she didn't<br/>still want that outfit. Despite knowing she'd never be<br/>able to wear it now.<p>******<p>"I thought this was supposed to be an advanced<br/>engineering school," Skuld mumbled as she sat in the<br/>back of one of the classes. "Even Keiichi is light<br/>years beyond this stuff. Feh."<p>She scrunched up her brows in frustration and quietly<br/>left the auditorium. Even if it was simple stuff she<br/>wasn't about to interrupt a bunch of students in<br/>learning about the glories of technology.<p>After all. She wasn't Urd.<p>She kicked a stone across the courtyard as she looked<br/>about for a convenient pool of water to port back home<br/>with. She just bet that the other classes weren't any<br/>better. She just bet that the literary department had<br/>probably never even heard of Snorri Sturlson or the<br/>Elder Edda. She paused.<p>"Okay," she admitted. "That's a little harsh."<p>She looked up at a trio of students apparently<br/>meeting for lunch. At least two of them seemed related<br/>somehow, and the other two were definitely close. Very<br/>close, but Skuld wouldn't have looked long enough to<br/>notice that if she hadn't caught a glimpse of one of<br/>the girls' faces.<p>The girl, a Japanese-Chinese girl with dark red hair<br/>and a rather unsatisfied expression on her face that<br/>Skuld could appreciate, had a trio of blue marks on<br/>her face.<p>"Another goddess down here?" Skuld blinked and took<br/>out her analysis goggles. She slipped them on to<br/>ascertain whether she was just seeing someone with odd<br/>tastes in tattoos or if, yes it was another goddess<br/>hanging around with those two mortals.<p>As she activated the goggles her eyes threatened to<br/>bulge out of their confines. Skuld nearly walked into<br/>a tree in her surprise. She had to correct her first<br/>estimation. There were no mortals in that little<br/>group after all. In fact, life patterns indicated<br/>that the guy was the goddess's father.<p>~I wonder what they're doing here,~ Skuld wondered.<br/>She blinked a couple of times and then smiled broadly.<br/>~This is just like one of those American Nancy Drew<br/>books! Cool!~ Never mind the fact any group sent by<br/>heaven to Earth would probably be looking to avoid<br/>attention. Skuld had been bored, now she had<br/>something to do.<p>She noticed the guy turning in her direction and<br/>quickly ducked behind a tree, damping her aura as she<br/>did so. When she next peeked around the tree they<br/>were gathering up their lunch trays. The two humans,<br/>obviously lovers if not married, talked for a few<br/>moments to the goddess and then the three of them<br/>traveled off to their various classes.<p>It took Skuld all of two seconds to decide which to<br/>follow. After all, the goddess was a fledgling and<br/>less likely to spot her than the other two.<p>~Black furies?~ she thought, reading the back of the<br/>girl's shirt. ~Feh, Sons of Ether are better any day<br/>of the week.~<p>******<p>Ranko leaned into her hand and yawned as she tried to<br/>listen to the teacher lecture about world history. To<br/>tell the truth this class really bothered her. It<br/>sort of rammed home the fact that her memories were<br/>completely screwed up. Then again, studying with her<br/>"father" showed that, even with swiss cheese memories,<br/>she knew more than he did.<p>That was really pathetic actually.<p>Ranko grimaced as she listened to the teacher talking<br/>about the Japanese conquest of eastern China during<br/>World War II. To think that this little island had<br/>ever reached such power, it was almost unfathomable to<br/>her.<p>Even more disturbing was the fact that America had<br/>then beaten Japan in the war. Even after Japan had<br/>gotten the first major shots into the war. With the<br/>gaijin fighting another war at the same time. It was<br/>more than a little surprising.<p>Ranko shivered and scratched the back of her head,<br/>stretching back. She felt a little nervous for some<br/>other reason, a little tickling at the base of her<br/>skull that told her she was being watched. She<br/>glanced around the lecture hall for a moment, and<br/>fought down the twinge of fear she felt.<p>She didn't see anyone that looked threatening, but<br/>moved cautiously, none the less, as the class ended.<br/>Collecting her books she slung her bag over her<br/>shoulder and walked to the door watching for anybody<br/>staring at her.<p>~I'm losing it,~ she thought irritably, slamming her<br/>fist into the wall to her side. She grimaced<br/>irritably and shook out her hand from the hit.<br/>Another reminder of the reason why the Amazon's<br/>wouldn't let her even try to take the trials.<p>She stalked irritably down towards the computer lab,<br/>thankful to Nabiki for introducing her to the<br/>internet. If she was lucky, then there would be a new<br/>move on the White Wolf game up and she could work out<br/>her frustrations a little by writing a good combat<br/>post.<p>~I'm turning into one of those weak-kneed techno<br/>dependants.~ Ranko sighed guiltily as she considered<br/>the Amazon council's probable reaction to her<br/>enjoyment of the online community. Despite this, she<br/>sat down at a computer and proceeded to hunt and peck<br/>the proper keys to pull up her mail account.<p>~Post up!~ Ranko mentally chimed as she bent forward<br/>to read the post. ~Let's see what miss 'Greatest GM<br/>in the Universe' has for us now.~<p>She only put up with computers because of this game.<br/>Since finding it two years ago she had felt less like<br/>a cripple. Suddenly the huge leaps, superhuman speed<br/>and strength, all those things that the transformation<br/>of her chi into...whatever...had taken from her. It<br/>was all hers again. Sort of.<p>There was a private email after that, from the devil<br/>tiger's player. Someone going by the name<br/>"Bloodletter." That she opened just as eagerly, if<br/>with some trepidation. Bloodletter and her's<br/>friendship seemed mostly based on shared misery, and<br/>that was sometimes a let down.<p>This time it was just game talk, she was giving Ranko<br/>some forewarning of stuff her kuei jin would be doing,<br/>but at the end of the private mail was a quick<br/>question about her quest with the Amazons and Ranko<br/>twitched a little irritably.<p>That was the problem with the sort of my problem, your<br/>problem friendship she had with the woman. Bad news<br/>eventually got dredged up. She sent a reply out,<br/>editing out Bloodletter's stuff and turning into a<br/>mail to all the players. She figured she might as<br/>well apologize in case she had gotten or was about to<br/>get snipey.<p>"Guncat?" she blinked. ~What's Guncat doing up,<br/>isn't it like the middle of the night over there?~<br/>She read the response and smirked.<p>"You Idiot!" Annie shouts. "You're going to let<br/>every damn ghoul in the place know we're here!"<br/>Annie growls irritably and proceeds to lay down<br/>covering fire for whatever the stupid dog doesn't<br/>notice. Using her specially made...<p>Guncat's bastet loved her guns.<p>Then again, considering the ultra technical nature of<br/>some of her posts, so did Guncat. Neobomb did the<br/>same thing with her creations, and Ranko had to admit<br/>her fighting posts were rather choreographed. The<br/>things Bloodletter got obsessive about<br/>were...disturbing. She shrugged, that's what the game<br/>was for after all, letting yourself go.<p>That feeling of being watched persisted and Ranko<br/>looked up to glance around the room. The only thing<br/>unusual she found was what looked like a fourteen year<br/>old kid at a computer a few rows back. She skipped<br/>over the girl after a moments inspection of the back<br/>of her skull. She shrugged the feeling away again.<p>******<p>Skuld glanced away from the computer and back towards<br/>her quarry. She relaxed upon seeing that the redhead<br/>with the helmet cut was still there, and typing at an<br/>abysmally slow rate. Skuld rolled her eyes and turned<br/>back to the school computer to pull up another<br/>internet window while the first tried to pull up<br/>Yggdrasil.<p>Skuld glanced over her mail and growled as she came<br/>to one mail.<p>"Ha!" she snapped. "I knew she'd do that!" She<br/>covered her mouth and laughed nervously at the people<br/>next to her. Glancing back she saw that the redhead<br/>hadn't seemed to notice her at all.<p>~That werewolf,~ she thought, smirking. ~Always good<br/>to get the bad guy's attention. Of course Guncat's<br/>probably going to post something like...there it is<br/>already. She's up late.~ She read the post and<br/>huffed a little irritably. ~Doesn't she trust me to<br/>handle the security system, sheesh.~<p>She glanced back to check on the mystery goddess's<br/>position and noted her collecting her things. Skuld<br/>twitched and bent forward to finish up her task of<br/>replying to the general carnage in the game and then<br/>sign out of both windows before getting out of her<br/>chair to get back on the redhead's tail. Her<br/>neighbors were left staring in shock at where Skuld<br/>had displayed a typing ability that nearly pushed the<br/>keyboard's limits. And it was obvious she was holding<br/>back.<p>******<p>"Skuld said she'd be on campus today," Belldandy said<br/>Keiichi as she moved into step next to him.<p>"Maybe she decided to stay home after all," Keiichi<br/>said hopefully. Indicating that he hadn't seen the<br/>young goddess either.<p>"I hope nothing is wrong," Belldandy said.<p>They passed a younger student, she almost looked like<br/>she still belonged in high school actually. The woman<br/>paused in her task, pinning a poster to a bulletin<br/>board, and turned to face them, a puzzled look on her<br/>face. There was an economy of motion to her actions<br/>that was easily evident.<p>"Excuse me," the woman said warily. Belldandy and<br/>Keiichi turned to face her, also cautious. Encounters<br/>like this rarely meant good news.<p>"Hey, Akane," someone shouted down the hall. The<br/>woman turned toward the voice and smiled as she walked<br/>to meet the speaker. A young man a little taller than<br/>her. Where the woman seemed graceful and economic in<br/>her motions, the young man seemed to almost be made of<br/>air.<p>"Ranma," the woman, apparently Akane, responded<br/>cheerfully. Then she frowned. "I thought you were<br/>still in class." She didn't say anything more with<br/>the witnesses right there. The young man, apparently<br/>Ranma, laughed nervously and scratched the back of his<br/>head.<p>"They let out..." Ranma's voice sort of trailed off as<br/>he saw Belldandy. Keeping his eye on Belldandy, he<br/>inclined his head toward Akane. "Am I seeing what I<br/>think I'm seeing?"<p>"Looks like it," Akane said, again looking at<br/>Belldandy.<p>"Excuse me," Keiichi said. "But what's the deal?"<p>"Do we know you perhaps?" Belldandy asked, starting<br/>to open up her senses. She wished that Skuld had been<br/>there so she could ask for a more detailed scan of the<br/>pair.<p>"Sorry," Ranma said shaking his head clear. "But<br/>where did you get those marks on your face."<br/>Belldandy's eyes widened as she felt the power<br/>emanating from the two.<p>"Ranma!" Akane gasped, jabbing him with an elbow.<p>"Listen pal," Keiichi said moving up into Ranma's<br/>face. "It's sort of rude to talk about people like<br/>that."<p>"Hey, I was just askin," Ranma started.<p>"Keiichi be careful," Belldandy said, watching the<br/>two carefully. Keiichi glanced back and saw<br/>Belldandy's serious, cautious face and wondered what<br/>he had just gotten himself into.<p>"Please excuse my husband," Akane said<br/>apologetically. "His father didn't really bother to<br/>teach him about dealing with people. I'm Saotome<br/>Akane." She bowed with a cheerful, disarming smile.<br/>Belldandy relaxed marginally.<p>"I suppose that's okay," Belldandy said.<p>"You haven't said what your problem is," Keiichi<br/>said. Ranma and Akane looked over him in a manner<br/>that made him uncomfortable.<p>"Ya got an impressive aura guy," Ranma said. "But<br/>you ain't a fighter." There was no threat in the<br/>sentence, just a statement of fact. Keiichi sweated<br/>anyway.<p>"Ranma," Akane said warningly.<p>"Yeah, I know," Ranma said, sighing. "Look it's just<br/>that we know someone with those same marks almost.<br/>'Cept the one on the forehead."<p>"Oh," Belldandy said, relaxing a deal more at that.<br/>"Who would that be?"<p>"She's my...daughter," Ranma said hesitantly. "Sort<br/>of." Belldandy and Keiichi stared at him in shock for<br/>a moment.<p>"You two have a..." he glanced around nervously.<br/>"...a kid that looks like Bell?"<p>"It's a long a story," Akane said. "We were just<br/>wondering if you could help us with her."<p>"Is something wrong?" Belldandy asked, still<br/>surprised.<p>"Do you know how to use your...umm," Ranma shrugged.<br/>"Life force, ta do stuff?"<p>"Of course," Belldandy said. "You're saying she<br/>can't use her mana?"<p>"Mana?" Akane said, blinking. "As in from heaven?"<br/>Belldandy blushed and Keiichi swallowed.<p>"I don't know about that," Ranma said, getting a<br/>surprised look from Belldandy. "Saffron had the same<br/>stuff, and he didn't seem very heavenly." Keiichi<br/>heard Belldandy's gasp of shock and recognition and<br/>took on a resigned look.<p>"You know what he's talking about, Bell?" Keiichi<br/>asked.<p>"Saffron is a god that went rogue and became a<br/>dictator of a small midgard country," Belldandy<br/>explained. "He was defeated and forced into a new<br/>incarnation by a human named Ranma Saotome, almost<br/>five years ago. He was torn limb from limb in fact."<p>~This guy tore a god limb from limb,~ Keiichi<br/>swallowed nervously but placed himself firmly between<br/>Ranma and Belldandy. Ranma smirked, and Akane rolled<br/>her eyes. Both seemed to approve of the motion<br/>though.<p>"The jerk almost let Akane die anyway," Ranma said.<br/>"Can we get past the introductions without a fight?"<p>"We're just hoping you know something about how to<br/>help Ranko," Akane said.<p>"Certainly," Belldandy said. "Keiichi, it's fine.<br/>Saffron was a rogue, almost as bad as a demon."<p>"Are you sure?" Keiichi asked.<p>"As if we'd threaten anyone that seems so much like<br/>Kasumi," Ranma said.<p>"They don't know who Kasumi is, Baka," Akane reminded<br/>him. Belldandy smiled at the affection in the<br/>apparent insult.<p>"Well, we don't have any more classes," Keiichi said.<p>"I'll talk to her if you like," Belldandy said.<p>"She's gonna be at this restaurant that belongs to a<br/>friend of ours," Akane said. "Would you join us for<br/>lunch?"<p>"That would be nice," Belldandy said, completely<br/>relaxed. There was certainly no hostile intent coming<br/>from these two. "So, Ranma-san, how old is your<br/>daughter?"<p>"Four or twenty" Ranma said. "We're not sure which<br/>it should be." Belldandy and Keiichi stared at him<br/>for a moment.<p>"It's a long story," Ranma and Akane said together.<p>******<p>Mara yawned and stretched, fed up with pacing the<br/>room and thinking of a new plan to split up Belldandy<br/>and Keiichi. She popped a couple joints and sat down<br/>at her computer. Pulling it up she happily noted a<br/>string of new messages.<p>"All right! Post up!" she called out. After<br/>finishing with the game stuff she got to Wldchld14's<br/>response to her private mail. It had a new subject<br/>header, none of her text was there, and it was sent to<br/>all six of them.<p>The council says that even if I was strong enough to<br/>take the trials, that I ain't really a person so no go<br/>either way.<p>There was already a reply up, and Guncat was as<br/>succinct as ever.<p>That sucks.<p>"What's she doing up?" Mara asked as she sent out her<br/>condolences, and a thinly veiled offer to bring about<br/>some retribution. Then it was time for work again,<br/>she sighed irritably. She was really beginning to<br/>hate her job.<p>As soon as she disconnected the computer her phone<br/>started ringing. Mara sweatdropped and hesitantly<br/>picked up the phone.<p>"Hello?" she said hoarsely.<p>The next thing she knew was that her ear drums were<br/>being blasted out as some greater demon went about<br/>lecturing her about tying up the phone lines. Then<br/>the assignment came, no she wasn't being reassigned.<br/>This new one could actually help her first one.<p>"You want me to convert a goddess?" she said<br/>uncertainly. "I already know her?"<p>Her computer started spontaneously printing out a<br/>file, sending the pages flying about the room, as her<br/>superior continued to shout in her ear. After she was<br/>allowed to leave she collected the scattered sheets of<br/>paper and tried to arrange them in proper order.<p>"Wild child is a goddess!" she screeched. She<br/>swallowed nervously and sat back down at her computer.<br/>It was like with her sister all over again. The<br/>bosses wouldn't allow her any friendships it seemed.<p>She hesitated before starting to send another mail.<p>Hey, why don't we meet...<p>******<p>Skuld turned the corner and looked up and down the<br/>street for any sign of the redhead. It was like the<br/>goddess had just vanished, but Skuld's goggles hadn't<br/>registered a teleport, or a spell or anything like<br/>that.<p>"Ahh, nuts!" Skuld said. Then someone leaned on her<br/>shoulders from behind.<p>"What's your deal, kid?" a voice asked. Skuld<br/>laughed nervously and turned to see the redhead's<br/>elbow on her shoulder, with the other goddess's chin<br/>cupped in her hand.<p>"How'd you do that?" Skuld asked. "I didn't get any<br/>readings on any sort of spell." The redhead arched an<br/>eyebrow and pointed to a shallow alcove just around<br/>the corner.<p>"Now, why are you following me," the girl asked.<p>"Ummm..." Skuld blushed nervously and muttered<br/>something.<p>"What?"<p>"I was bored, okay?" Skuld said. "And I was<br/>wondering what you three were doing here."<p>"Three...?" the girl frowned and then nodded as she<br/>figured it out. "You mean Ranma and Akane, right?"<p>"Your father and that valkyrie, and you," Skuld<br/>nodded. She firmed up her courage. After all, she<br/>was thousands upon thousands of years old. Even if<br/>she wouldn't remember most of that time until sometime<br/>after she finished growing in her current incarnation.<br/>"Now what are you doing here?"<p>"Akane's a valkyrie?" the girl blinked.<p>"Yes," Skuld said uncertainly. "And your father's an<br/>einherjar." The strange goddess's eyes narrowed.<p>"Those better not be insults," she said. Skuld<br/>tipped over and planted her face in the ground.<p>"What kind of goddess are you!" Skuld demanded,<br/>putting herself right in the other's face.<p>"Goddess?" the girl said. She blinked and then<br/>gasped as if she suddenly noticed something. "Hey,<br/>you got marks on your face just like mine." Skuld<br/>held out her hands, fingers, mouth and eye twitching.<p>******<p>"Welcome to Ucchans," the woman behind the counter<br/>said. "Oh, hi, Ranko-chan, who's your friend?" Ranko<br/>shrugged as Ukyou narrowed her eyes at the<br/>similarities between the two girl's life forces.<p>"Hey, Ukyou," Ranko said, then looked to Skuld.<br/>"This is Skuld, she's a little crazy, but she thinks<br/>I'm a goddess so she can't be all that bad."<p>"I am not crazy!" Skuld insisted angrily.<p>"Well, you got Ranma's ego," Ukyou said jokingly.<br/>"That's for sure." Ranko groaned as she sat on the<br/>stool and put her head down on the counter.<p>"Hey," Skuld said.<p>"You always say that," Ranko muttered. She picked<br/>her head up and looked around. "Ryouga's lost again?"<p>"You got it kiddo," Ukyou said. "Since this morning.<br/>Interested in babysitting?"<p>"Did you hear me?" Skuld demanded. "I said that I'm<br/>not crazy."<p>"I didn't say you were," Ukyou said. Ranko gave her<br/>a look.<p>"Come on," she said. "You don't believe her do you?"<p>"It's true!" Skuld insisted.<p>"Stranger things have happened," Ukyou shrugged.<p>"The Amazons called me an 'object'," Ranko reminded<br/>her. "I can't even channel enough chi, or whatever,<br/>to shatter a brick any more."<p>"You're a little too hard on yourself," Ukyou said,<br/>shaking her head.<p>"That's what everybody else says," Ranko muttered.<br/>Ukyou sighed and turned to Skuld.<p>"If Ranko's a goddess," she said. "I suppose that<br/>makes you one too?"<p>"That's right," Skuld said, nodding proudly. Then<br/>clamped her mouth shut. "But I'm not supposed to tell<br/>anyone, da...rn it." Ukyou smirked.<p>"Ukyou, I'm going to use your computer," Ranko said.<br/>"Okay?"<p>"Sure kiddo," Ukyou said. "What do you want on your<br/>okonomiyaki."<p>"I'll wait for Ranma and Akane to get here," the<br/>redhead said, disappearing into the back.<p>"How about you?" Ukyou asked. "What can I get her<br/>holiness?"<p>"Do you have any ice cream?" Skuld asked. I few<br/>seconds later Skuld was looking at the first ice cream<br/>okonomiyaki she had ever seen.<p>"It's an okonomiyaki shaped sundae," Ukyou said.<br/>"Cool huh?" Skuld sweatdropped.<p>******<p>Keiichi had quite rightly concluded that the two<br/>people walking next to him and Belldandy had a<br/>weirdness factor that challenged even his day to day<br/>life. What really made him twitch was how calmly they<br/>explained Ranko's "birth."<p>"So she's like a clone then?" Keiichi asked,<br/>remembering with a shiver the trouble they had with<br/>two Urds running around.<p>"No, the twin water allows for the creation of a<br/>whole new person," Belldandy explained. "The fact<br/>that she has..."<p>Belldandy paused, uncertain of whether or not to pass<br/>this information along or not. The two of them would<br/>eventually be called to heaven as well, immortals were<br/>not supposed to run around Earth without a reason.<br/>Still...<p>"The fact that she changed proves she has her own<br/>soul," Belldandy said.<p>"We know she's got a soul," Ranma said. "And don't<br/>tell her she's some sort of copy either."<p>"He didn't mean anything by it, Ranma," Akane said.<p>"Yeah, I know," Ranma said. "It's the ones that<br/>don't do it on purpose that are the worse though, you<br/>know?" Akane nodded in agreement, considering her own<br/>reaction whenever someone insulted her without even<br/>realizing it.<p>"We'll be sure to take care of how we treat her,"<br/>Belldandy assured them.<p>~Sort of daughter, my foot,~ Keiichi thought. ~This<br/>guy's really protective of her.~ "How did she...get<br/>her marks anyway?" Belldandy turned to the two<br/>martial artists at Keiichi's question, curious about<br/>that herself.<p>"She was...sick," Akane said hesitantly. "Someone<br/>tried to get at us through her and she ended up<br/>poisoned. The only cure that we were told would work<br/>was fruit from the holy peach tree."<p>"She got the marks while she was eating the peach we<br/>got," Ranma said. Belldandy blinked in surprise and<br/>then smiled sunnily.<p>"I'm quite impressed," she said. "Not many people<br/>would acquire that prize just to give it to someone<br/>else."<p>"What would we use it for?" Ranma asked seriously.<p>"Eternal life," Belldandy said simply. Ranma and<br/>Akane grimaced.<p>"I think we got that anyway," Akane said, somewhat<br/>sadly.<p>"Don't be too sad," Belldandy said. "Things will<br/>work out in time." ~You and your children will live<br/>forever among the heros of heaven and their children,<br/>I'm just not sure if you're ready to here that yet.~<p>They looked forward to the Ucchan's sign showing<br/>through the rainbow of store flags and signs.<p>******<p>"Guncat's still up?" Ranko said, surprised. "There's<br/>soulsword, what's she gonna do?"<p>Predictably enough, soulsword's sidhe was making some<br/>sort of speech before she, too descended on the<br/>ghouls, sword swinging. Neobomb and Bloodletter's<br/>characters were handling the infiltration end<br/>apparently.<p>Ranko smirked.<p>"That vampire must absolutely hate being out of the<br/>fight," she snickered. She glanced on down and found<br/>messages from Guncat, Bloodletter and soulsword<br/>regarding her status as a citizen. Then there was<br/>Bloodletter's mail asking to meet.<p>Meet? Like when and where?<p>She sent the message and was surprised to receive an<br/>answer only a few moments later.<p>How's now? Nerima park? Ranko considered that for a<br/>moment and then shrugged. She had nothing better to<br/>do.<p>After sending her confirmation she started to walk out<br/>toward the street, and stopped herself. If she left<br/>that way, Skuld would follow her. She glanced at the<br/>rear window and nodded. She wrote up a quick note and<br/>pasted it to the computer monitor before slipping out<br/>the back. Then she was off to meet this woman that<br/>complained about her job so much.<p>******<p>"Damn rental," Rally muttered as she kicked the car<br/>and got out to walk.<p>"So what are we still doing in Japan, huh?" May asked<br/>next to her. Rally walked up to a pay phone and set<br/>up her lap top again. "How long is it before you get<br/>picked up for that gun?"<p>"You're the one with explosives to level a mountain,"<br/>Rally said as she called up her email account again.<br/>She immediately smiled in triumph. "All right, Becky.<br/>Thank you."<p>"Okay, so what are we here for?" May asked again.<br/>"We already got the creep handed over to US Embassy,<br/>the bounty is only a little more than our expenses.<br/>What are we doing? Another bounty?"<p>"Nope," Rally said. "I'm going to surprise some<br/>friends."<p>"You have friends in Japan?" May asked, surprised.<p>"Yep, and Becky just intercepted some mail for me<br/>that says where two of them are going to be in a<br/>little bit," she said proudly. She slipped her lap<br/>top back into the shoulder bag and started walking<br/>down the street.<p>"Aren't we going to take the car?" May asked,<br/>pointing. Rally grimaced and glanced over her<br/>shoulder.<p>"That piece of crap?" she demanded, shaking her head.<br/>"Walking's faster."<p>******<p>Ranko was starting to tire by the time she reached<br/>the park and sat down at a bench to wait for her<br/>friend to show up. It would be nice to have another<br/>friend. Maybe, if she got enough friends, she'd be<br/>able to make her own tribe. Some place she fit in<br/>like she didn't in Japan or Joketsuzoku.<p>It didn't take long for boredom to over take her and<br/>she started doing katas while she waited. She moved<br/>smoothly, form perfect, but without any really power.<br/>She could handle a few street thugs, maybe an average<br/>black belt. Beyond that, she just couldn't guess.<p>She was interrupted in her activities by the sight of<br/>a little boy wandering around by himself. She frowned<br/>and looked across the park. The playscape was way on<br/>the other side, out of sight from here. Unless the<br/>kid's parents were with him she didn't see why he was<br/>over here. Somehow she got the feeling that the kids<br/>parents definitely didn't know where he was.<p>"Hey kid," she said, walking over and bending down to<br/>his eye level. She didn't have to bend far. "You<br/>lost or something?" The kid shook his head. "So<br/>where are your mommy and daddy?" She had a sudden<br/>flash of a young couple frantically searching the park<br/>for this kid. He pointed back towards the playscape.<br/>"So why don't you go back to them? I'm sure they're<br/>worried aboutcha."<p>"No they're not," he said. "They're mean." Ranko<br/>smirked and quirked an eyebrow.<p>"So what do they do that's mean?" she asked.<p>"They won't let me play on the big slide," he said.<p>"The big slide's a little tall for you," Ranko said<br/>soothingly. "I think maybe they're just worried<br/>you'll hurt yourself."<p>"But I'm a big kid now," he insisted.<p>"Ok," she said. "But the big slides for a very big<br/>kid." The boy probably couldn't even get up the<br/>ladder that was made for that slide.<p>"I'm a very big kid," he insisted petulantly.<br/>"They're just being mean."<p>"That's their job," Ranko said. "They're supposed to<br/>watch out for you."<p>"I can watch out for myself," he snapped. Ranko<br/>sighed, she liked kids. For some reason she couldn't<br/>lay a finger on she was usually fairly good with them.<br/>Sometimes she flubbed it though.<p>"I'm sure you can," she said soothingly. "But you<br/>gotta humor your mom and dad. Parents get kind of<br/>paranoid, always afraid somethin' bad was going to<br/>happen you know? So you got to put up with it until<br/>you're old enough to get your own place. And you know<br/>what?"<p>"What?" he asked.<p>"Then you get to tell your own kids what to do," she<br/>said conspiratorially.<p>"Sota!" someone called out. It wasn't a parent,<br/>sounded like a young girl actually. Well, Ranko had<br/>expected someone to come by soon. "Sota, where are<br/>you. Mom and grandpa are worried sick about you!"<p>"I'm over here!" the boy called out. A girl came<br/>stomping into view and walked up to Ranko and Sota,<br/>cautiously watching Ranko. "I was just talking to<br/>this girl, Kagome."<p>"I'm sorry if he's being a pest, miss," the girl<br/>said. Ranko shrugged.<p>"Nah, I just thought he might be lost and decided to<br/>help out a little," she said. She stood up and got a<br/>good look at Kagome, something flashed over her senses<br/>and she flinched.<p>"Is something wrong?" the girl, she was maybe twelve.<p>"Just felt something funny is all," Ranko said. She<br/>looked closely at Kagome and then shook her head. "Do<br/>you have a pet dog by any chance?"<p>"No, just a cat," Kagome said, not noticing Ranko<br/>twitch a little. She wasn't AS nervous around cats as<br/>Ranma, but they did give her the willies at times.<br/>"Why?"<p>"Uhh...I'm allergic to dogs," she said quickly. "And<br/>I thought that funny feeling might be a reaction."<br/>She really had know idea why she asked, it just felt<br/>like the thing to do.<p>"Ohh kay," Kagome said. She started herding Sota<br/>away from the strange girl.<p>"Gotta be careful with strays you pick up, you know,"<br/>Ranko said, again for no apparent reason. "They don't<br/>like to get attached to people if they can help it."<p>"Right," Kagome said, and then she picked up Sota and<br/>was running away from Ranko. Ranko slapped herself in<br/>the forehead.<p>"What was that about?" she wondered irritably and<br/>went back to her bench to wait.<p>******<p>"Did your dream get into any specifics?" Ayako asked.<p>"Nope, I just think something big is going to happen<br/>around here," Yohko said. "Even if nothing happens,<br/>Guncat sent me a mail saying she was going to be in<br/>the country and maybe we could surprise a couple other<br/>players."<p>"Oh yes, the game. Now let me get this straight,"<br/>Ayako said, narrowing her eyes. "You do this to relax<br/>and escape reality for a little while."<p>"Right," Yohko said. "I know you have to have your<br/>own hobbies, Ayako."<p>"I'm not finished," Ayako said.<p>"Oh, okay," Yohko shrugged.<p>"Now, in this game," Ayako continued, rubbing her<br/>forehead. "You play a woman from an ancient family<br/>that uses a sword, fights monsters and demons, lives<br/>in a dream world and has bad luck with romance?"<p>"That's right," Yohko confirmed, uncertain of where<br/>she was going. "But she's an elf, or faerie, or<br/>something. Not human anyway."<p>"Whatever," Ayako said. "My only question is this.<br/>How is that an escape from your normal life?"<p>"Ummm..." Yohko struggled to come up with an answer.<br/>"I don't live in a dream world." Ayako gave her a<br/>look.<p>"Let's see if the Azusas have the luggage ready," she<br/>muttered.<p>******<p>Mara watched the scene unfold with a sense of<br/>nostalgia. Ranko might not know that she was a<br/>goddess, but she was a natural. And it was plain to<br/>see what her domain was, and why hell would want to<br/>recruit her. Mara frowned as she thought back<br/>thousands of years to a little orphan wandering the<br/>streets. Somebody offering to make her strong enough<br/>to survive if she just signed on the dotted line.<p>"If a goddess like her had been active back then,"<br/>she whispered. "They wouldn't have gotten half the<br/>recruits they did. On the other hand, a demon like<br/>her..." The thought actually disturbed Mara. She<br/>glanced at the black paper in her hand and hesitated<br/>before stuffing it in her pocket and moving to meet<br/>Ranko.<p>******<p>"Wldchld14?" someone asked behind her.<p>Ranko turned to the sound of the voice and saw a woman<br/>in her early twenties standing there with a lopsided<br/>grin. The red marks on the woman's face gave her a<br/>sense of unease for some reason, but she ignored it.<br/>She had her own marks. What did someone else's<br/>matter.<p>"Bloodletter?" she asked in response.<p>"It's Mara actually," the woman said with a smile as<br/>she sat down next to Ranko. "What's your name?"<p>"Saotome Ranko," she said pleasantly, bowing at the<br/>waist.<p>"You're younger than I expected," Mara said.<p>"I don't look my age," Ranko said simply. Mara<br/>leaned over with a smile.<p>"Oh, older than you look I guess?" she asked.<p>Mara noted, with a sort of satisfaction, that Ranko's<br/>eyes diverted to her chest for a moment. She couldn't<br/>really tell what the goddess's preferences were, but<br/>it didn't really matter to her. Mara had been<br/>practicing her trade for centuries, anybody mortal<br/>would fall to her eventually. And for the moment,<br/>Ranko wasn't much more than mortal herself.<p>"So what did you want to talk about?" Ranko asked<br/>nervously.<p>"I just thought you needed a little cheering up," she<br/>said softly, wrapping her arms around Ranko's<br/>shoulder. "What with the way those old hens were<br/>treating you, just because of a little mixed blood."<br/>Ranko had let them assume that particular idea, not<br/>telling them directly, but not correcting them either.<p>"Hey!" Ranko snapped, standing up away from Mara in<br/>surprise and a little anger. "Watch it. I like you<br/>and all but, I ain't like that." There was a little<br/>uncertainty in her voice though. Mara smiled<br/>internally, keeping up that no-mind concentration that<br/>allowed her to ignore the consequences of her actins.<p>~She doesn't know for sure then?~ Mara thought, and<br/>imagined the fun she could convince this girl to<br/>engage in. And some point, while Ranko was distracted<br/>by the pleasures, ask her the question and of course<br/>she would say yes. Then they could truly be friends<br/>forever.<p>And then Mara's former unease cracked through the<br/>layer of ignorance she had constructed for herself.<p>Mara flinched and shook her head clear. They<br/>wouldn't be friends after that. Mara certainly held<br/>no affection for the demon that tricked her. Ranko<br/>would just be an ex-lover that Mara had tricked into<br/>condemning herself for eternity. And if it got out to<br/>Urd that she had tricked a fledgling goddess into<br/>changing sides. Well, all her friends would be gone.<p>"Are you okay, Blood?" Ranko asked as the woman's<br/>expression changed from a lusting one, to one of<br/>remorse.<p>"I can't do it," Mara said. She took a black sheet<br/>of paper out of her pocket.<p>"Can't do what?" Ranko asked nervously.<p>"See these marks, Ranko," Mara said. "They mean I'm<br/>a demon."<p>"Okay," Ranko said, getting hesitantly into stance.<br/>If the woman was telling the truth, she'd have no<br/>chance in a fight, but she would go down fighting<br/>anyway. Mara wasn't paying attention to her, merely<br/>looking at the paper in her hand.<p>"I was supposed to get you to sign this and become one<br/>of us before you figured out what you were," Mara<br/>explained. "I guess then they'd have you corrupting<br/>children throughout the rest of eternity. You're a<br/>natural with kids. I saw that." Ranko swallowed<br/>nervously at the thought, somewhat sickened.<p>"This is a joke, right," she asked. Mara shook her<br/>head and started folding the paper in her hands.<p>"Nope, as a goddess you'd be a real detriment to my<br/>bosses," she explained. "But as a demon, oh the<br/>damage someone like you could do. But I'm not going<br/>to do it. I'm tired of getting assigned to destroy my<br/>friends."<p>She tore the paper in her hand, and then tore it again<br/>and again. Then demon tossed up the papers and<br/>watched them burst into flames as the wind picked them<br/>up.<p>"That's that," Mara said resignedly as Ranko looked<br/>on at her, surprised. The area was quiet for the<br/>space of half a minute before three whirlwinds<br/>appeared in the area around them, coalescing into<br/>three humanoid male beings.<p>"Mara, demon first class," one of the figures, a<br/>reddish man with the same sharp teeth that Mara had.<br/>"You are accused of high treason, I'm taking you in<br/>now." Mara nodded meekly.<p>******<p>The sound of the bell brought Skuld's attention to<br/>the door, and she almost fell off her stool in<br/>surprise. She was having an uncomfortable time with<br/>getting shocked today.<p>"Skuld-chan!" Belldandy said with a little reproach.<br/>"There you are!"<p>"Oneesama," she said loudly. "How did you meet<br/>them!"<p>"You know them Skuld?" Keiichi asked.<p>"She came in with Ranko today," Ukyou said from<br/>behind the counter. "She's been telling me about how<br/>Ranko's a goddess." It was only half a joke. Keiichi<br/>slapped his hand into his face, while Skuld blushed<br/>and laughed nervously.<p>"God...dess?" Ranma said in surprise.<p>"Oh dear," Belldandy said. "I was hoping to break<br/>that to you a little more gently."<p>"You mean it's true?" Ukyou asked, blinking.<br/>Belldandy nodded reluctantly. Three thumps were heard<br/>shortly thereafter.<p>"Oh my," Belldandy said. "They didn't take that very<br/>well."<p>******<p>"Hey! Don't just stand there," Ranko shouted.<br/>"Fight 'em!" The lead demon glanced at her and then<br/>the other two demons.<p>"Seal the goddess," he said. "But don't kill her, we<br/>don't know who her double is." Ranko winced and<br/>returned to her stance. Mara whipped to her feet and<br/>released a wave of dark fire into one of the two<br/>subordinate demons.<p>"Yeah!" Ranko cheered on. She chunked a rock at the<br/>other minor demon. She was pleased to see it smack<br/>the demon on the back of the head and send him<br/>sprawling to the ground. Someone else without access<br/>to any magic also felt heartened by the sight.<p>"Run!" the demoness ordered her as she prepared to<br/>strike out again.<p>"By order of the Lord of Lies," the leader snapped.<br/>"Your power is revoked!" Mara's next attack fizzled<br/>into nothing before she could even completely form it<br/>and the demon collapsed to the ground, exhausted.<p>"I ain't leaving you to them," Ranko shouted.<p>The head demon was about to respond when the scene was<br/>bathed in sudden blinding light. Ranko squinted her<br/>eyes shut and could only listen at the barrage of<br/>gunshots that followed immediately after the flash.<br/>When the flash died down, a tanned woman wearing<br/>sunglasses stood next to a panting Mara. A small gun<br/>was held in her hand as she scanned the scene. The<br/>three demons were down on the ground, each with two<br/>gaping wounds in their skulls.<p>"Who the-?" Mara gasped.<p>"Rally Vincent," the woman said cheerfully. "Bounty<br/>hunter, owner and operator of Gunsmith Cats." Her<br/>Japanese wasn't bad, but it definitely had a strong<br/>American accent. A blonde, who looked younger than<br/>Ranko did, came out from behind some trees and kicked<br/>at the demon bodies, muttering something in English.<br/>Rally glanced at one of the dead demons and continued<br/>an amused tone of voice. "and demon slayer."<p>"Gunsmith Cats," Ranko repeated. "Guncat?" Rally<br/>nodded with a smirk.<p>"I was in Japan on business," she said. "That's my<br/>partner over there, Minnie May." The blonde waved a<br/>little nervously.<p>"How the hell did you do that?" Mara asked, out of<br/>breath. Rally ignored the question.<p>"These are demons, eh?" she said. "They didn't seem<br/>too tough." Mara panted and climbed to a seat on the<br/>bench. The bodies were starting to fade away already.<p>"How'd you find us?" Ranko demanded, catching her<br/>breath from the near disaster.<p>"A friend of mine intercepted the emails. No<br/>offense," Rally said. "I think I prefer the game to<br/>this." Mara and Ranko nodded whole-heartedly. She<br/>glanced at Mara suspiciously for a moment and then<br/>shrugged it off as the demon continued to recover.<p>"You know," Mara said. "They usually don't send<br/>minions out to get traitors. They usually jus-" Mara<br/>vanished in a whirlwind of smoke.<p>******<p>"Phew, they almost got away," Washu said. She turned<br/>to look back at the man in her lab. It pleased the<br/>being to appear as a man at this point anyway.<br/>"Thanks for the warning, it would be a pity to<br/>interrupt my game."<p>"I thought you might say that," the figure said,<br/>smiling. "You know that you can't directly<br/>interfere."<p>"If I directly interfered," Washu said, smirking.<br/>"Mara wouldn't have left Earth."<p>"What do you call catching her in a pocket<br/>dimension?" the man asked. "Out of curiousity."<p>"Field testing my equipment," Washu said simply. "I<br/>can pay them a visit, I see you've got them all going<br/>to one place already. Been planning this?"<p>"It's hard to plan for free will," he said, without<br/>denying it.<p>"Uh huh," Washu said. "Anyway, I can pay them a<br/>visit, provide some technical support. And I don't<br/>think Ryoko would begrudge her mother a favor.<br/>Especially if her daughter is already going, ne,<br/>Minagi-chan?" She turned her attention to a rather<br/>cheerful looking version of Ryoko, almost identical<br/>aside from the clothes and the sickle marks on her<br/>cheeks.<p>"Hai," Minagi said.<p>******<p>"Damn it," Ranma said quietly, staring at where Mara<br/>had been. "I messed up again." The blonde was<br/>wafting away the smoke and crinkling her nose. She<br/>glanced to Rally and said something in English looking<br/>somewhat anxious. Rally responded in the same<br/>language and turned to Ranko.<p>"Doesn't look like there was anything you could do<br/>just then," she said comfortingly.<p>"Yes there is," Ranko insisted. "I'll bet Ranma or<br/>Akane would know something. And maybe we can get to<br/>Nabiki!" She started back toward Ucchan's.<p>"Hey, wait," Rally called out, holstering her woman<br/>and running to catch up to Ranko. Minnie May came up<br/>running up behind Rally shouting in English about how<br/>this was beginning to sound like a really bad idea.<br/>"Who're Ranma, Akane and Nabiki?"<p>"They're my family," Ranko said.<p>******<p>Ranma groaned as he sat up and then saw Akane coming<br/>to as well. From the sound of it Ukyou was recovering<br/>as well. Ranma took a moment to consider what he had<br/>just heard.<p>"You said Ranko was a goddess?" Ranma said.<p>"Well, duh," Skuld said.<p>"Skuld be nice," Belldandy instructed.<p>"Where is Ranko anyway?" Akane asked wearily.<p>"She went back to use the computer," Skuld said.<p>"Then why isn't she out here with all the noise we're<br/>making," Ranma asked. Ukyou, standing up, took notice<br/>of that and walked back into the office and returned<br/>with a paste it note.<p>"'Gone to meet a friend,'" Ukyou read. "'See you<br/>later.' She must have slipped out the back."<p>"How long ago did she go back there?" Ranma asked<br/>frantically.<p>"Please calm down, Saotome-san," Belldandy said.<br/>"She is a goddess, she is protected from accidents."<p>"I'm not worried about an accident," Ranma said.<br/>"I'm worried about some pervert trying to get the best<br/>of her. We told you she don't know how ta use<br/>her...mana?...she's just a normal kid without that."<p>"Why didn't you teach her how to?" Skuld demanded.<br/>Ranma and Akane fixed her with a look and Skuld had<br/>the good grace to look embarrassed.<p>"Chi is not the same," Belldandy said. "It requires<br/>different forms of focus to use."<p>"You're saying that she's been a goddess for four<br/>years and hasn't learned how to do anything in that<br/>time?" Keiichi asked, surprised. "I thought it came<br/>natural."<p>"It takes hard work you doofus," Skuld snapped.<br/>~That's why the most I can do without machines is<br/>paste words all over people.~<p>"RAAANNMA! AKAANEEE!" a voice shouted as the door<br/>was slammed open. Ranko paused for a moment at the<br/>sight of the two strangers, and Skuld, then rushed for<br/>Ranma and Akane. "I've screwed up! I just stood<br/>there and let them take her!"<p>"Let who take who?" Akane asked. Eyes turned to the<br/>two people coming in to the restaurant behind Ranko.<br/>Akane's eyes narrowed dangerously as she saw the<br/>holstered gun, and in a flash she was across the room.<p>"Whoa!" the woman shouted. Her partner produced a<br/>grenade and a determined expression as she shouted in<br/>English. "Hey, hey. I'm a friend!" She turned to<br/>the blonde and said something to her. The blonde<br/>reluctantly put away her grenade.<p>"Everybody, let's calm down," Belldandy said.<br/>"Akane-san, Miss...Ranko-san, please. Can you just<br/>tell us what's wrong?"<p>"Don't go for the gun," Akane warned as she let the<br/>American down.<p>"Don't worry about me," she said, dusting herself,<br/>but maintaining a slightly superior look on her face.<br/>Something that said Akane wasn't going to get the drop<br/>on her again. It was a bluff though, and both knew<br/>it. "Good moves."<p>"Okay," Ranma snapped. "What's going on?"<p>"You know that game I play on the computer?" Ranko<br/>asked. Ranma nodded. "I went to go meet Bloodletter,<br/>she's from the gam-" Skuld fell off her stool and<br/>sprang up, investigating Ranko's T-Shirt.<p>"You're Wild Child!" she gasped. "I'm Neobomb."<br/>Skuld blinked as the American extended a hand with a<br/>smirk.<p>"Guncat, how are you doing?" she said with a smirk.<br/>Skuld blinked a couple times and nearly fainted.<br/>"Introductions done? Okay. Because our mutual friend<br/>Bloodletter just vanished in a puff of smoke." She<br/>turned to Ranma and Akane. "Ranko seems to think you<br/>might be able to find a way to get her back."<p>~I need to learn Japanese,~ Minnie May thought<br/>irritably as she watched them talk.<p>"Huh, what happened?" Skuld asked. Ranko gave a<br/>quick rundown of the events at the park. Skuld was<br/>twitching throughout most of it. "Bloodletter, is<br/>Mara...that actually makes sense."<p>"I'm sorry, Ranko-chan," Belldandy said sadly. "If<br/>Mara was taken back to Nifelheim, there is nothing you<br/>can do."<p>"Well," a new voice added. "It's a good thing she's<br/>not in Nifelheim then." No one was quite certain when<br/>the little girl had appeared there, but it was quite<br/>obvious that she was more than she appeared to be.<p>"Who are you?" Ranma asked, noting her aura, similar<br/>to the goddesses' but slightly different.<p>"Excuse me," the comer addressed Rally. "Can I see<br/>your gun for a moment, I'd like to see how you killed<br/>three demons with such a weapon."<p>"I wasn't supposed to?" Rally asked, hesitantly<br/>handing over the weapon. It would be good to just why<br/>she had succeeded in case she had to fight a demon<br/>again sometime.<p>"Ceramic gun," the pink-haired woman said. "You made<br/>it?" Rally nodded. "Impressive. Ahh, crystal<br/>bullets, that explains it. Must limit the size of the<br/>gun though."<p>"Yeah," Rally agreed, accepting the weapon back and<br/>holstering it. "It's a smaller gun than I like, but<br/>neither the gun nor the ammunition register on metal<br/>detectors. Shatters in a nasty pattern when it hits,<br/>virtually any armor will stop it, but it has lots of<br/>stopping power and causes some heavy injuries."<p>"You'll need something bigger for what you're about<br/>to do," she said. "More rapid fire too, I can give<br/>you that." Rally felt somewhat vaguely nervous about<br/>that statement.<p>"Hey!" Ranko snapped. "We asked who you were?"<p>"Watch it Wild," the woman said, smirking. "I'll<br/>give Burns-the-Panda fleas." The three game players<br/>blinked in surprise.<p>"Washu-sama," Belldandy said blinking. "I thought<br/>you were trapped."<p>"One of my daughter's little friends broke the seal,"<br/>Washu said. "Now, about, Mara. You know the rules as<br/>well as I. I can't use my power directly to<br/>interfere, however, I can use my inventions. So you<br/>see, Mara is not in Nifelheim. She is in a pocket<br/>dimension I created to hold her for a little bit."<p>"So why not just take her all the way back?" Ranma<br/>asked.<p>"Because, she IS a demon," Washu said. She sat down<br/>at a stool and looked at a shell-shocked Ukyou.<br/>"Don't worry dear, it's just a silly, over-complicated<br/>crossover. Now can you get me an okonomiyaki and I<br/>can get on to explaining the situation."<p>"Uh, sure," Ukyou said.<p>"If you can drag her physically back here," Washu<br/>said. "I'm sure something can be done to safeguard<br/>her. But eventually her master will pull her back<br/>otherwise."<p>"So, all we do is go there and bring her back?" Rally<br/>asked. "Sounds too easy."<p>"Good food," Washu said. "I'm pretty certain that<br/>the demons are already trying to get her themselves.<br/>But I left a security system to hold them off,<br/>unfortunately, I was rushed. So it'll try to hold<br/>everyone off."<p>"What kind of security system?" Skuld asked,<br/>remembering some past adventures.<p>"Ever play this game called Quake?" Washu asked.<br/>Rally and Skuld groaned. "Don't worry, there's help<br/>coming."<p>"Like who?" Akane asked. The doorbell rang as the<br/>door was opened to admit two sets of twins.<p>"Wow, it looks like a party," one of the older sets<br/>of twins said. She spotted Rally and waved. "Hey,<br/>Guncat, its me, Soulsword."<p>"Uh...you might want to hold off," Rally said. "We<br/>got some serious trouble coming."<p>"No, they can be helpful," Belldandy said, she<br/>glanced to Skuld and the two elder Saotomes for<br/>confirmation. They all nodded in confirmation.<p>"Is something wrong?" Ayako asked grimly, narrowing<br/>her eyes. After the situation was explained she<br/>looked around at the people as if they were insane.<br/>"You want us to risk our lives to rescue a demon?<br/>Okay...that sounds about normal."<p>"Your sarcasm is noted, cousin," Yohko said dryly.<br/>Minnie May stopped doing the tennis neck thing for a<br/>moment and yawned.<p>"That wasn't the help I was talking about," Washu<br/>said. A silver haired woman appeared next to Washu<br/>and started glaring.<p>"She isn't my daughter any more than you're my<br/>mother!" the woman snapped. "And what the hell are<br/>you doing getting her mixed up in some sort of<br/>interdimensional rescue mission anyway? She's an<br/>airhead, she'll just mess up and get herself hurt.<br/>And I...Sasami wouldn't like that."<p>"Everybody, my daughter Ryoko," Washu said. "Ryoko,<br/>everybody."<p>"Hello," Ryoko said gruffly. Then she turned back to<br/>Washu. "There is nothing you can say to get me to..."<p>"I'll stop teasing Tenchi for a month," Washu said.<br/>Ryoko froze.<p>"Two months," she said. "And you got a deal."<p>"I knew I could count on you," Washu said, smirking.<br/>Another woman, almost a carbon copy of Ryoko suddenly<br/>appeared next to Ryoko.<p>"Are we ready to go?" she asked cheerfully.<p>And various characters in the rumor commented, but<br/>there were now too many people in the scene for the<br/>author to keep track of...well actually...that had<br/>happened a while ago.<p>******
