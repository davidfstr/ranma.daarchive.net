</div>=====================<p>Metuo Palam Acerbus By: Taiteki Kagato<p>Disclaimer and Authors Notes posted at the bottom.<p>Warning: Graphic scenes of violence and unsettling situations ahead.<br/>Read at your own discretion.<p>=====================<p>Akane Tendo looked around her room, attempting to memorize every aspect<br/>of it. Quietly, she reacquainted herself with the overlooked, the under-<br/>used, the plain and ordinary.<p>Sitting down on her bed, she ran her hand along the comforter, letting<br/>the texture imprint itself in her mind as it had done when it was new,<br/>before years of sleeping under it had rendered the memory inappreciable.<p>As she moved over to her desk, Akane picked up a photograph of her and<br/>her sisters, in which the three of them were smiling happily before the<br/>camera. Ignoring the blurring of her vision, she reached out to trace<br/>the lines of Kasumi's face, before staring at Nabiki; Nabiki, who would<br/>soon be an only child.<p>Replacing the photo, Akane left her room to rejoin Ukyo, Nabiki, and<br/>Ranma in the hallway. The three stopped talking when she approached, and<br/>she shuddered as she saw the mixture of fear and sorrow in their eyes.<br/>To them, she was already as good as dead, and the worst thing was, aside<br/>from a sore throat, she didn't feel bad at all. Truth be told, she felt<br/>better than fine; colors were brighter, sounds were richer, everything<br/>was almost too good to be true. When Kasumi had collapsed, then birthed<br/>that "thing," Akane realized just how untrue everything was.<p>"So, have you decided?" Akane asked flatly.<p>"God, I can not believe we're having this conversation," Ranma muttered,<br/>echoing everyone else's thoughts on the nightmareish conversation they<br/>knew they were about to have.<p>Ukyo stared at the floor, while Nabiki kept shifting her gaze from one<br/>spot on the wall to another, never looking anyone in the eye. Closing<br/>her eyes, she cleared her throat, earning her some distance from<br/>everyone else, before whispering softly.<p>"Please?"<p>The three shivered at her barely audible plea, and what it represented.<p>"There's gotta be a way to-" Ukyo started, hopefully. She was cut off<br/>before she could get anywhere.<p>"-To what? Cut it out? You want to walk into a hospital and explain this<br/>to them? You saw the police officer, Ukyo, you know what they'll do,"<br/>Nabiki snapped.<p>"Well we can't just give up!" Ranma shouted.<p>"Maybe we could-" Ukyo said frowning. Again Nabiki cut her off, this<br/>time with a sharp humorless bark of laughter.<p>"Ha! Using what, your spatulas?"<p>Ignoring the tears Nabiki had crawling down her cheek, Ukyo scowled<br/>before retorting just as loud, "well we have to do something!"<p>"Like what?"<p>"Maybe if we kill it..." Ranma said, quietly.<p>"You saw what it did to the floor when it died, Ranma," Akane said<br/>quietly.<p>Ukyo hugged herself, leaning against the wall before summing up, "what a<br/>fucking nightmare."<p>The hallway fell silent as everyone became somewhat introspective.<br/>Finally, Ranma straightened up, his eyes determined.<p>"Lets go."<p>"Go where?" Akane asked, her voice flat.<p>"To the last place you can remember," Ranma said evenly. Akane started<br/>to protest, before finally shrugging and walking down the hallway. Ukyo<br/>and Nabiki followed the two outside, the cool air still dark as low<br/>hanging clouds threatened the area with rain once again.<p>"I don't remember where I was, but I remember bits and pieces of... I...<br/>I helped Kasumi through a hole in the school..." Akane said, trailing<br/>off.<p>"Then what?" Ranma asked, still walking. When Akane didn't answer, he<br/>turned around, only to see Akane panting heavily as she leaned up<br/>against a streetlight. One hand was being used to support her, while the<br/>other covered her sternum. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead, and Ranma<br/>took an involuntary step back, before squashing his fears and moving<br/>towards her.<p>"Akane, is it...?"<p>The girl nodded once before collapsing, her eyes pinched shut. Ranma<br/>caught her and lowered her to the ground. Fumbling, her hands shaking,<br/>Akane managed to reach into her pocket and pull something out. Ranma<br/>stepped back as he realized she was holding out the revolver Nabiki had<br/>given her.<p>"Oh, god Akane, I..." he stammered, the blood pounding in his ears like<br/>war drums. Akane blinked and gazed up at him from the ground, her eyes<br/>watery and pleading. Ranma shuddered, and slowly reached out for the<br/>gun.<p>"Ra-Ranma... p-p-please..." Akane forced out between ragged breaths and<br/>gasps of pain. She could feel something moving behind her ribs, biting<br/>tentatively at the flesh it could reach. It was like nothing she'd ever<br/>felt before, excruciating and unknown.<p>Ranma watched her jerk, the tears pouring from her eyes as he took the<br/>pistol and pointed at her. Akane saw Ranma do this as if through a<br/>tunnel of pain that grew longer with each passing second. She was beyond<br/>hearing now, the blood roaring through her ears and drowning everything<br/>else out.<p>Through red flashes of pain, she saw Ranma, with his eyes closed,<br/>seeming to wordlessly mouth "I'm sorry," before she closed her eyes<br/>against the unbearable pain. Images flashed through her mind rapidly,<br/>her friends, her family, her sisters, and finally, she saw her mother,<br/>smiling, reaching out to embrace her. Akane managed to say "I love you"<br/>one last time, before the world dissolved into painless nothingness.<p>Ranma jumped as the weapon went off him his hand. Tears cascaded down<br/>his face and the gun fell from numb fingers as he collapsed, a wail of<br/>anguish escaping his lips and rocking Nerima.<p>Suddenly, Ranma stood, his battle aura bursting into existence around<br/>him. Cupping his hands together, he gathered all the emotions he was<br/>experiencing, and fired it at Akane's twitching body.<p>"Happa Risai!"<p>There was a flash of light, and a low, ominous rumble, and Ranma<br/>collapsed again, feeling the cool asphalt underneath his cheek.<p>"I love you too, Akane..." He whispered.<p>"MURDERER!" someone screamed from nearby. Peeling one eye open, he<br/>caught sight of a foot moments before his chest exploded in pain, and he<br/>felt himself go airborne.<p>"Ryouga, no!" Ranma heard Ukyo shout, moments before he landed, the<br/>rough pavement biting into his skin.<p>Ryouga was beyond listening. He'd rounded a corner on the way to the<br/>Dojo, intent on telling Akane about the weird stuff going on outside<br/>Osaka, when he'd seen something that would haunt him forever: Ranma, a<br/>respected martial artist, using a gun on a pained, crying Akane, moments<br/>before vaporizing her body with a ki-blast. Thought and rationale had<br/>left Ryouga beyond that moment.<p>Ukyo, who had been holding a crying Nabiki when Ryouga attacked, managed<br/>to get her between the two by then. "Move," Ryouga growled, taking<br/>steady, measured steps towards Ranma. Instead of complying, Ukyo pulled<br/>her battle spatula, falling into a defensive crouch.<p>"Wait, Ryouga, there's a reason Ranma did that," she implored.<p>"There is no possible explanation for what he has done. Move, Kuonji."<p>"Damn it, you idiot, Akane was already dead!"<p>Ryouga paused, then his scowl deepened, "I saw her crying. I saw the<br/>pain on her face as she cowered under him. I saw her tell him she loved<br/>him, and he shot her." Ryouga had reached Ukyo by then, and the chef<br/>suddenly found herself airborne, her head exploding in pain.<p>"And you let him kill her!" Ryouga roared, raising his foot to crush the<br/>prone Ranma. Seeing Ryouga swat Ukyo away finally forced Ranma to act.<br/>He may deserve death for what he'd done, but Ukyo hadn't done anything.<br/>Rolling away at the last minute, Ranma heard the pavement buckle under<br/>the force of Ryouga's stomp, moments before shards of asphalt pelted his<br/>backside.<p>Rolling to his feet before leaping back to put some distance between<br/>Ryouga, Ranma spared Ukyo a glance, in time to see her wipe a spot of<br/>blood from her lips. Turning back to the enraged brawler, the<br/>temperature around Ranma dropped, as he felt the rage boiling within<br/>Ryouga.<p>With an inarticulate howl of anguish, Ryouga charged, his moves quick<br/>and powerful, forcing Ranma to use more speed than usual to evade them.<br/>Finally reaching the center of the spiral, Ranma's smile died, and he<br/>threw the uppercut. "Hiryuu Shoten Ha!"<p>Ukyo had run for Nabiki when she realized what Ranma was doing, while<br/>the orphaned Tendo cried softly, unaware of the growing danger. Wrapping<br/>one arm around her, Ukyo grabbed onto the lip of a storm drain as she<br/>heard Ranma shout.<p>Feeling the winds pick up, Ukyo's grip tightened, but the howl and tug<br/>of Ranma's most devastating attack never came. Cracking her eye open,<br/>Ukyo spied Ranma staring at Ryouga, who'd fallen to his knees before<br/>him.<p>"Why?" Ryouga asked, staring up at Ranma with a vacant look in his eyes.<br/>Ranma's arms fell limply to his sides, and he stared at the ground. Ukyo<br/>walked up beside him, frowning at Ryouga before she actually saw the<br/>look of despair and anguish on his face.<p>"..." Ukyo opened her mouth to speak, but nothing she could think of to<br/>say felt right.<p>"Kasumi and Daddy are dead too," Nabiki said flatly. Ukyo's mouth<br/>snapped shut, and she and Ranma stared at the ground. Ryouga stared at<br/>the remaining Tendo in shock.<p>"What! But... How?" He finally stammered.<p>"They... Akane and Kasumi..." Nabiki's voice failed her, and she stared<br/>imploringly at Ranma and Ukyo, incapable of finishing the retelling<br/>herself.<p>"Akane..." Ranma whispered, his voice surprising Ryouga somewhat out of<br/>his depression. Before he could ask about Ranma's misery, Ukyo started,<br/>her eyes closed and her head turned to the side; unwilling to face or<br/>look at anyone or anything.<p>"Akane had something inside her... whatever it was, she and Kasumi got<br/>them somewhere, and the one inside Kasumi..." Ukyo, too, felt unable to<br/>continue, and she swallowed audibly before clenching her fist until her<br/>nails bit painfully into her palm.<p>"It burst out of Kasumi's Chest, and attacked Mr. Tendo, eating his..<br/>eating h- It.. the wound killed him, Ryouga. And Kasumi died.. it was...<br/>I can't..." Ukyo trailed off as tears poured from her eyes, and blood<br/>dripped from her fists.<p>Ryouga stared at Ukyo, unwilling to believe the story she'd just told,<br/>but disturbed by the way she'd told it. Ranma and Nabiki's grief-<br/>stricken faces and winces as Ukyo's story reached a particularly grisly<br/>part also gave Ryouga pause.<p>"So why was Akane crying? Why'd you shoot her?" Ryouga demanded,<br/>finally.<p>"Because she asked me to!" Ranma shouted, before burying his face in his<br/>hands.<p>"But-"<p>"The thing was about to pop out of her chest, Ryouga!" Nabiki said, her<br/>voice hysterical. "You weren't there. You didn't see the look on<br/>Kasumi's face... hear her screams.. I... My own sisters... And Daddy<br/>too..." Nabiki collapsed again, the tears resuming their trek down her<br/>face. Ukyo and Ranma both glared at Ryouga, before sitting down beside<br/>the crying orphan.<p>"Well... What did this thing look like?" Ryouga asked, finally.<p>"Horrible" Ukyo mumbled, rocking Nabiki as she wept. They sat there for<br/>a moment; Ranma and Ukyo helping Nabiki through the total loss of her<br/>family, while Ryouga watched then in awe.<p>Ukyo felt Ranma's rocking grind to a halt, and looked over at him, about<br/>to ask why he'd stopped. She realized he'd frozen up, his face draining<br/>of color. Following his gaze, Ukyo too seized up, as she spotted<br/>something taller than most men, and black as crude oil crawling along<br/>the wall of the building across from them, behind Ryouga.<p>Nabiki, wondering why Ukyo and Ranma had both started shivering on each<br/>side of her, looked up and gasped as she saw the creature slinking<br/>across the wall as if gravity meant nothing to it.<p>"Ryouga... turn around very slowly" Ukyo said, finally. Ryouga gave them<br/>a quizzical look before he complied, freezing up like the others had<br/>when he spied the obsidian creature.<p>Its large, tubular head twisted on an impossibly thin neck, both sitting<br/>atop a skeletal torso. Four tube-like bony appendages extended from the<br/>creatures back, and its arms and legs were likewise encased in the<br/>chitinous armored carapace. Extending beyond it was a tail easily as<br/>long as the creature itself, and shaped like a series of gradually<br/>diminishing vertebrae. Ending it was a spade-shaped bladed tip that<br/>glinted dangerously in the dim overcast morning light.<p>It stopped crawling suddenly, as if sensing their stares. Lifting its<br/>head off the wall, it turned as if to look at them, its eye-less head<br/>glinting ominously in the wan lighting.<p>"Is this...?" Ryouga managed to say, backing away slowly. Ukyo, Nabiki,<br/>and Ranma stood up slowly, backing away as slowly as Ryouga.<p>"I don't know. Maybe." Ranma said, pushing Nabiki behind him. Ryouga and<br/>Ukyo flanked him, hoping to protect Nabiki, when the creature opened its<br/>mouth to shriek at them.<p>The shrill, unearthly sound caused the group to jump as one. Then the<br/>creature sprung at them, impossibly fast, its tail propelling it off the<br/>wall like a compressed spring.<p>Ryouga and Ukyo leapt to the side, Ranma falling back atop Nabiki to<br/>protect her. He felt something slam down into his chest, hard, and<br/>coughed as the air was knocked out of him. Rolling off a dazed Nabiki,<br/>he stood up, then crouched defensively as the creature spun towards him.<p>"Hey!" Ukyo shouted, launching one of her spatulas. The creature<br/>scurried back, avoiding the flying blade, as Ukyo pulled her large<br/>spatula from its place at her back. Ryouga had spotted the red of his<br/>umbrella in an alley near where the creature had emerged from, and<br/>hurried over to it while it was occupied. At the last moment Ryouga<br/>realizes something was wrong, and he dove away as a second creature<br/>landed where he'd stood; its tail poised to impale him if he had<br/>remained crouching over his bag.<p>Leaping back onto the building it had dropped from, the second creature<br/>prepared to spring at Ryouga, before cocking its head to the side, and<br/>scurrying over the building, the tail of the thing disappearing over<br/>the edge almost before Ryouga had time to register it turning around on<br/>the wall.<p>"Where...?" Ryouga said, keeping his gaze on the buildings bordering the<br/>alley as he removed his umbrella.<p>"Hey! What are you kids doing out here? There's a curf-" the voice<br/>trailed off as the police officer it belonged to rounded the corner and<br/>saw the creature hissing at Ukyo, "-ew..."<p>Ukyo's spatula was scratched deeply, the thing's claws digging deep<br/>furrows into the metal rapidly. Finally she got a glancing blow in,<br/>knocking the creature back. The thing opened its mouth, launching a<br/>yellowish fluid at Ukyo, who hid behind her spatula, then dropped it as<br/>a couple droplets of the fluid flew through the gashes and landed on her<br/>arm.<p>Smoke and vapors rose from the melted spatula, and Ukyo backed away<br/>quickly, squeezing her arm above the acid burns, unable to do anything<br/>other than groan through clenched teeth as she felt the fluid<br/>liquidating the tissue around it.<p>The officer stared in shock at the fight, pulling his baton and his<br/>walky-talky slowly. Before he could radio for backup, however, he heard<br/>something hard strike the cement behind him. Spinning quickly, he looked<br/>up into a dark mouth, silver teeth opening as viscous gelled drool oozed<br/>around the lethal metallic fangs.<p>The baton fell from his fingertips as the officer whimpered, and Ryouga,<br/>who had seen the creature descend behind him, screamed for the man to<br/>move. Unable to do anything more than stare up at the metallic teeth, he<br/>watched with dread as they trembled, and suddenly something flashed out-<p>Ryouga felt bile rise in the back of his throat when he heard the wet<br/>pop of the creature ramming something through the officer's forehead.<br/>Before the body could collapse, the creature grabbed the head, tearing<br/>it from the neck with a sickening wet sound, before probing the hole it<br/>had created almost tentatively with that odd inner-mouth. Realizing it<br/>was eating the man's brains, Ryouga lost it, hunching over as his<br/>breakfast spilled across the street.<p>Ranma weaved back away from the first creature as it hissed and spat at<br/>him, like some demented caricature of his worst nightmare. He was slowly<br/>leading it away from Nabiki and Ukyo, who were trying to withdraw from<br/>the fight safely. Sparing them a glance, Ranma was knocked off his feet<br/>as the creature's tail came around and slapped against him.<p>Climbing to his feet, Ranma felt where the tail had impacted; thankful<br/>it had only bruised his ribs and not broken them. The thing may not have<br/>tactics or fight like a martial artist, but its beyond-feral ferocity<br/>and ungodly speed made up for most of what it lacked in overall skill.<p>Something glinted in the dim lighting, and Ranma spotted one of Ukyo's<br/>throwing spatulas lying in the grass where it had fallen earlier. Making<br/>his way over to it carefully, he scooped it up and let it fly, putting<br/>all his strength into a shot at the creature's chest. It hit with a<br/>satisfying chunk, and Ranma smiled grimly.<p>His smile faded as he realized it had stuck into the carapace, instead<br/>of traveling through the creature, as it would have on most terrestrial<br/>animals. Moreover, it seemed to be coming loose as Ranma watched.<p>Still avoiding swiping claws and the occasional tail, the pigtailed<br/>martial artist watched it hit the ground and sizzle, the part that had<br/>been imbedded a bubbling froth of dissolving metal, much like Ukyo's<br/>larger spatula. Yellowish fluid spurted from the wound as if<br/>pressurized, and Ranma realized he'd have to avoid that as well as the<br/>claws and tail now.<p>Ryouga wiped his mouth swiftly, feeling something rise up behind him.<br/>Glowing a sickly green, he whirled, holding his hands out and screaming<br/>"Shi Shi Hokodan!" into the creature's face. A black and green ball of<br/>Ki grew rapidly between his cupped hands, growing from the size of a<br/>basketball to the size of a medicine ball in the blink of an eye. As its<br/>edges touched the creature, there was a soft fizzle, and the thing's<br/>face, arms, and chest were vaporized leaving the thing's back half to<br/>slump to the ground. Ryouga lowered his aim, and released the blast,<br/>wiping the remains of the abomination from existence.<p>Ukyo watched Ryouga disappear behind a ball of light, and winced as she<br/>saw his smoking body emerge from the far side of the building his back<br/>had just been up against. The building itself collapse a moment later,<br/>the human projectile adding to the damage the explosion to its side had<br/>caused. Nabiki managed to tie Ukyo's bandolier around the acid burns and<br/>the two of them ran over to Ryouga's battered body, hoping he was okay.<p>Ranma felt Ryouga's Shi Shi Hokodan go off, and scowled at the creature<br/>before him. Considering how dangerous simply damaging these things in<br/>hand-to-hand was, a Ki blast was about the only thing he could use to<br/>neutralize these things without taking any damage from the beast's<br/>highly acidic blood.<p>Trying to build up his courage, he grimaced as he realized today had<br/>been too horrific to allow him to harness the emotion necessary for a<br/>Moko Takabisha. Unfortunately, before he could start harvesting the<br/>abundant depression, the creature began a new tactic, pouncing at him<br/>from a crouch like it had from the wall, keeping him on the move, and<br/>unable to power up. Apparently, while not the most intelligent<br/>creatures, it knew not to let him stand still.<p>"Ukyo! Get Ryouga up! This thing won't let me blast it!"<p>"He's out cold, Ranchan!" Ukyo cried back, watching her Fiancé dodge the<br/>creature, which was acting like a homicidal cricket at the moment.<br/>Ryouga groaned under her, and she glanced down, frowning at the blood<br/>that trickled from numerous cuts and burns he'd amassed.<p>Ranma cursed under his breath as he dove out of the path of another<br/>pounce, wincing as the things tail managed to lash out and strike him<br/>again. If Ryouga couldn't, he'd have to resort to the Saotome Secret<br/>Techniques, which would be dangerous with the creature's body chemistry.<p>Suddenly Ranma felt a buildup of depressive Ki behind him. Apparently,<br/>Ukyo and Nabiki had gotten Ryouga up, and the lost boy was charging<br/>another powerful blast. All he had to do now was lure the beast into it.<br/>Leaping back, his back towards the building blast, the creature pounced<br/>again, and Ranma fell back, giving Ryouga a chance to let fly...<p>"Shi Shi Hokodan."<p>Ranma blinked. That was not Ryouga. He was, however, shocked as a beam<br/>of black energy tore through the space he'd occupied moments ago,<br/>vaporizing the creature, and continuing on towards the clouds near the<br/>horizon. The beam flickered then, before shrinking to nothingness, and<br/>Ranma finally rolled over, in time to see Nabiki slump. Her clothes<br/>disintegrated, and Ranma realized she'd managed to pull off the blast<br/>through sheer luck, coming close to destroying herself in the process.<p>"Nabiki?" Ukyo said, shocked. Ranma rolled over and crawled to his feet,<br/>moving over to Ukyo, who helped him move the two prone bodies away from<br/>the dust and debris of the collapsed building.<p>Setting Ryouga down beside Nabiki, Ranma stared at the remaining Tendo<br/>curiously. Nabiki might have practiced the art in her youth, but she<br/>showed very little inclination to learning the higher forms of Anything<br/>Goes. What she had done was, to put it bluntly, impossible. Nabiki<br/>coughed then, and looked at Ranma through lit eyelids.<p>"Why don't you take a picture, Saotome; it'll last longer." She coughed<br/>again, and Ranma frowned as he saw flecks of blood dot her lips.<br/>Suddenly realizing she was also naked, Ranma spun, and Ukyo moved off<br/>towards the destroyed building, returning with a length of cloth she<br/>quickly covered Nabiki with.<p>"We should move, before any more of those things show up..." Ukyo said,<br/>softly.<p>"Where?" wheezed Nabiki. Ryouga groaned, and Ranma wished he could throw<br/>some water in the lost boy's face to help bring him back to<br/>consciousness sooner.<p>"We can go back to my place," Ukyo offered. Ranma looked at Nabiki, who<br/>nodded slowly, and picked Ryouga up, turning towards the Ucchan's.<p>"Hold it right there!"<p>Ukyo and Ranma turned, wincing as they stared into the blinding beam of<br/>a flashlight.<p>Officer Nakahara nodded to himself as he radioed for backup. Another<br/>"incident" and these two were here again, about to leave the area with<br/>two unconscious, battered bodies.<p>"Set those two down slowly, then raise your hands in the air," he<br/>commanded, his weapon drawn. The two, Ranma Saotome and Ukyo Kuonji,<br/>glanced at each other, then set the two bodies down, lifting their arms<br/>in the air. He scowled as Kuonji failed to raise one arm all the way,<br/>and grinned to himself as he saw the bloodied bandage on her arm.<p>"So your latest victims fought back, eh?"<p>"Wha- you think we're the kidnappers?" Ukyo said, incredulously.<p>"As a matter of fact, I do," Nakahara said calmly as he heard someone<br/>running up behind him.<p>"Good god! Masanto! They killed him!" someone said. Nakahara scowled at<br/>the two martial artists as another officer came up behind him.<p>"These two the ones?"<p>"Yeah. You say they killed Masanto?" Nakahara asked, frowning.<p>"Ripped his head clean off, looks like. Sick fucks," the new officer<br/>said, aiming his weapon at the two, "Cuff 'em. If they so much as<br/>twitch, I'll pump them full of lead."<p>"It wasn't us! It was the creatures!" Ukyo cried, as he handcuffed her.<p>Nakahara rolled his eyes and snorted. "Right," he said, pulling Ranma's<br/>arms behind his back, " So where are they? Sunlight scare them off?"<p>Ranma groaned as Nakahara harshly patted him down for weapons, grinning<br/>as he practically slapped Ranma's bruised ribs. Ukyo scowled, but said<br/>nothing, silently glaring at the police car as Nakahara moved to search<br/>her. She prepared to lash out if he so much as lingered at any one<br/>point, but he was professional in his search, turning the two around and<br/>ordering them to walk between them towards the station. As they left the<br/>area, three more officers rushed by towards Ryouga and Nabiki.<p>As she watched Ranma and Ukyo get taken away, Nabiki tried to protest,<br/>but only succeeded in coughing up some more blood. Then a pair of rough<br/>hands touched her throat, feeling for a pulse. "This one's alive! We<br/>need an ambulance!" someone shouted right above her. Her ears rang at<br/>the abuse, and she groaned, the officer above her turning his gaze back<br/>at her.<p>"You're safe now. Everything's going to be all right. Just stay with<br/>us." Nabiki groaned and nodded, deciding she could help Ranma and Ukyo<br/>soon enough. As darkness engulfed her vision, she heard the officer<br/>holding her began shouting for help, before the world went black.<p>Nabiki awoke with a shout; feeling an IV in her arm and the cool, steady<br/>flow of oxygen into her nose from a tube taped to her face. Reaching up<br/>to tear the tube away, she looked around, recognizing the hospital room<br/>for what is was, and spotting a police officer watching her from a chair<br/>across the room.<p>"Bad dreams?" he asked with a smile. She shuddered, not bothering to<br/>answer, and he stood up. "Let me go get the doctor, he told me to get<br/>him when you woke up." Nabiki didn't bother replying, simply staring at<br/>the IV in her arm, before pulling it out with a grimace. She began to<br/>crawl out of the bed, but someone cleared his throat from the doorway,<br/>the sound making her pause before he spoke.<p>"That, young lady, isn't the wisest of choices. While you may be feeling<br/>somewhat better, you're still quite beat up inside."<p>Glancing at the doctor with a "don't-patronize-me" glare, she managed to<br/>get her feet on the floor, wobbling slightly as she held the bed until<br/>the earthquake passed.<p>"I have to get Ranma and Ukyo," she said, closing her eyes as the world<br/>spun around her.<p>"Your abductors? Rest assured, when this is over, they'll be getting all<br/>the help the medical community can give them," the doctor said, moving<br/>towards her and reaching for his stethoscope.<p>Nabiki's resulting scowl drove the doctor back a step, and he sighed.<p>"Have a seat, Miss Tendo, and in a moment, I'll send in the officer<br/>assigned to you. You can tell him everything about your kidnapping." He<br/>quickly checked her over, frowning a little, before turning towards the<br/>door. Nabiki sighed as she realized how much talking she'd have to do to<br/>get Ranma and Ukyo out of there.<p>"Right. My 'kidnapping.'" Nabiki sneered as she sat back down on her<br/>bed. Then she remembered, "Where's Ryouga?"<p>"The young man with you? He's still unconscious at the moment. We're not<br/>quite sure when he'll wake up, but it could be any minute." With that,<br/>he left, a female officer in plainclothes entering a moment later and<br/>sitting nearby.<p>"Feeling a bit better than before, I see. I'm officer Yutani, but you<br/>can call me Konoko."<p>"Yutani? Like the company?" Nabiki asked. The officer smiled.<p>"My husband started it." Nabiki nodded. Yutani Corp. was a small<br/>business, but Nabiki had invested in it, liking the way it was laid out,<br/>and had been pleased with the steady growth it had displayed. Shaking<br/>her head to get her thoughts back on track, she looked at the door, then<br/>the officer, before speaking.<p>"Ranma and Ukyo are innocent. This is a big misunderstanding." Officer<br/>Yutani smiled and scooted closer to Nabiki, taking the younger girls<br/>hands in hers.<p>"Nabiki, it's okay now. Those two are under strict surveillance, and<br/>can't hurt you or anyone else, any more. You don't have to fear telling<br/>the truth."<p>"Say what?" Nabiki replied, incredulously. Officer Yutani frowned.<p>"You don't have to protect them. They are already convicted of killing<br/>officer Sato."<p>"But the creature did that!" Nabiki said, realizing after she said that<br/>how unbelievable it would probably be.<p>"Creature," Konoko said, flatly.<p>"Yes. Ranma and Ukyo... and Ryouga were fighting them... whatever they<br/>were." Nabiki said quietly. Well, she'd started down this path, might as<br/>well stick to it.<p>"Well, can you describe this 'creature'?" Yutani said, pulling out her<br/>pen and paper.<p>Nabiki went on to describe the creature the others had fought, until<br/>Konoko held up her hand to signal for her to stop.<p>"So, two meters, black, bleeds acid, kills indiscriminately..." Nabiki<br/>nodded, glancing at the window.<p>Yutani sighed, flipping to a fresh page and hoping the rest of the<br/>interview wouldn't continue like this.<p>Ranma glared at the mirror he knew he was being watched behind, and<br/>briefly considered breaking the weak chains on the handcuffs and jumping<br/>through the glass. It would probably get him killed, but at least he'd<br/>go down fighting. The room he found himself in was sanitary and brightly<br/>lit, a stark contrast to the dull interrogation rooms he'd seen in<br/>movies. Before he could contemplate further, the door swung open, and<br/>three people entered, two in suits, and one officer in uniform.<p>The first man sat down across from him and smiled.<p>"Ranma? I'm your court-appointed lawyer, Mr. Kajiura."<p>Ranma ignored him, still staring at the mirror.<p>"Detective Kano." The other man in the suit said, frowning at Ranma.<p>Ranma didn't reply, and the detective sat down with a pen and paper,<br/>flipping through the printed file he'd brought with him for a second<br/>before setting them down and leaning forward to stare Ranma in the eyes.<p>"Look, son. It's fairly obvious you don't like me, and after what you<br/>did to Masanto, the feeling is entirely mutual. So lets get one thing<br/>straight. You tell me what happened, no bullshit stories about fairy<br/>tale monsters, and we can both leave each other's company as soon as<br/>possible."<p>"Detective" Kajiura said, warningly. The detective nodded, and sat back.<p>"Well start with some simple yes/no questions, first, then begin to get<br/>your statement after that. First Question, you are Ranma Saotome, son of<br/>Genma and Nodoka Saotome, correct?"<p>Ranma refused to answer, still glaring at the mirror. Kano sighed,<br/>realizing it would be another one of those condemning silence-cases,<br/>before starting down the list of questions.<p>Ranma's gaze never left the glossy reflective surface of the mirror<br/>throughout the interview.<p>Ukyo Kuonji looked around the cell in disbelief; her Okonomiyaki-sellers<br/>outfit the only comfort in the spartan area. All throughout the<br/>interview, she'd tried to tell the police, her lawyer; anyone who'd<br/>listen about the creatures, but everyone had treated her like she was<br/>insane.<p>Sitting on the hard bed, Ukyo stared down at the cement floor beneath<br/>her, and wondered what she was going to do now. As her vision blurred,<br/>tears welling up before falling to the floor steadily, she wished she'd<br/>just remained silent throughout the interview. As she'd been lead here,<br/>she could see the angered faces; feel the glares on her back as she was<br/>paraded through the station. She sobbed as she realized how hated she<br/>was by every Officer there, and for doing nothing.<p>The dead officer, his brains eaten by the beast Ryouga had vaporized,<br/>was on every Officer's mind, and she and Ranma were, in the their eyes,<br/>his killer.<p>There was a loud clank as the entrance to the holding area opened, and<br/>another Officer escorted Ranma to the cell one left and across from her.<br/>He looked at her, and his angry scowl melted for an instant, before he<br/>turned towards the cell in which he was to be placed, and stepped<br/>inside.<p>When the guards left, Ranma looked over at Ukyo, and sighed.<p>The two looked at each other for a moment, before glancing away, unsure<br/>of what to say in their current predicament. Finally, Ranma spoke.<p>"Sorry for getting you involved in all this, Ucchan."<p>Ukyo stared at him incredulously, before she began to giggle.<p>"What's so funny?" Ranma asked, staring at her worriedly.<p>"I just... You didn't get me involved, sugar. I chose to come along,"<br/>Ukyo said, staring at the ground and growing serious, "Not that I did<br/>much good. In the end, Nabiki was more effective than I was."<p>"Hey, don't go doubting yourself because of that. Just because you<br/>didn't fight too well doesn't mean you didn't help."<p>"Gee thanks, Ranma. You sure know how to make a girl feel better."<p>"Damnit, Ukyo! That's not what I meant. I... What the hell are we going<br/>to DO?"<p>"Sit here, I think. Eventually those things will take more people, and<br/>the police will realize we're not the kidnappers."<p>"But, those things are out there, killing people and.. they're doing<br/>that.. whatever they do, too... like... like Akane..."<p>Ukyo nodded, staring at the floor.<p>"What about that dead cop, though?" Ranma said, finally. Ukyo shuddered,<br/>looking at Ranma.<p>"I don't know, Ranchan. Ryouga destroyed the creature that got him, like<br/>Nabiki."<p>Ranma sighed, " I wish we knew where they come from. We could just tell<br/>the police to go there."<p>"Well, I think they're from outer space." Ukyo said, looking at Ranma.<p>"I don't know. Aliens are supposed to be small and gray, with big eyes.<br/>Those things are demons or something."<p>"Who says aliens are small and gray?" Ukyo asked.<p>"It's in all the movies!"<p>"These aren't movie monsters, Ranma."<p>"You can say that again. After what they did to... Akane..." Ranma<br/>trailed off, his posture slumping again, and Ukyo sighed, watching Ranma<br/>slip back into his depression. Seeing that had a similar effect on her,<br/>and she moved over to the lumpy cot she shared the cell with, and sat<br/>down on it.<p>"I'm going to sleep, Ranma. We'll talk more later."<p>"Alright," she heard from the other cell. Turning her back to the world,<br/>Ukyo closed her eyes, ignoring the tears that once again fell freely<br/>from her eyes.<p>There was a steady beeping noise to his left. Peeling his eyelids back,<br/>Ryouga Hibiki turned in that direction to see an EKG steadily matching<br/>the blood he could feel pulsing through his veins.<p>Turning to look at the window, he realized he was in a hospital, and it<br/>was dark out, meaning he'd been out for a few minutes, or, more likely,<br/>all day. How had he come to be here? Frowning, he tried to think back to<br/>earlier. He'd been walking through Osaka, when he spotted Ranma and<br/>Akane...<p>"Ranma!" He growled, sitting up. The room, steady as can be moments ago,<br/>suddenly wobbled around him, and he collapsed back as a wave of nausea<br/>threatened to overtake him.<p>Trying to remember what had happened afterwards, Ryouga felt his ire<br/>lessen when his memory reasserted itself. The creatures. The Tendo's.<br/>His Shi Shi Hokodan. Looking himself over, he realized firing one off at<br/>point blank range wasn't the smartest of ideas, and decided that, next<br/>time he faced one of those things, he'd try to keep his distance.<p>So, Akane was... Dead. Staring at the window Again, Ryouga felt bitter<br/>tears of defeat leave salty trails down his cheeks as he remembered all<br/>the times he'd had with her. Then he thought about how she'd died, and<br/>sat up again, fighting off the nausea. Ranma had said something was<br/>inside of her. A baby one of those things...<p>Feeling bile rise in the back of his throat, he thought about the past<br/>few weeks, and struggled to get out of his bed. He needed to find<br/>Nabiki. And then, he needed to die.<p>Nabiki watched Konoko Yutani leave with a sigh. It was obvious nobody<br/>believed her story, and wondered how many people it would take telling<br/>the same general story before the police started to believe her. Looking<br/>at the window, she realized the sun had set while she was talking, and<br/>crawled back into bed, hoping Yutani would keep her word and let her see<br/>Ranma and Ukyo soon.<p>"Nabiki!"<p>Turning, Nabiki watched Ryouga entered the room, dragging two police<br/>officers behind him. One pistol-whipped him, hoping to drop the crazed<br/>kid, but was surprised when, instead of dropping, the kid turned and<br/>threw him into the wall, hard. The other officer drew his gun, then, and<br/>Ryouga froze. A figure jumped between the weapon and Ryouga, and the<br/>officer frowned as he realized it was the girl he was supposed to be<br/>guarding.<p>"Move, girl!"<p>Nabiki scowled, turning to Ryouga, "Lets get out of here."<p>Ryouga nodded, looking at the hallway, where the officer was trying to<br/>get around Nabiki, who was blocking the doorway, then at the window,<br/>where he could see the tops of streetlights. Nabiki stepped back and to<br/>the side, suddenly, apparently to let the officer inside. Stepping<br/>forward, Nabiki slammed the door on him, hoping the cracking noise<br/>wasn't the officer's nose. Ryouga stared at the door for a moment, then<br/>pushed it shut, throwing the bed up against it.<p>"Window?" Ryouga asked. Nabiki nodded, and Ryouga used a chair to break<br/>the glass out of the window, while Nabiki looked for a way to open it.<br/>Shrugging, she looked down at the slivers of glass littering the<br/>sidewalk below, and frowned. The officers outside were banging on the<br/>door, yelling to be let in, and the two looked at the door before<br/>locking gazes again.<p>"You're going to have to carry me."<p>Ryouga froze up, staring at the open-backed hospital gown Nabiki was<br/>wearing, and feeling his blood pound. Nabiki frowned.<p>"Damnit, Ryouga! This is no time for modesty! We have to get Ukyo and<br/>Ranma, and stop these things before they get any worse! The longer we<br/>wait, the more people... the more families die." Nabiki sighed, thinking<br/>of her family, then looked at Ryouga, who had regained his composure<br/>somewhat.<p>"Hold on tight," he said, somewhat nervously, before scooping her up and<br/>jumping out the window moments before the door was kicked open.<p>=====================<p>Disclaimer: Rumiko Takahashi owns Ranma ½.
