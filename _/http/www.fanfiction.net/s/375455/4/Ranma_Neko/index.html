</div>"Umm," Yuka stared down at her amulet and continued to<br/>try to figure out what was going. "I don't know what<br/>it's doing."<p>"Mind if I take a look?" Penny asked. Yuka nodded and<br/>started to lift it off her neck. "No don't take it<br/>off! It's magic, you don't know what'll happen if you<br/>take it off!" Yuka froze and carefully let it fall<br/>back around her neck.<p>"Ummm," Yuka said again. "This has been in my family<br/>for a long time. I..it's never done anything like this<br/>before."<p>"Hmm," looked over the amulet closely, intrigued. "I<br/>might need Gina's help on this one. It's Japanese<br/>hiragana, but the words aren't Japanese."<p>"Those are words?" Yuka asked. She glanced back and<br/>forth for a moment before continuing in a whisper. "I<br/>sort of thought they were just decoration. It was made<br/>by gaijin ancestor of mine."<p>"Considering all of us are gaijin here," Penny said<br/>harshly. "That's hardly something to be embarrassed<br/>about. You wouldn't happen to know where in the world<br/>that gaijin came from would you?"<p>"Ummm," she said calmly. "Africa." Penny considered<br/>that and smirked.<p>"That cuts things down a bit," she said triumphantly.<br/>She looked to Stripe and switched to English.<br/>"Britanny said her family had been living on the<br/>Serenghetti, right?"<p>"That's right," Stripe said curiously. "Why do you<br/>need to know?"<p>"Well, let's start from there then," Penny said as she<br/>continued to study the glowing amulet, marvelling that<br/>the glow didn't seem to obscure any of the marks.<p>Nobody noticed the matching glow faintly emanating<br/>from under Lydia's eyes.<p>********<p>"History is what the winners make of it," a voice<br/>said.<p>Lydia turned about and almost felt herself frightened<br/>into her human form as she saw the tawny figure<br/>walking toward her.<p>The emotional response at seeing the lion-woman stride<br/>forward seemed to just hit a brick wall and stop. It<br/>was as if her there was something beside herself<br/>telling her to be afraid. Lydia appeared confused at<br/>the sensation and prepared for the woman to approach<br/>her.<p>"No spells shall reach here," the lion-woman said.<br/>"You won't have a problem with fearing cats any more<br/>than you would normally."<p>"What %$^$# spells?" Lydia asked suspiciously. She<br/>watched a stone circle form underneath her and the<br/>woman. It was an old circle engraved with<br/>heiroglyphics. "You mean the spells Iceron cast upon<br/>you #$% cats to scare us."<p>"Iceron yes," the woman said as she started to<br/>stretch. Her tufted tail whipped in a manner that<br/>appeared to be slow and lazy, but actually involved a<br/>great deal of control and endurance. "The cats no. No<br/>this particular spell was cast on you specifically."<p>"What do you mean on me specifically?" Lydia asked.<br/>"It's not like Iceron is still around to cast<br/>spells."<p>"Iceron is around," the woman said. "Drastically<br/>reduced in power since he underestimated a young<br/>human, but still dangerous."<p>The woman stood up and stretched, suddenly Lydia noted<br/>that she was dressed in something like the Egyptian<br/>warrior chicks in the Mummy Returns had worn. Lydia<br/>herself was dressed in her own full battle armor,<br/>instinctively she could feel all her standard weapons<br/>in place.<p>"What the #$%'s going on?" Lydia asked getting into<br/>stance.<p>"I'm going to give you a test," the woman said. Lydia<br/>tensed at the way the woman phrased test. Zero often<br/>talked like that.<p>"What's your name?" Lydia demanded getting ready for<br/>battle.<p>"I'm called Sehkmet," the woman said, a staff<br/>appearing in her hand. "Let's begin."<p>********<p>"Any sign of Lydia McKracken?" Gothwrain asked.<p>"No Lord," the wererat in front of him said. "Moisha<br/>Rich is in the custody of the cats and an apparent<br/>traitor, however. We should be able to get her easy<br/>enough."<p>"Miss Rich is of no consequence," Gothwrain snapped.<br/>"Find, Lydia. Either alive or dead, it doesn't matter<br/>as long as you find her."<p>"I don't understand," the wererat said perplexed. "She<br/>is a child, what is her importance."<p>"You don't need to know her importance," Gothwrain<br/>said icily. "She is important to me, that is all you<br/>need to know." The wererat blinked and bowed, leaving<br/>the room.<p>~I never thought that he'd turn sentimental about<br/>anyone,~ the wererat thought in a confused manner.<br/>Gothwrain looked out the window into the world and<br/>frowned at the turn of events.<p>He had thought he had found the focus of the prophecy.<br/>After all there had only been one werecheetah left.<br/>Then these others began to pop up. He wasn't even<br/>certain if the werecheetah in question had to be born<br/>with the proper genes anymore. For all he knew, it<br/>could have been an awakened werecheetah, or even an<br/>infected one.<p>To make matters worse he had lost her. His precious<br/>trophy. It was so pleasing to see her doing even minor<br/>tasks of his will.<p>Suddenly his eyes widened.<p>"Wait!" he called out. "I have a better idea." The old<br/>man smiled darkly as the wererat started walking back<br/>to him.<p>********<p>"Lord Gothwrain will debrief you himself when he is<br/>ready," the bodyguard said. "Until that time you stay<br/>in the room."<p>"But I was hoping to know if there has been any word<br/>of Lydia and Moisha," Romeo said.<p>"You let the cats get them," the man said, dripping<br/>hostility. "What do you think happened to them?" Romeo<br/>winced at that and by the time he recovered the door<br/>was closed and he was locked in his room.<p>Romeo frowned as he considered that his ineptitude had<br/>cost him his two closest friends. It was right that he<br/>should die to make up for the failure.<p>He sighed and looked around himself at the comfortable<br/>room they had put him in. A comfortable, escape proof<br/>room. The ventilator in the ceiling above allowed some<br/>air into the room and he took a deep breath in<br/>preparation of a sigh.<p>His breath caught in his throat as he caught a scent<br/>on the air. It smelled like soul char and...blood?<br/>Familiar blood.<p>"But...she wasn't hurt when I brought her in," Romeo<br/>said hesitantly. He stood up and looked at the<br/>ventilator, and concentrated. He thought he could hear<br/>something in the background.<p>********<p>"It hurts doesn't it, traitor?" the man asked her.<p>Nabiki blinked, breathing heavily.<p>"What are you talking about?" she asked wearily,<br/>eyeing the silver bar the man held in his hand. "I<br/>don't even kn...AAHHHH!" The man snapped the bar<br/>into her back again.<p>"We saw that your sister speaking to those cats," he<br/>said. "She even seemed to be telling them what to do."<p>"Akane?" Nabiki gasped. "She's on Jade." She cursed<br/>herself for letting that slip out.<p>"Well the white-furred bitch is back!" the man<br/>snapped, striking her again. Nabiki welcomed the<br/>strike, as the scream hid her own gasp of surprise.<p>"Stop now," Gothwrain's voice said over the intercom.<br/>"She might not be complicit in her sibiling's<br/>behavior. This is plenty of punishment for the<br/>accident of her birth."<p>Nabiki dropped as they untied her arms and she weakly<br/>struggled to stand up. Her torturer kicked her in the<br/>face as she started to rise and she fell back down,<br/>crying out in pain. She was dimmly aware of the man<br/>leaving her room and the door closing behind her.<p>"My apologies Miss Tendo," Gothwrain's disembodied<br/>voice said sorrowfully. Nabiki bought it about as much<br/>as she bought the idea that Akane had dyed her her<br/>white. "There was an insistance among the elders that<br/>at least a little punishment be levied towards you for<br/>your involvement with the enemy."<p>"Go away," Nabiki snapped, crawling onto the bed and<br/>lying on her stomach. She was in no mood to duel wits<br/>with him, and would, if possible, just deny him the<br/>sport.<p>"As you wish," Gothwrain said, and the intercom<br/>switched off. Nabiki's breath almost caught in<br/>surprise at that. Certainly he'd try to banter with<br/>her more. She shivered...unless these were just the<br/>preliminaries.<p>********<p>He shifted in his rest.<p>He blinked and realized something.<p>First he was thinking clearly for the first time in<br/>centuries.<p>~What has happened,~ he thought. Then he remembered.<p>An amateur magician had enacted a binding ceremony to<br/>force him into some human child. If the attempted<br/>enslavement wasn't enough of an insult, he had used<br/>some flawed ritual. It had almost destroyed him and<br/>the child. Instead of an obediant and powerful<br/>servant, the old fool had driven the both of them<br/>insane.<p>"Am I free?" he asked.<p>A shiver ran through his world. An overwhelming rush<br/>of fear washed over the realm, and he almost reverted<br/>to an instinctual creature intent on fighting the<br/>source of the fear. He was still in that child.<p>And that child was walking into a confrontation of the<br/>demonic variety.<p>"Careful, human," he growled. "You'll destroy us both<br/>if you're not careful."<p>********<p>"Oh my..." Ranma gasped quietly. Everyone turned<br/>around to stare at him as they appeared at the sight<br/>of the demon's death. He seemed pale even through the<br/>fur, and just the look at how his fur was sticking on<br/>end set Akane's teeth on edge.<p>"What's wrong, Ranma," Akane asked. Julia and Nodoka<br/>were likewise confused, but Theo's face turned equally<br/>pale as he looked at Ranma's aura.<p>"It's a spirit," he said, impressed.<p>"What's a spirit?" Nodoka asked nervously.<p>"You don't mean the Neko-Ken," Julia asked. "Do you?"<p>"He d...does," Ranma squeaked nervously.<p>"You mean...Ranma is possessed?" Akane demanded.<p>********<p>"You understand now what we're dealing with," Sheila<br/>said as they reached the bottom of the cavern. "This<br/>isn't something to treat with kid gloves and give a<br/>second chance."<p>"I guess not," Ranko said sullenly. She stopped for a<br/>moment and considered.<p>Ranma would have been willing to kill by now. In fact<br/>he had been quite ready to kill that oni long ago, and<br/>he had basically killed Saffron's last incarnation.<br/>Ranko was still looking for ways around it.<p>"Just..." Brianna paused worried at the sudden stop.<br/>"Just keep on your toes and let Sheila and me handle<br/>the actually finishing them off." Sheila's expression<br/>clearly showed that Brianna's comment was quite a bit<br/>beyond her power.<p>"I don't think I'm going to continue perfecting the<br/>Art," Ranko said, looking down at her hands. She<br/>started walking forward again.<p>********<p>"That way!" another spirit was declaring loudly. "That<br/>way is the prey!"<p>She really did feel bad about scaring the human she<br/>was bound with, but she could smell the demons coming.<br/>She wasn't free to fight as she choose, but this girl<br/>seemed skilled enough to fight these demons. And she<br/>could always kill them if they tried to take the<br/>girl's soul.<p>Ranko suddenly froze and started shaking, looking as<br/>if the most horrible thing in the world had been<br/>placed before her. In a way, it had.<p>"I...i..i..it's t... way," Ranko said. Brianna<br/>and Sheila both looked at her curiously and looked<br/>down the cold, seemingly fireless tunnel she had just<br/>pointed out.<p>"Are you sure?" Brianna asked.<p>"How can you possibly know?" Sheila asked.<p>"T...t...the Ne..kk...ko..ken...told me," she said<br/>shivering almost uncontrolably.<p>********<p>Nabiki snapped awake with a headache. She'd been in<br/>contact with enough magic to know an attempt to<br/>rearrange her mind when she felt one. Maybe she had<br/>fought this one off by instinct, but the next time.<br/>She wasn't really trained for this, and the physical<br/>threat wasn't helping her concentration.<p>She shivered as she realized that she would fall<br/>eventually.<p>"I guess there's just the Mandarin approach then," she<br/>whispered to herself. At least when she got out of<br/>here they now knew some magicians who should be able<br/>to remove whatever her captors did to her.<p>********<p>"Are you sure she's going to be fine?" Yuka asked,<br/>indicating Lydia. "S...she hasn't woken up yet." Penny<br/>glanced over at Lydia, but only gave her a cursory<br/>glance.<p>"Looks like she's mostly healed," Penny said, turning<br/>back to the notes she had taken on Yuka's amulet.<p>She thought she had it right, but was checking her<br/>translations again to make sure. She was considering<br/>asking Yuka to let her look directly at it again to<br/>see if she had everything right.<p>"She's probably just sleeping it off now."<p>"Maybe she's making it glow," Charlotte said, pointing<br/>to Lydia. Penny glanced at her confused.<p>"I seriously doubt that, Charlie," Penny said. Then<br/>she paused. "Incidentally, why do you say that?"<p>"Well her eyes are glowing the same color and..."<br/>Charlotte didn't get to finish as Penny sat up to<br/>examine Lydia's eyes closely.<p>"Stripe," Penny called out. "Any of those artifacts<br/>give you telepathy?"<p>"No, Penny," he said, coming over to look at the<br/>wererat as well.<p>"Penny," Ace called back. "We're going to land pretty<br/>soon, better get ready to move everybody for the trip<br/>to Japan."<p>********<p>Lydia flipped over a strike and then ducked down into<br/>the splits as Sehkmet flashed her staff back in an<br/>attempt to catch her. Lydia rose up from the ground on<br/>one hand, sending a dagger flying out of her other.<br/>Sehkmet barely dodged to the side as the dagger<br/>slashed past her feline face. The silver dagger didn't<br/>burn her.<p>"If you're going to give me weapons for this fight<br/>were-bitch," Lydia said flipping over Sehkmet's head<br/>and landing on the staff as the cat tried to strike on<br/>the landing. "At least make it real silver-omph!"<p>Her perch had whipped out from under her at a speed<br/>that she would have thought impossible and then the<br/>other end smacked into her. Lydia's next thoughts were<br/>encompassed by the onrushing wall. She quickly adapted<br/>Zero's soft fall technique and twisted around to<br/>bounce off the wall, wondering just when that had<br/>become part of the terrain.<p>"Who ever said I was a were-lion, Miss McKraken?"<br/>Sehkmet asked, she lunged forward striking with her<br/>staff in a series of precise attacks. Lydia shifted<br/>into her rat form and flowed through them by virtue of<br/>that, skittering under and past Sehkmet's reach.<p>Shifting into her hybrid from as she reached Sehkmet's<br/>side. A swift strike with her sword followed, only<br/>barely blocked to the side by a vertical spinning<br/>block from the staff.<p>"You're overcommitting, lady," Lydia sneered as she<br/>backed off and sat into stance to wait for the woman<br/>to come again. As long as she held her weapons she had<br/>a chance against this...person. ~Wait...if this is a<br/>dream. Zero says creativity is almost vital to<br/>victory. In this case, I think it's just little<br/>#$%# more important than that.~<p>Sehkmet's eyes narrowed angrily.<p>"You had better be who I think you are," Sehkmet<br/>growled. "No one presumes to correct me."<p>Before Lydia could respond Sehkmet was charging<br/>forward. The staff stabbed past Lydia, and the rat<br/>slashed downward with her sword as her other hand<br/>slashed up. Curiously, it contained the dagger she had<br/>thrown into the darkness before the wall had risen.<p>Sehkmet gasped in surprise as her staff was snapped in<br/>two and nearly allowed herself to be cut as Lydia<br/>stabbed outward with her dagger. Sehkmet frantically<br/>twisted the remainder of her staff about to force the<br/>dagger to the side. She smirked in victory, though her<br/>eyes seemed sad, as she met barely any resistance to<br/>the push and Lydia rolled along with the block.<p>Then she noticed Lydia dipping low in what wasn't a<br/>roll but a spin. In the next moment her feet were<br/>taken out from under her. She rolled back to her feet<br/>and looked with a considerate frown as she looked over<br/>her opponent. Lydia's only angry and determined look<br/>as she gracefully returned to standing was so<br/>different than the cheerful face she rememebred,<br/>but...<p>"You think to directly," Lydia said. "You got to #^&amp;$<br/>think outside the (##$ box." ~When did I learn a<br/>sweep? Zero must have taught it to us sometime.~<p>Sehkmet almost facefaulted at the use of profanity.<br/>She looked at Lydia with a massive sweatdrop. The rat<br/>wasn't at all what she remembered.<p>"You're a few thousand years too young to beat me so<br/>easily, mortal," Sehkmet said angrily. "You continue<br/>to presume to correct a goddess."<p>"Goddess?" Lydia asked in surprise.<p>Then Sehkmet was charging forward with a pair of<br/>golden axes. Lydia blinked and rolled out of the way<br/>rather than parry. There was no way she was going to<br/>win in contest of strength with the lion-woman.<p>~Need to keep her moving,~ Lydia decided. ~She doesn't<br/>seem to %#%## change things around so much while<br/>she's fighting.~<p>"Keep dodging, mortal," Sehkmet growled angrily.<br/>"You'll tire, I won't."<p>Lydia dodged around a little more before lashing out<br/>again with what were no longer a dagger and a sword<br/>but a pair of sais. The axes were ripped from Sehkmets<br/>hands, and then the bars of the sais were slammed into<br/>her abdomen.<p>Sehkmet doubled over and then went flying as Lydia<br/>kicked upward. Sehkmet started to roll in the air to<br/>hit the wall as Lydia had done, by the time she had<br/>turned around, however, holes had appeared in her<br/>wall. Her arms and legs slipped through and she<br/>slammed full into the wall slipping down to ground<br/>with a dazed groan.<p>In an instant Lydia was ontop of her, claws to her<br/>throat.<p>"You always forget it's a dream when you get into the<br/>fight Sehkmet," Lydia said. "You've never managed to<br/>fix that."<p>Lydia blinked as the angry, surprised look on<br/>Sehkmet's face was replaced with one of near disbelief<br/>and restrained relief and joy. And the woman seemed to<br/>be familiar somehow, and she was getting more familiar<br/>as the dream continued.<p>********<p>"Is...is she okay?" Yuka asked. Penny glanced to her<br/>and looked nervous.<p>"I think so," Penny said. "But with magic...you can<br/>never tell. But listen to this, and tell me what you<br/>think. All I can make out from this amulet is that<br/>it's meant to, quote "to seek and free" and seems to<br/>be dedicated to some lion-goddess, probably Egyptian<br/>originally.<p>"'To seek and free what?" Yuka asked nervously.<p>"Is there anything to be worried about?" Stripe asked<br/>as the helicopter settled down.<p>"Keep an eye on her," Penny said to the kryn. "If she<br/>wakes up as some sort of blood crazed demon, well<br/>then, yes, there's something to worry about."<p>"Huh?" Charlotte said nervously. "B..b..blood crazed<br/>demon?"<p>"It's a figure of speech, Charlie," Penny said. ~I<br/>hope.~<p>********<p>"Sister is that you?" Sehkmet asked cautiously.<p>"My name is Lydia," the rat said confidently. "And I<br/>ain't your %$&amp;^# sister."<p>"It is you," Sehkmet said, revealing a radiant smile<br/>that confused and distracted Lydia for a moment.<p>Then she was flying through dreamscape and her face<br/>smashing into the ground as she suddenly realized that<br/>while her opponent's weaknesses were real, she had<br/>still been holding back.<p>"Think about this, Lydia," Sehkmet said. "How was<br/>Iceron 'killed' the first time?"<p>"What does that have to do with anything?" Lydia asked<br/>as again everything was plunged into darkness.<p>********<p>"Her eyes stopped glowing," Charlie said. Penny<br/>nodded and looked to the amulet which was also fading<br/>back to a seemingly normal piece of jewelry.<p>"So did her amulet," Penny said. "Whatever was meant<br/>to happen has happened. All we can do now is get her<br/>to Gina and deal with it when she wakes up."<p>"You're deferring to Gina on this?" Ace asked, with a<br/>sly smirk on his face.<p>"Give me a break," Penny said. "This is magic, not<br/>science, Gina has more connections in that field than<br/>I have hairs on my head. She is hardly my superior in<br/>the scientific field. It's not like she made the<br/>world or anything."<p>********<p>Akane looked at Ranma cautiously as the revelation<br/>about him being possessed began to raise a number of<br/>questions.<p>"It ain't like I'm in the Neko-ken all the time you<br/>know," Ranma said nervously in response to Akane's<br/>look. "I ain't possessed right now."<p>"And it's not really possession," Dr Diggers said as<br/>he looked closer. "It's more of a binding."<p>"Okay, main question," Julia interrupted. "Will it<br/>affect our capability to deal with whatever is in this<br/>tower?" When neither Theo nor Ranma answered she<br/>continued. "Then let's deal with the other thing<br/>first, and then see about this Neko-Ken."<p>********<p>"Are you sure about this?" Sheila asked as they<br/>tramped through the natural stone caverns. The glow<br/>of the volcanic cavern was fading behind them as they<br/>walked.<p>"Yeah," Brianna said. "It's actually starting to get<br/>cold down here."<p>"That's from Ranko," Genn said.<p>"Huh?" Sheila said, turning around to look at Reiko<br/>carefully. Her breath was coming out as a mist,<br/>though it certainly wasn't cold enough for that where<br/>Sheila was standing.<p>"I...I didn't th...think I c...could do it without<br/>th..that gyuseki th...thingie...b..but I can..." Ranko<br/>said. She laughed, somewhat hysterically. "I wasn't<br/>even trying."<p>"Stop a moment here," Brianna said, insistently,<br/>pulling Ranko over to the side. She almost gasped on<br/>contact with Ranko's skin. The girl almost seemed to<br/>be frozen. "Is it still the Neko-Ken?" Brianna<br/>glanced up at Genn, who nodded, before looking back to<br/>Ranko. Sheila kept a watch on the corridors.<p>"Y..yes," Ranko said. "It won't go<br/>away...it..it...she keeps saying the same thing!<br/>S...she...won't stop...'that way' 'l...let me in'<br/>'prey is that way'...meowing, hissing...meowing..."<p>"Come on," Brianna said. "You're a tough girl."<p>"No, I'm not," Ranko said, shaking her head.<p>"You seem to be handling things fine," Sheila said.<br/>"Just a little stuttering." Sheila thought that if<br/>her worst fear had taken up residence in her head and<br/>kept talking to her she would be a basket case.<p>"Anything near, Genn," Sheila asked, moving near the<br/>rakshasha.<p>"No," he said. Then she nodded and leaned in.<p>"Can't you do something about this problem?" she asked<br/>quietly.<p>"There's something else in her," Genn answered. "I<br/>felt it, and I'm not sure what it is. AND she has<br/>psychic scars too."<p>"So you're just going to leave it there?" Sheila<br/>asked.<p>"I wouldn't where to begin," Genn answered<br/>exasperatedly. "It'd be like trying to do surgery on<br/>the guidance of a random die roll!"<p>"The Soul a Ice don't g..g..get rid of stuff," Ranko<br/>said, answering Sheila's original question without<br/>noticing the conversation between her and Genn. "It<br/>just lets ya...ig...ignore it. I...didn't th...think<br/>about the b...Breath of Ice..."<p>"Is there a problem with the Breath of Ice?" Brianna<br/>asked, concerned.<p>"I...it takes a lot..." Ranko said, eyes looking<br/>somewhat faint though Brianna had to look closely to<br/>see it. "Even with the staff...e..even f..for Ranma.<br/>I...I'm getting tired."<p>"Then stop doing it," Brianna said, it really had to<br/>be tiring for it to be affecting her even with<br/>regeneration to consider. Though Brianna worried<br/>about the "even for Ranma" comment.<p>"Wh..what if the S...soul of Ice goes too," Ranko<br/>asked. "It...it's like s..someone banging on the door<br/>right now..." She clutched at her head and closed her<br/>eyes. "She wants inside."<p>~Damn it," Brianna thought. ~Whatever you are, back<br/>off and give her some breathing space. You're just<br/>going to get both of you killed this way.~<p>Of course it wasn't that simple, and Brianna knew<br/>that.<p>"If this ice breath thing is making you tired, you've<br/>got to shut it down," Brianna said.<p>"But..." Ranko said.<p>"The Neko-ken thing is talking to you right?" Brianna<br/>said. "Talk to it, make a deal."<p>"And offer it what?" Ranko asked angrily. "My eyes on<br/>a nice juicy platter?"<p>"Did it try to kill you before?" Brianna asked.<p>"No," Ranko admitted reluctantly.<p>"It killed the demon thing right?" Brianna asked.<br/>Ranko nodded. "Then it saved you right?" Ranko<br/>nodded again, slowly.<p>"I'll...try," Ranko said.<p>"Okay," Sheila muttered. "Next time I pay the extra<br/>ten gold for the longer duration. I don't see or<br/>smell anything coming, what's happening with her?"<p>"I don't really know," Brianna said to Sheila as Ranko<br/>sat down and seemed to meditate. "Something like when<br/>you hit me on the head that one time."<p>"Ehh?" Sheila said nervously glancing at Ranko.<br/>Brianna blinked and looked down at the concentratiing<br/>Ranko.<p>"It has to do with her fear of cats," Brianna said.<br/>"Something her father did to her and Ranma when they<br/>were kids." It was sort of true, as far as it went.<p>"Not your place to say?" Sheila asked. "Any chance<br/>it's dangerous to us?"<p>"Don't think so," Brianna said...after a pause. She<br/>picked her gun back up and set a watch on her end of<br/>the corridor while Ranko apparently lost all contact<br/>with them. A fact emphasized by the sweat that seemed<br/>to be freezing to her face.<p>********<p>It was easy to drop within her mind. The continual<br/>demands of the neko-ken acted as a beacon that made it<br/>easy to follow, even as she was terrified to do so.<p>"Sss..stop it!" Ranko shouted past the frozen shell of<br/>ice surrounding her conscious mind.<p>"Let me in!" the feline voice demanded. Ranko could<br/>see it's shape but not the awful details she<br/>remembered when it killed the demon.<p>"Leave me alone," Ranko said. "I have to go to a<br/>fight and I can't do that with you..."<p>"But you don't want to fight," the cat noted. Ranko<br/>was silent. "Let me in, and I'll fight for you...I'll<br/>kill for you."<p>"No!" Ranko shouted, her heart skipping a beat as she<br/>saw her carefully constructed shell shiver with the<br/>force of the yell.<p>"You're get tired," the Neko-Ken said. "Why fight me,<br/>I just want to help you."<p>"You want to eat me!" Ranko countered.<p>"I am bound to you," it said hissingly. "You die, I<br/>die. My existence is tied to yours."<p>"And if you die?" Ranko asked nervously, following the<br/>vague form of the neko-ken through the sheet of glass,<br/>thinning as she grew more tired and control became<br/>difficult. The cat hesitated and seemed uncertain for<br/>a moment.<p>"Do you want to try to kill me girl?" it asked<br/>finally. "Why? I've always protected you. I can<br/>remember...faintly...the old woman, the shark, your<br/>father...that pervert that seeks to mate with you...I<br/>have always..." The neko-ken stopped as Ranko started<br/>laughing and dropped to the dark ground of her<br/>mindscape.<p>********<p>"She's laughing," Sheila said, adjusting her frame of<br/>vision to include Ranko. "Is that a good sign or bad<br/>one?"<p>"Listen for purring," Brianna said. "Or meowing...and<br/>then run. I saw her and Ranma fighting in that state<br/>earlier...we don't have what we need to fight her<br/>here. Not without killing her anyway." Sheila looked<br/>to Genn.<p>"She's not having the break down we're worried about,"<br/>Genn said vaguely.<p>********<p>"Your sister is this way," Ranma's neko-ken said. He<br/>added something as it felt the tremor through Ranma's<br/>soul. "I'm not trying to scare you."<p>********<p>"Ranko's that way," Ranma said impatiently, then<br/>winced as the neko-ken spoke again. "I can smell her,<br/>an the others." He hadn't needed the information from<br/>the neko-ken anyway.<p>"So can I Ranma," Akane said, eyes narrowed. "So can<br/>your mother, and I think Diggers-san found some<br/>tracks, and as for Diggers-sensei..." she turned to<br/>look at the white-haired man concentrating hard.<p>"Get ready," Dr. Diggers said. "They've been<br/>noticed."<p>********<p>"Just a copy," Ranko whispered. "Just a copy neko-ken<br/>for a copy Ranma." The neko-ken paused to consider<br/>that.<p>"You're brother is near," it said finally, not<br/>understanding the comment, and defaulting to the<br/>nearest comment it could consider as likely. "I feel<br/>the other raiju. Unless there's more fools who would<br/>subject people to that accursed and flawed ritual."<p>"Ranma is here?" Ranko said, looking up, and blinking,<br/>missing everything else.<p>"Let me fight," the neko-ken demanded, returning to<br/>the original line of thought. "I thought you could<br/>handle it, but you're distracted, and now you won't<br/>let me in as easily as you used to."<p>"You can't have my body," Ranko said.<p>"I don't see any other option unless you can create<br/>one for me," she said. Ranko blinked for a moment.<p>"I could do that," Ranko said.<p>"Excuse me?" the neko-ken said.<p>"I think, I can," Ranko added. She wasn't really<br/>sure, but if it got the thing to leave her alone,<br/>she'd try. She was always of the habit of thinking<br/>through theory more than Ranma, mostly because she was<br/>always lax in physical training and had to make for<br/>it, on the fly, in finesse. Not that Ranma wasn't<br/>especially accomplished in that skill, she just tended<br/>to make more of a habit out of it.<p>"This I have to see," the neko-ken's shape stopped<br/>pacing around her shell and settled down to watch her,<br/>making Ranko rather nervous.<p>~Let me think this through,~ Ranko thought. ~Chi is<br/>life-force an' I can sorta put it out, right, but it<br/>dissipates real quick cause I stop focusing on it an'<br/>it gets harder to keep it up the further out it is.<br/>But if...if...SHE goes with it...then she can can<br/>keep it up...an'...it'll still be part a me<br/>though...I'll...I'll feeel her all the time...but<br/>maybe she'll leave me alone an not talk to me...at<br/>least she REALLY can't kill me without killin' herself<br/>then though...no lie...its my chi after all.~<p>"Get ready to go," Ranko said hesitantly.<p>"A real body after all this time," the neko-ken said.<br/>Ranko could almost see the grin.<p>********<p>"Is it just me or did it just get hot?" Sheila asked.<br/>They looked to Ranko.<p>Sheila and Brianna flinched as Ranko's hands came<br/>together and a soft white ball of radiance appeared in<br/>her hands. Then Ranko pushed it away from her quickly<br/>and snapped her eyes open, backpedalling from the ball<br/>of light as it took shape. Into a small, blue cat.<p>"Oh, how cute," Sheila said.<p>"This is a slightly small body," the cat said in<br/>Japanese.<p>"What did it say?" she asked.<p>"Small body," Brianna said, a little hesitant.<p>"I said I'd getcha a body," Ranko said, plastered<br/>against the wall. "Didn't say how big. Now could you<br/>just...go over there where I can't see you...or<br/>somethin?"<p>"Most familiars are small," Sheila said. "Though I<br/>get the feeling that this isn't quite a normal<br/>familiar."<p>"Familiar?" Brianna said. "Huh, well...maybe that<br/>works."<p>"GET DOWN!" Ranma shouted from further back in the<br/>tunnel. the three girls glanced toward him in time to<br/>see him fire a blast of chi there way. All of the<br/>them ducked, the blast rolling under them to collide<br/>with a stream of fire that had seemingly come from<br/>nowhere.<p>"Stay down!" Ranko shouted as she realized, from the<br/>suddenly blast of cold air, what sort of chi Ranma had<br/>used.<p>Sheila, not understanding Ranko's instructions tried<br/>to stand up after the energy had passed them,<br/>expecting to get into stance and ready for the fight<br/>before the explosion died down.<p>He had jumped right to the technique he'd killed<br/>Saffron with. As the cold chi hit the fire, the hiryu<br/>shoten ha was made and the small, spear shaped tornado<br/>ripped down the corridor. The backlash threw Sheila<br/>backward toward the coming reinforcements.<p>Three demonic forms of rock and smoke crumbled to dust<br/>as the tornado pierced them. Several others lost<br/>limbs or had their artificial bodies cracked as the<br/>tornado clipped them. Invisibly demonic spirits<br/>rushed down the corridor seeking the pools of magma<br/>further ahead to form a new body from. They found Dr.<br/>Diggers waiting for them.<p>The shock of the released souls slowed down the demons<br/>enough for Akane, Sheila and Nodoka to recover from<br/>the jagwere's impromptu flight. Brianna and Ranko,<br/>meanwhile stood up as Julia Diggers past them in a<br/>blur, Ranma not far behind her. The little blue cat<br/>was no where in sight.<p>"Where did...?" Ranko started, then felt around for<br/>her chi.<p>There, she felt it. The thing had RIDDEN Ranma's<br/>hiryu shoten ha further back into the cavern.<p>It had hurt.<p>Ranko smiled.<p>~Wait a minute,~ Ranko thought. ~What is that?~ She<br/>got a feeling of something, important being in the<br/>area. And reluctantly, squinting her eyes closed,<br/>concentrated on that small piece of her chi.<p>"DIE DIE!" Brianna shouted next to her, laughing<br/>manically and fire burst after burst from her gun.<p>It was a comparatively pleasant counterpoint to the<br/>feline noises going on in her head.<p>********<p>The neko-ken muttered irritably as it shook it's head<br/>out. That girl was actually pleased that this little<br/>plan turned out to be rather painful. She staggered<br/>around for a few moments, shaking her head clear.<p>~Wait a minute,~ the girl thought. ~What is that?~<br/>The cat hissed irritably and momentarily ignored the<br/>question, looking around for prey. It's body was<br/>small, but it was still a powerful spirit with<br/>centuries of experience. Even with the limited energy<br/>it had it could be dangerous.<p>The impulse to look back at whatever sensory blip had<br/>caught her impromptu mistress's attention became a<br/>little stronger. She really should have considered<br/>the ramifications of letting the girl form a body for<br/>her out of personal chi.<p>Of course after so long without a body, most of that<br/>spent as a rather instinctual beast that just wanted<br/>to fight, play, eat, or sleep. Thank goodness it was<br/>now had it's mind so it could attend to higher<br/>concerns.<p>Now where were those demons so she could have a good<br/>fun fight. Then she could lounge in the sun or hunt<br/>for the rest of the day. All of which are much higher<br/>concerns than mere fighting, playing, eating and<br/>sleeping.<p>Oh yeah, the girl wanted her to look over at that<br/>group of people in robes around the fire again.<p>She looked in that direction just as the three rings<br/>of released souls flashed through the cavern. She<br/>recognized that for what it was. When the demon had<br/>touched the shared soul space it had held with Ranko,<br/>she had still been that insane mockery of herself.<br/>Then she had killed the demon and apparently in the<br/>backlash of released spiritual energy had awakened<br/>herself.<p>The fact that she was now in a small outcropping of<br/>some mortal girl's energy made it questionable as to<br/>whether the situation was good or not.<p>She pondered the question over why the girl was<br/>interested in a bunch of undead gathered around a<br/>fire. Then she shook her head out one last time and<br/>realized the fire was a gate.<p>The nearest thing possible to a vicious smile for a<br/>cat crossed the ejected neko-ken's face.<p>********<p>"Ranko!" Genn shouted next to her.<p>Ranko broke her concentration to glance toward the<br/>sound and found herself bowled over by something else<br/>moments before a clawed arm of stone and fire swiped<br/>through her former position.<p>"Are you okay?" Ranma asked as he picked her up. "Ya<br/>look kinda spaced out."<p>"I'm fine," Ranko said shaking him off and getting to<br/>her own feet. "I know where the gate is!" She<br/>shouted.<p>"What gat...hey!" Ranma shouted as Ranko ran off down<br/>the corridor, taking advantage of a brief gap in the<br/>demon's forces.<p>"Don't go off on your own!" Nodoka shouted.<p>"Where is she going?" Brianna demanded sharply at<br/>nearly the same time. The three geared up to follow<br/>her, but found the way suddenly closed shut behind<br/>her. As if the stone had temporarily melted.<p>"Damn it!" Ranma shouted as he approached the now<br/>far to small hole, which soldified as a small shaft<br/>that allowed them to hear what was going on in the<br/>next part of the cavern. Several rings of releashed<br/>souls showed that Dr. Diggers was dealing with the<br/>last batch of demons they whose bodies they had<br/>destroyed.<p>"Akane-chan!" Nodoka said. "You're the only one that<br/>can get through that hole in a timely fashion." Ranma<br/>turned around to look at Nodoka and Akane, looking<br/>torn.<p>"What me?" Akane said, glancing at the narrow hole and<br/>back to Nodoka as if she were crazy. "You've got to<br/>be kidding."<p>"No, she's right," Julia said. "You're a wererat now<br/>in case you forgot, you have two other forms besides<br/>this hybrid one you've been wearing."<p>"None of their spirits escaped me," Dr Diggers said,<br/>coming into the cavern. He immediately noticed they<br/>were lacking one were-cheetah, and the nearly closed<br/>tunnel that hadn't been there when he'd done his<br/>clairvoyant search earlier.<p>"Why can't he just open the tunnel?" Ranma asked. "Or<br/>teleport us?" Dr. Diggers took a moment to<br/>concentrate.<p>"It's warded against teleportation," he said. "And<br/>opening magically created rock will take some time."<br/>Akane sighed.<p>"Does anybody here know somebody that goes by the name<br/>'Rook'?" Genn asked nervously as he stood at the wall.<p>"Rook," the Diggers and Sheila said together.<p>"So how do I change into a rat?" she asked, with a<br/>glance towards Ranma. The male werecheetah looked on<br/>the verge of a nervous explosion.<p>********<p>Ranko skidded to a stop and turned back to see the<br/>corridor behind her shutting closed.<p>"Another werecheetah," a dry voice said. "How<br/>unlikey, and yet appropriate." Ranko turned to see an<br/>armored form wielding a pair of swords staring at her<br/>from behind a group of translucent men and women with<br/>empty eyes in white robes. Her nose wrinkled as she<br/>caught a whiff of the room. Everything in here with<br/>the exception of her and the...n...neko-k..ken were<br/>dead.<p>"Y...yeah," Ranko said, noticing that cat sneaking up<br/>toward the figures around the fire. "Wh..whatever,<br/>just get ready to get yer asses kicked."<p>"I think not," the armored figure said. "Take her,<br/>and make it noisy so her friends can listen." The<br/>translucent figures glided toward her.<p>Ranko smirked and punched out at one of the robed men,<br/>only to have her fist pass through it. A circle kick<br/>met the same results in passing through another two of<br/>her attackers.<p>~Great,~ Ranko thought. The figures clumisly reached<br/>out to grab her, but she stepped back and away from<br/>them, growling as she saw the armored figure walk to<br/>where the tunnel had been.<p>********<p>"Sheila of the Edge Guard," a dry voice said further<br/>down the tunnel. "And young Miss Diggers."<p>~That must be the 'Rook' character they had told me<br/>about,~ Akane thought, reviewing what they had said<br/>about his armor and tactics. A crashing sound behind<br/>her spurred her along. Sure Dr. Diggers had said he'd<br/>watch her and make sure she was far enough away before<br/>they started demolitions, but still.<p>"I wouldn't bother with that," Rook laughed. "By the<br/>time you can get through she'll be dead...or perhaps<br/>undead...a werecat specter to do my bidding."<p>"We'll see about that, jerk," Akane said, her voice<br/>coming out as a small squeak. Further back she had a<br/>call of "Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken" and knew that<br/>Ranma had heard and gotten angry as well.<p>********<p>If that c...c...cat wanted to protect her, where was<br/>it now. Ranko glanced around as she continued to<br/>dodge mindless, groping hands from the specters.<p>Her question was answered a flash of blue leaped past<br/>and slashed at one of the specters. Great ripping<br/>tears opened in the translucent image before the<br/>specter seemed to be blown away, as if it had been<br/>nothing but a pile of leaves seemlessly joined. Ranko<br/>swore that a look of peace crossed the things face<br/>before it vanished completely<p>"NO!" Ranko snapped. "Don't kil..."<p>"But they're already dead," the Neko-ken retorted.<p>"They are?" Ranko asked, then smacked herself in the<br/>head, backing away again. That armored jerk was still<br/>just watching. "Duh, ghosts." And the thing<br/>certainly had seem peaceful before leaving...she just<br/>wished she had another way to do this.<p>Another of the five ghosts was torn to pieces by the<br/>little blue cat, which was emitting an impressive<br/>amount of energy for something it's size. Especially<br/>since Ranko was sure that she hadn't given it that<br/>much.<p>"Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken!" Ranko shouted, she kept<br/>the speed lower than normal however, hoping to<br/>disguise her true capabilities from the knight.<br/>Still, combining even a minimal Kachuu Tenshin<br/>Amaguriken with her cheetah speed was phenomanal and<br/>the chi charged attacks ripped through the remaining<br/>specters.<p>A low applauding greeted her display.<p>"It seems that I shall have to take care of you<br/>myself," Rook said, drawing forth his swords and<br/>moving in to attack.<p>"You're dead too, aintcha?" Ranko asked irritably.<p>"Doesn't really matter," Rook said. "You'll not<br/>defeat me anyway."<p>"We'll see about that," Ranko said. ~I'm going to get<br/>this one on my own. No help! Just me! I can do just<br/>as well as Ranma can.~ She launched forward into a<br/>charge, a loud boom rocking the chamber and blowing<br/>over the fire gate as she crossed the sound barrier.<br/>And all it would take her was one attack.<p>"KACHUU TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN!" She shouted and<br/>snapped an energy shrouded fist forward at the chi<br/>created speeds. She felt four impacts in the first<br/>instant of contact and then her target was gone in a<br/>puff of smoke. She blinked, confused. "That's it?"<p>She had just about put every remaining once of chi<br/>into that Amaguriken and it only took four hits. What<br/>if he hadn't been dead before, had she just killed<br/>someone? Was she that shallow, that the first chance<br/>she had to compare herself to Ranma that she ignored<br/>her earlier decisions?<p>Then again it had always been like that. She never<br/>did more than cursory training, unless there was a<br/>fight brewing that she had to take care of. She spent<br/>all her time scamming ice cream. The only time she<br/>got serious into the Art was when she had to or<br/>someone suggested she was weaker than Ranma. Or<br/>rather, remembering that her memories were artificial,<br/>the only time Ranma trained his girl side was when he<br/>had to.<p>"Look out, girl!" her cat hissed, promoting a wince,<br/>but Ranko did turn in time to see a flash of metal<br/>descend towards her. She raised her arm to catch the<br/>blade on the flat and deflect it aside.<p>"AAAIEEEE!" Ranko shrieked as her flesh connected<br/>with the silvered sword. She only barely dodged aside<br/>from the other strike, clutching her burned hand.<p>"That was impressive speed, child," Rook said<br/>advancing on her as she backed away. "You actually<br/>beat the teleportation. Four times, I wonder how many<br/>hits I would have taken had I remained where I was<br/>standing."<p>"Teleportation?" Ranko repeated. She stepped forward<br/>and snapped a short kick at Rook, blinking as the<br/>specter vanished into dust before the unenhanced kick<br/>could reach him. Almost instantly she felt him<br/>reappearing behind and struck out again with a mule<br/>kick.<p>She glanced back as she did so and noted, with dismay,<br/>that the armored jerk vanished into smoke again as she<br/>kicked out. A flash of motion above her alerted her<br/>to where the monster was appearing.<p>In mid air, right over her horizontal back.<p>Ranko leaped up off the one leg connected on the<br/>ground and rolled past the descending Rook. Seeing<br/>the neko-ken launch itself forward in a small blue<br/>ball of fury confirmed her suspicion as Rook<br/>teleported immediately behind the cat to avoid the<br/>strike.<p>What she needed was an attack to cover a radius around<br/>her. Unfortunately she had blown all her remaining<br/>chi and was even now just operating on fumes.<p>Ranko landed shakily and examined the silver burn on<br/>her arm again. That arm wasn't going to be much use<br/>in the battle. She glanced up seeing her "familiar"<br/>as Sheila had called the damn neko-ken, sent flying<br/>against a wall before hitting the ground, momentarily<br/>stunned. The sight brought a small smile to Ranko's<br/>face, even as she stepped away from the cat.<p>The armored figure advanced on her, she swore it was<br/>smiling under that helmet, as she tried to catch her<br/>breath. Ranko took a shaky stance, feeling some of<br/>her chi return courtesy of her capability to<br/>regenerate.<p>"At least I closed the gate," Ranko said.<p>"It can be reopened," Rook assured her.<p>He slashed forward with one sword and another, forcing<br/>Ranko to dodge back while she was considering a way to<br/>beat that telepotation of his. She had to find a way<br/>to get him without him knowing she was striking, that<br/>was the only way. Then he wouldn't know to teleport.<p>Her back hit the wall and immediately Rook rolled<br/>around to her side, giving her a shot to the middle of<br/>the room.<p>"Almost had me cornered there," Ranko said. "Maybe<br/>you're not as good as I think." She smirked. Rook<br/>did not answer, having learned much earlier that walls<br/>where dangerous things for him to fight near.<p>"Ranko!" Akane shouted, from inside the cavern. The<br/>armored creature stopped and turned to face the sound.<p>"How surprising," he said, looking over The newly<br/>appeared wererat. "How did you get in here?" The<br/>sound of digging magic and warriors could be heard<br/>getting closer, but the tunnel was still solid on this<br/>end.<p>~Thank you, Akane,~ Ranko said, launching an attack<br/>forward at the distracted Rook.<p>Of course, Ranko had made the same mistake Julia had<br/>in her first confrontation with Rook. It wasn't Rook<br/>doing the teleporting...it was the armor. Rook<br/>vanished before Ranko's fist could get there.<p>"Ranko duck!" Akane shouted, running forward. Ranko<br/>didn't need to be told twice as she rolled forward,<br/>the cleaving slash becoming only a painful burning<br/>across her back. "You monster!"<p>"Don't think that you can beat me, little rat," Rook<br/>said. "I can already tell you're not as skilled<br/>as..." Rook was cut short as Akane leaped into a<br/>jump kick, back to the ground. Rook had a fraction of<br/>a second to realize what was happening before he was<br/>stuck in solid rock...again.<p>"Ranko are you okay?" Akane asked rushing to the side<br/>of her the werecheetah. Ranko sat up, trying to<br/>ignore the burning sensations on her back and arm.<br/>She looked from Akane to where Rook was stuck in the<br/>ground, hands and feet sticking out comically.<p>"You rescued me," Ranko said hollowly.<p>"Of course I did," Akane snapped in her usual annoyed<br/>voice. "Why did you do something as stupid as run off<br/>by yourself...anyway?" Akane's concerned anger faded<br/>as Ranko's eyes began to grow misty.<p>"YOU rescued ME," Ranko repeated, before the fatigue,<br/>stress and humiliation finally cracked her Soul of Ice<br/>and she broke out into a gale of weeping.<p>"Oh," Akane said, reaching forward to hug the girl.<br/>"You'd have beaten him eventually." She assured<br/>Ranko, not sure whether the girl was hearing her or<br/>not.<p>The final sound of the others breaking through the<br/>rock echoed through the final cavern as Akane held<br/>Ranko in what she hoped was a comforting hug, avoiding<br/>the nasty looking burns on her back and arm as much as<br/>she could.<p>"Is she okay?" Ranma demanded as he came in. "Are you<br/>okay?"<p>"OH!" Nodoka said coming over and seeiing the burns.<br/>"These will have to be treated!"<p>"Missed all the fun," Brianna muttered to herself.<br/>She glanced over to Ranko and her family comforting<br/>her, hoping it was a comfort and not a humiliation and<br/>then walked with Sheila and her mother to where Rook<br/>was trapped in stone.<p>"This time why don't we cut him out and lock him in a<br/>vault or something?" Sheila asked.<p>"A heavily warded vault," Julia agreed.<p>"With a Diggers anti-magic field set up around the<br/>stone," Brianna finished.<p>"This time he's NOT coming back," Sheila finished.<p>Meanwhile the small, blue, as yet unnamed cat, unless<br/>one considers "Neko-Ken" a name, finally sat up and<br/>shook it's head clear. It was a spirit of thunder and<br/>lightning, but really, there was such a thing as too<br/>much of a good thing. Besides the thunder and<br/>lightning in it's eyes and ears at the moment was more<br/>of a concussion thing.<p>"Oh, that was fun," she said. "But wait until I learn<br/>this little body some more."<p>********<p>Things were much quieter later in the day, when they'd<br/>returned to the inn.<p>"She put the neko-ken into a seperate body without<br/>using the familiar ritual," Dr. Diggers said.<br/>"Without even knowing the ritual. That is<br/>impressive." Julia nodded.<p>"You're thinking of asking her or Ranma to see if<br/>they're interested in learning magic?" Julia asked.<br/>The mage looked to her and she smiled. "You can't<br/>resist a talented student any more than I can."<p>"I highly doubt that Ranma would like to study more<br/>magic than it would take to duplicate his sister's<br/>act," Theo said. "I assume Ranko would be along the<br/>lines of her brother as well."<p>"That would be a bad assumption to make Theo," Julia<br/>said. "Think about Brianna." The mage nodded.<p>"I'll suggest it," he said. "We'll see what she<br/>thinks. After we talk to her mother."<p>********<p>Ranko looked down at her arm, Dr. Diggers had healed<br/>it, but she could still remember the feel of her soul<br/>being charred where the silver had touched it. That<br/>wasn't what bothered her though. Akane, Ranma and her<br/>mother had stayed with her in the room for an hour<br/>before she asked them to leave her alone. They had<br/>only left reluctantly.<p>They were worried about her, it was touching. But it<br/>was humiliating.<p>And the Neko-ken was still hanging around her to.<br/>Every time it came close she started getting the<br/>shivers. At the moment she thought it was basking in<br/>the sun far away from her. She could feel warmth<br/>spreading evenly over that piece of her chi.<p>"Want to talk about it?" someone asked from the door.<br/>Ranko turned morosely and saw Brianna standing there.<p>"No," Ranko said.<p>"Too bad," Brianna said. "Because you're going to."<p>Brianna walked over and sat down next to Ranko. Ranko<br/>blinked as she first realized just how large she was<br/>in her hybrid form, even Brianna, who would dwarf her<br/>human form, looked rather small next to her.<p>"What's to talk about?" Ranko asked. "All I was<br/>useful for was getting my ass kicked and shaking like<br/>a scaredy...dog."<p>"YOU found the gate," Brianna reminded her. "YOU took<br/>it out of commission. I'd say that you weren't<br/>exactly useless."<p>"AKANE had to rescue me," Ranko said. "She ain't<br/>bad...but...usually its me doin' the rescuing...or<br/>Ranma anyway."<p>"Yeah, well we told her what to do before she went<br/>into the room," Brianna said. "That idiot Rook<br/>depends on that one trick way too much."<p>"That one trick almost killed me," Ranko said. "And<br/>to think, if I had done just a single jab when I'd hit<br/>that wall..."<p>"Yeah," Brianna said. "That's how Mom finally beat<br/>him, he had her fooled to, almost killed her...thenl<br/>he TOLD her how his armor works." She rolled her eyes<br/>at the idiocy of that. "I guess he learned his lessen<br/>about bragging from that."<p>"He almost beat your mother?" Ranko said, somewhat<br/>surprised and impressed.<p>"Yeah," Brianna said. "But it's because of that one<br/>trick of his, and now we all know how to beat him."<p>"Ranma would have beat him," Ranko said. "He's better<br/>than me."<p>"Don't try to compare yourself to him," Brianna said.<br/>"You'll always be in his shadow then. You remember<br/>what I told you about Grave Digger?"<p>"That was before I existed," Ranko reminded her,<br/>without denying that she remembered.<p>"Yeah," Brianna said. "Well anyway, the same thing<br/>applies here I think. You think I could beat Brit in<br/>a fight?" Ranko considered this and shook her head<br/>slowly.<p>"No," she said hesitantly.<p>"And do you think I could out research Gina?" At this<br/>Ranko held just a blank expression, both of the<br/>Diggers genuises were so far beyond her in technical<br/>knowledge that she could hardly tell their levels<br/>apart. "Well it depends. With my inventions, I'm<br/>probably an even match for Brit, maybe more so, Brit<br/>doesn't do much serious training. And next to Gina,<br/>for pure raw intellect and talent, she's head and<br/>shoulders above me, but I find things she misses all<br/>the time. She makes things too complicated for<br/>herself. And when you put me all together I'm<br/>probably the top military mind of the Diggers set. I<br/>do my own thing, I don't try to do my sisters'<br/>things."<p>"All I know is martial arts," Ranko said. "All I know<br/>is what HE'S been taught."<p>"Are you interested in martial arts?" Brianna asked,<br/>remembering her half-muttered comment before the shit<br/>had started hitting the fan earlier.<p>"Not really," Ranko answered after a long pause.<br/>"But...what else?"<p>"I'm sure you'll find something," Brianna said<br/>comfortingly. "Hey, most kids your age don't know<br/>what they're going to do."<p>"Most kids my age are still in the hospital," Ranko<br/>muttered darkly.<p>"Yeah," Brianna said. "And most my age have yet to<br/>hit kindergarten, so anyway...I got to go meet the<br/>other girls. We're going shopping with the bounty<br/>money for Rook if you want to come."<p>"Maybe," Ranko said.<p>"We'll wait downstairs for a little while," Brianna<br/>said. "Don't mope it'll make you feel worse."<p>********<p>"...and then he asks me 'if that wasn't sex what was<br/>it,'" Akane said.<p>"No," Sheila said. "He's that clueless?"<p>"He's that clueless," Genn agreed as Akane nodded.<p>"All this time I've been calling him a pervert," Akane<br/>said, rolling her eyes. "And he doesn't even know<br/>what it is."<p>"Did I miss anything?" Brianna asked as she came to<br/>join them.<p>"Just some girl talk," Sheila said. She gestured to<br/>Ranma surreptitiously, where the werecheetah was<br/>sitting in the corner watching them nervously.<br/>"Apparently Akane fell asleep on top of him and he<br/>thought that was sex."<p>"REALLY?" Brianna said. "No way!"<p>"Yep," Akane said. "That's what happened." Brianna<br/>glanced over at Ranma, whose face was turning red as<br/>he realized that they were talking about him.<p>"Wow," Brianna said. "Lucky girl, you get to break<br/>him in to all the wonderful little secrets of...life<br/>without anybody screwing it up before hand."<p>"Errr...I guess," Akane said. Genn leaned over and<br/>whispered.<p>"By reports you're not interested in Ranma," Brianna<br/>said knowingly.<p>"I'm not!" Akane said, flustered, turning bright red<br/>and glancing around nervously. "Wait a minute, by<br/>what reports?"<p>"That samurai, and the chef," Brianna said smiling.<p>"Kuno!" Akane blinked. "He's insane. And Ukyou<br/>can't stand to admit that the only thing Ranma sees in<br/>her is a brother or sister."<p>"But you're not interested," Sheila said. "And you're<br/>talking about his cluelessness with sex." Akane<br/>looked around like a caged rat, appropriately enough<br/>and then relented.<p>"Fine," Akane said. "I like him. There happy?"<p>"Almost," Brianna said leaning forward. "So, how does<br/>he make you feel?"<p>"I don't know," Akane said, twiddling her fingers<br/>somewhat. "I feel...safe around him and well, in<br/>danger at the same time. And now..."<p>"Now?" the other three said simultaneously. They all<br/>leaned forward.<p>"I keep having these fantasies about tall grass and<br/>running," Akane said. "From something that wants to<br/>devour me...and I WANT to get caught."<p>"Mmmm," Brianna said eyes glazing a little.<p>"Must be the whole predator-prey thing," Sheila said.<br/>"I wonder how it would feel to date something that<br/>would instinctually hunt you."<p>"Hmmph," Akane said. "Ranma only does the hunting in<br/>the fantasies, I have to do it in real life. He<br/>freaks if you flirt with him." She immediately<br/>blushed at that admission.<p>"Well, that's just the proper way to do it," Sheila<br/>said. "As long as they believe that THEY'RE the ones<br/>doing the hunting anyway."<p>"Devour me...heh...heh..."<p>All eyes turned slowly toward Brianna.<p>"Brianna is a little..." Genn started, leaning over<br/>to whisper to Akane.<p>"Sex-crazed," Sheila finished.<p>"I am not sex-crazed," Brianna said. "I just LIKE it<br/>that's all."<p>"If you were male you'd look surprisingly like Tirga,"<br/>Sheila said.<p>"Hey," Brianna said. "I'm not a two-timing<br/>arm-dragger like him. What do you see in him anyway,<br/>Sheila?"<p>"Tirga is the pervert that hit on me in my room<br/>right?" Akane asked. "The tiger guy."<p>"That's him," Sheila said dryly, eyes narrowed.<p>"What DO you see in him?" Akane asked.<p>"Other than the obvious, of course," Brianna said,<br/>licking her lips. "If you weren't set on him I'd give<br/>him a quick try."<p>"That two-timing, arm-dragger?" Genn repeated.<p>"Hey, he's a good looking two-timing arm-dragger,"<br/>Brianna said. "Besides being used and abandoned might<br/>be good for him. What goes around comes around you<br/>know."<p>"You are bizarre," Akane said, arching her eyebrows.<p>"You don't know the half of it," Genn muttered.<p>"Tirga has his good points," Sheila said finally.<br/>"He's a creditable member of the Edge Guard."<p>"Okay," Brianna said. "Outside his reported skill in<br/>the sack, that body, and his ability in a fight, what<br/>are his good points?"<p>"Actually," Sheila said. "He's the only one that<br/>reports his skill in the sack."<p>"Wait a minute, didn't you and he have a fling or<br/>something?' Brianna asked. "Wouldn't you know?"<p>"That was Genn actually," Sheila said, gesturing to<br/>the Rakshasha. Akane looked from the Rakshasha to<br/>Sheila and looked confused until she remembered that<br/>the little creature was a shapechanger.<p>"Oh," Akane said. "Replacement pervert."<p>"I am not a pervert," Genn protested.<p>"You slept with Kodachi," Akane said.<p>"And paid for it greatly," Genn muttered.<p>"With Kodachi, you haven't even begun to pay for it,"<br/>Akane said.<p>"Great," Genn said.<p>"Who's Kodachi?" Sheila asked.<p>"Someone from Akane's home town," Brianna said. "Some<br/>rich girl with a strange laugh and a thing for whips."<p>"Oooo," Sheila said. "Lucky boy, Genn." The<br/>Rakshasha twitched.<p>"Hey," Brianna said. "Isn't that Gar over there?"<p>"Oh yeah," Sheila said, standing up and waving.<br/>"Thropan and Onoli too." The three were-cats noticed<br/>Sheila waving and started over.<p>"I guess the girl-talk is over for now," Brianna said.<br/>Then she noticed Ranko coming down the stairs, and<br/>sighed in relief. At least for a moment<p>"Oh, is Ranko coming with us?" Akane asked, noticing<br/>the girl as well. Then it happened.<p>"Uh oh," Sheila and Genn added.<p>********<p>Ranko grumbled to herself as she came down the stairs<br/>and started to work her way through the crowd toward<br/>where Sheila was waving. The jagwere must of just<br/>caught a flash of her or something, because she was<br/>looking in the wrong way. Whatever, at least she knew<br/>where to go to meet them in this restaurant-inn<br/>thingie.<p>She was about half way there when she felt some one<br/>slam into her from behind and to the side. She would<br/>have fallen right then if whoever had bumped her had<br/>not grabbed her and pulled her up.<p>"Oh sorry about that," a voice said behind her. "I<br/>didn't see you..." The voice trailed off for a moment<br/>while Ranko looked down to where her "rescuer's" hands<br/>were placed. "Something wrong?"<p>"Gar," another voice said, hesitantly. "Hands."<p>"What about...wait a minute," Gar made the mistake of<br/>experimentally squeezing, which had the effect of<br/>snapping Ranko out of her shock.<p>********<p>"Is it fair to suggest," Brianna asked. "That if<br/>Ranma is as clueless and intimidated by sex as you<br/>say, then Ranko..."<p>********<p>"PERVERT!" Ranko shouted flipping around and almost<br/>faltering when she saw the werecat. The punch did not<br/>land with as much force as it would have as a result.<br/>Therefore, Gar only flew back fifteen feet. As Gar<br/>flew, so did Ranko, in a manner of speaking.<p>********<p>"Yep," Sheila said, wincing as her brother landed.<br/>"It's fair to assume."<p>"Th...th...that...c...c..cat groped me!" Ranko<br/>gasped, virtually appearing behind Akane.<p>"That's my brother, Gar," Sheila said.<p>"He's a pervert!" Ranko snapped.<p>"That's a pervert," Sheila said, pointing toward<br/>Brianna.<p>"Hey!" Bri protested.<p>"Gar's just male," Sheila said.<p>"Yeah," Ranko said. "A pervert. Right?'<p>"Right," Akane added. Both Nerimans nodded in eerie<br/>unison. "Except for Ryouga anyway." Ranko twitched.<br/>Then a were-lion approached their table, and he stood<br/>taller than all of them.<p>"We apologize for that incident," the lion said. "Gar<br/>did not mean to...do that. He was just trying to save<br/>her from the fall."<p>"Yeah, Onoli, we saw the whole thing," Sheila said.<br/>"Including the last little squeeze."<p>"Errr," Onoli said nervously. As Thropan guided a<br/>dizzy Gar to the women's table. Tirga, in human form,<br/>appeared next to Onoli then and started putting his<br/>two cents in.<p>"Well, can you blame him?" Tirga asked. "I mean she<br/>is one hot little lady, almost as tall as Britanny,<br/>slimmer build with just a trace of red in her fur.<br/>Hot, man!"<p>"Could you all go away please?" Ranko asked, still<br/>hiding behind Akane.<p>Akane would protect her. Akane was She Who Shooed<br/>Away Cats. She always had been. The fact that she<br/>had been in a deep depression because Akane had<br/>rescued her earlier did not register...after<br/>all...these were CATS.<p>"Why are you in human form?" Thropan asked Tirga as<br/>they reached the table.<p>"Because she's afraid of cats," Tirga answered<br/>pointing to the werecheetah crouching behind the<br/>wererat. "So if I'm gonna get in tight with..." The<br/>girls cleared their throats.<p>"This is not a wise thing to be saying," Sheila said.<p>"Uh...heh," Tirga said, which was about when he was<br/>pulled over and found himself staring into the glaring<br/>eyes of the other werecheetah.<p>"What was that about getting in tight with my sister?"<br/>Ranma asked. Tirga smirked and shifted into his tiger<br/>form.<p>"Meow," he said, smirking. Ranma vanished and joined<br/>his sister behind Akane. "Heh, funny kid."<p>"Oh for Pete's sake," Akane said standing up from her<br/>chair and walking over to Tirga.<p>"Oh hi," Tirga said. "Rethinking my offer from<br/>earlier?"<p>"Should we do anything?" Thropan asked.<p>"She looks a little smaller than Sheila," Onoli said<br/>in response. "There shouldn't be much problem."<br/>While it was true that switching to her hybrid form<br/>resulted in a minor loss of mass for Akane, it was<br/>still obvious that the Edge Guard had not yet<br/>encountered the Wrath of Akane. Except for Tirga, but<br/>as for him.<p>"Like I said," Sheila sighed. "Too stupid to be a<br/>threat."<p>"HEY!" Tirga snapped. He was about to protest<br/>further, but then Akane grabbed him. A few seconds<br/>later Akane was walking back to her seat and dusting<br/>off her hands.<p>"Really," Akane said.<p>"Trip to the healer's," Thropan said, looking down at<br/>Tirga. Ranko and Ranma were applauding her and<br/>quoting Dr. Tofu from a year or so ago.<p>"See how that joint's bent backwards?" Ranma asked.<p>"That's Akane's touch alright," Ranko finished.<p>********<p>The helicopter, heavily modified by a combination of<br/>Ace, Penny, Brianna and Gina's talents, touched down<br/>on the ground in Japan lightly and easily. As the<br/>engines shut down the passengers and crew, meaning<br/>Ace, immediately disembarked to be met by a tall,<br/>buxoum werecheetah.<p>"MUFFIN!" Britanny shouted crossing the distance<br/>quickly to hug her husband. "It's been ages!"<p>"It's been two days," Konatsu said. Britanny turned a<br/>smoky glance toward the ninja's direction.<p>"Exactly," she said. Stripe rolled his eyes in<br/>amusement.<p>"Where's Gina?" Penny asked.<p>"She's just a little behind me," Britanny said,<br/>pointing back to where her sister was standing up<br/>after the backdraft of her the werecheetah's<br/>departure.<p>Gina was dusting herself off as she approached.<p>"Warn me next time," Gina said as she caught up, then<br/>looked to Lydia lying asleep on the stretcher. "What<br/>happened to her? She should be awake."<p>"We had some magical interference," Penny said. "Is<br/>your father around?"<p>"Nope," Gina said. "He's in Jade, not sure when he's<br/>coming back just yet. Is this the girl?" She pointed<br/>to Yuka.<p>"Uh, hello," Yuka said, watching Brittany nervously.<p>"Hi," Gina said. "Don't worry, as soon as my dad's<br/>back we'll have you back to your old self." Penny<br/>cleared her throat and pulled Gina to the side.<p>"She might have it by heredity," Penny said. "Some of<br/>her family comes from Africa, and we think that<br/>necklace of hers is what caused your rat friend to<br/>keep sleeping."<p>"Any reason you're giving me the rundown so quick?"<br/>Gina asked, she glanced to Ace and smirked. Penny's<br/>eye twitched.<p>"I want to get back to my date," Penny said tightly.<br/>"Is there anything else you need my help for?"<p>"Not at the moment," Gina said.<p>"Then Ace and I are gone," Penny said. "Call me in a<br/>few hours for more details. Good luck, Gina."<p>"Thanks, Penny, I'll do that," Gina waved as the other<br/>genius turned to head back for the helicopter.<p>"Yo, G, stay safe," Ace called out as he helped Penny<br/>board the plane. ~As if any warning has ever done you<br/>any good before.~<p>"You too Ace," Gina called out.<p>********<p>Something, a snake, loomed over a little cat girl who<br/>was staring dazedly ahead. They were across a wide<br/>field from her. The little girl seemed familiar.<p>"Hey!" a voice shouted, and Lydia felt the scene zoom<br/>forward with great speed until she was seeing the<br/>snake up close. "Stay away from my sister."<p>"You sssister is mine, cat," the snake hissed sliding<br/>back. "Already the poison runs through her veins.<br/>She will be filled with anger and hate and a thirst<br/>for blood...and be my servant."<p>The view rocked dramatically until Lydia could see two<br/>small bleeding wounds on the little girl's hand. A<br/>furred hand, maybe fourteen years old, snatched out<br/>and grabbed the dazed girl's hand. Another furred<br/>hand covered the first, and a flash of white passed<br/>into the little girl's body. She felt the contact and<br/>the flash of power, almost as if they were her hands.<p>"Your poison is gone, Set," the voice yelled again.<br/>It was somewhere close, just off camera, but Lydia<br/>couldn't connect it to anything. "Be gone before I<br/>send you away."<p>"Godling, you cannot fight me," the angry snake<br/>hissed. It started to slither forward, and Lydia felt<br/>something like a cringing and a repressed fear as<br/>those two arms encircled the little girl, who was<br/>coming out of her trance.<p>A steel blade sliced downward, narrowly missing the<br/>dodging serpant. The scene shifted up to see a<br/>jackal-headed man weilding a polearm with two<br/>semi-circular blades.<p>"Begone, serpent of darkness," the jackal barked.<p>"This is not over, little cat," the snake hissed as it<br/>fled. The jackal bent down to observe the wound on<br/>the girl's hand.<p>"There is no hate," he muttered. "But rage will<br/>always be a part of her now."<p>"Not always," the voice said. The scene flashed to<br/>darkness.<p>********<p>Another scene flashed into view. Cats, cats,<br/>everywhere. As far as she could see in the huge room.<br/>All lounging about or playing, or hunting, or looking<br/>at her. She felt herself standing up and walking, and<br/>the cats parted before her. A pair of lions bowed as<br/>she passed them.<p>"Going out again?" a woman's voice asked. She<br/>recognized it as Sehkmet.<p>"I'm not only one of the Eyes of Ra," another voice<br/>said. It was close, but Lydia could not see where it<br/>had come from. "I have other...duties..."<p>"If you can call what you do a duty," Sehkmet<br/>muttered. "I'm surprised you don't try to lay me."<p>"Now sister," that other voice said. "I am not a<br/>pervert. Leave that incestuous stuff to the<br/>Olympians."<p>"I do," Sehkmet said tightly, controlled. "Thank<br/>you."<p>"Certainly you'll find someone eventually sister," the<br/>voice said.<p>"Not as long as these are still here," Sehkmet pointed<br/>to the wrap around her hand. "They half think I'm a<br/>spy for Set."<p>"You aren't," the voice said. "And that will be<br/>obvious, when we have flayed the serpent alive." A<br/>pleased smile adorned Sehkmet's face, and the scene<br/>flashed back to darkness.<p>********<p>The scene flashed onto the aftermath of a battle.<br/>Sehkmet and was standing near the edge of Lydia's<br/>view, in full battle gear. She herself felt heavy and<br/>weighed down slightly, and as the view moved the sound<br/>of steel on steel could be heard.<p>An open toed boot, revealling clawed toes, kicked at<br/>the body of a huge serpent.<p>"He's dead, sister," the same voice said happily.<br/>"The damn snake is dead. We can live in peace now."<br/>Sehkmet was looking at her hand, momentarily<br/>unwrapped.<p>"The scars aren't gone," she said. The view shifted<br/>and a gauntleted hand took Sehkmet's own and examined<br/>the two bald marks where a snake had bitten a little<br/>girl long ago.<p>"That's just your body," the voice said. "The anger<br/>will go away if you let it." The scene flashed to<br/>dark.<p>********<p>Another scene. Only she saw it in flashes, as if<br/>opening her eyes only for blinks and shutting them<br/>again<p>This time Lydia felt, or was it remembered, great<br/>pain. There was a lot of heavy breathing, and she<br/>could smell a number of people, cat-people surrounding<br/>her. The words were garbled through the pain, until<br/>at last it ended and she felt merely exhausted.<p>A cloth wrapped child was soon taking up the view of<br/>her dream.<p>"Ailuros," the same woman's voice declared softly<br/>before the scene faded to black.<p>********<p>Another scene, the building with the cats again. A<br/>little cheetah girl ran through the room, playing and<br/>laughing.<p>"Ailuros is so quick," the unnamed voice said happily.<p>********<p>"We have to do something," Ailuros declared, she<br/>seemed older now and familiar somehow. "These are<br/>cats, mother, surely you can do something."<p>"It is a mortal's war," the voice said reluctantly.<br/>"We have no reign to do anything while this wizard<br/>holds to mortals."<p>"But he's using them as assassins and slaves," Ailuros<br/>protested.<p>"Do you think I DON'T know that?" the voice demanded.<br/>"He has not yet done anything that we can use to<br/>interfere yet."<p>"But..." Ailuros said. Sehkmet barged into view.<p>"Iceron has declared himself the God of all Cats," she<br/>said angrily. Lydia could almost feel a small smile<br/>appear on the unseen speakers face.<p>"Daughter, sister," the voice said. "Get your gear.<br/>We're going to war."<p>********<p>Another scene. It came in isolated flashes and she<br/>could only catch parts of it.<p>"DIE FIENDISH MORTAL!" Sehkmet charging forward.<p>"These are the deities of Egypt?" aaccompanied by a<br/>low, arrogant laugh.<p>"YOU WILL FALL!" It was that same voice from<br/>before.<p>Fear followed as the spectral image of a great serpent<br/>was printed against the blackness between flashes of<br/>battle.<p>"Let go of my mother!" "No Ailuros! Stay back!"<p>"The cub seeks to defend the mother," the arrogant<br/>wizard said. There was a flash of black fire and<br/>screaming that Lydia almost felt as if it were her<br/>own.<p>"Sist...!"<p>Then there was darkness and flashes of pain and fire<br/>running through her, body and soul, as something tore<br/>at her, and dragged her down. Seeking to devour her,<br/>destroy her. And then that force was shattered and<br/>almost released her with a roar of rage and pain.<p>"Sehkmet," the voice said. "You did it..." And the<br/>scene flashed closed.<p>********<p>Time uncountable followed, tethered in the darkness,<br/>racked with pain and sorrow. This was not the<br/>promised afterlife, this was something else. Sehkmet<br/>had defeated the wizard after her fall, but she had<br/>apparently not killed him.<p>Darkness and pain remained until light flashed.<p>********<p>Lydia snapped awake with gasp and looked around the<br/>room. Three werecheetahs, that's all that registered<br/>at first. Then she started to notice the others in<br/>the room.<p>"Oh shit," she muttered. "I should have stayed with<br/>the #$#$ed up dreams."<p>"Miss McKracken, I presume," Gina Diggers said as all<br/>eyes turned toward her.<p>Someone said something in Japanese with a relieved<br/>tone of voice. To her surprise, a white-furred<br/>wererat came into the room and began serving everyone<br/>tea. Oddly enough, everyone seemed to come to<br/>attention when she entered the room, and even Lydia<br/>felt an odd desire to never say another single swear<br/>word in her life.<p>"What's going on?" she asked.<p>"They want us to help rescue her sister from<br/>Gothwrain," Moisha said, pointing to the wererat.<p>"Eh?" Lydia repeated. Rescue a RAT from Gothwrain?<p>********<p>Gothwrain smiled as night fell and he prepared to<br/>attempt to lay the trap in the Tendo girl's mind<br/>again. He sat down and centered himself before<br/>casting the spell. The girl had some truly impressive<br/>natural defenses, she could have been an exceptional<br/>mage. Gothwrain had other ideas, however, and he had<br/>no intention of giving Nabiki the training she would<br/>find so very useful in the next few moments.<p>He cast the spell and let it seek his target. Again<br/>there was that instant reaction of being forced out.<br/>This time, however, he was ready for the primitive<br/>reaction and merely pushed back harder. Nabiki's<br/>outer defenses caved quickly. After pushing the spell<br/>past Nabiki's outer defenses he pulled back letting<br/>the spell do its work.<p>He took a heavy breath and glanced to the screen that<br/>showed Miss Tendo sleeping a little restlessly.<p>********<p>Nabiki gritted her teeth at the pain as she felt<br/>Gothwrain push his spell into her mind. She<br/>concentrated on keeping her cool and appearing to be<br/>asleep and merely the recipient of a bad dream. She<br/>concentrated on paying attention to what happened as<br/>the spell worked it's way deeper into her mind.<p>~What are you doing to me?~ her thoughts demanded as<br/>she began to feel herself thinking differently.<p>The spell was a simple one, designed to implant only a<br/>few impulses into her mind, unnoticed as she slept<br/>through what should have been a highly unpleasant<br/>nightmare. As the impulses began to arrise on the<br/>surface, she was bolstered by the fact that she was<br/>awake and knew there was a spell in effect. Still she<br/>could only identify with certainty a few of the<br/>imposed thought patterns.<p>The first impulse backfired spectacularly. Nabiki<br/>felt herself acquire a sudden respect for and loyalty<br/>to Gothwrain, for all of half a second. When respect<br/>and loyalty flared into outraged betrayal and bitter<br/>hatred as she considered what the "Lord High Elder"<br/>was still doing to her. Still, she could put on a<br/>false face for her captor and put on a good show. She<br/>just had to make sure she didn't go overboard.<p>The second thought she identified was equally easy to<br/>identify, but harder to fight. She was already a<br/>little afraid of the werecheetahs and their obvious<br/>power. She felt that fear rise to irrational levels<br/>quickly, and could barely keep it in check despite<br/>knowing it was being forced on to her. After that,<br/>she was too exhausted to notice anything else going on<br/>and fell back unconscious.<p>********<p>"Funny that they'd build such large air vents in this<br/>place," Romeo thought. "Maybe we got this base from<br/>someone else." He ceased his wondering as he came to<br/>the end of his search and looked down into the room.<p>There she was, Nabiki Tendo. And she looked to be in<br/>terrible shape. That didn't make any sense whatsoever<br/>though. Gothwrain was here to protect rats, not hurt<br/>them. Maybe there was a reason for it that he didn't<br/>know.<p>He rolled his eyes. Of course there was a reason he<br/>didn't know, but was it a good reason?<p>"It's clan business," Romeo said, hesitating.<p>He only had about five minutes left before he had to<br/>be back in his own room. Besides, there were cameras,<br/>he couldn't hope to get to her without being seen.<br/>Unless...<p>"Maybe she's sick or something," Romeo thought. "Not<br/>injured. I could just check and see. If this works."<p>He played with the vent blades until he could slip out<br/>and clinged desperately to the ceiling in a manner<br/>similar to what Zero had taught him. Had he been<br/>human or hybrid, it would have been impossible, but<br/>apparently, as a rat he could do a creditable<br/>imitation of spider-man.<p>"Spider-man, spider man," Romeo muttered under his<br/>breath. "He can do whatever a spider can..."<p>He inched along the ceiling until he reached the<br/>camera and then clinged to the camera for long enough<br/>to find the button to shut it off. That succeeded he<br/>dropped to the floor and shifted into hybrid and<br/>hurried to the bed to check on his rescuee.<p>She was beaten severely, and with silver. He could<br/>smell the burns even before he saw them all across her<br/>back through the torn dress. There couldn't be a<br/>reason for this, she was just a bystander for goodness<br/>sakes. She was younger than he was.<p>Feeling faint about what he had just decided, Romeo<br/>took his tools out of his night suit and went to the<br/>door. It took a minute or two, but he worked his way<br/>into the opening panel and wired it open eventually.<br/>That left him only a couple more minutes before they<br/>discovered he was AWOL. It was time to skedadle.<p>He returned to the bed and gingerly picked up the girl<br/>he had dragged here, and left the room, closing the<br/>door behind them.<p>He had to dodge patrols a few times, but more or less<br/>he got out of there very easily. Easily enough that<br/>it made him worried. Any easy accomplisment in Zero's<br/>training was soon followed by something incredibly<br/>bad, and so he worried. He was well away from the<br/>headquarters when Nabiki started to wake up.<p>"Get out of my head," she muttered weakly once before<br/>falling back asleep.<p>"Oh man," Romeo said. "Her family is going to kill<br/>me."<p>********<p>"The package is being delivered," his aide said.<br/>Gothwrain smiled darkly as he considered the veritable<br/>time bomb Romeo was taking with him.
