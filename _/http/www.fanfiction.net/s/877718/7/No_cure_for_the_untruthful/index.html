</div><p>.com/usako94344/</p><p>Hi-minna!  Back  once again with chapter 7!  I would like  to thank you all for reviewing my story! (Especially my regulars and you know  who you are).  I love to read all your  reviews… they inspire me so much.  Well,  read and enjoy! ^_^</p><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma ½ :(</p><p>Akane slowly backed away from the spot  where Ranma and Ryoga were sitting, after she heard Ranma mention that they  should find Akane and try to explain themselves.</p><p>Akane tried to quickly but quietly dart  back to the area in which she had previously been.</p><p>"I wonder where Akane went."  Ranma thought aloud as Ryoga and himself  were making their way around the area.   They suddenly came to a halt at the sound of Akane's voice.  She was talking to herself about  something.  Then she seemed to ponder  heavily over something.</p><p>"Akane!"  Ranma yelled interrupting her thoughts as he made his way toward  Akane.  Ranma ran up to Akane, ready to  apologize and give an explanation. "Akane, we just wanted to-" Akane cut Ranma  off with a shake of her head.</p><p>"It's okay, Ranma.  I thought about it some and it really was my  fault that I never noticed to clues you always threw at me about P-chan."  Akane said laughing cheerfully.</p><p>Ranma and Ryoga reared back; suddenly  afraid of Akane and the way she was acting.</p><p>"So your not mad anymore?"  Ryoga asked cautiously.</p><p>Akane laughed merrily, (which sounded  slightly satanic to Ranma's ears) "Of course not.  I just told you I'm not mad at you guys."  Akane said smiling.</p><p>The confused duo looked at each other  then back at Akane.  Something just  wasn't right.  The Akane they knew  wouldn't be acting this nice to them after what they had just done.</p><p>Deciding not to explore this oddity too  much, lest Akane turned back into herself and decide to kill them, he told her  that they should return home.  He then  turned to Ryoga.  "Ryoga, are you coming  with us?"  Ranma inquired.</p><p>"No.   Even though Akane-san says she forgives me, I am still too ashamed to be  here.  Farewell, you will not see me  again."  Ryoga said as he dashed off to  God knows where before Ranma could stop him.   'Oh well.  He'll probably get  lost and end up back in Nerima anyway.'   Ranma turned to Akane shrugging his shoulders.  "Are you ready to go?"  He  asked again.</p><p>"Yeah, we should.  I want to see my family and…Hiroshi."  She finished almost dreamily, turning as she  said his name so that she could be sure that Ranma had heard her.</p><p>This comment quickly erased the smile  that Ranma wore.  His eyes narrowed  dangerously.  "What do you mean by  that?"  Ranma hissed.</p><p>"Me?   Oh nothing."  Akane replied  nonchalantly, seeming to come out of her dreamy state.  Then turning to Ranma "We should start off  now."  She replied, as she went to go  gather her belongings.</p><p>"I just can't wait to get back  home."  Akane said looking back at Ranma  as she started back on the trial to get home.</p><p>'Yeah I bet' Ranma silently fumed as he  trailed Akane.</p><p>'So far so good.'  Akane thought to herself as she looked back  at the fuming pigtailed boy.  'At least  I know that he at least cares about me.'   Akane looked back once more at him.   She saw the anger and the underlying hurt in his eyes.  It almost made her not want to go through  with the rest of her plan.  Almost.</p><p>The two had finally made it home, and  Soun and Genma were sitting on the porch playing Shogi.  Genma saw Ranma and Akane first.</p><p>"Ranma, Akane!  Where have you to been?"  Genma asked slowly getting up.</p><p>At his friends comment Soun finally  looked up.  "Akane, Ranma where were  you?"  Soun asked, taking one of Genma's  Shogi pieces off the board before getting up also.</p><p>Akane walked up the porch to greet her  father and Genma, Ranma slowly trailing behind her.  Akane smiled sheepishly at Genma and her father.  "I guess you can say we were taking a  "vacation."</p><p>"Oh, a vacation." Genma and Soun  replied at the same time looked at each other and start discussing something  among themselves.  Something about hasty  marriages and such.</p><p>Both Akane and Ranma suddenly realized  what their parents were thinking.  "It  wasn't like that!"  They both yelled,  turning red with embarrassment.</p><p>"Akane-san.  Your back!"  Hiroshi  yelled, suddenly coming out of the training hall.</p><p>'Here goes nothing.'  "Hiroshi!"   Akane yelled back, running past a stunned Ranma and into Hiroshi's  arms.  "I missed you."  She sighed adoringly.</p><p>Ranma was not the only one surprised at  Akane's reaction.  Hiroshi just stood  there looking at the girl in his arms.   Then a slow grin crept across his face.   'So Akane has finally come to her senses.'  He thought, as he returned her embrace.  "I missed you too, Akane."   Intentionally taking the honorific off of her name.</p><p>This did not go unnoticed by  Ranma.  'Who the hell did he think he  was, putting his dirty hands on MY Akane?'   Ranma fumed.  "If you ever want  to be able to use your hands again, I suggest that you take them off my  girl."  Ranma growled.</p><p>Hiroshi abruptly let go of Akane, his  eyes narrowing slightly.  "Is that a  challenge?"  Hiroshi demanded, dropping  into a fighting stance.</p><p>"Yeah."  Ranma said, also getting ready to fight.</p><p>Akane who had been slightly stunned at  Ranma's reaction sought to break up their   would be fight.  She wanted Ranma  jealous, but she didn't want one of them seriously hurt.  And by the way they were eyeing each other,  one of them would be.</p><p>"Ranma, by the way you are acting, you  would think that you care about me!"   Akane said trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.</p><p>Ranma scoffed wanting to say something  that would fix his wounded pride.  "Are  you kidding? Why would I not care about someone like you?"  Ranma looked slightly surprised.  'I almost forgot about the truth potion.'</p><p>Akane hid her surprise as best she  could.  Had she heard him right?  She was about to ask him what he had just  said but was interrupted by her sister.</p><p>Kasumi appeared on the porch.  "Father, Genma-kun lunch is re-" She stopped  when she saw Akane.  "Akane, Ranma!  Your back!"   She smiled.  "Lunch is  ready.  You can come in and tell me all  about it."  Kasumi said, going back into  the dojo.</p><p>Hiroshi went into the dojo after  Kasumi.  When Akane was about to enter  the dojo, she felt something tug on her arm.   She turned around to see Ranma.   The vulnerable expression he wore tugged at her heartstrings, making her  feel really low.  "What do you want  Ranma?"  Akane asked with a sigh.</p><p>"How could you like him even after he  lied to you?"  Ranma winced after he  realized his error.</p><p>Akane turned around fully to look at  him.  "Like you did?"  She asked, watching Ranma cringe.  "I don't want to play your games anymore."  She said, as she made her way into the dojo.</p><p>Ranma stood rooted to the spot;  completely baffled by the way Akane was acting.  He was currently unaware of the going on's around him.  Or the dark clouds starting to appear, as it  started to sprinkle.</p><p>Lunch had long been over and it had  started to rain.  Akane was starting to  get worried because Ranma was still outside.   Kasumi informed them that it was now almost time for dinner. Akane was  about to use this opportunity to go outside and check on Ranma.</p><p>"Akane-san, where are you going?"  Asked Hiroshi</p><p>"I'm just going to go tell Ranma that  dinner is ready."  Akane said  nonchalantly.</p><p>"It's raining outside.  I'll do it."  Hiroshi said getting up and going out of the dojo.  "Ranma-kun-" Hiroshi stopped when he saw the  red haired girl, who was giving him an icy glare.  Hiroshi's eyes roamed over her appreciatively.</p><p>"What the hell are you staring at you  bastard!"  Girl-type Ranma  demanded.  Then coming closer.  "And if you think that you can take my woman  away from me, you have another thing coming!"   She finished storming off.</p><p>Hiroshi stood there stunned, not  entirely sure of what had just happened.</p><p>Ranma slowly opened his eyes and  surveyed his surroundings.  'I must have  fallen asleep in the training hall after I was here training.'  He thought, groggily rubbing his eyes.  He left the training hall and went looking  for Akane.  Nabiki appeared on the  porch.</p><p>"If you're looking for Akane, she went  to the movies with Hiroshi."  Nabiki  said.</p><p>Ranma immediately turned angry "Which  one did they go to?"  He asked angrily.</p><p>"Money talks you know."  She said holding out her hand.</p><p>Not willing to haggle over a price, Ranma  slapped some money into her hand.   "Where did they go?"  Ranma asked  again.</p><p>As Ranma came up to the theater, he saw  Akane and Hiroshi buying tickets.  He  was following behind them in a trench coat, so that hopefully, he wouldn't be  noticed.  He was about to enter the  theater with them, when the ticket person told him he had to buy a ticket.  He had given all his money to Nabiki.  He had only one option.</p><p>He went to go find some cold  water.  Moments latter, a cute red head  appeared.  She walked up to a boy about  to buy tickets.</p><p>Girl-type Ranma threw on her best smile  and fluttered her eyelashes.  "Will you  buy me some tickets, please?"  She asked  the boy.</p><p>Seeing this, the boy couldn't  resist.  As soon as she had the ticket,  she raced off after Akane and Hiroshi, leaving the dumbfounded boy.</p><p>Ranma spotted them and sat 3 rows  behind them.  Hiroshi was trying to put  his arm around Akane.  Ranma grabbed the  nearest thing to him, which happened to be some Jr. mints that belonged to the  person right next to him.  Despite the  protest of the owner of the Jr. mints, he threw a little brown ball at  Hiroshi's head.</p><p>Hiroshi immediately looked back to see what  had hit him in the head.  Akane wanting  to see what was wrong looked back and immediately spotted Ranma.  A relieved smile graced her face.  "Hiroshi, I have to go use the  bathroom."  Akane said getting up to  leave, Ranma following close behind her.</p><p>Akane waited outside the theater  waiting for Ranma.  She was relieved  that Ranma had followed them.  'What's  taking him so long?'  Akane thought as  several minutes had already past.  Then  she saw Ranma come out of the theater.   Only this time he was a boy again.</p><p>He looked very angry.  "How could you Akane? We never even went to  the movies together, but you go with that lying loser?"  He asked loudly, people starting to listen  to them.</p><p>"Ranma, do you even like me?"  Akane asked trying not to sound to hopeful.</p><p>Ranma looked her in the eyes.  "No."  H e replied sincerely.</p><p>This reply hurt Akane severely, her  eyes starting to tear up.</p><p>"I love you."  Ranma whispered, taking Akane's hands.</p><p>*Dodges objects* I know I'm sorry about  the cliffhangers!  I promise you  this is the last one though.  I only have  one more chapter to go. *Sob* I'm sad already.   Also, I hope I didn't disappoint anyone because of Akane's "Big  Plan".  It's like this; I usually plan  out everything I do.  But for this fic,  I didn't plan out anything that I put into this fic.  As a matter of fact, I dreamt the whole plot.  I just got on the computer and starting  writing.  So when I put that chapter up  last week, I was like 'yeah her plan will be good.'  Then I thought about it, and realized that I didn't even know  what her plan was.  So this was kind of  like a last resort.  Anyways, please  review and tell me how you liked it.   And for all you WAFF people, I promise next chapter will be a total  WAFF.</p>
