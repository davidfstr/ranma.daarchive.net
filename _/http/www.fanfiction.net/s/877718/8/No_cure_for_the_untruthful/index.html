</div><p>.com/usako94344/</p><p>Hi-minna!   This is the last chapter  *sob*  seem to have come so fast.  I hope you  guys enjoyed reading this fic as much as I enjoyed writing it.  You guys have all been so great to me.  Even the criticism for this fic was great  also.   Well enough talk, on with  chapter 8.  Enjoy! ^_^</p><p>JSYK: WAFF means warm and fuzzy feelings.</p><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma ½ :(</p><p>Ranma stared intently into the stupefied eyes of  his love.  The look on her face made him  chuckle lightly.</p><p>Hearing this, Akane turned her eyes on the  pigtailed boy he currently held her hands in his.  Even though she knew that he was unable to lie for the time  being, she decided to confirm what she had just heard.</p><p>"Ranma, is this true? You better not be playing  with me or I'll-" Ranma gently put his finger to Akane's lips; momentarily  halting her speech.</p><p>"No…I'm telling the truth."  Ranma replied honestly.  "Akane, We-" A soft sigh coming from the  side of him stopped him.  He then  noticed the awe struck crowed that had slowly gathered around them during his  passionate declaration.</p><p>The two started blushing furiously because of the  crowd they had attracted.</p><p>"Akane, we need to talk.  Lets go somewhere more private."   He suggested quietly, taking her hands and leading them away for the  crowd.</p><p>Akane dug her heel in the ground to halt the  determined boy.  "Wait… what about  Hiroshi? I…" She trailed off seeing Ranma's eyes harden at the mention of  Hiroshi's name.</p><p>"He's not a baby.   He can find his way back to the dojo.   Or where he came from."  Ranma  growled.  Turning back to Akane "Come  on."  He said tugging on her arm leading  her to the destination that he had in mind.</p><p>Pulling Akane into a deserted Alleyway (I didn't  know where else to put them), Ranma decided to tell Akane everything.</p><p>"Akane, the first night Hiroshi came, I both of you  made me really jealous.  I hated you for  making me feel that way, and myself for feeling that way.  So, I went for a walk and ended up at the  Neko Hanten.  Shampoo gave me something  to eat.  I think she put some kind of-"  Ranma didn't get to finish.</p><p>"Truth potion?"   Akane inquired.</p><p>"Yeah, so anyways- how did you know that!"  Ranma yelled, surprised that Akane knew  about his predicament.</p><p>"I found out about it after I found out that Ryoga  was actually P-chan."  Akane said,  feeling really callous for the way she went about handling things with Ranma.</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane suspiciously.  "Was this whole Hiroshi thing all just a big  prank?"  Ranma asked a little hopeful.</p><p>Akane looked down, not wanting to make eye contact  with Ranma.  "Yeah.  After I found out about the truth potion, I  was so angry that you didn't tell me about it that I really wanted to hurt  you.  I tried to hurt you by using  Hiroshi."  Akane murmured, looking at  Ranma and then at her hands.  Ranma eyes  hardened slightly after hearing this.   He slowly turned around to face to wall, silently assessing their  current situation.</p><p>There was a long bout of silence after Akane's  confession.  Not able to take it anymore,  Akane desperately tried to get him to see why she had done it.  "Ranma I don't know what I was thinking, and  I'm sorry! I-" Ranma suddenly jerked around to face her.  His eyes suddenly became soft again after  taking in Akane's regretful expression.</p><p>He sighed touching her face lightly with the palm  of his hand.  He then gently tilted her  face up, so that she met his gaze.</p><p>"It's okay now Akane.  I understand.  I probably  deserved it anyway, not telling you about P-chan and all."  Ranma said softly.</p><p>"Anyways, you didn't let me finish."  He scolded softly.  "So after I found out the truth potion would last, I decided I  had to get away."  Ranma finished.</p><p>"But why did you have to run away?"  Akane asked confused.</p><p>Ranma smirked, leaning against the opposite wall.  "I wanted to get away from you.  I  didn't want to let you know how I really felt.   I thought I would just end up hurt in the end."  Ranma finished, his eyes turned toward the  sky, unwilling to make eye contact with Akane.</p><p>"And how do you feel about me?"  Akane asked, wanting to hear him say he  loved her again.</p><p>"I just told you…I love you.  I think I always have."  Ranma said getting off the wall to be closer  to Akane.  He put his hand back on her  soft cheek.</p><p>Akane looked into Ranma's eyes, seeing a myriad of  emotions darken them beautifully.  "What  are you thinking right now?"  Akane  asked, as her heart started to beat fast.</p><p>"I'm thinking I want to kiss you."  Ranma said huskily as he brought her lips up  to meet his.  Rapping his arms around  Akane, he slowly deepened the kiss.   Akane moaned lightly when Ranma ran his tongue on the outside of her  bottom lip, begging entrance to her mouth to which Akane readily complied.</p><p>He then slowly pulled away to look into Akane's  glazed eyes.  Seeing her expression of  awe and contentment made Ranma extremely happy.</p><p>Smiling warmly "Lets go home, you uncute  tomboy."  Ranma said jokingly, rubbing  the top of Akane's head affectionately.</p><p>"Hey, I'm not a dog!"  Akane said, pushing Ranma's hand off of her head, equally  playful.</p><p>Ranma suddenly stopped when he realized that he  could lie again.</p><p>Akane turned to Ranma worriedly.  "Ranma, what's wrong."  Akane inquired.</p><p>"Oh nothing.   I think the truth potion wore off though."  Ranma said.</p><p>"Oh."  Akane  said, doubt slowly starting to graze her pretty face.</p><p>Ranma noticed this immediately.  "I didn't lie about the way I feel about  you, if that's what your thinking."   Ranma said exasperated.</p><p>"I'm sorry.   I guess I was just getting insecure."   Akane said smiling sheepishly.   Then grabbing Ranma's hand.   "Lets go home."</p><p>The two made their way back to the dojo hand in  hand.  Soun and Genma who turned from  their game of Shogi immediately greeted them.</p><p>"Ranma, Akane! Your back…" Soun trailed off when he  noticed that they were holding hands.   Genma to had apparently noticed also.   They gave each other knowing looks as they suddenly started crying tears  of joy.</p><p>"Genma-kun.   It has finally happened.  They  are getting along now!"  Wailed Akane's  joyful father; embarrassing his daughter with his crying.</p><p>Ranma and Akane exchanged looks and headed for the  training hall.</p><p>"Did you see the look on my dads face when he saw  us holding hands?"  Akane laughed as she  slid down the wall to sit next to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma turned his amused gaze on her.  "Yeah they couldn't believe it.  I almost can't either."  Ranma said leaning down to kiss her.</p><p>"Remove your hands from Akane-san."  Hiroshi said with deadly calm, his eyes hard  as black marbles, as he made his way toward the confused two.</p><p>After the two got over their initial shock, Ranma  jumped up.  "What do you mean?  She's not your girlfriend."  Ranma growled, slowly getting, suddenly in  the mood for a fight.</p><p>Akane immediately got up to prevent a fight that  she had caused.  She placed herself  between Ranma and Hiroshi.  "Hiroshi I  have a lot of explaining to do."  Akane  said guiltily.</p><p>After assessing Ranma for a while, he turned his  gaze to Akane.  His eyes softened  immediately upon looking at Akane.   "What is it, Akane-san?"  Hiroshi  asked curiously.</p><p>Akane turned her gaze to her hands, making them  seem very interesting at the moment.   "Well, yesterday when I acted like I really liked you, it was all a plan  just to make Ranma jealous.  You see I  love Ranma, but he hurt me so I wanted to get back at him.  But to get back at him, I used you.  Can you ever forgive me for putting you  through this Hiroshi?"  Akane pleaded,  finally looking Hiroshi in the eyes.  "Please?"</p><p>Hiroshi just stared at Akane for a while, his dark  enigmatic eyes turning hard at Akane's betrayal.  After making her wait some more, he finally said something.  "Even thought I can't believe you did that,  I care about you enough to want to see you happy.  And if being with Ranma-kun makes you happy, then it makes me  happy also."  He replied tightly.</p><p>"Thank you so much Hiroshi-san.  That means a lot to me."  Akane whispered sincerely.</p><p>Ranma cleared his throat to remind the two that he  was still there.</p><p>"Well it's time I get going anyways."  Hiroshi said looking away.  Then he turned to Ranma.  "I wish you and Akane the best." He said as  he exited the training hall and out of the dojo.</p><p>Akane turned to Ranma.  "Ranma I feel so bad about this whole situation.  I-" Akane stopped as Ranma cut her off.</p><p>"It's okay.   You didn't do anything that bad.   I mean sure you played with my head and my emotions and made a guy think  that you liked him when you didn't.   That's not that bad at all."   Ranma finished nonchalantly.</p><p>Akane bowed her head in shame until she heard Ranma  burst out laughing.  She hit him when  she realized he had been making fun of her, making laugh even harder.</p><p>He suddenly pulled her into a warm embrace, placing  his chin on the top of her head.</p><p>Akane broke the silence.  "Ranma, there something I have been meaning to ask you."  Akane said pulling slightly away from  Ranma.  "Do you really like being a  girl?"  She asked innocently.  She laughed when saw the comical expression  that Ranma wore.  Her laugh proved  contagious as Ranma started laughing at the situation that they were in.</p><p>"I love you Ranma."  She murmured against his chest.</p><p>"I love you to, my unsexy tomboy."  Ranma joked as they held each other both  looking forward to a happy future together.</p><p>Owari</p><p>I'm done *sob* I loved writing this  story so much I didn't want it to end.   I know they were probably way out of character, but it couldn't be  helped.  It was probably too mushy  to.  Anyways, I have another fic coming  out sometime next week.  I might make it  a sequel to this one or just make it another fic.  I haven't decided yet.   Also, I need a beta-reader.   Anyone interested in helping me, please send e-mail to .</p><p>Thanks to:</p><p>Ed Masters, Flameraven, Chris, ceres84,  shiannime, Lady DeathAngel, Kalio Halos, Stephanie, Miss OCD, Lagjr, Mav  Phoenix, Ghost in the Machine, Wlah, Mel, KATO, Lipana, Minako-chan, Dane17,  Snowball Dragon, VGJ, Calophi, AngelicFairy, Goddess of details, Hannah Conway,  fireblaze, lis-chan, astroboy23222, Chibi Akane-chan2, Platnium-Djinn, Sonic, Urazz_Izmyne, Taxzombie, Hitomi, Abby Kitty, Tatsu no Houou,  Thunder, Olympus83, Libhranan, Milana Pashmina, CLAMP Kid, Kierkan Stormfist,  Cherokey, Swede01, DemonBlade, James W.
