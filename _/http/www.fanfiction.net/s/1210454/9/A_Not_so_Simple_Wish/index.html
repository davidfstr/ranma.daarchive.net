</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 17<p>Happosai tutted to himself as he tried to straighten out another set of panties. After he left<br/>on his little trip to Okinawa (those cheerleaders had been surprisingly shy, but he was<br/>sure they secretly enjoyed his method of showing appreciation) he had returned to find<br/>Ranko had stuffed his entire collection in the cupboard under the sink. He was actually<br/>surprised she had managed to compress it that much, but it left him with the arduous task<br/>of restoring the silky darlings to a more presentable state. A thankless, but still personally<br/>rewarding task for the aged grandmaster of Anything Goes, even if he'd rather be getting<br/>to know the new aquisitions, it was always worth taking the time to remember previous<br/>conquests.<p>Suddenly the front door of the apartment exploded inwards, and a raging redhead<br/>entered, giving Happosai a particularly murderous glare. "Old letch." she growled<br/>challengingly at him.<p>"What is it, Ranko-chan?" Happosai asked, wondering what had her panties in a bunch...<br/>actually he was just wondering what colour her panties were, but he was still thinking of<br/>her... kinda...<p>Ranko stormed over to loom over Happosai, not bothering to take her shoes off as she<br/>entered the apartment proper, and spoke in an almost conversational tone. "I just got<br/>back into town today, and I heard the craziest thing."<p>"Um... what would that be, Ranko-chan?" Happosai asked tremulously, no longer<br/>wondering what colour her panties were.<p>They were white. He could see as much thanks to her short skirt and his own diminuitive<br/>stature, coupled with their relative positions. Why didn't she even own anything lacy or<br/>frilly? Always the exact same boring plain underwear...<p>"That you attacked Ranma and said you were doing it on my behalf? Please tell me I'm<br/>mistaken so I don't have to kick your ass." Ranko glared down at Happosai and tapped<br/>her foot impatiently.<p>Happosai blinked, why was she upset over that? It was only right that Ranma had to<br/>prove himself. To tell the truth he was rather impressed with the boy's spirit, and while<br/>his skills weren't up to Ranko's level, he showed a lot of potential. "Of course I did,<br/>Ranko-chan. Can't have you marrying a weakling now. The boy wasn't bad actually, at<br/>least nothing some hard training can't fix."<p>"Oh." Ranko seemed rather nonplussed by that response, but at least she was calm... at<br/>least until she picked Happosai up and started screaming in his face. "And don't you<br/>think maybe he might not want to marry some psycho bitch who gets her aged master to<br/>beat up on him? Huh?"<p>Happosai distastefully wiped away some of the spittle on his face as he waited for his<br/>hearing to return. That girl sure had a healthy set of lungs. "Don't be so naive, Ranko-<br/>chan. By making things more challenging for him, you'll seem unobtainable and he'll<br/>strive even harder to get you! Why, I recall a pair of panties belonging to a lovely young<br/>girl I knew back in the thirties, she did all sorts of stuff to keep me away, and it was<br/>probably one of my greatest challenges, but once I finally got them I was happy as can<br/>be! Of course, I never saw her again after I stole her panties, since the thrill is in the<br/>chase, but that's my point... at least I think it is..." Happosai trailed off his rambling,<br/>becoming lost in pleasant memories and not really sure what he had been trying to<br/>convince her of.<p>His happy reverie was interrupted when Ranko dropped him and angrily yelled "I am not<br/>a pair of panties!"<p>"It was just an analogy." Happosai offered in a small voice.<p>"Well it wasn't a very good one! I let you live under my roof, I feed you, I put up with<br/>your perversion, and this is how you repay me? By making me look bad to Ranma? If<br/>he doesn't fall in love with me it'll ruin everything!" Ranko looked to be in serious danger<br/>of bursting a blood vessel given the way veins were clearly visible popping out on her<br/>forehead.<p>Happosai eyed his student curiously, finding something somewhat... odd... in the way she<br/>worded that, but unsure just what to make of it. "I'm sure if things don't work out with<br/>him then you can find someone better - plenty more fish in the sea as they say."<p>Ranko's expression became deathly calm as she said "There is no one else." in a flat<br/>voice. "If I can't get Ranma then I might as well be dead."<p>Happosai didn't really have much experience in normal human relationships, but he was<br/>pretty sure that was a rather unhealthy view to take. "Well, if you can't find love you can<br/>always dedicate yourself to a worthy cause - like liberating the silky darlings!" he said,<br/>somehow thinking that prospect would appeal to her.<p>Ranko tiredly slumped to the floor, her anger now spent and looking like she might cry.<br/>"Just get out." she said quietly.<p>"Ranko-chan?" Happosai said, hesitantly reaching out to her.<p>Her head snapped up and she pierced him with a look that would have killed perhaps<br/>anyone but a cockroach like him. "I don't need you screwing things up. Get out and don't<br/>come back."<p>Happosai swallowed his next words, somehow feeling cowed by the intensity of anger<br/>directed at him, and silently left the apartment, not even bothering to gather up his<br/>collection.<p>***<p>Ryouga Hibiki was deep in thought as he sat in his tent that night. Surprisingly, he was<br/>not thinking of his upcoming battle with Ranma and the chance to finally avenge himself<br/>for the insult of the bread. Instead he was thinking of a person he had only met that day.<p>"Ranko-san..."<p>He recalled all the times she insulted his sense of direction during the time they had been<br/>together, yet he didn't get angry. Perhaps because unlike when his classmates had<br/>insulted him in that mean spirited, snide way they did, Ranko-san's insults had carried an<br/>almost affectionate warmth, as if she didn't really care about the things she appeared to<br/>get angry about.<p>He considered that. He himself was pretty poor at dealing with people, and tended to get<br/>angry a lot even if it wasn't really warranted. Perhaps Ranko-san was similar? In spite of<br/>her sometimes harsh words, she had tried hard to help him get to Furinkan - the lost boy<br/>blushed as he recalled the few times she had taken his hand to steer him in the right<br/>direction - those insults had to be just a barrier she put up to hide the sweet, caring girl<br/>underneath?<p>Thinking of those petite yet calloused hands, he considered just how strong she had to be,<br/>not only had she stopped his umbrella, but she had actually warped the metal head!<br/>Ryouga often had trouble with his monstrous strength making people afraid of him<br/>(although oddly enough, Ryouga violently hated the first person he had met who hadn't<br/>cared about that - Ranma), though it didn't stop them insulting him, it just made them do<br/>so when they thought he wasn't listening.<p>Did people hate and fear Ranko-san because she was so strong? Maybe that was why she<br/>felt the need to close herself off behind a wall of cold words? He couldn't imagine how<br/>anyone could do that to such a sweet (not to mention pretty) girl. Ranko-san was like a<br/>Goddess!<p>That thought only caused shameful tears to spill down Ryouga's cheeks, for he would<br/>never be worthy of her. Who could love a freak like him? It was bad enough with just his<br/>wretched sense of direction, but the curse he had gotten in China...<p>It wasn't fair! How was he to know demons were real, and to have the bad luck of<br/>running into one? He was just walking along when he came across an abandoned<br/>backpack. Deciding to do a good deed, he picked it up to drop off in the next police<br/>station he came across (of course, with Ryouga that could be thousands of miles from<br/>where he found the thing) when an enormous winged bull monster demon thing had<br/>come walking out of the woods and spotted him. The demon tried to take the backpack -<br/>no doubt for some evil hellish purpose - and when Ryouga had tried to fight it off, he had<br/>been brutally pummeled into unconsciousness by the monster.<p>When he woke up, he was being carried through the air by the demon, which then<br/>dropped him into a cold spring in a valley filled with the same. In his nightmares he still<br/>heard the mooing laughter of the hideous hellbeast as it sealed his fate. Thus Ryouga<br/>Hibiki had been forever cursed to live in fear of cold water for the rest of his days.<p>Who could love a pig?<p>***<p>Like yesterday, a fair sized crowd of Furinkan students were present for the upcoming<br/>fight between Ranma and Ryouga. Ranko had picked out a decent spot and was standing<br/>by herself while Ranma was in the middle of the field waiting for Ryouga to finish<br/>dismantling his tent.<p>"Ranko."<p>"Huh?" Ranko turned at hearing her name, and almost recoiled in shock at the sight<br/>which greeted her.<p>Nabiki Tendou could easily be described as a rather attractive specimen of the female<br/>gender, in fact, an unbiased observer would be hard pressed to find something bad to say<br/>about her physical assets. Under normal circumstances that is. Right now she looked<br/>anything but attractive; her eyes were bloodshot, with dark bags underneath them, while<br/>her skin held an unhealthy pallour and her hair looked lank and mussed.<p>"Make. Up. With. Happosai." Nabiki enunciated each word clearly, despite sounding<br/>like she would drop dead (or at least into a nice relaxing coma) at any moment.<p>"Huh?" Ranko repeated herself, a gormless expression of confusion settling over her<br/>features.<p>"He stole all the underwear, he keeps poking holes in the shoji, he attached himself to my<br/>chest no less than fifteen times, and he kept us up all night with his crying and wailing<br/>about how you hate him." Nabiki said. "Now normally I would be thrilled that the little<br/>freak is miserable, but not if he insists on spreading the misery! Take him back!"<p>So the old letch finally moved in with the Tendous? Ranko thought to herself, but her<br/>actual words were "So if he stole all the underwear, what are you wearing now?" She<br/>asked curiously.<p>Not being at her mental peak, Nabiki answered before her brain truly parsed the<br/>question. "I'm wearing my gym shorts and sports bra that I had at school."<p>"Really?" Ranko chewed her bottom lip thoughtfully as she scanned the crowd to locate<br/>the other Tendou sisters. "What about Akane and Kasumi?"<p>"He didn't take Kasumi's stuff for some reason, I don't know what Akane is doing."<br/>Nabiki responded automatically before her brain finally caught up with the conversation.<br/>"Hey! What the hell kind of question is that?"<p>Ranko just grinned in response as she hurried over to join Akane and Kasumi. "Hi<br/>girls!" She said brightly when she got close enough to the pair.<p>"Er... hello Ranko-chan." Kasumi said hesitantly, not really sure how she was supposed<br/>to relate to her nominal rival.<p>Akane just mumbled "G'way, 'm too tired to fight you today..."<p>"You're the one who starts all our fights, Akane-chan." Ranko admonished, waggling a<br/>reproving finger at the tomboy, who responded by throwing a truly pathetic punch which<br/>fell short of actually hitting the intended target.<p>Ranko just sighed, not being able to find it in herself to bother making fun of Akane<br/>when she was like this, since Akane's normally violent responses were half the fun. "Hey,<br/>the fight's starting." She observed, noting that Ryouga was now lunging at Ranma with a<br/>complicated looking series of umbrella attacks, all of which were dodged with ease.<p>"Because of you I have seen hell!" Ryouga screamed at his rival, while Ranko mouthed<br/>the words along with him, a silly grin on her face.<p>The fight continued with Ryouga throwing his umbrella in a wide arc (which didn't seem<br/>to accomplish anything at all) before tieing his arm to Ranma's with a bandanna and<br/>trading more blows with the pigtailed boy. None of his attacks landed, while Ranma<br/>wasn't really putting any serious effort into attacking, but one of the students nearby still<br/>said "Wow, that guy might be an even match for Saotome!" which prompted a dismissive<br/>snort from Ranko.<p>"Yow! What's with this umbrella? This thing weighs a ton!"<p>Ranko turned to see Hiroshi and Daisuke struggling with Ryouga's umbrella, and<br/>strolled over to casually pick the thing up with one hand and twirl it around before<br/>jauntily perching it on her shoulder and grinning at the pair. "Yeah, he must have the<br/>strength of a monster." she remarked sarcasticly.<p>Returning her attention to the fight, Ranko saw the boys were now battling in mid air,<br/>and upon landing Ranma hit Ryouga with a flip kick which tore the bandanna between<br/>them and sent Ryouga flying to land hard near her position. At this, Ranko could only<br/>smile goofily and think; Wow, do I look that cool when I fight? I am such a badass!<p>Dropping the umbrella, Ranko took a few steps backwards, to watch as Ryouga dived to<br/>recover it after taking a few good hits from Ranma and counterattacked, ripping Ranma's<br/>shirt in the process.<p>"Dammit! Every time I fight, my clothes get ruined! This was my favourite shirt too!"<br/>The pigtailed boy lamented as he examined the large tear over the front of his shirt,<br/>luckily his skin was undamaged.<p>"This is war!" Ryouga growled, rubbing at his chin which was starting to look a little<br/>bruised. "Don't act like a girl!"<p>"Feh!" Ranma snorted dismissively. "After listenin' ta you bitch and moan about the<br/>bread I think I'm not the one who acts like a girl."<p>Unseen, Ranko blushed as she wished she had thought of a good comeback like that, but<br/>due to her curse, she had been a little more sensitive to insults about femininity...<p>Ryouga purpled with rage and yelled "You still think this is about bread?"<p>Ranma shrugged, but still maintained his ready stance. "Well, yeah. I mean all that 'I<br/>have seen hell!' stuff is pretty vague, so I dunno what you're so pissed off about."<p>Ryouga clenched his fists angrily, and Ranko felt that if he had learned the Shi Shi<br/>Hokoudan, he'd be setting himself up for the mother of all perfect attacks, but since he<br/>didn't know that move, he just attacked with his fists. "As if mere words can convey the<br/>depths of my suffering!" he roared.<p>Ranma just dodged his unthinking and angry assault with contemptuous ease. "I dunno,<br/>maybe if you spent more time thinking instead of chargin' around yelling about hell, you<br/>could." He replied before weaving inside Ryouga's guard and launching a vicious<br/>counterattack which swiftly overwhelmed the lost boy.<p>"Damn you!" Ryouga cried bitterly as his legs gave out and he collapsed at Ranma's feet.<p>Ranma just looked down at him with a speculative expression and said. "You've<br/>improved a lot since we went to school together. I don't mind fighting, but stop blaming<br/>me for all your problems," had Ranma stopped speaking there, he might have made an<br/>impression on Ryouga which could have led to them becoming friends, but alas he had to<br/>add "ya big stupid moron." to the end of his statement.<p>With some difficulty, Ryouga pushed himself up to his knees and glared at Ranma's back<br/>where he was walking away. "How dare you walk away from me!" The lost boy yelled<br/>before flinging a mass of inexplicably sharp whirling bandannas at his hated foe before<br/>collapsing once more.<p>Ranma easily dodged the projectiles, but then looked in horror to see they were headed<br/>towards a crowd of students, which included his two fiancees. "Look out!" He cried<br/>desperately.<p>Ranko just sighed and moved in front of everybody else to swiftly snatch the bandannas<br/>out of the air, grabbing them at just the right point to prevent them from slicing up her<br/>hands.<p>Ranma gaped at his fiancee in shock. "I barely saw you move! How did you do that?"<p>Ranko giggled nervously, not exactly wanting to be seen as a threat or competitor for her<br/>skills, which she knew would make things between her and Ranma much more difficult.<br/>"Lots of practice?" She offered hesitantly.<p>"You have to teach me that!" Ranma asked, a pleading expression on his face. "If I could<br/>move that fast, the old freak is toast!"<p>Ranko groaned. Refusing would alienate herself from him, but accepting carried it's own<br/>risks. Dammit! I don't wanna be like the old ghoul! she protested mentally, even as she<br/>spoke. "I guess I could give you a few pointers." She said, a sickly smile on her face.<p>***
