</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris<p>Prologue<p>Ranma giddily held the ancient Chinese artifact aloft, it was all he could do not to release an<br/>out of character (but very cathartic) maniacal laugh. "I, Ranma Saotome, wish to be free of<br/>the curse of Nyannichuan!" He yelled triumphantly, cheerfully thinking of finally being<br/>normal again.<p>"Silly customer, Mystic Urn of Xiawang no grant wishes until you pay for it." Said the<br/>elderly proprieter of 'Honest Wong's Magical Chinese Shoppe'.<p>"Oh... right..." Ranma blushed as he put the urn back on the counter and started rifling<br/>through his pockets "Sorry about that, just got carried away for a moment there." He<br/>chuckled good naturedly before handing over ten thousand yen.<p>"And your change." Wong smiled genially as he handed a five yen coin to Ranma.<p>Ranma was about to lift up the urn and make his wish when he suddenly realised what was<br/>about to happen. Obviously now that he had the solution to his greatest problems, Ryouga<br/>would burst in and attack him for forgetting to leave the toilet seat down for Akane or<br/>something. Carefully placing the urn on the ground next to the counter where it would<br/>hopefully appear inconspicous, he made a show of looking around before theatrically<br/>announcing "Boy, I sure hope-"<p>He was cut off as the wall exploded inwards "Ranma!" An enraged sometimes pig bellowed<br/>"How dare you inconvienience Akane-san like that! Prepare to die!"<p>Ranma grinned as he set about demolishing pig boy, and incidentally the shop they were in.<br/>Before long, Ryouga was out cold from a few thousand punches delivered in a few seconds.<br/>All in all, it was quite a stunning display of martial arts skill.<p>'Honest Wong' however was less than impressed at seeing his shop full of irreplaceable<br/>mystic Chinese junk being wrecked. A frown creased the stately old mans face as he decided<br/>that such impudence would have to be punished. It was a fairly simply matter to pick up the<br/>urn and flick the hidden switch on the bottom which would ensure it only gave out cursed<br/>wishes. "Take urn and go. Never darken my shop again." He announced as he gave Ranma<br/>the discount priced dispenser of wishes.<p>Ranma, being his usual self, failed to notice the shopkeeper's ire as he took hold of the urn<br/>and cried out his wish to the heavens.<p>Reality shifted.<p>***<p>Ranma blinked several times to get the blurriness out of his vision. "What the hell?" He<br/>remarked on seeing that he was currently in a girls bedroom. Judging from the decor he half<br/>expected Azusa Shiratori to burst in at any moment and start naming the various knick<br/>nacks or whatever the hell that kind of cute crap is called.<p>This was promptly followed by the realisation that 'his' voice was several octaves higher than<br/>would be expected for a 'manly man'. "Hey! I'm a girl!" Ranma cried out, noticing her<br/>breasts jutting perkily out as breasts tended to do. She also appeared to be wearing<br/>Doraemon pajama's, although that didn't really bother Ranma since she considered it to be a<br/>fairly unisex anime, even if Nabiki always said it was just for little kids. Besides, despite<br/>being a cat, the talking blue robot with no ears was about as far from feline as you could get.<p>"Hello." A voice came from behind her, judging from how close it sounded, someone was<br/>severely violating her personal space. Being a martial artist trained practically from birth to<br/>be a living weapon, Ranma reacted instantly.<p>"Eeeek!" She shrieked before leaping away and turning to face the intruder. Mere<br/>microseconds later, rationalisation kicked in and Ranma realised that she had only shrieked<br/>like a girl in order to lull the intruder into a false sense of security. Yeah, that's the ticket!<p>"Oh, pardon me, I did not mean to startle you." The man said in a cheerful tone that<br/>indicated he really didn't care.<p>"Who the hell are you? What the hell's going on?" Ranma demanded, her voice laced with<br/>genuine panic. This wish was going way off track!<p>The man bowed with a flourish "Why, I am Xiawang, of course." He announced as if it were<br/>the most obvious thing in the world.<p>Ranma eyed him mistrustfully "Why do you look like Xellos from Slayers then?"<p>"Hmmm..." Xiawang put a finger to his mouth in contemplation "It could be..."<p>"Yes?" In spite of herself, Ranma leaned in closer to hear the answer.<p>"A secret!" He finished brightly.<p>Ranma groaned as she picked herself up from the floor "I guess I asked for that." She<br/>muttered.<p>"Yes, you did. And that's not all you asked for." Xiawang said cheerfully.<p>In a flash Ranma had the man by the throat "Yeah, what the hell happened to my wish?"<br/>She demanded.<p>"Ah, well it seems I was supposed to give you a cursed wish, so you can't expect things to go<br/>too smoothly. The path of a martial artist is fraught with peril and all that." Xiawang tried<br/>unsuccessfully to placate her.<p>"Well why the heck am I a..." Ranma trailed off, a look of dawning horror starting to creep<br/>over her features "You locked it didn't you! I'm stuck as a girl!" She started shaking him<br/>back and forth violently "That's not what I meant! I said 'free of the curse of Nyannichuan'! I<br/>can't be a girl!" She wailed.<p>Xiawang disengaged himself from the distraught former boy and smoothed the creases in his<br/>outfit "Well, that's what happens when you make a wish on a cursed object, but I did fulfill<br/>the wish actually. Ranma Saotome has just finished training at Jusenkyo, and he was not<br/>cursed."<p>"What are you babbling about?" Ranma demanded, despite the fact that she was doing most<br/>of the babbling herself.<p>"You," He pointed dramatically at the redhead "Are the curse of Nyannichuan that Ranma<br/>has been freed of. However, rather than just dumping you in an unfriendly world with<br/>nothing more than the clothes on your back, I have been nice enough to provide you with a<br/>home, and a chance to regain what you lost."<p>"This is my home?" Ranma surveyed her surroundings with an expression of extreme<br/>distaste.<p>"Yes. You are now Ranko Xiawang, student at Furinkan High school, your parents recently<br/>died and left a generous inheritance which should last you until you finish university if you<br/>are careful about your spending. At a young age you were briefly trained by Happosai,<br/>giving you the right to practice Anything Goes, but you have never demonstrated any<br/>aptitude or interest in the martial arts before now."<p>"Hey! I'm Ranma Saotome!" Ranma exclaimed angrilly.<p>"No, Ranma Saotome is currently in China finishing off the last leg of his training journey.<br/>You are not him anymore." Xiawang said forcefully.<p>"Well, why are you giving me all this stuff? Apart from being stuck as a girl, this life sounds<br/>better than what I had before." Ranma commented, visions of a life free of unwanted fiances<br/>flittering through her head. She abruptly shook the thought off, nothing was worth being<br/>stuck as a girl!<p>Xiawang casually buffed his nails on his shirt "I provide a full service wish. Besides,<br/>rewriting history to my whims is fun." He smiled cheerfully.<p>"Well I don't care!" Ranma announced hotly, hands on her hips in a pose of righteous<br/>feminine indignation "Undo it! I don't wanna be stuck as a girl while some other guy gets to<br/>be Ranma."<p>"Tut tut." Xiawang admonished her, waggling a finger in a reproving manner "Things aren't<br/>that simple with cursed wishes. I said you have a chance to regain what was lost, in fact if<br/>you succeed you will be permenantly male and I'll even put you back in that magic shop as<br/>if all this never happened."<p>"What do I gotta do?" Ranma asked, just knowing that the answer would somehow displease<br/>her.<p>Xiawang hmmed and looked thoughtful "Tell me, are you familiar with the fairy tale<br/>'Beauty and the Beast'?"<p>"Never heard of it."<p>"Oh, well the long and the short of it is; a handsome prince is cursed to turn into a hideous<br/>beast - much like that Pantyhose fellow, only permanent - and the only way to break the<br/>curse is to have a woman fall in love with him. But of course, who could love a beast? And<br/>therein lies the dilemma."<p>"So I haveta make some guy fall in love with me?" Ranma clarified, a disgusted expression<br/>on her face. "I don't like it, but I guess it ain't hard, all those perverts used to hit on me when<br/>they knew I was a guy, if I'm a... urk... *real*... girl, then it shouldn't be too hard. I guess."<p>"Oh no, that would be far too simple. No, you have to make a specific person fall in love<br/>with you." By now Xiawang's everpresent smile was threatening to expand across his entire<br/>face.<p>"Who?" That single sylable contained more venom than Ranma had ever put into any word<br/>before in her entire life.<p>"Why, Ranma Saotome of course!"<p>***<p>Chapter 1<p>"What?" Ranma shrieked. "I have to make myself fall in love with me?"<p>"Yes." Xiawang seemed to be enjoying himself immensely "If he were to give you a kiss of<br/>true love *snicker* then it proves he has accepted the Nyannichuan curse - that being you -<br/>and then I'll return you to that magic shop, as a 100% male Ranma. Or you can forget about<br/>it and live the rest of your life as Ranko Xiawang, it's entirely your choice."<p>A battle aura began to shimmer around Ranma, looking somehow incongrous with her cute<br/>Doraemon pajamas. "Ranma Saotome... er... I mean Ranko Xiawang doesn't lose! I'll just<br/>buy one of those koi rods and make him fall in love with me!" She announced, the fires of<br/>determination burning brightly in her eyes.<p>"Oh, that won't do at all." Xiawang commented in a shocked tone "It has to be genuine true<br/>love, it doesn't count if you use magic."<p>"Well pooh." Ranko sat on her bed and crossed her arms huffily "I can still do it easy, after<br/>all, I know myself better than anyone! I just have to become my own perfect woman!"<p>Xiawang patted her on the head in an approving manner "That's the spirit! Well, I must be<br/>off then. Good luck, you won't see me again unless you succeed in winning the love of<br/>Ranma Saotome." He gave a jaunty wave and promptly disappeared.<p>"This sucks." Ranko pouted as she got up and set about exploring her new home. She swiftly<br/>found there was not much to explore, it being a two room apartment. The kitchenette seemed<br/>well stocked, so she brewed up some tea and sat herself at the kotatsu as she considered what<br/>she was going to do.<p>"If Ranma is at Jusenkyo now, then it should be just under a month before he arrives in<br/>Nerima... But if he isn't cursed, won't Shampoo give him the kiss of marriage?" She tried to<br/>figure out how things would go if that happened. She remembered recieving the kiss of death<br/>herself, at a time when she was at her lowest ebb due to the curse. That kiss seemed to wash<br/>all those problems away though, and Ranma had been prepared to pledge his undying love to<br/>the Amazon right there and then. A month of travelling across China being hunted like an<br/>animal had pretty much ruined Shampoo's chances of ever getting together with Ranma<br/>though.<p>It was a similar situation with Akane, when she had initially offered friendship, Ranma had<br/>been ecstatic. Being called a pervert and smashed over the head with a table had done a good<br/>job of ruining that though. Shampoo and Akane had both destroyed Ranma's willingness to<br/>offer his heart to anyone at a time when he was very vulnerable.<p>But an uncursed Ranma is a very different story. He wouldn't be anywhere near as sensitive<br/>about his manhood, nor would he be so desperate for affection. That could make things a<br/>little more difficult for Ranko. On the other hand, the curse had also very thoroughly<br/>desensitised Ranma to girls - it's pretty hard to be impressed with a girl's looks when you<br/>only need a splash of cold water to get a cute girl all to yourself.<p>Ranko snorted. "At least I've got an advantage there, I'm way cuter than any of the fiances."<br/>She muttered inbetween sipping her tea.<p>A look at the clock revealed it was nearly eight o clock in the morning. "What day is it?" she<br/>wondered before remembering the Wedding Peach calender in her room. "I'm gonna have to<br/>redecorate." She promised herself as she went to check the day. It was Saturday. "Guess I'd<br/>best get ready for school." She huffed before donning a Furinkan girls uniform from her<br/>closet.<p>***<p>Ranko arrived early for school and saw a fair number of students were milling about the<br/>grounds, but there was a telling lack of sports equipment clad boys working themselves into<br/>a hormone crazed frenzy. "Looks like Kuno hasn't made that speech yet." She mused before<br/>heading into the main building.<p>Upon entering room 1-F she surreptitously checked the seating chart to find her place; a<br/>window seat just behind Akane's friend Yuka. A few other students had also arrived early<br/>and were clustered around desks chatting amiably, but Ranko was completely ignored as she<br/>made her way to her seat.<p>It was a trend which was maintained throughout the day as Ranko discovered she seemed to<br/>be on the same social level as Gosunkugi. It was actually a refreshing change from the days<br/>when she couldn't break wind without the whole school talking about it and Nabiki setting<br/>up some dumb betting pool on the subject. Besides, it would have been very annoying if the<br/>boys did consider her 'dateable material' - after all, she had to save herself for Ranma *yech*.<p>Pretty soon school ended, it being a Saturday she now had the whole afternoon to herself.<br/>She was just leaving the building when she spotted an altercation forming.<p>"For the last time Kuno, leave me alone!" An irate tomboy yelled. Akane was starting to put<br/>out all the visual cues that Ranko knew indicated severe pain was in the immediate future<br/>for whomever had upset her.<p>"But Akane Tendou, it is written in the stars that our love be true! Only such a fierce tigress<br/>as yourself can be worthy of the Shooting Star of Furinkan High, let us date!" Her would be<br/>suitor professed as he lunged at her for a hug/grope.<p>Ranko snorted in disgust as Kuno was belted across the grounds and smashed into the school<br/>building near her. She was pleased to note that Kuno didn't even acknowledge her presence<br/>as she walked past, when in the past a massive head trauma would never keep him from his<br/>pig tailed girl. "Just hope it stays that way..." She mumbled, suspecting that once she started<br/>making her play for Ranma her desireability among the males of Furinkan would shoot up<br/>just as the universe's way of spiteing her.<p>She returned to her apartment without incident and swiftly disrobed the ugly Furinkan girls<br/>uniform. A quick survey of her closet for some decent casual clothes was rather depressing,<br/>as all she had were a couple of plain skirts and blouses, two frilly (and ugly) dresses and a<br/>yukata that appeared to be several sizes too small. Further exploration of her drawers<br/>eventually turned up a pair of grey cotton sweat pants, which she wore along with a yellow<br/>blouse. Her underwear was all of a simple utilitarian style, which Ranko approved heartily<br/>of - she only had to kiss Ranma before things got back to normal, so fancy lingerie was not<br/>going to be needed.<p>"Time for some clothes shopping I think." Ranko commented to herself, eager to get a better<br/>wardrobe for herself, since even her old collection of female disguise clothes was superior to<br/>what she had now. Of course, she wasn't going to purchase any really feminine garments,<br/>she'd just buy Chinese style clothes similar to what she used to wear.<p>It was with that thought in mind that she was about to leave her apartment when an<br/>important realisation struck her "Wait a minute! How the heck will I win Ranma's love if<br/>I'm some wierd cross-dressin' tomboy?" She then proceeded to spend several minutes cursing<br/>and kicking various inanimate objects around the room. Much as she hated wearing<br/>feminine clothes herself, she definitely preferred girls that dressed properly, so she would<br/>have to dress nicely from now on.<p>Further contemplation opened up another avenue that would work things to her advantage<br/>"Heh, I can kill two birds with one stone." she smirked. She could get someone to help her<br/>pick out nice clothes, and get a counter for the fact that pop would be pushing Ranma to<br/>marry a Tendou.<p>***<p>Ranko stood outside the Saotome residence, dressed in a brand new kimono adorned with an<br/>orchid motif. She had also restyled her hair to let it hang loose and applied a small amount of<br/>makeup. All in all, she was the very picture of decorum and grace.<p>"Man this sucks." She groused, fighting the urge to wipe her face clean of makeup. She took<br/>a deep breath before steeling herself and marching up to ring the doorbell. She had to<br/>restrain herself from fidgeting nervously as she waited for Nodoka to arrive.<p>A few seconds later, Nodoka Saotome opened the door and smiled at her guest "Hello young<br/>lady, is there something I can do for you?" She asked, thinking approvingly of how well<br/>turned out the girl was.<p>"Yes, Saotome-san," Ranko began, bowing formally to the older woman "My name is<br/>Ranko Xiawang. I am looking for Genma Saotome."<p>"Oh..." Nodoka seemed to visibly wilt "You're not a bill collector are you?"<p>It was all Ranko could to to keep the grimace from her face. Damn you pop! She was<br/>furious at her father, guessing correctly that Nodoka had been forced to deal with Genma's<br/>screwups many times before. "No, I am not a bill collector, Saotome-san, but I am a<br/>practitioner of Anything Goes and wished to meet a master of the school."<p>Nodoka perked up a little at that, but was still rather subdued "I am afraid my husband left<br/>on training trip with our son ten years ago. The last letter I recieved from him indicated they<br/>were in China."<p>An opening! "You have a son?" She asked, with just the right amount of interest.<p>"Oh, yes." Nodoka nodded happily before giving Ranko a speculative look "I'd imagine he's<br/>about your age Ranko-chan."<p>"Really?" Ranko paused for a moment as if considering something, when in reality she had<br/>this conversation already planned out "Pardon me for saying so, but you must be lonely<br/>without your family. Perhaps you would like to talk?"<p>Nodoka beamed. Such a considerate and well mannered girl "I'd enjoy the company, Ranko-<br/>chan. Why don't you come in?" She stepped back and waved the younger girl inside.<p>"Thankyou, Saotome-san." Ranko smiled demurely as she enter the house and slipped off<br/>her geta.<p>"Now, now. You can call me auntie." Nodoka admonished gently.<p>***<p>"And here's Ranma when he was three." Nodoka thrust another photo under Ranko's nose<br/>"He was such a rambunctious little boy then, always running around naked like that" She<br/>chuckled merrily.<p>Ranko choked back a sob, it was all she could to to not rip the photo (and all the others with<br/>similarly nude chibi-Ranmas) to pieces and destroy such embarrasing evidence. Still, by<br/>keeping her eyes on the long term goal she was able to control her initial reaction. "Oooh,<br/>he's such a cute little boy!" She squealed with girlish glee "I bet he's really handsome now."<p>"I'm sure he is." Agreed Nodoka before pressing onto a topic she'd been wondering about for<br/>a while "Tell me Ranko-chan, do you have a boyfriend?"<p>"No." Ranko said glumly, affecting a depressed pout.<p>"Why ever not? A pretty young girl like yourself should have the boys flocking to her!"<p>"It's because I'm a martial artist." Ranko explained "Even though I try to be feminine and<br/>nice, most guys are intimidated by me." She sighed forlornly in the manner lovestruck girls<br/>have done throughout the ages "I just wish I could find some handsome, manly man who<br/>practices martial arts and isn't afraid of a strong woman." It was a struggle not to choke on<br/>the 'manly' part.<p>Nodoka got a gleam in her eye. Ranko had impressed her tremendously, being a friendly and<br/>attentive listener for Nodoka to pour out her troubles on, had impeccable manners (Ranko<br/>had made good use of what she learned from martial arts tea ceremony) and seemed to have<br/>a good head on her shoulders. Her interest in martial arts would make her very compatible<br/>with Ranma, and it didn't hurt that she was very pretty - the grandchildren would be<br/>beautiful! "Well Ranko," She began "dearest said that he would take Ranma away for ten<br/>years, and I am actually expecting them back within a few weeks. Perhaps you and Ranma<br/>could get to know one another? I'm sure my son will be a master of Anything Goes himself<br/>by now."<p>"Really?" Ranko's eyes seemed to shimmer as she held her clenched fists under her chin in a<br/>standard 'cute girl' pose that was normally used for scamming free food "I'm so happy!"<p>Nodoka smiled beatifically; her son would be so happy that his mother had found such a<br/>wonderful girl for him "Ranko-chan, would your parents be averse to setting up an omai?"<p>Ranko deflated slightly "My parents recently passed away." She said sombrely.<p>"Oh Ranko-chan! I'm so sorry!" Nodoka embraced the young girl in a comforting hug "Here<br/>you've listened to me complain about missing my family when you've so recently lost your<br/>own."<p>"Th...That's alright auntie." Ranko sniffed, crying tears of happiness just at being able to be<br/>held by her mother like this, though Nodoka misinterpreted the reason for her tears and<br/>made soothing noises as she held Ranko and encouraged her to let it all out.<p>After a few moments Ranko pulled away and Nodoka offered her a tissue. "I'm sorry<br/>auntie," Ranko began as she cleaned herself up "I didn't mean to break down like that."<p>"That's alright dear." Nodoka said, feeling her maternal instincts rising to the surface for this<br/>poor orphan "We all have to let our feelings out from time to time."<p>Ranko spent a few minutes trying to regain her centre, having been caught off guard by the<br/>upsurge of feelings caused by a simple hug. Once she calmed down a little she blamed it on<br/>female hormones and tried to forget it, even if did feel really nice. "Um..." She twiddled her<br/>index fingers nervously "If you're giving me permission to marry your son... can I call you<br/>mother?"<p>Nodoka's smile rivaled the sun "I would be honoured, Ranko-chan."<p>***<p>Chapter 2<p>After spending the previous day shopping with Nodoka, Ranko now stood outside the<br/>Tendou dojo wearing an outfit she had purchased after parting ways with her mother. It was<br/>a kunoichi outfit similar to what Konatsu would normally wear when not waitressing at<br/>Ucchan's (although it rather galled Ranko that she didn't look as good in it as the<br/>crossdressing ninja would). But instead of traditional ninja black, her outfit was a<br/>purple/maroon colour just like Happosai's gi.<p>Following the instructions on the sign in front of the dojo, Ranko went to the rear entrance to<br/>issue her challenge, silently wondering why the heck no one else ever bothered to follow that<br/>simple courtesy in the entire time she had lived with the Tendous.<p>"I have come to challenge for the sign of the Tendou dojo." She announced boldly as she<br/>entered the dojo.<p>"Oh my, a challenger? Wait here and I'll get father." Kasumi, who had been sweeping the<br/>dojo of cement from Akane's practice said before walking into the house. A moment later she<br/>returned with the rest of her family.<p>"What's this? You wish to challenge the Tendou school of Anything Goes martial arts?"<br/>Soun asked, putting up a very convincing stern front.<p>Ranko folded her arms and adopted a haughty demeanour "I am Ranko Xiawang, student of<br/>Anything Goes. I have come to avenge my master."<p>"Master?" Akane looked confused "But you say you practice Anything Goes, and my dad is<br/>the only master." She looked at Soun for confirmation.<p>Ranko gave a cruel smirk "Happosai sends his regards." She said before taking out a small<br/>folding fan and fanning herself.<p>All traces of sterness abruptly vanished from Soun Tendou as he turned into the quivering<br/>wreck Ranko was more familiar with "Don't say his name!" He looked around frantically<br/>presenting warding signs lest the evil master of Anything Goes were to leap out and attack.<p>Kasumi stumbled slightly "Oh my, the strap on my sandal broke, and I just bought them<br/>yesterday..." She said, while several crows dropped dead in midair and plummeted into the<br/>koi pond.<p>"What's this all about daddy?" Nabiki asked, less than impressed with all the theatrics.<p>Since Soun was fast approaching catatonia, Ranko took it upon herself to explain "Ten years<br/>ago, Soun Tendou and his training partner both conspired to seal the grandmaster of the<br/>Anything Goes school in a cave. He recently freed himself, and as his student, I was sent to<br/>take the sign of the Tendou dojo as a small measure of revenge." All lies of course. Ranko<br/>was doing this to weaken the Tendou claim on Ranma, since a dojo with no sign wouldn't<br/>make a very good dowry. She was only mentioning Happosai for the psychological edge.<br/>Well, that and humour value. The old letch was still sealed away, and Ranko planned on<br/>being back in her old life long before his release, so it was impossible to disprove her lie.<p>"Is this true father? Did you seal away your own master?" Kasumi asked, sounding properly<br/>shocked.<p>"You don't understand!" Soun babbled "He was the most evil and perverted creature ever to<br/>walk the earth, we had to get rid of him! Oh, the terrible things he made us do in the name of<br/>training..."<p>Ranko snorted violently at that. As far as she was concerned they had gotten off easy. She'd<br/>never seen any evidence that Soun and Genma had been tossed into pits of starving cats,<br/>been forced to deal with involuntary sex changes, or lived in fear of their own mothers<br/>making them commit seppuku. She should have sealed pop away years ago! "The path of a<br/>true martial artist is fraught with peril." She remarked sardonically.<p>Akane, meanwhile, was staring intently at Ranko, before a look of dawning realisation<br/>crossed her features "Hey! I know you, you're in my class, Reiko Xiawang. But you don't<br/>know any martial arts."<p>Ranko's eyebrow twitched "That's Ranko. And I know more than you think." It was all she<br/>could do not to tack on 'you stupid uncute tomboy!' to the end of that statement.<p>Akane spared a disdainful glance at her father, who was now sobbing incoherently as<br/>Kasumi tried vainly to make him calm down. It was obvious no help would come from<br/>there."Fine, as the heir to the Tendou school of Anything Goes martial arts, I accept your<br/>challenge. Just give me a minute to get changed." Akane ran off and reappered a few<br/>minutes later dressed in her yellow gi.<p>Ranko frowned slightly. She had been hoping to just bully Soun into giving up the sign<br/>without a fight by invoking Happosai's name. On the other hand, she wasn't actually<br/>engaged to Akane right now, and no one would remember any of this once she returned to<br/>her old life. As that thought struck her, she felt a sense of complete freedom - she could do<br/>whatever the hell she liked and none of it would matter since once she kissed Ranma<br/>everything would go back to normal with no one but her remembering any of this. Slowly, a<br/>grin began to spread across her face.<p>Akane took up a standard kempo stance opposite Ranko. Even if she wasn't sure that Ranko<br/>was a martial artist at all, for her to have that effect on her dad indicated that<br/>underestimating her would be foolish. Ranko didn't bother to take a stance, and just<br/>continued fanning herself.<p>Nabiki looked between the two and sighed. It was times like this she was glad to have given<br/>up martial arts, it obviously made people crazy. "Are you both ready?" She asked.<p>"Yes." Akane responded emphatically. Ranko simply inclined her head in a bare nod.<p>Nabiki just shook her head. She knew her little sister was very good, but something about<br/>this Ranko girl unsettled her. Which was odd, since Nabiki made it her business to know<br/>about everyone in her school, and Ranko had always seemed like such a nonoffensive,<br/>shirking violet type. For her to come out and challenge the dojo was passing strange. "This<br/>fight for the sign of the Tendou dojo. Victory is decided by when one of you is unable to<br/>fight or submits. Begin." she announced, stepping swiftly away from the fighters.<p>"Kiai!" Akane shot forward with a thrust kick aimed at Ranko's midsection. Just as it looked<br/>like Akane was about to connect, surely ending the fight in a single powerful blow, Ranko<br/>snapped her fan closed and moved faster than anyone could follow, making use of the old<br/>pervert's pipe trick to send Akane flying into the dojo wall.<p>"Th-that's the Master's technique!" Soun gasped, actually paying attention to his<br/>surroundings now.<p>Akane groggily picked herself and started swaying around the dojo for several seconds<br/>before she regained control "Hey, that doesn't count! I wasn't ready!" She yelled angrilly.<p>Ranko just opened her fan once more to use it for it's original purpose "I'm sorry, I really<br/>shouldn't have countered when you weren't ready, what with your foot about to hit my<br/>sternum and all." She remarked as if commenting on the weather, using the soul of ice to<br/>keep calm even though she was rather shocked at herself for actually hitting the tomboy -<br/>even if it was just a gentle ki enhanced nudge to redirect her momentum.<p>Akane started to fume even more "Well you were using a weapon!"<p>"It is Anything Goes, Akane." Nabiki pointed out not so helpfully, earning a vicious glare<br/>from her little sister.<p>"Alright, this time for real!" Akane exclaimed, tightening her belt before charging back into<br/>the fray, launching a series of high punches and foot sweeps to catch the arrogant redhead off<br/>guard.<p>Ranko of course saw the attacks coming a mile away and deftly evaded each of them. All<br/>she needed now was a manga to read and it would be just like sparring with her own Akane<br/>back home. After a few minutes of this to let Akane tire herself out, Ranko grabbed Akane's<br/>extended foot and tripped her before lunging over her for a knife hand strike which stopped<br/>just before touching Akane's neck, using her own legs to pin the girl she softly asked "Do<br/>you yield?"<p>Akane twitched several times, but was unable to get any leverage to escape. A pained sigh<br/>escaped her lips before she sadly nodded. "You beat me."<p>Ranko gave a small smile, glad that Akane didn't seem too upset and was about to claim her<br/>prize when Soun rediscovered his backbone.<p>"How dare you beat up my little girl! You won't get the dojo sign until you defeat me!" He<br/>roared, having switched from sobbing wreck to overbearing tyrant with no emotional states<br/>inbetween.<p>"Dad! I'm not really hurt!" Akane tried to placate him, mortified that he was implying she<br/>needed protection in front of the girl she had just decided was now her arch rival.<p>"Are you challenging me for my new dojo sign?" Ranko arched an eyebrow towards him,<br/>looking forward to what she was about to do next.<p>"Until you defeat the master of the Tendou school, the sign stays right here!" Soun<br/>announced, assuming a horse stance opposite Ranko.<p>"I see it has come to this. Very well!" Ranko announced dramatically, even though she was<br/>struggling to keep from laughing at what she was about to do "You force me to unleash a<br/>technique of the Anything Goes school so powerful, that the Master himself sealed it away<br/>from the world. But I have uncovered it's horrifying secret!" She reached into her gi and<br/>pulled out a small firecracker "Face the terror of the Anything Goes Final Attack:<br/>Happodaikarin!"<p>And now we witness Soun's emotional rollercoaster shoot right back to 'sobbing wreck' as he<br/>unleashes the only known defence against such a devastating technique. "I'm sorry! I'm<br/>sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" He babbled, moving into the 'Crouch of the<br/>Wild Tiger' and presenting the sign to Ranko "I didn't mean it! Please, take the dojo sign."<p>"What?" Akane exclaimed, genuinely puzzled by this latest development "It's just a little<br/>firecracker?"<p>"You weren't there, Akane!" Soun protested "When the Master used that dreaded<br/>technique... it was truly awful. I shudder to think that it has been unleashed upon the world<br/>once more, but I would rather sacrifice the dojo sign than sacrifice the entire dojo itself!"<p>"Well, I'll just take the sign and be off. Bye!" Ranko grabbed the sign and swiftly departed<br/>the dojo, leaping over the outer wall and making her way to a safe distance before she<br/>unleashed a gale of laughter "Damn! I haven't had that much fun in ages. I guess I can sorta<br/>understand why the old letch treats them like that, they just ask for it!" She remarked<br/>cheerily before a full body shiver ran through her "Understand Happosai? Brrr, I need a<br/>bath!"<p>Meanwhile, back at the Tendou dojo, three concerned daughters were trying to get some<br/>sense out of their father "Okay daddy, who is this Happosai guy that you're so afraid of?"<br/>Nabiki asked.<p>"Don't say his name lest you summon him!" Soun desperately protested.<p>***<p>In a remote part of Japan a large boulder covered with wards on a mountainside abruptly<br/>exploded.<p>***<p>Chapter 3<p>Ranko arrived early for school on Monday morning, still feeling good about her productive<br/>weekend and looking forward to a quiet day at school. Her anonyminity amongst the<br/>students and staff at Furinkan meant she didn't have to worry about perverts trying to hit on<br/>her, and the teachers never called on her for answers. As she entered the school grounds, she<br/>noticed there was a fairly large crowd milling around in anticipation. Curious, she spotted<br/>Daisuke and went to ask him what was going on. "Hey, Daisuke, what's all this fuss<br/>about?" she jerked a thumb towards the crowd<p>Daisuke started slightly at being addressed so informally by a girl and turned to face her<br/>"Oh, Xiawang-san, it's..." He trailed off and stared as if seeing her for the first time.<p>Ranko fidgeted nervously under his scrutiny "What? Somethin' on my face?"<p>"Oh... ah... no." He shook his head "Did you do something with your hair?"<p>Ranko blanched. He was noticing her! This could ruin everything! "Yeah, I took it outta the<br/>pigtail." She averted her eyes hoping to avoid encouraging him, but only succeeded in<br/>looking even more adorable "Anyway, what's everyone so-" She was cut off as a new voice<br/>rang out across the school.<p>"Reiko Xiawang! I challenge you!"<p>Much eyebrow twitching. "That's Ranko!" She yelled back at Akane, who had now arrived<br/>and was the centre of attention.<p>Akane blushed before regaining her righteous fury "Whatever! I have come to challenge you<br/>to regain the sign of the Tendou dojo!"<p>Much whispering broke out among the students. "Akane's fighting Ayanami?" "The poor<br/>girl's gonna get creamed!" "I never knew Akane was a bully!" "What's that about a sign?<br/>Did she steal it or something?"<p>Ranko twitched even more as she heard several people refer to her as 'Ayanami'. Man, this<br/>girl musta had a pathetic life before I came along...<p>Nabiki of course was now taking multitudes of bets on Akane beating up Ranko, and<br/>looking forward to making a killing.<p>"Why are you challenging me? This is a school!" Ranko protested plaintatively, desperate to<br/>avoid showing her skills, which would undoubtedly result in Kuno deciding she was his<br/>'fierce tigress' or whatever.<p>"I don't know where you live..." Akane muttered, sounding slightly embarrased. "So are we<br/>going to fight?"<p>At the lack of action, discussion throughout the schoolyard switched topics. At least between<br/>the boys anyway "Hey, does Ranko look different to you?" "Yeah, she seems... well,<br/>hotter!" "How come we never noticed before?" "I hear ya buddy. She might be short, but<br/>she's got huge-"<p>"HEY!" Ranko turned a murderous glare on the boy that said the last remark, who instantly<br/>shrank back and decided new underwear might be in order.<p>"Stop ignoring me!" Akane stamped her foot petulantly "I'm issuing a dramatic challenge<br/>here!"<p>Ranko pinched the bridge of her nose. This could not be happening to her! "Look Akane, I<br/>beat you yesterday. Unless you've done some incredible training over the past sixteen hours,<br/>there's no point in us fighting."<p>"You were lucky!" Akane shot back. "Are you going to accept my challenge or are you a<br/>coward?"<p>"What did you call me?" Ranko asked, a hard edge to her voice.<p>"A coward! You're chicken, Ayanami!" Akane started flapping her arms like wings and<br/>making clucking noises.<p>Kuno had appeared now and was yammering on about 'permitting no other terms' for<br/>something or other, but everyone's attention was on the current spectacle, so he was ignored.<p>While initally offended at the accusation of cowardice, Ranko was now in a state of shock as<br/>she boggled at Akane's impromptu barnyard animal impression. She knew she was being<br/>insulted, but Akane seemed to be making herself look pretty stupid too. Still, an insult was<br/>an insult. "Consider your challenge accepted." She beckoned Akane onwards and gave an<br/>arrogant smirk that always pissed her opponent off.<p>Akane charged forward with an agressive high kick towards the redhead that momentarily<br/>stunned Ranko as she was treated to a great view of the tomboy's panties. No wonder those<br/>guys fought her every morning... was her single coherent thought before it connected.<p>"Oh my god! Akane killed her!" one girl screamed as Ranko dropped like a sack of bricks.<p>"Ha! I knew I'd win!" Akane cheered and posed triumphantly "Still... I expected more of a<br/>challenge..." She turned away from her downed foe and noticed everyone looking at her in<br/>varying degrees of shock "What?" She asked, genuinely puzzled.<p>"H.. how could you, Akane?" Sayuri gasped out.<p>"What? It was a martial arts duel." Akane protested, all innocence.<p>"You can't go around beating people up and just saying it's okay 'cause it's a martial arts<br/>duel!" Yuka yelled angrily at her apparently psychotic friend.<p>Nabiki, meanwhile was in shock for a different reason, as she had expected Ranko to win,<br/>which would have earned her a tidy sum from the betting pools. Just as she was starting to<br/>formulate plans for revenge, she noticed Ranko rising, seeming none the worse for the wear.<br/>"Fight's not over, little sis!" She called out cheerfully.<p>Akane barely had time to turn around before Ranko seemed to blur and Akane dropped<br/>unconscious. Ranko then sniffed haughtily and marched into the school building.<p>"Wow, I barely saw her move!" Hiroshi commented.<p>Nabiki felt a warm and fuzzy feeling wash over her as she realised all the money taken was<br/>hers since no one had bet on Ranko. She hugged the wad of bills to her busom with a<br/>contented smile on her face. Then she realised she'd better check on her little sister and went<br/>over to drag Akane to the nurse's office. "Hmmm... uncute?" She read the lettering on<br/>Akane's forehead, made from a large number of tiny bruises joined together.<p>As everyone proceeded in to school, Kuno was left in the schoolyard. "Right then," He said,<br/>sounding less sure of himself than normal due to the lack of reaction to his stirring and<br/>emphatic speech "So we're all going to attack Akane Tendou tomorrow for the privelege of<br/>dating her...?"<p>"I'm with you sempai!" A sickly sounding voice spoke up, belonging to none other than<br/>Gosunkugi - the only person to have payed any attention to the 'Shooting Star of Furinkan<br/>High'.<p>***<p>Ranko trudged home after a very stressful day at school. She had hoped that her demolition<br/>of Akane, coupled with her past unpopularity, would have put the guys off. Instead she had<br/>to put up every boy in her class, and a few from others, hitting on her throughout lunch.<p>Then there was the way Akane and her friends glared at her every chance they got. Sure,<br/>writing 'uncute' on the tomboy's forehead was maybe a little bit over the top, but she should<br/>be able to take a joke. Besides, it was fair payment for landing that cheap shot by flashing<br/>her panties "And she calls me a pervert!" She remarked huffily.<p>On the plus side, Kuno was still unaware of her existence, though she had expected him to<br/>go nuts after hearing about Akane's defeat, she hadn't seen him all day. Still, it was small<br/>consolation. Right now all she wanted to do was drop off her school stuff and then pay a visit<br/>to the bathhouse for a nice relaxing soak. After that maybe she'd go and visit mom for some<br/>cooking lessons or something. It was nice being able to spend time with her without having<br/>to worry about a splash of hot water and the resulting disembowelment that would follow.<br/>She still yearned to be with Nodoka as her son, but she'd take what she could get.<p>She arrived at her home and changed into a blue and yellow yukata that she had bought the<br/>other day. Looking around her room, she made a mental note to purchase a futon or bedroll,<br/>since the western style bed felt wierd to her and was difficult to sleep in. But that, and<br/>redecorating, could wait for another day. She was far too tightly wound right now, and just<br/>wanted to relax.<p>After arriving at the bathhouse she realised a fatal flaw in her 'relaxation plan'; she was<br/>surrounded by acres of hot, naked, nubile female flesh. Sure, she turned into a girl, but that<br/>didn't mean she was dead!<p>Rinsing herself off while very carefully not paying attention to her surroundings, she then<br/>went over to an isolated corner of the sentou and closed her eyes, just letting the warm water<br/>relax her. After a few minutes she heard someone else getting in the bath near her. Opening<br/>her eyes it was all she could do not to gag. What the hell was Kodachi Kuno doing here?<p>Ranko then realised that even if Kodachi's leotards left little to the imagination, seeing the<br/>Black Rose in all her naked glory was something else entirely. She quickly averted her eyes,<br/>but not before Kodachi noticed her scrutiny.<p>"Is there something I can do for you?" She asked in an amused tone.<p>"Um..er..." Ranko began uncertainly, doing everything she could to not look at the feast of<br/>feminine pulchitrude before her "Aren't you Kodachi Kuno?" She finished lamely.<p>"Indeed I am. No doubt you are wondering why a member of the noble house of Kuno<br/>would frequent such a plebian establishment?"<p>I wouldn't have put it like that, but... "Yes?" Ranko said, wondering if Kodachi was going to<br/>pull out a ribbon and go off on her 'Black Rose' spiel. Then she wondered where she'd pull<br/>the ribbon from and promptly derailed that train of thought.<p>"We are having problems with the plumbing at the Kuno estate, and rather than wait for<br/>them to be fixed, I decided to avail myself of this establishment." She sighed in a put upon<br/>manner "It has been a most stressful day."<p>"What happened?" Ranko asked, wondering why she was continuing this conversation when<br/>all reason dictated she should get the hell away from the rose obsessed psycho.<p>"Since you know who I am, no doubt you are familiar with my status as rythmic gymnastic<br/>champion for this region?" Kodachi didn't wait for a response before continuing "I was<br/>engaging in some enthusiastic sparring with a rival team prior to our match this week, when<br/>this most ill mannered little trollop comes along and steals my ribbon. Naming it<br/>'Martinique' of all things."<p>Ranko valiantly supressed her urge to laugh at this, although it did lighten her mood<br/>considerably.<p>"Anyway," Kodachi continued, not noticing Ranko's barely concealed mirth "I attempted to<br/>reason with her," by throwing explosive medicine balls and paralysis gas sachets "before this<br/>handsome but perverted brute happens along and retrieves my ribbon. I was initially grateful<br/>of course, but then he tried to molest me!"<p>Ranko actually felt some sympathy for Kodachi at this, having been in a similar situation<br/>herself. "I hope you taught him a lesson."<p>Kodachi smiled wickedly "But of course. I made use of a hallucinogenic agent to dampen<br/>his ardour. Right now I imagine he's still running around trying to stop the clowns from<br/>eating him." Kodachi let loose a burst of her trademark psychotic laugh, and for once Ranko<br/>laughed with her, pleased that the pervert Sanzennin had gotten his comeuppance.<p>Their amusement was interrupted when screaming began to come from the other end of the<br/>bathhouse. Both girls stood up and glanced around, wondering what was going on before<br/>Ranko suddenly started shivering uncontrollably.<p>"Are you alright?" Kodachi put an arm around Ranko, sounding genuinely concerned.<p>"I... sense... evil..." She gasped out before a small blur appeared and landed on her chest,<br/>resolving into a familiar figure.<p>"Hotcha!"<p>***<p>Chapter 4<p>Seeing the perverted little homunculi attached to her breasts, Ranko acted completely out of<br/>habit and instinct before her shock at his early arrival could set in.<p>"A most impressive punch." Kodachi noted dryly, looking at the hole in the ceiling caused<br/>by Happosai's departure.<p>"Happosai... how could he be here?" Ranko wondered, slightly dazed and not hearing<br/>Kodachi, or the other women who were cheering her victory over the molester.<p>"Pardon? You know that... creature?" Kodachi asked, giving Ranko a suspicious look.<p>Ranko seemed to centre herself before facing Kodachi, being very careful to keep her gaze<br/>above the other girl's neck "I wish I didn't, trust me. I never expected him to show up here."<br/>At least not yet, she added silently. "I'm gonna have to go and find him. It was nice talkin' to<br/>ya, Kodachi." She gave the taller girl a wave as she rose from the bath and went to get<br/>dressed.<p>Kodachi smirked "Nice? I am the Black Rose of St Hebereke, nothing concerning me is ever<br/>'nice' I assure you." She twirled her ribbon, releasing a storm of black rose petals and<br/>laughing maniacally.<p>Ranko paused and gave Kodachi an odd look "Where did that ribbon come from?"<p>Kodachi stumbled slightly and hid the ribbon behind her back, blushing furiously "Don't you<br/>have somewhere to be?" She suggested nervously.<p>"Um... right..." Ranko offered uncertainly "See ya around Kodachi."<p>***<p>"So, did Tofu-sensei make all your hurts go away? Did he kiss your booboo all better?"<br/>Nabiki teased her sister as the pair made their way home from school after Akane had<br/>insisted on making a detour to doctor Tofu's practice. Personally, Nabiki felt that if she ever<br/>had an insulting bruise on her forehead she'd do everything possible to avoid the object of<br/>her affections, but Akane seemed to feel otherwise.<p>"Shut up, Nabiki!" Akane hissed, looking around in terror of anyone overhearing and<br/>discovering her oh so secret crush.<p>Nabiki just laughed at Akane's discomfort before they were both distracted by a tiny old man<br/>falling out of the sky and making an impressive crater. Even more surprising was that he<br/>immediately got up seeming none the worse for wear.<p>"That redhead packed a mean wallop." He commented admiringly as he dusted himself off.<p>"Are you alright mister? Do you need us to take you to the doctor?" Akane asked, only<br/>slightly concerned for the old timers wellbeing.<p>"Any excuse, eh Akane?" Nabiki snorted.<p>The wrinkled little gnome looked up at the pair and grinned "All I need to feel better is a<br/>good hug!" before promptly attaching himself barnacle like to Akane's chest.<p>Akane screamed and hit him several times before he was dislodged "How dare you! You<br/>wretched little pervert! Who the hell do you think you are?" She raged furiously.<p>"Why I'm Happosai, the grandmaster of the Anything Goes school of martial arts!" The little<br/>man puffed himself up proudly at that announcement.<p>"Happosai? As in the guy that taught our dad?" Akane clarified, as if there was more than<br/>one grandmaster of Anything Goes named Happosai.<p>Happosai gave her a look with a bit more interest than his previous casual lechery "So...<br/>you're one of Soun's girls are you?"<p>Akane nodded eagerly, her previous anger forgotten - he could teach her to beat that upstart<br/>Ranko after all! "I'm Akane Tendou and this is my sister Nabiki." she said by way of<br/>introduction before naively adding "One of your students took our dojo sign yesterday, can<br/>we have it back?"<p>"One of my students defeated the Tendou dojo?" Happosai seemed rather surprised at that<br/>news "Which one?"<p>"Ranko Xiawang. She said it was as revenge for what our dad did when he sealed you<br/>away." Akane offered, Nabiki seeming content to stay silent and observe.<p>Happosai's pupils expanded to cover his entire eyes and started to shimmer "Lil' Ranko-chan<br/>avenged me? Oh happy day! I bet she grew up to be a real cutie too!"<p>"The boys at school seem to think so." Nabiki finally joined the conversation, sensing a<br/>chance to glean some info "You say you haven't seen her since she was a little girl?"<p>Happosai nodded cheerfuly "I didn't expect her to even remember me, but I can remember<br/>like it was yesterday..."<p>***<p>Chibi-Ranko was sitting by herself in a park, crying. Along came Happosai, looking tall and<br/>bishonen, despite this only being ten years ago. Even if he was an evil pervert, Happosai still<br/>can't stand to see little children unhappy, so he went over to comfort Ranko "What's wrong<br/>little girl?" He asked, kneeling down before her.<p>Ranko sniffed a few times before answering "Everyone hates me. They say I'm a 'filthy ai no<br/>ko' because momma's from China." she sobbed wretchedly.<p>Happosai frowned "They're just stupid then!" he declared emphatically "I once knew a girl<br/>from China, and she was the most beautiful and wonderful woman I'd ever met. I would<br/>have married her too!"<p>"Why didn't you?" Ranko asked, her tears forgotten as she listened to the nice old man.<p>Happosai fidgeted nervously "Well... she got a little upset with me one day for some reason<br/>and chased me out her village. But I've still got a special place in my heart for her." He<br/>decided to change the subject "Anyway, a lot of people are just stupid and will hate you for<br/>no good reason. Why, some people even hate me!"<p>"But you're nice!" Ranko protested vehemently.<p>Happosai nodded sadly "It's true... but some people just cannot understand the great task I<br/>have been assigned by destiny. It was because of my sacred mission that I lost the only<br/>woman I ever loved..."<p>"What mission?" Ranko asked, enthralled by this story.<p>"Oh it is such a noble task! I must liberate all of my precious silky darlings!" The stunningly<br/>bishonen Happosai pontificated, raising his fist to the heavens as the sunset framed him like<br/>the hero out of some samurai drama.<p>"Wow." The little girl breathed, obviously impressed "I like silk. Can I help your mission?"<br/>She asked hopefully.<p>Happosai considered her for a moment before nodding "Y'know, those two ingrate students<br/>of mine will never amount to anything... perhaps I need a new student. Besides, you kind of<br/>remind me of Cologne-chan. What's your name little girl?"<p>"Ranko Xiawang!" She announced happily, all smiles now.<p>***<p>"But I was barely a few weeks into training little Ranko-chan when those idiots Soun and<br/>Genma got me drunk and sealed me in that cave..." He trailed off sullenly before brightening<br/>again "But I'm glad Ranko hasn't slacked off in her training, I'll have to find her! Either of<br/>you two girls know where she lives nowadays?"<p>Akane just stared forward twitching slightly "Silky... darlings...?" she mumbled.<p>Nabiki was able to retain her presence of mind however, and reacted in her usual manner to<br/>a request for information "That will cost you five thousand yen." She held a hand out<br/>expectantly.<p>"Oh, to think you'd charge an old man who's been sealed away in a cold dark cave for ten<br/>long years!" He wailed theatrically "What has the younger generation come to? Let me have<br/>a good cry in your busom!"<p>"Ack! Get it off! Get it off!" Nabiki abruptly lost her calm and collected demeanour as she<br/>vainly tried to swat Happosai was groping her with wild abandon.<p>"I'll leave if you tell me where to find my student." Happosai suggested.<p>"Fine!" Nabiki yelled before rattling off the address she had discovered today while trying to<br/>find out more about Ranko.<p>"That wasn't so hard now was it?" Happosai consoled before bounding off, a certain white<br/>item of clothing dangling behind him.<p>"Oneechan... isn't that..." Akane pointed uncertainly after the dwindling figure of Happosai.<p>Nabiki herself noticed she seemed to be a lot less... restrained... around the chest. "My bra!<br/>I'll kill him!" She shrieked, filled with impotent fury.<p>***<p>"Well, that was a bust." Ranko muttered as she returned home from her fruitless search for<br/>Happosai. She was about to make a start on her dinner when she heard noises coming from<br/>her bedroom. Grinning maliciously, she popped her knuckles in anticipation. Time to work<br/>off her frustrations on the idiot that thought he could steal from her! "Oh burglar-san..." She<br/>caroled sweetly before kicking the door in violently.<p>What she saw froze her in her tracks.<p>Pile of all her bras and panties in centre of room. Check.<p>Big green sack, overflowing with womens underwear, placed by window. Check.<p>Tiny wrinkled gnome pawing through her unmentionables while making disappointed<br/>sounding noises. Check.<p>"What the hell?" She roared angrily.<p>Happosai looked up at her and tutted "Ranko-chan, I'm very disappointed in you! For a<br/>practictioner of Anything Goes martial arts, your collection is pitiful!" He indicated the pile<br/>of her underwear "It's all plain and cotton! I only got out of that cave yesterday and already<br/>my collection is better!" He indicated his own 'panty raid' sack. Then he emptied said sack<br/>on the floor "Tell you what, you sort through my collection and take anything you like, just<br/>to get your own collection started properly." He looked momentarily distraught "Just don't<br/>say your old master doesn't do anything for you."<p>Of all the reactions Ranko could have expected, this was not one of them. Though in<br/>retrospect, maybe she should have. "What's going on?" She asked weakly, showing none of<br/>the force her earlier declaration had.<p>"I'm here to resume your training of course! We've got so many silky darlings to liberate, it'll<br/>be just like we planned all those years ago!" He pointed to the Tendou dojo sign which was<br/>currently propped up against the wall "I appreciate that you've kept up your training and<br/>taken Soun to task for his crimes against me, but never forget the TRUE purpose of<br/>Anything Goes."<p>Don't ask, don't ask, don't ask... "What purpose is that?"<p>Happosai blinked, not expecting her to have forgotten such a fundamental tenet of the school<br/>"To liberate all the silky darlings which are being unjustly kept away from me of course!"<p>Well, you had ta ask, Ranko thought as she slumped bonelessly to the floor.<p>Happosai seemed puzzled at her reaction "Come on Ranko-chan, you used to get so excited<br/>when we talked about this, remember?" He cajoled "Remember how we planned to always<br/>stick together, as comrades in arms, as master and student, friends forever!"<p>"Wha?" Ranko was dimly aware that she should be sobbing hysterically at this point, but she<br/>was just too out of it. That reaction would have to wait, for now she'd settle for stupified<br/>shock.<p>"By the way Ranko-chan, we'll have to find a bigger house to keep our collections in." He<br/>eyed her single bed for a moment before returning his attention to the stunned redhead "Until<br/>then, I guess you should know that I can only spoon on my right side."<p>***<p>Chapter 5<p>Ranko paused in her eating as she studied the ancient lecher sitting opposite her, currently<br/>absorbed in the process of gorging himself on her teriyaki chicken and rice. If she took him<br/>by surprise with an all out attack, holding absolutely nothing back and employing every<br/>dirty trick she knew, then she might just be able to kill him.<p>With a force of will, she shook off the idle fantasy. She was not a killer, and Happosai hadn't<br/>really done much to actually piss her off yet. Aside from the incident at the sentou he hadn't<br/>even made any attempt to grope her. It was certainly odd to deal with Happosai giving her<br/>the same amount of respect he normally gave Kasumi, and having the old perv on her side<br/>might prove useful - aside from Cologne he was probably the greatest living repository of<br/>martial arts knowledge in the world. If she played her cards right, he would be a powerful<br/>ally.<p>On the other hand, once he started up with his panty raids (although his big green sack<br/>indicated he had already started) and her association with him became common knowledge,<br/>her image would suffer greatly. In truth Ranko cared little for the perceptions of others, even<br/>more so than usual since no one would remember this once she returned to her old life, but<br/>she was unsure how Ranma would react to Happosai. Without the nyannichuan curse,<br/>Ranma would suffer a lot less under the old man's depredations, but Happosai was still<br/>pretty much inherently unlikeable, and would likely still torment Genma's son out of<br/>principal.<p>Since that would hamper her efforts to make Ranma fall in love with her, she decided it<br/>would be best if she wasn't associated too closely with him. But how to get rid of him<br/>without making him an enemy?<p>Not having any inkling of the direction of his favoured student's thoughts, Happosai released<br/>a loud belch before speaking "That was delicious, Ranko-chan! You sure know how to treat<br/>an old man right." he entused over her cooking.<p>Aha! Inspiration strikes! "Y'know, I'm not really all that good a cook. Kasumi Tendou is far<br/>better than I am. Maybe you should drop in on the Tendou's for a while... see if Soun hasn't<br/>lost his skills?" She said with an innocent 'butter wouldn't melt' expression on her angelic<br/>features.<p>Happosai waved her off dismissively before rubbing his stomach in contentment "Bah!<br/>Forget that ingrate, why would I want to waste my time with those losers."<p>"Because he has three beautiful teenage daughters? Not to mention all that space in the dojo<br/>for you to keep your collection?" She offered helpfuly.<p>"I bet none of them are as beautiful as you are, Ranko-chan!" Happosai retorted<br/>passionately.<p>Ranko blinked in surprise. She was used to compliments on her looks, but normally<br/>Happosai would glomp her after a statement like that. Why the heck am I blushing? She<br/>thought on feeling her face heat up. Giving herself a mental shake, she decided to give up on<br/>foisting him off on the Tendou's, which left plan B - wear him out so he'll be too tired for any<br/>panty raids in the near future "Seeing as you've been gone for so long, maybe we should<br/>have a sparring match so you can see how I've improved?"<p>***<p>"Boy Ranko, you look awful." Yuka remarked on seeing the redhead blearily stagger into<br/>class just before the warning bell the next morning.<p>"Bidah!" Ranko spared the other girl a baleful glance through bloodshot eyes and stuck out<br/>her tongue before collapsing into her seat and trying to catch some sleep.<p>A few hours later she was roused upon hearing a ruckus outside as the girls gym class ran<br/>screaming after a panty thief. "Energetic little bastard..." she grumbled half heartedly.<p>In truth she was actually pretty happy. Even if her plan failed, and she suffered a blow to her<br/>pride as Happosai had more energy than her, last night's sparring had been immensely<br/>satisfying. Normally her fights with Happosai were fairly short, with one of them using some<br/>stupid dirty trick to beat the other, but last night they had battled for hours, going nearly all<br/>out. The old perv had even critiqued her form and offered some useful pointers for<br/>improvement. He had observed some similarities in her style compared with the Saotome<br/>school, but since her style had been evolving differently from Genma's over the past few<br/>years it wasn't anything major. He had also seemed inordinately pleased with the Amazon<br/>influence in her style, commenting that she reminded her of his 'dear Cologne-chan'.<p>It was in the wee hours of the morning when they had finally called a halt to their sparring,<br/>and she had barely posessed enough energy to kick him out of her room when they returned<br/>home. No way in hell was Happosai sleeping with her, even if he was a lot more tolerable.<p>"Well Ranko, aren't you going to do soemthing about your master stealing girls' underwear?<br/>Or are you a pervert too?" The snippy voice of an irate tomboy interrupted her recollections,<br/>causing everyone else in the class to draw shocked gasps.<p>The tired redhead made an unsucessful attempt at stifling a yawn before turning her<br/>attention to Akane "He's your master too Akane." She pointed out.<p>Akane didn't have a verbal reply, but her expression screamed out 'Crap! I never thought of<br/>that!' and turned the attention of the class back on her.<p>"Are all martial artists perverts or something?" One girl asked.<p>"Would explain Kuno." Hiroshi snorted.<p>"And it would explain what happened at our last sleepover at Akane's." Sayuri put in,<br/>earning a sage nod from Yuka.<p>"Yeah, no one's that clumsy. I mean honestly, the way she kept spilling juice on our<br/>pajamas'."<p>Akane was standing in mute horror as the tide turned against her, while Ranko chose to<br/>ignore them and go back to sleep. Which is a pity as she would have been incredibly<br/>amused/disturbed at what came next.<p>"I didn't want to say anything, but I noticed an ecchi magazine under Akane's mattress..."<br/>Miyo joined the debate "It was really disgusting, I think it was called Chicks with-"<p>"Ahahaha! We don't need to talk about that!" Akane shot over and clamped a hand over<br/>Miyo's mouth before she could finish that damning statement, but the damage was done. She<br/>turned a burning glare on the blissfuly snoring redhead "Damn you Reiko - I mean Ranko<br/>Xiawang! For the insult of the porn, I will make you pay!" She cried out to the heavens,<br/>which only resulted in a blackboard eraser being thrown at her head.<p>"Tendou, buckets, hall." The teacher reprimanded her.<p>"Hai sensei." Akane went off to do her punishment, all the while boiling with rage towards<br/>the new bane of her existence.<p>***<p>"Good afternoon Ranko-chan, how was school?" A jovial voice greeted the former boy as<br/>she returned home that day.<p>"It was okay." She shrugged noncommitaly before taking in the sight before her. Her entire<br/>apartment was festooned with womens' underwear hanging from every surface. Kneeling by<br/>the kotatsu, Happosai was humming cheerfuly as he ironed the creases out of some panties.<br/>"You don't suppose you could lay off on the panty raids for a bit?" She asked hopefuly.<p>Happosai snorted "You may as well ask me to stop breathing."<p>"Only if I thought it would work..." She muttered under her breath.<p>"What was that?"<p>"Nothing! I was just thinking that maybe since my apartment obviously isn't big enough to<br/>hold all of your silky darlings, maybe you should move somewhere else... like say, the<br/>Tendou dojo?"<p>"Nonsense!" Happosai scoffed "I've already had a look around the neighbourhood and seen a<br/>few big houses for sale we could move into."<p>Ranko placed both hands on her hips and glared down at the diminuitive pervert,<br/>unconsciously adopting the 'nagging housewife' position "If you think I'm forking out my<br/>cash just so you can have a place to keep yer panties you can think again!"<p>"Oh ye of little faith. I can easily afford to buy a house for us both. If you live long enough<br/>you don't have to work for your money to increase." Happosai said sagely before picking up<br/>a pair of pink panties and rubbing them over his face.<p>Ranko paused in her tirade. That made sense, but... "Then what's with all the stealin' and<br/>skippin' out on bills?"<p>Happosai blinked "Training of course." He studied her carefuly for a moment "You know<br/>Ranko, while I was very impressed with your skills last night, it seems that you've forgotten<br/>many of the fundamental tenets of the art."<p>Ranko sighed and rubbed her temples. "Whatever. I'm going to visit mom, you can put that<br/>wealth of yours to use by eating out tonight."<p>"Your mother? Why aren't you living with your parents?" Happosai asked curiously.<p>"Huh? Oh, right... yeah..." Ranko hedged for a moment before remembering the fiction<br/>surrounding her life "My parents are dead, I'm going to visit Mrs Saotome. She lets me call<br/>her mom since I'm kinda engaged to her son."<p>"Saotome..." Happosai considered this for a moment before his eyes got really big "As in<br/>Nodoka? Genma's wife? You're engaged to Ranma?"<p>"Yeah, that's the one." She confirmed.<p>"Oh, well good luck with that. Off you go then." Happosai shooed her out the door before<br/>sitting down in thought, idly lighting up his pipe "I thought Soun and Genma were going to<br/>marry their kids to take over that dojo of Soun's? I wonder what happened?"<p>***
