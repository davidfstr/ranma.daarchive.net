</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 14<p>The short sylph-like girl looked in the mirror and took in her appearance. Alarmingly red<br/>hair, tied back into a simple pigtail, an oversized red Chinese style shirt that did little to<br/>conceal her figure or the fact that she wasn't wearing a bra, baggy kung fu trousers<br/>securely tied around her slim waist. Clear skin showed a natural beauty that needed no<br/>makeup to enhance it while amazingly blue eyes like purest sapphire looked back<br/>despondently from the reflection, showing none of the spark or zest they usually evoked.<p>Hesitantly, almost as if she were afraid she might shatter the mirror, the young girl raised<br/>a hand to touch its glassy surface, her reflection doing the same to meet her palm.<p>"Ranma..."<p>She breathed that single word in a soft voice filled with a curious mix of reverence, hope<br/>and pain.<p>"I'm Ranma..."<p>***<p>"So, you wanna see how worthy I am do ya?" Ranma popped his knuckles while glaring<br/>down at the little troll who claimed to be the grandmaster of his school, doing a<br/>surprisingly good job of hiding the fact that he was almost ready to soil himself from the<br/>terrifying intensity of Happosai's aura.<p>"And I can already tell you I'm not impressed!" Happosai jabbed his pipe in Ranma's<br/>direction "A true student of Anything Goes would show proper respect to his master, you<br/>snot nosed little punk!"<p>What little patience Ranma posessed evaporated on his rebuking by this obviously senile<br/>(but pretty scary) old coot. "Oh yeah? Well respect this!" He shot forward with speed and<br/>skill borne from a lifetime of rigorous training in the martial arts. His fist arced towards<br/>Happosai in a powerful (but only incapacitating, not fatal) blow.<p>Only Happosai wasn't there any longer.<p>"That all you got?" A taunting voice came from behind him, causing Ranma to quickly<br/>whirl round and adopt a more defensive stance.<p>He's fast... Ranma thought in grudging respect, still, he'd battled people who were faster<br/>than him before, the trick was just to find the pattern in their attacks. If you know what<br/>they're going to do next, it doesn't matter how fast they are. "I see a whole lot of<br/>posturing, but I don't see any action old man!" he retorted, hoping to goad the geezer into<br/>making a mistake.<p>Happosai purpled with rage, then sprang into action, faster than Ranma could react. He<br/>leapt around the boy's defence, striking all over Ranma's body, whenever Ranma tried to<br/>counter, the tiny grandmaster would already be hitting a vulnerable spot somewhere else<br/>on his body.<p>"Had enough yet?" Happosai sneered, now standing on the prone Ranma's chest.<p>"Grr...It ain't over yet old man!" Ranma growled, throwing a vicious punch at his elderly<br/>foe, but like before, Happosai was easily able to evade by leaping backwards off of<br/>Ranma's body.<p>Picking himself up, Ranma wobbled slightly before firming his stance and spitting out<br/>some blood. The old man had worked him over good, his entire body felt like one<br/>massive bruise, but he'd be damned if he'd lie over for this old bastard. He lifted his chin<br/>proudly and beckoned Happosai to attack once more.<p>"So you do have spirit..." Happosai noted, a tone of grudging respect in his voice, then he<br/>once more sprung at Ranma and yelled "I'll just have to beat it out of you!"<p>***<p>Ranma-chan considered taking a backpack full of camping supplies, but discarded the<br/>notion. She was just going to another district in Tokyo, not out into the wilderness, even<br/>if she was going to tell everyone it was a 'training trip'.<p>In a sense it was training. She needed a refresher course on her true identity. She needed<br/>to BE Ranma once more, even girl-type Ranma, for just a little while. She'd had to play<br/>the role of a girl before, for fooling Ryouga and Kuno - which was just harmless fun, to<br/>the far more serious (and heartbreaking) task of pretending to be Ranko Tendou. But<br/>never had she immersed herself in the life of a girl for so long, and to such a degree.<br/>Ranko Tendou was a tomboy who bucked convention and did what she liked - and what<br/>she liked most was making her 'auntie Saotome' smile. Ranko Xiawang was a proper<br/>young lady who just happened to practice martial arts and wanted nothing more than to<br/>be a good wife for her arranged fiance.<p>Ranko.<p>She hated that name, a feminine bastardisation of who she really was, it was a symbol of<br/>all she was not. All she had lost because of that wretched training ground known as<br/>Jusenkyo.<p>Every time she played Ranko Tendou, smiling with false cheer as she told a lonely<br/>woman that her son had 'just left on a training trip' a little part of her died. There were<br/>times when she just wanted to end it all, to tip a kettle over her head and stop the charade<br/>of Ranko and her pet panda before throwing herself on her mother's mercy.<p>Akane believed she would not do that out of a simple fear of seppuku. She was wrong.<p>Ritual suicide held little fear for someone who had survived the terror of the Neko-ken<br/>training. No, what really terrified her was seeing the disapointment and perhaps even<br/>anger on her mothers face. Could she really betray Nodoka's memories of a young boy<br/>who promised to grow into a man among men? Death would be a blessing after doing<br/>something like that to her beloved mother.<p>***<p>Ranma backpedaled furiously as he tried to ward off Happosai's lightning fast offensive.<br/>Any thought of counterattacking was gone as he was forced to concentrate everything he<br/>had on simple defence. However, even if he was currently unable to take any offensive<br/>action, he was taking careful note of the patterns Happosai was using in his attack.<br/>Sooner or later he'd be able to take advantage of that - if only the old freak would let up<br/>for a moment!<p>His prayers were answered when Happosai once more withdrew to examine his opponent<br/>with a critical eye "Had enough, boy?"<p>"Heh... I... I'm just gettin' started..." Ranma slurred out, speech proving difficult from the<br/>many blows to the jaw he had taken. He shifted his stance to one that would allow him to<br/>put maximum power into one last all or nothing strike. He believed he'd have a good<br/>chance of hitting when Happosai next attacked, but he knew that a miss would mean the<br/>end of the fight.<p>Happosai shrugged "Your funeral." and once more attacked. As he flew towards his<br/>young foe, Ranma stumbled forward and lashed out with a haymaker in a style that was<br/>rather similar to drunken boxing - which was pretty close to the mark since Ranma was<br/>feeling pretty punch drunk at the moment.<p>Amazingly, it connected, slamming Happosai into the nearby wall with enough force to<br/>collapse the bricks on top of the geezer where he fell.<p>"Hah! How'dja like that?" Ranma crowed, spitting out some blood and noting<br/>distractedly that his vision was becoming rather blurred. "Ranma Saotome don't lose!"<p>He was naturally quite distressed at that point when Happosai pulled himself clear of the<br/>rubble and dusted himself off, seeming none the worse for wear.<p>"Well, I have to hand it to you, Ranma m'boy, you're a lot better than Genma was at your<br/>age to actually hit me. I'm almost impressed."<p>"No way..." Ranma breathed - He'd put everything into that punch and the little freak just<br/>brushes it off? What the hell was he?<p>Happosai just walked over to Ranma and looked up at him cockily "Well boy, shall we<br/>finish this or will you call me Master?"<p>Ranma grimaced - no way was he going to call this little freak Master. But there was no<br/>way to beat him. Unless... Ranma didn't like the idea that came to him then, but he was<br/>fresh out of options.<p>If he wanted to win, he'd have to use the Saotome Desperation techniques.<p>***<p>Ranko Xiawang had things better than Ranko Tendou in many ways, but at the same<br/>time she paid a higher price.<p>She could be with her mother, and even call her by that title. Even if it was as a<br/>prospective daughter in law rather than as a son. Her relationship with Nodoka was<br/>much better too, while Ranko Tendou was a loveable scamp that Nodoka liked and<br/>wanted to mold into a proper lady, Ranko Xiawang was perhaps a younger reflection of<br/>Nodoka, and it showed in just how much more affectionate the Saotome matriarch was<br/>towards her.<p>Perhaps part of it was because Ranko Xiawang was her future daughter, while Ranko<br/>Tendou was just her future daughter's backwards country cousin.<p>Ranko Tendou was a mask. A facade that was worn when necessary and then discarded<br/>for the true identity underneath. Ranko Xiawang was a real person, with a real life and<br/>future. She had friends and people who cared about her. In short, she mattered.<p>That was the trap.<p>Ranma-chan did not want to be Ranko - either Ranko. She wanted to be herself. But how<br/>can you be yourself when everything that makes you who you are gets stripped away?<br/>Ranma did exist in this world, but she was not Ranma. She was just some girl that<br/>thought of herself as him. The only way to truly become Ranma once more was by going<br/>through the role of Ranko - playing her role to its conclusion.<p>And she would do it. To become Ranma once more she would pay any price, overcome<br/>any obstacle. No matter what.<p>"No matter what." she whispered to the reflection.<p>The reflection didn't look convinced.<p>***<p>The secret of attacking from behind like a hunting canine: Fox-fu!<p>"Oh my God! What's that?" Ranma yelled, pointing at a spot in the distance behind his<br/>wily foe.<p>Happosai snorted "Yeah, as if I'll fall for that one!"<p>Okay, Saotome Desperation strike number two: Striking the enemy to the ground with a<br/>single blow, like a tiger! Feline-fu! (not to be confused with Neko-ken)<p>"Look! A hundred yen coin!" he pointed at the ground by Happosai's feet.<p>"What? Where?" Happosai instantly started scrabbling around the pavement looking for<br/>the elusive piece of currency.<p>Reacting instantly, Ranma struck with a mighty blow, driving the ancient pervert into the<br/>concrete while giving a loud yell.<p>Happosai swiftly recovered before Ranma could rain further blows on his ancient body,<br/>and now he looked really pissed. "There was no hundred yen coin! How dare you cheat<br/>an old man like that!" He summoned forth his intimidating battle aura once again,<br/>paralysing Ranma with fear.<p>However, this was just playing into Ranma's hands, and the Saotome heir dropped to the<br/>ground and started convulsing, no longer paralysed when not looking directly at<br/>Happosai. "I'm s...sorry..." he choked out.<p>"Hmm... perhaps you can learn respect after all..." Happosai nodded approvingly at this<br/>display.<p>Ultimate Saotome Desperation strike! Lulling the enemy into dropping his guard like a<br/>toad in the road! Flat Frog fu!<p>With the old letch's guard down, Ranma again lashed out with a massive blow, only to<br/>find his fist intercepted by a pipe which amplified and redirected his momentum<br/>skyward.<p>"He really is Genma's son." Happosai noted as Ranma became a distant speck in the sky.<p>***<p>Ranma-chan put down the phone, having just given Sasuke a message to Kodachi that<br/>she would be out of town for a few days, and then dialed a different number. After a few<br/>seconds it was picked up and she heard growfing noises on the other end of the line.<p>She groaned and slapped her forehead, just imagining Genma on the other end holding<br/>up a sign proclaiming that panda's can't talk. Then a human voice was heard.<p>"Honestly dear! What were you thinking?" a brief pause then "Hello, Saotome<br/>residence."<p>Forcing her voice into a cheerful tone, Ranma-chan replied to her mother "Hello mother,<br/>it's Ranko."<p>"Why hello Ranko-chan! You wouldn't know where Ranma is would you?"<p>"Well, I took him to meet a friend after school, he should be home soon." she said,<br/>twisting the cord around her fingers.<p>"I see, showing off your manly fiance, eh?" Ranma-chan could just imagine Nodoka's<br/>smirk on the other end of the line.<p>"Uh yeah... something like that. Anyway, could you tell Ranma that I won't be around<br/>for a few days, I'm going on a short training trip."<p>"Of course dear, I'll let him know. I understand it's important for you to stay in shape -<br/>besides, it'll mean you can bear lots of healthy children!" Nodoka gave a happy sigh at<br/>that.<p>Ranma-chan couldn't help but chuckle at her mother's odd views on the world "Yeah.<br/>That'd be good too... anyway, just called to let you know, I'll be back before you know<br/>it!"<p>"I should hope so, Ranko-chan. You don't want my son getting too close to Kasumi while<br/>you're gone after all. I'll see you soon."<p>"Bye... mom..." Ranma-chan whispered before hanging up.<p>Taking one last look around her apartment, she wrote a note to Happosai in case he got<br/>back while she was gone, explaining she was only gone for a few days and telling him<br/>where to find his 'collection'.<p>"I'll be back." she told the empty apartment before stepping out.<p>***
