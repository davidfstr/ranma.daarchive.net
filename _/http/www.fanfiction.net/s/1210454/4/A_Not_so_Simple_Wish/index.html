</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 10<p>"Do you have a picture of Ranma that we could look at?" Nabiki asked the large martial<br/>artist that was guzzling down sake with her father as they celebrated the imminent union<br/>of the schools.<p>"Eh?" Genma took a moment to process the question in his alcohol fogged mind. "Oh,<br/>picture. Of Ranma... sure..." he rooted through his pack and retrieved a photograph,<br/>handing it to the girls to see "It's about a year old. Ranma's a bit taller than that now..."<br/>He then went back to getting drunk with his old buddy, Soun.<p>"Hey, he is pretty handsome." Nabiki commented, maybe this engagement wouldn't be so<br/>bad after all. Provided of course that Ranko hadn't killed the poor guy or something...<p>"He's passable." Akane shrugged noncommitaly. Heck, Kuno was fairly handsome and<br/>look at him! Though in fairness, Akane doubted Ranma (or anyone) could possibly be as<br/>messed up as Nerima's favourite samurai.<p>"Oh my, Mrs Saotome must be very beautiful." Kasumi said in her usual oblivious tone,<br/>causing Nabiki to snicker loudly at the backhanded insult towards their guest. Akane just<br/>looked confused.<p>"So, how are we going to decide which of us is going to marry Ranma?" Nabiki changed<br/>the subject.<p>Akane snorted "Arranged marriages went out with the Shogunate, even if he was the<br/>greatest guy in the world I'd refuse out of principal. How about whichever of you two<br/>marries him gives the dojo to me since I'm the heir to the school?" She added the last part<br/>while making cute sparkly eyes at her two beloved big sisters.<p>Neither of them fell for it. "Fat chance Akane. If I marry him - which I haven't decided<br/>yet - I'm keeping the house." Nabiki said.<p>"Only as long as it takes to sell it." Kasumi finished for her "If anyone should inherit this<br/>place it should be me. I am the eldest after all. Provided Ranma isn't a horrible person, I'll<br/>be willing to marry him."<p>"Don't count me out yet, sis. Let's wait till he shows up before we decide, after all, doesn't<br/>Ranma have a say in this too?" Nabiki returned cooly.<p>Kasumi levelled a flat stare at Nabiki, before including Akane in her gaze "Be serious. If<br/>he has a choice between the three of us, just which one do you think he'll pick?" Kasumi<br/>made a show of looking each of her sisters over and finding them wanting.<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Akane yelled angrily.<p>Someone who didn't know the eldest Tendou daughter would swear that she smirked at<br/>that question, but of course Kasumi never smirks. No, she gave a serene smile filled with<br/>peace and familial love. "I only asked the question. You answered it, little sister."<p>"I... uh... hey!...you... er... Shut up!" Akane huffed petulantly and crossed her arms in a<br/>sulking position.<p>Nabiki just remained silent. There was no reasoning with Kasumi when she was in one of<br/>her moods, and arguing would just result in the eldest taking her frustrations out by<br/>doing things like serving smaller portions of food and putting a red sock in with the white<br/>laundry. Kasumi had a long memory for things like that.<p>***<p>Ranma was feeling rather guilty as he walked to the Tendou dojo with his mother and<br/>alleged fiancee. Nodoka was tightlipped and the perfect picture of stoic control, while<br/>Ranko looked like her world had fallen apart as she trudged along with her head down,<br/>only speaking up to give directions to Nodoka.<p>Maybe he had been a little harsh by yelling at her like that, but it was hardly his fault the<br/>poor girl was so overwhelmed by his natural studliness and couldn't handle a mild<br/>rebuking. Anyone would be surprised at finding out he had several potential fiancees! It<br/>wasn't like he meant to hurt her feelings or anything, girls were just too sensitive about<br/>stuff like that. Still, she had been really nice to him, so it wouldn't hurt to apologise or<br/>something. Besides, her sulking was starting to become irritating, she was much better<br/>company when cheerful.<p>"Hey Ranko?"<p>"Yes?" Said girl looked up to eye Ranma curiously, hiding her annoyance at being<br/>distracted from trying to come up with a plan to salvage her situation.<p>"Well... I just wanted ta..." Ranma unconsciously started fiddling with his pigtail as he<br/>fumbled for words "Y'know... er..."<p>Ranko blinked. She knew exactly what that kind of fumbling meant; he was trying to<br/>apologise to her! And she hadn't even done anything wrong really, which meant she must<br/>have made a really strong impression on him. Seeing an opportunity to score major<br/>points, she interrupted his cack handed attempt at apologising "Ranma..." she bit her lip<br/>and looked away blushing "I'm really sorry about not telling you we were engaged... I<br/>just didn't want to pressure you." She looked up at him, her eyes glistening with unshed<br/>tears (while she hated anyone seeing her crying genuinely, she had no compunction<br/>against shedding a few artful tears for the greater good) "Can you forgive me?"<p>Phew, saved! Thought Ranma cheerfuly "Aw, t'weren't nothin' Ranko, I don't mind." He<br/>smiled down at her.<p>Sniff "I'm glad." Ranko gave Ranma a happy smile and walked on with her head held<br/>high.<p>Ahead of the two, Nodoka grinned widely to herself. Those two would be married in no<br/>time at this rate, and then she'd have lots and lots of grandchildren to fuss over. She'd<br/>been without a family for too long, but now things were looking up for the Saotome<br/>matriarch.<p>***<p>"Maybe that's Ranma?" Nabiki asked her sisters as there was a knock at the front door.<p>"Yesshh, I knew dat boy'd know whash gud for 'im and come 'ere to marry Soun's<br/>daughtersh... Ain't that right Tendou?" Genma drunkenly clapped a hand on his friends<br/>shoulder as he tried to recall if he had actually given the Tendou's address to Ranma.<p>"Now the schools will be joined! Go and marry him girls, make daddy proud!" Soun<br/>waved victory fans as he encouraged his daughters, likewise drunkenly, albeit slightly<br/>less so than Genma.<p>Kasumi shook her head at their antics as she went to answer the door, "Welcome to the<br/>Tendou dojo." she greeted the trio, recognising Ranko from last month as well as Ranma<br/>from the picture Genma had shown them. The older woman was a mystery to her though.<p>Nodoka bowed "Hello, I am Nodoka Saotome. Is my husband Genma here?"<p>"Oh, you're Saotome-san's wife? Come in, come in." Kasumi ushered them in, looking<br/>forward to the fireworks when Nodoka saw her husband was drunk as a skunk. The fact<br/>that the dojo destroyer girl from last month was here also promised an interesting<br/>evening.<p>Nodoka spotted Genma as soon as they entered the foyer "Husband, what's this I hear<br/>about you arranging a marriage for Ranma?"<p>Genma blinked owlishly at his wife "No-chan? The boysh gotta marry Tendou's<br/>daughters to carry on the schoolsh... an' that'll prove he'sh manly so you don' haveta kill<br/>us!"<p>Ranko and Nodoka groaned while everyone else blinked at Genma's statement. "That's<br/>hardly an issue, dearest." Nodoka said in a measured tone "Now will someone explain to<br/>me what this arrangement with the Tendou's is about? I had already made arrangements<br/>for Ranma to marry Ranko-chan here." She indicated the redhead who grinned cockily at<br/>the Tendous.<p>This threat to the joining of the schools finally roused Soun, who had fallen into an<br/>alcohol induced slumber "Ranma will marry one of my daughters!" The Tendou<br/>patriarch roared, his head expanding to several times it's normal size while flames burned<br/>in his eyes and his tongue lolled out several feet. Then he spotted Ranko discretely<br/>holding what looked like a small spherical firecracker and smiling at him in a most<br/>unnerving manner, causing him to go "Eeeep!" and hide behind Kasumi.<p>Everyone looked around to see what had upset Soun so much, but Ranko had already<br/>hidden the Happodaikarin and looked far too cute and innocent to be viewed with<br/>suspicion by any right thinking individual.<p>"What did you do to my dad?" Akane yelled furiously, pointing at Ranko.<p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Ranko sniffed haughtily, "He's probably just<br/>seeing things from being so drunk. Honestly, who'd want anything to do with an<br/>alcoholic like that."<p>Soun started sobbing pathetically "Don't be so cruel! I drink to forget the pain!" he<br/>dissolved into wretched sniffles.<p>Kasumi heaved a put upon sigh "Akane, would you take father to bed. Maybe then we<br/>can discuss this like adults?"<p>Akane nodded as she hefted her father up by the shoulders and dragged him to his room.<br/>"You still love daddy, don't you Akane?" He asked as he was put to bed.<p>"Sure, whatever..." Akane said, not really paying attention as she returned to the foyer,<br/>ignoring the fresh bout of wailing that came from Soun's room. Once she was back in the<br/>room, introductions were made between the Tendous and Nodoka.<p>"Okay then, now Genma... huh? Where'd Genma go?" Nodoka looked around,<br/>wondering where her husband had vanished off to.<p>Everyone else just stared at the large indiginous Chinese mammal which was playing<br/>with a tire and holding a sign saying [I'm just a cute panda!] Genma having lost his<br/>courage after Soun was taken out of the discussion.<p>"Pop, you sure are pathetic." Ranma grumbled as he kicked his ursine father and<br/>splashed a handy cup of still warm tea on the panda.<p>Nodoka then did what the Tendous had done earlier and fainted.<p>Ranko just stood there until she noticed Ranma and the Tendou sisters were staring at<br/>her expectantly. "Oh my god! That panda turned into a man, I have never seen such a<br/>thing!" She cried out in mock shock. Everyone then nodded, seemingly satisfied with her<br/>reaction.<p>Since everyone was just standing around awkwardly, Ranko took it upon herself to tap a<br/>few pressure points on Nodoka to revive her.<p>"Oh, I could have sworn I saw a panda turn into my husband..." Nodoka muttered as she<br/>got up.<p>Ahem "Yes well..." Genma made use of a little known martial arts trick to sober up<br/>quickly - after all, his cushy retirement at the Tendou dojo was being threatened! "Soun<br/>and I decided that the two schools of anything goes martial arts would be joined by the<br/>marriage of Ranma to one of his daughters." He put on his best stern face "It is a matter<br/>of honour!"<p>"Well why didn't you ever tell me, dearest? I'd already made arrangements for Ranma to<br/>marry Ranko-chan." Nodoka sighed and tried to work out a crink in her neck from when<br/>she fainted "Can I see the contract of betrothal you made with Soun?"<p>Genma looked thoughtful for a moment before saying "I don't have one, it's a verbal<br/>agreement. But Ranma must marry a Tendou!"<p>"But I've already signed a contract of bethrothal with Ranko!" Nodoka fretted, wringing<br/>her hands in frustration.<p>"We went to the temple so it was signed on holy ground." Ranko piped up helpfuly,<br/>earning a glare from Genma, which she returned with equal force.<p>"Well, who do you want to marry, Ranma?" Nodoka turned to her son, who started at<br/>finally being included in the conversation.<p>"I dunno, I just met all these girls! I'm too young ta get married anyway!"<p>"Right, and which of you girls wants to marry my son?" Nodoka looked at the four<br/>young ladies in attendance, completely dismissing Ranma's concerns about getting<br/>married too early.<p>The three Tendou sisters formed a huddle to discuss this amongst themselves. Akane was<br/>still adamantly against the whole thing, while Nabiki had decided to waive her claim<br/>since she didn't want to get on Ranko's bad side. After a moment, Kasumi stepped<br/>forward and said "I would be willing to marry Ranma-kun to meet the demands of<br/>honour for my family."<p>Nodoka smiled. Kasumi seemed like a very nice girl, though she still hoped things would<br/>work out between her son and Ranko-chan. "And you aren't going to give up are you,<br/>Ranko-chan?" She asked the redhead.<p>"I don't want to force Ranma into anything," Ranko said, now knowing better than to<br/>push things too fast "but I think I'd like to marry him if he'll have me..." she looked down<br/>shyly and traced patterns on the floor with her foot.<p>Nodoka clapped joyfully "Then it's settled. Ranma, you may date them both!"<p>***<p>Chapter 11<p>Ranma sputtered incoherently at his mother's declaration for a moment before he found<br/>his voice "You want me to two time them?" Sure, he knew he was practically the<br/>epitome of manliness, but he'd never actually had a girlfriend before! Now his mother<br/>tells him to two time his alleged fiancees?<p>Nodoka noticed both Kasumi and Ranko were looking rather miffed (although Ranko's<br/>expression seemed a lot more accepting, as if it was just one of those distasteful things<br/>that she had gotten used to) and realised her words hadn't been especially well chosen.<br/>"No, no, I didn't mean it like that!" she waved her hands in a placating gesture "I just<br/>thought that since you need to get to know them both before making a decision, dating<br/>them seems the best way to do that, right?"<p>"But Ranma shouldn't be dating that girl at all!" Genma pointed accusingly at Ranko,<br/>who scowled back "Ranma has to marry one of Soun's daughters to carry on the dojo!"<br/>And provide for me in my cushy retirement, although that thought was left unspoken.<p>"Why the hell would I want to carry on this worthless dojo anyway? They lost their sign<br/>to a girl!" Ranma indicated Ranko, who was torn between puffing up at her triumph, or<br/>getting upset at Ranma's casual dismissal of her skills.<p>"Hey!" Yelled all three Tendous, taking exception to Ranma's description of their dojo as<br/>'worthless'.<p>All colour drained from Genma's face "What?" he asked hoarsely, visions of his peaceful<br/>life of drinking beer and playing shogi with Soun while Ranma ran a successful dojo and<br/>provided to his every need evaporated before him. Still, Genma is nothing if not good at<br/>coming up with hare-brained plans. "Boy!" he pointed at his son, mustering up every<br/>once of paternal presence he could "For the honour of the Anything Goes school of<br/>martial arts, you must defeat that girl and recover the dojo sign!"<p>"Why the hell should I old man?" Ranma yelled right back "I ain't no Tendou, if they<br/>can't protect their sign, they don't deserve it!"<p>Ranko gave a silent cheer to Ranma showing some backbone, sparing a moment to regret<br/>she hadn't done the same during that whole mess with the instant nannichuan and the<br/>dojo destroyer.<p>"Dearest!" Nodoka cut in, sounding mortified "How can you even ask Ranma to attack<br/>his fiancee?"<p>"Yeah, besides, she practices Anything Goes too, so it would hardly be 'for the honour of<br/>the school' if I were to beat her." Ranma added, nodding at his own wisdom.<p>Ranko frowned slightly, but was able to force down the urge to disabuse him of the<br/>notion that he would automatically win any fight between them, since that would only be<br/>counterproductive. It was still getting pretty annoying though.<p>"What?" Genma peered at Ranko through his glasses "Who taught you, girl?" he asked<br/>gruffly.<p>Ranko rolled back on her heels and adopted her most disgustingly cute 'golly mister,<br/>won't you give me an extra scoop of icecream, please?' expression as she smiled<br/>guilelessly at Genma "Grampa." she said simply.<p>"Your grandfather?" Genma furrowed his brow in puzzlement, wondering who on earth<br/>she could be referring to.<p>"Uh huh." Ranko nodded cheerfuly "He's not really my grandfather, but I call him that<br/>since he's just like one. His name's Happosai..." Genma blanched severely and started<br/>making strangled choking noises, but Ranko continued prattling on as if she didn't notice<br/>"He's so nice, and he just completely adores me! Why I bet he'd do anything for me if I<br/>asked!"<p>Nodoka looked at Ranko in surprise "You know Happosai-sensei? But Dearest told me<br/>he died just before he left with Ranma."<p>Ranko looked askance at Nodoka; there almost seemed to be some affection in her tone<br/>when referring to the old letch. That was certainly unexpected "Yes, he disappeared just<br/>after he started training me when I was little, but he came back fairly recently. He's out<br/>of town now, but should be back in a few days."<p>"Wish he'd never come back. Tiny perverted bastard..." Nabiki grumbled quietly, still<br/>bitter over her first meeting with the diminiutive grandmaster of Anything Goes.<p>"Boy!" Genma grabbed Ranma and started shaking him roughly, having regained a<br/>modicum of courage upon hearing the Master was not in the immediate vicinity "You<br/>have to marry Kasumi before the Master comes back! Do it for your old man! Take one<br/>for the team, come on boy!" he pleaded desperately.<p>"Don't I feel special." Kasumi muttered bitterly, causing Akane to give her big sister a<br/>concerned glance before marching up and grabbing Ranma.<p>"Hey, don't you know how lucky you are that Kasumi is agreeing to this engagement?<br/>Are you trying to say my big sister isn't good enough for you or something?" She yelled<br/>angrily.<p>Ranma was looking decidedly nonplussed at being shaken around by both his father and<br/>this angry girl "I didn't ask for no fiancees dammit!" He yelled, working free of their<br/>respective grasps "Mom, can we go home now? I don't wanna deal with this crap right<br/>now."<p>Nodoka sighed. Her son was being annoyingly stubborn, but it was clear nothing was<br/>going to get resolved tonight. "Very well, let's go. I'll be by for a chat tomorrow Kasumi-<br/>chan, is that alright?" she smiled at the eldest Tendou daughter.<p>Kasumi nodded "Why don't you come round at lunchtime?"<p>"That sounds lovely, Kasumi-chan, I look forward to getting to know you better."<br/>Nodoka said as she started to leave with Ranma before turning round "Aren't you<br/>coming, Dearest?"<p>"Huh? But I was going to stay here..." Genma muttered petulantly.<p>Nodoka frowned "You can visit Soun whenever you like, but you are supposed to live<br/>with me. Besides, now that your training journey is over you can get a job, it'll be nice to<br/>have a decent income coming into the house."<p>Genma looked close to tears, but obediently followed his wife and child like a whipped<br/>puppy.<p>"And take your floozy with you!" Akane called out to Ranma as she started pushing<br/>Ranko towards the door.<p>"Hey! I resemble that remark!" Ranko protested as she allowed herself to be ushered out.<p>***<p>"...and now it turns out he's engaged to Kasumi!" Ranko related her tale of the previous<br/>evening to Kodachi as the two drank tea in a small cafe near Ranko's apartment "I mean,<br/>Akane I could handle, she's just an uncute tomboy..." Ranko was convieniently forgetting<br/>the fact that she had a soft spot for Akane in her old life, but her Akane was way different<br/>than this one anyway. I mean, she had short hair! "And Nabiki... well, she's pretty much<br/>a bitch. But Kasumi? How the hell am I gonna compete with her?"<p>Kodachi smirked at her friend getting so worked up, it was really quite funny to see her<br/>like this "Come now, don't sell yourself short. Any man would be lucky to have you." she<br/>offered consolingly.<p>Ranko slumped in her seat "I dunno, 'Dachi... I mean, yeah we got off to a pretty good<br/>start and all, but it's Kasumi! She's like... I dunno, the nicest girl in the world or<br/>something."<p>"Niceness is highly overrated." Kodachi remarked drolly.<p>"Heh, shoulda figured you'd say somethin' like that." Ranko grinned, starting to lift her<br/>spirits. After all, it was true that there had never been any sexual chemistry between<br/>herself and Kasumi back when she had been Ranma.<p>"So, when am I going to meet this mysterious fiance of yours?" Kodachi asked while<br/>indicating to the nearby waitress that she wanted a refill.<p>Ranko shrugged "He's supposed to be starting at Furinkan tomorrow. I'll bring him by<br/>here after school. Just remember," she waggled her forefinger at Kodachi in a mock<br/>reproving manner "he's my fiance and I've already got enough competition. Don't you be<br/>getting any ideas about going after him."<p>Kodachi pouted "Oh poo, you're no fun at all."<p>***<p>Ranma was just leaving for school the next day, grumbling about having to wear a<br/>uniform, when he spotted Kasumi standing outside his front gate. "Hey Kasumi, what are<br/>you doin' here?" He greeted her as he walked over.<p>Kasumi smiled at him "Good morning Ranma-kun. As to why I am here..." she gave a<br/>small sigh "Father felt it would be best if I were to walk my fiance to school."<p>Ranma, despite being rather dense and unobservant around women, still noticed Kasumi<br/>seemed less than thrilled to be here. "We didn't really get much chance to talk the other<br/>day, but I take it you're not too happy about this arranged marriage stuff?" he asked as<br/>they started walking towards Furinkan.<p>"Well... it is a matter of honour, and neither of my sisters were willing..." Kasumi said<br/>hesitantly.<p>Ranma nodded "I get it, so they just dumped it on you, huh?" he asked, hiding his<br/>annoyance that the other two Tendous thought he wasn't good enough for them.<p>"Oh no, it's not really like that!" Kasumi protested "I mean, I don't mind... and it's not<br/>that Akane and Nabiki dislike you, Akane just has an objection towards anyone trying to<br/>dictate her life, and Nabiki didn't want to get involved because of Ranko-chan."<p>Ranma eyed her suspiciously "And you don't mind your fiance already bein' engaged to<br/>some other girl?"<p>Kasumi looked away "I'd be lying if I said that this is how I imagined my engagement to<br/>turn out... still, perhaps your mother was right when she said we should just get to know<br/>one another and see how things turn out, without having to worry about who has the<br/>more valid claim."<p>"I guess so... I don't really want ta get married just yet, but I wouldn't mind having a<br/>girfriend. I just don't wanna lead anyone on though..."<p>"Well, just don't take too long in deciding then." Kasumi advised him before noticing<br/>they were just coming up on her old high school "Here we are, Ranma-kun. I made you a<br/>bento." she took a lunchbox from her handbag and gave it to Ranma.<p>"Thanks Kasumi!" Ranma gleefuly accepted the proffered food "Mom already made me<br/>a lunch, but I'm a big eater."<p>"Just don't eat too much, I wouldn't want you to wind up like your father." Kasumi<br/>giggled as she poked him in the ribs.<p>"Pop ain't fat, he's just big boned..." Ranma trailed off on noticing Kasumi's sceptical<br/>expression "Aw heck, I don't believe it either, but it's what he always says."<p>Kasumi smiled, Ranma might be a little rough around the edges, but he was pretty good<br/>company. "Have a nice day at school, Ranma-kun."<p>"Thanks Kasumi, I will. See ya later." He called to her retreating back. He then passed<br/>the gates of Furinkan High. He had the feeling today was going to be a good day.<p>***<p>OMAKE THEATRE<br/>(just this once, I couldn't resist)<p>Ranma sputtered incoherently at his mother's declaration for a moment before he found<br/>his voice "You want me to two time them?" Sure, he knew he was practically the<br/>epitome of manliness, but he'd never actually had a girlfriend before! Now his mother<br/>tells him to two time his prospective fiancees?<p>Nodoka snorted in a nonetheless ladylike manner "Hmph, don't be so vulgar. Kasumi, so<br/>pure, so tidy. Ranko, bursting with healthy beauty. Both so dear, I can give up neither.<br/>Do you call it deceit to openly wish them both?"<p>Ranma considered this for a moment before grinning "Heck no! I call it my just reward!<br/>Come on girls, let's find somewhere private before we get to know each other better..."<p>Kasumi blushed, but her usual smile had aquired a decidedly lecherous quality "Oh my,<br/>Ranma-kun! It's a good thing you have enough energy for us both. That's what I love<br/>about you younger men..."<p>Ranko watched Ranma and Kasumi head off to the bedroom in shocked amazement<br/>before shrugging. "Hell, I always was a bit of a narcissist anyway. Ranma! Wait for<br/>me!" she called out while rushing after them, disrobing as she went.<p>***
