</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 21<p>"This looks like a good spot to set camp." Ranko turned to her companions as they<br/>entered a cosy little clearing in the forest.<p>Ranma looked around and nodded silently, while the third member of their party spoke<br/>up<p>"Oh yes, this is a lovely spot!" Kasumi agreed, twirling around to take in the view before<br/>dropping her backpack and sitting on a large rock. A small chipmunk descended from<br/>the branches to alight on her outstretched hand in a sickeningly cute display as a<br/>sunbeam seemed to penetrate the canopy just to illuminate her with it's heavenly<br/>radiance.<p>After shaking herself out of admiring the eldest Tendou sister, Ranko grimaced. She had<br/>chosen not to protest when Soun and Genma had insisted that Kasumi accompany<br/>Ranma and her on their training trip, but now she was starting to have second thoughts.<p>While she wasn't tired in the least from their hike up the mountain, Ranko was still rather<br/>dirty and smelly, she and Ranma both wearing their martial arts dogi, which looked to<br/>have seen better days. Kasumi, on the other hand, looked as fresh and pristine as she had<br/>upon leaving the train station, dressed in khaki shorts and vest, set off with a wide<br/>brimmed floppy hat and looking all for the world as if she were simply enjoying a<br/>pleasant stroll in the park.<p>"It's been such a long time since I went camping. I was actually surprised when father<br/>said I could come along with you." Kasumi surprised Ranko by favouring both her and<br/>Ranma with a warm smile.<p>"Huh? He seemed pretty gung ho about the idea ta me," Ranma replied.<p>"Yes, it was rather odd, since he wouldn't even let me go on the school camping trip<br/>when I was at Furinkan."<p>"Why not?" Ranko asked, being drawn into the discussion.<p>Kasumi sighed wistfully. "Well, we used to go camping as a family quite often when I<br/>was younger... it was always so much fun to sleep under the stars, even if Nabiki never<br/>stopped complaining about the bugs trying to eat her or how she missed her cartoons... I<br/>always thought it was a wonderful experience to be so close to nature, even if just for a<br/>few days." Kasumi frowned slightly and her expression became pensive. "I think I was<br/>seven when we went on our last camping trip. We were near the Higo forest in an area<br/>called... um... something-zawa..."<p>"Ryuugenzawa," Ranko put in, having figured out where this story was going.<p>"Yes, that's it." Kasumi nodded gratefully. "Have you been there?" Ranko nodded, but<br/>chose not to elaborate, instead prompting Kasumi to continue her story. "Anyway, it was<br/>a long time ago, but I recall Akane managed to get herself lost in the forest. She did come<br/>out unharmed, but after that, father decided that camping was too dangerous for us. Such<br/>a pity, I really loved camping, but father always was prone to overreact to little things..."<p>"Yeah, your old man is a bit high strung," Ranma said before giving Kasumi a nervous<br/>look and adding, "uh... no offence."<p>Kasumi smiled beatifically. "None taken, Ranma-kun."<p>"Anyway," Ranko said in an attempt to change the subject, "I guess we should put up our<br/>tents. Sleeping under the stars is nice, but with all these clouds I think it'll rain tonight.<br/>We'll probably have enough light to set up camp; we can start your training tomorrow,<br/>Ranma."<p>All three teenagers went into their backpacks and started retrieving camping supplies,<br/>only to stop when Kasumi gave a small gasp of alarm.<p>"What is it?" Ranma went over to see what was wrong.<p>"Someone has cut up my tent!"<p>***<p>"Boy, it sure was a good idea to make Kasumi go along on that training trip before the<br/>other girl could get her claws into Ranma, eh Tendou-kun?"<p>"I don't know, Saotome-kun. It seems like Ranko and Ranma will spend all their time<br/>training together and leave my poor baby all by herself!"<p>"Not to worry, old friend, I've taken care of it! Even if my ungrateful boy and that too-<br/>cunning-for-my-own-good girl spend time training in the day, Kasumi will have Ranma<br/>all to herself in the night. I've seen to that."<p>"How so?"<p>"Well, when they discover that Kasumi's tent has suffered an unforunate accident, my<br/>boy will volunteer to let her share his. And then nature will take its course."<p>"Oh, my darling Kasumi will finally become a woman! We can hold the wedding when<br/>they get back! You're a genius, Saotome-kun!"<p>"Quite so, Tendou-kun, quite so. Oh, I believe it's your round?"<p>***<p>Ranko observed the jagged rows of cuts down the fabric of Kasumi's tent. Carefully<br/>examining the rips, she saw all the evidence that was needed. "Panda fur," she<br/>pronounced as her judgement.<p>"You mean Pop did this?" Ranma demanded angrily. "What the hell for?"<p>Ranko looked between Ranma and Kasumi with a half hidden smirk. "Gee, I wonder.<br/>Anyway, Kasumi, you can have my tent and I'll just sleep out here tonight."<p>"You can't sleep outside! Kasumi can have my tent and I'll sleep outside!" Ranma put in<br/>quickly, after all, it was the man's place to make such sacrifices.<p>"Oh, there's no need for any of that, you two," Kasumi remonstrated them gently.<br/>"Ranko's tent looks easily large enough for us both to share. No one has to sleep outside<br/>tonight, and it'll be like a slumber party for us girls!"<p>Ranma nodded, seeing nothing wrong in the two girls sleeping in the same tent, but<br/>Ranko jolted as if she had been hit with a cattle prod. "Sh-share? Uh, no! Really!" she<br/>started waving her hands franticly in a negative gesture. "It's fine, really! I've slept<br/>outside in far worse conditions than this, so don't worry about it!" Intellectually, she<br/>knew there was no chance of anything untoward happening between herself and Kasumi,<br/>but somehow this situation seemed like it was teetering over the precipice of a slippery<br/>slope to disaster. Heck, most of the time nothing untoward ever happened with her and<br/>any other girl, but that didn't stop everyone from drawing the worst possible conclusions.<p>"Well if you sleep outside then so will I," Kasumi declared with an air of finality that she<br/>had used to end more than one sibling squabble involving Akane and Nabiki.<p>With a heavy sinking feeling in her heart, Ranko agreed.<p>***<p>"Oh crap! That's too much salt!" Nabiki groaned at the large pile of white salt crystals<br/>that were slowly dissolving in her simmering stew. She had begged Kasumi not to leave,<br/>but it was to no avail, and so the middle Tendou was stuck doing the cooking for her<br/>remaining family.<p>It could have been worse. Nabiki had fully expected Akane to volunteer for cooking<br/>duties, but her little sister was acting rather moody today and chose not to share her<br/>culinary skills with everyone else. Soun had fully expected Akane to cook and had made<br/>himself scarce right after Kasumi left the house, leaving just the two youngest daughters<br/>in residence.<p>Scooping up as much of the salt as she could before it dissolved, Nabiki emptied it in the<br/>sink before pouring a little water in the pot, hoping it would weaken the salty taste, but<br/>forgetting it would also weaken the taste of everything else in the stew.<p>Nabiki considered adding some pepper at this point, but decided that she was starting to<br/>fall into Akane's pattern of relentlessly spicing up simple recipes; and if she started that,<br/>she would soon be adding soap crystals and rat poison. Giving the pot one last vigorous<br/>stir, she took it through to the family room and set it on the table. "Dinner is served."<p>Akane scooped some onto her plate in a painfully lethargic manner, and started eating,<br/>chewing with interminable slowness. After eventually swallowing, she pronounced<br/>judgement. "I miss Kasumi."<p>"You and me both. What are we gonna do when she moves out for real?" Nabiki asked<br/>miserably.<p>"We could be her pathetic mooching sisters who visit every day at dinnertime to<br/>scrounge up a free meal?" Akane offered.<p>Nabiki sighed. "Sounds like a plan."<p>The pair ate in silence for several moments before Nabiki spoke up in a conversational<br/>tone. "I heard you dropped by Dr. Tofu's today. You don't look hurt..."<p>Alane's chopsticks snapped in her suddenly much tighter grip. "Don't talk to me about<br/>that... that idiot!"<p>"Ah, so my little sister has been disillusioned over her first crush. How's it feel?" Nabiki<br/>smirked cruelly, thinking it was far before time that Akane gave up on the good doctor.<p>Akane growled angrily. "I can't believe I used to respect him. He's just as stupid as those<br/>boys at school. In fact, that's an insult to boys everywhere!" Akane's voice was starting to<br/>rise sharply. "He's the most moronic imbecile to ever walk the earth!"<p>Nabiki chuckled at Akane's theatrics. "Come on, what happened? Tell big sis all about<br/>it," she cajoled.<p>"He just refuses to accept reality. I've told him about Kasumi's engagement hundreds of<br/>times, but he always just goes a little nuts and then acts like he never heard anything. I've<br/>tried writing notes, but he always shreds them into little bits then pretends he never read<br/>them. At least I hope he's pretending; I'd hate to think my doctor was that delusional."<br/>She wrung her hands in exasparation. "I just can't deal with his nonsense anymore."<p>Nabiki quirked an eyebrow at that. She hadn't visited Tofu's clinic in a while, but she<br/>thought he at least knew Kasumi was now off the market. "Oh well, now that you've seen<br/>there's no such thing as the perfect man, maybe you'll relax your standards a bit? Plenty<br/>more fish in the sea, as they say."<p>"Name one," Akane challenged flatly.<p>"Er..." Nabiki floundered at that one. There was a shortage of decent guys in Nerima, it<br/>seemed. "Um... I guess Ranma isn't that bad, in a kinda clueless way..."<p>Akane stared at Nabiki incredulously. "He's a two timing jerk and is engaged to our<br/>sister. Any other great recommendations? Perhaps someone who is better than 'not bad in<br/>a kinda clueless way'?"<p>"Uh... there's a lot more to the world than Nerima, I'm sure you'll find someone. Heh..."<p>Akane didn't look convinced.<p>***<p>Ranko tried to keep from blushing at the close proximity she was in with Kasumi. Even<br/>though they both had their separate sleeping bags, their faces were barely more than a<br/>foot apart as they lay in her tent.<p>"So what will you and Ranma be doing tomorrow to train?" Kasumi asked.<p>"Well, I'll have Ranma stand under a hornet's nest while I chuck rocks at it. Dodging<br/>them will improve his speed a lot."<p>Kasumi opened her mouth in a little 'o' and stared at Ranko for a minute before speaking.<br/>"Isn't that a little... harsh?"<p>Ranko waved off her concerns. "If I could do it, so can he."<p>"If you're sure..." Kasumi replied dubiously.<p>The pair lay in silence for a few more minutes as Ranko brooded. She hadn't thought<br/>Kasumi was any serious competition, really, but seeing the way Ranma and the eldest<br/>Tendou sister interacted, it was obvious that they had far more chemistry than she had<br/>ever had with her own Kasumi.<p>It was strange, really, to see Kasumi was so much more lively and... happy than she<br/>remembered. Kasumi had never seemed depressed, but the difference was plain to see. If<br/>it wasn't for Ranko, would Kasumi and Ranma already be on their way to getting<br/>married? Or if she hadn't been cursed, would she have been married to Kasumi?<p>It was starting to make her head hurt. She had never expected it would be so hard to<br/>make Ranma fall in love with her. Everyone else seemed to fall in love at the drop of a<br/>hat. Kodachi, Kuno, Ryouga, Shampoo, Ukyo... all of them fell in love almost instantly.<br/>It seemed everyone she knew was like that... at least, everyone except from Akane.<p>She was really starting to miss that uncute tomboy. She hadn't really cared about the<br/>harm she was doing to the Akane in this world, but with no end to this trial in sight, she<br/>had felt compelled to try and mend fences with this Akane, even if she would never be<br/>anything like Ranko's own fiancee Akane.<p>It was probably a mistake. Yet another chain holding her to this identity as 'Ranko<br/>Xiawang' which would make it harder to leave this life behind. If she ever did at the rate<br/>it was taking for Ranma to fall in love with her...<p>"Ranko, are you still awake?"<p>"Yes, what is it?" Ranko propped her head up a bit to look at her companion.<p>"Well, I was just thinking... are we friends?" Kasumi's voice sounded surprisingly<br/>hesitant.<p>Ranko blinked. "What kinda question is that?" she asked in surprise.<p>Kasumi bunched up the lip of her sleeping bag in her hands. "Well, we are rivals for the<br/>same man, and normally that makes people enemies... but I think you're a nice person,<br/>and we don't seem to be fighting like enemies should..."<p>Ranko averted her eyes. She wasn't a nice person. She'd done a lot of things she was<br/>ashamed of in her life, and this mission to manipulate Ranma into loving her was<br/>probably one of the worst. She was resolute in doing it, but it felt less and less good with<br/>each passing day. Being called 'nice' by Kasumi only made her feel even lower. "I'd like<br/>it if we were friends, Kasumi," she said at length.<p>Kasumi sighed in relief. "I'm glad to hear that. I've never had a real enemy before, I<br/>wouldn't know what to do," she said before giving a small giggle.<p>Ranko managed a wan smile. It was odd, but she couldn't recall ever hearing Kasumi<br/>laugh like that. She had a nice laugh, and Ranko found herself wishing she could hear it<br/>more often. Feeling some of the tension dissipate, Ranko decided to try and find out the<br/>answer to something she had been wondering about for a while. "Kasumi, what made<br/>you decide to accept the engagement with Ranma?"<p>The other girl chewed her lip and looked thoughtful for a second before answering.<br/>"Well, one of us had to accept it, but I suppose that isn't much of an answer. I could have<br/>easily refused and put the engagement onto one of my sisters and no one would have<br/>thought less of me. I suppose the main reason is that I'm lonely; I haven't had a date since<br/>junior high, and those were all disasters."<p>"So you didn't really care what he was like?" Ranko asked, her voice was slightly<br/>strained, but only someone who knew her well would have noticed.<p>"Not exactly. I didn't really have time to find out much about him before I accepted,<br/>remember. Still, from my first impression he seemed nice enough, maybe a little rough<br/>around the edges, but that's hardly a glaring flaw. I suppose if he'd been some sort of<br/>freak or something I would have dumped him off on Akane. It would have been funny to<br/>see her try to deal with an arranged marriage, especially to someone she couldn't stand."<br/>Kasumi giggled again and gave Ranko a mischievous little smile, as if she was feeling<br/>rather naughty at sharing that with her new friend.<p>Ranko suddenly wished she hadn't asked. She had always known Kasumi and Nabiki<br/>had passed her off onto Akane because she was a worthless transgender freak, but<br/>somehow that knowledge didn't compare with actually hearing the confirmation from<br/>Kasumi herself that was like a crushing blow. She felt hot salty tears starting to collect on<br/>her eyes, and desperately tried to blink them away. When that failed, she rolled over to<br/>face away from Kasumi so she wouldn't see her shameful crying.<p>She was a horrible, manipulative person, and even sweet, gentle Kasumi thought she was<br/>a freak.<p>Kasumi stared at the cascading waves of red hair which now occupied her vision instead<br/>of the cute and expressive face of the younger girl she had been talking to. "Ranko, are<br/>you alright?" she asked worriedly.<p>"I'm just tired. I'm going to sleep," came the choked reply.<p>Kasumi didn't buy it, but had no idea what she had said that had upset Ranko so much,<br/>so instead she simply lay there, wondering what had went wrong while Ranko feigned<br/>sleep and struggled to deal with her ever-growing self-loathing.<p>It was a long time before either of them went to sleep that night.<p>***
