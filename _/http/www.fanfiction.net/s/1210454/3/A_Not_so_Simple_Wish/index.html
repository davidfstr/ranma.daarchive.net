</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 8<p>Ranko sipped at her lukewarm tea with a distasteful frown. It was raining rather heavily<br/>and she had been sitting at this kissaten for the better part of the afternoon. It had seemed<br/>like a good idea, today was the day she had arrived in Nerima what was literally a<br/>lifetime ago, so she had decided to stakeout the route she and pop had taken. But there<br/>was no sign of Ranma or Genma.<p>That worried her. Though intellectually she knew the lack of a curse would change<br/>things - she had made a few detours to various training grounds in order to adjust to the<br/>new body, not to mention going off in random directions for a few days at a time to try<br/>and lose a certain homocidal amazon. Thinking things over, she decided that should<br/>mean Ranma would arrive early, yet she had heard nothing from Nabiki, so what could<br/>be delaying them?<p>Sighing, she drained the last of her tea and ordered a fresh cup. I'll wait until it gets dark,<br/>she thought.<p>***<p>Several hours ago...<p>"Ah, it's nice to be back in Japan again, right Pop?" A handsome young man with his<br/>hair in a pigtail and dressed in a dirty white gi addressed his companion after they<br/>stepped onto the docks from the cargo freighter they had stowed away on.<p>[You said it boy.] A large shifty eyed panda produced a wooden sign from nowhere with<br/>it's message written in sloppy hiragana.<p>"So, what are we gonna do now? Be nice ta settle down in one place for a while..." the<br/>boy trailed off wistfuly.<p>[We're going to visit an old friend of mine.] quoth the panda.<p>The boy snorted disdainfuly at this "You've got a friend, Pop? I find that hard ta believe."<p>***<p>A while later, on the outskirts of Nerima, Ranma was feeling much less charitably<br/>disposed towards his father. "Picking me fiance for me..." he interrupted the panda's<br/>flurry of punches by grabbing a meaty paw "Without even asking!" he cried while<br/>tossing Genma over his shoulder. "Screw you old man. I'm outta here." Ranma turned his<br/>back on the downed panda and hefted his backpack. He didn't know where he would go,<br/>but he sure as hell wanted nothing to do with his father right now.<p>Genma smirked in his own inimitable panda fashion as he uprooted a street sign and<br/>prepared to brain his unsuspecting son. The boy was far too cocky for his own good. He<br/>was unfortunately unprepared for the small redhead who suddenly came flying out of the<br/>nearby kissaten and floored him with a spinning roundhouse kick.<p>"What the...?" Ranma turned just in time to see the sign wielding panda hit the deck,<br/>and then watched in amazement as the petite girl proceeded to viciously kick his father<br/>about the ribs and stomach several times. "Uh... I think he's down..." he commented<br/>inanely.<p>"Heh, Panda's can be tricky." The girl smirked before popping open an umbrella and<br/>holding it above both of them. "He was about to attack you from behind."<p>Wow... she's really cute... Ranma thought as he took in her appearance. She was rather<br/>short, but exceptionally well formed, with a grace and tone that suggested rigourous<br/>training. She wore a knee length black skirt with a thigh slit that showed off quite a bit of<br/>leg, and a wooly green sweater which offset her beautiful wavy red hair. After taking all<br/>this in, Ranma's brain caught up with what she said and he responded in the only way he<br/>knew how. "Feh, I woulda dodged it easy."<p>For some reason the girl's previously easygoing smile suddenly became a whole lot more<br/>strained at that comment. Not that Ranma noticed of course...<p>***<p>"Feh, I woulda dodged it easy."<p>That arrogant bastard! Ranko thought furiously, taking his remark as a personal insult<br/>since *she* hadn't been able to dodge that exact same blow in her old life. Before she<br/>could formulate a suitably insulting reply, Genma proved he wasn't a master of Anything<br/>Goes martial arts for nothing, as he rose once more and smacked both teenagers with the<br/>street sign.<p>Ranma was instantly rendered unconscious, and Genma caught him before he hit the<br/>ground then started hightailing it towards his old buddy Soun's house.<p>Ranko on the other hand had grown a LOT more resistant to blunt trauma since arriving<br/>in Nerima, and barely stumbled before recovering swiftly. "Not this time, Pop." She<br/>whispered as the familiar yellow aura of confidence formed around her body "Mouko<br/>Takabisha!" The intense blast of ki rocketed from her outstretched hands and slammed<br/>into the fleeing panda with the force of a freight train.<p>Quickly walking over to the downed father and son pair, she inspected the singed Genma<br/>and confirmed he really was out of it this time. Then she hefted the unconscious Ranma<br/>over her shoulders "Well... looks like you didn't dodge that one too well didja, tough<br/>guy?" she remarked sarcastically before grabbing Ranma's pack and heading home.<p>After arriving at her apartment she set him down on the futon in her now sparsely<br/>decorated room. "Wonder why he's wearin' a gi?" She mused, before remembering that<br/>she had only stopped wearing those herself because her breasts kept popping out all the<br/>time, which was really embarassing. Making sure Ranma was comfortable, she put a<br/>damp cloth on his head (she didn't know why, but it seemed to be the appropriate thing in<br/>such situations) and went to start making dinner for the both of them. This might not<br/>have been how she planned their first meeting, but she was sure that waking up to a cute<br/>girl nursing him back to health with a delicious meal would put her in a good light.<p>She was just tying her apron on when she noticed a light on her phone was blinking.<br/>Guessing she had a message, she went over and hit play to hear Nabiki's voice coming<br/>through and idly wondered how she had discovered her phone number.<p>"Ranko-san, it's Nabiki. Daddy got a postcard today from a Genma Saotome saying that<br/>he's bringing his son Ranma here for an arranged marriage to either me or one of my<br/>sisters. Don't know when the Saotomes will arrive, but I'll call you when they do. Ja ne."<p>"Heh, the fat panda will probably show up within an hour or so and scare the livin' shit<br/>outta them." She chuckled, wondering how Genma-panda would gain entrance to the<br/>Tendou home without Ranma there to smooth things along.<p>***<p>Ranma came to with a groan. "Ugh... dammit what hit me?" He sat up and took in his<br/>surroundings. He was on a futon in a fairly bare room, and his pack was nearby, which<br/>was a relief.<p>"Ara, you're awake?" The redhead from earlier entered the room and smiled at him.<p>"Uh, yeah... where am I?" He asked dumbly.<p>"You're in my apartment." She suddenly blushed and put both hands over her cheeks<br/>"Oh! It's the first time a boy has been in my room. I'm so embarassed!" She shook her<br/>head back and forth rapidly.<p>Had Ranma been paying attention he would have noted that the girl seemed to take<br/>definite amusement in her own words, alas his focus was captivated by what her sudden<br/>movements did to her chest and found himself momentarily speechless.<p>The girl noted his gaze, but rather than getting upset, she seemed rather pleased. "Oh, I<br/>don't even know your name. I am Ranko Xiawang." She bowed formally towards him<br/>"Welcome to my home."<p>"Aheh..." Ranma chuckled nervously and scratched the base of his pigtail. "I'm Ranma<br/>Saotome, pleased ta meetcha." He was about to get up and bow when Ranko's<br/>surprisingly strong hands forced him down again.<p>"No need to get up, that horrible panda knocked you out, so you should rest." She<br/>remonstrated him gently. "Dinner is almost ready, I made enough for both of us. It's<br/>ginger seasoned sukiyaki."<p>"Wow! I love sukiyaki!" Ranma said eagerly, already picking up the scent beginning to<br/>waft into the room.<p>"Then it's a good thing I made lots, isn't it?" She smirked at him "Just lay there and I'll<br/>give you a shout when it's ready, okay?"<p>"Sure!" Ranma nodded happily as Ranko glided out the room. Boy, what a nice girl!<p>***<p>[Tendou old buddy! So good to see you!] Proclaimed the sign held aloft by the enormous<br/>panda taking up the engwa of the Tendou home.<p>"Father... your friend is a... panda?" Kasumi hesitantly asked while cowering behind<br/>Soun.<p>"Does this mean one of us has to marry a panda? I know they're endangered and all, but I<br/>don't think that's the right way to go about increasing the population." Nabiki quipped,<br/>trying to mask her fear with humour.<p>Soun shook his head so fast he ran the risk of whiplash injuries.<p>The panda browfed and spun the wooden sign around to reveal a different message [If I<br/>could get some hot water, I can explain.]<p>Kasumi rushed off to get a kettle, and promptly returned. "Here you are, Panda-san." She<br/>didn't seem as scared now, rather she was amused by the antics of what was apparently a<br/>well trained circus animal. The Saotome's must be very interesting to have such a pet!<p>"That's better." Genma said after pouring the kettle over himself and reverting to a<br/>heavyset Japanese man in a gi.<p>Yes... very interesting indeed... was Kasumi's last thought before fainting.<p>Genma took in the sight of the entire Tendou family sprawled across the floor in<br/>unconsciousness. "This could take a while..." he mused.<p>***<p>"Ranma, dinner's ready!" Ranko called out as she finished setting the table.<p>"Hey, it smells great." Ranma said admiringly as he came into the living room and<br/>kneeled at the kotatsu opposite his hostess.<p>Ranko smiled genially at his compliment. Everything was going according to plan.<br/>"Itadakimas." She said before digging in, Ranma following suit.<p>Ranma was making an honest effort to watch his manners while eating, but it was still far<br/>from civilized and he knew it. A glance at Ranko, however, showed she was devouring<br/>the meal with just as much gusto. "So, Ranko..." he began, trying to make conversation<br/>inbetween eating "What happened to my pop?"<p>"Your father?" Ranko paused with her chopsticks just touching her lips and blinked in<br/>apparent confusion "I didn't see you were with anyone apart from that panda..."<p>"Oh... hehe... right. I meant what happened to the panda..." Ranma corrected himself<br/>nervously.<p>"Well..." Ranko tapped her chopsticks against her pouty lips as she seemed to be<br/>considering things "After that mean old panda knocked you out, it picked you up and ran<br/>off. I shudder to think of what it was planning to do to you..." She said in mock horror<br/>"But then it tripped and fell over." She sighed and shook her head sadly "After that I took<br/>you here so you could recover."<p>Ranma grumbled something unintelligible about stupid fiances before raising his voice<br/>and asking "Didn't it do anything after it fell over?"<p>"Oh no." Ranko's smile had a hint of cruel humour "He fell and couldn't get up."<p>Ranma snorted "Good. I hope the zoo finds him... useless old man..." he grumbled before<br/>finishing off the last of the rice and sukiyaki and brightening "That was a great, thanks!<br/>You're a wonderful cook, Ranko." he patted his stomach cheerfully.<p>Ranko had also finished her food and swiftly gathered up the dishes and placed them in<br/>the sink "Thankyou," she blushed demurely "I enjoy cooking." sitting back at the<br/>kotatsu, she changed the subject "So, are you a martial artist?" she made a show of<br/>looking up and down at his gi, although it really just looked like she was checking him<br/>out.<p>Ranma puffed himself up pridefuly "Sure am. I'm the heir to the Saotome school of<br/>Anything Goes martial arts. I noticed from the way you move," and the kick you gave<br/>Pop "that you musta had some trainin' too."<p>"Anything Goes? What a surprise, I practice that school too!"<p>"Huh, you do?" Ranma eyed her mistrustfuly "You don't have anything to do with the<br/>Tendou school do you?"<p>Ranko made a dismissive wave "That joke of a dojo? Don't be ridiculous! I defeated both<br/>the heir and master of the Tendou school last month. They can't even take on students<br/>now that I have their sign." She pointed to the sign which she had prominently placed<br/>next to the television set just for this conversation "Not that they've actually had any<br/>students in years anyway."<p>Ranma lost his suspicion and grinned at her "I guess the Tendou school can't be any good<br/>if they lost to a girl!" He wondered why on earth Pop would want him to unite the<br/>Saotome school with such an obviously weak dojo.<p>To her credit, Ranko didn't so much as twitch, although she decided a subject change was<br/>in order. "Yes well... oh! I just realised something, if you are the heir to the Saotome<br/>school, that must mean you're Nodoka's son!"<p>"Nodoka?" Ranma repeated, confused by this new topic.<p>"Yes! Your father is Genma Saotome right? You've been on a ten year training trip too,<br/>right?" Ranko had suddenly teleported from across the kotatsu so she was now kneeling<br/>right next to him, looking up at Ranma with an expression of earnest hope in her liquid<br/>blue eyes as she fired the questions at him.<p>"Uh... yeah...?" Ranma backed off a little, slightly alarmed at the sudden proximity of<br/>such a really cute girl.<p>"Oh, this is so wonderful!" Ranko gushed ecstaticly "I have to take you to meet her, I<br/>know she's been dying you see you again!"<p>"Who?"<p>"Your mother!"<p>"I have a mother?"<p>***<p>Chapter 9<p>"Of course, right away I sensed there was something fishy about this 'training ground',<br/>and I tried to impress that fact upon my idiot son. But the foolish boy just leaped onto<br/>one of the poles and started goading me..." Genma adopted a stricken look as he related<br/>his tale of woe to the assembled Tendou's who had now recovered from their shock at his<br/>transformation "I tried to keep a level head, but what kind of father would I be to allow<br/>my son to show such disrespect without disciplining him?"<p>"Quite so, Saotome-kun." Soun interjected sagely, a stern look upon his features.<p>"Indeed, Tendou-kun." Genma nodded appreciateivly at being shown some support.<br/>"Anyway, the boy does have some small skill in the art, only due to my dedicated<br/>training rather than any natural ability, so I fully intended to teach him the error of his<br/>ways and get away from this obviously cursed place. Alas he distracted me using<br/>cowardly and dishonourable tactics to-"<p>Genma's rant was cut off as Nabiki decided to interject "Y'know, this Ranma really<br/>doesn't sound like much of a marriage prospect if what half of what you told us is true,<br/>Saotome-san" Not that she believed much of it anyway, mind you.<p>Genma blinked at that. He was so much in the habit of making himself look good at the<br/>expense of his son that he had completely forgotten that one of these girls would need to<br/>want to marry Ranma for his plans to bear fruit. Coughing into his hand as he collected<br/>himself, Genma resumed his story "Um... yes... well... I went easy on the boy since he<br/>obviously couldn't be blamed for the overeagerness of youth, and he was able to knock<br/>me into one of the springs using some superb tactical awareness and flawless technique<br/>that I so painstakingly drilled into him over the years, truly he is a credit to the Saotome<br/>school." Genma paused and took a deep breath for effect "It was then that the true horror<br/>of Jusenkyo was made known to me."<p>"So that's when you became a panda?" Kasumi asked.<p>Genma nodded sollemnly "The shock of the change took the fight right out of me, luckily<br/>the guide explained that hot water would revert me to my original body."<p>"So where is this 'Ranma'?" Akane asked acidly, before huffing "Not that I care since I'm<br/>not marrying him."<p>Genma sweated nervously "We er... got seperated... but I'm sure he'll turn up, either that<br/>or I'll find him soon enough..."<p>"Why aren't you looking for him now, Saotome-kun?" Soun asked "Then we can get a<br/>priest in here and he'll marry one of my girls and inherit the dojo!"<p>"WHAT?" Amazingly enough, that scream came from all three of Soun's daughters,<br/>who were less than impressed at this latest revalation.<p>"I thought I was the heir to the dojo?" Akane got right in her father's face as she<br/>furiously made her displeasure known.<p>"Excuse me, but who is it that has kept us solvent all these years while you just sit in the<br/>dojo breaking bricks? If anyone is going to inherit the dojo it should be me." Nabiki<br/>cooly interjected after calming herself from the previous joint outburst.<p>"Oh my, so I suppose all these years I've spent looking after the three of you and giving<br/>up on my education counts for nothing?" Kasumi's everpresent smile was in serious<br/>danger of slipping at this point.<p>Soun whimpered like a whipped puppy at his daughters' collective anger "But if I give<br/>the dojo as a wedding gift to whichever one of you marries Saotome-kun's son, then we<br/>don't have to pay inheritance tax..."<p>Nabiki seemed somewhat mollified by this argument, Akane and Kasumi however were<br/>not, so Soun tried a different tack "Well you can't all inherit it! Surely it's more fair to<br/>give it to whichever of you marries Ranma?" The last came out as a trembling whisper as<br/>he cringed at the awful sight of Kasumi and Akane's combined glare (actually in<br/>Kasumi's case it was her usual smile with just a little teeth shown and her left eyebrow<br/>twitching up a storm).<p>Nabiki just sighed and excused herself. She had a phonecall to make.<p>***<p>"So, are you nervous?" Ranko looked up at her companion with a cheerful grin as they<br/>walked to the Saotome residence on the outskirts of Nerima.<p>"Kinda..." Ranma chuckled nervously, he was now dressed in a Chinese style red shirt<br/>and silk trousers which he had recently purchased but kept in his pack until now since he<br/>could still get away with wearing a gi. "I mean, I haven't seen her in ten years, I don't<br/>even remember her. Will she even like me?" He asked, sounding rather lost and unsure<br/>of himself.<p>"Don't worry, you have nothing to worry about..." Ranko's happy smile turned into a<br/>frown as she trailed off sullenly, thinking about her mother back in her old life. She still<br/>had nightmares about the time Nodoka had acted out making her commit seppuku in her<br/>sleep while staying over at the Tendou's. At least this Ranma wouldn't have the image of<br/>his mother forever tainted in such a horrible manner.<p>Ranma, of course, failed to notice anything, too wrapped up in his own concerns.<p>After walking in silence for a while, the pair finally reached Nodoka's house, and Ranko<br/>knocked on the door while Ranma started to fidget nervously. "You'll be fine." she gave<br/>him a reassuring smile which he reciprocated just before Nodoka answered the door.<p>"Ranko-chan!" The kimono-clad woman exclaimed happily at seeing her guest "What a<br/>surprise. Who's your..." she looked at Ranma and trailed off, an expression of earnest<br/>hope on her face.<p>"M... mom?" Ranma choked out, his emotions overwhelming him at the sight of the<br/>woman forgotten to his memory, but not to his heart.<p>"Ranma?" Nodoka breathed, raising a hand up to his cheek almost as if to check he were<br/>real and not a mirage.<p>Ranma clasped her hand and nodded, finding speech beyond him at this point.<p>"Oh Ranma! My baby boy has come back!" Nodoka cried, forgetting decorum as she<br/>dove forward and enveloped her son in a massive hug, tears streaming down her cheeks<br/>"My son, I've waited so long for this day!"<p>"Mom... I've missed you so much..." Ranma whispered as he awkwardly returned the<br/>hug, feeling totally blown away by the unconditional love he was feeling from his long<br/>lost mother.<p>Ranko sniffed as she turned away from the heartwarming reunion. That was how it<br/>should have been for her, she thought while wiping at her eyes, cursing the dust that must<br/>have somehow flown into them.<p>Eventually, Nodoka withdrew from the hug, but kept her hands on Ranma's shoulders<br/>"Let me look at you, son." she gushed "Oh, I knew you'd grow up to be a handsome,<br/>manly young man! I'm so proud!"<p>Ranma blushed and fiddled with his pigtail under her glowing appraisal "Thanks<br/>mom..." he muttered, slightly embarrased.<p>Nodoka seemed to collect herself as she recalled her other guest "Ranko-chan, are you...<br/>crying?"<p>Ranma snapped out of his daze and turned his attention to the petite redhead who was<br/>shirking from their combined gazes.<p>"I... I'm just so happy seeing you two finally reunited is all..." Ranko brushed at her face,<br/>wishing a hole in the ground would swallow her up rather than have them continue to<br/>stare at her when she was acting so weak and pathetic. Even if she was trying to be<br/>feminine, she still had her standards.<p>Nodoka smiled understandingly while Ranma just looked on awkwardly, not knowing<br/>what to do or say.<p>"Oh, why are we standing out here in the cold! Come in you two, come in!" Nodoka<br/>stepped back into the house and ushered the two teenagers in. "I haven't eaten yet so I'll<br/>make dinner for all of us. Is stewed daikon okay?"<p>Neither Ranma or Ranko mentioned that they had just eaten, and both shared a secretive<br/>smile as they realised their thoughts were on the same wavelength.<p>***<p>Nabiki hung up the phone after leaving a message telling Ranko that Genma had arrived,<br/>while leaving out the more unbelievable aspects of his arrival. Who'd have thought a<br/>man could turn into a panda? It certainly rocked Nabiki's world view.<p>Then there was the question of Genma's missing son coupled with Ranko's interest in the<br/>Saotome's. Given what Ranko had done to the Tendou dojo, perhaps she had waylaid<br/>and attacked Ranma and that was why he wasn't here?<p>Nabiki shook her head to clear away such thoughts. She had too little information to<br/>make such wild guesses. Instead she returned to the foyer and was surprised to see Akane<br/>and Kasumi arguing.<p>"Well I thought you were going to marry Tofu-sensei anyway?" Akane cried bitterly,<br/>distraught that her big sister had the love of the man she wanted, and was now trying to<br/>take the dojo that should rightfuly go to the school's heir; Akane.<p>Kasumi gagged "Akane! He's thirty two years old! I'm still a teenager, I think I can do<br/>better than that, thank you very much."<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow as she listened in. She agreed with Kasumi about the age<br/>difference, but it was still a surprise to hear her normally placid big sister spell things out<br/>so bluntly.<p>Akane blinked in surprise "But you're always so nice to him, and he acts funny whenever<br/>he sees you or even hears your name!"<p>Kasumi threw up her hands in exasparation, this whole engagement business was<br/>destroying her usual meek facade "I'm nice to everybody!" Kasumi yelled in frustration<br/>"And don't you think I know about his 'acting funny'? Why do you think I have to study<br/>all those medical books? He nearly twisted my ankle off last time I went in for a<br/>checkup!"<p>Soun and Genma were just looking on in shock as the girls argued back and forth.<br/>Eventually a grin spread across Soun's face "Just look, Saotome-kun, all of my daughters<br/>are eager to marry your boy!"<p>"Haha, of course Tendou-kun! It's that old Saotome charm! The ladies can't resist!"<p>"Now the schools will be joined for sure!"<p>***<p>Ranko had a bittersweet smile after sharing dinner with Ranma and Nodoka. Not once<br/>had the topic of seppuku pledges come up, nor had Nodoka so much as glanced at her<br/>katana. It really was a world of difference from what she knew.<p>Now she was listening to Ranma detail his training over the years to a rapt audience of<br/>one. Ranko wasn't that impressed since she knew Ranma was actually toning it down for<br/>his mother's benefit, but she made the appropriate impressed noises when she felt it<br/>necessary.<p>"So Ranma, where is your father?" Nodoka asked after Ranma had finished his tale.<p>Ranma shrugged "Probably at his friends place. Tendou something or other."<p>Nodoka looked distant for a moment as if she was trying to remember something before<br/>she slapped her fist into an open palm "Oh, I remember! Soun Tendou, that boy who was<br/>always hanging around with Genma before we got married. But why is he there instead<br/>of here?" She asked with a definite tone of disapproval.<p>"Well, he wanted me ta marry one of Tendou's daughters, so I beat him up then bumped<br/>into Ranko here," he hooked a thumb at the redhead "and then she took me to see you."<p>Nodoka grinned widely as she nodded "Of course, so you're going to marry Ranko-chan<br/>aren't you?"<p>Ranma did a classic spit take with his tea and turned to look at Ranko who was giggling<br/>nervously "What?"<p>Nodoka looked puzzled "Didn't Ranko tell you? We agreed that she would marry you<br/>when you returned from your training trip."<p>"I ain't got no time for fiances!" Ranma yelled in a panicked voice before composing<br/>himself (slightly) "Besides, girls are a distraction from the art!"<p>"Well, Ranko has an interest in the art, and I think she's a lovely girl. Is there something<br/>wrong with her?" Nodoka asked, frowning.<p>Ranma waved his hands in a a panicked gesture "No no no! She's real nice and all, but I<br/>just met her." He turned a betrayed look towards Ranko "And why didn't you tell me<br/>you're my fiance?"<p>Ranko was starting to panic herself, things were suddenly going badly for her when she'd<br/>thought it was all under control. She was so used to just blithely accepting new fiances<br/>turning up that she'd forgotten how against the engagements she'd been at the very<br/>beginning. "Um... I... I..." shit, shit, think of something genius! she mentally remonstrated<br/>herself "I wanted to surprise you?" she finished lamely.<p>"Well mission accomplished!" Ranma yelled angrily.<p>"Ranma!" Nodoka interjected in a steely voice "Even if you don't accept the engagement,<br/>that is still no way to talk to a young lady."<p>"Sorry mom..." Ranma mumbled.<p>Nodoka massaged her temples "Yes well, things obviously aren't going to be resolved<br/>easily. I suppose we should visit the Tendou's and see what my husband has to say about<br/>all this. Do either of you know where their home is?"<p>"I go to school with two of the Tendou's, I know where it is." Ranko piped up miserably,<br/>not knowing how she had screwed up so badly.<p>"Good, we'd best be off then." Nodoka gathered up her katana before leaving.<p>Nope, that sure isn't a good sign, Ranko thought glumly as she fell in step behind the<br/>Saotomes.<p>***
