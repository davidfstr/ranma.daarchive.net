</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris<p>Chapter 6<p>"Give me back my ribbon you little harridan!"<p>Azusa turned to face her pursuer while still speeding away on her rollerblades "It's my<br/>Martinique, I won't let you have it!" She retorted, sticking her tongue out for effect.<p>Ranko was just returning home from her dinner with Nodoka when she spotted the pair<br/>heading in her direction. Deciding to help mete out a little justice towards the klepto figure<br/>skater, she innocently stuck her foot out as Azusa passed, causing her to fall sprawling on<br/>her ass.<p>"Aha! I have you now you little thief!" Kodachi exclaimed jubilantly as she retrieved her<br/>ribbon before turning an appreciative gaze towards the redhead "Thankyou for your<br/>assistance... er... I believe we met the other day but you didn't give me your name..." She<br/>trailed off expectantly.<p>Ranko blinked. It felt weird having to introduce herself to a girl she still thought of as one of<br/>her admirers. "I'm Ranko Xiawang." She gave a brief bow "Besides, it's a martial artist's<br/>duty to stop thieves." Unless you happen to be the thief yourself, she added silently, thinking<br/>of Genma.<p>Azusa had recovered by this point and was trying to steal Kodachi's ribbon again, but the<br/>taller girl was able to keep it out of her reach easily. "Give me my Martinique back!" She<br/>yelled shrilly.<p>"I think not." Kodachi responded drolly "Why don't you buy your own? They aren't exactly<br/>expensive."<p>"No!" Azusa was right in Kodachi's face as she yelled "That's my little Martinique! Azusa-<br/>chan challenges you for it!"<p>Ranko winced. This was not going to be pretty.<p>"A challenge, you say?" Kodachi looked down haughtily at the figure skater, an expression<br/>of ill concealed mirth on her aristocratic features.<p>Azusa stomped her foot at not being taken seriously. That she was able to stomp sucessfully<br/>while wearing rollerblades was testament to her skill in her chosen field of weird martial arts<br/>"I challenge you to a martial arts figure skating match, tomorrow after school!"<p>Kodachi nodded slowly, a sly grin on her face. "Yes, let us fight in all fairness... Before the<br/>match!" Suddenly her ribbon lashed out to wrap around Azusa, before a flick of Kodachi's<br/>wrist sent the smaller girl flying into a wall.<p>"Oooh, Martinique... why did you hurt little Azusa, why?" Azusa moaned groggily as she<br/>picked herself up and caressed part of the ribbon which was still wrapped around her.<br/>Seeming to collect herself, she returned her attention to her opponent who was smirking at<br/>her "Hey! I said tomor-augh!" She never finished as a deft tug of the ribbon from Kodachi<br/>sent her spinning as it unraveled.<p>Ranko had by now taken a seat on a nearby fence and was greatly enjoying watching a crazy<br/>martial arts battle that for once did not involve her. She was certainly wishing Kodachi had<br/>been around during her own encounter with the Golden Pair, since the gymnast seemed to<br/>have things well in hand.<p>Before long, Kodachi had Azusa trussed up once more and left her dangling from a<br/>streetlight. "I think I'll let you keep the ribbon after all. Give my regards to the Kolkhoz<br/>High rhythmic gymnastics team." She let loose a burst of her bone chilling laughter and was<br/>surprised to hear clapping. Turning to the noise, she was mildly surprised that the redhead<br/>was still there, since most people would have vacated the area during the fight.<p>"Nicely done." Ranko congratulated Kodachi as she hopped down from her perch.<p>"Er.. thankyou." Kodachi demurred, again surprised that this girl wasn't yelling and<br/>screaming about her being an overaggressive psycho, which is what most people did. Of<br/>course, the opinions of such peasants were beneath one of her station, so she tried not to let it<br/>get to her.<p>"Yeah, her and that creep Mikado are both jerks. I'm glad you put her in her place." Ranko<br/>said while hooking a thumb in Azusa's direction. During the short fight, Ranko had done<br/>some thinking. She didn't have any friends in this new timeline, and from the way Kodachi<br/>had latched onto 'Ranma-sama' she knew that the gymnast was terribly lonely, despite the<br/>front she put up. Maybe this time they could actually be proper friends instead of Kodachi<br/>alternating between loving or hating her depending on local water temperatures. "Say,<br/>Kodachi. Do you want to go get some icecream or somethin'?" She had just eaten, but she<br/>never let trivialities like that get to her.<p>Kodachi blinked owlishly at her "Are you asking me out?"<p>Ranko immediately got a wide eyed and panicked expression "No, no! It ain't like that!" She<br/>waved her hands frantically "I just meant, like as friends y'know, two girls! It's not a date if<br/>we're both girls!"<p>Kodachi put a hand over her mouth and chuckled in a surprisingly natural and not scary<br/>manner as she watched Ranko flounder. "You've obviously never attended an all girls<br/>school..." She muttered quietly.<p>"Huh?" Ranko peered curiously at her, not sure what to make of that statement, being<br/>surprisingly naive in such matters despite her curse.<p>"Not me! I'm not gay!" Kodachi suddenly blurted out under Ranko's intense scrutiny "I just<br/>meant there are other girls at St Hebereke that do.. do... that..." She trailed off lamely while<br/>twiddling her index fingers.<p>"Oh... right... So um... you wanna go or not?" Ranko asked, wondering how on earth they<br/>had ended up on the topic of Kodachi's sexuality.<p>Gathering up the tattered remnants of her dignity, Kodachi nodded imperiously "Yes. I<br/>believe I would like that." And the pair walked off into the sunset, the beginnings of a<br/>beautiful new friendship in the making.<p>"Hello? Little Azusa is sorry. Can someone let me down now?" A forlorn voice called out,<br/>though there was no one there to hear. "Please?"<p>Pretty soon a group of small children arrived and pronounced judgement on the hapless<br/>kleptomaniac "Let's doodle on her!"<p>***<p>"So, earlier you mentioned you were a martial artist. What style do you practice?" Kodachi<br/>asked her companion as the two sat in a booth at the same icecream shop Shampoo had<br/>demolished in her search for Ranma back in Ranko's old life.<p>Ranko smirked cockily "Anything Goes. I'm the best there is."<p>Kodachi looked to be considering something for a moment before she spoke up "Isn't<br/>Anything Goes the style practiced by that girl my brother is enamoured with? Something<br/>Tendou?"<p>Ranko snorted "Feh, Akane Tendou? She just does regular kempo. Callin' that Anything<br/>Goes is an insult."<p>"Really?" Kodachi arched an eyebrow "From the way Tatewaki goes on about her I assumed<br/>she was some avatar of martial arts prowess brought to life."<p>Ranko shrugged "Well, she's good at kempo, but that's just a tiny fraction of what Anything<br/>Goes is all about. Kempo is just a regular martial art you can learn at dojos' all over the<br/>country. Anything Goes is the most powerful style in the world, and only a few people know<br/>it."<p>"You seem to think very highly of your skills." Kodachi remarked dryly.<p>Ranko just nodded, not finding anything to dispute in that statement "I've dedicated my<br/>whole life to the art, what would be the point if I had no noteworthy skills to show for it?"<br/>She sighed sadly "Sometimes I feel like it's all I have."<p>Kodachi looked askance at the slight redhead who was apparently opening up to her. Her?<br/>The Black Rose of St Hebereke? The thought was almost enough to make her laugh. Instead<br/>she decided to take a chance and maybe open up a little herself. "I..." she began hesitantly,<br/>pushing the dregs of her sundae around her dish "I... sometimes feel the same way. There are<br/>times when I feel I could lock myself in my greenhouse and spend the rest of my days<br/>tending to the flowers, and not a person in the world would care. And I wonder if I would<br/>care? The roses never judge me or try to make me into someone I'm not..."<p>Ranko stared in slack jawed shock. In five minutes having a friendly chat, she'd gotten more<br/>out of Kodachi than nearly a year of having the girl supposedly in love with her. "What<br/>about your gymnastics?" She asked.<p>Kodachi laughed. Not her maniacal 'crazed noblewoman' laugh, but a bitter and cold laugh<br/>filled with self loathing. "I don't even like gymnastics." She stopped with a pole axed look, as<br/>if she couldn't believe what she had just admitted "I actually said it..." she whispered in an<br/>awed tone "I hate gymnastics... I hate it..." A strange grin split her face as she stood up and<br/>yelled "I Kodachi Kuno despise rhythmic gymnastics!"<p>Several apathetic grunts from the other patrons was her response, but Kodachi didn't let it<br/>deter her. Instead she sat back down with an enormous smile as if she had figured out one of<br/>life's great mysteries.<p>"Uh..." Ranko was rather overwhelmed by this. All this time and she'd never had a clue.. "If<br/>you hate it, then why do you do it?"<p>Kodachi deflated in on herself a little "Back before father... left... he was concerned over my<br/>spending too much time on my botany studies and suggested I take up a sport. His<br/>suggestion consisted of sticking me on the rythmic gymnastics team and telling me to do the<br/>Kuno name proud..." She had a faraway look in her eyes as she whispered "Kuno's never<br/>lose."<p>Ranko barely avoided bursting into laughter as she thought of Kodachi's brother, but<br/>knowing that this was some sort of breakthrough for the other girl helped keep her calm. "So<br/>that's why you always ambushed the other teams? To always win?"<p>Kodachi nodded "Yes. But that stops now! First thing tomorrow I'm quitting the team. If<br/>father is too busy to look after us, I fail to see why I should 'honour' him by carrying out his<br/>wishes." Impulsively she leaned over and hugged Ranko "I should have done this years ago.<br/>Thankyou for letting me see that."<p>Ranko still had a shell shocked look on her face as she replied "I didn't do anything..."<p>"Hmm, you're right. But I wouldn't have been able to realise that I was wasting my time on<br/>something I hated if we hadn't had this talk."<p>"So... are ya goin' to spend more time on flowers and stuff now that you're not a gymnast?"<br/>Ranko asked, weirded out at this abrupt lifestlye change from someone she thought she had<br/>pegged.<p>"Perhaps..." Kodachi mused "Or maybe I'll find something else I enjoy. I am only sixteen<br/>after all, I have my whole life to find out."<p>Ranko smiled happily "That's a good attitude to take Kodachi."<p>***<p>That night, Happosai lay still in his blankets in Ranko's living room. He was trying to sleep<br/>but he couldn't. They were calling to him.<p>"Help us, Happosai..." a small voice begged.<p>"Please, you are the only one who can end our unjust servitude." another called out, the<br/>feminine voice choked with emotion.<p>"If you can rescue us..." the throaty voice trailed off, seeming to hint at a thousand pleasures<br/>that would be bestowed upon it's benefactor.<p>Unable to stand it any longer, Happosai leapt from his bedding "Fear not my silky darlings!<br/>I'm coming to save you!"<p>He was about to leave via the window and resume his righteous crusade when another voice<br/>impinged on his consciousness. He was barely able to make out the distressed moans and<br/>low whimpering coming from Ranko's room, and wondered what could cause her to have<br/>nightmares when she had seemed so happy earlier when she returned from Nodoka's.<p>Happosai was struck by momentary indecision. Ranko had made some pretty dire warnings<br/>about what would happen if she caught him in her room at night, and his silky darlings<br/>weren't going to rescue themselves. But the noises from her room tugged at his withered old<br/>heart. What kind of martial arts master would he be to let a pretty girl suffer nightmares?<p>That did it. Firm in his convictions, Happosai stealthily entered Ranko's room and crept up<br/>to the bed where his student was tossing and turning, having kicked her covers off in the<br/>night. Luckily her modesty was protected by a set of blue pajama's. Happosai tutted at that, a<br/>girl like her should adorned in the finest silk lingerie, yet she refused to wear the items he<br/>had been willing to sacrifice from his own collection.<p>"Mmm... gettaway... please pop... I don't wanna..." She half murmered, rolling over and<br/>conking Happosai on the head with an outstretched arm.<p>Happosai furrowed his already wrinkled brow as he wondered just what she was dreaming<br/>about. From the way it sounded... had her father...?<p>"No... don' like... cats..." a muffled sob came out before she shrieked "Not my eyes!" and<br/>curled up in a fetal position, shuddering violently.<p>Cats? Wondered Happosai, dismissing his earlier suspicions about her father. It was<br/>probably just a meaningless dream, nothing more. He briefly considered waking her from the<br/>nightmare before deciding she needed her beauty sleep. Instead he whipped an incense<br/>burner out of stuffspace along with several rare herbs. With the ease of long practice, he<br/>prepared the proper solution and set it burning on her nightstand.<p>Within a few moments, Ranko stretched out of the fetal position and a smile crossed her<br/>unconscious features. It seemed her dreams had turned to a more soothing type. Happosai<br/>nodded to himself in satisfaction and pulled the blankets back over the slumbering teenager.<p>"Now my silky darlings, I've kept you waiting long enough!" The old letch whispered before<br/>bounding out of the apartment, seeking to further his lifelong quest.<p>***<p>Chapter 7<p>Ranko paused in her kata to wipe some sweat from her brow as she reflected over the past<br/>couple of weeks. All in all, her new life was going pretty smoothly, even though she still<br/>couldn't wait to return to her old one. Akane had attacked her at school a few times, but she<br/>was able to put the tomboy down with little fuss each time. It seemed her relationship with<br/>Akane in this life had all the bad parts of her old one with none of the good. Not that she was<br/>surprised at this, since she had done nothing but antagonise the poor girl since arriving.<p>More surprising were the two Kuno siblings. Kuno had not once said a single word to her,<br/>which was really weird since she was just as attractive and skilled as the 'pigtailed girl' but<br/>way more feminine acting. She was occasionaly tempted to just ask Kuno why the hell he<br/>wasn't obsessing over her, but decided that it would be best not to look a gift horse in the<br/>mouth.<p>She still couldn't believe Kodachi had given up rhythmic gymnastics so abruptly. While the<br/>Black Rose was still borderline insane, she was surprisingly good company when not trying<br/>to steal kisses with paralysis powder or yelling about the pigtailed girl stealing her Ranma-<br/>sama. With any luck, the fact that her new friend Ranko had a claim on Ranma would keep<br/>Kodachi from falling for him this time around. Plus, Kodachi was a genius, and had helped<br/>Ranko with her schoolwork quite a bit.<p>Happosai was still hard to figure out. He was just as much a pervert as always, but for some<br/>reason Ranko was considered off limits. she thought it might be because she was his student,<br/>but that had never stopped him tormenting 'Ranma-chan', so it had to be something else. He<br/>had disappeared yesterday to attend the 'All Japan Cheerleading Finals' in Okinawa, and<br/>likely wouldn't be back for a week or so, which would at least give Ranko time to do<br/>something about all the stolen underwear cluttering up her apartment.<p>She was about to resume her exercises when she noticed a group of boys ogling her. If there<br/>wasn't one thing she missed about living in a dojo, it was peace to practice her art<br/>undisturbed. She liked doing katas in the park since it was relaxing to be outside in the<br/>sunshine, but those damned perverts always showed up to leer at her. If she didn't do<br/>something to scare them off soon, then no doubt they'd work up the nerve to come over and<br/>start hitting on her. She couldn't really blame them, since she was one of the hottest girls she<br/>knew, and her affectionately named 'sexy kunoichi' outfit she wore when practicing only<br/>added to that, but it still pissed her off having to deal with horny boys.<p>Nodding to herself as she settled on a plan, Ranko leapt into an advanced kata of her own<br/>devising which incorporated many chops and knife hand strikes at amaguriken speed. The<br/>net effect was similar to Kuno's air pressure trick, and she proceeded to neatly prune a<br/>nearby willow tree from several metres away. After winding down, she turned on the boys<br/>with a cruel smirk and popped her knuckles while manifesting a small battle aura.<p>"Feh." she tossed her hair arrogantly as the boys ran off in terror "That should give me some<br/>peace and quiet."<p>After an hour or so of uninterrupted martial arts fun (though it would have been more fun if<br/>someone had attacked her while screaming 'Ranko, prepare to die!' - she really wished she<br/>had some decent rivals in this life) she was finishing up and preparing to go home when she<br/>spotted a familiar figure walking a zigzag path through the park. "Ryouga?" She whispered<br/>upon seeing the telltale red umbrella strapped to an enormous backpack.<p>Indeed it was Ryouga Hibiki, who had been trying to intercept Ranma at Shanghai and was<br/>rather surprised to find himself back in Japan. The lost boy was asking for directions from<br/>anyone who came close to him, and then walking off perpendicular to whichever way those<br/>kind souls would point in.<p>Ranko sighed at the sight. She felt sorry for him, she really did, but there was no way in hell<br/>she was going to offer any assistance. Given how easily Ryouga fell in love with any pretty<br/>girl that so much as said hello in a friendly manner, she did not want that kind of hassle. She<br/>shuddered as she remembered the koi rod incident, it had only been Ryouga's intense dislike<br/>for his rival that had saved her then, if Ryouga actually liked her and pulled a stunt like that<br/>though... being that moron's love slave for life was not a pleasant proposition.<p>She was about to leave the park in the opposite direction when some children playing by a<br/>fountain splashed Ryouga, resulting in a damp pile of clothes with a small piglet struggling<br/>to get out.<p>"No way..." she breathed, wondering how Ryouga had gotten himself cursed if Ranma<br/>hadn't, then she giggled to herself "It must be karma!" Not wanting to leave her onetime<br/>rival in such a vulnerable state, she went to a nearby kiosk and bought a cup of tea and some<br/>chocolate. Promptly devouring the confection, she drank half the hot tea and walked over<br/>towards the sad little piglet which was trotting round in circles, no doubt wondering who had<br/>placed it in such a fiendish maze. As she walked past, she dropped the styrofoam cup full of<br/>tea onto the pig and continued walking without a backwards glance.<p>Ryouga, for his part, scrambled to retrieve his clothes before he was branded a pervert, not<br/>questioning his luck in escaping his awful cursed form.<p>Ranko was just leaving the park when she heard the familiar yell of "Damn you Ranma!<br/>This is all your fault!" and couldn't help but smile to herself.<p>***<p>"Ranko Xiawang, I challenge you!"<p>"Aw crud." Ranko slapped her forehead as she found Akane waiting outside her apartment<br/>building. It was getting to the point where she was developing a reflex for pounding Akane<br/>on sight like she used to pound Kuno, and that would only spell disaster when she returned<br/>to her old life. "Lemme alone you stupid tomboy." She huffed exasparatedly.<p>"I won't rest until I recover our dojo sign! And don't expect me to go easy on you this time."<br/>Akane adopted a Ryouga-esque pose of righteous anger.<p>"That's my line." Ranko muttered as she fought down the urge to just blast Akane with a<br/>Mouko Takabisha so she could get inside and make dinner. "Look Akane, you're a hundred<br/>years too young to beat me. Go home." She knew that when Cologne used that line on her it<br/>only served to spur her on, but for some reason Ranko expected Akane to simply aquiese to<br/>her superior wisdom and give up. It was true too, since the battle dougi had shown what<br/>Akane could be capable of if she lived to be as old as the ghoul and actually trained<br/>properly, and it wasn't all that impressive as far as she was concerned.<p>Akane purpled with rage at the slight to her skills. "I'll show you! Yaa!" She charged<br/>forward with her oh so predictable thrust kick opening.<p>"Geez Akane, you start with that attack every time and it hasn't worked once." Ranko<br/>commented from her position perched atop Akane's head. She then hopped off and set about<br/>lazily dodging all of her foe's attacks as she pondered how to take Akane out today.<p>One of the first things she had done since Happosai had started living with her and treating<br/>her nicely was to get him to teach some of those nifty pressure point attacks he and Cologne<br/>were so fond of. From her training under Genma she only knew a few simple ones to knock<br/>someone out or paralyse limbs, but Happosai had been all too happy to teach her some of the<br/>more esoteric attacks, and she was currently wondering if any were appropriate to use on<br/>Akane now. She didn't want to do anything permanent or really nasty like the Cat's Tongue<br/>or Ultimate Weakness Moxibustion, just a little something to inconvienience the tomboy and<br/>amuse herself.<p>Settling on a plan, the redhead flipped over Akane, who had given up any kind of finesse and<br/>was now just flailing wildly at her opponent, and poked several spots around her kidneys.<p>"What did you do to me?" Akane demanded after an abrupt full body shudder.<p>"I just hit your 'uncontrollable incontinence point'. There's a public restroom over there."<br/>Ranko pointed to a small building a few hundred yards down the street "I suggest you<br/>hurry."<p>"Incontinence point? Don't be ridicul-" Akane suddenly got a wide eyed look and clenched<br/>her legs together. She whimpered slightly and started crabwalking as fast as she could in the<br/>direction Ranko had indicated.<p>"Heh..." Ranko chuckled "There's just way too much potential to abuse stuff like that." It<br/>certainly wasn't the most honourable way to finish the fight, but as far as she was concerned<br/>Akane deserved what she got for stepping so far out of her league. With any luck it would<br/>convince her to leave well enough alone for at least a few days.<p>***<p>The next day at school, Ranko was surprised to be approached by one Nabiki Tendou after<br/>lessons had ended. "Ranko-san, I'd like to talk to you a moment." the middle Tendou sister<br/>intercepted the redhead as she was just leaving the gate.<p>"Something I can do for you Nabiki-sempai?" Ranko asked, expecting this was about the<br/>dojo sign, and wondering why it had taken Nabiki so long to get involved.<p>Of course, the reason Nabiki had not gotten involved was simple apathy. The dojo had no<br/>students anyway, so the sign was meaningless as far as she was concerned, and she<br/>personally had found Akane's 'quest' to be a source of incredible amusement. But last night<br/>her entire family had ganged up on her to come up with a solution after little sister's latest<br/>ignoble failure, which was why she was now here despite her better judgement.<p>Because despite her unflappable exterior, Ranko scared Nabiki a bit. Nabiki had no<br/>blackmail information on the mysterious girl who had so abruptly went from complete<br/>nobody to focus of attention for most of the school a few weeks ago, and Nabiki had no<br/>desire to be victim to whatever Ranko had done to Akane last night. Then there were the<br/>rumours that Ranko was friends with Kodachi Kuno, and if the rumours and what her<br/>brother himself told her was true, the Black Rose was one seriously twisted bitch. Nope, if<br/>Nabiki had a choice, she would not be touching this situation with a ten foot bargepole.<p>"Look Ranko-san, it's simple. My family has asked me to retrieve our dojo's sign. What do<br/>you want for it?" Nabiki winced internally, she was starting from a very weak position, and<br/>had essentially just handed over all negotiating power to her foe, but she really had no idea<br/>what Ranko wanted, nor anything to use as leverage. There was Ranko's connection to that<br/>bastard panty thief, but bringing that up would drive her own family name through the muck<br/>since he was the grandmaster of their school.<p>Ranko shook her head "Sorry Nabiki, it's a matter of honour."<p>Nabiki almost growled, but retained her control "Look Ranko, I don't give a rat's ass about<br/>you martial artists and your archaic concepts of honour. There has to be something I can do<br/>to get that sign back?" Gods this must really be hurting her reputation if anyone could hear<br/>her practically begging for the stupid piece of wood.<p>Ranko was about to make another flat denial when a brilliant idea suddenly struck her. "I<br/>might have an idea Nabiki, why don't we discuss this over dinner? Your treat?" She smirked<br/>evilly, remembering all the times Nabiki had screwed her over for a little yen.<p>***<p>Shoulda known better... Ranko reflected as she twirled her chopsticks in the substandard<br/>bowl of cheap ramen. When Nabiki had taken her to this little yatai she hadn't the heart to<br/>put up a fuss about going somewhere more upscale. "Okay Nabiki, it's like this. I can't give<br/>the sign back yet, but I can promise to return it soon. But only after certain conditions are<br/>met."<p>"What conditions would those be?" Nabiki asked guardedly, ignoring the sole glass of water<br/>she had ordered, seeing no need to waste more of her money when she could eat a proper<br/>meal upon returning home.<p>"Well..." Ranko hesitated, wondering how much of her hand she should play "Firstly, I need<br/>you to tell me if your family is contacted by anyone named Saotome." In her old life she had<br/>arrived this coming Sunday, but she had no way of knowing if that would hold for the<br/>uncursed Ranma in this world.<p>"Why would we be contacted by this Saotome? I don't know that name."<p>Ranko smiled wanly "It's a matter of honour. I can't tell you the details yet..." Because she<br/>knew Nabiki would use those to ferret out more information, and she didn't want the<br/>Tendous' to be too well informed "But I have an interest in that family. Anyway, that's all I<br/>need from you. Once I have settled my business with the Saotomes, I'll return the sign." She<br/>considered just outright warning Nabiki off 'her fiance' but was concerned if she did that and<br/>it got back to Ranma he'd see her as some violent psycho chick.<p>"That's it? You just want me to tell you if we are contacted by anyone named Saotome?"<br/>Nabiki asked suspiciously, it sounded way too simple.<p>Ranko shrugged "I guess. Tell Akane to stop bothering me too."<p>"Right..." Nabiki drawled out. As if she had any way of controlling her violent little sister.<br/>"Well, I guess that's enough. Bye." She got up and left, tonight she'd be asking her father all<br/>about this 'Saotome'. There had to be more to this than Ranko was letting on, and Nabiki<br/>wanted answers.<p>"Bye." Ranko waved Nabiki off and considered her poor quality ramen. Oh well, she'd had<br/>worse, she drained the bowl in one long gulp and went home.<p>***
