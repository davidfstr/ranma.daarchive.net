</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan<p>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>Chapter 20<br/>by Ebiris<p>Ranko curiously eyed her mysterious package. She was getting a strange feeling of<br/>nameless dread every time she went near it, and it was making her uneasy. Why on Earth<br/>had she received it anyway? It would have made a bit more sense if it had been addressed<br/>to her, but it was supposed to be sent to some place called Ice Station Zebra, and she had<br/>most definitely not sent anything that way. Even if she had, she would have paid full<br/>postage for it.<p>"Hmmm..." she stroked her chin in contemplation as she tried to puzzle out this latest<br/>conundrum in her life. Abruptly, the realisation hit her. "I know!" she exclaimed while<br/>hitting her palm with a closed fist. "Ranko Xiawang must have sent it before I became<br/>Ranko Xiawang!" It made sense, since Antarctica was so far away, it would surely take<br/>more than a month to get there and back, right?<p>Cheerfully ignoring her misgivings now that she had figured out its origin, she easily<br/>lifted the top off the box, ripping nails out and scattering them everywhere.<p>"Huh?"<p>A box full of men's underwear?<p>Correction, a box full of *moving* men's underwear.<p>"Yaah!" Ranko scooted away from the box, now recognising all the signs of demonic<br/>possession. Sadly, despite her formidable martial arts skils, this was not something she<br/>was really equipped to handle, even moreso when she was hungover. Grabbing her<br/>phonebook, she started rifling through the pages to locate the nearest temple, all the<br/>while keeping a wary eye on the box of cursed underwear, which so far was not making<br/>any hostile moves...<p>Suddenly, a tiny wrinkled hand emerged from the depths of the sweaty undergarments,<br/>prompting Ranko to blanch severely. It had *eaten* someone! This was serious!<p>Before she could formulate a decent plan for dealing with carnivorous demonic boxer<br/>shorts, a familiar head followed the hand in emerging. "Air! Sweet fresh air!" the master<br/>of Anything Goes declared before pausing and looking around. "Ranko-chan? You saved<br/>me!" He crawled out of the box and leapt onto Ranko's bosom, giving her a heartfelt hug<br/>(heartfelt for Happosai meaning no groping).<p>"Gramps? Wow, kinda ironic that you got eaten by an underwear demon, huh?" the<br/>redhead noted, making no effort to dislodge him, since it was a genuine hug and not a<br/>'hentai-mega-glomp'.<p>"Demon? What are you talking about? It was Nabiki who stuffed me in there!" Happosai<br/>told her.<p>Ranko looked surprised. She would never have thought Nabiki would have it in her to<br/>actually go up against Happosai like that. Normally if there was any risk of danger to<br/>herself, she'd come up with a plan and then dupe someone else into doing it for her. "How<br/>did she manage that?"<p>"Well, it was a team effort. First, Akane poisoned me with some strange toxin not even I<br/>have encountered before. Then, when I was at my weakest, begging for aid, I was packed<br/>into that disgusting box." He disengaged himself from Ranko and swayed about, looking<br/>dizzy. "How long was I in there anyway? It took everything I had to just survive; I<br/>couldn't sense the passage of time."<p>"Well, Nabiki has seemed a lot more cheerful at school for the past three days, so I guess<br/>that's how long you've been in there. She tried to post you to Antarctica..."<p>Happosai shuddered. "It must be the guiding hand of fate that returned me here! I don't<br/>want to go back to the Tendou dump, how about we forget why you were mad at me and<br/>I stay here again?"<p>Ranko shrugged. "I guess you've been punished enough, and maybe I was a little hard on<br/>you..." In truth, she had actually started to miss the old letch. Her apartment was a little<br/>lonely with just herself. "Just remember that next time you beat up Ranma not to bring<br/>my name into it. It's just an extra complication I don't need."<p>"Deal." Happosai nodded eagerly before making his way to the cupboard under the sink<br/>and retrieving a bunch of panties and bras to rub all over his face. "Why is it every time I<br/>leave the house for a few days you always hide my collection?"<p>Ranko pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. "Because this tiny place is cluttered<br/>enough without having to trip over stolen underwear all the time," she pointed out.<p>"I did say we could move into a bigger house to have enough room for my collection,<br/>and maybe you could finally start building up your own...?" he trailed off, a hopeful note<br/>in his voice.<p>"I'm not gonna start stealin' other girls underwear!" she said hotly, before adding in a<br/>quieter voice, "Bad enough I have my own to deal with..."<p>Happosai looked a little disappointed, but decided not to press the issue. "Oh well,<br/>maybe once Ranma accepts me as his master he'll start liberating silky darlings with me.<br/>I do need someone to pass on the higher secrets of Anything Goes onto..."<p>Ranko refused to rise to the bait, knowing full well that the 'higher secrets' were not<br/>invincible martial arts techniques, just different ways of stealing underwear. "Speaking<br/>of Ranma, he wants me to train him to improve his speed so he can defeat you."<p>"Pshaw!" Happosai snorted dismissively. "It'll take more than being faster for that young<br/>pup to beat this old dog. You're already faster, stronger and more skilled than him and<br/>you can't beat me."<p>Ranko gave him a half hearted glare. "If I weren't so hung over I'd kick your ass, old<br/>man."<p>Happosai gave her a condescending look. "You might be hung over, but I've never been<br/>as weak as this for years. Now you have to ask yourself, does your tiny little<br/>disadvantage carry enough weight to cancel out my huge disadvantage? Part of martial<br/>arts is about making these judgements before a fight."<p>"You lookin' for a beatin', Gramps?" Ranko balled a fist and waved it threateningly at<br/>him.<p>"If you can beat me, I'll teach you a powerful chi attack!" the old man chortled as he<br/>hopped onto the window ledge.<p>Ranko didn't need to hear anything else as she lifted a leg to rinse it under the sink tap,<br/>before repeating the process with the other to cleanse them of vomit. Then she darted into<br/>her room to change out of her Doraemon pajamas and emerge a moment later dressed in<br/>her fighting clothes. "Let's take this outside," she smirked coolly. The adrenaline rush<br/>brought on by the prospect of a new technique was already flushing her system and<br/>removing the effects of last night's drinking binge.<p>***<p>School went by fairly quickly for Ranko that day. Mainly because she slept right through<br/>it.<p>Abruptly, her head snapped up from her desk, startling several of the students around<br/>her. Two seconds later, the chime announcing lunchtime sounded. For a moment she<br/>looked pleased with herself, glad that her biological clock was on time, but her<br/>expression quickly changed to frustration as she recalled that she hadn't packed a lunch<br/>today. She hadn't even felt like going to school at all, but decided at the last minute to go<br/>since she'd missed most of last week. Besides which, she didn't really want to spend the<br/>day with Happosai after recieving such a savage beating from him that morning. It<br/>seemed like being weakened only made the little pervert stop pulling his punches...<p>"Hey, Ranko." a nudge from the desk next to her alerted her to Ranma's presence. "You<br/>alright? You've been sleeping all day," he said that with a slight note of envy in his voice.<br/>"Did things go okay last night? Pop was actin' kinda funny this morning..."<p>Ranko focused her attention on him as she considered her response. "I can't really<br/>remember much of last night. The old man got me so drunk I don't know what<br/>happened." She considered mentioning being shot in order to play on his sympathies, but<br/>considering she had only been shot as a result of a stupid mistake, she really didn't want<br/>to advertise that fact...<p>Any response from Ranma was interrupted by Nabiki Tendou running into the room and<br/>waving a newspaper. Her attention swiftly gravitated to the redhead by the window and<br/>she approached. "Ranko-san! Is this article true?"<p>Article? In a newspaper? Ranko suddenly developed a horrible sinking feeling. Had she<br/>done something newsworthy while drunk last night? A brief vision of herself charging<br/>naked through Tokyo while shooting off Mouko Takabishas and Hiryu Shouten Has<br/>every which way flashed before her eyes. With some effort, she shook it off. "I think I'd<br/>remember doin' *that*," she whispered before looking up at Nabiki. "What article?"<p>"It says you crippled two guys, injured two others, and got shot. Last night."<p>Ranko sighed in relief. At least she remembered this. "Ah, the Yakuza. Yeah, they were<br/>making trouble, so I took them down."<p>"You were shot?" Ranma cried out in a panicky voice before examining her more<br/>closely. "Where?"<p>"It only grazed me," Ranko mumbled while blushing severely. She rolled up her sleeve to<br/>show the fading pink line from the bullet's passage over her skin. "Wouldn'ta hit me at all<br/>if I hadn't been tryin' ta show off..."<p>"No way that's from last night. It's almost completely faded." said Sayuri, who had<br/>shown up along with a bunch of other students around Ranko's desk after hearing Nabiki<br/>describe the article.<p>"Whoo! Show us some more skin!" yelled one foolish boy, who had already forgotten the<br/>part of the article which said the cute redhead in front of him had crippled two men.<p>"I'm a martial artist. We heal fast," Ranko said, focusing entirely on Sayuri even as she<br/>absently applied a pain hold to the wrist of the unfortunate boy who had last spoken,<br/>letting go after only a few seconds, but still enough to bring tears to his eyes.<p>"You crippled two people last night! What kind of martial artist does that?" Akane yelled<br/>incredulously from across the classroom, having remained in her seat even as everyone<br/>else had crowded around Ranko.<p>"They were Yakuza, Akane. They had guns and were just about to use them," Ranko<br/>replied calmly. "In that kind of situation it's best to take them down hard and fast, not<br/>worry about being gentle."<p>"Wow! It says here one guy had his hand blown off!" Hiroshi exclaimed over Nabiki's<br/>shoulder.<p>"It wasn't blown off!" Ranko said in an exasparated tone. "His gun exploded and<br/>bloodied him up a bit, but his hand was still attached last I saw. It should have exploded<br/>straight away, but only did after the gun fired once..." she indicated her grazed arm and<br/>gave a self disparaging snort.<p>"Why would the gun explode?" asked a slightly subdued Nabiki.<p>"Because I threw a chopstick into the barrel. I saw it in a movie once, but it didn't work<br/>like in the movie..." Ranko explained shamefacedly.<p>"I'll say!" Ranma said condescendingly. "There's a million better ways to disarm a guy<br/>than tryin' some fancy pants trick like that."<p>"I know... it was a dumb thing to do, I just got too cocky." Ranko replied quietly.<p>"No way you could throw a chopstick to accurately go down a gun barrel!" Yuka<br/>exclaimed doubtfully.<p>Ranko cocked an eyebrow at her and picked up her pencil. "See that mechanical pencil<br/>sharpener on the teachers' desk?" Yuka nodded, and Ranko proceeded to flick her pencil<br/>so it landed firmly wedged inside the device.<p>Most of the students made suitably impressed noises, though both Ranma and Akane<br/>were heard to remark in stereo "I could do that."<p>Challenged to prove it by their dubious classmates, Ranma just shrugged and repeated<br/>Ranko's feat, splitting her pencil down the middle as his own became stuck in the pencil<br/>sharpener, which earned him an approving grin from the redhead in the seat next to his.<p>Then Akane haughtily rose from her seat and made her way to stand between Ranko and<br/>Ranma to get a clear shot at the teacher's desk. "Now watch this!" she said, before<br/>emitting a wordless battle-cry and hurling her pencil with all her might, which flew<br/>nearly two feet above the pencil sharpener and embedded itself halfway into the<br/>blackboard.<p>Akane blushed and mumbled something unintelligible as she slunk back to her seat<br/>amidst the laughter of her classmates.<p>Seeing this, Ranko felt a pang of sympathy for the girl who had never been her fiancee in<br/>this life. Standing up, she made her way over to Akane's desk and coughed to get the<br/>brooding girl's attention.<p>"What do *you* want?" Akane asked acidly, only doing a passable job of covering her<br/>depression with anger.<p>Ranko fidgeted slightly. Akane was only fun to tease because she reacted in such an over<br/>the top manner, but the Akane in this world seemed to be becoming more and more<br/>depressed and withdrawn with each passing day. It sucked the fun right out of the<br/>exercise to see Akane was really hurting rather than just blowing off steam. "Ah... it's not<br/>that hard, really. I could probably teach you how to do it over lunch...?"<p>"Why would you help me?" Akane queried. Her tone had softened, but there was definite<br/>mistrust in her voice.<p>Right, no one ever does somethin' for nuthin', Ranko thought, remembering all the times<br/>she had been screwed over by a 'free' gift from someone with an agenda. "Well..." she<br/>drew the word out while twirling her toes on the ground and adopting a cute expression.<br/>"It just so happens that I forgot to make my lunch this morning, and everyone knows<br/>what a great bento your big sister packs..."<p>"So you just want to steal my lunch, is that it?"<p>Ranko fought to keep her tone light and friendly. "Look, I was just thinking that maybe I<br/>could do something nice for you. We don't have to hate each other, Akane," there was a<br/>faint note of pleading in her voice as she finished.<p>Akane frowned as she seemed to be considering Ranko's words. "You're not just<br/>pretending to be nice so you can make fun of me?"<p>Ranko paused. Akane seemed so vulnerable it was almost painful to watch. What had<br/>happened to her fiery, uncute tomboy who didn't take any crap? She wanted Akane back<br/>to her old self, so she could tease her without feeling guilty, but she wasn't planning on<br/>making fun of Akane in the immediate future. "No, I'm not," she said simply, giving a<br/>mental promise not to taunt Akane at all... at least for the rest of the day.<p>Akane looked thoughtful for a moment before taking out her lunchbox and pushing it<br/>halfway across the desk towards Ranko. "Then I guess you can show me how to do your<br/>stupid throwing trick. Not that I really care."<p>Ranko's face lit up in a brilliant smile as she started to explain what Akane had been<br/>doing wrong with her throw, and guiding Akane through the motions of how to do it<br/>properly. Akane, for her part, seemed rather unenthusiastic at first, though Ranko's<br/>cheerfulness seemed to be infectious, and pretty soon Akane was smiling genuinely as<br/>she and Ranko tossed various small objects around the classroom with uncanny<br/>accuracy.<p>Ranma blinked in confusion at the scene the pair presented. "I thought those two hated<br/>each other?" he asked.<p>"I thought that too," Nabiki said as she studied them. Akane had been building up a lot<br/>of anger towards Ranko in recent weeks, yet there was no sign of it here. Either Akane<br/>was a better actress than Nabiki had given her credit for, or there was something deeper<br/>going on. Also, there was something... off... in the way Ranko was behaving with Akane<br/>right now. Nabiki couldn't quite put her finger on what it was, but it was nagging at the<br/>back of her mind.<p>Ranma looked up at Nabiki, who had apparently spaced out, and sighed. "I'll never<br/>understand girls."<p>***
