</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 15<p>Ranma staggered into his home, barely supporting his weight on a thick branch he had<br/>broken off a tree upon the termination of his impromtu flight over Nerima. "I'm home." he<br/>called out weakly while kicking off his shoes and dropping his schoolbag in the genkan.<p>"Welcome home, son. How was - oh my!" Nodoka had stepped into the hallway and was<br/>now taking in Ranma's dishevelled appearance with a healthy amount of shock. "I just<br/>bought that uniform yesterday!" the Saotome matriarch wailed as she dashed over and<br/>started dusting her son off, examining the numerous tears and stains on the fabric of Ranma's<br/>school clothes.<p>"Heh... don' worry... mom... I'm fine..." Ranma slurred out before collapsing in her arms.<br/>This was of course Genma's cue to appear and start bemoaning his fate of having such a<br/>weak son.<p>"Boy! What happened to put you in this state?" Genma grabbed Ranma away from Nodoka<br/>and started shaking him roughly. "Your weakness is a shame against the Anything Goes<br/>school!"<p>"What the hell are ya talkin' about old man? It was your stupid master that did this to me!"<br/>Ranma shot back, seeming to regain most of his energy as he broke Genma's hold and glared<br/>fiercely at his father.<p>"What?" Genma roared "You angered the Master? Foolish boy, what were you thinking?"<p>Ranma snorted dismissively. "That old freak ain't no master of mine!" he said while making<br/>a contemptous gesture. "I'll find a way to beat him, just you wait!"<p>"Son, you shouldn't be fighting Happosai-sensei, he's only a harmless little old man."<br/>Nodoka fretted while wringing her hands.<p>Both Saotome males paused to give Nodoka an odd look. "Yes... of course, dear..." Genma<br/>said hesitantly before swinging an arm over his son's shoulder "The boy and I need to talk,<br/>martial arts stuff, you understand?"<p>"Oh of course!" Nodoka nodded brightly. "I'll just get started on dinner while you impart<br/>your wisdom to our son!" and with that she puttered off to the kitchen.<p>"Feh, maybe we should tell her about the Neko-ken sometime, huh pop?" Ranma remarked,<br/>disgusted by the amount of trust and faith his mother had in his worthless father.<p>"Er... let's not and say we did, eh son?" Genma laughed nervously before his glasses glinted<br/>in the light and he adopted a sollemn expression. "Now boy, you need to forget those fool<br/>ideas about taking on the Master. There is but one," here Genma held up his index finger<br/>"technique which can be used against him. Tendou and I have used it to defeat even his most<br/>powerful rages."<p>Now Ranma was interested. "Wow, must be some technique, what is it?"<p>"The Crouch of the Wild Tiger. I will only demonstrate this once boy, so pay attention."<br/>Genma barked sternly before kneeling down, seeing he had Ranma's attention he then bowed<br/>forward so his head was touching the ground and started babbling "I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm<br/>sorry!"<p>"I hate you, pop." Ranma muttered in disgust as he left the pathetic kowtowing figure and<br/>went to get cleaned up before dinner, resolutely swearing that he would find a technique or<br/>training method to bring him up to Happosai's level.<p>***<p>At the Kuno mansion, a certain Kodachi Kuno was in high spirits as she worked on mixing<br/>certain plant extracts in her greenhouse. The vapours being given off were the main reason<br/>for her giddiness, but there was also the matter of what she had slipped in her brother's<br/>dinner earlier. Though she wasn't sure if he would even notice, since Kodachi was rather<br/>certain that Tatewaki wasn't sexually active. Still, it should keep him from having any<br/>naughty thoughts about her friend.<p>"Foul twisted wench of a sister!" A commanding voice thundered from the door linking the<br/>greenhouse with the mansion proper.<p>Kodachi let loose a burst of her blood curdling laughter, demurely covering her mouth as a<br/>lady should. "Whatever brings you to my humble presence, dearest brother mine?" She<br/>asked sarcasticly.<p>"Spare me thy pretensions of innocence, evil harpy that only yet lives due to the twisted<br/>mockery of Heaven's law that makes you share my of my noble blood!" Kuno roared angrily<br/>while waving his bokken around. "Pray tell what foul concotion has affected the Blue<br/>Thunder's almighty puissance? For it came to pass that when I admired my images of the<br/>wondrous Akane Tendou and sought to commence meditating upon her beauty that my flesh<br/>was unwilling to respond to the call! Such an affront stinks of your malevolence, sinister<br/>sister of mine!"<p>Kodachi took a moment to parse that speech before she realised what Tatewaki was<br/>effectively saying. She wrinkled her nose before yelling "Brother, that's disgusting!"<p>***<p>It was lunchtime the following day and Ranma had staked out the same spot he had shared<br/>lunch with Ranko the day before, and was looking forward to actually trying Kasumi's lunch<br/>this time without it being stolen by his other fiancee.<p>"Hiya Ranma-kun! Mind if I join you?" a friendly voice intruded on his ruminations on<br/>lunch food.<p>Ranma looked up to see one of Kasumi's sisters looking down at him, bento box in hand and<br/>a smile on her face. "Sure thing, Nabiki-san. Take a seat." He patted the ground next to him.<p>"Now, now." Nabiki admonished, waggling a finger at him. "You could become my brother<br/>in law, there's no need to be so formal."<p>"Okay, Nabiki-chan." Ranma nodded, smiling at her.<p>Nabiki smirked. "Hardly anyone calls me Nabiki-chan." she observed before proceeding to<br/>kneel down and open her lunchbox before speaking again. "What was all that about this<br/>morning with you fighting Kuno and that other boy picking a fight with you as well?"<p>Ranma groaned at the memory of his old rival swearing to 'destroy his happiness'. "That guy<br/>was Ryouga Hibiki, I used to go to school with him. He always got all pissed because I was<br/>able to get the last bread in the school cafeteria when he was trying to get it. He always made<br/>some big production out of 'Never forgiving the offense of the curry bread!'" Ranma said,<br/>imitating Ryouga's usual angry tones before continuing in his normal voice. "He challenged<br/>me to a duel about it, but the loudmouth coward never actually showed up. Dunno what's<br/>got him all worked up now, but if he wants a fight I'll be happy to give him one."<p>"Uh huh... and what about what you did to Kuno?" Nabiki prodded insistently.<p>Ranma's expression hardened noticeably. "He had it coming."<p>"Wow, you've just met the guy and you've got him pegged!" Nabiki sniggered before<br/>noticing just how angry Ranma looked. "Geez, what did he do?"<p>"He tried to get Ranko to sleep with him after saying all those horrible things about her<br/>yesterday." Ranma got out while gritting his teeth, he hated hypocritical bastards like that<br/>Kuno guy.<p>Nabiki exhaled sharply, blowing up her bangs in the process. "Wow, and here I thought he<br/>was in love with Akane..."<p>"Feh, he's just a scumbag, I doubt he knows what love is." Ranma snorted derisively.<p>"Probably not." Nabiki mused. "Speaking of Ranko-san, where is she today?"<p>"She went off on a trainin' trip, dunno when she'll be back but it should be in a few days.<br/>Heck, I should be goin' on a training trip myself so I can learn some way to beat that old<br/>freak, but mom says I need ta focus on school..." Ranma said, feeling a bit of respect for his<br/>fiancee, since he didn't know that many people his age who were serious enough about<br/>martial arts to skip school in order to practice.<p>"You mean Happosai?" Nabiki asked, her voice losing it's light tone as she scowled angrily.<br/>"If you're going after him then you've got my full support."<p>"What'd he do to you?" Ranma asked, raising an eyebrow at the display of temper.<p>"Never you mind." Nabiki growled. "Just know that if you ever need any help dealing with<br/>the wretched little pervert you can count on me."<p>"Um... you're not really a martial artist, so I doubt you could help with this..." Ranma said<br/>hesitantly, not wanting to offend her but still feeling the need to raise the point.<p>Nabiki deflated a bit. "That's true, but my offer still stands. I really want to hurt that old<br/>letch..."<p>"Hold! Vile knave, I see thou art keeping the company of the mercenary Nabiki Tendou, no<br/>doubt she helped orchestrate my downfall at the hands of your black sorcery this morn, but<br/>know that the scion of Kuno shall never admit defeat to the likes of you, have at thee fiend!"<p>Ranma stood up and cracked his knuckles. "Back for more? That's just fine with me..." He<br/>had no objection to pounding this mouthy asshole twice in one day. As he leapt to meet<br/>Kuno's charge, he wondered just how Ranko was doing on her training trip and if she was<br/>having more fun than him.<p>***<p>Ranma-chan cheerfully walked through the streets of Shinjuku, reveling in the feeling of<br/>wearing her normal male clothing, the unrestrained bouncing of her breasts with each step<br/>(actually that hurt a little, but she was a martial artist so she could take it), the liberated<br/>feeling of wearing boxers instead of panties (thankfully her period was last week, otherwise<br/>she'd have to wear panties to hold the pad - she refused to use tampons since the idea of<br/>putting something up 'there' was just disgusting to her) and having her hair in a simple and<br/>economical pigtail rather than falling loose down her back, which looked good but was a<br/>hassle to look after.<p>All in all, she was quite content with her decision to get away from Nerima and the pressures<br/>of being Ranko for just a little while. Of course, she'd have to go back and assume that role<br/>once more if she ever wanted to really regain her true identity, but right now she needed a<br/>break before she snapped.<p>Spotting a dojo, she decided to go and challenge it, not to claim their sign or anything, just<br/>for fun and to maybe pick up a technique or two if they were any good - obviously there was<br/>no chance of her losing, but maybe they could hold her interest for a little bit.<p>She was just approaching the entrance when a tall boy dressed in a black vest and fatigues<br/>with a white bandanna on his head exited. The boy struck what he no doubt thought of as a<br/>pose of righteous martial contemplation and began mumbling to himself. "That dojo was no<br/>challenge... I can feel my mastery over the techniques becoming closer... if I can only find<br/>the other school I'll be able to rebuild the dojo..."<p>Ranma-chan grinned cruelly. Here was an imposter she could get away with beating up, and<br/>she had never liked the guy anyway, especially for playing with her mother's head the way<br/>he had. "Did you just defeat that dojo?" She asked him.<p>"Huh? Yeah I did." The boy smirked at her, no doubt imagining she was awestruck by his<br/>manly prowess.<p>"Really? What's your name?" Ranma-chan pressed on.<p>"Ranma Saotome."<p>"Really?" Ranma-chan cracked her knuckles in anticipation.<p>***<p>"Wow, just from air pressure!" Nabiki commented as the statue she was taking shelter by<br/>was destroyed by Kuno's rapid strike attack despite being several metres away.<p>Ranma was dodging Kuno's strikes with careless ease, although it looked to Nabiki like he<br/>was purposely putting himself in range of Kuno's attacks without counterattacking. That<br/>struck her as odd, since when Ranma had fought Kuno in the morning he had been much<br/>more offensive and had overwhelmed Kuno within seconds.<p>"Stand still and let me thrash you, knave!" Kuno roared, increasing the intensity of his<br/>attacks so much that small rips were appearing all over Ranma's school uniform.<p>"Come on, Kuno! I know you can do better than that!" Ranma taunted as he continued<br/>weaving around the sword strikes and air pressure blasts, only taking superficial damage in<br/>the process.<p>Nabiki wondered just what Ranma was doing, since even with the speed of Kuno's attack,<br/>even she could tell he was relatively open, so why wasn't Ranma finishing him?<p>***<p>Ranma-chan lazily flipped over the single vacum blade her opponent had sent at her. It<br/>seemed Ryu had yet to fully master the Kijin Raishu Dan and was showing visible exertion<br/>just from launching a single one of the deadly projectiles. At this rate I won't even have to<br/>use the Umisenken... she kept that thought to herself though, since revealing her knowledge<br/>of that school probably would result in him pestering her no end for its secrets.<p>"You dodged my vacum blade? Looks like I'll have to go all out." Ryu Kumon said,<br/>impressed at her agility.<p>"Feh! Get real, that was your best attack wasn't it?" Ranma-chan shot back, seeing right<br/>through his bluster.<p>Ryu flinched, but quickly recovered and advanced once more, yelling "Don't move!" before<br/>leaping to attack. Ranma-chan involuntarily stiffened, allowing him to get within her guard<br/>and push past her arms, landing a brutal kick to her sternum while calling out "Mouko<br/>Kaimon Ha!"<p>Ranma-chan tumbled backwards, and quickly got to her feet to avoid his follow up strike.<br/>"Heh, not bad." she admitted before smirking confidently. "Now face my fierce tiger. Mouko<br/>Takabisha!" she a wide blast of confidence chi, that he had no chance of dodging at this<br/>range, straight at him, easily bowling him over.<p>Athough she could have won in a single blow right at the beginning with her shiatsu<br/>knowledge combined with the speed of the Parlay du Foie Gras. That speed that was<br/>normally useless in a fight since it sacrificed almost all power, but if she used that speed to<br/>just tap a few pressure points she could defeat anyone with a minimum of fuss. But where<br/>was the fun in that? So instead of finishing him before he recovered, Ranma-chan waited for<br/>Kumon to regain his footing before resuming the battle.<p>***<p>This isn't working, Ranma thought as he dodged Kuno's blows. Although the kendoist was<br/>striking fast, he was using a rigid pattern which Ranma had already figured out, hence<br/>Ranma wasn't really having to exert himself to dodge.<p>He had thought he could take advantage of Kuno's speed strike technique to get practice<br/>against a fast opponent, but the kendoist was light years behind Happosai in both speed and<br/>skill. What Ranma needed was to face something both fast and unpredictable if he wanted to<br/>improve his speed to reach Happosai's level, his own subconscious fighting instincts were<br/>working against him with Kuno.<p>Sighing, he decided to wrap things up, and weaved inside Kuno's guard, knocking him out<br/>with several quick strikes. "That was a waste of time." he commented, sparing a disparaging<br/>glance to his beaten foe.<p>"Why did you toy with him for so long?" Nabiki asked, stepping over towards him.<p>"I thought dodging his speed attack would be good practice for Happosai, but he's so<br/>predictable it wasn't any help." Ranma lamented.<p>"You need to get faster to deal with him, huh?"<p>"Yep." Ranma nodded. "The little bastard is inhumanly fast, it's like I'm movin' in slow<br/>motion next to him..." he sighed heavily "I need to figure some kind of training exercise<br/>that'll help boost my speed."<p>"Speed, huh? Why don't you ask Ranko? I've seen her move pretty fast from time to time."<br/>Nabiki offered helpfully.<p>Ranma shook his head. "Nah, she's good for a girl, but I doubt she'd know anything really<br/>useful."<p>***<p>Ranma-chan smirked at the beaten and unconscious form of Ryu Kumon on the steps of the<br/>Tanaka dojo while ignoring the dojo owner who had come out and was yelling about the<br/>huge amount of property damage their fight had caused.<p>"Ranma Saotome doesn't lose, and you ain't him buddy."<p>***
