</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>by Ebiris ()<p>Chapter 16<p>Ranko strolled through Shibuya, heading towards the train station so she could return to<br/>Nerima. The past few days wandering around Tokyo had been a pleasant diversion from<br/>her life as Ranko Xiawang, but had done little to reaffirm her identity as Ranma<br/>Saotome.<p>Her life as Ranma Saotome was mostly defined by the people she interacted with. The<br/>rivals and fiancee's first and foremost among them, but aside from the all too brief battle<br/>with Ryu Kumon, she had been sorely lacking in both categories.<p>She was jolted out of her thoughts upon seeing a mailbox rush past her. A mailbox?<br/>Curiousity piqued, she followed the ambulatory postage receptacle until it entered a<br/>small restauraunt, the banner outside reading 'Kuonji's Okonomiyaki'. Shouting voices<br/>were heard coming from within, quickly followed by sounds of violence before the<br/>mailbox came flying out the door, the head of what an uniformed person would call a girl<br/>was now visible poking out of the mailbox as well.<p>In an instant the redhead's face lit up into a brilliant smile. "Ucchan!" she exclaimed<br/>joyfully, deciding that she could catch a later train as she dashed into the restauraunt.<p>Sure enough, there stood Ukyo Kuonji behind the grill, big-ass spatula in hand and<br/>breathing heavily with ill concealed rage. Sadly Ukyo was in her bishonen male<br/>crossdressing guise and had her breasts strapped down, otherwise said heavy breathing<br/>would have been significantly more entertaining.<p>Seeing a customer enter, Ukyo tried to get her anger under control enough to give a<br/>friendly greeting. "Welcome to Kuonji's. What can I get you?"<p>"I'll have the special, please." Ranko replied, taking a seat at the counter.<p>"One special for the pretty lady, coming right up!" Ukyo winked at her before starting to<br/>mix ingredients into the batter for cooking, seeming to be in a better mood now.<p>"None of that now, I'm an engaged woman." Ranko said reprovingly, but with a smile on<br/>her face to show she wasn't offended.<p>"Oh well, can't blame a guy for trying, right?" Ukyo said cheerfully, although Ranko<br/>could tell she was visibly relieved and trying not to show it.<p>Deciding not to make an issue of it, Ranko inhaled deeply of the aromas, realising just<br/>how much she missed Ucchan's okonomiyaki - to say nothing of missing her best friend.<br/>"Mmmm, smells delicious!" She enthused.<p>"Heh, best in all of Japan." Ukyo said proudly while flipping over the partially cooked<br/>okonomiyaki before giving Ranko an appraising eye. "Say, I don't recall seeing you<br/>around before, you new in town?"<p>Ranko shook her head. "Just visiting, I live over in Nerima." she said before<br/>remembering that she hadn't introduced herself yet. "I'm Ranko Xiawang." she added.<p>Ukyo nodded. "Pleased to meet you, Ranko-san. Like the sign on the door says, I'm<br/>Ukyo Kuonji."<p>"Hey, just call me Ranko-chan." Ranko suggested. It wasn't quite the same as 'Ranchan'<br/>but given that Ukyo was still looking for vengeance on her childhood friend, she decided<br/>that suggesting that would be a bad idea.<p>"Sure thing, Ranko-chan. Your special is ready." Ukyo defly flipped the okonomiyaki<br/>from the grill onto her customer's plate.<p>"Thanks!" Ranko handed over a thousand yen note before gleefully tearing into the food.<br/>"Slow day, huh?" She asked, looking around the otherwise empty shop.<p>Ukyo shrugged. "The lunch crowd'll be here in an hour or so. I just had to deal with one<br/>annoying pest right before you came in, otherwise yeah it's been pretty quiet."<p>The two began talking about inconsequential things, though with Ranko knowing what<br/>buttons to push, Ukyo swiftly opened up and the pair were soon chatting away like long<br/>lost friends. Ranko related some of her martial arts adventures while Ukyo talked about<br/>her training against the raging sea - though the chef was tight-lipped on the reason for her<br/>training.<p>Ranko thought it was nice. With no romantic tension they were able to just talk like they<br/>did as children without Ukyo having to constantly push herself as the 'cute fiancee'.<p>Several okonomiyaki later and the restauraunt was starting to fill up, making Ranko<br/>decide to leave and let her friend work without distraction. Giving a fond farewell, the<br/>short redhead stepped out onto the street and barely avoided being knocked over by a boy<br/>about her age.<p>"Oh, I'm sorry miss." The fanged boy in dusty travelling clothes apologised before seeing<br/>he had her attention. "I'm terribly sorry, but I don't suppose you know how to get to<br/>Furinkan High School?"<p>Ranko sighed miserably. Nothing like a lost idiot to ruin her good mood. "Yeah, I'm<br/>headed that way myself, come with me." With any luck once they got to Nerima he'd fall<br/>in love with Akane or something and leave her and Ranma the hell alone.<p>***<p>"I don't think he's coming, Ranma-kun." Nabiki said to the pigtailed boy who was<br/>standing in the middle of the Furinkan High sports field.<p>Ranma shrugged. "I figured as much, that's why I told Kasumi not to bother coming<br/>since she wouldn't get to see any fight anyway. Knowin' Ryouga he probably won't show<br/>for a week or so."<p>"I see." Nabiki said in a dry tone. A few minutes later she spoke again. "If he's not going<br/>to come then why are you waiting here?"<p>Ranma looked at her incredulously. "Because as soon as I leave he'll probably appear<br/>and start going on about how I'm a coward for 'running away'. I'll wait for an hour or so<br/>here every day, until he does turn up, then I'll beat the crap out of him so he can stop<br/>bothering me with his lame challenges."<p>"It's good to see you take the challenges of a martial artist so seriously." A wizened old<br/>voice came from between the two teenagers.<p>"Old freak!" "Little bastard!" Ranma and Nabiki both yelled, leaping away from<br/>Happosai who had somehow appeared at their feet.<p>Happosai ignored their insults and addressed Ranma. "So, Ranma m'boy, have you given<br/>any more thought to being my official student?"<p>Ranma took a defensive stance, wishing he'd had more time to practice speed drills<br/>before going up against the evil little gnome again, but unwilling to back down like his<br/>pathetic father would. "Like hell, old man!" He spat angrily.<p>Happosai tutted sadly. "Oh well, even if you won't become my student, they say pain is<br/>the best teacher of all." he turned to Nabiki and leered at her. "You might want to step<br/>away from the fight, Nabiki-chan."<p>Nabiki backed off, fixing Happosai with a glare that would have wilted a lesser man.<br/>Alas Happosai was long used to such reactions, and just smiled wider before waving a<br/>pair of panties at her. Nabiki recognised those panties and swiftly jammed her knees<br/>together, seeming to almost glow with fury. "Kill him, Ranma!" She screamed, waving a<br/>fist angrily.<p>And thus the battle was joined.<p>***<p>Ranko sighed heavily, absolutely sick of trying to guide Ryouga so he wouldn't get lost.<br/>She had made sure to insult him repeatedly so he wouldn't get any silly ideas about<br/>falling in love with her, but unlike when she was Ranma and insulted his sense of<br/>direction, he just smiled goofily and corrected his course. She had a sinking suspicion<br/>that it was too late, the pathetic fool just imprinted on any female who showed him a<br/>minimum of kindness, and in spite of her insults she had guided him and even taken his<br/>hand a few times. She'd even paid his train fare when he couldn't find his wallet. In short,<br/>she was doomed.<p>"No, your *other* left, retard!" She snapped at him as he started in the wrong direction at<br/>what was thankfully the last junction before Furinkan.<p>"Ah heh, sorry about that Ranko-san, I don't know what I was thinking." Ryouga<br/>chuckled nervously and changed his direction.<p>Ranko just grumbled profanities under her breath, almost wishing a freak rainstorm<br/>would activate his curse so she could ditch the loser.<p>A few minutes later they finally reached their destination. "Here we are, Furinkan...<br/>What the hell?" She exclaimed, seeing what looked like a Ranma, twisted into a pretzel<br/>shape in the middle of the sports field with Nabiki and Akane trying to put his limbs<br/>back in their original positions.<p>"Ranma!" She ran over to her injured fiance and knelt before him. "What happened to<br/>you?" She refused to believe Kuno could have possibly done this, and besides, none of<br/>the injuries looked like they were caused by a bokken.<p>"Happosai happened to him." Nabiki said after all that came from Ranma was a series of<br/>pained groans.<p>"Happosai? What the hell did he attack you for?" Ranko questioned insistently.<p>Nabiki shrugged. "Something about wanting Ranma to recognise him as his master."<p>Ranma managed to recover enough to speak coherently at this point and added "He said<br/>I wasn't worthy of you. Ha! Stupid old man don't know what he's talkin' about, I never<br/>asked for this engagement."<p>"Does that mean you're marrying Kasumi?" Akane inquired curiously.<p>"I never asked for that one neither!" Ranma retorted bitterly.<p>"Jerk!" Akane sniffed before storming off.<p>Meanwhile, Ranko was positively fuming at this new impediment to her plans. "That<br/>asshole! I give him a home, I feed him, I'm probably the only person on earth that treats<br/>him nicely and this is how he repays me? I'm gonna kick his tiny little ass all the way to<br/>China!"<p>Ranma was about to point out that Ranko wouldn't stand a chance in hell against<br/>Happosai when someone else bellowed "Ranma! Prepare to die!" And lunged at him with<br/>a lead weighted umbrella.<p>"What the hell do you think you're doing, moron?" Ranko yelled, intercepting and<br/>stopping Ryouga's strike with a single hand. "You can't attack him when he's injured like<br/>this!"<p>Ryouga blinked in surprise at having his attack blocked with so little effort by such a<br/>petite girl. Then he recovered and sneered. "Hiding behind a girl, Ranma? That's low<br/>even for you."<p>"Hey! I didn't ask her to!" Ranma shot back, before getting a calculating glint in his eyes.<br/>"Besides, if you can't even beat a little girl, what chance do you have against me?"<p>"What? How dare you imply that I would even try to fight a defenceless girl! Unlike<br/>you I have honour!" Ryouga yelled furiously.<p>"Defenceless? Little?" Ranko repeated in a quiet voice, her left eyebrow twitching<br/>furiously.<p>Noticing that the metal head of the umbrella was starting to warp where Ranko was<br/>grasping it, Nabiki started edging away and trying to look inconspicous.<p>"This is a battle between men, you coward! Fight me!" Ryouga yelled, trying to wave his<br/>umbrella threateningly at Ranma but finding it completely immobile in Ranko's grip.<p>With a series of gruesome popping and crunching noises that made all observers wince,<br/>Ranma managed to extricate himself from being contorted in the shape of a pretzel.<br/>Standing up woozily, he motioned for Ranko to move. "Out of the way Ranko. It's like<br/>he said, I gotta fight him."<p>"Like hell, Saotome, you're in no shape to fight. Even Akane could take you now."<br/>Ranko said, turning to face him but retaining her hold on Ryouga's umbrella.<p>"Hey!" An outraged feminine voice came from the watching crowd of Furinkan students.<p>"No, he wanted a fight and I'm gonna give him one." Ranma said determinedly.<p>"Dammit, I'm trying to do you a favour, what the hell's wrong with you?" Ranko yelled,<br/>thinking of all the times she'd had to put up with Ryouga's constant attacks and wishing<br/>the lost boy would just piss off and leave her alone. Sure, fighting him was sometimes<br/>fun, but a lot of the time it was annoying as hell.<p>Ranma started to move around his fiancee, but Ranko shifted to keep herself between the<br/>two combatants. She could feel her patience with this so called 'Ranma' was fraying<br/>rapidly. Why didn't he just do what was good for him? Did he want to get his ass kicked<br/>by a loser like Ryouga? He should be in hospital, not trying to act like a badass by<br/>pretending he wasn't badly hurt.<p>Her battle aura started to fitfully manifest in the visible spectrum from lack of control. If<br/>neither of them backed down she would force them down. It would be easy for her, not<br/>even Ryouga could match her strength right now and her speed was unmatched by<br/>anyone even in her old life. She could crush them utterly and it wouldn't matter. Ryouga<br/>always pissed her off with his pointless attacks and sniping at her relationship with<br/>Akane, but this wasn't her Ryouga. She could cripple or kill him with ease and it<br/>wouldn't matter in the real world! And Ranma? She was Ranma, this imposter was<br/>nothing! She could kill him and take her life back from the fraud! She could... She<br/>could...<p>She could look into those grey eyes, burning with familiar determination. The<br/>determination to win, to never back down from a fight. Could that really be faked? Was<br/>he really just an imitation?<p>Ranko's anger guttered out like a candle in the wind and she silently berated herself for<br/>coming so close to losing control. She was starting to act like some stupid overemotional<br/>angry tomboy, not a disciplined martial artist.<p>Giving one last chance at resolving things without a brutal and pointless defeat for<br/>Ranma, she pleaded with them. "Can't you just fight him tomorrow after you have a<br/>chance to recover? Fighting like this proves nothing! You can't decide who is better by<br/>fighting when one of you has such a disadvantage! Please?" She used a weapon far<br/>greater than any martial arts technique - the dreaded puppy dog eyes of a kawai girl.<p>They never stood a chance.<p>"Okay... I guess that's fine... but you better not run away again, Ranma!"<p>"Hey! I waited three days ya jerk!"<p>Ranko sighed. "Maybe you should put up your tent here so you won't get lost tomorrow,<br/>Ryouga."<p>"Wow! That's a great idea, Ranko-san, why didn't I think of that!" Ryouga said with<br/>distressing conviction.<p>Because you're a moron? Ranko thought, deciding to avoid saying that in case things<br/>blew up again.<p>"Because you're a moron?" Ranma asked sincerely, before wondering why Ranko was<br/>collapsing in hysterics. It wasn't that funny...<p>***
