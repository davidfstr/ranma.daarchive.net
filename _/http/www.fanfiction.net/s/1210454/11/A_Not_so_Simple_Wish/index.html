</div>Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan.<br/>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>Chapter 19<br/>by Ebiris<p>Ranko carefully schooled her features into an expression of neutrality as she surveyed<br/>her surroundings. A beef bowl shop. And a dirty one at that. Obviously Genma wasn't<br/>willing to even put the least bit effort into his wife's latest crazy plan, not that she could<br/>blame him for that. Still, it would have been nice to go someplace at least a little classier.<p>As the pair made their way to the counter, she did her best to ignore some of the lewd<br/>suggestions from the less savoury patrons as to what business a young girl such as herself<br/>would have with a fat middle aged guy like Genma. In truth it was nothing she hadn't<br/>heard before since getting the curse, but it still bothered her that people could see her that<br/>way.<p>They both sat at the counter and were greeted by the greasy haired proprieter of the<br/>establishment. "What can I get ya?" the man asked, his lips curled in half a sneer while<br/>he idly rubbed his hands on his apron, which only seemed to get them dirtier.<p>"I'll have the deluxe combination, with eggs." Genma said after a quick glance at the<br/>pricing board.<p>"Er... I'll just have a regular beef bowl," Ranko said, for the first time realising just how<br/>spoiled she was ever since the training trip had ended. At one time food from a dive like<br/>this would have been manna from heaven, but ever since living with the Tendous her<br/>standards had gone up quite a bit.<p>Wordlessly, the man scooped some beef into a bowl and plopped it down in front of<br/>Ranko, before assembling a small platter of various meats and giving it to Genma.<p>"So..." Genma opened the conversation. "You're still set on marrying the boy, eh?"<p>"Yes." Ranko bobbed her head up and down in agreement.<p>"What if I told you that he's an arrogant brat with no respect for his long suffering father<br/>who worked so hard to raise him?" Genma asked, finishing with a theatrical sob at the<br/>injustice of having such a worthless son.<p>"Uh... what does that have to do with me?" Ranko asked, his insults against Ranma (and<br/>by extension her) flowing over her like water off a duck's back since she was quite used<br/>to tuning out Genma's rants.<p>Genma blinked in confusion, as if he had somehow expected sympathy for all the<br/>sacrifices he had made in raising an unappreciative son. "Well, why would you want to<br/>marry a boy who has no respect for his own father?"<p>Ranko considered her response. It was incredibly tempting to just start insulting the fat,<br/>worthless panda, but did she really want to alienate him? Then again, who in the world<br/>ever really gave a shit what Genma Saotome thought about anything? "Maybe he just<br/>gives you the respect you deserve," she pointed out innocently, not even bothering to hide<br/>her smirk.<p>"If he did then he wouldn't be such a problem," Genma complained, seeming to<br/>completely miss her point. "Alright then," he gathered himself once more, seeming to<br/>prepare a different approach. "the boy's scared of cats! Do you really want to marry a<br/>man who's terrified of a little pussy?"<p>Ranko flinched at the feline reference, and managed to remain blissfully ignorant of the<br/>double entendre sailing right over her head. "I don't like cats either," she said in between<br/>grinding her teeth.<p>Genma snorted at that. "Even so, do you really want to spend your life with a man who<br/>panics at the slightest glimpse of a cat? Oh how I am shamed by my cowardly son!" The<br/>overweight martial artist began wailing at the indignity.<p>"So. It's not like cats are everywhere," Ranko said, even as she surreptitously glanced<br/>around in case any felines were hiding in the dark corners of the restaurant, waiting to<br/>attack the moment she let her guard down. Unconsciously, she shuddered.<p>Genma sighed, probably having expected her to have given up on his worthless son by<br/>now. "Time to bring out the big guns..." he whispered, apparently psyching himself up<br/>before whipping off his bandanna to expose his naked cranium to the world. "He'll be<br/>bald by the time he's thirty! No Saotome male has ever escaped this horrible curse!"<p>*That* got a reaction. "You're lying!" Ranko almost yelled, recoiling away from him and<br/>fingering her scarlet tresses protectively. She still remembered how close she had come to<br/>going bald from the Dragon's Whisker incident. She didn't give a stuff about the Ranma<br/>of *this* reality going bald, but it was certainly a fate she wished to avoid herself.<p>Genma gave her a mournful look as tears streamed down his face. "Would these eyes<br/>lie?" he asked while pointing to said orbs.<p>Ranko barely kept herself from responding with an emphatic yes as she tried to calm<br/>herself down. Future hair loss was the least of her worries, given her current wrong<br/>gender. Wracking her brain, she tried to recall all the stuff her pop had said in the past to<br/>excuse his baldness. "Um... isn't baldness a sign of virility?"<p>He gave her a hooded gaze. "I left my wife for ten years," he said simply, as if that<br/>explained everything.<p>Funnily enough it did.<p>Ranko's innocent naivete could no longer shield her from the harsh facts being thrown at<br/>her. "No! That's an even worse lie!" she screamed, half hysterical and covering her ears.<br/>"I can't hear you. I can't hear you!"<p>A few half-hearted murmers came from the other patrons encouraging her to pipe down,<br/>but no one seemed to really care.<p>"Calm down, girl," Genma shook her roughly. "It's not the end of the world, I'm sure you<br/>can find someone else to marry."<p>Ranko managed to calm herself just enough to respond in a coherent fashion. "No, no.<br/>That's alright, after all, I'm sure we can have plenty of children before he loses his hair<br/>and his... er, y'know..." Her voice held a strange edge to it as she spoke.<p>Genma let out a great big sigh of frustration, but before he could rally more arguments, a<br/>shout came from the door. "Hey! That's the guy!"<p>Both of them turned at the noise to see several men crowding the entryway. Genma<br/>immediately stiffened, and Ranko took a moment to analyse them before she too<br/>stiffened.<p>Each of the men was missing a single finger, and there were subtle bulges in their<br/>clothing which she recognised as being concealed firearms. They were Yakuza. They<br/>were pointing at Genma. They did not look happy.<p>The leader (Ranko identified him as such because he wore the most expensive clothes,<br/>although the tacky jewellery indicated he probably wasn't very high up in the overall<br/>chain of command) sauntered over to them while another casually made his way to cover<br/>the fire escape, leaving three more at the main entrance.<p>"Well, well, well. I never thought I'd see you again," the leader said to Genma, a shark's<br/>grin on his face. "Perhaps you'd like to step outside so we can... discuss... the money you<br/>stole from us." He took a moment to leer at Ranko, his gold tooth glinting harshly in the<br/>light. "Otherwise things might not go so well for you and your lady companion."<p>Genma stood to his full height, looming over the Yakuza and looking every inch the<br/>deadly martial artist he truly was. Gone was the fat buffoon that people were so familiar<br/>with, and in his place stood the Master of the Saotome School of Anything Goes martial<br/>arts. A man who knew of over a dozen ways to kill the fool before him with but a single<br/>strike. A man who could not help but command the fear and respect of those around him.<p>"I'm sorry! Take the girl, please! Just leave me alone!"<p>"Hey!" Ranko cried out in surprise at being grabbed and held in front of Genma like a<br/>human shield.<p>The Yakuza looked shocked for an instant, then sneered. "I'm not interested in your<br/>whore, just give us back the money and we won't have to hurt you... too much."<p>"Whore?" Ranko repeated quietly, a dangerous glint in her eyes. A quick scan of her<br/>surroundings showed that most of the other customers had cleared out, and the proprieter<br/>was hiding behind the counter. That meant she could get away with a fair bit of property<br/>damage, but first she wanted to know exactly what was going on. "What the hell did you<br/>do, old man?" she asked Genma.<p>"Well... I had a lot of debts to pay off, and it's not like anyone would mind if I stole from<br/>criminals..." Genma attempted to explain reasonably.<p>"Yeah. No one except the criminals you moron!" Ranko replied angrily. "Besides,<br/>weren't you supposed to be getting a job to bring money in?"<p>"I did!" Genma protested. "I was working as a watchman at the industrial park when I<br/>saw them selling drugs. I overheard that they were doing it without the Oyabun's consent,<br/>so I didn't expect any reprisals from the Yakuza..."<p>"What Oyabun doesn't know won't hurt him. And it wouldn't have hurt you if you'd kept<br/>your nose out of our business," the leader snarled.<p>"Alright then, old man. Take your beating and give them their money back, I don't<br/>wanna deal with this crap." Ranko turned to face Genma as she spoke.<p>"I spent it all..." Genma said in a small voice.<p>"WHAT?" the leader roared. "How the fuck could you spend two million yen in three<br/>days?"<p>"Well, I had a lot of debts..."<p>The Yakuza growled before gesturing to his thugs. "Waste the pair of them, boys." The<br/>sound of guns being readied was clearly audible through the hushed silence after that<br/>statement.<p>Ranko gasped and lashed out with a rear kick which snapped the man's leg like a dry<br/>twig, sending him to the floor howling in agony. In the same movement, she spun round<br/>and picked up her stool, not even slowing down as the bolts securing it to the floor were<br/>ripped out, and hurled it at the three thugs at the door. She was gratified to see one end<br/>crushed the arm of the middle thug, before spinning off and striking a glancing blow on<br/>the head of the one next to him, rendering him unconscious. The three went down in a<br/>tangled heap, with the uninjured one struggling to pick himself up from beneath his<br/>wounded fellows and the stool.<p>Spotting the last remaining thug was just beginning to raise his gun, Ranko grabbed a<br/>chopstick from her bowl and flicked it with pinpoint accuracy to jam the barrel.<br/>Smirking at her own impressiveness, she opened her mouth to gloat, and was quite<br/>surprised when the gun, instead of exploding in suitably comedic fashion, fired normally<br/>(albeit preceded by bits of chopstick shrapnel flying everywhere) in her direction.<p>"You shot me?" she cried out in surprise, looking at where the sleeve of her blouse was<br/>torn and a small burn ran across her arm from the bullet's passage. "I can't believe you<br/>shot me!"<p>"The next one won't just graze you, bitch!" the thug replied, angry at having his aim<br/>knocked off by the chopstick. He had been trying to shoot Genma, but since the portly<br/>martial artist was just cowering there, he decided the girl was the greater threat.<br/>Unfortunately he was unaware that in forcing the chopstick out in his prior shot, the gun<br/>barrel had been deformed, which resulted in the cartridge being blown back through the<br/>gun and exploding all over his hand after he pulled the trigger.<p>"Yeah! That's what shoulda happened the first time!" Ranko crowed as the final thug<br/>went down screaming and clutching his bloodied limb.<p>Of course, now that everything had been dealt with, that was the cue for the police sirens<br/>to become audible and rapidly louder as law enforcement arrived belatedly to take over.<p>***<p>Genma smirked at his own cleverness. While he was sure that he could have dealt with<br/>those thugs last night by himself, he was grudgingly impressed with the girl's<br/>performance, and after they had given their statements to the police (leaving out any<br/>mention of illegal drug money), he had convinced her to go somewhere else to continue<br/>their 'father - daugher-in-law' bonding. Then he had proceeded to add his sake to her own<br/>non alcoholic drinks whenever she wasn't looking.<p>Ranko had a pitiful alcohol tolerance, so it hadn't taken more than three spiked drinks<br/>before she was more than a little tipsy and then started ordering straight sake for herself.<br/>After that it had been child's play to convince the sloshed schoolgirl to sign a document<br/>swearing that she would give up her claims on the boy. Admittedly, her penmanship was<br/>pretty poor when drunk, and he didn't even know how her name was supposed to be<br/>spelled anyway, but it was probably okay.<p>Spotting his wife coming out of the kitchen with breakfast while the boy was currently in<br/>the garden practicing, he produced the paper and affected a depressed look. "Oh,<br/>Nodoka, I have bad news..."<p>"What is it, dearest?" Nodoka asked while dishing out Genma's serving.<p>"It seems that Ranko girl doesn't want to marry Ranma after all, I even have a signed<br/>paper saying she'll give up."<p>Nodoka eyed him distrustfully. "Let me see," she asked in a cold tone.<p>Genma fought to keep the grin from his face as he handed over the piece of paper. Now<br/>the schools would be joined for sure!<p>Nodoka frowned as she scanned it before looking up with a puzzled expression. "It says<br/>here that Ranma Saotome promises not to marry Ranma Saotome..." she looked at<br/>Genma curiously. "What on earth does this have to do with anything, dear?"<p>Genma fought back the tears. The girl was obviously far more cunning than he had given<br/>her credit for!<p>***<p>"Oh... my head..." A thoroughly bedraggled redhead sat up from her bedroll and groaned<br/>piteously. Staggering out of her bedroom, she poured a glass of water from the kitchen<br/>sink and drank it, trying to remove the fuzzy feeling all over her tongue. She could<br/>barely remember anything that had happened last night, the only thing she was certain of<br/>was the confirmation that her stupid girl body couldn't handle its drink.<p>Oh, and getting shot. That was certainly one of her less clever moments, since she was<br/>pretty sure there were plenty of other ways to disable the guy without trying that fancy<br/>chopstick trick she remembered seeing in a movie once. Still, getting shot hadn't hurt that<br/>much compared to some of the more dangerous ki attacks she had been hit with, but if<br/>the bullet had been a foot to the right... she didn't want to think about what could have<br/>happened...<p>The next thing she noticed was that her feet were covered in vomit, and there was a trail<br/>of the stuff all over the floor, terminating at the sink. "Eeww!" She recoiled from the<br/>sight of her dirty dishes, made even more disgusting by the thick spattering of puke all<br/>over them.<p>A knock at the door sent shudders of pain through her head, and she weakly made her<br/>way over to the door, wondering who would be inconsiderate enough to bother her at this<br/>ungodly hour when she was feeling so rough.<p>"You have a package, Xiawang-san," her apartment manager greeted her, struggling<br/>with a fairly large box.<p>Ranko glared at him balefully, or at least tried to until she discovered her eyes wouldn't<br/>focus properly. "Gimme," she mumbled, taking it from him and slamming the door in his<br/>face. Looking at it, she was surprised to see that it wasn't addressed to her, but hers was<br/>the return address. Dumbly, she scratched her head and wondered aloud. "When did I<br/>send something to Antarctica?"<p>***
