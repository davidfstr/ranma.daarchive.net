</div>Ranma 1/2 Belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan<p>A Not so Simple Wish<br/>Chapter 18<br/>by Ebiris<p>Ranko sat alone in her apartment as she considered Ranma's latest request. On the face of<br/>it, it was a good thing. He wanted to learn from her, which hopefully meant he'd stop<br/>making demeaning comments about her ability, and would also give them a chance to<br/>spend more time together. A win win scenario, right?<p>Wrong.<p>Ranko loved martial arts, and therefore she loved learning martial arts. She knew no<br/>greater thrill than the ecstacy of combat and the joy of mastering a new technique.<br/>Simple logic dictated that the same would hold true for Ranma. The problem was, that as<br/>much as she enjoyed learning, she had never really had a good relationship with any of<br/>her teachers. While she had visited a few dojos and studied under various masters on her<br/>training trip, none of them had really left much of an impression on her. As far as she was<br/>concerned there were only a few people who had really taught her anything useful, and<br/>those few were not her favourite people, mainly due to the harsh training.<p>First, and most obviously, there was Genma. He had been training her for as long as she<br/>could remember, and while she might grudgingly admit to loving the old man, it was<br/>only because he was her pop. His training was nothing short of brutal, and turned a<br/>loving father/son relationship into an adversarial relationship which barely<br/>acknowledged that they could tolerate each other. She did not want Ranma thinking of<br/>her the same way she thought of her father.<p>Then there was Cologne. The wily old Amazon had only taught her a few moves and<br/>training exercise, but those were among the most devastating in her arsenal. And while<br/>Ranko could respect the old ghoul, she sure as hell didn't like her. Cologne's methods<br/>were actually quite similar to Genma's (a fact which would no doubt horrify the Amazon<br/>matriarch) in that she challenged to student to do better by insulting them and by<br/>occasionally giving hints of her full capabilities with the inference that the student would<br/>one day be capable of that (yes, Genma had done that too, when Ranma was a child, but<br/>in more recent years had run out of tricks to impress his child).<p>And just to round things off, Happosai, the grandmaster of Anything Goes himself.<br/>Ranko actually had two versions of Happosai to compare. From her old life, the letch<br/>had barely taught her a thing, and his training methods seemed to centre around forcing<br/>the student to escape, or be beaten on by, a crowd of angry women - which would of<br/>course improve either speed or endurance depending on what happened. In this reality<br/>however, he had simply sparred with her and let her examine his martial arts scrolls and<br/>pressure point charts. He didn't really act like a master, since he pretty much left her to<br/>her own devices, with no real challenge to learn - of course, Ranko provided that by<br/>herself.<p>Sighing huffily, blowing up her bangs in the process, Ranko tried to figure out how to<br/>approach her training with Ranma, since none of the examples she had to work from<br/>seemed conductive to romance.<p>"Okay." she said to herself, trying to work up some determination to come up with a<br/>solution. "It's speed training. You've done loads of different speed training exercises,<br/>what one would work best for teaching Ranma without making him hate you?"<p>First there was the Saotome Anything Goes food duelling. Stealing food from her pop<br/>while defending her own plate had been a constant throughout her life and had indeed<br/>given her the incredible speed which was the core of her style. The problem was that<br/>Ranma had already mastered that, and besides which, it did little to endear yourself to the<br/>person you are duelling with.<p>Moving on, the Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken was perhaps the most obvious, being the<br/>first new training she herself had encountered since coming to Nerima. However, the<br/>name was a misnomer, since the speed had actually come from constantly duelling with<br/>Cologne, with plucking the chestnuts from the fire being the end result. She had little<br/>doubt that one *could* improve their speed from constantly attempting that feat, but it<br/>would likely result in a lot of wasted time waiting for the hands to recover from burns.<p>Then there was Anything Goes advanced speed training, which involved the trainee<br/>standing under a hornets nest while the sensei chucks rocks at it. Dodging those hornets<br/>had done wonders for her all round speed, reflexes and spatial awareness. Ranko decided<br/>that this method was currently the best, since Ranma would get mad at the hornets, not at<br/>her... actually, if she was the one chucking the rocks he might not see it that way... "I'll<br/>have to think about that..." she decided.<p>The Parlay du Foie Gras? That wouldn't work, since her training for that had hinged on<br/>the change between male and female while wearing an iron corset.<p>That about covered all the advanced speed training methods she knew of, beyond simple<br/>rapid punch drills. "Guess I'll haveta suggest a trainin' trip..." she mused, wondering how<br/>difficult it would be to actually find some hornet's nests, since it was still early Spring.<br/>Checking the clock, she decided to start getting ready, since she had been invited to<br/>dinner at the Saotomes, along with Kasumi, to celebrate Ranma's victory over Ryouga.<p>***<p>Ranma grinned as he finished recounting the tale of how he had defeated Ryouga, feeling<br/>his self worth puff up immeasureably at the starry eyed look of adoration his mother was<br/>giving him. It made a pleasant change from the vaguely disapproving fretting she did<br/>after his recent beatings from Happosai.<p>"Oh, I knew I did the right thing letting your father train you, my son! You truly are a<br/>man among men!" The Saotome Matriarch gushed exuberantly.<p>Genma puffed up himself at the vindication of his decision to take the boy away so he<br/>wouldn't be coddled. while Kasumi smiled with a touch of sadness, feeling the honest<br/>love and warmth from Nodoka and remembering her own departed mother.<p>Ranko, on the other hand, looked as if she might burst into tears, and hurriedly excused<br/>herself to go to the bathroom.<p>"What's up with her?" Ranma wondered out loud after the redhead had departed.<p>"Forget about her boy!" Genma said gruffly, giving Ranma a slap on the back. "Your<br/>real fiancee is right here!" He indicated Kasumi with a sweep of his hand.<p>"Dearest!" Nodoka said reprovingly at Genma's lack of tact, before giving Ranma a<br/>gentle look. "I think Ranko-chan misses her own parents, son. She tends to get emotional<br/>at familial scenes."<p>"Ranko is an orphan?" Kasumi asked in a horrifed whisper, not having expected that of<br/>the girl she was supposed to call a rival. She supposed she should have realised<br/>something like that since Ranko's parents were neither seen nor mentioned at all when<br/>this whole multiple fiancee thing blew up.<p>Nodoka nodded sadly. "Yes, I understand it was fairly recent, the poor dear doesn't like<br/>to talk about it. And neither should we be talking about it when she gets back." She<br/>finished with a tone indicating the subject was to be dropped. She cleared her throat<br/>before speaking again in a more business-like tone. "Anyway, Genma, I notice that while<br/>I have gotten to know Kasumi-chan, and found her to be a lovely young lady - though of<br/>course, I still like Ranko-chan and leave the choice entirely up to Ranma - I notice that<br/>you and Ranko-chan have done nothing to get to know one another."<p>"I don't see why I should." Genma huffed petulantly. "The boy will marry Kasumi here<br/>to unite the schools. That girl is irrelevant."<p>"I don't see why I haveta get married at all." Ranma said in a tone which mirrored his<br/>father's exactly, but he was ignored by all except from a sympathetic glance from<br/>Kasumi.<p>"Now, dearest, Ranko-chan could well end up your daughter-in-law, and it wouldn't be<br/>seemly to have a rift in the family. I suggest that you and she go out and have dinner or<br/>something some time to really get to know one another. I'm sure if you gave the girl a<br/>chance you'd get along wonderfully with her, just as I have with Kasumi-chan." Nodoka<br/>replied casually, although the way she said the word 'suggest' implied it was an order and<br/>not a suggestion.<p>Genma was about to respond when he spotted the girl in question walk back into the<br/>room and seat herself back at her place beside Ranma, opposite Kasumi on his other side.<br/>"I hope I didn't miss anything." She said cooly. Her posture was stiff and she seemed to<br/>be taking great care to control her movements.<p>Ranma felt an involuntary shiver run through him as the girl sat down next to him, and<br/>wondered why he suddenly felt so cold. Glancing out of the corner of his eye, he noticed<br/>Ranko was focused intently on the meal, but only seemed to be picking at her food while<br/>avoiding eye contact with anyone.<p>Ranma almost sighed, but kept it down since his mother would no doubt remonstrate him<br/>for being rude. He didn't have a clue what to do about the two girls he was engaged to.<br/>He liked them both, but he was way too young to consider getting married even if he<br/>could decide which one would make the better choice.<p>He had gotten to know Kasumi quite well over the past few days, since she would come<br/>to his house and walk him to school and they would talk about various things. While on<br/>the surface she acted like a traditional Japanese housewife (Ranma thought it a crime the<br/>way the Tendous took her for granted) she did possess a very clever sense of humour -<br/>perhaps even a bit too clever, since often she would say something in the morning and<br/>Ranma wouldn't figure out the hidden meaning until halfway through the day. She was<br/>also very attentive to what he had to say, and didn't look down on him for his lack of<br/>education as many people did, which was a definite plus.<p>Ranko... well, were Ranma of a more literary bent he might describe her as a puzzle<br/>wrapped in an enigma, but being who he was, he'd settle for 'weird'. She certainly wasn't<br/>weird in a bad way, in fact Ranma found himself almost enthralled by the rapid twists<br/>and turns of her personality. One minute she could be so self assured and confident that it<br/>was hard not to see some of himself in her behaviour, then she'd turn into an almost ditzy<br/>and overemotional little girl. Then there was now, she was showing yet another side of<br/>her multifaceted personality, a side he barely remembered witnessing when he had first<br/>been reunited with his mother. Seeing her so melancholoy, so... vulnerable... Ranma<br/>wanted nothing more than to protect her from the world, to make her smile again. But he<br/>really didn't know what to do...<p>Not being able to find a clear winner based on their personalities, Ranma considered their<br/>appearances. Not that he was so shallow as to make a decision on that, but it was still<br/>something to think about.<p>Kasumi carried herself with a demure elegance which he had seen in precious few<br/>women in his life. Her features were that of a classical Japanese beauty, though she was a<br/>little taller than average, she was very well built, with smooth skin and supple curves.<br/>While not a very active person, Kasumi obviously still managed to keep herself in<br/>excellent shape, with not an ounce of fat except in the right places. Certainly any man<br/>would be lucky to have a woman like her by his side.<p>Ranko was perhaps the exact opposite of Kasumi, while still being beautiful in her own<br/>way. The redhead's looks were both exotic and vibrant, certainly looking out of place<br/>amongst the typically dark haired Japanese (though he idly noted that his mother's hair<br/>had a hint of red in it as well, though it was significantly darker than Ranko's fire engine<br/>red). While Kasumi was tall, Ranko was very short, being over a head smaller than the<br/>other girl. Her figure was trim and lithe, no doubt from her extensive training in the<br/>martial arts, with only her breasts looking out of place, seeming too large for her figure.<br/>Though she was still young enough to have another growth spurt, so that would probably<br/>be negated in a year or two.<p>Finishing his little thought exercise, and still being no closer to any kind of decision,<br/>Ranma returned his attention to conversation around the dinner table just in time to hear<br/>Nodoka make her suggestion to Ranko that she should get to know her prospective father<br/>in law, which finally seemed to rouse the girl from her depression.<p>"I have to spend time with him?" Ranko exclaimed, pointing at Genma with her<br/>chopsticks.<p>"This is no picnic for me, girl." Genma huffed grumpily, seeming rather put out at her<br/>negative reaction to the prospect.<p>"Yes." Nodoka said, remaining consciously oblivious to their ire. "It only makes sense,<br/>since you could become family, that you get to know one another."<p>Neither Ranko nor Genma were able to come up with any really convincing reason to get<br/>out of it, so they settled for sulking for the rest of the meal, causing everyone else at the<br/>table to note just how oddly similar their mannerisms were.<p>***<p>It was with no small amount of trepidation that Kasumi entered the Tendou household<br/>after leaving the Saotomes. While she could optimistically hope that Nabiki had<br/>managed to order takeout, the harsh reality was that Akane had most likely taken it upon<br/>herself to cook in Kasumi's absence. Much as she loved her little sister and knew that<br/>practice was the only way to improve, it really did take a huge effort of will to keep from<br/>slapping the girl silly every time she desecrated the kitchen with her filth. Especially<br/>since Akane had a tendancy to lose her temper after cooking and then just leave the mess<br/>for someone else to clean up. It really was depressing when your family saw you as little<br/>more than a live in maid...<p>"Tadaima." She called out before entering the foyer and being greeted by a grinning<br/>Nabiki.<p>"Hi, sis." Nabiki said cheerfully with a 'cat who just got the canary' smile on her lips.<br/>"How was dinner with your fiance and his other fiancee?"<p>"It was nice." Kasumi said pleasantly. "Auntie Saotome is a great cook. I take it from<br/>your attitude that you were able to keep Akane out of the kitchen while I was gone?"<p>"Ah... not exactly..." Nabiki faltered slightly before resuming her happy expression. "But<br/>for once that's a good thing, since her food was able to weaken the little bastard enough<br/>for me to get rid of him!"<p>Kasumi frowned. "Nabiki, that's not very nice."<p>"He's not very nice!" Nabiki shot back.<p>"He hasn't done anything bad to me. Maybe you did something to upset him and that's<br/>why he acts out towards you." Kasumi suggested.<p>Nabiki threw up her hands in exasparation. "Sis, I barely said three words to him before<br/>he stole my bra. It wasn't anything I did, he's just pure evil!"<p>"Those three words wouldn't have been 'Give me money', would they?" Kasumi asked<br/>dryly.<p>Nabiki chuckled nervously at her sister. "Eh heh... those weren't my exact words..."<p>Kasumi sighed. "Whatever. So where's father and Akane, and how exactly did you get<br/>rid of Happosai-jisan?"<p>"Daddy went to bed, he's not feeling to well for obvious reasons, and Akane's in the dojo<br/>breaking bricks and muttering to herself about how no one appreciates her. As to how I<br/>got rid of the freak, heh, I have to admit it's one of my finer moments. While all those<br/>martial artists like daddy, Akane and Ranma failed to do anything, a little bit of Nabiki<br/>Tendou brainpower was able to save the day!" The short haired brunette exclaimed<br/>proudly. "I stuck him in a box filled with daddy's underwear and mailed it to<br/>Antarctica!" She beamed at Kasumi, no doubt expecting to be soundly praised for her<br/>brilliance.<p>Kasumi blinked. "How could you afford postage to Antarctica?"<p>"Aha! I'm glad you spotted that Kasumi. Proves I'm not the only one with brains in the<br/>family." Nabiki snapped her fingers as she spoke. "I didn't put enough stamps on it, but<br/>for the return address, I used Ranko's apartment, so even if it doesn't get all the way to<br/>Antarctica, he'll still be out of our hair."<p>"How very clever of you, Nabiki." Kasumi smiled beatifically at her little sister, pleased<br/>that Nabiki seemed so chipper for once.<p>"Heh." Nabiki smugly inspected her nails. "You have to get up pretty early in the<br/>morning to get past Nabiki Tendou."<p>"Nabiki, I'm your sister and I know what you're like in the morning." Kasumi remarked<br/>flatly. "I could sell you to a Thai brothel and you probably wouldn't notice until after<br/>lunch."<p>Nabiki jolted slightly and looked at Kasumi with a slightly aghast expression. "Y-you<br/>wouldn't do that to me though, right?"<p>Kasumi shook her head and sighed before embracing the other girl in a hug. "Nabiki,<br/>you're my little sister and I love you. Of course I wouldn't do that to you." Then she<br/>looked over Nabiki's shoulder and saw the disaster that her kitchen had become It would<br/>probably take her at least a couple of hours to clean, and more likely than not she'd have<br/>to buy a few new pots and pans. "Now, Akane on the other hand..."<p>***
