</div>Chapter 12<p>Just as Ranma stepped into the grounds of Furinkan High school, he was passed by a girl<br/>he vaguely recognised as Kasumi's little sister. The girl was running and quietly chanting<br/>a mantra that sounded suspicously like "I hate Ranko, I hate Ranko, I HATE RANKO!"<p>Said redhead was just about to peacefully make her way into the main building without<br/>incident when Akane made her presence known with her usual "Ranko Xiawang! I<br/>challenge you!" (she had finally stopped making the 'Reiko' mistake last week).<p>"Aw geez, Akane. Give it a rest, you suck." Ranko made a half hearted protest as Akane<br/>launched into a flurry of attacks. The scene was mostly ignored by the students as being<br/>routine, but Ranma was one of the few people who were watching intently.<p>Ranko was standing in a relaxed pose with one hand still clutching her bookbag while<br/>the other hand darted about to intercept every single one of Akane's attacks with no sign<br/>of real effort. She wasn't even looking at her opponent as her eyes were fixed upon the<br/>school clock "You're gonna make us both late ya stupid uncute tomboy."<p>Ranma sniggered. He'd have to remember that insult.<p>"Dammit, why can't I beat you?" Akane raged as she increased the ferocity of her<br/>attacks, yet every blow was gently redirected by a single finger on Ranko's dainty hand.<p>"Because you suck, Akane." Ranko explained in a tired tone of voice "In fact, I feel my<br/>own skill is degrading just from having to waste time on your stupid challenges. You're<br/>not even a real martial artist, just a little girl that likes to pretend. In fact... from now on<br/>I'm going to treat you exactly as you deserve." so saying, she trapped Akane's fist after<br/>her next punch and yanked her off balance before trapping the girl in a headlock.<p>"Let me go!" Akane protested as she flailed wildly, trying to find purchase to reverse or<br/>counter the hold to no avail.<p>Ranko got an evil gleam in her eye as she announced dramatically "Anything Goes<br/>Ultimate Noogie Attack!" and started rubbing Akane's head with her knuckles. She<br/>wasn't going very fast (by her standards) since her full speed would likely set the poor<br/>girl's head on fire, but it was certainly enough to hurt.<p>After a few seconds of this, Akane was released and fell stumbling into the arms of her<br/>would be beloved. "Akane Tendou, do you require assistance?" Asked the Blue Thunder<br/>(although he only decided upon that name this morning and had yet to use it, so everyone<br/>still thought of him as the Shooting Star).<p>This latest humiliation from her hated foe was enough to eat away at Akane's pride as<br/>she looked up at Kuno with tear filled eyes "Kuno-sempai, if you love me then why do<br/>you always let her beat me?" she asked pathetically.<p>Kuno stood tall and adopted his usual regal demeanour as he postured dramatically "It is<br/>not the place of a samurai to interfere in the affairs of women. It is obvious that Ranko<br/>Xiawang is jealous of our love and seeks to win my attention by besting you in combat.<br/>But fear not, Akane Tendou, for her love will go unrequited."<p>Akane chose not to refute his inference that she loved him, just this once since she was<br/>trying to get his help.<p>Ranko sighed heavily as she wondered just what went on in Kuno's sorry excuse for a<br/>brain "I already have a fiance, Kuno-baka, and I definitely ain't interested in you. But are<br/>you trying to say I'm not good enough or somethin'?"<p>Kuno gave Ranko a pitying glance before speaking "While it is true you are both comely<br/>and possessing of the fierce heart of a tigress, it would be unseemly for a member of the<br/>noble house of Kuno to consort with an ai no ko such as yourself."<p>Ranko's eyes lit up. So that was why Kuno didn't harass her this time! She hadn't really<br/>given any thought to the fact that she was half Chinese in this life - it even made a kind of<br/>twisted sense since her girl body was 'born' in China from Jusenkyo's waters. Still, even if<br/>she was glad Kuno wouldn't be harassing her, she couldn't let his racist remarks lie.<br/>"Your sister doesn't have any problem 'consorting' with me." She said, drawing herself up<br/>to her full height - which of course wasn't very impressive since she was five foot<br/>nothing.<p>Kuno raised an eyebrow "Indeed? Kodachi is sadly perverse in her actions and does not<br/>always act as befitting a person of her station. She takes a sick delight in acting out<br/>against the proper rules of society. Truly my wicked sister is a depraved soul!" The<br/>samurai wannabe raised his bokken to the heavens and wept righteous tears as he<br/>badmouthed his own flesh and blood.<p>"Man, you really are dumb. First you insult me, then you insult my friend." Ranko said<br/>before kicking him in the face, incidentally providing a free show of her panties to<br/>anyone who cared to look. Not that she particularly cared about that since she only<br/>bothered to fake feminine modesty when really thinking about it.<p>"That did not hurt." Kuno spoke in a montone.<p>"That's 'cause you're too dumb." Ranko replied before flicking his forehead, causing him<br/>to topple over unconscious before she turned and entered the school.<p>"She's better than I thought..." Ranma said to himself as he watched his fiancee go,<br/>wondering just how much she was holding back.<p>***<p>"Class, we have a new student starting today," the teacher said, gesturing to the pigtailed<br/>boy at the front of the room. "He has just returned from a trip to China. Why don't you<br/>introduce yourself?"<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, heir to the Saotome school of Anything Goes martial arts. Nice to<br/>meet ya." Ranma bowed to the class and grinned, attracting more than one appreciative<br/>glance from the girls of classroom 1-F.<p>"Very well." the teacher nodded "Are there any free seats?"<p>"He can sit next to me!" Ranko was bouncing up and down while waving her arm as she<br/>indicated the empty desk next to her own. The males of the class particularly appreciated<br/>the display they were treated to as her actions did interesting things to her chest.<p>"But where am I going to sit?" Gosunkugi whined plaintatively from his position on the<br/>floor, having just been rudely shoved from his seat.<p>"I don't care, find somewhere else." Ranko hissed out the corner of her mouth before<br/>flashing a big innocent smile at Ranma.<p>The teacher adjusted his glasses. He could have almost sworn that that there was<br/>supposed to be someone occupying the desk in question. Oh well, not like it really<br/>mattered "Very well, you may sit next to Xiawang-kun." He told Ranma, who dutifully<br/>went and sat down.<p>Gosunkugi sat and sulked in his new seat at the back of the class.<p>A few minutes later a despondent Akane Tendou trudged into the class. "You're late,<br/>Tendou." the teacher observed.<p>"I... I have a note from the nurse..." Akane said in a small voice, still nursing her sore<br/>head.<p>The teacher sighed, not even bothering to look at the note "Again? Fine, take a seat so I<br/>can get back to the lesson."<p>After the class ended and they had a few minutes until the next teacher arrived, Yuka<br/>turned to give a mock glare towards Ranko "What's the big idea putting the moves on the<br/>new boy, huh Ranko-chan? What about that fiance you're always telling us about?" she<br/>teased.<p>"Yuka, meet Ranma; my fiance." Ranko said drolly as she gestured between the two.<p>Everyone in the classroom instantly leapt on that statement as the girls glared at Ranko<br/>for snagging the handsome new guy while the guys glared at Ranma for stealing<br/>arguably the cutest girl in school (Akane used to hold that slot until the revalations about<br/>her weird taste in porn made every guy except Kuno rather wary of the youngest Tendou.<br/>The fact that she constantly sought out beatings from Ranko also led many to believe she<br/>was a closet masochist).<p>"It wasn't my idea!" Ranma protested, still not comfortable with the idea of being<br/>engaged.<p>Ranko looked at Ranma with a totally downcast expression "Oh.. I see... *sniff* I'm not<br/>good enough for you..." she made her eyes start to tear up and looked the picture of<br/>abject misery.<p>"N-no, that's not it!" Ranma stammered, waving his hands in protest, wondering how this<br/>girl could one minute be so self assured and the next she'd go to pieces over a tiny little<br/>thing. I'm just such a great guy she obviously can't handle me being upset with her,<br/>Ranma thought, cursing his overpowering masculinity which girls just had no defence<br/>against.<p>"So you don't hate me?" Ranko asked in a tiny quavering voice, affecting a cute pout.<p>"Ahaha! Of course not!" Ranma laughed nervously and scratched the base of his pigtail.<p>"Stop flirting with her! You're supposed to be engaged to my sister!" Akane yelled at<br/>Ranma, thoroughly sickened by this display.<p>"He's engaged to Nabiki? Poor guy..." Muttered Hiroshi, sadly not quiet enough for<br/>Akane heard him.<p>"What are you saying about my sister?" The tomboy rose from her desk and advanced<br/>menacingly on the boy. "Besides, it's Kasumi that he's engaged to, not Nabiki."<p>"How can you be engaged to two girls?" Yuka asked curiously, trying (and failing) to<br/>picture Ranma with Akane's eldest sister.<p>"It's Mom and Pop's fault..." Ranma grumbled "They both arranged marriages with me<br/>for different girls..."<p>Yuka eyed Ranko dubiously "And you don't mind sharing your fiance with someone<br/>else?"<p>"It's not that we're sharing," Ranko protested "it's just that Ranma needs time to decide<br/>between us. Besides..." she gazed up at Ranma with a lovestruck expression "I think he's<br/>worth it..." she sighed dreamily, followed by half the girls in the class. The boys just<br/>grumbled quietly amongst themselves about Ranma being a lucky bastard.<p>***<p>Ranko dusted her hands after she finished stacking the gym equipment in the storage<br/>room. She had been pulled out of study hall to help move the stuff becuase, as one girl<br/>had put it 'Oh Ranko-chan, you're so strong!'. She didn't really mind since she wasn't<br/>really doing much studying and she tended to get this job at least once a week. But it sure<br/>would be nice if the other girls would stick around to see the job to the finish rather than<br/>just ditching her to do it all by herself!<p>She stepped out of the room onto the small paved area behind the gym and was about to<br/>head straight back to class when she was stopped by a voice.<p>"Ranko Xiawang, I would speak with you."<p>Said redhead sighed as she recognised the owner of that pompous voice. "Whaddya want,<br/>Kuno?" she asked tiredly, wondering what the hell he was even doing here since this area<br/>was typically devoid of students. For that matter, why was he even talking to her, since<br/>she was usually beneath his notice.<p>"Know that I have heard your plight, and it pains my noble heart that your love should<br/>go unrequited due to the harsh demands of Japanese society." Kuno droned on as he<br/>stepped closer to Ranko.<p>Ranko smirked "Heh, don't worry about it. I'll get by without your love." She none too<br/>gently pushed the kendoist out of her way and started marching out from behind the gym.<p>"Nay!" Kuno clapped a hand on her shoulder "I cannot bear to see this injustice pass!<br/>Even if we can never show our love in public for fear of the scandal it would cause, there<br/>is nothing to prevent us consumating our passion in secret!"<p>He did *not* just proposition me! "Excuse me?" Ranko asked, her voice deceptively soft.<p>"I cannot date with thee, but if we are careful we can still have dalliance together in<br/>private." Kuno said, oblivious to Ranko's rapidly rising ire.<p>"And what about Akane?" Ranko asked, still softly voiced, though her eyebrow was<br/>twitching rapidly.<p>"Ah, Akane! Sweet tigress of my heart! Indeed my love for her is as boundless as the sky.<br/>But worry not, fair Ranko, for I have love enough to let you bask in my manl-<br/>AIIIEEE!" Kuno abruptly stopped talking and started screeching as Ranko kicked him<br/>square in the balls.<p>Ranko spat on the ground next to him and snarled "Just when I think you can't sink any<br/>lower, you just have to surprise me don't you? Listen good Kuno, I do not love you. In<br/>fact, I don't want you to even speak to me ever again!" She turned on her heel and<br/>stormed away, steaming mad.<p>"I can't believe that asshole!" she hissed furiously "At least when I was the pigtailed girl<br/>he made an effort to be romantic, but now he just thinks of me as some sort of cheap<br/>slut" Breathing heavily from supressed rage, she gave one last glance to the gym building<br/>which Kuno had yet to emerge from behind "I'm going to ask 'Dachi to give him such a<br/>poisoning!"<p>***<p>Chapter 13<p>Lunchtime had finally arrived and Ranko was now in far better spirits, her encounter<br/>with Kuno more or less dismissed from her mind. Now she'd be able to impress Ranma<br/>with her delectable cooking by giving him a free lunch, which would no doubt take him<br/>one step closer to falling in love with her so she could get back to her old life as Ranma<br/>herself. The fact that the free food gambit never really worked for Shampoo and Ukyo<br/>was convieniently forgotten.<p>"Here you are, Ranma. I made a bento for you!" Ranko smiled cutely as she held out the<br/>proffered lunchbox to the pigtailed boy, the pair of them sitting together under one of<br/>Furnikan High's numerous trees.<p>Ranma grinned as he accepted it and pulled two more lunchboxes from his bag "Thanks<br/>Ranko, I've already got lunches from Mom and Kasumi, but there's always room for<br/>more!"<p>Ranko ignored her own lunch as she stared at the familiar oval bento decorated with<br/>fishcake swirls "Kasumi made that?" she asked in a strange tone of voice. She could<br/>already imagine the exquisite taste of Kasumi's lovingly made lunch, the exquisite fluffy<br/>rice and juicy little squid sausage tantalising her taste buds. While Ranko considered<br/>herself a pretty good cook, she desperately missed the sweet taste of Kasumi's cooking -<br/>not even her mother's could compare!<p>"Yeah... you're not jealous or nuthin' are you?" Ranma asked, slightly defensively as he<br/>misinterpreted her meaning.<p>Ranko licked her lips as she ignored Ranma to focus fully on the no doubt delectable<br/>lunch that was just out of reach. The fact that said lunch was on Ranma's lap made the<br/>boy misinterpret her once more as he started to discreetly shift away from the spellbound<br/>girl.<p>"Uh... Ranko... I don't think..." he started saying but was abruptly interrupted as the<br/>redhead thrust her own lunchbox under his nose.<p>"I'll trade you my lunch for Kasumi's!" she blurted out eagerly.<p>"But you already gave me a lunch..." Ranma pointed out, indicating the bento he had<br/>just been given.<p>"This one's better since I made it for myself." Ranko blithely dismissed his concerns with<br/>a wave of her hand.<p>"I don't think I should give you this... I mean, Kasumi did make it for me, after all."<br/>Ranma cradled Kasumi's bento protectively, causing Ranko to make distressed<br/>whimpering noises.<p>"Please!" Ranko looked up at him with the most pathetic begging expression she could<br/>muster "I'll give you my lunch and..." she started fishing through her pockets and drew<br/>out a crumpled note and some coins "One thousand and... sixty five yen!"<p>Ranma was now starting to figure out that Ranko wanted the lunch, not to deprive him of<br/>Kasumi's food in some kind of oneupmanship, rather she just wanted it because it was<br/>really that good. This of course made him even more protective "That's alright Ranko,<br/>you just eat your lunch and I'll eat mine." he said reasonably.<p>"No... I'll do anything for that bento... Anything!" Ranko looked at Ranma with a<br/>pleading expression which caused Ranma to swallow a lump in his throat as he thought<br/>of several things he could ask of her...<p>"Um.. Y-you d-don't havta do nothin' Ranko, howsabout we just share?" he said,<br/>blushing furiously.<p>"Wai! Thankyou!" Ranko cried out joyfully as she grabbed Kasumi's bento and dug in.<br/>Good God, she had missed this! Only one more reason to get back her old life so she<br/>could enjoy Kasumi's cooking every single day... or at least every single day until<br/>Kasumi moved out, then it would be Akane's cooking for the rest of her life. Ranko<br/>shuddred violently at the prospect, but the wonderful taste of Kasumi's lunch soon<br/>washed away her doubts and she immersed herself in one of her favourite activities; that<br/>being eating fine cuisine.<p>The two of them spent the rest of lunch happily eating together, although Ranma kept<br/>getting distracted by the downright orgasmic moans of delight his companion made after<br/>nearly every bite. For her part, Ranko was just pleased at eating Kasumi's much missed<br/>cooking, and was blissfully unaware of the effect she was having on her erstwhile fiance.<p>***<p>"Man, I'm glad today's over," Ranma leaned back with his hands clasped behind his head<br/>"I'd forgotten how boring school is."<p>"No kidding." Ranko nodded in agreement as she stuffed her papers into her schoolbag.<br/>"Hey, you wanna come with me after school? I've got a friend who's been dying to meet<br/>you."<p>"Er... I dunno..." Ranma hedged, "I don't want to miss Mom's dinner..."<p>"Don't worry," Ranko slapped his back in a companionable gesture "she won't make it<br/>until you get home. Besides, just tell her you were having tea with two beautiful young<br/>girls. She'll be thrilled!" She winked cheerfully at him.<p>Ranma unconsciously found himself nodding. His mother did tend to get rather<br/>disturbing when the subject of girls came up... "Yeah, I guess it couldn't hurt." he<br/>shrugged "Why not?"<p>"That's the spirit!" Ranko enthused "Trust me, you and 'Dachi' will get along great. Just<br/>um..." for a moment she looked slightly nervous before recovering her poise "Just don't<br/>get too freaked out by her laugh. She's really nice once you get past that."<p>"O...kay...?" Ranma sounded rather unsure of himself as he followed Ranko out the<br/>classroom.<p>"Man, I can't believe Ranko's engaged to that hunk..." Sayuri groused, watching them<br/>leave before she grabbed a brush and dustpan to commence the daily duty of cleaning the<br/>classroom which she was assigned to that day.<p>"Yeah, she's so lucky." Yuka agreed as she went over to the blackboard to clean the<br/>erasers "They really do seem like a perfect couple though..." she trailed off and sighed<br/>wistfully.<p>Sayuri stuck out her tongue at her friend "He'd make a better couple if he was with me I<br/>think."<p>Yuka chuckled "Trust you to say that! But seriously, they just seem so right together -<br/>almost like they were made for each other."<p>"I guess." Sayuri shrugged nonchalantly "Hard to believe he's engaged to Kasumi as well<br/>though..."<p>***<p>Kodachi Kuno, Black Rose of St Hebereke, rising star of... well, nothing really since she<br/>quit rhythmic gymnastics... entered the small cafe halfway between the Kuno estate and<br/>her school and looked around.<p>Nope, no sign of her redhaired friend. Not that that was unusual since the cafe was closer<br/>to St Hebereke than Furinkan, so Kodachi was normally the first to arrive. Settling into a<br/>seat by the window, she signalled the waitress and ordered a cup of darjeeling tea,<br/>sighing in contentment after taking a sip.<p>After a few moments of silent contemplation, Kodachi looked up to see Ranko entering<br/>the premises accompanied by a boy wearing the uniform of Furinkan High. A rather<br/>handsome boy too, she noted idly.<p>"Hey 'Dachi!" Ranko cheerily greeted her friend as she took a seat, gesturing for her<br/>companion to do the same before signalling the waitress for two cups of tea.<p>"A pleasant day to you, Ranko-chan... now won't you introduce me to your delightful<br/>friend?" Kodachi purred, giving a sultry look towards the boy, who shied away<br/>nervously in the most endearing fashion. It was so amusing Kodachi just had to laugh.<p>Ranko's smile became slightly strained at Kodachi's gut churning maniacal laugh, while<br/>the boy shuddered violently. "A-heh..." Ranko chuckled nervously "This is my fiance,<br/>Ranma Saotome. Ranma, meet my friend, Kodachi Kuno."<p>"Nice ta meetcha, Kodachi-san." Ranma offered hesitantly.<p>"Charmed." Kodachi replied drolly before turning her attention to Ranko "I must say,<br/>Ranko-chan, you really have made a fine catch. He's quite the handsome devil."<p>Both Ranko and Ranma flushed "Aw thanks," they both muttered at exactly the same<br/>time.<p>Kodachi blinked in surprise "Did you practice that?"<p>Ranma and Ranko stared at each other for a moment before Ranma looked away,<br/>blushing even more. Ranko just chewed her lip thoughtfuly and continued to stare at<br/>him, a puzzled frown on her features.<p>"Aw, he's so adorably shy!" Kodachi teased, "So tell me Ranma-kun, what do you think<br/>of your fiancee?"<p>"Which one?" Ranma blurted out, causing Ranko to grimace and smack a palm against<br/>her forehead.<p>Kodachi twitched. "Quite. I had forgotten your... unique... position. Be that as it may, I<br/>was asking about my friend here."<p>"Oh.. uh... she's er..." Ranma tugged at his collar while sweat dripped from his forehead<br/>"Well... I mean... she's real nice and... um... I... er... that is to say..."<p>"She's so wonderful you're lost for words?" Kodachi said flatly, her tone indicating she<br/>was not impressed with his flustering. He should be praising her to the stars, not<br/>struggling to string two compliments together!<p>"Um... I guess..." Ranma shrugged helplessly, looking to Ranko for support, but she was<br/>simply sipping her tea, to all appearances not even paying attention to the conversation,<br/>seeming rather to be concentrating her thoughts on something else.<p>"You guess?" Kodachi arched an eyebrow, now thoroughly convinced that this peasant<br/>was not worthy to lick the feet of her best friend, much less presume to be her fiance!<p>"Oh, by the way 'Dachi, I need to ask you a favour." Ranko rejoined the conversation,<br/>seeming to have pushed aside whatever it was that she was thinking about.<p>"Oh? What is it that I can do for you?"<p>Ranko's face took on a distasteful scowl as she spoke "Your brother tried to hit on me at<br/>school today. He was going off on how I'm some sort of scum and not worthy of him, but<br/>then when we were in private he tried to suggest I could be his 'secret mistress' or<br/>something like that. I was hoping you could put something nasty in his food."<p>Kodachi groaned. Tatewaki could be *such* an idiot sometimes. "While I do posion<br/>Tachi's food as a matter of routine, we both have developed a healthy resistance to<br/>common poisons. However, I should have something appropriate to dampen his ardour -<br/>I came up with it after my unfortunate encounter with Sanzennin."<p>Ranko nodded, her lips twisted into a cruel grin "That sounds great, 'Dachi."<p>Both Kodachi and Ranko then jolted as Ranma suddenly slammed his hands on the table,<br/>jostling their cups and spilling some tea. "I can't believe that asshole! He tried to get you<br/>to sleep with him after all that stuff he said this morning? How dare he!"<p>"Oh, so are you going to defend your fiancee's honour from my brother?" Kodachi asked,<br/>her opinion of Ranma rising by just the barest notch.<p>"Damn right!" Ranma snarled "First thing tomorrow I'm gonna teach him a lesson! No<br/>way I'm gonna let him treat Ranko like that!"<p>Kodachi turned to Ranko, expecting her friend would be pleased at this declaration, but<br/>instead the girl looked pale, almost ashen, as she stared at Ranma with a curious mix of<br/>emotions playing across her face.<p>***<p>Ranko looked at Ranma after his declaration and tried to swallow, finding her throat<br/>curiously dry. She was surprised at him making such a big deal of this, since she got<br/>insulted and slighted, without anyone seeming to care, all the time in both her lives. Yet<br/>more than that, she was shocked at the fact that his reaction was identical to how she<br/>would respond if someone she cared about was denigrated.<p>What did that mean?<p>Up till now she hadn't really given Ranma much thought. She was the real Ranma after<br/>all, this guy was just a copy and an obstacle to her regaining her gender and identity. But<br/>seeing him like this, she was starting to doubt herself.<p>Distantly, she noted Ranma appeared to be looking at her in concern, his lips were<br/>moving, and with an effort she focused on his words.<p>"... alright? You seem kinda spaced out."<p>Ranko nodded, having trouble finding her voice "I'm just surprised..." she whispered "No<br/>one ever really bothers when stuff like that happens to me."<p>If anything, Ranma became even more outraged, and Ranko found herself being lost in<br/>those stormy gray eyes, the same eyes she would see in the mirror once upon a time.<p>Unable to take it any more, Ranko spun away from Ranma and got out of her seat,<br/>dashing out of the cafe before she did... she didn't know what... but she wanted to get<br/>away before it happened. She needed some time to try and figure things out.<p>***<p>Ranma trudged home, feeling lower than dirt. Kodachi had blamed him for Ranko's<br/>abrupt departure, though he couldn't really understand why - he was trying to be nice! He<br/>just wished he knew why she had gotten so upset. Girls were such a mystery to him, he<br/>really wished he could understand them better...<p>"So you're Ranma, eh?" a decrepit sounding voice impinged on his consciousness,<br/>causing Ranma to spin towards the source, wondering how someone could get so close<br/>without him noticing, even if he was preoccupied.<p>"Yeah, what of it, old man?" Ranma addressed the tiny bald man that looked up at him<br/>with undisguised contempt.<p>"You don't look so impressive." the old midget sneered "Why Ranko-chan got engaged to<br/>you I'll never understand."<p>"Who the hell are you to talk about that you little freak?" Ranma snarled, his disposition<br/>plummeting rapidly.<p>"I'm Happosai, but you'll be calling me Master from now on."<p>Ranma snorted contemptuosly. "Feh, the day Ranma Saotome calls a little freak like you<br/>Master is the day I die."<p>"Well, we'll see about that. If you want to marry my little Ranko-chan, you'll have to<br/>prove your worthiness to me!" The seemingly harmless old man suddenly manifested an<br/>immense battle aura.<p>Ranma instinctively stepped back in shock and just a little bit of fear, the sheer power<br/>that Happosai was putting out was almost beyond comprehension, he'd never felt<br/>anything like it! Swallowing nervously, Ranma took a stance and reminded himself that<br/>this old man had taught his Pop, and for all his flaws, Genma Saotome was an incredible<br/>martial artist. He would have to take this seriously.<p>Still... nothing like a good fight to take his mind off other problems...
