</div>What News From The North?<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 13<p>Dian snorted. Pitiful. The crazy head's fire attacks were powerful in their intensity, but all of her physical stats were just pathetic. It was as if she never had a good day's nourishment in her entire life...<p>Ah well. Ranma said she was okay, so Dian had to accept her as a rival for the human's attention. But that didn't mean he had to like her. So he hadn't liked her for the entire month she stayed with them.<p>What he did have to do, however, was take over some of her physical training. Ranma was busy instructing classes, and when he wasn't doing something useful for the further construction of the buildings and surrounding areas, he was training himself in that creepy electrical ability of his, and finding counters for Pio's fire attacks.<p>Winter was coming, and would probably get here in the next three months. There was a lot to do to weather proof the cabins, but most needed opposable thumbs to accomplish. That's why Ranma delegated and Pio did not pester him for lessons. Survival tactics she knew well, even if winter was an unknown to her.<p>Dian frowled to himself as he unconsciously sidestepped a swipe from the red furred socio which was followed by a snap of pearly white teeth and a feint to the right. The tawny teacher saw through the feint, and batted a paw lightly to the delicately tapered snout of the Vulpix to remind her of defense. Teaching a la Ranma.<p>"Stand still and fight me like a pokemon!" she snarled.<p>"Now why would I do such a thing as that?"<p>"So I can pummel you silly, you moronic cat!"<p>"Ah, but that would be very stupid of me. There's no way I would let you damage THESE good looks!" This last was said with a dark furred paw slicking back an ear in a suave debonair move.<p>For a second there, Pio seemed to grow in size, but Dian knew that she was only bristling her fur to appear larger. A common coarse pokemon trick to intimidate. The cat laughingly thought that she might explode with the intensity of her anger.<p>When a flicker of flame escaped her muzzle though, the feline narrowed his eyes at her in warning.<p>"Ranma said not to use any flame attacks in this session."<p>Aha. Insta-deflation. He had invoked the holy name of the sole entity that the little devil respected. Dian almost rolled his eyes, but restrained himself. The red furred runt may be on the weak side, but her cunning and ferocity were nothing to sneeze at. Any opportunity he gave her, she would be on him like black on an Umbreon.<p>~-~-~-~<p>Somewhere, somehow, a poor little enslaved Evee sneezed and covered his action up as a snort. It just wouldn't do to let his keepers think he was defective.<p>~-~-~-~<p>Anyway, while Dian was bringing Pio up to speed, Ranma at the moment, was training in the slag pit. If one can remember Ranma's initial attempt at controlling his inherent electric capabilities, then the area in which everything burned away and melted into slag will also come to light.<p>Since the pyrotechnic display, everybody who had cause to use the unnamed gym's facilities came to know of the fire course as the slag pit.<p>I mean, what better place could there be to conduct heat experiments than the place where nothing else can burn?<p>Deep in meditation, the loose haired trainer was again in his seat of power. The dark Neko-ken ovoid was in place and purring nicely, the chi sphere was a mite bit larger, and lo and behold, the electric sphere, while still wrapped in a portion of his soul, had slid a fraction of an inch closer to its proper place.<p>Ranma frowled and smirked at the same time. Frowling was caused by the lack of distinctive progress, and smirking because there actually was progress being made. It felt good to get at least that much control over a very chaotic ability. He just hoped it wouldn't flare up again any time soon. He might hurt someone he didn't mean to. Control is everything to a martial artist.<p>Just as the blue eyed martial artist was about to return to the land of the conscious, his attention was caught by something unexpected. He regarded the line of spheres. Counted them. Yes, there were still three, but just to the right of the Neko-ken, something new had appeared.<p>The metaphysical shelf had extended, and a concavity had appeared. It looked like the seat for another sphere, but no extraneous balls of power were floating around that he could see. Hmm. Something to contemplate.<p>Ranma pulled himself back to the slag pit. He slid to his feet with the grace of some great feline and stretched from his fingers to the tips of his toes. It felt good to be alive and back home. It was home. In a sense. Here was where he resided, and his friends were most familiar with.  Here too was where he taught the forest pokemon the best variation of his ryu dictated by the temperament and body type of his pupils. Yes, this place could be considered home. There weren't any of those stupid cactus here too. That was a bonus.<p>But still, Ranma wanted to see what the humans of this world were like. Did anything resemble Japan, or was everything completely alien? He wanted to know.<p>Ranma's childhood had shaped him to be a very lonely person. Half the reason why he had stuck it out with the Tendo's was because they were company for him. Most of his life had been spend with his father. He was never alone; just very lonely. Now, there weren't any humans around for miles. That was the drive for the explorations.<p>He began a light kata. In Ranma terms, that meant no special moves, no ki, and the leaps had to be done without any thing to kick off of. It was pure skill and muscle memory. Jabs, kicks, summersaults and punches were all done with lethal grace. When the raven haired one took to the air in fifteen to thirty foot leaps, he had to strain around invisible attacks that a shadow fighter enacted. Ranma's blows were so definitive, one could almost see an opponent. An equal, an opposite Ranma with the same amount of skill was battling with the visible Ranma both in the mind and on the physical plane.<p>With his blood singing the call to battle, Ranma whirled and swept, jumped and flipped, and brought this titanic upheaval of climactic fury to a halt.  It was a draw. His full martial skills were tested against a worthy opponent; himself.<p>He chuckled, and then it progressed to a full grown belly laugh that brought out Dian and Pio to see what was so funny. When the cinnamon furred one barked an inquiry, Ranma wound down and faced the two curious faces.<p>"I need to get out more."<p>A double face fault.<p>"I'm getting so arrogant that I need to be taken down a peg or three. What say you two to another trip? I feel lucky."<p>Dian shrugged. Although it was good to be home, he too was getting the urge to travel. He also knew the best direction to go. The Nidoran tethra had send word through an emissary that there were confirmed sightings of humans to the north.<p>"Dian no mind, Rranma. Tethrra say go norrth. Nidorran say humans therre."<p>Ranma whirls and pounces on Dian tickling him mercilessly. Amidst the feline laughter and squirming, he demanded, "And when were you going to tell me that? Huh Dian? Hmm?"<p>The two friends were so involved with their tickle war that they did not notice a red slinking shadow creep up on them both.<p>Step.<p>Pause.<p>Step.<p>Pause.<p>Wait until laughter covers the surprise, and the LEAP into the fray!<p>Ranma and Dian discovered that they had another opponent to deal with that was also quick, but was thin enough to slip between their grasp when they tried to tickle. Gold eyes met blue. An almost feline mischief sparkled between the two, and along the tether line of the Neko-ken agreement thrummed. Time for a tag-team!<p>Attack!<p>Ranma had the bigger reach and the greater weight, so he held Pio down with a grip on her fore and hind paws, and Dian took to a side in which he tickled, seeking the right hypersensitive spot everybody had. Dian found it right along the fourth rib from the bottom of her ribcage closer to her abdomen than her spine.<p>The little spitfire erupted in vulpine laughter as she demanded to be released. After a few seconds, Ranma judged that Dian was too occupied to notice. He quickly released his hold on Pio and snagged Dian's quirked tail.<p>Pio shot Ranma an appreciative look before she took her revenge on Dian's more ticklish flanks. When Pio also paused in her gentle minstrations and yipped something to Dian causing them both to look at Ranma speculatively, a chill went down the trainer's spine.<p>He knew that look.<p>The fearless martial artist that Nerima was once renowned for, turned tail like a puppy and fled the two monsters. Said little gremlins teamed up together for the first time. It was Ranma hunting season.<p>Dian turned to his partner in crime. "Be very, very quiet. We're hunting Ranmas."<p>Getting into the swing of things, Pio stepped cautiously and whispered sotto voce, "What do Ranmas look like, oh wise hunter of wild pokemon?"<p>"Why, little kitling, a Ranma is a very cunning pokemon indeed. They are taller than an Electabuzz, faster than a Ponyta, and can jump higher than a Dotrio."<p>"Ooh. I want to catch a Ranma! What does the Pokedex say? What are its attacks and abilities?"<p>"Kitling Pio, you ask a very good question. I'll let you in on a little secret. Ranmas are a very peculiar breed. While most pokemon are of one gender or another, a Ranma can be both."<p>Big wide sparking eyes mockingly portray innocent curiosity and awe. "Really?"<p>Dian nods emphatically like a know-it-all grandpa humoring a kitling. "Yup. So if you see a pokemon that looks like a human, but has black hair and blue eyes, be careful. That is a Ranma's male form. If you get it really mad, then it can throw blue electricity at you like a Pikachu or an Electabuzz. A red headed human with blue eyes is the Ranma's female form. To this day, no one knows exactly what that form can do, so be extra careful, y'hear kitling?"<p>Can we say Jack in the box nodding? Ultimate caffeine high nodding? Vulpix playing a Meowth kitling nodding? Well, you get the idea.<p>Anyway, the Ranma hunt became moot since the human fell out of a tree overhead laughing his...well, let's just say he was laughing really hard. "Geez, Dian. You think the fall will lower our Ranma's pokemon stats if we trade him?" was Pio's sarcastically amused reply to the scene.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>The very next morning saw the trio out on their way to the north.<p>Ranma's pack was again filled with water flasks and stored food, blankets and utensils. Everything else could be foraged off of the land.<p>When there was a brief scuffle for the position on Ranma's shoulder, the martial artist rolled his eyes, and denied either of them the free ride. 'Work it out between yourselves' he said. It looked like neither of them would ride this day. Nerves and good will between the feline and the vulpine were shot.<p>A day's travel brought them along gently changing scenery. The tall pillars of Ranma's primeval lands diminished into a healthy growth of trees that were more like the lands of Japan and China that he had left behind.<p>Open areas grew more frequent, and the colonies of pokemon that they met also changed with the habitat. Nidoran were more abundant, since open grassland was more their style, and several types of bug pokemon could be seen trekking through the foliage. While Ranma was not ordinarily scared of insects, he once shrieked in surprise when a spider the size of his head landed on his head by mistake.<p>Dian would not let him live it down for the rest of the day. Pio had chased the Spinnerak from the area with a couple of weak flames, but she made no move to silence the Meowth. She thought it was funny too.<p>Night brought a cease fire of hostilities since the departure of the sun, things got a little nippy. If they didn't get along, neither of the pokemon would be able to share in Ranma's warmth like neither of them were allowed to hitch a ride. The day ended with Dian cozied up against Ranma's back like normal, and Pio resting her head on Ranma's neck. The rest of her was curled up against his chest with her tail acting as a further blanket.<p>Morning was full of casual sparring. While Pio could rival neither Ranma nor Dian with strength, her speed was only marginally lower than Dian's, and her use of tactics and survival instinct more than made up for these deficiencies. Ranma by far was the most adaptable, but then, he's had 16 years of training to their short time learning martial arts.<p>Before they officially went back on the road again, Ranma had been splashed twice, Pio's tail pulled, Dian's whiskers plucked, and all three were bruised and laughing at each other's exaggerated boo boos.<p>It had been decided (very legal and austere...they flipped a yen piece Ranma had) that Pio would ride shoulder this day, and Dian the next. That second day on the road was spent traveling at a nice steady ground eating pace that students of the Anything Goes could keep for hours.<p>The river flashed into sight every now and then, and several a fruit, unwary Pidgey and fish went to feed three gaping maws. Whenever the group made a stop for water, food or rest, another training session went into play. Training is good for the soul.<p>During his travels, Ranma also decided not to attempt further control over his electricity as there were no convenient fireproof or electricity proof areas.<p>The second day too passed without major conflict, and the forests dwindled gradually into large clearings surrounded by sparse brush and trees. Ranma also noticed some signs of passing humans. Nothing was too new, but the old campfires, and ax marks were there all the same.<p>This was it. He could feel faint ki resonances in the distance that indicated to his refined senses a group of human habitation. If it could be described as anything, Ranma would have to say that they 'tasted' human.  Anything pokemon ki was more gamey, and the plants were just bland. Rocks and inanimate objects were neutral until a force was enacted on them, i.e. Ryoga's Bakusai tenketsu.<p>At the rate the martial trio were advancing and how large the distant ki grew, Ranma could only surmise two possibilities. One, being that there were a great many people living in the village or city ahead of them, or two, the majority of those living there had some ki training. Either way, he couldn't wait to meet humans in this odd world.<p>After three more hours of travel, Pio looked upward from her perch on Ranma's shoulder to gauge the sun's position. Flicking an ear in Dian's direction, she called a warning to her translator.<p>"Wherever we're going, we won't make it there until tomorrow."<p>Some rustling to the side of the grassy trail preceded Dian's reply.<p>"I know, I know, you zorra loca. I bet Ranma already knows this too, and we're going to stop for the night soon."<p>A moment passes while the cat ruminates over something. And then he exclaimed in a petty voice all felines are known for.<p>"Ha! This means that I get to stay on the shoulder when we get to more humans. Nyah nyah!"<p>Pio frowled and considered leaving her station to go punish him. Nah. That would just hasten the inevitable. She didn't want to abandon Ranma before she had to. A deal was a deal, and yen coins don't lie. It was the snooty Meowth's turn tomorrow.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>And when the dawn rose on the third day...<p>Sleepy eye booger skuzzy eyes pried themselves open slowly only to focus at an alarming rate on the face two inches from their muzzles.<p>Ranma, in all his morning hyper happy glory literally sparkled at the Meowth and the Vulpix. Blue eyes the color of the most azure sapphire water looked from golden to chocolaty brown. One could just tell the feral trainer's excitement at the eventual meeting.<p>After startled hearts went from hummingbird fast to merely greyhounds at the track, the pokemon washed the sleep from their eyes, sparred over breakfast, and loaded up for the final leg of their journey.<p>To make a long story short (yeah, 13 whole chapters of a long story), Ranma came upon the outskirts of a small outlying village at the edge of a sparse forest. And while the roofs weren't thatched and things were not too primitive, Ranma received the distinct feeling of edginess.<p>If he had been paying more attention to his emerging danger sense immediately after Jusenkyo, he might have gotten out of another persistent fiancée. And if nothing else, Ranma learns from his mistakes. The edgy feeling was back in spades.<p>When the village first came into view, Ranma just spent a few minutes absorbing the fact that he was actually seeing fellow humans living and breathing on this world. The little moving dots were lives he could connect with, people he could converse with-yeach!<p>"Dian! Your nose is cold! Don't stick it in my ear, alright?"<p>The meddler snorted in amusement. Pio also had to add her two cents worth and barked at Dian for translation, who hid his snicker and passed along the message.<p>"She say, let's go. What waiting herre forr?"<p>The raven haired one eyeballed her for a second and sighed.<p>"You're right. Why just look when we could visit, but we need to discuss something you two. I don't know what the pokemon situation is with these people. So for safety's sake, I'm going to insist that one of you stay in the underbrush as backup, in case something goes wrong."<p>And when it looked like he was going to get protests over this decree, Ranma clenched his jaw and bore on.<p>"I'm serious guys. I don't want you to get hurt. If things go sour, I can take care of myself. Yes, Dian, I know you say that in this world, pokemon do the preliminary battles for their friends. That's why I'm not saying the both of you stay in the background. This way, one is guaranteed safe, and the other has the pokemon laws covered."<p>Pio nodded her grudging agreement, as it fell to her to take the backup role. It was Dian's turn on the perch. Dian, who for his part, did not gloat over this turn of events to Pio. That was probably the only reason why she didn't singe his tail.<p>They approached from the south side of the cultivated fields. Ranma kept an alert eye on the people situation, and saw to his relief that humans did indeed cohabitate with pokemon. As it was, his arrival with the Meowth over his shoulder was announced by a small pack of Growlithe puppies.<p>That reminded the pair all too much of their travels in the far southern desert. Ranma muttered 'stupid cactus' one more time before he looked up from his position in the middle of the yapping canines. His shiver of dread from his earlier memory escalated. While humans were approaching him, this type of humanity he already had experience with, and most of it wasn't too pleasant.<p>From the looks of the combat weapons the primary feminine figures wielded, Ranma was having flashbacks to a certain tribe of Chinese Amazons. There were the vibrant hued hair colors, the odd martial style clothing, very very old women moving at a lithe pace adults half their age could not manage, and lets not forget the males in secondary roles all around the village. Dear god, it was the Niechizu (spelling?) all over again.<p>One aging figure moved closer to the pack of Growlithes, silencing them all with a gesture. With a familiar gleaming glance full of avarice and plotting, the obvious matriarch spoke in an odd language that the wild human could interpret, but did not know how he understood.<p>"Welcome, young man, to the village of the Cotann Amazons."<p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*<p>Author's notes. I am so dead for leaving you all here with this cliffhanger.<p>Finally. Ranma has entered civilization, and not only that, he has to deal with MORE Amazons. Wanna see if he does anything different this time?<p>For another note, the Cotann Amazons are completely made up, and I just chose that name since Sin and Cosin would give the wrong impression. Sin being a no no, and cosin being misconstrued as a cousin. I don't want that. So Cotann it is.<p>The brownie point system is dead, cause only two or three people responded.  I'll send out pics and stuff to ppl who ask for em, and seriously, I wouldn't mind if someone sent me some fanart, if possible. I'm curious to see what other people think and draw about my story.<p>I also hope you ppl appreciate the fact that my chapters have been getting longer in length. While still not as good as the first, things have been getting better. The ideas flowing easier and all that. Probably because I've temporarily dropped my other fics to concentrate on this one. I'm going to have to do something about those sooner or later.<p>So again, lemme know whatcha think.<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 14<p>"Welcome, young man, to the village of the Cotann Amazons."<p>Well, we readers can understandably recognize why the most feared human of the Shade forests went through several interesting colors on his way to pale white and emitted an inaudible 'eep'.
