</div>Author's Note: Well now, peoples, how have you all been doing this long Christmas holiday? Personally, I've been slacking off in a major way concerning my literary accomplishments. Have you missed me? I've finally gotten off my duff, with a few well placed kicks in the form of some candidly written emails. Of which I am grateful... ... ... I think.<p>Anyway, I know I probably had tons of stuff thought of for this next chapter, but I forgot most of it. Read to find on how I'm attempting to save face.<p>Oh. On a very divergent side note, I just had an odd - experience/vision- like thing. As I was sitting here on my bed looking at my stretched out leg and daydreaming what I was going to write, I wondered what my leg would look like cut off at the knee, and barbequed. Then I wondered what it would taste like. As soon as I found myself mentally stripping the bone, I shook myself out of my reverie. I haven't had any meat for weeks, on account of my poor college funds, and this was just a hallucinatory idle wish or fantasy on my part. Don't mind my rambling. I know I"m weird. Move on to the bulk of the story<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 17<p>Ranma saw the last of Dian's fleeing tail off with a fist shaken in the air, much to the bemusement of his stall mates. With a quirked grin still etched on his face, he turned back to Awl and Miter and the moue turned into an expression of sheepish embarrassment.<p>"Funny little bugger, ain't he?" was the only thing Ranma could think of to offer the two.<p>Awl was failing to withhold snickers and Miter only shook his head.<p>"Need a little help with the set up lad?" Miter offered.<p>"Nah, I've got it cov-" Ranma started to reply when the wooden supports finally decided that they didn't like each other and fell apart with a WHUMP! Silence ensued as the dust and lighter debris settled back to earth. "On second thought, maybe I'll take you up on that offer, sir."<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Pio's eyes had a glazed look to them. Boredom had taken its toll. It had set in so much, that she did not even react when a Sunflora tripped over her prone form and then ran off in terror from one of the terrible pokemon with access to flames that were known to torment his kind with their foul withering heat.<p>Not a snort or a laugh swept across her features. Her Ranma was not here, so what was there to laugh about?<p>Ah Ranma. Wasn't she supposed to be watching out for him? Eep.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>Ranma was in the midst of bracing new timber into a ready position for Miter to finish hammering nails into. After quickly accepting the man's offer, the two hastily did a bit of bartering. Miter had a bunch of wood lying around for his toy-making business and he had seen some of the handmade beads he could acquire for his wife. She would like a useful gift like that.<p>The boy he and Awl had taken under their collective wing seemed to be an alright lad. Possessing of a nice physique the womenfolk kept pausing to appreciate, and an honest likable face, the dark haired male could do very well for himself in the marriage mart if he were so minded.<p>As Miter drove home one of the last pegs that would keep the new box structure in place, his own Meowth mewed from the entrance to Ranma's stall in order to get her master's attention. It seemed the toymaker had some customers waiting. Giving the blue eyed youth a semi-apologetic look and receiving an understanding nod, the burly Amazon exited the recently swept stall and was soon overrun with the usual crowd of littles.<p>The most prolific and fecund couple in the Cotann village, Kar Bhine and Di Rhill, had come to visit their favorite merchant and sometimes babysitter. At first, Kar Bhine only gave Ranma a cursory once over on account of his even features, but once he started digging into his pack and unwrapping his trade goods, the motherly Amazon nudged her husband and whispered intently into his ear.<p>Ranma was only thinking happy thoughts as he soaked up the atmosphere of a bustling township and relished in the unwitting company of all those surrounding him. After months on his own with only Dian (and recently Pio) as the only people he could talk to, even silent interaction with the ignoring masses thrilled the martial artist to no small degree.<p>Ranma, by this time, had set out even rows of his artifacts on the front plank for display. As he was about to turn around and start on the shelves lining the back, he absently noted one of the younger pre-teens trying to slink unobtrusively toward the corner of the booth closest to Miter's stall.<p>The younger male was dressed in comfortable but worn clothes, as were the rest of his overlarge family, and his messy blue-green hair reflected the genes he had inherited from his father. Tor Che was the first son born in his mother's line, but he was the second child, and always seemed to have to look up to his teenage sister. Cuttar was always the keenest blade in their mother's eyes, and was best friends with Crescent and Pliarah, the latter whom he had a crush on. With his sea colored hair and soulful chocolate eyes, Tor Che belied his name's appellation only in the looks department. His temper and personality were fickle for the most part, but when he became fixated, his intensity burned like the fires of the sun. At the moment, though, Pliarah was the furthest thing from his mind. He had just spied one of the outsider male's statues gleaming at him in the bright morning light, and to his toy-deprived and pokemon-obsessed mind, that perfect figure of a powerful yet diminutive Nidoran called to be his.<p>Di Rhill had just finished his family's monthly transaction with Miter for new romp clothes for the little ones when he saw his second eldest about to commit an act that had rather dire consequences in the Amazon nation. His heart leapt in his throat, and in that split second, his eyes shot to the new owner of that booth in an attempt to assess how bad the reaction would be. If his son followed through what he looked to be attempting, then the teenaged shopkeeper would be well within his rights to demand the harshest of penalties: death in combat, banishment, or the loss of a hand.<p>The dark haired teen puttered around his remodeled lot, and seemingly without concern or any particular notice, intercepted Tor Che's bid for the Nidoran statuette with lightning quick reflexes. There was no change on the shopkeeper's face, his mind was obviously elsewhere, but Dhi Rill realized that beneath that unwary expression lied an awareness of surroundings that could match even the elders.<p>Tor Che's father released a sigh of both relief and pent up anger as his son looked almost ready to explode when the child didn't get what he wanted. Dhi Rill stomped over to his wayward heir and took control with the dreaded technique that all children loathed. After five thousand years, the old "Grab-the-ear-then-twist-and-pull-to-where-you-want-to-go" technique still worked wonders. Dhi Rill, with experience born of many years together with his beloved let her know with eyes only why he was leaving the vicinity. He then flicked his gaze to the gleaming stoneware that was the cause of all of the silent commotion to indicate what should be purchased.<p>Dhi Rill knew some of his cohorts would claim that would spoil the boy, but Dhi Rill knew from his own experience with his father that after the lesson was taught, being rewarded with the original cause would be both the proscribed reward, as well as a painful reminder of why the child had to be taught in the first place. The Amazon father also knew that his wife would talk to the merchant and convey their gratitude for his leniency.<p>His exit was punctuated with the irritated pained cries of his son who knew he was in trouble.<p>"Ow, dad, you can let go - Yeow! Twisting...hurt... pain!"<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Well this was just great. Please note the heavy sarcasm used in heaping spoonfuls.<p>Giovanni was stuck on one of the two story building's roofs near the southern shopping district. Below, he could hear various feminine voices shooting back angrily at each other as they argued over the prices of the much touted Amazon silk.<p>Things had gone from miserable working conditions to 'pray-to-whatever-gods- are-out-there-that-they-don't-look-up-and-hope-they-don't-realize-that-the- airhead-redhead-arguing-down-there-was-his-partner". For indeed, that was what had happened. Somewhere on the way from the outskirts of town, Carlita had managed to give him the slip and was now making a scene trying to buy that blasted silk. The situation was getting so much attention, that a representative of that outlet stall's sponsor branch made her way over from the central market to settle the matter.<p>Crescent was grumbling over the unfair treatment of her mother and rubbing her reddened ear. Her mother's grip rivaled her friend Pliarah's in pinching power. And it was all the fault of that Ranma male. With her elfin face scrunched up in dislike, she momentarily went on to speculate on his bloodline, personal habits, and association with his pokemon.<p>Ack! With that thought, her previously one track mind's train of thought halted with a hiss of steam. There was no way she could ever think such things of that darling Meowth Dian, so Ranma had to be all right. Well, it was the elder's fault then, not Ranma's and certainly not her own. Why her mother had to blame her, she didn't know. Crescent was only fifteen minutes late. Its not like there was going to be a major fight in the offing at one of the stalls which she would have to mediate. Yes, this trip would only be a routine "placating of the customer".<p>Or so Crescent thought. The blonde Amazon's view was obstructed by a gathering crowd which she hastily dodged. The volume of the two people arguing in the center was growing louder, and the voice she recognized started to get an exasperated sense to it. Crescent had no idea what to think. Her mother's silk stand employee and cousin, Ra Chet, never lost an argument with a customer. In other cities, in other lands, the merchant's motto is that the 'customer is always right'. But they were Amazons. Pride was often a factor in many of their dealings, and customers were expected to haggle expertly if they wanted a change in price or modification on what the sale item was.<p>Ra Chet had a reputation for being able to out-haggle everyone.<p>Or did.<p>Crescent just breached the final wall of onlookers to see her cousin fall to her knees in defeat. After a rush of air whooshing by with the drawn breath of all those present, the silent air showcased the awe inspiring scene. Crescent was present to witness the fall of a legend, and the birth of a new one.<p>Standing before her downed opponent in the vocal arena, a robust figured, sunset haired female inwardly crowed with glee while accepting the stallkeeper's defeat with aplomb and grace.<p>Ha! she thought to herself. This would show that Giovanni! I, Carlita, may not be all that obsessed with those pokemon creatures, but I do know fashion, and I know how to get away with demanding concessions from even the best of stores.<p>Carlita, of the presently unnamed organization for crime and general pokemon theft, may not be the brightest crayon in the box, but she knew that to gloat now would be very detrimental to her newfound and newly won shop. As well as to her health. That she prized greatly. If you didn't have your health (and maybe some elegant expensive clothes), you didn't have anything.<p>Just then, a new figure crested the stunned crowd and had 'annoyed authority' written all over her. Although a bit young for a managerial position, the strong yet curvy blonde had the air of someone being groomed for a position of real power later on. Carlita braced herself for a new battle, but soon realized it unnecessary. Her worthy opponant, Ra Chet, as she later learned, blocked the blonde's way to Carlita and confessed her own failure in clipped terms. The "Heir- to-power"s head went from shaking vehemently no, to reluctantly nodding in agreement.<p>Crescent could not believe this. Her mother would have her doing the higher forms of staff fighting for hours as punishment. Ra Chet had apparently lost the entire inventory and lot ownership to this upstart outsider female in a verbal contest Ra Chet was known to issue.<p>Well, as the representative for Renshah Goods, Crescent first had to get the stall back. Without it, they would be out of a very pricey locale. Narrowing her eyes at Ra Chet, she gestured authoritatively for the merchant to get out of her way. Stepping forward, she confronted the new owner of some very expensive goods.<p>"Good morning - um, your name, please, miss?" Crescent bit off.<p>"Actually, it has just now turned the afternoon, and it's Carlita." she snipped back. If that's the way the blonde twit wanted to play it, then that's the way she would fall.<p>Crescent sighed, as she realized that intimidation would not work on the sunset haired female.<p>"My name is Crescent Renshah, Miss Carlita. I am here as the representative for Renshah Goods, Services, and Equipment. You are now the present owner of our lot" and at this she shot a glare in Ra Chet's direction, "and I need to ask you what you are going to do with your newfound goods."<p>Hmm, Carlita thought. She's come around rather quickly. Well, I can be a bit magnanimous now. This girl, Crescent has just suffered an expensive blow. I'll sheath the claws and deal honestly.<p>"All I wanted was a few bolts of your to-die-for silk, but Ra Chet here issued a challenge that I could not pass up. One thing got to another, and I ended up winning the challenge on a technicality. Truly, I do not want the shop, but since I now own it, and its contents, I'm sure I can sell it back to you for a fairly cheap price. I've gotten what I wanted."<p>"And I appreciate your candor, Miss Carlita. If we could temporarily close and retreat into the shop, I believe we could conduct satisfactory business, as well as shut out prying eyes and ears." "Oh, of course, Miss Renshah. By all means."<p>And suiting actions to words, Crescent, Ra Chet, and the sunset haired woman with Crimson eyes battened down the proverbial hatches and went inside to discuss business. The last any of the onlookers heard was the enigmatic Carlita saying something about bartering for transportation of her several bolts of cloth. Its not like she could tote everything back to her home city on her back.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>A.N. Hi guys. Long time no see, ne? I know, I know. You all hate me, I deserve to rot in the coldest circle of Dante's Hades, I should have updated sooner. I've no excuses, no reasons, and no rationalizations.<p>Just realize that I'll send all flames to Dian for shredding, and let Pio know that you're trying to mess with the finishing of her beloved Ranma's story. And you know how protective she is of Ranma.<p>Also, I realize that Ranma is not very prominent in this chapter, but some very necessary things have been going on. Background building, contacts building, plot building even. I do believe I shall make my sad attempt at a fight scene in the next chapter, when Giovanni makes his move.<p>Please don't forget me, and leave a review. I know I'm an ass, but still. I work hard at this. Um, when I work on it at all. Well, that was somewhat detrimental to my case...I'll shut up now.<p>.
