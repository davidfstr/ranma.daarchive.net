</div>Author's note: Hey! Who said I was going to get Ranma engaged to Amazons? I almost resent the implication that everybody who has reviewed so far has assumed that I will be pushing him toward another forced engagement. For god's sakes, people, haven't you noticed that I don't do things normally? Why would I stick with that outdated overused concept? Feh, meh, and phooey on you all.<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 15<p>After thirty seconds of muttered conference, Ranma, on counsel of his trusted advisor, decided that the metaphorical kid gloves of ignorance were off. It was time to drive a stiff agreement, and if it could not be met, then they would get the hell out of Dodge.<p>Ranma again used his piercing eyes to his unwitting advantage. After a light application of the Soul of Ice, his irises paled to a glacier hue and he steadily kept the Elder's gaze while he spelled out what he wanted.<p>"Elder Jigs Aw, I believe that the time has come for us to get down to - brass tacks?" This phrase was also under strict advisement from Dian, but it came out almost like a question as to its utility under the circumstances.<p>The Amazonian woman could not help but be a little shocked at this apparent frankness from a previously worthy - if clumsy - foe on the negotiation table.<p>She nodded. "Go on."<p>"Look, Elder. What I want when I walk out of this building is not to be challenged or attacked by any of the girls...No, correction. Any and all of the females, with the intent to trap me into marriage."<p>When the wrinkled face slipped and showed surprise, the raven haired male before here pushed on.<p>"I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to make threats. I just wanted to travel and be with people for a time. It just so happened that your village was the first group that I came across. If you do not insist on what I think you were going to, then this encounter can be profitable and mutually rewarding for us both."<p>Slightly unsettled, the Elder leaned back in her seat to regard the most impertinent male she had ever met. Heh. She liked him. He had spunk.<p>"You have had troubles with Amazons before, haven't you boy?"<p>The male narrowed his eyes at her before replying cautiously.<p>"Maybe. But they officially have no claim over me anymore. There's no way for you to report this and get support from another village or tribe."<p>My my, he DOES know something about us Amazons.<p>"Be frank with me boy, and I shall be in turn. What do you know of the challenge laws?"<p>His brows furrowed and a hand absent-mindedly stroked the back of his Meowth.<p>"Don't you mean the Kiss of Marriage?"<p>It was the crone's turn to look puzzled.<p>"Whatever do you mean by that? The Kiss of Marriage only occurs after the marriage challenge has been called, accepted, and won."<p>Relief surfaced across his expression and the Elder could hear a low exclamation of surprise. "So their version is different from Cologne and Shampoo's."<p>Ranma blinked, and a slow smile crossed his face.<p>"I'll tell you what, baa-chan. If you can declare that I am exempt from the Ki-no, you called it the marriage challenge, then I can guarantee that all of the sculptures and art stuff I make for humans will only be marketable here in your village. I saw you eye my products, and I know you can get a good draw for them. If you control the...market, if that's the right word, then you can control where the money goes.<p>"Marriage is just one way to do that. It may be simpler for you that way, but I can assure you that you would have one heck of an ill tempered artisan on your hands. And no potion, love charm, or pretty young Amazon will make me change my mind."<p>Blink. Blink. Arched brow.<p>"Hmm. I have only one question for you, young man, before I agree to this."<p>Wary eyes from the human track Jigs Aw's movements and the feline subtly tenses in preparation.<p>"What's your question?"<p>Jigs Aw lets the tension gather, the Meowth bristles with anticipation, and the slight smell of ozone fills the room with the imminence of lightning, although that would be highly improbable indoors.<p>The Elder then smiles as cutely as a wrinkled old hag can and pops the question.<p>"What's 'Baa-chan' mean?"<p>... ... ...<p>FACEFAULT!<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>Pio was getting a little anxious. Things were going very slowly out here in the brush. At first, the little demon had tried to amuse herself with counting the number of insects she catches, but she lost count at around 2987.<p>Then she tried to see how far she could travel around the village and still keep the building her Ranma was in, in sight. That got boring since she could only go about 200 yards.<p>It was getting close to two hours.<p>If her ward did not make an appearance soon, she would declare war on that deceptively peaceful village, since they would have wrongfully imprisoned or hurt or killed her savior. Things were about to get ugly in about thirty minutes if a distraction were not imminent.<p>Rustling in the bushes about 10 yards away normally would not phase this creature of substantial battle skills. Something was different about this rustle though. It was big. Very big, like human big, but bigger.<p>Sounds wafted over to her sensitive triangular ears, and her devious mind sorted the evidence.<p>"Dammit Carlita. Keep it quiet. We don't want those villagers' Growlithes to hear we're coming."<p>"But Giovanni! We're so far out, those little nuisances couldn't possibly hear us."<p>"They're not nuisances, girl. Remember, they're thinking beings that have exceptional hearing. Don't downgrade something you have no knowledge about. Why oh why did the boss saddle me with this nincompoop? If he really wanted those evolution stones that badly, then he could have sent me on my own. Now I have to deal with a nitwit as well as an unevolved Evee."<p>Pio heard a little growl at that last statement, but underlying the half- hearted menace was the Evee's pokemon dialect.<p>And why oh why do I get stuck with the idiot as well as the moron who only treasures high powered pokemon? Ah well. At least the moron has an appreciation for pokemon unlike the idiot. For all she cares, we're just living fur coats and muffs on the run.<p>Pio wanted to snicker, but kept it inside due to training. She had to hand it to the cat, however much she disliked him. He made a real mean teacher when it came to silent reconnaissance. But then again, cats are just like that sometimes. Dian had nothing on her Ranma, though. The Umisenken was a real thrill to behold, even though he had not taught it to anyone else yet.<p>Ah wait, the suspicious trio were moving.<p>Pio watched them make their semi stealthy way down the hillside she was perched on towards the village below. She felt no compunction to stop them or even alert the guards to the intruders. It had nothing to do with her, and as long as they didn't harm her Ranma she was under no obligation to do anything. Besides, Ranma had asked her to guard his escape route if things became too hostile. She couldn't just abandon her post.<p>She eventually lost track of the would be thieves as they achieved the outskirts of the village and passed beyond sight. Cinnamon fur winked luxuriously in the early afternoon light as she settled down again to wait.<p>One pokemon, edible. Two pokemon, edible. Three pokemon, inedible. Four pokemon, edible but hard to catch. Five pokemon...<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Yattai! What a relief! For the first time in his life, he doesn't have any ongoing troubles with the Amazons!<p>Not only that, but these Amazons had a few striking differences from the ones he had known in his previous world. Come to think about it, that actually is a good explanation for the differences. The worlds are definitely not the same, so why would he expect the two groups of Amazons to be the same?<p>Heh, and he was worried for nothing. Now that Ranma has had a chance to talk with the Elder unguardedly, she had also mentioned the fact that they don't do much hand to hand martial arts either. The skills were lost long ago when pokemon domestication became widespread. The Amazons did maintain their usage of weapons though, but any advanced martial arts were spoken of as myth and treated as fairy tales for the young.<p>Ranma decided not to tempt fate. While he was anywhere near an Amazon's view, he wouldn't display any of his prowess with the Art. Depending on how these Amazons reacted, they might just renege on their promise and chase after him anyway. Who knows. Cologne and Shampoo did that kind of stuff before. It wouldn't hurt to be a little cautious.<p>He was here for company and as a place to get some human manufactured supplies and nothing else. Hmm, speaking of that...<p>"Oi! Baa-chan. We've been gabbin' here for quite a while. Time is a wastin' and I still haven't seen your market. How'm I supposed to sell my stuff if I don't have a place to sell it, or get a chance to display 'em?"<p>"Quite right, young man. Let me just make an announcement outside so that we won't have any unfortunate mistakes."<p>Ranma looked at her in all innocence and nodded trustingly. The elder just cracked a hideous smile and cane-walked to the door. As soon as her back was turned, Ranma arched a brow at Dian who winked and made his way to eavesdrop.<p>One might say Ranma is naive, but he generally learns fast, and uses his advantages well.<p>After listening intently at the door for about 45 seconds, Dian made a long leap back into his friend's lap.<p>"She said good, Rranma."<p>When the Elder came back inside, she was met with a considerably warmer expression on the newest merchant's face. Drat, she thought. Those tax evasions will have to stand.<p>Well after minimum fuss with exiting the visitor's center, Elder Jigs Aw pogoed over to a house nearby with Ranma in tow. Rapping on the door sharply brought movement from within which Ranma's and Dian's excellent hearing caught. Some muttering about 'demanding old biddies and their whims'.<p>With that tone of voice, Ranma expected anything from another old crone to a disgruntled woman in her late thirties. He was both pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised to see what the door revealed.<p>Stepping out of the shadows of the interior, a girl about his age emerged and looked with a cross expression at the Elder and then with a slightly revised irritated look at the handsome male beside her.<p>This new girl came to about Ranma's nose, so she was a little taller than what he was used to, and wore an Amazon maiden's warrior blue outfit. A loose gauzy undershirt with sleeves that came down to her forearms was a sky blue color and simply hemmed and edged with embroidery in a staff fighter's green and an archer's gold. Her tunic vest was in a darker hue of blue, and also similarly edged with green and gold.<p>She had on skintight brown breeches, but nothing immodest showed since the shirt came down to the upper thighs. Soft leather boots encased her feet up to her calves and were strapped with leather thongs to keep them in place.<p>In the girl's hand a limber piece of wood resided, polished with constant use, the staff was only a hairs breadth taller than the girl and as elegantly simple as her clothes. Such lack of decoration did not detract from either weapon's beauty, but seemed to enhance it instead.<p>When the silence ensued for longer than what she thought necessary, the girl shook her hair, which was a shimmery blonde with light blue highlights buried deep, and spoke up.<p>"What is it now, Elder? I have to go help with my mother's booth in half an hour, and I was hoping to get some practice in with Cuttar and Pliarah beforehand."<p>"Ah, Crescent, I have someone I would like you to meet."<p>Ranma looked extremely wary. He had thought they had a deal. What did the obaba think she was doing?<p>The blonde, named Crescent, looked back to the boy.<p>"There's no use trying to get me to like him, even if he is pretty to look at, Elder. I told you already, I don't wanna be married yet!"<p>"Good, young one! That's exactly why I want you to meet him. Ranma here is not looking for a marriage challenge either. This boy is here to provide more goods for the Cotann Amazons. I want you to show him around the market, and fix him up with a booth somewhere, since your family is in the business.<p>Crescent looked askance at the male, partly because he might turn out to be competition for her family's business, and partly because she couldn't believe that anyone that 'pretty' could do something worthwhile that had possibilities for sale. In her experience, males who were even remotely attractive acted like they should have the world handed to them on a plate.<p>"As the Elder wishes," the warrior finally acquiesced. She didn't have to like it though. He was an outsider, and foreign to these parts to boot. Who knew what his motives were?<p>The girl ruminated over this for a moment while the Elder excused herself and pogoed away cackling happily. Her attention returned to the male, however when she heard him say 'baa-chan no baka' in an semi-affectionate semi-confused tone.<p>"Well, male, I suppose you should come- Oh! Aren't you just the cutest little cat I've ever seen!" she squealed in that girly enthusiasm that seems to overtake even the most level headed of the species.<p>Dian's slitted eyes widened beyond all proportion as he found himself the victim of a revised and patented Amazon Glomp. His limbs were all akimbo and his head poked over the blue shoulder of his captor. He mouthed silently to his only possible savior 'SAVE ME!' The only reason for it being silent, was because all of the air was squished out him courtesy of a staff fighter's wirey strength.<p>Ranma could only burst out laughing at his companion's expression of panic as he was reminded of all the times he was caught up in Shampoo's embrace. He looked around for a descending mallet on reaction, even though he knew he wasn't being assaulted, and that there was no Akane to do the malleting.<p>"Sorry Dian, but I think you're on your own. I know better than to get between and Amazon and the one she's glomping."<p>Dian lifted a lip to show a hint of teeth at that, but left it alone, since Crescent was recalled to herself. She continued to hold and stroke the Meowth in her arms when she tilted her head at Ranma.<p>"How would you know an Amazon glomp?"<p>"Eh," he fidgeted, "lets just say I've seen it happen in action a while ago.<p>She just looked at him weird before leading the way further into the compound. The buildings they passed were a nice mixture of very old, structurally sound middle aged, and a few new ones to accommodate the village's changing with the times. When Crescent pointed out the Pokemon center, Ranma put his foot in his mouth and asked what exactly the pokemon did at the center? Have a day at the spa?<p>His only answer was another odd look from his guide and a whap at the back of his head from Dian, who had once again regained the relatively safe position of perching on Ranma's shoulder. When the blonde Amazon turned back to the street, Dian hissed in Ranma's ear.<p>"Ask Dian firrst. Humans with pokemon alrready know pokemon centerr. Is place heal. Lotsa herbs."<p>"Oh" he whispered back.<p>A few turns took them into an open area near the middle of the village where various booths and businesses were located.<p>"The north side is dedicated to the sale of pokemon goods. East is for foods, west is for human goods like clothes, house hold articles and weapons, and the south is for the artisans. Services are obtained in the center where apprentices stand ready to receive orders for their masters. Once a client is acquired, the apprentice sends the client to their master's place of business for the correct work to be done.<p>"What is it you are trying to sell, male? I'll place you in the appropriate section, but you are going to have to haggle for a spot. Each of the lots are owned by certain merchant families, so you're going to have to negotiate with one of their representatives. Do you understand?"<p>Dian growled at the girl. Where does she get off with that uppity tone and calling Ranma a 'male' like it was a derogatory thing?<p>Ranma twitched his lips in a moue of displeasure.<p>"Look, Crescent, I think your name is, I don't know what I've ever done ta you, but can you just call me Ranma? What's with this 'male' business? I've had a hell of a time arguing with the baa-chan just to get the rights to sell stuff here, I don't want a fight with you."<p>"Che," she replied. "Like you could win a fight with me, let alone last for more than a few seconds."<p>Ah ha! That caused him to puff up like a jiggly! It was fun to tease this guy, this Ranma character. Since she didn't have to watch him in case of a marriage challenge, she felt like she could relax a little. There was just something adorably cute about watching him try to restrain his ego.<p>She laughed a little and the redness went out of his face. A corner of his mouth quirked up a little, and soon he was laughing just a little with her.<p>"All right, all right, lets get down to business, shall we? What did you say you were going to put on the market?"<p>"Eh, nothing much really. Just a few trinkets. Beaded cloth and sculptures, both wooden and stone. I've also got an assortment of feathers for ornament work, and I can do stuff on commission if a customer wants."<p>Crescent frowled cutely in thought.<p>"So you're not limited to just one section. Ok, sculptures and ornaments are in the south, for arts and crafts, but cloth is a part of the human goods section which is in the west. We'll just find you a booth along the southwestern edge so you can continue with both of your trades.<p>"Now you're going to have to have some start up capital in order to obtain your lot. You have anything which can be exchanged readily for Amazonian currency, since I expect you don't have any already?"<p>Now it was Ranma's turn to frowl in thought.<p>"Ano..."<p>A long pause.<p>"Well this is just great," she says in annoyance. "Alright, let me see one of these statues of yours. I'll buy one from you at an expensive price, and you'll just have to haggle for a lot that's a little cheap or in a bad corner. I expect for you to pay be back for this, and I'll return your little hunk of carved rock."<p>"Well, jeez, lady. You don't have ta say it like that, yanno," Ranma snapped while he slung his pack around in order to rummage through it.<p>"The old baa-chan liked this one, so it might do," he went on to say, while pulling out a lump wrapped in a softened strip of leather. Handing it to her, Ranma sat on his haunches to the side of the aisle by a booth hawking different kinds of spices.<p>Crescent rolled her eyes before unwrapping her little package. Layer by layer, strip by strip, a smooth grey figure was revealed to her seeking eyes.<p>When it lay uncovered fully, her eyes softened and her hands tightened imperceptibly. There, nestled in the soft folds of leather lay a miniature Meowth, identical to the one perched on Ranma's shoulder, but in the cutest position imaginable. It was so CUTE!<p>Ranma just smirked when Dian dug in his claws. He knew he was playing into the girl's little obsession, but far be it for him to pass by a golden opportunity. His choice in statues had probably netted him a friend in this village far sooner than if he had to do it the old fashioned way.<p>"I'll give you a degree, two arcmins, and forty arcsecs for this. And don't bother with repaying me later."<p>"Arcmin? Degrees? What the heck are those?"<p>"Our currency, you fool! Sixty arcsecs to an arcmin, sixty arcmins to a degree. If you ever make enough money, I'll introduce you to the radian, but that's a far away concept for you at the moment."<p>"Ah, I get it. Does that mean there's sixty degrees to a radian?"<p>She lets out a mushroom puff of a sigh.<p>"Nah. That's where our currency gets a little confusing. There's ninety degrees to a radian."<p>"Oh."<p>He looked confused so the maiden went on to explain.<p>"It gets easier later, when you're more familiar with value concepts. Let's go see someone I know in the business about a stall.<p>"Feh. Alright then. Lead on, oh fearless leader," brought a chuckle to the normally calm face of the Amazon<p>Crescent finally cornered an aging man at the rug seller's stall and engaged him in a heated conversation. With much gesticulating, shouting, and chilling silences, the blonde came away from the encounter with a sheet of paper and a cold expression which instantly warmed up into a gleeful look as soon as her face was turned away from the disgruntled man.<p>"All right, catboy. I've got you the permit for a lot, and it only cost the degree and 16 arcsecs. You had better watch out when you're done with business for the day. The village's tax collectors are vultures when they see someone closing shop for the day, and if you're not careful, they'll take over half of your earnings.<p>"I'll show you where to set up, but I got to warn you, the lot is pretty run down. Repairs are at your expense, and you can't overly disturb your neighbors.<p>"Amazon law also allows for certain flexibility for peddlers, which you classify for, and you aren't required to maintain certain hours at the market. Your time is your own, but I suggest that you spend some of it operating in the noon or early morning rush hour. You're going to have to make rent on your site every third month, and each payment is thirty arcmins. Not too bad, but still stiff when you're only a peddler."<p>The raven locked martial artist was happy with this development but caught on to the underlying tone of what his guide was saying.<p>"Hey, are you going somewhere? Just leaving me here in an unfamiliar territory?"<p>"Um, I kinda have to. I need to help my mother with her own business. I've already delayed for as long as I can."<p>"Ok, but what if I have questions? How can I contact you in the future?"<p>"Just go over to the red booth at the center market. Its called the Renshah Goods, Services, and Equipment. That's who I am, by the way. Crescent Renshah, daughter to Mon keig and heir to the entire Renshah conglomerate.<p>"We've got branches all over the Amazon nation, and we've even started branching into League lands."<p>Looking thoughtful, Ranma inquired as to 'League lands'.<p>"Oh, those are over to the east. Someday, I plan on heading over there to participate in the pokemon league, and show them what an Amazon is capable of, but for now, I just want to hone my skills and complete the capture of the entire Amazonian pokemon list."<p>She looked quite bubbly at that aspect.<p>Ranma, on the other hand, looked suspicious at what she said.<p>"You 'capture' your pokemon?"<p>*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*<p>Things to think about:<p>The reason why Ranma understands what Jigs Aw and the rest of the amazons say is because humans of this world have a communication quirk similar to pokemon. Each group (or 'species' you can call it) has their own dialect that only they can understand unless they teach another. Similar to diff languages like Spanish or English or Japanese. But also like pokemon, humans will unwittingly use a 'common' language to get their point across. This factor is not present in Ranma's world, only in the pokemon world. That's why Ranma thought Jigs Aw's speech was weird, but understandable. He also used this kind of language intuitively. However, if he deliberately tried to speak Japanese to them, they would be very, very puzzled. The same goes for him if the Amazons spoke their own language, which I've decided to dub Matics.<p>Another thing. Have you guys noticed the new characters? Does one of them remind you of someone? Someone important in the Pokemon regular series? That's a major hint there as to time placements.<p>Ooh! Someone owes me fan art! I don't remember who, but if you don't fess up and send me some, I'll be forced to go back through the comments and hunt you down. Don't make me bug you! You know who you are!
