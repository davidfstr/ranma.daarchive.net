</div><p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 23</p><p>Ranma was almost to the intersection when she felt like smacking herself upside the head. She peeked with stealthy interest around the corner to see if the coast was clear before moving back into one of the deepening shadows of provided by a handy wall.</p><p>"Dian, Pio," she said while shrugging her shoulders to let them know she was going to disrupt their perch. When they leapt off and a rumbling "Rranma?" was heard, she replied.</p><p>"I'm such a baka sometimes. Forgot I could use ki to heat the water an' change."</p><p>He set down the still unconscious Evee along with the bag of iridescent stones before removing his vest. He paid no attention to his pokemon who had wandered a few feet away to seemingly discuss something.</p><p>Pio looked around... Aside from those few errant water drops still hanging from her damp fur, she could find no sufficient amount of that disastrous liquid to help her friend. Of course, she always was one to think outside the pokeball.</p><p>Baka neko, tell my Ranma that there is enough water for his change to be found streaming through the useless ball of fluff's veins.</p><p>Dian did a double take, thinking he had not heard the vicious one correctly. This time he replied in his own dialect, so as not to upset their partner.</p><p>WHAT! You want Ranma who has that much honor and nobility in his little pinky to bathe in the blood of that lying shifter just so he can switch forms!</p><p>Pio just blinked at him like it was the most obvious choice in the world.</p><p>He looks good in red.</p><p>Dian almost felt like ripping his whiskers out at that.</p><p>Think just for a second you crazy vix! If he was anything like that I doubt you would have lived for very long when we met. Isn't that what you like so much about him?</p><p>Well this caused a blink blink reaction of a different sort, while Pio took the new information under consideration.</p><p>Dian redirected his attention to Ranma in order to complain about - something, but the feline's mouth was left to hang open. Their very smart friend, who really was not a baka at all, had removed her shirt and vest and was in the process of wringing it out over her, now his, head.</p><p>Male Ranma stretched and sighed, just glad to be back in his natural form. A dull pressure in the palm of his hand reminded the human about his recent addition of hand ornamentation. There was no way he would claim to wear 'jewelry' voluntarily. A small furrow appeared on his brow as a thought came to him. That could be his pride speaking, about never wearing jewelry. If it was anything like the undue arrogant machismo that helped him to fail saving Akane, then it was something he would have to rid himself. Anything for his vow, right?</p><p>An elbow dug into the side of the form to her right. Intermittent sounds of clicking could be heard as the blonde teen's teeth clopped open and closed. The delicate face with blue green hair could not keep her eyes from distending from their sockets. Cuttar, the one with deep wine red hair and the nudging elbow was the first to speak.</p><p>"Did you two see that, or am I just having hallucinations?"</p><p>"Hallucinations!" the oceanic haired Pliarah squeaked. "That was no Gloom induced hallucination! It was a vision from the Goddess! No, that was the Goddess descended in mortal form! It was all there! Red hair, blue lightning, power indescribable... But that last part... I don't know. He changed from a boy to a goddess. But then she decided to change back? Why? Why would the goddess decide to take an inferior male's form anyway?"</p><p>"I-I think we're getting ahead of ourselves," the last of the trio put in. Crescent was the one in the most shock. She knew that boy. She had spoken with him, negotiated for him and received a small statuette from him. "It was neither a hallucination, nor a vision, but!" she interjected on an almost hysterical high note when Pliarah was about to interrupt, "there is something going on."</p><p>A small silence descended while they thought over what was seen.</p><p>One word broke the air. One word spoken by different throats coated with the same urgency.</p><p>"Follow."</p><p>Molly was in a foul mood. She was a relative newcomer in the evolution stone business and had only just received the opportunity to break away from her family's main stall. Her mother had even given her an advantage by loaning a rare celestial set of stones for advertising purposes. And look at what happened... Robbed! On her second week into the business, some good for nothing outsider had stolen her property. And a MALE no less! It was enough to start making her think her old great aunt knew what she was shrilling about when she kept harping on a male's worth during those greater family reunions.</p><p>The dark cloud of depression and anger she worked under kept even her pokemon at least five feet away while she officially closed down her stall for the night... And perhaps for good. The theft of those stones was a crushing loss, and she wasn't even sure if she could repay her honored mother back in any reasonable amount of time.</p><p>A rumbling purr of a throat clearing sounded from the other side of the counter. Molly's Delcatty mewed in concern for the inopportune visitor. He really wanted the visitor to not get his head bitten off by his mistress, but the male seemed to have something important to convey.</p><p>When Ranma's first attempt to get the stall keeper's attention failed, he ignored the purple trimmed feline's warning and rapped decisively on the wooden counter.</p><p>"What!" was snapped as Molly's rage tinted vision focused on the interfering male. But then, her eyes narrowed. "YOU," she breathed in utmost fury. Even if she knew he wasn't the culprit, she could always blame the dark haired youth for just being present. In her mind, he was a viable target.</p><p>"I believe these are yours," he said in a wary tone of voice. His body portraying the fight or flight syndrome so clearly that even she in her anger could only relax a little and laugh at his transparent anxiety.</p><p>But then again, all traces of laughter and malevolence was sucked from her being when the little pouch dropped on her counter and spilled an array of her missing merchandise.</p><p>"Wh-where did you get these?" she whispered, awe and disbelief warring on her features. Most unbecoming to an Amazon, she knew, but even old Great Auntie would forgive her this fault. Her livelihood was back in her grasp.</p><p>The magnificent wonderful honorable male before her made an adorable sound of discomfort.</p><p>"Eeh... I don't like to get blamed for things I didn't do," he noticed a blush but wasn't sure of the reason so Ranma continued.</p><p>"I just stopped the guy and his girlfriend and got 'em back. Figured you might want 'em. These're all I could find, and that bright lookin' one was in this guy's collar."</p><p>While Ranma kept his face fairly neutral during this recitation, the pokemon on either shoulder reacted predictably to his moods. Dian raised his hackles when Carlita was mentioned, and Pio snarled softly about what she wanted to do to the lying ball of fluff when Ranma raised the Evee above counter height by the scruff of the neck.</p><p>The now conscious Evee remained docile within the powerful grip the human retained, but cringed when his ears picked up murderous whispering from the multi-tailed demon behind him. It was only by the grace of one human's whim that the psycho hadn't already ripped him open to 'harvest his water and lovingly dye her partner's shirt a crimson hue.'</p><p>"And anyways, I'm sure I didn't find them all, but thought you might want this lil fuzzy as compensation. His 'friends' took a small leave of absence without him."</p><p>It was all Molly could do to refrain from glomping him (Amazon glomp: patent pending!) as she considered the offer. She drifted her hands through the pile of shiny stones, making sure to keep a hold of the rare sunstone. Pretty much everything was there except the moonstone.</p><p>"I'll tell you what..." She trailed off, hoping to get a name from her business's savior.</p><p>"Ranma," he supplied.</p><p>"I'll tell you what, Ranma. I'll give you that Evee and call it even. I doubt Muffins would like an addition that has been known to aid thieves, and while I would like to have the moonstone back, I think it a well paid expense if we could be friends after I treated you so shoddily."</p><p>Muffins the Delcatty hissed. If it was to the snickering Meowth or agreeing with his mistress about the Evee, no one knew... Or cared. Anything named Muffins never really got any respect.</p><p>Ranma quirked his lips in contemplation; lifted the Evee to eye level and seemingly peered into the depths of his little fuzzy soul. Ranma felt betrayal and sadness, anger, wariness and a very squished desire to be respected, accepted even. He nodded as a half smile sent his rugged bishounen looks through the roof.</p><p>"Fuzzy'll do, but I do believe that if a friendship is to be started, I'll have to have a name in return..."</p><p>Molly could have squealed with delight if she were only a few years younger as she informed him of her name. What would it matter his relative youth, if only she could hook him before any of the females his age. She really would have had an outburst as he leaned over the counter for a handshake to seal the deal if not for a bright glowing light coming from his other occupied hand.</p><p>A total of five sets of eyes were glued to the end of Ranma's hand. Two human, two pokemon, and one Muffins.</p><p>Ranma, contrary to most humans' normal reactions, did not drop his burden. He instead felt some tingles through the stone embedded in his palm and a slight pull on his power reservoirs. If he had taken the time to look at his metaphysical shelf, a new thread had connected to the lightning sphere as well as new shelf space extending. But of course, he had no time to investigate as the glow had died down.</p><p>A rumble of his friend's voice sounded in his ear.</p><p>"Now know why call changerr."</p><p>That's right. For the pokemon in Ranma's grasp was no longer a cutesy innocent little fuzzball. Instead, a midnight black svelte pelt was the most glaring difference, along with longer ears and limbs, and a sharper head and muzzle.</p><p>Molly inhaled sharply. "He's got blue eyes..."</p><p>Ranma frowled. "They're not supposed to have blue eyes?"</p><p>"No, they're usually red or black. And his gold highlights are supposed to be rings, not jagged ellipses. I think you've got a half-shiny, Ranma."</p><p>Said raven haired male did not say anything, in fear it might give away his non trainer status. Then again, he didn't have to, as those aberrant blue eyes looked up sheepishly at him. But with a hint of cheekiness belied the psychotic one's unnerving stare and the hissing feline's angry glare. The muzzle worked a bit, making Dian think for a second that the little lying no longer fuzzball was trying to speak.</p><p>CLINK!</p><p>Molly and Ranma's attention followed the slowly rolling stone that had emerged from the Umbreon's maw. Just as it spun itself into a tottering circle and settled with a rattle, Ranma asked, "Is that your missing moonstone?"</p><p>A.N.</p><p>Heh, not much action in this one either, but at least I haven't taken another year for an update, ne? hears crickets chirping in the background while reviewers start bringing out mob equipment</p><p>I suppose its too late to get down on my knees and beg for mercy? Good, 'cause I'm not too prone to groveling... Unless its icecream... Or pocky. Cookies are good too. What I would like to do is thank you all for coming back to this poor decrepit author and her story and even leaving a shiny review! That's a hint for all those inclined.</p><p>But to Piemur1, I do realize that I've made a slight plot hole, and it is noted on the things to be rewritten. I've just never gotten around to it. Heheh, I know, I'll replace that phony yen coin with a handmade wooden round Tuit! Thanks for the idea though.</p><p>RahienSorei, I've got to hand it to you, your theory about Evee evolution makes sense, but as you can see, it didn't quite kosher with what I was planning. If anything, I'd suggest you run with the idea and spin it into a story of your own. I'd be happy to review such.</p><p>A lot of people have mentioned the waterstone in Ranma's hand. Several of the guesses and suggestions were intriguing, but still not quite close to what I have planned. I'll give you a hint. If you think about it, what does water and lightning (or electricity) have to do with each other?</p><p>I think that's about it for now...Except... SIRED! You owe me a cookie! I updated relatively soon after the first one! I wanna biscuit! (Pronounced 'bikit' in the Sierra Falls author's dictionary)</p>
