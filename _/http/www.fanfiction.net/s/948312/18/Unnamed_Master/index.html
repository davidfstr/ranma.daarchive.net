</div>OK People, its not the full chapter, but at least it's something that tells you I'm not dead. Thanks also goes to the reviewer who so candidly thwapped some sense into me.<p>A.N. Wowies! So many questions... *looks down sheepishly and scuffs a foot in the dirt* sorry for making everyone think I was dead. You've all quite made that very prevalent in your reviews. Oh, and this upcoming chapter; there will be a fight scene, but be warned, I suck.<p>Well, as my late high school English teacher always bemoaned, I have always come up with intriguing ideas, but my only problems were with keeping things in context. I.E. always in the past tense or present. My spelling mistake I take full responsibility for, since I didn't send in that last chapter to my betas. I was a very impatient author, and wanted to post it immediately, since I've not updated in so long. Pwease forgive me? (That misspelling there was intentional, yanno.)<p>Oh, and before I get off my soapbox, while I really appreciate these reminders of my spelling, the word 'frowl' is not an unwitting consistent mistake. Point in fact, it is a very consistent mistake that I all to knowingly and willingly make. During my childhood, some words have evolved among those around me and are now ingrained in my vocabulary. Such as 'frowl'. In Sierra's Dictionary, 'frowl' is the contraction of a growl and a frown. My sister always makes this cute little wrinkled nose frown accompanied with a growl when she's annoyed, and that term has stuck with me since. I would normally apologize for the slaughtering of the English language, but this is something that is a part of me. So I'm not saying sorry, and I'm going to keep using it. So there! : p<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 18<p>Later that afternoon, Ranma was uncharacteristically feeling very grateful to his previously reluctant guide. From the moment he had satisfactorily assembled his stall, he had been on his feet non-stop. If he hadn't been told to expect such confrontations, his pride in all its aspects would have taken a serious beating, and he would have stormed out of the village, thus ruining all his previous effort with the Elder Jigs Aw.<p>And the arguing! Oh how this reminded him of being gypped by Nabiki all those months ago. His highlight of the day occurred when Ranma decided that it was time to pack it in and find someplace to camp for the night. While he had enjoyed a brisk trade with the items he possessed, the martial artist cum pokemon trainer had nowhere near the resources necessary for a prolonged stay in the village. Therefore, the option of camping.<p>With the afternoon sun halfway through its arc to the horizon, Ranma finished bundling up his remaining merchandise and returning them to his pack.<p>Stretching a kink out of his back, Ranma remarked to Dian, "Now I'm glad I took the lunch hour to ask Pio to find a camp. Poor girl, couldn't believe the ruckus she kicked up when they found her handiwork in the fields. Crop circles the form various derogatory gestures are not looked upon fondly with these people."<p>With a snort from his companion, the tawny feline leapt up on Ranma's shoulder and hooked a claw gently onto his vest for stability before replying in the human's ear.<p>"Silly crrazyhead must be verry verry borred to do that."<p>The tawny feline was by no means accepting of the intruding vulpine, but even he had to admit that her prankster cunning was very effective when it was aroused. He was also just glad that no one could pin it on him or Ranma. After all, they've been in plain sight the whole day.<p>Dian looked around the newly emptied stall for a last minute check before both him and Ranma nodded unconsciously in unison. Yep, that was everything.<p>Ranma exited the stall, pulling down the permit that Crescent had placed for him while sending a rakish two fingered salute to Miter who was watching from next door.<p>The craftsman just grinned and lifted an eyebrow.<p>"Where d'ya think you're going - male?" The last word was given a connotation he had only heard when other Japanese people spoke of the burukamin.<p>Slightly bristling along with Dian, Ranma turned to confront the oily voice that would hamper his journey to rest.<p>Although a few inches shorter, the woman before him still managed to try to look down her nose while addressing this...outsider.<p>Dian kneaded his claws a little sharply into Ranma's vest, lightly piercing skin as well as cloth. But for all the attention the raven haired trainer paid it, it could have been a mosquito.<p>While he made no outward concession to the pain, though, it did make a difference inwardly. The slight sting was the only thing that recalled the 'oh-so-loathed-male' from biting of a sarcastic taunt that was sure to get him into another fight. Exactly which he did not want at the moment, considering that these were 'Amazons', and a girl in particular. One who was looking at him like a disgusting bug under a magnifying glass, hoping the sun would come out at just that instant.<p>So yes, instead of biting her head off, Ranma took a deep breath and asked with every ounce of his newly discovered diplomacy. *insert author snorting here*<p>"To camp, I'd hoped. Why? Is there something the matter?"<p>Ranma couldn't conceal a slightly smug smirk when his question riled the female. He could just bet the female was think exactly along the lines of his previous fiancees and the panda no baka.<p>'Yadda yadda yadda, this male, how dare he speak to - '<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>'An honored Cotann Amazon like myself. He's a low born uncouth barbarian outsider who has no culture and - did he just smirk at me?' Was exactly the thoughts that were running through the middle aged woman.<p>The brown haired woman swelled with ire, and reminded Dian so much as a ruffled Pidgiotto.<p>Again, the woman spoke with her cold tone in an attempt to put the - boy - in his place.<p>A sneer on her heavy jowled face accompanied her words, "There is just that little matter of the taxes your miserable self owes to the merchants guild. The right to peddle what useless ill-crafted objects you own does not come cheap to lowly outsiders."<p>At this, the martial artist frowned. Ignoring the woman's cackle when she thought she had the outsider over a barrel, Ranma spoke up calmly, but in a voice he had learned that got through to knuckleheads, if even for a moment.<p>"I am exempt."<p>Still with visions of skimming an extra fraction from the taxes and perhaps something else, the obnoxious woman needed a second to process.<p>"Nonsense," she scoffed. Invading his personal space, she went on in an intimidating manner, "The only way an outsider like you would gain exemption rights would be if you peddled wares that would not be found in a rucksack."<p>Ranma blinked. He looked down at the pudgy hand that was running down his chest. What the hell was she insinuating?<p>Just as comprehension began to dawn across his roguish features, the hand made its way back up to Ranma's pectorals, only to be slashed with a lightning swipe courtesy of Dian.<p>That odious woman pulled back with a howl of pain and outrage, to be met with fury sparking in Ranma's eyes.<p>The woman, who had never introduced herself, opened her mouth to - what? Tell off the male? Call the village guards? Regardless of her intent, she was cut off by what she found in the teenager's eyes, and what was echoed in the Meowth that perched on his shoulder like a deadly guardian of old.<p>Clutching her bleeding hand to her chest, the tax collector gaped at the duo.<p>Said through clenched teeth and an unwavering gaze, Ranma apparently scared her spitless.<p>"I have gained exemption from the Elder Jigs Aw, and if you have a problem with me walking out of your village right now, you WILL take it up with her."<p>When she just stood there silently, Ranma narrowed his eyes, somehow causing shadows to fall over them. What started her nodding was the fact that even though his bangs and lowered brows ensured a darkened visage, his irises could still be seen as they apparently literally sparked an eery blue.<p>Nodding in time with her, Ranma then asked another simple yes/no question.<p>"We will not be having any more problems, will we?"<p>Brown hair immediately switched from nodding to shaking, also mirrored by Ranma. Dian also joined in this creepy game, earning a muffled chuckle from the watching Miter and his wife.<p>The tax collector knew that they wouldn't be laughing if they could see what she was seeing right now. The couple the next stall over were not at the right angle to be scared out of their wits, and here she was, given a front row seat.<p>Ranma stopped all head movement abruptly, with Dian in sync while the woman kept on like a bobble head. With only a slight tic in his jaw muscle and a vague twitch to his brow, Ranma turned curtly to Miter and nodded his unspoken thanks. Repeating the gesture to Awl only netted the trainer a wave before he turned on his heel and practically marched down the crowded aisle, deftly sliding through the crowd.<p>When the deadly duo were sufficiently out of earshot, Awl spoke across the empty stall.<p>"Ranma and friend: 1"<p>To which Miter replied, "Annoying Tax Collector: 0"<p>And they both broke out laughing when the pudgy woman's eyes rolled back into her head as she slumped into a dead faint.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>Meanwhile... (There's always a meanwhile, isn't there?)<p>A few aisles away, a very nice stand of evolution stones were on display. In addition to the usual grass/thunder/water etc stones there were a matched set of the rare sun and moon stones. Priced exorbitantly, these celestial stones were merely on loan from a larger collection as a lure to bring in the customers.
