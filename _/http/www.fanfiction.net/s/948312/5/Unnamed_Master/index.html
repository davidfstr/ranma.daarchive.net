</div>*A.N.* At the end of this chappie, there will be a general rundown of the suggested pokemon for Ranma. I'll try to keep it short (the rundown, not the chappie) but forgive me if I don't use your idea in the story. I'll see what I can do, and thank you for your reviews.<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 5<p>With Dian looked after, burns wrapped up in healing salve, and food and water nearby in case he wakes up, Ranma returned to the training meadow to see what happened to the whupped electabuzzes.<p>Lo and behold, they were still ground into the dirt and sparking every now and again. Ranma marched to within a few feet of them with his hands on his hips and glared at their prone crispy forms with a remnant of the icy blue flame in his eyes.<p>Almost a minute passes before he realizes that they are not reacting in any way to his presence. They are still unconscious. The pig-tailed martial artist walks off a little ways and returns with a stout branch. (NO! you ppls. He isn't gonna beat the shit out of them! Get your mind away from the ultra violence. Too much Beethoven for you...)<p>Cautiously, he nudges the yellow and black striped forms until they awake with a semblance of grogginess. Upon focusing on the visage of the human they had sought to electrocute, the smaller electabuzz was just a mite bit worried.<p>The last time he was in this position, he was sent flying off into LAEO, but he didn't expect such niceties this time around. He and his tethra were defeated, fair and square, and it was their duty, however much they hated it, to become this wild human's pokemon.<p>Just to note, so much time had passed since the human's changing of the custom that now even the pokemon had evolved rules about such engagements with the humans. It now was a matter of honor within a clan to serve under the one who defeats them. If they do not, they lose face within that clan and in general pokemon society. Such rules ain't pretty, but it helps make the world go round.<p>The tethra also groaned at its foreseen fate and resigned itself to general servitude. It hoped that its new master would not be one of the humans that the elders warned all little pokemon about. The chances were slim that this pig-tailed one was a bad apple, and it was also in his favor that the Meowth did not seem to mind being his companion. Perhaps there might even be something to learn of from the raven-haired human since he was able to beat the both of them.<p>The tethra also wanted to know how he could absorb all of their electrical attacks like that. And the blue lighting! That would be kinda cool to know, too. It had certainly hurt enough to be on the receiving end.<p>With these thoughts running through both electrical pokemon, they were suitably astounded when their new master kept looking at them with a suitably frightening expression and poking them with a large stick. His words also were surprising.<p>"Now I don't know about what is going on through your little minds, but if you have any sense at all, you'll steer clear of Dian and me. If you EVER come back here with the intention of hurting him, I'll send you off to meet your maker, ya got it?"<p>Eyes wide, and equipped with these instructions, the two electabuzzes gingerly got to their feet and limped off of the meadow. They would be back the next day, when they were a little more healed, in preparation for their training. After all, their master had said that they had better not come by with the intent to hurt the Meowth, not to not come back at all.<p>As soon as they were out of sight, Ranma went back to the camp and settled in to wait for Dian's recovery. He had a few questions to put to the injured feline, and topmost was what the heck his attackers were!<p>The rest of the morning had passed before Dian began surfacing from the comforting embrace of Morpheus. Ranma was right there by his side helping the little cat take in food, water, and medicine before settling back and giving his friend an appraising eye.<p>"All right, buddy...I know you know some things about what's going on, and I know that you are making rudimentary headway into being able to speak so that I can understand you. This means that I want to know about what happened out there this morning. Why did you try to get in the way of a fight?"<p>The Meowth looked somewhat abashed, and somewhat rebellious. He still was not very far along on the vocal abilities, but gestures and sound effects can go a very long way in getting your meaning across. "Rrrrah..Rrahnnnma." Dian gestured with a weakly extended claw. "Meowth . .fight ..fhor . Rahnma."<p>Perplexed is an understatement for our protagonist.<p>"Whatever for? Dian, you know that I can fight! I was just trying to get them things to leave me alone!"<p>Now confusion settles on feline features. "Why?" Dian then imitates a weak, huddling Ranma. "Oh! I was just trying to make them believe that I was scared so that they would go away without totally screwing up my ki channels. The last time that I was shocked by one of those thingies, my ki reserves went haywire, and it took the entire day in the neko ken in order to get them back to  least a semblance of normal. Now I have too much ki, and its harder to control."<p>Arched Meowth brow greets this statement.<p>"Well, Dian, you may not have noticed it, but this entire time we've been making camp and working out, I've had to keep an extra tight hold on all of my ki. If I relax it for a second.-"<p>To demonstrate, Ranma does just that, relaxes his hold, and a tight corona of ethereal blue energies is emitted from his skin and bath the shelter in coruscating waves of blue. Every few seconds, a tendril of lighter blue electricity would creep across his form, traveling from limb to limb and even arcing between his fingers and hands when he held them close together.<p>"Its gotten easier to control after this weeks worth of training, but when I get mad, like I did with those yellow thingies, this stuff is released, and a lot more potent to my enemies. I don't want to be the one to kill things. I had to do that once already, and it made no difference in the person who I was trying to save. I don't want to kill by accident at any cost. So I want to know what those things were, exactly."<p>Dian lies back on his pallet and tries to explain what an electabuz is. The gist of what Ranma got was that electabuzzes were basically a gruff blustery species and did not have any hesitations in frying anything that got in their way. Electabuz were also a prideful, clannish sort. Since Ranma's first encounter with the sparking pokemon, he was slated for an act of retaliation which he had just endured.<p>The display that had just occurred was a test to see just where Ranma stood in the pokemon hierarchy. Since he had won that match, and not using Dian in the battle, Ranma was now thought of as a rather fierce pokemon, for all that he was human.<p>Dian also knew that the tethra would also be back with or without the smaller electabuz to 'submit' to its new master. Why he kept this information quiet? He wanted to see how Ranma would react to other pokemon in close quarters, and how he would go about training such creatures that had an affinity toward what his aura could project. Besides, it's not much the cat could do lying here fried to a crisp.<p>Of course he did not want anyone to horn in on his time with Ranma. As soon as his strength was back and perhaps a little more training, Dian would take care of those two nuisances, with a little payback as well. There's no way he would let that upstart of a pokemon get the better of him with only a stray lightning bolt. He was Dian! Once pentethra of the Plainsmeadow pride.<p>One could almost see the Meowth stiffen in pride and self-importance. It is no mistake that this little cat had a big ego. He pretty much had a right to his arrogance. Being a pentethra is no small thing either. If a tethra is considered "the strongest of a population", then a pentethra is the "next to strongest". In this case, with a two evolution species of pokemon, Dian was the strongest of the Meowths in the pride, while the real tethra was a Persian.<p>The day passes with much rest and relaxation for Dian, but Ranma starts to get a little cabin fever. It's just not good to have pent up energies, especially since those electabuzzes have jumped his ki channels AGAIN.<p>*Authors Note* Heh, sorry but I really am going to end this chapter after only one additional paragraph. For my next one, I'm going to jump ahead in the future a bit. At the moment, inspiration about what is to happen just after the electabuz defeat is just not coming to me.<p>I'll get around to it eventually, but right now, I'm working where my muse takes me. Oh, and I wouldn't mind some suggestions of names for Ranma's pokemon. Look to the next chapter's Authors notes for what species they will be. I have two names already decided, but could use help on the others if ppl out there are interested. Thanks.<p>Several of the options suggested to me were the following:<p>Evee - If I were to do this one, I think I would go for Umbreon, just cause it looks 't you see this fierce looking tyke on Ranma's shoulder vying for his attention with Dian?<p>Ditto - hmm, not too sure about this. It seems like a cop-out. Sure its flexible, and very adaptable, but to write in a ditto would take a lot more knowledge and maturity than I readily have. I'm just not experienced enough to use this pokemon without seeming shallow.<p>Rapidash - actually a very good choice, symbolic without being ostentatious. But, unfortunately, its already been done by the very capable Nyugen. I dare not trespass on his ideas too much. This idea is too him.<p>Blastoise - I have never thought too much of this pokemon for unknown reasons. Really. It's probably a very good choice, but I can't get around how SLOW such a creature is. Such a creature is huge and cumbersome. Its pre-evolved form, however, I might take into  has been done to death with Ash Ketchup..er..um, but Wartortle has only been given a cameo as far as I've seen.<p>Abra - psychic pokemon are a relative unknown for me. Like a reviewer once said, Ranma does not have that much of a solid base in the mental arts. He is more attuned to the physical and perhaps spiritual. If I were to go with such a cute pokemon, then I'd probably take the reviewer's advice and investigate the Soul of Ice route. It seems sufficiently intriguing enough to open venues into the mental arena.<p>Kadabra - see above, but with a little more mature twist<p>Eggs of dead or unknown pokemon - a possibility, but been done before, and not too well by some other authors. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think about doing something so clichéd.<p>Meowth - Persian - something previously unknown - personally, this has been the closest guess to what I've been planning. Maybe not the electric cat thing, (then again, that is a really really good idea, since Ranma seems to have a MYSTERIOUS affinity towards electricity..) but Dian evolving into a Persian is well within my sights.<p>Nidoran - Nidorino - Nidoking - I do not know too much about this line of pokemon. It rather seems to be along the lines of the Blastoise when I think of them..large, cumbersome, and not altogether useful, but I could be wrong. If someone were to provide details about this line, then I might venture a scene or two or three with them. Does anyone know if they can be found in a forest habitat?<p>Poliwag - These little buggers are cute, slimy, and could provide several good plot points. I will have to think more upon this idea.<p>Clefable - You really hate me, don't you?
