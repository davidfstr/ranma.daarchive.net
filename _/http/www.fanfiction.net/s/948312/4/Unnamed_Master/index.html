</div>Whoo hoo! I am insane! I was so declared by an erstwhile reviewer who said I should burn in hell for crossing these two series. Yippee! It so gratifies me when what I said in my first disclaimer is confirmed by those who read my work...well, at least only the first chapter. Said reviewer apparently never got beyond ch. 1.<p>Anyway, the show must go on, and I'm sorry for apparently lying about a new character appearing in the last chapter. Did I mention that it wasn't completely finished when I had to upload it? No? Well, I needed the disk space for a homework project, and I could not just delete the entire chapter, now could I? So's I put it up there, and a new chappie was born. Hopefully, this one will be longer. I don't relish short chapters from other authors either. I'll try, I really will.<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 4 (I think)<p>The camp was looking a little more put together these three weeks that they had lived there. Approaching it from the west side from the river, the soaked figure of the red headed trainer took all of the usual routes that Dian and Ranma usually traversed and added further proof to the feline that the girl really was the one he trusted with his training regimen and friendship.<p>With neither of the loping figures making a sound in the sparse underbrush of the scenic forest, wildlife and animated plant life went on as usual around the two. It looked as though flashes and blurs of a bare-chested human and the tannish shadow were all that could be seen of the enigmas of the forest.<p>The word that was going around was that the human was not one of those dreaded pokemon trainers, and did not seek to capture anyone, but it was rumored that it was not above hunting, or defending of its perceived territory. None but the strongest of the forest inhabitants dared to cross paths with the wild human, and all who sought to challenge him came away defeated.<p>When the defeated tried to submit to the human, they were driven away by an inhumanly powerful Meowth after a few days. What was astonishing about those days was the fact that the human took over the defeated pokemon's training. This was expected, of course, but the degree at which their power levels rose was phenomenal. When it seemed that the downed pokemon started to get attached to the human, the Meowth would take exception, and the human would be firm, but nice about making them leave.<p>General consensus of the different populations was that this human, this unnamed trainer was a resource they would not let go easily. Among the electabuzzes, his presence was already becoming a legend, the one human that could take a zap and return it ten-fold, with burning blue eyes and wild blue electricity. The human's camp was declared a training area for all pokemon wishing to try their skills, and a suitable place to hone their specialized techniques under a skillful trainer without the subjugation of a pokeball.<p>Dian knew this, of course. He had conversation with several of the 'strongest of the population' after they had been defeated by his friend. From his point of view, after the first week of relative peace, when they were just getting settled and used to the training regimen, random attacks were perpetuated against his Ranma when the cat was not there to battle on his behalf. So far, he hadn't once been able to take the fight for Ranma, and he was itching to try out his skills.<p>As it happened, the first of these attacks occurred two weeks ago, when he was out stalking a pidgey two miles away from base. Dian's ears flicked around as a frighteningly loud yell sounded out from the direction of camp.<p>Quickly abandoning the chase, Dian leapt through the underbrush, pushing off of tree trunks to gain speed like a maddened ping pong ball to get to Ranma's side. He was sure that Ranma would not be able to stand a chance against some of the fiercer elements of the forest without him to battle in his stead. After all, it was the pokemon's right and privilege to protect what was his, and Ranma's friendship certainly numbered among the best things that Meowth had.<p>When he arrived at the training meadow, panting a little, his eyes widened with shock (no pun intended) at what he saw.<p>The feline's trainer was getting shocked by two of the strongest electabuzzes that were said to inhabit the forest. He could only assume that the first one that his trainer had encountered had gone to its clan or group and gotten the support of its 'tethra', or strongest of the population. Now it was back for its revenge.<p>Yowling a war cry, Dian pounced straight at the back of the bigger striped creature in an attempt to get it to stop electrocuting his trainer. The smaller of the opponents saw the motion, and turned one of the lightning bolts aside to take care of the feline. Unfortunately, Dian could not turn aside in time, and was fried within an inch of his life. He could only lie there, crisping on the ground and watch as his friend was subjected to bolt after bolt of electricity.<p>Ranma was becoming a little peeved. He had thought at first that if he appeared to be frightened and hurt, then the two annoyances would go away without messing with his ki. Now it seemed that they were more interested with killing him than in humiliating him. Well, since cringing and crying out in assumed pain did not work, it was on to the plan B; intimidating the hell out of them in hopes that they leave him alone.<p>Ranma had just gotten out of his crouch in order to face his two adversaries when he saw Dian get fried by an errant bolt of electricity. His face went hard and still. Another zap hit him in the chest and sparked twin flames in his ethereal blue eyes. This was the kind of thing he had trained for the past week to stop. He was strong so that those around him would not get hurt, and these two yellow striped pokemon were now on his list.<p>No one hurt his friends, and Dian was the only one he had on this world, so protecting him was of the utmost importance.<p>A rumbling growl vibrated his throat, and his eyes narrowed at the two in front of him as his fingers flexed. Shimmering claws seemed to grow from his fingertips and flashed blue each time they were extended. Electricity was crawling along his form, much like the first time he met with the smaller electabuz.<p>Ranma released his battle aura, and was sucked into the electrical charges that emitted from his body. The turned from yellow to blue, and the closer they were to his skin, the whiter they became. Surrounded by a halo of bluish crackling energy, he must have looked like a doomsday figure of legend because the smaller electabuz froze in fear, and the larger one produced a sweat drop and poured on the juice.<p>Ranma shifted into a stance, and then disappeared from sight. He did not employ the Umisenken, but rather, moved too fast for the electabuzzes to see him. The only thing they knew was that as soon as the human disappeared, immense amounts of pain erupted from their abused skin.<p>Ranma reappeared a few yards off to the right, still crackling with energy as he cupped his hands by his waist.<p>The smaller electabuz knew what was coming next, and could only brace itself, since the pain would not let him run away. The human's blue energies again moved along his arms into the space made by his hands as they were brought to the front of his body. Splitting the ball of electricity was mere child's play so that both hands had a ball the size of a grapefruit.<p>These he extended towards his opponents and willed into flight. "Double Lighting Moko Takabisha," he said, and they elongated into massive lightning bolts before frying the heck out of the electabuzzes. The only difference between this encounter and the last, was the fact that they were not sent flying. Instead, they were embedded into the ground of the meadow and were left to their own devices as Ranma charged past them towards his downed companion.<p>Gently, he picked up Dian and made his way back to their unfinished camp site. The main lodge under the halved tree was mostly finished except for chinking the open spots with clay, and would make for an excellent emergency hospital.<p>Ranma went about making his friend comfortable, laying him on the pallet of boughs of soft pine before making his way back into the forest for a patch of healing herbs he had noted on previous exploratory trips. One never knew when there might be an accident, and Ranma had made sure to get Dian's approval of herbs that could help the feline. Not all human medicines were applicable for pokemon, but most of them were. Dian had also shown Ranma which plants were useful only to pokemon and not humans.<p>After cutting various snippets of the useful vegetation, Ranma rushed back to his lodgings and went about mashing the herbs in a carved wooden bowl with a smooth river worn rock he had found that was in just the right shape for a pestle.<p>The poultice was then gently applied to the crispy skin and charred fur with the minimum of pain. This was Ranma's chance of repaying his friend for watching over him when he was knocked out.<p>The Meowth was just barely conscious throughout these ministrations, and was able to take in the offered water that Ranma held out to him. Dian felt somewhat humiliated that he could not even protect his trainer in the first battle they had together. For all of his years in his family's hierarchy, just one shot from an electabuz was enough to put him out of the game. When Ranma and he first met, the only reason he was able to hold his own was because Ranma had fought like a cat, and was not too malevolent in his attentions. Neko-Ranma just thought of Dian as a nuisance, and so did not go all out.<p>Dian lowered his eyelids in an effort to mask his feelings in front of his trainer. He felt that he had not lived up to his potential even after all that Ranma had done to help raise his skill. Ranma, of course, saw this change in his friend and hastened to assure him that he felt to ill will towards the cat.<p>"Don't worry," he soothed. "No one can be expected to jump out of the way of electricity after only a weeks worth of training. You were also committed to your jump, in mid-air when the thing shot at you, and you couldn't turn aside. We'll work on that when you are well, if you want to.  I can also understand if you want to go on with your life. I was unable to protect you. I should have been able to prevent that.." Ranma himself was a little depressed. He may have saved the feline, but he was not able to save him the pain of being electrocuted.<p>Dian placed a charred paw against Ranma's nearby hand. He was somewhat amazed that the both of them had similar thoughts running through their heads. Each had expected to have to fight for the other. It seemed that Ranma did not know that in this land, it was custom for the pokemon to fight other pokemon.<p>When humans were added to the equation, pokemon usually fought to protect those that held their friendships, but over time, the humans had changed the custom. Instead of mutually seeking the other out, humans would go out and capture pokemon, only to make friends with them afterwards..usually. Sometimes, the captured pokemon would be caught by an abusive human, and had to undergo torture in the name of training. This is what all pokemon sought to escape, and why so many of the wild ones this far out in the woods were mistrustful of humans. They had heard too many stories of the bad apples.<p>*A.N* I just had a thought..what other kinds of pokemon would ya'll rather see Ranma end up with? Personally, I have one or two already picked out, and I've discarded the idea of Raikou (or however the name is spelled), but I wouldn't mind some other opinions. I'd also be willing to put in some pokemon that are not the usual ones. A pikachu is definitely not one I'd use, mostly because everyone already does. P.S. I know some ppl hate the fact that I put these author's notes in here, but some thoughts do not wait until the end of the chapter. I have a habit of losing them unless written down. Oh, wait, I notice that there is over 2000 words in this chappie, and I feel safe in ending it on this note.<p>I'd also like to say that in the story's time line, we are still at the point where Dian just finds out about Ranma's aquatransexuality. The rest of the chapter is just a recap of some of those three weeks of training, and some pertinent events that should be noted.<p>Hint: the electabuz also come into play later, so keep and eye on them.
