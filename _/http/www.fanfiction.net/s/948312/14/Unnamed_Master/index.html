</div>Enter the Lion's Den<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 14<p>"Welcome, young man, to the village of the Cotann Amazons."<p>Well, we readers can understandably recognize why the most feared human of the Shade forests went through several interesting colors on his way to pale white and emitted an inaudible 'eep'.<p>It took a swipe from Dian's raspy tongue across an ear to bring Ranma out of his horrified stupor. The trainer shivered, as memories of the troubles he had to undergo at the hands of Amazons swept through his mind.<p>The raven haired male blinked back any further reaction as he realized that there was a slim chance of getting out of this alive, unmarried, and unchased.<p>During this split second, the matriarch before him analyzed, weighed, and assumed. All of which brought her to the wrong conclusion, as the probability of anyone guessing where Ranma actually came from was slim to none.<p>Hmm. This boy may make an okay addition to the tribe. It is evident from his lack of trainer's equipment that he is no professional trainer. However, to negate that, the boy has managed to gain the trust and obedience of a Meowth, a rather independent species not known for working well under a human's rule.<p>His movements are quick and efficient, reminiscent of what the ancients tell of martial arts. Perhaps he knows of some unarmed combat which he could teach here. Goddess knows we rely too much on the pokemon and the weapon's arts. Too bad I don't have a granddaughter or a great- granddaughter.<p>The clothes show some signs of wear, so he must be active, and that rucksack he carries looks to be homemade. Either he likes to create his own gear, or by the looks of it, he ran away from home. That seems most likely, as his hair looks to be hacked off and left to grow unruly. Well, let's see what he wants, and how I can turn this to the benefit of the tribe.<p>This the matriarch thought while the boy was regaining a hold on his composure. The Meowth he carried kept an unblinking gaze on the elder watching for any sudden movements.<p>When the male looked up into the crone's eyes, she was struck with the pure blueness of his gaze, almost making her heart flutter at its intensity.<p>My. What a direct person you are.<p>When he spoke, it was with an accent from the Far East lands to go along with his facial structure. And by east, she means beyond the League and Jhoto regions. Whatever was he doing here in Amazon country?<p>"Ano, good morning elder."<p>Elder huh. Does that mean he knows of our people, or just a term of address for an old woman he doesn't want to offend?<p>"And to you, young man. Tell me, what brings you to our peaceful village?"<p>Was it her, or did his Meowth just snort derisively?<p>The male fidgeted. His pointer fingers tapped together in a nervous gesture that was most endearing to the watching young females.<p>"I, uh, was told by someone in the know that there were humans- I mean people around here. I was hoping to be able to make contact and perhaps trade a little."<p>"Well sonny-boy," she said, noticing a wince at that term, "You have indeed made contact. Will you follow me to the visitor's center where we might have a cup of tea? We can negotiate trade or traveler's rights there."<p>Behind her back where the male could not see, the Elder signaled to the watching crowd to disperse to their normal duties, but be ready for a challenge match.<p>When the watchers went about their business, Ranma relaxed minutely. Dian only followed when a little girl no older than 7 strode to the edge of the Growlithe pack and whistled a sharp note. Her call sent the puppies scrambling over themselves to return to guard duty.<p>Ranma turned his attention back to the Elder, who headed over to a large clean building near the edge of the village grounds. Following her, Ranma also made a signal behind his back.<p>Out in the bushes, keeping a wary eye on all of the village proceedings, Pio sighed with an air of momentary content as Ranma let her know things were going alright for now, but to be ready if things turned hostile.<p>The cat and boy entered the visitor's complex and were directed to an open cushioned booth in a lounge. The lounge was located just to the right of the lobby foyer and looked to accommodate fifteen to twenty people comfortably.<p>The feral trainer kept looking around with a mixture of awe and wariness that the Elder was reminded of a wild pokemon. What was it about the situation that made him uneasy? It was almost as if he knew that he was going to be challenged and married as soon as he stepped back out of this neutral territory. Hmm, something to think about.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Ranma could feel the prickling of the hairs on his nape. He just knew what was coming next. Every halfway civilized Amazon village made the pretext of welcoming a young strong male outsider when he visited, but as soon as the niceties were over, that's when the females would strike. Oh yes, right after he acquitted himself of the visitor's center, then the challenges and brawling would begin. And if he had the bad luck to drop one of the chicks, Nerima would start all over again.<p>"Well now. If we may get the introductions out of the way, I believe that we can then proceed to the matter of trade."<p>At his silent nod, the Elder took it upon herself to continue.<p>"My name is Jigs Aw, and I am the second elder behind the matriarch of this village. The matriarch is my older sister Bands Aw. Like I said before, we are called the Cotann in this Amazon nation."<p>And when she paused expectantly, Ranma spoke up.<p>"It is very *cough* good to meet you, Elder Jigs Aw. My name is Ranma. Sorry about the unexpected arrival in your village. I, uh, didn't mean to make such a fuss."<p>Hmm, enough with this hemming and hawing. Time to get to the point.<p>"Very nice to meet you as well, Ranma. So I take it you came from the south?"<p>His eyes darted to the Meowth's for a split second before centering back on her own.<p>"Yes, ma'am, I did, and I think I have some items that I could trade here at the village..." he trailed off in an obvious attempt to divert the subject.<p>Hiding a smirk, Jigs Aw, allowed the change of topic.<p>"Of course, child. Let me see what you have to offer."<p>The feral trainer suppressed a sigh of relief and leaned over in his chair to access his rucksack, which the Meowth had carted to within reach.<p>At first, the Elder thought nothing of that small feat, but when the male, this Ranma started pulling beautifully carved stones and wares that weighed quite a lot, she had to hastily revise her assumption. That feline had moved the obviously heavy pack with such ease, that the creamy fur just had to hide an inner strength that was previously unknown in such a small frame.<p>Not only that, but Ranma had apparently carried this pack with him from wherever he had come from. He too, must have an uncommon stamina. The younger women from the tribe would be most pleased. It was too bad she wasn't a couple of centuries younger, herself, or she would be forced to compete with this recent generation as well.<p>For some reason, Ranma felt a shiver of cold trail down his spine. Unobtrusively looking around for the cause of the chill draft, he continued to withdraw some of his arts and crafts he had made when he found himself in idleness at his camp.<p>Stonework was very simple to complete, even though he had neither chisel nor hammer. His ki claws were more than enough to carve stone, and the smooth detail work in his art just took a bit of patience with such lethal instruments.<p>He also removed from the outside pouches several yards of intricate beadwork done on leather. He knew all the hides of the animals and pokemon he had...caught, would come in handy sometime. This was the same reason why he had saved plumage and bone from his and Dian's kills. Beads were nothing more than a half hour's work with some excess wood the forest sloughed off in its own good time.<p>Ranma would never stoop to decimating his surroundings like the supply was neverending. He was from Japan. What trees they had, they took care of.<p>When he had a goodly array sorted on the table, he looked up to gauge the interest the good Elder showed in the wares, or if she was solely centered on obtaining him for the tribe.<p>A stroke of luck. She was minutely examining a small statuette he had made of Dian when he was sleeping so cutely sprawling on his back. The crone's old fingers smoothed over the silken lines of the tawny grey stone which so depicted the feline now perched on the arm of Ranma's chair.<p>Cute, she thought. And if the glare the Meowth was directing in his trainer's direction was anything to go by, the youth had done this particular piece without the cat's knowledge. Heh.<p>This was even better. Not only did the young man have untapped skills with wildly independent pokemon, he would also bring to the tribe such intricate detail work, not only in sculpting, but with the beadwork as well. His designs were foreign, slightly outlandish, and would work perfectly as an attraction to the Cotann market once word got out.<p>After all, the money to be made here would rightfully belong to the clan in whole, but more specifically to the female that would manage him. The elder never gave a thought to the male getting keeping the money for himself, or the prestige for that matter. He was marketable and marriageable goods after all.<p>Anyway, the conversation went on, and negotiations proceeded slowly, but adroitly. Getting scammed by Nabiki on a daily basis has finally come in handy. Every loophole that the Elder thought she could insert into the deal was covered and closed by Ranma who, although he lacked the finesse of someone well seasoned to this skill, nevertheless did not miss what she was trying to pull.<p>The Elder's eyes narrowed minutely after a full fifteen minutes of haggling. The boy obviously was tutored by someone else. He had already finangled market rights from her that disallowed tax excises on his goods on account that he was a single merchant, almost a peddler, and he had less than the required amount of goods under law needed for taxes.<p>Jigs Aw was not too peeved by this, for she also knew that this agreement with the youth would become void when he married into the tribe. Perhaps the daughter of the Renshah line would be suitable. She was skilled in armed battle as well as a middling aptitude with pokemon. Add to that the fact that she comes from a long line of Cotann merchants, the warrior, Crescent, would make a perfect candidate for the blue-eyed male.<p>However much her admiration in the boy rose with his trade talk, she would not budge on her offer of travel rights.<p>"Kiddo, you've got to understand. If I grant you unlimited immunity in our lands, what guarantee do we have that you will not turn on us at some point? I will not allow the clause you have stated."<p>"Aw, man! C'mon baa-san," he whined with a pleading look. "I just want a promise that I will not be attacked on your lands."<p>"Well, even that I cannot promise. There are roving teams of pokemon thieves all across the lands. We have no absolute control over their actions, and if you should be attacked by them on our lands, then our word is revoked. You would be entitled to recompense in a heavy titlement if such a thing happened. I will not agree!"<p>The youth sat back on his seat, mulling this argument over. The feline nudged his shoulder to gain the human's attention and growled something unidentifiable into the male's ear.<p>If the Elder was fanciful, she would have believed that they were conversing in a human language. Impossible, to be sure. No pokemon can talk without the aid of a psychic power, so the rumblings and consonants she was hearing was a version of the cat's own pokemon dialect. That, she could believe in.<p>Authors note: You know, I think I'll keep in theme with the pokemon world and what I've started with the Cotann Amazons. That means there will be villages named Sinne, Cosinne, Tann, Hypt, Opp, and Adj.<p>Names of individual Amazons will be taken from things found in a garage, instead of a bathroom. So no Cologne or Shampoo. I present the Aw family:  Bands Aw, Jigs Aw, Scrolls Aw, Hacks Aw etc. May I also introduce the Cotann's three best warriors: Crescent Renshah, Needle Pliarah, and Box Cuttar, who will all get to know Ranma pretty well by this story's end.
