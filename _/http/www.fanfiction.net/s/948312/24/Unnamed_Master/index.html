</div><p>A.N. trembles in fear I never knew interactions with reviewers could be so scary. They can be frighteningly enthusiastic/intense, frighteningly accurate, or frighteningly st...er, interesting. Heheh...</p><p>Please don't beat up on your friendly updating author. Its never conducive toward frequent updates. As I said in a prior chapter...Waaa-aaay long ago, I will note the revisions I need to make, but will save them for a rewrite after I've finished the fic. I've got a latent obsessive-compulsive disorder just waiting to surface and if I start revising now... Just picture a barren wasteland of the updating realm. We don't want that now do we?</p><p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 24</p><p>It took some really fancy footwork and some kawaii masculine hemming and hawing, but Ranma finally made it out of the clutches of the stone seller Molly, her Very Honored Mother Dolly, and another wrinkly old hag with pursed prune lips who insisted she be called 'Auntie'. Hours after his escape, Ranma still shivered at the look in those deep set cataract ridden eyes. 'Auntie' felt like a feminine version of Happousai.</p><p>The jittered male had hot-footed it out of the village. No one had stopped him, but a great many sets of feminine eyes were boring into his back the entire way. Ranma did find it humorous, though, when he accidentally made eye contact with his grouchy would-be tax collector. The thick-waisted brunette was in the middle of a crowd of fellow tax-collectors regaling them with a much edited version of 'the one who got away', when the subject of her tale passed within ten feet of her group.</p><p>Many of her co-workers pestered her for the rest of her story, when she froze mid-word for a few seconds. That soon erupted into a flurry of useless hand waving as the storyteller collapsed into another faint.</p><p>By that time, Ranma had exited the intersection, and the only one of his group to witness her humiliation was Pio who was perched looking over her human's shoulder. Ranma's newest lil Fuzzy and Dian both exchanged looks and shivers at the malicious snickers erupting from the other shoulder. The Evee just burrowed further into their human's embrace where Ranma had him tucked like a football. Anything to hide from the crazy one.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Many hours later, the Feral one and his companions descended one last hill that finally hid Cotann village from sight.<p>Ranma was thinking about what all he had to accomplish when they got back to his new home. There were classes to reschedule, supplies he had to restock and plans to make for further expansion and permanent construction of his forest dwellings. While completely absorbed in these mental drawingboard sessions, he missed an interesting conversation amongst his pokemon.</p><p><i>Come on, please?</i></p><p><i>No.</i></p><p><i>Why not?</i></p><p><i>Because Ranma accepted him as a fellow companion... As much as I want to get rid of the pest...</i></p><p><i>I can do that.</i></p><p><i>I know.</i></p><p><i>And just think of Him clothed in red.</i></p><p><i>Eh? You're the one who wants to see him in your color. Personally, even though he'd pose a magnificent image in cream and gold, it wouldn't be practical for our habitation.</i></p><p><i>But life waters make such a good dye! After a few stretchings it wouldn't even chafe! </i></p><p>The original two voices were silenced as the third piped up.</p><p><i>I can hear you, you know...</i></p><p>"Wow, guys. You're sure getting along well. Its all quiet now."</p><p>Guess who also spoke up at the wrong time? Or is it the right time, as there was no imminent bloodshed bestowed upon the third party?</p><p>Ranma noted the pause and a small wrinkle formed between his brows. Outside of a combat situation, it took him just a tad longer with a bit more concentration to pick up social interactions. In essence, though, the martial artist ended up dismissing it. The subtle recurring hostilities weren't something he could combat at the moment, and the group's dynamics needed to be hashed out amongst themselves. While Ranma still was working on his overweening arrogance, even he did not think he could just arbitrarily impose his will on his friends and expect everything to turn out peachy.</p><p>Unknown to their mutual human companion, each of the pokemon took notice of his momentarily disapproving expression and decided to cool their tempers for the moment. That necessitated a small measure of distance between the oft clashing personalities.</p><p>Pio took the lead, both scouting and foraging for the group. She was probably the most prone to violent expressions in her opinion of distaste outside of her Ranma's venue of perusal, so she required the most distance.</p><p>Dian stayed close within a few feet of their respective partner and liege. The Umbreon, however, was a few feet in front. He had been informed by the rarely united front of Dian and Pio that if he were to cause any trouble to their claimed human, well, the results were graphically described and anatomically impossible. But the glint in Pio's eye let the newbie know she would enjoy finding out how impossible it would be.</p><p>As it was, Ranma's mind turned to a new problem he had to contemplate, and it WASN'T his navel. Certainly among the highest priority was what he was going to do with his new companion. Dian and Pio <i>seemed</i> to get along with him, but there was no way to discern if the deals Ranma had set up with the various Tethra were going to hold. After all, he and the pokemon leaders were in agreement that no one be restrained as a slave or indentured servant. But wasn't he doing something similar? He might not like it, but wasn't he honor-bound to keep the evolved changer away from Cotann?</p><p>Ranma was so involved in his inner debate that his usually keen danger sense(tm) was by absolute coincidence muted just enough that he did not recognize the three trailing curious auras in the distance. As they did not pose a direct danger to him or those under his protection, the occupied maelstrom that was Ranma's mind discarded the information presented.</p><p>Thus, he was over two thirds of the way home before his stalkers slipped up. Pio, scouting around their current campsite, was the first to spot a dying ray of sunshine bounce off a blonde head foolishly cresting a nearby rise to peek at their quarry.</p><p>Her suddenly tense posture alerted Dian and Ranma simultaneously. The Umbreon could be excused for not noticing, as he was a little unconscious at the moment. Pio's version of TLC for him flirting with her was a tad bit rough for those who hadn't had the opportunity of long term training with their human companion.</p><p>(If one wanted a definitive answer, Pio felt that the only one who could best her was her Ranma. Dian posed quite well as a combative rival, and all of those unattached pokemon Ranma had been training were merely difficult challenges. As an untrained newly evolved pokemon, Pio had mentally stamped a giant 'Fresh Meat' on the Umbreon.)</p><p>So while the Dark type was laid out, Ranma felt for his other two companions with his ki-sense, tendrils of invisible energy extending until they made their connection to the different psyches that made up his non-human friends. These tendrils scanned their bio-energy, seeking the keymarks for fear, anger or pain. But finding no direct keymark to give him a clue as to Pio's caution, he shifted his attention to their surroundings. With an effort of concentration, Ranma thinned his scanning tendrils of ki until they were gossamer threads and sort of mentally <i>threw</i> them outward.</p><p>Wafting out on the currents and eddies of nature's ambient ki/chi mixture, Ranma's gossamer net latched onto those beings with a concentrated aura. The feral trainer instinctually processed and ignored his three companions, noted the two Spinarak in that tree twenty feet away, and honed in on the human sized auras just behind a hill they had traversed fifteen minutes ago.</p><p>"Hmm, it seems we got some stalkers..."</p><p>Dian took the moment to jostle Ranma with a vigorous head rub to the human's knee and retort, "Hrrmm, seems we have Captain Obvious..."</p><p><i>It must not have been too obvious, since YOU didn't sense them either, cat.</i></p><p>To which Dian merely replied with an annoyed hiss.</p><p><i>I already have dibs on a close guardianship with him. Aren't YOU slacking since you're supposed to be the one who guards from afar?</i></p><p><i>I don't do 'guarding'. I'm more of the 'I'll eat your liver and enjoy it, if HE comes to harm" type, </i>the crazy head snarled disdainfully.</p><p>And that brought twin thoughtful gazes on the pitifully unaware newbie. Dian flicked an ear in negation.</p><p><i>No. Its too soon to trust him. Ranma might not want him around either for what the thief has done.</i></p><p>Ranma, meanwhile, had come to a decision. It was by far too late to turn around and try to lose their followers. He had a promise to keep to the wild Tethra, and Ranma Sao... Ranma kept his word. So he plucked his rucksack from the ground and cradled the Umbreon in the crook of his arm. A quick subtle motion alerted those with cinnamon and tawny pelts to the breaking of camp. And then he was off!</p><p>Ranma dashed away in a ground eating lope, leaping over the scrub brush that barred entrance into the yawning dimness of the legendary Shade forest with an ethereal grace that defied most human capabilities. His autonomous companions were mere streaks of color flowing across the land before they too were swallowed up by the over arching trees. They needed only bare seconds before the three trailing Amazons realized their prey had covered over fifty yards and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Crescent had conflicting emotions roiling through her mind. She was trying to reconcile her primary image of a good-natured yet goofy male merchant, the goddess incarnate seen in the alley disposing of thieves, and this - this graceful creature that moved in the shape of a man.</p><p>"The pokemon... Odds are they know Agility... But, can a male learn pokemon moves?" Cuttar was wondering if she too could run as fast as that. She was the most driven to excel in the physical arts. Her family specialized in weapon smithing and wanted her to settle down in the trade, not go gallivanting off playing at being a warrior.</p><p>Pliah Rah was very intrigued with his pokemon. From what she had seen in the alley, they were much tougher than expected for their unevolved forms... Plus, that boy never balled them... In fact, the three Amazons had never seen the appearance of any kind of pokeball at all during their entire pursuit of the elusive male.</p><p>Regardless, they each were inflamed with the desire to locate the elusive male, and so fought their way into the wilds of Shade forest. With a heightened awareness, cognizant of the dangers the legendary gigantic woods provided, the Amazons observed a new air of expectancy from the slumbering murky depths. Something had changed the creepy old forest.</p><p>Pokemon sightings were rare, and seen only at a distance, but the occurrences all had something similar... They were all acting excited to some extent, and all faces, from all the different species were facing inward to the heart.</p><p>Crescent took this as a sign. It seemed the Goddess herself was pointing the way for Her chosen daughters to travel.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A.N. Hmm, you guys know what? I've just reread all of my past reviews in an effort to spark ideas and self-interest in continuing this fic. Lemme tell you. It worked. I've got to say that ya'll are a great bunch of reviewers, very positive for the most part, and have come up with some excellent honest critiques. The interaction with the reviews are a highlight of every update and quite possibly generate more amusement on my side of the screen than the actual story does for you all. So let me give you an Author's Kudos and very tentatively remind you that while I bow before the greatness that is Hung Nguyen and his Fist of the Pikachu, at least I update once in a while. Heh<p>Notes to self: Ranma's new hand jewelry is on the left.</p><p>He has on his power shelf three spheres as far as I remember. The spheres indicate areas/abilities he has mastered to a certain extent or something his has an affinity toward, ie the lightning. Eventually, Ranma's going to rearrange his power shelf and experiment with drawing his own connections. He'll end up with a geometric pattern or something like a spider web.</p><p>Chi/ki - this sphere is latticed with multi colors to indicate all emotion based Chi and the white lattice is the emotionless or ambient ki. To enhance his capabilities, threads can be easily drawn from the sphere and connected to parts of the body.</p><p>Neko-ken - has a permanent thread connected to Dian. Sphere colored blue and purple? And has a 'fuzzy' feel to it when touched.</p><p>Lightning - sphere is colored an erratic white edged blue. Has a permanent thread connected to the waterstone embedded in his hand. Will probably eventually connect to a water sphere so as to conduct electricity better.</p>
