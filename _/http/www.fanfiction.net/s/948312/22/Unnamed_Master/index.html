</div><p>A.N. Good God? Could you ever believe it!</p><p>I updated...</p><p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 22</p><p>The form in front of the thieves was still as predatory as when they first encountered it leaning against the wall, but something had changed. Intensified.</p><p>With the harming of the cinnamon Vulpix, Ranma had transcended mere ire for being made to look the trespasser. But seriously, what really scared Giovanni and finally knocked some sense into his erstwhile partner was the power.</p><p>Power incarnate, visible to the naked eye, and engulfing and caressing the form floating a few inches off the ground is not something you see every day.</p><p>Ranma snarled as she saw the gaze of Pio's tormenters trace her figure, only the slightest bit soothed as their eyes widened in obvious wariness at her action. Ranma could not pause in her imminent rage to take stock of her slightly changed circumstances, but she was not so far gone as to be unaware of this little fiasco's hidden observers.</p><p>Neither could she deal with them at the moment. There was some serious butt kicking that had to be done. If she couldn't get the sneaky little watchers to be quiet about what they were going to see, it was no skin off Ranma's back. She could just disappear into the forests for a few months before trying her luck again with a different village.</p><p>The waterstone throbbed from its place of embedment in her palm as she carefully placed Pio into Dian's care out of the way. A sharp glance silenced the Meowth's protests before it sounded as small bolts of electricity sparked eerily from her eyes.</p><p>Dian only gulped, glad his friend was on his side.</p><p>Giovanni took this one last chance to try and placate the irate warrior.</p><p>"Please, si- I mean ma'am. I'm sure we can come to an understanding about -"</p><p>"Perhaps, but definitely not at this time. Your little girlfriend really hurt someone under my protection. I swore never to let that happen again.  Your group is not welcome here," the redhead stated with chips of icy electricity burning through the thieves' souls.</p><p>Bringing her hands forward and slightly to the side, the martial artist cupped those deceptively dainty fingers around an invisible shape.</p><p>The ambitious thief looked to see if the changed male was going for a hidden pokeball, but his unbelieving eyes caught something else between those tensile hands.</p><p>Three shiny haired heads were in a row, jostling slightly for positioning at a crack in a fence. Blue-green hair was on the far right, blonde with blue highlights in the middle, and a dark red that looked purple in the shadows on the left.</p><p>Only an hour ago, Crescent had just finished explaining to her mother in the central market exactly why the council had to repurchase one of their most profitable businesses when she was pulled to the side with a quick yank on her arm.</p><p>"Yow!" she exclaimed, ready to draw her personal knife at this unprecedented attack.</p><p>"Shhh!" frantically whispered a familiar voice. Plia Rah, one of the trio of which Crescent was a part of waved her friend to follow before dashing off with a wild grin on her face. As the youngest, Plia Rah was able to get away with much more than Crescent or Cuttar if ever caught by the elders, so the blonde warrior maiden took the grin as mischief in the making.</p><p>When at a sufficient distance from the Renshah Goods store, the young Renshah heir dragged her friend to a stop.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"A thief! There was a thief in the market no more than an hour ago, and they haven't caught him yet."</p><p>At this news, Crescent's eyes lit up. She could see where Plia Rah was going with this. If they could catch this wily thief, perhaps it would mitigate the loss of honor that redheaded bimbo had caused with the silk department.</p><p>When the last of the dimwits faded off into the soaring distance, Ranma took the opportunity to calm herself down with a few minutes of measured breathing. She wasn't tired in the least, but the encounter tripped something within her psyche that was very much tied in with repressed emotions and her all-pervading need to protect those she cared for.</p><p>Ranma then took the opportunity to observe the damage done to the stonework in the alley.</p><p>"Er, that's not what I expected."</p><p>A slight rustle sounded from his right, and the still female warrior brought an arm up, palm exposed outward with a blooming lightning ball at the ready.</p><p>"Rranma..."</p><p>Down went the arm automatically as the familiar voice sounded out the rumbling purr of his name. The blue aura flickered once again as static lighting crept over her form, causing the red-head to frowl.  A second later, a very smug grin crept across the gamine face as the lights retreated with a ZAP! Very interesting indeed! But there were more important things at the moment that needed worrying over.</p><p>"Dian, is Pio-?"</p><p>"Alrright."</p><p>Yes you stupid chauvinistic overbearing feline. I'm just peachy. Now stop licking my fur. Its already dry and I've no wounds, which is more than I can say for you in about a second if you don't LEAVE OFF!</p><p>"Dian, she looks a little mad at you, why are you stepping on her?"</p><p>The tawny furball positively smirked before removing his restraining limb and leaping gracefully away. Just in time too, as Pio sprang up with a small tongue of fire darting out. Ranma just rolled her eyes muttering, 'sheesh' under her breath as the two obviously close friends played with each other. They were very similar to her and Ryoga. Very close friends, yes?</p><p>Since the last member of his group was hale and hearty, Ranma turned her attention on the other matters at hand. One was the watchers, who still made no attempt at emerging, and the other was what exactly it meant since she could apparently now manipulate her lightning sphere with ease. What had changed? It wasn't just because she was a girl. No, she had been splashed plenty of times before in the forest, and that last mental orb had remained stubbornly out of reach. But now?</p><p>Cerulean blue eyes closed momentarily, while the powerful mind behind them dove deeply toward the shelves of spheres. Yes, that last one had sunken into its slot, but it too had changed. A blue tether grew from it and darted out into the nebulous depths of the rest of his metaphorical body. Hmm.</p><p>Ranma reached out a metaphysical finger and TAPPED.</p><p>In the real world, Dian and Pio were treated to the sight of a humorous knee-jerk reaction in the form of Ranma's right arm clenching forward and smacking their fearless leader in the face.</p><p>Ranma went 'ACK!' and then shook his head, staring at the back of his head in bemusement. He clenched his fist. Tilted his head. Slowly, ever so cautiously, he turned the palm up and blinked at his new hand ornament.</p><p>"Well, that's something you don't see everyday..."</p><p>Indeed, it wasn't, as a crystal the size of a fifty yen piece with a startling blue hue was seamlessly entrenched in his hand. It didn't interrupt his tendons or muscles, and he could close his hand alright... But it was weird.</p><p>Bringing it closer, Ranma studied the crystal. Some shape was in the center of the stone, and if he wasn't mistaken, it looked like some distorted wave. But it was sharply crooked... Like, almost, a blue lightning bolt perhaps?</p><p>While his training partner was picking at his hand, Dian was looking around the site. Something tickled at the furthest corners of his mind.  There was something they were forgetting.</p><p>It was Pio who discovered that last lurking thing. Below a small concavity broken into the side of a building lay a haphazard bundle of akimbo limbs and large tufts of cream and white fur.</p><p>Pio yipped at the dolt to get his attention.</p><p>Stupid cat (A.N. Baka neko) get your arse in gear and tell my Ranma that there's one last fool to dispatch. Ask him if I can eat it.</p><p>A hiss of surprise was her immediate answer before Dian jumped to Ranma's shoulder, jolting him back from inspection land.</p><p>"Rranma, we go, yes? Crrazy head want eat lying shifterr fluff."</p><p>"Eh? Lying fluff?" His gaze followed his guardian's to where Pio was playfully stalking the unconscious Evee in an manner all too reminiscent of their first meeting.</p><p>"Erm, Pio, dear? Don't you think all that fur would get stuck in your pearly whites?"</p><p>Her vulpine head tilted to the side, ridiculously cute curls swishing in time with gravity, as she contemplated this.</p><p>She really wouldn't mind a little fur between the teeth, but it seemed from her Ranma's stance that he wanted the little lying furball for something else... Ooh! Perhaps he wanted a longer more drawn out revenge than simple ingestion! If she let it go now, perhaps he would allow her her own amusements.</p><p>So after all, the slightly mentally unstable pokemon barked her acquiescence and pounced up on Ranma's other shoulder, making sure to bump the rival into almost losing his perch.</p><p>Ranma only grimaced some as claws dug in, but he regained his equilibrium swiftly, as only one trained in his arts should. The one human woodland pokemon feared as the Feral One gathered all of the fallen evolution stones back into its bag before gingerly lifting the as yet knocked out Evee. An accidental nudge to its collar dislodged a brilliantly yellow winking sunstone which he deftly caught and also placed into the bag.</p><p>Heaving a small mushroom puff of a sigh, the red-headed martial artist left the alley and his watchers and made his way towards hot water and the stone-sellers stall. It was time to pay the piper, and get out of Dodge if they wouldn't see reason.</p>
