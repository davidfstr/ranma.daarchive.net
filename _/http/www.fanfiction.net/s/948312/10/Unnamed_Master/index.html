</div>Well now, it has been about three weeks since I last updated, but I have an excuse! The first two weeks were spent helping a cousin of mine whose husband is dying of cancer. She lives at a ranch, has six horses, numerous goats, five cows, three sheep, a pot-bellied pig, and a partridge in a pear tree. Oh yeah, and a three year old child. She could not care for them all at the time, so I volunteered to help.<p>Don't look at me that way. That was my slated good deed for the decade. The third week is covered by my visiting grandparents, and a great aunt who is also dying of cancer. Life sucks right now, and writing is somewhat of a catharsis, so I'll try to keep the chapters coming.<p>Correction. As I am writing this now, a week has passed and said great aunt is dead by about three days. Sorry if my work is shit right now.<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 10<p>It has been only two days since Ranma's electrical bonfire, but success still eludes the pig-tailed martial artist. The charred clearing is now Ranma's preferred training arena since everything that could be burned, already has.<p>His last two days consisted of a quick spot of hunting with Dian, an hour or two of honing claws or tactics against any pokemon challenges, and then the rest of the day is devoted to determining controls and limits for the arcs of electricity.<p>At the moment, Ranma was again at the center of the solidified slag pit as he exposed the electricity sphere from its temporary pocket in the wall of his soul.<p>Upon full exposure, Ranma lit up like a Christmas tree and although he could not feel the effects of the lightning, his skeleton showed through the glare in a blinking effect.<p>The aquatranssexual knew that at this moment there was too much energy flying around for him to get a hold of it, so he again smothered the sphere. It was only when he willed a tiny hole to open in the containment walls and only a weak tendril of light shot through, that Ranma became aware of an unfamiliar presence making its way into the perimeter of his living area.<p>Now usually, when other unfamiliar presences made themselves known, they were wild pokemon seeking to challenge or train with the wild human. Thinking that this was no different, Ranma closed the pinhole and surfaced from his meditation. Looking about his domain, Ranma padded silently yet swiftly over the barren clearing, across the all-purpose training meadow, and halted just short of the tiny cabin he shared with Dian. Just at the edge of the woods a fair sized pink Nidoran partially hid behind a large bush, waiting to see what his reception would be.<p>Dian was off in another meadow conducting a fair sized class of a mixture of different pokemon. As Ranma's second, it fell to him to continue classes in the basics of pokemon martial arts. It was also a good thing that none of the pokemon the feline was instructing were new to the partners, as each species represented in the class already had a training regimen set out.<p>Electabuzzes were to focus on losing the paunch with speed, endurance, and physical power training.<p>Pikachus were already naturally quick on their feet, but a good course in meditation proved useful so that they were able to think calmly about strategy and not let their speed overwhelm their minds. Endurance and physical power were also good traits to focus upon as well.<p>The Nidoran were some of Ranma's favorites, but don't let any of the other pokemon know that. Mass genocidal war on the Nidoran because of a subconscious jealousy is not something Ranma would have wanted. Anyway, the Nidoran intrigued Ranma mostly because this species could branch out onto two different evolutionary paths.<p>Everyone came from a base, neutral stock, but each had the ability to evolve into either a male or a female. Rather like someone else we know, right? Unlike his own unstable evolution, the Nidorans' path would eventually take them to their conclusion of rather large 2-3 ton tank-like, mouse-like dinosaurs. Ranma liked to get in on the ground training of these pretty powerful pokemon.<p>Nidoran training was a well rounded schedule with the usual speed, endurance, and physical power, but was also backed with precision training for their horns, meditation for strategy, since they were all so small and had a herding instinct, and a general herbology.<p>This last class came as a surprise to many of the Nidoran themselves, but Ranma had developed this theory. Since he got to know the habits of this particular species, he noticed that they usually ingested several different plants of a toxic origin without dire effects. If they were knowledgable about plants and their properties, then when they ate certain combinations of those plants, then their individual poisons would change in accordance.<p>A young Nidoran, a month prior took it upon himself to test out this theory by only eating a plant known for its herbal remedies. The entire clan was shocked to see that over the trial period of time, his poisons became shockingly less potent, and after the midway point, began to gain in strength in a positive direction. Instead of poisoning, he began to heal!<p>Thus, because of his gentle nature, this singular Nidoran became the first of his kind to be appointed healer, since his stings only injected medicine and once the puncture healed, only raised the overall health of the subject.<p>This may be in part why the Nidoran tethra was pleased with Ranma enough to have one of his extended family go through the trouble of acquiring and bringing to the wild trainer a set of human clothing.<p>Said random cousin was the one lurking about in the bushes around the cabin.<p>~-~-~-~-~-<p>Ranma looks from the bushes to the clearing where Dian is teaching and back again. Nah. He can handle this alone.<p>The pig-tailed teen settles down into a relaxed posture staring at the shivering bush in which the Nidoran emissary hides.<p>As the seconds stretch on, Ranma begins to become impatient, but restrains himself from showing it. He calls out to his visitor, "If you are here to challenge me, then you might as well come out. I know you're there, so you haven't the element of surprise."<p>And then with a moment's thought, "And I won't forget about you either, if that's what you're hoping for."<p>A few more seconds pass in debating silence. A pink horn emerges from the foliage, followed by a small domed head adorned with large pink spiky ears.  Blinking slowly at the change in light, the emissary steps fully out into the light of the cabin clearing.<p>Turning around abruptly, the mutated bunny drags out a large durable leaf by its stem. Although Ranma is getting used to weird looking animals doing things he would expect of humans, what he saw on the leaf sledge blew his mind out of the water.<p>For rolled up into a haphazard bundle on the leaf was an assortment of cloth that he could only conclude as human make. It was clothes.<p>Completely bypassing his normal thought processes, Ranma used a minor bit of his newfound speed to cross the distance between them and scramble through the clothing. To the Nidoran, though, the purportedly dangerous human had disappeared and reappeared altogether way too close for comfort.<p>Teleportation, it thought, as it jumped back reflexively. It would have to report this to the tethra. Passive studies were being made about this trainer, and some of the theories that came to light were both humorous and disturbing. This new fact might tip the scales.<p>Ranma's hands blurred as he set out the articles of clothing on the ground.  One child sized sock, a shimmery black woman's blouse not large enough to house his feminine attributes, a green cotton T-shirt a size too large, but still usable, a brown skirt that either came to Ranma-chan's mid-calf or two inches above Ranma-kun's knees. No shorts. No pants.<p>"What a haul," he whispered to himself.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>And somewhere out there in the normal multiverse, a bandana clad imp in a purple gi carrying a load of women's underthings gave one HECK of a sneeze, thus allowing the vengeful viragos to catch up and let loose one helluva beat down.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Meanwhile, in Ranma's mind, thought-processes went something like this:<p>Clothes! Some might fit...sock might be used as a pouch for stuff, blech, blouse is not suitable, but I like the color and the material. Perhaps if I cut off the lapels and the sleeves, I can use it as a vest...T-shirt's good, but the skirt? No way, no how will I wear a skirt as a guy, and I'm not staying a girl in order to wear it.  arts sewing, I already have the wooden needle. Some of the black thread from the sleeves. This might work! Ha, no more grass loincloth itch.<p>With Ranma completely forgetting about the emissary, the guy who was sorely in need of clothes blurred into movement as this scene closes, all the while grinning at his good fortune.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>Some time later, Dian gives the class a break and they all troop back to the cabin for snacks, drinks and relaxation time. Now that both Ranma and Dian fight and train with the wild pokemon, they have considerably less time to go hunting.<p>When the other pokemon noticed that their quality time with their personal fitness trainer lagged when he had to go out and restock his food supply, several of his pupils took it upon themselves to bring back a portion of their own daily findings.<p>Several, meaning nearly every pokemon that comes for training will bring a gift of some sort, usually resulting in a surplus of stored food. That is why Ranma feels it is okay to pass out snacks to his students.<p>Anyway, when Dian approached the cabin, he was startled at the excited tension emanating from within their abode. Backpedaling a step or two, the feline paused in a ready stance as his partner exited the doorframe dramatically and posed before his assembled audience.<p>One can almost imagine the wind blowing tumbleweed through the tableaux, it was so quiet.<p>An anonymous cricket chirruped, and was eaten by a passing pokemon.<p>"What?" Ranma asked exasperated.<p>Dian moved forward and touched a paw to the brown knee length shorts sewn finely because of an esoteric martial arts technique. His eyes traveled from the neatly hemmed black vest, to the loose fitting forest green shirt and back to the brown skirt-now shorts. Dian could just picture Ranma in his girl form with the shorts becoming loose capris.<p>"Good look," the feline rumbled. "Odd pose," he continued. "Wherrrre did Rrranma get?"<p>Ranma's mouth, all open to proclaim his greatness at getting clothing, fell upon the realization that he had no idea where that pesky mutant bunny actually got the clothes.<p>"Yanno what, Dian? I'm not too sure, but I have something better than just good clothes."<p>The Meowth's head tilted to the side curiously, his entire form the embodiment of feline 'What?'<p>"These clothes are the proof that there actually are humans out here in the world. I just have to go and find them."<p>Dian sighed a mushroom puff, gestured for his powerful partner to come closer to him, and whacked him upside the back of the head.<p>Ranma jumps away from the minor blow to his ego, brows furled in annoyance.  "Whatcha do that for?"<p>"Rranma not know morre humans herre?"<p>"Of course not! You never told me that there were any!"<p>"Baka! Rranma neverr ask."<p>*grumble grumble grumble*<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Later that night, as Ranma cozied up in his fur blankets with Dian at his back, he asked a question that had been nagging him since their confrontation.<p>"Ey Dian?"<p>"Meh?" the cat replied in place of the human's 'wha?'<p>"Where do ya suppose we can go looking for more people?"<p>Dian leaned over to place his face nose to nose with his friend. "Rranma want find otherr human?"<p>Ranma thought about this for a bit. "Yeah. I guess so. I wanna know what they're like in this world. Could I fit in with them, should I, in fact."<p>More silence, as Dian lets his friend think things through.<p>Ranma continues, "I've been alone quite a bit in my life. My father and I have always traveled up until the last few years. These four months have been the longest I've been in one place, aside from staying at the Tendo's."<p>Dian's eyes glinted in the firelight. "Rranma have home herre. With Dian.  With trraining. Rranma make forest home, but if want to trravel, Dian also therre."<p>Wiping away a slight moisture from his eyes, Ranma hugged the warm body before settling into a more comfortable position for sleep.<p>"Let's try to the south, Dian. The river flows in that direction, and people generally build on rivers."<p>Dian patted the homesick human on the shoulder, curled around a couple of times to find the right spot, and laid back down, resting his furry side along his partner's back and went to sleep.<p>*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_<p>That's the end of this chapter, but I have a small request from anyone who's following this timeline. I would like to know what kind of pokemon can be found in a desert area. Yes, I know that that was a big time hint, but I still need a tid bit of further research to make this somewhat believable. Please review.
