</div>See, See? I DO update...every once in a while. *Cough* Anyways, Everything will be explained, but in due time! I do not want to spoil already planned timelines or surprises. As y'all can also see, I've been taking suggestions into account, and I really like two of the names suggested for the Evee/Umbreon Ranma will get sometime in the near future.<p>Evee will come into play after two others make their entrance, so don't hold your breath. Oh, and the names I like are from two different reviewers, sorry I don't have your names in front of me at this moment, but the suggestions were either Vice, or Avalon. Since the Evee will be male, and kinda prone to kleptomania, I'm almost inclining toward Vice.<p>And changing the subject, I'm happy to announce that two very wonderful ppl have volunteered to by beta readers, for which I am most grateful. Thank you much Lorn and Garahs.<p>And on with the chapter!<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 9<p>It had been a mainly uneventful week. The Nidoran had long since kept to the peripheral, and only once had the Electabuz tethra showed up. Even then, Ranma only had a moment or two to greet his former pupil before Dian dragged the electric pokemon away.<p>What Ranma did not know was that the Electabuz was there only to finish hashing out the details of the agreement for the burgeoning training camp and the Electabuz clan.<p>All he was concerned about was the fact that training was going fairly well, and his ki abilities were starting to surprise him.<p>At first, Ranma was amused at the arcs of electricity his aura was beginning to emit, after the original encounters he had had with the Electabuzzes. Now, though, they were nagging at his mind, saying 'here we are, a technique just ready to use, if only you knew how'.<p>When he coached the tethra and the companion Electabuz, Ranma focused mainly upon getting the two into shape, and then on their electric capabilities as a secondary priority. But now he was intrigued. Before he came here, he had never done anything with electricity. It was always with heat or cold, chi for his Moko Takabisha, or using ki for the specialty techniques from the Amazons.<p>The wild human could only surmise that when the Electabuz shocked him when he burned into this world, the pokemon had changed him on a fundamental level. The pig-tailed martial artist had been at the furthest reaches of his energy limits when he was electrically assaulted, and the lightning bolts were the boost his system needed in order to adapt him to the changed environment.<p>Thus the intermittent arcs when he wasn't paying attention to his aura. What further changes his physiology would undergo, he didn't know, but for now, he had a responsibility to harness whatever power or skills his body had attained for him so that he could claim it as his own.<p>Never let it be said that Ranma did not work for the amazing abilities he had. And because he labored long and hard for each skill he possessed, anything that came to him as a free power boost seemed to cheapen the work he had put into his training. So he had to gain control over this ability.  It seemed innate now, like his healing or eyesight; both of which he could control to some degree. This too, was something to be overcome, and made to benefit himself, and those under his protection.<p>That being said, the week after the Electabuzzes had made their departure was spent in discovering the capabilities of his ki generating electricity.<p>The first day Ranma spent his morning clearing a corner of the meadow of all the things that were wont to catch on fire. Ranma did not want to go and torch his new home just because his training was a little incautious.<p>After a quick midday meal, a casual spar with Dian and his former student, the Electabuzz tethra, and a dunk in the river to wash off sweat, Ranma now stood in the center of his denuded electric training area.<p>He looked at his hands, capable of great feats of wonder, and thought of what he wanted to accomplish. Looking into his soul, Ranma willed the bonds on this strange new power to release its hold entirely. He wanted to see what he could do unfettered, in order to ascertain how he could limit himself, and temper the electricity into usefulness.<p>At first nothing happened. Undaunted, Ranma plunged still further into his light meditation, seeking the flows of his ki and chi. With his inner eye, his entire body was traced with a seam of light, pulsing with his heartbeat, and pooling at certain points, where he had previously determined that more ki was needed.<p>To Dian, and the tethra, watching from further in the meadow, the wild human looked relaxed, yet subtly ready for anything, as if he could explode into motion in any direction without warning. Again with the flickering sparks. Burning without consuming, ethereal and solid feeling, those sparks were the beginning for a full on conflagration of fire and lightning going out of control.<p>The blaze of ki lightning exploded from all angles, towering above the treeline and licking the faces of Ranma's onlookers even from their distance away. Scrambling backwards in an effort not to be scorched, Dian could only drop his jaw at the power his friend generated. This was truly a good time to be alive. With Ranma in the world, changes would happen, and Dian sure was not going to be left behind.<p>The Electabuz saw this display of energy as a sign from above. He was really glad that he had allied his clan with the human, and from all visible signs, the human would do anything in his incredible power to protect that which he was responsible for.<p>Ranma was centered and calm. Although he realized what his ki was doing outside of his body, internally a mental war was brewing. The electricity was and was not unlike his ki. This power was connected to the spiritual energy, but resisted any casual claims he put on it. Until Ranma could master it entirely, it had only two settings and one proviso. Off, On, and zap anything he aimed at when he was pissed off. Aside from those settings, this power was letting the wild human know that it would not obey any directives unless he proved himself capable, flexible, and possessing a mind that could exert a will that controlled all within him.<p>By no means fully conquering it, Ranma's expression within the globe of fire and lightning lost its calm reflection and became fierce. This was the face of Ranma Saotome when he decides that he will not lose. Can not lose, no matter what. This was what he looked like when the battle becomes all-inclusive, and he was battling himself.<p>Searching, delving, poking around in his mind for the control of this energy, Ranma dodged random whips of lightning while trying to find the mental lever or switch. Before he had done this, only the complete suppression of a vital side of himself kept the electricity from causing catastrophe. These few weeks since he had arrived in this world took a toll on him that he was unwilling to continue, so he was facing this problem now, when he had the time to seek its control.<p>The swirling energies around him grew larger, as he neared the point of mastery. Just within reach, at the limits of his mental endurance, a glittering beacon pulsed. Slightly out of rhythm from his heartbeat, that sphere sparked blue and white, the source of his strange ability. Nestled between his ki center which glowed a pulsing confident yellow and white, and a dark ovoid of purple, black and dark blue, the sparking sphere was out of alignment, out of whack, and incredibly hard to move.<p>At first, Ranma shied away from the dark sphere toward the more familiar confidence and power he usually wielded with his ki. When he laid a hand on the yellow and white ball, he could sense a further range of colors/emotions buried deep within, but overshadowed by the overbearing presence of his arrogance. That was what it was, in essence. With nothing to temper simple confidence, his mainstay power gorged itself, and was on the verge of blowing up into an arrogance that could get him killed.<p>Not only himself, but everyone else under his protection as well. That must not happen. Ranma renewed his vows upon his arrival to the world. Whatever power to help, whatever hardships to endure, he would over come this deficiency, and if it meant casting off most of his confidence, that was what he would do.<p>Gently pressing his hand downward into the ki sphere, most of the yellow submerged itself and an assortment of colors brushed along the outside wall. Ranma saw flickers of red, pink, light and dark blue, purple, green, orange, black, and mixtures of all shades. What he also saw that gave him pause, were tendrils of white latticing the other colors, and pooling at the center in a strong tiny ball of indescribable light. Stroking a finger along a tendril of that light, Ranma was bowled over with the sense of ki. Not just emotion filtered ki, but pure, and unadulterated. This was what lies at the center of life.<p>Arm still embedded to the elbow in that ki sphere, Ranma cupped that pooled warmth in his hand, and gently brought it closer to the surface. The other colors and emotions grouped together, and trailed along after it like a gaggle of baby ducks. When the edge of the pure ki met the wall of the ki sphere that contained it all, the white bled across the surface and coated the majority of the surface area.<p>The other colors found their own places to lie alongside the surface, but the white moved to encapsulate each of them before they mixed together. White became a framework, with each emotion a beautifully cut jewel.<p>Withdrawing his hand, the ki sphere settled with a contented hum into a depression created by his will to keep it from rolling around. Two more depressions arose at either side of it, empty and waiting.<p>Ranma stepped back, and looked at the two other spheres awaiting his attention. The dark ovoid was scary, but still a little familiar. The other, was the electricity, wild, untamed, and definitely unpredictable as of yet. Better to go with the one he could handle at first and get it over with.<p>Stepping up to the ovoid, Ranma's hand hovered close to the surface, allowing his mind to receive the sensation of fur rubbing alongside his palm. With only a reactionary flinch, his fingers settled upon its surface, transmitting to his brain that it seemed to vibrate minutely.<p>"Purring," he said aloud, although the word was lost in the crackle of energy that still surrounded him.<p>The ovoid somewhat reminded him of Dian, and Ranma was all right with that.<p>As if it could feel his acceptance, the purple and black colors parted along the surface to show him a hint of the white that lay at its center.<p>"Just like the ki."<p>With both hands along its side, the ovoid allowed his mind's entrance, and Ranma was struck with the sensations of cats. Felines of all shapes and sizes were interested in him for they could feel a part of the feline within. Ranma stood very still upon this realization and his mind paged back through his life to see every cat he ever came in contact with.<p>"They were all like Dian," he whispered. "Just curious to see a human with a part feline soul."<p>His thoughts turned to Dian and all of the experiences his partner had shared with him. The Meowth, himself, felt a brush along his mind, like a psychic pokemon, or a cat greeting another cat. But this brush had the mind scents of his friend. The one who tasted of male and female, wild and gentle, strength and kindness could never mean him harm, so the tawny cat reached back along that line, and greeted his fellow feline.<p>Ranma felt a 'ping' along the path that stretched between Dian and himself as the line entrenched firm hooks into accepting ground. Wondering at the rightness of this bond, Ranma returned his attention to the ovoid which had settled itself with its own unique purring hum into the depression next to the ki sphere.<p>The unnamed trainer's power surged with the newly forged link in his psyche, reflecting also in the clearing, as ki energy, and a wild feral energy were tucked back into his control, leaving only the lighting and electric sparks raging from his soul.<p>And last but not least, the blue-white sphere. Still aggravatingly out of synch with the others, Ranma could taste the point at which the power escaped his grasp. It was the farthest away from the last depression, and Ranma could tell it would take more than that afternoon to get it into grasp. Hell, it would take more than the next few days for him to understand the extent of that ability.<p>Ranma took a moment to measure the lag in his ki. He looked at the sphere to see what was wrong, and saw that it was nearly depleted, since he had been spending that resource rather recklessly over the course of the afternoon. However, what he also saw was that despite the decrease in the liquid light, the actual sphere had gained in its radius, making the capacity larger. All he needed to do now was rest up a bit, and his soul would recharge the ki until it filled its new limits.<p>Ranma looked again to the electric sphere and decided that he would not tackle such an obstacle today, since he was at the dregs of his power. Looking around the actual clearing, he knew that he could not let the blue power stay loose like this so he turned back to his inner seat of power and caused a fold of his soul to smother the electric sphere.<p>Ranma immediately felt a portion of himself fade, as if his emotions or sense of self was suppressed, as the lightning show around him started to fade. Calm was restored to the clearing, and Ranma was able to look about the destruction he had wrought on once viable land.<p>The human stood on a scorched expanse of land. Little bits of molten dirt steamed in the air as it cooled and Ranma could see that he would have a slightly hard time getting himself out of there without burning what was left of his clothes. The homemade leather shorts had faired well, but the feathers, and the woven vegetation had not.<p>The smell of burnt feathers charred the air, and made his eyes water as he thought back to the Soul of Ice. The technique worked wonders upon the immediate land as it chilled the air and the molten ground so that it hardened into glassy clumps and baked divots. Unfortunately it worked almost too well. It started to rain.<p>Ranma became Ranma-chan, water pooled where it could not find escape in the sealed cracks in the ground, and Dian and the onlooking tethra laughed their heads off at the sight of their dear very powerful friend making an ass of herself falling down on the slicked water covered surfaces.
