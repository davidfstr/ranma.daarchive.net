</div>Meanwhile... (There's always a meanwhile, isn't there?)<p>A few aisles away, a very nice stand of evolution stones were on display. In addition to the usual grass/thunder/water etc stones there were a matched set of the rare sun and moon stones. Priced exorbitantly, these celestial stones were merely on loan from a larger collection as a lure to bring in the customers.<p>And watching these stones were two pairs of eyes, for two different reasons. The sharp eyed dark haired youth wanted to acquire the celestial stones because of their enormous rarity and the good marks it would make for his record. The equally sharp eyed ball of tan and white fluff looked on the other lesser valued stones avidly with the intents to self-evolve. Maybe then his would be human trainer would appreciate the Evee as a partner, not a deficient tool.<p>Behind the two sets of calculating eyes, soft sounds of enjoyment could be heard deeper in the shadows of the alley they were hidden in. (A.N. no you hentais, not what you think)<p>Giovanni only spared a contemptuously short glance at the wonder-bargaining bimbo who was literally swimming in her cart of fine fabrics. He had no plans on including that nitwit in the soon to be commenced theft, and eyeballed the team's mascot fluff ball measuringly. Perhaps it might be useful.<p>With sharp sibilant whispers, Giovanni gave the Evee instructions.<p>"When I move out and start browsing the stalls, you pick an unaware shopping moron to follow. Act like you're that person's pokemon. Do it discretely, so he'll not notice, but so as others will pin the coming fracas on him."<p>The Evee nodded slightly. He would normally give a more enthusiastic response like he did when he first came to this team, but almost a year of experience had taught him that Giovanni paid little to no attention to the un-evolved, as long as things went in his favor.<p>But wait, no more internal musings, the brat human was going on.<p>"When you've established your 'ownership', and your mark passes the stones booth, nick one of the celestial stones as quietly as you can. When the alarm is raised, make as big a distraction as you can and high-tail it. I'll palm the other stone, and any of the lesser ones. If we get even one of the celestials, our goal is accomplished."<p>The Evee wanted to protest. Wouldn't it be better for their reputation with the organization if they brought back BOTH stones, and as many common ones as they can hold?<p>Giovanni actually caught the rebellious light in the fuzzy pokemon's eyes. Giving it a sharp cuff to the top of its head, he snapped, "Don't get greedy. It'll only get you caught, and I'll leave you to the Amazon's mercy - what little they have for thieves, that is."<p>Instantly, the Evee blanked his eyes, making them glassy and opaque, shielding his mutinous expression, but his inner turmoil had him sulking.<p>What did that stupid human know? He'd snitch both the celestials, get away with them, and then that Gio person would have to come crawling to HIM, begging his forgiveness for his prior treatment of the Evee.<p>Well, he couldn't see the stuffed shirt human doing that, but it had to make a difference in the treatment, right?<p>Before giving the signal to have the heist commence, the human gave one last look at the fuzz-ball to impress the full weight of the situation. Giovanni did not want anything chaotic to be introduced to his plan. It would all go smoothly, and the organization would have to give him a new partner. The busty bimbo was just too much for a saint's patience, let alone his.<p>As soon as Giovanni dropped his hand, the Evee was out of the alley, and darting into the crowds, off to search for the perfect dupe heading in the right direction.<p>-<p>Just as the pair of would-be thieves' luck would have it, Chaos incarnate was strolling just a short ways away from the evolution stones booth. And he had a friend.<p>Two actually. One was languidly perched upon his broad yet lithe shoulder, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd, and the other was a red furred blur, bouncing from one rooftop to the next in an effort to keep her Ranma in sight. She did not trust the idiot cat to keep her Ranma safe.<p>Her distrust might not be so much as a worry for Dian's guardian skills as a growing pang at being away from their special human's side for most of the day.<p>Perhaps somewhere deep in her subconscious, Pio was afraid that her wonderful friend would disappear like her family and siblings had if she doesn't keep an eye on him.<p>...<p>...<p>...<p>Anyway, the fates had lined the situation up so that a very intriguing clash would soon occur.<p>At first the flitting Evee just scanned the faces of the humans in the crowd. He had to find one that was not paying too much attention behind, and since these were Amazons, it would most likely have to be a guy. All the girls were warriors, and entirely too aware of their personal space to permit the following of a suspicious pokemon.<p>After deciding on a male mark, the Evee needed to further narrow things down to only those going in the right direction, paced slow enough for him to lift the correct stones.<p>Slowing down at the end of the line of stalls, the Evee noted a certain dark haired male taking his time at each of the shops, garnering him looks of both appreciation and a mixture arrogance and fear. Despite the fluff ball's appearance, he was by no means a dim bulb unlike some he had to work with cough - Carlita - cough and he could only assume this blue eyed male was an outsider to the village.<p>Mentally cackling and fluffing his fur (this is the Pokemon equivalent to Mr. Burns rubbing his hands), the Evee knew that these women would readily turn on the hapless male when they suspected him of stealing the stones. Human psychology shows that a group would blame an outsider sooner than one of their own if anything went wrong, and the way Giovanni's team planned it, things would go very wrong indeed.<p>As the Evee slinked closer to the ambling human, he almost aborted his planned mark when a second pair of eyes pinned him to the packed dirt of the path. Set in a very wary feline face, those eyes measured, assessed, and then apparently classified the fuzz ball as a non-threat.<p>The Evee hated him immediately.<p>Well, not hate, exactly. The Meowth had done nothing to him personally, but the cat irritated the hell out of him, looking down at him like that. So we can say he formed an immense dislike on sight.<p>That instant loathing clinched the strolling male as the mark , and became one of the worst, or the best, choices the Evee had ever made.<p>-<p>"Rranma," said object of animosity whispered in an attentive ear.<p>"Therre little changerr pacing us."<p>Ranma paused at a stall selling warriors clothing, running his hands over something silky, pretending to browse as he whispered back a question and glanced in a reflection to see behind him.<p>"What's a 'little changer'?"<p>The martial artist quickly catalogued the stalker's stature while his felinoid partner filled him in.<p>Built rather like Pio, their personal stalker had clean trimmed limbs, a white ruff of fur wrapping around its chest like a Collie from his old world, and a shaggy upper pelt that covered a lean torso to make it twice its size if it were shaved. Topped by a roundish head, button black nose, glittering dark moist eyes, and with perky sharp tipped mobile rabbit-like ears, the thing was too cute for words.<p>"Little changerr evolve severral ways. Most firre, waterr," and at this point, Dian gave his trainer an affectionate look to gauge his reaction, "and lightning."<p>Ranma was about to reply to the jibe at his growing reputation as some kind of electric human when he realized he was being stared at by the owner of the shop and several of her clientele. He sweatdropped when he realized that he was running his hands through WOMEN'S underthings for warriors.<p>Pulling his hands back like they were burning, Ranma made a good impression of a tomato before zipping away stammering down the line of stalls. A wave of laughter accompanied his wake by the same women in the stall.<p>When Ranma slowed down, he reached up and de-hooked Dian's claws from his hair and rubbed under the cat's chin to get him to relax after that abrupt wild ride.<p>An eye twitched in the tan-furred face with annoyance before clambering back to his place on Ranma's shoulder. Tacitly, both decided that situation would never be discussed.<p>Ever.<p>-<p>The Evee had almost lost them in their rushed departure, but they had stopped two stalls away from the evolution stones. It was time to make his move.<p>Sauntering up like he had every right to walk by this human, the Evee brushed up against the glass casement which housed the more valuable stones when the supposed trio passed. Exercising his honed skills at sleight of hand - er, paw, the Evee replaced two of the lesser stones with both of the celestial ones, and secreted the valuables about him. The Sun stone went into a carefully hidden cache in his collar, and the Moon stone went into the folds of his cheek. Long ago it had been drilled into the kleptomaniac pokemon that it did not pay to keep all your eggs in one basket.<p>The Evee kept up his pretense of belonging to the dark haired male up until the stone stallkeeper's alarm was raised. The trio had made it to a stall and a half away before pandemonium broke out with the cries of 'Thief!'<p>Instantly, everyone drew away from the outsider and his pokemon, allowing several well endowed guards to surround him with spears and menacing expressions.<p>The Evee stepped behind the trainer in an attempt to minimize the attention directed at him so that he might make a surprise attack to escalate things, but before he could do so, words spoken in a different pokemon dialect than his own accused the fuzzball.<p>'YOU!'<p>The Evee jerked his eyes away from the guards to regard the Meowth.<p>'You stole whatever it is that's got them in a rage. How dare you drag Ranma and I into your thievery!'<p>'Nyah, bite me' came the sardonic reply, while his eyes were diverted to watching Giovanni creep unnoticed toward the rest of the evolution stones. 'That's just the way the cards fall.'<p>-<p>Dian's eyes followed the Evee's gaze until they too alighted on another dark haired human. It looked as if he were going to -<p>Dian bared his teeth as he came to the realization that they were being set up.<p>The warriors surrounding them narrowed their eyes at this act of agression from the male's pokemon, seemingly at his provocation.<p>Ranma quirked an eye at the hostilities, his mind running through the mental calculations that accompanied any battle. Angles, forces, momentum, his entire repertoire of fighting moves; all of this passed through his mind, even if he was not conscious of it<p>But at the behest of his partner, Ranma focused on the one making furtive movements over the glass casement when the owner's attention was elsewhere.<p>Ranma gave one of his better battle grins at the women.<p>They could only tense as the innocent seeming male sent their senses off the scale when his smile transformed him into a predator in their midst.<p>Their Amazonian minds told them that it was only a male, and therefore no real threat, but the primal parts of their undermind screamed 'DANGER you silly asses! You're about to get your butt handed to you!'<p>Fine muscles in spear and sword wielding arms trembles at a defined and muscular arm lifted - ever so slowly.<p>Fingers that at once could pierce the strongest of metal and craft some of the most delicate work curled inward to a calloused palm leaving only the index extended. The arm swung, again very slowly, dragging the onlookers eyes with it like hypnotized birds to the direction of the stone seller's lot.<p>Caught in the act, the dark haired thief could only blink in the deer-in-the-headlights manner.<p>-<p>At first it was a low murmur, but it gathered into an outraged roar in a heartbeat. The Giovanni's eyes widened and he called out, "Evee! Swift Attack! (A.N. Is that right?)" while simultaneously pulling a pokeball from his belt.<p>The Evee jumped to the thief's side and let loose with a golden swath of starlike blades at the crowd, as the pokeball popped open and a sickly looking Squirtle appeared.<p>Intent of finding a way out of this as his team's puny unevolved pokemon swatted aside or broke all of the oncoming spears, no one noticed the dupe and his Meowth slip through the maddened crowd and make for one of the exits to the market area.<p>Giovanni's unlikely rescue came in the form of a line in the crowd as people began getting mowed down in a direct vector to where Giovanni and the pokemon were.<p>A man-powered cart came barreling through in a brown and orange blur. It wasn't stopping for anything, and it scooped up thief, Evee, and Squirtle in one fell swoop before continuing its madcap race bowling through the other side of the crowd.<p>A howl from the stone seller sent a chase through the market with the russet haired cart puller always one step ahead of the mob, until, believe it or not, they turned a corner and were gone.<p>-<p>"Huff, huhf, huh, huff..."<p>The wooden cart slowed, jarring the three passengers from the side where they were huddled onto the silk covered floorboards. They had just turned into an alleyway on the outskirts of the village, and ducked into an alcove that just barely shielded them from view from the road.<p>Three guesses as to who just rescued Mr. I-don't-need-anyone from the masses after his blood.<p>"Carlita?" came from a wide-eyed and disbelieving Giovanni as he absently recalled his Squirtle to the ball.<p>It took the busty red-head a few more mountain shaking breaths before she could reply.<p>"Why did you leeeeave me there, Giovaaaaanni?" she wailed, and he wished he hadn't opened his trap.<p>"Carlita, I thought you would rather stay with your, uh, pretties, than to come," (bother me) "on this heist."<p>Carlita blinked at this, processed it a bit and opened her mouth, thus reminding Giovanni that there was a god, and he was punishing him.<p>"That's true, Giovanni, but you took Evee with you. I wanted to play dress up with him, even got a cutesy little outfit all ready, but he wasn't there... Where is he?"<p>Looking around, reminded of something important, the slightly panicking youth dove into the silks and started rooting around muttering to himself like a crazy schizo bum.<p>"Where is it? It's got to be here somewhere, if I lose the stupid ... the boss will have my wages docked, and my rep! Shimatta, it would be in shambles! Aha! There you are!"<p>Giovanni exclaimed, grabbing a wriggling bundle underneath some cloth and tossing it aside to get at the bag of evolution stones he had stashed in a corner of the cart during their flight.<p>The bundle thocked against the side of the cart and tumbled to the hard stone ground, rolling to reveal a dazed and bruised Evee.<p>When he shakily got to his feet, his dark gaze turned to the humans happily cooing over their treasured prizes; Carlita refolding her silks, and Giovanni sorting his stolen stones. His gaze went from hurt to accusing before transforming into a glare at their carelessness. What did he do to deserve them for partners? It might be time to get a new team.<p>-<p>A different set of three pairs of eyes watched from the safety of the rooftops. After escaping from the crowd, Ranma's sense of honor reminded him that bringing the criminals to justice would be the right thing to do, even if the Amazons wanted to blame him first.<p>After all, how could they know he didn't do it when that 'little changer' made it seem like Ranma was the culprit?<p>It would also get him in good with the Elder Jigs Aw when she hears of it.<p>Decided, he asked his friends' opinions.<p>"Whatchu guys think? If we corner 'em as they are about to leave the village, we can finish them without revealing our abilities to everyone and their Aunt Yuki."<p>If he had understood their conversation, he would have called the whole thing off. Their priorities were very different indeed than Ranma's thoughts.<p>Dian and Pio exchanged glances.<p>'I'll do it if Ranma wants to, but that's putting him in danger. We don't know how many pokemon the thieves have in reserve. We might not be able to protect Ranma,' Dian murmured to the slit eyed Vulpix.<p>'I say go for it, despite your cowardish misgivings you 'fraidy-cat. They insulted Ranma's honor and we must avenge him.'<p>Dian hissed softly, whether in agreement or anger at the insults even he didn't know, but he turned to the waiting martial artist.<p>"We go. Rrememberr, Rranma. Pokemon fight firrst, then you."<p>Ranma's face hardened in the beginnings of protest, yet again.<p>"Rranma, forr honorr," caused the human's jaw to shut with a click of teeth as the cheek muscles flexed into relief.<p>"Fine, but Pio again takes the reserve up on the roofs." Turning to her cinnamon eyes, he continues, "You're our trump card if things go wrong. Nobody do anything stupid. This is a test of what we learned out there in our forest and how we work together against an unknown."<p>Dian and Pio nodded in understanding, but when Ranma turned away to observe the thieves again, they exchanged a look with each other that was the equivalent to crossing their fingers. Anything to protect their friend, right? It was in a pokemon's nature.
