</div>If you haven't lived it for yourself, you will never believe how much time and energy is spent getting through finals and the subsequent packing of your dorm room, and then driving across half of the country in order to arrive at home. It takes a lot out of a person.<p>I could apologize again and again for my lateness, but I don't want to get repetitive. I also bet that you just want to get on with the story...So here goes. I'll also try to move the story along a little faster. Tell me if I lose anybody.<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 8<p>Dian was beginning to get antsy.<p>It had been a week since the Electabuzzes had come to play and they were now showing signs of becoming a little too attached to HIS Ranma.<p>The Meowth had standards to keep and although he and his trainer were very capable fighters, he did not feel that the newcomers had proven themselves sufficiently in order to have the privilege of joining their group. Dian very much wanted to make this an elite team.<p>His burns had faded rapidly until he was entirely healed a mere two days after the 'incident'. The rest of the time the Electabuzzes were there, Dian spent it gaining the fighter's edge over his rivals for Ranma's attention. It was to their discredit that it took them four days to Dian's two in order to heal.<p>As the final day of the week rolled around, Dian decided to make his confrontation of the tethra and Pipsqueak while Ranma was out of the way and occupied with an herb hunt. The very responsible trainer had decided to stock up on medicinal supplies just in case another incident ever occurred.<p>Dian was perched up in a branch by the shelter they all shared and watched as the striped pokemon practiced in the meadow. Even he, in his minor jealousy, could appreciate the progress they had made under Ranma's tutelage.<p>Since Ranma had arrived, the wild human had focused his training aspects on various ki applications since Dian was already mostly trained in the physical aspects of the fight.<p>With the Electabuzzes, the apt trainer took a different approach. These pokemon were trained from birth that their electric abilities were all they had to defend themselves with. This meant that their physical sides were maintained, but not encouraged. Ranma's training brought out speed in an otherwise dumpy body, strength to those weak arms, and a general slimming down of that paunch that seems to ride so many waists of their species. Of course the Electabuzzes wanted to stay with Ranma.<p>Something that Dian could not allow. In the manner of all felines everywhere, Dian slipped away from his perch and began the stalk of his prey. He had no compunctions about what he was about to do. His intentions had been made clear that first day and notice had been given. There was nothing left to do but follow through on his promise.<p>Through the grasses of the meadow's outskirts he crept, intent upon his quarry. When he finally reached optimum pounce range, Dian did the wiggle butt dance that all cats seem to do in preparation of a successful leap. At the crucial moment, when the tethra's attention was fully centered on a blow from his underling, Dian pounced with jaws open to roar, but no sound emerging.<p>He had learned early on with Ranma that if he ever wanted to sneak up on his trainer, he had to be absolutely silent. Those first few times it took to learn this concept had Dian battered and bruised from a faulty landing with the aid of one of Ranma's fists or kicks.<p>The Electabuz tethra never knew what hit him. All he saw was an incoming electric Megapunch from the other of his kind when sudden pain and darkness were rained down on him from behind. He fell with a thud into unconsciousness.<p>The other Electabuz, whom Dian personally thought of as Pipsqueak or Junior, was startled into stillness for a second before his mind was able to process what just happened. Seeing that his leader was down for the count and that his new opponent was none other than their trainer's Meowth, Junior thought that it would be no big thing to be able to put down the attack. After all, wasn't it him that fried the little cat when they first met?<p>Let it also be known that although training progress for both of the species under Ranma's tutelage, aside from the joint practices or sparring under a watchful human eye, Dian kept his own training out of sight of his competitors. The element of surprise can be the only thing that turns the tide of battle in one's favor.<p>That, and a whole lot of skill, which Pipsqueak found out to his dismay. The Meowth was hiding a whole lot of potential from the Electabuz tethra and underling. Whenever Pipsqueak shot a Thundershock or Lightning Bolt, the feline always seemed to know in which direction to dodge.<p>Punches and kicks were evaded with almost insulting ease, and about the only thing that connected was when Junior blanketed the entire meadow with a thin sheet of lighting that covered everywhere at once. Unfortunately for him, it was a last ditch effort since he too lapsed into darkness after expending his final energies. Which was a too bad, since he was not able to see what his actions resulted in.<p>Dian was stung, but it did not incapacitate him as much as their previous encounter had. Even he could not see the subtle changes that were wrought on him. While the electricity of Junior's final shot still zapped around the meadow, Dian's eyes had taken on a small blue glint in their depths, rather similar to Ranma's when he was truly pissed off. The effects seemingly wore off as the lambent electricity dissipated.<p>This of course, left one irritated rather powerful Meowth in the company of a totally exhausted not too bright underling Electabuz. It is at the reader's discretion as to what happened next, but various sounds that run along the lines of "snap" "crackle" "pop" "swipe" and assorted meaty crunching noises were prevalent in the next few minutes.<p>Looking upon his handywork with no small amount of pride, Dian groomed himself of various bits of Electabuz fur before going about disposing of the unconscious bodies. Although he originally thought that it would be heavy work to drag an Electabuz across miles of forested terrain, Dian did not mind so much because it gave him the opportunity to run through some previously unexplored brambles and other thorny vegitation. Several times.  Slightly evil smirks abound on feline features.<p>In the end Ranma's training partner set the tethra and Pipsqueak within writhing distance of the traditional Electabuz territory. The tethra had just gained awareness when Dian came traipsing through the underbrush with Junior in tow.<p>Letting the carcass of tenderized meat flop to the ground, Dian fixed an eye on the tethra, but the other managed to beat him to speech.<p>I know why you are doing this, the Electabuz grumbled.<p>Dian tilted his head in query. ( I would say 'arched a brow', but that's silly. Meowths don't have brows to arch. ) He asked, And what are you going to do about it?<p>The tethra replies, Nothing, as although I can foresee the benefits of remaining the wild human's pokemon, I also do not wish to be forever fighting with you for dominance in his affections. I know I am the type to need to be first in everything, and I see that same trait in you. This would cause no end of trouble, as I cannot be fighting you off, learning from your trainer, and maintain my position in my own clan. I will choose the fight that I am sure I will win, and remain with my clan. Surely some of them will want to know why I've been gone this long, and the techniques and training I have undergone will be passed to others of my species.<p>Your human is truly an asset to the pokemon world, and you would do well to protect it from others who would harm him.<p>Dian looks wary but intrigued by this twist. He had thought that he would have to administer multiple beatings to the tethra in order to get his point across. Dian normally does not always resort to violence to communicate, but everyone knows that Electabuzzes can be inordinately stubborn. But his musings would have to wait, for the rather eloquent tethra was moving on with his obviously well thought out speech.<p>Just to let you know, I am amiable to a loose alliance with you and your human. None of my clan will bother you two unless a dire conflict arises, but you can feel free to call upon us in a time of need. You might also want to watch out for other challengers that might pop up now and again, as I can see some of the young ones trying to match themselves against the wild human in the future.<p>Dian nods and accepts this treaty. It truly will help them out in the future, if only to not have problems with the Electabuz clan. Throw in the promise of aide, and future sparring partners, and they've got themselves a deal!<p>Eyeballing the two one last time, Dian gave the tethra a final nod. They had an understanding. He made his way back through the forest in the base's direction. After all, the feline had dinner to catch while Ranma was out plant hunting. He remembered seeing a Pidgie nest on the way to the Electabuz lands. If he was quick, Pidgies made a far better meal with their plump bodies than the scrawny bad-tempered Spearows. Dian was of the thought that something from that species' personality seeped through into their flesh and tainted it with a bitter gamey taste.<p>Yes, he would drop by that nest and see if anyone was home. The Meowth's eyes gleamed with eyeshine in the shadows of the forest as he licked his chops. And Ranma had been shown to be adept at de-feathering the pesky bright plumage; why he would save those feathers, he didn't know, but he was sure the canny human had a use for them in the later days. Trust and faith go for a long way between training partners.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>Ranma took the absences of his recent training partners better than Dian expected. When Dian asked, Ranma just shrugged and said, "What? You think I would keep sentient people here with me when they obviously did not feel like staying?"<p>Dian looks dumbfounded.<p>"Man, I had enough of that with my old man, what with him shoving me and the tomboy together all the time."<p>Ranma's expression changes during the middle of his sentence, from slightly aggreived at what Dian thought of him, to sad, and a hardening deep within his eyes at the mention of his lost love. The human obviously still did not feel like opening up this avenue of conversation with his friend, but the little cat would leave him his  now.<p>If this kept on though, Dian would have to force the issue with his trainer. It just was not healthy to keep all of his feelings bottled up inside like he was doing. But for now, the emotion-worn mind needed most was something to take his attention away from the hurt, and that meant work. Work and training. Something that Dian could provide in abundance...For the next two months they worked like dogs, (pardon the pun) and steady advances were made in form, speed, and technique.<p>They two powerful inhabitants of the forest rarely saw more than one or two Electabuzzes or Nidoran, and nothing truly powerful intruded upon their sanctuary. Challenges eventually came and went from both the Electabuz community and the Nidorans. Each challenger came to the camp with the apparent notion that they could do what their elders could not, and win against a mere human, when they were obviously so much better.<p>Unofficially, the elders were appreciative of the human and Meowth for taking their youth down a peg, without capturing them into slavery. That august assembly for each species were also proud to notice that when their young did return, it was with a humbler attitude and with a sharper fighting prowess that could only be explained as a result of training with the human.<p>The forest Electabuz eventually became known for their lack of a paunch around their middle and the latent power in both their electricity and physical attacks. Now and then, one would see a hint of blue electricity emerging from the ones that trained with Ranma, but that was all. It was considered a sign of ...ahem, cough, cough..virility.<p>The Nidoran population became swifter in their attacks, charges, and poison horns. It became known to the other pokemon that it was much harder to harass or catch a Nidoran especially if it was seen leaving the human's meadow. It was not good to be a Nidoran predator.<p>The Nidoran's tethra was entirely happy with this situation and wanted to show his appreciation to the human called Ranma. Word of mouth stated that humans usually had fake fur coverings of good quality, and he had noticed that everything the wild human possessed was made from raw plants, or the tanned hides of the animals he had caught. This would not do, for the one who so markedly helped the Nidorans.<p>Because their population was so widespread, the tethra sent out a notice that he wanted a set of these coverings obtained. When they came through, he was told that they came from beyond the grasslands to the east and at the cost of almost getting one of his underlings caught by those rabid trainers that only lived for the thrill of the chase and capture.<p>The Nidoran beamed happily. Noone was hurt or caught, and he had a fine gift to deliver to the one human that had helped the species as a clan in his territory. Not that the tethra would deliver it himself, of course. That would be lowering his status to go to a human with an offering. No, one of his nieces or nephews would run this errand.<p>That Meowth of the humans would understand the gesture being made to them. He would understand, appreciate it, and perhaps be willing to aide them against future need. Ah, the subtleties of politics...how we pokemon lived for it.<p>I have recently received a review that spoke about beta readers, and it piqued my interest and vanity to know that there were grammar mistakes in my writing. This, in my own roundabout way, is me asking if there might be any out there willing to be my beta reviewer. Let me know if someone is interested, and don't forget to put in an email addy so I can send unfinished works to you to be polished. Again, this is only if you're interested.<p>Oh, and one more thing, I have not decided on a name for the Evee/ Umbreon that will come into play later. Help please?<p>For those of you out there that want humans in the story, bear with me, cause I will be putting them into play in the near future, but only after some bonding time when Pio and Akai enter the scene. Spoiler? I think not. I'm about to get ambitious with my characters after the next few chapters.<p>During the extent of the story, I will also explain about Ranma's affinity toward electricity, and why Dian is showing signs of sharing this trait. Everything will be explained in good time so keep your britches on.
