</div>A.N. Che, aren't you guys ever so lucky. I almost lost this chappie to the internet ether. But my very very brilliant beta reader Belgarah kept the copy I had sent for revision and was able to email it back to me for posting. Enjoy!<p>Assessing the Situation<p>Unnamed Master: Chapter 16<p>"What do you think I mean? 'Capture' as in hit the pokemon over the head a couple of times and quickly activate the pokeball to suck them in so they don't get away."<p>The blonde begins to look a little peeved at the bug-eyed look given to her. Even the Meowth is starting to look a little pesky. Geez, was it something she said? He didn't have to act so hypocritical. After all, wasn't HE a pokemon trainer? That was a good question. Too good to waste on an inner monologue.<p>"Hey, aren't you supposed to be a trainer as well? Where're your pokeballs and other training gear? How're you supposed to train your cutie Meowth correctly if you don't have the equipment to contain and teach him?<p>Looking incredulous, Ranma responded with a tried and true, "Are you bloomin' nuts girl?"<p>Dian added a hiss to voice his own displeasure. He was just happy with the way things were with his trainer, and he didn't want any of these Amazons putting idiotic ideas into Ranma's head.<p>"No, I am not 'bloomin' nuts' as you put it. I've very practical. That's the way everybody does it. How'd you get your Meowth if you didn't battle it and then capture it?"<p>"I, uh, well I DID fight with Dian a little. I don't remember much, but we did tussle around some."<p>"Ha! See. Don't get all snitty on me, cause you're just like the rest of us. Oh, is that his name? Dian?"<p>"Yeah, short for Guardian. But I didn't capture him in a little ball. Me an' Dian have an agreement. We're partners. He shows me the ropes and I train him."<p>"Che, to do what? Be a lout and a typical rude male?" And then focusing her attentions on Dian, she asked in a baby talk tone of voice. "Why don't you come and train with me? Leave the nasty smelly ol' male and we can be friends instead!"<p>Dian just pulled back his head and snorted delicately at her proposal. When Crescent turned her attention away, he muttered in Ranma's ear, "As if!"<p>Ranma hid a chuckle before looking back at his guide.<p>"So... I just have to sell some of my stuff here in this dinky booth, get gypped because I don't know the money system, and pay thirty of these arcmins every three months for rent. Did I leave anything out?"<p>"Well, just one thing you should know. Expect to haggle. A lot. We're Amazons here, and although I know many will appreciate the quality of your statues and other goods, a lot of the customers will try to downplay their value in order to get a better price. Typical older Amazons will also not like to make deals with young males like yourself. If I were you, I'd try to cater to the males of the village. They'll respect your work, and not give you too hard of a time."<p>Ranma sighed and scratched Dian's ear in an absentminded gesture.<p>"No time like the present, ne? Don't you have to be somewhere right now? I remember something about your mother's-"<p>Crescent's green eyes widened with surprise and horror.<p>"Oh my goddess! I forgot! Mom's gonna kill me!"<p>Ranma ended up waving bye to the dust cloud Crescent left behind. Then he turned around to survey the booth he had rented through his gold haired agent. It was a miserable shack of a construct.<p>Old weathered and rotting beams leaned against one another with an almost drunken air, the nails pegging them together were rusting and an old mildewed canvas stretched partway over the top of the frame but a corner was torn from its moorings and it was ragged in several places. The smell indicated that several animals or pokemon had once used its location for various undetermined pit stops.<p>"And this is what I get for most of the cash my statue brought? There's no way I can let myself stand near that, let alone sell stuff in it to other people."<p>Dian just batted some of Ranma's loose hair that was shifting in the breeze before speaking up.<p>"We fix, then, yes?"<p>"Most definitely, yes."<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~<p>One Rattata, Two Rattata, Three Rattata, Four, how many can you eat til you hit the floor!<p>Pio rolled over onto her back and wriggled in an attempt to scratch that one spot that always eludes her. Ranma knew just were to go scritchy scratchy to hit the spot. It was just way too boring here. It's been another half an hour since the two humans and the disgruntled Evee passed by into the village.<p>Ranma had been hovering over some spot in a market that she could barely see and many many humans were bustling about on their own business.<p>I wish something would happen soon.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>And something WAS going to happen soon. As soon as I hog tie and gag that stupid bimbo of a partner of mine!<p>"But Giova-aniii!" the voice from hell wailed. "I want some of the pretty clothes these women are wearing! It's of Amazonian cloth! Do you know what that means price wise in the League lands? Its very expensive stuff! If I showed up at the boss's city wearing a set of their marvelous silk tunics, the boss will just HAVE to notice me. Please Giovanni!"<p>"No Carlita! We are here for the stones, and only the stones. If we get greedy and attempt things that are beyond our control, we are setting ourselves up for failure. I will not allow failure to taint my reputation, so get a hold of yourself!"<p>The last was said with a finite gesture meant to close the subject. Carlita with her orangey hair, cinnamon eyes and *ahem* robust figure would tempt any man, but Giovanni had an iron will, and he would not be swayed by tears or pleas from a nuisance the home office had saddled him with in error. No. He would do his job, get the evolution stones, return to the home office and collect his reward. It would be another perfectly completed mission, and another mark of stature upon his flawless record. Soon, he would rise in rank, and eventually, although the aging boss did not know of his ambitions, Giovanni would take the boss's place at the top and bring the organization to future glory!<p>But that was far in the future. This was now, and now he had to snatch some quality moon and sunstones. It would be a tricky business. Not only because he had no faith in his partner, but also because the team's mascot pokemon was only an unevolved Evee, and the fact that the target of his planned heist were Amazons.<p>Amazons were not known for allowing thieves to get away with their booty. They were also violent, and inclined to look down upon outsider males unless proven otherwise, and Giovanni did not want to stick around long enough to prove himself to a people he was going to steal from.<p>At present, this fledgling team had placed themselves with a minimum of fuss on a building's roof right next to the poorer south west side of the market. From the looks of things, Giovanni would have to make his way to the pokemon section and nab the stones without provoking too much notice. Slight of hand was something every good aspiring member of the organization learned before signing up for a team and volunteering for missions.<p>Heh, that's something else I'm going to change when I'm boss. The organization will have to have a name. It's too vague when all of its members have to refer to their employment in such an oblique fashion.<p>~-~-~-~-~-~-~-<p>"Lets see, lets see. Most of the wood needs to be replaced, but I can do that real easy if I can get out to the woods. But then again, I don't know if these Amazons will let an outsider male use their village's forest like that. I could just buy the lumber, but that might take the rest of my money."<p>Dian was nodding in agreement at this point. He vocalized the next thing that had to go.<p>"Smelly rrags. Pheh!"<p>"Yup. That can get tossed into the garbage heap too. I have a beaded hide that I can pin to the top and let dangle. It should do for shade as well as advertisement."<p>Ranma looked around at the other shops nearby. To his left was a slightly seedy, yet comfortable booth that had rugs out on display. On his right showcased crudely made children's toys and tiny outfits for rugrats to run around in. Both owners were eyeing the loose haired martial artist with a speculative gleam.<p>The rugseller motioned him over, and when Ranma drew near enough for polite conversation, the portly old man spoke up with what is known as a whiskey voice; slightly scratchy yet somehow smooth with use.<p>"So, lad. Did the spicemaker Paynt finally lease out that old eyesore? Whatcha gonna sell there, boyo?"<p>With appraising eyes of his own, Ranma looked closer at the old man's set up. Deciding that the man was honest enough, he answered truthfully.<p>"Just some statues and beadwork I made myself. Nothing too important."<p>"Ah, trying to make your own way on your own merits. I can understand that." And then to the merchant on Ranma's other side, "Hey, Miter! We got ourselves a new entrepreneur! What say we make the lad welcome?"<p>The toymaker, now known as Miter, came away from his section and joined Ranma and the rugseller.<p>"Now boy, I'm not saying anything against you, but until that booth of yourn get some attention, I'm not putting too much faith in your entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, welcome. For what it's worth."<p>"Ancestors, man, what're you trying to do the lad? Scare him away from an honest living? Look, lad, my name is Awl. The horse-faced git over there is Miter. He makes toys for the youngins and his wife sews em little darlin' sets of clothes for them to run around in and ruin without breakin' their mother's banks, yanno?"<p>Ranma looked pleased to meet these pleasant men. Dian was paying more attention to the pokemon that had their heads poked out from the corners of the human's respective shops.<p>Miter the toymaker seemed to have a fellow Meowth, and Awl the rugseller's companion was a Spinnerak. It makes sense, Dian supposed. Fury swipes could quickly carve figurines from a chunk of wood if the Meowth was careful enough, and good spider silk was a precious commodity when using it to make durable floor coverings.<p>Dian was about to go make their acquaintance when Ranma snapped his fingers in remembrance, startling the other two merchants.<p>"Oi, Dian! Can I ask a favor?"<p>The feline looked up at his partner and shrugged a lean shoulder in a gesture that read loud and clear 'sure, whatever'.<p>"I need ya to locate a place where they sell brushes and other pokemon grooming stuff. I wanted to surprise Pio later, since you know how she is with keeping herself all prettified."<p>At his friend's derisive look, Ranma went on, despite the fascinated stares he garnered from his audience of two.<p>"I just need a location and a price. Oh, and also look for something that you want for yourself. I have no idea what to get you, but I wanted to treat you both to something nice."<p>Dian thought this over for a second before nodding and giving a particularly feline smile. The cat ran a rasping tongue over Ranma's hand when he reached down to scratch the Meowth behind the ears.<p>The playful cat ran off with Ranma's surprised yell in his ears. His partner wasn't expecting that, and he still wasn't fully over the Neko-ken in order to appreciate the finer points of feline affection.<p>~-~-~-~-~-<p>A.N. Not much of a chapter, but it still gets some informative points in. We now see some of the motives that drive Giovanni, and Ranma is just now trying to settle in for a day's work and trade.<p>Remember, Ranma is under no obligation to pay taxes, and the tax collectors will not be happy to hear this.<p>How do y'all like Miter and Awl? I don't know exactly where these two yokels came from, but they seem affable fellows.<p>Pio is bored out of her gourd, and the Evee despises his teammates about as much as Giovanni does.<p>Oh what am I going to do in the next chapter?
