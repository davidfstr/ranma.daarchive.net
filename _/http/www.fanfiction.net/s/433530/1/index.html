</div>                Novermber 12, 2000<p><p style="text-align:center;">November 13, 1999</p><p>My entire life changed the day that  Akane died.</p><p>God…</p><p>I can't talk about that right now</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 16, 1999</p><p>Akane was my fiancée when I was a  teenager.  Our parents had betrothed us,  so we didn't really get along, but I loved her.  You wouldn't know it by how I treated her, what with the constant  insults and jeers, but I did.  I loved  Akane more than life itself.</p><p>I still  can't believe how Akane died.  I mean,  geez, she'd survived demons, ghosts, crazed martial artists, curses, potions,  poisons, everything.  And after all  that, to die in a damned robbery…</p><p>She  wasn't even in Japan!  She died while  she was spending a semester of college in America!</p><p>God.  All those people who wanted to kill her  failed where a complete stranger looking for some quick cash succeeded.</p><p>I…I  have to stop.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 27, 1999</p><p>I just  got back from her grave.  It still hurts  so much when I think about her.</p><p>God, I  miss her.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 28, 1999</p><p>So  Akane was flown back to Japan and given a proper funeral.  She was cremated, and then she was  gone.  Forever.</p><p>I don't  blame Ryoga for reacting the way he did.   I mean, I missed Akane, too, and he had a mental affliction that made  him more disposed to violent reactions, but…man, he went too far.</p><p>He shot  a giant Shi Shi Hokodan, and I just couldn't get everyone out of the way in  time.  Kasumi died instantly, thank  goodness, but my mom wasn't so lucky.</p><p>She  suffered for three years in the hospital before she died.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 30, 1999</p><p>Today I  saw Ukyo again.  It was great seeing her  after so long.  We talked for an hour,  at least.  I can't remember the last  time I had so much fun. I laughed more in that time than I have since It  happened.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 1, 1999</p><p>I'm  gonna kill my pop.  I can't believe  this!  GOD DAMNIT, POP!</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 1, 1999 –  Evening</p><p>I had  to get out of the house.  The stench of  my father's panda form is too much to bear.</p><p>As soon  as I woke up this morning, Pop and Mister Tendo told Nabiki and I that we were  now engaged, because more than enough time had passed to consider the period of  mourning over.  Yeah, right.  Couldn't they see Nabiki's red eyes?  Didn't they hear her cry herself to sleep  every night?</p><p>Nabiki took  Akane and Kasumi's deaths really badly.   She won't cry in public, but I hear her in her room late at night, and I  see her red, puffy eyes.  I know how she  feels.  I feel sorry for her.</p><p>God, I  need to talk to Nabiki about this.  We  need to figure something out.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 2, 1999</p><p>Nabiki  and I talked today, and we decided that we weren't getting married.  There's no way either of us are getting  married is more like it.  Too many bad  memories, too much past.</p><p>We  figured we'd tell 'em tonight, at the "engagement dinner" they're throwing  us.</p><p>Damn  old man.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 3, 1999</p><p>Last  night went as well as I could have hoped.   Nabiki and I told them about our decision to break the engagement, and  we both got thrown out of the house.   Mr. Tendo told us not to come back until we were married.</p><p>He's  changed.  It's almost as if, after Akane  and Kasumi died, he went a little mad.</p><p>Well,  no matter what the reason, Nabiki and I were tossed out.  Nabiki is really out of it.  She's in a state of shock.  Heh.   I can understand that.</p><p>I led  the shaking Nabiki around town for a while, looking for a place to stay, when  we ran into Ukyo.  I quick told her what  had happened, and she instantly insisted that we stay with her until we figured  something out.  I tried to decline, but  she was adamant about the fact that we should come to her place, so I  eventually accepted.  It DID beat  spending a night under a bridge, that's for sure.</p><p>Nabiki  took Ukyo's bed, because she was…messed up.   Ukyo and I sat on the couch and talked for hours on end.  At first she wanted to know what had  happened to get us thrown out of the house.   She eventually asked me about whether or not I wanted to marry Nabiki.  I really don't know what happened with me  when she asked that, but I started crying like a baby.  Sobbing, really.</p><p>I used  to be all macho about that kind of thing, but since Akane died, I've cried more  than I care to remember.  It's  frightening, really, how much I've changed since Akane was alive and well.</p><p>Anyway,  I cried for what seemed like three hours, and Ukyo eventually said that I  should get to sleep.  I remember weakly  nodding, but she tried to get me to take the couch.  I don't care how messed up I am, I'm not gonna let a woman sleep  on the floor while I'm on a couch.  No  way.</p><p>Long story  short, she slept on the couch.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 4, 1999</p><p>Yesterday  I took Nabiki to the doctor.  I was  really worried about her.  I still am,  truthfully.</p><p>Anyway,  the doctor said that she was physically okay.   That means that she's like she is because of some mental trauma.  Not good.</p><p>It  really won't help her to find out that her dad killed himself.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 6, 1999</p><p>Nabiki  was getting better.  She actually spoke  to me yesterday, when I went to see her in the psychiatric ward of the  hospital.  Of course, I had to go and  tell her that her dad had killed himself.</p><p>The  doctors say that she's regressed into herself so far that they're not sure if  she'll ever come out of it.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 10, 1999</p><p>I  talked with Pop yesterday.  He said that  he was going on another training voyage.   He even asked me if I would have liked to come along.  I said no.   I didn't want to have to deal with him anymore.</p><p>I don't  think I'll see him ever again.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 12, 1999</p><p>I'm  gonna move out of Ukyo's place today.   I'm gonna go and tell her right now.</p><p>Okay.  Just had to write that down.  It's pretty important.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 13, 1999</p><p>She  convinced me to stay until the end of the month.</p><p>I  remember when I would have stopped at nothing to get what I decided I was gonna  get.</p><p>What  happened to me?</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 20, 1999</p><p>Ukyo  and I had sex last night.  I started  crying, and she comforted me, and I kissed her, and we…had sex.</p><p>I'm  sorry, Akane.  I'm so sorry.</p><p style="text-align:center;">October 31, 1999</p><p>I've  been in China ever since I left Ukyo's place.  I still can't believe I had sex with her.  I hope the note I left doesn't make her hate  me.</p><p>I know  I hate myself already, and I don't want her hating me too.</p><p>So I'm  in China right now.  I'm moving towards  Jusenkyo.  I'm gonna get rid of the  curse that's been plaguing me for so long.   I would have done that for Akane, so I'm gonna do it.  If I would've done it for Akane, it's okay  to do it.  It's worth doing, then.</p><p>I love  you, Akane.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 2, 1999</p><p>I'm  cured now.  I only wish Akane were here  to see it.<br/>I did this for you,  Akane.  I did this for you.</p><p>I'm on  my way to visit Ryoga in jail.  I kinda  want to see him.  I still don't know how  they manage to keep Ryoga in jail, especially with his little habit of  shattering rock, but I'm not complaining.  If he's in there, he can't hurt anyone else, right?</p><p>I've  had a headache for a couple of days, now.   I hope I feel better.</p><p>Akane,  I love you so much.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 10, 1999</p><p>I  should get to Ryoga's jail by tomorrow, noon at the latest.  I'm looking forward to it, actually.  I always considered Ryoga a friend.</p><p>Didn't  I?</p><p>My  memory has been getting fuzzy over the past couple of days.  My headache has been getting worse,  too.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 12, 1999</p><p>Ryoga  was an asshole.  He tried to kill me the  second he saw me.  He was drugged – I  found out that was how they were keeping him cooped up – but even so, he tried  to kill me when I showed up.  So I  killed him.  I really didn't know what I  was doing.  Honestly, I didn't.  He came at me, and after a couple of dodges,  my headache became blindingly painful, and the next thing I remember was  staring at my blood-covered hand while jail guards called for a doctor and kept  their guns trained on me.  They were  gonna capture me for killing him, or something.  Like it was my fault in the first place!</p><p>Anyway,  I got out of there, and I'm running from the law now.  No big deal.  I have  Akane, so I'm happy.</p><p>NO!  Akane's dead!</p><p>I love  you, Akane.</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 20, 1999</p><p>My  headache is constant.  I can't  sleep.  I have no appetite.  My eyes are dry and itchy.  I feel horrible.  But I have to keep going.   If I don't, I won't be able to find Akane.</p><p>I keep  on trying to remember something.  It's  like there's something in the back of my mind that I should remember, but don't.  Something about Akane's funeral?  But that's impossible.  I've been chasing Akane for a long time,  now.  Haven't I?</p><p style="text-align:center;">November 30, 1999</p><p>Damn  villagers.  I had to kill the whole lot  of them to get through the small mountain pass their village was in.  I lost a lot of ground on Akane.  I'll have to run, now.</p><p>I'm  coming, Akane.  Please wait.</p><p style="text-align:center;">December 2, 1999</p><p>I'm  gonna catch her.  I swear it.</p><p style="text-align:center;">December 1999</p><p>My  headache is so bad that I pass out.  No  matter.  I've got to find Akane.

The  patrol was one of twenty searching for the deranged martial artist.  Japanese and Chinese authorities dispatched  the patrols when the reports of Saotome's first victims – the guards and  inmates of Japan's ultra-maximum security prison – came in.</p><p>Among  his possessions was found a diary, in which he wrote during his last days.  Governmental officials are now searching for  his father.</p><p>Japanese  and Chinese authorities are happy to have this episode behind them.  "I am very glad," said Premier Jiang Zemin  of China, "that Saotome was stopped before he could cause any more problems for  my country."</p><p>Saotome's  body will be cremated and interred next to the ashes of his fiancée, whose  death helped drive him insane.</p></p>
