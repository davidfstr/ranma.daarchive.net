</div><br/>TitleMartial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition/Title<p>Duels and Curses<p>~This should be harder,~ Ranma thought briefly.<p>She leaped over Ryouga's rope and dropped a club to tangle it as she did. An attempt to pull away the tool resulted in Ryouga jerking back. If it were a real fight Ranma would let Ryouga pull him in for a kick, but he couldn't attack without the tools according to the rules.<br/>Ranma let herself be pulled along anyway, gliding just over the ground. Ryouga smirked, letting the rope go in favor of another club, kicking it up. Ranma took the opportunity to pull Ryouga's rope up and dropped his legs to the ground, with a burst of strength sending herself just over the celestial's head. Ryouga felt the breeze as she passed an inch above, too quickly for him to take advantage of the pass.<br/>"What the-~?" Ryouga gasped, looking up as Ranma executed the aerial technique. ~So accurate without wings? How?~ He didn't have time to figure it out, the rope circled around his arm and he was flying, bouncing off the wooden floor just short of the wall.<br/>~I dominated that exchange,~ Ranma took in a deep breath. ~Completely.~<br/>~Fighting in a style I've mastered and he first saw a week ago.~ Ryouga kippuped to his feet and stared at Ranma a little more cautiously. Ranma was staring after him with something similar to shock.<br/>~I can...~ Ranma took a step back from Ryouga.<br/>~...beat me.~ Ryouga frowned and stepped forward.<br/>Akane watched as the practice ground to a halt and watched the shifting stances. It was turning serious, and not the same sort of enraged battle Ranma and Ryouga normally entered into whenever they were around each other. They were measuring each other.<br/>~Have to be ready to break them up,~ Akane thought, standing up and running through a list of what she could call up with one hand.<br/>Then Ryouga moved.<br/>He was fast, stabbing forward with his clubs. She expected Ranma to rush head on as well, and take on Ryouga directly as she usually did. When the redhead merely started dodging away from the attack Akane crinkled her eyes in confusion.<br/>Ryouga frowned and started interspersing his stabs with wide sweeps. Ranma let them past her, an uncertain look on her face, finally rolling under and past Ryouga. Akane watched Ranma stand up and look at Ryouga's back, the redhead had a clear opening as the other fighter was still turning around. She was leaping away before Ryouga completed his turn. It was the blink of an eye, not inhumanly fast, but damn close.<br/>"Are you done playing with me?" Ryouga demanded. He tossed his clubs at the red head, and Ranma spun out of their path and continued staring at Ryouga. "After this match we'll fight for real."<br/>Ranma shook her head and vanished from sight.<br/>"He teleported," Akane said. ~No spell, either. Some technique?~ "What happened there?"<br/>"Coward's playing games with me," Ryouga said. "Just because he got lucky in that practice."<br/>"What is it with you two anyway?" Akane asked. "Isn't it a little silly to be fighting this much over a girl that's probably gone on to her own life?"<br/>"Feh. I don't know what you're talking about." Ryouga crossed his arms. "But if you knew about Ranma you'd be right along with me." Ryouga started walking out of the dojo.<br/>"Where are you going?" Akane wondered.<br/>"I have to be at the match," Ryouga said. "I'll need to find it you know."<br/>"I don't care what's between you and Ranma," Akane said firmly. "The pride of my temple is behind this. If you want to protect me, stay out of Ranma's way."<p>********<p>Akane looked into the guest room and noted angrily that Ranma wasn't there. He should have been sleeping, getting ready for the match. After thinking about everything yesterday she softened her expression and sighed.<br/>She walked down the stairs and considered what was going to happen today. She felt confident, assuming Ranma didn't mess up somehow. Or the unknown party behind last night's attack got involved. She glanced in toward the living room and saw Ranma-chan lying on her chest.<br/>"She was sleeping on the roof," Kasumi said, passing by Akane. "I decided to take the chance to treat her wounds."<br/>"Were they bad?" Akane asked. Kasumi shook her head and Akane sighed in relief.<br/>"They should not affect her fighting at all," Kasumi said. "They'll scar though, badly considering the light wounds. Probably yours as well."<br/>"I can handle a few scars," Akane said. She flexed her hand. "And there's no real damage. I don't understand how he can be so vain."<br/>"Perhaps he'll tell you sometime," Kasumi said. "Why was she on the roof?"<br/>"He seemed upset about something," Akane said.<br/>"Well," Kasumi said. "Maybe it was the cat."<br/>"I guess," Akane said. Ranma groaned and rolled to sitting up. "You're awake."<br/>"When did I get here?" Ranma asked wearily.<br/>"I carried you," Kasumi said. Then she smiled. "You should be more careful about where you fall asleep. You could catch cold." Ranma arched an eyebrow and snorted at that possibility. "Breakfast will be ready soon. Then I assume it is off to the match."<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said. "Where's the pig?"<br/>~Right letter, wrong animal,~ Akane thought. "Ryouga? He left for the match after you...vanished."<br/>"Should be a while before we see him I guess," Ranma said. "He's off getting 'lost' like usual, jerk."<br/>"He really does get lost you know," Akane said. Ranma snorted.<p>Ryouga looked up at Hebereke temple in awe.<br/>"I actually got here," he said. "It...must be fate. Now all I have to do is find the gymnasium and I can make sure Ranma..." He frowned, Akane had expressly forbidden him to interfere in this. And there was something else as well.<br/>Ryouga thought over his last few fights with Ranma. He had known that Ranma had improved the first time they had collided over Furinkan Hall. He just hadn't realized how much Ranma had improved until last night.<br/>"I'll have to train myself then," Ryouga said. "Now where is this stupid..." There was a splash of water from above.<p>********<p>Ranma looked at the bird in her hand, and the chain that connected it to her wrist. There was to be no spells in the match, but there had already been plenty of magic and other tricks. Now this.<br/>"Hey, Mr P," Ranma said wearily as the bird pecked at his hand. "When did you get back."<br/>"You are too careless," Kodachi laughed. "But then all of Ryoko's followers tend to rush headlong into things."<br/>"These are the rules for this duel," the refree declared. "No unarmed attacks, no spells, no time limit. The match ends with a surrender, one opponent falls from the ring, or one opponent is unable to continue the fight."<p>********<p>"Is it a good idea to be here?" Tenchi asked from the seat clearly marked as "prize."<br/>"Oh what's the worse that could happen?" Ayeka asked. "Perhaps this drunk here will cause a scene, but not me."<br/>"What drunk?" Ryoko asked, blearily. Ayeka rolled her eyes.<br/>"Were you drunk before or after you accepted Little Ranma as your priestesses substitute?" Ayeka demanded. "Succubi are not known for their skill in battle."<br/>"Neither are dryadsh," Ryoko said, smirking. "And you should know Ranma better than that."<br/>"Ranma's good," Tenchi agreed. "But this isn't his style."<p>********<p>"What's that idiot doing up there?" Akane wondered. "I thought I told him not to get in the way."<br/>"It doesn't look like he has much choice, Akane," Nabiki said.<p>********<p>"Listen, lady," Ranma said, holding the bird still. "I'm gonna see you out of the ring in a moment so I can get this over with. I don't like beating on people." Ranma transfered the irritable bird to one hand and lashed out with a ribbon to attempt and snatch Kodachi.<br/>"You are a sentimental sort," Kodachi sneered. "I remember that from before." She swung out with her rope, easily deflecting the twirling ribbon.<br/>~Huh?~ Ranma blinked. ~Her technique is better than Ryouga's?~ The bird started to struggle in her hand. "Hey calm down! You want get your wings broken?" Ranma barely avoided the down swing of Kodachi's 'rope' and saw it contact the ground, and dent it.<br/>"You should be concerned with yourself," Kodachi smiled. "Not the bird."<br/>"What are you trying to do," Ranma yelled. "Kill me?"<br/>"Of course not," Kodachi huffed. "I would never kill one of Ryoko's followers. Humiliate, cripple, embarrass, but never kill." Ranma gave her a deadpan look.<br/>"Great," she said.<br/>Kodachi dropped her 'rope' and grabbed a pair of clubs tossed by her second. She stabbed forward with her clubs, face calm as Ranma dodged. Thorns suddenly grew out of the club and scraped along Ranma's cheek. Ranma growled.<br/>"No spells!" Akane shouted. "The rules say no spells!"<br/>"No spells in the ring," the officiator corrected. "She cast that before the match started."<br/>"You...you..." Ranma let go of the bird, which moved to her head and started pecking. The redheads hands clenched tightly.<p>********<p>"She just cut Ranma!" Ryoko growled angrily, standing up.<br/>"No interference, Ryoko," Ayeka snapped. "It is mortal magic, she should not be concerned. Not like what ever fool marked her other cheek." Ryoko relucantly sat down.<br/>"A celestial," Ryoko said. "She doesn't want it healed."<br/>"What?" Tenchi asked. Ryoko smirked.<br/>"Akane said it looked cute," she explained.<br/>"I don't understand your neice," Ayeka said shaking her head. "Why does she care what that brute of yours think."<br/>"Better a brute than a psycho," Ryoko retorted.<br/>"Then why choose someone who is both?" Ayeka wondered. Ryoko frowned.<p>********<p>"You cut me!" Ranma shouted.<br/>"Why should you care," Kodachi wondered. "With a face already marred like yours." She smiled evily. "Of course, on my Lord Ranma such marks seeming dashing."<br/>"I am not your Lord Ranma!" Ranma shouted angrily.<br/>The redhead swung around kicked one of the poles marking the borders. Spun around again and launched the neatly severed piece of wood into Kodachi's face. The pigeon cooed angrily as it was jerked around by the motion. Ranma landed lightly glaring at the gymnast and then looking at the angry pigeon apologetically.<br/>"Sorry 'bout that," she shrugged. The bird, as usual, responded by ineffectually pecking at her head. "Hey it's not my fault she chained you to me."<br/>"Insolent girl," Kodachi snapped. "Of course you are not Lord Ranma! You are the wrong gender for one thing."<p>********<p>"She's seen Ranma in both genders, right?" Tenchi asked.<br/>"No comment," Ayeka muttered. Ryoko snickered.<br/>"Oh what heavenly beauty is before me?" a voice said from behind the deities.<br/>"Pardon?" Ayeka asked, turning around.<p>********<p>"Well, he's not yours anyway!" Ranma snapped. Kodachi frowned and moved forward to look at Ranma cautiously.<br/>"I see," Kodachi said grimmly. "That is why you have marred your face in imitation of him! You want my Lord Ranma as well!" Kodachi shrieked and struck downward with her club, and Ranma countered the club, suddenly thorny again, with a length of chian.<br/>"Sorry," Ranma said to the pigeon that she had jerked away. Then she glared at Kodachi again. "All right! That does it!" Ranma vanished as Kodachi struck downward with her club, pushing the suddenly empty chain down to the ground.<br/>"There are to be no spells!" Kodachi protested loudly. She twisted around to face behind, where she expected the other girl to reappear. She caught the barest glimpse of a silohette before something landed lightly behind her, and a rope circled around her wrist.<br/>"This is over!" Ranma shouted. The redhead noted Kodachi pulling a piece of metal to her mouth and frowned, opening up her mind to see what the Jurain was thinking. Her eyes opened wide as she glanced down at the raised arena beneath her. Ranma rolled to grab a ribbon and leaped into the air as Kodachi blew her whistle.<br/>The arena moved to the sound of the whistle holding almost exactly underneath the leaping Ranma. Kodachi gasped in surprise as the ribbon wrapped around her and she was jerked away, across to the other side of the fighting ground. The redhead watched the silvery tint of the noble's whistle strike the ground as Kodachi landed roughly on the ground.<br/>Ranma glared at the platform beneath her and moved to check on the bird. It was angry, somewhat dizzy, and of course it started to peck at her as soon as she picked it up.<br/>"Hold still, Mr. P," Ranma said before whispering quietly in the harsh abyssal language and destroying the chain. "Sorry about all that, should have thought of that a while ago."<br/>The bird kept pecking at her, following her as she jumped off of the arena. Ranma turned angrily toward the arena and in a fit of pique smashed her fist into the wood. The arena exploded upward scattering startled servants everywhere. Ranma frowned and looked up at the sky.<br/>~I don't need any help, Lina,~ she thought angrily.<br/>"The match is forfeit," Kodachi shouted as she stood up. "She used spells!"<br/>"That wasn't a spell," Akane said, watching Ranma. The redhead was sweating as she walked over to them. ~And it looks like it takes a lot of him.~<br/>"Then how pray tell did the harlot..." Kodachi was interrupted by a shriek.<br/>All attention turned to the "prize" seat. Most people apparently were seeing the trio that sat in that vincinity for the first time. Ayeka stood behind Tenchi looking deeply offended and infuriated. Tenchi had a grim expression as he recognized the source of the affront. Of course Ryoko was the most obvious.<br/>"Oh brother-dear," Kodachi whispered in shock. "What have you done?" Ranma vanished and appeared next to the angry gods as the others moved in more traditional manners.<br/>"You touch her again and I'll rip every fucking organ out of your body one at a time," Ryoko shouted lifting Kuno off the ground. "And I CAN keep you alive while I do it."<br/>"Hey, Auntie Ayeka," Ranma gasped as she reappeared next to Ayeka, glancing nervously toward the mortals to make sure they hadn't heard her. "You okay?" ~Three teleports in twenty four hours, with everything else.~ She was obviously sweating and breathing heavily now. Ayeka nodded at her and frowned angrily at the mortal Ryoko held.<br/>"I was merely showing my appreciation for the..." Kuno started to protest. Ryoko snarled and tossed the idiot away.<br/>"Stupid mortal," Ryoko spat.<br/>"You claim to be my follower," Tenchi said coolly. "And you do that?"<br/>"I have been a true follower," Kuno protested, then frowned. "Ah I see it now, you are merely imitations of Lord Tenchi and his wives." Kuno frowned and shifted into stance. "I, the blue thunder of-!" A lightning bolt crackled out of the sky and struck Kuno into the ground.<br/>"No sword shall ever remain in your hands for long," Tenchi declared. "Whether destroyed, stolen or lost, you shall not keep them."<br/>"And no anger directed at you shall be light," Ryoko added, moving behind Tenchi and standing next to Ayeka. "Those you anger shall be enraged beyond reason."<br/>"And any who knowingly help you shall see all the plants of their lands die around them," Ayeka added angrily. "You should know better than to affront anyone so, much less someone with power."<br/>"He tried to grope you?" Akane gasped as she came up to the small crowd.<br/>"I would never," Kuno tried to protest.<br/>"Of course you would," Ranma snapped. "You do it to me all the time." The three dieties flashed a look at Ranma and then angrily glared at Kuno again. "But I didn't think even you would be this stupid."<br/>"Brother," Kodachi said sadly. "You are an idiot."<br/>"Sister, surely you must see..." Kuno tried to explain, stopping when Kodachi turned away from him.<br/>"These curses shall be on your head until you admit and atone for your actions," Tenchi declared. "I have been lenient with your posing until now. Now leave!"<br/>"I shall leave," Kuno said, weakly climbing to his feet. "And you shall see that a true paladin of Tenchi shall persevere." He started to limp away before the silent crowd.<p>********<p>"Cursed by your god," a voice said out of the shadows. Kuno turned from his poorly made camp site to look. "What a terrible fate."<br/>"Who are you," Kuno demanded. "And what business of it is yours what transpires between me and those imposters?"<br/>"I am someone that can give you a way around those curses," the figure stepped forward and Kuno caught a hint of bandages. "I merely ask for a favor."<br/>"And what favor is that?" Kuno asked cautiously.<br/>"There is a girl, somewhere in the region," the male voice said. "I wish for you to find and destroy the devil holding her, and bring me the girl."<br/>"And what is so special about this girl?" Kuno asked standing up and facing the apparition.<br/>"Just bring me the girl and you're curses will be lifted," the voice said.<br/>"I think not," Kuno said firmly. "I would not taint myself with your service for my benefit."<br/>"Then enjoy your life," the voice said laughing. "As brief as it will be."<p>********<p>"I'm seeking Mistress Azami," the young woman said. She frowned at the startled and sad silence that she received.<br/>"Mistress Azami?" the innkeeper said. "The wu jen?"<br/>"Yes, she has the daughter of someone important in her care," the woman said. The innkeeper noted the blade at the woman's side and the pointy ears, almost elven.<br/>"You mean little Linn?" the man asked.<br/>"Yes, where is she?" the woman asked, she gripped her sheath with her left hand.<br/>"You're asking about that witch?" a loud thug demanded from behind her. "She's dead, and that little brat of hers is gone. And good riddance."<br/>"Azami was not my favorite person," the woman said. "But would you mind explaining what happened before I beat you to within an inch of your life?"<br/>"Guess your employer got tired of you looking for his daughter," the thug said. Three other large men joined him. "Some blonde with a fetish for cute animals came by and hired us to the help her rescue the girl."<br/>"Where did they go?" the woman asked angrily, frowning. She leaned forward.<br/>"Nah, I don't think we'll tell you," the man said. "Unless you give us a little fun first."<br/>"Sure thing, Jackass," the woman said cheerfully. Then she moved, drawing her blade and swiftly moving between the thugs. In her wake she left the four thugs sprawled out senseless, bones broken. Then she sheathed her blade and looked about the unconscious thugs. "Do you know where this 'blonde' went, or do I have to wait for them to wake up."<br/>"Th...th..they're not dead?" the innkeeper stuttered. The woman drew her blade and indicated the blunt outer edge.<br/>"Not with this," she said. The innkeeper relaxed. "But I can still do a lot of damage. Where did they go?"<br/>"Nerima!" the man snapped desperately. The woman dropped him in shock.<br/>"That's where he's supposed to be," she whispered. She looked up at the sky and breathed. "I've given up on vengeance and now I have to go straight to where that Jackass lives." She shook her head and walked out of the inn. "I wonder if I would be forgiven for beating him up a little."<br/>"Who are you anyway?" the innkeeper asked.<br/>"Ukyou," the woman said. "Ukyou of Kamiya Temple."<p>Back to Martial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition
