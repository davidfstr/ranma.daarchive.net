</div><br/>TitleMartial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition/Title<p>To the Fierce Demoness<p>"Nabiki Tendo I...have need of your services," Kuno said reluctantly.<br/>"Oh really Little-Kuno?" Nabiki asked without looking up from the tome of beauty secrets she had taken borrowed from the Hall's library. "What do you need this time?"<br/>The last time Kuno had hired her it was to identify the "demonic beast" that had been "ravaging the Kuno stores." It had taken Nabiki all of two minutes and no magic to find the raccoon tracks. Moderately insulting, but at least it was an easy job.<br/>"Yesterday I found myself presented with a fierce demoness," Kuno started. The Xellos priestess immediately started choking. "Is something wrong, Lady Tendo?" Nabiki took a big breath to clear her throat and assembled herself to answer the swordsman.<br/>"I just breathed in some dust is all," Nabiki assured him. "Which demoness was this Little-Kuno?"<br/>"She had crimson hair, like blood pooling in the darkness," Kuno explained. "Worn short in a pigtail, with an elegant sleeveless tunic that left her dark wings free to move."<br/>"Oh that demoness," Nabiki said. ~I'd have thought he'd forget that part.~ "I know her."<br/>"Nabiki Tendo," Kuno declared. "Can this be true! Do you also make a practice of summoning fiends for your purposes?"<br/>"Let's not leap too far here Little-Kuno," Nabiki insisted. "I've seen her once or twice, I know where she...lairs why?" Kuno sat down, unrolled a scroll, and hastily began writing.<br/>~If she thinks that she can defeat the great Sir Kuno and simply walk away,~ Kuno thought while chuckling evilly. ~Then she thinks wrongly.~ He stood up sharply and presented the newly written message. "Here..."<br/>Nabiki looked at the message and considered it briefly before taking the envelope, and a few coins besides.<p>*******<p>"This is for me?" Ranma blinked as he held the message.<br/>"To the 'fierce demoness' he said," Nabiki clarified. "You've really got is imagination working. I don't even think he knows you're the same person."<br/>"'Meet me in the second field of Furinkan Hall,'" Ranma read aloud.<br/>"Sounds like a duel, huh?" Akane said calmly from behind Ranma.<br/>"Little-Kuno just hates to lose!" Nabiki added. She had suspected something like this, it was a good chance. She still didn't want to risk casting a spell directly over Ranma to detect anything, it might tip him off, but she could always examine behavior.<br/>"Vengeful, hmm?" Akane said, trying not to sound a little concerned. If Ranma wanted to rush his way straight into trouble it was no problem of hers. Ranma crushed the letter and tossed it back with a determined look on his face.<p>*******<p>Nabiki stretched as she stood up and started to walk for the monastery exit.<br/>"Oh, Nabiki," Kasumi's voice called out.<br/>"Yeah?" the middle Tendo turned to face her sister.<br/>"I need you to do a small favor for me," the priestess of Belldandy told her.<br/>~Well its a couple of hours yet until Ranma's duel,~ Nabiki considered. "Sure, what is it?"<br/>"I need you to check the wards about the grounds."<br/>"B..but that'll take all day!" Nabiki protested. "If I start right away!"<br/>"I know," Kasumi said regrettfully. "But it needs to be done, and I have my own duties to attend to."<br/>"What about Akane?" Nabiki suggested. Kasumi looked at her. "Right, forget I suggested it. I'll get started."<br/>"Thank you, Nabiki," Kasumi said cheerfully before walking out, on her way to her goddess's temple.<br/>"What wonderful timing," Nabiki muttered. She considered just leaving to see Kuno's duel with Ranma anyway, but that would leave her caught in a direct lie, probably the worst thing she could do. ~I wonder if Kasumi even knows how neat a little trap this is.~<p>*******<p>Ranma-chan stood in the middle of the training field dressed loosely in her fighting clothes. A cold wind blew through the field and ruffled her hair as she waited. Ranma absently reached up to push the strands away from her face and straighten her hair out<br/>a little.<br/>"So you have come," Kuno said as he strode forward to meet her. "My fierce demoness."<br/>"You don't learn very quickly," Ranma noted irritably while looking over the swordsman. "Do you pal? Well, where's your sword?"<br/>"Heh," Kuno snorted arrogantly, looking down towards the ground and inclining his face away from her. "I have no need of a sword."<br/>"Yeah?" Ranma asked dryly. "Pretty confident, I guess."<br/>"Confident enough," Kuno said. "To give...you...THIS!" Kuno shouted as he tossed<br/>something at the red-haired girl. Ranma, a confused look on her face reached up and snatched the object before looking at it and seeing a bouquet of roses.<br/>"I love you," Kuno said simply, turning away from Ranma and walking.<br/>"HAH!" Ranma said aloud, stopping the swordsman in his tracks. "Sorry, but that's just gotta be the funniest thing I've heard in a long time."<br/>"Tis true, nonetheless," Kuno protested.<br/>"Give it up pal," Ranma smirked, he channeled a small stream of power into the roses. The vibrant colors of the plants faded and withered in moments as the cold energy surrounded Ranma's hand. "A pervert like you ain't got a chance with me that way." She resisted the urge to shift out of human form, here, where anyone could see her.<br/>Ranma tossed the browned flowers at the swordsman, the roses distintegrated before reaching him. Then Ranma left, leaping away before Kuno could react.<br/>"Such is the nature of the spell binding her to this place," Kuno sighed as the wind continued to blow.<p>*******<p>Master Tofu walked away from the home of his last patient and rubbed his chin. The condition of the young man wasn't serious, and he had quite honestly told a concerned parent that he would be fine with a few days rest. It was the apparent cause of the<br/>patient's weakened stupor that bothered him.<br/>His life force had been drained, and that meant problems. The draining had been fairly gentle, and only a small amount had been taken. In fact it seemed as if whoever had done was trying to avoid seriously<br/>hurting the victim. That might change, however, if whoever or whatever was doing it felt safe.<br/>Tofu remembered a small redhead that had been walking with the two younger Tendos. He had been meaning to talk to her about dangerous studies already. Now he wondered if the power she was drawing was more a matter of nature than education.<p>*******<p>Ranma-succubus stretched her bare body up and outward, the great wings on her back mirroring the movement of her arms. Then she sighed and looked down at the lifeless husk that had been her lover. He should never have pushed her.<br/>"Told you," Ranma said, only half-regrettfully. "Nothing but a snack."<br/>"I love you," the corpse whispered.<br/>"Nah, you're just a pervert," Ranma said carelessly.<br/>"What have you done!" Ranma turned to see her mother. "You have drained the fool to death!"<br/>"But you said I should..."<br/>"RANMA!" Ranma whirled to see Akane standing in the doorway, holy symbol presented. "A demon in my home!"<br/>"Oh my!" Kasumi's face and voice took on a hard tone. "We have to do something about this!"<br/>"Of course we do," Nabiki agreed. The three presented their holy symbols. Ranma nearly laughed as he heard them chanting to banish evil.<br/>"But I'm not..." Ranma stopped short and screamed as he felt herself ripped to pieces and put back together again. Before she could catch her breath something grabbed her from the ground.<br/>"Welcome home at last, Ranma," a guttural voice growled out as Ranma glanced about and recognized, from description and ancestral memory, the Abyss. "We have a lot of work for you to do..."<p>*******<p>Ranma-Chan snapped awake screaming, a sound that was quickly shut off as he recognized her surroundings. The panda was even asleep next to her, never even having heard his daughter.<br/>"A..a dream," she realized trying to catch her breath.<br/>Ranma hoped nobody had caught her transforming in the middle of the dream, but thought she was probably safe. She recalled the nobleman's confession yesterday and shivered.<br/>Somebody like that might just piss her off enough to do it, and then where would she be? What would make her different from all the soul-sucking monsters that she was related to?<p>*******<p>"Hey!" Akane snapped at Ranma. "Save some for the rest of us!"<br/>"You have quiet an appetite this morning, Ranma-kun," Kasumi noted as Ranma started on his third rack of lamb.<br/>"I skipped a meal yesterday," Ranma noted. Nabiki arched an eyebrow.<p>*******<p>"You look tired," Akane commented to Ranma-Kun as they began to near the hall. "Starting to get a little sick?"<br/>"I don't get sick," Ranma answered shortly. "I just didn't sleep very well." He added the last quietly.<br/>"Bad dreams, Saotome?" Nabiki asked. Ranma looked to her and narrowed his eyes. Did she know, and if so why hadn't she said anything?<br/>Ranma was saved from answering by the dull roar that introduced the oncoming morning horde.<br/>"Akane Tendo's here!" "With her fiancee!" "Saotome, get away from Ak-" The mob was quickly dispatched as Akane waded through them. Ranma followed still at her side and taking out his own mass of assaulters.<br/>Kuno suddenly jumped into view and charged forward yelling "Attack."<br/>"Kuno," Ranma said, sounding a little nauseous. Akane leaped up and came down in a kick to Kuno's face, taking him down. Ranma, on the other hand, simply vanished.<br/>"What..." Akane asked, looking around. "Did he run away?" She began to growl. "When I get my hands on him, he's going to wish he was never born! What a coward!" Akane stomped her way into the hall.<br/>Nabiki watched from an upper window and tapped her chin. From what she knew, Ranma could handle Kuno easily, however effective Kuno's ring was.<br/>"Very interesting," Nabiki said to herself. "What did happen at that duel."<p>*******<p>Ranma chided himself for teleporting like that, not only did it attract attention, it was damn tiring. He did have to avoid Kuno though. He couldn't trust himself not to get angry around the nobleman. He didn't want to deal with those problems at the moment,<br/>he didn't want to risk the chance that the nightmare was more accurate than other dreams.<br/>The martial artist left his temporary shelter and glanced back at the unconscious form of Kuno before moving to catch up with Akane. The girl turned to glare at her as came up to match her pace.<br/>"If you're going to get into my fights," Akane snapped. "Don't leave when the real trouble starts."<br/>"I'd rather not see Kuno right now," Ranma grumbled.<br/>"Oh, did you lose your duel?" Akane asked sharply.<br/>"There wasn't a duel!" Ranma retorted. "He gave me flowers and confessed his love for me." Ranma shivered at the thought.<br/>"Kuno is in love with your girl side?" Akane asked before breaking out in laughter.<br/>"Hey, what's so funny about that?" Ranma demanded, not really understanding the joke at all.<br/>"Well you're a man," Akane said. "Aren't you?"<br/>"Uh...yep, that's right," Ranma nod quickly. "What, do I look like a girl to you?"<br/>"Not at the moment," Akane smirked. ~But I'm beginning to wonder.~<p>*******<p>Nabiki leaned back to sip the wine from her goblet before leaning forward to begin reading again. Before she could, a stuffed panda toy landed on the book in front of her. Nabiki sighed and wondered if Kuno would ever learn humility and manners before various people and gods finally got fed up with him.<br/>"What's this?" Nabiki asked.<br/>"A present," came the simple answer from behind her.<br/>~A present? These things are hard to come by,~ Nabiki thought. She felt the cloth, filled with some soft material to give form and make it cozy as a pillow. ~Generally people like me have to settle for carved wooden dolls.~ "Why thank you, Little-Kuno.<br/>That was..."<br/>"Did I offer it to you Nabiki Tendo?" Kuno demanded.<br/>The world suddenly blackened around the priestess of Xellos, the few people around noticed her sudden change in mood and discreetly found somewhere else to be. The few people with intelligences beyond that of a goblin idiot anyway.<br/>"This gift is for the pig-tailed demon," Kuno declared. Nabiki's eyes popped wide as she spit her wine in Kuno's face.<br/>"Now look at what you made me do," Nabiki growled.<br/>"What I made you do?" Kuno repeated in disbelief.<br/>Nabiki smirked and plopped a small square of embroidered silk on the table. Kuno frowned and picked it up in curiousity. Immediately he was greeted with a minirature image of Ranma-chan bathing. Of course the action was bolstered by Nabiki's<br/>imagination to boost the sellability of it.<br/>"It'll last about a week," Nabiki said.<br/>"Ohhh!" Kuno gasped as he watched the illusion sensuously clean herself. "She is<br/>so...so...so...thorough."<br/>"She really does love those hot baths," Nabiki snickered. "Three hundred gold, you want it?"<br/>"For a mere week you charge three hundred!" Kuno demanded.<br/>"You want something permanent," Nabiki said. "You'll have to pay me a lot more than that." That was a lot more effort.<br/>"Done!" Kuno said, he set a small jewel on the table and continued. "I'll buy this one for now."<br/>"So what are you planning to do about my sister?" Nabiki asked.<br/>"What is there 'to do' about her?" Kuno asked, seriously.<br/>"You can't be thinking about copying Tenchi," Nabiki asked, eyes narrowed.<br/>"Of course," Kuno said in rebuttal. "Imitation is the greatest form of flattery. And both women are in desperate need of rescuing from the vile Saotome," Kuno declared. Nabiki stared at him for a moment.<br/>"Let me get something straight, Little-Kuno," Nabiki said.<br/>"Certainly," Kuno nodded.<br/>"You know she is a demon," Nabiki started, Kuno nodded. "She tried to put you in coma the last time you saw each other." Kuno nodded again. "And you are STILL want her?"<br/>"Of course," Kuno answered. "She is bound to this world to do Ranma Saotome's bidding. In truth she seems to me merely a demon in skin and not soul. Certainly she shall see my greatness for what it is and take her rightful place with Akane and I, as soon as I have brought the demoness to understand the power of the light."<br/>"And you think a stuffed panda is an appropriate gift to do that?" Nabiki asked. ~I didn't even know he knew what a panda was.~<br/>"Of course," Kuno insisted. "It is the heart of the matter that is important, not the body of it. At any rate, it is bear, I know not what manner of beast a panda is. The artisan made a similar mistake though."<br/>~Ah, that explains that.~ "And you STILL want my sister as well," Nabiki added. Most people would have noted the dangerous glint in her eye and the ice in her voice. Then again, this was Kuno.<br/>She smacked another square of silk on the table. Kuno picked it up and saw the image of Akane going through her "daily observances." Ever since Ranma had<br/>arrived, said observances had been the doom of more brick and wood than Nabiki had thought they owned.<br/>"Three hundred gold for one week," Nabiki said.<br/>"Sold!" Kuno shouted.<p>*******<p>"Ranma," Nabiki called out as she found her family's guest, as usual, in the audience hall. He never did go much deeper into the keep than that. "Can I speak to you for a moment?"<br/>"About what?" Ranma asked supiciously. Akane turned toward the conversation as well.<br/>"I noticed you didn't go out last night," Nabiki said.<br/>"What's the big deal about that?" Akane wondered. Though she noticed Ranma freeze.<br/>"Maybe you're feeling a little peckish?" Nabiki smirked as Ranma winced.<br/>~Now I definitely know something's going on here,~ Akane thought and excused herself from Yuka and Sayuri's company to follow her sister and Ranma.<p>*******<p>"What do you want?" Ranma asked.<br/>"You seem to be starving," Nabiki said. "So I wondered if you'd be interested in a hunt." Nabiki shrugged. Ranma paused in confusion, did she know or didn't she? The Tendo's thoughts weren't any clearer, reading Metalliums always gave him a headache anyway.<br/>"You're going on a hunt?" Ranma asked.<br/>"Yes," Nabiki said. "But I need to do something first, the other member of our party should be along any moment."<br/>"Uh huh," Ranma nodded and looked around cautiously as Nabiki walked away. "So who else is going on this thing?"<br/>"Saotome," a voice behind him drawled. Ranma froze and turned around slowly.<br/>"Kuno, I don't want to..." Ranma caught the stuffed panda as Kuno and stared at it. "Hey, this is kind of..." Ranma stopped himself, remembering that guys generally didn't go around calling things kawaii. He didn't particularly understand that, but he didn't<br/>particularly understand a lot of things that men and women did.<br/>"Tell me where you keep her!" Kuno demanded. "Answer me! Where!"<br/>"Say again?" Ranma asked.<br/>"'When I want to talk to the pig-tailed demoness, I talk to Ranma,'" Kuno continued. "Quoth Nabiki Tendo. Now tell me what magical device you keep her in?"<br/>"I'd forget her if I were you," Ranma snapped, angrily tossing back the bear.<br/>"What?" Kuno demanded.<br/>"Keep chasing m...her, and it'll get painful," Ranma walked away from the shocked swordsman.<br/>~What...What...?~ Kuno stood in complete shock for several seconds.<br/>Ranma reached the structures of the keep a few steps away and turned a corner. There was a sudden splash of water as a servant emptied a soap bucket.<br/>"Oh, sorry, sir," the man said nervously, backing away cautiously. Ranma waved his hand dismissively.<br/>"No problem," he said shrugging. ~Damn, that almost hit me,~ Ranma thought. ~That would have been...~ Another splash of water dropped onto him and Ranma, now female, groaned. She took a moment to way off keeping the act up and then imagined what Akane might do to her if she found out. ~This is just annoying, I can handle it.~<br/>~Never see her again...~ Kuno continued thinking, on the edge of processing the sentence. He rushed after the man he perceived as the tormentor of his loves. "What do you mean? Ranma Saotome!" The pig-tailed adventurer was no where to be seen.<br/>"So! Quick to run, are you?" he slashed out and struck down a a tree. He turned at the sound of someone thumping into the ground.<br/>"Ohhh!" Ranma-chan shouted in surprise, as she hit the ground, presenting warding figures with her hands.<br/>"You...you're...the demoness!" Kuno gasped in surprise. He dropped to his knees, arms extended to hug the red-headed girl. "How I've missed y-*"<br/>"Back off!" Ranma snapped from her seated position, fist in the jerk's face. It stopped Kuno for all of a second.<br/>"I shall never let you go!" Kuno shouted as he glomped onto the irritated young woman, who briefly, valiently and futilely fought against fainting. Kuno held her out as he felt her go limp and then shook her. "Oh she is overcome by the power of my<br/>presence."<br/>~Can't have that now, can we,~ Nabiki thought as she walked up behind Ranma, Kuno didn't even seem to notice until she upended a kettle over the redheads<br/>head. When there was no sudden cry of pain. ~I would have thought that would be hot enough, he seemed interested in avoiding getting burnt when he showed<br/>up, hmm.~<br/>Kuno looked up and then, when he looked down, the red-haired demoness was gone to be replaced by a very cross looking Ranma.<br/>"Hey! Leggo!" Ranma snapped a quick kick into Kuno's face. "Got the picture now, idiot? I'm leaving."<br/>"Hold, Saotome!" Kuno shouted. "Return my demoness at once! Sir Kuno shall not be decieved by the tricks of such dark sorcery." Ranma flinched in complete disbelief before whirling back to face Kuno.<br/>"Listen, you idiot!"<br/>~Not quite surprised,~ Nabiki sighed. "I guess we'll have to spell it out to him. Okay, Little-Kuno, these are the facts. That demon-woman, Her body, her soul, belong to him. Do you know what I mean?"<br/>There was an audible sound as Kuno's mind leaped to various conclusions.<br/>~I knew about the spell,~ Kuno thought. ~But her soul and her BODY!~ He whirled on Ranma, slashing outward with a strike Ranma almost casually leaped over. "TYRANT!" This time Nabiki saw a flash of black power as Ranma landed on the nearest tree, and crouched, as if the tree were a level floor.<br/>"I don't think you've got it!" Ranma shouted.<br/>"Silence! I can see it, though demon."<p>*******<p>A scantily clad Ranma-succubus abased herself before a bestial Ranma-kun.<p>*******<p>"HEY! I don't look like that!" Ranma shouted. "And HOW could ANYONE mix THOSE colors?"<br/>"Don't break in on my imagination!" Kuno demanded.<p>*******<p>"I have a special task for you, my pretty," Ranma-kun leered.<br/>"Yes, master," Ranma-succubus sighed reluctantly. Then Ranma carried her behind a throne.<br/>"You are mine to do with as I please!" Ranma growled. Ranma-succubus cried out, and the bloom of a nightshade broke off and fell to the ground.<p>*******<p>"Oh, how terrible!" Kuno moaned. "DIABOLIST!" Kuno swung out, and took another swipe, cutting down another tree. Ranma leaped away from his falling perch.<br/>"What the hell are you talking about!" Ranma shouted. Nobody noticed Akane come around the corner.<br/>"What's this?" Akane wondered.<br/>"I shall free her, I shall fell you!" Kuno was ranting, as Nabiki watched with a curious look on her face.<br/>"Oh yeah!" Ranma shouted, still in the air. "So if you lose you'll forget her! Right?" Ranma caught Kuno's bokken, and then used it for leverage to kick the swordsman. As Ranma flipped back and landed he saw a couple pieces of cloth fly out of Kuno's tunic.<br/>~Uh oh,~ Nabiki thought as Ranma snatched the cloths out of the air. ~At least I got paid.~<br/>"What's this a handk..." Ranma's jaw dropped as he watched an image of himself, well herself anyway, bathing. At least the actions the illusion of her were taking resembled bathing. "HEY!" Ranma was cut off as Kuno's bokken slashed in under his guard.<br/>Akane gasped as Ranma staggered backwards from the blow.<br/>~He felt that?~ Nabiki gasped as Ranma regained his feet, standing wobbily. ~That weapon has no enchantment! Perhaps...~ She appraised Kuno again. Nabiki quietly called on Xellos, a soft purple glow suffusing her.<br/>Ranma meanwhile was again snatching the two squares of cloth out of the air, while neatly dodging Kuno's strikes.<br/>"This, This..." Ranma muttered staring at the illusion his female form doing her act, still dodging Kuno. ~Just what I need, something to encourage Mother.~ He briefly considered letting out his full power and changing to his natural form, that wound would heal faster for one thing. Nabiki probably already knew about him anyway.<br/>"You look elsewhere in the midst battle!" Kuno said quietly and launched forward. "You do not take me seriously!" Ranma dodged backwards, rolling to a headstand just in front of Akane.<br/>~Akane?~ Ranma blinked as Akane stared down at him. For a brief moment she looked worried, then she started to frown. ~She was worried about me?~ Ranma<br/>resisted the urge to preen, any more than usual anyway.<br/>"I think you should know, that..." Akane paused irritated by the information she was about to give him. "...when Sir Kuno fights a male opponent, he is very skilled."<br/>~What, she thinks I can't take care of myself?~ Ranma forgot that she had been worried about him as his mind processed an appropriately sarcastic remark. "And I think you should know that the crotch in your armor is giving out."<br/>"Go back and die!" Akane shouted, booting Ranma back at Kuno. Ranma flipped around in air, almost as if he were born to maneuver in the air, and angled down at Kuno.<br/>"This game ends now!" Kuno shouted, a glow of power surrounded him.<br/>"Huh?" Ranma hesitated a moment as he saw the magic build around Kuno, a soft purple eating away at some magical layer about him. First that ring got brighter, then he began picking out more magic.<br/>"I was right!" Nabiki shouted. "A cloaking spell!" As the cloaking spell faded away Ranma watched a sudden surge in power, then the bokken launched forward in a sudden burst of out and out speed.<br/>"Yikes!" Ranma desperately dodged, feeling the passage of the blade just moments after he moved. Behind him the corner of the building Akane was standing by began to crack and shatter.<br/>"Akane, he's going to bring that building down!" Nabiki shouted. Akane dodged to the side as Nabiki's prediction proved true and the small stone shed crumpled, almost on top of her.<br/>"Akane, get out of the way!" Ranma shouted. Akane turned away from the rubble that nearly collapsed atop her to see Kuno smiling victoriously as he slashed<br/>down.<br/>"Eyes front, idiot!" Akane shouted. Ranma dodged the now virtually glowing bokken and inclined his body as he turned to face Kuno. His foot seemed to pass along inches from Kuno's body.<br/>Kuno gave an amused smile as Ranma followed the kick into a leap and landed firmly on his feet. The moment Ranma touched the ground Kuno fell over.<br/>~Pain,~ Ranma thought quietly as he stood standing stoically.<br/>"I didn't see any magic there," Nabiki said, impressed. "How did you...?" Akane walked over and flipped the unconscious man over.<br/>"Oh my," Akane said. "Each blow has hit a vulnerable spot."<br/>"You kicked him," Nabiki gasped. "I never even saw it!"<br/>"I guess Sir Kuno didn't have much," Ranma suggested as he stretched to try to work some of the pain out. "Did he?"<br/>"What do you mean?" Akane asked levely. "You took a hit too, didn't you?"<br/>"Oh that," Ranma said, trying another trick and placing his hands back behind his head.<br/>"Right here," Akane indicated the tear in his shirt. "Is it really all right?"<br/>"Doesn't even itch," Ranma lied, just before Akane poked him. Funny thing about overly reactive senses, they generally work both way. Akane flinched backward as Ranma cried out and dropped to his knees crying.<br/>"Sir Kuno doesn't have much, eh!" Akane snapped angrily.<br/>"Except a blessed weapon, magical vestment, and one really nice enchanted ring besides the enspelled items," Nabiki listed off. "Must be from his sister."<br/>"Anyway, what distracted you from the fight?" Akane asked calmly. Ranma paused before handing Akane the cloth holding the Tendo woman's illusion. "What the..? What are you doing with this!"<br/>"What am I do...? KUNO had them!" Ranma shouted back angrily, he wondered if he had imagined the look of worry on her face earlier.<br/>"Nabiki!" Akane snapped.<br/>"Just making a little money on the side," Nabiki said in a disarming manner.<br/>"My own sister," Akane continued in disbelief.<br/>"At least its not as bad as this other one," Ranma said. Akane froze and growled, before rounding on Ranma holding another square of cloth. He shivered as he furtively tore the square apart. "There that horrible image gone forever." Ranma's back was turned so he couldn't see Akane growling.<br/>"Akane," Nabiki started. "That one wasn't...nevermind." The air was filled with<br/>screaming as a red glowing hammer began bashing Ranma and a raging priestess helped it by folding him about.<p>Back to Martial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition
