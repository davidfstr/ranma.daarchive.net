</div><br/>TitleMartial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition/Title<p>Betrayal<p>"Hey," the bartender called out. "Rurouni, over here." Ranma growled, but caught the man's nervous thoughts and walked over to the bar. She knew she shouldn't have gone in without the cloak, she actually finds a new bar and she's marked as a fighter within two minutes.<br/>"I ain't rurouni," Ranma said firmly, but she sat down at the bar anyway. "Rurouni carry around those clubs."<br/>"But the scars," the bartender said. Ranma snorted in irritation.<br/>"Ya think I did this on purpose?" Ranma asked. "Besides, it ain't like most rurouni are into self-mutilation anyway."<br/>"So what are you then?" the man asked. Ranma didn't feel like answering, besides she "heard" some coming up behind that would do it for her.<br/>"She's a lovely young woman of course." Ranma glanced up at the speaker. She could swear she never saw him before but there was still something familiar. "Do you mind if I sit here?" Behind the kind, more-than-perfect face and gentle words Ranma found nothing suspicious. This wasn't the kind of person she hunted, but if he wanted to sit with her, fine.<br/>"Go ahead," Ranma gestured to the stool. "Its a public place."<br/>"Thank you my lady," the man said pleasantly. "Bartender, serve us something appropriate this woman's great beauty."<br/>"You ain't my type," Ranma muttered, blushing in spite of herself. She turned back to the bartender as he set down a pair of wine glasses. "Did you want something?"<br/>"No," the bartender said. "Just wanted to show my respect for Kenshin's following."<br/>"Ahh," Ranma said nodding. "Good bunch."<br/>"I'm certain that you are just as strong a person as many of them," the would-be suitor said. Ranma laughed and shook her head.<br/>~Doesn't look like I'm getting any hunting done tonight,~ Ranma said.<p>********<p>"Thanks for the drinks," Ranma said, totally unaffected by the alchohol. She had drunk sparingly, but more because she didn't like alcohol than any other reason. "But I gotta go."<br/>"Perhaps I should accompany you to your home," suggested Mikado, that was the name he had given Ranma. Ranma considered it. Being seen escorted through the streets would do a lot to make her look desirable and vulnerable, if alone. She shook her head though, she wasn't going to lead on anybody she didn't want for lunch.<br/>"That's okay," Ranma said. "I can run fast and jump high." She bit back a wince at the statement. She could do a lot more than that.<br/>"Perhaps I'll see you tomorrow night..." he said. "...excuse me, you never gave me your name."<br/>"Nope," Ranma said walking through the tavern's room, still loud even this late at night.<p>********<p>"Gotcha old man!" Ranma shouted cheerfully. In the next moment he was landing clear of the pond while his father dropped into it with a tremendous splash. He dusted himself off and walked into the house towards breakfast.<br/>"What are you so cheerful about?" Akane asked.<br/>"It's just nice to know not everybody in the world's a jerk," Ranma said, sitting down, and ignoring the indignant panda flashing signs behind him.<br/>"What?" Akane asked, blinking. "What would you know about that?"<br/>"I'm not talking about me, you idiot," Ranma snapped. Kasumi and Nabiki watched Ranma eating, most notably the amount he was eating.<p>********<p>"You did not find...sustenance last night?" Kasumi asked Ranma, catching before he moved to catch up with Akane and Nabiki. "You ate quite a bit."<br/>"Well, some guy showed up and ruined it," Ranma said. "Kept buying me drinks and stuff. Almost too bad that he seemed like a nice guy."<br/>"I see," Kasumi said. She considered the situation. "You are being careful?"<br/>"What, you think I'm gonna run across him again?" Ranma asked. He shrugged and walked out to join Akane.<br/>~Well, if it doesn't work between him and Akane,~ Kasumi thought reluctantly. She went back inside and noticed Nabiki standing at the gate and watching Ranma catch up with Akane. "Nabiki, won't you be late."<br/>"I'll be fine," Nabiki said.<br/>"As you wish," Kasumi said, she walked into the house. A few minutes later there was an explosion from the courtyard. Kasumi walked out there to find an ash covered Nabiki standing in a circle of ash, her eye twitching.<br/>"Are you okay Nabiki?" she asked.<br/>"Ouch..." Nabiki fell back to the ground.<br/>"I suppose that you won't be going to court today then," Kasumi said.<p>********<p>"Are you feeling okay?" Akane asked Ranma.<br/>"What do you mean?" Ranma asked.<br/>"You're acting strange," Akane explained.<br/>"What do you mean by that?"<br/>"I don't know," Akane said, deadpan, as Ranma fluffed another pillow and put it behind her. "Maybe you feel guilty about something." Ranma froze and snorted, shaking his head.<br/>"Like that's possible," he said and stomped away.<p>********<p>"The main temple?" Kasumi repeated. Nabiki nodded. "Isn't that dangerous in current state?"<br/>"Its neutral ground for Metalliums," Nabiki said. "And I have an idea on how to get Lina to let up without annoying Xellos, but I need to use the library there to form an actual plan."<br/>"Be careful anyway," Kasumi said. Nabiki started collecting her travel clothes and nodded before heading out the door.<br/>"I wish I didn't have to go right now though," Nabiki said, glancing toward Ranma. "But access is limited." Kasumi looked back at the martial artist practicing katas around the koi pond.<br/>"I see," Kasumi said. That was probably as much as Nabiki could say out right, especially if she wasn't certain what was going on herself. Nabiki nodded and walked out the door.<p>********<p>"Ranma!" Ryouga shouted. "Prepare to die!" Ryouga descended on Ranma from the roof and immediately launched into a flurry of strikes. Ranma barely dodged one punch, then blocked another. He broke off contact and frowned at Ryouga.<br/>~He's been training since last time,~ Ranma thought. "Would you just leave me alone!" Ranma shouted angrily.<br/>"I will not let you get away with whatever evil plan you have in store," Ryouga shouted.<br/>"What evil plan!" Ranma demanded. Ryouga charged forward again and Ranma irritably returned to his defense, still refusing to strike back. "I ain't doing nothing!"<br/>"That's a laugh," Ryouga shouted. "You're going out every night and always expertly evading my pursuit." Ranma blocked and held a couple blows and stared at Ryouga.<br/>"You're following me?" Ranma asked in shock.<br/>"Well..." Ryouga started embarrassed. "That is...Of course I'm following you! Why I'm nervous about saying it?" Ranma blinked a couple of times and then started growling.<br/>"LEAVE ME ALONE!" Ranma shouted as he pulled Ryouga off balance. As the celestial was still working to regain his guard Ranma struck in with a short series of fast punches. Then Ranma's knee came up with a bright flash of power. While Ryouga's eyes were crossing the half-demon shoulder tossed him across the courtyard, into the stone wall.<br/>Ryouga hit with a groan and then slid to the ground. Ranma stared after the momentarily senseless celestial, breathing heavily and still glaring. Then he blinked and stared at Ryouga coming too. He almost calmed down and then was suddenly angry again.<br/>"That's what you deserve," Ranma shouted, before turning and leaving the scene quickly. Akane came out of the house in time for Ranma to pass her.<br/>"What the...?" Akane glanced Ryouga standing up wobbily and then back at where Ranma vanished. "Why does he look like he lost?"<br/>"Which way did he go," a squeaky voice asked. Akane turned back to Ryouga and then pointed in direction Ranma went. "Thanks, I'll pound him into the dirt now." Ryouga wobbily wandered off and hapharzardly jumped over the wall, instead of going through the house after Ranma.<p>********<p>"Little Ruby," Mikado called out as Ranma entered the tavern. She sighed exasperatefly. This had been happening off and on, mostly on, for a week now, why did he keep having to choose taverns she was going to. She felt it should make her nervous, but she couldn't quite pin down why.<br/>"Mikado," Ranma called out cheerfully in a moment. "What a surprise to see you here."<p>********<p>Mikado slammed his fist against the wall in frustration as Ranma walked of the tavern again. He barely noticed when Azusa slid up next to him.<br/>"She's not buying it," the blonde chirped playfully in draconic. She looked to Mikado and shook her head. "Tsk tsk, you told the mistress this would be easy."<br/>"I was wrong," Mikado admitted in the same langauage. "I'm doing everything I can just to keep the half-breed from figuring out what I am."<br/>"The Mistress's patience is not infinite," Azusa reminded him.<br/>"We should not talk about this in this place," Mikado said.<br/>"Do you think these thugs know the tongue of the dragons?" Azusa asked. She shook her head. "What do you plan to do about her latest project?"<br/>"The girl is in safekeeping," Mikado said. "But if you mean the half-breed, I shall try something my forceful if this continues." They failed to notice someone watching them from the corners.<p>********<p>"Should you be doing that so close to the water?" Akane asked as she approached Ranma.<br/>"Hmmm?" Ranma asked without turning attention away from his kata. Then somebody pushed him sideways and he had to clamor for purchase on the slick stones. Right up until the point he fell into the pound. "What did you do that for? Damn berserker."<br/>"Good," Akane said. "I was missing the idiot."<br/>"Ehh?" Ranma blinked at the girl smiling at him there, crouched at the edge. Akane suddenly felt a hand grip her ankle and then she was in the pool as well. "Want to play games huh?"<br/>"Ohh!" Akane mock growled. "You idiot!" She splashed the redhead in retaliation.<br/>"Okay," Ranma said, smirking. "That means war!" She splashed Akane back. Splashing turned to a mock spar after a few minutes, and that switched into tickling.<br/>"I give! I give!" Akane yelled through fits of laughter. "You win this round, idiot." Akane said, breathlessly looking up.<br/>"You couldn't be..." Ranma stopped as she calmed down and noticed how close her face was to Akane. An image of Mikado flashed through her head for some reason, but that wasn't why the redhead jumped away from Akane suddenly. "Uh...Ryouga could be back anytime." Then she vanished. Akane stared at the empty space irritably.<br/>"What does Ryouga have to do with anything?" Akane wondered. She stood up and shook her head, she was getting tired of Ranma's vanishing act. She was shaking herself dry and walking back to the house when their former position suddenly occured to her. "That pervert!"<p>********<p>Ranma-kun took a deep breath and then released it slowly. Letting his guard down like that was a bad idea. Akane wasn't interested in him, that was obvious. Though something was saying that wasn't so obvious. She and Ryouga got along so fine, they could have each other. There was always Mikado...<br/>"Where'd that come from?" Ranma asked, considering the thought. He recalled the phantom image of Mikado he had seen when he noticed his earlier position with Akane. There was something incomplete about it, more like a faltering illusion than a true thought or memory.<br/>Ranma considered following that thought, but suddenly lost interest. There was nothing strange about Mikado, the guy was nice, but he didn't have any skills or powers that Ranma could notice. Distrust got rather tiring after a while. He was definitely surprised at that thought, but again lost interest in the anomally, shrugging it away.<br/>"Let 'em have each other," he muttered again, and then jumped off the roof down to the road.<p>********<p>"Little Ruby," Mikado said, catching up to her. Ranma turned around in surprise, the man had never actually followed her outside before. "I really must insist on escorting you home."<br/>"I've told you I can take care of myself," Ranma said firmly.<br/>"Well," Mikado said. "If I can't have the pleasure of your company for the remainder of the knight, perhaps a farewell kiss?" Ranma froze and looked at the ground for a long second.<br/>~This will be difficult if she doesn't fall for it,~ Mikado thought.<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said. "That doesn't seem like too much of a problem." She held out her hand and was surprised when Mikado took it in his and pulled her closer. "Now listen, Mikado, I didn't say..."<br/>Ranma's protest was cut off as Mikado kissed her. Ranma actually felt herself swooning as he kissed her, being drawn in and overwhelmed. She closed her eyes softly and leaned upward into him. She felt she could just faint away and let this man take her home.<br/>Then something stabbed into her leg.<br/>"Ouch!" Ranma shouted, looking down at the arrow in her leg. She still felt woozy from that kiss. "Mikado look out, there's som..." She turned to see great batwings sitting on the back of readily recognizeable form. A demon form. Ranma's eyes widened as she took stock of how she felt, without a mind-clouding spell, and then they narorwed with a growl.<br/>"She figured you out, Mikkie," a woman's voice said in an, I-told-you-so manner.<br/>"BASTARD!" Ranma yelled, charging forward at the other demon, despite how hard t seemed to just be able to breathe. The surprised incubus stumbled away from the enraged half-demon. There was a chant of draconic and a flash of light, and Ranma suddenly found herself facing a pack of wild dogs.<br/>"Have fun!" a blonde said cheerfully as she ran up to Mikado and grabbed him. In another flash of light they were gone. Her object of rage taken away Ranma felt the full impact of the life drain start to come.<br/>~Have to make this quick,~ she gasped. ~I need help...~ The flames from the street torches flickered, almost in response to her thoughts. Moments later the street was lighted with a much brighter fire.<br/>Ranma limped away from the vanishing dogs and collapsed against a wall for a moment. Such a kiss as that would not have been a serious problem for a human, to get really hurt they would have had to go much farther. For Ranma, however, it suddenly felt as if she had not eaten in a long time. The adrenaline of the fight was wearing off, and she was feeling it all now.<br/>"Still need help..." she gasped. Ranma jumped into the night sky and unfurled her wings, thinking clearly enough to know that she could glide further than she could walk. Provided she could get the height necessary.<p>********<p>Akane stretched awake and began her daily routine. It wasn't long before she was walking downstairs and seeing Kasumi start preparing the morning meal. Her eldest sister turned toward her and then sighed in disappointment. Akane crinkled her eyes in confusion.<br/>"Is something wrong?" Akane asked.<br/>"I thought you might be Ranma," Kasumi said.<br/>"Please don't tell me you're falling for that freak," Akane returned. Kasumi looked at her sharply.<br/>"Akane, watch your tongue," Kasumi said. "I believe Ryoko warned you about acting like that." Akane blushed in frustration and embarrassment.<br/>"Yeah," she agreed. "But what, is Ranma not home yet?"<br/>"No, he isn't," Kasumi said worriedly. "He never hunts this late."<br/>"Where does he hunt?" Akane asked. She knew she should have followed him at least once.<br/>"I'm not certain," Kasumi said.<br/>"Well, there aren't that many places to..." Akane started opening the door and almost ran into a message runner from Master Tofu's. They were recent additions to the clinic, and had replaced the woman who had returned to some family duties. Akane had met the two girls, she thought they were girls, once or twice already. They were always heavily wrapped up no matter what the weather, and now was no exception.<br/>"Aiyah!" the girl shouted. "Akane almost hit Lin Lin. Very bad thing if Akane defeat Lin Lin."<br/>"Does Master Tofu need anything?" Akane asked irritably, the last time she had found the twins' speech patterns were amusing. Not at the moment however.<br/>"Yes," Lin Lin nodded under her thick wrappings, Akane assumed they were heavily scared or something. "Master have patient in very bad way. Medicine no good. Wizardry no good. Send Lin Lin for Lady Kasumi to come."<br/>"Oh my," Kasumi said. "What is the matter?"<br/>"Tofu say woman run into demon," Lin Lin said. "Gray skin, hard breathe..." she had to think about her next phrase. "Much...wet..." she nodded. "Much wet."<br/>"I shall be right there," Kasumi said quickly.<br/>"I'll go with you," Akane said, already planning on leaving for a quick run anyway.<br/>"Master say you know woman," Lin Lin said. Both sisters froze immediately.<br/>"Nabiki," they whispered, and Kasumi hastened to collect her spell materials.<p>********<p>"Master go see patient," Ran Ran said as Kasumi and Akane walked in behind Lin Lin. "No safe for woman he here with Lady Kasumi." Lin Lin and Ran Ran laughed a little at that while Akane winced and Kasumi looked merely confused. It was a musical sound, almost elven. Akane wondered what they looked like under the wrappings.<br/>"Sick woman this way," Lin Lin said, leading Kasumi along. "Is bad, must hurry."<br/>"Of course," Kasumi said, sounding actually somewhat impatient to be there already. Akane moved behind. She hadn't quite learned how to call for healing yet, the prayer was similar to the one she used to call for injury, but she would do what she could to help her sisters.<br/>"In this room," Lin Lin pointed. Ran Ran moved to join her.<br/>"No worry," Ran Ran said. "Woman is not bad." Akane blinked at that. Why would they assure her that her sister was not bad. When they opened the door, she saw the reason for the assurances.<br/>Laying on the cot was an unconscious bat-winged girl. Her face was crinkled up in pain or exhaustion. Her skin did have an unhealthy grey pallor, and she was drenched in sweat. But what Akane noticed most of all was that the demon-woman struggling to breathe on the cot was Ranma.<p>Back to Martial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition
