</div><br/>TitleMartial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition/Title<p>Accidental Pawn<p>"I still don't get it," Ranma-chan said, shaking herself dry and seriously considered removing the spell on herself.<br/>"What," Akane asked, irritated at the wanderer. "What isn't there to get, they're both crazy." They were on their way home after an irritating session at court involving Kuno and his sister, the same priestess that Akane was supposed to fight.<br/>"Yeah, but I expect that of a priestess of Ayeka," Ranma said. ~Or Ryoko.~ "But I just don't get why she tolerates her brother." She paused for a moment and looked around.<br/>"I don't know how anyone tolerates him," Akane said. "But I know there's no way I'm gonna let that stuck up Jurain beat me in this match." She turned back to look at Ranma and noted the other girl's watchful attitude. "What's up?"<br/>"Somebody was watching me," Ranma said. She touched her scars. "Something about my face." She frowned and started walking along, checking back over her shoulder.<br/>Akane blinked, feeling a slight chill. She knew Ranma understood the trick of reading minds, but sometimes the martial artist's powers seemed to be pulled up to naturally to be just a spell. It was somewhat disturbing actually.<br/>~Musta caught me watching,~ Ranma thought. ~Too much background.~ She glanced back at Akane. "Come on, I'm sure the jerk's missing you right now."<p>********<p>"Are you certain?" one of the men asked.<br/>"I saw it," the man said. "A pair of scars forming an 'x' on her face."<br/>"Anybody can have that," someone said. "Half his worshippers do."<br/>"She had red hair," the witness said, continuing. "She looked like she stepped out a picture of the Bandit Killer, and with those scars." He shook his head. "I don't believe in coincidence when it comes to someone that looks like the gods. Especially a resemblance to more than one."<br/>"'Her'," the third of the group noted questioningly. "Are you certain. There is no reason for any of them to even know of her existence, much less be looking for her."<br/>"Even if it was known," the first said again. "We are well shielded from magic and unfriendly Gods."<br/>"It was an Outsider," the one who had seen the woman said. "I'm sure of it." In truth he had nothing to go on but the appearance the woman had given him. Somehow she had noticed when he started watching her. "And she was with a priestess of Ryoko."<br/>"Both of them," said a feminine voice. There was a snort. The three men turned to a woman in the shadows. "My my, they want this kid badly, don't they?"<br/>"M...mistress," one of the men stammered.<br/>"Just keep an eye on the girl," the woman said. "I don't want to lose another weapon."<br/>"What about the berserker and this 'demon' Barth 'saw?'" one of the men asked. "You really can't expect us to act normal with them hanging arou-" The man was cut off as he suddenly turned into solid stone.<br/>"Anyone else want to question me?" the woman asked. There was no response.<br/>"Good," she smiled. ~Time to test the playing field.~ The shadows deepened around her, swallowing the woman's already indistinct form. When they pulled back she was gone.<p>********<p>"Are you going to keep that crazy woman away from my priestess?" Ryoko demanded.<br/>"What about that pet demon you have distracting my priestess?" Ayeka demanded. Ryoko blinked.<br/>"You have to be joking," Ryoko said. "Didn't you notice who that demon was?"<br/>"Well, he did seem familiar," Ayeka noted.<br/>"Ranma," Ryoko said. Ayeka looked at her in disbelief.<br/>"That is not possible," Ayeka said. "Ranma is just a little bit of a thing." She held her hand to about waist level.<br/>"Ayeka, how long has it been since you last saw Ranma?" Tenchi asked wearily.<br/>"It was just a little bit ago," Ayeka said. "Around when we last saw Nodoka. That was...eight years ago. Oh! They grow up so quickly."<br/>"So you see..." Ryoko started.<br/>"How dare you use that sweet little child in your schemes," Ayeka accused.<br/>"ARRGGG!" Ryoko shouted.<p>********<p>"This must be one of the pair she wants us to test," a masculine voice said. A smaller figure next to him nodded.<br/>"The young man is an Outsider," she said. "Like you, not the Mistress."<br/>"Yeah, I feel it too," the taller figure smiled. "I shouldn't worry about him, but maybe we should take the priestess out of action for a time."<br/>"Oh, you plan to approach her?" the young woman asked.<br/>"Not with him there," he said. "I leave this to you. Something accidental."<br/>"Perhaps, I'll send one of my pretties after her," the woman smiled.<p>********<p>"Where is he?" Akane wondered angrily. "I should have known he'd get lost."<br/>"You actually expected him to be reliable?" Ranma asked tartly, dropping into view. "I told you the jerk is never around when you neeed him."<br/>"So how am I supposed to train then?" Akane asked. "I have to be ready for tomorrow."<br/>"Yeah, I wouldn't want you to lose tomorrow," Ranma said. "That's for sure."<br/>"Listen you, I'm not fighting for you," Akane snapped.<br/>"I didn't say you were," Ranma retorted. "But I wouldn't want to disa..." He stopped and looked around the dojo.<br/>"What is it now?" Akane asked. She thought about calling on her own magic to see what the cursed sorcerer-martial artist felt.<br/>"Mew," the quiet sound seemed thunderous in the quiet of the dojo. Akane turned to see a small cat sitting just outside the dojo. It seemed very uncomfortable in the cold of the night.<br/>"C..!" Ranma yelled next to her, and by the time Akane turned around he was plastered against the wall.<br/>"What's wrong with you?" Akane asked, she shook her head, confused. She forgot about casting a spell as the situation turned more confusing. Ranma was cowering against the wall. The young man didn't seem like he had heard her, focus wide-eyed on the cat, which had for some reason not crossed into the dojo from outside. "Look, I'll get rid of the cat, okay,"<br/>She walked towards the mewling cat and felt a small sense of reluctance as she moved to pick it up.<br/>"A..A...Akane," Ranma stuttered. "G..get away from it."<br/>"It's just a cat," Akane said, hesitantly. She stepped out of the dojo and the mewling, sad looking cat instantly seemed to become a rabid beast, leaping up at her. "What the..!"<br/>Akane lifted her arm up in front of the little attacker and it tore at her arm rather than her throat. She tossed it away from her into the courtyard and watched as it landed and started to bound back towards her. Her torn hand and arm made it difficult to cast an appropriate spell in defense. She growled and got ready to crush the little thing as it jumped at her. Something slammed her out of the cat's path.<br/>"Get it offa me!" Ranma yelled.<br/>Akane whirled to see him shielding his face and curled up as the little monster clawed at his back. Akane snapped out with her uninjured arm and grabbed the cat, snapping its neck. The small animal turned briefly limp in her grasp before its body faded into mist.<br/>"A summoning," she said irritably. "That's why it wouldn't come in the house." Akane knelt down next to the still shivering Ranma. "It's gone Ranma, it's gone."<br/>"Akane, what happened?" Kasumi demanded as she rushed in from the house.<br/>"Somebody sent something to attack me," Akane said angrily. She showed her arm to Kasumi.<br/>"A devil," Ranma muttered. "Just like be...a devil."<p>********<p>"Well, so much for your 'pretty'," the 'man' said dryly.<br/>"That little bitch killed my Jean-Pierre!" the woman huffed angrily. "I won't be able to call him back for a day or more!"<br/>"I might have to do something about the little demon after all," her partner responded. "Or half-demon, I should say." ~If this is who I think it is...~ He smiled evilly.<p>********<p>"The spell is not working," Kasumi said. "I'm afraid this won't be healed before tomorrow."<br/>"But I can't fight like this!" Akane protested. "That Kodachi is behind this, she wants me to forfeit the match!"<br/>"Not Ayeka's style and you know it," Nabiki said. "This was something else."<br/>"I don't believe you, boy," Genma's voice carried from the courtyard. "After all my training you become a quivering useless mass over something so trivial."<br/>"Shut up, old man!" Ranma snapped. A moment later Genma was seen landing in the pool as a cloaked form that had to be Ranma leaped over the wall.<br/>"Where do you think you're going!" Akane demanded loudly, moving past the pond and panda.<br/>"Hunting!" Ranma's angry voice carried back, already a fair distance away.<br/>"What's wrong with him?" Akane wondered. "First that cat scaring him spineless now this."<br/>"He was saying it was a devil like before," Kasumi said. "And that no one would heal the scars this time." The elder sister moved to stand next to Akane, Nabiki moved behind her and turned to look at Genma in the pool.<br/>"Why do I get the feeling you know something about this?" she asked.<br/>*I don't know what you're talking about.* Genma's sign read. Nabiki arched an eyebrow as Akane and Kasumi turned around.<br/>"Genma," Soun said grimmly, appearing out of no where. "What have you done?"<br/>"I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble reading that," Nabiki said. "Maybe a little light would..."<br/>*NO!NO!NO!* Genma's sign declared loudly. Of course everytime Nabiki had so much tried to cast a cantrip with her wizardly magic there was a loud bang.<br/>"Then you might want to explain what's wrong with Ranma," Nabiki said.<p>********<p>Ranma sat in the tavern and tried to ignore the feeling of the blood dripping down her back. No one had come near her yet. All the thoughts she was picking up seemed to just pass her over. Before she came to Nerima she could turn the eyes of any man that saw her, and make women swoon in her male form. Now she was hiding in a cloak and the only attention she got was a cautious appraisal.<br/>She was a threat now, not an object of beauty. Of course, she had always been a threat to some. Now they just seemed to know it.<br/>~Such a pity,~ someone thought. ~Such a flower sitting all by herself.~ Normally Ranma would have been suspicious of such attention to a girl that was hiding in a cloak hard to see. Desperation made her somewhat reckless though.<br/>Ranma glanced in the direction of the thought and saw a tall man striding toward her purposefully. She scanned his surface thoughts enough to realize that he was the type of pervert she was used to preying on. She smiled in anticipation as the man approached her.<br/>"Hey kid," somebody said, plopping down next to her. The tall man frowned and backed away. Ranma growled and turned to see Lina in the chair next to her. "You know, you won't get anybody to come talk to you mope about like that."<br/>"GAH!" Ranma shouted in frustration. The tavern momentarily turned toward her and then looked away. Ranma continued, quietly angry. "You just ruined another meal!"<br/>"Oh, that guy?" Lina asked she looked around a moment and frowned, there was something about the man that she didn't like. "Sorry about that. I just wanted to cheer you up."<br/>"Why?" Ranma asked. "What's my life to you?" Lina snorted<br/>"You DO realize that you're like one of the most active Bandit Killers right now," Lina said.<br/>"I don't kill anyone," Ranma protested.<br/>"That's not the point," Lina shrugged. "I need an example for my priests and priestesses, and so far this generation your it. I can't have you falling into depression and ruining that, can I? Why are you banging your head on the table?"<p>********<p>The pigeon listened to the discussion at the table. Ranma had allowed Akane to be hurt by some summoned monster. All because the evil creature was to cowardly to stand up to a cat.<br/>"You'll have to postpone the match," Kasumi said.<br/>"I can't," Akane said. "The only choice she'll give me is forfeit, I just know it."<br/>"Well, you'll have to find someone to take your place," Nabiki said.<br/>"And where are we going to find another girl that can represent Ryoko," Akane asked. "Fight in that style, AND look good in an acrobats outfit?" All three stared blankly for a moment.<br/>"Think he'll do it?" Akane asked. "How are we going to convince a guy to wear that outfit?"<br/>"That shouldn't be a problem," Nabiki muttered under her breath.<br/>~Yes!~ Ryouga thought. ~If Ranma loses this match, Akane will never forgive him, and then she'll be safe from his influence!~ He flapped past the three girls, and Akane glanced up at the pigeon irritably.<br/>"Ranma's right," Akane said. "He does show up at the worst times."<br/>"What?" Nabiki asked supiciously.<br/>"Nothing."<p>********<p>"Have a good hunt Ranma?" Nabiki asked as Ranma walked back into the house.<br/>"Lina decided to cheer me up," Ranma muttered.<br/>"Oh?" Nabiki said, arching her eyes. She seemed to consider something and then smiled.<br/>"Ranma," Kasumi said as she came into the room. "How's your back?"<br/>"I'm fine," Ranma said.<br/>"Come over here and let me see," Kasumi said. "I probably won't be able to do anything but I should at least try."<br/>"Maybe later," Ranma said hesitantly. "What about Akane?"<br/>"She probably won't be able to fight tomorrow," Kasumi said quietly. "She'll either have to forfeit or postpone."<br/>"Or find a replacement," Nabiki said as Akane walked into the living room.<br/>"Ranma," Akane said nervously. "Are you okay?" She moved next to him and started to fuss over him a little.<br/>"What's with you?" Ranma asked nervously.<br/>"Your father told us about your accident with those cats," Kasumi said. Ranma growled and shook off Akane.<br/>"Hey, I'm just worried about you," Akane said angrily.<br/>"Did he happen to say how I ended up in a pit of cats?" Ranma asked.<br/>"No, he didn't," Nabiki said. ~Nor how normal cats in any number would be a problem for you.~<br/>"Didn't think so," Ranma grumbled, then changed the subject. "What about the duel tomorrow. Somebody said something about a replacement."<br/>"Well, we haven't talked to..." Akane started.<br/>"Hey guys, what's up?" Ryoko looked around at the group she had just materialized into. She took a moment to look over the memories of the group to save on conversation. "It wasn't Kodachi. Neither of us allow devil or demon summoning. You should have considered asking me to heal you though."<br/>"Oh, well, I sort of thought that would be rude," Akane said.<br/>"You're right," Ryoko said. "But you could of asked."<br/>"So can you..." Akane started after a moment.<br/>"Nope," Ryoko said. "Made a deal with Ayeka, no intervention at all. So no magic. No divine healing. I have no trouble with Ranma fighting though, I'll need to talk to Akane though. Be right back." Ryoko vanished again.<br/>"Wait...me?" Ranma asked trying to catch Ryoko before she disappeared.<br/>"You're the only one with the skills who can represent Ryoko," Akane said.<br/>"But I'm..." He touched his scars briefly. "I haven't trained for this." There was a splash of water and Ranma found herself changed into a woman, she glared up at the culprit and saw Ryouga standing there gripping her cloak.<br/>"I guess this will be an all nighter," Ryouga said smirking triumphantly. Ranma shook out of her cloak and stomped toward the dojo.<br/>"Let's get this over with then," Ranma said. "Before I pound your face in, jerk."<br/>"I should make sure they don't kill each other," Akane said, following them.<br/>"Ayeka ranted a lot, but..." Ryoko glanced around. "Where'd they all go?"<br/>"Practice," Nabiki said.<br/>"Ah, in that case," Ryoko rubbed her hands together. "I guess I can sample the local establishments." She walked out of the door in anticipation of sampling mortal liquor.<p>********<p>"Ranma," Ryouga pointed to the redhead. "You're bleeding."<br/>"I know!" Ranma snapped. "It's nothing. I'll just have to wear read or something dark tomorrow."<br/>"Whatever," Ryouga said smirking. "It's not my problem."<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said, then continued reluctantly. "You don't have to do this you know."<br/>"Of course I do," Ryouga said, smiling.<br/>"You do?" Ranma asked, glancing at Ryouga. First Akane's worried about him and now...<br/>"I have to make sure you lose tomorrow," Ryouga said, making sure no one was in the dojo yet. Ranma's face fell and she stared down at the ground for a little bit.<br/>"I should have known," she muttered. "You JERK!" She charged forward wielding the gymnastics club in her hand. Suddenly, Akane was in the way, and Ranma stopped.<br/>"Finish your fight AFTER tomorrow's match," Akane snapped. "Really, what is the problem with you two!"<br/>"I told you already," Ranma muttered angrily. She returned to a starting position and entered stance sullenly. "Let's get this over with."<br/>"Don't you dare mess this up just to get at he...him," Akane whispered to Ryouga. Then she walked to the edge of the dojo to watch. The celestial sweatdropped nervously. Ranma watched the display and growled quietly, clenching her fists around her club.<p>********<p>"Someone tried to assassinate Lord Ranma and Akane Tendo today," Kodachi gasped as she came out of meditation.<br/>She was not found of Akane at all, but the woman was one of Ryoko's priestesses. Whether she liked it or not, the temples were pledged to protect each other in times of real trouble. And of course any attempt on the life of her demonic love could not be forgiven.<br/>"Well," she said. "After I humilate this replacement of hers tomorrow, I shall have to see about investigating this."<p>********<p>"You didn't accomplish much," the speaker was a 'woman' with pale blonde hair. "I wanted you too watch them, nothing else. If you felt you had to try something, you should have succeeded in killing at least one of them."<br/>"They were more than little too much for Azusa's 'pretty'," the man said. "Maybe more than one, but I think they'll be ready for it now."<br/>"And the redhead?" their mistress asked.<br/>"A half-demon, afraid of cats," the man said, smiling. The blonde turned to look at him and arched an eyebrow.<br/>"You think its that one?" she asked.<br/>"What are you talking about?" Azusa asked. "Azusa want to know about beast that kill her Jean-Pierre."<br/>"I'm suddenly more interested in her friend," the other woman asked. "Do you think you can collect the half-breed, Sanzenin?" The man smiled.<br/>"Their may be difficulty," Sanzenin said. "The creature is desperate for attention, but Little Girl Lina seems to be taking an interest in it."<br/>"Do so. Alive and willing if possible."<p>Back to Martial Artists and Mayhem: Third Edition
