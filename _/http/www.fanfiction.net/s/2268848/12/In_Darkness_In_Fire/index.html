</div><p>"What do you think she's doing out here?" Came an unfamiliar voice. It was a rich baritone sound, masculine.</p><p>"I don't know, but she seems pretty beat up." Another unfamiliar voice, a woman this time. The world was too much a blur for her to do anything.</p><p>"Let's take her to the house. We can see what we can do there." The man suggested, she could feel herself being lifted. The darkness was heavy, and seemed to impose on her vision more and more. Just before losing herself to it, a single thought brought a smile to her lips. <i>I made it.</i></p><p><b>In Darkness In Fire</b></p><p>By: XZero</p><p>Disclaimer: I own nothing</p><p>A/N: See bottom for thanks.</p><p><b>Chapter 11 - Collecting the Crew</b></p><p><i>Minato Ward - Hino Shrine</i></p><p>The meeting was not going well. Several of the girls were crying liberally. They had arrived only a few moments after the fight, only to find their comrade dying, she had whispered a few words to Neptune, but the life had left her in seconds after that final message. Since then there had been no expression on the aqua trussed senshi other than grim determination. They all felt this loss, but no so much as she. The others had lost a friend and teammate. Michiru had lost a lover and partner.</p><p>Usagi's tears stopped suddenly, an expression shooting over her features that shocked the tears away from her subordinates.</p><p>"He must be dealt with." A regal tone, so unlike the whiny blonde that they were all used to. It seemed that she had slipped into the royal persona that they had seen and had saved them all countless times. The steel in her eyes was ill-fitting, they all thought, but her same determination spread from there.</p><p>"Usagi is right, he has slain both Uranus and Mercury. Forgiveness is not an option, he is vengeful, and will not stop until we are all dead." Setsuna, again her voice was smooth, though a sliver of grief had entered her tone, enough that all her comrades were convinced of her sincerity. Almost.</p><p>"I must stress that with Uranus' defeat we have lost a teammate, as well as the wielder of the Space Sword. Neptune, you must not try to avenge her on your own, all that will result is that you will be killed more gruesomely than Haruka, you don't have the martial arts training that she does." The hunter haired senshi kept her voice level, but it was not enough.</p><p>"You this is all your fault, you always have to chase Crystal Tokyo, what about us? Do our lives matter?" Neptune's anguished accusations rang through the shrine. Her cries drowned any further words she may have spoken, the wracking sobs spilling down over her cheeks in a deluge. Bloodshot eyes and red skin glared at the older woman, accusations both verbal and mental exploded at the woman as her tears dried for but a moment.</p><p>Shock struck each of the women, how could Michiru think that of Setsuna, sure, she was goal oriented, but it was for the best wasn't it? She wanted, just as they all did for a world free of strife. Where everyone was equal, where everyone was happy. Hotaru saw it though, Setsuna had always been willing to sacrifice one of them if it would mean certain victory, each of them had died at one point or another, sacrificed for Crystal Tokyo. She missed her parent, but she couldn't let the pain of betrayal by the two go. Combining that with her visions of the past, she couldn't let it go, something was wrong. Tears came again to her, both tears of grief, and of helplessness. She couldn't go against them, but neither could she join with the one who'd killed Haruka.</p><p>"There is nothing else we can do until we can find him. Stay away from patrolling the city, he'll be watching for that." Setsuna stood, and from nowhere drew her Time Key. A wave of the talisman and the hunter trussed woman had gone. They would all imagine that she went to the gates of time. They would be right.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Nerima Ward</i><p>It was this that she hated the most, the entire situation was awful, but this was worse than defeat right now. The Nekohanten was a beacon in the darkness, "Closed" hung on the door, but that didn't stop her, neither for that matter did the late hour. Her knocks echoed through the dining area of the restaurant. A single light went on upstairs, and the sharp clack of resinated wood on wood told her whom to expect to answer. Her aura was like a bonfire hidden in the form of embers. He knew who it was. The door opened and the soaking redhead stared into the ancient eyes that held more than a little wisdom.</p><p>"Elder Cologne?" Her voice cracked using the honorific. She hated to ask for help, especially from the old ghoul, no, the elder. But she realized that en masse, she could never hope to defeat the senshi alone. Uranus had taken more from her than she'd expected, her attacks were varied, and, although supremely lacking in skill, was more than fast and strong enough to make up the difference. A dainty hand rubbed tenderly over bruised ribs, a reminder of the one place her guard had been open.</p><p>"Come child, we have much to discuss." The shrunken woman waved an arm toward the inside, using that momentum to swing herself around and began to pogo into the dining area.</p><p>"Well then Ranma, what brings you here? We've given you ample time to grieve, I can't truly hope you've come to marry Shampoo now can I?" She chuckled lightly in her croaking tone as the redheaded girl went goggle eyed.</p><p>"Oh calm yourself, I know what brings you, I was merely teasing." The small girl relaxed visibly, not in any condition to fight herself free of this place if she was betrayed.</p><p>"I... I need your help." She exhaled heavily, knowing that she must do this wasn't making it any easier.</p><p>"The senshi are too strong, I can't face them all at once. I had some trouble with one of them, but she's... dead." She finished her statement and Cologne almost couldn't conceal her surprise. She was proud of him, his conviction in his pursuit of vengeance was strong. He was already more than strong enough, but he needed desperately to add to his repertoire. His skills were great, but his knowledge of techniques was supremely limited. She had heard of that fight, and the new technique he had displayed to end his fight with Sailor Uranus was powerful, but fighting against several overwhelming opponents is different from the titanic and single combats he was used to. She could help him, but what could she request of him.</p><p>"I will help you son. I will help you. But in return you must do one thing for me, you must swear that at any time we call upon you, you must answer the call of the amazons. You will be an outsider in all but name." She knew what it seemed like, and she could see the ounce of suspicion in his eyes, but it faded, and the storm shrouded eyes set into determination.</p><p>"All right." She began to speak but was swiftly cut off.</p><p>"Ranma, I must ask one last thing. No matter what, you must return to us all alive. You cannot die." She said, with a gentle look in her eyes, like a grandmother gazing at her headstrong grandson. Just like she saw it.</p><p>"I understand Elder." The redhead nodded calmly, eyes shining with glee. She could not resist the urge that came upon her suddenly, without warning Cologne found herself enveloped in a hug, her staff hitting the ground with a number of rattling clacks.</p><p>"Thank you." The girl whispered in her ear, tears welling into the already stormy blue eyes. Cologne could only hang there, suspended in the embrace she was folded in. It was pleasant, but a deep yawn reminded both women that it was well past time for both of them to be asleep.</p><p>"You may stay in the spare room. Mousse has been gone for a couple of weeks and won't need it anyway. He has been gone with the current events. You are somewhat the legend among the Joketsuzoku. Saffron was an opponent all feared, you are the first to defeat him." She explained, failing in her efforts to stave off another yawn.</p><p>"Get some sleep, we will begin tomorrow." She said, disappearing up the stairs.</p><p>"I can do this, I just need some help." She'd call on some of his erstwhile friends tomorrow as well. He needed the strength of the wrecking crew, no matter what the price, the senshi would pay.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>The Next Day - Tendo Dojo</i><p>Ryouga had finally returned to the dojo, and was glad for it. He had finally returned home after so much time. Unfortunately the world seemed set against him, it would only be minutes before he was taken to the Nekohanten, something about Cologne and training.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Kumon Residence - Kyoto</i><p>"Okay, okay, I understand, I'll be there." Ryuu was pissed, she hadn't been the greatest, but when Nodoka was under the impression that he was her son, she had been so kind to him. Ranma and he had not parted on the best of terms, but he had practically begged him for his help.</p><p>"I'll be leaving for awhile." He spoke to the air as he gathered his things. He was a decent ways down the road when a woman's voice came from within his dojo house.</p><p>"Ryuu!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Near Sapporo</i><p>"Do you think she'll be okay?" The woman from before asked, concerned for the blue haired girl lying in torn pants and a shredded shirt.</p><p>"She's just sleeping, she'll be just fine." A groan turned their attention toward the cot on which the blue haired senshi lie.</p><p>"There's your answer, she's waking up."</p><p>To Be Continued...</p><p>A/N: A good author knows when his critics are correct, and as such, this chapter is another bit of filler, thenext chapter willskip forward past the readying, because I feel you've all been patient in waiting for the action.I do apologize that this chapter is so short by the way.</p>
