</div><p>Awhile  later Ranma was headed to his mother's home, his step carrying no  little amount of jubilation in it. He walked casually, and would  reach his mother's home quickly at this pace, within the next few  moments in fact. That was when he felt the spike of energy. His  mother was a blazing beacon at full strength, and this beacon shined  with killing intent staining the serenity that was usually the feel  of her aura. Her energy was waning though, and it wouldn't take  much longer for her to fall entirely. His pack forgotten he dashed  toward her home, his mind frantic about what could cause this.</p><p><b>In  Darkness In Fire</b></p><p>By:  X-Zero</p><p>Disclaimer:  I own nothing</p><p><b>Chapter  5 - The Ascending Storm</b></p><p>Everything  was a blur, at one moment, she had been standing in the center of her  dojo, having just finished warming her muscles to prepare for  training when the feeling of foreboding suddenly went quiet, followed  by the roof caving in. At first she wondered who had just crossed  into her home and attacked, thinking it was one of her son's  adversaries, then things had steadily gotten worse, in the span of  seconds she was surrounded by figures right out of some ridiculous  sentai manga. It was only the immense power that they were giving off  that warned her of the real danger. A green haired staff-wielding  woman stepped forward, forestalling the ready made speech that the  apparent leader was going to make.</p><p>"You  are a threat to the future; your kind must be eliminated."  Without further warning she leveled her staff at the auburn haired  swordswoman, grinning maliciously as the energy coalesced around the  head of the key-shaped silver staff. It was utterly silent, and  according to her senses, did not exist, the words she whispered as  the energy shot toward her were lost as a horrible sound that no  mortal creature could convey echoed forth from the attack. A sense of  agony carried within the dark orb, though its name was muffled by her  comrades announcing their attacks. Weapons of the various elemental  energies all stream toward her, dodged by narrow margins and taxing  her stamina steadily as she was forced by their very nature to evade  rather than block or parry.</p><p>"Dou  Ryu Sen!" she whispered as she channeled her ki through her  blade and struck the wooden floor of the dojo in a circling cut, the  floor around her exploding outward, forcing her opponents to leap  quickly into the air to avoid the wooden shrapnel. That was the  instant of reprieve that she needed, switching stances quickly and  charged toward the staff-wielder. Several testing strokes of her  blade later she was on the defensive again, striking out and dodging  the hailstorm of blows from the senshi of Jupiter. Narrow slices in  the bodysuit of the sailor soldier's uniform caused Makoto to slow,  and in an instant, her defenses were overwhelmed, causing her to miss  seeing the strike that made all go dark. A pommel punch to the base  of the skull caused the senshi of lightning to sink unceremoniously  to the ground, unconscious. It was far from over then, however, as  the senshi of air chose to take up the challenge, this woman was very  good with her sword, but never could she match the soldier of Uranus.</p><p>The  Space Sword appeared in her hand as she made the motion of the draw  and rushed toward her adversary, striking with a low-high right  diagonal, only to find her impressive speed lacking. Nodoka halted  Uranus' blade with the side of her own, smiling condescendingly as  they locked gazes for an instant. They leapt back and clashed again,  brilliant sparks flying up between the two blades. Uranus was fast,  and strong, but her strikes lacked the grace that the auburn haired  woman's motions did, and it did not take an expert to tell she would  lose if these exchanges continued. Both women leapt back again,  though the leaps produced different effects, Uranus slammed a fist  into the floor, bellowing out her war cry.</p><p>"World  Shaking!" Her shout caused a gold and titian sphere to pass  violently along the dojo's floor, leaping up toward Nodoka swiftly,  even as the other woman made her own attack.</p><p>"Kurenai  Tama!" The crimson orb shot from her hand and struggled against  the attack of the sailor soldier, though it was only moments until  the auburn-haired woman's technique punched through that of the  senshi of air. It was too late by the time Uranus realized that her  attack would not succeed, and even as the crimson shot rocketed  toward her, albeit largely diminished by the strength required to  surpass the World Shaking. She stood her ground and grit her teeth as  the orb struck her, nothing she could do would keep it from hitting  its mark. The bullet of ki struck her in the chest, and felt as no  more than a very strong punch to the chest, stunning for a second but  nothing more. That was when Nodoka flowed toward her again, striking  out in a complex pattern that Uranus could only frantically block and  parry, looking desperately for a way to counter. Her defense wasn't  so nearly as solid as she hoped, and tiny cuts in her arms began to  reflect this. It was all she could do to lock blades with the woman,  each grasping the other's sword arm to prevent further attacks. For  the sandy blond senshi, this was a great reprieve, and her teammates  saw her need of assistance.</p><p>"Flame  Sniper!" The raven-haired soldier screamed as she loosed the  pinpoint flame arrow. Her position was beneficial, as it was flanking  the swordswoman, and would be a sure hit. Her congratulations were  cut short when the Saotome woman pushed away from the other senshi,  leaving the dust blonde soldier of air off-balance and unprepared for  the plasma arrow as it cut through the air toward her. Not enough  time to move, thought Uranus desperately as she tried to brace  herself for the fiery projectile. She winced as she expected the  arrow to pierce her flesh, but smiled in relief when she saw the  flames wash against a barrier of seemingly nothing. It was only  moments later that another silent movement of energy was released,  slamming into the auburn swordswoman. Hotaru had covered her, but why  had she not attacked, this would have been over by now had she done  anything other than the Silent Wall to protect her adopted parent.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sailor  Pluto was exultant, relishing this moment as she prepared her attack.  <i>Finally, she is the last, once she is gone, the future will be  safe and secure.</i> She didn't count on Nodoka rising to her feet,  even if she did so unsteadily. The temporal mage's attack had hit  home on unprotected flesh, and the immense pain from it had drained a  great deal of her energy. The Saotome matriarch took a stance and  prepared herself, all the stops were released now. She charged the  first she saw, and watched as the others swarmed to defend her. This  was her chance, a deft sidestep of the orange trimmed senshi's chain  attack she did the quick spin, momentum increasing as she brought the  slash at the end. "Ryu Kan Sen!" Venus was down, her  stomach opened and barely kept from dying by the strong protective  magic her sailor soldier armor granted her.<p>It  was not enough though, that the auburn haired swordswoman had downed  one of their allies with a vicious attack like she did, more to the  point was that suddenly, everything was covered in a thick layer of  frost as Mercury released her defensive spell. Everyone took a moment  to catch their breath as the mist floated about in the remains of the  dojo. Heavy breaths could not even fog in the heavy mist that covered  the dojo, maintained even in the heat of the noon day sun.</p><p>Nodoka  started audibly, and realized her mistake as the green haired woman's  staff, and their leader's strange weapon began charging, not that she  could see either, but sensing one she thought it was the only one.  Her mistake was not because she was surprised; rather it was because  she felt Ranma approaching fast. He would be here soon, and she  needed to either finish this, or hold out long enough for him to  help. "Dead Scream." "Moon Gorgeous Meditation!"  Hundreds of tiny energy signatures sprouted in her senses, there was  no way to dodge them all, but block them, yes that would do.</p><p>"Ikusen  Dageki Satsu!" Her sword flashed in a whirlwind of silver blurs,  smacking the solid light shards away, and noting their dissipation  after the fact. Her senses received a shock when she heard that same  horrible sound. It was only made worse when she heard her son scream  as her concentration was lost and the last of the light shards struck  her, followed closely by the dark orb. In that last instant, she was  at peace.</p><p>Ranma  had arrived, begging the kami for more speed, channeling his energies  internally he pushed his body to its limits, but on his arrival, he  could only see that it wasn't enough. He had arrived and been stuck  in place, could only watch as his mother lost her concentration and  was consumed by the joint power of the senshi. His mind shattered,  and for the first time, he could do absolutely nothing, paralyzed. To  his credit, he staggered toward his mother's limp form. Upon reaching  her he dropped to his knees, tears welling up in his eyes as his  world broke. His mother was gone, and he could do nothing to save  her. That was when he felt it, felt that block that his mother spoke  of, felt it degrade and shatter, his power was incredible, but  nothing would bring his mother back into his life. Nothing could give  him back the parent that he had so recently regained. He didn't seem  to see the senshi around her, all poised to attack. Nor, upon  reflection, would he care, they weren't important right now, holding  his mother was, being with her now, as he heart stopped completely,  as the last of her spirit faded forever from this world. That was  important.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Flash</i><p>He  was just a child, and he could remember his mother tending the scrape  he had gotten playing.</p><p><i>Flash</i></p><p>A  day spent finger painting with her, smiling and happy.</p><p><i>Flash</i></p><p>It  was time to leave, his father and he stopped at the door, and he had  given her a hug,</p><p><i>Flash</i></p><p>For  the first time in years, he had a mother, and she was proud of him</p><p><i>Flash</i></p><p><i>Flash</i></p><p>"MOTHER!"  He screamed to the heavens, cursing everything. He was hurting, and  nothing would stop his revenge.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Flash</i><p>With  that the raven haired youth rose to his feet, tears dripping from his  chin, head tilted to the Earth casting a shadow over his features.  Each of the sailor soldiers could only stand in shock and fear  though, this young seeming man was the son of this woman. They had  killed someone's mother? Setsuna hadn't told them that this woman  lived a normal life, was a normal woman. They had assumed her power  was no different from the other incredible powers they had faced,  alien and unnatural. Ranma's eyes suddenly went alight with the fires  of his very soul, his power coalescing into a large and still  swelling orb of putrid green. In his arms he clutched his mother's  body, hugging the woman who gave him life.</p><p>"You  people, why?" He asked, and in a calm whisper that was betrayed  by his obvious pain he mouthed, "Shin Shi Shi Hokodan." The  volume did nothing to change the immensity of the attack, and the  sailors scrambled to get clear of the looming and wobbling bomb of  power as it fell to earth, releasing enough to crater the ground all  around them. In his depression Ranma was unaffected by the attack,  just as it was designed to, the sailor soldiers were not so  fortunate; their ranks were caught in the blast area and could only  struggle to hold their ground. They had only approached in their  normal sailor transformations, unaware that they might need the power  of the super sailors. He was on another level entirely, and could  only be described as a titan of power. Pluto, Saturn, and Cosmic  Sailor moon held their ground, though only barely.</p><p>"Why  did you do it?" He screamed as sadness transformed into rage.  Around him bloomed a scarlet aura of immense power, radiating sadness  and pain, but most of all, they felt the intense heat of the glow.  The senshi were afraid now, because as powerful as the last had been,  his strength was growing, and they could see painted across his  features was sadness that had been twisted by the scar of watching  his mother die. The pain-filled and menacing aura that had sprung up  around him was there still as he sunk to his knees, caught in a  helpless rage that sent tendrils of energy lashing about the ruined  dojo, tearing cleanly through walls, destroying the building around  them. It was a pitiful sight, and more than one of the senshi felt  tears come to them unbeckoned.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Makoto  cried unabashed, she knew his pain, her parents having died long ago,  and she still felt the pain of their passing. She had raged before,  and lashed out at those around her because she felt that her parents  had been stolen from her, but never did she realize just how wrong  she was, she didn't have to see them die, she didn't have to know  that there was someone who killed them, robbed them from her. This  was too much to bear, watching the young man cry over the motionless  form of his mother.<p>Grouping  together, they could only retreat, perhaps if they retreated, they  would be able to get some answers. Saturn was the only one to not  move, she was frozen in place, crying for what they had done. She  knew that she had done nothing to help the other soldiers, but she  could not help but remember the pleading faces of the people from the  last Saturn's final hours. She could only allow herself to be  surrounded by her friends who helped the wounded amongst their number  join the circle and let their transport carry them to safety. "Why?"  She whispered to herself, "Why?" No one answered her  question, no one heard her speak, but it could be surmised that even  if they had, none of the inner senshi could answer, they were all  still reeling from the scene.</p><p>It  was not until late that night, after no answers had been forthcoming;  after a dream that woke her in a cold sweat, along with all the other  inner senshi, did Usagi realize what had been done. Only then did she  realize that she had murdered that boy's mother, taken him from her  without provocation. It was in the name of the future, and of the  safety of earth, right? She came to understand that they had only  seen a tiny bit of what would inevitably come from this. That boy's  power was immense, enough to rival even her own when she was at her  peak, enough to level the entire planet. What sort of enemy had they  made that day? Would he come for revenge? She shuddered as she lifted  her body to wash her face clean of the sweat on her brow, feeling the  clammy slimy skin of her forehead. The warm water helped her feel  better, but when she looked up from the sink, and into her own eyes  reflected in the mirror, she saw the haunting fear that she felt. She  spoke then words that were repeated many times that night, by several  other teenage girls. "Dear god, what have we done."</p><p>To  Be Continued...</p><p>A/N:  I know that this one is kind of short, but I will admit that this was  the best I could manage without causing the effect to seem overdone  and drawn out. I hope that this is a satisfactory chapter. The second  act will begin as soon as I can get it written. For now, leave  reviews, I'm begging you. Also, I would like to note that I was only  able to do this better than a meager 1500 word chapter was because of  the song that Oneshot linked to on his update for today. I don't  know who composed the song, but I agree with Oneshot, the song is  built for powerful messages, and while I can only scratch at the  depth he manages, I hope this has done something for at least one of  those who read this. Without further ado, the technique translations.</p><p><b>Technique  Translations:</b></p><p><b>Ikusen  Dageki Satsu:</b> Thousand Strike Kill</p><p><b>Kurenai Tama:</b> Crimson Bullet</p><p><b>Dou  Ryu Sen: </b>Most might recognize the name. It is a technique  originating in Rurouni Kenshin, and as you might guess, it is  Nodoka's grandfather's school of martial arts. I have searched  for a translation, and have found only this one, if I am wrong,  please inform me. No, Rurouni Kenshin will not play a major part in  this, especially because I feel it a bastardization of Samurai X.  Anyhow, the name means Ground Dragon Flash.</p><p><b>Ryu  Kan Sen:</b> I am led to believe that this means Dragon Wrap Sword.</p>
