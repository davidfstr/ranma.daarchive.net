</div><p><i>I write this now to clear my conscience. Hopefully, whoever you are, you are not a member of the conspiracy the senshi of time and the silver queen have been orchestrating. It is my duty, as a defender of the empire to know the goings on, and throughout the years, dissent has been growing among the lower classes. Commoners are becoming poorer, while the nobility of Luna is growing fat and decadent. I have done my best to fix things, but at every turn I am halted.</i></p><p><i>In the last year refugees from another system have been escaping to our worlds. The Dark Knights last system was destroyed in a conflict, and so they came here, and have been steadily making the planet Vulcan habitable. They are an amazing people, though Pluto seems to be urging the queen to use them as an enemy, to unite the peoples against them. They are to be the scapegoat through which she reclaims her popularity among the masses. May the Gods help us, for we are sure to pay for this.</i></p><p><i>Princess Mercury<br/>Senshi of Ice<br/>Aria Frost</i></p><p><b>In Darkness In Fire</b></p><p>By: XZero</p><p>Disclaimer: I own nothing.</p><p><b>Chapter 8 - World Changing</b></p><p><i>Hino Shrine</i></p><p>The senshi arrived one by one into the safe confines of the Hino Shrine, another meeting discussing their situation, they seemed to do that a lot recently, talking. Mars hated that, they decided that they'd fight, they had no other choice it seemed, Setsuna was sure from her examinations of the possible futures that the Dark Knight would continue his campaign against them until his bloodlust was sated.</p><p>"Where is Ami?" One spoke, they'd never be sure which of them spoke, especially when the answer would shock them all to the core.</p><p>"I have bad news." Setsuna's voice came suddenly from behind their meatball headed leader, startling the girl. Usagi dropped her soda into her lap, spilling the fizzing liquid over her skirt, as well as the manga that lay there.</p><p>"Don't do that!" She exclaimed, but sobered when the part about bad news finally registered.</p><p>"Wait, bad news?" She asked hesitantly, it was unlike Ami to be late. The senshi of mercury was if anything punctual. The gathered senshi sat dead still afraid of the answer.</p><p>"Mercury was on her way here, the Dark Knight attacked her. I'm afraid that she is dead." No emotion touched her voice, none that could possibly be discerned by the dumbstruck soldiers. The pretty soldiers were on the brink of tears; Usagi though, usually the one to be reduced to a tearing mess first, was strangely silent. Tears threatened to burst from her eyes, but resolution instead seeped from the cerulean orbs.</p><p>"Peace is not an option. I ask you princess, for Ami's sake..." Pluto had hit the all the right buttons, everything would happen as she expected, as the future depended. The shrine stopped simply being a meeting place at that moment; now, it was a war room.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Tendo Dojo</i><p>A musk enveloped her senses, making her head float and swim through the thick air. It was warm, moist; human sweat, no doubt. Kasumi could see someone lying prone some ways into the darkened room. The night air behind her was cool, but from the remaining thickness in the room, she could tell that he'd just finished workout. It was just like him to work himself past exhaustion. A soft sigh escaped her lips.</p><p>"Oh Ranma-kun." She strode quietly toward the young man, a subtle shake of her head almost imperceptible. She disapproved of his recklessness, but she couldn't honestly fault him. His mother had been stolen from him, cruelly taken. She herself could remember vividly the day of her mother's death. Cancer seemed to appear from nowhere, and all too soon she had been taken to the hospital. Tests, visits, tears, they all blurred together for the brunette.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to clear the thoughts, stave off the memories. She didn't want them. As much as she loved her mother, she couldn't bear to remember her like that. Memories of her childhood, days when she would help her mother with chores, help her cook. She preferred those memories, memories of happier times, when the most important thing was her mother's smiling face.</p><p>Her revery seemed to shock her, and the tears that had threatened to spill began to do so. She sank unsteadily to her knees, the pain of the bad taking place in her mind over the good.</p><p>"Kasumi-chan?" She could hear Ranma's tired voice in the background, beyond her pain. She reached out; he was inches from her, speaking softly though she couldn't understand him at the time. It was all she could do to clutch onto him, clinging to his shirt, sobbing madly. She could not remember how long she was there, or when she stood next, but she was glad, glad that they had not taken Ranma as well.</p><p>"It'll all be okay Kasumi, it'll all be okay." He whispered weakly, though his voice was gaining strength as he realized the need.</p><p>The first rays of morning's light woke the chestnut haired girl, awoke her to a sight that brought a smile to her weary features.</p><p>"Ranma-kun." She said barely stifling a yawn. "Oh my, breakfast." She started. Standing quickly, she straightened the wrinkles in her skirt.</p><p>"Kasumi, I'll take care of it, you take a bath and get changed." The eldest of the Tendo sisters nodded, albeit, reluctantly, moving into the house and toward her room.</p><p>With that taken care of Ranma went toward the kitchen to make breakfast, that night had earned him his latest technique, the succession technique, Harumagedon. The entry was vague, and he had exhausted his energy supply in using it, but he had it, and could remember well the feeling of raw power he'd been filled with.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Flashback</i><p>The dark of night had come, the moon was new, and darkness loomed over the streets of Nerima. That is not where we watch, however; within the Tendo compound a young man repeats the same motion over and over again. Thoughts racing, examining and re-examining a single passage.</p><p><i>Your strength is not enough, nor will it ever be. A force of nature presents itself to you, grasp it, take hold of the flames and seek justice. Call those who have trespassed against us before judgment. Release Armageddon.</i></p><p>He understood, he'd learned throughout his study of this style that it was reliant on natural energy. Though he'd never tried the natural thermal energies that surrounded him. Fire was hardest to grasp, hardest to hold, and even more difficult still to control. Straining himself, he pulled at the elemental energy; using his own ki to form it, control it, but never did he try to confine the flames. The energy buildup was fast, as fire fled to its like, pulling in more and more energy exponentially.</p><p>Ranma wondered what it was that he was supposed to do with the power that he held; wondered what it was that it was meant for. It was when he felt the power becoming more and more violent that he understood, release it, unfocused and unfettered.</p><p><i>Call those who have trespassed against us before judgment. Release Armageddon.</i></p><p>"Harumagedon!" His almost exultant cry pierced the night, shaking birds of prey from their perches in frustration as their prey fled from the noise. Dogs barked, and then were silent. The entire world seemed to still, all but one man. Ranma's body ignited, going up in a blaze of flame. Though he remained untouched as his body sprang forward at the dummy.</p><p><i>So this is Armageddon.</i> The pigtailed man reflected as he felt himself moving throw hundreds of killing blows in seconds, watched almost from outside himself as each strike left a distinctive scorch on the reinforced training tool. He felt the energy fleeing him, felt his body begin to shut down. He had been tired before, but from the sudden extreme soreness spreading throughout his body, he could feel the strain that this put on him. Into darkness, into fire, thus his mind went blank.</p><p><i>End Flashback</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>There was some more fine-tuning to be done, things that had to be learned in order to control the power of the technique, but revenge would be sweet; "After all." Ranma reflected as the food finished cooking. "Revenge is a dish best served cold."<hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Somewhere</i><p>The darkness lifted from the world around her, and now she could see. She was lying on a cot rough canvas scratching her skin. But as she continued to scan her surroundings nothing made sense, around her was a shifting void, incongruous with the Earth that she knew.</p><p>"I am sorry Mercury, but you've learned too much, things must go as planned." Came a familiar voice, immediately recognizable to the bluette. <i>Setsuna?</i> Ami's eyes bugged as she took in the scene around her.</p><p>"What are you?" That was when the girl noticed Pluto's stance, holding the time key as she was. The garnet orb was leveled at her, and the energies of a Dead Scream were gathering as silently as ever around the jewel. Ami knew that escape was impossible, but perhaps she could do something. Her mind was racing for the answer, if only she could find it.</p><p>"So, it really was a conspiracy." She stated, seemingly unconcerned about the apparent betrayal by her fellow senshi. She had a plan, and hopefully she could execute it soon.</p><p>"It makes no difference, the Dark Knights must be eliminated, they are threats to the common good." She said resettling her stance a bit, shifting to adjust to the weight of her weapon. Still the dark energies swirled around her stave.</p><p>"Why?" The haired teen asked desperately, hoping to understand the why of things, as well as waiting for a moment to transform, she could fight the senshi of Pluto, but not until she was able to transform.</p><p>Setsuna was unconcerned with time, knowing that as she stood here, holding the senshi of Mercury prisoner, that the were formulating a battle plan. They were readying themselves for the coming conflict, sure of the vengeance that they sought. Everything was going to plan, she had plenty of time to finish her off.</p><p>"If you must know, it is because they are too powerful, they are a threat to us and everything around them. They had enemies Mercury, do you understand what could mean for us? Not even the queen realized the threat that their enemies posed. If left to their own devices, they would have been our downfall. For the future, both then and now, they must die." She said, fanatical faith painting hysteria through her voice.</p><p>"Murderer." Ami spat, choosing now to take her chance. She threw her thin blanket at Pluto creating a curtain between them. As quickly as she could she flung herself to the side, hoping that she was right in assuming the green haired woman would fire her shot when the distraction came at her. The horrifying wail behind her confirms it.</p><p>"Mercury Crystal Power, make up!" She shouted, the transformation going only for an instant before she emerged from it as Super Sailor Mercury. She dashed away from Pluto hoping to gain some distance to recover and formulate a battle strategy.</p><p>"Dead Scream!" The name of her spell preceded the banshee's wail. She could not believe the cunning of the girl, distracting her with such obvious technique. Now she would either have to abandon the girl here, or risk compromising her plan. She would be late if she delayed any further.</p><p>"Damn!" She growled in frustration as she twirled the staff, opening the gates of time long enough for her to slip through.
