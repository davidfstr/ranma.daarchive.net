</div><p>Outside  of all that exists, in a place where nothing existed, yet existed  everywhere at once, a tall dark woman with green hair streaming down  her back stood holding an apparently ivory staff, this staff was in  the shape of a key, a heart filled with a garnet orb at the top. She  stared into a hole in the nothingness, a gap within the every  shifting chaos of time. This gap was surrounded by ornate doors  depicting angels and demons, this was what was known as the gates of  time. The image within the open gates was that of a woman, auburn  hair cut short with a small jade clip behind her left ear. She stared  directly ahead with gray eyes that glinted like naked steel in the  light. "How?" The woman howled, "I thought they were  all gone, sure, there was one like them at the tail end of the  Tokugawa, but I got rid of him, got rid of his entire family." A  tear fell from the corner of an eye. Even the children, she knew they  had done nothing, but their existence was a threat to the Earth, just  as it had been to the Silver Empire. "I have to be rid of this  woman, before she can ascend." She turned, and her deep eyes  drilled into the woman's image, burning it into her mind. "The  threat must be eliminated." She declared solemnly, fading from  sight.</p><p><b>In  Darkness In Fire</b></p><p>BY:XZero</p><p>Disclaimer:  I own nothing...</p><p><b>Chapter  3 - Brewing Storm</b></p><p>Tsukino  Usagi awoke in a cold sweat that morning, dreams of fires engulfing  the pristine and ornate structures of white stone that composed the  capital of the Moon Kingdom, the place she could not remember, but  fought for. She realized that she didn't remember much about this  kingdom she fought for, but she desperately wanted to make a  difference, and knew that the old enemies of her people would not  rest until they had destroyed or conquered the world. That part of  her life was done, with Galaxia laid to rest no others remained, at  least, that was what Setsuna told them. Despite the shifty and  unreliability of her presence at their meetings, the senshi of Pluto  had proven reliable, if only in dire straits. The hunter tressed  school counselor, who moonlighted as a scantily clad expositionist  soldier of love and justice, had given them clearance to relax,  youma's had become somewhat of a rarity in the peaceful weeks  following Galaxia's demise. Usagi went shivering into her bathroom, a  western style restroom meant to accomodate her and minimize spacial  requirements of the house. These smaller things weren't as  comfortable as the spring-style bath's that most people grew  accustomed to, but her family never had been very traditional, having  adopted the western style long ago. The water drew quickly into the  comparatively small tub, and she undressed quickly and sank to her  eyeballs in the blissfully hot water. "Man, what was that  about?" She whispered softly to herself, wondering when her  pregnant advisor would be home. Luna had been returning less and less  in the past months, she seemed to enjoy remaining with her kitten and  Artemis at Minako's home, and as much as she wished she could, the  oft-time meatball head could not find it in herself to hold a grudge  for it. She closed her eyes and rested in the water, rinsing the film  of sweat from herself as she tried to relax. Today was a sunny  Saturday, and there was no school today, pending the reconstruction  of the gymnasium at her school. The official story had been that it  was a gas leak, as most schools in the district were prone to report.  There was no way any respectable citizen of the "real world"  would ever acknowledge the existence of the sailor senshi publicly,  or recognize the strings of public youma attacks. She sighed deeply,  she had tried to relax, but her life was turning closer to that of  politics, she was supposed to be a queen one day, and despite  apparent lack of maturity, she was trying to be prepared for the  endless bureaucracy she faced. She would be prepared, but first, it  was time for breakfast.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Saotome  Ranma also awoke in a dread that morning, unremembered dreams  haunting him still into the waking world. He shed his blanket and  rose quickly, albeit unsteadily, his muscles ached from the past few  days spent at his mother's home, the home in which he was raised from  infancy. This room wasn't his though, all of those things were  destroyed in the destruction of the original Saotome home. He  cherished this space though, it was the first thing that was truly  his own, the last thing that was his alone and none else's. His bare  feet made padded thuds as he walked toward the bath, his supplies  tucked under one arm. He knew that his mother was awake and waiting  for him at the breakfast table, the wonderful smells and steady ki  signature in the dining room was proof of that. The new skills he had  gained since his arrival had been extremely useful, and he would be  the first to admit, that some of the action animes contained some  good ideas. He couldn't use most of them, but he could indeed adapt  quite a few. Dragonball Z's concept of the spirit bomb was a genius  use of environmental energy. The Spirit Detective's techniques were  great, however, and had set him to thinking about how to adapt these  things to his own usage. He had only seen that one show, but the  concept of spirit energy was fundamentally the same as ki.<p>He  flinched as the cold water struck him, causing his body to... shift,  all this time and countless changes, the best way to describe it  would be shifting, it was like he could feel his body changing. The  hardened and well cut muscles in his torso expanded, becoming softer,  albeit still quite firm breasts. All the other parts of himself  seemed to collapse in on themselves, shrinking as it were. The most  disturbing part of it all was the part of a man that most considered  the manhood, it was as if it just disappeared, falling inward to  become something else entirely. On more than one occasion he had  walked into the restroom to relieve himself and almost forgot to sit  down, standing having been a reflex that had been part of his life in  the wild for years. Suddenly though, Jusenkyo happened, and he  learned things no man should learn. His knowledge of the female  anatomy was more intimate than any man could ever dream. He knew  everything about it, because it was part of his training to know his  body. Scrubbing himself clean took moments, but as always, those  moments seemed to drag into eternity, the rough surface of the sponge  drug across her body. He would never admit it, by certain parts of  him always reacted no matter what he did when he bathed. He finished  and nearly dove into the furo, eager to regain his gender. "Much  better." He smiled and chose to soak for a moment, indulging  himself in the heat. His deliberation, whether or not to remain in  the furo much longer than he had, ended when his stomach grumbled in  rage, protesting the amount of time he had spent not feeding it. That  decision made he hurriedly dried, dressed and groomed himself,  pulling his hair out of a pigtail for once to allow it to dry faster.</p><p>Nodoka  had risen in the early morning, as false dawn began. A quick bath and  she was dressed and beginning her chores for the morning, she could  feel from his ki that Ranma was still sleeping, and would be for  quite some time. Awaking early to watch the sunrise was a habit she  had started years ago, allowing herself to remember that if she had  one connection left to her son, it was the heavens, no matter where  he was, they still shared the sky. So to this day she watched the  stars, and took that time to prepare herself for the day, drawing in  her strength and continuing, which for a long time was all she could  do. Depression threatened her world more than once, and she had  almost fallen into it several times throughout the years, but always  she remembered the sky, and brought herself back from the despair  that her lonely lifestyle created. The sun peeked over the horizon  and the pre-dawn phantoms were banished, long shadows hanging on to  life in the growing light dispelled by the awesome celestial torch.  Taking a moment more to appreciate the sky, Nodoka went about  preparing breakfast for herself and Ranma. She anticipated an intense  hunger, and went about making a large meal, one which she was sure  would readily be devoured mercilessly. She was not to be  disappointed, she felt her son awake and go through his morning  ritual, the one that he seemed to develop while he was here. Few  words passed between them, aside from their time spent conversing  over breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or the time she instructed him, but  other than that, they moved in silent harmony.</p><p>"Good  morning mom." The raven haired young man said, yawning and  stretching himself like a cat, back arched and every bit of him  extended for several seconds. "Good morning son. Breakfast is  still warm, so eat up." She smiled to him, and began her meal,  just as Ranma started his uncanny impression of a Hoover.</p><p>Their  meal was spent talking about things that were mostly inane, Ranma  relating his traveling experiences, while Nodoka listened. Then, in  turn, she would relate to him stories of things that she had done  during his absence. It was a poor replacement, but they wanted the  closeness that was lacking. Even now, they weren't as close as a  mother and son should be, and their rituals had started to build a  bond between them other than that of instructor and pupil. The meal  ended, and they carried the flatware into the kitchen, where they  deposited it in the sink. "The dishes are yours to do this  evening Ranma. Do not tire yourself too completely to do them, like  you have done several times in the last few weeks." The auburn  haired mother admonished, a smile crossing her features.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Mizuni  Ami walked calmly toward the Hino Shrine, schoolbooks tucked under  her arm, and a gentle smile on her face. Ami was known to be a  bookworm, and as such, she tended to spend the majority of her time  reading, but the less known side of her was the one that enjoyed  nature. It seemed odd for someone like her, but there was nothing in  life more enjoyable than resting in the shade of the Sakura trees,  reading while the wind played with her hair. That was how she had  been when she realized that the senshi meeting was today, and that  she should be right on time if not a few minutes early if she left  and traveled on foot. It was this that brought her to her current  location, standing at the foot of the stairwell that led to the  shrine proper. She exhaled audibly and proceeded up the steps,  adjusting the books in her arms to make it easier to lean forward  against the shallow steps. Arriving at the temple she was surprised  to see Yuuichiro not working, but rather standing with Rei, talking,  and from the seem of it, they were doing so companionably.<p>Ami's  light footsteps took her closer to the pair, but all too quickly, Rei  spun around and faced her, surprise written clearly across her face.  "Ami! You're here early." She seemed to freeze, trying to  find her way through the situation at hand, her eyes were wide and  panic stricken. Ami laid her friend's fears to rest, a gentle smile  and a finger touched to her lips and pulled across. Rei's eyes  widened further for a moment, and then returned to normal. She had  gotten Ami's message, and Ami merely cantered into the house, leaving  alone the temple's inhabitants.</p><p>Hino  Rei, a modern everyday rich girl, priestess, devil hunter, was  spending time with her closet boyfriend, someone who had been there  as he could while she was going through her hardest times. Yuuichiro  had been there when it all ended, waiting patiently for her, and when  a crush betrayed her, it was he who held her while she cried, held  her despite her protests. Even while she beat on his chest, punching  at him with all her diminished strength, he held her, solid and  unflinching. At the end of it, she was falling asleep, but she would  never forget what she heard when her tears stopped, "I'll be  here for you..." He hadn't asked anything of her, he just wanted  her to be happy, a change from the few boys she had dated, all of  whom were interested in the innards of her skirt rather than her. A  stream of tears rolled down her cheek at the thought, and when the  calloused hand wiped away the moisture, she smiled. "Me and the  girls are going to do our homework, could you make sure no one  bothers us?" All the older man did was nod, and she knew in her  heart that he would do so.</p><p>She  walked into the room where they met, in her part of the house, near  her room. Ami sat reading from a college level Chemistry text, Rei  passed her friend with a grateful nod and smile, into the bathroom to  wash her face, to erase the tear tracks from her otherwise  unblemished skin. She took a moment to look at herself in the mirror,  marveling at the lack of marks, battles had injured her all over, but  when it was all over, and the fuku was gone, replaced by her normal  civilian clothing, nothing remained, she would feel tired, but never  would an injury leave a scar. Not since she had first donned the  unorthodox armor.</p><p>Aino  Minako and Kino Makoto had once again proven their inability to  procure male companionship for even a single evening, quite simply,  the two girls couldn't get a date, no matter how hard they tried.  This morning found them walking together up the stairs of the Hino  shrine, intent to join their other comapnions within the holy grounds  for their meeting. It had become more of a formality, an excuse to  get together and hang out. They went inside to find everyone else  already there, Usagi snacking on some candy or another, while all the  others chatted amiably. The only one not present was Setsuna and the  single man allowed to know their business, Usagi's boyfriend.  Neither one's absence was surprising, however, as all had become  used to not seeing either. The first came and went as she pleased,  while the second was off studying overseas.</p><p>"So  what's new you guys?" The sometimes senshi of Jupiter asked  cheerily. Everyone at once started, "Well, I had this weird dream  last night." That caused a shared confused glance, before Rei began  in the growing silence. "It was the Moon Kingdom, burning.  Everywhere there were people fighting."</p><p>Usagi  continued, added to the creep factor. "There were people lying dead  in the streets, and I had the feeling that we were fighting." Ami  chimed in now, her soft voice haunted as she recalled the unusual  dream.</p><p>"It  was Armageddon, everything destroyed or burning, ashes from the sky  carried by the wind." Mokoto started where she left off. "A giant  storm enveloped everything, it was like God was angry at the moon or  something." The senshi of Venus finished it all. "It was the  end." Each whimpered lightly when the tingle shot down their  spines, each reliving that moment. They gazed at the Outer senshi  though, none of which looked like they had shared in this dream, as  they appeared shocked. Usagi, ever cheerful was the first to  recover, casting a questioning glance at the three young women, two  of whom were cuddling, the third occupying herself with a sad gaze  that ended in space. Michiru and Haruka both answered to the  negative, shaking their heads. It was only then that Michiru noted  the odd expression on her adopted daughter's face.</p><p>"What  about you guys? Did any of you have weird dreams?" Her genuine  question seemed to make the youngest of the senshi even more distant  and sad, but a touch on the shoulder fixed that, causing her to perk  up immediately, startled by the sudden emergence back into the real  world. "Huh? I'm sorry, what was that?" She asked vacantly, not  entirely aware of what was said.</p><p>"I  asked if any of you had any weird dreams recently Hotaru, have you?"  Usagi was getting worried, usually the little girl was quiet and shy,  that was to be expected from an introvertive person, but never was  Hotaru known to be inattentive. That just wasn't like her, so when  she had spaced out through her question, the meatball headed  heroine's features became a concerned puzzlement. She did not have  long to wait, however, the raven haired girl responded in an odd  voice, one filled with sadness, a voice that carried throughout the  entire room, reaching all ears despite its lack of volume.</p><p>"I  was in a weird place, there were people everywhere, and they seemed  afraid of me, not strange, but they were fighting me, and I was  killing them, but they were winning. I… I used the Silence Glaive,  and… then everything goes away, the whole planet, gone." She  broke down into silent tears then, her body wracking from the sobs.  "I didn't want to hurt them, but I had to, they were bad people."  She cried because that wasn't the whole truth, she was sad because  she couldn't tell them the entire truth, she didn't think they'  accept her after something like that. She killed warriors, that  wasn't anything new, but what she couldn't bear to tell them was  that in addition to these fighters, she had killed entire families,  children, mothers nursing their babies, everyone. She couldn't tell  them that when they started to gain the upperhand, she had destroyed  a planet, annihilated it, and left its remains as a belt of  asteroids. It was for this that she cried, for the souls of those who  died so their future could be, begging forgiveness for doing so.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  felt the strength within him grow, and could touch it now, months had  passed since he had first picked up that practice weapon, since  everything had started, and now, he had reached the plateau, the same  one his mother had reached, the one she claimed that she could never  rise above. She encouraged him to create new techniques of his own,  to mark the world with a style of combat that would shake the  foundations of martial practice forever. That was what he was doing,  he realized, he had started to master this art, and would have it  perfectly integrated into his own soon enough. He realized that it  was now the time to take his stand, he needed freedom, and he had to  forsake his name to do it. With that thought he fell into sleep, mind  whirling at what would be done the next day.<p>Nodoka  felt the coming storm, it was as if it were brewing inside her,  something would happen soon, something big. She hadn't the  slightest clue how right she was.</p><p>To Be Continued...</p><p>A/N:  Well, this is it, the third chapter of IDIF, I hope you all enjoy it,  please send reviews if you do, I really like those. Anyhow, as  promised, I am setting the stage for the next part, and hope you will  enjoy it. I'll try to maintain as close to this pace as I can, but  between college and looking for work I'm going to be pretty busy  for awhile. <b>Next time: The Storm</b></p>
