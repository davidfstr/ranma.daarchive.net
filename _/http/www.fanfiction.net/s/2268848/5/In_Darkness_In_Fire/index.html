</div><p>Ranma  felt the strength within him grow, and could touch it now, months had  passed since he had first picked up that practice weapon, since  everything had started, and now, he had reached the plateau, the same  one his mother had reached, the one she claimed that she could never  rise above. She encouraged him to create new techniques of his own,  to mark the world with a style of combat that would shake the  foundations of martial practice forever. That was what he was doing,  he realized, he had started to master this art, and would have it  perfectly integrated into his own soon enough. He realized that it  was now the time to take his stand, he needed freedom, and he had to  forsake his name to do it. With that thought he fell into sleep, mind  whirling at what would be done the next day.</p><p>Nodoka  felt the coming storm, it was as if it were brewing inside her,  something would happen soon, something big. She hadn't the  slightest clue how right she was.</p><p><b>In Darkness In Fire</b></p><p>By: XZero</p><p>Disclaimer: I own  nothing.</p><p><b>Chapter 4 – Point  of No Return</b></p><p>Within the meeting  area of the pretty soldiers a tension had been drawn between them,  Setsuna's words were haunting and dangerous, if indeed there were a  threat capable of ending them entirely what would they do.  Apparently, time was something they didn't have the luxury of;  something had to be done with the one woman, a creature of immense  evil masquerading as a human. They were all indecisive, all of them  wary of this, uncomfortable with ending a life, especially one that  was in all purposes human. Setsuna had admitted that she would have  done it herself, but she didn't believe that her power alone could  handle the woman, something that had stunned the senshi. This was  their omnipotent and infallible bastion of wisdom, yet there was a  foe that she could not conquer? As one though, the thought that they  must do something solidified their resolve, something must be done.  They would strike the following night, when innocents would be safely  in their homes, away from the conflict zone. None save Hotaru were  truly hesitant.</p><p>Haruka and Michiru  were confused, all others had had a vision in their dreams, visions  that Setsuna said were warnings about the enemy they would face, a  reminder of their terrible power. As they drove those three outers  could only think about why. Hotaru's thoughts were different from  those of her parents; she was instead wondering why the people had to  die, why she had to kill again. From what she learned in school,  destroying this woman would be no different from Hitler's strike at  the Jews in World War II. She knew she couldn't share these  thoughts; her parents were too dedicated to their mission, too devout  as sailor soldiers to truly listen to her. She understood them, but  no one could understand her, and the terrible power she held,  something that made her wonder about the difference between the woman  at whom they were to strike, and whether when all was said and done  would they do the same to her, a person too powerful to leave alive.</p><p>Haruka, and her blue  haired partner alike could only wonder at the meaning behind their  lack of dreams the night before, why hadn't they received the same  warning that the other senshi had, what was different between them  that they were not warned? They could only find one answer to the  question; they were dead or not there. Both were truly disturbing and  something they didn't want to truly know the answer. This would be  one thing that would be puzzled out or left alone, the pair could  only hope that they too would receive some idea of what truly went  on, something in their dreams to reassure them of what they were  fighting for.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Usagi walked home in  not quite so silent thought, moving sluggishly through the streets,  she could not be sure, but something didn't feel right, something  about doing this, it just didn't feel right. Her downcast  expression carried her throughout the streets, and all but home, when  finally she looked up, she saw her house looming ahead. She didn't  really want to go home, because they were sure to see her troubled  mind, and ask questions she'd rather not answer. That decided she  found the ladder and silently clambered up to the roof, content to  watch the stars for a while, unknowing doing the same as a pigtailed  man, as he decided his future.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma awoke at  sunrise, the gentle yet intense light of the morning rousing him from  peaceful slumber upon his mother's roof. "Today is the day." He  yawned to himself, and rose fluidly. He stretched his back, and leapt  from his perch to the ground, landing with a soft disruption of the  dirt, nothing more. He strode calmly into the kitchen, basking in the  serenity of the house, and of his mind, trying desperately to capture  this, knowing that for quite some time turmoil would be the best of  his thoughts. He walked calmly to the table and sat, knowing that  this may be the last time he'd taste his mother's coking for  quite some time.<p>Breakfast was a grand  affair at the Saotome home this morning, mountains of food piled onto  the table. Nodoka said it was because he would need his energy today,  but he sensed something off about her mood, but didn't want to  pursue it, content instead to spend time with his mother. The auburn  haired woman seemed to come to a conclusion, and broke the  companionable silence.</p><p>"Ranma,  if ever I should die, I want you to have this sword, claim it as my  student, and as the last of our blood." He knew to what she  referred shortly after she had married, her parents had died. She had  stated that she feared that she would not live to see him married at  the rate he was dealing with women. None of that was important.</p><p>"Come on mom you're  not gonna d…" "Ranma, promise me." She countered sternly,  giving him a look that said without question that she needed this  reassurance.</p><p>"Fine mom, I will  claim the sword when you die, though I still think it will be a long  time from now." He said, finishing his breakfast. "I have to go  deal with the mess at the Tendo place, I'll see you later." He  stood to leave, and had only made it to the door before he was turned  about face to be crushed in a hug by his mother. "I love you son."  She said, her voice wavering. Ranma was dumbfounded, but could only  return her hug. "I love you too mom. I'll be back in a while, I  promise." She looked at him a moment, memorizing his features for a  moment before that serene gaze returned, she was content.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma had left his  home after giving his mother another hug, and kiss on the cheek. His  journey through Nerima didn't take long, perhaps a half hour before  he stood before the gates of the Tendo home, hoping that as he had  instructed, Nabiki had gathered the Wrecking Crew. "Only one way to  find out." He muttered and entered, wrapping himself in his  defenses. The soul of ice coated his roiling emotions in a layer of  frost as he went.<p>The Tendo dojo was  full of people, all seated throughout the dojo, wondering why he they  had been told to come here. All wondering what could be so important  that Ranma had removed them from their daily activities to get them  here? Also wondering what every other was doing here. Their idle  chatting was silenced when the pigtailed man entered, his face a mask  of icy detachment. The look on his face causing those who were about  to demand he explain himself to falter, stopping them in their tracks  as a shiver traveled down their collective spines.</p><p>"You are all  wondering why I call you here, and now you will find out why. For a  long time this has gone on, some of you chasing me, others still  after me for one reason or another. It is long past time that I gave  you all my decision." He paused for an instant, lending tension to  his words, and forestalling any interruptions by giving them a chance  to speak, no one spoke. "I, Saotome Ranma, hereby renounce my name  and all that goes with it. I am ronin." Genma winced, and nodded,  Soun along with him. That was when the two older men stood. "Saotome  Ranma, you are hereby banished from the Saotome clan, stricken from  records and mind. Your mastery of the martial arts is great, and if  you defeat me you will be granted your license to continue practicing  your art, do you accept these terms?" The pigtailed ronin nodded  his ascent. He was about to continue when Happosai followed that  statement. "Ranma, m'boy, you have been the best student I have  ever had, your ability to learn is unsurpassed, and frankly, I have  nothing left to teach you, it is time for you to grow and improve on  your own." Everyone else was still too shocked to do much anything  other than gape, even as father and son stepped outside, and took  stances facing each other on opposite sides of the koi pond, Soun  close behind to stand as judge. "The rules are simple; the first to  submit or be rendered unconscious is the loser. As fitting with our  school, this is an anything goes match. Hajime!"</p><p>No sooner had the  Tendo patriarch announced the start of the match then both opponents  leapt toward the center of the pond, coming together in a flurry of  blows. Fists and feet struck out at their opponents, each man hanging  amid the sky for what seemed forever before bounding off the other  toward the ground. That time they stood square facing the other for a  moment, checking their opponent, gauging him. They knew that Ranma  would win; he always did in the end, especially when it mattered, but  Genma refused to allow his son an easy victory. A gust of wind lifted  a leaf, and in some unspoken signal, both men returned to the air,  the Saotome School's specialty zone of combat. It was mere moments  in the air that took them to the next level of combat, pure anything  goes elevating from a contest of skill and strength, into one of  spiritual power and skill. Auras shot up around them, springing to  life as unbridled power. Both men were masters of their art; the only  difference between them was the recognition of their peers. It was  now that things were laid out, this was an all or nothing bout, and  the deep violet and golden bonfires surrounding the two men were a  testimony to the solemnity of it.</p><p>"Time to show you  what I've learned old man, get ready!" Ranma shouted as he  blurred, charging forward at extreme speed toward his father, fist  cocked back and preparing for a devastating haymaker. "We'll see  who shows who boy!" Genma blurred forth himself, striking out with  his forearm, disarming his son of his punch with a hard block which  caused a flare of both purple and gold, energy warring for dominance,  though the darker color won out, its placement meant to break and  redirect momentum. The older man struck out with a solid blow to the  solar plexus, sending the air out of the younger's chest, even as  he was sent tumbling backward.</p><p>"Soul  Flare!" Ranma bellowed as he recovered in midair, tossing a  swirling golden orb at his sensei and parent. It had taken him some  time to understand and devise this technique, having had to gain  control enough over his energies to coalesce it as an orb, and keep  it that way, but his ingenuity and perseverance had won out over the  difficulty, and the aurulent sphere impacting his father was proof. A  sick fascination washed over him as he watched the ki ball strike his  parent and explode, detonating and sending the stocky man flying  backward same as himself.</p><p>That  moment of fascination did not detract from his landing, falling  having been drilled into muscle memory long ago. Just as his feet  contacted the earth he tucked into a tight ball and rolled, springing  to his feet from such instantaneously. He was on his feet just in  time to watch Genma rise, and rose the stakes himself this time, more  power drawn from within and from without, maxing out his reserves in  a titanic display of power. It was only Genma's experience that  saved him from paling, instead raising his own power to a healthy  level, albeit one lesser than his son's.</p><p>"Shin Genma Tama!" The  brilliant dark orb shot at him, giving him barely enough time to  erect a defense. The golden glow around him concentrated into his  palms, and was the padding for his hands as he caught the blast,  though he was forced back from the pressure. He was being pushed  hard, everything from Genma's bag of tricks lain to bear.  Misdirection was a key point when fighting any opponent who was a  serious threat, and Genma was a master of that art as surely as he  was of the Anything Goes. It was a battle that required control and  precision, something the younger man had refined supremely in the  past months. "Moko Ryou!" Ranma cried, and with an inarticulate  yell to follow the first the aurulent power in his palms swelled and  shoved against the inky sphere, pushing it backward, and toward  Genma, until his blast won out, the darker lost cohesion, failing and  screening the golden beam that his son was maintaining in a steady  and tight stream.</p><p>The bald master could  not believe his eyes, after being caught almost entirely unaware; his  son had caught his ki attack, something that was practically unheard  of. What shocked him greater than that was that he pushed it back and  punched through, winning the contest of strength. He had no escape  from this, and could only brace himself for the coming impact.</p><p>A resounding explosion  rocked the foundations of the Tendo compound, marking the end of the  Aerial Anything Goes mastery duel. The inhabitants of the dojo house,  and the various martial artists and masters stepped from the wooden  training hall as the dust was clearing; standing amidst a blazing  golden aura of raw strength was the newest master of the anything  goes. Laying several yards away in a heap at the base of the compound  wall was his father, unconscious. Tendo Soun could only nod his head  solemnly, having expected this outcome; Ranma was an untamed spirit,  bound only by his own sense of honor, a fighter of unrivaled ability.  "I hereby announce the ronin Ranma the winner. With his victory, it  is my honor to be the first to welcome him as a master of the  Musabetsu Kakuto Ryuu. Congratulations son." The raven haired man  stated firmly, and then at the last, warmly. He smiled as the young  man went to his father, and collected him, walking swiftly into the  house to lay him on his futon in what used to be their bedroom.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>An hour and a half  later, the stocky master of the arts awoke, his mind hazed by his  lack of awareness, though that swiftly cleared as he recalled the  details surrounding his time lapse. "I'm proud son." He  whispered as he lifted himself to his feet, knowing that his son  would await him in the dojo. His journey there took only a moment,  and as he suspected, the raven haired young master sat in meditation.  The Saotome patriarch sat opposite him, and spoke.<p>"Ranma, this day has  been a long time coming, while I am sorry that my actions have  brought you strife, I can't help but be proud of your handling it.  You made a very difficult decision, one that has taken a great deal  from you in order to preserve the honor of many others. I regret not  telling you how proud of you I have been all these years. Please  forgive this old man for his errors." Genma spoke softly, yet there  was no trace of anything other than sincerity in his voice.</p><p>The  pigtailed ronin smiled softly. "I thank you Saotome-san, and though  it is no longer my place to call you such, I wish to convey to you  with the utmost sincerity, my gratitude, you were the only constant  throughout my life, and I will always be proud to have had the  privilege to be your son. Thank you for giving me the means to become  who I am." At that both men stood, facing each other briefly before  jumping forward to hug the other fiercely, the love a father and son  showed openly for just this once, long enough to build a memory that  they would cherish for a great deal of time to come.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Awhile later Ranma was  headed to his mother's home, his step carrying no little amount of  jubilation in it. He walked casually, and would reach his mother's  home quickly at this pace, within the next few moments in fact. That  was when he felt the spike of energy. His mother was a blazing beacon  at full strength, and this beacon shined with killing intent staining  the serenity that was usually the feel of her aura. Her energy was  waning though, and it wouldn't take much longer for her to fall  entirely. His pack forgotten he dashed toward her home, his mind  frantic about what could cause this.<p>To Be Continued…</p><p>A/N: I know I said that  I would have the end of the beginning this chapter, but this  cliffhanger was just too perfect. I intend to give you all an  emotionally heavy chapter soon so I wanted to clear the path for that  before beginning the heavy stuff.</p><p><b>Technique  Translations:</b></p><p><b>Genma Tama: </b>Dark  Horse Shot. See chapter 1, "Blood's Remembrance" for details</p><p><b>Moko Ryou: </b>Fierce  Tiger Finish. A stronger version of the Mokou Takabisha, refined and  better controlled.</p><p><b>Soul Flare:</b> This  is a rather quick adaptation of something he saw on television, while  a station was playing an old episode of Night Warriors, aka  Darkstalkers. This attack is originally used by Morrigan Aesland.</p>
