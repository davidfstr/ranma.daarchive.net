</div><br/>TitleRyoko Saotome/Title<p>The Honeymoon is Over<p>Shampoo looked about the waiting room part of Dr.<br/>Tofu's clinic/house. She saw Dr. Tofu, the nice-girl<br/>~Why isn't he acting weird around her? Oh, right,<br/>they finally got married.~ There was the lost-boy, and<br/>Ranma's mother. She did not see Ranma.<br/>"Nihao!" Shampoo declared happily. "Have new<br/>patient." She stepped to the side to allow a rather<br/>forlorn looking green-haired girl inside. The girl,<br/>obviously an Amazon, was cradling her hand and looking<br/>surprised. A sheepish Ukyou followed behind her.<br/>Ryouga glanced at Ukyou and shrugged, indicating<br/>his confusion over how the Amazons had gotten there.<br/>Ukyou shook her head back in a "I hate today manner."<br/>"Would have visit sooner, but spatula-girl insist<br/>on full tour of new restaurant," Shampoo noted. "Then<br/>Ran-Ran want spar with spatula-girl."<br/>"I take it that's how she hurt her hand," Dr. Tofu<br/>said as he walked over to take the injured hand and<br/>examine it. "Several minor fractures, they should<br/>heal soon. I take it you discovered Ukyou's been<br/>training with her fiancee."<br/>"She never say anything about baksai tenketsu,"<br/>Ran-Ran said still surprised. "Would have been more<br/>careful if she did." Ukyou giggled nervously, while<br/>Ryouga snickered at the thought of an Amazon hurting<br/>themselves by punching a baksai tenketsu enhanced<br/>person.<br/>"Oh my," Kasumi said. "Couldn't you have dodged,<br/>Ukyou?"<br/>"Hey, I didn't want totally humiliate her," Ukyou<br/>said in her defense.<br/>"Ran-Ran should have guessed when trident snap on<br/>spatula-girl's head," Shampoo noted shaking her head<br/>in disappointment. Then the purple-haired Amazon<br/>turned to Nodoka. "Ranma-mother left very fast, I did<br/>not have a chance to greet you."<br/>"I apologize for the rush, Shampoo-san," Nodoka<br/>said. "I had to come here as soon as possible, you<br/>see my..."<br/>"...Husband is embedded in sidewalk?" Shampoo<br/>interrupted. Everybody looked at Ukyou again, she<br/>sweatdropped.<br/>"No, I must have missed that, though it would<br/>explain the upside down trash can" Nodoka said. "The<br/>reason I'm here is..."<br/>"That stupid panda actually told me girls couldn't<br/>be good martial artists," Ukyou snapped angrily.<br/>"He did WHAT?" Ryouga snapped.<br/>"Panda-man deserve much more pain for that,"<br/>Shampoo noted sagely.<br/>"Is ai.." Shampoo knocked the younger Amazon on the<br/>head. "Is big-sister's ex here?" The "ex" comment<br/>earned another head bap from Shampoo.<br/>"Yes, my son is here..."<br/>"For his physical!" Ukyou snapped. "Right,<br/>Ryouga?" She moved to sit next to him and nudged the<br/>lost boy.<br/>"Uh...yeah right!" Ryouga nervously noted Ukyou<br/>taking a good whiff of him and hoped the bath had<br/>washed all the sake smell away. The narrowed look in<br/>her eyes told him otherwise.<br/>"Then why Doctor here and not with Ranma?" Shampoo<br/>asked. Kasumi sighed expressively, Ukyou didn't have<br/>all the necessary talent to come up with on the spot<br/>scams. At least they hadn't noticed the muffled<br/>argument and door slamming further back in the<br/>building.<br/>"I do not know what foolishness you people are<br/>talking about," Nodoka said.<br/>"When did I say something foo..." Ryouga snapped<br/>his mouth shut as Nodoka drew her katana.<br/>"Now as I was saying, several times," Nodoka<br/>accented the last two words with a polite, if annoyed,<br/>tone. "My son is here because his wife was injured."<br/>"WIFE!" Shampoo shouted. "I mean I'm happy for<br/>Ranma." Nobody believed her.<br/>"But big-sister say...oww!" Ran-Ran rubbed her head<br/>with her good hand.<p>"I'm not going to need your help," Ryoko growled.<br/>Ignoring Ranma's reaction to the word "Nihao." "I<br/>just need a drink." Ryoko stood up and began looking<br/>through drawers.<br/>"I think you have enough problems," Ranma muttered.<br/>He shook his head watching her. "You really think<br/>that the Doc left any of that gunk around this room?"<br/>"There's got to be some around here," Ryoko<br/>muttered. Ranma noted that she was still sweating and<br/>leaning heavily on the counters. She slammed the last<br/>door closed and growled in frustration. "Where is it!<br/>Doctors always have something around. Brandy, sake,<br/>scotch..something!"<br/>"Man, you're stupid," Ryoko turned to growl at him.<br/>"The only thing you NEED to drink is water, and<br/>then..."<br/>"Fine, I'll GET some water!" Ryoko turned to the<br/>sink at the counter, quietly bent the faucet and<br/>turned on the water. "Happy...Pinky?"<br/>"Not. Really." Ranma-chan said glaring at her hair.<br/>"The only color worse than blonde." Ryoko smirked<br/>and stalked towards the door. "You REALLY don't<br/>want to go out there right now."<br/>"And why not?"<br/>"WIFE!" Somebody shouted.<br/>"Answer your question?" Ranma-chan asked snidely.<br/>"That's IT!" Ryoko snapped, continuing out towards<br/>the lobby.<br/>"Miao?" Ryo-Ohki did her best to speak slowly and<br/>quietly, and was satisfied that Ranma-chan merely<br/>gritted her teeth. He glanced at the cabbit before<br/>following Ryoko.<br/>"Hey, idiot, you have to get some rest," Ranma-chan<br/>insisted before following. She stopped upon seeing<br/>Ryoko silently staring into the waiting room.<br/>"Ryoko?" Ranma-chan caught up to Ryoko and looked<br/>into the waiting room and saw her mother and Shampoo<br/>looking towards them.<br/>"So is this your wife, Ranma?" his mother asked<br/>politely, sheathing her katana and moving forward.<br/>"Ayeka?" Ryoko asked quietly, ignoring everybody<br/>aside from Shampoo.<br/>"She look like she see ghost," Shampoo noted,<br/>curiously. Ryoko narrowed her eyes angrily.<br/>"How did you es..."<br/>"Look at her, Shampoo," Ranma interrupted. Ryoko<br/>blinked and looked back to Shampoo, shoulders<br/>slumping. "She ain't exactly in the best shape."<br/>The pirate dropped back into the hallway, desire to<br/>confront these people gone.<br/>"Excuse me," Kasumi said, following the woman.<br/>Ranma-chan shifted to let her by.<br/>"I'd like to ask at least some of you to leave,"<br/>Dr. Tofu suggested firmly. "There are too many people<br/>here."<br/>"Yeah, I need to talk to Ryouga about some things,"<br/>Ukyou said, standing up. She glanced back towards<br/>where Ryoko had gone back out of sight. "And maybe<br/>chain him to the door until the wedding."<br/>"Stupid lost boy," Shampoo shook her head, as the<br/>couple walked out the door.<br/>"You still haven't fixed hand," Ran-Ran reminded<br/>him.<br/>"I can take care of that," Dr. Tofu said. "Just<br/>follow me this won't take long at all." Ran-Ran<br/>nodded and followed the doctor, brushing against<br/>Ranma-chan as she passed.<br/>"Oh, excuse please," she said cheerily, and wincing<br/>at the cold look she was getting. Nodoka cleared her<br/>throat, attracting attention from Ranma.<br/>"I apparently have to see about extricating your<br/>father from the sidewalk outside Ucchans'" Nodoka<br/>said. "But your wife is welcome to stay with us,<br/>however short a time this marriage lasts, she is<br/>obviously upset ."<br/>"I don't think that's going to happen," Ranma-chan<br/>said, shaking her head. "But I'll tell her."<br/>"Very good," Nodoka smiled and looked to the<br/>doorway. "Not a very traditional woman, hmm." The<br/>Saotome matriarch left Shampoo and Ranma in the room<br/>alone.<p>"Ryoko-san," Kasumi called sweetly, she found the<br/>pirate in the kitchen, searching through drawers<br/>again. The cabbit sat on the counter watching her<br/>worriedly. "You won't find anything with alcohol, we<br/>did think to hide it." Ryoko turned to blink at her.<br/>"The only reason I'm going through withdrawl is<br/>that somebody tossed my sake," she snapped. "Do you<br/>think I want to be sober!"<br/>"Probably not," Kasumi answered, smiling. "Sit<br/>down, I'll make you something that will help you feel<br/>better."<br/>"I good shot of something will do just fine," Ryoko<br/>said irritably. She did find a chair and sat down,<br/>however. The brown haired woman walked about the<br/>kitchen collecting various fruits and vegetables.<br/>"Who was this woman that attacked you?"<br/>"That was Nagi," Ryoko spat.<br/>"I see," Kasumi said. Ryoko heard the sound of a<br/>blender and watched as Kasumi poured the resulting<br/>drink into a glass. "And who is Ayeka?"<br/>"What are you talking about?" Ryoko demanded as<br/>Kasumi carried the drink over to her. She looked<br/>questionably at the drink and took a sip.<br/>"You called Shampoo, 'Ayeka'," Kasumi said, she<br/>watched carefully as Ryoko took a bigger drink from<br/>the glass. "And were asking her how she escaped when<br/>Ranma interrupted. Quite lucky, since you are in no<br/>condition to be fighting Shampoo, or anybody."<br/>"Don't you people mind your own business? What do<br/>you know about it?" Kasumi looked at her for a<br/>moment.<br/>"Have you heard the name Akane yet?"<br/>"Yes, so?"<br/>"She was my sister, I practically raised her,"<br/>Kasumi said, a tear escaping her eyes. "She's been<br/>dead four years now."<br/>"Was it your fault?" Ryoko asked sullenly.<br/>"No, but it feels like it at times. I doubt<br/>your...friend's death was your fault either," Kasumi<br/>said.<br/>"Nagi killed her and Tenchi," Ryoko said. "My<br/>enemy, my fault."<br/>"Could you have done anything to stop it?"<br/>"I wasn't conscious," Ryoko growled. "I should<br/>have died WITH them, if SHE hadn't gotten me to a<br/>doctor." Kasumi looked to the cabbit at her side.<br/>"Miao!" Ryo-Ohki sounded like she was lecturing.<br/>"So you were not even aware it was happening."<br/>"That's NOT the point," Ryoko growled quietly. She<br/>didn't know exactly why she felt like explaining<br/>herself to this person, and she wasn't about to do it<br/>any more.<br/>"And what is the point?" Kasumi asked. Ryoko<br/>narrowed her eyes and looked at the empty glass.<br/>"Can I have another one of these?" she asked.<br/>"Certainly," Kasumi smiled and stood up to pour the<br/>remainder of the contents of the blender into the<br/>glass she took from Ryoko. "I for one am glad you are<br/>here, for Ranma's sake if nothing else."<br/>"I'm NOT staying married to him," Ryoko said<br/>firmly.<br/>"Of course not," Kasumi said, sweetly. "I was not<br/>suggesting that at all." Ryoko watched the<br/>brown-haired woman cautiously as she accepted the<br/>glass back.<p>"Have you been drinking?" Ukyou asked sweetly as<br/>soon as they were out of sight of the clinic.<br/>"Not since that one time, I swear!" Ryouga said.<br/>Ukyou thought as much, but she didn't get very many<br/>openings like this. Well, they came fairly often.<br/>Okay, so she tended to make them even if they weren't<br/>there, teasing Ryouga was fun and easy.<br/>"Then why do you stink of sake?"<br/>"It...it..it started raining sake bottles," he<br/>stammered. Ukyou blinked in surprise.<br/>~And Ryoko is going through withdrawl...uh<br/>oh...off that track for now,~ Ukyou retrieved her<br/>normal cheerful expression. "I'll buy that this one<br/>time, sugar. So how'd you end up with Ranma and Ryoko<br/>anyway?"<br/>"I followed the bounty hunter that attacked her,"<br/>Ryouga said. Ukyou stopped and shook her head.<br/>"How does Ranma manage it?" she asked.<br/>"She wanted the lady to kill her," Ryouga added.<br/>Ukyou had about the same reaction as Ryouga had<br/>earlier.<br/>"We left someone like that alone with RANMA!"<br/>Ukyou started to turn around and found herself facing<br/>Nodoka Saotome.<br/>"I think Dr. Tofu and Kasumi can handle matters,"<br/>Ranma's mother said. "Now, I believe you need to<br/>explain to me as to why my husband is embedded into<br/>your sidewalk."<br/>"He deserved it."<p>"You're just here for Ukyou's wedding, right<br/>Shampoo?" Ranma-chan asked levelly. Shampoo resisted<br/>the urge to fall into a battle stance. There was<br/>nothing overly hostile in Ranma's attitude, but at the<br/>moment he didn't seem to be overly anything.<br/>"We come here to live," Shampoo said defiantly.<br/>"Mousse, my sisters and I."<br/>"Why?"<br/>"Amazon business," Shampoo said, crossing her arms.<br/>"You are not Amazon, is not your business."<br/>"No marriage plans of your own?"<br/>"Stupid, I already married," Shampoo said.<br/>Ranma-chan looked to where Ran-Ran had disappeared and<br/>arched an eyebrow, she then turned to face Shampoo<br/>again.<br/>"How about her?"<br/>"I don't know what's in her head," Shampoo said, it<br/>wasn't quite a lie.<br/>"One accidental marriage is more than enough, I<br/>don't need that mess starting again." Shampoo<br/>narrowed her eyes, but said nothing. At this point<br/>Dr. Tofu returned with Ran-Ran, her hand wrapped up.<br/>"You know better Shampoo."<br/>"Hand all better," the younger Amazon said<br/>cheerfully, trying unsuccessfully to lighten the chill<br/>mood.<br/>"Your heart beat, you should not stay dead!"<br/>Shampoo snapped, before waving the confused Ran-Ran<br/>over and leaving with her younger sister.<br/>"She means well, Ranma," the doctor lectured him.<br/>"Everybody means well," Ranma-chan said.<p>"Everybody gone?" Ryoko asked as a male Ranma<br/>appeared in Kasumi and Tofu's kitchen. She was<br/>drinking another of Kasumi's herb and fruit blends,<br/>and irritably having to admit that she did feel,<br/>indeed, better.<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said. He glanced about, again<br/>surprised at the small table and chairs that Kasumi<br/>kept in the kitchen. The actual dining room was more<br/>traditional, like he would have expected from Kasumi,<br/>but he guessed this was easier for just a couple.<br/>"Excuse me," Kasumi said politely, standing up. "I<br/>have some more studying to do." Ryoko and Ranma eyed<br/>her with open irritation as she left with an amused<br/>smile on her face.<br/>"She's trying to match us up," Ryoko said,<br/>unnecessarily.<br/>"And Ukyou and Ryouga, and maybe my mother," Ranma<br/>added. "Though she thinks I just married you to get a<br/>one-night stand." Ryoko stared as Ranma sat down and<br/>let his head fall to the table.<br/>"And she's okay with that?" Ryoko asked.<br/>"It stretches the limits of 'manliness' but<br/>otherwise, yeah," Ranma said without picking up his<br/>head.<br/>"I could get to like her," Ryoko said, without<br/>joking. Ranma looked up and fixed her with a confused<br/>glance.<br/>"Nani?"<br/>"Sounds like she's not near as anal as she seemed,"<br/>Ryoko shrugged.<br/>"You're both weird," Ranma said shaking his head.<br/>"You turn into a woman when you get wet, and you<br/>call me weird?"<br/>"My mom invited you to stay at our place," Ranma<br/>said, changing the subject before things degenerated<br/>into a shouting match. There were times he COULD keep<br/>the Saotome mouth in check. "That actually sounds<br/>like a good idea." Ryoko stared at him, arching an<br/>eyebrow.<br/>"And why is that?" Ryoko asked irritably.<br/>"Food, close to friends, easier to get to Tofu's<br/>without calling down American fighter planes..."<br/>"Nani?"<br/>"Ask, Ryo-Ohki," Ranma said pointing at a suddenly<br/>innocent looking cabbit. "Anyway, the only problems<br/>would be Oyaji, but with Mom around he shouldn't be<br/>too bad, and appearances."<br/>Ryoko wanted to say she insisted on the shrine, but<br/>her stomach was already loudly protesting the thought<br/>of four more days of cereal. Besides which she no<br/>longer was certain just how far Nagi was willing to<br/>go. For all Ryoko knew, she might show up just as<br/>Ryoko got healthy enough to put up a fight, but not<br/>enough to win.<br/>"Do I have a choice?" she asked irritably.<br/>Internally she was running a last benefit through her<br/>head. ~This way I can get my powers back quicker and<br/>show this punk what I'm REALLY like, good warm-up for<br/>Nagi.~<br/>"Of course you do," Ranma said. Ryoko stared at<br/>him and blinked. "Nani?"<br/>~Damn it, he's giving me the choice, then again<br/>he'll probably follow me anywhere anyway.~ Ryoko<br/>shrugged. "Might as well, if I have to have you<br/>around, it might as well be comfortable."<br/>"You're saying yes!" Ranma blinked.<br/>"What did you think I'd do?"<br/>"Miao?" Ryoko looked to the confused cabbit.<br/>"I don't know why he's hitting his head again,"<br/>Ryoko said.<p>"Well how'd..."<br/>*SLAM* Mousse watched his wife stomp past with<br/>Ran-Ran following behind slightly confused.<br/>"He accused me of trying to set him up!" Shampoo<br/>snapped off in Chinese. "I barely got to talk!"<br/>"But you are trying to get him to marry me,"<br/>Ran-Ran said. "Aren't you?"<br/>"Not the point!" Shampoo snapped. "The point is he<br/>didn't give me the chance to prove otherwise."<br/>"He hasn't known you to do much else," Mousse<br/>noted, Shampoo ignored him.<br/>"But since you brought it up, little-sister. What<br/>did I say about how to approach this?"<br/>"You said I shouldn't be obvious," Ran-Ran said.<br/>"So what was that brushing against him thing?"<br/>"Shampoo!" Mousse snapped.<br/>"What!"<br/>"This is Ranma we're talking about," he said. "It<br/>wouldn't be obvious to him unless you shouted your<br/>intentions from the roof tops."<br/>"Like Shampoo shouted when she here Ranma married?"<br/>Ran-Ran asked.<br/>"Gee...sounds like you dug you're own grave,"<br/>Mousse sighed.<br/>"The restaurant looks nice," Shampoo commented,<br/>sagely ignoring her embarrassment. Mousse chuckled<br/>quietly in amusement at her, Shampoo mock growled and<br/>returned to examining the restaurant.<br/>"Big-sister Shampoo isn't..." Shampoo glared at<br/>Ran-Ran and the girl's cheerful witticism died.<br/>"uhhh...wrong...its in very good condition."<p>"Excuse me, Genma," Nodoka said, looking down at<br/>Genma. "But I've heard a few things about your<br/>behavior today."<br/>"What do you mean by that dear?"<br/>"Do you really want me to list the charges?" she<br/>asked. Genma sweatdropped. "Good, now I have invited<br/>this Ryoko person to stay out our home for the next<br/>few days."<br/>"But we can't afford a freeloader," Genma declared.<br/>"And if this Ryoko is a fragile little thing then<br/>she's bound to be picky as well...it is a bad idea to<br/>encourage a wedding with someone we know nothing<br/>about."<br/>"Hmmm, I think we should get you out of there<br/>before continuing this discussion," Genma turned to<br/>Ryouga and Ukyou. "Kuonji-san, didn't your fiancee<br/>say you needed some work on your baksai tenketsu<br/>accuracy?"<br/>"Yeah, he did," Ukyou smiled evily and looked over<br/>to where Genma was embedded in the sidewalk. "Can you<br/>move aside please, Mrs. Saotome?"<br/>"Certainly," the Saotome matriarch moved away from<br/>her immobile and worried husband.<br/>"Can you do the trick with the spatula's again?"<br/>Ryouga asked. It was one of the few baksai tenketsu<br/>tricks she had come up with on her own. Of course,<br/>she was much better with weapons than he was.<br/>"Sure! I haven't been able to do much more than a<br/>basic blast with those."<br/>"Umm...we could..." Genma watched as he was<br/>circled in mini-spatulas, shortly before the ground<br/>exploded around and underneath him. The other three<br/>watched him disappear into a LEO and calculated that<br/>he was going to land in the canal. "...taaallkkk...<br/>abbooouuuttt...thiiiiisssssss!"<br/>"Well now that that's over with," Ukyou smirked<br/>towards Ryouga, leaning close. "Why don't we see<br/>about washing that stink off of you?"<br/>Ryouga glanced toward an intrigued Nodoka and<br/>blushed. Ukyou restrained herself from laughing<br/>before continuing in a sultry tone.<br/>"I told Konatsu that I'll handle the inventory, so<br/>it's JUST us. I could help get those hard to<br/>reach..." Ryouga's nose started to bleed and fell back<br/>in a faint. "Got him!" Ukyou giggled.<br/>"Kuonji-san, it is not exactly proper to be<br/>discussing these things in public," Nodoka lectured.<br/>"Yeah, but its a lot more fun to tease Ryouga in<br/>public," Ukyou said, she gestured to the unconscious<br/>martial-artist.<br/>"I see," Nodoka said. "For a moment I thought he<br/>had not yet been cured of his shyness." As Ukyou<br/>dragged Ryouga along, Nodoka examined the impact<br/>crater from his fall and sweatdropped.<p>Kodachi snapped her head up from the chemicals she<br/>was working with to look back at the mirror. For a<br/>moment she thought she had seen...<br/>"Boo." Kodachi whipped her head around to see<br/>Konatsu standing next to her a big grin on his face.<br/>"Konatsu-chan!" she blinked.<br/>"You actually saw me coming this time,<br/>Kodachi-sama," Konatsu noted pridefully.<br/>"Of course," Kodachi noted pridefully. "I am the<br/>Black Rose, truly it must be a mountainous task to try<br/>and approach me unawares."<br/>~Well, its almost as difficult as stepping over a<br/>log now,~ Konatsu thought, still smiling. "You<br/>certainly see things more clearly than your...peers."<br/>It was a safer word to use than relatives.<br/>"That is a lovely kimono by the way," Kodachi<br/>added.<br/>"You think so?" Konatsu chimed, blushing.<br/>"Oh, definitely," Kodachi nodded, cocking her head<br/>to get a better look. "It contrasts your dark hair<br/>quite beautifully. I must say that I am quite<br/>jealous." Kodachi couldn't understand how Ukyou had<br/>gone for that rather dense barbarian over the ninja.<br/>It was hard to find a man with good sense of female<br/>fashion, as dating material at least.<br/>"Oh please," Konatsu waved off the comment. "That<br/>dress you wore last week was much more elegant and<br/>becoming."<br/>"Yes, I did draw quite a bit of attention didn't<br/>I?" Kodachi agreed haughtily. Konatsu forbear to<br/>mention that it was mostly because people had thought<br/>they were both women. "But I did not expect to be<br/>treated to your presence until Apollo had driven his<br/>chariot back to his abode. Do you not have to help<br/>Kuonji-san with her inventory today?"<br/>"Ukyou told me she'd handle it," Konatsu said.<br/>"Then you can teach my some of your escape<br/>methods?" Kodachi asked, hopefully. Konatsu blushed,<br/>Kodachi did NOT need his help in learning how to<br/>escape bonds.<br/>"Uh...Kodachi-sama, before we discuss...training,"<br/>Konatsu fidgeted. "You should know that your family<br/>ninja finally learned about Ranma-san's marriage."<br/>"Oh, what a bother," Kodachi sighed. "I suppose<br/>I'm going to be paying for another hospital stay,<br/>aren't I."<br/>"Not too mention court fees," Konatsu nodded. "Why<br/>do you bother paying for him anyway?"<br/>"I did promise Ranma to try and handle my brother,"<br/>Kodachi reminded him. "It was the least I could do<br/>after breaking his heart and leaving him when I did."<br/>The translation was that she had gotten tired and<br/>bored with him while he was still totally ignoring the<br/>world in the months after Akane's death.<br/>"Uh...right," Konatsu blinked.<br/>"WHAT DID YOU SAY?" Kodachi and Konatsu turned towards the shout.<br/>"Excuse me, I'll be right back," Kodachi cheered happily, leaving to deal with her brother.<br/>"The vile Saotome dares take a wife after the death<br/>of the virtuous Akane Tendo?"<br/>"The city records are quite certain of the matter,<br/>master."<br/>"At last Saotome has revealed his evil by betraying<br/>the memory of that fair flower of womanhood. Surely<br/>his magic must be weakening if the foul find must try<br/>such obvious ploys."<br/>"Of course master," Sasuke rolled his eyes.<br/>"Brother-dear," Kodachi tsked from the doorway. "I<br/>seem to remember a restraining order, and I have no<br/>desire to contiue digging you out of trouble."<br/>"These mere peasant laws have no hold on a scion of<br/>the house of Kuno! And how would they expect to hold<br/>me? Would you stop me, dear-sister?"<br/>"Why should I bother?" Kodachi shrugged. ~I will<br/>have a chat with Ranma about not inviting me to the<br/>wedding though. When I told him I would no longer<br/>seek to marry him I did not mean that I wanted to cut<br/>him out of my life completely.~ Some unconscious part<br/>of Kodachi's mind tried to remind her that he had been<br/>in something like a coma at the time. The message<br/>failed miserably.<br/>"Of course you must realize that you're feeble<br/>attempts would fail before my divine might!" Kuno<br/>declared to his sister. She stared at him for a<br/>moment before collasping to the ground in uncontroled<br/>laughter.<br/>"OH-HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!"<br/>"Would you please stop that sister?" Kuno asked.<br/>"It is most annoying."<br/>"Perhaps if you didn't provide her with such an<br/>ample source of amusment, master?" Sasuke suggested.<br/>"QUIET SASUKE!" Kodachi, paused a moment, looked<br/>at her brother and then collapsed in laughter again.<br/>"OH-HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!"<p>Back to Ryoko Saotome
