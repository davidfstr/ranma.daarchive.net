</div><br/>TitleRyoko Saotome/Title<p>Love Hurts<p>Ukyou was irritable, after this morning she had a<br/>good right to be. The news had spread, it seemed.<br/>This morning she had to deal with Genma. He had not<br/>seemed as happy about the accidental marriage as<br/>Nodoka was.<p>"Oh great," Ukyou growled upon seeing them outside<br/>her restaurant. "What do you two want?"<br/>"I heard that Ranma is married!" Genma said. Ukyou<br/>laughed.<br/>"Not for long," she answered him. "Some bureaucrat<br/>screwed up. Almost sounded like something you'd do to<br/>him."<br/>"What are you talking about? I would never stoop<br/>to such a..." he shut up at look both Ukyou was<br/>giving him.<br/>"Anyway, THIS relationship isn't likely to last<br/>more than the week for the clerk's office to open<br/>again," Ukyou said. "Too bad, I think they'd get<br/>along."<br/>"Ukyou, please tell me you're not serious," Genma<br/>pleaded, on his knees. Ukyou was suddenly very<br/>suspicious.<br/>"You didn't get this worked up when I dated him,"<br/>Ukyou said, levely. She started to walk away from her<br/>restaurant, uncomfortable with where this was going.<br/>"Well, you're a martial artist," Genma said without<br/>thinking. "I don't want to see my boy married to some<br/>frilly little girl that'll twist his mind away from<br/>the Art."<br/>"Your son has spent the last four years like a<br/>zombie..." Ukyou nearly shreiked.<br/>"Perfecting the Soul of Ice," Genma protested.<br/>"Perfecting LIFELESSNESS! Do you mean to say that<br/>all you care about is if his wife will be a good<br/>martial artist?" Ukyou slapped herself mentally, why<br/>Genma have to look like everything as if it were a<br/>training exercise of some kind?<br/>"Cologne not with standing, isn't a good female<br/>martial artist a contradiction in terms?"<br/>"What?" The Neriman locals were then treated to<br/>the site of Genma Saotome being hammered into the<br/>ground. "JACKASS!" Ukyou couldn't wait to talk to<br/>Nodoka again.<p>"Today just can't get any worse," Ukyou growled.<br/>She glanced at a long abandoned building as she walked<br/>along, then stopped and looked back. "I may have been<br/>wrong." A small work crew was going over the old<br/>building carefully. Cleaning, inspecting, and<br/>generally improving it.<br/>"Ukyou Kuonji?" Ukyou turned at her surprise and<br/>looked up at a tall chinese man in white robes.<br/>"Shampoo and Ran-Ran just left to pay their respects<br/>to you."<br/>"And they left you here?" Mousse laughed.<br/>"Somebody needs to be here to keep an eye on<br/>things," Mousse gestured toward what he thought was<br/>the work crew.<br/>"Why would you need to keep an eye on that shell<br/>game?" Ukyou asked curiously. Mousse squinted in the<br/>general direction he had waved and growled.<br/>"You know what I meant," he snapped. "At any rate,<br/>I thought Shampoo should announce themselves to the<br/>bride-to-be," Ukyou blushed. "And offered to handle<br/>the work of fixing up the Nekohanten."<br/>"In other words you thought she might just get in<br/>the way of dealing with the contractors," Ukyou said.<br/>~Great, I have competition again. Wait a minute.~<br/>"Her intercultural skills could still use some<br/>polishing," Mousse admitted diplomatically.<br/>"Who is Ran-Ran?" Ukyou asked. Mousse got nervous.<br/>"She's one of Shampoo's little sisters."<br/>"I thought she was an only child," Ukyou said.<br/>~This can't all be happening again, Ranma'll snap!~<br/>"Oh, they just call each other sisters," Mousse<br/>said. "Her blood-sister and husband will join us in a<br/>few months."<br/>"What are you all doing, starting a colony?"<br/>"Actually, yes."<br/>"Ran-Ran is single, isn't she," Ukyou said. Mousse<br/>laughed nervously. Ukyou sighed in frustration.<br/>~This is definitely worse.~<p>Ryoko woke with a start, she'd been in the halls of<br/>the Yagami again, trying to convince Tenchi not to go.<br/>Why couldn't he have just seen that his task was<br/>impossible, he would be alive now. Kagato had<br/>defeated her without a fight, and overpowered even<br/>Yosho and the knights.<br/>Ryoko sighed, and leaned forward trying to shake<br/>off the dream. At least she'd woken up before the<br/>dream had gotten really bad. Before she could again<br/>start filling in the information she wasn't certain<br/>of. Being sober made it a little difficult, she<br/>needed a distraction.<br/>She caught her reflection in one of the many<br/>mirrors to shield against evil spirits, and groaned.<br/>She had guessed as much by the general level of<br/>discomfort she was feeling, but the pallor she was<br/>developing proved it.<br/>"Great, withdrawal," she muttered. So of course<br/>that shivering wasn't because she was cold.<br/>Looking up and around she realized three things.<br/>First, it was a lot earlier than she was used to<br/>getting up. Second, the shrine was in terrible<br/>condition. Third, there was this wonderful smell<br/>drifting up from where the house should have been.<br/>"AH! What are you doing there?" Ranma shouted as<br/>Ryoko appeared across from him, looking almost like a<br/>ghost. Ranma decided not to mention anything about<br/>last night, after his third ride into the lake he<br/>doubted she would want to talk about it.<br/>Ryoko was at first looking at the pot he had<br/>suspended over the fire, and turned her face upward<br/>towards him and smiled seductively. Ranma blinked and<br/>then narrowed his eyes.<br/>"Rannma, that smells so wonderful," she purred. "I<br/>was wondering, if I could maybe haave some?"<br/>"Are you feeling okay Ryoko?" Ranma asked flatly.<br/>She wasn't, mentally or physically, but she had no<br/>intention of dying by starvation. She came around the<br/>fire and leaned against him. "Would you stop that<br/>please?" Ryoko blinked at the unenthused tone of<br/>voice, and then sat back and crossed her arms.<br/>"All I want is a good home-cooked breakfast," she<br/>pouted. "Is that too much to ask?" Ranma rolled his<br/>eyes and sighed.<br/>"If I cook you some food will you leave me alone?"<br/>"Leave YOU alone?" Ryoko snapped. ~That's not<br/>fair, most guys just melt at that. And here HE wants<br/>me to just leave him alone.~ "I live here!"<br/>"I'm not exactly here by choice, either," Ranma<br/>snapped. Oddly enough Ryoko was actually relieved by<br/>his outburst.<br/>"How will they know where you were the entire<br/>time," Ryoko asked. "You can leave anytime you want<br/>to."<br/>"You don't know much about honor, do you?" Ranma<br/>asked as he handed her a bowl and started kicking<br/>another serving for himself. "I can't just leave or<br/>I'd be nothing but some jerk that knows how to fight!"<br/>"You're right about the jerk part," Ryoko snapped<br/>back as she poked at the rice and vegetables in the<br/>bowl. "Are these carrots?"<br/>"Yeah, I saved some from that rabbit-thing of<br/>yours."<br/>"No meat?" Ryoko asked confused. Ranma shuffled<br/>uncomfortably.<br/>"I didn't bring any," he said. "And I'm a little<br/>nervous about just snatching animals out of the wild.<br/>You look terrible." Ryoko glared at him.<br/>"It's been more than a day since I had a drink,"<br/>she reminded him. "Ever hear of withdrawal?"<br/>"Isn't that where you ignore the world around you?"<br/>"No!" Ryoko snapped. "It's what happens when you<br/>suddenly stop taking a drug like...I don't<br/>know...alchohol!"<br/>"Oh, how bad is it?" he asked, suddenly wondering<br/>if tossing all the alcohol had been a bad idea. He'd<br/>heard giving up drinking was difficult, he'd never<br/>bothered to ask why.<br/>"Not as bad as it's going to be," Ryoko muttered.<br/>"Miao!" Ryo-Ohki declared happily, surprising both<br/>of them. For once both Ryoko and Ranma had similar<br/>reactions. Ryoko nearly choked on her rice and Ranma<br/>went for the trees again.<br/>"What did you say?" Ryoko demanded.<br/>"Miao!" In response to Ryo-Ohki's second outburst,<br/>Ranma jumped down and growled irritably.<br/>~Shit, shit, shit!~ Ryoko ate her rice with<br/>something closer to her usual rate of speed. ~I<br/>didn't think she'd show up for another day or so!~<br/>"I wish that thing would let me see it BEFORE it<br/>says something." He sat down and returned to cooking<br/>his breakfast.<br/>"Her name is Ryo-Ohki," Ryoko snapped irritably.<br/>"Now, I'M going BACK up there and try to sleep through<br/>the next twenty four hours." ~Now there's an<br/>impossible dream.~<br/>"Is this part of your withdrawal, or is it that<br/>time of the month?" Ranma prepared himself for another<br/>trip to the lake.<br/>"You..." Ryoko cut off her shout and smirked,<br/>leaning forward with seductive grace only a little<br/>ruined by her pallor and sweat. "I don't know, Want<br/>to risk it?"<br/>"Errr...not really."<br/>"Didn't think so," Ryoko said, a victorious look on<br/>her face. "Later jerk!" She walked off.<br/>"Now she's trying to seduce me for food?" Ranma<br/>blinked. This was a quite a difference from "Don't<br/>you even think about it," a couple of days ago. He<br/>turned to the cabbit, cricking his neck in preparation<br/>for the response. "Is she like this most of the<br/>time?"<br/>"Miao," Ryo-Ohki responded with a long suffering<br/>nod.<p>Ryouga looked about and tried to figure out where<br/>he was. He was at what seemed to be a shrine of some<br/>kind. That was moderately surprising, the blue haired<br/>woman he'd been following didn't seem to be the type<br/>that's very interested in religion.<br/>Then he saw Ryoko walk up to the top of the stairs<br/>appearing rather tired and sick. Ryouga stopped and<br/>sighed, he was right. This woman was connected to<br/>Ryoko, considering their similar tastes in pets it<br/>seemed likely. Then there was that hair, maybe they<br/>were sisters or something.<br/>"You're even more pathetic than last time Ryoko,"<br/>the blue haired woman said quietly. Ryoko stopped and<br/>looked as the woman Ryouga had followed stepped out of<br/>the shadows.<br/>"Nagi," Ryoko said, and smiled. "Come to take the<br/>bounty?"<br/>~Bounty?~ Ryouga sweatdropped. ~She's a<br/>criminal!~<br/>"Haven't you seen the news yet Ryoko?" Nagi asked<br/>quietly. "It has been more than a month since the<br/>battle."<br/>"I saw enough. Tenchi's dead, what else do I need<br/>to know." Ryoko growled. She dropped into a sloppy<br/>stance and glared at the other woman. "Now, are we<br/>going to have this fight or not?" Nagi smirked and<br/>reached out with her weapon to jab Ryoko in the side.<br/>Ryoko gritted her teeth and dropped to one knee.<br/>"You still haven't gotten that healed?" she tsked.<br/>"What do you do, open it every couple of days."<br/>"Get out of my face Nagi," Ryoko lunged forward<br/>with a punch that Nagi dodged.<br/>~Call for Ranma idiot!~ Ryouga thought. ~You<br/>almost act like...~ The martial-artist in pig form<br/>took a closer look at the silver-haired woman.<br/>~Kami-Sama, we set RANMA as a suicide watch?~<br/>"You are in NO shape to give me the fight I want,"<br/>Nagi said laughing sarcastically. "Don't you even<br/>have your powers?"<br/>"Shut up and fight!" Ryoko growled, she snapped a<br/>kick, a forward thrust made sloppy by the pull on her<br/>injury. Nagi easily blocked the kick and used Ryoko's<br/>leg to shove her away.<br/>"BWWEEE!" Ryouga ran past the fighters in the<br/>direction Ryoko had come from, both ignored him.<br/>"I'm not going to kill some one that wants to die,"<br/>Nagi told Ryoko, quietly. "Even if that weren't the<br/>case, you're powers are gone, you're still injured,<br/>and you look sick. When I fight you it will be at<br/>your best. As you are now I haven't even used my<br/>weapon and I'm winning."<br/>"You'll fight me now," Ryoko said, standing up.<br/>"Or you won't ever get the chance again." She<br/>returned to battle stance and waited.<br/>"Oh, I think I can give you a reason to live," Nagi<br/>smiled. "You know it was really a shame that the<br/>Yagami got caught in my starburst." Ryoko's eyes<br/>widened and narrowed again. "It really was lucky that<br/>Washu managed to save the cabin, I didn't expect<br/>that."<br/>"You, you..." Ryoko gasped. "You're supposed to be<br/>after ME! I'M the one that escaped you, I'M your<br/>enemey!" Ryoko dropped to her knees. Nagi walked up<br/>and leaned down arrogantly.<br/>"Oh, don't worry, the girls, and I think Tenchi's<br/>father, survived. Ayeka didn't, of course, the<br/>starburst was close to the planet, and I understand a<br/>lot of the debris hit the palace, it looks almost as<br/>in good a shape as you do," Ryoko looked up and<br/>narrowed her eyes to slits, glaring at the bounty<br/>hunter. "Did you know that sweet little girl has<br/>placed a bounty on MY head."<br/>"I'm going to kill you," Ryoko said quietly.<br/>"Now that's more like the Ryoko I'm used to," Nagi<br/>said. "When I come back I expect you to be healthy,<br/>after all this time I deserve a great battle before<br/>you die."<br/>"Excuse me!" They turned to see Ranma standing<br/>there. "But you shouldn't bully the weak."<br/>"Another one of these Earth weaklings, Ryoko? You<br/>don't waste much time mourning do you?" Nagi asked<br/>laughing as she stood to face Ranma. She turned to<br/>face Ranma snapped an order. "Stay out of my way boy,<br/>this isn't your fight."<br/>"Ranma stay out of this, she's my problem!"<br/>"How many times do I have to keep explaining<br/>things?" Ranma demanded. "For the next week you're my<br/>responsibility, so your problems are my problems."<br/>"Are all you Earth boys so stubborn?" Ranma<br/>shrugged and a cautiously circled Nagi.<br/>"I am Ranma Saotome of the Anything Goes School of<br/>Martial Arts," Ranma said evenly. "And I ain't going<br/>to stand around and let nobody die."<br/>"Have it your way then," Nagi lashed out with her<br/>energy whip, and watched as Ranma seemed to blur<br/>around it.<br/>Nagi backpedalled in near-shock trying to get the<br/>martial artist back into the effective range of her<br/>whip. She caught a flash of red before leaning<br/>forward and reversing direction. Ranma was surprised<br/>as she ran past him, he hadn't expected that.<br/>"You're better than I thought," Nagi said in a low<br/>appreciative voice. Both fighters faced each other<br/>across the shrine's courtyard. Nagi took a closer<br/>look at Ranma.<br/>"I could be better," Ranma said, he certainly<br/>hadn't been good enough four years ago.<br/>"You're leaps and bounds ahead of Ryoko's last<br/>choice." Ryoko growled and lunged at Nagi.<br/>The bounty hunter intercepted the attack and turned<br/>it into a hold.<br/>"What are you doing idiot!" Ranma shouted. "You<br/>can't fight right now!"<br/>"She's mine!" Ryoko shrieked, despite the fact that<br/>Nagi currently had her under control.<br/>"Rest a little first, Ryoko," Nagi said. The<br/>bounty hunter's next move was to reach under Ryoko's<br/>blouse and tunic and rip out the stitches on her<br/>wound. Ryoko gritted her teeth at the pain as Nagi<br/>dropped her.<br/>"Damn it!" Ranma rushed forward and clapped a hand<br/>over the wound as Nagi made distance between them.<br/>Ryoko glared at her hatefully as she faded back into<br/>unconsciousness.<br/>"KEN-OHKI!"<br/>"Miao," Ken-Ohki answered hesitantly. As Ranma<br/>watched the white cabbit leaped into the air and<br/>transformed into a huge spiny space ship. Seeing the<br/>transformation kept thoughts of cats out of his head<br/>as the cabbit screeched in mid-transformation.<br/>"I'm counting on you to keep her alive until I come<br/>back, Saotome," Nagi shouted as she faded away,<br/>shortly before the cabbit-ship vanished into the sky.<br/>"Miao?" Ranma gritted his teeth and turned toward<br/>the worried-sounding cabbit.<br/>"Do you do that?" Ranma asked, nodding towards<br/>where Ken-Ohki had been. The cabbit nodded. "Do you<br/>remember where Dr. Tofu's is?" The cabbit nodded.<br/>"How about that black pig?" The cabbit looked<br/>confused, but nodded. "Okay, then get all of us to<br/>Dr. Tofu's!"<br/>"Miao!" Ryo-Ohki still didn't know what the big<br/>deal about that little pig was, but it had warned<br/>them, well Ranma anyway, about Nagi. Though Ryo-Ohki<br/>didn't understand how you could talk to a pig.<p>Dr. Tofu felt an immense feeling of deja vu as<br/>Ranma rushed into his clinic/house with an unconscious<br/>Ryoko for the second time that week. He was not,<br/>however totally unprepared. After Ranma said<br/>something about withdrawal they took Ryoko back into<br/>the clinic's examination room to again close the<br/>wound.<br/>Ranma, meanwhile, took the chance to revert Ryouga to<br/>his human form.<br/>"Okay, Ryouga, you heard more than I did," Ranma<br/>said as he dropped the pig into Kasumi and Tofu's<br/>furo. "Who was that?"<br/>"A bounty hunter, I think," Ryouga said. "You<br/>didn't say anything about Ryoko having a death wish."<br/>"Not your business," Ranma said, levelly. "What do<br/>you mean she's a bounty hunter?"<br/>"Your wife asked her if she was there for 'the<br/>bounty'," Ryouga said. "I don't think that's why she<br/>was there, though."<br/>"There's a bounty on Ryoko?" Ranma blinked.<br/>"Actually, that makes sense, she couldn't just be some<br/>magical race from Earth. She has to be a criminal<br/>from outerspace."<br/>"Huh?"<br/>"Nevermind, Where were you trying to go anyway?"<br/>"I think I was trying to find the closet," Ryouga<br/>said sheepishly. "Am I going to have to go around<br/>naked?"<br/>"No, you're going to be a pig until Ukyou gets here<br/>with some clothes," Ranma said. "How did you turn<br/>into a pig anyway?"<br/>"It started raining sake bottles," Ryouga said,<br/>embarrassed and irritated. Ranma sweatdropped.<br/>"Ahh...that's weird," Ranma said.<br/>"Ranma," Kasumi called. "Ukyou wants you to know<br/>that your mother is on the way." Ranma rolled his<br/>eyes and smacked his head. The last few days had had<br/>a lot more stress than he liked.<p>"Mom, I just met her a couple of days ago!" Ryouga<br/>sat still and watching the conversation. Ukyou hadn't<br/>shown up, but Nodoka had brought his clothes.<br/>Apparently his fiancee was running interference with<br/>the returned Amazons. This was a fact that they had<br/>not told Ranma about yet.<br/>"Then why did you marry her?"<br/>"It was an ACCIDENT! We were arguing, we got in<br/>the wrong line."<br/>"You certainly seem to have regained something of<br/>your way with women again," Nodoka said. "So what is<br/>my daughter-in-law like?"<br/>"This isn't going to last long," Ranma countered.<br/>"Four more days and its anulled."<br/>"There is such a thing as being TOO manly, Ranma"<br/>Nodoka lectured. "You shouldn't play games with<br/>marriage."<br/>"Might I have some attention please?" Dr Tofu<br/>called.<br/>"YES!" Ranma shouted in frustration. "How is she<br/>doc?"<br/>"Miao? Miao?" The cabbit cried piteously at the<br/>Doctor.<br/>"Yes, how is my daughter-in-law?" Dr. Tofu<br/>sweatdropped.<br/>"Well, I think she passed out mostly from a<br/>combination of factors than the wound itself," the<br/>doctor said. "Again, given time and rest, she should<br/>be fine. That doesn't appear to be happening."<br/>"This wasn't her fault Doc," Ranma said. "It was a<br/>blue-haired woman with some sort of Star Wars whip."<br/>"Ranma, why does this sort of thing always happen<br/>to you?" Nodoka asked.<br/>"I don't know?" Ranma sighed. He couldn't wait for<br/>this to get over with so he could get back in control<br/>of his life.<br/>"The withdrawal is more serious," Dr. Tofu said.<br/>"Or it would be if she weren't here."<br/>"Withdrawal? What kind of woman is this Ryoko?"<br/>"Mom, its not your business." Ranma said. Her<br/>mother arched an eyebrow.<br/>"Ranma, can I talk to you privately?" Dr. Tofu<br/>asked. Ranma shrugged, at least this set of questions<br/>would probably be less aggravting. Ranma and the<br/>Doctor left the lobby and entered the hallway. "Have<br/>you found anything out about her?" Ranma hesitated,<br/>these weren't his secrets to give, but he trusted Tofu<br/>to be discreet.<br/>"I don't think she was born on Earth. She started<br/>acting like Shampoo just to get some food. She is an<br/>annoying, irresponsible, drunkard, and...she...lost<br/>someone recently. You know, like me with Akane?"<br/>~Good thing you weren't as active as she is,~ Tofu<br/>thought to himself. Kasumi entered the hallway from<br/>the examination room and saw them.<br/>"She's awake," Kasumi said. "She seems to heal as<br/>fast as the rest of you."<br/>"Ranma, perhaps you should talk to her," Dr. Tofu<br/>suggested. "You're the only one that she's talked to<br/>at all."<br/>"Yeah, yeah," Ranma muttered. "You're not trying<br/>to set me up at all." He walked off to the<br/>examination room where he could already here Ryoko.<br/>"I don't want these herbs!" she shouted. "I want a<br/>DRINK! We have to be somewhere around a liquor store<br/>now! Oh, its YOU! What are you doing getting mixed<br/>up in MY fight?" Ranma growled in reaction to the<br/>familiar sensation of an insult match.<br/>"Hey, you want to take her, take her," Ranma said.<br/>"But not while you're in THIS condition."<br/>"THIS condition is your fault!" Ryoko snapped, also<br/>glad for the distraction of a good fight. She had<br/>missed Ayeka this last month. With Ranma it was<br/>almost like she had them both at...Ryoko smashed that<br/>thought.<br/>"As fun as this is," Ranma said, calming down. "We<br/>need to talk about that woman."<br/>"She won't come for me until she thinks I'm ready,"<br/>Ryoko said.<br/>"She's a bounty hunter," Ranma said.<br/>"Yeah, and I'm the only one to ever escape her,"<br/>Ryoko said. "She's been hunting me to exclusion since<br/>then."<br/>"Will she keep her word?" Ranma asked.<br/>"Yes," Ryoko said angrily.<br/>"Well that's lucky," Ranma said. "You can prepare<br/>to fight her over that time."<br/>"When I get my powers back," Ryoko growled.<br/>"You'll see a fight." Ranma paused a moment<br/>"That woman's the one that did it, right?" Ryoko<br/>narrowed her eyes, she knew what he was talking about.<br/>"She claims so," Ryoko said.<br/>"I'll give you some help if I can," Ranma said.<br/>"NIHAO!" Ranma froze.<br/>"I did not just hear that," Ranma sighed.<p>Back to Ryoko Saotome
