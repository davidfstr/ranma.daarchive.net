</div><br/>Ryoko Saotome<p>Mawwidge, that Bwessed Awwangement<p>Ryoko looked about the leaf-covered courtyard and<br/>hovered. She sat there looking about wistfully before<br/>landing, and letting gravity take hold again. Almost<br/>immediately she dropped to her knees, clutching her<br/>side. Ryo-Ohki jumped down from her shoulder and<br/>looked up at her in concern.<br/>Most of the minor injuries had faded to nothing<br/>already, but Ryoko hadn't given the hole in her side a<br/>chance to heal. She had even aggravated it to<br/>life-threatening levels in the battle. She would<br/>already be dead if Ryo-Ohki hadn't gotten her to a doc<br/>after she passed out.<br/>"Miao?"<br/>"Don't worry about it Ryo-Ohki," Ryoko growled.<br/>"Ryoko! Are you okay?" Ryoko whirled toward the<br/>voice before she realized it was just her imagination<br/>again. Then she slumped.<br/>"No, he's dead," Ryoko said quietly. "And I<br/>brought him to it."<br/>"Miao, MIAO!" She stared down at the lecturing<br/>cabbit, and then looked at her hand. There was blood<br/>there, but not much. She stood up a little<br/>unsteadily.<br/>"I'll be fine!" She snapped. "I don't need a<br/>doctor, especially not on THIS world." She had no<br/>qualms about letting herself die, not with Tenchi<br/>gone, but she had no intention of becoming a lab<br/>experiment either.<br/>"Miao?" The cabbit sounded desperate.<br/>"I have an idea for that," Ryoko said. "Can you<br/>hack some records to make me the owner of the land,<br/>shrine and house?"<br/>"Miao," Ryo-Ohki was nervous about this, Ryoko<br/>sounded suspiciously like she was tying up loose ends.<br/>"Miao?"<br/>"You know as well as I do!" Ryoko snapped.<br/>"Miao?"<br/>"I don't TRUST anybody else," Ryoko snapped. "How<br/>do I know his family wouldn't just sell it to some<br/>developer."<br/>"Miao?"<br/>"No, I don't want them to know I'm alive," Ryoko<br/>said. ~Might keep me from joining him.~ The cabbit<br/>phased out of site, probably taking space ship form so<br/>she could hack the Tokyo records. The cabbit returned<br/>a couple of minutes later.<br/>"Is it done?"<br/>"Miao, Miao!"<br/>"I have to SIGN something?" Ryoko repeated.<br/>"Miao."<br/>"They're going to be closed for a week after<br/>today?" Ryoko was off for the municipal offices.<br/>Ryo-Ohki was moderately worried that she was<br/>flying, but as long as she didn't teleport or<br/>something more energy consuming she should be all<br/>right. Plus the cabbit didn't think she'd risk<br/>herself before securing the shrine.<p>"Well, there he is," Soun said, looking down to his<br/>childish-looking wife. Hinako's child form had aged<br/>some at least, she looked about fourteen or so now.<br/>He pointed out the kneeling figure at Akane's<br/>tombstone, laying down flowers.<br/>Ranma stood and turned as he heard the approach of<br/>another person. He relaxed when saw Hinako and Soun.<br/>"Thought you were Kuno," Ranma said evenly.<br/>"That delinquent is STILL attempting to desecrate<br/>Akane's grave?" Hinako was furious.<br/>"No, he's trying to goad me into making a mistake,"<br/>Ranma explained.<br/>"We haven't seen you since Nabiki left for school,"<br/>Soun noted, changing the subject.<br/>"Did you get Ryouga and Ukyou's wedding<br/>invitation?" Ranma asked. He wondered briefly if the<br/>fact that neither of the two had followed him today<br/>had anything to do with Soun and Hinako's presence.<br/>"You'll see me there."<br/>"How's your education going, Saotome-san?" Hinako<br/>asked as he passed them. They knew the answer<br/>perfectly well.<br/>"I'm finished," he said, turning around. "I plan<br/>to sign for the license to teach today."<br/>"You'll need a dojo," Soun noted. Ranma's eyes<br/>narrowed dangerously.<br/>~He's NOT going to suggest that HERE!~ Ranma<br/>thought.<br/>"How would Akane feel about the dojo being empty?"<br/>"She wouldn't like it," Ranma agreed reluctantly.<br/>"I'll think about it, but this is the LAST place you<br/>should have EVER tried something like this!" Ranma<br/>snapped before leaving.<br/>"You made him angry," Hinako noted.<br/>"I did," Soun agreed.<br/>"That's a good sign."<p>~Why do I need ALL of this just to make sure that<br/>no one ever tears down the Shrine?~ Ryoko thought to<br/>herself. ~Ryo-ohki gave me an entire life history!~<br/>It had taken Ryoko forever to get the paperwork<br/>that Ryo-Ohki had faked for her. She didn't have much<br/>time before these offices closed and then it would be<br/>another week before she could come back to sign things<br/>again.<br/>~You've planned this, haven't you?~ Ryoko thought.<br/>~Damn walking carrot plague.~ Ryoko irritably sorted<br/>through the pile of papers the last clerk had handed<br/>her, trying to figure out which ones were pertinent to<br/>her task.<br/>Else where a similar scene was occuring.<br/>~I did NOT want all this stuff,~ Ranma growled to<br/>himself. ~All I wanted was my degree, transcripts and<br/>dan certifications.~ Ranma tried to find the<br/>documents in question in the sheaf of documents as he<br/>walked along.<br/>Ryoko and Ranma both looked up and towards the<br/>lines of people at nearly the same time. Though they<br/>were interrupted in identifying the proper lines by<br/>colliding with each other. Both of them were angry,<br/>Ryoko suffering from a fresh loss, and Ranma on the<br/>verge of venting four years of pent up emotions. They<br/>exploded.<br/>Ryoko snapped her mouth shut as she hit the ground<br/>amidst the shower of papers. She stood up quickly<br/>trying to avoid seeming awkward. Next to her, Ranma<br/>stood up much smoother, but no less angrier.<br/>"Watch where you're going asshole!" Ryoko shouted<br/>as she began randomly picking up papers.<br/>"You ran into me!" Ranma retorted as he picked up<br/>papers as well. He blinked when Ryoko's hand darted<br/>for her side as she reached for a paper. "Are you<br/>okay?"<br/>"I'm FINE!"<br/>"Excuse me for caring!"<br/>"You don't want to mess with me, punk," Ryoko<br/>snarled as she picked up the last paper she could find<br/>started sorting through them. "I'll take your head<br/>off."<br/>"Punk! Have you looked at your hair recently..."<br/>he looked at one of the papers in his hand. "Ryoko?"<br/>"Well...Ranma," They switched papers as they walked<br/>forward, not paying attention. "Your not one to talk<br/>with that girly little pig tail."<br/>"What did you say?"<br/>"You heard me fem-boy!" Tenchi had had a similar<br/>hair style, but Ryoko was feeling less than forgiving<br/>at the moment, and it seemed that she had struck a<br/>nerve somewhere.<br/>"May I have your documents, Ma'am?" Ryoko shoved<br/>her papers at the clerk, still glaring at Ranma.<br/>"Hey, at least I'm not dressed like some slut from<br/>a hentai manga."<br/>"You're papers sir," Ranma slapped his pile down.<br/>"You...You..."<br/>"What's the matter, can't keep up?" Ranma smirked,<br/>this argument had an oddly nostalgic quality about it.<br/>He wasn't about to admit to himself why though.<br/>"Keep up with a brainless, effeminate, weakling<br/>like you?" Ryoko snapped. "Why should I bother?"<br/>"Excuse me, I need your signatures," the clerk said<br/>nervously. Ranma and Ryoko both paused to get what<br/>ever it was the little man wanted out of the way so<br/>they could continue the fight.<br/>"I ain't no weakling, Ryoko!"<br/>"So, Ranma, you're just effeminate and brainless<br/>then?"<br/>"Here you go," they turned to glare at the clerk<br/>pushing their documents towards them in one stack.<br/>"What do you want!" They both snapped. Ranma<br/>picked up the stack of documents and was about to flip<br/>through them when he noticed what the top document<br/>said.<br/>"Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Saotome," the clerk<br/>said before shutting his window and making a mad dash<br/>for the time clock.<br/>"NANI!" Ranma and Ryoko looked up at the sign<br/>above the counter. "MARRIAGE CERTIFACATES!"<br/>"Hey," Ryoko smashed through the thin wooden cover.<br/>"Come back here! That little weasel is gone<br/>already!"<br/>"Great, just great," Ranma growled. "I thought I<br/>was finished with fiancees and marriages."<br/>"ACK! They're closed! I have to wait a week<br/>now!"<br/>"So do I!"<br/>"This is all YOUR fault," Ryoko declared. She held<br/>her hands in front of her to gather power.<br/>~Deja vu,~ Ranma thought bitterly. "Now there's<br/>something I haven't heard before." He stuffed the<br/>documents in his shirt and put his own hands forward<br/>ready to deflect a chi blast.<br/>Ranma's preprations ceased as Ryoko cried at and<br/>clutched her side. He looked at a play of what looked<br/>like chi power sparking from her side. The<br/>silver-haired woman crumpled to the ground, her tail<br/>twitched once (tail?) and then she seemed to pass out.<br/>"Ah shit," Ranma said as he noted the blood begin<br/>to pool around her side. In a blink of motion he<br/>swooped her up and was running out of the building.<br/>"Kasumi and Tofu's ain't that far away from here."<br/>"Just let me die." Ranma was about half-way to Dr.<br/>Tofu's when he heard those horribly familiar words.<br/>"Hey, I ain't letting no one else die, if I can<br/>help it," Ranma snapped.<br/>"No one else?" Ryoko repeated. ~Damn, I really<br/>ripped it open this time, good I'll see Tenchi soon.~<br/>"Who di.." She passed out again.<br/>"Damn it."<p>"Well that was interesting," Tofu said as he walked<br/>back to the front of his house where Ranma was<br/>waiting.<br/>"So how is she, Doc?" Ranma asked.<br/>"Ranma," Kasumi said as she entered the room after<br/>Tofu. "Were you aware that she is not human?"<br/>"Well, the tail was a clue," Ranma said. "But I<br/>just met her today, so I didn't have much chance."<br/>"Just met her today?" Tofu repeated, arching an<br/>eyebrow. He was surprised, elated really to see Ranma<br/>behaving more like his old self. He was angry, yes,<br/>but he wasn't cold any more.<br/>"Yeah, so." Kasumi produced the marriage license.<br/>"Oh, that. We were sort of fighting and didn't notice<br/>what line we were in."<br/>"I see," Kasumi said. "This does sound like<br/>something that would happen to you."<br/>"Yeah, so how is she?"<br/>"She's going to live," Tofu told him. "It took me<br/>a little while to find some equivilent shiatsu points<br/>on her, though. So she lost a lot of blood, I'd<br/>suggest you take her to a hospital, if I thought she'd<br/>come out again."<br/>"You mean the thing about her not being human?"<br/>Ranma asked. "You don't believe that alien autopsy<br/>crap do you?"<br/>"Ranma, watch your language," Kasumi blinked. She<br/>hadn't heard Ranma curse since his return from China.<br/>"That is a concern though, yes," Tofu confirmed.<br/>"What can you tell me about the wound?"<br/>"She already had it," Ranma said. "She was<br/>summoning a chi blast when it sort of short circuted<br/>or something."<br/>"Hmm, I wonder if I can apply a chi block to her,"<br/>Tofu thought. "Keep her from further aggravating the<br/>wound. That sleeping point I found on her should last<br/>a little longer."<br/>"Miao?" Ranma leaped onto a table, as the other two<br/>turned toward the worried sound.<br/>"Oh my, where did that come from," Kasumi asked.<br/>Ranma looked to the little rabbit-like thing and<br/>cautiously came down from the table.<br/>"That's not a cat...is it?"<br/>"It doesn't appear to be," Dr. Tofu said. "I<br/>wonder if this perhaps connected to your mistaken<br/>wife."<br/>"Miao?"<br/>"He means, Ryoko," Ranma said nervously from the<br/>other side of the table.<br/>"Miao?"<br/>"Do you understand us?" Kasumi asked. The little<br/>rabbit creature nodded. "Don't worry Ranma, this is<br/>not a cat."<br/>"You're sure?" Ranma asked. Moving nervously back<br/>around the table.<br/>"Yes," Kasumi said soothingly. "Tofu, dear,<br/>perhaps you should tend to that chi block you were<br/>discussing." Tofu glanced at his wife, noted her<br/>expression, and nodded. As the doctor moved to return<br/>to the still unconscious Ryoko she turned to face<br/>Ranma.<br/>"Well, that isn't a cat," Ranma agreed sitting down<br/>still eyeing the cabbit, which was looking at him<br/>curiously.<br/>~No one has been afraid of me like this before.~<br/>"You seem better than you have been," Kasumi<br/>started. "Its been a long while since anything beyond<br/>a real cat has gotten a reaction from you."<br/>"Mr Tendo was at Akane's grave today to ask me<br/>about running the dojo," he said.<br/>"I know," Kasumi said. "I suggested it."<br/>"NANI!"<br/>"Well I suggested that they make you angry," Kasumi<br/>said. "Everybody else came up with the details.<br/>"Why the hell would you WANT me angry?" Ranma<br/>demanded.<br/>"Because it is better than cold," Kasumi noted.<br/>"And you are acting more like your normal self at<br/>last. And please watch your language."<br/>"Sorry Kasumi," Ranma said.<br/>"Now why are you so interested in this woman,"<br/>Ranma opened his mouth. "And don't tell me you<br/>aren't, I know you to well for that."<br/>"She told me to just let her die," Ranma muttered.<br/>"And I rememebered saying something like that to<br/>Ukyou."<br/>"Hmmm, I see," she turned to the cabbit. "Does she<br/>have any friends to look after her?" The cabbit shook<br/>its head after a moment. "Yes, but not in the area<br/>then?"<br/>"Miao," the cabbit nodded.<br/>"This seems to be a fortunate meeting then," Kasumi<br/>said. "You won't be able to anull this wedding for<br/>another week, correct?"<br/>"Again, Yeah, so?"<br/>"Then you are honorbound to look after her at least<br/>until you anull the wedding, then," Kasumi said.<br/>"I guess so," Ranma shrugged, not sure he liked<br/>where this was going.<br/>"Then do so," Kasumi spoke softly, but it still<br/>held the note of command. "It might do you both some<br/>good."<p>Ryoko sat up and looked around and then dropped<br/>back to the bed.<br/>"Still alive," she sighed, before sitting up again.<br/>~I can't leave yet anyway.~<br/>"Yep, Tofu patched you up." Ryoko turned toward<br/>the voice and growled.<br/>"Oh...YOU," she said, disgusted. "What are you<br/>doing here."<br/>"Somebody has to make sure you stay alive," Ranma<br/>said. "Apparently that falls to me." He didn't<br/>mention that Tofu and Kasumi had virtually commanded<br/>him to watch her while they "talked" to the<br/>rabbit-thing. ~How do you talk to a rabbit?~ Of<br/>course he had seen stranger things before.<br/>"I'm not your problem," Ryoko snapped. She stood<br/>up and leaned forward. Ryoko's eyes goggled as she<br/>failed to float off the ground. She teetered for a<br/>moment in off balance confusion before falling<br/>forward, and being caught by Ranma. ~Damn he's fast.~<br/>"Oh yeah, the Doc blocked your chi," Ranma said as<br/>he set Ryoko back on her feet.<br/>"Blocked my what?" Ryoko took a moment to try to<br/>summon a force shield, then a short teleport, and<br/>finally her energy sword. Nothing happened. "You<br/>JERK, what did you do that for?" Ryoko lashed out at<br/>Ranma and was surprised when he caught the fist.<br/>~Damn, she's strong,~ Ranma noted to himself.<br/>~Maybe Doc should have given her the strength sapping<br/>moxibustion too.~<br/>"How'd you do that?" Ryoko growled, pulling back<br/>and looking at the young man. He just shrugged.<br/>Ryoko narrowed her eyes and snapped up a foot, which<br/>Ranma blocked. True to Ranma's history with women,<br/>the distraction proved enough for Ryoko send him<br/>flying against the wall.<br/>Ranma shrugged in frustration as the silver-haired<br/>woman turned and left the room. Ryoko cursed as she<br/>ran into the door, forgetting she had to open it. He<br/>shook his head clear before standing up and following.<br/>"What kind of sense does this make," Ranma<br/>muttered.<br/>"Oh, you're awake," Kasumi said as Ryoko walked<br/>into the front room. Ryoko froze at the sound of the<br/>voice. There was a familiar hint of unconditional<br/>kindness in the voice.<br/>"Sas.." then she sighed, turning around. "No, too<br/>old." She turned to face the serenly smiling visage<br/>of a young woman maybe twenty-three years old.<br/>"I'm sorry, did I remind you of...someone?"<br/>"Are you the doctor?" Ryoko ignored the question.<br/>"Oh my, no," Kasumi said surprised. "Not yet at<br/>any rate. That would be my husband."<br/>"You woke up faster than I thought," another voice<br/>said behind her. Another man walked around into her<br/>view, paying close attention to her wound, bandaged<br/>again, and how she was holding herself.<br/>~Definitely a doctor,~ she thought. Then she<br/>caught sight of Ryo-Ohki sitting on a chair, watching<br/>her cautiously. She fixxed the cabbit with a glare<br/>that left Ryo-Ohki little doubt that she suspected her<br/>of causing today's delay. "How long until I get my<br/>powers back?"<br/>"Well I can reverse it, but I don't know when or if<br/>they'll come back naturally," Tofu answered. "Your<br/>physiology is a little different."<br/>"Hey, maybe you should give her the<br/>strength-sapping moxibustion too," Ranma suggested as<br/>he joined them. "She's strong, maybe as strong as<br/>Ryouga."<br/>"If you try it, I'll kill you," Ryoko promised.<br/>"So I guess the only way I'm getting my powers back is<br/>when you decide to give them to me. Fine, I won't<br/>need them anyway. Ryo-Ohki, let's go home."<br/>"Miao, miao." Ryoko blinked.<br/>"NANI!" Ryoko shouted angrily. She looked back<br/>and saw Ranma's head poking into the room from deeper<br/>in the building. She didn't care much why he had<br/>suddenly retreated into the hallway, but turned back<br/>to Ryo-Ohki. "Wait for him?"<br/>"Forgot about that thing," Ranma muttered, inching<br/>back into the room, he looked up at the phrase "Wait<br/>for him."<br/>"Oh yes," Kasumi said. "We thought maybe Ranma<br/>should accompany you home." Ranma narrowed his eyes,<br/>there had to be more to this.<br/>"I can take care of myself," Ryoko argued.<br/>"I'm sure you can," Tofu agreed. "But if the<br/>injury were to somehow open again having him on hand<br/>would be a good idea." Which Ryoko correctly took to<br/>mean they wanted to make she didn't do anything that<br/>would get her killed.<br/>"What haven't you said yet?"<br/>"Well, we gather from this wonderful little<br/>creature," Kasumi indicated a preening Ryo-Ohki.<br/>"That Ryoko lives outside of town, she shouldn't be on<br/>her own with a wound like that."<br/>"Oh HELL no!" Ranma shouted.<br/>"There's no way I'm showing him where I live."<br/>"Miao," Ryoko glared at the cheerful cabbit. Of<br/>course Ryo-Ohki could lead him there.<br/>"Why should I go live with her for a week?"<br/>"It'll make it easier to get the marriage anulled<br/>for one thing," Tofu said. "Plus I imagine you could<br/>use some time to think things over."<br/>~Great, we get to babysit each other,~ Ranma<br/>sighed. "We don't have a choice here, do we?"<br/>"I do NOT need to be babysat!" Ryoko shouted.<br/>"Miao?" Ryoko ignored the cabbit.<br/>"It's only a week," Kasumi said sweetly.<br/>"I'll need to tell Ukyou and Ryouga," Ranma said<br/>irritably. "I think he still has my camping gear<br/>anyway." After a futile argument with Ryo-Ohki, Ryoko<br/>gave up with a frustrated growl.<br/>"A week with you, this'll be just great," Ryoko<br/>muttered.<p>"Think it worked?" Ryouga asked as he finished up<br/>the tables. He had washed each table at least three<br/>times, mostly because he kept coming back to one table<br/>or another.<br/>"I hope so," Ukyou said. "Babysitting him is<br/>getting...frustrating. He cares less now than when he<br/>finally woke up."<br/>"He isn't trying to kill himself," Ryouga noted.<br/>"He doesn't really need to be watched."<br/>"Yeah, he just doesn't care if he lives," Ukyou<br/>said, quietly. Ryouga turned to face her, well tried<br/>to, he found her on the third try.<br/>"Ucchan, you tried," Ukyou turned an exasperated<br/>glare at him. "It didn't work."<br/>"Don't get jealous P-chan," Ukyou said, half<br/>teasing. "I just wish he'd..."<br/>"...show up?"<br/>"I can walk on my own!" Ryouga and Ukyou looked in<br/>the direction of the shout for a moment and then<br/>shrugged.<br/>"That's why you trip ever thirty feet," somebody<br/>shouted back.<br/>"Ranma?" Ryouga and Ukyou blinked.<br/>"I'm used to walking THROUGH obstacles, not around<br/>them!"<br/>"Owww! What did you do that for?" Ryouga and Ukyou<br/>had their attention riveted on the front of Ucchan's<br/>when a silver-haired woman with what looked like a<br/>rabbit on her shoulder walked in looking upset. She<br/>walked rather stiffly and irritably into the<br/>restaurant.<br/>"This is Ucchan's right?"<br/>"Uh...we're closed," Ryouga said, confused.<br/>"Its alright, Ryouga, she's with me," they looked<br/>to Ranma coming in rubbing his head.<br/>"Uh, Ranma," Ukyou started. "Who's this."<br/>"A pain in the neck," he mumbled. "Its a long<br/>story, just leave it at I'm supposed to make sure she<br/>takes it easy for the next week or so." Ryoko mumbled<br/>something as she turned toward a booth.<br/>"Sit at the counter," Ukyou suggested. "I can keep<br/>us all fed that way."<br/>"Thanks Ukyou," Ranma said as he sat down on a<br/>stool.<br/>"Miao?" Ryoko sighed as she sat down at the<br/>counter, stiffly. This patch wasn't quite as complete<br/>as when she had unexpectedly woken up after the<br/>battle. Ryoko had expected to die then, but as soon<br/>as she'd passed out Ryo-Ohki was off to a doctor<br/>they'd used before.<br/>"Do you have any carrots?"<br/>"Sure, how many do you need?"<br/>"As many as you can get," Ryoko said simply. Ukyou<br/>blinked.<br/>"So what's the long story?" Ukyou asked.<br/>"Hey, what's this?" Ryouga asked leaning down to<br/>pick up a crumpled piece of paper he had seen fall out<br/>of Ranma's shirt. "YOU GOT MARRIED?" Ranma's head<br/>dropped to the counter while Ryoko growled.<br/>"IT DOESN'T COUNT!" Ryoko yelled.<br/>"Just burn the damn thing," Ranma whined, head<br/>still on the counter.<br/>"I'm beginning to get the picture," Ukyou said.<p>"You're making this too easy, Ryoko," Nagi said as<br/>she walked out of the spaceport.<p>"Xian Pu," the named Amazon looked up from her<br/>kata. "There has been some news."<br/>"News, great grandmother?"<br/>"Yes, apparently Ranma was not as hopeless as we<br/>had thought," she said. "I've heard that he's been<br/>mostly active the past three years at, least."<br/>"But I'm already married," Xian Pu reminded her.<br/>"Even if he is better, its too late now."<br/>"True, but didn't he also beat your sister's in<br/>battle as well," Kuh Lon asked. "And Ran Ran has not<br/>found a husband since then."<br/>"That's true," Xian Pu agreed. "Where did you<br/>learn of this, Great-grandmother? The spatula-girl's<br/>invitation said nothing of this."<br/>"The Kumon boy brought the information," Kuh Lon<br/>said. "I suspect he's just trying to make trouble for<br/>Ranma without actually having to fight him. Though<br/>there is little concern for his motives."<br/>"It doesn't matter, I guess," Xian Pu shrugged.<br/>"Why tell me and not talk to Ran-Ran?"<br/>"I want you to go with her to Japan," Kuh Lon said.<br/>"You and Mousse could visit old friends and you can<br/>get some practice with certain duties of a matriarch."<br/>"Like matchmaking?" Xian Pu asked.<br/>"Among other things," Kuh Lon agreed. "I'd suggest<br/>going on the excuse of the Kuonji girl's marriage to<br/>Ryouga. And re-open the Nekohanten as well, perhaps<br/>even for a more permanent stay."<br/>"Great-grandmother?"<br/>"Perhaps it is time for our people to move out into<br/>the world," Kuh Lon said. "And Nerima would be a good<br/>place to start. Keep a tight rein on Ran Ran, the<br/>primary goal is getting a foothold in the world,<br/>pushing Ranma could endanger that." Xian Pu thought<br/>of the battle with Saffron and nodded.<p>Back to Ryoko Saotome
