</div><br/>TitleRyoko Saotome/Title<p>Planning the Second Honeymoon<p>Breakfast was quite subdued as Ranma and Ryoko picked at their food, both preoccupied with other things. Nodoka watched them with a slight frown on her face.<br/>"Is something wrong?" Genma asked. He sounded on the verge of overjoyed with the prospect that it was. Nodoka didn't bother to glare at him, and instead paid careful attention to the couple in question. Ranma and Ryoko froze a moment and glanced at each other, and Nodoka saw the decision formed between them.<br/>"Nothin'" Ranma answered firmly. Ryoko's response was slightly more colorful.<br/>"Keep your fat ass out of our business."<br/>"The city offices were destroyed yesterday, dear," Nodoka put in calmly, smiling as she did so. They were presenting a united front yet again. Her worries that something had gone wrong last night were rendered moot.<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said. Then he blinked. "Yeah! That's it." Ryoko gave him a strange look for a moment and then caught on herself.<br/>"What!" Genma demanded. "It was destroyed?"<br/>"That's right," she agreed. "That pervert showed up and we had to bring the house down on him."<br/>"But how will they anull the marriage then?"<br/>"It'll just have to wait," Ryoko said. "Shouldn't take more than a month, right?"<br/>"That sounds right," Ranma said. "The construction companies have been out of practice for a while now."<br/>"And you say nothing's wrong?" Genma demanded, wondering why he seemed to be the most upset about this.<br/>"Stuff it, pop," Ranma said shaking his head. "I got to go check with Ukyou and Ryouga. I'm supposed to be helpin' them with the weddin' you know." He flinched and turned to look at Ryoko with a surprised expression, until she shifted her eyes in Nodoka's expression.<br/>"That's a wonderful idea," Nodoka said cheerfully. "I'm glad you are so interested in weddings." Ranma groaned and looked at Ryoko's "you see'" expression.<p>********<p>Ryoko glanced over at Ranma as she floated along. That was one thing different between Ranma and Tenchi. Tenchi would have thrown a fit if she had been displaying her powers in public. She was never really certain just why he did so either. That, however was the least of her thoughts at the moment.<br/>~Why did he hope I'd come back?~ Ryoko asked herself. ~Why did he kiss me when he was a cat? Why didn't he insist we go to the offices right away on the first day?~ Her thoughts paused for a long moment. ~Why didn't I? And why did I kiss him?~ Usually questions were easy to answer. She wanted something, so she took it, simple as that. For the first time Ryoko could remember, however, she really wasn't certain of just what she wanted.<br/>Ranma was similarly distracted.<br/>~I kissed back,~ he thought. ~Didn't I? Why did I do that? Is she mad about that? Why did she kiss me anyway, What about the first day we knew the city building was open.~ It was nerve racking series of questions, but at least he had experienced this second guessing before. And he was familiar with the consequences for letting such indecision run.<p>********<p>There the villain was, dragging his new victim along by means of some insidious spell that left her trapped in mid-air. He could tell by the expression upon the exotic woman's face that the sorcerer must have already attempted some vile deeds while she was under his dubious power.<br/>Kuno feared that it must be growing too late to save the poor women from Akane's fate. Locked in an enchanted slumber, her family believing she was actually dead. Yet, when he defeated this foul demon-summoner certainly all the spells he had cast would be undone.<br/>Kuno, the Bandaged Blunder, limped forward towards the pair.<p>********<p>Ran Ran settled herself in a tree, watching the approaching pair like a hawk. She played with a small globe in her hand, smirking at the simple and foolproof nature of her plan. All she had to do was get Ranma away from that sorceress long enough for him to see that it was time he finally obeyed Amazon law.<br/>Really, that Pepe Le Pu was such a genius at these things. It seemed he always managed to catch his girl. So maybe following the little stinky cat's ways, she could catch her man.<br/>Ran Ran was getting desparate.<p>********<p>"We should talk," Ryoko said out of the blue. "About what happens...while the offices are being rebuilt."<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said agreeably. "We should talk." It was clear from his voice that he probably didn't agree with the subject matter though.<br/>"I could just come back when the place is ready," Ryoko suggested. "I'm not sick or injured anymore."<br/>Before Ranma could answer a small globe struck in front of them and exploded in a thick, evil smelling cloud. The greenish vapor expanded quickly to envelope them in mere moments. The air was rent with cries of "Die foul Sorcerer" as a short scuffle broke out in the cloud. The scuffle ended quickly and as the cloud faded away two figures could be seen lying prostrate upon the ground.<br/>Ran Ran, wearing a thick scarf around her nose and mouth lay on her back and stared up sort of dazedly, spotting a huge bump on her head. Next to her was what seemed to be a green mummy with "stomach" problems.<br/>Apparently Kuno's bandages didn't keep all the stench out.<br/>"What is this?" Kuno demanded shakily, trying to keep the contents of stomach down. "The sorcerer has fled and left behind this child to appease my wrath? Of course, he must have known I was coming. It would account for his panicking and error. And now he has released one of what is probably many hostages. Certainly I can not be too far from destroying him!"<br/>Kuno limped off, leaving a Ran Ran behind despite the fact that the poor girl had apparently been knocked unconscious by a blow to the head and was wearing a sling. Ran Ran didn't wake up for several minutes. When she did, she was positively beaming.<br/>"He defeat me," she said proudly. "He know what that means, I win!" She stood up, feeling a little nauseous herself from the head blow, and shuffled out after where she hoped they had left to.<p>********<p>"What was that?" Ryoko asked distastefully.<br/>"That was Kuno and someone else," Ranma said.<br/>"That girl?" Ryoko asked suspiciously.<br/>"Probably," Ranma answered frowning.<br/>"What is it with her anyway?" Ryoko demanded irritably.<br/>"Amazon law," Ranma said, before explaining the Amazon Outsider policies.<br/>"That has got to be the most bizarre story I have ever heard," Ryoko said simply.<br/>"Getting accidentally married to someone you just met?" Ranma noted sagely.<br/>"That is the most bizarre story I have lived," Ryoko corrected him. "Who is Kuno?"<br/>"An lunatic," Ranma said. He paused for a moment before walking down the street towards Ucchan's again. "So you want to leave?"<br/>"That's what you want, right?" Ryoko asked sharply.<br/>"No," Ranma answered. Ryoko stared at him for a moment.<br/>"You don't want me to leave?" she said, half disbelieving. "Are you certain you didn't eat something questionable?"<br/>"Not that I know of," Ranma said, though the random love potion was always a cause for concern in Nerima.<br/>"That's a ringing endorsement," Ryoko said smirking.<br/>"Trust me on this one," Ranma said as they neared Ucchan's door. "Love potions leave you a lot less confused than the real thing does." That statement stopped Ryoko's sarcasm cold.<p>********<p>It had been a full day and no sign of Ryouga yet. Ukyou was hardly surprised, but she was hopeful. Recently Ryouga had been getting back from being lost fairly promptly. She had gotten used to this while they were dating, and while they were living together. As soon as they got married she expected that it would go right back to the level of occasional annoyance. The problem was that if this kept up she didn't see how she'd get to the wedding, much less past it.<br/>She looked up as the bell rang and was surprised to see those friends of Ryoko's.<br/>"Hello," she said cheerily. "How are you two today."<br/>"Oh, we're fine!" the blonde said lightly. "Headquarters promoted us!"<br/>"That's good news I guess," Ukyou said, noting that green-haired woman thought it was anything but.<br/>"We're now first class Inspectors assigned to the Sol system," she said with a "whoop-te-do" tone of voice.<br/>"We're now the ranking officers in the area!" Mihoshi added.<br/>"You're the only two officers in the area, right?" Ukyou asked. Kiyone nodded irritably, though Ukyou suspected that the irritation and bitterness were mostly a habit rather than anything serious.<br/>"Have you seen Ryoko?" Kiyone asked. "I have some news for her." That remark cooled the blonde's good humor some, and it certainly seemed that neither of them wanted to broach the subject.<br/>"She's right outside the door," Ukyou said cautiously. Kiyone and Mihoshi turned around and the green-haired woman took a deep breath.<br/>"Well here goes nothing," she muttered.<br/>"Should I fear for my restaurant?" Ukyou asked the blonde.<p>********<p>"What did you mean by that?" Ryoko asked cautiously.<br/>"What?" Ranma asked, giving an appearance of cluelessness.<br/>"Did you just say that..." she paused. "You couldn't have meant that." Ranma debated with himself for a moment before answering. Waiting, keeping silent. That didn't work, it only wasted time, even if he wasn't certain.<br/>Then the door opened next to them.<br/>"Ryoko," Kiyone said. She locked at the somewhat frustrated expressions and frowned a little more. "Sorry to interrupt."<br/>"Interrupt what?" Ryoko asked sharply, drawing a look from Ranma.<br/>"There's some news," Kiyone said grimmly. Ryoko's attention was suddenly focused on her.<br/>"What kind of news," she asked.<br/>"Let's go inside," Kiyone said, "Get some privacy." Ryoko nodded and set her feet down on the floor.<br/>~Bad news,~ Ranma thought, perfectly aware that Ryoko was thinking similar things. As they walked in he waved to Ukyou and noted the haggard expression on her face. "He's lost again?"<br/>"He went out to beat on Happosai and hasn't been seen since," Ukyou said through gritted teeth. Ranma rolled his eyes and shook his head.<br/>"Ranma," Ryoko said firmly. "Are you coming or not?" Ukyou smirked as Ranma rolled his eyes again and followed his accidental wife to a booth.<br/>The smirk quickly faded as she regarded the expressions on the four faces. She frowned herself before picking up her business smile and carrying over an order of Okonomiyaki's to the table.<br/>"So what's the news?" Ryoko asked.<br/>"There is some good news," Kiyone said. "Ayeka pulled out her coma. For a little while at least."<br/>"Coma?" Ryoko said. "I thought she was dead."<br/>"I thought so to," Kiyone said, not bothering to mention that this news was about five days old. "But maybe there's still a chance after all."<br/>"She's alive," Ryoko said, wonderingly staring at the table in front of her.<br/>"What's the bad news," Ranma asked. Ryoko's attention focused on Kiyone again.<br/>"They lost the convoy moving Nagi," Kiyone said grimmly.<br/>"She escaped," Ryoko said.<br/>"There could have been an accident," Mihoshi pointed out. "They were supposed to be travelling quiet."<br/>"Oh please," Ryoko snapped back. "An accident killing her?"<br/>"Don't go chasing her, Ryoko," Mihoshi pleaded. Ryoko turned toward the blonde with an angry expression but caught Ranma's concerned, if quiet expression as well.<br/>"I don't have to, do I?" Ryoko said. "She'll come for me." She stayed quiet for a moment, brooding over the situation. Some part of her was glad for the chance to get her vengeance on the bounty hunter, for she surely would get that chance now. "Have you heard what Ayeka's chances are?"<br/>"I don't know," Kiyone said. "And I don't know how much she'll remember, either."<br/>Ryoko looked to Ranma and considred the talk they were trying to have on the way here. She no longer was certain what she should do. She would have talked to Yosho about this, but he was dead. Besides, there was really only one other person that she could reasonably hope would understand the situation. Aside from Ranma, and she wasn't sure she could talk to him about this yet. Not until she was certain.<br/>"I need to see her," Ryoko said, still looking at Ranma.<br/>"I don't see how that's a problem," Ukyou said suddenly. "It isn't like Ryouga's going to need his best man if he's not around. A trip would be good for you, and I'm certain your mother wouldn't mind."<br/>"And you do need to testify about those slavers," Mihoshi noted. Ranma and Ryoko frowned at that.<br/>"That would mean we would have to take-"<br/>"What is beauty that lies before eyes?" a young voice said stiffly, as if trying repeat something she heard. "Sha...Share...umm...CERTAIN you must be...uh...must be..." All eyes turned to Ran Ran as she struggled to recite her speech in a bad French accent.<br/>"What did I tell ya before?" Ranma asked as she continued. Ran Ran blanched and snapped her mouth shut.<br/>"But you defeat me!" she said in protest. Ranma frowned and tapped his fingers, glaring at Ran Ran until she backed down. The young Amazon settled for sticking her tongue out at Ryoko.<br/>"We can take her in our ship," Kiyone suggested. This actually going a lot easier than she thought it would. She didn't even have to mention that Sasami had virtually demanded she bring Ryoko to Jurai. "Come on Mihoshi, we have to talk to her sister again."<br/>"She's the one that went crazy last time, right?" Mihoshi asked as they stood up and grabbed the girl.<br/>"Where you taking me?" Ran Ran demanded.<br/>"Just let me do the talking this time," Kiyone said in an exasperated tone.<br/>"I guess that's settled," Ukyou said watching them go. She gave Ranma and Ryoko a knowing smile before she left to attend to some new customers coming in.<br/>"You don't have to go," Ryoko said. "They don't really need a testimony that says, 'I don't remember anything because I was a cat at the time.'"<br/>"Nah," Ranma said. "But I need to go anyway." Ryoko smiled faintly and nodded, looking down at the table.<br/>"After we sparred," Ryoko said. "Why didn't you insist we leave right away?"<br/>"Why didn't you?" Ranma said. "You knew they were open too."<br/>"I..." Ryoko sighed. "I don't know."<br/>"Neither do I," Ranma said. He paused for a moment and took a deep breath. "But I can tell you I've felt a lot better recently than I have for a long time." Ryoko glanced at him in surprise.<br/>"You did mean what you said," she whispered, shaking her head. ~I was never confused about Tenchi. I never wondered if it was right.~ Ranma had been mourning his Akane for four years, he had a right to start again. But Tenchi had only been dead a few months, was she just that callous? Life used to be simple. See what you want and take it. Why couldn't it just stay that simple?<br/>"Yeah," Ranma said. "I guess I meant it."<p>********<p>Sasami was half asleep, sitting next to her sister. Ayeka was no longer in one of Washu's rejuvenation tanks, lying instead on a hospital bed that was much more traditional in its design. Her hair was just started to grow back, and she looked deathly thin despite the IV solution essentially feeding her. Her vitals, however, were steady if weak.<br/>The younger princess had grown used to the constant beeps and noises that told her that her sister was still alive, even if she only barely held onto that life. Any fluctuation in that rythym galvanized her. So when Ayeka drew a thin, gasping breath, she was instantly alert.<br/>"Onechan!" Sasami gasped, seeing that Ayeka's eyes were open. A nurse noted the movement and called over a doctor before heading for the room herself.<br/>"Sasami?" Ayeka whispered weakly. "My head hurts..."<br/>"It's okay," Sasami said, crying for joy. "Washu put you back together all fine."<br/>"Washu?" Ayeka responded. "She's a legend...have to find Tenchi...they left her awake in there...going insane." She began to sit up, but Sasami gently pushed her back down in the bed.<br/>"Ayeka," Sasami said. "Everything will be fine, just rest. We'll take care of everything." She was still crying, afraid of what Ayeka would do when she learned that Tenchi was dead.<br/>"I feel heavy," Ayeka said, contrary to her thin appearance. "Tell Tenchi, she's going insane...they left her awake in the cryotube." Ayeka's voice faded into deep steady breathing as her eyes closed. As she returned to unconsciousness this time, the shallow breathing of her coma was not present, and the Crown Princess slept a natural sleep.<p>Back to Ryoko Saotome
