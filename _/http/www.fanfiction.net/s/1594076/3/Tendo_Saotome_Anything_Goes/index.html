</div><p>CHAPTER THREE: Poison</p><p>"Apparently, he still didn't get your meaning," Nabiki said  dryly the next morning, handing Ranma a small slip of paper.</p><p>"Hm?  What is it,  Ranma-chan?" Kasumi inquired.</p><p>"For Ranma Saotome," Ranma read casually.  "Whee, I've an enemy."  Joi sniffed curiously at the piece of paper  in Ranma's hands, then backed away, sneezing.   It was scented with some kind of rose perfume, Ranma decided.</p><p>"Ranma, don't take the upperclassman so lightly.  He got in a couple of punches last time, and  now he knows how you fight."  Akane was  crossing her arms over her chest, that infuriatingly stubborn look on her face.</p><p>"I was distracted, the last time," Ranma countered, crossing  her arms over her chest in unconscious parody.</p><p>"Right you were," Akane replied, agreeing.  "And you might be again.  Just be on your guard!"</p><p>"I will, I will," Ranma hissed.  "Geez!"</p><p>Nabiki bit into a small pastry.  "You two do stuff the oddest ways," she commented lazily.  "Hey Kasumi.  Is this how it sounded to you?"   Nabiki put on a lighter, more feminine voice, mimicking Akane.  " 'Ranma, the last time Kuno almost hurt  you.  It had me worried.'"  Her voice dropped, and she used male speech,  mimicking Ranma.  " 'Yes, Akane—I was  worried, too… about <i>you</i>.'"</p><p>"My goodness, Nabiki," Kasumi offered, putting one hand to  her lips.  "Did you have to be so…  accurate?"  The two sisters giggled as  Akane and Ranma blushed.</p><p>"Waaah!" Soun exclaimed.   "My little girl is worried over her… her…"</p><p>"Well, I <i>am</i> worried!" Akane said, seeing as how  admitting this would be the only way to stop her father from attempting to  complete that sentence.  "Just be  careful."</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "Yeah—okay, Akane.  I promise."</p><p>Akane's smile could have lit the room.  Despite Nabiki's teasing, the middle girl's  eyes widened, then traveled from Akane's obvious happiness to Ranma's just as  obvious accepting blush.  She blinked,  wondering if she was simply imagining something that wasn't there.</p><p>Ranma strode to the appointed place, her hair bound tightly  behind her, her clothing secure and unhindering, Joi nervously following.  <i>Will he rush me</i>? she wondered staring  out at Kuno, who looked as ready as she and twice as grim.  Then she noticed something that made her  start.  First of all, Kuno was hiding  something behind his back; second of all, his bokken was missing.</p><p>An only mildly observant person would have made the  seemingly obvious connection, but Ranma noticed the way Kuno was holding  himself.  If Kuno were holding his blade  she would be able to see its tip behind him and to his left.  She could not.</p><p>"Decided to leave your sword out of the picture today?" she  inquired archly.  Her hands were placed  on her hips.</p><p>"Sometimes more of a hindrance than a help," he replied  gravely.  He moved his arms in front of  him slowly.</p><p>"I'm ready," Ranma announced, sliding her left leg back and  giving him a cold stare.</p><p>When Kuno brought his hands forward, it was to place them in  front of his body, palms up, offering something to Ranma.  For a moment, her eyes couldn't figure out  what it was.  She blinked several times,  running her finger on the broken edge of the wood resting on his upturned  palms.  A drop of blood beaded on her  finger.  With a small gasp, she pulled  her hand to her chest, seeking to protect the wound.</p><p>"You have me," he said simply.</p><p>The two broken pieces of bokken fell to the dirt with a  small clatter at the redhead's feet.</p><p>"I always went easy on Tendo Akane," he added, his voice  slightly urgent as though it was important she know this.  "Until that one day I must have angered her  beyond reason.  I knew she was not as  good as I—I always knew.  And yet, when  the time came that I truly needed to protect myself, I stretched my skills  above her to find that nothing was there."</p><p>Ranma blinked at him.   "H-hey, you don't need to tell me—"</p><p>The young man continued obliviously.  "She had gotten better, of course, while I  had maintained myself at precisely the same level as before.  A foolish mistake, not worthy of the Great…  of me."  His eyes finally met Ranma's.</p><p>"I managed to do it again," he replied, ignoring her  protests.  "Another foolish  mistake.  I convinced myself, whilst  bedridden, that some outside force had tampered in the battle—that no one could  truly best the Blue Thunder without some kind of help…  But you are the second, Saotome Ranma, and  indubitably not the last.  Moreover, you  did it easily.  If the lovely Akane had  not distracted you…" he paused as though the thought pained him.  "…It would have been over far more quickly."</p><p>Kuno lowered himself until he knelt in front of her.  "My life is yours, Saotome Ranma, to do with  what you will.  Though your clothing  does not betoken a noble lineage, your face, your well-defined features, and  your indomitable spirit speaketh more truly.   The house of Kuno is not ashamed to kneel before such a one."</p><p>Ranma's breath quickened with something like sheer panic,  and she glanced at Joi in sheer incredulity.   Upperclassman Kuno kneeling on his broken sword before her was not  exactly what she had expected when she'd come.   She gulped.  "Wh-what about  Akane?  Shouldn't you be offering your  life to her?"</p><p>"I am forbidden to speak with the goddess Akane," he replied  simply, "having lost the fight for her honor."</p><p>Ranma wanted to hit herself.  "Of course," she said, and even she could hear the panic rising  in her voice and feel the blush heating her face.  <i>What now</i>?  "What is  it you're offering me, Kuno?"</p><p>"It is not a business deal," he replied softly.  "What you have, you have whether you wish it  or no.  My life, my services as a  samurai."</p><p>Ranma finally did the only thing she could think of.  "Er, Kuno… you said I only <i>look</i> like  a lady, right?"</p><p>He nodded, viewing her curiously.</p><p>"I don't know what I'm supposed to say next," she confided  sotto voce.  "Men don't usually pop out  of the woodwork and offer their lives to me."</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno had the grace to appear amazed.  "They don't?"</p><p>For the first time (but not the last) Ranma wondered whether  Kuno realized his behavior was out of the ordinary.  "No," she replied, somewhat more curtly.</p><p>He replied, still speaking in the half-whisper with which  Ranma had introduced this topic.  "You  thank me for my great sacrifice and take me into your service," he replied, as  though giving instructions to a bit-part actress who'd forgotten her one line  on opening night.</p><p>Feeling a bit silly, Ranma sighed.  "Well—okay."  She  straightened her shoulders; Saotome Ranma always did things the right way when  she could.  "Kuno…"  She paused again.  "What's your first name?" she inquired.</p><p>"Tatewaki."</p><p>"Kuno Tatewaki," she intoned.  "I thank you for your great sacrifice and take you into my  service."  In a burst of inspiration,  she added,  "you will be expected to do  the following: help me out if I ask, and not bother Tendo Akane unless she says  she wishes it and not before.  Er…  rise."</p><p>He did so.</p><p>"Are you sworn to do whatever I say?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno nodded proudly.</p><p>"Hop on one foot," Ranma ordered.</p><p>He grimaced, but he hopped.</p><p>Joi blinked up at Ranma, then swung his curious gaze to  Tatewaki Kuno.  He barked in confusion,  his eyes following the kendoist's movement, his nose sniffing the air.</p><p>"Just checking.  Well—alright, then,"  the redhead replied, as though something had been settled for the best.  "See you tomorrow.  Oh, and—wear more normal-looking clothing, okay?  I mean, I know I wear some loose stuff but  that's for a reason.  That hakama just  gets in your way when you fight and looks silly besides."</p><p>Kuno nodded as though he had just received orders in war, and strode off.</p><p>Ranma shrugged to herself, then picked up Kuno's pieces of splintered bokken,  popping her finger in her mouth to suck the blood away.</p><p>Kuno seemed the excitable type; likely he'd forget this fealty thing by  tomorrow.</p><p>Ryoga pushed a small branch out of his way, moving with  increased difficulty.  Whoever had put  this large forest in the middle of Tokyo was going to be very, very sorry, he  vowed.  Taking a deep breath, he moved  on, revenge at the burning core of him, sustaining him, keeping him strong for  his trek.</p><p>Darkness pulled at the edges of his vision and he was  combating his desire to sleep with his desire to go and settle his grudge with  Ranma, when a sudden noise behind him made him halt cautiously.  Ryoga brought his combat umbrella to bear,  just in case.  The perennially lost boy  frowned, straining to hear another noise, but sighed when nothing came.</p><p>Just another forest animal…</p><p>…forest animal…?</p><p>Ryoga concentrated again.   The forest had fallen utterly silent.   Cricket's cree-creeing had halted as though a conductor had cut off the  sound with a sharp movement of his hand.   Nothing moved, not even the wind.   All he could hear was his own suddenly labored breath.</p><p>He placed his pack down and began to edge discreetly for a  very high tree.  Bears could climb them,  of course, provided the tree managed to support them—but at least Ryoga could  expect attack from only one direction.   Slowly he turned to face the tree.</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was waking up after a brief  encounter with an English oak.</p><p>And what was one of those doing in Tokyo proper? Ryoga  wondered, pulling himself to his feet.  Whatever  had thrown him was large and fast.  He  kept his back to the tree behind him.   "Show yourself!" he classically demanded.</p><p>The villain classically refused, but it had to close in  eventually, just to strike.  When it  did, Ryoga was ready for it.</p><p>The Lost Boy's readiness did not matter.  The large beast in front of him was, in  fact, utterly indifferent to it.  It  stood, drooling, on four massive legs, each the size of a seventy-year-old  tree, similarly knarled and colored.   Its body was compact in comparison, heavy like an elephant's, but with  nothing like a mastodon's face.  The  face of the animal looked like some kind of mad dog gone wrong; teeth stuck out  at odd angles in various sizes.  It had  a flat snout and its eyes were yellow and mean.</p><p>It gave Ryoga the courtesy of the time it took to process  those facts before once again hurling him bodily into another tree.</p><p>He slid down, cursing weakly.  Ryoga was in bad shape.   He hadn't eaten in three days or slept in two, and he'd just been  smashed against a large, heavy object.   Twice.[1]  He was in bad shape, seeing two of the  monster and not certain which was the real one.  Still, he was Ryoga Hibiki, and that meant not giving up in spite  of, or perhaps because of, the odds.  He  brought his umbrella woozily to bear.</p><p>Ryoga looked down at his hands and made the connection in  his brain—very difficult at this point—that the umbrella had come flying from  his hands in his last confrontation with a tree.  Shaking his head bitterly, he raised his fists instead.  The monster appeared to be resolving into  one, and this spoke well for both Ryoga's endurance and strength of will.</p><p>The beast rushed him boldly— a mistake, as far as Ryoga was  concerned.  It received a punch to the  nose for its trouble, and Ryoga danced away again, still keeping the tree to  his back; no way to tell if these things hunted in packs, and he'd hate to have  this opponent's friends show.</p><p>The monster was slow work to kill, but so was Ryoga.  A punch here—a successful eye jab—and the  monster looked about ready to limp off after easier prey.  Then, in a sudden lunge it came for him,  scoring his side with large, yellow teeth.</p><p>Ryoga held a hand over the blood rushing from his wound,  gasping through pain and fighting for consciousness.  Everything was going dim—and he could not allow that—</p><p>The dog-beast moved for one, last, desperate attempt to  overwhelm its enemy, loping to Ryoga with a wicked blood-filled grin.</p><p>Ryoga returned it, battle singing in his veins, chuckling as  he felt his own blood run rapidly through his fingers.  A final gearing up, a final punch, a final  launch into the air…</p><p>He gasped triumphantly, then blinked.  How had he ended up looking at the stars  like this?  He didn't remember lying  down; that was funny.  No, but he needed  to get up.  He had a good reason, too,  if only he could remember what it was, or what he was doing on the cold ground.</p><p>There was somebody he was looking for—that was it.  Somebody who he needed to see.  That didn't sound quite right, but it was  close enough—more than enough to launch somebody as stubborn as Hibiki Ryoga  onto his feet.  And if launch was too  strong a word—if raise or stand or perhaps crawl was strictly more  accurate—then this author is willing to overlook the matter.</p><p>But the time always comes when one cannot overlook such  inconsequentials.  When one has to face  death and note that it is coming.</p><p>Fast.</p><p>Ranma had dreams that night.  She was facing a dark, cold, lonely plain.  She could see one indistinct figure on the  other side, but it was impossible to tell who it was from that distance.  Ranma looked down, surprised.  Other than the recurring nightmares she had  about falling into the Nannichuan, this was the first time she'd ever dreamed  herself as a girl.</p><p>Just as she looked down, she realized how silly she'd been  to think she was in a field; she was sitting on top of the teacher's desk,  facing her students, one leg crossed demurely on top of the other.  "Now, minna-san," she said in a calm,  feminine voice.  "Can anybody tell me  what we have here?" she inquired, gesturing to herself with a giggle.</p><p>Akane raised her hand.   "A person with two X chromosomes?" she inquired.</p><p>"Don't be silly!   Next!" Ranma commanded, picking Hikaru out of the crowd.  He was the only one not raising his  hand.  Honestly, if she didn't pick on  him, he'd never say a word.</p><p>"An incredibly hot girl I want to have lots of sex with," he  offered quietly.</p><p>"We're getting warmer," Ranma replied.  "Anybody else?  Kuno!"</p><p>Tatewaki bowed.  "My  lady," he answered confidently.</p><p>Ranma sighed.  "I'm afraid  you're quite far off the mark there, dear," she replied with the air of someone  having gone over the same lesson countless times.  She re-crossed her legs.   "Can't anybody come to a conclusion here?" she demanded.  "Yes?   You, the bald man in the back!"</p><p>Genma stood and bowed.   "A martial artist and my son."</p><p>The entire class laughed at that one, Ranma hardest of  all.  "Hardly!" she giggled.  She cupped her breasts with her hands.  "Even Akane's more right than you!"</p><p>Akane fumed.</p><p>Sayuri and Yuka spoke up together.  "A nice girl!" they exclaimed.</p><p>"What's that?" Ranma inquired, a teacher asking for a  definition.</p><p>The two girls fell silent and shrugged.  "Somebody who does what they're told," Akane  answered, her voice stubborn and flat, "which makes <i>you</i> unqualified."</p><p>Ranma smiled at her, knowing she was simply stinging from  her incorrect answer, before.  "Why  don't you give it another try, Akane?" she inquired solicitously.</p><p>She was sitting next to Akane under a tree with spreading  branches.  "Why don't you give it  another try?"  She realized she was  offering Akane a bento.</p><p>The dark-haired girl blinked, seeming as surprised about the  change of scene as Ranma herself.   "Where are we <i>now</i>?" she demanded.</p><p>"This is how it goes," Ranma informed her, trying to  forestall any outburst.  "Just try the  lunch, okay?"</p><p>Akane opened the bento cautiously.  "Looks okay from the outside," she offered, "but sometimes that's  the most deadly."</p><p>"What do you think it is?" Ranma inquired, trying to keep  her own temper from showing.</p><p>"What did you put in it?" Akane demanded.  "Poison?   I'm allergic to some stuff, you know."</p><p>"I dunno.  My dad  made it."</p><p>"Your mom help?"</p><p>"Not really.  Not since I was five, anyway."[2]</p><p>Akane wrinkled her nose.  "And you're giving it to me?"</p><p>The redhead found herself very embarrassed for some  reason.  "Try it, first."</p><p>Akane took a small bite.   "Wow, Ranma—it's <i>is</i> good.   Guess sometimes the ends justify the means, huh?"</p><p>A cat strode through the background for a moment, but when  Ranma blinked, it was gone.</p><p>"Y-yeah," Ranma replied, a little confused as to what that  had to do with anything.  "Yeah,  sometimes."</p><p>"Mind if I finish it?" Akane inquired.  "It's good, you know," she assured the  redhead, as though wondering whether Ranma had already forgotten.</p><p>"That's fine," she replied.   "Not very hungry anyways."  She  paused to look up at the branches of the trees.  Was something moving?   No—that was her imagination.</p><p>Akane's eyes were suddenly bright and hard.  "Are you <i>certain</i> you don't want any  for yourself?  It <i>is</i> yours, you  know."</p><p>"Akane—are there any cats in the trees?"</p><p>"Of course not—then they can't climb down.  There are cats everyplace else," she  finished calmly, swallowing the last bit of lunch.</p><p>Ranma gazed at Akane in horror, only now realizing exactly  how hungry she really was.</p><p>"Come, now, Ranma," Akane chided her.  "You did give it to me to keep, after all."</p><p>"If there aren't any cats in the tree, shouldn't I be up  there?" Ranma demanded, her voice beginning to show traces of panic.</p><p>"Gosh, Ranma, we're all cats down here," Akane replied  conversationally.  "Didn't you know  that?"  She began to lick her hands  clean methodically.  All around her the  cats appeared, eyes glowing in sudden darkness.</p><p>Ranma backed away from Akane slowly and carefully, trying  not to lose it entirely.  How could she  have not noticed something that blindingly evident?  Of course!  It seemed so  clear now… they were everyplace, obviously, obviously…  As they closed in on her, Ranma felt her  sanity begin to slip…</p><p>"Ranma?  Ranma?  Ranma!"</p><p>Ranma sat up and screamed bloody murder, banging her head on  Akane's.  The dark-haired girl had been  leaning over her, trying to shake her awake.</p><p>With every moment Ranma continued to scream, Akane felt  herself become more panicked in response.   "S-stop!  Ranma!"</p><p>Ranma paused to gather a deep breath and began to scream  again.</p><p>Tripping over Joi (again) Akane stumbled over to her doorway  and flicked her lights on.  The redhead  was just beginning to look around as though realizing that she was now  awake.  Her eyes lit on Akane and she  scrabbled away wildly, ending up in the corner but still seated on Akane's bed.</p><p>The dark-haired girl paused, hurt in her eyes but willing to  hold her ground until the wild look in Ranma's eyes eased.</p><p>Nabiki and Kasumi spilled into the room.  "W-what?" Nabiki demanded incoherently.</p><p>Kasumi viewed the huddled form of Ranma and gasped.  "Oh dear!   Ranma-chan, are you alright?"</p><p>Ranma was holding her hands in front of her, blinking  dazedly as though she didn't recognize herself.  Then, very slowly, she raised her eyes to examine each of the  Tendo girls in turn.  "Akane?"</p><p>Akane took a deep breath, filled with relief, before  flinging herself onto the bed and drawing Ranma into her embrace.</p><p>In a moment, there were four girls sitting on the bed.  Nabiki, half-asleep but still needed, was  propped up by Akane and Ranma's bodies.   Kasumi was leaning in from the other side, her longer arms encircling all  of the girls tightly.  Joi came close to  the bed and sorrowfully rested his nose on Kasumi's bare foot.</p><p>In this small cocoon, Ranma slowly came to herself, realized  that she had been sobbing for quite awhile now, felt ashamed, wished she could  stop, could not.  The dream kept  twisting around in her brain, but the only thing she could place was something…  something to do with cats…</p><p>Not being able to remember was the worst part.  The redhead felt a creeping, eerie fear  enclose her heart and squeeze.  Slowly  she came to a halt, from sobs to tears, from tears to sniffles, and from sniffles  to hiccoughs.</p><p>"Water," Nabiki mumbled, and shuffled off to the bathroom.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Ranma said quickly.</p><p>"<i>I'm</i> sorry!" Kasumi returned.  "Are you alright, dear?  Are you hurt?"</p><p>Ranma shook her head, tears starting again, running down her  cheeks.  She wiped them away, too raw  and emotional to even know why Kasumi's statement had started her off  again.  She shook her head quietly, not  trusting herself to speak in a clear voice—or, for that matter, make sense if  she managed to hold her tone steady.   "Nightmare," she finally whispered, and hiccoughed.</p><p>Nabiki reappeared, placing water in Ranma's grasp.  She made sure both of Ranma's shaking hands  were on the cup before letting go.  The  redhead swallowed several times past the large lump in her throat.</p><p>Soun Tendo poked his head inside the bedroom, the family  shinai in his hands.</p><p>"It's alright, father," Kasumi said, her voice still in a  whisper.  She still managed to sound as  though she'd been awake for hours.</p><p>He nodded, offered a sympathetic glance to Ranma and shut  the door quietly behind him.</p><p>Ranma slowly drank her water, gradually becoming aware that  Akane's grip was making it hard for her to breathe, that Kasumi had a gentle  hand on her upper leg and was stroking her calmly like a frightened, wild  beast, that Nabiki was regarding her somberly, now more awake than perhaps  Ranma had ever seen her before.</p><p>"Some nightmare," the middle Tendo daughter commented, and  for some reason, that prompted a harsh chuckle from the redhead.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"And Akane, honey, you're strangling  your fiancée."</p><p>Akane let up slightly.   "Sorry, Ranma."</p><p>The ache of her arms eased, but the redhead almost wished  she'd continued on.  Sure, she would  have died of asphyxiation—but what a way to go.  Slowly, Ranma leaned back, letting Akane hold her more gently in  her arms.</p><p>"Come on, Ranma-chan," Kasumi advised gently, pulling Ranma  to her feet.  "Why don't I draw us all a  hot bath.  I'm certain I couldn't go  back to sleep, now; Nabiki?"</p><p>Nabiki shook her head, and Ranma noticed with a small amount  of distraction how Nabiki's right hand kept making small movements, almost  twitches.  Quite calmly, she wondered  whether Nabiki was pondering helping her down the hallway with said appendage  or was regretting the absence of her camera.</p><p>"A bath sounds like just the thing," Akane replied, her  voice full of relief for her older sister's knack at making people feel  comfortable.  "I'll get that special  bubble bath you gave me," she offered.</p><p>Kasumi nodded.</p><p>"I have some liquor," Nabiki added.</p><p>Both Ranma and Akane blinked in surprise, but Kasumi nodded  gratefully.  "Just the thing."</p><p>Ranma's series of shocks were catching up with her.  Apparently Akane had managed to forget that  Ranma was not a natural girl—hell, she herself had managed to forget that too,  enough to think that a hot bath sounded like a fabulous idea.  Blinking, she came a bit more to herself,  still mechanically drinking her water.</p><p>Kasumi went off to draw the bath while Nabiki went off in  search of some seriously strong stuff; Akane searched for her bubble bath in  her room, digging through her chest of drawers.</p><p>Ranma's mind raced, but it was still slow from terror.  A building nightmare began to play itself in  Ranma's mind again, this one all too real.   Nabiki and Kasumi throwing her out into the night in her male form,  throwing things at her, calling her a pervert.   Akane standing at the back door, looking despondent but resigned.</p><p>And it seemed all the redhead could manage to do was sit  wrapped in Akane's blanket, wisps of hair coming undone from her braid, her  bare feet sticking out, while this scenario ran in her mind over and over with  interesting little variations.  In some,  she died by seppuku or by the hands of one of the Tendo girls.  In some, Akane renounced her rather than  live with her family's recriminations.</p><p>Ranma blinked as Akane literally pulled her off of the bed  and carried her, plopping the bath salts into Ranma's lap as though she did  this every day.  Joi yipped, startled by  this new development.  "Don't worry,  Ranma, it'll be okay," Akane said, and she used that same  impossible-not-to-trust voice she'd given the redhead that very first day, when  she said she'd believed.</p><p>Ranma sighed, tension suddenly leaving her, her head relaxing  almost bonelessly against Akane's shoulder.   A tiny part of her managed to be surprised that she trusted the other  girl this much when she was so scared out of her mind.</p><p>Akane set Ranma down inside the bathroom, handing Kasumi the  bath salts that had gone rolling across the cold tiles.  Akane lit some small candles and began to  disrobe.  "Oh… Kasumi?"</p><p>"Hm?"  Ranma noticed  that Kasumi was keeping a close eye on her, despite the older girl's apparent  calm and apparent attention to Akane's question.</p><p>"You know how Ranma was raised as a boy, don't you?" she  inquired softly.  When Kasumi nodded,  she continued.  "She's still very  embarrassed about seeing other girls and about being seen <i>by</i> them… I  think the light, and the hot water, and our company will relax her, but perhaps  we should all close our eyes."</p><p>Kasumi's voice lowered even further, but Ranma wasn't so out  of it that she didn't hear.  "Akane,  that's just what I was talking to you about earlier.  Ranma must get over these things if she ever wishes to be a  normal young woman, like you."</p><p>Akane snorted, then considered her response.  "Maybe," she conceded.  "But tonight's not the time to push."</p><p>Kasumi stole a look at Ranma and nodded.  She closed her eyes, beginning to undress  from feel.  Akane did the same, before  winking at Ranma.</p><p>The redhead's eyes flooded again, again for no seemingly  discernible reason.</p><p>Nabiki entered and began watching her sisters disrobe while  blind.  "A new game?" she inquired  dryly.  Then her eyes narrowed  shrewdly.  "Ranma was raised as a boy…"</p><p>Akane nodded, and Nabiki gamely closed her eyes.  The three of them stepped into the tub by  feel and waited for Ranma.</p><p>Ranma didn't close her eyes at first, merely turning her  back, disrobing.  She kept her eyes at  half-mast in order to see her feet, then stepped into the vacant space of water  the girls had left for her.  She sighed  deeply as she submerged herself, eyes closed, hoping vaguely that no one's  hands would wander by accident.</p><p>Each of the Tendos sighed, too, one after the other, none  giving any indication that Ranma's near fit had put them out.  Even Nabiki, whom Ranma had begun to  perceive as somewhat selfish (pictures of her sister indeed!) didn't say  anything about being woken in the middle of the night to tend to her.</p><p>As each of the sisters seemed inclined to simply lie there  without speaking, Ranma began to relax his muscles, began to lessen his fears.</p><p>"What was it about, Ranma?"</p><p>With his eyes closed, it was difficult to tell which Tendo  sister had asked.  They usually had such  different <i>tones</i> of voice… but tired sympathy emanated from each one.</p><p>Ranma opened his mouth to reply and realized they'd  immediately recognize the change in the martial artist's voice.</p><p>He cleared his throat…</p><p>"You don't have to say if you don't want to, Ranma."</p><p>Why couldn't he tell who was who?  He should at least be able to pick out Akane amongst the voices;  or perhaps those two comments had been from the other girls.  "Thanks," he whispered.</p><p>He blinked, eyes open for a moment, before furiously closing  them.  Husky, tear-masked whispers  sounded just the same, to a certain point.   He continued.  "Is it okay if I  tell you after I get out?"</p><p>"Hm," somebody agreed, shifting.  Kasumi—that had been Kasumi for sure.  Ranma was almost sure, anyway.</p><p>Akane giggled.  "This  is kind of neat.  Blind baths."</p><p>A wide grin spread across Ranma's face.  He <i>did</i> recognize her, after all.</p><p>"It <i>is</i> a novelty," Nabiki said softly.  Ranma had the sudden impression her eyes  were open, and squirmed.</p><p>"Would you three mind getting me some things from the market  later?" And that had to be Kasumi.</p><p>"Nope," Nabiki said.   "What do you need?"</p><p>"We're all awake.   Why don't we just go this morning?" Akane queried.  "These shops open early, don't they,  Kasumi?"</p><p>Kasumi considered, straightening in the bath a bit.  "Certainly—most of the shops I visit open  sometime between five and six-thirty.   We could go to the open-air market."</p><p>"What time is it?" Nabiki wondered lazily.  "It feels closer to three or four."</p><p>"Eyes!" Akane warned, in case Nabiki was feeling like  checking.</p><p>Ranma let their warm chatter wash over him, like the hot  water in the bath.  Once again the  oddness of the normalcy struck him: sisters, bathing together, talking about  going into market.  As Kasumi chattered  about what it was that could be obtained this early in the morning, as Nabiki  finally began to stop listening for Ranma's voice, as Akane eased herself into  the conversation, Ranma sat back and let himself soak in their presence.  For some reason, it made his chest hurt for  a moment, with a sharp, brief little pain.</p><p>Slowly, the water cooled, and the sisters helped one another  out of the bath, giggling, eyes still pressed shut.  After he was certain all three sisters were out of his way and in  no danger of accidentally 'discovering' him, Ranma followed them, his own eyes  closed.  Suddenly he felt the shock of  cool water falling over his head—Akane, he deduced, saving him again.</p><p>A towel was thrust into Ranma's hands.  The redhead moved to wrap it around her  waist before shaking her head and raising its level a bit.  She needed to start thinking a <i>little</i>  more like a girl, provided she wanted to survive.</p><p>"I'm decent," Nabiki announced.</p><p>"Are not," Kasumi chided, playfulness in her voice.</p><p>"Nabiki never was," Akane giggled.  "It's okay, Ranma, you can open your eyes."</p><p>Ranma's blue eyes flickered open to view three girls, each  with a towel tied just above her breasts.   Akane and Kasumi had pinned their hair up against the water, and misty  ringlets were forming around Akane's face; she tried not to stare.</p><p>"Let's get some clothing and meet downstairs," Kasumi  suggested, creaking the bath door open slowly so as not to wake her father or  Saotome-san.  Each of the girls crept to  her respective room.</p><p>Ranma and Akane dressed silently, but Ranma could feel the  other girl's eyes on her, making certain she was alright.  She did feel better now, but she didn't  relish telling her story to the three sisters.   Something in her shied away from that idea.</p><p>Downstairs, Kasumi was pouring herbal tea into four cups.  Nabiki was poring over the stock report,  yawning widely.</p><p>"It's later than I thought," she announced as the pair  descended, flicking her newspaper.   "Nearly five; it's already been delivered."</p><p>Akane nudged Ranma and the pair sat down at the table.</p><p>As Ranma began speaking, drinking her tea (carefully), she  kept her eyes focused on the same watermark on the tabletop.  It made speaking easier, she found, if she  couldn't see the reactions of the Tendo sisters.  She spoke in a quiet, even voice, describing the Catfist training  in detail, trying not to sound too horrified.</p><p>And then she began to talk in an even smaller voice, a  whisper really, telling them what she had never even told her father.</p><p>The nightmares after the training had been quite  understandable, even from Genma's considerably distorted point of view.  The problem was, they had not stopped nor  had their intensity faded.  Each one  tended to be at least as terrible as the one before it, if not somehow worse;  she maintained that they'd been getting better lately, because of her father's  insistence that the recurring dreams were womanly.  Announcing a womanly thing to girls who thought her a woman  already wasn't half as bad as she thought it'd be.</p><p>When she finished her tale, she looked up.  Kasumi's face was white and gaunt, and some  of the cheery innocence in her eyes was broken.  Akane had a look of murderous rage on her face; after a moment,  she excused herself.</p><p>Sounds of destruction and mayhem sounded from the dojo.</p><p>Nabiki scooted next to Ranma and wrapped an arm around her  waist.  "So you have these dreams,  right?" she inquired.  "And if you spend  too much time around a cat, you lose it?"</p><p>Ranma nodded, looking into Nabiki's brown eyes.</p><p>"Honey—you're lucky you're not completely insane," Nabiki announced  bluntly.  "I'm proud of you for managing  to survive all of that intact in the noggin."</p><p>Kasumi nodded, looking a bit more like her old self.  "That's right, Ranma," she finished softly,  but Ranma could tell she was struggling with herself in some way or another,  though not with what emotion.  "You're  very lucky you turned out as well as you did.   Very lucky," she repeated.</p><p>A particularly murderous scream rent the air, followed by a  large smashing noise.</p><p>"Akane thinks so too," she added, smiling gently.  "I know she likes you very much.  It speaks incredibly well for you that  you're… well… not a savage, or something," the eldest Tendo daughter finished  inelegantly.</p><p>"Or permanently insane.  Nobody's saying you should be happy you've  got these terrible nightmares, but think of being stuck in one for the rest of  your life."  Nabiki looked at her  seriously.</p><p>"Thanks, Nabiki," Ranma said dryly, not sure whether she  meant it.  But, well, it sure did put  things into perspective.</p><p>"Come on, Ranma," Nabiki ordered, pulling the redhead to her  feet.  "We're going shopping."</p><p>"Hn?"</p><p>"I'll get Akane," Kasumi announced, slipping out the back  door.</p><p>The redhead blinked, surprised.  Somehow she'd expected all three girls to be in tears or turn her  away—not this.  Ranma sighed, thinking  she'd probably never get girls, period.</p><p>Soon the four were ready, Akane wiping her eyes; Ranma  pretended not to notice that, or Akane's hand particularly tight inside her  own.  Kasumi clutched her shopping bag  to her chest, still obviously disturbed.</p><p>Outside, the sun was about to rise.  Mist crept along the street in front of the  girls like some kind of lazy animal stretching, parting easily in front of  them.  The sidewalks were mostly  deserted, and Ranma began to get the strange feeling that there were only four  people who truly existed in the world.   The water hanging in the air hushed their footfalls.</p><p>Maybe water <i>was</i> sentient.  At least, it had sure seemed that way on her trip from  China.  She'd never lasted more than a  day or so as a boy before some kind of natural accident drenched her in cold  water.</p><p>"I love this time of morning," Kasumi whispered, her voice  in a childlike hush.  "Everything's so  fairy tale."</p><p>Ranma smiled at her as they walked along.  Kasumi only saw the happy things.  She bit her lip, briefly regretting telling  the eldest Tendo girl anything about her own childhood.</p><p>Suddenly, as though it was born of  the air around them, an open-air market became distinguishable.  Formless shapes became geometric stalls;  shapeless heaps morphed into apples and nuts, piled carelessly atop one  another.  Wraithlike figures resolved  into farmers, butchers and bakers laying out trays of their wares, early  shoppers, and a pair of children chasing one another around and screeching  gleefully.</p><p>"Kasumi-san!" a voice exclaimed cheerfully.</p><p>Kasumi grinned, delighted, to introduce Ranma to a pair of  young farmers running a cabbage stall.   "This is Hiako Nobaya and her husband, Umio Nobaya, Ranma.  Minna-san, this is Ranma, the girl I  mentioned the other day."</p><p>The pair bowed.   "Nice to see a young girl taking an interest in selecting her own  ingredients—you don't see that all the time, do you Hiako?" Umio inquired  solicitously.</p><p>Ranma reddened, but she managed to laugh like she agreed all  the same.</p><p>"We always buy our cabbage from the Nobayas," Kasumi  explained.</p><p>"Kasumi-san!"   Another voice came floating out of the mist.</p><p>"Excuse me," Kasumi said, bowing to the group.  "Nabiki, will you pay?"</p><p>Nabiki blinked at the cabbages in front of her warily, as  though she suspected one might bite.   "Akane?"</p><p>Akane moved to peer at the vegetables herself,  shrugging.  "Aren't all of them good?"  she whispered.</p><p>Ranma bowed to the couple.   "Excuse me, we're a bunch of modern city girls.  Which ones are best?"  She smiled winningly.</p><p>Hiako smiled at her.   "Kasumi usually buys three."   After a brief examination, the young shopkeeper handed Ranma three  cabbages—lovely specimens of the breed—and charged Nabiki 152 yen.  "Kini, don't you <i>dare</i>!" she cried to  one of the little children running wild.   "Excuse me," she pleaded to the girls, palms together.  "Kini, we do not pull our brother by the  hair!"</p><p>As they strode after Kasumi, Nabiki whispered behind her  hand.  "Geez, Ranma, you really know how  to turn on the feminine charm."</p><p>"I've never seen you do that before," Akane added, looping  her arm into the redhead's again.</p><p>Ranma chuckled embarrassedly.  "Well…"</p><p>"Over here!"  Kasumi  waved her hand in the air, beckoning the other girls.</p><p>The redhead was introduced to a seemingly endless number of  shopkeepers, all of whom proclaimed her a sweet and lovely young lady.</p><p>"What a nice girl," one old bread-seller lady had  proclaimed, but something in Ranma bristled.   She still managed a polite but strained smile, however.</p><p>Kasumi's woven bag was filling, and Ranma couldn't help but  think of the food the eldest girl was about to cook with the greatest  anticipation.  Fresh fishes of several  different sorts lined the bottom; heavy vegetables like green tomato and onion  were next, followed by apples and several kinds of nuts.  At the very top were the three cabbages and  some grapes, for snacking.  Each looked  and smelled as fresh as Ranma had ever seen any of their ilk, and some were  glistening with morning dew.  It was all  the redhead could do not to just grab the grapes for herself.</p><p>In fact, she was beginning to feel kind of hungry, and was  looking forward to breakfast.  Nabiki  purloined the grapes out of Kasumi's bag herself, snapping off bits for the  other girls to eat, so Ranma's curiosity as to their flavor was satisfied.</p><p>The mist lifted now, leaving morning dew on the grass[3]  and lifting the sense of the otherworldly away.  People were beginning to wake now—businessmen leaving for work in  Tokyo proper joined the very old and the very young on the streets.  They slipped outside carrying briefcases,  wearing dark suits and beleaguered expressions, walking with the gait of the  half-asleep.  Some women appeared, too,  wearing business dresses, some carrying briefcases of their own: businessladies  and OL's.[4]  But Ranma noticed that they were few and far  between.</p><p>The park was utterly deserted, Ranma noted, except for one  young mother who was half-asleep herself, sitting on a park bench with one foot  resting on the wheel of her baby's carriage; she rocked her heel, moving the  carriage back and forth gently.  She  looked exhausted, and Ranma wondered briefly how long she'd been there.[5]  The redhead also found herself wondering why  so many girls wanted lots of babies, since it was obviously so hard to take care  of them.  Maybe it was all hype, she  decided, and they never really knew how difficult it was until they tried.</p><p>Even now, she heard Kasumi and Akane sigh almost  simultaneously, a sound of someday.</p><p>As she was looking at the pair with a puzzled expression on  her face, Akane made a soft exclamation.   "Do you see <i>that</i>?"</p><p>Ranma followed the path of the girl's pointing finger and  noticed that there was some kind of coat half-hidden under some bushes near the  outskirts of the park.  Privately she  applauded Akane's observational skills; it was yellow and dark green, and  blended nicely.  Still, she wondered why  Akane had called their attention to it.</p><p>Until it moved.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>[1] Plus, it is  perhaps important here to note that although Ryoga <i>is</i> tough, he has not  yet undergone Cologne's Breaking Point Technique training.  I.E. rocks and other hard objects ought to  phase him.  I am quite aware that if  this had been latter-day Ryoga, such pittances merely would have irritated him.</p><p>[2] Genma took Ranma  away from his mother when he was five years old.</p><p>[3] And Ranma  said to herself… <i>My goodness, how lovely.. and I don't believe I've ever  noticed it before…</i></p><p>[4] "Office  Ladies".  Think someplace between a  secretary and a maid.  Lady of choice  for married men to dally with.</p><p>[5] Boy, I just  can't resist those cameos, can I?</p>
