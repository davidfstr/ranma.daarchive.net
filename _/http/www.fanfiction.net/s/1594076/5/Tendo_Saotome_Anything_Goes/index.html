</div><p>CHAPTER FIVE: the Path and the Way</p><p>Shampoo's eyes were everywhere.  They scanned the darkened trees around her, scanned the sky  above, and scanned the path ahead.  Why  hadn't she simply agreed to let stupid Mousse come along?  At least then, there would be two sets of  eyes.  Besides, she was pretty sure  Mousse had been to Japan, once upon a time.   Shampoo was already far beyond the roads she'd traveled.</p><p>The Juketsuzoku had a name for that, and it meant being out  of your element as well as out of your experience: outside your stride.  Shampoo had been outside of her stride for  the last twenty miles, easily.  Now, she  was beginning to wonder if any of the rumors about foreigners were really true:  did some of them really have horns?   Were their women kept in chains and forced to do labor?  A host of terrible images swam past  Shampoo's eyes.  If the latter was so,  she would spend her life where it was good currency.</p><p>The warrior finally crouched down, poking at the flames with  a handy stick, pushing the tinder closer to the heart of the fire.  In moments, she was in a half-trance, her  lids half-lowered as she stared into the flames.  There was something hypnotic about fire, she decided – the way it  sparked and danced.  It was so beautiful,  and so very very dangerous.  Weapons  were forged in fire, blades and hammers, arrows and daggers.  Fire was destruction embodied.  It devoured without a thought.</p><p>Shampoo wished her journey long over.  Even though she'd originally been more than  pleased to leave the village, she was already missing things like the practice  arena, the bathing pool, and her own, cozy little cabin – not to mention her  great-grandmamma, and even Mousse, the bumbling fool.  Far away from Juketsuzoku, it was easy to see that he loved her  very desperately, but she knew her growing acceptance of the fact would wear  thin the moment he reappeared.  Baka  Mousse.</p><p>Besides, she had a job to do.  Not a job she was really looking forward to, but a job  nonetheless.  Gods, she just wanted to  go <i>home</i>.</p><p>Shampoo sighed, laying down by her pitiful little fire, and  attempted to sleep.</p><p>Her dreams were of murder.</p><p>A loud crack woke her.   Shampoo rolled immediately and with blinding speed, pulling two shinai  from the ground where she had carefully placed them, ending in a half-kneel,  her weapons raised.  "Who goes there?"  she called out.  When no one replied,  Shampoo's eyes narrowed and she stood cautiously, trying to keep an eye on  every direction.  Whatever was moving  out there was making a great deal of noise; it was not making an effort in the  slightest to disguise its movement.   That made it an animal or an absurdly confident person.</p><p>Or, perhaps, simply somebody lost in the forest, not  expecting to see anybody at all.</p><p>Shampoo stood silent as a stone, waiting.  It was a big thing, whatever it was.  At least twice her size, perhaps a bit more  massive than that.  She would wait until  she saw it before moving to attack.</p><p>A glimmer of white and she was death personified, leaping with  an almost unnatural grace, one shinai extended, one pulled close to her ribs.</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was sailing through the air in  the opposite direction.  With a massive  effort, she flipped to land on her feet—to face her enemy.  He wore a white gi and spectacles that  fastened behind his ears.  "<i>You!</i>"  she exclaimed.</p><p>"Kuso!" the man exclaimed.   "Doco—doco wa?"[1]</p><p>Shampoo blinked.   "Un," she articulated intelligently.   "You're Japanese, I forgot."   While it was obvious he'd asked her a question, she was otherwise at a  loss.  She wondered briefly if she  should try to kill him—he <i>had</i> eaten all of her food, the greedy  jerk.  However, she was simply too  curious about seeing him again, and besides, it was his daughter she really had  the quarrel with.  "What are you <i>doing</i>  here?" she demanded.  "If you're trying  to get back to Japan, you should know you're going the wrong way."  If he failed to amuse her, she could always  kill him later.  <i>This</i> one she  might even <i>enjoy</i>.</p><p>"So ka; onna wa Chogoku-jin desu,"[2]  the man mused, shrugging to himself.</p><p>Shampoo threw her hands into the air in a gesture of  exasperation, and pointed him back the way he'd come.</p><p>He shook his head firmly, catching on almost immediately,  and pointed towards the village.</p><p>Shampoo frowned.  "And what business do you have with us?" she queried, lifting her  chin and gazing at him with her grandmother's patented high-priestess  expression plastered across her face.</p><p>He shook his head as though this was an utter waste of time;  and, Shampoo had to admit, perhaps it was.   Then he attempted to barrel his way past her.</p><p>She danced back and forth, remaining in front of the heavier  man.  "No way!  You think you'll get away with that?  I'm the best warrior in my village, you overgrown sack of yams,  and I'm not going to let you get there just to wreak some extra-special havoc  you missed wreaking last time!"</p><p>"Wakarimasu ka?   Maaa," he groaned, placing a hand on his forehead.  "Shikata ga arimasen."[3]</p><p>"That's right, stupid Japanese," Shampoo said, nodding.  "So you're just going to have to turn right  around—ne?" she finished in mocking tones.   She knew what 'ne' meant, at least.</p><p>The old man sighed, and pointed to himself.  "Genma," he said clearly.</p><p>The purple-haired girl grimaced, but decided to play along.  She was still interested, but her patience  was waning.  She put her own hand to her  heart.  "Shan Pu," she said clearly.</p><p>"Nani?"</p><p>"Shan," she said slowly.   "Pu."</p><p>"Shampoo?"</p><p>It was close enough.   She shrugged, nodding.</p><p>Genma considered for a moment, then raised his hand, palm  down, to about Shampoo's height.</p><p>"Yes, yes, somebody that size," Shampoo recited,  nodding.  "You're looking for your  daughter?  Well, so am I."  She smiled congenially, but shrugged and  shook her head.  She hadn't seen the  redhead since several weeks ago back in the village.</p><p>She'd gotten it wrong; the man wasn't looking for his  daughter.  He wanted something <i>for</i>  her.  What it was, Shampoo couldn't even  begin to guess: the man's gesticulations got more and more difficult to  interpret as he went on.</p><p>"Enough!" Shampoo exclaimed, batting his hands away.  "I can't tell what you mean, so just stop  trying!"  Didn't this idiotic male  realize he was conversing with a Juketsuzoku maiden?  He was wasting her time!</p><p>He held his hand up in front of her face, his middle finger  upright.[4]</p><p>"One more try, fine," Shampoo said, sighing and  nodding.  After that, she'd punch the  idiot in the gut, maybe make a small wound so he couldn't follow her, and then  be on her way.</p><p>Genma paused, considering.   His hands moved up and down.</p><p>"Water," the girl said, yawning with boredom.  To communicate her understanding, she  mimicked drinking.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"Well what the hell else goes up and down like  that—hills?"  Shampoo bit her lip, then  formed an up-side-down V with her hands to indicate a mountain.</p><p>He nodded excitedly, then moved his hands again in the same  pattern.</p><p>"Yes, the damned hills, I got that part already," she  snapped.</p><p>Genma smiled at her sunnily, and stopped his movement,  pointing at...</p><p>"Valley," Shampoo replied.   She veed her hands again, and he pointed at the base of the mountain for  her.  "Yes, valley.  What about it?"</p><p>Genma flattened one hand at eye level.  His other hand mimed something falling  towards the flattened area.</p><p>"Hn?  Fall?  Somebody fell into a valley?"  Shampoo blinked, suddenly going rigid.  In her limited experience, it was easy to  reach the end of Genma's story long before he was finished.  "Jhusenkyo," she confirmed.  It was not really a question.</p><p>"Jhusenkyo," he repeated, nodding.  "Ranma."</p><p>"Your kid.  Your  daughter.  Jhusenkyo," she repeated  thoughtfully.  "So, what does the dead  girl turn into?"</p><p>Genma pointed at Shampoo emphatically.</p><p>"What about me?" she queried.</p><p>He sighed.  He pointed  to himself, then to Shampoo.</p><p>"I'm not getting you."   Shampoo shook her head, arms crossed across her chest.</p><p>Genma stared at her for a moment, then pointed at her  breasts, one at a time.</p><p>The Juketsuzoku blinked at him, taking a step back.  "You'll pay for that one, you dirty  old...  <i>woman</i>!  You mean Ranma fell into Spring of Drowned  Girl!  Hah!  But that won't do anything, it'll just..."  Shampoo blinked again, dazedly, realizing  that Ranma had fallen in before she'd had ever met the girl.  Ranma could be anything!  A bug that happened to fall into the spring,  or more likely a highly intelligent animal like a dog or jaguar, or even a  rat—she was relatively certain such things could be taught to speak if they had  the right equipment, had human vocal chords.   "Ranma... isn't... a pet or anything... is she?  She's a guy?"  The purple-haired girl quickly moved to explain herself.  "Ranma," she said clearly, then pointed at  Genma.  The message was clear: is Ranma  like you?</p><p>Genma nodded.</p><p>Shampoo sighed gratefully.   So she just had to marry him!</p><p>Just?  If anything,  that was even more complicated!  She  began cursing under her breath quietly in Chinese.</p><p>Genma obviously thought she was sympathizing; he nodded and  looked distraught.</p><p>"Okay," she said, "okay.   Right.  I should go back to the  elders and ask—but no!  I'm already a  day's travel away.  Go back now and we  lose two, and Ranma's tracks aren't fresh as it is.  Besides which, there's the other thing, far more important..."</p><p>The older martial artist seemed to notice that Shampoo was  talking to herself, because he waited respectfully while she rambled on.</p><p>Shampoo shook her head to clear it.  The law was perfectly solid in such cases;  she didn't need anyone's permission to bag Ranma and bring her—er,  him—home.  "All right, old man," Shampoo  said contemptuously.  "Where is Ranma?"</p><p>And though it did take awhile, they each managed to explain  where the other had to go to get what they wanted.</p><p>"Kill me now," Ranma begged.</p><p>"I'm not going to kill you," Akane said firmly.  "Take these."  She handed Ranma a small glass of water and three pills.</p><p>"But I'm half-dead already," the redhead whined.  "It'd be a mercy."</p><p>"No, <i>thank</i> you," Akane said, patting her on the head.  "Drink up, girl.  The pain will be half that bad in twenty minutes or so."</p><p>"Only half?" she queried in a small voice.  "That still leaves me one-quarter dead!"</p><p>"Ehhhh!" Akane exclaimed in frustration.  "Come downstairs when you feel you can <i>stand</i>,  okay?"</p><p>Ranma blinked suspiciously at the pills in her hand.  To be perfectly honest, other than simple  stuff like aspirin and rubbing alcohol, her experience with any kind of  medicine passed straight through 'limited' and into 'nonexistant'.  She didn't like the idea of ingesting  anything that was specifically engineered to mess around with her body.</p><p>On the other hand, there was that slightly distracting  blinding pain, she reminded herself.   Ranma gulped down the three pills, chasing them with the entire glass of  cool water Akane had handed her.</p><p>Oh, crap!  Why had  she listened?  Why had she swallowed so  much as a gulp of air?</p><p>"Oh, Ranma!"   Kasumi's voice came floating up from downstairs.  "Ranma, dear!  Come down, we have red beans and rice!"[5]</p><p>Lovely.  The whole  family knew of her agony.</p><p>"I'll be there in ten minutes, Kasumi!" she called.  Her plan of changing back to a boy and  re-proving her masculinity had fallen flat on its face.  First of all, she could scarcely move, and  second of all, her attempt to change back via hot water had been...  problematic...</p><p>Of course, Akane had done her best to help the redhead out,  even when Ranma had briefly changed forms, which always seemed to make her very  nervous.  But even Akane could neither  cure nor explain away Ranma-kun's debilitating dizziness.  Ranma was stuck as a girl for the next  several days, at least if she wished to walk in a straight line.  It was a toss-up as to whether the symptoms  were worse when she was a girl or a guy, come to think of it.</p><p>Slowly, she pushed herself to her feet, feeling as though  her center of gravity was two feet lower than before.  Ranma blinked forcefully to settle the room and moved downstairs,  one step at a time.  How pitiful!  When Ranma was a guy, she could have taken  them all in one leap.</p><p><i>Don't be an idiot</i>, a cool voice sounded in his  head.  <i>It's not because you're a  girl, it's because you're a girl at <u>this</u> particular time</i>.</p><p>"Hmph," Ranma said aloud, moving into the kitchen.  "Uhm... Kasumi," she began as the other girl  bustled around the kitchen, "you don't really have to..."</p><p>"Nonsense!" Kasumi announced.  "I made red beans and rice for Nabiki, I made red beans and rice  for Akane, and I'm going to make them for you!   You're a part of this family, Ranma."</p><p>Ranma surprised herself by blinking back tears and emitting  an "okay" that sounded much smaller than it had in her head.  She took her traditional place next to Akane  and waited.  The pills did seem to be  working—she no longer felt she should jump out of Akane's window and try to aim  so she landed on her head.</p><p>"Psst."  Akane nudged  Ranma and passed her a small object.</p><p>"What is it?" Ranma inquired.  "Hey, it's warm!"</p><p>"It's a hot water bottle," she explained.  "You can keep it while you're sitting here,  anyway."</p><p>"It's <i>filled</i> with <i>hot water</i>?  Talk about trouble, looking for a place  to...  ahhh..."  Ranma literally moaned in pleasure as Akane  pressed it to her stomach.  The redhead  would have liked to know a great deal about the whys of that one, as she was  certainly stumped.  How should hot water  pressed to her stomach help?  Was it  cold, and that was why it was giving her all this trouble?  Geez!</p><p>Unable to look a gift horse in the mouth for long, Ranma  thanked Akane.  How did girls learn  about this stuff?  "I feel normal  again," she announced sotto voce to Akane.   "Only a bit of pain, and I can deal with it."</p><p>"Great, Ranma!  I'm  glad I could help."  She offered the  other girl a dazzling smile.</p><p>Ranma bit her lip and sighed.  Akane could look so beautiful like that, when she was helping  people.  Maybe she'd become a nurse, or  something, so she could help people all the time.  The downside was that while Ranma loved being helped by Akane,  and sometimes needed her aid, it seemed that was all the other girl wanted of  her.  Somebody to play mother to.  When Ranma was certain she felt... something  else.</p><p>The redhead blushed, her situation becoming clear to her for  the first time.  She was in a very nice  guy's house, under false pretenses—the pretense that she was female and had  always been—and she'd been sleeping with his baby girl for about a week  now.  Neither sister knew about her  curse, either, though they knew about her past.  Not only was she freeloading as of yet (she'd only been to work  at Tofu-sensei's once) but she was also setting herself and everyone in this  house up for a giant disappointment.</p><p><i>Failure as a woman</i>, she thought to herself glumly, <i>failure  as a man.  You don't know what you're <u>doing</u>  Saotome Ranma!</i></p><p>The only thing Ranma knew about Soun Tendo was that he was  unpredictable.  She had no way of  gauging his reaction if—no, when—he discovered she was a guy.</p><p>"Does it still hurt that bad?" Akane inquired solicitously.</p><p>Ranma broke off her depressed musings for a moment to shake  her head.  "Just thinking of something  sad," she replied.  "Akane... what was  the homework yesterday?"</p><p>Akane beamed.  "You  can copy, just this once," she said softly, and gave Ranma a wink.</p><p>The redhead sighed.</p><p>Just as Kasumi was placing their plates in front of them,  Nabiki stumbled downstairs.  "Whereza  pain killers?" she demanded.  "Oh!"  Her eyes met Ranma's.  "Congratulations, I had no idea it was your  first time.  Welcome to the  hell-once-a-month club.  Kasumi," she  growled.  "Painkillers."</p><p>Akane leapt up and offered Nabiki the bottle she'd given  Ranma.</p><p>"Thanks, li'l sis."   Nabiki gulped four of them, chewing.</p><p>While Ranma and Akane's features twisted into identical  pictures of disgust at the thought of chewing bitter aspirin, Kasumi laid Nabiki's  plate in front of her.  "Isn't it... a  bit off, dear?"</p><p>"<i>Yeah</i>, it's a bit off," Nabiki growled.  "It wasn't supposed to be here for another  day or two at least."</p><p>"Oh my!  I suppose  little Ranma has managed to yank us all a bit off-course."</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma looked up from where she'd been eating.  "I... I didn't mean to..."</p><p>Kasumi ruffled her hair.   "Not a problem dear.  We'll just  have to plan ahead.  Akane?"</p><p>Akane nodded.  "Yeah,  sure oneechan."</p><p>"You're not telling me you girls all get it at the same  time?  No way!" Ranma laughed.</p><p>The three Tendos stared at her in something like shock.</p><p>"Oh, Akane, this <i>so</i> falls to you," Nabiki said.  "Give me the damn hot water bottle, Ranma,  you're done with it."</p><p>"But—"</p><p>"Gimmie!"</p><p>Ranma sighed, but forked it over.  Immediately she started to feel worse, but not half as bad as  before.</p><p>"You well enough to go to school, Ranma?" Akane inquired.</p><p>"Bring the medicine and I think I'll be okay," the redhead  replied, grabbing her bookbag in one hand and standing.  "Thank you for the food, Kasumi—it was very  good."</p><p>The pair bowed and ran outside.</p><p>"She walks in beauty like the night—of cloudless climbs and  starry skies.  And all that's best of  dark and bright, meet in her aspect, and her eyes."</p><p>"Kuno!" Ranma and Akane exclaimed.  Ranma's voice was amused, but Akane's had a decidedly rough edge.</p><p>Kuno smiled at them both, bowing to Ranma, and continued:  "One shade more, one ray the less, had half impaired the nameless grace which  waves in every raven tress, or softly lightens o'er her face—"</p><p>"Raven tresses?   You're not allowed to talk to me, Kuno," Akane warned.</p><p>"...where thoughts serenely sweet express how pure, how dear  their dwelling place." [6]</p><p>Ranma grinned, thinking Kuno had described Akane perfectly.  She clapped delightedly, but turned to see  Akane fuming.  "You're not allowed to <i>talk</i>  to me!" she repeated.</p><p>"Lady Ranma, did you enjoy that?" he queried.</p><p>"It was pretty," Ranma admitted, unable to keep a wry smile  off her face.</p><p>"I was reciting for your pleasure solely," he said quietly,  a wry smile on his own features.  "Just  so you know."</p><p>"Ah."  Ranma nodded  wisely, then altered her expression when she met Akane's eyes, which were full  of anger and scorn.</p><p>"I'll <i>die</i> before I let some boy beat me!" Akane  barked.</p><p>Kuno's grin slowly disappeared as Akane spun on her heel and  continued towards the school.</p><p>"Do you know what that means?" Ranma inquired, staring after  the other girl.</p><p>Kuno shook his head rapidly but silently.  "Why does she continue to surprise the both  of us so?" he demanded finally.</p><p>Ranma shrugged.   "Because that's who she is," she said softly, an expression of  puzzlement adorning her features.</p><p>Kuno blinked at the redhead.  "Indeed, that is so," he replied, but he kept staring at Ranma,  who gazed unblinkingly after Akane.</p><p>"I want you to do something for me."</p><p>"What is this favor you ask?"</p><p>"I want you to apologize to Akane."  The redhead continued walking for several  paces before she realized Kuno had halted in utter surprise.</p><p>"But... for what?"</p><p>Ranma tripped on her own feet.  "Heh... heh..."</p><p>"Did I offend her in some way?"</p><p>Ranma wondered, not for the first time, and certainly not  for the last, if Kuno understood just what a big dolt he was.  "Just apologize.  Don't say why, don't say what for.  Just apologize.  In the  best way you know how."</p><p>Kuno considered for a moment.  "What you say is wise, Saotome Ranma.  If I have offended her in some way, this is my best chance to  discover it."</p><p>"Ah... yeah," Ranma replied.  "What you said."  Ranma  grimaced as she ran through all her problems in her head.  "Hey—one other thing.  Where did you get those photographs of me 'n  Akane?"</p><p>"Those lovely shots were taken by Tendo Nabiki."</p><p>"Only Nabiki?"</p><p>Kuno paused, considering.   "Oh—no.  There was also that  forgettable fellow, what's-his-name.   Ah.  Yes.  Gosunkugi.   Hikaru Gosunkugi."</p><p>For a moment, Ranma realized what people meant by 'seeing  red'.  Her closed fists shook with  repressed emotion.  "Oh, he is <i>so</i>  dead."</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Well, what do you think, that me and Akane <i>liked</i> our  home being invaded like that?"</p><p>Kuno considered.   "But, it means that you are desired—desirable!  Isn't that what you want?"</p><p>Ranma growled, then forced herself to calm down.  "Look, I don't know where the hell you get  your information on women, but we don't <i>exist</i> to be admired."  Ranma didn't like how easily that 'we' had  come to her lips, but she tried not to show it.</p><p>"I'm sure that's the way it seems to <i>you</i>..." Kuno  replied.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened briefly in surprise; could he really be  that stupid?  Then her lip curled in  disgust.  "If that's how you want it—on  guard!"  Ranma brought her hands up in  front of her and narrowed her eyes.</p><p>"But... Lady Ranma..."</p><p>"If you won't <i>listen </i>to sense, I'll have to <i>beat  it in you</i>!"</p><p>"I... I apologize..."</p><p>"Too late!  I won't  forgive you!" Ranma cried, and attacked.</p><p>Immediately, the redhead noticed something different in the  way Kuno was attacking her.  To  rephrase, he was <i>not</i> attacking.   He dodged most of her efforts, simply taking a hit if and when he had no  other option.  "Lady... Ranma...  please!" he interjected.</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath and stepped back.  "Well, it is more of a beating, ain't  it..."  She paused, blushing as she  suddenly realized what she'd just done—and right after promising that gym  teacher guy she wouldn't!  Boy, she  could be so <i>dumb</i> sometimes.   "Gee, Kuno, I'm really sorry, I shouldn't have done that..."</p><p>"No... I am certain I needed... to be punished."</p><p>Ranma blushed again for a reason she couldn't quite  define.  "I...I..." she stammered  briefly before gathering herself together.   "Look, you've just got a lot to learn about girls, okay?"</p><p>"And you'll teach me?"</p><p>The redhead turned to face him, taking aback by the degree  of hope in the boy's voice.  His  expression was a bit more open, too: his usual smirk was in place, but his  slightly widened eyes and the tilt of his chin indicated somehow that he was  mocking himself all of a sudden.  "Yeah,  maybe," she replied jauntily.  "If you  behave yourself, that is."</p><p>They had finally reached the school; Kuno held the door open  for her and she slipped inside.  "Don't  worry, Lady Ranma," he replied with a smile.   "I trust you to give me a decent whap when I make a mistake."  With a cheerful wave, he took off down the  hall in the opposite direction from the redhead.</p><p>Ranma sighed.   "Great.  A guy who likes to be  hit by girls.  How do I get myself into  these situations?"  After a moment,  though, her expression of bemusement shifted to pure anger.  "When I get my hands on Hikaru, I'm going to  murder him!"  She clenched her fist in  front of her and growled.</p><p>"Wait, no, wait a minute.   I need to solve this without using violence.  But how am I going to do that?"</p><p>Ranma spent the greater part of the day chewing her pencil  and staring off into space, scarcely paying any attention to her lessons.  Maybe she could just scare Hikaru?  Imply he'd be injured?</p><p><i>To fight because of boredom, or to show someone you're  bigger and stronger is cowardice.</i>   Akane had told Ranma she believed that, the very first time they'd  met.  Even though it was less than a  week ago it seemed like eons.  And  though Ranma had been surprised to hear a martial artist say that at the time,  it seemed to make a great deal of sense now, especially in light of the way  she'd lost control yesterday.</p><p>A beam of warm sunlight illuminated Ranma's features.  She smiled, and closed her eyes.  She might just know a way—but she'd need  Akane's help, and Mister Tendo's, too.</p><p>Ranma's blue eyes invariably drew to Akane, like magnet to  lodestone.  It seemed like ever since  she'd started hanging around Kuno, Akane had been getting more and more angry  with her.  Although she'd accepted Ranma's  apology last time—more or less—she appeared to have expected Ranma to give Kuno  up.  And Ranma, having two friends in  this world—three, if you counted Nabiki—was not willing to do such a  thing.  Especially when the whole school  appeared to be against her, otherwise.</p><p>Well, Ranma could link up the first plan with a second.  Oddly impressed with her own cleverness,  Ranma began to focus on her lessons.</p><p>At break, she moved to the back of the room purposefully.</p><p>"What do <i>you</i> want?" Hikaru demanded.</p><p>"Hmph," the redhead replied.  "Good.  And how are you?"</p><p>"Busy."</p><p>Ranma snatched his sketchbook briefly away.  "Interesting material," she said  softly.  "You have Akane's eyes <i>just</i>  right."</p><p>"Give that back!"</p><p>"Listen, Hikaru," Ranma replied, dancing around him.  "<i>LISTEN!</i>  And you'll get it back."</p><p>The other boy froze.   "Why do you want to torment me?"</p><p>Ranma blinked at him.   "Boy, you have a soul after all.   Okay.  I'm willing to make a deal  with you.  You're bored, aren't you?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Well, you sit around all day, drawing and imagining stuff,  and taking pictures..."</p><p>He gulped, and brought his hands in front of his face  instinctively.</p><p>Ranma stared at him.   "Geez, kid."  She was suddenly  even happier she hadn't decided to hit him.   "Listen up.  You don't take any  pictures of either of us—you don't draw us or spread rumors about us—and I'm  willing to give you something in return.   Are you even listening to me?"</p><p>Hikaru lowered his hands.   "I didn't—"</p><p>"You <i>did</i>," Ranma replied.  "Don't bother denying it.   And if I catch you doing it again–"   The redhead paused, unable to complete the thought.  What, exactly, would she do?  She couldn't hit this guy, not somebody so  weak.</p><p>Apparently her little trail into nothingness and her  thoughtful, faraway eyes caused Gosunkugi endless torment.  Ranma sighed; he had a way better imagination  than she did, she guessed.</p><p>"W-w-what's the deal?" he stammered.</p><p>"I'll teach you martial arts," Ranma announced calmly.</p><p>There was a brief silence in which he blinked at her in  sheer incredulity.  Then he began to  laugh hysterically.  Several students  turned to stare at the pair.</p><p>"Shh!"  Ranma pressed  both hands against his mouth.   "Baka!  I'm serious!"</p><p>"Muh at's upith," he proclaimed.</p><p>"Huh?"  Ranma leaned  back, removing her hands.</p><p>"That's stupid," he replied coldly.  "Look, Ranma, I don't know what game you're  playing, but if you're going to beat me up for taking pictures of you, I'd  rather you did it right now, rather than in some excuse for a training  exercise."</p><p>"Clever."  It was the  first thing that came to mind, although Ranma decided she probably shouldn't  have said it aloud.  It seemed too much  like a confirmation for her taste.</p><p>"Hah!  I know.  Besides, even <i>I</i> know Anything-Goes  Martial Arts isn't accepting any students.   The Tendo Training Hall's been closed for years."</p><p>Ranma brightened.   "That's where you're wrong.  I  have another student already, training under me n' Akane."</p><p>"Oh yeah, who?"</p><p>Ranma smiled innocently, letting the question hang in the  air a moment.  "Kuno Tatewaki."</p><p>"N-no way!"</p><p>"Way.  And Tendo's  already given me his permission.  He  said I'm far enough along in the art to begin teaching."  <i>Or at least, that's what I hope he'll do  when I ask him.</i>  "So whaddaya say,  Hikaru?"</p><p>He slowly became slightly less guarded.  "U-uhm... why do you want me to train with  you?" he inquired in a small voice.</p><p>"I want you to stop lurking around my yard without  permission, that's why," Ranma replied tartly, "and I'd rather do it without  beating you up.  Not that I couldn't,"  her pride forced her to tack on as she eyed him critically.  "Besides, I figure if you're busy with  martial arts, you won't have the time to be so obsessively gloomy."</p><p>His face fell, and for a moment, she wondered if she'd gone  too far.  "How do I know you've really  got another student?" he demanded, but in a much less belligerent tone than the  one he usually used when speaking to her.</p><p>"Baaaaka.  I thought  you were the brilliant one."  She rapped  him smartly on the forehead.  "Who else  could've told me you were responsible for the ecchi photos?"</p><p>"I'll consider it," Hikaru finally replied after a long  pause.</p><p>"You'll consider it," she replied, her voice dropping  several degrees, "or <i>I'll</i> have to consider my other options.  I'll give you 'til the end of lunch to  decide."</p><p>When Akane met Ranma's gaze questioningly, the redhead  winked.  She was new at this kind of  stuff, but she was pretty sure she had him.   Not only that, but she'd done it with a minimum of threats and  absolutely no violence.</p><p>At lunch, seated under the infamous oak tree, Ranma  explained her plan.</p><p>"Ranma, are you serious?   That's nuts!  We're not old  enough to teach!  You're sixteen, like  me—right?"</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "Doesn't matter.  I'm already way  more skilled than most people <i>ever</i> get."</p><p>"Well... me, too... but..."</p><p>"Besides, how hard can it be?  We just do it and they imitate us!"</p><p>"We—they?"  Akane  raised her eyebrow.  "Saotome Ranma,"  she tacked on in a threatening voice.</p><p>Ranma laughed nervously.   "Well—you'll help me, won't you, Akane?"</p><p>Akane sighed.  "I  guess.  It's just sparring, and I have  to start again someplace.  But I don't  ever want to have to hurt somebody again, Ranma."</p><p>"If you're good enough, you don't have to," Ranma replied.</p><p>Akane sniffed.   "There's always someone better.   Still... I guess you're kind of right..."</p><p>"Great!  Now our  other student—the other half of the 'they'..."</p><p>"Lady Ranma!"</p><p>Ranma blinked.   "Speak of the devil!" she exclaimed.</p><p>Akane bristled.  "You  don't mean to tell me that <i>he's</i>..."</p><p>"Akane Tendo."</p><p>Akane stared at Kuno.   "Oh, so you've decided to address me at last, upperclassman.  Guess your promises aren't worth much."</p><p>"Lady Ranma bid me speak, and so speak I must," he  replied.  "Especially since both edicts  came from her lips."</p><p>Akane shot the redhead a murderous look; Ranma, in turn,  tried to look innocent and placating at once, a look that said <i>please,  endure this just one moment longer</i>.</p><p>"I must apologize," he continued.</p><p>Akane's neck swiveled so fast that Ranma was certain the  Tendo girl would be getting whiplash.   "Huh?"</p><p>"I have been grievously unfair to you, dear Akane," he  continued, his voice low and heartfelt.   "I cannot imagine how I could have done you such a wrong.  I beg forgiveness."  He knelt next to her.</p><p>Akane's eyebrows went up and down and her mouth opened and  closed.</p><p>"Now, for what is it that I am sorry?" he inquired of Ranma,  who attempted to shush him, too late.</p><p>When Akane whirled to silently stare at the redhead again,  Ranma instantly resumed her <i>please understand what I'm trying to do here</i>  look.  "Heh.  Well, he's <i>trying</i>..."</p><p>"He sure is," Akane responded flatly.  "Upperclassman, I'm going to try to explain  this just once more, and then never again.   Do you understand me?"</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>"I listed all your wrongs for you in the past.  A day or so ago, to be perfectly  precise.  Despite what people sometimes  say about me, I don't enjoy being cruel and so I won't enjoy repeating  myself.  But you force me."</p><p>Ranma met Kuno's gaze.   She sensed that he, for once, was taking Akane Tendo seriously.  "Go on, madam," he implored.</p><p>Akane nodded.  "You  have hounded me, most improprietously.   You made a challenge <i>for</i> me, <i>about</i> me, which I had no part  in.  I did not appreciate boys swarming  me every day.  You drove others away  from me- the girls in jealousy, and the boys because they'd begun to elevate  me to the status of a goddess, a status that I did not want.  Either that, or they followed me around,  undressing me with their eyes.  You <i>caused</i>  this situation, Kuno, and I am very, <i>very</i> pissed off about it!"</p><p>"But... my lady?"   The second half of Kuno's query was directed towards Ranma, who nodded,  giving him permission to speak.  "It was  not I who created that situation; you did."</p><p>Akane blinked.   "Huh?"</p><p>"Your radiant beauty was not a secret before I shouted it  o'er the rooftops; the other young men at school would have worshipped you and  the other ladies would have been jealous were I never to have attended  Furinkan."</p><p>Akane paused for a moment, obviously charmed.  "That's as may be," she finally replied,  gathering herself.  "But you set up that  entire challenge situation.  It's so  demeaning, Kuno!"</p><p>"It seems more of a homage to your exquisite self," he  countered.  "That fight is a shrine to  your very desirability.  'Helen, thy  beauty is to me, as—"</p><p>"Now is not the time to recite," Ranma snapped, feeling she  had to save the situation as best she could.   "Now listen, Kuno.  Did you hear  what she said?"</p><p>"She did not like to be fought over in such a manner," he  repeated dutifully.</p><p>"It's no use, Ranma," Akane said in an angry, frustrated  growl.  "He's repeating what I'm saying,  but he doesn't understand."</p><p>Ranma fought with despair.   "Okay, look, Kuno.  Lemmie try to  paint a picture for you."</p><p>"Inks?"</p><p>Ranma whapped him on the back of the head, as promised.  "Close your eyes, idiot."</p><p>"If you wish it."   Obediently, Kuno's eyes closed.</p><p>"Now, imagine <i>you're</i> a girl.  Better yet... you're a girl who has your  personality, unaltered.  You've got a  girl's <i>body</i>."</p><p>Akane almost snickered.</p><p>"And all these guys are rushing you.  They're imagining having sex with you, and  the sole reason they fight is because the little perverts are happy you touch  them, even if it is with fists and feet.   This goes on for ages."</p><p>Akane broke in, sounding a lot less amused.  "They think you like hitting guys.  They even put whips and handcuffs in your  locker as a joke—or as an invitation, you can't be sure which."</p><p>"And there's this one guy in particular, who keeps egging  them on.  Full of himself,"</p><p>"skilled and all, really," Akane added, "though he seems to  think he's god's gift-"</p><p>"who just from the fact that you're breathing and female  assumes you'd want him."</p><p>"Do you understand?" they demanded in unison.</p><p>He opened his eyes.   "So the girl is Akane?"</p><p>"He can be taught!" Ranma exclaimed.  Seeing Kuno's hurt look, Ranma's eyes  softened.  "You have to admit you've  been pretty dense about this," she said in a slightly more reassuring tone.</p><p>"All of those boys are thinking of you as a sexual object?"  he demanded of Akane.  "Why—if I thought  that, I'd... I'd..."</p><p>"Much as I hate to ask this, and as much as I'm sure I'll  regret it," Akane began timidly, "exactly how is it that <i>you</i> think of  me, upperclassman?  If not like that?"</p><p>Kuno put a hand to his heart in abject shock.  "Why—as my future wife of course!  The mother of my children!"</p><p>Ranma dropped further until her face was pressed into the  dirt.</p><p>Akane merely started giggling despite best efforts.</p><p>"And you think..." Ranma mumbled.</p><p>Akane and Kuno leaned closed towards Ranma; it was hard to  make out her words with her face pressed into the dirt like that.</p><p>"...you think that's what most of the boys want Akane  for?  For a wife?"</p><p>The pair drew back.</p><p>"Of course!" Kuno exclaimed.</p><p>"Handcuffs," Akane reminded him dryly.</p><p>"Perhaps they believed those things—the whip and the  handcuffs..." he cleared his throat suddenly, "...would aid you in battle?"</p><p>Akane barked a laugh; Ranma mumbled something to the  earthworms.</p><p>"...perhaps not..."   Kuno looked bemused.  "I must  admit a concern for your welfare, then, Tendo Akane.  If all those boys..."</p><p>"I defeat them all the time, don't I?" Akane demanded in  that same, dry tone.</p><p>"But... an ambush, or..."</p><p>"It's been done," Akane broke in.  She yawned, one hand flapping over her mouth unconcernedly.  "Boy, I'm sleepy!"</p><p>"Why, this is atrocious!" Kuno exclaimed.</p><p>Ranma put one hand up into the air to make a point.  Still to the earthworms, apparently,  although Akane could guess what she was telling them.</p><p>"That is not what I wish of you, Tendo Akane," Kuno finally  said calmly.</p><p>"Well, good to know."</p><p>"So you forgive me?   You'll go out with me?"</p><p>"No!" Akane exclaimed.   "Haven't you been listening?"</p><p>"But we've just cleared up this little misunderstanding  between us!"</p><p>"Kuno—<i>I.   Don't.  Like.  You</i>.   And nothing you say is going to change that!  While you've elevated yourself slightly above the rest of the  drooling horde just now, they have the moral integrity of pond scum in my  book!  I <i>won't</i> date with you and  I don't want to marry you either!   Besides... I already have someone I like."</p><p>Ranma sighed, lifting her face out of the dirt and moving  her fingers quickly through her bangs to dislodge particles of soil.  She thought she knew whom Akane was talking  about.  A flash of glasses and Joi's  barking came immediately to mind.</p><p>Kuno swallowed.  "I  am sorry I have caused you so very much pain, Tendo Akane.  You will always have been my first love, and  I will always admire your beauty, though it be from afar.  However—you need fear no more...  overtures... from me."</p><p>Akane sighed in relief.   "Thank you, Kuno-sempai," she breathed.</p><p>"That said..." Ranma broke in with a grin.</p><p>"Oh, yeah," Akane recalled, sounding reluctant.</p><p>"Would you like to train with us?" Ranma queried.</p><p>"<i>Under us</i>," Akane stressed.  "We'd be your teachers."</p><p>"Does my Lady wish it of me?"</p><p>Ranma considered.   "Kuno, it's your decision.   You've admitted to me that the two of us are better than you.  Well, we can help bring you up to speed—if  you'll have us."  Ranma's face split  into a grin.  "Besides, you need to learn  more about girls— if you wanna survive, that is."</p><p>"Agreed, then: I shall walk the road of heaven[7].  When doth my training commence?"</p><p>"It just did," Ranma replied with a wry smile.</p><p>It was what her father had first said to her when they set  out for their very first training mission.   The idea that everything was training had somehow stuck with Ranma, far  more than many of Genma's other ideas[8],  and kept him sharp.  Even more than  that, it had impressed upon the martial artist that all of life should be taken  as a fun but complex challenge, a puzzle to be sorted out; it was Ranma's  cornerstone and support, not just in martial arts but in everything.  Whenever a difficult situation came up,  Ranma usually just thought of it as good training.</p><p>"I'm in training now?" Kuno inquired doubtfully.</p><p>"Yes," Ranma replied casually.  "Be outside to walk us home after kendo practice, okay?  Then you'll see what I mean."</p><p>Hikaru Gosunkugi came trotting up to the trio.  "H-hi," he stammered, revealing his  nervousness.</p><p>Ranma put on her kindest expression; he was usually so  defensive.  "Hey.  Made up your mind?"</p><p>The small boy nodded nervously.  "I've decided... okay.   Yeah.  If you can promise I won't  get hurt."</p><p>"I can't do that," Ranma protested.  "You could easily pull a muscle or  something.  I promise you won't get  seriously injured, though, not if I can help it."</p><p>"It'll have to do," Hikaru replied.  "H-h-h-hi, Akane," he stammered, suddenly  seeming to realize she was there.</p><p>"Hi, Hikaru," Akane said smiling at him.</p><p>Hikaru mumbled something under his breath that sounded  suspiciously like 'she <i>spoke</i> to me!' and stared off into space with a  dazed grin.  After Kuno jabbed him in  the leg with his elbow accidentally-on-purpose, he came slowly out of his  daze.  "S-so when do I start?"</p><p>Ranma made a mental note to keep him around Akane way more  often.  He was a lot nicer!  "Right now."</p><p>"Thursday's good for—huh?"</p><p>Kuno smirked.   "Training has already begun," he intoned.  At a glare from Akane, his smirk dropped. "So I'm told," he  added.</p><p>"Now?  I mean, <i>already</i>?  But... I'm not ready!  I'm not prepared!"</p><p>"Which is why we're training you."</p><p>"We?"</p><p>"Yeah, Akane and me," Ranma replied gamely.  This got the expected response.  "Well, maybe just me, at first," she  conceded dryly.</p><p>Akane looked confused.   Boy, the girl just didn't know a guy liked her unless he ran at her  screaming <i>AKANE, DATE ME!</i>, did she?   Maybe she'd just gotten way too used to that approach.</p><p>Ranma looked around at the three of them, suddenly feeling a  great deal of significance attach to the moment.  Her first students.  Did  she really know what she was getting into?   Akane was hard enough to handle, but Kuno was twice as difficult, if not  more so.  And Hikaru was so defensive  and prickly that she could scarcely speak to him without becoming angry  herself.</p><p><i>This will be good training</i>, she thought firmly.</p><p>Gym class was so boring for Ranma that she ended up using it  as an excuse to train.  "I saw you two,"  Akane said as the pair of them retrieved their belongings from their  lockers.  "Poor Hikaru!  He looked half-dead!"</p><p>"I made him stretch," Ranma protested defensively.  "Besides, he has to know it'll be hard on  him.  And I only made him jog around the  gym three times!"</p><p>"He ran like the wind.   Jog my foot."</p><p>"He's fast for a beginner," Ranma noted, "and flexible,  too.  Though man, he's graceless!  Well, we'll see."</p><p>"You're really serious about this!" Akane exclaimed.  Her expression clouded.  "I don't know how daddy's going to like the  idea of us taking students."</p><p>"I'm going to have to leave it up to you to broach the  subject with him," Ranma warned.  "I  have work after school.  We could both  do it at dinner, but something tells me you'd have more success than I would."</p><p>"Maybe," she conceded, pushing her hair behind one ear with  a sweep of her hand.</p><p>"I'm counting on you, Akane, so try your best, okay?"</p><p>Akane straightened perceptibly.  "I'll try!"  Then her face  fell.  "Ranma, about Kuno..."</p><p>"Look—he'll keep hounding you for the rest of your life  unless you deal with him," the redhead asserted.  "And I think that this is the best way.  You can teach him manners!"</p><p>Akane blinked for a moment as she considered this, but then  she shook her head.  "You can't teach  somebody manners like that.  I sure  can't."</p><p>"But Akane, you taught <i>me</i> manners!"</p><p>The dark haired girl colored.  "I... that is..."</p><p>Ranma was somehow oddly satisfied to see her stammer trail  off into nothingness.  "Come on," she  said.  "Let's get to class."</p><p>Block.  Strike.  Weave.   Duck, stab.</p><p>"Point!"</p><p>Block.  Block.  Parry, feint.  Weave.  Swish!</p><p>"Point!"</p><p>Hop.  Block.  Block.   Parry.  Block.  Weave.   Sweep.  Duck.  "Oof!"</p><p>"Point!"</p><p>Lean, block, crossguard strike, weave, swish swish  swish!  Strike!</p><p>"Point—third point and match, to Tatewaki Kuno!"</p><p>"You got one past me, underclassman.  It takes a great man to have the ability to  strike a Kuno.  You are fierce."  He bowed.</p><p>"You flatter me, sempai!"   The freshman bowed too, flushing from more than the exercise and obviously  suffering from—or enjoying—a staggering amount of hero-worship.</p><p>Kuno turned.  "Lady  Ranma!"</p><p>"Patterns, patterns everywhere," Ranma replied.  "Your students don't seem to think."</p><p>"Heh!  Well,  indubitably <i>you</i>, at least, will point out my flaws.  Shall we go?"</p><p>Ranma stood, followed by Akane, who brushed her skirts  fastidiously, avoiding Kuno's eyes.  "I  have to go to work, so Akane-san will have to take up your training after  three.  And if she tells me you've  misbehaved, I shall be most put out."</p><p>Akane raised an eyebrow at the redhead, who winked.  She'd gotten the hang of how to deal with  Kuno surprisingly quickly.  It was  becoming an instinct by now.</p><p>Kuno paused in walking to bow deeply in Akane's  direction.  "I would not dream of  insulting her, nor would I dare."</p><p>"Good to hear.  Are  you ready, Sir Kuno?"  Ranma's voice was  light and full of mischief.</p><p>"I am."</p><p>Ranma pointed up to the fence beside her.  "Then—up!"   The redhead's feet left the ground as though she'd merely pushed  off.  She landed on the fence, balancing  easily on one foot, her other knee pulled to her chest and both arms out.  "Come on, Kuno!  Akane!"</p><p>Akane frowned.  "Not  'til he does.  I don't want him to see  up my skirt."</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno blinked up at the redhead, his expression  anxious.  "Why—madam—I am not sure—"</p><p>"And 'not sure' and a dollar will get you a ride to Tokyo  Tower, young student.  Up!"</p><p>Kuno visibly gulped, but put his briefcase down and jumped.</p><p>He almost landed on Ranma, who managed to leap back several  feet just in time.</p><p>Waving his arms wildly for balance, he almost managed to hit  the other girl several times.  "If I'm  defeated by your ineptitude alone," Ranma said snidely, ducking as one of  Kuno's flailing arms narrowly avoided slapping her, "I'll never forgive you."</p><p>Suddenly he steadied, as if by magic.  Ranma peered behind him to see that Akane  had grabbed his shoulder.  "Calm down,"  she said in a surprisingly even voice, "or you'll fall straight off of here."</p><p>The redhead blinked.   Akane was standing on the fence like she did it every day, her feet  bare—she had removed her shoes and socks, and held both her bag and Kuno's in  one hand.  Otherwise, she looked as  collected and comfortable as if she were standing on solid ground.</p><p>Ranma's eyes moved back to Kuno, who was wobbling only  slightly, now.  In contrast to Akane, he  appeared oddly discomfited.</p><p>"Turn," Ranma commanded.</p><p>Kuno blinked at her.   "H-how much?"</p><p>"All the way around," Akane commanded, " 'til you're facing  me."</p><p>Ranma nodded; Akane was anticipating her.</p><p>Kuno blinked.  "I...  I'm not sure I can keep my legs like..."</p><p>"Oh, for heaven's sake!"   Akane lifted the kendoist bodily and turned him around.</p><p>Ranma stared, unabashedly amazed.  Akane had lifted Kuno like he was made of balsa wood!</p><p>Kuno appeared to be similarly startled, but Akane either did  not notice or did not care that the pair were staring at her like they'd never  seen her before.[9]</p><p>"Walk," Ranma commanded, shaking off her surprise.</p><p>Akane began to stride forward, her arms out for balance.  "Well?" she called over her shoulder.</p><p>Kuno continued, too, arms out, walking carefully down the  chain-link fence, Ranma close behind him, watching for any sign he was about to  tip.  Akane, for her part, did not  appear to need such babysitting.  She kept  her arms out, but that small concession to the danger was the only one she  paid; her strides were smooth and she did not seem nervous in the slightest.</p><p>"Keep up!" Akane ordered, as though walking at an everyday  pace on the top of a fence was a perfectly normal thing to do.</p><p>Kuno and Ranma followed her, albeit slightly more  slowly.  After a moment, Ranma put her  arms down, convinced Kuno was not about to fall.  In movement, it was somehow easier to keep balance; he was moving  more smoothly, now, his steps more assured.</p><p>After several minutes, they finally arrived at the Tendo  house.  Akane dismounted, her skirt  flying up to her waist and revealing to the world that she had chosen to wear  polka-dotted panties that day.</p><p>With a groan, Kuno fell off of the fence face-first, a  trickle of blood running out of one nostril.</p><p>"Whoops."  Akane  frowned at the fallen boy.</p><p>"You did that on purpose," Ranma accused dryly.</p><p>The Tendo girl gasped.   "Did not!"  But her lips twitched  as she turned on her heel to go get her gi.</p><p>Kasumi came sweeping towards the genkan as the pair entered  the Tendo home.  "Who is your guest,  Ranma?"</p><p>"Oh!"  Ranma  grinned.  "Sorry.  This is Kuno Tatewaki."</p><p>Kasumi's smile widened.   "Oh my, how wonderful!  Father,  Ranma has a guest!"</p><p>Soun came in from the dojo looking slightly sweaty in his  brown gi.  "Ah, who's this?"</p><p>Kuno bowed.  "Kuno  Tatewaki, at your service."  He cleared  his throat.  "There are those who call  me Kuno."</p><p>"I see."  Soun's  smile widened in exactly the same fashion as Kasumi's had.</p><p>Ranma and Kuno were startled into exchanging a wary glance  with one another.  Kuno frowned in  consternation.  "You told me you'd let  me know when I said or did something inappropriate," he accused in a slight  undertone.</p><p>She shrugged helplessly.   "Sorry – I'm as confused as you are."   She turned back to the pair.   "Kuno's a martial artist," she added to Kasumi and Soun, who were still  looking like they'd won the lottery.</p><p>"Why, how marvelous!" Kasumi exclaimed.  "Kuno-san, would you like some tea?"</p><p>"Kuno-san?  Did I  hear <i>Kuno-san</i>?"  Nabiki came down  the steps like a gazelle, using her weight and momentum to bound down until she  was face-to-face with the increasingly uncomfortable Ranma and Kuno.</p><p>"I'll go make some tea," Kasumi finished without a  discernible break.</p><p>"I hope your intentions are honorable with our Ranma," Soun  admonished, draping an arm around the redhead's shoulders.</p><p>Kuno blinked.  "I  think you misunderstand."</p><p>Nabiki placed one hand over her mouth in utter shock.  "You're dating!"</p><p>Akane followed her sister down the stairs.  "I'm..." she trailed off at the tense  tableau with which she was confronted.   "...ready?"</p><p>"She's not my lover, she's my <i>sensei</i>," Kuno broke in.</p><p>Ranma whapped him across the back of the head.</p><p>"Ow!  What was that  for!"</p><p>"For saying something inappropriate," Ranma replied dryly.</p><p>Kuno observed the shade of red currently decorating Soun's  face and sighed.  "You didn't tell  him.  How was I supposed to know?"</p><p>"Oh wow, this is <i>great</i>," Nabiki murmured to  herself.  "Where's the tape recorder  when you need it?"</p><p>"Daddy, I can explain," Akane said quickly.  "Ranma and I thought it might be a good time  to reopen the dojo – that is, if it's okay with you.  We only asked two people if they might be interested.  We thought... maybe..."  She offered up wide eyes and a trembling  lower lip.</p><p>Soun shook his head.   "Akane, how could you even consider asking students to the dojo without  my permission, much less consider asking them to train under you?"</p><p>"It's my fault," Ranma broke in.  "I asked Hikaru and Tatewaki, not Akane."</p><p>Soun paused.  "Well,  there's no use sending them away now, is there?  For now,  Akane, you two  are not training anyone – you are simply practicing with fellow students of the  art.  Do you understand?"</p><p>Akane looked chastened.   "Yes, daddy."</p><p>Soun turned to the redhead.   "Ranma?"</p><p>"Yes, uh..."  Ranma  blushed as she attempted to search her mental databanks for something to call  the man.  She frowned.  "Er, yes, I understand."</p><p>Soun's lips quirked and he shrugged.  "Well, son," he said to Kuno, bowing  formally, "welcome to Tendo-Saotome Anything Goes."</p><p>Ranma moved to put her nurse's apron on immediately.  Even though she'd already told Tofu-sensei  that she didn't like it, he'd insisted, saying that not only did her street  clothes appear unprofessional, but that he wouldn't want them to get spattered  with blood.</p><p>Despite the ruffles, his words had managed to change her  mind immediately.</p><p>"Ranma!"  Doctor Tofu  moved into the back room where Ranma was finishing tying the apron's bow at the  small of her back.  "How are the  Tendos?"</p><p>"Uhm... they're fine, sir.   Akane's good, Nabiki seems cheerful... Kasumi seems really keen on my  finding a boyfriend..."</p><p>"K-K..."</p><p>"Uhm, doctor?"  Ranma  hadn't known that Tofu's little fits could be brought on by Kasumi's <i>name</i>.  It was just too much!  She backed away quietly as he twitched.  "Doctor?"</p><p>"Hm?"  The doctor  finally began to realize where he was again.   "Oh yes!  I came in here to tell  you we've got our work cut out for us today and I may need you to stay  late.  If that isn't a problem?"</p><p>"Uhm... I have an engagement, but I'll stay as late as I  can."</p><p>"Fair enough," the doctor replied with a smile.  "You're going to get to do some actual  medicine here today, Ranma.  We've got a  lot of patients because of a stomach virus that's going around.  In fact, I'd like you to move Mr. Hibiki to  the back room, please.  He's asleep  again, and doesn't need any immediate treatment."</p><p>"Again?  He woke  up?"</p><p>Tofu nodded.   "Briefly and deliriously.  He's  pulling through, Ranma, but it's a tough fight.  Just wheel his cot back, if you please."</p><p>She nodded and, tightening her apron with a determined  expression, set to work.</p><p>The influx of patients wasn't rapid, but it was steady  enough to keep Ranma extremely busy.  It  seemed that just as Tofu released a patient, a new one would take his  place.  The doctor would check the  patient's tongue and ears, take his temperature, and hand out a prescription  for an antibiotic.  After the sixth  patient thanked the pair and moved to go, Ranma probably could have done Tofu's  routine herself.</p><p>Every now and then she would check on Ryoga, although his  condition seemed pretty stable and he didn't have much of a fever anymore.  He turned and mumbled once in awhile, but  other than the occasional nightmare he appeared to be much better than the day  before.</p><p>One little kid, overtaken by the virus and without much  control, threw up all over everything.   Repeatedly.  The redhead scrubbed  and held her breath.</p><p>Once in the day, Ranma changed Ryoga's bandages—an  unpleasant but necessary task.  The  black had receded to a small spot the size of a quarter, and the redness that  surrounded it had shrunk to the size of her palm.  The girl nodded, satisfied, applying more antiseptic cream and  new gauze.  Ryoga really did have the  healing abilities of a high-caliber martial artist.</p><p>Martial arts!   Ranma's eyes flew to the clock and she felt a sinking sensation surround  her stomach as she realized she'd missed Hikaru's training session.</p><p>At least Akane had probably been there to do it for  her.  In fact, she'd probably still been  helping Kuno when Hikaru arrived.  Thank  goodness for small favors.  She'd simply  let the time get away from her.</p><p>Immediately Ranma moved to her desk and picked up the  phone.  "Hey, Nabiki.  Is Akane there?"</p><p>Nabiki's caustic voice sounded on the other end of the  line.  "Boy are you in trouble,  Saotome."</p><p>"Heh.  I know that, I  know that.  Things are really crazy over  here at the clinic."</p><p>"Just a sec and I'll get my sister."</p><p>Ranma waited, the sinking sensation in her stomach getting  worse with every passing moment.  She  found herself tapping her foot.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>"Hiya Akane," Ranma said, her tone of voice telling of her  shame and apology already.  "I'm really  sorry I didn't make it.  Everyone's  getting this stomach virus and I was stuck here—I didn't even realize how much  time had passed."</p><p>"Well..."  Akane's  voice trailed off.  "It was kind of a disaster,  Ranma."</p><p>"What?  Why?"</p><p>"I couldn't get Hikaru to do what I wanted him to, and then  he and Kuno got in a fight about it."</p><p>"<i>Hikaru</i> wouldn't do what <i>you</i> wanted him to?"  Ranma demanded incredulously.</p><p>"Maybe couldn't," Akane admitted, sounding nervous.  "Maybe I went too fast?"</p><p>Ranma grimaced.  She  had really wanted this to work out; beyond her desire to practice martial arts  and pass those skills on to others, she had really wanted to help Hikaru.  He seemed like he could be a really nice guy  if he just let his guard down once in awhile.   The sinking sensation seemed to drag her through several sheets of  bedrock.</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>"Sorry, thinking.   It's okay, Akane.  We'll just try  again tomorrow, all right?  It's really  all my fault.  I'll be there next time,  I swear."</p><p>"No, it was my fault.   Daddy wasn't upset, if that's any consolation."</p><p>Ranma sighed in relief.   "Great, but—"</p><p>A crash sounded from the back room.</p><p>"Listen, Akane, I've got to go.  I think Ryoga's actually awake!   I'll talk later."  She hung up  the phone, hoping Akane wouldn't be offended by her haste.  "Doc!" she called.  "Our patient's up!"</p><p>Ranma jogged to the door and opened it.</p><p>What she saw almost shocked her to inaction.</p><p>Two figures struggled in the darkness: Ryoga, and what was obviously  a female.  Ryoga was losing badly,  greatly weakened by his injury; the other figure in the darkened room was  taking advantage of this fact.  As Ranma  blinked in sheer incredulity and denial of the scene before her, the female  figure punched Ryoga right in his wounded ribs.</p><p>The boy let out a truly agonized scream and staggered back,  clutching his wound with one hand.</p><p>Ranma finally re-gathered her sense and switched on the  light.  Both combatants turned to stare  at her.</p><p>Ryoga's eyes were wild and unreasoning, bestial almost, and  for a moment Ranma thought he was going to rush <i>her</i> simply from the look  in his eyes.  The other figure was...</p><p>"It's you!" Ranma exclaimed.  "The Amazon!"</p><p>Shampoo's eyes narrowed and she smiled, apparently  overwhelmed by her own luck.  "Ranma,"  she announced, flipping the sai in her hands.   "Good to see."</p><p>"Shit," the redhead announced.</p><p>"Ranma, what is it?   He's awa..."  Doctor Tofu trailed  off as he viewed the situation.   Stepping in front of Ranma, he spoke to the purple-haired girl.  "You are not welcome here, miss.  I suggest you leave."</p><p>Shampoo probably didn't understand him, but she caught the  implied threat anyway.  She laughed, a  high, crystal clear sound, like crushed glass.   She beckoned to the doctor.</p><p>With a sudden lunge that took both Ranma and the doctor by  surprise, Shampoo stabbed at Ryoga with her sai.  Ryoga, who had not been staring at the doctor as Shampoo had, was  ready for her, and dodged.</p><p>Tofu-sensei moved to intercept the Juketsuzoku maiden, his eyes  hard.</p><p>"Ryoga, get behind me!" Ranma ordered, placing herself  between Shampoo and her patient.</p><p>The Chinese girl's eyes narrowed as she stared at Ranma, her  lip curling in disgust.  "Kachu Tenshin  Amaguriken!" she exclaimed suddenly.</p><p>Ranma fell back, the air pushed abruptly out of her lungs,  as if Shampoo had his her hundreds of times, rather than just once.  She dropped to her knees, coughing and  gasping.</p><p>All of a sudden, Shampoo slumped, her eyes rolling into the  back of her head.</p><p>Tofu Ono was revealed as she fell, his hand still rigid from  the final strike.  He blinked down at  the girl's sleeping form, the only one left on his feet.  "Are you all right, Ranma?  Ryoga?"</p><p>A smile appeared to be deciding whether or not it had any  business on Ranma's face.  She'd never  been saved by anyone before.  With a  self-depreciating shrug, the redhead took Tofu's hand and pulled herself to her  feet.  "I'm fine," she replied.  "Just had the wind knocked out of me."</p><p>"Ryoga?" Tofu queried.</p><p>Ryoga stood with the help of his cot, pulling himself to his  feet.  "Uh—this may seem like a sort of  weird question, but... uh, how do you two know my name?  And   where am I?"</p><p>"You don't recognize Ranma, here?" Tofu queried.  "She said she knew you from junior high."</p><p>The redhead winced, but managed to smile at Ryoga in a  pained sort of way anyway.  What she'd  been fearing had happened—about ten minutes after Ryoga had woken up.</p><p>"But that's impossible," Ryoga predictably replied.  "I went to an all-boy's junior high."</p><p>Tofu blinked, watching as Ranma colored.  "Oh.   Oh!" the doctor suddenly exclaimed.   "I didn't mean to embarrass you or anything, dear," he announced to  Ranma.  He put a gentle hand on her  shoulder.  "I didn't realize."</p><p>"Realize what?" Ryoga demanded.</p><p>"Well, Ranma here has been raised as a boy," Tofu  replied.  "Everyone must have thought  she <i>was</i> a boy, at the time.  She  must have been enrolled in school as a boy as well."</p><p>"Huh?" Ryoga demanded.   "A boy?  Why..."  Suddenly, it seemed like he'd frozen  solid.  "Ran-ma...?" he queried.  He peered at the redhead with new eyes.  "Ranma <i>Saotome</i>?"</p><p>Tofu nodded, patting the redhead on the back.  "See?   There's no need to be so nervous, Ranma.  I'm sure that Ryoga here doesn't mind that you're a girl."</p><p>Ranma just continued to stare at her feet.  "Eh..." she finally managed to murmur.</p><p>Ryoga mumbled something under his breath that sounded like a  curse.  He looked extremely confused,  and the redhead didn't exactly blame him.   If she'd suddenly found out Ukyo was a girl or something, she'd be blown  away.</p><p>"You should feel very lucky that your friend Ranma found you  at all," Tofu added helpfully, not seeming to notice the silence of the two  teenagers.  "She and Akane pulled you  out from underneath a bush in Nerima Public Park.  Without the two of them, and the other Tendo sisters, you'd  almost certainly be dead by now."</p><p>Ryoga's expression, if anything, fell even more.  "You mean—Ranma saved my life?"</p><p>"It wasn't anything like <i>that</i>," Ranma assured the  floor tiles.  "The other girls did way  more than me, I just sat there kind of uselessly, waiting for the doctor."</p><p>"And changed Ryoga's bandages every day as well, Ranma;  don't forget that."  The doctor turned  to address Ryoga.  "Shortly after that,  Ranma became my assistant, and she's tended to you very faithfully."</p><p>Ranma frowned.  "Doc,  you're making it sound like—"</p><p>"You did?"  Ryoga was  staring at Ranma with an almost painful amount of disbelief etched across his  features.</p><p>"You have a problem with that?" Ranma demanded, one eyebrow  raised, her voice cool.</p><p>"Now the question is, what do we do with <i>her</i>?" Tofu  queried, nudging Shampoo with one foot.</p><p>Ranma blinked, almost having forgotten her would-be  murderer.  A very stupid thing to do,  she decided.  "She's probably here without  a passport, not to mention the fact that she hurt Ryoga," the redhead  proclaimed.  "We could probably have her  deported."</p><p>Tofu looked at the sleeping purple-haired girl in pity.  "I wonder why she came all this way."</p><p>Ranma for her part had no compunctions about seeing the  Juketsuzoku warrior as a common criminal.   She knew the girl to be a fierce hunter who had stalked her across the  greater part of China, and all for no easily discernible reason.  Of course, the girl's honor had been  slightly besmirched by being so easily defeated, but that was no reason to  murder somebody!  It had been a friendly  match, after all—or so Ranma had thought at the time.</p><p>Ryoga moved to gingerly lower himself to the edge of his  cot, hissing in pain.  "A girl," he  mumbled to himself in a low voice.  He  snuck a glance at Ranma from under his lashes, quick but scanning, and Ranma  knew he wasn't lamenting over being beaten by Shampoo.</p><p>"Eh heh," Ranma tittered nervously.  "We should tie her up, don't you  think?"  She moved to the closet where  Tofu kept supplies for repair and found a length of nylon cording.  In moments, Shampoo was tied to one of the  large benches in Tofu's main office.</p><p>The doctor released the pressure point, waking the Amazonian  maiden.  For a moment, Shampoo seemed  startled, confused.  She thrashed wildly  before Tofu's soft voice calmed her.  He  knelt next to her and began speaking, trying out different dialects of Chinese.</p><p>While Ranma paid as close attention to their hushed  conversation as she could, trying to catch the occasional word or phrase, Ryoga  seemed to be attempting to light the redhead on fire with his gaze.  "What?" she demanded, but Ryoga turned  away.</p><p>Tofu-sensei stood.   "Ranma, would you call the police, please?"  His face was very pale.</p><p>"Y-yeah," she stammered in reply, and strode over to her  desk in the waiting room.</p><p>Shampoo looked at the Ranma, then Ryoga, and trilled  something that sounded question-like.   Tofu responded, sighing, his hands rubbing his temples.</p><p>"What is it?" Ryoga demanded nervously.</p><p>"I don't like what I've just heard.  There are three important pieces of news  here, and none of them are particularly sunshine and roses."</p><p>Shampoo was staring at Ryoga, a curious look in her  eyes.  Tofu kept a close watch on  her.</p><p>"This girl here—Shan Pu—wishes to <i>kill</i> Ranma.  If an outsider female defeats her, she is  required to kill her.  By law.  That or some other things that Shampoo  didn't appear to want to get into.   Apparently death is the most honorable thing you can do, not just for  yourself but for the person who defeated you."</p><p>The redhead sighed upon her return, running her hands  through her hair.  "I heard that.  As in... the other option is a fate <i>worse</i>  than death?  That is what you're saying,  isn't it, doc?"</p><p>Tofu attempted to smile, but what ended up happening was  that one side of his lip twitched, like he had a nervous tic.</p><p>"Lots of people out to kill you," Ryoga murmured to himself,  running one hand distractedly through his hair.</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>Ryoga lifted his head, startled.  "Did I say something?"</p><p>The redhead's jaw firmed as she turned back to the  doctor.  "What else?"</p><p>"There seems to be a... problem.. with Ryoga's injury," Tofu  said.</p><p>"What kind of problem?" Ryoga demanded.  "I'm not going to die or anything, am I?"  He laughed nervously.</p><p>And Shampoo, knowing the word 'die' very well, since she'd  practiced saying it in Japanese, looked up from her scrutiny of Ryoga and  nodded cheerfully.</p><p>Author's Notes:   Whoo!  This was a difficult  chapter to put together.  A great deal  of it ended up being cut, and as a result, I combined chapters five and six to  make the length fit.  Originally, there  was a cute, quirky little scene with Hikaru's training (at school, in the gym)  but it really didn't fit with the rest of the story I was going for.</p><p>Yes, I know that Tofu says that there are three pieces of  news and only informs Ranma and Ryoga about two of them.  He's keeping the last piece to himself for  now.</p><p>I also know that what Shampoo has told Tofu is a  contradiction of what she learned from Genma.   She obviously knows that Ranma is a boy, and therefore she needs must  marry him rather than kill him.  But <i>she</i>  is keeping that to herself.  ;)</p><p>Are you actually beginning to like Kuno at this point?  He's been my favorite character to write in  this series.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>[1] "Crap!  Do you know where (we are)?"  The 'crap' is in surprise, in case you  missed it.  ;)</p><p>[2] Roughly,  "that's right, she's Chinese."  More or  less what Shampoo just said to him.   (Onegai shimasu, to those of you who can actually speak this language  with any eloquence!)</p><p>[3] "Can't you  understand me?  Geez... ah, well,  there's no help for it."  Correct my  grammar... <i>please</i>!</p><p>[4] No, he is <i>not</i>  giving Shampoo the bird.  In America, we  use the middle finger to tell somebody to go and &amp;^* themselves.  In Britain, where people are apparently  more... ahem... active, they use two fingers.   In Japan, raising that finger and placing it before you can mean you are  attempting to make a point.  ;)</p><p>[5] Used to celebrate  a woman's "coming of age" i.e. menses.   I've heard it's for any kind of milestone in somebody's life, but in  most cases it seems to refer specifically to the aforementioned condition.</p><p>[6] Lord Byron, <i>She  walks in Beauty</i></p><p>[7] Ten= heaven,  do= road, path.   Well, Kuno had to make  a corny joke eventually...</p><p>[8] Luckily...</p><p>[9] Yes, this  Akane is far more kickass than is implied in the canon version.  If Kuno could overpower her, I don't think  he would have <u>let</u> her break his leg.   (Also, I do wonder what Akane's level of skill truly was at the  beginning—she seemed to be a pretty cool fighter before everyone else arrived  to show her up.)</p>
