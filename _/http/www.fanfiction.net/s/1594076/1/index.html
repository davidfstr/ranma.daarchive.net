</div><p>"Put me <i>down!</i>"</p><p>A young  girl was being carried down the street on the back of a hulk of a man.  "We'll be there soon enough," he  soothed.  "Quit struggling."</p><p>Though that did not comfort the  watching Nerimans any, indubitably you yourself, dear reader, are familiar with  this <i>scene</i>: an irate, beautiful redhead beating on an old man's  shoulder, speaking to her father in a quite uncharitable tone and using the  least respect possible without calling him names.</p><p>"Stupid old  man!"</p><p>Ah—and  there we go.  You could sing this song  in your sleep, could you not?</p><p>Boom.  "Suck on <i>that</i>, old man!"</p><p>Yes,  another day, another oft-repeated scene.</p><p>"Come on  Joi[1],"  the redhead snapped angrily, and a smallish dog, coming up to her knee at the  shoulders, scurried after her.</p><p>This will  not be a comedy.  I have decreed  it.  Needless to say, I have been wrong  before.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE: The Redhead and the Dog</p><p>Joi barked  angrily as the old man reclaimed the redheaded girl, and the three entered the  Tendo home.  A particularly successful  nip from the small animal's jaws and Ranma twisted free, breasts bouncing  unmistakably as she landed.  "Excuse  me!" she called out, bowing before the four stunned figures ahead of her.</p><p>Joi now  barked at the new people enthusiastically before scurrying behind Ranma—before  realizing that put him in front of Genma.   He quickly found a convenient corner and viewed what he was certain was  impending doom with watchful eyes.</p><p>Three girls  and an elder man who had to be their father blinked almost simultaneously.</p><p>"Er… excuse  me for intruding in your home?" Ranma attempted formally.</p><p>"Ranma?"  the man remarked intelligently.</p><p>The redhead  nodded.  "Yeesss…"</p><p>He peered  behind her.  "But Genma, you said you  had a son!"</p><p>"I said I  had <i>Ranma</i>," Genma corrected dryly, "who's hardly a man, as you can see…"</p><p>"You're  just repaying me for that black eye, you big jerk!" Ranma exclaimed angrily.</p><p>Joi  bristled and barked.  The youngest Tendo  girl smiled and knelt carefully on the floor.   He walked up to her, tail wagging, and she patted him on the head.  "Hi," she said softly.  "I'm Akane.   Want to be friends?"</p><p>Joi went  into a frenzy of tail-wagging.</p><p>"Well.  Huh, he likes you," Ranma said, smiling a  little bit.  "He usually hates new  people, doesn't he?"</p><p>The small  dog moved to the middle sister and sniffed her disinterestedly, moving on to  the eldest.  His tail wagged a bit more.</p><p>People  watched dogs the same way they watched small children, as if they existed for  nothing more than to do something adorable.   Everyone in the room was paying attention to Joi.</p><p>"I'll be,"  Ranma continued, smiling openly now.   "He usually just hides behind me!   And he hates pops."  The redhead  frowned a moment in confusion, then smiled even wider as she watched Akane  scratch the area behind Joi's ears.</p><p>"Perhaps  you and Akane can spar while Saotome-san and I talk some things over," Soun  said loudly.</p><p>Genma  nodded.  "That would be a wonderful  idea, Tendo."</p><p>"We'll see how our girls measure  up, eh?"  They laughed companionably.</p><p>The  youngest Tendo abruptly lost interest in Joi, who whined and butted her hand  with his nose.  "I really don't think—"  she began hesitantly.</p><p>"Nonsense,  Akane," Mr. Tendo continued in that same jocular tone of voice that nonetheless  broached no argument.  "There's nothing  wrong with a little sparring session, is there?"</p><p>Akane  frowned, but rose, grabbing Ranma by the wrist.  "Come on," she said roughly.</p><p>Ranma was  impressed in spite of herself.  The dojo  was beautiful, immaculately kept and shining.   A simple message was hung on the wall: 'The Fundamentals'.  A large pile of dust stood in one of the  corners, rather obviously from a recent brick-breaking, but other that that,  the place was terribly well-kept.  For a  moment, Ranma felt a shiver run through her as though she was an unwelcome  stranger on some kind of hallowed ground.</p><p>The redhead  shook that off deliberately.  She was  the best martial artist there ever was—and would not be intimidated by the  obviously rarely-used dojo of a city girl.   Still, she refused to fight women, or even spar with them.  Unless, of course, on those all-too-rare  occasions when they were out to kill her.</p><p>"I don't  fight—" she began hesitantly, but Akane broke in before she could finish.</p><p>"You don't  either?  Thank goodness!"</p><p>Ranma  blinked as Joi trotted into the dojo.   It was unlikely he was going to let Ranma out of his sight in a new  place for long.  "Huh?" the redhead  managed.  "You—I mean—"</p><p>Akane hung  her head in something like shame, and for the first time, Ranma let herself  take in how pretty she was.  "It's… I  don't like to fight at all," Akane said softly.  "I'm glad you don't want to, either."</p><p>Not <i>want</i>  to?  That was something of an alien  concept.  Why… everybody practiced,  didn't they?  There were just degrees of  skill.</p><p>Akane  appeared to notice her consternation.   "Well… I mean, I used to, obviously."   She beheld the dojo with something like disgust.  "Just not anymore.  It makes Daddy so discouraged, so I try to make like I still  fight…"</p><p>Another  foreign concept.  "You… you're doing this  'cause of your dad?"</p><p>Akane  nodded.  "So… would you really mind if  you just said we had a pretty good fight?"</p><p>Ranma  considered this, scratching her head.   Somehow it seemed sort of dishonorable or something.</p><p>"I'll say  you won," the dark-haired girl tacked on.</p><p>"It was a  draw."  Ranma didn't know she was going  to say it until it was already hanging in the air.  Maybe something in the dark-eyed girl's expression made her do  it—the Tendo girl did look pretty harried.   Joi nuzzled her with his nose, sensing her distress, and she patted him  absently.  "Since neither of us fought,  it was a draw."</p><p>Akane's  expression lit up.  "Thanks a lot," she  said.  "You're really cool."  Then she blushed, as though she thought she  had seemed a bit too enthusiastic.</p><p>Ranma was  blushing, too.  No one had ever directed  an admiring gaze to her before.  Akane  was really grateful.  "But why don't you  wanna?  Are you hurt?"  She still couldn't quite seem to understand  the other girl's position.</p><p>The  dark-haired girl winced.  "Uhm…"</p><p>There was a  long pause in which Ranma wished she hadn't said a word with every passing  second.  She hadn't known that being  with somebody could be this awkward.   Her only experiences with other beings had mostly been with Joi, who  protected her as best as his cowardly nature would allow, and Genma, whose sole  wish seemed to be to meld his son into a top-notch martial artist—unless you  counted his seemingly insatiable desire for food and drink.[2]  In neither experience was there room for  much of this kind of delicate conversation.   Ranma was searching for another topic of conversation other than martial  arts—and coming up alarmingly blank—when Akane finally responded.</p><p>"I hurt  someone else.  Nobody thinks it's a big  deal but me.  It was this guy I go to school  with," she continued, her hands patting Joi still, beginning to go a bit more  quickly from nervousness.  "He was  always bugging me about dates and stuff."</p><p>Ranma  blinked.  "Bugging you?"</p><p>Akane  seemed to realize she had an audience all over again.  "I didn't like him, much.   He was kind of conceited, real full of himself.  He made me very angry, always assuming I  wanted him; he even got a lot of other guys interested in me, the way he  talked."  She shivered and a look of  revulsion crossed her pretty features.   "I'd always been really good at martial arts," she added sadly, as  though this was a truly terrible thing.   "Took to it kind of naturally.   I'll show you some trophies later."   She said this with the air of somebody announcing they were going to visit  the grave of a loved one.  "This one  time he just plain annoyed me too much.   He tried to grab me."  Akane  closed her eyes, as if she were forcing herself to see it all over again.  "I broke his arm and his leg."</p><p>The redhead  sighed, still not quite understanding.   Akane had overestimated her opponent, that was all.  Ranma had done it before.</p><p>The other  girl's eyes shimmered, though she didn't let any tears drop.  "The sound," she announced, as though that  said it all, "of bone <i>cracking</i>.   It's something else, you know?   After that, I didn't really have the same taste for it anymore, martial  arts."  She wound down, her breathing  slightly heavier than normal, like a panicked animal's.  Joi was being patient with her, even though  she had a hand tightening on his fur in what had to be a painful way.  Akane's eyes met hers.  "You ever hurt someone really bad?"</p><p>Ranma  considered.  Oddly, she had not.  "I've been hurt bad," she replied.</p><p>Akane shook  her head, then shrugged.  "Anyway,  Nabiki—that's my middle sister—she just thinks old Kuno got what he  deserved.  And Kasumi, my other sister,  just said it wasn't very ladylike to fight in school."  She snorted, to show what she thought of <i>that</i>.  "Daddy was… proud.  Nobody was upset but me, and if I try to show it, they just all  get impatient.  It almost feels like I'm  nothing but a means to an end—just a way to carry on the Tendo School."</p><p>It all  snapped into place in Ranma's brain almost audibly, like gears shifting in a  lock.  "I know what you mean," she  said.  At times, Ranma had wondered  whether her father would have cared if she were any different, provided she  could still fight.  The answer was  somewhat scary, especially when Ranma considered the Catfist.  Ranma could have died, or gone permanently  insane; but Genma was ready to risk him on the altar of the martial arts he  seemed to love more than his own flesh and blood.  The redhead felt a deep pang and hung her head.</p><p>"You don't  want to fight, either, then," Akane confirmed.</p><p>"I just  don't fight…" she fumbled.  <i>Girls,</i>  she thought.  "…unless it's serious."</p><p>"Well,  yeah," Akane replied.  "If my family was  in danger, I'd fight 'til the end."  Her  eyes sparked briefly.  "But for <i>fun</i>—or  to show some guy you're bigger and stronger—it's just bullying.  And that's weak.[3]"</p><p>The redhead  considered this, trying to incorporate yet another almost dizzying piece of  thought into her framework.  "I guess…"</p><p>Akane waved  her hands in a friendly manner.  "Oh—I  don't want to make you feel like you have to agree!  I'm just saying what I think… but maybe I do that a bit too much  sometimes.  I hope I haven't bored you  or anything…"</p><p>Ranma shook  her head quickly.  "No way!"  She considered, then added a smile.  "You're cool, too, Akane.  Even if we think different on some things."</p><p>The other  girl smiled widely, pleased.  "Do you  want to be friends?" she inquired.</p><p>Ranma  gulped at Akane's open, disarming expression, and smiled.  "Uh… it's been awhile since I've had one…  I've been on the road… and I don't know how to…"</p><p>Akane  looked mildly surprised.</p><p>"And  friends are supposed to tell each other… everything.  Right?"</p><p>The  youngest Tendo paused.  "Well, most  stuff anyway," she replied.  "But if you  wanna wait and tell me later, or think about it," she began.</p><p>"No," Ranma  cut in abruptly.  "I, ah, don't wanna  make you mad."</p><p>Akane's  eyes shimmered.</p><p>"No!  I don't mean 'cause of what you said, I just  mean I don't wanna make you upset… see?   I'm terrible at this!"</p><p>Akane shook  her head.  "Maybe Nabiki's right—I'm too  sensitive."  She sniffed.  "Well, we girls have to stick together, you  know—so out with it."</p><p>"Eh heh…  well, it's kinda about that…"</p><p>"Tomboys?  Emotions?"</p><p>"Girls."</p><p>Akane  nodded.  "Yeessss?" she drawled.</p><p>"I'm not  one."</p><p>Akane  blinked at Ranma, double-checked the redhead's chest to be absolutely certain,  and made her way back to Ranma's blue eyes.   The entire time, her bland expression did not alter.</p><p>Then she  began to laugh hysterically.[4]</p><p>"Hey—hey!"  Ranma protested while the other girl giggled helplessly. "I'm serious!"</p><p>Akane's chortles  died down and an air of seriousness settled over her almost abruptly.  "Listen, Ranma, I know how you feel there,  too… but we're martial artists, not <i>guys</i>—and just because we can fight  well doesn't mean that we're any less female.   Plenty of guys have characteristics that are considered traditionally  female, and it goes the opposite way, too…"</p><p>But Ranma  was shaking her head, taken by the incongruity and absurdity of the  situation.  She'd never thought she  would ever be trying to have to convince anyone she was male, and she didn't  think anyone would have as small a chance of success as she did just now.  She knew she could get up and grab some hot  water from the kitchen and watch Akane's indulgent smile slip right off of her  features, but something in that scenario disturbed the redhead.  It would mean getting up, for one thing, and  she found herself awfully comfortable sitting cross-legged on the dojo floor  with Akane, in more ways than one.   "That's not what I mean," she replied.</p><p>"Then what <i>do</i>  you mean?" Akane demanded.</p><p>The redhead  took a deep breath.  "I mean I'm a  guy.  Honestly."</p><p>"Okay, so  you're honestly a guy.  Want to get  married after all?"</p><p>She was <i>humoring  </i>her!  A brief aura flared around  Ranma's female form before she pulled it under her control.  "I'm being <i>serious</i>!" she  exclaimed.  "And you're making fun of  me!"</p><p>"Okay,  okay; I'm sorry," Akane replied nervously.   "I believe you."</p><p>They  blinked at one another for a moment.   For some reason, Ranma felt her lips twitching into a smile, but maybe  that was because Akane was smiling, too.   Joi laid his head down on his paws, looking up benignly at the two of  them.  And then they were grinning, and  then they were laughing almost uncontrollably, hanging onto one another.  "Okay… so it <i>sounds</i> like I'm nuts,"  Ranma finally wheezed.  "But I swear…"</p><p>"I know, I  know.  And I said that I believe  you.  So you're a guy."</p><p>And she  did.  Ranma viewed her.  She was willing to take Ranma on faith.  Her eyes were not condescending, even though  they were slightly doubtful.  If Ranma  wanted, Akane would indubitably call her 'he'.   She had no idea what to say.   "Th-thank you."</p><p>"This is  enough time for at least three sparring matches," Akane announced  suddenly.  "Let's go back inside, okay?"</p><p>Ranma  nodded and stood.  "Three bouts.  You won the first one, I won the second one,  and then we tied."</p><p>"Thanks for  telling me your secret," Akane said softly, slipping an arm around Ranma's  shoulders in a half-hug.</p><p>A dozen  emotions warred in Ranma at once.  A  long-suppressed part of her wanted to kiss the youngest Tendo girl, but that  was buried so deep it hardly had a voice.   A surprisingly strong part of her wanted to lean into the embrace,  however—and an almost equally intense need to push her away made itself felt as  well.  A mind-numbing confusion was  threatening to kick all the other emotions out on their asses; no one had  touched Ranma in a friendly manner since Ucchan used to hold his hand way back  when.  (He did not really remember the  nice old lady who had originally eased him out of the cat-fist.)</p><p>"You're  trembling—are you cold?" Akane inquired solicitously as they strode to the dojo  door.</p><p>Ranma  nodded slightly, and Akane responded to the other girl's unspoken wish by  drawing her closer.  Ranma's confusion  escalated to the point where she actually wondered if she might pass out.</p><p>Perhaps  unfortunately, Ranma wasn't made that way.   Her brain continued to function quite actively, though it was becoming a  bit hazy from endorphins.  At least  she'd managed to stop shaking—how embarrassing!  If pop saw her like this—</p><p>That put a  bit of steel in her spine.  She couldn't  think of a way to shrug Akane off without hurting her feelings, though, so the  pair continued to walk to the house as they were, Ranma nearly blushing hard  enough to set the taller girl's shirt ablaze.   The arm draped loosely over her shoulders began to feel like a red-hot  brand; Ranma could not get away, and soon everybody would <i>see</i>…</p><p>The pair  slipped inside the house, and Akane removed her arm casually.  "Good fight," she added.</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ranma added loudly.  "Uh, very good."</p><p>"But who  won?" Soun demanded.  Genma viewed the  close proximity of the pair warily, although nobody else seemed to think it was  odd.  Ranma carefully stepped a bit to  the side.</p><p>"It was a  tie," Akane replied.  "Ranma, want some  soda, or some water?  I'll bet you're  thirsty after all of that."</p><p>"Thirsty?  Yeah, er, real thirsty."  The redhead considered.  "Anything cold."</p><p>Engrossed  in their play-acting, neither girl noticed Genma's face turning an interesting  shade of puce.  "WHAT?" he exploded,  startling Akane into dropping her can of soda all over the floor.   "YOU WERE BEATEN BY A GIRL?"[5]</p><p>Akane's  gaze flickered to Ranma speculatively for a bare instant before it turned on  Genma in a cold fury.  "I didn't beat  him, we tied."  Her voice was  deceptively soft, and her eyes were lethal.   Suddenly Ranma began to see how this girl might have gotten angry enough  to break bones; watching the muscles cord in her right arm as she clenched her  fists in anger, Ranma could also see that she could probably manage it  casually.  For all of this, Ranma  managed to miss Akane's pronoun.</p><p>"Yeah pops,  don't get all tied up in knots.  Akane  is…"  Ranma coughed.  "…real good.  Amazing, really.  A natural.  I was…"   she coughed again.   "…Hard-pressed."</p><p>"Hard-pressed!"  Genma exclaimed again, quieter but more angry.   "You were hard-pressed after I took you through China, risking my life  and your own to gain both experience and ancient technique… and you <i>lose</i>…  to a <i>Tokyo GIRL</i>?"</p><p>Soun had a  hand on his old friend's arm.  "Come  now, Saotome.  Akane was always amazing  at martial arts as a child; barely had to teach it to her.  Just because she and your girl are of a  level—"</p><p>"They  wouldn't be of a level if Ranma had some hot water," Genma breathed.  "Kasumi—would you mind heating up some water  for tea?"</p><p>The eldest  Tendo daughter moved into the kitchen.</p><p>"Hot  water?" Soun demanded.</p><p>"Yes—I'm  afraid the time has come to tell you of Ranma's true tragic story…"</p><p>Ranma  paled, suddenly feeling panic approaching.   "Pops, I don't think that—"</p><p>"… when we  were in the wilds of China, something terrible happened…"  He shook his head as though sadly  disappointed at the hand that fate had dealt him.  "Perhaps you should call in Nabiki as well…"</p><p>Ranma felt  Akane slipping away from her.  She  remembered the look of half-terror half-hatred that had crossed Akane's  features when she talked about Kuno and the boys that liked her at school.  And her pops was going to make Akane look at  <i>her</i> like that.  She needed to  stop it all, somehow.</p><p>Ranma felt  bone-weary.  She just wanted to stay in  one place for more than a moment or two, maybe make some friends.  She remembered with tired fondness her very  early childhood and then her full year of junior high, when she'd had time to  make friends and go to school.  Those  were her happiest times; she wanted a happy time again.  Akane liked her.  If Ranma could manage to keep her trust, then things would  somehow be okay, she knew it.  "Pops,  why don't you get Nabiki?" Ranma queried.   "I think I saw her go upstairs."</p><p>Genma eyed  his child warily, while Ranma returned the look coolly.  She tried to look like she wanted to get it  all over with, like she wanted her curse out in the open.  Finally, the old martial artist lumbered  away.</p><p>Ranma was  not the child of Saotome Genma for nothing.   Her mind had whipped up a relatively cunning and underhanded plan at a  speed that startled even her.  She  sniffled.  "Mister Tendo, I'm so sorry  about this," she said sadly.</p><p>"About…  pardon?"</p><p>Ranma  winked at Akane out of the corner of her eye.   "It's just that I'm sorry I'm not a boy for you and your family.  It's just too bad we're all girls.  And poor pops…"</p><p>Akane  stared at him.  "What's wrong with your  father?"</p><p>"Well, you  heard what he thinks of girls.  He  raised me as a boy and now he…" she paused.   "Seems to think I <i>am</i> one."   Ranma gulped, hoping she wasn't going to get herself murdered and  wondering what was possessing her.   Akane's arm on her shoulder...   "I wouldn't be surprised if he still wants to marry me to one of your  daughters."</p><p>Soun gaped.</p><p>"I've been  trying to get a chance to tell you about it, but—"</p><p>A sound on  the stairs halted all conversation abruptly as Genma returned with Nabiki in  tow.</p><p>"This had  better be good," she said lazily.   "You're interrupting my stock purchases."</p><p>Genma  nodded, and launched into the tragic tale of Jhusenkyo, complete with the  faulty guidebook and the way Ranma's curse was activated.  "Luckily I avoided becoming cursed," he  finished quietly, melodramatic tears streaming down his face.</p><p>For a long  time, there was silence.  Ranma sat  still, looking dejectedly at the pattern on the tabletop.  Then she sighed—a sigh that spoke volumes.</p><p>"Well old  friend," Soun said consolingly.  "That's  really too bad."</p><p>"I just  want a normal life," Ranma said suddenly.   Her eyes blinked rapidly.  She  hadn't realized how true this was until she'd said so.</p><p>Soun's eyes  filled with sympathy.  The poor girl had  to deal with her deranged father, out on the road, him treating her like a boy  the whole time… when she only wanted to go to parties and date boys like all  normal girls did!</p><p>Except his  Akane-chan, of course.</p><p>"You can  stay here as long as you like," Soun announced paternally.</p><p>"Father!"  Kasumi exclaimed, surprised and pleased.</p><p>"Daddy!"  Nabiki added, surprised and less pleased.</p><p>"Yatta!"  Akane exclaimed, not surprised in the slightest.</p><p>Ranma  smirked.  <i>Ha!  Suck on that, you old schemer!  Now we won't be wandering the globe anymore…</i></p><p>"That's  perfect," Genma replied, causing Ranma to blink in wary surprise.  "Kasumi, dear, would you mind getting that  tea water?"</p><p>"I'll get  it," Akane said.  She went into the  kitchen and emerged carrying the kettle with a potholder.  "Who wants tea?"</p><p>With a  sudden motion, Genma poured the tea water over his child's head.</p><p>There was  absolute silence.  Ranma closed her eyes  awaiting the change… waiting for Akane's eyes to turn cold on him…</p><p>Cold.  Ranma blinked.</p><p>"What did  you do that for?" Akane demanded.  "I  wanted tea!  And now Ranma is <i>soaking  wet!</i>"</p><p>Ranma  looked down.  Soaking wet… and  female.  Akane put cold water in the  teapot.  Akane put <i>cold water</i> in  the…</p><p>Genma  sputtered blankly for a moment, then passed out.</p><p>"I need a  bath," Ranma said wearily.</p><p>"Me too,"  Akane added calmly, as though old martial artists passed out on her floor every  day of the week.  The pair disappeared  up the stairs.</p><p>"Poor  Ranma!" Kasumi breathed.  Nabiki could  only nod in wonderment.</p><p>When they  reached the top of the steps, Ranma realized she was going to have to say  something <i>now</i>.  There was no way  she could say she had some kind of pathological fear of hot water or anything  at this point; besides which, Akane seemed to really believe her.  "You switched the water," Ranma said softly  on the landing.</p><p>Akane  nodded.  "Why'd you lie to my folks?"</p><p>Ranma  almost flinched at the way she put it; Joi trotted up the stairs behind her,  Ranma's ever-present shadow, and looked up at the redhead as though awaiting  her answer.  "Let's talk about it  inside, okay?"  The fact that Akane was  ready to side with Ranma in tricking her own family either said a lot about  Ranma or a lot about Akane's relationship with her family—Ranma wanted to know  which.  Maybe it was both.</p><p>Akane  nodded, and they entered a modestly large bath.  Joi whined, but stayed behind, hating bathrooms ever since he'd  been washed and shampooed in one by an enthusiastic younger Ranma.</p><p>"First of  all…"  Ranma turned the furo onto its  hottest; it only took a couple of moments until the water was warm enough for  Ranma to transform.  A splash later and  a tall, dark-haired boy stood where a tiny buxom redhead had been.  Ranma kept his eyes closed for a moment as  thoughts and impressions swirled around him confusingly.  Briefly, dizziness assaulted him—which had  never happened before.</p><p>When he  opened his eyes, Akane was staring at him frankly, a blue aura flickering on  and off around her tense figure.  Steam  was slowly filling the room; and the sound of the still-running hot water filled  Ranma's ears.  Suddenly he had the  feeling she was going to hit him.</p><p>Instead,  she approached, examining him even more minutely.  Her blue aura flickered out entirely, and her gaze became frank  and appraising.  Deft fingers moved  Ranma's damp hair away from his eyes and she peered unabashedly into them.  "Gosh," she breathed.  "It really is you, after all!"[6]</p><p>Ranma let  out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.  "Yeah," he replied.  He  smiled tentatively.</p><p>"Weird,"  Akane opined, poking at his chest, briefly, then drawing her finger away as  though it had been stung.  "Where'd they  go?"</p><p>Ranma  blushed, then chuckled, taken by the sincerity and oddity of the question.  "Don't ask me."</p><p>"And if you  did the same thing with cold water…"</p><p>Ranma  turned the cool faucet on in the sink and dunked his head under the running  water.  Abruptly he shrunk a foot, his  hair flared to scarlet life, and his bosoms expanded under his shirt.</p><p>Akane  blinked again, then smiled wonderingly.   "So you're really a guy, though?"</p><p>Ranma was  taken aback by the question.  "Like I  said," he replied gruffly.</p><p>"Ah."  Akane's voice was still oddly  appreciative.  "But you're gonna stay a  girl while you're with us?"</p><p>Ranma  paused, letting that sink in while the steam thickened around them.  "I guess… now I've put pops in the hot spot,  anyway."</p><p>Akane's  features suddenly became serious.  "Then  there's some stuff we're going to have to discuss."</p><p>While the  furo filled, Akane rose and locked the door.</p><p>Ranma  became abruptly aware of her position: alone in the bath with a lovely girl  whom she was coming to like very much.   Her face heated, but she prayed Akane would think it was the steam.  "What?" she inquired, surprised to find that  her voice had leapt an octave higher than her usual contralto.</p><p>Akane  seated herself on the bench usually reserved for washing.  Ranma seated herself cautiously on the edge  of the furo.  "How much do you know  about girls?"</p><p>Ranma  blinked—not what she was expecting.   "Oh!  Well, I can act like a  girl, it's easy, you just make your eyes big and—"</p><p>"No, no,"  Akane said—thankfully, before Ranma could complete the beginning of an enormous  faux pas.  "I mean… what do you know  about <i>being </i>one?"</p><p>The redhead  considered this.  "Are there…"  She paused and cleared her throat.  "Is there some kind of secret stuff about  being a girl?"</p><p>Akane's  eyes flickered, and Ranma wondered if she was suppressing a giggle; but Ranma's  question was genuine.  She didn't know  anything about girlhood except the rough samples of men's behavior towards her  new form; as far as she knew, all guys were perverts and wanted some—except she  herself, of course—and she could therefore get any guy to do whatever she  wanted if she pouted enough or showed enough leg.  That was about it.[7]</p><p>The  youngest Tendo shook her head finally.   "There's nothing quite secret about it—you can find it in any health  book."</p><p>Ranma  froze, a rogue thought taking hold of her mind.  "Akane… you can't think… I'd never get pregnant… I'm not that  type of—"[8]</p><p>"Not what I  meant!" Akane exclaimed, though there was something like relief in her  eyes.  "Ranma—do you know how a girl <i>becomes</i>  pregnant?"</p><p>"Well of  course I do!"  Ranma had a vaguer idea  than most, but sensed that Akane was absolutely certain on this point and that  she should appear to be as well.</p><p>The dark  haired girl put her head in her hands.   Wordlessly, she rose, opened the cabinet under her sink, and withdrew  'feminine products'.  Just as silently,  she handed them to Ranma.</p><p>The redhead  examined them for a moment.  "What are these?"</p><p>Akane's  left eye twitched; it was obvious she was going to have to be more  explicit.  "Ranma, do you know what a  period is?"</p><p>That did  it.  The other girl paled even further  than her milk-white complexion allowed; her blue eyes darted from Akane to the  package in her hands, which suddenly dropped from nerveless fingers.  She shook her head and mouthed something  that looked like 'no way'.</p><p>Akane  shrugged.  "Maybe it won't happen to  you, Ranma, but I kind of doubt that.   Your dad said you got this curse less than two months ago, right?"  Her eyes were warm and slightly pitying.</p><p>Ranma  nodded.  "R-recently," she replied  shakily, still staring at the package on the floor with the loathing and  wariness one usually reserves for poisonous vipers.</p><p>"It never  hurts to be prepared," Akane stated blandly.   "Here, watch."  Akane ripped open  a package and threw away the wrapper.   Quietly and efficiently she demonstrated its relationship to panties.</p><p>"Oh," Ranma  replied quietly.  "So if—oh."</p><p>"You tell  me if it happens, okay?  There's lots of  other stuff, but I don't want to scare you until we know for sure."</p><p>"I ain't  afraid…" Ranma's voice quavered a bit at the end.  "…much."</p><p>"Good for  you… I was terrified about mine."</p><p>Ranma  slowly took this in as Akane reached over to the nozzle of the bath and halted  the stream of water flowing into the tub.   They faced each other, Akane's features open and warm, Ranma's doubtful  and nervous, until Ranma's began to match the other girl's.  She wasn't sure how to feel, but it was hard  to look at Akane smiling and not smile back.</p><p>"Here," the  dark-haired girl said companionably.   "I'll scrub your back if you get mine—"</p><p>Ranma  froze.</p><p>Thirty  minutes later, a much paler looking Ranma-chan emerged from the bath with a  large white towel wrapped around her body, followed closely by a giggling,  blushing Akane.</p><p>Meanwhile,  Genma was wondering what, exactly, had gone wrong with his sob story.  He'd always been quite good at sob  stories—not having a natural talent for them, but rather building up his skills  as the years went on.  However, his most  recent actually true sob story had obviously fallen on deaf ears.  It was unbelievable!</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>Perhaps the  curse became permanent after a certain period of time?  Oh, his poor Ranma, to be taken from him so—</p><p>Nodoka;  kami-sama above.  With the curse  permanent, Ranma would have no reason whatsoever to be judged a man amongst <i>anything</i>.  And back at the home of the Tendos, Genma  and his son-turned-daughter had decent odds of simply running into the woman,  who lived nearby.  It was time to accept  the precept #37 of Anything Goes: <i>A Moving Target is Harder to Hit.[9]</i>  Of course, he really had meant to marry his  son off, this time—get his son off his hands and a dojo bearing his name in one  fell swoop—return to Nodoka in triumph, perhaps the only way she would ever  have him.  But desperate times called  for desperate measures, of course.</p><p>Genma  stood, the gleam in his eyes signifying incipient action, one fist clasped to  his chest.</p><p>"What is he  doing?" Nabiki whispered to Kasumi behind her hand.  Both of the two Tendo girls had been staring at the older man for  the last twenty minutes as he gestured and mumbled to himself.</p><p>"One never  can tell," Kasumi replied tartly, annoyed at this man's presence in her  home.</p><p>Looking at  the two of them, it was hard to see neither had had this much fun in quite  awhile.</p><p>"Hi,  oneechan," Akane announced, making the two girls jump.  "Need any help with dinner?"</p><p>Kasumi  shook her head quickly, moving to the stove.</p><p>"Guess I'll  start in on getting Ranma settled, then.   Where's the extra futon?"</p><p>Nabiki  blinked.  "You mean she isn't staying in  your room?"</p><p>Akane shook  her head.  "She said she wanted to be in  the same room as her father—"</p><p>"Nonsense!"  Kasumi exclaimed primly.  "A grown girl  like that, sleeping in the same room as her father does?  It's improper!"[10]</p><p>Akane  chewed her lower lip nervously.  "It's  what she's always been doing, oneechan—I don't think she'll be so comfortable  with me—"</p><p>"All the  more reason to get her started," Kasumi replied in a voice that brooked no  argument.  "Did you see what Ranma-chan  was wearing?  It's time she started  acting more like a proper girl, Akane, and the three of us can help her."  Light illuminated her silhouette for a  moment, perhaps a trick she'd picked up from Kuno-san.</p><p>"Oh dear,"  Akane breathed quietly.</p><p>"Not our  business, Kasumi-oneechan," Nabiki replied dryly.  Enthusiasm of any kind made her itch.</p><p>"But surely  the two of you must see that—" Kasumi began.</p><p>Ranma's  arrival down the stairs abruptly halted that conversation.  The redhead was wearing a pair of boxer  shorts and a sleeveless top, looking incredibly sexy in an utterly unconscious  way.  "Hi," she announced cheerfully,  grinning charmingly.</p><p>"Hi!" Akane  returned in kind.  "Why don't we go  upstairs while Kasumi finishes dinner—I'll show you where you're going to  sleep."  Her tone was a bit defeated;  she snuck Kasumi one last pleading glance before slinking upstairs, the redhead  trailing behind her.</p><p>Akane  slipped into her bedroom and Ranma took a good look around.  In many ways, it was a typical girl's room:  the wallpaper was yellow with a pretty, feminine pattern, and the bedspread  matched.  A small, stuffed piggy sat on  her bed.</p><p>There were  many ways, however, in which the room was somewhat schizophrenic as far as  gender was concerned.  Barbells (20  pounds each) sat untidily in the corner of the room, crossed slightly over one  another.  A couple of manga—Fushigi Yugi  and DBZ—littered the desk, along with some half-finished homework.</p><p>Ranma, who  had noticed the 'Akane' duck nameplate on the door, was beginning to wonder if  she was supposed to be sleeping with Akane.   Fiancées was one thing, but honestly!   Perhaps the girl was thinking of getting a little <i>too</i>  friendly.  She was about to speak, but  Akane beat her to the punch.</p><p>"My sister  insists you stay here with me," she said.   "Sorry, but I couldn't explain without giving you away.  So…"</p><p>"I'll sleep  on the floor," Ranma offered.</p><p>"Don't be  ridiculous," she snapped.  "You're my  guest—<i>I'll </i>sleep on the floor."</p><p>Ranma  paused.  "But you're the girl—you should  sleep in the bed."</p><p>Akane's arm  muscles tensed the way they had when Genma had exploded at Ranma's being  'beaten by a girl'.  "In case you  haven't noticed," she said, her voice still even and reasonable, "you happen to  be in the same condition yourself."</p><p>"But I'm a  boy!" Ranma countered.</p><p>"Riiight."  Akane sniffed.  "You have a girl <i>body</i> right now—which, by your reasoning,  should not sleep on floors.  Unless  you're implying that girls are somehow <i>mentally</i> unequipped to sleep on  hard surfaces?"</p><p>For a  moment, Ranma blinked at her; a drop of water from Ranma's wet hair dripped  down past her eyes and onto the floor.   Then, she began to giggle.</p><p>Akane's  serious expression only lasted for a heartbeat longer; her lips twitched and  she began to smile.  "Well," she  declared defensively, a bit of humor in her tone, "it's <i>true</i>…"</p><p>"The  travails of sleeping on the floor are utterly incomprehensible to the female  mind," Ranma intoned pompously, hands on hips.   "I claim the floor in the name of all manhood."</p><p>Akane began  to giggle helplessly.  "Riiight.  You look so manly now, too.  Your breasts especially."</p><p>"So what  are we going to do?"</p><p>Two pairs  of eyes, one blue, one brown, regarded the bed warily.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>[1] Joi is  pronounced in the Japanese way, and is not the American "Joy" variant.
