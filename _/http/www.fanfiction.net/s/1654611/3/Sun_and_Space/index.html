</div>Disclaimer: I don't own either Ranma ½ or Sailormoon…I wish I did so I can skip this part ^_^<p>Sun and Space:<p>Lord Strife (bishop_)<p>'xxx' – Thoughts<p>{xxx} – Panda Signs<p>Version 1.0<p>Chapter 2<p>~ Haruka and Michiru's Apartment, Juuban Ward ~<p>Even though Ranma and Akane said that they won't be back at the shrine until dinner time, the senshi decided to host their meeting at Haruka and Michiru's apartment to ensure privacy. Save for Mamoru, all the senshi were present, including Setsuna.<p>Usagi was seated on the floor, near the couch reading a manga she liberated from Rei awhile ago. Rei was sitting beside Usagi, looking for an opening to retake her manga. Ami was seated on the couch, reading a book (Advance Physics and its Practical Application in Daily Living. O_o). Minako and Makoto were also seated on the couch talking about Rei's cousin and that mysterious male senshi. Hotaru is seated on one of the pair of sofas and behind her stood her _parents_, Haruka and Michiru.<p>Setsuna came down from upstairs; gaining the attention of everyone in the room (even Usagi…after Rei regained her manga that is). Setsuna was just getting seated at one of the sofas when she was bombarded by questions.<p>"Who was that creep we fought?"<p>"Is Metallia really alive?"<p>"I thought Galaxia was our last opponent?"<p>"How was that black knight connected to Metallia?"<p>"Who were those two new senshi?"<p>"How did Ranma beat the youma?"<p>"Is the male senshi available?"<p>Everyone turned their heads towards Minako.<p>"What? It's a valid question ain't it?"<p>Setsuna raised her right hand to silence the senshi from further questions (and probable silly ones at that) so she could start answering the previous ones first.<p>"First…" Setsuna began, "That black armored knight we fought is named Aquilae. He is one of the Seven Obsidian Knights of Metallia, much like Beryl was."<p>"You mean they were the same league as Beryl?" asked Ami.<p>"Actually, Beryl was weakest of the knights." replied Setsuna earning a shocked look from the inners.<p>"W-what? She was the weakest? And we all died trying to fight her!" asked a perplexed Rei.<p>Ami regained a bit of her composure and asked a question that she knew was hanging (at least in theory) with the other inners' mind, "If they were Metallia's followers…how come we never fought any of them before?"<p>Setsuna looked at the gather senshi, for the briefest moment they saw her eyes start to tear, but was soon gone as she returned to that emotionless and cold eyes of hers. "That is were those two other senshi comes in."<p>Everyone leaned in as it was rare for Setsuna to divulge information so freely. "It was a month before the fall of the Silver Millennium…" Setsuna paused; making sure everyone was listening to her. "Sailor Sun and Sailor Vesta was dispatched to Space Colony TG-001A, in orbit between the planets Vesta and Mars."<p>"Wait a minute! There is no planet Vesta!" Haruka suddenly blurted out.<p>Setsuna gave Haruka the _look_ that made her shut her mouth quickly. "Vesta is now what we know as the asteroid field. Before we go into details on that…as I said Sailors Sun and Vesta were dispatched to that colony because of an SOS we received. To be able to respond on time, Sun and Vesta proceeded ahead of the Moon Guards…little did we know they were too late…and fell into an enemy trap.<p>"I'm not sure exactly how it happened…even that event was blocked-off from me…but from what I can tell, the most powerful six of Metallia's Obsidian Knights were on board the colony. When I got to the station with the Moon Guards, they were already dead. Apparently, Sailor Vesta used his Space Continuum Chrysalis to seal away the Obsidian Knights and it seems that both of them fueled that attack with their life force. A few days after that, an angry Metallia took out her frustration on the planet Vesta and completely destroyed the planet, leaving it as it is today, nothing more than chunks of rocks."<p>The senshi (especially Hotaru) shrugged at the concept of a planet being obliterated.<p>Usagi raised her hand to ask her question and Setsuna signaled for her to do so, "I thought we killed Metallia back then when we fought Beryl?"<p>Setsuna nodded, "I though so too. I had thought that Galaxia was the last hurdle to the realization of Crystal Tokyo…but apparently Metallia managed to survive that battle. As to how? I do not know. But it seems she managed to hide her presence from the time stream that not even I could have known of her survival."<p>Hotaru decided to ask her own question, "Um…Setsuna-mama?"<p>"Yes, Hotaru-chan?"<p>"Who exactly are Sailor Sun and Sailor Vesta?"<p>Setsuna had that thoughtful look before she answered, "They were…are (she corrected herself, knowing that they were now alive again) my best friends."<p>"BEST FRIENDS?" All present were shocked upon hearing Setsuna having any REAL friends. They often though the Senshi of Time was eternally: a lone-wolf.<p>"What? Can't a person make any friends?"<p>"No that's not we meant…it's…err…"<p>"Not like me?" Supplied Setsuna to the struggling Usagi, who nodded in reply.<p>"Even I had to make close friends sometime don't I?" The others merely nodded before Setsuna continued, "Vesta had that arrogant demeanor on him, that most people hate…and Sun had that violent temper that makes Mars look calm…"<p>Everyone, except Rei, began to imagine a person who could be more violent than Mars.<p>"HEY! I DON'T HAVE A VIOLENT TEMPER!" Rei shouted defiantly, only adding more to the evidence at hand.<p>Setsuna decided to ignore Rei's outburst and continued, "But needless to say, they were good friends…I mean really good friends. Vesta's promises were good as gold and never backs down on helping anyone who needs help. Sun has that kindness about her that easily out-balances her temper…"<p>Setsuna now has that longing look at her face. "Sailor Sun was the daughter of the royalty of the Sun Collective, a series of 16 orbital colonies around the sun far nearer than Mercury's orbit. The Sun Royal Family was a close relation to the Mercury Royal Family Line and it was said that the two royal families' ancestry could be traced back to a single person.<p>"Sailor Vesta was the son of the royalty of the Vesta Kingdom, which was originally a principality of Mars Kingdom. Apparently as you can see, Sailor Vesta is a male senshi. In the Vesta Kingdom, the first born child of the royal family is the one usually ascending to the rank of senshi, regardless if the child is male or female. And much like me, the Senshi of Vesta also gains a guardianship title: the Guardian of Space."<p>"Guardian of Space?" asked a very interested Ami.<p>"Guardians of Time and Space maintain the delicate balance of reality. Both share an equal amount of secrets and knowledge. I was already Time Guardian for 10 years before Prince Arthel assumed title of Sailor Vesta and became Space Guardian."<p>"So he too can know what the future would bring?" asked further by Haruka, thinking that if this new senshi would be more willing to share information than the Senshi of Time.<p>"No, that is the privilege of the Time Guardian…but he can create warps or portals directly to the places he needs or wants to go to."<p>"Why didn't he use that back then to bring in the Moon Guards or the other senshi with him?" asked Michiru.<p>"I needed to organize the Moon Guards that were to accompany us. Vesta and Sun decided to proceed ahead of us because every single second would be invaluable if there was indeed trouble at the colony. And I would assume that the knights employed some sort of magical nullifier as to prevent Vesta from using those powers to create an escape portal."<p>"So is Vesta available?" asked a boy-hungry Minako.<p>Makoto also had that look in her eyes, hoping that the said senshi was indeed available.<p>Setsuna did something the others thought they never see: laugh. "Sorry to disappoint you Mina-chan and you too Mako-chan…"<p>Everyone had in their thoughts: Mina-chan? Mako-chan? From Setsuna?<p>While giggling slightly, Setsuna continued. "Vesta is already taken and you need to get pass Sailor Sun to do so. And Sun is NOT keen on sharing him with anyone. Sun is probably the next most powerful senshi after Saturn if you don't count the powers of Time and Space."<p>"How powerful is she?" asked Rei.<p>"She couldn't shatter a planet if that's what you're asking…" the others visibly relaxed at that, but Setsuna dropped the other shoe, "But she can incinerate any and all living things on a planet and leave it as desolate as the moon is now." With that everyone paled at the extent of Sun's powers, shattered planet or not.<p>"Err…so I guess he's hands-off then…hahaha…" replied a nervous Minako, having second thoughts in attempting to steal the heart of Vesta.<p>"Going to other things…" Ami began, "How did Ranma defeat those youmas so easily?"<p>"Lot's of practice." answered Haruka and Makoto in unison.<p>"Huh?"<p>Haruka decided to fill in the others, "In the monthly Martial Artist of Japan, there is column there regarding Ranma and a certain Ryoga Hibiki being able to pull-off Ki-attacks. And it is said those two are quite strong, and there was a saying that if any of those two were hit by a speeding truck, you'll feel sorry for the truck."<p>There was a collective 'ohhhs' and 'ahhhs' from the senshi except for Setsuna, Makoto and Haruka.<p>"Ah! I remember now, Ranma provided a little demo of his Ki back at the station!" Ami finally remembering the little ball of Ki Ranma demonstrated for them. "From what I could tell, that Ki is the same energy that Beryl was siphoning from people!"<p>Rei also finally remembers the said demo as well. "Ki is the life-force of all living things. I also use a little Ki in my fire-reading and I was planning of asking him about that later." Shaking her head she continued, "But still the amount of ki he used, the way he moved, his speed…all seems quite impossible."<p>Ami was typing something on her computer, "I think he called one of his attacks a _chestnut fist_. Apparently, he was throwing several hundred punches per minute at the speed of 75 m/s." (A/N: I'm not sure to exactly how fast Chestnut Fist really is…especially involving Ranma)<p>Everyone's jaw dropped at that little fact. They were now thinking if Ranma was even human.<p>"Not to mention being struck by a heavily armored knight and crashing into a wall and still be able to get out of it alive." added by Michiru.<p>"Is he even human?" asked Usagi.<p>"HEY! Are you saying my cousin's a youma or something?" Rei asked as she glared at Usagi.<p>"He's very much human, based on my scans." Ami replied.<p>"In any case, I have nothing more to say. Crystal Tokyo's existence is in jeopardy and that's the main reason I'm here. It is just an added bonus, a very big one at that, that Vesta and Sun were awakened. And we may need their help on this one." With that Setsuna stood from where she was sitting down, and proceeded to head upstairs.<p>"Where are you going Setsuna?" asked Haruka.<p>"To sleep, it's been a long day." Setsuna replied casually.<p>Ami turned her attention to Rei, "Rei, can I come over to the shrine? I would like to talk a little more with Akane."<p>"Sure! You don't need my permission to go see your cousin. Hopefully those two have returned by now."<p>"I guess that settles this little meeting." With that Makoto stood and headed for the door. "I'll be going on ahead. I still need to cook dinner."<p>"Guess, better go home too. *Sigh* Why are all the good ones taken?" Minako also stood and followed Makoto towards the door a little disappointed in her prospects.<p>Ami and Rei followed suit. Usagi decided to head home too and fill in Luna of their impromptu meeting. 'Boy, will Luna get upset for not being part of the meeting!'<p>As the scouts were going about their way, two people stood on top of Haruka and Michiru's apartment, apparently eavesdropping on the said conversation.<p>"You were right Arthel. They are the other senshi!" Sailor Sun said to her companion as the scrying spell Sailor Vesta cast was fading.<p>"I never thought Metallia would find a way to free those Obsidian Knights from that Chrysalis we sealed them into." Sailor Vesta said as he replayed in his mind the battle he and Sun did all those millennia ago.<p>Sailor Sun and Sailor Vesta stood silently on the roof and were startled when a voice spoke from behind them.<p>"I knew it was you when I felt that scrying spell watching over us!"<p>Sun and Vesta turned to see Setsuna, now transformed as Sailor Pluto, on the roof with them holding her Time Staff in her right hand.<p>"Hey Setsuna! Long time no see!" Vesta said with a smirk.<p>Sun bopped Vesta in the head to rid his face that annoying smirk.<p>Pluto smiled; it felt good to see her best friends alive once more. "So, why didn't you two join the meeting below? It would have been far easier if you two were the ones who did the explanation down there."<p>"Nah, it seems you handled that quite well. There was no need for us to get involved…yet" answered Vesta.<p>"Why?" Setsuna asked inquisitively.<p>"We still want a few moments to ourselves. We still haven't recovered much of our memories…much less our powers. And we wanted time for ourselves…because of our current lives have been…err, rather chaotic." supplied Sailor Sun.<p>"So, who are your identities in this time and age?" Setsuna inquired.<p>This time, both Vesta and Sun smirked. "Now that is for us to know, and for you to find out!" they said in unison.<p>Sailor Pluto sighed. 'I forgotten how they loved to tease me about things I didn't know…'<p>Sun smiled more brightly, she had forgotten how fun it was to tease the ever-knowing Pluto, "But you need not worry Setsuna. If you or the other senshi, especially the princess, would need help we'll be there."<p>Pluto smiled again.<p>"We better go now Sun." Vesta turned to look at Pluto again. "It has been great getting re-acquainted with you Setsuna. Tell the princess we're always ready to help her."<p>"I will." Setsuna replied.<p>With that Vesta, raised his right hand and the Space Staff appeared and with it, he opened a warp that he and Sun stepped into leaving Pluto alone on the roof.<p>'Same old Arthel and Lithea.' Pluto thought to herself with a smile. 'I better go back too, unless Haruka suspects anything more.'<p>~ Somewhere ~<p>Aquilae was bowing low before a furious Metallia.<p>"SO, VESTA AND SUN ARE REBORN AS WELL!" Metallia's voice boomed and echoed in the large chamber. Metallia no longer appeared as a black mist, but in her true form: A twenty foot black dragon. Black energy seemed to slip out of her flaming mouth.<p>"I STILL HAVEN'T FULLY REOVERED FROM MY INJURIES AND I STILL REQUIRE A LOT OF ENERGY FROM THOSE PATHETIC HUMANS." She turned her head towards her other knights, also bowing low to her. "AURIGAE! I AM ASSIGNING YOU IN THE TASK OF COLLECTING THE ENERGY FOR ME."<p>The said knight straightened to acknowledge his orders, "I understand my queen, and what of the senshi?"<p>"AQUILAE!"<p>Aquilae straightened himself to hear out his orders as well.<p>"My queen?"<p>"YOU WILL PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED DIVERSION FOR AURIGAE TO COLLECT THE ENERGY I NEED IF YOU CAN KILL THE SENSHI, SO MUCH THE BETTER. CEPHEI!"<p>This time a female knight straightened to acknowledge Metallia, "The youma production is in schedule, if that is what you would inquire my queen. They would be ready soon."<p>"GOOD. SOON THIS WORLD AND THIS SOLAR SYSTEM WOULD ONCE AGAIN BOW DOWN BEFORE ITS' TRUE QUEEN!"<p>And Metallia's mad laughter filled the chamber as the knights went about to do their orders.<p>~ Hikawa Shrine, Juuban Ward ~<p>Rei and Ami arrived at the shrine to find Ranma and Akane has not yet returned. Grandfather Hino and Nodoka were sitting at the tea room, having a little hearty discussion when the two girls arrived.<p>"Tadaima!" Rei called out.<p>"Okaerinasai, Rei-chan. Good afternoon, Ami-chan." replied Nodoka as she greeted the two as they enter.<p>"Good afternoon, Mrs. Saotome." Ami bowed as she returned the greeting.<p>Nodoka waved her hand at Ami, "Call me auntie, Ami-chan. After all we may soon all be family."<p>It did not even register to the Rei and Ami the likely outcome when Ranma and Akane did get married, that they will be distant relatives…somewhat. And that brought smiles to the two friends.<p>"If you say so, Auntie Nodoka." Ami said with a bright smile that also gave a smile on Nodoka's face.<p>"Father will be at the sacred fire, he said he will do a little meditating." Nodoka said, as if answering an unvoiced question of Rei. "So would you two like to help me set-up the table for dinner? And Ami-chan, I do suggest you stay for dinner! I'm sure your mother won't mind and it would Akane-chan happy to be able to talk to you more."<p>"Yes, I'd love that auntie. I think I'll give her a call now." Ami replied, heading towards the phone.<p>"So auntie, Ranma and Akane hasn't come back yet?" Rei asked her aunt from the kitchen.<p>"No, they haven't. But don't worry, they'll be home soon. Knowing Ranma, he's not the type to miss dinner." Both women laugh a little at that joke.<p>Ami then entered the kitchen, all smiles. "Mom said I can even stay here for the night. Apparently she was going to stay at the hospital tonight; due to a large number of people in the emergency room…I hope I won't be trouble."<p>"Not all Ami. You can bunk in with me."<p>The front door slid open and a chorus of "Tadaima!" was heard.<p>Nodoka stepped out of the kitchen and greeted her son and future daughter-in-law. "Okaerinasai! You two seemed to have enjoyed your little walk judging from your happy faces."<p>The two young teens blushed at Nodoka's comment. "Hey is dinner ready?" Ranma asked while his stomach growled in synch, earning a bop on the head from Akane and giggle from the other three women.<p>'My! We've been here for only a day and those two are staring to get along pretty well!' Nodoka smiled more brightly at the young couple and said, "Dinner is ready you two, all we need is to set the table. Rei-chan? Ami-chan? Could you two do it? I'll be introducing Ranma and Akane to father."<p>"No problem auntie." Rei answered.<p>"We'll take care of it." Ami supplied.<p>"Great, now come along you two. Father is meditating before the sacred fire." With that, Nodoka led Ranma and Akane towards the sacred fire temple.<p>"Talk to you later Ami!" Akane called out before she disappeared around the corner.<p>Grandfather Hino was just finishing his meditations when Nodoka slipped open the doors to the sacred fire shrine. The small old man turned to see his eldest daughter and smiled when he saw his grandson.<p>"RANMA!" The old man cried happily as he stood and ran towards the young teen. Ranma squatted so that he could hug his grandfather.<p>"Hi, gramps! Sorry if I haven't been visiting…" Ranma said a little guiltily, after all he hardly remembers having any other family member beyond his baka oyaji.<p>"No need to be sorry my grandson. Your mother told me everything about you, and how you turned out to be a fine young man…" the old man's features briefly darken, "…despite the upbringing of that idiotic Genma!" His smile returns when he regards Ranma again. "Yes, you're quite a fine young man, and I'm proud to be your grandfather!"<p>Ranma turned his head to regard Akane, and she entered the room. "Umm, gramps...I would like you to meet my fiancée, Tendo Akane." Ranma gestures to the girl standing behind him.<p>"Please to meet you, Grandfather Hino." Akane bowed as she made her greeting.<p>The old man was smiling even more and he pats Ranma on the shoulder, "Quite a fiancée you have Ranma! I'm not at all surprised to see that you picked out quite a lovely young lady." He turns to face Akane bows, "Welcome to the family Akane-chan." 'I know you would fit nicely as a shrine maiden but I'm sure Rei would not like the idea of me try to do that a family member…'<p>"Come along now everyone, I think by now the tables ready." Nodoka then walked out of the room and headed towards the dinning room.<p>Dinner went normally, with a little talk between cousins. Ami and Akane were talking about things like school and about Akane's sisters. Rei and Ranma were talking about ki techniques and even managed to get Ranma to agree to teach her to control more of her ki.<p>Grandfather Hino was about to stand up when he accidentally bumps into Rei causing her to dump the contents of her glass of water on Ranma.<p>"Oh! I'm so sorry! Ran…ma?" Rei asked bewildered as the handsome and tall young man turned into a lovely and petite young woman.<p>Ami decided to look at the commotion and was shocked to see a girl wearing exactly the same clothes as Ranma was earlier…even her hair was done in a similar pig-tail.<p>Grandfather Hino was already bringing out wards to place onto the girl, fearing an evil spirit possessed his grandson.<p>"Umm, hehe sorry about this…yes I'm Ranma. Gramps could you lower those wards please…I think I can explain…"<p>Three confused looking people were shocked. How could a man turn into a woman? And how come Akane and Nodoka were not freaking out?<p>Ranma sighed, "Hey Akane could you bring me some hot water?"<p>"Sure Ranma."<p>Ranma then returned his attention to three people with their jaws hanging, "Let's see where to begin? Ah! It was about one and half years ago…"<p>(A/N: I ain't writing that stuff anymore…it has been told over and over countless times and I think I don't need to elaborate on it…if you don't know the story of Ranma getting cursed…then you should watch first the series!)<p>Ranma, now back in male-form, told his life story. This time however, probably due to the old personality of 'Arthel/Sailor Vesta' he was divulging information he normally kept as secrets.<p>He told of the training at Jusenkyou, the amazons and their stupid laws, the cat-fist (that made his mom, grandfather, cousin, and Ami so mad he could swear that the floor was on fire!), Ukyou and the multitude of fiancées his father arranged for him (needless to say the fire he saw earlier was fast becoming a firestorm), the Kunos, Happosai…and finally Ryouga and his little secret.<p>"HE'S WHAT!" Akane suddenly yelled.<p>Ranma cringed from his spot. The firestorm has now become a supernova.<p>'That little pervert! No wonder Ranma was so jealous whenever P-chan was around. He would taunt the other the same way…and I would beat him up for it! Oh gods! And he was only protecting me! That little creep abused my trust! And he abuses the promise Ranma made him! He watched me changed…heard my secrets…' Akane was now in full-battle mode, "I'M GONNA KILL THAT PERVERTED LITTLE PIG!"<p>Nodoka was seething in anger as well, she knew Ranma was a man of his word and would not break his word but sometimes…promises needs to be broken if it causes more harm than good. She smiles a little, knowing that a certain pig will get it's just desserts.<p>Rei and Ami were also very angry, how could a person like that take advantage of someone's innocence and trust like that?<p>Ranma bowed to the people in front of him, "I know I'm very much to blame for it. I should have told you a long time ago…but my damn sense of honor clouded me." He looks up at Akane, "I promise this you Akane, I will no longer put my honor before yours."<p>Akane knew she too was to blame; she had been too stupid…or blind…not to see the connection. All the jokes and clues Ranma dropped…how could she be so naive?<p>Akane moved towards Ranma and cried as she hugged him, "Promise me that Ranma…and…and…I'm so sorry for all the nasty things I did to you when…when…you were only protecting me…" her sobs increase as she remembers ever single beating she gave him.<p>Ranma caressed her head and made soothing sounds, and soon Akane was able to regain her composure.<p>"I'll have that pig castrated the moment I catch him." Akane said with a voice promising pain.<p>"I'll help!" Rei volunteered.<p>'I'm in too! No one does that to my cousin!" Ami who is normally kind and mellow was radiating the same amount of battle aura as Akane was awhile ago.<p>Nodoka was thinking something of making bacon for breakfast.<p>And somewhere in South America, a certain lost boy felt a shiver run down his spine. "What the hell was that? I don't know why, but RANMA THIS IS ALL FAULT! Now how to get back to Mt. Fuji?" he started to walk eastward and after a few minutes was in the streets of India (O_o).<p>The older Hino was nodding; at least some good came out of it. "I'll go take a look at the scrolls that I have regarding curses. There maybe something in there to help you my boy."<p>Ranma nodded his thanks. He then felt Rei place a hand on his shoulder.<p>"But you're not out of the woods yet Ranma. You need to be punished for letting such an act go for so long!" Rei said with a little smirk on her face.<p>'Now I know why people hate it when I give that kind of smirk.' Ranma thought to himself.<p>Rei said something that made Ranma looked very pale. Nodoka, Ami, the elder Hino, and even Akane were laughing at the propose punishment.<p>"NOOOO! Anything but that!" Ranma pleaded but much to his dismay, no one listened.<p>~ Next day Sunday, Juuban Park ~<p>"Come on Ranma. It ain't so bad." Rei teased behind her cousin.<p>Akane and Ami are giggling much to Ranma's dismay. Ranma's apparent punishment was…to walk in public for a day, wearing a girl's dress…complete with girl underwear and a bra. And to walk with them in a lingerie shop and help the girls buy some stuff. And as part of his punishment, he should pick at least one lingerie from the store and put it on until they get home.<p>'Man…I hate this…I hate this…I hate this…' Ranma repeated to himself.<p>"HEY AMI! REI!" a girl shouted from the back and everyone turned to see a cheerful Usagi running towards them, Makoto and Minako in tow.<p>"Hi Usagi! What are three doing here?" asked Ami.<p>"We were planning on going to the mall and do some window shopping!" Usagi then noticed Akane and waved at her. Then she noticed a girl she hasn't met before. She ran up next to her and cheerfully grabbed her hands and introduced herself, "Hi! My name's Usagi. Are you a friend of Ami and Rei's too?"<p>Ranma was in a stupor so Rei decided to answer for him, "She…he's Ranma you dolt!"<p>The other three girls' jaws dropped. No way is this girl Ranma! Ranma was taller and was definitely a man! This girl was shorter than Akane was, and very female! Although there was an uncanny resemblance…maybe she was his twin sister and was playing a prank on them.<p>"I maybe a ditz Rei…but I know when you're pulling my leg!" Usagi pouted as she glared at Rei.<p>"I am Ranma." Said the red-head girl with a sigh. "It's a long story…care to hear it?"<p>About half an hour later the young teens were sitting under a tree in the park when Ranma told them about his curse…and apparent punishment. The other three girls: Usagi, Makoto and Minako reacted the same way as Rei and Ami did. And they were planning on doing something of their own to the little perverted pig, and decided to join in giving out Ranma's punishment…much to his dismay.<p>It was nearing lunch when the seven of them left that lingerie store. Ranma was blushing REAL bad. Minako had apparently picked out lingerie for him to wear that cause the other girls to fits of laughter. In was lacy, blue-color lingerie that left little to the imagination.<p>"Come on Ranma, it's only for one day." Akane said but soon started laughing again.<p>Ranma was about to respond with a retort when a scream caught their ears.<p>Several youma, similar to what they fought yesterday appeared on the streets tearing the sidewalks apart. And a few feet away from those youma stood the black armored knight, Aquilae.<p>"Come out come out wherever you are senshi! Unless you do…downtown Juuban will be nothing more than rubble!" Aquilae taunted to the dispersing crowd. He was certain the senshi will come and fight, and when they do…he'll get his revenge.<p>"Not that weirdo again!" Ranma muttered under her breath. Before he could call out to the other girls, a car was sent flying towards their direction. Usagi and her friends jumped towards the left and shouted something before running away from the scene.<p>Ranma and Akane jumped towards the right and heard Usagi yell something like and get away and take cover. They knew that they were going to find a place to transform. They still didn't know that Akane and Ranma were the other two senshi.<p>In a soft whisper, "Akane we also need to transform but I need hot water first to change back to a guy otherwise I doubt my armor will fit my girl form."<p>Akane nodded and she and Ranma ran opposite direction as the others did.<p>Aquilae looked on as the youma devastated anything that came across their path. Soon, he knew, the senshi will come. And as predicted they did appear…at least five of them did.<p>"Halt!" Sailor Moon stood to take her pose, "Streets are for people to use in going about their lives! You have no right to destroy such! We the pretty !"<p>Before she could finish her speech a youma blasted the place where they were standing.<p>"So much for entrances…SPARKLING WAVE PRESSURE!" Jupiter yelled out as she hit the youma that just attacked them.<p>The youma just covered its' head with it's' arms as it took head on Jupiter's attack.<p>"BURNING MANDALA!"<p>The same youma that blocked Jupiter's assault was again hit by Mar's fire attack and melted its' armor, and the follow up attack of Jupiter on the now weakened youma caused it to disintegrate.<p>"RROOOAAAARRR!" The remaining youmas charged all together against the senshi.<p>"Crap! They're coming in too fast everyone spread out!" Mercury called out as she and the others stepped away from the rampaging youma.<p>"SOLAR FLARE!"<p>"NULL VORTEX!"<p>Before the youma could even stop from their charge, they were all hit simultaneously by the magical attack of the newly arrived senshi and dissolved into ash.<p>"Ah! Vesta and Sun! How good of you two to join the party!"<p>Sailor Vesta and Sailor Sun faced the source of the voice. Aquilae was standing a few feet away from them, his hands gathering a sizable magical ball.<p>"DEATH BALL SEIZURE!"<p>The black energy shoots out of his hands and headed for Vesta and Sun's location. Vesta pulled out his Space Staff and conjured up a magical barrier to protect him and Sun.<p>"REALITY SHIELD!"<p>The black energy exploded upon impact and buckled Vesta's shield a little. Sailor Sun then took the opportunity to attack. She jumped out from behind Vesta called out her attack, "SOLAR FLARE!"<p>Aquilae jumped back to avoid the blast but before he could counter he jumped back again to avoid a lightning attack.<p>"VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN!"<p>"SHABON SPRAY FREEZING!"<p>Aquilae raised his own shield to protect against the incoming magical barrage.<p>"Ha! Your powers will not penetrate my shield!" Aquilae taunted.<p>"Then try this…" Sailor Sun said as she launches another attack, "SOLAR WIND CUTTER!"<p>The magical attack Sun launch acted like a razor as it flew towards Aquilae. Aquilae reacted a little slower and when the Solar Wind Cutter sliced through his shield he barely managed to dodge.<p>"DAMN YOU SENSHI!" But then Aquilae's frown turned into a sinister smile, and he laughed as he teleported away.<p>"What was that about?" asked a confused Sailor Moon.<p>Just then Mercury's communicator beeped and Sailor Uranus face appeared on the monitor.<p>"We got problem girls!" Uranus started. "People from the mall were attacked by several youmas and were drained of their energy!"<p>To be continued…
