</div>Disclaimer: I don't own either Ranma ½ or Sailormoon…I wish I did so I can skip this part ^_^<p>Sun and Space:<p>Lord Strife (bishop_)<p>'xxx' – Thoughts<p>{xxx} – Panda Signs<p>Version 1.0<p>Chapter 3<p>~ Past…Silver Millennium, Moon Palace ~<p>'Who does that noble think she is!' Lithea thought angrily to herself as she stormed-off into the garden, with the guards and maids scampering away from her path. 'Just because the Sun Collective is small nation she thinks she can look down on me and my people! Humph, the nerve of that old woman…I think I'll toast her next time I see her!'<p>She walked into garden trying to calm her nerves. Being with nature has always had a soothing effect on her. Her scowl was slowly disappearing and soon she was smiling her beautiful smile again. She was watching the birds fly when she heard singing.<p>'That's a beautiful voice! I wonder who it is…' she began to follow the source of the singing, and found a man sitting under a tree who is roughly around her age. She noticed his garments and easily deduced he was royalty. It took her sometime to determine which planet it was…Vesta. 'That man must be Prince Arthel.'<p>~~~<p>Prince Arthel never did liked politics and court intrigues, so when the moon council started convening he asked the Vesta ambassador to be his proxy and left shortly for the garden. He looked for a quiet spot, sat down and began singing a song his mother taught him when he was still young. It always had that calming effect on him. When he finished singing and opened his eyes, he saw her watching him. 'Princess Lithea?' Arthel cleared his throat, "Umm…would you like to join me, Princess Lithea?"<p>Lithea blushed as she realized that Arthel was finally aware of her presence. She complied with Arthel's invitation and gently sat close to him. "That was a beautiful song."<p>"Thanks. My mom taught it to me. She said that whenever I feel lonely, scared or just plain bored…just sing that song and it would raise your spirits, guaranteed!" He said with a smile that made Lithea blush more. "So…what are you doing here princess?"<p>Lithea sighed, "Some arrogant noble from Earth, I think her name was Beryl…thinks she is so high and mighty just because my nation is small that my opinions on alliance matters didn't even matter!"<p>Arthel shook his head, "Don't worry about it to much. The old ghoul does that to everyone…regardless of their planet's origin." Arthel smiled a bit at a memory, "You should have seen her when she taunted the Princess of Mars, who afterwards literally set her hair on fire!"<p>Lithea laughed at the image that formed on her mind.<p>Arthel stood-up and offered his hand to Lithea to help her up. "Would you like to have dinner with me?"<p>~ Present…Hikawa Shrine, Juuban Ward ~<p>Akane woke to the bright sun that was filtering in her window sill. She rubbed her eyes a little. 'I think…I just remembered how I first met Arthel…err…Ranma…' She smiled at the memory. Despite her temper he never did once shone her away…interestingly she never shone him away either for his arrogant behavior. She stretched a little and got out of bed. 'Well…today's the first day of school for Juuban High.'<p>With that Akane got dressed in a uniform similar to that of Usagi's and headed towards the dining room. She was still at the hallway when she saw Rei and Ami stepping out of Rei's room. Ami had bunked in with Rei since Nodoka slept with Akane. "Ohayou, Rei-chan! Ami-chan!"<p>"Ohayou, Akane-chan!" Ami smiled as she returned her cousin's greeting.<p>"Ohayou!" Rei returned the greeting also, "So are you excited on your first day in Juuban High?"<p>"A little…hopefully nothing weird is happening there…" Akane hoped that this school will not end up like Furinkan did.<p>Rei giggled a little, "Not really, unless you count the youma making an appearance once in a while."<p>The smile on the girls' faces slowly died as they remembered the events on last night at Juuban Mall when all those unfortunate people got drained of their energy.<p>"Come on, I think breakfast is ready and we need to go to school soon." Ami pointed out.<p>Rei and Akane nodded.<p>The three arrived at the dinning room to see Ranma already sitting down beside grandfather Hino who was busy lecturing Ranma on proper _dinning etiquette_ as per suggestion of Nodoka. Grandfather Hino was more than willing to remove any stains of Genma's influence on his grandson.<p>"Ohayou Gozaimasu!" Nodoka greeted the Akane, Ami, and Rei, "Breakfast is ready. Why don't you girls take your sits so that I start serving it?"<p>The girls nodded. Akane sat down next to Ranma, Ami next to her while Rei sat next to her grandfather.<p>"So? Did Ranma's table manners improved?" Akane asked with an evil grin as she looked at him.<p>Ranma snorted, "Uncute tomboy!"<p>"WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?" Akane yelled as she brought out her mallet and swung it down on Ranma's head.<p>Grandfather Hino, Rei, and Ami were shocked, 'Where did that mallet came from?' they all thought. They were busy so pondering this that they did not catch the small wink Ranma and Akane gave each other.<p>"Now, you two…no fighting until breakfast is done." Nodoka chastised the two teens. 'Well at least they mellowed down somehow…usually those two would argue until they would leave for school.' Nodoka shook her head to clear it. "I placed your bentos on your bags. I made one for you too Ami-chan."<p>"You shouldn't have auntie!" Ami was slightly embarrassed. "I shouldn't impose on you like that…"<p>"Not really dear. Now go on eat your breakfast or all of you will be late for school."<p>Breakfast relatively went quietly…not counting the few insults Ranma and Akane exchanged. Though Nodoka could see that they mellowed down, she had hoped the two would eventually cease it. And Ami and Rei had both silently agreed to each other to ask Akane were she got that mallet.<p>Rei bid her farewell as she headed in the direction of her school, leaving Ami to walk Ranma and Akane to school.<p>~ Haruka and Michiru's Apartment ~<p>"I'll be going now!" Hotaru called out as she left for school.<p>A few minutes later Haruka and Michiru too left in Haruka's car, leaving Setsuna as the only resident of the housing complex.<p>'Arthel and Lithea…I know you two are nearby…if you think I would just sit around and wait for you two to reveal your identities then you're sorely mistaken!' Setsuna smirked to herself. 'I may not be able to use the Time Gates to look for you two…but I could always hire someone else to seek you two out...'<p>She picked-up her little phone book and skimmed through the numbers. She found the number she was looking for and dialed it. Soon she heard a response from the other side, "Hello Tendo Residence. This is Nabiki speaking."<p>"My name is Meiou Setsuna, and I have a job for you…"<p>~~~<p>Hotaru was basically skipping to school today. Last night she had a dream…or more correctly, a remembered memory of Silver Millennium.<p>~ Past…Silver Millennium, Moon Palace ~<p>Princess Alexia, the senshi of Saturn, sat alone in the corner of the ballroom. Although there was a festivity, no one has ever bothered talking to her. People all around her, feared her powers. They rather not get involved with the Senshi of Destruction.<p>She sighed, but soon felt someone standing in front of her. She thought it was another of those snobbish nobles came to insult her again. When she looked-up she saw the Senshi of the Sun, with a bright smile on her face looking at her.<p>"Mind if take a sit?" she asked.<p>"Sure go ahead, I don't mind at all." Alexia replied.<p>"You are the newly appointed senshi of Saturn are you not? Princess Alexia?"<p>Alexia nodded.<p>"My name's Lithea. I'm the senshi of the Sun. It's a pleasure to meet you."<p>Alexia looked at Lithea carefully, as if expecting an insult or something but it never came. So she asked, "You're…not afraid of me?"<p>Lithea turned to look at her with a smile, "Why should I? You're not a monster."<p>"People think I am. Since my powers can destroy a planet…"<p>"That's just stupid." Lithea replied, but sighed. "I guess I am no different from you…people too try and avoid me…"<p>This got Alexia's attention. "Huh? Why would they?"<p>"My power comes second to yours. Though I may not be able destroy an entire planet…I could however make it as lifeless as a desolate moon…and people fear me for that."<p>Alexia nodded in agreement. People tend to fear them for their powers, but ironic as it seems, people need their powers to protect them.<p>Lithea shook her head to clear it of sad thoughts. "But even so, there are still people who are of kind heart. And they do not judge you based on only what they see and hear but from what's within you." Lithea pointed out to someone and Alexia turned to look at where Lithea was pointing.<p>"Queen Serenity…" Alexia said in a whisper.<p>Lithea nodded, "There are others too, Princess Setsuna, Prince Arthel, the other senshi…we will not hesitate to be your friend."<p>Alexia felt…happy. A friend? She never really had one. Back in Saturn, the only people she could talk to was her elder brothers and her parents. She rarely goes out of the castle, the side-effect of over-protective parents.<p>"Will…you really be…my friend?" Alexia asked, fearfully. She felt she needed confirmation.<p>Lithea smiled, "Of course I will."<p>Arthel soon came up next to the two, "Seems like you had made friends already with Princess Alexia, didn't you Lithea?" He smiled to the two of them and looked at Alexia, "Hi! My name is Arthel, you want to be friends?" (A/N: I thought it was Akane who said that…oh well…).<p>~ Present… ~<p>Hotaru has that bright smile on her face. She recalled numerous times when Lithea and Arthel helped her deal with those obnoxious nobles. And from time to time, even Setsuna did.<p>Hotaru was such in high-spirits she did not noticed her usual bullies, three of them, waiting to ambush her. She never saw the leg that stuck out and she trip and fell face first.<p>"Hahahahaha…well look at the freak…she seemed to have a liking for sidewalk pavements if she likes kissing them so often…" one of the boys said as they all fell again in fits of laughter.<p>Hotaru, trying hard not to cry, bit her upper lip and pulled herself up to a sitting position. Before she could stand, one of the other boys grabbed her hair and pulled her up.<p>Hotaru could no longer hold her tears, just then she heard someone yell, "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PERVERTS DOING TO HER!"<p>~~~<p>The night before, Ranma and Akane decided to act a little more of their _old_ selves, just in case anyone from Nerima would catch wind of them, and more importantly to throw Setsuna off track.<p>"Say Akane…" Ami began.<p>"Hmm?"<p>"Where'd you get that mallet?"<p>"Oh, some kid, with weird looking tattoos on her face, gave it to me. She said it could help keep perverts at bay." Akane said this while grinning towards Ranma, who just mumbled something incoherent.<p>"Forgot her name though...seemed to be gaijin…"<p>(A/N: I wonder who could that be ^_^)<p>Ami just shrugged, since she became a senshi, she knew that the world was filled with weird things that no science would be able to explain. Better leave it at that or the foundations of physics would be unraveled.<p>At this moment, Ranma jumped up on the wall and began waling on top of it. Ami, who was not used seeing this, was stupefied (well…more like 'really, really impressed'…since the word 'stupid' doesn't really fit into Ami's dictionary).<p>"Wow! That's an amazing display of balance Ranma-kun!"<p>Ranma merely rubbed the back of his head, "Nah, it's nothing really…I usually walk on wire-fences so this one's a lot easier."<p>"Show off!" Akane huffed, and then stopped. Ahead of her she saw a small of group of boys picking on a helpless girl. Upon closer inspection she recognize her as Hotaru...as in Sailor Saturn…as in…Alexia!<p>Ranma stopped from his tracks as he noticed Akane's aura started to glow again. He initially thought it was something he did but upon closer look he noticed she was directing it at another. He turned to look where she was directing her glare and saw three bullies picking on a girl…a girl named Hotaru…Alexia!<p>Ami suddenly felt a sudden tension in the air. She then saw Hotaru being picked-on by the usual bullies. 'Damn! If only Makoto was here…wait a minute! Ranma and Akane are martial artists too…' Before she could react she heard Akane yell.<p>Ranma was about to show those bullies a thing or two when Akane yell a battle cry.<p>"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PERVERTS DOING TO HER!"<p>Hotaru turned to the sound of the voice, as well as her attackers. She saw Ami standing there with Ranma and Akane…apparently it was this girl Akane that yelled.<p>One of the bullies turned to look at them, "She's a freak of nature! She deserves this!"<p>Before the guy could blink, Akane pulled out her mallet and struck the guy down so hard his face was embedded into the pavement.<p>"SHE'S NOT A FREAK! YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN BULLIES PICKING ON HELPLESS PEOPLE!"<p>Akane was about to mallet the other two boys, who by now were cringing at where they were standing, hey who wouldn't after all it's not everyday you see a boy become part of the sidewalk (unless your in Nerima). When Ranma stopped her, "Calm down Akane…."<p>Ami knelt besides Hotaru and help her up to her feet while Akane took some deep breaths in order to calm herself.<p>Ranma faced the other two boys still standing, "Let's get this straight, if we ever…EVER…hear you and other bullies picking on her or anyone else for that matter…you're going to get a lot more pain than what this guy got! You understand?" The two boys gulped and then nodded. "Good. Now get your friend and leave…NOW!"<p>The two boys didn't waste time to help their friend up, but before they could leave, Akane decided to give them one last pummeling...A trip to LEO. (Low Earth Orbit)<p>Ami watched as the three disappeared into the sky, "Umm…they won't get killed or maimed? Won't they?"<p>"Nah…judging from the trajectory Akane launched them, they'll be landing in the park's fountain." Ranma just shrugged. "Akane just wanted to leave a sound impression…I don't think those bullies would ever bother Ale…err, Hotaru again."<p>Ami noticed the correction Ranma applied. But couldn't place what it was.<p>Hotaru also noticed it, 'He was about to call me Alexia...' She took a look at both Akane and Ranma. 'They…can't be them…could they?'<p>"Are you okay Hotaru-chan? They didn't hurt you bad did they?" Akane asked worriedly, simply oblivious to Ranma's near slipped of the tongue.<p>Hotaru shook her head slightly, "No, I'm alright…it's nothing really…it happens to me every time…" Hotaru smiled. 'It is them…I could…feel it…my best friends…Ranma and Akane are…' She looked at them with a smile much brighter than what she had, had earlier. "You two are Sailor Vesta and Sailor Sun aren't you?"<p>Ranma and Akane went rigid. Ami caught their reaction on the stated question of Hotaru.<p>"Don't try and deny it…I know you two well for that." Hotaru said, before Ranma and Akane could start making any sort of denial.<p>Ami watched the two sighed. 'Akane? Ranma? Are the new senshi?' She decided to voice her own curiosity, "You two are…Vesta and Sun?"<p>Akane turned to look at Ranma, and saw him nod. With another sigh she faced her cousin and Hotaru, "Yes…Ranma and I are the Vesta and Sun…Saturn and Mercury."<p>Ami was shocked, "You knew I was Sailor Mercury?"<p>Ranma and Akane nodded. "I noted your auras. Magic may help hide our identities but it does not mask one's aura. So I knew who the senshi were the moment I recognized your auras." Ranma said.<p>Hotaru happily hugged Akane; happy memories of the Silver Millennium filled her mind as she held on to one of her best friends.<p>Akane returned the hug, "I'm happy to be back too, Alexia. But I need a favor from you two." Seeing Ami and Hotaru nod she continued, "Try and keep this secret for ourselves for the moment. Arthel and I need a little more time for ourselves…we had a very chaotic life back in Nerima, besides…"<p>Ami was listening in attentively, as well as Hotaru.<p>"Don't you like the idea of keeping Setsuna in the dark about this little info?" Akane said with a bemused grin on her face.<p>Hotaru started to giggle.<p>Ami did so as well, 'Now that's something new…a secret kept from the keeper of secrets.' "Well, if it's going to be that way its okay with me, but I think you better share that secret with Rei as well."<p>Akane and Ranma nodded. A few more minutes later, Hotaru wave them goodbye and proceeded to her school. Ranma, Akane and Ami also continued on their way.<p>"Say Ranma?" Akane turned to look at her fiancé. "Would be okay if we go check on Hotaru after school is out? Just in case?"<p>"Sure why not."<p>~ Somewhere ~<p>Cephei was overlooking the progress of the new improved youmas. This new youma would proved to be more powerful than Beryl's seven youmas (you know the ones with the rainbow crystal). 'Progress is at 34%...all is within schedule.' She thought to herself. She wore an armor much like the one Aquilae wore, but only half-plate. And it was more shaped like a leotard than battle armor plating.<p>She turned her head as she felt a new presence enter the room. "Aquilae? By chance are you here to inquire about the Omicron Youmas you requested?"<p>Aquilae nodded, "Yes. Queen Metallia has asked Aurigae to collect energy once again. And I have been deemed to provide another distraction. I would have preferred if I could bring several of these new Omicron Youmas to battle the senshi."<p>Cephei digested this and her mind started to function like clockwork. After all, Cephei is the chief tactician and strategist of the Obsidian Knights, and self-proclaimed genius. "I think I can spare a few. These new improved youma can make the senshi run for their money. And if we get lucky we may bring down one or two of them…not to mention battlefield data results…" Cephei pointed to some chrysalis cells. "Take those twelve with you. They are basically 93% complete. The only thing lacking is the imbued Omicron armoring…but it should prove more than adequate."<p>Aquilae nodded and began to wake the youmas within the cells.<p>'I will prove to the universe that I, Cephei, am the smartest scientist there is…and not that thrice-damned Princess of Mercury!' She crackled with a maniacal laughter, which Aquilae just shrugged.<p>~ Juuban High ~<p>"We have two new transfer students here with us. Please introduce yourselves to the class." Nishimura, homeroom professor, motioned for the transferees to come forward.<p>"Hajimemashite, my name is Saotome Ranma." The pigtailed boy said with a bow and smile (you know…his trademark lady-killer smiles).<p>The girls in the room swooned. Ever since Ranma entered the gates of Juuban High, almost every single head turned to look at him. Girls looked at him with hearts in their eyes, seeing the embodiment of masculinity perfection. And boys looked with those jealous stares, promising pain (A/N: if they only knew ^_^).<p>"Hajimemashite, my name is Tendo Akane. I'm Ami's cousin, and Ranma here is my fiancé." Akane added the last part because she noticed that every single girl in the room (if not in school) had suddenly targeted her fiancé as a possible prospect.<p>There was a big 'awww' from the girl's in the room. But Akane knew, especially regarding Ranma, that most girls won't be disheartened by that so easily. 'I better keep an eye on Ranma…just to be sure.' She added to herself.<p>Ranma was seated next to a window with Akane on his right. Ami was seated next to Akane and Usagi in front of Ranma (as soon as she was allowed to attend class for being late…yet again).<p>School basically went on normally. Ranma and Usagi fell asleep as soon as the teacher began history class, and the sensei found it impossible to wake the young Saotome as he managed to catch every piece of chalk thrown at him while staying asleep. Unfortunately, Usagi never had that talent and she received quite a few dead hits on her forehead.<p>And as usual, Ranma would wake-up just as the lunch bell rang.<p>~~~<p>From the shadows near the school, a figure in black armor rose from the ground. 'Ah, perfect! The school grounds would prove to be an effective means of diversion for the senshi while Aurigae would siphon energy from these humans.'<p>Aquilae held up his hand and a portal opened from behind him. Twelve youmas stepped out from the portal and stood awaiting their orders. "Cause as much damage as you can. And kill the senshi if the situation presents itself."<p>Aquilae decided to stay away from the senshi in this battle. He instead will take the necessary information regarding the senshi's attack power levels and bring it back to Cephei for analysis. 'Only a fool like Beryl would continuously underestimate one's opponent.' He thought then motioned for the youmas to begin their assault.<p>~~~<p>Ranma and Akane were joined in by Ami, Usagi, Minako and Makoto during lunch. To say the least, it had been a little hectic for Ranma and Akane's taste. Several girls attempted to score points at her fiancé by sharing their lunches with him…which prompted Minako to do the same. It took a glare from Ami (which was rare) to stop Minako in her tracks. Several of the boys tried to put the new comer in his _rightful_ place…in the end all they got was their butts kicked so hard they wouldn't be able to sit down for a few hours and as a result the other boys wisely left Ranma alone.<p>Suddenly a commotion was heard near the track and field. Several students were running away from it. "THERE ARE YOUMAS IN THE FIELD!" yelled a student as he raced passed where Ranma and the gang were seated.<p>Ranma and Akane made feint comments on helping the students evacuate. They both gave Ami a nod, who understood the underlying implications.<p>As soon as Ranma and Akane were out of sight, the four went to find a place to transform, whilst Ranma and Akane found a place of their own to change.<p>~~~<p>"RROOAAARRR!"<p>The shed near the field was literally blown down. The twelve rampaging youmas turned the school field into what can be categorized as a war zone. Aquilae hid among the trees to hide himself from the senshi's view.<p>'Soon the senshi will get wind of this…'<p>"HALT!" Sailormoon shouted at the youmas.<p>'…they're faster than I thought…perhaps Vesta had something to do with it…now comes the boring part.' Aquilae summoned from his hand a small crystal and with this crystal he began to record the battle before him.<p>"EEKK!"<p>Sailormoon shrieked as she barely dodged the incoming projectile from one of the youmas.<p>"Be on guard everyone…these are no ordinary youmas…" Mercury began. She lowered her visor so she could get an accurate reading on the youmas and where startled when the power output indicated these to be as least 10 times stronger than the average youma.<p>"In that case…" Jupiter eyed the youma nearest her. "…better up the ante then…JUPITER OAK EVOLUTION!"<p>The youma was struck near its right shoulder (or what passed for a shoulder). There was a gapping wound there but the youma merely shrugged it off and leapt to attack Jupiter.<p>"Whoa! Doesn't that thing feel pain at all?" Jupiter asked as she jumped back, avoiding the monster's pincer-like hands.<p>Ami noted that monster did slow down a little because of the wound, "Apparently they may not feel pain but their reflex and mobility does go down when they get wounded…"<p>The wounded youma moved behind its' brethren. Two more fresh youmas jumped into the fray.<p>"MERCURY AQUA RHAPSODY!"<p>"VENUS LOVE AND BEAUTY SHOCK!"<p>The two youmas were hit dead centered and thrown back and collided with the other youmas.<p>'Hmm…I better suggest to Cephei these youmas might need a little more brain…' Aquilae mentally noted as he saw that the other youmas didn't even bother to dodge their fellows as they were thrown against them.<p>"SOLAR FLARE!"<p>'It would seem that Sun has arrived…but that's funny, where is her lovey-dovey half?'<p>~ Juuban Park ~<p>A scream broke the tranquility of the park. Several youmas (the older type models) emerged from the ground and began attacking the people to siphon their energies.<p>'Good…there are enough people here to provide the necessary energy to heal Queen Metallia's most serious wound…' Aurigae smirked to himself. He wore an exact duplicate of Aquilae's armor, and the only difference is instead of an eagle crest on the breast plate, he had a sword crest.<p>One youma was filled to capacity with siphoned energy and was about to leave when a magical attack slammed it into the ground.<p>Before it could stand another blast hit it, "DEEP SUBMERGE!"<p>The youma dissolved into nothingness whilst the energy it took dissipated into the air.<p>"What the!" Aurigae turned to look at the two new arrivals, Uranus and Neptune. "You people will never get away by siphoning people of their energy. In the name of the princess we will punish you!" Uranus and Neptune shouted at the same time and leapt into the fray.<p>"WORLD SHAKING!"<p>"DEEP SUBMERGE!"<p>Two more youmas fell and the energy they took quickly dissipated.<p>Aurigae was furious; it would seem that not all the scouts went to the school yard. He instructed his remaining youmas to withdraw with whatever energy they manage to take. "Come senshi. I'll be your opponent."<p>Uranus and Neptune were about to bolt after the escaping youma when the heavily armored knight stood to block them.<p>"I'll have your heads for this interruption senshi!" Aurigae spat as he drew his massive sword from it's' scabbard.<p>"Enough talk, WORLD SHAKING!"<p>With a loud kiai, Aurigae brought down his sword in one swift stroke that cut through Uranus attack that cause it split in two and explode in two separate explosions behind him.<p>"Not good enough senshi!"<p>Despite his massive armor, he leapt high into the air towards the direction of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus and Neptune barely managed to dodge in time, as the sword swung merely inches from their faces.<p>"DEEP SUBMERGE!"<p>Again, Aurigae swung his sword and neatly cut the energy attack in two.<p>"DARK CUTTER!"<p>A vacuum wave rippled off Aurigae's sword as he swung his sword in a downward motion.<p>Neptune leapt away but the magical attack cause a large enough explosion behind her to cause her to stumble upon landing.<p>"Die Neptune!"<p>She saw Aurigae smirk as he began to bring down his sword for the killing strike. She closed her eyes, expecting the end to happen but all she heard was a clang.<p>"You won't kill her as long as I live nega-creep!" Uranus said defiantly as she parried the larger sword with her space buster sword.<p>Aurigae smirked more, "Then die with her bitch!" Aurigae applied more force and weight into his sword, forcing Uranus to her knees.<p>"NULL VORTEX!"<p>Aurigae barely had time to see the incoming attack as he was thrown back and imbedded into a wall.<p>"VESTA! YOU SON OF A…"<p>"It seems that you still have a foul mouth Aurigae!" Sailor Vesta said as he landed in front of the two female senshi, cutting of Aurigae's retort short.<p>"Are you two alright?" Vesta asked the two senshi who merely nodded as they stood up.<p>Aurigae pulled himself out of the wall and looked at the three senshi, 'I can handle those two bitches…but that Vesta may be more than what I can take alone.' Aurigae re-sheathed his sword. "This operation has been a total failure. But rest assured we will meet again senshi. Enjoy this victory while it lasts…when Queen Metallia recovers fully…no one in this planet can hope to stop her!" With that said Aurigae teleported away from the battlefield.<p>"Sheesh…foul as ever ain't ya Aurigae…" Vesta shook his head and turned to the other two senshi who were now standing besides him.<p>"Damn that creep managed to take some siphoned energy from those people…" Uranus said as she pointed to the few people lying unconscious at the park.<p>"Yeah…" Vesta said with a sigh. "At least they didn't get the amount they wanted, and that would cause a certain delay to their plans, which buys us some time."<p>Uranus and Neptune nodded.<p>"I'd better go now, and see how the others are doing against Aquilae…" Without waiting for their response, Vesta opened a portal and teleported himself back towards Juuban High.<p>Neptune came to stand beside Uranus, "Should we go there as well?"<p>Uranus shook her head, "Nah, I think the inners can handle it…besides I think that Sun is there with them since I didn't saw her here with Sailor Vesta. We better get back to our classes before our professor finds us missing…"<p>~~~<p>"MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!"<p>The seventh youma fell as Sailormoon's attack slammed against the youma, reducing it to nothingness.<p>The inners, including Sailor Sun, were breathing hard. These youmas were far stronger than the previous ones were, forcing them to use their more powerful attacks which in turn cause them to deplete their reserves faster.<p>Five more youma remained; two were already wounded terribly but still went on fighting as no pain ever registers in their heads. Another had a wound in its left leg evident to its slow response. The other two were still free from any signs of damage as they stood now in front of the senshi.<p>'Hmm…perhaps I can take care of the senshi myself now…they have already depleted their reserves and I don't think they can handle a fully fresh Obsidian Knight as an opponent…'<p>A youma leapt towards Sailormoon, and Sun was about to leapt into the defense of her princess when a rose struck the youma in one its' eyes.<p>"MERCURY AQUA RHAPSODY!"<p>"JUPITER OAK EVOLUTION!"<p>The stunned youma was now thrown back by the combined magical assault and badly wounded.<p>"Tuxedo Kamen!" Sailormoon happily chirped as she latched on her savior.<p>"Are you alright, Sailormoon?" Tuxedo Kamen asked his beloved worriedly.<p>"I'm alright now…"<p>"RRROOAAAAARRRR!"<p>"Uh-oh…I guess they aren't too happy to see you somehow Kamen…" Sun said as she points to the five youma beginning to descend on them.<p>Tuxedo Kamen nodded in response, "I guess they are…."<p>"SPACE PLANAR DIVIDE!"<p>The inners turned to see as the remaining youma were vaporized by the attack of the newly arrived Sailor Vesta.<p>'Wow! He really is strong!' Mercury thought to herself as she saw that it only took one shot from Vesta to take down all five youmas at the same time.<p>'Oh he's such a hunk…*sigh* if only he wasn't taken by Sailor Sun…' Venus thought as she looked at Vesta.<p>'Damn! Vesta had to make an appearance when I could have handled those damn senshi…' Aquilae fumed, but restrained himself.<p>'AQUILAE!' Metallia's voice echoed in Aquilae's head.<p>'My queen?'<p>'THE SENSHI HAS FOILED THE ENERGY GATHERING OPERATION OF AURIGAE…RETURN HERE AT ONCE!'<p>Aquilae grimaced, but nodded and he teleported away from the scene.<p>Sailor Sun went to Vesta and gave him a hug, "You're late!"<p>"Sorry…had to deal with Aurigae back in the park…he was siphoning people there of their energies."<p>The inners and Tuxedo Kamen were shocked.<p>"You mean…this was just…" Ami realized the situation they were just in a few moments ago.<p>"A diversion. I figured out as much. And that's the reason why I didn't come here earlier. Thankfully, Uranus and Neptune were there to delay Aurigae…it seems they figured out as much." Vesta said nonchalantly.<p>"Oh by the way…" Sailormoon started and tugged on Tuxedo Kamen's arm. "This two are the two new senshi I told you about. That is Sailor Sun and the guy is Sailor Vesta."<p>"It's a pleasure to meet you." Kamen said in a causal but friendly manner.<p>Sun and Vesta nodded. "Pleasure is ours too."<p>Vesta turned as he heard sirens fast approaching. "I take it's our cue to split."<p>The others agreed, while the inners and Kamen leapt away, Vesta and Sun teleported some place else to de-transform.<p>To be continued…<p>Author's Notes: I would like to thank all the people who provided feedback and suggestions…especially to LeRoy. Thanks for the suggestion and tips dude!<p>And no, there is no crossover with 'Oh My Goddess' here.
