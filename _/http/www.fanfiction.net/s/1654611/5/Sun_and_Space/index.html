</div>Disclaimer: I don't own either Ranma ½ or Sailormoon...I wish I did so I can skip this part ^_^<p>Sun and Space: Lord Strife (bishop_)<p>'xxx' – Thoughts {xxx} – Panda Signs<p>Version 1.1 Chapter 4<p>~ Rooftops, Juuban Ward ~<p>"So have you gotten any leads?" asked a black cat with a crescent moon symbol on her forehead.<p>Her companion merely shook his head. He too was a cat but of white color and have similar markings on his forehead.<p>Luna sighed. Ever since Usagi, a.k.a. Sailor Moon, told her about the two newly awakened senshi, she had been prowling the<p>night with Artemis in hopes of running across the two...or at least some leads to where they could find them.<p>Among the senshi, aside from Sailor Pluto who was never reincarnated, Sailor Sun and Sailor Vesta seem to recall much of the<p>days of the Silver Millennium faster than when the others were awakened. Since Setsuna was a _little_ reluctant to share<p>information on those matters, she had hoped these two would be much more willing to disclose such details.<p>Artemis sat next to Luna, "I went to Rei and asked her regarding the results of her fire reading...it's quite strange<p>actually..."<p>Luna turned her head to her companion, urging him to continue.<p>"Yesterday, she said she was getting clear readings on the matter...then suddenly today she said it was nil..."<p>Luna looked at him with a curious glare, "...as in, totally nothing?"<p>"Yes."<p>Luna pondered this a little, "That's...weird. I went to check on Ami earlier to see if her Mercury computer found anything...she<p>too said yesterday she was able to get some _probable_ results...but when I asked her again earlier she said she was at a lost.<p>Apparently the result the Mercury computer gave her was so chaotic she could not make a conclusive deduction...whatever that<p>means..."<p>Artemis looked up, "Hmm...did she start fumbling about anything to excuse herself?"<p>Luna looked at him with a startled look, "Now that you mentioned it...yes she did...did Rei acted like that too?"<p>Artemis nodded, "Yes, she did. From what I can tell it's either a coincidence, or those two are hiding something from us."<p>Luna sighed again, "Its hard enough if Pluto hides things from us...but if those two started doing it as well..."<p>"I agree, but let's not jump into conclusions...yet. They may have a good reason for it. Why don't you check out on Ami more<p>and I'll keep a tab on Rei. If they are hiding something..."<p>Luna had to agree, "But be careful...I hear Rei's cousin is extremely scared of cats...if he gets a whiff of you..."<p>"I'll be careful. So do we stake out tonight or tomorrow?"<p>~ Tendo Residence, Nerima Ward ~<p>Nabiki sat on a chair beside her bedroom's window, apparently in deep thought. 'A couple...one having an arrogant demeanor...the<p>other a fiery temper... And probably lives somewhere in Juuban.' She silently chuckles. 'If I didn't know any better I<p>would have said it was Ranma and Akane...but apparently she said those two are deeply in love with each other...so it couldn't be<p>Ranma and Akane...would it?'<p>Nabiki turned to her ledger, the woman Setsuna said no price is too high, just that she finds where a certain 'Arthel' and<p>'Lithea' reside. She even gave a down payment of 500,000 yen and another when Nabiki finds them.<p>"Hmm...since Akane is in Juuban, perhaps I can ask her and see if she knows any other couple like that..." Nabiki paused.<p>"And I better make sure it isn't them as well."<p>~ Hikawa Shrine, Juuban Ward ~<p>Ranma was on the roof, lying on his back gazing up at the stars at the night sky. He turned to his left and saw Akane came<p>up the roof and gently walked towards him.<p>Akane stop and sat next to him, "Just got a call from Nabiki."<p>Ranma raised an eye-brow, "What? Did any of Nerima Wrecking Crew found us already?"<p>Akane shook her head and failed to stifle a giggle. "Nah, she was asking if we knew of any other couple here in Juuban that<p>had similar personalities to our own."<p>"Why would she want...that..." Ranma stopped then grinned.<p>"Setsuna!" Both said at the same time.<p>"I guess we better be doubly careful, unless Nabiki stumbles upon our little secret."<p>Akane nodded in agreement.<p>"Say, Akane?"<p>"Yes?"<p>"Don't you find it weird?"<p>She turned to her fiancé with a look of non-understanding, "Weird? What's weird?"<p>"About us..." Ranma said nonchalantly. "...we died a month before the other senshi did, and I'm quite certain that Queen<p>Serenity did not send us to the future...otherwise Setsuna would have searched for us as well."<p>Akane pondered this a little, "Now that you mentioned it...and also, our memories aren't as Swiss-cheesed like the others<p>were..." Akane regarded Ranma with a thoughtful look. "You're saying...there was another force that had power to do so?"<p>Ranma shrugged, "Probably. For reasons I have no idea..."<p>Akane began to stand, "We can ask Rei or Ami about that...maybe they can get some info or something."<p>Ranma nodded, he too stood up. He was walking towards the edge of the roof when he suddenly stopped. Akane noticed this,<p>"What's wrong?"<p>"C-cc-cat..."<p>Akane began frantically looking in every direction, "Where? I can't see a cat anywhere?"<p>"No...I...felt one approaching...it...has...an aura..."<p>Akane looked at him puzzled, "Aura? That cat must be magical in nature if you could sense it..."<p>Ranma nodded then another memory hit his head. "Artemis..."<p>"Who?" Akane asked.<p>"One of Queen Serenity's advisors...c-cat advisors...Artemis...you know the white c-cat..."<p>Akane seemed to stop at that, then her face lights up as she recalls who Artemis was. "Artemis...so is he the one you sensed?"<p>Ranma frantically nodded, while gazing around as if expecting the white cat to pop out of nowhere.<p>"If I remember correctly, the other cat advisor was named...Luna!"<p>Ranma again nodded, "Why did they have to be c-cats..."<p>Akane sighed, "I wonder if those two cats know how to cure Neko-ken..." Akane shook her head, "In any case we better be<p>careful not to talk too much about anything senshi-related or those two will start telling the others...and the moment they<p>do...I bet Setsuna would be knocking on our doorsteps in an instant."<p>Ranma had to agree, "Better tell Rei to be extra careful though, I think they may be on to us."<p>Ranma and Akane soon went down the roof and headed inside just as Artemis arrived. And from a certain distance from the<p>shrine three figures, female judging from their silhouettes in the shadows left quietly muttering something like "...a greater<p>threat than Metallia..."<p>~ Somewhere ~<p>Cephei studied the battle data Aquilae had procured during their last encounter with the senshi. 'Hmm...perhaps I can enhance<p>the youmas' intelligence factor by 32%...that will give them enough brains to think without making them totally sentient.'<p>She walked towards a newly competed Omicron youma, complete with the omicron organic armoring. 'I can modify this one's<p>intelligence, and send it to battle the senshi.' A small wicked smile crept to her face. 'Yes, I will prove I am the<p>smartest individual in this universe!' Her mad laughter echoed within the confines of her lab.<p>~ Mizuno Residence ~<p>Ami was staring outside her window, she had just waked up from a dream...no, it was more of a long forgotten memory. She<p>whispered something barely audible, "Arthel..."<p>~ Past...Silver Millennium, Flowing Silver Palace of Planet Mercury ~<p>A huge celebration was being held at the royal palace. The kingdom was celebrating the appointment of Princess Melira as<p>Sailor Mercury, and no quarter was spared for the occasion.<p>Melira just sighed. She was happy to be able to bring honor to the family by being named Sailor Mercury...but she just hated<p>parties. It's not she dislikes happy occasions...it's just she's so shy she hardly feels comfortable among many people. But<p>her mother insisted that she come, after all she is the reason for the celebration and besides, since she is now Sailor<p>Mercury she should get used to people since she will be spending a lot of time protecting the citizens of the Silver<p>Millennium.<p>"Princess, time to come down to the banquet hall!" said a servant as she politely entered her young mistress' room.<p>"Tell father and mother I'll be in a little while."<p>With a small gesture from her, the servant retreated to tell her parents that she will be along in a few moments.<p>*Sigh* "Guess better get it over with I think..." With one final adjustment to her dress, she left for the banquet halls.<p>She took her time walking through the corridors; she stopped halfway to her destination having second thoughts on joining the<p>festivities.<p>"I...I don't think they'd mind if I don't come..." she whispered to herself. Unknowns to her, another person heard her soft<p>whisper.<p>"Of course they would mind, after all you are the very reason for this occasion Princess Melira." said a male voice from<p>behind her, which nearly made her jump out of her clothes.<p>Melira whirled around to see a young man around her age or so, dressed in formal attire. She regarded his face and saw a<p>cocky smile on his handsome face made her blush a little. She then tore her gaze off of him and shook her head slightly.<p>'What am I thinking?' She thought to herself.<p>She eventually regained her composure, and immediately recognizes the other person's regal emblem. "Forgive me for my<p>rudeness, you are Prince Arthel of Vesta and its' appointed senshi are you not?" Melira said with a slight formal bow, given<p>to another person of similar stature.<p>"That I am." Arthel returned her bow. He smiled at her causing her to blush even more. "Why won't you come to the banquet<p>halls?"<p>She lost a little of her smile as she turned to face the doors to the hall.  "It's just...I don't like being with too many<p>people..."<p>"Why is that?"<p>"It's just...that...I'm shy...of other people...it...also makes me...feel uncomfortable."<p>Arthel shook his head slightly, "Better get used to it princess. After all you are now one of Queen Serenity's senshi and<p>you would be dealing with a lot of people...and most will not be as polite as the people in there right now."<p>"I know...but still..."<p>"Think of this as a little training for you...it may help you a little in dealing with other people, and..."<p>"And?"<p>"Never think you are alone. I and the other senshi will not hesitate to be there for you."<p>Somehow what Arthel said made her blush.<p>"Arthel! Melira!" A voice was heard from behind them, and they turned to see Princess Lithea running towards them.<p>"Lithea!" Melira squealed happily as she hugged her distant cousin. "It's been so long since I last saw you!"<p>"I know, been busy really. I have been looking for Arthel here because your mother asked me to look for you since you<p>haven't shown up at the halls yet."<p>Melira looked abashed, "I'm sorry...it's just..."<p>"Still don't like being in a crowd eh?"<p>Princess of Mercury merely nodded.<p>"Don't worry, Melira. You'll get used to it."<p>Melira couldn't help but noticed as to how close her cousin was standing next to Arthel was.<p>"Umm...you two seemed very close."<p>Arthel and Lithea blushed as her comment. "Actually..." Lithea started "He's my fiancé. He asked me last week if I wanted to<p>marry him and I said yes."<p>The two looked lovingly into each other as they failed to notice a look of disappointment flooded Melira's face.<p>'Guess he was taken already, by my cousin no less...*sigh* She cleared her throat as to get the attention of the other two.<p>"I'm happy for the both of you! Congratulations Lithea!" She hugged her cousin again. "So when's the wedding?"<p>The three started talking about the imminent occasion as they walked towards the banquet halls.<p>~ Mizuno Residence ~<p>Ami just sighed; she remembered how her past self felt about Arthel...Ranma. She hid her feelings then because she cared too<p>much for her cousin too and it was also because she saw the way Arthel looked at Lithea that made her decide not to<p>interfere.<p>'It was like that then...it's still is now...those two are still very much in love with each other.'<p>Ami shook her head to clear it of confusing thoughts. She took one last glance outside before deciding to sleep again. This<p>time it was a dreamless sleep.<p>Unknown to her, Luna watched her from the tree outside. 'Seems like Ami just had a dream of the old Silver Millennium...I<p>wonder if I should ask her about it?' Luna pondered this for a moment before she left, heading back towards the Tsukino<p>residence.<p>~ Hikawa Shrine, midnight ~<p>Grandfather Hino was making late night rounds in the shrine to ensure everything was in order since his disciple Yuuichirou<p>was out of town. He paused momentarily as he neared the sacred fire. He smiled inwardly, guessing who was the one<p>meditating in front of the sacred fire.<p>He walked in slowly into the room, "You should be resting now Rei. You have school tomorrow." He paused, then corrected<p>himself "Make that later, since it's already morning."<p>Rei opened her eyes slowly. She felt her grandfather's presence even before he entered the room, so she wasn't surprised by<p>his voice at all. "I'll be done in a minute grandfather."<p>"What's keeping you awake dear?" the elder Hino asked.<p>"Nothing really grandfather...Ranma just taught me some methods of ki- manipulation that I could use during my fire-readings and<p>I'm currently trying it out."<p>"Is that so? Was it any help?"<p>Rei nodded, "Quite really. I never got such clear readings before. He said the method he taught me was just the first step.<p>Other more complex meditations are to follow once I fully master this one."<p>Grandfather Hino nodded with pride. His grandchildren were exceptional indeed. His grandson was a top caliber martial<p>artist that has incorporated ki-techniques into the art. While his granddaughter was no martial artist, she was no slacker<p>in terms of ki-meditations and was even quick to learn from her cousin. "That's all well and good Rei. But even shrine<p>maidens need their rest. Now off to bed!"<p>"Yes grandfather."<p>Grandfather Hino left. He knows Rei will not leave the sacred fire until she feels she has done all what she can, and right<p>now it may be a while before she goes to bed. He never lost his smile as he continues his rounds. "Those young ones are all<p>too alike. They are always in a rush."<p>Rei was left in the sacred fire. She continued her fire-readings. She felt another force...something very powerful...yet so<p>kind and gentle at the same time. 'Ranma and Akane said that they died a month before the fall of the Silver Millennium...so<p>it couldn't be Queen Serenity that sent them to the future...but another force...the one I'm feeling now.' She shook her head<p>to clear it of all distractions. What she told her grandfather was true, she has now much clearer image in her readings than<p>before but...this entity with such power and such gentleness she could not point out.<p>'Heh, if I didn't know better I'm guessing is that the kami themselves are blocking my fire-readings.' She laughs a little<p>on that private joke. 'Guess grandfather is correct, I do need my sleep. Perhaps Ranma can help me with other meditation<p>techniques and see if I can finally see who or what this force is.'<p>She gave one final respect to the scared fire before she left the room. After she has gone, a quiet whisper could be heard<p>from the sacred fire: 'It's not yet time for you to know us, Rei. But soon...perhaps...'<p>~ Gates of Time ~<p>Sailor Pluto was still watching the wild fluctuation of the future. Crystal Tokyo and Metallia's unmentionable alternative.<p>Still she felt something like confidence that they can make it out in one piece. After all, the senshi are now virtually<p>complete. Powers of the elements are at their disposal, not to mention the combined powers of Time and Space.<p>Her thoughts lingered to that of Vesta and Sun. 'You can run but you can't hide forever you two!' She smiled. She had<p>forgotten how much it felt good when you smile. Her smile was lost when she looked at the wild fluctuation. A third<p>probable outcome manifested itself. She gasped at what she saw.<p>"By the gods! It...it couldn't be!"<p>Then she noticed the original two visions gradually was ceding against the third future. Before she could react a portal<p>opened itself in front of her, and out step a man dressed in regal armor.<p>"You shall not interfere in our affairs mortal." The stranger said casually.<p>Sailor Pluto prepared to battle the stranger, but was caught unaware of his speed. Before she could react, she finds herself<p>thrown out of the Gates of Time. "What the..."<p>"Be thankful I did not kill you mortal. Your future has been decided." The Gates of Time slowly closed while Sailor Pluto<p>sat there, watching helplessly.<p>~ Next Morning, en route to Juuban High ~<p>Ranma, Akane, and Ami were walking together towards Juuban High, after seeing Hotaru off to her school.<p>"I still say we should ask Haruka and Michiru to transfer Hotaru to Juuban High so at least we can watch over her."<p>Ranma shook his head, Lithea...Akane can be so over-protective sometimes.<p>Ami merely giggled, "So...did you two study for our history test today?"<p>Akane nodded but soon noticed Ranma stiffened. "Don't tell me you forgot Ranma?"<p>Ranma merely grunted, and Akane slapped her forehead. "Baka!"<p>Usagi chose that moment to appear (To know why she is early? Hard to say...she's harder to predict than a Tornado would appear<p>^_^). "Ohayou, minna-san!" She gleefully greets her friends.<p>"Ohayou, Usagi-chan." Akane and Ami chorused together.<p>Usagi smiled but notices Ranma's distress. "Umm...what's wrong with Ranma?"<p>"Apparently..." Akane began, "He forgot to study for our history test."<p>Usagi nodded, but soon Akane's word struck home. "WE HAVE A TEST?"<p>Everyone within a five-mile radius could have sworn they heard a sonic boom pass over them.<p>~~~<p>After calming down a crying Usagi, Ranma and the others continued to school.<p>"I think I'm not feeling well..."<p>"Nice try Usagi. But you won't get off the hook that easy." Akane said grimly.<p>Ami merely smiled, while stealing glances at Ranma.<p>They were close to school when they noticed Setsuna leaning heavily against the wall, she was apparently breathing hard.<p>"Setsuna!" Ami and Usagi called out as they ran towards her. Ranma and Akane followed suit.<p>"What happened to you?" Ami asked.<p>"Setsuna eyed Ranma and Akane briefly, "Umm. It's kind of _private_, perhaps later."<p>Ami and Usagi understood what she meant by private. Ranma and Akane too, but did not show it in their faces. And Ami knew<p>that Ranma and Akane would understand as well.<p>"I see...well we better get you to the school clinic then. Ranma how about some help?"<p>Ranma nodded at Ami's instruction and help Setsuna up.<p>'Who ever did this to Setsuna would have to be extremely good.' This though echoed in the minds of the four teens.<p>'Hmmm...now that I think about it...Rei's cousin Ranma looks familiar...' is what's echoing in Setsuna's mind.<p>~ Juuban Museum ~<p>Cephei emerged from the shadows. 'Good...more than enough people to cause a commotion to acquire the senshi's notice.' She<p>motioned to her omicron youma to begin its attack.<p>People's screams and Cephei's mad laughter filled the museum's halls.<p>To be continued...<p>Author's Notes: Up next, the Nerima Wrecking crew finally makes their debut...will Ryouga survive Akane's wrath? Oh and<p>Happy Easter!
