</div>Eight years after the battle of Mount Phoenix...<p>"Is Ranma coming today, Onee-chan?"<p>"Hai, she should be here sometime soon, Akane-chan," Kasumi<br/>smiles as she squeezes her sister's hand. "And by the way, she..."<p>"Hai, I know," Akane impishly smiles, playfully batting her<br/>sister's hand away. Kasumi is quick to sense the mirth in Akane's<br/>voice. "She goes by 'Kikuko' now. You've told me that many times,<br/>Onee-chan."<p>Both laugh. It's a warm day, allowing the youngest Tendou to<br/>relax outside the hospital in her pyjamas, a housecoat and her<br/>slippers, though she is forced to remain in her wheelchair.<br/>The aneurysm that nearly killed Akane while she had been training<br/>in the dojo had damaged her spinal cord and certain elements of her<br/>brain. Effectively crippling her, it had also left her with partial<br/>amnesia - permanently, her doctor had warned Kasumi as soon as it<br/>was diagnosed. While it had delivered a brutal blow to Akane's<br/>volatile temper, that it had also done THIS to her...<p>"Akane! Kasumi!"<p>Both look over as a lovely vision in a white sundress, sandals<br/>and sparsely applied makeup, earrings and a bracelet, appears.<br/>"Kikuko!" Kasumi rises as the arriving redhead walks up to embrace<br/>her.<p>"Ranma!" Akane automatically calls out, opening her arms.<p>Kasumi stares at her sister, causing the new arrival to laugh.<br/>"Oh, relax, Kasumi!" Kikuko playfully bats the Tendou matriarch's<br/>nose, then leans down to embrace Akane. "Hey, how's my favourite<br/>girl today?"<p>"I've missed you, Ran-..." Akane then catches herself before<br/>gazing into the redhead's glittering sapphire eyes. "Kikuko-chan!"<p>"Well, you won't miss me anymore, Akane-chan," Kikuko rises,<br/>warmly holding Akane's hands. "I just got finished with the bank<br/>arranging for the modifications to my place to be paid off right<br/>away. Soon as we talk to your doctors, you're out of this dungeon<br/>once and for all."<p>Akane blinks, then her eyes widen. "Leaving...?"<p>"You bet! Unless you WANT to stay here..."<p>"NO!"<p>Kikuko ducks. "Didn't think so," she winks at Kasumi.<p>The Tendou matriarch laughs...<p>* * *<p>A meeting with Akane's personal physician is arranged, then<br/>Kikuko goes to work discussing the crippled girl's needs, things<br/>such as nursing care, medication, check-ups and transportation.<br/>Watching the redhead negotiate with Waka-sensei, Kasumi quivers<br/>with pride. Kikuko Hayashi - idol star extraordinary, movie actress<br/>working both sides of the Pacific Ocean, not to mention budding<br/>social activist. Long burned out of her heart and soul was the shy,<br/>stammering man/woman-child who had first appeared at the front<br/>doorstep of the Tendou dojo a lifetime ago, slung over the shoulder<br/>of what seemed a well-trained panda.<p>Ranma...<p>Kasumi closes her eyes. To believe that after over a year of<br/>sacrifice, things ended up like they did. To believe that after<br/>Ranma had done the one thing true martial artists dreaded to do - to<br/>actually KILL someone in cold blood, even if said target was, in the<br/>eyes of many, evil incarnate - her family "honoured" Ranma's<br/>sacrifice by throwing her into the streets. To believe that, even<br/>after pronouncing Ranma to be "manly" the day she finally learned<br/>of her son's curse, Nodoka just turned around and disowned her child<br/>when it appeared that Happousai's "revenge" would leave Ranma a woman<br/>forever. To believe that no one had tried to...!<p>To...<p>"Mrs. Ono?"<p>Kasumi jolts, then sighs. "Oh, gomen, Sensei! I was..."<p>"It's alright," Hirosuke Waka chuckles. "I was wondering<br/>if you have any sort of objections concerning your sister's homecare<br/>with Hayashi-san."<p>"Ah! Oh, no, no, of course not!" Kasumi shakes her head.<br/>"Kikuko-san and I've discussed this beforehand, Sensei. It's<br/>alright."<p>"Alright, then," he nods. "What of Akane's other relatives?"<p>Kasumi stiffens. "Father is dead, Sensei. Even if I have the<br/>Ono name, I am the head of the Nerima Tendou Clan due to what<br/>happened to Akane. As for our sister Nabiki, her opinions..."<br/>she pauses, then finishes her sentence in a voice of ashes. "No<br/>longer matter."<p>"I see," the doctor nods. "Well, let's get everything set<br/>up..."<p>* * *<p>An hour later...<p>"Nabiki did a lot of bad things, didn't she, Onee-chan?"<p>"Hai, that she did," Kasumi nods as the sisters and Kikuko ride<br/>a limousine to the actress' penthouse home in Shibuya.<p>"How long do they say she'll stay in jail?" Kikuko wonders.<p>She and Kasumi exchange a knowing look. "For quite some time<br/>to come," the Tendou matriarch reports. "Much that we did benefit<br/>greatly from her..." she pauses, "...activities, that she didn't<br/>break some of those habits when she went into business full-time<br/>was regrettable."<p>"You reap what you sow," Kikuko glances out the window.<p>"Hai, that you do," Kasumi nods.<p>"You won't throw her out of the house when she comes back, will<br/>you, Onee-chan?" Akane gazes curiously at her sister.<p>"There's no house for her to return to, Akane," Kasumi returns<br/>her look with a warm smile. "Once Father was dead and Kikuko-chan<br/>offered to take care of you, there was no need to hang onto it<br/>anymore. We were able to sell it off to those who'd put it to far<br/>better use."<p>"But what about Nabiki, Onee-chan?"<p>"Relax, Akane," Kikuko gently grasps her ex-fiancee's<br/>hand. "She's a big girl now. She'll be able to take care of herself<br/>when she gets out."<p>Akane gives her a wary look, then nods. "If you say so..."<p>"Ah, we're here!"<p>The limousine turns into a basement parking lot, then drives<br/>up to a private elevator lobby. Kikuko and Kasumi get out, then<br/>after Akane's wheelchair is unfolded, the younger Tendou is put into<br/>it. Boarding the car, they ascend to the top floor, then step out<br/>into a lobby with a single set of double doors and a doorman.<br/>"Afternoon, Miss Hayashi," he bows, then glances at the woman in the<br/>chair. "And this must be Miss Tendou."<p>"It sure is!" Kikuko grins as the doors are opened, revealing<br/>a fair-sized yet modestly decorated studio flat.<p>"Wow!" Akane breathes in...<p>* * *<p>Later...<p>"She's asleep now."<p>"That's good," Kasumi sighs, gazing out the picture windows<br/>onto the Tokyo cityscape. "This must have set you back quite a bit,<br/>Kikuko-chan."<p>"Not as much as you might think," Kikuko, now dressed in a<br/>button shirt and slacks, sits in an armchair. Kasumi places herself<br/>in the sofa opposite her host. "The owner of the building's<br/>a fan of mine, so he let me rent this place at a discount. Land<br/>prices in this town are still high as the sky, so I can appreciate<br/>the sacrifice he's made for me."<p>Silence falls as Kasumi takes that in, then she glances anew at<br/>her host. "What about the two fellows who came to the house?"<p>"Gone."<p>"How?"<p>"Do you want to ask?"<p>They gaze at each other, then Kasumi shakes her head. "No,"<br/>she gazes once more out the window. "As distasteful as it was, it<br/>was also necessary, especially after what happened to Akane-chan."<p>"Why didn't you do something about it sooner, Kasumi?"<p>"Father forbade it, of course," a tinge of bitterness seeps into<br/>the older woman's voice. "Blinded himself to the fact that Akane<br/>was just getting worse day after day, regardless if she needed an<br/>emotional 'vent' for her feelings or not. At first, I thought it was<br/>just left-over grief from Mother's death that made her so mad at<br/>times, but..."<p>"Yeah, I know," Kikuko nods. "Did anyone else try to help?"<p>"Ryouga-kun did - until Akane learned the truth about P-chan."<p>The redhead winces. "Ouch! I'm glad that U-chan, Shan and<br/>'Dachi weren't close by whenever Akane had to blow off some steam."<p>"I never found out what happened to them after you left," Kasumi<br/>crosses her arms. "Father even forbade Nabiki from keeping an eye on<br/>you or the others after you were forced out of the house. Are they<br/>alright?"<p>"Oh, they're just great!" Kikuko grins. "U-chan told her dad<br/>what happened and he let her off the hook on the spot. She moved<br/>back to Kyoto to operate her business there. Now she's got U-chan's<br/>franchises from Kinki straight down to Okinawa, even places in<br/>Korea." A pause, then, "Since I killed Saffron and Happousai,<br/>the Amazons decided to adopt me as a sister into the tribe. Means<br/>I got to spend one month every summer in the village, but it's<br/>alright in the end. Hibaa-chan's taught me a lot..."<p>"I noticed. You pronounce her name 'Shan' instead of 'Sham.'"<p>"Hai, true. Anyhow, Shan and I are blood sisters now..."<p>"'Blood sisters?'"<p>"Hai. There's this seldom-used law that permits outsider<br/>mates to become adopted sisters or brothers of the tribe whenever<br/>the Nanniichuan or Nyanniichuan gets involved. Also gave me the<br/>right to choose my ex's new husband, believe it or not," Kikuko<br/>crosses her arms.<p>Kasumi gapes. "Did you choose...?"<p>"Hell, no! Of course not!" the redhead smirks, then sighs.<br/>"Kasumi, after all I went through because of arranged marriages,<br/>did you HONESTLY suspect that I'd do something like that, even to<br/>Shan?"<p>Silence falls as the Tendou matriarch considers that, then she<br/>shakes her head. "No, of course not. What about Kodachi?"<p>"Well, when she learned the truth about my curse - atop hearing<br/>what Jijii did to me to get his 'revenge' on Oyaji and Souun - she<br/>was willing to help right away," Kikuko sighs, a twinkle flashing<br/>in her eyes. "At first, it was to spite ol' Bokken-for-Brains<br/>and Mister Coconuts since they didn't like me whatsoever. But as<br/>time went on, we became friends. When I finally got my break in the<br/>pictures, I helped pay for her to spend some time at the Betty Ford<br/>Clinic in the States. After she got out, we teamed up on her brother<br/>and dad, then got them both sent in for treatment."<p>"And?"<p>"They're still there."<p>Kasumi giggles, politely covering her mouth, then she sighs,<br/>her eyes turning to her lap. "I overheard Genma telling Father one<br/>day a few years ago that you had been adopted into the Hayashi Clan<br/>of Aomori after you left us so you wouldn't be ronin. Were they<br/>another of Genma's victims?"<p>"Hai. Have a very nice daughter named Taeko; she's into<br/>aikidou, naginata-dou, kyuudou and t'ae kwondo. It would've been a<br/>nice match had I stayed a boy. She..." Kikuko sighs. "She's just<br/>as understanding as you are, Kasumi. You'd get along a lot. I'll<br/>introduce you to her sometime."<p>"I'd like that," Kasumi nods. "I think they deserve both thanks<br/>and an apology from us for what brought you back to their<br/>doorsteps..."<p>Kikuko makes a dismissive wave. "Don't worry about it, Kasumi.<br/>When they got the whole story about what Oyaji and Nodoka did, they<br/>adopted me on the spot, then sponsored my going to the States to get<br/>my degree and get into Hollywood. In their eyes, it was the ultimate<br/>slap in the face to all that Nodoka tried to do since - as they all<br/>saw it, even U-chan's dad! - the Saotomes were 'running away' from<br/>their honourable obligations."<p>"I doubt Nodoka would've taken that very well."<p>"Naturally. It was Taeko-chan who destroyed her sword."<p>Kasumi gapes. "REALLY?"<p>"Hai. Want to know what she told Nodoka when it happened?"<p>"What?"<p>"'A family without honour has no right to an honour blade.'"<p>Kasumi blinks, then nods approvingly. "It was about time she<br/>was made to see the truth," she crosses her arms.<p>"You sure Nabiki won't try to find out what really happened?"<p>"Do you think she'll learn that it was you who exposed her using<br/>Genma's Umisen-ken techniques?" Kasumi returns Kikuko's look.<p>"She's a smart girl, Kasumi."<p>"Hai, true, but I think a decade in jail might make her change<br/>her mind about a lot of things," Kasumi's eyes narrow.<p>"Touche..."<p>* * *<p>An hour later, Kasumi departs the actress' home, heading to the<br/>basement where the limousine awaited her, ready to return her to<br/>Toofuu's side in Hachiouji. As the car slips back into traffic,<br/>Kasumi then calls out, "Can you take me to the site of the Tendou<br/>dojo in Nerima, driver?"<p>"Yes, ma'am!" he nods.<p>Within an hour, the limousine makes its way through the streets<br/>of Nerima. Fortunately, the vehicle, though large as Japanese<br/>cars came, was still agile enough to negotiate the odd tight corner<br/>or two. In the proverbial blink of the eye, Kasumi finds herself<br/>staring at an empty lot with its surrounding walls knocked down, a<br/>burn-tinged hole in the ground and a dried-up koi pond the only marks<br/>which indicated where her family home had once been. Even the sakura<br/>trees had been cut down, she notes...<p>** ** **<p>Six months ago...<p>"OH, SAOTOME, IT'S HORRIBLE! JUST HORRIBLE!"<p>"There, there, Tendou-kun," Genma patted his best friend's<br/>shoulder as they and Nodoka sat around the living room table. "I'm<br/>sure it'll be alright! Your daughter'll be able to get out of this<br/>soon enough!"<p>Souun moaned, his tears showering everywhere. Fortunately,<br/>too few of them fell on Genma to trigger his transformation.<br/>Watching her father make a fool of himself from the kitchen, where<br/>she had been called back to by Souun for this evening's meet with the<br/>Saotomes, Kasumi frowns. A quick glance to Nodoka revealed a<br/>sympathetic look on the older woman's face for Souun's plight.<br/>"Father, would you want more tea?" she called out, hoping deep down<br/>to get the stupid fool to finally shut up and act his age.<p>If that was even possible, of course...<p>"P-please..." Souun whispered, then launched into another wail.<p>Nodoka sighed as she rose, following Kasumi into the kitchen.<br/>"You father is very distraught," the former mused. "First the<br/>accident with Akane-chan, now this. What exactly happened to<br/>Nabiki-chan, anyway?"<p>"From what I understand, Saotome-san, it appears that despite<br/>her success in starting her own business, Nabiki held onto certain<br/>habits she should have let go of when she graduated high school,"<br/>Kasumi flatly noted. "As much as I care for her, I can't condone<br/>that sort of behaviour."<p>She didn't have to look on Nodoka to see the older woman's<br/>frown. Ever since THAT day, Kasumi had refused to address the<br/>Saotome matriarch as anything other than family name and the basic<br/>honorific; Genma got the same treatment. Neither of Ranma's parents<br/>had been invited to Kasumi's wedding three years beforehand despite<br/>all of Souun's protests to the contrary; it was only a threat of<br/>elopement and a permanent break between Kasumi and the rest of the<br/>family that made him lay off. "So when is the trial?" Nodoka then<br/>asked. "We should be there for Nabiki-chan at least."<p>"Soon, I suspect," Kasumi glanced at the watch. Ah, perfect.<p>The doorbell. Kasumi walked out of the kitchen, then headed<br/>onto the porch. A minute later, she returned, two plain-dressed<br/>men following her. Seeing their general demeanor, the older people<br/>in the house were quick to suspect who they might be. "Souun<br/>Tendou?" the older of them drew out a small black book with the<br/>Imperial chrysanthemum on it.<p>"Uh, y-yes..." Souun stammered. "And you are?"<p>"Inspector Akira Hojou of the Special Crimes Unit, Tokyo<br/>Metropolitan Police," he nodded curtly. "This is my partner,<br/>Detective Chiaki Aoki. We came to speak to you about your daughter,<br/>Nabiki, sir..."<p>* * *<p>Later...<p>"You've investigated her for THREE YEARS?"<p>"That's correct, sir," Hojou grimly nodded, then sipped the tea<br/>automatically offered by Kasumi. "From what we've ascertained<br/>so far, your daughter's behaviour stemmed from illegal and<br/>quasi-legal activities she was involved in while still attending<br/>Furinkan High School. We need this information to better build a<br/>psychological profile on her..."<p>"She never did anything wrong!" Souun vehemently stated.<p>"Sir, as much as I am sympathetic to your plight, any denials<br/>you might make, either now or at your daughter's trial, will not do<br/>her any good in the long term," Hojou gave him a knowing look, then<br/>he placed the tea cup on the table. "From what I've learned through<br/>those other people we've interviewed - her former classmates<br/>and boyfriends, plus other friends and acquaintances - she initially<br/>acted to help keep your family financially solvent. In fact, so<br/>we've learned from her directly, she hands you a considerable<br/>amount of cash every month to pay for expenses incurred by this<br/>household, expenses not augmented by any income generated here. This<br/>IS a dojo, is it not? Why don't you have students?"<p>"I..." Souun trembled, then sighed, gazing at the table. "I've<br/>not taught students for so long now. Not since my wife died..."<p>"That was eighteen years ago, sir," Aoki noted. "What of your<br/>younger daughter, Akane? Why has she not been given control of the<br/>dojo and allowed to seek out her own students? Is she not...?"<p>"N-no! A-akane-chan had an accident sometime ago..."<p>Hojou: "Sir, I'd hardly call a brain aneurysm an 'accident.'"<p>"B-but..."<p>"It wasn't."<p>"Kasumi!" Souun spun on his daughter.<p>Kasumi glared her father into silence, then faced the policemen.<br/>"Inspector, there are many things I can say about life in this<br/>household. Ever since Mother died, Father has done nothing to help<br/>keep this house, much less try to better our lives. Nabiki, for all<br/>her faults, was the real breadwinner in this family. Yes, she<br/>engaged in very questionable acts since she was old enough to do such<br/>and understand the potential consequences. Does that make her an<br/>evil person? I can't answer that. Only a public trial can do that.<br/>But regardless of her actions, she always kept her family's welfare<br/>first and foremost in her mind."<p>Silence fell over the room. Souun gazed at his oldest, a<br/>mixture of emotions tugging at his face. Genma remained silent;<br/>he had long since come to understand the truths haunting the Tendou<br/>household. Nodoka's lips twisted in disapproval; regardless<br/>of Nabiki's actions, Kasumi had no right to defy her father in front<br/>of strangers, even the public authorities.<p>"I see, then," Hojou sighed, then stared intently at Souun.<br/>"You actually ALLOWED your daughter to sink deeper and deeper into<br/>that morass, yet didn't lift a FINGER to try to get her out of it?"<br/>Taking a deep breath, he gazed knowingly at his partner. "Perhaps<br/>we should have the incident concerning your youngest daughter<br/>investigated, also..."<p>"Th-that's not necessary...!" Souun sputtered.<p>"Father, you can't deny the truth anymore!"<p>"Kasumi!" Souun shrieked, spinning on her.<p>Before his hand could lash out, the ominous *click-click!*<br/>of a firearm's hammer being pulled into the "ready" position froze<br/>him in place. Turning to Aoki, Souun paled on seeing the detective's<br/>automatic aimed his way. Nodoka was white-faced at the sight while<br/>Genma looked ready to bolt and run. "Now, that'll be enough of<br/>that," Aoki warned. "I'm sure Mrs. Ono's husband would not approve<br/>one bit of your behaviour, especially since she clearly desires<br/>to speak the truth about events in this house. Put your hands on the<br/>table where we can see them, Tendou-san. And if you try to hurt your<br/>child again, maybe we'll run you in for assault-and-battery."<p>Souun shuddered, then quickly collapsed into a heap of tears.<br/>Genma moved to comfort him as Aoki lowered his weapon. "Now, Mrs.<br/>Ono, why don't you tell us about what happened to your other sister?"<br/>Hojou bid.<p>Kasumi nodded. The explanation took about ten minutes. On the<br/>mention of a particular name associated with Akane, Genma's eyes<br/>widened in shock. Nodoka remained icily calm on hearing Ranma's<br/>name, but Kasumi was quick to tell that having this part of her<br/>family's past dredged up again was quite discomforting. At the end<br/>of it, a thoughtful look crossed Hojou's face, then he gazed on the<br/>Saotomes. "Ranma Saotome? Your son?"<p>"No," Nodoka answered automatically. "We have no son."<p>"They renounced and abandoned him eight years ago," Kasumi<br/>added.<p>"Kasumi!" Souun gagged. "You can't..."<p>"Can't WHAT?" Kasumi spun on her father.<p>"Enough!" Nodoka snapped. "Kasumi-chan, you have no right to<br/>speak out about that! You will remain silent about this...!"<p>The sharp *CRACK!* of a fist slamming into Nodoka's cheek caused<br/>everyone to spin on Kasumi as the older woman is flung back a metre<br/>or so from the table. As Nodoka collapsed, Souun spun on his<br/>daughter, his whole body quaking from the storm of conflicting<br/>emotions tonight's meeting was creating. "HOW DARE YOU HIT OUR<br/>GUEST? APOLOGIZE TO HER, NOW!"<p>"No."<p>Silence as Souun stared wide-eyed at his eldest, then his face<br/>twisted into a mask of cold fury. "Kasumi, you will apologize<br/>to Nodoka this instant!" he hissed, holding up a shaking finger.<p>"No."<p>"Kasumi, APOLOGIZE!"<p>"No."<p>Souun shuddered as the beginnings of a Demon Head aura began<br/>to billow around his shoulders. "Kasumi, APOLOGIZE NOW OR ELSE!"<p>"Or else what?"<p>"YOU WILL NO LONGER BE MY DAUGHTER!"<p>Kasumi blinked, then sighed, rising. "Fine, then. I stopped<br/>considering this place home when you listened to THIS over-honoured<br/>bitch..." she tilted her chin towards the stunned Nodoka, "...and<br/>threw Ranma out of this house," she turned to leave. "Gentlemen?"<p>"Hai!" both "policemen" nodded.<p>Aoki's pistol snapped up, the hammer dropping once. The<br/>*swish-clack!* of a subsonic bullet being fired through a<br/>silencer-modified barrel was followed instantaneously by the wet<br/>noise of flesh and bone shattering as the bullet punched through<br/>the middle of Souun's head. As the Tendou patriarch was flung back<br/>to collapse on the floor, Hojou's weapon locked on Genma. Another<br/>shot mangled the side of his head, making him drop straight down as<br/>his legs knocked over the table. Before Nodoka could try to react,<br/>even if it was just to scream out on seeing her husband and his best<br/>friend murdered before her very eyes, Aoki spun on her, sending<br/>a third bullet to punch through her trachea, oesophagus and spinal<br/>column all at once.<p>She dropped to the floor, the pain overwhelming her as the two<br/>shooters got to their feet. "Before you die, Nodoka, ask yourself<br/>this," Kasumi's voice rang loud and clear in her ears. "Did you<br/>really believe that Ranma-chan would ever forget what you did to<br/>her?"<p>Nodoka shuddered as she tried to cry out, just as Hojou walked<br/>up, calmly aiming his pistol at her forehead.<p>"Much less forgive...?"<p>"Mrs. Ono?"<p>Kasumi blinks, then stares at the driver before noticing that<br/>he had stopped the vehicle by the corner of the old Tendou property.<br/>Taking a deep breath, she nods, giving him a thankful smile. "Home,<br/>please."<p>"Yes, ma'am."<p>The limousine heads off. Kasumi sighs as the familiar sights<br/>pass by her, then sits back in her chair, closing her eyes.<p>There had been simply no choice in the matter, she knew. Ranma<br/>had been made to give up the one thing that matted the most of all to<br/>him - his manhood - when he fought Happousai that last time. But<br/>in putting the evil lech out of his misery once and for all, Ranma<br/>had saved them all from fates far worse than death. And what did<br/>Souun, Genma and Nodoka do in return? Threw the suffering<br/>boy-turned-girl onto the streets, stripping her of her family name<br/>and martial arts legacy, all because of...?<p>What?<p>That rancid, old seppuku contract?<p>Maybe.<p>Some perverse loyalty to Happousai?<p>Less likely, but possible.<p>Perhaps...<p>Fear of what Ranma might've done to them?<p>Kasumi grimaces. If it was that, then...<p>Did Kikuko believe that?<p>Possibly.<p>Well, it no longer mattered now. Even more, the deaths of her<br/>father and Ranma's parents had been rated as accidental thanks to an<br/>intense fire that burned the old home to its foundations (set after<br/>the bullets fired by the two Yakuza hitmen pretending to be policemen<br/>had been extracted) and conveniently melted their bodies to the point<br/>where only dental records could identify them. And with the two<br/>shooters now out of the way thanks to Kikuko and Kasumi herself<br/>resolving to remain silent about this...<p>Yes, it no longer mattered.<p>*** Fin ***<p>* * *<p>"You Reap What You Sow"<br/>a Ranma 1/2 shortfic<br/>by Fred Herriot<p>**** **** ****<br/>C&amp;C by Robert Geiger, Steven Cornett, Jeremy Fogelman and Andrew Norris<p>"Ranma 1/2" created by Rumiko Takahashi. You know the rest of it.<p>Why did I write this?<p>Well, one of the many recurring themes in "Ranma" fanfiction<br/>I've noted to date is the "abandonment" idea. This is where, for<br/>whatever reason, Ranma is virtually abandoned by his family and/or<br/>friends because of some slight or another (frozen as a girl, found<br/>out to be descent of burakumin, etc).<p>The natural outcome of this storyline application is that Ranma is<br/>forced to emotionally and spiritually break away from his upbringing,<br/>then carve a new (often better) life for himself, either with someone<br/>who stayed loyal to him (say Akane or Kasumi) or with someone totally<br/>new.<p>Much that I understand this approach to writing a Ranma fanfic (and<br/>yes, this can be applied to certain "Sailor Moon" fics I've seen),<br/>I just don't like the idea of those who abandon Ranma getting away<br/>with destroying his life. Yes, there are stories which show Ranma<br/>turning around and getting some measure of revenge/justice<br/>on those who turned their collective backs on him, but they are few<br/>and far between in my eyes.<p>After seeing the latest attempt in using this plot idea on<br/>(a Ranma/Sailor Moon X-over called "Sunshine,"<br/>by azn_otaku), my muse got to work and this came out of it. Take it<br/>as you will.<p>Cheers!<p>Fred<p>P.S. One of my reviewers suggested I expand this into a larger fic.<br/>I've no real interest in doing this, but if people ARE interested<br/>in expanding this idea, please feel free to do so (with proper<br/>credits, of course!).
