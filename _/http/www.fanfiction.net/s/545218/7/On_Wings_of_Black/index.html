</div>Demons came today<p>The hid in my teacher<p>They hid in friends<p>When they came out<p>Blood sprayed me<p>Then a demon came out of me<p>Ranma shuddered; she had awoken this morning to find Shampoo almost naked in her futon with her. Then afterwards Nabiki had splashed her and then Shampoo had run after her still clad in barely anything chasing her with a huge Chinese sword.<p>After grabbing the kettle on top of the stove that was kept warm at all times now for the Saotome's he poured it on himself.<p>Startled he heard a clatter behind him and turned around.<p>"Ranma girl-type turn to Ranma boy-type?" Ranma nodded, he wasn't sure how Shampoo was going to take this.<p>"Shampoo kill!"<p>Ranma closed his eyes and waited.<p>He no where to go, Shampoo blocked the only exit.<p>Surprised that he wasn't dead he re-opened his eyes. Shampoo had tears in eyes.<p>"Bye Liao." She turned and ran out of the house.<p>Ranma blinked. "She took that better then I thought."<p>Three largish cats sat looking at the Tendo Dojo.<p>Out of the darkness two others joined them.<p>They arranged themselves into a circle and the bone white cat nodded its head.<p>~ It is time for the test. ~<p>~ The enemies will arrive tomorrow. ~<p>~ Where are the other ones? ~<p>~ They will show before the test. ~<p>~ Will the Host be able to access the two Fragments already within it? ~<p>~ No, the first fragment that bonded to the Host was Fear. ~<p>~ We shall learn if the Host is strong enough, then we will be one once more soon. ~<p>~ It might take as much as a year for the Host to grow powerful enough. This test is to determine if he can. ~<p>~ Or she. ~<p>There was a quiet chuckle.<p>~ What of the Hunter? ~<p>~ She will not interfere unless we harm the boy. ~<p>~ Good thing the Demon race has provided the tools for the test. ~<p>As one the cats stood and disappeared into the shadows.<p>Ryoga closed his eyes in frustration; he hadn't been able to find the Tendo Dojo since that night when Ranma had chased him.<p>He had to warn the people Ranma was living with; otherwise they could be in great danger.<p>He also had to find out a way for him to get stronger or to weaken Saotome some how.<p>It was then when he saw him, Ranma's father.<p>Ryoga called out. "Saotome-San!"<p>"Yes, may I help you?" The older man turned around, he had just spent another day working at Tofu's.<p>"May I speak to you?"<p>"Sure, follow me." They both walked towards the Tendo Dojo.<p>As they sat down at the table Ryoga asked. "Is they're anyone else here?"<p>"Yes the Tendo's"<p>"Could you call them? This concerns them also."<p>"Of course."<p>"Tendo, Kasumi, Nabiki may I talk with you in the dining room?"<p>Various calls of acknowledgement came throughout the house.<p>"Well if it isn't the lost boy."<p>Ryoga flushed. The Tendo's sat down.<p>"I have something important to tell you about Ranma."<p>"Is that so. Do tell."<p>"I suppose I should tell you my history with Saotome Ranma. While in junior high I competed with Ranma for the final bread at lunchtimes. The jerk always got it before me so I decided I had enough and I challenged him to a final duel. When I arrived four days late Ranma was gone and I followed him, cursing his name. That's when I received my curse. A small redhead was chasing a panda and while I looked down at Jusenkyou they knocked me into the Heitoniichuan, or spring of drowned piglet. After surviving the guide and panda almost eating me I followed Ranma back to Japan. After first challenging him at school twice and then at his home I discovered something horrible. Ranma conversing with a demon. He called it Akane, they were working together to deceive everyone around them to think that they were enemies by doing mock fights. I saw Ranma throw something at Akane and it hit her hand completely destroying it, the hand regenerated in seconds! They laughed about it!"<p>Genma turned white, Nabiki arched an eyebrow and Kasumi muttered a quiet 'Oh My'.<p>"So what you are saying is Ranma is in cahoots with Akane?" Nabiki said dubiously, she could see Akane having some minions but Ranma?<p>Ryoga nodded then spoke again. "I ask you not to reveal your knowledge, if you do you could all be in serious danger."<p>"What are you going to do Ryoga?" Soun asked.<p>"Train enough till I'm strong enough to kill them both, I'll probably have to fight them both at the same time."<p>Genma and Soun nodded. "I will train you Ryoga. That is if you told me the truth" Genma said seriously, this was beyond bad. Ranma knew the forbidden techniques of both their schools and had mastered them to a level Soun and Genma had not.<p>Soun spoke up as well his eyes cold, the Demon had once again stolen his chance of happiness, of seeing the schools united. "I shall train you as well."<p>"I should tell you I have difficulty with directions and I get lost easily." This evil had to be destroyed, he had to be patient and not let his anger at Ranma overcome him, and he was no where near powerful enough to challenge either the Demon or Ranma.<p>Ranma was shook out of his sleep as his danger sense went off. Seconds after he heard the screams, they seemed to echo throughout the building.<p>Just as he was getting out of his seat. The wall behind the teacher exploded, a fragment hitting the teacher in the back of the head causing her slump against her desk.<p>The dust cleared and there it stood, seven feet of purple muscle with a long whip-like tail it glanced around the classroom and strode forwards backhanding the desk and teacher away and into the wall.<p>Ranma stared in horror the teacher didn't have a chance, the blow had probably shattered every bone in her body.<p>Ranma stood there gaping in shock before the demon's next actions set him into action. Just as the demon rose it's arm again after slaughtering two stunned students Ranma called out his deadly attack.<p>"Saidaikyuukijinraishuudan." Twice the size of the kijinraishuudan it was also twice as fast. Before the demon could kill a third student the vacuum blade severed its arm then tore through its chest.<p>Ranma released his aura and spread out his senses.<p>There were fifteen demons in the building, he then shuddered as he felt two of them, and they were very powerful.<p>Ranma hopped out of the building, hoping that he could get their attention before they killed everyone.<p>"DEMONS MY NAME IS SAOTOME RANMA AND I CHALLENGE YOU!" He bellowed putting some of his chi into his voice, windows shattered from the sheer noise of it.<p>~ Our prey comes out in the open, how nice of it. ~ One of the demons laughed. Holes began to appear in the building's walls as the demons emerged.<p>-I hope Akane gets here quickly. -<p>And with that the battle was joined. Ranma went at his fastest speed.<p>"Dokujatankesshou!" Ranma slaughtered one demon. He then disappeared from sight, activating the Umi-Sen-Ken.<p>Appearing between the demons he called out "NOVA!"<p>His released chi incinerated three of the weaker demons and left two others stunned and burned.<p>Two quick calls of 'Plasma Flare' destroyed the two stunned demons he quickly disappeared again only to be caught by surprise when one of the demons struck him with a fist when he reappeared.<p>Gasping aloud he felt his side. That single blow had cracked some of his ribs.<p>He would have to be extra careful.<p>He also couldn't use the new Nova attack because of how draining it was. Narrowing his eyes he began to channel his chi through his limbs he disappeared from sight again and the demon was struck from behind with unseen blows.<p>Ranma then appeared in the same spot and struck out with a loud shout. "Moukokaimonha!" Which ripped the demon a hole through its back.<p>Ranma panted, he had only destroyed eight demons and there were eight to go.<p>The rest of demons were weary now; they had lost one leader. Seeing their hesitation Ranma called on the Tendo-Saotome forbidden combination techniques to make a weapon, he needed something to stay out of range. A naginata would do nicely.<p>The weapon flickered into being, its vacuum blade hissing in the air. The long wooden pole with two-foot blade on it stood in his hands. Ranma dropped to a ready stance and beckoned with his free hand.<p>Seeing the demons still hesitate he began to spin the pole-arm in his hands. The vacuum blade cut through the ground and air with equal ease leaving a long trench where it had passed through the hard cement.<p>Without fanfare his mind still slightly in shock from the bloodshed he charged at the demons, leaping over their slightly panicked black chi attacks.<p>One demon had its legs sheared out from under him, another had half it's face caved in from the blunt metal end of the naginata.<p>Finishing off the crippled demon, his blade then ripped through first the ground and then into a low, bulky demon that was approaching him from the other side, cutting it roughly in two.<p>The remaining four demons stared at Ranma, they all together had only hit him once, and it had taken a Demi-Lord to do it. Ranma was covered in different covered liquids that had sprayed from the fallen demon bodies.<p>Ranma also was favoring his left side but it wasn't hampering his combat ability much.<p>Ranma held the naginata's lightly lowered blade first towards the ground waiting for the demons to make the next move.<p>Ranma blurred once again as he took out another demon by tearing off it's head with a knife edged hand, then turned to the next one, gave it a grim smile as he slashed with the blade diagonally across its chest.<p>~ Looks like this boy is much tougher then the Lord of the Council predicted. You go I'll stay and fight. ~<p>The other demon nodded and quickly ran off. Ranma stared after him and snarled. Raising his blade and pointing at the fleeing demon he whispered 'kijinraishuudan' and watched as the vacuum blade flew from the wooden staff he held in his hands and pierced the chest of the demon who gave off a shriek. A few seconds later the blade on the naginata regenerated itself.<p>Ranma gave the last demon a look promising death.<p>~ Looks like the Lord won't know what happened here besides we died. Oh well ~ The demon muttered to itself.<p>The demon blurred into speed and began to strike out at the boy. Seconds later and he fell back and grinned, the boy right arm was now dangling. The boy glanced at his arm distastefully and the Demon watched in astonishment as the pole-arm in his arms shortened and changed to a long sword. Maybe the mission would be successful after all.<p>Ranma was interrupted from his battle when a voice floated over the school grounds.<p>"Little Demon, so you want to _play? _"<p>The demon shuddered, it was HER!<p>"You hurt people in MY home… You hurt Ranma…!" Her voice descended to a growl.<p>"What is this Council?" Akane landed with a soft thump, three meters in front of the demon, between Ranma and the demon.<p>The demon shivered and remained silent. He watched Akane stride towards him and grip him by the throat, the demon couldn't move; the fear was so complete.<p>She wasn't supposed to be here!<p>She was supposed to be out of the ward checking on her stash on things!<p>How had she known they were attacking?<p>~ Little Demon Answer Me, or I'll Make Your Demise Very, Very Painful ~ The demon shook its head.<p>Then the demon began to scream as its life energies were drained.<p>After a few torturous seconds the pain stopped. ~ Well? ~ When no answer was forthcoming Akane became impatient and drained the demon dry. The Demon's shell disintegrated and Akane observed the other Demon's essences as they began to gather the energy needed to rebuild their bodies, straining themselves so they could get away from her.<p>Her enhanced hearing could pick out the gibbering of demons as she looked around.<p>""Ranma you all right?<p>He grimaced as he re-absorbed the sword. "Just a few cracked ribs and a broken arm."<p>"Let me deal with these and I'll carry you over to Tofu's."<p>"Huh?"<p>"Oh, remember what I said about demons bodies?"<p>At his shake of the head she continued.<p>"Demon's don't really have a physical body, though they need one to interact with humans so they form one of their own with their power, the more powerful a demon, the more powerful its body. All their bodies are mortal, for they need certain organs to keep their bodies running so they can be struck dead if hit with enough force in the right vital spot. Once their bodies are destroyed you have to destroy their essences otherwise the demons will merely build a new body."<p>"Oh." Ranma looked dubious. Akane smirked and with one giant heave of her ability to eat demons chi she drained the entire school of demon essence. Without the bodies to protect themselves they had no defense against her.<p>"You did well Ranma, you managed to kill nine Warriors, four Knights and a Demi-Lord."<p>Ranma scowled bitterly. "If I had woken up earlier people wouldn't have died."<p>"Ranma you couldn't have helped it, some people would have died no matter what while they were looking for you."<p>"Looking for me?"<p>"I'm afraid so, they called you prey, that meant you were targeted."<p>Ranma's eyes widened. "Will they come again?"<p>"Probably."<p>"Oh man that is NOT good."<p>With that Akane swept Ranma into her arms and slowly, as not to jostle him too much, she carried him out of the gate walking.<p>Nabiki frowned as she stepped out from behind a tree, Hibiki had told the truth, they treated each other as friends, Ranma had actually gave Akane a smile when he talked to her. What was worse Ranma had easily beaten fifteen demons in combat and only received a few broken bones through ill luck.<p>From Genma's tales she knew that would only hold him up for a few days.<p>Though that wasn't what horrified her.<p>Akane has said that there most likely would be more attacks. Too many students had died today and what had happened here could happen at the Dojo.<p>It was time for Saotome Ranma to move out of the Tendo house.<p>She turned around and grimly listened to her lieutenant's reports.<p>Three dozen dead, three of them teachers, several hundred thousand yen worth of damage.<p>She nodded. Yes it was definitely time for him to move out. It wouldn't hurt that the engagement would be called off.<p>Ryoga and Genma sat near the koi pond after listening to what Nabiki had said.<p>First she had confirmed what Ryoga had said and told them just how deadly Ranma was.<p>Then she had told them of her asking Ranma to stay away from the Dojo in case he endangered Kasumi of her father.<p>Ryoga grinned at that, Nabiki was a shrewd one, and she had gotten Ranma away from the Dojo without raising suspicions.<p>"Saotome-san is there any other weaknesses or abnormal abilities that Ranma possesses?"<p>The slightly overweight man nodded his head once. "He has one weakness, it is his extreme fear of cats, just don't let him be near a cat for too long."<p>"Cats? Why?"<p>"I trained Ranma in the Neko-Ken when he was around six years old. You take the trainee and wrap him fish-sausage then toss him in a pit of starving cats. He didn't learn it right away and he developed the fear of cats, I tried everything to remove the fear. I tried sardines, fish cakes. And other various meats."<p>"Did he learn it?"<p>"Yes, it probably is as powerful as the Yama-Sen-Ken, not only that but it boosts his speed and power and he just doesn't tire. Just don't keep a cat near him for too long."<p>Ryoga shuddered and nodded at the advice.<p>Sorry for such a short chapter, Ranma has passed the test; next Cologne will arrive and join forces with Ryoga, Genma, and Soun in training to defeat the Demoness Akane and her human friend.
