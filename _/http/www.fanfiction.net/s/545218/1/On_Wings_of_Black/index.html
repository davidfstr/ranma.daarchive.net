</div>I do not own any character's in Ranma ½ by Rumiko Takahashi.<p>The Endless Night<p>No Light to Guide Me<p>No Moon to Cheer Me<p>No Warmth Comfort Me<p>A Starless Void<p>A fourteen year old Tendo Akane stopped short of her home's gate, panting.<p>She had expanded her training routine to deal with the annoying Kuno boy from high school. She knew the only reason she had been winning lately was because he was holding back on her.<p>She was Tendo Akane of the Tendo School of Anything Goes Martial Arts, she would not be humiliated like this for long!<p>She had practically quit most of her after-school activities to train and even managed to bludgeon her father into resuming training with her.<p>This was her final run of the day, it was time to go to sleep and see if she had improved any.<p>It was morning and she knocked on her sister's door. Today it was her turn to get up Nabiki; her sister definitely wasn't a morning person.<p>Secretly Akane was grateful for her sisters; they had kept the Dojo and house running despite that their father hadn't worked since mother had died.<p>Suddenly Akane had an idea; maybe she could get her father interested in teaching again!<p>It would help out with the house and she could be a true heir of the Anything Goes School instead of a largely self-trained person.<p>"Nabiki time to get up!" She yelled through the door and then smiled at her sister's mumbles.<p>"Come on sis, breakfast will be ready in twenty minutes. Well I'm heading out for my morning jog."<p>Hearing her sister's reply she ran out of the house going as fast and as hard as she could.<p>As she once again neared her house she suddenly collapsed feeling twin sharp intense pains in her back. After a few minutes of writhing in agony on the ground the pain stopped as soon as it had appeared.<p>After lying on the ground for a few minutes panting at the remembered pain she stood up slowly.<p>"What was THAT?" After a few moments she shrugged she as stepped in the yard.<p>"Tadaima!"<p>"Hello Akane, breakfast is ready."<p>After arriving home from school after decking an annoying boy she went to where her father was sitting.<p>"Daddy, time for us to train again."<p>The older man stood and said cheerfully. "Of course sweetheart."<p>While her father showed her another kata she felt out her idea.<p>"Daddy how do like teaching me?" She knew that this conversation would leave to a bout of tears yet this was the only way, maybe it would only take a month to get him to seriously consider teaching other students.<p>"I feel fine about it daughter." The man said as he corrected her posture.<p>"Would you consider teaching students in the Dojo again?" At her father's almost stricken expression she continued hastily before his tears could start.<p>"I mean it would give me a chance to spar against someone other then myself." Her father immediately began to sob. The only words she could make out over her father's wail was<p>"Reminds… Wife… I miss her so much."<p>She smiled to herself as she continued to practice her kata, after this she would work on her bricks, she could smash through over twenty of them at a time now!<p>Hmmm… maybe one of the reasons Kuno was better then her was that he was faster.<p>She wondered what kind of speed training she could do.<p>It was then when she felt her entire back erupt into pain and everything faded into blackness.<p>She blinked twice and looked around.<p>She was in the neighborhood clinic. She heard the cute doctor, Tofu Ono talking to someone through the door.<p>"Sorry Tendo-San I have no idea why she screamed and collapsed, there is nothing physically wrong with her, though I will talk to her when she wakes."<p>"WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH My baby is going to die!" She could hear the desperation in the young doctor's voice as he tried to calm her hyper- emotional father down.<p>"She will be fine Tendo-San."<p>"WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH My baby is going to be alright!" Akane slowly shook her head at her father's antics, how would she ever get him to teach a successful class in the Dojo if he broke down like this all the time.<p>"Doctor Tofu, Daddy, I'm up!" Akane called out.<p>The door opened with Dr. Tofu and her father entering the small room.<p>"How do you feel Akane?" That was the doctor, her father was still wailing about her apparent sickness.<p>"Fine Doctor Tofu." She answered shyly, she knew it was silly to have a crush on someone ten years her senior but the young man had always been there to heal her.<p>"Well why do you think you screamed out and collapsed this afternoon." The doctor asked cautiously.<p>"I don't know one moment I was going through a kata, then my back felt like it was on fire." The doctor looked curious.<p>"Could I take a look at your back Akane?" She nodded and took off her shirt lying back down on the examining table.<p>"Where exactly on your back?"<p>"Around my shoulder blades I think."<p>She felt the doctor's hands probing her back and then stopped. "There is nothing wrong as far as I can tell Akane, Tendo-San."<p>Slipping her shirt back on she spoke. "Thank you Doctor Tofu."<p>"No problem Akane, if you feel anything else don't hesitate to call." The doctor called to the two as they walked out of the clinic.<p>"Father I told you I'm alright, I want to learn some more kata's. I've mastered the ones you showed me already." Akane was standing in front of her father seething. It had been nearly a week since the two incidents and her father wouldn't train her anymore.<p>"Not until I'm certain you are alright dear."<p>She had had to settle for training by herself for the last week, working, pushing her body to new limits.<p>Since she had no real idea how to get better speed she had to try and come up with new ways.<p>Now she was just frustrated at her father's reluctance to teach her or anyone else.<p>Stupid pain if it hadn't happened her father might have started classes again.<p>She began to think of different ways to convince her father to teach her again, if her obvious results in her training didn't satisfy her father what would?<p>Maybe she could think better after a nice long soak.<p>Muttering under her breath about father's and their annoying over- protectiveness she stomped up the stairs.<p>Reaching the furo she undressed and began to vigorously scrub herself with soap.<p>While washing her thoughts turned back to the strange pains in her back she had felt a week ago.<p>She had forgot to mention the first time she had to the doctor, but since it hadn't happened again she had decided it wasn't that important.<p>After rinsing herself off she stepped into the furo.<p>Letting the hot water relax her sore muscles she considered the problem of her father. Forty minutes passed and still no knew ideas came to her when her thoughts were interrupted by Kasumi's sweet voice.<p>"Akane dinner is almost ready."<p>"Be right out Kasumi!" She immediately started to get out of the furo and began to rub herself down with the large towel.<p>Putting the towel down she grabbed a clean pair of panties and pants and slipped them on.<p>She picked up a bra and began to hunt for a clean shirt when she whimpered.<p>Dropping the bra as the pain in her back continued to get worse she whimpered louder.<p>Falling down, she arched her back further in agony against the cool tiles and then began to scream.<p>The pain increased, as did the strength of her scream. She was vaguely aware of the people around her asking what was wrong. It wasn't until the pain had grown to intolerable levels and then fade did the world disappear to her relief and sudden cessation of the pain.<p>Once again she awoke to voices.<p>"I'm sorry Tendo-San there is nothing physically wrong with your daughter, in fact all our tests show that she is in the best of health."<p>She looked around; she vaguely recognized the room as one of those in Nerima General hospital from the time she had visited Sayura three years ago.<p>The pain in her back was still there but it was tolerable. The doctor and her father turned at her whimper.<p>"It hurts." She managed to gasp out.<p>"Where?" The doctor was immediately by her side.<p>"My back." She then whimpered as a new wave of pain overcame her.<p>Studying her bare back the doctor gave a confused shrug, as far as he could tell the girl was fine, but he also could tell she was in considerable pain.<p>"Can you walk Akane?"<p>"Yes, just give me a second." After breathing in and out she stood; noticing that what she did didn't increase or decrease the pain she stretched.<p>"How is it Akane?" The doctor was impressed by her mobility.<p>"I can move around but it still hurts. Do you think I can go home? I want to continue my training!"<p>The man chuckled at that. "You might as well young lady, I can't tell why you hurt, maybe when we get some of the tests back. I'll call you ok?"<p>"Sure, thanks Doctor."<p>The entire conversation was carried over Akane's fathers blubbering.<p>The two men walked out of the room to give Akane some privacy to dress.<p>After pulling on her clothes, wincing every-time the pain got stronger, then receded she left the room and took her father by the hand.<p>"Come on daddy, let's go home."<p>"How is the pain Akane?" Doctor Tofu asked, it was her twice-weekly checkups after the third attack. Three weeks had passed with the constant waves of pain lessening.<p>"Nearly gone doctor, daddy doesn't believe me and won't let me go to school." The doctor chuckled at that.<p>"Still practicing the Art Akane?"<p>"Yes, but daddy won't teach me anything new, says he's worried enough as it is."<p>The doctor moved to his chart and began writing. "Oh is that so, I might be willing to teach you a move or two."<p>Akane brightened and then smiled at the doctor. "Really? You mean it?"<p>"Yes, come on by tomorrow and I'll begin immediately."<p>"Thank you Doctor Tofu!" Akane hopped off of the examining table and began to whistle as she headed for the door.<p>Suddenly she stopped and gasped aloud her eyes widening in pain.<p>"Akane? What's the matter?" She gave no reply as she whimpered and crumpled to the floor. Waves of pain growing steadily robbed her of her breath.<p>Doctor Tofu watched her carefully studying her aura and trying to figure out what was wrong.<p>He gasped out loud as her entire aura pulsed blue-black. The color fading to leave all but the shoulder blade area clears of the color until the next pulse.<p>Akane's scream was cut off as she went unconscious. Doctor Tofu noted that the blue-black markings on her aura had faded completely away except for two tiny dots near her shoulder blades.<p>"What happened?" Akane spoke groggily to Doctor Tofu who was sitting in front of her.<p>"You had another attack Akane, and I think I might have a small clue on what is happening to you." Akane perked up at that despite the waves of pain she was still feeling.<p>"Really what?"<p>"When you collapsed I noticed your aura suddenly flash a very unusual color. A blue-black color to be precise, I have already began to contact my colleagues to help me on your case."<p>"Thanks doctor, umm how long was I out?"<p>"Only ten minutes, oh and your free to go Akane."<p>"Thanks doctor." Akane began to walk home slowly grimacing at the pain she felt.<p>Not really paying attention to her surroundings she walked towards her house, which was why when Kuno stepped in front of her she was surprised.<p>"Beauteous Tigress, Fair Tendo Akane, I would date with thee!"<p>"Excuse me upperclassman, not right now I have to get home."<p>"Nay Fair one, I shall defeat thee in combat and then date with thee!" Kuno held his bokken up and got in to a ready stance.<p>"I said not now." The pain she felt combined with her temper made her snap far earlier then usual when confronting the strange young man.<p>She backhanded the bokken in front of her as hard as she could and began to move under Kuno's guard.<p>Kuno didn't notice the enraged approach of Akane, as he was staring at his broken bokken, half of it had snapped cleanly off hard enough to puncture the stone wall beside the two teens.<p>Then Akane punched him once, hard.<p>The upperclassman was thrown back and landed in a heap twenty meters away.<p>Akane sniffed once and turned the corner towards her house.<p>Akane shifted unconformable by the table as she picked at her dinner.<p>"Something wrong Akane?" Nabiki asked.<p>"No." Akane spoke.<p>"You sure?" Nabiki was fairly certain her little sister was in a great deal of pain.<p>"Well, I did have another attack today, and the pain is getting worse not better." Akane was beginning to gasp.<p>"Should I call doctor Tofu?" That was Kasumi.<p>"That might be a good idea Kasumi." This time the words came out in a pained wheeze.<p>"Oh My!"<p>Their father was staring at Akane with horror as she stared at the table hunched over with unseeing eyes her breath coming in short desperate gasps for air.<p>Just as Kasumi reached the phone Akane arched her entire body, abruptly standing up.<p>Her head thrown back and her entire body quivering in pain she began to scream.<p>The pitch and strength of the scream caused the entire family to clasp their ears; it was probably heard by the entire district.<p>The pain grew and unnoticed by everyone the back of Akane's shirt began to bulge, as if something was pressing against it.<p>The tearing sound of Akane's shirt went unnoticed as it blended into the scream as the two things protruding from her back destroyed her shirt.<p>Her scream ending the Tendo's stared at the youngest daughter.<p>"Akane?" That was Nabiki.<p>As the young girl raised her blurry eyes at the girl; with as gasp Nabiki stepped back.<p>Glowing gold eyes stared at her over an open mouth where two impossible long canines hung from her upper jaw.<p>Her long blue-black hair now seemed to glow with unnatural vitality.<p>Her entire figure had matured to look like she eighteen instead of her natural age of fourteen.<p>But it wasn't that that scared the entire Tendo family.<p>It was the two large blue-black wings sprouted from her back.<p>"She looks like a demon." Nabiki whispered in a terrified tone.<p>His daughter's words coupled with a remembered story and picture from an ancient scroll caused the Tendo patriarch to snap.<p>"You killed Kumiko!" The man shouted.<p>"You pretended to be our daughter! You stole my wife's life!" Tendo Soun grabbed a large katana off of the wall and swung at the girl.<p>Confused by the absence of pain and strange sensations emitting from her back Akane gave out a startled scream and ran half-naked with Soun chasing her.<p>"Come back here and die demon!"<p>Well what did you think of it so far?
