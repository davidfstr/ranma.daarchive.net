</div>O baba<p>Old Wise One<p>Elder of Ancient Tribe<p>Teach me<p>Let me Learn from your Wisdom<p>I beg of thee<p>O Baba<p>Chapter 7 – O Baba - the Honored Hag<p>For the past week Akane had watched Ranma through the small window where Dr. Tofu had let the pig-tailed martial artist sleep.<p>While awake the Doctor would show the young man various pressure points on the human body to keep him occupied from his broken ribs that were healing abnormally slowly.<p>Every night Ranma would thrash around as much as his broken arm would allow him as nightmares invaded his sleep, Akane heard him begging his father and pleading for his mother about the cats. She felt a bottomless rage at Genma and it took all her will power too not to go and kill him.<p>Every night a Shadow would wait until he calmed down. In a form of a Cat the Shadow would wait then dissolve into blackness and enter Ranma through his eyes, ears and nose.<p>On the eleventh day just as Ranma's nightmares ended Akane spoke to the waiting Shadow. ~ Little Shadow what will happen when you enter? ~<p>~ The Host will become slightly stronger, faster, more agile and have better reflexes. We will wait until the Host has enough power to re-forge us, and then it will be up to him to what happens after. It will take a bit more then a year, maybe less, for him to become strong enough. ~<p>~ Very well little Shadow I shall speak to you again. ~<p>To her vision Ranma's aura obtained a thirteenth small speak of black on it. Jusenkyou and the fading energies of the demon amulet flickered across his aura. Immediately Ranma's quietly glowing gold aura flashed black, blacker then the night around him.<p>As the aura faded slightly Akane saw Ranma's form had drastically changed, he now had thick sleek black fur, his body had about doubled in size. His hands and feet sported large thick claws tinted with red, as if splotched with blood.<p>She nearly flinched with surprise at the sight of the tail as Ranma turned over in his sleep.<p>Abruptly as it appeared the black aura dissipated and Ranma shrunk into his normal form.<p>Her eyes wide she whispered one thing. "Nezumi." Were-creature! The Shadows had turned her friend into a were-cat!<p>She was powerless now to remove them, if she tried Ranma would die!<p>Her eyes narrowed, she would have to help her friend control his newest curse. From the whispers she listened to from the nearby witches covens she knew were-creatures often had trouble controlling themselves.<p>It looked like if Ranma went into the neko-ken he would not only change mentally now but physically. This was bad.<p>The crone watched with beaded eyes, a Hunter here!<p>There hadn't been a Hunter even before Joketsuzoku had been founded. Not only that but her new muko-dono had all thirteen Fragments of the horrible Neko-Ken.<p>Her great-granddaughter was right he was a strong one, pity about her curse, with a cat form she couldn't approach her husband without having to be weary about water.<p>What to do about the Hunter? In order for her great-granddaughter to win him over she would have to compete with a creature out of legends and a very, very powerful one at that.<p>She nodded to herself, somehow she would have to deal with the Hunter, she would do it herself if necessary but maybe there would be some willing tools. The legends had spoke of the fear and hatred that surrounded the Hunter's, even Cologne had felt it, though she ignored it as much as possible, the Hunter would have made some very powerful enemies in this district, besides muko-dono's she felt several powerful aura's in the area.<p>Maybe she could convince muko-dono using other methods. The Jusenkyou curse would possible provide proper motivation.<p>Yes, the full body cats-tongue would do nicely. Perhaps she could train him too, she could tell he was extremely proficient in the Art and it was always a joy to teach the younger generation.<p>If it failed she would have to train others to subdue him. Maybe if there was any suitable she could draw another strong young male into the tribe.<p>"I turn into a c-c-cat?" Ranma was staring at Akane, his arm still hurt but it wasn't as bad. The news of what happened last night was shocking. Ranma turned into his worst nightmare.<p>Akane nodded sadly, this was bad for Ranma, and he would be completely shunned if he lost control of his form when someone was watching. "I'll help you Ranma, I've heard of people being able to control when they transform."<p>"Thanks Akane-chan."<p>"Close your eyes." Ranma did so. "Now picture in your mind a cat in the form of a man."<p>Akane watched as Ranma's form changed once again, though without the black aura. He filled out his Chinese clothes to near bursting point and his entire form seemed to exude a palatable sense of feline grace and power.<p>His face remained largely unchanged, though only slightly feline like it was his eye's that drew her; they had become slit like a cat. The smoky blue-gray color almost seemed to glow.<p>"You can open your eyes now Ranma." He did so and she turned him to look in the mirror at his new form.<p>"You OK?"<p>Ranma nodded jerkily, he looked like a c-c-c-c-c… THING!<p>"Ranma close your eyes again and think about how you look when human."<p>Slowly his form shrunk and became normal.<p>"Good Ranma, now just keep the image of yourself while human firmly in your mind at all times no matter what and you won't change." She said after he had opened his eyes again.<p>Ranma nodded. "What now?"<p>"Well I'm going to look for clues on the Council that the demon talked about."<p>"Ok, I'm getting bored sitting here, I think I'll probably go out for ice cream or somethin."<p>Ranma watched Akane smile then fly off. She really did have a beautiful smile he mused as he hopped down off the roof. Changing into a girl he went towards the ice cream parlor.<p>Walking slowly down the street enjoying the morning air her danger sense suddenly pinged. She dodged the swift strikes.<p>"Well done muko-dono."<p>There was an old wrinkled three-foot woman balancing on a gnarled staff, her eyes glittered with amusement.<p>"Muko-Dono?"<p>"You are to marry my great-granddaughter Shan Pu!" The old woman cackled and hopped on her staff to the nearest roof and out of sight.<p>Ranma scowled and followed the old crone. Keeping an eye on her fleeing form was difficult but he managed to see where she had stopped.<p>When Ranma managed to get behind her she cackled again.<p>"Well done muko-dono, Shan Pu has chosen wisely! I am Ku Lon, Matriarch of the Amazons."<p>She jabbed forward with her staff so quickly that even with his improved reflexes sparring with Akane couldn't dodge, tapping him lightly on the chest.<p>"Soon muko-dono, soon you will be begging to marry my Shan Pu."<p>"What was that about?" Ranma scratched his head.<p>Akane narrowed her eyes, she hadn't been out of Nerima since Ranma had arrived, things had changed, and most of the demons had disappeared from the various wards of Tokyo. Only a few non-aligned evil entities still haunted the city.<p>-Where have they all gone? - She wondered.<p>It was if something had scared them off. It didn't do much beyond frustrate her plans of finding what the demon had meant by the Council, she had just feasted on the essences of several demons and the demon realm wasn't the only thing that spawned creatures with heavily unbalanced chi. Just the most powerful, and the most plentiful.<p>Her face twisted into a grimace she headed back to Nerima, she thought she had felt something powerful enter her domain a few days ago but it had hidden itself well. It wasn't a demon though, no matter what, no demon could hide from her.<p>Landing on top of the clinic Akane smiled gently as Ranma's aura moved through the building. By his position he was heading towards the furo.<p>She lay back, spreading her wings full out enjoying the midday sun on her body. For five minutes she lay there until a piercing scream rent the sunlit air.<p>-Ranma! -<p>Her blue-black aura snapped into being and she disappeared from sight, only to reappear when she smashed through the window. She saw Ranma there panting, shaking her very red leg, like it had been scalded.<p>"What's the matter Ranma?"<p>Looking up the redhead spoke to the girl. "The water is boiling!"<p>Dipping her hand into the furo she looked up. "Ranma it's only lukewarm."<p>"Do you think lukewarm water would burn me like this?" She said pointing to her reddened leg.<p>Akane narrowed her eyes and splashed Ranma gently, she watched her flinch and amazingly her skin reacted as if scalding hot water had splashed her.<p>Akane's eyes flashed as she changed her vision to examine Ranma's aura, the shimmering gold skin that surrounded the girl seemed to be edged in flames, surrounding her almost evenly except where it grew brighter around her chest.<p>"Ranma, something's effected your chi, you probably can only tolerate cold water. You can't change back without suffering tremendous pain."<p>"What? I can't be a guy again?"<p>"Talk to Dr. Tofu, maybe he will have an idea."<p>Suddenly Ranma's eyes lit up. "The old ghoul!"<p>"What?"<p>"There was this old woman, said she was the great-grandmother of Shan Pu or somethin, she said I would soon be begging her to marry Shan Pu!"<p>"Really?" Akane narrowed her eyes, someone had hurt her Ranma, in the worst place possible, his manhood. It was bad enough for him to have no hope of a cure but not to be able to turn back would be horrible for him.<p>Seeing the look Akane was giving Ranma recognized it, it was the one she often wore when Ranma talked about Genma and Ranma had to convince Akane not to kill him, or when she talked about the demon's who committed atrocities. "Akane I'll deal with her."<p>Reluctantly Akane nodded.<p>Ranma was storming around Nerima looking for the ghoul who had cursed her more then she already was. Suddenly a purple blur blindsided him and something had wrapped him into a hold that disabled his every attempt to get loose. Well he could get loose but it would most likely break the bones of the girl holding him.<p>"Airen happy to see wife?" It was Shan Pu.<p>"Sh-Shampoo, I told ya I'm not your husband!"<p>"Airen hate Shampoo." The girl started to cry softly.<p>Panicking, he really hated to see a girl cry he stuttered out. "Now S- Shampoo I don't hate ya, I do like ya but - URK"<p>Suddenly the affectionate Amazon assaulted him again.<p>"Get Offa me Shampoo." After Ranma had extracted herself from Shan Pu's slackening grasp she asked the one lead she had on Ku Lon.<p>"Hey where is that great-grandmother of yours?"<p>"Great-grandmother? She in restaurant, Neko Hanten best ramen in Nerima!" Shan Pu pointed across the street.<p>Ranma growled, in her current form it was a cute growl and it caused Shan Pu to giggle slightly.<p>"OLD WOMAN WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME!" She bellowed as she opened the door.<p>"Greetings muko-dono, if you want the full-body cats tongue pressure point to be released I'll cure you, you just have to marry Shan Pu." She lightly fingered a purple case that had a string tied around her neck.<p>"Aiya is Eternal Pheonix Pill, can make eater withstand any heat." Shan Pu whispered behind Ranma.<p>"The cure!" Ranma blasted her way across the restaurant surprising the customers with the show as Ku Lon redirected her blurring hands and sent her flying out the open door.<p>Ranma snarled and mentally rolled up her sleeves and went at her full speed this time.<p>Though definitely not as fast as Akane at her best she could easily appear a blur to normal human sight.<p>"Aiya. Airen is so fast!" Shan Pu whispered her trained eyes could barely make out Ranma's individual blows.<p>Though Ranma was fast Ku Lon was faster and once again sent the enraged pigtailed, currently female martial artist flying out the door, this time up side down into the wall and sliding into the trash heaped against it.<p>Something caught the stunned redhead's attention and she excitedly grabbed the piece of paper.<p>'Hiring waitresses, only the best for the best ramen stop in Nerima. Come to the Neko Hanten'<p>Ranma grinned and marched into the restaurant. "Hey old ghoul you still hiring." At her nod Ranma grinned cheekily. "You just hired the best waitress in Nerima!"<p>"Its been three days Ranma, just let me deal with her. You're exhausted and you're getting no closer then the first day."<p>Ranma gave a weary grin "Nah, thanks to her I'm getting a lot faster thanks to her pressing those strange pressure points on my arms, I think its maximizing my chi-flows or something."<p>"Well reasoned muko-dono, I didn't think you would be able to spot that. Greetings honored Hunter."<p>Both jerked in surprise. Akane was alarmed; she hadn't even sensed the Matriarch.<p>A neutral expression upon her face she bowed at the older woman. "Greetings honored elder."<p>"I came here to show you something muko-dono." Quickly setting a fire she scattered a few handful of chestnuts into the fire.<p>"Behold a technique that has been feared by Chinese emperors for three thousand years. Katchyuu Tenshin Amaguriken!" With the shout came a sudden blurring of arms around ten times faster then Akane could reach without activating her aura.<p>Both of them were interested in this, Akane more so because she could see the old woman's aura flow through her arms.<p>"Now you try." She handed the bag of chestnuts to the young man/woman.<p>~ Honored Hunter how do you mind my Shan Pu chasing after Ranma. ~<p>Akane glanced at the old woman and replied in the same language.<p>~ As long as she doesn't try to manipulate his mind through drugs and potions I will allow her pursuit of him, only if Ranma actually falls in love with her will I allow you to take him. ~<p>The matriarch nodded, a piece of knowledge floated to her brain, some ancient texts from before her tribes existence had told of the Hunters extreme territorial and possessive instincts.<p>"If Ranma goes with us will you follow?"<p>Akane jerked as if shot, would she leave Nerima, her home, HER Nerima for Ranma. Yes she would, she would sacrifice Nerima and everyone in it to stay near Ranma.<p>Reluctantly she nodded; she knew she shouldn't value one person's life so highly but she would.<p>The Matriarch's eyes glittered with excitement as she watched Ranma try and fail the technique, if she got Ranma she would not only get a great addition to the tribe she would also get the greatest protector against the Demon realm on Earth, a Hunter of the Hunters!<p>If Shan Pu failed to capture this young ones heart in one year she would adopt the boy, and bring him back as an honored member of the tribe, above all males in status, hell with his female half Ranma could be initiated fully into a tribe as a warrior!<p>Shan Pu though would have an excellent chance, she was affectionate, beautiful, an excellent cook and an extremely warrior. If Ranma's heart hadn't already been captured by the Hunter that is.<p>"Ranma, you need a rest! Your going to hurt yourself at this rate, you've had to go to Dr. Tofu's three times so far for campfire burns!"<p>Ranma stared at her and scowled slightly. "Uh uh, I gotta get my cure. The old ghoul came yesterday and showed me the technique again, I know I'll get it soon."<p>"Ranma, if you don't do something relaxing I'm going to put out every fire you start!"<p>Ranma grumbled a bit. "Fine if I go to that fair will I be relaxed enough for ya?"<p>Akane smiled at him cheerfully. "Good idea Ranma a fair should be great for you."<p>-Wish she would wear something brighter, those black clothes really don't suit her smile, a light sky blue or yellow- Ranma thought as she walked towards the carnival.<p>Akane smiled at the retreating back then turned to the campfire. -My turn! -<p>"Katchyuu Tenshin Amaguriken." She whispered trying to copy the chi flows through her arms like she saw the old woman do. She scowled as she failed.<p>"Again!"<p>"Again!"<p>Her voice faded as Ranma continued to walk.<p>Ranma was enjoying herself immensely as she wandered through the fair, she had tons of things to eat and she had won practically every game she had played. Looking up from her ice cream cone at the sound of someone crying she wandered over.<p>"What's the matter kid?"<p>"I can't get a goldfish." *sniff* The boy pointed to a stall where a man cursed as the tiny paper net broke.<p>Ranma wandered over and watched as the man cursed again. "How much." She asked the vendor.<p>"Two hunnerd and fifty little lady. You keep all the gold fish you catch."<p>Ranma cringed at the lady comment then smirked; this would get the idiot back.<p>"The trick is speed." She said to the little boy who had followed her.<p>Grinning her hands blurred, the thing with the net was that it was paper, and everyone knew how well wet paper held together. Move fast enough and the paper wouldn't stay still long enough to get wet.<p>She smiled at the man's expression as she landed the last goldfish into the glass bowls. She was slightly puzzled by the euphoria on his face until he reached behind him and yanked out a huge tank of needlepoint teethed fish.<p>"The only way you will get to keep all those fish if is you catch all my piranhas with your bare hands!" The man said speaking triumphantly, sure of his ploy would work.<p>Ranma thought for a bit, all she would have to do is move so fast she wouldn't… get… wet.<p>AHA that stupid technique!<p>If she could do it she wouldn't lose her hands!<p>"Alright I'll do it." She kneeled in front of the tank.<p>"KATCHYUU TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN!"<p>Akane was grinning ear from ear. She had mastered the technique!<p>The sheer speed of it was exhilarating, briefly wondering how it would do with her aura she pushed the thoughts of testing her new found speed when a grumpy Ranma passed the roof she had been lounging on.<p>"What the matter Ranma." She asked calling out lazily, the evening air combined with the steady heat of the sun was absolutely wonderful, especially after working out all day.<p>"Huh, oh nothing really just upset at the old ghoul. I finally master the katchyuu tenshin amaguriken and get the pill from her and find out that she's switched the pill with a candy drop!"<p>"Huh, that's too bad what are you going to do?" Akane was a little upset with the Elder, but she had to restrain herself, she wasn't threatening Ranma's life, just making him work for himself.<p>"I'm gonna try and convince the old ghoul to give it to me. But that's for tomorrow."<p>"See ya Ranma, lets spar after you confront her ok?"<p>"Sure, haven't done that since the fight with those demons."<p>With a slightly more upbeat walk Ranma headed towards the clinic and Akane lay back down, with so few demons in Tokyo and none of the non-aligned creatures nearby Akane decided to enjoy the peace while it lasted.<p>Eyes glittered as they watched the young man practice with Genma and Soun, this one was skilled, and the boy would make a worthwhile investment.<p>The name of Anything-Goes made her frown slightly though, Happosai certainly had produced two very capable warriors.<p>Yes, she would train him, but not yet.<p>She disappeared into the shadows.<p>His Shan Pu was somewhere close; he had followed the horrible old hag who had kept them apart for so long.<p>Somewhere in this city, somewhere in this district, was his beautiful and pure Shan Pu. She would be his! She would!<p>No man, no demon, and certainly no Elder was going to stand in his way. No matter how much blood would be spilled, no matter how many lives would be taken.<p>The Master of Hidden Weapons and Master of Dark Magic had arrived in Nerima.<p>They would know fear!<p>Mousse is here!<p>Shan Pu scowled as she watched the greatest evil she had ever seen talk to her airen. Grandmother had warned her away from this one and told her not to interfere otherwise Shan Pu could lose her chances with Ranma and maybe lose her life.<p>Her airen had somehow managed to befriend this Demon, this Akane. Watching him spar with her and joke with her was agony in itself. Because her great- grandmother had warned her about approaching her husband while in cat form she couldn't show him how much worthier she was then this Demon of his attention.<p>Then a stray scent was picked up on the breeze.<p>GODS!<p>Not him, anything but HIM!<p>She had to warn her airen to be wary; Mousse was incredibly powerful and jealous to the extreme.<p>She had lost many male friends because of him.<p>Damn him! He wouldn't take this one away from her, he wouldn't! This was the first time she had felt anything this powerful for anybody or anything.<p>Nabiki had been tailing Ranma for quite a while, cataloging when and where he would meet her ex-sister.<p>The more Nabiki watched the more puzzled she grew, her ex-sister was… nice… almost shy. Nabiki would have thrown it all out as an act until she witnessed her actually letting Shan Pu live after her rather obvious attempts at seducing Ranma. Also Kodachi was left unharmed despite her annoying laugh and her habit of paralyzing Ranma to steal a kiss.<p>Watching their teasing and sparring reminded her of watching her mother and father sometimes, back before she grew really ill.<p>And those few moments of closeness…<p>Were Ranma and the Demoness Akane actually falling in love?<p>That was impossible.<p>She was a Demon for god's sake.<p>She couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong though. Were the last two years of fearing Akane wrong?<p>Was she wrong?<p>…<p>Ryoga panted from exhaustion, he only slept six hours a night and trained non-stop during the day. He could feel the knowledge flowing through him as he absorbed technique after technique of the Anything-Goes School. The Forbidden Techniques were just the tip of the iceberg of an Art developed through two skilled masters. Sure they were the pinnacles of both schools but the foundation was just as important.<p>To top that off some old woman had just trounced both Masters as if they were nothing then offered to train him.<p>Today was the end of a very long and very confusing training regimen. What the hell did chestnuts have to do with anything? What was she talking about with those boulders?
