</div>Blackness surrounds us<p>Screams pierce the dark<p>Mommy... Poppa... gone<p>Light surrounds us<p>The bad things go POOF!<p>Where is mommy?<p>Where is poppa?<p>Ranma stood in a small clearing facing Ryoga, Mousse was waiting by the sidelines and Cologne and Akane were up in the trees watching the spectacle.<p>It had been a tiring week for all parties, Ryoga and Mousse had both managed to master the Bakusai Tenkatsu though Mousse was the only one who had managed to get his speed up to master the Katchyuu Tenshin Amaguriken.<p>Ranma still was slightly sore from the bakusai tenkatsu training, though he hadn't mastered it yet it was still a matter of time, he had been only working on it for two days, while his two opponents had had the entire week.<p>Akane was probably at the same stage as him, though she didn't seem to be bothered at all by being slammed into a boulder twice a day.<p>Ryoga charged the pigtailed boy, surprising him slightly with his speed. Ranma ducked under Ryoga's outstretched finger and used the speed that came naturally to him from sparring with Akane to deflect the flying debris of the bakusai tenkatsu.<p>Ranma redirected the second attack and spun around with a crescent kick slamming Ryoga into a small rocky outcropping.<p>It had felt like he had been hitting concrete.<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed as he watched the lost boy get up. "Heh Ranma that felt like a babies kick." The lost boy smirked.<p>Ranma blinked, and studied the boy as they circled one another. He was faster, and tougher, a lot tougher. Ryoga charged again this time stabbing the ground to confuse Ranma with the shards of rocks.<p>Ranma smirked. "Using a smoke screen Ryoga?"<p>"HAAAAAA!" Ryoga's shout and him emerging from the cloud of dust with his finger outstretched was his only answer.<p>"Bakusai Tenkatsu Block!" Ranma captured the lost boy's finger in between two of his own.<p>Ryoga quickly brought his other finger around and Ranma repeated the block with his other hand.<p>Ryoga head butted Ranma and Ranma snarled. "Fine lets end this!"<p>He retaliated with a hard reverse crescent kick that launched Ryoga into one of the many rocky outcroppings in the area, cracking it and causing it to collapse over the lost boy.<p>"Heh didn't have much did he?"<p>Surprise became evident as Ryoga stood up, tumbling the rocks and small boulders that had landed on him.<p>"I told you Ranma, that felt like a babies kick, you don't have enough strength to hurt me."<p>Ranma grinned at that, he had been holding back, he hadn't even unleashed his battle aura yet.<p>"Maybe Ryoga, but maybe not." Ranma let some of the control over his strength slips, he began glowing ever so slightly.<p>"More tricks Ranma?"<p>"No."<p>Ryoga knew he was outclassed, but he knew that even before the beginning of the challenge, this was too see where he stood against his foe.<p>Suddenly his hands shot out, blurring slightly as they lashed at the ground in front of him, a veritable wall of flying shards engulfed the two fighters. Not harming Ryoga in the slightest, but leaving Ranma bloody with cuts and scrapes all over his body except his face, where he had blocked the flying stones.<p>Ranma ignored the damage as he blurred into the amaguriken, dozens of blows in less then a second rocked the lost boy sending him staggering back, for the first time in the fight feeling some pain.<p>Ryoga lashed out again, this time not trying the bakusai tenkatsu, as he felt Ranma moving inside his reach he desperately kicked out, trying to force his attacker out so he could gain his bearings.<p>Ranma seemed to bend slightly around the attack then lashed out with a second amaguriken, causing Ryoga to fly bent over into the shrubbery.<p>"So muko-dono is using his speed training to good effect, I wonder how long he can last with those injuries?"<p>Akane glanced at the woman beside her. "He's already won hasn't he?"<p>"Not yet child." Cologne pointed with her staff at the staggering figure.<p>"Well Ranma, how long can you last?"<p>Ranma cursed, Ryoga had injured him and he was already feeling slightly faint at the blood loss.<p>"Long enough to defeat you piggy!" Ranma charged the lost boy, leaping into a jump kick, which sent the cursed martial artist flying. Rolling with Ryoga they came to a stop with Ranma readying a final amaguriken, almost a hundred blows rocked Ryoga causing him to black out from the pain.<p>Beneath the two the rock began to crack.<p>Akane started as the two figures began to fall. She then leaped out of the tree and quickly flew over the spot the two had just been, seeing them still falling she folded her wings and blurred to catch the two martial artists.<p>"You ok Ranma?" She asked slightly worriedly, it looked like Ranma had been dragged through a gravel pit.<p>"Fine Akane, just let me catch my breath." The pigtailed martial artist turned and glared at the old woman.<p>"How could you teach Ryoga something like the bakusai tenkatsu?"<p>"Relax muko-dono" The old woman tapped Ranma on the forehead. "It's useless on humans, only works on rocks, was developed by construction workers."<p>Ranma shivered slightly, thinking he was going to explode soon. "I said relax."<p>The old woman then cackled and bounced off. She called over her shoulder as she left "Tell Ryoga to continue to practice the katchyuu tenshin amaguriken."<p>Akane nodded and looked on with worry at her fiancé. He was looking pale.<p>Akane smirked down at the redhead as she trudged down the road towards the clinic, Ranma had recovered quite well after her battle and was in top spirits. They had planned to continue the bakusai tenkatsu training at home and everything was looking up.<p>Those spirits were dashed when it rained for the entire trip home, and now they were nearing the clinic.<p>Suddenly Akane's head shot up.<p>DEMONS!<p>Dozens of them, all throughout Nerima!<p>"Ranma, you got to go to the Dojo, quickly, there are demons there! I'll deal with the rest around Nerima."<p>Ranma paled at the news, demons in Nerima?<p>She nodded and shot off.<p>Ranma stopped shocked as the tore through the dojo gate. All five of the hulking beasts looked up as she entered.<p>Kasumi was lying on the grass near the cherry tree, her face pale and her body was limp. The rise and fall of her chest proved that she was alive to Ranma's relief after one heart stopping moment.<p>Red drowned her vision.<p>They had hurt Kasumi, the gentlest most caring person on Earth, a woman who wouldn't harm a fly.<p>Ranma would drink their blood and make them suffer!<p>Slowly a steady growl began to emerge from her chest as she gave herself into the feeling.<p>The growl grew louder and then with an inaudible snap the neko-ken kicked in.<p>The cat looked around, rage dominating her features.<p>THERE!<p>PREY!<p>The prey would DIE!<p>The demons were shocked at the sudden surge of power, frozen, until the small redhead leapt at the closest demon and tore out its throat with its bare teeth.<p>Snarling Ranma-Neko turned and glared at the other demons, unheeding the liquid running down her face.<p>They looked at one another and nodded. As one being they charged to avenge their brother.<p>The were-cat seemed to melt around their attacks lashing out with invisible claws that tore deep furrows in their skin. One tried to block an attack and watched with astonishment as its arm thumped onto the ground.<p>A few seconds later it watched it's entire body separate into four pieces. Shock was the only expression on its inhuman face.<p>Ramna-Neko crouched amidst its remains.<p>The other three demons looked warily at one another and began to back away. Ranma was on them in a flash, demon blood spraying the Dojo's walls.<p>Akane passed over the clinic on her way to the closest Demon's she had sensed, she noticed how Doctor Tofu rushed out of the clinic moving at a speed that was almost inhuman.<p>That chilled her, Kasumi and Dr. Tofu were pair of those lucky beings who were soul mates. For Tofu to be going that fast meant that Kasumi was in grave danger, she only hoped Ranma dealt with the trouble in time.<p>Akane snarled as she realized she was not going fast enough.<p>People were dying.<p>Her Nerima was being attacked<p>Immediately her full aura came out. For an instant Akane was no more.<p>Then where she had been before was a globe of black-blue energy no bigger then a marble.<p>It expanded immensely blanketing the entirety of Nerima, causing the entire ward to plunge into darkness.<p>Darkness that made humans and demons alike quiver in fear.<p>The Hunter was here.<p>Humans ran into their homes, trying to escape the awful darkness. Doctor Tofu ignored it, racing towards his beloved.<p>Demons froze in what awful tasks they were doing and began to move out of the ward...<p>They were too slow.<p>The darkness seemed to solidify around each Demon, holding them in place and slowly dissolving their physical bodies at the same time.<p>Minutes later the first demon began to scream.<p>The awful symphony of dozens of demons screaming in torment suddenly pierced the ward.<p>One by one the demons form's crumpled into dust.<p>The darkness that was the Hunter at her most powerful began to shrink back to her normal form. Power surged over the ovoid sphere of blackness that she became, golden energy that crackled and twisted like lightning coursed over her form, finally gathering near the top of the black ovoid to form her eyes.<p>The next things to appear were her wings. They exploded from the sphere, black soft feathers outspread fully.<p>Finally her body came back into being. The aura faded away completely.<p>Demoness Akane slumped into unconsciousness totally exhausted.<p>Ranma woke up to the sounds of a radio playing in the background.<p>"...The various demon hunters in Tokyo say that this has been the worst demon attack in the history of the city. Nerima has already been a little odd but demon reports of demon activity have gone up drastically since the Demoness Akane has established herself in this ward.<p>With over one hundred casualties over half of them dead or critically injured the people of Nerima are in a state of shock. The only thing that saved Nerima from becoming a ghost town was the fact that all the demons mysteriously died when a dome of blackness covered the district..."<p>Ranma turned around and saw Doctor Tofu tending Kasumi on the other futon.<p>"Heya doc. What happened?" She croaked she felt awfully sore.<p>"Hello Ranma. Well when I got here Kasumi was knocked unconscious, only a minor concussion thanks the kami. You were slumped on the ground unconscious but otherwise unhurt in the midst of several dead Demons, I guess I have you to thank for saving her."<p>Ranma gave a smirk. "Martial Artists duty and all that. Hey do you know where oyaji and Tendo-san are?"<p>"No Ranma, I haven't seen either of them all day."<p>"Tendo-san is going to freak when he sees this."<p>"Quite possible Ramna, I'm just glad she's alright. " Doctor Tofu sat back, and watched Kasumi lay there, completely at peace. Smiling slightly even in her sleep.<p>"Same Doc, she's probably the nicest girl I know... " - ...besides Akane. - He finished silently.<p>- Akane! - He sat up abruptly.<p>"Something the matter Ranma?"<p>"No."<p>Closing his eyes he reached for the part of himself had had given Akane. Ranma sighed in relief as he felt Akane's heart beat. She was ok. Though he could tell she was exhausted and her chi was nearly depleted, she would need someone to help her.<p>"I'm going to check around for more demons ok doc?"<p>"OK Ranma."<p>Ranma walked out of the dojo and began to roof hop towards Akane.<p>Ranma finally reached where Akane was, Furinken High, she looked like she was on top of the clock tower that was situated in the center of the building.<p>Ranma leaped to the third story windowsill and then used that to leap to the roof. He grimaced as he looked at the tower; it would take more then his current strength to get at it.<p>Looking around for anyone nearby he quickly shifted to Neko form, bunching his powerful legs he leapt to the clock tower.<p>Shifting back he looked around and then violently blushed, Akane was completely naked.<p>Ranma quickly shucked his pants and shirt, face red he dressed her, taking care to not too look to much he finished putting the pants on her. The shirt was a problem, her wings made it difficult to properly dress her, Ranma could see why she used low-backed leotards.<p>Putting his shirt back on he folded her wings over her front and picked her up. Ranma marveled at her lightness. He expected her to much heavier because of the strength of her blows.<p>Ranma looked off the clock tower; down was always easier then up. Taking a little leap he found himself rushing towards the ground.<p>Landing with gentleness the made it seem he had just jumped off a low curb instead of seven or eight stories up he began to sprint towards the closest of Akane's hideouts.<p>Darkness...<p>She was tired... kami so tired.<p>Belatedly she realized it was dark because she had her eyes closed.<p>Without opening her eyes she reached out with her senses.<p>She broke out into a smile when she realized Ranma was there.<p>Reaching out blindly she seized him and brought him in close so she could snuggle.<p>Ranma gave a startled squawk. "Akane? Whatcha doing?"<p>"Tired, sleepy." She murmured and then promptly went back to sleep, content that she would be safe.<p>Kami she was strong, he couldn't move, not only did her arms have a death-grip around his waist but her wings were pinning him, despite their light weight he couldn't budge them an inch.<p>Ranma felt color raising to his face as another fact came to him.<p>Akane was still half-naked.<p>She was going to kill him when she woke up!<p>Akane stirred again, though she still felt tired it wasn't the same bone-wearying numbness as before.<p>Awareness of her surroundings slowly swept over her.<p>One... she was curled up against someone...<p>Two... her arms were around that someone and his arms were around her...<p>Three... She could feel those arms around her bare back...<p>Four... It felt very nice...<p>Waitasec, her BARE back?<p>She was instantly awake. Her eyes shot open.<p>"HENTAI!"<p>**WHAM**<p>"RANMA WHAT WERE YOU DOING?"<p>Akane stared furiously at Ranma.<p>- How could he? - Were her only thoughts as she glared at him.<p>Ranma groaned from the crater against the wall. Her face was red in embarrassment and rage, a vein throbbed on her forehead and her fists were clenched, her blue/rage battle aura lit the room with its intensity.<p>The only reason she didn't let her temper control her was whatever else Ranma was he was her friend.<p>How could he do that to her?<p>Ranma awoke to pain and a very loud and angry Akane.<p>"... WHAT WERE YOU DOING?"<p>"It's not whatcha think Akane." He managed to babble as she started to stalk towards him with small angry steps.<p>"Oh really? I woke up nearly naked with your arms around me!"<p>"I found ya naked Akane on top of Furinken High. I woulda given ya my shirt as well as my pants but I couldn't get it on right." Ranma was now standing against the wall instead of plastered into it; it looked like he wished he melt through the wall.<p>"I definitely don't remember going to sleep on top of Furinken High Ranma. Especially with no top on." Her teeth were slightly gritted.<p>He shook his head. "I'm not lying Akane, that's where I found ya, I gave you my pants and adjusted your wings to cover your...ummm... front. " He flushed red and that.<p>She calmed down a bit more, she knew one thing, Ranma had never lied to her before this.<p>"All right Ranma I believe you. That doesn't explain why you had your arms around me though."<p>"Would you believe that that was your idea?"<p>"WHAT?" She shrieked in outrage, how could he expect her to believe that she would let him hug her like that without her remembering. Suddenly her checks flushed when a stray thought totally disrupted her rage.<p>"In the middle of the night I was watching over you and you grabbed me after waking briefly before going back to sleep, I could barely move around."<p>Akane thought and then let her anger completely disappear. She vaguely remembered something like that, but she had thought it had been a dream. "All right Ranma, I believe you." She repeated herself, then smiled to show Ranma that he was forgiven.<p>Ranma let out the tension he had in his body and relaxed.<p>After Akane had quickly slipped on one of her pilfered black leotards after Ranma had turned around and then slipped back on the pants Ranma had given the two of them sat on the small couch.<p>After a few moments of silence Akane spoke. "So how'd you do against the demons Ranma?"<p>"All right Akane-chan, According to Dr. Tofu I managed to stop them from doing anything besides giving Kasumi a light concussion."<p>"According to Dr. Tofu?"<p>"Ya I don't remember it, I blacked out once I saw Kasumi was hurt. How about you?"<p>Akane looked puzzled. "I remember seeing Dr. Tofu run out of the clinic and then calling on my aura, then..." She paused confused. "...Nothing, I can't remember anything after that."<p>"Huh, weird, we both blacked out?"<p>"Looks like it."<p>Ranma seemed reluctant to leave but he got up off the couch and smiled at her. "See you Demoness Akane-chan, I better go see how everyone's holding up."<p>After rechecking the Tendo's and seeing everyone was Ok, he headed to the Neko-hanten.<p>"Hey old ghoul everyone all right here?"<p>**WHAP**<p>"Everything's fine muko-dono, come to check on Shampoo have you?"<p>"Sure, she's a friend."<p>The old woman squinted at him and seemed to come to a decision.<p>"Follow me... Ranma."<p>"What's up you old bat?"<p>**WHAP**<p>"Show some respect for your elders muko-dono. As to `what's up' I want to talk to you about the Neko-Ken."<p>Ranma followed the old woman to the back room and sat in the chair she gestured too.<p>"A very, very long time ago even before the Amazons were formed the Neko-Ken was whole, only the greatest of warriors could even aspire to be selected for the test to be granted the bonding of the Shadow known as the Neko-Ken."<p>She tapped her staff lightly on the book in front of her.<p>"The greatest warriors would have to go through the First Trial of the Neko-Ken. I believe you know what I'm talking about, after all you have gone through it."<p>"The pit of c-c-c-cats?" He asked stumbling over the dread name.<p>"Yes indeed, the pit of cats. It was also known as the Trial of Fear. The warrior would become so afraid that he or she would become a cat in mind. Then the Shadow would enter him."<p>She paused.<p>"That was the way it was supposed to be done. Unfortunately a very powerful sorcerer used magic and the help of several Demon Princes to bind Neko-Ken to himself. It's power and the fact that he hadn't gone through the thirteen Trials of the Neko-Ken drove him mad. For four hundred years he terrorized most of Asia."<p>He visage grew grim... well grimmer.<p>"Around two hundred years after binding himself to the Neko-Ken the man had his army slaughter and rape a city in what is now the place where the Joketsuzoku tribe's village stands. He only left the girls aged between six and fifteen alive, most traumatized by their brutal treatment. They swore revenge and never to let that happen to them again. Those were my ancestors child."<p>Ranma shuddered at the implications.<p>"It took two hundred years of hardship and struggle but it paid off. With the help of a Demon Warlord my ancestors managed to do the impossible, the broke the Neko-Ken, in order to kill the man responsible my ancestors had to take away his power, the Shadow. Unfortunately they couldn't just destroy its bonds; they had to break the Neko-Ken apart. It shattered into thirteen parts, representing the trials."<p>"That child is how the Neko-Ken came to its present state. "<p>"Child, you have undergone two of the thirteen trials. The first was Fear, the first trial of the Neko-Ken. The second was today, when you confronted those five demons today at the Tendo home. That one was known as the Trial of Bloodlust. You grew so enraged at the sight of a hurt one you desired to see your enemies bleed."<p>The elder sighed.<p>"Muko-Dono, Ranma, each trial is supposed to bring the person closer and closer to the cat which is the Neko-Ken. The third trial will be that of Trial of Berserk Fury, instead of totally regressing into the rage of bloodlust, or withdrawing from the world in fear you will have a modicum of control of it, a tiny portion of human intelligence only but some control. Each trial is like that, you gain more and more control and awareness of your actions. I wish you good luck muko-dono. However if you fail be warned, my people will be watching you, we swore we would never let the Neko-Ken be a threat again and if you have to die for that to happen then so be it."<p>The old woman turned and hopped up the stairs leaving Ranma to stare into space. He didn't notice Shampoo until it was to late.<p>"AIREN!"<p>**GLOMP**<p>**SPLASH**<p>"AHHHHHHHHHHH!"<p>Ranma suddenly felt herself screaming and running around trying to dislodge a purple cat.<p>Ranma later found himself panting near the pool in the high schools yard, Shampoo had become dislodged when he had crashed through the wall then chased him a good ways.<p>"I can't believe it, Shampoo turned into a c-c-c-cat." He muttered as he turned and looked warily around then nodded to himself... good no Shampoo.<p>Ranma wandered around town, watching the grim faced people go around their daily tasks.<p>Yesterday's attack had really shaken the district; friends and family had been injured or killed in the unprecedented attack.<p>Watching everyone Ranma grew grim and swore then to himself he would not let this happen again.<p>Someone had known Akane had left her home and had informed the Demons of her absence.<p>Ranma didn't notice the shadow above him as he trudged along the fence, eyes downcast.<p>"So how is everyone Ranma?"<p>"Oh hey Akane-Chan, your ex-family is all fine, Kasumi is resting in bed with Doctor Tofu looking after her, me and your pop are preparing to fortify the house so it will be harder to break in, Nabiki seemed ok. I headed over the Nekohanten to check on the old ghoul, she and Shampoo were fine I don't think they were attacked. She told me some things about the Neko-Ken." Ranma frowned deepened as he turned his thoughts to his other problems<p>"Oh really?"<p>"Ya, apparently when Kasumi was attacked I slipped into the Neko-Ken and underwent the second trial of the Neko-Ken."<p>"The second trial?"<p>"Ya apparently in order to master the Neko-Ken you have to undergo thirteen trials, the first involved the pit of c-cats, the second was... ummm... bloodlust or something like that."<p>"What's the third trial?"<p>"Berserk rage."<p>Akane blinked. "How do you plan to do that?"<p>"I have no idea Akane-chan, I have no idea."<p>Kuno paced back and forth.<p>"I have no choice, the foul sorcerer has made it so that the fair pigtailed one will never return mine affections. Not only does he perform the black arts he also is in league with the foul daemon Akane! Such a duo could spell doom for the world."<p>The reason he had never taken this route before was because he would lose himself completely to the spirit within the sword.<p>He slowly went into the dark mansion and approached a small shrine. Entering the shrine he stood in front of a Katana that was firmly set in a stone pedestal.<p>"I AM KUNO TATEWAKI, DESCENDANT OF THE GREATEST DEMON HUNTER IN JAPAN. BY THE GREAT ONES I ASK OF THEE TO RID THIS WORLD OF EVIL. I BIND MYSELF TO THEE WITH MY LIFE'S BLOOD!"<p>His voice seemed to echo throughout like mighty peals of thunder.<p>He grasped the katana just above the hilt, causing the sharp edges to bite into his flesh. In response a glow appeared then intensified. Soon an explosion rocked the estate<p>Mousse scowled at the waters in front of him. Thanks to the guide's ineptness now he was cursed to become a duck. How in the seven hells did a duck drown?<p>Maybe turning Saotome into a duck would dissuade him from Shampoo and prevent him from helping the Hunter.<p>No, he had learned from the old bag that Ranma was afraid of cats, what would be more fitting punishment then to drive Ranma insane with fear.<p>Maybe the Hunter would be affected by Jusenkyou also... now what curse would be most suitable?<p>**GALUMP**<p>**GALUMP**<p>**GALUMP**<p>**GALUMP**<p>"It's a runaway horse! Get out of the way!"<p>"AHHHHHHHHH SHAMPOO GO AWAY!"<p>**CRASH**<p>**BANG**<p>Akane clutched her sides laughing in near agony, she stopped for a few minutes as she gasped for breath and looked at Ranma. She then broke out laughing again when as she saw his sullen expression.<p>"Oh sure laugh it up."<p>"So-sorry Ranma, it's just you were competing with a monkey in a Martial Arts Tea Ceremony contest, to marry the guy at that. It just sounds so stupid!"<p>"Hey the monkey was good! And it was a challenge, I never turn down a challenge!" He then grinned sheepishly. "You're right it does sound kinda funny."<p>Both of them heard a click of the door opening behind them.<p>"Ranma? Akane? Could... ummm... Could I talk to you?" Both of them stared in surprise at the meek form of Nabiki standing in the doorway.<p>Well here it is, On Wings of Black 9<p>Hope you enjoyed the latest installment, ya this chapter was a little dark, don't worry it'll lighten up again.<p>I've noticed the woman of the Takahashi Universe respond to most unwanted situations involving Ranma with physical violence... on Ranma.<p>In fact I remember when Ranma pretending to be Soun's wife swatted Soun on the head with a mallet when Miss Hinako was proposing to him.<p>Part of the humor of her work.<p>It's true for ALL the fiancees of Ranma. Akane just gets picked on more because she is around Ranma the most.<p>Shampoo swats him with her large Bonbori.<p>Ukyou uses her Giant Spatula.<p>Akane, well she uses everything from her fists and feet to large stone objects to miscellaneous furniture.<p>The thing is Akane and Ranma ARGUE more then Ranma and Ukyo, or Shampoo and Ranma. What do you expect? They are forcefully engaged to each other against their will and are to stubborn to admit that they might just like the other, simple because that would make their father's right in forcing them to get engaged.<p>What does this have to do with the story?<p>Nothing... I just wanted to put forth my opinion on the whole Anti-Akane thingy that portrays Akane as a violent bitch.<p>Well on to the relevant portion of my Author's Notes, Akane's reaction to waking up in Ranma's arms.<p>What woman wouldn't violently shove someone away they don't remember going to sleep with?<p>Especially if they woke up half-naked when the definitely didn't go to sleep in that state at that!<p>When Akane found out it was Ranma she felt slightly betrayed, yet she was relieved to find out Ranma was innocent of any wrongdoing, she actually gave him a chance to explain himself!<p>Heaven forbid, Akane LISTENING to Ranma's explanations!<p>THE APOCALYPSE IS COMING!
