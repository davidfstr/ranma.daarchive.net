</div><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Authors note:</b> <i>The basic story is still the same, just  greatly re-edited and some (ok, a </i><i>LOT</i><i>!) of the screwy dialogue clarified. The story is  now told in TWO chapters, not due to any continuation after the original ending  but because it was easier for me to split it into two files</i></p><p style="text-align:center;">Is Ranma-chan hurt?</p><p style="text-align:center;">By Nuki Mouse</p><p>This  is a Ranma ½ fanfic based on characters owned and copyrighted Takahashi Rumiko  and VIZ communications. It is lime flavored but is not a lemon. It is  also not really a dark tale, but does deal with adult situations that every  girl faces when they are suddenly no longer a girl,  but a young woman, even one that is actually a cursed young man.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>Author's</u><u> Note and are used to bracket the <b>Thoughts</b> of the  characters</u>.</p><p>To all first time readers of a Ranma ½ story, remember that Ranma  is a 16 year old VERY masculine male, who changes into a very sexy petite  redhead girl when splashed with cold water due to a curse he acquired only a  few months ago. (Hot water changes him back.)   Ranma is sometimes called Ranma-chan when he is female in my story,  Ryouga is a friend (?) of his who is male, and Akane is his true fiancée,  although both Ukyou and Shampoo also consider <i>themselves </i>his  fiancée.</p><p style="text-align:center;">The Story</p><p>Kasumi peered into her laundry room to investigate the strange  noises coming from it.  I thought  there was no one in there. as she crept in though the door.  There she found Ranma-chan, sitting on a  stool before the washbasin, dressed in one of Akane's old sundresses.  Ranma must have appropriated that from my  clean laundry bin.</p><p>She was busy, methodically washing a pair of her Chinese pants, and  had not noticed Kasumi's presence behind her.</p><p>How strange, Ranma-chan  has never tried to help with the laundry before. As a matter of fact, Ranma has  never liked doing anything he considered to be a <i>feminine task</i>  before Kasumi realized while she watched the girl finish rinsing out the  soap and start to squeeze out the excess water from her pants.</p><p>"May I help you, Ranma-chan?"  Kasumi finally asked, just as Ranma-chan had  finished wringing out the garment.  You  would have thought Kasumi had stuck her with a pin the way the startled girl  jumped up off the stool in surprise, almost dropping the pants back into the  basin as she spun around to face the speaker.</p><p>"Ugh... Kasumi!  I... um...  fine!   I... ugh... don't need any help" said Ranma-chan as she quickly  balled up pair of pants and tried to hide them behind her back.</p><p>"Now, now, Ranma-chan, they'll wrinkle that way," replied  Kasumi, as she tried to reach around the girl and retrieve the garment from  Ranma-chan's hands.</p><p>"They're... um... OK, Kasumi.   I am... um, all done." Ranma replied as she shied away from Kasumi,  edging closer and closer to the door.   "I'll just hang this up later!"  Ranma-chan continued as she suddenly darted  pass Kasumi and bolted from the room, taking the pants along with her as well  as a pair of wet boxer shorts that had been draped across the basin's  edge.</p><p>Kasumi shook her head in amusement as she watched the departing  young girl, a slight smile on her lips.   Things are never boring with Ranma around! Kasumi thought.  Now I have a mystery solve,<i> what is  Ranma up to now?</i> Kasumi told herself, as she started to clean up the  mess left in her laundry room by Ranma.</p><p>Really!  I have no problem with Ranma washing his own  clothes, OPPS!  I mean hers! (with a silent chuckle)   However, she <b><i>must </i></b>learn to clean up afterwards!  I will not condone a messy house!  as she noticed  the spilled soap powder and various other cleaning supplies that Ranma-chan had  scattered across the floor.</p><p>When she approached the  basin, she noticed that wash water inside was tinted pink in color.  What? Kasumi pondered the water and  its implications. What is this?  Is it... blood?  In the water?  Could Ranma be  bleeding?</p><p>Kasumi then quickly looked around for any more evidence of injury.  At first, the search was fruitless until she spied a suspicious smear on the  stool near the basin</p><p>Oh My!  Here is some more blood! She thought, as  she closely examined the smear.   Maybe it is not<i> 'What is Ranma up to'</i> but<i> Is Ranma-chan hurt?</i>   Moreover, why is she hiding it from me?</p><p>Ranma-chan dashed into the guestroom she shared with her pop and  quickly shut the door behind her. She spun around and pressed an ear against  the door trying to hear if Kasumi had followed her.  When satisfied that her escape had been  successful, she quickly hide the wet garments behind her dresser and slumped  down onto the bed.</p><p>KAMI-SAMA!  That was close, Kasumi is the last person I  want ta know 'bout this, 'cept  for Akane of course! Ranma thought, as a slight film of moisture formed  around her tear ducts. The memories of the morning returned to her as she  fought back the tears. Real men don't cry! She  reminded her herself.</p><p>Why did this have ta happen?  Having this damn cursed female form is bad  enough, but now this!  And with Ryouga...  Ranma gritted  her teeth and clutched her arms tightly across her chest, as she tried to drive  the memory from her mind.  No, I gotta face this, I gotta figure it out... she decided. Maybe I'm hurt... Maybe the blood is from... somethin'  else... as she tried to deny the recent events.</p><p>Ranma gingerly pulled up the hem of her dress and pulled down the  purloined panties to examine herself again.  She could not help but noticed the dampness  down "there".  She reached her hand down  to her groin and ran her fingers though the red hair as she further examined  herself.  UH...  Blood? She thought in shook, as she looked the moisture on her hand.  It's still  bleeding as tears once again formed around her eyes and threatened to burst  forth.</p><p>I wish I spent more time listenin' ta the Sensei rather than sleepin'  during those blasted Sex Ed classes! Ranma bemoaned.  This is somethin'  I thought would never happen!  but what if... its like in my dreams... she thought in  horror.</p><p>Is this my worse nightmares comin' ta life? And ta  think I use ta just dream of ca... ca...  CATS! She thought as her body shook in fear as she remembered her latest  recurrent nightmare.</p><p>…<i>She was in  Toufu-sensei's clinic, lying naked on a stainless steel table with her legs  held wide apart by some type of fiendish torture device. </i> <i>"*Well Ranma-chan*" taunted an evil version  of Toufu, "*Now that you decided to be a TRUE female, you curse is gone!  You will never transform again!  You are in your TRUE FORM FOREVER!*" cried  the demon doctor.  But  I'm still a GIRL!  I AM STILL A  GIRL!  <b>I AM SUPPOSED TO BE A GUY!  </b>She yelled back as all the girls  Ranma-chan ever knew where suddenly there, yelling out their congratulations to  her...</i>.</p><p>While pushing out the memory of her nightmare, Ranma-chan realized,  I need... help, I need...   advice! She flopped down on her futon and tried to bury her tears  and fears in her pillow.  But who?  ...Not Kasumi, that would be like tellin'  my mother!  Maybe a real <u>gir</u>l  might do that, but not me! her thoughts raced.</p><p>Tell Pop instead?   Wait... am I crazy?  After today, I feel like I just might be!  as she continued trying to figure out what to do.</p><p>Um... Akane? YACK!  That's the worst  thing I coulda do. This is somethin'  I hope she never finds out, She'd never understand…  Ranma thought in disgust and dismissed  this idea  out of hand with a shake of  her head.</p><p>Advice, I need advice... of course, Nabiki!  She might help me: she has in the past!  Plus I know she'll  keep this a secret... for a price!  But it may be worth it, Ranma-chan decided, rising from  her bed and headed for the door.</p><p>Ranma lightly knocked on the Nabiki's door, hoping that no one else  (especially Akane!) would hear it and investigate.  Nabiki opened the door and her eyes went  round in surprise as she took in the unusual sight of Ranma in a dress, not to  mention the frightened, tearful expression on her face.</p><p>"Ranma-chan, May I…  <i>help</i><i> you</i>?"  She asked, phrasing it as a leading question,  hoping that Ranma would stick her head in the noose all by herself.</p><p>"Nabiki!  I need your advice, ...um...  I  need your... HELP! Ranma said with the last word  coming as a high-pitched squeak.  She  leaned forward though the doorway so that she could whisper into Nabiki ears,  "But this must never... ever... be revealed ta anyone</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow and a slight predatory grin appeared on  her face.  AH!  Just as my finances were getting low!  She gestured for  Ranma-chan to enter her room,  Come  into my parlor, said the spider to the fly she quoted to herself, as she  thought of fat bank accounts.</p><p>Ranma quickly entered Nabiki's bedroom, while keeping her eyes down  cast and her whole body had blushed red in embarrassment.   "Um... Nabiki?  Um… ah...  This is a, um... <i>female thing</i>"  She finally managed to say as her face turned almost as red as her hair.</p><p>Nabiki's eyes lit up and  you could almost hear a "Ka Ching!  Ka Ching!"  of a cash register  drawer opening.  <b>JACKPOT</b>!  she mentally screamed. If this was a cartoon she knew  there would be a giant dollar sign over her head right now.</p><p>"Can you <i>elaborate</i> on this <i>thing </i>?"  she asked of the  scared girl. Come  on, stick your neck out just a wee bit more... Nabiki silently coaxed the  girl as she led Ranma over and sat her on the futon.</p><p>"I was fightin' with Ryouga and  then..."  Ranma-chan's voice trailed  off, becoming too low to understand as she drew legs up to her chest and  wrapped her arms around her knees in a fetal position.</p><p>"Speak up!" demanded Nabiki as she sat down on a nearby  chair, "I can't hear you if you're mumbling."</p><p>"Well, we were grapplin' and  then..."   Her voice again becoming  too low to hear, but this time Nabiki leaned forward in her chair to listen to  the faint the whispers of Ranma's voice.</p><p>"WHAT?"  yelled out to a shocked Nabiki, interrupting the girl's confession, "You…,  while with Ryouga?  ...Wait!" Nabiki  grabbed Ranma by the shoulders and shook her in frustration. "Start over at the  beginning and<i> this  time don't mumble!<b>"</b></i><b></b></p><p>"I was hungry for some ice cream, so I um... changed into a  girl.  Ya know  that ol' man Misaki is,  a… um, ...push over  for an extra large portion when I'm... well... in my girl form."</p><p>Ice-cream? At 9:00 in the morning!  Well, to each their own...  Nabiki thought  as she nodded her head in acknowledgement.   Unlike Akane, she had no trouble with Ranma-chan using her feminine  wiles to con dirty old men out of food, or even money for that matter!  Nabiki just wished that she was as cute and as sexy as Ranma's female form.</p><p>Trust a <b>boy </b>to have the prettiest face and hottest body  in all of Nerima!  Hmm...  Then again, his male body is just as good Nabiki observed, remembering all  the times she had 'accidentally' walk in on Ranma while he was in the bath.</p><p>"Well" Ranma continued, "I was on my way home when  Ryouga caught up with me!  I wasn't in  the mood for a fight, bein' a girl and all, so I took  off through that wooded area in the park, hopin' ta lose him.  I  stopped runnin' when he... well... accused me of runnin' out on a fight again!" confessed Ranma.  "Then I just <i>had</i> ta fight!"</p><p>"It seemed like we fought for hours before we both started ta get too tried ta continue.  We finally  ended up just wrestlin', trying ta  pin each other.  Except in my female form,  I wasn't strong enough, I just couldn't... um...  WIN!" Ranma admitted.</p><p>"But I just couldn't, <i>wouldn't</i>, allow  Ryouga ta BEAT me, either.  I managed ta wrap  my legs 'round a tree so that Ryouga couldn't pin me" Ranma-chan further  admitted as she gave one of Nabiki's pillows a whole body hug and started to  blush again.</p><p>"He... um, managed ta get his hand 'tween my legs and was pullin'  them apart, tryin' ta pry  me off that damn tree." She continued as her whole body started to tremble.  "Then I started ta feel..., you know, different…,  down THERE!" Ranma said as her eyes quickly darted down to her groin area,  "Kind of a sticky, squishy feeling all at the same time."</p><p>"Just then Ryouga finally got 'nough  leverage ta break my  hold.  With his strength, he managed ta force my legs apart... I couldn't  hold on ta that tree anymore!  I fell flat on my back, pullin'  Ryouga down with me!  I couldn't help it,  he landed smack dap on top of me, right between my legs!" cried the ashamed  girl.</p><p>I tried ta get free, ta  push him offa me, but Ryouga  was pressin' down on me. I think he was still tryin' ta pin me!   Then I got a sudden feeling of wetness... um... <i>Down There</i>!"  Ranma bemoaned as she again glanced at her  groin.</p><p>"And I,   um... WE...  gulp! Well...  um... couldn't stop it…, IT JUST HAPPEN!"   Ranma-chan cried out, blushing right down to the roots of her hair as  she buried her face in the pillow in shame.</p><p>After a few moments Ranma-chan timidly, quietly, started to talk  again. "I, ah...  still don't know  just what happen!  And Ryouga..., he  seemed to be just as, um... <i>confused…</i> as me!"</p><p>"Neither of us knew what was goin' on,  just that once it started or happened or what ever, I... ugh, 'IT'… <i>wouldn't</i>... STOP!  Then blood, from …IT..., was  all over my groin..., on RYOUGA!  He... he... (sniff) ran off…" her  tears burst forth as Ranma-chan started to sob.</p><p>KAMI!  You  better be ready to pay off BIG for this! Nabiki thought half  jokingly. This may put me all the way through college! then mentally  chastised herself.</p><p>This is a very serious matter! Nabiki realized as she moved  from her chair to the futon and put her arms around Ranma-chan to comfort her.</p><p>Ranma-chan looked up at Nabiki in gratitude, tears still streaming  from her face and she fiercely hugged Nabiki back before breaking off the  embrace with a start and retreating to the far side of the bed.  "I… um, managed ta  get home without <i>anyone </i>seeing me. At least I don't think anyone <i>saw </i>me,  or Ryouga, while we where… um... um... fightin' in  the woods."  A thoroughly  embarrassed and upset Ranma finished, as her voice once more trailed off to  silence.</p><p>"Well, then what?"  Nabiki demanded, her interest still piqued, "Did you… um… <i>WASHUP</i>?"  Nabiki asked, as she glanced down at  Ranma-chan's groin area with a slightly disgusted look on her face.  I don't SEE any  stains on that dress…</p><p>"I… ah... hid down in  the laundry room. I... um, well, I had no clean clothes and I could only find  this damn sun-dress… so I could't change back  yet."  Ranma glanced at Nabiki, hoping  that she wouldn't press her for the real reason she  didn't change back yet.</p><p>How could I <i>explain</i> that to HER, that I'm  scared!  Me, ol'macho-man  Ranma himself, that I'm afraid…, afraid of what's happenin' to me.   Afraid I'd somehow changed, that I might be  stuck female! Ranma-chan thought again of her new nightmare.  I'll never tell  anyone 'bout THAT dream!</p><p>Realizing Nabiki was waiting for a, Ranma continued  "Therefore I used just cold water, I washed up best I could in the basin, then  I slipped on the dress and… uh, a pair of Akane's panties I also found."</p><p>Yew, wearing someone else's panties, she's  been hanging out with Uncle Happi too much!  Nabiki thought in disgust, "That explains why there's no stains, though.  I should have guessed Ranma changed clothes  when I saw her in a dress!  But, if she  didn't properly… ah…<i> clean   herself</i> or use a…,  then she still would...   She knew  that Ranma-chan had absolutely no experience in female matters or hygiene.</p><p>I have to do something to help her with that Nabiki decided  as she observed the scared, panicky look in Ranma's face and eyes.</p><p>"Ranma, do you anything know  about...?" she started then changed tacts, "Did you  use a...?"  Nabiki voice trailed off  again.  Careful!  I need to word is just right,  I really do not  want to scare her any further!</p><p>"Use a... what?  Come  on, Nabiki, you know me, I'm a guy!  I never paid any attention ta all that female stuff in Sex Ed class!"  Ranma-chan pleaded as she look  at Nabiki with her big round eyes, brimming again with tears. "That's why  I'm here, ta ask YOU, for ...um,  help, advice, whatever!"</p><p>Nabiki glanced out the door and seeing no one in the hallway, she  quickly led Ranma to the empty bathing room. "Let's get that dress off  you, Ranma" Nabiki suggested after shutting the  door, but not before hanging out the "in use" sign.</p><p>"Nabiki! Y-yo- you... c -ca-can't meeaan...! "Ranma stuttered  out in apprehension of what Nabiki had in mind and her arms nervously clutched  her dress tightly to her body.</p><p>"Come on Ranma, you're a girl right now!  And it's not like I haven't seen your female  body nude before!"  Nabiki  interrupted.  You <i>really</i> are a  girl, at least for the moment, there is no doubt about that now!  "Nabiki smirked in amusement.</p><p>With that, Ranma slowly but reluctantly, removed Akane's dress and  underwear, the later already strained red from further bleeding.</p><p>Those aren't  Akane's panties! They're MINE!  HERS are all covered in polka-dots!  thought Nabiki as she recognized the familiar color of her own underwear and  she mentally added the price (and a hefty penalty!) to Ranma's account.</p><p>Nabiki then proceeded to help Ranma to wash up again, properly this  time, after making sure the water wasn't too  warm.  Akane, you're just lucky that  I wouldn't steal Ranma from you, a little more heat in this water right now,  and I really <i>would</i> have him in the palm of my hands, <i>literally! </i>  Nabiki thought as she wondered just how she was going to explain, well, <i>everything  </i>Ranma-chan needed to know.</p><p>Oh baby!  Here we go!  thought Nabiki, as she led Ranma over to the cabinet were the various  "feminine" products were kept.   This is going to be fun, just watching his... er...  her face as I show and explain all this!</p><p>Nabiki first grabbed a container of pre-mixed disposable douche,  which Ranma vaguely remembered seeing on one of those cryptic TV commercials  about that "spring morning fresh feeling" that she couldn't, or  didn't want to, quite understand.</p><p>"Wha...  what's that for?"  a nervous Ranma  asked as she eyed the strange looking bottle.</p><p>"It is for cleaning you... um... up <i>inside</i>" Nabiki  replied as she proceeded to tell <i>and demonstrate</i> to Ranma exactly what  she meant by "<i>inside".   </i>The  look on her face is priceless! Snickered Nabiki, as she wished she had  brought her camera with her. Damn it!  I could have made a mint from some photos of  her right now!</p><p>Over the next few minutes, Nabiki showed and instructed Ranma in  all the various items stored inside the cabinet.  Ranma was surprised to find that being female  was a lot more "high maintenance" than she could have ever  guessed.  Finally, the only things that  remained were the two boxes Nabiki had saved for last.</p><p>Ranma-chan could not help but notice the strange look in Nabiki's  eyes as she sent out the first mysterious box.   With that glint in her eyes and the smirk on her face, I know I ain't goin' ta  like this! Ranma thought as she tried to read the item's name.  Maxi... something...  pod's?  No...</p><p>Nabiki, after pausing for dramatic effect, slid the first box aside  and with an almost predatory grin, set down the second.</p><p>Tampon?   Ranma-chan pondered the mysterious box.  Isn't that a  city in America?  um...  famous for it's cigars?</p><p>This observation seemed to be confirmed when Nabiki slowly removed  a 6 in. long cylinder wrapped in white paper and held it up for Ranma-chan to  see.</p><p>I thought they use clear plastic ta  wrap cigars? Wondered Ranma-chan.   Wait...  <i>cigars</i>?  Why would Nabiki show me <i>cigars</i>?  Ranma-chan eyes  went wide with surprise as Nabiki un-wrapped the odd object.</p><p>"W -wh-wha-  what is... t-th- that!"  Ranma stuttered out as she stared at the  strange plastic tube in Nabiki's right hand.</p><p>KAMI!  Ranma!  I know you are naive but even you should know  what this is! thought Nabiki as she got out the enclosed instruction  booklet and handed it to the confused Ranma-chan.</p><p>"Ugggh!  ...no, <i>no</i>, NO, <i>NO,<b>  NO, NOO!</b></i>"  Ranma's fearful  cries escalated in volume as the meaning of the instructions sunk in.</p><p>"Come on, Ranma, this is all part of it...," Nabiki  stated in a no nonsense voice, but the twinkle in her eye gave away her hidden  mirth.</p><p>"B- b- but!"   Ranma-chan stuttered as she clutched both hands tightly over her groin  to deny access to anyone or anyTHING!</p><p>"Look, Ranma-chan, I know that before you were cursed, you  never had to know any of this, but now you do!   Moreover, it's best that I show you exactly how!"  she couldn't resist  in adding with a predatory grin.</p><p>"Don't you realize that Kasumi had to do  the same thing for me, that I was almost as clueless as you are?"  confessed Nabiki.  All time she was  saying this, Nabiki was slowly approaching Ranma-chan, holding the Tampon in  her right hand like a giant hypodermic syringe and using her left to pull  Ranma-chan's hands away from their protective hold on her womanhood.</p><p>Ranma just stood there, her eyes round with fear, frozen, like a deer caught in the headlights...</p><p>I don't think this scene needs  to go any further. If you want to know what happen-GUESS! Nuki_Mouse  :-)</p><p>A few minutes later a thoroughly subdued Ranma sat dejectedly on  the bath stool, listening to Nabiki finish up her lectures on feminine  hygiene.</p><p>"Ranma-chan" Nabiki suddenly said, looking directly into  Ranma's eyes, "this part is very serious, I need to talk you about  pregnancy."</p><p>"P... pr- preg... preg-na- na-  nancy!" stuttered Ranma, "I don't need ta know nothin' 'bout that!" she  said tersely as she rapidly shook her in denial</p><p>"Ranma, after today this is something you do need to know  about.  Any 'unprotected' girl can get  pregnant, any time they, um... '<b>DO IT'</b>... even if it's their first time,  whether they're in cycle, out of cycle, well just about any time!" For some  strange reason an old joke (<i>What do you call people who use the rhythm method?  ...Parents!)</i> warning  about that jumped into Nabiki's mind as she lectured Ranma. "If they '<b>DO</b> <b>IT'</b>, they can get pregnant!"   Nabiki bluntly continued.</p><p>"But I can't...  I wouldn't... not me!" Ranma muttered as all the  ramifications of what Nabiki was saying and the days events threaten to  overwhelm her.</p><p>"Ranma-chan, after what happened today you could...  um..." Nabiki stopped, as she realized that Ranma-chan was about ready to  bolt from the room and quickly positioned herself in front of the door.</p><p><i>"<b><u>RANMA!</u></b>"</i>Nabiki yelled in order to get the frightened girl's attention as  she decided to try a different tact.   "What if one day you got drunk, and THEN you changed!  You know what a low tolerance your female  body has for alcohol; you could pass out or find that you can't defend  yourself!" Nabiki contended.  "And then  there are all those new date rape drugs!   Remember, there's a lot of scum-bags out  there!"</p><p>"I..   won't... won't... let it happen!"  Retorted Ranma-chan as she subconsciously  placed her arms protective across her groin again.</p><p>"Do you actually  THINK that a rape victim LETS it  happen!" Nabiki yelled in indignation at the girl as she waved her arms about  in agitation.  "But it still happens, all  the time!  Every day young girls get taken advantage of, assaulted, raped, or worse!  It could happen to anyone! Even  to you, Ranma!" Nabiki concluded.</p><p>After Ranma stood silent for a moment, she slowly walked over to  the tub.  Glancing back over her  shoulder, she asked Nabiki if she could leave her alone for a while.  "I want to take a bath"  Ranma admitted shyly. I MUST face my nightmare... sometime...</p><p>A bath?  You <i>want</i> me to leave  for that? Nabiki, like most Japanese females, routinely bathed nude with  others of the same sex.  Don't tell me that you're getting suddenly shy on me  again? she wondered.  Oh! Kami!,  how stupid can I be! Nabiki cursed herself, She means she wants to  change back into a man! Nabiki silently laughed at herself for forgetting  about THAT.</p><p>"Wait Ranma, before  you...  Change...  There is one last thing we need to discuss. I  think a doctor, a Gynecologist, should check you out." Nabiki stated and  then braced herself for the forthcoming explosion.</p><p>"A gynecologist!" Ranma yelled in horror at Nabiki's request. "Only girls have ta go there, I don't need one, I  won't go!  I'm really a guy, not a  GIRL!" she raved, despite the very obvious  evidence to the contrary at that moment.</p><p>"Gynecologist treats both men and women, Ranma. With what  happened today, you should really get a checkup, the sooner the better" Nabiki said as she tried to reason with Ranma,  hoping to convince her of the wisdom of her request.</p><p>No one really likes to visit a GYN, but… with Ranma's curse and  all, maybe… hmm… I know! Nabiki thought in a flash.  "Dr Toufu!   He's not a GYN, but he's still a pretty good  doc, at least when Kasumi isn't around and he's already familiar with Ranma's  curse!</p><p>"How about we make a  compromise, Ranma. Instead of a GYN, you could  go see Dr Toufu" Nabiki stated, putting her idea  in motion. "We could go right now, he's never  busy this time of day."</p><p>"WE?  What do ya  mean by WE?"   Ranma cried out in panic at the suggestion, feeling like a rat trapped  in a maze, DR TOUFU!  No,  I CAN'T...</p><p>"I figured that you may need some moral support" Nabiki  replied.  With all the times he's been hurt, I would think a trip to Toufu's  would be old hat to him by now, she thought, wondering why the idea of a  doctor's visit suddenly seemed to terrify Ranma so much.  .</p><p>It was a dream, just a dream, Ranma tried to reassure  herself. I don't have ta  go..., but I can't hide, either. That's not manly, I  know Doc!  He's  no demon Ranma rationalized, trying to overcome her fear.  I still don't wanta go!  But if Nabiki thinks I need it, I'd better... Ranma-chan  finally decided and nodded her head in acquiescence.</p><p>"Are ya sure you want ta  come with me?" Ranma asked Nabiki hesitantly.</p><p>"Honestly Ranma, do you actually believe I'm so cold-blooded I'd  let you go though this ordeal by yourself?" answered Nabiki in a mock-hurt  voice.  Plus I wouldn't  want to miss THIS visit for all the gold in Fort Knox!</p><p>Next Chapter: "In The Lair Of Doctor Toufu…."</p><p>.</p>
