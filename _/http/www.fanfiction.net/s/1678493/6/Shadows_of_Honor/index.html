</div>Chapter 6:Ranma's First Day, Cologne's Plan, Kasumi's feelings.<p>Akane quickly ran up to Ranma, currently in the process of walking over Kuno, with a blank mind. She really didn't know what to think. Ranma had taken her side again. He openly challenged Kuno to a duel and utterly disgraced him, for her.<p>Her anger already forgotten, she went forward to talk to Ranma to ask him if he was feeling alright. The way he fought, even if it was the same as before, seemed to be more powerful and effective. He had become quicker. Maybe he had been trying to make his male side as fast as his female side.<p>As Akane reached Kuno, she looked down at him for a second in disgust deciding to continue after Ranma. She stopped in mid-stride however when she noticed something odd. Adjacent to Kuno's leg, there was a lop-sided hole on the ground.<p>'Hmm I wonder how that came about. A sweep doesn't make an impression like that.' she thought to herself. Noticing that Ranma had already almost reached the building door, she quickly ran up to him.<p>"Ranma, wait up!" Akane spoke, causing Ranma to turn and look at her.<p>"What's taking you so long? I thought ya didn't wanna be late? You should've gone already."<p>"You idiot! How could I? I mean... why did you do that?"<p>"Do what?"<p>"You know what I'm talking about!"<p>Ranma looked at her with an expression which exhibited vexation.<p>"Akane, did you not hear me? I already said that my honor will not let them treat you like that. It's simple." Ranma said, trying to speak properly.<p>The more he practiced, the better it would be. He was quite embarrased last evening because he could not express himself well enough.<p>"But you said that you wanted to practice on those guys!"<p>"I did, I also wanted to do this. I did it... what, aren't you happy that they will most probably leave you alone now, except for maybe Kuno."<p>"I said I didn't need your help for that! Why do you keep on treating me like I am a baby! I'm a martial artist too!"<p>Ranma lost his temper.<p>"I am NOT treating you like a baby! You didn't seem to mind last week when I took care of them. Why all of sudden this?" he asked, exasperated.   "I did not like them treating you like that, they have no right. I tried   to put and end to it. It is really simple! Whadya have to make it so complicated. It is how it is. I ain't treating you like a baby, I just did something because I care for you DAMNIT!" he shouted, trying to make sure he made he got the last word.<p>Akane went quiet for a change at this. Ranma had admitted feelings for her again. This felt quite nice. She felt the gazes of many people on her, which made her realize that they were still pretty much outside.<p>Everybody must have heard that! She hid her face behind her book bag and quickly ran into the building, hoping no one would see her blush.<p>"Baka!"<p>Ranma stood there, dumbfounded again at her behavior. "Just when you think you got her figured out." he muttered. He started to walk in when something landed on his head, splashing liquid out as it bounced off and landed on the ground.<p>Turning to look at what it was, an irked female Ranma realised it was a plastic water bottle. Someone must have dropped it by mistake, or on purpose. He didn't bother looking up to who might be.<p>It didn't change anything. He was in for quite a day. Well, the morning started off really great. Maybe if he would pay attention to class, the day would pass quicker. But then again, sleeping was just as good.<p>Strange, he was beginning to wonder if his water attraction ability had worn off. It was just like him to get wet when he was least expecting it.<p>Ranma sighed and went into the school and prepared himself to hold buckets. He hadn't sensed that object fall. Either it was too small for his senses to pick it up or maybe he couldn't sense properly when he was angry. The latter appeared to be more probable.<p>"Pig tailed one... thou hast come at last... I have faced peril after peril, and even that demon, enchanter Saotome for you, it could be possible to show thy love for me to help me up..." said Kuno weakly. He was on his knees, unable to stand.<p>The pig tailed martial artist - turned girl turned around and looked at him with understanding. He (she) had a feeling he knew what Kuno was going through.<p>Koryu's attacks had a lingering effect on you once they hit. Ranma had infused ki throughout his whole body during the short fight. He must have done much more damage than would be normally visible, even with the sweep and pointed edge of the splintered bokken.<p>"Get lost Kuno. You mess with me again and you will regret it."<p>With that said, Ranma walked into the school. Ranma felt better now that he knew that the effects that Kuno was feeling were similar to what he felt while fighting Koryu. It proved to Ranma that his theories were right.<br/>To make matters even better, Koryu had admitted to Kasumi that Ranma was a better ki user. That meant that he had an advantage over Koryu already. But Koryu used spirits, whatever that meant. He needed to speak to Kasumi about that. Maybe she would enlighten him.<p>Before he disappeared into the building Ranma was reminded of the first day he entered Furinkan High. It felt the same now, like it had then. Nonetheless, he could not imagine why.<p>Some distance away from Furinkan High, in a small restaurant called the 'Nekohaten', things were proceeding normally, meaning without fights. This was a first in a long while. Shampoo was serving the customers in her usual bubbly manner and was helping Cologne in the cooking.<p>Mousse was no where to be seen.<p>"Great grand mother, why Shampoo no can see airen?" Shampoo asked when she came to pickup an order.<p>"You know why, Shampoo"<p>"Shampoo still no understand" the Amazon champion glomper insisted.<p>"Shampoo, listen to me. After Phoenix Mountain, son-in-law has been under much stress. The wedding disaster has only deteriorated his condition.<br/>He needs to relax and come to terms. He has come to us many times when he needed  help. If we continuously irritate him, it will drive him away. We must let him come to us so we can help guide him." replied Cologne.<p>Shampoo bobbed her head right and left to comprehend what her great grand mother was getting at.<p>"Shampoo still no understand" she repeated.<p>Cologne sighed. 'Young blood, can be so rash at times' she thought, remembering her own days.<p>"Listen well, especially when he is angry or depressed, he does not   like open and forced affection. Since he has been forced into so many things   he doesn't like he has learned to detest it and panic. If you go to see him,   it will only cause problems. Also don't go picking fights with Akane. Ranma is   very protective of her. You should in fact try to make her angry without doing   anything wrong. She is a natural jealous type. It shouldn't be too hard for you   to make her go into a tantrum. She also has that stupid unfounded pride as a martial artist. Use that against her. If I am correct, Ranma is already quite irritated by her attitude. Get her to remain irritated, that will only help drive him away from her. As expected the family heads will try to force them together. That will cause further conflict... Are you understanding this?"<br/>Cologne had been looking at the skillet she held in her hand while she was speaking. Just to make sure Shampoo was paying attention, she turned to look at the young Amazon.<p>Shampoo nodded furiously.<p>"Hey, where's our order. Isn't it taking a little too long?" came the voice of an irate customer from behind them.<p>Shampoo quickly picked up the order, ran over and placed it on the customers' table before she returning in a hurry.<p>"Yes, Shampoo think she get the picture now. Airen always panicky when Shampoo say hi. Most men are not. They like that."<p>"I would dare to say that you should by now realize that son-in-law is  not any typical man. As I was saying. While antagonizing Akane, you should  try and appeal to son-in-law's honor, arrogance and pride. In everything he does,   he tries to find honor. Just like that time with the reversal jewel, his pride always gets him to do strange things. You need to subtly entangle his heart with kind words, and small simple things that will slowly get him to start drifting away from the Tendo girl and towards you. You have to be careful because everyone will start noticing your change in behavior. Especially that Nabiki." the elder Amazon explained.<p>Shampoo stood there thinking for a moment, her elbows on the kitchen table, resting her head in her petite, but robust hands.<p>"Is too difficult. Why not use more powerful spell or magical item to get airen. Much easier, no?"<p>Cologne sighed, wondering whose genes Shampoo had inherited to be this dense on occasion. The person to whom those genes belonged to should be shot. She knew she didn't have this trait.<p>"No you stupid girl! Think for a change. If spells or drugs would work,<br/>they would have already. These kind of methods work on normal people. Son-in-law  has too strong a focus. Besides, physical restraints can be out done by the astral side. If one's spirit or mental focus is very strong, they can resist almost any kind of temptation. I am afraid that after the fight with Saffron on Phoenix Mountain, son-in-law has become extremely powerful. That energy spike I sensed yesterday was indeed his ki blast. Soun Tendo called last night and told me. Son in law had been at school and after the ki blast, he left for town where he met up with the eldest Tendo girl and her date. They had apparently spent the rest of the evening roaming about and eating at a restaurant."<p>"Great grand mother know why we no find airen yesterday?" Shampoo asked, playing with her hair. She really wanted to see him, but just couldn't find him yesterday.<p>Cologne frowned. She had absolutely no idea. Even Happosai was helping  Cologne look for Ranma before he had gotten bored and started chasing women again.<p>He seemed to have somehow been caught up with and was grudgingly pulverized by horde of infuriated women, growing in number as many bystanders recognized who the old man was.<p>" Tokyo is a HUGE city, you stupid little girl! Look at a map and learn something. We did search the city, but even we could have easily missed them. There could have been many places they would have been. Even in an organized search, which last night was anything but, there were substantial chances that we could not have found him. Nothing to worry about. I would dare to assume that he was quite exhausted after the exertion to have much ki left so that I could not sense him."<p>Though the whole story was not known by them, it was lucky twist of fate that Ranma had decided to send that ki blast its way.<p>Had he not, and Cologne had tried to find him for whatever reason, there always seemed to be some spare reasons lying about, suspicions would have arisen as to why he could not be found.<p>Ranma was lucky indeed.<p>Cologne realized that she had been cut off by the momentary question and decided to continue her lecture. The girl needed to understand.<br/>"Back to what saying. Only very potent magic or drug would be able to affect son-in-law. The drawback would be that, because son-in-law has a fighting nature, his spirit would fight the effects till the end. Either the effects would wear off, or the spirit would be broken. Either way we would be at a loss. Should the spirit break, he would turn into a mindless fool. I am not sure you want to have a husband who could not think at all."<br/>Shampoo violently shook her head in response to that prospect.<p>"So do you understand now?"<p>"Yes great grand mother, Shampoo understand." She seemed a little deflated at the work she had to do. It would take even more time, but was inwardly happy now that she had a plan that looked like it had a much better chance at succeeding.<p>"Good, now go serve the customers... they seem to be getting impatient."<p>Shampoo happily jumped around and went to the customers who had been getting a little annoyed at the lack of service. They were relatively happy though, because no fights were taking place today, as they usually did in this restaurant.<p>Cologne smiled at the bouncy form of her great grand daughter. Shampoo  may have been raised as an Amazon to treat males in a certain fashion, but she did  love her airen in her own way. Which ever way she utilized to get his attention was not so much an issue because she really did her best.<p>The Epitome of Irony.<p>The fates had already made their twist as Cologne's plan pitifully had no meaning at all before coming into play. Ranma had already crossed his threshold, only to be brought back to sanity by the tenderness of Kasumi and the impervious spiritual strength of Koryu. Still, should the fates decide to play again, things could go either way.<p>After all , in this world, all was fair in love and war.<p>"SHAMPOOO! Shampoo where are you? Help me!" came a muffled voice from inside the back room.<p>"Shut up boy! You will take your punishment silently." Cologne felt a headache developing.<p>"What kind of punishment is this? Chaining me to a statue with no weapons at all in the store room!" cried an indignant, not quite as blind as a bat, but close enough Mousse.<p>"If I remember correctly, that is the same statue that you had assumed was son-in-law last evening and had attacked it sputtering nonsense about him taking Shampoo's attention from you. You damaged the product, and we had to purchase it. You will stay there like that and take your punishment. I will have Shampoo come and put your gag back on when she's free to help keep you quiet."<p>The cries of 'camel breath','dried up mummy' and such did not cease, so Cologne decided to take another approach.<p>"Shampoo, what do you think about adding Roast Duck to our menu." she said rather loudly.<p>"Oh great grand mother, that brilliant idea! Many customers here ask for that already and Shampoo had to say no. Can Shampoo kill?" replied Shampoo from the table she was waiting on.<p>The cries stopped.<p>Cologne smiled, hopping away on her stick to the next task at hand.<p>Back at the Tendo home, Kasumi Tendo, the eldest of the three sisters had just completed sweeping the front yard of the house after doing the dishes. She reminded herself that she to do the wash as well.<p>Usually when she went about her chores, her mind was always on a book or some magazine she had read, something to that effect. On the other hand, whenever she was troubled, she spent almost her whole day thinking, assiduously analyzing her predicament.<p>This morning happened to be one of those days. Nabiki had decided to pay her a visit early morning when she was in the kitchen. She knew something was wrong when Nabiki had arrived, walking like a mummy, in the kitchen when breakfast was only in preparation.<p>It was as she suspected, Nabiki was aspiring for a better explanation for last night's events. Either that or the real set of events that had took place. The funny thing was, what Kasumi had told her was the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<p>Well... almost.<p>She simply could not bring herself to tell her younger sister regarding Koryu and his background. She felt that she would be betraying Koryu. He had done nothing but be kind to them.<p>Well, he had been occasionally annoying but that was what Kasumi identified as him trying to get some of her buried emotions out in the open, or at least push them around a little until they came out of the deep and into the shallow regions of her behavior.<p>She understood that Nabiki was finding it quite difficult to believe that someone had offhandedly lent that much money to Ranma. It was true nonetheless. Even Kasumi found it quite thorny to believe.<p>She had wanted to ascertain that Nabiki would be mollified enough by her explanation and not be inclined to probe further into the matter.<p>In the end, it had to come back to the trusty old guilt trip.<p>"Nabiki, do you really distrust me that much? Do you think that I would lie to you? If so, please give me one example of my behavior in these great many years that would lead you to believe that I would do anything to bring shame or sadness to this family." she had said with a slightly tremulous face.<p>It worked like a charm.<p>Nabiki had to be consoled by a warm hug after that act. Maybe she had been a little too hard on her. But then again she supposed it could be considered a little homely disciplining for some of the 'business opportunities' Nabiki had employed.<p>After all, Kasumi did not lie. She had told a small fib.<br/>The meaning's may be very similar, but the words were different.<p>After the house had been dusted and all the rooms had been cleaned Kasumi went to her room to dress up a bit.<p>Last night Kasumi had done quite a bit of thinking in her room. She had already decided to go about things in another way since day before yesterday night. But this time she wanted take Ranma's advice and try behaving normally in front of Dr Tofu. Ranma would be happy. She believed he would be delighted to know that someone took his advice.<p>It was hard. She was quite reluctant, being uncomfortable about the consequences that would arise from her sudden change of behavior. It had worked out when she was in high school, but that was because she had always kept it away from home. She didn't want to give a bad impression to her sisters, nor did she want to upset her father.<p>Ah, those days.<p>Kasumi sat down on her bed and quietly decided to relish the memories of the days when she could be free do what she felt like. She didn't want to put it like that, but last night had made her realize what she had been missing out on.<p>During high school, she had a few good friends whith whom she'd love to spend time with. They chattered like girls, stared at good looking guys, and even talked about girl stuff that was quite common at the time. It probably still was.<p>Kasumi had a reluctance to trust someone who was good looking. This was because she had learned from the experience of others.<p>In her eyes, if someone knew they were good looking, they at times chose to use it to a their advantage. Whether it was to impress a girl or a guy, or to help in some other way.<p>She, even if people thought it was naive, always believed in the inner beauty of the heart. It was something she remembered her dear late mother always saying. It's also what she had said when Kasumi had asked her about why she loved her father.<p>Kasumi now had a hard time figuring out what her mother really liked about her father's inner beauty. She had much time trying to find good things about people and trying to ignore their weak points.<p>Apparently she wasn't her mother,she couldn't see what she did. Perhaps the inner beauty might have existed only when mother was alive. Maybe that part of her father had died along with her mother. She would never know.<p>Deciding not to follow her mother's path in a straight line, Kasumi had had her fun later on in high school. She talked with boys and was quite good at hiding her emotions as well as eliciting them.<p>She even went as far as trying to learn how to act 'sexy' from one of her friends. She had gone to Hayate's house and played dress up for the whole of a Saturday.<p>It was fun, she learned to change her behavior appropriately to make herself look nicer and make the guys drool. She had enjoyed herself so much that she went as far as learning to walk in a glamorous manner, learning the subtleties in her movements that supposedly made guys week in the knees.<p>It had been a very enjoyable day.<p>She came back home, the house was in such a mess that she had decided not to ever do that again. Akane had taken it upon herself to try her first hand at cooking.<p>If Ranma thought Akane was bad now, he would be eternally grateful to god, should he know what he would have been forced to eat, if he had tried Akane's first dish.<p>Kasumi had called the hazardous waste disposal team and purchase was given no other choice but to purchase many new kitchen utencils.<p>The entire kitchen needed to be disinfected.<p>Yes, it was that bad.<p>After that disaster, when Kasumi had explained her situation to Hayate, she had come up with an idea to give her training sessions in the school. She had a lot of fun learning from Hayate, and she was able to keep it a secret from everyone but one. Nabiki.<p>Kasumi assumed Nabiki would have found out anyways, so it was better to tell her first hand. She made Nabiki promise to stay quiet about it. This had been a very important thing for Kasumi. She had something that she enjoyed personally and according to Hayate, was a natural.<p>The sessions had taken place in empty classrooms during lunch times, or on the roof of main school building. After she became more confident in herself, Hayate had convinced her to try those moves onto the boys in her class. She had already learned the art of make up from Hayate.<p>Kasumi's initial attempts at flirting worked so well that it surprised her. After that, it had become a usual way for her to treat guys that she thought were nice. She had become to like jokes, and enjoyed fooling around, flirting with boys.<p>She did manage to keep line between flirting and going too far, but apparently the boys did not take a hint. This, she realized after a talk with some of her friends, was usually the case.   So, to keep them at bay, Kasumi had decided to practice a little of the martial arts. She had remembered quite a few moves before she was pretty much forced to take care of the whole family which, added to the school work and ended up leaving her with very little personal time.<p>She had managed to get a few kata's in early morning and also sometimes during lunch along with her 'sexy behavior ' training. This had helped her slowly become into a person who was kind, generous and enjoyed flirting. When guys did not know the limits, she had become quite adept at showing them where they lay.<p>Even the young boy, Kuno didn't have the guts to try and cross the line with her, no matter how good he thought he was with that stick of his.<p>Kasumi remembered some of the boys of her class. They were quite taken with her. She supposed they really liked the sweet, kind, homely persona that she had built around herself. At the same time, she had become quite alluring, which evidently made the guys want her more.<p>She was the mother figure, her sisters looked up to her and respected her. So she had to maintain the line and never let anything of this sort reach the boundaries her home. Well, she did take care of the whole family. So it was something she had to do.<p>At home she had to moderate her behavior because of her father. He wasn't mean but he would be a little strict when it came to her behavior.<p>She never brought her friends home because she was   frightened of what her father would have thought of them. This   might have been paranoia on her part she hadn't wanted to   take any chances<p>Kasumi enjoyed that life. She enjoyed being with her friends, and some of the boys who had learned and in fact became good friends with her as well. The whole year passed and she totally enjoyed herself at her Miyuki-sempai's graduation party. It was, well, a blast!<p>She then entered to the senior year in high school and soon had became known as the Kasumi Tendo of Furinkan High. No guy had ever taken her out on a date.   Now that she thought about it, Kasumi felt that maybe it was her fault. She had been far too busy in trying to find the inner beauty in guys. In the end she had justd rejected a lot of people.<p>Eventually, Kasumi thought that the boys at school would ask her out simply because they decided that she was a prize. The winner would be the one that she went out on a date with.<p>Honestly. Some guys really did not know about a woman's heart at all.<p>Kasumi giggled.<p>Well, Ranma didn't even know the alphabet when it came to that, but he was learning really fast. At least he was honorable.<p>Well, that was how the senior year went pretty much until the senior year dance.<p>The senior year dance was something that was considered a must for the seniors to all attend. Hayate had very forcefully, in a kind way, told Kasumi to go. She did not accept any kind of answer that Kasumi tried to provide.<p>Reluctantly, Kasumi had agreed and they they went to several malls in order to find a good dress for Kasumi to wear. The dress she had ended up purchasing was in fact the same one she wore last Saturday.<p>That night, when she had prepared herself and was ready, Hayate had come to her house to pick her up. This had been a mistake.<p>Kasumi had somehow convinced her father that there was a large gathering for the seniors in the school that evening and even Nabiki had helped convince her father to let her go, for a price of fifty yen. She had given her dear elder sister a discount.<p>When Hayate and a couple of other friends had arrived at her house, her father had been upset at the type of clothes that they were wearing. He had openly told them that he would not allow his daughter to go to a gathering where girls would wear that sort of gear and assorted with boys.<p>Akane had been there, so maybe that was where her detest for boys had initiated. Kasumi had heard everything from her room. She knew something wrong might happen, causing her father to not allow it.<p>She had very quickly changed her clothes and came down to apologize to her friends, telling them that she could not go. Her father was right there with her, nodding in agreement.<p>She had promptly ignored his question about what kind of friends she had come to have in her senior year. Kasumi felt that he had no right to judge them.<p>They were very nice people, and had been very caring. They were her friends that she talked to on occasion. They were friends that had helped her into a more open life, and enjoy her self a bit.<p>That night was the first time Kasumi had the urge to reply back to her father about some of the things he believed about honor and the right of things. He himself did nothing all day long. She had to maintain the whole house hold. What kind of father did that?<p>However, she managed to keep her anger and frustration inside, once more. She did so because her mother had loved her father. She also did, because he was very caring. Nonetheless, this was something that had always feel slightly irritated about her father's thoughts and outdated tradition.<p>Later on she had heard the dance had been great. Initially she had been reluctant, but that night she had really been looking forward to the dance.<p>Nabiki had offered to give back the fifty yen but Kasumi hadn't wanted it. She had given Nabiki a look and told her that she should be careful with her clients. She had fulfilled her contractual obligations in helping convince father initially to let her go. If, because of her friends, her father had changed his mind, it was not her fault.<p>How he had let her wear the bikini at prince Toma's island was still left her mind blank. Maybe he already knew who was there and didn't mind. She didn't want to think about that experience. Her father's actions were something that she didn't want to try and understand.<p>Apparently Nabiki had really learned from that. Well, something good had happened from that experience at least.<p>Kasumi didn't remember anything too significant happening for the rest of the year except the graduation. Hayate had decided to go study engineering. She had even gotten into Tokyo University no less.<p>Kasumi didn't go to university but liked medicine. She used to borrow books to read in her rare free time from the local Doctor, Dr Tofu.<p>She had initially been really impressed at his reaction towards her. She thought it was really cute. He had also been a very kind man, still is, and took care of Akane whenever she got hurt.<p>It was interesting to watch Akane develop a crush on the kind Doctor. Kasumi found him quite attractive, and she thought she had really found the inner beauty she wanted to find in him.<p>Assuming that the reaction he had towards would go away, she waited and kept on borrowing books in hope that if he got used to seeing her, he would grow out of it.<p>That had yet to happen.<p>After Kasumi's graduation, Akane had started having problems with the boys at Furinkan High. Akane just did what she thought was right. She fought back.<p>Kasumi had tried to tell Akane that there were better ways to help the situation out, but she had said that she didn't want her help at all. Kasumi assumed that she was jealous because Dr. Tofu hadn't paid her much attention. He treated her like a child and always went into that strange behavior when Kasumi was around.<p>When she tried again, telling her that there were other ways to deal with boys that didn't know how to talk to a girl, and offered to share some of her experience, Akane had said that she knew nothing about martial arts and that she knew nothing of pride.<p>Because that was said so angrily and vehemently, Kasumi was about to scold her but her father had interjected saying that Akane was right. His tone of voice was also quite harsh. Ever since, Kasumi had been a little scared of her father and sister.<p>It was then that she decided to hold back the personality that she become to own, and try and help Akane by leading as good an example that she could give.<p>It had never worked, but Kasumi had done her best.<p>Akane's situation had gotten worse and while Kasumi had talked to her friend Hayate, occasionally, it had become quite rare. The only person she talked to on a weekly basis was Nabiki. That was also a problem because Nabiki had become had developed a personality never really showed any emotion.<p>Nabiki had learned too well and while Kasumi played around with people and friends, Nabiki had decided that money was where her happiness lay.<p>That lead up to when Ranma had entered their lives and well, the rest obviously followed.<p>Her frustrations had also apparently reached their peak at Dr Tofu's continuous reaction to her and his attitude's deteriorating nature.<p>She supposed she was just as much crying her heart out as Ranma was the day before, but now was the time for action. She wanted to break free from the restriction that her dear father had imposed on her. She had to live her life, or at least to try.<p>Thinking about her past for her past for the last forty five minutes, Kasumi had come to realize just how important Ranma's friend ship was to her right now. They were in the same position. He desperately needed someone to hold on to whom wouldn't try and take an advantage of the situation. He needed someone who would talk to him impartially and hold him when he needed so.<p>She was also in the same position. She hadn't had that close a friend for a long time. She felt that her family's requirements and her personal sentiments were tearing her up from the inside. Last night, when Ranma had held her, he had hugged her so protectively. She loved the feeling feeling she received. It felt so strong that she really would have almost instantly fallen asleep.<p>She needed him to help keep her sanity just as much as he needed her. She was trying so hard to maintain the family and it was becoming increasingly difficult. The revival of her past emotions on occasion was not helping any.<p>She need to let her frustrations out on to someone. Maybe she would talk to Ranma about more of her past. She told him quite a bit already and she thought he had willingly believed her.<p>Kasumi thought about last night, after they at left the resturant.<p>Oh, Ranma. Whatever he felt could just as well be pasted on his forehead. His emotions were so easily readable. She knew he loved his time that he spent with her. He told her so and asked her to do something like that again.<p>She knew without doubt that he was not faking his emotions yesterday; all she could do is to jump into his arms and hold him as tight as she possibly could.<p>She tried not to cry. She didn't want Ranma worried. It was a good thing that he had decided to walk over to Koryu and bow.<p>That had given her time to wipe away her tears.<p>She couldn't shake the feeling that Koryu had seen that, even if he didn't say anything in response. Whatever happened, Kasumi just felt like going back into Ranma's arms again.<br/>Kasumi sighed. It was difficult to not drag Ranma off into her bedroom, so she closed the door on his face. She felt guilty about her actions, and she wanted to talk to him and tell him everything about her past. She knew he would understand. After about twenty minutes of indecision, she decided to go back to him and tell him everything. She found him asleep on the floor.<p>She set up his futon an dragged him onto it, giving him a nice long goodnight kiss on the cheek. Oh, how she wanted to lay down next to him. She had found something so appealing about the aura that Ranma had. She didn't know if it was his inner beauty or just his protective battle aura.<br/>She sat next to him, wondering about it for a moment, and then decided it was his aura. With that, she went back to her room to sleep.<br/>He was a friend, she could forget that he was absolutely gorgeous, and she knew he would willingly do almost anything for her. She had helped him recover from one of his life's biggest crises, and he had helped her recover from hers.<p>Koryu was a big part of it, she supposed.<p>Did that man read so deep into her? No. He just assumed several things and as he had said, apparently the fates decided to be kind to us for once. Koryu had sworn on his honor. After what he had done for Ranma and Kasumi, she would never doubt his honor.<p>Kasumi stopped thinking and looked at her watch, it was 2 PM. She decided that it would be a good idea to agree to Ranma's request and carry out her life. It would go no where if she did not move with the time.<p>Kasumi had finally realized that Time and Life, though essentially two different things, had to keep on moving at the same pace. In her case if the life moved too slowly, the time pass by. If life moved to fast, as in the case of Ranma, life would self destruct.<p>Time could not be stopped so the life had to keep on moving.<p>Lately, Kasumi's life was almost at a stand still.<p>It had to begin moving again with the time. Ranma would help her do so. Of that, she was certain. He had already helped convince her to do what she was going for today.<br/>Ranma's life had kept on moving too fast. He needed to slow down and rest before moving on again, a little slower than before. She promised herself that she would help give that to him, no matter what.<p>She would comfort him in her arms much as he needed, and he would do the same for her. She just new. A strange bond that they had formed, Ranma and Kasumi. A few days ago, she would have never thought this would be happening.<p>She was happy it happened though. She couldn't be happier.<br/>'Its time to move Kasumi. Dr Tofu's waiting' she said to herself as she got up from her bed finally to dress up a little.<p>She wore her usual dress, god forbid anything even slightly revealing.<p>Dear Betty-Chan would provide a more useful conversation than the good Doctor would be able to.<p>After appropriately dressing up, she came downstairs to ask her father a question that had been nagging her mind.<p>"Father, could you tell me where Mr Saotome is and if  he would be coming today? I have to cook appropriately you know,<br/>and he does have a very healthy appetite." she asked<p>Soun was sitting where he usually parked while playing shogi with Genma. Currently he was reading the news paper. What he actually read or found interesting was a mystery even to Kasumi.<p>Even news paper publishing company employees would never sit there and stare through a news paper for that long.<p>"Ah... Kasumi. I believe he's gone to take care of some business."<p>"Oh my! Thats wonderful. What kind of business does he have?"<p>Soun started to sweat. This was Kasumi. The sweet, loving, caring Kasumi.<p>"He met an old friend a few days ago. That man had kindly invited  him to visit his Dojo and check it out. He will be gone for a few days"<p>"How wonderful. Why didn't you go?"<p>"Oh, how could I leave my children like this?" said Soun as if he was the most caring father in the world. He cried a lot for his children but that didn't mean he had cared a lot for them. Truly cared that is.<p>"Is that so? Why thank you father. That was so thoughtful of you." said Kasumi in her usual im-so-happy-cheshire-cat-couldn't-beat-me manner.<p>Soun smiled back and hid his face behind the news paper again. He had begun sweating. This was the first time he had ever lied to his eldest daughter in the face. Oh how would his dear, dear wife react.<p>He imagined himself being tied up to a wheel of a car, being raced down a road of nails, struck down by a truck, attached to a city grid transformer, run through a pencil sharpner, the shavings being used to make a cherry bomb that would be shoved down the master's pants and left out in the desert so the vultures would eat the remains.<p>Kasumi went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. The morning work tended to get a little tedious and she felt a little parched. When she came back she told Soun that she was going to go to Dr Tofu's and possibly ask him out to lunch.<p>Soun's reply was expected, if quite bothersome.<br/>"Kasumi, yesterday night you were out late with some man I don't even know and now you are daring to ask the good Doctor out for lunch? What brought this out in you?"<p>"Father, I just wanted have a talk with him regarding a few books that I have read, borrowed from him, and ask for any thought he might want to add to mine about them." Kasumi glibly replied. She had a couple of books in her hand, luckily picked up from her shelf in her room.<p>They really had been borrowed from the Doctor currently suffering from the Kasumi-induced-blabbering-complex. She hadn't been popular in high school just because she was a flirt and good looking. She was smart as well.<p>"Couldn't you do that at the clinic itself?" Soun enquired.<p>"It would be more fun that way father. I think it would be enjoyable to go out. I tend not to get out that often."<p>"Kasumi, Kasumi, what would your dear mother say about this?"<p>Oops.<p>Kasumi's back went rigid as she clenched her hands tightly, her face becoming hardened as she quickly thought up a reply.<p>"Father, I think my mother would be very pleased to know the fact that I am still trying to have some sort of a life a girl my age should and not spending my entire time doing what is becoming of an unmarried house wife."<p>Kasumi had said that in an even tone. She had not raised, not lowered her voice, nor had she added any pressure to it. Still. It was not said in her usual cheery, sunny, sweet voice.<p>After that rare display of such emotion in front of her father, Kasumi quickly walked out of the house. She just went straight past the gate and towards Dr Tofu's clinic, holding the two books across her ample chest.<p>"I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that. "<p>Her record had apparently gotten stuck. Fortunately it had cleared  up a little bit to move on to the next track<p>"What was I thinking? What was I thinking? What was I thinking? What was I thinking? What was I thinking? What was I thinking? What was I thinking?"<p>And so onwards went her rather short journey to the Dr Ono Tofu's clinic.<p>By the time she reached there, Kasumi had visibly relaxed. While she had never said something like that to her father before, he had never questioned her behavior before either. Well once, but she had bit back her reply back then.<p>It was obvious that some changes were in order. She had taken Ranma's advice and decided to visit Dr. Tofu and take some sort of real action towards the man and see if things could actually go further than it had originally seemed.<p>She went into the clinic upon reaching it and as expected the patients that were waiting in queue, started to grumble and rapidly evacuated out of the clinic.<p>Soon a patient that was currently visiting the office came out of the examination room with Doctor Tofu tailing him.<p>"So, all I got to do is take these three times a day right?"<p>"Yes, and please try to rest as much as possible. It does tend to increase the healing rate."<p>The patient turned around and recognized Kasumi, and thanked his lucky stars that he was already on his way out and safe from any torture Dr Tofu could perform on him. That would have unintentionally happened had he seen or heard Kasumi while they were in the examination room.<p>He quickly left the premises. You never knew with the good Doctor.<p>Dr Tofu was a little busy wiping his sweaty hands clean when he saw Kasumi.<p>"Ka-ka-ka Kasumi, how nice to see you."<p>The tell tale signs of his complex had started to show. His mouth was twitching and his body started jerk. His glasses became foggy and his arms restless. She sometimes wondered if he could actually do anything to please a girl with those hands. She thought he could, he was a Doctor and knew the human anatomy.<p>That thought quickly left her mind as she sighed. She just couldn't make her think like that for long. It wasn't in her personality. She knew many girls were a little perverted at least. Maybe she hadn't met Mr Right yet.<p>She then remembered Ranma and how he had looked yesterday night. How he had held her. His arms were so protective and warm. She really would have almost instantly fallen asleep had she not heard Koryu-chan's voice. She half wanted to as well.<p>HA!.. what was she thinking. God she had to get her mind off the physical attraction. She and Ranma had become friends, albeit very close ones.<p>He needed to trust her and she needed to trust him. If she harbored such emotions toward him, it would hinder the kind of deep and absolutely trusting relationship that had seemed to form between them in the last day and a half. Of course, if he harbored the same feelings towards her things could be different. Sure, she teased him a little bit and he willingly played along with her. He wanted to make her feel free and not restricted. He was letting her share a bit of herself with him as he would share a bit of himself with her.<p>But wasn't that what people in a deep, loving relation ship did. She was sure she read that in a book somewhere.<p>Confused with the onset of emotions, Kasumi, took in a deep breath sharply, plopped the books on a chair beside her, walked over to Dr. Tofu still dithering about and slapped him with both hands on both cheeks.<p>She held her hands there and guided his face towards hers. "Ono Tofu, I am here to ask you out for lunch. Since everyone except possibly you knows of this complex when I arrive, they have all positively left and will not be returning for the rest of the day." She spoke out loudly.<p>"I am standing right here, right now. Make your decision Ono, I will not hold my breath. I will leave and I will never see you again. I have been hurt enough by your lack of common sense when you are around me. A girl's feelings are NOT to be trifled with."<p>Now she really felt that she was returning to the old Kasumi of Furinkan High. When she saw that this had little effect, Kasumi decided to implement counter measure one.<p>She promptly did him in. Dr Tofu, if possible in his current condition, was quivering with pain as he just saw Kasumi knee him where males, to a very large extent, abhorred getting injured.<p>"Come on be a man, I have seen Ranma take 10 times more damage and walk away from it as it was nothing. I didn't even hit you that hard, considering that if we did manage to work out and get hooked up, I would like to have children some day." Kasumi spoke in a loud, confident voice.<p>It was the same voice she had used all yesterday evening with Ranma. She had started to use it with Koryu, but didn't really have too much of a chance. He was constantly annoying her.<p>Now that she thought of it, if he wasn't so busy teasing her, he would have succeeded in getting a rise out of her by giving her a chance.<p>But then again, after her initial treatment of him, she assumed that Koryu was in fact, very intelligent and somehow kept things from going in the direction where he would have to get physically hurt.<p>Not that she was violent. She was just more, persuasive. She knew what to hit when to get the maximum out of it. Nabiki had learned this ability from her and used it to make money.<p>Kasumi had always been a simple typical kind of girl.<br/>Brought back to her current situation by Dr Tofu's unusual high pitched voice, Kasumi decided it was time for counter measure two. Things were working, it's just that she needed to get across to him a lot faster than he was currently willing to go.<p>She dragged him by the ear to a chair, forced him to sit down and looked straight at him.<p>Kasumi was glaring. She was really giving an angry glare! Oh it was a long time since she'd done that.<p>The poor guy whom she'd given that glare back in the days kept out of her sight for at least a week after. She couldn't remember his name, not that it mattered.<p>"Yes or No! Please give me your answer now."<br/>Kasumi's look became a little soft. She was hurting.<p>"I-I-I'm sorry Ka-Kasumi. This is my fault. I should be able to do this. Y-Yes, I would love to take you ... out to lunch. Please wait until I get my stuff from my room." Dr Tofu managed, stuttering along the way but it was better than his previous attempts.<p>'Thank GOD! Things might finally turn out better after all! Thank you Ranma!' Kasumi silently thanked the pig tailed martial artist.<p>They went out of the clinic after Dr Tofu collected his coat and Kasumi picked up her books. She had to be prepared anyways.   If he locked up again, maybe she would smack him around with a couple of books. Well, truly she wanted to talk to him about the books as well incase her father had decided to talk to Dr Tofu and check up on things.<p>The chances of him doing that were very slim, but still, it was quite a possibility and she had to be prepared.<p>"So... ummm ...er... wh-where would you like to go for lunch?" asked Ono Tofu sluggishly.<p>Kasumi thought quickly. She had to do something, she had to think of a good place where they could have fun and be least problematic. A place that would be safe enough and obviously a place that served good food.<p>For the first time in several years, Kasumi smiled  Dr Tofu had much of his senses, he would probably start sweating. It did not matter, because he already was.<br/>Induced from the complex, the pores on his skin had an inverse relationship with the physical distance between Dr Tofu and Kasumi.<br/>The closer he got, the more they opened and  vice versa. At the moment, he was sweating like.<br/>well... a pig<p>Kasumi recalled the last time she smiled evilly was with Miyuki Sempai at her graduation party before she headed off to the Police Academy.<p>"I know just the place!"<p>She didn't pay attention to a feeling slowly cropping in the back of her mind for showing Dr Tofu that smile. It said that Ranma had deserved to see that smile first.<p>Shampoo had quickly been going around the customers passing them their food when she saw the most unexpected couple enter.<p>She almost let her tray slip and fall on the floor.<p>The couple found an empty table and sat down. Well, one of them was almost dragged into his  watching them for a couple of minutes, Shampoo decided to go and take their order.<p>"Shampoo surprised to see you two here."<p>"Oh Hi Shampoo. I know, Dr Tofu so kindly agreed to take me out to lunch. We can enjoy lunch as well as talk about these wonderful books he lent me." smiled Kasumi.<p>"What you like to order, wait. Since this first time you two come, it on house. Restaurant been doing really well lately." Shampoo smiled, happy.<p>"Oh no, that would not be appropriate. Its ok, I think Dr Tofu here can pay."<p>"Shampoo insist. Nice girl Kasumi always be polite to Shampoo as well."<p>Well of course. Kasumi was nice to everyone. Shampoo, having her drawbacks, nonetheless was a very nice girl. So looking at that Kasumi always treated the girl with politeness.<p>She chose however, to forget all the times she really felt like ...like... doing something not so nice to Shampoo for all the times she went around creating her own openings to the house.<p>They had both reluctantly agreed to take Shampoo's offer and ordered two Deluxe Ramen Specials. Shampoo quickly ran off to the kitchen to tell Cologne of what she saw.<p>"So... uh... you wanted to talk about these books?" Dr. Tofu started. He was still visibly very nervous. At least he was trying though. That was a good thing.<p>"Yes, partly I did want to talk about a few things that were in them. This book here, is about Chinese herbal medicine and this one.. well we can ignore this one for today."<p>"Chinese herbal medicine, we can also talk to Elder Cologne about this as well. It would be a good way to learn first hand from an Amazon Elder. They had employed use of these, first. That is what a book I once read said anyways." said Dr Tofu.   Dr. Tofu had slowly started talking more sense and was able to keep his weird attitude from taking too much control of him. At least he was paying attention. That was a good sign.<p>Kasumi's plan had worked. She had thought that coming here would have many benefits. Of course, the first being that talking about Chinese medicine with someone other than Kasumi, such as elder Cologne may prove to drive Dr Tofu's complex away or at least keep it at bay during lunch.<p>It also would keep any suspicion of Kasumi having any extra relationship with Ranma even if she did spend a little bit more time with him, or spoke more freely. They would think she was simply opening up a little.<p>God, they had no idea.<p>Lastly, being in an open place, having Cologne there discussing things with them, her father would never doubt anything else apart from what she had told him in the morning. This would most probably settle any pending issues from her outburst earlier on today.<p>The two couple chatted for a bit, well Kasumi talked and Dr Tofu kind of managed to give small sounds that seemed to represent some sort of replies.<p>Soon, when the food arrived, Cologne arrived along with it. Kasumi's first hunch proved right as Dr Tofu was moving along and speaking in proper complete sentences for now. It was getting to be a bit more pleasurable.<br/>They had discussed a few things about different herbal medicine and had gotten some insight from Cologne from her personal experience. It was actually quite an informative talk.<p>Soon, Cologne had to go back because she was the only one in the kitchen. Kasumi had asked where Mousse was and Cologne's reply was "He's contemplating whether he wants to become a roast duck or not."<p>She had left the couple to their own thoughts after that. They somehow had managed to keep an amiable conversation going, even if it was someone restrained.<p>Kasumi found out that Dr. Tofu had traveled quite a bit to different places. He had been to China, and wondered around in Japan. What she did feel disappointed at though was that he had said he was no longer going to travel. There were many things nowadays that could be found on the Internet or through libraries.<p>"Fine," Kasumi thought. Granted she liked reading books, so that had that much in common, but she really wanted to travel a lot, too.<p>The continued their conversation, from little things to others.<p>The time she was spending with Doctor Tofu was nothing compared to the time she had Ranma. Ranma had treated her so well and even responded to her somewhat, sly remarks formidably. He only lacked a few manners.<p>She wanted to give Dr Tofu a fair chance so she stopped comparing the two people. Besides, she did like Dr. Tofu. He was a genuinely nice guy who could be very kind and affectionate. She knew that from how he treated Akane.<p>That was also the reason why Akane had developed  a crush on him. To think that she could hide such a thing  from Kasumi Tendo of Furinkan High was a big mistake. But then again, not to belittle her dearest sister, Akane  was a little slow at times. Okay, most of the time. Alright, it was hard to find a time when she was actually quite intelligent.<p>Why she was doing this in her mind, Kasumi just couldn't fathom. Anyways, this date was going out well. There were many things that could have happened. She was glad that she had not wasted her time, did not waste Ranma's genuine concern and suggestion to have a somewhat open conversation with Dr Tofu.<p>She wondered how happy he would be when she will tell him tonight, what she had done.<p>END OF CHAPTER 6
