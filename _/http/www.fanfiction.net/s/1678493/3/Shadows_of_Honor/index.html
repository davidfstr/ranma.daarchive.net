</div>Chapter 3: A New Day Begins, A New Shadow Made, Honor Redefined.<p>Breakfast was strangely quiet the next day. Akane had decided   to stay in instead of going for a jog. Nabiki walked in looking as if she had just gotten back from a date with dracula.<p>Well, she did seem kind of lifeless. Maybe she just needed some dose of sugar to help get her brain up and working. Strange, since her type of personality would be perfect type to wake up sharp and fresh every morning, looking forward to the day's business.<p>Mr. Panda walked..err crawled in slowly. Kasumi had already prepared some hot water for him so she proceded in pouring some on him eliciting a howl of pain.<br/>Everyone cringed and then looked somewhat pitifully at Genma now who was very, very red.<p>"Oh. I'm so terribly sorry, was that too hot?"<p>Kasumi put a hand to her mouth, giving a look that would make the devil shy away from her innocence.<p>"Nooo...its quite alright Kasumi... I'm sure it wasn't on purpose." said Genma. Though in the back of his mind he was wondering just how hot that water had gotten. It was past boiling.<p>'Yes it was. I put in quite a bit of salt.' Kasumi thought to herself as she went to sat back down and put some rice into her bowl. A quick glance at Akane had told her everything she wanted to know about the youngest Tendo.<p>God she could be so difficult some times. She still believes the word revolves around her. Granted no one had ever tried to prove it to her, but she should still have been able to realize it after all the ordeals they had all gone through. Such a sweet girl but just so possessive! Even after her serious flaws, Ranma still wanted to salvage things between them.<p>Well then again, Ranma was always too good for his own good. It wasn't like he was he was perfect either. But Kasumi liked to believe his pros far outweighed the cons.<p>Kasumi stopped musing to herself as the person she was thinking about walked into the room and sat down next to Akane. She raised an eyebrow at that, maybe Ranma was going to try again with Akane.<p>'He should!', she told herself. In all honesty, watching Akane being pressured as well, put much strain on the elder sister. She cared deeply for her family, especially for her dearest sisters.<p>"Where have you been boy? Why didn't you spar with me this morning?" asked Genma indignantly.<p>"We did pop, you were just wiped out before I even got warmed up. Maybe you hit your head too hard to remember that." replied Ranma with a curious look on his face.<br/>Annoyance? No... it looked like amusement but after the recent events of the morning, Kasumi wondered if he wasn't going to jump up and down with joy any time soon.<p>He just found out that he hadn't killed Saffron, and it had brought out such a change in him. In reality that was what was really bothering him, much more than the other problems. He needed time to recover and he was not given any. His 'friends' had only made things worse by not considering his state of mind.<p>Suddenly it hit her. It all made sense now.<p>Honor<p>All his life he was taught that honor was the most important thing a man could have. Whatever happened, he had always tried to maintain honor, like it was his life line. That was why he was so depressed!<p>Things had a way of not going towards the way the martial artist had planned. No matter what happened he had managed to keep his honor. It was his fall back point. If things got out of hand, he could at least go back to his core belief that he was honorable.<p>Lately that core was almost shattered. No matter how much he tried to tell himself, he simply could not force his mind to accept the fact that killing someone, for whatever reasons, is honorable.<p>He could not lie to himself about something that defined who he was at heart when his heart was screaming at him that what he did was not honorable.<p>Taking a king away from his people. Saffron had people he cared about as well. People cared for him as well.<p>Kasumi was sure this was what went on in  the back of his mind<p>This was the core difference between Genma and his son. Though, unfortunately no matter how much anger she may feel at Genma, she had to accept the fact that he did manage to do what he promised to his wife.<p>Ranma truly had become a man among men. It was at great risk though. A risk to his sanity, a risk to his very existence many times over.<br/>Maybe Ranma would have slowly recovered, with her help if Koryu hadn't arrived and helped him remove his mental blocks.<p>Maybe not.<p>No one would ever know.<p>Kasumi was brought out of her thoughts when she heard Mr. Honor sniffle. That was more like it.<p>"You coming up with a cold Ranma? Maybe you should head over to Dr. Tofu to see if you can get it checked out."<p>Ranma smiled at that. She truly was quick. He hadn't thought of how he would explain that sniffle to anyone.<p>"If you ask me... he looks like he just came after a good cry." said Nabiki drolly. For being half asleep she was still quite observant.<p>"Is that true son?" asked Soun, deciding to join in. Ranma surely looked like he just recovered from a cry.<p>There was no reply apart from the general shrug of shoulders. Ranma didn't seem to bothered though. He just leisurely took the bowl of rice in front of him and slowly started eating.<p>"Answer boy! Real men do not cry. How dare you shame me!"<p>"Oh my!" exclaimed Kasumi, holding her chopsticks in her mouth as she had just swallowed a mouthful of food.<p>"Father, are you not a real man?" she asked innocently, looking at him with big eyes.<p>Soun and Genma were stunned into silence.<p>"Ah.. why do you ask that Kasumi?" beads of sweat had already formed on Soun's forehead.<p>"Well, you have been doing little else except crying for the past so many years father." she replied.<p>"Ah well Kasumi this is a little diff-." Soun had started only to be cut off as she continued her sweet innocent act.<p>"And Mr Saotome, you have been doing a lot of crying your self. You cried when you were served some burned food by your wife, when you were a panda. Also, you cry when your old master comes around."<p>The inquisitive look she gave deflated any sort of rise Soun had coming but Genma tried to keep at it.<p>"Dear Kasumi, we only weep at the loss of what  could be.-"<p>"Still doesn't explain anything. You still cry, but of course you don't fall under the rules of men. My oppology."<p>Everyone looked at the source of that voice, a smooth, delicate but strong voice oozing with sarcasm.<p>Even Kasumi was stunned for a second.<p>Nabiki had joined in.<p>Ranma inwardly wanted to dance. 'Wow, things might just start to be going my way again!'<p>Genma and Soun, not wanting the wrath of Nabiki adding on to the strangely dangerous innocence of Kasumi, chose the best course of action in the current situation.   As hilarious as it may sound, it was probably the most well made decision they had come apon in a long while.<br/>They shut up.<br/>Not much had happened after that as breakfast was finished. Soun and Genma seemed to have walked off to a corner as they noticed Ranma and Akane had not gotten into an argument this morning.<br/>"This is going to work! All we have to do is keep it secret from everyone. No one will suspect a thing!" Soun said excitedly to Genma who nodded furiously.<br/>From behind them Ranma looked at them with a bored expression. "I'll bet you a million yen that I know what they're planning."<br/>"Bad idea Ranma. Don't bet money you don't have." said Nabiki who still had a slightly sleepy look on her face.<p>"Afraid I'll win?" Ranma smiled again, confident.<br/>Kasumi sighed. It was THAT smile again.<br/>"I guess I'll take things into the kitchen." she said as she gathered the dishes lying on the table.<br/>If Nabiki noticed anything, she didn't show it. She gingerly looked at Ranma with a vicious predatory smile.<p>"Ranma, Ranma, what is the point in making a bet that has no risks? I, however will bet you that you have no idea how they're planning to execute whatever is cooking up in their minds" she replied.<p>Ranma sat there, wondering. Realization struck home when he recalled what Koryu had told him earlier.<p>"How much?" he said confidently.<p>That got Nabiki off guard. It shook her out her sleepy stupor as she looked him straight in the eye. Wondering what he could possibly be hiding to give him that kind of confidence.<p>He usually wasn't this confident when he was dealing with her for obvious reasons.<p>She couldn't come up with anything at all. She was about to take the bet, just to see what Ranma was up to... maybe it was even worth loosing a few yen if he pulled a miracle and won the bet. She was about to reply when Akane spoke up, interrupting the two.<p>"Ranma you know better than to make bets with Nabiki. You know your going to lose." Akane retorted, apparently still a little peeved but still having a relaxed look on her face.<p>Ranma bit back a reply when he decided to go through   another way. "What's the matter, don't trust me?" he asked<p>"What have you done to prove to me that I should?" Akane said quietly. "I thought you would have changed. But you still are the same pervert at heart." she continued.<p>"How about the fact that Ranma killed Saffron for you." came Kasumi's voice from the kitchen.<p>Akane remained quiet at that. "Yea.. you did didn't you?"<br/>She smile a bit. "But why do you then flirt with all those bimbo's"<p>Nabiki looked questioningly at towards the kitchen for a moment as she got a sudden feeling that others might just decide to show up. Another fight might be begin .   She languidly got up and went inside the kitchen.   Maybe it was time for another 'talk' with her elder sister.<p>"Who are ya callin a bimbo sugar?" came a growl from the koi pond. Everyone turned around to see Ukyo walking towards the house with a look of determination and anger.<p>"Akane... she kissed me on the cheek. And I didn't do anything back. Are you always going to get miffed at each and every single thing that you don't like and blame me for it?" Ranma asked gently, ignoring Ukyo's presence completely.<p>Ukyo seemed undaunted as she reached the house. "She is to violent prone and doesn't think anything through. Always jumping to conclusions is the only thing she really does best."<br/>"Yea, you're right about that Uchhan. Only she has a knack for jumping to the wrong ones, never the right ones." Ranma replied. "I am not a pervert Akane. I may not be perfect, and I may have a lot of flaws but I chose you, and I fought for you. Don't ya think I deserve some slack? Lay off my back for a while will ya? Can't get out of your little world and see that I am hurting here as well? Maybe more than you ever could?" He looked towards Akane.<p>"She'll never understand Ranma." Ukyo said as she walked up to Ranma.<p>Akane fumed at that. The jerk was taking Ukyo's side over hers! How dare he?<p>"Give it a rest. Openly adding salt to my wounds doesn't necessarily bring you in my good books either." Said Ranma to Ukyo. This was going the usual way. Why couldn't the morning start off better?<p>Ukyo stopped to look at Ranma, glancing from his left side. Maybe it wasn't a good idea coming here after all. Maybe she needed to give him a little more time. The wedding was ruined. He needed time to re-collect himself. He should realise that Akane wouldn't do him well at all.<br/>"Akane, if you had a best friend who kissed you on the cheek, and I responded in a similar way as you did, gettin all angry... how would you like it?"<p>"I don't have a best friend who is a fiancee!" replied Akane heatedly.<p>Ranma shook his head as he turned around and walked out the house.<br/>"Think about what I said Akane. Most of all, just please let me continue life like normal before you put all your crap on me. Its hard enough as it is knowing that I became a killer for someone who doesn't trust me." he said before he jumped out on the wall and ran off across it. Disappeared from view in the next leap.<p>Not given the time to reply, nor that she was going to any ways, Akane thought about what he said for a second.<p>"Akane" said Ukyo disappointingly. "You never listen to him, do you?"<br/>"I don't need any lecture from you Ukyo!" shouted Akane as she got up and headed straight for the Dojo. She needed to vent some frustrations.<p>"Akane, before you leave..." Kasumi came in the room looking at Akane with... what was it?.. Anger? Kasumi? Angry?<br/>"Before you leave, please think about this. You always vent your anger, mostly on him usually by shouting or some times hitting him. For once, please let Ranma vent his anger out. Treat him as he treats you. He never hit you. And he has on occasions, way too many to count, been extremely kind to you. Its only been a week since you have come back... just let it be for a while and I assure you things will start changing. Alright?"<p>Akane was about to retort when Kasumi intensified the glare she was giving Akane. She visably withered as she slowly turned around and went to the dojo, slumping a little.<p>"Since the object of your affections is not here, I suggest you leave as well Ukyo-chan. If you would like to vent some of your anger, I believe Mr. Saotome were planning another wedding somewhere in the corner of the back yard." Kasumi quickly said. Ukyo's eyes went round as she quickly dashed to the koi pond looking around. "They're not here."<p>"Must have run away. They're good at that."<p>'This was not good. Things could get out of order if the two .<br/>foolish men managed to follow through with another forced wedding. Ranma   would not be happy. Neither would Akane.' thought Kasumi<p>Ukyo disappeared after jumping over the wall in quite a hurry.<p>Nabiki walked into the living room with a cup of lemonade as she turned towards Kasumi with a knowing smile gracing her sharp but elegant features.<p>"Maybe she'll catch them, and slow things down."<p>Kasumi stood there in silence looking at the wall Ukyo had jumped over, mulling over several possibilities in her mind.<p>"It could be possible", " she said while turning around to start cleaning and dusting the house.<p>Looking at the determination in Kasumi's face, Nabiki smiled inwardly and sat down close to the TV and switched it on, clicking on the nearby remote with her toe.<p>"Kasumi Onee Chan finally going to get into the action... is she?" she said dryly.<p>"Its nothing like that Nabiki, but I can't just sit by and watch this all go on any more. I'm going to have to do something!" the look of exasperation of Kasumi's face was definitely a sight that has never been seen before, except by Nabiki when they talked occasionally.<p>Maybe in high school, but after she graduated, their father had gotten her to do mostly house work. She had begun to simply behave as if she didn't know what was going on.<p>Hours passed in the Tendo house hold as Nabiki sat there silently watching  TV while Kasumi cleaned the house. The thought had occurred to Kasumi to maybe let  Nabiki in on what had happened last night and this morning, but she decided against   it for now. She didn't want to keep it a secret from her middle sister, because she  would be a great help when the news finally broke out.<p>But ... maybe later.<p>"Nabiki, I'm going up to my room. If you need anything please call me ok?"<p>"Ok sis, don't break anything.. oh wait.. that is what Akane would do, Sorry!" came the reply.<p>It was almost noon.<p>Kasumi wanted to talk to Koryu. See if he could do anything.<p>As Kasumi reached her door, she took a deep breath and opened it,<br/>slowly peeking inside. Koryu was right there in the corner where she had left  was leaning against the wall, his head drooping down as his hands were folded infront of one knee while the other leg lay stretched infront of him.<p>Apparently, his sword or any of the apparel he was wearing last night apart   from his clothes, were not to be seen in the room.<p>"Umm.. if you would excuse me? Koryu-san?" Kasumi began. Not knowing how to really address him.<p>There was silence.<p>"Call me Oni-chan!" said Koryu sleepily as his prone body slowly  started coming to life, starting with his chest rising higher. His arms went behind   his head slowly stretching his upper body completely.<p>He opened one eye to look at Kasumi standing at the door as a faint click was heard indicating that she had locked the door.<p>"Wow, I didn't think you'd move that fast girl!" he said with a devilish smile.<p>Kasumi blushed but still maintained her serious look. "Koryu-san, if it   is not too much to-"<p>"Oni-chan!" Koryu repeated, fully awake now.<p>"Koryu-san, I need some help." said Kasumi with urgency.<p>"Che-" he replied, his fun never lasted long. "What happened?"<p>"Our fathers, I am sure they are planning something to do with another wedding. If things are not taken slowly, it could really get out of hand."<p>After a moment of silence Koryu spoke again.<p>"Does Ranma know?" asked Koryu, with a serious look on his face as he stood up and started dusting his pants. What he was dusting off, Kasumi had no idea.<br/>"I believe so. I think he was the first one to realize." replied Kasumi.<br/>"Then we have nothing to worry about. Come on Kasumi, I am sure by now you have realized what makes Ranma tick. Its not that hard. Honor. That was what was killing him inside with the Saffron deal. Now that that is restored... he has some thing that will keep him going. This is his life." Koryu walked over to the bed, reached his hands over the edge to help him stretch. He continued to stretch different parts of his body as he continued to speak.<p>"Besides, it would be like an insult to his honor if I went around helping him out. Let him take care of it. He's not dumb you know... his mind kind of seems to lock up, from what I experienced from his memories, when he is in proximity to girls but that is obviously because of his life on the road and the constant antagonistic remarks that he has been given for the past god knows how many years." Koryu said.<p>After the stretching, he turned around and went back to his corner, sitting back down again.<p>"I will talk with him and help him out, he still does seem to have a little misconceptions about what he has told to be and what he is led to belive. He lives in different shadows of honor. Whenever he has to make a decision, he always instinctively and subconsciously checks if his honor is not being hurt. But because he has different versions of honor. His father says one thing, his mother says something else. The fights with people have enlightened him and confused him in regards to honor. These feelings conflict with one another. He is also a very nice person so obviously that doesn't help much. Many times he is just does what comes naturally. Hence, the rough and in-appropriate behavior."<br/>Kasumi sat down on her bed and took off her ribbon and cast it aside. She turned to look at Koryu as she started playing with her hair as she often did when she was worried.<p>"Shadows of Honor?" she asked.<p>"Don't worry.. I'll explain it later. Anyways.. before continuing Kasumi, let just get one thing straight. I am not going to be solving Ranma's problems for him. I'll have to tell you something about myself and why I'm doing this. Will you take the time to listen? I suppose then you can tell me about Ranma and then we can go out for the evening. You can call me one of your old friends. I came by to say hi and took you out for the eavening. I think your father would be crying happy tears then, no?"said Koryu. He had this glint in his eye that made Kasumi giggle.<p>"Fine. I suppose we can do that. But don't you think its a little soon for you to start hitting on me?" asked Kasumi coyly. She didn't want to open up, but her current perception of Koryu indicated that he was respectable.<p>"Ha! Thats the way! You need to relax. Don't worry. I won't do nothin that you would ever regret. Besides I've already seen the looks you give Ranma." Koryu said, playing along with the girl.<p>"I am a girl after all. But did you know that his look changed completely after you left? I dunno how to explain it but it was as if... he just changed completely in front of my eyes. I have to admit, that was the first time I have ever been so physically attracted that I had to practically sprint to the kitchen." Kasumi admitted.<p>"Thats good to hear." Koryu smiled, though his eyes reflected a little sadness.<p>"Ranma's endured a lot. I only got flashes from his memory, stuff like his parents attitudes, and how they effected him, Akane of course and what people expected of him as he always tried to meet those expectations. I also got a glimpse of some of his fights with some kid called Toma, some Kirin dude and Ryoga...if I'm not mistaken. Thats all I got from him and frankly I didn't want to invade anymore into his private mind. I needed to know what kind of person he was. This is in fact a forbidden technique, reading people's minds. I only do it in the worst case scenarios."<p>Kasumi nodded, egging to him to go on. Koryu, for a second was further surprised at how the girl seemed to almost visibly absorb each and every word he was saying. He wished his subordinates had paid the same kind of attention she had. She was damn good looking to boot!<p>"Anyways... look... about me. I'll make it quick and simple. Keep in mind  that I am potentially putting you at risk by telling you who I am. I am a Ninja.<br/>I work for the Japanese Government in my world, Saffron doesn't exist in my world,<br/>but I can travel to other worlds and have done so through my portal when I am chasing criminals who use magic for personal gain, usually for something evil. I have yet to come across to see someone actually doing real good. I met Saffron on one of those worlds. I didn't want to bother explaining anything in detail at that time."<p>Koryu shrugged, changing shifting in his seat before continuing.<p>"So any ways, there are some rules a few of my friends and I have developed.   They are very , very simple. " he explained.<p>"I wouldn't like someone to come to my world and start doing weird things.<br/>Just the same, I wont do the same. I came here because of an emergency. You people  helped me out, gave me food, water and dressed my wounds" Koryu pointed towards the tray of food to his right and the medical kit that was in front of him.<p>"I will stay here, but no matter what I will not interfere with directly with anyone. Honestly, I shouldn't even do so indirectly but this time I will give it a break because I know I won't be doing anything stupid. I will talk to you, I will help you and Ranma... I can even help train him in his own fighting methodology. But I won't give him anything else... of course unless a life is threatened. No matter what, I am not going to watch someone die. That is the only exception I'm gonna make." finished Koryu.<p>"What if you can't do anything by that time?.. I mean what if things escalate too far?" asked Kasumi. She herself had a feeling that this would not happen. Koryu was right. Ranma wouldn't let it happen.<p>"Lets just say, I am powerful enough to beat several Saffrons. That is all I will say."<p>"You are that much more powerful than Ranma?" Kasumi asked wide eyed.<p>"I didn't say that. Ranma, is in fact quite a bit more powerful than I am. It depends on your perception." said Koryu, shaking his head.<p>"I don't understand."<p>"Look, I am trained to be an assassin, I use the element of surprise, silence,<br/>sneakiness and deception to carry out my tasks. Add that to what Ranma can do. Also,<br/>I am a summoner. I summon techniques and spirits, using their power to help me.<br/>I can do the hiryu shoten ha. But I actually summon the spiritual dragon itself.<br/>I can't be bothered to tell you the technicalities but that's how it goes. Ranma  does everything using his own power, his own ki. To be honest, if Ranma had received  training like mine? It would even give me the shivers to meet him as an opponent."<p>Koryu stopped to take a breath, looking at Kasumi to see if she was following  his words. There it was again. She seemed to give the phrase 'instantaneous absorption'   a new meaning. She just nodded for him to continue talking.<p>"He is powerful... very powerful. It is because of the fact that he has   fought countless foes and become a very advanced user of ki. He has also on   many occasions been outnumbered, has he not?" Koryu asked<p>Kasumi nodded again.<p>"It was as if he was destined to be a martial artist. I can't fight like him because then I wouldn't be able to use stealth. We are contrasting fighters. But back to the point, I am a dangerous person. Currently much more so than Ranma or Saffron. As to what else I can do... well I can't really tell you... ya know..."<p>Koryu smiled and then sighed.<p>"Okay! I'm done talking! Jeez. Your turn. If you don't mind giving me your personal" Koryu emphasized the last word," account of Ranma's life" he added with a wink.<p>The next half an hour was spent while discussing Ranma's past in detail. Much of that time Koryu couldn't help laughing at what could possibly go wrong with the poor guy's life. If his parents weren't hard enough... the rest of the people were.   Koryu did, for a second, seem annoyed at the mention of the Amazons. Kasumi didn't know what to think of the momentary display of negative emotion. She carried on with the story.<p>By around one PM, Kasumi finally finished explaining what she had heard of the fight at Phoenix Mountain as Koryu sat there wondering what to do from now on. She quickly told the rest of the story regarding the wedding disaster.<br/>She believed Koryu had to know about yesterday and Ranma's complete broken down form.<br/>"I see. So after the fight, then the wedding and blah blah. Now I know the rest. Right?" he said. He was beginning to have a migraine. He thought his life was chaotic.<br/>Koryu sighed before he   "Well now Kasumi-chan, now I think you and I should go out. How about this,<br/>you have to cook lunch... in the mean while I will quickly have a bath and head over to the shops to see if I can but some clothes. I'll come by and pick you up at around 3 pm. How's that? I gotta do some work any ways so you can relax and everything... if I run into Ranma.. I'll send him your love." Said Koryu with a smirk quickly as he immediately disappeared into the wall as if he just phased into it.<p>Kasumi just sat there on the bed, not knowing what to think. Then a slow smile spread on her delicate, radiant face. 'Why not?' She thought, not giving much heed to what Koryu had just done infront of her. She had seen stranger things with Ranma and Co like that time with Prince Toma, when she had herself disappeared into that strange shadow.<p>Its been a while since she'd actually gone out alone for fun. This will be her first date. Up till now Koryu had only been bugging her because , she assumed, he wanted to get some sort of rise out of her. It wouldn't be a bad idea. Maybe she would run into Ranma.<p>That could always be a possibility.<p>She almost swelled with happiness when she thought of the prospects. Realizing this, she felt that she had almost dedicated herself too much to her house hold and forgot to live as a person.<p>Damn. Koryu must have picked on that. How perceptive. Well, she did remember him looking all around the house yesterday evening. And he was a Ninja. Weren't ninja's originally used as spys?<p>She went to the door to open it up when she looked at a white paper stuck on   it with some writing. Not remembering anything on the door when she came in, Kasumi   inquisitively read the paper.<p>"Wear something formal or sexy. Please don't look like a house maid, Kasumi-chan." was scribbled on it.<p>'OOHhh... the nerve!' Kasumi sighed. 'Fine, two can play that game.' she said to herself as she walked out, doing a better job than a paper shredder with the note in her hands.<p>Only Nabiki and Akane where there for lunch. Neither Ranma, his father, nor her own were there.<p>"Any ideas of what to do? Kasumi?" asked Nabiki as she slowly ate her food while watching the tele.<p>"No, in fact I'm going to be going out. A friend called after quite a few years  and wants to take me out for the evening. I'll be gone probably for the rest of the   day." mumbled Kasumi.<p>Kasumi quickly finished her food and put her bowl down when she looked at Akane and Nabiki staring at her. "Umm.. something wrong?" she asked.<p>"You were eating almost as fast as Ranma!" Akane said in shock.<p>"Is that so Akane? This strange indeed isn't it?" Kasumi replied with a smile.<p>Nabiki almost choked when she saw that and flurried about coughing until Akane sent an open palm strike towards her back. She coughed out a piece of meat and looked wearily at Kasumi who smiled back sweetly asking if she wanted any water.<p>Not knowing what Kasumi was up to, not that she heard any telephone rings, Nabiki was beginning to get a little suspicious. She planned to stay out of the way though.<p>She and Kasumi had agreed that things were in fact getting out of hand and something had to be done subtly. But how going out with an old friend was going to help things, she had no idea.<p>She shrugged and decided to spend the rest of her day geared towards making some profits. Maybe she could put start putting betting pools on Kuno. It may look like something not worth it but it might just get people interested. She had to lay off Ranma, her main income, for a while at least.<p>As Kasumi got ready, she decided to put on one of her dresses she got in her senior year for a school dance she couldn't attend. She had borrowed Nabiki's make up and put on her mother's pearl necklace, trying to make sure Koryu would be impressed.<p>Apparently he had not used the Tendo bath, or at least she thought he didn't when he left.<p>She wondered where he would get the money. She certainly would take a leaf out of Nabiki's book and be quite expensive. That comment about looking like a house made...he needed a lesson in tact.<p>In her room, Kasumi did a little twirl in front of her mirror.<br/>Looking at herself , Kasumi felt somewhat happy that she was doing something just for the heck of it. She didn't know why she had agreed to Koryu's forceful invitation to an evening out. If Ranma believed him, she would. Besides, there was something going on inside that guy's brains. She couldn't wait to prod around with him. It has been a long time, since high school when she used to do that.<p>Wearing a low cut one piece eavening wear, black in color with more than normal amount of cleavage showing, her hair loose, low healed, delicate sandles, Kasumi walked out of her room, turning around only to lock it.   Her dress ended at her knees. She was never an exibitionist, but Kasumi did know that she had, what guys would consider, nice legs. She had maintained her body as well as possible. Single handidly maintaining the Tendo household was quite a bit of work out. Did wonders for her body.<p>When she came down her father was home and seemingly turned into stone when he looked at her. "Hi father, I'm going out with a friend who should be here any minute to pick me up. We'll be spending the rest of the evening out. I made enough food for everyone to have dinner as well. All you have to do is heat the food Nabiki."<p>"Don't worry, I'll do it Nee-chan" came Akane's voice from upstairs.<p>"Oh Wow! Nee-chan you look... you look... dazzling!" Akane couldn't hide her awe at her elder sister. She had completely transformed. She looked like a model in her current getup.<p>Akane just continued to stare at her sister from the stairs as Nabiki came behind Kasumi and whispered something in her ear.<p>Kasumi beamed and whispered something back to Nabiki.<p>"What are ya whispering about?"<p>Nabiki paled. 'Umm we were talkin about wether it is possible for you to mess up food by using the micro-wave.'.. There was no way Nabiki was gonna say that.<p>"Girl talk Akane. I'll fill you in when I come back" said Kasumi with a wink, not even missing a beat As Nabiki smiled weakly behind her.<p>It was three PM. Kasumi just walked out of the house after kissing Mr. Stone Tendo on the cheek and saying bye to everyone.<br/>When she walked out of the gates she ran into Koryu who was currently   leaning against the wall. He was dressed in a black suit wearing a   light blue shirt and a dark blue tie with grey strips on it<p>All in all he looked quite handsome. He was a good looking person any ways.<p>"Good afternoon Kasumi-san" said Koryu formally with a serious look, bowing a little deep.<p>"Oh.. no Kasumi-chan? I was getting quite used to it." said Kasumi as she lightly returned the bow.<p>"I just wanted to apologize if I was being too friendly for comfort. You seemed quite upset and genuinely concerned. I just wanted you to have at least some sort of feeling that things were going to be alright. Frankly, even if I wasn't here... they would be. "<p>"It's alright. I actually appreciate it. It feels refreshing. Someone treating me differently than the usual. I guess that is the only reason why I'm doing something like this."<p>Kasumi stood there, looking at Koryu as if she was expecting, something else from him. He stood there dumbfounded.<p>"Shall we go?" he asked.<p>"God, you are as clueless as Ranma aren't you?" Kasumi asked, shaking her head, smiling inwardly to herself.<p>"Oh? Really? Now why you are constantly thinking about him I wonder." said Koryu with a smirk as they had started walking down the street.<p>Kasumi turned around and quickly punched Koryu on the shoulder, only to have her fist deftly caught.<p>"My my Kasumi-chan. Such a contrast to the young lady I met last night and this morning. Whatever in the world happened? I also hope you can fight better than this. Someone could easily take advanta. urk" Koryu couldn't continue as he felt pain on a certain part of his male anatomy.<p>It hurt. That dull pain. He would rather have lightning strike him down.<p>"Believe me, I can take care of myself well enough Koryu-chan." said Kasumi giving her trade mark smile of infinite sweetness as she retracted her knee and continued walking down the street.<p>'No way... How?' Koryu didn't have the current ability to voice those thoughts. Damn, so she really had held back so much of her personality infront of her family?<p>She had explained to him Akane and her father's reaction when she tried to guide Akane not to use violence against the boys in Furinkan.<p>Akane, on a subconscious level, was happy she was getting attention which was something she had always gotten since she was a kid. She was the youngest so she did get the most attention at the expense of the elder sisters.   At the same time, the fights and her ambition or arrogance at being the best martial artist in Nerima did not help her any.<p>Mr Tendo had told Kasumi strictly to let her be, and find her own destiny. Saying that she had to be tough to be a martial artist.<p>Koryu still did not understand the thinking of the Saotome and Tendo patriarchs, but he believed that Mr Tendo gave Akane most freedom because she chose to practice the art. Since the others never did, Kasumi and Nabiki did not receive such freedom. Its not that he didn't care for them. He just didn't provide that must leeway. He always overlooked Akane's flaws instead of correcting them.<p>A big mistake. He was lucky that Nabiki and Kasumi, for the love of their family had not gone astray. Koryu had seen many instances of jealousy between siblings leading to many a bizarre situations. One of them very, very personal.<p>Akane, on the other hand was prone to violence because she has not been taught other ways of dealing with people, namely boys.<p>"Your father actually raised his voice at you when you tried confronting him about Akane's behavior?" asked Koryu when he somehow slowly managed to catch up with Kasumi.<p>"Hmm? Oh that... yes he did. He actually looked quite scary. Akane also seemed quite satisfied when that happened." replied Kasumi in a bit a meek voice.<p>"Maybe he regrets that now. He always cries if there is a hint of anything happening to me. But I have a feeling its because I look a lot like mother. That's why."<p>Koryu sighed.<p>"Well Kasumi-hime, I hope I can be a good escort to you for the rest of the day. For your kindness and concern that you showed me even when Ranma warned you... I shall repay you ten fold. Just don't knee me in like that. You remind me of someone." muttered Koryu.<p>They continued walking into the main city as the weather was quite nice outside. Kasumi placed her arm in Koryu's with a gracious smile when he had raised it for her.<p>"I do? Who do I remind you of?"<p>"Well.. she's kind of like my mother."<p>"Your mother? Oh my, I do hope that is a good thing."<p>"Yea...well.. she's not my real mother.. she kinda took me in."<p>"I suppose you don't get to see her that often, then do you, in your line of work."<p>"More than you would emagine." came a dry reply.<p>Kasumi twisted her eye brows in response. 'Boy if Ranma saw her right now he would freak. It should be a sin looking this beautiful.' Koryu thought in a private part of his mind.<br/>"Well.. you see... she is MY Commanding Officer."<p>Koryu smiled at Kasumi's mirth as she almost burst out laughing...<p>"Your superior knees you in the groin?" she asked still trying to contain her laughter, hanging on his arm in the process.<p>"Yea well... its kinda weird, we are kind of like a family so when she gets quite annoyed with me... which I regret to inform you is quite often... she does sometimes show her feelings by a good knee or kick or something."<p>"I guess you and Ranma really are alike then aren't you?"<p>A quick thought came to Koryu's mind but he stowed it away.<br/>for the time being anyways... he decided to answer the question  directly<p>"I guess so, though the kindness she shows me and how she behaves towards me far outweighs her anger. Besides... she has a habit of getting annoyed when it really is my fault. She doesn't blame me for anything she cannot handle... if you get my drift."<p>"All too clear Koryu-chan... all too clear. Thank you.. I really have not laughed like that in a very long time."<p>"Ah! but the date has just begun! Lets see... Shall we go to a movie? you what kind of movie would you like to see?" said Koryu...not really giving a damn as to why he was acting this way with this girl. He had not ever acted like this with anyone ever before.<p>And so they went off...Enjoying each other's company towards the near by cinema as she had reached the shopping area.<p>In the mean time...Ranma Saotome, heir to the Saotome  School of Anything Goes Indiscriminate Grappling, sat atop the Furinkan High main building staring off into the horizon, deep in thought.<p>"Shadows of Honor" he repeated to himself for the hundredth time.<p>Koryu had seen him a while ago ...catching up to him when he was running on the fences trying to do something new by sprinting, stopping immediately and sprinting the other way. It wasn't as easy as it looked.   He almost slipped and fell many times. Just as fate would have it, Koryu suddenly landing behind him on the fence without any warning, and not having being sensed put Ranma off as he fell into the canal.<p>Koryu took the transformation quite well. His facial expression didn't change one bit when he saw Ranma-chan jump out and scream at his face about surprising him. What did he say? oh yea.<p>"Just become better then."<p>It wasn't that easy. It never was, and it probably never will be.<br/>But then again, Ranma supposed, that that's what made it worth while.<p>After Ranma had explained the story, though he really figured Koryu knew already from the whole spiritual memory reading thingy, Koryu jumped down in the water, picked some up in his hands as they started glowing, becoming enraged in flames. Ranma was not totally astonished but he was a bit surprised.<p>Koryu was willing to show him a technique. He could see after a while the flames had stopped, and threw the water at Ranma. It was hot, but not boiling, sending a tingling confirmation through his body as he lost and gained certain physical parts of it that were gender wise specific.<p>Ranma transformed back to his male form.<p>He had already told him that techniques were one of the few things he would not show for his safety reasons. Ranma figured Koryu was opening up to him only to show he was willing to go the distance if Ranma was willing as well. In his life... no one had every done that. To have someone do this for them.<p>Koryu deserved respect. He had helped Ranma overcome one of his life's greatest disasters. Only in doing that, Koryu had already returned any kindness he claimed to have gotten from Ranma.<p>This maybe the ability to read another's state of mind, then again maybe not, but Ranma had the feeling Koryu saw something in Ranma he liked. He truly wanted Ranma to become a better man for himself and no one else.<p>Ranma doubted Koryu would really gain anything from this. From what he had explained, and told that he had explained the same to Kasumi as well, he was taking a risk by staying in one place and getting involved with people.<p>After the transformation, Koryu asked where Ranma wouldn't mind going, specifically a high altitude place where one could see the horizon.<p>So then they found themselves at Furinkan High.<p>Koryu had wanted to talk to him about what he had stated earlier about the Shadows of Honor. That conversation had made everything else in his life he had gone through seem almost worthless in comparison.<br/>No. That wasn't right. It was because he had gone through all that he could now understand the meaning of those simple three words. Had he not felt those emotions, had he not gone through those mentally and physically damaging circumstances, he would not have truly accepted the wisdom these simple three words provided him with.<p>He just could not believe it.<p>He felt different, he could even believe he was in a new body. As if he had been given a new chance at life!<br/>It took him over an hour to go through many instances of his life and how he had seen them described before. He compared those mental, emotional descriptions that had become almost burned into his mind, body and soul, with what he believed now.<br/>He had re-defined his honor. It was not so difficult to make any choice anymore. It was clear as day now. Of course it made nothing easier, but that was the trick. He knew now what steps to take should any of his feared situations arise.<br/>He had broken free from the bindings of the Shadows of Honor. He defined his own shadow. In the light he would stand not behind anyone elses shadow, but directly into the light itself. He would cast his own shadow. In the darkness, he would become his own shadow.<p>No longer confused.<p>Scared, yes, but fear was as much part of life as it was part of death. For many fear death even from those who claim that they do not. For it is only human to do so.<p>Death will come once for everyone. So what should truly be feared is the lack of life while you live. If one does not live while alive, then what is the meaning in death?<p>How one chooses to live while alive, is that one person's choice. That choice is what should be reflected in the shadow that person casts when he or she stands out in the light.<p>When one is young, they only stood within other shadows.<br/>As they grew, they cast their own shadows within these shadows.<br/>Should there be a difference, there would always be conflicts. These conflicts should however be resolved. The correct ones may not always win, but it was the belief that mattered.<p>The more shadows you have come across, the more conflicts you have had, the stronger beliefs that you have chosen to cast in your own shadow would be. For when the darkness comes, as it comes many a times in life, you will become your shadow, and it will define you.<p>He was free.   Ranma was free from the bull his father had taught him. True, there were things which he believed were correct. His pop was wasn't an evil or a real bad man. He was just a petty selfish person with an ambition he wanted to fulfill regardless of others' feelings. If his honor required that, it did not necessarily mean Ranma's honor would. It took all types to make the world after all.<p>Ranma realized now what he had been doing wrong. Unable to keep his happiness in, Ranma had to somehow let it out. He figured letting out a great ki blast would do just fine. He summoned his ki in together, feeling it as if it was going through his veins... as if it was his blood, he accumulated everything he could muster from his mind and body, focused it into a ki blast that was no larger than a basket ball, professional size.<p>He considered it putting all the bullshit he had gone through up till now in that one basket ball sized ki blast. He would live by his rules now. His Honor was re-defined. He would keep it. And if he found a flaw, then he would accommodate it.<p>Ranma's hands were glowing. His body was glowing. The glow was bright orange, and was so bright that Ranma's shadow had disappeared from behind. It was replaced by an orange hue that looked a lot like the evening sky.<p>Finally deciding to let go of all the pent up emotions Ranma had kept in, he let off the mother of all ki blasts as a sonic boom was heard from the building. The ki blast soared up into the sky and disappeared almost instantly.<p>After adjusting his eyes, as the ki blast was bright enough to be a second sun, Ranma fell to his knees, totally exhausted.<p>'Damn, that was probably the most powerful ki blast I have ever let off in my life.' he thought to himself. 'Lets not do that again...I could seriously kill myself if I don't control it...I'd rather be held by Kasumi any day. Besides, it felt so much like I was in heaven and-..' Ranma stopped in mid thought...<p>'Ok man, now you are delirious Ranma'. But wait... its true, No one else had ever listened to him. No one else had. Maybe Akane could, but she didn't. Even the others had been kind to him on occasion. But not when it had really counted. Kasumi did, Kasumi helped him, she held him, she cried with him. And she never had asked for anything in return. Even Akane wanted some sort of appreciation for her efforts for Ranma, like him totally ignoring Ukyo and everyone else.<p>Besides, it didn't mean anything now. Kasumi was someone who Ranma knew, deep in his heart, that would listen to him for his happiness. She had shown that, thought Ranma still had to ask her about the teleportation thing she seemed to have done. It would be an amazing technique to add to his arsenal. Ranma knew he needed Kasumi to help him solve his problems. He needed an ear, and maybe a close friend to hold him. She had done that already once. He needed nothing else. He needed someone he could trust.<br/>Koryu had blatantly told Ranma that he would not take part in any decision making Ranma did. He would not take part in any fight Ranma got into. It was Ranma's life and Ranma was going to live it.<p>That would be cool, but Ranma really didn't think he could do it without Kasumi. She even said she would try to help... didn't she? Ranma couldn't remember too well. Anyways,the best thing to do now was to go find her and talk to her.<p>With that in mind, he quickly jumped off as he knew there were some people, whom by the way he didn't want to meet at the moment, that would be arriving very shortly to Furinkan High.<p>'Hmm Koryu said that he was taking Kasumi out to a movie or something so she would get out of the house and atleast enjoy an evening out without any homely pressures. That'd be cool. Maybe I can find them and say hi. I am sure Kasumi wouldn't mind, and I really want to tell her what I managed to find in myself today. But wait... I look normal. Koryu was in a full suit. Kasumi would probably be dressed formal as well.'   Dressing formal to a movie? Ranma figured he might as well just drop by anyways... Koryu could probably find him if Ranma had let off another one of his ki blasts in the city, towards the sky of course.<br/>As Ranma roof hopped, he noticed he could go further in each hop and had more control with his movements. 'Damn, this Shadows of Honor thing really is meant mainly for martial artists, even if Koryu said it could be applied in any area of life'<br/>Ranma had little idea how true he was.<br/>As he came to the city, he saw a public bath. The idea did cross his mind to go in but he had little money. He put his hands down in is pockets as he strolled on the sidewalk.<br/>"Huh?"<p>Kasumi and Koryu had enjoyed a nice romantic comedy movie that Kasumi had wanted to since she saw its poster while shopping for groceries.<p>It was not a long movie, only about one and a half hour. Quite short, in fact for its genre. But it was a good one. What Kasumi found highly interesting was that, from what she had heard of Ranma's escapades, it would almost be funnier watching Ranma's life, if one managed to suspend their belief of real emotions that sometimes can seriously cause angst.<p>"So Kasumi-hime, how did you like the movie?" asked Koryu, still maintaining his royal act.<p>"You can stop now, the charm seems to have worn off, maybe you can find it on the seat or on the floor or something." Kasumi replied, giving Koryu a side glance.<p>"Oh but your highness, I am but only here to serve." Koryu replied while bowing, not holding back his attitude towards Kasumi as if she was royalty.<p>"Sure you are. I know something is playing on your mind. What are you up to Koryu-chan?"<p>"You wound me your highness, I swear to you that I have planned, nothing. I swear to you on my honor." Koryu did a slightly exaggerated display of clutching his heart as if it hurt quite badly.<p>Kasumi reluctantly held back the inkling feeling to knee him again as they exited the cinema. She was actually quite hungry. In anticipation to the date, she had not eaten much lunch.<p>She smiled sweetly as she plotted what she would like to eat and from where. She didn't know where he got the money from nor did she ask. She just knew where he would be spending it.<p>She wanted to find something really expensive because her appetite wasn't much. It would have to be a small, but really expensive dish if she wanted to annoy Koryu.<p>She looked at him as she started walking in a random direction, If Ranma would have been here then...Ranma! Where was he? What was he doing.<p>Some of her emotions must have reflected on her face because Koryu turned towards and looked at her curiously. It was as if he was watching the internal struggle that had just begun. She was worried for Ranma. Hopefully he hadn't gotten into another fight again.<p>She decided to voice her question, already knowing that Koryu was going to tease her again. This was not romantic interest. She was worried for him. Fine, since yesterday, she had felt closer to him than she had ever felt to even her father. But it was still a deep caring feeling.<p>"Umm.. If you don't mind my asking. Do you know where Ranma is?" she asked.<p>As expected, Koryu's face split into a big grin. He was, in fact, the first time since he came to this world, grinning like an idiot.<p>"Well, I see you could not keep him out of your mind for long, could you Kasumi-chan."said Koryu.<p>Well, atleast he had dropped the Kasumi-hime. Kasumi let out a slightly annoyed breath, as she cleaned some of the remains of pop-corn that she had just realized were on her dress.<p>"I am worried for him. I don't want him to get into any more fights until he has emotionally recovered. He may have looked much better this morning but Elder Ku Lon and grandfather Happosai are two people who can still cause him problems." explained Kasumi.<p>Koryu looked at Kasumi, standing there infront of him. He had to fight off the urge to laugh this hard. This was getting increasingly difficult.<p>"Kasumi?" came a voice from behind her. Koryu arched his eye brows at Kasumi as she looked at him in confusion and turned around. Only to see Ranma a few meters away. He seemed to have just walked out of a clothes shop.<p>Ranma was well... dressed to kill. He wore black pants with a dark-ish  blue full sleeve Chinese shirt, similar to what he usually worn. He also wore   a black waist coat with golden dragons embroidered on each side of the chest that   went over the shoulder to the back. The waist coat however, was kept open as Ranma had properly tucked in his shirt and was wearing a sleek leather belt with a golden belt buckle with the shape of a dragon head.<p>Hey! She's a woman. Give her a break while her heart flutters and she just stands there looking at Ranma in the evening sun. His eyes, reflecting the rays, as he stutters like a blithering idiot, trying to comprehend how beautiful Kasumi looked.<p>Ranma finally realized that he did have his legs as he started walking towards the two people he had come to trust completely in the last almost twenty four hours.<p>"Oh My! Ranma you look really nice!" said Kasumi barely controlling herself.   Koryu laughed a bit that . 'Well, even if she had held back most of her personality to provide as much as she can for her family, I guess she really is a generally sweet and innocent girl. But damn does she know how to take a man down' said Koryu in a private part of his mind as he watched Ranma try again, for the second time to praise Kasumi on her looks.<p>The elation she felt was so strong that even Koryu supposed he felt a bit of it. Suddenly it felt cold. Koryu wondered what happened when he saw her looking at him as if she was about to burn a hole through his head.<br/>"You said you were not planning anything! I know you did this   Koryu-chan. Here I was so worried for him and you-"<p>"You were worried for me?" asked Ranma.<p>"Well, why should I not. I don't want you going through anything like you have been through lately. Not if I can do anything about it!" said Kasumi a little vehemently.<p>"Thanks... Kasumi. You have no idea how nice it is to hear that."<p>"..sigh.. Oh Ranma, its alright. I am just a little annoyed at Koryu who has been teasing me for a while every time I asked about you and well... I really wanted to know."<p>"I am fine Kasumi...thank you." If he would die now, he would die a happy man. He felt that good. How, in 24 hours could his life do a complete one-eighty and start heading in the other direction?<p>Ranma looked at Koryu.<p>"Hey man, don't look at me. I've done my duty." said Koryu, backing up a bit.<p>Ranma and Kasumi looked at him questioningly.<p>"Kasumi-chan... didn't I tell you that I would be your escort this evening?"<p>Kasumi nodded.<p>"Well, my lady, my task is complete." said Koryu with a final bow. Unknown to them, Koryu was seriously bowing with respect, and caring. In his time of  difficulty, they had been kind to him, forgetting instantly that they had problems of their own.<p>He was a Ninja. He lived by the old code.<p>Ranma stood there a little dumbfounded.<p>"Uh so wait, you expected me to come?" he asked Koryu<p>"Actually, I had no idea. I just left you money and some wisdom that was given  to me some time back. Everything else was your choice and your choice   should give you an idea of how powerful ones choices can be when made by the  clarity of mind. I had absolutely no idea you would want to come and see Kasumi,<br/>the first thing when you had solved your internal conflicts." said Koryu honestly.<p>"So how did you know I.. oh the ki blast? You heard it?"<p>"Heard it Ranma? I felt the damn thing! It wasn't a negative based, attack either. For you to have come up with that sort of an attack given your current body, you much have been really really happy. Even I cannot produce a ki blast that strong."<p>"Really?" Ranma had to ask.<p>"I have no reason to lie to you. And as for you Kasumi-chan, I hope that I have satisfied your request."<p>When he saw the confused look on Kasumi's face turn into a blank one, then into a happy, grateful one, he felt he might as well say a little more.<p>"You wanted help today to keep your fathers from that whole marriage, thing right? I kept you away from the house and I explained Ranma something I strongly believed he should understand. I took you out to the movies and maybe dinner because you were so stressed out in the morning. I figured you would enjoy your self. I hope you did."<p>Kasumi's smile told him that she did, in fact enjoy the day.<p>"Now. I believe there is no need for you to ask for my help because I think that things will now be under control... right Ranma?"<p>"Hell no... they're gonna get really weird now... but yea.. I get the point. I guess all ya wanted to tell me was I'll have to think for myself instead of always thinking what my old man or mom or other people say... right?"<p>"To put it simply, yea... But it goes much deeper than that." Koryu stated.<p>"Oh yea.. way deeper. I was really surprised when I finally started, like, ya know.. making sense about this whole deal. Kinda like..I dunno.. I felt like a new man."<p>Kasumi smiled at Ranma. "What are you talking about? I'm sorry but I'm a little lost."<p>Don't worry about it Kasumi... I'll explain to ya. I came here first thing just to see you. I wanted you to be the first person I tell this to. Come to think of it, I can't tell anyone else can I? Well the deal is that you were the first person I thought of. Things will start getting really interesting from now on. And I suppose it'll turn into how it was before I went to China. But slowly it will change."<p>Kasumi was surprised. To be thought of first? It was expected but Ranma had wanted to see her first thing, and she was the first person he thought of. Kasumi smiled widely in the direction of Ranma, closing her eyes, a hue of red crawling apon her cheeks.<br/>"Well, that's great news. Now.. Lets see.. I really wasn't planning on Ranma coming here, but hey.. if that's what happened.. that's how it was meant to be." shrugged Koryu casually.<p>"I guess I will do one thing for the both of you today. I will keep people away from you. Don't worry about how I'll do it. But I think the both of you should go and have a nice long night out." Koryu said. Loosing his care free attitude as he became gently serious again.<p>"I dunno much about fates or destiny. Nor to I ever question it.<br/>I never thought much of it, but I swear to you I had not planned on anything  like this happening. Kasumi was constantly asking about Ranma.. and Ranma   came to find Kasumi as soon as he had solved his internal conflicts. Looks to  me like the both of you atleast deserve to spend the evening together"<p>Koryu switched between the two people, looking at one while he was talking about the other.<br/>Both Ranma and Kasumi looked like a bunch of school kids they way they were blushing. Koryu chuckled slightly at their display of innocence.<p>"Look, what you do is your thing. I would just say you take a long walk and head down to an expensive restaurant and have a good dinner or something while talking to each other."<br/>Ranma walked forward and bowed towards Koryu. Koryu actually freaked a little bit that. "What do ya think your doing bowing towards me ya idiot?"<p>"Thanks man. I really appreciate what you did for me." said Ranma.<p>He may have been a little flabbergasted at Kasumi's beauty but he certainly had changed. It showed in the way he carried himself. Well, Koryu was glad he had gotten something out of it.<p>"I only returned the favor, Ranma. Now I suppose you two should get going. You two seem to be quite the couple."<p>"Koryu... its nothing like that... I am just-"<p>Kasumi was cut of by Ranma's laugh.<p>"If only I was so lucky, Koryu" said Ranma to Kasumi's surprise and   embarrassment.<p>"Maybe you are... you'll never know if ya don't try" edged Koryu.<p>"Yea man.. whatever. Why don't you come with us?" Ranma asked.<p>"And destroy the moment between the two of you.. naa I really think the both of you have deserved this time off from your daily load of problems. Besides... I don't want go get hurt."<p>Ranma looked to question that statement when Koryu quickly waved it off.<p>Ranma considered that for a second before he turned towards the gorgeous brown eyed girl. "What do you think?"<p>"I think its up to him wether he wants to come or not. But I really want to hear this thing you wanted to tell me." said Kasumi sweetly.<p>"Alright... whatever I'll see ya later." said Ranma to Koryu as he turned   around and started walking with Kasumi. They walked comfortably, not to close to each other, nor too far. It seemed like a perfect companionable distance. Ranma had already begun telling Kasumi about the Shadows of Honor theory.<p>"Later." said Koryu. He had his work cut out. He knew that the people known as Ku Lon and Happosai would be out and about searching for the source of the ki blast. He smiled for a bit. He couldn't wait until tomorrow. Things were finally starting to stir.<p>From now on, he would do nothing but SLEEP and watch what happens. That is until his bloody wounds heal and he can gain enough strength to go back home.<p>End of Chapter 3
