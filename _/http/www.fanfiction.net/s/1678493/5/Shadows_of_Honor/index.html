</div>Chapter 5: Respect! The New Ranma Saotome.<p>The chirping of birds and the slight glow in the horizon signified the morning. Long shadows of street lamps and houses were created as they became more solid, the brighter the day became.<p>Ranma slowly came to consciousness at his usual time, just before the sunrise. He sat up and moved out of his futon, remembering being laid down on the floor last night.<p>'Hmm.. I wonder who moved me into the futon.' he silently thought to himself as he went to the bathroom for his morning business, and for a change of clothes. Soon after he had left for his shrine to start his morning ritual.<p>The dojo was a place where he felt he belonged. Whenever he felt relaxed, happy, sad, angry, frustrated, he could come to the dojo. Inside the four walls, there was something he could do with his feelings, to a certain extent.<p>In the beginning of every move, wether it be a punch, kick, or even a jump, he could somehow represent those emotions by encapsulating them in his soul. It was then a simple matter of putting his soul into every movement to its end, further more starting with another one.<p>It is easier said than done, but for Ranma, this was almost how he prayed. He poured his soul into the art. Today however, he was slightly distracted as he performed his kata.<p>'Damn, I wanna know how I could beat Koryu in a fight.' He thought. Koryu was hurt, yet he could fight like that. That.. leaning. The fluid transformation from one stance to another. He had used several stances in the fight. It was as if that man's stance was the changing of stances, if one could understand that.<p>Ranma stopped his kata prematurely to momentarily think, picturing the entire fight that took place right where he stood at this time, the day before. Koryu's strength felt as if it was bordering on the power level of Ryoga. He seemed to have more of a water flowing movement than Ranma had expected.<p>Figuring it would be better to mimic some of Koryu's movements he remembered from yesterday, Ranma opted to throw a straight kick he remembered quite well. It had done a number on his guard, breaking right through it and tagging him on the shoulder.<p>Ranma got into Koryu's stance and kicked in a similar fashion.<p>It was a weak kick. Ranma felt off balanced.<p>He kicked again, trying to perfect the image of Koryu he had in his mind as he forced his body to replicate it. This time it felt like a stronger kick but it left Ranma off balance again. How was he supposed to fight like this?<p>Ranma tried yet again to mimic the kick, deciding to add the fluidity of Koryu to it. He felt his arms flex from the twist in the waist as he followed through, going off balance again, this time falling to the ground.<p>The kick felt strong. It felt stronger than his usual kick, in that it was faster. The louder swish of the air dispersing was reason enough to believe that. Good. He was getting the hang of it. The balance was still a problem though.<p>He got up and attempted it again. He didn't fall but did look like he was doing some sort of a ballet routine as he hopped around for a moment. He was about to kick again when a random thought came.<p>'Its worth a try.' Ranma said to himself. He re-did the kick and immediately followed through with a reverse elbow just as he was about to lose his balance. It worked perfectly. The reverse elbow cut through the air like sword. He wasn't prepared for what came after so he landed on his shoulder.<p>'Damn. This means I have to continue with moves not to fall  out of balance? There's got to be a way to stop after pulling through  a move.'<p>Getting back into his stance, Ranma reanalyzed the moves. He had felt his arms strain more than usual when he kicked, and he had felt the same for his legs when he maneuvered through the reverse elbow.<p>Ranma's eyes widened in realization. This fighting methodology pushed every part of his body no matter what move he pulled. All the muscles had to be constantly strained in order to continue fighting like that, using fluidity to add to the momentum of each and every hit to make it stronger. That is what made it deadly.<p>Each movement, no matter how small or insignificant was supposed to have the strength of the entire body behind it! Though that was the case to some extent in the Anything Goes, which itself was a mixture of many martial arts styles, Anything Goes did not go that far.<p>This was more of a fighting attitude rather than a style. It constantly kept pushing the body to its limits. No wonder his muscles were so heavily toned. When he fought or trained, each and every muscle in body was being pushed to its maximum.<p>'Now to handle the endings of the moves.' Ranma told himself as he tried many different combo's, at first slowly and then slightly faster. He realized, after a while that he had to slightly change the transitions between moves to incorporate the momentum. At the same time he had to stop being rigid at times.<p>The Anything Goes, while flexible, at times had some rigid moves. When Ranma fought, like with the tenshin amaguriken, he tended to relax his legs. If he managed to do that move using this way, each and every punch could be as or almost as strong as Ryoga's punches. Ranma had to admit though, that doing the amaguriken like this was almost impossible right now.<p>After half an hour's exertion, Ranma managed to do a single punch or kick and stop without loosing much balance. It felt really invigorating. He had already begun sweating.<p>The more he practiced, the better he got, the more amazed Ranma became at Koryu's skill. Using momentum so deftly in mid air combat was very dangerous. Even more so on the ground. If any move went wrong, you would precisely be throwing yourself into your enemies attack.<br/>'I am used to living on the edge.' Ranma remembered Koryu's words the night he came. Kasumi was commenting on the wounds when he had replied that he was alright. These wounds, while definitely bad, wouldn't kill him.<p>Ranma grinned. He didn't know what Koryu had gone through to adopt this type of attitude towards fighting constantly on the edge, but he sure liked it.<p>It took Ranma almost forty five minutes to try out many different moves and combo's he knew in variations. He messed up sometimes, and the others, he managed to pull off. He was about to start re-doing his Kata this he realized someone was close by.<p>Ranma turned around to find Kasumi standing there leaning  against the door<p>"Good morning Ranma. Breakfast will be ready in almost half  an hour. Did you have a nice sleep?" said Kasumi<p>"Oh Good morning. Yea, I did actually. But I don't remember anyone putting me into the futon."<p>"Thats because you were already asleep when I did silly."<p>"You did?"<p>"Yes, I came in to give you a good night kiss and saw you asleep, not in a futon. So I set it up for you and somehow dragged you." said Kasumi as sweetly as ever.<p>"Good night kiss?"<p>Kasumi started giggling.<p>"Did you?"<p>"Wouldn't you like to know." she said, continuing to giggle.<p>Ranma made a small frown but it soon turned into a smile. She was being care free. He didn't want her to feel caged like she said last night. He didn't care how she teased him. It was fun.<p>Some part of his mind, somewhere deep, an inkling feeling wished that she had. He would just rather have been awake.<p>"Sorry I didn't notice ya, I was really trying hard to master Koryu's style of fighting."<p>"Koryu's style?"<p>Kasumi walked up to Ranma looking at him curiously.<p>"Yea. Its really cool."<p>Ranma explained to Kasumi the basics of how Koryu had fought him yesterday. He also told her that he figured that one way for him to beat Koryu was to learn to fight like how Koryu fought, and find the flaws.<p>"So you see, its amazing! He almost doubles the speed and strength and really quickly changes between stances that!" Ranma snapped his fingers for the added effect.<p>"Instantaneously" Kasumi offered<p>"huh?"<p>"Instantaneously" she repeated.<p>"Oh.. yea. He instantaneously changes between his stances anytime things are going against him. So thats how he... keeps away from the drawbacks. Its not like his other stances are weak either. They're almost just as hard. Then, when you think you got him, he immediately reverts back. I was about to do that right now. I was going to practice a few katas like this and try to change stances within moves. It wont be easy but if I keep on going at it... I'll be able to fight him by the end of the week using his own fighting style!"<p>Kasumi smiled at that.<p>"Looks like his fear will come true after all"<p>"Fear?" Ranma enquired.<p>"Yesterday morning, when we talked... he said you were more powerful than him when it came to ki. He also said that it would scare him to face you as an opponent, if you had been trained like he was."<p>"Well, this is not going to be easy. I have to like re-train my body to move like that. I have to re-learn my katas in a way. Also what gets to me is I don't know how I can change my stances instantly. Also, doing something like that while in mid-air combat, even if it is my specialty, I dunno how to go about it." Ranma admitted.<p>Aligning his feet carefully, Ranma got into his standard stance, and slowly moved through a few a moves before Kasumi spoke up.<p>"How about using ki?" she suggested.<p>"Ki?" Ranma tilted his head to the right, screwing up his facial features. Realization dawned on him as he understood what she meant, and it showed.<p>"YEA! I can can't I? I mean forget about the Hi Ryu Shoten Ha, but Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken is a physical technique, and I use my ki in it." Ranma exclaimed in excitement.<p>"Damn, its going to be hard though. I mean I only use most of my ki in special attacks. Now I'll have to be using it constantly throughout and thats going to take a lot of stamina. Not to mention I will be using almost all my muscles in my body already. I'll have to concentrate while fighting. But yeah! That could work!"<p>Kasumi simply smiled, turned around and walked towards the kitchen.<p>"Looks like you got your work cut out for you then. Something to occupy your  time. Koryu did also say that you had become a very advanced ki user. While he uses spirits, you use your own ki." she said.<p>"Spirits?" Ranma stopped in mid - elation.<p>"I'll tell you some other time. You should concentrate on your training now. Just don't forget about me though." Kasumi said playfully.<p>"Forget about you? How could I? You are the one who gave me this brilliant idea. I owe you one Kasumi. Thanks." said Ranma.<p>He was grateful that Kasumi decided to visit him in the dojo. He wouldn't have thought about the ki thing otherwise. Besides, he enjoyed talking to her. She had a calming effect on him. But then again, she had a calming effect on anybody. The way she behaved last night appeared like a dream to Ranma.<p>"Hmmmm is that so?" Kasumi stopped at the dojo door. She turned around slightly wearing a sly smile with an eye closed.<p>"I guess I'll hold you up to that. You'll have to do whatever I want." she said. Consequently, Kasumi walked out the door towards the kitchen. She was thinking about what Ranma had just told her.<p>It seems Koryu-chan might have under estimated Ranma's adaptive ability. Its the one thing he has been doing constantly... especially after he arrived in Nerima. Adapting to new styles.<p>Back in the dojo, Ranma looked at the doorway Kasumi had just passed through with a mixed expression. He still had to get used to a girl smiling like that and not relating it to being insulted, or bashed in later.<p>It was Kasumi, someone who's presence he'd learned to enjoy in the last 2 days.. or a day and a quarter.<p>Undaunted, Ranma started performing all his katas again one by one, concentrating on using his ki, infusing it within his body while trying to master Koryu's method of momentum based fighting.<p>"I'll get this yet. If not a day, then a week or even a month. I'll get it and if I can, I'll get a re-match from Koryu."<p>Outside, in the Tendo compound, a lone figure stood, silently watching Ranma through the ajar doors. 'Damn. I Don't believe it. He mimicked my entire fighting stance and moves using memories a day old. The spar lasted only for fifteen minutes. I was right, you are a scary opponent. I don't know how I did, but I severely under estimated you. Damnit, you are also on your way to mastering my fighting style.' thought Koryu as he stood there in the tree, completely hiding his presence.<p>There were very few people he respected when it came to warriors. Very  few indeed. Through his young life he had fought countless people, but never truly  did he respected anyone. He could count them on one hand, the people he respected,<br/>most of those weren't because of martial arts abilities.<p>He had no choice but to add Ranma Saotome to that list. Given time,<br/>he was absolutely positive Ranma could be a very dangerous opponent. Koryu,<br/>for the first time in many years, shivered a bit when he remembered that   it had taken him more than 4 weeks to get used to this style of fighting. Granted,<br/>he was small then, but still, that was not much of an excuse.<p>Koryu turned and vanished from the tree, heading back to the hotel to get some more sleep. He only came to watch Ranma this morning, to see his behavior after yesterday.<p>The conclusion?<p>He was well on his way to recovery. However, none of the conflicts he was going to face soon had been solved.<p>The new Ranma's life was just beginning.<p>Akane arrived at the breakfast table, yawning, while she covered her mouth with her left hand, kneeling to sit down next to Nabiki who was already there, surprisingly early. She had not slept well last night. Yesterday's events had been on her mind.<p>Luckily she had not run into Ukyo again. She had not seen Mr. Saotome all day yesterday either. She dreaded what he was cooking up in his tiny excuse of a mind.<p>She wanted to talk with Ranma. She felt she needed an apology for the way he acted yesterday. After all she had done for him. Additionally, she felt that she also owed him an apology as well.<p>She sighed, mainly because she had missed out on today's jog again.   She was a martial artist and needed to maintain discipline. She would start her   training tomorrow again.<p>Akane had done a lot of thinking yesterday. It was true that as he was insensitive, and a pervert at times. Sometimes, she felt, that she also had not considered his feelings. He did kill Saffron, to save her after all.<p>"Good Morning to you to sis" voiced an irked Nabiki. Akane turned to look at her.<p>Nabiki was looking at her with weary eyes.<p>"Good Morning Nabiki. How come you are up so early?" Akane inquired.<p>"Oh.. People to do... Stuff to meet." said Nabiki sleepily.<p>Akane's eyes bulged out, she didn't respond.<p>"What?" Nabiki asked irritatingly.<p>"Did you realize what you just said?"<p>"Yea.. People to d... oh.. whatever." Nabiki held her hand to her head and shrugged her shoulders.<p>Soun had promptly started the waterworks already, wailing about his daughter's   honor.<p>"Oh give it a rest daddy, or I might just think about sending you over to the  municipality in your old age. Your tears can provide lots of precious water all over   the country." threatened Nabiki. She had a headache coming.<p>"Surely you wouldn't do that to your own father, would you Nabiki?" Soun sobbed.<p>Kasumi walked in with a large tray in her hands, bringing food down to the table. She went in the kitchen to bring a couple extra dishes, and returned quite quickly.<p>"I will if you don't stop taking me seriously so early in the morning." came  the aggravated reply.<p>Everyone had started breakfast soon after that. Akane looked beside her and noticed  that Ranma hadn't arrived yet.<p>"Where's Ranma? Has he not woken up yet?"<p>The person in question casually walked into the room.<p>"Ranma, aren't you a little late today?"<p>"Sorry Kasumi, I was just enjoying a bath. Took too long I guess."<p>Akane looked at Ranma, nothing much looked different. He was just a   little more serious than usual. He didn't look as tired as he looked last night.<p>'Humph. He slept well while I was up most of the night worried.' she thought to herself.<p>"If you don't hurry, we're going to late for school... again!" said Akane. She didn't want to shout but she wanted to get to school on time. They were already in trouble for missing classes because of the whole Phoenix Mountain affair.<br/>"The hentai squad will also be there. I want to be there on time. You should to. We are in enough trouble as it is."<p>Ranma hadn't been paying much attention as he was rapidly finishing most of the food on the table.<p>He quickly turned around to Akane with a stuffed mouth.<p>"Don't worry I'll take care of them today." he said<p>"Ranma, please mind your manners. Don't speak with a mouth full." Kasumi reprimanded.<p>"Sorry Kasumi." Ranma said without swallowing.<p>Kasumi narrowed her eyes at Ranma.<p>He gulped down his mouthful. He didn't want to experience the same pain he believed Koryu went through yesterday.<p>"How many times do I have to remind you. I don't need your help Ranma! I can take care of them myself!" said Akane. She got up and headed to the door to put on her shoes.<p>"Its not because you can't. Its because I want to try something out today and I want some practice dummies." replied Ranma.<p>He quickly finished the bowl of rice he was eating and headed towards the door.<p>Before he got there. He turned around looked towards Kasumi.<p>"Thanks Kasumi, breakfast was great!"<p>Kasumi smiled back sweetly.<p>"Your welcome Ranma. Now don't any of you forget your bentos"<p>Nabiki also got up and started walking towards the door, after placing her bowl  down as Kasumi quickly walked into the kitchen to get the bentos. She handed them to   each person when she came back.<br/>Akane and Nabiki also thanked Kasumi and went off their way after Ranma.<p>As he ran on the fence, he recalled that incident with Koryu the other day. Damn, he so wanted to know how Koryu hid his presence so well. Well, first was the thing on his mind was to master Koryu's style of fighting. He would work on the presence part later.<p>Akane and Nabiki ran beside him. The trip to the school was surprisingly  quiet, Nabiki noticed. They normally used to be talking about something. Either that  or it was the usual daily arguments they had.<p>"What caused you to let out that massive ki blast yesterday Ranma?" asked Akane finally.<p>"I was annoyed. I think you know why." Replied the Saotome heir.<p>"Any idea where your father is Ranma?" she enquired again. She wanted to keep some sot of a conversation going.<p>"I don't know and I don't care."<p>"You know he's probably trying to do"<p>"Let him do what he wants. Instead of worrying, lets just wait for him to come back. We'll burn that bridge when we arrive to it."<p>That marked the end of the conversation as they could see the school coming up ahead.<p>"Got it Akane? I want to test something out. I have been training a little and I want to see if I can successfully work this through."<p>"Fine. Do whatever you want. I just don't to be late to class."<p>Ever since they had gotten back from China, Kuno and the goon squad attacked them with renewed energy. Apparently the news of the failed marriage hinted to them that Ranma indeed did not deserve Akane.<p>Ranma hopped down from the fence and doubled his running speed hoping to catch up to them as soon as possible. He had managed to do quite well in the morning, after Kasumi had left the dojo. While not perfected yet, Ranma believed that he had managed to get some sort of control over that style.<br/>He didn't know what to call it yet. Perhaps when he talked to Koryu next he would  ask.<p>'Here we go' he said to himself as he got closer to the crowd. Akane and Nabiki had been left behind as Ranma raced to the soon-to-be-fed-dirt group of Akane-maniacs.<p>He mentally noted to try and change his stance after every three or four  people to see if his practice in the morning paid off or not. The group of people was   just ahead of him now.<p>"Out of our way Ranma! You do not deserve Akane. Today we will succeed!"<p>Ranma didn't even bother replying with words, jumping at the first batch of  guys, carving his way through the crowd with open hand strikes. The guys that got  hit were sent flying, crashing into others. Three separate strikes had in fact taken down seven guys. There only eight more to go.   'Great, there goes my idea of switching stances. I need more of a challenge.' thought Ranma to himself.<p>He tried to implement the second stage of his training by weaving  through the group of people, appearing as if he was retreating, but in actuality  preparing for an attack. He struck them in open places where he knew they will  not get too hurt, yet hit them with such force to send them hurdling away. He ducked,<br/>swept, elbowed, kicked right his way through the remaining group of boys relatively  quickly.<p>After the fight, Ranma looked around and saw that the group of boys were  scattered all around. It seemed his training had some success. He smiled  in triumph as he noticed that, while this fight was slower, he had successfully been  able to send each and everyone flying away a much greater distance than they usually been.<p>He had executed the moves perfectly. However, he still thought he needed more practice, but the feeling he got while pushing his entire body was something he couldn't let go of.<p>He was breathing slightly heavily. He supposed the heavy workout in the morning was partly the reason for that.<p>"Foul Demon Saotome! Today the world shall understand true might, and thy shall only be given true, bitter defeat!" spewed the bokken wielding delirious raisin brained true blunder of Furinkan High.<p>Ranma stood his ground. On any other day, he would be as annoyed as it could be possible, to meet the Shakespearean reject. But today, was not any other day.<p>Behind him Akane and Nabiki had reached the school gates. Nabiki quickly ran over to her underlings that been waiting over by the side.<p>"Quickly. Make bets. We'll be betting that in a full fight against Kuno, Ranma will wipe him out within 2 seconds."<p>"But isn't that a little too quick if its gonna be a full fight?" one girl asked.<p>"No, this is probably going to be a full fight. But Ranma seems to be in the mood of fighting today." Nabiki quickly explained and motioned them to quickly follow her.<p>Akane stood at the gates, alone now. She saw Ranma wipe out the entire group of boys within five to ten seconds by himself. They literally been flying about.<p>She looked at Ranma, who was standing there, grinning like there was no tomorrow, his face towards Kuno.<p>Ranma was glad. His grin showed it. He needed a practice dummy, and got the best one there is. Besides, there was one more important thing he wanted to do today. His blood was boiling with anticipation.<p>"I'm glad I met you today Kuno. I am glad!" he said out loud, unable to contain his contentment.<p>"Oh? Then where is thy friend and his demon blade, that thy acquired through evil means to help take try and defeat me!"<p>'Friend?.. Sasuke' Like clockwork, Ranma understood what went on. He didn't expect anything else from the Kuno family. To think that he was worried about everyone finding about Koryu.<p>No one would belive Kuno. Ranma needed to have a talk with Sasuke. If he just talked and tried to figure out what Sasuke understood from that day, it would be quite easy to handle any kind of rumors that spread.<p>He knew he would have to deal with the old ghoul soon. He was surprised he not run into Shampoo already.<p>Koryu wanted to be kept a secret. This was not going to be as problematic as it initially looked like. Ranma made a point to tell Kasumi about this and ask her for help on the matter.<p>He supposed that if she taught Nabiki, she could easily help him solve this little problem out. Besides, it would give an excuse to spend more time with her. She also agreed to help him out with his studies, and grammar.<p>Good. 'Ok, think of that later Ranma, this is also going to be fun, wiping the school grounds with Kuno sounds cool right about now!' Ranma thought.<p>He deemed, for a second that he would rather think about doing anything with Kasumi than deal with Kuno, but it would still be quite fun telling her later today how he successfully implemented the fruits of his morning training.<p>"Kuno! I do not need anyone, nor any weapon to defeat you. I, Ranma Saotome, Heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes School of Martial Arts, challenge you to a duel, right here, right now!" Ranma shouted. His voice was deep and it almost echoed in every hall, every corridor of the school.<p>The wind blew only to emphasize the silence that had been cast all around the whole school. Ranma's hair and pig tail fluttered in it. His eyes were narrowed, his fists were clenched by his sides. Ranma Saotome was ready for a fight. This was no ordinary dual.<br/>This was his first dual since he had re-defined his honor. He not going to hold back seriously. He was going to show Kuno just what Saffron might have felt when they had fought.<p>"Then a duel thy shall get! Promise to relinquish the tigress Akane Tendo and the innocent pig tailed one when you loose. Show atleast some honor." spewed Kuno.<p>Ranma got a little upset at this.<p>"I do not own Akane, nor do I own the other. You know nothing of Honor Kuno! My honor cannot let you treat Akane like this. Should I beat you into an unforgiving position today, it is YOU who will leave Akane alone from now on!" Ranma roared.<p>"Try, evil cur!" shouted the Kendo champion.<p>The fight was on.<p>Kuno charged forward with tremendous acceleration, intent on sending his bokken straight through Ranma's head. It was unfortunate, however that he saw the pig tailed martial artist almost disappear from sight when he raised his bokken horizontally, to the right and thrust forward.<p>After hearing a loud crack, he at once felt the ground taken away from under his feet. He lost sight of the horizon and now was looking at the blue sky, brightly illuminated by the sun. A moment later he hit the ground hard, closing his eyes and raising his hand to shield from the power of the solar system's primary.   He looked to his left to see Ranma kneeling before him, a sharp pointed a wooden stick. It looked too much like the top part of his bokken to be a coincidence, but this is Kuno we're talking about, being pressed against his throat by Ranma's right hand.<p>When Kuno thrust forward, Ranma instantly weaved to the right, barely, but surely avoiding the bokken. He twisted to the left, pivoting on his right foot and bringing his right arm parallel to the bokken.       Grabbing the bokken in his right hand viciously breaking the top part of, Ranma transcended to the next phase by fluidly changing his stance, crouching low and performing a wide arc sweep under the Kuno Heir using his left foot.       He kept the momentum going while Kuno fell to the ground. By the time Kuno struck, Ranma had done a complete three-hundred-sixty and was now kneeling on Kuno's chest with his right knee, his left leg outstretched, holding the pointed edge of the broken 'stick' at Kuno's throat with his right hand.<br/>Everyone watching fight the was left speechless. This been the most elegant and swiftest way Ranma had disposed of Kuno in a proper duel, ever.<br/>Even Kuno wasn't saying anything. Though that was probably because of the fact that he hit his head too hard and was disoriented.<br/>"You loose. I have kept MY honor. Time to keep yours Kuno."<br/>Said Ranma in a dangerously controlled, serious voice.<p>His eyebrows were narrowed and he gave a look of intense power emanating from him. The same power that he utilized to destroy Saffron, King of Phoenix Mountain.<p>Ranma stood up, albeit slowly, and glared down at Kuno. He was not going to take things sitting down any more. He would no longer wait around and let people shove him around. Decisions to be made, would be made by him. He was going to take crap from no one.<p>This defeat of Kuno, no matter how insignificant, was another step for Ranma. He knew that in a few minutes from now Kuno would still drone on about his usual mindless drivel.   He knew that, there may be a chance that Kuno never does remove his filthy, deluded presence from his life.<p>Yet still, he felt happy. If not Kuno, the rest of people who witnessed this would be cautious, especially the mislead group of boys who were part cause of Akane's misconception regarding the male sex.<p>If she had to cool down, she needed the ever present chaos that surrounded her to be slowly removed. Maybe then she would understand when he broke the engagement, that it would be better to continue as friends and spend time away from each other.<p>That way they would not be get constantly pushed together by force, only to be driven apart, with bitter feelings.<p>Ranma knew that he himself was the greater part of chaos that surrounded her. He might even have to leave in order to take that away.<p>What was to come, would come. He did not know how he would deal with it yet. He did know however, that he would deal with by himself, with Kasumi's guidance whenever he might need or want it.<p>He stood proudly in the light. He cast one shadow that interfered with his own, away. The rest would come, and in time they would be cast away as well. How long that took, Ranma would never know. He assumed it would take a long while any ways.<p>There were still some conflicts within his own shadow that would cause problems. He would re-define his honor again.<p>He would resolve those conflicts.<p>He would only seek help from somebody he trusts completely. Only Kasumi, he believed, would help guide him to resolve his conflicts. He needed comfort and warmth. He regretted to admit it, but he did not remember his own mother providing that.<p>Ranma was always too worried about that bloody when she was around to feel warm with her presence.<p>No.<p>He would need Kasumi. She had also state, not with words, that she needed him. He would be there for her. He would be whatever she wanted him to be. If she so required, he would do anything to help her.   Her kindness had already become a big part of his life.<p>If not that, then she would be there and support him while he dealt with his conflicts.<p>Ranma stood there in silence for a few minutes, the barrage of emotions flooding through his body, pouring out from his soul. He then discarded the broken stick to the right, stepped over Kuno and slowly started towards school. He was late, he knew.<p>That was a trifle matter.<p>How noteworthy it was, Ranma didn't know nor did he care. But he had made a statement, and it was clear.<p>This was the new Ranma Saotome.<p>End of Chapter 5
