</div>Chapter 2: Koryu and Ranma. Similar Shadows Cast From Different Light.<p>Ranma woke up early next morning. A quick glance out the window let him view the glow of dawn begin to illuminate the horizon. He wondered if he should get up now that he awake. His father had not been awake yet, but then again the sake feast last night could have been something to do with it. What him and Mr. Tendo were had been celebrating left Ranma slightly disturbed. They had to be up to no good.<p>Ranma decided to lay back in his bed and let the events of last night continuously re-play themselves in his head. No matter what how much he wondered, he couldn't come to find a reason as to why he trusted Koryu so much. What had him more stooped were those images that had flashed in his mind when he had stared into Koryu's eyes last night.<p>The trust was nothing but gut instinct, only it was never this strong before. There was something about Koryu that just struck Ranma so hard that he couldn't imagine anything bad coming from the man.<p>He twisted around in bed and rested his arm over his forehead. This was probably wishful thinking on his part, he thought. Sometimes he had wished someone, a guy, maybe not a friend, but at least not an enemy, to be around.<br/>Now that it seemed possible, and Ranma had not gotten into a fight with Koryu yet, made Ranma feel as if maybe this person could be a friend; a real friend.<p>Koryu's gentle behavior as he conversed with Kasumi last night had not been lost on Ranma. He had been very straight forward and to the point, when Kasumi had started cleaning his wounds<p>and how straight forward he was in his behavior, but after they had gone up to Kasumi's room, which by the way was a first time for Ranma, so he was a bit nervous, they discussed his age and who he was.<p>Though a quiet person, when Koryu spoke, he was straight to the point. Ranma recollected Kasumi commenting on that and calling him a 'no-nonsense' person. Koryu smiled at that verbalizing something about his life forcing him to become that way.<p>He no wounds on his lower body, only on his arms and a few on his chest. When he took of his shirt, even Ranma was somewhat impressed at the built Koryu . It was hardly larger than Ranma' s own, but it was slightly more defined. Ranma shrugged it off because he three years to go to be Koryu's age. At that time even Ranma's body would be the same.<p>Kasumi a hard time addressing Koryu's wounds while maintaining a blush she could not seem to get rid of.<p>This gave Ranma a small insight on Koryu. It looked like Koryu also been training from a very young age. His movements showed grace and complete control. No wasted energy.<br/>It was almost relaxing, the conversation. It was quiet, even Kasumi felt so relaxed sitting there even when she told them they were the first boys to enter her room. Koryu refuted that with a smile telling her he was 21 years old, and considered himself a man. He even went on to say that from what he seen of Ranma, he was sure that Ranma, regardless of his age... was also as much of a man as he was.<p>Ranma, for once, didn't reply in arrogance when Koryu commented on how he immediately acted when possible trouble was up ahead. A man should at least be able to make immediate decisions in times of trouble.<p>Kasumi just smiled at that remark. Why did she smile so much, not that Ranma minded it of course. Her smiles was one of the things he considered a 'must-see' in ones life.<p>How it happened, he still couldn't fathom, but somehow even he completely felt relaxed in Koryu's company. The guy was simply comfortable to be with. It was as if he was a gentle but incredibly strong source of spiritual power that promised to keep everything safe.<p>Spiritual? Wait a second, he said something about sensing Ranma's ki. Maybe he should talk to Koryu about that later, when they would manage to sneak him out of the house.<p>Ranma sensed Akane and Nabiki entering the house compound, that meaning he would have to leave Kasumi's room in order to keep the suspicions to the lowest. It was hard, pinning down on exactly how he knew it was them. It could have been anyone. Previously he could sense someone close by, like within five to eight feet.<p>His range of detection increased its size by at least four times. This was, he imagined, because he was just getting stronger. Usually, he would have talked to Cologne about this, since his pops most probably not be able to understand. Ranma already surpassed his parent. Besides, he didn't want this aspect of his strength known yet. It prepared him for surprise attacks.<p>He gone downstairs, putting on the mask he kept on since the return from Phoenix Mountain.<p>A mask that used to be his previous personality. The arrogant, care free, stress bearing and sinfully simple personality. If no one else changed their attitude after the wedding, his change would only cause more problems. The fiancees were the same, only more 'vigilant' in trying to get his affections...<p>The worst of all was that Akane was the same. He would have still bared with it. He would still have continued if she shown some sort of understanding. He didn't want to spell it out for her. He stopped insulting her completely, seeing as words only caused problems between the two of them.<p>What Ranma slowly came to believe over the past few years was that Akane's attitude towards him somehow covered the feelings she for him. If that was so, then subsequent to his reduction of antagonistic remarks, she should have changed her outlook.<p>It certainly didn't seem so to him. She was generally better, no doubt. But she just didn't reach the bell when he required her to do so.<p>Petty jealousy.<p>Was Ranma something she was provided again by her father?<p>Was he some peace of meat?<p>Couldn't his perspective ever be brought into consideration?<p>After seeing what he done for her, what kind of pain he was going through for her, A simple kiss on the cheek or a hug from on of his other 'significant others' should NOT cause her to react like she did. If things were going to work, they to work now.<p>Ranma wasn't going to force them to work. He done his part. She needed to do hers. If she to be spoon fed everything, it would be a problem because he wasn't gonna do it.<p>Regardless of his flaws, he believed he earned some sort of relief from the visit to China. Seeing that no one chosen to appreciate or even consider his situation, he only came to one conclusion.<p>They were not worried about his feelings. So be it.<p>He would behave the same way except for the taunting. He was more quiet lately and Akane seemed to pay a little attention to that, but the next glomp from the Amazonian glomping champion only made her see red. The next verbal strike last Monday morning punctuated his decision to just forget about anyone ever learning.<p>He had learned, He tried to make himself better. They just didn't seem to care. It might still even work out, actually it most probably would. But if she wasn't going to take a step in response to his many, he wasn't going to bother.<p>It hurt him even more, that after everything that had happened, things were now gonna go for the worse. Well, at least he became a super strong martial artist. Though what a martial artist was, still eluded him.<p>In complete awe of the human mind, Ranma lay there in his bed,<br/>wondering how quickly these suppressed emotions had passed through his head  after he told Koryu last night of his decision, if Kasumi didn't mind,   that Koryu could stay for as long as it could be made possible, before   re-reaching the same conclusion to place his mask of in deference on.<p>He had gone down to greet the younger two offsprings of the tendo house hold and received a glare from Akane clearly telling him that she was still upset at the latest incident involving him and a certain spatula wielding chef who had just given him a kiss on the cheek as a way of saying good bye.<p>Not much had happened for the rest of the night. The Tendo and Saotome patriarchs had come in a little later, drooping their heads wondering what could be done about their master and his unhealthy fixation with women's under garments.<p>Actually, it was the opposite, wasn't it? The old man received energy from the under garments.<p>Kasumi had come down after a while, made dinner quickly, explaining that she had fallen asleep and forgot to prepare it earlier. Ranma was still amused with her look. If he wasn't actually there with her in the past hour, he would have believed her completely.<p>Though it was surprising behavior and Soun did start the water works, even Nabiki couldn't find anything suspicious. Well, that was what Ranma believed. He had seen the look on her face and it showed no tell tale signs of her suspecting something.<p>Besides, Kasumi's hair were also quite messed up and her face seemed slightly swollen... well not swollen but it looked as if she just got out of bed. How she managed to pull off that act perfectly still gave Ranma the shivers. She really was Nabiki's teacher.<p>A slight ruffling of fur brought Ranma back to the present. His pandafied father had finally decided to wake up and was preparing for the usual morning sparring session.<br/>It was more of a warm up exercise for Ranma now. He turned to his right, planting his hands firmly on the floor to for a solid base, and swiped his left leg swiftly and silently under his father's legs.   Mr. Baka-Panda found himself in air with no footing and looked down to see Ranma get on his right knee, retracting his left leg and sending a wicked kick to his chest sending him flying through the window and smashing into the Tendo compound wall.<p>'Hmm, I think I'm beginning to enjoy these morning two-step wipe out sessions.' Ranma thought to himself as he got out of bed for a little morning kata. Figuring his father would be out cold for a while, Ranma went straight to the Dojo.<br/>He was surprised to find the Dojo already having an occupant. What was more surprising was that he had not sensed him. Since his fight with Saffron, his senses seemed to have gone into overdrive. He would almost feel the presence of anyone within twenty feet of him at least in any direction.<p>Why couldn't he have sensed this man? The occupant turned around and greeted Ranma with a somber nod as he walked in, though his mirth broke out as he smiled at Ranma.<p>"That was a very interesting way to greet your father." said Koryu with a smirk.<p>"I thought ya needed ten to twelve hours of sleep. What are ya doin' here right now?" asked Ranma as he walked up to Koryu.<p>"I will go back to sleep in a bit. I never miss these early morning warm up sessions." replied Koryu as he got back into his stance to continue his kata.<p>Ranma watched him continue for a few minutes from the doorway. The moves, he realized were very, very precise and smooth. They were in fact quite similar to the Anything Goes style, but they seemed to be...<p>"Deadly..." said Koryu, finishing Ranma's thought process.<p>"Huh?" Ranma was speechless.<p>"I felt your confusion. I figured to just let you know, since you already are aware of my profession back home." Koryu smiled a bit.<p>"Yea...I guess, though it is still strange how each and every move you have is kinda aimed to cause serious destruction. So you are trained to kill huh? But you ain't killed no one yet."<p>"I have no intention of ever doing so either. Not unless I am left with absolutely no choice. I train every day just to make sure I am strong enough to continue my work without being forced into to taking a life."<p>"Thats good. You don't want that. Trust me, I know. Its ironic ain't it? You're like a trained killer, a commanding officer of a covert ops unit thingy, yet you never kill anyone. I am a martial artist always following the path of honor and protect the peopleI care for... yet all it has led me to become is a killer." murmured Ranma as he stared doing his own kata, steeling a few glances at Koryu while doing so.<p>"Life is full of irony." stated Koryu, continuing his Kata, not missing a beat. His movement gained and lost speed at a random pace. He changed forms quite quickly, just as he changed stances in many places, at apparently odd times.<p>"Aren't you going to ask me for a spar? I can almost feel your anticipation. You want to test yourself against me, don't you?" said Koryu, smirking again as he finished off his Kata and stood there, folding his arms.<p>"Naa...I'm...I'm.. I dunno.. I just dun wanna fight... not after." Ranma's face lost its concentration as he just followed through his moves with no emotion at all. As if he was a robot programmed to go through them.<p>This seemed to have touched a nerve on Koryu as he narrowed his eyes toward's Ranma. "Ranma, too chicken to fight me? Scared you will hurt me bad.. or kill me? Or after your experience, you are too chicken to fight anymore." he said.<p>Ranma stopped his kata and looked to refute him for a second, but stopped pre-maturely.<p>"I ain't the same anymore. I always get baited into fights, my pride and arrogance has got me into too much crap already." he stated as he moved to get to his moves again.<p>Koryu had a grin creeping onto his face. This kid was growing up, well believing that you killed someone is a severe enough trauma to get anyone to wake up from their life.<p>There were times where one should protect their pride, there were also times where ignoring pride to see the situation clearly, led to a new sense of pride and dignity.<p>"Hey dude, listen up. I owe you and Kasumi for your kindness towards me. Just like you, I live by the code of honor. I will stay here and repay your kindness by helping you and Kasumi out. Just so you know, I am not just a covert operative. I am a Ninja, from one of the ancient and most deadly clans. Believe me when I say this, you don't need to worry about hurting or killing me." rattled off Koryu, flexing his muscles.<p>He was beginning to like Ranma.<p>Though Ranma reminded him of himself several years ago...   Ranma was his own person and that made things much more interesting. Ranma glanced at Koryu for a second, wondering what to do, when he got an idea.<p>"Fine, I'll spar with you. On a condition though, there's something I wanna ask ya."<p>"Yea yea.. I would have answered your questions any ways, but geez man, you are making it sound as if I am the one begging for a spar and not you." Koryu said , a sweat drop appearing on his forehead.<p>"Fine. Lets go." Ranma got into his stance, turning to face Koryu.<p>After a moment's silence, in which they both sized each other up, the floor board squeaked angrily as they immediately dashed into each other at incredibly fast speeds.<p>The fight lasted for fifteen minutes as both fought with incredible reflexes. Neither seemed to get the upper hand and both seemed to have smiles on their faces.   Ranma, after his initial first few trade of blows, learned that Koryu was in fact a very high class fighter. Slowly, his fear of inflicting pain or killing dissolved into pure enjoyment as they continued the fight.<p>No anger.<p>No sadness.<p>No frustration.<p>No fight for life or death, or to save a fiancee from anyone or anything. It was just a fight between two people who enjoyed the art of un-armed combat.<p>It was a sport that invigorated Ranma.<p>He had been tagged several times and though he was getting the feeling that Koryu could seriously kick his ass if he wanted to, he was really beginning to relish the fight.<p>There weren't any concentrated attacks in any one place. It was a varied fight. Sweeping, ducking, kicking, punching and even reverse elbowing took place. It went all the way to flying kicks and reverse flip kicks. All the advanced forms of hand to hand combat took part in this fight. No ki based attacks were involved.<p>During the fight, Ranma started to get a little frustrated at the fact that he was not being able to get in any tags. He knew he was very fast but Koryu had matched his speed in every move. Ranma noticed something odd about Koryu's moves.<p>He couldn't put a finger on it until he reeled in pain after receiving a straight kick, it had blew right through his guard.<br/>Koryu was acting as a mirror. He was reversing everything that was thrown towards him in similar fashion. Ranma got up from the ground as he faced Koryu again.<p>"You are... tr-" Ranma began, through clenched teeth.<p>"This is a fight! Don't insult it by talking!" shouted Koryu, successfully cutting Ranma off.<p>Ranma didn't wait long after that. He immediately increased the pressure on his ankles, knees and thighs as he pushed with all his might, begging his legs to get to Koryu before he was ready.<p>It didn't work. Koryu was waiting with a smile.<p>If someone was watching, they would not have been able to do anything but stare in awe of the supreme level of this battle that took place between the two warriors.<p>As all good things come to an end, the two stopped after they took their first break after fifteen minutes of continuous sparring. They both, at the same time had sensed Kasumi getting up, and moving about in her room.<p>"Oh yea... about what I wanted to ask you. You were blabbering   about some spiritual crap yesterday and it just caught my attention. Since  my fight with Saffron, I've been able to-"<p>"You fought Saffron?" said Koryu, cutting Ranma in mid sentence.<p>"Uh.. yea.. you know him from your world or something?"<p>"Don't tell me he's the guy you 'killed'."<p>"Um... yea. I used a focused Hiryu Shoten Ha, freezing him. I uh.. had to do it. Akane's life was in danger." Ranma, looking down for a second.<br/>"any ways, what I'm trying to say is that, since then, I can sense anyone in about fifteen to twenty feet. You were the only one I couldn't sense. My fighting abilities, as I just kinda realized, have gotten even better. I move faster, sharper and more fluently. Also, I trust you. Ain't that wierd man?   I know this is gonna be wierd but ever since last night when I looked in your eyes,   I had a feeling that you were tellin' the truth. It was as if, I could feel the honesty reeking from you." said Ranma quickly... getting it out of the way.<p>He felt a bit like a fool. But why he seemed to trust Koryu so blindly was seriously getting to him. He had no rational reason, but it felt as if he didn't need one.<p>"Well I'll be damned Ranma. I am impressed." said Koryu after a moments thought. His eyes were narrowed and his arms were folded across his chest as he looked at Ranma with newfound respect.<p>"eh?. with that? The fight? I didn't touch ya"<p>"No you idiot" Ranma cringed at that, as Koryu continued. "Damn, I was  just thinking that you were a trusting person, even if your past life has told  you nothing but to not trust anything obscure that came your way. You read my mind  through my eyes! I truly am impressed!"<p>"I uh.. read your mind? Through your eyes?" Ranma was thoroughly confused.<p>"Its not that simple. Its an ancient technique many old, hardened warriors  used to see if someone was lying or not. They looked at the eyes, as the eyes are  said to be the connection to your soul. That, of course is a load of crap, but a   supremely more advanced technique allows you to look into the other person's mind   or soul, and instantly receive memories, or feelings. Its complicated and well...   you are the first person I have met that has managed to do it on his own!" explained   Koryu.<p>Ranma took in a deep breath as he tried to understand Koryu's words.<p>"Perhaps we should sit down" suggested Koryu as Ranma agreed by going down to his knees, placing his hands on his thighs, looking intently at Koryu. Koryu reflected Ranma. His body had started aching again due to his injuries but this was something that seemed important to Ranma.<p>As was his usual trait, ironically the same as Ranma's, Koryu was more concerned with someone else's problem's rather than his own.<p>"I know Saffron on my world" Koryu started slowly, hoping to give Ranma a quick and easy explanation of the changes Ranma seemed to have been going through in the past week or two.<p>"So I know his fighting abilities. Plus I also read your memories when   I looked into your eyes last night so... I guess we're even then. I had to do so  to make sure you were also honest and were not going to cause problems for me or  anyone else. " Koryu stopped, letting that sink into Ranma<p>Ranma remembered Koryu's fierce eyes when he first looked at him.<p>"Anyways..." Koryu continued after a moment's silence "I didn't get   everything, but I did get some of your past and your present feelings. I didn't   look into the details, as I did not want to invade too much into your privacy,<br/>I did get some of your fighting methods and thought processes, including emotions."<p>Ranma nodded quickly, closing his eyes, indicating that it was water under the bridge.<p>"You and I are very much alike Ranma." stated Koryu quietly." We are like   two similar shadows from a different light. You have had a lot of Ki based fights,   in your past and you have learned... to learn new things incredibly fast. You   are an adaptive fighter, just like me. Though, after you have been using ki heavily   in fights, it has forced your body to enhance your spiritual nature which includes   harnessing, focussing and using ki in any way. After all, Ki is nothing much more   than the power of your spirit."<p>"So that means my body has forced itself to become some sorta super ki using  machine?" said Ranma quickly, snapping his fingers.<p>Koryu narrowed his eye brows at Ranma's choice or words. "Can I ask you  one thing Ranma, if I may? Can you please not refer to machines. That correlation  tends to get on my nerves." he stated.<p>"umm yea.. sure. I guess." Ranma agreed.<p>"Anyways, you know when you suffer a trauma , or if your are in trouble, sometimes the human body can do unimaginable things. You seem to been in that situation since you were a child. Especially after the neko-ken training... uh yea... I felt your emotions about that and I do know of that training method."<p>Kasumi chose that moment to walk in as she looked at the two people sitting opposite each other. "Oh my, here you are... I was wondering if you had left already." she said with a smile.<p>"Naa. Kasumi-san...I'm gonna stay here for a while and help you and Ranma out for a while in a way of saying thanks for your kindness." said Koryu politely with gentle nod towards her.<p>"Oh that wouldn't be necessary. I'm just glad we could help you." Kasumi replied.<p>"Hey Kasumi, wanna sit down? Koryu's tellin' me somethin' about myself that I hadn't known. Some changes about me." Ranma offered, not wanting to ignore her again, it being something done many times previously.<p>"Changes? I-I think I have a little time to spare, breakfast is almost ready so yes... I suppose I can... if I'm not disturbing you that is." replied Kasumi. She was a little nervous, not wanting to impose on the two men in front of her.<p>"Actually, I would be happy if you sat down with us. It would be more comfortable sharing with someone instead of keeping it to myself again." said Ranma looking at her with a smile. A genuine smile that hadn't really been on his face for a while, a smile that reached his eyes.<p>Koryu noticed this and perked an eyebrow and hid a smile that he had half the mind to let show.<p>"Oh and please Koryu-san, you can call me Kasumi please. It feels strange being called Kasumi-san from you." Kasumi said looking at Koryu.<p>Koryu grinned at that showing his teeth.<p>"Sure, Kasumi-chan."<p>Kasumi held a one sided smile at Koryu as she sat down next to Ranma. She quickly glanced at Ranma for a second before turning to look at Koryu again.<p>In the next few minutes Koryu re-iterated what he had explained to Kasumi quickly so she knew what was going on.<p>"Now..where we left off. Ranma, last night, when you looked into my eyes, you were subconsciously looking for answers, your body, mind, again forced you to delve into my eyes and soul. I guess at the time, I was myself was being straight forward. That was the only emotion, feeling or state of mind I had. I was being honest. That's why I guess you seemed to trust me. You seem to trust your sixth sense.<p>"It hasn't failed me yet... well when I'm dealing with anything relating to danger anyways." said Ranma. He turned towards Kasumi. "You missed our fight Kasumi. It was amazing. I was like in an even better shape than ever before. Its like I was on overdrive." He told her.<p>He had this gleam in his eye. The gleam that she had thought would probably never come back after what she witnessed of Ranma's emotions yesterday.<p>Ranma was coming back. Somehow, she felt relaxed...happy.<p>"Ack! I got to go get breakfast. Everyone should be getting ready to come back down to breakfast now." Kasumi hastily got up and scampered back to the kitchen.<p>"Ack?" Ranma looked at where Kasumi was sitting.<p>"Hmm? What about it. I thought she looked really quite, behaving  about that." said Koryu<p>"You don't know about this do you? I guess you should read the rest of my mind. That'll save quite some time." Ranma said.<p>"You sure about that punk? I don't want to cause problems."<p>"I don't mind. Besides, it will save you a lot of problems. Sasuke will probably tell Kuno and the rest of the gang will know about you so its best you know about them before the come down and start causing a havoc. Frankly I cant be bothered to fight them any more. Its always one thing or another."<p>Koryu gave Ranma an inquisitive look, before answering. "No, its quite alright. I think I'll learn the normal way. Besides, I already know about your fiancee problem. Chill dude. I told ya... I'm gonna be here to help. I ain't gonna cause any more problems... hopefully that is."<p>Koryu got up and walked over to the door and was about to walk through but stopped as one thing went through is mind.<p>"Ranma." he said<p>Ranma looked toward him as he got up. "What?"<p>"Remember when I said you and I are alike Ranma? I meant it. We are  truly alike. We both live by the code of honor. The only difference is that you  live under more than one Shadows of Honor."<p>"Shadows of Honor?"<p>"You protected someone you cared for. If that meant you have to kill Saffron, who by the way isn't really dead, if you froze him. He can be killed, this one time... he wasn't. He is a human phoenix, Ranma. He expended all his energy and returned to his infant form. Just like the legendary Phoenix that rises from its own ashes. But you should-" Koryu stopped upon hearing a soft thud, turning around to investigate.<p>Ranma got down on his knees, already crying, his hands on the ground, balled into fists.<p>Koryu stood there, looking at the man. 'We are so alike Ranma...so much alike that it hurts. I've been there right where you are now.' he thought to himself.<p>"Ranma breakfast's ready. Umm Father and every-" Kasumi stopped mid-sentence when she saw Ranma shivering.<p>"Ranma...what's wrong!" She ran quickly to him. Not knowing what to do she did what she knew had worked yesterday. Not wasting any time in wrapping him up in her arms resting his head on her shoulder.<p>Behind her Koryu stood there... watching the scene take place with an expression with upmost gravity.<p>"He found out Saffron didn't really die. He has just reverted to an egg, retaining all his memories." Koryu said in a monotone.<p>"How?" Kasumi said, slightly exasperated, who was now rocking Ranma in her arms trying to get him to control himself.<p>"I told him." replied Koryu. "I know about Saffron. He exists on my world. Though he isn't as much of a prick there as he is here."<p>"Why didn't you tell him earlier?" Kasumi asked, looking Koryu  with shock<p>"That is because he needed to know, he needed to believe it. He has to understand the feeling, when you truly believe you took another being's life. When you understand...the in explainable phenomenon known as 'death', what it means when someone dies... when you experience it...only then can you sometimes really understand what is important in life. If I told him before our spar today. He would not have healed."<p>They stood there for a while as Ranma sat there in Kasumi's arms crying tears of happiness. He wasn't a killer. That was the only thought going through his mind.<p>"Kasumi-chan, It has to hurt... if it has to heal...He will recover... and he will become stronger. He will finally break the flaws that the people around him have instilled in him. But he needed this to do so. I should know. I've been through this before." said Koryu quietly.<p>"Its ok Ranma, you can let it out... its great news though, isn't it?"<p>Koryu was about to walk out when he heard Ranma speak, in a voice that someone would have heard they would never have have believed it to belong to the pig tailed martial artist.<p>"Men don't cry damnit!" he croaked out.<p>Koryu stopped dead. "And why is that Ranma?"<p>"Pop always said that... men don't cry."<p>"I guess we'll have a talk about that later on. Ranma, if you trust me, trust this. You are no less a man for letting out emotions by crying. in fact, you are a man in doing so. You are facing your emotions and letting them out. One tends to become a little weak in the mind when he or she is in this state. That is why it is a rule never to show fear or emotions in front of people. It shows weakness. But there is nothing wrong in showing emotions to someone you trust, or who you know will not take advantage of you. As far as I know, only Kasumi fill's that position, and she seems most willing to do so."<p>With that Koryu walked out of the room, heading straight up to Kasumi's room,walked into his corner, and closed his eyes, willingly drifting off to sleep.<p>Downstairs, Ranma had somewhat recovered as he was sitting quietly, still in Kasumi's arms. For some reason he didn't want to move.<p>"Ranma, look I'm gonna have to go to the kitchen, I don't and im certain you don't want any more problems... so I guess I'll see you later then ok? We'll discuss this later on. Alright?" Kasumi spoke in a gentle voice, as she slowy let go of the recovering martial artist.<p>Kasumi quickly made her way to the door of the dojo. She turned around to see that Ranma had already gotten up slowly from the floor and was standing straight with his fists clenched. His eyes, shone in the morning sunlight that was filtering in. Those steel blue eyes, they had a different look to them.<p>She didn't know what happened, but she did notice that Ranma had somehow, in the last few minutes...changed.<p>She gasped when she saw his trade mark smirk appear on his face. It was the same smirk, it was the same face, but somehow, he looked like a new person. His face no longer seemed to show arrogance.<p>It showed confidence, and power. He looked simply... Kasumi halted her thought as she simple smiled back and ran through the door so fast, Ranma thought she'd learned how to teleport.<p>In the kitchen she sighed while quickly gathering everything when she heard people in the house stirring and coming down to breakfast.<p>"Oh god he's gorgeous." she thought to herself,wondering what had happened that made him look even sexier than he used to before. And then Koryu's words hit her.<p>She quickly went to the sink and dowsed her face in cold water. 'Wake up Kasumi!' she thought to herself. She had never let physical looks falter her before. That was why she had even declined becoming engaged to Ranma in the first place when the Saotome's came the first time. He was a boy then... but the look just now.<p>It didn't belong to a boy. In front of her eyes, Ranma had grown up. Is that  possible? In a few minutes? But no.. it wasn't was it. For Ranma, it had been the last several years or more. All those years of pent up emotions, and his personal honor restored...Ranma grew up.<p>He was now a man. And a damn hot one to!<p>A smile grew on Kasumi's face as she gathered all the food in a tray and   proceeded to her family where she served them. Right now Ranma needed someone to   trust, and she would be that person.<p>No matter what, his looks would come secondary, and so would physical attraction. Besides she was older than him. She didn't know if he could ever look at her that way. 'Oh well, lets just do what I can for him. I am right now the only girl he will really trust, and I truly want him to be happy, for his sake only.' She said to her self.<p>Well, a girl can dream can't she?<p>End Chapter 2
