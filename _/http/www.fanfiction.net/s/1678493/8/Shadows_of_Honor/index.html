</div>Chapter 8:Precious Morning, Rise To Strength of Change<p>It was eleven o'clock at night. The Tendo compound was quiet;<br/>Nabiki Tendo sat on her bed, cross legged again, pondering on what had transpired in the last few days. It started when, yeah, Saturday morning whilst Kasumi started openly making comments towards Beevis and Butthead, driving back their rampage about Ranma and Akane and the usual drivel. Kasumi's behavior was not too unexpected.<p>Ranma had started to show a bit of a backbone towards Akane, it looked as if he was sick and tired. His behavior, though also not unexpected, was a small surprise. After what he had been through, it was only a matter of time.<p>Akane needed to tread carefully now, Nabiki thought. Even if she did care for Ranma, her general attitude did not look appeasing to the now aggravated martial artist.<p>He had taken Kuno out in a proper duel, and in less than two seconds no less! It had taken half an hour for Kuno to get to his senses after his diabolical performance against Ranma, well whatever sense he had in the first place. 'Not much' though Nabiki.<p>Akane had said something about a hole in the ground to Nabiki, when she was inquired about knowing anything regarding Ranma's sudden explosive power. She didn't say much else, and continued eating her lunch, totally oblivious to the questions her friends and classmates were asking regarding her relationship with Ranma. Nabiki wasn't the only one curious about Ranma and his actions in the morning.<p>'A hole in the ground. Yeah, like that tells me a whole lot' Nabiki thought. Ranma had the ability to make lots of holes in the ground. Maybe it was Nabiki's ignorance in the matter, but she had a feeling that that did not answer the questions that currently, were having a game of volleyball in her head using her brain.<p>She needed answers... well not really. Up until now, Nabiki had always wanted answers, never really needed them. Answers helped her making money. She had become quite a quick, solid judge of character and used that ability to predict what would happen. It had come in quite helpful, like this morning with Ranma and that bet on beating Kuno in less than two seconds. She just wished she had more time before the fight had started.<p>She had raked in quite a bit of money regardless.<p>In the end, everything came back to Kasumi. Kasumi was up to something. Whatever it was, Nabiki knew not to doubt it, but she still wanted to know what the hell was going on.<p>She had become used to predicting situations, and now really felt uncomfortable when she didn't know what was happening.<p>Making up her mind, Nabiki got up from bed and walked right out of her room. She knew Kasumi and Ranma were in Kasumi's room still. She had wanted to sneek in, but she knew that nothing really interesting would be found, apart from them studying.<p>She decided, after brooding for a moment, that sneaking wouldn't even be a prudent idea. This idea was especially bad because Ranma could easily detect her attempted intrusion. She thought to just knock on the door and come up with something on the spot. She always was good at being lucrative when needed.<p>As she walked up to the door and raised her arm, clenching her knuckes, clamping her eyes shut, Nabiki held back her fist just inches from the door, and thought for a moment.<p>'Why? Must I know what she's doing? This is the first time since the high school dance that Kasumi decided to do something and here I am trying to be nosy about it?' Nabiki thought.<p>The next five minutes she stood there, fighting a war with two parts of her mind, one that wanted to find out and the other that wanted to leave her elder sister alone.<p>The latter won; Nabiki sighed in defeat and slowly slumped back to her room. She would trust her elder sister. If she needed anything, Nabiki knew she would come for help. She had come before. This time, Nabiki wouldn't even charge anything. If it helped reduce the constant chaos, no problem at all. Besides, today's winnings were exceedingly good.<p>Before going to bed, Nabiki made a mental note to try and talk to Akane; try to see if that girl will change her behavior around Ranma. If she doesn't, she could be in a for a lot of hurt, and not necessarily physical.<p>Kasumi felt warm, yet slightly chilly at the same time. As she slowly, but reluctantly came to consciousness, she felt heat emenating from her bed, but didn't want to question it. Her warm, firm pillow warmed her face. On her back were two strong bars held on either side, attached to the pillow, warming her even more. The slight chilliness she felt was infact quite pleasant as it came nothing compared to the warmth being radiated by her bed, pillow and bars.<br/>Kasumi exhaled a deep breath and tried to snuggle closer, leaning slightly to the side in the process, having something hard knock onto her head.<p>The wall?<p>Kasumi woke up with a start, her sudden movement waking her sleeping companion as well. 'huh? Oh, how nice. Just a dream.' Kasumi's thought frose as she processed the current situation; she was looking at Ranma wearing a startled look, who's face was just inches from hers.<p>They were in a very compromising position. Kasumi was almost on top of Ranma and had her head resting on his chest when it decided to slip off and hit the wall. At least thats what she felt happened.<p>"Wha.. whya? .. Oh.. crap."<p>Ranma woke when he felt some quick movement very close to him; too close for comfort. He opened his eyes and slowly realized that Kasumi was in his arms.<p>He felt his stomach go cold. The freezing reaction spread from his stomach to different parts of his body rather quickly as he found himself believing that he was the most despicable person on the entire planet to ever put Kasumi in such a peculiar situation.<p>"Oh My!"<p>Kasumi quickly disentangled herself, very embarrassed and her red face betrayed it; the room light had not been switched off last night. When Kasumi started moving again, Ranma immediately mirrored her actions, dis-entangling himself from her. They had been wrapped up good in each other's limbs. When they weren't so near to each other, Ranma at once went into a deep bow, causing the floor to 'thump' in response.<p>He was on his knees; his head touching the ground, and was profusely apologizing and begging for forgiveness.<p>"Oh god, I am so sorry, I swear I did not mean for anything like that to happen. You can do whatever you want to punish me, I swear I will take any form of punishment..." He began in a frenzy.<p>When Kasumi recovered slightly, she looked at Ranma and realized what he was doing. Her initial embarrased and surprised feeling faded away gradually and last night's events came rushing to her mind.<p>She had just asked for him to hold her for a bit longer. She must have fallen asleep, and from the looks of it, so did Ranma.<p>"Ranma-kun, Ranma-kun!" Kasumi tried to bring Ranma out of his eternally-willing-to-take-punishment mode. When that didn't work Kasumi decided to go straight to the counter measure two.<p>She pulled his left ear hard and looked straight into his eyes to get his attention. He winced for a second but became quiet, leaning a little to his left side, Kasumi's right, in an effort to reduce the pain instigating from his ear.<p>"Now, quit your babbling and listen to me! Got it?" Kasumi said a little forcefully, giving Ranma a glare.<p>Ranma nodded twice, quickly.<p>"Good, now Ranma, there is nothing to worry about. Actually, what I want to say is... Thank you." Kasumi's face softened.<p>Ranma thought that something had gone wrong with his ear.<p>"Huh?"<p>"Its alright, I just want to say...Thank you." Kasumi repeated softly and gently.<p>"You're not mad?" Ranma asked. Something must be really really wrong, he thought.<p>"No Ranma...quite the opposite. I am happy. I couldn't have wished for anything more."<p>Ranma's utterly blank face gave Kasumi the impression that Ranma was moving from dumbfounded ness to complete bewilderment.<p>"Look, Ranma. Please clear your mind and listen carefully. If you remember,<br/>last night I asked you to just hold me, and you did. I felt very relaxed, and   either because I was quite tired or slightly too relaxed, I appeared to have   fallen asleep in your arms. It looks to me that you must have fallen asleep your self  not wanting to disturb me. That is all that happened. How we got into this position,"   Kasumi pointed to the place where they had been laying, " is ...well we were sleeping.   There is nothing wrong at all. So you are excused."<p>Ranma took in what she said but still felt something wasn't right.<br/>He shook his head slowly and spoke with a resolute voice.<p>"No.. there is no excuse. I have no excuse to do that to you."<p>"Ranma, we were sleeping. Who has any control over sleep?" Kasumi frowned.<p>"Still...NO! I'm a goddamn idiot! I can't.." Ranma looked away.<p>"Ranma!" Kasumi pulled at his ear a bit again, getting his attention for the second time. When he looked back, he saw her looking at him with not an angry expression but a slightly surprised one that, little by little, split into a genuinely happy one.<p>"Ranma...again...thank you." She whispered with a smile.<p>"For what?" The freaked boy asked incredulously.<p>"For this." She whispered again.<p>Ranma's entire face contorted with misunderstanding.<p>"HUH?" Ranma was getting the feeling something was wrong with Kasumi.<p>Kasumi sighed and smiled even more.<p>"Ranma, this... your reaction. Its so obvious that you are so worried about what might situation I might be in, you have totally forgotton about your self. Look at you, you are freaking out. That certainly lets me know you have not done anything...that we have not done anything wrong. Nor would you ever do so. I can see it in your face."<p>Ranma visibly relaxed a bit at her words and gentle soothing, allowing her to continue. His hands had left the floor and went to his lap as he was still kneeling.<p>"So, earlier I thanked you for holding me last night. I haven't slept  this well in... well... since my mother had died. The second time I said thank you  was because of your natural reaction right now. You were so worried for me that you  were willing to take any punishment. I'll be honest with you. After hearing and  looking at your reaction, Ranma, you are the only person I would willingly spend the  night with. I know, that you would never do anything to put me in an uncomfortable  situation. You have no idea how pleasant I feel, having that knowledge."<p>Ranma's balled his right hand into a fist and placed it over his heart.<p>"I would rather commit seppuku for even thinking doing anythin' wrong to ya!" Ranma said with a dead seriousness that shook Kasumi to the core.<p>Were those tears in his eyes?<p>Was he that scared? Sure he was. He was scared of driving the only person  that had really meant something to him as a friend. He had only received her   friendship two days ago. He feared loosing it so soon. It was, Kasumi imagined,<br/>something he wouldn't be able to handle.<p>Fear of being alone again.<p>'Oh Ranma, I was wrong. You aren't a diamond. You are so, so much more precious.' Kasumi thought to herself.<p>She smiled and leaned forward to kiss him on the cheek. Ranma stayed there,<br/>frozen in place after the kiss. He had tried to move away initially, but unfortionately   or fortunately, depends on which way one thinks, Kasumi hand't let go of his ear yet.<p>"And I'll say it again. Thank you. You really are a true friend. You are the friend that I have always yearned for." Kasumi whispered. "So please get those self depreciative thoughts out of your honorable head." Kasumi smiled, gently letting go of his ear.<p>Kasumi sighed, looking out the window, before speaking again.<p>"Now Ranma, I believe... it is early morning. I guess we woke up   just when it is time for you to go for your morning exercise... isn't it?" Kasumi  looked at the horizon. There was a reddish glow, indicating the oncoming day.<p>"Uh.. yea. I guess I'll go to the bathroom... I'll be down in the dojo then." Ranma said a little nervously. He had recovered, but it was taking time.<p>Kasumi didn't blame him. He was still a little shaken. Heck, she was still a little shaken. He had looked so sensual in the morning sleepiness, felt so warm. She almost didn't want to get out of that position.<p>Kasumi tied up and tossed those thoughts into a tightly closed room in her mind for a later time. The problem was, she was also scared. She didn't want to cause any misunderstandings, who knows what would have happened if someone had walked in on them?<p>She, got up from the floor knowing that she needed to start preparation for break fast soon. Ranma had just left her room, maybe she could just watch him practice until it was time to make breakfast.<p>Settling on that course of action, Kasumi decided to change her clothes, as they were crumply since she had slept in them last night.<p>Ranma, in the toilet, washed his face with cold water, instantly transforming  into a girl. That was an encounter he never wanted to go through again. Well, not that he'd mind, but with Kasumi? He at first thought that Kasumi would hate him. She would probably never speak to him again.<p>She just kept on surprising him with her behavior. If this was Akane, he would have been sent to the moon. Permanently.<p>Ranma frowned at the thought of Akane. The memories of his talk with Kasumi last night came back as he mulled over why that girl just thought that each action from a boy was perverted.<p>If that was so, then why the hell didn't she ever think Ryoga was a pervert! He really WAS the pervert. But nooo, Akane just believed that what she thinks is right, is right. What does she know about perverts?<p>Not wanting to ruin his mood, Ranma removed those thoughts from his mind completely and proceeded with his morning business. When he was done, and was washing his hands, a soft knock came on the door followed by a feminine voice.<p>"Ranma, are you in there?"<p>"Yea, sorry Kasumi, I'm done now."<p>Ranma left the room after quickly putting on his gi, which he had found hanging next to the washing machine.<p>On his way out, he saw Kasumi smile sweetly at him, patting him on the shoulder. "I'll be down in a few minutes. Since I am awake and if you don't mind, I'd like to watch you practice."<br/>"Uh? Yea sure Kasumi, I don't mind. It'll be cool." Ranma returned with a smile as Kasumi went in to the toilet.<p>On his way down to the stairs Ranma took deep several breaths. His heart was still pounding against his chest, as if it was trying to break out. By the time he arrived to the dojo, his mind and body had, thankfully, relaxed considerably.<p>He got into his stance, preparing for a warm up, and realized something was wrong. He felt shorter; he was a she. How could he have done that? Totally forgot? He even changed into the gi. He even talked to Kasumi, how could he not even notice the change in voice?<p>Man, this morning was starting wierd. Hopefully this wasn't an omen of things to come.<p>Ranma-chan sighed.<p>Not wanting to think as to what might have gone wrong he just started his warm up kata, moving slowly and visualizing the entire sequence in his mind. He wasn't using Koryu's style yet. He was still just currently trying to warm up his ( her ) body. Using that technique needed an active body and it would be best to try it after being warmed up.<p>While he warmed up, Ranmas mind went back to the spar between him and Koryu.<br/>Ranma tried to consider how Koryu managed leave the floor undamaged in their previous   fight. None of the floorboards were even scratched from Koryu's execution. That meant   that Koryu used ki or whatever spirit...but wait... he said it was the same thing... almost.<p>Anyways, it looked like he used ki very deftly. Wait! Deftly. That's it! He was adept at using ki on a smaller scale. Since he's probably been using this method of fighting for a long time, Koryu has become really damn good at using ki efficiently enough not to damage the floor... no but wait.<p>If Koryu used a small amount of Ki infusion then he wouldn't be able   to stop with his movements without becoming unbalanced, unless he used some  immense strength to stop. Maybe he did that to train. He would need more ki   if he didn't want to cause too much strain on his muscular or skeletal structure.   That style was very self destructive, if used without much ki infusion. If Ranma became   proficient at that style with out ki infusion, then when he DID use ki, he would be more than twice as strong. It was a good way to develop the body and increase the effectiveness of the ki he harnessed.<p>Ranma finished the warm up kata and turned around to face the other way.<p>He then did the same kata again, at a significantly faster pace. He needed to be really warmed up today. In his head, the mental commentary continued.<p>'Now onto the part where Koryu uses his ki. If he was using ki in his attacks, then the ground shoulda been destroyed. That means that he is somehow not letting the ground get busted while he moves. That means he is somehow either not using ki so powerfully or he is somehow making the ground harder. Ground harder? Yea! You can channel your ki into different things like weapons. Why can't anyone channel it into the ground. But that means you need to use even more ki. It also means that I need a really strong control over my ki. Damn.' Ranma concluded.<p>That would be difficult... He had a strong ki. But Ranma did not have a strong control over it. This would take longer than he had originally thought. What he needed to do was to try and do katas with that style and try and use as little ki as possible.<br/>Ranma had spent all his time either holding back all his ki ki to use with the Soul of Ice, or channeling all of his ki into his attacks. He's never controlled any specific amount. He was going to have to re-learn of ki channeling in order to control the amount and intensity.<p>That was the difference between Ranma and Koryu, Ranma relied on power and strength. Koryu, while very strong, managed to use each and ever ounce of strength, whether it was ki based or muscle based, to maximum effect. They were contrasting fighters, like opposites. This also explained Koryu's deadly attacks. He had so much control over his ki that he could mask it; that also explained why Ranma couldn't sense Koryu.<p>The more he was able to use small amounts of ki, the better he would be able to control it. He had no idea if this was in fact true but it was better than nothing. If Ranma could control small amounts of ki, when when he was able to use larger amounts, he would become much more powerful than he currently was! This was somewhat similar to the Soul of Ice technique, but on a totally different scale.<br/>Ranma came to the conclusion that he wasted too much ki on a general scale, he needed to start controlling it much, much better so that he could progress to a higher level.<p>Having a plan, Ranma set out to train with more vigor. Totally ignorant of what was taking place in his environment, so much that when he heard a soft "boo" in his ear, he jumped away from the source, rapidly twisting around to see it was Kasumi. She was standing there with an evil smile and a glass of water, holding it in her right hand while her left hand was behind her; she was tilting the glass of water right and left.<p>"I think it is quite commendable that you concentrate so hard when you want to Ranma. By the way, I think you need this?" She smiled gently.<p>Kasumi held the glass out towards Ranma.<p>"A glass of water?"<p>"Warm water"<p>"Oh.. thanks Kasumi."<p>Ranma really wanted to make a comment about how Akane only ever splashes him with cold water and why she couldn't just do what Kasumi did. He thought it wasn't the place or time to say that. He just thanked Kasumi had remembered that he was in girl form and was kind enough to bring warm water down.<p>Ranma felt that he didn't need the water anymore. He felt so warm inside that he felt his curse should automatically de-activate. Well, he could only wish.<br/>Ranma gratefully accepted the glass of warm water and upsized it over his head, handing it back to her when he was done, deciding that a little conversation wouldn't be bad.<p>"Oh by the way Kasumi, I figured out how Koryu uses ki."<p>Kasumi lifted her eyebrows and smiled.<p>"Oh did you? That's wonderful Ranma... how does he do it?"<p>"It's like this. He is like... a very careful ki user. He can channel small amounts of ki in like... exactly where he wants it."<p>"Precise, Ranma, Koryu uses ki very precisely." Kasumi corrected. Ranma had missed his tutoring lesson last night, but that was alright. She would forgive him this one time.<p>Ranma then proceeded to explain the whole senario regarding the hole in the ground with the sweep kick, when he fought Kuno and when he was training yesterday. He chose to demonstrate it to Kasumi, hoping to give her a better understanding. Ranma went out to the back yard and stood in his stance, waiting for Kasumi to follow him. He started the demo as he sensed her to his right.<p>"Now look carefully." he commanded.<p>Ranma exhaled slowly, bent his knees slightly, leaned forward a little   and almost dissapeared from sight after literally blowing up the ground he was   standing on backwards . There was a sliding noise on the opposite side of the   yard where Kasumi kocked her head to the right to see Ranma upside down, on his head,<br/>with his hands and feet dangling. Things didn't seem to have gone right.<p>"See? I used the ki in my whole body and pushed it hard," Ranma said, a little  strained in his current posture, "Now I can't control it so well but hey, at least im   getting somewhere. Didja see how fast I was?"<p>Kasumi nodded, slightly startled. She knew Ranma was fast, but he had never  really dissapeared from sight before. She saw dust arising from where Ranma originally   stood, and walked up to it. Upon inspecting it she saw that there were a two holes   there, slightly shaped like feet. She raised her eyebrows at Ranma, who had gotten  up and was walking towards her.<p>"See? What I think is, Koryu somehow channel's his ki into the ground and somehow protects it from being damaged. Its like he uses the ki to make the ground stronger, then he uses his ki in his feet to push against his own ki...kinda.. ya get it?" he said as he got close to her.<p>"Oh my, that sounds like its quite difficult... I mean, how would you be able to have your own ki in two places?"<p>"Exactly! That's the whole deal! Damn Kasumi, you're really smart!" Ranma  smiled. She may not be much of a martial artist, but she always seemed to easily  understand what Ranma wanted to say, he thought.<p>That was exactly it; he needed to be able to have his ki infused in his  leg, or any other part of his body, and at the same time, let a little off to  make the surface of whatever he was touching stronger. He would be using a   re-inforcement kind of ki.<p>This made Ranma realize that Koryu was even better than Herb at ki manipulation.<p>"Ranma, I thought we had an agreement that you would try to improve, your language." Kasumi teased, even if it did sound as if she had just scolded Ranma.<p>"I uh... sorry Kasumi. I guess I forgot." Ranma scratched the back of his head sheepisly.<p>"And tonight, I will make sure you study very hard."<p>Ranma face faulted.<p>"You aren't like gonna... er ... going to be a mean boring   teacher are ya- you?" he asked<p>"Oh my, Ranma, do you think I would?" Kasumi winked, smiling wickedly.<p>Ranma gulped as he walked back into the dojo. Apparently Kasumi wasn't  too affected by this morning. That was for all the better, he thought. He needed  balance right now, not more problems.<br/>Once inside he calmed his nerves and did his warm up kata one more time at a very fast speed, flowing through his movements like a roller coaster.<p>Kasumi went to the far side of the dojo and sat down, thinking as   she watched in fascination while Ranma did his kata astoundingly fast; even Kasumi   knew this was no small feat.<p>A thought hassled her mind as she tried to pay attention to the young  martial artist. She fought with it for a while, trying to figure out a reasonable  resolution to the problem that would arise. She figured out a simple conclusion and decided to voice her opinion to her companion.<p>"Ranma." she said.<p>"Yeah?" Ranma grunted, not missing a step in his kata.<p>"It's 'Yes' Ranma." Kasumi chided.<p>"Huh?... oh yea... I mean...Yes?" he said haltingly, it took a moment for Ranma to get his bearings while performing his katas.<p>"Do you know Akane is jealous of you?"<p>Ranma stopped his kata prematurely to give Kasumi a look of bewilderment.<p>"Jealous? Why?"<p>"Don't you think she's jealous because you are good at the art and she is not?"<p>"That's not my fault! She doesn't train properly."<p>"Don't you think its also because every time she gets into a fight, you bail her out? She never gets to fight properly."<p>"Er... She could get hurt!"<p>"Don't you get hurt in your fights?" Kasumi countered.<p>"Its different, she could get really hurt in her fights. And I don't fight her seriously because I don't want to hurt her."<p>"Then how is she supposed to get stronger?"<p>Ranma seemed stumped at that. Well, Kasumi did have a point.<p>"So what do I do? I gotta .. I have got to fight her?" Ranma said.<p>"Well, that would be a start. You need to hit her every once in a while and hurt her. That way she will get better, and she might even start treating you better. You never know."<p>"Hmm" Ranma thought. That whole weak girls thing and not hitting girls thing  was taught by his father. Maybe that was not right.<p>"Hey, what about the thing that guys don't hit girls thing?" Ranma asked, he didn't  know what to make of this. He figured Kasumi might help him out. Hey, didn't he have  something else to ask her? Oh Yea! Koryu and spirits. Before Kasumi  had answered, Ranma broke in with "Hey, also, what about that spirit thing with Koryu?"<p>Kasumi looked at Ranma with dismay. "I know its hard, but atleast can you continue to try and speak properly?"<p>"Ah.. sorry... I did it again huh?" Ranma smiled meekly, scratching the back of his head.<p>"Its alright. Now to answer your first question, Ranma it depends on you.<br/>In society, it is not considered good for a man to hit a girl. There are however,<br/>several exceptions. Like this, for example. Akane is a martial artist. So are  Ukyo and Shampoo. You are in fact insulting them when you say that you wont fight  them because they are girls. How would you like if someone declined you something  giving the reason that you were a guy? I am sure you wouldn't like that. Secondly,<br/>to answer your other question, its better if you ask Koryu because he didn't tell  me anything more than you know." Kasumi explained.<p>Ranma seemed a bit downcast at the reply to the second question, but he immiately thought about the reply to the first question after seeing the look on Kasumi's face.<p>"Also, Ranma. Just to make it easier for you to understand, do you think it is honorable to differentiate because of who or what a person is?"<p>"Hmm... I guess it isn't. Maybe I listened to po- father too much. I never  really questioned what he told me. He never wanted me to question his methods  anyways. It was always 'for the art' with him. He always thought he knew everything."<p>"Ranma, there are many things your father said that are worth questioning." Kasumi said dryly, arching her eyebrows.<p>"Heh.. yea... I mean yes. Aw come on Kasumi, its hard."<p>"Of course it is hard, you've been talking like this your whole life.<br/>Look. Think of this as a challenge. Just like you are trying to learn Koryu's  style, try and learn how to talk better. Try and learn how to study better. Take  the same approach to many things like you do with martial arts. Practice alone and with others. You should also not neglect your studies Ranma because whether you like it or not, just good at martial arts will not get you much in life now days. Do you understand?" Kasumi argued, deciding to change her approach to help him understand.<p>Ranma needed to change much in his attitude, and it would not be easy, nor would it be quick. Not at all.<p>Ranma turned around and started his kata, again at fast speeds. Kasumi supposed he was thinking, and let him have his peace. During the next five minutes, only sounds of movement and heavy breathing were heard. After he stopped, he turned to look at Kasumi with a small smile.<p>"Sorry, You're right. I need to change my attitude towards different things. I need to change my attitude towards Akane, studies, everything."<p>"It's alright Ranma. Just as long as you know you have to do this and try, I will be happy." Kasumi said with a cheery smile and then she gave him a warning look. "Just don't be disheartened when you don't succeed so easily. Keep on trying, like you do with martial arts. I am sure you have studied balance in the art. The principle of balance is also applied in life. All your life you have done nothing but the art. I am not suggesting that you reduce your training, just asking you to efficiently use your free time to help you train yourself in what you are lacking as a person, like your speaking habits, or your studies."<p>Ranma was a little taken back, at the manner Kasumi explained her viewpoint. She had used what he had known as a martial art's idea to applied it to his life. It made him think different. He had little else apart from martial arts in his life. If that were not enough, what would he do? Kasumi was not at all stopping him from reducing his training.<p>Kasumi was only encouraging him to gain what he lacked whenever he could. This really did seem like a win-win situation for him. Since he had never really been in such a corner before, he could not understand the feeling. Electing that this was something good, Ranma closed his eyes and thought for a moment before replying immediately.<p>"Yes, I will," Ranma said slowly, smiling, "Ok, now I got to get back to mastering Koryu's style. I didn't seem to damage the floors yesterday because I wasn't fighting with that much intensity. Lets see how I go today." He took a deep breath and started moving through all stances, starting to infuse ki along the way throughout his whole body.<p>It was difficult.<p>Ranma had never been in a situation where he needed only a small controlled amount of ki, so initially, this was very difficult.<p>Kasumi watched him continue his training for ten more minutes, when she decided it was time to prepare breakfast. She smiled at Ranma sweetly and walked off to the kitchen.<p>Ranma continued his kata , not missing even a second of training. He was getting better, but it would still take time. The possibilities were limitless when he did finally master this style. He would change the way he threw ki blasts, he could change the way he uses the Hi Ryu Sho Ten Ha!<p>With renewed energy, Ranma cautiously and at great speed, continued his training.<p>In the kitchen, Kasumi started wondering how to solve the problem Sasuke's knowledge was posing while she went about preparing breakfast.<p>They could just have Ranma or her talk to him. He was such a nice person so she was sure he would't mind keeping such type of problems from taking place.<p>Yesterday, Kuno had mentioned the sword that Koryu had. That meant that he must have seen the sword when Kasumi carried it.<p>Kasumi sighed, wondering what she was going to do when she heard a rap on the kitchen window.<p>"hmm?" Kasumi wondered who it could be at this time. Maybe it was a stray cat. Oh no, that wouldn't be good for Ranma. Kasumi opened the kitchen window to see if what it was when she heard a voice.<p>"Don't be alarmed, it's me, Koryu."<p>"Oh my!" Kasumi exclaimed, going back from the window quickly.<p>A head popped down from the top of the windowsill. It was Koryu's head. After the initial shock, Kasumi's face slowly started to show a smile, then she giggled. Koryu was looking kind of cute, having his head bopping up side down, Kasumi thought.<p>"Um, what's funny? I noticed you're smiling. I hope I didn't surprise you much." said the upside down man, holding on to the roof ledge with only his hands.<p>"You look just like a kid, soo cute" said Kasumi, still smiling holding her hands in front of her mouth now.<p>"Kid huh? Yeah, sure why not. I've been called many things in my life. I guess being called a kid is actually a complement when I compare it to those." Koryu said as he climbed into the kitchen.<p>"What names would those be?" Kasumi asked innocently, heading towards the stove. She was surprised, but it was alright. It was Koryu. Part of her was happy that he seemed to be feeling better, what with his wounds.<p>"UH... lets just say you don't want to know." Koryu said as he froze, a sweat drop making its way down the back of his head, .<p>"And why not?" Kasumi said inquisitively, turning to look at him, holding a giant knife in her hands.<p>"Three words. 'They're not nice'."<p>"Oh, come on Koryu, they can't be that bad?" Kasumi giggled, turning around to start chopping some carrots.<p>"Oh yes they can." Koryu nodded in a knowing manner. He didn't want to tell her this. It would probably scare her. When he saw her look change to the one he saw when he nearly had his ear pulled out, the day the went out, he sighed in defeat. He wasn't too keen on knowing where she could put that knife.<p>"Ok ,look you're going to feel scared of me...just let me tell you that I haven't really done anything to warrant these names as such... well mostly." Koryu glanced at Kasumi who has giving him a confused look while she continued chopping. He didn't try to change the subject by asking her how she could not chop her fingers off while she wasn't looking, he had a sneeky feeling it wouldn't work. Koryu sighed in defeat, choosing, very reluctantly to answer her question.<p>"Well, names such as 'Demon Killer', 'Demon', 'Walking Death', these are the usual, oh and this is probably the best, given to me by my worst of enemies, 'The Ultimate Killing Machine'." Koryu rattled off. He looked at Kasumi, she turned to look at him for a moment with a blank face and then burst out laughing uncontrollably. Koryu looked at her with a sad smile.<p>"You have no idea how glad I am knowing you find this funny, but Kasumi-chan, I regretfully have to tell you that I wasn't joking." Koryu said looking towards the refrigirator seriously, and so sadly that Kasumi immediately stopped her laugh, coughing a bit trying to control it.<p>She looked at Koryu, his face was now blank. It showed absolutely no form of emotion at all. It almost... no it looked like a dead face, only that the eyes were open. She was instantly reminded of Ranma three days ago. He looked exactly like that. That face showed nothing, but those eyes, showed so much pain.<p>"Ko-Koyru..." Kasumi managed.<p>Koryu turned to look at her, his face morphed slightly as his lips twisted up at the edges to resemble a smile, but it looked nothing like the smile that he showed two days ago.<p>"I-I thought you didn't kill-" Kasumi began, quivering slightly.<p>"I didn't, I've taken care of a few demons but I've never killed anyone. If you're wondering why I'm given those names, its because everyone knows that I am fully capable of doing whatever is deserving of those names. I am a fully trained killer. I can easily turn around and kill anyone I want. Anyone. I have to give them this impression and prove that I have the power, should I wish use it, to keep them away, feeding on their fear. With the people I deal with in my line of work, that is the only way things will work." Koryu explained.<p>"I-I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have laughed..."<p>"Naa. Its ok, I would rather you laught it off as a joke, but then you would ask me to give you the real names, and I would have to tell you... so no harm done. I've gotten used to it. Please don't be scared of me Kasumi-chan. I have been honest with you since we met. Well, I mean, what do you expect? I am a covert operative. That's gotta stand for something, don't ya think?"<p>Kasumi stood there in silence, concentrating on the preparation of the breakfast. Koryu stood there looking at her, his face had returned to the normal happy-go-lucky that she had seen earlier.<p>"Sorry, but I told you that you wouldn't want to know. I'll guess I'll go now. Sorry, I just wanted to say hi" Koryu moved to leave.<p>"No Koryu-chan!" Kasumi turned around.<p>"Hmm?"<p>"No... It's alright. Sorry, I just found it a bit, surprising."<p>Koryu shrugged.<p>"And I'm not surprised that you did. I would be surprised if you didn't find it surprising though." he smiled a little. After a few moments that smile turned a little larger. Soon he was grinning like what Kasumi thought he was at times; an idiot.<p>"Baka!" Kasumi threw a little water at him, which he dodged carefully. He was wearing a simple blue T-shirt and black jeans with some black boots, which he apparently didn't want wet. The water splashed on the floor.<p>"Thank you Kasumi-chan." he said with a smile.<p>"Hmm? No its alright. I understand. I just forgot that you seem to have undergone a lot of stress as well. Anyways, its good that you came. I have a question to ask you." Kasumi said, her answer to the Sasuke problem in sight.<p>"Sure, what is it. I just hope I don't cause you more problems."<p>"No silly, you know that Sasuke problem we had?"<p>"Yea..." Koryu began, his mind already onto what Kasumi was thinking.<p>"Well he told his... master about you and the sword. The master is a   little loony, no doubt, but people will find or have found out. They won't believe   much, but if you don't exist, then questions might arise." Kasumi said slowly, while preparing some tea.<p>"Ok...and how do I fit in? Lemme guess, I gotta make an appearance."<p>"Yes, please." Kasumi pleaded.<p>"Look, you know my story, I gotta lay low. I can't afford to go around."<br/>Koryu began but one look at Kasumi's face made him give in.<p>"Oh alright. Fine. Besides, this is my fault... this Sasuke wouldn't  have found nothing interesting if I didn't come. I guess I'll play around. So what,<br/>I'm your old friend. I gotta make up a person and be him now? " Koryu shrugged, "That should be alright. I'll just say I work for the Japanese government and I am not permitted to say what I do. Whatever, that way no one can look me up. If they try, well lets just say I have quite a bit of experience as a spy." he completed with a grin.<p>"Thank you, Koryu-chan." Kasumi replied gratefully.<p>"Don't thank me, you just remind me of my younger sister." Koryu blurted out  without thinking. He immediately regretted this. He turned towards Kasumi, giving a   solemn look.<p>"Sister? I thought I reminded you of your 'mother'." Kasumi gave a startled look.<p>Silence.<p>Kasumi watched Koryu's expressions intensely for a few seconds to try and  understand. Unfortunately, there was absolutely no change in his facial expression  at all when he made his reply.<br/>"When you're scary, you remind me of my mom. But your looks and general behaviour reminds me of my sister." Koryu muttered slowly, letting that piece of information seep into Kasumi.<p>"Oh my, well, at least now I know why you want me to call   you 'oni-chan'" Kasumi smiled, after a moments thought. She was beginning to know  a bit more of Koryu. Her picture of him really did look like abstract art, but it was coming along nicely.<p>"Look, I'm sorry, really. I just wan't to ask why you trust me, I mean you were open with me that day. Ranma, I can understand, but you... I don't. You have no real reason to trust me."<p>"Ranma trusts you, So will I." Kasumi said sweetly, finishing that line of conversation with the quick shaking of her hand.<p>"Bleh...look... you can't fool me Kasumi. You were desperate. You   needed someone to trust, especially when you figured Ranma could be in trouble and  you decided to trust me because I had behaved in a nice manner." Koryu said sternly,   ignoring Kasumi's look of sudden shock, "I know how the mind works Kasumi,   you shouldn't be soo trusting in people. There are people who will do   something similar to me to get into an advantageous position. I just was hoping  you would admit that to me. Sorry for saying it like this, but I just wanted   you to know this. I understand how you feel. Being alone in the midst of people  is one of the things that can be worse than being all alone by your self. I am  glad you decided to trust me, because I would never do anything to harm you. There  are people who would though, just so you know.<p>Kasumi stared down at the ground in shame as Koryu analysed her accurately. There was a moment of silence, before Koryu spoke again, very softly.<p>"Having said that, I am glad of what you did," he started. Kasumi raised her head towards him, her heart pounding. "I think that was a good day for you and Ranma. You needed to flush those pent up feelings out of your system. I am just happy I was able to help. You got lucky with me Kasumi, just be a little more careful to trust the next guy who suddenly pops up. " Koryu smiled.<p>There was silence for a moment again before Kasumi broke it.<p>"I guess I was in a bit of a desperate state of affairs, and wanted  to trust you, but I was so scared that something wrong would happen and Ranma  would lose whatever sense he had. Before you arrived, he wall all broken. I   was scared something bad was going to happen. Also, you helped him in the morning,<br/>and I don't really think there has ever been anyone who helped him without  wanting anything back in return. I figured you could help me out. It also didn't  help that you were flirting with me." Kasumi ended in a slightly accusatory tone.<br/>"Hey, chill, I sensed your urgent behavior...I only wanted to get you a bit more relaxed." Koryu shrugged slightly. " Anyways, I guess you have a good point. Ohh well, I didn't want to go off on this tangent, but I atleast wanted you to understand, for your sake, that I could just as well be someone using you."<br/>"You are not." said Kasumi firmly, turning around to breakfast again.<br/>Koryu narrowed his eyes, wondering why she was so confident in her belief. 'Oh well, everyone's got their own secrets and abilities.' he thought to himself.<p>"Ok.. so we met, where, in a mall? Umm what? I obviously didn't go to your school Kasumi, its too easy to trace." Koryu said off hand.<p>"Actually, we can say that, going to the mall is fine. If it is possible, could you please drop by sometime today, I would be greatful. Maybe you could meet my father." Kasumi asked, setting the now ready breakfast in a tray.<p>"I guess that's fine... It will reduce the kind of suspicions I guess. Hey, that'll give me an excuse to fight Ranma. Not a bad idea! I know I'm supposed to lay low but this won't be bad at all." said Koryu a little enthusiatically.<p>Kasumi smiled at Koryu. She knew that Ranma couldn't wait to fight Koryu again, he's been giving it his best to become better. She chose to voice her opinion. Koryu looked at her with raised eye brows and started chuckling.<p>"You think that Ranma can't beat you?" Kasumi asked, wondering what Koryu would find funny in learning that Ranma wanted to fight him again, badly.<p>"Kasumi, he already IS better than me." Koryu said.<p>There was a moment's silence.<p>"Ok, now you've lost me." Kasumi said, folding her arms.<p>"I'll make this real simple. I am a ninja, I command a covert ops unit,<br/>deception is one of the things I'm good at. I am just making Ranma think he's way  weaker than I am. He is actually already better than I am in hand to hand combat.I'm just deadlier. That gives me the edge but not for long. Just remember one thing about me Kasumi, no matter what. I'm only human. I usually scare an enemy and use that fear as an advantage." Koryu explained.<p>"Ranma's not one to scare easily." Kasumi commented, a smile coming onto her face, albeit slowly, as she turned around in her place.<p>"I realized. He's already got a great start on mastering my fighting style."<p>"...you know?" Kausmi raised her eyebrows.<p>"Of course! Been watchin' him. He's cool, when he analyzed my technique and   started working on it, I actually shivered. Heck, even I can't wait for the rematch.   Its not often I get to fight a natural born warrior just for fun, you know what I mean?   Its always this person or that person trying to kill me or some bullshit like that."   vented Koryu. The last sentence had been said with some resentment.<p>"Koryu! Please tone down your language. You are just as bad as Ranma   at times." scolded Kasumi. She un-folded her arms and gave Koryu a stare, before turning  to the breafast again. Inwardly she was happy of what Koryu admitted, but she didn't   appreciate such language in front of her, even if she let it slide usually.<p>"Ah... sorry, anyways, look Ranma is several years younger than me, you have  to keep that in mind. He's already better than me in hand-to-hand combat and he  can generate a hell of a lot more ki than I can. I just have trained to be more  precise with my ki and can focus it better, and I use a sword. That's all really.   We are just...well you can consider us almost opposites." Koryu smiled<p>Kasumi was about to question his remark when she heard people walking down  stairs. "Ah Koryu, you have to-"<p>Koryu was already gone, as if he dissapeared into thin air.<p>'Hmmm... Opposites? Well, Ranma should be very happy now.' Kasumi thought to herself.<p>She took the tray and went off to the living room to set down the food. When she entered, she saw that Akane was sitting with a frown on her face.<p>"Good morning Akane. What's wrong? You seem upset." Kasumi said kindly.<br/>"My alarm clock didn't wake me up this morning. The batteries ran out. I was looking forward to start training harder." Akane muttered, just as Nabiki slouched into the room.<p>"Good morning Nabiki, how are you?" Kasumi beamed, laying out breakfast for her family.<p>"Mornin'" Nabiki managed, somehow.<p>Soun Tendo arrived soon after and breakfast was served. Akane looked around for Ranma, and apparently didn't see him so she voiced her question.<p>"Anyone seen the baka? I went to wake him up but he wasn't in bed."<p>"That's because unlike someone, he woke up early to train!" said Ranma,<br/>walking into the room. He was annoyed, quite annoyed at the fact that he didn't   do anything to Akane and she had to start the morning off with calling him names.<p>"The alarm clock batteries ran out last night! It's not my fault!" Akane said heatedly.<p>"It never is..." Ranma walked in and sat down next to Nabiki. After hearing  Akane's remark, he didn't feel like sitting next to her.<p>"What was that!" Akane got up angry.<p>"Akane, Ranma, please do not fight." Kasumi commanded, in her loving sort of way.<p>Akane, looked at Kasumi, a little miffed and was about to refute when her father spoke up, walking into the room with the morning newspaper.<p>"Oh relax Kasumi, it's only their love quarrel." he said, folding the newspaper,<br/>and keeping it aside so he could eat breakfast.<p>"Its NOT!" Ranma and Akane shouted in unison.<p>"Be it lover's quarrel or any kind of quarrel, it will not take place  on while we eat. Is that understood, both of you?" Kasumi looked at Ranma and Akane,<br/>making them both feel a little uncomfortable for a few seconds.<p>Ranma looked at her indifferently at first, glancing at her from the side. He  was still annoyed at Akane, but since he was used to this side of Kasumi and knew her feelings  he wasn't really surprised. He bowed deep towards her, apologizing.<p>"Sorry, Kasumi. I just didn't like being called a names for nothing." Ranma  said, raising his head a little to look at her.<p>"That's still no excuse Ranma. Please apologize to Akane for that tone of voice you used."<p>Ranma looked at Kasumi with wide eyes. She softened her look at him, begging  him to do as she says with her  took a deep breath, and slowly turned towards  Akane.<p>"Sorry." he said. 'Only for Kasumi, only for Kasumi.' the mantra continued in his  mind.<p>Akane humphed.<p>"Akane, now I would like you to apologize to Ranma for calling him a 'baka' for  no reason."<p>Akane's somewhat satisfied look turned into a scandalized one. "But he-"<p>Her reply was however, stopped short by Kasumi's loving smile. Akane wanted  to protest more, but decided not to disobey her elder sister.<p>Akane looked towards Ranma and said something under her breath.<p>"I'm sorry Akane, I didn't hear you." Kasumi asked almost innocently.<p>"I said im sorry, for calling you a baka." Akane said a little louder.<p>"Good, now we can continue with breakfast." Kasumi said sweetly, as if nothing  had ever happened.<p>In her mind, Akane was still quite upset. 'That Baka! Now because of him, even  Kasumi-nee is acting different.' she thought.<p>The breakfast was over surprisingly quickly after that event. Kasumi started to gather  the lying dishes as she looked at Ranma for a second. He was getting up.<p>"Ranma, can you please quickly help me clear the table? Koryu might be coming today,<br/>he did say that he would arrive in a few days in the morning, so it would be best if I clean  up the house." said Kasumi.<p>"Uh, oh yeah!...I mean... yes, sure" Ranma sweat dropped. He didn't notice any change  in Kasumi's demeanor, and told himself that he was safe, for the moment.<p>"Koryu? Oh your date for Sunday?" Akane asked.<p>"Hmm, I wouldn't mind meeting him. Is he cute?" Nibiki chirped, a devilish  smile gracing her elegant features, while getting up from the table.<p>Kasumi, with a few dishes in her tray, thought for a moment, blinking a few times.<br/>"I guess he is cute. Sweet guy. Met him in a mall a few years ago, he was really nice  and well behaved; a very polite young man." Kasumi said finally as her back disappeared  into the kitchen. Ranma gathered a few dishes that were remaining and expertly took them  back to the kitchen.<p>Akane laughed a bit, getting ready to head off to school as she picked  up her bag and waited for Nabiki. "What are you laughing about?" asked the Ice Queen  as she picked up her bag and reached Akane at the door.<p>"Nothing really," Akane said giggling a bit, "its just that if he's Kasumi's   friend, then its obvious he'll be very polite. I mean, I just can't imagine Kasumi  having any friends that are like the perverts at Furinkan. Though I didn't know sis  had a guy friend, and if he IS perverted...sometimes Kasumi-nee is too trusting.   Oh well, Ranma! We're going to be late again!" Akane shouted towards the kitchen.<p>"We can go without him Akane, don't worry, he'll catch up to us. Anyways, I   need to talk to you. Lets talk on the way to school shall we?" Nabiki said, dragging  Akane out the house while yelling back to Ranma. "Ranma! We're going ahead of you, be  a nice guy and bring out bentos for us please!"<p>Inside the kitchen, said boy was mumbling. "Geh, couldn't they wait for a bit?"<br/>Ranma went on putting the dishes in their place for Kasumi and helped her washing them.<br/>"Oh, its OK Ranma, I can do the washing." She said but Ranma shook his head."Nah,<br/>why shouldn't I help out, the water is warm and it really wont take me long to hop to school  by myself." he stated as he helped her quickly wash the dishes.<p>"Oh, by the way." Kasumi whispered in a conspirational tone.<p>Ranma perked his ears towards Kasumi.<p>"Koryu dropped when I was preparing breakfast. He told me that he will be coming  around to make an appearance as an old friend and say that he works for the government. He  won't tell anything else, so we don't know anything. Lets just say that 3 days ago he  was visiting. He's a martial artist. I mean...in regards to what happens here, no one can  doubt that. If anyone want's to know anything then either they'll ask me or Koryu." Kasumi  whispered.<br/>Ranma nodded in reply. "Thats a good idea, Sasuke only dropped in when Koryu was   put his sword in his sheath. At first I was not sure, but now I am, Sasuke doesn't know  anything about the whole portal deal. He knows about the spirit sword, because it was glowing  when Koryu held it. Kuno didn't mention anything about other worldly. He is always blabbering  about the demons though, so it should be alright."<p>"Thats good," Kasumi smiled as she picked up the next dish to dry.<p>"Anyways, so when he come's he will handle it? Well, he is into that sort of   spy stuff so I think it should be all right. Now I can't wait to fight him again!" The pig  tailed martial artist said excitedly, a little too excitedly for the fragile bowl  in his hand, breaking it when he flexed his muscles in elation.<br/>"Oops, sorry Kasumi." Ranma said meekly, looking quickly at his bleeding finger where  an edge had cut him. "Geh, just a scratch" he casually commented, deciding it was nothing to fret  about, and reached back to collect the broken pieces only go have his hand grabbed by  Kasumi. She studied the finger hastily, taking a quick glance at the dripping blood, and   promptly inserting the finger in her mouth. Ranma gazed at her with wide eyes for a moment,<br/>a hew of red developing on his face. "Ka-Kasumi, it really is a scratch, nothing to worry about.<br/>You know I've been through much worse."<p>Kasumi only tilted her head, giving her traditional smile in reply, as she continued  sucking, cleaning the cut so she could bandage it.<p>Five minutes later, Ranma was jumping from rooftop to rooftop, quickly making his  way to school. He wasn't really too worried about being late, for some reason. He had  the three bento's in one hand, cradled so they wouldn't fall. He looked at his cut finger,   currently bandaged; it felt warm, just like Kasumi had in the morning. '...?' That was   the last thought he had on his mind when he sensed someone approaching from above, someone   familiar.   He immediately leaped to the right, a moment later Shampoo landed in a spot slightly  adjacent to where he was. Ranma narrowed his eyes towards the Amazon girl. He would   rather be at school attending classes than deal with her.<p>"Shampoo," He said quietly, "What do you want?"<p>"Shampoo want to ask for air- Ranma to fight."<p>"A fight? Why? Look I don't have time, I gotta get to class." Ranma asked increadulously. He really did want to get to class.<p>Shampoo looked inquisitively at Ranma for a second before replying, "Ranma,<br/>great grand mother teach shampoo new techniques but she say that Shampoo need a strong partner who is of same or almost same size." Shampoo said dejectedly.<p>"What about Mousse, Kodachi, or Ukyo? Why me? You could even use Akane." Ranma stated cautiously. He had a sneaky feeling that there was more to this than meets the eye.<p>"Mousse too weak. Great grandmother say the best opponent must be strong. Ranma strongest. Others not strong enough. If Ranma help train, then even Ranma can learn new technique." Shampoo tried to convince, getting her foot around the peddle on her bike, "Take time to think if you want. If want to train, then airen.- ah Ranma come to the Nekohaten and talk, yes? Shampoo go now. Have nice day at school."<p>She left, jumping off the roof and landing on to the street below, taking off, most probably to make her delivery, Ranma thought. This was very strange. Shampoo was not pushing herself on him, asking for his help, and even asked him to think about it...something was really wrong.<br/>Things had started going his way lately, but even Ranma knew that all of a sudden things couldn't be getting better like that. He took a running jump from the building and landed on the next, continueing his way to school. He would think about it. A part of him wanted her behavior not to lead him into some sort of scheme. He didn't want open hostility with anyone he considers his friends...kind of. Happosai's words still rang through Ranma's thoughts as he made his way to school.<p>Half an hour later, Shampoo arrived at the nekohaten, running straight to Cologne to inform her of what had happened. After the explanation the Amazon Elder nodded in understanding.<p>"It is as I expected, son-in-law is suspicious. He doesn't want a trap. It is up to him if he wants to come or not. If he doesn't, then we will train with Mousse. Maybe that Ukyo girl would come, maybe even Akane. I suppose Akane would be a good choice. I would be fun to train her, what do you think?" Cologne locked her beady eyes on Shampoo, letting the food she was peparing cook away.<p>Shampoo dismissed that idea with the flick of her wrist.<p>"Violent kitchen destroyer not good enough to be Shampoo partner.." She deadpanned.<br/>"Hmm, maybe you are right. She would be a good partner for Mousse though. Lets just get you started with Mousse." Cologne smiled. Yes, things were going as planned.   Even Shampoo didn't know about this plan...If that girl truly thinks it is just a training, she will be less inclined to openly attempt anything underhanded while being slightly pre-occupied.   Son-in-law's desire to learn new techniques might just bring him to the Nekohaten. He might even want some council pertaining to the Saffron issue. The change of behavior, if Shampoo listened to what she was told, will definatily affect the young man. He will change, slowly but surely.<p>"Okay Shampoo, you can now collect Mousse from the store room. He is going to need a shower and some food, in the afternoon we will start the training on ki control." said Cologne, walking over to a dish that was nearly complete. "Then you can start attending the customers, some are arriving now."<p>"Yes, great grand mother." said Shampoo as she went to carry out her tasks for the rest of the day.<p>The walk home from school was long and slow for three Tendo house hold residents, each one having their own reasons. Ranma was walking on the fence as Akane and Nabiki were walking side by side, each in deep thought.<p>Akane grudged on slowly, both her hands holding her bag as it occasionally battered with the back of her leg, thinking about the talk she and Nabiki had in the morning, during the walk to school.   Akane took a glance at the middle tendo sister, walking contently, relaxed,   having a gleam in her eye that told Akane that either she had successfully collected   some payments or had some good prospects coming up in the near future.<p>Akane sighed, the morning walk to school clear in her mind; Nabiki had   told her not to get angry at Ranma anymore, mainly for reasons that he was beginning   to get really frustrated. Fine, she knew that he had been behaving a little better,   but he still was sometimes such a pervert! He accepted the kiss on the cheek   from Ukyo last week after what she did at the wedding. There was no reaction on his  face at all, he was not showing any emotion. He didn't do anything at all. He just  accepted it! He says he's not a pervert but still behaves the same. How can he still   be friends with them after what they have done? He was even talking to Ukyo today!<p>He had been quiet for a week, then he starts behaving towards the other   fiancees as if nothings really happened, and yesterday he had told her thathe cares  for her.   'ARGGH! I can't understand him!' Akane's mind screamed.<p>'Its like what has happened has no meaning to him, he just takes it  as it is, he doesn't even fight anymore.' Akane thought, angrily. Even if her  sister says that Ranma's attitude is changing and he's getting frustrated, then  why isn't he fighting back even more? That's what he always does, doesn't he? Why  was he acting so defeated now, apart from when he beats Kuno out? At least he wasn't around today so she vented some anger out on the perverts in school.<p>A victim of a myraid of emotions and thoughts, Akane contemplated Ranma's attitude all the way towards home with only one conclusion in mind; they needed to talk, somehow.<p>Ranma, on the other hand, had no conclusions to his problems what   so ever, in his mind. His day at school had been atrocious. He only wished he hadn't   wondered why he wasn't attracting water as much lately. Somehow, he had spent most   of the day at school as a girl. If that wasn't worse enough, then Kuno had to come   into the picture spouting poetry only to be punted out.<p>To top it all off, Ukyo told him that she knew what his pop was up to.   She said that he was training in an abandoned building quite some distance away.   Not that that bothered him, Ranma himself was training very hard on the new techniques   and he was positive he would take his old man out instantly.<p>What bothered him was that his idiotic pop was training with his mother. Why  she was there, Ranma had no idea. The old man probably lied to her as usual.   She was the only one, apart from Kasumi, that Ranma really didn't want to upset. He was   just getting sick of the rest. Kuno's attempts at his girl form today clearly told him   how much he didn't want to continue things as they had been lately. Shampoo's request and attitude wasn't totally lost on him either. He didn't know what to think, but was positive this was some sort of trap; it always was.<p>On the other hand, he would welcome a change from everyone leaving him alone  for the time being...well as alone as it could be possible. Kodachi still had to show  her face, and he was certain she was planning something...<p>Ranma shuddered, glancing momentarily at Nabiki who had a happy glean  in her eye. 'Koryu!' Ranma thought. A smile almost ran across his face as he made  the connection. If Koryu was who he said he was, there was no reason for doubt, Nabiki   was going to be way in over her head if she tries to mess with him. It would be interesting for once, to see her at a loss. He just hoped Koryu was up to it.<p>Nabiki Tendo, walked onwards with mini skips in her steps. She could not  wait to be home. She really hoped this Koryu person would not have left, if he came  today. It was like Kasumi to ask people to stay for lunch and such so it would be   quite reasonable for Koryu to be home...that is if he made a good impression on   father. From what Nabiki deduced, he had bought Ranma quite expensive clothes, and  she could earn quite a bit from him if he was an interesting person.<p>She wouldn't cause problems for her sister's friend, but it would be interesting just to see him. Besides, if he had enough money to just give away, she was sure he would manage some interesting amount for her, one way or another.<br/>As she rounded the corner, some ruffling noise reached her ears, being emitted, she figured, from her house. By the time the three reached home, all were surprised at what they saw, though Akane was the first to act.<p>Her hair started rising in response to the battle aura that she had begun to discharge.<br/>Nabiki was still looking onwards at the sight with a slight shock while Ranma, initially having concern playing on his face, seemed to relax a bit.<p>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY SISTER!" Akane bellowed running forward.<p>Ranma smirked. "Oops... Bad idea Akane. " he said casually to himself instigating Nabiki to whirl her head around and look at Ranma with uncertainty marring her features.<p>End Chapter 8
