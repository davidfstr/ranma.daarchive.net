</div><p><b>I AM ALIVE!</b></p><p><b>I doubt you want to really know what's really been going on with me, apart from getting married, changing jobs, then changing careers.. etc. so heh. Yah. That's what.</b></p><p><b>Updated with chapter. Completed it, in fact. I'm back on track people! </b></p><p><b>I hope you like this.</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>Search for 'UPDATED 25/07/07' for the new update.</u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 12: Illusions</b></u></p><p>Kasumi stood quietly, staring at the wall clock that hung in the living room. An ancient clock left by her mother, Kasumi wondered why it had been so important. Her mother had adored it. It even chimed.</p><p>She meticulously watched the second hand move, slightly entranced by the sound created by the mechanics of the device. It wasn't until the clock hit two of clock, and set off a loud chime startled Kasumi, that the elder Tendo daughter shook her head ever so slightly and focused her mind to the current task.</p><p>The food was ready, and Father had been told. She was going to return a couple of books she had borrowed from Dr. Tofu, and she would most possibly be asked out to lunch again. If not, she would do the asking.</p><p>It made Kasumi a little uncomfortable, being so forward and …pushy with the relationship, but it had to go somewhere. If the two were not compatible, they should know. The only way to really figure it out was to spend time at it.</p><p>In a momentary lack of concentration, the young girl unconsciously stretched out her shoulders, hoping to relieve the tension in them.</p><p>'Hmm', she murmured to herself, relishing the movement. She decided for the moment to try and not think about why she felt tense. It was too confusing.</p><p>She had wanted this in the first place. Though known to her was a very simple fact. The time spent with Ranma in the past week had definitely put things in perspective.</p><p>He could be such a child at times, unwilling to study. Balancing his pencil on the tip of his nose, while balancing the rest of his books and bad on his fingers and toes was a feat his martial arts balance definitely did cater for.</p><p>He whined at times, and still liked to play around even while he worked. Oh yes, he had an active mind. Such actions did show his childhood behavior, and it had finally started coming out again since he had returned from China.</p><p>Yet, Kasumi pondered while idly glancing over at the living room doorway, he could be so mature. Whenever they had discussed anything in particular that required more astute attention, he would always assume a staid countenance.</p><p>He did have a knack of falling asleep during math, and was gradually improving – if at a slower pace. He did surprisingly well in the Social Sciences - especially physics. His ability to understand chemistry and biology was not that far off either.</p><p>Kasumi assumed it because he could apply the knowledge in practical areas.</p><p>He did seem to be putting in quite an effort to fix his kanji and calligraphy. When she had requested for his reason for the sudden determination, Ranma simply shrugged it off as making the impression of his exams better.</p><p>Kasumi still wondered about that answer. His writing ability was appalling, though not quite as bad as his math. He also needed to learn proper language 'protocols' to be able to write, and speak better.</p><p>On the latter, he was making a visible effort, which the brown haired girl had noticed more than several times. She really did appreciate the fact that he did not wish to disappoint her in any way. Now, if only Ranma would stop loosing or destroying his writing utensils, she would breathe easier.</p><p>Never had she heard so many excuses in her life, and never had they been so … what was the term Ranma would use? Ah, lame. Such attitude did make her wonder how he managed to study at all. Kasumi really didn't want to doubt him, and part of her was so adamant that he would not lie to her, but some excuses were just way too farfetched.</p><p>A classmate Gosunkugi wanted to cast a spell on the pencil with his germs on it so it would burn him?</p><p>He used it to defend himself from Kuno's strikes?</p><p>Broke it while being ki drained from a teacher?</p><p>Nabiki had stolen it from to sell it off to someone?</p><p>Now really, the last one was too farfetched. Nabiki had better things to do than to steal pencils. How much would she get for it? No one would be deluded enough to …</p><p>Kasumi's train of thought stopped, quite abruptly, to reverse a bit until it came back to the word 'deluded'. Given certain circumstances, in which Ranma was female, and was close to member of a Kuno, Kasumi was relatively certain that Nabiki would have been able to strike a deal.</p><p>The eldest Tendo daughter exhaled a deep breath, idly tweaking the hems of her skirt. It was just as well that she did not state her reluctance to believe Ranma's explanations. A moderate display of censure easily had Ranma feeling bad about it.</p><p>Again…Here it was again. Kasumi reprimanded herself mentally. She had just decided a short while ago not to dwell much on the pig tailed youth. If they spent too much time together or got too involved, she knew where it would lead.</p><p>It would be the worst disaster the Tendo family would have to fend off yet. This was something neither herself, nor Ranma could afford. Ranma was just being himself, and not too perceptive about the future of their newfound relationship.</p><p>She was; thus the set boundaries. Of course, she would spend time with him, the more the better. They did enjoy each other's company after all, and that was what scared her.</p><p>Fine, he could be quite immature at times, and childish, and careless regarding sociable protocol. His good looks alone could make one ignore some of his less agreeable attributes.</p><p>The rest was easily stripped away with his insight, and ability to understand Kasumi every step of the way. It was strange how he was able to answer her most estranged of questions very quickly and to the point. He could be very gentle, and surprisingly quiet when he was thinking, or in a somber mood.</p><p>After the recent events, his outlook and behavior had obviously changed. It would be obvious, she thought. What Ranma had kept on going as the norm was as long as everyone got out of things relatively unhurt.</p><p>The weight of death was heavy on sensitive hearts – or so it was said in some of the psychological material she had read. Ranma's was especially sensitive, for even though now he knew Saffron is not truly dead, he is still felt the same. No. This really would not do. It would be very improper for such things to go on as they were between her and the youth.</p><p>As much as she cared for him, and her feelings grew with the time they spent together – and she assumed was similar for the opposite – she knew the possible results of this endeavor.</p><p>Up till now Kasumi had lived for her family, and she shall continue doing so. She loved her family.</p><p>Content with her more <i>emotional </i>conclusion, the Tendo offspring checked the clock to see the time. Two – Fifteen. Completely unaware that she had been standing in the same spot for the last quarter of an hour, Kasumi turned around to head towards the exit of the house.</p><p>She found her 'required' books on the couch, and gently picked them up on her way out. It was a sad excuse really, she thought as she opened her door, and informed her father of her plans, making sure he knew that lunch and dinner was already prepared. Using books to see someone sounded something like what a schoolgirl would do.</p><p>Well, Kasumi hadn't gone to college, so she assumed she could still be classed in such a category. After letting off another long breath, she moved gracefully towards the exit of her compound.</p><p>The old compound gate creaked in greeting as she opened it, and croaked when she closed it, as it has been doing so for as long as she could remember. Her expectations high, and her decision resolute, Kasumi Tendo walked towards the Clinic.</p><p>Back in the Tendo home, Soun Tendo stood quietly staring into the Koi pond. Now those who knew him would understand that was not too bright. But at least he had something to do with his best friend Genma was around. They would have been on their third game of Shogi by now if he was here.</p><p>Now there wasn't so much to do anymore. He was briefly reminded of the time before Ranma and Genma had arrived; the good relaxation, hope, and also bad memories, and despair.</p><p>The Tendo patriarch did not have much time to himself as he felt a strong breeze followed by light touch on his head. When he looked at his shadow his head had turned into a large round ball.</p><p>His eyes widened, his jaw dropped – as did he – when he tried to mumble something, unable to do so.</p><p>"M-M-m-mas-master…What are you doing here?"</p><p>"What do you think my worthless student? I'm hungry! I've been diligently guarding my princesses all morning. I'm in need for some food. Now where's Kasumi? She always did satisfy my appetite with her cooking." Happosai looked about the compound. Usually the girl would be doing laundry at this time, if not making lunch or dinner.</p><p>"She's gone out. She – um – had to return some books. The food is prepared, however master. Would you like some?"</p><p>"Is that so? Is it? "The diminutive troll replied. "Well then, I'll let you serve your master. Then as a reward I'll take you on training."</p><p>A troll he may be, but he was also the Grand Master for the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. Soun Tendo did not dare anger him. The town council meeting was still fresh in his mind, but taking on the master without the help of Ranma and Genma was completely out of the question.</p><p>The fact that even with extra help, temporarily distracting the master from his current panty rampage seemed quite difficult. … The rusty old gears in the Tendo's mind stopped working for a moment, and reversed for a bit.</p><p>"Training?" There was no second guessing as to what genre of training the master had planned.</p><p>Let it be known that the only time Soun Tendo's mind actually starts working a little faster is when either of his children are involved, or when his master involved.</p><p>"Uh, Master? You may be a little tired from your hard days' of work. We haven't seen you in while. Come in. You should eat and have some rest." The mustached man blithered in a submissive tone.</p><p>The old toad thought for a moment, "Hmm, that may not be a bad idea, actually" He rotated his shoulders, as if to test them out. "Maybe a little massage would be in order before I take you and Genma out on that new training. Hey!"</p><p>As if just noticing, Happosai bounced off Soun's head and into the living room. "Come to think of it, where is that fool?"</p><p>"Uh, he's gone with his wife." Soun blurted, not wanting to disclose the location of his old friend or the reasons behind his departure.</p><p>"Heh, I go for a few days and he gets to do that huh? Well it's his loss" he muttered. "I'll just not take him on my new training. You! Soun, you will learn what I have to teach. It shall be a very new chapter in Anything Goes!"</p><p>"Yes master, I'm sure. Now would you like that food?" Soun asked meekly, hoping to divert the master until he could think of something more profound.</p><p>Happosai looked thoughtful for a moment, which would usually be reason enough to be either run away or be on guard – especially if you were female.</p><p>"Yes Tendo, I think it is time for some food. Even though I just ate a short while ago, all that running – ah – guarding, has my appetite going again." The small old man stated demurely. "Maybe a little food is in order."</p><p>"Y-you just ate? Where?"</p><p>"Huh? A deli on the far side of town."</p><p>"Did you pay?" Soun asked meekly, and received a kick in the head.</p><p>"Why should I pay when my students are here? Besides, I left them a bill to the Dojo, on the name Ranma Saotome."</p><p>"Ranma? Again?"</p><p>"Why not? He is my heir, isn't he?" Happosai nodded to himself, folding his arms. "He should serve his master, like you should. Now where is that food?"</p><p>"Ah- yes master!"</p><p>Thus, Soun went to the kitchen, praying for the first time in his life that Akane was there to mess up the food. At least then the old master would be knocked out long enough to be taken care of for the time being.</p><p>Ranma never had any money, so it was either Soun who had to pay or seek help from Nabiki. The smart girl always did manage to help him out, having Ranma pay her back in different means.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Quite a distance away from the Tendo compound, a different sort of despair rose to peaks. A young warrior, trained heavily in the art of stealth and deadly combat found himself in a desperate situation with a martial artist. There was just one problem.; he thought he was a cat.</p><p>"Damn!" Koryu muttered under his breath, grinding his teeth as he latched onto the wall of the building with naught but his fingers digging into the concrete. He quickly aligned his legs in a tangent to the wall allowing him to jump off in any instant.</p><p>At approximately twenty feet off the ground, his elevation provided no solace. His opponent could easily jump the distance, and had demonstrated so already. No matter what the Ninja did, he could not cloak himself from the human cat.</p><p>After the initial fight had broken out, Koryu had planned on trying to disable Neko-Ranma. But that soon turned out as a bad idea when he realized the effects of the swirling ki around him.</p><p>The intense blue aura kept on becoming stronger. Somehow the cat side had learned or accessed the ability Ranma had shown a short while ago while escorting Kasumi home. All initial attacks had been either dodged, or had no effect at all, because they were 'pushed' away from this eternal pressure of ki.</p><p>While Koryu did not want to resort to weapons, he had little choice in the matter. In his current state, Ranma was dangerous. Currently, the Ninja was the only one who could stop him.</p><p>"Here kitty, I know we got off to a good start now." Koryu murmured to himself, "Just because that retarded xeno-prick messed things up doesn't mean we can't get along again, does it?" He stared at his current adversary who was just below him, climbing up the wall leisurely and making low hissing noises.</p><p>Great! This was just what he needed. A human who thought he was a cat, and acted like he was spider.</p><p>Wanting to be proactive instead of reactive, Koryu hammered his heels into the wall as he disengaged his fingers, and almost disappeared from sight. His body, again providing the light show, flickered out and re-appeared a good distance away on another wall.</p><p>'Well', the dark haired man thought, 'at least I can lead him over to a good place of water. The canal going through this ward was not that far off.'</p><p>He had taken a second too long, however as he felt the erupting ki furnace launch toward him at high speed. With no other plausible action, Koryu focused every bit of his energy towards his arms and glared at his opponent.</p><p>He gathered the trajectory, and assumed his opponent's next form of attack instantly. The cat just didn't give him time to summon any techniques.</p><p>Neko-Ranma had leaped down from the previous building and bounded off the ground, destroying the pavement behind him in a strenuous leap towards his prey.</p><p>Koryu waited in his position for half a second more, and leaped off to meet Neko-Ranma head on, parrying the human cat's 'paw' with his forearm aiming to slam knee in the stomach. The plan worked, but the resolving ki around Ranma diluted the attack's force and shrugged it aside, leaving Koryu completely open for the first time.</p><p>He managed to block the oncoming paw, and refrain from receiving anymore cuts, but the force of the left handed downward slash he received sent him spiraling downwards where he became one with the road.</p><p>Moments later, Neko-Ranma landed beside him, hissing. He moved closer to inspect when Koryu lashed out, making the human cat jump back to evade, only to watch the ninja back flip in retreat.</p><p>Koryu concentrated hard, and tried not to focus much on his heavily bruised shoulder that had taken the brunt of the road as he back flipped in rapid form to a safe distance. 'I just got slapped by a <i>cat</i>,' He thought in consternation. 'Just how pathetic is that?'</p><p>After reaching approximately twenty feet away, he crouched in a low stance, fully aware that the distance was not a consolation. He realized Ranma could reach within his guard almost instantaneously, from the human cat's attacks.</p><p>Being a character who disliked being caught unawares, Koryu felt his body shudder in an involuntary wake of discontentment. He had been caught off guard one too many times in the past few weeks.</p><p>Taking down Ranma was proving itself to be a difficult task, and the situation worsened every moment that passed. Though he severely ostracized the idea, it would be much more prudent to go at full force instantly, instead of giving his opponent more glimpses of his abilities.</p><p>Koryu closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath and slowly tensed - relaxed muscles through his body individually. While such meditation may have taken many martial arts masters several seconds to prepare, it only took a moment for the ninja to converge his focus.</p><p>'Go.' It wasn't a command. It wasn't a request. It was just a statement; a confirmation giving his body and spirit the long awaited acceptance to let loose.</p><p>The air surrounding Koryu exploded among itself, distorting his image as is one was seeing him through an inverted lens, and Koryu dashed forward towards his opponent at speeds almost matching the Neko-ken user and reached the human feline within a second, whilst accurately ejecting a knife hand.</p><p>Neko-Ranma, who was been staring at his opponent and preparing for another attack, dodged to the side, barely missing a tag to the neck and responding with the same slash that had sent the disruptor down before,.</p><p>Koryu twisted slightly to the right and blocked using his attacking hand, using the momentary laps of balance (and surprise) of his opponent to grip his slashing wrist and then twisting it out of the way.</p><p>'No more free charge' Koryu grumbled as he demonstrated a mid stance semi-horizontal upper cut to the solar-plexus. A pity he would not be able to remember and learn from this move. As expected, his punch broke right through depression of ki surrounding Ranma tagging the Neko - induced martial artist hard.</p><p>The result sent Neko-Ranma skidding back, wrring in anger and pain.</p><p>Forearms…Biceps…Triceps…Knuckles…Shoulders…Chest…Legs…</p><p>Koryu focused all his remaining energy through each area, his strands of hair separating with very instant, his eyes widening, his brow creasing dangerously, and dashed forward again for another round.</p><p>He performed a sliding sweep, to which his opponent jumped high and away to the side. Koryu jammed his feet into the ground and stopped sliding that instant, tore of again to try and catch Ranma in mid air.</p><p>He was not caught off guard when Neko-Ranma twisted in mid air and slashed again. Koryu caught the martial artist in his shins, ignoring the searing pain surging through his legs – the ki claws had been further extended – brought the martial artist close to him and collided a ki filled, disrupting palm across his opponent's face.</p><p>He watched in slim satisfaction when he felt, for a fleeting second, the ki try to push away his limb, but failing miserably. Neko-Ranma let out a small exclamation at the force of the blow before reversing vectors and slamming into the ground, <b>hard.</b></p><p>Koryu landed moments later.</p><p>He crouched low and grinned with some amusement. At least he had gotten the cat back for slapping him. That had been one of his hardest punches too. It should have easily incapacitated Ranma, no matter the ki he had protecting him.</p><p>Disrupting energy – or ki - patterns was one of Koryu's more effective techniques. That blow was taken at point blank without protection. It was sure to rattle some brain cells, for it had easily broken through the swirling ki shield surrounding Ranma.</p><p>Though Koryu knew that wasn't the purpose of the swirling – it was mainly used to keep the ki from dispersing and being wasted – but the side effect of it helped protect Ranma.</p><p>Koryu stayed on guard still, not wanting further surprises. He crouched and walked slowly, silently towards the small crater. For once, the cat hadn't landed on its feet. What a pity.</p><p>He stopped a few feet short, and leaped to the side rolling on the ground to come out in a low stance again. Lucky move, for he saw three flaring blades rip through his previous position.</p><p>Apparently Ranma had a hard head.</p><p>Koryu didn't care anymore. This fight was causing too much commotion. He slipped a hand under the back of his shirt; easily withdrawing three tranq-darts from their mini leather holster strapped on his back and placed them between his digits.</p><p>He jumped to the side and accurately threw them towards where could easily see Ranma now, and rolled again, making sure to keep a low center of gravity. Neko-Ranma turned slowly, hissing towards his current ire, and leaped – completely destroying the ground beneath him.</p><p>Koryu strengthened his guard and took the blow head on; using what aura he had to create a strong guard. He successfully managed to block the ki based claws using his forearms. He ignored the fact that the ground beneath him was giving way, cracking up and breaking apart.</p><p>What an incredibly compressed aura. Twisting himself, the ninja coiled his arms around the Saotome's wrists and gripped down with all the strength he had. With a sneer he focused everything he had into a flash kick straight into Ranma's abdomen, watching again as his opponent flew backwards hissing in pain.</p><p>Instead of waiting, Koryu fished the last three of his darts and closed the distance between the two. He needed to stop this fight now!</p><p>After taking another few quick, carefully calculated steps, he froze. Not in fear, but in pain. He felt his legs go cold, and chest seize up, and an felt an intense migraine start up its engines.</p><p>He wasn't sure if a drag race was due in his head, but he didn't have the mind to dwell on it. A slow feeling of warm liquid gather around his throat area made itself known to him. Moments later, he found himself coughing on his knees, spurting out the small amount of blood that had accumulated in his mouth.</p><p>This was not good. Not good at all. How foolish could he be! Had he completely forgotten his limitations? A feeling of dread came over him when he felt his senses flicker. He looked up, seeing that he was standing in his opponent's shadow, whom was now staring and hissing at him in no polite way.</p><p>Koryu blinked at his opponent. "Umm, could we start over? Hi! I'm Koryu, the guy with the chicken? You don't want to make mince meat out of me, do you?"</p><p>Okay, that just aggravated the situation, Koryu wondered reluctantly at the hissing boy, while Ranma-Neko glared down menacingly at his adversary, baring his teeth.</p><p style="text-align:center;">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>She shifted her legs one more time and patiently waited for him to complete the session with his patients, wondering how one could never noticed the idle things. She had been in Dr. Tofu's clinic countless times, yet she hadn't noticed the small painting of a swan in the waiting area. Was it new?</p><p>It was pinned up at average height – a surprise really, for people usually pin them up real high – so one would view the painting at a casual glance. Well, the truth of the matter was, Kasumi had never waited before. Any time she ever came, every patient that <i>was </i>waiting had left, more like ran for their lives?</p><p>It never occurred to her, but never had she come across a time when Dr. Tofu had closed his clinic, of course apart from the times she visited. Could it be that to offset the lack of his availability due to his…condition…he never closed the office?</p><p>That was awfully sweet of him. A dedicated man, Kasumi absently smiled to herself. She even remembered a couple of times when she needed extra books in the evening– and found the clinic to be open.</p><p>Then she frowned, thinking up ahead – far too ahead – at what the possibilities could be. If everything worked out like it was supposed to, would it be too difficult to have a man very dedicated to his work? Even though it was much too embarrassing for her to reflect upon, she did feel that she'd want him to be as dedicated to her. It would only be fair, for all purposes. She would be completely dedicated too.</p><p>The thought of working as a nurse lingered in the brown haired girl's mind for a moment, before taking the back door out.</p><p>Kasumi didn't particularly like the idea. She knew basic and emergency medication skills, only because of Akane – and now Ranma. Hmm, now there was another dedicated-</p><p>Kasumi stopped her thoughts right there. Maybe she was blowing things out of proportion, but never the less she needed to concentrate on the task at hand.</p><p>Caning back suddenly, Kasumi widened her eyes, as if someone had just splashed her with cold water. When had this become a task?</p><p>Her musings were cut short when she heard the definitive voices of the Doctor and his patients become louder and closer. Moments later, the door to Dr Tofu's visitation room opened to let two elderly couple out, followed by the good doctor himself.</p><p>However, the moment the two couple saw Kasumi their eyes went round and they almost disappeared. It surprised Kasumi, and startled the Doctor, at how the two could move at such speeds given their age.</p><p>The good Doctor turned to face them and for the first time noticed the looks on their faces, huddled together as they were in a corner of the room.</p><p>They were pretty scared. He then turned to look at Kasumi, becoming a little flustered at her sight, but somehow controlling himself at the last moment.</p><p>"Ah, K-Ka-Kasumi, what brings you here?" he began abruptly, though he seemed to relax as his stuttered greeting managed to elicit a warm smile from the young girl. That smile almost seemed to set him back into his previous inhibition, but was contained.</p><p>The elderly couple, who were staring in between the two, started sweating, and after a moment of intense 'watching live tennis' maneuvers, the elder woman slowly made her way towards Kasumi. She laid a gentle hand on her shoulder, causing the young girl to regard her in question.</p><p>"Congratulations." The old woman said, "Finally the prayers have been answered." She looked quite like Christmas had come early.</p><p>Kasumi smiled slightly, but her eyes had started doting on the nearby painting all of a sudden. "Thank you." she said in a small voice.</p><p>The elderly couple stood momentarily before saying their goodbyes and, rather quickly, rushing out of the clinic. Kasumi assumed, with a smile, that they didn't really trust the Doctor's control.</p><p>She couldn't find it in herself to fault them. Smiling gently towards the door one more time, Kasumi turned to the Doctor. She smiled shyly at his somewhat itchy attempts to control himself.</p><p>"Um-uh- Hi. Kasumi, what brings you here?" He began again. The sweat on how brow could be easily seen. Was it too much for her to come again so soon? No. She needed to break him out of his condition, so she could finally see the real man that he was. Or what she hoped.</p><p>"I came to..." Kasumi started, and then in a rare display of adverse emotion, she frowned.</p><p>"Why do you think I came?"</p><p>"Uh, I do remember you having a few books. You wanted to return them? Please come in."</p><p>Kasumi sighed, and held her 'books' out as she followed the doctor inside. When she reached him, she gently placed the two pieces of literature in his hands.</p><p>It was Dr Tofu's turn to frown, then, as he realized that the two novels in his hands were not of any in he had his collection. There was a momentary silence as the doctor apparently tried to make heads or tails of the situation.</p><p>Kasumi almost scratched her elbow in consternation when she saw Dr. Tofu look up from the books. It seemed quite miraculous, actually. There was no sweat, no foggy glasses, and no lines on his forehead. What surprised her most was the incredibly gentle, caring smile she had ever seen, light up on his face.</p><p>It was so surprising in fact, that she almost didn't take notice that his eyes were directed toward her own. They were soft, and Kasumi could swear she he was giving off this exceptionally warm, caressing aura. It made her slightly giddy, and she fleetingly tried to keep her balance.</p><p>Suddenly a loud crash echoed through the small clinic, breaking both out of their trance, followed by a clearly distraught, distinctly feminine voice.</p><p>"Dr. Tofu!"</p><p>"Ranma?" Kasumi gasped, moving away immediately from the doctor's personal space, unconsciously moving a hand to her hair as if to make sure they were not disheveled. She felt swift movement, and after being gently pushed aside, Kasumi noticed the doctor had already passed through the doorway.</p><p>Had Kasumi's mind had not been completely muddled with confusing emotions; she would have felt impressed at the Doctor's professional attitude in his instantaneous response to the urgency in Ranma's voice.</p><p>"Ranma! What's?" Kasumi made to follow the medical practitioner but just as she reached the doorway, she was roughly pushed aside by a very weary Ranma carrying a body on his shoulders followed by the Doctor.</p><p>"This way Ranma!"</p><p>Completely lost, Kasumi bewilderedly turned around to catch sight of Dr. Tofu hurriedly directing Ranma to an adjacent room. She could make out as Ranma almost ran towards the directed location and placing the body down on the bed.</p><p>It was only then when she realized who that body belonged to.</p><p>"Koryu!" Kasumi quickly followed the two. When she reached the bed she took a quick glance at the body, and felt a little relieved. There were no apparent serious bruises or cuts. Upon intense scrutiny, she noticed that he was quite heavily scratched though, and had a few long cuts along his forearms.</p><p>They were easily dismissible, for even from her rather limited medial medical experience from treating Akane and Ranma; those cuts were shallow and wouldn't take too long to heal. She quickly glanced at Ranma, who had retreated to the back wall and was proceeding to lean on it for support, and wondered why Dr Tofu was murmuring to himself while deftly examining the body.</p><p>She looked back at Koryu. It was only a moment later, and with a visible surprise, that Kasumi realized what was wrong.</p><p>"But he's…he" She began, unable to complete the sentence. Kasumi turned on her heel and briskly walked to Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma…Ranma! What happened?"</p><p>It took a moment to get Ranma out of his stupor and to look into her face, and a slight trace of recognition light his – her face. It was only then that she realized he truly hadn't known she was there.</p><p>"Huh? Kasumi?" Ranma said wearily? "What're ya doin' here?"</p><p>"Let's leave that for now." Kasumi struggled to keep the worry from her voice. "What happened? How did Koryu get so exhausted? His life force is almost gone!"</p><p>It was obvious that Ranma was obviously deluded, or extremely exhausted, for his answer was slurry. She would have thought Ranma drunk, were she to smell any alcoholic odor.</p><p>"Dun know…" Ranma began, "some weird, ca' spiri' or somethin'… then waking up in the canal. " she said sloppily, and then sat down clutching her stomach tight, before groaning.</p><p>The elder girl winced uncharacteristically, realizing full well what was currently causing the young martial artist pain. Without wasting another thought, she made her way to the Doctor's medicine cabinet, intent on creating an immediate remedy.</p><p>She had never felt to be in such a state of emergency, and to her surprise, even her usually steady hand shivered when she was quickly making a quick drink for Ranma.</p><p>It had only taken a moment to clean the thermos Dr. Tofu used for tea.</p><p>Firstly, she told herself, the boy – turned – girl needed fluids in the body. She hastily took out a several Vitamin-C dissolvable tablets and added it to the concoction; silently praying the 'potion' would not have any side effects. Her basic knowledge in medicine told her the ingredients of this potion would not react with each other.</p><p>The moment she filled the thermos up with water, she closed the cap tightly and shook it while heading back to Ranma. It was difficult to make the young boy drink in his current condition, but he did as he was forced, albeit spilling the drink idly.</p><p>It would take several minutes for the effects of the drink to be ascertained, and she didn't know if Ranma would immediately start feeling much better. Upon glancing at the aqua transsexual more carefully, she noticed Ranma had severe bruises all over her arms; her shirt was almost in tatters while she sported several bruises.</p><p>In an attempt to keep the teenager awake, Kasumi gently took his head in her hands, and tenderly rolled it around. " Ranma, Ranma! Can you tell me anything else?" She was about to use a bit more force when she felt a small mound protruding from the side of his neck.</p><p>Judging that to be strange, the brown eyed girl leaned in to investigate. It turned out to be a tiny pin, which looked remarkably like a thumb tack used to pin up papers. The only difference that could be distinguished was the plastic end – which didn't seem like plastic at all, for it even felt heavy ; it was elongated and curves were placed on adjacent sides of it – almost making look like a convex lens- if only it was see through.</p><p>To examine the tip of it in more closely, Kasumi held the item up in between her thumb and index finger. Her shivering had not yet stopped, obviously, because moments later she was fumbling. Luckily though, the girl caught the pin again between her middle and index finger.</p><p>Ironically, it fit perfectly, as if it was made to be held in that position.</p><p>Kasumi stared at her hand. Then she turned to look at Ranma, and finally around to glance at Koryu. It made too much sense.</p><p>Ranma's stomach condition, involvement of a cat, the scratches on Koryu's body, Ranma's bruises, and finally this apparent throwing pin was too much of a coincidence. The only logical explanation Kasumi has in mind was Ranma had somehow turned into a cat, and somehow found Koryu and attacked.</p><p>She didn't claim to know the inner workings of Ranma's Cat psyche, but she could understand the pain the animal would have gone through, and it would have easily made the cat Ranma very irritable.</p><p>And Koryu ended up getting involved, though he had been able to curse Ranma out of the Neko Ken.</p><p>This was all her fault.</p><p>"Kasumi!"</p><p>The distressed woman flipped around briskly at her name. Dr. Tofu was giving her an inquisitive glance. "Ah... what is it Doctor? Will he be alright?"</p><p>Dr. Tofu's glance stayed on the girl for a moment longer, before he adjusted his glasses idly, and gestured towards the limp body. "He should be fine. For some reason, he's expended all his energy, but his vitals are still working, if worn out. There's little I can do for him, apart from assigning a glucose drip. He'll need his strength. He's suffered nothing particularly damaging, physically at least. Minor cuts and bruises. I'm surprised. I believe this is the first opponent that's gotten away from the Neko-Ken with this less physical damage, am I right? I have no idea what happened to his life force though. My best assessment is he exhausted himself keeping away from the ki-based claws that Ranma is supposed to generate when in that…state." the doctor moved towards Kasumi, and kneeled next to her, and glanced at Ranma, then at the pin in her hand. "More importantly. Are you alright? You seemed out of it a moment ago. You weren't responding to my calls."</p><p>Kasumi seemed surprised. "Really? Sorry, It's just…this caught me by surprise."</p><p>The doctor chuckled gently, relaxing Kasumi, and making her feel a little warm. "Surprise? I assumed you would have gotten used to it by now." He gestured towards the sleeping form of Ranma, who by now was easily snoring away to China.</p><p>"I suppose, but this, I really wasn't expecting. And, to make it worse, I think this is my fault."</p><p>Tofu looked at her inquisitively. "Please explain, if you don't mind, that is." He said after a moment, and moved forward to pick Ranma up from her place against the wall. The two went back to his main consultancy room, and the doctor proceeded to place Ranma on the ground while placing a blow a pillow under his head.</p><p>Sighing deeply, Kasumi turned towards the doctor and began explaining the recent events.</p><p style="text-align:center;">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p style="text-align:center;">UPDATED 25/07/07</p><p style="text-align:center;">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>How long it took to explain, she wasn't sure, but it felt like hardly any had passed until Kasumi regurgitated the entire story to the Doctor. The only difference being that Dr. Tofu didn't know Koryu was from another 'world'. He just knew that he was a visitor and Ranma had challenged him to a fight.</p><p>Kasumi knew this wasn't the best of plans, but she was short on time, and was already under stress for causing Ranma his duress. She wasn't able to come up with anything else, but it was the only thing that was most believable. He was supposedly Kasumi's friend after all and did some martial arts. She was curious that Dr. Tofu didn't ask about the 'relationship' between her and Koryu, but didn't dwell on it.</p><p>She had just finished explaining the 'punishment' she had for Ranma's lateness the other day and the result when they heard the door to the clinic open.</p><p>"Dr. Tofu? Are you there?"</p><p>"Ah, it seems they've made their way here." Dr. Tofu said, amused, and silently moved to close the door to the room with Koryu as Kasumi quickly walked out of the room to meet Akane.</p><p>"Kasumi?" Akane asked, "What are you doing here?" She was not alone, Kasumi noticed, as Ukyo stood adjacent to her.</p><p>"Oh, I just came to visit Dr. Tofu."</p><p>A small smile tugged on Akane's face, before it dissolved into slight worry. "Have you seen Ranma?"</p><p>Kasumi remained poker faced, and thought quickly. "Yes." She said calmly. "I found Ranma on my way here. He seemed to be in the afflicted in the neko-ken."</p><p>"He didn't attack you?" The question came from Ukyo, who wore a worried yet disgruntled expression.</p><p>Kasumi tilted her head. "Why on earth would he attack me?"</p><p>Both girls looked at her for a moment before Akane cut across, "So what happened? Where is he now?"</p><p>"Oh…Mrs. Ariyama was out for the second time of day putting water on her door step. Poor Ranma got drenched again. But he seemed to get back to normal.  Apparently he had something that did not sit well with his stomach, so we both came here."</p><p>"Here? Really? Where is he?"</p><p>"Ah, I'm afraid he's resting at the moment." Said Dr. Tofu as he walked out of his office carefully closing the door behind him. "I slipped some sedatives into the drink that I gave him. He seemed to have exhausted quite a bit of his ki, but didn't want to rest."</p><p>He gave a sigh. "Young blood. So, I am assuming you know what happened?"</p><p>Both girls nodded, and a little confused Ukyo looked at the Doctor, then at Kasumi. "Uh, aren't…" Glancing back at the doctor, she said, "Why aren't you going nuts? I thought you were supposed to do that when she was around?"</p><p>Both Kasumi and Dr. Tofu looked a little flustered at the question, seemingly unable to say anything "Ah well," the Doctor began.</p><p>"We'll explain our situation later." Kasumi said smoothly. "But what happened to poor Ranma?"<p>"Huh? Oh… well, Ran-chan and Kuno fought again. Of course Ran-chan kicked ass but this time it looks like Kuno got himself possessed by a cat spirit to beat Ranma. From what I can tell, this massive green aura tried to take over Ran-chan, and I think it almost did but then Ran-chan went cat and drove that aura away."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>Ukyo looked at Akane for a moment, and younger Tendo continued the story, "Well… then Ranma ran away while Kuno lay flat on the ground. So is he okay? I mean, he usually comes to me when I ask for him but this time…" Akane trailed off, unsure.</p><p>The doctor smiled. "Oh, he's fine. I only insisted he stay because he never does, does he? Moving around with an upset stomach isn't smart and we all know what sort of trouble Ranma can get into. Besides, I haven't managed to properly evaluate him since his return from China."</p><p>The comment set off gloomy weather as both younger girls stared at the floor slightly downcast. Dr. Tofu immediately realized his mistake and move to rectify it . "So, anyways… do any of you have any idea what he might have had recently that made his stomach like this?"</p><p>The question was very general and quite honest, but it caused Ukyo give Akane a half lidded stare from the corner of her eyes. Akane retorted testily. "Hey! Everyone ate my meal. They all liked it, and no one else's stomach is upset!"</p><p>"Akane." Kasumi said, "No one is suggesting that it's your fault. Ranma could have gotten anything even after that, and we all know how much he likes to eat."</p><p>Akane deflated slightly. "Well, I don't know where that baka goes to get food half the time. He usually to Ukyo's or Nekohaten for food. " Her voice sounded tired.</p><p>"He hasn't been to my restaurant lately, sugar. I'm sure he hasn't been to the Nekohaten except that last visit with us." Ukyo commented.</p><p>"Well, we'll ask him when he wakes up. He should be up later on this evening and I'll send him back. Is that okay? Don't you girls still have school?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess. I'm just happy nothing else happened. I figured this was going to be another one of those days." Ukyo said.</p><p>Akane sighed, "Yeah…" She glanced momentarily towards Dr. Tofu's Office. "Can we look over Ranma? I hope because of him you're time is not getting wasted."</p><p>"Don't be silly, Akane." Kasumi smiled. "We're fine. You go ahead back to school. You're studies are quite important right now."</p><p>Akane glanced between the two, seeing Dr. Tofu nod in response.</p><p>"Okay…"</p><p>Both girls said their goodbyes, and after existing the clinic, and jogged back to school. It was after a few minutes of Ukyo of constantly stealing glances toward Akane, the short haired girl got a little miffed. "What is it?" she asked.</p><p>"Since when?"</p><p>"Since when what?"</p><p>"Since when have those two been…you know."</p><p>"Oh," Akane said, in thought, ignoring the people on sidewalk as both of them weaved through a small crowd. "Well, they only started a few days ago… Kasumi's trying to be a bit more forward with Dr. Tofu I think."</p><p>"Heh, taking a leaf out of our book huh?" Ukyo commented dryly. Akane didn't respond, and the two ran silently back to school.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Back in the clinic, both Kasumi and Dr. Tofu had headed back to the office, where Ranma lay. Both looked at one another in silence.</p><p>"Well?" Kasumi asked, at length.</p><p>"I need to examine Koryu a little more. Let Ranma rest here, where I can extract the whole story from him when he awakens. I also need to run a few tests on that pin you found. I'm not sure if I have all the equipment for this…" The Doctor let out a long sigh. "I'm terribly sorry. I'm sure we were…both hoping for better things this evening. Believe me that it was a very pleasant surprise to see you today. You've… well…"</p><p>Kasumi smiled brilliantly, tilting her head to the side. "Please, I got to see more of you. I'm happy." Her smile lessened a bit, "I just hope everything is alright. Thank you, Ono-san. I do appreciate you helping me with the story."</p><p>"I didn't do anything."</p><p>"Yes you did. Thank you."</p><p>Kasumi glanced toward Ranma once more, before heading outside accompanied by the Doctor. The two bid farewell and shortly later the doctor entered back into his office.</p><p>It had taken the rest of the day to thoroughly examine Ranma and Koryu, which included taking blood samples and studying each person's ki structure, bone joints and ligament health. It was after this then when he studied their entire anatomy, from a completely martial arts stand point.</p><p>He examined Koryu first. The man just seemed physically exhausted. He had one laceration on his arm which was taken care of, and some smaller cuts, which Tofu presumed were Ranma's ki claws. He did wonder how the battle must have turned out.</p><p>When he examined Ranma, what had him quite worried were Ranma's two arms. One had suffered heat, while the other had suffered cold. They were clearly ki based effects, which Tofu dismissed as a new technique. From his standpoint, Kuno, possessed or not, would not be able to generate such complex levels of ki manipulation. Ranma did suffer a mild concussion and a bruise on his arm.</p><p>"Always causing trouble, aren't you? I wonder what star you were born under."  Tofu's voice was gentle. "Of course, now you're getting very powerful Ranma. You're brining bystanders into your life and getting them hurt. Koryu must be something to have survived you." His smile lessened as he placed his middle and index fingers at Ranma's throat, just above the trachea.</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, as sweat appeared on his brow. His hand started to shiver slightly.</p><p>"Ah," He said suddenly in a slightly amused and gently surprised voice. "You're awake." Tofu frowned momentarily, and continued talking to the air. "I would suggest you get some more rest. You're not physically well. There is the aspect of your blood. I may only be a chiropractor, but…I have had enough knowledge and experience to know that everything is not alright."</p><p>"Move away."  Was his response. It was a weary voice, but firm. Very firm.</p><p>Tofu complied, removing his fingers and moving back from Ranma. He turned around to see Koryu standing opposite the room, leaning against the wall next to the doctor's desk, both hands in his pockets. His posture certainly gave an air of relaxation.</p><p>His eyes were a different matter altogether. Sharp and crisp and aimed directly into his own. Tofu shuddered after starting into them for a few seconds, shaking his head away and glancing down.</p><p>"Interesting technique." Tofu ventured.</p><p>"So's yours." Koryu said, moving away from the wall and almost stumbling. Dr. Tofu immediately moved to the injured man, catching him. "I was under the impression that I left you in the other room with the door closed." He caught a quick glance of the said door, noticing that it was indeed closed.</p><p>Koryu didn't move to block the Doctor in any way and leaned onto the older man, though his eyes remained fixated on the doc. "I won't let you hurt him."</p><p>The doctor seemed surprised again. "What makes you think I'll hurt him?" With a serious undertone he added "and what makes you think you can do anything in your condition even if I decide to?"</p><p>"You'll be surprised."</p><p>"I'm sure. Please sit down."</p><p>Koryu remained standing up, and with the doctor's help, moved towards the other side of the room where Ranma lay, leaning against the wall again as Tofu moved back, looking at the young man again with somewhat surprised eyes.</p><p>"You seem adamant about keeping Ranma safe, when you're the one who needs more attention. Also, wasn't Ranma the one who put you in your condition?"</p><p>"I can safely say we both know he's not responsible for that." Koryu said calmly, his eyes never leaving the doctor. "Besides it wasn't that hard. I would've taken care of him, but …"</p><p>"You're blood I presume?"</p><p>Koryu's eyes narrowed slightly. "You're not just a chiropractor are you?"</p><p>"No, not really, I suppose. I have done extensive research on other aspects… but I am a chiropractor by profession." Tofu replied calmly. "Well, for one thing, it is a truly pleasant surprise to see someone protecting Ranma instead of trying to kill him. His cat psyche nearly killed you."</p><p>"Well, I don't care much for fighting…and it's not his cat psyche I'm worried about."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Koryu sighed. "He's just an animal. If I was to worry, it would be if Ranma learned to fight with such ferocity and tenacity."</p><p>Koryu seemed a little surprise at seeing the doctor laugh. "You've never upset Ranma greatly have you?</p><p>Koryu gave the doctor a curious look. "No, I do not think I have."</p><p>"You don't want to."</p><p>"I'm sure." Koryu said calmly, and gave a hard stare towards the doc. "So tell me, who taught you 'Anything Goes'?"</p><p>For the first time, Koryu smiled, noting the blank look on Doctor's face.</p><p></p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Got married, Changed Jobs, Changed Careers .Yeah yeah, pathetic excuses, but still… all that true. Sorry for the delay. I AM still alive. And this story is going to get completed. I just completed this chapter. Sorry if it does seem rushed.</p><p>I'm getting this story back up and moving on.</p><p>Sorry for any mistakes, I haven't had the time to send this to my pre-readers. New readers, the early chapters are very long… and need to be refined. I hope my writing has improved enough for you to continue reading.</p><p>Thank you for your time. Please read and review, as it greatly helps in motivating me and letting me understand your thoughts.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Syncron-</p>
