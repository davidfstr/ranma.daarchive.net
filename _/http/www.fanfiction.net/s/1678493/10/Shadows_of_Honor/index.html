</div>Chapter 10: An evening out / Koryu's History / Ranma's Development<p>"Thanks come again!"<p>Ukyo cheerfully said goodbye to another satisfied customer as he left her restaurant. Another day had gone pretty well, in terms of sales. She was earning quite a bit. Most of the Furinkan students went to either U-Chan's or to the Neko-Haten for lunch, since the school food was apparently not good enough.<p>Ukyo wanted to go somewhere tonight and decided to shut down her restaurant early. Usually it was open till late hours. A slight change in a while wouldn't matter. With her mind made up, the young girl walked over to the main door and languidly twisted the closed door sign with her slender fingers, kept in fine shape even if she worked hard at the art.<p>After closing down the shop, and turning off most of the lights, Ukyo sat down in one of the seats...calculating how much she needed to get out of her savings to go to university. Heck, she had begun wondering if she needed a degree or not.<p>She liked the idea of doing more in terms of academics but her big dream of owning a massive restaurant one day, Ranma there to take care of the children and help her around with the restaurant...every thing would be so nice.<p>Ranma...<p>Those thoughts now only brought sadness.<p>She so wanted Ranma to wake up and realize that Akane was not meant for him. Her involvement in the failed wedding had made him angrier than he had ever seen her. He had said that he had not truly forgiven her yet, but he was still willing to talk to her, so that must be an acceptable sign.<p>In the past two weeks Ranma had not shown any hostility towards Ukyo, but then again, he hadn't shown any hostility towards Shampoo or even Kodachi.<p>Ukyo shuddered at the mere thought of the latter girl.<p>The young okonomiyaki chef was sure Ranma needed some time to come to his senses. After the entire affair, he needed to realize that someone who kept on beating him or almost killing him with her cooking wouldn't be someone he wants to get married to.<p>Married...At the sight of the wedding, seeing Ranma and Akane all ready, ready to live their lives together hit Ukyo like a ton of bricks. It was later revealed that Ranma was baited into the wedding because of the Nanichuan. She wished it was true.<p>She wondered then whether Ranma would have accepted the marriage without that specific persuasion. Her heart was screaming 'no way', but even amongst the screaming, she could clearly hear the whisper of her logical mind saying, 'He probably would.'<p>Ukyo shook her head rapidly, to get some fresh thoughts in her mind, well at least those that won't totally mess up her mood.<p>Still...<p>The impact of the whole affair had not left Ukyo's mind though. She always wanted to get married and especially to Ranma. She was his cute fiancée, but apart from that, she was also his best friend. If Ranma ever got past those points, he would eventually realize that she truly cared for him. The time they spent together was always fun. They hardly got into arguments. Of course she didn't want to get married off so quickly.<p>She might even go to university after all; maybe she'll be ready in a few years. Truth be told, she became scared when she saw all the preparation that went into the wedding. The thought of getting married found her slightly cold footed.<p>They could be fiancées for a few years until Ranma got a bit used to the idea of marriage and they would easily get hitched. They already were fiancées, weren't they?<p>The chance of that happening was small. Right now she needed to give Ranma some space. If she would not bother him for a while, unless of course it's something for his benefit, he would realize that to be married, one would need to be friends first.<p>It was all Genma's fault. That damn GENMA! He must be going though some sort of training to make him more stupid...no doubt to try and beat Ranma so he could force him into marriage again. Everybody was training. That old Amazon woman was also training Mousse and Shampoo; they had even come to ask her to train if she wanted.<p>She didn't know why they wanted her to train with them. They obviously wouldn't want a rival to try and become stronger. Something was going on over there as well.<p>Kodachi had not been around, so there was definitely some sort of trickery being planned in her insane mind.<p>Her brother, Tatewaki Kuno had been busy with a few students today. Ranma had been too distracted with his 'other' problems to notice the Furunkan True Blunder talking to that meek looking kid, Gosunkugi. It could be nothing, but then again with Kuno and his high and mighty, not to mention stupid, attitude, there was no way he would be dealing with the student unless there was something going on.<p>So many things going on, everyone had their plans, every one wanted one thing.<p>Ranma.<p>It was only time before everything crash landed on top of Ranma's head. She just hoped it wouldn't all happen at once. Ranma would definitely go crazy. He had destroyed an entire mountain in China. There was no telling what would happen if he lost control here.<p>Well if he needed someone, she would be there. She would be a friend. Eventually he would realize what is really required for someone to be so close to you that you would choose to marry them.<p>The young girl sighed, trying to get her mind off such matters. She would continue to be on the lookout for Ranma's sake. That's right; she needed to tell him that Mr. Tendo had gone to visit his father today. Well she'd do that tomorrow.<p>Instead of brooding right now, Ukyo decided to divert her mind on other things, namely profits.<p>The profits and the success of the shop had always been something to cheer her up. She was no Nabiki Tendo, but the prospect of succeeding in part of her dream was always a welcome thought. Lately however, it was the only thing making her feel better.<p>Getting up from her seat, the okonomiyaki chef went upstairs to change out of her work clothes and into something more comfortable. She didn't have that big of a ward robe, but it existed. After changing into a summer dress she'd originally bought to impress Ranma, she decided to go to the carnival. It may not be the best thing, but it had to make do.<p>Maybe someday she wouldn't go alone.<p>At Downtown Tokyo, the Golden Dragon restaurant, the love interest of four girls, sat with his companions quietly waiting for the drinks to be served.<p>Kasumi was sitting next to him on an extravagant, lush couch with a glass table in front of them. Koryu sat on the opposite side in a similar couch.<p>They had moved from the original location that Kasumi had chosen to private quarters that were deeper in to the restaurant, offering complete privacy. Kasumi seemed reluctant to move, but Koryu persuaded her. To be specific, he dragged her all the way, much to her embarrassment.<p>Ranma, being slightly oblivious to their behavior, quietly followed them to the place where two guards were sitting. They got up, bowed to Koryu and his guests and let them in.<p>"Oh my, Koryu, you certainly seem like a Yakuza, don't you?" Kasumi commented, putting one knee on top of the other, giving an impression of high class that Nabiki would have a hard time mimicking.<p>"Hmm? Naa, Yakuza are way below me. I work on a much higher level back home. I monitor them from time to time back home.<p>"Arrogance seems to be a common trait between the two of you doesn't it?" the girl looked at Ranma and Koryu.<p>"Hey, arrogance on its own is bad for you. But on occasion, if it is supported by facts, then it's alright. I did, after all, just state a fact."<p>"Who do you deal with, like what do ya do?" asked Ranma. He didn't like getting into conversations he didn't know about, but curiosity got the better of him. "Like you take out terrorists or like go on spy missions in other countries or what?"<p>"Hmm...I could tell you...but then I'd have to ...kill you." Koryu chuckled at his over used joke and continued, "Eh. Just kidding. Anyways, I do on occasion go abroad, but I don't really work against governments or such. It's the year 2060 in our time, so it's a pretty advanced world. Surprisingly its not all that advanced as people in the old times thought it would be. We're not like flying from place to place or anything. Anyways there are lots of people using technology for not so good reasons. It's my task force's job to stop 'em. Of course it's not that simple." explained Koryu, comfortably leaning back into couch. He raised an eyebrow at their lack of enthusiasm and wondered if they really interested in his world.<p>"That's it? So you're some kinda tech cop right?"<p>"Hah...funny Ranma. These people are funded and provided by large organizations with some serious technological advanced equipment. Shit thing is they're all mainly weaponry."<p>"So? I mean, wouldn't the police be able to handle this?" asked Kasumi.<p>"Let's just say, these organizations are big enough to topple some smaller governments, financially and in weaponry."<p>The look of shock that passed through Kasumi's face was not something he wanted, but she did ask the question. Ranma seemed to understand the idea, by his apparent serious look.<p>"Also, these organizations are always trying to get help from one another...always trying to succeed in some development of some sort that always smells trouble for the public, especially if something goes wrong. We basically clean up their mess and make sure that anything doesn't fall into the wrong hands. They're currently trying to make fighting robots. Messing with them is not a walk in the park. They're programmed with all the moves from many martial arts styles. These are basically prototyped for war and stuff. I'm sure you will understand if I can't just tell you specifics. I am not allowed to, even if I'm not from this world.<p>"So why don't you tell them to stop making weapons like that." Ranma leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees.<p>"Hah! Business. If there are people to buy, there are people to make. There is a large market for weapons and robots for working in heavy duty environments. Some governments want robotic scouts or such to deal with terrorists or anything like that. So we can't stop the manufacturing. We have orders to only make sure nothing falls into wrong hands. We can't just go in and stop them. You see, the technology that is being used for weapons can also be used for medical or other benefits. Robots operate in hazardous environments, thus saving injuries or lives. There are laws...of course, but our job is to catch the people who break those laws. We can't disobey our orders." Koryu winked.<p>"So what? If lots of people get hurt, then it's better not to have that kind of stuff at all." Ranma argued. Not understanding clearly what the real problem was. If they got rid of it, then it wouldn't be a problem.<p>Granted, Ranma had lived most of his life on the road, but he knew that some things were better left alone. In fact, that was one of the things he had learned the hard way. Things that were sugar coated usually had a bitter aftertaste in Ranma's experience.<p>"So says a person who doesn't have the guts to tell off his fiancées, father and mother whenever they want him doing something he doesn't wish."<p>Kasumi sat there turning her head from Ranma to Koryu intently listening to the young men. She partly understood Koryu's explanation and didn't want to to seem nosy as to prod into his personal life back home. 'If he wished to tell, I would be happy to listen.' She thought, quickly downing the wine glass. 'Funny, I don't seem to remember how many times I've refilled.'      Kasumi shifted her concern to how Koryu had retorted Ranma's claim about banishing all such advanced technology. Anything that is developed by technology can be used in a bad way. Kasumi wondered what would be if society worked according to what Ranma said. 'Oh my, I guess no kitchen knives then huh?' she thought, amused.<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes at Koryu, knowing that the man had made a point. Half of him wanted to calm down and take it slowly but the other half, which has been in charge of his pride, couldn't let it slip by.<p>"Hey, I can't! I'm honor bound," Ranma began quickly," well kind of. I'll change that soon though. I have to find a way to break off all engagements. The problem is I dun think I'm strong enough if I end up fighting everyone. Besides, I want to have some time to relax before I cause a mess again. We only came back from China several weeks ago. I need to get some sort of control. I dun wanna hurt nobody more than required.—ow,ow."<p>Kasumi pulled Ranma's ear again looking at him with mock anger, before smiling sweetly at him again.<p>"Sweetheart, you are supposed to honor your promises, like the one you made to me about improving your talking habits?"<p>"Ah... Yea...Yes... Sorry," Ranma eyed the wine glass on the table in front of her. It had been emptied and refilled three times already.<p>Turning his head slightly to look at Kasumi, Ranma sighed. At least this was Kasumi, not one of the other girls. First and foremost, she wouldn't take advantage of this situation in any way to steal a kiss or something else. She wouldn't even jump to conclusions, even if she was slightly tipsy at the moment.<p>Koryu chuckled at the display in front of him. 'They would make an amazing couple.' he thought. The only issue that would arise would be that pain would be caused inside the family. Such situations cause serious divisions in all families, and he assumed Kasumi would understand that.<p>Having two brothers fall for the same girl or two girls for the same guy, either way does the same thing: it causes rifts in the family.<p>Koryu felt that she would not really try to let that happen. She loved her family too much. Yet, Koryu mused, she seemed to be subconsciously becoming closer to Ranma and opening up to him. Being a girl who has live mostly sheltered, even with her rare excursions that she did have, Koryu figured Kasumi would indeed give in to her desires, eventually.<p>She was a young woman after all. She also had a heart.<p>When someone really falls in love, they can do stupid things. Chances were unknown though. Kasumi would easily sacrifice her own happiness for her family's sake as she has done so for a while, a trait similar to Koryu himself.<p>Koryu turned slightly to look at Ranma, who was doing a mock bow towards Kasumi and asking her to give him a little time to adjust. 'The problem would be him. In the end he will only go for what he really wants. Damn, your love life is more complicated than my work and that's saying something.' Koryu laughed inwardly.<p>Koryu thought Ranma should just run away. Running away won't necessarily be cowardly if Ranma would state clearly to everyone after him to take that time to forget him and carry on with their life as if he didn't exist.<p>It could just be considered a strategic retreat or a vacation. A few years away could iron out many issues and give these people needed to grow up. They all were immature, with the exceptions being Kasumi and perhaps Ranma.<p>Kasumi would be considered an adult because of her age and responsibility, Ranma would because of his experiences. He might act childish as a result of his conditioning, but there was a big difference between the Ranma now and the Ranma Koryu had seen a few days ago.<p>He was quiet, listened more, and was even becoming more perceptive. His face, though still youngish, showed maturity in itself. It was the look he wore on his that showed serenity. This was most probably because Ranma could now sense most people and identify them for larger distances, thus becoming more confident in himself.<p>Upon reflection, Koryu considered the young man and his newly relaxed posture. Perhaps it was because he doesn't need to be on guard every second for a surprise attack anymore.<p>The Master Ninja smiled at this young man. Once Ranma had defeated his demons, he could be a good, loyal friend; one worth having. Maybe he could be Koryu's contact in the years to come. If he and Koryu had any business in this world for any reason, he'd come pay Ranma a visit. 'That would be fun...if possible' thought Koryu, smiling gently.<p>"Ranma." he waited for the young man to turn and look towards him. "I just wanted answer your question. Just like you are 'honor bound', so am I. I just prefer not to wave honor around like a flag, so I'd just rather say, I follow what I think is right. They give me orders, so as long as those orders aren't directly or indirectly hurting someone innocent...I'll follow them. There are of course times I don't do exactly what I'm supposed to but that's alright. I'm still under heat from the Shynko Disaster...heh."<p>"Shynko Disaster? That doesn't sound good." a feminine voice said.<p>"Hey, what do ya mean about wavin' honor like a flag-ow ow ow!" Ranma winced when Kasumi's hand found its way to Ranma's throbbing red ear again.<p>Koryu decided, after a moment to answer Kasumi's question first, not wanting to get into an argument with Ranma.<p>"Kasumi, I blew up a building. Let's just say it was one of the most advanced buildings in the world and the best thing was no one got hurt. Well, no one except me. Damn, I got blasted big time. That one decision of mine had me get into trouble that I couldn't get out of for a long time."<p>"H-how did you do that?" Kasumi asked, wide eyed.<p>"Heh, I know how you feel man. Building? I blew up an entire mountain." Ranma sympathized, his eyes shut as he nursed his ear.<p>"I am not sure that is something to be proud of Ranma," Kasumi said disapprovingly, flicking Ranma's nose. "Causing needless destruction is not what a martial artist should do."<p>Ranma winced, and not because of the flicking of his nose, though he decided to keep in mind that Kasumi could possibly attack that again when she's upset.<p>"I had no choice, Kasumi. It's not like I go around causing destruction just for the fun of it." Ranma argued. He was already upset at several things. He didn't need this guilt trip.<p>Kasumi glanced towards him, staring deeply into his eyes for a moment. She was satisfied to see guilt, shame and most of all regret register on his face; it also reflected in his eyes. She knew he didn't mean for those things to happen. She only wanted him not to boast about it as if it was a good thing.<p>Kasumi sent a quick frown to Koryu as well, hoping to her message across to him as well. "It's alright Ranma. I know. I just do not think this is something one should be proud about, that's all."<p>Ranma looked at her momentarily as she gave him her usual gentle smile. She patted him on the shoulder for additional support.<p>"Classified," Koryu winked.<p>"Mmm?" Kasumi twisted her eyebrows at Koryu.<p>"You asked how I did something like that. I can't tell you because that information is classified. Oh and by the way Ranma, I don't want to get into an argument with you, but I started thinking after meeting Mr. Tendo today. " Koryu said, quickly changing the subject.<p>"He spoke much of honor and so do you on occasion. With you I can understand, because you really feel those bounds when you speak of honor. Still, I believe that if honor is so sacred to you. You wouldn't speak about it so much. I mean would you take your most precious treasure and wave it around for everyone to see? I wouldn't. Hence, you won't see me talking about honor, unless the situation is very grave and I am with people who would really understand what I'm talking about." Koryu stopped for a breath of air.          "Sorry, Kasumi. I didn't want to insult your father or anything but he is a little deluded."<p>"It's okay, Koryu. I understand." Kasumi smiled and turned to look at Ranma, to whom the words had impacted the hardest.<p>Ranma had never thought about it, but it seemed so simple and so straight forward. But then again, he had hardly done any real thinking in his life. It just went to show how much he needed to change. He would, he would change. He would turn into a better person.<br/>Somehow, just being the greatest martial artist in the world was loosing its effect. He was so good, yet he was beginning to think that being the best in martial arts on its own did not seem to be cutting it. Why that was so, still eluded Ranma. Maybe he was beginning to understand that only worrying about the art on its own was not going to help him later on.       As an after thought, Ranma figured that just the fact that 'all for martial arts' being drilled into him by his father was reason enough to have doubt. But then again, after the talk with Kasumi in the morning, Ranma had begun to see her point of view. Even in history class, he had heard that many of the great martial artists also had excelled in other professions.<p>"Ranma, are you alright?" Kasumi asked, dragging Ranma out of his thought process.<p>"Hmm? Yea, I'm great Kasumi. Thanks for asking. I just couldn't help but agree with him." Ranma smiled confidently, yet there was a serious undertone in his voice and smile, which earned him a similar reply from his companions.<p>Kasumi put her arm around Ranma and snuggled in a bit, much to Ranma's embarrassment. "Ah, Kasumi?"<p>She winkled up her nose, "What, you going to let all those other girls snuggle up to you, but not me?" she whined cutely, teasing him.<p>With a sigh Ranma gave up, giving Koryu who was laughing, a growl. This was Ranma after all. He hated getting into situations where things could be misinterpreted. Still, he could easily sense anyone close by. Apart from the guards, there was no one around this area of the restaurant.<p>For a moment, Ranma still felt unstable, but a look at Kasumi melted his discomfort totally. He relaxed his entire body, leaned back slightly, and closed his eyes, and took in his environment.<p>Taking a moment to think, he realized that Kasumi was genuinely treating him like a friend. Nothing was made up. She would be happy, annoyed, and sweet in response to him, regardless to what he thought. Not just that, but Kasumi also needed a friend.<p>They were friends; real friends. With a smile, Ranma dared to wrap an arm around the girl's shoulder. It had a mind of its own resisted, obviously responding to its Pavlovian response to girls in close proximity, but Ranma heart won out in the end. He felt Kasumi shift slightly under his arm to be more comfortable.<p>The relaxation he found was similar to the feeling he had with Akane, only better.<p>After some amiable silence, Ranma felt content again. It didn't take long for the food to arrive.<p>They enjoyed the rest of the evening and talked about some of each other's experiences. Koryu seemed to find Ranma being hit on as a girl by the same guy who wants to kill his guy form so funny that he ended up falling of the couch laughing.<p>Both Ranma and Kasumi tried finding something on Koryu to make fun of, but they didn't know much about him in the first place. They doubted that whenever they landed on something, he would just end it with 'classified'.<p>"No girlfriend or someone special?" Kasumi smiled slyly.<p>"Nope. When I do get one, I promise you'll be the first to know."<p>"Hmm. You don't prefer men, do you?" She asked haltingly.<p>Koryu nearly choked, receiving a small chuckle from Ranma.<p>The young martial artists mimicked his friend perfectly, expertly crossing a leg over the other. He felt different, as if giving off air of competence and composure.<p>"Hey man, where do you get so much money from anyways? I used that money you gave me a few days ago, but I have no idea how to pay you back." Ranma said, suddenly remembering the question that had been keeping in his mind since yesterday.<p>Koryu crossed his arms, "Money? I don't really. Well, if I really need, I have enough to do whatever I want. When I travel, say for example through portals and stuff. I have included into the magic of the portal to carry a specific bag with me. In it, I have several items for me that might help me out. Now I can't really say what else was in the bag, but I can tell you I had several large diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. Now, after selling several small diamonds, I earned a few thousand dollars. That's quite a lot of money huh? When I leave, whatever money I have, I'll use it to buy another gem. I'm not rich or anything. I just have enough to get by with what I want or need."<p>"When will you leave anyways?" Kasumi interjected, her question being met with a prolonged silence.<p>"I don't know." Koryu let out a frustrated breath and messed up his hair, looking down at the ground, "I can't open any more portals because the swords that had cut me the night I arrived were laced with a specific poison. That poison is still going through my blood right now. It won't kill me, but it has sealed a serious amount of my abilities. The flow of energy in my blood stream is erratic. Probably a poison with some magical abilities." he explained.<p>Ranma frowned at the man, wondering why he didn't ask for some help, "You're a spy right? Why don't you get some help somewhere? Heck, maybe the Doc we know, Dr. Tofu can help you out."<p>Koryu laughed, "I am not so conceited to think I am the most powerful, Ranma. There may be, and most probably are people stronger than me out there. I do not want to cause unnecessary attention towards me, nor do I want to make trouble. Much could happen if I actively sought a cure for this poison. I'd need to meet knowledgeable people, who in turn could know others. I don't want to cause a ruckus. Any small action on my part could set off chains of reactions."<p>"Bullshit, what's the real reason?" Ranma asked. He knew that even he couldn't sense him when Koryu wanted to be unnoticed. He assumed someone like Koryu could easily trick almost anyone.<p>"That is a real reason, Ranma. But if you really want to know another one, I'll tell ya. If I try to look for a cure, it will require me to admit my ailment. That will lead to someone knowing my capabilities. The worse thing for a Ninja is for anyone to know of his/her abilities. No matter what, I cannot afford that - especially if someone decides to find another way to gain those same abilities. They could use it any way they want."<p>Kasumi nodded slightly in reply to his logic. He made sense. Being a spy, ninja or whatever he was. It was the art of secrecy, and it seemed Koryu took it very seriously. Even in the Tendo Ryu scrolls, it was stated to keep your techniques hidden. Should an opponent know them, then the effectiveness of the technique shall be reduced by half, or totally become ineffective, should the opponent be intelligent.<p>From what she had understood of Koryu's lifestyle, he lived in a dangerous world, metaphorically speaking. The people he worked with and the problems he dealt with had life, death, and conspiracy written all over them. His actions were understandable, but another problem arose.<p>"Then that means." She began<p>"I cannot go home for a while, probably. From where I opened the portal, my friends should be able to trace it and find me. It's a time and space thing, complicated and I can't be bothered to explain. Anyway, they should be able to come here and find me. We have already figured out a contingency for this type of situation. The only issue is the time, I have no idea how long it will take. It could be weeks, or even months. I'll have to wait and see. My ninja clan members and a few friends are the only ones who know about the portal and the specific way my powers, which have been sealed right now, can work."<p>"But what if your enemies come? What if they find out from your clan members?" Ranma interjected.<p>"They attacked me separately BECAUSE they didn't want to mess with my clan members. Each one's power level is almost equal to mine; I'd even go as far as saying they might be as strong as me. They're also extremely loyal, hence why Enwa Gumi singled me out." Koryu leaned forward to pick up his drink.<p>"Enwa Gumi?" Kasumi raised her brow.<p>"Er, bad guys? The idiots after me?" Koryu shrugged his shoulders.<p>"Why are they after you anyways?" Ranma asked, folding his arms, "Did you do something to them?"<p>"They want something I have. I cannot say what it is, but let us just say they were willing to kill my parents for it." Koryu's voice was soft, yet held controlled fury.<p>A look of horror crossed Kasumi's face while Ranma faced Koryu, dead serious, almost angry; he was clenching his fists tightly. "Shit... when was that?"<p>"I was seven years old. They were murdered in front of my eyes. I was forced to hide because of a promise, let's just forget this topic. I have gotten over it. It was tough; life can be a bitch. I lost my family once, but found a new one and right now I've strangely find two good friends, haven't I?" Koryu smiled.<p>"I-I'm so sorry, Koryu." Kasumi managed after a minute of silence.<p>As dumb as Ranma had acted in his life, there were times when his mind showed clarity. After recent events, the occurrence of those moments, specifically thanks to Kasumi and Koryu, were increasing.<p>This happened to be a time, when Ranma understood Koryu's feeling. He had made the connection quite well, the idea of living alone without a parent you loved, only trained in how to fight efficiently.<p>Ranma tried to subtly change the subject, "Hey..." he started softly, taking a bite off the chicken drumstick, "What is that drink you have there anyways? You told the waiter dude 'the usual' but...what is it?"<p>Koryu smiled evilly. "It's too strong for you man. Better leave it alone"<p>"Hey, I had traditional sake."<p>"That's only because I forced you to Ranma," Kasumi smiled after her initial shock at Ranma's mature action in changing the subject. He was growing up in leaps and bounds. She could have sworn he seemed in his twenties given the way he had behaved.<p>"Yea, but what he's having can't be much worse can it?" said martial artist asked.<p>"Lets just say it is made from different green material that is fed through a passage, then through a purification system, and finally through a processing system. The result goes through many different appendages and a by product of that is in accumulated in a central repository, from where it is sucked." Koryu explained carefully, waving his fork about.<p>Ranma tried to follow the explanation, having no idea what Koryu was going on about. Unlike before however, he had managed to hide his confusion quite well. A stoic expressionless face was what he let his companions view.<p>Kasumi giggled a bit after swallowing her mouthful. "Ranma, I believe Koryu's drinking milk."<p>"Milk?" Ranma's expressionless look fell like a ton of bricks.<p>Koryu snickered, "Told ya you couldn't handle it."<p>"Very funny."<p>The entire evening went along pleasantly, until the food was finished and no one really felt like desert except for Kasumi. She had asked for some chocolate pudding.<p>Ranma entered a discussion with Koryu on some of his techniques and their revisions to suit the momentum based fighting style. Kasumi started on her chocolate pudding while Ranma and Koryu went on to talk about their fight during the day.<p>'This tastes quite nice,' Kasumi thought, prodding her pudding after her first spoonful. It was not that strong, nor bitter. The sugar was just right as well. She thought she could make it better, however. Coming to this place was not a bad idea after all. It had given her some good ideas to make at home.<p>She figured Ranma would be happy, but then again he was not worried about what he ate as long as it tasted good.<p>"That mid-air twist was amazing. I've never thought of something like that before. It gives you a chance to hit the enemy again after the first initial attack almost instantly." Ranma commented, visualizing the whole scene that had taken place earlier that day.<p>Kasumi smiled at his enthusiasm at the feat. She almost regretted watching them fight. She had not been there the first time they fought. It would be interesting how they compare to each other.<p>"What was more impressive was your ability to get back to your feet. You fight by instinct, and not many people would have been able to recover from that bad landing." Koryu countered, "That had been one interesting two minute match."<p>Kasumi looked from one to the other with a politely bemused expression. "Is fighting all you boys will talk about?"<p>Koryu looked questioningly at the Tendo girl for a moment, "Yep. Guys have a tendency to be single minded in their conversations, while girls flitter about all over the place. Drive us guys crazy."<p>"Yeah." Ranma agreed, taking a moment to register the second comment Koryu had made.<p>"There is more to this world than fighting and martial arts." Kasumi gave Koryu a look which activated his self preservation instincts.<p>"Ranma, I believe its time we left. You need to start studying tonight, and I would at least like to get a general idea of where you are with respect to your subjects."<p>"I guess so...Yes, you're right. We could meet again tomorrow or something, is that alright Koryu?" Ranma cocked his head towards the other man.<p>"Rain check. You may not see me for a few days. I'll be busy trying to find a cure and resting." Koryu replied, causing Ranma to cross his arms in confusion.<p>"You said..."<p>"I know what I said, Ranma. What I didn't say was that I would go around some laboratories, and sneak in, trying to see if I can figure something out. I'm not going to ask anyone or go to anyone. It will be just a solo recon type thing." Koryu interjected.<p>"So when will we see you next?" Kasumi got up from her seat and started straightening her dress. Ranma got up with her.<p>"I have no idea. Nothing is set in stone with me. I guess I might drop by on occasion, but it could be a week or more."<p>"So today you were just coming to say bye?" Ranma furrowed his eyebrows.<p>"Cute. Ya got me. Well, I was just planning on saying bye for the time being. I suppose it turned out to be a good thing that Kasumi-chan dragged us here." Koryu shrugged off, earning a sweet smile from Kasumi and an amusing glance from Ranma.<p>"All right then, please take good care of your self Koryu, and come by to visit us soon." Kasumi smiled, turning to head for the door. Ranma hesitated for a moment to say something, before following Kasumi out the door.<p>"I'll see ya later then." He said, slowly taking his hand out to shake with Koryu, now knowing what else to do; he hadn't really been such well terms with another guy before. Maybe a simple wave would have been enough, like it was with anyone else.<p>'He isn't anyone else, though.' Ranma reminded himself.<p>Upon regarding the outstretched hand, Koryu allowed a lopsided grin to appear on his cool features, before offering his own in return.<p>"You will."<p>Just as they left the restaurant, Ranma and Kasumi continued walking down the street towards their home knowing it would still take at least half an hour to reach their destination. They had taken a taxi, on Koryu's expense, the way here.<p>"You want to take the cab back?" Ranma shifted his shoulders around slightly, glancing down at his companion from the corner of his eyes.<p>"Its nice weather, I suppose we can walk, unless you would like to get home quickly."<p>"Nah, I don't care-I mean, No, I don't mind walking," The pig tailed martial artist leaned slightly away from Kasumi. He didn't fancy having his ears ripped off, or elongated.<p>"Well, at least you are more language conscious now. Truth be told, I was getting weary of continuously disciplining you." Kasumi folded her arms and looked at the ground as she walked onwards.<p>"I don't really see the big deal about it, honestly."<p>"Ranma, one should know how to have a civilized conversation, because very few things are solved through fights in the world outside martial arts. No matter what you do, you will have to live in that world."<p>Ranma remained quiet for a moment, formulating his words carefully. "That just contradicts my entire life," he smiled bitterly.<p>"Not really. Martial arts beget martial art problems. Only one of your engagements is due to your skills. The others were due to your father or timing. Just because you haven't dealt with verbal conversation doesn't mean you can't. You learn everything else so quickly so why not try this? Look at Koryu, he talks slang more often than not, but he can carry an intellectual conversation easily," Kasumi giggled at the mental image of Ranma challenging a bystander to a duel, "What, use challenges to solve all the problems in your life?".<p>"I'm not Koryu though."<p>"Don't you want to be like him?"<p>"Err, No. He's him. I'm me. I'm...I dun- don't know how to say it but, we're different. I suppose we have similar traits and all, but we're like similar and different at the same time. So no, I don't want to be like him, because then I won't be me. Uhh, am I making sense?" Ranma screwed his eyebrows. God he sucked at conversation.<p>A familiar sense deja vu hit him. Last time he had that thought was when he was trying to make Kasumi understand the concepts of the Shadows of Honor.<p>Ranma didn't get an immediate reply to his statement, so he turned to look at Kasumi, wondering if he could read anything from her expression. He found her looking thoughtful for a moment before saying something softly.<p>"Oh my, " She muttered, "Strange isn't it? He said the same thing."<p>"Said what?" Ranma asked, intrigued.<p>"He said something about the two of you being similar, yet different, I don't remember exactly when he said it, but I distinctly remember him stating something to that effect."<p>"Hmm."<p>"You're both strange, aren't you? I never figured you to be the mysterious type Ranma." Kasumi giggled momentarily, smiling up at her companion.<p>"I'm not, well I never kept that many things to myself. I couldn't either, especially since Nabiki kept on digging around everything she could about me." Ranma clasped his hands behind his head.<p>"You even look more mature now. You move smoothly, confidently and are a lot more relaxed than you usually are." she commented.<p>"Two reasons for that: Firstly, it's because I'm with you and I feel totally comfortable with that. Secondly, I know that no one within twenty feet is trying to try a surprised attack or god knows what on me."<p>Kasumi's cheeks tinted faintly red and her heart started pounding a little harder against her chest as she unfolded her arms only to link her fingers behind her back. She leaned forward towards Ranma and smiled sweetly, "And why are you so comfortable with me?" she asked slyly.<p>Ranma genuinely smiled at her. He had already asked this question to himself earlier that day, ending up with a list of answers. To portray his point, he started counting on his fingers as he ticked off the reasons.<p>"Well, I can have a normal conversation with you without something going wrong. I can be in awkward situations with you and not have you bite my head off. I can pretty much talk to you about anything and know you'll understand it for what it is instead of trying to think the worst of me and jump to some wierd conclusions of your own. I mean, there's many reasons. You're really pretty as well, but then that isn't a real reason. I mean, you're like...you have a calming face, or aura that helps me keep my panic down." he explained,<p>"I mean, last but not least, you're hot. I mean you're beautiful, er. I mean you are hotter-er- more beautiful than any other woman I know. You look, um," Ranma glanced Kasumi up and down quickly taking in her elegant yet beautiful appearance while fighting a blush creeping on his face," and you look more mature and woman-like than anyone. Um, does that make sense?<p>"Thank you, Ranma. Yes, it makes sense. I understand what you mean to say." Kasumi beamed. She now knew why she was feeling slightly giddy. Much time had passed since when someone last complimented her openly about her personality or the points they appreciated about her. It felt good. It was said that opposites attract, and apparently it was true. Telling her she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever known had won him the prize though. It was quite an easy way to try and attract a girl, and it seems it was still effective, seeing as Kasumi felt her romantic side drawn towards Ranma.<p>Maybe 'attract' would be too forceful of a word, but ever since Ranma had opened up to her, they always seemed comfortable around each other. That thought pattern lead Kasumi to wonder why she was so comfortable around Ranma. Well that was obvious. She decided to voice her opinion.<p>"Well, Ranma, I suppose its only fair for me to explain my thoughts about you" Kasumi grinned at Ranma's slightly confused look," I find myself being extremely comfortable around you as well"<p>"Yeah, but you are comfortable with everyone." he shrugged.<p>"Ah, well, I suppose I am, but I no one I know is truly a bad person and I know they will not let any bad happen to me, but you're different."<p>"Different? How?" Ranma mused, giving another sideways glance at the elder girl.<p>"You understand me. You know almost as much about me as Nabiki does, only she's witnessed my behavior and you've heard about it from me. No one else understands. They take who I am, what I am for granted without trying to understand 'why' I am. You're not like that. While it's not something I would normally condone, I am willing to bet any amount of money that you can understand me better than anyone else can. You see me for who I am, not what I am."<p>They continued walking silently after her monologue, as Ranma gathered his thoughts. He knew she needed a friend. She felt lonely and needed him as a friend, but he didn't know how she felt when she was around him. Her feelings went far deeper than he initially believed.<p>"To be with someone who understands you. You and me," Ranma stopped and corrected himself, "You and I are in the same situation then aren't we? I guess we're as alike as me and Koryu."<p>"Koryu and I," Kasumi corrected softly, eliciting another grin. Ranma really was so innocent it was adorable, "I'm grateful that you are trying. You know it will take time."<p>"Ah, yes, Koryu and I." Ranma repeated, receiving a gentle index finger on his forehead, courtesy of Kasumi, to which he smiled. He remembered the last time she had done that.<p>"Well, I suppose we're something like best friends then huh? I mean, best friends are supposed to be like than and all, aren't they?"<p>"Well, I'm sorry Ranma, I haven't read a book which describes the relationship of best friends anywhere, but I guess, yes. I suppose we can consider ourselves as best friends...I see no harm in it."<p>"Well, we trust each other more than anyone else, right?" Ranma said.<p>"I know I do." Kasumi replied with a grin.<p>"Me too, so that finalizes it. Best friends?"<p>Kasumi offered her hand stoutly. Ranma took it.<p>"Best friends," they chorused, hand shaking as if they'd just signed an enormous business deal, erupting in laughter moments later.<p>"Man, we're still far away from home aren't we?" Kasumi commented a few minutes later.<p>"Want to get there fast? We can go home Saotome style," Ranma raised his fists in the air. Kasumi understood the insinuation, and shook her head slightly, blushing a bit.<p>The last time someone carried her like that was at Prince Toma's island. It had been really embarrassing, even if her 'carrier' turned out to be a sweet man. The thought of Ranma carrying her was not so bad, but then they would be home too quickly. She was rather enjoying this walk.<p>"I'm quite enjoying this walk, so it's alright."<p>Ranma shrugged in response, knowing he felt the same way.<p>"So..." he started, placing his hands behind his head, thinking of a conversation to start, "You're not gonna do my homework for-" he faltered, wondering why Kasumi was giving him the 'sly glare' as he decided to call it, "huh? OH...I mean, you're not going to do my homework for me, are you?" he pronounced every word carefully.<p>Kasumi's 'sly glare' dissolved into a sly wink as she walked closer to him to nudge him in the ribs, "You're learning faster now. Maybe I won't have to pull your ears off after all."<p>"I like my ears where they are, thank you" he replied,"So?"<p>"Ranma, I will help you do your homework, and I need to know where you stand in your subjects. If, IF you want to be good in the world of people, you need to know all the basics. I suppose the best for you, and your martial arts background, you should learn history. You need to know what has happened in the world. I would also suggest you study extra hard at math and the other sciences.<p>"Ugh, math."<p>"Ranma, lets just consider it training, as we talked about today morning. When you start off, obviously it will be difficult. You'll get better the more time you spend at it. It's the same as any move you study off a scroll," The Tendo girl explained.<p>"Speaking of scrolls, where did you get the Tendo Ryu scrolls from?" Ranma asked.<p>"Please don't change the subject, Ranma." Kasumi cocked an eyebrow.<p>"Hmm? No, I wasn't changing anything, I just wanted to know where you got the Tendo Scrolls. Does Akane know about them, does she use them?"<p>"Mmm, well, she doesn't have some the advanced scrolls, since I keep them, but she does have access to the other scrolls that are locked up in the Dojo. Since father has stopped training Akane, she needs to complete her understanding on her control before she can go onwards. So I read the scrolls from time to time."<p>Now that Ranma had the knowledge, he didn't know what to do with it. He hadn't seen Akane ever look into the scrolls before when even Ranma had to to do so from time to time, to revise and check up some techniques. That train of thought faded from Ranma's mind as he felt a faint sneaky presence on the opposite side of the street.<p>'Sasuke' Ranma thought irately, 'I swear, if anything happens to Kasumi because of his snooping around...'<p>"It would be funny if someone we know spotted us and jumped to conclusions again." Ranma commented offhandedly, carefully mouthing 'Sasuke' and tilting his head to the side.<p>"Why would that be?" Kasumi didn't turn, nor make any sudden movement, but understood Ranma's concern. They were being watched.<p>"Yeah, I mean, we just came back from dinner with a friend of ours, but no one would think that would they? They would be easily imagining the worst, that we're romantically involved or some spew like that. Of course that would set off the fiancée brigade up against you." Ranma continued slightly louder than before, making sure Sasuke heard.<p>"What would you do, if that happened? Oh my, I can't even think of that possibility." Kasumi smiled.<p>"Someone might want to hurt you. Che, though there's nothing to worry about, Kasumi. If things start going that way, I will not let anything happen to you. I would feel sorry for the person who started the rumor, though.<p>"Why's that?"<p>"Because I'd find out who it is. What I did to Saffron will be squat compared to what I'll do to that person for endangering an innocent." Ranma said seriously, his battle aura had already started forming around him, hugging his entire body, letting off wisps to the air around him.<p>Ranma, not wanting to let too much aura off, started to control and swerve it around himself; it was something he had learned recently when trying to control his distress or anger. It was not the Soul of Ice, where the aura is held back. Instead of holding it back, it was released; only Ranma controlled where it went, and how it was let off.<p>The result was an astounding display as his fiery blue, burning aura swirled around him, flowing around his entire body, causing his hair to sway and his pigtail to levitate, flickering with the aura itself.<p>"Ranma? Are you alright?" Kasumi asked, slightly worried.<p>"Nope, I'm not. Nothing is worse than endangering an innocent. If by someone's actions, you got hurt, I will not have mercy on the person who was the cause of it." Ranma was dead serious. He had stopped walking and looked straight at the horizon, or what he could see of it from the street. His aura was flowing smoothly around him, his eyes were narrow and stone cold, uncaring to the environment around him.<p>Usually, Ranma let his ki disperse into the air when he let his battle aura off. Since this time he was controlling most of it, it only began to accumulate, becoming dense, causing Kasumi to feel the push of the aura against her. She stepped away in response. The ground below him and the wall opposite him started cracking as dust started flowing with his aura's swirling motion.<p>Unknown to him, the entire street had cleared leaving the two standing there.<p>He had initially wanted to warn off Sasuke, but when he thought about Kasumi actually getting involved or injured, something burst inside of him, setting off a stampede of rage. Little by little, the locks keeping his emotions in were being broken, each lock letting more of his anger seep through. It was only when he felt someone grab hold to his hand tightly, did he turn to look and find Kasumi's face streaked with concern.<p>It wouldn't do, it just didn't feel right to have that look on Kasumi's face, especially when it was caused by him. Slowly, bit by bit, Ranma gathered his thoughts, putting a lid on his emotions, knowing how things went on in Nerima. So far, not one innocent had gotten badly injured. It should be all right.<p>Besides, if something went wrong, he would be there, and if he had any indication on Koryu's character, Ranma knew that Koryu, while here, wouldn't let anything happen either.<p>Regardless, the uneasy feeling did not leave the back of his mind.<p>Slowly, but definitely, Ranma's battle aura dissipated into thin air and he regained his calm outlook. It quickly became slightly apologetic since he had worried his new found 'best friend'.<p>"Sorry, I guess I got a bit carried away there," Ranma glanced towards the area where Sasuke had been. "Well, the good thing is that I probably got my message across. Sasuke isn't there anymore." Ranma apologized.<p>Kasumi looked over Ranma for a few moments before concluding that everything was alright. she didn't let go of his arm as she slowly started moving towards home, gently dragging him along. "I suppose so. What made you almost lose your control?"<p>"The thought of you getting hurt" Ranma murmured, letting off a sigh as he let Kasumi guide him. Somehow he felt relieved that she was dragging him. He had been dragged before, but he had never felt calm while being dragged. He snorted at the thought of him being dragged when had been knocked unconscious or such.<p>By the sourness he had felt in the back of the head, Ranma had felt he had been dragged by his pig tail as well. Banishing his melancholy thoughts, Ranma concentrated on the person dragging him off. She was leaning forward, as if she was dragging something heavy.<p>Little did he know that she was blushing like crazy, tilting her head in embarrassment. She had been half expecting that reply, but she was totally unprepared for the consequential emotions that had responded to it. She knew why she was feeling that way. It was quite simple really.<p>There was a first time for everything. What Ranma had said was really sweet; no one had ever really showed such concern for her before. Such protective emotion directed towards her personally warmed her heart. Only problem was that the heat had spread throughout her body and she could clearly feel it on her face.<p>"Kasumi, it's alright, you don't have to drag me." the young martial artist spoke, quickening the pace to catch up to Kasumi, "Kasumi, what's wrong? Aww, you're not crying are you? Look, I hate it when girls cry."<p>The girl in question quickly shook her head, "No Ranma, its nothing like that, it's just. I just felt nice when you said that. It feels good when someone is protective like that."<p>"Huh? But people are always protective about you. Akane was this afternoon. You're father goes into a 'tantrum of the century' mode if you even get a scratch." Ranma countered, to which Kasumi sighed, and started giggling.<p>"Oh Ranma, its not like that. You really are innocent aren't you? I meant that a guy is so protective of me. It's what a girl always wants...well, it's what most typical girls always want." Kasumi corrected, thinking of a younger sibling, "You know, like you are always protecting Akane. I've never really had anyone do or say something like that before."<p>"So what? You want to get into trouble so I can protect you?" Ranma smirked.<p>"Not that, silly, Oh never mind." Kasumi rolled her eyes uncharacteristically.<p>"I'll always be protective of you, especially after what happened, you know, a few days ago. Not just because you're innocent...I mean, you're my best friend right? Heck, Ukyo's supposed to be my best friend and you're...I dunno, you're different from her. You're ...umm...a lot closer...I guess." Ranma mumbled.<p>Kasumi smiled at him, finally getting her tinted cheeks under control, though she dared a little and put her arm in his comfortably as they continued walking.<p>Ranma, yet again felt like resisting, but his body seemed to understand a simple fact; Kasumi was allowed to be close to him and didn't want his body or genes like anyone else. He let her slip her arm in his, enjoying the smell of her perfume, whatever she was wearing.<p>On their way, the two passed an overhead street light, totally oblivious to anything apart from themselves as they amiably made their way towards the Tendo home, content in each other's company.<p>On top of that specific streetlight, a lone figure sat cross legged, its head resting on its palm, having the elbow resting on its knee.<p>"So...Little red riding hood takes the big bad wolf back home, not a typical story huh?" the man muttered to himself quietly, scratching the back of his head. 'Man, I really wished I could spend more time with them. I enjoy it. I finally get a vacation type situation and lo! behold, I have to go find a fuckin' cure for the bitchin' poison runnin' through my veins.' Koryu thought bitterly.<p>Having lived most of his life either keeping distance from the Enwa Gumi, or working with the Shadow Squad to make sure technology is used how its supposed to be without making potential disaster for innocents, he had had little or no free time to participate in other activities. Hence, he never really knew what he liked.<p>He liked a friendly spar, but he had realized that he had also just enjoyed the evening spending time with two people he had begun to consider his friends. Especially Ranma. In Koryu's opinion, that young man defined loyalty.<p>Spending time with either Ranma or Kasumi, preferably both, brought about a good time, and it felt refreshing.<p>'Oh well, the quicker I trace an antidote, if possible, the quicker I can recover. Once I manage to unseal the spirits, I'll easily be able to spend more time with them for a while before going back home. Heck, I won't be worried about Ranma kicking my ass either. If we had continued our spar today, that punk would have forced me to draw my sword. Only three people in my entire life have ever managed to do that.' Koryu thought deeply, wondering just how powerful Ranma could be when he modified his own style to encompass momentum based fighting.<p>One thing was certain; Ranma was a genius, and his adaptability rivaled that of Koryu's himself. What shocked Koryu most of all was the amount of aura that young man could generate.<p>Koryu, being a Ninja, generated a large aura himself, but hid it, and used it to perform magical techniques or support his strength internally through his veins or muscle.<p>Ranma on the other hand used mainly ki based techniques. His ki strength was daunting. His reflexes, fighting ability and instincts seemed to be on overdrive. Being able to use all those in sync while letting off ki, where Koryu kept it in, it was not difficult to believe that this man had destroyed a mountain. Koryu thought Ranma could so much more.<p>Koryu thought about it for a moment, carefully comparing himself against Ranma. Ranma let off ki, and Koryu kept it in. Yet they achieved similar results, only Ranma had reserves of ki Koryu probably could never reach even with a strength enhancing technique. He couldn't help but smile at Ranma's comment about the two.<p>Different but similar. How true.<p>Koryu shivered, it was a good thing he had convinced Ranma not to attack the night he had arrived. He wouldn't have lasted five minutes against the Saotome heir. Ranma had produced a dangerously powerful aura moments ago. Usually aura that is let off, disperses.<p>The Saotome heir had kept it close to his body and let it build up density and strength. It was like compressing air to use it in gas cylinders. When they explode, they could cause serious damage. Ranma was finally learning to actively control his aura.<p>He was finally showing his true potential. No one in their right mind would wan't to fight Ranma if he managed to incorporate this ability of his, which he seemed to have learned quite easily, into his moves.<br/>He'd be on a new level if he started developing new techniques.<p>'Maybe I'll learn his fighting style too,' He pondered as he leaned back from his position, watching Ranma and Kasumi as they were almost out of sight, 'It's damn effective.'<p>His balance faltered backwards; Koryu momentarily glanced dangerously at the bush Sasuke had been using across the street to spy. He wondered in that instant, whether to cross paths with the young ninja and give him a slight demonstration in the reality of his kind, but decided against it. It was of no consequence.<p>Ranma would deal with his problems, his way. Koryu had no reason to get involved, and wouldn't unless dire need arose. That was how he had always worked, and it wasn't going to change.<p>Gravity finally pulled his weight off the street light, making Koryu fall, his back facing the ground. Moments before striking the ground, his body dispersed into mist and a dense cloud struck the ground and dissolved into the air.<p>The following night for Ranma had turned out to be a surprise, because he had to find out the hard way, just how tough a task master Kasumi was. They had arrived home at 7:30 PM and Kasumi had him working till midnight.<p>The first thing Ranma and Kasumi did as soon as they reached home was to explain their evening to Mr. Tendo, who was threatening to flood the entire house with his forth coming tears.<p>Kasumi put on her always present smile at her father, "We had a good time father."<p>"You did, did you? Ah, I could see he was a man of great promise. Maybe we could hold a double wedding." Soun started shedding alligator tears, which soon turned into a pair of waterfalls.<p>"Oh my! Father, don't you think it's a little too soon to think like that? He's a good friend. Saying such things would not be appropriate, don't you think?" Kasumi put her hand in front of her mouth.<p>"I just want what's best for my children, and this Koryu looks to be like a perfect man for you. He raised your interest in the art as well. Any man who can do that is a dutiful man in my book." Kasumi's father explained, "Will he be coming tomorrow?"<p>"Sorry, father. He said some business had come up and he would be busy for a week or two. He promised to come by after that though."<p>"Hmm. That is a little disappointing that we won't be seeing him soon, but a man keeps to his responsibilities." Soun said, crossing his arms confidently.<p>'And that makes you what?' thought Ranma, slowly making his way upstairs, careful to avoid Nabiki's look as she climbed down to greet them.<p>"How was the dinner Ranma?" Nabiki asked, keeping the envious feeling she had out of her voice. She always wanted to go to that restaurant. It was supposed to have excellent food and wine.<p>"The same as any other restaurant." Ranma commented offhandedly, passing her by.<p>"Same as any other restaurant?" Nabiki asked, slightly wide eyed, "Oh yes, I forgot. You wouldn't know how to differentiate would you?" she voiced dryly.<p>"Whatever, Nabiki. I gotta go do my homework." The Saotome offspring entered Kasumi's room and disappeared behind the door as it creaked to close.<p>Nabiki smiled enigmatically, walking down to greet her elder sister. She found Kasumi in her in the kitchen, checking over all the utensils and washing the dishes left over from dinner.<p>"So how was dinner with wonder boy? Golden Dragon huh? Must have been nice...ah Kasumi, shouldn't you change your clothes before you work in the kitchen. I don't want anything getting on my dress."<p>Kasumi waved of Nabiki's concern with her hand, "Oh don't worry, I don't believe I will let anything mar this beautiful dress. I am wearing an apron."<p>"Still..."<p>"The dinner was great. We really enjoyed ourselves. The food was very good, but I couldn't help but feel that it was lacking some taste...oh and the sake was very good as well. I don't remember what kind it was. I was just served, and I didn't think it polite to ask any questions."<p>Nabiki sighed, "You never do- wha? Wait, sake?" Nabiki blinked, "Kasumi, what's happening? First Ranma's behavior, then he obliterates Kuno, then you go out with Tofu and now you're drinking sake with this guy?"<p>Kasumi facial expression didn't change as she continued washing the dishes with a homely air, "I see you went with Akane to visit Dr. Tofu." she commented, drying the plate she had in her hand, placing it aside then proceeded to collect the next one to wash.<p>"Well, I wasn't planning on prying, but too many things are going on...and they are totally different than the normal." Nabiki watched with slight surprise as Kasumi giggled a bit.<p>"Nabiki, since when have are lives ever been 'normal'." Kasumi grinned, causing Nabiki to question if her elder sister was still under the effects of alcohol.<p>"Maybe." Kasumi said, retrieving another dish. "I suppose so; I don't distinctly remember how many glasses I had." Kasumi commented ever so sweetly.<p>Nabiki groaned, "Wow, you have me stumped. Even I wasn't expecting this. Well, no one's perfect, but you know Kasumi...you know very well I hate being left out in the dark. It helps keep things going when I know what's happening. Now what did you tell this Koryu about me? I could swear I saw mischievousness in his eyes when we had our brief introduction."<p>Kasumi finished drying the last dish, placing it in its place on the shelf and proceeded to take off her apron, "I just said you were an intelligent girl, who was very good at reading people. I suppose I did mention about your hobbies with bets and the knack of making quick money out of situations." she continued as she untied the strings behind her back.<p>"Kasumi? Why did you tell him? I can tell he's intelligent. I don't want anyone causing problems for me."<p>"Oh, he won't be a problem Nabiki. But I think you may find it difficulty in extorting money out of him though." Kasumi giggled again. Yes, that would be amusing to watch.<p>Kasumi, don't you think you're going a bit far here? I mean, things are moving too fast, too quickly," Nabiki crossed her arms, took a breath and continued, "if you get what I mean."<p>The smile on the elder Tendo daughter faltered a bit, before coming back in full force, but it wasn't the same smile she had a moment ago. "I suppose I shouldn't be behaving like this. I just thought that maybe I could change a few things around the house. Ranma was depressed after the failed wedding, and I am helping him cope...hopefully Akane will see the change in him soon. It's just that, well I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Please don't get me wrong; I love taking care of my family. You all mean much more to me than anything in the world. I just want to help outside the household chores, and maybe I can. I started with Ranma. He is the source of most problems, isn't he?" Kasumi explained sadly.<p>The Nabiki's face lost its composure as she bought an apologetic look, "Kasumi, I have no problem with you having fun and I would bet a million yen no one in the house would either...but don't you think getting involved with Ranma is a little dangerous? Especially with those 'signifant others' who love to destroy first, and ask questions later." she said so quietly, she was almost whispering.<p>Contrary to what the Ice Queen was expecting, her elder sibling cheered up almost instantly, a genuine girly smile lit up her face as she looked at Nabiki as though nothing was wrong in the world.<p>"Oh my, no, no I don't think it's dangerous at all. I am helping tutor Ranma, and give him a little sisterly love he never had. Besides, I just know he would never let anything happen to me." Said Kasumi a little too cheerfully for Nabiki's taste, to which the younger girl raised an eyebrow.<p>'Hmmm. Interesting. Dangerous, but interesting...' Nabiki thought, a small smile coming to her face, "And how do you know that?" she implored.<p>"I just do." Kasumi winked at Nabiki before placing the folded apron aside and walking through the door.<p>'Definitely interesting. I guess a little match between sisters on brains would be a good addition to the list of the Para Para-norms that have been taking place lately.' Nabiki smiled almost evilly.<p>It was only fair that she find out about Koryu, since he knew about her. She wasn't stupid. She knew what she was getting into. It would still be interesting to see. Regardless, Nabiki also knew that they had not openly taken any action. Maybe it was just the wacky part of the whole deal, but then again, only property damage had taken place because of the martial artists in Nerima, even if the damage was quite devastating at times.<p>Maybe they were just watching...for what Nabiki didn't know, but maybe she could find out. A thought suddenly rang bells in Nabiki's head.<p>Maybe Koryu had been sent by the government to watch over what's happening in the city.<p>It would seem plausible after the whole Jusendo incident. Maybe Koryu had been here before, and knew Kasumi, that's why he was sent here in the first place. The entourage of these new thoughts only flamed Nabiki's determination to find out as much as she could about this new character that had suddenly dropped into their lives.<p>Upstairs in Kasumi's room, Ranma sat quietly with his mind stuck on trying to figure out Akane's attitude. He had decided to pay her a visit and see how she was doing. He knew she had hurt herself badly in her fight against Koryu.<p>Unfortunately Akane had all but avoided Ranma, and didn't even bother opening the door when he knocked. "I'm not in a mood to talk, Ranma" she had said, making him wonder if he had done something to upset her again. When he said he just wanted to see if she was ok, she had opened up the door momentarily to let him see her, then she promptly closed in his face after saying, "There, see, I'm alright. Just a little sour."<p>She certainly hadn't seemed angry, just more thoughtful and surprisingly cute. Her attitude didn't make him feel any better though. Why was she behaving as if she didn't care about what he thought?<p>Maybe things would work out after all?<p>Ranma had thought that for a moment, but remembered her behavior earlier that day. Not that be blamed her, but her high-strung attitude has becoming more and more frustrating for the Saotome offspring.<p>Kasumi had hinted in the morning that in some ways, he was the cause of her attitude sometimes, due to her insecurity and pride. For the life of him, Ranma just couldn't think of how he would be causing her stress right now. He had done nothing.<p>Maybe that was why she was mad? But then if he had done something, she would have been mad at him anyways.<p>Ranma snickered. Something he had never done when thinking about Akane before. He still felt however, that whether he did something or not, she would always have it in for him.<p>After shrugging in despair, Ranma had quickly opened up his bag to take out his books just as the door opened to let Kasumi walk in.<p>"Oh my, you haven't even opened your books yet? Ranma, I thought that at least you would have started on today's homework," she chided.<p>"Sorry, I had some stuff on my mind..."<p>"I see...would you like to talk about it?"<p>Ranma looked up at Kasumi thoughtfully, and then proceeded to explain what had happened a few moments ago. Kasumi sat down on the bed, eyeing him intently as he explicated.<p>"Maybe I should have a talk with her..." Kasumi wondered out loud, "I'll do it tomorrow when she comes back from school. She should have calmed down by then and would be able to think more clearly. Though maybe I should check up on how she's doing. I guess I'll do that right after I change my clothes."<p>"She wasn't angry, well she didn't look it." Ranma commented, "she looked normal, I guess, stable or thoughtful, if that's ever possible."<p>"Thoughtful? That's good!" Kasumi beamed, "Maybe she's starting to reflect on what happened today...it would be nice to have her rationalize more often."<p>"Whatever," Ranma sighed, opening his books. "Ugh, I hate math." he complained.<p>"Just start and I will be back shortly, Kasumi said, picking up her usual house dress from the cupboard and walked out the door, leaving Ranma with dread.<p>After she quickly changed into her usual housedress and gave the evening dress back to Nabiki with an extra thanks, Kasumi went over to and politely knocked on Akane's door.<p>"Who is it?" came a muffled voice.<p>"Akane, it's me Kasumi. I just wanted to see how you were doing."<p>There was silence for few moments.<p>"Come in, the door's open."<p>Kasumi hesitantly opened the door, and peeked in. "I hope I am not disturbing you."<p>"No it's alright," Akane was sitting at her desk. Kasumi immediately identified the bandages that were on her hand and leg.<p>"Oh, I hope your injuries weren't too bad. I wanted to stop the fight, but you continued going on and…"<p>"Kasumi-nee, it's alright. He was a strong fighter. Dr. Tofu says that it will take at least a week for my sprain to heal. It might take even longer, because I'm supposed to rest them completely, and I still have to go to school and all."<p>Akane watched expectantly as her elder sister's facial features slowly changed from serene to polite concern.<p>"Maybe you should stay at home. Ranma can bring you any homework from your teachers. Perhaps not the whole week, but you should at least try and stay home for a day or two."<p>Akane looked thoughtful for a moment, "Hmm, maybe I should...I don't know how I would deal with the hentai squad in the morning...Ranma didn't help fight them today, and they seemed to think because of it they still had a chance with me."<p>"...About them..." Kasumi began haltedly, leaning forward and intertwining her fingers behind her, "Maybe you should change your approach."<p>Akane furrowed her eyebrows, "What do you mean?"<p>Kasumi smiled gently and sat down on Akane's bed, placing her hands on her lap. "Akane," she soothed gently, "Why don't you trick them in their own game? I recall trying to tell you this few hears back, but you seemed so adamant about fighting through it; I didn't want to press you any further. Then Ranma came, and you seemed to be getting better."<p>Akane looked a little downcast from the mention of the pig tailed martial artist.<p>"Since this problem has started again," Kasumi continued, "Why not state officially that, the person who can defeat Kuno in a battle shall be allowed to consider being your friend. I highly doubt that is possible...and at the same time, I believe it will get Kuno back for what trouble he has caused you. Don't you think?"<p>The youngest Tendo daughter stared at her elder sister, wide eyed. She remembered Kasumi trying to help her out some while back, trying to convince her to handle the matters without her actually getting involved in any fight.<p>Akane had simply turned that down, quite angrily, in fact. She had been very annoyed at the 'hentai squad', and firmly believed that they deserved punishment.<p>Even now she thought they deserved some hell for the problems they caused her every morning. But in the end, they were all immature brats. They needed to grow up.<p>"This, this is a really good idea sis!" Akane exclaimed. Kuno would finally get a taste of his on medicine! "But...but..."<p>"What is it, Akane?"<p>"I-it's so unlike you, to do suggest something like this."<p>Kasumi sighed, "Akane, I dislike causing other people discomfort and always search for the inner beauty everyone has," she was hoping she would get her younger sibling to understand her point of view.<p>"I know you are a very strong girl. You have handled so much pressure recently, and still come out on top. Perhaps it was a little arrogant of me, but I never thought anyone could take down my little sister so easily. You really are the pride of this family, and you have proven my instincts correct," Kasumi moved forward to envelop her sibling in a warm embrace, "Having said that, I think everyone deserves a break. You will be in your senior year soon, and will have to make some important decisions. I don't want you to handle these pressures along with the new ones you will soon burden."<p>"Onee-chan," Akane whispered, not knowing what else to say. She was speechless.<p>"It's alright, Akane, I will always be here for you. There are always different approaches to our problems. I suggest you try this one. It would be quite easy to set up, don't you think? We do have Nabiki as our sister, after all" Kasumi moved back and smiled, earning a lop sided grin from Akane in reply. The grin wasn't long lasting, soon turning into a small frown.<p>"But sis. What about Kuno?"<p>"Oh, that should not be difficult. Just state that he has to beat Ranma. Ranma has gone so far for you, and still does." Kasumi stopped for a moment to think a little deeper on the matter.<p>"In fact, I would think you should state, that Kuno would be allowed to fight you in a one-on-one match. That will let you practice your skills in the art and should he beat you, he will be allowed to challenge Ranma. Should be beat Ranma, he would then be allowed to talk to you. If he is as noble as he states, he will abide by your rules. I might not like it, but maybe it is time for Kuno-chan to start tasting his own blend of medicine." Kasumi smiled.<p>"Talk to me? But wouldn't that mean-"<p>"We'll burn that bridge when...or rather if we come to it."<p>"That's...that's an amazing idea! Its surprising how Nabiki didn't think of it!" Akane exclaimed.<p>"Well...you probably never asked. I am sure she will be happy though. She can really make more money with those betting pools of hers."<p>Akane frowned," So her betting pools are more precious than me?"<p>Kasumi gave a little giggle, causing Akane to regard her eldest sister in slight puzzlement.<p>"Akane, perhaps Nabiki might have the same arrogance I have in regards to your resilience...And you never asked her for help...did you?"<p>Akane sheepishly looked down at the ground, "Well no, but then I didn't need any help-"<p>"Akane, martial arts isn't all about fighting. It is also about knowing your current situation, and finding the best way out of it." The elder Tendo sister spoke softly and slowly, not looking away from her sibling's eyes in hopes of keeping the younger girl from taking offence to that remark.<p>"But…" Akane's outburst didn't live long.<p>"Akane, trust me, its alright." Kasumi soothed, "You don't have to say anything else, just trust me. You can do that can't you? Would I ever willingly or purposefully direct you in harm's way?"<p>Akane deflated slightly, only to look at Kasumi confusingly, "No,you wouldn't. But Sis, you've been acting quite strange lately."<p>Kasumi beamed, "How so?", she moved back to the bed, sitting down. She knew she'd have this talk with her sooner or later, and right now her dear sister seemed to be thinking quite rationally.<p>"I mean, with that guy today, Koryu, its so like you to not say anything to someone if they behaved like that, but you were even asking me to stop." Akane explained. She did expect some sort of resistance from Kasumi that afternoon, obviously because her eldest sister was so kind.<p>Akane hadn't expected the forcefulness of her request. She even went out with him for the rest of the evening. "Also, he behaved like that and you didn't mind, and you even went out with Dr Tofu. I mean isn't that like...two timing him?" Akane asked slightly meekly, looking away. She didn't know if she should be delving into her sister's personal life, but it would sure help give her some answers.<p>She saw Kasumi smile again from the corner of her eye, letting go of breath she had held in a moment ago. "Akane, let me try and answer your question with a question of my own. Tell me, do you like Ryoga?"<p>Akane's widened at the mention of the boy's name." Um, yeah. He's a really good friend, and very reliable." She just wished Ranma would treat her like he did.<p>"Koryu is the same to me, as Ryoga is to you. But he seems to be having some brotherly qualities." Kasumi tilted her head to the side in wonder, having a slight twinkle in her eye. "Not that I have any experience in this. I've never had a brother, but I kind of feel that whenever I'm with him. He's always making fun, and teasing me here and there, but he's careful with me. At times I can also get away with teasing him. Like today, he didn't really invite us out, but he willingly obliged when I said so. He even took us to the Golden Dragon, which is a very expensive restaurant."<p>"Teased? You can tease?" Akane's eyes only got wider. Her sister never teased someone.<p>Kasumi's carefree happy air turned the other way as her eyes gathered wisps of sadness into them, as she looked out the window, not having the stomach to look at Akane anymore.<p>"Is that wrong? It's not something I would do, but its enjoyable, getting teased or teasing someone. I feel a little more alive. I hope that's not asking too much." Kasumi stated feebly. She was a little apprehensive on her family's reaction to her little more capricious behavior.<p>Apparently it showed on her face, making Akane go through a ride the guilt train. "No, no, it's not wrong at all. It was just a little surprising, that's all. You usually do not behave like that so I was just wondering if everything was alright. You know with all the magic and potions that take place here, I was hoping no one did anything to you. If they did, I mean it would all be Ranma's fault." Akane quickly explained, ending her last sentence with a slightly annoyed, yet understanding tone.<p>Kasumi stared at Akane quietly, her sadness slowly transfiguring it self into frustration. Why must she always end up blaming Ranma for most that happened? This was part of the reason why Ranma had been in such a destructive state several days ago. "Why would that be Ranma's fault?" Kasumi asked. Perhaps if she understood Akane's thinking process, she would help make amends.<p>Akane blinked, "Well, its always his fault isn't it?" speaking as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.<p>Kasumi bit her lower lip to hold in a sigh. She had been hoping for a better reason. She thought for a moment before making a reply.<p>"How so?" she asked.<p>"Well, it's easy. If you had been drugged or something, it would have been done because of the other bimbos. If he had gotten rid of them once in for all, crazy stuff like this wouldn't happen would it?" Akane explained.<p>"Akane, have you thought about what would happen if Ranma did take a serious stand without thinking carefully? Have you thought about what would happen to his honor if he did? Ukyo-chan, Shampoo-chan both has an impact on Ranma's honor. Kodachi-chan...Well...As far as I can imagine Ranma doesn't want to make an enemy of her, precisely for the same reason that he doesn't want to cause her to retaliate more than she already does. What do you think about Ranma living all of his life, being put in such embarrassing circumstances? The only thing that remained with him was his honor. Now you want him to just through it all away?"<p>"But is honor more important than family?" Akane blurted out, then blushed a bit, realizing what she implied.<p>"Are you certain that the other fiancées would do absolutely nothing, if he totally eradicated all contact with them? How do you think that the others will respond. Given their recent actions, I would have to say, if anything, they will be violent. Do you not think that Ranma doesn't want the same thing to happen to our home that happened to his?" Kasumi continued on,hoping to bring some sense into Akane. She was so sweet, but needed to understand that the world didn't travel in the direction she thought it did.<p>The person in question was staring at her elder in slight shock, "I-I never...never though it like that. Do you think that's the cause of his behavior lately?" Akane gasped, the sudden realization putting cobwebs in her stomach.<p>"Akane, Ranma is hurting too. Probably much more than any of you because he understands your pain and until now he has sacrificed almost everything he had to relieve you of it. He just kept his honor. Unfortunately, that's the one thing that is causing more friction. You really need to trust him more. Why do you think he has been so dull on so many occasions lately? Part of him is so tired of it all, and part of him doesn't want anymore fights that could involve someone else."<p>Akane didn't stop staring at her elder sister. She was surprised how Kasumi could say so much about Ranma, evidently taking his side, yet being reasonably rational, which led her to her next question.<p>"How do you know all this? Has the baka talked to you?" Akane had started off slowly, but got angry at her second question. Why hadn't he told her about it? After going through so much he still couldn't tell her!<p>"Akane, he didn't tell me anything about these reasons for his behavior."<p>"Then how?"<p>Kasumi smiled again, one of those knowing smiles, "Dear Akane, at times, a person's thoughts can easily be understood by his or her actions. It does require insight, I suppose and I have been studying a lot of psychology. By putting that together and what I have seen and heard of Ranma, I came to this conclusion."<p>"Then why won't he talk to anybody?"<p>Kasumi chose that moment to gracefully get up and walk to the door. "I do not want to answer your question with another, Akane, but... Who would listen? Would it make a difference for him?"<p>Akane felt slightly offended. "Of course! I listen and I…"<p>"But you usually blame him before listening his side of the story, like you did just now, and he's noticeably worn-out of getting into arguments with you. I could be wrong Akane. While I do not deny that, I think Ranma has a little more depth than you give him credit for."<p>With that said, Kasumi bid Akane goodnight and walked out, closing the door behind her, leaving Akane with a myriad of confusing thoughts.<p>It was not impossible for Ranma to think like that, Akane told herself, but it was also highly unlikely. Why was Kasumi taking his side so much. Maybe she was helping? She was, wasn't she? She was trying to help her understand Ranma better. She also seemed to want Akane to concentrate on her life more. Unlike her father, Kasumi looked like she wanted Akane to move onwards in life.<p>Akane gasped. Was it because she couldn't? Kasumi couldn't go forward in life, and she didn't want Akane to be left behind without a future like she did? Akane wanted to go to university, and at times she wondered about a career. She wasn't so sure about teaching in the dojo. It was a great place to practice and let off some steam, but she simply couldn't imagine herself as an instructor.<p>That was something her father wanted, or maybe he wanted Ranma to teach. Whatever, Akane was going to follow Kasumi's unspoken advice; to strive for a self made future.<p>Ranma could wait for the time being. Regardless of what Kasumi said, Ranma wasn't completely redeemed in Akane's eyes. Who knows, if she studied hard and stayed away for a short while, things would get better. It's not like Ranma was going anywhere<p>Having confined her thoughts on the martial artist, Akane focused on her studies. She needed to do well. The better she did, the more opportunities she would have later on.<p>Outside Akane's room, unknown to the youngest Tendo daughter, Kasumi leaned against the door. She was confused. In the heat of the moment, she had said many things, obviously on Ranma's behalf. Most of which she knew were definitely true.<p>She felt she didn't have the right to talk about Ranma's feelings to anyone, but she needed Akane to understand if their relationship was to get any better. If that pressure was taken off Akane, she could at least concentrate better in school to earn higher chances of having a bright future. Kasumi smiled at the thought. She would be the happiest girl in the world, were Akane to succeed in her life.<p>This brought her to another realization. Even if she enjoyed herself, went out, and did more in her life, it still wouldn't mean as much to her as her family did. Her family's happiness was her happiness.<p>Feeling slightly satisfied with her conclusion, Kasumi headed back to her room, entering it to find Ranma sitting there with his books open and working on a math problem.<p>"What took you so long?" he asked curiously.<p>"Oh...Please forgive me Ranma; I was having a long chat with Akane."<p>"Oh..." Ranma's eyes dropped back down, "Is she alright? I mean, she isn't all pissed off at me or something is she?"<p>"She seemed a little upset but it was alright. I managed to explain something to her that might have her understand the situation."<p>Ranma, leaning back against the wall, expertly twirled his broken pencil in his fingers, "Huh?"<p>Kasumi quickly summarized what happened in Akane's room, deciding on the spot to inform him as a way to apologize for speaking about him behind his back and without his permission, leaving Ranma completely bewildered.<p>"Wha…how? I didn't tell you that stuff about them attacking-"<p>"But you were scared weren't you? Especially after the attack at the wedding, you were scared they might start doing to a new level of attacks and get others hurt."<p>Ranma clenched his fists, not wanting to admit, until a snapping noise brought him and his companion out of their current thoughts. He glanced down his hand, then quickly away in annoyance.<p>"Aww man, that's the only pencil I had. Can I ever manage not to loose a god damn a pencil every other day?" he voiced angrily, unexpectedly making Kasumi favor him a one sided smile.<p>"Every other day? How do you manage to keep one for that long?" She joked, smiling sweetly at Ranma's annoying reprieve.<p>"I dunno, I just loose them after a day. Akane let me borrow this pencil, and it went through the works today. I was hoping it would last a little longer." Ranma commented dryly, staring at the broken pencil carefully to see if he could still use it. He could use it, but it wouldn't last for long.<p>"Anyways, please don't change the subject Ranma." Kasumi stated softly, sitting down on her bed, moving to take off her ribbon.<p>"Subject? Oh...That..." Ranma began slowly. He sighed deeply. "I ain't afraid of nothin'"<p>Kasumi gave Ranma a disapproved look, "Not for yourself, but for our sakes? I at least hoped that you would be honest with me."<p>"It's not that... Aw, god damn it. I, I hate being afraid..."<p>"What's so wrong with being afraid? I would think that everyone ever born would have fears."<p>"It's not that, I don't know how to explain it, you haven't experienced the Neko-Ken have you? The fear, it's like it controls me, and I hate it. I hate being controlled. I hate it..." Ranma looked away.<p>"And you don't know how to get rid of the fear, so much that you don't even want to admit it?"<p>"Uh, yeah, I guess…" Ranma shifted in his seat uncomfortably. Kasumi seemed to have this uncanny ability to get stuff out of him. When he didn't get any response, he glanced up to see Kasumi patiently waiting with her arms crossed.<p>"It's not like what pop- er, dad said. It's not just about men not being afraid, it's just that I hate fear. The last thing I want to do is let it be known." he explained.<p>"Ranma, the first step to overcoming fear is admitting it. Only when you face your fears can you overcome them."<p>"Oh? How do I face my fear of cats? Not just that, if I try and get rid of the other fiancees, how do I stop them from doing something that I fear? Anyway, lets just ignore it." Ranma eyes widened in surprise, "But hey!" he exclaimed. "How did you know?"<p>Kasumi provided him a compassionate look, "Ranma, after considering your past actions and understanding your mindset in the past few days, it's not that difficult to figure you out. You forget, I'm not as clueless as I may appear to be."<p>"Oh...S-sorry, I didn't mean to say you're clueless or nothin...I was just surprised."<p>"It's alright..."<p>"So how did Akane take it? I mean, what you told her?"<br/>"She was, how should I say it, initially surprised I was taking your side, but then understood. She is an understanding girl. I hope things will be better from now on."<p>"But aren't you worried about her reaction to you? I mean what happened the last time you tried to talk sense to her." Ranma clasped his hands behind his head.<p>"Oh that? I do not think Akane would behave in such manner anymore. I admit, at first I was a little fearful, but when we talked, it was obvious Akane has matured...if only a little. She was concerned for me." Kasumi beamed. To have the love of your family was indeed a great thing.<p>"That's nice to know," Ranma sighed, "Anyway, while you were gone, I was working on my math, and I did part of the home work, I couldn't get the rest though.<p>If Kasumi noticed the slightly depressed nature of Ranma's sight, she didn't question it, as she quickly went off to her bedside table and took out a couple of pencils.<p>"Here," she said, handing Ranma one, "A little present. I hope this lasts longer with you than the others did."<p>"Oh. Thanks Kasumi!" Ranma looked blankly at the pencil as Kasumi picked up Ranma's book and went through the answers to his questions.<p>"Good start, you got the first two questions correct Ranma. You're not that bad now are you?" she commented after a quick scanning.<p>"Ah...thanks."<p>Kasumi found herself to have spoken to soon as she realized that Ranma had gotten the rest of the 5 questions wrong. Ranma had not even shown his work so she could not figure out where he made the mistake.<p>"Ranma...it seems you would need to start showing your working when you do math problems. Examiners will still award you marks for correct working even if you get the answer wrong. There are also times when the examiner is actually looking for the working rather than the answer itself. Do you understand?" Kasumi murmured quietly, now scanning the questions and formulating a way to help Ranma solve the trig questions.<p>To his credit, Ranma was listening very intently. He did not want to disappoint Kasumi of all people, even though he was beginning to think of himself as dumb at times.<p>When he wondered that knowing only how to fight would not get him far in life, he came to a scary realization. He was shit at school. Granted he didn't pay much attention, and Akane always got angry when he kept on asking her for help in formulas in math.<p>"Umm..." Ranma winced at how feeble he sounded.<p>"Yes, Ranma?" His companion looked up from the book.<p>"Working? What do you mean by that?"<p>Kasumi blinked a couple of times, then smiled sweetly, making Ranma blink back in wonder. He was afraid she would be disturbed at the lack of Ranma's knowledge. Akane had sure been angry when he didn't understand or know something. His supposed fiancée started off really caring and nice, but lost her patience way too quickly...or maybe it was just him.<p>Ranma supposed that was probably because Ryoga was there as well to get in the way most of the time.<p>"Well, that answers the question on where we should start now doesn't it?" Kasumi grinned, beckoning Ranma to the bed.<p>"Don't you think its better if we just sit here though? More space?" he asked cautiously, eliciting a questioning look from the girl.<p>"Ranma, it's not a problem and you know it. Come on, I am sure its more comfortable here than on the ground." she replied affectionately.<p>The martial artist reluctantly got up and made his way to the bed, sitting opposite the Tendo girl, making sure to keep a comfortable distance.<p>"Okay Ranma, lets start off with the questions that you have already done correctly. I will now show you how to do the same question again, only this time show all the working... alright?" Kasumi said, rolling up the sleeves to her housedress.<p>"Yeah," Ranma commented, "But why are you rolling up your sleeves?"<p>"Hmm? Oh this..." She glanced at her hands, raising them, "I just like rolling them up before I start working, come to think of it, I haven't done this in a while."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow, "Uh. Sure. Whatever, I suppose. Everyone has their quirks, and I didn't mean that in a bad way." he quickly added.<p>Contrary to what he expected, Kasumi grinned at him, "Yes, we do all have our own quirks don't we? I suppose it defines us into our character. Okay then, shall we begin?"<p>"Sure," Ranma smiled, he hated studying, but this was beginning to sound like fun. It seemed to be a pleasant environment; one he didn't mind being in at all.<p>So he began his study.<p>He had contentedly found out that night, that Kasumi was in fact quite smart, and also knew how to explain what she taught quite effectively. By later on that night, Ranma had become ecstatic. He had reluctantly asked for help using formulas more than a dozen times.<p>Not once did Kasumi even raise an eyebrow when he did.<p>It took them an hour to complete his homework. They spent the next half hour discussing Ranma's other subjects as Kasumi asked him random questions to get a grasp of what Ranma knew.<p>Depression started gnawing at his current state of emotion at that. He realized how much he didn't know, having barely answered a fourth of Kasumi's questions regarding various subjects. The questions he did answer were not entirely correct either.<p>Kasumi then started off with teaching him some general science, working with physics and biology, stating they were one of her best subjects.<p>By around midnight, they had come back from biology to physics again because Ranma had shown some keen interest in it.<p>"Okay, I had a slight idea about those convection current thingies, but I never truly like realized what they did." Ranma said, staring at the pictures in his book, which was currently turned around in Kasumi's lap.<p>"This concept alone has a significant effect on our planet. Plate tectonics are heavily affected by the molten rock flow within the earth. They are also the cause of earth quakes, whether they are constructive or destructive." Kasumi commented, completely delighted with the fact that Ranma was so enthusiastically taking part in his studies.<p>She had not seen him study before, but she could tell he had never paid so much attention to any academic concept as he was doing so now.<p>"Constructive earthquakes? Constructive is a 'good' word right? What do ya mean by constructive earthquakes?"<p>Kasumi giggled at Ranma's naivety and began explaining how the molten rock between the core of the earth and the crust operated. She noticed how narrow Ranma's eyes were and how he flexed his fingers as he concentrated on every word that left her mouth, occasionally looking at the diagram of water in a beaker with arrows explaining how the flow would be if the beaker would be heated.<p>"That means," he said finally when Kasumi finished her explanation, "that heat and cold can simultaneously be used in other ways than in the Hi Ryu Shoten Ha! I can develop loads of variations. I don't even need air to do it. I can create techniques with water, hell I could even create a variations that could out do the bakusai tenketsu!"<p>Kasumi blinked momentarily at Ranma and sighed. It wasn't a surprise to know why he was paying so much attention. At least he was paying attention to her.<p>"Ranma, I am sure you have been taught this before. Why didn't you think about this then?" She enquired, tilting her head to the side and making Ranma smile. Such small actions showed more of her personality and he found it endearing being able to see more of the real her.<p>"Oh...well...I never really pay that much attention in class. Most of the time I am worried trying to solve some fiancée problem or trying to see if someone will give me a surprise attack or something. Also, the teachers are really boring. Maybe you should become a teacher Kasumi. You're really, really good. You know that? I didn't fall asleep. THAT'S saying something" Ranma grinned, his mirth and comment infecting Kasumi as she started giggling again.<p>"Teacher? Me?" she asked, slightly surprised. She had never thought about that prospect.<p>"Hell yea! You're good! I mean, you can teach really well. You're like a natural at it. You're really patient. If Akane was here, she'd have sent me to the moon ten times already 'cause I'm shit at learning this stuff." Ranma said, not entirely saddened at mentioning Akane's behavior. He was too involved with spending this time with Kasumi than to worry about anything else.<p>"Well Ranma, I wouldn't say you are 'shit' at learning 'this stuff'", Kasumi mimicked Ranma perfectly, making him start sweating, "I think you have learned the basics quite quickly. Initially you are a little slow, perhaps because you have not the mindset developed for academics. Once you do, I think you will do greatly." she smiled.<p>'Whew', Ranma relaxed. In his excitement he had forgotten to try and focus on his language. His respite however was not long lived, as he felt a sharp pull at his ear, making him almost yelp and get pulled down on the bed.<p>"While you are studying, I think this is a good chance for you to learn proper language from books. Don't you think?" Kasumi smiled innocently.<p>"Geh, sorry. I got a little excited and forgot." Ranma commented, still being held down by his ear.<p>"Oh, it's quite alright Ranma. I was just reminding you, that's all" Kasumi let go of his ear and ruffled his hair a little.<p>"Oi...I ain't-err I'm not a kid." Ranma said, yanking his head back.<p>"Oi, I didn't say you are." Kasumi stuck out her tongue, "Alright, lets get back to studies. I don't mind you trying to associate what you learn with martial arts, because I am sure it will double what you retain. I would, at the same time, like you to concentrate on all the general knowledge. I want this because you might not concentrate on something that you think might not help you in martial arts. I would like you to try to give all equal importance. Is that alright?"<p>"Yeah, that's alright Kasumi. I know what you mean. Sorry, but it just struck me all of a sudden. I dunno why I didn't think of it before." Ranma rubbed the back of his head thoughtfully.<p>"Well, you've already explained that now, haven't you? You're normally too busy sleeping, training, or trying to watch out for sudden appearances, attack, etcetera." Kasumi grimaced. It was totally understandable why Ranma was not into much else. The constant interference of other people had isolated his interests.<p>This was also, Kasumi assumed, the reason why Ranma kept training on the top of his priority list. Though he was, and occasionally is, quite arrogant, Ranma always justified it by training his heart out. On some subconsciously level, there was a drive to make sure that the constant rivals never got the better of him.<p>She guessed this attitude was probably brought upon when Ryoga learned the break point technique, and the urge became more evident when Ryoga came back with the Shi Shi Hokondan.<p>Kasumi realized just how much good this might do for Ranma. It will keep his mind away from depressing thoughts, and he will have to use it more than ever. As she just noticed, Ranma became more enthusiastic within each subject when he was given some sort of association with martial arts.<p>While she did not want to consolidate his thinking into only one track, there were many ways such knowledge could be put to use, she was quite happy to be aware of a way to raise Ranma's interest in his studies. All she had to do was to find some relevance to the arts within every subject to get him involved. He had promised to go the way, and he always kept his promises.<p>They continued studying late into the night and reluctantly had go to bed by 2 am. Ranma was at the time, quite interested in the chemistry and biology aspects now, having realized that he could have the know how to counteract any drugs Shampoo or Kodachi made.<p>To Kasumi's delight, he had understood that in order to do so, he needed to have a sound general knowledge about the entire subjects. She also insisted on telling him the other aspects of how these subjects were used in real life.<p>Deep down, however, Kasumi wanted Ranma to re-direct his focus in his studies so he would not be reminded of his problems. For now, she was happy he figured they could help him find a solution.<p>End Chapter 10
