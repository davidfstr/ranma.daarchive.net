</div>Chapter 4. An Evening of Revelations<p>Kasumi and Ranma continued to walk down the main city, towards no where really. Kasumi was intently listening to Ranma as he rattled off the whole 'weird stuff' about the 'Shadows of Honor' to her as quickly as possible. She had started to wonder where he stopped to breath in, he was speaking so fast!<p>He never was that good with words and he couldn't explain to Kasumi in a well worded and 'cool sounding' way as Koryu had but he tried any ways.<p>"So you see... I have been living under other people's shadow. Everything I thought I believed was something I had learned from others, mainly my father or mother. I didn't really accept most of the crap yet . know...So it was like I was having too many conflicts. Like killing Saffron... I suppose everyone thought that was for me to kill him to save Akane. I didn't . I just couldn't think killing anyone should be right. Also with the fiancee thing. Ukyo with her valid claim because of my idiotic pops. Shampoo and her laws. They also had honor. I was trying to respect that and you know..." Ranma explained...trying his best help Kasumi get his point.<p>"What about Akane?" asked Kasumi quietly.<p>"Well... it was about honor with her... but it wasn't that much about honor. She was the first person to really show me kindness. Maybe it was, but it wasn't anything the destructive duo had put in me. I felt it. I guess that is why I did so much for her. Besides, she kinda cute..sometimes. She's not as 'out to get me' as the others. Her attitude can be very annoying though." said Ranma after a minute's thought.<p>Kasumi positively beamed at that. Akane should be hearing this.<p>"Anyways, I'm being overshadowed by everyone elses shadow and casting my own shadow within their shadows... if you kinda get what I mean. I'm not as good as Koryu at explainin' stuff" Ranma muttered, a little disappointed.<p>He really wanted to make Kasumi understand his feelings right now. He really wished he had been better with words. He decided to continue when Kasumi put her arm in his and smiled, nodding slightly.<p>"Soo...what was best for me right now was to stand out in the light...and cast my own shadow. What I strongly believe about and how I think. I should continue doing that facing all my own problems, after being in soo many shadows, I should use what I had gained and any of the conflicts that exist because of them. I should solve by myself and for myself. Those decisions should be reflected in my own shadow. 'Cause when the darkness comes, I will be my shadow.. or my shadow will be me... get it?"<p>Kasumi found the last part a little confusing, the rest she thought she understood. She asked Ranma if he could elaborate.<p>"Well, this is hard to explain. Its got like more than one meaning. In the darkness, like in the dark times, like when I am in trouble. " he said.<br/>"I do stuff like... instinctively on what I believe. Its like when I go into Neko-ken, I will become the shadow that I have defined. If I have problems... then I will only feel troubled. I will not be able to face the dark times well. That's how its been like...right? hasn't it?" said Ranma with a smirk, he had been trying to use Koryu's words to explain. Hopefully it worked.<p>"I suppose you are right... This does make kind of sense. It is surprising that Koryu managed say this in such a deep way. He was always trying to get a rise out of me. I guess he just wanted me to feel like a normal girl. Sweet guy."<p>"He is cool, I guess. He really saved my ass." said Ranma. "Anyways.. so I had been sitting on the top of Furinkan High and thinking like of many situations of my past and how I would view them, personally, not how i am 'supposed' to view them.. ya get it? I tried to be fair in the situations. The answers seemed so simple that you have no idea how idiotic I feel. I guess I am stupid. My arrogance had only helped me think even less. I don't even know why I got so arrogant in the first place." said Ranma.<p>They had not been walking in any specific direction but Ranma had decided to let Kasumi guide him. He certainly had no problems with her holding his arm. He simply could not shake the warm feeling he had inside as she guided him to a nice looking restaurant as they walked in.<p>"Ranma you are not stupid. You are kind, quite intelligent, and a very sensitive person with a tough exterior. That is something that I have adored about you ever since I got to know you." Kasumi stated as she almost dragged Ranma to a table in a quite fancy Chinese restaurant.<p>"Adored..? err." Ranma stuttered.<p>"Is there anything wrong with that?" asked Kasumi. Ranma was still looking at her as she sat down on a table for two in the far side of the restaurant.<br/>He smiled finally when Kasumi was beginning to wonder if he was still insecure about talking freely with her.<p>"Nope...in fact I feel great, knowing that someone wants to be with me because of who I am, rather than a promise or the physical attributes."<p>With that, Ranma sat down opposite her. He didn't really have anything much to look at apart from her eyes, and her upper body that was looking absolutely stunning. He didn't have what it too to think about the lower body.<p>Luckily for him the menu had arrived and he just opened it up and looked at it, making sure it covered his face. He didn't want to stare at Kasumi. It might make her uncomfortable.<p>"Ah.. but the physical attributes are only extra cheese in the sandwich." he heard Kasumi say.<p>He lowered his menu and saw Kasumi looking at him with a wistful smile. This was something Shampoo usually or Ukyo usually gave him. It usually meant trouble. Her smile faltered a bit when she continued.<p>"I have never really trusted good looks. Ono Tofu is the only person, apart from you that is, that I think is good looking and has a decent personality. Just has a problem with looking at me. I dunno, it just does not feel right anymore. As charming as his problem was, I feel...warn out. To think that I actually tried to get him to overcome it by visiting him, talking to him and see if it could go anywhere from there. In the end, the patients just got a little annoyed with me because of re-scheduling their appointments whenever I came around. Apart from Tofu, there are people with good looks but thats the only thing that I found nice about them. I believe that the inner beauty makes the outer counterpart look even better, if looked at carefully." said Kasumi.<p>She realized she was gazing at the menu on the table, so she looked up at Ranma. He was looking at her with a gentle smile. It was a kind one. She really felt a bit relieved after telling Ranma.<p>Having once complained to Nabiki about this, Kasumi had still not felt better. Sometimes she still felt a bit agitated towards the whole scenario. But telling this to Ranma and seeing his smile made her feel as if she had taken a major load off her shoulders. She felt better. Oh so much better.<p>Ranma looked at her with a simple smile, grateful in a way that she was sharing with him as well, not just taking in his problems. What he found quite interesting was that he believed that she was going something through sometime quite similar to him. He decided to voice this opinion.<p>"You feel like its not worth it anymore. It doesn't feel the same. Its like.. you feel like you want it, but you are so screwed up, err or disheartened by it that you wanna like ... just let it go." he said, while in thought. This was something that he was currently feeling. This emotion, to let it go, was becoming exceedingly strong now.<p>Kasumi looked at Ranma in shock. He understood? He had just put into words the exact emotion that was currently flowing through her. The fact that it could have been better worded was not an issue, he was trying. She stayed wide eyed for a second before she recovered and smiled gratefully.<p>'He understands how I feel!' she sighed happily. The emotional build up was so strong that she was about to start crying. Maybe since yesterday, with Ranma she felt comfortable while crying. It was probably because he was there, crying with her.<p>Ranma had cried for his own reasons. But now he was willing to listen to her, and so accurately understand her feelings that she did not know what to make of it anymore.<p>"Kasumi?" asked Ranma, concern evident in his eyes.<br/>"Kasumi is everything alright?" he asked again.<br/>"Y-yes Ranma.. I'm fine. I was just totally taken by surprise. You... you explained my feelings so...so accurately that I was quite speechless." said Kasumi, a little teary eyed as she gently leaned forward and held his hand.<br/>Ranma did seem a little nervous, but he still managed to speak coherently. He didn't seem to mind any affection she started to show towards him, reason for doubt. It just didn't feel like the others. She seemed truly nice.<br/>"Yea...well, I would know though. I am going through the exact same thing you are. I feel the same way about Akane."  "Really? But I thought you where going to try with her again. I was quite certain that you would manage to do so, especially now that you have set your own priorities right!" said Kasumi.<br/>Ranma only smiled back.<p>"Relax Kasumi... lets order some food. We have plenty of time. It took me half an hour just on this one problem but I solved it. Don't worry, I am sure you will understand. You should also know that I am going to need you, a lot," Ranma said.<p>Kasumi smiled and only tightened her grip on Ranma's hand. She really did not want to let go. It just felt soo good. To be needed. She knew she was needed in her house.<p>Her family wouldn't last one day without her. But never had she been told it explicitly. It was a nice feeling. Wether or not Ranma noticed it, he was becoming more and more adult. All the more appealing.<p>She reluctantly let go of his hand and called the matieir'd to make her order. Everything proceeded perfectly. They had chattered about many things such as what Ranma had seen when he was in China, Kasumi indicated that she would love to travel, and they also ended up talking about Kasumi's high school life.<p>"So let me get this straight. You actually were feared among the guys who tried to hit on you because of the number of people you kneed in the groin?" laughed Ranma out loud. He just could NOT imagine Kasumi getting physical, in any way.<p>Kasumi only turned her head slightly to the right and looked at him very seductively, with her eyes half closed and a very, ohh a very alluring smile.<br/>"Oh, that was one of the things I did. I have done enough martial arts to know its not good to rely on only one technique." she said in a sensual voice.<br/>Ranma felt his stomach go cold from the look she was giving him. He only woke up from the brief coma he had entered when he heard Kasumi struggling not to howl with laughter.<p>She swayed right and left trying to forget the look that Ranma had given her a few moments ago. It was not working.<p>"Ranma, if I could do that to you, you should be able to imagine what I would have done to the male population in Furinkan High. Heck even half of the female population couldn't resist me at times." Kasumi said the last sentence more to herself but loud enough for Ranma to hear.<p>Ranma choked on the water he was currently drinking, setting down the glass and quickly about to wipe the mouth with his sleeve when Kasumi stopped him.<p>She took out a tissue and slowly wiped the water dripping from his mouth and onto his shirt collar, that had gotten a little wet.<p>Ranma sat there amazed at her personality. She actually looked like a real girl. He really had missed out on a great person since he came here.   They seemed to be getting along great.<p>Getting along with someone? When was the last time he truly got along with someone. When did he EVER get along with someone without things messing up. Wait.. that meant something was gonna screw this great time up soon... wasn't it?<p>Then he remembered Koryu's words. He said he would keep trouble away for tonight. Well... just for one night. Ranma would willingly throw away anything he had, not that he had much, just for tonight.<p>"That look was priceless. I bet you that if I had not laughed, I would have been able to take your pants off without you noticing." joked Kasumi. Slowly, but surely, Kasumi was opening up more and more to Ranma. She had so far only been assured that he could take it.<p>It was give and take. Ranma opened up to her yesterday, today, she really wanted to as well. She was rewarded with more a hilarious sight upon doing so.<p>Ranma instinctively brought his hands to his belt, looking down to see if he was still dressed in pants, his eyes so wide Kasumi thought they would drop out of his sockets.<p>That...apparently was too much as she was set off laughing uncontrollably for the next few minutes.<p>"You are so adorable Ranma! Its so easy to tease you. ahh.. Aw its been a long time since I've laughed like THAT!" Kasumi writhed in laughter, managing to get a control on her breathing.   Her stomach was starting to hurt.<p>"Earlier Koryu told me something funny and I laughed quite a bit but... this ... oh Ranma you are definitely worth spending time with!"<p>Ranma really didn't get what was about him that had set off laughing, but he wasn't complaining. This was the first time a girl had laughed at him, in enjoyment at being in his company.   It being Kasumi made it all the more fun. He liked her laugh. He almost felt like a deer caught in the headlights at her display. If she had held herself back, he was opening up to him now. To have someone trust him like that, sent a feeling of warmth throughout his body.<br/>In his entire life, no one had ever raised this kind of emotion in him. He knew this to be a fact. He began to love this feeling instantly, it was addictive.<p>"I'm really glad. But I'm sorry if I am a little shocked.. I kinda haven't seen you behave like this..well ever. You are like..." Ranma couldn't find the proper word.<p>"A woman?" Kasumi suggested.<p>"err. yea. I guess... care free as well." Ranma tried to explain.<p>"Ranma... if you want I can help tutor you to speak properly...and if you would like... I can even help you out with school. I have gone through it. I do remember being a good student." said Kasumi.<p>"Sure, no problem. That'd be great! but Why haven't ya behaved like this with Dr Tofu.. I am sure something would have happened... I mean. I just can't imagine you being ... caged up like this...sorry if I'm being blunt or anything." said Ranma.<p>"Ha! Dr. Tofu would have to shut down the clinic if I behaved like this. Trust me... he would be stuck talking to betty-chan for the rest of his life." laughed Kasumi.<p>"Why not with the family. I think they would love this side of you." Ranma argued.<p>Kasumi thought about this for a second before she answered his question. Her reply was relaxed, and serious. She spoke confidently, suggesting that she had thought about this before.<p>"You know how old fashioned father is Ranma. Akane's fixation with 'perverts'-" Kasumi did a little quotes sign with her fingers.   "-also wouldn't be of any help at all if her own   sister was a little crude at times, even if seldom. She   seems to have such a good impression of me. A wonder why   doesn't she adopt it. Besides, I really am being myself  at home. I love my family, and doing things for  them brings me joy. I just have to cut back on my  self a bit on things I enjoy such as ... being a girl  I suppose. I do enjoy reading so I suppose it was not   torture. But now... Now I feel as if I have been set free  from a cage. Strange isn't it? I never really felt that  caged. Now I know I was." explained Kasumi<p>"You know... I'm really honored that you are behaving  like this with me... you're opening up. I just feel so   bad about ignoring you like every one else and-"<p>Kasumi leaned down a bit towards the table looking up into Ranma's eyes. He had to glance away; he didn't want to stare at what was obviously, if not intentionally, being shown. He had a strange feeling that he just might develop Dr Tofu's disease, complex or whatever it was.<p>"Ranmaaaaaaaa. Its ok. Water under the bridge. Besides, I also feel a little guilt at not being able to help you and my family better. Lets try not to ruin this night by that kind of talk. Or you will find out why Koryu really didn't want to come."<p>"I think I already have an idea. Its good that you  opened up to him. I think he's a great guy. He seems to be  hiding a lot of things though." said Ranma<p>"Thats up to him...I did enjoy my time with him and he did get me to open up. But you Ranma.. I am so glad we're spending this time tonight. I wouldn't miss this for the world."<p>"I was thinking that a few moments ago." said Ranma.<p>Kasumi smiled affectionally took Ranma's hand again squeezing it for good measure. "I am a girl Ranma, and I think like a girl. Playing around with cute guys is always something a girl would want to do. It is rare however, to come across a diamond. You are a diamond Ranma. And it looks like I'll be doing a lot of polishing from now on. I wasn't you nice and shiny." Kasumi smirked evilly.<p>Ranma went beet red with embarrassment. Then he smiled and looked at her with a devilish smile.<p>"I don't think I'd mind." he said.<p>Kasumi did raise an eyebrow at that remark while picking up the a glass of water to drink.<p>"Sure you wouldn't." she said shyly, putting the glass down, winking.<p>Time flew. Though at what speed was a question that would never enter their mind. The time Ranma and Kasumi enjoyed together as two people who shared similar pain, and understood each other, was not expendable.<p>Food had come, it had been eaten. Jokes were made and were accompanied by laughter. It was while they were eating desert when Kasumi decided to raise what Ranma mentioned about Akane.<p>"What did you mean about Akane earlier on? I do believe things might be different between you and I. I mean, at least you can talk to her. I cant even talk to Tofu." said Kasumi, tracing circles around her pudding with her spoon, slowly hoping to get an answer.<p>Ranma closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair. He preferred not talking about anything that depressed him right now when he was enjoying himself so much, but he did need Kasumi's help.<p>She was still very worried for him. She was still worried for him when she herself was slightly hurting because of the lack of 'life' and her family's problems. Not to mention Dr Tofu.<p>He had just made a decision to spend more time with Kasumi, with her permission of course, and do whatever he can to make her feel as radiant as she looked tonight. After all, seeing her happy and care free did much to make him feel better. He felt that he wouldn't mind spending the whole day doing that.<br/>Maybe it was because he had never felt this before, this feeling inside his heart that warmed him to no end. A plunge into the polar regions wouldn't have been able to take this feeling away.<p>The word 'beautiful' would never even begin to describe Kasumi's radiance tonight. Ranma had a deep feeling that he wouldn't mind fighting Saffron a hundred times just to spend even another a minute with her, like he has done tonight. He would even except defeat to do so.<p>"Kasumi, " Ranma spoke up, while in the same posture.<p>"What is Love? Why do we have to get married? Why do we have to be a couple? This took me half an hour to sort out, I am surprised I can still think right now. I am like, really sure about this answer that I managed to bug out of my brain." he continued.<br/>Kasumi was quite impressed with Ranma's ability to actually try and delve deeper. He really was trying very hard. This was proof that he was growing up rapidly. She didn't reply, thinking that these were probably rhetorical questions.<p>"Me and Akane, and I ain't even gonna talk about the other fiancees, are being forced together. Half of our problems are because we are being forced to and are forcing crap on each other. I admit, I am also a real guilty idiot. Akane is still messed up about the fiancee thing. Me to. We've only caused problems. Maybe Akane and me will solve things, but there will still be so many other problems. She really needs to stop thinking that each and every boy is a pervert. She also needs to get over her jealousy. I was really angry this morning."<p>Kasumi got the drift. She had an idea of where Ranma was heading. She cut him off, caring to complete the explanation.<p>"So you are saying, that our parent's honor will only drive you both and everyone else towards more pain. Even if you did get married."<p>"Exactly!" Ranma exclaimed, tilting his head upwards still with his eyes closed, leaning back. He folded his arms across his muscular chest.<p>"I don't see no shit honor in making your kids suffer for your own ambition. Its not right. Heck, I am sick and tired of this, and I sure as hell ain't gonna watch Akane suffer."<p>"Language, Ranma, you are in front of a lady" Kasumi chided with a smile. She didn't mind him swearing, but he did need to start learning to speak properly.<p>"Well any ways, my honor will not accept hurting people for ambition. I'm going to break the engagement and ask her if we should just be friends. There are things I want to do, and I know there are things she wants to do. I do want her to be happy. Lets see how things go from there. Life is important. Its too precious to be trashed like this. I ain't.. er am not gonna stand for it. If we do finally get along perfectly and get rid of our flaws, I don't mind marriage. But then again...caring for somebody and wanting to be with somebody for the rest of your life are two different things."<p>Kasumi sweetly smiled at Ranma's attempt to clean up his wording. She was also surprised at his rate of understanding. Every time she thought that he could not surprise her anymore, he did just that. After a moments silence Kasumi found an answer to that thought.<p>Ranma had the habit to focus everything he could muster to face the problems he had. They had usually been regarding fights, most of the time. He had never thought of this because he always pushed away by the 'manly' speech from his mother and honorable speech from his father. He never thought anything through.<p>Now that he was carefully explained to ignore what his parents had confused him with, he had thought for himself with the freedom of mind and emotions. He had come across these issues and found his own answers.<p>That was another thing that was extremely similar between Ranma and Kasumi. Even if the reasons governing them were totally different, they had both been quite restrained from being what they could...would be.<p>Adding that to the fact that they had both, essentially been lonely, Kasumi concluded that she shared a lot in common with the young handsome warrior sitting in front of her.<p>"Our parents won't like this."<p>"They have their honor, I have mine. I am tired of this anyways. Maybe after some time apart, we can solve things even though I don't want to any more... I want to move on."<p>Ranma opened his eyes and looked at her with a smirk, quirking one eyebrow down and arching the other up.<p>"What are they gonna do? Fight me?"<p>Kasumi smiled at him, hiding a blush. "They will trick you, and assuming you are going to break off engagements with everyone else, elder Ku Lon, Shampoo and Ukyo will not stand idly." she pointed out.<p>"As I said earlier. Its going to be only trouble, but all I know is that if you are gonna be there with me. I will get through it. I need someone I can trust and relieve some of my stress. That ki blast I let off today was a real pain. I was imagining putting all my crap in there, and lettin' it go. Lets just say that I would rather be held by you any day." Ranma blurted out before he realized what he said. When he did, he went a little red... but still smiled.<br/>He knew Kasumi would understand. She hadn't given him any reason up till today to panic. Besides, she was gorgeous.<p>"Deal." she replied with a slight wink, holding out her hand for a hand shake. Ranma shook her hand, when he noticed how soft and delicate it was.<p>As they shook, Kasumi glanced at her watch just to see what time it is.<p>"Oh my! I don't believe we've been here so long.<br/>We better get home otherwise everyone's going to be worried."<p>Ranma looked confused. "We haven't been here so long.<br/>What time is it?"<p>"9:00"<p>"whoa, thats .. what three or four hours? Have we been here that long?"<p>Kasumi nodded quickly before looking for the Matieir'd. They received the bill and Ranma had paid from the money he had in his pocket. Soon they had quickly left the establishment walking towards home.<p>"Koryu gave you that much money?" Kasumi asked, surprised.<p>"I didn't even know when he managed to put it in or where he got it from. I just remember putting my hands in my pocket and felt a thick packet. A stack of notes rapped by a paper with a note attached to it" Ranma explained.<p>"It said, 'You may be here for a while trying to sort things out so here's lots of money incase you get really hungry and feel like eating out Nerima.'" came a voice from behind the two.<p>Ranma and Kasumi turned around to see Koryu slowly walking towards them.<p>"Hey man. As promised, no one bugged ya. I suppose today was just your lucky day. A good choice to buy some clothes Ranma. You are quite intelligent aren't ya?" Koryu said as he walked towards the couple.<p>Ranma had the impulse to agree. But that would just be plain arrogance. He still had a long way to go. He had to break his dishonorable habits. He decided to shake his head slightly with a sad smile.<p>"No... not really. But I am glad I did. I can really say that tonight was the best night I ever had in my entire life. Ya think ya would want to go out sometime with me again?" Ranma asked dumbly, looking at Kasumi.<p>Kasumi replied with a long and drawn out tight hug, which she had jumped into. At first Ranma's body was about to go into a comatose state again, she had not felt this soft when she held him last night, or this morning.<p>Slowly the events of last night, this morning and the rest of the day flooded his mind causing him to comfortably put his arms around Kasumi to return the embrace.<p>"Thank you Kasumi." Ranma whispered.<p>"Your welcome, Ranma... and thank you, for   letting me be the real me. This night was also the best  I have ever had in my life." Kasumi breathed into Ranma's   neck<p>Koryu stood there, he did have something to say, to let them know that he had to rest for a while. He had helped them out when he really should have rested.<p>His body still had poison running through it and he needed rest. He had half the mind to tease them, but he chose against it.<p>"Hey you two. Listen up. I kept you safe from everyone else. There were several people looking for you. One stupid guy with a statue fetish, Moose I think. He thought you were that statue. " Koryu shook his head in dismay. What was wrong with this city? And that pervert freak. Koryu didn't know if he was looking for Ranma or chasing women.   He had taken care of him quite well.<p>Anyways. That ki blast was your idea man. You reap what you sow. From now on you're completely on your own. I have done more than enough, I believe. I shouldn't have done this but I couldn't forget Kasumi-chan's face this morning when she asked me to help you Ranma. So I guess I risked things a little bit." said Koryu.<p>"Thank you, Oni-chan" said Kasumi affectionately. Her voice was muffled because she was still in Ranma's arms. They slowly disengaged, Ranma turning and starting to walk towards Koryu.<p>"Thanks. If there is anyway I can repay you.."  Ranma bowed.<p>"Che-. No need. I was the one repaying you and Kasumi. So drop it. Now, I'm gonna be around, but you wont see me. I need to... rest. My wounds have opened up a bit but don't worry. I'll be fine.. I will meet up with you guys in a few days or a week or something. I just wanted to say two things Ranma. Firstly, don't forget that ninja, Sasuke. Just making sure." said Koryu.<br/>He then did a one eighty and started walking away.<br/>"What was the second thing?" Ranma asked behind him.<br/>Koryu raised his right hand, waving with his back towards Ranma and Kasumi.<br/>"I've done my bit. You're on your own now. You will reap what you sow Ranma." Koryu repeated, continuing to walk away.<br/>Ranma laughed at that for a moment. "I wouldn't want it any other way!" he shouted back at him.<br/>He turned around to see Kasumi waiting for him. He began to walk towards her when his ears caught something.<br/>"Feh... Now she calls me Oni-chan" Koryu muttered to himself, with his hands in is pockets, kicking a nearby can so that it flew and landed in a bin a few feet ahead of it.<p>"Lets get home. Pop's gonna be ragin' like a hippo."  Ranma said, taking Kasumi's arm.<p>"Ranmaaa.." Kasumi chided.<p>"huh?.. oh sorry. I'll try to be more careful" muttered the pig tailed martial artist, walking casually towards home.<p>"What do we say to them?" Kasumi asked as they got near home.<p>"Don't worry. I got it." said Ranma confidently.<p>They entered the Tendo compound after fifteen minutes and were walking up to the door when they heard Akane's voice.<p>"You're back you Baka! Where were you? We've been looking all over for you!" came Akane's voice from her window.<p>After that, Soun quickly stumbled out of the house.<p>"Where have you been Kasumi? What took you so long?" he asked.<p>"I'm sorry we lost track of time. My friend, Koryu took me to a movie and then we went to a restaurant. I hope you weren't too worried." Kasumi said.<p>Ranma noticed that she spoke in the same manner as she had during the day, and had always had. It was just that her more active and lively personality didn't filter in. The occasional wink or tease or refreshing remark didn't exist.<p>"Next time you are out with a friend and are going to stay out late, just give a call ok? Who was this friend anyways. Where is he? Soun asked.<p>"umm. maybe we should go inside first?" asked Ranma. It was getting chilly and he didn't want Kasumi getting cold. Her arms and legs were bare.<p>Soun considered that and then immediately ushered them in. Akane and Nabiki were already there standing on the stairs. Akane had an annoyed look on her face and Nabiki was smirking.<p>"Nice clothes Ranma." commented Nabiki.<p>Akane looked at Kasumi and Ranma with a blank face. She didn't know what to think.<p>"Kasumi, you went out with Ranma?" she asked.<p>"Of course not silly." Kasumi giggled.<p>"Um.. I kinda ran into them in the city. The Koryu guy was nice enough to buy me some formal clothes and we went on to the restaurant. I guess time away from the house was what I needed." said Ranma.<p>"He bought you that!" asked Nabiki, unbelieving. Those clothes looked expensive.<p>"Awfully nice of him wasn't it?" Kasumi beamed.<p>"Where is he?" Akane said, visibly less angry than she had been before when she saw Ranma and Kasumi walking in, arm in arm.<p>"Oh he had to leave, he said he may come around again soon, I hope he does. We had lots of fun today." replied Kasumi.<p>"Oh man! I forgot my clothes! Che! I'll have to go to the shop and get them tomorrow I guess. Man I'm tired." said Ranma. with a  was feeling very exhausted. He assumed it was because of that ki blast. He had no idea how powerful that thing was, nor did he want to find out.<p>"Tomorrow's school you dummy." said the anger prone girl.<p>"Oh yea.. Sorry. I forgot." said Ranma after a moment.<p>Only Kasumi had noticed Ranma's body tense up, because she was still holding onto his arm.<p>"Akane, that was not nice. Anyways, father, I'm sorry but I am also quite tired myself." she said towards her father.<p>Kasumi then turned toward Ranma smiled.<p>"Thank you for helping me back home Ranma. If you could just take me to my room, I would be grateful."<p>Ranma had been about to give her a blank look when he felt her grip tighten on his arm slightly. He shrugged his shoulders and agreed.<p>"I'll help you sis" offered Akane, stepping down. Kasumi turned to her and gave a big smile. Akane was such a sweet girl.<p>"Its quite alright, besides isn't it a man's job to escort?"<p>They continued up as Akane and Nabiki moved out of the way, letting them continue towards Kasumi's room.<p>They reached the door and Kasumi took out the key from her hand bag to unlock it.<p>"Damn pop ain't home ye-" was all Ranma could whisper as Kasumi dug her heel into his foot.<p>"ouch."<p>"You promised, Ranma." Kasumi whispered back, opening the door and walking into her room. She turned around and winked at him.<p>"Good night Ranma. Thank you." she continued in her usual cheery manner.<p>Kasumi then closed the door on Ranma's face.<p>"Good night Kasumi, your welcome, and thank you."<p>Ranma sported a bored, dumb look on his face as he turned around and almost walked into Akane and Nabiki who were currently looking at him curiosity.<p>"Cologne came by, looking for you. She said she felt a powerful spike of ki energy. It came from Furinkan High. She was trying to look for you to see if you were involved, and alright. We even heard the boom." Nabiki explained, getting to the point immediately.<p>"We were worried about you. You had left in the morning and were nowhere to be found. Everyone was looking for you. We just got back about half an hour ago." continued Akane.<p>Ranma felt a slight pang of guilt for making them worry. He had the greatest evening of his life. Then he laughed a little. If this was fate's way to giving Ranma and Kasumi a little relief at their expense, it was sure a funny one.<p>"What's so funny?" asked Akane. She had been quite annoyed all morning after Ranma's and then Kasume-nee's outbursts but had thought about it for a bit in the Dojo. Then in the evening she heard about the energy spike and was worried for Ranma ever since. Now he was laughing?<p>"Sorry, I just remembered something. Don't worry. I was the cause of that spike. I just wanted to vent all my frustrations in one big ki blast. I am also quite exhausted because of that stupid thing. I ain't got even got enough to walk to my room now." stated Ranma. He felt weak in the legs, immediately responding to that by leaning against the wall.<p>"Ranma?" Akane asked coming over to him. Nabiki was also there.<p>"Akane, I can understand, but I didn't think ya would be worried Nabiki." Ranma smirked.<p>Akane looked down as she blushed a bit. Nabiki kept a cool outlook as she helped Akane drag Ranma in his room and laid him down.<p>"I am only protecting my long term assets" she said with a Cheshire grin as she walked out of his room soon after.<p>Akane looked as if she was going to say something when Ranma spoke up.<p>"Its ok Akane. I'll be here in the morning. We can talk then. Sorry, but I am really, really tired. We did a lot of walking today with Koryu." Ranma muttered sleepily, twisting around.<p>"Sure Ranma. Good night. Sweet dreams." Akane said as she walked out of the room, switching off the light on her way out to her room to finally get some sleep.<p>Oh yea. Ranma would definitely be having sweet dreams.<p>In her room, Nabiki sat with on her bed with her legs crossed. She really wanted to know what was going on. She didn't want to prod but something just didn't add up right. Maybe she'll have a talk with Kasumi tomorrow and get some answers or better explanations of what happened today.   The city had been searched by Cologne, Shampoo, Akane and Happosai.<br/>She supposed the old pervert wanted to know the source of the spike as well.<br/>Anything weird happening in Nerima was almost always related to Ranma.<br/>Moose wasn't any help at all. He only caused problems. It really looked as if the visibly impaired boy had a statue fetish.<br/>'Ohh well.. I'll get my answers in the morning, one way or another' she thought to herself as she lay down in her bed, twiddling her new bedside lamp off. She slowly drifted off to sleep.<p>End of Chapter 4
