</div>Chapter 7 : The Aura of Protection<p>Back at the Furinkan High, Ranma sat out on the roof of the building, where he had sat yesterday. He was sitting in lotus pusition with his eyes close, concentrating very hard.<p>What he needed, was to be able to stay focused in order to be able to use ki constantly during a fight. It had proven to be a big asset, he just didn't have the stamina to infuse his ki throughout his entire body at a constant rate yet.<p>Ranma wasn't worried. He knew he could do it. It would work and as soon as he had it done, he would challenge Koryu for a rematch. Ranma hoped he hadn't left yet, it would be depressing to not have another fight with someone having Koryu's calibur. Ranma had particularly relished the fight they had.<p>He didn't want to fight Koryu to win. In fact he had some sort of feeling that he did not stand much of a chance right now. Koryu was hiding something enormous. Some hidden power. It was quite obvious he was hiding because he was a Ninja. That was what they were supposed to do.<p>He still wanted to fight him in any case and he knew that after a while he would be as good as Koryu. And if his tenacity had anything to do with it, Ranma would become better than Koryu.<p>Somehow, Ranma knew that Koryu might believe in that as well.<p>Ranma continued to meditate when he sensed someone creep up behind him. It was a sneaky feeling. He had this sloppy feeling of needles being pressed against different parts of his body. For a second he concentrated harder and the feeling left.<p>He turned around to look at Gosunkugi standing about 10 feet behind him.<p>He mumbled something, inaudibly.<p>"What?" Ranma said.<p>"Its not working!"<p>"What's not working?"<p>"The doll. This is supposed to work, you aren't succumbing."<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes at that. "Doll huh, you wouldn't be trying to play around with me could you?" he said in a low and threatening voice. He saw that Gosunki had some needles in his hands and a few papers with some weird writing on it. He could clearly see the doll that accompanied the rest of Gosinki's gear.<p>Gosunkugi chose the best possible action in his current predicament and ran away at once.<p>"Che-. Chicken" Ranma turned back and went into concentration again. So thats why he felt those needles. He supposed that the voodoo thing was also spiritual in nature. Since Ranma's spirit was becoming stronger, it was getting harder to take him down with such tricks.<p>Ranma smiled. This was something else he wanted to tell Kasumi when he went home. He wondered what she was doing right now. He hoped she would be happy when he told her of his day. He wanted to see her smile. It brought him happiness. He had a sour feeling that she would be his only source of happiness for a while now.<p>The school day had been fine. There had been murmurs around the whole school about that had taken place in the morning. It was quite annoying to say the least but it got better. Hiroshi and Daisuke were muttering amongst themselves about something being different.<p>All in all, people had left him alone. Akane was quiet, even when they both had to old buckets for a while in the morning for being late.<p>Luckily , Ranma had the permission given by Miss Hinako to get hot water so he could change to his original form. This was given to him because most of the guys were looking at Ranma all funny.<p>He didn't know what changes came over him. Whatever the change was caused girls to fawn over him; it even made Kasumi almost drool. The change carried over to his female form as well; when one of the guys asked him to "check things out", he promptly threw him out the window to cool off in the pool.<p>No one else had the guts to say anything else.<p>Ukyo, surprisingly remained quite as well. He assumed that she was biding her time. She had a smug look on her face, and Ranma didn't like it.<p>He wanted to deal with all his problems, but facing them all at the same time or immediately one after another was not something he was willing to do.<p>Ranma sat and mulled some more. He considered his life; it has always been filled with conflicts. His life will probably bring lots of conficts wherever he would go...<p>His life just needed to slow down a little.<p>The rest of the day passed just as the morning had. Nothing much happened. Apart from the teacher nearly dropping his jaw to the ground when Ranma had asked a question in class.<p>He wanted the time to pass quickly so he figured he would listen and focus. It was, he supposed, another form of mental training.<p>At the end of the school, Ranma slowly walked out as Akane caught up to him.<p>"Ah... Hey Akane, could you go home without me today? I am gonna go and do some more of my training. Alright?"<p>Akane looked at him for a second before she answered back, a little meekly. She had wanted to come watch or maybe train with Ranma. After witnessing Ranma this morning, she had really started to feel that he was getting way too good. She wanted to be good as well.<p>"Um... could I come watch?"<p>"Eh? ... umm yea I suppose. No damn! I gotta go down town and get my clothes. Look Akane, I'll be honest with ya. It is the same routine I go through everyday. I'm doing my katas. All I am doing is starting them off slow, then slowly doing them faster and faster. After a while I keep on interchanging whenever I feel like and see if my body can follow through." Ranma explained.<p>He didn't want to explain anything about Koryu to her. He just couldn't say much. He knew he would let something slip and it would cause problems. He was bad with words.<p>"Oh..."<p>"Look, really I wouldn't mind you coming. Its just that... well"<p>"Its ok Ranma. I understand. I'll go home and do the same."<p>"Huh?"<p>Ranma watched, stunned as Akane turned around and running towards home.   'She took that rather well. I guess she's still happy about what I blurted out this morning. It was alright though. I have come to terms with my feelings. She's still just learning about hers.' Ranma thought to himself before he leaped off into the sky just barely missing Kuno running, in sputtering something about witnessing using magic to defeat him in the morning.<p>As he jumped from rooftop to rooftop, Ranma started to employ the momentum driven technique as he kept on pushing himself. He really enjoyed it. It was fun. He could literally feel his muscles breathing as it were.<br/>While he was jumping, he felt a dirty presence; a presence that felt so sickening that Ranma had to stop to see who the hell it could be. He searched around and saw Happosai running on a rooftop not too far from where Ranma was standing.<p>Ranma didn't want to deal the complete one piece pervert from head to toe, so he was about to jump off in the opposite direction when he felt Happosai's gaze fall upon him.<p>Just great... now what?<br/>Ranma stood where he was as the source of the sickening feeling started to draw closer to him. In a few moments, it was right behind him.<br/>The soft landing of the panty pervert augmented the senses, telling him that the old man was standing a few feet away from him.<p>"So Ranma m'boy, we finally meet. I was looking for you yesterday."<p>"You were huh? Sorry, freak but I was out with a friend."<p>Happosai looked at Ranma with wide eyes, before his face contorted into a collection of wrinkles as he started laughing like a maniac.<p>"What's so funny you old freak? If you want to leave, fine. But I have to go someplace. Do ya mind?"<p>Happosai stopped laughing after a minute before he looked at Ranma. "Ranma. Since when did you truly have a friend. I mean a real friend."<p>"Hey I do have friends!"<p>"Those friends that chose to ruin your wedding?"<p>Happosai started to laugh again.<p>Oh yeah, since he had been so focused about his training with this new technique and Kasumi he had momentarily forgotten about the other troubles. Be that as it may, it was not bad. He had almost completely recovered from the dreaded feelings he had day before yesterday.<p>"Whatever old man. I gotta go. I was out with Kasumi and a friend of hers  yesterday. If you were looking for me, sorry I couldn't be found. I was right here  walking around the city. Its not my fault you couldn't find me."<p>"I bet you it is your fault that I lost my pretties."<p>Ranma stopped and looked at the little old pervert like his head was one big large pimple.<p>"As I said. I had nothing to do with anything. I am telling the truth.<br/>I swear it on my honor."<p>That stopped Happosai for a second.<p>"On your honor, you say?"<p>"Yea." Ranma leveled Happosai with a serious look.<p>'Hmm Something seems different about this boy. The massive energy spike yesterday does seem to be because of him, he seems to have become stronger and posses a lot more ki. Probably because of his anger towards everything that has happened lately. Well, I do have more important things to do that waste time with him. I have to collect my pretties all over again. Hmm, if it wasn't him, then why did I trip and fall yesterday? Strange. Oh well.' Happosai thought to himself.<p>"Oh well, I'd love to stay and chat but I gotta goo!"<p>Happosai bounced off the building and went off to what was probably another one of his panty raids.<p>Ranma wanted to stop him. His honor wouldn't let something like this go  was the grand master of his school damnit! He didn't want Happosai to ruin the name of the school.<p>But Ranma had to stay. He had to be patient. He couldn't go off fighting the old master so soon. He needed time to train and get even stronger.<p>Eventually, he would beat the pervert into oblivion and would take grand master title away from Happosai.<p>But not now.<p>The day passed very quickly after that. Ranma had found his clothes soon after the meeting with the shrunken coconut headed pervert.<p>The shopkeeper was nice enough to put them in a bag and wait for him. The guy had a gleam in his eye when he told Ranma that had he seemed quite oblivious yesterday evening to everything when he had seen a lovely young lady in a black evening dress, and had quickly walked out to greet her.<p>Ranma told him it was nothing much and that she was a close friend. The man had made a comment about Ranma being lucky, but Ranma shrugged it off.<p>She was a friend. Right?<p>That was what she needed, Ranma didn't know what he needed exactly. He just knew he needed her to be there for him. He did suppose he was lucky in that aspect.<p>He brought his clothes in a bag and found an empty training lot to continue  with his training. He found that his moves were going perfectly.<p>He re-did the move he tried on Kuno that morning after practicing the katas for about half an hour. When he did it and got back up, he turned to find something interesting on the ground where his foot had pivoted.<p>There was a hole in the ground. Now this was strange. It was slightly hollow, but his was the road. Why did his ankle do this much damage to the road?<p>Well that was sort of simple to answer. He had infused it with ki. That had damaged the road while he while he performed his sweep kick.<p>Damn.<p>Koryu had swept during their sparring session. But he had not destroyed the dojo floor. What had he done?<p>Keeping that in mind, Ranma tried to continuously re-do the entire thing again and again, leaving lots of holes in the ground, to try and find out a way to not damage the ground.<p>The ki was doing the damage, as well as the pressure he puts on his ankles because he's using the entire strength of his body.<p>Did Koryu use ki differently? How did he manage to do that?<p>The pondering on that had taken quite a while as Ranma didn't give up in trying to find a way to cause less damage while he was infusing ki. He had to somehow control the ki so that it didn't do damage.<p>He was concetraing so hard on his problem that he lost track of time, he didn't even realize it was sunset when the street light came on.<p>After a while, he was too tired to continue. Considering this to be a good time to go home, Ranma picked up his clothes from the corner wall and roof hopped back home.<p>"Oh man I gotta get home. I even gotta tell Kasumi what happened today. Its going to be amazing!"<p>He suddenly felt a great deal of strength come from inside of him, quickly taking off to the roof tops to his home.<p>"I'm home!" Ranma announced as he came inside. He went straight to the kitchen where he found Kasumi making dinner.<p>"Kasumi!"<br/>She was busy adding a little extra spice to the broth. Upon hearing the voice she looked up. A large smile broke on her face.<br/>'This is what I wanna see, I wouldn't mind seeing this everyday' the young warrior thought to himself, returning Kasumi's smile with an idiotic grin.<p>"I have some really cool stuff to tell you about what I did today. Well I also have some problems but, you know maybe if you can tutor me, that would give us the excuse to talk. I- Is that OK with you? Sorry for barging in like this."<p>Kasumi looked at Ranma with slightly bemused expression on her face before she answered. "Sure Ranma, I wouldn't mind that at all. I also have some very interesting news to tell you."<p>"Really? Cool. Well, yeah I have some problems coming as well I just wanted to talk to you and sort them out. Is after dinner OK?<p>"Sure Ranma. No problem," Kasumi said as she drooled over Ranma's body. "Oh, and Ranma?"<p>Ranma turned around in mid-step to look at her.<p>"Welcome back."<p>"Thanks." Ranma grinned.<p>He walked out the kitchen and into the living room, sitting down, waiting for dinner.<p>Everything that happened today passed through his mind. From the morning, when he left the Tendo home, all the way through his brief encounter with Happosai and the time he spend in the empty parking lot.<br/>It was a good day, but something seemed missing. He couldn't put his finger on it.<p>Soun Tendo came into the room and sat down next to him, bringing his news paper to read as he begun to speak with Ranma.<br/>"I heard from Nabiki that you protected Akane's honor today" he said.<br/>Ranma snorted. He had a feeling something was missing. This was it. He didn't want to announce the breaking of the engagement yet. He wanted to talk to Kasumi first. Then he wanted to talk to Akane. Only after that would he break the news to the family heads. He only hoped he wouldn't have to break their heads while he was at it.<p>"I only protected my honor today." Ranma replied.<p>"What do you mean Son? You fought for her today, like a fiancee should!"<p>Ranma relaxed his entire body, taking in a deep breath before answering. He had to answer slowly and carefully. This was very tricky and he didn't want problems before he was prepared for them.<p>"The reason I fought today was because I wanted to test my training. I challenged Kuno today because I was sick and tired of him mistreating Akane. My honor would be worth crap if I was to let Kuno have that stupid fight with Akane daily. He may still continue, but the other people around the school will think twice from now on."<p>"So you would have done that for anyone? It didn't matter if it was me?" came a voice.<p>Ranma didn't turned look at the owner of that new voice that had entered the conversation.<p>"Yes, of course. If it was someone else, especially who could not defend themselves as well you can, then I would have gotten even angrier."<p>He turned around to face her. She was standing there next to the doorway. It looked as if her face had sported an angry looked a moment ago, but right now it was somewhat relaxed.<p>"Ah, I am proud of you, son. You shall make a great husband for Akane."<p>Great, he had to say that. Now starts the natural 'Who would marry that pervert!' deal all over again.<p>Strangely, it had not come. Ranma felt Akane sit down next to him, a little nervous, if relaxed. He actually turned to look at her. She had a slight look of contentment on her face.<p>Ranma realized that what he had said in the morning, had had an effect on her. This was just great. Was she so dense that he had to spell those words out for her to understand? He had gone through so much hell for her.<p>All he had to do was say those words? Who the hell said that actions speak louder than words? It certainly wasn't that words weren't important. He realized they were.<p>Last night, when he told Kasumi he needed her, he noticed that her smile had grown infinitely larger, and more beautiful that it was before, if one could imagine that. He had subtly understood that words did mean a lot. They spent the time yesterday talking about nothing, but much was conveyed. Ranma felt the little things they had talked about that seemed so insignificant at the time but had an enormous impact on the two of them.<p>A good example was the part about Kasumi kneeing in Koryu yesterday and her history with the male population at Furinkan High. Those little things that meant nothing on their own, but they had conveyed so much more. He realized that they opened up with each other and that they enjoyed their time together and did not mind saying what came on their mind. They laughed openly and had already cried openly together.<p>This was what Ranma, after his first real experience with Kasumi, felt real caring should be. This should be the trust between people.<p>To Akane, it was just words. They had spent so much more time together than Ranma and Kasumi. They had also laughed. Ranma didn't remember crying though, but that was before he had almost become insane.<p>It hurt Ranma, now more than ever, thinking that he and Akane had done so much for each other, yet she still needed words.<p>Ranma was sure that Kasumi did not need any words at all to know that he cared for her. Heck, just the look she gave him in the morning was kind and friendly, but it was not just a normal kind and friendly. It was the the kind and friendly look that was meant for him.<p>As all these emotions went through his mind, he was so distracted that he didn't even notice dinner arriving.<p>He ate slowly, trying to find one sort of answer to try and justify Akane's behavior. There had to be one, blaming everything on her would be making him essentially the same as her. She blamed everything on him.<p>Too distracted to even eat, Ranma excused himself early from dinner. Kasumi looked at him curiously. There it was again. It was concern evident in her eyes. He turned to look at Akane who was looking at him with a surprised expression. It too had some amount of concern in it though, Ranma felt.<p>Ranma spontaneously decided to try something new, just to see what will happen. He looked at Kasumi solemnly nodded. She looked at him for a second. He felt as if she understood, They would talk during the time she tutored him.<p>Ranma then turned to Akane, smiled at her, shrugging his shoulders. He just didn't feel like eating much. That had happened often enough with him and Akane that she should understand.<p>Akane only screwed up her eyebrows trying to understand.<br/>"What, what's wrong? Why aren't you eating?" she asked.<p>Ranma sighed. Why did she need words?<p>"Its alright Akane. I just don't feel like eating much."<p>"What, you're not feeling well? When has there ever been a time that you don't eat everything?" Akane asked.<p>"I dunno. It doesn't matter. This has happened before."<p>"When?"<p>"Never mind Akane. Its alright." Ranma just wanted to get out of here.<p>"Can I go to your room then Kasumi?"<p>"Yes Ranma, The door is open. Take your books in with you please. I'll be there shortly."<p>Akane turned to look at her elder sister in complete and utter confusion.<p>"Why is he going to your room with his books?"<p>Okay, now anybody should be able to understand something from that, needing only 'room' and 'books'.<p>Kasumi took a deep breath before answering. "I offered to tutor Ranma because he is doing poorly in school. I did not want him to study with any of you because both of you know that he will, slow you down."<p>"Oh... okay... I guess thats alright."<p>"Akane why do you have to take everything so negatively. You should try and see the positive sides of things. What you said just now was almost accusatory. Are you accusing me of something?" Kasumi dared. She had not dealt with Akane this way for a while. The last time ,it was not too pretty.<p>Akane just sat there in silence.<p>"O-Ofcourse not Kasumi-nee, really sorry if I sounded that way."<br/>Nabiki, purposely, stayed out of the whole affair. She just sat   there watching everything taking place as an innocent bystander<p>Kasumi smiled lovingly at Akane. Akane really was a sweet girl. She just needed some control. Kasumi would now try and help Akane bring that control into her life. She had no control over anything really, except for maybe showing affection to Ranma. It seemed to be changing however, Kasumi had noticed.<p>Ranma slowly got up and took his book bag up to Kasumi's room and sat down in the corner where Koryu slept the night he stayed.<p>He thought of Koryu. 'I wonder what he's doing?' Ranma thought.   He figured, that as Koryu had said, he was probably sleeping.<p>Ranma sat quietly for a long while meditating, waiting for Kasumi to come.<p>He sat there, really tired, really hungry, not knowing what to do when the door opened, revealing Kasumi holding a tray with quite a bit of the remaining food on it.<p>She came in, closed the door with her right foot, walked further in setting the tray of food in front of Ranma.<p>"There" she said, "Now, while you eat, can you explain to me why you left like that?"<p>"What's to explain? This is it. No need to explain with words."<p>Kasumi looked at him with a slightly confused expression. Ranma had started on the food already. She looked at him, eating like its his last meal and started giggling.<p>"Ranma, it might be a good idea to actually chew."<p>Ranma stopped, looked at her, then heeded her advice by slowing down a bit and starting to chew more carefully.<p>Kasumi let her hair loose, pulling up her sleeves, she sat down cross legged infront of Ranma, both her hands together on her ankles.<p>Ranma looked at Kasumi and wondered if there was any time that she did not look  there were those times when she looked sexy, or ...even more sexy, or ...<p>Ranma was shaken out of his stupor by a throat being cleared.<p>He looked at Kasumi.<p>"Well?"<p>So then he began. He told her of what he felt downstairs as he ate the food more slowly. It was kind of hard to explain, but Kasumi interjected a few times, giving Ranma suggestions on how to convey the idea properly.<p>By the time he finished the explanation, he had also finished his food.<p>"So, do ya get it?"<p>"Ranma, What you really want to say is... Akane is ... well slightly insecure and immature. She still needs words, regardless of the feelings. I may be slightly insecure, I wouldn't want to admit that to anyone, but I certainly am not immature." Kasumi explained.<p>"Besides" She continued. "She has been given verbal praise most of her life, by most people. Also the pressures she received from school, you, and the other people makes her need or want words sometimes."<p>Ranma snorted, turning his head away. "Kasumi, I ain't gone through no easy life either. My life has been much worse, but still, even if I agree, can't she stop and think? I mean...I almost killed someone for her. She still believes I killed for her. I changed. I'm being nice. I've been nice to her since we came back. Why can't she change?" he said angrily.<p>After he vented his anger, he realized he had just spoken angrily to Kasumi. He quickly turned towards her and saw her smiling sadly.<p>"Ah... Sorry Kasumi, I should't have spoken like that."<p>"No, Ranma, I understand your feelings. You need to let out your anger, and thats what I'm here for." Kasumi's smile transformed from a sad one to a happy one.<br/>Ranma nodded slowly, for a second he was expecting a retort, but he had momentarily forgoten that this was Kasumi he was talking to, and not some uncute tomboy. Akane's lack of trust in him had hurt him much, and this really was it...Ranma was loosing his patience.<p>"Well,at least now things will be changing. I seriously hope they get better, I ain't got much patience." Ranma said with a smirk.<p>"Yes, I heard what you did today. I am quite pleased." Kasumi said sweetly. The next fifteen minutes were spent by Ranma explaining Kasumi of the entire day's events.<p>She listened to every detail intently.<p>The fight, the school, the Sasuke problem, the encounter with the little lech, she listened to it all. Ranma even explained the sensation and reaction he had when Gusunkugi tried the doll thing again.<p>"Could you give me a bit of time? I'm going to think about how to talk to Sasuke. I do have a strong feeling that you are correct;<br/>Sasuke's knowledge probably not even a problem at all." she said.<p>"Sure, no problem" Ranma replied. "So what didja think?"<p>"I think you had a good day, didn't you?" Kasumi folded her arms, giving Ranma and appraising look with a crooked smile.<p>"Hell yeah!"<p>In his exclamation Ranma viewed Kasumi's gentle outlook, and remembered that Kasumi had something to tell him as well.<p>"Hey, ya said ya got stuff to tell me as well. Come on, don't let me miss out on it!"<p>"I went out with Dr Tofu to lunch today." Kasumi said, a little shyly.<p>Ranma's smile fell a bit.<p>It didn't go unnoticed by Kasumi. Being in one of her rare mischevious moods, Kasumi decided to play with Ranma.<p>"Aw... Is Ranma-kun jealous?" she asked coyly, leaning forward towards him slightly with a wicked smile on her face.<p>"Umm... Kinda... yea"<p>Kasumi stopped and looked at him seriously.<p>"Really?" Kasumi tilted her head to the side.<p>"Well, after a looong time. After all this. I find someone who... ya know... I can trust and you know be really good friends with. Someone I need. Its just a feeling... thats all. It like I'm loosing you right after I got you...but its nothing like I'm not happy for you.I ... really really am very happy for you ... y'know what I mean?"<p>"Firstly, its 'Do you know what I mean?'. Secondly, yes I do. Keep in mind that I have also found you. I can barely talk and think freely with anyone except you. So Ranma, you are not loosing me at all. I will always be there." said Kasumi, taking Ranma's hand in hers. She smiled, trying to provide as much reassurance to the young man in front of her as she could.<p>He had no idea how much his presence meant to her right now.<p>"You know, I was quite depressed when I came home today."<p>"Huh? why?"<p>"Well I..." Kasumi explained every part of her whole day to Ranma, making sure she didn't miss out on Genma's disappearance act.<p>Ranma felt really annoyed when she told him about that. He decided, however to voice his opinions later. He got even more annoyed when she told him about what her father said about her decision to go to ask Dr. Tofu out on lunch.<p>Ranma even kept that in. He had half the mind to go down and dump Mr. Tendo into the koi pond and tell him to wash off his poor sense of honor and dignity that did this to his own daughter.<p>He, did however, laugh really hard when Kasumi told what her counter measures one and two were and how they effectively got Dr Tofu talking sense again, somewhat.<p>Ranma had paid close attention to her words, for it was a rare time when Ranma wasn't thinking about martial arts.<p>He felt glad that she had managed to put things in such a way, so that no one would really mind her getting along better with him, and spending more time together wouldn't seem as a threat to the other fiancees. He currently couldn't care less about the other fiancees. What he was worried about was spending more time with her.<br/>Kasumi haltedly spoke of her date with Doctor Tofu. "I...Well, Ranma, I... I forced him. I felt so desperate. Am I so desperate? Why does he have to treat me like that. I have not seen anyone behave like that before. Its not fair!" She complained.<p>"I - I - Ranma I almost kissed him to get him to try and get him to act properly! I don't want my first kiss like that! Right now I don't even feel if I want to kiss him at all!"<p>A few tears had started collecting in Kasumi's eyes as she started to let out her frustration to the person in front of her.<p>"Aw... Kasumi, don't cry...I... "<p>"No wait, I want you to hear this. I want to cry, I want to let the rest of my frustrations out. Only, if you let me."<br/>Ranma looked at her with a surprised expression. That expression changed to one of simple happiness.<p>"Kasumi, you saved my ass from insanity day before yesterday. I will do anything you ask for. You should already know that."<p>"I do, I just wanted to hear it, actually, no, I wanted to see that look on your face. It helps me relax."<p>Ranma only smiled at that. Kasumi wanted to let some frustrations out. He would love to listen to her. Since last night, he had been captivated by her presence and her attitude. The way she talked, the way she walked, everything she did had this grace to it that he simply could not get out of his mind. He would do anything to know more about her and her feelings.<p>She really cared for him and wanted nothing back in return. That alone was worth his attention. The other feelings, Ranma really couldn't place where or how they really belonged.<p>Ranma waited leaning back into the wall, waiting for Kasumi to continue.<p>"Well... I want to tell you every thing that happened during my high school." and so she began.<p>It took her quite a while explain her feelings and what she thought was not right. She also delved into the enjoyment she had had with her friends. Having them taken away had caused lots of frustration for her. That, along with keeping the entire house running by herself had taken its toll.<p>At the end of the story when she reached the part about Akane, Ranma was quite furious. He couldn't believe it. How could Akane not try to be like Kasumi?<p>The art was not about fighting boys who were doing something stupid like that. Mr. Tendo was also as stupid for not teaching Akane properly.<p>As for Kuno...<p>"I told Kuno that he will regret it if he messes with me again. I was in girl form, and if he doesn't realize... its his tough luck." Ranma said, making no attempt to hid the bitterness in his voice.<p>"Thats fine, if that doesn't work. I will deal with him no matter what Akane says."<p>"You?"<p>"Yes. I have dealt with him before. He never came after me again. Why do you think he rarely ever comes here?"<p>Ranma laughed at that. "You must have made a long lasting  impression." he commented  "Do you want to know?" Kasumi said with a half smile.<br/>"Uh... its ok thanks, I'd rather not. It was probably quite painful."<p>When he said the word 'painful' Ranma looked at the pain in Kasumi's eyes, face, body. She had slowly started shivering. He couldn't bear it. He just couldn't bear watching Kasumi like that. Over the last year, she had never looked like that.   Ranma could relate to the pain that Kasumi was feeling. If one was annoyed the same way every day, that annoyance could be come a real hurt. Ranma thought back to the feelings he had day before yesterday.<p>"I guess both of us are in the same boat, don't ya think? Being treated the same way for a long time. We ain't free do what we want? That no one listens to us?<br/>That we we are both alone?" Ranma smiled gently.<p>Kasumi looked up at Ranma's smile. It was so relaxed. Even though she had felt really bad, she was starting to feel better already. It felt really good to let it out to Ranma.<p>He had, once again, understood her feelings almost instantly. He had even managed to explain it perfectly. She had already come to the conclusion that they had so much in common. He knew her feelings. He could understand them.<p>"Ranma, we have much in common don't we?"<p>"uh... yeah. I guess we kinda do." he said dumbly.<p>Somehow, she found his dumb look kind of cute.<p>Kasumi smiled really wide, showing the true beauty of her charming face as she leaned forward into Ranma's shoulder, putting her arms around his neck.<p>"Thank you for listening to me."<p>Ranma stopped moving for a second. Having a girl put arms around him still called for caution. This had become an instant reflex for Ranma.<br/>"H-Hey, no problem. If you want anything from me. Just ask, besides, why don't we plan some place to go out and do somethin' fun again? We could have a little more fun being away from all this crap."<br/>"Sure Ranma, I have no problem. I know you are still unused to this, but just, just for a bit, can you hold me? I just want to be held by someone I consider a very close friend. God know's I haven't been consoled in a long while. I don't have any other intentions. I just..." she said sleepily.<p>"Nothin' wrong with that Kasumi. Sorry if I like... get all panicky... I get really scared when I'm in this situation."<br/>Kasumi smiled, she would correct his language another day, right now she felt sleepy.<br/>Ranma did the what he felt he could do, provided the current circumstances.<p>Return the favor.<br/>"Ya know," Ranma said thoughtfully. "this is the first time I have ever asked  a girl out."<p>"Really?" Kasumi got back up, looking at him intently.<p>"Hell yeah, this is the first time I asked anyone out without being forced. I mean...I asked you out because I wanna spend time with ya. " Ranma grinned.<p>Kasumi returned his grin with a beaming smile. Ranma could almost feel the beauty radiating from Kasumi as she did so.<p>"Well, you are the fist guy I have said yes to, when asked out on a date. Well, technically the first was Koryu, but that doesn't really count because he was trying to get me to feel better and get out of the house."<p>"What about Dr Tofu?" Ranma asked, quirking an eyebrow.<p>"I asked him, so that doesn't count either." Kasumi said as she leaned into his shoulder again.<p>Ranma put his arms around Kasumi's back and held her close. The very touch of her heated his body. He felt as if he had been drop kicked into a volcano.<p>This had been a good day. No, a great day! He solved one problem, he had managed to get a bit better at Koryu's style. He had spent quite a bit of the day thinking about Kasumi and her amazing personality, barely waiting to come back and tell her about his day.<p>Now she had let herself out to him. She had shared her set of frustrations to him. She trusted him enough to let out her innermost feelings that she had not given to anyone, except maybe a few to Nabiki. Ranma felt as warm as he had felt last night when he saw Kasumi smile and laugh.<p>Kasumi just stayed there, resting her head on his shoulder, maneuvering her body so the whole of her was now leaning on Ranma. Ranma just sat there holding her. Just holding her in his arms felt so right. She was funny, honest, caring, the best cook in the world, and yet she had that scary ( in a good way ) and sexy attitude.<p>"Ranma, I have a favor to ask." Kasumi said in a small voice.<p>Ranma leaned his head back.<p>"What? Ya know I'll do it."<p>"Can you just hold me in your arms for little while longer? I just feel so warm and so relaxed in your hug, I just don't want to let go. I hope you don't mind."<p>"Are ya crazy? Who would mind that?" said Ranma without thinking.<p>Kasumi smiled and held him tighter.<p>Even if she did have had a good day with Dr Tofu, Ranma felt that he didn't want her to leave him. He wanted to spend more time with her, talk more with her, eat more with her, do katas while she stood there and watched, discuss things with her. He stopped his thought process when her words came to his mind. She said she would still be there, no matter what.<p>Then everything was alright. He just needed a close friend. He was sick and tired of being alone.<p>Ranma leaned back deeper into the wall to let Kasumi rest for a while on his right shoulder. She had listened with such interest with what he had to say to her. She laughed at how he treated some of the school guys who were getting a little too annoying.<p>He too, found her whole day's worth of interesting information captivating. He just didn't get tired of listening to her.<p>Ranma felt, right now, in heaven. Kasumi on the other hand was already asleep.<p>She had never felt so safe before. She was warm, surrounded by an aura who's soul existence seemed to be just so it could wrap around her, comfort her, and hold her, protect her.<p>For eternity.<p>Ranma, quite exhausted himself couldn't find it in him to keep his eyes open any longer as he started to drift off himself into deep slumber.<p>They both fell asleep holding each other in a very deep, passionate embrace. After Ranma lost consciousness, his back slipped, sliding along side the wall to rest on the ground.<p>This caused a slightly awkward posture so they both subconsciously re-adjusted themselves to the situation, Kasumi rolled over to the side and dug her forehead in the crook of his neck, both arms still behind it while Ranma snugly re-arranged his arms around her back.<p>It would not be surprising if their hearts were beating at he same time.<p>Neither woke up for the rest of the night. As the night got colder, they only held each other tighter.<p>By around midnight, their bodies were completely entangled, sleeping as soundly as if there was no tomorrow.<p>End Chapter 7
