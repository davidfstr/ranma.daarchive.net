</div>Chapter 9:Akane vs Koryu? / What to do?<p>"So...whatcha think?"<p>"Mmm? About what?"<p>"My performance...your father seemed to be really impressed with me today." Koryu sat cross legged in front of the koi pond, leaning back, his hands spread out behind him, giving him support. Kasumi was sitting next to him, calmly looking at his posture with a mixture of amusement and mirth.<p>"I'd say you did a very good job. Knowing my father, I wouldn't be surprised if he started bawling about finding such a great man for me." She replied with a grin.<p>This revelation caught Koryu unawares, bringing about a questionable   look on his face. "He would so easily get is daughter married off? Will he   not at least try to check up on me? I was being dishonest with him, even   if what I said about myself is the truth, in a way." he commented, then   shrugged it off after a moment. It wasn't like it was going to happen. He   looked towards Kasumi who was currently owning a poignant expression, and narrowed   his eyes slightly.<p>"I am getting older...and since our family follows traditions... it is  sometimes customary to wed the eldest after she comes of age. I suppose father  is so focussed on getting Akane married off to Ranma that he doesn't think about  me. He might also just be afraid that if I leave...no one will take cre of the   house." The brown eyed girl smiled, and wistfully said, "At least I know it   won't be happening any time soon, even though I shouldn't say that..." She played   with her air; it was a clear sign of her hidden personality opening up.<p>"Well...if they were alive, I'd think my parent's wouldn't be so eager to get me married...at least I think so..." stated Koryu, thoughtfully. His father had been a bit of an annoyance at times, but was always afraid of his mom, so even if they were alive, Koryu had a feeling that his dad wouldn't be able to force him into many decisions. Then again, if they were alive, many things wouldn't have happened. Koryu arched back on the grass and let out a deep breath.<p>This off world experience could be considered a good vacation from his usual duties. 'Wow, a blessing in disguise...how rare is that?', he thought privately.<p>"I'm sorry to hear that."<p>"Hmm?" Koryu's thoughts on vacation got derailed.<p>"About your parents." elaborated Kasumi softly.<p>"Nah, its ok. People live to eventually die. Its part of life. Because they died, I had to live a very tough life... and because of that, I have been able to help out lots of people. We can't change what happened, so I just accepted it. Think of it this way, they wouldn't want me to live my life in sorrow for their loss...just like you nor I would want our children to do so if we die early; Its life, so we should live it. We should feel happiness and sorrow, anger, and the whole range of emotions eventually to understand the preciousness of it. Koryu stopped momentarily to regard Kasumi's face, " Ah-sorry, I didn't wan't to go on a philosophical parade."<p>It was very rare that the dark haired man ever really got into such a discussion with anyone...so much that it felt refreshing. 'So this is what a vacation would feel like huh?' Koryu's mind went back to its original mental pattern, only to be derailed again by Kasumi.<p>"No, no it is quite alright. I've read quite a few psychological books, so I understand. We, as in our family, have gone through sorrow and happiness and sometimes a little frustration, but since Ranma arrived, its mostly been one surprise after another. Its rather like a trip to the fun fair that just never ends; the rides never stop."<p>Koryu looked at the delicate yet resilient flower with amusement as he carefully structured his analysis about her. A mischevious smile illustrated his thoughts, when he came to a solid conclusion about the young girl.<p>"So what do you do in your idle time, apart from reading books or cleaning the house, that is," he questioned, his smile widening at her reaction, matching her surprised expression with a knowing one.<p>Kasumi closed her eyes momentarily and smiled meekly, wondering what it  really was that made Koryu smile like a kid in a candy shop. She wasn't sure if   it was because he caught on to her little secret or the fact that he tagged her  slightly obsessive nature on cleanliness. She elected to come out clean; it would  be near impossible for her to figure out what he was thinking.<p>"I train in our family style, whenever I find time, using the Tendo Ryu scrolls. I have been doing so since high school ended, though it is not completely regular. I found it quite enjoyable, actually so I practice whenever I find the time. Its usually during the day, when no one's home." she mumbled quietly, in a slightly guilty voice as if she was caught red handed.<p>Koryu kept on smiling as if he was reading all the thoughts that were going through her head.<p>"I figured as much," the gleeful warrior said.<p>Kasumi folded her arms, cocked her head towards him, "And just how did you figure that out?" she said, trying to stare him down.<p>Koryu matched her stare with an idiotic grin. "Wouldn't you like to know?"<p>The long haired girl was about to reach forward when Koryu swung his legs backwards, creating a 'c' with his current posture, balancing the entire body on his shoulders and head, and pushed out from his back all the way , successfully performing a back flip from his previous lying position, and landed on his feet, his arms outstretched.<p>"Easy there girl...none of that, thank you. I'll tell ya, so just chill, OK?"<p>Appearing slightly downcast at letting her prey go, Kasumi reluctantly leaned back, taking up her previous stature and waited for his explanation.<p>Koryu walked back to his place and sat down, cross legged, again and  spoke up wearily. "You know I am a Ninja right? Well, wherever I go,<br/>its become a habit of mine to take everything in. I just noticed that when  you clean up or pick up something, you do it with grace. That sofa wasn't  very light and you moved it casually, trying to find that cork your father  threw when he took out his wine bottle. Not only that, you inclined your ankles  and the entire body very effectively to make sure you don't exert too much  pressure on your arms. This showed that you do some sort of training and infact,<br/>you are quite strong. Lastly, when you picked up that tray with the jug, glasses,   even with all that weight, you deftly handled it with one hand, angling it as if it was a heavy weapon, walked backwards, turned around and took it back to the kitchen. Anyone else would have been seriously off balance."<p>Kasumi tilted her head to the side. It was a good analysis, but it wasn't enough to be so firm about his conclusion, "But I've been taking care of the house for many years now, by now its become a second nature to me," she argued.<p>Koryu smirked, "You know, there was the TV remote control lying there,<br/>and beside that was a cushion, and before that was a magazine that I threw, and even  before that was the drink that your father spit out by mistake when I explained that I  could not diverge much information because its classified since I work for the government.<br/>You avoided all of those spots, picked up the stuff with grace, back tracked your steps   exactly, and equally gracefully turned around, widening your legs a bit. I've seen   that movement when I sparred with Ranma, its a wide arc twist for quick, balanced turn around."<p>The look on Kasumi's face advised him that she wasn't totally convinced yet,<br/>so he decided to give her the punchline. "Kasumi, I never said I was hundred percent   sure. Just put what I've said, along with the fact that you are the eldest offspring   of a 'martial arts' family. It was only a guess."<p>Kasumi looked at the spikey haired man with some deference and smiled a bit. "I  take it that you put that magazine there just to test me?"<p>"Heh, nah, that was just to see if you really were so nitpicky about keeping the  house clean," said the spikey haired man with a wink.<p>Kasumi sighed after a moment, deciding against hurting Koryu physically, for   the moment. "Yes, I like keeping things clean, Mr. Plucked Chicken." she admitted. It was   probably the easiest way for to get out of Koryu's teasing, and it worked; she saw his   smirk transform into a glum look.<p>"Ah well, so how long do you train?" Mr. Plucked Chicken asked, an estranged  look dangeling on his face.<p>"Well, for strength training and keeping the house clean, I move all the furniture  in the house for dusting, even the beds. If you do that daily, for serveral years, then I  suppose anyone can become quite strong. Also, strength is part of the Tendo Ryu, Anything Goes  style. Then occasionally, as I already said, I train in my room for about an hour or   two." Kasumi explained.<p>"Your room? Umm, not that its too small or something, but why not the dojo?"<p>"Well, father has Akane being the heir to his school. I didn't want to be the   cause of a sibling rivalry. It had given Akane such focus, I didn't want her to feel  threatened for the one thing she had." she elucidated.<p>Her companion sat quitely for a moment emotionlessly, gathering his thoughts,<br/>wondering if he should voice the result of his quick understanding. Deciding to go  for it, the man spoke.<p>"You're afraid you would beat her." It was a statement, not a question.<p>The girl's hair riled up a bit as she immediately refuted the claim. "Oh no, Akane  is much stronger than me, and she has been training a lot more and is quite skilled, and has   been in more fights...and she has much more stamina than I...and...and...she only lacks..."<p>Koryu decided to counter Kasumi's faltered response with silence. After a short while,<br/>she continued.<p>"Control." She mumbled.<p>Her companion didn't do much except close his eyes, fold his arms across his chest   and tap his right hand's index finger on his left arm.<p>"Kasumi-chan," Koryu began gently, "No matter how tough, how skilled, how powerful  one is, if one lacks control over those abilities, then they can easily be defeated. I am  sure you know that, so that is why you trained without the knowledge of the family. I am  assuming Nabiki doesn't know this."<p>Kasumi shook her head at that, "No, she does...I talk to her occaisionally, and she  really has been my link to much of the outside world."<p>"Hmm...for what its worth, I think you made a very good decision." replied Koryu,<br/>bringing Kasumi out of her stupor. "Really?" she asked enthusiastically.<p>"Yeah, you saved her and yourself from needless problems...althought I do think  that if she lost to you, and if she was told explicitly about why she lost, she could  learn a thing or two. Control is mainly the mental ability. She lacks the mental stability  required in martial arts, hell, mental stability is required everywhere in life." commented  Koryu, earning a nod from the girl sitting opposite him.<p>"I told something similar to Ranma this morning, he is as unfocused to anything   else as he is focused on the art. I strongly suggested to him to try and learn to   communicate properly, and do well in his studies. In today's world, as far as I   know, and I do talk to Nabiki so I should be up to date, martial arts might do   well but these aren't the olden times. We cannot get by on nothing but knowledge of   how to fight. We cannot get by on nothing but knowledge of how to fight. We have to   deal with people diplomatically and some sort of university degree must exist to give   people the idea that we are educated. Mr. Saotome seems to think all that is unnecessary."<p>Kasumi wondered why she didn't give Ranma such a detailed explanation as she   gave Koryu. At least Ranma agreed to her and promised to try harder in other aspects of his life. Fights would only be a fraction of his life, and he doesn't know how to deal with the rest of it. Thus the fiancee problem; he doesn't know what to do.<p>The thoughts concerning Ranma occupied Kasumi's mind completely, so she lost  the serious and now bordering dangerous expression that had appreared on Koryu's face.   When she did eventually look at him, she was taken aback with surprise.<p>"Wh-what's wrong?" she asked cautiously.<p>Koryu didn't reply immediately, thinking rapidly on the next course of action, though  upon seeing the slightly panicked expression on Kasumi's face he relaxed a bit.<p>"Its nothing Kasumi...I don't want to interfere with any of your lives...don't  worry about it."<p>"What, about Ranma? Please, don't hold out..." the girl asked, eliciting a sigh from Koryu.<p>"I have a severe dislike for interfering with other people's lives, but   since I have already gotten involved with you, I'll tell ya. There are few things  more dangerous than intelligent 'dumb' fighters. If Ranma is ignorant of anything  apart from martial arts, he will be used constantly by other people. He could end up doing something very wrong, thinking that it is justified, because he was told so. Believe me there are many people who could fool him into almost anything. One has to learn to think before any action. I'm not sure this should be hard for Ranma, because he is extremely perceptive and intelligent when it comes to fighting. He needs only to expand on that. Otherwise, terrible things can happen, if he runs into the wrong crowd."<p>He didn't want to scare Kasumi, but this was the truth. There are  many people, especially in the government, that could have a thousand faces and  would do almost anything to use people like Ranma for their own ends. He knew  there were people on his own world looking for people like him. They'd do anything.<br/>anything for power.<p>"Listen up Kasumi, for now there's no problem because I'm around, and I promise you, while I am here, nothing of the sort will happen, I just suggest that you help him learn that fact. Nerima isn't the only city in the world. There are all different kinds of people, OK?"<p>Koryu accepted a slow nod from the girl, sighing again.<p>"Look, there isn't really that much to worry about anymore,<br/>if the way he looked at me the night I arrived gave any indication, he has begun to  not trust people anymore. In a way that is a good thing, I'd say never trust anyone completely unless you are absolutely sure beyond doubt. Heck, even if Ranma's very strong, I could easily defeat him in hand-to-hand combat by fighting dirty. "<p>"For example, I could fake that he hurt my left arm and continue fighting as if its badly hurt, giving him a false sense of security. When he comes in, confident and leavining an opening, I could slam in a hard punch. By the way, if Ranma's advanced far enough, he might have told you on how I use ki. That simply means, every one of my punches can have a devestating effect, once hit. Hell, even if he survives the blow, he would not try and take advantage of anything even if I WAS hurt, because he wouldn't know if I am faking it or not."<p>Koryu spent the next moments to study Kasumi's face, wondering how she would react to such knowledge. He didn't know why he was really opening up to her, not that he had a black heart or anything. He perfered not to open up to anyone.<p>The less he spoke, the less people knew about him. Kasumi on the the othat hand was a pretty girl, mixed up with a lot of not-so-average people, so there wasn't that much to her that would make him speak so much...apart from her sweetness and her facial similarities to his sister. The only difference Koryu could really find currently was that this woman had an aura of peace; an infinitely calm ocean.<p>The look Kasumi wore had been bordering on anxiety, but seemed to be recovering quite nicely. Apparently, she had noticed more Ranma's pessimistic behavior than Koryu did, which, in his book was a good thing.<p>"Let's get off this shitty topic. Lets see how good you are at fighting." Koryu said, jumping to his feet, altering his posture into a Shao Lin Kung Fu stance. It was the one he had shown the Tendo patriarch in the dojo to demonstrate his martial arts ability while Kasumi was busy cleaning the upper portion of the house, just before lunch.<p>"Eeeeh?" Kasumi's wide eyed, uncharacteristic riposte went lost on the young warrior as he dragged her by her elbow to her feet and prepared for attack.<p>"But...but I can't fight!" She stood, legs wide apart, arms stretched.<p>"Your father is out, and I can sense if anyone is nearby." the ninja   countered. He had decided to treat his current situation like a vacation, god  knows he hasn't had one, ever. Letting out his feelings and general nature might  do him some good after all.<p>"But Ranma and the others will be arriv-" she choked.<p>Not wanting to hear anymore excuses Koryu went straight for her head, putting her in a headlock.<p>"Lets see you get out of this. I'll make it simple." he smirked.<p>Kasumi struggeled for a bit, then decided to push back with her legs while using the momentum to break the hold with her hands. That plan failed miserably as Koryu moved towards the direction she tried pushing into. This being unexpected, made her loose her footing, causing her to slip as she tried to gain some solid ground. She had almost broken free of the hold, only requiring a solid footing.<p>She was about to try and insert a hand to use it as a lever when she  felt a powerful presence behind her. Koryu instinctively loosened his grip  on her when he felt a presence of some people behind him, he had sensed one   of them as a powerful, yet dormant aura that was flickering like a flame being  aggitated by the wind. He'd sensed that aura before, only last time it was   ready to tear him down. Identifying the owner of the aura as Ranma, Koryu decided   not to let go completely. He had to play his part.   'The girl giving off the massive battle aura should be Akane', he   thought privately. It was second nature for him become very serious when powerful  forces of any kind were near.<p>Ranma, Akane and Nabiki just arrived from school. Ranma's hand was a little   sore from all the caligraphy practice he did during the day. The history class that day mentioned that many of the old martial artists practiced caligraphy in order to properly document their secrets. When Ranma looked down at his paper at the time, he was embarrased that he could barely read his own scribbles and resolved to improve his handwriting.<br/>His reverie was broken when he felt Akane burst forth a battle aura. He looked up and saw Koryu gently holding Kasumi in a headlock. Ranma kind of chuckled, it was obvious that Koryu was playing with Kasumi and was trying to see if she could escape a simple hold. It was also obvious that Akane assumed that Koryu was assulting Kasumi.   "WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY SISTER!" Ranma heard Akane bellow as she forward. He saw that her upper body already in a stance and ready to pound the person currently holding her sister in a headlock. Ranma noticed that she made absolutely no effort to measure up her opponent nor his stance, his serious and confident look, or even the fact that he didn't move an inch from his spot.   Akane was going to be beaten badly. He just hoped Koryu didn't embarass her.<p>Koryu heard a faint, "Oops... Bad idea Akane," locating Ranma. He smirked, twisting slightly inwards to the right, shielding Kasumi incase Akane missed her desired target, and blocked Akane's punch with his left elbow.<p>There was a loud 'spath' type noise emitted as Akane's fist ran into Koryu's   flat edge of the elbow. Akane winced a bit at the sharp pain she felt throbbing   through her wrist. Her opponent had blocked her punch completely; it felt like she   was hitting an iron wall.<p>Choosing that moment to speak, Koryu smirked at the younge girl. "Kasumi-chan  and I were having a little spar. I was just checking if she could get out of  a headlock like this." he said amusingly, as if knowing already that his explanation  would offer him no respite.<p>"Yeah, right! She can't fight, who ever you are. What were you planning on doing if she got hurt!"<p>"Jeez relax kid, I was just fooling around with her. There's nothing wrong  with playing with a girl, is there?" Koryu understood her feelings, but his current  explanation should be able to mollify a good amount of people. The impression he had of her from Kasumi was that she was an extremely sweet girl who was just a little too protective of her family and friends, apart from the nasty side she adopted because of her attitude towards the other sex if she got annoyed.<p>"PLAYING? Playing with her! How dare you!" The enraged Tendo girl lashed out  with a wicked right foot side kick. Koryu narrowed his eyes slighly, letting go of Kasumi  and pushing her to the side.<p>When Ranma had seen Akane continue to attack, Ranma had run forward, not bothering  to bother 'thinking' of Kasumi's safety when Akane was on a rampage. He was already there   to grab her gently as she hit him while trying to talk to Akane.<p>"Akane, he's telling the truth. Its alright!" Kasumi panicked, in Ranma's protective arms.<p>It was too late, Akane had already attacked.<p>Koryu slid his left leg back slightly, edging his right hand forwards and struck   Akane's ankle from the side with his palm, effectively pushing it away from its intended   target. He then snaked his left hand around the foot instantly securing it from  further movement. He supported his snake hold with his right hand, even if it really  wasn't needed; Koryu didn't want to give her a good idea of his strength.<p>The Tendo heir tried to jump and perform a swerving kick with her remaining  left leg aiming for the opponent's head, but failed as he leaned back, keeping his hands  in the same place as if fastened there by steel bars. She expected her leg's strength  and the momentum to help twist her foot out of his hold, but this idea was just as   painful as the punch was. She landed with a thump with a slight cry in pain.<p>Ranma instinctively reached forward to stop the fight but was held back by  Kasumi. The look she gave him reminded him of the morning's conversation. He decided  to stay back for once.<p>Nabiki stood there wide eyed, trying to process the current events as fast  as possible. She walked in seeing Kasumi in a headlock by a pretty cute guy...well not  really cute but he was good looking. Then she hears Ranma say something about it being a bad idea to himself when Akane charged forward, only to be put down. Most astonishing of all, Ranma had not helped out in the fight.<p>'What's happening?' wondered the Furinkan Ice Queen. She was far from worried  though. Ranma's calm outlook on the situation was enough for her to know everything was   alright. This was most probably Koryu, and as he said, they were playing around. It   sounded pleasant because Nabiki couldn't remember the last time Kasumi did something   to just play around, besides she had a feeling that Kasumi was quite a capable fighter, even if she lacked experience.<p>Her thoughts were stopped in middrift, as she heard who she suspected was Koryu speak up.<p>"Good stance, nice attempt. Next time, be a little wary of your opponents posture, attitude and strength. If it is a guy, he might be stronger than you as generally, they are. Lastly, check if there really is a reason to fight before you go into one. If you had simply asked me to let go of your sister, I would have complied, and what's wrong with playing with a girl? You make it sound as if its a bad thing." Koryu mused, letting go of Akane's foot to stand back.<p>"You don't play with girls! Especially not like that with Kasumi!"<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, 'Here we go again, well at least, she has better ground this time for that accusation. 'Playing' with a girl does sound a bit...but then again I dunno,' he thought.<p>"I'm a friend of Kasumi-chan...hell, even if I did something perverted, as long as she didn't take offence its alright." Koryu tried to reason with the girl. Fine, maybe he should have been a little bit more careful with the choice of words he used.<p>"You WILL NOT!" Akane said getting up, wincing slightly at the pain in her right ankle.<p>"Akane-chan, this is my friend Koryu. As he said, we were just fooling around. There's no reason to be alarmed." said Kasumi while smoothing out her clothes, receiving an incredulous look from Akane.<p>"BUT...BUT He-"<p>"On that note, I do think it is very commendable that you acted the way you did. It shows you have a great deal of love and care for your sister. You just need to elaborate slightly in the methodology you employ to sort out the situation." Koryu smiled. Maybe complimenting her and speaking in a sophisticated manner might distract the girl enough to calm her down.<p>Akane looked from one to the other, trying to understand. "What's going on?"<br/>"Its just as we explained." Kasumi said sweetly, slightly red in the face. The next few moments Kasumi used very effectively telling Akane what happened during the day and how Koryu decided to stay the day with her and Mr Tendo, leaving out some specifics.<p>Nabiki stood behind the group of people, doing what she did best, analysing the situation. Though she kind of find it quite hilarious that Akane was brought down to reality by a very Ranma-like person, only this man was quite intelligent.<p>She held back a smile threatening to form on her lips, emagining what Akane's behavior would be like after she was beaten by simple blocks. This man would be as strong as Ryoga to be able to do that. His confidence and graceful movements showed skill.   Nabiki couldn't exactly gauge Ranma's true skill and strength after his arrival from China, but she couldn't help arriving at a conclusion that this man could easily be as powerful as Ranma, minus the special attacks.<p>In the mean time, Koryu and Ranma talked idly, Nibiki barely listening, about the whole day as Ranma grudgingly told about his 'horrors' as he was chased by Kuno, got ki drained by Ms. Hinako, and spent half the time a girl.<p>Koryu snickered at Ranma's expense and seemed to have no intention to stop when Ranma gave him a stare even Nabiki wouldn't want directed at her.<p>After Kasumi had carefully explained the circumstances of her predicament  to her over protective younger sibling, she turned to look at the rest of the crew.<br/>"Oh my, the dinner! Its ready, Nabiki, Akane, you should change and get ready." she  said, slightly alarmed.<br/>The situation had been successfully disolved as the girls moved in to change and have dinner. Koryu, Ranma and Kasumi stayed outside.<p>Before Akane went in, she gave Koryu a death stare. "Don't you dare do anything perverted to my sister." she threatened through the doorway of the house.<p>This confused Koryu, fine, at times if the other person objected, then it was very impolite and quite disurbing to behave in such a way. Even though Akane had been explained that everything was alright... why was she so narrow minded, given the fact of the problems at school. Was she so childish that she figured everyone in the world had the same mentality as the kids at school? Well, she wasn't really that far off, he thought candidly.<p>Getting an idea, he decided to 'play' with Akane's head a little bit.<p>"You mean, like this?" he asked innocently, slapping Kasumi's butt, educing a yelp from the hapless girl.<p>Ranma frowned a bit at that, but made no movement. Kasumi was blushing,<br/>holding in an intense desire to smack Koryu upside the head for that. She decided  for better or worse, to get him another way. She unclenched her fists and smiled playfully, "Koryu!" she said, mock admonishingly.<p>"Why you! How dare you?" Akane asked in indignation, as if she had her butt slapped.<p>"What's wrong with that? You don't ever want any guy to do anything pervert to you?" Koryu asked as innocently as a if suddenly he had aged back 15 years.<p>"Of course NOT! Opologize to my sister!"<p>"So you don't like guys."<p>"I don't like BOYS!"<p>"I'm not a boy, I'm a man...21 years old...but thats besides the point. So   you don't mind girls?"<p>"No! Girls aren't perverted like boys, and they behave better, NOW OPOLOGIZE!"<p>Koryu snickered... this girl needed to wake up. Women could be pretty much as  sick as the men on many occasions.<p>"What's funny? I said opologize to my sister." the hot tempered Tendo grated out.<p>"Its ok, Akane, Koryu was just fooling around. Its alright" Kasumi soothed.<p>"Kasumi?" Akane looked aghast at her elder sister, while Nabiki stood there  quietly, knowing that Koryu was reading Akane like a book and playing with her  mind. 'He's not bad. It looks like I'll have to be careful in trying to get some  money out of him.' she thought. A snap of fingers brought everyone's attention back to Koryu.<p>"Lemme guess, you're a lesbian, right?" Koryu pronounced, as though he'd just solved a complicated puzzle.<p>Ranma nearly snickered as Akane momentarily lost speech.<p>"I-I AM NOT! What makes you say that?" Akane finally managed.<p>"Well look, you don't like boys, and you like girls. Its simple as   that. You think a simple gesture is perverted. May I remind you that married  couple in the entire world must do perverted things, if they didn't then, lets just  say world population would decrease rapidly...wouldn't it?" Koryu laughed good heartedly.<p>"Thats different!" Akane began only to be cut off immediately.<p>"Oh...so being married makes anything less perverted? If they openly behaved in such a way in public, it would be just as perverted. You need to relax, not everyone in the world is a bad person Akane. Kasumi and I are good friends. Don't you think that if I had any bad intentions, I would have been able to do whatever I want in the last few hours, since that's how long your father has been gone?"<p>Whatever counter Akane had in her mind, died in her mouth after that  relevation. She tried to come up with a rebuttal, but what he said was right, and   Kasumi was nodding with him. This was wrong, it wasn't like Kasumi, but then again  Akane had never seen how Kasumi behaves with her friends. Maybe, maybe she had been   a little too hasty, but that didn't mean she had to admit it. She would to Kasumi,   but she would never admit it to this man in front of her.<p>He reminded her too much of Ranma, which ever way she looked at him. The only  thing he had going for him was that he was intelligent, and it showed the way he  spoke. Otherwise, his proud, almost arrogant posture as if he is so sure of himself  only made her angrier.<p>She would fight him again, and beat him, when her ankle and hand had healed.<p>The Tendo heir turned around and stomped into the house without looking back.<p>"Umm... was that necessary?" asked Ranma folding his arms,having a sneeky feeling that he would be on the receiving end of Akane's anger now.<p>"I don't take shit from anyone...besides, I didn't see you complaining." replied   Koryu, amusement clearly evident in his voice.<p>"She needs to grow up." replied the pig tailed martial artist.<p>"You boys stay here, I'll be right back." said Kasumi gently before heading  into the house.<p>Both Koryu and Ranma looked at each other.<p>"Huh?" whispered Ranma to Koryu, who remained quiet, but possessed a look that illustrated Ranma's question.<p>"Hey, ya want to spar?" asked Ranma after a moment's silence.<p>Koryu thought about it for a moment, "Sure, why not? I'll only use Shao Lin though, 'cause that's the only style I'm willing to let anyone else see." mutterred the ninja, loosly getting into his stance.<p>Ranma nodded, throwing his bag to the side and getting into his own traditional stance. He didn't have much else to do for the rest of the day, and his mother's presence with his father had been a burden on his mind. He needed something to help him feel refreshed.<p>Homework could wait for a while.<p>It didn't take long for the two opponents to initiate the attack. Having  already fought once, they were quick to meet each other again in the middle  of powerful blows. Ranma had opted for a mid air attack, as it was  his speciality, sending his his right foot instensly towards his advesary's head. Just as he leaped, he noticed something different about Koryu's stance. It was lower to the ground and his hands weren't as far outstreached. Figuring the best way to see it was to meet it head on, Ranma didn't reduce the intensity of his attack.<p>Koryu met him head on with a mid-air round house kick, making Ranma's   eye's widen in surprise. That wasn't Shao Lin! Their kicks met heavily, dispersing  the air the moment they struck. Neither got hurt as the attacks were nullified,<br/>leaving Ranma a little proud that he had managed to level up to Koryu slightly in the   past few days of constant training. He was however, left compeletly out of balance  because he was expecting a different sort of attack. As he rightened himself, Koryu   took the opportunity to do a 360 in midair and send the same foot towards Ranma's gut  from the other side.<p>Having seen the attack, Ranma setup a strong guard. He knew the kick would  reach him before he met the ground for a solid footing; the kick was coming  in too fast to be dodged completely. Undeterred by the situation he angled his body  as much as he good to evade the blow that would be arriving within a split second  and let his guard take the blow. Unfortunately, absorbing the blow put Ranma completely  off balance.<p>Knowing Koryu, he had to be careful because each tag could seriously hurt.<br/>He didn't want to get hurt so quickly in the fight. The kick impacted on Ranma's  side guard as he was inches from the ground, sending him sliding back as he had somehow  managed to prevent himself from tumbling. He used that momentum to roll back while   sliding and land on one foot while grinding his other knee into the ground in hopes   of stopping his backward slide.<p>Koryu completed a swirl in mid air after his kick to Ranma, which had been expertly blocked, and landed gracefully on his feet, facing Ranma. He noticed that the Saotome heir had amazingly recovered from the bad landing.<p>'Damn, I gotta hand it to him. He's got some wicked reflexes. Looks like even if I wanted to finish him off instantly, I wouldn't be able to unless I fought full out,' he thought. Ranma had only begun to get a grasp on full momentum based fighting, constantly staying on the edge.<p>Annoying.<p>Koryu smirked, watching Ranma come to a grinding halt,'Looks like I found another annoying fighter. Maybe I should offer him to come to my world and join my force. He'd be an amazing asset, though the thought of someone else who could easily match my fighting abilities isn't all that pleasing. Che, lets not think about that until I am in a condition to go home.   It could take a while.' he thought sourly.<p>Another attack came to an abrubt halt when Kory saw Kasumi walk out   of the house and decided to ease down for the moment, he had already seen Ranma's   growth in the last few days; he had already made his assessment.<p>It was remarkable, regardless of the fact that he still had some way to go. There were some human limitations...and he was no exception, but if he trained his spiritual power well enough, he could be a force to be reckoned with in the time span of a few months.<p>"I can't leave you two for a moment, can I?" inquired the senior Tendo daughter with a frown, looking in between the two fighters.<p>"Aww come on Kasumi, we were just sparring," explained Ranma, "Nothin bad happened."<p>Both warriors, started walking towards the girl, wondering why she was wearing an evening dress; a very nice evening dress. She was looking quite beautiful, in fact.<p>"Going out?" Koryu inquired.<p>"Why Koryu, how could you forget?" Kasumi gave a mock hurt expression, to which Koryu only raised an eyebrow. 'I don't like this,' went through his mind.<p>"You invited me out to the Golden Dragon for dinner."<p>"I did?"<p>"Oh, don't play like that. I even asked Nabiki to borrow this evening dress,   so how do I look?" Kasumi did a little twirl.<p>"I think you look simply marvelous, Kasumi." came Nabiki's voice from the doorway.<p>"Why thank you, Nabiki." Kasumi beamed at her younger sister, who was wearing a mischevious smirk, before turning to the other two young men.<p>"Yeah, you look quite elegant," grunted Koryu, imagining the price tag on the dinner he had gotten dragooned into paying for. He should have expected something. Being caught off gaurd was one of the things he really had a distaste for.<p>"Wow," was the only thing Ranma could say, trying to figure out how beautiful Kasumi could look in a nice evening wear. It was a sleeveless silver dress going down to her knees. She was wearing matching silver sandles and her hair were kept open.<p>Since it was rare that she got any, Kasumi felt as light as a feather upon hearing the compliments. She let out a deep breath and turned back towards Nabiki. "The food is all ready, and when father comes back, please heat it up for him. alright?"<p>"Yes, yes, sure. You go have a good time Kasumi. Where is father anyways?" replied the middle Tendo.<p>"Umm, he just told me he had some business to attend to in the city and  would arrive back a little soon...ah... there he is...welcome back father." Kasumi  announced, noticing Mr. Tendo walking into the Tendo compound.<br/>"Thank you Kasumi," Sound Tendo smiled back at his daughter from the gate, "oh, you look like you are going out somewhere. You are looking very beautiful. I suppose this fine young man here couldn't help but ask you out again, could he?"<p>"Couldn't help at all," Koryu mutterred dryly, with a smile which fooled fooled no one but the Tendo patriarch, bowing in respect.<p>"Oh thats great! I hope you take good care of my daughter, Koryu."<p>Ranma looked at the scene playing out in front of him with slight awkwardness. He didn't know what he was feeling. Just one thing was certain, he wanted to go along.<p>As if reading his thoughts, Kasumi turned around to Ranma, "Not only me, father, Koryu invited Ranma as well. They had enjoyed themseves a lot the last time we went out."<p>Koryu started sweating, having heard about Ranma's appetite from Kasumi.<br/>Taking him to one of the most expensive resturants in the city would effectively   make a big hole in his pocket. It wasn't that he had money problems; he just   didn't wish to use it all up immediately for he could be stuck without a way home   for a while.<p>An idea clicked in Soun's head, lighting his head up like a Christmas tree.<br/>"Oh that would be a great idea! Maybe Akane can go as well. It could be a brilliant  double date!"<p>"Sorry dad, no-can-do. Akane twisted her ankle fighting wonder boy over  there." Nabiki thumbed towards Koryu, "She got angry when he and Kasumi were practicing   escape holds or something" the mischevious glint in her eye still there.<p>Soun smiled, "You got Kasumi to spar with you?" giving Koryu another upraising look.<p>"Uh, yeah... Akane came and mistook the situation for something else. She attacked me, forcing me into defense. It seems she didn't attempt to estimate my abilities and therefore hurt herself."<p>"Hmm, I see. Too bad then. Well, I hope you can have a great time then." The  middle aged man masked his immense surprise by turning around. It was very unexpected   to hear that his eldest daughter tried to spar; she hadn't done so for a long time. 'Oh  my dear wife would be happy' he thought, walking back into his house.<p>"Yes sir," Koryu again bowed respectfully towards Soun's retreating form, "We should be back in a few hours."<p>"Uh...So I'm coming?" Ranma asked, slightly oblivious to what was happening;<br/>he had been wondering where the Tendo patriarch had been. A sneaky feeling that Mr Tendo had just returned from a visit to his old man was itching him.<p>"If you want to..." Koryu smirked.<p>"Uh...yeah, could ya wait for a moment so I could get changed then? I don't  wanna go like this when you guys are like dressed up nice."<p>Kasumi smiled at Ranma, "Sure Ranma, we'll be waiting at the gate," she pointed towards the exit of the Tendo compound.<p>"Gotcha." Ranma jumped to his room window.<p>The moment he left, Kasumi's smile turned into a slight frown. "I do suppose it's going to take some time..." she mutterred, displeasure at Ranma's rough, slang-ish talking habits coloring her mind.<p>Nabiki started walking towards Koryu, smiling, and held out her hand, "Nice   to meet you, I'm Nabiki." So far her plan had worked fine. The best way to figure   out a person was to see how they react when problems were put on them. Koryu    had managed to handle Ranma's inclusion with no problems, nor nor were there any    issue with her father's happy face when he heard about Koryu sparring with his eldest daughter. She was hoping that he would start weeping right then and there...she needed to check up on that.<br/>It would be interesting to see Koryu react to the Tendo water truck.<br/>Said man didn't take long to assess her look, as he too held out his hand. Her   hands were delicate, soft, yet had this inner strength to them, informing   the ninja that the girl did some form of strength training. 'Heh, the kid's trying   to assess me. Well, I guess she can do whatever she wants...' he thought carelessly.<br/>"Pleasure. Its nice to put a face to the person I've heard so much about." Koryu smiled politely. That ought to put the girl on the little defensive. It seemed to have worked when he saw the ever so slight quiver in the girl's smile as she continued to shake his hand for a moment longer.<br/>Nabiki let his hand go quickly after his reply, making a mental note to talk   to her dearest elder sister about how much she had told this man. "Well, I hope it was   nothing bad. Sorry,as much as I'd love to chat, I got to go do some homework; I am in    my senior year you know." She turned around to walk back.       This guy was smart, unlike most of the people here. It would be unwise to    talk to him without knowing before hand what he had learned from Kasumi. She smiled    sweetly, "Have a nice day, " turning around to wave one last time before heading    back into the house.       'Well, that oughta keep her off my back for a short while. Smart girl though,<br/>very smart.' though Koryu. He didn't mind meeting the family, but he hoped to keep   contact with the others as minimum as possible. More contact would lead to complications.<br/>"Thanks for not going so easy on Akane. If she wants to be a good martial   artist, she has to learn the hard way that she needs more training." Kasumi smiled   sadly.<br/>"Hmm, let me guess. She has been treated like a little princess."<br/>"Sort of."<br/>"I don't like hitting girls, but I decided to let her realise her flaws. She   needs more experience in analysing her foes." Koryu crossed his arms, slowly making   his way to the gate. "And she ain't the only one, ne Ranma?" he said rather loudly.<br/>Kasumi leaned away slightly, wondering why Kory spoke loudly. Upon hearing   'Ranma', she turned to see the said person standing behind them with a slight frown   on his face, wearing slightly semi-formal clothes.<br/>"I thought you weren't going to get involved anymore?" he asked.<br/>"Sasuke's knowledge is my fault, so I will do what I can to deal with it. Also,<br/>I have decided to pretend this is a vacation. I'm going to enjoy myself whenever I can.<br/>It might end up doing me some good. I don't like the idea of staying serious all the   time. It's quite annoying." muttered Koryu, not nowing exactly where Ranma was getting fuel for his distress from.<br/>"Heh, Anyways you said you would only use Shao Lin!" Ranma complained, coming up to the two people.<br/>"Dude, haven't you learned enough about tricks and lies? From your history,<br/>you shouldn't trust anyone...present company exluded ofcourse.." Koryu winked.<br/>"I didn't expect you to though..."<br/>"Hah! I'm a Ninja, thats what I do. I fight dirty." Koryu grinned.<br/>"sigh Whatever man, so where's this Golden Dragon place we're going?" Ranma had worn the new pants with the teal, chinese silk shirt he wore occasionally, tucking it in. He had hoped he looked acceptable enough. Kasumi was looking stunning and Koryu was wearing all black pants and a full buttoned up black shirt. He looked kinda cool.<br/>"Its in the heart of Tokyo, its one of the most expensive resturants in the city... Money don't grow on trees Kasumi-chan" The ninja growled out, giving the girl an annoyed look.<br/>"Neither does it grow on my back-side...Koryu-chan," was the tart reply.<br/>"Oh...you mean this?" Koryu reach forward to grab her butt again but found his arm stopped by a cold,strong grip. Kasumi cought her 'attacker's' wrist, immediately twisting the fingers. When she found Koryu slightly wincing, she pushed hard,pivoting on her left foot,bringing her arms over her head. When she completed the motion, she was facing his back, holding Koryu's wrist, his arm stretched back in an ackward position.<br/>Ranma stood there, stunned as Kasumi performed an advanced hold on Koryu flawlessly. "Wow...I didn't know you could do stuff like that."<br/>"I do know how to defend myself. Now Koryu-chan, unless you want your arm dislocated, I suggest you not try anything of the sort again," Kasumi smiled gently, speaking as though she was offering him some refreshments.<br/>"Heh, so this is your skill huh? This is a slightly brutal lock, Kasumi-chan." Koryu laughed, "Not bad. If you and Akane had switched places this morning, you would have managed to do more than she did. Heck, you could even break my elbow right now if you know how."<br/>Kasumi's cheekes reddened a bit in embarrasment, "She just doesn't think well when she's angry."<br/>"Your point?" Koryu relaxed his arm to get the feel back in them. She had managed to block his blood flow at the same time. Looks like the girl knew the theory of blocks really well, and knew how to implement it.<br/>Kasumi couldn't think of a reply, so she let go in hopes for dropping the subject. Koryu chuckled, "Relax girl, we're going out to have fun. Get yourself in gear."<br/>Calmly the, the three walked out of the Tendo house, each wondering what would happen tonight.<br/>Back inside the Tendo house, Nabiki walked into pretty typical sight; her father bawling his eyes out. 'He must have held it in, after hearing how Kasumi tried sparring today...even if that does sound a little far fetched'<br/>"Dad, please stop crying...can you tell me anything about this friend of Kasumi?"<br/>Soun stopped bawling for the moment too look at his middle daughter, tears still streaking down his face, striking a noble pose.<br/>"He is a most honorable, respectable man."<br/>"Is he now? I take it you asked him where he's from?    What he does?"<br/>"He works for the government, and because of his position he was not at liberty to say where he comes from or what he does exactly. He is a very powerful martial artist as well. He performed an excellent Shao Lin demostration today. His speech was so refined, he is definately a man for my dear Kasumi. I can hardly believe he got her to revitalise her interest in the family art! He is truly worthy."<br/>'Its not like her interest in the art was lost, dad, but I will let that slide for now. Too many unknowns. If he is truly what he says he is, I doubt even I will be able to get info on him...well I could always try expanding my contacts...might as well start now.' Nabiki thought.<br/>"That sounds very nice dad, I got to go do some work so I'll see you later. Also I think I might have to take Akane to see Dr Tofu."<br/>"Was Akane hurt that bad?"<br/>"She was limping, and couldn't use her wrist. I'd say she hurt herself bad enough."<br/>"He cheated!" came a loud, irritated voice from the stairway.<br/>"Oh...and how did you deduce that?" Nabiki mused, turning to look at her younger sister.<br/>"Come on, Nabiki. I punched him very hard, I doubt even Ryoga could have blocked that without moving an inch."<br/>"Have you ever thought that there could be people who are better martial artists than Ryoga? He's a man, Akane, and apparently he works for the government. He could be an even better martial artist than Ranma for all we know. They were sparring before Kasumi went out to greet them. From the results, it seems like it was pretty even fight."<br/>"Well, in any case, I think it is a good thing then, Ranma will become even stronger and when our school is finally united, we shall have an even stronger bloodline. The Tendo and Saotome names will be well known," The water show repeated itself, as Soun Tendo started day dreaming again.<br/>"sigh We don't know about that." muttered Nabiki under her breath, turning around to take Akane to the doc's.<br/>"That baka, he didn't even help me..." grated Akane, who was still in a foul mood having no outlet for frustrations, chose her favorite.<p>"Oh... and if he did, then you would have gotten angry at him for not treating you like a martial artist. You really need to think Akane." chided the middle Tendo daughter.<p>"But-but...oh alright, maybe I didn't think, but come on, I am sure even you were shocked...stuff like that doesn't happen a lot.."<br/>"Yes, this once you're right. I looked at Ranma and saw his calm expression. I figured if he was calm about this, then Kasumi wasn't in any danger. I trusted him." Nabiki moved to the door, putting on her shoes.       "You trusted him?" The younger girl followed her, limping away but her anger had her temporarily forger the physical pain.<br/>"Has he ever proven not to be trustworthy whenever there was trouble? Akane, think will you? Come on, we should be heading towards the doc's. I have home work to do tonight so lets go."       With the slightly urgent look on Nabiki's face, Akane gave in for the moment. She did want to know just how bad her injuries were.       Sliding her arm around her sister's waist, Nabiki put Akane's arm around he shoulders to help remove the weight from hurt leg, then she slowly half dragged her sister to the doctor's office.       When they arrived at Dr Tofu's, he was more than surprised to learn the cause of the injuries rather than the injuries themselves. They were sprains, though he did ask wether Akane had punched an iron wall. "It sure felt like it," was the reply.<br/>Dr Tofu didn't know what to say to that, so he tried to ascertain as much information on the stance of the opponent as he could such as his height, bulk stance. After making sure there was nothing more that could be extracted by asking the girls, he thought about how that man could have blocked so well.<br/>"It seems he must have used a ki reinforcement. That's quite an advanced level if he managed to not move at all from his place when Akane punched him so hard. It seems that he is more skilled than Ranma in this degree." he muttered thoughtfully.<br/>"Uh-excuse me...did you say he's better than Ranma?<br/>How can you tell that?"<br/>"Oh-oh nevermind about that. Channeling ki and manipulating it are two different things, and remember how powerful Ranma is. Skill is definately needed in fights, but its the balance of power and skill that is most important. Ranma has that more than anyone here...unless you want to include Elder Cologne or Happosai," Ono Tofu smiled. "Why were you two fighting anyways. From what I can deduce, you weren't attacking Ranma, so it was either he did something to you personally or was trying to hurt Ka-ka-Kasumi."       Nabiki and Akane had nothing in mind to comment on their first time experience of having their jaws hit the floor. Dr Tofu had said the Taboo word, albeit haltedly, without cutting a rug with his 'Betty-chan'.       "Wha-how?" Akane tried to register her astonishment.<br/>"Oh, you're wondering about my condition? Kasumi and I went out for lunch yesterday. She kind of forced me to get over my strange behavior in her presence, anyways we had a great time...oh but please forget about that. So please, tell me how you got into a fight with this man."<p>The question brought Akane out of her astonished state as she tried to relate what happened to her doctor, before Nabiki could interject. Throughout the entire explanation and that additional information about Koryu, Ranma, and Kasumi going over to have dinner Tofu kept a straight face, nodding a few times.<p>"So...I do hope she enjoys herself today then..." he said at last, causing Akane to gasp slightly, and Nabiki's mind to come out of her batch processing mode. Nabiki clicked her tongue angrily at her lack of control. Akane, on the other hand looked ashamed for her lack of tact in front of the good Doctor.<p>Whatever the case, Nabiki tried to repair whatever damage Akane could have done. Has the girl stopped thinking? As much as Nabiki wanted to blame her, she knew she couldn't. Akane was under a lot of pressure at home...all those problems...person seem slightly 'out of their mind' on occasion.<p>"They're old friends, and apparently Koryu is on vacation so he came to say hi to her. It seems he got along with Ranma quite well. I suppose it would be impolite to have only him go so Kasumi went along with Koryu." She knew she was twisting the truth more than usual, but at least a slight improvement could prove to be helpful.<p>The doctor looked thoughtful for a moment, "Ranma, getting along with someone who is not a fiancee? Maybe this is a new adventure, don't you think? But I suppose its a good thing. If its Kasumi's friend then there should be no problems."<p>That peeved off Akane, "There are problems! He is an arrogant jerk! He even behaved irrisponsibly with Kasumi-nee. He- he slapped her back side!"<p>If Tofu felt anything, he didn't show it. He just smiled, knowing Akane's attitude, "And how did she respond?"<p>"She blushed! But then she said it was ...alright...why? She's too good for her own good! Now she's gone out with Ranma and that jerk!"<p>"Akane, can we save the banter for later please? Kasumi's a big girl, she can handle herself. Don't start making decisions for her. Whatever she chooses to do, its her choice. You can't barge in on her private life like that." said Nabiki.<p>"She's right you know Akane, K-Kasumi is a grown up girl. Even if she is very sweet, should she really did object to a specific behaviour then I am sure she would say so openly. Anyways, for now I suggest that you try and stay off that foot. I would recommend some crutches but I don't think you would take them would you?" Dr Tofu tilted his head in question.<p>Upon receiving a heavy shake of her head in reply he sighed, "Ok...it's good you didn't damage your writing hand...but please do not try to abuse your limbs. You will need at least one week to try and heal. It would take sooner, given that its you but this sprain was a little to the hard side... alright?"<p>"Yes Doctor. Thank you."<p>"Thanks Doc, Akane, can you wait outside for me, I'd like to talk to Dr Tofu for a minute. Sorry, but just for a few minutes." Nabiki said sweetly, eliciting a blank look from the younger girl.<p>"Um..OK, I'll be outside." Akane said, walking outside, closing the door behind her.<p>Tofu looked at Nabiki for a moment in silence, imagining what the young girl could want to talk to him about. She had apparently never gotten hurt much, thus she had seldom visited his office.<p>Silence ensued for a short while as Nabiki quickly   re-arranged her mind to put things in order. Too many things  were happening within a very short period of time. They were all different, though they might be interlinked. Kasumi's behavior, Ranma's attitude, and this Koryu person.<p>Finding out Kasumi went out with Dr Tofu was the last straw. It wasn't that she wanted to cause any problems, she just needed to know exactly what was happening so she could predict what could happen next. It was how she had kept herself going so far.<p>Deciding that her reasoning was perfect, Nabiki crossed her arms and smiled, tapping her foot slightly in an impatient fashion. "Come on Doctor, you have to fill me in on what happened. I'm sure you know me well enough. I'm really happy for you two, and I really wouldn't mind doing anything to help thing along. My sister has been cooped up in the house for too long."<p>Dr Tofu sighed, smiling a little..."Well it   started off quite painfully...as she came in and-"<p>Akane waited outside impatiently, resting on the sofa. Nabiki had stated that she would be done in five minutes, yet it had taken fifteen already. Not that that was a bad thing, it had definately given her the time to think upon her actions and what had happened this evening. Maybe Koryu was like Tofu...only he behaved like an immature brat at times.<p>They had all been immature at times...Toma and Kirin. They weren't bad people though. But they didn't behave like he did. Kasumi hadn't objected, and even if Akane wanted to, she could not decide the friends Kasumi should have or not.<p>It was surprising though that Kasumi, who had always been like a saint was being friendly with a person like Koryu. Maybe she knew something about him that no one else did. He seemed to also have gotten along very well with Ranma.<p>But what about Dr Tofu?<p>Wasn't Kasumi two timing him now? How could Kasumi do that? Is that what is called two timing? Maybe not, because Akane had herself gone out with Ryoga and she only viewed of him as a good friend. He is so much more different than the other people.<p>Could he be immature at times as well? Akane gave short laugh in response to that thought.   No way, he was such a sweet  at all like Ranma. If Ranma could just be a little more sensitive. Would it kill him to behave nice? Why couldn't he just push away the other fiancees. She was sick and tired for competing for him.<p>Didn't he understand that? Why couldn't he just give her that peace of mind.<p>She was sure Kasumi had made the distinction between friends and ...well, whatever. Akane felt confused. She needed to sort out her feelings as well. She knew she really liked Ranma, she would never tell him.<p>It was so embarrasing. The moment any news got out about about her feelings, either there would be fights or weddings. A fleeting thought gave Akane the shuddering thought of both.<p>Just like the failed wedding.<p>It would just give him way too much ego boost. His slightly deflated attitude was growing on her. "Pfffft...who cares about boys anyways? I'm only in high school. I don't want to get married before going to college." Heck, she wasn't sure what she wanted to study!<p>Leaning further back in the sofa, the Tendo heir let out a long sigh. The last 15 minutes had not helped her much in finding answers. She did have more questions though.<p>One thing was certain however. She wasn't really annoyed about perverts...She was just extremely ticked off at the attitude and behavior of some people. It really proved the point that boys could be so immature about other peoples feelings.<p>Maybe she could talk to someone who would help her out. Yeah! She could talk to Dr Tofu about them. That would be an even better way for her to find out about how Kasumi and him were doing.<p>Coming up with some what of an acceptable idea, Akane rose again to knock on the door. "Nabiki, whats taking you so long? Is everything alright?"<p>There was no response. A few moments later, light footsteps could be heard approaching the door. Sure enough, the door opened to let a smiling Nabiki out. "Why Akane, sorry to take so long. I just had something very important to discuss with Dr Tofu. I'm really sorry I took so long."<p>"What did you discuss?" Akane asked as she slowly limped towards the clinic door.<p>"Tut, tut, tut, private." winked the middle Tendo.<p>The slowly walked towards the exit and let themselves out, heading towards home.<p>Inside the clinic, Ono Tofu sat quietly; he couldn't help but smile at Nabiki's prudence. She had winkled every bit of information she could out of him, though there wasn't much he could say. He was still dazed during the whole time Kasumi and him had gone out.<p>Kasumi. A new thought crossed his mind, turning his smile into a look expressing utter seriousness. He had hoped Kasumi would not get involved in Ranma's endeavors. She was the most innocent, well relatively as he recently found out, of people Tofu had ever met.<p>Happosai's influence on his students had really taken its toll. While not of perverted nature, they had become spineless cowards. Whatever they did manage to learn effectively was being lost because of their intense desire to marry off their offsprings to each other.<p>They were so focussed on the 'title' of joining the schools, they had not given the future of their children any thought because of which Ranma and Akane were both on the receiving ends of immense pressure.<p>It didn't help that Genma had put Ranma  through much horror when he was a kid. That didn't  matter much though...it is a cruel world. If Ranma  had glimpsed some hard times, it should only teach  him to be a better person and how to perform  better in life. Hard times tend to do that to  a person.<p>Soun seemed to have lost much of his own martial arts desire afte his wife had passed away.<p>Ranma, a man in Tofu's opinion, handles pressure the only way he was taught to. He took responsibility even if it wasn't his, but if he could not solve it at the moment, he tried to find any way to postone the time of decision.<p>Still, he had gone through more pressure than anyone else had. Tofu had a feeling that Elder Cologne was not paying attention on purpose, turning a blind eye to Shampoo's actions to see how much the young man could take.<p>Tofu knew better though. He knew that the Amazon Matriarch was getting her offspring to learn what the outside of her world had to offer. Shampoo also had to learn the hard way that people can't be won using gimmicks, or magic potions.<p>If she hadn't learned of anything of the trust between Ranma and Akane, no matter how much they fought...she should really read up a few books on relationships.<p>The only matter that worried him though, was how far Cologne was willing to overlook Shampoo's behavior. He had searched up on the Amazon law, when they had arrived. Though at times they were unforgiving, he wasn't so sure that the member's of the village council and matriach were heartless.<p>Then again...it was a cruel world. The Amazons were taught from the begining to persevere through any hardship...which is where Shampoo's persistance came from. It was many times directly centered towards hurting Akane enough to try and get her to let go.<p>Akane's pride never let her; Shampoo never badly hurt Akane either, even if there were times when she could have. Shampoo was not a bad person. Just used to fighting for what she wants. Since Akane never really had to work very hard for what she wanted...she felt discomforted and didn't know how to handle that discomfort.<p>The young doctor sighed at the complications that were revolving around Ranma. He sometimes truly felt sorry for the pig tailed martial artist.<p>He was behaving how he was conditioned to, like a machine, yet contained some very noble attributes and still managed to become the escape goat for Akane's anger.<p>Akane...she had also gone through almost as much pressure as Ranma, though in a different sense. Tofu never recalled anything about her putting up a big sign board saying, "Here I am, Kidnap me!"<p>She may not be as gifted as Ranma was in the art, but whatever she did do was well. It was her father's fault for not teaching her his side of the art. When asked about the control on her part, Soun Tendo had only replied saying that she was a young girl with lots of energy. It was a phase.<p>Ofcourse it was a phase. She was maturing, and she needed guidance. She was now the weakest of all the martial artists that had now come, one way or another, after Ranma. Her pride, which was one of her assets, now has become her own prison.<p>Even if the pressures she recieved from all the ends great, she still managed to go through the days happy. Eventually they did manage to get her to respond with more and more anger.<p>Whether they got married or not, it wouldn't matter. Akane still needed to grow up more to the real world. She needed to get out of the prison her pride and her father had built around her.<p>The world was not built around men. She needed a break to really live and find out what else she could to instead of stick to fighting off fiancees or Ranma or whatever next came along, which is exactly what happened today.<p>How this took place was a bit of a wonder. Apparently this person wasn't after Akane. It would seem he is Kasumi's old friend. Kasumi...The last person who should be involved in this matter should be Kasumi.<p>'Ranma...You better be careful...I really like you, but you are nothing but danger to innocent people, even if you might be innocent yourself.' thought the young man sitting in his chair.<p>If things continued like the way they did, he would have to interfere, even thought uptill now he had done so as little as possible.<p>"Master..." he sighed sitting in his chair...remembering...<p>End of Chapter 9
