</div>Chapter 7<p>That day in the bridal shop, everyone had crowded around Ranma, wanting to put their hands on her stomach, to feel the baby. Ranma soon tired of this, and made a polite excuse to Ukyou, saying she was tired, or hungry, or tired of being hungry, or something to that effect. The next months flew by in a blur of wedding preparations and new baby discoveries. Among those discoveries, new to Ranma at least, was that babies kicked often. Very often. Very often with one child, not to mention two. There were days when, if the children were turned around just right, and positioned up against the right sections of Ranma's stretched stomach, that one could barely make out the sight of small pressing from the inside. The fifth month passed without incident, other than people fawning all over Ranma's ever-swelling form, nearly smothering her in affection, concern, and attention. Akane stayed by her husband-turned-mother constantly, as much as she could before and after work. There were quite a few nights where the two would lay there silently on the couch cuddling, Ranma in her rather sizable maternity nightgown, and Akane in her petite blue pajamas. Their relationship seemed to grow considerably as Akane noticed what a giggle it brought out in Ranma when fingers were carefully, delicately run over that widening expanse of stomach Ranma possessed. The reaction, past giggling, was always the same. It consisted of a cute, almost embarrassed, blushing smile, and arms tightened around Akane's small frame. Every sensation seemed to be heightened to almost impossible to imagine levels, Ranma had commented, still worrying and wondering silently if perhaps she was enjoying this just a bit too much.<p>The sixth month brought worry and confusion as it was revealed in a checkup that one of the children was noticeably smaller than the other. Doctor Tofu, of course, reassured Ranma, but like any good parent, she was concerned about this deviation. Why would one of them be smaller? Was the bigger one somehow draining precious nourishment from the other? Or, was it, as Doctor Tofu said, just that one of them was smaller, and he'd not even have known that it was small, if not for another child to compare it to. Both were well within the normal range for size of babies in that stage of development, Tofu said. Still, Ranma worried, and worried, and when she worried, she ate, as all good worriers do. Ice cream, potato chips, chocolate chips, chocolate ice cream, chocolate strawberries, all the big players. This did nothing to help her frame, and before long, she wasn't able to go around much. She could still occasionally go out and do small tasks, like shopping for groceries and things, but if she went out, and came back, chances were that she wouldn't be out again.<p>Her wardrobe had long since been replaced by oversized and elastic pants, big sweatshirts, and other loose-fitting garments, so Ranma was getting comfortable with that aspect. She was not, however, getting used to some of the other aspects. By this time, she was huge, and she started to see herself as very unattractive. It hadn't mattered much to her before, but the currently female dominated mind of Ranma cried out the need to feel attractive and desired. Akane quickly picked up on these feelings, and the frequent cuddling and exchanges of soft, romantic whispers, went from 'frequently' to 'almost every night'. Akane was constantly telling Ranma how beautiful she looked, sneaking up behind her to kiss her, lightly tickling her belly, anything to put the smile back on Ranma's face, and the light blush on her cheeks. Ranma really *was* pretty amazing, Akane thought, to be doing all of this for no other reason than it was something Akane desired. Ranma had never previously expressed interest in children, having had enough of the 'heir to the family' business. Akane had expressed her interest though, and a year of trying, plus six months later, Ranma was huge and pregnant, carrying twins as a gesture of pure love to the woman that owned Ranma's heart.<p>Sometime in the seventh month, Ranma started to attend some 'expectant mother' classes. Breathing exercises, coaching on what to do when the big day came, things to bring to the hospital on the day of the delivery, generally everything that a mother would need to know to make that jump from 'expectant mother', to 'caretaker of a little life', or in Ranma's case, two. The classes moved on smoothly, with only few stares at Ranma and Akane, and none after explaining the very sweet story, and circumstances behind the pregnancy. All the mothers glared at the fathers, and the fathers got a nervous look on their faces, each swore up and down that they'd do the same thing, if it came down to it. Ranma and Akane looked at each other, giggled, and smiled. The classes were a regular thing after a few weeks, and it was just one more step in Ranma's preparedness for motherhood.<p>Eventually, Genma summoned up the courage to make a visit over to see Ranma in her much more female form. Genma was rather conflicted, knowing this meant an heir to the family, but also knowing that his son was having to go through "the disgrace of being a pregnant woman, and giving birth." Genma was never the smartest man alive, being as he said this in front of his wife, Akane, and Ranma, all at different times. All three women hit him soundly in the back of the head, muttering under their breath. Genma later pulled Ranma aside and hugged her, breaking down and telling her that perhaps the most manly thing a man could ever do, was give all of himself for his wife. Genma congratulated Ranma, and shared a rare moment of positive fatherhood with his son by pledging his full support and love throughout the entire rest of the pregnancy. Ranma, in true hormone-driven pregnant woman form, started crying hysterically, wrapping her arms around her father, and hugging him tightly, mumbling thanks in between sobs. Genma carefully placed his arms around Ranma's soft shoulders and hugged. Genma's nose caught a hint of perfume, and his eyes noticed running mascara, marking this down as one more thing that Ranma had suffered for the art. Surely, Ranma's children would be great, if their father and mother were so strong, Genma thought.<p>The further toward the eighth month that Ranma's pregnancy progressed, it seemed, the less she had on her mind other than the twins. Ranma's thoughts became consumed with the due date, with the nursery being prepared, with the crib being delivered, with every preparation being just exactly so. Ranma stressed herself at times, to points that Akane considered plainly unhealthy. Coming up with just the perfect distraction, Akane bought the smallest, blackest dress she could find, had Kasumi bring over dinner, and that night, wearing the dress with a set of stunning heels, her face accented with delicate touches of makeup, Akane crept up behind Ranma, and surprised her.<p>"Ranma..." Akane called, in a sultry voice, laden with flirtatious hints. "Turn around, please? I have something to show you."<p>Hearing this voice which sent shivers up her spine, Ranma turned around slowly. her jaw dropped clear to the floor at the sight of the angel named Akane. Akane held a wicker picnic basket in hand, black dress barely reaching her knees, lips bathed in deepest crimson, eyelashes coated in mascara, accenting their fullness magnificently. Ranma finally found her voice, and spoke up. "Akane... You... You... I can't believe... You're so beautiful, Akane." Fighting back an intensely uncomfortable warm blush, Ranma asked, "What's the picnic basket for, though?"<p>"For us, Ranma. I planned this for us." Akane said, walking around the couch enticingly, placing the picnic basket on the table. "You need to have a night off from worrying about the children. For the evening, the only person you have to worry about is me."<p>From the way the dress hung on Akane, Ranma could tell something was different. Was it a smaller size, meant to enhance Akane's petite frame? Was it a looser material? Or could it have been... Ranma's cheeks exploded pink again, as Ranma realized her wife wasn't wearing certain, rather necessary, undergarments. "E-even with my body like this... Akane... You know how to make me remember in a second that I love you more than anything on this earth." Ranma said.<p>Akane smiled simply, and placed a long romantic kiss onto the lips of her husband. "Of course I do. I'm smart like that, dear." As Akane pulled away, she giggled, noticing that some of the red lipstick had smudged onto Ranma's lips. "Darn..." Akane said, still giggling, staring into Ranma's eyes with a penetrating stare. "Guess I'll just have to smudge the rest off too."<p>With Ranma showing no objections, Ranma and Akane smooched for quite a long period of time, drinking in all the wonderful feelings of love coursing through the two of them. Eventually, they got around to dinner, Ranma knew Kasumi made it, but thanked Akane all the same, telling her what a great chef she'd become today. Akane giggled and pecked Ranma's cheek, saying what a silly girl Ranma was, and that it was obvious that Kasumi had made it. Ranma smiled, nodding, and saying that she knew, of course, before kissing Akane again. "Thank you." Ranma said, as she held Akane in her arms, not even noticing that the time had dragged on to the very wee hours of the morning. Ah, but it was a Friday night, time didn't matter to lovers. Even so, Akane eventually glanced at the clock, and nudged Ranma's side. The two of them shuffled off into the bedroom, where clothes were discarded, pajamas put on, and two lovers laid in bed together.<p>The eighth month came, and filled with anticipation, Ranma hardly noticed it's passing, save the doctor's visits that punctuated the time Ranma still had to wait for this long ordeal of pregnancy to finally come to its wonderful, yet painful, conclusion. Ranma's eyes nearly jumped from her head when she was informed that a normal time for labor, for a first pregnancy, was around twelve to fourteen hours. Twins, Ranma imagined, would take even longer. It began settling in to Ranma's mind, that this was going to be a very slow last month.<p>The date had been finally set for Ukyou's wedding, for a week, exactly, before Ranma's due date. Everyone was in a rush trying to piece together last minute details. In the months before, with Ranma's help, Ukyou had secured Kasumi and her business to be the head caterers, along with the best florists and decorators that could be found around the city, and for the most reasonable price. Nabiki had a large hand in the 'most reasonable price' department. It was amazing how many pictures Nabiki's surveillance teams gathered of less-than-faithful husbands, wives, girlfriends, politicians, and so on. The church was also booked, a sprawling, elegant, pristine chapel that could seat hundreds, although nowhere near that number were planned to attend. Decorating on the church wouldn't begin until days before the actual wedding, although plans had already been drawn up, and now were being finalized. The plans called for white flowers to be everywhere one could possibly think to put them, and an elegant candle stand to be placed on the stage. Ukyou debated having the ceremony by candlelight, but soon axed that idea when she thought of herself tripping on her dress in the dark, and making a spectacle of herself in front of everyone.<p>With Ranma's help, the bridesmaid dresses had been picked out long ago. Ranma wouldn't be in the wedding herself, because she didn't think she could stand up for that long, for one, and for two, she didn't really want to wear a nice dress when she was pregnant, that she'd never get to wear again. Ukyou asked Akane to be her maid of honor, while the other Tendou sisters agreed to be the bridesmaids, being that Ukyou didn't really have many female friends. The fitting for the bridesmaid dresses was somewhat of a silly affair, what with the three sisters and Ukyou giggling and talking about Ranma.<p>"He's really sweet, you know, Sis." Kasumi said, fussing with the buttons on the back of her dress. "You two really are nice together."<p>Nabiki just blushed, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror, dressed much more like a woman than she normally preferred. 'I'm... I guess I am sort of pretty..' She thought.<p>Akane giggled and poked Nabiki's side, noticing the blush. "What's wrong, Sis? You look wonderful in that dress, you know. Or is that the problem?"<p>Kasumi put a hand to her mouth and giggled softly, while Ukyou looked on, having final adjustments made to her gown. Ukyou spoke up while she stood mostly motionless on the slightly raised platform. "All three of you look great. Thanks so much for doing this for me... It's nice that I have at least you three girls. I've never really been... that great at friendships."<p>"I'm glad to, Ukyou. I know we've sort of had problems before.. but.. Hey, that's in the past, right?" Akane said, smirking and giggling before adding. "I did win though."<p>"You sure did, Akane... My guy's pretty great too though. Tall, handsome, charming, aaah..." Ukyou sighed dreamily, as she said this. Her eyes lost focus and drifted off into the distance.<p>All three of the Tendou sisters giggled at once at this display.<p>Meanwhile, back at her house, Ranma was cleaning up some things, just to stay busy. "This house is a disaster..." Ranma sighed, picking up a towel in the bathroom, as a series of light kicks came from the two tiny lives within her. "Ooh, you guys are upset about it too, huh? I'm working, I'm working..." Ranma finished up in the bathroom, and moved into the nursery. For some reason, the twins seemed to be calmer when Ranma rocked in the large, dark, wooden rocking chair. Ranma sat herself down in the chair, and stared around the room, admiring what her plans had come to. The room was decorated in swirls of light pink and baby blue, being as it'd hold twins, and Ranma had decided with Akane not to find out Ranma giggled furiously, as her eyes fell on the huge stuffed panda sitting in the corner. "Hi, Dad." Ranma said.<p>Akane came in the front door, carrying a large clear bag, that contained her dress. She called through the house, after not finding Ranma anywhere in the kitchen or living room. "Ranma! Where are you?"<p>"In the nursery, Akane!" Ranma called back, still rocking slowly in the chair. "Calming the kids down a little!" Of course, Ranma's yelling only got her more of the somewhat uncomfortable kicks.<p>"Oh, really..." Akane said, as she walked into the nursery, still carrying the bag. A broad smile went over her face upon seeing Ranma in the rocking chair, going back and forth calmly. It seemed Ranma was humming something, a little tune of some sort. She was staring down at her stomach, as she did. Akane's smile only widened, and she moved in, placing her hands on Ranma's shoulders. "You're going to make such a wonderful mother, Ranma." Akane said.<p>Ranma hardly noticed Akane coming home, or coming to the nursery. Only when she felt Akane's hands on her shoulder, did Ranma look up. "Hmm, Akane? Did everything go well today? Is that your dress?" Ranma said.<p>"Yeah, it is.. Isn't it nice? Green's not exactly my color, but this is Ukyou's wedding, not mine..." Akane said, kissing Ranma's cheek briefly. "Everything went fine with me today, how about you?"<p>Ranma stopped rocking, still looking back. "Great, really... The kids were getting restless, that's when I came in here. I cleaned up a little though... heh, these children just wear me out though, I'm sorry if the house is messy.."<p>"Oh, don't worry about that, Ranma, you have enough on your mind." Akane said, with a giggle, adding, "And in your belly." Akane went around beside her husband, and placed her hands on Ranma's stomach. In a matter of seconds, she felt a little kick press against her hand. A smile shot across her face, and she kissed Ranma's cheek. "I love you, Ranma." Akane said.<p>"I wish this rocking chair was big enough for both of us.." Ranma said, starting to rock again, to calm the children. "It'd be nice." A broad smile went over Ranma's face. She looked rather different than she had those short eight months earlier. Faint traces of the old Ranma were still able to be seen occasionally, in her protective nature, her compassion, her sweetness, her arrogance at times, although even these were passed through the filter of a pregnant mother. Ranma started slowly rocking back and forth again, humming that same tune once more, slowly, softly, and melodically.<p>Akane stood there, smiling, lost in watching the scene before her. 'When did this happen?' She thought. 'When did the "pervert" I grew up with, and the "idiot" I married, turn into this... Amazing other person?" After taking it all in for a moment more, Akane spoke up. "Ranma, you're absolutely amazing. I never noticed it before, for some reason, but your voice is so... Beautiful. And that tune you're humming, it's very sweet."<p>Ranma stopped rocking again for a second, and looked over. A faint pink tint adorned Ranma's cheeks as she replied. "Thanks, Akane... As for the tune, It just seemed appropriate. I remember a woman, my mom, humming it to me, when I was a baby."<p>Akane got a bit misty eyed, and sighed, turning to walk away. She wanted to change the subject, so she grabbed the clear plastic bag and held it in her hands. "I'm going to go put on my dress, and show you. O-ok?" Akane said, hardly noticing the creaking noise that the wooden chair made when Ranma stood. Akane felt two soft hands on her shoulders as she was leaving the room, and whispered gently, "Ranma..."<p>"Shh, Akane." Ranma said, "I saw that. I made you think about your mother, didn't I?" Seconds later, Ranma found herself holding a petite, crying mass of tender feelings, and fresh hurts. "It's ok, Akane. I've got you." Ranma said, moving one arm to cradle Akane's head against Ranma's shoulder. Ranma's other hand moved to Akane's back, slowly rubbing in small circles.<p>"I miss her, Ranma." Akane said, still sobbing.<p>"I know, Akane. It's ok. She was a very important person, and I'm sure a wonderful mother. The best way you can remember her, though, is to be just as wonderful of a mother to your children. You've got two on the way, I'd say that's a start." Ranma said, smiling.<p>"How do you do that, Ranma?" Akane asked.<p>"How do I do what? Know what you're thinking?" Ranma questioned. Seeing Akane nod, Ranma leaned in closer, to whisper in Akane's ear. "This time I guessed." Ranma said, giggling faintly as she drew back.<p>"Lucky guess." Akane said, wiping her eyes on a tissue from her pocket.<p>"I've considered myself lucky since the day you said you loved me, Akane." Ranma said, cheeks tinting pink as she did.<p>"Ranma... I just stopped crying, why'd you have to go and say something like that?" Akane said, giggling.<p>"Because it's true." Ranma replied, holding Akane closer.
