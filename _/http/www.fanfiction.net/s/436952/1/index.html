</div>This story is set 3-5 years after the end of the series. ranma and akane's relationship developed even further, and they got married, moved out, all that fun happy stuff. (:P on you all if you say 'hahaha ur SO original, lol!')<p>It was a typical day.<p>The funny thing about that is that it was an *actual* typical day. for a *normal* married couple. See, once Ranma and Akane got married, and subsequently moved, their lives became much less chaotic. Ranma got a job as a gym teacher at a local school, and was starting a small martial arts class as well. Akane... well, she also taught classes in martial arts, but it was a class for self defense for women. I hear violent crime's been down 30% since she's been teaching.. As our story begins, Ranma and Akane are nervously sitting in the doctor's office (Tofu, of course.) awaiting results on tests run on Akane. Ranma and Akane had decided to try and have children... with very little success.<p>"Mr. Saotome.. Mrs. Saotome.. I have some.." The doctor swallowed, and took a deep breath, holding a file of papers in his hands. "Disappointing news for you. It seems that Akane has a condition... That prevents her from bearing children. Her uterus.. The lining is abnormally thin."<p>Ranma sat there, silently, no emotion showing on his face. It was unmanly to cry, although that's what he wanted to do most in the world. He loved Akane. After all it took to finally be able to say that, he wanted to be able to have the ultimate expression of that love. A child. But now it seemed that was impossible.<p>Akane sat there also, looking down at herself, almost ashamed. It wasnt long, however, before she burst into tears, laying her head on Ranma's shoulder, soaking the sleeve. "Y..You're sure, Doc? I.. I mean.. There couldnt have been some flaw in the test?"<p>"We don't know what else to do. The x-rays we took show that you're otherwise healthy.. But considering that you and your husband have tried many times, as you said, we've come to this conclusion." he said, a note of sadness in his voice, for the couple.<p>Ranma was being overwhelmed with grief, as he stroked through his sobbing bride's soft hair, and tried to whisper words of comfort to her. "Shh.. Akane.. It'll be ok.. He said you were healthy.. So we'll adopt... or just keep trying.." Ranma let out a deep sigh, before continuing in this desperate effort to make her feel better, although his next statement would only serve to bring back that missing sense of weirdness in their lives. "I want to do something... If.. I could do something.. If i could have the children for you.." Ranma stopped. He realized his words. The curse hadn't even crossed his mind.. Then he heard light giggling from both the doctor and his wife.<p>"Ranma..." Akane said, wiping her eyes.. "Did you hear what you just said?"<p>Tofu snickered, and added, "With the right preparation of Ranma's cursed form.. it might work.."<p>Ranma of course, just hung his head.<p>The Doctor and Akane struggled to keep in those last few laughs, before turning serious once more. After several moments, Dr. Tofu turned back to Ranma, and began explaining.<p>"Due to your... unique physiology, Ranma, there's a good chance you'd be able to carry a child. We'd have to give you hormone supplements, and watch you very closely, but there's definitely a decent chance. Why don't you talk this over with your wife, I'll give you two some privacy." Upon finishing his speech, the Doctor slipped out of the room, closing the door with a firm thud.<p>Ranma spoke first, before Akane had a chance to. A very faint smile crossed over Ranma's face, "Don't even say it, Akane... You know i'd do anything in this world for you.. But this.. this is.." He sighed heavily, before continuing, "I don't know, Akane. Me being a mother? I don't even know the first thing about being a woman.. how am i supposed to be a mother?"<p>Akane looked him square in the eyes, then took him in a firm embrace, and kissed him. "I love you, you big goof... Ranma, you know as much about it as any girl. You've lived with it for quite a while now. And no mother ever knows exactly what to do when they first start out. You're sweet, caring, loving, and protective. That's all you'd need to be a wonderful mother. You know how i feel about having kids, we've been trying for months now. This would make me happy, but i won't ask you to do it unless you're willing."<p>Dr. Tofu peeked back in, grabbing the chart from the counter beside the door. "Sorry to interrupt, i'm just going to take care of these charts while you two talk things over." He started back out the door, but Ranma called to him.<p>"Doc? Wait a sec.." Ranma said, with a hint of hesitation.<p>"Hmm, what is it?" Tofu replied, turning around.<p>"If.. If you're sure that this will be safe... and that we have a good chance at it... I'll do it.." Grabbing Akane's hand, Ranma smiled.<p>Akane brought their clasped hands up, and kissed Ranma's, right over his wedding ring. "Ranma, I love you.. And don't worry, i'm sure the great Ranma Saotome won't be beaten by a silly girl thing like pregnancy. You can take a little pain, can't ya?" Akane trailed off into laughing, hugging her husband tightly.<p>Ranma smiled brighter, whispering into his wife's ear, "Tomboy..."<p>To which she, rather predictably whispered back, "Pervert..."<p>They both laughed, and hugged each other, before Ranma turned back around to the doctor.<p>"So, Doc, what're we going to do about my curse? I mean, i cant very well be turning back into a guy while i'm pregnant.." Ranma said, looking with concern at the trusted family physician in the white lab coat.<p>Dr. Tofu thought for a while, putting his hand on his chin, before starting, "The curse acts on what's different in your body... If we did go ahead with this.. we might be able to trick it into thinking you were a girl.. then nothing would happen.. You'd need quite a few hormone shots, Ranma, just even to get your female body ready to accept an egg... Perhaps that would do it.. I suppose we'll have to see, wont we?"<p>Ranma sighed deeply, and looked down. "Last time that's gonna be flat for a while, huh?" He laughed shortly, nervously, then he hugged Akane tight, stroking through her hair slowly. "Akane, i love you so much... Just remember that when i'm cranky, and big, and 8 months pregnant.."<p>Akane smiled, and put her hands on his chest, "I'll try not to tease you too much, Mrs. Saotome..." Another round of light laughter, before Akane's face got much more serious. "Ranma, you know I love you too. We'll do this together."<p>(i'm going to refer to ranma-chan as just ranma. so deal :D)<p>Ranma and Akane were back at the Doctor's office once again, only this time their positions were reversed. Ranma was the patient, and Akane was the supportive spouse. Everything had gone fine so far, Tofu's hormone theory panned out, it'd been 14 days since Ranma's last change, and she was slowly getting used to it. The underwear would *definitely* need some work, however. Ranma figured what with having their child, she could get Akane to buy her some more comfortable underclothing. And a nightgown. Ranma shook her head, but then smiled, she was going to be like this for quite a while if it worked, so she'd be better off just to play along. Besides, if Akane looked so great in a nightgown, Ranma would be a complete knockout, and Ranma could get Akane back for all those jokes she'd been making.<p>Doctor Tofu came into the room, a broad smile crossing his face. He held a clipboard out infront of him, and he began talking. "Congratulations, you two.. Ranma's pregnant."<p>Akane was overjoyed, and she clasped her hands together, exclaiming "Oh, Ranma! It worked! You're going to be a mother! Isn't this so exciting?" Akane clung tightly to her very shocked looking spouse. The smile on Akane's face looked as if it'd take days to wear off.<p>Ranma sat there, not knowing whether to blush, scream, faint, cry, laugh, or wail. "Th.. That's great news, doc..." She then turned to Akane, her previous concerns seeming unbelieably silly, although she still blurted them out. "I'm.. gonna have to get some... New underwear and pajamas.. I'm.. i'm having a baby.." How those two went together, actually, is unknown to anyone<br/>but Ranma, but Akane was really in no kind of mood to argue, what with the elated state she was in.<p>"It really was rather," Tofu said, with a cough. "Routine, for something of this nature, and something concerning you, Ranma. I'm suprised, actually. Technically you'll both be the mother, you know.. Akane for the egg, and Ranma for carrying the baby."<p>Akane blinked, and smiled to Ranma, only to see her smiling right back. Ranma's lips parted, and she silently whispered "Congratulations."<p>The two made their way out of the hospital, and back to their apartment. They'd hardly hit the door before the phone rang. Nervously, Ranma picked it up. Her mother's voice sounded clearly on the other end. "Hello? Ranma? How'd it go?", Nodoka asked.<p>It was hard enough just to tell their parents about this decision, and when they did, Genma went through the usual hysterics, accusing Ranma of being a disgrace to his family, and his manhood. Soun would have said most of the same things, except his words were interrupted by a fierce wailing. "My daughter will never bear children! Our family line is doomed!", he moaned.<p>Nodoka, however, was supportive. Wasn't that how mothers were supposed to behave? Yes, yes it was, she told herself, as the couple related first the tragic beginning, then the happy solution. Nodoka had a feeling from the first time that Ranma and Akane told her about this, that it was not only a possibility, since it involved these two, and was far from normal, it was<br/>almost a certainty.<p>Ranma finally answered her mother, softly, in a feminine voice that neither of them quite recognized. "Mom.. I'm.. gonna be a mom too.." It was now that the tears decided to come, and in an instant, Akane was by Ranma's side, holding her tightly, trying to comfort her.<p>Akane took the phone from Ranma, and spoke. "Mom..." It almost felt strange, still, to call Nodoka 'Mom', but Akane did it anyways, because it not only reminded her that she had a friend in Nodoka that she loved, and that loved her enough, to be called mom, it also reminded her of her real mother, sitting up somewhere, smiling down on the two of them. Akane got back to the conversation, from her happy reminiscing, and continued. "Mom, this has been a really emotional day for Ranma.. We're just gonna need some time to figure out what this means for us. You'll be coming by with everyone on Sunday for lunch, right?"<p>"Right, dear." Nodoka, said, with a long pause before she continued, "Give Ranma the phone again, please?<p>Akane handed the phone back to Ranma, who'd recovered from her little crying spell. If there was one thing Ranma would have the hardest time getting used to, it was the insanely fragile emotional state she was finding herself in, more and more. "Y..Yeah, mom?" Ranma asked, sniffling.<p>"Ranma.. I love you, and i'm proud of you. You're going to make an excellent mother. Don't hesitate to call me for anything, any time, day or night. It will be ok, Ranma.. We're all here for you." Nodoka said this in the way that only a mother could, talking to her child. Even if Ranma was becoming a parent herself, Nodoka would always see her as the little child, face shining, looking up to his mother, and asking if some day he'd be big like her. Little did he know...<p>This, however, didn't serve too well to stop the fits of crying, and although Ranma kept it under control enough to keep talking, her sobs drowned out most of the words in her head. "Mom, i... you're... I love you, Mom. I'll see you on Sunday."<p>"Maybe sooner, dear." Nodoka said, planning right then to not only have a baby shower for Ranma in the next few days, but also to stop by tomorrow to simply hold her child in her arms, one last time, before her child graduated to the one doing the holding.<p>"O..Ok, Mom. Bye.." Ranma weepily said, waiting for a response on the other end before hanging it up, and falling into Akane's arms.<p>"We'll do this together, Ranma.. I won't leave your side, ever." Akane felt the need to lighten the mood after that particular statement, so she added, "But don't think for one second that just because you're pregnant means you get to turn all girly on me, Ranma Saotome.."<p>Ranma's eyes brightened slightly, and a laugh was forced out between the tears, as she shakily spoke up. "And.. Don't think that just because your husband is having your child, that means you get to turn into even more of a tomboy on me, Akane Saotome.." Ranma grinned broadly, hugging Akane tightly.<p>"By the way, hon, what in the world did you mean by that comment about underwear and pajamas?", Akane asked, walking to the kitchen to make some tea.<p>"Oh.." A bright blush flooded Ranma's face. "Well, i just meant that these *things* i'm wearing are a little uncomfortable... and about the pajamas.. If i have to be stuck like this for our child," she started grinning a little, "I might as well drive you nuts while i do it. How's it gonna feel when a pregnant man looks sexier in a nightgown than you, hon?" Ranma said this all just to get Akane to react, of course.<p>Soon after these comments, Akane sat the kettle down on the stove with a clang, and walked back into the living room. "I'll show you sexy, Ranma Saotome..." With that, she placed her hands behind Ranma's head, and drew the redhead's lips to hers, kissing them with a passion reserved only for those who were man and wife.. Or in this case, Jusenkyo-cursed-currently-female-pregnant-man, and wife. Akane broke the kiss, and undid the buttons to her shirt, letting it fall open, exposing the delicate lace of the bra she wore.<p>Ranma stuttered over and over, tripping on her words "A..A..Ak..Akane.. St..St.. Stop that.. Stop that right now. Ok? You.. You.. You win."<p>Akane giggled loudly, and buttoned her shirt back up, kissing Ranma's lips sweetly once more, before returning to her tea.<p>Ranma's face finally returned to a shade of red different to her hair, and she spoke up again, as she heard rain beginning to fall, outside. "Akane.. I'm gonna go think for a little while, ok?" Perhaps it was rude, but Ranma didn't wait for a response, before putting on a small jacket, and walking out to the covered porch space afforded them on their ground floor apartment. She took a seat on the ground, and started to run her hands over her stomach, wanting to talk not only to herself, but to the little life starting inside of her.<p>"Hey there.." She started, "Well.. Guess i'm your mom, huh? I sure never thought i'd be saying that.. I always thought my place would be holding Akane's hand next to her in the delivery room, not laying on the bed doing the delivering.. I probably should have guessed something like this though, what with the way my life was. I was so scared the first time i came out of that spring, you know.. There it'd been drilled into me for years that girls were weak, pathetic, under 'us men'.. stuff like that.. then there i am, staring at what i'd been told was the worst thing in the world to be." Akane slipped out then, with two steaming mugs of tea, but apparently Ranma was still lost in her thoughts.<p>Ranma started up talking again, seemingly not even knowing that Akane was around. "You know... I never have told anyone this.. and now here i am talking to my stomach. Sure am glad this thunderstorm is picking up, maybe noone'll here me this way.. Back to my story though, when i first pulled myself out, and opened my shirt.. I have to say i felt.. a little weird staring at those things on my chest.. Like there was something really, really wrong with it. Ah, if Akane heard me, she'd probably just say it was 'early signs of being a pervert', but i know she loves me... that's just the way we play around with each other. She's not really a tomboy, ya know.. She's really very cute.. definitely attractive.. You know, kid, you're gonna be beautiful. Look what you've got working for you.. I really do love your mother, you know.. this won't be so bad."<p>Akane was struggling to not sniffle by now, and she opened the door very slightly, then shut it rather loudly, producing the expected effect of startling Ranma out of her thoughts. Ranma looked back and smiled, a very pretty, modest, almost feminine smile. Akane walked over and sat the tea cups off to one side, taking Ranma in her arms. "Ranma Saotome.. You are the greatest man alive.. I'm honored to be the woman you love, and the mother.." she giggled just slightly, "Well, the *technical* mother, of your children." The two embraced warmly, exchanging a soft kiss, before Akane spoke again. "Rain is so romantic, don't you think, Ranma?" Ranma just lay there in Akane's arms. It almost looked like Ranma was clinging to Akane desperately.. as if letting go would be something more terrible to her than being a girl for a time, more terrible to her even than going through the pain of childbirth. Ranma clung to Akane as if letting go would be the end, the end of Ranko's life, the end of her future, the end of everything she'd worked so hard for.<p>Finally, an answer had to come, and Ranma answered back very plainly. "Yeah, Akane.. Rain is romantic.. Never thought about it like that before though." A warm smile was offered to Akane, and she accepted it with one of her own, running through the redhead's hair gently with her fingers.<p>"You ever noticed how soft your hair was, Ranma? I mean, really.. It's amazing.. I think it might even be softer in your male form than right now." Akane said, still running her fingers slowly through the hair of the woman cuddled to her. "Ranma.. I have to be honest with you.. I heard you talking to yourself.. I should have gone back in, but then you would have heard anyways." Akane took a small sip of her tea, then continued. "I heard what you said about the spring.. about your body.. I know it must have been.." She fumbled for the right word. "Overwhelming. Changing like that from one moment to the next. I heard what you said about me, too, Ranma. And.. And.." Akane started sniffling, then she gathered herself enough to finish, "Ranma, you're not a pervert, just because of one misunderstanding that i never bothered to resolve. You're right, you know.. Our child is going to be amazing."<p>Ranma was nearly moved to tears as well, but she shrugged it off as hormones, and that mood swing stuff that always happened to pregnant women. "Akane.. Hon.. Lets go to bed, it's getting late. You've got something for me to wear, right? I mean.. If sleep like i used to how well is that gonna work out? Especially when i get to being twice this size?"<p>Akane smiled, and stood up, picking the teacups back up again. "Ranma, this is all gonna work out, trust me. I've got some pajamas that i think might fit you now, or a nightgown or something." Akane giggled and then added, "Hey, if you're really feeling adventurous, you could always try on that little number you got me for our first anniversary. Soft.. Sexy... Very pink.." Akane was still giggling as the smirk broke out on Ranma's face.<p>"Who says I haven't already, huh?" Ranma said, walking into the house, and looking back with that teasing expression still on her face.<p>Akane blushed a faint red, then came in, putting up the teacups and kettle, before walking into the bedroom. Apparently Ranma already knew the fine art of putting on a nightgown, and as such, she was already dressed in a very understated blue cotton one. Akane looked at her and giggled, then smiled and changed herself, into a nightshirt and long cotton pants of nearly the same color. She settled into bed, and pulled Ranma to her side once again, commenting, "You look very beautiful tonight, Mrs. Saotome. Your husband better not catch you in here with me, he might start thinking things."<p>Ranma's reply was movement to slip her arms around Akane's laying form, and the added words, "Let him think whatever he wants.. I'm not letting go of you tonight."<p>"Oh, Ranma..." Akane sighed, clinging tighter to the small redhead laying beside her. Ranma really could be a very romantic person, when he tried, thought Akane, as she lay there pondering all that'd be happening over the next couple of months... the next couple of years... "Ranma, what's going to happen with us?" Suddenly, Akane's concerns found a voice, and as expected, Ranma was right there to comfort her.<p>"Well, your husband's gonna be pregnant for a while, then he'll have to give birth to this kid, and i imagine there'll be a bit of screaming at that part. Then we'll raise our child together, and in 20 years, sit back and look at what a wonderful job we've done with our sweet, caring, handsome son, or our innocent, intelligent, beautiful daughter." Ranma smiled reassuringly to Akane, kissing her cheek with the feather soft lips Ranma's girl form posessed. "Now let's get some sleep, huh, Akane? I'm sure we've got a big day tomorrow." Ranma pulled Akane closer, so that her head was resting on Ranma's rather cushiony chest. "You comfortable, hon?" Ranma asked.<p>Akane giggled a little at the position her head was in currently, but hey.. It was pretty soft, no wonder Ranma always liked sleeping like that. "I've got you in my arms, don't i? How much more comfort could i even stand?" She said, smiling, before drifting off into peaceful sleep.<p>Ranma followed soon after, but not before she brushed back Akane's hair, and whispered gently into her ear. "Sweet dreams.."<p>Akane awoke slowly, her eyes stinging at the intrusion of the sun's rays through the window. Akane turned to hug Ranma, but there was only empty space and covers, where once a cute little redheaded girl had been. Akane strained her senses to figure out where Ranma could have slipped off to, and heard a faint sound of someone gagging. She immediately bolted from the bed and rushed to the bathroom, where she found Ranma hunched over the toilet, clutching at her stomach, and releasing the contents repeatedly into the porcelain bowl.<p>"Ugh... Man, Akane.. What in the world is wrong with me.." Ranma said, again becoming sick.<p>Akane replied fairly hesitantly, saying, "Well, Ranma... That's... Morning sickness. Sometimes pregnant women get it... It probably wont last too long though."<p>"I sure hope it doesnt..." Ranma sighed, getting up. "I'm feeling better now.. I think i'll be ok."<p>A knocking sound could be heard at the door, and Akane went to get it while Ranma busied herself with cleaning up for the day. She started by very carefully washing around her face and neck, wiping off her forehead more than once. Then she used a fluffy cotton towel from the rack to dry herself off. Last, she wrapped a nice looking, but slightly feminine, robe around her slender body, and tied it closed with the belt, heading for the living room. "Who's here, hon...", Ranma stopped mid-sentance and blushed brightly, seeing her mother standing just inside the house.<p>"Ranma... dear... Your mom's here to see you..", Akane said, stating the obvious to a furiously blushing Ranma. "She wants to talk to you alone.. So i'm just gonna go out for a walk.. I'll be back later." Akane went in the bedroom momentarily to change into some jogging clothes, then she headed out.<p>Immediately after the door shut on Akane's exit, Nodoka sat down on the couch, and patted the space beside her. "Come sit down next to me, my child..", she said, watching Ranma move over, and take the seat offered. "You look terrible, dear..." Nodoka commented, pulling her now-daughter into a close, motherly embrace, continuing. "You've been sick, haven't you.."<p>Ranma nodded, and pulled closer to her mother, not saying a word. It was almost impossible to think of something to say, even though it'd been years since Nodoka forgot all about that silly suicide pact. The way Nodoka had explained it, the pact was just a ploy to appeal to Genma's self preservation instinct. If he had felt his life was in danger, then he wouldn't have left. Nodoka never imagined that her son would become a daughter. Finally, Ranma spoke up, muttering something pure, filled with emotion, and seemingly painful to say. "Mom.. What does this mean? Have i failed at living up to your dream of having a manly son to be proud of?" Ranma began sobbing. It was a feminine, pointless activity, she felt, although the nightgown, and covering robe did little to say that she was anything but feminine at the current time.<p>"Ranma, i never want you to speak of that again, do you hear me?", Nodoka scolded. A small nod came from Ranma, and her mother began speaking again. "You have made me proud over, and over again. You married a wonderful woman, you have a respectable job helping young children, and here you are this very instant, sacrificing all that you see yourself as, for the woman you love. Never think i am anything but honored to have you for my son." As she quieted down, Nodoka began stroking through her daughter's hair, and rubbing her daughter's back, in an attempt to comfort her.<p>"Mom..." Ranma whimpered, between her tears. "I... You have to know that i've been running from this since the day i fell in that stupid spring.. I fought my whole life to get away from being a girl, and now here i am, doing the most female thing i can imagine."<p>Nodoka quieted her daughter, then started speaking herself. "Ranma, do you regret your decision to allow your wife to be a mother?"<p>"O.. Of course not, mom..", Ranma answered.<p>"Then that is all that matters, dear. You are still you, no matter what you look like, or what your body is." Nodoka said, continuing to stroke through her daughter's hair, and place motherly kisses on her daughter's forehead.<p>Obviously, more time than the two of them thought passed, had passed, and Akane came strolling back in, only to see Nodoka and Ranma curled up on the couch, sharing very personal time together. "I...I'll just come back later." Akane turned to go back outside.<p>"No, please come over here, Akane." Nodoka said. She watched as Akane came and sat on the floor beside the couch. "I think you should be here for this. Taking care of a child is a long, stressful, painful... Sometimes unbeliveably painful.. process. A child needs both of it's parents to have a chance in life. I was going to tell Ranma some of the things i learned raising him, but since you're here, i suppose you need to hear too." Over the course of the next few hours, the wise matriarch imparted her wisdom upon the two future mothers, going over just about everything that the two wouldnt have to learn through experience.<p>"I think that about covers it, you two... the rest you'll have to just get on your own.. Every child is different... Now, if you could go on for a little, again, Akane, There are some other things i'd like to talk to my daughter about." Nodoka said.<p>"O..Ok, mom.." Akane said, releasing Ranma's hand from the grip it had been in,then walking to the bedroom to change from her running wear.<p>Ranma shifted around in her seat a bit, looking carefully at her mother. "What else did you want to tell me, mom?", she said, hands carefully placed over her chest still, from hearing about breastfeeding.<p>"Ranma, dear.." Nodoka sighed, "I think that maybe it'd be better if you showed a bit more femininity in this time when you're... well... doing the most female thing i know of.."<p>Ranma blushed a bit, and untied her robe, showing the cotton nightgown underneath, the straps of the bra she was wearing protruded through the neck hole slightly. "Umm.. Mom.. I think i'm a little ahead of you, there.." Ranma blushed again, and laughed nervously. "I'm gonna go get changed, ok.. You want to come... help me pick out something?"<p>Nodoka just smiled, and stood up, taking Ranma's hand, and helping her up. "Sure, Ranma, that'd be wonderful.." This isn't quite so bad, Nodoka said to herself. Atleast i'll get to feel what it would have been like to have a daughter, for a little while... She smiled a bit wider, and walked with Ranma back to the bedroom.
