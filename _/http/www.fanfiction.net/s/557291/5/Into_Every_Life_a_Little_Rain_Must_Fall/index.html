</div><p><b>Into  Every Life, a Little Rain Must Fall<br/>A  Ranma 1/2 (manga) fanfic by NemesisZero</b></p><p><b>Act  2: Friction in the Machine<br/>Part  4</b></p><p>"Insider"  Pre-readers:</p><p>Freak247<br/>Thermopyle<br/>Tonyloco</p><p>"Outsider"  Pre-readers:</p><p>Akraen<br/>Buuchan<br/>Grookill<br/>Pyeknu<br/>Ray  DeVore<br/>Yakumo</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>He  lay on his back on a small bedroll, staring mindlessly with  half-lidded eyes at the ceiling. Random thoughts trailed through his  mind, stirred relentlessly by his anchorless consciousness, until  they blurred, intermingled, and overlapped so thoroughly that they  ceased to make any sense whatsoever. Featureless faces laughed at  him, explosions of light rocked his universe with the intolerable  scent of his own burning flesh, and all the while, he stared at the  ceiling.</p><p>Ranma  had so far managed to avoid sleep... or had it eluded him? He didn't  know anymore, and he no longer cared. The only thing that mattered  was that his life was a waking hell, and the only way to escape would  be to destroy himself, either physically or in spirit. Running away,  even into the arms of death, was his father's way, not his. If he  took that step, knowing full well that he had no plans to regroup and  try again, he would cease to be himself. Saotome Ranma was doomed,  and he knew it, but he was still determined to go down fighting. Now  all he had to do was figure out how he could fight back at all.</p><p>"Ranma,  time to get up! You don't want to be late for school, do you?"</p><p>Oh,  and there was that, too. "I'm up already," he announced,  hoping he wouldn't have to explain this latest complication to her  while the katana was within reach. With a groan he stretched and sat  up, forcing his mind back into a reasonable facsimile of  consciousness. "Uh, Mom? About school..."</p><p>"Come  on, Dear, get dressed. We can talk over breakfast, but you had  better get ready soon so you can get back to Nerima by eight,"  she suggested, turning to leave. "You can start by explaining  why you're not at the Tendos'."</p><p>"Mom,  there's no hurry. I don't need to go to school today."</p><p>"Has  your father been filling your head with his nonsense again?" she  asked, looking at him sharply. "You need a proper education,  Ranma, even to be a dojo instructor."</p><p>"No,  Mom. I... I got expelled from school yesterday." Seeing the  disapproving stare harden, he quickly elaborated, "Apparently  Pop engaged me to the principal's insane daughter as collateral on a  loan, so now Mr. Kuno is trying to force me to marry her."</p><p>"So  you decided that since you were free of the obligation you would come  and help me finish moving back into the house?" she asked,  projecting a hopeful look. "I can't say that being expelled is  a good thing, but at least you're thoughtful."</p><p>"Well,  I also got kicked out of the Tendos' the night before on account of a  fight with an idiot," he began, but quickly tied up that  statement as her smile fell a bit, "But yeah, I guess you could  say I just wanted to come see you again."</p><p>"Well,  in that case, go ahead and change clothes," she replied, turning  to leave, "and after breakfast we can get started on the rest of  the furniture."</p><p>"Umm,"  he answered, holding the back of his head sheepishly, "I don't  have anything else to wear. Mr. Tendo wouldn't let me back in the  house to pack, and the only change of clothes I had with me sorta got  left in my gym locker."</p><p>She  stopped abruptly. "He wouldn't let you retrieve your  belongings? On what grounds?"</p><p>Ranma  shook his head. "He said that if he didn't keep my stuff, he  was afraid I'd just run away."</p><p>She  continued, "Can I assume your father said nothing about this?  Regardless, this simply will not do; to let Soun show such disrespect  to his future son in law is intolerable." She walked back  towards him, and, placing a hand on his shoulder she commanded,  "Ranma, you cannot allow him to dishonor you so, Father-in-law  or not. Coming here, as much as I enjoy the company, could be seen  by Mr. Tendo as confirming his theory."</p><p>"But  Mom," he started to complain, but was stopped when without  warning his aura flared uncontrollably, black as pitch and rolling  like a living shadow. A shock ran through his body like lightning,  paralyzing him as he felt a part of the aura flow painfully from him,  ripping away from him and forcing its way into his mother's hand as  if pulled by invisible ties.</p><p>She  emitted a terrified scream and yanked her hand away as the blackness  suddenly blazed into life. It expanded at an incredible rate,  throwing her across the room with a wave of concussive force to crash  into the sturdy wooden wall. She slumped to the floor, twitching  slightly with her eyes closed, as the aura shrank away to nothingness  almost as fast as it had appeared.</p><p>He  gaped for a moment, staring disbelieving at the scene before him as  he slowly rose to his feet. The disconnected feeling was soon  replaced with worry, prompting him to dash across the room to check  on her. He reached toward her but stopped just before contact,  afraid that his aura would only attack her again. "Mom... Oh  God... Mom, can you hear me? Mom?" he asked in tense voice.  His eyes widened as her aura shifted into view then begin to shift  and bend, the bright yellowish hue suddenly filled with swirling  brown and black tones.</p><p>Her  eyes flew open and she stared at him with wide eyes and fully opened  pupils, sucking in her breath sharply as she awoke. Slowly her eyes  returned to normal, but still she stared, not at but through him, as  if she was watching something that only existed in her mind. After  several long seconds she still had yet to say anything, but she  looked away from him to her hand, which she flexed into a fist and  then relaxed several times.</p><p>"Mom?   Are you okay?"</p><p>She  looked back at him, and lightly traced her fingers along his cheek,  studying his face as if seeing him for the first time. Slowly a  smile grew on her face. Not her usual peaceful, open smile, but  rather something slight, wry, and slightly... unnerving.</p><p>Ranma  flinched away when he felt her hand brush his cheek, attributing the  reaction to his fear of the aura yet again. "Mom?" he  asked, watching as intently as the discolored spots faded from view,  followed soon after by the rest of her chi.</p><p>She  stood up slowly, stretching her arms above her head and rolling her  shoulders and neck languidly. "Don't worry, Ranma. I'm fine."   She looked back at him with that same strange smile, though it  quickly melted away into her usual one. "I was just distracted  for a moment."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>"No  buts, Ranma, I'm fine. You didn't hurt me. In fact, I feel almost  refreshed suddenly." She turned away and headed for the door,  straightening her kimono as she walked. "Now stop acting so  worried and come down for breakfast. Afterwards you can go back to  Nerima and gather up your things."</p><p>He  watched her walk out, though he stayed rooted to the spot,  disbelieving what had just happened. He looked down at his hands,  studying them intently as he focused a small bit of chi to  materialize in the air between them. The glowing mass of light  swirled between his palms and slowly grew as he watched, but he was  disappointed and frustrated when it was only shown with yellow,  green, orange and finally reddish light, with no trace of the black.</p><p>"I  will conquer this thing. I will learn to control this power before  anyone else gets accidentally hurt by it," he swore to himself  angrily as he dispelled the chi harmlessly into the air. "And  then I'm going to find a way out  of this damned fiancée mess once and for all."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Kodachi  stepped out of the smooth black Nissan Skyline as one of her father's  subservients held the door for her. After adjusting her school  uniform, and internally grumbling about having to wear anything over  her custom-fit leotard even in public, she made her way towards the  front gates with determined steps and a not-entirely-friendly smile  upon her face. She rang the bell twice, then stood impatiently as  she awaited a greeting from the peasants who called this spacious but  extremely ill kept house and yard home.</p><p>"Oh,  how can I help you?" asked the eldest Tendo daughter as she  opened the door then offered a modest bow.</p><p>"I  would like to speak with Mr. Tendo Soun," Kodachi responded  coolly, without bothering to return the gesture. Her accompaniment,  a balding man in his late forties wearing a very professional looking  gray suit, a dark red tie, and carrying a black leather briefcase,  did bow slightly, despite her look of disdain.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled at the man, then turned back to Kodachi. "Well, he is  here, but we are in the middle of breakfast. Please, if you could  come inside and wait for just a few moments..."</p><p>"No,  I cannot wait," Kodachi interrupted. "I must be getting to  school soon and this is but the first of my errands for the  afternoon. I would very much like to have this matter cleared up  before I am forced to sit through such tedium."</p><p>"Well  if it's serious, Miss Kuno, I suppose Father could make an exception  for you," Kasumi replied as she stepped back and gestured them  in. "Please excuse the mess outside... Ranma had a bit of a  scuffle with one of his little friends a few nights ago. I'm sure  you understand."</p><p>"Hee  hee! Oh, so many silky darlings today!"</p><p>Kodachi  and the man quickly changed shoes and entered the home, following  their host's lead, all while pointedly ignoring the demented cackling  coming from the front room.</p><p>"Father,  you have guests," announced Kasumi as she reentered the family  room.</p><p>"Oh?"   Soun put his morning paper down and looked across the table to meet  Kodachi's level gaze.</p><p>"And  just what in the hell do you think you're doing here?" demanded  Akane. "Shouldn't you be off terrorizing Ranma or something?"</p><p>"Me,  incite terror in my love's heart? Oh, truly you are a simple girl to  think such things." Kodachi glanced about the room in search of  the aforementioned young male, but found only the Tendo family and  their amazingly well trained panda. "And where, pray tell, is  my heart's prince?"</p><p>"I  can answer that for, oh, lets say 2000 yen," Nabiki offered.</p><p>"If  you knew where he is, why didn't you tell me?" complained Akane.</p><p>"No,  I believe I will be more than capable of finding him on my own  initiative later this afternoon. I have more pressing matters to  discuss at present." Kodachi turned back toward Soun. "It  is my understanding that your family has arranged for a marriage of  one of your daughters to Saotome Ranma, but that you have yet to make  the engagement official with either a formal ceremony or the exchange  of a dowry, correct?"</p><p>"That  is true, though I too fail to see what interest of yours such details  are, Miss Kuno," replied her father with a hard tone.</p><p>"What  business of it is yours, Kodachi?" Akane demanded from behind  her.</p><p>"It  most certainly is my business, as you put it, because it seems that  your engagement is no longer of priority. I am now officially  engaged to Ranma, you see. A substantial amount of money was  delivered to Saotome Genma as a potential dowry several years ago,  sealing this transaction. Mr. Idoshi, the current acting manager of  the 2nd Nihon Bank of Nerima, can show you documentation of this  transaction if you so desire."</p><p>"Um,  hello," the man replied with a slightly nervous bow.</p><p>"I'd  like a look at that, for one," Nabiki said, eyeing the panda  that seemed to be attempting to sneak away from the room on the tips  of its back paws. "How about you, Mr. Saotome? Aren't you  curious to see if this is real?"</p><p>The  panda froze in mid step, then produced from... somewhere, a small  wooden sign reading "of course not, silly girl; pandas can't read."</p><p>Kodachi  blinked at the odd display that, truth be told, put her own efforts  at training her pet, Mr. Turtle, to shame. Perhaps they purchased the  animal from a circus? She blinked again as Akane ran off in angry  pursuit of the fleeing black and white blur, shouting all manner of  common, but colorful, phrases, the most curious of which was "What,  you ran out of food sources to trade him for?"</p><p>"This...   I think this actually is legitimate, Dad," admitted the  youngest Tendo girl still present with a soft tone. "It's been  stamped with his hanko and everything."</p><p>"Yes,  this is the original document, but we have several copies on file.  If you would like, I can have one mailed to your lawyer," Mr.  Idoshi offered.</p><p>"I  doubt that will be necessary," Kodachi said with slight  annoyance. "So now you see the crux of the matter, Mr. Tendo;  it seems that we are legally in a rather gray area concerning the  current status of our respective claims to Ranma."</p><p>She  snapped her fingers at Mr. Idoshi, who stepped forward and sat his  briefcase upon the table before Soun. "I have come to make a  compensatory offer, should you be willing to place your engagement  aside in this matter. Would ten million yen be sufficient?"</p><p>Knowing  where the decision-making power in the Tendo family really sat,  Kodachi glanced aside to watch the reaction of Nabiki to the offer  rather than Soun's. Predictably, Nabiki's eyes immediately bulged at  the prospect, but soon after her eyes turned downward with an almost  guilty or shameful expression that was wholly unexpected.</p><p>"I,  I don't know, I..." Mr. Tendo began to stammer as he stared at  the still-closed briefcase.</p><p>The  panda ran back through the room, with Akane close behind, and placed  another sign on the table as he passed, reading "Tendo my old  friend, think of the Art, of our friendship, and of the honorable  promise we made so many years ago!"</p><p>Kasumi  tossed the sign away quickly and kneeled by her father's side,  holding his had in both of hers. "Father, you should accept  this offer. With this money you could easily repair all the damages  that the house, dojo, and yard have suffered since the Saotomes'  arrival, and still have enough to fund a proper college education for  all three of your loving daughters."</p><p>"Kasumi,  how could you?" Nabiki whispered before raising her head to  offer her advice. "Dad, you can't do this. If you accepted  that money to ignore your honor and look the other way as she chases  Ranma, you would be no different than his father; an honorless,  greedy man who doesn't give a single thought to how his actions  affect the lives of others around him, so long as he manages to get  his own way."</p><p>Kodachi  smirked as Soun glanced back and forth between Nabiki, Kasumi, and  the briefcase with a bewildered look. A loud crash, followed by the  introduction of an unconscious panda to the room via a new hole in  the outer doors, caught his attention, however, and kept it on Akane  as she pushed aside the ruined screen and entered the room angrily.</p><p>"No,  you can't buy us off," Akane declared. "I've worked far  too long and put up with way too much shit on account of this  engagement idea of yours for you to just call it quits now. Ranma is  mine. I earned him with blood, sweat, and tears, and not you or  anyone else is going to take him from me now."</p><p>"Akane?"  Soun asked solemnly, "Do you really mean it? You definitely do  want to marry Ranma, even after what happened this weekend?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Soun  closed his eyes, and, after a moment's pause, he let out a breath  before pushing the case back towards Mr. Idoshi. "I have  considered your offer, Miss Kuno, but I feel I must decline it at  this time. Please, would you leave my family to its breakfast now?"</p><p>"If  you insist, Tendo-san, but don't expect another chance at my  generosity when Ranma chooses my love over that of your excessively  abusive spawn. Oh, and keep the case; Inside you will find exactly  400,000 yen, the compensation you requested for the damage to your  dojo." Kodachi reached into her pocket and retrieved a single,  crisply folded paper bill, placing it in front of Nabiki. "And  where was it that you mentioned I could find my one true love?"</p><p>"That's  not what you asked about earlier, but the answer is probably the  same," Nabiki replied as she pocketed the money before offering a  twisted smirk. "Frozen waist-deep in the deepest bowels of  Hell, I'd wager... but if you are referring to Saotome Ranma I  haven't the slightest idea."</p><p>Inside  she burned with rage at the glib little bitch, but Kodachi thought it  better to simply leave with her dignity intact and proceed to her  next target, Kuonji Ukyo, rather than waste more time on these  senseless and self-deluded fools.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Xian  Pu, I have a delivery for you to make!"</p><p>Shampoo  stopped her morning kata abruptly and stuck her head into the back  kitchen door to comment, "Can't Mu Tsu do it instead?"</p><p>Mousse  stopped his own practice abruptly, returning the feathered spear he  had been swinging in powerful arcs and short jabs back into the  mysterious recesses of his cloak. "Why me?" he complained  to the rusted trash bin, "I need my practice too, you know."</p><p>"What  you need are your glasses, idiot!" Shampoo roared as she kicked  him squarely in the back, launching him headlong into the trashcan he  somehow had mistaken was her.</p><p>"Xian  Pu..." he moaned, his voice muffled by the various rotting  foodstuffs and paper products crowded into the can with him. He  began kicking his legs in random directions, trying to free himself  from his confinement.</p><p>"Well  then, that settles this little issue, I suppose," Cologne  intoned. "He can't very well deliver anything if he's covered  in filth, now can he? Besides, I'd prefer for you to do handle this  one anyway."</p><p>Shampoo  groaned at her own stupidity as she ruefully accepted the duty. "But  it's only 7:30 in the morning, Great-Grandmother. Who in their right  mind orders carryout at this hour?" she complained.</p><p>"Someone  not in their right mind, perhaps? A fool in love?" replied  Cologne cryptically.</p><p>"Ha,  ha, ha... this is for that idiot, isn't it?" she asked flatly.</p><p>Cologne  admonished her quickly, "That idiot, as you call him, could very  well be your husband soon, Xian Pu. Remember that."</p><p>"Yes,  he will of course be my one and only right after he defeats Ranma,"  Shampoo replied sarcastically, "As if that were even the  slightest possibility. His art is too formal to be of any real use,  and he is so thick-headed that he still has yet to accept the truth  of Ranma's curse."</p><p>"He  seems to have trouble relating to reality sometimes?" asked  Cologne with one eyebrow raised.</p><p>"Yes,  Great-Grandmother. He acts like he's on a completely different world  then everyone else sometimes," she answered.</p><p>Cologne  muttered to herself with a far-off look, "That may be because he  is..."</p><p>"What?"  Shampoo asked, confused.</p><p>"Oh,  nothing to concern yourself with, child," the elder answered  evasively as her attention returned to the conversation at hand.  "Now head upstairs and take a shower. It wouldn't do for our  delivery girl to be all sweaty and smelling of garbage when she  arrives, would it?"</p><p>"But  won't the customer be mad if I don't bring his delivery quickly?"  Shampoo questioned half-heartedly.</p><p>"Why  would Son-In-Law-Number-Two be angry if you are late in delivering  food he did not order, Xian Pu?" the elder returned as she  hopped up onto a stool.</p><p>"You  mean... Great-Grandmother, why do you meddle in my life so?"  complained Shampoo as she sat down. "You act as if you actually  want me to marry  that fool."</p><p>"Perhaps  I do, although he is still my second choice so long as you have a  chance at convincing Ranma," she replied after a bit of thought.   "My meddling in your life is simply an old woman's prerogative,  my dear; symbolic revenge against the elders that meddled with my  life when I was your age. Just consider it advanced training for  when you yourself are an elder."</p><p>"Sometimes  I think you just stir up trouble in my life to stave off your own  boredom," Shampoo grumbled.</p><p>"Perhaps..."  the elder replied with a sly grin.</p><p>"But  why do you want to see me married to him?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"That  boy has tremendous untapped potential, Xian Pu," Cologne stated  simply. "Although his fighting technique is limited and his chi  seems slight, I feel that he has the potential to rival Ranma on the  field of battle if only he could learn to control his gifts... and  convinced that he actually has them, of course."</p><p>"Gifts?"  Shampoo wondered aloud.</p><p>"Did  you not notice his oddly distracted manner, or his piercing gaze?  The way his comments rang with truths he was not himself aware of?  That young man seems highly likely to have the gift of soul-sight,  the ability to see things as they are in purpose rather than in  form."</p><p>"Are  you kidding? That idiot doesn't' even realize that Ranma is  cursed!"</p><p>"Doesn't  see it, or doesn't acknowledge it?" the crone quipped. "Denial  is a powerful force in its own right, child. And in truth, Ranma  –does- somewhat act differently depending on his form."</p><p>"Are  you sure you're okay? Did you hit your head or something?"</p><p>"Do  not question me in such a disrespectful manner, Child," the  elder warned. "Slight jokes and informalities I can ignore and  even appreciate, but I will not tolerate you questioning my  judgment."</p><p>"Yes,  Great-Grandmother," the younger Amazon replied, averting her  gaze.</p><p>"Good,"  Cologne replied with a nod, then hopped up on her staff. "Now  go and freshen up while I finish the morning preparations."</p><p>After  a short but refreshingly hot shower, Shampoo dried herself then set  about choosing her clothing. At first she reached toward one of her  standard work outfits, a short white and green dress with slightly  faded colors, but she stopped. Perhaps Great-Grandmother was right;  no matter how unlikely it seemed that the stick-wielding fool could  ever defeat her beloved, the fact remained that for the time being  she should at least try to get to know him a little. With a resigned  sigh she reached instead for one of her fancier dresses, a royal blue  silk slip with a vertical line of light pink cherry blossom petals up  the side and intricate gold trim along the collar and hem.</p><p>Shampoo  returned to the lower floor with her hair still damp to find Cologne  waiting for her with a wrapped bundle and an approving nod. She accepted  the package and went to the kitchen to retrieve her bike.</p><p>"Stay  with the boy for a while, Child. There is more than enough here for  the both of you to share," the elder instructed. "Just  remember to come back in time to help with the lunch rush."</p><p>"Yes,  Elder. I'll go, but only because it is in the best interests of the  tribe," Shampoo replied as she walked her bike out the back  door. "It looks like rain, though. Can I have a packet of  Instant Nyannichuan?"</p><p>"Unfortunately,  no. A strange young man with wheels on his shoes offered a  ridiculously high price for them, so I sold him all that we had left.   I did put in an order for more, though," Cologne replied,  slightly apologetic. "You could try the waterproof soap."</p><p>"No,  that stuff always gives me a rash. Oh well, guess I'd better just be  careful, then," Shampoo replied. After placing the package in  the bike's basket, Shampoo rode off towards the school at a  relatively normal pace.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"...The  nerve of that girl, making us late to our meeting with Ranma, and the  way she interrupted us right in the middle of breakfast was very  rude, don't you think?"</p><p>When  Akane finally stopped to take a breath, the first in over a block,  Nabiki was quick to step in. "Yes, yes, I agree completely.  You don't have to tell me." Immediately she went back to  studying the figures in her notebook and tuning out any further  ranting from her riled-up sibling.</p><p>"And  I can't believe Kasumi said..." Akane trailed of as they neared  the school. "That had better not be what I think it is."</p><p>"Huh?"  asked Nabiki, looking ahead at the crowd of students before the  gates. At first glance they appeared completely normal, just a crowd  of random students waiting for classes to start. At second glance,  however, she noticed that all of the challengers were male, wearing  athletic equipment, and charging directly at them.</p><p>"With  Ranma gone, the game is back on!" one yelled.</p><p>"Boys!"  Akane yelled as if the word were a curse, tossing her bundle of  Ranma's clothes to Nabiki as she launched into a flying kick. She  pounded her way through the crowd with grim determination and an  array of quickly snapping punches and kicks. She broke their ranks  and pressed on into the middle of the crowd, attacking everyone  within range with a furious assault.</p><p>Nabiki  watched all this with a critical eye, noting that Akane was taking  more time to deal with each attacker than she had when this madness  had first occurred. Was Akane getting sloppy, or had the hentai  horde managed to improve? The answer seemed rather moot to her as  she watched a hockey player sneak up behind Akane unnoticed to land a  solid blow with his stick to the base of the skull.</p><p>Akane  tried to shake off the blow, but it had broken her rhythm enough for  her assailants to grapple her. She tried to throw them off but they  bore her to the ground with sheer numbers and pinned her.</p><p>"So  how's Saturday for you?" one of them called above the crowd.</p><p>"Hold,  curs! This display of brutality against purest womanhood shall not  go tolerated, not while the Blue Thunder yet lives!" Kuno  charged the group, swinging his weapon with fury and skill as he  cleared a path towards the pileup.</p><p>"But  it was your idea in the first place!" one student in a baseball  uniform complained as he was shouldered aside roughly.</p><p>"That  isn't important at the moment!" Kuno replied in a magnanimous  voice as Akane freed herself of the remaining assailants. "I  hereby declare that these attacks will cease, or you shall all face  my righteous blade!"</p><p>"Wait  just one second, there!" Nabiki demanded as the fight wound to a  stop. "You're going to just stop this stupidity? Not that I'm  complaining or anything, but still, it was all your idea to begin  with..."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Nabiki  was momentarily stunned by the simplistic answer, having expected to  be faced with the task of deciphering more of his usually convoluted  speech. At last, she managed to ask, "Yes?"</p><p>"Oh,  my head..."Akane groaned as she regained her footing. She took  up a defensive stance and challenged her would-be savior, "And I  suppose you want to go a round with me now, Kuno?"</p><p>"Nay,  good lady, I wish no contest with you this day, both in light of  your... accident, and in preparation for my duel," the kendoist  replied with a bow. "I was advised it would not do for me to be  overly tired when I face my enemy this final time."</p><p>"You  mean Ranma? Isn't he here yet?" asked Akane, still rubbing the  back of her head.</p><p>Setsuko  ran up from the stairs toward the sisters and Kuno, waving her arms  frantically. "Boss, I've been waiting for you for almost twenty  minutes!"</p><p>"I  was detained a bit by rather rude company," Nabiki replied  coldly.</p><p>"Well,  there's something you've got to know," Setsuko continued. "Ranma  got expelled!"</p><p>"He  what?" demanded Akane, grabbing the mousy girl by the shoulders.</p><p>"Akane,  killing my assistant won't get you any answers," Nabiki  admonished, leaning in close to her sister.</p><p>Setsuko  moved slightly away from Akane before continuing, "The principal  announced it a little after I got here. It was something about too  many absences, or tardiness, or something like that. He was kind of  vague."</p><p>Akane's  eyes widened then went dull as she looked at the entryway. "But  then... where is he now?" she whispered.</p><p>"Well,  Kuno, sounds like your challenge may go unanswered today,"  Nabiki smirked.</p><p>"Nay,  I know it shall not be wasted. This is the fated day of my triumph,  and even one such as he would not dare to disturb the way of things  by not answering my call," Kuno intoned gravely. "Even  now, I sense the approach of destiny."</p><p>Ding  ding!</p><p>Heralded  by her usual chime, Shampoo thundered out of the heavens on her  delivery bike, aligned to land precisely on the head of Kuno  Tatewaki. Much to everyone's surprise he remained standing, though  he stumbled back a few steps, as she balanced on only the front tire  before falling off his head to the ground.</p><p>"Nihao,  keyi-airen!" Shampoo sang rhythmically. "Wo xie ni liwu!"</p><p>"Youxiu!   Wo bi xiang tai pnzhi shiwu heshi dangshi wufan, wode liu cihua,"  He responded in kind as he accepted a small basket from her. "Mo  ru tang zan tan yi putong benzuyu, Xian Pu?"</p><p>"That's  just scary," Akane whispered, and Nabiki couldn't help but agree  as she suppressed the urge to shiver.</p><p>Shampoo  sighed, but nodded at his request. "Shampoo shall speak  Japanese when others be near."</p><p>"You  need not view this manner of speech as a chore," Kuno insisted,  taking her arm. "Rather, endeavor to reflect upon each sentence  as merely an opportunity for improvement and practice. But, for now,  let us away to continue this discussion far from the reach of  unenlightened ears."</p><p>Nabiki  watched Kuno walk away toward the school gates with Shampoo in an  almost romantic posture, and then turned to regard her associate.  "Setsuko?"</p><p>"I  haven't the slightest idea, boss," replied the younger girl with  a dumfounded  look.</p><p>"Pity,  but I think I want to investigate that situation on my own,"  Nabiki replied. "What I need you to do is to cancel any and all  bets for today, no matter what comes up. I've just got a sudden  feeling that today is going to be unusual all around, and I don't  think we need to lose money on wildly fluctuating odds."</p><p>"Right!"  Setsuko chimed as she ran off towards the school entrance.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Kasumi  wiped her hands off on her apron before taking it off and hanging it  on a hook by the doorway. She took a moment to mentally check off  every item she planned to serve, then, finding everything in order,  left the kitchen. She walked briskly down the hall to the family  room where she found, as expected, her father and Mr. Saotome (human  for a change) engaged in a discussion of the morning's events over a  game of Shoji.</p><p>"Lunch  is ready. Would you care for it here, or at the table?" she  asked simply.</p><p>"Hmm,  an interesting question, eh Saotome?" her father remarked with  unwarranted severity. "I believe that it will depend upon what  you have in mind,  Daughter."</p><p>It  was, of course, the same infuriating question that she was asked  every day. "I made some ham sandwiches, a light miso soup,  fresh lemonade, and a slice of watermelon for dessert," she  replied, maintaining her expected smile.</p><p>"Soup,  eh? I think that calls for the table, Tendo. Wouldn't want to soil  the game board, would we?" Genma replied with equally haughty  tone.</p><p>"Very  well then, we shall dine at the table this afternoon," Tendo  announced, turning to face her.</p><p>Genma  took the opportunity to not-so-subtly kick the table from below,  causing the majority of the dual-colored tiles to flip.</p><p>Soun  looked back at the loud thump, but was unable to spot the obvious  change in the board's layout even when tipped off by Genma's sudden  need to whistle and avoid eye contact. Suspicious, he continued his  speech while keeping an eye on things this time. "If you would  go ahead and set the table, Saotome and I will be in to eat just as  soon as our match and conversations are concluded."</p><p>"What  more is there to explain, Tendo?" Genma asked plaintively. "I  admit I made a mistake with the Kuno girl, but that was several years  ago. Besides, It was all for the good of the school... you wouldn't  hold that against me, would you?"</p><p>"Yes,  Father," she replied with false cheerfulness before returning to  the kitchen.</p><p>She  grumbled under her breath as she grabbed two bowls of soup, but was  interrupted midway to the table by a loud knock upon the front door.  Nearly screaming in exasperation when her father looked at her  expectantly rather than moving to answer the door himself, she  managed to control her temper and maintain her vacant smile long  enough to place the bowls on the table and exit the room. Perfect, a  guest was just the last thing she needed today, one more mouth to  feed without so much as a thank you or a bit of help with the dishes  afterwards.</p><p>Kasumi  was thus primed and ready when she opened the door, after a second  burst of impatient knocking, to find Ranma standing on the walkway.  She flinched at the unexpected sight, but soon steeled herself to  demand, "What do you want?"</p><p>Ranma  was surprised at how bluntly hostile Kasumi was acting, but quickly  set his shoulders in a proud posture. "I've come to retrieve my  property, Kasumi. If you'll just step aside I'll pack up my things  and leave quietly."</p><p>"No,  you won't," she replied harshly. "You're going to turn  around and march out the gate. In case you've forgotten, you are not  welcome in this home for the time being."</p><p>"I  didn't forget. I just ain't leaving this time without my stuff,  like it or not," he responded tersely with a raised voice.</p><p>"Kasumi,  who is at the door?" asked her father as he came around the  corner with Genma in tow.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled, but with a sharp light in her eyes. "It seems that  Ranma is skipping his classes for the afternoon, Father."</p><p>"Boy,  why aren't you in school?" Genma demanded, lumbering his way  towards the entryway.</p><p>"I  don't have classes anymore, Pop. I got expelled," Ranma replied  matter-of-factly.</p><p>"What?"  Genma howled, pushing Kasumi slightly aside as he stormed up to the  door and gripped Ranma's shirtfront. "Do you have any idea what  your mother will say when she learns of this disgrace?"</p><p>Ranma  casually gripped his father's wrist and, applying sharp pressure to a  nerve cluster as he twisted his grasp, forced the grip on his  clothing to release. "Already told her, and she didn't get  that mad at all. I'm going to be movin' in with her for a while."</p><p>"But  what about Akane? Do you plan to neglect her again while you are  gone?" Soun asked as he joined Genma in the entryway, blocking  Kasumi completely out.</p><p>"Who  said anything about neglect? You're the one who tossed me out,  remember?" Ranma demanded.</p><p>"Well,  I suppose I did act a bit rashly, perhaps. You may return to living  here again, provided you fix the damage to the yard and wall with  your new free time," Soun replied.</p><p>"Father,  no!" Kasumi complained, grabbing his shoulder to get his  attention. "It's no wonder Ranma shows us so little respect,  considering you bow down so quickly whenever he complains. It's only  been two nights since you  enacted this punishment!"</p><p>"No  problem, I'd rather move out for now anyways... let things cool down  around here a bit," Ranma stated as he entered the home behind  Soun's turned back. Without waiting for a reply, he dashed up the  stairs, leaving his shoes to fall carelessly to the floor.</p><p>"There,  do you see it? He came back in without being invited, and didn't  even bother to put his shoes up properly!" Kasumi pouted,  pointing at the floor.</p><p>Soun  ignored her, turning to his friend who was rubbing idly at his wrist.   "I don't like this, Saotome. I think we should keep Ranma here  to ensure that he and Akane don't grow farther apart again."</p><p>"Agreed,  old friend. Let me try and talk some sense into the boy," Genma  intoned confidently before he lumbered up the steps as well.</p><p>"Father,  why do you want him to stay here?" Kasumi asked in a pleading  tone. "He has shown time and time again that he is incapable of  showing proper respect to us, and he is a walking disaster area! It  would be better for us all if he were to simply leave."</p><p>"Kasumi,  why are you so adamant about this?" Son asked, concerned. "Do  you not realize that if he leaves then the engagement between Akane  and could become even more strained than it is now?"</p><p>"Father,  there is almost no chemistry between them as it is! Akane is merely  fixated on the competition for his hand, and Ranma feels only  annoyance with all his pursuers," she explained, ignoring the  sounds of a scuffle upstairs. "It's not just that though...  every time I seen him lately I get a really bad feeling, like if I  don't get him out of here something terrible is going to happen."</p><p>"But  what if something terrible happens while Ranma isn't around to  help?" Soun retorted. "I'm sure that the more time he  spends with us the greater our chances of convincing him to marry  Akane willingly become. His honor will ensure that he chooses  correctly in the end."</p><p>"His  honor? Father, I don't see what honor it is that you're referring  to. He disobeys your rules and the laws of the country. He lies,  cheats, and steals anything and everything that can help him with his  martial arts. He argues with Akane constantly, disrupting the  harmony of the home. He encourages other ill-mannered hooligans to  invade our home at all hours of the day and night to fight him. He  pays no heed to the damage to our property and reputation his antics  cause," Kasumi stopped to take a breath, hardening her voice for  the final charge. "Please, Father, he has to go. Just think of  how he dishonors Mother's memory, by destroying her shrine, by not  making any effort to repair the damage, or even taking the time to  apologize to her. Then again..."</p><p>A  heavy, meaty thump on the floor behind her gave Kasumi pause. She  turned to find Genma lying unconscious in a heap. Ranma stood behind  him at the  foot of the stairs, with a stuffed backpack over one shoulder and a  grim expression on his face.</p><p>"Don't  stop on my account, he requested with a cold, hard voice. "Go ahead  and finish your sentence, Kasumi."</p><p>She  finished her statement without removing her eyes from Ranma. "Then  again, perhaps you're somehow blinded to it, Father. You are after  all friends with his father, who, were he a bit less lazy, would be  just as bad as his son."</p><p>"Kasumi,  this is uncalled for! You have insulted both of our guests with your  unwarranted accusations!" Mr. Tendo cried, grabbing her  shoulder and turning her to face him. "What has come over you  lately?"</p><p>"Don't  blame her, Mr. Tendo. She has her opinions, and they are just as  true as anybody else's, I suppose. I'll be going now," Ranma  stately flatly, stepping over his father's prone form.</p><p>She  stepped behind him as he left. "Good! Leave, and never darken  this door again, you honorless bastard!"</p><p>"Kasumi,  you will stop this behavior at once! Your actions bring dishonor  upon both our family names!" Soun shouted with anger and a  touch of fear.</p><p>Ranma  paused in his step, then turned to regard her with dangerously  hardened eyes as his aura began to manifest itself visibly as a dark  shroud.</p><p>She  flinched at the sight, but felt even more determined to get him out  of the home, one way or another. "Are you still here?"</p><p>The  floorboards in contact with his blazing aura began to smolder and ash  as he stood silently, staring her down. At length he threatened,  "Would ya like me to teach your daughter some manners, Mr.  Tendo?"</p><p>She  smirked at his lack of a defense and against her comments, but was  surprised when her father pulled her roughly aside by her arm and  clamped a hand firmly over her mouth. She struggled against his grip  as Ranma walked out the door, but he held her stiffly until the front  door shut with a faint click.</p><p>"Father!"  she demanded with her fists clenched, "how could you take his  side?"</p><p>Soun  slapped her across the face in response, hard enough to slightly  stagger her. He turned his face from her as he decreed, "You  shame me, Daughter. Go to your room, and stay there until I decide  what to do about," he glanced at the singed floor meaningfully,  "this."</p><p>Stunned,  she held her hand against her reddening cheek and stared at him, but  he would not return her gaze. With bitter tears on her face and  desperate anger in her heart, she spat, "Enjoy your lunch,  Father," before turning and running up the stairs.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Hibiki  Ryoga was lost.</p><p>This  was nothing out of the ordinary, but it annoyed him nevertheless,  especially since he was actually trying to get to the bathroom. The  reduced bladder size of his cursed form seemed incredibly  inconvenient at times.</p><p>The  sound of the doorbell vaguely registered in his mind, but was mostly  ignored as he continued his four-legged pee-pee dance aimlessly  through the Tendo home. The sound of Ranma's voice was unexpected,  though, and sneaking towards the argument in progress was enough to  make him momentarily forget his physical distress.</p><p>He  reached a passable vantage point from the top of the staircase (wait,  wasn't the bathroom supposed to be on the ground floor?) just in time  to see Ranma slip past Kasumi and come barreling up the stairs  towards him. Not prepared to face Ranma again, much less in this  form, he turned and ran into the first open door he saw only to  discover that he was now in Ranma's room. With a squeal he dove into  the only reasonable hiding place, burrowing beneath the sheets as  Ranma entered the room, grumbling.</p><p>Ryoga  froze, watching intently from his hiding space as Ranma quickly  packed all of his clothes and belongings into his well-worn traveling  pack. Was Ranma leaving for good, finally stepping aside so that he  could finally have a chance with Akane? No, Ranma was far too  possessive for that. Even with his ever-growing harem, Ranma would  never allow anyone to gain a bit of happiness under his nose.</p><p>"Stop,  Boy, and think about what you're doing."</p><p>Ryoga  turned slightly to notice Genma enter the room, just far enough to  effectively guard the door.</p><p>Ranma  gave a snort, but continued his packing. "I know exactly what  I'm doin', Pop; I'm taking a vacation from my screwed-up life.  Things are getting way too hectic lately, what with Saffron, the  wedding, and all the rest. I need a break, a chance to clear my  head."</p><p>"Boy...   Son, if you walk out that door we both know you won't want to come  back," Genma said with uncharacteristic softness. "I know  I'm probably the last person qualified to say this, but if you don't  stay here and face down your problems, your relationship with Akane  will never improve."</p><p>"As  if you really care..." Ranma replied as he tied the pouch  closed. "If you really cared about me and Akane you wouldn't  have engaged me to three different girls. I found out about Kuno  Kodachi, by the way."</p><p>"I  only did that as collateral, boy, to get enough money to support our  trip, err, most of it anyway," Genma explained. "Would you  have rather I'd put up the house, and risked leaving your mother  homeless and alone? It was all for the art, boy, all for you."</p><p>"All  for the art I buy, but I don't think you've ever done anything all  for me," Ranma replied with sadness and anger. "You never  really cared for me as anything other than a tool of the art, as a  bargaining chip, or as a scapegoat. If you did, you wouldn't be  trying to force me to marry someone I don't love, all for the sake of  the school."</p><p>"Foolish  boy, you don't even begin to comprehend the gifts I've given you, the  risks I've taken and sacrifices I've made to make you the best man I  could," Genma stated defensively, glowering until he caught his  anger and forced it down. "Ranma, even if you don't love her  now you will grow to love her in time, when all the complications of  other fiancées are gone. We both know that deep down Akane is  a very sweet girl and that she cares for you. Just give her a chance  and I'm sure she'll make you a happy man."</p><p>"Is  she really such a catch, pop? Sure, every once in a while she's  pretty nice, and cute, but most of the time she's a complete pain in  the ass to be around," Ranma stated, hefting his bag. "It's  not enough, Pop. Those moments are too short and too rare to make up  for the rest of her."</p><p>Ranma  moved towards the door, but Genma refused to budge. "I already  told you that I can't let you leave, Ranma."</p><p>"Well  then you've got a problem, because you can't keep me here either,"  Ranma stated, settling into a modified horse stance. "I can go  through the door or I can go through you and the door, Pop; your  choice."</p><p>Genma  took up a stance as well, rooting himself firmly to defend the  doorway. "There is only one choice, Boy."</p><p>Ranma  wasted no more words, charging his father with a vicious kick. Genma  blocked and countered, and so continued the never-ending battle  between father and son. Ranma's backpack slowed him down a bit, but  Genma, forced to defend  a position, was unable to really capitalize on this.</p><p>They  tossed attacks back and forth, never scoring a clean hit, until Genma  at last resorted to his special techniques. "Jigoku no  Yurikago!" He cried, leaping towards Ranma with outstretched  hands. Ranma leapt backwards to avoid the grappling technique,  forcing Ryoga to abandon his hiding place for the relative safety of  the closet.</p><p>"Not  this time, Pop. Try that move again and I guarantee you'll regret  it," Ranma threatened.</p><p>Genma  paused, then snickered a bit. "Oh really? Let's see what you  think you've got, boy! Jigoku no Yurikago!"</p><p>Ranma  leaned back, crossing his arms before him as if to defend, but right  as Genma descended onto him he raised his right leg, screaming "Kachu  Tenshin Ashige!" as his leg blurred into a frenzy of powerful  kicks to Genma's exposed abdomen and chest, concentrated on his  diaphragm.</p><p>"See?   That stupid move leaves you wide open to a quick attack, pop,"  Ranma commented, advancing on his father's kneeling form, gasping  deeply to regain his breath. As Genma looked up slightly Ranma  dashed forward, kneeing the fallen man in the face hard enough to  launch him through the door and down the stairway. "All too  easy..." Ranma sighed as he leapt down the stairs as well.</p><p>At  last Ryoga crept out of hiding and made his way, after four wrong  turns in the house, a brief sojourn through the yard and a across the  street, to a bathroom. One leap into a furo and a much-needed use of  the facilities later, he was back on the street.</p><p>Ryoga  began wandering about town randomly, paying attention only to the  daydreams that sprang up all around him. Ranma had all but invited  him to take Akane off his hands! Now all he had to do was to break  the news to Akane gently, deflecting all the blame for the  relationship's failings to Ranma, of course, and then act the part of  the concerned friend. Akane would surely fall for him and then all  would be right in the world!</p><p>All  he had to do to accomplish his goal now was to actually find Akane.  Unfortunately for him, he had no idea where the school actually  was... not that such knowledge would have helped much, really. Now  he found himself somewhere in Nerima, wandering aimlessly through a  market filled with unfamiliar faces.</p><p>"Sweeto,  a garter belt!"</p><p>He  turned on his heels towards the shout, watching as a small black blur  danced through the crowds, flipping up skirts as it ran. Anger  welled up in his heart at the sight, and, patiently waiting for the  figure to immerge, he prepared to strike.</p><p>Suddenly  the blur was past the last of the women and emerged from cover only  to be met with an unexpected fist, pounding elbow-deep into the concrete-paved  street.</p><p>"That's  some punch you've got there, sonny," commented Happosai from his  new perch on Ryoga's head, "But you have to actually land it  before that power will do you any good." He bounced away as the  lost boy reached for him, evading capture.</p><p>"I'll  land one eventually you old bastard!" Ryoga yelled, "And  then another, and another, until you've paid for stealing my cure!"   He leapt to the rooftops, keeping pace.</p><p>"Yours?   Funny, I was under the impression that the water belonged to Ranma,"  Happosai merrily remarked, weaving between attacks and across the  roofs with little effort.</p><p>"That  doesn't matter now!" Ryoga yelled, tossing a few bandanas.</p><p>Happosai  casually dove between them. "Your right, it never mattered in  the first place. That cursed water wouldn't have done anything but  kill you, boy."</p><p>"You  lying bastard! Shi-Shi Hokodan!" Ryoga screamed, throwing a  fairly large blast of chi at the difficult-to-hit master.</p><p>Happosai  reached into his shirt for his pipe, then spun it around his fingers  as the blast approached. With a flick of the wrist he intercepted  the blast, then with an almost casual spin on the tips of his toes he  redirected the blast back along the same path it had followed to him.</p><p>Ryoga  blinked twice at this, then quickly raised his arms in defense as his  own attack slammed into him. He leaned forward against the attack  and tensed his muscles, fighting against it's momentum, but his  footing gave and he was overwhelmed. The attack threw him across the  tiles and left him half embedded into the roof's rising slope,  slightly singed.</p><p>"Such  language... Youngsters these days have no sense of gratitude,"  the old man complained as he hopped over and bopped Ryoga on the head  with his pipe. "That was Jusenkyo water all right, but it  didn't have a curse yet. All you would have accomplished by pouring  that on yourself would have been to create a new cursed pool, er,  puddle. You should be glad I was there to dispose of it harmlessly"</p><p>"If  that's true, why did you seem surprised when it wasn't sake?"  Ryoga countered.</p><p>"Why,  um, that's because..." Happosai began, but broke off as he  weaved between two tentacle swipes and a snapping pincer.</p><p>Ryoga  quickly turned his head to behold a huge, somewhat familiar looking  creature glaring menacingly at the old master with golden, vertically  slit eyes. The beast was nearly five meters tall and three and a  half meters wide at the shoulder, a hulking form mostly covered by a  thick orange and black striped pelt. It's feet, thick cloven hooves,  did not touch the roof as it hovered slightly above the damaged  surface, kept aloft by the rhythmic beating of two large  gray-feathered wings. Its chest was protected by a glossy-finished  black shell, and its arms ended in matching long, curved pincers.  Its head was rather bovine-like with long whitish horns, from which a  gray-scaled, ribbed hood extended to join with its thick neck. The  same scales covered its abdomen and knees, small armored islands in a  sea of fur. From its back extended four long purple tentacles, each  tipped with a menacing looking barb, and a single grayish-green tail  ending in a snapping-jawed head, all of which flailed around it in an  almost hypnotic display.</p><p>"Pantyhose,  my boy! My, you've changed since last we met... still playing in the  springs I see." The old man looked the creature over from horns  to hooves once, nodded to himself, and then ran like a man possessed.</p><p>"Hrrpooarrrsssii!"  The thing roared, flying off in pursuit of the diminutive pervert.</p><p>"Hey,  I'm not done with you yet!" Ryoga yelled, shaking himself loose  of the debris and joining the chase.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Do  you like it?"</p><p>He  turned to regard the lavender-haired girl next to him as he finished  his first bite of her offered wares. The noodles still retained  substantial forms, as if not cooked fully. The sauce was salty and  sweet, though perhaps a bit too watery for his liking. The minced  mushrooms could have been fresher, but the onions were perfect. All  in all, the food was... adequate. "But of course I like it,  Xian Pu. How could anything delivered from your personage be less  then perfection itself?"</p><p>Shampoo  looked away from the kendoist as she replied, "Great-Grandmother  always makes the sauce too weak and the noodles have gotten a little  stale."</p><p>"True  enough, but I would challenge the word of anyone who claimed they  were able to create a more enjoyable meal from such stock as you  used," he answered with a prideful smirk. "I would punish  them as blasphemers, and force them to repent their wicked lies set  against your comestibles."</p><p>"You  would do such a thing for the honor of an inferior product?" she  asked with an annoyed tone. "Perhaps you are as foolish as I  first thought."</p><p>"For  your honor, I would," he replied sagely, "and if that makes  me a fool, so be it."</p><p>"You  don't mean that any more than Mu Tsu does," Shampoo replied with  a slight frown. "You don't even know me."</p><p>He  paused for moment in thought, then, studying her face intently for  the lightest hint of her true feelings, he answered, "a wise man  once said 'a truth, once known, requires no further proof of its  veracity. The light of its nature will so shine forth unto his very  being that to deny it would be to deny his own soul."</p><p>"And  what is that supposed to mean?" she asked neutrally, her eyes  widening a bit... with hope?</p><p>"It  means that I love you, Xian Pu," he confessed. "Before we  were brought together by fate it was as if I were trapped in a fog,  with only the distant voices of liars to guide my way."</p><p>She  shook her head negatively, and argued without meeting his gaze, "You  didn't even know my name before last night. You're just another  love-sick fool like all the boys back in my village."</p><p>"Yet  today it is as if the fog is gone," he whispered as he gently  turned her head by the chin to meet his gaze, "When I look into  your eyes, I feel I can finally see clearly what it is that I want.  For the first time in as long as I can remember the only voice I hear  in my mind is my own."</p><p>She  held his gaze for a moment, searching the depths of his gray eyes,  but abruptly snapped her eyes shut pulled away from him, clenching  her fist. "You don't even know what love is. Just yesterday  you were entranced by Tendo Akane and your 'pigtailed girl.' You  don't love anyone; you're just a fool in love with love itself."</p><p>His  conscience burned, dragging him bound through pits of fiery shame as  he confronted her words. It was true, every word of it. He had  fallen prey to obsession, not love, and had pursued his prey with all  his might, until at last he chased them far from his grasp. Yet  somehow, in a way he still couldn't put properly into words, he felt  something different towards this girl before him. His honor demanded  he protect her, her laws demanded he wed her, but his heart demanded  nothing but patience and understanding.</p><p>"Captain!"  Sato Toji, the head of the underclassman kendo squad, interrupted in  Japanese as he approached, "Saotome has arrived!"</p><p>"Excellent!   Lead me to him, then tend to the preparations," he commanded.</p><p>"How  will you ensure that he will accept your terms?" Toji asked.</p><p>"He  will accept them, for his pride will not allow otherwise. I will  challenge him as stated because of the words of the eternally wise  Sun Tsu: Those skilled in war bring the enemy to the field of battle  and are not brought there by him."</p><p>Kuno  turned on Shampoo with a determined look and informed her in  Japanese, "You may have doubts about our future, but I shall set  your heart free. I go now to challenge Saotome Ranma, and with the  strength of your love and a mind clear of distraction surely I shall  defeat him for your hand."</p><p>"You  wait a second, Shampoo is not understanding! You challenge other  airen now?" she asked, chasing him as he ran off, led by the  younger student.</p><p>"That  is what I intend, yes," he replied in a questioning tone.</p><p>"Challenge  no be official unless elder watch," she replied, breaking off  and heading for the fence. "Shampoo must get  Great-Grandmother!" He smiled at her obvious eagerness to see  him victorious as he followed his subordinate to the front gates  where, as reported, Saotome Ranma was just passing through, ignoring  the curious crowd of students.</p><p>"Didn't  you get expelled?" asked a curious girl.</p><p>"You're  here to kill the principal, right?" hoped a younger boy with a  shaved head.</p><p>As  he approached, a feeling of wrongness pervaded his mind, far stronger  than ever before around the sorcerer, not simply in terms of his  almost palpable evil but through subtle and mundane cues as well.  For one, Saotome was not running or falling out of the sky as he  entered the grounds, but rather stomping in a slow but determined  gait. With clenched fists and an iron-hard glare Ranma appeared the  very picture of wrath, yet he did not seem to affix that displeasure  to anyone at all, as if the feelings his outlook betrayed were  directed elsewhere.</p><p>For  one brief moment, Kuno nearly lost his nerve, but the thought of  facing Shampoo and her elder without a challenge to witness forced  all such foolishness from his mind. With courage and decorum, he  approached his target, only to be punched aside before he uttered  even a single word.</p><p>"I'm  not in the mood, Kuno," Ranma remarked offhandedly as he  continued toward the doors. The crowd began to spread apart after  the casual display of violence.</p><p>"Have  you so little honor, Saotome, that you will not even wait until after  I have presented my challenge to attack?" Tatewaki demanded,  righting himself.</p><p>Ranma  stopped and turned to face him. "You wanna challenge me?"</p><p>"Yes,  I..." He began, but was cut off abruptly by yet another uncalled  for attack, leaving him partially embedded in the wall.</p><p>"You  lose," Ranma stated simply, then turned back toward the gates  and reached for the door handle.</p><p>"You  have not yet heard my challenge, fiend!" the kendoist cried as  he freed himself from the shattered debris.</p><p>Ranma  stopped once again, and, more slowly than last time, turned back yet  again. "Fine, go ahead and talk all you want. Just let me know  when it's time to maim you," he announced, then began cracking  his knuckles methodically, one joint at a time, while staring at Kuno  unblinkingly.</p><p>"It  has come to my attention that you are in the habit of conforming to  the style of many of your opponents, such as a skating match at that  occurred some time ago." Tatewaki looked to his opponent for  confirmation, but, finding none, continued. "In all this time,  not once have we crossed within my chosen field of combat, Kendo. It  just so happens that I have arranged for all the necessary equipment  and officials to be present, and have them waiting in the gymnasium  at this very moment."</p><p>Ranma  blinked, then grabbed Kuno's collar and pulled him face to face.  "Let me get this straight... You want to challenge me to a  fight using your stupid stick-fighting crap? And you honestly think  that this will make even the slightest difference in the outcome?"</p><p>"Today  is the day you fall, demon, and your evil soul will be revealed  before all," Tatewaki replied confidently.</p><p>"Fine  then, I'll accept your terms just this once." Ranma released  his grip with a smirk. "I was on my way to get something out of  my gym locker anyway."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Look,  I told you already that I don't need this crap," Ranma stated,  staring down the other boy. "You want me to wear these silly  black pajamas, fine, but I don't need any stupid armor. It's not  like the idiot could hurt me, even if he did manage to hit me, which  he won't."</p><p>"And  as I told you, it isn't up for discussion," Sato replied,  hefting the protective jacket in question with obvious effort. "The  rules explicitly state that all participants must wear all of the  proper protective gear, so unless you want to forfeit this match I  suggest you let me walk you through putting this 'crap' on."</p><p>"Fine  then," Ranma grumbled, sliding his arms through the appropriate  holes as his classmate held it out for him. "Geez, is it  supposed to be this heavy? This thing must weigh at least three  hundred kilos. Stupid thing gets in the way of my arms, too."</p><p>"It's,  um," Toji paused as he circled around to Ranma's back and began  to lace up the chest plate, "supposed to, ah, simulate the  weight of the armor that samurai traditionally war into battle."</p><p>"But  that's stupid!" Ranma rebuked. "Sure, they needed to wear  armor in an open battlefield to protect them from attacks by  opponents from all angles, but this is a one-on-one fight so all it  does is slow you down."</p><p>"There  are rules to this art, Saotome, and the sooner you realize that the  better your chances to actually give the Captain the showdown he  craves." Toji finished tying the laces with a final hard tug,  and came back into Ranma's view. "I'll begin to explain them  while you put on the rest of the equipment."</p><p>"It's  fairly simple, isn't it? Hit with the stick and stay in bounds."  Ranma stated, annoyed, as he began to lace up one of his thickly  padded gloves,  noting the excessive weight of it's sewn-in armor plates as well.</p><p>Toji  sighed as he laced up the other glove. "Kendo is a much deeper  art form of strategy, tactics, and skill then that, Saotome, but  essentially you are correct."</p><p>"Great  then, let's go get this over with." Ranma grabbed his helmet  and followed the other boy out into half-filled gym.</p><p>He  strode confidently towards the marked arena, where his opponent stood  waiting for him attended by the rest of the Furinkan kendo team and  several uniformed judges. Surveying the audience as he stepped to  the marked arena, he noted the presence of Akane, Ukyo, and Nabiki  without surprise, but seeing Cologne and Shampoo here as well  slightly unnerved him. All but Cologne cheered as he stepped into  the ring.</p><p>"Are  you prepared, Saotome?" asked Mr. Namura, the P.E. coach. When  Ranma nodded, he walked behind him and pulled slightly at the lacing  of his chest guard. "I am marking you as red for scoring  purposes," he explained.</p><p>"Always  been my favorite color," Ranma replied. Seeing Kuno's back  being marked with a white ribbon, he approached his rival and  offered, "Since I won't be back to this school again, how about  we place a bit of a wager on the outcome of this fight, just to tie  things up between us?"</p><p>"Indeed,  I would not oppose such a request, were it made reasonably,"  Kuno replied.</p><p>"Well  then, how about this? If I win, your family calls of this engagement  business between Kodachi and me."</p><p>Kuno  shook his head firmly. "Nay, that I cannot abide. My sister's  affairs are not mine to wager on. I suggest that when I am  victorious you shall  remove your enchantments from every girl under your dark  compulsions."</p><p>"I  can't remove what ain't there. How about if I win, you vow to leave  Akane and the pig-tailed-girl alone?" Ranma tried again.</p><p>"You  know, it isn't very wise to place wagers right in front of the  judges, boys," Mr. Namura said from behind as he finished the  knot.</p><p>Ranma  bristled for a moment, but then remembered to whom it was he was  talking. "Fine, forget it then. Lets just get this started  already."</p><p>"Are  the contestant's ready?" asked Mr. Namura as he took the  position of head referee.</p><p>"Yeah,  whatever."</p><p>"Verily."</p><p>"Then  take your positions, and on my signal, begin."</p><p>Ranma  fell into a slightly crouching stance, holding his weapon with one  hand to his side and pointing forward. He held this pose for several  seconds, eying his opponent. When the signal did not come after  nearly 15 seconds of motionless concentration, he glanced at the  referee to see what the trouble was.</p><p>"Mr.  Saotome, you must begin in the proper stance," Mr. Namura  explained, gesturing towards Kuno.</p><p>With  a sigh, Ranma forced himself to take on the stiff-feeling posture  that Kuno held, standing straight upright with his feet slightly  apart and his  shinai held before him with both hands. As soon as the signal was  given, he stepped back and into his former stance, easily avoiding  Kuno's opening horizontal strike.</p><p>For  a few brief moments they traded blows, testing the defenses of the  other, until Ranma spun around a downward strike to contact with  Kuno's temple strongly. The bamboo staff shattered with the impact,  and his opponent was knocked to the ground just barely within the  arena's limits.</p><p>"Halt!"</p><p>Ranma  waited as one of the two sub-referees handed him a new weapon and his  opponent regained his footing, taking up the same stance in the  middle of the arena yet again. With a smirk, Ranma took his place.</p><p>"Begin!"</p><p>There  was no testing period this time, as Ranma attacked immediately,  knocking his opponent's guard away with several quick blows to once  again break his weapon across Kuno's temple, from the other side this  time.</p><p>"Halt!"</p><p>"Well  that was easy," Ranma said, handing the broken handle to the  waiting sub-referee. He was surprised, however, when it was replaced  with another.</p><p>"Hey,  what gives? I won, right?" he demanded.</p><p>"Won?   Mr. Saotome, you have yet to score even one point. In fact, if you  break one more shinai I will dock you a point for un-sportsmanlike  conduct. Now take your position and fight properly! Begin!"</p><p>Ranma's  mouth fell from a smirk to a hard line as the match began again. He  began to fight more defensively, paying more attention to an internal  replay of the information he had been given than to the actions of  his opponent.</p><p>At  first, it was all Kuno could do to keep his defense up, slowly giving  ground as Ranma attacked relentlessly. He parried the brunt of the  attack, but was forced to slowly give ground until he was pushed to  the edge of the ring. Ranma attacked with a final strong blow, and  though Kuno managed to parry it, he was forced to move his left foot  back to maintain his balance.</p><p>Ranma  immediately backed up after the attack and pointed his shinai at  Kuno. "There, he stepped outside the ring! Point for me!"  he declared.</p><p>Mr.  Tamura shook his head, cleared his throat nervously, and then  answered, "No, Mr. Saotome, you did not. Mr. Kuno's foot did  not completely cross the foul line, and if it had I would have  penalized you a point for unfair pushing."</p><p>"What  do you mean? I hit him fair and square!" Ranma demanded.</p><p>"The  referee's ruling on the court is final!" Mr. Tamura declared.  The other referee's looked at him oddly, but made no comment.</p><p>"Begin!"</p><p>Ranma  circled his opponent for several minutes, trading blows at a frantic  place without either scoring a telling blow as he continued to ponder  the situation. For over a minute after realizing that he was simply  missing some piece of information, he began to strike in different  locations, pulling his attacks to avoid breaking the weapon, but to  no avail. Finally acting out in annoyance, Ranma stepped back and  dropped his guard completely.</p><p>With  a sudden shout, his opponent's weapon swung forcefully toward his  neck, and Ranma only smiled as the blow connected.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Hey  Nabiki! What are the odds on Ranma for this fight?" Ukyo asked,  running towards the Tendo in question while waving a fist full of  bills. Even if the payout wasn't that great, Ranma's sure victory  over Kuno could help a little to ward off having to make a certain  dreaded call back home.</p><p>"Sorry,  Ukyo, all bets are closed. Might as well have a seat and watch the  fight with us, though," Nabiki replied, motioning towards  several empty spots on the bench next to her younger sister. "Hoping  to pay back your debts with winnings from me? Not likely."</p><p>"Damn  it," she muttered, annoyed at being read so easily. She caught  Akane's glance, noting the lingering anger that was still directed at  her.</p><p>Nabiki  glanced back and forth between the two other girls before scooting  next to her sister, leaving Ukyo room to set apart from the angry  girl.</p><p>"Any  idea why Ranma is even here, Nabiki? I heard that he was expelled  yesterday," Ukyo asked, prompting Akane to smolder slightly for  an unknown reason  and turn away abruptly. "And what is her problem?" she  whispered.</p><p>"No  idea, on either count," Nabiki admitted. "To be honest,  I'm still puzzled over how Kuno managed to set all this up without my  knowledge. I've just had a weird feeling all day though, and that's  why there is no betting: Just in case something unpredictable  happens. You understand, of course."</p><p>"Yeah,  I understand," Ukyo sighed. She completely understood that in  any situation involving too much unpredictability Nabiki would not  allow others to profit at her expense.</p><p>"I  trust you won't mind our company?" asked Cologne as she pogoed  to a stop next to Ukyo, with Shampoo in tow. "These appear to  be rather good seats for the upcoming challenge."</p><p>"You're  here to watch the fight?" Akane asked abruptly, while putting  the pieces together in her head. "And Shampoo has been hanging  around Kuno all afternoon and acting weird in general... They must  have some crazy plan using Kuno to force Ranma to go back to China!"   Akane stood up and pointed an accusing finger at the elder.</p><p>Cologne  only chuckled slightly. "Calm yourself, child. Your paranoia  is charming to an extent, but in this matter it is woefully  misplaced. I assure you that I only learned of this challenge a few  moments ago myself."</p><p>"That  doesn't exactly answer the question of why you suddenly took an  interest in Ranma and Kuno's rivalry, or why Shampoo was here this  morning and again now, does it, Cologne?" Nabiki replied,  glancing at the Amazons out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>"It  no your business what we do, Mercenary Girl," Shampoo snorted,  turning her attention to the gym floor. "Quiet now, is  starting."</p><p>They  watched as the two opponents talked for a moment privately before the  match began, at which point Akane spoke up. "Ranma you dummy...   You don't have the slightest idea what you are getting into, do  you?"</p><p>"Why  do you say that, child?" asked Cologne without looking away from  the proceedings.</p><p>"His  stance, the way he's holding the shinai... It's just obvious that he  doesn't know much about Kendo at all. That stance looks more like  something out of a classical kenjitsu, like Muso Shinden Ryu."</p><p>"He  doesn't?" Ukyo asked. "Why would he accept the challenge  then?"</p><p>With  a sigh, Nabiki answered. "That, Kuonji, is one of Ranma's  little blind spots that I thought he had finally grown out of,  rearing its ugly head once again. Before you showed up, Ranma  actually participated in quite a few martial arts challenges in areas  that he had no knowledge of at all before accepting the challenge,  and a few since then as well. He's been in martial arts contests  based on rhythmic gymnastics, a watermelon relay race, the tea  ceremony, ramen noodle deliveries, French gourmet dining..."</p><p>"Don't  forget the paired ice skating match, or the time he turned Romeo and  Juliet into a four-way brawl," Akane added. "And he didn't  even know how to skate or who Romeo was before he started those  fiascos!" Ukyo boggled as the list continued, and Cologne even  showed a hint of surprise at a few of the listed events.</p><p>"But  he won them all, right?" Ukyo asked while remembering her  earlier meeting with the Golden Pair.</p><p>"Eventually,  yes," Akane answered, hesitantly adding, "but almost every  time he was lousy when he started, and needed a couple of days to  prepare for the rematch."</p><p>"Interesting..."  Cologne commented, squinting slightly as Ranma and Kuno made their  opening strikes.</p><p>"See,  right there!" Akane exclaimed as the shinai broke across Kuno's  head. "That would have been a point if only Ranma had bothered  to call his hit out loud as he attacked. I bet he doesn't even know  that he has to."</p><p>"What  a strange rule. Tell me, what are the official rules for this  contest?" Cologne asked without looking away from the match.</p><p>"Well,  It's fairly simple, really," Akane began. "They have to  hit their opponent with a properly called strike to one of several  targets, including the head, throat guard, chest, and the reinforced  area of the forward-most arm guard. Whoever scores two points within  the time limit wins."</p><p>"And  what of the marked lines?" the elder inquired. "Is there a  reason that Ranma is pushing his opponent towards the line?"</p><p>"Yeah,  they are supposed to stay in that area. If they step outside they  are penalized a point, but if they are pushed out then the penalty is  reversed," Akane explained.</p><p>Cologne  was somewhat surprised at this, and listened carefully as the head  official explained this point again to Ranma. "Penalties? Are  there more such rules?"</p><p>"There  are rules against leg sweeps, grappling, pushing, prolonged  weapon-to-weapon contact, and a bunch of other points of good  sportsmanship," Akane replied.</p><p>Shampoo  complained, "Is stupid art, have too too many rules."</p><p>"Well,  it was originally created as an attempt by sword masters to preserve  some of Japan's rich traditions after it became illegal to carry  swords in public," Nabiki explained absently. "In that  light, it has succeeded admirably." The conversation died away  after this.</p><p>As  the fight wore on and Ranma's attacks grew more desperate, Ukyo felt  progressively more guilt about trying to capitalize on her Ranchan's potential  loss in progress. "Is it just me, or is Ranma looking a bit  slower than usual, too?" she asked.</p><p>"Shampoo  no want to mention, but Airen look tired, like have no stamina,"  the younger amazon replied. "Not used to fight with armor, no?"</p><p>"That  shouldn't be a problem," Akane answered, "the protective  gear is just plastic and cloth, so it doesn't weigh all that much."</p><p>"More  interesting still," Cologne commented gravely. "Perhaps  young Tatewaki is more cunning than I had guessed."</p><p>"Are  you crazy? He's getting beaten all over the ring! Why in the hell  would he be holding back?" Ukyo demanded. Cologne neglected to  answer, leaving Ukyo to silently grumble.</p><p>As  one, the crowd went silence when Ranma dropped his weapon and stood  still, allowing Kuno to score a clean hit. "Airen... give up?"  Shampoo asked hesitantly.</p><p>"No  way..." Akane trailed off.</p><p>"Point,  white!" announced all three referees simultaneously, raising  white flags.</p><p>Rather  than leave, Ranma picked up his discarded weapon and stood in the  ready position, awaiting the referee's command to continue the match.   Kuno took a moment to study his opponent before raising his shinai  to match.</p><p>"What  the hell just happened?" Akane asked, confused.</p><p>"You  said it yourself, Akane. He probably didn't know what he had to do  to actually score a hit," Nabiki began.</p><p>"So  Ranchan let Kuno score a point to find out?" Ukyo asked, not  really expecting an answer.</p><p>"Begin!"</p><p>Immediately  after the command was given Ranma sprang to the attack, forcing Kuno  to back up as the flurry of swings assaulted him. Again and again  Ranma stuck, but Kuno continued to simply back up and defend,  allowing nothing to slip through his guard.</p><p>Ranma  and Kuno's contest ceased as the staccato attacks gave way to a  sudden pause. Ranma stepped back from his opponent and raised his  weapon slowly, watching as Kuno held his guard at a matching height.</p><p>With  a yell Ranma charged, swinging his weapon in a wide horizontal slash  so quickly that from the stands it almost looked like he wasn't  holding anything at all. Kuno moved to counter, but found himself  pressing his weapon not against his opponent's 'blade', but against  the handle. With the shinai held in an underhand grip, Ranma twisted  upwards, striking his solidly beneath his foe's throat guard and  knocking him out of the ring.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Point,  white!"</p><p>He  watched as his foe retrieved his misplaced tool and took the proper  stance opposite him. Noting the eager gleam in his opponent's eye,  the Blue Thunder shifted his stance slightly, tightening his guard in  anticipation of the assault he expected.</p><p>The  battle was rejoined. After several more blows, Kuno noticed that the  attacks were coming with slightly less force. He noted the slight  sheen of perspiration that made itself known under his foe's mask  with interest. Could it be that the demon was lacking in stamina?  With a new strategy, Kuno abandoned the idea of his own offense for  the time being, willing to see if he could weaken his opponent  further with a prolonged waiting game.</p><p>After  many more blows Kuno suddenly found himself left alone, as Ranma  suddenly broke away from the conflict. Tatewaki searched his foe's  steeled eyes as he stood some distance away, breathing deeply and  quickly, until Ranma's eyes narrowed slightly and his foot shifted  forward. Expecting a desperate attack, he planned to strike while  his opponent's guard was wide open.</p><p>Moving  to counter the attack, Tatewaki confidently braced his weapon. Mere  words cannot express the profound surprise he felt when he found  himself inexplicably on his back moments later.</p><p>"Point,  red!" the head referee crowed as Kuno regained his footing.</p><p>"Pray  tell, how is it that I am scored upon? Is not sorcerous trickery  prohibited?" Kuno demanded.</p><p>"I  must admit, it was rather unorthodox form, but regardless Saotome did  manage to strike you in accordance with the rules," Mr. Namura  clarified, looking more at the crowd than at the kendoist. "Take  your position, Mr. Kuno, and continue."</p><p>Kuno  walked to face his waiting opponent, but did not raise his blade.  "You do realize that at the moment of the official's signal we  shall have but mere moments to decide this bout, or it shall be  regretfully labeled a draw? No more holding back, Saotome. Let this  final blow conclude our business!"</p><p>"Do  what you want, Kuno," Ranma replied cockily, "But I'm going  to win anyway."</p><p>Tatewaki  raised his shinai into position, and at the official's call of "Match  point, begin!" he dashed forward, yelling "Strike, strike,  strike..." as he swung rapidly.</p><p>Wide  eyed, Ranma leapt fully over his opponent's head to avoid the attack,  landing heavily behind him. "What the heck is that? I thought  we weren't allowed to use any special techniques!"</p><p>"I  fail to see what is special about attacking quickly," Kuno  replied, turning to his opponent. "Now face me, and let our  blades determine all!" Kuno charged, attacking with blinding  speed as he yelled once again.</p><p>Ranma  met him with the cry "Katsu Tenshin Amaguriken!" his form  blurring as well.</p><p>Almost  as soon as it began, the final confrontation ended. Simply  overwhelmed by the speeds his opponent was capable of, Kuno Tatewaki  found himself disarmed with a blow to his wrist, followed immediately  with a called strike to the throat. Ranma put no force behind the  attack, though, instead freezing at the moment of contact.</p><p>"Point...  Red." the referee admitted ruefully, causing the audience to  roar with applause as the bloody-hued banners rose.</p><p>Ranma  chose this moment to shove the blade under the throat guard, then,  with an upward shove, to knock the Blue thunder to his back yet  again, removing his helmet at the same time. With a contemptuous  gesture he removed his own helmet and tossed both it and his shinai  at the fallen captain's face, shouting, "You honestly thought a  pathetic weakling like you could beat me? Me! I killed a God just  eight days ago! Making me fight you under this retarded sport's  regulations doesn't the change the fact that you will never be my  equal because I have no equals!"</p><p>Mr.  Namura paused, and with a stony expression yelled, "Penalty!  White wins!" Dead silence.</p><p>"Bullshit  he does!" Ranma yelled, turning on the referee. "I scored  two points so I win, you said so yourself!"</p><p>"As  per articles eighteen and nineteen, 'it will be considered a foul  action to insult an opponent or a referee.' Article twenty-two  states that 'the competitor that commits the foul in article nineteen  shall lose the match and leave the court. The opponent will be given  two points. If the player committing the foul has scored up to this  point, the points shall be forfeited completely.'" Seeing  Ranma's disbelieving look, he continued, "You did state that you  were prepared for the match, did you not? That implies full  familiarity with all the rules and regulation of the match."</p><p>"But  I already won!" Ranma demanded. "The match was over before  I said anything!"</p><p>"The  match is not over until I announce the winner, Mr. Saotome, which I  have now done," the referee declared. With a disdainful look,  Mr. Namoura turned his back and walked away from the arena, followed  soon after by the assistant referees.</p><p>Ranma  ignored the comment, raising his weapon. "I want a rematch,  Kuno, right here and right now!"</p><p>Kuno  stood up, offered a short bow to Ranma and them the audience, before  saying simply, "Your request is denied." He walked away,  darkly pondering the odd nature of his victory, ignoring Ranma, who  stood rooted in place, quaking with anger.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>From  his perch in the iron rafters of the gym ceiling he had a perfect  view of all the proceedings. He didn't care who won, really... he  only had to wait until the fight was over, allowing him to surprise  and defeat whomever came out on top. Surely Shampoo would stop  ignoring him when he had managed to defeat the greatest of her two  suitors, right?</p><p>It  was all rather confusing, really. Ranma was clearly winning the  fight, yet the witnesses apparently failed to notice, requiring still  more proof of his dominance. When Ranma finally stopped and took a  hit, Mousse finally understood: this wasn't a fight; it was some  sort of damned sporting event! Leave it to these backwards Japanese  to ruin a good and pure thing like fighting with restrictive rules  and silly concepts like sportsmanship and points.</p><p>Watching  the match as it came to a conclusion, Mousse's anger boiled over.  These two idiots, these perverters of the art, were somehow deemed  worthy of Shampoo, while the love of a loyal and honorable man such  as himself was ignored and scorned? Even the Elder seemed to favor  this new fool, though he could not begin to fathom why. "Is there  no justice in this world?" he muttered.</p><p>With  a scream of rage, he tossed a handful of eggshell bombs at the  retreating victor. As the kendoist jumped back, he dove from nearly  three stories above towards his prey, leading with his hawk's talon  attack. At the last moment, his aim was thrown off as Ranma  jump-kicked the victorious swordsman out of his path. Mousse crashed  into the floor, shattering the smooth wooden planks at impact as his  legs refused to buckle.</p><p>As  the dust settled he saw Ranma tearing off his armor, allowing the  heavy metal plates to clank loudly as they struck the floor. "Damn  it, Mousse, this is my fight! If you have some beef with Kuno it  will have to wait until I'm done with him!"</p><p>"You  had your chance, Saotome!" He yelled back, freeing himself from  the floor and producing a large iron-ribbed cudgel from his robes.</p><p>Kuno  paused for a moment to study Ranma's removed armor, and then tossed  aside his shinai in favor of the bokken that Toji had brought to his  side. "You are both cowards, attacking without warning like  honorless dogs. If it is defeat you crave, then Kuno Tatewaki, the  Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, is more that willing to oblige you!</p><p>At  some unspoken signal all three charged, and the biggest, most  destructive brawl in all of Nerima history had officially begun.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Ranma,  you idiot. All you had to do was shut up, bow, and leave to win.  But no, you just had to prove your point, had to get the last word  in, didn't you?" Akane said wistfully as she watched Mr. Namura  explain the details of the penalty.</p><p>"Killed  a god?" Cologne repeated, then turned to look at the younger  Amazon next to her with a hard glare. "I believe you have some  explaining to do."</p><p>Shampoo  gulped and looked away, then tried to change the subject. "Shampoo  no understand... Who is winning challenge, Great-Grandmother?"</p><p>"Very  well, I will give you time to collect your thoughts on the subject,"  Cologne remarked, not fooled in the slightest. "By Joketsuzoku  standards Ranma clearly was the superior fighter and winner, but  because he technically lost according to the rules he agreed to, I am  not sure. Young Tatewaki's cunning in this matter is commendable,  but to win on a technicality, especially one that occurred after the  fight had already ended, is not our way. I think that I must  conclude this match was a draw, Great-Granddaughter."</p><p>"Um,  what are you talking about?" Ukyo asked. "You make it  sound as if this fight had some significance to you, outside of  simple curiosity."</p><p>"Yes,  you still haven't answered my question Cologne. Just what exactly,"  Nabiki began to ask, but was cut off as explosions rocked the floor,  "...the hell was that!"</p><p>"Looks  like Mousse to me," Akane stated, squinting to see through the  debris and rising smoke.</p><p>"Aiya!   Stupid Mousse no hurt Shampoo's airens!" The purple haired  warrior yelled, leaping over the guardrail to join the fray below.</p><p>"Hey,  is that Kodachi? What the heck is she doing here?" Ukyo  growled, pointing to a smaller form dancing among the growing crowd  of combatants. "I owe that little tramp a beating for what she  said to me this morning!"</p><p>Akane  caught arm as Ukyo rose from her seat and readied her combat spatula.   "She came to try and buy you off, too?" Akane asked, then  continued after  Ukyo's terse nod. "Alright, how about a truce for now?"</p><p>Ukyo  nodded again, answering resolutely, "For now." They both  jumped into the battle, making a line for the leotard-clad girl.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Unbelievable.   Only Ranma could turn a simple one-on-one kendo match into a  free-for-all riot," Nabiki deadpanned, snapping yet another  photo. "Ranma already told me most of what happened, you know.  For a price I could be persuaded to share this information with you,  to compare with whatever Shampoo and Mousse decided to tell you, of  course."</p><p>"No,  that won't be necessary, Miss Tendo," Cologne replied. "I  have my own ways to ensure that those two won't hold any more  information back from me."</p><p>"Suit  yourself," Nabiki muttered, then turned her attention back to  the fight with a shrug, carefully keeping her face neutral as she  fought back her disappointment.</p><p>As  she watched the fight went from two combatants to three, then at  least seven by the time her sister decided to get involved, and after  the entire kendo squad had decided to 'defend the honor of their  captain and school' she had completely lost count. Now it was almost  a living, growing organism, a rolling mass composed solely of  violence and idiocy, absorbing anyone willing to jump in (or simply  standing too close), regardless of martial skill or even rational  motivation.</p><p>"Heh,  look at Kodachi go!" Daisuke laughed.</p><p>"I  don't think I've ever seen Ukyo that mad before!" Hiroshi  replied.</p><p>"Whoa,  Akane really nailed Jiro with that one!" Yuka commented,  flinching at the obviously painful moment.</p><p>"Hey,  is Ranma doing that black thingy again?" Sayuri asked, slightly  fearful.</p><p>Nabiki's  attention was dragged to the far wall as an explosion created a  gaping hole to the outside. Immediately Happosai jumped through the  new opening, weaving his way into the crowd, followed closely by  Ryoga and, um, some big flying thing. She squinted at the creature,  at first noticing its similarity to Pantyhose Taro, but then  dismissing the possibility. He hadn't looked  like that in his cursed form before, had he?</p><p>"Happy  never could stand to be left out," Cologne commented dryly.  "I'm suddenly reminded of the... time..." she trailed off,  turning to study Sayuri with a questioning glance.</p><p>"What?"  Nabiki asked as Cologne trailed off suddenly, shivering slightly as a  mysterious chill ran down her spine.</p><p>Cologne  didn't answer, instead leaping to the guard rail and shouting  desperately, "Shampoo, get out of there now!"</p><p>Before  Nabiki could ask why, an inhuman bellow of rage tore through the din  of the melee, followed by a veritable tidal wave of what she could  only describe as luminous darkness; a wet-looking, shiny void of  solid night that expanded across the entire floor or the gymnasium.  It didn't stop at the edge of the bleachers either, blasting it's way  through the uninvolved spectators on the lower floor despite their  sudden screams of fear, and quickly reaching the balcony as well.  Cologne even turned to run, to Nabiki's ultimate surprise, but to no  avail as the wave crashed across the both of them like a wall of  sub-zero water.</p><p>Almost  as soon as it had come, the chilling energy receded, revealing a  gaping crater where the floor had been. At its center she thought  she saw Ranma floating in midair and howling with his head thrown  back, framed by wispy, shifting black forms that almost looked like  fluttering wings. She looked on him as a horrible, brutal, yet  impossibly beautiful angel of death as the world around her grew dark  and she collapsed into the waiting arms of sweet unconsciousness.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>It  was awake. It opened its eyes and looked on the world around it for  the first time in over a century. It reveled in its returning  memories, a flood of experience several mortal lifetimes long, all in  the exhilarating rush of all its senses activated at once. It was  free, finally free!</p><p>It  examined its arms, gauging the woefully lacking strength they should  hold, the arcane powers its will should be able to direct with but a  gesture and a thought. No, it amended, not free yet. Its mind was  free, but its powers and true form were still sealed away by the  wards.</p><p>Yet,  was this not enough to reclaim the other two? It smiled, a cold,  cruel thing, portraying neither joy nor , with but a little  effort all its former abilities would be returned to it, and then it  could at last return  to it's true realm.</p><p>The  boy would be the key. Already his own awakening had begun, and by  the time it was completed everything would be opened at their feet.  No need for haste though: there was time enough for the process to  complete, time enough to plan and prepare.</p><p>Time  enough for revenge.</p><p><b>Author's  notes:</b></p><p>First  off, let me apologize for scene four. I'm absolutely sure that I've  managed to horribly butcher the Chinese language in my clumsy attempt  to translate  'Kuno-speak' into 'Romanized' Modern Mandarin. Not speaking the language  myself, nor knowing anyone who does, I was forced to make do with a hunt  and peck approach with the aid of an Internet dictionary, (http/easyhosting.   If any bilingual readers wish to  correct my mistakes, please feel free to send me an e-mail. If  you don't speak Chinese, don't feel the need to go out of your way<br/>to  translate the few sentences written in the language. I swear that  there is  nothing there of interest, aside from a few bits of information that  could be  guessed just from the context and the imposed grammar. No secret  hints about  the real plot of the story there at all, nope, none...</p><p>The  wise man quote Kuno offers is actually a slightly paraphrased line from  Rene Descartes. It was actually referring to one of his rather weak proofs  for the existence of God, but if any fictional character has license to  misquote completely out of context a French philosopher who died a  long, long time ago, it has gotta be Kuno.</p><p>Just  in case you're wondering, these actually are the real rules of Kendo,  as per an Internet source whose address escapes me currently. I was web  surfing and curious, and the rule about insults leapt out at me as a  plot device  just begging for use in a Ranma fic.</p><p>If  you were bothered by the sudden tonal changes throughout this act, congratulations!   You got the point! It was my intention in this act, and<br/>this  chapter especially, to illustrate the fact that what may seem like comedy  to an outside observer may in fact be an extremely unpleasant situation  to those involved in it. The involvement of the audience in the "Blacklight  Nova" right after their seemingly innocent enjoyment of the spectacle  acts, in a way, as little bit of vengeance from the characters who's  living nightmares are just so much entertainment fodder for the masses...</p><p>The  title of the act refers to the fact that because of the existence of  friction, the creation of a machine that can utilize true perpetual  motion is  a scientific impossibility. Likewise, the little frictions that  Ranma deals  with in his day-to-day life must eventually lead to the breakdown of the  familiar routines of Nerima. Entropy prevails.</p><p>New  special techniques (in order of appearance):</p><p>Kachu  Tenshin Ashige Imperial Chestnuts Kick</p><p><b>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #2</b></p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered!
