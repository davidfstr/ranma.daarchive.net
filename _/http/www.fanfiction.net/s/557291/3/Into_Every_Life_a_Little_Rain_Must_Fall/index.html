She looked up at the sky idly, following a  small bird with her eyes as it chirped merrily off into the nearly  cloudless cerulean sky. A slight breeze shook her hair softly  against her neck, tickling a bit as it passed. She closed her eyes  as she lifted the first delicious slice of sweet-pickle from the tray  to her mouth, savoring the taste and tangy scent of the morsel. As  she swallowed, she listened absently to the sounds of light  conversation and laughter from her fellow students. All in all, it  was a good contender for the title of perfect day.</p><p>It  had started off as a fairly normal day, as in normal for people who  don't live in Nerima. After yesterday's stunning defeat, Genma  wisely chose to let Ranma 'rest up' this morning without the usual  spar. Akane had ended up staying the night at Sayuri's house, so the  table survived the meal intact and there was no after-breakfast  chase. The food was good, the conversation very light, and  apparently everyone got to school on time, without even the  intervention of a random Amazon attack. Her morning classes were  fairly inconsequential, with the exception of her getting a perfect  score on a calculus quiz.</p><p>This  is why Nabiki was nervous. She could feel something bad coming, like  a knot in the pit of her stomach, and experience had shown that the  longer it takes for the bad thing to happen, the worse it tends to  be. Deep down she just hoped that whatever happened would be at  least a little profitable, and wouldn't involve her.</p><p>"Nice  day, isn't it boss?" asked a rather cheerful Setsuko,  interrupting her thoughts.</p><p>Nabiki  opened her eyes to regard her brown haired assistant, and her  boyfriend, Hasumato Eiji, a rather lanky classmate of Nabiki's with  glasses and short, spiky hair dyed blue at the tips. He wore the  standard Furinkan uniform, but with the added touch of leaving his  jacket undone and the sleeve rolled up to the peaks of his biceps.  Both smiled pleasantly as they sat down across the table, Setsuko  leaning into Eiji's shoulder as he slung an arm around her shoulders  casually, comfortably.</p><p>"Yeah,  I guess," she replied, noticing their matching gold charm  necklaces.</p><p>"What's  with the grumpy face, then? Come on, Nabiki, lighten up a little,"  Eiji suggested. "You gotta take advantage of days like this  when you  get the chance. I've got half a mind to just leave and spend the  afternoon in the park." Setsuko elbowed his side lightly, and  opened her own bento.</p><p>"Yeah,  I guess you're right. It's just, well..." Nabiki looked around  casually before continuing, "It's too nice a day. Maybe I've just  gotten used to the chaos around here, but I just can't help expecting  to see something insane happen any second now."</p><p>"Oh,  don't worry about it. I'm sure Ranma will find something or someone  to break today. Just give it time, boss," added Setsuko.</p><p>"I  wasn't referring to Ranma, actually. It's not like the craziness  around here is all his fault," Nabiki replied between bites  before changing the subject. "How is the 'Kuno-chan come home'  pool coming along?"</p><p>Setsuko  straightened up a bit, to Eiji's disappointment, as she gave her  report. "Well, you said it might take a day or two for Kuno to  figure out that he's chasing himself across Japan, so I broke up  today and the next two school days into half-hour slots. I sold the  time slots at 200 yen a piece, by random draw. I sold almost all of  them already, so regardless of when he comes back we can expect a  5800 yen gross profit."</p><p>"Good,  that will work out nicely," Nabiki replied before taking a  mouthful of rice. "Any new gossip to report?"</p><p>"Nothing  of interest, really. Sato Toji broke up with Seino Hitomi over some  girl from Kolkhoz high. People are still talking about Ranma's  apparent purity, of course. Oh, and Ranma also managed to sleep  through all the morning classes without being sent out to the hall.  Apparently Miss Hinako is a little scared of him after what happened  yesterday," Setsuko finished her report, taking a bite of her  soba noodles and leaning back into Eiji's shoulder. He smiled  slightly as he returned his arm to its former perch, and squeezed her  shoulder warmly.</p><p>"They  just have to flaunt it, don't they?" Nabiki thought with bitter  humor. "It should be illegal to act so obviously in love in the  presence of single people, punishable by a fine at least."</p><p>"Hmm.   So what about... hey, what's Gosunkugi doing over there in that  bush?" The others turned around to see Nabiki's point of  interest.</p><p>Across  the yard and next to the drinking fountains, Hikaru was kneeling  amongst several bushes that backed a wide stone bench. He was  cloaked from head to toe in black, and in place of his usual candles,  he had tied two small leafy branches to his head and another pair to  his back so that they presented a rather cohesive bush disguise. It  would have been, at least, if not for the fact that he could clearly  be seen from behind by anyone who actually bothered to look in his  direction. Akane, walking toward the bench with her friends, was  apparently not so inclined.</p><p>"Well  this looks interesting. Want me to go ask him what the hell he  thinks he's doing, boss, or just watch and see?" asked Setsuko.</p><p>"Nah,  I think I'll handle this one personally. I'm still a little annoyed  that he tried to bargain with me yesterday," Nabiki stood up,  finishing off her lunch.</p><p>"Coming  along, you two?" she asked over her shoulder.</p><p>"Got  nothing better to do," replied Eiji, looking to Setsuko for a  nod.</p><p>As  they approached, Gosunkugi's behavior seemed even more abnormal. He  was shaking slightly, apparently out of a combination of nervousness  and (if the goofy smile on his face was any indication) repressed  maniacal chuckling. In one hand, he held a liquid concoction of some  sort, bubbling and bright red, and in the other, a pair of tweezers.  Akane sat on the bench next to Yuka, chatting absently as Hikaru  slowly reached up from behind her with the tweezers, inch by inch.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"I  know, they were such a good couple! That Toji is such a jerk!"  replied Sayuri as she took her seat.</p><p>"Well,  I just hope Hitomi is ok. I'd be crushed if my boyfriend dumped me  for some American exchange student," added Yuka before quickly  retracting the statement. "Oh, I'm sorry Akane! That was  insensitive of me."</p><p>"We  haven't broken up. Not yet, at least..." replied Akane before  taking on a teasing tone, "Besides, you'd have to have a  boyfriend first, Yuka."</p><p>"Well,  there's always Hiroshi. If shown even the slightest hint of  attention he'd be begging to take me out," Yuka replied  offhandedly.</p><p>"Yeah,  but do you really want to be alone with that pervert? Besides, he's  almost inseparable from Daisuke. If you go out with either of them  it might as well become a threesome," Sayuri paused, smiling  mischievously. "...Then again, it could be a lot of fun."</p><p>"You  little pervert!" responded Akane, laughing. Soon all three were  well into a full out giggling frenzy, the likes of which only a group  of teenaged girls can create. I know she only said that to cheer me  up, but I appreciate it.</p><p>"Hey  Gosunkugi, what's up?"</p><p>The  giggling came to a grinding halt as all three turned quickly around,  finding Hikaru just inches behind them, with Nabiki grinning wildly  just behind him. Gosunkugi jumped at the attention and attempted to  flee. He only succeeded, however, in turning too quickly on his  heels and falling into the dirt, but not before accidentally  splashing the contents of the vial across Nabiki's chest.</p><p>Akane  looked beyond her sister, noticing the presence of others and that  both Eiji and Setsuko had odd, but easily readable, expressions of  lust across  their features, but neither was looking at the other. Gosunkugi took  a quick look around, then leapt to his feet and took of at full  speed, leaving  a trail of falling leaves as he ran around the corner of the school.</p><p>"Hikaru,  you'd better hope this crap doesn't stain or I'll be charging you for  a new uniform." Nabiki muttered as she wiped at her blouse.  "What is  this stuff, anyway? It's all sticky, and smells like roses or...  Oh, this had better not be the stuff you needed the money for!"</p><p>Suddenly,  Akane found herself wondering why her sister was still single.  "She's very smart, a good dancer, loyal to the family, has a good  sense of humor, and is so flirtatious. Why, if only I had Nabiki's  looks I would have landed Ranma for sure by now, other fiancées'  or not. Those long legs, narrow waist, delicately feminine wrists,  smoothly rounded shoulders, sexy hair and neck, deliciously firm and  perky breasts..."</p><p>"To  hell with Hiroshi." whispered Yuka breathlessly.</p><p>"Maybe  a foursome?" offered Sayuri.</p><p>Akane  looked over at her friends, finding them both staring at her sister.  They both had that certain 'dreamy' glaze to their eyes and their  mouths slightly parted as they looked her sister over from head to  toe. She felt a sudden flash of heat and wondered absently just what  was the source of the delightful smell that lingered in the wind.</p><p>"Boss?"  asked Setsuko timidly.</p><p>"Yeah,  what?" replied Nabiki, whose eyes roved franticly around the  shrinking circle of girls as if she thought them ready to pounce.</p><p>"Are  you free tonight? Want to see a movie with me, my treat? You can  pick, I don't care what we watch as long as you're there."</p><p>"Uh,  no thanks, Setsuko... I'm, uh, busy. Reeealllly busy."  Nabiki's breathing was becoming quicker as slowly backed away, still  not taking her eyes off of the assembled predators.</p><p>"Setsuko,  what are you talking about? I thought we were going to have dinner  with my family tonight?" asked Eiji with a sly grin. "I  guess we could skip it, but only if I don't get left out."</p><p>"Oh,  to hell with this..." muttered Yuka, clearing her throat. With  her left hand lightly on her breast above her heart and the other  posed dramatically  skyward, she shouted, "Tendo Nabiki, I would date with thee!"</p><p>Nabiki  broke and ran, shouting, "Hikaru, when I find you you're dead!"   Setsuko, Yuka, and Sayuri immediately dropped everything and began  pursuit in earnest.</p><p>Akane  stood in silence for a moment, watching the chase as it continued  across the yard and rounding the corner. "I don't get it, they  act almost as if Nabiki were Ranma or something... What am I doing?  She's getting away!" Akane's monologue ended abruptly as she  launched herself into the chase, shouting wildly, "Hey, Nabiki,  wait! We're sisters! We're supposed to love each other!"</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Somewhere  on the outskirts of Nerima, in a thickly wooded area atop a gently  rolling hill, Kuno Tatewaki stood, posed dramatically with one foot  on a tree stump. The quest had been long and hard, and he always  found himself just to be a step behind his quarry, never seeming to  gain any ground. Everyone he encountered seemed shocked, rendered  incapable of a clear response, no doubt by the fierce nature of his  hated foe.</p><p>At  dawn, he had wandered into this clearing and taken a moment to rest  as he watched the violet night sky melt away into a glorious orange  morning. It was an omen, he realized, that he had found the  appropriate location for the encounter, where he would surely defeat  the fiendish abuser of the pigtailed girl just as the sun conquered  the night so completely. For hours he had maintained this pose, his  eyes focused on the Eastern horizon, until, at last, he sensed the  approach of another.</p><p>"Knave,  show yourself! Do you fear my wrath even more than the shame of  cowardice?" Kuno demanded, ignoring the tattered condition of  his clothing. "I must return later," he promised himself, "when  time is available for my leisure, and destroy that accursed thorn  bramble. A thousand curses upon that wretched plant!"</p><p>"What's  your problem?" came a response from close behind his personage.   With speed that rivaled even the great Musashi, in full accordance  with the ultimate principle of the fifth ring, no-mind, he turned and  struck a legendary blow with his finely crafted weapon. It was a  bokken of finest iron-oak, richly lacquered, with the engraved and  gold foil pressed emblem of the house of Kuno upon the base of the  grip. Truly, such a perfected weapon designed only for practice  could never have existed anywhere else in the world.</p><p>When  it impacted the skull of Hibiki Ryoga, the finest bokken ever crafted  by man became a shattered stump of twisted wood chips. Rubbing the  point of impact with one hand, Ryoga stated, "You know, if I  were in a worse mood you'd be in some serious trouble right now,  Kuno."</p><p>"Ah,  I apologize for my indiscretion, mighty warrior. I am seeking a vile  miscreant; a falsifier and violator of women, one who has dared to  inflict harm upon one of my lady loves. But fear not, for I shall  find and punish this foe, with the aid of the undaunted heavens, or I  am not Kuno Tatewaki, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, age  nineteen!" Kuno struck his usual triumphant pose, somewhat  lessened in visual impressiveness due to the rather useless lump of  wood in his grasp.</p><p>"Hey,  you're from Furinkan High, right?" the lost boy inquired.</p><p>"Yes,  of course! I am its finest warrior, captain of the kendo and debate  teams, and the most dashing man about campus. Surely the tales of my  prowess and charm have reached even the most remote and barren  corners of out land, where one such as yourself might have had  opportunity to ponder my achievements. Are you then a wondering  student, traveled far in search of my tutelage?"</p><p>Ryoga  cleared his throat, then attempted to steer the conversation  somewhere less pointless. "Yeah, great, whatever. Now, about  Furinkan..."</p><p>"Ah,  the finest secondary educational establishment in all of the blessed  isle, to be sure, even discounting the unfortunate personage of its  principal. It is assuredly so, for nowhere else would a noble spirit  such as myself permit himself to the rigors of public education."</p><p>"Uh,  that's nice. Look do you know where it is?" Ryoga seemed  somewhat annoyed.</p><p>"But  of course! This is but one of the many facts which I have committed  to memory." replied Kuno with head held high.</p><p>"Which  way is it?" asked Ryoga, "I need to find Saotome Ranma, to  prove once and for all that I'm better than he is."</p><p>"Nay,  sir, that shall not come to pass. I, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan  High, shall be the first to bring low that sorcerous blight upon my fair  city. For two years have I strived to best him in daily combat, only  to be deprived of victory again and again by his black rites!"</p><p>"Tell  you what; you get me to him and I'll let you try him first,"  Ryoga offered with a strange grin.</p><p>"Aye,  that arrangement would be acceptable," Kuno replied shrewedly,  keenly aware that defeating the foul one was of greater importance  than the petty detail of who landed the final blow. Not that he  would fail when next they met, of course...</p><p>"So,  which way is the school?"</p><p>"Why,  without a doubt it lies directly to the, um..." Kuno looked  about for a moment, then sat upon the tree stump and puzzled.</p><p>"You're  lost, aren't you?" asked Ryoga tiredly.</p><p>Kuno  leapt to his feet, producing yet another bokken, and pointed back the  way he had come. "Ah ha! It is decidedly that way! Yes, my  peerless mind has solved even this demon-sent riddle with ease. Mwa  ha ha ha ha!"</p><p>"Great,  lead on," Ryoga suggested. "Who is it that you were  looking for again?"</p><p>"He  was described to me as a man of tall body and fluffed, black hair,  wearing the traditional garb of a samurai, blue and black in  coloration. It was also mentioned that he was somewhat... slow of  mind. Do not attempt to</p><p>fight  by yourself, friend, I implore you. Surely someone with skill enough  to fell my beloved pigtailed goddess could only be matched in mortal  combat by me," explained Kuno.</p><p>Ryoga  stared at him for a moment, looking him over thoroughly. "This  pigtailed goddess of yours... is she the one that told you to look  for this guy?"</p><p>"Yes,  undoubtedly it is so! The fiend had the gall to attack a woman, and  so I shall avenge her suffering!" Tatewaki proclaimed. "Why  do you ask?"</p><p>Ryoga  covered his mouth (obviously as a sign of deference, despite the  faint laughter-like sound), before continuing. "Hate to break  it to you, but that was Ranma. He's the reason that you're out here  looking for yourself, pal. Here, take a look."</p><p>Ryoga  fished in his pack for a moment, then produced a mirror. Kuno looked  into the small frame of glass for a moment in silence, comparing the  description of his foe to himself, finding a match in all ways,  except of course the feeble-mindedness. "Ah, I should have  realized it earlier! The crafty demon has enchanted my fair  pigtailed goddess into believing that I myself am the one who  inflicted upon her these grievous wounds! Egad! He has succeeded in  separating me from her side, leaving her utterly vulnerable to  his assault! Quickly, friend, we must make haste!"</p><p>He  dashed off into the woods, paying no attention to the thorns he  charged through as they scratched at his skin. Ryoga, with no better  plan, simply shrugged and followed him, completely untroubled by the  bushes, but taking care to at least avoid the poison oak.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Damn  I can't believe the news about Toji," commented Hiroshi as he  sat down against a tree in the corner of the yard.</p><p>"Yeah,  that lucky dog! He just jumps from one total babe to the next  without batting an eye!" replied Daisuke, digging into his lunch  with fervor.</p><p>Ranma  sat on a branch a few feet above them, relaxing after already  finishing his lunch in typical Saotome fashion. "What are you  guys talking about?" he asked tiredly with one eye open.</p><p>"Oh,  I'll let you know when you're a little older, Ranma," teased  Hiroshi, earning a slight growl.</p><p>"You  don't know? Oh yeah, you were gone. Sato Toji broke up with Seino  Hitomi, and now he is going out with an exchange student named Sara from  another school. She's an American, and you know what they say about  American girls!" answered Daisuke excitedly.</p><p>"Who?"  asked Ranma again, confused.</p><p>"Don't  even bother, Dai," interrupted Hiroshi, "You know Ranma has  absolutely no social life. Heck, he doesn't even recognize the names  of our class president and class representative."</p><p>"I  don't have time to worry about people who aren't out to either kill  or marry me. My schedule is pretty full," answered Ranma,  dejectedly.</p><p>"Oh,  poor Ranma. I'm the toughest man in Tokyo and I'm chased night and  day by beautiful women. Whatever shall I do?" joked Daisuke,  bringing his hands to his face in mock distress. "I know who I  would do... but honestly, man, you can't deny you get all the perks,  despite all the downsides to being you. I mean, Hinako was too  afraid to wake you up all morning!"</p><p>"Yeah,  how did you do that yesterday, anyway? Some new technique you picked  up last week? Heh, it's probably got some goofy name like 'imperial  rotisserie chicken stance' or something, knowing you," inquired  Hiroshi.</p><p>"Nah,  it's gotta be something cooler, like 'vampire hell blaze', right?"  chimed in Daisuke. "Or maybe the infamous 'virginal  frustration' defense."</p><p>Ranma  swung down to face them, hanging from the branch by his knees. "Lay  off, okay! So I'm a, well, you know... so what? If I did follow through  with one of my fiancées I'd be either married, dead, or  dragged off to China before the sun rose the next morning. Possibly  all three."</p><p>Daisuke  flinched, but Hiroshi remained calm and replied, "Alright, we'll  lay of if you tell us about the new technique, won't we, Dai?"</p><p>Daisuke  nodded, quickly finding a blank page in his ever-growing record of  'Ranma-isms', as he called them, supposedly reference material  for some project he was working on.</p><p>"Honestly?   I don't know what the hell I did. It was just an accident, not some  new technique. At least, not yet. Feh, for all I know it could only  work as a counter to her Happo go-en Satsu, and be useless otherwise.   I tried to do it again this morning on the way to class, just  practicing on some stray dogs, but nothing happened. Just wasn't  angry enough, I guess."</p><p>He  shrugged, which looked rather odd upside down.</p><p>"Oh  well. Hey, the important thing is that she thinks you can do it..."  said Hiroshi.</p><p>"Yeah!   As long as she doesn't learn otherwise, she won't be draining  anyone! Excellent!" interrupted Daisuke. He and Hiroshi  exchanged high fives while Ranma only sighed and swung back up to his  branch.</p><p>"Geez,  What's with you, man? We just got a free pass to do whatever we want  in class and you're just moping around," complained Hiroshi.</p><p>"It's  nothing, really. I just got a bad feeling is all. This day has been  way too quiet, so something's bound to happen sooner or later,"  he answered. "And, of course, whatever it is this time is gonna  come screaming to me, as always."</p><p>"Ranma!"  came a distant female scream.</p><p>"Heh.   Well, there's your cue, pal," commented Daisuke, going back to  his lunch. "Female, too. Hey, if you're lucky, maybe you'll  finally get lucky!"</p><p>With  a frustrated sigh, he dismounted the tree, landing on his good foot  and immediately bounded off toward the scream with his crutch under  his arm. Just once, couldn't it be someone else's problem? He  quickly found the source of the disturbance, but was quite surprised  to find Nabiki running toward him, followed by a stampede of pursuers  that rivaled even Happosai's record.</p><p>"What  the heck did you do now?" he asked, bouncing alongside her.</p><p>"Nothing!   Just (huff) get me out of here before (huff) my legs give out!"  she panted, looking back over her shoulder at her pursuers.</p><p>"Alright,  hold on," he commanded, wrapping an arm around her waist. With  a grunt, he leapt towards the top of the school's roof, obviously  going to fall short. Crap, one leg and two people don't make for  good jumping! He quickly lashed out with the crutch toward a window  ledge, just barely catching enough of it with the shoulder grip to  give himself an extra boost.</p><p>With  a flip, they landed on the roof, roughly. "Damn, I'll have to  remember not to try for more than two stories till my ankle's  healed," he admitted while untangling himself from Nabiki. "You  okay?"</p><p>"Yeah,  well, I'm a hell of a lot (huff) better than I was a minute ago,"  she replied, laying flat on her back and closing her eyes.</p><p>He  waited a moment for her to get her breath back, watching as her chest  rose and fell with each gasping breath beneath her sweat and...  something... covered blouse. He looked away abruptly, asking, "So,  what was that all about?"</p><p>"I  caught Gosunkugi about to do something to Akane. I surprised him  just when he was about to strike, and he turned around and flung some  kind of sticky red goo all over me! Next thing I know, everybody  around me is giving me weird looks, one of my assistants asks me out  on a date, and then Akane's friends wig-out Kuno style!" she  explained.</p><p>"Wig-out  Kuno style? That can't be good. Well, at least it smells nice,"  he reasoned.</p><p>"Like  that's any consolation! Being hounded by a school full of potential  rapists isn't my idea of a good time, Ranma!" she yelled.</p><p>"Welcome  to my life," he replied. "Look, just calm down, okay  Nabiki? I've got experience with this sort of thing, and it really  isn't all that bad. Usually these love potion things only last a day  or so, and in any case I'm sure Cologne can take care of it for you.  I mean, if the Gos-man could make the spell work, it can't be that  hard to remove, can it?"</p><p>"Well,  I guess so. I'm just not used to being caught up in the local chaos,  you know? I'm more of sidelines kind of girl," she added,  keeping a close eye on him.</p><p>"Come  on, we've got her cornered! You all saw how Ranma almost missed that  jump, so no way he can just jump them both down!" The yell from  the stairwell sounded oddly a lot like Akane.</p><p>"Hell,  they're right," Ranma admitted, looking around for a place to  hide or get down. "Nabiki, I need you to be very still and  quiet. Try to keep your mind blank, so your chi doesn't interfere  with mine."</p><p>"What?"  she asked as he scooped her up into his arms.</p><p>"Quiet,  still, no thoughts. Now," he repeated evenly as he closed his  eyes and concentrated, gathering and readjusting his chi around him  to activate the Umisenken technique. Nabiki tensed slightly, but  forced herself to follow his instructions as the door opened. They  waited silently behind the open door, remaining motionless as the  hoard of students led by Akane streamed onto the roof.</p><p>For  several tense moments, they searched the roof, looking down the sides  and glancing off around the school grounds. Eventually, Akane yelled  in frustration "Well, she must have snuck by us! Come on, we'll  split up and search the whole town if we have to! Besides, I can  still smell her, so she can't have gotten far!" Ranma quickly  jumped up to the smaller roof section above the door as the students  charged back down the stairs, none even glancing in their direction  as they passed.</p><p>Nabiki  sat absolutely still in his arms as the sound of footsteps drifted  off into the distance. He held her tightly, enjoying the subtle  fragrance of her hair, her skin... just like roses. "Why couldn't  I have been engaged to her instead?" he wondered. "She's so much  smarter, sexier, and less violent than Akane is. I could stay like  this forever, just holding her in my arms and enjoying the silence."</p><p>This  relative peace only lasted a few moments, though, until she spoke up.   "Uh, I think it's clear, Ranma."</p><p>"Yeah,  I guess," he sighed before hopping back to the lower roof  surface and returning her to her own feet. He did not, however,  completely release her from his grasp.</p><p>"Maybe  Hiroshi and Daisuke are right." He pondered for a moment. "Maybe  I really am missing out..." He shifted his right hand to trace the  curve of her left breast, cupping it gently as he bent his head down  to lightly kiss along her neck and left earlobe.</p><p>She  jerked immediately in his grasp, but did not manage to break his  hold. Somewhat unevenly, she suggested, "Uh, you can let go of  me now, Ranma."</p><p>"Aww,  now why would you want me to do that, Nabiki-chan? We've got the  entire roof to ourselves and it's such a nice day to be outside,"  he answered, not loosening his grasp on her waist, nor halting his  gentle fondling. "Besides, I just saved you, so you owe me  something as a reward... and I like holding you like this."</p><p>"Ranma,  let me go. Now," she commanded. He stopped his movement, but  did not release her. He stared intently into her eyes, noting the  nervous movements  of fear with some confusion. Her mask of ice was crumbling, allowing  her fear to show through. "Please, Ranma... please don't."</p><p>Reluctantly,  he let go of her and stepped away. His urge to take her right this  minute warred for a moment, but ultimately lost against his will to  protect her rather than cause more harm. "I, I'm sorry, Nabiki.   I would never...I mean, I'd never hurt you, I..."</p><p>She  came no closer to him, but replied, "Ranma, it's okay, it's just  the potion talking. You have to fight it... and I had better get rid  of this as soon as possible." She waited for a moment as he  stood with closed eyes, breathing deeply and smoothly. "Are you  going to be okay now?"</p><p>"Yeah...   I think I'm alright," he answered uncertainly. "Let's  get going, and I mean like now." Before I lose it again...</p><p>"Us?   Ranma, I don't think that such a good idea, you know?" she  said, still maintaining a distance.</p><p>"Nabiki,  I swear I won't do that again if I can help it... but if you go by  yourself then what will you do if the others find you? They may not  be able or willing to resist it as much as I am right now..."  ...And I won't be able to keep this up for long. Just looking at her  makes my mouth water.</p><p>Hesitantly  she walked toward him, but did not come within a yard. "Okay,  you have a point, Ranma. If you try anything though, I swear on my life  that your entire family won't have a yen to its name for generations  to come... is that clear?"</p><p>"Yes,  Nabiki, completely... but on two conditions. Neither of us mentions  this to anyone..." he swallowed and looked away, "and I get  just one kiss before this wears off. Deal?"</p><p>She  stood silent for what seemed like an eternity, staring right at him  as her expression shifted slightly from shock to a thin smile.  "Yeah, okay, but not until we get to the Cat Cafe, alright?"   Nabiki waited for his nod, then walked past him toward the stairway.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>After  stifling a sneeze, Mousse leaned against the wall idly with his eyes  closed, enjoying the brief rest after the lunch rush had finally  passed. Not that he was physically tired, of course, but he was  weary of dealing with these damned Japanese customers, and this cold  wasn't helping at all.</p><p>They  were always so polite and reserved to his face, to the point of being  patronizing. As soon as he walked away from their tables they almost  always began with the usual 'Chinese immigrants are taking over this  country, little by little. Good food, though...' type comments, or  worse. Somehow, they simply assumed that he was incapable of truly  understanding their language because his eyes didn't slant the right  way, or that he wouldn't be able to hear every word they said, no  matter where he was in the restaurant. His bad vision had always  plagued him, but there were times when he cursed his acute sense of  hearing even more.</p><p>His  bitter reverie was cut short by a sharp strike to the top of his  head. "Wake up, Mr. Part Time! Just because there are no  customers for the moment does not mean that you have earned a break.  Go and sweep the floors, wipe down all the stools and tables, and  then get busy on dishes. When I have completed Shampoo's training  session for the day, then you may rest until the dinner crowd comes.  Not one second sooner."</p><p>"Dried  up old hag..." he muttered as he began sweeping, earning another  blow by way of a thrown serving spoon.</p><p>"I  hear you, idiot. Less talk, more sweep!" Cologne yelled from  the back lot, through the open kitchen door.</p><p>"Damn  her!" He scowled, but wisely kept it internal this time. "Damn  this whole God forsaken island and every intolerant, bigoted soul on  it. Nothing would be better than for their sacred Mt. Fuji to erupt  in their faces and wipe them all from the earth in fire and ash. No,  the only thing that would be better is for it to explode with Shampoo  and I safely at home, and with Saotome Ranma and the crusty old bitch  training in the crater as it blows."</p><p>With  a sigh, he quickly revised that thought. "No, that wouldn't do.  That lucky fool Saotome would probably find some way to not only  survive, but also discover some new technique out of being at the  center of the explosion. As if he weren't powerful enough as it is.  Truth be told, I doubt I'll ever reach Ranma's level now, not after  seeing what he's truly capable of doing when provoked. I should tell  Cologne what really happened at Jusendo, and then maybe she'd realize  that she will never convince Ranma to join us, that he is impossible  to force into anything."</p><p>"No.   Shampoo won't tell because it would guarantee that she lose her  claim to Ranma. I can't tell because it would destroy my chances  with Shampoo if I hurt her like that. Damn him! How can he so  callously reject her love, the only thing I've ever wanted in my  whole life, and then tempt me with the prospect of enslaving her will  with those damned eggs?"</p><p>His  thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the high-pitched jingle  from the little bells hung on the door, quickly followed by an  equally high-pitched voice. "Hey, Mousse! Can you go and get  Cologne for me? I need her advice on something, I think. Oh, and I  need some hot water, too! Nabiki said she'd kiss me, but only if I'm  male at the time. Stupid Mrs. Tanaka and her ladle..."</p><p>Mousse  slowly put his glasses on and looked at the person before him. It  looked like Ranma, it talked like Ranma, but there was something  decidedly wrong with his rival today. He was in his girl form, still  wet and dripping water on the area he just finished cleaning, and was  acting rather distracted. Every couple of words he looked back over  his shoulder at the door, and his skin was almost as red as his hair  currently was. Strangest of all, he was leaning on a crutch.</p><p>"Why  should I do you any favors, Saotome?" he asked skeptically, and  then sneezed again.</p><p>"Because  it's your place to serve your betters, idiot. Go get the water he  asked for, and then start on the dishes. Keep Shampoo out back as  Son-in-law said, for now," answered Cologne from behind him,  with yet another crack to the skull. He grudgingly left the room,  rubbing his aching head as he went, but remained within earshot.  "...And take something for that nose! What would we do if a  health inspector came in with you sneezing all over the place?"</p><p>"Nabiki,  my love, you can come in now!"</p><p>"I  thought I told you to stop saying that. Why are you still a girl?"</p><p>He  came back into the dining area with a cup of boiling broth from a  soup pot, noticing the odd situation. Nabiki stood in the corner,  keeping her eyes on Ranma, but keeping the redhead between herself  and Mousse. Cologne sat nearby, watching the scene and chuckling  slightly. He snapped Ranma out of his odd behavior with a quick  splash.</p><p>"Hot!   Hot! Hot!" Ranma danced around frantically for a moment,  dripping with broth and noodles. Nabiki stared at Mousse as her  shield left his post, backing away slightly.</p><p>"Is  there some reason you have to fear... ahhhh," Mousse paused to  breathe awkwardly for a moment, keeping his hand posed to pinch off  his nose for a moment before continuing his question. "...Me  today, Ten...achoo!" He pinched it off just in time, causing  his entire face to momentarily puff as the pressure escaped. His  shoulders sagged as he released a long deep breath with  his eyes still closed.</p><p>"Very  clever, Mr. Part Time. Now how, pray tell, were you planning on  escaping punishment for your little trick?" Cologne asked from  atop her cane,  smiling without amusement. "What, no escape plan? I thought as  much. You just lost that break, and every other break this week.  Satisfied? Good. Now get back to the kitchen and don't make any  more trouble, or I'll lock you in  the cage."</p><p>Grumbling,  he returned to the kitchen and resumed eavesdropping while searching  his robes for an antihistamine.</p><p>"So,  can I get that kiss now?"</p><p>"Forgive  me for interrupting, my dears, but what exactly brings a lovely young  flower like yourself to me this afternoon?"</p><p>"Oh  crap, not you too! Aren't you too old for that sort of thing?"</p><p>"Oh,  I suppose so, Son-in-law. Nothing can stop me from enjoying the view  though, right?"</p><p>"Oh  man, that's scary..."</p><p>"Say,  Cologne, you wouldn't be willing to do me a favor, would you? I'd  really appreciate it."</p><p>"But  of course, Nabiki, I'd do anything for you!"</p><p>"Do  you know of any love potions that use something called dragon rose as  an ingredient?"</p><p>"But  of course I do! Not a very reliable thing, really, although very  potent. It only works as long as the smell remains in the target's  nose."</p><p>"Hey,  what about my kiss?"</p><p>"Great,  so you know how to cure it, right?"</p><p>"But  of course! The ingredients are very expensive, but I could never  refuse you anything, young beauty!"</p><p>"Hey!   We had a deal, Nabiki!"</p><p>"Geez...   Can't you wait for just a minute Ranma? She hasn't even made  the cure yet!"</p><p>"Aiya,  Airen here for to visit Shampoo!"</p><p>Mousse  jumped for a moment at the shriek behind him, quickly turning to face  her. "No, Shampoo! The old mummy said that you have to stay  back here!" he begged as he stood in the doorway waving his  hands franticly.</p><p>"Stupid  Mousse, you no stop Shampoo from visit Airen!" She casually  kicked him through the door and entered after him.  "Great-grandmother, what you... Aiya! Nabiki too, too cute!  Come to ask Elder if become Amazon and share airen with Shampoo,  yes?"</p><p>Nabiki  jumped behind Ranma, answering "Uh, Nabiki come to join  Amazons... no."</p><p>"Aha,  so that is why you were interested in a cure! Yes, of course, an  untargeted love potion! I have just thing for you in the back, my  sweet child," answered Cologne, who quickly bounced off into the  storage room on her staff.</p><p>"Just  what in the hell is going on around... achoo!" Mousse asked,  quickly covering his nose with a handkerchief produced from his  sleeve.</p><p>Nabiki  momentarily paused behind Ranma in her game of 'keep away from  Shampoo' to regard him as he wiped at his nose. "Wait... you  can't smell anything  right now, can you Mousse?"</p><p>"Unfortunately,  no, I can't," he grumbled. "Why?"</p><p>"Good,  that means at least one person inhere won't be affected by this  damned potion!" She replied while running towards him. As soon  as she moved,  Shampoo sprang at her, only to be tripped up by Ranma.</p><p>"Airen  no should stop Shampoo!" she complained, but Ranma held her in a  bear hug to the floor, with her arms pinned firmly to her sides.</p><p>"Saotome,  you bastard! Get your hands off of Sham...Achoo!" cried Mousse  with indignity as he threw a variety of chains towards his rival. The  sneeze, however, was enough to throw off his aim and send his glasses  flying.</p><p>Nearly  an hour later, Cologne returned to the dining room with a clothespin  on her nose. In her hand was a small cup of bubbling, purplish liquid,  wreathed in dark gray vapors.</p><p>Ranma,  Shampoo, and Nabiki looked in her direction, all three bound securely  to an overturned table with multiple lengths of chain. Mousse did  not look up, choosing instead to continue looking for his lost  glasses, which he  promptly stepped on.</p><p>She  paused, surveying the scene before her with a slight chuckle as he  cursed. "Quite the day for you, eh Mousse? Defeating Ranma,  Shampoo, and for some reason Nabiki while I was gone."</p><p>"I  did what?" he asked, finally giving up on that pair of glasses  and producing a second from his sleeve. He turned to regard the  three rather annoyed  captives, two of whom simultaneously growled at him. Nabiki,  however, wasted no time whatsoever in downing the cure offered to  her.</p><p>"Well,  I would have been impressed if you had done it on purpose..."  replied Cologne while she removed the chains. Ranma and Shampoo  paused for a moment and looked at Nabiki, who returned a curious  look. Ranma blinked and grinned, but was cut off from replying when  Shampoo turned back to look at him and immediately tackled him to the  floor with a wild smile.</p><p>"Gah!"  yelled Ranma, as he tumbled backward with an armload of Amazon.</p><p>"Airen!"  cried the armload, rubbing as much of her against as much of him as  she could presently manage.</p><p>"Achoo!"  sneezed Mousse. "I mean, Shampoo!" he yelled as he  prepared to attack yet again.</p><p>"Honestly,"  Nabiki commented offhand as the chaos resumed once more.</p><p>"Enough  of this nonsense, all of you!" commanded Cologne, punctuated  with a sharp crack to Mousse's skull. "Shampoo, get up.  Son-in-law, Tendo, get out of here so we can clean this mess up. Oh,  that will be 25,000 yen for the cure, by the way."</p><p>"I  thought you said it was a favor," replied Nabiki, crossing her  arms.</p><p>"I  do believe that I was not in my right mind at the time I offered such  a bargain, Miss Tendo," Cologne replied coldly, "but you  were still very much in command of your faculties when you accepted  the counteragent I prepared."</p><p>Nabiki  did not back down. "You failed to explicitly state the change  in price before I consumed it."</p><p>"Would  you rather I had left you with the effect?" Cologne asked  smugly. "I could always reapply it for you."</p><p>Nabiki  took a quick, nervous glance at Shampoo and Ranma. "No, that  won't be necessary. I could give you 10,000 yen, just to be fair."</p><p>"20,000,"  answered Cologne, "in light of the apparent confusion."</p><p>Nabiki  smirked. "15,000 yen, and I don't tell the health department  about Mr. Sniffles over there. They can be quite... thorough in  their investigations,  especially when potentially illegal immigrants are involved."</p><p>"Why  you greedy... achoo!" interrupted Mousse, who was himself  interrupted by a sneeze. He looked away from Cologne's gaze  sheepishly, wiping  his nose.</p><p>"Very  well, 15,000 it is," conceded the elder. "I'll expect  payment soon, girl."</p><p>"Oh,  that won't be a problem... I'll just subtract it from your bill,"  Nabiki replied as she handed over a strip of paper. "The repair  bills that Shampoo and Mousse earned the other day at the wedding.  100,000 yen, each."</p><p>"Shampoo  only attempt kill obstacle," whispered Shampoo, turning away  from Nabiki disdainfully.</p><p>"My,  that's quite a high figure. What exactly did you two do the other  day?" asked Cologne, eyeing Mousse with a cold glare.</p><p>"Oh,  they only managed to destroy my family dojo, and our ancestral shrine  that was located inside it," Nabiki offered with a dismissive  hand gesture.   "The bill has been divided up evenly among everyone who crashed  the event, just in case you were wondering."</p><p>"Don't  look at me, I was just there for the cure! Shampoo was the one  who..." Shampoo shot him a cold glare now as well, and he  immediately slumped.   "Oh fine, it was all my fault. Shampoo was a perfect little  angel and did nothing whatsoever at the wedding that would cause  damage, like destroying another wall and throwing bombs all over the  crowded room." Shampoo's look didn't soften much.</p><p>"Hmm.   Well I suppose I'll just have to take out a loan, and pay off the  interest by withholding your salary." Cologne now looked away  from Mousse to Shampoo, who did not return her look or even make eye  contact. "And your allowance, great-granddaughter."</p><p>"But  Shampoo innocent!"</p><p>"Child,  need I remind you that I was not born yesterday? Go back to your  practice." Cologne answered sharply. Shampoo lowered her head  and left the room quietly. "I will have your 185,000 yen by  next Monday, Miss Tendo, But I strongly suggest you don't come to me  for favors anytime in the near future. Now kindly take your leave."</p><p>"Pleasure  doing business with you," said Nabiki with a smile as she left,  followed closely by Ranma after he muttered a quick thanks.</p><p>Cologne  grumbled to herself after they had gone, crumpling the bill in her  hand and tossing it over her shoulder at Mousse's face. "Did  Son-in-law seem somewhat... wrong to you, Mousse?" she inquired,  still looking in the direction of the door.</p><p>"Other  than the crutch and the effects of the potion? No more than usual,"  he replied, catching the wad of paper after it struck his face and  dropping it in the trash.</p><p>"For  a second there I thought I felt... oh, never mind. I'm probably  just finally starting to get old," she mused."Now then,  Mousse, I think it is high time for you to get started on cleaning  this place. You can start with the soup noodles on the floor,"  she suggested as she hopped away.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"One  Shrimp Deluxe!" declared Ukyo cheerfully as she served it the  last customer in line. Wiping a few beads of sweat from her brow,  she decided to take a short break. "What is going on today?" she  wondered. "It's never been this busy until at least five on a  weekday! Oh well, money is money and I'm not complaining, especially  with that debt hanging over my head."</p><p>She  went into the storage room and up the stairs to the small loft  apartment she called home, first grabbing a green apple from a bowl  in her kitchenette, and then immediately collapsed on her couch.  With a pleased sigh, she pulled her feet up and lay completely out on  the couch, enjoying the rest as she took a bite of the slightly sour  fruit. "Hmm, just like my Ranchan. A little under ripened and  sour at first, but oh so sweet and refreshing once you get used to  his special sort of flavor. Wait... Ranma! Ranchan was coming over  today, and he'll be here any minute! I have to take a shower, wash  my hair, change clothes..."</p><p>"Ukyo-sama,  Saotome Ranma is here to see you. Shall I send him up?" called  Konatsu from the stairwell.</p><p>She  grit her teeth in annoyance. "Uh, keep him busy for a few  minutes, okay? Give him a free okonomiyaki and ask him to wait a sec  while I freshen up," she called down, and then immediately went  into a frenzy of activity.</p><p>In  the span of four minutes she managed to shower, wash her hair, shave  her legs, brush her teeth, dress in her Ranchan's favorite royal blue  robe, tie her hair up in a perfect white bow, and practice her 'cute'  smile twice in the mirror. The fact that she cut herself twice and  still had soap in her eye was promptly ignored.</p><p>"Konatsu?"  she called down the stairs, wiping at her eye.</p><p>After  a moment he answered, "Yes, Miss Ukyo?"</p><p>"Send  him up, please. I'm ready!"</p><p>As  she heard the sound of footsteps approaching, she quickly went  through four poses, finally deciding to set on the couch with one leg  up, facing the door, with one arm resting on the back of the couch  and the other in her lap, head back and eyes closed.</p><p>"Uh,  you comfortable, Ukyo?" asked Ranma as he entered.</p><p>Immediately  she opened her eyes (but not too quickly) and gave him the second  'cute' smile (small and sweet, with only a little bit of teeth) as  she rose to greet him. "Hey Ranchan! Nice to see you!"</p><p>"Yeah...  um, nice bow," he replied.</p><p>Yes!   "You like it, Ranchan? It's new! I just got it yesterday, so  you're the first person to see me wear it!" she answered  cheerfully.</p><p>He  stood in silence for a moment, scratching the back of his head in his  I've-got-something-to-say-but-don't-know-how-to-say-it manner before continuing.   "You remember why I'm here, right?"</p><p>Mentally  she cursed, hoping he had forgotten about that. With much less cheer  she replied, "Yeah, Ranchan, I remember." She decided that  if overwhelming cuteness wasn't going to work then time for plan B;  irresistible waterworks. With a little tearing up (now thankful for  the still present soap in her eye), she pleaded, "Ranchan, I'm  so sorry about what I did the other day. I just, I just wanted..."</p><p>Ranma  offered a friendly pat on the shoulder, which she immediately turned  into a rather awkward hug. He put forth his best defense, "Ukyo...   Come on, don't cry. I understand what you were trying to do, and I  appreciate the fact that you wanted to protect me."</p><p>"So  you forgive me? You're not angry anymore?" she asked, her  large, watery eyes looking up from his chest with hope.</p><p>He  let go of her, stepping back and turning sideways. "I don't  know yet, Ukyo. Just like I said the other day, it's not the bombs  that I'm mad about, it's the attitude. I'm mad because you, all the  other girls, and even my family decided that I can't control my own  life."</p><p>"But,  but you were there, Ranma, in a tux and everything! How was I  supposed to act when I saw my fiancé about to wed another  girl?" demanded Ukyo,  stepping into his view. "I was devastated when I heard the news  from Nabiki! I cried for hours and had to close the restaurant  because I just couldn't take it! Then Shampoo called, and we decided  to team up just this once to stop it from happening."</p><p>His  reaction was not at all what she expected. "I am so sick of  everyone dragging me around, yelling at me to marry practically every  girl alive, attacking me for no reason, and then blaming everything  that they just did on me! I'm only human, damn it!" He stood  back and glared at her with burning eyes.</p><p>"Do  you know what I had to deal with just this afternoon? Do you?"  he demanded. He continued before she could open her mouth. "Since  lunch I've been taunted about my virginity, affected by a love  potion, forced to sneak around  a posse of students, drenched by a senile old hag, scalded with soup,  tackled by an Amazon, and chained to a table! Don't you think I  deserve a break once in a while?" Ranma through his arms above  his head and his head back in frustration. "And today was actually  one of my -good- days!"</p><p>He  held his head with both hands and stood in silence, just breathing  deeply with his eyes closed. "Ranchan... You're scaring me,"  she admitted after a very tense silence. He lowered his head and  rubbed his forehead before bringing his gaze to hers. "I'm  sorry, Ranma, really. I wasn't thinking straight, you know? Please  calm down..."</p><p>Ranma  lowered his head again, looking at the floor with a sigh. "Yeah,  I think I know what you mean. Just like I'm not quite right at the  moment, either." He took her hand and sat down on the couch  next to her before continuing. "Ukyo, the only reason I was  there at the wedding at all was because Pop and Mr. Tendo knocked me  out and dressed me in the stupid tux. Then they all tried to  blackmail me with a cure that should have already rightfully been  mine. It wasn't my idea at all."</p><p>"Well  how was I supposed to know that?" she asked softly, her voice  strengthening as she continued. "Ranchan, look at it from my  point of view. You run off to god knows where for a week with  Shampoo and Akane, and don't even tell me where you're going. Then  Nabiki comes in here, and before she even mentions that you're  still alive she starts talking about a wedding for you  two!"</p><p>"You  could have trusted me, Ukyo, maybe just a little," he replied  softly. Ukyo stiffened. "You're my oldest friend... and my  fiancée. There's no way I would run off without at least  talking to you about it first."</p><p>"Then  why didn't you tell me you were running off to China last week?"  she asked.</p><p>"That  was sort of a Jusenkyo-cursed-only kind of deal, Ukyo... and time was  critical. That may not be the best excuse, and I'm sorry, but it's  also a completely different situation; I had every intention of  coming back. Believe me, Ucchan, if I had plans to run off with one  of you girls I'd at least tell everyone first," he said, almost  more to himself than to her. "I'm not my father, after all."</p><p>"So  it's true? What Nabiki said? That you haven't made a decision yet?"  she asked in a pleading tone.</p><p>"Yeah,"  he sighed.</p><p>"So,  am I forgiven, Ranchan?" she begged, noting his use of her  nickname.</p><p>"Yeah,  I guess," he conceded, with a smile. "Just promise me you  won't go off the deep end again the next time something crazy  happens, okay, Ucchan?   I've got enough problems with out you going nuts on me, too."</p><p>"So,  you had a rough day, huh?" she offered, "Me too, but not  that rough. Just a bunch more customers than I expected."</p><p>"Well,  that's probably related to mine. Nabiki and I had some trouble that  we went to Cologne to fix. We sent all their customers to you while  things were crazy," he replied.</p><p>"So  you recommended my restaurant to all those people? Thanks, Ranchan!"   she said while giving him a quick hug.</p><p>"Uh,  actually, that was mostly Mousse's idea, but it sounded good so I  went along with it," he answered. She was prepared to reply,  but was interrupted by a yell from Konatsu.</p><p>"Miss  Ukyo! Come quick, I need your help! Tsubassa is here again, and two  other people are causing trouble as well, shouting something about  Mister Ranma!" he called up the stairs.</p><p>"Hell,  just when this was getting good again..." Ukyo mentally replied in  frustration.</p><p>They  both hurried down the steps and found the dining area a complete  circus. Customers were diving for cover as Konatsu dueled in mid air  over their heads with a phone booth that kept yelling "Charge!"</p><p>Off  to the side of the counter, however, stood two people who had not  panicked. The first was a tall and rather handsome boy with short  brown hair, who wore a rather expensive looking blue suit and jacket  with a golden necktie. At his side was a rather petite girl with  slightly reddish-brown hair, wearing a matching golden spaghetti  strapped dress and a blue bow above her ear.</p><p>The  boy watched the fight with a superior smirk as the girl clutched to  one of Ukyo's plates and kept muttering something that sounded  French. He turned to snatch the plate from her grasp roughly, but  something wasn't right about the way he moved... "Ah," she  realized, "both were wearing roller blades for some reason."</p><p>Behind  her, Ranma started banging his head on the doorframe, muttering,  "Crap, not them again. All I need now is to be jumped by Ryoga  and this day will be officially my crappiest ever."</p><p>"You  know them, Ranchan?" she asked as she tossed a handful of  spatulas at the phone booth when she had a clear shot, earning a yelp  from the person inside.</p><p>"Unfortunately,  yeah," Ranma admitted, pointing towards them. "Sanzenin  Mikado and Shiratori Azusa, the 'Golden Pair' of martial arts  ice-skating. I beat them in a fight before you came to town, with  Akane as my partner. Well, as my first partner, anyway. I got  changed and then Ryoga showed up... well, you get the general idea.  Just keep on guard around Mikado, okay? He tends to be rather...  forward with women."</p><p>"Forward?   How?" she asked as she batted the booth with her Big Ass  Spatula, finally forcing Tsubassa out of his disguise as it shattered  against the wall.</p><p>"I  really don't want to talk about it," he answered evasively.</p><p>Ukyo  glanced at him with one eyebrow raised quizzically, then returned to  dealing with the most active intruder. "Alright, Tsubasa, I've  warned you often enough to stay the hell out of here. I guess I'll  just have to beat it into you this time."</p><p>Ukyo  swung the spatula at the cowering, overly cute boy in drag on the  floor, but she missed as he was quickly dragged out of it's path.  "No! You can't hurt my precious Rupaul! He's so cute, and  you'll ruin him if you do!" She raced out of the restaurant  tightly holding onto a very panicky (and recently renamed) Rupaul,  who screamed in girlish terror, albeit cutely.</p><p>Mikado  held his brow with one hand, muttering "He? You imbecile..."  as Ranma chuckled from the doorway. "Aha! There you are,  Saotome, hiding behind another man like a coward! We've... I've  come to challenge you to a rematch, to avenge the only mark against  my record and regain the following of my former fan club! I've  trained so hard for this day that I haven't even been able to find  the time to kiss any girls in the last year and a half!"</p><p>"Man!"  cried Ukyo indignantly, "I'm a woman, you idiot!"</p><p>"Coward!"  shouted Ranma. "You moron, you couldn't beat me then and you  don't have the slightest prayer against me now!"</p><p>Mikado  ignored them both, his eyes trained on Konatsu as he began to  rearrange the disturbed furniture. "Well, no time like the  present..." He rolled over to Konatsu suddenly, lifting the  surprised ninja off his feet and into his arms, "To think that  such a lovely flower of womanhood could fight so bravely, and yet  have no man to aid her or applaud her victory. Please, accept from  me my sincerest appreciation of your talents and beauty, my  long-awaited 3000th kiss!" Without further warning, he leaned  in on the flabbergasted Konatsu and seized the ninja's lips.</p><p>Ukyo's  eyes bugged as she witnessed this scene, and grew even wider when she  noticed Konatsu's arms wrap around Mikado's shoulders and return the  kiss with abandon. Mikado stood amazed, receiving his first positive  response to one of his advances. After a moment, the kiss ended and  Mikado returned Konatsu to the ground with an absent expression and a  goofy smile.</p><p>Ranma  backed away slowly, looking a bit green, until the kiss ended.  Glancing at the few remaining patrons, he suggested "Uh, come on  back to the storage room so we can talk about this, privately.  There's something you really ought to know, Mikado."</p><p>When  Ukyo, Konatsu, and Mikado had all followed him back, he closed the  door. "I never thought I'd say this, but I thank you may have  finally found your niche, Sanzenin. That's two in a row for you,  isn't it?"</p><p>"What  do you mean by 'two in a row', Saotome? I don't understand..."  asked a still slightly out of it Mikado.</p><p>"That's  the second guy in a row you've kissed, and from the look on your face  I think you liked it!" proclaimed Ranma. "Here, recognize  me?" he asked with a chuckle as he poured a glass of water from  a nearby table over his head.</p><p>"Number  2491! But, Saotome, where...?" Mikado leaned on a crate of  soba noodles for support as he witnessed the change.</p><p>"Ranchan?   You kissed him?" she asked, shocked. Konatsu looked very  curiously at him.</p><p>"Other  way around, Ucchan," Ranma said defensively. "I don't  think he knew exactly what he was doing, either."</p><p>Ukyo  nodded in understanding, and handed him a kettle of hot water, as  Ranma continued his explanation. "Ancient Chinese curse of  Jusenkyo, pal: Spring of Drowned Girl. Cold water curses me,"  she explained as she dumped the water over her head, "but hot  water returns me to my normal form." With a dark snicker he  added, "Just in case it wasn't clear, I'm a guy."</p><p>"And  you suffer from such a curse as well?" asked Mikado pleadingly  as he took Konatsu's hand.</p><p>"Um,  no, I don't. I was born a guy but I was raised as a girl. I still  consider myself one, at heart" answered the ninja.</p><p>The  room was silent for a moment as Ukyo looked on with pity, Mikado  seemed to simply freeze, and Ranma looked on with disgust as he  wondered out loud, "You mean he's gay? I always thought he was  just confused..."</p><p>"News  to me, too, Ranma," admitted Ukyo, although without the  accusatory tone.</p><p>"It  never really came up..." Konatsu offered, helpfully, "And it's  not like it has any effect on either of you."</p><p>"But  I, but..." Mikado sprang to his feet and skated away, with  bitter tears streaming down his face as he fled. "This cannot  be!" he proclaimed as he rushed out the door.</p><p>"Too  bad, he was pretty cute, wasn't he, Miss Ukyo?" asked Konatsu as  he stared at the door wistfully. "Really good kisser, too."</p><p>Ranma  paled and left quickly, muttering some unintelligible excuse.</p><p>"What  was all that about?" wondered Ukyo as he left.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"That...   That's just so wrong." Ranma paused for a moment in his hopping  towards the dojo as a cold shiver ran down his spine. "I mean,  sure I've pretended to like guys when I was in my cursed form, but I  wasn't ever really into them, no matter what the stupid curse told my  body. The idea of being with a guy when I am a guy, though... ugh,  now I feel even worse."</p><p>Just  as he was about to continue, a rather familiar chuckle caught his  attention. Just across the street, giggling maniacally and clutching  a single vial of reddish goo rather protectively, was Gosunkugi  Hikaru. "Heh, just what I need to take my mind off the gay stuff;  a chance to dish out a little well-deserved punishment."</p><p>Apparently  too caught up in a premature celebration to notice Ranma's presence,  he failed to dodge away as a hand shot out from behind him, flinging  him into an alley by the back of the head and snatching the vial out  of his hand. When he was released roughly to the ground with a  shove, he looked up from his coughing long enough to realize just who  it was that had him at his mercy. "Ranma! Wait, don't hit me,  I can explain! I wasn't really planning to go to sneak into the  Tendo home and..."</p><p>"Explain  what, Gos-man?" interrupted Ranma with a rather unfriendly  smile. He positioned himself between Hikaru and the street lights,  leaving him only a dark, imposing form of shadow to the smaller boy.  "Are you going to explain to me just how using a magical potion  to enslave someone with love isn't morally deplorable? Or how I  should just let you go so that you can try this kind of crap again in  a few days? Cause if you are, I don't want to hear it."</p><p>Hikaru  tried to fight back with his trusty wooden mallet, but Ranma  intercepted it with a single finger. The boy quaked with fear as it  was reducing it to a smoldering pile of ash and a few inches of  handle with one quick burst of chi. "Wha, what do you want from  me?" he asked, pleadingly, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>"Oh,  nothing much, really." Ranma picked Hikaru up by the front of  his shirt with one hand, lifting him off of his feet and slamming him  firmly against the concrete wall of a small grocery store. "I  just want you to tell me how this potion of yours works."</p><p>"Why  would you want to... Agh!" Gosunkugi yelled as he was slammed  against the wall yet again, bumping his head. He vainly grasped at  Ranma's wrist with both hands but was unable to even make an  indentation in the toned muscles beneath his skin.</p><p>"I  ask questions. You give answers. It's really simple, Gos-man,"  stated Ranma with that cold tone again.</p><p>"It...   It's just a simple love lure, nothing fancy," Hikaru replied  meekly.</p><p>"Do  you have any more of it?" asked Ranma.</p><p>"No,  this is the last of it. Just take it and go, please!" begged  Hikaru.</p><p>"How  do you make the potion only work on one person? I mean, you weren't  really trying to get every guy and girl in town to fall for you,  right?" asked Ranma, loosening his hold slightly as Hikaru began  to cooperate.</p><p>"Uh,  well, all you have to do is put a sample of some sort from the person  you want it to affect into the mixture. Once you do, just apply the  potion to whomever you want that person to fall for, and that's it.  The moment they smell the person with the potion on, it's all over  for them. Simple," he replied carefully. Ranma sat him back on  his feet when he finished.</p><p>"So  all I have to do is take a sample, say a bit of hair..."  Ranma's hand darted out and pulled a few strands of hair from  Hikaru's scalp. As the boy yelped and clutched at the spot, Ranma  continued. "Put it in the mixture, and apply it to someone,  right?"</p><p>"But  why would you..." stated Hikaru, realizing just what had  happened as he looked up to see Ranma replacing the stopper tightly.</p><p>"My  code of honor won't allow me to just kick the shit out of a weakling  like you, so be thankful for that," he explained, juggling the  vial idly. "However, it says nothing about dishing out a little  poetic justice by, say, inflicting your own plot back onto you.  Maybe this time you'll finally learn your lesson."</p><p>"You  wouldn't," declared Hikaru, hoping to call Ranma's bluff.</p><p>"Watch  me," replied Ranma as he backed up his words. With a quick  movement of his hand, he tossed the vial over his shoulder  nonchalantly.</p><p>Except  for one brief reflection in the night sky, it disappeared into the  air, hurtling towards the downtown shopping district. "Hey,  maybe you'll luck out and it won't land on anyone."</p><p>"You,  you monster!" screamed Hikaru as he charged Ranma blindly. His  feeble attempt at a punch was quickly deflected and converted into a  simple one-handed throw across the alleyway.</p><p>"I'm  the monster?" asked Ranma with a derisive snort as he turned  his back on the boy. "At least I left it up to chance as to  whether you were inflicted or not. You, on the other hand, were  planning to inflict this on Akane for your own gain. And then when  your plan fell through you ran, leaving Nabiki to handle it on her  own! If I hadn't found her and been able to resist it, she would  probably have been molested by someone, maybe even Akane!"</p><p>"I,  I didn't mean to..." he whined.</p><p>Ranma  continued, ignoring him. "Heck, if you're lucky you might even  be able to remove the effect before you get a whiff of whoever it  fell on, if it fell on anyone at all."</p><p>"But  it will cost a fortune to get the stuff I'll need to remove its  effects, and I already blew all my savings on the potion itself!"  he complained.</p><p>"What,  and you think that I managed to get Nabiki cured for free? You ain't  getting any pity out of me," replied Ranma casually.</p><p>Ranma  stood in the alleyway for a moment in silence, waiting with his back  turned, until Gosunkugi got up and ran off down the alleyway. "Heh,  that was actually almost as satisfying a fight would have been.  Nabiki's gonna love it when I tell her about this. Judging by the  smell, he even pissed himself!"</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Akane  sat on the couch, looking in the general direction of the TV but not  actually watching it. Instead she replayed the day's events in her  mind, hoping that she wasn't somehow turning into some kind of a  pervert. Was Ranma rubbing off on her?</p><p>"Hey  sis, how was your day? Get chased by any perverts?" asked  Nabiki as she entered the room. Akane jerked very noticeably. "I  know I sure did... guys, girls, heck, even my own sister! What a  day!"</p><p>Akane  began spouting an explanation at incredible speed, blushing furiously  the entire while. "I didn't mean to, I mean, I just kind of had  these weird thoughts all of a sudden, and then you ran, and everyone  else ran, and I just had to chase you! I don't know why!"</p><p>Nabiki  sat down next to her and patted her comfortingly on the shoulder  until she had regained her breath, at which point she held out her  hand expectantly. "1000 yen."</p><p>"For  what? Forgiveness? Information? What?" asked Akane as she  dug in her purse for the requested funds.</p><p>Nabiki  said nothing until the money was in her hand, at which point she  burst out laughing. "Sis, I've got you so trained! All I did  was name a price and hold up my hand, and you forked over the cash  without even knowing why!"</p><p>"Must.   Fight. Urge. To. Kill." Akane chanted. When her efforts to  calm down were thwarted by Nabiki's giggling, she demanded,"Give  it back, then, before I have to hurt you."</p><p>"I'm  home!" called Ranma, sounding much more cheerful than he had  been in the last few days.</p><p>Nabiki  pouted, but did slide away slightly. "Oh, calm down. In answer  to your questions, the answer is both. I forgive you because it  wasn't you, or anybody else in the chase's fault. Remember when  Gosunkugi spilled that stuff on me? It was some kind of love potion  he meant to use on you."</p><p>"You  mean he wanted me to be chased down like that?" asked Akane in  horror.</p><p>Ranma  entered the room in time to hear the comment, and replied, "No,  not exactly. He was going to take a bit of hair from you so that it  would only affect you, and then spill it on himself."</p><p>"Like  that's any better..." the youngest Tendo complained.</p><p>"And  just how do you know that, Ranma? Cologne didn't tell us anything  about how it would be used."</p><p>"Simple,"  he replied with a smirk. "He told me."</p><p>"You  didn't beat him up, did you?" asked Akane with a scowl. "He's  just a weakling, after all."</p><p>"You  beat him up for me, right?" asked Nabiki hopefully.</p><p>He  looked back and forth between the two Tendos for a moment, before  answering, "Not really, no. Just bounced him off a few walls,  scared him till he wet himself." Akane's scowl lessened. "Then  I set it to only affect him, and tossed it off randomly into the  city."</p><p>"Poetic  justice, I like it," replied Nabiki. "But I'm not done  with him yet, not by a long shot."</p><p>"You  shouldn't have done that, Ranma," complained Akane. "I  feel sorry for whoever that lands on."</p><p>"Relax,  Akane. For all you know, it may not have hit anyone, or maybe it  landed on some guy, or just a dog." He stopped for a moment,  and thought before continuing. "Ok, so maybe it was kinda dumb,  but even if it did get on somebody, it's not he could really do  anything to them. Besides, it will only kick in if he smells it. He  ran home, complaining about the cost of making an antidote for  himself, so if that does happen he can always remove the potion's  effects."</p><p>"I  don't care, I still think it was funny," said Nabiki with a  smile.</p><p>"Heck,  if you're lucky he'll come to you for a loan," added Ranma with  a chuckle.</p><p>"Wait  a second... How come you weren't affected, Ranma?" asked Akane,  still not happy about the situation.</p><p>Ranma  didn't answer with anything more than a blush, but Nabiki spoke for  him. "He was, Akane; he was just able to fight it off. I guess  Ranma's built up a bit of a tolerance to love potions, as often as he  gets hit with them."</p><p>"It  did affect you?" said Akane, suspicious. "You had better  not have done anything perverted to my sister, you jerk! You're bad  enough as it is, but who knows how depraved you can get with  something like that affecting you?"</p><p>Ranma  froze up, but Nabiki was once again quick with the answer. "Don't  worry sis, Ranma was a perfect gentleman, as always. He did nothing  more than protect me from certain other perverts." She glanced  at Akane meaningfully, who looked away quickly.</p><p>The  room when silent for a moment, until Ranma stood up and stretched,  making a big show of it. "Damn, hopping around all day sure is  a hell of a lot more tiring than just running everywhere. I'm gonna  go take a nap. Wake me for dinner, Nabiki?" he asked, starting  up the stairs.</p><p>"Sure,  no problem. Least I could do," she replied with a nod.</p><p>"Thanks,"  he said, mouthing 'for everything.'</p><p>"Your  welcome, Ranma," she replied with a smile as she reached for the  remote. "Perfect chance to apologize, sis," she whispered  as she leaned close to Akane.</p><p>"Um,  Ranma?" Akane began, "About yesterday?"</p><p>He  stopped on the stairs for a moment, but did not turn to look at her.  "What about it, Akane? I thought I pretty much spelled that  out."</p><p>"I  just," she fumbled with the words for a moment, "I'm, uh,  sorry for what I said. Really."</p><p>"Are  you?" he asked with a flat tone. "Or will you just fly off  the handle again the next time something happens, just like you  always do?"</p><p>"Really,  I'm sorry," Nabiki nudged her. "I'll, um, try not to jump  to conclusions about you again, Ranma. I promise, even."</p><p>He  looked at her out of the corner of his eye. "Didn't you promise  Kasumi something similar when I first got here? How long did you  keep that promise,  Akane? An hour, maybe?"</p><p>"I  really mean it this time, honest!" she pleaded.</p><p>He  looked down at her with an unreadable expression for a long moment  before speaking. "Apology accepted... this time." He  finished his climb without further comment.</p><p>Akane  began to simmer. "Why did he say 'this time'? Is he still mad at  me or something? Why did he ask Nabiki to wake him up, and not me?  What the heck was he really trying to say at the end?"</p><p>Her  head was spinning with questions, but it was obvious that she would  get no answers here tonight. Frustrated, she decided to just work  off her stress in the dojo... then promptly remembered that wasn't  an option at the moment. Fuming now, she decided that the broken  remains of the fallen dojo would do just a fine job of absorbing her  anger, instead of the usual concrete bricks, just for today.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>He  was trapped in a small prison of stone, about four feet across, in  absolute darkness. He searched franticly for a door, finding only a  cold<br/>metal  pole just above his head and strips of something hanging from it by  metal hooks. The first felt like cloth, the next fur, and next...  some sort of tanned flesh. "Where the hell am I now?" he  bellowed, fearing that Hell was exactly where he was.</p><p>Just  as he was about to try the Bakusai Tenketsu to free himself, light  streamed in from behind him. "You are in the coat closet of the  noble house of Kuno, traveling warrior, although I haven't the  slightest conception of why you would indulge in exploring such a  mundane location when other forms of entertainment abound."</p><p>"Uh,  heh, I knew that. I was just looking for a place to put my backpack.   It's not like I'm lost or anything," he explained, daring his  benefactor to deny his story, or to make fun of him. He would be  more than willing to pound the living shit out of the arrogant  bastard...</p><p>"Indeed?   A suitable notion. Come, noble warrior, I would be pleased if you  would join me in a feast before our eminent defeat of the dreaded  sorcerer, Saotome. I assure you, my sister prepares quite a refined  spread of comestibles, and no doubt one as hearty as yourself can  easily withstand the effects of her more... exotic spices."</p><p>"Yeah,  sure. Food sounds good. I haven't had anything but my camp cooking  in several days," he replied, following the kendoist carefully  to the dining hall. He glanced around occasionally, but never far  enough that Kuno left his peripheral vision, and marveled at the  splendor of the home.</p><p>The  floorboards were dark ancient cedar, polished to a bright luster and  lay as straight as the day they were first cut. The interior walls  were of the typical paper style, but each panel was finely decorated  with watercolor images of samurai in armor standing proudly, all  bearing the same crest, rolling plains of green, and even a majestic  view of Mt. Fuji against the setting sun. The exterior walls were  composed of solid blocks of granite, almost seamlessly joined and  smooth to the touch.</p><p>Everywhere  he looked he saw other signs of extravagance, from freshly cut roses  marking several spots in obviously priceless vases, to the finely  crafted cedar furniture and silver etched trim on the exposed timbers  of the roof.</p><p>Never  before had he seen such a place (well, at least not one that he was  invited into), and he immediately felt a swelling of anger. "Such  extravagant living, all the trappings of comfort and contentment that  had always been denied him... these things would only make a warrior  soft and weak. No wonder this dope always loses to Ranma," he  reasoned.</p><p>The  meal was one of the best he had ever tasted, although his limbs felt  oddly stiff, somehow. The company, however... Well, the host he had  gotten used to on the trip, and as such was not completely annoyed by  his mindless prattle, but the father kept complaining about his hair  and demanding he remove his headbands so he could shave it off. The  sister was even worse, turning out to be none other that the same  bitch that had chained him to Ranma in the middle of a fight, and  repeatedly Akane had mentioned the girl as having attacked her. He  ate his meal in silence, trying to avoid losing his temper while  enjoying the Kunos' hospitality.</p><p>"After  dinner and a bit of evening entertainment, would you care to join me  in a friendly spar? The family Kuno has quite an impressive training  facility, carved from the solid earthly foundations of the estate,"  commented his host as he finished his meal.</p><p>"I  think we should go and find Ranma right now, not waste time," he  replied with a scowl.</p><p>"Ah,  but would it not be fitting for us to rest this eve, and to prepare  for a glorious battle in the light of day, where others might  perceive our victory for the predestined triumph of goodness that it  is?" Tatewaki insisted.</p><p>"You  want to wait around in you plush little castle, fine. I'm going now,  and I don't want to hear any complaints from you when I beat him  first." Ryoga stood up defiantly and turned to leave.</p><p>"This  is foolishness. In the words of Sun Tsu...'If the General is unable  to control his impatience and orders his troops to swarm up the wall  like ants, one-third of them will be killed without taking the  city,'" quoted Tatewaki gravely.</p><p>"I'm  no general, we have no troops, and Ranma is no city, Kuno,"  replied Ryoga as he marched determinedly into the kitchen.</p><p>"Yes?   What do you require, peasant guest of my idiot brother?" asked  Kodachi, looking up from the dirty dishes she was moving to the  washing machine as he entered.</p><p>"Uh,  I just wanted to thank you for your dinner, and to, um, ask just how  the heck I get out of here," he answered quietly.</p><p>"Ah,  yes, now I remember you. The eternally Lost Boy, I believe my  Ranma-sama called you." She smirked at his glower, but  continued speaking.</p><p>"Follow  me, if you must, but please don't touch anything."</p><p>She  led him to the front door, and attempted to retrieve his backpack  from the closet. Unable to lift it, she simply glared at him until  he picked it up himself. "And here we are. The exit from the  house grounds is directly down this path, which does not intersect  any other. Do stay on it, and mind the land mines," she  commented as she pushed him out and closed the door.</p><p>"Land  mines?" he wondered out loud before starting down the path,  keeping his eyes firmly rooted on the path in front of him. He  wandered off into the cool night air, not daring even to blink as he  followed the path.</p><p><b>Author's  notes:</b></p><p>When  I started writing this chapter, I felt kind of bogged down by the  sheer amount of angst that the last two had presented. Hence, the  usual Nerima Chaos comes back in this chapter to lighten the fic up a  bit. The Kuno / Ryoga interlude was originally part of chapter 2,  but was pulled because it just didn't fit the mood. Several  pre-readers liked the scene (even if it didn't quite make sense  originally), so it found a new home here.</p><p>In  case anyone is concerned, the focus of this fic will not be comedy  for any extended length of time. It will be used off and on,  however, along with the occasional fight scene, to keep the drama and  angst from reaching intolerable levels. It just wouldn't be a Ranma  story if there were no laughs, fights, or romantic moments, would it?</p><p>For  the curious, "insider" pre-readers have been briefed on the  overall plotline, while "outsider" pre-readers are without  such knowledge.</p><p>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #2</p><p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered!
