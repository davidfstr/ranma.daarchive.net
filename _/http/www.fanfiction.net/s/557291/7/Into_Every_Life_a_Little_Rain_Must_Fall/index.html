</div><p><b>Into  Every Life, a Little Rain Must Fall<br/></b>A  Ranma 1/2 (manga) fanfic by NemesisZero</p><p><b>Act  3: Shuffling the Deck of Fate</b><br/>Part  2</p><p><b>"Insider"  Pre-readers:</b><br/>Freak  247</p><p><b>"Outsider"  Pre-readers:</b><br/>Aondehafka</p><p><b>Recap  of Last Chapter:</b><br/>Ranma  experienced yet another dream encounter with the mysterious Norou  Mizumei, after which he awoke to find himself lying in a crater  amidst his fallen peers and the remains of the Furinkan High  gymnasium. Trusting Gosunkugi to get help, he ran off in search of a  cure to the potentially fatal condition the other combatants are now  in. His search took him back to the enchanted forest of Ryuganzawa  where he encountered an old rival, Kumon Ryu, and shared a campfire.</p><p>Meanwhile  back in Nerima, things were not proceeding as usual. Nabiki woke  from a vivid nightmare into a waking one, discovering that three days  have passed since Ranma's fight with Kuno and that he had not been  seen or hear of since, prompting her to begin a search immediately.  Other news from the Tendo household involved Akane gaining a deeper  understanding of the true nature of the Anything-Goes School and  Happosai meeting his end at the hands of an unidentified assailant.</p><p>Ukyo  continued to run her restaurant despite injuries while Tsubasa made  his escape from Azusa's clutches and the other half of the Golden  Pair experimented with alternate lifestyle choices. Both Tatewaki  and Kodachi, with help from the Amazons (sans a comatose Cologne) and  Taro, respectfully, finally learned of the existence of Jusenkyo  curses through very different methods. They reacted quite poorly to  the insinuation that Ranma and the Pigtailed Girl are one and the  same, however.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>The  late morning air was a bit chilly and damp, but not uncomfortably so.   Last night's rain turned the battered yard into a giant mud pit.  Seeing several large puddles about the yard had him quite concerned,  but at least she wouldn't want to do any sparring with her  injuries, and hence he could safely stay on the wooden walkway.  There was a larger concern on Ryoga's mind at the moment though,  one that did not threaten him so much as it did her.</p><p>"Are  you really sure you want to learn this stuff Akane?" he asked,  seriously. "Chi attacks aren't just another technique to master  like a punch or kick, there's a much more personal side to it.  Doing one means looking deep into the parts of yourself you wish  weren't there and sort of throwing them out into the open. Even  after all the emotional stuff you have to remember that throwing  blasts too often or too large can leave you really sluggish for a  while, more open to attack."</p><p>"Yeah,  yeah..." Akane replied, waving her good hand dismissively. "Of  course I'm sure, Ryoga. This could be just what I need to get an  edge on the others and spur myself back into some serious training.  I'm not afraid of facing up to anything in my subconscious."</p><p>Ryoga  sighed and shook his head wearily. "You don't understand, Akane.   Using these techniques... it changes you. Ever since I learned the  Shi-Shi Hokodan it's been harder and harder to keep my spirits up  for any length of time. I was a bit melancholy before, but now there  are times when I'm sure that if I didn't have someo... er,  -something- I still had to do I might just sink so deep into  depression that I'd never crawl out again."</p><p>"Ryoga...  I never knew," she whispered, putting a hand on his shoulder as he  blushed slightly. "Defeating Ranma must really mean quite a bit to  you."</p><p>"Er,  of course," he replied too quickly, "That's what rivals are  for."</p><p>She  smiled. "Still, I don't think it will be that much of a problem  for me, Ryoga. I could always try and concentrate on something  positive instead, like Ranma does with confidence."</p><p>His  blush faded into a rather stern frown. "There's nothing positive  about Ranma's Moko Takabisha attack either, Akane. If it's based  on confidence like he says, then it's more likely that he's only  feeding his overconfidence by using it. I'd say that Ranma's ego  has grown steadily since he learned that technique. His  overconfidence almost got you killed in Jusendo when he insisted on  being the one to hold you and then fighting Saffron, and he was  acting like a complete ass every time I saw him last week." ...Not  to mention what effects the angry red tones in his blasts lately  might cause, or whatever emotion is driving that black thing.</p><p>That  last statement seemed to have given her pause, for Akane stood  silently for a moment in thought. At length, and with a bit of  trepidation, she inquired, "But does that mean that chi attack  necessarily has to be based on something negative? I mean, I though  the emotion was only a way to focus the chi, but that it didn't  really matter once you threw it."</p><p>"Well,  that's a tricky one to answer," Ryoga admitted. "I think my  perfect Shi-Shi Hokodan acts the way it does because of the  depression used to form it, but since I've never seen anyone else  use a purely chi-based attack as large based on something else I  can't say for sure. I'm pretty sure that the emotion used  affects the color of the blast though, since mine are always a shade  of blue and Ranma's are usually orange."</p><p>"As  far as negative emotions being necessary goes," he continued, "I'm  not entirely sure either. If the chi is formed by emotion, I think  that the emotion used has a lot to do with how that chi reacts with  others. If you want to do harm you need an emotion that is harmful;  an emotion like friendship or compassion would be better suited to a  technique used to heal."</p><p>Akane  stood up a little straighter, with her lips tightened and her  nostrils flared, as she declared, "Well, I suppose I'll just have  to learn to control it then. I'll never get any better if I'm  too afraid of the consequences to try."</p><p>Ryoga  matched her determined eyes. "Very well, Akane. I'll show you  the steps to my chi attack, but I want you to try and find a  different emotion to base your attack on, something better suited to  your personality and hopefully less harmful to you than mine is. I  also want you to promise me something though, Akane; that you won't  use your chi attack unless you have no other option."</p><p>"I  promise, but only if you do too, Ryoga." Akane replied. "I don't  want you to keep hurting yourself either."</p><p>He  thought for a moment and tried, unsuccessfully, to count the number  of times he'd considered suicide since learning the technique. He  then tried to count the number of times that using the technique as  anything but a final recourse had actually helped him in a fight, and  was forced to admit to himself that it was a rather small number.</p><p>With  a resigned sigh, he nodded. "For both our sakes, I promise. Once  you've recovered a bit maybe we can try and figure out a better way  to use them, one that doesn't hurt anyone but the target. I could  be wrong, but that dragon prince guy used white chi for all his  attacks, and it didn't feel like there was an emotion involved in  making them. I think that he was pulling in chi from outside of  himself to boost his attacks."</p><p>"It's  agreed then!" Akane stated with a wide smile. "You'll be my  sensei, and while we're training we can try and improve upon the  technique together. Boy, won't Ranma be surprised when we can do  something he can't!"</p><p>He  was a bit doubtful on that last note, but Ryoga found her almost  giddy attitude contagious. "Alright Akane, I'll give you a  demonstration, up close and as slow as I can manage. Pay close  attention."</p><p>"Yes,  sensei," she replied eagerly from a few feet to his right side as  he took a wide stance with his arms crossed in front of his chest.</p><p>"First,  you have to concentrate on your chosen focus emotion." Images of  his last, very humiliating defeat at Ranma's hands in this very  yard a few days ago immediately sprang to mind. Through gritted  teeth, he continued, "Choose an image or thought and keep replaying  it in your head until you almost can't stand it anymore. Once  you've got it stuck, let your battle aura form."</p><p>Ryoga  closed his eyes tightly, fighting to keep the power level contained  to a just a small blast as he went through the process slowly and  meticulously, the image of Ranma's smirking face just before he  released his final attack firmly logged in his brain. His aura burst  forth almost uncontrollably in a wave of flame-like tendrils that  felt slightly painful on his skin. "Next you have to will it to  gather into one spot. I try to imagine it wrapping around itself in  thin streamers, like a tightly wound ball of string."</p><p>The  energy began to coalesce into a brightly glowing spot between his  arms and just in front of his chest. His head began to throb with  his heartbeat, and cold sweat was dripping off of his brow. As the  ball grew his stomach and bowels cramped painfully. "As it  finishes solidifying, gather it between your hands and prepare to  throw it," he instructed, pulling the ball and both his hands down  with a slow motion to rest at the right side of his gut.</p><p>The  burning sensation was intensifying in his palms, moving beyond a  simple stinging into genuine pain. A wave of dizziness washed over  him, and he felt a sudden sharp pain in his side nearest the ball.  He realized that something was definitely wrong with doing this  technique slowly, and as a bit of fear grew in his mind the tint of  the ball changed from grayish blue to a yellowish green. Still, he  was determined to show her the technique in this manner to make it  easier for her to copy, even if that meant some discomfort on his  part.</p><p>"Finally,"  he stated in shaky tones between uneven breaths, "Release your pain  toward your target, and be free of its burden!" Ryoga thrust his  hands toward the pile of remaining wreckage of the dojo, but the chi  blast did not shoot away as he expected it to. Instead, it exploded  between his fingers, throwing him violently backward in an  uncontrolled flipping motion. The motion stopped when he crashed  into the wall of the house upside down and face first, then crumpled  to the ground.</p><p>Through  the haze of approaching unconsciousness, he heard Akane speaking to  him. "Ryoga? Ryoga, answer me!" She shook him by the shoulder,  but he could not find the strength of will to open his eyes or reply.   It was getting harder to hear her, and his side felt warm and wet.</p><p>"Oh  my god, someone call a doctor!"</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>It  was exactly 12:07. Sato Toji was now seven minutes late.</p><p>He  lowered his watch quickly and disdainfully, but was forced to squint  as glare reflecting off of the device's face cruelly assaulted his  sleep-deprived senses. Tatewaki rubbed his pained eyes and leaned  back against the front wall of the small downtown restaurant that  Toji had chosen as their meeting place.</p><p>It  was a rather warm day, he noted as he stifled a yawn, and quite  pleasantly devoid of rain, though a few large, pillow-like clouds  were still drowsily making their aimless way across the otherwise  spotless sky. The sidewalk was faintly buzzing with traffic, ranging  from passers-by to the occasional customer to the store, though not  enough to truly make one feel crowded. The easy flow of friendly  conversation from these pedestrians blended together, if one chose to  simply close their eyes for a moment and listen passively, into an  almost hypnotic easy drone of white noise. A delightful smell of  foodstuffs from within the store wafted out to him whenever the door  was opened which filled him with a faintly satisfied sensation...</p><p>"Um,  Kuno-Sempai?"</p><p>Tatewaki  snapped his eyes open immediately and jerked slightly away from the  wall against which he had been reclining. Stretching his shoulders  slightly, he glanced at his watch which told him the time was now  12:26. Pushing through the remaining lethargic fog in his mind he  stated sarcastically, "So, Mr. Sato, you finally choose to grace me  with your presence specifically at this most opportune moment."</p><p>"I  apologize for my tardiness, Captain," Toji said with a moderate  bow. "My new girlfriend, Hitomi, asked me for help with her  homework. Her spoken language skills are passable, but I'm afraid  she hasn't learned much of the written language yet."</p><p>"Cease  your prattle of excuses; I care not for the troubles of this  half-western girl of yours," the senior kendoist replied coldly.  "Pray tell, are you aware of the reason for this meeting?"</p><p>"I...  no, actually I don't know why you asked me to meet with you today,  sir. Any business dealing with the team would most efficiently have  been handled before our joint practice next week with the Kolkhoz  team, and to be honest we've never had any social dealings outside  of kendo." Toji continued as his senior stifled yet another yawn,  "If it would be more convenient for you we could arrange to meet  again at a later time. Perhaps when you are more fully rested?"</p><p>Kuno's  eyes narrowed at the slightly shorter boy. "I assure you I am  abundantly capable of conducting this gathering now, Mr. Sato. Your  newfound doting maiden will simply have to improve her intimacy with  the virtue of patience." He pressed on, ignoring the slight  stammer of his subordinate, "That which we shall discus today is of  both a personal and a sporting nature. As my second, I thought to  come to you before discussing the matter in a less discrete theater."</p><p>"Ah,  so it is a matter you would prefer to keep from becoming public,"  Toji replied with a nod. "If I may be of assistance, Captain,  please do not hesitate to ask. You can trust me to act only in your  best interests."</p><p>Tatewaki  continued, "It is precisely on this topic that my concern is  centered, Sato. I am curious on the topic of potential ways in which  you may have acted in my 'best interests' previously without  consulting me prior to said incident."</p><p>"I  don't understand your line of questioning, Captain," the smaller  young man replied.</p><p>The  senior explained, "During my recent bout with Saotome I noticed a  particular lack of knowledge on his part concerning the rules and  regulations of the event. Were you not assigned to insure that he  was properly prepared for the match?"</p><p>Sato  balked slightly at the insinuation. "I tried my best to teach  Ranma the regulations but he was too impatient to listen to me! He  ignored the majority of what I told him and left before I was  finished explaining it all!"</p><p>"Hmm..."  Kuno considered for a moment, turning aside for a moment, "Yes,  that does quite have the ring of Saotome's typical behavior about  it."</p><p>"Is  that all you wished to discuss today?" Sato asked hopefully.</p><p>"Still,"  Tatewaki continued, ignoring the question, "you obviously did not  put forth enough effort in impressing upon my foe the importance of  the various regulations of the challenge. I am not at all pleased to  have won our match in such a... technical... fashion."</p><p>"But  a win is always better than a loss, right?" the subordinate offered  with a slightly nervous air.</p><p>"No,  Toji, it is not so in every case." Kuno paused for a moment before  asking, "Tell me, do you believe I would have come out unfavorably  in this confrontation were it not for Saotome's lack of knowledge?"</p><p>Sato's  jaw line set solidly. "To be quite frank sir, you haven't beaten  Ranma in a fight before now. If I were in your position, with such a  long history of trouble, I would gladly claim a win in any way that I  could."</p><p>"Would  you?" Tatewaki demanded. "Would you allow yourself the  ill-gained satisfaction of a victory not claimed through skill but  rather through circumstances? Would not such a victory cheapen in  your mind any results of that confrontation even if love, that most  precious of all heavenly gifts, were precisely what was at stake?"</p><p>Toji  remained firm if not outright defiant. "I can't elaborate on  that point, Captain. What I can say, however, is that the team as a  whole was glad to see you finally defeat him and restore some much  needed respect to our ranks."</p><p>"Am  I to believe that my fellows blame my recent difficulties for our  declining status?" Kuno demanded, leaning into the space of his  second. "That they saw my personal failures as their captain as a  weakness to be removed from their ranks?"</p><p>"Yes."  Toji admitted ruefully, looking away.</p><p>"Enough  so that they believed that the highest form of cheating, in the very  sport for which they profess admiration through their willing social  participation no less, to be their best recourse?"</p><p>"What...  What do you mean, Captain?" Toji replied, backing slightly away as  his superior produced a bokken from the folds of his deeply pleated  pants.</p><p>"Saotome's  protective gear," was Kuno's sole reply.</p><p>Sato  Toji was quiet for a moment, but finally decided to growl in  response, "Yes, damn it, we tampered with his gear. I admit it  only because we did so for your sake and for the preservation of what  little respect our team still holds despite your constant public  losses and ridiculous antics. We decided as a team when you told us  about your plan that this would be the final chance you would have to  prove yourself worthy of our service."</p><p>"Then  may I assume that you fancied the notion of ascending to my position  if I failed?" Tatewaki asked, raising his bokken to a two handed  fighting grip.</p><p>Toji  eyed the bokken but did not back down. "I'll still have no  trouble taking the position from you if you strike me now, Kuno. I  have no doubt that the Kolkhoz's athletic department will be far  less sympathetic to your behavior than our school's was, on account  of your father."</p><p>"Give  this message to the rest of your team then, Sato Toji," Kuno  demanded, raising his bokken high above his head. He then shifted his  grip to the ends of the wooden implement, and then brought it down  level to Toji's eyes. With a mighty show of strength he bent the  weapon until it shattered, spraying splinters across the sidewalk,  quickly followed by flinging the broken halves at his former  teammates' feet.</p><p>"Tell  them that they are not worthy of my leadership," Kuno spat angrily.   "Tell them that they have disgraced themselves and everything this  team ever stood for. Lastly, tell them that I will be making this  incident very public indeed." He finished by spitting on the  shattered remains and turning away from the presence of his former  second.</p><p>"Like  anyone will ever believe your word against ours, you complete  embarrassment," the younger boy sneered derisively as he walked  away. "You just try it and see what it gets you!"</p><p>Tatewaki  declined to reply, steadfastly ignoring the continued existence of  this individual until he had left the area. Feeling the presence  depart at last he reopened his eyes to look sadly at the ruined  splinters of his bokken. With a sigh he turned from the remains and  began his journey back to his not-at-all humble abode and some much  needed rest.</p><p>He  hadn't even taken a second step, however, before he was forced to  roll to the side in order to dodge a jump kick from above with enough  force behind it to pierce the sidewalk.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Removing  his foot from the rubble of now vacant pavement, he turned to face  his target. "It wasn't very wise to disarm yourself, fool," he  admonished his target.</p><p>The  slightly older boy recovered from his rolling dodge into a crouching  defensive stance a few meters away, turned at an angle and with his  hands held open and unevenly before him. "Forgive my ignorance  then; I thought I hadn't scheduled any cowardly attacks this  afternoon."</p><p>"Neither  your broken weapon nor your ignorance will protect you from me,  Japanese boy," Mousse smirked as he brought his hands together  before his chest, both completely hidden by his flowing grey robe.  "You can swear off your attachment to Shampoo now or wait until  after I beat it out of you; it makes no difference to me."</p><p>Kuno's  gaze didn't waver, though his hands shifted to a slightly lower  position. "You waste your time, 'fowl' one. I will not be  threatened by the likes of you."</p><p>"Then  be killed by the likes of me!" Mousse howled, leaping high and  towards his unarmed opponent. He willed his chi to shift as he  reached the apex of his jump, envisioning several lengths of spiked  chain in his mind as his flung both his sleeves forward. Rather than  the slightly empty feeling he usually expected when using his hidden  weapons techniques, however, there was instead a wave of nausea and  burning pain in his arms. In a briefly detached moment of thought he  realized that it was the same sensation that had thrown off his aim  the last time he attacked this boy.</p><p>His  thoughts snapped quickly back to the present when he realized that  the chains had not flown at his target at all, leaving him in the  rather awkward position of jumping with open arms at his target.  With a twist of his arms and torso at the last moment he managed to  alter his jump into a spinning heel kick, but the older boy merely  ducked the improvised attack and retaliated with a stiff double palm  strike to the back before his feet found purchase.</p><p>Now  it was his turn to tuck and roll, negating the potentially painful  fall. Springing back to his feet he found his opponent still stiffly  poised, awaiting his next attack with a silent glare. Already the  phantom pain in his arms was fading, but the slight discomfort in his  stomach remained. He attempted to strike again, this time picturing  several small throwing darts with bright red streamers on their  handles as he threw his sleeve-covered arms forward. With an  unexpected sharp pain the projectiles emerged from his sleeves as  expected, but with only enough force behind them to clatter along the  pavement to his opponent's feet.</p><p>"This  technique seems doomed to failure, miscreant," Kuno intoned as he  gazed momentarily at the pathetic attempt at an attack that now lay  at his feet. "Perhaps you should try something different?"</p><p>"Don't  presume to lecture me on tactics, fool!" the Amazon snarled as he  charged, closing the distance with a jumping snap kick. His opponent  leaned back to avoid the strike and quickly slap-parried the next two  follow-up punches. A feint knee strike opened up the older boy's  guard enough for a left hook to land a glancing blow, but his next  attack, a spinning leg sweep, was countered effectively by simply  moving the front leg above the kick and then using it to kick the  Amazon in the chest.</p><p>Mousse  blocked the kick with both arms but it was still hard enough to  topple him. He rolled backwards from his opponent and sprang back to  his feet with a counterstrike, but found that the older boy had not  moved to pursue at all. Instead he resumed his former crouching  posture and seemed to be simply waiting.</p><p>"Why  don't you attack?" the robed boy snarled as he charged in with a  straight punch. Kuno stepped inside the arc of the swing, grabbed  the attacker's robe with both hands, and pivoted at the waist to  toss him several meters. Twisting in the air, however, Mousse  managed to get his feet back under him before he landed. Without  pausing he rebounded, offering a jumping lunge kick feint that, with  a violent twist, became a flying roundhouse.</p><p>Caught  unprepared, Tatewaki reeled with the blow and staggered back several  steps. He quickly took up his defensive posture yet again, but this  time his left arm, the closer of the two to his body, was held at a  much lower position that no longer effectively blocked his head.  "Finish what you started," Kuno commanded with an unblinking  stare.</p><p>Sensing  a weakness in his opponent's guard, Mousse pressed in to throw a  quick snap-punch one-two combination. The first strike was  predictably blocked but the second snuck past the kendoist's arms  to collide with his chin. The older boy rolled with the punch but  quickly recovered, capturing this overextended arm at the wrist with  his left hand and pulling it farther across his chest to draw his  opponent's face stiffly into his right elbow.</p><p>Mousse  twisted away from the grip on his left hand easily enough, but now  found an iron hard grasp on his right wrist. As Kuno swung his now  free left hand to strike, Mousse reactedby throwing his leg fully  over his opponent's grappling arm as he leaned his torso out of  reach of the kendoist's swing, then delivered a snap kick from the  knee into his opponent's surprised face. The blow was apparently  successful only in angering his target, who promptly grabbed the  offending leg, kicked the other hard at the ankle and simultaneously  pulled down sharply on the grappled arm to throw the Amazon  forcefully to the street, face-first.</p><p>Now  without his glasses, still slightly dazed from the impact and held by  two limbs, Mousse twisted his hips to attempt a scissors kick on his  opponent's head. The blow missed when Kuno instead chose to drop  to a knee behind him, but at least the maneuver allowed him to free  his leg.</p><p>As  Mousse brought his legs back underneath him to regain some leverage  he felt his arm jerked straight up against his ear by the wrist.  Suddenly the grip was released in favor of an arm position across his  straightened elbow ending with Kuno's wrist firmly pressed against  the back of his neck as his adversary's free hand came around from  the side to press in a similar fashion against his windpipe.</p><p>"Did  you perchance believe me defenseless without my chosen tool?" Kuno  asked smugly as he increased the pressure of the choke, obviously not  caring for an answer. "In the wisdom of samurai long departed it  was noted that even the best warrior might once be caught without his  blade, and for just such a circumstance it is vital to train in an  unarmed style as well as in mastery of the sword."</p><p>Mousse  flailed now, searching for a way to break the hold. His right arm  was held straight up, pinned against both his own head, his  opponent's chin, and braced at the elbow. His left arm was free  but could only find his opponent's right shoulder and left arm  within striking distance, and quickly discovered that a blow to  either spot resulted in a jolt to his already straining neck.  Pulling on the arm choking from the front was responded to by his  opponent shifting his weight forward, alleviating none of the  pressure and adding pain to his back. Any attempt to push off with  his legs was met by a twisting of the torso that left his feet once  again without leverage and caused yet another jolt to his neck.</p><p>"Were  I in such a position I would resign myself to defeat," Kuno  recommended seriously. "There is but one open way to freedom and  treading this path can only end in pronounced suffering, I assure  you."</p><p>The  Amazon's mind whirled furiously even as tiny black and purplish  spots began to dance across his blurred vision. He was beginning to  feel lightheaded and his lungs burned for air. "What can I do?"  his mind screamed. "My arms are useless and so are my legs. I  can't twist away from it, can't afford to wait it out, and can't  get enough leverage to break his grip. All I can really move is  my... head..."</p><p>Closing  his eyes against the now rather large drifting spots, Mousse quickly  turned his head to the side and jerked his neck to the right,  slipping between the slight gap of his adversary's hands. He  immediately took a gasping breath as he continued to pull his body to  the right with all the strength he could muster.</p><p>Kuno  replied to the move, however, by twisting the younger man's right  arm behind his back and locking it in a partially bent position with  both arms. With just a slight forward shift from the waist Tatewaki  forced the Amazon to fall forward onto his other shoulder heavily.  Softly grumbling "You were warned," he braced a knee against the  amazon's back and wrenched his weight backwards in a sharp jerk,  accompanied by two sickeningly rough, grinding pops.</p><p>"AAARRRHHHGGHH!"  was the only reply that seemed appropriate to Mousse at the moment as  his arm erupted in searing pain from both his elbow and shoulder. He  rapidly crawled away from his opponent on all three functioning  limbs, putting some distance between them before he regained his  footing, shakily.</p><p>"Do  you yield," his opponent asked wearily, "or must I cripple you  further?"</p><p>His right arm was completely useless now, merely a dead weight at his  side that continued to scream in agony. His vision was spotty at  best and blurred beyond recognition of anything more than street and  sky. His breath was rapid and uneven. His heart was pounding so  fiercely that he could barely hear. Despite all this, Mousse found  the will to roar, "Never! I'll die before admitting defeat to  you!"</p><p>He  bent low at both the knees and waist as he flung his good arm back,  calling forth a plain but sturdy Chinese blade of forged steel. The  flesh of his forearm tore as the weapon emerged with a spray of  crimson, and despite the blood-slicked condition of the handle he  held on to it desperately. With a wordless howl he charged at the  nearest blurred form and swung.</p><p>Before  the swing connected with anything, however, a swift kick to his  unguarded throat launched him off of his feet and through the wall of  a nearby business, the sword falling free of his grip to skitter  across the pavement with a metallic ringing tone.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Um,  excuse me, but the doctors want me to ask a few questions about  Mr...," the rather plain, brown-haired nurse asked in a soothing,  gentle voice, now stopping to check something on the notepad she  carried, "Mr. Hibiki, and just what happened to him."</p><p>Kasumi looked away from the uniformed woman, turning her head  slightly to the side and down at her sister, the only actual witness  to his injuries, who sat next to her in the row of rather  uncomfortable and thinly cushioned chairs that lined the waiting room  walls.</p><p>"It  was some sort of accident," Akane began to explain, wringing her  hands in her lap. "Ryoga was just showing me one of his martial  arts maneuvers."</p><p>"Did  you see where the shot came from?" the nurse asked, adopting a sort  of almost-kneeling posture to bring herself down to Akane's eye  level.</p><p>Kasumi  let her gaze wander about the room slightly, taking note of the few  changes that had been made since she had last been in this room,  waiting, worrying, and hoping for a life to be spared. The formerly  pale green walls had been repainted in a light and soothing cream  tone, the once glaring florescent lighting gave way to indirect track  lighting focused on a tile mosaic image of the hospital as seen from  the air, and several small television sets (muted, of course) had  been added about the waiting area.</p><p>"No,  nobody attacked him, it was a training accident," Akane explained,  somewhat confused.</p><p>The  nurse put her hand over Akane's in a soothing manner. "Please,  it's very important that you tell us exactly what happened. The  doctors are quite confused by his injuries and really need to know  just what exactly they are dealing with."</p><p>"Ryoga...  he was just showing me how to do one of his special techniques, one  that projects chi as a method of attack. He looked like he was  struggling a bit to keep it under control so I could see it in slow  motion. I mean, at the time I didn't think anything of it. Just  that it was a part of the move, you know?" Akane shook her head  and sniffled slightly before continuing. "When he tried to finish  it though, the ball of chi... It just exploded, right there in his  hand. It just caught him right in the face..."</p><p>The  carpet and chairs, however, were just as Kasumi remembered them. The  air was just the same as she remembered it also, slightly cooler than  comfortable and with the scent of cleaning agents slightly  noticeable. The box of toys that Nabiki and Akane had played with  while they waited still sat against the far wall, next to the  magazine rack. She had no more inclination to sample either now than  she did last time.</p><p>"Um,  let's just say there was a small explosion and leave it at that,  eh?" The nurse replied with a slight twitch, erasing something on  her notes. "So I guess that would explain the burns and the  concussion..."</p><p>"Actually,  miss, the young man had received the concussion a few days ago,"  Soun clarified. "He was in the gymnasium of Furinkan High with my  daughter."</p><p>"Ohh...  that is a very important fact to consider," the woman replied,  taking quick notes. "So the injury to his side was reopened by the  blast? Except for being unable to find the bullet we had assumed it  was a gunshot wound... either that or his appendix somehow managed to  explode through his side on its own."</p><p>Mr.  Saotome shifted his bulk in his chair once again, trying in vain to  find a comfortable spot before returning his attention to the silent  television. Kasumi knew that she should be thinking of Ryoga rather  than digging up old memories, but still it bothered her to see this  man so completely uninvolved in the events occurring around him.  Feeling somewhat guilty, she returned her full attention to her  sister.</p><p>Akane  looked up sharply with wet eyes. "But, he didn't have an injury  to his side from the roof collapse, just a concussion."</p><p>"Then  how did Mr. Hibiki receive the wound to his side? The soft tissue  damage goes too deep to be explained away by anything short of a  bullet wound or perhaps a car accident, but then the bruising would  be far more widespread, and neither explains the second degree burns  on his face, his hands, and trailing from his upper chest to his  right side," the nurse persisted.</p><p>"I...  I don't know what happened to his side. I went to check on him  after the explosion, but," Akane sniffled again and rubbed her  eyes, "where I placed my hand, it... blood, so much blood. I  couldn't, I just, I..." Akane jerked her hands out from under  the woman's and latched onto her father's shoulder as best she  could with her injured shoulder still held immobile, crying openly  now.</p><p>"Perhaps  it would be best if you came back later, Miss," Soun stated, moving  to hold Akane in a loose embrace.</p><p>"Yes,  that would be appropriate," the nurse agreed, standing up. "Our  staff is one of the best in Tokyo, miss. I'm fairly sure Mr.  Hibiki will pull through."</p><p>Akane  only continued to sob.</p><p>Genma  looked at his friend's situation somewhat uncomfortably for a  moment before rising as well. "I, um, think I'll check up on the  master, as long as we're here and all... make sure he hasn't  caused too much trouble." With his usual heavy gait he plodded up  to the main desk and began talking with the older woman seated there.   After a moment a young man in scrubs and a white overcoat came to  the desk and led him down a hallway to the left. Curious,  considering that the elevators were on the right side of the lobby...</p><p>"I  should have stopped him," Akane said in a low voice, still crying  lightly. "I just knew something wasn't right with him when I  heard how strained his voice was getting, but I didn't say  anything. Why didn't I say something?"</p><p>Kasumi  added her own hand to Akane's back, a comforting gesture that still  felt hollow to her somehow. She wanted to offer condolences for this  accident, to feel sorry about what had happened, but was simply  unable to shake off the lingering disconnected sense of her  surroundings and her last memories of mother.</p><p>She  realized that her emotions had been odd of late, even perhaps  erratic, ever since Ranma destroyed the dojo. No, she corrected  herself; she had been feeling a vague unease all that day, even  before the wedding attempt. From the moment Akane, Ranma, and Mr.  Saotome walked in the door some silent warning had been set off, some  unperceived shift in the proper harmony in the home. Since their  return Akane had been even more moody than normal. Mr. Saotome had  been cautious, occasionally glancing at Ranma as if he expected to  see something different. Ranma himself...</p><p>Kasumi  shuddered suddenly, feeling as the room was suddenly much colder if  only for a second. Even with him gone she couldn't think of him  without getting an intangible sense of impending danger, an  overwhelming gut reaction that demanded she get him away from those  she loved as soon as possible and by any means necessary. Was this  latest accident still more fallout from that sense of danger? Was  this the end of it, or merely the beginning of something much larger?</p><p>At  least now that he wasn't immediately present she could reflect upon  her behavior and admit that it was both illogical and even cruel.  Still, she felt oddly justified despite a strong inclination that she  had done a great wrong to the young man. Her hunches had always been  right before, but never had they left her with any lingering doubts,  nor had they so completely driven her without offering her time to  consider...</p><p>Her  reverie was cut off as Mr. Saotome returned to the room, walking over  to his seat with an oddly stoic set to his jaw. With slow, even  movements he sat down and turned to look over at her, at Akane who  had stopped crying, and at her father who returned the look with  puzzlement. "I have news," he began, hesitantly, "although I'm  not sure yet whether it is good or bad."</p><p>"What  is it, old friend?" her father asked.</p><p>"The  master has expired," Genma announced without fanfare, "Apparently  from a heart attack early this morning. They were trying to call me  the whole time we've been here waiting."</p><p>Akane  began to cry again, stopped short, then apparently decided instead to  just look down into her lap quietly.</p><p>Soun  put a hand on his friend's shoulder but his expression didn't  change otherwise.</p><p>"God  only knows what Nodoka's reaction will be," Genma sighed, closing  his eyes for a moment. "It was strange though; even considering  his state his chi was incredibly faint... I think even the cold metal  table had more lingering energy in it."</p><p>Kasumi  wanted to say something, but her voice caught in her throat. She was  unable to truly feel any sorrow for the perverse but otherwise kind  old man. Reaching up to hold her small silver cross pendant in her  hand tightly, she silently wondered which facet of the experience was  actually worse; Happosai's death, or her family's collective  inability to grieve for him.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"What  are you up to, Kuno baby?" Nabiki asked as she approached the  restaurant, which, for reasons unknown, seemed to be under the  protection of Tatewaki Kuno, moron at large. He stood casually,  leaning next to the doors of her destination with his arms crossed.</p><p>"Zzzzz,"  he replied, followed by a snort. One hand came up to scratch at his  nose, but quickly returned to its resting place across his chest.</p><p>Rationalizing  that the idiot's sleeping arrangements weren't her problem,  Nabiki simply shrugged and entered the restaurant without disturbing  him. She had more important matters to attend to, after all.</p><p>"Welcome  to Ucchan's!" the ninja waitress nearly squealed as he sprang  into her awareness suddenly. "Would you like a seat at the grill  today, Miss Tendo?"</p><p>If  not for living with the Saotomes for the past two years, she might  have actually jumped at the surprise. Instead she replied simply, "I  have some business to attend to today, but until my appointment  arrives I suppose it couldn't hurt." She followed the  kimono-clad young man through the half-filled restaurant to a  cushioned stool at the countertop island.</p><p>"What  can I get for ya, sugar?" the owner asked, looking up from the  grill with a smile.</p><p>"A  pork and pineapple, medium size, with tea," she replied, settling  herself on the seat. She then held out her hand and, with a smile,  stated, "100 yen. It's not anything big, but you will want to  know it anyway."</p><p>"I'll  take it off your bill," Ukyo replied, "so out with it already."</p><p>"Did  you know that Kuno is sleeping outside next to your door?" Nabiki  began genially, retracting her hand. "His presence and reputation  might be scaring away potential customers."</p><p>The  chef growled slightly, "Konatsu, go tell that jackass to either buy  something or take a hike."</p><p>"Yes,  mistress Ukyo," the waitress replied from... somewhere in the room.</p><p>"I  hate it when he does that," the chef whispered, shaking her head.</p><p>Nabiki  smirked in reply. "Heh, Ranma does that sort of 'intensive  stealth training' nonsense at least once a week at the dojo. It  really annoys the heck out of Akane."</p><p>The  chef's eyes clearly wanted to reply, "So what doesn't?" but  what came out of her mouth was instead the more somber question,  "Have you had any luck finding Ranchan yet?" She set an  inexpensive but attractively decorated tea cup before the older girl.</p><p>Nabiki  had to look away to hide her expression at the question, and found  that examining the cup made a convenient excuse. "No," she  almost sighed, "nothing concrete yet, anyway. It's an almost  certain bet that he survived the incident, considering the complete  lack of fatalities, but I haven't been able to find even a hint of  his current whereabouts."</p><p>"Mr.  Kuno is awake now and is away from the door, mistress," Konatsu  announced, appearing just long enough to pick up several completed  orders.</p><p>"He  had better not have decided to run away," Ukyo replied darkly,  placing the ordered okonomiyaki before her customer. "I really  don't want to have to spend another ten years hunting him down...  I honestly don't think I could go through another stretch like that  again."</p><p>"Relax,  Kuonji, he's sure to show up sooner or later," Nabiki reassured  between bites, though whether she was reassuring the cook or herself  was debatable. "His overdeveloped sense of duty won't let him  take the easy way out of here."</p><p>"Yeah,  you're right... I just get an antsy feeling whenever I don't see  him for any length of time. Every time Ranchan leaves town I feel  like he's ditching me by the roadside again." Ukyo sniffed  lightly, wiping her eyes quickly with her sleeve.</p><p>Nabiki  felt some measure of pity for the girl standing across from her, but  would not allow herself the luxury of expressing her concern.  Instead she offered a little bit of hope before going back to eating.   "Actually, I've got a meeting with someone soon who claims they  have some information on Ranma. I'd rather not see the little  twerp at the moment, honestly, but he wouldn't agree to talk about  it with any of my proctors."</p><p>Ukyo  slid a plain white envelope across the counter to her customer as she  finished her meal. "My share of the dojo fund," she explained,  "and lunch is on the house... provided you share anything you find  out today."</p><p>The  Tendo girl faltered for a moment, her conscience warring with her  financial instincts. Noticing the arrival of her appointment,  however, gave her a compromise. With a secretive smile she replied,  "It's a deal... but put my meal on Hikaru's tab instead, okay?  The little bastard owes me big and I aim to drag out his dept for as  long as possible this time."</p><p>"Hmm,  Ranchan mentioned your little mishap the last time we talked," the  chef replied with a wink. "Consider it done."</p><p>"Ghuud  tu saa yuu, Nhabake," Gosunkugi said with a slight bow. "Whur  shull wu sat?"</p><p>Nabiki  glared at the boy with her arms crossed.</p><p>"Whudd?"  he asked, clueless.</p><p>"Take  that ridiculous thing off right this instant or I'm leaving," She  stated firmly.</p><p>"Bhud  I naad et tull tha patiun whurs aff," he complained.</p><p>Nabiki  remained quiet as she rose from her seat. She was fully prepared to  walk out, but Ukyo choose to end the nonsense by pulling the bright  pink plastic clothespin off of the scrawny boy's nose, not  bothering to unclasp it first.</p><p>"Owww,  damn it!" he screeched, grasping his face. "Why can't people  just leave it alone?"</p><p>"Oh,  quit whining and sit down already," Nabiki drawled, gesturing to  the vacant seat next to her.</p><p>"Here?   Wouldn't you prefer a more private booth?" Hikaru asked, still  rubbing his nose as he glared at Ukyo.</p><p>"I  already agreed to share whatever it is you have to say with Ukyo,"  she explained, gesturing to the grinning chef. "I could just tell  her later, but if you insist on wasting my time like that there will  be a deduction to your fee."</p><p>"Fine,  whatever," he replied, taking a seat at the grill. "Can I get  two shrimp specials and a coke?"</p><p>"Coming  right up!" Ukyo replied and promptly poured two circles of batter  on the grill before her.</p><p>"So  what is it you have to tell me?" Nabiki asked, looking at her  watch.</p><p>"Before  I tell you anything, you have to agree to stop messing with my life,"  he replied with a guarded expression. "My parents weren't happy  at all with that faked letter from the school you sent home... how  could you tell them I was failing in writing composition? It's my  best subject!"</p><p>"Oh,  and I should just forget about the hell you put me through with that  dragon rose potion of yours?" the Tendo girl demanded.</p><p>"Yeah,  you should!" he spouted back. "It was an accident! Besides,  Ranma already got me back for that mess."</p><p>"Exactly  my point," Nabiki explained, "that was just Ranma's doing.   Regardless of what he did or didn't do, I haven't finished paying  you back just yet."</p><p>"If  you want to know what happened to Ranma after the school got trashed,  you have," he replied before digging into his meal with enthusiasm.</p><p>"So  that's the deal? I stop all my little pranks currently in progress  and you tell me what you want to know?" She summarized. "And  how do I know that what you have to tell is worth me just letting you  off the hook?"</p><p>"What  choice do you have?" the dark-eyed boy sneered.</p><p>Nabiki  paused as if considering the matter, but all that passed through her  mind was a derisive comment about him not being specific enough in  his deals and just what she would replace her current activities  with. "Well, for one I could have Ukyo here beat it out of you,"  she replied offhandedly. The young chef in question didn't seem to  be exactly jumping at the prospect, though. "...But I guess it  would be easier to just agree."</p><p>"Uh,  glad to hear it," he gulped, looking pointedly away from Ukyo.</p><p>"So  spill it already! Where's my Ranchan?" Ukyo demanded.</p><p>"Look,  let me start at the beginning, okay?" he nearly begged. When both  girls said nothing, he continued. "I'd been skipping school for  the last few days, trying to earn some quick cash by doing odd jobs  for the guys down at the open market. The antidote for that potion  is expensive, you know."</p><p>"Believe  me, I'm aware of that," Nabiki replied dryly.</p><p>Hikaru  continued, "Well anyway, I was running an errand for Jinsei's  fish stand when I saw it; a pillar of multicolored light centered  right over Furinkan that went so high I couldn't tell if it was  going up or being sent down from space. It was on my way, so I  figured I had to drop by and see what the hell was going on."</p><p>"By  the time I reached the school, though, the light show was over. It  was still pretty creepy, though, with the gym collapsing in on  itself. Then things got really quiet, and the air seemed to get  colder all of a sudden, like a misplaced winter breeze. I was too  stunned to do anything for a while, at least until I saw him."</p><p>"Ranchan?"   Ukyo asked, hopefully. "He wasn't hurt or anything?"</p><p>"Nope,"  the thin boy said, shaking his head. "Ranma was a bit dusty from  the debris but otherwise looked like he hadn't been touched. He  came climbing up out of the wreckage and immediately hurried over to  me, spouting orders for me to call for the ambulances and stuff."</p><p>"Why  didn't he do it himself, or help anyone else out of the crater?"  Nabiki asked, leaning forward with interest.</p><p>"I  asked just that very question, actually," Hikaru replied. "He  actually looked me right in the eye and told me he had more important  stuff to do."</p><p>"He  said what?" Ukyo whispered, looking down at her hands. "Ranchan  wouldn't say that. He wouldn't leave any of us like that, not  for anything."</p><p>"Well  apparently he would, because he did," Gosunkugi stated bluntly.  "Then he said he wouldn't be back until he was ready to get rid  of all his problems. I tried to ask him what he meant by that, but  he snapped at me and then ran off, mumbling something I couldn't  quite catch."</p><p>Nabiki's  blood went cold, recalling a rather painful conversation held in the  rain not too long ago. "You're positive that's what he said?  That exact phrasing?"</p><p>Hikaru  defended his information, stating, "I may not remember exactly what  he said, but that was the gist of it."</p><p>"What  sort of expression did he have when he said it?" Nabiki pressed.</p><p>Gosunkugi  thought for a moment, his eyes shifting up and to the left. "Uh,  kinda sad I guess, and a little angry. Why?"</p><p>Nabiki's  only reply was to close her eyes and sigh, "Ranma, you idiot."</p><p>"So  where is he now?" Ukyo asked, breaking the lull.</p><p>The  boy shrugged and replied, "No idea."</p><p>"What  do you mean 'no idea'? Didn't you see him leave?" Nabiki  snapped. "Where did he head off to, in what direction?"</p><p>"Last  I saw him, he was running up the middle of the street towards the  north end of town," He answered with a shrug. "I was a little  too busy looking for a phone to keep track of him, you know."</p><p>"North...  great, that sure narrows it down," Nabiki replied sarcastically.  She rose from her seat and turned towards the door. "If you'll  excuse me, I have quite a bit of work ahead of me."</p><p>"So  we're square now, right? No more mail-order tentacle rape movies  delivered postage due in my name for my mom to find?" Hikaru asked,  then looked around nervously at the other nearby customers.</p><p>Before  she could answer, Nabiki's awareness was suddenly jarred by the  sound of a wooden section of the front wall being destroyed. She  turned in time to see Mousse finish crashing to a halt, but not until  after destroying a booth and two tables with his entrance. The  fallen Amazon made no move to rise, but did grope at his throat with  his left hand, leaving bloody trails across his face and robes  momentarily before collapsing completely.</p><p>Ukyo's  reaction to the damage was to seize her combat spatula, vault over  the grill, and loudly scream "Jackass!" towards whoever was  behind the jagged hole.</p><p>Hikaru  took the opportunity to casually flee while he was still ahead,  unknowingly avoiding Nabiki's bill as well as his own.</p><p>"My  apologies," Kuno replied somberly as he peeked his head in the hole  cautiously, surveying the interior. "I shall of course see to it  that you are duly compensated for the damages."</p><p>"Wait...  you beat Mousse, Kuno? Who else is out there with you?" Nabiki  questioned, disbelieving. When he turned to look directly at her,  however, she paused to reconsider the injuries clearly visible on his  face: a rapidly swelling eye, a split lip, and a trail of blood  oozing slowly from his right nostril.</p><p>Tatewaki  snorted. "I choose to ignore that comment for now, Tendo Nabiki."   Turning to Ukyo, he asked, "May I leave this injured boy to your  care? His shoulder and elbow shall require relocation, and it  appears as if he may require stitches on his other arm though I am  not aware of any cause for such an injury."</p><p>"Don't  worry about him... I know how to handle stuff like this," Ukyo  explained, "and I'll have a repair estimate for you tomorrow,  Kuno."</p><p>He  nodded. "I shall expect it shortly then. Oh, and do restrain  yourself from using any cold water in cleaning his wounds; there  could be... complications... from such a treatment."</p><p>"Why  would you say that, Kuno baby?" Nabiki inquired, attempting to  guide a definitive statement out of him rather than simply inferring  his meaning.</p><p>Kuno  narrowed his eyes and glanced between the two girls. With a burst of  speed he reached into his belt, retrieved a translucent plastic  object, and activated it in the girl's directions one after the  other. All he said by way of explanation was, "Merely testing a  hypothesis."</p><p>"What  the hell was that for?" Ukyo demanded.</p><p>Nabiki  wiped the slightly cool water out of her eyes and stared blankly at  the young kendoist. She stood silent for a brief moment, pondering  the potential shift such a new development to the standard Nerima  social order would have on her business, but perhaps more curious as  to just how he managed to finally work out the existence of the  curses in the convoluted tangles of his mind. "Let me walk you  home, Tatewaki; I think we have much to discuss."</p><p>"If  you insist," Kuno replied evenly as he tucked the water pistol back  into a hidden pocket in his shirt.</p><p>The  middle Tendo massaged her forehead for a moment in frustration,  shared a curious glance with Ukyo, and followed the young man out the  door.</p><p>As  she crossed the threshold, however, something deep in her mind  screamed at her to stop. The Kuno situation was a pressing concern,  certainly, but another issue was more important; finding Ranma before  he does something drastic.</p><p>"Do  you not wish to accompany me?" Kuno demanded, looking tiredly over  his shoulder.</p><p>"No,  on second thought I'll talk with you another time, Kuno," she  replied, choosing to turn right instead of left, as Tatewaki had,  when she stepped out onto the sidewalk. At a quick pace she traveled  home, feeling far from happy but at the same time satisfied that she  was making the correct choice.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>He  stood at the water's edge, watching the slow ripples glide across  the deep blue glass-like surface to gently brush against the rocky  beach at his feet. Tracing back across their reversing paths he  noticed that they were spreading against the slight wind, moving  outward from a single location at the far edge of the lake where  large bubbles would rise from time to time.</p><p>"Tell  me again why we're here, Saotome?" Ryu asked from further up the  beach, annoyance mixed equally with curiosity. "I've got  training to do yet today, you know."</p><p>"I'm  not stopping you," Ranma replied coldly. "In fact, I recommend  you leave now, for your own safety."</p><p>"My  own... What, you think I can't look after myself just because you  beat me once?" Ryu demanded.</p><p>Ranma  turned his head to catch sight of him from the corner of his eye.  "No, but I'm about to challenge something very powerful and I  don't want to have to worry about not killing you while I'm  dealing with it. I don't want or need your help, either, so just  stay out of the way."</p><p>Ryu  looked a bit angry, but he hesitated to reply. "Fine, fight your  so-called eight-headed dragon on your own... And don't come back  to my campsite unless you bring your own food this time." He  turned to walk away, casually flipping Ranma the bird over his  shoulder as he made his way back up the trail, disappearing into the  undergrowth.</p><p>"Finally...  geez, I thought he'd never leave," Ranma complained as he stepped  towards the waterline. He reached down with one hand, cupping some  of the lake water and splashing himself.</p><p>She  suppressed the urge to cry out as an unfamiliar sensation of sharp  pain crackling like lighting through her body, choosing to bite her  lip instead. Cursing her luck, she added a mental note to talk to  Cologne when she got back about this painful new development to her  condition.</p><p>"Come  on you stupid overgrown snake... There's a young, pretty, and  virginal girl waiting here just for you, tee hee!" she called out  in what she honestly thought was a sexy tone.</p><p>The  water surface rippled slightly, though she was pretty sure it was  only the wind.</p><p>Growling  slightly, Ranma loosened the top of the black silken garb to reveal a  hefty bit of cleavage and stepped into the lake, up to her knees in  the cold, dark water. With a very forced smile she began to splash  herself with the water playfully. Ignoring the intense cold as best  she could, Ranma called out, "Oh Mr. Orochi... Won't you help me  wash my back? Pwetty Pweese?"</p><p>Her  efforts were met, after a short wait, by the slow surfacing of one of  its smaller heads, stopping just high enough so that its two closed  eyes were completely above the waterline. At a languishing pace the  eyes opened to stare at the scene before it with a mixture of  confusion and fatigue through the tangled mass of its  sporadically-furred snout.</p><p>"Um...  Hi! Can the rest of your friends come out and play too?" she  cooed, smiling widely as she struck a suggestive pose.</p><p>The  eyes looked her up and down quickly and then sniffed the air.  Abruptly after the sniff its eyes stopped wandering, instead  narrowing and focusing only on Ranma's face for a moment with an  accusatory glare before sinking back into the lake.</p><p>She  stood frozen for a moment with her eyes closed, her hands slowly  tightening into fists. "Alright you bastard," she growled as a  red glow began to form around her, "I tried to do this the easy way  first, but it looks like I'll have to beat it out of you."</p><p>The  red glow quickly concentrated into a pulsating orb around her balled  fist. When it seemed to be of an appropriate size, Ranma leapt  backwards to land on the beach and thrust her hand forward. The  basketball-sized globe rocketed forward at this command and quickly  disappeared beneath the surface of the lake at the point the single  head had risen, leaving only a slight reddish glow from beneath the  water. After a short pause Ranma unclenched her outstretched hand,  accompanied instantly by a massive explosive swelling of the lake's  surface and a deep resonating tone.</p><p>As  the deposed water fell back in a misty torrent to the lake's  surface the serpent's head appeared again, this time not stopping  at the waterline and accompanied by two others. The heads reared  back and released a deafening roar seemingly one part avalanche and  two parts jet airliner.</p><p>Ranma  removed her little fingers from her ears with a slight pop and  resumed a fighting stance, awaiting her opponent's first move. She  didn't have to wait long as all at once the three visible heads  darted forward and breathed gouts of flame in her direction. Fully  prepared for this tactic, Ranma almost casually sprang over the  plumes of incoming heat, flipping twice in a tight ball and uncurling  at the last moment to deliver a vicious heel kick to the middle  head's brow ridge.</p><p>The  head sagged with the blow, but then shook off the stunning effect of  the strike leaving Ranma momentarily without a perch. The two  previous heads circled in to snap at the falling girl and two more  emerged from the lake directly beneath her. The four active heads  surged forward to devour the falling girl, but were caught quite  unprepared for her to change her trajectory with a pair of expanding  orange blasts focused on the lower two toothy pits below her.</p><p>Ranma  landed lightly on the beach once more, but had to roll aside as heads  six and seven burst through the sand beneath her feet. Heads two and  three, the only others not yet affected by an attack, circled in on  Ranma's new position from the lake as the two newest entrants  coiled behind her, ready to respond to her attempts to dodge. Heads  one, four and five reared up as if to roar again, but no sound came  forth.</p><p>"Adapting  already I see," Ranma taunted as the serpent's combined assault  began to unfold, starting with an open-mouthed charge from two of the  lake heads at different heights and angles. Rather than dodging  away this time, the redhead blasted several narrow beams of chi from  her outstretched hands directly at the barren earth in the paths of  the two attackers and dashed forward between them under the cover of  falling debris. The two reserve attackers charged in, but unable to  clearly see could not avoid the martial artist's follow up attack,  consisting of a large and very dense ball of greenish blue energy.</p><p>"You'd  better keep working on that combo, though," Ranma smirked,  unfortunately leaving herself wide open for the sudden powerful blast  that struck her in the back with sufficient force to send her  tumbling end-over-end nearly twelve meters, completely knocking all  the air from her lungs.</p><p>Doing  her best to ignore the intense burning sensation in her back, the  girl looked back with wide eyes toward the lake. The most central of  the visible heads and the first to appear was either glaring or  smirking at her with slight wisps of golden energy trailing like  smoke from the corners of its mouth. Heads four and five reared back  with wide open toothy maws, both pointed directly at her and both  sporting a pulsing form of condensed golden light hovering between  their jaws.</p><p>Desperately  she scrambled away from her landing spot as twin lances of golden  death blazed forth, blowing large craters behind her and kicking up  copious amounts of rock and coarse sand into the air. In the  confusion she once again found her feet and breath, but immediately  was forced to roll aside as one of the serpents previously emerging  from the sand attempted to tear her head off. The other land-based  foe rumbled by soon after, managing to strike her a glancing but  powerful blow with the side of its head as it thundered past her.  She rolled with the impact as best she could, then ran at full speed  away from the cloud of settling debris, muttering angrily,  "moss-crusted bastard must have been playing dumb last time, not  taking me seriously."</p><p>Upon  exiting the cloud of debris she was immediately forced to duck and  roll as two more chi attacks from the direction of the lake streaked  toward her position. The twin blasts passed harmlessly overhead, but  the sudden odd sensation of loose strands falling against her cheeks  and the unmistakable scent of burnt hair told Ranma just how close  they must have been to scorching her face instead.</p><p>She  glanced up during this brief moment of rest to take stock of the  current situation. Of the five heads protruding from the waters only  the central one, the one she had kicked in the head, seemed to be  gathering energy for another blast of that intense burning chi; an  action that was mirrored by the two land-bound heads on each of her  flanks. Oddly enough the energy seemed to be coming not from the  dragon itself but from thin air around its open mouth... not good,  considering that might mean that a constant stream of blasts would  not tire it out any time soon. The two heads next closest to the  center, still sporting slight burn marks from her earlier assault,  were moving cautiously toward her position, sticking close to the  water line. The remaining two of the seven heads so far revealed  were pulling away from her position directly above the two advancing  heads, perhaps in preparation for yet another combination attack.</p><p>"What  now?" her mind whirled, trying to find a solution to the problem  set before her. "Damn dragon has me outnumbered, outmaneuvered and  probably outgunned, too. I'm way faster then any of 'em, but I  can't do nothin' with that because they keep each other covered.  But I bet they can't cover an attack that they don't know is  coming..." With a wry and confident sneer Ranma relaxed her  posture, allowing her battle aura to fade along with all traces of  her existence. Keeping her footsteps too light to leave prints in  the sand, she dashed forwards to meet the charge of two unsuspecting  heads.</p><p>Her  momentary invisibility was rendered useless, however, when the two  heads advancing near the waterline plowed into the beach rather than  at her previous position. The impact resulted in a wave of solid  debris across a wide swath of the beech that clearly parted on  contact with her. Immediately two crisscrossing bursts from the  flanking heads fired in her direction, forced her to tumble  backwards.</p><p>The  two sand throwers now cut off her retreat with jets of flame to  either side and behind her, leaving her with nowhere to dodge when  the central-most head let loose yet another of the golden light  attacks. She screamed, throwing forward the strongest blast of  yellow-orange chi she could muster to counter the attack but the  dragon's breath passed through the pressure wave unabated. At the  last possible second she pulled her arms tightly over her face and  upper chest, curling her head down behind the block and leaning  forward on bent knees as the burning wave crashed into her.</p><p>"Why  don't you fight back, Ranma? Don't you want to win?"</p><p>"Of  course I do, damnit!" She mentally snapped as the blast blew her  completely off her feet.</p><p>"Your  friends will all die if we fail, Ranma; some slowly and others quite  soon."</p><p>"I'm  doing all I can!" she cried. Her sleeves caught fire as the blast  carried her backwards through the twin plumes of naked flame.</p><p>"No  Ranma, you're not. You're still holding back, afraid to face  this beast with your full strength. Call out to the darkness and it  will set us free."</p><p>"No!"  she shouted, clenching her eyes shut against the pain as the golden  light began to burn her exposed skin. "Calling on that technique  is what got me into this mess in the first place. If I use it now  I'll lose control again and someone is going to die. I won't be  responsible for any more deaths!"</p><p>"What  about all the people who will die back home simply because you  wouldn't stand up for them? Your soul will be bathed in blood  today regardless of your choice, fool!"</p><p>"But  it won't be by my will!" she replied defiantly as her body  crashed into a rocky outcropping.</p><p>"If  you know the consequences of hesitation but do not act you have still  willfully chosen to follow that path. Not fighting back is as good  as killing your friends and loved ones with your own bare hands,  Ranma!"</p><p>"No,  there has to be another way. I just need more time to think," she  pleaded, collapsing in a smoldering heap against the crumbling rock.  "I just need more time..."</p><p>"The  time is now, Ranma! Kill or be killed; take life to preserve it!"</p><p>She  opened her eyes slightly and looked ahead, but only saw death looking  back. The central head was charging forward with its hungry jaws  spread wide in anticipation of a meal well earned, flanked on either  side by two more bursts of golden light that cut off her escape  routes. The other four heads were closing in from above on both  sides, their eager eyes betraying the desire to snap up any spare  crumbs her corpse left behind.</p><p>"Damn  you," Ranma thought bitterly, knowing that the voice was right.  Her aura flared with deep and angry red, shadowed at the edges. The  sudden movement of air put out the slight flames trailing up her  arms.</p><p>"Damn  you," Ranma scolded herself under her breath for the weakness and  overconfidence that made this sacrifice necessary. The shadows  deepened to solid pitch as they spread across her aura, twisting and  growing like thorny vines as she stood. A slight muscle spasm racked  her body, but he ignored the minor sensation.</p><p>"Damn  you," Ranma sneered at the oncoming serpent, staring it down with  cold, dead eyes and a cruel smile. The darkness flowed freely now,  around, inside, and through him, refreshing his depleted reserves of  will and strength. The slight tremor and brief sensation of sleeping  nerves faded into a profound feeling of power and health not unlike  what he often felt right after a good fight.</p><p>With  the utmost confidence Ranma raised one hand casually before him in a  loose fist, eagerly anticipating the first spray of hot blood across  his raw skin.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Ryu  trudged through the undergrowth with heavy, deliberate steps, each a  little harder and angrier than the one before. His mind was wracked  with conflicting sides of a debate, one certain that Saotome Ranma  was a complete jerk and the other just as certain that he was right  to think he would just be a burden. Both sides were convinced that  anger was the proper response to the problem, but had not, as of yet,  determined whether it should be best applied within or without. He  obeyed, though he continued to bitterly grumble as he made his way  back to camp.</p><p>The  debate was put on momentary suspension, however, when a thunderous  roar unlike anything Ryu had ever before perceived literally shook  the forest around him. Any doubts he had about the validity of  Ranma's claim of facing off with a 'dragon' were silenced by  the tremendous utterance, leaving him only with the desire to see  just what was really going on with his own eyes.</p><p>He  had only left the beach a few moments ago, so it took him only a few  moments to return to a truly impressive scene. He watched with  wonder, respect, and yes, even a touch of envy, as Ranma squared off  with seven bearded, serpentine heads, each larger than a full-sized  car. Obviously the younger fighter had improved in the time since  they had last fought, for she moved with a grace and ease amidst the  dangerous foes without losing her cocky smirk. Or at least she had,  until one of the heads opened its throat to roar but loosed a beam of  golden light rather than sound.</p><p>The  blast was a major turning point, suddenly putting Saotome off her  rhythm and forcing her on the defensive. He watched, paralyzed at  the sight, as Ranma frantically dodged and weaved through the  alternating golden blasts, gouts of flame, and bull rushes that the  serpents brought to bear in rapid succession and synchronization,  almost as if they were a single entity rather than individuals.</p><p>For  a brief moment, Ryu noted darkly that Ranma seemed to fade out of  existence as she had in their previous fight, a maneuver which should  have been permanently sealed away from use as per their wager. A  suspicion of the real reasons Ranma had tried to get him to leave the  fight began to fester in the back of his mind like a jagged shard of  glass, but still he did not interfere.</p><p>Under  the continued assault of the serpents Ranma soon fell prey to a  trapping pattern, pinned down by repeated blasts and a double gout of  flame until another of the deadly rays caught her full force in the  chest, her small frame thrown backwards into the cliff-face beneath  his vantage point with an impact that he could almost feel through  the stone. Ranma looked very small and weak in that instant,  sprawled limply in the rocky sand as two more blasts flanked her  position and the other heads charged in for the kill.</p><p>For  a moment the thought flashed across Ryu's mind that he could help,  perhaps draw the beasts' ire long enough for Ranma to escape.  These thoughts were stilled when the something in the wind shifted  imperceptibly, sending a chill down his spine. Below him Ranma began  to stand, shakily at first but soon with a defiant air as the  girl's... no, it was definitely a man's body now, was enveloped  by a mysterious wave of energy the color of polished coal.</p><p>"So  this is the technique he was so paranoid about last night," Ryu  commented to no one in particular. The foreign and bizarre sight  before him seemed to inspire a perhaps quite rational sense of terror  and simultaneously fill him with the extremely peculiar sensation of  slow warmth, not unlike coming home out of a storm.</p><p>Torn  between incongruous attraction and repulsion for this strange  technique, Ryu simply watched as one of the heads from the lake  charged at Ranma, its mouth held wide open, ready to swallow the boy  whole. Ranma stood defiantly with a single raised arm as if in a  warding gesture as the beast engulfed him, only to witness the  serpent fall to the ground around the black-clad young man in thick,  meaty strips. Thick streamers of the mutilated beast's blood broke  on Ranma's form like a wave crashing helplessly against the  unforgiving coast.</p><p>The  other four nearby heads bellowed with mindless rage and charged as  the black-shrouded warrior pulled his forward-thrust limb back. The  blackness collapsed in on itself, contracting like a viper poised to  strike, then expanded outwards to meet the charging foes as Ranma  threw his arms out wide, his movements trailing multiple shadowy  echoes. For a brief moment the air around Ranma seemed to bend and  distort like a dessert horizon, but then all that could be seen was  blood and pulpy flesh.</p><p>"What  the hell was that!" Kumon Ryu demanded, hiding in the shrubbery no  longer. As if in answer, Ranma retracted the now widely-spaced  fingers on the end of his outstretched arm and glanced upwards  directly at him, meeting his questioning glance with sharp eyes and a  wide, gleaming smile in stark contrast to his blood-splattered face.  Somehow it seemed the honest smile of a child who just mastered a new  trick, now seeking attention and approval from all witnesses.</p><p>In  that look Kumon saw the ashes of his life, the years of his childhood  wasted trying to master the very art that killed his father. The art  he had recently been sworn to abandon now revealed not only to be  unsealed but practiced unashamedly at a level that would have  required long hours of practice to achieve. The art that turned out  to be nothing but a lie his father had bought, that he had bought  into as well, and was only beginning now to free himself of the debt.   But now the joke went one step further, one more bitter taste of  bile; the techniques weren't the joke he had been told they were,  that he had all but renounced his father's memory over. If  anything, using the combined schools was apparently a force more  powerful and ruthless in nature than he had imagined possible.</p><p>Ranma's  gaze returned to the lake as yet another serpentine head appeared  from the water, this one easily four times as large as the others.  The two remaining smaller heads moved to flank the larger one and  fired more beams in Ranma's direction. They met no resistance save  the cliff-face as Ranma disappeared from view completely, only to  reappear directly before the larger head wile performing an inverted  heel kick. As the darkness of his aura came into contact with the  water's surface a large, solid blade of vacuum force formed,  sucking up the water in its wake. The water-scythe grew in size  until the attack met a solid resistance in the form of a wide golden  sheen less than a half-meter from the beast's exposed throat, then  dissipated.</p><p>The  mayhem that proceeded from this point for several minutes is  difficult to describe. The three heads released a near constant  barrage of golden beams from both the smaller heads' mouths and the  large one's eyes, intermixed with huge gouts of blue flame from the  main head that covered a third of the lake at a time. Ranma seemed  to fade in and out of view at different locations, leaping wildly  across the lake as though it were a reliable foothold but never  seeming to actually touch the water as he dodged between the  serpents' attacks.</p><p>This  protracted fight began to draw to a close as one of the smaller heads  suddenly burst into a shredded mass of blood-dripping gore, followed  very shortly thereafter by a similar treatment of the other. The  large head, the last remaining, roared with pain and malice in a tone  even more deafening then the last at this predicament. Ranma faded  into view hovering casually above the lake, positioned directly  before the great serpent with a contemptuous crossed-arm posture, his  aura swirling dangerously about him in a larger radius than it had  previously. The beast responded to the taunt with a sudden gout of  flame which Ranma apparently did not choose to dodge.</p><p>When  the flames abated Ranma remained floating in the same position, the  only visible change being that his aura of darkness seemed even  larger and darker than before, nearly six meters across. With a  relaxed air he drew his arms back, then snapped them forward to  release two vacuum blades in curving arcs toward the serpent. The  formerly-pigtailed boy then performed a backwards flip, creating yet  more blades with his feet on an intercepting path with the others.  The blades met in pairs as the golden sheen again appeared before the  beast, at first seeming to cancel each other out but then exploding  outwards in tightly rotating waves of destruction. The effect seemed  self-sustaining, and continued to tear at the shimmering barrier at  opposing sides and visibly weakening the effect in the area between  the attacks.</p><p>The  darkness of Ranma's aura coalesced during this time behind him in  two roughly wing-shaped masses, though still conforming to a  spherical boundary. Ranma threw his arms forward violently, and at  this command the wings separated into multiple thin darts, each  impacting the weakened area in quick succession, finally managing to  pierce the shell and continue through to lance into the surprised  monster's body. Neither combatant moved as the glittering barrier  collapsed nor as the rotating blades of distorted air faded away into  nothingness, allowing the blood-tinted water to fill in the furrows  in the lakes' surface. The serpent stared balefully at its  conqueror for a moment, but when it finally blinked Ranma threw his  arms wide again with fingers spread and the black impaling masses  followed suit, ripping out of the dragon's flesh at several  different angles. The severed lumps splashed heavily, one at a time  but at an increasing pace, into the red-tinged water below.</p><p>As  the much-lessened remains of his dark aura returned to its natural  place, the blood-soaked victor floated down to the still-floating  masses. He selected as a trophy of the kill a large section of the  snake's former scalp, apparently coated with some sort of fungal  growth that was notably absent on the smaller beasts. Ranma floated  back sluggishly to the beach, dragging the scalp behind him with one  hand, tightly gripping it by several grey-white hairs as he  occasionally dipped into the lake surface. Upon reaching the shore  Ranma staggered several steps up the beach, turned to look back up at  Ryu with a threatening smile. He then collapsed sideways in a heap  lying halfway in the bloodied waters, still tightly gripping his  gruesome trophy as the blackness surrounding him faded away.</p><p>Almost the second Ranma hit the sand a slightly younger man of a  slender but athletic build bearing more than a passing resemblance to  Saotome emerged from the foliage. The newcomer was wearing a white  bandana much like the one Ryu had recently lost, a loose black coat  over sturdy cotton clothing, and wielding a janitorial-style wooden  broom. The stranger knelt down to check the black-haired warrior's  vital signs and, apparently unhappy with what he found, spat on the  unconscious body. He then stood stiffly, glaring at the inert form  and holding his broom tightly as if undecided whether or not to  strike.</p><p>Ryu  had seen enough of this. Leaping down from the rocky cliff to land  awkwardly in the uneven and pliant sand below, resulting in planting  a hand in the still warm blood pool. Shaking the filth from his hand  as he regained his footing, Kumon shouted, "Back off, pal. If he  isn't dead then he's got to answer to me first."</p><p>"You!"  shouted the broom-wielding man in reply, "You should leave here  right away!"</p><p>Somehow  Ryu found himself unimpressed. "Want to try making me?" he  demanded, flexing his pectorals. His skills were a bit rusty, but if  Ranma wasn't standing by their pact then he didn't have to  anymore either.</p><p>"It  wasn't meant as a threat, just a warning," the man explained as  his posture relaxed. "I've left traps all around this area to  keep the animals contained."</p><p>Ryu  backed down slightly. "Fine, whatever... Look, we can make small  talk later, but right now we need to drag the sleeping psychopath  here out of the lake before he drowns on us."</p><p>"He?"  the young man puzzled for a moment, but quickly replied, "Agreed,  she has much to answer for. I am called Kushinada Shinosuke."</p><p>"Kumon  Ryu," he replied offhandedly as he approached. Up close it became  obvious that Ranma was indeed female again, but the stubbornly  raven-black and unevenly cut locks of hair seemed completely out of  place on this smaller body, somehow.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Ugh...  where the hell am I?" Mousse groaned, "and where is my robe?"</p><p>Ukyo  grudgingly pulled her head off of the countertop where it had been  resting so very comfortably (just for a moment, she told herself) to  look over to the booth on which the young man had been placed.  "H'llo there, sleepyhead," she sighed in what she hoped was  still un-slurred speech. "Had to take it off ya to patch you up."</p><p>"What?"  he asked, rolling over on his side to look at his host and quickly  discovering that putting weight on his right shoulder was a bad idea  at present. He unleashed a short burst of what she assumed were  Chinese curses under his breath as he rolled onto his back again and  sat up clad only in his thin black undershirt and ripped silk pants.</p><p>"Yeah,  that arm'll be sore for a few days, sugar. In the meantime why  don'tcha join me? It's good for the pain, if nothin' else,"  she asked in a somewhat somber tone as she handed over his  thick-framed glasses. In explanation she raised her small dish of  lukewarm sake in salute and drained it in a gulp, trying to enjoy the  slight burning sensation it left as it passed down her dry throat.</p><p>Mousse  rose stiffly from the makeshift cot and shuffled over to a barstool  at the counter next to her. She placed the small ceramic dish in her  hand in front of then retrieved two more from a stack next to the  small stainless-steel heater and filled each of them with a steaming,  clear liquid. "Three? Is someone else here as well?" the injured  young man asked.</p><p>"Nope;  just us, Mousse, but you've got some catchin' up to do," she  replied, propping her head up with one arm against the countertop and  looking at him with a tired gaze.</p><p>"I  will humbly share this alcohol with you, Ukyo," he replied  seriously, pausing to down the first dish with his bandaged but  functional left arm, "But only if you tell me why you're  drinking."</p><p>"'Cause  my fiancé is an uncarin' bastard, tha's why," she spat  bitterly.</p><p>"Granted,"  the amazon replied, finishing the third drink, "but what else is  new?"</p><p>Ukyo  glared at him, snatching the dish out of his hand to refill it. "I  get to complain 'bout Ranchan, but you don't... not in my house,  an'way."</p><p>"By  all means then, continue for the both of us," he answered. "I'm  sure tired of doing it, for all the good it does."</p><p>"Hmmph,"  she grunted in response. "I found out this afternoon that not only  has that jackass been worryin' me silly for the pas few days by  runnin' off again, but he act'lly knew I was hurt and didn't do  a damned thing to help. Top of that, he swore not to come back 'till  he's gotten rid of all his pro'lums... and way I heard it, I  think he 'cluded me in that list."</p><p>"Ah,  I suppose that is a good reason for drinking then," he sighed,  "good enough for the both of us." He then raised his dish in  salute and intoned sadly, "To love unjustly lost."</p><p>"I  'spected you to be happy, Mousse," she noted dejectedly. "One  less obstacle for you and Shampoo."</p><p>"If  only," he sighed. "That's why I was fighting that Kuno idiot  today; he somehow managed to get involved and the old mummy  recognized him as a legitimate contender for Shampoo's hand now."</p><p>"Cheer  up, Mousse. Kuno's so caught up on Akane and Ranchan that he won't  be much of a threat," she offered halfheartedly.</p><p>"That's  just it, he says he's given up on both of them for my Shampoo,"  he almost cried, "and ever since that mess with Saffron she hasn't  said one kind thing to me, not even the little friendly chatter we  used to have at the café."</p><p>"Maybe  you aren' being fair to yourself, Mousse, staying loyal to her for  so long," Ukyo stated bluntly. "If she doesn' 'preciate you  by now then maybe she isn' worth the wait. You deserve better."</p><p>"So  then you don't think Ranma is worth a damn either?" Mousse  snapped, looking away sharply.</p><p>"Hey,  I told ya not to say stuff about my Ranchan!" she yelled.</p><p>Mousse  turned back to face her glare with one of his own. "So my love  life is open game for dissection but I can't even point out that  you're being a hypocrite?"</p><p>"How'm  I being a hyp'crite!" she demanded.</p><p>"You  said that if my loyalty hasn't paid off by now then Shampoo isn't  worth the wait, never mind that you're drowning your troubles with  Ranma but apparently still clinging to this non-existent  relationship. It's the same damned thing!" He downed another  drink and slammed it on the counter for emphasis.</p><p>"It's  not the same at all!" she retorted. "We've known each other  since we were kids, and besides he's engaged to me! All you're  doing is hangin' around and annoying Shampoo!"</p><p>"Oh  really? I guess it never occurred to you that Shampoo and I grew up  together in the village? That we were close friends?" Mousse  snapped. "It's tradition in my village that the strongest  warrior in each generation marries the fittest male. If Ranma hadn't  blundered along Shampoo and I would be together by now! But of  course that couldn't happen, the stupid outdated village laws had  to screw up my life once again."</p><p>"But  Ranchan would have married me by now if it weren't for all the  other girls!" she complained.</p><p>Mousse  just looked at her.</p><p>"Oh,  right," she sighed, apologetically. "That's your problem,  too." Ukyo attempted to pour herself another drink but succeeded  only in spilling the remaining sake across the counter.</p><p>"I  think you've had enough," Mousse commented.</p><p>Ukyo  folded her arms across the bar and laid her head down tiredly.  "Maybe your' right, Mousse. Maybe 'nough is 'nough."</p><p>"Well,  for you at least," he sighed as he lightly swirled the last  remaining dish of liquor. "I could have used some more yet, I  think."</p><p>"No,  I mean 'nough with one-way love," she explained, turning her head  to face him but not raising it.</p><p>He  set the dish down on the counter and let his head droop. "I think  I already gave up on Shampoo a few days ago, actually."</p><p>"What  'bout the fight in the gym, or today then?" she asked.</p><p>"Just  kidding myself, really," he explained with a slight bitter chuckle.  "I think I was more upset that those two jerks lucked into  something I couldn't manage to earn than actually trying to win her  love... just fighting for my wounded pride, I guess."</p><p>"Lucky  you, then," Ukyo sighed. "I still love my Ranchan, even though I  shouln'."</p><p>"You'll  get over him eventually, I'm sure," he replied, downing the last  drink with a sad smile. "You'll meet someone who has a much  better appreciation of the loyalty and warmth you have to offer,  Ukyo."</p><p>She  paused in the conversation and for the first time in the evening  stopped to really look at the young man before her. He didn't have  Ranma's rugged good looks or cocksure grin, but rather a more  cultured kind of handsomeness and a greater appreciation for common  politeness. His shoulders weren't quite as broad but he stood  several inches taller, and his muscles were, as she'd learned while  bandaging him, just as toned beneath his clothing as Ranma's.</p><p>She  squinted against the slight blurriness to take note the details of  his face, usually so strong and proud but at this moment softened  with hopelessness and loss, weighed down with bitter regrets. In a  way he reminded her of the way Ranma would look every time he came to  her restaurant and sat in this exact same spot needing someone to  share his troubles with, a young man nearly crushed to death under  the weight of his responsibilities. In short, Mousse looked  hopeless, vulnerable and in desperate need of comfort; the same way  she assumed she would look to herself right now.</p><p>Gathering  her courage, she managed to break the silence by blurting, "Someone  like you?"</p><p>"'Uh?"  Mousse replied without looking up. She noted that his voice was just  a bit slurred now as well.</p><p>"Ya  said I should find someone who can 'preciate my loyalty and  warmth," she explained, scooting closer to him on her stool. "Who  better n' somebody who has the same problem?"</p><p>Mousse  looked up at her, looking directly into her eyes but not backing  away. "Are you sayin' what I think you are?" he asked  seriously.</p><p>In  answer she scooted off of her barstool to stand uneasily, maintaining  a firm hood on the counter for support. With her free hand she  gently brushed the long, sleek hair that hung in front of his cheek  to its ends, reversed direction to follow the contours of his jaw  line up to his glasses, and lightly removed them from his face.</p><p>Mousse  opened his mouth to say something, but Ukyo would tolerate no more  words. She leaned in quickly, dropping his glasses carelessly so  that she could cup his face while she stole a kiss. In the process  of moving in, however, she lost her grip on the countertop and  tumbled into him heavily, dislodging the surprised young man from his  seat to fall in a tangled heap of drunken limbs with her on the  restaurant floor.</p><p><b>Author's  notes:</b></p><p>First  off, if you're reading this 'Ghost', could you send me an  e-mail directly? I tried to reply to your rather helpful reviews but  my messages keep getting bounced back for some reason.</p><p>Secondly...  yeah, I know this took forever to come out. I've got a life  outside of fanfiction that keeps me pretty busy, and on my free time  I'd often rather have a few drinks with friends and watch football  than write. I said that I'll finish this story and I meant it, but  I won't give any specific deadline for completion. To those of you  who have inquired about the story's status, please understand that  I do appreciate that you enjoy my work so don't take this as some  sort of insult. However, I am not at all sorry that this story has  been 'delayed' for so long... that's just the way things are  going to be for this fic.</p><p>The  hold Kuno used on Mousse is a slightly modified form of the move  known as "Kataha Jime" or "Single-Wing Choke," a traditional  subdual grip practiced in judo.</p><p>To  the best of my knowledge, Shinosuke's family name isn't given in  the manga. The name Kushinada is taken from the young woman who was  to be the Orochi's sacrifice in the original Japanese myth, so it  seemed appropriate. If anyone can offer me a reliable source for an  official name, though, I'll be happy to change it.</p><p>And  yes, I am fully aware that some of the material in this chapter could  be considered 'cheesy'. Rest assured that nothing will be  developing in nice, clean lines despite any present appearances.</p><p>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #2</p><p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered!
