</div><p><b>Into  Every Life, a Little Rain Must Fall<br/></b>A  Ranma 1/2 (manga) fanfic by NemesisZero</p><p><b>Act  3: Shuffling the Deck of Fate<br/></b>Part  3</p><p><b>"Insider"  Pre-readers:</b><br/>Freak247</p><p><b>"Outsider"  Pre-readers:</b><br/>Aondehafka<br/>Edward<br/>Sterling  Ag</p><p><b>Recap  of Last Chapter:</b></p><p>Ryoga  attempted to teach Akane the basics of a chi attack, but for reasons  unknown to him the attack exploded in his hands, injuring him badly.  Soun, Akane, and Kasumi went along with the boy to the hospital where  the staff struggled to make sense of the incident. Genma,  meanwhile, was informed of Happosai's death due to 'natural  causes'.</p><p>Across  town, Kuno had a confrontation with his second, Toji, which ended in  the captain choosing to resign his membership in the kendo club.  Almost immediately after this incident Mousse attacked him, ending  very badly for Mousse and disturbing a meeting between Nabiki,  Hikaru, and Ukyo on the subject of Ranma's disappearance. Ukyo  tended to the injured Mousse and (after consuming large amounts of  alcohol) came on to him quite strongly.</p><p>Meanwhile  outside the borders of Nerima, Ranma at last confronted the Orochi  with the intention of securing a cure for the situation back home.  The serpent caught him off guard with a powerful previously  unrevealed ability and nearly defeated Ranma, but this battle was  transformed into a wholesale slaughter when Ranma willingly gave into  the temptation to use his new abilities. Onlookers Ryu and  Shinnonoske witnessed the destruction and gleeful savagery that Ranma  unleashed in a manner that seemed to be a further refinement of the  sealed Saotome secret arts, Yamasenken and Umisenken.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Drifting  on the hair's-breadth line between dream and wakefulness, Ukyo  sighed happily. Above and beyond any other slight traces of emotion  and sensation, she felt protected, warm, and loved. In the real  world she clutched possessively to her thick warm blankets against  the cool night air, but her dreams were quite a different story. In  then she was pressed flesh to flesh against Ranma's iron hard  chest, greedily draining every ounce of heat her human furnace could  produce while he slept unaware, shifting slightly with each deep,  bellows-like breath.</p><p>Truth  be told this was one of the tamer dreams she'd had concerning the  young man, but in a very simple way this feeling of natural  togetherness and intimacy far overpowered even the wildest of her  previous fantasies. The dream held an eerily realistic quality, for  instance the subtle sensation of her lover's toes lightly brushing  against her ankle. It all made her wonder just how much better such  simple sensations would be when her wish finally came true.</p><p>Reality,  however, continued to pester the young chef, refusing to allow her to  return completely to the comfortable stillness of the dream. She  still had three cracked ribs after all, and no matter how comfortable  the position should have been her injured side was rather tired of  supporting her weight. Ruefully she acquiesced to the demands of her  body, rolling over and pressing her naked back and hips against the  young man, settling for his relaxed bicep as a pillow in lieu of his  chest.</p><p>She  was quite pleased when he reacted to the change almost automatically,  shifting slightly on his side and slipping his free arm around her.  The calloused hand brushed lightly across the tender skin of her  stomach to rest finally with his index finger nestled into the  crevice beneath her left breast, almost as if seeking out her  familiar heartbeat. She snuggled into his light embrace as he kissed  her neck, his long, soft locks of hair tickling her skin with the  movement. Huskily he whispered, "Wo ai ni."</p><p>It  took almost a minute for Ukyo's sleepy mind to snap to full alert.  All at once she went rigid with a full body muscle twitch. Her eyes  sprang open, then immediately clamped down against the sudden  appearance of the golden orange sunrise. She rubbed roughly at her  complaining sockets, groaning out loud all the while.</p><p>"Go  back to sleep," a male voice from behind her almost begged,  snuggling against her shoulder.</p><p>With  slight trepidation she opened her eyes just a crack, remembering to  shield them with her hand from the sun's direct assault. A wave of  jet-black hair entered her vision as it shifted in time to the slight  prodding of her bedfellow's chin into the crook of her neck.  Stretching out her other senses she noted the strong lingering taste  of sake on her teeth, a musky scent permeating the room, a deeply  resonating tone of drawing breath, and a faintly wet, clammy spot  beneath her hips on the mattress.</p><p>"Damn  it," she grumbled bitterly. "Now what the fuck am I gonna do?"</p><p>Her  partner let out a contented sigh and suggested, "Wait a few more  hours... too tired."</p><p>"Wake  up, Mousse," Ukyo commanded.</p><p>"Why?"  he inquired. "What time is it?" His warm hand left her chest to  rub the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>"Just  get up Mousse. You have to leave before anyone finds out about  this," she explained, slipping out of his grasp to make a hasty  trip to the bathroom, modesty be damned. As she stood and  immediately had to grab the bedpost for support as her well-earned  hangover made itself known with a heavy throbbing ache behind her  eyes. "Damn, how much did I drink last night?"</p><p>"No  idea. You were blitzed before I even started drinking, and tried to  keep up with me even then," he replied while stretching, then  stifled a yawn. "Besides, so what if someone knows?"</p><p>"What  do you mean 'so what'?" she said a little too loudly,  immediately regretting it. "I'm engaged you idiot, and last I  checked you were chasing Shampoo, not me!" she called from the next  room.</p><p>He  groaned in pain, apparently faring no better against the demon beast  alcohol, before replying, "But that's all in the past now, Ukyo.  Amazon law says..."</p><p>"No.   Hell no," She cut him off, "Don't start with me on the '3000  years of history' speech, just get out here and forget this ever  happened."</p><p>"But..."  he began as the rush of water in a western-style toilet marked the  end of her diversion. Moments later she came back into the room  wearing a comfortable old cotton sweatsuit.</p><p>"Look  Sugar, it was a mistake, all right?" Ukyo sighed. She began  gathering his discarded clothing from various locations about the  room. "A simple mistake we both made in an awkward moment; happens  all the time to normal people everywhere. All you have to do is get  out of here before someone randomly drops by and keep your big dumb  mouth shut! If you can do that we won't have anything, not even  outdated laws from backwater cultures, to bother us. Our secret, you  understand?"</p><p>"Um...  no?" Mousse offered meekly, sitting up with some effort to reveal  his hairless bare chest and bandaged shoulder.</p><p>Ukyo  growled in frustration and dropped the tangled bundle of clothing on  him. "Well then don't worry about understanding it but do it  anyway, damn it!"</p><p>"Can't  we talk about this?" he asked, looking through the pile of cloth.  "And where are my robe and glasses?"</p><p>"Downstairs  I guess," she replied offhandedly as she finally covered her  nakedness with a bathrobe. "There's nothing to talk about. The  sooner we forget this ever happened the smoother things will go for  both of us."</p><p>"But  we're married now, and that changes everything!" he protested.</p><p>"That's  it, Sugar," she growled, dragging the confused man out of bed  despite his protests. "I told you I don't want to hear any of  that crazy shit." She ignored his complaints of injury and  nakedness, marching resolutely downstairs to the restaurant's front  door where she released him on the street. His clothing ended in at  a pile at his bare feet.</p><p>Ukyo  prepared to go back in and find his other remaining possessions, but  stopped mid-stride as a sudden chill ran up her spine. Hugging  herself against the cold, she looked down and noticed she stood  completely engulfed in shadow, its edges stretching off much further  down the street. Her eyes followed the shade as it ran parallel to  other dark silhouettes, though it seemed to stretch much further then  the rest. The darkened streaks ending at the feet of four figures,  all dressed in black, who stood silently observing the scene.</p><p>The  first was a tall, muscular young man in a sleeveless shirt,  camouflaged pants, and a pair of military boots. On the other side  of the group was a bald old man, slightly bent with a cough. Next to  him stood a younger man with a staff of some sort in his hand and  wearing a baggy coat that made him look unhealthily thin.</p><p>The  last however, whose shadow still lingered over her, was altogether  different from his companions. Though slightly shorter than the  other young men and only carrying a satchel, he possessed a manner  that seemed far more threatening. His clothing, a black gi with the  top untied that presented a stark contrast against his bare chest,  was barely more than a loose collection of torn rags blowing in the  breeze. His hair was equally unkempt, a tangle of uneven, matted  black tufts. His eyes were masked by unfathomable shadows, but  somehow she knew they were locked onto her, coldly observing her  every expression. Another breeze ruffled her robe, and Ukyo caught a  scent of blood on the wind.</p><p>The  tattered young man turned to the militant one and gestured towards a  side street. The thin one seemed ready to protest, but the older man  calmed him and urged him to follow the camouflaged man's lead down  another street. Not bothering to watch their departure, the  remaining black-clad figure began to walk toward the store at an  even, controlled pace.</p><p>Instinctively  Ukyo reached behind her head for her combat spatula, but grasping  only air caused her to growl at her own unprepared state. She  hesitated as the man continued to approach, unsure whether she should  stand her ground or make a break for her combat tools.</p><p>Mousse,  now wearing his silk pants, stepped in front of her and took up a  defensive stance that kept his injured arm back. "Stay back... or  I doubt you'll find our hospitality to your liking."</p><p>The  figure stopped for a moment, his cold eyes shifting from Ukyo to  Mousse in apparent puzzlement. With a shrug he continued walking  forward. The Amazon struck out against his approach, but the blow  was easily intercepted with a firm grasp on his outstretched wrist.  "I don't have time for melodrama today, Mousse," the young man  replied as he casually shoved the injured would-be protector aside  and off his feet.</p><p>As  the man approached her Ukyo's instincts told her to run... and yet  she didn't. The voice that coldly dismissed her accidental lover's  attempted defense struck a cord in her psyche as well, creating the  mental equivalent of a double exposure where the disheveled figure  was concerned: one sporting a cocksure grin and eyes alive with every  challenge life could offer, the other a dead-eyed stare and a sneer  of displeasure towards prey that failed to adequately amuse before  expiring. As the man stepped into her reach she held her breath and  risked brushing his bangs out the way to peak at his face. A  familiar pair of grey-blue irises met her gaze.</p><p>"Ranchan?"  Ukyo squeaked, her suspicions confirmed but not at all sure if his  return at this moment was a good or bad thing.</p><p>"You  were expecting someone else?" he replied gruffly. His eyes seemed  sunken from lack of sleep, his gaze unflinching.</p><p>"Um,  not exactly," she answered, diverting her glance and fidgeting with  the hem of her shirt. "You've been gone for a while now and we  had no idea when you were coming back... or if you were coming back.  Besides, you don't exactly look yourself, Ranma." She glanced  down and noticed a faint red stain on her hands and belt. "What  happened to you?"</p><p>"It's  not really important right now... just suffice it to say that most of  the blood spilled wasn't mine," he assured her, rubbing more of  the semi-congealed residue from his bangs. "Dang, thought I got  rid of all of it... Anyway, what's the deal with Mousse?"</p><p>"Er,"  she began, wringing her hands as she spoke, "he was just kinda  staying at the restaurant so I could take care of his, um, wounds.  Kuno beat him pretty bad and left him unconscious on my floor, so it  sorta became my problem."</p><p>"Kuno  beat you, eh?" Ranma commented bluntly to the rising heap of  Amazon. "The jerk's apparently on a streak. Still, that doesn't  exactly explain you getting dragged outside naked, though, does it?"</p><p>"He,  ah... was sleepwalking! He mistook for me Shampoo and grabbed me in  my sleep!" Ukyo tried to salvage an excuse without outright  lying... merely distorting the truth and leaving out most of the  detail.</p><p>"He  was just lucky! If my hidden weapons techniques hadn't failed me  for some reason I'd have killed the fool!" Mouse complained at  the same time, then turned to her and rebuked, "What? What are you  saying?"</p><p>"Yeah...  I thought that might happen. That's sorta why I took off," Ranma  explained, looking at Mousse. He thrust a hand into the satchel he  carried and producing an unidentifiable lump of greenish-brown...  stuff... as he pointedly ignored the argument brewing in front of  him. "After the fight at the gym I noticed that everybody's chi  wasn't flowing correctly. For the normal students the problem will  probably go away on its own in a couple a' weeks. For those who  actually use their chi, though, I figure it might have gotten worse  each time ya tried... maybe even become harmful."</p><p>"And  you know this how?" Ukyo inquired as she elbowed the Amazon in the  ribs to shut him up.</p><p>"As  often as I used to end up at Doc Tofu's place, I kinda picked up  some knowledge on chi flows. Well, that and I'm pretty sure it was  because of me," he replied somewhat evasively.</p><p>"So  it was your fault!" Mousse angrily echoed.</p><p>"Yeah,  and that's why I'm fixing it," he snapped, plopping the handful  of gunk in Ukyo's hand. "If ya burn this moss as incense while  ya meditate, your chi pathways should be restored. Rub whatever's  left on those ribs, too."</p><p>"You  want me to breathe this junk?" Ukyo asked skeptically, a little  surprised he already noticed her injury.</p><p>"Yeah,  both of ya and Konatsu too if he was at the fight... I kinda lost  track of everyone involved. Then," he paused to drop another  handful in Mousse's palm, "I want you to make sure Shampoo and  the old bat get a serving too. Actually, reverse that; I bet Cologne  needs it more than either of you right now."</p><p>"The  Elder has been in very poor health of late," Mousse revealed, "but  I'm not exactly welcome there at the moment."</p><p>"Well,  tough. Both of ya go then; I've got other people to deal with at  the moment," he dismissed them, turning to leave. "You might  wanna get dressed though first."</p><p>"I  told you it was nothing, Ranchan... just a misunderstanding!" Ukyo  pleaded.</p><p>"...  and do something 'bout the sake still on your breath," Ranma  called back without turning.</p><p>Ukyo  watched him walk away in silence for a moment before turning and  grabbing Mousse by the throat. "I told you to shut up! God, why  are all Amazons so stupid!"</p><p>"Why  are all Japanese so loathe to accept the natural consequences of  their actions?" he retorted. "By Amazon law we are now married,  as he has been to Shampoo for over two years now."</p><p>"Do  I look like an Amazon to you? Your laws don't mean jack here, pal.   Just accept that it was a stupid, one-time, meaningless thing,"  Ukyo snapped as she walked towards the restaurant door. "I already  kicked you out for mentioning it so I suggest you drag your sorry ass  back to the Cat Café, do as Ranma said, and go back to working  on Shampoo."</p><p>"No!   There is no way in hell I'm losing two women to a degenerate  asshole like Saotome," he shouted at her back, "especially when  he doesn't even seem to want either of them!"</p><p>Ukyo  stopped abruptly, her hands balled into fists and shaking almost  uncontrollably with rage. She spun on her heel, marched up the  defiant young man, and slapped him hard enough to stagger him. As  the stunned Chinese boy stumbled for his footing she furiously  marched back to the restaurant and slammed the door behind her. She  stood for a moment with her back against the door staring into the  dark, empty room before her, then slid down the surface and began to  cry as Mousse pounded fruitlessly on the door.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>The  solitary walk across town in the quiet morning streets seemed to take  much longer than he expected. Perhaps it was because he was neither  running nor balanced on the fence top. Then again maybe it was just  because he was lost in conflicting thoughts of jealousy, betrayal,  sympathy, and hope. As the dojo gates came into sight, however, he  forced these thoughts aside; he was on a mission now.</p><p>The  large wooden doors opened easily but with a groan as he passed into  the short cobblestone path leading to the main gate. He glanced  aside as he walked, noting the carefully trimmed roes of shrubbery  that lined the walkway intermixed with a few recently uprooted spots  of bare soil. The yard beyond was evenly cut and smoothly shaped,  save an array of scorched craters and upturned cones of raw earth.  Ranma sighed, observing this almost divinely composed balance of  order and destruction. Home sweet ruin.</p><p>Recovering  his sense of purpose, Ranma resolutely stepped up to the front door  of the Tendo home. It was still very early to be calling but he  proceeded in anyway, knowing that at least one member of the  household would most likely be awake. With some slight annoyance,  however, he remembered the rather unfriendly terms on which he had  parted with that particular Tendo. Rather than knock, he decided the  best course of action would be to deal directly with the only one he  actually intended to speak with now. The rest could wait until  evening.</p><p>He  backed up a step before leaping to the sloping foothold of the lower  roof and following it quietly around to the rear of the home. He  crept past the first two windows, learning that his father was not  present and confirming that Kasumi was already awake, before reaching  his destination. Lightly he tapped on the glass but the girl slept  soundly behind a venetian blind. Rather than risk revelation so soon  (and in such a potentially damning situation) by knocking harder, he  chose the more direct method and carefully raised the windowpane.</p><p>The  window proved fortunately unlocked, gliding smoothly and silently  open. With practiced stealth he drew back the more troublesome  blinds, pausing momentarily as the breeze picked up and his target  shifted slightly in her sleep, her hand haphazardly stretching  underneath her pillow. He froze, worried that perhaps she had  awoken... but her slow, deep breathing and calm aura reassured him.  Carefully he eased the blinds the rest of the way up and stepped  through the window onto her desk. The wood was sturdy and held his  weight silently as he continued his languid movements until he was at  last safely on the floor.</p><p>With  measured steps he traversed the distance to her bedside and stood  above her vulnerable, lithe form. For a moment he stood transfixed  at the sight of her sleeping form; so peaceful and unguarded in  expression. Her face offered a pale contrast to her dark, silky  hair, not unlike seeing the moon bight in the night sky. He soon  pulled himself away from this vision, however, and reached forward to  gently shake her awake.</p><p>He  was quite unprepared when her hand sprang from beneath the pillow  holding a canister of some sort. He watched blankly as it swung in  front of his eyes, spraying a fine mist. "Ghhhhrrrraaa!" he  complained between clenched teeth as his pupils seared in chemically  induced pain, rubbing blindly at his sockets in a vain attempt to  remove the irritant. He was equally surprised when he received a  sharp blow to the testicles a moment later, followed by a stomp on  his foot and a kinfehand blow to his temple.</p><p>"What,  you thought just cause I don't run around town shouting 'I'm a  martial artist' on a daily basis that I'm defenseless?" the  blurred vision of loveliness jeered. From the noise of shuffling  desk drawers he guessed she was grabbing something heavy to clobber  him with further. Was this behavior a family trait?</p><p>"I  guess I shoulda just risked talking to Kasumi or Akane first,"  Ranma replied as he divided his attention between guarding his crotch  from further abuse and rubbing at his eyes. "At least with them I  woulda been expecting something."</p><p>"Kasumi?   What do you..." she trailed off, continuing with a soft tone,  "Ranma?"</p><p>"Who  else do ya know that climbs in through... oh never mind," he  answered, annoyed. "Nice ta see you too, Nabiki."</p><p>"Is  it really you?" she asked, moving closer cautiously.</p><p>"Geez,  does everybody around here only recognize me 'cause of the  pigtail?" he responded, finally getting one eye cracked open.  "Stupid dragon…"</p><p>Rather  than the expected (and well deserved, he thought) apology he wanted,  he found himself on the receiving end of a rather hard kiss. Amid  the sensations of a flickering tongue in his mouth and soft, warm  flesh pressed against him invitingly, he decided it would have been a  pretty good experience if not for the distracting ache in his groin  and searing pain still affecting one eye.</p><p>"I  owed you that," she whispered as the kiss ended. Images of a  similar situation on the school rooftop bounced around his semi-lucid  mind.</p><p>A  hard smack across the jaw brought him out of that fairly quickly. "I  owed you that too, you jerk! Where the hell have you been?"</p><p>"Can  I at least wash this out before ya hit me again?" he snapped.</p><p>"I...  yeah, but make it quick. I want answers to all the questions that  your absence has raised and I don't plan on waiting for them,"  she replied forcefully.</p><p>"And  keep it down, will ya?" he asked as he fumbled towards the door.  "I'm not ready to deal with everyone else yet. I came to you  first because I need your help."</p><p>"Help  with what?" she asked.</p><p>He  ignored her question for the moment and quickly headed towards the  small upstairs bathroom. The squeak of a door opening further down  the hall motivated a burst of speed around the corner.</p><p>"Nabiki?"  his official fiancée asked drowsily from somewhere down the  hall behind him.</p><p>"Hey  sis, what's up?"</p><p>"I  thought I heard voices in here and wanted to check it out. I thought  maybe a thief was trying to break in."</p><p>"No,  I just stubbed my toe on something when I got up to go to the  bathroom. Guess I need to remember to clean up tomorrow, eh?"</p><p>"Geez,  it's freezing in here. Why is your window open?"</p><p>"Er..."</p><p>"You  weren't sneaking some of Dad's cigarettes again, were you?"</p><p>"You  won't tell Kasumi will you?" she rolled with the conveniently  supplied alibi. "Last time I got caught my bentos were half-cooked  for weeks. I had to blow all of my spending money just to get a  decent lunch every day."</p><p>"Why  shouldn't I tell?"</p><p>"If  you do I'll double the interest on your... crap, you paid off your  last debt last week, didn't you?"</p><p>"Uh-huh.   Oh forget it, I won't tell. Just promise me you'll try to quit,  alright? One smoker in the family is bad enough."</p><p>"Thanks  sis... It's just been one of those weeks, you know? This is the  first time in forever, I swear."</p><p>"Just  make sure you put the pack back before Dad notices and throws a fit."</p><p>"If  he does I'll just blame it on Mr. Saotome."</p><p>"Nabiki,  he doesn't smoke!"</p><p>"So?   When has not needing something ever stopped him from taking it if he  thought he could get away with it?"</p><p>"You're  impossible!"</p><p>"No,  I'm tired. Get out of here already and let me get back to sleep."</p><p>"Fine,  see if I come to your rescue again..."</p><p>Ranma  listened as the youngest Tendo walked back down the hall and closed  her door before he dared to try for the bathroom again. He turned  the cold water faucet just a trickle and quickly rinsed out what  remained of the eye irritant, then made his way quietly back to  Nabiki's room.</p><p>He  found her curled up back under her covers with just one eye open,  glaring at him. She motioned quickly with one finger for him to be  quiet and to come over to her. As he approached she handed him a pen  and pad of paper with a single line written on it.</p><p>YOU  OWE ME, SAOTOME.</p><p>He  took the pen back and went to work on a reply.</p><p>WaT  elsE iS nEW? SenCE Wen DO YU SmoAKe?</p><p>She  glared at the pad silently for a moment before snatching the pen  back.</p><p>YOUR  HANDWRITTING IS HORRIBLE! CAN YOU GET US SOMEPLACE WE CAN TALK  WITHOUT LITTLE MISS NOSEY HEARING US?</p><p>With  a slight smile he picked her up and invoked the silent thief  technique, waiting patiently for Nabiki to remember her part:  focusing on being calm. When the disturbances in the aura subsided  he made his way through the door and down the stairs towards the  relative privacy of the wooded section of the back yard, next to the  storage shed.</p><p>They  passed undetected through the home until they neared the kitchen  where Kasumi was preparing breakfast. As Ranma's foot first  crossed the line of the doorway Kasumi froze and turned her  attentions on the door. He followed suit, remaining completely still  under this unexpected scrutiny. Kasumi relaxed her hold on the pan,  allowing it to clatter to the stovetop.</p><p>"Evil  spirits be gone..." she whispered fearfully at the unseen pair.</p><p>Taking  the cue, Ranma dashed down the hall then out into the back yard,  leaving the older girl clutching fearfully at the small golden cross  at her neck.</p><p>"How  in the hell did she notice us? Didn't you concentrate like I told  you?" he complained as he set Nabiki down behind the small utility  shed, next to the bare earthen plot that used to be the dojo.</p><p>"I  did my best! Oh, who cares anyway, we got away with it," Nabiki  replied defensively.</p><p>"It  matters because it means I'm getting rustier then I thought, and  that's a problem 'cause I might need it ta get some kind of  control of this damned new ability," he explained.</p><p>"That's  what happened at the school then?" she asked seriously. "You  tried to use it and lost control?"</p><p>"I  don't know for sure," he answered "but most likely, yeah. All I  remember is having another of those screwed-up dreams again and then  waking up in a pile of rubble. Not like last time..."</p><p>"You  used it again since then!" she complained loudly.</p><p>It  was his turn to reply defensively. "I didn't have a whole lot of  choice at the time, and I really don't wanna talk about this right  now, either. Let it drop."</p><p>"…But  you'll talk to me when you're ready, right?" she probed  further.</p><p>"Fine,  whatever," He agreed. "Look, I've got more urgent stuff ta  talk to you about anyway. I need you to find out the names of  everyone who was at the fight and ta help me distribute the cure."</p><p>"Cure?"</p><p>"Yeah,  what I went to collect. Didn't Gosunkugi tell ya?" Ranma  puzzled.</p><p>"Apparently  not correctly, he didn't..." she replied with a cruel grin. "It  looks like your copy of 'Backdoor Bondage Boys 3' will be  arriving soon, Hikaru."</p><p>"What?"  Ranma puzzled, looking a little ill.</p><p>"Oh,  nothing you need to worry about," she dismissed his question. "You  were saying something about needing a cure..."</p><p>"Yeah,  whatever happened really messed up the chi flows of everyone in the  building," the martial artist mused. "I've gotta make sure  everybody gets a portion of this before it gets dangerous."</p><p>Nabiki  stiffened, then put her hand comfortingly on his shoulder. "Ranma,  it already has. Ryoga had some sort of accident the other day while  training with Akane, Cologne is in a coma, and Happosai... died late  last night. I'm sorry."</p><p>He  sat in silence for a moment, letting the truth sink in before  slamming his fist into the ground in frustration. "I'm so  stupid! If I'd just thought ta take the train the first time  instead of running off on foot like a moron they'd be fine now!"</p><p>"It  isn't your fault!" Nabiki tried to comfort him. "Even if  something you did caused all of this, you didn't mean for any of it  to happen. It's tragic, but it was just a random accident."</p><p>"No,"  he replied resolutely. "I'm responsible for all of it, whether I  meant to be or not. I shoulda controlled it, shoulda been able to  stop myself. It's my fault."</p><p>"I  don't agree, but the most important thing is to give out this  before anything else happens. We can worry about blame once the  situation has stabilized."</p><p>"You're  right... I already ran into Ukyo and Mousse," he began, ignoring  the way her eye twinkled with curiosity, "and made sure Shampoo,  Cologne, and Konatsu get a dose. Here's some for you and Akane..."</p><p>She  looked quite skeptically at the handful of goo he held before her.</p><p>"You  need to burn this and inhale the smoke while meditating. Just think  of it as a healthy version of smoking."</p><p>That  earned a glare. "I'll have you know I haven't touched a  cigarette since seventh grade, Ranma. It was just one of those  stupid rebellious things kids do, and probably nowhere near as dumb  as the stuff you were doing at that age."</p><p>Suddenly  remembering an adventure with Ryoga involving sugar cubes, a jar of  kerosene, and a 'borrowed' hot glue gun, he wisely dropped that  line of conversation.</p><p>"Speaking  of stupid things..." Nabiki began again, then stopped and held out  her hand.</p><p>"Does  this outfit look like it has pockets to you?" Ranma asked, mildly  annoyed.</p><p>"Fine,  but your tab seems to be growing Ranma..." she smiled  enigmatically. "I think Tatewaki finally found out about the  curses somehow."</p><p>"Say  what?" Ranma demanded.</p><p>"He  mentioned a complication with cold water and Mousse, then shot me  with a squirt gun when I asked him about it. I'd say this was a  good thing, except that he apparently has become more paranoid then  usual and managed to kick the crap out of Mousse... probably used his  curse against him."</p><p>Ranma  pondered this information with a half-grin. "Hmm... thanks for the  heads up, Nabiki. I'll keep an eye out for anything even dumber  than usual going on."</p><p>"The  biggest problem is going to be finding Taro," Nabiki continued.  "He could be anywhere by now."</p><p>"Nah,  that's no problem," the young man replied with obvious humor.  "Just wait 'till the worst possible moment for him ta show up,  then yell out 'Pantyhose'. It'll work like a charm."</p><p>"That  is the stupidest idea I've ever heard, but what scares me is that I  think it might actually work." Nabiki shook her head. "It's  official… I've talked to you too much if that actually made sense  to me. Take me back to bed before I start striking ridiculous poses  and shouting out esoteric names for them."</p><p>Ranma  balked. "There's no way I'm trying ta sneak past Kasumi again  today. I don't need that kind of headache, and she doesn't need  any more stress."</p><p>"Just  jump, silly. I'm getting to like these rides," she replied coyly  as she hugged herself to his chest and closed her eyes.</p><p>The  martial artist blinked at her twice before deciding not to let her  teasing get under his skin. He certainly had enough on his mind  already without her odd sense of humor... and he didn't want to  encourage her to add to his girl troubles, just in case it wasn't a  joke.</p><p>Without  effort he hefted her slight weight and jumped to the roof ledge  outside her window. As she carefully eased herself back into the  room he momentarily considered dropping by Akane's room to let her  know he was back. One absent adjustment of his still tender nether  regions, however, convinced him to just get on track with  distributing the cure rather than risk further abuse to said parts  tonight. Still, there was one more matter of urgency to attend to  here.</p><p>"Nabiki?"  he called softly after her.</p><p>"What?"  she groaned, just having settled back under her covers. "You wanna  join me or something?"</p><p>"What?"  he sputtered.</p><p>"Geez,  you're just too easy to tease sometimes," Nabiki replied. "Spit  it out already, and keep it down if you're so set against seeing  the rest of the family today."</p><p>"Well,  that's kinda what I wanted to talk to ya about..."</p><p>"You  aren't planning on keeping your return a secret from them are you?"  she complained. "How the hell am I going to explain this magic  gunk?"</p><p>"That's  not it," Ranma assured her. "Look, I got some time to think  while I was away and I think I'm finally ready ta get this whole  fiancée mess taken care of."</p><p>"You're  finally going to choose?" It was Nabiki's turn for surprise.</p><p>"Well,  sorta," Ranma began to explain, then cut himself short. "I'll  explain it later. I just need you to get everyone to my mom's  house tonight around 7. All the fiancées for sure, you,  Kasumi and your dad, the Amazons, the Kunos... hell, grab Ryoga too  if he's well enough. It'll save me some trouble later if I don't  have to explain things to him after the fact."</p><p>"So  let me make sure I've got this all down: you want me to find out  everyone who was at the fight, distribute this junk to them, then  round up all of your fiancées and their various relations, and  finally get them all together at your mom's recently rebuilt home  for a little chat that will likely end up destroying said building  again," Nabiki rattled off, counting on her fingers.</p><p>"Well,  yeah, pretty much," Ranma replied.</p><p>"And you're planning on paying me for all of this effort how?"  she wondered.</p><p>"Um..."  he stalled, "with my eternal gratitude?"</p><p>Nabiki  grinned. "I'll just put in on your tab as 'services to be  discussed later', all right?"</p><p>He  wasn't sure that he liked the sound of that, but didn't see any  alternative at the moment... It was going to be quite the hassle,  after all. "Fine," he answered, silently hoping that these  services didn't involve a camera and him wearing something skimpy  and feminine again. "Goodnight Nabiki."</p><p>"Sweet  dreams, my prince!" she sang back softly in a teasing voice.</p><p>This  new twist to her teasing was going to be trouble, he decided.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Genma  was not having a pleasant morning. With the boy gone he'd much  rather be sleeping in, but recent events had unfolded in such a way  as to prevent this outcome. Life is cruel, he decided.</p><p>Before  him in the front parlor sat three uninvited guests: two boys of about  Ranma's age and a man that made him feel younger simply by looking  at him... though the lucky old coot still had his hair. One of these  boys was recognized as someone Genma would rather not see at the  moment. The others he couldn't place, so he made preparations to  run for it if the subject of a bill came up by staying nearer the  door than they were.</p><p>"Sorry  for the wait... training, you see. Very important," he lied,  fighting back a yawn.</p><p>"Quite  all right, sir," answered the oldest guest. "Your capable young  wife showed us in."</p><p>"So  what brings you to my home at such an early hour?" Genma inquired.</p><p>"We're  waiting for Ranma. He told us to wait here until he got back," the  unknown young man in a black school uniform replied in an annoyed  tone.</p><p>"Well  you'll be waiting a good long while then, I suppose," Saotome  answered, looking away towards the kitchen. "The boy has been gone  for some time now..."</p><p>"Yeah,  we know that already," snorted the familiar-looking boy.</p><p>"...and  I can't say I expect him home any time soon," Genma finished,  ignoring the interruption. "I'm afraid you'll have to find  other sleeping arrangements until he returns. I can't afford to  house you all indefinitely."</p><p>"I  hardly think we will be waiting more than an hour," offered the  older man genially. "Ranma assured us he would be here fairly  soon, just after running a few errands."</p><p>"What!"  The master of the house demanded. "Where did you get this  information from? Who are you people?"</p><p>"Name's  Kumon Ryu... I'm surprised you forgot already," the slightly  older boy answered first. "And we got this information from Ranma  when he told us to come here a little while ago. Relax old timer,  before you hurt yourself."</p><p>"Remember  whose house it is you're standing in, young man," Genma growled.  Turning his attention back towards the others he asked, "Besides, I  was only asking you two."</p><p>"I  am Mr. Kushinada," answered the gentleman with a slight head bow,  "and this is my grandson Shinosuke. We traveled here with your son  this morning by train. We wished to insure his safety; though we  tended to his injuries he was quite exhausted by his fight."</p><p>"Ah,  I thank you for your generosity then, sir," replied the  sometimes-panda. "I trust he didn't cause you much distress?"  ...or expense.</p><p>"Your  son has destroyed an irreplaceable..." Shinosuke began.</p><p>"Stow  it, shrimp. I've got real problems to discuss," interrupted  Kumon yet again.</p><p>"Yes,  there we do have a small issue to discuss, Mr. Saotome," offered  the grandfather. Ryu glowered at the man as he continued, "There  is the matter of Ranma's train ticket home and the compensation he  promised..."</p><p>Ah  crap... At the first mention of money he turned and bolted for the  door, only to find it opening into his escape path. With a heavy  thwack he collided with the solid wood fixture and sent it slamming  closed again.</p><p>"Hey!   What the heck is going on in there?" Ranma complained from  outside. "Am I not welcome in this house either now?"</p><p>"Where  the hell have you been, boy?" Genma roared as the boy in question  again attempted to inter the house.</p><p>"Out,"  Ranma replied curtly, slipping past him. "Sleep first, explain  later," he yawned.</p><p>Cursing  his son's ungrateful ways, Genma grabbed the boy's collar to  arrest his lackadaisical flight. Something from his recent memory  told him not to hold on though... too overt a threat. "Explain  now. You have duties, responsibilities here... you can't just run  off whenever you feel like it Ranma!"</p><p>The  boy stifled another yawn. He then stuck a finger in his ear, twisted  it about, and removed it swiftly with a short popping noise. "Funny,  for a second there I thought you were trying to lecture me about not  running from responsibilities..."</p><p>"Boy..."  Genma warned.</p><p>"...Which  is downright hilarious when ya think about it." Ranma continued, "I  mean really, a guy who spent mosta his life stealin' and making  deals he never had any intention of fulfillin' is now trying ta  lecture me on the subject just as I come home from potentially saving  several lives. That's just priceless."</p><p>"What  do you mean? Is this something about money?" the Shinosuke  wondered aloud.</p><p>A  little curious, but much more motivated by avoiding the line of  questioning his guests had taken, he bit back his instinctual reply  to such open criticism. "Saved lives how? What are you talking  about?"</p><p>"Just  that whole exploding gymnasium thing," Ranma began, then lost the  cockiness of his voice. "All except for the old freak I guess;  wasn't quite fast enough to save him."</p><p>"So  you've heard," Genma intoned seriously. "This is a serious  issue indeed, requiring a later conversation with the Tendos as to  the continued leadership of the school. I understand that he named  you his successor, but keeping in mind that it's your fault he's  dead..."</p><p>"Look,  I don't really care about that right now. You want to be named  grandmaster? Fine, whatever. Just let me get some sleep already;  I've got a busy day ahead of me."</p><p>"Don't  care!" Genma bellowed. "This is the school we're talking about  boy, the foundation upon which both of our lives rests! How can you  be so flippant about something so vital? Have you no shame?"</p><p>Ranma  retorted angrily, "No, it's not about the school; you're  talking about a meaningless title. I really don't care what you  and Mr. Tendo decide about the pecking order stuff... it won't  change the fact that I've learned just about everything either of  you can teach me and improved upon your techniques. I don't care  at all about that side of the art. All I want to do is become as  strong as I can be. Isn't that why we left all that behind and  trained on the road to begin with?"</p><p>Something  deep in him stirred, a whisper of a very tempting life, one free of  debts and responsibilities, that he chose to leave behind. With an  effort of will he forced the lingering temptation back down and  silently hoped that his son would never learn the true reason for  their departure. He had trained the boy well, but the fires of  ambition burned very brightly indeed in the young man's heart;  would Ranma be able to resist the poisoned lure if fate offered it to  him? Recent signs seemed to indicate no... Genma stiffened as a  chill passed through him.</p><p>"Ranma,  the leadership of the school is no small matter," Genma intoned in  a more neutral voice. "Soun and I once came to blows over this  topic soon after we sealed away the master, an incident that nearly  cost us our friendship. Luckily we came to an agreement to unite the  schools through marriage, but that's in jeopardy now."</p><p>"You  mean you finally realized that me and Akane aren't in on this whole  idea of yours?" the youth snapped.</p><p>Genma  ground his teeth in frustration at the boy's damnable stubbornness.  "Ranma, the arrangement was made to seal the fate of the school,  but with the master now dead and already having named you his  successor... well, Tendo isn't going to like the school being  completely out of his hands. This could very well start a feud if  you don't stop goofing around and marry Akane immediately."</p><p>Ranma  stood a little taller suddenly, more confident and aggressive. "I  will –not- marry Akane just to keep you and Mr. Tendo on good  terms, pop. There are way too many stipulations on my honor for me  to just up and choose one of the girls. Don't get all crazy on me  though; there still might be a way for that to happen, but only if  Akane really wants it enough, and for the right reasons."</p><p>Genma  began undaunted, "There is no discussion to be..."</p><p>"Look,  as long as you're all so talkative this morning I've got some  business to discuss," Ryu interjected. "The sooner it gets  resolved, the sooner I'm out of your way."</p><p>"This  is a private..." he tried to correct the crass comment, only to be  cut off yet again.</p><p>Shinosuke  spoke up now as well. "We've got plenty to talk about too,  Ranma. Just how do you plan to pay for destroying my family's  legacy?"</p><p>"Just  shut up, all of ya!" Ranma commanded. "If you want to talk about  this stuff you'll have to either get in line or take it up with  pops here, cause I'm goin ta bed. Now."</p><p>"Boy,  this conversation isn't over yet!" Genma shouted over the  complaints of the others.</p><p>"No,  you're right pops, it isn't over yet... but it will be tomorrow,"  Ranma stated with a strong sense of finality. "This whole fiancée  mess will be gone come sunrise tomorrow, one way or another. In the  mean time, why don't ya make yourself useful for a change and deal  with these guys' complaints?"</p><p>"What  is all this shouting about?" Inquired Nodoka from the kitchen. She  peeked around the corner with an annoyed glance, her expression  changing quickly to a smile. "Welcome home, my son."</p><p>"Oh  hey mom, how's it going?" the young man replied, pushing his hair  back from his face.</p><p>"Things  are well," she replied, taking in his appearance, "very well  indeed." Her eyes narrowed slightly as her smile took on a darker  aspect, one that Genma knew from experience meant trouble for himself  later. "I trust your opponent looks much worse for wear than you?"</p><p>Shinosuke  bristled, growling slightly as he stared balefully at Ranma's back,  turned dismissively towards him.</p><p>"Yeah,  I guess you could say that," Ranma muttered uncomfortably. "Look,  I'm really tired mom. I'll talk to ya about it later, okay?"</p><p>"Certainly,  my son. I'll look forward to hearing of your latest adventures,"  she replied simply. She watched as he mounted the stairs then turned  her gaze at one of the other young men. "And why are you here,  young man? I'd have thought after our last meeting that you would  have sense enough to stay away, 'son'."</p><p>"Uh,  hello again, Mrs. Saotome," Kumon Ryu answered quietly.</p><p>"Since  you know who I am, perhaps it would be polite of you to tell me your  name," she replied sternly. "Perhaps the real one this time."</p><p>"I'm  Kumon Ryu, maam," he responded. "I'm sorry that I..."</p><p>"Kumon?"  Nodoka repeated, cutting him off as she turned her attention to  Genma. "Was that not your sister's married name, Husband?"</p><p>"Er,  yes, dearest. I believe this boy is Mihoko's son, our nephew."</p><p>"What?"  Ryu replied with a terse, skeptical tone.</p><p>"You  thought I would share my secret techniques with just anyone?" the  elder Saotome returned with indignation.</p><p>"If  that's true then why didn't you say anything before? Why did you  make such a big deal of keeping the techniques secret?" Kumon  asked. "It would still be in the family, after all."</p><p>"I  said nothing because I didn't want to dissuade my son from facing  you, a worthy opponent that would truly test his skills. The problem  of the secret techniques, however, is not simply a matter of keeping  them within the family; rather I don't want anyone to use them  again, including even myself," Gemna stated. "They are far too  dangerous to be allowed free use."</p><p>"Well  then you've got a problem, Uncle, because Ranma has obviously been  ignoring that little stipulation of yours," Ryu informed the bald  master. "I witnessed him using not only techniques from both  schools but also some incredible new adaptations of the splashier  moves. He's obviously been practicing them for a while now."</p><p>"What?"  Genma roared. In his mind the pieces of the puzzling recent events  surrounding his son began to take shape; Ranma was falling under the  sway of the dark temptation he himself had been forced to face down  long ago. "Boy, get down here right this instant!"</p><p>The  young man in question peeked his head around the corner of the stairs  after the third such command. Behind his tangled mass of hair came  the reply, "Damn it, why can't you do anything on your own, pop?  Just pay the man and shake a few hands... no biggie."</p><p>"This  is a serious matter, boy, and I expect you to act like it!"</p><p>"Fine,  I admit it; I broke the promise and used those techniques of yours...  but only when I didn't see any other way out and I was protecting  somebody else. It's not like I used them to rob anyone..." Ranma  explained, jibing his father in the process.</p><p>"The  circumstances don't matter, nor does your intent. I wanted those  techniques sealed and I meant it!" Genma bellowed.</p><p>"I'd  say you pretty much gave up that right when you started handing em  out to anyone who asked, pop," the younger Saotome snorted, then  stifled a yawn. Turning to his cousin, he offered, "what if we  agree to alter the deal... say we can't use em for anything illegal  or something like that? Sound fair?"</p><p>"Oh  sure, you're all gracious about it now that you've got time  invested in the arts... where was this thoughtfulness when I had to  completely retrain myself from the beginning?" spat the slightly  older boy. "I demand a little more compensation for the hardships  I've gone through while you were off improving the techniques. A  damn handshake isn't going to cut it!"</p><p>"You  entered this home under false pretenses young man, causing me great  emotional stress," Nodoka interjected. "I would think these  complications would be somewhat balanced out."</p><p>The  young man tried defiantly to meet her gaze but soon realized what  Genma already knew quite well; Saotome Nodoka never backs down from  her convictions. "Fair enough..." he finally conceded,  swallowing as he averted his gaze guiltily. "But I also want  access to the Umisenken scrolls!" Ryu demanded as an afterthought.</p><p>"Are  the lot of you quite finished?" Genma growled, interrupting the  bargaining process. "What part of 'I want them to be sealed'  isn't being understood here?"</p><p>"Just  the part where your opinions on the subject count, pop," Ranma  snapped. "I'd say it's a deal, Ryu. Come back later today and  I'll find em for ya."</p><p>"No  you most definitely will not!" Genma argued. "These techniques  are incredibly dangerous and I forbid the both of you from practicing  them anymore!"</p><p>"You  know pop, you're actually right for once," Ranma ruminated. "It  seems that it really is important to know who is in charge of the  school. Seeing as how that would be me now, and considering your  moves are part of the Saotome branch of the art, I see no reason why  I can't overrule you on this."</p><p>"You  have no idea what you're doing, Ranma" Genma intoned gravely.</p><p>"My  son is just stepping up to the new responsibilities that destiny has  placed before him," Nodoka interjected again, "as any true man  would do. Don't you agree husband?"</p><p>He  looked at his wife for a moment, noting the all too familiar icy  glare that he had come to truly fear... the same look Ranma shot him  more and more often since they first visited Jusenkyo. Hanging his  head in defeat, the large man sighed a silent prayer that his son  would be more open to reason after some sleep. "Yes, dear."</p><p>"...Thought  so," Ranma smirked, then disappeared once more around the corner.</p><p>"Why  am I here?" wondered Shinosuke from a forgotten corner of the room.</p><p>"Now  what?" Genma snapped, annoyed.</p><p>Nodoka  slipped back into the kitchen, replying in a light tone, "Now that  this family business is taken care of I'll leave you to the rest  dear. I wouldn't want to burn breakfast. You're all welcome to  stay if you like."</p><p>"Your  son recently murdered a powerful spirit of nature, a holy beast known  as the Orochi," the older man explained. "With the death of this  creature the natural balance of the world has been shaken, such that  an entire forest of magical beasts that will soon be of no  consequence to anyone!"</p><p>"Orochi?   I Thought that thing was already dead according to the legends,"  Genma snorted, disbelievingly.</p><p>"Well,  now it is," added Ryu. "Nothing could survive what Ranma did to  that snake."</p><p>"What?"  Shinosuke asked, sincerely.</p><p>"You  mean you've never heard the legend before?" the older man  inquired, glancing in Ryu's direction.</p><p>"Legend  of what?" returned the forgetful boy.</p><p>"The  Orochi!" Genma yelled back. He was really beginning to be annoyed  by this kid, and the fact that the other one didn't know when to  leave wasn't helping.</p><p>"Oh,  that old legend? It was very nearly killed at the hands of the god  Susano-o millennia ago," explained the young man in surprising  detail. "Of course, the legends didn't think too long about the  fact that one of the serpent's heads was blessed with immortality.  Over time that head managed to regenerate some of the other heads in  a lesser fashion, and with time nearly regained its full potency."</p><p>"Well  not this time," Ryu interjected. "The moss got stripped from  what was left of it."</p><p>"So  the boy finished a job that supposedly should have been done a long  time ago... how is this a problem?" the rotund Saotome asked. "Did  he cheat you out of some sort of heavenly reward or something?"</p><p>"Yes!   My family was divinely charged with guarding the serpent and the  creatures of the forest enhanced by its presence. He stole my  birthright!" Shinosuke declared.</p><p>"Sonny,"  interrupted a bearded old man, "I really think this discussion  should wait for a later time. Can't you see there is already great  turmoil here since that young man's return?"</p><p>"Who  are you again?" the young man inquired.</p><p>"Not  this bit again..." moaned Ryu.</p><p>The  old man smacked him over the head. "I'm your grandfather, dolt!"</p><p>"I  have a grandfather?" Shinosuke asked, turning to Kumon for  assurance but only receiving a roll of the eyes.</p><p>The  grandfather sighed and looked in Genma's direction. "I'm sorry  for the disturbance, sir. Sometimes it seems that my grandson's  memory is an even bigger burden than that serpent ever was."</p><p>"Ah,  yes, children can be quite tiring at times," Genma intoned,  glancing at the ceiling. "Their youth fills them with a fire that  makes them believe they are invincible and infallible. For both our  sakes, I hope they grow out of it soon."</p><p>The  youth, apparently realizing he was being chided, complained, "Aren't  we here for more than just conversation?"</p><p>"Shinosuke,  we came here to see to it that the young man returned safely from his  quest. He freed us from a centuries-long burden; you should thank  him for this gift of freedom rather than demanding some sort of  punishment," the grandfather tried once to explain. "Besides, I  think it's high time we had a vacation. These old bones have been  cooped up for far too long already, and some free time might do you  some good."</p><p>"But  Grandfather..." Shinosuke whined.</p><p>"But  nothing," the old man replied. "You're acting like a slave who  tastes freedom for the first time but can only think longingly for  the whip!"</p><p>Shinosuke  growled as he turned away, flexing his hands in restless annoyance.  He then turned to Ryu, who was smirking at the older man's  comments. "Hey, you wanna spar? I've got some energy to work  off."</p><p>The  other boy stretched his arms over his head with a series of pops, and  then gestured towards the back yard. "Sure, it seems I've got  some practicing to do as well. I accept your challenge..." he  smirked, "whoever you are."</p><p>Genma  eyed the two wearily as they sauntered out the door, hoping his  nephew would have more sense than to use the sealed moves in such a  confined space. Shaking off the latest of his worries, he patted the  only other remaining guest's arm and asked, "Do you by any chance  play go?"</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>She  regarded with mixed feelings the subtle changes in the color of the  western sky. Jet, indigo, azure, aqua, amber, tangerine, and finally  a deep, glorious blood red... the death throes of the sun were a  beautiful thing, to be sure. Far more glorious than even it's  noontime brilliance, and, to her eyes at least, of a higher aesthetic  caliber than its birth had been. Viewing the daily spectacle was not  a pleasant event for her today, however, for it only served to remind  her that evening was upon her... that soon she would have to confront  her love head-on and learn the truth of the allegations against him.</p><p>It  was a preposterous thing really, one she felt guilty even  entertaining the thought of. Kuno Kodachi was not foolish enough to  believe that her beloved held her in equal esteem, but with diligence  and cunning she would no doubt prove her clear superiority to those  commoners that dared to call themselves his fiancées. It was  laughable to think otherwise.</p><p>Still,  she was not able to ignore the similarities between Ranma and the  red-headed wench who claimed his name. His smile, arrogant and  challenging; his eyes, cold and piercing; his hair, both restricted  and wild; the subject of her hate had all these and more. The only  non-gendered trait the girl had which her fiancé lacked was an  open distaste for her.</p><p>But  did he lack that trait?</p><p>"No!"  she screamed aloud to her abhorrent thoughts, defying that line of  questioning to erupt in her consciousness again. If his feelings for  her were so negative she surely would have seen some sign, some hint.</p><p>The  doctored photos, the cookies...</p><p>"No,  no, a thousand times no!" she snarled. In response to these  assaulting memories she summoned up two of her most cherished  moments; her beloved catching her fall and wearing a tuxedo while  battling for her honor. Still the seeds of doubt were growing within  her mind, and she began to dread the evening anew.</p><p>"Mistress?"</p><p>Kodachi  whirled on the intruder to her private thoughts, only to find one of  the serving staff cowering at the balcony doorway. She said nothing,  but busied herself by readjusting her pale lilac obi to better  showcase the floral pattern, dark purple blossoms in a swirl of  magenta petals.</p><p>"Miss  Kuno, you asked me to inform you when it was 6:30?" stammered the  older woman, a maid in the family's service for as long as she  could remember. Her name was of no consequence.</p><p>"Yes,  yes, return to your duties," Kodachi dismissed the servant with a  limp wave of the hand. She followed the woman from the balcony and  left her at an intersection in the adjoining hallway, heading instead  towards the main staircase and the front door.</p><p>"Sister,"  regarded her brother simply. He was dressed in a dark blue kimono  accented sparsely with silver crescent moons. It was as formal as  hers in design, but he obviously was more at ease in the heavier  clothing. Personally she much preferred the more western styles of  formal wear for their less restrictive fit, but such an occasion as  an invitation to her beloved's home required a certain amount of  reverence.</p><p>"You  are prepared, Brother?" she inquired as they entered the luxury  sedan provided for their transportation.</p><p>"I  am," he replied curtly, patting the left side of his kimono. He  seemed to be held in check somehow, his mannerisms and comments brief  and betraying nothing, as if prepared for battle. Then again,  considering their destination perhaps it would be for him. The rest  of the drive was spent in mutual silence.</p><p>They  arrived somewhat before the designated time, a rarity for a Kuno.  She was far more accustomed to forcing others to wait for her or  catching them completely unawares. Her love's father, a rather  brutish man, answered the door with obvious annoyance, ushering them  towards an open space devoid of furnishings. Judging by the pattern  of tatami mats, the area apparently consisted of two separate rooms  at most times. Just how large a gathering was expected?</p><p>The  only other occupants of the room she recognized were the  gender-confused chef, Kuonji, and her serving girl, both dressed  formally in clothing that had seen some slight wear. She sniffed  disdainfully as they entered, but said nothing. The other guest, an  angry young man in inappropriate modern garb, leaned against the far  wall, distracted by the sounds of a brewing argument.</p><p>"Boy,  why are –they- here?"</p><p>"The  same reason as Ukyo, pops; I invited them."</p><p>"But  why? For what purpose?"</p><p>"I  told ya already, you'll just have to wait until everybody's here  to find out. Now go make yourself useful while I figure this robe  out!"</p><p>"Ungrateful  brat," the host grumbled as he came back into view on his way  towards the door yet again.</p><p>In  a short time the room became filled with various persons from the  area, including the Tendo family (minus the eldest daughter), the  staff of the Cat Café, the ruffian Hibiki boy, and Ranma's  parents. Only the middle Tendo girl and Ranma's mother saw fit to  properly dress for the occasion, the rest opting for more comfortable  garments. She snickered at the attire of these guests though  inwardly she was slightly jealous of their choice; her kimono was  becoming quite warm.</p><p>Finally  Ranma entered the room, walking stiffly to a central point along the  wall and sitting as the chatter in the room ceased. Her love hardly  looked himself now, sporting a slicked-back hairstyle with long,  straight bangs in place of his usual tuft of hair and pigtail. His  determined expression and spotless white kimono further emphasized  the surreal gathering.</p><p>"Um,  hey everyone... Thanks for coming," he began, uncertainly.</p><p>"Everyone  is here, boy, so spit it out!" demanded the father.</p><p>A  cacophony of questions exploded at this cue, predominately such as  "Where the hell have you been?" and "Why are we here?"</p><p>"Give  me a chance, alright? Everything in due time!" shouted Ranma in  response. When the demands cooled to a low murmur he continued.  "First, I have to ask a question. Did anyone here –not- follow  the directions I sent for inhaling the moss?"</p><p>When  no hands rose, he nodded to himself. "Good. Next question." He  turned in the direction of the Tendos and said, "Almost two years  ago it was decided that Akane would be my fiancée. I haven't  made a big deal of it until now, but the fact remains that this  choice was offered to me though I never made it."</p><p>"Ranma..."  warned the youngest Tendo, backed up by her father.</p><p>"I'd  never force one of you into it though, so I want to get things  straight, once and for all between us," he continued. "What  about it, Akane? Are you still willing ta marry me?"</p><p>"Ranma  darling!" Kodachi found herself shouting in disbelief.</p><p>"Wha...  What kind of question is that to ask, and in front of all these  people?" The girl in question stammered.</p><p>"Yes  or no, Akane. I need to know once and for all where you stand."</p><p>"I..."  she began, then hesitated. Closing her eyes and nodding towards the  floor she finished, "Yes, damn it. What did you think I'd say  after we almost got married just a few days ago?"</p><p>"Just  makin' sure, Akane. I got no room for wishy-washiness tonight."</p><p>"Ranchan,  just what are you up to?" Ukyo demanded, on the verge of tears.  "You invited us all here just to throw that in our faces?"</p><p>"Just  give me a sec, alright?" Ranma complained. "Geez, the night  ain't over by a long shot and nothing has been decided yet."</p><p>Pacified  for the moment, the fiancées waited for him to continue.</p><p>"Okay,  given what's happened lately and the fact that she's missing I  can guess that Kasumi would want no part of this, but what about you,  Nabiki?"</p><p>"What?"  the named girl squawked in surprise. "What the hell are you  talking about Saotome? You're Akane's fiancé."</p><p>"Not  just yet I'm not... like I said, I never actually answered the  question," he stated. "So what's it gonna be? I can never  completely tell when you're joking or not so I really don't know  what to do with ya."</p><p>"You're  seriously asking me how I feel about you?" she snorted, looking  away and shaking her head. She hesitated a moment, but raised her  gaze back to the young man and replied in a tight voice, "You've  got more than enough trouble as it is, Ranma. I'm not about to get  into the middle of that mess again."</p><p>"Fair  enough," he replied with a sigh, betraying perhaps just a hint of  disappointment. Such an ego her beloved had... to feel loss over the  foolish rejection of such an offer by a heartless mercenary. "Okay,  so as it stands now I am officially engaged to Akane, Ukyo, Shampoo,  and Kodachi. Any of the rest of ya got an objection?"</p><p>"Airen  is Shampoo husband, not fiancé!" piped up the Amazon.</p><p>"Shampoo,  I never agreed ta that and I sure didn't know what I was getting  into at the time. I think I'm bein' fair in saying you're on  equal footing as the rest for now," Ranma explained, having  obviously put some thought into it.</p><p>"But  when Shampoo had jewel..." the violet-haired gaijin began to  complain, but was silenced when the ancient woman beside her rapidly  stated something in their native tongue that made Tatewaki smirk.</p><p>Kodachi  raised her hand. "I might have an objection," she said, "but  for now just a question, Ranma dearest."</p><p>"Kodachi?"  he asked, somewhat surprised.</p><p>"I..."   Her brother stood next to her, and for once his presence brought her  strength rather than simply annoyance. "I have heard a rumor I  would see disproven. Now, before this discussion goes any further."</p><p>"Yes,"  Ranma whispered, with his eyes closed.</p><p>"They  say," she began, "they say that you are in fact the same person  as the red haired girl who broke my perfect winning streak in martial  arts rhythmic gymnastics. That you are under a curse of some sort."</p><p>Ranma  nodded. "Kodachi... I'm sorry."</p><p>"It's  not your fault such rumors persist, my love!" she cried, only half  believing her own words. "We can disprove it now, in front of all  these witnesses. Brother?"</p><p>At  her comment, Tatewaki retrieved a plastic water pistol once again  from the inner folds of his robe and pointed it at the young man in  question. His hands shook slightly.</p><p>Nodoka  excused herself from the room.</p><p>"Go  ahead." Ranma replied morosely. "Get it over with." Her  brother pulled the trigger in rapid succession, wetting Ranma  profusely.</p><p>Nothing  happened.</p><p>Kodachi  and Tatewaki smiled broadly. Most of the room stood in shock.  Genma, Mousse, and Ryoga charged. Ranma jumped clear of the initial  assault, then kicked his father from behind into the other two  attackers, who collided in a pile.</p><p>Nodoka  came back into the room carrying two cups.</p><p>"It  has to be cold water," Ranma stated simply, turning to face the  siblings. Taking one container from his mother, he upended its  contents over his head.</p><p>Before  her was quite a miraculous sight. Kodachi's eyes were assaulted by  a range of shifting colors; jet, leather, sienna, and finally a shade  of bright red. Shape and mass shifted and warped, hard edges melting  into soft curves. The only constants were the bright grey-blue eyes  fixed on hers and the unmistakable expression of tightly controlled  pain.</p><p>Tatewaki's  fists balled tightly at his sides. "Which are you really, then?"  he demanded.</p><p>Upending  the other container over herself, Ranma reverted to his natural form.   "I'm a guy, Kuno. I tried ta tell you lots of times but you  just wouldn't get a clue."</p><p>"You...  you did, didn't you?" the kendoist remarked almost to himself.  "Why date with me then? Why abuse my honor so?"</p><p>"I  was trying to get something out of you every time, Kuno," Ranma  admitted. "Not one a my shinin' moments, I admit, but I guess I  owed you a little payback after all the headaches you caused me."</p><p>"Then  you all were thusly informed, were you not?" he accused the room as  a whole, gaining strength in anger. "But of course, all the  spheres of heaven have had their fill of humor at the antics of my  passion! Behold the Blue Thunder! Behold the great fool!"</p><p>No  one dared reply, but Ryoga looked away guiltily toward Akane.</p><p>"Tendo  Nabiki, we will have words later," he decreed, then left.</p><p>"Why  didn't you tell me?" asked Kodachi softly.</p><p>"Kodachi..."  Ranma began.</p><p>"You  soothed my hurts with one hand and struck with the other, never  revealing them to be one and the same. Why?" The black rose  inquired, beginning to tear up.</p><p>"Led  you..." echoed Ranma. "Come on, you're the one that was  chasing me! I never tried to..."</p><p>She  continued, ignoring him. "You saved me on the rooftops.  Complimented my cooking. Stood up for my honor to both my brother  and my rival, Asuka. You never treated me rudely while male. Why?"</p><p>"I  gotta protect people in need, plus some times I had other interests  like..."</p><p>"You  were the first man who had the will to resist me. The first to show  kindness towards me. The first to steal my heart. Why?" She was  crying freely now.</p><p>"I  didn't steal your heart, Kodachi," Ranma answered, wiping her  cheek. "You just misplaced it."</p><p>Kodachi  turned away quickly. "Yes, apparently I did. You're not at all  the man I dreamed you were, Saotome Ranma. I want nothing more to do  with you."</p><p>With  that she left, her head held proudly high despite the tears on her  chin.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Not  just yet I'm not... like I said, I never actually answered the  question," he stated. "So what's it gonna be? I can never  completely tell when you're joking or not so I really don't know  what to do with ya."</p><p>"You're  seriously asking me how I feel about you?"</p><p>She  was finding it quite hard to concentrate suddenly... how on earth  could he have asked her that of all questions, in front of all his  other suitors no less? Had her flirting been to obvious last night?  Was it just teasing or did she really mean any of what she said?</p><p>Yes,  she admitted to herself, she did mean it; despite herself she wanted  the big lug in the worst way.</p><p>Love?</p><p>Maybe  so, but she also loved her sister. Following her instincts and  saying yes would destroy that relationship, possibly even split up  her whole family.</p><p>Saying  no, on the other hand, would maintain the status quo. At worst she  and Ranma could still be friends... and when Akane drove that  marriage into the ground as she knew would eventually happen, perhaps  she and Ranma would get together (pressured by the parents, of  course, so it wouldn't be entirely her fault). That way she would  have time to finish college without a long distance relationship to  maintain, and heck, with a little experience under his belt he'd be  an even a better catch!</p><p>Put  in terms like that, the choice was clear. Besides, maybe even Ranma  couldn't protect her from all the pent-up anger and sexual  frustration in this room.</p><p>Tendo  Nabiki fights her battles on her own terms, or not at all.</p><p>"You've  got more than enough trouble as it is, Ranma. I'm not about to get  into the middle of that mess again."</p><p>The  conversation continued around her, but she wasn't really engaged  with... in it, anymore. Ranma continued running the show in a  bizarrely orderly manner, even fielding complicated legal and moral  issues from the Amazons. This was a Ranma she could really get  behind, a man she could mold into a great leader... Had she chosen  wrong?</p><p>She  was somewhat brought back to the world when the Kuno's made their  move, and was surprised at the emotional depth the two of them  offered... almost like normal people. She even felt some empathy for  Kodachi, having had her own hopes, however brief, crushed out of her  long ago by the revelation of Ranma's curse. Kuno's implied  threat barely registered as he passed, she was so caught up in  observing Kodachi's near breakdown.</p><p>Well,  that went about as well as she expected, she admitted. Better,  actually; nobody needed to be rendered unconscious.</p><p>"Anyway,  I been doing a lot of thinking the last few days about how to sort  this out, how to finally make a choice," Ranma began again, ending  her meandering thoughts. "Well, I been thinkin' about it for a  lot longer than that, honestly, but the business at the Tendo's  house the other day kinda put a rush on things."</p><p>"See,  for a while now I been trying ta stay neutral on the subject cause it  would be dishonorable to drop any of your claims. I guess I was  hoping that it would eventually work itself out, but I can see now  that waiting is only makin' things worse," he continued. "The  point of all of this is that while I was away I finally came ta  realize something..."</p><p>The  room went silent in anticipation.</p><p>Nabiki  stiffened as a teasing session with Ranma on the subject of his  sexuality and dreams suddenly came to mind. She glanced suspiciously  at the unknown young man in the back who thus far had remained  silent, noting his well-toned frame and pretty-boy hair. She closed  her eyes and made a silent prayer, "Please don't let him be gay."</p><p>"...It  ain't my choice to make."</p><p>"What!"  several voices asked as one, hers included.</p><p>"So  whose choice is it then, Ranma?" Nabiki snorted, still unhappy with  the conclusions of his 'reasoning'. "Your parents? The gods?  A magic eight ball?"</p><p>"No...  it's theirs, the girls," Ranma tried to explain. "The dispute  is really on their ends of the deal since I can't make any  honorable choice at all."</p><p>"Boy,  this is unacceptable," bellowed Genma. "You will marry Akane and  that is all there is to say... your father has spoken and you will  obey!"</p><p>"Yeah,  you've 'spoken' quite enough already, pop... that's where  this situation came from in the first place: your big mouth. No  more," the young man stated with finality. "You don't have  anything to say anymore, and neither do I."</p><p>"Ranchan,  sugar, I'm not seeing how this makes things any better. If  anything it's just going to get worse now between us," Ukyo  calmly explained. "Someone might even end up dead before things  get sorted out."</p><p>"Oh,  that's easy enough," Ranma replied, stone-faced. "If any one  of you gets killed, crippled, poisoned... anything serious like  that... I swear ta do the same back to the one that did it. Simple  as that."</p><p>"Please,  Ranma," Akane snorted. "You can't stand to spar with a girl,  much less lay a hand on any of us like that."</p><p>"Try  me."</p><p>Nabiki  shivered. The black, empty look in his eyes said it wasn't just an  idle threat, and she knew from experience that he couldn't bluff to  save his life. Just what the hell happened to him out there?</p><p>"I  really wouldn't advise it, girl," added the strange boy against  the back wall. "There's no more of that moss stuff left to fix  it up when 'psycho boy' here gets done with you."</p><p>"Ryu,"  Ranma stated calmly, "this isn't any of your business. Sorry I  couldn't find the scrolls for ya yet, but how about you take it  outside for a while. Maybe go for a walk."</p><p>"Hey,  not my problem if you gotta live up to that oath 'cause your  fiancées don't know just what kind of guy you really are,"  he replied with a shrug as he stood up and began walking. "At  least try and clean the place up again before I get back, okay?"</p><p>The  room stayed still until the front door shut, at which point Ranma  asked, "So where was I again?"</p><p>"Oh,  just threatening TO KILL ME!" Akane yelled.</p><p>"Actually,  he only said he'd do that if you killed someone else first, Akane,"  She tried to explain. "Not likely, so don't blow a gasket. If  anything, I'd say he just did you a favor," she whispered,  glancing briefly at the Amazons. Cologne returned an unamused stare.</p><p>"Anyway,  I doubt it's gonna get to that point... none of ya are going to  have time to stew over it of plan anything crazy. That's the  reason you're all here tonight."</p><p>"This  situation has been escalating for over two years, Ranma... heck,  since before you were even born in one case. I wouldn't give good  odds on it resolving tonight," Nabiki stated matter-of-factly.  "One in a thousand, maybe."</p><p>"I  don't think you've got it yet, Nabiki. I'm not asking them to  settle it tonight, I'm telling them," Ranma stated, somewhat  sadly. Turning to speak to the group as a whole he continued, "I  won't allow this situation to get any worse than it already is.  I've tried being patient but that only gave it time for the  argument to get deeper, less flexible. No more. My honor demands I  stop this before it gets any more out of hand. Maybe I can't make  a choice, but there's still one honorable path open to me:  seppuku."</p><p>Time  seemed to grind to a halt from her perspective, and yet she felt  flooded with information... overwhelmed by the speed, clarity, and  emotional impact of the scene passing her by:</p><p>Rain  falling in the koi pond</p><p>Ranma,  alone and injured</p><p>Hidden  depths revealed</p><p>A  sad smile</p><p>Real  concern for false tears</p><p>"Welcome  to my life..."</p><p>Ranma  continued after what seemed like an eternity. "Believe me, I sure  don't want ta die. There just isn't any other answer as long as  this mess is still goin' on. I'm making my stand tonight... this  situation ends by dawn, one way or the other."</p><p>Nabiki  clutched her stomach in sudden pain as her guts cramped. The night  in her memories she made a promise to him, even if he didn't hear  it, that she would make things better. That she would stop being  part of his problem. That she would look out for him, and help him  find a safe course. That she would give him back his life.</p><p>She  failed him.</p><p><b>Author's  Notes:</b></p><p>For  those trying to keep track of the story chronologically, as of the  morning of Ranma's potential seppuku exactly two weeks have passed  since the conclusion of the Saffron incident.</p><p>The  scene of Ranma's return to Nerima is a bit overly  description-packed, I acknowledge, but this is purposeful.  Specifically, some may have noticed an implied motif in the  descriptions of the four dark strangers... one very thin (Shinosuke:  Famine), one suffering disease (his grandfather: Pestilence), one  dressed in military gear (Ryu: War), and the last described more as a  specter than a real person (Ranma: Death). I know it might seem a  bit trite to call upon biblical images to describe intimidating  figures, but by evoking these allusions I hoped to hint that the  perceived threat here is spiritual rather than physical.</p><p>This  was originally planned to be the last part of act 3, but the plotting  scheme just kept getting longer to the point where it really needed  to be cut off. Sorry about the cliffhanger... I guess. I'll try  to hurry with the next chapter.</p><p>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #1 (recently promoted!)</p><p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered! Wow!</b></p>
