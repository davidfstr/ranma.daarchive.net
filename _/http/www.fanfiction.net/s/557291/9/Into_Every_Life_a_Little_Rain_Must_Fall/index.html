</div><p><b>Into  Every Life, a Little Rain Must Fall<br/></b>A  Ranma 1/2 fanfic by NemesisZero</p><p><b>Act  3: Shuffling the Deck of Fate<br/></b>Part  4</p><p><b>Pre-readers:</b><br/>Kpjam<br/>Aondehafka</p><p><b>Recap  of Last Chapter:</b></p><p>Ranma  returned victorious (and somewhat worse for wear), from  his quest for the moss of life, though Nerima had changed subtly  in his absence. He first encountered Ukyo in a state of undress  disposing of an even less covered Mousse. Rather than investigate  further on his assumptions, he chose simply to give the  couple their shares of the moss as well as instructions to care  for their associates.</p><p>His  next stop was the Tendo home, still showing signs of his previous  week's adventures. He avoided the majority of the residents  in favor of seeing Nabiki, whose services he needed to distribute  the moss and to gather the appropriate people for a meeting  at his home. After moments of romance, pain, lies, and childhood  revelations, he finally left, hoping that Nabiki's affectionate  teasing was only a joke.</p><p>Finally,  he arrived at his home, where Genma was trying to make  sense of the three houseguests Ranma brought to Nerima: Shinosuke  and his grandfather, as well as Kumon Ryu who was revealed  as Ranma's cousin on his father's side. After resolving several  separate arguments, one with the help of his recently acquired  grandmaster status, Ranma finally went to bed. That  evening a gathering was held in the Saotome home for all  the fiancées, most of their family members, and even some assorted  rivals. The topic of discussion was Ranma's declaration that  in his view the burden of choice fell on the girls rather than  himself and that if they didn't resolve the dispute by dawn he  would end it on his own, through seppuku. The situation was somewhat  simplified however by the Kunos' final acceptance that Ranma  was indeed cursed, leading to their rapid departure.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>A  veritable wall of sound, composed of a variety of tones and  pitches, accosted his senses at maximum volume from every direction.   It represented a selection of sounds and utterances, long  and short, angry and distressed, booming and begging... all aimed  at achieving a single purpose: thwarting his attempt to break  free or die trying. "Not this time..." he whispered to himself,  "I won't let you stall this out any longer. We're facing  up to this now."</p><p>Apparently  his soft response, not intended for the crowd's ears,  managed to quiet them with curiosity where a shout probably would  have failed. One voice, a voice he had long ago learned to ignore,  continued unabated. "Are you completely out of your mind, Boy?"  Genma demanded.</p><p>"Not  at all, Pop," Ranma replied, keeping his tone fairly low.   "I think I'm just finally putting it ta work is all."</p><p>"There  is no way this will work, idiot! Certainly not with these  two fanatics," Akane gestured towards Ukyo and Shampoo, earning  a low growl from the Amazon. "Just take back this stupid pledge  of yours and I'm sure we can all just forget about it. Act  like it never happened."</p><p>"I  ain't gonna do that," Ranma snapped. "Look, it seems to me  that everyone in this room thinks they know better than me how I  should live my life... tonight a few of ya get a chance to prove  it."</p><p>"Oh  that's so you, Ranma," sneered the previously quiet Ryoga,  "trying to make Akane the scapegoat for your own shortcomings...   I won't stand for it!"</p><p>"Fine,"  the formerly pigtailed youth said uncaringly. "Door's  that way, pal. Feel free to leave anytime you want. In fact,  who invited you here anyway?"</p><p>"That  would be you, Ranma," Nabiki answered without looking up  as she continued scribbling furiously in a small notebook.</p><p>Ryoga  grinned.</p><p>"That  doesn't matter anyhow. The point is that you just got out  of the hospital. Happosai didn't." Ryoga's grin faded as Ranma  continued. "Heck, half the people in this room were injured  in some way last week, and alla' that is my fault. But it's  not just me. It's this situation, this damned mess of honor,  love, and jealousy we're all caught up in. If it wasn't for  all this I wouldn't have lost my control... and we'd all be better  off. Even you, Ryoga."</p><p>"But  is no good Airen do too too rash thing," Shampoo chimed in.   "Ask more than can be done in night, maybe ever!"</p><p>"Give  him a chance, Shampoo," Mousse interrupted, giving the girl  reason to stare incredulously at him. "If Ranma's serious enough  about this to put his life on the line then I say we owe it  to him to give it an honest try. At least he's finally trying to  fix things, after all."</p><p>"Ya  know, as things stand I wish I never went on that training  trip in the first place," Ranma sighed, nodding at the unexpectedly  helpful Mousse. "All of ya probably would have been better  off if I never came and screwed up your lives. Heck, maybe  I could have been happier myself if I was just another normal  kid."</p><p>"But  we can't go back, Ranma," Ukyo said in a near whisper, finally  finding her voice. "Good or bad, this is where we are.<br/>All  we can do is try to forgive each other for our stupid mistakes,  maybe find a way to work things out if we just take the time."</p><p>"That's  all I've done since this mess began, just waited for things  to sort themselves out and tried to keep things under control.   Can't you see that it's not working, that in fact it's just  getting worse every day?" he asked apologetically. "How many  people have to die before it gets resolved? If I have anything  to say about it, just one more: me."</p><p>"No  one has to die, Boy... just pick Akane once and for all like  we all know you want to and get it over with," Genma added. "Stop  being so damned sanctimonious and end these other girl's pain.   Enough of the drama already."</p><p>Ranma  answered the charge with an accusational glare and a low,  throaty growl. Genma flinched.</p><p>"Anyway,"  Ranma continued, "the time for talking ta me about all  this is long past. Now the girls need to get together and start  talking about the here and now, unless of course they really  do want me dead. Why don't the three of you go on upstairs  to my room, away from all these distractions."</p><p>"I  think I'll join them," Nabiki added, rising to her feet.</p><p>"No,  you no sway us talking," Shampoo complained.</p><p>"You  said yourself that this is pushing the impossible as it is,  Shampoo," she answered. "Don't you think this would go a little  smoother with a moderator to keep the discussion from just completely  locking up?"</p><p>"Moderators  are supposed to be without bias though," Ukyo chimed  in. "That hardly qualifies you."</p><p>"What,  you want me to lie?" Nabiki snapped. "Of course I'd prefer  my sister come out of this happy... but I know it's fair to  say that she'd be happier with him alive than dead if it came down  to it. I promise I won't get in the way if the three of you end  up picking someone other than Akane."</p><p>"Shampoo  agree... but also promise throw you out on butt if not  fair."</p><p>"Whatever,"  Ukyo sighed. "Let's just get this started already."</p><p>Ranma  watched the girls take their leave from the room before  continuing. "Well, that's the end of the announcements for  the evening. Feel free to leave or stay, as you wish. I'm going  to go outside for a bit and get a little air. If anyone has  anything else to say that doesn't involve undermining this decision...  I'd welcome your company."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Age is an excellent teacher of the virtue of patience. Good  thing, considering the time it was taking Ryoga to finish his  conversation with Ranma. Still, even she had her limits, and this  was an important matter.</p><p>"...so  you've gotta tell her, man," Ranma insisted. "If you can  do that I'll give ya my full blessings. Depending on how things  work out, of course."</p><p>"Well,  maybe you aren't the jerk I thought you were," Ryoga replied.   "Thanks, Pal."</p><p>Cologne  seized the opportunity to break in. "I'm sorry to interrupt,  young man, but I've something to discuss with Son-in-law  here that might not be able wait."</p><p>"I  was wondering why you were so quiet earlier. Have a seat,"  Ranma replied, staying carefully neutral. "You aren't here  to try and dissuade me, are you?"</p><p>"No,  though I do believe this to be the stupidest action I've  yet witnessed, youngling. If it weren't for current circumstances  I'd be much freer to save you from this foolishness,  but unfortunately for you that's not the case."</p><p>"Glad  we got that cleared up," Ranma smirked.</p><p>She  ignored his sarcasm; there were more important matters at  hand. "I've been trying to put something of a puzzle together,  and I think you might be holding several of the pieces. Tell  me, how exactly did you manage to defeat the God-king of the Phoenix  Tribe?"</p><p>"Barely,"  he smirked, though she sobered him with a displeased  glance. "We were battling in midair, mostly using these  magic staves with powers based on fire n ice. I scored a couple  a hits but nothing I did seemed to keep him down. Even chopped  off his wings, but he just grew em right back."</p><p>"That  would be in keeping with what I know of him, yes," she replied,  trying to stay neutral as well. It wouldn't do to have the  boy learn that before the last few days she hadn't believed such  a creature even existed... The Amazons' traditionally oral history  tended more towards exaggeration than fact sometimes.</p><p>"I  had him easily beat in skill and conditioning, but it didn't  amount ta much when I had to keep dodging blasts that blew holes  through the mountain. That's where he made his mistake though,"  Ranma smirked, "kinda the same as Herb; he filled the whole  area with so much lingering heat that I was able ta blast him  with a massive Hiryu Shoten Ha, charging it through the ice staff  to make it extra cold. Guess I owe ya for teaching me the technique,  actually."</p><p>Cologne  smiled slightly. "Nonsense, son-in-law. I'm pleased  you put my teachings to such creative use. Still that doesn't  explain everything Mousse told me... how did you manage to  overpower the phoenix's blast with a -downwards- moving Hiryu Shoten  Ha? Why did he appear to be cut to ribbons when your attack  struck?"</p><p>"Um,  yeah. about that," Ranma fidgeted, rubbing the back of his  head. "Well, the answer to the first is partially Akane... she  was immune to his blasts because of her condition, and she somehow  managed ta physically punch a hole through it so I could see  him. I think she just fell outta my shirt and I got lucky, but  it was really strange how she felt hot allova sudden... well, your  guess is probably better than mine on that count."</p><p>"Fascinating,"  the elder replied.</p><p>"As  ta the rest, right at the end I found a reserve of strength  I didn't know I had and really poured it all into one shot.   Then I sorta tweaked the technique with a special attack pop  invented... I'd tell you more but it's kinda a family secret."</p><p>"Oh  no, not entirely secret my boy," she cackled. "If my guess  is right you demonstrated the technique to me shortly after I  arrived in Nerima. You probably don't remember, though, seeing as  how you weren't exactly yourself at the time."</p><p>"What?"  he asked, apparently playing innocent.</p><p>"The  nekoken, Ranma. I told you at the time that I'd seen it  before. What I didn't tell you is that I'd never seen it with claws  like yours... in fact I've never seen the like anywhere else.   It gave me quiet a start when I realized you were somehow channeling  raw ki, so much so that I realized I might not be able to  beat you without killing you."</p><p>"Huh?  But I didn't learn the technique till almost eight months  ago."</p><p>"Perhaps  you simply didn't learn to consciously control it until  then. Regardless, I realized that day that you were quite a special  find indeed, a natural spiritual adept. The ease with which  you've discovered new techniques since then only goes to prove  it," Cologne explained, before suddenly becoming rather morose.   "... at least I thought that was it until recently."</p><p>"And  why the change?"</p><p>"Partially  because I saw you change, lad," she replied cryptically.   "Tell me, how long has your curse been acting... unusual?"</p><p>Ranma  paused for a moment before answering. "Well, I first noticed  it the day after the fight in the gym. I tried ta change back  into a guy but it was different... seemed ta take longer than  normal, like it was fighting somethin'. Hurt like hell, too.   It's been getting worse since then, but if I know I'm gonna change  I can handle it."</p><p>"Very  troubling, especially combined with your outburst at the  school," she confided. "I must admit I'm surprised anyone survived  the outpouring of yin you unleashed there, son-in-law. I'm  even more surprised it affected only our chi rather than dissolving  us completely."</p><p>"Good  thing I woke up from that damn dream then," Ranma stated  without humor. "I realized something was really wrong and just  kinda forced it all up, burned the reaction out before it could  finish I guess."</p><p>"Dream?"</p><p>"Yeah,"  he replied, looking away. "I was having these stupid  recurring nightmares ever since Jusendo... there's this pale  guy in a dark robe who keeps talking about teaching me and my  destiny and stuff. Weird, huh? Last time I had it I decked him  though, and I haven't had the dream since."</p><p>She  stumbled back slightly as images ran through her mind, dark  illustrations and nervously written notes from a tome she'd not  dared to consult in ages. This could be much, much worse than  she originally thought. "This... man. Describe him for me, Ranma.   I need details."</p><p>"Well,  it's kinda hard to remember... haven't had the dream for  a few days now," Ranma stated with puzzlement. "I remember he  was really pale and thin, like a corpse almost. He was wearing  this dark robe, but I can't be sure what color it was... it  kept changing. His eyes were the worst... he didn't really have  any, just these spots of flame. Oh, and once he actually had  a name: Narou Mizumei, I think. Pretty screwed up dream, huh?"</p><p>"By  the gods..." she whispered, fearfully. "I'll be back soon,  Son-in... Ranma. Until then try to avoid changing, or any use  of chi, or even sleeping for that matter."</p><p>"Yeah,  fine, whatever," he replied as she left, looking up towards  the window of his room, "assuming it will matter tomorrow anyway."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"I  just don't see where we can even begin to make any compromises,"  Akane admitted with exasperation. They'd been arguing  for over three hours now, stating repeatedly the basis for  their claims and why each thought hers was, of course, the strongest.   "What could we possibly say at this point that would change  the way we feel or that we don't know already?"</p><p>"I  don't know, but we've got to keep trying. There must be some  way to make sense of all of this." Nabiki sighed, flipping back  once again to the beginning of her notes for the evening.</p><p>"We  should just march right back down there and make Ranma say  who he wants," Akane replied scornfully. "Otherwise we're just  going to keep voting for ourselves all night long."</p><p>"Shampoo  agree. Is no good idea this thing. It no fix anything."</p><p>"Well,  we could make a rule that you have to vote for someone  besides yourself," Ukyo offered.</p><p>"Oh  hell no," Akane replied heatedly. "If we did that it would  be even more of a simple popularity contest that the first vote  was!"</p><p>"Look,"  Nabiki tiredly replied. "We've been over this already.   Ranma clearly doesn't feel capable of making a choice, either  because of his honor or for emotional reasons. He honestly  doesn't seem to know what he feels beyond a general attraction  and general friendliness towards all of you. Trust me on  this... he told me so after the wedding, and I told this all to  Ukyo earlier."</p><p>"But  he must have -some- preference," the younger Tendo complained.   "It just isn't possible for us all to be completely balanced,  what with how different we are and everything." "And  how differently we treat him..." Ukyo added.</p><p>"What  the hell do you know, anyway?" Akane snapped. "It's not  like you've suggested anything constructive. Heck, you've barely  said a word all night!"</p><p>"I  stopped talking when I realized it was all pointless," the  chef whispered in reply.</p><p>"Hey,  if you're ready to quit then just give your vote to one  of us and get it over with," the most vocal girl snapped.</p><p>"Yeah,  you'd like that wouldn't you, Sugar. Like I'd ever leave  Ranchan to live out his days with your senseless beatings or  under her institutionalized slavery."</p><p>"Amazons  no keep slaves!"</p><p>"Yeah,  sure... Mousse sure seems free to do whatever he pleases,"  Ukyo replied, but turned away afterwards with a grimace.</p><p>"Girls,  really," Nabiki interjected. "If you start arguing again  we'll just end up wasting even more time. Let's try to keep  a little focus here, okay? How about if we go back to taking  turns speaking again?"</p><p>Akane  stood up and stretched, ignoring the others bickering. She  just didn't have the strength left for a good argument anymore.   "This would be so much easier if we just had some hint of  how he feels. Why couldn't he do something sensible like writing  a diary or something?"</p><p>"Because  if he had, I would have known about it," Nabiki admitted  ruefully. "And Ranma wasn't stupid enough to think I wouldn't  have read every page, and given half the chance the rest of  you would have done the same. Besides, it wouldn't prove anything  anyway... like I said."</p><p>"This  stupid room," Akane complained, kicking his rolled futon  out of the way. "There's nothing in it that has any personality  at all, nothing that even remotely says who lives here,  much less what he really wants. Not one picture, or keepsake,  or note, or anything."</p><p>"What  Violent Girl expect, big light-up sign say he love Shampoo?"  said girl asked sarcastically. "He just move in, no time  make comfortable yet."</p><p>"Seriously  though, the only difference between this room and the  one he used to sleep in is that his father doesn't share it with  him," Nabiki pointed out. "Well, it's a little cleaner and there  are fewer dresses in the closet, but besides that, nothing. Ranma's  quite the minimalist."</p><p>"Minimalist,  hell," Ukyo snapped. "He never had the money to  buy anything with, on account of you."</p><p>"Yes,  let's all yell at the one person in the room who really  has nothing to do with the important task at hand," Nabiki mocked.</p><p>Ukyo  said nothing, choosing rather to growl and turn away.</p><p>Shampoo  likewise suddenly found Ranma's backpack, already thoroughly  searched twice over for any hints whatsoever, more engaging  than the conversation.</p><p>"Maybe  we should take a break for a bit, get some fresh air and  cool down a little," Nabiki suggested. "It certainly wouldn't  be any worse than stewing in silence here."</p><p>Akane  glared at her opponents with open disgust as they sauntered  out. If they would just stop being so annoyingly persistent  they'd be able to admit that Ranma clearly cared more for  her than them. She was the one he almost married, the one he stayed  with, and the one he went to the greatest lengths to ,  Ranma's family even backed her claim. It was the obvious choice.   Why were they so completely unable to see it from her side?</p><p>Did  they really hate her so much that they would just let Ranma  die rather than admitting that she was the only valid option?</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>It  was that time of night when time no longer seemed to matter,  that great expanse between evening and dawn when the waking  world shut down and a person could finally feel alone even in  a city of millions. Rarely did Xian Pu find the occasion to experience  the peculiar silence of the city at night, the strange barrenness  of this concrete and steel landscape when the hustle and  bustle cooled. Training and work kept her on a regular schedule,  but those times when she could afford to stay up she loved  to marvel at this stillness, a dark stasis that made her own  home at night seem cacophonous by comparison.</p><p>She  sighed and took another sip of the strong western coffee hr  airen's mother had thoughtfully provided, enjoying the contrast  between its heat and the air's cool, as well as the tingling  sensation the drink gave her nerves. A faint horn blew in  the distance, accompanied by the deliberate thrum of a passing late  commuter train, reminding her that there was always someone else  awake somewhere in this land.</p><p>This  was the third such break the girls had taken for the night,  called by Nabiki on account of her sister's irrational declaration  that they should just have a fight to resolve the issue.   Well, actually it was her refusal to back down from the idea  when the others balked that caused the communication to stall  again.</p><p>Xian  Pu wasn't stupid enough to accept such an idea. Certainly  she felt confident in her ability to defeat either girl under  normal conditions, but this situation was far from normal and  in this case her skill would be a detriment; it might give them  reason to work together. Ukyo was a challenging opponent, but  with the help of the usually negligible Akane (who already clearly  preferred the chef's company to hers) she doubted if she could  keep the upper hand.</p><p>"Why  do they hate me so much?" she wondered, not for the first  time, as she rubbed her tired eyes. It wasn't just the situation,  strained though it was, nor was it plain jealousy of her  physical and martial superiority. It wasn't even restricted to  just the rivals... some potential allies like Ryoga held a general  condescending opinion of her for no good reason, too.</p><p>Truth  be told, most people in the city had the same look towards her;  an attitude of smug superiority and an automatic distrust of her  at first glance. The  Japanese mindset seemed based, from her perspective, on a  deeply held belief that they were just inherently better then everyone  else.</p><p>Since  arriving here nearly two years ago she still had not made  a single friend to just talk to and spend time with outside of  Mu-Mu' and Great Grandmother (who were both frankly useless in  this regard) ...and of course Ranma. Mu  Tsu thought Ranma was just as blatantly racist as just about  everyone else, as he had tried to convince her several times.   The poor male seemed unable to realize that it wasn't personal,  that Ranma acted that smug towards -all- of his opponents  as a means to break their focus. Elder Ku Lon had just the  opposite problem... she was too biased in favor of Amazon culture  to understand why Shampoo was even concerned by the Japanese  feeling likewise.</p><p>Ranma  didn't much care for the rules of her society (not that  she took it personally, as he didn't seem too keen on -any- rules),  but he was still generally accepting of her opinions as not  fundamentally less valid than any other person's. Perhaps it was  his travels outside the country that allowed him a more accepting  view, a more worldly perspective on social differences. Ranma's  accepting and forgiving nature, especially when compared to  the rest of his society, was one of the major points of attraction  she held for the boy.</p><p>Well...  the non-physical ones, anyway.</p><p>Of  course, this trait wasn't entirely unique. Her newest Airen  had, as far as she could so far tell, a similarly open perspective  that was especially striking given his heartfelt adoption  of traditional Japanese culture. Perhaps his studies of cultures  outside his own had a similar effect to Ranma's travels? The  boy was foolish and vain, even more so than Ranma, but perhaps  in a charming way.</p><p>No,  she shook her head clear of such thoughts. She knew hardly  anything about Tatewaki, barely an acquaintance in her time  here. It was so utterly unfair that she was bound to him at such  a crucial moment, tying her hands in the discussion at hand. Giving  up on Ranma for his own sake was essentially the same as agreeing  to marry the other young man, but winning the competition  meant she still wasn't assured of ending up with him. Fate  was just so cruel!</p><p>A  sudden shift broke her reverie, drawing her attention down to  the yard below, long since abandoned by Ranma's visitors. Where  before was only stillness, she now felt a presence... somewhere  down below, unseen. She sharpened her vision, scanning the  grounds with a concentration towards the trees in the far corner.   Any interlopers would be personally dealt with. The  slight feeling moved again, out of the trees into the middle  of the yard, but still she saw nothing. She was almost convinced  it was just her imagination when suddenly the air blurred  as if heated, folding back upon itself to reveal the strange  young man from earlier, whom Ranma asked to leave. She prepared  to jump down and meet the trespasser when he collapsed to  his knees, drenched in sweat and breathing rapidly as if exhausted.</p><p>"Geez,  Ranma," he asked between grasping breaths, "How do you...  keep it up... so long?"</p><p>"You  must be out of practice, I guess," her beloved's voice answered  before he appeared, again as if from nowhere, next to the  man. He was topless and his skin also glistened with sweat in  the moonlight. "The other versions of the technique aren't nearly  as much fun, but if you want I can try to demonstrate them for  you too."</p><p>"Won't  your dad be pissed when he finds out about this?" asked  the camouflaged youth.</p><p>"Ah,  why would he care as long as we're discrete? It's still  in the family..." Ranma's voice trailed off. He turned his face  upwards to stare right at her. Shampoo nervously waved back,  unsure of the situation.</p><p>He  leapt casually up to perch on the railing beside her. "Look,  can I trust you to keep whatever you saw a secret? I'm trying  to take care of some private business... family only kinda stuff.   Understand?"</p><p>Shampoo,  asked, hesitantly, "Ranma... was no doing sex with other  boy, right? Just misunderstand, yes?"</p><p>"What?"  he squawked, nearly falling off the balcony. "Of course  I wasn't!"</p><p>"Whew,  Shampoo sorry ask," she replied sheepishly. "Airen have  habit of say wrong things, very bad luck. Shampoo no really think  that, just check."</p><p>"Look,  I was just taking care of a debt of honor," he explained  with frustration. "It's nothing like that, but it is something  I'd prefer to keep secret."</p><p>"Shampoo  understand. Airen make sure all things okay if worst  happen. Is good thing, even if no need," the Amazon replied.</p><p>"Anyway,  shouldn't you be inside talking with the others, Shampoo?"  he asked, neutrally.</p><p>"No,  Money-Girl say take break after stupid Akane idea." She explained.</p><p>"Great,"  Ranma sighed.</p><p>"Airen  no worry. Shampoo try extra hard convince them, be safe  soon!"</p><p>"Oh,  I'm sure if there is a solution you girls will find it,"  he replied with false confidence. "Well, looks like the others  are getting together in there, so you better get going. Oh,  could you send Nabiki outside for a sec, downstairs I mean? I  got something to take care of with her too, just in case."</p><p>"Airen  no sex Nabiki!" she complained with an exaggerated pout,  causing his eyes to go wide. "Was joke! Airen too, too easy  upset." She went back in with a much better mood, leaving her  soon-to-be-husband grumbling.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Dawn  was only a few hours away now. She could feel it deep in  the pit of her stomach, a dull throbbing ache that would only grow  worse as the time passed. The clock calmly stated it was exactly  3:48, but that was unimportant. What was important was that  this was probably the last hour of Ranma's life.</p><p>The  conversation died some time ago. Shampoo came back in with  a wide smile, which of course set off Mt. Akane' on yet another  tirade, leading to an argument, leading to yet another period  of angry silence. Or, in Ukyo's own case, contemplative silence.</p><p>Nabiki  didn't get the memo, apparently. She had been thinking  aloud and scribbling in her notes this whole time, trying  to find some sort of compromise that everyone would accept.   It was a little disconcerting, really, to see her arguing  all three sides of the case on her own. Then again she had  to, considering nobody else seemed to have anything left to say  besides the occasional one or two word answer.</p><p>"Look,  it's really simple," Nabiki sighed, attempting to explain  her latest angle. "Since there's only three if you all it  takes to save Ranma's life is for one of you to vote for someone  besides yourself. That way he lives and you'll be the one  he thanks for it. By dropping out you can make sure that Ranma  ends up at least with the person you think is second best for  him. Heck, if you're so damn angry then think of it as a way to  make sure that someone else will never get him."</p><p>The  others didn't seem to be even listening anymore. Of course  she had tuned out quite a few of Nabiki's ideas before this  one, so Ukyo couldn't say too much.</p><p>"Look  at the alternatives then!" Nabiki continued, angry. "If  none of you backs out then you all lose, and Ranma dies. There's  nothing to gain by being stubborn!"</p><p>Oh,  but there was. Ukyo realized some time ago that the only  way to really win this contest of wills was to stay in and hope  that one of the others chose her... and that's why she was doing  her best not to do anything to bother them. Now all she had  to do was wait out their little staring contest and reap the rewards.</p><p>That  something throbbed deep in her guts again, hot and unpleasant.   The truth was that she was gambling his life on the hopes  that she would come out on top. She knew, unequivocally, that  was she was doing was selfish and callous, but for some reason  she just couldn't seem to care enough to stop. She wanted to  feel sad, to pity Ranma for this burden, to rage against the situation  that made him feel this way... but could only do so in a  superficial way.</p><p>She  did want to marry the boy, really. Since she was a little  girl it was all she wanted, all that drove her was the idea  of being Mrs. Saotome Ukyo. All the things she did, even when  she no longer considered herself a she, were for him. Even the  worst of it, the humiliating and depraved things she had done to  try to kill the remnants of her abandoned femininity... all of it  was always because of her love.</p><p>Why  then was she trying to convince herself?</p><p>The  answer, though Ukyo was loathe to admit it, was that there  was a part of her that didn't want to let go of her darker times.   This aspect of her personality felt that she would have been  better off without him, wished he'd stayed wherever he ran off  to rather than coming back yesterday. He owed her for lost time,  for all the hurts she suffered on his behalf then and now. Even  if the initial mistake wasn't his (and she had nothing to go on  for this but his own word, after all), the fact that he hadn't rectified  the situation immediately upon finding out galled her. Every  ill that had befallen her in Nerima, including her recent mistake  with Mousse, was at least indirectly Ranma's fault. What  was this seppuku stunt, really, but another escape attempt  from their engagement... this time into realms where she dare  not follow?</p><p>Oh,  but she was getting far too worked up, she realized. She  had to keep her cool, not attract attention to herself until the  proper moment. Momentary vengeance was less preferable to a lifetime  of winning, after all.</p><p>Luckily  her inner turmoil went unnoticed, as Akane and Shampoo  were arguing again for some reason. Ukyo quickly looked away  to keep the hint of a smile from showing. It  was turning out to be a win/win situation for her; Regardless  of the outcome she could finally go home with her honor  intact and the shadows of her misspent youth dead and buried.   Of course she preferred to win... but if it came to the worst  she could get over him, in time.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>She  had never been one for mornings, like Kasumi. Sure, she understood  at least indirectly that feeling the first rays of dawn  was like "a warm kiss from the world" and that waking at that  time "promoted harmony with the natural world." Her personal  experiences though had always been more along the lines of  "fiery daggers of eye-seeking vengeance" and "wasted  time better  spent dreaming." In the personal world Tendo Nabiki inhabited  sunrise was an enemy to be feared, the harbinger of yet another  pointless day in Nerima.</p><p>The  dawn was nearly here. She could feel it somehow; a certain  tightness in her shoulders and a slight tremor down her spine  offering clues from her subconscious that the rational part of  herself could not explain, but trusted nonetheless. It was, after  all, a carefully groomed defense mechanism against the horrors  of wakefulness.</p><p>Nobody  ever died in her dreams. Not since she learned how to  control them, anyway.</p><p>But  this was no dream, no nightmare to be contained. Try though  she might, the situation had progressed despite all her attempts  to control it. Ukyo had long ago shut down, withdrawn completely  from the discussion, and without her as a balancing factor  the other two fianc‚es' had found a focus for their frustrations  in each other. It was a stalemate, and in this game that  was the only real way she could lose.</p><p>She'd  tried every angle she could think of to seek a compromise,  every scheme and ploy at her disposal to get the girls  to just drop all their pride and anger so Ranma could live. She'd  even pressed on after Ranma talked with her, trying to settle  his affairs as if he'd already resigned himself to hopelessness.   She'd given the situation her all, but it just wasn't  enough.</p><p>Nabiki  slowly rose to her feet without a word. Ukyo glanced up,  but quickly turned away again. The others were too intent on staring  balefully at one another to pay her any mind.</p><p>She  wandered out onto the balcony, content for a moment just to  close her eyes and deeply inhale the fresh, crisp air. Opening  them brought the sight of the eastern sky alight with a much  brighter shade of blue than the deep indigo the other directions  offered. The distant clouds glowed from below with a faint  orange light.</p><p>She  turned away from the reminder, finding instead the sight of  Ranma sitting alone on the lower roof over the kitchen, facing his  oncoming fate. He didn't seem to notice her, being intently focused  with tightly furrowed brows on the piece of paper before him.   Writing the traditional final haiku, no doubt, and probably struggling  with his calligraphy. With a grumble he wadded up the paper  and tossed it to the ground, where it joined several other rejected  attempts.</p><p>She  smiled at the sight, finding a curious pleasure in it. Ranma  was always so hopeless whenever he tried something new, so given  to displays of frustration that she secretly found cute in their  special childlike way. More charming, however infuriating it  might occasionally be when directed at her own schemes, was the  willful stubbornness that he drew upon whenever these situations  arose, an all-consuming devotion to victory at any cost.   That quality, more than any degree of skill, guile, or luck  the young man possessed, was the chief reason that Saotome Ranma  never lost when it really counted.</p><p>Then  his face was struck by the first rays of dawn and his eyes  closed in resignation.</p><p>"It  couldn't be happening," her mind whirled. "Ranma never loses,  never gives up. It's who he is, the very essence of his being!"</p><p>The  young man quietly gathered up his things and leapt down to  the back yard where an area had been prepared earlier in the night.</p><p>"I  just have to wake up, that's all. It's dawn and the nightmares  are trying to get me but I can make them go away or escape  them like I always do. Ranma can't die in my dreams."</p><p>He  took his seat on a white cushion and turned his focus one last  time on a piece of paper. This time his face remained relaxed,  his hand steady and his brush strokes even.</p><p>"What  more can I do? What more can I sacrifice?"</p><p>His  mother approached with an official gait, carrying two objects.   The first she laid before him. The second she began to unwrap.</p><p>Nabiki's  mind raced in every direction, drawing in random snippets  of information that helped the problem at hand not a bit.   There had to be something she'd missed, some angle she'd failed  to exploit. Something, anything...</p><p>And  all at once it hit her; something at the time so insane and  forgettable that she'd instantly dismissed it. Though it still  made no sense to her, Nabiki was inexplicably drawn to yell a  single word at the top of her lungs:</p><p>"Pantyhose!"</p><p>The  exclamation had a result comparable to a gunshot against the  early morning stillness. All eyes in the yard snapped to her with  looks of bewilderment. The panda wandered outside and joined  his family in confusion. A neighbor thrust her head from the  safety of her home to glance about angrily. Its nonsequitor might  was even enough to shock the deadlocked participants to come  outside and see what she was yelling about. She  had no answer to give to their questioning glances, but the  knot of improbability at Nerima's heart refused to let this perfect  opportunity slide. As if on cue, the beast-that-should-not-be  descended on the yard with an angry bellow.</p><p>"I  guess we'd better go help Ranma," one of her balcony mates  reflexively sighed.</p><p>Nabiki  found her fire again, wheeling on the girls before they  wasted this final opportunity. "You want to help him? Then all  of you go back inside and make use of the time this distraction  just gave you!"</p><p>"But..."</p><p>"But  nothing! Get back in there right now or I'll make each and  every one of you suffer for the rest of your lives!"</p><p>"Nabiki?"  Akane cautiously inquired.</p><p>"Go.   Talk. Now," she growled in response.</p><p>Nabiki  had no idea how she would accomplish such a threat, but  luckily the girls didn't call her bluff. They went back grudgingly  to their chosen spaces in Ranma's room and once again opened  the lines of communication. Unfortunately the participants and  facts of the debate had changed not a note. This resulted almost  immediately in another argument between Akane and Shampoo, while  Ukyo acted, ineffectually, as a peacemaker.</p><p>Something  broke in Nabiki, something that had remained solid and  dependable through all kinds of tribulations but could not withstand  the frustration any longer. "Shut up! Shut up, shut up,  shut up!" she screamed at the others, pointing at each girl in  return.</p><p>"Money-girl  say talk... Why no make up mind?"</p><p>"I  know what I said but this isn't getting us anywhere. Just  shut up and let me think," she snapped. "There must be a way  to solve this..."</p><p>"God,  let's just vote again or something," Ukyo sighed.</p><p>"Tried  that already... you all just voted for yourselves, remember?"  Nabiki answered.</p><p>"What  if we made it a rule," Akane haltingly suggested, "that  you had to vote... for someone else?"</p><p>Nabiki  looked up hopefully. "I thought you hated that idea when  we first brought it up, sis..." and why the hell was Ukyo smiling?</p><p>The  votes were made on paper, each girl carefully hiding the results  from the others as Nabiki checked each one.</p><p>Ukyo  voted for Shampoo.<br/>Akane  voted for Ukyo.<br/>Shampoo  voted for Akane.</p><p>"What  the hell, Shampoo!" the miffed chef demanded. "You two  spent the whole damned night at each others throats? How could  you vote for her?"</p><p>"You  can't start arguing again," Nabiki pleaded. "There's no  time for this crap!" If only there was some way to take the pressure  off, to take the competition angle out of the problem...</p><p>"Shampoo  no like Violent-Girl, but at least she fighter. Amazons  no like quitters."</p><p>Quitters?   "That's it..." Nabiki whispered.</p><p>"What,  you turned on me just because I wouldn't take part in your  little time wasting fight?" Ukyo spat, regaining her feet. "If  you want to see a real fighter then bring it, jackass!"</p><p>"Stop,  both of you! I've got the answer: You should all just  quit!"</p><p>"Yeah,  quit with the posturing, already," Akane added. "Let's  see what she's got in mind while we still have time to make  it matter."</p><p>"I  just told you the idea. Quit."</p><p>"Sugar,  there's no way in hell we're just gonna step aside and  let your sister have him because you say so."</p><p>"No,  listen," Nabiki tried again. "I mean all of you should quit.   If you all agree to drop your claims then the problem evaporates  and Ranma can live."</p><p>"And  where does that leave us?" Akane demanded.</p><p>"It  leaves you exactly where you were yesterday, minus Kodachi  and all the pressure of the engagements. I'm not saying you  have to stop pursuing Ranma, just that you drop the official bonds."</p><p>"That  no solve anything!" Shampoo complained.</p><p>"Wrong,  it solves the problem immediately at hand. Nobody can  win if the prize is dead, after all." The room fell silent for  a moment as the finality of the problem sunk in.</p><p>"I'm  in," Akane stated, first to respond. "It's really all we've  got."</p><p>"Typical,  Sugar," Ukyo snidely commented. "You've spent the last  two years screaming that you didn't want to be engaged anyway,  so it's no loss to you. Of course, it helps that you're also  right this time... I'm in, but only if Shampoo is too."</p><p>"Shampoo...  no can agree," the Amazon replied, averting her eyes.</p><p>"Damn  it Shampoo!" Akane grabbed the girl's shoulder and spun  her around.</p><p>"Is  law problem... Shampoo can no quit right now."</p><p>Ukyo  snorted. "You mean your Kuno problem, right?"</p><p>"Stupid  Mousse," the girl mumbled, "Need learn to keep mouth shut.   Shampoo teach him too too good when get home."</p><p>"If  she quits on Ranma then she has to marry Kuno," Ukyo explained  for the others. "Apparently he somehow beat her, and until  Ranma and Kuno settle things the law is up in the air for her.   Hence the match last week."</p><p>"Glad  I'm not an Amazon..." Akane added, earning a glare from  her sister.</p><p>Nabiki  honestly felt sorry for the girl, but there was too much  at stake to let that sway her now. Besides, it was her own dumb  laws to blame; the same ones that had made her a constant thorn  in Ranma's side for quite a while now.</p><p>"Let's  examine it, then: If you quit, you have to marry Kuno.   If you don't quit then Ranma dies because we've obviously got  nothing else to try. If Ranma dies, what happens to you and Kuno?"</p><p>"He  be only Airen then," Shampoo sniffed, sadly, "and Shampoo  must accept him at least until have first child."</p><p>"So  either way you end up with Kuno, really, and you still have  a way out after a while," Nabiki summarized. "That doesn't matter  at all then. The question is just whether you want Ranma to  live or die today."</p><p>"Please,  Shampoo," Akane begged.</p><p>Ukyo  took the girl's other shoulder in a comforting posture. "It's  the only thing you can do, Sugar."</p><p>"Shampoo..."  she began, then choked on a sob. "Shampoo agree."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>It's  funny how sometimes things just all fall into place at the  same time, despite thousands of attempts beforehand to accomplish  just the same goal. Perhaps there is some sort of divine  schedule to which all important events must align, regardless  of the intents of frustrated humans to speed things along.   A time for all things, as it were.</p><p>Ranma  didn't find his current situation funny. Not at all. In  fact, it rather pissed him off.</p><p>He'd  been trying for over an hour to come up with some sort of  lasting message to leave behind, something profound and beautiful  to serve as his final summation on the experience of living.   For a while he experimented with various themes of natural  occurrences, trying to create some eloquent metaphor for his  valiant struggles. Then he tried to capture some moment of particular  wisdom in eloquent verse. Towards the end he was desperate  enough to abandon any attempt at good writing and just fit  in some touching personal message to his loved ones. Of course,  none of these efforts worked out.</p><p>When  the sun struck his face he sighed and went down to meet his  fate with all the boldness he could muster. He really didn't want  to die yet, but it seemed his clever plan had failed... not that  he had ever had that great a record with such schemes, he admitted.   He had been so sure at least one of them would pass his  test that he never really gave a serious thought to failure until  he talked with Nabiki and learned how selfishly his fiancée's  arguments had developed.</p><p>Taking  a seat in the prepared area for his death, Ranma once again  lifted his brush. Out of time, he simply wrote about the first  thing that came to mind: blame.</p><p>My  test has ended:<br/>If  love is just a trophy,<br/>Then  I prefer death.</p><p>It  wasn't a very good way to go, he knew, with such a sour goodbye.   It certainly wasn't like the Saotome Ranma people would remember,  but then the cheerful young man they knew hadn't been sentenced  to death by the uncaring whims of others. "Well to hell  with them," he decided. "It's my seppuku and I'll bitch if I  want to."</p><p>Unless  of course his whining was derailed by a completely out-of-the-blue  interruption, like someone (who should have been inside  doing her damned job...) screaming "Pantyhose!" for no particular  reason. Well,  okay, so maybe she was just trying to warn him that one  of his less frequent annoyances was dropping by for a visit. It  still didn't explain why Nabiki, or the rest of the girls for that  matter, hadn't at least come down to see him off. Downright rude  in fact.</p><p>"Somethin'  ya need, Pantyhose?" he asked, dropping the brush to  the side and cocking his head. "Better make it quick; I don't have  much time."</p><p>The  beast stepped forward threateningly, then doused itself with  presumably hot water from one of two flasks tied to its waist  with its namesake fabric. Where the rest of his clothing came  from was a question Ranma chose not ponder. "Kodachi  asked me to come here and kick your butt, Fem-boy," he  smirked. "How could I refuse such a request? Get up already."</p><p>"I'm  kinda busy at the moment," Ranma gestured to his katana-wielding  mother, "What with killing myself and all. Think we can put  this one off until my next life?"</p><p>"I  made a promise, Hermaphrodite. You remember what those are,  don't you?" The foreign young man goaded. "Guess I could just  desecrate your corpse a bit, but that's kinda beneath me."</p><p>"You  know, it occurs to me that we've never actually had a one-on-one  fight before, Panty-ho," Ranma replied while taking off  his shirt. "I think I'd regret dying without clearing that up  first."</p><p>"Huh,  huh. Your funeral either way." The stocking-clad man hopped  back a few paces back before taking up a combat stance with  a very high guard. "Bring it, bitch."</p><p>Ranma  charged, leading off with a jumping right cross. His opponent  pivoted to the side in response, fending off the blow with  both forearms while striking with a quick knee. Ranma absorbed  the impact with his thigh, but was pushed away when the blow  became a thrusting kick.</p><p>Taro  immediately hopped forward, kicking out at his prey with  the same right leg. Ranma ducked the attack and rolled out of  the way of the follow-up axeheel.</p><p>"I  see you did more that just splash around in the springs since  I last saw ya, Pantyhose. Take a trip through Thailand, perhaps?"  Ranma asked with a knowing smile.</p><p>"No,  but I did study a little Muy Thai under a pit fighter in  Hong Kong. Don't want to become too dependant on the curse, at  least for dealing with lightweights like you."</p><p>"Oh  really? Try this on for size then, ya nylon nutjob!" Ranma  charged in again, this time with a flying roundhouse. As expected,  his foe countered with another lunging kick, which he twisted  around with a strong motion from the waist. He landed in a  crouch beneath the strike, and took the opportunity to punch the  weight-bearing knee presented to him.</p><p>Taro  bent the joint to avoid serious harm, falling towards Ranma  with an elbow drop. The shirtless boy rolled aside, narrowly  avoiding the strike. He managed to regain his footing almost  immediately though, and took the opportunity to kick his target  in the ribs as he righted himself.</p><p>"That  feel like a lightweight did it, Panty-boy?" Ranma grinned,  hoping lightly. This was exactly the kind of memory he wanted  to leave behind; an exhilarating fight, not some silly string  of words.</p><p>"Cheap  shot, Saotome," Taro replied as he resumed his stance,  his guard a bit lower this time. "Lucky for me you still kick  like a little girl. Here, let me show you how a kick is supposed  to feel!"</p><p>Pantyhose  lunged as if to go for another straight-legged thrust,  but instead merely hopped forward, continuing to twist as he  landed to deliver a spinning heel kick to Ranma's side with the  other leg, ending in a crouching position.</p><p>Ranma managed to block  the attack with his arm tight against his side, but the impact  still caused him to stumble a few steps sideways. He  retaliated with a snap kick at his opponent's face that was  easily deflected, but it served the purpose of keeping his foe  defensive while he waited out the sudden numbness in his limb.   There was a lot more force behind those kicks then he expected!</p><p>Fighting  the urge to shake his arm, Ranma pressed in while his  target was still slightly out of position. He unleashed a flurry  of punches, forcing Taro to backpedal as he blocked and staying  in close enough to prevent any more of those kicks from landing  with any significant power.</p><p>The  retreating combatant managed to reestablish some tempo by  leaning away from one punch while throwing a knee at Ranma's crotch.   The blow missed by a good margin, but the distraction broke  Ranma's timing enough for Taro to halt his flight and throw a  few quick jabs of his own.</p><p>Ranma  slowed his attacks and blocks slightly, waiting for the  right moment. At last his opponent launched a straight punch at  his chin while his other arm was busy deflecting one of Ranma's  off-hand strikes. Ranma deflected the strike from the outside  while pivoting around the blow, then grabbed the outstretched  arm with his left and stepped forward, delivering a crushing  elbow to the bridge of his target's nose.</p><p>Hearing a distinctive crack, he released the held limb  and ducked a wild swing from the other. As his target staggered  back, wiping at the tears that such a blow reflexively caused,  Ranma charged in low and delivered a salvo of Amaguriken punches  to Taro's exposed gut. He finished the assault with a leg  sweep as he dodged a feeble downward elbow attempt.</p><p>"Yuu  furkin' hunt!" the wounded boy yelled as he rolled to his  feet, holding his nose as it dripped a thick stream of blood. "I'll  hill you fur thot!" His other hand shot to his belt, pulling  free a second canister and holding it above his head.</p><p>"Cut  him down now while you still can," that oh-so-familiar voice  suggested. "Let loose on this beast to save the ones you care  about"</p><p>No,  he was going to win this fight legitimately and with as little  special technique as possible. Sure it would be easy to let  loose another vacuum blade and take of the idiot's head, but it  would hardly be a fitting end to his career as a martial artist.   He was going to win this fight, but not that way.</p><p>Ranma  grinned darkly, then bolted forward while charging both  hands with reddish-orange chi. He leapt upwards as he neared  his opponent, traveling upwards fractionally slower than Taro  gained height. He pivoted back to avoid a deadly swipe from the  venom-barbed tentacles of his foe's newest form, pointing his hands  towards the ground as he pivoted. With  a blast of angry chi he gained tremendous speed just as the  monster's transformation finished, landing a vicious double-knee  blow to the base of the beast's unarmored chin. The hulking form  was rocketed skywards, falling flatly on its back with a dull  thud.</p><p>Ranma  wasted no time leaping once again at the fallen titan, landing  in a kneeling position on its armored chest. "Lights out,  Pantyhose," he snarled in the bleary-eyed face of his opponent  as he jabbed each of his hands into the ground astride his  bovine head. Twin eruptions of rock and soil blasted the beast's  head, leaving it finally to lull into unconsciousness.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Genma  watched with pride as his son took his opponent apart piece  by piece, just as he was taught; test your foe, counter his strengths,  then press your advantage on to victory. Not that the young  man looked like much of a challenge, at least in his natural  form. Hopefully Ranma would take him out before that became  a problem... the house just finished being repaired, after all.</p><p>Not  that it was his house to protect, though. Nodoka had made  it painfully clear, in deed if not in word, that he was only tolerated  here, not welcome. Perhaps it was unreasonable to expect  things to be as they were whenever he finally got around to  returning... hell, who was he kidding? Of course it was. When  he left he hadn't actually planned to return at all, so that hadn't  really been a concern.</p><p>The  years on the road had been exciting, just like reliving his  own childhood training with own father. At least until the war,  of course... and after that it was never an option. He narrowly  avoided contemplating the master's training in any depth,  catching himself as the day he and Soun met the old bastard  tried to sneak into mind. If not for Ranma's existence he  would have judged the remainder of his life a waste, and he ruefully  admitted he owed the fallen pervert that little bit of acknowledgement;  he'd have never met Nodoka without his assistance'.</p><p>For  a moment his heart leapt into his throat as the over-classed  boy prepared to transform. Seeing the slight grin on Ranma's  face eased any concerns, however... the boy never could hide  it when he had a clever idea in mind. "Too honest for his own  good sometimes," he grumbled aloud, though he knew deep down that  his greatest joy was seeing Ranma's face light up with the joy  of the art. Well, that and smacking him into the pond when he  gets too predictable, of course.</p><p>With  careless ease the young man in question hopped off the beast's  chest, casually brushing stray bits of debris from his arms.   Besides a few scratches on these limbs and the occasional grass  stain, he looked unharmed. "Heh, piece a cake," he smirked as  Genma made his way towards the victor.</p><p>"You're  lucky you didn't kill him with that last stunt, Boy,"  he grumbled, tossing a cup of warm water on the defeated warrior,  "especially after breaking his nose. Just plain sloppy."   Wouldn't do for the boy to get a big head about such an easy  win.</p><p>"It  was a solid blow ta the chin, Pop, and nothin' more. Not  the first time I took this punk out with a good shot there."</p><p>"Still,  you should have been more careful. A martial artist must  always strive to protect the weak, even if they happen to be your  opponent at the time," Genma pronounced, quoting some material  he had long ago committed to memory without thinking too hard  about. At least this one sounded right when he said it.</p><p>"Yeah,  well, lucky for him I remembered that I'm the only one  supposed ta die this morning," Ranma replied sourly. "Now that  the fight's done let's get this over with fore I lose my nerve."</p><p>That  chill ran down his spine again... the one that always seemed  to come when Nodoka unsheathed that damned sword. Why had the  boy done something as stupid as giving her any reason to take it  back off the shelf?</p><p>"Boy,"  he began, placing a hand on his son's bare shoulder. "Ranma,  please think this over. If you want out of your engagements  this badly then I'll take back the promises, honor be damned.   I'm sure Soun will understand, but even if he doesn't I'd  rather keep my son than his friendship." Not that it really mattered  at this point anyway... Soun would be pissed at how this played  out now regardless. He'd get over it eventually though, Genma  hoped.</p><p>"Pop,  that's probably the nicest thing you've ever said ta me,"  Ranma whispered, "and it really means a lot ta hear ya say it.   But I've gotta do this, not just for me or you, or even the Tendos;  If I don't deal with this then it'll dishonor our whole family,  from the earliest antecessors to any future generations we  might have. I won't let that happen to them, or ta Mom."</p><p>Plan  C it is then: take all the responsibility away from the kid  and make a break for it. "Then let me take responsibility for  it all, son. I've been thinking about it all night, and when it  comes down to it this really is all my fault."</p><p>"Who  are you and what have ya done with Saotome Genma?" Ranma  snapped, gripping his father's lapels.</p><p>"What,  you doubt your father's sincerity?" he replied, doing his  best puffed-chest imitation of pride.</p><p>"No,  but I doubt you takin' alla the blame this time. I'm the  one who promised Ucchan I'd watch over her forever. I'm the one  who challenged Shampoo. I'm the one who pretty much accepted Akane's  claim when we switched it back from Nabiki. I'm sorry Pop,  but this is something I gotta do."</p><p>"No  you don't!"</p><p>Both  Saotomes wheeled around to find Nabiki and the fiancées entering  the yard, the moderator with a very purposeful pace. As Nabiki  approached she pounced on Ranma, hugging him excitedly in what  seemed like her best attempt to make Shampoo's efforts seem lacking.   No denying it, the boy just had the touch when it came to  women, whether he wanted it or not.</p><p>"Um,  you wanna explain that, Nabiki?" Ranma asked, apparently  trying to escape her grasp with some semblance of calm.</p><p>"We  solved the problem, Ranma! There are no more contradictions  against your honor now!" she explained excitedly, though  with less affection this time.</p><p>Ranma  stumbled back a step and collapsed into a sitting position,  stunned. "You really did it? Wow, I thought for sure I  was a goner. So, uh, who's the lucky girl?"</p><p>None  of the girls were forthcoming, but Shampoo didn't even seem  to be paying attention. Must be pretty tired, Genma guessed,  glad he snuck in a reasonable amount of rest.</p><p>"Well,  that's pretty much up to you to decide again, Ranma," Nabiki  began.</p><p>"What!"  Ranma interrupted. "Damn it, I told you that I won't  make a choice and I meant it. It's up to you three to figure  it out. Look, I appreciate the effort but I'm not backing out  of this. That's the way it has to be!"</p><p>"Calm  down, Ranma, geez," Nabiki complained. "What I mean to  say is that we really did get rid of all the problems. You don't  -have- to choose, but it's your choice again."</p><p>"You're  not making a whole lot of sense, you know that?" the  narrowly pardoned young man retorted defensively.</p><p>"You  aren't engaged anymore, to anybody," Nabiki clarified. "I  got them to agree to all drop their official claims so that you  could live and none of them would lose... well, most of them wouldn't  anyway."</p><p>"You  mean... you all," Ranma paused, gripping his forehead. "Not  even one of you was willing to give up unless the others all did  too!"</p><p>Genma  boggled for a moment... what did it matter why he was free?   Stupid boy can't even take the gift of life without thinking  there's some catch. The catch doesn't matter if you leave  before they can tell you what it is!</p><p>"Of  course we didn't, Ranchan... We all love you too much!" Ukyo  pleaded.</p><p>"No,  Ukyo, you don't. None of you do," Ranma stated bluntly.   "That was the whole damned point of this test, and you all  failed miserably."</p><p>"How  can you say that you jerk?" Akane demanded. "This was some  sicko game of yours? Some kind of psychotic stress test?"</p><p>"You  ever heard the saying if you love something, let it go...'?   It's really simple," Ranma snapped. "I was trying to see  which of you would give up first, would sacrifice their own happiness  for my sake. None of you made it."</p><p>"You...  used me," Nabiki whispered.</p><p>"I'm  real glad you all came to this decision, though you sure  took your sweet time about it," Ranma continued. "It would have  been a damned shame if I had to die over nothing."</p><p>"Nothing?"  Shampoo snarled tearfully. "You say Shampoo love nothing?   Shampoo lose so much for you love; honor as tribe champion,  body to springs, pride to stupid country, and now must give  first time sex to stick-boy! Shampoo too too good for Ranma!"   She finished the tirade by belting him across the face, then  ran away as he crumpled into the dirt.</p><p>Ukyo  dropped to a knee next to him and helped him sit up. "You  gambled your life and all our feelings on some silly cliche? You  really are a jackass, Ranma." She slapped the boy hard across  the cheek and walked calmly away.</p><p>Akane  took the opportunity to stomp on his crotch, call him a  "stupid, arrogant bastard", and likewise leave in a huff. Nabiki  followed after her, though she stopped to look back over her  shoulder before leaving the yard.</p><p>This  last departure made Genma pause. He'd never before seen  young Nabiki with that particular look on her face before, but  he doubted it was a good thing. Had the boy finally managed to  not just annoy her, but fully piss her off?</p><p>"Perhaps  you should leave the decisions regarding honor to me  from now on, boy," Genma suggested, hopefully.</p><p>Nodoka  smiled enigmatically and shook her head, saying nothing.</p><p><b>Author's  Notes:</b></p><p>Yeah...  quite a delay since last update, huh?</p><p>Truth  is I had this chapter's first draft almost done when the  last one was posted. Unfortunately, fate intervened in the form  of the evil that is windows service pack 2. Some kind of crazy  noncompliance error locked my system down into a nasty reboot  loop that even safe mode, refresh to last known config, or hours  on the phone with some random Hindu techs couldn't get it out  of. The solution ended up being a full sweep and reload, resulting  in me losing everything I had done. After having to download  my own work from other people's servers just to have a copy  I found it really hard to get any kind of motivation to work on  this for any length of time.</p><p>So  no, I wasn't intentionally trying to screw with you over with  the cliffhanger ending from last time. Sorry about that.</p><p>Secondly,  thanks for the suggestions, Max. I went back through  all the previous chapters and tried to clean up all the stuff  you mentioned. Better?</p><p>This  chapter was originally going to be all in the last chapter,  but it obviously got too long. I was thinking of adding two  or three more scenes to this one, but what is here is enough to  cross my self-imposed 10,000-word minimum, and in the end I decided  they fit better as the start of the next act, "Rhythm of the  Flames."</p><p>Finally,  here's the part where I pontificate for a while about the subtle  nature of the act title. Yes, I know it's pretentious as hell but it  became a sort of tradition along the way, so there you have it.  Don't like it? Then don't read it.</p><p>The  original name of this act was "The Paradox of Free Will", but  discussions with reviewer Obsidian-Fox convinced me that the argument  upon which this name was based was fatally flawed.</p><p>The  new title for this act still captures the same general point; that  the primary thematic theme of this act was to tie up (or at least  make preparations to tie up) several of the lingering conflicts from  the original manga. A deck of fate, also known as the tarot,  symbolizes the various situations of the characters from the manga  and the earlier chapters, all of which have led up to Ranma's  challenge this chapter.</p><p>The  deck has been shuffled for two reasons: first, the old story arcs are  now mostly over, making room for the new stuff to begin. Secondly,  the shuffling also refers to the way in which the standard shipped  relationships have been twisted around to allow some much less common  pairings... mostly just because I want to play around with some new  dimensions of character outside of the typical portrayals.</p><p>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #4 (Recently demoted for slacking off... sigh)</p><p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered!
