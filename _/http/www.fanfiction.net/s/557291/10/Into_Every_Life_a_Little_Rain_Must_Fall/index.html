</div><p><b>Into  Every Life, a Little Rain Must Fall<br/></b>A  Ranma 1/2 (manga) fanfic by NemesisZero</p><p><b>Act  4: A Rhythm in the Flames<br/></b>Part  1</p><p><b>Pre-readers:</b><br/>Aondehafka<br/>Robert</p><p><b>Recap  of Last Chapter:</b></p><p>Ranma  unveiled his plan to solve the fiancée dilemma once and for  all by declaring that he really couldn't make an honorable choice.  Therefore it was the girls' problem, not his. Several people  disagreed with this notion, but he went even further, declaring that  the situation would end this night... either by the fiancées  choosing one among themselves or his seppuku at dawn!</p><p>While  the girls went upstairs to talk, Ranma found time to make a deal with  Ryoga that regardless of the outcome neither would interfere with  the other's attempts to win Akane. He talked with Cologne about  his dreams, which set her off on a quest for information. Finally,  Ryu came back from his spar with Mousse in time for a quick  demonstration of the forbidden Umisenken stealth technique... against  the advice of both Genma and Cologne.</p><p>The  girls tried everything they could come up with to settle the issue,  but dawn came before an answer did. Taro's sudden appearance on  behalf of the jilted Kodachi bought some time, though. Nabiki spent  it wisely, finally convincing the fiancées to all give up  their claims so that Ranma could live and they would essentially all  be on the same footing anyway (well, except for Shampoo due to  another complication). The fiancées rushed downstairs with  the good news just as Ranma managed to take down his monstrous foe,  the first time he'd ever done so without help.</p><p>Things  quickly turned sour from there as Ranma revealed the whole idea was a  test (based on the old "if you love something, let it go..."  cliché)... and one they had all failed by refusing to quit  individually. The girls made their displeasure plainly known, and  nobody left happy. Even the majority of the Saotome family was still  rather annoyed at the whole situation Ranma had put them through.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>He  awoke suddenly, the effect of being shoved casually aside by his new  wife. At least there wasn't any real malice behind it... a  definite improvement over Shampoo. Rather than rise he chose to stay  in the dirt where he lay for the moment, gazing up at her as he  stretched across the hard ground, working out some residual soreness  from his sparring session with Ryu. "Good morning, Ukyo," he  offered blandly as a greeting to the brownish-haired blur.</p><p>She  paused in fumbling tiredly with the keys to look his way, then closed  her eyes and sighed. "Mousse, can't whatever you want wait till  later? I'm dead on my feet here."</p><p>"I  don't mean to keep you up long but, um, I'm kinda still unwelcome  at the restaurant and all..." he hinted, while feeling around for  his glasses.</p><p>"...And  you figured that for some reason I'd let you sleep here," she  finished the thought. She turned away and finished unlocking the  door, stepped in, but paused in the doorway. "I know I'm gonna  regret asking this, but why exactly did you think I'd go for this  idea?"</p><p>The  first answer to spring to mind was 'Because you're my wife',  but his memories of the previous morning told him that was likely to  just piss her off. "...Because you're, um, such a generous  person?" the Amazon finally hazarded.</p><p>With  a noncommittal grunt the chef continued walking into the dark store,  leaving the door open behind her.</p><p>After  finally finding his lenses again, Mousse got up and brushed himself  off. He then peered inside the store, unsure of how to take the  non-answer. "Um, hello?" he called after her into the mostly  unlit space, unsure of where she had gotten off to. Still not  receiving an answer, he stumbled in curiously, shutting the door  behind him.</p><p>He  headed towards the back room, where the sounds of light slumber could  be heard emanating from the supply closet; the ninja, he guessed.  Finding the door closed, Mousse chose instead to head upstairs to  Ukyo's room, presumably where she wandered off to.</p><p>Her  door was ajar. He knocked lightly on the frame, but still received  no answer. The Amazon took a deep breath then pushed aside the  barrier, half expecting to be kicked in the face at any moment.</p><p>"You've  got some real balls coming into my room like this, Mousse. I'll  give you that much credit." Ukyo was apparently already in bed,  her kimono left carelessly on the floor in a heap.</p><p>"You,  um, never really answered my question back there..." he mumbled in  explanation. Had her attitude towards him changed back to  affectionate by the evening's events? Was she wearing anything  under those sheets?</p><p>"I  didn't say no, if that's what you're getting at," she  replied, "but I didn't invite you in either, so don't expect  much in the way of hospitality."</p><p>"I  guess I understand," the Amazon answered, then began to disrobe.</p><p>"Oh  for Kami's sake!" she half growled, turning to face away from  him. "Look, you can stay the night but there's no way in hell  I'm sleeping with you again, jackass. Bah, Amazons..."</p><p>"But  I thought maybe..."</p><p>"The  spare futon's in the closet by the bathroom," she explained. "Go  find some open floor and set yourself up. I'm too tired to play  hostess."</p><p>Mousse  walked towards the indicated door, but paused to gather up her  discarded robe. If he was headed to the closet anyway, he decided,  he might as well do her a favor and put it up. The formal garment  looked like it was meant to folded up in some fashion, but being  unfamiliar with it he chose to just hang it up on a wire hanger.  Better than the floor, at least.</p><p>Behind  rows of her typical market clothes and a pair of male school uniforms  he found the tightly rolled bedding mat she had spoken of. The young  man took a few steps towards the door before some twinge of pride and  rebelliousness caused him to pause. Without further ado he dropped  the mat next to her larger western-style bed and unrolled it where  the kimono had been moments before.</p><p>"What  exactly are you doing?" the chef groaned, rolling back over to  glare at him.</p><p>"You  said to find some open floor... this spot looks pretty open to me,  right?" he replied without meeting her gaze directly.</p><p>"Argh...  fine, whatever," she snapped, lying back down in a huff.</p><p>The  Amazon grinned at his small victory, safe in the relative darkness of  the room.</p><p>"...but  if you try anything funny, and I do mean anything, I promise that no  amount of hot water will be able to make you a man again. You got  that?"</p><p>His  grin died a horrible death and his throat went dry. With a gulp, he  returned an affirmative "Yeah, uh, no problem."</p><p>"Well,  good night then."</p><p>"Uh...  good morning, actually."</p><p>"Mousse?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Shut  up."</p><p>So  this was married life; going to sleep on the floor with only a cheap,  lumpy, itchy, thinly padded mat to call your own... while his wife,  for all of a whole day now, claimed the soft, inviting mattress and  its thick covers all to herself. Tossing and turning, struggling in  vain to find a comfortable way to sleep on this potato sack of a bed,  Mousse had to wonder just what the hell it was that made people want  this life.</p><p>Oh  yeah... sex without having to do all the usual annoying date stuff.</p><p>But  then it seemed that the rumors were true on that account... their sex  life had quickly gone downhill after marriage, just like all the old  men back in the village used to joke about. Kind of depressing in a  way, he decided... one decent night he only really half remembered,  and in payment the rest of his life was hers. Still, at least she  was treating him better than Shampoo usually did.</p><p>He  felt a wave of homesickness though, wishing he were back in that  idealistic world back in China before he'd ever heard of Ranma. A  place where he was free to sample the wares of any village girl who  would have him... Well, to be honest the three that had invited him  to 'explore their mysteries' weren't exactly prizes. Ban Shi  was incredibly annoying whenever she opened her mouth, Haru Pi kept  nagging him, and Bao Reng, with her calm, patient manner, just wasn't  exciting enough for him.</p><p>All  three publicly scorned him when he left the village for Japan,  jealous no doubt of his ongoing attention to Shampoo. He remembered  it was rather an odd feeling, to be rejected by people he had known  so well and yet really didn't care all that much for. On the one  hand he didn't really care, as he had already rejected them, but  still the fact that they were so strongly set against him had left  Mousse with a certain degree of hurt anyway.</p><p>He  decided that was probably the reason for Ukyo's attitude lately.  She couldn't help feeling a little bad that, whatever had  transpired after he left, she didn't come home with Saotome in tow.   Sure the chef had openly rejected her former fiancé by  marrying him (even Saotome wasn't quite that clueless... probably),  but there might be some residual feelings there to work out still.  Mousse just needed to be patient and stay available... eventually  she'd get over it and adjust to their new life.</p><p>Unless  of course she really didn't want to be married...</p><p>"Mousse?"</p><p>"Uh,  yes?" he replied, caught off guard by the unexpected intrusion on  his inner monologue.</p><p>"Would  you please stop rolling around down there and muttering to  yourself? You're keeping me up and kinda creeping me out at the  same time."</p><p>An  opportunity? "Sorry, it's just that I'm kind of uncomfortable  down here. Saotome's cousin gave me a hell of a workout... I'm  not sure he fully understands the concept of sparring." At least  he sure hoped that he wasn't holding back.</p><p>A  pillow rained down on him from above, striking with unnecessary  force.</p><p>"I  was just wondering, if, you know, I could maybe come up there  instead?" he queried cautiously.</p><p>"Gee,  I wonder what the world speed record is for a radical castration with  a kitchen utensil?" she replied with less hesitation. "I'm  sure I can beat my old record..."</p><p>He  wisely concluded talks for the time being.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>She  awoke with a start and glanced to the clock, then cursed her weakness  for falling asleep. Under normal circumstances she could remain  active almost indefinitely, should the circumstances require her  attentions. Certainly this was one such instance, perhaps the most  daunting challenge she had faced since becoming matriarch, and here  she was nodding off while reading the ancient history of her people  like a common undisciplined girl. In truth she was quite lucky to be  alive, but that would hardly matter in the long run if what she  suspected came to pass.</p><p>Then  again this was all moot if the boy's so-called plan failed to work  out. Regardless of the outcome she had been planning on attending,  but the sun was already fully above the horizon. The sound of rapid  impacts from the back lot told her just where to go to ask, however,  and eliminated one of the possible outcomes. Unsure of how she  personally felt about that new information, the elder proceeded  downstairs to see to her heir, who surely wasn't in the best of  moods regardless of which of the other outcomes had come to fruition.</p><p>The  scene playing out before her left her somewhat confused, however.  The makeshift training equipment they had created from scrap metal,  wood, and other items was now little more that so much debris spread  across the yard. It was for precisely this reason that the Amazons  never paid for 'quality' training gear, but some of these were  fairly new and should have lasted much longer than they had...  especially the iron drum they found last week and filled with rocks,  now lying on its side and split in twain under the force of repeated  thunderous blows. At the center of the mess Shampoo continued to  bash the pile, using overhand swings of one of her bonbori with  nothing resembling training or skill.</p><p>"Enough!"  the elder shouted forcefully in her native tongue, throwing off the  girl in mid swing. Shampoo's grip slipped at the impact and the  bludgeoning implement's handle slipped free, rebounding with the  blow to smack into her forehead and topple her gracelessly into the  dirt. She declined to react to the pain, choosing instead to growl  in frustration and kick the misshapen drum.</p><p>"Child,  this tantrum is not worthy of you and is doing your training no good  at all." Cologne scolded as she approached the petulant young  warrior, then sighed. In a softer voice she asked, "I take it the  evening's outcome was... not to your liking?"</p><p>"Not  to anyone's liking," the girl admitted with a scowl as she sat  up. "Ranma is a damned fool."</p><p>"Most  men are, dear," she replied with a forced smile, trying to ignore  the particular wording her young apprentice had chosen, "...and  Ranma more than most others."</p><p>Shampoo  laughed, but not in humor. "He said it was all just a test, a game  to see which of us gave up first. He intended to marry the one who  showed she loved him least!"</p><p>"Quite  foolish indeed," she agreed, though certain there was more to it  than this simple explanation. "So who quit first then? Akane?"</p><p>"No  one quit first, Great-Grandmother. We argued until dawn without  getting anywhere."</p><p>"So...  he's dead then?" Cologne hazarded, though suspecting it much more  likely that he simply ran away when faced with his mortality, as he  had several times before. The boy was hardly the bravest she'd  known, though to his credit he usually found his nerve whenever  others were in real danger.</p><p>"No,  not dead yet," Shampoo replied ruefully. "We didn't want him  to die, not like that. The greedy Tendo suggested we all give up to  save him, and... I agreed. We all did." Shampoo punched the  ground angrily before continuing, "And that stupid bastard was  -angry- that we let him live! He said that we all failed his stupid  test, that we somehow proved we didn't love him!"</p><p>The  elder grimaced and shook her head, astounded at the folly of youth.  If the boy was still alive, however, she hadn't the time to waste  counseling her ward in her latest romantic setback. "I share your  feelings, child, but there is something I have to take care of. You  and Mu Tzu will remain here long enough to pack whatever of our  belongings you wish to keep and to sell this property." She paused  and looked around, then asked, "Where is that loafer anyway? I  have instructions for him as well."</p><p>"He  hasn't been here for a few days." Shampoo replied neutrally.</p><p>The  old woman's interest was piqued. "Gone, that lovesick fool? How  hard did you hit him?"</p><p>"I  didn't hit him," she explained. "Well, not recently, anyway.  He went out a couple of days ago and hasn't been back since."</p><p>"Yet  I saw him at Ranma's mother's house the other evening," the  matriarch snapped. "If he is well he should be here, which makes  me wonder what you did to him to drive him off again."</p><p>"I  didn't beat him up again, if that's what you're asking,"  Shampoo sniffed defensively.</p><p>"But  you did do something, didn't you."</p><p>"I  just used him to show Kuno how the curses work," Shampoo replied.</p><p>"You  humiliated him before someone he views as a rival." Cologne sighed,  rubbing her temples. "So I can only assume he's plotting some  sort of revenge on the boy now. Why weren't you keeping tabs on  him? Who knows what kind of madness he's planning..."</p><p>"My  new..." Shampoo grimaced, "husband... is better than him anyway,  so who cares?"</p><p>"You  really should have more respect for his skills, child. You don't  give him nearly enough credit."</p><p>"But  he's a male! He shouldn't have those skills in the first place!"</p><p>"This  is an old argument, and one I don't have time for at the moment. I  expect you to bring both Mu Tzu and your husband back to the village  with you. Finding them and keeping them from killing each other is  your problem."</p><p>Shampoo  blinked. "But... why so soon? Why the rush?"</p><p>"If  my suspicions are correct, and I pray they are not, Ranma may be  under the influence of a dark spirit... The Pale One."</p><p>The  younger Amazon recoiled as if struck. "But... But that's just a  myth, a story to frighten the children," she whispered, then turned  a hopeful glance at the elder. "Isn't it?"</p><p>"You  fought the Phoenix King, did you not? If that part of the tale is  true why should I not assume this one is as well? Surely you noticed  his curse reacted unusually last night, sensed the change in his  behavior, and felt the hunger of that black aura..." Cologne  turned to look at the sky, sighing. "Child, he's seen the demon  in his dreams, even spoken with it."</p><p>"Will  you kill him?" Shampoo asked flatly.</p><p>Cologne  turned back to her great-granddaughter, but could not gauge whether  the girl actually wanted that outcome or not. "It may very well be  the easiest answer, I admit. If I can get him back to the village  perhaps the other elders and I will find a way to save him in the  scrolls of record. But if not..." The sentence need not be  completed. "And even if I do, there is no guarantee that the  damnable fiend won't just pick another host. I don't have the  answer at this point."</p><p>Shampoo  stood up, dusting herself off quickly as she rose, and turned away.  "I understand. I will handle everything here."</p><p>"Xian  Pu..."</p><p>"Just  go!" Shampoo yelled, then added in a lower tone, "Please, Great  Grandmother... just go. I will do as you asked."</p><p>"Very  well," she replied, then bounded to the rooftops. For her  student's sake she would give the less fatal approach a try, for  now.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>He  stood on the edge of a solid rock ledge, gazing down from on high at  the indistinct landscape below. The forest, once alluring and  fearsome, stood no more; a charred and blackened space ravaged by  recent fire filled its place while the scent of smoke still clung to  him, thick and heavy. The once gentle green hills were pale and  frozen beneath a blanket of ice crystals, each drift edge gleaming  like razors in the shifting moonlight. Looking beyond these  immediate landscapes revealed only an endless bank of cold grey fog  which seemed to melt into the clouds above to form a subtle, but  effective, barrier to his perceptions. The whole of the landscape  was still and dead, save for a slight chill breeze and the distant  roll of thunder.</p><p>Ranma  wasn't really taking in these details, however. He was far more  concerned with getting the timing right so that when the figure he  expected to appear behind him any second now decided to drop in, his  attack would catch him by surprise. There, the skin on the back of  his neck prickled with a faint static charge; immediately he threw  himself backwards with his full strength, twisting in mid air to snap  his leg at a height just above his own face. He growled in annoyance  as his blow only succeeded in dissipating a patch of dark fog.</p><p>"Still  feeling a bit aggressive, are we?" a monotone voice asked from  higher up the cliffs.</p><p>"Didn't  I tell ya I didn't wanna see you again?" The young man snapped.  "Why can't ya get it through your head that I don't give a damn  about whatever you wanna tell me?"</p><p>"And  why are you so unable to listen to a few simple words? What are you  afraid of?" the dark figure returned, merely standing on the ledge  in a natural posture, his hands hidden beneath the shifting  multi-hued robes. "I only wish to talk."</p><p>"Yeah?   Well that's just tough," Ranma muttered as he leapt upward,  propelling himself ever higher as he kicked against the nearly sheer  surface of the cliffs to reach the next ledge, briefly losing sight  of his quarry. He tensed his arms tight against his chest until just  clearing the ledge, then flung them wide to release a large vacuum  blade. He landed lightly on the stone shelf and glanced around as  the wave bit a hollow gash into the face, his prey absent.</p><p>"First  fear, now anger... which emotion will you hide behind next, I  wonder?" asked Norou without amusement from somewhere below. "Will  you try to drown out my words with the sound of your tears?"</p><p>"You  could only dream, pal!" Ranma growled, peering over the edge to  spot his foe standing where he had been moments before. With a smirk  he spread his fingers wide and released spikes of angry red chi, each  of the ten rays resulting in a bakusai tenketsu explosion on contact  with the raw stone. He then used the forbidden kijin raishü  dan technique again to sheer off the platform of stone he now perched  on, ridding the block down the already crumbling surface to the lower  level as both a sled and a weapon.</p><p>He  stood ready, senses at full alert, as the debris and dust settled  around him. Yet again it seemed the interloper had evaded his  attempt to close and fight. He quickly glanced around, both above  and below his current station, but made no move yet in either  direction.</p><p>"You  must realize this is pointless by now." The pale man spoke softly,  his words riding the faint breeze. "It is fundamentally impossible  for you to defeat me here."</p><p>Ranma  quickly spotted him, standing just as unconcerned as ever, but  perched on thin air some fifty meters out from his current location.  Rather than leap blindly in pursuit, he changed strategic gears and  fell back on a familiar tactic. "Really... then why did you take  off after I belted ya last time? If you're so sure I can't beat  ya then why are you playing keep away, coward?"</p><p>"Perhaps  because this only serves as a distraction, a waste of my time and  yours? This is a dream, Ranma... nothing you can do here has any  physical consequence." Norou answered patiently. "Participating  in a common brawl is far from my intent, as I have already explained  repeatedly."</p><p>"Wait  a sec... this isn't just a dream; it's MY dream!" Ranma  charged his unwilling foe, running across the open space as surely as  if it were a paved street. Ahead of him clouds circled and closed,  metamorphosing into steel bands to encapsulate the figure. "You  can't keep running away if I don't let ya!"</p><p>The  young man's advantage was very short lived, however. With a tired  shake of his head the cloaked man disappeared again in a puff of dark  fog, leaving his heavy bonds to fall freely to the ground far below.  Ranma's newfound control lapsed at this change, and, despite his  better intentions, he could not prevent himself from plummeting after  them. As he fell he grit his teeth and clamped his eyes firmly  shut, fighting his own fear response and whirling subconscious to  find a way out of this mess.</p><p>"Yes,  clever of you to realize you can control the rules of your  dreamscape," came honest praise from his reluctant foe. "However,  I am no mere figment of you dream, Ranma. You can't make me go  away with a whim."</p><p>The  problem, he suddenly realized, was the world. As long as it  remained, he'd have to keep resisting his instincts and  understanding of its workings to have any hope of fighting Norou on  an even level. With all the force of will he could muster, he shut  out the sensation of the wind cutting into his limbs as he plummeted,  ignored the sights and sounds and smells of the world until his  perceptions consisted of just himself in an empty void, all alone  with his enemy. Cautiously he opened his eyes to find the view very  much the same as when they were shut.</p><p>"Is  this meant to prove something?"</p><p>Ranma  looked up (not that up seemed to have much meaning anymore, he noted)  to see that his opponent was still simply floating in place,  casually. This lackadaisical attitude infuriated him, making it  quite easy to summon a very potent burst of crimson chi and launch it  in Norou's direction. Rather than blaze a trail towards the  figure, however, it slowed as it moved, eventually coming to a stop  midway between them, still crackling with unresolved destructive  potency.</p><p>Norou  slid effortlessly to the side, reestablishing line of sight between  the two. "Do I honestly have to beat some sense into you before  you'll listen?" he asked, his voice trailing into a sigh.</p><p>Ranma  paused, sensing an opportunity. "Tell you what... If ya stop  dancing around long enough to actually beat me, then yeah, I'll  listen. If I win though, you have to stay the hell out of my head  from now on. Deal?"</p><p>"Fine  then, I accept. Enjoy your requested serving of pain." Norou's  pale, boney hands emerged from the depths of his shifting robes to  make a strange twisting gesture. His image seemed to blur suddenly,  like ripples on a pond, only to reform as a view of Ranma's own  back.</p><p>Ranma  puzzled at this odd scene just long enough for him to notice that his  chi attack was again moving, followed thereafter by a searing pain  from behind as the angry chi impacted with him and exploded. The  force of the impact sent him spiraling out of control, twisting and  twirling without respect to any frame of reference and leaving him  with a nauseating sensation of dizziness. For a moment he caught a  glimpse of his enemy, still quite some distance away, but was  distracted by a wave of sudden impacts into his body from all sides,  as if being assaulted by invisible fists and feet. He tried to roll  with the phantom impacts as best he could, but they came too fast and  from all sides seemingly at once. His vision blurred and his body  burned when the onslaught ended, leaving him feeling as if he had  just gone three rounds against a Ryoga who knew the amaguriken  technique.</p><p>"Do  you yield?" the pale man asked simply.</p><p>Ranma  silently shook his head to indicate no, determined to fight through  the pain.</p><p>"Are  you quite sure? It is no shame to lose such a match, given the  circumstances." Norou floated closer at a leisurely pace, throwing  the occasional punch haphazardly at the empty void. As each strike  ended the image of his limb seemed to hang in the air for a moment,  then fade away as if multiplied and pulled apart in layers, each  leaving a ghostly image drifting in different directions before  vanishing completely. "I'm sure you've no experience  whatsoever fighting in zones of variable time and space. It was  rather foolish of you to so willingly destroy the framework of your  dreamscape; at least there I was forced to bend the rules you live by  rather than break them at will."</p><p>"Don't  matter," Ranma spat. "Stupid tricks won't stop me. Match  ain't over yet."</p><p>"As  you wish."</p><p>Another  wave of blows came, but this time Ranma was ready for them. At first  they hurt, but as he silently repeated the mantra 'only a dream'  the sensation faded away into just the vaguest sensation of pressure.   The ache of previous blows melted away as well, leaving him fresh  and ready to continue.</p><p>"That  all ya got?" he taunted, then released a swath of vacuum blades  towards the robed man, concentrating on keeping its path true. For a  moment the image seemed to ripple again, but then the blade cut  through the plane of the effect, shattering it like glass. Norou  blinked, then quickly floated out of the path of the attack, barely  dodging the trailing edge.</p><p>"Unfortunately  for you, Ranma, no, it is not," the figure replied evenly. "If  phantom pains will not dissuade you from this foolishness, perhaps  real ones will."</p><p>The  first change began as a dull ache, radiating from his lower spine  like an uncomfortable pressure. The sensation intensified as it  spread in waves, accompanied by an itching, tingling sensation like  all of her body falling asleep at once. With each wave the pain and  pressure was magnified, pressing in on him from all sides and then  flowing back out, as if her skin might burst as his body warped and  shifted.</p><p>"This  is no mere dream-stuff, Ranma, no figment. The pain you feel now is  real. This pain is happening to your real flesh right now, while you  lie helpless in bed. I repeat: do you yield?"</p><p>Time  seemed to slow further, and with it the sensations became still more  acute. The waves of pressure washed over her accompanied with  searing heat now, charring away her hips, her breasts, all her curves  becoming just so much smoke, ash, and dripping, melted fat. They  flowed back out with icy sharpness, penetrating his muscles and  genitals like razors and hooks, stripping the bulk of his flesh like  shredded beef. Through it all her bones shifted and warped, his  joints creaking with the sudden torque of rapid expansion and  contraction, and her agonized screams came unbidden through his jaws,  finally beating out her pride and begging for his suffering to end.</p><p>"There,  was that so hard?"</p><p>"You  bastard..." Ranma moaned in reply, unable to find the will to move  even a finger as blissful numbness replaced all sensation of pain.  "You've been doing this to me for days now, haven't ya? Making  me suffer just for your amusement... just a damn sadist."</p><p>"Actually,  I was trying to teach you a lesson in humility after you struck me  the last time we met. Enjoying your torment was just an added  bonus," he explained with deadpan calm. "And of -course- I'm a  sadist... I wouldn't be much of a demon without finding a certain  pleasure watching the growing pains of others, now would I?  Especially since I'm a Soul Render by trade."</p><p>"Huh?"   Ranma replied cluelessly.</p><p>"Oh,  don't worry about the details. You will get the hang of it in no  time, I guarantee it," The pale man smirked, more or less kneeling  next to her weightlessly drifting form. "At the rate you've been  developing lately I would not be surprised if you were ready for the  next phase inside another two weeks."</p><p>"And  you're the voice in my head, too... the one that made me go psycho  on the Orrochi."</p><p>"Not  while you're awake, no. Too much trouble to manifest in the  physical world so far from my sphere of influence," he answered in  an oddly conversational tone. "But enough about that; you agreed  to listen, not to ask questions all morning."</p><p>"Said  I'd listen, not that I'd blindly do what ya want. Spit it out  already."</p><p>"Very  well. To put it simply, I am here to develop your latent talents,  Ranma, and to guide you down the dark path you've chosen."</p><p>"Path  that I've chosen? What path?" Ranma asked, interrupting.</p><p>Norou  stared at her silently until she shut her mouth. "As I was  explaining, I am what mortals refer to as a demon, but what you need  to understand is that soon you will be one as well. Your spirit  called out for aid in the caverns of Jusendo, and the darkness  answered your call. With your new strength you cut down the  would-be-godling... and I took notice. Now I am here to guide you in  the process you have begun... as a professional courtesy, you might  say."</p><p>"Me,  a demon... Right." Ranma deadpanned. "So say this is true;  what do you get outta it? I'm findin' the idea of a generous  demon something that just don't fit, ya know?"</p><p>"Oh,  just by helping you down the path I'm sure that all I want will  naturally come to me along the way. What meager profits I acquire  from this relationship will hardly be noticeable to you at all, in  the end."</p><p>"Sure,"  Ranma replied, "cause that don't sound suspicious at all." A  sudden spike of pain and pressure washed over her, serving as a  reminder to him why he was now listening to the pale man in the first  place.</p><p>Norou  assumed a more imposing posture, seeming to tower above him, as the  flames that seemed to pass for his eyes blazed with a harsh  intensity. "You haven't the slightest idea how..." he began,  but he trailed off, distractedly. Suppressing a growl, he continued,  "...annoying... it is to be interrupted so often. We will speak  again very soon, Ranma."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"Squee!"  the piglet roared in frustration as best it could, then sank  dejectedly to sit on the sidewalk and gaze at the morning sun, now  fully above the horizon. The sight offered proof that his conception  of The Way Things Are was certainly outdated now, but offered no  hints as to how the rules had changed. Was Akane available? Was his  constant opponent and occasional friend alive? Both? Neither? The  prospects were alternately thrilling and depressing, but as long as  Ryoga was... well, wherever the hell he was... the suspense would  only grow worse.</p><p>When  he was younger and more idealistic, Ryoga often imagined that his  navigational difficulties were the result of some mysterious curse,  and wondered just what his ancestors could have done to warrant it.  He often daydreamed that he would stumble across the secret to their  affliction and lift the mysterious stain from the Hibiki family line  by completing some great heroic feat of bravery. In fact this  pleasant fantasy was the original motivation for him to learn the  Art; preparation for the day when an opportunity would arise to earn  redemption.</p><p>Now  he was much more cynical, experience having provided numerous lessons  on the fact that the world was not a fair, orderly place. He  believed that if his getting lost was a curse (rather than a chemical  imbalance in his brain or something), that it was almost certainly  not something that had actually been earned. It was far more likely  that one of Ryoga's ancestors had just accidentally been in the  wrong place at the wrong time (like how he got this damnable pig's  body), and from that moment on his family was never allowed to be at  the right place at the right time. If that was true, then redemption  wasn't really a possibility; revenge, his motivator of choice these  days, was the only reasonable option left if he ever found the person  or thing responsible.</p><p>Still,  the naïve dreamer wasn't completely dead in Ryoga's heart...  quite the opposite in fact. He still hoped for an end to his  problems, but the knowledge of how remote the chance was that such  fanciful notions might come true had transformed them from uplifting  aspirations into something more akin to a cold stone wheel, on which  he sharpened his anger and despair. Often he tried to picture his  own personal heaven when he needed to push his usual Shishi Hokodan  blasts into the perfected form.</p><p>Such  was the nature of his relationships with Ranma and Akane, from a  certain point of view. He held out no real hope of defeating Ranma  in a fight, nor of wooing the apparently most desirable young woman  in Japan (if Akane's hordes of suitors were any indication), yet  found the bittersweet taste of second place strangely satisfying. At  least when he lost he knew where things stood. In contrast, those  times when it seemed he might actually achieve his goals often left  Ryoga feeling lost and uncertain, too paralyzed by the dazzling  possibilities to attain them.</p><p>It  was exactly this panic that struck when he was almost stepped on by  some careless oaf strolling back from the convenience store... and  saw that the oaf in question was none other than Tendo Soun. He  simply froze, unable to decide whether he should follow him back and  find out what happened or run away and enjoy the ignorance of bliss a  little while longer.</p><p>In  the end the choice was rendered moot when the Tendo patriarch  snatched him up by the bandana and dropped him into his grocery bag  where he stoically rode without complaint, wedged uncomfortably in  the paper bag between two cartons of cigarettes and a bottle of  vegetable oil.</p><p>"I'm  home!" Soun announced as he kicked off his shoes and quickly  removed the bottle of oil from the sack and slid the rest to the  small of his back.</p><p>"Not  so loud, Father," Kasumi's voice admonished as Ryoga's  conveyance walked towards the kitchen and leaned in the doorway.  "Akane and Nabiki need their rest."</p><p>"Quite  so... and here's what you needed from the store, daughter," the  Tendo patriarch replied as he sat the bottle on the counter, making  no move to fully enter the door.</p><p>"Father,"  Kasumi began with an insinuating tone, "What are you trying to  hide?"</p><p>"Um,  hide? Ha, as if I had any secrets worth keeping!"</p><p>"You  bought cigarettes again, didn't you." It wasn't a question.  "You've plenty already for the week, assuming you cut back like  you said you would."</p><p>"I  will, it's just that, um... they were on sale?" Soun guessed.</p><p>"Well, at least  Nabiki would say you're making progress," the eldest daughter  huffed.</p><p>"It's  a bit chilly out today... think I'll take a bath and warm up."</p><p>P-Chan  perked up at this comment and began struggling to get some leverage  from his cramped position. Soun apparently noticed and changed his  grip on the package so that he was even more confined than before.</p><p>"Don't  take too long, father. I'll have breakfast ready soon."</p><p>Soun  backed out of the doorway and made a hasty retreat towards the furo.  Once the coast was clear he removed the struggling P-Chan from the  bag and doused him with a bucket of cold water, washing away the  grime of the road. Ryoga squealed in protest, but was casually  directed with a thumb towards the tub. Soun, still fully dressed,  tore into one of the cartons. "...More like her mother every day,"  he grumbled.</p><p>P-Chan  took the suggestion, annoyed at the scene and his treatment but still  unsure how to deal with this situation.</p><p>"Don't  look at me like that, young man," Soun snapped as he ignited his  drug of choice. "I can't very well tell her that I finished all  of them since I learned of Ranma's return. Besides, I need to have  a talk with you, man to man."</p><p>"How  the heck did you know it was me?" Ryoga snapped.</p><p>Soun  exhaled in the boy's face. "Well it was pretty obvious when you  changed in the furo while I was using it, you know. I assumed you  knew that I knew, and abused my daughter's trust anyway."</p><p>"Abused?"  Hibiki echoed, stunned by the bluntness of the statement. "But I,  um... Hey, if you thought of it like that why didn't you say  something earlier?"</p><p>"Because  it suited my purposes, of course. Genma and I agreed that your  presence was forcing Ranma to reveal his feelings for Akane thorough  his actions."</p><p>"You  used me... that makes you every bit as much to fault as I am in  this," Ryoga reasoned, "so where do you get off telling me I  abused Akane's trust?"</p><p>"Keep  your voice down!" Soun hissed, then took another deep drag before  continuing. "Because the situation is no longer necessarily in my  favor, young man."</p><p>"So,  you know how Ranma, uh, ended up, I guess?" Ryoga hesitantly asked,  receiving a nod in reply. "So, who..."</p><p>"No-one;  Nabiki told me he spurned them all and backed out of the seppuku  pledge." Tendo coughed, then clarified, "Well that's more or  less what she said, anyway. She wasn't too specific."</p><p>"That  cowardly bastard! I'll..."</p><p>"You'll  wake up Akane and Nabiki if you don't keep quiet, that's what  you'll do."</p><p>Ryoga  sheepishly looked away, though his fist remained clenched. "So you  want me to kick Ranma's ass for you, is that it? Just point me in  the right direction. Mr. Tendo."</p><p>"No,  lad, I've no desire to have you beaten up at the moment," Soun  chuckled. "What I want is for you to clarify your intensions  towards my daughter. Do you truly care for her, or has it always  just been a way to get under Ranma's skin?"</p><p>"Yeah,  I care for her..." the Lost Boy replied, though left unspoken his  conflicted feelings for a certain other girl as well. Technically he  was breaking a promise to her just being here now, but that could  hardly be his fault... this time, anyway.</p><p>"Excellent!"   Soun beamed, patting him on the back. "I was rather hoping I  could count on you to cheer her up and keep her training on  schedule."</p><p>"You  really mean it?" Ryoga gasped.</p><p>"Of  course I do," Soun replied resolutely. "The future of the school,  and of my daughter of course, is utmost in my thinking. Now tell me,  son, how can I get a hold of your parents? We've got some things  to talk about as well, I believe."</p><p>"Um,"  Ryoga blinked, mind awhirl at all the changes happening in his life  today. "I, uh, don't really know, to be honest. They're away  from home as much as I am, near as I can tell."</p><p>"Hmm...  guess I'll have to work on that end of things, I suppose. No  matter." Soun replied, then extinguished his cigarette. With  cupped hands he gathered a little bit of water from the furo and wet  his hair, mussing it slightly. "Guess I'll leave you to a nice  soak then, my boy."</p><p>"Thank  you, Mr. Tendo." he replied with enthusiasm.</p><p>"Don't  think this comes without strings though, lad," the master of the  home cautioned. "For starters, you –are- going to tell her the  truth about her pet... right?"</p><p>"Uh,  yeah I, um, always kinda planned to... eventually."</p><p>"Well,  plan to do so soon," Soun replied as he shut the door to the outer  changing area. "And while you're at it, don't mention that I  knew you were cursed, okay?"</p><p>Ryoga  relaxed for a bit longer in the all-encompassing heat of the furo,  then rose and changed himself back into a piglet. He said that he'd  tell Akane, but didn't plan to do so just yet. He'd definitely  have to before she learned to project her chi though, he decided. It  would be much safer that way, in case she took it badly.</p><p>He  set off once again on a quest to find his love, this time making sure  to turn around if he saw anything outside. His aimless tour of the  house passed a frighteningly cheerful Soun and Kasumi, looking far  calmer then she had recently been. The lost pig continued about the  place, passing through the family room, twice ending up buried in  Happosai's treasure horde, and stopping for a moment to respect the  shrine from the dojo. He eventually found the staircase, and only  had to wander into Ranma's old room once before he found the right  door.</p><p>After  some acrobatic twisting while hanging from the doorknob by his teeth,  he at last heard the familiar snores of his beloved. She twisted  about her bed in a fury, apparently having one of those dangerous  dreams again. He stood by and waited out her slumbering barrage of  attacks on invisible foes, waiting until she wore herself out before  hopping up to the former battlefield of her mattress.</p><p>Satisfied  that he was safe for the moment, P-Chan burrowed his way under the  covers. She reflexively hugged him to her chest, and he drifted off  to sleep in comfortable bliss.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>A  single eye snapped open, squinted and blinked at the sudden  reintroduction of light to its world, then rolled about its socket in  search of the disturbance that had ended its rest. Finding nothing  out of place in the immediate area, it closed again.</p><p>Genma  yawned, scratched himself, and rolled over on his futon away from the  slightly open exterior panel door. If anything was wrong, the boy  would handle it anyway... no reason for him to get up yet. Briefly  he wondered just what he had done to earn Nodoka's displeasure this  time, the reason why he was sleeping on a traveling bed on the living  room floor of his own house, before deciding it was pointless to  speculate. Who can tell what women are thinking? Or if they think,  for that matter, rather than just react?</p><p>Ranma  might, he thought with a smirk, which would go a long way towards  explaining how... bitchy... his son was acting since China. Sure the  boy might occasionally be stuck in the body of girl, but that was no  reason to start letting silly, petty things like emotions cloud his  judgment... especially if they drove him towards blaming his  innocent, well-meaning father for even more of his own shortcomings.  Surely Ranma would be blaming him for the failure of his insane  'plan', as if he had anything to do with it in the first place;  even more reason to stop thinking and go back to sleep, he realized.</p><p>His  intention was brought up short by an anguished scream from upstairs.  Another one, he realized, ascertaining the reason for his  wakefulness. Great... that damned dream again. If Genma had made  any mistakes in his life, surely the Neko-Ken was the biggest. Ever  since the pamphlet had so cruelly tricked him into using its  forbidden training methods it was rare indeed for him to get a week  straight of decent sleep. The boy's screams, the echoing testament  to his great weakness. For a martial artist this was far worse than  the Jusenkyo curse; that was just a new limitation to overcome  coupled with an entire world of new possibilities and forms to  exploit. The Neko-Ken, however, impaired his fighting ability  greatly by giving him a weakness. Sure the boy -could- use a cat in  a fight to gain the upper hand, but more often than not the sudden  appearance of a feline was enough to send him running away like a  coward, the thought of using it to his advantage never even  occurring.</p><p>Another  scream finally roused the corpulent man to action. With an annoyed  grunt he shook off his coverings and sat up, pausing to take note of  the baleful glare from the room's other occupant.</p><p>"Hey,  I dragged off that... whatever the heck that was in the back yard,"  Ryu snapped. "Why don't you go be a good host for once and shut  off that racket?" The young man rolled over and adjusted his  blanket.</p><p>Genma  tiredly lumbered up the steps to the boy's room, intending to end  his pitiful nightmare by tossing him out the window... a surprisingly  effective means of dealing with the problem he'd long ago  discovered. Hopefully the lack of a convenient pond to toss him into  wouldn't render it ineffective.</p><p>What  he found behind the door, however, caused him to reexamine his prior  thoughts. A dream about cats wouldn't help explain why his son was  floating in mid air, surrounded by a black halo of chi, or slowly  changing genders without the apparent influence of a source of water.   This was a whole new kind of problem, and one he really didn't  want to have to deal with.</p><p>In  retrospect, it was probably an even bigger mistake to unseal his  techniques, to reveal them all those years ago to his sister's  husband. He well knew what he was doing when he handed over the  scroll of Yamasen-Ken, how it would unmake the man and destroy all he  still loved. Somehow the accidental death of his sister, which he  blamed the foolish man for due to negligence, was enough motivation  for him to look into that blackness once more.</p><p>He  wished now that he had been less of a coward when the young Kumon  first came calling, that he had met the challenge personally rather  than putting Ranma into the middle of the problem and once again  allowing his secret free. This rolling black halo that seemed to  swallow his son whole was somehow connected to those damnable  techniques, he was sure. Just looking at it now was enough to tempt  him to unseal his techniques again. To take what was rightfully his  from whoever might be presumptuous enough to keep it from him, and  cut them down without a second thought if they resisted.</p><p>Ranma  screamed again in anguish, the change happening rapidly and  repeatedly this time without pause, giving his pain an unnatural  warbling pitch.</p><p>The  sound snapped his train of thought and sent him staggering back into  the hallway, clutching his head. He clenched his jaw and narrowed  his eyes, focused on shutting out the dark whispers. No, he wouldn't  give in again, nor would he stand idly by. Through him the forbidden  techniques had destroyed two generations of his family, but it would  not do the same to his son!</p><p>He  sprang forward, but as he crossed the threshold of the door arcs of  black lightning shot towards him, numbing and chilling the flesh  where it struck. Feeling his knees and ankles begin to buckle, he  threw all his remaining strength into a horizontal leap, carrying him  straight into the maw of his foe. His stomach turned as he passed  the edge of the aura and he choked down bile, but kept the presence  of mind to grapple Ranma's now stilled form as he passed near. On  contact his arms and chest went cold and shivered uncontrollably, but  he held on long enough for his momentum to slam his son into the wall  before both crumpled to a pile on the floor.</p><p>"What  the... Get offa me, Pop!"</p><p>He  ignored the comment, instead pausing to take stock of the boy's  condition: Male, and apparently staying that way for the moment.  Not glowing or otherwise radiating bizarre energy. Not screaming.  Bound to obey the laws of gravity. A complete success!</p><p>A  sharp blow to the back of his ribs brought his attention back to the  situation at hand.</p><p>"I'm  really not in the mood for one of your surprise sparring sessions  today pop... even if you really need it", the younger Saotome  growled, then suppressed a yawn. "Geez, at least make sure you get  a good wrap-up on me before you use this stupid cradle attack. If I  wasn't such a nice guy you'd be missing a kidney right now."</p><p>"You  ungrateful little..." the large man sputtered as he released his  grip and rolled backwards into a crouch, then stood. "I just saved  you, and that's the thanks I get?"</p><p>"Saved  me from a decent night's rest, maybe," Ranma drawled, brushing  himself off.</p><p>"Sure,  you always scream and change sexes repeatedly during a good nap. My  mistake."</p><p>"You...  wait, you triggered my curse?" Ranma paused for a second, then  grinned. "Heh, no wonder I had that stupid dream."</p><p>"I  didn't say I changed you," Genma stated bluntly. "I said you  were changing... repeatedly, and without water. Excuse me for  showing a bit of concern."</p><p>"But  that doesn't make any sense!" Ranma protested.</p><p>"Actually  it makes perfect sense," Cologne interjected from her perch on the  windowsill, "if you are unfortunate enough to understand what is  actually occurring."</p><p>His  son took on a deceptively neutral posture... a sign that he expected  trouble. "I take it you and Shampoo had a chat?"</p><p>"We  did," the woman admitted as she hopped fully into the room, "and  I must admit I'm somewhat undecided how to feel about the way your  little game played out... however, that's not why I'm here.  Ranma, we're going back to the village."</p><p>Ranma  shrugged. "Well, have a nice trip then. It was nice knowing ya  and all."</p><p>"Perhaps  you misunderstood me," the elder explained. "I meant 'we' as  in you and I. Grab whatever things you feel are necessary and let's  be off."</p><p>"What?"  father and son both snapped, then glanced at each other warily.</p><p>Cologne  let out a frustrated huff. "I did some research last night after  we talked about your curse and your dreams. The short version is  that your body is being invaded by a powerful demon and I need to get  you back to the village where I'll have more resources to draw on."</p><p>"Are  you out of..." the young man began to complain, before being cut  off.</p><p>"So  the black aura the boy's been throwing around lately is because of  this demon?" Genma interjected, hopefully. A demon was something  he could fight and kill... and something that wasn't his fault.  Not like his sealed techniques, which became harder to resist abusing  with every use, like a common drug. Even now, after decades of  ignoring them, he was still tempted from time to time to unseal them,  even if only to win a sparring match. And if what Ryu had said was  true, Ranma had developed the techniques to a higher level than he  had... "And not because of my sealed arts?"</p><p>Cologne  looked at him quizzically. "No, Mr. Saotome, not unless you  learned them while training at Jusenkyo." She paused before  continuing, "Though the talents for Ki manipulation you passed on  to your son certainly could help explain why the demon chose him out  of all the available hosts. Regardless, time spent talking about the  problem rather than working on it is a waste we can't afford."</p><p>"Fine  then, just let me find my pack," he conceded.</p><p>"I  said I'm taking Ranma, not you," The old woman snapped. "I'll  have more than enough trouble explaining his unwed return to the  council without having his bumbling oaf of a father in tow. No thank  you."</p><p>"And  how do we know this isn't just a last scheme to drag me off to get  hitched to Shampoo?" Ranma snapped. "This whole thing sure  sounds suspicious to me."</p><p>"Shampoo  will not be traveling with us. I've given her several tasks here  in Nerima that will keep her busy for the time being."</p><p>Genma  grunted and his eyes narrowed. "Shampoo isn't the only Amazon  I'm worried about. Under no circumstance is my only son running  off into another country with you without supervision."</p><p>"Fine  then," Cologne snapped, poking her cane across the room. "I'll  bring her along."</p><p>"That  is acceptable," Nodoka agreed simply, standing in the hall outside  the doorway.</p><p>"You  can't be serious!" Genma roared, turning to face his spouse.  "You don't know the first thing about these people or the dangers  of the landscape!"</p><p>"Somebody's  trying to sleep down here..." Ryu yelled from downstairs, and was  quickly ignored.</p><p>"Pop's  right, Mom," Ranma agreed, though without the anger. "Hikin'  across China is no picnic."</p><p>"Despite  your father's comments, I'll have you know I am fully capable of  handling myself, Son." She unwrapped the handle on the family  blade as she spoke, which caused her husband to swallow reflexively.  "Besides, if the Amazons are a matriarchy wouldn't I be in a much  better position to see to your safety than your father?"</p><p>"Quite  so... motherhood is a highly honored trait among our people," the  elder replied.</p><p>"But  Cherry Dove..." Genma whined, resorting in his desperation to silly  old pet names.</p><p>"But  nothing, Husband," his wife replied coldly. "You took my son  from me for the better part of eighteen years... is it so hard to let  me take care of him for just a little while?"</p><p>"What  about Happosai? You should at least wait until after his funeral,"  he reasoned. "I'll go with Ranma and you can catch up later,  when everything is taken care of."</p><p>"Why  would she care?" Ranma puzzled aloud.</p><p>"I'm  sure you're more than capable of bagging, burning, and burying the  old bastard, dear. If you get confused ask Soun for help."</p><p>"How  can you say that about your grandfather, the man who raised you!"  the large man demanded.</p><p>Ranma's  mouth fell open. He staggered back a step and sat down on the edge  of the bed, his skin suddenly sickly and pale.</p><p>"You  know I was adopted, Genma, and I hardly think any of his antics can  seriously be considered properly raising me," Nodoka snapped,  though her eyes lost their sharp focus for a moment.</p><p>Cologne  hopped over to the bed and patted the young man's shoulder. "It's  not as bad as you thought... at least you're not blood related to  him."</p><p>"You're  still his family and Ranma is still his chosen heir!" Genma barked,  hoping his desperation wasn't showing through. "It would be  extremely improper for both of you not to attend his final ceremony."</p><p>"Elder,  this would be a crisis situation of sorts, yes?" Genma's wife  asked, still staring at him.</p><p>"Oh  yes, most definitely so," Cologne agreed.</p><p>"Then  there is nothing to discuss; the crisis takes precedence," Ranma's  mother stated with finality, turning her back on the stammering man.  "If you'll excuse us for a moment to pack, we can meet you  elsewhere."</p><p>"Yes,  that's fine... I'll meet you at the subway station in thirty  minutes. We'll take the southbound rail to Haneda Airport."</p><p>"But  that airport only handles domestic flights," Nodoka questioned.</p><p>The  old woman cackled and waved the concern away. "Oh, don't worry  about the details... It's already arranged."</p><p>"Don't  I get any say in this?" Genma snapped.</p><p>His  son looked between the two women, then shrugged. "Nope, doesn't  look like it, Pop."</p><p>"Well  if I can't go, at least take your cousin along to watch your  backs," he demanded.</p><p>"And  what makes you think he'd even want to go along?" Ranma snapped.</p><p>"I  don't..." Ryu called from below, "I just want to sleep!"</p><p>"See,  Pop?"</p><p>"Um...  but you still have to train him, right?" Genma added hopefully.</p><p>"I  thought you didn't want me to," Ranma replied with a sardonic  grin. "Besides, I already taught him the basics. He can work out  the rest of it from what I did last time we fought."</p><p>"Ranma,"  Nodoka interceded, "Perhaps it would be better if he came along.  Not that I doubt the sincerity of the Amazons, of course..."</p><p>"Of  course," the elder replied, with a hooded gaze.</p><p>"...But  you did promise to train him, not to leave him to his own devices.  It would be improper to leave the job unfinished, and at any rate it  would make your father more comfortable."</p><p>"Not  by much," Genma grumbled.</p><p>"Fine,  I guess I can always use a sparring partner anyway," Ranma  consented. With a smirk the young man yelled out, "Hey Ryu, pack  up your stuff! You can sleep on the plane!"</p><p><b>Author's  Notes:</b></p><p>Seriously,  the next chapter should not have a delay anywhere near this long.  I'm actually a little embarrassed at how long I put this off while  working on other various non-fanfic projects. For those of you  still reading the series despite my excruciatingly slow updates,  thank you!</p><p>Secondly,  following a philosophical debate with reviewer Obsidian-Fox (far and  above the little bit in his posted review) in which he convinced me  that the argument presented in the last act was flawed, I've  decided to rename the previous act "Shuffling the Deck of Fate"  and to update the section of the author's notes dealing with the  title. No actual story content will be altered, though.</p><p>If  you got caught up on one of my 'Chinese-ized' names for the  Amazons, please note that these versions should really only show up  when a character is speaking of another in Chinese (or, in the case  of Mousse's list, for attempted Takahashi-esque comedic effect).  If you notice an example of this use in description, however, please  let me know so I can fix that.</p><p>Also,  while I don't know how my long absence will affect readers, I do  know that I've lost several of my pre-readers. If this chapter  felt a bit 'ehh' compared to previous ones... that's probably a  big part of it. To combat this problem, I ask that anyone who would  like to sign up to pre-read for the next chapter please let me know  via email. This isn't just a way to see the work early and get  your name on the credits, however... I really do want serious help in  the areas of:</p><p>1) catching  spelling &amp; grammar errors that I and spellchecker missed.<br/>2) insuring  believable characterization (not fanon based)<br/>3) improving  readability / clearness of description / sentence flow<br/>4) feedback  on plot/actions/theme/jokes/whatever else comes up</p><p>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #2 (reclaiming my former position... with probation)</p><p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered!
