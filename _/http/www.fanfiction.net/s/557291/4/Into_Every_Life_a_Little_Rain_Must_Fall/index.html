They look to be recovering slowly  though, so that means..."</p><p>"Kiya!"</p><p>"...if  I use the gains from the other holdings to buy it up while it's still  cheap..."</p><p>"Kiya!"</p><p>The  tirade of resonating shouts from outside, each followed by a loud,  splintering crash, finally managed to dislodge the thought  mid-sentence from Nabiki's mind. She closed her eyes tiredly and set  her forehead on her desk, rubbing  her temples in a futile attempt to alleviate the low, throbbing  headache that Akane's latest 'training session' was causing. Idly  she wondered just what had managed to get Akane so riled up this time  that she could hear her actions even on the second floor, on the  opposite side of the house.</p><p>With  her train of thought derailed, Nabiki decided to give up working on  the family finances until her younger sister's latest tantrum ended.  With a sigh she saved her spreadsheet and turned off her laptop  computer, an outdated model but still her most prized possession, and  closed its screen with a sharp click. She used to take it  everywhere, but since Ranma's arrival she had found it more prudent  to keep her treasure locked safely away in her desk, lest random  hi-jinks rob her of her prize. As she approached the stairs she met  Kasumi, wearing a slightly-less-than-immaculate apron, just beginning  the climb.</p><p>"Oh,  Nabiki," the older girl said, slightly startled. "I was  just coming to tell you that dinner is almost ready."</p><p>"Thanks,  sis. I can't get any work done with all the racket outside anyway.  I'll just go wake up Ranma, then, while you round up the rest of the  herd," she replied.</p><p>"He's  asleep again?" asked Kasumi with a hint of scorn. She closed  her eyes and took a deliberately calming breath before continuing.  "But he took a nap yesterday, and slept all night through as  well."</p><p>"He's  just recuperating, sis,"</p><p>With  a patronizing smile on her face, she shook her head. "If you  say so," Kasumi replied offhandedly as she turned, muttering as  she left, "but I'd just as soon let him sleep through dinner as  well."</p><p>Nabiki  shrugged off her sister's oddly persistent bad mood and walked across  the hall to the Saotomes' room, noting the odd flashes of light that  shown through the cracks around the doorframe. She opened the door  without knocking (she was expected, after all), but immediately  froze, staring open-mouthed at the scene before her in a combination  of awe and shock. Yes, even after living with Ranma for nearly two  years now, some things were still capable of surprising her.</p><p>Ranma  was still fast asleep, but it seemed that at some point he had become  uncomfortable with his bedding, having abandoned both his blanket and  bedroll. Not too unusual, except for the fact that he had apparently  decided that he would be more comfortable if he hovered nearly two  meters above the floor. Not only was he was hanging weightless in  air, but his aura was blazing with an incredible display of brilliant  light, bright yellow peeking through a shimmering black shroud of  energy. He suddenly began moving his limbs as if desperately running  despite his horizontal posture, and cried out, "Get them off of  me!" in what she could only assume was raw terror.</p><p>His  unconscious plea, through sheer clarity of intent, managed to  overcome Nabiki's initial shock. She rushed across the room and  hesitantly reached through the aura, feeling a tingle of static  electricity and a slight chill of raw fear shoot through her hand and  up her arm. She shook him by the arm until his eyes flew open  suddenly to stare at her. He sucked in his breath and held her gaze  for one long instant before gravity resumed control and slammed him  into the floorboards at her feet.</p><p>"Any  survivors?" she asked, taking a knee next to him. "I know  weird stuff happening around you is just par for the course, but  seeing you flying in your sleep is something new altogether, Ranma."</p><p>"Huh?"  Ranma asked, rubbing the back of his head as he sat up. He stared at  her for a moment while the words tried to sink into his brain,  blinked twice, and said, "Uh, can you repeat that?"</p><p>She  glanced downward to collect her thoughts for a moment, but the sight  of Ranma sitting before her in only his boxers made that somewhat  more difficult. Her eyes traced fine paths along his smoothly toned  stomach, around his chiseled pectorals, along his collarbone, and up  his neck to focus on his thick, inviting lips. So very close...</p><p>"Nabiki?"</p><p>She  flushed slightly, looking away from his under-dressed form sharply.  "You were flying. You know, defying the laws of nature and  such."</p><p>"Flying?"</p><p>She  felt the redness of her cheeks lessen, and turned back to face him.  "Well, more like hovering I suppose, about two meters off the  floor. You also had a sort of halo blazing around you in yellow and  black, like you and Ryoga occasionally do in your fights." she  clarified with the aid a few hand gestures.</p><p>"So  it was a chi effect?" he puzzled. "I know what yellow  is..." he noted, uncomfortably, "but black? Hmmm, maybe  it's similar to the way Herb flew with his chi. No, that was a white  light... Crap, I wish I had a gotten a better look at that technique  of his..."</p><p>"That  aura of yours was kinda creepy," continued Nabiki. "Come  to think of it, it looked a lot like what Gosunkugi described the  other day: Huge and black, with another color underneath it. At  least you didn't damage the floor this time," she noted, feeling  along the floorboards lazily.</p><p>"I  still haven't figured out how I did it the first time," he  muttered. "It counters Hinako's drain, it lets me fly... just  what have I tapped into? I've just gotta figure it out, if only for  the sheer potential it has. Maybe it's because I went to sleep while  projecting my aura to speed up my healing?"</p><p>"I  just watched for a moment, but then you started screaming so I  decided to help out," she continued, ignoring his babbling and  martial arts jargon.   "Let me guess... Cats?"</p><p>"Yeah,  I had that same damned dream again. It's been the same dream over  and over again ever since I killed Saffron," Ranma explained  with a sigh, turning his face away.</p><p>"Ranma,  you killed someone. A god, even. That's bound to affect your sleep  for a while at least, if only to even out your karma." Nabiki  put a hand lightly on his shoulder, idly noticing that she couldn't  tell which one was injured recently, even with his shirt off. "Would  it help to talk about it? I won't even charge you for the impromptu  therapy session this time."</p><p>He  turned to face her, glancing at her hand but making no move to remove  it. "No, you don't understand. Saffron isn't even in the  dream. None of you are, either, except for just these calling  voices. It's just me in the woods alone, and then the c...cats, and  then there's this weird guy who says things I don't want to hear, and  I can't get away from him."</p><p>"So  who is it, Ranma? What does he say?" she asked, setting down  cross-legged in front of him.</p><p>Ranma  looked away from her eyes and toward his injured ankle, examining its  healing progress as he sputtered out a reply. "I don't know who  he is... but he seems somehow familiar. I don't think I've ever met  him, but something in me seems to feel slightly... drawn to him.  Really creeps me out. I can't remember what he was saying, but it  was definitely not something good."</p><p>"Well,  what were you doing?" she asked, "in this dream, when you  met the guy? What form were you in at the time?"</p><p>"I  was a guy, which is really weird considering it was raining."</p><p>Receiving  no obvious help from the situation, Nabiki tried to concentrate on  Ranma's interpretation. "You said you felt drawn to him, and  that he said things you don't want to hear... Ranma, are you sure  you don't remember, or do you just not want to remember?"</p><p>"No,  I don't... Wait, what are you trying to say? It wasn't a gay thing,  all right! I'm not like that! Hell, what happened on the roof  should<br/>prove  that to you well enough!"</p><p>The  vehemence in his denial was rather unexpected. "I didn't say  anything about being gay, Ranma, but I am curious as to why that is  the first thing that came to your mind."</p><p>"It's  probably just because while I was at Ucchan's Mikado Sanzenin showed  up and kissed Konatsu. Damned faggots."</p><p>Nabiki  stared at him for a moment before responding, "You know, studies  suggest that those with homophobic issues are more likely to actually  be closet homosexuals themselves. The potion seemed to affect  everyone, not just those who would normally be attracted to me. At  least I hope so, in Akane's case..."</p><p>"Look,  just lay off the gay stuff already!" he said, scooting away from  her. "It wasn't like that! It was more like he was somehow  related to me, or like I was somehow destined to meet him... Kind of  a gut-level sorta thing."</p><p>"...Just  a cigar, huh?" she replied with an unreadable grin as she rose  to her feet. "All right, I'll stop bugging you about it for  now. Hurry up and get dressed, sleepyhead. Dinner is waiting."</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"After  all the shit I went through today for her, now she starts trying to  tell me I'm a fag? She's the one who held off on that kiss, not  me..." complained in the relative safety of his own head while he  scoured his room for a clean shirt. "Better to just forget that I  guess, before I get into any more trouble with Akane."</p><p>Ranma  finished dressing and hopped downstairs, estimating it would still be  a day or two until his ankle was back at one hundred percent.  Shallow cuts, bruises, and light burns he could heal in hours, but  other injuries still took time even with the aid of his family's  secret chi healing technique. His father's teachings weren't  completely useless after all, just mostly.</p><p>He  took his usual seat at the table. His father was in the middle of a  lively discussion over the plans for rebuilding the dojo: Soun  wanted it exactly the way it was before, Genma thought a larger  floor, higher ceiling, and several points to affix portable  obstructions and fake trees would be better for training in the  Anything-Goes style. Nabiki sat across the table, listening to the  discussion with calculator in her hand and a frown on her face,  noting the results in a small notebook. Akane walked in and sat next  to him while still drying her hair from a bath, looking a bit worn  out. Lastly, but most importantly, Kasumi came in from the kitchen  carrying steaming bowls of rice, chicken, and vegetables.</p><p>As  Kasumi dished out the food Nabiki asked Akane, "Did you manage  to work through your temper tantrum with all that racket?"</p><p>"It  wasn't a tantrum," Akane replied as she chose her chopsticks, "I  was cleaning up the remaining debris and doing some training at the  same time."</p><p>"Really?   Maybe there's hope for you yet." Ranma said in a mocking tone.</p><p>Akane  growled at him, but turned her attention to the food laid before her.</p><p>"Training...  it sounded to me like you were just breaking it up. Nothing new  there, Akane" said Nabiki coyly, "and your brick breaking  has always been more about blowing off steam than any kind of real  training."</p><p>Akane  was ready to yell a reply, but Soun spoke up first. "All three  of you, stop it. I want no more arguing tonight."</p><p>"But  she..." Akane began.</p><p>"Quiet!"  Soun demanded. "I've had a headache all day, and arguing with  Genma over the dojo's new floor plans has tried my patience for the  evening. No more."</p><p>Genma  opened his mouth as if to say something, but wisely decided to stuff  it with food instead.</p><p>They  ate in silence for a few minutes, with Genma and Ranma actually  eating in a somewhat normal fashion, until Kasumi broke the silence.  "So how was your day at school?"</p><p>Akane  blushed and studied her food even harder. Ranma looked at her for a  moment but Nabiki spoke up immediately. "Oh, nothing too  unusual. A magic potion caused a pervert stampede, but Ranma saved  me. Oh, and I got an A  on my calculus quiz."</p><p>"That's  nice," replied Kasumi going back to her dinner.</p><p>Ranma,  reaching for a second helping, elaborated. "Gosunkugi was up to  some scheme to get Akane, but he goofed and got Nabiki instead. So,  I had to rescue her and took her to Cologne for a cure. Oh, and I  took care of Hikaru already...  gave him a bit of his own medicine" he stated proudly.</p><p>"That's  nice," replied Kasumi without looking up.</p><p>"Huh?"  he responded to her lack-luster comment.</p><p>Kasumi  looked up at him with a sharp gaze. "I said that's nice. You  managed to indirectly cause some trouble, prevent the new  complication from doing any real harm after sufficient chaos had  ensued, come out looking like the hero yet again to pump your  over-inflated ego, and then sleep off the majority of the afternoon  while the rest of us have work to do." Kasumi went back to her  dinner, waving her index finger in a circular motion. "Hooray  for you."</p><p>Ranma  slammed his chopsticks flat on the table, bringing everyone up short.   "Kasumi, what exactly is your problem lately?"</p><p>"I  said there would be no arguing tonight!" Soun commanded.</p><p>"I  ain't arguing, I'm just asking a question," Ranma replied  coolly. "If anything, I'm acting to remove an existing argument  that has gone on far too long already."</p><p>"My  problem?" Kasumi asked with feigned innocence. "Ranma,  you're the only problem here."</p><p>"Ranma,  prepare to die!"</p><p>He  immediately sprang away from the table to land in a one-footed combat  stance and simultaneously avoid the attack that he knew was coming.  He looked rather silly for a moment, staring at the table when  nothing happened to the spot he had just been sitting in. He  imagined he looked even sillier when Ryoga landed a solid kick to his  back while his attention was focused elsewhere, launching him over  the table, through the door, and into the yard where he landed in a  heap.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>Ryoga  stepped out into the yard and dumped his backpack unceremoniously  onto the grass as Ranma hopped back up to a one-footed standing  position.</p><p>"That  was a cheap shot, Ryoga," Ranma stated as he brushed off his  shirt.</p><p>"Hey,  it isn't my fault if you've become a little predictable." He  replied with a smirk as he cracked his knuckles.</p><p>"Can't  this wait a bit? I was kinda in the middle of something," Ranma  asked, not assuming a stance but remaining alert.</p><p>"I  was kind of in the middle of my life when you decided to interrupt,  Ranma. It's only fair I get to return the favor, I'd say."  Ryoga pulled his red combat umbrella out of its straps on the top of  the backpack, and advanced at a slow pace.</p><p>"You  might have noticed the crutch? I'm not up for a friendly spar today,  Ryoga, but if you insist I'll put you down hard and fast so I can get  back to dinner."</p><p>"Oh,  widdle Wanma has a boo-boo? Fine then, I'll give you a handicap."   He removed two bandanas from his forehead and tied them together,  then proceeded to tie his left ankle to the back of his thigh,  leaving him similarly balanced on one foot. "Anything else you  want to bitch about, or can I kick your ass now?"</p><p>"Why  are you even here? I thought you were going to Akari's place,"  Ranma asked, still puzzled.</p><p>"That's  none of your damned business!" Ryoga bounded towards his foe,  opening and tossing his umbrella to the side as he approached.</p><p>Ranma  ducked and rolled out of the way of Ryoga's punch and turned toward  umbrella, approaching on its return path. He pointed one hand at it,  and with a burst of chi it was reduced to ash. "Come on, Ryoga!   These tired old techniques are a joke now! What's next, you gonna  throw a bunch of those bandanas at me again?"</p><p>Ryoga  was almost shaking in fury both from the all-too-familiar taunts that  rang just a little too close to the truth for his comfort and the  destruction of his property. "Do you know how long I'll have to  save up to buy another one of those? Shi-Shi Hokodan!"</p><p>Ranma  only smirked as the bluish purple ball approached him, which he hoped  over and responded with a flare of orange light at close range large  enough to completely cover Ryoga's field of vision. "Ask me  if I care," he remarked as the blast knocked Ryoga several feet  to land on his back towards the front of the house, next to the gate.</p><p>"That  really hurt!" Ryoga marveled as he forced himself to stand up off  of the suddenly oh-so-comfortable lawn. "Since when did Ranma have  this kind of power? Sure, he beat Saffron, but that was just a punk  with a glass jaw, and even then he only won because of luck and that  magical staff, right?"</p><p>"Are  we done already? Good, my father might not have eaten everything  yet."</p><p>Ryoga  sprang up with a snarl, but as he did he noticed the lack of a dojo  on the other side of the house where he thought it was supposed to  be. He could always be wrong, though.</p><p>"Damn  you, Ranma! I wasn't planning on revealing this yet as I haven't  fully tested it, but you've left me no choice! Beware my new  technique, Resshin Ki-Ken!" Ryoga's aura blazed as he punched  the ground between Ranma and himself, his fist enshrouded with blue  light. Immediately the ground began exploding as if he had used his  normal Bakusai Tenketsu, but the blast began to expand outwards in a  cone towards Ranma, the explosions and the rocks blasted free,  growing larger as the cone widened. He looked up from his attack,  and smiled at the widening swath of destruction rolled forward.</p><p>Ryoga's  grin faltered, however, when rather than panicking or even looking  slightly shocked, Ranma simply hopped twice toward the blast and to  the side, nonchalantly picking the few small stones that flew towards  him out of the air as the twenty meter long blast moved harmlessly  by. "That's your new secret technique, huh? Wow, combining the  Shi-Shi Hokodan with the Bakusai Tenketsu... very original. I only  thought that up eight or nine months ago. Good name, though."</p><p>Ryoga's  speech stumbled with his disbelief and rage. "You liar, Cologne  never taught you the technique! I'd have noticed the difference if she  had!"</p><p>"Who  said anything about the old ghoul teaching me? Hell, I learned it  just watching you and Shampoo using it all the time," Ranma  explained as he leaned against the wall carelessly. "Besides, I  don't want the smashed-with-big-rocks treatment. You may have gotten  tougher, but your speed sure took a hit in return, Ryoga."</p><p>"I  know you're lying because you never used it before, not even when you  fought Herb or Saffron!" Ryoga answered as he stood up,  breaking the bandanas that held his left leg easily to stand rooted  on both legs.</p><p>"I  didn't use it on Herb because it's a stupid move and easily  avoidable, and I was kind of in the air the entire fight with  Saffron, so anything using the earth as weapon was kind of out,  idiot." Ranma stood away from the wall and turned towards the  door. "Look, if that's all you have to show me, I'll be going  back in now. See ya around."</p><p>"That  bastard!" Ryoga seethed. "No matter what I do, he's always one  step ahead, some way to counter or use my techniques against me!  What's wrong with me? Why am I so worthless? Why don't I just go  off and die somewhere?" He looked to the blast he had caused  earlier, then to Ranma's unguarded back. With a howl of desperation  he burst into green flames, and then slammed both fists into the  earth.</p><p>Ranma  paused to stare at his hands as he suddenly was enveloped in a  black-lined aura, but was shaken from his thoughts as Ryoga cried out  "Bai Resshin Ki-Ken!" Summoning up his chi as he took to  the air, Ranma leapt directly over the moving field of destruction  and pointed his widely-spread fingers in a round arc towards the  front of the blast. With a cry of "Bakusai Rei Hari",  narrow beams of force shot from each of Ranma's fingertips to lance  into the un-shattered ground and explode in a half circle of 10  small, precise explosions. The rolling mass of exploding earth  collided with the explosions on all sides of it's advancing edges,  and although cracks spread beyond the point of collision, the  explosive effect stopped.</p><p>"What...   What the hell was that?" Ryoga demanded as Ranma stood with his  back still towards him, still glowing that ominous black, watching  the dust settle. He suddenly felt very tired, far more than the  projection of chi should have left him. Wait a second... since when  does Ranma have a black aura?</p><p>Ranma  turned halfway around with a single hop and glared at Ryoga coldly.  "That would have taken out the house, Ryoga, so I stopped it  with one of my other special moves derived from the Bakusai Tenketsu.   You know, since you seem so damned eager to show me your moves, how  about if I show you a few of my latest creations as a reward for  being such an idiot?" Ranma began hopping about as he spoke,  with a flare of red and black energy spiking from his uninjured foot  with each bounce. "How about we start with the Emkaku Tenketsu  Dan? Won't that be fun?"</p><p>Ryoga  was about to respond, but before he could his whole world turned  upside down as the ground beneath his feet exploded in a fountain of  stone. He wasn't injured by the blast, but he was somewhat dazed and  was thrown a few meters. The second blast, again from directly  beneath him, however, did sting a bit. After the seventh he was  getting rather sore, and when the twelfth and final blast threw him  directly into Ranma's waiting one-handed grasp, he was ready to admit  defeat... though very reluctantly, of course.</p><p>Faced  with the reality of just how much he had underestimated his rival,  Ryoga grudgingly admitted that he had no real chance. "I give  up… for now."</p><p>Ranma  lifted him a bit higher, and, with a cruel smile, said, "Oh?  But we've just reached today's final lesson. Do try to hold out a  little longer, Ryoga. I wouldn't want you to miss the Ryuujin Kenma  Koku."</p><p>He  felt himself tossed high into the air, and, looking down as he  tumbled, he vaguely noticed that the twelve blast craters had formed  two parallel lines of alternating craters between Ranma and the outer  wall of the compound. He was still wondering at the coincidence when  he fell in line with Ranma's fists, moving in opposing circling  directions, and two impacts of vastly different temperature struck  him.</p><p>He  realized his peril in the instant the hot and cold waves met, and a  funnel of wind tossed him horizontally towards the far wall, all  along the way battering him with the loose rocks freed from the earth  by the previous technique. The world went black for Ryoga, but  somehow he vaguely knew that he hadn't even hit the wall yet.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>"I  wouldn't want you to miss the Ryuujin Kenma Koku," he snarled.  Ranma tossed Ryoga into the air with one hand, gathering chi into  each of his palms separately. First hot, anger-fueled energy into  his left hand, then put cold chi into his right by reaching through  his anger to an icy hate. He began to rotate them in opposite  directions without letting the trailing lines of force touch, and as  Ryoga fell into alignment he crossed the paths and punched him with  both clenched fists. As planned, the resulting cyclone threw Ryoga  across the yard into the wall and then smashed him from behind with  the loosened rocks, leaving only a small mound of rubble with one arm  sticking out on top.</p><p>"Ranma,  what the hell have you done!"</p><p>He  turned to find the Tendo family standing in the doorway with various  reactions. Soun was enraged, and he could feel the slight traces of  chi that would become the 'demon head' already beginning to gather.  Akane looked worried, but kept looking back and forth between him and  the pile of rubble, unsure of whom to help first. Nabiki was gazing  about the yard with a cool, calculating  gaze, her eyes pausing for a moment on each crater. Kasumi stood  next to her father, whispering something into his ear. His father,  standing towards the rear behind Soun and Akane seemed to be... no,  he was definitely trying to hide behind them, but staring directly at  him.</p><p>"Answer  me young man!"</p><p>As  predicted, Soun did indeed deploy his fear technique, but to no  effect as Ranma studiously ignored him in favor of studying the  sudden flaring of his black aura. With a smirk, he decided to test a  theory, raising a hand and pointing to see if it could be made to  drain Soun as it had Ms. Hinako. No sooner did he think about it  than the 'demon head' dissipated and his aura briefly flared. Akane  saw this and apparently decided that Ryoga needed her help more at  the moment, leaving the doorway to rush towards the rubble. Genma,  seeing one of his defenders leave him, made an effort to sneak away  quietly into the house.</p><p>"He  attacked me for no reason, and I defended myself. What more is there  to explain?" replied Ranma brashly.</p><p>Soun  sagged slightly, leaning on Kasumi for a moment, but was not to be  dissuaded from his anger. "The yard, Ranma! Look what you've  done to my yard, plants, and wall!"</p><p>"First  the dojo and now the grounds... will you destroy our home as well  before the week is finished?" demanded Kasumi.</p><p>"The  house? I just defended your house from a clumsy attack by that  moron!" he exclaimed, pointing a thumb towards an unconscious  Ryoga as Akane unburied him. "The dojo was more his fault than  mine, too, and the same with the yard now. If you want to toss  around some blame, just wait till he wakes up."</p><p>"Ranma,  we all saw the end of that fight. I don't know how you did it, but  you have to admit that you are responsible for at least some of these  craters." Nabiki added, "Couldn't you have beaten him  without the explosions?"</p><p>The  black aura was fading quickly, and with it, his temper gave way to  more rational conversation. "Okay, I admit I got a little  carried away there at the end, but the rest of it was all Ryoga's  fault."</p><p>Kasumi  chose this moment to speak up. "Ryoga's fault? Maybe, but then  whose fault is it that he came here looking for a fight in the first  place, Ranma? It always comes back to you, either directly or  because of something you set in motion years ago."</p><p>"Yes,  it does appear that way," added Soun. "This is the final  straw, Ranma. Engagement or no, I want you out of my house until you  have dealt with all of your... complications, male and female."</p><p>"But  dad, you can't just kick him out in his condition," Nabiki  began, pointing toward the remains of the Bai Resshin Ki-Ken. "And  look at this blast pattern, he obviously is telling the truth about  the house."</p><p>"I  can, and I have, daughter. Ranma has proven tonight that he is more  than capable of taking care of himself even with his injury."  Thunder rolled in the sky above.</p><p>"Fine  then, I'll just gather my things and be on my way," Ranma  announced, hopping forward.</p><p>Soun  stood defiantly in the doorway with his arms crossed, blocking his  path. "I'm afraid that won't be possible. I'll send Akane and  Nabiki to school  early tomorrow with a change of clothes for you."</p><p>"Keeping  my rightful property from me again, Tendo?" Ranma asked as  Akane approached with Ryoga in a fireman's carry. She glanced at him  with sympathy, but continued on her way without comment. "This  is becoming a common theme."</p><p>Soun  moved aside to allow Akane in, then ushered Nabiki in as well, who  complied reluctantly. "Not at all, Ranma. I simply think it  prudent to insure you have a reason to return, rather than simply  running out on yet another engagement."</p><p>"You  think that I would do something like that?" Ranma demanded.</p><p>Soun  stepped inside and shut the door, replying as he closed it, "I  know your father might, which is reason enough to suspect the same of  you, Ranma."</p><p>The  latch clicked shut, the porch light went off, and Saotome Ranma was  left standing alone in the night air as the first drops of rain began  to fall.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>It  was a bright and sunny day, and the sky was an impossibly rich swath  of blue dotted with wisps of soft clouds like windswept bits of stray  cotton fibers. The grass was tall and green, and it tickled her  ankles as she ran barefoot in a white sundress towards her mother,  Akane not far behind. They reached the blanket, breathless from  their run but still smiling, as Mother and Kasumi set the food out  for a picnic lunch and Father finished assembling a bright red  plastic kite with a long yellow ribbon tail. She sat down to rest a  moment and to examine her newfound prize, a golden-yellow sunflower  as big as her head, as Akane dashed off with Father to try out his  creation.</p><p>Nabiki  recognized the dream immediately, a child's abstract recollection of  one of the happiest days of her life, a Sunday picnic with her family  when she was seven. She often dreamed of it, the last Tendo family  outing before mother started getting sick, but somehow being lucid  during the experience ruined the effect completely for her.</p><p>The  mundane events continued around her, and she played her part, but her  mind was drawn back to the present, wondering where Ranma was  tonight.</p><p>The  exaggerated taste of a sweet custard pie brought her back in time to  the dream, but did not remove Ranma from her thoughts. "If she was  seven then he was six, and that meant... my god, he could have been  in the middle of the cat fist training while I was relaxing in the  sun."</p><p>A  crack of thunder shattered the peace of the dream, and looking up  from the flower she spied in the distance a dark forest where before  there was only an endless sea of gently rolling grass-covered hills.  The sky was now overcast and gray, the air slightly cool, and the  grass grew pale and sickly. The flower in her hand rotted away to  dust as she stood up and marched towards the woods, ignoring her  family as they continued to laugh and play as though the world was  still a friendly place.</p><p>She  followed a foggy, twisting trail through the thick bramble and  imagined that the sound of the wind in the branches was like a quiet,</p><p>familiar  whisper. She walked for what seemed like ages, growing to her true  age as she traveled, until she heard a scream of terror echo down the  trail from just a bit farther into the forest. She ran down the  trail now, stumbling across roots and rocks, but not allowing herself  to fall.</p><p>The  fog thinned out as she barged into a sheltered clearing, and blanched  at what she saw there. Ranma, six years old and helpless, was held  upside down by one ankle, his injured one, above a rough earthen pit  by a tall, thin man with grayish, corpselike skin and a dark flowing  robe. "Would you will yourself back into the pit just to avoid  this conversation? How many times must we play this game before you  pay attention?" the stranger asked. "The change is coming  soon, young one, and you must be prepared for it or it could destroy  you!"</p><p>"No,  not the pit again! Please, just leave me alone!" Ranma begged,  his young eyes locked on the shifting darkness beneath him in  undisguised terror.</p><p>"Leave  him alone!" she commanded, making her presence known to the two.   "If you want to tell him something, you would get far better  results by simply talking than with threats, whoever you are."</p><p>The  man tossed Ranma aside with disgust and turned to regard her. "To  willingly enter this nightmare and show the courage to become an  active participant is commendable, though perhaps foolish. Still, it  doesn't forgive your complete misunderstanding of the situation."   He turned to Ranma, who was busily untangling himself from a thorn  bush, and announced, "I'm not sure how you brought her here,  Ranma, but rest assured we shall continue this later, in private. I  have a duty to perform, and soon enough you shall have one of your  own."</p><p>"Who  are you, and what do you want?" Nabiki demanded, pushing through  the almost tangible fear this... man was causing in her just by  looking at her.</p><p>"Such  irony... the guardian asks the questions she was summoned to help him  avoid. Still, the rules are quite clear; it is not for your kind to  know who I am, nor what my interests are, mortal, but you may refer  to me for now as Norou Mizumei." With that, he closed his cloak  around himself and evaporated into shadow and mist.</p><p>She  turned to check on Ranma, but a sudden, irresistible force seemed to  grab both of them and drag them away from each other, warping the  world around  them as they passed. "Nabiki!" he called again and again  as he vanished into the distance, "Nabiki!"</p><p>"Nabiki!"</p><p>Reality  reasserted itself as her eyes sprang open, and glorious sunlight  peeked through her window to stab her eyes. With a groan she rolled over  and hit her alarm clock, which had not yet rung, and then attempted  to burrow deeper into her covers.</p><p>The  covers were yanked out of her grasp, however, and she was roughly  shaken by the shoulder. "Get up, Nabiki!"</p><p>"G'way,  'Kane. Too e'rly," She mumbled, rolling into a tight ball on  her naked bed.</p><p>The  insistent hand of her sister left her shoulder, only to be replaced  with a soft, gentle one playing with her hair. A wisp of hot breath  played over her neck and a deep, throaty voice whispered in her ear,  "Tendo Nabiki, I would ravish thee and claim thee my own."</p><p>She  was wide-awake in an instant, bolting completely off of her bed to  land wide-eyed across the room, still clutching her pillow. A quick  glance around the room revealed a wildly laughing Akane to be the  only other person present.</p><p>"Damn  it, Akane, don't do that! You nearly gave me a heart attack!"  she yelled, throwing the pillow at Akane and catching her square in  the nose in an unguarded moment.</p><p>"If  you could have seen your face..." Akane trailed off, trying to  control her laughter. "But at least you're up finally. Come  on, we have to get  to school early today to meet up with Ranma."</p><p>"We?   You have to meet up with your fiancé; I'm just going to class  as usual," Nabiki replied, annoyed. Akane just shrugged and  left with a careless smile, leaving her to dress as she grumbled  about morning people.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>They  left the house nearly an hour earlier than normal, walking the  distance to the school in an uneasy state of silence. It was amazing  what a difference  an hour made to the look and feel of Nerima, now gray, quiet, lonely,  and a bit unsettling as opposed to the busy people and crowded  streets Akane was accustomed to seeing.</p><p>Nabiki  was still angry about the way in which she had woken up, she  expected, judging by the icy silence that she had offered throughout  breakfast. She hadn't even made a comment when P-Chan was found  rummaging through the kitchen for food or when they discovered that  Ryoga must have gotten lost some time in the night and wandered off.</p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>She  paused and turned to regard her sister, replying, "It speaks?"</p><p>"God,  you're going to think I'm crazy, but," Nabiki hesitated, which  was very uncommon for her, "do you believe that dreams can mean  something?"</p><p>"What,  like a vision of the future?" Nabiki nodded. "Nah. I  think that if dreams mean anything it is about things in the present  you aren't aware of consciously, or things in the past you haven't  dealt with. Why? Weird dream last night?"</p><p>"Weird  doesn't seem to cover it," Nabiki replied, going back to the  original question. "You really don't believe it's possible,  even considering all the weird stuff that happens around here?"</p><p>"Well,  to be honest, I don't believe half of the stuff that's happened to me  personally, much less things that haven't," Akane admitted. "I  guess a dream could be prophetic, but I'd have to have one before I  believed it, and even then I'd probably chalk it up to coincidence."</p><p>"Yeah,  you're probably right," Nabiki replied, looking a bit relieved.  "I most likely only had that dream because Ranma told me about  his right before dinner and I somehow absorbed parts of it  subconsciously."</p><p>"You  had a dream about Ranma?" she asked, looking quizzically at  Nabiki. "Nothing too exotic, I hope. Can't have you getting  ideas about my fiancé, sis."</p><p>"Nothing  like that... honestly, you are so possessive of him," Nabiki  remarked in a haughty tone.</p><p>"Damn  straight I am, and don't you forget it," Akane replied with a  bit of humor, but with a hard undertone nonetheless, as they reached  the school gates. "Alright, where the hell is... Ranma!"  she yelled, dropping her bag to dash towards the school doors.</p><p>Nabiki  picked up the dropped bag and followed after her, finding a petite  redhead curled up in the doorway, shivering, with her clothes soaked  completely through to the skin. Akane took off her jacket and draped  it over Ranma, rubbing it roughly to warm her up.</p><p>"Did  you actually spend the night here?" asked Nabiki, helping to get  Ranma up on her feet. "Why didn't you go to Ukyo, or Shampoo,  or one of your friends' houses?"</p><p>"I  don't feel quite... comfortable around Ucchan's right now, Shampoo  and Cologne would have drugged me and hauled me off to China by now,  and I, um, don't really know where Hiroshi or Daisuke live," she  answered a bit meekly. "I had hoped I could sneak in and use  the showers to warm up, but the place was locked up tight and I  figured I shouldn't destroy anything else last night."</p><p>Akane  looked away guiltily, but said nothing.</p><p>"I  figured that at least it wasn't raining under the overhang here, and  I had to be here today anyway, so why not? I mean, I sure would have  preferred to at least have my tent last night, but your dad thought  otherwise." Ranma turned to regard Akane. "Would have  been nice if my fiancée had stood up for me just a little bit,  too, but I guess that's too much to ask. I mean, she didn't say  anything at all about it being my fault, she just didn't argue in my  favor."</p><p>Akane  immediately replied to the barb, shouting, "I didn't say  anything because I agreed with him! I know Ryoga started that fight,  but it is your fault, just like Kasumi said. I don't think he should  have thrown you out, but that's the only place where my opinion  differs. Ranma, you have got to do something about these rivals and  fiancées of yours before the situation gets even worse, or  we'll never be able to have a normal marriage."</p><p>"Gee,  ya think I should? What would you suggest I do, ask em all nicely to  just bug off?" she snapped.</p><p>"I'd  suggest you stop yelling and get inside before you catch a cold, Mr.  Saotome," interrupted Ms. Hinako as she walked up the steps in  her child-sized yellow rubber raincoat and boots. She walked to the  door and unlocked it, holding it wide open for the teens to enter,  but never taking her eyes off of Ranma.</p><p>"Here,  Ranma, go and get warmed up," said Nabiki as they entered and  removed their shoes. She handed over a paper bag full of clothing  which</p><p>Ranma  eagerly accepted, then watched her run, not hop, down the hallway  towards the men's gym, yelling out her thanks as an afterthought.</p><p>"I  thought he had a torn ligament," Hinako noted, puzzled.</p><p>"So  did I," replied Akane.</p><p>"Well,  that's Ranma for you, never one to be held down by the limits of his  own humanity," Nabiki answered, walking toward the stairs.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>After  a long, hot shower and a change of clothes, Ranma felt like a whole  new man. This physical comfort, combined with the fact that his  ankle had healed overnight, even faster than he expected, was enough  of a positive swing in his luck that he momentarily felt pretty good  despite recent events. He sauntered into class four minutes early, a  personal record, and slumped into his seat for his usual morning nap.</p><p>"Well  you certainly look better, Ranma. I'm surprised you didn't catch a  cold."</p><p>He  opened one eye to regard Akane with a skeptical glance, and then went  back to trying to sleep. "I've had worse. I grew up on the  road, so why should one night homeless bother me?"</p><p>"Got  kicked out again, Ranchan? What for this time?" asked Ukyo from  behind him.</p><p>This  time he kept his eyes closed while answering, hoping in vain that  they would catch the hint. "Yeah, just the same old stuff.  Ryoga dropped by and I kicked his ass, but Mr. Tendo got mad about  what we did to his yard. He said I can't come back until..."  something in the back of his screamed a warning, and for once he  listened. "Well, for a damn long while."</p><p>He  paused for a moment, turning towards Akane. "How is the moron,  anyway? I didn't kill him, did I?"</p><p>"Well,  we put him in your room to rest," Ranma glowered, but she  continued, "but he must have been okay because he left sometime  in the middle of the night. Oh, and P-Chan is back!"</p><p>"That's  typical," Ranma stated. "I'm on the street and the pig has  two beds to sleep in."</p><p>Ukyo  broke in before Akane could reply. "Why didn't you come over to  my place, Ranchan? I wouldn't mind putting you up for a while."</p><p>"Uh,"  Ranma began, fidgeting slightly, "Well, it was kinda late to be  dropping by, and I wouldn't want to be an inconvenience or  nothin'..."</p><p>"...And  you didn't want to be around Konatsu," said Ukyo, finishing the  unspoken part of his sentence. "You think I didn't notice how  fast you bolted after that little scene? Honestly, sugar, you can be  such an insensitive jerk sometimes."</p><p>"What  about Konatsu?" asked Akane.</p><p>"All  right everyone, in your seats," called Ms. Hinako as she entered  the room. "Let's see, I believe today we were going to be  discussing second impact..."</p><p>"Again?"  asked a wiry, nameless teen with dark eyes next to the windows.</p><p>Ranma  was pondering exactly why it was Ms. Hinako thought it best to teach  them about things she saw in her favorite anime shows, rather than  anything practical  or even remotely relevant to history (what first period was supposed  to be, anyway), when the intercom blared to life. "Saotome  Ranma, you bad keiki, need be comin' to da Big Kahuna's office!"</p><p>"Sure,  why not?" he muttered as he stretched and then rose from his  chair. "It's not like I've got anything better to do."</p><p>At  a leisurely pace, he made his way down to Principal Kuno's basement  office and slouched into the wicker chair that sat waiting for him on  the beach. "So what do you want?" he asked bluntly as the  principal, who had yet to notice him, finished trimming the leaves of  a large coconut tree.</p><p>"Aha,  you be comin' much fasta den me expect, keiki. Good, no hafta go  look'n fo ya, den," he said as he climbed down the tree into a  large canvas hammock. "You know, keiki, you always being one o'  my favorite students..."</p><p>"Is  there a point to me being here?" asked Ranma bluntly.</p><p>"I  no be wantin' nothin' from ya, jus' have ta be givin' ya da messages,  see?" he replied defensively, waving his arms in large gestures.</p><p>"Messages?"  Ranma asked, curious. "Okay, what are they?"</p><p>"Well,  I be havin' two fo' ya," he confessed, "one good, one not  so good. Which you wan' hear first?"</p><p>Well,  it would take a lot to top what's happened in the last few days.  "Um, bad I guess."</p><p>"Well,  dat message be from the school board. Dey be seein' yo attendance  record, and say you missin' too many o' de school days, and leavin'  early on most o' de rest." The principal paused and removed his  glasses, giving Ranma a stern but remorseful look as he finished,  "You is bein' expelled, keiki."</p><p>"Expelled!"   Ranma jumped across the distance between them and pulled the  principal from his hammock by the neck, throttling him. "Are  you out of your mind? Not one of those absences was my fault! I  sure as hell didn't want to be here but I came everyday unless some  deranged nut-ball demanded my attention. Come to think of it, your  family is responsible for more than a few of those instances!"</p><p>"Ahk!   Ke...Keiki, you no be hearin' da g...good one yet..." he  struggled to reply.</p><p>Ranma  stopped choking him, but did not release his grip. "Good for  me, or good for you?" he asked with a hard tone.</p><p>"Ah,  good fo' both, I be thinkin'!" he replied as he sat up and  rubbed his throat. "Be gettin' ya back in de school, be makin'  me little 'dachi happy, and be saving yo' parents a mess o' trouble."</p><p>"I'm  listening."</p><p>"See,  da board be expellin' a Saotome Ranma, but dey ain't be sayin'  nothin' bout a Kuno Ranma!" he explained excitedly.</p><p>"Huh?"  was the only reply that came to mind.</p><p>"Oh,  don't mind him, Ranma Darling. I can explain it all so much clearer  than he with that dreadful accent." Above him, Kodachi was  lounging</p><p>on  a tree branch, dressed in her proper uniform rather than the leotard  for once. She leapt down from the branch to land in a short bow  before him, then stepped closer to trace her fingers along his jaw.</p><p>He  pulled her hands away but did not step back. "I'm still  listening."</p><p>"Oh,  it is the best news!" she began cheerfully. "It seems that  quite some time ago your father made a substantial loan from one of  our banks."</p><p>"Your  banks?"</p><p>"You  no be tinkin' we be livin' da high life on de school salary, do you  bruddah?" asked the principal in a patronizing tone.</p><p>"Ahem."   Kodachi cleared her throat while glaring at her father, who looked  away for something else to do. "Yes, dearest, the Kuno family's  wealth comes mostly from our real estate dealings, but a substantial  portion of our finances originate with the chain of banks we own."</p><p>"Okay,"  Ranma replied, "whatever. Just get to the point."</p><p>"Well,  your father took out a substantial loan almost sixteen years ago in  order to finance a... training trip, I believe the records say, a  loan which he has failed to repay by the deadline, yesterday."</p><p>"That's  not surprising," he answered.</p><p>Kodachi  smirked and continued, "Well, under normal circumstances we  would simply take him to court, but in this case there is a  complication dealing with the nature of the collateral he put up  against the loan: You, in fact, as an arranged husband for me."</p><p>"That's  not surprising either, to be honest," Ranma admitted with a  sigh. "Just how long have you know about this, Kodachi, just  out of curiosity?"</p><p>"Oh,  for a while now," she answered as she tiptoed closer to him.  "You have no idea how hard it was to keep it a secret until the  engagement was official, how many nights I spent alone knowing that  my patience would eventually pay off."</p><p>"If  you knew about this, why did you keep trying to blackmail, drug, or  otherwise coerce me into being with you?" he asked, holding his  ground but keeping a sharp eye on her.</p><p>"I  suppose I simply couldn't stand to sit back and do nothing while  those other harlots abused you so, Ranma darling." She reached  out to embrace him, but Ranma stepped away from her grasp.</p><p>"You  do realize that I'm already engaged three times over, right?" he  asked, hoping to dissuade her from this fantasy. "Then again,"  he wondered aloud, "does another fiancée even make a  difference at this point?"</p><p>"Hey,  what you be sayin' der, bruddah?"</p><p>"Hold,  Fiend! While I may have rashly given my consent to this unholy  pairing, it shall have to wait until my divine vengeance has been  fulfilled!"</p><p>Faced  with the entire Kuno clan at once, and not sure whether beating up on  any of them would still be a reasonable action considering this new  information, Ranma did the only sensible thing... he ran like hell.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>He  stood, tall and majestic in his countenance, directly before the  gates of the school so that none might pass outside of his gaze, as  he waited for the arrival of his mortal adversary. The many sounds  of a city called out on the wind, but to him they all shouted  "victory!" with glorious trumpet blasts.</p><p>Everything  was in perfect order for the confrontation. His precise lines were  memorized to the point of instinct. His hair was groomed with the  appropriately superior class and daring charm. This morning he had  ensured his clothing was finely pressed and resplendently clean. He  had arrived twelve minutes earlier than usual to insure that his  predictably timed foe did not attempt to elude his presence by  arriving at a reasonable hour. Truly, nothing could upset this plan.</p><p>When  the last bell rang, signaling the beginning of classes, and his foe  had not yet come into view, he was understandably dismayed. Had his  prey somehow entered unnoticed? Nay, impossible. Perhaps the  foolish Hibiki had triumphed where he had not? Again, he rejected  the thought as absurd.</p><p>The  only possible explanation was that the sorcerer had learned of his  plan through dark magics, and sought to unnerve his foe before the  fateful confrontation by playing this game of nerves. Well, no such  trickery would befall the Blue Thunder on this day! He would wait  the demon out, even if it took hours!</p><p>"Hello,  brother dear. How goes your hopeless quest?" asked Kodachi as  she strolled through the gate.</p><p>"It  goes well, sister mine," he replied, without shifting his gaze  from the horizon. "The trickster attempts to undermine my  resolve with foolish ploys, but it is I who shall emerge victorious  in the end!"</p><p>She  continued on her way towards the school. "Well, best of luck to  you then, brother, though I fear your iron determination is wasted in  this case  because of your self deceptions."</p><p>"We  shall see, sister. We shall see," was his only reply.</p><p>For  what seemed like an eternity he waited, standing stoically against  the empty streets, though some tiny spark of doubt began to form in  his soul. It was puzzling, indeed, to see his sister here on the  grounds of Furinkan High, especially when she did not attend said  institution. Were she of as pure and noble a heart as his twin loves  he would write off her presence as simply a token of esteem for such  a man as himself, but her motives were never so clear.</p><p>Why  come here, then? In the past, she had only appeared on the premises  in order to pursue Saotome himself, but surely that was not the case today...  unless, by some twist of fate, his foe had managed to slip by  undetected! Blast, he had underestimated his foe's cunning! With  unearthly speed  he made his way into the school and forced his way into the room  where his foe would surely be.</p><p>"Saotome!   I come to challenge you to a manly duel in the highest of arenas!  What say you?" he demanded as he kicked the door in.</p><p>"Um,  he isn't here, Kuno," replied his Fierce Tigress with obvious  affection. "He got called to your father's office a few minutes  ago."</p><p>"Truly?   So, the fiend thinks to ally himself with my other greatest foe! I  shall not be beaten, even by such as they!" he decried, racing  out of the room.</p><p>Again  he ran, pushing himself to the very limits to reach his destiny in as  short a time as possible. Forgoing the steps, he instead plunged  purposefully into the trapdoor, rolling as he hit the sand to absorb  the impact without losing speed. At last he reached his goal,  dashing through the ferns to discover his foe in alliance with his  father and, nearly in an indecent posture, his own sister.</p><p>"Hold,  Fiend! While I may have rashly given my consent to this unholy  pairing, it shall have to wait until my divine vengeance has been  fulfilled!" he cried as he charged. To his dismay his target  chose, rather than to hear out his challenge with honor, to flee.</p><p>"Ranma-sama,  don't run from my love!" called his sister as she joined him in  pursuit, tossing aside her uniform to reveal her favored purple  leotard.</p><p>"Runnin'  from me gracious offa'? You is a bein' a bad, bad keiki!" his  father pronounced gravely as he produced his sheers and fell into  step.</p><p>Had  his magnificence finally brought his family into the light of reason?  Surely the gods smiled on his endeavor if even his perverse father  and twisted sister had come to see the evil that is Saotome, and  chosen to join his righteous crusade! "Onward, Kinsmen! Sweet  victory sings of the house of Kuno this day!"</p><p>The  chase continued through the school's halls, outside of the gates, and  even into the favored shopping district of the local common class.  Across all manner of terrain he pursued his foe, with his family  close behind, be it on rooftops, beneath bridges, or through  merchant's stores, but he did not lose the trail nor fall behind.</p><p>They  were now traveling at street level, dashing amongst the morning  crowds as they procured comestibles from local vendors, when he  spotted a possible advantage in the crowds ahead. "Gosunkugi  Hikaru, I shall reward you handsomely if you halt the flight of this  scoundrel!" he shouted to his frail but occasionally useful  acquaintance.</p><p>The  boy in question turned at the shout, but like a coward he froze in  open-mouthed terror before the demon, who, sensing the newcomer to  the fray, changed his course to intercept him. With the puzzling  comment, "No cheating!" Saotome dashed by the terrified  boy and removed from his nose a clothespin, which had been affixed  there for some indiscernible purpose, with a sharp snap. The boy  howled in pain at this odd treatment, but the chase continued on.</p><p>Ranma  led a grand run through out the streets of Nerima with a variety of  encounters with people he recognized, such as the eldest Tendo sister  (who swore under her breath as he passed, after being vaulted over by  Saotome in a most  un-gentlemanly fashion) and the perverse old master who also lived  within the sanctuary of the Tendo home.</p><p>Suddenly  he felt a cold sense of trouble arising about him, a gnawing deep in  the back of his mind that he could not place until he rounded the  corner and saw the source, a wooden cart filled to overflowing with  watermelons. "Damn the fates," he mentally swore in tragic  fashion, "that not only saddled me with the insatiable will to  destroy the voluptuous fruit, but also made sure that my fated enemy  knew of this limitation as well!"</p><p>With  a kick, the clever fiend overturned the overburdened cart, throwing  the hated melons into the air in all directions about him. What  could the kendoist do but allow his foe to escape when an  uncontrollable urge forced him to pause his pursuit and precisely  section each and every ripened sphere with his mighty blade? Alas,  the technique proved too strong, not only for his father and sister,  but also for an unlucky purple-haired delivery girl who had joined  the chase at some point, all of which were left unconscious about him  while Ranma was nowhere to be seen.</p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></p><p>She  woke up completely disoriented, her head painfully throbbing along a  straight line across her scalp. She assumed she was not a prisoner,  at least, because of the soft, smooth bedding and the lack of bonds.  A pleasant but altogether unknown smell permeated the room. Strange  music played softly in the air. Risking opening one eye, she gazed  about a richly decorated Japanese room, taking in the sights but  recognizing nothing. It was dark outside, meaning that she had been  unconscious for at least six hours.</p><p>Hearing  footsteps from down the hall, she left the bed and took up a ready  stance in case her benefactor had any impure motives concerning her.  The finely carved wooden door opened smoothly, revealing a familiar,  if not altogether welcome, figure.</p><p>"Ah,  so the mysterious flower has bloomed at last! Excellent!" he  said, taking a seat on the bed and laying out a silver tray of food.  "Perhaps you would care for a meal?"</p><p>"What  stick boy want with Shampoo?" she demanded. Her stomach growled  as she eyed the food, but she made no move to eat it.</p><p>"Stick  boy? What a peculiar form of address," he replied carelessly.  "I am known as Kuno Tatewaki, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High,  age nineteen. You are safely within my domicile, under the  protection of all the Kuno clan, at present. You, my dear, I  remember from a rather strange confrontation regarding ramen noodles,  though I fear we have never been properly introduced. Please, sit  and eat something."</p><p>"I  am Shampoo of Joketsuzoku, and Shampoo no is hungry," she said,  but her stomach betrayed her.</p><p>He  cocked an eyebrow at the deep grumble. "Please, My lady, I must  insist. It is the very least I can offer after so rudely bludgeoning  you earlier  this morn."</p><p>The  memory of her pursuit of Ranma flashed back into her mind like a  movie in fast forward, a rush of images too fast to examine  carefully. She shrank back as the final scenes of the chase played  out, and all became clear. "You is defeat me? Then you are  Shampoo's airen. But Shampoo already have airen..."</p><p>"Is  there a problem, my lovely guest?" he asked, placing a hand upon  her shoulder. "If I may be of assistance, you have only to  ask."</p><p>"Shampoo  is... confuse. You come with me to Great-Grandmother," she  commanded, grabbing his hand. "She know how fix this."</p><p>He  followed her lead, mindful to bring along the sushi (which she did  eat along the way), across the rooftops of Nerima to the Cat Cafe.  Slightly impressed as the seemingly weak boy managed to keep her pace  easily, she led him  inside.</p><p>"Honored  Elder, I am in need of your guidance on an urgent matter!" she  announced in her native tongue as she entered the building, ignoring  Mousse as he hurried past with an order.</p><p>Cologne,  who was busy cooking for the dinner crowd, poked her head out of the  kitchen and ushered them back. "Child, how many times must I  tell you to speak only Japanese in front of the customers?" she  asked, once both were out of the main hall. "It is rude to do  otherwise."</p><p>"It  is perfectly acceptable now, however, if she chooses to speak in a  more familiar form," interjected her guest in accented but  technically correct  Chinese. "Please, make no difficulties on my account."</p><p>Shampoo  gasped and stared at him in wonder. "You speak Chinese? I've  been in Japan for nearly two years and you are the first person I  have met here who would speak to me in my language."</p><p>"I  am proficient in the diction of five languages, and Chinese is among  them," he answered. "Reading the historical and  mythological texts of great cultures  is a pressing interest of mine. Such tales lose much luster in the  reforging to other tongues."</p><p>"You  are to be commended for your studies, young one," replied  Cologne as she hopped up on her staff, "but what, pray tell, has  brought you here at such a busy hour?"</p><p>Shampoo  began to help with the cooking as she explained, "Great-Grandmother,  I have been defeated again. I am confused... who now is to be my  beloved?"</p><p>"You  have defeated Xian Pu in combat?" she asked him bluntly. "I  find this hard to believe."</p><p>"It  was not my intention, I assure you, but alas I must take  responsibility for her injury," he admitted. "In the  course of my training I learned a nearly undefeatable technique, but  unfortunately it has a cost; it inspires in my heart an instinctive  rage at the sight of watermelons, and I am unable to restrain myself  from striking the offending spheres no matter where they lie. The  cursed fiend, Saotome, knows of this weakness, and used it this morn  in a most cowardly fashion to escape my wrath as he fled, and your  great-granddaughter was caught in my path."</p><p>"In  my experience, Saotome Ranma fears only two things; commitment and  cats. Aside from your motivational interpretation, however, I find  no fault in your tale," Cologne replied before turning to face  Shampoo. "This is a rare complication, my dear, but not a  difficult one to deal with. By law, they are both your husbands to  be, until such time as an official challenge is made between them,  and then only the victor will be connected to you."</p><p>"Excuse  me, but am I to understand that because of this incident I have  somehow become legally required to wed Xian Pu?" Tatewaki asked,  bewildered.</p><p>"Technically,  yes," answered the matriarch, "though practically speaking  I don't believe you have any need to concern yourself with the  matter. Saotome Ranma will have no trouble defeating you yet again,  if my sources are truthful."</p><p>"Does  his lust know no bounds?" he demanded, striking a fierce pose.  "Already he controls the fierce Tendo Akane and my mysterious  pig-tailed goddess with his magics, and even my own sister has fallen  prey to his demonic charms to join the ranks of his ensnared young  women. Surely he is not the cause of great suffering for you as  well, Xian Pu?"</p><p>Shampoo  rapped his head roughly with her knuckles. "Don't you talk  about my beloved that way! By Joketsuzoku law he is promised to me,  and, were it not for the other girls who hound him, he would already  be my wedded husband!"</p><p>"So,  it is as I feared," he noted sagely as he rubbed his head.  "Then my duty is clear, prescribed by law and honor alike. I  shall challenge and defeat Saotome, not only for my pride as a  warrior and to free the hearts of women  everywhere, but also to win the deserving love of Xian Pu, my  lavender-trussed foreign beauty!"</p><p>"What  are you talking about?" Shampoo asked, completely puzzled.</p><p>He  continued on, uninhibited by her questioning. "Surely the time  has come, for all has fallen into alignment! Truly, the vengeance of  heaven is slow but sure!" He thrust his bokken high above his  head, puncturing a panel of the kitchen's drop ceiling. After  quickly taking Shampoo's hand and kissing it, he dashed off into the  night.</p><p><b>Author's  notes:</b></p><p>Sorry  it took so long to get this chapter out, but finals really slowed me  down in my writing and accidentally deleting the first draft didn't  help much  either. It gave me a chance to go back and redo the chase scene from Kuno's  perspective, though, which was a lot of fun to write. Believe  it or not, this story arc is beginning to tie itself up, and the  main plot is definitely easier to see forming than in earlier  chapters. There  is only one more chapter to go in this act (which I promise will be coming  shortly), completing the rewritten portion of this story! Woo hoo!</p><p>I  hope the fight scenes came off okay, as I had to put in a bit of effort  to find a style that seemed to work for me. I went back and changed the  Akane/Ukyo fight scene in 2:1 so that it would match this style  rather than  letting the overly descriptive version remain.</p><p>New  special techniques (in order of appearance):</p><p>Resshin  Ki-Ken Violent Earthquake Ki-Punch<br/>Bai  Resshin Ki-Ken Double Violent Earthquake Ki-Punch<br/>Bakusai  Rei Hari Blasting Spirit Needles<br/>Emkaku  Tenketsu Dan Remote Point Bomb<br/>Ryuujin  Kenma Koku Dragon King's Cutting Wind</p><p><b>NemesisZero,  AKA Brian #2</b></p><p><b>Reviews  welcomed, appreciated, and sometimes even answered!
