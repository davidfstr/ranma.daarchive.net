</div><p>Ranma walked hesitantly into the classroom and glanced at the faceless teacher before turning nervously to face the class. She glanced around for Akane and Ukyou, but didn't see them anywhere. Nabiki had said she wouldn't let Ranma go through this alone either. They weren't there, none of them.</p><p>There was a see of faces she knew only vaguely, and even those she didn't have a clear view of. There was something wrong with the lights in the classroom. Only one in the center of the room worked, and, when the door closed behind her, she could not see the edges of the room.</p><p>"Hi," she said quietly. Even so, the sound echoed dully through the dark room full of unfamiliar faces. "Ya heard the rumors I guess." There was a shuffling from the class.</p><p>Ranma scanned around the room, avoiding the faceless mass before her. She crossed her arms over her chest and looked down at her feet. She was wearing a dress. Her eyes narrowed and she looked around nervously. She didn't own any dresses.</p><p>"Oh, you poor dear," someone from the class said. The voice was low almost a purr. A small group of people approached Ranma, and she backed away towards the door.</p><p>"We made you a little something to make you feel better," another voice said. She couldn't identify the speakers, but she could see what they were bringing her. A steaming bowl of ramen.</p><p>"NO!" Ranma shouted and ran for the door. She found nothing but dirt walls, Ranma whirled around to face the other 'students'. Now he could see the faces, all the cats' eyes and ears, and swishing tails. The hands holding the ramen were thick and slitted, for holding claws.</p><p>"Come on, Fluffy," the voice was definitely that Jin girl's, but rendered cat like. Several hands gripped her and pulled her down, claws ripping at her dress. "You let everybody else have a taste, why not us?"</p><p>"I don't want to!" Ranma protested trying to curl up against the pulling, clawing hands.</p><p>"Of course you do," the voice was from the light, which wasn't a light after all, but the exit from the pit. "All girls want it, they just pretend not to."</p><p>"As he has said," Kuno-neko voice declared, as Ranma's panties were ripped away. "Did you not secretly enjoy our tryst."</p><p>"NO!" Ranma shouted forcefully.</p><p>"Airen must have know Shampoo do something to ramen." Ranma could see the purple cat on someone's shoulder. Strangely, aside from the older voice above, it was the only totally human voice, but Ranma didn't care about that right now. "Ranma eat on purpose." She sounded so confident of her belief.</p><p>"Let go of me!" Ranma shouted, lashing outward and slashing out with hands curled into claws. Her cries as she slashed about grew more cat-like as time progressed. She was becoming like them.</p><p>Even as she fought them down, she saw out of the corner of her eyes more cats being dropped into the pit and becoming cat-people as they landed. In the corners she could hear some of the cat-people making time with each other while waiting for a chance at her. Strangled birth cries began echo through the pit, like a horde of ghostly kittens that were seeking more than milk.</p><p>More were appearing than she could bring down. Eventually they would pull her down, and then they would have her. Again. And again.</p><p>"Ranma!" the voice came down from the hole in the top of the pit.</p><p>A rope came down from the exit, and Ranma looked at it in a mix of fear and hope. That's where the cats came from, that's where everything came from. Anything that wanted to hurt him came into the Pit through there. Besides, she belonged in the pit, she was dirty.</p><p>"Ranma, please!" the voice called out again. Was it a trick? Maybe outside the Pit there was nothing but cats. The distraction was costing her, the cats were getting further before she could take them down.</p><p>"Spread your legs, pervert," another Jin-neko purred from down below before Ranma kicked her head in. Kitten-Baby cries continued throughout the Pit, strangling, drowning in blood.</p><p>"Airen skin so soft," Shampoo-neko said, as she clawed down Ranma's back.</p><p>"Let me free you of this spell." Thick clawed hands reached for her throat.</p><p>Ranma had lost her vocabulary now, and she only hissed as she slashed out and ran toward the center of the Pit, under the light. Maybe Above was worse, but the Pit was intolerable. How could anything be worse? She climbed up the rope out of the Pit.</p><p>Strong arms held her as she reached the top. But these arms did not seek to violate her. Somebody rocked her, holding her naked, bleeding body and comforting her.</p><p>"You're slacking off, boy!" a harsh voice shouted. "You need to keep training." Somebody gripped her by the hair and tried to throw her back into the pit.</p><p>Ranma snapped awake, being held tight in Akane's arms. She wrapped her arms around Akane and cried into her spouse's shoulder. Akane stroked her back and rocked her gently. Ranma didn't care that it made her feel somewhat like a child, she was safe like this. She was out of the Pit.</p><p>"Do you want to stay home tomorrow?" Akane whispered as Ranma started to calm down and Akane could. Ranma could still feel herself shivering in remembered terror.</p><p>"No," Ranma answered firmly. She caught her breath and checked her hands for a moment, making sure they were still human hands. She had never tried the rope before. "I ain't hidin' anymore."</p><p>"You've said that before," Akane reminded her.</p><p>"Yeah, I know," Ranma said. "Don't let me fall." She said quietly, holding Akane.</p><p>"I won't," Akane answered, kissing Ranma's forehead.</p><p>Nabiki stared up at the ceiling until she heard Ranma and Akane go back to sleep. Then she stuck her head back under one of her pillows. Her second pillow kept the sun out of her face in the mornings. It also made an excellent gag, though not so good with only one hand to hold it with.</p><p>Tomorrow was the day.</p><p>She curled up under her blankets, awkwardly trying to accommodate her shoulder, and held down her pillow, hand shaking.</p><p>Kasumi woke up again at her normal time, not yet dawn. She sighed at her appearance in her mirror. At what point had they started to just accept the black circles under their eyes?</p><p>Kasumi was walking down the stairs and heard someone in her kitchen. She paused a moment to investigate and wasn't too surprised to find Ranma cooking.</p><p>"I woke up early again," Ranma said without turning around.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said. "No problem." She still hadn't turned around. "I woulda done some training, but Ryouga's still in the dojo."</p><p>"Cooking is very relaxing," Kasumi noted.</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said. "It's like katas, sorta. Ain't gonna throw away my Art for yours." She added the last firmly.</p><p>"I would not expect you to," Kasumi said. "Do you need any help?"</p><p>"Nah, I can handle this," Ranma said. "You should go back to bed."</p><p>"Whatever they say at school today," Kasumi said quietly. "It doesn't change anything here."</p><p>"Thanks Kasumi," Ranma said, pausing a moment, she wiped at her face before turning around. "I'm figuring that out." She turned toward the stairs at the sound of footsteps.</p><p>"Kasumi is..." Akane breathed a sigh of relief as she came into the kitchen and saw Ranma.</p><p>"I just woke up early again," Ranma explained again, turning back to the cooking. Akane sighed and glanced at Kasumi before moving to hug Ranma.</p><p>"It'll be fine," Akane whispered. Ranma nodded and leaned back in Akane's arms. Kasumi was turning to give them some privacy when Akane asked, "Do you need any help in here?" Kasumi and Ranma stiffened.</p><p>"Ummm, could you set the table?" Ranma asked nervously. "I want ta get this part done myself."</p><p>"You sure you don't want me to help with the meal?" Akane asked.</p><p>"No, I'm fine," Ranma insisted, sweating. "I just want to do it. Relaxing you know?"</p><p>"Relaxing?" Akane repeated, she had never really found cooking relaxing. If Ranma did, though, maybe it was better to let her do it. "Okay, I guess." She kissed Ranma on the cheek and then started to gather the plates. To the immense relief of Kasumi and Ranma.</p><p>"I shall be in the living room if either of you need any help," Kasumi said. She noticed that she was still in her night robe and added another comment. "As soon as I get dressed."</p><p>"Thanks," Ranma said. She quietly watched Akane taking the plates out to set the table and smiled briefly then returned to her cooking.</p><p>Ryouga came in through the gate yawning, half-wondering when the dojo had gotten that second bathroom. The one without the furo with little yellow "m"'s everywhere. He was also curious to know why they had built it so far away from the living quarters.</p><p>He hadn't known the Tendo compound was quite that large, in fact. Maybe it was like one of those dimensional pockets that was bigger inside than it was outside. Like Doctor Who's telephone booth or the Furinkan basement.</p><p>From the gate he meandered around the grounds until he came the rear entrance. Akane was setting the table for breakfast and he heard somebody in the kitchen and decided it must be Kasumi.</p><p>"Ryouga, what were you doing in the courtyard?" Akane asked as she looked up.</p><p>"Going back to the dojo from the other bathroom," Ryouga said as if it was obvious.</p><p>"Right," Akane said. She went back to setting the table. ~Don't ask.~</p><p>Ryouga saw Kasumi in the living room, and decided not to wave in case she was still upset with him. He was too tired to wonder how Kasumi could be both in the kitchen and in the living room. After all, he'd been wandering the Tendo compound for several hours trying to get back to his bed. He continued in his quest for the dojo.</p><p>Ryouga was confused when he hit the master bedroom. He was quite certain that that was supposed to be upstairs. Backtracking he found a closet, but the closet had another exit through a copy of the master bedroom. Then he was in another hallway, trying to figure out how the Tendos moved around their secret passages all the time.</p><p>Ryouga stopped as he heard a muffled sob behind a door. Turning he saw a sign on the door, "Nabiki" written in romanji. His first thought was wondering what Ranma was doing in Nabiki's room while Akane was helping Kasumi in the kitchen. Some left over of his long time tendency to think the worst of Ranma perhaps. Thinking it through, for once, he found that unlikely.</p><p>Ryouga knocked on the door hesitantly. There was some movement on the other side of the door.</p><p>"Hello?" Ryouga said. The door cracked open a little later, and he could see Nabiki peeking out.</p><p>"Tryin' to sleep 'Yoga," Nabiki whispered. "Tomorrow's goin' be hard."</p><p>"Ummm, Nabiki," Ryouga said. "It is tomorrow."</p><p>"Can't be," Nabiki protested. "Not asleep yet."</p><p>"Check your clock," Ryouga suggested. She looked away from the crack in the door for a moment.</p><p>"Masaka." Then there was a thud on the back of the door. "Itai."</p><p>"Are you okay?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"Fine," Nabiki said. "Be right out." The door started to close.</p><p>"Do you need someone to back you up?" Ryouga asked. Nabiki hesitated.</p><p>"Yeah," Nabiki said. "Thanks."</p><p>Kodachi was pondering that morning's meal. She had never actually eaten anything so simple before. Ranma's cooking seemed to involve rice with a little meat and very little seasoning. That and a salad she had made on the side. She had asked about it and had been told that it was camping fair.</p><p>"It's a lot tastier when you're in the middle of the forest, made over a wood fire," Ryouga had said.</p><p>"The smoke adds flavor," Ranma agreed quietly. Which had started a brief discussion about the virtues of different kinds of wood between Ranma and Ryouga. Kasumi had made suggestions, to Ranma, about how to duplicate certain flavors in a kitchen environment.</p><p>Kodachi listened with interest, missing her roses and pet. It was a pleasant distraction.</p><p>"We should probably leave the cooking to the men," Nabiki said. Nabiki didn't look like she had slept, and she was obviously fidgeting this morning. Ranma blushed and immediately quieted down, while Ryouga scratched the back of his head in embarrassment.</p><p>"Nabiki," Akane said, grimacing. Kodachi was confused with the exchange for a moment.</p><p>~She was including Ranma,~ Kodachi realized. She looked to where Ranma was sitting on Akane's lap. ~Don't they see it?~</p><p>Kodachi spent the last little bit of the meal by watching Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"We've been expelled," Ukyou shouted angrily coming to meet them on the road to school. She was in her boy's uniform, which was smoking slightly, but without her characteristic spatula.</p><p>"What?" Akane asked.</p><p>"That Hawaiian freak had us expelled," Ukyou growled. She gestured around their whole group. "All four of us."</p><p>"On what grounds?" Nabiki demanded coolly. Some of the obvious nervousness drained out of her, but not all, not even most. If the principal had made her stand impossible today, all he did was prolong it for a much more public situation later.</p><p>"I was busy dodging pineapples," Ukyou growled. She was obviously very frustrated, and her fists were clenching and unclenching. "But he said something about moral turpitude."</p><p>"What does that mean?" Ranma asked. Ukyou shrugged angrily, but Nabiki and Akane were pale with anger.</p><p>"He's actually going to claim that?" Nabiki asked quietly, gripping Ryouga's hand.</p><p>"What's he claiming?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"We're a bad influence," Akane snapped. "Most likely something to do with..." she hesitated a moment. "...sex." Ranma winced and held tightly to Akane.</p><p>"He's going to say I wanted it," Ranma said quietly, shaking. "Isn't he?" She virtually spat the question.</p><p>"Maybe," Nabiki said neutrally, fairly certain that was it. "Let's go see what he has to say."</p><p>The Principal was waiting for them at the gates, smiling broadly as usual. He seemed even more lunatic than usual. A crowd of students had gathered to see the coming conflict.</p><p>"No, no, no," he said, waggling his finger. "You all is expelled. Bad influence on da Bid Kahuna's keiki."</p><p>"We're a bad influence?" Akane shouted. "What about you?"</p><p>"Dis da Bid Kahuna's school," the Principal said. "And you follow de Bid Kahuna's rools. You is all bad for deesseepline."</p><p>"What rules have we broken?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Oooo, so meeny t'ings." He chuckled and started ticking off points. "Fighting on de campus, deestruction o property, suspeetion of murder, lood behavior..."</p><p>"He wouldn't take no as an answer!" Ranma shouted angrily stepping forward from Akane. She faltered at the sudden interest the crowd was giving her. "So h...he..." Akane stepped back up to her side and hugged her.</p><p>"Tacchi have eeny wahini he want," the Principal said still smiling. He didn't notice Nabiki smirk at the comment.</p><p>"Brilliant the Kuno's aren't," Nabiki muttered. Ryouga noticed the look in her eyes, the same one she got before she took Shampoo's hair ornament.</p><p>"He couldn't have me!" Ranma shouted, almost crying. Hinako struggled her way out of the crowd behind the gates and started walking towards them.</p><p>"Why blame someone else for yo' spilt milk," the Principal asked, this time quietly so the crowd couldn't hear.</p><p>"You arrogant bastard," Akane growled, holding Ranma tightly.</p><p>Ranma stared at the Principal blankly for a moment in shock. She clenched her fists angrily and clenched her eyes shut, turning her face away from Principal.</p><p>"Ranma," Nabiki warned. The redhead laughed once bitterly and suddenly relaxed.</p><p>"I ain't gonna fall for my own game," Ranma said quietly but firmly. She was still shaking in Akane's arms, angry and hurt.</p><p>"Let'S go back home," Akane said, kissing Ranma lightly. "We can fix this later." The Principal looked somewhat disappointed but was distracted by Hinako-chibi pulling on his sleeve to attract his attention.</p><p>"You know that was interesting what you said about milk," she said. "I hate wasting milk especially chocolate milk. Oh yeah, I have to tell you that I and some of the other teachers are going on strike."</p><p>"But you can't do that," the Principal protested.</p><p>"Oh and we're moving that you be removed," Hinako said. "For running an unsafe school." She started walking down the street.</p><p>"Dis is my school!" the Principal shouted. "And you must follow my rools! I hired you to enforce deesseepline." He took a step towards Hinako and she stopped to turn around.</p><p>"Principal," Hinako said in a sing-song voice, playing with a coin. "You wouldn't be thinking of trying to discipline me, would you?"</p><p>"All you want is revenge, not disicpline," Ryouga shouted. "And I should know what revenge looks like."</p><p>Small groups of students were passing through the gate and away from the school. The Principal didn't notice as he was preoccupied with his teacher and the primary troublemakers. He backed away from Hinako, and the others.</p><p>The Principal couldn't take Ryouga, Ranma or Hinako if they were alone, much less together. If Ranma had attacked, with no apparent provocation, he would have had more evidence, the Principal was unaware that a crowd of witnesses cut both ways, but Ranma had kept her cool.</p><p>"He's finished," Nabiki said smiling. The smile faded and she bit her lip. "But now everybody will know." She whispered, considering what was coming. This would hit the news for at least a little while. All because some jerk on a bureaucratic power-trip wanted revenge for his worthless son.</p><p>"You should go back and get some sleep," Ryouga said. Nabiki nodded.</p><p>"You blew it, jerk," Ranma said angrily, tears still flowing, before she and Akane turned away to firmly walk away from the school. Ukyou held her position for a moment staring darkly at the Principal before turning to head for her restaurant.</p><p>"Maybe I should have done something more than dump him in the basement," Ukyou muttered.</p><p>The dojo was quiet. Kodachi had gone to school, at her own insistence, and apparently Kasumi had actually gone to sleep as promised. Nobody had said anything after leaving the scene with the Principal.</p><p>Ranma had cried quietly, but mostly she was just sniffling and fuming. Akane and Nabiki were also fuming, Akane most obvious of any of them. Nabiki's expression was the veritable definition of ice, though it was very strained. Ryouga was nervous, as usual when he was with a girl or collection of girls, though more so considering the situation. He and Akane both shared a concerned expression as well, though Akane's was mostly focused on Ranma.</p><p>As they were entering the house, Nabiki stumbled over nothing and almost took a hard fall. Ryouga steadied her easily before she could hurt herself. She didn't even protest when he carried her the rest of the way to the living room and a couch. That certainly brought all of their attention to her for the moment.</p><p>"Nabiki, are you feeling okay?" Akane asked worriedly. "You haven't looked good all morning."</p><p>"I had a little trouble getting to sleep last night," Nabiki said. Ryouga cleared his throat and Nabiki rolled her eyes. "Okay, I didn't go to sleep last night." Ranma looked at her closely.</p><p>"You weren't planning on going through with that?" Ranma asked. "Were you?" Akane looked confused for a moment before she remembered what Nabiki had told Ranma a few days ago.</p><p>"Go through with what?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"I told Ranma that I would stand with him," Nabiki said. She turned to Ranma. "I made that promise, and I intend to keep it."</p><p>"You mean..." Ryouga was cut off by Nabiki nodding.</p><p>"Nabiki, you don't have to," Ranma said. "Everybody is interested in me, not you."</p><p>"Ranma," Nabiki said her voice trembled a little. "I'm not going to let you go through this and just sit on the sidelines saying 'don't worry about them.' That's somewhat hypocritical, don't you think?"</p><p>"Nabiki, are you sure?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I'm tired of hiding too," Nabiki said shakily.</p><p>Nabiki was trying to keep from crying, but it was difficult. She was far more tired than she was used to, her arm hurt like hell, most of her energy had already gone to keeping her composure this long.</p><p>"I'm giving Ranma all this advice," she said through choked tears, "and she's doing things I've been too terrified to even consider."</p><p>"I didn't make the choice," Ranma whispered.</p><p>"But you're surviving! You're doing it!" Nabiki snapped. "And I'm still scared!" She stood up and paced, fighting to keep her tears down. Kasumi quietly came down the stairs in response to the shouting but nobody noticed.</p><p>"Nabiki," Akane started.</p><p>"Nabiki knows what to do," Nabiki snapped, interrupting Akane. "Nabiki's the tough one. Nabiki's the smart one. Nabiki is in complete control of everything." She waved her good arm out to encompass the room and then turned towards them, virtually screeching now. "Nabiki didn't fight! Didn't even try! Nabiki," she twisted her name in self-mockery, "was stupid enough to go inside the guy's house!" She stood there shaking and staring wildly around. The crying was shaking her shoulder somewhat, and the resultant pain wasn't helping her keep composure.</p><p>Ryouga hesitantly stood up and reached a hand out to her. She grabbed it and then broke out into full weeping leaning into Ryouga. The martial artist cautiously hugged her.</p><p>"It'll be okay," Ryouga said, as Ranma and Akane moved over to help comfort Nabiki.</p><p>"There's always things you would do differently if you could," Ranma said softly, paraphrasing Kasumi.</p><p>"It wasn't your fault," Akane added, mostly just to add her voice.</p><p>Akane was reminded of when Ranma broke down at school after seeming so recovered for a month. But certainly Nabiki had let it out to her support group. It just seemed that she managed to keep it in around everyone else.</p><p>Nabiki was still weeping when Kasumi walked out of the kitchen shortly, carrying a tea set. Nabiki was still crying heavily, her eyes puffy, but she turned around to see Kasumi.</p><p>"I...didn't mean to wake you," Nabiki said hesitantly.</p><p>"It is quite all right," Kasumi said quietly. "Please sit down, it sounds like you could all use something to calm your nerves." She sat down and poured everyone a cup of tea. She took her own cup and sipped at it yawning.</p><p>"There's nothing in it?" Ranma asked hesitantly. Kasumi shook her head and smiled briefly.</p><p>"It's just instant tea," Kasumi said with a little self-reproach. She really didn't feel up to making a good tea at the moment.</p><p>"You want to know why we're home so early?" Nabiki asked, sniffing. She sat down on the floor around the tea set, with a little steadying help from Ryouga, and shakily took up a cup of tea to sip at it.</p><p>"Perhaps later," Kasumi said. "Right now let's just share a cup of tea, and then some of us can get their needed sleep."</p><p>"The Kasumi cure-all," Nabiki laughed, half-hysterical. Ryouga sat down next to her, watching Nabiki nervously. Her shoulders were still shivering, and she seemed on the verge of crying again. Akane sat down next to Kasumi and Ranma, as usual, sat in her lap, both watching Nabiki.</p><p>"You don't want to be like me, Ranma," Nabiki said after about five minutes of silent drinking. "I'm a coward."</p><p>"That's why you faced off against the Amazon's," Ryouga reminded her. "Humiliated Shampoo in fact."</p><p>"It doesn't change the basic fact," Nabiki said quietly. "The Ice Queen is a coward. And soon everyone is going to know it." She set down her teacup and started crying again. Soft, silent sobbing this time.</p><p>"You're exhausted," Kasumi said. She arched an eyebrow as Nabiki leaned her face into Ryouga's shoulder.</p><p>"Yeah, Nabiki," Akane agreed. "You'll think better after some sleep." Ranma shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>"You're telling people on your will," Ranma said. She paused and smirked before continuing quietly. "And if you keep counting on the Ice Queen bit this'll just keep happening." Nabiki's crying was broken by several laughs.</p><p>"I should charge you for that, Saotome," Nabiki said shakily. She closed her eyes, her shoulders still shaking. "My shoulder hurts, damn it." In the next moment she seemed to relax all at once and started breathing deeply.</p><p>"I was hoping she'd fall asleep soon," Kasumi said, sounding tired herself. "Hibiki-san could you perhaps carry her to her bed."</p><p>"Ummm, okay," Ryouga said nervously. Noticing that he still wasn't "Ryouga" or "Ryouga-kun" again. He cautiously picked Nabiki up, blushing as her good arm wrapped around him, as he stood up and almost started to walk.</p><p>"I shall show you the way," Kasumi said, beating Akane and Ranma to the protest. She stood up and started to lead Ryouga away, but turned back to face Akane and Ranma. "And then I'm going back to bed as well." She smiled. "As per instructions. You shall be fine?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said.</p><p>"We can handle things today," Akane said.</p><p>~Probably better than I at the moment,~ Kasumi thought. ~Why didn't I see this coming? And is encouraging 'P-Chan' another mistake?~ She looked at Ryouga briefly and how tenderly he was holding her sister. ~Perhaps that one is not.~ "Hibiki-san, follow me."</p><p>"Hai," Ryouga said nervously.</p><p>"Is it true?"</p><p>Kodachi looked up from her lunch to face the girl that had asked the question. She was being remarkably brave. There was no way that she would have dared approach Kodachi if it weren't for the burns that made fighting or more or less impossible.</p><p>That was as it should have been. She could focus on her studies, and no one would bother her. Eventually the noise of the other students would fade into the background. Merely the buzzing of hornets, or the hum of an air conditioner. The solitude reminded her of...</p><p>Kodachi was about to answer but froze, her words catching in her throat. Quiet. Alone. Empty. Dead.</p><p>"Kuno-sempai?" the girl asked. Kodachi laughed snickered at that.</p><p>"I am nearly seventeen," Kodachi said softly. "But I am still in the lowest class rank."</p><p>"Oh, are you okay?" the girl asked cautiously.</p><p>"I just realized something," Kodachi said. "What are you asking about?"</p><p>"About your brother attacking..." the girl started to explain.</p><p>"I have no brother," Kodachi answered firmly. The girl winced.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said quietly and started to turn to leave.</p><p>"Please wait," Kodachi called out. "I apologize. That is a touchy subject right now, and it is not something I wish to discuss."</p><p>"Oh, I see," the girl said, uncertain of what to do. Kodachi was well known to be unpredictable. "They're saying he was eaten by something right?" Kodachi frowned.</p><p>"Is there anything else we can talk about?" Kodachi said, picking at her lunch. Bending her arms seemed to hurt worse now, but it was the pain produced by stretching new skin. Her arms were healing.</p><p>"You actually want to talk to me?" the girl asked, wary.</p><p>"Quite suddenly I would not mind talking to anybody," Kodachi said. "The school was feeling like home just a moment ago."</p><p>"That's a bad thing?" the girl asked confused.</p><p>"Home is de..." Kodachi stopped herself and released a frustrated sigh. "I am keeping you from your lunch, my apologies again. Please return to your meal, do not worry about me." Kodachi turned back to her own lunch.</p><p>"All right," the girl said. She walked quickly back to her seat to eat her lunch.</p><p>"Well?" one of the other girls asked. "What did she say?"</p><p>"She said she didn't want to talk about it," the girl shrugged. "And that she didn't have a brother. She seems depressed."</p><p>"Doesn't surprise me," somebody said. "You know when they found her collapsed in the locker room last year? I heard she took something to kill herself."</p><p>"Her?" somebody scoffed. "Why would she want to kill herself?"</p><p>"Oh you know how those old money, samurai types get," another said. "Everything has to be so dramatic, it was probably just some attention getting stunt. What does someone like her know about hard times?"</p><p>"We really should get started on something," Akane said.</p><p>"Mm hmm," Ranma agreed quietly. Neither of them moved to do anything though. Nabiki and Kasumi were still asleep. So, other than the occasional appearance from "Charlotte," they were alone. And they were still sitting against the couch where they had settled that morning.</p><p>Ranma had been mostly quiet since Nabiki was taken to bed. She just seemed to want to sit curled up in Akane's lap and be held. The attitude was driving Akane crazy.</p><p>"Don't worry," Akane whispered, hugging Ranma. "Everything's going to be fine."</p><p>"I'm leaning too hard on people," Ranma said quietly. The knock on the door cut off any response Akane might have had. Ranma reluctantly stood up.</p><p>"I'll get it," Akane said, standing up next Ranma.</p><p>"Nah," Ranma said, shrugging. "I got it, besides, it's probably just Ryouga." At which point Ryouga wandered down the stairs and into the ground floor hallway.</p><p>"How many floors does this house have?" he muttered to himself. Akane and Ranma watched for a moment and turned to each other. Whoever was at the door knocked again.</p><p>"I..." Ranma hesitated.</p><p>"Why don't you make sure Ryouga doesn't get really lost," Akane suggested. Ranma looked at her.</p><p>"That's hiding again," Ranma said. "I'll get the door." Akane kissed her on the forehead after a moment's hesitation and Ranma went to the door.</p><p>The door opened on a nervous looking pair of students in Furinkan uniforms. Ranma immediately felt like they were dissecting her.</p><p>"Can I help you with anything?" Ranma asked, wanting to close the door already. "Or did you just come to stare at me?" They glanced about in embarrassment avoiding her face. Ranma growled and started to close the door.</p><p>"Wait!" one of them said.</p><p>"What?" Ranma demanded.</p><p>"We just came to..." the boy hesitated. "To say thank you." Ranma stopped shutting the door.</p><p>"Thank you?" she repeated.</p><p>"You saved us from some muggers once," the girl said.</p><p>"Oh," Ranma said, shrugging. "You're welcome, I guess."</p><p>"A lot of people are glad you're around," the boy said. "Some of the jocks were out of control before you got here."</p><p>"You saw what was going on with Akane," the girl pointed out. "Can you imagine what would have happened if they had..." she gasped and covered her mouth as she noticed Ranma turning pale. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean..."</p><p>"Who is it, Ranma," Akane asked coming up behind. "Ranma?" She noted the grip Ranma was giving the door and gently encouraged her to hold her hand instead. She gave a quiet squeeze back and she could feel Ranma calming down somewhat.</p><p>"It's our fault," the girl said.</p><p>"Yeah, we should leave," her boyfriend agreed.</p><p>"Thanks for comin' round," Ranma said before they left.</p><p>"It was the least we could do," the girl said before they continued toward the gate.</p><p>"What did they say?" Akane asked seriously as they left the gate.</p><p>"They were saying thank you," Ranma said. She looked to Akane, biting her lip and looked the other girl up and down a moment. "They said I kept 'em from getting' mugged."</p><p>"That's what's got you so scared?" Akane asked, brushing Ranma's bangs away from her face.</p><p>"Akane?" Ranma asked hesitantly.</p><p>"What is it Ranma?" Akane asked nervously.</p><p>"Would you accept training from me?" Ranma sounded really nervous about the question. Akane relaxed immediately.</p><p>"Of course I would," Akane answered, and the redhead suddenly looked as if a load on her back had been lightened.</p><p>"Thank you, Akane," Ranma whispered as they walked back into the house.</p><p>The phone rang as they passed it. Akane glanced at Ranma and picked up the phone cautiously.</p><p>"Hello?" she said into the receiver. She turned an angry red and hung up the phone a moment later. "Jerk."</p><p>"That was about me right?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"It doesn't matter," Akane hugged her close. "It's just one idiot." Ranma nodded, looking angry herself.</p><p>"I'm gonna make somethin' for lunch," she said.</p><p>"Do you want help with that," Akane asked, not noticing Ranma's wince at that suggestion.</p><p>Kodachi dodged aside as the egg came at her. She turned to glare at the offending party and silently wished she knew more about unarmed techniques than she did. There was some hesitation from the small group of boys, each wearing some sort of animal mask, before they tossed about five more eggs. It was just as easy to dodge those, maybe a little more so since she actually saw them coming.</p><p>"Excuse me," Kodachi said. "What do you think you are doing?" She took a step towards them and they broke and ran. "Pathetic." She snarled and shook her head as she walked the last block to the dojo.</p><p>"Tadaima," she called out as she entered the genkan. She had to remind herself to do so. She wasn't used to living in a place with other people yet.</p><p>Kodachi was passing the phone when she noticed the light indicating an incoming call. Oddly enough there was no ringing sound to indicate the call. If she hadn't been planning on using the phone anyway she probably wouldn't have noticed the call. She considered the boys outside that had tried to hit her with the eggs and frowned before she picked up the phone and grimaced as she bent her arm to hold it to her head.</p><p>"Tendo residence," she said coolly. "Did you come up with that taunt on your own? Or perhaps you subcontracted?" Kodachi hung up the phone with a sneer of disgust. She picked the phone up again and dialed.</p><p>"There've been a lot of calls since lunch." Kodachi turned to see Ryouga. "Some people came to visit too, they were okay, but they apparently stopped coming."</p><p>"I can explain that, there was a group of boys tossing eggs a block from..." Kodachi turned her attention to phone. "Yes, the estate? Tomorrow?" She grimaced. "Fine. Oh yes, that advertisement. Have the papers run it. Yes, I am certain, thank you." She released her breath as she straightened her arm and hung the phone up.</p><p>"Who was that?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"My lawyer," Kodachi said.</p><p>"You have a lawyer?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"You think I could run the Kuno fortune, attend school, train and," she paused and frowned upon remembering her garden was destroyed. "Do other things all on my own?"</p><p>"Good point," Ryouga said, embarrassed.</p><p>"What happened today," Kodachi asked worried.</p><p>"Didn't you hear?" Ryouga asked. Kodachi shook her head and frowned deeper. When Ryouga was finished summarizing the day's events she was almost livid.</p><p>"He did what?" Kodachi demanded before turning back to the phone.</p><p>Ranma came to rest across the dojo, breaking contact to get a good look at Akane. Neither of them were even breathing hard. Akane wasn't pushing herself at all. Ranma sighed dejectedly and relaxed from ready stance. It was almost an imperceptible change, Ranma's ready stance being more a matter of attitude than position.</p><p>"I can't figure out where you are you if you don't come at me," Ranma said quietly. Akane's attitude didn't really shift as she dropped out of the physical stance. Ranma frowned.</p><p>"Are you sure you're okay, Ranma?" Akane asked moving over to stand next to Ranma. "You've been acting funny since those first two stopped by." She leaned worriedly over Ranma and brushed at her cheek.</p><p>"I'm fine," Ranma said and then looked down. "Akane, I'm gonna try this again." She shuffled nervously.</p><p>"Okay," Akane said, nervous about Ranma's attitude. "Are you going to do something different this time."</p><p>"Yeeeah," Ranma said hesitantly. ~She needs to be better.~</p><p>Kasumi glided down the stairs and smiled at Kodachi and Ryouga watching the television. Kodachi was acting like it was the first time she had ever watched television. Kasumi was wondering if that might not be the case.</p><p>Kasumi's pleasant expression faded as she looked about the genkan. It was by no means filthy, but she usually kept it in much better condition. Actually, she couldn't remember the last time she had straightened up the genkan.</p><p>She sighed in frustration. The point of keeping things in constant order was so that it was never a big job. She wondered if the number of little things she had neglected already equaled that big job. She started to look over the entryway to see where it needed dusting or polishing, and noted the phone.</p><p>"What did you say this was called?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Gundam Wing," Ryouga said. "I think it's a rerun." He wasn't entirely certain of that, but he was fairly certain that he had seen it somewhere before. If he could find the TV when he wanted more often he could have been sure.</p><p>"Are you aware that the ringer on the phone has been turned off?" Kasumi asked as she looked into the living room.</p><p>"Someone's been calling the house," Ryouga said. Kodachi's rapt attention was on the screen. Ryouga was somewhat confused at the attention she was giving the screen. After all, there were no fights or anything going on. It was just that circus guy moaning listlessly about his Amnesia.</p><p>"You mean prank calls," Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Yeah, Akane turned the ringer off," Ryouga said.</p><p>"Is it a different caller each time?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"I answered a couple of times," Ryouga said. "I think it was the same person. They're tying up the phone line though."</p><p>"Ah, thank you," Kasumi said. She walked back to the phone and picked it up. "Hello, Tendo residence. Takeo-chan, is that you?" She blinked as the phone clicked to a dial tone, and then dialed. "Ichino-san, hello. Yes, it has been difficult, but Ranma is doing better. Is Takeo there? He is visiting friends? Oh, then I suppose I'll have to talk to you about this."</p><p>"Why'd you hang up?" one of the three kids asked. "Don't worry about threats, how are they going to figure out who's calling."</p><p>"That was Kasumi," Takeo said, pale. "She used to babysit me."</p><p>"So," the third said nervously. "She couldn't have known that was you." She continued in a small voice. "Could she?"</p><p>"I can't believe I said that to Kasumi," Takeo said.</p><p>"Are you guys beginning to think this was a bad idea?" the other guy asked. "I mean what if Ranma was really raped."</p><p>"You don't believe that," the girl said. "Do you, Kenichi? This is Ranma we're talking about."</p><p>"And Akane, Nabiki, Ukyou, Kasumi, Ryouga, Sayuri, Yuka, Hiroshi, Daisuke, and maybe even Kodachi," Takeo said. "Do you think all of them are lying, Seki?"</p><p>"She got my sister fire..." Seki was interrupted as the phone rang in Takeo's hands. The three of them stared at it as it rang again. The second ring was cut off as someone downstairs picked it up. Takeo picked up the phone carefully again and the three of them listened at the receiver.</p><p>"It's my mom," Takeo whispered to the others. The three of them winced at the next thing they heard on the receiver. "Hey Mom." The other two backed away and watched him cringing against the phone with a sort of morbid fascination. At least until Kenichi's mother slammed open the door.</p><p>"I need to talk to you," she said firmly. She turned to Seki. "I think you should go home."</p><p>"Okay, Mom," Takeo said meekly and winced again before hanging the phone up. "Yeah, she's coming to pick me up." Kenichi's mother nodded. She took the phone from him and started dialing, looking down at them.</p><p>"I really can't believe you children," she said angrily.</p><p>The phone rang again.</p><p>"Hello?" Kasumi said into the receiver. "Yes, thank you. No, that will be quite all right. Thank you anyway, but for now it would be enough for them not to make any more calls. Thank you."</p><p>She sighed in relief and hung up the phone. The sound of someone walking towards the house out of the dojo attracted her attention and she looked down the hallway.</p><p>"Akane, are you hurt?" Kasumi asked as she saw Akane leaning on Ranma. She immediately left the phone and rushed to check on her sister.</p><p>"What?" Ryouga said anxiously. He turned immediately to look towards the hallway and took in the situation. Akane limping along, leaning heavily on the smaller girl.</p><p>"Is it serious?" Kodachi asked, ripping her eyes and ears away from the Gundam Wing credits.</p><p>Ryouga almost fell into old habits and started yelling at Ranma for attacking Akane. He clearly caught a look at their faces before he could though. Akane seemed radiantly happy, while Ranma's expression looked like it belonged on Akane.</p><p>"What happened?" Ryouga demanded. He and Kodachi joined Kasumi to check on Akane's state.</p><p>"I just twisted my ankle," Akane said, waving off their concern. Ranma helped her sit down on the couch and then sat next to her. She stared down at the ground and held her hands in her lap.</p><p>"You are certain you do not need anything?" Kodachi asked. Akane nodded happily.</p><p>"Kodachi, I'm fine," Akane insisted. "I'll be better in no time."</p><p>"You actually sparred Akane for real?" Ryouga asked in shock. Ranma winced and shrunk in on herself.</p><p>"He actually took me seriously," Akane said. "It was a real spar. I was so busy trying to defend I couldn't get a shot in." Ranma silently nodded in agreement. Akane scooted closer to Ranma and kissed her on the cheek. "Thank you." Ranma smiled slightly and allowed herself to be hugged before standing back up again.</p><p>"I need ta make dinner I guess," Ranma said.</p><p>"I can do that Ranma," Kasumi said. "Perhaps you can see if Nabiki is feeling up to eating dinner?"</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma shrugged. "Okay."</p><p>"Don't try too hard to wake her up," Kasumi said. Ranma nodded and walked upstairs. Kasumi almost grimaced at what she was about to say. "Akane can you help me in the kitchen?"</p><p>"Sure!" Akane said after a little surprised hesitation. Ryouga turned pale, Kodachi merely shrugged. She had heard of Akane's cooking, but surely it was not so bad as the rumors made out.</p><p>"I don't know what got him started, Kasumi," Akane shrugged as she looked for the ingredients Kasumi was asking for. "Is this the vinegar?"</p><p>"No," Kasumi said looking. "That is vegetable oil. The vinegar is in a bottle with a green label."</p><p>"Oh, okay," Akane said looking back into the closet. "Actually, I think something scared him. Like he's worried he won't be ready if someone tries to do that again." Kasumi glanced at her sister and arched an eyebrow. "Is this it?"</p><p>"That is soy sauce," Kasumi said. "You need a bottle about the size of the vegetable oil with a green label." Akane nodded and started looking again. "About the spar, Akane."</p><p>"Uh huh?" she responded.</p><p>"Did you make any attacks?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"No," Akane said cheerfully. "I was too busy trying to avoid the attacks coming in."</p><p>"Did you try to attack," Kasumi reiterated. Akane paused and looked at her older sister.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Akane asked. "I already said I had no openings, if I tried I would have been open too long." She didn't think of that first, useless round.</p><p>"That's okay then," Kasumi said. "That's the vinegar."</p><p>"That bottle's not green," Akane protested. "It's gray." Kasumi blinked at her and looked at the dull green label. She picked up the vegetable oil that Akane had set to the side.</p><p>"What color is this?" she asked, pointing at the pale yellow label.</p><p>"White," Akane said a little offended at the question. Kasumi set down the vinegar and clapped her hands together, looking to the ceiling in what appeared to be an expression of thankfulness. "Kasumi are you okay?"</p><p>"Yes," Kasumi said, in the voice of someone who has finally found two pieces that match in jigsaw puzzle. "I think I needed a small victory."</p><p>"A victory over what?" Akane asked.</p><p>"You remember what I've told you about color-coding," Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Yeah," Akane said.</p><p>"Ignore it for now," Kasumi said. "Take the time to read the labels." Akane blinked in surprise.</p><p>"Nabiki's not waking..." Ranma stopped and stared as she saw Akane in the kitchen.</p><p>"Is something wrong Ranma?" Akane asked, worried about the nervous look on her wife's face.</p><p>"No," Ranma whimpered. Akane looked at her doubtfully.</p><p>"You didn't answer the phone did you?" Akane asked. Ranma shook her head and looked down.</p><p>"Ranma, do you still want to help?" Kasumi asked. She could talk to Akane, and maybe Nabiki, about the problem later.</p><p>"Yeah, sure," she said.</p><p>"Why don't you and Akane prepare the salad," she suggested.</p><p>"That sounds like fun," Akane said.</p><p>"You're slicing too hard," Ranma said, a few moments into slicing the lettuce. "You're cutting into the board underneath, see."</p><p>"Oh," Akane said, surprised mostly at Ranma correcting her without insulting her. She realized she shouldn't have been, Ranma hadn't been very insulting to anyone but herself of late. "So how am I supposed to cut it?"</p><p>"Here," Ranma took hold the knife and slipped in front of Akane. "Hold the knife."</p><p>"You want me to take the knife from you?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Nah," Ranma said. "Just hold it over my hand."</p><p>"Like this?" she asked, gripping over Ranma's hand lightly. She had to get right behind Ranma to do it, putting the redhead between her and the counter. The slight shiver Akane felt from Ranma told her Ranma had noticed the almost trapped position she was in as well. "Are you sure you're okay, Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said quietly. "Just let me get started cutting here." She started slicing through the head of lettuce, guiding both the knife and Akane's hand. "See its like fightin'. Speed and power are nice, but not if you're wild. Get accurate first."</p><p>"I think I see," Akane said, actually paying more attention to Ranma. With the side effect of not stressing about the preparation of the food for once. She kissed the back of Ranma's head as she felt the tension start to ease away.</p><p>Kasumi glanced over from the entrée to watch them and smiled. Successes indeed were a little more invigorating than simple rest.</p><p>"My home shall be ready for habitation tomorrow," Kodachi said suddenly.</p><p>"Can you take care of yourself?" Kasumi asked indicating Kodachi's arms.</p><p>"Well enough," Kodachi said. "I believe that I should return, considering the circumstances."</p><p>"What 'circumstances' are you talking about?" Akane asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>"Certainly it is in poor taste for me to ask you for hospitality," Kodachi said. "With what happened."</p><p>"What, because of your loon of a father?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You are welcome here, Kodachi," Kasumi said. "I don't believe anyone here blames you for a desperate man's action."</p><p>"I did promise the Kuno clan would serve Ranma and his family," Kodachi said. "We have not done a very good job as of yet." Akane kept silent on the matter.</p><p>"You have done quite well actually," Kasumi said.</p><p>"Yeah," Ryouga agreed quietly, remembering Kodachi's second phone call. "Really."</p><p>"And again you are not responsible for your father's actions," Kasumi continued, glancing at Ryouga.</p><p>"Yeah, he's a loon," Ranma said. She said the word without the element of dismissal that used to accompany it. Loons could be dangerous.</p><p>"Well, thank you Kasumi-san, Ranma," Kodachi said. "But I must oversee the estate as well, and I would like to start a new rose garden."</p><p>"We'll help you move back," Akane said. Ranma flinched in Akane's lap. "If that's okay."</p><p>"Thank you Akane-san," Kodachi said, smiling. The phone rang and everybody froze.</p><p>"I thought I turned the ringer off," Akane said.</p><p>"You did," Kasumi said, standing up. "I turned it back on. After speaking to the parents of the prank callers." She walked to phone. "Hello? Oh. One moment."</p><p>"Who is it?" Ranma asked nervously.</p><p>"It's a newspaper," Kasumi said. "Do you want to..." Ranma shook her head firmly. "All right, I'll tell them that."</p><p>"Great, now it's news," Ranma whispered. Akane rubbed her shoulders and kissed her cheek.</p><p>"It'll be all right," Akane said. "I'll be right here."</p><p>Nabiki snapped awake gasping. First in response to the nightmare that had woken her up, and then from the pain of jarring her shoulder. The second brought her back to reality.</p><p>"I'm still dressed for..." Nabiki grimaced as she remembered why she was still in her school clothes. "I can't believe I did that." She leaned on her good arm for a moment and settled herself down.</p><p>Obviously she had been more tired than she had originally thought. She lay back down on the bed and tired to let sleep come back over her. Instead of approaching sleep, she found herself staring at the pillow on top of her head and shivering underneath a thick blanket. She sat up again and let out a long breath.</p><p>"I need to sleep," Nabiki reminded herself, holding a pillow tightly in front of her. She glanced about her darkened room cautiously. It felt quite large when she couldn't see the walls, as if it could go one forever and hide anything or anyone.</p><p>Ryouga stretched awake and yawned. Then he went about the morning ritual of figuring out where he was. The answer was simple, the Tendo dojo, after all, Kasumi had led him back there when dinner ended after all. A quick glance around proved that.</p><p>Yep, weights, fold-up mats. There was a water bucket over there. Better avoid that part of the room. Where did those things always come from anyway? Blankets and pillows piled in the corner. Bo-staves. Ryouga paused and squinted in confusion.</p><p>"Blankets and pillows?" Ryouga repeated to himself.</p><p>He glanced about a second time, eventually finding the right corner of the room again.</p><p>"That wasn't there last night. I don't think so anyway." On a second glance it looked less like a haphazard pile of bedding than...something else.</p><p>He stood up and walked to the corner, careful to keep it in sight. Getting closer he could clearly see a hand holding down one of the pillows. Ryouga grimaced as he recognized that whoever it was had slept leaning on that arm, by now it was going to be rather numb.</p><p>Ryouga cautiously reached over to try turn the girl over on her back, and free up the blood flow to the arm again. He was pretty certain of who it was, especially with the outline of an arm in a sling under the blankets. The thought was confirmed as soon as he tried to move her.</p><p>"No!" Nabiki's muffled voice gasped, she sat up quickly and looked nervously in Ryouga's direction.</p><p>She was backing into the corner and staring at him when she recognized Ryouga. The behavior turned a knife in Ryouga's gut. To see Nabiki acting like that.</p><p>"Ryouga," she breathed in relief. Then she continued in her regular dry tone. "What are you doing?"</p><p>"Nothing!" Ryouga said instantly. "Just...you're laying on your arm." Nabiki looked at her good arm and frowned, noticing it was numb.</p><p>"Great," she muttered tiredly. "One good arm and the floor puts it to sleep." She started flexing her hand to get the blood moving.</p><p>"Do you need help?" Ryouga asked, still nervous about finding Nabiki asleep in the same room as him. She narrowed her eyes at the suggestion.</p><p>"It's just asleep," she said. Nabiki gathered up her bedding and stood up stiffly. She almost glared at Ryouga sitting in front of her. Ryouga returned the look, confused for a moment.</p><p>"Oh," he said, then laughed nervously as he stood up and quickly backed away from the corner.</p><p>"Afraid of something?" she asked, sounding amused. Nabiki walked past him, back into the house. He watched her go in curiosity and concern. She seemed to be acting normal. If you ignored the fact that she had come to the dojo to sleep.</p><p>Kodachi took a glance at the newspaper personals before she walked out of the Tendo dojo.</p><p>"Kuno Kodachi, daughter of Kuno Chikako, formerly of the Hibiki clan, seeks contact with her mother's family." It was followed by her address and telephone number. She set the paper down and nodded in satisfaction. Then she walked out the door.</p><p>Kodachi frowned as she noted an extra car upon walking out of the Tendo dojo. She frowned deeper as one of the car doors opened and somebody approached her.</p><p>"Saotome Ranma?" the reporter asked.</p><p>"Kuno Kodachi," she corrected sharply. "I have to be lea..."</p><p>"Any relation to the principal of Furinkan High?" the man asked.</p><p>"The man is unfortunately my father," Kodachi admitted. "And, no, I do not approve." She glanced to the nearest rooftop and leaped upward. "Good day." Then she continued along other rooftops, heading for school.</p><p>"School walk out," Nabiki read out loud, ignoring the odd looks she was getting for being more or less awake already. "Staff and students protest episodes of sexual harassment."</p><p>"Harassment," Akane repeated angrily. "That's what they call it?"</p><p>"If it weren't for the strike and the walkout," Nabiki said bitterly. "They'd probably ignore it, but people want to know what's happening."</p><p>"What's the article say?" Ranma asked quietly.</p><p>"The students and much of the staff of Furinkan High in the Nerima Ward walked out following a brief altercation between the Principal, three students and a teacher," Nabiki read. "The teachers stated their reasons that the Principal had been running an unsafe school."</p><p>"That's an understatement," Akane said. Ranma nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Several teachers mention times when the principal has directly endangered the lives of the students," Nabiki continued. "Even one of the newest teachers, Ninomiya Hinako indicated a level of dangerous level of delinquency among the athletes, and implied the existence of multiple victims of some sort of sexual harassment." Nabiki frowned.</p><p>"Something wrong with that statement?" Kasumi asked as she noted Nabiki's expression.</p><p>"They wouldn't have said multiple if Hinako wasn't adamant on that," Nabiki said, a catch in her throat. She glanced at Ranma looking honestly shocked. "We might not be the only ones."</p><p>"But it says harassment," Ranma said hesitantly.</p><p>"Ranma," Nabiki said sharply. "The article says you were expelled over an 'inappropriate relationship' with a 'prominent member of the kendo team,' and that you accused the athlete of making 'improper advances.'"</p><p>"What?" Ranma snapped in disbelief.</p><p>"They put it on the front page of the local paper," Nabiki said. "But even then most of the story is page five. We're an embarrassment!" Ranma looked at her for a moment and shifted uncomfortably in Akane's lap.</p><p>"I'm gonna be in the dojo," Ranma said, clenching her fists. She stood up and walked stiffly to the corridor.</p><p>"I'll come with you," Akane said, following behind her quickly. Ranma froze for a moment, but nodded and continued on.</p><p>"You really think there might be others," Ryouga asked. Nabiki shook her head.</p><p>"I don't know," she said, not sounding enraged any longer. It was more like, guilt really. Ryouga was confused at that. "I thought I knew everything about Furinkan." Guilt and something else. Ryouga hesitantly reached out to lay a hand on Nabiki's shoulder, checking Kasumi's expression first. Nabiki flinched at the unexpected touch and glanced at Ryouga.</p><p>"It'll be all right," he assured her. Nabiki stopped herself from denying the need to be comforted. Considering what happened yesterday, a denial would just put her in a weaker position.</p><p>"Thanks, Ryouga," she said, sighing. Kasumi refilled Nabiki's teacup drawing a somewhat exasperated glance from the girl.</p><p>"Are you Ranma Saotome?" a man asked before they'd gotten half a block from the dojo.</p><p>"Are you a reporter?" Ranma asked. The man nodded and Ranma growled and turned away from him.</p><p>"Why in the world are you even here?" Akane asked. "I thought you people wanted to bury this story." She and Ranma walked past him.</p><p>"They won't print anything else with what we have," the reporter insisted, following them. "The staff are each giving extreme stories so we can't trust either side, and the police won't release any information. And yes, they do want to bury the story, but I think this is important."</p><p>"Leave me alone," Ranma said without turning around.</p><p>"Ninomiya-san said there were five victims including you," the reporter said. Ranma stopped and looked down, Akane turned to look at him, shocked.</p><p>"Five?" She asked. "Hinako-sensei said that?" The man nodded.</p><p>"You don't have to talk to him, Ranma," Akane said. Ranma nodded and continued walking along, holding Akane's hand.</p><p>"Do you want them to just sweep this under the rug?" the reporter asked.</p><p>"Just turn around and leave," Ryouga said crushing a fair sized rock in his hand and then turning quickly so as not to lose sight of Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"Where are they going?" Nabiki asked Kasumi, indicating where Akane, Ranma, and Ryouga had left saying they'd be right back.</p><p>"They've finished fixing Kodachi's house," Kasumi explained. "We're going to help her move back in." Nabiki stared at her for a moment.</p><p>"I'm staying home," Kasumi said reassuringly, noting Nabiki's surprised expression. Nabiki shook her head.</p><p>"That's not it," Nabiki said. "Ranma's going with you?"</p><p>"Yes," Kasumi said. "Is that a problem?"</p><p>"They're taking Ranma," she said, emphasizing the name. "To the Kuno Estate."</p><p>"Oh my," Kasumi said. "I had not considered that." Kasumi stood up and moved to the door. "They're already gone."</p><p>"I guess if there's a problem they'll come back," Nabiki said.</p><p>Ranma stopped outside the gates to the Kuno estate and stared up in terror. She gripped Akane's hand tightly and took a step backwards. The redhead bit her lip and shook her head.</p><p>"Akane," Ranma said shakily.</p><p>"Is something wrong Ranma?" Akane asked, turning to face her.</p><p>"I can't go in there," she said looking up at the Kuno gates.</p><p>"Why n..." Akane started. "Oh. Oh. Ranma, I'm sorry, I didn't think."</p><p>"What's wrong," Ryouga asked, confused.</p><p>"It's nothing," Ranma said. "I just can't go into...that place. I'll wait outside."</p><p>"You're sure?" Akane asked. "You don't want me to walk you home or anything?" Ranma frowned and crossed her arms.</p><p>"I can protect myself," Ranma said, eyes focused sharply on Akane and avoiding looking at the Kuno estate. "And..." she glanced down at the ground in shame. "I can scr...yell if I need help."</p><p>"You're certain?" Akane asked. Ranma nodded, walked to the Kuno wall and sat down facing away from it.</p><p>"You should get in there," Ranma said. "Kodachi's gonna need help movin' stuff around."</p><p>"If you're okay," Akane said. Ranma nodded again. "All right, call us if you need anything."</p><p>"Right," Ranma said, looking up and down the street. She still didn't look at the building she was sitting against. Akane hesitantly turned away from her and led Ryouga into the building.</p><p>"Why's Ranma staying outside," Ryouga asked as they entered the estate, whispering.</p><p>"This is where it happened," Akane answered under her breath. "You know. It." Ryouga stopped and looked around the courtyard with a new perception.</p><p>"I didn't think of that," Ryouga said.</p><p>"Neither did I," Akane added, berating herself. Ryouga glanced at her and would have said something if Kodachi hadn't stepped out of the building.</p><p>"Akane-san, Ryouga," Kodachi said, she looked around. "Ranma is not here?"</p><p>"He's outside," Akane said. "He felt uncomfortable about coming inside."</p><p>"Yes," Kodachi answered. "I suppose she would." She sighed and looked down, then shook her head. "Well, this should not take too long. I only have the bare minimum of furniture required, most of the rooms shall be empty for now. Ryouga, if you could stay with me, I do not think Nabiki-san would appreciate it if I lost you." Akane and Kodachi smirked as Ryouga blushed.</p><p>"Five," Ranma said quietly. "Why am I the only one everybody found out about?"</p><p>Ranma pulled her legs up and hugged herself. She didn't like where things were heading. She hadn't liked the attention she was getting before all this happened. Now it was like a constant bombardment of looks and questions. It was like fate wanted to make her some sort of spokesperson...or sideshow freak.</p><p>"Come look and see," Ranma muttered. "A lifetime of martial arts training, this girl once killed a god, and she still couldn't protect herself." What was she worth anyway.</p><p>Most of her life had been spent only under the eye of her father, and only her father. The father that had left in the night when his son was emasculated.</p><p>Ranma sighed and looked briefly at the estate walls. Akane hadn't abandoned her. Actually a lot of people had stayed by her. But they couldn't know her as well as her father did, could they? Obviously, if her father had known her the longest time, that meant he knew her the best. That was right wasn't it? And he had abandoned her.</p><p>"Akane sees something in me," Ranma said. "I guess."</p><p>She glanced up at the people walking along the street and frowned as they glanced at her. Some of them probably recognized her, but she couldn't tell which. A lot of them were staring at her, for the fact that she was a loitering teenager if nothing else.</p><p>"Hey, look," somebody said. Ranma glanced at the group of boys, a group of jerks from her school. She had hoped they would just pass by without noticing her. "It's Ranma, we missed you yesterday."</p><p>"Go away," Ranma growled angrily, looking over her legs.</p><p>"What?" one of them said. "We just wanted to thank you for getting us out of school." They moved closer, seemingly unaware of what Ranma could do to them if she decided.</p><p>"Leave me alone" Ranma snapped irritably. ~I...don't want to hurt them that's all.~</p><p>"Yeah, no way any of us could have thought up this whole scheme," one them said. "Much less pull it off."</p><p>"Back off," Ranma warned again. She pulled in as tight as she could, feeling closed in. She'd seen this before, broken up scenes like it in passing. She'd never been subjected to it before. It said a lot about how she was projecting herself that they were doing it now, even knowing who she was. ~Please just go away.~</p><p>"You even got Akane out of it," one of them said.</p><p>"Does that make you a lesbian?" asked another.</p><p>"Fuck you," Ranma snapped angrily, trying to keep from crying. The Kuno Estate behind her, and the memories weighing down on her threatening to keep her paralyzed.</p><p>"Does that mean you're bi?" one of them laughed.</p><p>"Maybe Kuno just didn't do it for you?"</p><p>~Are you going to sit here a let them turn you into a victim again?~ Ranma demanded of herself. "No." She whispered</p><p>"No?" The speaker placed a hand on Ranma's shoulder, not noticing as the shaking in Ranma's frame vanished, much less the slight chill in the air.</p><p>"Get. Your. Fuckin'. Hand. Offa. Me." Ranma growled. She reached up and grabbed the hand, twisting it. "NOW!"</p><p>She continued twisting, driving him to the ground and giving his arm one good twisting yank that was accompanied by several cracks. She turned a glare on the other guys as she let go of the screaming boy. They grabbed their friend and ran. Something clattered to the ground as they ran.</p><p>"You damn jerks!" Ranma shouted after them. "You better hope I never see you trying that with anybody ever again!" He glared down at the mask that they had dropped in their flight, a stylish ceramic gorilla mask. She growled and clenched her fists staring after them fiercely.</p><p>"Hey," someone male said behind her. Ranma whirled around, lashing out with a fist.</p><p>"What happened to you?" Nabiki asked as Ryouga came in, sporting a small bruise and being virtually dragged by Kodachi. Nabiki took a moment to consider how much it took to actually hurt Ryouga.</p><p>"Ranma's stronger than she used to be," Ryouga said, grumbling.</p><p>"I said sorry," Ranma said, embarrassed.</p><p>"He's not mad at you, Ranma," Akane said, one arm comfortingly around Ranma's shoulders. "Are you?" Akane said glaring at Ryouga.</p><p>"Uhh...Of course not," Ryouga said.</p><p>"You hit Ryouga," Nabiki surmised.</p><p>"The fool came up behind her without announcing himself beforehand," Kodachi explained rolling her eyes.</p><p>"I was just seeing if she was all right," Ryouga said, sitting down. Ranma tensed at Ryouga's comment.</p><p>"Oh! Did something happen," Kasumi asked coming into the room. "Nabiki was concerned about you going to the Kuno estate." Nabiki winced.</p><p>"Nah, it wasn't that," Ranma said. She hesitated. "Well, sort of...I was waiting outside."</p><p>"Some boys," Akane said, almost spitting, "were harassing Ranma."</p><p>"Oh dear," Kasumi said. "Are you all right?"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Ranma nodded. "I took care of it."</p><p>"If you think Ryouga looks bad," Akane said smirking. "You should have seen one of the guys that Ranma ran off." Ranma smiled briefly, then frowned.</p><p>"Idiot shoulda known better than to grab me," Ranma said. "What did they think I was going to do? Just let 'em paw me?" She shivered.</p><p>"Are you sure you're okay?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"I'm goin' ta take a bath," Ranma said, walking in that direction, still holding Akane's hand. She turned to Nabiki and Kasumi. "I'm okay. I just need to relax." They nodded</p><p>"I think I need a bath too," Akane said.</p><p>"Yes, you do," Nabiki agreed, Akane gave her an annoyed look. Nabiki then pointed at Ryouga, "and he'll be right behind you two."</p><p>"Great, now I stink," Ryouga muttered.</p><p>"They knew who I was, and what I can do." Ranma said quietly, leaning back against Akane in the hot water. "And they still treated me like that."</p><p>"Ranma," Akane said. "You haven't been acting dangerous lately. People forget things if they're not reminded."</p><p>"I almost freaked out again," Ranma said. "I had time to prepare for...Him."</p><p>"You were fine Ranma," Akane assured her.</p><p>"I woulda been," she took a breath and continued in a rush. "I might as well have eaten another bowl of Shampoo's ramen if that had happened."</p><p>"It didn't happen," Akane reminded her. "You'd run them off before any of us got there."</p><p>"But I almost..." Ranma said.</p><p>"You were fine," Akane insisted. "The way that jerk's arm was hanging I say you'd broken it in three places."</p><p>"I crushed his hand and dislocated the shoulder too," Ranma said succinctly. "But what about next time."</p><p>"If you keep worrying about it," Akane whispered. She shook her head. "I mean, Ranma, you laid out Ryouga in a single punch."</p><p>"Uh, heh, I was lucky." Ranma lost some anxiety as embarrassed amusement replaced it. Then she shook out her hand with a little bit of a grimace. "And it hurt. But don't tell him that."</p><p>"Is that a little ego I hear?" Akane asked in amusement. She kissed Ranma on the cheek as the redhead smiled.</p><p>"Umm, Nabiki," Ryouga started, glancing toward the kitchen where Kasumi was, and towards Kodachi watching television until she felt it was time to go back to an empty house.</p><p>"What is it, Charlotte?" Nabiki asked dryly, setting her manga down so she could change the page. Ryouga flinched, but didn't let the name distract him.</p><p>"What were you doing in the dojo?" he asked.</p><p>"Sleeping," Nabiki answered, picking up her manga and starting to read it.</p><p>"Yeah but why?" Ryouga asked.</p><p>"Why does anybody sleep?" Nabiki asked, shrugging. "I was tired."</p><p>"No why were you sleeping in the..."</p><p>"Feeling better, Ranma?" Nabiki asked, glancing up from her manga for a moment. Ryouga turned around and saw Ranma and Akane walking into the room. He gave Nabiki a frustrated look, but didn't ask anything else.</p><p>"We're going out," Akane said. Nabiki noted that Ranma was not with her and glanced about. She found the redhead coming down the stairs and zipping up a light jacket. She arched an eyebrow and turned back to face Akane.</p><p>"Okay," Nabiki said, then turned back to the morning shows she usually had to miss for school.</p><p>"Do you want to come?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Where are you going?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Ucchan's, maybe a movie," Akane answered. "Might as well get some rest before we tackle that jerk."</p><p>"Be good to know what Ukyou is thinking about, too," Nabiki nodded.</p><p>"So are you coming?" Akane asked. "Kasumi wants to catch up on some of the cleaning, so she's staying."</p><p>"I think I'll stay," Nabiki said after a moment. "Talk to...Hinako. Just stay in all day."</p><p>"Okay," Akane said, shrugging. "Just me and Ranma then." She moved to join her spouse waiting nervously at the door.</p><p>"See you later," Ranma said, before they walked out. Nabiki considered Ranma's behavior. On the one hand she was comfortable enough that she wasn't virtually hanging off Akane or anybody else. One the other, she was obviously agitated.</p><p>"He's getting ready for something," Nabiki said. Whatever it was, Ranma didn't seem to want to deal with it. Which reminded her of something else.</p><p>A while later she stood up and looked back to the dojo, and then the television. Kasumi came into the room, carrying some light cleaning supplies.</p><p>"Excuse me, Nabiki," Kasumi said, cheerfully. "But I'm going to go over this room now."</p><p>"That's fine," Nabiki said. "Sorry if I'm in your way."</p><p>"Don't worry about it, Nabiki," Kasumi said, smiling. "It's pleasant to have someone else around the house during the day." She went to work as Nabiki left the room and glanced at the phone. She really did need to talk to Hinako. Before the teacher did something reckless. She almost went to the phone but sighed and walked down the corridor to the dojo instead.</p><p>"Listen, Ryouga," Nabiki said, walking into the dojo. She stopped and noted the camping materials neatly stacked against the wall where Ryouga had left the day before. "You idiot."</p><p>"Business looks good," Akane said.</p><p>"I'm open about twice as much," Ukyou said, exaggerating. "So word is spreading a little more."</p><p>"That's good," Ranma said. "No problems from..." He glanced at the rug that had been put over the blood stain that she and Konatsu were slowly working out.</p><p>"It's actually working for me," Ukyou said, not sounding particularly pleased.</p><p>"What?" Akane asked. "People are coming here because of that?"</p><p>"Weird," Ranma agreed.</p><p>"They're like vultures," Ukyou said angrily. "Just sitting around and waiting for an opportunity. I've got people coming in and asking about..." Her face shot up to look at Ranma and she stopped. "Anyway, it's really starting to bug me."</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said quietly glancing around. Some of the customers were looking at them.</p><p>"There was a reporter hanging around outside our place a couple days ago," Akane said. "He might still be around."</p><p>"If Mousse hadn't done all that," Ranma whispered.</p><p>"Damn, amazons," Ukyou agreed. "The only good thing about this is the whole Kuno mess."</p><p>"At least it wasn't one of us that did it," Akane said. Serving a table behind them, Konatsu tightened up.</p><p>"I guess it's good to have clean hands," Ukyou said, watching Akane.</p><p>"Are you okay Ukyou?" Akane asked confused. "You sound upset. Oh! I forgot it is you! I'm sorry Ukyou, I didn't mean to remind you about..." She glanced at the rug. Ukyou looked at Akane's honestly concerned face and relaxed.</p><p>"That's okay, sugar," Ukyou said. "I'm just a little wound up." Ranma sighed, unnoticed by the other two women, and slumped.</p><p>"Ucchan," Ranma said quietly. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"What for, Ranma?" Ukyou asked, watching him with her own cautious look as she handed a plate to Konatsu. "You didn't do anything."</p><p>"Yeah, I know," Ranma said.</p><p>Nabiki took a breath as the door closed behind Kasumi, Ranma and Akane. Ryouga still hadn't managed to return to pick up his stuff. Nabiki had moved his things into her room on the second day, to get it out of the dojo. It was in the way of Ranma and Akane's training after all.</p><p>She stared at the phone and tapped her fingers impatiently. She really needed to talk to Hinako. There was, of course, the school situation. She'd already missed more than half a week, she really didn't want to miss much more.</p><p>Misery loves company, and Nabiki wanted to know who else Hinako had seen. The problem was that talking to Hinako would pretty much close the book on her ability to keep from going public.</p><p>"You've already told Ranma," Nabiki reminded herself, trying to forget that Ranma had said she wasn't expecting Nabiki to step forward. It was certainly a case of easier said than done. ~This is what you insisted to stay home for.~</p><p>Nabiki grabbed the phone receiver, took a deep breath and picked up the phone. She dialed quickly.</p><p>"Hinako," Nabiki said after hearing the voice on the other end. "It's Nabiki, I just want to know what you and the other teachers are doing?"</p><p>"I hate this stuff," Ranma said, pulling up her pants. She sat down on the stool and pulled her legs up to rest on a support between to legs. She leaned forward and hugged around her knees.</p><p>"It's the only way we have," the doctor said apologetically. "When I was a girl it was all men doctors." Ranma stared at her and shivered.</p><p>"I couldn't do that," Ranma said.</p><p>"You don't have to," Inohara assured her. She took a breath and tossed the gloves in the trash. "You could have canceled the appointment. I expected you to, actually. You seem to be getting enough poking and prodding as it is."</p><p>"I just need ta know," Ranma said. "I mean, they told me that I could still...after I...when...you know."</p><p>"I understand, Ranma," Inohara said soothingly. "And you don't have to worry. The hospital didn't lie, you can still have children." Ranma gave deep sigh of relief.</p><p>"I never thought I'd want ta hear that," Ranma said quietly.</p><p>"Never wanted children before?" the doctor asked. The small talk was calming Ranma down a bit.</p><p>"Not like this," the redhead answered.</p><p>"No, I don't expect so," Inohara agreed, only half-right as to what she thought Ranma was talking about. She changed the subject. "I think it's time I met your's and Nabiki's family."</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said slipping off the stool and walking to the door. In the waiting room, Akane-kun and Kasumi.</p><p>"Hello," the doctor said, extending a hand to Kasumi. "I don't believe I've met you yet. I'm Doctor Inohara Nui, you must be Kasumi. Nabiki is tightlipped about her life, but she's mentioned you, and so has Ranma."</p><p>"Yes, Nabiki can be fairly reticent," Kasumi agreed. "You must be a good doctor for Nabiki to suggest you."</p><p>"I would hope so," Inohara said. "May I speak to you for a moment?" Kasumi exchanged a brief look with Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"Certainly," Kasumi said, and followed the doctor off to the side.</p><p>"I just want to ask about how Ranma is doing at home," the doctor said. "I did not get a chance to know her before."</p><p>"Well, Ranma is hard to describe," Kasumi said.</p><p>"I can tell, can you tell me if she's improving at all?" Inohara asked.</p><p>"Certainly," Kasumi said, before beginning to talk to the doctor in earnest. "Is there anything else?" She asked as the doctor seemed to be satisfied with the provided comments.</p><p>"Yes," Inohara said. "I'm having trouble finding Ranma's medical records, who was her last doctor."</p><p>"Dr. Ono Tofu," Kasumi said. "Our family doctor, but he has been on sabbatical for the last few months. I do not know before that."</p><p>"Do you know where she lived?" Inohara asked.</p><p>"On the road," Kasumi answered. "Ranma she has spent most of her life with her father to study the Art."</p><p>"So, she probably doesn't have a paper trail," Inohara said, Kasumi had mentioned Ranma's martial arts skills already. She had been surprised, and concerned, about that. The little she had seen of the girl hardly seemed like a highly skilled martial artist. "Well, I can try to track down your family doctor, but that's it a suppose. Thank you for taking the time to speak to me."</p><p>"That is perfectly all right," Kasumi said. "I have no problem with trying to help Ranma with...the situation."</p><p>"Any word of her parents?" Inohara asked.</p><p>"Not as of yet," Kasumi said. "If they followed Ranma's father there is a chance they do not have access to a telephone or such methods of communication. Ranma's mother limited her trip to two months however, and she only left two weeks ago."</p><p>"And the school situation?" Inohara asked. "I only know what they said in the article."</p><p>"She's dealing with it," Kasumi said. "She is more angry than depressed about the situation."</p><p>"Sorry to keep you here," Inohara said. "But I need to talk about somebody else now."</p><p>"Nabiki?" Kasumi guessed, the doctor nodded. "She is somewhat more difficult to pin down."</p><p>"I know," Inohara said. "What can you tell me about her behavior?"</p><p>"Well..." Kasumi started, taking a deep breath.</p><p>"Tadaima."</p><p>Nabiki heard the three voices and relaxed.</p><p>"Okaeri Nasai," she called back. They walked into the living room. "The prognosis the same as what the hospital said?"</p><p>"Yes," Ranma said, in obvious relief. "Did you talk to Hinako?"</p><p>"I did," Nabiki answered. The other three looked at her in surprise. Nabiki had been saying that she would call the teacher for the last couple of days now, but hadn't yet. "The hearing is set next Monday. She was getting ready to call us soon anyway."</p><p>"Why?" Akane asked.</p><p>"She wants us to testify," Nabiki said dryly. She sighed and continued in a quiet voice. "This is going to be a circus."</p><p>"I don't think Hinako would try to make a big deal about this," Akane said. "She acted fairly discreet so far."</p><p>"She's known all this time," Ranma said quietly.</p><p>"Hinako's just taking action," Nabiki said. "Somebody had to. Principal Kuno made it a circus when he expelled us."</p><p>"Are you okay, Nabiki?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Are you?" she asked in return.</p><p>"I don't know," Ranma said. "I don't think I'm going to have much choice."</p><p>"You don't have to testify," Akane reminded her. "Either of you."</p><p>"I have to," Ranma said. "Everybody already knows anyway."</p><p>"We both have to," Nabiki said. ~But can I?~</p><p>"What's she doing here?" Akane asked irritably as they sat down. Everybody else turned to see the girl from the theater sitting in a chair and glaring at them.</p><p>"I don't know," Nabiki said, wringing her hands. "They're more interesting." She dismissed the girl and turned her attention to a group of five boys, one of which had a cast wrapped around his arm.</p><p>"That's those jerks that wear the masks," Ranma said angrily.</p><p>"Aren't they the guys that were bugging you, Ranma?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said, tearing an angry glare away from them towards the Principal as he strutted down the aisle, wearing a conservative suit and a hat. Probably trying to cover the pineapple tree. He smiled in the direction of the Tendos and Saotomes and continued on to take his seat.</p><p>Kodachi came separately a few minutes later. Her father directed a betrayed expression in her direction, but she did pay attention to him.</p><p>"I am sorry to be late," Kodachi said.</p><p>"You aren't yet," Akane said. "They haven't started."</p><p>"Oh good," Kodachi said. "Then I have not missed a chance to provide aid."</p><p>"I am Saotome Ranma," Ranma said. It helped that most of people here had already heard her story. They were already dissecting her appearance and attitude. She really couldn't get more sideshow if she tried. And she was using the soul of ice again. For this, she would need it.</p><p>"Your student records say that Saotome Ranma is male," one of the board members said.</p><p>"I was born male," Ranma said quietly. They were probably the only people in the room that weren't all Nerimans who knew about Ranma. Certainly this was a topic Ranma was more used to</p><p>"So how is it that you are now a girl?" the board members asked.</p><p>"I have a shape-changing curse," Ranma explained. "It...it went crazy after...what happened. I can't change back yet."</p><p>"A curse?" someone said doubtfully. "You expect us to believe that?"</p><p>"We brought some pictures..." Ranma started. One of the board members shrugged.</p><p>"This could be your brother for all we know," one of them said.</p><p>"Excuse me," Akane called out standing up and walking to stand next Ranma.</p><p>"Akane, what are you doing?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You can't expect us to keep secrets while you do this," Akane said.</p><p>"Tendo-san?" a board member called out. "You have not yet been called."</p><p>"My name is Saotome," Akane said to a collection of startled gasps. "I took it when I married Ranma." There were disturbed looks from the board.</p><p>"What you say is impossible, miss," one of them said. "It is against the law for two women to marry in this country."</p><p>"I am just going to be up here long enough to set the curse matter to rest," she said, holding a small canteen.</p><p>"Your significant other," the speaker used an unfriendly amount humor, "has already said that she can't change back, what do you plan to do?" He was already jotting down mental instability on his pad.</p><p>Akane simply poured the water over herself, growing several inches and her figure definitely attaining a male figure. He shook the water out of his hair and extended arms with an expression of challenge on her face.</p><p>"Satisfied?" Akane asked. "Does this prove the curse? Or do you want me to drop my pants in both forms?" She asked the last angrily.</p><p>"No," someone said sweatdropping. "Just, how did this...affliction happen?"</p><p>"I got mine in China," Ranma explained quietly. "My father has a curse that turns him into a panda, someone else we know turns into a piglet."</p><p>"And what about your...spouse?" someone asked. "Is this affliction...contagious?" Suddenly there was a nervous murmur in the room.</p><p>"No, I gave myself the curse," Akane said. "For my own reasons."</p><p>"I see," one of the board said. "This does make the Principal's accusations seem less likely, you may sit down Tendo...I mean Saotome-san."</p><p>"Fine," Akane said, sitting down in an empty chair right behind Ranma.</p><p>"Saotome-san." The board turned their attention back to Ranma, who reminded herself that Akane and other friends were right behind her. "Your Principal claims that you seduced his son and then helped to kill him. You say you were raped?"</p><p>Ranma shuffled a little and looked down at the table in front of her. She glanced back at Akane, who reached forward to grip the hand Ranma sent back.</p><p>"Saotome-san?"</p><p>"Yes," Ranma said quietly. "He...He...raped me."</p><p>"And you blame Principal Kuno for that?"</p><p>"No," Ranma said, gripping Akane's hand tightly. "He didn't have anything to do with that. That was his...son and this girl that drugged me."</p><p>"Why didn't you report this to the police at the time?"</p><p>"They were both skilled martial artists," Ranma said. "Sending the police would have been a slaughter."</p><p>"So you handled it yourself then?" The voice sounded disapproving.</p><p>"Yes," Ranma said. "I didn't want to see anybody die. And...And I didn't want anybody else to learn about what he did."</p><p>"You didn't lead him on, perhaps?"</p><p>"I was drugged," Ranma said. "I didn't have very much control, but I Did say No!" Ranma's voice cracked and she had to take a moment to rebuild her soul of ice. "I didn't want to."</p><p>"Okay!" One of them interrupted, snapping Ranma back into shape by the rudeness of it. "Assume the rape did happen." His attitude drew an angry glare from Ranma and Akane. "What does this have to do with the Principal and his administrative method?"</p><p>"When he expelled us," Ranma said, almost growling. She turned to glare at the principal. "He told me not ta blame other people for my spilt milk. He also said that his son could have any girl he wanted."</p><p>"And this represents an unsafe administrator?" The same person asked.</p><p>"It does sound like a desperate father defending his son," another board member added reluctantly.</p><p>"He throws around exploding pineapples," Ranma said. "He sent live lobsters to attack students, nearly drowned us in an artificial flood, he once put a live shark in the swimming pool with Akane! And Akane can't swim!"</p><p>"Okay, Saotome-san," one of them said after a long silence. "You may return to your seat." Ranma nodded and stepped away from the table, staring at the ground. Akane stood up to meet her as she turned away and hugged her.</p><p>"Are you going to be okay?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I need to go the bathroom," Ranma said, quietly.</p><p>"Ranma," Akane said firmly. "Are you okay?" Ranma nodded as they walked along towards the doors to the chamber.</p><p>"Excuse me, Ten, Saotome Akane," somebody said. "I believe it is your turn."</p><p>"Hey..." Akane protested. Ranma laid a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"I'll be fine," Ranma said. "And...I'm just going to the bathroom."</p><p>"Saotome-san." They sounded impatient.</p><p>"Just get it over with," Ranma said. "And I'll be right back."</p><p>"I guess so," Akane said. He kissed Ranma on the forehead and hugged her tightly. "You're sure you're fine?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said.</p><p>The faucet was running, cold not hot. Ranma didn't want a reminder at the moment as she splashed her face with the running water. She let out a long breath and let go of the soul of ice as slowly as she could. Her shoulders started shaking as she quietly sobbed gripping the side of the sink, growling low between sobs.</p><p>She immediately tensed up and quieted as the door opened behind her. She didn't really want to look up in the mirror to see who it was.</p><p>"You!" the newcomer shouted angrily. Now Ranma really knew she didn't want to look up, but she already knew who it was. "You lying little piece of perverted fluff."</p><p>"Go away," Ranma said, still looking down into the sink.</p><p>"There aren't any other bathrooms," the girl snapped. Ranma could hear her edging toward one of stalls. "Otherwise I would have just turned around and left. Do you think I want to be in the same room as a some sort of freak rug munching publicity hound like you."</p><p>"Leave me alone," Ranma growled, moving her eyes up to look at Jin's reflection in the mirror.</p><p>"If all you want to do here is practice your acting for all the idiots out in the stands," Jin said, crossing her arms. "Then get out and let me do my business." Ranma whirled around and was suddenly in the other girl's face.</p><p>"What is your problem!" Ranma demanded. Jin flinched back against the wall. "What did I do to you? You think I like people poking at me? I hate this! I HATE IT! Do I prefer women? Fuck yes! I'm supposed to like girls! I'm supposed to be the father! I'm not supposed to...know what it's like...ta BE one!"</p><p>She punched the stall door to the side of Jin's head and pushed away.</p><p>"Well now I am one," Ranma said. She continued under her breath, quietly coming down from the rage. "Maybe in more ways than one."</p><p>Ranma sniffed at the air and snorted irritably. She walked to the sink and took a deep breath and splashed her face to wash away the tear tracks.</p><p>"Sorry," Ranma said reluctantly. "But at least you don't need to use the toilet anymore." Jin stayed plastered against the wall, staring at Ranma wide-eyed. Ranma shook her head in disgust at the girl. One minute a rabid dog, but as soon as any resistance is shown she's a wallflower.</p><p>"You forgot who I was, eh?" She asked quietly. "Those jerks forgot too, you saw the cast?" Jin nodded nervously, Ranma continued on without turning to see it. "He grabbed me." She turned fiercely towards Jin. "Nobody is going to touch me like that except Akane, got it?"</p><p>"Yeah," Jin said, nervously.</p><p>"Get yourself cleaned up and stay out of my face," Ranma snapped, irritable again. She seemed actually shrink as she stalked to restroom exit. "Why the hell are you even here?"</p><p>Ranma walked out the door shaking. As soon as the door closed, Jin slumped to the floor releasing a long breath. She swallowed and starred at the sink, noticing the finger marks where Ranma had been gripping the ceramic.</p>
