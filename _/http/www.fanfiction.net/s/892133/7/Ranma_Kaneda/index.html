Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>07: Taihen Beef<p>Twice the usual number of uniformed jocks was waiting at<br/>the Furinkan's gate and along its walk to the front<br/>doors. Reinforcements had been called in after<br/>yesterday's challenge for the title "Best Athlete" had a<br/>new winner. Nobody had heard of the new guy Kei Tendou.<br/>He hadn't even introduced himself with a proper<br/>challenge. The guy had no right to come out of nowhere to<br/>make his reputation. He had to be taught a lesson. "Do<br/>you think this Kei Tendou is related to Kaneda Tendou?"/<br/>"What a dumb question: Of COURSE they're related!"/ "As<br/>a martial arts fan, I say he has the same fighting style<br/>as Kaneda Tendou."/ "Didn't you hear about the story<br/>Nabiki Tendou's telling?"/ "The one where Kei Tendou is<br/>on the run from his clan?"/ "-And is hiding with his<br/>cousin, Kaneda."/ "Well, Greater Tokyo IS far from<br/>Fukuoka."/ "And ALL because of an arranged marriage with<br/>some girl!"/ "Yeah, a girl named, uh, Akane Saotome!"/<br/>"Do you think Akane Saotome is related to Ranma Saotome?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda's feet barely touched the ground as he raced to<br/>school. I've done it! I took the next step, and it feels<br/>okay! The first step had been when he had ASKED to be<br/>engaged to Ranma-chan. I'm actually thinking of marrying<br/>her!<p>In his head the a scenario unfolded:<p>Ranma-chan's father challenges Kaneda in a duel for the<br/>hand of his daughter. As they face off in the Tendou<br/>Dojo, he declares, "I will never let you take my daughter<br/>away from me. She has belonged to me all of her life: And<br/>she will be ALL of her life." He charges with, "THAT'S<br/>why she must be the husband!"<p>Kaneda answers, "That's why she MUST be a wife!"<p>Before Kaneda reaches Mr. Saotome, he falls hard onto<br/>the floor. Ranma-chan had landed on his back. She cries,<br/>"That's for ME to decide!"<p>Kaneda has no time to stop. Ranma-chan throws a fist to<br/>his throat and gut. "Anybody that wants to be MY better<br/>half HAD better be better 'n me!" Kaneda ducks the upper<br/>fist, and shoves on the lower. Ranma-chan is spun like a<br/>turnstile. Kaneda tramples over Mr. Saotome.<p>Ranma-chan stops her spinning and attacks him from<br/>behind, "If you think I'm gonna let you make me the<br/>traditional Japanese wife, you got another think comin'!"<p>Kaneda manages to dodge her blows. He strikes back. As<br/>she deflects them with her palms, Kaneda tells her,<br/>"Walk three paces behind? Keep your eyes lowered?<br/>Don't talk? Do nothing to attract attention to yourself?<br/>-That's only in public!" Kaneda's fear of becoming a<br/>girl had latched onto horror stories like that.<p>The blows have been pushing small Ranma-chan back. She<br/>counters by kicking, "OH! ONLY in public!"<p>Kaneda blocks her kicks with his kicks of his own,<br/>"Haven't you heard the news stories about quiet, little<br/>wives who beat their husbands at home?"<p>Ranma-chan goes on the offensive, speeding up her attacks,<br/>"But if I don't marry you, I can beat the crap outa you in<br/>public, TOO!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Meanwhile, outside of Kaneda's head:<p>On the school grounds, the guys who had already been put<br/>down by Kaneda groaned, "That wasn't KEI Tendou!"/<br/>"Kaneda's gotten even BETTER!"/ "Kei must be giving<br/>Kaneda martial arts tips!"/ "And we thought we could<br/>take KEI!"/ "As a martial arts fan, I think Kaneda has<br/>attained the ultimate fighting state of mind."/<br/>"Meaning?"/ "He's not thinking about us at ALL! His<br/>body is acting on pure conditioned reflexes!" / "Ow.<br/>Now, that hurts."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda says to Ranma-chan, "Fine: You can be an American-<br/>style wife-But if I beat you, you have to BE my wife!"<p>Ranma-chan answers, "Come and get it! I'm ready for-"<p>Mr. Saotome suddenly tosses Ranma-chan out the dojo's<br/>door. "No American-style: You have to get by the father<br/>first!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The P.E. Teacher Mr. Shuaatsuneiga stood on top of the<br/>front steps of the school, "You down there! Class in<br/>session, you know! Come in here this second!"<p>The well-built man was bumped aside and off the stoop<br/>as Kuno charged out of the building behind him.<p>Kuno ran toward the daydreaming Kaneda, his wooden sword<br/>ready to deliver its blow, "Kaneda Tendou, I challenge<br/>you! Give over Ranma Saotome!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda leaps, feet out towards the man who stands in the<br/>way of his dreams, "Ha! Make that Ranma Tendou!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Up at her usual place of the second story window, Nabiki<br/>saw her brother's foot hit Kuno-baby's face. No sooner<br/>had her classmate's head hit the ground, but Kaneda<br/>pushed off on it. But what really caused the samurai-boy<br/>to lose face was what Kaneda then yelled: "Come back<br/>here, Ranma! I promise to beat you gentle like! All I<br/>want to do is win you!"<p>Nabiki commented, "Little brother has really fallen for<br/>Ranma."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki had sized up the situation. Turning from her spot<br/>by the window, she saw the same old, substitute teacher<br/>as they'd had for homeroom period as yesterday. She<br/>seized on the opportunity. She called out, "Come on,<br/>girls! This is an emergency! There are a pack of 52 hunks<br/>laying out there that's going to need some attention!"<p>More girls than just her vice presidents followed her out<br/>the door.<p>Taken by surprise, the only thing the teacher could think<br/>to say was, "Hey! No running in the halls!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Standing beside a basin on a stand, Nabiki wrung out its<br/>cold water from a towel. She took the cloth to the chair<br/>beside the bed Kuno was laid out on. Seating herself, she<br/>said, "Kuno, take my advice. You've REALLY got to work on<br/>your technique."<p>Before she could put the damp cloth on his brow, Kuno<br/>suddenly gained semi-consciousness. He sat up in bed,<br/>"Ah, my goddess in pigtails, I shall never let you go, My<br/>Love!" He then lay back on the pillow.<p>Nabiki stared at him, "Hmm? Pigtailed girl?"<p>Kuno heard, and rose up again, "No, my wild haired<br/>huntress, you don't understand. I love you, Akane, like<br/>no other," he declared, crossing his arms over his heart.<br/>He lay back down.<p>Nabiki eyed the guy who wasn't living up to her plans.<br/>She crossed her arms. Kuno was rich. But he was also<br/>unstable. He would most likely become possessive and<br/>attack any guy who showed an interest in 'his' girl.<br/>Which would be bad for business. With the right kind of<br/>promotion, the volume of guys willing to pay for Ranma-<br/>related merchandise would more than make up for the loss<br/>of Kuno's money...<p>Kuno was back up, "Oh, you pigtailed goddess. Ranma, I<br/>would date with you." He lay back down.<p>... But why couldn't Nabiki have Kuno as a client, TOO?<br/>There was always 'Akane Saotome'. -AND by giving Kuno<br/>Akane, his new sweetheart would be taking his mind off of<br/>Ranma. Akane would WORK at it, in fact! Meanwhile Nabiki<br/>would actually be doing Akane a favor. Nabiki wasn't<br/>throwing HER to the school's wolves. There would be only<br/>ONE guy after Akane, and she had proven many times she<br/>could take him.<p>He came back up, "Wild haired huntress, allow me to date<br/>with you." This time he gently took Nabiki's hand.<p>With her free hand, Nabiki took the basin from the stand,<br/>and jarred the dreamer out of his delirium.<p>Frowning at the jerk, she said, "Are you quite finished<br/>now, Kuno?"<p>The crumpled basin still on his head, Kuno told her,<br/>"That hurt, Nabiki Tendou."<p>Testily, Nabiki asked, "Is dating girls the only thing<br/>you think about, Kuno?"<p>His arms crossed, Kuno told her, "Fear not, Nabiki. I<br/>have no intention of asking you out."<p>Nabiki answered with sarcasm, "Oh, I am SO disappointed."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>After homeroom period was over, Kaneda started doing the<br/>math. What fantasy world was *I* in! I know how good<br/>Ranma is! Genma is her sensei! I've seen them spar<br/>against each other: They do things I thought were only<br/>legendary!<p>He hung his head. His battle aura dimmed like a candle<br/>flame not drawing enough wax. Who am I kidding? I HAVE<br/>to worry about being challenged by them. Get beat, then<br/>get lost. Those will be the terms.<p>The bell at last announced the first period was over.<p>Hiroshi came over, "Where's Ranma?"<p>Daisuke joined him, "Your houseguest didn't LEAVE<br/>already?"<p>Kaneda, still slumped forward in his desk, said, "No. But<br/>she might as well, for all of the chance I have with<br/>her."<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke looked at each other: "They had a<br/>fight."<p>Sayuri said, "I shouldn't wonder."<p>Yuka joined her on the other side of Kaneda, "The way you<br/>let the guys treat her yesterday."<p>Sayuri said, "Just because she's a martial artist..."<p>Sayuri waited. Yuka didn't finish her thought.<p>Finally, Sayuri had to say, "Well! Aren't you going to<br/>say "...doesn't mean she is isn't a woman inside"?"<p>Yuka answered, "But you've said martial arts makes a girl<br/>different from ordinary women."<p>Sayuri asked, "What! I meant it gives her confidence."<p>Yuka said, "But she bailed on us between classes. Ranma<br/>couldn't face the pressure of being the new girl."<p>In the other aisle, Hiroshi would've liked to have had a<br/>chance to 'console' her, "Yuka, you KNOW what a martial<br/>arts fan Sayuri is."<p>Daisuke said, "It's blinded her to the softness a TRUE<br/>girl must have."<p>Sayuri scorned, "And if a girl isn't, then she's a bitch,<br/>I suppose!"<p>Daisuke said, "It makes her hard. Isn't that right,<br/>Hiroshi?"<p>Hiroshi hesitated. Daisuke tended to be more tactless<br/>than he liked to be. "Er, well, in a...relationship,<br/>somebody has to be the one that yields."<p>Yuka's ears perked up. He'd actually said the R-word.<p>Sayuri demanded, "And WHY can't it be the guy who gives<br/>in!"<p>Hiroshi said, "Because that makes him a wimp."<p>Daisuke said, "And only a bitch would want a wimp."<p>Sayuri cried, "What! A man isn't a man unless he's "The<br/>man"! It's the WOMAN who has to jump through the<br/>hoops!..."<p>As they argued around him, Kaneda heard...and thought.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>By the end of the third class, Kaneda was still thinking.<p>The only reason he moved from his desk was because it was<br/>the cleaning period. Hiroshi had lifted a desk and was<br/>ready to put it on top of Kaneda's. "Come on, so we can<br/>sweep and mop and get out of here."<p>Kaneda nodded, "...Out of here." And that's what he<br/>absent-mindedly did, taking her schoolbag with him.<p>As Kaneda was leaving, Daisuke cried, "Hey! You can't get<br/>out of work detail THAT easy!" And he sloshed some of the<br/>water from his mop bucket at Kaneda's back.<p>Mr. Egami yelled, "Koyasu! The floor hasn't even been<br/>swept yet! Why are you wasting hot water!"<p>Daisuke pointed in the direction of the classmate who was<br/>already out of sight. But he decided he wasn't allowed to<br/>snitch on his friend.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The red haired Kaneda was gone. The black haired Kane-<br/>chan Saotome walked down the hall, barely aware she was<br/>in a Furinkan girls' uniform. Ranma does respect<br/>strength, doesn't she? Look what happened when she wanted<br/>to try out her "Saotome Hot Water Attack". Because I was<br/>a guy and didn't wimp out, SHE stayed around. We had a<br/>fair and honorable (and exhausting) battle. Then when it<br/>was time to sleep, she let me. She didn't try to attack<br/>me in my bedroom. Kane-chan didn't really consider her<br/>battles with Ranma-kun as battles with the same person.<br/>And since that Ranma was a male, Kane-chan was free to do<br/>things against HIM that she wouldn't think of doing<br/>against a girl (especially the one she had feelings for).<p>She clenched her hand, I HAVE to stand up to her. I may<br/>not win, but I will definitely lose her, if I don't.<p>She walked down the school stairs, And I must not lose<br/>her. Ranma's had a hard life. That's what she was raised<br/>with. That's all she knows for herself. I can't offer her<br/>a softer life until she thinks she wants it.<p>Kane-chan continued her thinking right through to the<br/>shoe lockers. ...No, she'd just scoff at the considerate<br/>suitor act. -Being romantic! Flowers, candy, gifts<br/>wouldn't go down right with her. I can't see Ranma as<br/>being that kind of girl.<p>She took off her school slippers and put them in the<br/>small locker as she took her shoes out, Ha! I can JUST<br/>imagine her reaction if I did try any of that gooey<br/>stuff.<p>Kane-chan stopped her musing as she took the first shoe<br/>off, and put it back on, then took them off again. She<br/>looked at the cross-trainers to see why it was so loose.<br/>"It's MY shoe! I mean, the ones I wear when I'm me,<br/>Kaneda. Oh, great! I wasn't wearing them when I changed."<br/>She slammed the shoe locker closed.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan headed for the nearest restroom.<p>But which one should she go in, the men's or women's?<br/>Down on the main floor, there were more people out in the<br/>hall...and more adults. It was important she make her<br/>decision quickly.<p>Before she had made up her mind, two of those adults came<br/>out of each door. They each stopped to look at her.<p>Kane-chan turned, and said, waving, "Never mind! I can<br/>use one of the lavs on the way home."<p>The man called after her, "You're not suppose to leave<br/>the grounds until after the afternoon recess on<br/>Saturdays!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan left the school grounds on barefoot. Tying the<br/>laces together, she had her guy-shoes draped over her<br/>schoolbag. "This is 'nice'!" she thought as she stepped<br/>on a particularly knobby pebble. "I haven't been a girl<br/>enough! My feet are too soft!"<p>But that thought led to a smile, "Ranma doesn't have any<br/>trouble going without shoes." That brought her attention<br/>to her boobs, "AND she doesn't wear a bra." She adjusted<br/>the bra she was wearing, "That just shows Ranma's is a<br/>better girl than I am." Or she's bothered by constant<br/>little irritations more. To Kane-chan bras were a<br/>necessary evil. And right now she was having a hard time<br/>getting comfortable in the evil thing. It's a wonder<br/>bras find the right place. It's not like they're like<br/>anything Kaneda wears.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Swinging her bookbag ahead of her, Kane-chan ran around a<br/>street corner. There she had to slow to a stop.<p>Kane-chan leaned against a privacy wall to rest. She was<br/>tired, sweaty, and her naked feet hurt. "I think I lost<br/>her."<p>She clenched her fist and glared at it, "All I did was<br/>try and use the men's room. That waitress made me feel<br/>like a pervert. I WASN'T a pervert! I was a girl! It's<br/>not like I was going to be a GUY in the woman's room!"<p>From above Ranma-chan said, "Hmf! Some martial artist you<br/>are."<p>Frowning, Kane-chan looked up. Looking like the last time<br/>she saw her, Ranma was squatting on the wall just near<br/>her head. "Oh! And YOU'D beat up on a waitress!"<p>Ranma-chan jumped down. She barely bent anything to<br/>absorb the impact, and immediately stood more erect than<br/>she usually did, "A true martial artist doesn't have to beat<br/>PEOPLE up."<p>Kane-chan crossed her arms, "And I-" She took her bare<br/>arms away from her chest, "-suppose you threaten people<br/>all the time? Considering how you were raised, you<br/>probably-"<p>Ranma-chan leaned forward as she swung her fist down to<br/>her side, "No! Where would the honor be in THAT!"<p>Kane-chan hesitated for a second, then threw her nose up,<br/>"Hmph! I'll bet." She did her best to ignore her as she<br/>walked away, "What did you do then?"<p>Fuming, Ranma-chan followed, "Usually we RAN, if you have<br/>to know!"<p>Kane-chan's anger did increased, "That's what *I* did!<br/>What makes YOU any different!"<p>Ranma-chan ran up in front of the girl, "Me and Pop don't<br/>run UNTIL we get what we're after!" There was a "usually"<br/>in there, but Ranma didn't like qualifying her arguments.<br/>It didn't sound as forceful. Besides those times they<br/>DIDN'T achieve their goals, it was because POP chickened<br/>out.<p>Kane-chan went around her, " "Get what you're after"?<br/>Hmph! It makes you seem like thieves."<p>Ranma yelled in frustration, "I'm NOT a thief!" Pop, on<br/>the other hand... "Honor is important to me!" Loyalty to<br/>family was more honorable than loyalty to the law.<p>Kane-chan thought, If I wasn't angry, I'd be pleased.<br/>She noticed they were passing a restaurant, The "Taihen<br/>Beef". She nodded towards it, "Okay, go into THEIR men's<br/>room."<p>Ranma-chan hesitated only because it wasn't HER idea. But<br/>it WAS a challenge. Grumbling, Ranma-chan tromped into<br/>the restaurant.<p>Kane-chan walked towards the door, So that IS the way to<br/>handle Ranma. Being nice will probably only get me<br/>ignored and dismissed, because I wouldn't register on her<br/>martial arts radar. It didn't help her mood. She thinks<br/>life is a challenge. I have to GIVE her ones to keep her<br/>attention. I just wish I were smart enough to know how to<br/>maneuver her into the life I want to give her.<p>Kane-chan stuck her head under the noren/door curtain.<br/>Ranma-chan WAS headed for the restrooms. The redhead had<br/>to move back, though, to let a very large, very muscular<br/>man wearing sweats and a wrestler's mask get by.<p>Kane-chan felt for her wallet. Crap! Why can't girls<br/>have pockets! "Sir!" she said to the wrestler. "My<br/>friend, the one just going in the men's room, she hasn't<br/>eaten since lunch, yesterday. Will you tell her to wait<br/>here, while I find some money? There is no reason to<br/>commit suicide!" All of it IS the truth.<p>The man said, "That was a girl?" He looked in time to<br/>see her go in. "The poor, little thing." Nodding, he<br/>headed for the restroom. "I, the Great Beef Bowl, will<br/>save her!" He puffed out his chest as he sucked in his<br/>belly. He had a lecherous look on his face, though, told<br/>what his real intentions were.<p>Kane-chan blinked, "Beef Bowl"? That guy is WAY too<br/>much of an "Urusei Yatsura" fan. But, then, he may have<br/>just hated teachers. Mr. Onsen-Mark got beat up by a<br/>wrestler by that name.<p>Kane-chan stepped back outside to where she could see the<br/>restaurant's sign. "Of course, where ELSE would a "Lum"<br/>fan want to eat at? "Taihen" not only means "A Lot of",<br/>it also means "Terribly Weird"." But she failed to see<br/>that the owner was from Okinawa. The owner knew the<br/>double meaning the English word "Beef" had for Americans.<p>Song refrain:<p>"Let's put weird and weird together<br/>And make it even weirder!<br/>Weird, weird space is<br/>Terribly weird!"<p>Kane-chan heard Ranma yell, "PERVERT!" There was a<br/>*Kvang*, *Glahott* and a *Flush*, as somebody big was<br/>thrown into a toilet stall.<p>Kane-chan hurried to stand outside, looking as innocent<br/>as she could.<p>Ranma-chan came leaping out of the restaurant. She<br/>bounded a sharp left, saw Kane-chan standing near the<br/>door, and did a 180. "That was YOUR idea, wasn't it!"<p>Kane-chan answered, "You lost!"<p>Ranma-chan told her, "I did not lose!"<p>Kane-chan stepped away from her, "Yes you did. You<br/>fought, you didn't run!"<p>Ranma-chan took her arm, and spun her around to face her,<br/>"Wrestlers don't count as people! Not one ACTING like<br/>that!"<p>Kane-chan got in her face, "AND you didn't get what you<br/>went in there for!"<p>Ranma-chan had leaned backwards. But that was ALL the<br/>ground she was prepared to cede, "Yes I did! The bet was<br/>I wouldn't go into the men's room like this!"<p>Behind Kane-chan, in Ranma's sight, the owner of the<br/>"Taihen Beef" (a squat man in a white t-shirt and short<br/>chef's hat) yelled, "You caused trouble in my place<br/>because of a stupid BET!" He was waving the second<br/>biggest meat cleaver that Ranma had ever seen. "That<br/>is my best customer!"<p>Kane-chan picked Ranma-chan up by the shirt material<br/>around her armpits, "The challenge was: You have to<br/>CHANGE in that men's room!" She swung Ranma-chan around,<br/>out of her way: "You have to STAY like this until you<br/>do!"<p>The man with the cleaver ran at Ranma-chan. As she bent,<br/>tumbled, ducked and jumped out of the way of the massive<br/>cleaver, Kane-chan forced herself to walk away. The<br/>commotion behind her went on for at least a minute. When<br/>it stopped, Kane-chan clapped her hands together; she<br/>prayed, Give me the certainty that Ranma IS as great<br/>martial artist as I think she is.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>What Kane-chan had done to Ranma-chan didn't make her<br/>feel good. It slowed her pace, as she brooded. She even<br/>missed a couple of turns, and had to go back the way<br/>she'd come.<p>Kane-chan didn't feel like making her travel any longer.<br/>She came in the front door this time. It feels strange.<br/>I'm not used to simply walking into the house as a girl.<br/>Before, I always tried to pretend I didn't become a girl.<br/>I wonder what it would be like if I said, "I'm home!"<p>Kasumi was vacuuming the inner hall. But she heard.<br/>She stopped the machine and said, "Well, hello, Akane<br/>Saotome! Welcome to our home."<p>Kane-chan walked over to where she could see her oneesan.<br/>" "Hello, Akane Saotome. Welcome to our home"?"<p>Kasumi explained, "To get Father to accept you, you have<br/>to be a guest in the house. I'm sorry."<p>'Akane Saotome' sighed, and nodded. "Okay, I'll play<br/>along. It's better than him blanking out on us."<p>As 'the guest' went to the stairs, Kasumi told her, "Mr.<br/>Saotome's out, but Ranma's up there." (A heavy load went<br/>off of Kane-chan's heart. Ranma had survived after all.)<br/>"Try not to disturb her. The poor dear fell asleep the<br/>moment her head hit the pillow." Her!<p>Kane-chan said, "Yes. I bet she didn't get much sleep<br/>last night outside. I don't think she even had a pillow."<p>Though relieved, Kane-chan thought, Maybe Ranma ISN'T<br/>the martial artist I thought she was. She couldn't get<br/>hot water in a men's room! Despite the owner, and maybe<br/>the wrestler, it shouldn't be THAT difficult.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>By the top of the stairs, Kane-chan was thinking, WHY<br/>wouldn't I want Ranma to be the girl? I should be glad<br/>she failed. A hope began to form, Maybe this is an<br/>excuse. Maybe Ranma really WANTS to be a girl.<br/>Subconsciously, anyway.<p>Kane-chan turned the corner. She saw Nabiki, still in her<br/>school uniform, coming towards her with a camera. It<br/>didn't register how close she was to Ranma's open sliding<br/>door. "Akane-"<p>Kane-chan stopped, and told her, "Not YOU, too!"<p>Nabiki said, "There's a name that goes with the body,<br/>now."<p>Kane-chan thought, And with a different name, a<br/>different attitude from what should be my family.<p>Nabiki said, "Akane, are you going to do your usual<br/>Saturday afternoon workout?"<p>Kane-chan said, "If it's any of your business, I feel<br/>like taking a nap."<p>Nabiki smiled, "Good! Pleasant dreams!" As she let Akane,<br/>she said, "Oh! And don't forget to change into Kaneda!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It wasn't long before Kane-chan was out in the arena in<br/>front of the family dojo lifting dumbbells. Dressed in<br/>her usual yellow martial arts uniform. But this time she<br/>was wearing something called a sports bra. She DIDN'T<br/>like it. She wasn't used to wearing regular bras. It<br/>squeezed her. She did her best to ignore her discomforts,<br/>I WASN'T going to work out. But I do need to build-up<br/>this body. I can't always count on being a guy to fight<br/>my battles. She wasn't wearing anything on her feet.<p>When Nabiki finally showed up with the camera, she<br/>managed to sound almost disappointed, "Akane? What<br/>happened to Kaneda?"<p>Putting more force into her up-thrusts, Kane-chan told<br/>her, "I don't know why you want to take more pictures of<br/>Kaneda. But I know you're up to something. You have more<br/>than enough all ready. If you want to take pictures, take<br/>them like I am now."<p>Nabiki said, "You're a girl without makeup, a hairdo, or<br/>even a pretty outfit."<p>Kane-chan smiled smugly, "That's right. Nobody's going to<br/>want to pay for pictures of me looking like this." Kaneda<br/>DID think that. The girls in the pictures Hiroshi and<br/>Daisuke had shown her didn't look this unsexy...even<br/>those in "less than dignified" poses.<p>Nabiki started taking pictures, anyway. "If you don't<br/>mind, then. I need to fill up the roll so I can take it<br/>to "Quique-de-Velop"." Nabiki believed in having<br/>negatives.<p>Frowning, now, Kane-chan wondered what she was really up<br/>to.<p>Suddenly an arrow came out of nowhere: It struck one of<br/>the posts of the covered walkway between the house and<br/>dojo. Another 30 centimeters and it would've been Nabiki's<br/>face.<p>Kane-chan said the obvious, "Hey! That could hurt<br/>somebody."<p>Nabiki barely allowed herself to show any reaction.<br/>Looking for an excuse to do something besides stand<br/>there, she saw the neatly fold paper tied around the<br/>arrow. "Oo, it's a letter."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki opened the folded letter out.<p>Kane-chan asked, "Who's it from?"<p>After reading it, Nabiki let Kane-chan see, "Here."<p>Kane-chan read it, " "Dear Nabiki Tendou"..." It didn't<br/>take long for her to figure out from the florid dialect<br/>who it was from, "..."Oh, how this spring of joy<br/>resembleth the uncertain glory of an April day. Anyway:<br/>Please come to Caf
