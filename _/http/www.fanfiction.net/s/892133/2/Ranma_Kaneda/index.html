</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>02: Ranma's Girl Problem<p>Kaneda dropped his do-gi pants in the laundry<br/>basket. He paused to look at the familiar door that<br/>had taunted him all of his life. Everybody else<br/>could take hot soaks in the furo/tub, but not him.<br/>He had to take cold showers. If he didn't, he would<br/>be changed into a girl the minute he touched hot<br/>water.<p>But he was raised to be a guy, the man who would<br/>inherit the Tendou legacy and property. Every time<br/>he did not live up to his dad's expectations, Dad<br/>went weird. Every time his sister Nabiki discovered<br/>him as a girl, she would make comments that made him<br/>feel little. But worse, every time Kasumi found him<br/>as a girl, she would treat him as if he WERE a girl!<p>By the time he was old enough to think there might<br/>be some benefits to his problem, he'd met his<br/>friends. Hiroshi and Daisuke made it clear what you<br/>were supposed to do with a girl's body. Meanwhile<br/>there were girls around him having a variety of<br/>female problems. His pubescent doubts and anxieties<br/>were multiplied. That's when he stopped taking hot<br/>baths altogether.<p>Kaneda the heir to the Tendou School of Anything-<br/>Goes Martials Arts lost his nerve.<p>But now the moment of truth had arrived. Hot water<br/>made him a girl because he really was...<p>His headache went from dull to throbbing! He'd had<br/>it since the girl Ranma'd socked him and he whacked<br/>his head on the floor of the dojo. It was different<br/>from anything he'd felt before.<p>Little did he suspect he then he was but the first<br/>of a number of people who would receive the<br/>"Juusenkyo Blow to the Soul".<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki, then the new girl knelt down at the living<br/>room table, and waited across from each other for<br/>the big explosion from the bathroom.<p>Kasumi offered, "I'll go fill the kettle again and<br/>we can have tea."<p>The little Ranma watch the older sister get the<br/>teakettle from where Nabiki'd left it, and leave for<br/>the kitchen. "Is she serious?"<p>Nabiki said, "Try oblivious. Daddy doesn't want to<br/>deal with Kaneda's change, so Kasumi doesn't want<br/>to, either."<p>Ranma got the creeps, "So, you mean Kaneda's been<br/>free to play her sick games all a her life?"<p>Big sister slapped her hand down on the table, "Try<br/>the other way around, Saotome! Whatever else Kaneda<br/>may be, he has family feeling. He knows it how<br/>upsets everybody and the neighbors when he changes."<br/>Then she leaned forward to level her eye at the<br/>strange girl making insinuations. "Kaneda does NOT<br/>become a girl out of choice." Nabiki realized she<br/>hadn't readjusted how SHE thought of her little<br/>'brother', yet.<p>"H, hel, hello," a voice at the door said.<p>Ranma looked, and said to the older sister, "Make<br/>that past tense."<p>Standing in a blue terrycloth bathrobe was a 5'4"<br/>girl with long black hair. Beyond that Ranma was in<br/>no mood to judge.<p>Nabiki looked, and commented, "You haven't changed a<br/>bit since the last time I teased you, Kane-chan."<p>Kane-chan frowned, "Thanks for reminding of another<br/>reason I don't like having this body."<p>Though remaining sympathetic, Nabiki couldn't resist<br/>saying, "Once you get used to being a girl, I can<br/>always tease you by turning you into a guy."<p>Kane-chan came over to the table, "You don't tease<br/>Kasumi!"<p>Nabiki, still smiling said, "I guess it's just more<br/>fun to kid your kid brother."<p>It was Ranma's turn to level her eyes, " ' Sounds<br/>like you're jealous."<p>Nabiki give her a bemused look, "Me? Jealous?"<p>Kane-chan fell to her knees on the side between<br/>them, "Oh, great! If a girl who's been a girl all of<br/>her life thinks it's better to be a guy, why do I<br/>want to be a girl?"<p>Nabiki said to her sibling, but putting an edge to<br/>it for Ranma, "I didn't say I didn't like being a<br/>girl. Look what's suggesting it!"<p>Kane-chan bowed her head towards her breasts.<br/>"Someone who knows what it's like to be both."<p>Ranma said, "You got that right! Bein' a girl<br/>sucks!"<p>Kane-chan flinched at the unfortunate choice of<br/>word. Ranma didn't notice the implications, but,<br/>then, he didn't have friends like Hiroshi and<br/>Daisuke.<p>Big sister said, "You're NOT helping, Saotome. You<br/>KNOW I don't just have Kaneda I can tease now."<p>Ranma thumbed her fist towards herself, "Try it, and<br/>you'll wish you hadn't!"<p>Nabiki said, "Is that a challenge?"<p>Kane-chan cried, "Stop it! Isn't there enough<br/>conflict going on inside me, without having to hear<br/>it outside!" She was fighting to keep from crying.<br/>She had sworn never to cry like... Dad.<p>To Ranma it was just like a girl. She snorted. "I<br/>had expected more rage and furry at findin' out you<br/>weren't a guy."<p>Kane-chan rested her forearms on the table, "I<br/>always knew I could change into a girl. I just<br/>didn't know I was a girl." She slumped over the<br/>table. She felt her breasts try to dangle within her<br/>robe. {Do girls get used to the feeling?}<p>Kasumi appeared at the door, "I thought I heard<br/>company. The tea will only be a few minutes more.<br/>But why don't you invite the girl to dinner. We'll<br/>have more than enough, seeing as Father and his old<br/>friend seem to have decided to dine out together.<br/>They have SO much to catch up on."<p>Ranma leaned her weight on an arm while she studied<br/>the oldest sister. "No reality check there." The to<br/>her, "Aren't you interested in WHO this girl is?<br/>That WOULD be the polite thing to ask."<p>Kasumi started to fidget. "Well...yes. That WOULD be<br/>the proper amenity when meeting a new person..." She<br/>was beginning to perspire. "I try to be the proper<br/>hostess. I don't know where..."<p>Her back to her motherly sister, Kane-chan could<br/>hear how uncomfortable she was. She was being forced<br/>to face something she had been trying to avoid all<br/>of her life, and it tore Kane-chan up inside, too.<p>Nabiki hissed at Ranma, "That WASN'T a smart move,<br/>martial artist!"<p>Ranma shot back at her, "It ain't gonna keep naggin'<br/>at her WHY there's a strange girl in her house that<br/>isn't going away?"<p>Nabiki saw Ranma was, unfortunately, right. Kaneda<br/>the girl would not be going away as before. To learn<br/>to be a girl, he-she(!) had to remain a girl.<p>She took a deep breath, and faced the sister still<br/>stuck in a dither, "Kasumi, this i...uh, Akane."<p>Ranma rolled her big blue eyes. She couldn't come up<br/>with a more original name? A-Kane-d-A, really!<p>Immediately, Kasumi was back to her normal self,<br/>"Akane! Such a nice name for a girl."<p>Kane-chan took her head off the table to look at the<br/>one who liked to think she was the smart one. "<br/>"Akane"?" Her skin crawled. Kaneda was a shield<br/>that kept her from fully recognizing the femaleness<br/>threatening to overwhelm her.<p>Nabiki said, "Trust me." She then continued for the<br/>benefit of Kasumi, "Akane Saotome."<p>Ranma leaped to her feet, "What!"<p>Kane-chan leaped to her feet, "I WAS thinking it<br/>would be Ranma TENDOU!" Obviously he WASN'T ready to<br/>admit which was the girl.<p>Nabiki put her right arm on the table, and tried to<br/>stare the two down, "Akane is Ranma-kun's kissing<br/>cousin. She can marry HIM." SHE certainly didn't<br/>want him!<p>Ranma-kun stomped her bare foot on the table, "I<br/>don't want to be ANYbody's fiancee!"<p>Kane-chan blinked at her sister. "Why would I want<br/>to marry a guy?"<p>Nabiki turned to Kane-chan, "Symmetry. Ranma-chan<br/>can still be the fiancee of Kaneda."<p>She added, "And everything would be legal. Almost."<br/>All they needed was a fake birth certificate.<p>Ranma lifted the table up, "If I don't want a girl..."<br/>There was something about this guy-girl that got on<br/>his last nerve! He flipped the table behind her and<br/>strode to center stage. She DEMANDED their<br/>attention! "...I damned well WON'T marry guy! A real<br/>guy or not, I've got my pride: I'm a GUY!"<p>Startled, Kaneda looked at the girl martial artist.<br/>There was nothing like danger to concentrate the<br/>mind, {Ranma's not a girl. She's the guy I chased<br/>around the house..." Revelation! "That's it!" she<br/>cried, leaping into her arms before Ranma had the<br/>chance to do anything else. "I have to be a girl to<br/>win over Ranma!"<p>Ranma cried, "Let go of me!" She was trying to<br/>shake the larger girl from her. Kane-chan had her<br/>mitts around the redhead's neck, and her legs were<br/>bent trapping her arm. "Get off! I told you I ain't<br/>gettin' hooked up to a freak!"<p>Nabiki watched Ranma-chan spin them around the room.<br/>Ranma-chan would go into this contortion or that<br/>somersault trying to dislodge Kane-chan. "Well,<br/>well. Saotome has a weak point." When Ranma-chan got<br/>close enough, Nabiki casually tripped her with a<br/>hand.<p>Ranma-chan fell; Kane-chan landed on her. Only Kane-<br/>chan cried, "Ah-ch, ch! Boobs hurt!"<p>Ranma yelled, "And they don't feel too good when<br/>somebody else's land on them, either!"<p>Kasumi was blushing, "That sort of thing might be<br/>alright for a man and his woman, but between TWO<br/>women?"<p>Nabiki told her, "Akane wants Ranma to become a guy<br/>again."<p>Kasumi nodded, "Oh! Then it would be alright!"<p>Nabiki said, "See, Ranma? You have to become a guy<br/>when Akane acts this way. If you don't, you will<br/>cause a scandal."<p>Furious now, Ranma looked at the girl on top of her.<br/>"The Code don't say nothing about a GIRL not beatin'<br/>up a girl!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki ran from the shouting and clashing, and<br/>banging in the family room. She went straight into<br/>the kitchen and to the kettle on the stovetop. She<br/>tapped it with her fingernails as a test. "A good<br/>thing there was already some hot water in it!" she<br/>said, rushing back to the rescue.<p>She found Rana-chan's arms crawling their way out<br/>from under the table, and Kane-chan struggling lift<br/>the armoire. She commented, "Don't be ridiculous.<br/>You couldn't even move that when you were a guy."<p>Kane-chan made one last attempt, muttering something<br/>about "Shinobu the Might Desk-throwing Girl".<p>Nabiki said, "Try Ryuunosuke." Would Kane-chan have<br/>any more luck than that martial arts girl did in<br/>overcoming her guy-conditioning?<p>She looked at Ranma-chan's head and shoulders come<br/>out in the open. Of course, Ryuunosuke ALSO married<br/>a cross-dressing guy.<p>A douse of hot water, and Ranma had black hair.<p>Ranma-kun's fist hit the floor in further<br/>frustration, "Now, I can't do anything to her!" He<br/>pushed the table away as he moved his legs free.<br/>"Why! Why couldn't I fight her! A girl can fight<br/>a girl!"<p>Nabiki said, "Well, there's your answer. To fight a<br/>girl, you have to accept that you are a girl, too."<br/>Luckily, Kaneda didn't have Ranma's rigid standard<br/>of manliness. She would know.<p>Ranma-kun tried to rise to his feet, "You don't<br/>think I'm a girl when I get wet!" His fingers<br/>touched the floor to steady himself.<p>Kane-chan came over, "Oh, she's a girl!"<p>Ranma told her, "He: HE!"<p>Nabiki turned a scornful eye to her younger sibling,<br/>"Only physically." Her gaze returned to Ranma-kun,<br/>"Until there's a break-through in his mental block,<br/>you should be safe. As long as you remain a girl."<p>Kane-chan said, "There's a motivation to stay cool."<p>Ranma felt solid enough to stand. "I thought you're<br/>SUPPOSED to be a martial art! What were you doing<br/>throwing things at me, and hitting me with a bamboo<br/>sword!"<p>Kane-chan told him, "When I'm a girl, I can use girl<br/>tactics: Anything-Goes!"<p>Ranma-kun shouted, "Anything-Goes MARTIAL Arts!<br/>Martial!"<p>Nabiki almost smiled. She was surprised that Kane-<br/>chan had figured it out. The best way to give Ranma<br/>his break-through was to use martial arts on him.<br/>Ranma's martial arts training would logically<br/>trigger martial arts responses, eventually. In a<br/>fair fight, Kane-chan didn't stand hardly a chance<br/>against a guy who'd spent all of his life doing<br/>little else BUT train.<p>But by sticking with things girls did, or at least<br/>things her idiot brother (and hopefully Ranma-kun,<br/>too) THOUGHT girls did, she put Ranma at a severe<br/>disadvantage. His code against fighting girls had<br/>been too well drilled into him.<p>And, Nabiki suspected, other techniques, as well,<br/>had him conditioned to save his potency for battle.<br/>Ranma wasn't just a virgin: He was incapable of<br/>responding like a normal man.<p>So much for Nabiki's own frustrations.<p>Nabiki looked at her sibling. Akane may have a<br/>chance to find the key. But Kaneda? She shook her<br/>head. Not unless inside Ranma's girl form there was<br/>a normal girl that could be released.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-kun stormed out of the living room, headed for<br/>the upstairs.<p>Kasumi called out, "Good night! Sleep well!"<p>Kane-chan dropped to the floor and sat like a guy,<br/>legs apart. "I'm so confused. I like her, but then<br/>she does something that sets me off."<p>Nabiki said, "It only means you have feelings for<br/>her. The question is do you have them for HIM, the<br/>guy?"<p>Kane-chan was visibly repulsed, "Like a guy-Like<br/>THAT!"<p>Standing by her, Nabiki put her hands on her knees,<br/>"But you're a GIRL. Remember the scandal factor.<br/>Remember how important a reputation is to a martial<br/>artist."<p>Kasumi went, "Oh, My!" as if to underline her point.<p>Kane-chan became serious. "...Reputation is all a<br/>school of martial arts has." They, like Ranma, had<br/>been kept in the dark about the Anything-Goes<br/>School's true reputation. (Luckily just vague rumors<br/>after all these years.) That more than anything else<br/>accounted for the number of students enrolled at the<br/>dojo. It was also why honor was so important to both<br/>families.<p>Kasumi tried to smile, "I'm glad to see the young<br/>lady does have modesty. Today's episode was an<br/>aberration."<p>(Nabiki said, "I doubt that.")<p>Kasumi smiled when she thought she'd found an<br/>explanation, "Akane was just glad to see her cousin<br/>after he'd returned from China!" Nabiki wondered how<br/>creative Big Sister would be able to be.<p>Kane-chan blinked. "She can accept that Ranma can<br/>change, but not me?"<p>Nabiki told her, "Ranma's not family." She smiled,<br/>"Yet."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi announced, "Dinner's ready."<p>Kane-chan frowned, "I'm not in the mood." Ignoring<br/>the gurgling in her stomach, she got up, "I'm going<br/>to bed."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, now where are we going to put<br/>you? The Saotomes are in the guest room."<p>Kane-chan got exasperated, and looked towards the<br/>ceiling, "I'm going where I ALWAYS go after I<br/>disappear out of sight, out of mind."<p>Nabiki waved a finger, "Unh, unh, uhn! You're not<br/>that mysterious girl any more. You have an identity.<br/>You're Akane Saotome. Kasumi isn't going to be<br/>forgetting about you now." She smiled, "Are you,<br/>Kasumi?"<p>Kasumi smiled sweetly for the guest, "Of course not!<br/>I could never forget the fiancée of man who's the<br/>girl my brother's engaged to."<p>It took a moment for Kane-chan to understand what<br/>Kasumi had said, "Can you repeat that again? That<br/>sounds just too weird."<p>Nabiki said, "That's what happens when you have<br/>people that change." She walked towards her.<p>Kane-chan suggested, "Wouldn't it be simpler on you,<br/>Kasumi, to think of Ranma as being two people, too?"<p>Nabiki gently took her by the shoulders and directed<br/>her out, "Let's not go there. Then Kasumi would have<br/>to find a place for Ranma-chan to stay."<p>Kane-chan smiled, "She could stay with me."<p>Nabiki shook her head, "Not after that little<br/>display just now." Pushing Kane-chan along towards<br/>the upstairs, she said to her older sister, "Kane-<br/>chan will stay with me, Kasumi. She has a sleeping<br/>bag. Don't you?"<p>Kane-chan nodded. "If I can find it."<p>Nabiki made a motion towards the back of Kane-chan's<br/>head. "It's times like this I wish I were more<br/>physical."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The clock said it was 10:39 pm. Kane-chan had STILL<br/>not gotten to sleep. And despite how tired she was<br/>it was looking like she wouldn't get any sleep. "At<br/>least not until I get out of this body. It's too<br/>lumpy! I can't get comfortable with hips, ass and<br/>boobs!" Her stomach's growl added another argument<br/>for getting up.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>She was in Kaneda's now oversized 'Star' pajamas.<br/>They were blue with yellow crossing lines and<br/>shorter diagonal ones. Over its one breast pocket it<br/>had a small tiger's head.<p>She walked with her thighs getting closer together.<br/>As she passed the lav, she wondered how she'd<br/>managed to go this long without going in there.<p>Inside she realized she would have to go as a girl.<br/>She had memories of a few experiments at that long<br/>ago, and Hiroshi and Daisuke's pictures of girls<br/>doing it for the camera. But there was a sink with<br/>hot water in the lav.<p>By the time the water had run long enough to raise a<br/>steam, Kane-chan could no longer endure the wait.<p>It was as bad as she thought it would be. She missed<br/>his manhood.<p>He wasn't ready to think of himself as a girl!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda went to the kitchen. His stomach was loud<br/>enough to echo in the inner hallway, now.<p>He turned on the light. The guy Ranma was there!<p>Kaneda's underdeveloped martial arts' sense warned<br/>him of the danger too late.<p>Ranma got up, "I see that you're finally a guy."<p>Kaneda needed an idea: "Shh! You'll wake everybody<br/>up! You ARE a guest in my house!"<p>Ranma glared, growled, and sat back down.<p>Kaneda was about to make his escape, but his stomach<br/>made its own growling noises.<p>He did his best to ignore the gaze burning into the<br/>back of his head. He had heard legends about those<br/>kinds of attacks.<p>Luckily, Ranma hadn't learned how to do that yet.<p>After taking out the salad bowl to look behind it,<br/>Kaneda found a couple of eggs and a bowl of red bean<br/>rice. Like most Japanese, Kasumi shopped regularly,<br/>and brought home what she could carry. There was<br/>little else in the fridge he felt like eating. Of<br/>course, it could've just been his instincts deciding<br/>for him.<p>Kaneda looked over at Ranma, "Did you eat ALL of the<br/>abalone?"<p>Ranma said, "There's just this one left," picking it<br/>up. He bent his head back, and opened his mouth.<p>Distracted by the image, he put the eggs and soup in<br/>the salad bowl. Annoyed, Kaneda asked, "Do you want<br/>some seaweed to go with that?"<p>Ranma said, "Sure! You got some?"<p>Frowning deeper, now, Kaneda said, "You know the<br/>abalone and kombu seaweed are supposed to be brought<br/>by the GROOM?"<p>Ranma nearly choked.<p>Kaneda came over, "Are you okay? Hey, I'm sorry.<br/>You're the guest." {What am I now, a guy or a girl?}<p>Ranma recovered by saying, "I'm also the man here,"<br/>referring to the custom of men being served first.<p>Though it galled him, which, no doubt, was why<br/>Ranma'd said it. But Kaneda decided not to argue.<br/>Kaneda sat down with what was left him.<p>Ranma eyed the bowl. "You eat salad?"<p>Kaneda noticed what he'd done. Ranma already thought<br/>he was an idiot. He needed a cover-up, "Sure! Do you<br/>think only girls eat salads?" Of course, there WERE<br/>two girls in the house. Kaneda wasn't ready to be<br/>the third. "Greens are good for your body. You sure<br/>know that as a martial artist."<p>Ranma told him, "Produce are bulky when you're<br/>travelin'. Rice-and-protein is the essential." Then<br/>he added, "Oh, and some cabbage against scurvy."<p>Kaneda poked his fork around in the mess, "No<br/>cabbage in here."<p>The reasonably well-fed Ranma smelled, then looked<br/>what the fork had come up with. "Is that red bean<br/>rice. You DO know that's definitive girl food?"<br/>Ranma knew that much about the Japanese custom, but<br/>he didn't know it was served to celebrate a girl's<br/>first period.<p>Kaneda got red, embarrassed and angry. He DID know<br/>about it being used to acknowledge that the<br/>threshold into womanhood had been crossed. He didn't<br/>remember, though, Kasumi had bought three cans of<br/>red beans seven years ago. This was the last one.<p>The best defense is an offense, "And I suppose just<br/>because I like eggs, that ALSO makes me a girl?"<p>Ranma was about to make a comment, but was stopped<br/>by a strange feeling. Food was another of Ranma's<br/>weak points, not quality, quantity. He liked eating.<br/>An association had been formed between food, Kaneda<br/>and girl.<p>The guy he saw was just the cursed form. Kaneda was<br/>really a girl. Kaneda had fought like a girl. And<br/>now Kaneda ate like a girl. Ranma wasn't able to<br/>figure why he was feeling the way he was, but he did<br/>feel the snare closing in around him.<p>Ranma escaped back upstairs.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The early spring morning had fog on the town.<br/>Despite a few hours lost sleep, Kaneda was out on<br/>his jog. He would do a left/right combination punch,<br/>sometimes bending to get in an uppercut, and<br/>occasionally he would throw in a side kick. Working<br/>out always made him feel better. He was able to turn<br/>off other thoughts, and worries and get into the<br/>zone of his movements.<p>By the time he entered the fortress-like gate of the<br/>Tendou compound he was so into his comfortable<br/>familiar routine he'd forgotten that the body he was<br/>using was the wrong one.<p>BERNGZZ!, "HHAA!", "Ranma!"
