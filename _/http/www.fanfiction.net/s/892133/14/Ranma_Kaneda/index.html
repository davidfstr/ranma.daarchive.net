</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>14: When Martial Artists Assemble!<p>The word was going around the Furinkan Assembly Hall:<br/>"Did you hear what Nabiki Tendou just said!"/ "She<br/>told Ranma Saotome something about "Welcome to my<br/>gender". What does that mean?"/ "It means, idiot of a<br/>boyfriend, she just let the cat out of the bag. Ranma can<br/>no longer pretend she's a guy."/ "I may be an idiot,<br/>but I never thought that cute redhead was a guy. Ow! Your<br/>elbow is sharp."/ "She has to be delusional to think<br/>people'll think she's a guy."/ "But look at the way she<br/>acts and dresses!"/ "Oh! Well, then. She is<br/>delusional."<p>The girl in the Chinese shirt and pants standing in the<br/>area between the front row and the stage threatened, "I'm<br/>gonna get you for this, Nabiki! NOBODY takes my manhood<br/>away!"<p>(Up on stage, new Acting-Headmaster Miss Hinako cried, "I<br/>sense battle aura! Oh, it's VERY naughty to fight in an<br/>auditorium!")<p>Nabiki, out of school uniform in slacks, shirt and<br/>necktie, calmly threatened back, "Free room and board,<br/>Kei Tendou!"<p>Ranma-chan yelled back, "I can LIVE without room and<br/>board-But not MY identity!"<p>(The little girl in the yellow dress herself threatened,<br/>"Miss Saotome! You will cease your violent tendencies at<br/>once!")<p>Kaneda was coming from his seat, ready to get between his<br/>fiancée and sister, "Ranma: You can take your fight with<br/>Nabiki home!"<p>Ranma-chan told him, "No, I can't! She shamed me in front<br/>of everybody here!"<p>(Miss Hinako produced something between her index and<br/>middle finger, "I warned you, Miss Saotome!")<p>Kaneda grabbed Nabiki under her thighs and back. She told<br/>him coldly, "Put me down. I can take care of myself."<p>Kaneda told her, "You can prove it outside-AWAY from all<br/>these bystanders!"<p>(Miss Hinako held the circle between her fingers at<br/>Ranma-chan, "...Happo 5-yen Satsu...")<p>Ranma-chan followed, "Only if she comes back and tells<br/>everybody the truth!"<p>(Miss Hinako was saying, "...Good girl's exercise step<br/>one...")<p>As the three headed for the door in the back, people in<br/>the audience like Daisuke and Hiroshi were getting out of<br/>their seats, "Come on! Let's watch the martial artists<br/>fight!"<p>Miss Hinako finished what she had to say, "...Ja! Byo!<br/>Tsu! Aku! Ma!" completing her arm's large circle in the<br/>air.<p>The three were out of the lobby and the outside doors<br/>ahead of the sickly green explosion without smoke but<br/>with dust that blew the inner auditorium doors against<br/>their wall.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The three were too wrapped up in their own concerns to<br/>notice what had happened:<p>Nabiki grabbed a handful of Kaneda's long, red hair and<br/>pulled. "I told you I can handle it."<p>Kaneda winced, "Ow, ow-kay!" He came to a stop and set<br/>his big sister down.<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "Now, I'm gonna see that you NEVER<br/>mess with my life again!"<p>Nabiki took her stance: At ease. "Some man!"<p>Ranma-chan stopped a meter close to her; "According to<br/>you-I'm NOT a man!"<p>Nabiki said as coolly as she could, "You are a man. When<br/>you're Kei Tendou."<p>Ranma-chan brought her fist back, ready to put real power<br/>into her blow. "I'm RANMA Saotome! Of the SAOTOME School<br/>of Martial Arts!"<p>Nabiki raised her chin bravely, and challenged her,<br/>"Then, Saotome, go ahead. Ruin a girl's pretty face, and<br/>life."<p>Ranma-chan told her, "I wil-l..." She snarled in<br/>frustration. This weak girl was no match for her! Ranma<br/>had to first fight a lifetime of the Code being drilled<br/>into her, with the reason WHY the Code was so important<br/>being demonstrated by the BAD example of her sensei, her<br/>pop...<p>But her rage didn't want the WORSE-than-dojo-destroyer<br/>get away with what she'd done. Ranma-chan lowered her<br/>fist, aiming it for her gut.<p>Nabiki said, "Go ahead. Destroy any baby that may be<br/>waiting to be born."<p>Ranma-chan nearly lost her fist. She screamed, "You don't<br/>have any baby!"<p>Nabiki looked at her with steady, level eyes, "How do you<br/>know? Do you even know how babies are made?"<p>Ranma-chan DID lose it: "Of COURSE I know!" Her face<br/>became red proving that she did. And further flustering<br/>her.<p>Nabiki suggested, "You could just cripple me." Then she<br/>took one of her dramatic turns, underplayed this time,<br/>"But what kind of a mother could I be like that?"<p>Through clenched teeth, Ranma-chan screamed, "N-n,<br/>Nyah!"<p>Kaneda thought, Nabiki, a mother? Ranma obviously<br/>doesn't know my sister at all. And this is not the time<br/>to tell Ranma about her.<p>There was screaming, as dozens and more behind them,<br/>mostly girls, ran out of the Assembly Hall. Among them<br/>were Sayuri and Yuka, "Kaneda! You guys! Something's<br/>happened to the guys inside!"<p>Sayuri cried, "You're martial artists! Maybe you can<br/>help!"<p>Yuka said, "What we NEED are doctors, nurses-MEDICS!"<p>Sayuri told her, "Then go get some! Meanwhile, what we<br/>have here is a guy who can fight whatever did, did-" She<br/>couldn't put her fears into words. Instead she grabbed<br/>Kaneda's arm and pulled, "Come on! Get in there and DO<br/>something!"<p>It took a second for Ranma-chan to be insulted. Then,<br/>"HEY! I'M a better martial artist than that jerk!" and<br/>ran to get ahead of them.<p>Nabiki let them go, "I'll stay here, and organize<br/>things!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Just entering the building gave everybody a bad feeling.<br/>It saturated the whole place.<p>In the auditorium, it looked like a scene out of "Night<br/>of the Multiplex Zombies". The center aisle and the rows<br/>near it were clogged with the bodies of mostly guys. Most<br/>of the girls with them looked as if they were with their<br/>boyfriends. Lucky of them, they were near the top of the<br/>pile. They were the ones doing the most groaning. Some<br/>were even lifting themselves up and off the guys. Ranma-<br/>chan said, "I guess whatever took out the crowd was<br/>focused mainly on the guys."<p>Away from the center, the bodies became less. There were<br/>guys draped over the backs of seats, wedged in seats, or<br/>upside down under the seats, their legs up in the air.<p>Those not further away from the center were hiding or<br/>cowering, stifling their cries of panic and fear. Those<br/>near the far aisles had or were making their way quickly<br/>but quietly towards the exit.<p>Behind Ranma-chan, Kaneda noted, "At least they're still<br/>breathing."<p>Sayuri was holding onto the back of his shirt; "That'<br/>good!"<p>Ranma-chan had completed her first reconnaissance, "It<br/>looks like the attack came down the center aisle, from in<br/>front of the stage."<p>Kaneda did his own survey, "It even got the teachers ON<br/>stage."<p>Sayuri said, "That poor little girl, Hinako! It looks<br/>like she's really hurt!"<p>Kaneda headed for the aisle to the right of center, "I'll<br/>check-"<p>Ranma-chan took his arm and halted him; "There's a faster<br/>way! AND I want to see what I can sense from the stage!"<p>Kaneda looked at her for a second. "You mean," he<br/>swallowed, "The Anything-Goes Obstacle Eliminator!"<p>Ranma-chan nodded, "You ARE able to at least do that!"<p>Kaneda frowned, his competency as a martial artist had<br/>just been challenged! "Okay! Let's do it!"<p>Sayuri asked, "What are you two talking..." She saw<br/>Kaneda take Ranma-chan by a wrist, and, then, squatted<br/>down to take her ankle in his other hand.<p>Kaneda lifted the small redhead up in the air-and start<br/>spinning her!<p>Sayuri did NOT want to believe her eyes, "An airplane<br/>ride! That fancy martial arts name was for a little<br/>stunt bigger kids do to littler kids!"<p>Kaneda pushed off one foot, pivoting around and around on<br/>one heel, building up momentum. While Ranma-chan said<br/>with clenched teeth, "I hate boobs."<p>Kaneda let go of small redhead, sending her flying:<br/>"Hyaah!" While Ranma-chan added, "-Make that all girl-<br/>fat!"<p>Sayuri shaded her eyes with her hand, "Ohoa!"<p>While the red Kaneda got redder, and a little angry with<br/>himself, I should've been able to throw Ranma<br/>straighter!<p>Ranma-chan went high over the bodies and seats on the<br/>slope of the auditorium. Bending her elbows sharply<br/>around her head and using her toes as ailerons, she made<br/>her body an airfoil.<p>She didn't go as far as she thought she should've gone in<br/>this lighter body. "A girl's body is a real drag!"<p>When she reached the top of her flight's arc, she saw<br/>that she wasn't going to make it past the third row. In<br/>fact she was going to land against hard seat edges, not<br/>soft bodies! "I KNEW Kaneda wasn't gonna be that good!"<p>Ranma-chan tucked herself in, and tumbled! Using her<br/>Saotome mid-air skills, her trajectory bent upward which<br/>in effect lengthened her flight. She was going to easily<br/>pass over the seats.<p>But, "Now I'm gonna hit the rim of the stage with my gut-<br/>-worse: My boobs!"<p>Quickly, Ranma-chan focused on the feel of a gymnastic<br/>springboard. She slammed her feet down onto air, and rose<br/>up into the air. She straightened her form out until she<br/>had come as high as she was going to go. She<br/>summersaulted, bring her feet around her head and back<br/>down.<p>Ranma-chan's feet did a perfect dismount on the stage<br/>beside the Hinako kid. She refused to do the hand<br/>flourish.<p>(There was a smattering of applause from the few that<br/>were conscious and paying attention.)<p>Ranma-chan did a quick, intense recon; the teachers on<br/>stage and in the wings were like the students out front.<br/>They weren't in ready to tell her what had happened. She<br/>had to look for the answers somewhere; she squatted down<br/>to examine the kid with the long, brown hair, in the<br/>yellow dress.<p>Only there was something different. She didn't look the<br/>way that Ranma remembered: "Hunh? I thought she was<br/>younger? She has breasts. They're not all that big, but<br/>there. Up close, she looks like a girl in junior high."<br/>Ranma-chan frowned at the thought. "She STILL shouldn't<br/>be put over high school students. It's an insult!"<p>Ranma-chan patted the adolescent's cheek, "Hey! Wake up:<br/>Tell me what happened!"<p>Hinako slowly opened her big, blue eyes.<p>Suddenly, the girl bolted away from Ranma-chan. Sitting<br/>straight up and pointing, she accused, "You attacked me,<br/>you bad delinquent!" (With her other hand she was<br/>reaching for something in one of her almost invisible<br/>pockets.)<p>Ranma-chan didn't like being accused of something she<br/>didn't do, "I did not! I came back to help!" She<br/>motioned towards the seats, "Look: Something took out the<br/>whole school!"<p>Hinako seemed to no longer distrust the redhead,<br/>"Something did?" She looked, and saw her students, who<br/>were just now coming to. She leaped to her flats,<br/>"Something did! Whoever did this is a very BAD person!"<br/>She raised a yen coin out in front of her, "They must be<br/>severely punished!"<p>Ranma-chan had rose to her own feet. "Oh-kay. But first<br/>tell me who it is."<p>Hinako was about to tell her. She then looked over her<br/>shoulder; "Don't you know?"<p>Ranma-chan almost did a face-fault. Steadying herself,<br/>she said, "That kid's useless." She looked around at the<br/>teachers that were waking up, too. "I'll ask an adult;<br/>somebody who CAN be responsible."<p>But before she could, Sayuri told her, "Traumatic<br/>situations often affect people's short-term memories!"<br/>She and Kaneda had jogged the long way, down the right-<br/>hand aisle.<p>Giving off sparks, a shrinking Hinako looked suspiciously<br/>at the two headed for the stage, "Who are these<br/>children?"<p>Sayuri said, "Me? I'm just part of the Greek chorus."<p>Kaneda asked, "The school teaches Greek songs?" Neither<br/>of them had been close enough to notice the girl getting<br/>smaller.<p>Hinako said, "A "Greek chorus" provides information and<br/>comments that the audience wouldn't otherwise hear. I'm<br/>also an English teacher."<p>Sayuri had to say, "I was just making a joke. (One I HAD<br/>thought would go over this little girl's head.)"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Take it easy, 'teach'; they came back<br/>to help, too. I guess we're gonna have to ask if anybody<br/>still has a memory of what happened." She saw that those<br/>that had fallen on the floor were now helping up those<br/>who were still down. She also saw that Hinako was back to<br/>looking like a little kid! Ranma-chan put her fingertips<br/>to her temple and shook her head; "Could my own memory<br/>have been affected by this fog of chi? I could have sworn she<br/>had... Well, that doesn't matter."<p>And Ranma-chan prepared herself; "What matters is-"<p>Hinako cried with a start, "Sirens! Somebody called the<br/>police and ambulances!"<p>Sayuri said, "Yuka!"<p>The Ninomiya kid's arms and legs became a hyperactive<br/>blur as she quickly ran to rally the teachers,<br/>"Outsiders! Outsiders! Rise and shine, all my teachers!<br/>We have to band together and protect the name of the<br/>school from Outsiders!"<p>Hearing that outsiders were coming to report on the way<br/>they ran things at the high school the faculty did rouse<br/>themselves. Mr. Fujiwara, the old history teacher called<br/>on them to, "Come together! We must provide a solid<br/>front! Furinkan is OUR domain!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Of course classes were late getting started. But by the<br/>middle of 2nd period all but a few of the students were<br/>now in their classrooms. Of course, that didn't mean they<br/>were studying.<p>It was like free time, with everybody asking questions,<br/>comparing notes, and offering opinions: "Nobody was<br/>hurt?"/ "Only those that bumped something when they<br/>fell."/ "Or had somebody fall on them-Owr, my back!"/<br/>"Speak for yourself. I feel weak and tired, like the<br/>energy has been drained from my body."/ "As opposed to<br/>when, Gosunkugi?"/ "Well, something happened. My skin<br/>is prickly, almost like it's sunburned."/ "Just your<br/>skin? Mine feels like it goes through me."/ "And I'm<br/>still seeing spots."/ "And you don't remember what<br/>happened, either?"/ "I remember getting whomped hard<br/>from behind."./ "-And feeling like a flat inner<br/>tube."/ "The last thing I remember is Nabiki Tendou<br/>getting up and saying something."/ "Something about,<br/>changing the dress code to allow Chinese clothes?"<p>More than one in the class looked towards Ranma-chan.<p>Things had been so busy, and hectic with people<br/>everywhere Ranma hadn't had an opportunity to get away.<br/>Ranma was still a girl. The redhead was lost in a<br/>thought, "There was something very suspicious about that<br/>energy I felt in the auditorium. If I didn't know better,<br/>I would think the place was filled with battle aura<br/>residue."<p>Ranma didn't want to sit still, so Kaneda had to stand<br/>by; he said, "I felt it, too. It was like when you walk<br/>into a place and just KNOW there was trouble. But it was<br/>low-grade trouble."<p>Ranma-chan confirmed with what her more highly trained<br/>senses had told her, "If I didn't know better, I would<br/>say that everybody that got hit were stoked by a fight."<p>Kaneda uncrossed his arms, "...But without the fighters!<br/>THAT'S what I was feeling!"<p>Sayuri had been trying to follow what the martial artists<br/>were discussing, "Do you think I might have the sense,<br/>too? It wasn't just seeing everybody like that; I felt<br/>the trouble. That's why I ran looking for you guys!"<p>Daisuke said, "If there was a fight, I'm surprised Sayuri<br/>wasn't with those who got flattened."<p>Sayuri told the jerk, "I've told you! I appreciate the<br/>ART, not the violence."<p>Hiroshi said, "Well, *I* don't appreciate the violence. I<br/>woke up folded in a seat three rows from where I started.<br/>And I mean FOLDED! It was like the water was wrung out of<br/>me."<p>Yuka asked, "But you weren't thirsty?"<p>Daisuke reminded everybody, "*I* was thrown into a pile<br/>of guys half way across the auditorium. I woke up with my<br/>head and shoulders under the dogpile."<p>Kaneda made no comment about his friend's smoldering<br/>anger. Kaneda's anger flared, and then was basically<br/>gone. Daisuke's seldom flared. And was seldom entirely<br/>gone.<p>Yuka asked, "Is it true about what Nabiki said about your<br/>father, Ranma?"<p>Sayuri told her friend, "Yuka, the topic is figuring out<br/>what happened."<p>Yuka said, "But I'm tired of that one. It scares me."<p>Hiroshi asked, "Yuka, you remember what Nabiki and Ranma<br/>were doing up front? Hardly anybody can tell us what<br/>happened then."<p>Yuka thought about what she thought she remembered,<br/>"Well, I guess it was because I wasn't interested in<br/>going to see Ranma, Kaneda, and Nabiki fight." She<br/>frowned at the two boys, "Like everybody who DID get<br/>wiped."<p>The class shifted its attention her way, just as the<br/>intercom was turned on: That Hinako kid announced, "The<br/>Tendous and Ranma Saotome are to report me. And you<br/>better not be late, if you don't want to be bad boys and<br/>a girl!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan and Kaneda were late. Or too late: The kid was<br/>gone from the office. She wasn't anywhere near the<br/>office. She was in the trees that separated the school<br/>buildings from the playing fields. When they saw her, she<br/>was patting one of the largest trees. When she turned<br/>around, the little girl happily said to them, "This will<br/>make the best one, don't you think?"<p>Ranma-chan didn't like playing 20 questions with a kid,<br/>"Best for what?"<p>Nabiki, back in her uniform, stepped into view, "Why a<br/>tree house, of course."<p>Ranma-chan didn't want to believe her ears, "A tree<br/>house?"<p>Kaneda asked, "I thought tree houses were more for, like,<br/>little boys."<p>Hinako smiled, already imaging it in her head, "Not when<br/>their gingerbread houses!"<p>Nabiki said, "I do hope she means gingerbread VICTORIAN<br/>houses; meaning with a lot of ornamental woodwork."<p>Little Hinako nodded, "Just like in the English fairy<br/>tails that first interested me in learning English!<br/>Fantasy themes make the BEST playhouses for girls!"<p>Nabiki said, "But this "playhouse" will be your office,<br/>right?"<p>Hinako managed to become serious, "My office will be in<br/>the best position to be on the lookout for delinquency!"<p>Kaneda and Ranma-chan briefly noted the number of trees<br/>all around. Well, if the little kid could get a tree<br/>house built on school property, how big of a problem<br/>would she have getting rid of a few trees so she could<br/>use her "Little Astronomer" telescope?<p>Ranma-chan said, "Whatever. So why did you get the office<br/>to call us out of class, 'Headmaster'."<p>Hinako asked, " "Headmaster"? I thought I was just the<br/>principal."<p>Before Ranma could tell the kid WHY she called her a<br/>"headmaster", Kaneda asked, "Does it have to do with what<br/>happened in Assembly Hall?"<p>Hinako said as if she just remembered, "Yes: That's what<br/>I wanted to ask!" She hurried over to Ranma-chan. "Did<br/>you see me! Did I really look too old to be a kid, but<br/>too young to be an adult! Did I, did I?"<p>Ranma-chan took a step back from the insistent kid, "Er,<br/>something like that. I THOUGHT I saw you lookin'<br/>different. I don't know how old you looked."<p>Hinako cried, "Yipee-eee!" and started running around<br/>hyper, "I CAN be in-between! I HAVE a chance to go to<br/>school like a normal child! I just have to find the<br/>way!"<p>Nabiki had become impatient; stepping in front of the<br/>little girl, she asked, "Wasn't there ANOTHER reason you<br/>called us?"<p>Hinako was still distracted by her own thoughts, "There<br/>was?"<p>Nabiki 'suggested', "Didn't you say something about Ranma<br/>Saotome being your "special project"."<p>Ranma Saotome cried, "YOU'RE the reason for that, AREN'T<br/>you!"<p>(Hinako stopped acting like a small child, "I sense<br/>battle spirit! It's very strong, very violent battle<br/>spirit!")<p>Kaneda put himself in front of Ranma-chan; he didn't<br/>think Nabiki could talk her way out of it THIS time.<br/>"Nabiki! You OWE Ranma! And you're going to settle up!"<p>Nabiki said, "Oh? What are you going to do? Hold me while<br/>Ranma "metes out some well-earned revenge" on me?"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "I don't NEED anybody's help to give<br/>you what I owe you!"<p>(Hinako cried, "I will NOT be ignored!" She held up a<br/>50-yen coin between two fingers, "Happo 50-yen Satsu!")<p>Green tendrils formed around the child's aura and went<br/>through the hole in the 50-yen piece. They reached out<br/>for the nearest battle aura they were aimed at.<p>That was Kaneda's.<p>Ranma-chan had decided to get around Kaneda's<br/>interference by leaping over him. And Hinako: Not wanting<br/>to involve a kid in the payback, Ranma-chan landed on the<br/>other side of Nabiki.<p>Before Nabiki, and even Ranma-chan could do anything,<br/>Kaneda cried out, "Wha, what's ha-ppen-ing...!"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "His battle aura! I can see his chi<br/>energy being pulled into the coin and out into-"<p>Ranma, Nabiki, and even the sapped Kaneda gasped: The<br/>child went through puberty and beyond in scant seconds!<br/>She went from a little girl around 8 or 9 and aged into a<br/>woman 27 or 28! There was no mistaking that this was the<br/>adult form of Miss Hinako, she looked just like what the<br/>girl would've been expected to look like when she grew<br/>up. And grow up she did: There was no mistaking that she<br/>HAD become an adult woman, the way her now too short and<br/>tight yellow dress clung to her statuesque curves. The<br/>beautiful woman would be any man's idea of what a mature<br/>woman SHOULD look like!<p>Kaneda fell to his knees before stunning woman. Dried out<br/>and emaciated but not thirsty, he couldn't will his martial<br/>arts sense of balance to keep from falling face down onto<br/>the ground before her feet.<p>Miss Hinako Ninomiya said, "I hope this will teach you to<br/>respect your principal."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "YOU! You're what happened in Assembly<br/>Hall this morning!"<p>Miss Hinako turned herself around. Lifting an eyebrow,<br/>she asked, "I am?"<p>Nabiki asked, "She is? Is she the reason for Kaneda being<br/>like that?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "I get it, now: You drained the battle<br/>aura out of TOO many would-be spectators. It was TOO much<br/>for your body to absorb, you overloaded, and blew their fight lust<br/>out of you back at them!"<p>Despite Ranma's threats to Nabiki, she'd been holding<br/>back. Seeing a truly capable opponent, Ranma's battle<br/>aura intensified to serious levels. She was ready to take<br/>on the person who'd laid out hundreds of students!<p>Miss Hinako said, "You exude violent power! For the peace<br/>of this school, I will take it away from you!" And she<br/>held out the coin again.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "MY violent power!" But she held<br/>herself back from attacking.<p>Ranma-chan studied her actions intensely. She was tensed,<br/>her body ready to make her own move at the last moment.<br/>First she had to learn as much about the transforming<br/>girl's technique as she could. The better she understood<br/>her opponent, the better she would be prepared to counter<br/>her attack. If not this one, future ones.<p>Miss Hinako said, "Happo 50-yen Satsu/Obliteration!"<p>Her aura's tendrils again reached through the coin for<br/>the closest aura it was aimed at...<p>Ranma-chan shoved Nabiki into them, "Here! You brought<br/>her here! You should pay the bill!" But more important<br/>than her revenge, it would give Ranma a chance to study<br/>exactly how Ninomiya's technique affected its victim! If<br/>only she hadn't been distracted when Kaneda was tapped.<p>What happened was... Nothing. The tendrils could barely<br/>hold onto Nabiki's aura; the yellow-green energy it<br/>brought out was dim and washed out.<p>...And all the while, Nabiki stood there as self-<br/>possessed as ever looking somewhat disdainfully at the<br/>older woman. When it was apparent nothing would happen,<br/>Nabiki asked, "Is it Ranma's turn, now?"<p>Miss Hinako turned her coin on Ranma, "You KNEW that was<br/>going to happen."<p>Ranma-chan said, "I did?"<p>Miss Hinako told her, "You should have taken the<br/>opportunity to flee while you could."<p>Ranma-chan told her, "I DON'T run from a fight!"<p>Miss Hinako told her, "Yes, I see it all clearly now.<br/>Your battle aura is proof that you are a delinquent. I<br/>see it was no mistake that you were made my special<br/>project."<p>Ranma-chan protested, "What do you MEAN "special pro-"-<p>Miss Hinako cried, "Happo 50..."<p>Ranma-chan dodged and summersaulted away faster than she<br/>could say her words. On her way back to her feet, Ranma-<br/>chan had a pebble in her fingers. Even before she had<br/>regained her footing, Ranma-chan flicked the pebble at<br/>slingshot force at the coin.<p>The coin was knocked out from between the woman's<br/>fingers.<p>Ranma-chan watched it land far enough away that with HER<br/>speed, she could easily reach it first (if Miss Hinako<br/>WAS as unprepared for real exertion as she looked).<br/>Ranma-chan said, "Ha! Bet you're not so "respectable"<br/>without your magic coin!"<p>Miss Hinako said, "You'd lose that bet, delinquent!" She<br/>held up her hands and brought thumb-to-thumb, index-to-<br/>index fingers. Looking through the circle they formed,<br/>she cried, "Happo Tsurisen Gaeshi/Happy Change Returned!"<p>Ranma-chan was struck full on by a blast from a small<br/>exploding yellow-green star! It came into her and threw<br/>her from the inside, her outside only following!<p>Feeling sunburned from the bone out, Ranma-chan landed<br/>like a puppet-doll, meters away. Strangely, her breasts<br/>and buttocks hurt the least. They were the furthest from<br/>her core.<p>As Ranma-chan lay there, gathering her fighting spirit<br/>from where it had been blown out of her, Miss Hinako came<br/>to squat near her. The woman was gone; it was the little<br/>girl patted Ranma's cheek, "You're the reason I agreed to<br/>come here, My Special Project!" And she looked beyond the<br/>redhead and frowned; sounding like a petulant little<br/>child, she said, "I'll SHOW them I can, too, reform bad<br/>girls and boys!"<p>Nabiki now stood beside her; looking down, she said, "If<br/>I remember correctly, you said you've ALREADY cleaned up<br/>two reform schools."<p>Miss Hinako pouted, "But I didn't REFORM them. My change<br/>didn't change them. All I did was tame them. I only<br/>sealed them off from all fighting energy so they couldn't<br/>use it again."<p>Nabiki was startled, "You can do that?" It was clear this<br/>was not something she had planned on. She actually seemed<br/>concerned for others, and perhaps Ranma, as well.<p>Miss Hinako suddenly smiled, and became very pleased with<br/>herself, "I can do all sorts of things with auras! I'm a<br/>good girl!"<p>Nabiki said seriously, "Let's hope so."<p>Kaneda had recovered enough to have joined them; "WHAT<br/>sorts of things! What do you MEAN seal off! HOW do<br/>you plan to "reform" Ranma! WHY wasn't Nabiki<br/>affected, too!"<p>The little girl put her hands to the ears buried under<br/>her long, brown hair, "Too many questions! I'm tired of<br/>thinking about my power! I want to do something else!"<br/>She looked at Nabiki, "Do you want to play with me?"<p>Nabiki said, "Uh... Ranma's your special project,<br/>remember?"<p>Miss Hinako said, "That's right!" And she put her hands<br/>on her knees as she bent over Ranma, "Do you want to play<br/>a game with me? Do you have any toys? Do you want to<br/>play tag?"<p>Ranma-chan felt her fighting spirit coming back to her,<br/>"No! I don't want to play!"<p>Kaneda stepped in, "Er, we have to get back to class! It<br/>is, Miss Hinako, still school time."<p>The little girl straightened up, "You're right. It is the<br/>time for all good children to be in school. And I'm the<br/>principal; it's the time for me to be in school, too."<br/>Then she asked, "Perhaps we can play after school?"<p>Ranma-chan told her, rising to her elbows, "You have got<br/>to be kidding, you little-" Kaneda flipped a coin into<br/>her open mouth, forcing her to close it.<p>While Ranma-chan tried to cough the 5-yen piece out,<br/>Kaneda said, "Miss Hinako, WE'RE martial artists! After<br/>school we have to do are kata drills, practice spars, and<br/>endurance exercises. That on top of all the homework we<br/>have to do! Of, er, course, if YOU want to join us in our<br/>routines..." he did a silent prayer that he hadn't gone<br/>too far.<p>Miss Hinako wrinkled her little nose, "That doesn't sound<br/>like fun."<p>Nabiki told her, "That's right. Nothing a little girl<br/>would be interested in."<p>Miss Hinako sighed, "Sometimes I wish I wasn't little. I<br/>wish I were an adult."<p>Ranma-chan finally spit out the coin. Getting one deep<br/>breath, she was up on her feet, clutching Kaneda by his<br/>shirt front, "Why you, I ought to pound you for that!"<p>Miss Hinako was on alert, "Spontaneous aggression!"<p>Ranma-chan screamed, " "Spontaneous"!"<p>Kaneda wrapped an arm around Ranma-chan's waist, "It's<br/>okay, Miss Hinako! We're engaged! You know how some<br/>couples are, uh, don't you?" How much of a little kid was<br/>she?<p>Ranma-chan hit Kaneda's hand at a nerve junction, forcing<br/>it off of her hips, "Don't "couple" me." Then she told<br/>him, "Pathetic! Afraid of a little girl."<p>Nabiki said, "Excuse Ranma, Miss Hinako. She's a bit slow<br/>on the uptake."<p>Miss Hinako agreed, "Delinquents have a hard time<br/>learning! That's why they're delinquents. I shall set up<br/>a remedial program for her."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "What do you mean HER!"<p>The school bell rang. Nabiki said with a trace of humor,<br/>"Saved by the bell. You'd better get back to class,<br/>Ranma. You don't want to get any further behind in your<br/>study. How many years is it, now?"<p>Kaneda told her, "Nabiki! I thought you KNEW better."<p>Nabiki said, "I know that students are TESTED first<br/>before they're put in any special program."<p>Ranma-chan asked suspiciously, "And YOU'RE offerin' to<br/>help me pass this test!"<p>Nabiki was pleased her little tactic had sidetracked<br/>Ranma away from a confrontations over her sex; "ONLY if<br/>you want me to. But I guarantee you I CAN help any NORMAL<br/>person pass a test."<p>Miss Hinako said, "Hurry, Children! You mustn't be late<br/>for your classes!" Luckily she didn't hear the hint of<br/>cheating in Nabiki's offer.<p>Nabiki said, "And you'll want to get back to planning<br/>your office. These trees will be perfect for it. Aren't<br/>there woods in many fairy tales?"<p>Miss Hinako bounced up and down in place, "Oh, yes! And<br/>I shall decorate my office with stars, and flowers, and<br/>giraffes and..." Apparently her idea of "fairy tales" had<br/>shifted over to that in "Hello, Kitty".<p>All that outpouring kawaii energy was just too much for<br/>the chi-sensitive Ranma to take. She retreated.<p>Nabiki, on the other hand, was more sensitive to Ranma-<br/>chan's barely suppressed energy. She decided to humor the<br/>new principal a while longer. "You know, as Headmaster of<br/>a HIGH school, I think it'd be a good idea if your office<br/>had more of an "institutional" look..."<p>Miss Hinako said, "Hmm, yes, you're probably right."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan went looking for hot water. "That does it! If<br/>I'm gonna be 'reformed', it's gonna be 'cause I'm a<br/>pervert GUY! Let her 'teach me' not to be a girl."<p>Kaneda ran beside her, "You actually think she's a<br/>threat!"<p>Ranma-chan growled, "Not a threat: A menace! Imagine<br/>somebody teachin' a dangerous technique like those to a<br/>little kid! Why not give her a loaded bazooka!"<p>Kaneda asked, "Are you sure it's a technique, and not<br/>her?"<p>Ranma-chan had reached the door that led to the shoe<br/>lockers. "Of course it's a technique! She gets into her<br/>position, gives the name, and makes her move! Don't YOU<br/>do your techniques that way?"<p>Kaneda said, "Yes. (Even though I've always thought it<br/>was a stupid thing to do; it tells your opponent exactly<br/>what he has to counterattack.)" As they were headed for<br/>the lockers they'd left their indoor shoes, Kaneda asked,<br/>"Who WOULD teach a little kid those reckless skills?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Somebody who HATES adults! She drains<br/>the energy out of you so you can't get away from her<br/>Candyland World."<p>Kaneda said, "Make that "Cocoa Land", as in "koukou",<br/>Japanese for high school?"<p>Ranma-chan went right through the shoe locker area<br/>without stopping. "I not in the mood to laugh."<p>Kaneda asked, "But she's after delinquents, not adults."<br/>They WERE going to track mud like delinquents.<p>Ranma-chan told him, "Delinquents think they know better<br/>than adults, think they act better than adults!<br/>Delinquents are SUPER adults. They'd hate her elementary<br/>cartoon playland WORSE than adults!"<p>Kaneda followed, "I guess that makes sense. And if she<br/>absorbs their negative aura, her positive, innocent<br/>energy protects her!"<p>Ranma-chan was headed towards the office, "Like I said,<br/>her "sugar-and-spice-and-everything-nice" suffocates the<br/>rest!"<p>Kaneda thought he understood, "But until it does, she has<br/>to grow up. Being an adult is a negative."<p>Ranma-chan told him, "NOT to me it ain't! -And bein' a<br/>guy AIN'T, either!"<p>Kaneda realized, "What, a guy isn't... Of course: That's<br/>it! Guys ARE negative! THAT'S why Nabiki wasn't affected!<br/>-And that's why hardly any of the girls were affected in<br/>Assembly Hall! She gets her energy source from the<br/>negative side of yang!" Over all yang was positive to<br/>yin's negative; but not all male things were positive.<p>Ranma-chan stopped in front of a room near the office.<br/>She spun around, "Good! Then that means I'm REALLY a guy,<br/>even when I don't LOOK like one! 'Cause she hit me real<br/>good with that "Happo Change Returned" attack, as hard as<br/>the other guys got hit!" And she spun around to go into<br/>the room.<p>Kaneda read and asked, "Why are you going into the<br/>"Faculty Room"?"<p>Ranma-chan told him as she went inside, "It's my first<br/>act as a delinquent: And I'm STEALIN' a teakettle! Let<br/>that brat "reform" a girl she can't find!"<p>As the hydraulic arm eased the door shut behind Ranma-<br/>chan, Kaneda said casually, "I wonder if AKANE Saotome<br/>can learn Miss Hinako's martial arts techniques."<p>No sooner had the door closed than it opened again.<br/>Ranma-chan asked, "...learn new martial arts<br/>techniques?..."<p>Kaneda said, "More powerful ones than any I've seen you<br/>use." He took the teakettle from Ranma-chan, "Thank<br/>you," and poured its hot water on herself. She was back<br/>in her Furinkan girls' uniform.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Hey! I got that!"<p>"Akane" handed the kettle back, "There's still enough in<br/>there to change back into a guy. Bye! I'm off to see<br/>Little Miss Small Change." She passed one of the<br/>secretaries in the hall.<p>Ranma-chan struggled with herself. But in the end it came<br/>down to what was the most important thing in her life. If<br/>she had been a guy at the time, she may have made a<br/>different choice. But she was using a girl's brain.<br/>"Here!" she said, pushing the kettle into the secretary's<br/>hands.<p>As Ranma-chan sped back the way they'd come from, she<br/>muttered to herself, "I KNOW I'm gonna regret this. But<br/>if it means bein' a better martial artist, I GOTTA take<br/>the chance!" And taking chances was what being a martial<br/>arts master was all about.<p>Ranma-chan called out to her rival, "Why do YOU have to<br/>be a girl?"<p>"Akane" told her, "If her power DOES feed off of negative<br/>male energy, it only makes sense that a FEMALE would<br/>attract it!"<p>Ranma-chan grumbled at the logic, "I hope that doesn't<br/>mean I hafta be POSITIVE about bein' female."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>They passed Nabiki near the stairs up to the classrooms.<br/>"What in the world? What do those two idiots think<br/>they're up to?" She called out, "Kane-chan, you KNOW<br/>you're not registered as a student?"<p>"Akane" told her, "Miss Hinako doesn't know that! By the<br/>time she does, maybe I'll have the secret to her<br/>techniques!"<p>Ranma-chan had caught up with and was passing "Akane";<br/>"HA! Ranma Saotome IS registered! I'll be able to stay<br/>around the brat, when YOU can't, Mr. Absent!"<p>It was Kane-chan's turn to growl at the unfairness of it<br/>all.<p>Nabiki headed up to Classroom 2-E shaking her head. "All<br/>that over a martial arts technique. I'm glad they don't<br/>know about MY special technique." Then she had a thought<br/>that really made her glad they didn't know about it, "If<br/>Ranma had known I used it on her today-twice, no less,<br/>she would've countered it and KILLED me. And my technique<br/>must be the reason Miss Hinako's didn't affect me."<br/>Unlike SOME idiots, I will be not blurt out the name of<br/>MY technique. I'm not telling anybody I even HAVE a<br/>secret technique.<p>The End of this chapter<br/>[Okay. Ranma and Kaneda misunderstand a lot about Miss<br/>Hinako. They are right, though, that girls ARE less<br/>susceptible to her techniques. Study what happens to the<br/>girls verses the guys in the Takahashi-sama stories.]<p>[And both Miss Hinako and I don't want to be visiting<br/>kiddieland any more than the story says we have to.]
