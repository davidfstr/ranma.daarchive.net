</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>06: The Answer<p>The wind blew the black haired and the Furinkan girls'<br/>uniform of the girl kneeling in the grassy field. A<br/>paper-wrapped bouquet of long-stemmed red roses where<br/>cradled in her arms. She was in a daze. Never before in<br/>her life had she felt like such a girl.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>A large, handled pan dropped from a tree several<br/>meters from the girl. A black-and-white panda climbed<br/>down it. A water balloon was carefully held in its mouth.<br/>When its hind legs touched the ground, it stood upright.<p>It then took the balloon with the hot water inside<br/>between its front paws and easily popped it.<p>A wet Genma Saotome in his kempo-gi replaced the animal.<br/>His gaze was fixed on the girl, 'Akane Saotome'. "It<br/>appears Nabiki Tendou's plan has worked. I hope so. I'd<br/>hate to think I had to rent my panda from out for<br/>something that didn't."<p>He took one last good look at the girl, then turned to<br/>loose himself among the other trees.<p>He returned to pick up the pan, "Kasumi will need this to<br/>prepare her wonderful meals. And I may need it to hold<br/>more hot water balloons."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>On his way back to the Tendou's, Genma thought of earlier<br/>that day:<p>In the late afternoon, the panda was sitting halfway<br/>outside the garden hall doorway. It was waiting for the<br/>roto-rooterman to finish clearing the drains so it, at<br/>last, could have a hot bath. That's where Soun's youngest<br/>daughter had found him. Nabiki, still in her school<br/>uniform, said, "Mr. Saotome, I have information that may<br/>interest you greatly. It concerns your, uh, son: Ranma."<p>"Bran-ba?"<p>Nabiki, "But as the saying goes, "One does not really<br/>know the value of something, until one has to pay for<br/>it". I offer you this information to you for 1,000 yen.<br/>If you don't have the money, I will take it in services."<p>The panda frowned at her. "Bbbraa," it grumbled.<p>Before the customer let itself off the hook, Nabiki<br/>produced an envelope with [To Ranma Saotome] written on<br/>it. She told the panda, "It's a challenge letter." The<br/>saleswoman in her held up her hand to hold off any<br/>comment, "I know Ranma has received letters before, but<br/>THIS boy thinks Ranma is a girl."<p>The panda suddenly showed interest, "Berar!"<p>Nabiki kept it out of its reach, "That would mean Ranma<br/>would have to answer the challenge as a girl, wouldn't<br/>it?" Receiving no denial from the animal, she continued<br/>on, "This boy ALSO believes that if he loses, Ranma will<br/>have to go out on a date with him."<p>The panda's eyes widened.<p>She tempted the panda with the envelope, "The usual<br/>information of when and where the challenge will be is<br/>all in here. Now, do we have a bargain?"<p>A large sweatdrop formed on the panda's head. But it<br/>nodded its agreement.<p>As she handed the envelope to the panda, she said, "By<br/>the way, I couldn't find Ranma. Officially, he doesn't<br/>know about the challenge."<p>The panda glared at the girl. It looked like it might<br/>take a swipe at her.<p>Nabiki smiled, "But that doesn't mean 'she' might not<br/>hear it from others. And it DEFINITELY doesn't mean the<br/>boy in question won't challenge 'her' again. If anything,<br/>Kuno-baby is persistent.<p>"Unless, that is, there's somebody ELSE to take Ranma's<br/>place in his heart."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>In the florescent streetlight, Genma in the present shook<br/>his head, "Imagine selling out one of your family like<br/>that." He had a policy of forgetting about those times<br/>he'd sold his son. "But I can't say I disapprove of it in<br/>this instance. I have overlooked Ranma's current<br/>challenge because I have faith that I have raised a true<br/>man among men."<p>He frowned behind his glasses, "But I can't say same<br/>about how Soun has raised HIS son. From everything I've<br/>seen, Kaneda is just as undisciplined as any typical boy<br/>you find these decadent days." His expression went from<br/>disapproval to grim approval of what he'd done about it,<br/>"And since she isn't a man, she might as well be a girl.<br/>I've told Ranma that often enough."<p>He paused on the other side of the Tendou's fortress<br/>gate. "But that's not the kind of 'girl' Ranma needs.<br/>More than ever, his woman has to be like his mother, one<br/>who won't blur the clear line between the sexes. Not some<br/>cross-dressing..." Genma's adjustment to the curse had<br/>been sidetracked during this early, fragile stage. While<br/>he had held fast to Ranma's true gender, he couldn't look<br/>beyond Kaneda-kun's normal outer appearance. And the boy<br/>they had to live with couldn't look beyond Ranma's girl<br/>form. Genma recognized a crush. But Ranma hadn't<br/>responded by beating that crap out of the boy. It made<br/>Genma start to question his faith in Ranma.<p>He paused. He took a deep breath, and released it.<br/>"Remember, you're the guest in this house. Like it or<br/>not, Kaneda is as yet still Soun's son and heir."<p>Genma smiled, "Meanwhile, there are two daughters who<br/>know how to be female." (Though, he was having doubts<br/>about Nabiki.) He strolled through the gate, his eyes<br/>seeing a bright future, "And once Ranma is married to a<br/>Tendou girl, then we can worry about WHO is to be the<br/>heir to the dojo."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The flowers left on the field, Kane-chan hurried through<br/>the back gate of her family's compound? She closed it<br/>with her back. She rested against it for a moment to<br/>catch her breath.<p>As she did, she glared down at the thing she had on. It<br/>was too dark to see clearly in the shadow of the<br/>compound's wall, but she could certainly feel it. "Stupid<br/>dress! Stupid wind-resistance! Flapping around like that!<br/>If girls want to run around with naked legs, why can't<br/>they just wear shorts!" It was a complaint she'd had<br/>before. The only thing that kept it from being worse was<br/>that she wasn't wearing skimpy panties. She still had on<br/>her usual boxers.<p>She stood up; she was getting back to a comfortable<br/>breathing rate. She put her hand on her chest, "Ohr,<br/>running without a bra is never a good idea." She had been<br/>a girl often enough to know their practical uses. But a<br/>guy can't wear one that'd do any good for a girl. Even if<br/>I could, I'd never survive what it would do to my<br/>reputation. I might as well BE a girl, then.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan was so mad, she slammed the kitchen door and<br/>didn't even acknowledge Kasumi's greeting. (She had,<br/>though, kicked the girls' sneakers off outside the door.)<p>As she was leaving, Kasumi told her, "Supper will be<br/>ready soon! Will you tell Nabiki to clear the table?"<p>Kane-chan turned from her way to the bedrooms upstairs,<br/>and went to the family room.<p>Kane-chan stood there for a moment, focusing her<br/>animosity.<p>Nabiki was on the other side of the table. Her books were<br/>spread out on it. One of them wasn't a schoolbook. It was<br/>an accounting ledger. She looked up from the other side<br/>of the table and offered, "A yen for your thoughts."<p>Kane-chan stormed across to where she'd been obviously<br/>waiting for HER (female), "I THOUGHT you said Ranma was<br/>going to be there!"<p>Nabiki sat back on a hip, tucking her pants-covered knees<br/>under her. "Did you actually HEAR me say I got the<br/>message to Ranma? I think not, though I tried." THAT,<br/>after all, was what Kuno-baby contracted her to do (for a<br/>nice fee of 1,000 yen). "I DID tell your classmates to<br/>give her the message if they saw her." Of COURSE there<br/>was nothing in the verbal contract that said she had to<br/>make actually contact with Ranma.<p>Kane-chan bent over her and held up a small fist, "So you<br/>decided you'd deliver the next-best-thing to Kuno!"<p>AND informed Kuno ahead of time. Nabiki kept her poker<br/>face, "I delivered the next-best-opponent. How was I to<br/>know you were going to show up as a girl?" And the<br/>loophole was she didn't KNOW. But because Akane did,<br/>she'd get to keep the 10,000-yen finder's fee from Kuno-<br/>baby.<p>Kane-chan drew back the fist she used to break cinder<br/>blocks, "I ought to!"<p>Nabiki said calmly, "Uh, uh! Remember, "The strong should<br/>not pick on the weak"."<p>Kane-chan said sourly, Nabiki weak! "Only physically.<br/>Only physically." She HAD been tempted to see how close<br/>she could come to her sister's face. But, in the end,<br/>Nabiki WAS her sister.<p>Kane-chan turned and stomped out of the room. Rrr! If I<br/>did try it, I KNOW she wouldn't give me the satisfaction<br/>of even pretending to flinch!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi was in Kane-chan's way, wiping off her hands on a<br/>dishtowel. Kasumi asked, "Your fight didn't go well,<br/>Akane?"<p>A red-faced Kane-chan turned sideways to get by her older<br/>sister, "There wasn't a fight."<p>Kasumi said, "I'm sorry to hear that. I know how<br/>important fighting is to you."<p>Kane-chan walked backwards as she told her, "Fighting is<br/>not important to me: It's important to the dojo! This is<br/>kempo! What do you think we're selling! Fighting is<br/>advertising!" In kempo, technique came first, then the<br/>applications.<p>Kasumi said, "It was because you were a girl, wasn't it,<br/>Akane?"<p>Kane-chan said ironically, "Oh, you could say that." She<br/>spun around and picked up her pace.<p>Kasumi followed, "If you'd like to talk about it..."<p>Kane-chan stayed long enough on the stairs to say, "Look,<br/>Kasumi, I'm just not comfortable talking to you like<br/>this. I have to get out of these clothes, and out of this<br/>body. If you have anything to say, say it to your<br/>brother."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>In her red-and-white striped shirt, Kane-chan pulled at<br/>the Kaneda's jeans. "Hm-rr! They're a size<br/>larger around, but they don't hit the hips and butt<br/>right." But they were tight along what to her were thick<br/>thighs. Below them, they became loose. "And look how long<br/>they are. I'm nearly 18 cms/7 inches shorter. It's a<br/>wonder I haven't trip over my pants every time I change!"<p>She looked for her belt. She found that the jeans wanted<br/>to pinch in the wrong places. "What's wrong all of a<br/>sudden! Any other time I just have to cinch up my belt,<br/>and..."<p>It hit her: "Kasumi!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>"Kasumi!" On the way downstairs, the jeans told Kane-<br/>chan visiting the lav was her first priority.<p>While she waited for the hot water to come out of the<br/>sink's tap, she also realized, "Why didn't I do this this<br/>afternoon! THEN I wouldn't have changed in front of<br/>Kasumi and tore that uniform. And if I HADN'T done all<br/>of that, I bet I wouldn't have ended up in a dress in front<br/>of Kuno!<p>"Rrrr! It IS a curse! If it can't get somebody else to<br/>get you wet, it makes you stupid enough to do it to<br/>yourself!"<p>Out of sheer frustration, she grabbed the sides of the<br/>sink and dunked her head in the steaming hot water. "Ow!<br/>I've got to remember to remember! Ow! Remember,<br/>Stupid! Ow! Don't forget!..."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi was bringing a tray with platters of eel teriyaki<br/>and vegetables from the kitchen into the family room when<br/>Kaneda came bounding down the stairs. "Kasumi! I bet you<br/>know the reason I met Kuno in a dress today!"<p>Kasumi paused, "I don't know the reason." She smiled,<br/>and headed into the family room, "I just know it works."<p>The redhaired Kaneda followed her, "Aha! You did do it!"<p>His dad said, "Now, Kaneda, that's no way to talk to your<br/>older sister."<p>Kaneda stopped to frown at the man. "Welcome back to the<br/>land of the conscious. It took you long enough to come<br/>out of your 'trance'." Now that he knew part of the<br/>truth, he wasn't convinced Dad's spells weren't just an<br/>excuse not to face him with the rest of it.<p>Kasumi asked, "Please, Kaneda! That is no way to talk to<br/>Father. And in front of company, too."<p>Kaneda looked. All he saw was Mr. Saotome. "Ranma's not<br/>here."<p>Nabiki said, "That's obvious."<p>Kaneda told her, "Quiet! I'm not through with you,<br/>Nabiki! But first," he strode to where his oneesan was<br/>serving supper, "How did you get that dress on me?"<p>His dad said, "Kaneda! Kasumi would never think to make<br/>you wear a dress! She knows you're a man!"<p>Kaneda wanted to yell, "Only because I'm, I am..." He<br/>couldn't yell. He knew he was cursed, but he was usually<br/>a girl when he felt most cursed.<p>Soun Tendou started getting that far away look in his<br/>eye. "I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about,<br/>son."<p>Kaneda did yell, "Son!" He COULD be angry for a<br/>lifetime of silence from a man who was supposed to be his<br/>male role model.<p>Soun hid behind his forearm and cried, "He yelled at me!"<p>Kasumi stopped serving. (Unfortunately she'd set the tray<br/>down in front Mr. Saotome.) "Kaneda! I will not answer<br/>ANY questions until you apologize to Father."<p>Gritting his teeth in familiar frustration, Kaneda said,<br/>"I, formally, apologize." But I'm not sorry.<p>Kasumi smiled for him, "That's better." She turned to<br/>their houseguest, "Mr. Saotome? What happens to your<br/>clothes when you turn into a panda?"<p>His mouth full, Genma Saotome looked up. He swallowed. He<br/>then smiled, and orated, "Ah! That's an interesting<br/>question. I've wondered that myself since I fell into<br/>that spring. I DO know that they are the clothes I was<br/>wearing before I changed. See this?" he asked, pushing<br/>out his gi coat with a thumb under the opening, "This is<br/>a stain that I got eating barbequed octopus balls."<p>Kasumi looked, "Oh, my. I'll have to clean that for you."<p>Still upset, Kaneda said, "What does he having barbequed<br/>octopus balls have to do with ME wearing a dress!"<p>Dad said, "There he goes again! Where have I failed!<br/>Genma, do not think my son is like this! It's just a<br/>momentary aberration! You know about teenagers and their<br/>fads!" Then he broke down and started weeping, "But<br/>dresses!"<p>Kaneda defended himself, "It wasn't MY idea to wear the<br/>damned dress!"<p>Nabiki played audience and impassive critic. "I hope this<br/>is confusing enough. How many tangled conversations can<br/>be followed at the same time?"<p>Kasumi said, "I will admit it was my idea. I replaced the<br/>duplicate-"<p>Kaneda interrupted, " "Duplicate"!<p>Kaneda got a pleased smile, "Yes. I've made sure that<br/>you've had two sets of just about all of your outfits.<br/>One that will fit you, as you are now, and a second for<br/>when you..." She looked at her still crying father, and<br/>didn't finish the sentence. He decided to take it<br/>outside.<p>Nabiki said, "And THAT'S why I don't have a bigger<br/>clothing allowance."<p>Kasumi gently chided her younger sister, "Now, Nabiki,<br/>you know I've been very frugal. Most of those outfits are<br/>the same as he was wearing when he was younger. That way<br/>I just had to take those Kaneda had outgrown and altered<br/>them to fit, uh, Kaneda's alternative form." Though out<br/>in the garden, her father could hear. That is, if he<br/>cared to.<p>Nabiki accused, "But it wasn't that way for a couple of<br/>years, there!"<p>Kasumi said, "Yes, there was a time when Kaneda was<br/>shorter than, uh, er, boys of that age."<p>Nabiki smirked, "And more developed."<p>Kasumi said, "That was the time that Kaneda started to<br/>need outfits of different sizes. That was the time I<br/>started my duplication project. It was encouraging that<br/>Kaneda appreciated my work."<p>Kaneda said, "Appreciated it? I didn't even know you<br/>were doing it!"<p>Kasumi smiled on him, "I just had to give you the idea<br/>'if only'. You knew where to look for a change of outfits<br/>when you needed one."<p>Kaneda thought about it. " "...know where to look for a<br/>change of" -You mean in the-" Suddenly he stopped<br/>himself, as he glared at Nabiki.<p>Nabiki said, "You don't think I haven't known about the<br/>locked chest for years?"<p>Kasumi said, "But things are different, now, Nabiki. I<br/>expect you to give me ALL of the keys you've made. You've<br/>respected Father's and my wishes up to now, as far as I<br/>know. But with the change of circumstances, I can't be<br/>sure you'll continue doing so."<p>Nabiki was about to talk her way into keeping one key,<br/>but decided not to. She hung her head, "Yes, Kasumi." If<br/>she pushed it, the loopholes would be closed.<p>Genma said, after finishing off his, Ranma's and the<br/>still crying Soun's meals, "But where do MY clothes go to<br/>and from?"<p>Nabiki said, "Isn't it obvious? It has to be your<br/>traveling pack. Isn't that where your clothes would be<br/>when you're not using them?"<p>Kasumi told her sister, "And you are NOT to replace<br/>Ranma's things with anything that doesn't belong there,<br/>either."<p>Nabiki said, "It wouldn't do any good, anyway. Ranma<br/>hasn't gotten the idea of 'if only'. Those Chinese<br/>clothes allow for quite a bit of growth and shrinkage."<br/>She got her smirk back, "Not to mention, development."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda followed Kasumi into the kitchen, where they could<br/>talk without interruption. "Okay, Kasumi, why don't I<br/>remember you giving me this "if only", or whatever,<br/>idea?"<p>Kasumi said, "We can talk later. I have to serve supper."<p>He planted himself in front of the doorway, "I've waited<br/>five years. I'm not waiting any longer."<p>Kasumi stopped, "But you said you just found out." But<br/>she sighed, "Oh, alright." Kaneda took the tray with its<br/>bowls of anmitsu gelatin and held it for her. Kasumi<br/>brought her mind around to the topic at hand; she then<br/>said, "You were complaining that your clothes weren't<br/>fitting you right. They were making you uncomfortable.<br/>But you were my brother at the time, and as far as I<br/>could see there was no problem there. You couldn't bring<br/>yourself to admit that the clothes were only ill-fitting<br/>when you were," she reflexively slowed down out of<br/>concern other people would hear, "a girl." Kaneda had<br/>been on of those people. She hadn't wanted to embarrass<br/>him. It had to be his idea to let others know.<p>Kaneda's face reddened. He barely remembered it. But he<br/>was familiar with why he didn't want to mention the girl.<br/>When he was a kid, just about the only time he became a<br/>girl was by accident. Then the most visible change was<br/>the color of his hair. It went from a red that almost no<br/>Japanese he knew had to the color most Japanese had. He<br/>was no longer different from others, but he WAS different<br/>from himself. He was no longer Kaneda Tendou. He was<br/>somebody else, a stranger to everybody he knew. There<br/>were times he liked that. There were other times when he<br/>felt like just a nameless little kid lost in the "sea of<br/>black hair". Invisible.<p>The easiest way to become a somebody again was to find<br/>cold water and become the flame-haired Kaneda. The black-<br/>haired girl, until Wednesday night, had remained nameless,<br/>and lost. She was like a person who hadn't been properly<br/>buried. A ghost. To mention her was to invite bad luck.<br/>It was bad enough she could possess him. His ideas about<br/>the girl had only become more sophisticated with age.<p>Kasumi continued with her account of how Kaneda got<br/>clothes that fit no matter the body, "I said, "If only<br/>you could get proper-fitting clothes from the same place<br/>you got your hammers"."<p>Kaneda had a pang of guilt. Yes, of course he would have<br/>preferred to forget Kasumi had said that. She didn't<br/>approve of him using wooden mallets. But I only use them<br/>when my martial arts skills aren't enough. I AM from the<br/>school of Anything-Goes was his justification. Of course<br/>the mallets had long since disappeared from the ancient<br/>tool chest. Kaneda wasn't sure WHERE they were when he<br/>wasn't using them.<p>Kasumi continued, "I placed a change of clothes that were<br/>a size larger in the old tool chest. I then, uh,<br/>'accidentally', I'm afraid, spilled some hot water on<br/>you. You were so upset at the time you apparently didn't<br/>notice the switch. But it did show you had gotten the<br/>idea."<p>Kaneda said, "So you went ahead and started making<br/>duplicate outfits for me." Suddenly he smiled. "And not<br/>one of them were for a girl."<p>Kasumi retrieved the tray from Kaneda, "That's right. As<br/>far as everybody knew, you were meant to be a guy."<p>She was out the kitchen door before Kaneda snapped back<br/>to the present, "Oh-h, no!" And he went after her,<br/>"Kasumi, just because you now know I was meant to be a<br/>girl, doesn't mean you HAVE to treat me like a girl!"<p>Even before he got into the family room, Dad made it<br/>known he'd heard, "Kaneda! If anybody knows how a how the<br/>different genders should be, it's your sister Kasumi! How<br/>can you suggest that she would treat you as anything but<br/>what you were meant to be!" After 16 years of denial,<br/>only a very quiet voice in him said, as *I* meant you to<br/>be.<p>Kaneda knew that Dad could no longer tolerate anything<br/>related to Akane Saotome. She would have to wait until<br/>supper was over with.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It was after supper, and Ranma STILL hadn't shown up.<br/>Kaneda was beginning to be worried. That was on top of<br/>all the other worries that were piling up on him.<p>Mr. Saotome would rather I was engaged to anybody else<br/>but Ranma. Kuno says he's in love with me. Nabiki is on<br/>any side with money. And Kasumi has decided I should be a<br/>girl after all. He sulked. The only one who WANTS me to<br/>be a guy is Dad. Out loud he said, "Gee, why doesn't<br/>that make me feel better."<p>He found himself outside Nabiki's room. He was tempted to<br/>go straight in; but he knocked. She answered, "Come in,<br/>Kaneda."<p>When he opened the door he found her seated on her desk<br/>chair. It was turned around, facing the bed. She<br/>gestured, "Sit. We'll talk."<p>Kaneda said, "I won't be here that long!" He left the<br/>door open as he strode over to her, "You sold me!"<p>Nabiki, in her faded cutoffs and green halter, casually<br/>crossed her bare legs, "Are you still a free agent? Are<br/>you still able to say "no"? You are not forced or<br/>obligated. Therefore, I did not 'sell' you."<p>In a battle of words, Kaneda knew who had the technique.<br/>"What about family feeling!"<p>Nabiki put a bent elbow over the chair's back, "I'm still<br/>loyal to everybody who's a Tendou...Akane."<p>It took a couple of seconds for him to fit that last<br/>piece of Nabiki's sentence, "Now wait a minute! Just<br/>because you're calling the girl I change into "Akane<br/>Saotome" DOESN'T mean I'm still not ME inside! I'm still<br/>a Tendou!"<p>Nabiki smiled, "Haven't you heard that "Form defines<br/>destiny"? But ignoring anatomy and metabolism, let's talk<br/>of social and legal norms. When a woman gets married, the<br/>threads that tie her to her parental family become<br/>reduced, at best. Her taking a new name indicates that<br/>she now belongs to another family."<p>Kaneda said, "But I'm NOT married! I haven't even left<br/>the house!"<p>Nabiki said, "That is because your fiance is living with<br/>us. And by taking his name, you have shown that you<br/>spiritually do not belong to the Tendou family."<p>Kaneda yelled, "Akane Saotome is just a name you made<br/>up!"<p>Nabiki said with pride, "Ah, but soon it will not be<br/>fiction, but LEGAL. The money I got from Kuno-baby went<br/>to a down payment." Her expression shifted to one of<br/>'altruism', "I didn't even profit on the transaction."<p>That bit of strange news threw Kaneda for a temporary<br/>loss for words.<p>Sounding rehearsed, Nabiki's smiled, "So you see, I have<br/>been thinking of you the whole while. I am clearing the<br/>way so you may be Mrs. Ranma Saotome."<p>Kaneda protested, "I don't want to be the wife! I want<br/>HER to be the Mrs.!"<p>Nabiki uncrossed her legs, "Oh, well, that's something<br/>Kaneda's going to help pay for." She rose up, smiling,<br/>"But since you ARE a Tendou, I can give you a discount."<p>Either way, Kaneda felt slimed. It did not improve his<br/>temper.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>But he could hardly direct his frustration at Oneesan.<br/>"Kasumi, I've been a guy my whole life. I don't want to<br/>be a girl."<p>Kasumi wiped dry one of the dishes she was washing, "And<br/>Ranma feels the same way. And since our guest was born<br/>that way, I would think he has a better right to be the<br/>guy." She put the plate down and turned to Kaneda,<br/>"Unless, of course, you are prepared to give up the idea<br/>of being engaged."<p>Kaneda tried to say something, but couldn't. His mind was<br/>in brain lock.<p>Kasumi wiped her hands on a dry dishtowel, "This has not<br/>been an easy decision on my part, Kane-chan. It's taken<br/>me until today to come to terms with the truth. As I said<br/>this afternoon, everything was simpler before Ranma<br/>came." She tried to give a reassuring grip on his arm, "I<br/>recognize it will be difficult. But just as living in a<br/>guy's body allowed you to be a think like a guy, living<br/>in a girl's will allow you to think like a girl."<p>It was difficult for Kaneda to speak, "Ra, Ranma has a<br/>girl's body. What if, if SHE wants to...be the girl?"<br/>That was the closest his cursed mind could allow that<br/>Ranma might not be a girl.<p>Kasumi's hand fell from his arm, "But Ranma's only been a<br/>girl for..." She looked into Ototou's eyes. Among the<br/>pain, she saw his desperate hope. She bowed her head, "If<br/>it is Ranma's own decision."<p>Kaneda smiled a thank you, and hurried out of the kitchen<br/>before she could qualify her consent.<p>He nearly bumped into Mr. Saotome. "Er, excuse me!"<p>Genma looked up at the boy with veiled disapproval.<p>Outside in the hall, Kaneda slowed down he heard:<br/>"Kasumi, isn't it obvious that you are the only one<br/>FEMALE enough for my son?..."<p>Kaneda thought, But Dr. Tofu loves her!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>A workout in the dojo didn't do much to release Kaneda's<br/>frustrations. Or worries. Ranma still hadn't come home.<br/>"But this isn't Ranma's home, is it?" The hot and sweaty<br/>martial artist said to himself. "Ranma's never had a<br/>home. How can you expect her to want to be a wife, then?<br/>Doesn't one imply the other?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>He went into the bathroom nude with thoughts like this.<br/>"Am I willing to be the wife? Can I really overcome my<br/>life as a guy for her?" It still seemed bizarre to him<br/>that he'd have to be a girl to marry the girl he wanted.<br/>For that is how he honestly thought of Ranma.<p>When he finished his cold water washing, he got up from<br/>the low plastic stool and was about to leave. He stopped<br/>to look at the hot water in the furo.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Outside in the laundry room, the naked blackhaired girl<br/>threw her towel into the laundry basket. On the washer<br/>she saw a pair of yellow pajamas with swirling suns and<br/>black catheads. On them was pinned a note, [For Akane; I<br/>bought this a month ago on a whim. Love, Kasumi.]<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Akane tested the pajamas again, tugging on the tops and<br/>bottoms. "I wouldn't have picked this pattern, but it IS<br/>almost something I could wear as a guy." It wasn't as<br/>soft as she thought girls would wear. Or is it just that<br/>this body is soft? She knew her awareness increased as a<br/>girl.<p>Still, she knew they were meant for girls. That knowledge<br/>made her feel a little uneasy when she went out of the<br/>laundry room. At least I'm wearing pants.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It was dark in the back hall. But this was the house she<br/>grew up in. She knew how to find her way around even with<br/>her eyes-<p>Suddenly the door of the room next to the bathroom<br/>opened. It was the master bedroom: Oh, no! Dad's<br/>going to see me as a girl!<p>Ranma-chan's voice said, "What's the matter, Kane-chan?"<p>Akane was relieved. "Ranma! You came back!"<p>Ranma-chan said, " ' course I came back. This IS our<br/>home, after all?"<p>Akane's heart beneath her breast felt like leaping. "OUR<br/>home?"<p>The shadow reached out, and took his hand, "Come to bed.<br/>We got the place all to ourselves."<p>Akane dared to hope, "We do?"<p>Pulling her inside, Ranma-chan said, "Mm-hm! It's a<br/>present from the families."<p>Akane couldn't believe it, "You, you want to... in Dad's<br/>room?"<p>Ranma-chan slid the door closed, "We ARE gonna inherit<br/>everything. Livin' in the master bedroom is part of the<br/>deal Pop worked out."<p>Akane wanted to protest. Dad hadn't even died yet. To do<br/>anything in his room was like-<p>Ranma-chan giggled, "Nabiki even sold me her long purple<br/>negligee and matchin', lacey lingerie."<p>Akane had never seen Nabiki actually wearing it, but she<br/>HAD teased him enough with it to did know which one<br/>Ranma was talking about: "Do, do you have a tissue? I<br/>think I'm going to have a nose bleed."<p>Ranma laughed, "That's my line," and turned on the light.<p>Ranma-kun was wearing nothing but his undershirt and<br/>boxers.<p>Akane cried, "But I thought!" She looked down and saw<br/>SHE was the one wearing the purple negligee and<br/>lingerie!<p>Ranma-kun leered at her, "Now it's time for the<br/>honeymoon." The blackhaired guy advanced on her.<p>The muscular teen exuded male hormones. Even on his best<br/>days, Kaneda could not match this Ranma for sheer<br/>virility. Akane for the first time in her life felt weak<br/>and vulnerable, fragile, frail.<p>Ranma-kun lifted her up in his steely arms. "Now that<br/>we've settled who's the man and who's the woman, we can<br/>get down to the reason there is men and women."<p>Ranma-kun had no problem taking her over to the futon and<br/>lowering down onto it. His face was close enough to kiss<br/>her lips. "Nabiki sold me her copy of the "Kama Sutra".<p>Akane cried, "Try THIS position!" And kicked him in his<br/>nuts!<p>As Ranma-kun fell, Akane gripped him by his shoulders and<br/>pushed him down as she rose up. She spun him until she<br/>was on top. She then sprang off his gut and leaped for the<br/>way out. "I've got to get wet! That guy would never want<br/>to do anything with a guy!"<p>Out of Dad's room it was raining.<p>Pitter, patter, pitter, patter...<p>The redhead Kaneda-kun was wearing the purple negligee<br/>and matching, lacey lingerie!<p>In a field strewn with flowers, Kuno in his kendo-gi was<br/>waiting holding a bouquet of red roses. "Saotome, I love<br/>you. I would date with you!"<p>Kaneda-kun told him, "You've have to be kidding! I'm a<br/>guy!"<p>Suddenly Kaneda-kun fell through the flowers, "YE-OWW!"<p>He fell into the same outdoor pool that he fell in on<br/>Ranma's first day of school.<p>Kaneda was in the uniform navy blue one-piece bathing<br/>suit that Japanese schoolgirls were known for.<p>Water was everywhere! Kaneda-kun was drowning! He<br/>reached out with his arms and kicked out with his legs,<br/>trying to scream for help under water!<p>The only people in the pool were four naked Kunos. Rather<br/>than save her they took each other's hands and circled<br/>her on her way towards the bottom. All the while they<br/>chanted, "I love you. I would date with you. I love you.<br/>I would date with you..."<p>The panda was there, throwing streamers and confetti<br/>while blowing a noisemaker.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Finally Kane-chan's scream found air: "NNOO!"<p>She was awake. She was sitting up in her bed in the<br/>yellow pajamas, panting heavily. She stared blankly at<br/>morning light coming through her bedroom window, t<br/>rying to get rid of the feeling that nightmares left.<p>Her first waking thought was a memory. It was the memory<br/>of yesterday's sunset. Walking away, Kuno paused long<br/>enough to look over his shoulder. "I love you."<p>A cold quiver of revulsion shook her more than the<br/>nightmare had.<p>In her mind she heard Ranma-chan call her a, "Pervert!"<p>Kaneda brought his hand from his fevered head. "Geez, I'm<br/>soaked with sweat!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Going into the laundry room, Kane-chan heard Mr. Saotome<br/>humming in the bathroom. She scowled. Disgusted, she was<br/>tempted to leave.<p>Instead she went to the utility sink and turned on the<br/>cold water. She splashed her face.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>After taking off his school boys' uniform, the nude<br/>redhead entered the bathroom with a short towel in front<br/>of him. Mr. Saotome was stripped and sitting on the pre-<br/>bath stool. Look at him! Why does HE need so much<br/>lather. He's bald! But he wasn't there to test his<br/>martial arts skills against Ranma's sensei. "Mr. Saotome,<br/>did Ranma come home?"<p>Mr. Saotome ignored him.<p>Coming up behind him, Kaneda spoke louder, "Mr. Saotome,<br/>I asked if Ranma was back!"<p>Mr. Saotome finally said, "Oh, it's you. I have soap in<br/>my ears. You'll have to speak louder."<p>Stifling his frustration, Kaneda repeated his question.<p>Mr. Saotome confidently said, "No, Ranma didn't come back<br/>last night. But he will. I am the only constant in his<br/>life. He always comes back to me."<p>Kaneda's anger increased. Poor Ranma. She's never had a<br/>chance to know what having friends and family is like.<p>Mr. Saotome paused from his morning toilet to smile,<br/>"Yes, that's why Ranma has no choice but to honor an<br/>agreement made by his old man and sensei."<p>*P-thard*<p>Kaneda dropped the wooden mallet as he walked out. He<br/>left Mr. Saotome on the tile floor.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda didn't hurry to school. He thought about skipping.<br/>"I already skipped two days in a row, now. And today is<br/>Saturday. There's only a half-day of school."<p>Then he saw her! Like a mirage, Ranma-chan was walking<br/>the fence of the bridge over the canal. Kaneda ran to<br/>meet her as she came in his direction. He was almost<br/>afraid to find out it was an illusion, "Ranma? Ranma,<br/>you didn't leave!"<p>Ranma pulled herself out of her thoughts; she looked up<br/>at him. She was still frowning. "Oh, it's you."<p>Kaneda slowed down, "...And you're still a girl!"<p>Ranma-chan stopped on top of the rail to let him know,<br/>"It ain't MY idea! Every time I found some hot water, I<br/>got wet with cold again!"<p>Kaneda was going to ask about the "Saotome Hot Water<br/>Attack" but decided not to. Ranma probably couldn't make<br/>it work on herself for the same reason that snow didn't<br/>change him when he was a girl.<p>Kaneda grinned, "See? It's easier just to remain like we<br/>are now. Let's go to school."<p>Ranma-chan strode past him; her body language made it<br/>clear she wasn't to be stopped, "Look! I may not have<br/>much of a choice about havin' a girl's body, but I do<br/>have one about BEIN' a girl!"<p>She ignored Kaneda as he watched her walk away.<p>Kaneda was still smiling when he turned back for school.<br/>"Yes, Ranma, you will at long last have a family and<br/>home." And his leap matched the one his heart felt, "You<br/>will have your new life...Mrs. Ranma TENDOU!"<p>The End of this chapter<p>[I've made minor changes in Chapter 05. The important one<br/>is that Kaneda has decided the best way to keep Ranma off<br/>balance is to say the same kind of things to her that<br/>Ranma said to the original Akane.]
