</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>13: Tomobiki the 13th<p>In the six-day Buddhist week Tomobiki can be a very bad<br/>luck day. The only thing that could have made THIS day<br/>any unluckier was if it were FRIDAY the 13th on the<br/>International calendar.<p>Morning, Monday the 13th. Ranma-kun's only alarm clock<br/>was internal. It was set to get him up before dawn to<br/>begin the day with a round of sparring with his old man.<p>Waking was the time to remember dreams:<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Sunday evening. Ranma-chan slowly came to. It took a<br/>while for her to be aware what was happening. Ranma had a<br/>keenly trained sense of body, but it seemed dull when he<br/>was a girl. Pop told him it was all in his head. Change<br/>the gender of the pronouns, and that was something the<br/>Old Man COULD be right about. If a martial artist didn't<br/>live or die by their body-a point Pop had made sure she<br/>got by constantly challenging her to a fight at every<br/>turn on their long trip back from China-Ranma would've<br/>put even more distance between him and it than she had.<p>It felt like her legs and arms were wrapped around<br/>something. She was reminded of the time she had spent the<br/>night up a power pole in one of Pop's stupid training<br/>exercises.<p>-Cats! The word clawed at her throat. Had the stupid<br/>Old Man had sprinkled fish oil all around a greased pole<br/>again!<p>Ranma-chan tried to get awake and get away: "Aaar!" But<br/>found that the pole was soft and warm. And the rungs were<br/>hands under her thighs.<p>-But her hands were tied! And she was wearing a corset!<br/>Why hadn't she felt any sense of danger!<p>Kane-chan said, "Don't SQUEEZE me like that! If you want<br/>me to put you down, I will!"<p>Ranma-chan, aware at last, saw that Kane-chan was giving<br/>her a piggyback ride. Kane-chan's hands and hips were<br/>supporting her thighs. Kane-chan had used Ranma-chan's<br/>own belt to keep her hands around upper chest. She also<br/>saw that they were headed back towards the Tendou house.<br/>The streetlights were on, but it didn't look too much<br/>later than...<p>Ranma-chan asked, "Wha, what happened? How'd I get here?"<p>Kane-chan said, "You tell me. My back was turned when you<br/>attacked Dr. Tofu."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "That's right!" as she sat up straight.<br/>Kane-chan let her get off of her.<p>Ranma-chan immediately fell on her butt. "My muscles are<br/>TOO relaxed! They won't give me any support!"<p>Turning around, Kane-chan put her hands on her hips and<br/>sighed, "I guess I WILL have to carry you the rest of the<br/>way." The girl who wanted Ranma to be her girlfriend<br/>didn't seem too happy about the idea.<p>Ranma-chan asked herself, "What did that acupressurist DO<br/>to me! How can I prepare against him, if-" Suddenly<br/>she had a flash of memory. The smiling man in the glasses<br/>had told her to relax; he meant her no harm. Ranma-chan<br/>wondered, "A hypnotic shiatsu technique?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It was Monday, a school day. Ranma-kun got off of his<br/>futon/mattress wondering if he was still under a post-<br/>hypnotic spell. He didn't really resent the man who'd put<br/>the corset back on him. "Since he can take it off of me,<br/>again, I guess I gotta play his game...for now."<p>After doing a few stretching exercises, Ranma-kun stopped<br/>to pull up his undershirt. The invisible corset gave even<br/>his male body a definite hourglass figure. And the<br/>exercises only reminded him more that it was there.<p>Behind and below, his pop asked, "What happened to you,<br/>boy!"<p>Snarling, Ranma-kun spun around and attacked the man<br/>still in bed. It felt GOOD not to be relaxed.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>They had carried their fight into the Tendou garden. For<br/>once, Pop kept his mouth shut. He wasn't interested in<br/>creating a battle simulation today. Practice was<br/>different from battle simulation. Practice was to get the<br/>get the body to do what it was SUPPOSED to do, time after<br/>time. It was not the time for emotions. Emotions were for<br/>when you wanted to put serious power into your battle<br/>aura. Even when Ranma was his most pissed off at his Old<br/>Man, he couldn't put all that much into it. Pop had<br/>conditioned Ranma to limit the amount he could use<br/>against him. Practicing also tamped down his emotions.<br/>Sparring with the Old Man was such a familiar routine<br/>when in his own body Ranma-kun's feelings actually eased.<p>...Or maybe it WAS the post-hypnotic spell.<p>The eldest daughter came to the open doors of the garden<br/>hall, "Mr. Saotome! Ranma! Breakfast!"<p>Mr. Saotome stopped to called back, "Thank you, Kasumi!<br/>It smells delici-"<p>They had forgotten they were in mid-air. They had been<br/>using each other to stay aloft.<p>Splash! They landed in the koi pond.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>While the panda was on all fours shaking the water from<br/>its fur, Ranma-chan took off her pants. She squeezed the<br/>pond water from them as best she could. She kept her<br/>underpants on, and squeezed them where they were loose.<br/>She was glad her body sense was dull. She didn't want to<br/>feel the curves and extra-padding. Her well-trained mind<br/>used the technique she used to fight-while-injured to put<br/>even more awareness between her and the body. She<br/>wouldn't give herself a chance to feel effeminate. And<br/>she didn't. But it also left herself more open to her<br/>subconscious. And her subconscious equated this girl-body<br/>with what it knew of girl bodies. In the irony of the<br/>human psychology, by denying her girl half, Ranma had<br/>more of a feminine manner than when she had fought<br/>against it.<p>She put her pants back on, and started taking her shirt<br/>off.<p>While the panda went to sit at the family table, Ranma<br/>sat down cross-legged in the garden hall. She took off<br/>her undershirt and squeezed its water onto the grass.<br/>There was something about a wet shirt...<p>That was when Nabiki Tendou came into the family room<br/>behind Ranma-chan, "You needn't bother putting that back<br/>on. I brought you your school uniform."<p>When the panda saw the sky blue jumper and white blouse,<br/>it spewed out the tea it was drinking.<p>Ranma-chan remained where she was sitting, unaware of<br/>which uniform was being offered; "I'm not wearin' any<br/>uniform. I have to wear Chinese clothes."<p>Nabiki said, "Why? Did you take some," she indulged<br/>herself in a little melodrama: " "vow to remain in<br/>Chinese clothes as long as you have a Chinese curse"?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Something like that."<p>Mr. Tendou came down the hall from his room. He was still<br/>brushing his teeth, " ' Morning, Ranma. Morning workout,<br/>hunh?"<p>Ranma-chan smiled up at him, "Good morning, Mr. Tendou!"<p>Kaneda, in his school uniform, said, "Good morning,<br/>Ranma!"<p>Ranma-chan twisted herself around to say, "Good morning,<br/>Kane-" Why was she grinning nice and sweetly at him!<p>Nabiki looked at the effect Ranma-chan's size Ds were<br/>having on the two menfolk. They stood there like statues,<br/>just staring. She got in the space between the two guys,<br/>"Ranma, you have GOT to learn feminine modesty." She then<br/>draped the Furinkan girls' uniform over Ranma's front.<p>Kaneda cried, "Oh-oh!... Did you HAVE to, Nabiki?"<p>It took a moment for it to register on Ranma what was<br/>being used to cover her. "A DRESS!" It was almost a<br/>dress. Kasume had carefully and artfully used safety pins<br/>had been used to attach the blouse to the jumper. They<br/>were hidden out of sight.<p>Nabiki corrected her, "A uniform. Your uniform."<p>Ranma-chan snatched off of her, and in one motion had<br/>pivoted around onto one knee. She THREW it at the smart<br/>aleck, "That's NOT funny!"<p>Nabiki caught it. Smiling smugly she said, "This is no<br/>joke. As far as the school is concerned, YOU'RE a girl."<p>Ranma-chan told her, "I don't CARE what others think!"<p>Nabiki was still smiling as she placed the dress over her<br/>arm, "Oh, you don't, do you?" She turned for the family<br/>room, "Kaneda, it is up to you to say the right thing at<br/>the right time." Then she said cryptically, "It will be<br/>up to others to see that the right thing to occurs."<p>Kaneda said, "Hunh?" He was a little distracted by the<br/>sight of Ranma-chan's again bare boobs.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>At breakfast, Kaneda was still distracted THINKING about<br/>Ranma-chan's naked boobs.<p>Ranma-kun was fully dressed in his red shirt and blue<br/>pants now. He poured his bowl of miso over his bowl of<br/>rice. He looked at the guy sitting next to him, "If<br/>you're gonna stare into space like that, I guess you<br/>won't mind me havin' that dumpling?" Ranma was<br/>determined to be ignorant; it helped that he was not a<br/>girl then.<p>Kaneda looked over at Ranma...and saw a guy's chest. He<br/>frowned, "No! I wanted that!" Girls traditionally were<br/>supposed to defer to males; it helped that he was not a<br/>girl then.<p>Ranma-kun quirked a smile, "Ha! Too bad!" as she picked<br/>up her chopsticks.<p>Kaneda picked up the dish.<p>Ranma-kun cried, "Hey!"<p>Kaneda brought it around to the side away from the guy<br/>that should be a girl, "Ha! You have to learn to think<br/>about somebody besides yourself!"<p>Ranma-kun told her, "HA! That's a good one! You're one to<br/>talk..."<p>While they fought, the panda reached over with its<br/>chopsticks and plucked the dumpling away for itself.<p>Drinking from the bowl, Nabiki said to Kasumi, "The<br/>soup's a little bland today, don't you think?"<p>Doing likewise, Kasumi said, "Do you think so?" She then<br/>noticed on the other side of her, "Father, isn't it time<br/>you took that toothbrush out?" Except that her father's<br/>stare wasn't blank, it was as if he was in one of his<br/>trances again. "I wonder if I pour a glass of water on<br/>Father, he'll return to us?" Ranma wasn't the only one<br/>who preferred ignore the obvious.<p>"Oh, that's right!" Kasumi now talked across the table,<br/>"Kaneda? Do me a favor and drop by Doctor Tofu's clinic<br/>on your way home from school."<p>Ranma-kun almost choked when he heard the Tofu's name.<p>Kaneda stopped eating, too, as he seriously studied<br/>Ranma's reactions.<p>Kasume explained, "I borrowed this book." She picked it<br/>from beside her cushion. "Will you return it to Doctor<br/>Tofu for me?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Sure, why don'tcha do it?"<p>Kaneda looked at him intently, "Why? What do you have<br/>planned?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Me? I got nothing planned."<p>Kaneda said, "Right, "plan" gives you too much credit."<br/>Still keeping his eye on him, he said, "I'm sorry,<br/>Kasume. I can't today."<p>Kasume put the book back, "Oh? I guess I'll have to go<br/>myself."<p>Ranma-kun said, "Why don't you go, "Shin-pi-ko"?"<br/>taunting him with Tofu's alias for her.<p>Kaneda yanked on his pigtail as he got up from the table,<br/>"C'mon! We're going to be late!"<p>Ranma-kun yelled, "Hey! Get your hands off of me! And I<br/>haven't finished eatin' yet!"<p>Kaneda growled, "Grrr!" He knew Ranma would only be MORE<br/>stubborn with a guy.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan returned from the kitchen, "Ranma! What do you<br/>say we BOTH go to school dressed alike!" She couldn't<br/>bring herself to giggle.<p>Ranma-kun saw the crazy girl in her Furinkan blue jumper<br/>holding out with one hand the one Nabiki had tried to get<br/>Ranma to wear. The other hand held a squeeze water<br/>bottle! Ranma-kun cried, "Aaa! Stay away from me!"<p>Kane-chan stalked him, "You're not afraid of some<br/>ordinary pieces of cotton, are you?" She made the hem<br/>move back-and-forth, "Look how modest it is. It's not<br/>like it's a mini, or anything revealing."<p>Ranma scrambled away from the table. "I'm a guy! You<br/>can't make me wear a dress!"<p>Kane-chan's squirt of water was her answer to Ranma being<br/>a guy or not. She then smiled wickedly at him, "If I pin<br/>and unpin your arms with my "Clinging-to-a-Statue", I<br/>wonder how if I CAN make you-"<p>Ranma-kun told her, "I'm not gonna give you the chance to<br/>find out!" and was off for the front door, followed by<br/>Kane-chan.<p>Nabiki told Kasume, "They've finally left. Now *I* can go<br/>and change."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma's pride wouldn't let him look TOO scared by a girl.<br/>He stayed close enough to give her a chase. He laughed,<br/>"I'm gonna go to school as a GUY today!"<p>Kane-chan had the dress over an arm, and held out the<br/>squeeze bottle out in front of her, "And how are you<br/>going to do THAT! Ranma Saotome is registered as a girl!<br/>And KEI Tendou isn't registered at all!"<p>Ranma-kun forced himself to sound light, "Maybe TODAY is<br/>the day I'll let people know Ranma Saotome IS a man!"<p>Kane-chan was just close enough to squeeze the bottle,<br/>"You think you're MAN enough to tell everybody you're a<br/>GIRL!" The wind blew the squirt back onto Kaneda.<p>Ranma-kun looked over his shoulder and gloated at the guy<br/>in the boys' uniform, "Just 'cause YOU'RE not, doesn't<br/>mean I-"<p>Splash! The old woman with the ladle got Ranma.<p>Kaneda picked up his speed to catch Ranma-chan before<br/>she'd had a chance to recover. When her wrist was within<br/>reach, "You see! Mrs. Tanaka's praying to the water<br/>gods, and THEY want you to be a girl!"<p>He just missed grabbing flesh and bone. Stepping out of<br/>his reach, Ranma-chan confronted him, "And they're all<br/>WET! Let them stick to makin' mold! What do THEY know<br/>about girls!"<p>Kaneda said, "I guess you don't know about bloating,<br/>yet!" Stupid! Like THAT'S going to have her want to be a<br/>girl!<p>Kaneda knew he had to time this just right he probably<br/>wouldn't get another shot at it. "Look! I wear a dress<br/>when I'M a girl. You're just a coward!"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "A coward!" She stepped forward to<br/>challenge him using that name.<p>Taking the hem with his hands a meter apart, Kaneda<br/>flipped jumper up. Expecting a standard attack, Ranma-<br/>chan saw too late the blue jumper's skirt bell over her<br/>like a bag. Kaneda then yanked it down, trapping Ranma-<br/>chan's arms inside the jumper's waist and pinned blouse<br/>itself. "I TOLD you the Tendou School used tools!"<p>Grabbing onto the outside of the skirt, Kaneda yelled,<br/>"Here's your chance to prove how good the Saotome School<br/>is-" He ran, pulling Ranma-chan by the skirt, "-at<br/>footwork!"<p>DESPITE the extra training the Saotomes gave to lower<br/>body control and improvisation, Ranma-chan was forced<br/>again to deal with short legs. Even though her head was<br/>completely covered up, the guy with the longer legs<br/>didn't let up his speed. Ranma-chan had to take large,<br/>bounding steps; on just about every other one she thought<br/>she would trip or twist her ankle, maybe even break a<br/>leg. But her opponent gave her no mercy: On he made her<br/>run! He knew better than to give her the chance to<br/>recover!<p>Ranma's yells were muffled, "No good cheater! Whoever<br/>heard of martial arts DRESS-fittin'! Let me out! Let go<br/>of me! Just give me a chance to kick your butt! I'll<br/>alter YOU to fit into it!..."<p>Swearing all the way, Ranma-chan tried to bust the<br/>clothes at the seams. But Kaneda had thought of how to<br/>deal with that, too: He pulled and swung her this way and<br/>that in an erratic pattern. It took most of Ranma-chan's<br/>concentration just to stay on her feet. Whenever she<br/>thought she had enough balance to use her strength to<br/>break free, she lost it on a zig that should have been a<br/>zag! The distraction of the stupid invisible corset didn't<br/>help! The best she could do was use the pressure Kaneda<br/>exerted holding onto the jumper to work her head up<br/>towards the neck hole of the blouse.<p>The first sight Ranma-chan saw was their going through<br/>the school's main gate! "Oh, no! I'm not goin' to school<br/>like this!" Now that she could see, she COULD use a<br/>Saotome technique: She dug in her heels.<p>But Kaneda had momentum and weight on HIS side: He swung<br/>her around until her back was up against a school wall.<p>AS they BOTH gathered their breaths, martial arts style,<br/>Kaneda told her, "You're right! You can't go to school in<br/>pants!" It did look stupid to wear baggy pants under a<br/>skirt, even if it was a midi.<p>Ranma-chan told him, "You keep your hands off of my<br/>pants!" She kicked out at him. He stayed just out of the<br/>reach of her slippers. The straps of the jumper fell off<br/>her shoulders.<p>Kaneda then lunged, and used the skirt itself to help pin<br/>Ranma-chan's legs.<p>Meanwhile Ranma-chan had moved her hands up past the<br/>jumper's waist and INTO the blouse. Her arms up against<br/>it and her red shirted boobs, she started unbuttoning<br/>from the inside. "There's NO way I'm gonna wear this!"<p>Kaneda, to keep the skirt tight against the wall,<br/>replaced his hands with his knees, pressing his lower<br/>body against her. He then started unbuttoning Ranma-<br/>chan's red Chinese shirt she was revealing under the<br/>blouse. "You WILL, if you have nothing ELSE to wear!"<p>At the sight of Ranma's large, exposed breasts, Kaneda<br/>got a nosebleed! This on top of what had happened this<br/>morning had caused too much pressure to build up.<p>Realizing what he'd done, Kaneda tilted his head back as<br/>he reached for a handkerchief. "I'm sorry!" he told<br/>Ranma-chan, turning away.<p>That was when Kaneda saw the horde of athlete-types all<br/>suited up to attack him again.<p>But there weren't attacking. They were staring.<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "Back off, you jerks! What are you<br/>lookin' at!" She responded like a guy, still not making<br/>the connection that it wasn't HIS bare chest they were<br/>seeing.<p>Kaneda raised his hands, challenging, "OK, who's<br/>first!"<p>Tears started flowing down their faces. Most of them<br/>could be HEARD moaning and sobbing. A wrestler in<br/>particular clenched a fist and raised his lower lip as<br/>high as he could, "What a time to not even TRY to win<br/>what is Kaneda's!"<p>The rugby player said, "We have accepted our defeat."<p>A dancer told them, "We had a meeting, and we've decided<br/>to choke back our pride and recognize you as the<br/>school's-"<p>A Greco-Roman wrestler added, "-the TOWN'S best<br/>athlete!"<p>A boxer said, "Oh! What about KEI Tendou?"<p>A baseball catcher bawled, "We can't defeat you, Kaneda,<br/>let alone somebody from out of town!" And hid his face in<br/>the crook of his arm.<p>They all lowered their heads into their hands and wept<br/>loud and deeply as they lost face.<p>Ranma-chan asked, "Talk about pathetic." Used to<br/>competing for real, she had little sympathy for those<br/>raised on the Japanese mythos in sports mangas and anime,<br/>and what they were going through.<p>Kaneda turned around to tell Ranma-chan sports WAS like<br/>being a warrior- When he was reminded of her large,<br/>naked breasts again!<p>Squeezing his nose, Kaneda told her, "Get back into you<br/>uniform! You don't want OTHERS to see you like that!" He<br/>was suddenly possessive.<p>Ranma-chan looked past her bare boobs, and said, "No<br/>absolutely way do I want that!" She brought her arms out<br/>of the blouse and lifted the skirt over her head. In<br/>practically one motion she had shed the girls' uniform.<p>Kaneda picked up the uniform and shook it at her; "I'm<br/>going to see you in this, yet!"<p>A sumo wrestler heard this, "What kind of guy would<br/>rather see that than naked chichis?"<p>While Ranma-chan buttoned her Chinese shirt, Kaneda,<br/>directed his scowl at his rivals, "Okay, you all give up.<br/>What brought this on all of a sudden, hunh! SO Kei<br/>Tendou beat you! I've done that, too."<p>A voice full of samurai superiority informed him,<br/>"Because, KANEDA Tendou, this is BEYOND their petty<br/>concerns: A base, falsehood claims that, rascally knave,<br/>Kei Tendou, has bested ME in combat." Even Kaneda was<br/>startled to see the President of the kendo club wrapped<br/>from head to toe. Only his hair and an opening for his<br/>eyes remained unbandaged.<br/>"Lord Kuno will NEVER admit defeat!" The statement was<br/>also a determined vow.<p>He stifled a sob, and dropped to his knees, propped up<br/>only by his wooden sword.<p>One of the kendo club members said, "Kuno was Furinkan<br/>High's greatest champion."<p>Another member said, "He was also its greatest pervert."<p>Kuno lifted his head, "Who are you calling a pervert!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "That's because they don't know what a<br/>real pervert is," looking at Kaneda.<p>The dancer said, "I agree. Kuno DID try to warn us about<br/>Kaneda."<p>The sumo wrestler said, "Kaneda's more interested in<br/>dresses than naked chichis."<p>Ranma-chan said, "You got that right."<p>Kaneda tossed the uniform away and snapped into the<br/>stance, challenging the jocks. But his "HEY!" was<br/>directed over his shoulder at Ranma-chan.<p>A rugby player said, "Don't get us wrong, Kaneda. You're<br/>an okay enough guy, I guess. You leave us alone when<br/>we're not picking on you."<p>A tackle asked, "But please leave our girlfriends alone."<p>The boxer said, "And pass the message along to your<br/>cousin, Kei, too! We don't want to have to fight him<br/>again."<p>Kuno picked up his sacred vow again, "I shall NEVER admit<br/>defeat! Whether that cretinous Kei Tendou kicks me one<br/>hundred times or two hundred times, it matters not to<br/>Tatewaki Kuno." And he pulled the bandages away from his<br/>face.<p>Nasty black-and-blue footprints went across the skin<br/>around his mouth and eyes.<p>The Horde of Jocks exclaimed, "Oh-whoa-oh!..."<p>Ranma-chan ran over to confront the stuck-up jerk, "What<br/>are you callin' cretinous! Admit it: I beat you fair<br/>and square!" She thought the bandages were just some<br/>stupid mind game the idiot was playing.<p>Kaneda came up to warn her, "Hey, wait a minute!"<p>Kuno rose to his feet and walked over to Ranma-chan with<br/>as much dignity as his condition allowed, "Pigtailed<br/>goddess, it is no other."<p>When his hand clasped hers, Ranma-chan cried, "Hey, you<br/>creep!"<p>Kaneda cried, "Oh, boy!"<p>Kuno stared into Ranma-chan's big, blue eyes; "That<br/>honeyed voice."<p>Ranma-chan told him, "Don't forget Akane! SHE showed you<br/>her boobs on purpose!"<p>Kaneda HAD to step in, "Kuno! Leave Ranma alone! She's<br/>MINE!"<p>One of the jocks behind them said, "It's about time<br/>Kaneda acted like a fiance."<p>Ranma-chan told Kaneda, "YOU stay outa this!"<p>Somebody in the crowd said, "Did you hear that?"<p>He was answered with, "I guess she KNOWS how big of a<br/>pervert Kaneda is."<p>A third said, "Well: Da! He stripped her in front of us!"<p>Kaneda screamed, "I did NOT strip her!"<p>A kendo club member asked, "A lady's honor is at stake.<br/>Are you sure we're going to stay out of this?"<p>Kuno cried, "You vile defiler of women! You shall be the<br/>first Tendou to fall!"<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "Hey: This is MY fight!" And she<br/>kicked Kuno across the, until now, unbruised nose.<p>Kuno landed meters away on his back. He lay still and<br/>unconscious.<p>The dancer said, "Defending a lady's honor isn't what it<br/>used to be."<p>A football play asked a question that seemed self-<br/>evident, "Are we men going to stay OUT of it!"<p>There was a near universal, "Unh, hunh!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda went to get Ranma's schoolgirl uniform.<p>But Ranma-chan gave him a good-bye wave, "I'm off to<br/>change!" She jumped on top of the heads of the jocks and<br/>took off on them.<p>A boxer asked, "Oh, she IS going to wear something else?"<p>The dancer said, "If YOU were a girl, would you trust<br/>anything a Tendou wanted you in?" Kaneda's reputation had<br/>started to shift from a loser pervert to possibly being<br/>winner pervert. Jealousy was mixed in with disgust. What<br/>could tip it the other way?<p>Blushing, Kaneda hid the dress behind his back as he<br/>waded into the crowd looking to follow Ranma-chan.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Entering Furinkan's main building, Kaneda held his water<br/>bottle out as if were a lone soldier searching for his<br/>target. He muttered to himself, "I better get to Ranma<br/>quick."<p>The lobby was much more crowded than usual; and people<br/>were coming down the stairs, not up. "But everybody's<br/>supposed to be going UP to their classes." There was also<br/>something odd about a scattered number of them, but<br/>Kaneda was too confused to put his finger on it right<br/>away.<p>Nabiki was waiting for him. She took his elbow, and<br/>directed him to, "Follow the flow, for once, little<br/>brother. We have assembly today."<p>Kaneda looked at her, "Assembly? At Furinkan? Other<br/>schools might have Monday Morning Assemblies, but-" Then<br/>he noticed WHAT his sister was wearing: "Why are you<br/>dressed like that?"<p>Nabiki pulled at her blue slacks and gold shirt (with a<br/>red necktie, no less) as if she were modeling them, "What<br/>do you think of the new dress code? I've called in a few<br/>favors, and passed the word among the girls." Kaneda<br/>looked back at the students headed for the Assembly Hall.<br/>That was what was different. There weren't many, but<br/>there WERE some girls, even boyfriends, in the kind of<br/>clothes they wore away from school, dresses, blouses,<br/>skirts, pants, and shirts. A few even wore noticeable<br/>makeup.<p>Nabiki said, pleased with herself, "A new day has come to<br/>Furinkan. It cost enough, but-" She looked away from him<br/>as she noticed, "Ah! Here come your friends."<p>Kaneda saw that Hiroshi and Daisuke were coming down the<br/>stairs. And they saw Nabiki, and him, "Hello!" Hiroshi<br/>smiled at Nabiki, "That's a nice outfit."<p>Daisuke agreed, "It shows off your figure better than the<br/>school's uniform, at least."<p>Nabiki smiled back as if she were flattered, "How sweet."<p>Kaneda said, "Hello, Hiroshi, Daisuke."<p>It was then Hiroshi really noticed him...and the girls'<br/>dress he was carrying, "Is that uniform for your sister?<br/>Something happen to her other one?"<p>Daisuke asked, disappointed with the obvious, "Is that<br/>the ONLY reason she's in her civies?"<p>Kaneda told them, "No, this is Ranma's uniform."<p>Hiroshi asked, "She's running around without her<br/>uniform!"<p>Daisuke frowned, "Only in our fantasies."<p>Nabiki waved, "Ciao! I'm off to spread the word about the<br/>new dress code!"<p>Before she disappeared into the crowd, Kaneda called out,<br/>"What's happening? What did you do, Nabiki!"<p>She told him, "I followed the Yellow Brick Road, and saw<br/>the Wizard of Ozu!" And just as he lost sight of her, she<br/>added, "A ninja computer wizard!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>As Kaneda and his friends headed towards the Assembly<br/>Hall with the rest of the jostling crowd, he asked, "What<br/>do you know about what's going on?"<p>Daisuke said, "Your sister is responsible, and she didn't<br/>tell you anything? Close family."<p>Hiroshi said, "Give Kaneda a break; you know what his<br/>sister's like. It keeps him from being charged with<br/>anything." Then he said to the little brother, "Rumor has<br/>it that they did a computer search, and brought somebody<br/>in to replace Mr. Touno. He was out of here as soon as he<br/>got the forms."<p>Kaneda had to ask, "Who's Mr. Touno?"<p>Hiroshi told him, "Touno was the acting headmaster for<br/>Furinkan!"<p>Daisuke said, "It's no wonder you didn't know who he was.<br/>He kept to himself."<p>Hiroshi said, "Yeah! They say he took the samurai Spartan<br/>thing mucho seriously."<p>Daisuke nodded, "He would ALWAYS walk around without<br/>shoes, even in winter. He would hit a rock with his sword<br/>over and over in the same spot until he broke it. He<br/>would stand under EVERY waterfall he came to for<br/>hours..."<p>Hiroshi agreed, "A real masochist."<p>Kaneda said, "It sounds like we were lucky he didn't make<br/>US do those kinds of things."<p>Daisuke said, "Then he'd have been a sadist, as well."<p>Hiroshi said in lowered voice, looking around, "They SAY<br/>Touno's the reason there are so many jocks running loose<br/>around here. He wanted Furinkan to turn out warriors."<p>Daisuke said, "And he looked for ways to ACT like<br/>warriors."<p>Kaneda stopped, "Are, are you saying THAT'S why I've been<br/>in all those fights! Thanks for telling me, now!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>When they got to Assembly Hall, they found that the seats<br/>in the back had been taken. If they were to remain<br/>together, they would have to sit near the front.<p>Meanwhile, Kaneda was looking around for Ranma, either<br/>one.<p>Sitting second row, the furthest from the center aisle,<br/>Hiroshi was listening to the conversations around them.<br/>Hiroshi said, "Did you hear that? The teachers don't like<br/>getting a new acting headmaster. They're afraid the REAL<br/>headmaster will find out and come back!"<p>Daisuke said, "Where has he been? Nobody seems to know<br/>who the real headmaster is? And what is FURINKAN, his<br/>little fiefdom?"<p>Kaneda asked, "Do you see Ranma?" With that red shirt, he<br/>would've thought Ranma would be easy to spot, girl or<br/>guy.<p>Hiroshi said, "That headmaster must be one really bad<br/>dude to have a bunch of teachers spooked."<p>Daisuke said, "That must be why he IS headmaster."<p>Hiroshi said, "Yeah, he out-intimidates the<br/>Intimidators."<p>Daisuke said, "I don't get that intimidated by teachers."<br/>Not that he'd admit, anyway.<p>Kaneda said, "I hope Ranma hasn't skipped school again."<br/>He told his friends, "You know, in Japan, only elementary<br/>and junior high is mandatory. They can't make you go to<br/>high school."<p>Daisuke said, "Tell that to my parents."<p>Hiroshi said, "I'm just glad mine don't send me to cram<br/>school or worse."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Hiroshi looked at his watch, "What's taking so long!<br/>These kinds of assemblies are only supposed to take 25<br/>minutes!"<p>Daisuke said, "You tell me. You're the one who likes to<br/>eavesdrop."<p>Kaneda said, "Damn! Ranma has GOT to have bailed again!<br/>How am I going to keep her in school!"<p>Hiroshi had a fast ear. Turning them first this way, then<br/>that, he reported, "The rumors are the teachers aren't<br/>unhappy JUST about getting a new acting headmaster."<p>Kaneda crossed his arms, and slumped down in his chair.<br/>"Why are we saying "headmaster", and not principal?"<br/>He was sitting on Ranma's uniform.<p>Daisuke had a suggestion, "Because the guy's going to<br/>mess with our heads? That's what school's all about,<br/>isn't it."<p>Hiroshi said, "I haven't found out what the problem is,<br/>yet. All of the new guy's records they keep in the<br/>computers are supposed to be okay. But they left some<br/>things out of the records."<p>Daisuke commented, "Hmmph! Okay for a headmaster. That<br/>doesn't mean they're okay for us. Maybe they chose the<br/>guy because he's WORSE than the real headmaster."<p>Kaneda was finally listening to what his friends were<br/>saying, "Why would Nabiki want to do that!" Suddenly he<br/>had a very bad feeling. "-Some things were left out!"<br/>Even a spider can get caught in her own web.<p>The audience stirred and sat up straighter. One of the<br/>teachers had walked onto the stage. It was Kaneda's<br/>history teacher, Mr. Fujiwara, the eldest teacher at<br/>Furinkan. He slammed the book he always carried down on<br/>the podium. Like a gavel, it brought a quiet to the<br/>auditorium.<p>Mr. Fujiwara said, "Before your new acting-headmaster is<br/>introduced I have a few announcements to make." It was<br/>hard to hear the old man's voice because he hadn't turned<br/>the mike on, but everybody wanted to hear. "By agreement<br/>between the new administrator and faculty: (A) Furinkan<br/>will continue to emphasize sports." There was a mixture<br/>or cheers and groans at that news. "But," he got a sour<br/>face at this part, "there will be greater emphasis on<br/>girls' sports." Here, there were more groans than cheers.<br/>"(B) The dress code will NOT be changed. All students<br/>will attend school in the their prescribed uniform." No<br/>one cheered this news; the only groans were from the few<br/>who had believed Nabiki.<p>Kaneda said, "So much for that part of Nabiki's grand<br/>scheme. It doesn't look good for the rest of it."<p>Mr. Fujiwara continued, "And (C) free time between<br/>classes will change from five minutes, and immediately<br/>return to the NORMAL ten minutes." There was a great<br/>cheer at this news. That meant LESS class time, more<br/>goofing off time! And it was something the teachers had<br/>wanted, too.<p>When the noise had died down, the teacher picked up his<br/>book from the podium. "And now, the new<br/>acting -headmaster."<p>A little girl in a yellow dress hopped, skipped and<br/>bounced onto stage. Giving a big wave, she greeted them<br/>with, "Hello, Everybody! My name is Miss Hinako<br/>Ninomiya!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda, Hiroshi, Daisuke-Nobody could believe that this<br/>little kid was going to be their new principal!<p>Ignoring the stunned silence, little Miss Hinako leaned<br/>forward, and wagging a finger, said, "I hope you all will be<br/>GOOD boys and girls!"<p>Not only was she a little kid, she acted like a little<br/>kid! A cutsey one!<p>She straightened up, "Because if you're not-I PUNISH<br/>naughty, naughty children!"<p>What? THIS kawaii elementary schoolgirl was going to<br/>punish THEM! Power had already gone to her head.<br/>Furinkan High WAS somebody's little kingdom, and his<br/>little princess daughter had taken over!<p>Miss Hinako said confidently, "Now I know you don't<br/>believe me! But I I've already cleaned up TWO reform<br/>schools!"<p>Reform schools? What did she do, kill them with cavities?<br/>Kaneda had heard of some STRANGE martial arts techniques.<br/>Maybe she had filled the schools up with sugar and then<br/>flooded them with water until the delinquents were<br/>trapped in the heavy syrup.<p>No, she had said "cleaned up".<p>Kaneda started to imagine techniques that involved<br/>household cleansers. She WAS at the age where girls liked<br/>to play house, wasn't she?<p>Suddenly the silence was broken when a girl stood up in<br/>the front row a section across from where Kaneda sat.<br/>When he saw who it was, HE almost rose out of his seat.<br/>Nabiki asked, "Miss Hinako, will you recognize special<br/>exceptions to the dress code? ...Like, say, Chinese<br/>clothes?"<p>Somebody cried out in surprise: "OH-W-Oww!" It was<br/>Ranma-chan jumping out of the audience like somebody had<br/>goosed her. She landed near Nabiki. The girl in the Chinese<br/>clothes was still dripping wet.<p>She confronted the wise acre sister, "Hey! Don't try and<br/>help me!"<p>Miss Hinako said, "Oh, that is just not RIGHT! You don't<br/>look like a proper young lady at all!"<p>Ranma-chan turned to and looked up onto the stage,<br/>"That's because I'm NOT a proper lady at all!"<p>Miss Hinako had her long sleeves up in front of her<br/>mouth; wide-eyed she asked, "Does that mean you admit to<br/>being a delinquent?"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Of COURSE not!"<p>Miss Hinako frowned, "You SOUND like a delinquent! Only<br/>delinquents yell at their elders!"<p>Nabiki explained, "Please understand, Miss Hinako," She<br/>did a brief turn to address the auditorium as well,<br/>"...and everybody. Ranma has special problems. You see,<br/>her father craved a son so badly he refused to accept her as<br/>a girl. Ranma has been raised to believe she was, in fact, a<br/>guy, and..." She did her melodramatic turn again, "Well, it's<br/>a common enough tale in Japanese literature. I'm sure<br/>you've heard them."<p>There WERE stories like that. And knowledge of them<br/>brought murmurs and nods of agreement that it was<br/>possible. Both girls and guys voiced their sympathy.<br/>Quiet a few said they'd like to help the poor, confused<br/>girl.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "That's a LIE! I AM a guy!"<p>Nabiki said in her level serious voice, "Then why does<br/>ALL your computer records, and most of your paper ones,<br/>from your birth certificate on, show that you are, and<br/>always HAVE been a girl."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "They do not!"<p>Nabiki smirked, triumphantly, as she was finally able to<br/>reveal, "They do now. Ranma Saotome as a male officially<br/>exists only as a deluded fantasy. Welcome to MY gender.<br/>Checkmate."<p>Miss Hinako blinked, " "Ranma Saotome", you say? WHY that<br/>was the name on the forms I got assigning me to this<br/>school. Ranma Saotome is my special project!"<p>The End of this chapter<p>[For those who asked, "Checkmate" means "Same sex<br/>means no marriage." The way for their mating is checked.<br/>Ranma as a girl can't be engaged to another girl. But Kei<br/>can.]<p>[I am not forcing Ranma to be a girl. Unlike other stories,<br/>Ranma is free to be a guy or a girl; he is only officially a<br/>girl, now. Kei isn't. Ranma and Kaneda are only being forced<br/>to come to terms with their girl halves so they can come to an<br/>agreement about who will be the girl. With their girl bodies<br/>come girl brains; they can adjust to being girls just as much<br/>as they allow themselves to.]<p>[Besides hacking, Zyunzi Ozu used his computer skills to<br/>figure out how to best use his ninja skills. What records his<br/>computer couldn't change, his burglary ones could.]<p>["Tomobiki" means "Friend-Pulling", which is why you do<br/>NOT want to hold a funeral on that day, but DO want to<br/>hold a wedding. That's why it is a VERY bad luck day for<br/>Ranma.]<p>[You can't date these stories from the title. Because I<br/>like this title, the calendar in this alternativerse is<br/>out of sync with ours.]
