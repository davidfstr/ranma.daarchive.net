</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>20: Concepts Unleashed<br/>As much as he tried to not let it bother him, it still<br/>rubbed at him. Last night Kaneda, had had to play keepaway<br/>from an opponent. The better martial artist the heir to the<br/>Tendou Dojo faced had been his own fiancee.<p>It was clear with only a slight chill this morning. The<br/>longhaired redhead jogged in his running shoes, blue shorts<br/>and yellow, short sleeve sweatshirt, with a short towel<br/>around his neck. His muscles could be seen as they moved,<br/>even in his arms. Especially those of his arms. While the<br/>"Anything" of "Anything-Goes Martial Arts" required the<br/>ability to use any muscle group, the Tendou School put the<br/>emphasis on those of the upper body.<p>The Saotome School put the emphasis on those of the lower<br/>body.<p>Slowing down, Kaneda resorted to his usual method of<br/>letting off steam, but this time he used an imaginary<br/>cinderblock. He threw it up with one hand and smashed it to<br/>pieces with the other as it came down.<p>He stopped to look down at the where they could've landed<br/>on the street in front of his home. Why HAVEN'T I done<br/>anything like that before? I've blamed Dad for not training<br/>me properly. He didn't find any satisfaction in helping<br/>Ranma-chan knock out his dad last night. And sleeping on it<br/>hadn't helped at all. ...If I really WAS serious about<br/>being a true master, I would've worked to develop the<br/>skills I DO have. He turned away in total dissatisfaction,<br/>My techniques have just been stunts, nothing serious. He<br/>may've been exaggerating, but like exaggerations, there was<br/>a truth in it.<p>As he headed for his front gate, he glanced up at its<br/>fortress-like wall he knew Ranma-chan could leap over.<br/>There would only be one way he could learn to jump it.<br/>"...Then I would be admitting whose was the better<br/>school...and who was going to be the Master of the Dojo."<br/>At that painful thought, he dug his strong, fingers into<br/>the texture of the wall.<p>"Tendou Upper Body Whip Crack!"<p>In that one thrust, Kaneda pulled himself up the wall like<br/>a rock climber. When his knees were at the height of his<br/>hands, he dug his shoe's toes in and grabbed for the terra<br/>cotta tiles of the wall's roof.<p>He hung there as he refocused his efforts. There were<br/>dozens of minor but important muscle readjustments he<br/>needed to make. He could make them all at once with the<br/>right concept. Then his Chi energy would flow through the<br/>proper channels and charge his body. And yelling out the<br/>concept increased the definiteness of that power.<p>"Tendou Tarzan Ascend!"<p>As quickly as a jolt, Kaneda cleared the eave and landed<br/>crouching on to top of the wall's roof. It surprised him at<br/>just how right the silly concept WAS.<p>Until he realized humans WERE ape-men; upper-body strength<br/>WAS their natural forte.<p>Not lower-body strength.<p>He rose and surveyed his domain, that which was his to<br/>inherit: The Tendou compound.<p>He saw what was becoming a familiar scene: "I'm not going<br/>to go easy on you, Ranma!" Mr. Saotome yelled from beside<br/>the koi pond.<p>The pigtailed guy in just a tank shirt and boxers yelled,<br/>"You NEVER go easy on me! Every time I improve, you take it<br/>up a notch! Well, you're at the end of your belt, now, you<br/>Fat Old Man!"<p>"I'll show you just how fat I am!"<p>Ranma was the first to leap. Splash!<p>"Nnnyyaaarrh!" a very wet Nabiki cried from the garden<br/>hall. The wave of cold pond water had shot straight for<br/>teen in green pajamas. She dropped her camera.<p>The pigtailed girl in the wet underwear gloated, "Got her!"<p>Genma asked, "You jumped in just to do that!"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "And this!" shoving against his shins.<br/>She leaped out of the pond as he was falling in. Using her<br/>speed on her distracted "sensei", she untied his black<br/>belt.<p>By the time the giant panda was able to stand up in the<br/>shallow water, the redhead was tying the belt around the<br/>white coat she'd taken off of the Old Man.<p>"Berao, waorru!"<p>She walked away from it, "Aw, it was only gonna disappear,<br/>anyway. You don't need clothes; you got fur, now."<p>Suddenly her trained senses warned of something on her<br/>right coming towards her.<p>Kaneda used a branch from the tree to catapult himself over<br/>the bushes that helped divide the front of the yard from<br/>the pond side. He landed on his hands and somersaulted,<br/>stopping decimeters from Ranma-chan.<p>The girl was unimpressed, "What kind of stunt was that?"<p>Kaneda said, proudly, "THAT was not a stunt: That was-"<br/>Suddenly his arms shook. The tremors traveled through his<br/>body, until he had to drop to his knees.<p>The small girl said, "Uh, hunh. Not a stunt," and walked<br/>away.<p>The redhaired guy wanted to make a fist, but could barely<br/>get his thumb up; "I just over-exerted myself, doing this<br/>after I'd just cross-trained for 10-k!"<p>Picking up the towel she'd had left lying in the garden<br/>porch. "Will breakfast be ready, soon, Kasumi?"<p>Struggling back to his feet, Kaneda his fingers were still<br/>bent from swinging in trees, "You know what it can be like<br/>when mastering a new technique: A lot of the leftover Chi<br/>doesn't find its way back-"<p>The black-and-white beast bellowed as it charged. The<br/>Tendou boy was in its way. It didn't care. It bumped him.<p>K-Prap!<p>```<p>Kaneda woke up at the feel of hot water. With an hourglass<br/>figure, now, she opened her eyes to see Ranma-chan's bare<br/>legs walking back to the house with the copper teakettle.<p>Kane-chan sat up and saw the panda lying on the ground like<br/>a rug. The last thing she remembered was the Chi-equivalent<br/>of a large static shock leave her guy-body. He had no idea<br/>how. But he wasn't going to let it circle around in his<br/>thoughts.<p>Getting up, Kane-chan asked, "Why did you make me a girl?"<p>Ranma-chan answered, "Why not? If I'm gonna be a girl, you<br/>might as well be one too."<p>She looked at the cold water of the pond. But decided to<br/>follow her cute fiancee back into the family room, "You're<br/>staying a girl?"<p>Setting the kettle down, Ranma said, "I'm going to go to<br/>school like this, too." She looked down at the wet tank<br/>shirt and oversized gi-coat, "I am gonna wear something<br/>else."<p>Kane-chan hoped, "A school uniform?"<p>Ranma-chan plopped down at the table, "Get real. I guess<br/>I'm gonna wear those Chinese clothes your doctor gave me."<p>Kane-chan sat where she could get a good view of Ranma-<br/>chan's boobs under her plastered down shirt that the<br/>overlarge gi-coat couldn't hide very well; "Maybe I<br/>shouldn't question a wish coming true, but why are you<br/>staying a girl?"<p>Nabiki could be heard before she could be seen, "Ranma!"<br/>She entered the family room in her school uniform. She was<br/>very wet. "How did you get smart enough to rig a bucket of<br/>water to spill on me when I opened the lav door!"<p>Showing no glee or regret, Ranma-chan said casually, "Pop<br/>did things like that to me lots of times. His little booby<br/>traps helped sharpen my awareness and senses."<p>Getting her voice more back under control, Nabiki said, "I<br/>can make booby traps that he could not possibly even<br/>conceive of."<p>Kane-chan said, "Ouch."<p>Nabiki turned her cold glare at blackhaired girl, "Do you<br/>WANT me to make the term "booby trap" literal?"<p>Kane-chan had to hesitate, "Er... It might be less painful<br/>if you did." She knew her sister prided herself on her<br/>creating situations.<p>Some of Nabiki's aplomb returned, "You've got that right."<p>From the garden hall, her father said, "Ha, ha! Don't let<br/>my daughter Nabiki's words mislead you, Miss Akane. She<br/>really has a warm and gentle heart."<p>Kane-chan looked at the father figure with the toothbrush.<br/>She had to ask, "Just how well do you know people?"<p>Soun Tendou said in his most charming fashion, "Before I<br/>took on the responsibilities of a single parent, I traveled<br/>all over, meeting every sort of person." He got a bit<br/>nostalgic, "Why I've even been off the islands of Japan.<br/>I've been to Hawaii. That's in America, you know."<p>Ranma asked, "You didn't swim there, did you?" For someone<br/>who'd swam to China, even she found that difficult to<br/>believe.<p>Soun chuckled, "I didn't have to. I had a tsunami wave."<p>Nabiki said, "Now, you want to reminisce! Daddy, I know you<br/>want to impress a certain some one, but right now-"<p>Kane-chan was curious. It wasn't too often he would tell<br/>them anything about himself. "How did you get back, a<br/>reverse-tsunami?"<p>Soun Tendou smiled down at the charming Miss Akane, "My<br/>word, no. I used a geyser."<p>Kane-chan suddenly thought of something, "You got home<br/>using a geyser? Is, isn't a geyser like a spring?"<p>Soun was still smiling, his battle to be a gentleman<br/>temporarily lost as he stared at Kane-chan's bare legs,<br/>"VERY hot springs."<p>Kane-chan tried to add something up, "I know about the<br/>Curse of Pelee. Doesn't that mean there could be other<br/>curses in Hawaii?"<p>Ranma-chan asked, "Are you sayin' your dad might've been<br/>cursed, too?" She studied the mustached man. "That would<br/>explain things."<p>Kane-chan said, "Well, magic does attract magic."<p>Nabiki said, "A good reason not to believe in it. The best<br/>remedy against magic is not to accept it in the first<br/>place. Let it happen to those with weak minds."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Who're sayin' has a weak mind!"<p>Kasumi had come in with a breakfast tray, and heard enough<br/>to ask, "A cursed spring? But there are no dragons in<br/>Hawaii, are there?"<p>Her father's eye twinkled, "The only one I know of was the<br/>dragon kite I rode over the Pacific on." Miss Akane had<br/>very nice legs.<p>Kane-chan asked Kasumi, "What's this about dragons?"<p>Kasumi greeted, "Hello, Mr. Saotome. Breakfast is ready."<p>Ranma-chan frowned at it, "You play bear rug until it's<br/>time to eat. I thought you wanted to fight? Ha-nh! You<br/>couldn't even beat a guy who was ready to drop from<br/>fatigue."<p>Kane-chan asked, "Is that what happened?" Her mind divided<br/>between dragons, what had happened outside, breakfast and<br/>the back-and-forth of everybody but Kasumi, she didn't find<br/>the answer to any of the questions.<p>```<p>After changing to a dry school uniform, Nabiki hurried to<br/>leave.<p>But the closed front gate was stuck. Even when she used<br/>both hands, it still wouldn't open. There was something<br/>small on the other side that was preventing it from<br/>opening. "Ranma!" she concluded.<p>She refused to give Ranma the satisfaction of showing any<br/>frustration. Assuming that was what Saotome wanted to see,<br/>and so wouldn't take the side gate, she waited as calmly as<br/>she could. She sought to keep her Chi-void from collapsing.<br/>If the martial artist got emotional enough, SHE would be<br/>ready to turn it back on the baka. And the more emotional<br/>she could make the pigtailed one, the harder would be the<br/>fall.<p>Finally the heavy gate opened behind her. Ranma-chan was on<br/>the other side. The pigtailed girl in the black, silk<br/>Chinese shirt and pants was flipping and catching a shim.<br/>There was a proverb in there about how a small wedge of<br/>wood could stop a huge door from opening.<p>Nabiki was in no mood for trite analogies. The only thing<br/>she wanted to hear was how Ranma had turned the tables on<br/>her. SAOTOME was more the sap type. ...And Ranma would be<br/>again, she vowed.<p>Ranma-chan asked, "Ready to go to school?"<p>He chin tilted up, Nabiki began her trip to school.<p>"Tendou Tarzan Ascend!"<p>A moment later, Kaneda dropped from over the compound wall<br/>to the street ahead of them. In his school uniform, he<br/>landed on his hands and swung up to his feet in NEARLY one<br/>motion. He did need practice.<p>Ranma-chan passed him, "That's so uncute. Why can't you at<br/>least TRY to act less like a guy."<p>Exasperated, Kaneda pointed to the wall, "I just did what<br/>YOU can do: But without using my legs!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Big whoop. What if the wall had been<br/>ancient, unstable, booby trapped, or electrified."<p>Kaneda caught up to her and Nabiki, "But it wasn't!"<p>Nabiki told them, "Why do you both of you simpletons have<br/>the need to exert yourselves, anyway? If the wall had been<br/>any of those things, it would've been for strategic<br/>reasons. Understand those and the resources available, and<br/>you can figure out a less strenuous way in or out of<br/>things."<p>Ranma-chan scoffed, "Like how you got the gate open?"<p>Nabiki said coolly, "You opened it for me, didn't you?"<p>Ranma-chan scoffed, "Like you had it planned."<p>Nabiki said coolly, "I figured it out. ...As I will figure<br/>you out...again." It had probably started when Ranma-chan<br/>was caught naked in the guys' lav and then got stuck among<br/>the girls in the girls' locker room...<p>Kaneda broke in with, "I got over the wall! The Tendou<br/>School can match the Saotome School!"<p>Ranma-chan jumped on top of the nearest privacy wall; "A<br/>stunt doesn't prove anything."<p>Scowling at her stunt, Kaneda started to wonder how he<br/>could walk walls using just his Tendou skills.<p>```<p>Anything Kaneda said he may have said to the walls along<br/>their way. Neither Ranma-chan nor Nabiki were paying him<br/>much attention. They were both focused on the school day<br/>ahead.<p>For once it looked like the he and Ranma-chan were going to<br/>make it to class early. The big school clock said "8:20".<br/>That was part of the reason there were a number of students<br/>around the front gate. But among them were several diehards<br/>from Kaneda's previous mornings' battle.<p>Kaneda prepared himself for another.<p>Behind him: Ranma-chan pounced, "Nabiki-chan!"<p>Nabiki had seen this coming since last night. She used her<br/>aikido skills to anticipate and avoid the little redhead<br/>WITHOUT touching her. It was done with the minimum of<br/>motion and seeming effort. Inside, though, she was<br/>struggling to draw in Ranma's Chi. But Ranma was using her<br/>emotions in a way Nabiki wasn't used to. The Chi was put<br/>more into propelling than attacking.<p>Ranma-chan landed and in one fluid motion tried again.<p>Nabiki took a couple of steps, and bowed her head just<br/>enough for Ranma-chan to whiz past. But Ranma-chan<br/>ricocheted off the wall and back at her. With relief,<br/>Nabiki became a matador, pivoting out of the way on one<br/>foot.<p>Ranma-chan landed against the distracted Kaneda. Kaneda<br/>automatically moved to cushion the impact and keep his<br/>fiancee from falling. That meant he fell with her on top of<br/>him.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Thanks for the help!"<p>Kaneda told her, "You jumped me!"<p>Nabiki looked down at the petit girl still in the arms of<br/>her brother; "I left my pants at home. I thought you didn't<br/>go after those who wear skirts." Literally, it was true.<br/>Ranma swore not to fight girls.<p>Ranma's emotions shifted, "What!" Nabiki got her!<p>Nabiki straightened herself up, "Is THAT why you want to<br/>marry into the Tendous? Ranma! I'm supposed to be your<br/>'SISTER-in-law' We Tendou girls don't swing that way." She<br/>started to walk away, "I guess you're going to have to be<br/>satisfied with just my LITTLE brother."<p>Her back to Ranma-chan now, she gave the guys who were<br/>witnessing all of this a knowing look. She said in a voice<br/>for them, "...As if Kaneda alone could satisfy a person<br/>with a girl's BODY and a guy's mind."<p>"Whoa! I didn't think of that."/ "Does that mean she,<br/>like, has to have, one of each?"/ "Maybe that's why she's<br/>engaged to Kaneda."/ "HA! That's why he needs to beat<br/>guys up!"/ "-Why he's so angry!"/ "Right! He's trying<br/>to prove he's NOT half-a-man!"<p>As she passed through the group of mainly guys, Nabiki<br/>helped the sale along, "It has become a contest to see who<br/>will be wear the apron."<p>Ranma struggled to get up from Kaneda, "Let me at her!"<p>Kaneda held her back. He wasn't going to let her get away<br/>with it now that her Karma was unprotected, "Why not tell<br/>them who you're engaged to!" Of course, if she told them<br/>ALL of the truth, he'd be seen as a far greater pervert<br/>than Ranma.<p>Nabiki didn't even slow down as she approached Furinkan's<br/>main doors; "I don't take that seriously. Do you?"<p>```<p>First Vice President and Secretary Tsugako was waiting on<br/>the front stoop for her as Nabiki had told her to in a call<br/>last night. She asked, "What was that about?"<p>Nabiki told her, "Merchandising. Did you get those photos I<br/>gave you copied?"<p>Tsugako showed her the filing folder under her arm.<br/>"They're pictures of Ranma only half-dressed." She lowered<br/>voice, questioning the wisdom of her President, "They're<br/>almost pornographic!"<p>Nabiki said, "And they'll stay soft until demand falls<br/>off."<p>Tsugako asked, "What demand?"<p>Nabiki looked out to the guys waiting around the gate and<br/>the engaged pair who was just approaching it; "The demand<br/>for a real-life fantasy that's short in supply."<p>```<p>Ranma-chan and Kaneda would find that the emphasis was on<br/>"real-life". What may be unthinkable in isolation can<br/>burrow into a psyche when there is an actual example that<br/>can be seen, heard, smelled, and, perhaps...touched?<p>The first to speak up were those who still had something to<br/>prove: "Ha, ha! Kaneda! How'd you get so 'luc-key'?"/ "I<br/>can't believe we hadn't thought WHY she would stick with<br/>you!"/ "I bet she can beat your sorry ass!"<p>Kaneda's reactions were never as cool and calm as Nabiki's,<br/>"If she could, what does that say about YOU! There hasn't<br/>been a day this semester I haven't beat yours and twenty<br/>others!"<p>"Ranma, how much of a girl are you?"/ "You look like you<br/>have everything..."/ "...perfect..."/ "You definitely<br/>have female hormones."/ "But you think like, a guy?"/<br/>"She dresses like a guy."/ "Is it possible that, that,<br/>uh, er, both ways, I mean, threesomes, I mean-"/ "Oh,<br/>ho, ho! There's something I've dreamed about..."/ "But<br/>have you thought about doing it with somebody who's both?"<p>Ranma-chan's reactions were somewhere in-between the two<br/>Tendous, "Leave me alone! I ain't interested in anybody,<br/>girl and ESPECIALLY guy!"<p>People ahead of them started moving aside for an all too<br/>familiar voice, "She is trying to tell you, you spawn of<br/>the bourgeois media, that as with any true warrior, she is<br/>celebrate. One must be pure of heart to wield power<br/>properly." Kuno was in his usual kendo-gi, holding his<br/>usual wooden sword. The only thing different were the<br/>bandages that he was still wrapped in.<p>"But Nabiki said-"<p>The still recovering Kuno held up his bokken in challenge<br/>to the pigtailed girl, "But purity is but purified more<br/>intensely when mixed with its own kind. Two becoming one<br/>bring forth more than just what either alone can do."<p>"I'd go with Nabiki this time. I bet Ranma can't stay<br/>'pure' any more than Kuno can."/ "Care to start a pool of<br/>how long she can last?"/ "And cut into Nabiki's<br/>territory!"<p>Ranma-chan grabbed the dim wit's only weapon with both<br/>hands, "Thanks for giving them explanations!"<p>Behind her, Kaneda pleaded, "Ranma!"<p>Growling, Ranma-chan planted her small feet and used her<br/>superior lower body muscles to heave the 185.5 cm/6' 1"<br/>teen off the ground, and toss him behind her.<p>...where Kaneda punched the samurai boy into his<br/>tormentors, toppling them all.<p>With his breath nearly knocked out of him, the rugby player<br/>tried to threaten, "Pervert!...Both, perverts..."<p>"They are perverts, aren't they?"<p>"I wouldn't say it to their faces."/ "And as a martial<br/>arts fan, I'd also say not within rage of their martial<br/>arts senses."/ "Uh...how safe a distance is safe?"<p>```<p>Looking out a window above in Classroom 2-F, Nabiki smiled<br/>to herself, "That suppresses the negative backlash for a<br/>while. And what fills a vacuum?..."<p>Tsugako looked to Nabiki. "If she really doesn't get<br/>around, I can see where the, uh, "supply" will be limited.<br/>There's not going to be too many who are going to risk even<br/>asking Ranma for a date, let alone trying for first base.<br/>But are you sure about the demand?"<p>Second Vice President and Treasurer Ichie said, "Yeah,<br/>Nabiki, don't guys have better things to think about than a<br/>super tomboy?"<p>Nabiki said to them, "It's all about contrasts. To them,<br/>she's already a tomboy that flashes, and, now, maybe does<br/>more."<p>Ichie said, "So she's a tease!"<p>Tsugako said, "And she's not even good at it. She's no<br/>competition."<p>Ichie saw a glimmer of the truth, " "Contrast"?"<p>Followed by her company, Nabiki headed towards her desk,<br/>"Exactly. There is too much competition: Among ourselves.<br/>But no one (right now, anyway *Chuckle*) is competing with<br/>her. But Ranma's a natural at getting attention, beyond her<br/>petit attractiveness. She's the speeding red dot on a<br/>mountain of black. That is the first step in demand.<p>"And after that, everything depends on her entertainment<br/>value, where the potential customer WANTS to keep their<br/>attention on her."<p>Ichie said, "You mean "Sex and Violence"?..."<p>Tsugako said sourly, "In Ranma's case, "Cuteness and<br/>Mayhem"."<p>Nabiki addressed her followers, "There is no real contrast<br/>there. That's on the TV that comes into our houses.<br/>Entertainment relies on something being different among the<br/>familiar or attractive."<p>Ichie said, "Contrast!"<p>Nabiki sat down at her desk-seat as if it were her throne.<br/>"Ranma has something very different about her." She smiled,<br/>"She has a strangeness factor that can become exotic that<br/>can become erotic. It is all in niche-marketing." She had<br/>started thinking about this plan back when Kaneda had<br/>started getting boobs. But Kaneda WAS family. Ranma wasn't.<p>Tsugako shook her head, "And giving out free pictures of<br/>Ranma taking off her shirt supplies a niche?"<p>Nabiki chuckled, "There is nothing really that strange<br/>about a girl taking off even a guy's undershirt. What will<br/>make it strange is the "Before and After" contrast.<p>"And even though guys can't see past a girl's looks, I<br/>think it will be more profitable if Ranma's female assets<br/>are etched in their little minds BEFORE they see the, uh,<br/>'After'."<p>Ichie thought she understood, "You get them nibbling before<br/>they're introduced to the hook."<p>```<p>Kaneda's new interest in Tarzan had him looking at the<br/>trees that separated the main buildings from the playing<br/>fields of the school. "Do you want to have a contest,<br/>Ranma? A race through the trees to see who can get to<br/>Lovers' Wood first."<p>Ranma-chan didn't even look at him. "I'm not interested in<br/>you proving your so-called manhood. I have you around to<br/>remind me what will happen if I forget what sex I am."<p>Kaneda challenged, "This is about schools!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "If you say so."<p>Kaneda wanted to say something loud, long and punctuated<br/>with martial arts. But his school wasn't at Ranma's level,<br/>yet. The only way he could inflict a little hard was by<br/>using the girl-ploy-and only on the Ranma-kun. Of course,<br/>if his girl-form 'demonstrated' on Ranma-kun it would PROVE<br/>it wasn't about his manhood.<p>Right?... As he looked back towards the trees, he saw that<br/>there were holes bored in a lot of them, three to a tree.<br/>Pausing to glance through a few of them, he saw direct line<br/>of sight views of the school buildings and the playing<br/>fields. "Whoever Miss Hinako hired got the job done in<br/>record time."<p>Ranma-chan said, "She had to have hired a whole<br/>construction company." The tree house 2.5 meters/8' off the<br/>ground had the general shape of a large forest ranger<br/>station, with a chicken wire with circular holes in its<br/>mesh. It even had three sliding skylights over holes in its<br/>three-sided roof. But Ranma and Kaneda, not understanding<br/>how the technique they yearned to learn from the age-<br/>changing Miss Hinako worked, paid more attention to the<br/>paint job. They had been afraid she would paint her<br/>principal's office with bright garish, kiddy-pleasing<br/>colors. Nabiki had done her best to convince the new<br/>acting-principal that since she was now in charge of an<br/>institution of high education, it needed to be in the same<br/>colors as the institutions she was familiar with.<p>Ranma-chan stared at it. "Well, she did choose gray."<p>Kaneda stared, too. "And black. -Is that Astro Boy?" The<br/>tree house office was covered with black-and-white anime<br/>characters from the '60's. Just how old was Miss Hinako<br/>really?<p>```<p>Inside the plush characters were more colorful, but there<br/>were fewer of them. There was a TV-VCR to watch them on,<br/>and a Playstation. There was a small assortment of coloring<br/>books, toys and games, but they off in a neatly ordered,<br/>unused corner of what otherwise looked pretty much as a<br/>principal's office should look like.<p>When they came up through the open doorway in the floor,<br/>they found that Miss Hinako was no little girl. Her tall,<br/>shapely and buxom form was in a rather bulky, yellow<br/>crochet sweater and a black skirt with a hem a couple of<br/>centimeters above the knee. "Miss Ranma," she greeted her<br/>as a student. She then said, "And this must be Mr. Kaneda<br/>Tendou. Miss Saotome is your houseguest, I believe." When<br/>they'd nodded their heads in a bow, she gestured them<br/>towards her desk.<p>Kaneda followed, "The reason we're always late won't happen<br/>tomorrow. Probably. -There were fewer guys waiting for us.<br/>There should be fewer still tomorrow. ...Right?"<p>The adult kept her eye on him as she sat on the edge of the<br/>desk, one fine leg bent. "You two aren't here for that<br/>reason. As part of the agreement I made with the teachers<br/>to recognize me as the acting-principal, I am to let them<br/>decide when a low-Chi conflict goes beyond what they term<br/>"a sporting challenge".<p>"Sports are the main reason for this school's existence,<br/>apparently. That makes Furinkan something of a vocational<br/>high school."<p>Kaneda said to the woman who was keeping her eyes on him,<br/>"And you heard I was the best athlete in the school."<p>Miss Hinako was pleased, "You are?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "I'm the reason you called us here."<p>The woman finally turned her attention to the girl, "Yes,<br/>Miss Ranma. One of the concessions the teachers gave ME was<br/>that there would be more emphasis on girls' sports."<p>Ranma-chan said, "I am not a team player."<p>Miss Hinako said, "There are non-team sports."<p>Ranma-chan said, "I can't change with girls."<p>Miss Hinako raised an eyebrow, "Oh? Do you have a<br/>condition? A deformity?" Ranma-chan didn't like the way she<br/>was checking for them.<p>Ranma-chan tried again, "It'd be like cheatin'. I'm<br/>different from, most girls." All, if you excluded the ones<br/>who must've been cursed over the centuries.<p>The Principal stood up, "I sensed that yesterday. Your Chi<br/>is the most masculine I've felt in a female. It is very<br/>polar." And this from a reform school teacher.<p>Kaneda picked up his ears, "Oh? So she's mostly a girl,<br/>right?"<p>Miss Hinako said to him, "And yours is definitely the most<br/>feminine I've felt in a male. Again, with practically no<br/>blending of the two."<p>Kaneda blushed.<p>Ranma, "That proves it for me."<p>The Principal went around her desk, "Though you are not<br/>related, you both have a similar...let us say "Yin-Yang<br/>Flux"." Both of the teens waited tensely for the truth to<br/>be spoken. "But, then, you both practice "Anything-Goes<br/>Martial Arts."<p>The teens facefaulted.<p>"The same as me."<p>From the floor the said in surprise, "You!"<p>She leaned over the desk; "My variation of the "Anything-<br/>Goes School" left me with, an age problem." There was a<br/>brief flash of resentment. "Yours has given you...another<br/>problem. I would like to help you, if I can."<p>Ranma was the first to jump up, "You think you can!" Was<br/>there hope?<p>Standing straight again, Miss Hinako said, "I think I may<br/>be able to help. But it can only be performed while you are<br/>doing sports, Miss Ranma. That is why you have to<br/>participate."<p>Ranma grinned to break her cute face, "You got it! I'll<br/>give just about anything a try!"<p>Pleased, the trained reform school teacher said, "Let's be<br/>positive!" It felt good to be able to encourage rather than<br/>punish. The correctional officers and the students only<br/>took her seriously when she used her powers. Furinkan was<br/>her chance to prove she could do more. And Ranma Saotome<br/>was her test case.<p>Kaneda hesitated. "And, and me? Is, is that why you, wanted<br/>me here, too?"<p>Feeling good for once without any childish (or a couple of<br/>more adult) diversions, Miss Hinako said to him, "If my<br/>idea works for Miss Ranma, it will point the way for you,<br/>Mr. Kaneda. But it will require more thought, I'm afraid. I<br/>will let you know when I have thought of the missing piece<br/>to the puzzle. But I promise to do it in private.<p>"But in the meantime, I wanted to meet Miss Ranma's<br/>support, her...finace(?)"<p>Her smiled grew slightly wider; "You remind me of Miss<br/>Akane Saotome, Ranma's cousin."<p>Though Kaneda didn't understand yet, Miss Hinako's Chi<br/>power hadn't had much direct contact with Kaneda's girl-<br/>form; the readings she had of her was swamped out by<br/>Ranma's, her focus at the time. And now, through the holes<br/>in the trees, she was feeding on the Chi of the whole<br/>school. Though it kept her an adult, it took effort to<br/>distinguish between individuals. Right then, she was in<br/>near her optimum capacity. The former little girl with the<br/>short attention span so far wasn't aware yet of the effect<br/>Chi has on living trees.<p>Of course, even trees have their limits.<p>```<p>On their way back to the classroom, Kaneda wondered, "If<br/>she knows our secret, why did she say I reminded her of<br/>Akane?"<p>Ranma was just too happy at the thought of a cure, "So? She<br/>knows our secret, not the names we call our other forms."<p>Kaneda still fretted, "Should we tell her?"<p>Ranma said, "A secret's a secret until there's no need for<br/>reason for it."<p>Kaneda said, "I guess you're right. I can hide out from her<br/>making me a girl by being Akane Saotome."<p>Ranma said, "Me, I was gettin' sick of hidin'. I was about<br/>ready to show everybody I AM a guy."<p>Kaneda thought for long moments. "Ranma. Are you sure you<br/>don't want to be a girl?"<p>Ranma laughed humorlessly, "What do you think!"<p>```<p>Kaneda thought of something else, "She says she belongs to<br/>the "Anything-Goes School". How many have YOU heard say<br/>that?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Don't worry about it. If you have to, ask<br/>the Two Fathers about it."<p>Kaneda muttered, "If Dad will talk about it."<p>When they opened their classroom door: Bang! Pop, pop, pop!<br/>Whiz-Bang!<p>Kaneda grabbed the back of Ranma-chan's collar and shirt<br/>back to keep her from using her martial arts.<p>The National Anthem of the United States of America started<br/>playing, then sung in English: "O say can you see by the<br/>dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd, Whose broad<br/>stripes and bright stars, Thro' the perilous fight, O'er<br/>the ramparts we watched, Were gallantly streaming? And the<br/>rocket's red glare, The bombs bursting in air..."<p>Bang! Pop, pop, pop! Whiz-Bang!<p>Kaneda directed Ranma-chan as inconspicuously as they could<br/>to their seats, while the smaller redhead stared at their<br/>homeroom teacher. She had thought he was a fairly fit man<br/>in his thirties who was as dull as most teachers. Kaneda<br/>told her quietly, "Mr. Egami earned his tuition working as<br/>a magician in a theme park. He almost quit the idea of<br/>teaching to go into special effects."<p>With a flag waving scene from an American production on the<br/>chalkboard behind the man, Ranma-chan had to ask, "Why<br/>didn't he?"<p>Kaneda sat her down in her desk-seat; "He says computers<br/>have taken the wonder-factor out of it."<p>The fireworks and lightshow over, Mr. Egami said, "Now, as<br/>a further reward for finishing your homework tasks on the<br/>Napoleonic Wars, I give you the "Anvil Chorus" of "The 1812<br/>Overture".<p>The scenes on the chalkboard were now ones of Tchaikovsky,<br/>and then an orchestra maestro leading a dirty, bloody<br/>battle of Europeans dressed up like their nutcrackers. And<br/>over the music were the clang of anvils and the boom of<br/>canons! It was a true spectacular production.<p>...And when the lights came on, it seemed the whole class<br/>was glancing, staring, or glaring at Ranma-chan from all<br/>sides.<p>```<p>This class over with, Mr. Egami went to packing up his<br/>equipment to move to them to his next class with the help<br/>of the "Big Production" Club.<p>Meanwhile: "Well, we now know they're real."/ "You don't<br/>think they were...doctored?"/ "What, the pictures or her<br/>boobs?"/ "Either."/ "Who cares. I'd just like to 're-<br/>touch' her."/ "Who's that old guy spraying milk?"/ "Her<br/>old man?"/ "That's Kaneda's dad."/ "No bull, Hiroshi!"/<br/>"Hiroshi, Daisuke, you're Kaneda's best friends. If the<br/>chick flashes at his house, maybe-"/ "Hey, didn't she<br/>flash yesterday, at the gate?"/ "Didn't you hear what she<br/>did in the guys' lav?"...<p>While among the girls: "Flashing in the guys' lav! She IS<br/>an exhibitionist."?/ "Hmf! Like she needs to do that with<br/>a body like that."/ "I say she has been to a doctor."/<br/>"I'm jealous, too."/ Hasn't she heard of a bra?"/ "I<br/>hear she wears guys' underwear."/ "Used?"/ "Stained.<br/>She likes to play with danger."/ "If she wears some guy's<br/>clothes, it she isn't Kaneda Tendou's."/ "That pervert's<br/>so desperate, he's whipped."/ "Get with the program,<br/>Ainoko: Ranma's USING Kaneda."/ "Oh, right. The poor<br/>jerk."...<p>It didn't take Ranma's sensitive ears to hear what was<br/>being said. She burned.<p>Yuka stood by Ranma-chan's side, "It's not Ranma's fault.<br/>Her problems come because her daddy is a girl-hater." And<br/>she put a hand on the girl in Chinese clothes, "You've<br/>never had the chance to be a girl, have you?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "I never WANTED the chance!"<p>Yuka said to the other girls, "See how bad it is?"<p>Daisuke was on the petit redhead's other side, "Ranma, you<br/>can be one of the guys with us."<p>The tall, tough girl No stepped up in front of Ranma-chan,<br/>"And you're guy enough? If Ranma's going to hang out with<br/>anybody, it's going to be with the girls!"<p>"Why do we want to be around a girl who looks at us like a<br/>guy does!"<p>Na slammed an open palm down on a desk. "Because I remember<br/>you girls saying the something like that about me!"<p>"So THAT'S why you want Ranma near you."/ "I hear Ranma<br/>swivels both ways."/ "Yes, she likes girls who act like<br/>guys."/ "And guys who act like girls, I hear."<p>Kaneda said, "-Wait a minute! Why does everybody look at<br/>me when they say things like that! You've never known me<br/>to be a girl! I'm as big a pervert as Hiroshi and Daisuke,<br/>remember?"<p>There were some knowing nods.<p>Sayuri said, "Stop! It's obvious that Ranma didn't pose for<br/>that picture! It's pure voyeurism!"<p>"I love it when girls use words like that."<p>Ranma-chan jumped up from between Yuka and Daisuke, onto<br/>her the back of her desk-seat, and behind to Sayuri. "What<br/>picture?"<p>Sayuri held out a hand, "Hiroshi!"<p>Shamefacedly, looking to the other guys for understanding,<br/>he got out the wrinkled paper her had under his coat.<br/>Sayuri handed it to Ranma.<p>Ranma-chan of course recognized it as one of those Kuno had<br/>had of her girl-form. "Nabiki."<p>"Did you hear that, guys?"/ "You just figure that out?"/<br/>"But if NABIKI Tendou is giving out FREE pictures!"/ "-<br/>They're samples!"<p>"Did you hear that, girls?"/ "I should've thought of<br/>that in the first place."/ "But if Nabiki Tendou is<br/>giving out pictures like this-"/ "Where will it end?"<p>Professional beauty contestant Yuumei Natsume said, "We've<br/>got to stop her before she hands out pictures of me-US!"<p>Designated P.E. Equipment Manager Go-don Amori said, "We've<br/>got to see if she's got to protect Nabiki Tendou!"<p>A squadron of guys and one of girls headed for the door.<p>A plain girl was the last of the group. She hesitated at<br/>the door, uncertain about what she would do. Finally she<br/>said, "I want to be a kogal!" and left.<p>The room now only had a dozen people in it. A stunned<br/>Kaneda asked. "Is this what uncontrolled Karma is like?"<br/>The End of this chapter
