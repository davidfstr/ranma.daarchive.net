</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>11: Go Ahead, Try to Take Her<p>Ranma-chan grabbed a fist full of fur on the panda's<br/>back, "C'mon! We're gonna have a long talk, and YOU ain't<br/>gonna say a word!"<p>Angry, Kane-chan had pulled out a mallet; "Promise me<br/>you'll kill me!" But Ranma continued to ignore her as<br/>she drug the panda out of the narrow alley between the<br/>windowless buildings.<p>As Ranma-chan disappeared around the corner, Kane-chan<br/>yelled, "I won't let you ignore me!" She lifted her<br/>mallet, and began to run-<p>Her dad cried, "Akane!"<p>'Akane' cringed. Reflexively, she stopped and lowered her<br/>"equalizer".<p>Soun Tendou asked, "What do you mean by asking Ranma to<br/>kill you?" He had just entered the other end of the<br/>alley.<p>Kane-chan hid the mallet out of sight; "Er, in case I,<br/>uh, do seppuku. As a test of honor."<p>Soun Tendou shook his head sadly, "Seppuku is not a<br/>"test"." He sighed, "Akane, have your unnatural<br/>inclinations lead you to contemplate-"<p>Kane-chan cried, "No! It's not like that!" as she waved<br/>her empty hands about. So much about leaving Dad behind<br/>to follow Ranma. "It's just that I want Ranma to think<br/>of me, differently." She drew in her breath and risked<br/>her dad hearing her say, "Like a real man."<p>Soun Tendou came to her like a concerned parent, "Akane,<br/>don't throw your womanliness away! Ranma is not who you<br/>think she is."<p>Kane-chan told him, "I know." For a moment she thought he<br/>was going to put an arm around her; "But I KNOW Ranma can<br/>be womanly! We just have to find out what it takes to<br/>overcome her male-conditioning."<p>Before Soun could correct the beautiful stranger, they<br/>heard Kasumi call, "That's right! Ranma can, and must,<br/>try being a girl!" She wasn't in the alley, but the<br/>sounds had echoed out to where Oneesan could hear them.<p>Soun turned and headed for the voice, "Are you SURE,<br/>Kasumi?"<p>Kane-chan joined him, "Are you saying I don't have to be<br/>the girl?"<p>Kasumi was on the grass level below the tier where her<br/>family was; "The goddess will only help Ranma find her<br/>feminine side, if YOU agree to find it as well!"<p>Kane-chan cried, "What! I can't be the man!"<p>At the end of the alley, Soun reached for Kasumi's hand<br/>below; but to Akane said, "So, even in...those kinds of<br/>relations, one is 'the man'."<p>Kasumi waited for Kane-chan to offer help with her other<br/>hand; "Mrs. Priestess assures me one of you will be the<br/>man. But not until you've both passed the tests of being<br/>a woman. Only then can you come to a mutual agreement on<br/>which ones you two will be."<p>By now, Kane-chan had her other hand and arm, and was<br/>prepared to help her dad lift her up the stone terrace<br/>wall; "But I'M the one in dresses!"<p>(Soun said, "And you look lovely in a dress. My dear,<br/>beautiful wife, Kimiko, always wore dresses. (Except when<br/>she was practicing her martial arts, of course.)")<p>The two martial artists lifted Kasumi quickly and easily<br/>up onto their level. They had to hold her aloft, though,<br/>until she had carefully set her pumps down; she didn't<br/>want to twist an ankle. "Oh, my, yes; it would be easier<br/>if Ranma changed clothes as easily as you, Akane. Perhaps<br/>we can find a way. But as Mrs. Priestess said, there is<br/>more to girls than just clothes."<p>Kane-chan agreed, "Yes. When I think of girls, I prefer<br/>to think of something else besides clothes."<p>Kasumi was now standing as firmly as one could in heels;<br/>"Just as with that tale of the tortoise and the bunny,<br/>the contest is not won by who has the head start...or<br/>something like that."<p>Kane-chan liked the analogy, And I WON'T win the race to<br/>be the girl if I am the hare.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Meanwhile, Ranma-chan was telling the panda, "...that's<br/>why you'll leave this to me!" Again, she broke the<br/>panda's sign. "...I let you arrange a marriage for me<br/>before I was born," She smashed another sign, "but WHICH<br/>one I'm gonna get stuck with is still up to me!" As soon<br/>as the panda raised a sign, it was kindling. "And as long<br/>as that crazy Kaneda stays up at bat," She splintered the<br/>someteenth one. "I just hafta make sure I'm the same<br/>sex," She karate chopped down this sign's post. "and I<br/>NOTHING can be official!" Using her arms violently while<br/>she had boobs didn't help her mood.<p>"HMF! The one I marry hasta respect me as a man." It was<br/>a mistake to be talking about one's manhood and kicking a<br/>sign apart. "And, right now, *I* don't even respect me as<br/>a man: I need the cure." This last sign, she broke over<br/>the panda's head. "Or SOMETHING that'll let me forget<br/>what it feels like to be so..." There was a thesaurus of<br/>words to describe a woman; but Ranma had never been good<br/>with words, even when she became a girl, "DIFFERENT than<br/>a guy!"<p>A guy called, "Ranma! It is Ranma!"<p>A Yuka answered, "You're right, Hiroshi; it is Ranma!"<br/>Those two guys and two girls from Ranma's class were less<br/>than 10 meters away.<p>The dark-haired Caucasian girl with them asked in a<br/>strange accent, "What is-a Ranma doing out of the zoo? I<br/>thought-a pandas were an endanger species."<p>Daisuke mind was elsewhere, "Gee, I guess Ranma DOESN'T<br/>have any dresses or anything."<p>Sayuri said, "Before you ask about a panda wearing<br/>dresses, Leonora, Ranma is the girl with it."<p>The black-haired Leonora said, "Nice 'air color! Do you<br/>think-a she will tell me what-a she uses?"<p>Sayuri said, "You're not more interested in finding why<br/>she's with a panda? I am."<p>Hiroshi asked, "What's all that wood doing around you,<br/>Ranma?"<p>Daisuke said, "I thought pandas only ate bamboo."<p>Hiroshi asked, "Is busting up wood practice for some<br/>special martial arts technique, Ranma?"<p>Ranma-chan looked down and saw that not all of the words<br/>on the signs were obliterated. "Er, that's right!" she<br/>said, stomping the nearest boards into splinters.<p>Sayuri said with satisfaction, "And with her barefoot,<br/>too!" Ranma-chan had lost her slippers somewhere.<p>(Daisuke muttered, "That's just about the only part of<br/>her bare." Still, feet could be sexy, too.)<p>Leonora said, "I 'ave-a seen anime about-a martial<br/>artists, ah, but I never thought I would-a see a real<br/>LIVE one!"<p>Yuka noted, "The panda is knocking the wood into the<br/>canal. Doesn't it know that's littering?" It had been<br/>swiping pieces of the sign past the rail and down the<br/>levee.<p>Sayuri asked, "Now, about why you're with a panda-"<p>Kane-chan called, "Hiroshi! Daisuke! Everybody!"<p>Everybody turned to see a longhaired girl in a fancy,<br/>white dress jogging toward them.<p>Yuka asked, "Who is that?"<p>Hiroshi said, "That voice. I think I've heard that voice<br/>before."<p>Daisuke said, "What are you doing paying attention to<br/>girls' VOICES!" The white dress was too long. Calves<br/>weren't very sexy, but, on the other hand, dresses were<br/>always suggestive.<p>Sayuri said, "Look, maybe she's with the Tendou's." And<br/>she pointed, "There are Kaneda's dad and sister." And<br/>they were dressed in their best, Japanese-style clothes.<p>They watched as Kane-chan ran right past them.<p>Kane-chan was too late: Ranma-chan had used Kane-chan's<br/>distraction to make her escape. As for the panda:<p>Splash!<p>Kane-chan ran to the railing overlooking the canal.<br/>Quickly looking around, she picked up the last large<br/>piece of unbroken wood. Threatening to throw it, she<br/>yelled at the panda in the water, "Don't even THINK of<br/>coming back with your wet fur!"<p>The panda growled, but then waded away in the shallow<br/>water.<p>Leonora was confused, "Japanese are cruel to endanger<br/>species?...Japanese believe in 'aving a danger animal out<br/>of a cage?" Then she grinned, "Japan IS-a like their<br/>anime!"<p>Hiroshi came up to Kane-chan and asked, "Haven't we met<br/>before?"<p>Soun Tendou had come close enough to say, "Akane, we<br/>still haven't talked."<p>Kane-chan turned around to look at him and the others.<br/>The piece of sign she held in front of her read, [...kane<br/>is a GUY!]<p>Kasumi took her father by an arm and gently pulled him<br/>away from the young people, "You'll have your chance,<br/>Father. Akane will be visiting our home quite often, I<br/>assure you."<p>Daisuke moved in, "So: Your name is Akane, hunh?"<p>Sayuri read, and asked, "Somebody is a guy?"<p>Kane-chan realized what she was holding in front of her-<br/>and chucked the words into the canal. Kane-chan's escape<br/>wasn't going to be as easy as Ranma's. "Uh, who's THIS<br/>new girl? She's not from around here, is she?"<p>Yuka said, "This is the daughter of a business associate<br/>of my Daddums. She's from Florence, Italy."<p>Leonora said, "Before Yuka can give-a me any more of a<br/>grandioso introduction, my name is Leonora da Vinci."<p>Kane-chan thought she'd heard of her, "Oh? It's not<br/>Leonardo?"<p>Leonora laughed, "He's a Great-a great-relative of mine!"<p>Sayuri explained, "She's interested in the same things as<br/>he was, so we tried to show her the "Castle of Kuno"."<p>A little pouty, Yuka said, "Only they don't let tourists<br/>inside, even for international good-will!"<p>Hiroshi filled Akane in, "Besides being an artist,<br/>Leonardo da Vinci was an inventor. He would LOVE to see<br/>"The House of Gadgets" the Kuno place is supposed to be."<p>Daisuke added, "And not "Gadgets" like the Japanese are<br/>famous for nowadays: Gadgets as in deadly traps, and<br/>weapons that make sure unwanted guests DON'T check out<br/>more than the smallest fraction of its secrets."<p>Sayuri wrinkled her nose, "Boys!"<p>But Kane-chan was interested, "Gadgets! REALLY!"<br/>Maybe I could learn something I could add to my dojo's<br/>gimmicks.<p>Leonora giggled, "That's-a why Hiroshi and Daisuke were<br/>invited with us. Guys generally know more about-a science<br/>of war than girls."<p>(Sayuri said, "I prefer to watch the ART of unarmed<br/>combat.")<p>Yuka smiled, "Besides, they're boys!"<p>Hiroshi was less happy, "AND we're considered "safe"."<br/>He, Daisuke and Kaneda had reputations for being<br/>perverts, but also harmless ones. Of course, they weren't<br/>going to tell that to Akane. (Little did they suspect yet<br/>SHE was largely responsible for those reputations.)<p>Leonora asked, "We 'ave-a been wandering, and looking for<br/>some other Nerima land-a-mark of interest. What is over<br/>there?"<p>Kane-chan quickly got between them and the way to the<br/>Temple of the Nine Abilities, "There's nothing good in<br/>this direction! Have you visited the Zoo? The "Temple of<br/>the Wild Horse"? -I know: Lovers' Woods!"<p>Hiroshi cried, "Yes! Lovers' Woods! That's the perfect<br/>place to go!"<p>Leonora said, "'Ey, uno momento! We Italiani may speak a<br/>Romance language, but-"<p>Daisuke told her, "No, you don't understand: The Woods<br/>are haunted! It's better than taking your date to a<br/>haunted house!"<p>Sayuri told the idiots, "Like THAT'S going to help,<br/>either." She explained to Leonora, "There's an<br/>undeveloped wooded area behind the high school. The<br/>reason it stays that way in the middle of Greater Tokyo<br/>is because of the Phenomenon."<p>Yuri said, "The Phantom!" The strange word was close<br/>enough to "Phenomenon" for her.<p>Hiroshi said, "Where it is exactly keeps shifting around<br/>within the woods, even disappearing for a while. But when<br/>you find it, you can't stand up, sit, or lay down<br/>straight. It's a gravitational anomaly where up is almost<br/>down, and a right angle is 135 degrees. If anybody builds<br/>anything, it fails the building codes."<p>Leonora was very interested now, "If-a things like-a that<br/>'appen, why is it not-a famous?"<p>Yuri said, "The Phantom! You know what phantoms do."<p>Sayuri said, "Not because of a "phantom". It's<br/>because..."<p>Daisuke said, "Akane's gone now, too!"<p>Hiroshi got serious, "Next time, we're going to keep our<br/>eyes on those cute girls."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan was in no mood to test if the huge compound<br/>was really as much of a fortress as it looked. If it<br/>wasn't, she could've saved time going through it. She<br/>would've lost time, if it were. She decided there was no<br/>real reason why she had to save time. More important was<br/>not to draw unnecessary attention. The more of that she<br/>got, the more chances her secret would be found out. She<br/>should lay off getting into fights for a while.<p>She was standing on a two-story rooftop across from the<br/>compound. She looked at the thick, plastered stonewall<br/>with the clay tiles that formed a roof along its top. She<br/>said to herself, "If I'm gonna let my secret out, it's<br/>gonna be on my terms."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Despite the feeling of a corset, Ranma-chan learned a new<br/>route (by rooftop, walls, fences and rails) to the Tendou<br/>compound. But when she got there, she was too tired to<br/>leap over its more modest fortress walls. The gate was<br/>closed with a large, old padlock. "Maybe I will have to<br/>jump it." When she tested it, though, she found it hadn't<br/>locked.<p>The thing about houses with fusuma/paper doors, it is<br/>always easy for anybody to break in. The Tendous had<br/>large ones that opened onto their garden. They cost money<br/>to replace. That was why Ranma expected and found the<br/>front door open.<p>She went straight for the hot water in the bathroom.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki checked in the bathroom. "Well, Ranma's been here.<br/>She had followed Ranma-chan's dirty barefoot prints to<br/>there. And the girl hadn't cleaned them before she went<br/>into the furo. There was still some grime on them when he<br/>got out and left a few guy-sized prints." She<br/>congratulated herself on her detective skill. "Now that I<br/>know he's here, all I have to do is find where he is."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-kun was in a lotus position upside down, resting<br/>his weight on his forearms: For the fourth time that<br/>afternoon. "Aaarrr!" he cried, rolling forward onto his<br/>butt, his ankles still on his thighs. "It's no good!" He<br/>looked down at his stomach, "This invisible corset is<br/>drivin' me crazy! I'm a guy, but I feel like I STILL got<br/>the girl's middle!" He pulled up his shirt and looked at<br/>his waist, for the tenth time. "I can see my abs and<br/>sides come in. If it wasn't for my bigger muscles and<br/>lower fat, it COULD be the girl's waist!" Disgusted, he<br/>shoved the shirt back down; "Not that I took the time to<br/>study anything of that other body." As far as he was<br/>concerned the best way of dealing with becoming a girl<br/>was to ignore as much of it as he could.<p>He sat lotus like with his head bent over as he rubbed<br/>the back of his neck and shoulders with his hands. "What<br/>to do! This is just another challenge. All I gotta do<br/>is figure out how to deal with it."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki waited in the threshold of the open Tendou<br/>fortress gate. She idly fanned herself with the long,<br/>Japanese-style envelope she held in her hand. Finally her<br/>patience was rewarded.<p>She ducked into the front courtyard, and then through the<br/>gate that led to the dojo.<p>When she got there, she saw Ranma-kun still in the lotus<br/>he was in the last time she'd seen him; only now his back<br/>was on the floor. The top of his head was pointed towards<br/>the door, so she just had to walk up to him. He looked up<br/>at the envelope she lowered before his eyes. [To Kei<br/>Tendou]<p>Nabiki presented the envelope, "Here!"<p>Ranma-kun asked, "What is it?" He had managed to find<br/>some meditative peace.<p>Nabiki answered, "It's from Kuno."<p>Ranma said, "Him, again?"<p>Nabiki, enjoying the unfolding plot, informed him, "It's<br/>for your MALE half, Kei Tendou."<p>Ranma-kun frowned, "My MALE "half" is named Ranma<br/>Saotome."<p>Nabiki said, "Yeah, yeah: The same as your GIRL half.<br/>Don't tell me, tell Kuno." She smirked, "But if you do,<br/>he'll always know where to find his "Pig-tailed Venus".<br/>Anybody have any water?"<p>Ranma-kun got a thoroughly disgusted grimace. Maybe there<br/>WAS something to be said about having a secret identity.<p>Meanwhile, Kaneda in his school uniform had heard<br/>everything from just outside the dojo door. He had<br/>followed Nabiki from the gate, wondering what she was up<br/>to now.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma cried out loud as he leaped out of the way of a<br/>sudden blast of steam just in time.<p>Across the street from where he'd landed, the oblivious<br/>man and his machine that was steam cleaning the grim off<br/>of one of the many concrete buildings in this area of<br/>town. Ranma-kun said, "MAN! What am I gettin' jumpy<br/>about! That wasn't COLD water!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-kun reached the address given in Kuno's letter.<br/>Whether it was a challenge, Ranma wasn't sure. Kuno's<br/>elegant calligraphy had left out a lot of the fancy kanji<br/>he probably preferred and stuck with basic elementary-<br/>school hiragana. He had even toned down the ornate<br/>samurai dialect. (All of which meant Kuno was treating<br/>Ranma-kun like a semi-illiterate peasant, implying Ranma-<br/>kun was a simpleton, too.) Even so, Kuno had a way of<br/>making any declaration sound like a challenge. Ranma-kun<br/>reminded himself about keeping a low profile for a while.<p>Kuno was waiting in the in front of a modern, six-story<br/>condo. Ranma-kun had to wonder why the samurai had chosen<br/>this place of all places, beyond the fact that he<br/>probably owned it. The martial artist thought it wasn't a<br/>typical place for a fight. The paved plaza around the<br/>block-long building was open. The only place outside an<br/>accomplice could be hiding was around the corner of the<br/>building.<p>Then again, Kuno WAS waiting near the corner. The front<br/>doors were at the corner, too. They were all glass;<br/>Ranma-kun could see that there was nobody in the lobby.<br/>But that only meant any henchman inside would not be in<br/>the first assault wave. THEN there were the balconies<br/>above.<p>Whatever the guy's tactics were he was facing in the<br/>wrong direction. If it were samurai arrogance, Kuno<br/>spoiled the effect by turning around before Ranma-kun was<br/>within striking distance. Then again, Kuno had written<br/>the letter, and HE wanted to set the agenda,<br/>"Salutations, Saotome." (Also spoiling it was the blond<br/>doll in the long pink dress and white frilly apron he<br/>carried in his arm.)<p>Ranma-kun matched Kuno's superior samurai attitude with<br/>peasant casualness, "NOW what is it, Kuno. What'd you<br/>call me out here for?"<p>Kuno said seriously, "You will address me as Lord Kuno."<p>Ranma-kun said to "Kuno-sama", "Yeah, WHATEVER. What-"<br/>Then it registered, "What did you call me?"<p>Kuno said, "I gave you no slight, NOR honorific. Until I<br/>know where we stand, I give you no form of address. I<br/>merely call you Saotome."<p>Puzzled, Ranma-kun looked down at his normal, male body,<br/>"Weren't you told my name was Tendou?"<p>Kuno said, "That I was. But Nabiki Tendou has told me the<br/>truth."<p>Ranma-kun became worried now, "She did! How much did<br/>she tell you?"<p>Kuno said, "She told me the whole, tragic tale."<p>Ranma-kun cried, "She had no RIGHT to do that!"<p>Kuno said, "Fear, not, Saotome. For the proper<br/>incentives, LORD Kuno can provide the patronage you need<br/>to obtain what has been taken from you."<p>Ranma-kun didn't believe him, "How? The only way I can<br/>think of getting my cure is-" He sucked in his breath,<br/>"China! You'd loan me the money to get back there?" Now<br/>that Ranma had that thought, he'd have to struggle with<br/>how much foot kissing he could stand. (Anything higher,<br/>and he'd kick it before he'd kiss it.)<p>Frowning, Kuno was now puzzled, "China? How Japanese are<br/>you? I thought your clan was from Fukuoka."<p>Ranma-kun joined in, " "Fukuoka"? Where-" Nabiki! "O-OH!<br/>THAT tale." She HAD said something about Fukuoka to the<br/>Two Fathers. That was why they couldn't make Kaneda marry<br/>herself. Then he told him quite firmly, "I'm a hundred<br/>percent JAPANESE, Kuno. Don't you forget it!" He didn't<br/>need the samurai idiot questioning his patriotism on top<br/>of everything else. It was bad enough he was forced to<br/>wear Chinese clothes.<p>Kuno was suspicious, "Then what does China have to do<br/>with your problem, Saotome?"<p>Ranma-kun had no ideas, but he knew that "China has a<br/>longer history of martial arts than Japan." THAT'S how<br/>Ranma's most recent curse began! Stupid Old Man! He'd<br/>run out of places in Japan to steal techniques from; he<br/>HAD to go to countries where you couldn't even understand<br/>they might be in trouble BEFORE they got into it!<p>Kuno's frown became scornful, "Humph! "Martial Arts"." As<br/>far as he was concerned the only skills deserving of that<br/>term were those taught to the samurai warriors of old;<br/>ways that were all but unique in the world. He didn't<br/>even respect the impure Chinese warrior-class. "You wish<br/>to go to China? No doubt, you have kin in China bowing<br/>before foreign teachers."<p>Ranma-kun decided he couldn't kiss this jerk's feet.<br/>"Okay, we've established you're not gonna send me to<br/>China. Now tell me what you called me here for."<p>Kuno tossed the cute, blond doll, "This!" Ranma-kun<br/>caught the thing. At least it wasn't booby-trapped. (At<br/>least that, like using ninja assassins, didn't look to be<br/>the samurai's style.)<p>Ranma-kun asked, "What is "this"?"<p>Kuno told him sarcastically, "It's a cute dolly."<p>So much for respecting him; Ranma-kun answered, "I know<br/>that, you jerk! What's it for?"<p>Kuno told him, "It is for Akane. For my advocacy of your<br/>cause to the nobility of Fukuoka, I merely require you to<br/>give up your claim to her hand." Fukuoka nobility? Ranma<br/>wasn't about to ask this idiot what that meant.<p>Ranma-kun tossed it back to Kuno; "Forget it. As much as<br/>I'd like to get rid of her, I can't. As long as I have<br/>her, I don't have to worry about the other fiancees<br/>waitin' to take her place."<p>Kuno cried, " "O, other, fi-ancees"! You have more than<br/>ONE fiancée!"<p>Ranma-kun pushed past him, "GEEZ! I hope not." Not after<br/>the fiancée fiasco that happened LAST year. "But I'll<br/>tell you what. You can DATE her all you want."<p>Kuno squeezed the doll in his hand; he said with<br/>indignation, "You unspeakable CAD, you! You ADMIT that<br/>you are merely using poor, benighted Akane for your own<br/>ends! You have no intention to... Did you say I can,<br/>DATE her?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Well, sure! I as heck don't plan on<br/>goin' on any. And as for 'Akane', I doubt she'd WANT me<br/>to, lookin' like I do now." Not that she'd want to go out<br/>with this GUY any better. Ranma was in no danger of<br/>losing his anti-marriage insurance.<p>Still slightly confused, Kuno said, "THAT I can well<br/>understand. You ARE lacking in sartorial je ne sais quoi,<br/>as well as mannerly panache, my uncouth peasant."<p>Ranma-kun turned the corner, "Yeah, yeah. You've got all<br/>that-" He bumped into a rack of clothes. It was the kind<br/>on wheels he'd seen in garment districts and the like,<br/>and he'd actually managed to nearly knock it over.<br/>Keeping them from falling, "Wow! Some woman's-" he<br/>corrected himself when he saw three Furinkan girls'<br/>uniforms, and one fuku that was a brown skirt and a white<br/>middy with a brown sailor collar and red sailor scarf,<br/>"Some GIRL'S a real clothes horse in this place."<p>Kuno was reminded, "That is the other matter I wished to<br/>bring up with you, Kei Saotome."<p>Ranma-kun told him, "My name ain't "Kei" Saotome."<br/>Another step towards dealing with what had happened to<br/>him.<p>Kuno said, "As you wish. I can understand how you would<br/>take a vow to foreswear your proper appellation until you<br/>can savor it as victory when your true birth name is<br/>awarded you."<p>Not sure exactly sure what was just said, Ranma said, "If<br/>you say so." With the crowded clothes rack back up, Ranma<br/>eyed it briefly before having to listen to the idiot<br/>again. Besides the school uniforms, it had a wide of<br/>assortment of the kind of clothes girly girls were<br/>expected to wear. (There were street dresses, a few<br/>skirts and blouses, a tennis outfit, a sundress, a<br/>yukata, a couple of gowns, and a frou-frou dress-<br/>something; there was even a shelf underneath them with<br/>shoes and boxes with things inside Ranma didn't want to<br/>think about.) The thought of them made his stomach<br/>tighten even more under the corset.<p>Kuno informed him, "I had the town's only haute couture<br/>boutique send over an assortment. Money was no object,<br/>but time was."<p>Ranma-kun eyed the taller guy; "They're yours?" What is<br/>he, some cross-dresser? THAT thought made his stomach<br/>feel like doing worse than just turn.<p>Kuno said, "Only until such time as they meet with your<br/>approval, Tendou nee Saotome."<p>Ranma-kun raised his voice, "MY approval! What'd you<br/>need MY approval for! You don't think I'm gonna WEAR<br/>any of that, that-STUFF!"<p>Kuno's face was screwed in a grimace; "Of course not! I<br/>have thought many ill things of you, Kei Tendou, but<br/>CROSS-DRESSING hadn't been one of them. Can you REALLY<br/>fit into a petit size?"<p>Ranma-kun, now, did yell, "How should *I* know! I don't<br/>know anything about how stretchable modern fabrics are!<br/>- What am I sayin'! *I* don't wear girls' ANY things!"<p>Kuno's grimace eased, "Then you are the man to pass them<br/>on to the lady I bought them for."<p>Ranma-kun was still loud, "Akane? SURE! She'd LOVE more<br/>girly clothes!" Ranma-kun said it with sarcasm to make<br/>himself feel better.<p>Kuno heard something different. For the sake of his<br/>objectives, he had laid his opinion of the Tendous aside.<br/>He had not seen Akane lately in the dresses Kasumi was<br/>putting in Kaneda's magic tool chest. He still thought<br/>the Saotome women were being forced to endure unfeminine<br/>roles. To Kuno, the mockery was a confirmation of his<br/>fears about where the Tendou men got their extraordinary<br/>prowess, namely by destroying reputations. They used the<br/>sheer perverse thrill they got from it to tap into their<br/>chi. That would make it a base, infernal martial arts<br/>technique. Or they ACTUALLY consumed reputations. That<br/>would make Kaneda and Kei in league with evil spirits.<p>Kuno began to see where his thinking had gone astray,<br/>"No, not the Wild Haired Huntress, Akane." Nabiki hadn't<br/>told him to buy clothes for Akane. "Though I would not<br/>mind providing a wardrobe that matched this one in<br/>substance and generosity. After all, I cannot allow any<br/>misunderstanding of favoritism to creep into my bi-<br/>fractured relationships. Yes: I WILL call the boutique<br/>and have them deliver-"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Later, Kuno, alright? Just TELL me<br/>already how do I come in, if this poodle-dog fluff ain't<br/>for Akane?"<p>Kuno drew himself up and said with all samurai dignity,<br/>"As I displayed my superior honorableness by approaching<br/>Akane through you, her fiance, I now do the same by<br/>asking you to intercede with your erstwhile kinfolk on my<br/>behalf. I wish them to condone my dating your cousin, the<br/>pig-tailed beauty, Ranma Saotome."<p>Ranma cried, "WHAT! Date you! You're out of your<br/>stupid mind, if you think I'm gonna allow that!"<p>Kuno yelled back, "You are willing to let me date with<br/>your fiance, but not your cousin!"<p>Ranma-kun told him, "That's right! Akane means nothing to<br/>me: RANMA is FAR more important!"<p>Kuno cried, "FA-AR more important! Just HOW close a<br/>cousin is Ranma to you! Perhaps you would treat her as<br/>something OTHER than hallowed kin!"<p>Ranma-kun walked away, "You've got that right. And to<br/>you, PAL, Ranma's gonna be so off limits you'll never see<br/>her again, if *I* have anything to say about it."<p>Kuno clenched his fist and lowered eyes in righteous<br/>fury, "THAT is why you treat poor, feral Akane so<br/>shamefully! You have captured her spirit, giving her no<br/>avenue out of your maze of deceit. NOW, you would do the<br/>same with fiery Ranma!"<p>Ranma-kun stopped, sensing danger. A stainless steel<br/>washtub crashed to the pavement in front of him from a<br/>condo apartment above. It landed on a damp splatter where<br/>water had come down not long ago.<p>Nabiki appeared from behind the short hedge planted along<br/>the side of the condo's plaza; "I guess you can't always<br/>trust the curse to get the timing right." She used a<br/>spray bottle to get Ranma wet. "Then again, you two were<br/>talking so long, the curse probably got tired of<br/>waiting."<p>Kuno broke out of his monolog: "Nnn, NEVER! *I*, Lord<br/>Tatewaki Kuno, will personally save the world from the<br/>Tendous! I would spend ALL of my own and my family's<br/>immense reputation to save the Saotomes! I will live to<br/>see-" He spun the now much shorter Kei Tendou around. He<br/>was amazed to notice the red haired "Ranma Saotome!"<p>Kuno's attack mode took a moment to shift gears; "My<br/>love! My Pig-tailed Venus!" He reached to pull her small<br/>body to his manly one, "How I've longed-"<p>Ranma-chan punched him hard enough in the face to break<br/>any normal person's nose.<p>Absorbing the blow, Kuno quickly did a counter-move; he<br/>hugged her tightly to his bosom. "I shall never let you<br/>go again!"<p>Nabiki had planned for this as well; using towels to hold<br/>the family teakettle, she poured its contents over Ranma.<p>Ranma screamed and flailed her arms, "YE-OWW,W!"<p>Nabiki 'apologized', "I'm sorry, Ranma: Was that too<br/>hot?"<p>Kuno was slow to realize, "Ranma, you said?"<p>Ranma-kun got loose from the now weakened embrace, and<br/>brought his foot up to meet the guy's face. (Still no<br/>broken nose!) "How long do you plan on holdin' me, PAL!"<p>Ranma-kun replanted his foot, and made ready to leave by<br/>the concrete stairs to the lower tier of the condo's<br/>plaza. "Do you get it now? My secret." So much for the<br/>jerk not knowing where "his Pig-tailed Venus" could be<br/>found. Puke!<p>Kuno watched Kei descend. "I shall not call you Saotome<br/>again. You do not deserve to share the same name as my<br/>two faultless loves. For you have learned the ways of the<br/>Tendous too well: You have become a practitioner of their<br/>black magic."<p>In his sudden stop, Ranma-kun almost stumbled down the<br/>stairs, "Argh!"<p>Kuno challenged him, "Where have you hidden my goddess,<br/>Ranma? Do not try to fool ME with your petty trickery,<br/>Evil One!"<p>Ranma-kun couldn't believe what this dangerous whacko was<br/>saying; he attempted a smile, "Oh, come on! It's not like<br/>that!"<p>Nabiki knew Kuno had gone off into his world of Japanese<br/>legends-and-folklore (with, no doubt, some European<br/>myths-and-tales thrown in out of his confusion). She<br/>could make use of Kuno-baby's delusions. But, first,<br/>there were her plans for Ranma. For those, she needed<br/>Kuno to back off, and RANMA to think she could be on his<br/>side. "Hmm! Looks like we're going to have to spell<br/>everything out for him." She took her finger away from<br/>her lips, and motioned, "Come here, Kuno-baby." When he<br/>did come, she told him, "Here's thing. You know that girl<br/>you like?" She couldn't resist the temptation to be<br/>melodramatic (and ambiguous). "Well, her body and, soul,<br/>BOTH belong to Kei." Why be any clearer? If the two heard<br/>her the way she wanted them each to, her options would be<br/>kept open. "And you know what THAT means?"<p>Whunkle! A second stainless steel washtub fell on Kuno's<br/>head.<p>The newlywed husband said from above, "Be careful! Now<br/>you've dropped the one my mother gave us!"<p>His wife answered, "Why do we need things like that in a<br/>modern condo, anyway? Is our budget THAT tight we can't<br/>use the Laundromat!"<p>As the lovebirds started yet another round of<br/>communication up above, Kuno was struggling with the idea<br/>of, "Her, body...and her, soul!..." It was as evil as<br/>he'd thought. It was as intolerable as he thought: He<br/>tossed the washtub from his head for the, "Svengali! "<p>Ranma-kun jumped over it, and backwards to the lower<br/>plaza. Landing, he pointed, "Ghugh! Kuno! How STUPID can<br/>you be!"<p>Kuno ran up to the low hedge, "Silence, wretch! I can see<br/>all too well what your evil has done!" He ducked down out<br/>of sight.<p>Up came the cute, little dolly, followed by Kuno. (Nabiki<br/>was standing there where she could see all of Kuno. She<br/>wondered where the toy had come from all of a sudden. Did<br/>he have the same way with dolls as Kaneda had with<br/>mallets?) Using the hedge as a puppet stage, Kuno did the<br/>voices, " "Hello, there, Pig-tailed girl"." And he gave a<br/>"Punch" slap to its face. The "Judy" cried, "Eee." The<br/>lecher voice said, "Hey! Just be quiet and do as you're<br/>told!" The blue-eyed imitation girl answered, "Ye, ye,<br/>yes, Master!" The evil master said, "Here I come," and<br/>pulled his plaything down out of sight. It pleaded, "Oh,<br/>me! Oh, oh: Mother!"<p>A flower was plucked and tossed up on the hedge top. A<br/>cold, sick shiver went through Ranma-kun.<p>Nabiki clapped. Ranma was not amused.<p>It was Kuno not his depiction of Kei that returned,<br/>sobbing, "Oh-ow! It's so terrible."<p>Ranma-kun told him, "Leave me outa your sick fantasies,<br/>pal!"<p>Kuno rose, "SILENCE, you enslaver of women!" And he<br/>leaped over the hedge, his hard wooden sword now in his<br/>hand. He landed slashing.<p>Ranma-kun leaned this way and that, avoiding each wind-<br/>cutting blow.<p>Kane-chan watched from one of the stele-like posts that<br/>flanked this street's official entrance to the condo's<br/>plaza. She had not been as lucky as Ranma in avoiding the<br/>steam that was cleaning the building a couple of blocks<br/>down. As soon as she changed into a girl, she had<br/>discovered that Kasumi had returned home; she had<br/>replaced the more formal white dress for the pink jumper<br/>and white dress she had Kane-chan in yesterday.<p>Kuno told Kei, "I shall SMITE thee, then I shall rescue<br/>Ranma Saotome!"<p>Ranma-kun answered, "Oh, I get it: If you lose, you'll<br/>forget all about her, right!" And he grabbed the top of<br/>Kuno's bokken, using it to vault his legs up. Both feet<br/>struck Kuno solidly in the chest.<p>As Kuno recoiled to absorb the blow, small squares came<br/>out of his kendo-gi's sternum-baring coat.<p>Ranma-kun caught the glint of gloss-and-color from one of<br/>those square fluttering down. He took it and looked.<p>It was a photo of HIM! SHE was taking off her wet<br/>undershirt! There was a flash of one of her boobs. But<br/>the camera was at an angle where the only one with a good<br/>view of them was Mr. Tendou. (He must've gotten a good<br/>peek; he was spewing milk.)<p>Kuno saw the opportunity distractions brought: His battle<br/>cry was "Fortune smiles!" as he smote the pervert caught<br/>by his own impurity.<p>Ranma-kun was hit in a 'corset' rib. It's force caused<br/>him to stumble away. But he refused to fall. He recovered<br/>enough to continue to dodge the samurai's sword.<p>The bokken created enough of the wind to blow five more<br/>of the photos within Ranma's grasp. They weren't all of<br/>him as a girl. There were some of Kaneda as an uncute<br/>tomboy. HEY! These are-"<p>Though Kei had more cause to be distracted, his skills<br/>now allowed him to easily keep the sword from touching<br/>him. A somewhat winded Kuno cried, "You insult me with<br/>your inattention! I shall teach you not to take Tatewaki<br/>Kuno so lightly!" This time the samurai thrust the point<br/>of his weapon forward with all of his speed.<p>Ranma-kun tumbled backward. He HAD been distracted. His<br/>momentum carried his tumble meters away.<p>It carried him straight to the feet of some girl. But it<br/>wasn't just some girl; "Hello. Akane!" Akane? All that<br/>talk of Akane must have stuck in Ranma's mind. Well, it<br/>WAS better than thinking of himself being engaged to a<br/>"Kaneda".<p>Kane-chan frowned down on him, "EXCUSE me, but I think<br/>there's something you ought to know. When Kuno gets<br/>really mad about something he's REALLY hard to beat.<br/>You'd better start paying attention to what you're doing<br/>or he's going to make you regret it."<p>Ranma-kun noticed that Nabiki was coming. He answered<br/>'Akane' with, "And there's something I think you ought to<br/>know. You're still wearing those polka-dotted panties and<br/>they still don't suit you, even from this angle."<p>He HAD to remind Kane-chan she was wearing girls'<br/>underwear! It was bad enough being stuck into a dress:<br/>"Say things like that when YOU'RE wearing them!" Ranma<br/>was so low she couldn't attack him with any of the<br/>standard Tendou techniques. "Tendou Upper Body Whip-<br/>Crack, REVISED: Tendou LOWER Body Whip-Crack!"<p>KICK!<p>It, it worked! Ranma-kun was sent flying up into the air.<p>Ranma-kun landed almost where his tumble had begun.<p>And he was smiling: Obviously Kane-chan would have to<br/>work on perfecting the technique she'd just came up with.<p>Kuno was smiling, too, "At last this game ends!" And he<br/>chuckled confidently.<p>He attacked! HAD he found Ranma's weak point: He was<br/>attacking with stab after rapid stab of the point of his<br/>bokken. What was one looked to the untrained eye like ten<br/>swords! Ranma-kun had to really work to avoid the<br/>advancing wall of jabbing spikes. He was forced to<br/>backtrack as he looked for an opening in the offense.<p>The stele-like post beside Kane-chan suddenly developed<br/>deep cracks.<p>Nabiki said, "Whoa! From just the air pressure alone!"<p>Pieces shattered off of the post. Kane-chan gasped in<br/>surprise.<p>Ranma-kun saw that Akane had barely moved away from it OR<br/>the way he was being backed into. He was going down! "Out<br/>of the way stupid!"<p>Kuno at last raised his sword for the final slash, "I<br/>have you!"<p>Kane-chan cried, "Look NOW! The opening!"<p>Ranma had hoped something like that would happen when he<br/>went down. In a handstand, he brought one leg up. From<br/>lower abdomen to face, it was one fluid motion to the<br/>untrained eye. They wouldn't even be certain if Ranma-kun<br/>had struck ANY blow at all.<p>Ranma-kun somersaulted away using just that one hand, to<br/>land meters away. The scion of samurai was still<br/>standing, though, his sword still poised.<p>Kane-chan sucked in her breath. DID I see what I thought<br/>I saw? Or was it just wishful thinking! Damn! I wish<br/>my senses were better trained!<p>Nabiki was even more uncertain, "HUNH?"<p>Ranma-kun said with a slight smirk, "It's all<br/>over...Kuno."<p>Kuno lowered his bokken. "You will address me as Lor,<br/>Lord..." He collapsed face forward onto the pavement.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Meanwhile, a Mercedes-Benz had pulled up to a stop not<br/>too far down the block. The man who got out of it had<br/>already been following the fight. His punch-perm hair,<br/>overly expensive suit, and hint of tattoos around the<br/>cuffs suggested that if he wasn't a stereotypical member<br/>of the Yakuza/Japanese mafia, he wanted others to think<br/>he was.<p>The End of this chapter
