</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>[Note: This story is on the anime's timeline.]<p>05: The Tendou Trick<p>A scratched and tattered Kuno stood there for a moment with tree<br/>branches sticking out of his kendo-gi. He was trying to<br/>understand what had just happened, "T, Te, Tendou! His, his<br/>name is, TEN,DOU!"<p>His bookbag on his back, Ranma-kun protested, "My name is-"<p>Kane-chan put her hands up against his mouth; in her best 'girl'<br/>voice, she said, "I just HAD to tell him. I'm SO sorry. I know<br/>we promised to keep our real names a<br/>SECRET."<p>She frowned into his eyes, trying to get her message through to<br/>him. Her voice hardened, "We DO want to keep our secret, don't<br/>we?"<p>In answer, Ranma-kun dropped the girl in the boys' uniform. She<br/>landed on her feet, her hands still over his mouth. She asked,<br/>"Well?" taking the risk of taking her hands off.<p>Ranma-kun asked, his voice slowed by him controlling his anger,<br/>"And how is me bein' a Kei Tendou gonna help keep a secret?"<p>The black haired girl relaxed a little, "Two names implies TWO<br/>people."<p>Ranma-kun had thought of that before. But as a martial artist,<br/>his name was important. He didn't WANT people to know he became<br/>a girl. But he did want his opponents to know Ranma Saotome beat<br/>them. It was a dilemma he hadn't settled to his satisfaction<br/>yet. Now this guy girl wanted to settle it for him! Ranma-kun<br/>grumbled, "But why Kei Tendou?" And shouldn't it be the girl<br/>that had the different name?<p>That was when Kuno attacked, "Nay, I say! One scourge of<br/>Furinkan is too many!"<p>Ranma moved the girl around out of the way. He said to the guy<br/>with the raised sword, "Hah! A fight I can deal with!"<p>Kane-chan looked on a little amazed. "He's not fighting under<br/>the her own name... Nabiki's plan is better than I thought."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It has started on that first night, when they'd discovered the<br/>truth about Ranma AND Kaneda. Nabiki had told Kasumi "Akane<br/>Saotome" would be staying with her.<br/>But when it came time for Kane-chan to go to Kaneda's room,<br/>Nabiki had redirected her.<p>Sitting Kane-chan down, Nabiki said, "We have to talk.<br/>You WERE serious when you volunteered to be Ranma's<br/>fiancee?" Before Kane-chan could interrupt, she held up her<br/>hand, "I didn't say marriage. That's a step or two down the<br/>line."<p>Kane-chan made no move. She was still overwhelmed by all that<br/>had just happened. Despite finding out she was really a girl,<br/>Kane-chan could not yet imagine marrying 'another' guy. Just<br/>thinking the cute redhead could disappear into a guy irritated<br/>her no end. And as a guy, Ranma-kun brought out her natural<br/>antipathy towards 'other' guys. And there was something about<br/>the person, whether guy or girl, that got on her nerves.<p>And yet...<p>Nabiki said, "I'll take that as a yes. Look, *I* don't want to<br/>get stuck with the guy. He won't even be able to afford the<br/>inheritance tax, the marriage tax, and ALL the other taxes<br/>that's be dropped on a Japanese couple, let alone the life-style<br/>I'd like to become accustomed to."<p>Kane-chan'd forgotten about all the taxes waiting for them.<br/>Ranma'd be an asset. She's such a great martial artist her<br/>reputation would bring people into the dojo to learn from a<br/>master like her. The women would come thinking, "If a cute<br/>little thing like that can do it, so can I". While the guys<br/>would... Suddenly Kane-chan became angry at the thought of<br/>other guys ogling Ranma-chan, even in her loose martial arts<br/>uniform.<p>Nabiki continued with HER logic, "That means without you, KASUMI<br/>is the one left to fulfill dad's promise."<p>Kane-chan blurted out, "Kasumi engaged to a girl?" Kane-chan<br/>saw, that her guy-issues with Ranma were on the surface. She<br/>could not fundamentally accept Ranma as a guy. She had a far<br/>better chance accepting HERSELF was really a girl. Little did<br/>she know she had received the "Juusenkyo Blow to the Soul". It<br/>had fixed Ranma's girl-image in her mind, just as it had done to<br/>Kuno. The two would do mental contortions rather than admit they<br/>were stuck on a guy.<p>Nabiki gave herself a congratulatory smile at Kane-chan's<br/>response, and said, "Kasumi WOULDN'T become engaged to a girl."<br/>Then, playing to Kane-chan's male feelings, "NOR would any<br/>normal girl. Therefore, we must make sure Ranma is thought of as<br/>a girl. And it all begins by making the guy somebody else<br/>BESIDES Ranma."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan hadn't understood Nabiki's reasoning, it just seemed<br/>too complicated. She had put it aside. But when the great idiot<br/>Kuno showed an interest in Ranma-chan, she knew she had to do<br/>SOMETHING. Okay, it kept Ranma a girl to Kuno, but Nabiki's was<br/>the only plan Kane-chan had! But if it worked, Ranma would be a<br/>girl to more than just Kuno. And Kuno would help by spreading<br/>the word about "Kei Tendou".<p>Each slash of his bokken at Ranma-kun was an accent on Kuno's<br/>words, "I am the undefeated captain of this school's kendo club:<br/>The raising new star of the high school fencing world. The sound<br/>of my voice strikes fear into the hearts of my enemies. My peers<br/>call me the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High! Tatewaki Kuno, age<br/>17."<p>Only Ranma-kun paid much attention to the fallen athletes they<br/>were stepping on in the midst of their battle.<p>Ranma-kun was on the defensive only because he hadn't decided<br/>WHO was going to respond to the challenge, "Well,<br/>I'm uh... Well, I'm um, I'm uh, um, I'm stayin' at-"<p>It was time for Kane-chan to step in between the two, "I<br/>challenged you first, Kuno!"<p>Ranma-kun spoke up, "*I* have first claim: Me, Ran-"<p>Kuno hadn't bothered to wait to be interrupted, "The intruder is<br/>correct, my lady. A fight between men always takes precedent<br/>over a woman."<p>Kuno was correct, but that did not ease Kane-chan's indignation.<br/>I have enough memories as a girl to know how being patronized<br/>feels. Not that she wanted her feelings eased at the moment:<br/>"Oh! Is that so! Then you say you'd rather fight Kei Tendou<br/>than Ranma Saotome?"<p>Kuno answered, "Ranma Saotome is a girl."<p>Ranma-kun cried, "Now, just a minute there! Ranma Saotome AIN'T<br/>a girl!"<p>Kane-chan said, "Ranma certainly doesn't ACT like a girl."<p>Kuno said with a look of contempt, "That is because the infamous<br/>reveler in the perverse, Kaneda Tendou, gets his sick thrills<br/>denying Ranma her femininity!"<p>Ranma-kun cried, "The only one denyin' my femininity around here<br/>is me!"<p>Kuno turned his contempt on him, "So like a Tendou! Insecure in<br/>your masculinity, you chase women beyond the limits of what is<br/>morally, socially acceptable." Kuno pointed his sword at Kane-<br/>chan, "THEN when one succumbs to your guile and traps you by<br/>your own empty promise of betrothal," his sword moved from her<br/>neck to her feet, "you have her dress in male clothes so that<br/>your next prey will not be warned off by the sight of THIS<br/>victim!"<p>Kane-chan looked down at the white shirt and, past her bust, the<br/>gray slacks she was wearing, "The idiot makes sense. If he were<br/>a lecher like Ataru Moroboshi, how much luck could I have being<br/>followed by a girl in a dress?" She then thought of what the<br/>character had to go through, "...Let alone in a tiger-striped<br/>bikini."<p>Kuno asked in befuddlement, " "Tiger-striped bikini"?"<p>Kane-chan answered without thinking, "Yes, that's what<br/>his live-in wears when not in human clothes."<p>Kuno exclaimed, "Human clothes! Live-in!" His voice became<br/>mournful, "Oh, not even to be allowed the dignity of the first<br/>person."<p>Kane-chan asked, "What's gotten into you head now, Kuno!"<p>Kuno's voice then became low and threatening, "The vengeance of<br/>Heaven is slow, but sure. Making her a cross-dresser isn't<br/>enough, you ALSO force her to go about nearly unclothed, eh? I<br/>Tatewaki Kuno shall bring you to justice."<p>Ranma-kun cried, "Forcin'! I'M not the one donin' any<br/>forcin'!"<p>"Silence, Fool!" Kuno yelled, charging with is bokken.<p>Kuno put all of his righteous anger into the blow. But Ranma<br/>leaped over the latest in generations of samurai. Kuno's strike<br/>tore into the foot-thick concrete wall, creating a cleft that<br/>reached down to his knees.<p>Ranma-kun landed up on the rungs of a nearby concrete power<br/>pole.<br/>Kuno turned his sword on that.<p>His sword broke deep into it.<p>Ranma jumped off of the pole as it fell.<p>Kuno said, "Why you slippery, little..."<p>Ranma answered, "Hey, you hold on a second!" He rushed the<br/>taller guy in the kendo-gi; he got within an arm's reach of Kuno.<br/>The sword barely missing his moving head Ranma-kun told<br/>him, "Let me make one thing perfectly clear!" Ranma was<br/>on the attack now; in Kuno's face, Ranma-kun forced him to<br/>retreat, "You've got the wrong idea about me and Akane!"<p>(Again Kane-chan was impressed, "Wow, he's fast: He was there<br/>before Kuno could blink! No wonder he can create enough friction<br/>to heat water!")<p>Kuno finally found room to slash out with his sword again and<br/>again. Ranma-kun merely leaned back and moved his head aside<br/>again. "Akane means nothing to me!" Like pronouns and nouns,<br/>he found that he automatically matched the female-form to the<br/>female-form. He had conditioned himself to do this on his long<br/>trip back from China. The reflex extended to another cursed<br/>person.<p>Kuno paused to reassess his opponent, He's good. He saw his<br/>chance: "Hyah!"<p>Centimeters from him, Ranma-kun did a flying back flip and<br/>landed halfway between him and Kane-chan. Ranma-kun pointed at<br/>her and said, "If you want a violent chick like her who's too<br/>crazy to know how to be a girl, you can have her!" He was<br/>serious. On top of everything else she'd done to him since he'd<br/>met her, she'd done some desperate things yesterday when he was<br/>trying to test his "Saotome Hot Water Attack". It would've<br/>maimed a lesser guy.<p>(Kane-chan got mad, "Rrrmm!")<p>Kuno said, "It is obvious as the day follows the night, your<br/>words carry no substance. I will not let you talk that way about<br/>Akane!" And he charged again with his sword.<p>Kane-chan screamed, "Who are YOU to call me a violent chick!"<br/>With nothing but the schoolbag at hand, she threw it at Ranma-<br/>kun.<p>Ranma leaped high, high above as Kuno's sword cleaved the<br/>leather bag in half.<p>Everything seemed to be in stop motion as Kuno fixed his eyes on<br/>the other guy, waiting for him to down close enough for him to-<p>Kane-chan slammed into Kuno, knocking him over with her<br/>shoulder. Just then the school bell rang. Growling, she changed<br/>the angle of her wooden mallet and smashed it up at the falling<br/>Ranma-kun. He was sent flying over the school wall, yelling,<br/>"Violent, crazy girl!"<p>Twisting around for the crevice in the wall Kuno's sword had<br/>made, Kane-chan ran as fast as she could.<p>She almost didn't notice she'd run over Kuno lying on the<br/>ground. Barely able to breathe, he said, "She has defeated me."<p>On his forehead was the character for, 'not'.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan ran for where Ranma-kun had landed, "Kei! You can't go<br/>to school like that!"<p>Ranma-kun spun around and struggled not to use his fists. He<br/>challenged her, "And WHAT'S to keep me!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The substitute teacher a story above them said, "Nabiki Tendou,<br/>what do you think you're doing with that bucket?"<p>Nabiki said, "Well, it's full of water."<p>The teacher made to take it away from her, "Of course it's full<br/>of water. It's for when I send a student out in the hall as<br/>punishment. Would you like to demonstrate how to hold-" The<br/>weak, old substitute accidentally spilled the contents.<p>Spla-ash!<p>Kaneda told Ranma-chan, "Never mind. Ranma and Kaneda ARE<br/>registered."<p>The red haired girl told the red haired boy, "Just because I'm<br/>registered doesn't mean-"<p>The teacher called down, "You two! Just because you got wet<br/>doesn't excuse you from your classes! You're late as it is!" The<br/>man asked his class, "Does anybody know who they are?"<p>Nabiki smiled, "Oh, yes. I know."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>And so Ranma-chan and Kaneda found themselves out in the hall<br/>with buckets a second day in a row.<p>Kaneda tried to explain, "If you were registered as a guy, you<br/>couldn't also be registered as a girl, now could you?" He tried<br/>to lighten things up, "Think of all the extra homework!"<p>Ranma-chan was not amused.<p>Kaneda continued, "At least this way you don't have to worry<br/>about getting splashed with water. There'll be less chance of an<br/>unregistered guy running about the school." And if they do<br/>catch her as a him, Nabiki's given me an answer for that, too.<p>Ranma-chan looked at him, about to say something. She thought of<br/>why she couldn't, and became even sourer.<p>Kaneda said, "Look, you're already registered as Ranma Saotome.<br/>If there was a guy around with the same name, people might start<br/>seeing how much the two Ranma-s look alike." Same answer as<br/>above, Nabiki said. It'd be only a matter of time before they<br/>figured out your secret."<p>Ranma snorted, "Hmf! You don't think anybody'll figure it out<br/>when they see a guy change into a girl in front a their eyes?"<br/>In the two long weeks she'd been changing, it had been a<br/>constant worry of hers.<p>Kaneda looked at her, I want to be the man and comfort you.<br/>...Only, then you wouldn't have to be the  hurt made<br/>him angry with himself. He looked away<p>Yes, I could tell her. I've lived with the secret all of my<br/>life. I know how it's worked for me.<p>Normally the change happened quickly, even in the blink of an<br/>eye. Unless there's a reason for somebody to be paying<br/>attention, they missed the change. And since just about<br/>everybody he'd met didn't believe magic was real, they didn't<br/>make the connection.<p>He glanced back at Ranma-chan. Sure we have red hair. But it's<br/>nothing too bizarre. It's just hair. A lot of Japanese dye their<br/>hair. He had to look away from her again, She probably doesn't<br/>know it disappearing and appearing acts to loose and get<br/>attention. It further disconnects our bodies in the minds of<br/>people. That's one of the reasons he had long hair.<p>There's really no reason for people to notice us: We look like<br/>an ordinary guy, and girl..."<p>Ordinary?<p>Kaneda had to look at Ranma-chan now, up and down: "Why DO you<br/>wear Chinese clothes?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The first period was over, the teacher was already gone to his<br/>next class. Everybody had a few minutes to break from the school<br/>routine and get into their own. To some that meant snacking. To<br/>others that meant playing games, either in their desks or out. To<br/>most it meant socializing, and most in a friendly fashion. To a<br/>very few, it meant catching up on homework.<p>Kaneda and Ranma-chan were not in that last minority. She said,<br/>"We actually got away with missin' school yesterday."<p>The brown haired Hiroshi Tsujitani smiled at the cute redhead,<br/>"This is Furinkan!"<p>On the other side of Ranma-chan, Daisuke Koyasu said, "Yeah!<br/>Don't ask questions, just enjoy."<p>Other students took glances in their direction, and muttered<br/>comments among themselves. Most were about how a babe like Ranma<br/>could get stuck with losers. Only the reminder that Kaneda<br/>wasn't a loser when it came to fighting kept them at a distance<br/>for the present.<p>Kaneda had moved up from his desk a couple of rows in front of<br/>Ranma-chan. Not wanting to irritate Ranma-chan any more, he<br/>squatted to her eye-level, "This place isn't as strict as most<br/>schools I've heard of. I sometimes wonder what would happen if I<br/>didn't turn in my homework."<p>Hiroshi thought that was a stupid question, "What do you think<br/>would happen."<p>Daisuke said, "Yeah! The same thing as happens to us: Bad<br/>grades."<p>Ranma-chan groaned, "You mean I do gotta study? I've been on the<br/>road so much a my life, I'm surprised I'm even allowed in a HIGH<br/>school."<p>Kaneda brightened, "I can be your tutor."<p>Ranma-chan glowered at him, "So I can owe you?" That hurt<br/>Kaneda. Without what he'd done to her already, he decided to<br/>back off for a while.<p>Daisuke said, "*I* could give you special lessons."<p>Hiroshi said, "Idiot! You just told her you get bad grades."<p>Daisuke said, "Yeah, but she just said I knew more than she<br/>does!"<p>Sayuri Toshio broke in, "But she's not dumb enough to think you<br/>could help her with anything."<p>Yuka Sudou said to Kaneda, "She's YOUR fiancée. Why aren't you<br/>keeping guys like this away from her?"<p>Kaneda said, "Uh, well... They're my friends?"<p>Yuka said, "Boys!"<p>Sayuri said to Ranma-chan, "Don't worry, Ran-chan, we're here to<br/>rescue you!"<p>As the girls moved in on her, Ranma-chan looked up at the clock,<br/>"Where's the next teacher? What's wrong with the clock! It<br/>says barely three minutes have passed!"<p>Hiroshi said, "This is Furinkan!"<p>On the other side from the two girls, Daisuke said,<br/>Yeah! Don't ask questions, just enjoy."<p>Ranma-chan did not enjoy the next two, long minutes. Only the<br/>distractions of the stupid questions of the guys saved her from<br/>the intelligent ones of the girls.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Unlike free time, class time seemed to go by quickly. Too<br/>quickly for Ranma-chan: Not only was Ranma-chan not following<br/>what the teacher was saying she knew what was going to follow<br/>the teacher.<p>Sayuki and Yuka were out of their seats as soon as the bell<br/>rang. They got to Ranma-chan before Hiroshi and Daisuke, or<br/>Kaneda. They picked up the conversation where they'd left off,<br/>"You still haven't told us why you're wearing clothes like<br/>that," Yuka said.<p>Sayuri asked, "The rumor about Kaneda making you wear them isn't<br/>true, is it?"<p>Daisuke said, "Kaneda'd never do something that stupid with a<br/>girl with a body like Ranma's!"<p>Ranma, using her martial arts speed and skill, got out of her<br/>desk before she could be surrounded again. "No! I just got back<br/>from a training mission in China." She was at a loss whether to<br/>go into her attack-or-defend stance.<p>Hearing a topic they could get into, more of the other guys in<br/>class joined in: "That's right! I've seen costumes like that in<br/>Hong Kong kung fu movies!"/ "But not in modern ones, dummy!<br/>Jackie Chan only wears Chinese clothes in period ones!"/<br/>"Maybe not Jackie Chan, but others! -It's like a...gi, a<br/>uniform for disciples of the, uh, Shao-lin Temple!"/ "Ha! The<br/>big expert."/ "Well, I think it's unpatriotic. She should wear<br/>the kind of gi the Japanese martial artists are known for."<p>Daisuke's eyes lit up, "Yes: Like Chun-li's gi in "Street<br/>Fighter"!" Then he added, "-Or Mai's in "King of Fighters"!"<br/>thinking of one that showed more flesh.<p>Hiroshi reminded him, "They wear Chinese-style costumes."<p>Daisuke told him, "But they were made by Japanese!"<p>Hiroshi only disagreed with his friend's logic in, "The Mai's of<br/>"Fatal Fury" is way better."<p>Sayuri, disgusted, said, "OR she could just wear a costume like<br/>Sakura of "Street Fighter"? At LEAST it would be a 'fuku'<br/>uniform."<p>Before they got outnumbered, other girls reinforced Sayuri and<br/>Yuka. They got between the guys and the new girl. "Never mind<br/>them. You know how boys are."<p>Ranma-chan thought, This is how boys are? Of COURSE she'd been<br/>around guys far than she had girls. Most of them had been<br/>adults: martial artists, monks, priests, and the odd-job<br/>employer. But she had had chances to meet other kids. Most of<br/>them had been boys. In the more traditional parts of Japan, her<br/>being a poor stranger with a strange dialect and strange clothes<br/>didn't encourage much contact with girls. If she did, that was<br/>ANOTHER excuse for the boys to fight her. She was a trained<br/>fighter. If they could beat her, they would prove themselves,<br/>with no disgrace in losing. She also had fights forced on her<br/>when she HAD gone to school. And it was an all-boys school more<br/>often than not. Again, always being the new kid didn't help.<p>Ranma-chan was beginning to realize just how much of an outsider<br/>she'd allowed herself to be. Of course she knew guys were<br/>interested in girls. But she wasn't. She'd never followed too<br/>closely what they had said. She was kept out of their cliques,<br/>anyway. Since she didn't allow herself to be interested in their<br/>patter, she hadn't realized just how important girls were to<br/>them.<p>But, now, she was no longer an outsider. She was at the CENTER<br/>of their thoughts.<p>Ranma-chan told them, "Back off, jerks!"<p>One girl in the back buffing her nails was amused, "I think it's<br/>cute guys think like that."<p>Ranma-chan exclaimed, "What kind of a nut is she!"<p>Yuka told her, "Never mind the class-pageant-contestant." It was<br/>only then Ranma-chan noticed how beautiful that girl in the back<br/>was.<p>Sayuri said, "Yuumei hasn't won as many as she claims. She has a<br/>Miss Congeniality problem."<p>Moving to keep shrug her shoulders away from either of the<br/>girls' friendly touches, Ranma-chan asked, "A what?"<p>Yuka explained, "She isn't congenial."<p>Sayuri said, "At least to girls."<p>A guy cried, "Cat fight!"<p>Ranma-chan turned pale. It, it's just an expression. No need to<br/>panic.<p>Yuumei said with a haughty air, "I DON'T cat fight."<p>Kaneda finally broke through the wall of guys; "Ranma-chan<br/>doesn't cat fight. It'd be an unfair fight."<p>Yuumei said, "You've got that right."<p>Ranma-chan pulled Kaneda towards her by the front of his white<br/>shirt. "Where have you been, pervert!"<p>Kaneda asked, "Pervert!"<p>Ranma-chan used him as a shield between her and where most of<br/>the class were, "Yeah: Pervert! You enjoyed watchin',<br/>didn'tcha!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>At the end of the third period it was Ranma-chan that was the<br/>first one out of the seat with her bookbag. She DID not want to<br/>be trapped with people, of either sex. Being an outsider all of<br/>her life had only prepared to BE an outsider. But it looked like<br/>that remaining one would be harder as a girl.<p>Using her speed and agility, Ranma hopped from one desk to<br/>another, over a girl, and off the heads of two guys who had<br/>stopped to watch her bouncing body parts. Another desk, and<br/>she was out the door with a clear head start.<p>Kaneda ran after her, "You know we have another class before<br/>lunch?" I didn't find out if her travels took her to foreign<br/>countries! "-And we EAT that in the classroom!" Japanese<br/>school kids dreamed of a cafeteria system. And the best this<br/>school had was a school store.<p>Ranma-chan wasn't about to tell anybody where she was going.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>By the time Kaneda had reached the hall Ranma was gone from<br/>sight. He looked both ways, and up, and checked to see if any<br/>windows were open. Kaneda said through gritted teeth, "I hope<br/>she hasn't skipped school again."<p>He took off for the nearest stairwell. Then he turned around,<br/>"The lav!"<p>When Kaneda got there he had to stop. He punched the air in<br/>frustration, "She went into the girls, I bet!" Only the<br/>smallest voice tried to argue Ranma was a guy.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>To go into the girls' restroom, Kaneda had to first use the<br/>boys' to become a girl.<p>A student in a buttoned-up navy plebe coat with an armband blew<br/>his whistle. "Halt! You are in violation of the rules of this<br/>school!"<p>The black haired girl had just come out of the boys' lav on her<br/>way to the girls'. It took her a second to realize, "Since when<br/>does Furinkan have hall monitors?"<p>The boy said in the manner of a soldier, "You are ordered to<br/>report to the infirmary."<p>Kaneda glanced at the windows to the outside. It was only the<br/>third floor. -Then: "Infirmary!" Maybe Ranma DID jump out a<br/>window.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan had been caught out of uniform; that is, in a boys'<br/>uniform. That was how she found herself now in a Furinkan girls'<br/>uniform. And the dress code included the requirement that girls<br/>wear a slip, bra and panties. The thought that she was now a<br/>GIRL only lessened her shame.<p>Of course, this wasn't the first time Kane-chan'd worn a dress.<br/>But it had always been for a better reason than this one:<p>The guy who'd been acting like a hall monitor said to the School<br/>nurse, "See, Aunt Hatsumi? I staked out the area of the<br/>yesterday's disturbance. That's how it's done at Komatane High!"<p>The attractive brown-haired woman in the white lab coat said,<br/>"And I DO think the rules should be enforced more around here.<br/>But Koshiro, you're not a student here. You're not even in the<br/>correct uniform." She looked at her nephew more closely. "And<br/>shouldn't you be out of your winter uniform by now?"<p>Not a hall monitor; not even a student? Kane-chan felt stupid.<br/>She tried to sneak behind the nurse and get her pants and shirt.<br/>Once she had them on, this strange girl could just disappear.<p>The nephew was an establishment-type clean through, "Aunt<br/>Hatsumi."<p>The nurse turned to talk to Kane-chan, "Is that your uniform,<br/>Miss?"<p>Kane-chan went on offense, "Does it look like it belongs to me?"<p>The nurse picked it up from where she'd placed it over the back<br/>of her chair, "As a matter of fact, it does. It fit you quite<br/>well. I take it you find a need to wear a boys' uniform?"<p>Kane-chan frowned gripping the skirt she was in. She still<br/>wanted to avoid answering, "Why do girls have to wear STUPID<br/>clothes! Why can't they wear normal ones, like guys?"<p>The nurse said, "I would've thought you would know about<br/>hormones by now. And it's not just those of the males. You HAVE<br/>taken gym class?" Kane-chan just nodded, Let her think I mean<br/>the girls'. "The girls' shorts are that short and tight because<br/>that's the way THEY wanted them. They weren't that way when I<br/>took gym. And my mother wore bloomers."<p>She saw how Kane-chan's face had gotten red. She saw the mixed<br/>emotions of anger, disgust and modesty but missed arousal.<br/>Sympathetically, she said, "At least you don't have to wear a<br/>mini fuku."<p>The nephew smiled, "Like Street Fighter's Sakura!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>After a battle of wills, the nurse let Kane-chan go without<br/>finding out her name. She was satisfied that she had gotten the<br/>girl into the proper uniform. "But the next time I see you not<br/>meeting the school dress code, I WILL report you." Kane-chan,<br/>though, didn't think that was the real reason she escaped. The<br/>nurse probably didn't want the administration finding out about<br/>her nephew being on school grounds.<p>Kane-chan learned a lesson at school, Rules can work against<br/>those who want them. Still, she WOULD have liked to have turned<br/>in the fink that had gotten her into this dress.<p>With no guys' uniform, Akane the unregistered student couldn't<br/>return to Kaneda's class. There was only one thing she could<br/>think to do. It had worked before.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The quietest way into the house was through the kitchen door.<br/>Kane-chan looked in the window, first. It WAS too early for<br/>Kasumi to be in there, right? But that left getting to the<br/>stairs and then to her room. Kane-chan had no idea where<br/>Kasumi's schedule had her. With any luck, she'd be out grocery<br/>shopping.<p>But first she had to get some water to change her body after<br/>she'd changed her clothes...<p>And that's when Kasumi walked in, "Oh, Akane!"<p>Kane-chan's nervousness made her slosh the water out of the<br/>glass onto herself.<p>Kaneda cried as he grew wider than the clothes. The elastics<br/>were stretched to their limits; the seams of the panties, slip<br/>and dress split. Finally, flexing his muscles, the constricting<br/>bra's fasteners gave. And so did some of the seams.<p>Kasumi blushed, "Oh, my!" and turned around. She continued to<br/>keep her back on him as he hurried out the door for the stairs.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Fifteen minutes later, Kasumi knocked on her young brother's<br/>door, "Kaneda? You haven't given me the uniform to mend."<p>It took a moment before he could find his voice, "You,<br/>remember?"<p>Kasumi said, "If you mean about...Akane, yes, I do. May I come<br/>in?"<p>When he didn't say no, she opened the door and came in, nodding<br/>politely as she crossed the threshold. Kaneda was dressed in his<br/>typical afterschool clothes of white socks, loose blue jeans and<br/>a red striped shirt. He stayed where his restless movement had<br/>last placed him, at his desk's chair. He couldn't look his<br/>sister in the eyes.<p>Kasumi saw the ripped girls' uniform and lingerie where it had<br/>been kicked. She sighed, "Oh, my, that will take no little<br/>sewing." She went and picked them up, "It is not yours. May I<br/>assume it's the school's property?" Kasumi gave her only the<br/>smallest of gestures. "We will just have to replace it. I still<br/>have my uniforms. Since it should be in your size, we will give<br/>one I've altered for you."<p>NOW Kaneda looked at her: " "Altered"?"<p>The garments over her arm she walked over towards him, "It was<br/>mother's idea. I learned to sew mainly from watching her alter<br/>Nabiki's and my hand-me-downs so that they could fit you...if<br/>you decided you wanted to be a girl." She smiled. "She didn't<br/>want us to know, but she even bought new things just for "Akane"<br/>when she could afford it. They were her "whims"."<p>Kaneda was stunned, "I, never knew any of that."<p>Kasumi sat on his bed. "She knew how important having a son was<br/>to Father. She already had her daughters. As long as you were<br/>happy being a boy, that's the way she said you should be<br/>treated. But she told me to pretend you were somebody else when<br/>you were a girl. That way you we would not have to think of<br/>Father's wishes, but yours. I always did my best to treat you<br/>like a girl then, so you could see if you liked it better."<p>Kaneda's ears burned red. He frowned, "Well, I-" didn't. He<br/>didn't finish the sentence. There HAD been times he liked being<br/>thought of as a girl. But he had Dad and the other guys around<br/>him to think about. He had to measure up to what they wanted.<br/>The things he didn't like about being a girl did help him<br/>convince himself he liked being a guy better. Mom and Kasumi by<br/>treating him differently had helped him see that.<p>Still, he had always been self-conscious as a girl, and afraid<br/>that people would find out. What if she HAD been able to<br/>separate Akane from Kaneda; would she have liked being a girl?<p>Kaneda looked back at her, "So all this time you've just been<br/>pretending not to recognize me?"<p>Kasumi smiled, "It was simpler. But Ranma doesn't make things<br/>simple."<p>Kaneda nodded, "That's for sure."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The clock said school was out.<p>Kaneda, now in his yellow kempo-uniform, was out in the dojo<br/>preparing for when Ranma came home. He was going through his<br/>katas. They were a little better than the standard routines most<br/>martial artists used. If Ranma WERE like most martial artists,<br/>he would stand a chance. He frowned, "Compared to her, I'm slow<br/>and clumsy." He still had his pride. It hurt to admit that.<p>But this was the School of Anything-Goes. The way Mr. Saotome<br/>acted reminded him of his dad's lesson: "Pride does not feed the<br/>evil, little bulldog in master's clothing."<p>Kaneda took a deep breath, and start coming up with a new line<br/>of attack for Ranma. I need something to throw her off<br/>balance. "When you're cranky you don't look that cute, you<br/>know!" Okay, it's a lie. But she doesn't WANT to be cute, yet.<br/>If I told her she WAS cute, it'd only increase her anger. And<br/>THAT would just add energy to her martial arts skills!<p>Just then the door to the dojo opened, and a hand with a letter<br/>came through it. Nabiki was holding it, "Here you go!" she<br/>smiled.<p>On the envelope was written, "To Ranma Saotome".<p>Kaneda asked her, "Why are you showing me this?"<p>Nabiki smiled, "I thought you might want to be on hand: To run<br/>interference. Ranma still might show up as a guy."<p>Kaneda looked at the challenge letter and nodded, "At least it's<br/>not addressed to "Kei Tendou". Fighting under a name other than<br/>his own could be the straw that breaks the martial artist's<br/>back." He hadn't actually answered to it this morning.<p>Nabiki recited, " "To Ranma Saotome; Please come to the second<br/>field of Furinkan High School this evening at 5:36 pm"."<p>Kaneda said, "It SOUNDS like a duel."<p>Nabiki agreed, "You know Kuno's a real sore loser. He's out for<br/>blood."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>But Kaneda didn't wanting Ranma to think he was trying to take<br/>over his fight. His temper had already caused him to interfere<br/>in one, that morning. He hurried into the house to change out of<br/>his gi.<p>Kasumi was just delivering a load of laundry upstairs. On top<br/>was one of his school uniforms. He quickly ducked into the<br/>living room and put that on.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda was there behind the school ahead of the appointed time.<br/>He spent that time first hiding then searching for Ranma.<br/>Finally, he stopped to scratch his head, "Don't tell me Ranma<br/>didn't hear about it? When Nabiki checked, the class told her<br/>Ranma had returned to class." He frowned again at his how Ranma<br/>had made a fool out of him. "She just disappeared during the<br/>free times."<p>That DIDN'T explain why she hadn't returned home. "She hasn't<br/>taken off entirely!" Kaneda realized that was a real<br/>possibility. Ranma had spent her whole life on the road. She<br/>didn't NEED a place to call home. He cursed her martial arts<br/>abilities, now. "She can protect herself. And that has got to<br/>give her the confidence to face the challenge of going it<br/>alone."<p>Kaneda almost fell over the sign in the field. It wasn't made<br/>like any of the normal school signs. It looked like- Kaneda<br/>hurried to read the panda's sign, [To change the home rules,<br/>change home ground!] Baseball? Why is it doing referring to<br/>baseball?<p>Something was thrown towards him. The sudden movement caused his<br/>hand to go out to attack or catch it. It was a water balloon.<p>Splash! It was a hot water balloon.<p>This time not only didn't she change her body, she changed her<br/>clothes. She looked in shock at the Furinkan girls' uniform she<br/>found on her. "How, how...?"<p>And somebody was coming! ...Speaking poetry? "A better prize,<br/>perhaps?" Kuno said. "For it so falls out what we prize not the<br/>worth whiles we enjoy it. But being lacked and lost, why then we<br/>rack the value. Then we find the virtue that possession would<br/>not show whiles it was ours."<p>He stopped before her. "It is now exactly 5:36 pm, the moment<br/>when the sunset is at its most beautiful: For it is the raising<br/>young star of the high school kendo world who shines before<br/>you." In a show of false modesty, he had turned his head away.<br/>"It is the one renowned as the Blue Thunder. Tatewaki Kuno."<p>Kane-chan's history of conflict with the idiot pushed all other<br/>thoughts from her mind, "Hey, where's that stick you're always<br/>waving around?"<p>Kuno put his face in profile again, and said quietly, "I have no<br/>need of it."<p>Kane-chan thought, That's different. "Ha-nh! Pretty confident,<br/>aren't you?"<p>Kuno said, "Confident enough to give you..." And he threw<br/>something at her: "This!"<p>Like a fool she'd caught yesterday's gauntlet before knowing<br/>what it was; like a fool she caught this.<p>It was a paper wrapped bouquet of a dozen red roses.<p>Before she could recover, Kuno was already walking away. "Akane<br/>Tendou, My Wild Haired Girl..." He looked over his shoulder<br/>directly at her. "...I love you." And he continued his dramatic<br/>walk away from her.<p>He was almost gone before Kane-chan could think to move.<p>But she couldn't move. She fell to her bare knees in the dress,<br/>the bouquet of flowers still cradled in her arms.<p>The End of this chapter.<p>[Note: Komatane High will be the school of "Futaba-kun<br/>Change!". Future tense. No crossover is planned.]
