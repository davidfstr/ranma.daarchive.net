</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>18: Atypical Chapter<p>[This is loosely based on atypical Episode Six.]<p>In Dr. Tofu's office, only the small, redhaired girl in<br/>black-with-red-trim, pajama-like Chinese clothes was<br/>sitting. But she wasn't sitting comfortably:<p>Ranma-chan's head was sharply cricked to the left.<p>But it was Dr. Tofu that was more bent, psychologically.<br/>"Progestin! Oral contraceptives! You know as an<br/>acupuncturist, I normally don't approve of pills-Ha, ha!<br/>Especially ones that are illegal in this country! Good<br/>thing I'm also a GP with connections!"<p>Kaneda looked at his older sister accusingly. Kasumi<br/>acted as if she didn't have a clue about what was going<br/>on. "Doctor, you said we shouldn't tell Kaneda's about<br/>his birth control pills!"<p>But the longhaired redhead knew she really wasn't really<br/>to blame; it was just the years of frustration over his<br/>coach and mentor being taken from him every time she<br/>showed up. Then he became somebody that was hard to<br/>admire. He muttered to himself, "Why does this have to<br/>happen to every generation of his family, until the<br/>astrological signs are right for-" Suddenly it<br/>registered with him what was being said, "Birth control!<br/>ME!"<p>Dr. Tofu bowed to Kaneda, "Congratulations! You'll soon<br/>be a mother!"<p>Kaneda cried, "MOTHER!"<p>The man in the black martial arts gi grasped his hand and<br/>pumped it violently up and down, "Or father!" He smiled<br/>over at his other patient, "Isn't that right, Ranma-<br/>chan?"<p>Ranma-chan nearly straightened her neck at this news:<br/>"WHA-OW!"<p>Dr. Tofu was already ignoring them as he went to tell<br/>Kasumi, "Isn't the red string a thing of wonder and a<br/>joy?"<p>Kasumi told him, "Doctor, that is ALSO something that was<br/>best kept a secret."<p>Ranma-chan stood up, demanding, "If I'm gonna have a kid,<br/>I think the doctor should tell me about it!" Under other<br/>circumstances Ranma-chan wouldn't have let herself get<br/>bothered by the idea she could become pregnant; the idea<br/>would've just been to far-removed from his normal sense<br/>of maleness. But ever since she'd arrived at the Tendous,<br/>things had seemed to be snowballing out of hand. She had<br/>even gotten brief strange feelings that could've been<br/>female.<p>Kaneda said, "You don't mean, uh, now, do you."<p>Dr. Tofu took the bony hands of his skeleton Beti and<br/>looked her in the eye sockets, "Ah, the red string: Love<br/>before first sight! No matter how far separated in space<br/>and time, it draws together those predestined to be in<br/>love, binding them even after death."<p>Ranma-chan looked sideways at the tall, muscular Kaneda,<br/>"I ain't marryin' an idiot just because some dumb<br/>folklore says I'm destined to!" Ranma didn't know that<br/>the concept had become an enchanted object. Though, one<br/>she wasn't wearing at the moment.<p>The ponytailed Doctor was going on as if he hadn't heard,<br/>"...Maybe your true love will be a foreigner-Maybe from<br/>America! -Or Samoa! Korea! China!" He kissed Beti's<br/>metacarpals, "Ah, like bone china."<p>The pigtailed girl stammered, "Chi, China?"<p>(Kaneda stammered as well, "Wh, what about OUR love? I<br/>thought THAT was what was predestined!")<p>Dr. Tofu remained lost behind the romantic glaze of his<br/>glasses, "...Modern travel does allow ANYONE from your<br/>many past lives to find you, now, doesn't it?" And he<br/>celebrated by taking unhooking his skeleton from her<br/>stand.<p>Ranma asked, "Just HOW many reincarnated lovers and<br/>rivals do you expect to find me?"<p>The Doctor who looked younger than he was danced with his<br/>Beti, singing an oldie, "When you're not with the one you<br/>love, love the one you're with..."<p>The primly dressed Kasumi could not stay mad at him, "Oh,<br/>Doctor! You're so entertaining!"<p>It was clear to Kaneda that Dr. Tofu was no longer able<br/>to provide any more intelligible answers. And Kasumi,<br/>too, was succumbing to the spell that kept them declaring<br/>their love.<p>Kaneda thought, A lot of good their red string seems to<br/>do them. At least their screwed up courtship proved<br/>Kasumi wasn't right for Ranma-chan. Doesn't it?<p>Ranma-chan cried, "I've had it! I'm outa this mental<br/>clinic!" Pushing some hot water-Very hot-from the<br/>carafe on the table, she splashed her face. And the<br/>pigtailed guy was headed for the door.<p>Kaneda said, "Talk about a screwed up courtships!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>In his long-sleeved silk outfit Ranma-kun was "playing"<br/>soccer with two 10-kg/20 lb. stones, bouncing them off a<br/>large boulder half-embedded in the ground, catching them<br/>with just his bare feet and kicking them back. Even as he<br/>was doing that he was digging out another from the soft,<br/>damp earth beside the river.<p>A voice up on the concrete levee said, "I would've<br/>thought you would avoid being near water when you could."<p>His head still at a 90-degree angle to his neck caught<br/>one of the stones so he could look at the speaker, "And<br/>*I* would've thought you'd avoid bein' a girl when you<br/>could."<p>The blackhaired Kane-chan told him, "I didn't think I<br/>could. Not with what's happened to you today. I went back<br/>and used the hot water dispenser in Dr. Tofu's office."<br/>She'd also picked up a sheet that had covered one of the<br/>Doctor's beds. This she'd wrapped around her sort of<br/>sari-like to cover her badly torn Furinkan dress.<p>Ranma-kun tossed his stone into the other one he'd kept<br/>kicking. The second stone bounced off of that and back at<br/>the boulder. The first stone, Ranma-chan started kicking<br/>again. He'd stopped looking at Kane-chan.<p>Kane-chan came down the large waffled slope of the levee,<br/>"I bet even in this body I can pick up that large boulder<br/>out of the ground and toss it into the river." Even she<br/>knew it was a dumb thing to say, but she couldn't think<br/>of anything else to start a conversation. It was the guy<br/>in her.<p>The blackhaired pigtailed guy continued doing what he was<br/>doing, unimpressed, "What a stupid idea. Don't you think<br/>*I* couldn't've done that? *I* know enough about a<br/>martial artist's responsibility NOT to throw things in<br/>where a boat or diver might hit it."<p>Kane-chan felt the stab. Ranma-chan WAS more responsible<br/>than she was. Her first impulse was to go on the<br/>offensive: "Oh! And so what do YOU do? You play games<br/>with it. If it's such a hazard waiting to happen, why<br/>don't you do something about it?"<p>Ranma-kun caught the first stone back on his instep,<br/>"What would you have me do, break it up into small<br/>pieces? Maybe with one finger, yet."<p>Kane-chan said, "Of course not with "one finger"!" She<br/>watched as the second stone was stopped by Ranma-kun's<br/>heel. But it's impact sent the first stone rolling up his<br/>leg and body and practically into his hands. It only<br/>reminded Kane-chan how much superior Ranma was. "But you<br/>CAN break stones! You DO know how to do karate, don't<br/>you!"<p>Ranma-kun seemed to think a moment, "Do I? Gee, why don't<br/>you show me." And single-handedly, he tossed the stone he<br/>held towards her.<p>Kane-chan used only one small hand to shove it back,<br/>"Jerk!" Her aim was off.<p>Ranma-kun had misjudged the girl's ability. He had to<br/>quickly try to bend his body and tilt his head to the<br/>right to get out of the way of heavy stone. His injured<br/>neck almost didn't allow him to get out of the way in<br/>time. It glanced off his cheek and jaw.<p>Kane-chan was strong for a girl, but the stone just<br/>missed making the short distance into the river.<p>Kane-chan asked, "Are you okay?" She was concerned, but<br/>more worried about the girl the guy became. Guys were<br/>expected to be tougher than girls.<p>Ranma-kun was still standing, "Hnh! It'd take more 'n<br/>that to phase me when I got my defenses up." Suddenly he<br/>noticed the stiffness was gone, "Hunh?" He bent his neck<br/>right and left and then again, "Hey, I'm cured."<p>Kane-chan's frown returned, "And more than just your<br/>neck, I see. Why ARE you acting relaxed and confident,<br/>now?" Since she'd found him by the river, this GUY wasn't<br/>like the uptight, over-reactive girl Ranma-chan had been<br/>lately.<p>Ranma-kun told her, "Because I'm a guy, now." He tugged<br/>on his black Chinese shirt, "...Wearin' silk." He looked<br/>out at the river. "It took this river to remind me. When<br/>I came to all of this water, I nearly freaked out."<p>He turned to her, "But I realized that wasn't me. This<br/>whole thing of isn't me." He kicked up a rock and caught<br/>it. (Kaneda instinctively backed up a couple of steps.)<br/>"I HAD thought I got my problem with bein' girl under<br/>control on my trip back from China." He casually tossed<br/>the 3-kg/6 lb. weight up and caught it. "Now, I think I<br/>was just distracted by havin' to look over my shoulder<br/>for something lavender, and all."<p>Kane-chan had to ask, "What?"<p>Ranma-kun shrugged broad shoulders, "All: The stuff that<br/>happened on my way back from China."<p>Kane-chan thought that this might be a good time for<br/>Ranma to be a girl, Then maybe her verbal skills would<br/>be better. But being a girl WAS the problem her guy-half<br/>was trying to deal with. Looking for something to say,<br/>she said, "Uh...There are a lot of people in China."<p>Ranma-kun started walking down the shore with his rock,<br/>"We stayed away from the cities. That was probably a<br/>mistake."<p>Kane-chan still had to pull teeth, "So you didn't see<br/>many people?"<p>Ranma-kun said, rolling it over and around in his hand,<br/>"Oh, we saw people! ...Rural, traditional types. And you<br/>couldn't help but let them see you."<p>Kane-chan said, "You, you mean as the girl?"<p>Ranma-kun hit the rock up into the air with his fist, "It<br/>was Pop's way of checkin' to see if I stayed a guy<br/>inside, I guess. Stupid Old Man, we were supposed to be<br/>hiding."<p>Kane-chan watched Ranma-kun catch the rock in his palm.<br/>"But instead you had everybody staring at you? And I bet<br/>the women were the worse."<p>Ranma-kun glanced over his square shoulder, "Yeah, how'd<br/>you know?"<p>Kane-chan knew. "When you're a girl, people don't look at<br/>YOU. It's all about what you look like, act like on the<br/>outside." That was one of many reasons she didn't like<br/>being a girl.<p>Ranma-kun looked ahead again, "It made me feel doubly<br/>foreign. So I guess I hid in plain sight, lettin' myself<br/>think the girl body was a disguise or something."<p>Kane-chan nodded, "I can relate to that."<p>Ranma-kun said, "Then this will help you feel better,"<br/>and he casually underhanded the rock.<p>The longhaired Kane-chan hurried away from the splash<br/>from the river, "Hey!"<p>Ranma-kun smiled as he spun around and walked backwards,<br/>"I thought you LIKED bein' a guy."<p>Kane-chan told him, "I'm a girl to make you feel better!"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Ha! I don't need you to make me feel<br/>better." And he turned his back on her.<p>Kane-chan hurried after him, "Hey! Give me a chance!"<p>The longer-legged Ranma-kun jumped into an empty boat<br/>tied up along the bank. "You have to catch me, first!"<p>Kane-chan pulled up her skirt and jumped before he could<br/>get away in it. But Ranma-kun had already bounded out of<br/>it.<p>Kane-chan leaped, too.<p>She hadn't looked. Too late, she saw that Ranma-kun had<br/>landed on a lone pier rising out of the water.<p>Kane-chan tried to back-peddle her bare legs away from<br/>the water. "WHO-OH!"<p>Splash!<p>Ranma-kun's smile remained. He enjoyed the sight.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>His smile had dimmed a few minutes later when he was<br/>walking the residential streets of Nerima. He even<br/>fiddled a bit with the elastic bands on his sleeves. He<br/>was used to them around his ankles.<p>Back in his Furinkan gray pants and white shirt, Kaneda<br/>was close behind him. Again with nothing better to say,<br/>he grumbled, "Now we're both guys."<p>Ranma-kun said, "Yep. ' Guess there's no reason to hang<br/>around me."<p>The redhaired Kaneda could think of a couple, including,<br/>You never know when you could become wet and the girl<br/>again. At least now I have strong shoulders you can lean<br/>on. Looking about for something to say, he saw the<br/>golden brass arc over the traffic mirror at the corner<br/>that let people see if there was a car coming. "I've got<br/>an idea. How much money do you have on you?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Why do you ask?"<p>Kaneda said, "Lend me some, because I'm starving."<p>Ranma-kun asked, "So am I. So why should I give you any<br/>money?"<p>Kaneda told him, "Because you're staying for free at our<br/>house?" That didn't really register with Ranma. It was as<br/>Kaneda thought, Ranma-kun was used to his dad bumming<br/>room and board for them wherever he could. Kaneda said,<br/>"If you treat me, I'll treat you soon. I'm more likely to<br/>have money than you, right?"<p>That did register with Ranma-kun, "I've worked."<p>Kaneda crossed his muscular arms, "I'm the son of martial<br/>artists. ...PROUD martial artists."<p>Ranma-kun's mood soured some. It WAS true: Ranma HAD<br/>worked before, and done things normally left to adults to<br/>do. But a lot of them he had had to do behind his pop's<br/>back. The Old Man had a list of things that were<br/>undignified for a people of their station to be seen<br/>doing. (Never mind some of the stupid things that WERE<br/>okay for them to do in public. How many times had Pop<br/>balanced Ranma on top of a "nimbus" ball as Ranma in a<br/>Monkey King costume spun plates on the end of a pole in<br/>front of a shop just for a couple of free dinners?) The<br/>only exception to his anti-manual labor list was if it<br/>could be made to look as if they were practicing their<br/>martial arts. "Anything can be used as martial arts<br/>practice!" Pop would then say out loud when somebody<br/>wandered by.<p>And Kaneda had guessed that, too. "My Dad says Martial<br/>Arts Lumberjacking, Ditch-digging, and Plumbing were<br/>developed so people like us could keep our heads up."<p>There! Pop WAS too concerned about saving his ugly face.<br/>Ranma could've have learned ALL of those by now, if he'd<br/>been allowed to have a real job. Wasn't the IDEA of us<br/>traveling for ten years was to learn different<br/>techniques! The list was probably there just because<br/>his pop was just too lazy to do hard work.<p>What Ranma didn't know was why Genma insisted on fooling<br/>himself that he was an honorable man. It had to do with<br/>the self-respect and reputation he'd lost as a young man<br/>learning from the wrong master. And Genma being an orphan<br/>without a family or heritage of his own hadn't helped,<br/>either. Something else Ranma didn't know about.<p>Kaneda said, "Why do you think I'm developing Martial<br/>Arts Carpentry? There's always the chance I could lose<br/>the dojo."<p>Ranma-kun said, "Why HAVE a dojo? I was raised so I could<br/>hire myself out."<p>Kaneda smiled a challenge, "Then you have the money?"<p>Feeling his pride as a guy at stake, Ranma-kun said, "How<br/>much money do you need?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma had enough for a several hamburgers and a couple of<br/>shakes from the nearby Golden Arches. They'd taken the<br/>bag out to the flagstone courtyard in a nearby park and a<br/>bench around a tree. Ranma had to wonder again at how<br/>uncrowded Nerima was compared to most urban places in<br/>Japan. They were the only ones about.<p>Not looking at each other, they ate their hamburgers in<br/>silence. That is they didn't talk to each other. They ate<br/>as noisily as any normal couple of guys. By the time<br/>they'd gotten to the shakes, they were listening to the<br/>other one slurp and chew.<p>Kaneda won when he belched. In Japan, burping was a way<br/>of expressing to your host that you appreciated the meal.<br/>But the host only heard a belch. They were eating an<br/>American-style meal, and Ranma-kun knew enough about<br/>American customs to know what a belch meant to their<br/>guys. He had been around military bases, and tourists,<br/>too.<p>Frowning, Ranma crumpled up the wrapper from his burger,<br/>and threw it for the waste can across the courtyard.<p>Kaneda then did the same.<p>Kaneda missed.<p>The longhaired guy got up and went over to the litter<br/>he'd left on the ground. But he immediately returned to<br/>the bench with it.<p>Sitting down, Kaneda aimed for the can, and got it in<br/>this time. Two points.<p>Kaneda tried to look pleased. The can was so far away it<br/>should been three points.<p>Ranma-kun said, "Whoopee."<p>The guy-Ranma wasn't allowing Kaneda to be pleased.<br/>Kaneda took out the double cheeseburger from the bag<br/>between them.<p>Ranma-kun said, "I ordered that."<p>Kaneda took a big bite out of it. He didn't bother<br/>chewing it thoroughly. As soon as he could he forced it<br/>down his throat with a loud gulp. "Whoopee. There are no<br/>dibs."<p>Ranma-kun had watched the Adam's apple move, "I'll<br/>remember that." He watched him take another large bite of<br/>the cheeseburger. "So, you're on the pill."<p>Kaneda nearly choked to death. He'd only discovered this<br/>afternoon that Kasumi had been slipping birth control<br/>pills into his meals. It'd never occurred to him that he<br/>might NEED something like that. The cheeseburger, in<br/>pieces and inside a bun, fell on a very clean flagstone.<p>Ranma-kun at least waited until Kaneda's stopped being<br/>blue in the face. "Aren't there side effects?"<p>Now Kaneda turned pale.<p>He whipped around, "No! Do I look different from every<br/>OTHER guy!"<p>The pigtailed guy pretended to study him. Kaneda knew<br/>he'd allowed the opening.<p>Ranma-kun said, "If I was interested, I'd ask about the<br/>size of your-"<p>Kaneda told him, "It's thicker than yours, THAT much I<br/>know! I saw yours when you took a bath that first day."<p>Ranma-kun quirked a smile, "So you ARE interested in<br/>guys."<p>Kaneda made fists over his knees, "I am not!"<p>The guy in the black "pajamas" took the last burger in<br/>the bag, "It's a good thing for you I try to keep in mind<br/>you're a girl, not a guy."<p>Kaneda stifled his frustration. He had wanted it to be<br/>the other way around! He didn't mind too much if Ranma-<br/>chan was better at martial arts than he was (as if he had<br/>much of a choice), but there HAD to be something that<br/>would make her see him as a man!<p>Unwrapping, Ranma-kun asked, "So, any side effects?"<p>Kaneda was on his feet, talking down at the guy, "Not as<br/>a girl, either! Dr. Tofu has examined me enough times to<br/>know how LITTLE to give me. You HEARD him, it only has to<br/>take care of a, uh, um... Of only a FEW of my guy cells!"<p>Ranma-kun finished what was in his mouth. Then, "Unless<br/>an ova remains behind after the change and ends up in<br/>their male counter part, the testicles."<p>Feeling suddenly deathly ill, Kaneda plopped back down on<br/>the bench. "That...can...happen...?"<p>Ranma-kun shrugged a male shoulder, as he finished the<br/>next bite. His mouth clear, "I really didn't pay that<br/>much attention to the sex ed. lectures I hadda put up<br/>with." He reached for his shake, "But it's funny what you<br/>know when you have a good reason to know."<p>Kaneda stared, seeing nothing, "Why haven't I ever asked<br/>Dr. Tofu for the details about what happens, or DOESN'T<br/>happen, when I change?"<p>Ranma-kun slurped the last of his shake. "Because you're<br/>too much of a coward to want to know?"<p>Kaneda's blue eyes became more focused, "And you're not?<br/>Have YOU let yourself be examined! You KNOW unlike me<br/>your base form is as the girl."<p>Ranma-kun refused to let the jerk get to him. "No it<br/>ain't. I started out as a guy and stay a guy until I<br/>hafta change."<p>Kaneda thought HE had the advantage, now, in this guy<br/>contest, "Is: It is easier for you to be a girl than a<br/>guy. Being a guy is what you change INTO."<p>Despite his promise to himself he wouldn't let things get<br/>to him again, Ranma-kun's hand squashed what remained of<br/>his burger. "That's not the way it works."<p>Kaneda smiled, "There's only one way to find out."<p>Ranma-kun frowned as he cleaned his hand with a paper<br/>napkin. He tossed it in his shake container, and tossed<br/>it, then all of his hamburger wrappers into the large bag<br/>they'd come in. This he crumpled up into a large ball and<br/>threw at the waste can.<p>He missed.<p>Ranma-kun got up, and walked to where the wadded up bag<br/>had fallen. He kicked it up with his bare instep, and<br/>bounced it off his knee into the can. One soccer point.<p>His senses noticed a familiar sound that seemed oddly out<br/>of place. When Dr. Tofu came running by, Ranma-kun could<br/>see the guy was acting more than just odd. He was<br/>laughing as he gave his skeleton a piggyback ride.<p>But that wasn't enough. The man in the black martial arts<br/>costume pulled the assembled bones from his back and<br/>tossed it high in the air as he held on by one of its<br/>hands. He leaped and spun and danced with her, never<br/>letting her bony feet touch the ground.<p>Ranma-kun watched all of this in silence.<p>Ranma-kun turned to the guy embarrassed for his mentor,<br/>"This is the guy I'm supposed to let examine me."<p>Kaneda defended his coach, "It ONLY happens when Kasumi's<br/>around! You're not the ONLY one with a curse, you know!"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Uh, hunh. And what does he change into<br/>when cold water gets him?"<p>Kaneda got up, leaving his litter behind, "It's true! Dr.<br/>Tofu won't talk about it. But I got to talk to his mother<br/>once when we visited her." Actually, Kaneda had followed<br/>him out of worry when his couch had a particularly bad<br/>case. Dr. Tofu thought Kasumi wanted invite him to party.<br/>The girls were competing by bringing the best dates they<br/>could get. Tofu had heard and built his hopes up. But<br/>Kasumi didn't approve of the idea and didn't go. Not that<br/>the Doctor ever found out his mistake.<p>Ranma-kun started walking, "And what excuse did his<br/>mother give." It wasn't a question.<p>Kaneda continued on, "Mrs. Ono said that the same thing<br/>happened to Dr. Tofu's father before they were married.<br/>It happens to all of the men in his family whenever they<br/>find the women with the right positive power."<p>Ranma-kun played along, "Power?"<p>Kaneda hurried to get ahead of him, "Magical Power! It's<br/>the Law of Sympathy, or something like that. "Like<br/>affects like"."<p>Ranma-kun said mildly sarcastically, "Oh, you know about<br/>magic?"<p>Kaneda said, "I've lived with changing into a girl all of<br/>my life. You don't think I'd want to find out why and<br/>how?" And I certainly wasn't getting any answers from<br/>Dad.<p>Ranma-kun accepted that.<p>Kaneda said, "I've studied what I could about magic. But<br/>Dr. Tofu discouraged me from going very deep into it. He<br/>says without the right protection, it's too dangerous."<p>Ranma-kun remained sarcastic, "The "right protection",<br/>like HE has."<p>Kaneda slipped past the shorter Ranma-kun, "Yes! That's<br/>what this whole deal with Kasumi is about. She has the<br/>power Dr. Tofu needs."<p>Ranma-kun looked at the guy briefly, and in disbelief,<br/>"Kasumi, your older sister, has a magic power?" He then<br/>hopped the bushes beside the lane.<p>Kaneda told him, "She DOES!" and leaped to follow Ranma-<br/>kun on the grass. "Haven't you felt it?"<p>Ranma-kun still wasn't buying it, "I guess I was too busy<br/>lettin' my problem become my trouble."<p>Kaneda rushed to get in front of him, "She's got the<br/>"Protection of the Innocent"."<p>Ranma-kun picked up his speed, "What I know about things,<br/>being innocent doesn't protect you." He snorted, "Hnh! It<br/>can be just the opposite."<p>Kaneda stopped to assert, "Not when you've got magic on<br/>your side! And magic is all about the mental construct<br/>you give it." He had to jog, now, "Kasumi uses her<br/>strange interpretation of zen to give herself the "Bliss<br/>of Ignorance". THAT'S when Dr. Tofu started acting like<br/>he does around her!"<p>Ranma-kun saw a wall, and headed for it. "So, her magic<br/>ignorance is protecting her from that guy."<p>It finally looked like Kaneda would get ahead of Ranma-<br/>kun, "As best as I can figure it, Kasumi is like a<br/>powerful river. Her bliss comes from the flow of the<br/>routines she can find in her life. Her protection comes<br/>because that flow is strong enough to sweep anything that<br/>disturbs it down with its current."<p>Ranma-kun easily leaped over Kaneda's head. Kaneda had to<br/>spin around. "Dr. Tofu is like a waterwheel: He uses<br/>Kasumi's flow for HIS power!" Though she was probably<br/>more like an auxiliary motor; Kaneda was sure the Doctor<br/>had other sources of magic.<p>Ranma-kun stopped to crouch on the wall top, "Oh, right:<br/>The crazier her acts, the more powerful he's getting.<br/>Brother!"<p>Kaneda knew Ranma-kun was looking down on him, "Rivers<br/>have swells-Surges! That's what happens when Kasumi gets<br/>too close to him! There's just too much of her presence."<p>Ranma-kun shook his male head, and stood up, "She floods<br/>his mind, and like a river, isn't aware of it. She can't<br/>be "Ignorant" and "Blissful" all of the time."<p>Kaneda told him, "That's when the river is changing its<br/>bank. Rivers are always meandering. But they're ALWAYS<br/>flowing towards the same place, the sea. And after that-<p>Ranma-kun walked away, hands in his pockets, "Talk about<br/>mental constructs. I think you're just scared to go<br/>against your big sister."<p>Kaneda said, "Then I challenge YOU to stand up to her."<p>Ranma-kun said, " ' Sure will. The first time she wants<br/>me to do something I don't."<p>Kaneda used his longer legs to catch up, "Just let me<br/>know when you do. I want to be there to see it happen to<br/>you, too."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>They didn't talk to each other for minutes more. Kaneda<br/>finally said, "Speaking of silk."<p>Ranma-kun said, "I wasn't talkin' about anything. And I<br/>ain't listenin'."<p>Kaneda said, "I know you can see flaws in me comparing<br/>Kasumi to a river. But there are flaws in all magical<br/>constructs. The magic of an idea only works as long as<br/>you can make it work for you. THAT'S where your idea<br/>about silk protecting you from getting pregnant comes in.<br/>It may work for you, but it won't work for me, because I<br/>can see the flaws in the logic."<p>The pigtailed guy continued on his walk along the walls,<br/>"You're tryin' to get back at you for tryin' to ignore<br/>you by pointin' out the flaws in my logic. ' Get me to<br/>doubt that silk is be my talisman."<p>Kaneda said, "No!"<p>Ranma-kun squatted down to look him directly at the guy<br/>with the stupid red hair, "Well it won't work. I'm too<br/>stubborn. I'll believe what I want to believe no matter<br/>what anybody's got to say. And now that I got my self-<br/>confidence back, I can reinforce that with positive<br/>energy. That's why I'm so good bein' martial artist."<p>Kaneda heard Ranma-kun's boast as a challenge. Fighting<br/>against himself to respond to it, Kaneda said, "If I<br/>WANTED you to get pregnant, I could keep repeating, "Your<br/>body keeps more sperm cells than you think". If I say<br/>that over and over again, your subconscious WILL start<br/>letting it happen."<p>He hung his head, "Of course, that would mean I'd<br/>probably convince my own before yours."<p>Ranma-kun said, " ' Shows how much confidence you have in<br/>yourself." Then he laughed, "But thanks! I'll just keep<br/>tellin' myself that ALL of the things stay where they're<br/>supposed to stay."<p>Kaneda glared up at him, "That will only work once you<br/>have the confidence to get over your silk fetish. ARE you<br/>so sure in your ability to believe what you want to<br/>believe? Any little doubt, and you WILL become pregnant."<p>WHAM! Kaneda HAD met the challenge. Ranma-kun was thrown.<br/>Now to keep the guy in her off-balance, "Why not try for<br/>something you can SEE. Get yourself to believe that you<br/>DON'T have to change."<p>Angry, Ranma-kun speed up his travel along the walls, "I<br/>know enough about magic to know that won't work. It<br/>wasn't MY idea to keep changing into a girl."<p>Kaneda jogged after, "-Or mine!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda asked, "We're stopping at the clinic again?"<p>Ranma-kun told him, "I forgot my schoolbag."<p>Kaneda realized, "So did I!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The panda stopped pacing the lobby when it saw Ranma-kun<br/>come in. THEN it frowned even more when it saw Kaneda<br/>come in behind him.<p>The black-and-white animal came up to Ranma and began to<br/>lecture him about something, "Berao baru byoroa mummba,<br/>rramaaru!"<p>Ranma-kun walked by it. "Geez, you'd think Pop'd use some<br/>hot water to change back."<p>Kaneda coldly looked at it, "Maybe he likes being a<br/>panda."<p>The huge animal swung its attention onto the outsider.<p>Kaneda met its beady gaze, "Do you feel man enough to<br/>take me on?"<p>The panda held up a sign, [That's supposed to be Ranma's<br/>line!]<p>Kaneda told it, "Ranma thinks I'm a girl."<p>The panda signed, [But you LOOK like a guy!]<p>Kaneda thumbed his chest, "I'm every bit a guy as Ranma's<br/>a girl! We DO have the same curse, you know."<p>The panda growled in frustration. It's claws twitched,<br/>readying themselves for-<p>Ranma-kun poured a teakettle of hot water over it, "Leave<br/>AKANE alone, Pop."<p>Genma told his son, pointing, "Did you HEAR what that boy<br/>just said, Ranma! WHY do you let him get away with<br/>treating you like that! Challenge him to a real man-to-<br/>man fight and get this nonsense over with!"<p>His bookbag over one shoulder, Ranma-kun pushed his old<br/>man towards the door, "I'll explain things on the way<br/>back."<p>Kaneda noticed that Ranma-kun had only his bookbag. And<br/>there was also the matter of, "Hey, if Mr. Saotome works<br/>here, who's going to close up the clinic?"<p>The male teen said, "I guess you are. You DO like the<br/>doctor." And he tossed Kaneda the teakettle, "Why don't<br/>you make yourself pretty for him."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It was sunset on another unusually beautiful April day in<br/>Nerima. The first couple of days Ranma'd arrived with its<br/>on-again-off-again rain and storms were typical for the<br/>latitude Greater Tokyo was in this time of year. But<br/>Ranma wasn't about to complain about this good spell of<br/>weather, especially as long as he was under the bad spell<br/>of Juusenkyo.<p>The man in the white gi, as usual, tried to do keep the<br/>offensive, "Ranma, did you hear what that BOY said? He<br/>asked me if I were MAN enough to take him on!"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Yeah, so?"<p>His sensei told his only student, "That's what YOU'VE got<br/>to do! If he's got you thinking of him as a girl, then<br/>challenge him THAT way. Be MAN enough to take her on that<br/>way: Man-to-girl!"<p>Ranma-kun said, "That's just about the most disgusting<br/>plans you've ever come up with, Pop. Even if Akane were a<br/>girl all the time, I wouldn't do it. I've never been into<br/>that whole boy/girl thing. YOU of all people should know<br/>that."<p>Genma now had to regret the way he brought up his son,<br/>now. If he hadn't had his own life ruined by an evil<br/>gnome, then his approach as a father may have been<br/>different. The last thing he had thought he wanted was to<br/>have to deal with another pervert. "What am I to do with<br/>you, Boy! You refuse to treat Soun's child as EITHER a<br/>guy or a girl! How DO you intend to get rid of Kaneda?"<p>The teenager asked casually, "If I get rid of Akane, what<br/>will you do?"<p>Genma told him, "Why, I'd get you engaged to a fine,<br/>proper young girl. Kasumi Tendou, for example. There's a<br/>girl who knows how to be the traditional, ideal woman.<br/>Let me do the matchmaking, and you don't have to know<br/>ANYTHING about women."<p>Ranma-kun said, "There: YOU'RE the reason why I don't<br/>want to get rid of Akane, yet. Why stop makin' you<br/>unhappy. As long as she doesn't try to do anything when<br/>she's a guy, I don't see the advantage of being rid of<br/>her."<p>Genma said, "He's TRYING to make a girl out of you,<br/>Boy!"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Yeah, that WAS gettin' to me. I was even<br/>startin' to forget she was really a girl." Then he said<br/>more to himself, "But the curse is the curse! To forget<br/>would be like sayin' I'm not a guy when I'm not." He<br/>looked at his pop for the first time, "But I AIN'T gonna<br/>forget!" It had the intensity of a vow.<p>He stopped on the bridge, "Look, Old Man, I realized<br/>today that the whole, damned world can believe I'm a<br/>girl, for all I care. It's ME who decides what I am. The<br/>outside doesn't really matter. What if I'd fallin' in the<br/>"Spring of Fat, Ugly, Bald Old Man"? Should I let myself<br/>act like one?"<p>Genma said, "Of course not!" Only then did he suspect<br/>he'd been insulted.<p>Ranma-kun was already looking ahead, at the goal he had<br/>set for himself, "Bein' fat would be the worse part. As a<br/>martial artist it'd gotta effect my skills. I'd have to<br/>start a whole new trainin' program just to compensate."<p>Genma said, "Are you implying that I'm not at LEAST up to<br/>your level as a martial artist. C'mon, Boy! I'll show you<br/>just how fat this-"<p>Ranma-kun tripped his pop over the railing of the river's<br/>bridge.<p>Splash!<p>The hard-muscled teen in the loose Chinese silk leaned<br/>against the railing as he looked down at the panda,<br/>"Bein' a girl most of the day at school HAS shown<br/>there're gonna be times when I am in the girl-body. If I<br/>have to go find some hot water so I can fight, it'd be<br/>almost as bad as havin' to have a guy save me."<p>The panda swiped its paws up at the boy looking down at<br/>it. It loudly dared him to a fight there and then.<p>The pigtailed guy cupped an ear, "What'd you say, Pop?<br/>Bein' a girl isn't on your list of things that'd be<br/>undignified for me to do?" He took his hand away, and<br/>raised it in a half-salute that turned into a good-bye<br/>gesture, "I'll remember to keep it lookin' like I'm<br/>learnin' new fightin' techniques!" He grinned, "After<br/>all: ANYTHING can be turned into martial arts trainin'!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The sun still hadn't set when Kaneda walked in the front<br/>gate. He found the redhaired Ranma-chan going through her<br/>katas out in the area of sand in front of the dojo. He<br/>watched her for a few minutes. She had the cutest face<br/>and body he'd ever seen, even in the loose, black Chinese<br/>clothes she was wearing. Every movement would bring<br/>suggest another curve; and when that one was gone with<br/>the next movement, there was another curve to trace.<br/>Curves were what THIS little dynamo was about. It made<br/>him want to despise the skinny, straight-edged things<br/>called models. Even those who had something on top<br/>couldn't match Ranma-chan's. It wasn't just that hers<br/>were still free to move about. It was HOW they moved. She<br/>hadn't had much practice keeping them from jiggling about<br/>any more than had to. And what's more, she prided herself<br/>in being able to take aches and pains: Which meant it<br/>would take her even longer to learn how to wear her<br/>adipose. Hopefully, anyway.<p>The trim, little redhead started taking glances his way.<br/>He knew he couldn't be a spectator any longer. Tossing<br/>his bookbag aside, he stepped into the arena, "Mind if I<br/>join you in your practice drills?"<p>Ranma-chan said a little scornfully, "You think you can<br/>keep up?"<p>The much taller Kaneda slipped right into the familiar<br/>routine she'd been doing, "In your present condition? As<br/>a guy, I can."<p>In response, Ranma-chan turned a kick into a leap. While<br/>still in the air, she did a series of complicated<br/>thrusts, grabs, throws, and stomps that would've taken<br/>Kaneda a minute to complete on the ground.<p>By the time she'd landed from that one jump, Kaneda had<br/>ground his movements to a halt. "I thought you weren't as<br/>good when you're the girl."<p>Ranma-chan frowned at the idiot, "I'm not! These drills<br/>are just shadowboxin'. It almost doesn't matter if I'm a<br/>guy or a girl when I do them. I need somebody to spar<br/>against so I can learn to compensate for my shorter arms<br/>and legs, lighter weight, and all the other stuff I'm not<br/>attuned to, yet."<p>Kaneda understood that. He, too, became the other sex.<br/>There were just too many differences in the two bodies to<br/>bring the skills you learned in one body without having<br/>to drastically compensate. So he had to ask, "How is it<br/>you're able to use your other body so well?"<p>Ranma-chan went over the pail of water, "A martial<br/>artist's mental-TIRING-discipline. It's almost like<br/>learnin' to fight in a new style I'm not used to." She<br/>dipped her hand in the pail, and rubbed the water on her<br/>face to cool off, "That's why I've got to practice until<br/>it's second nature to me: Something I DON'T have to think<br/>about. Just do!"<p>Kaneda had allowed his guard to be down:<p>Splash!<p>Drenching wet and angry, Kaneda ran! "That was a dirty<br/>trick! I don't WANT to be a girl, now!"<p>Ranma-chan chased the redhaired guy, rubbing her hands<br/>together building up the heat of the friction while<br/>building up the heat of her battle aura, "You OWE me!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Back in her apron Kasumi was in the kitchen preparing<br/>supper. Hearing the commotion outside, she smiled. "Mr.<br/>And Mrs. Temple Priests did sense the connection between<br/>those two. After one day, their enchanted pieces of red<br/>string already have them acting like SUCH good friends."<p>The door opened and her brother came in yelling, "I'm not<br/>going to spar with you! The LAST thing I want is grapple<br/>with you as a girl!"<p>Ranma-chan pounced, "Ha! I'll use the energy of your OWN<br/>anger to add to the heat of my "Saotome Instant Hot Water<br/>Attack" work!"<p>Kaneda cried in outrage as he felt the water on him<br/>become hot enough to change him into a girl, too.<p>But it hadn't been hot enough to change Ranma-chan. The<br/>pigtailed girl grabbed what remained of Kane-chan's dress<br/>and pulled her back out the door and towards the dojo.<br/>Ranma-chan explained, "Sparrin' ain't fightin'! You<br/>should be enough of a martial artist to know that!"<p>Trying to rip enough of what remained of her uniform to<br/>get away, Kane-chan yelled, "Why don't you want to spar<br/>in my GUY form!"<p>Before Ranma-chan could answer Kane-chan's broke out of<br/>the last of her outer clothes.<p>She fled into the house and out the kitchen door in just<br/>her blue polka dot bra and panties.<p>Ranma-chan chased after her, "Come back here and fight<br/>like a girl!"<p>When she had the kitchen to herself again, Kasumi<br/>realized, "Oh, my! BOTH Ranma and Akane have lost the red<br/>strings I sewed into their clothes! -And I didn't have a<br/>chance to sew a piece in Kaneda's uniform last night, I<br/>was so busy with the rest of his laundry!"<p>Kasumi tried to decide if she should blush, "Oh, my! If<br/>it's not the red string's magic, what could be keeping<br/>them together?"<p>Perhaps to have a cursed relationship, there has to be a<br/>relationship.<p>The End of this chapter<br/>[Was the original, Takahashi-sama's Akane cursed as well?<br/>Can anybody be that blind to the truth on her own?]
