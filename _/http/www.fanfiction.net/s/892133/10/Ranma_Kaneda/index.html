</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>10: A Doll For Two<p>[Note: Scenes where the focus is on Nabiki or Kuno are<br/>marked with a dollar sign ($). Scenes where the focus is<br/>on Kasumi are marked with a plus sign (+). Scenes about<br/>everybody else are marked with a pound sign (#).<br/>Summaries are after "The End".]<p>Kane-chan leaped back onto the flagstone he'd started<br/>from. She turned around, and took up a triumphant stance<br/>in her white dress with the bows and frills. Only mildly<br/>breathing hard, the black-haired girl said to the red-<br/>haired girl, "Are you ready to be trapped inside the<br/>corset?"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "No! There ain't no corset! It's all<br/>in the sick old priest's sick mind and yours!"<p>Kane-chan confidently smiled, "We'll see how long you<br/>believe THAT!" And she pulled the red string she imagined<br/>in her hand.<p>Ranma-chan leaped before the snare could be closed:<br/>"Ha!"<p>Pebbles from the Shinto priest's blowgun rapidly struck<br/>Ranma-chan's lumbar vertebrae. "Hey!" The impact<br/>affected her balance.<p>Ranma-chan fell back onto the temple's stone courtyard,<br/>"Ouf!"<p>Kane-chan cried, "Yes: I have bound you!"<p>(Her father cried, "Oh, Akane!" He tried to cover his<br/>eyes. But the tea set he was holding got in the way.)<p>Ranma-chan cried back, "No you did-" As she was shoving<br/>herself off the ground, she felt tightness around her<br/>waist. "What gives!" she put a hand on the area, "I<br/>KNOW I didn't pulled a muscle." ...Make that muscles.<br/>Sitting up, she brought her other hand up, too, "Why do<br/>this stupid narrow waist feel even narrower!"<p>Kane-chan walked toward her, "Because that's what corsets<br/>do: They constrict the waist area."<p>Ryoushin, the old priest, cackled, "Corsets emphasize the<br/>woman's figure! They are FOURTH after brassieres,<br/>bustles and high heels in importance in shaping a woman!"<p>Ranma-chan stammered, " "Sh, sha, shaping"! As in<br/>makin' you more of a woman!"<p>The old priest said as an enthusiastic student of love,<br/>"But MORE than the others, its hourglass figure announces<br/>to the world the woman is not pregnant!"<p>Ranma-chan turned white, "Pre, gnant!..."<p>(Kasumi cried, "Oh, My!"<p>(She and the old priestess had just come out of the<br/>building that hid the accursed well. The old priestess<br/>quietly told Kasumi, "Do not worry. The corset shiatsu<br/>will wear off soon." Then she frowned towards her<br/>husband, "Unless the old fool forgot that it was not<br/>meant to be permanent.")<p>Kane-chan had reached Ranma-chan, "The priest said NOT<br/>pregnant. ...As in "yet"." I can't believe I said that.<p>Ranma-chan glared up at her as she got up on her own,<br/>"Oh, THAT makes me feel better!" Straightening out, she<br/>put a hand to her diaphragm, "If I wasn't trained to<br/>breathe outward from the sides, this could interfere with<br/>my skills."<p>Kane-chan said, "That's good. I want you to know I don't<br/>want your martial arts abilities compromised. They mean<br/>too much to you."<p>The old priest joined them, "Very eloquent. Benten is the<br/>goddess of eloquence, you know."<p>Ranma turned her glare to him, "What ISN'T she a goddess<br/>of!"<p>The old priestess clapped her hands, "It is time to<br/>LEAVE! The water vapor of this place is beginning to<br/>affect you. Too much time here and you will talk in fine<br/>words empty of inspiration and reason!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Meanwhile, Tatewaki Kuno, heir to an ancient samurai<br/>legacy and the fortune their ways brought, sat in a<br/>humble eatery. He gazed not at the gaggling geese of<br/>ordinary girls around him, but at what he held in his<br/>hands. She was a blue eyed, blond dolly in a frilly white<br/>apron, pink dress and two hair ribbons. "Yea, you art the<br/>very image of my dearest ones! Or, rather, the image they<br/>would have, had they been allowed to express their true,<br/>and full femininity. But, nay: The vile, and disreputable<br/>Tendou clan get their evil power from stealing<br/>reputations!" His voice rose higher with his passion,<br/>"But this pure heart will win your freedoms, so that you<br/>may be adoring ladies of my court!"<p>He had stood to hold the doll aloft in one hand.<p>A voice that could have been that of the doll's said,<br/>"What an idiot."<p>He hadn't noticed that all other conversations had<br/>stopped.<p>Another voice answered, "I'll say! Where does he get his<br/>stupid ideas!"<p>A third said, "He's probably been 'INSPIRED' by an O.D.<br/>of samurai tales."<p>A fourth said, "More like heroic boys' mangas and<br/>animes."<p>A fifth laughed, "He thinks he has the "eternal fighting<br/>samurai spirit alive within"!"<p>A sixth joined her, "Just like my EIGHT-year-old<br/>brother!"<p>A seventh grinned, "What is it your little brother says?<br/>"What is a hero without implacable enemies to temper your<br/>manhood against"." More girlish laughter followed.<p>Since the restaurant was full of girls, and not a boy in<br/>sight to take retribution on, Kuno seated himself again.<br/>He was enough of an aristocrat not to blush in front of<br/>the hoi polloi of the opposite sex.<p>Though he almost lost that resolve with: "Do you think<br/>that's the ONLY doll he has?"<p>"*Giggle* As in "anatomically correct"?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>Ranma-chan quoted, " "Talk in fine words empty of<br/>inspiration or reason"?" And he walked to where her pop<br/>was snoring, "Then I'd BETTER get Pop outta here: He<br/>doesn't need to be any more like that!"<p>Ranma-chan reached down and hefted the overweight man<br/>onto a shoulder. It wasn't a spectacular show of<br/>strength; her back was bent under the burden, but she did<br/>it.<p>Still, Kane-chan was impressed; "You can do that in a<br/>corset?"<p>Ranma-chan didn't like that thought. "I can think of it<br/>as a straw back brace, like many men of Japan wear!"<br/>Again with the "Urusei Yatsura" reference: That's what<br/>Ryuunosuke's psychotically manly father was always<br/>wearing.<p>Kane-chan thought, Stubborn! That's also supposed to be<br/>for virility.<p>The old priestess hurried to usher everybody out, "This<br/>temple WILL give the unfortunate nine abilities."<p>Kasumi asked, "Oh, my, you mean..."<p>Mrs. Priestess nodded towards her, "Yes. The curse is to<br/>have the ability, but not the CAPABILITY. For the talents<br/>to mean anything, there has to be the blessing of the<br/>goddess of reason and inspiration."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, how tragic."<p>Soun Tendou joined the others after putting the tea set<br/>on the temple porch. "Akane, may I speak with you, now?"<p>Ranma-chan had reached the corner of the main hall still<br/>carrying her pop. "Go ahead and talk with him, 'Akane'!<br/>'Cause I ain't gonna be engaged to you, contest or no<br/>contest!"<p>Genma Saotome stirred, "Contest! What contest!"<p>(Kane-chan saw another blowgun dart in Saotome's neck.<br/>The antidote! She scowled, That old priest has perfect<br/>timing.)<p>Before Soun could inform his friend, the old priest broke<br/>in, "The dark-haired girl has won the right to red-haired<br/>girl's hand!"<p>Genma pushed himself up off of Ranma-chan, "What!"<p>Ranma-chan dropped him. She stood over him, "I did NOT<br/>lose! Ranma Saotome doesn't lose!"<p>Kane-chan told Ranma-chan (and her father), "At martial<br/>arts: But this wasn't martial arts! It was a test to see<br/>which one of us DESERVED to be blessed by the goddess. I<br/>won!"<p>Genma was still confused. Soun told him, "It seems Akane<br/>has her cap set on your son. And she apparently doesn't<br/>care if he's a girl."<p>Ranma-chan said, "What'd you mean "IF"!"<p>Soun had a thought about his would-be daughter-in-law,<br/>"You don't suppose young Akane...has an unnatural<br/>preference?"<p>Genma said, "To put it politely in your company."<p>The old priest yelled, "Hail and Farewell Attack!" A<br/>shower of pebbles began to rain down on all but Kasumi,<br/>behind him.<p>The martial artists ran for the way out.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki entered the restaurant where her "date" with Kuno-<br/>baby was to begin. How appropriate they would meet at the<br/>place where they had broke up. The proprietress paused<br/>from her work to greet her, "Come in! Come in!"<p>Nabiki looked around the crowded little place. She got<br/>the satisfaction of seeing Kuno waiting. He was hiding in<br/>a far corner with his back to everybody else.<p>When Kuno turned, Nabiki saw to her disappointment it<br/>wasn't because he had sensed her presence. He looked<br/>unusually quiet and pensive for him. Was he looking<br/>towards some laughing girls?<p>Well, Kuno-baby had chosen this place to meet. The idiot<br/>SHOULD be ashamed to be seen there. As she remembered it,<br/>she had made quite a scene that last time they were here.<p>But would that have really penetrated that thick head of<br/>his?<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>The Saotomes were out the gate before everybody else.<p>Kane-chan was pulling on her dad's arm, when he stopped<br/>her. He cried, "Kasumi! Where is Kasumi!"<p>Kasumi called from within the temple walls, "Right here,<br/>Father!"<p>The old priestess said, "She'll be with you presently.<br/>SHE will be one blessed by the goddess."<p>Before her father could say anything, Kasumi said, "No,<br/>Mrs. Priestess. Oh, my, no. I am not ready to have my<br/>life changed."<p>The old woman told her, "But I still have things to tell<br/>you!"<p>Kasumi said, "Then you can tell me as we go down this<br/>long stairway." She called to the others: "Go ahead! I'll<br/>meet you all at the bottom!"<p>Kane-chan pulled harder on her dad, "Come on, you heard<br/>her." He looked down at Ranma-chan. The pig-tailed girl<br/>had stopped because her father had to catch his breath.<br/>As Kane-chan watched Ranma-chan yell at her father, she<br/>thought, I have to get down there before Saotome does<br/>get his wind back! He's going to try and take back<br/>whatever control I won over Ranma!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki brought the tray with her meal over to the table<br/>Kuno-baby was sitting at. He was waiting impatiently but<br/>nobly. It was tempting to make him stew a little longer.<p>But she sat down, and uncovered her bowl. She said in a<br/>tone that told him she hadn't forgiven him yet, "What's<br/>this all about? It's not like you to treat a girl to<br/>snacks." She broke her chopsticks apart as emphasis.<p>Kuno said, "I have a favor to ask. Keep it in mind that a<br/>man in my position is not accustomed to asking for<br/>favors. I would take it ill indeed if you were to take me<br/>lightly, Nabiki Tendou."<p>Nabiki had been trying to enjoy her dumplings in sweet<br/>red bean soup. She said to the jerk, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/>So spill it already. Now, what can I do for you, Kuno."<p>Kuno said, "Well, I shall swallow my pride." It took him<br/>a second to do that. "It's this," and held up the<br/>collectable.<p>Nabiki looked. "What is "this"?"<p>Kuno told her, "It's a cute, little dolly."<p>Nabiki told him, "I know THAT. But what is it for?"<p>Kuno told her, "It is a present."<p>Nabiki waved it off, "No, thanks." Now that she had a<br/>good look at it, it was too cheap to be a collectable.<br/>She went back to her meal.<p>Kuno told her, "I never said it was for you, Nabiki. It<br/>is a token of my affection for Ranma Saotome, the Pig-<br/>tailed girl."<p>Nabiki stopped her eating. She had been playing the<br/>"former girlfriend" and had forgotten why she was there.<br/>The thought of That's, for, FOR RANMA! was too much: It<br/>was to laugh.<p>Nabiki did laugh, and though she tried to keep it in the<br/>food in her mouth got out. "Ha! Ha! Ha! Ah, Ha! Ha! Ha!"<p>She stifled it as soon as she could. She placed her face<br/>back on with a threat-like, "Now look at what you made me<br/>do, Kuno."<p>His own face covered with her half-chewed food, Kuno<br/>returned with controlled anger, "So sweet and voluble<br/>your discourse."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>Kane-chan ran down the stairs ahead of her dad. "Ranma!<br/>You're wearing the corset, that makes YOU the girl!"<p>Genma Saotome yelled, "What!"<p>Soun Tendou said, "Well, something did happen to Ranma."<p>Ranma-chan screamed, "Just 'cause somebody FORCES me into<br/>something doesn't make me "the girl"!"<p>Kane-chan stopped out of Saotome's swing; "That somebody<br/>was the goddess!"<p>Soun Tendou said, "Well, we WERE at the goddess's<br/>temple."<p>Genma Saotome studied his child, "ARE you wearing a<br/>corset, boy!"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "It's invisible!" feeling it. Then she<br/>screamed directly at Kane-chan, " And if we're talkin'<br/>about goddesses, what about YOU! YOU'RE the one<br/>wearin' the stupid dress with the ribbons everybody can<br/>see!"<p>Genma Saotome nodded towards the girl who clearly looked<br/>like a girl, "That's right."<p>Soun Tendou nodded as well, "Indeed."<p>Kane-chan cried, "It's Kasumi's idea!"<p>Ranma-chan crossed her arms under her chest, "And the old<br/>priestess thinks the goddess likes the way Kasumi<br/>thinks."<p>Kane-chan screamed, "Just because somebody forces me into<br/>wearing something I don't want doesn't make me a girl!"<p>Soun Tendou said, "Dear me, Akane does have a problem,<br/>doesn't she?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki looked across the table at the guy who thought he<br/>was the living embodiment of the samurai spirit and his<br/>cute, little dolly. He was wiping the food particles off<br/>of his face. "You must really have a thing for Ranma, eh,<br/>Kuno?"<p>Nabiki did a quick calculation in her head. "I just<br/>happen to have some photos."<p>Kuno cried, "Photos!"<p>Nabiki teased, "Want to see them?"<p>Kuno's eyes shifted as he tried to do his own<br/>calculations. "Hmph!" He and he tossed his head back,<br/>trying to look nonchalant about the matter. "Well, I..."<p>Nabiki interrupted the act, "Tell you what. Buy me some<br/>spaghetti, and I MIGHT let you see them."<p>Kuno's fist hit the table, "This is torture!"<p>Nabiki made ready to "break off" the transaction, "Hey!<br/>If you don't want to see them."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>Kane-chan told them all, "All *I* have to do is find some<br/>cool water, and *I* won't be a girl!" And he leaped down<br/>the stairs.<p>Kane-chan went past the surprised elder Saotome and for<br/>Ranma-chan. Ranma reflexively "saved" the girl. In Ranma-<br/>chan's arms, Kane-chan used her Vine-Clinging-on-a-Statue<br/>technique to glomp on.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "What'd you do that for!"<p>Kane-chan "This is a more interesting way to find water.<br/>You'll help me, won't you, Ranma?" Wide-eye flutter.<p>Genma Saotome told Ranma to, "Hold her, son! I'll knock<br/>her off!" He reared up his had to do just that.<p>Her arms trapped, Ranma-chan ran down the stairs: "Geez,<br/>Pop! Whatever happened to "not hittin' girls"!"<p>Genma answered, "But she's-"<p>Suddenly, close behind him: "GEN-MA!"<p>Genma turned and saw a giant demon's head at his<br/>shoulder. Demon Head Soun Tendou cried, "How DARE you<br/>threaten to strike Akane, the very image of my dear<br/>wife!"<p>His fingers and hands up in a Takahashi, Genma grinned<br/>nervously, "Can't we talk this out? (Heh, heh)"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nearer the top of the stairs, Kasumi cried, "Oh, my! How<br/>rude of Father to become a demon on temple grounds.<br/>Forgive him, Mrs. Priestess."<p>The old priestess said, "I sense no demon, so no offense<br/>is taken. But allow me to continue...The corset shiatsu<br/>is just to plant the idea within young Ranma that your,<br/>uh, sibling won the favor of the goddess. But humans are<br/>not logical. If Ranma continues to feel the corset, she<br/>will chafe under it and seek to free herself."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, I see! That is why the corset will come<br/>off soon."<p>The old priestess said, "Yes. Ranma will have nothing to<br/>PHYSICALLY rebel against. THAT combined with the tether<br/>of the red string will bind her far more securely."<p>Kasumi asked, "Oh, my, then, Ranma will be the girl?"<p>The old woman said, "Only if she passes the tests."<p>Kasumi asked, "Tests?"<p>The old woman said, "Both Ranma and Kaneda have can<br/>become female. It is their Karma. It now becomes a matter<br/>of which one is better suited to be the woman. In a word,<br/>ENDURE. Which one can endure what a woman goes through."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki had taken Kuno next door in the "Shopping Plaza"<br/>to a Western-style restaurant that served spaghetti.<p>Unlike sweet dumplings, pasta wasn't something she had<br/>had very often, "Mmm!"<p>But she was there on business. With her mouth still full,<br/>she laid five photos face up on the table, "Here's the<br/>deal: One thousand yen per shot."<p>When Kuno saw what was on them, he cried, "Whoh, hoa!"<br/>Akane Saotome was out in her yellow kempo-gi. She was<br/>working out in the arena in front of the dojo. Besides a<br/>sweaty, frowning profile, she was high-kicking, lifting<br/>dumbbells, hitting a punching bag, and demolishing some<br/>cinderblocks. "What strength! What power! I'll take<br/>them," he said taking a 5,000-yen note from the pocket<br/>inside his kendo-gi shirt where he kept his walking-<br/>around money.<p>Picking the photos up, he admired them, She is truly a<br/>tigress among kittens. A truly capable girl. Then he<br/>thought to ask, "How did you obtain these objets d'arte<br/>martiale?"<p>Nabiki was back to enjoying her spaghetti, "She is<br/>engaged to a Tendou. KEI Tendou."<p>Kuno got excited in a way different from when he viewed<br/>the photos, "You KNOW how to get in touch with Akane<br/>Saotome!"<p>Nabiki smiled to herself; her plan was falling back into<br/>place, "5,000-yen more for "The Very Tragic Tale of Kei<br/>and Akane."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>Genma Saotome took off down the stairs yelling; Ranma-<br/>chan was close behind him; Kane-chan was still wrapped<br/>around Ranma's arms. Demon Head Soun Tendou was licking<br/>at their heels, giving them the evil eye.<p>Kasumi was barely aware of what was going on further down<br/>the long stairway. She said, "Oh, my! I seem to have<br/>given Akane the head start at being the girl."<p>The waddling old woman assured her, "Though little girls<br/>may think differently, the race is not won by the<br/>swiftest. Each develops at their own pace. It is all a<br/>matter of growth spurts."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, I am confused. Akane and Ranma<br/>appear to be past their major growth spurts. Weren't we<br/>talking about something other than..." she became modest,<br/>"...physical development?"<p>The old woman smiled, "Then think of it as a phase. They<br/>are currently in a...tomboy phase. Surely you have had a<br/>friend or two growing up like that who quite rapidly took<br/>to being a woman?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Kuno, of course, had to protest that "one as pure of<br/>heart as I does not stoop to entertain hearsay rumor."<br/>After making his expected speech, he gave Nabiki the<br/>5,000-yen. She almost added 1,000 as an added tax for<br/>having to pretend to listen to his speech.<p>Meanwhile, Nabiki had ordered extra garlicky Italian<br/>bread with a raw onion on the side. She took a bite of<br/>the bread and then cut the onion, "It all started with<br/>the clan feud between the Fukuoka Tendous and Saotomes."<br/>She took another bite of the garlicky bread, waiting for<br/>him to react. He didn't. "Fukuoka is the province of the<br/>Main Island of Japan closest to the Okinawa Islands(?)."<p>Kuno wrinkled his nose, "Okinawa: The Still of Japanese<br/>Martial Arts! So that is how the two families came by<br/>their interest in the fowl practice that reeks of the<br/>peasant class." Then his mind wondered to another<br/>thought, "Do you think Fukuoka is where fuku/girls'<br/>sailor suits got started?"<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes, and continued with her story,<br/>"The feud is SO ancient the elders of the clans finally<br/>realized that nobody could remember how it started. In an<br/>attempt to make peace, they agreed to as many arranged<br/>marriages between clan members as they could find<br/>candidates."<p>Kuno's eyes began to water, "..."Arranged marriages"!<br/>They are the stuff that tragic legends are made from.<br/>Even the great English bard Shakespeare wrote of their<br/>comedic tragedy."<p>Nabiki continued to cut the onion. That her own eyes were<br/>a bit moist helped her presentation. "That is the<br/>problem. The only potential couple available is Kei and<br/>Akane."<p>Kuno wept for them, "But THEY love others, and not one<br/>another. How very archetypal!"<p>Nabiki said, "Actually, they DO love each other. At least<br/>Akane loves Kei. But Kei refuses to be agree to anything<br/>until his birthright is recognized."<p>Kuno could relate to birthrights; he said with passion,<br/>"The man is man enough there! And what is the heritage<br/>that has been ripped from his soul!"<p>Nabiki set down her fork and knife and tried to look<br/>solemn. "Kei wishes to reclaim his clan name. You see Kei<br/>Tendou was born a Saotome."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>Demon Head Soun Tendou was too out of practice for Ranma-<br/>chan's speed; he was now meters behind her.<p>Kane-chan yelled, "Why are you running from Dad! Are<br/>you afraid of him?"<p>Ranma-chan told her, "NO! I'm not afraid of a stupid<br/>projection technique!" But she may have protested too<br/>much. "I'm looking for some water so I can get you off of<br/>me!"<p>Kane-chan smiled, "You don't think that'll make me even<br/>stronger?"<p>Ranma-chan said back, "It'll also make you longer! But<br/>I'm bettin' girls cling better 'n guys! It's the way<br/>they're built!"<p>Kane-chan wondered if she wasn't right. KANEDA-KUN had<br/>never done the Cling on anybody.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Still at the Italian food franchise, Kuno repeated, "Kei<br/>Tendou wishes to be recognized as a Saotome?" He coughed<br/>briefly on the fumes he'd sucked in.<p>Nabiki thought, There! Let "Kei Tendou" say he's really<br/>a Saotome: A lot of good that ought to do him.<p>Kuno was confused. That was nothing new for him, but this<br/>time he allowed himself to show it. "If he is truly a Kei<br/>Saotome, how did he become a Tendou?"<p>Nabiki came to what she thought was the most ingenious<br/>part of her story, "What is a feud of honor if there is<br/>nobody left to carry the tradition forward? Seeing that<br/>the head of the Tendou clan's direct line had no son, the<br/>head of the clan Saotome clan, out of a respect born of a<br/>lifetime of rivalry, allowed the adoption of Kei."<p>She then made a show of feminine conflict by looking<br/>away. "...And Akane was given to the Saotomes in<br/>exchange." It was now time to make the story MORE<br/>believable; she looked straight at Kuno-baby, "Akane-<br/>Plus a prized relic that the Saotomes wanted." Simply<br/>exchanging a girl for a boy wasn't considered a fair<br/>trade by old-line traditionalists (including, she was<br/>sure, Kuno). It was the relic that would be considered<br/>the main part of the deal.<p>Kuno thought he understood. "Then, then Akane Saotome is<br/>by blood Akane Tendou?" The plot was complicated but not<br/>convoluted. In fact it was the opposite of "Romeo and<br/>Juliet" in that the hero was not trying to DENY his<br/>family, but...As he was pondering this, he something else<br/>bubbled up from the depths of his mind, "WHAT prized<br/>relic?"<p>Nabiki knew Kuno collected antiques. And nothing was more<br/>tempting to him than a relic. This was yet another<br/>business opportunity. "They wouldn't tell me. It's too<br/>valuable to let anybody know what it is or where they hid<br/>it." How long it would be 'hidden' would depend on how<br/>much she could get the bidding up. And "mysterious" was<br/>always a draw.<p>Nabiki said, "Akane knows as much about the relic as Kei.<br/>Would you consider giving the doll to her?"<p>Kuno said, "But of course! I asked about conveying my<br/>gift to the Pig-tailed Ranma Saotome as my intercessor<br/>because I did not know how to reach Akane Saotome."<br/>Though, now that he thought of it, by the two girls<br/>having the same family name, there HAD been a chance one<br/>knew the other.<p>Nabiki said, "I could. But I have a better person in<br/>mind."<p>Kuno asked, rising from the booth's bench, "You know of a<br/>person whose word can reach my lady Akane's heart!"<p>Nabiki smiled, "Ice cream, please!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>+<br/>Kasumi and the old priestess continued on their walk down<br/>the stairs. "Oh, my! So, you're advising I should<br/>encourage BOTH of them to explore their feminine side?"<p>The old woman said, "Until such time as your heart tells<br/>you otherwise. I believe your heart is pure. It will know<br/>when the answer to this puzzle is reached. But until you<br/>are sure, my advice is, yes."<p>Kasumi was still concerned, "Oh, my, what a<br/>responsibility. But couldn't I do more harm than good to<br/>the one who will not be the girl?"<p>The waddling old woman asked, "How many wives wish their<br/>husbands had an understanding of what they must go<br/>through?" She turned away, her hands behind her back,<br/>"But if he is any kind of man, he will survive. If need<br/>be, there are certain methods that can make the<br/>distinctions black and white, on and off, male and<br/>female." She looked down at Ranma-chan leaping the last<br/>eight steps of the stairway with Kane-chan. "Perhaps the<br/>methods have already been employed." She became very<br/>serious, "THEN time as a woman would correct any<br/>misconceptions that have occurred."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan reached the park-like swath of grass looking<br/>for water. She made her decision, "Water is downhill."<p>Kane-chan commented, "With us, not necessarily."<p>The Demon Head cried, "I caught you!"<p>Ranma-chan gave a reaction. Kane-chan, rather than test a<br/>girl's ability to stretch, let go. This caused her to be<br/>thrown up into the air.<p>Kane-chan aimed for Mr. Demon Head.<p>It disappeared and Soun Tendou cried, "I caught you" as<br/>he held her in his arms.<p>Tired, he did drop to his knees, though. Kane-chan yelled<br/>at her dad, "Why did you do that for! She was about to<br/>get me wet!"<p>Soun Tendou wept, "Oh, lovely Akane! Tell me you do not<br/>entertain thoughts about women!"<p>Kane-chan pushed herself free from him, "I'm telling you:<br/>The second to the last thing I want to be is a pervert-<br/>girl!"<p>Soun Tendou's crying eased as he asked, "Then you ARE<br/>interested in men?"<p>Kane-chan told him, "And that's the LAST thing I want to<br/>be!"<p>Soun Tendou stopped crying altogether. He had to think;<br/>"What's left?"<p>Kane-chan meanwhile noticed, "Ranma's getting away!"<p>Soun watched her run after the leaping redhead. "She<br/>likes women who dress like men?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki was eating a two-scoop ice cream cone at another<br/>restaurant in the "Shopping Plaza". "To give a gift of<br/>your affection for Akane, you must first give it to Kei."<p>Kuno cried, "What! But I have no affection for him!"<p>Nabiki licked on her cone, and said, "Kei IS Akane's<br/>fiance. It would be more honorable to confront him with<br/>your intentions?"<p>Kuno nodded, "Yes; confront!" and reached for his wooden<br/>sword...that he was uncharacteristically without.<p>Nabiki coldly told him, "You won't have to confront him<br/>that way, Kuno." She explained to the moron, "Kei says he<br/>doesn't want to be engaged to Akane. He should give you<br/>his blessing. He will even HELP you win her."...until he<br/>finally understands he could lose her. Then, if he has<br/>any feelings for Kane-chan, they will finally be forced<br/>out in the open. And if Kei does reject her..."Akane will<br/>be so hurt and angry she'll GIVE you the relic as her<br/>dowry."<p>Kuno said, "But of course! My gift would have more<br/>meaning if Kei Tendou were the agent of my love! It then<br/>symbolizes betrayal. -And Akane would come to me on the<br/>rebound!" And it will be out of love and respect that<br/>she shall do what all women must do for their man, and<br/>make that ultimate sacrifice!<p>Nabiki was satisfied, "Then you will forget about Ranma?"<br/>And if Kei DOES reject Akane, (thanks to Part B of<br/>Nabiki's Master Plan) Ranma would have little choice but<br/>be Kaneda's ... and with Kuno out of the running.<p>Kuno said, "Who says I have to forget her?"<p>Nabiki bit into her cone, "Then you are going to two-time<br/>Akane?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>Kane-chan followed Ranma-chan as best she could. It was<br/>hard to do when Ranma was taking the rooftop express and<br/>she was hoofing it. At least Kane-chan wasn't wearing<br/>anything with heels. (And a swishy skirt didn't hurt.)<p>Then in a narrow ally Kane-chan found her way blocked.<p>By Ranma's father: "Now that we are alone, it is time to<br/>have a discussion." He rubbed the spot on his head that<br/>Kaneda had hammered yesterday morning.<p>Kane-chan eyed the man; so far the only threat came from<br/>the tone of his voice. She made no moves, but prepared<br/>herself for an attack. "There's nothing more to discuss<br/>until the marriage contract. If Ranma's going to marry<br/>any Tendou, it's going to be me."<p>Saotome told her, "Is that so! I'll have you know I<br/>raised Ranma to be a man among men. He'd rather commit<br/>seppuku than be less!"<p>Kane-chan thought, This guy's a real jerk! He'd rather<br/>see a dead son, than a live daughter! "That sounds like<br/>a CHALLENGE: If you want me to prove how much of a man *I*<br/>am, I'm willing to risk suicide!"<p>Saotome's eyes shifted around as if he tried to decide<br/>whether that was a good idea or not. Kane-chan then<br/>added, "But instead of Ranma, it'll be between YOU and<br/>me!"<p>Saotome decided that having a suicide contest WAS a bad<br/>idea: "But this is between you and-"<p>Splash!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi and the old priestess had reached the bottom of<br/>the stairs and were preparing to make their good-byes.<br/>But Kasumi had a thought, "Oh, my! What if BOTH Kaneda<br/>and Ranma are unable to become the woman? What will<br/>happen to their relationship, then?"<p>The old priestess told her, "There are two parts to the<br/>omamori you have in your purse. The first is the red<br/>string."<p>Kasumi nodded, "I am to sew pieces of the red string into<br/>their clothing. That will keep them magically tied to<br/>each other."<p>The old priestess said, "The second is the fabric<br/>rectangle the prayer is written on. It was originally<br/>created for Akane, but it can apply to Ranma, as well,<br/>when you pray over it. The only question is where to<br/>place it."<p>Kasumi asked, "It doesn't go back under Kaneda's<br/>mattress?"<p>The old priestess explained, "Goodness, no! It has to be<br/>some place that BOTH own, or nobody owns. And it has to<br/>have Yin."<p>Kasumi didn't blink as she pondered, "Yin? As in the<br/>feminine principle?"<p>The old priestess nodded solemnly, "We ARE encouraging<br/>them to be more feminine. As for what has Yin, how much<br/>do you know about Feng Shui?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki eyed Kuno's too cute, girl doll. Right now, the<br/>thing could go to both Akane and Ranma, or neither. If<br/>she didn't do something her plans for Ranma-chan were<br/>going to unravel. But with a plan as finely meshed as<br/>hers, snags along the way had to be expected.<p>She had moved them to a coffee shop. Coffee was something<br/>else she normally didn't get at home. "Since "they are so<br/>dear to you, you cannot bear to part with them", I WILL<br/>offer you the photos I took of Ranma. 2,000-yen per<br/>shot."<p>Kuno protested, "But it only cost 1,000 a photo of-"<p>Nabiki spread the photos out on the bar in front of the<br/>shop's window.<p>Kuno marveled at the five different shots of Ranma-chan<br/>undressed (and one where she WAS undressing!). "She's,<br/>so..." his greedy hands them up, "unashamed before the<br/>camera." They weren't a product of his fevered fantasies.<p>Nabiki grinned, "Unashamed is a good word for her. You'd<br/>almost think she was a boy."<p>Kuno, still staring lustfully at the photos, said, "This<br/>is proof that Ranma IS no boy!" Tears began to blur his<br/>vision, "ONLY an utter knave like Kaneda Tendou would<br/>deny that!"<p>When Nabiki went to take the photos back, Kuno quickly<br/>gave her the 10,000-yen.<p>Nabiki said, "Ignoring the fact that you just insulted my<br/>brother, I can tell you what to give Ranma. That doll<br/>will NOT make the cut with her, Kuno."<p>Kuno looked at the doll, "But I wished to use it to<br/>release the femininity that has been so cruelly locked<br/>away in her."<p>Nabiki gave him a broad, calculating smile, "You need to<br/>be more direct with Ranma. When it comes to things<br/>feminine, you have to hit Ranma over the head with the<br/>metaphorical two-by-four." She tried to keep her face<br/>from looking too cleaver, "Ranma has no wardrobe. If she<br/>is to start being feminine, she has to start LOOKING<br/>feminine."<p>Kuno looked at the doll's old-fashioned long pink dress<br/>with the frilly apron. "A lady DOES need a complete<br/>assortment of attire for all occasions. Organdy dresses,<br/>satin gowns, silken peignoirs..."<p>Nabiki suggested, "Take a look at those photos, again.<br/>Surely you'd prefer to see Ranma in more, revealing<br/>things?"<p>Kuno said, "As with the photos, a lady's modesty is best<br/>assaulted away from the public eye. For somebody as pure<br/>of heart as I, it is unthinkable expose a lady to the<br/>lascivious leers of the rabble."<p>Nabiki said, "Ranma is no lady. And neither are most<br/>girls, today."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>#<br/>The panda growled in frustration!<p>Ranma-chan dropped down from the roof of one of the<br/>buildings that lined the narrow ally. She landed between<br/>the animal and Kane-chan.<p>Tossing away the pail of water she'd found, she yelled at<br/>the beast, "Since when do you try and fight my battles<br/>for me, Old Man! Stay out of this, or I'll be your<br/>kaishaku myself! Because I KNOW you'd chicken out killing<br/>yourself!"<p>Kane-chan asked, "What about me? Do you think *I* have the<br/>guts!"<p>Ranma-chan looked over her shoulder, and snorted, "Hmmph!<br/>Girls do seppuku in the neck, not the stomach, stupid."<br/>She had definite ideas about what should remain purely<br/>adult male.<p>Kane-chan cried, "I'd do the full seppuku ritual if it<br/>would SHOW you I AM a man!"<p>Ranma-chan looked and walked away, "A real man'd only<br/>commit suicide for honor."<p>Kane-chan stomped her foot forward, demanding, "Promise<br/>me you'll be my kaishaku!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Why! You plan on showing your honor by<br/>NOT going through with it?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>$<br/>Nabiki said, "Oh, one final thing, Kuno. The clans of<br/>Fukuoka take the traditional ways seriously. If you're<br/>going to give anything to one of their females, you're<br/>going to have to first run it by her male kin."<p>Kuno nodded; he could understand about keeping up the<br/>appearance of propriety. He WAS raised to have a pure<br/>heart. "I will show my gift to Ranma Saotome to her<br/>father."<p>Nabiki sounded scornful, "What are you thinking, Kuno?<br/>You're about to declare your intentions for a man's<br/>woman. You're THEN going to do the same for yet another<br/>man's fiancee. To the father who ARRANGED her<br/>engagement."<p>His eyes opened, Kuno said, "I see... Two-timing CAN<br/>complicate matters of the heart."<p>Nabiki told him, "What you need is an advocate within<br/>their ranks."<p>Kuno asked, "And that would be?..." Then he got it:<br/>"Another Saotome!"<p>Nabiki's smile was almost a gloat, "Right: Kei is really<br/>a Saotome." Kuno kept coming back for more from Kaneda,<br/>but even HE isn't masochist enough to date Ranma after<br/>"Kei" gets through with him. And Kaneda.<p>Nabiki, for all her cunning, did not know about the Kuno<br/>curse.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>+<br/>After Kasumi had said sayonara and was walking away, the<br/>old priestess called out, "Do not worry if things do not<br/>look as if they are not going as planned! The goddess of<br/>reason knows reason is not the way of humans."<p>The End of this chapter<br/>[Summary of Kasumi's part: Ranma doesn't know about the<br/>magic red string, so she thinks it's the invisible corset<br/>that binds her to Kaneda. What she doesn't know (or feel)<br/>she can't break. Dissonance will also sabotage her<br/>efforts to free herself. BUT the rectangle with the<br/>written pray when placed in the doll will give either<br/>Ranma OR Kaneda an equal chance at being the girl. One<br/>WILL pass the tests.]<p>[Summary of Nabiki's part: Kei and Akane were exchanged<br/>at birth. Kei would rather be a Saotome. Kei thinks he<br/>wants to get rid of Akane. But Kuno not only wants Kei's<br/>help to get Akane, but Ranma.]<p>[Summary of the Two Fathers: Soun thinks Akane likes<br/>butch girls. Genma thinks Kaneda will challenge him to a<br/>suicide contest if he makes too much trouble.]
