</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>17: Knocked up? Getting into Her Bloomers<p>Nude among less than half-dressed girls, Ranma-chan<br/>kneeled unladylike before the remains of her silk,<br/>Chinese clothes. "These, these are the only clothes like<br/>this I have!"<p>One sympathetic soul in the locker room asked, "How can<br/>that be?" She also wondered how the redhead's waist<br/>could be so unnaturally small.<p>Another girl without a bra nudged her, and whispered,<br/>"Haven't you HEARD? This is Ranma Saotome! You know:<br/>Pigtail, red hair?"<p>More than one girl gasped, "The one brainwashed..."/<br/>"...abused..."/ "...tortured by her father!"/ "-The<br/>woman-hater!"/ ("Is that why she looks like she's<br/>wearing an invisible corset?")<p>One with a bra said, "The one Nabiki told us about?"/<br/>"The one she's arranging a birthday party for-?"/<br/>"Quiet! It's supposed to be a surprise."<p>Distraught, Ranma-chan picked up the clothes in her<br/>hands; she didn't care they were clammy and damp, "I can<br/>only have what I can carry. We don't have much money."<br/>She pressed the cold, wet material to her exposed bosom,<br/>"I had to fight Pop to keep THESE!"<p>The sympathetic soul with the large bare boobs said, "Aw,<br/>you poor girl!"<p>More than one obviously female said, "Her father is<br/>cruel..."/ "...and unusual!"/ "He needs to be<br/>punished!"/ "The woman-hater!"/ ("Why would a man<br/>like that want her to wear an invisible corset?")<p>But more common sense asked, "But Ranma's dad is a<br/>martial artist. What can WE do Ranma can't do?"<p>The locker room door opened, and the girls of sixth<br/>period P.E. saw the sempais of fifth. "What's going on?"/<br/>"Why are you girls still here?"/ "What girl's having a<br/>crisis this time?"/ "Anything interesting this time?"<p>One girl with a red bow in her dark brown hair had made<br/>her way through the crowd outside far enough to see,<br/>"Ranma!" Behind Sayuri, still lost behind the others,<br/>Yuka asked, "Ranma? SHE'S the one with the crisis?"<p>The girls in the locker room saw that it was time to get<br/>dressed. A girl putting on her school blouse told them,<br/>"I'll say. She says she'd rather die than go without her<br/>special clothes."<p>Girls from Ranma's class asked, " "Special clothes"?"/<br/>"Is that her attitude?"/ "Is that why can't she wear a<br/>uniform like the rest of us?" / "Because it wouldn't<br/>make her "special"?"/ "(If I had a waist like that I<br/>wouldn't hide it in baggy clothes.")/ "If that's her<br/>attitude, I don't know if I WANT to go to her birthday<br/>party."/ "Maybe she's like Yuumei, and thinks she's too<br/>good to exercise with us."<p>"Ranma's not like that!" Sayuri told them, pushing her<br/>way in. "Didn't you hear Yuka tell you how Ranma's<br/>efemininating Dad did to her?"<p>(Yuka pleaded, "Let me through, please! I'm with them!")<p>A girl stepping into her blue jumper wondered, "<br/>"Efemininating"? Is that a word?"<p>Sayuri like all of the others had gym bags, "If there can<br/>be a word like "emasculating", why shouldn't there be a<br/>female equivalent?"<p>A girl zipping up her dress's back with practiced hands<br/>answered, "Because people are more concerned with guys<br/>not acting like guys than vice versa?"<p>A girl who pulled up a white sock answered, "Because a<br/>girl who acted like a guy had better be tougher than a<br/>guy?"<p>A girl who laced up a shoe added, "If she isn't, they'll<br/>do to her what they do guys who aren't GUY enough!"<p>A girl who shouldered a sports bag said, "They'll keep at<br/>her until SHE starts acting like a girl."<p>Yuka had finally been allowed to see Ranma-chan, "Is that<br/>why she acts like she does! Like, uh..."<p>Sayuri put her bag down and kneeled beside Ranma-chan,<br/>"Like "a caricature of a guy martial artist"? Of course<br/>it is!" She put an arm around her bare shoulders, "Ranma-<br/>chan acts the way she does because NOBODY has given her a<br/>chance to be anything else."<p>Ranma-chan shook the offending arm off, her mind<br/>elsewhere, "I won these clothes in a battle with a<br/>Chinese martial artist who laughed at me for being a girl<br/>in my kempo-gi!"<p>Yuka wanted to kneel down on the other side of Ranma-<br/>chan. But her upperclasswomen from the previous class<br/>were all ready and wanted out the door. Yuka had to stand<br/>in front of Ranma. Looking at the girl down in the raw,<br/>she asked, "Is that why those things are so important to<br/>you, Ranchan?"<p>Sayuri, too, found she had to make way for them. "It's<br/>like they said; these Chinese clothes were special<br/>because they were her trophy. They were a symbol that she<br/>WAS guy enough."<p>The one who'd mentioned Nabiki looked down at the<br/>redhead's above average chichis, "A girl with THOSE<br/>statistics would need a lot to assure herself she's<br/>really a guy."<p>Ranma-chan looked forlornly at the wet shreds in her pink<br/>girlish lap with hips, "I need Chinese clothes to keep<br/>from havin' a kid."<p>This was a slap in the face of the martial arts persona<br/>of Ranma Sayuri had been building, "You, you think<br/>Chinese clothes will keep you from becoming pregnant?"<p>That brought comment from both sets of girls, "Now that's<br/>just plain stupid."/ "Wait a minute! I've heard about<br/>the ancient wisdom of the Chinese. Ranma went there to<br/>learn it!"/ "And "Chinese clothes will keep a girl from<br/>getting knocked up"? Unh, hunh."/ "Okay, that is plain<br/>stupid. I'm out of here."/ "We, two by two."<p>The girls in the hall made room to let those of 2-E get<br/>by, and still follow what was happening: "Wow! How<br/>ignorant of girls did her daddy keep her?"/ "I know<br/>Japanese parents don't like to talk about sex. But look<br/>around at what is sold!"/ "They even give out copies of<br/>the "Karma Sutra" to girls."/ "That's how TO have sex.<br/>NOT how keep from getting its aftereffect!"/ "As we<br/>speak, decades after its invention, Japan still hasn't<br/>even legalized the birth control pill, yet!"/ "Right.<br/>The excuse is it'll make girls WANT to have more sex."/<br/>"Meanwhile the guys are given the message it's manly to<br/>"conquer" girls."/ "Right: "Don't take "no" for an<br/>answer"."/ "Humph! I'll bet WE'LL only get OUR pill<br/>when there's a pill the GUYS want legal!" By now those<br/>outside were moving into the locker room and were<br/>starting to take their clothes off.<p>Sayuri tried to lift the focused redhead up off the<br/>floor, "Come on; move over to the bench on the wall<br/>beside the door."<p>Yuka joined her, "You need to put SOMETHING on, Ranchan.<br/>Or you just MIGHT get with child."<p>Sayuri asked, "Yuka, how much do YOU know about<br/>reproduction?"<p>Yuka said, "That's what Daddums tells me! Keep your<br/>clothes on and-"<p>One girl stepping out of her dress suggested, "If Ranma's<br/>not feeling right, she should see the nurse."<p>Another getting out of her blouse and slip at once said,<br/>"What can the nurse do? Give her a hot compress?"<p>Ranma came to her feet, so fast she boobs took on a life<br/>of their own, "Nothing hot!" she panicked. "I CAN'T<br/>become a guy now! I have to stay a girl!"<p>One girl reaching around to unhook her bra said, "I wish<br/>I could become a guy right now. Even with a sports bra,<br/>these can be a pain at P.E.!"<p>A smaller B cup opened her front fastening bra, "Ranma,<br/>going to the nurse is your excuse out of P.E.!"<p>A C pulling her sports bra past her neck said, "And how<br/>is she going to get to the nurse's undressed like that?"<p>One who stepping out of her panties laughed, "Maybe the<br/>nurse can examine her here: Ranma's stripped for a total<br/>physical examination!"<p>Sayuri had almost gently pulled Ranma-chan over to the<br/>bench, she told the others, "Ranma's a martial ARTIST!<br/>She LIKES things like physical exertion!"<p>The words clicked with Ranma-chan, "That's right! I'll<br/>stay a girl, but DO physical stuff! That's what I do,<br/>that's what's familiar, that'll take my mind off of this!<br/>I'll lose myself in, in..."<p>...In a body that would NOT let her forget that she was a<br/>girl. Ranma looked past the annoying boobs were the real<br/>enemies, the hips. Those pushed out things affected her<br/>fighting stance by making her knees come in. She would<br/>call it knock-kneed if her center of her weight wasn't in<br/>her belly. THAT, above jiggly fat deposits, both top and<br/>bottom, the soft skin and thin muscles, thick but short<br/>legs, and the annoying entrance between them, THAT above<br/>everything else that screamed in a soprano voice this<br/>wasn't a guy's body is what most nagged at her nerves.<br/>Ranma-chan was bottom-heavy! That should be okay for<br/>somebody trained in the Saotome School of Lower Body<br/>Martial Arts! She actually had MORE thigh muscle as a<br/>girl. -But it WASN'T okay!<p>She had no upper body strength to speak of. None that<br/>compared to what she had as a guy! She had started to<br/>become obsessed with upper body strength. It was what<br/>best defined her guy's body besides the obvious. That<br/>meant guys should punch more kick less. When she had<br/>realized that she come to dwell on the meaning of her<br/>school's name. It was no accident it, and she was named<br/>Saotome ...meaning "Rice paddy Girl".<p>(OF course Ranma's resentful analogy wouldn't let her see<br/>that rice paddy girls did a lot of upper-body work.)<p>...as if for the first time Ranma noticed, "These nipples<br/>are big."<p>Yuka said, "They are hard. You need to warm them, cover<br/>them. -You can have my gym clothes!"<p>Sayuri said, as a friend, "Yuka, your clothes won't fit<br/>over Ranma's figure. MY clothes won't fit over it."<p>Yuka looked at Sayuri, "Yes, yours would. Of course<br/>they'd be a little tight in the bust and a little loose<br/>in the waist."<p>Sayuri said to her, "Be glad I'm not the type to use this<br/>gym bag to hit you with." But she put her bag on the wall<br/>seat, "But the sweatshirt is loose. Other than being a<br/>little long, it should be okay."<p>When the girl took it out, Ranma saw that it wasn't too<br/>bad. The yellow thing with the rolled up short sleeves<br/>didn't look too girly. It was a sweatshirt.<p>Na Chino, the girl with the lousy joke, asked, "What are<br/>your measurements?" She had brought a pair of buruma from<br/>her gym bag. She was wearing another pair under her dress<br/>instead of panties, as well as another sports bra.<p>Ranma-chan said, "Measurements?" She was about to tell<br/>them, but looked down again at her dharma drum figure.<br/>She covered her boobs with an arm, "I don't know!"<p>There was commentary on that, "She doesn't know?"/ "If<br/>*I* had a waist like that, I'd want EVERYBODY to know its<br/>size."/ "Men! That father of hers really HAS kept her<br/>in the dark."/ "Oh, come on; it means she was never<br/>interested to know in the first place."/ "Only<br/>because she knew her the woman-figures wouldn't please<br/>her woman-hater father."...<p>Ranma-chan was pulling the sweatshirt over her pigtail<br/>when: Firm, cool hands touched Ranma's hips. Ranma<br/>startled, and made to spin around into defending position<br/>as arm. But there was no maneuvering room. She stopped<br/>herself from bumping into soft, smooth bodies.<p>Na brought her firm, cool hands over to her own hips. "I<br/>was right, my buruma will fit you." The shorthaired girl<br/>was nearly Ranma's guy-height, but that only made the<br/>girl-widths she shared with Ranma-chan look less<br/>exaggerated.<p>Ranma cried, "Bloomers! No! I can't wear anything like<br/>that!"<p>Na told her, "The only thing we have left to offer you<br/>are our school uniforms. Since this is the last class of<br/>the day, maybe one of the shorter girls-"<p>There was a knock on the locker room door, and little<br/>Miss Hinako announced, "I'm coming in, everybody!" as she<br/>did. "You mischievous girls are TARDY! Mr. Shuaatsuneiga,<br/>your P.E. teacher, asked me to see what the delay was."<br/>She stood in the doorway, forgetting that anybody passing<br/>in the hall...<p>Sayuri put herself in front of the bottomless Ranma,<br/>"There was an accident, and Ranma's clothes became<br/>ruined."<p>Miss Hinako peeked around at the half-covered girl. "Miss<br/>Ranma should go to the office and get a spare uniform."<p>Ranma took Na's buruma and lifted her first leg into the<br/>shorts, "That's okay! These ARE pants. I AM going to be<br/>in P.E. Just like I'm scheduled. ...It IS the last class<br/>of the day." And after that, she'd take care of Kaneda's<br/>for the dirty trick he'd played on her that got her into<br/>this locker room, and which got her INTO girls' gym<br/>clothes! I wonder what kinda boxers he wears.<p>As Ranma-chan pulled up the tight shorts and adjusted the<br/>elastic of the leg openings around her bubble butt, Miss<br/>Hinako made to leave, "This is a mixed P.E. class. I want<br/>all you young ladies to wear protective cups. I don't<br/>want the boys getting naughty ideas."<p>Changing herself, Sayuri commented, "There's something<br/>disturbing about somebody who looks my kid sister's age<br/>saying something like that." Other girls agreed as they<br/>started to leave the locker room for the playing fields.<p>Ranma-chan looked at her crotch, "Girls hafta wear cups,<br/>too?"<p>Na handed Ranma a sports bra, "The kid doesn't know what<br/>she's talking about. These don't have cups."<p>It looked enough like a bra for Ranma-chan to screw up<br/>her face. "No, thanks. I've been doin' alright without<br/>wearin' anything but a shirt."<p>Yuka had on only her buruma, "Doesn't that bother your<br/>big nipples?"<p>Sayuri said, "...Among more weighty items."<p>Na offered Ranma-chan her sports bra again, "See? It's<br/>not lacy, or silky or anything like that. It's really<br/>more like a tight halter top."<p>Ranma-chan still didn't want to touch it. But as she<br/>studied it and the words Na used to describe it, "...like<br/>an undershirt?" She suddenly heard something in the<br/>replay she liked, "Silk! Do you have one in silk?"<p>Na gave up, "A silk sports bra? You have to be kidding."<br/>She reached for her own sweatshirt.<p>Sayuri was down to her rather plain bra, "I bet somebody<br/>does make something like that, though. Somebody always<br/>does."<p>The gossip started among the girls, "Silk! Ranma's<br/>Chinese clothes were silk!"/ "Ooo, and here I thought<br/>Ranma wanted to be thought of as a tomboy..."/ "...a<br/>tough..."/ "...a real guy's girl!"/ There was<br/>giggling: "Ranma has a SILK fetish!"/ "How girly!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>On their way to the playing fields, former gang girl Na<br/>told Ranma, "Silk! It goes against the whole idea of<br/>sports bras."<p>Yuka told Ranma, "There are silk bra and panty sets! I<br/>have some."<p>Sayuri said, "They're made in China. So they're<br/>"Chinese". You probably can get some that have Chinese<br/>prints on them." She was wearing her regular school<br/>blouse.<p>Yuka smiled, "Oh, yes! Lingerie comes in all SORTS of<br/>styles!"<p>Ranma-chan, still tugging at the red bloomers, said, "No!<br/>It'd be another sacrifice of my male dignity." And being<br/>in girls' bloomers surrounded by girls in bloomers was<br/>more than enough already. "There's always a chance I<br/>WON'T get pregnant: All I have to do is stay a girl."<p>Na said, "Staying a girl is how you GET preggers. And if<br/>you're serious about not looking like you're interested<br/>in the idea, you shouldn't have a bikini wax."<p>Sayuri reminded her, "Na, Ranma's a martial artist. Who<br/>would challenge her?"<p>Na told her back, "Another martial artist? Anybody who<br/>can take her unawares? Didn't I hear she's living with<br/>her fiance?"<p>Ranma-chan made a "throat-ripper" claw of her hand, "He<br/>knows better to try any of THAT stuff!" Then she had a<br/>thought, "Wait! How'd I know!"<p>Sayuri said, "You'd know."<p>Na told Ranma-chan, "Give me the word, and I'll<br/>assassinate the ninja sneak attacker for you! I'll mangle<br/>him and tie him up into bows!"<p>Yuka said, "After all, you wouldn't want to do it in your<br/>condition, Ranchan."<p>Sayuri said, "Yuka, where'd you get that idea that women<br/>can't do things like that even late into the third<br/>trimester?"<p>Ranma-chan cry was a vow, "I ain't, and I won't!" She<br/>jogged away from them, "I GOT to DO something and take my<br/>mind off of all of this!" Her unrestrained boobs were<br/>jumping about more than most girls'.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Out on second base, Ranma-chan kept her mind on the ball.<br/>They were tossing around the softball as a warm-up; and<br/>in between her turns, she was stretching and taking<br/>practice swings with an imaginary softball bat. She had<br/>gotten her boobs back under control. Her melons just<br/>suddenly appeared on her, unlike ones that gave a girl<br/>time to learn how to wear them.<p>Ever since Juusenkyo she had had to devote a part of her<br/>body-awareness skills to dealing with those boobs. It<br/>took away that much more attention she could give other<br/>things. That lessened her ability. Or so her resentment<br/>thought. It was all a very strange situation where the<br/>more her subconscious devoted itself to learning to cope<br/>with the strange, new body, the more her conscious was<br/>reminded how alien the body was, and the more numb she<br/>got to it. She used one of her well-trained skills,<br/>ignoring injuries, to counter another.<p>But she was a martial artist. That meant integrating body<br/>and mind, letting her conscious master her subconscious,<br/>not the other way around. The more she allowed the<br/>situation to continue, the worse her skills WOULD<br/>deteriorate.<p>But that meant remaining a girl! That meant practicing in<br/>the very OTHER body. Practicing methodically and<br/>intensely until she knew its all its differences, and how<br/>to put even its obvious weaknesses to use. Practicing<br/>until it became as familiar and comfortable as her real<br/>body. It meant that THIS body WOULD become her other<br/>half. It meant accepting herself as a girl.<p>Experimenting with that idea again, she lowered her<br/>mental barriers down. Again she became aware that<br/>...boobs were what defined a girl's upper body, not<br/>MUSCLES!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Meanwhile while Ranma-chan was outside in short shorts,<br/>Kaneda was in his guys' blue sweat pants and shirt. The<br/>long, red haired guy did his last turn around the steel<br/>high bar and let go. He did a double tuck and an easy<br/>landing on the sand. It was best his class of guys had<br/>seen that day, and they applauded.<p>But Kaneda's eyes returned to, guiltily, on Ranma-chan.<br/>He had run out on her, leaving Ranma alone in the girls'<br/>locker room. But he HADN'T been able to take it! It was a<br/>real problem with him. Every time he was a girl and was<br/>around pretty girls, she just, just had to-escape! No,<br/>don't think about that! You're a guy now, you don't have<br/>to think about it, now! Stay focused on being a guy!<p>Kane-chan had fled in a screaming panic, but what about<br/>Ranma? She didn't look happy. At least she was where she<br/>belonged. With luck and some time, Ranma would become<br/>more comfortable being around girls. And people in<br/>general. Kaneda was (almost) certain of it. Sure Ranma<br/>seemed easy-going, but she didn't volunteer to be around<br/>others. She didn't know how to be anything but an<br/>outsider, so she had to be where the inside could come to<br/>HER.<p>And if there's ONE thing I know about girls, they clump<br/>together more than guys.<p>At least that's the excuse he gave himself when he<br/>plopped down on the ground beside Hiroshi and Daisuke.<p>Hiroshi's eyes, too, were on the cute, redhead in the<br/>revealing buruma, "She must not take the guy-act too<br/>seriously. She shaves her legs."<p>Kaneda knew the truth. He, too, guy and girl, had smooth,<br/>practically hairless bodies. He had thought it was just<br/>part of his genetics. It made him feel self-conscious<br/>around the hairier guys. But even the hairy Japanese were<br/>Asian, and it didn't stand out too much. And his martial<br/>arts reputation MADE them accept that a bald groin was<br/>something he did to improve his technique.<p>Daisuke agreed, "Ranma's got great legs."<p>Kaneda thought, Better hers than mine. Much better<br/>legs. Of course, he was proud of HIS own legs.<p>Hiroshi, still staring, asked, "So, Kaneda, how far have<br/>you gotten with Ranma?"<p>Kaneda, "Hunh?" Ranma had bent over to field a grounder.<br/>The buruma rode up her buttocks.<p>Daisuke, still staring, "Don't play innocent. You're her<br/>fiancée."<p>Hiroshi wanted to know, "So did you do it?"<p>Daisuke put his hand on Kaneda's shoulder, "Yeah, you<br/>know..."<p>While Daisuke held Kaneda down at the shoulder and waist,<br/>Hiroshi got Kaneda in a necklock, "I bet you, di, di -<br/>You know!"<p>Kaneda told them, "Ranma's not ready yet!" Damn! If they<br/>weren't friends, he could easily get out of this.<p>Daisuke knew that; he squeezed, "But YOU are! You say<br/>you're always ready! Aren't you a man!"<p>Hiroshi told him, "Every girl knows the GUY has to make<br/>the moves!"<p>Daisuke told him, "She could be suffering because you're<br/>a coward!"<p>Kaneda stopped struggling for a moment, "She could?"<br/>Ranma-chan DID keep pulling at her buruma.<p>He shook the thought out of his head. "No! Ranma's going<br/>to be my partner! It's going to be her dojo as much as<br/>mine! We're going to build it up together! That means<br/>trust."<p>Their grip slackened. Hiroshi asked, "What kind of talk<br/>is THAT? It's your DAD'S property!"<p>Daisuke said, "You really AREN'T going to be the man of<br/>the family, are you?"<p>Kaneda said, "You take that back!" And broke free of<br/>their embraces. "I WILL be the man!" And he brought out<br/>one of his wooden mallets.<p>Daisuke did back off, "Is that how you prove you're a<br/>man!"<p>Hiroshi was even further back, "It works for me."<p>Suddenly a softball hit the mallet, and was sent with<br/>same force it'd come with back at home plate.<p>Still fighting with herself over whether to allow herself<br/>to experience this other body, Ranma-chan, had been so<br/>distracted her defenses were down. Where it was headed<br/>didn't seem as threatening as it would if she were a guy.<br/>There would be nothing in the way to get hit. And she had<br/>a little extra padding. It would be a hard-knocks lesson.<p>She got the lesson: It hurt a little worse to be hit in<br/>the crotch as a girl! Her knees came together as she<br/>doubled over more out of surprise.<p>Bending forward, she jabbed a boob that was already sore<br/>from before P.E. with the end of the softball bat: That<br/>hurt worse!<p>Overreacting in the now very rejected body, Ranma toppled<br/>over backwards. She kicked the bat with one foot and the<br/>ball with the other.<p>Ranma got up her injury-ignoring skills just in time:<br/>After spinning high in the air, the bat came down hard on<br/>her left cheek.<p>The guys had seen the whole thing.<p>Hiroshi said, "Tomobiki the 13th: This IS an unlucky day<br/>for Ranma, isn't it!"<p>Kaneda leaped to his feet, "RANMA!" While he was<br/>running, he saw that he still had the offending mallet in<br/>his hand. He tossed it. "Ranma, are you okay?"<p>But Ranma's teammates were already crowding around her,<br/>"Oh, the poor GIRL!"/ "What a perfectly dreadful thing<br/>to happen!"/ "Is she, is going to be *swallow*<br/>alright?"/ "She should see a doctor at once!"<p>Sayuri asked, "How ARE you, Ranma?"<p>Ranma-chan knew enough to only touch her burning check,<br/>"I'm okay! I get hurt worse 'n this all the time." But<br/>the red of her angry and embarrassed face matched injury.<p>Yuka gulped, "You do!"<p>Na said, "That evil father of hers!"<p>"He shouldn't hit girls!"/ "His OWN daughter!"/ "In<br/>her FACE!"/ "What if he, like, damaged her for<br/>life?" There were exclamations at that thought.<p>Confused, Ranma-chan took her hand away from her cheek,<br/>"What? Is my face the only thing you care got-"<p>Kaneda found a way between the surrounding girls, "Ranma!<br/>I came as soon as I could!" He scooped the pigtailed girl<br/>up in his big, strong arms. "I'll take you to the<br/>nurse's-"<p>Before he had a chance to get a firm grip on her, Ranma-<br/>chan walloped HIM across the cheek, "Let GO of me,<br/>coward!"<p>Ranma-chan left his arms and fell butt-first to the<br/>ground.<p>Na backed up the nearest girls to allow Kaneda to fly<br/>cleanly over their heads.<p>THIS time Ranma-chan did rub her injury, "I hate bein' a<br/>girl!"<p>Yuka said, "At least you didn't land on your face, you<br/>poor dear."<p>Sayuri assured her, "That's right! You look just fine!"<p>Na told her, "That bruise you're getting on your cheek<br/>will go away in no time!"<p>"You ARE still, kind of, pretty with that cheek."/<br/>"...Just not as cute."<p>It took a second for Ranma-chan to realize which cheek<br/>they were talking about. She took her hand off of her<br/>padded buttock. "What's WITH all this concern about my<br/>face!"<p>There were loud gasps. "You, you don't know!"/ " "A<br/>girl's face is her life"!"/ "How can you NOT know!"/<br/>"That evil father of hers DID take her on a mind trip!"/<br/>"For a girl to have lived THIS long and have not been<br/>told how pretty she is!"/ "It's heartbreaking!"<p>Daisuke kneeled beside her, "I'LL tell you how pretty you<br/>are, Ranma!"<p>Hiroshi was standing beside him, "You are the still the<br/>CUTEST girl-"<p>He fell back onto his own butt when Ranma-chan snapped to<br/>her feet. She yelled at the jerks on the ground, "I<br/>don't WANNA be pretty! And cute's worse!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan and Kaneda had matching gauzes and tapes on<br/>their cheeks. They were walking home on the ground from<br/>school, bookbags in hand. Both of them were also keeping<br/>a wary eye on the other: Ranma because she was still<br/>wearing the yellow sweatshirt and red buruma, and Kaneda<br/>because he was waiting for Ranma-chan to mug him for his<br/>clothes. Kaneda was being very careful. If Kaneda allowed<br/>himself to look at her smooth, shapely legs the way his<br/>libido wanted, Ranma WOULD strip him and turn into a guy.<br/>THEN Ranma-kun would give Kane-chan a taste of the same<br/>medicine! *Shudder*<p>Finally Kaneda tried to ease the tension, "Do you want to<br/>borrow my shirt? I still have an undershirt on. I can<br/>even give you that, since it doesn't matter most times if<br/>guys don't have anything covering his chest." Even as he<br/>was saying it, he knew he was digging his hole deeper and<br/>deeper.<p>Ranma-chan glared, but kept her eyes off of the offender.<br/>"Without pants, it'd still feel like a dress. Right now,<br/>I'm in no mood to feel like I'm wearin' even a sort-of-a-<br/>dress." Heaven knew the bloomers were shaped enough like<br/>panties to make Ranma feel sick. But panties went UNDER<br/>clothes, so she had to keep them outside. (Where they got<br/>stares from every man and woman she passed.)<p>Kaneda explained, "I can't let you have my pants because<br/>my uniform got shredded in the fight in the guys' lav!"<p>Ranma-chan said sourly, "Yeah, I saw the side you<br/>retreated with. Don't you have ANY other underpants than<br/>those polka dot ones?"<p>Kaneda told her, "Tell that to Kasumi! SHE'S the one who<br/>plays dress-up with my girl-form."<p>Ranma-chan snorted, "Hmf! And you're not even man enough<br/>to stand up to HER."<p>That got to Kaneda, "Hey! YOU try telling her what to<br/>do!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "I WILL! Let anybody try to make ME wear<br/>girls' stuff." The vow was hollow right now, though. Even<br/>Ranma knew it; she explained to him, "I can't change<br/>until I have some silk, OKAY! That's the ONLY reason<br/>I'm still a girl, you understand!"<p>Kaneda was puzzled, "I thought it was Chinese clothes you<br/>had to have?"<p>Ranma-chan walked faster, "Which sounds better for a guy<br/>to say?"<p>Kaneda had to admit, "I wouldn't want to admit I felt<br/>like I needed delicates." Again, that didn't help; Ranma<br/>put more distance between them.<p>As Kaneda jogged to catch up, he noticed that up ahead<br/>was a panda sweeping the alleyway called a street in<br/>front of the Dr. Tofu's Clinic. "Hey, isn't that your<br/>dad, Ranma?".<p>Ranma answered, "Geez! What do you think? Hey, Pop!<br/>What're you doin' here?" Perfect! Something else to help<br/>her mood: That no-good doctor had not only put that<br/>invisible corset back on her, he'd then pulled a sneak<br/>attack afterwards that had hypnotized her!<p>The panda raise a paw to greet them, but froze when it<br/>saw what Ranma was wearing.<p>Dr. Tofu was quick to get out the front door, "School<br/>over already?" The man in round glasses and a black gi<br/>said, "Let me introduce Mr. Saotome. He started working<br/>here this afternoon." Their reaction wasn't what he'd<br/>been getting since this afternoon. He asked, "Do<br/>you...know each other?"<p>Ranma-chan glared back black-and-white beast, "Yeah, we<br/>met before." As the panda found its snarl and growl,<br/>Ranma-chan told it back, "Who are YOU to give orders: At<br/>least *I* have clothes on!"<p>Kaneda 'explained' to the Doctor, "You know of the<br/>legends of great warriors? Like Momotaro: He had a dog, a<br/>monkey and a pheasant. The panda is like Ranma's mascot."<p>Dr. Tofu chuckled, "Of course! Now the legends make<br/>perfect sense. -That is why Momotaro's animal companions<br/>were so intelligent!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "I wouldn't say THIS one was so smart."<p>Kaneda said to her, "Just be glad your Dad didn't do what<br/>the Japanese general Yoshitsune did and fall into the<br/>"Spring of Drowned Genghis Kahn"."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Dr. Tofu invited them into his office in the clinic.<br/>While the panda was forced to hold a dish of anpan/sweet<br/>bean buns for the guests, the Doctor pushed hot water out<br/>of a carafe into a serving teapot. He chuckled again,<br/>"You don't say? Ranma's father? Not much of a family<br/>resemblance." He didn't laugh because by now he'd figured<br/>most of the truth out. Though he wasn't sure, yet, what<br/>happened when hot water came into contract with Ranma.<br/>("Ranma" WAS normally a male name, but after meeting Mr.<br/>GENMA Saotome, there was no guarantee that meant<br/>anything.)<p>He turned with the teapot. Of course, the way Ranma was<br/>dressed he wasn't about to spill any hot water on her.<br/>And the redhead sitting in one of his chairs was<br/>obviously in no mood to accept any apologies. It looked<br/>like she had an appetite when she was upset. She was<br/>eating two buns at once, two fisted-style.<p>He set the small china teapot down on the table.<p>Standing beside the Doctor, Kaneda offered, "Here, let me<br/>pour you some tea, Sensei!" Dr. Tofu WAS Kaneda's coach;<br/>the one man he respected above all others.<p>Tofu sensei-like accepted, "How thoughtful. Here's my<br/>cup, Kaneda." He turned back around, "Ranma, whatever<br/>happened to you and Kaneda's faces?"<p>Ranma-chan swallowed the large piece of bun that was<br/>left, "It was in P.E. class. I don't wanna talk about<br/>it." The laser glare was directed, though, at the panda.<p>Without moving the tape or gauze from her face, he looked<br/>at the injury. "I see. I've seen worse," and he chuckled<br/>again, "and more embarrassing."<p>Ranma-chan's face reddened. "This ain't what got<br/>embarrassed." But the fuss they made over it, perversely,<br/>saved her face. But it'd ONLY been because I was a<br/>girl!<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Oh, I see. Well, I can give you something<br/>I am sure will help. I'll let you apply it yourself, if<br/>you like." And he went for it.<p>When the phone rang, he called back, "Mr. Saotome! Will<br/>you get that for me? Thanks!"<p>When the panda picked up the receiver, it "said", BWA-<br/>OW? B'raffu, R'rrura!..."<p>Kaneda took the phone from the unintelligible animal,<br/>"Here! Let me!<p>"Hello, this is the Dr. Tofu's Clinic. Can I ask who's<br/>calling?"<p>Ranma-chan told the idiot animal, "What's the big idea of<br/>picking up the phone when you can't even talk! If<br/>you're gonna be a panda, you should act like a pan-"<br/>Suddenly she felt like the idiot. Change "panda" to<br/>"girl" and-<p>Kaneda said, "Yes, I see. Bye." He hung up the receiver.<br/>He told Ranma-chan, "Come on, Ranma, we have to go."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Hunh? But the doctor's getting me<br/>something." Wait a minute! Why am I trustin' that guy<br/>after what he did!<p>Kaneda told her, "I'm serious, Ranma. That was the storm<br/>warning! Every time she passes by, it's a disaster around<br/>here. The Doctor's patients know to stay away until the<br/>worse is over."<p>Ranma-chan asked, "She? What kind of girl has the power<br/>to-You don't mean our acting principal, that little<br/>brat?"<p>Kaneda said, "No! I don't mean anybody LIKE Miss Hinako!<br/>Miss Hinako only has power over people's Chi energy. The<br/>one I'm talking about has power over people's emotions!"<p>Ranma-chan asked, "You sure you're not exaggerating?"<p>Dr. Tofu came back from his medicine vault, "Here we go,<br/>Ranma! Kaneda! Mr. Cha gets this herbal salve straight<br/>from China. I get many of my harder to find items from<br/>him. He's the herbalist for the Kuno estate."<p>Ranma-chan thought, Another good reason not to trust<br/>this guy. So why do I?<p>But Kaneda accepted it, "Thank you, Dr. Tofu. But we<br/>really should be going, now."<p>Dr. Tofu asked, "Ranma, would you like something in<br/>silk?"<p>Ranma-chan's eye widened, "You KNOW about that!"<p>The Doctor smiled, a bit of relief showing on his face,<br/>"I was guessing: You're not wearing the silk clothes I've<br/>seen you in, and ARE wearing something most young women<br/>don't wear after school hours. You're upset and have the<br/>same curse as Kaneda." He invited her to sit down.<p>Ranma looked at him as if she'd been tricked—again-by<br/>this character. "DO you have any silk?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan was soon wearing black, silk, Chinese pajamas<br/>with red trim, and underneath was a pair of matching<br/>boxer shorts.<p>Dr. Tofu handed her some elastic bands to shorten the<br/>very long legs and sleeves. "These were a present from<br/>Mr. Cha. You can have them, I never wear them." Then he<br/>chuckled again, "He has a matching pair he does wear."<p>Kaneda thought, "His and His" pajamas? I can't believe<br/>Dr. Tofu is like that.<p>But Ranma-chan knew, "I've seen people, both men and<br/>women, wear something that looks like pajamas out in the<br/>streets of China." She almost smiled as she moved on from<br/>the ankles to the sleeves, "These are definitely men's."<p>Dr. Tofu smiled, "So, you ARE male. I have talked with<br/>the priest of the temple that gave you the shiatsu<br/>corset. I'll be glad to remove the visible effects."<p>Ranma-chan looked at the doctor as if may, perhaps, he<br/>WAS somebody he could trust. Until: "Only the "visible"?"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "You are still bound to "Shinpiko" by the<br/>Contest of the Corset." Shinpiko was the Doctor's code<br/>name for Kaneda's secret identity, before it became Akane<br/>Saotome.<p>Kaneda looked at the door, expecting somebody to come in<br/>at any moment, "Are you sure you want to do it, NOW!<br/>Maybe later would be a better time!"<p>Ranma-chan directed her anger at Kaneda, "No, now! You<br/>just want me to keep this stupid wasp waist! It makes me<br/>even look MORE like a girl, like I really DID lose to<br/>you." Then, "Go ahead, Doc!"<p>As Ranma-chan lifted her pajama shirt and let him work on<br/>the nerves of his middle back, Dr. Tofu informed her,<br/>"When a person with your curse changes from a male to a<br/>female, there is always a small chance that the<br/>transformation will not be entirely complete. Now a few<br/>spermatozoon normally will not cause fertilization, but<br/>it has been known to happen."<p>Ranma-chan nodded, "I wasn't told the details, only that<br/>since magic made me like this, magic can keep me from<br/>goin' all the way over! The Chinese guide said I could<br/>become stuck!"<p>Dr. Tofu patted her back, telling her he was done, "Only<br/>for the duration of the pregnancy. But if you are told<br/>silk will keep you from inseminating yourself, it<br/>probably will."<p>Ranma straightened up, " "Probably"!"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Magic is like advanced Chi techniques. It<br/>works ONLY if it's built on a concept the user<br/>understands. It further helps if the one who it's<br/>directed to understands it. THAT is why a martial artist<br/>yells out what technique he is using. He wants to make<br/>the subconscious link. It all has to do with association.<p>"Do YOU understand why silk would prevent you from<br/>getting pregnant?"<p>Ranma-chan firmly nodded, she had to two weeks to burn it<br/>into her mind, and "A silk worm spins its thread to make<br/>a cocoon. It makes a cocoon to change INTO an adult. It's<br/>not sexually mature enough to have kids when it makes its<br/>silk!"<p>Kaneda didn't point out the flaw in the logic. It<br/>would've weakened the magic. Ranma's WISHING it would<br/>work was most of the reason the magic would work. It was<br/>Ranma's greatest "If only" power.<p>Ranma-chan, feeling relieved that she had more than<br/>wishful thinking to keep her from getting stuck as a<br/>knocked-up girl, sat down. The Doctor suggested,<br/>"Alright, Ranma, let's have a look at your cheek, now."<p>Suddenly, no longer worried about Ranma-chan, Kaneda had<br/>to ask, "Doctor! *I* don't wear anything silk!"<p>But from outside the office, Kasumi called, "Hello?"<p>As soon as she opened the door, Dr. Tofu's glasses fogged<br/>up.<p>Kasumi said, "Hello, there! Good afternoon, Doctor Tofu."<p>Tofu's only firm grip on reality was Ranma-chan's head.<br/>He twisted it. Vertebrae snapping out of place were<br/>clearly heard. Ranma-chan gave a warrior's muffled<br/>scream. Kaneda winced!<p>Dr. Tofu smiled like an idiot in the direction of, "Hi,<br/>Kasumi! You're here for the prescription, aren't you!<br/>You'll be sure not to tell the authorities how I deal in<br/>contraband, will you? *Ha, ha!*"<p>Kasumi cried, "Doctor! You weren't supposed to let Kaneda<br/>know!"<p>Dr. Tofu headed for the door, "That's right! I won't let<br/>your brother know you sneak birth control pills in his<br/>food!"<p>The End of this chapter<p>[Note: The birth control pill was finally legalized in<br/>Japan in 1999. It was only allowed because of the arrival<br/>of Viagra. Abortion was one of the highest in the world.<br/>[Yes, the legends about Momotaro and Yoshitsune are real.<br/>The Juusenkyo explanation is mine.<br/>[And, yes, "buruma" is Japanese for "bloomers".]
