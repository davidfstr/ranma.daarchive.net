</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>09: May the Goddess Bless<p>Nabiki said in a serious voice, "As interesting as the<br/>thought of Kaneda getting engaged to Akane is, let alone<br/>married, I don't think you can do that, Uncle Saotome."<p>"Uncle" Saotome said as seriously, "The girl Akane claims<br/>to be a Saotome. I am the eldest Saotome, and therefore<br/>head of the clan. I and the head of the Tendou clan have<br/>agreed to the engagements of Ranma Saotome and Kasumi<br/>Tendou, and Kaneda Tendou and Akane Saotome."<p>Soun Tendou nodded, "That is correct. All in accordance<br/>with the ancient tradition of arranged marriage." He said<br/>it with a renewed purpose in life.<p>Redheaded Kaneda yelled, "In case you didn't notice, this<br/>ISN'T ancient times! Japan has a constitution-With<br/>rights!"<p>Standing behind him, Ranma-kun said, "Yeah!" Then he<br/>asked, "What kind of rights?" He was eating a prawn he'd<br/>taken from the tray of supper dishes he held in the other<br/>hand.<p>Nabiki gave Kaneda a "shut up" look. Little Brother had a<br/>talent for going off on the wrong track, "Actually we<br/>should respect traditions." Kaneda thought, What!<br/>NABIKI said that?<p>Uncle Saotome got a pleased look on his face. He had<br/>gained another ally. The numbers were in his favor.<p>Nabiki said, "If everybody will sit down, I can mediate<br/>this before there is any expensive property damage."<p>A sullen Ranma-kun asked, "Whose side is she on?"<p>Kaneda answered, "Her own."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The two fathers sat on the side of the family table<br/>nearest the still open garden door; the two sons sat<br/>opposite; and Nabiki sat at the end her father had just<br/>left. She said, "Daddy isn't the head of the clan. But<br/>that's not important, since Kaneda and Kasumi ARE his<br/>children. What he says goes up until Great-Granddaddy<br/>gets involved.<p>"And we DON'T want to involve Great-Granddaddy." And Soun<br/>Tendou heartily agreed. Kaneda, though, thought, If all<br/>else fails...<p>Nabiki now addressed "Uncle" Saotome, "You, as Ranma's<br/>father, can also arrange a marriage contract for your<br/>child. But you cannot arrange one for Akane, because..."<br/>She allowed a short pause for dramatic effect. "...you<br/>are not the head of her Saotome clan."<p>Genma Saotome said incredulously, "What!"<p>Her arms crossed on the table, she leaned forward. "Akane<br/>Saotome comes from Fukuoka. Are YOU one of the Fukuoka<br/>Saotome?"<p>Genma Saotome said, " "Fukuoka"? But she's really..."<br/>He looked at his friend Soun sitting next to him. He<br/>remembered Wednesday night, the day he and Ranma arrived<br/>at the Tendous. He had left with Soun. He then spent the<br/>whole night trying to talk some sense to him about Kaneda<br/>wanting to be RANMA'S fiance! Tendou had been a father<br/>first. He said it was understandable Kaneda could be<br/>fooled by a [Genma felt sick] "kawaii" face. He said the<br/>teenager would soon realize the truth about Ranma.<p>But most frustrating of all was when Genma even MENTIONED<br/>that the Kaneda became a girl. Tendou wouldn't hear of<br/>it: Literally! And when Tendou was in his trance, he<br/>COULDN'T hear anything! Worse: When he was brought out of<br/>it, Tendou wouldn't remember anything he didn't WANT to<br/>remember!<p>Fuming almost visibly, Genma Saotome told Nabiki, "If<br/>Akane Saotome WERE from Fukuoka, she would not be my<br/>responsibility."<p>Nabiki smiled as if she'd caught somebody in one of her<br/>snares, "Exactly. The only responsibility you would owe<br/>her is same any Saotome would owe to another Saotome."<p>Ranma-kun said, "*Hmmf* I don't remember any Saotome<br/>helpin' US the times we were in Fukuoka."<p>Soun Tendou the patriarch said, "Still! The social norms<br/>DO say one should extend aide and hospitality to one's<br/>own kind."<p>Nabiki said, "I'm glad to hear you say that, Daddy."<p>That was Kaneda's dad. Sigh! Dad just doesn't think<br/>things through. Then when it comes time to face reality,<br/>he's so afraid of losing face he doesn't. That's probably<br/>how he ended up in that agreement to marry one of his<br/>kids to Saotome's.<p>Kasumi entered the room; she announced, "I think I've<br/>found a temple that can help us."<p>Ranma-kun asked, "Why do we need to go to a temple?"<p>Genma said, "Well, I could use some advice from the<br/>goddess of ideas."<p>Soun said, "Yes, of course. But before we have a formal<br/>engagement ceremony, we need to finalize the marriage<br/>contract."<p>Nabiki said, "I could prepare the contract."<p>Genma told her, "I would prefer to have somebody ELSE<br/>draw it up."<p>Kasumi didn't blink, " "Marriage contract"? Oh, my! Have<br/>things progressed that far, that quickly? Who is to be<br/>the bride?"<p>Her father smiled, "You are, Kasumi! Ranma here has<br/>agreed to be your fiance!"<p>Ranma told him, "I have not! I haven't agreed to get tied<br/>up to anybody, even temporary."<p>Genma smiled wickedly, "And KANEDA will marry Akane. (Ha!<br/>Ha! Ha!)"<p>Kasumi cried, "Oh, My! Poor Kaneda. ...and Akane."<p>Kaneda produced a mallet, "We just established Akane<br/>WON'T marry me!"<p>Kaneda's dad looked disapprovingly at his mallet. (Kaneda<br/>put it under the table.) His dad said, "That hasn't been<br/>established. All that's been determined is that Genma has<br/>little authority to compel her to marry." His tears began<br/>to flow, "But if you truly wish to honor your father, you<br/>WILL marry Akane!"<p>Kaneda groaned. His dad's passionate crying was not an<br/>act. Why do I have to look so much like Mom! I should<br/>just tell him Akane his daughter and... He hung her<br/>head in defeat, And have him go into complete denial. A<br/>daughter-in-law, he can fantasize about. Sick.<p>Kasumi approached her father, "And, you wish me to show<br/>the same deference, as well, Father? And marry, Ranma?"<p>Soun said, trying to compose himself, though no less<br/>ardent, "Yes. I wish to see all of my children in<br/>appropriate marriages. You are from a family with a proud<br/>martial arts tradition. THAT is your station and mission<br/>in life: To carry ON that tradition!"<p>Nabiki refrained from bringing any attention to herself.<p>Kasumi knelt down. Placing her hands in her lap. She said<br/>in a formal manner, "If that is your wish, Father, that<br/>is my wish."<p>Kaneda felt himself being swept up in a whirlpool of<br/>despair. He'd lost Ranma!<p>...And all he got in return was, herself.<p>Kasumi said, "I have only one request of you, Father."<p>Feeling that his fondest wishes WERE coming true, Soun<br/>Tendou said, "Of course, Kasumi, my daughter. Whatever it<br/>is, it is yours."<p>She bowed her head modestly. "I wish to visit the temple<br/>I mentioned. We should consult with the gods. If they<br/>have no objection to the marriage, I will agree to it at<br/>the engagement ceremony."<p>Kaneda did his best to hold back his tears, "Well I won't<br/>agree to it!"<p>Ranma-kun was about to agree with him, when Kaneda's<br/>voice became loud enough to drown all others out: "I<br/>won't agree to anything! Marriage contracts!<br/>Engagements ceremonies! Marriage ceremonies! YOU may<br/>arrange our lives-But WE have to agree to them! You<br/>can't do ANY of those without our consent!"<p>Kasumi said in a quiet voice that broke through her<br/>brother's scream of pain, "And if we do not agree, we<br/>become outcasts without a family."<p>Nabiki was unmoved by anybody in the room, "Kaneda, my<br/>slow-witted sibling. You don't have to go through the<br/>melodramatics. Trust me." Then she smirked, "In the<br/>meantime, why not go with Kasumi to her temple. Humor<br/>her. Who knows, it might even do some good."<p>Kaneda said in torment, "Since when do you believe in the<br/>gods and blessings!"<p>Nabiki said, "I don't. But I do believe in people who<br/>believe in gods and luck." Said the bookie.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda skipped supper. He could not face the people who<br/>had ruined his life-No: DESTROYED his life!<p>He had to hit something!<p>He went to the practice dummy out beside the arena. In<br/>the last light of the day, he punched, chopped, jabbed,<br/>clawed, thrust, and pummeled the sawdust-filled bag<br/>wrapped around the post. When those weren't enough, he<br/>started coming up with new hitting techniques.<p>He was on the verge of bringing out his biggest mallet<br/>when Ranma-kun came out of the house. Out of habit, Ranma<br/>stood by and casually studied Kaneda's abilities. Kaneda<br/>was so upset he didn't care if Ranma DID learn anything.<p>At last Ranma-kun said, "I ate your supper."<p>Kaneda kept striking his opponent who wouldn't fight<br/>back, "Then you lost the challenge. You were supposed<br/>begin eating after me."<p>Ranma-kun asked, "Yeah! And what's the penalty?"<p>Kaneda paused to tell him, "You have to serve-" He<br/>stopped. "Aw, what's the use." And he lashed out with the<br/>Tendou Upper Body Whip Crack: He broke through the canvas<br/>bag, and deep into the sawdust.<p>Kaneda then just stood there, trying to feel something<br/>other than rage. He was not focusing on the Ranma beside<br/>him.<p>Ranma-kun raised his foot. In seemingly one kick, Ranma<br/>splintered the post nearly in two.<p>Bringing his foot back down, Ranma-kun said, "That's<br/>right. You can't make me pay any penalty."<p>Kaneda turned away. The idea of honor was bitter, now.<br/>Ranma and Kasumi were duty-bound to respect the wishes of<br/>their fathers. He walked over to the cinderblocks. He<br/>asked, "Why didn't you beat the stupid fiance-idea out of<br/>me?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "Because I don't want to be hooked to<br/>anybody. Geez! It's bad enough to be on Pop's chain. Like<br/>I need somebody else tellin' me how to live my life!"<p>Kaneda thought, But you do need somebody to tell you how<br/>to live. That's all you've known. Until you decide to<br/>change, you'll be unable to make the boring decisions.<br/>Poor Kasumi: You'll both be stuck in an empty, unhappy<br/>marriage. Each of you will want the other to tell them<br/>what to do when it's beyond what you're good at. But he<br/>said, "So you thought your dad might give up the idea, if<br/>the only one who'd agreed to marry you was me!"<p>Ranma-kun ambled over, "That's about the size of it." He<br/>almost smiled, "AND it got under Pop's skin." A bonus.<br/>But then he had to frown, "Your sister fouled up that<br/>idea."<p>Kaneda smashed the cinderblocks to pieces. He then<br/>straightened up, "I guess it was a doomed idea. Kasumi<br/>was always the weak link. She just likes to please<br/>people." He wished he had the strength to crush the piece<br/>he'd brought up with him. "Especially Dad. You know:<br/>Filial Duty!" Even if it means she looses the one she<br/>really loves.<p>Kaneda called, "Here!" and tossed the piece at Ranma at<br/>full force.<p>Ranma-kun caught it. And broke it between his thumb and<br/>finger. "She's not pleasing me."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda enter the dojo, leaving Ranma-kun outside. He<br/>looked around, Maybe I can take my mind off of it. What<br/>new traps can I add in here? He had gotten the idea back<br/>when he had a thing for American comics. Turning the dojo<br/>into a "Danger Room" would set the Tendou apart from<br/>others. I wish I knew something about electronics or<br/>could afford something fancy. But all of my traps are<br/>just things a good carpenter can make. It helped that<br/>there were a few times that the dojo had to be entirely<br/>rebuilt. Don't think about that, either: You're<br/>discouraged enough!<p>He stopped trying, his anger replaced by despair. "I<br/>can't kid myself any more. Ranma's going to inherit the<br/>dojo." He shuffled about blindly. "Kasumi deserves that.<br/>This is HER house. This is her neighborhood, with friends<br/>and acquaintances she grew up with. She wouldn't be happy<br/>living any place else."<p>He realized at last he was near the shomen/the main wall<br/>of the dojo. He drew himself up in the proper position,<br/>and bowed to the kami of the dojo. It wasn't a god; it<br/>wasn't even strictly speaking a being. It was the spirit<br/>of the dojo, one rank above ANY martial arts master who<br/>would enter the training hall. He showed the respect the<br/>idea of a dojo deserved. "May Ranma bring you the proper<br/>honor."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda reluctantly woke up when he heard somebody<br/>knocking at his bedroom door. Kasumi said, "Kaneda. It's<br/>time to get ready for the temple. Breakfast is waiting."<p>Kaneda grumbled something to let Oneesan know he was up:<br/>"On a Sunday! That's my day off."<p>Kasumi asked, "Are you getting out of bed?"<p>He threw the covers off; he then just lay there.<p>Kasumi asked, "Kaneda?"<p>Kaneda asked, "Kasumi, why did you agree? You don't<br/>honestly think going to this temple will solve anything,<br/>do you?" He was ashamed to think that Kasumi might<br/>actually want to marry Ranma...because of love. Being a<br/>married woman, she would never have to recognize Dr.<br/>Tofu's love for her.<p>Kasumi asked, "May I come in?"<p>He threw his blanket back over himself and said she<br/>could. Kasumi entered, giving a little bow at the<br/>threshold, and closed the door behind her. There she<br/>stayed, "Kaneda, I found my zen years ago." she briefly<br/>left her oneness with the moment for a sad one in the<br/>past, "...shortly after Mother died. Dr. Tofu helped me<br/>find it." She returned to her usual state, "I enjoy the<br/>serenity. Part of that peace is to believing goodwill<br/>will get back goodwill. If not in this lifetime, in<br/>another."<p>Kaneda frowned, " ' Very fatalistic." He had heard<br/>variations on the confession before. Kasumi's idea of Zen<br/>wasn't orthodox, but it WAS how she lived her life. He<br/>still couldn't understand the sense in it. Calm, peace,<br/>serenity was just not in his nature.<p>Kasumi smiled, "I also believe in magic." It said she had<br/>a secret.<p>Kaneda-the-Cursed couldn't argue against magic. He sat up<br/>in his bed, "What's the name of the temple?"<p>Kasumi said, "You'll see," and let herself out.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki, on the other hand, preferred the theory of<br/>probability. That she understood from Western media COULD<br/>be cheated: Logically. The tales of magic always seemed<br/>to have hidden conditions that the user didn't find out<br/>about until it was too late. If there were going to be<br/>conditions, SHE wanted to be the one setting them.<p>But Nabiki agreed to walk with everybody until they got<br/>to the local business district. "I am NOT going to miss<br/>out on my first chance for a date Kuno-baby since *I*<br/>broke up with the idiot." She, too, had a secret behind<br/>her smile. The unraveling of her fantasies (both<br/>financial and sexual) was still fresh. Whatever else she<br/>had planned, a little petty payback was also on her<br/>agenda.<p>The date was for noon, so she dressed casually. She wore<br/>a white-red-striped pullover, and pleated green slacks.<p>Kasumi asked, "What will you do until your date, Nabiki?<br/>It is over an hour away."<p>Nabiki smiled and waved as she left them, "Window shop!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi wore a colorful kimono decorated with a pattern of<br/>cranes. While her attire was traditional, the pumps on<br/>her feet weren't.<p>Still frowning somewhat, Kaneda said to her, "You're<br/>really doing it right. You usually don't wear anything<br/>but skirt and blouse." Kaneda had merely put on a clean<br/>Furinkan boys' uniform Kasumi had laid out for him.<p>Kasumi said in a relaxed fashion, "This IS to petition<br/>the traditional gods on something that will effect the<br/>rest of our lives."<p>Kaneda looked down at her shoes, but made no further<br/>comment on the matter.<p>Soun Tendou nodded. "How true. It's best to present<br/>oneself in a way that reminds the gods of a time when we<br/>mortals were in terrified awe of them." He wore a white<br/>kimono that was typical for males, but he had insisted on<br/>wearing a haori/half-coat over it that matched the brown<br/>do-gi he usually wore. Kaneda noted that his dad DID have<br/>on traditional getas/clog sandals.<p>Ranma-kun groused, "I don't see why you have to make a<br/>big deal of it. Me and Pop always go to religious places<br/>with whatever we have on." They were in the same, though<br/>laundered, clothes they were wearing the first day they<br/>arrived at the Tendous. They were wearing the only<br/>clothes the Tendous had seen them in for the past five<br/>days.<p>Genma told him, "Quiet, Boy! That was only because we<br/>were travelers who had limit what we carry on our backs."<p>Ranma glared at him, "Oh, yeah! Kasumi offered to lend<br/>you something else, but you wouldn't do it!"<p>Genma looked for his face, and found it with, "Ha-rmph!<br/>That's because the gods wouldn't recognize me in anything<br/>else. THIS is all they know me to wear."<p>Ranma shifted his glare to the Chinese outfit he was<br/>wearing, "Then *I* shouldn't go at all! They're not gonna<br/>recognize me in this thing." Then he muttered, "I wish I<br/>didn't have to wear stuff like this." A guy who changed<br/>into a girl DIDN'T want to stand out by wearing clothes<br/>nobody else wore around him...her.<p>Kaneda's ears pricked up at that. But then he dropped the<br/>question. What does it matter to me, any more: Ranma can<br/>be in low-cut dress slit up to BOTH hips and I'd have no<br/>right to ask her why! He groaned to himself. All I<br/>could do is let myself be tortured.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Soun Tendou asked, "How much further is it, Kasumi? We're<br/>nearly in the next town."<p>Kasumi smiled patiently, "We're almost there. Actually,<br/>we're not much further than it is from our home to<br/>Furinkan High School."<p>Having been automatically taking notes on the terrain,<br/>Ranma said, "Except instead of going east, we're going<br/>south."<p>Kaneda asked, "How did you find this temple, Kasumi? In<br/>the telephone book?"<p>Kasumi said, "Well, actually-"<p>Kaneda had to interrupt her when he saw the high, genuine<br/>fortress walls of a huge compound ahead of them: "Oh-wow!<br/>Why didn't I know a temple like THIS was in Nerima!"<p>Saotome said, "It IS impressive."<p>Ranma said, "Ha! ' Just a bunch of plastered stone."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, no. This isn't the temple. That's<br/>around in back."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>They had to go all the way around the compound that<br/>covered hectares/acres. It took up at least the same area<br/>as all of Furinkan High did!<p>At last they came to a high, wooded hill. The long<br/>stairway up had a torii gate at the zag in the middle.<br/>There was no sign to be seen telling the name of the<br/>temple.<p>It was only when they reached the top did they see the<br/>temple walls. The compound appeared to be about the size<br/>of the Tendou compound, though far older looking.<p>The thick wall's high, thick wooden door was closed.<p>Ranma asked, "Now what! Do we knock? Do we kick the<br/>gate down? I could just jump over the wall and let us<br/>in."<p>Kasumi fretted, "Oh, my! I hadn't counted on this! This<br/>temple must be private." She opened her cloth sachet<br/>purse, and looked inside it, as if she would find the key<br/>there.<p>Soun suggested, "Why don't we just see if knocking will<br/>bring an answer?"<p>No sooner had Genma raised his fist than a voice yelled<br/>from inside: "Go away! You're not welcome! This is NOT a<br/>public temple!"<p>Kasumi found what she was looking for in her drawstring<br/>purse, "Mister! I believe I have a pass!"<p>The old man answered, "I am not a "Mister": I am a<br/>priest!"<p>Kasumi held up her "pass", "If you will just look at it."<p>Kaneda recognized it, "That's my talisman!" It was the<br/>small rectangle with two holes for a loop of red string.<br/>On its pink silk was a gold emblem, and writing in black<br/>kanji that read [By grace of Benten, let Amaterisu have<br/>the ears of the Kamis of Water.]<p>Their father became gravely concerned, "The omamori<br/>that's supposed to remain UNDER your mattress and never<br/>taken out!"<p>The priest behind the gate yelled, "And why should a<br/>simple charm give you leave to enter a place best erased<br/>from the memory of man!"<p>Kasumi held up the side opposite the one with the kanji<br/>spell, "Because this temple made this special omamori. It<br/>says so on the back." As the old priest thought it over,<br/>she added, "It even has a map. From our house to here."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Behind the gate was a typical, if dilapidated, main<br/>temple hall. It was set in a sea of stone weathered<br/>flagstones, with grass growing between their cracks. Only<br/>here and there were there spaces for grass, flowers and<br/>trees to deliberately find sunlight. But they, too, were<br/>untended and overgrown.<p>Ranma sniffed disapprovingly, "All the temples *I* seen<br/>are better kept up than this one."<p>His father agreed, "...Even the poorest."<p>By the time the old priest with the long gray hair had<br/>opened the heavy gate with the creaky hinges wide enough<br/>to allow them to enter, an equally old woman was<br/>approaching them. She, like the man, was dressed in the<br/>typical white gi shirt, red hakama/pleated trousers, and<br/>zori sandals of a Shinto priest. Her long, loose white<br/>hair nearly touched the ground she was stooped over so<br/>much. And though she walked awkwardly, she didn't use a<br/>cane or staff. She greeted them, "What can my husband and<br/>I do for you...guests?"<p>Then her bright eyes spotted the omamori Kasumi held. Her<br/>attitude changed, "Ah! Come this way: Around to the<br/>back."<p>They followed her; and the old priest followed them.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The flagstone theme continued all around the temple. In<br/>back, at the edge of the courtyard, there was a small<br/>building about the size of a bedroom. Beyond that, tucked<br/>away in back almost hidden among the corpse of trees, was<br/>the caretakers' residence.<p>The old priestess at last turned to them, and said, "Our<br/>name is Ryoushin. We welcome you as our guests to the<br/>Temple of the Nine Abilities."<p>Saotome was interested, "..."Nine Abilities"?"<p>Mrs. Ryoushin said, "You have heard of the goddess<br/>Benten, I assume?"<p>Kasumi said, "Benten is one of the seven lucky gods.<p>Soun Tendou elaborated, "She is the goddess of reason<br/>ability, wisdom, knowledge, music, the arts,<br/>eloquence..."<p>(The old priest said, "And love! Do not forget she is a<br/>goddess of love!")<p>Ignoring her husband, the old priestess said, "Would not<br/>you say that Benten, being the goddess of all of that,<br/>makes her the goddess of at LEAST nine abilities?"<p>Saotome nodded enthusiastically, "That it does!"<p>Kaneda conceded, "Well, "nine abilities" IS the literal<br/>meaning of ideograph for "capable"."<p>The old priest raised his voice as he insisted, "And<br/>LOVE! Do not forget Benten is also the goddess of love!"<p>The old priestess said, "Quiet, you old fool! Is that ALL<br/>you think about!"<p>The visitors TRIED not to think about it.<p>The old priestess said, "Excuse my husband. He gets other<br/>gods of love confused with Benten."<p>Soun said in as dignified manner as he could, "That's<br/>quite understandable. Their, uh, 'myths' often have<br/>surface similarities."<p>The old priestess said, "Benten is FIRST a goddess of<br/>enlightened love."<p>The old priest said, "And THEN physical love!" He<br/>addressed them newcomers, "...Inspired love makes for the<br/>best kind, you know." And he insisted, "It's been PROVEN<br/>by science!"<p>Again everybody had a giant sweatdrop, with Kasumi<br/>blushing the most.<p>Everybody but Ranma-kun who didn't seem able to make the<br/>connection, "So that's why we're here. But I don't see<br/>what love's gotta do with an arranged marriage."<p>The old priest cried, "Didn't you HEAR what I said about<br/>love!" He took out a meter-long bamboo blowgun, and hit<br/>Ranma in the back of the head with a pebble.<p>Ranma put his hand over the area, "Hey!" He glared over<br/>his shoulder at the old man.<p>Mrs. Ryoushin said, "Arranged marriages fail, or SHOULD<br/>fail. Love can make any hardship easier to bear. And the<br/>goddess can inspire love." Her alert gaze narrowed on<br/>Kasumi, but she addressed the others, "If that is why you<br/>are here, we the priests of Benten can help you find the<br/>path towards enlightened love."<p>The old priestess asked Kasumi, "Is this omamori yours?"<p>Having still not lost her blush, Kasumi said, "Oh, my,<br/>no! This is my brother's."<p>Seeing the family resemblance, the old priestess asked<br/>Kaneda, "You object to the marriage?"<p>Kaneda said, "You bet!" But he looked at his dad, and<br/>backed down from giving a full display of his anger. The<br/>matter was settled as far as his parent was concerned.<p>The old woman gave the once over to Mr. Saotome. "I can<br/>understand why you would not want to marry this ugly,<br/>middle-aged man."<p>Though feeling offended, Genma Saotome was more concerned<br/>about pushing Ranma-kun forward, "Madam! It is my SON<br/>that is to marry Tendou's daughter, there!"<p>Ranma-kun yelled, "Hey! I haven't agreed to anything!"<p>The old priestess asked Ranma, "Do you wish to marry<br/>another of Mr. Tendou's...children?"<p>Ranma-kun told her, "I don't want to marry anybody; I<br/>just want to go back to China!"<p>Ranma's pop told him, "And complete what happened there!<br/>You will first produce an heir."<p>His arms crossed and looking away, Kaneda commented, "You<br/>could still produce an heir."<p>Ranma-kun threatened, "How would you like to produce an<br/>heir!"<p>Kaneda's face said he didn't.<p>The old priestess asked, "Juusenkyo?"<p>Ranma-kun paled, "You, you know about Juusenkyo!"<p>The old priestess said, "Oh, this IS a problem." She said<br/>to her husband, "Mr. Priest, while I consult with this<br/>young woman, you prepare for the Contest of the Corset."<p>The old man cackled, "Corset! Corset! The Contest of the<br/>Corset!"<p>Ranma-kun cried, "I ain't puttin' on no corset!"<p>Kaneda cried with equal force, "Me neither!"<p>The old priest told them, "You don't WEAR the corset!"<br/>And used his blowgun on Ranma-kun again.<p>Ranma-kun cried, "Hey! Why'd you only hit me!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>While everybody but Kasumi's father was distracted by<br/>Ranma yelling at the old priest, and the old man pelting<br/>the boy with pebbles, the old priestess led Kasumi away.<br/>She led her into the room-sized house.<p>The sliding wooden door was kept open only by Kasumi's<br/>body; she was a little fearful of the darkness beyond. But<br/>she put her trust in her understanding of Zen. As the old<br/>priestess lit an ancient oil lamp, she said, "In here is the<br/>reason why the temple was built. Because of its terrible<br/>power, it is kept secret and apart from the main hall."<p>As the light from the lamp revealed its shadowy form,<br/>Kasumi said, "Oh, my!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Genma Saotome cried, "OW!" as he slapped the back of his<br/>neck. He turned away from the door that had closed behind<br/>the two women. He scowled at the old man with the<br/>blowgun.<p>The old priest cried, "You are not allowed in! A curse<br/>upon any who go in without the blessing of the goddess!"<p>Genma said, "I was just..." He fell to his knees, and<br/>then to the ground. He was quickly snoring.<p>Ranma-kun cried, "Why you-Use a drugged dart on MY Old<br/>Man!" He lunged-And got beaned with a pebble in the<br/>forehead hard enough to stop.<p>Kaneda commented, "He certainly has a lot of breath for<br/>an old man."<p>The old priest said, "It's the power of LOVE!" Then he<br/>cackled, "...And a LOT of exercise."<p>Kaneda said, "I think I'm going to be sick."<p>His dad felt just a LITTLE queasy, "It's all a matter of<br/>perspective, I guess."<p>The old priest directed Ranma with his bamboo blowgun,<br/>"You: One square over, there." Then to Kaneda, "And you,<br/>over on that flagstone!"<p>Kaneda said, "And if I refuse?"<p>Kaneda got a pebble bounced off HIS head.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Inside the building, Kasumi said, "It's a well." The pit<br/>was hidden behind a waist-high, moldy, solid wooden<br/>fence.<p>Carrying the lamp ahead of her, the old priestess walked<br/>toward it, "Are you aware of the story of the goddess<br/>Benten and the orochi?"<p>Being polite, Kasumi followed the old woman. "Oh, my! I<br/>probably do, but I can't remember which is her story. It<br/>seems so many stories about water gods involve dragons,<br/>...or serpents."<p>The old woman nodded, "That is true. For THEY are at the<br/>heart of waters of magic, like Juusenkyo, and<br/>Ryugenzawa."<p>Kasumi asked in wonder, "...and this well?"<p>The old woman looked down into the pit, "Here sleeps one<br/>of children of Benten and that fresh water dragon."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, he must still be a small child. It<br/>doesn't look wide enough to let an adult dragon rest<br/>comfortably."<p>The old woman smiled. She turned the lamp towards Kasumi,<br/>"Do you wish to know you why I have told you all of<br/>this?"<p>Kasumi said, "Only if you wish to tell me, Mrs.<br/>Priestess."<p>The old priestess nodded, satisfied with the answer, "I<br/>believe you are somebody who CAN be blessed by the<br/>goddess!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>In position on his flagstone, another pebble struck<br/>Ranma-kun's head, "Ow! I just wanted to know WHAT the<br/>idea of this stupid game is!"<p>The old man had brought a teapot and two cups from the<br/>temple's porch. He was now kneeling between Ranma-kun and<br/>Kaneda. Putting down the blowgun, he started pouring hot<br/>water from his ancient teapot into two teacups, "You<br/>know about the Japanese tea ceremony?"<p>Ranma-kun still resentful, said, "Yeah!"<p>The old man said, "This isn't anything like that!" and<br/>splashed the water from the cups on both Ranma and<br/>Kaneda.<p>Kane-chan cried, "What did you do that for!" She was<br/>wearing a mid-length white dress with a few bows and<br/>ruffles.<p>The same water that was hot enough to make Kaneda change<br/>was cool enough to change Ranma.<p>Ranma-chan threatened, "I'll break THAT bamboo peashooter<br/>of yours, too!" He had broken it on his way to the<br/>square.<p>Getting up with his tea set, the old priest said, "I have<br/>plenty more where they came from."<p>Soun Tendou stood on the sidelines. His eyes were now<br/>wide open. Or not: "A, Akane?... How did she get here?"<p>The old priest handed the man the tea things to hold;<br/>"She is here to partake in an engagement ceremony."<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "I don't want to get engaged!"<p>The old priest said, "Then you had better win the<br/>contest. The winner will prove to the goddess of reason<br/>and inspiration WHO she should favor. With those<br/>abilities, the winner can tie the loser to him as closely<br/>as the sides of a corset."<p>Soun Tendou told the old priest, "But Akane is going to<br/>be part of the TENDOU family!"<p>The old priest said, "She still may be: If she loses." He<br/>held up his blowgun, ready to bring it down as a signal,<br/>"May the goddess of the seven lucky gods show the better<br/>man the winning card!" And the contest began!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi didn't blink, "Me? Blessed by the gods?"<p>The old priestess returned their gaze on the still water<br/>of the magic well, "Each of the dragons have a different<br/>magic. The waters of Juusenkyo have transformation magic.<br/>The waters of Ryugenzawa have curative magic." She lifted<br/>her lamp, "Here we have the magic of ability!"<p>Kasumi thought she understood, "As in the "nine<br/>abilities"."<p>The priestess smiled, pleased, "You do understand."<p>Kasumi asked, "Are you going to push me in the well?"<p>The old woman asked, "Do you wish to be pushed in the<br/>well?"<p>Kasumi said, "No. But Ranma's father pushed him in a<br/>spring at Juusenkyo."<p>The old priestess nodded, "Ah, yes! It is always better<br/>that the magic be placed on a person accidentally." She<br/>shook her head sadly, "Far better. If a person<br/>intentionally tries to claim the magic of a dragon, then<br/>he becomes TWICE cursed!"<p>Kasumi asked, "Oh, my, twice cursed?"<p>Looking as if she had bourn a great burden all of her<br/>life, she said, "...They become a curse to others, as<br/>well."<p>But she brought her lamp up to illuminate Kasumi's face,<br/>"But if it is done by somebody pure of heart, then the<br/>curse becomes a blessing."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan stood on his flagstone, waiting for Ranma-chan<br/>to make her move. Ranma-chan waited for Kane-chan to make<br/>HERS.<p>The old priest cackled, "Step on the wrong square, and<br/>you lose!"<p>Kane-chan's eyes darted over the worn flagstones, trying<br/>to see something...the tiniest mark...anything that made<br/>even ONE different. All she saw was erosion. She began to<br/>sweat.<p>Ranma-chan had her own ideas how to win, "Ha! I don't<br/>HAVE to step on any! I know the Saotome Mid-air<br/>techniques: I can jump onto the porch of the temple!"<p>The old priest laughed, "Go ahead! But you'd LOSE. The<br/>idea is to step on the CORRECT squares!"<p>Kane-chan almost tore at her long black hair, What ARE<br/>the correct squares! I can't figure this out! Being<br/>distracted by this STUPID dress and bra doesn't help!<p>Not allowed to "cut the Gordian Knot", Ranma-chan was<br/>having even more of a problem coming up with an idea:<br/>"Aaar! I'm starting to get a head-ache!"<p>But, then suddenly, Ranma-chan cried, "You know about<br/>Juusenkyo: You know about magic!" She looked around the<br/>flagstones, surveying them. "AND you have traps hidden<br/>under the stones." She brought up her hands into martial<br/>arts position, "All of that means danger! I just have to<br/>use my trained senses."<p>Kane-chan felt her very last slim chance at victory<br/>pulling away from her. My martial arts senses are no<br/>match for RANMA'S!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi sighed, "Oh, my! I am sorry Mrs. Priestess, but I<br/>am not ready to receive a blessing."<p>The priestess said, "What! You do not WISH to be<br/>blessed by the goddess?"<p>Kasumi said, "If I did, I would not have a," she blushed<br/>at even having to consider it, "...a pure heart."<p>The old woman sighed herself, and nodded regretfully,<br/>"That is the problem with a pure heart." But she stepped<br/>forward, and demanded, "But when you ARE ready to receive<br/>a blessing! You will come HERE! It has been so<br/>terribly long since anybody has been blessed by this<br/>accursed place!"<p>Kasumi felt sorry for the poor old woman. "Of course,<br/>Mrs. Ryoushin. When there is an honest need for me to be<br/>blessed, I shall make it a point to come back here."<p>With her free hand the old woman grasped one of Kasumi's.<br/>"Thank you! Thank you, so much, my child!"<p>Kasumi said, "But right now, I must think of my family<br/>and guests"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Now Ranma-chan was sweating heavily. She was using all of<br/>the techniques she had learned over her relentless years<br/>of training to sense something, ANYTHING beneath the<br/>flagstones.<p>Kane-chan had to ask herself, What! Ranma can't<br/>detect the dangers! If she can't, then I-<p>First came the inspiration: There ARE no dangers!<p>Kane-chan looked at the simple stones in a new way:<br/>Benten is the goddess of reason! You have to THINK to<br/>win this contest! She said, "But think WHAT!<p>"Clues! You use the clues to think with!"<p>Then came the reasoning: "Contest of the Corset"...<br/>"goddess of the seven lucky gods"... "show the better man<br/>the winning card"... Her brain began to hurt. What is<br/>the idea of CARDS doing in a Shinto ritual! They were<br/>introduced by the Portuguese! What kind of temple would<br/>have a contest built around-<p>Kane-chan saw the light! "Corsets aren't Japanese,<br/>EITHER!" She found the pattern in the flagstones! It was<br/>a magic square, 25 by 25 flagstones-With Ranma in the<br/>middle! She looked around herself: Yes! From where<br/>Ranma's standing, I'M in the middle of a magic square,<br/>too!<p>Kane-chan cried, "That's it!" and, lifting her skirt,<br/>leaped! It was a jump Ranma could've easily made. But<br/>Kane-chan did it on wings of the goddess: Divine<br/>inspiration and love. She jumped diagonally to the<br/>flagstone on Ranma's right-front. There was another flagstone<br/>between them, and Kane-chan was JUST out of Ranma-chan's<br/>short reach.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Ah, ha! That square is safe!"<p>Kane-chan almost laughed for joy, "For me! YOU have to<br/>find your OWN squares!" And she leaped diagonally again,<br/>to the square at Ranma-chan's right side. All Ranma-<br/>chan could do was stay on her flagstone and turn to<br/>follow Kane-chan, hoping to learn what the secret was<br/>before it was too late for her.<p>Kane-chan knew the secret: The winning card is the Seven<br/>of Hearts! Ranma is the central heart, and three hearts on<br/>each side! Think of the six hearts as the holes of a<br/>CORSET-"And all I have to do is lace the sides of the<br/>corset together!"<p>Feeling utterly frustrated, Ranma-chan challenged that<br/>stupid logic, "Yeah! And what are you tying the corset<br/>WITH!"<p>Kane-chan did laugh as she jumped towards the last square<br/>before pulling the corset closed, trapping Ranma inside,<br/>"The RED STRING!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The lamp had been set the rail of one of the well's<br/>fences. With a small pair of scissors, the old priestess<br/>cut the red string loop of Kaneda's omamori.<p>Kasumi looked on, concerned, "You say that this is<br/>actually a piece of Kaneda's red string?" Folklore said<br/>that it connected people destined to fall in love since<br/>before they were born.<p>The old woman nodded, "Yes. The loop directed your, uh,<br/>'brother' to herself, and her to him. Until the matter of<br/>sex was decided, all that the red string could do was<br/>find a true match in life, be they friend or foe."<p>She handed the string to Kasumi, "But this relationship<br/>will not be decided by sex."<p>Kasumi accepted it; "You mean the one with Ranma?"<p>The old woman shrugged, "Perhaps. Cut off little pieces<br/>and sew them into their clothes. You don't have to worry<br/>about running out of enough string. This is its just the<br/>physical manifestation. There will always be more. And<br/>the real connection will remain unbroken."<p>Kasumi nodded, accepting the magic object. But she asked<br/>in a concerned voice, "But what if Ranma isn't the one,<br/>uh, Kane-chan should marry?"<p>The old priestess said, "Then the red string between the<br/>two will get tangled with the real love on the other end<br/>of the their red strings, and draw them those loves in."<p>Kasumi nodded, thinking she understood. "And this<br/>contest? The, uh..."<p>The old woman smiled, " "The Contest of the Corset"?<br/>There is no magic to it. It is just to give themselves a<br/>reason to believe." She warned Kasumi, "You must not let<br/>them find out that the real magic is in this red string."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, of course not. That could spoil<br/>everything, couldn't it?"<p>With a look of admiration, the old priestess said,<br/>"Perhaps you are already blessed. You certainly seem<br/>capable."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Meanwhile, it was almost time for Nabiki's 'date'.<p>Little did Tatewaki Kuno know that the girls he truly<br/>wished to be with were at one of his family's private<br/>temples. Would he ever find a girl CAPABLE enough to<br/>remove his curse?<p>The End of this chapter<br/>[Notice: fiddle with a chapter up to a week after I post<br/>it. Anytime major changes are made, I<br/>will let the reader know in another chapter.]
