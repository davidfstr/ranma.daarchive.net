</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>04: Hot Water<p>A shirtless 'Akane Saotome' was standing in the rough<br/>besides the empty sports fields behind Furinkan High. Her<br/>hands were raised only in the position, to defend-or-<br/>attack, not to hide her nude boobs. She tried to keep her<br/>thoughts off of her bare boobs, which the stiff breeze<br/>was making chilly. Her nipples were hard. But worst yet<br/>was a guy was staring at them.<p>And not just any guy: "You would challenge Tatewaki<br/>Kuno?" he said in amazement. The "Shooting Star of the<br/>High School Kendo World", or whatever he was calling<br/>himself this week, was in his gi and had his<br/>bokken/wooden sword out. He was holding the hiltless<br/>sword like a samurai, by both hands.<p>But the sight of half-naked girl had caused the bokken's<br/>tip to dip almost to the ground.<p>Kane-chan answered, "Yes! I just said that. Are you going<br/>to do something about it before I change my mind!"<p>"Akane Saotome," Kuno repeated the name of his opponent.<br/>"Lest too light winning makes the prize light, I accept."<br/>He raised his sword towards her. "If you should defeat<br/>me, I shall allow you to date me. But beware. Should you<br/>prove worthy of me, I am prepared to lose."<p>Kune-chan said, "Don't lose too easy, or YOU won't be<br/>worthy of me!"<p>Kuno's eyes leaped fully off of her chest. It took him a<br/>moment to deal with the affront. Then he smiled, "A woman<br/>thinking ahead!" He paused to take a dashing pose, "But<br/>can a Kuno NOT be the proper sire?"<p>It was Kane-chan's turn to let her weapons fall in<br/>amazement. "What!" -{Maybe this wasn't such a good<br/>idea after all!}-<p>That's when Kuno charged, "HYAHH!" He used a low-and-up<br/>slash. But Kane-chan leaped and somersaulted off of his<br/>tall shoulders. She landed behind him.<p>She didn't have time to tell herself how stupid she was<br/>to do that without something that tied down her boobs:<br/>Kuno came back to slashed at shoulder-height.<p>This time Kane-chan leaped high over and far from Kuno.<br/>This time her abused boobs screamed too loudly to be<br/>ignored, -{If only I'd practiced as a girl!}-<p>Kuno turned in one fluid motion and charged, his bokken<br/>raised over his head. He sends it down towards-<p>Kune-chan stopped it in her bare hands. The hurt was so<br/>bad over her chest she couldn't make any comment.<p>Kuno's eyes fixed on the taut boobs. He used all his<br/>manly strength to press his bokken down. The female was<br/>being forced to lower herself. "You're mine!"<p>Kane-chan fell. The bokken was still between her palms.<br/>She did a martial arts landing. She brought the foot that<br/>had slipped on the damp grass up against Kuno's belly.<p>And tossed him with all her might. Only when he was<br/>flying, did she allow herself to say, "Ow!" -{Momentum<br/>means something different to a girl!}-<p>Ranma-chan could have let Kuno fall on his head, but what<br/>would that prove? It had much more meaning to catch him<br/>in her outstretched hands.<p>Kuno said, "We meet again." He was looking at the<br/>cleavage exposed by her unfastened shirt.<p>The red-haired girl told him, "What kinda man ARE you,<br/>fightin' girls! You're not a man!" And she let his head<br/>continue to the ground.<p>Whang! He then toppled over onto his butt. "That hurt,<br/>you know."<p>Kane-chan came hurrying over as fast as her sore boobs<br/>would allow, "Ranma! You're a girl again!" -{Damn! There<br/>goes THAT plan! I'll have to wait for another time!}-<p>Ranma-chan told her, "This is who he was fightin'! And I<br/>DON'T like people fightin' my fights for me!" She threw<br/>Kane-chan's shirt at her.<p>Kane-chan caught it, "I WASN'T fightin' YOUR fight! I<br/>was-"<p>Ranma-chan ignored her to address Kuno, "I challenged you<br/>first! You should be fightin' me!"<p>Kuno said, "But you just said-"<p>Ranma-chan took the position, "I'm different!"<p>Kuno rose, "That you are, My Maiden of Battle!" (Kane-<br/>chan cried, "Hey! What about me!) "Beauty doth<br/>persuade: If you can defeat me-" And he reached for the<br/>sword Kane-chan still held in her hands, "I shall allow<br/>you to DATE with me!"<p>The bare foot girl landed on his out-thrust wooden sword,<br/>slid forward as if it were a tightrope, and, "Who asked<br/>for a DATE, anyway!" kicked him solidly in the cheek.<p>She did two mid-air martial arts leg thrusts for<br/>emphasis, and landed upright.<p>Kuno was lying on the ground in a daze. Ranma-chan strode<br/>over to his disgraced bokken. She flipped it up using<br/>just the tops of her toes. Then caught it. Putting it<br/>over her shoulder, she said, "Guess what, Kuno. I ain't<br/>goin' on any date with you."<p>Ranma-chan said, "I'm goin' home."<p>Kane-chan looked at Kuno, then at Ranma's back. She<br/>followed her, buttoning her shirt, "It's not even lunch<br/>yet. What about your father!"<p>Ranma-chan simply pointed high up into the leaves of a<br/>tree. The panda's claws were embedded into the trunk. It<br/>wasn't sure how well pandas could get down, and wasn't<br/>ready yet to find out.<p>Kuno looked at the departing redhead, "She is formidable.<br/>And the other..." And then he lost his struggle against<br/>consciousness.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>As they headed for the exit from the school grounds,<br/>Ranma-chan frowned, "What was the idea challengin' him<br/>like that!"<p>Kane-chan told her, "I was fightin' Kuno long before<br/>you." -(Don't tell her the real reason.}-<p>Ranma-chan snorted, "Kaneda Tendou was fightin' him. Not<br/>some worse-than-tomboy chick named 'Akane SAOTOME'."<p>Kane-chan said, "It's my fault you got into a fight with<br/>the jerk. If you weren't a girl, he at least wouldn't<br/>think about dating you."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Oh, so now that he's thinin' of datin'<br/>me, you decide YOU want to date him."<p>Kane-chan cried, "No! ...Well..." The thought of going out<br/>on a triple date HAD crossed her mind. But JUST to so she<br/>could step in case she had to help Ranma. Er, in anything<br/>not having to do with martial arts. She had a very hard<br/>time remembering Ranma wasn't a girl. Herself, on the<br/>other hand, "Why would I want to date Kuno! He's a<br/>guy!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "He's also tall, dark, handsome, rich,<br/>and any number of other things. Remember the list you<br/>made?" Ranma made another bid at getting her interested<br/>in somebody besides her.<p>Kane-chan raised her voice, "I did NOT make a list!<br/>Nabiki did."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Oh... So the only reason you didn't try<br/>for him before was because of your sister!"<p>Kane-chan glared at her. She was deliberately insulting<br/>her manhood. "ALSO on that list was one great big<br/>deficit: Kuno's insane!"<p>Ranma shrugged her shoulders, "So he's a little inbred.<br/>That makes it a good thing for his clan to get some fresh<br/>blood. ' May even explain WHY he lookin' to get a girl<br/>who can 'knock down' the social barriers for him."<p>Kane-chan said, "Now look who sounds like she's<br/>interested." She turned her nose up, "Is that how you<br/>think...bloodlines, and class, or...whatever your idea of<br/>eugenics is?"<p>Ranma-chan said, " "Eugenics"? No! I know a lot of<br/>girls want to marry up, but I ain't-" She had a thought,<br/>"A girl WOULD be marryin' up!"<p>Kane-chan said, "At the cost of having to LIVE with the<br/>guy!"<p>Ranma-chan put her hands behind her head, "Not<br/>necessarily. Kuno strikes me as a pretty traditional<br/>samurai-type. That means his wife wouldn't hafta see him<br/>much."<p>Kane-chan shuddered, "Except to...'procreate'."<p>Ranma-chan walked on, apparently not taking the thought<br/>of having sex with a guy seriously.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It wasn't until they were nearing Dr. Tofu's clinic that<br/>Kane-chan finally thought to mention, "You haven't<br/>fastened your shirt, yet." They had been lucky. The only<br/>people they'd come across were women and small children.<br/>The women had kept their comments to themselves, and<br/>Ranma was used to children staring at her.<p>Ranma-chan looked down. She sighed, and started<br/>fastening. "What a bother. As a guy I don't have to think<br/>much about how I look." She had a thought, "Why DID you<br/>take your shirt off?"<p>Kane-chan looked at her close her shirt over the shifting<br/>mounds. Her face reddened, "Because I EXPECTED you to<br/>forget about your shirt, and, and..." she mumbled,<br/>"...because I was competing against C cups." Her own boobs<br/>seemed like giant (sore) nuisances, but they were only<br/>B's.<p>Ranma-chan frowned, "When it comes to competin', SMALLER<br/>are better. None is the best."<p>Kane-chan thought, -{She certainly doesn't THINK like a<br/>girl.}- Then, -{Wait! Does that mean *I* do!}-<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Dr. Tofu's patients at this time were elderly, and mostly<br/>women. It wouldn't do just to walk into the infirmary,<br/>now. Unless it was somebody like Mrs. Tanaka, the patient<br/>in there with the doctor wouldn't want people to know<br/>what their problem was.<p>Of course Ranma-chan couldn't just sit, so Kane-chan<br/>stood, too. The whispered talk of the others became<br/>centered on: "The girls these days!"/ "In MY day, a girl<br/>knew how to dress like a girl."/ "Right, we'd never wear<br/>pants."/ "If the gods had wanted girls to look like boys,<br/>they'd wouldn't have given us hips."<p>The mention of hips took Kane-chan's mind away from her<br/>boobs.<p>Ranma-chan said, "It'd be quicker and simpler just to go<br/>back home."<p>Kane-chan said, "But we're supposed to be in school."<br/>Then he remembered, "The lav! It has a sink."<p>Ranma-chan made sure Kane-chan was looking as she looked<br/>around. "And what about them?"<p>Kane-chan smiled for the waiting room. -{My hair trick<br/>would backfire here.}- "We could use another public lav."<p>Ranma-chan frowned at the idea, "Why didn't you think of<br/>that before?"<p>Kane-chan got angry, "Why didn't YOU."<p>Ranma-chan said, "I'm goin'."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>There were no public restrooms between the clinic and the<br/>Tendous'. But there were puddles...and a bicycler who was<br/>delivering barbequed eel and who wasn't paying attention.<p>Splash!<p>Ranma-chan accused, "You did that on purpose!"<p>Kaneda, ticked, replied, "No I didn't!" He would've liked<br/>to have towered over her when he yelled, but she was up<br/>walking a fence again. -{She won't even let a guy feel<br/>like a guy.}-<p>Ranma-chan grumbled, "At least I didn't get wet."<p>Kaneda 'offered', "I could change that." He glanced at<br/>another puddle.<p>Ranma-chan said, "But I wouldn't change!"<p>Kaneda said, "That's why *I* should be the guy, dummy!"<p>Ranma-chan stopped on top of a fence, "What!"<p>Kaneda stopped to confront her, "There's always going to<br/>be accidents with water. Hardly any of it is going to be<br/>hot! It's just simpler if you stay a girl!"<p>Ranma-chan's fists shot down and her toes curled up as<br/>she yelled, "I'm a GUY!"<p>Kaneda yelled back, "Look in the mirror! AND inside: A<br/>girl's brain has GOT to go with that body!"<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "You're the real girl!" He got a look<br/>in her eye, "And I think it's time YOU started using your<br/>girl brain!"<p>Ranma jumped down to his level. For a second Kaneda<br/>thought she saw a fiery red glow about her. A battlle aura!<p>Kaneda backed away, "What, what do you think you're going<br/>to do?"<p>She smiled wickedly, "You're gonna be hit by hot water.<br/>And it AIN'T gonna be by accident!"<p>Kaneda believed that Ranma COULD put him in hot water!<br/>He immediately swung his bookbag. Ranma was knocked<br/>over the wire fence...and into the canal below.<p>Splatsch!<p>Ranma-chan rose from the water sputtering. Then yelled,<br/>"This is a showdown! If you have ANY honor, you'll meet<br/>me in the dojo!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda paced up and down the path to the front door...and<br/>to the gate to the dojo. "What am I going to do! I<br/>can't fight Ranma as a martial artist. She's out of my<br/>class by several levels! The only way I can beat Ranma is<br/>as a girl.<p>"But that's EXACTLY what she wants!" He looked at the<br/>dojo over the wooden fence. "At least if I became a girl<br/>it would neutralize her secret technique."<p>He bowed his head, "But I'd be living in fear of it until<br/>I found out what it is. I would be a coward."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Mad as a wet hornet, Ranma-chan came home to the Tendou<br/>house. She stormed right into it. "Where is he!"<p>Kasumi called out, "Oh, Ranma! You startled me. You're<br/>home early."<p>She was in the garden hall so that's where Ranma-chan<br/>went. "Where's Kaneda! We have a duel to straighten out<br/>our dual roles!"<p>Kasumi called out, "He SHOULD be in school. Shouldn't he?<br/>(Oh, it's times like these I do wish I had a watch.)"<p>When Ranma-chan could, she saw that Kasumi was carrying a<br/>bucket of water. Ignoring that question for the moment,<br/>Ranma rushed to the back hall, "Is he hiding back<br/>here!"<p>Kasumi looked over her shoulder and said, "Kaneda's<br/>hasn't been in the house!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma opened the door to bathroom, "I bet THIS is where<br/>you are! You like bein' a girl in here!" But Kaneda<br/>wasn't in the bathroom.<p>But the bathroom wasn't normal. The plastic stool and<br/>pail were tilted against the side of the tiled furo/tub.<br/>And the bath mat was rolled and upended across the furo.<br/>The sign on it read, [Do not fill!]<p>The taps each had a sign on them, [Do not turn!] and [Do<br/>not touch!]. And the one on the tap you used before you<br/>got in the furo read [Do not twist!].<p>Ranma-chan said, puzzled, "It has to be more than a<br/>problem with the hot water."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan found Kasumi in the kitchen. She was headed<br/>for the back door with the metal bucket. "What's goin'<br/>on?" There were signs over the kitchen sink's taps, too.<p>Kasumi said, "I'm so sorry. We're getting the drains<br/>fixed soon."<p>Ranma-chan went over to her, "Let me take care of that<br/>bail water for you!"<p>Kasumi was about to protest, but didn't want to be<br/>impolite. She smiled and let the girl take it. She bowed,<br/>"Thank you! Too bad you hadn't skipped school earlier.<br/>This is the last one."<p>As Ranma-chan headed out the door, Kasumi informed her,<br/>"Poor it over the gravel beneath the faucet out there!"<p>But the strong, small girl was headed in the opposite<br/>direction. Kasumi said to herself, "I guess she's going<br/>to clean the dojo." She was smiling as she turned around,<br/>"That's the one place I don't have to think about<br/>cleaning."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan had taken four steps in the arena before she<br/>started sinking in a spot of extra wet white sand.<br/>"What! Quicksand!"<p>Before she had time to do anything but react, a fighting<br/>staff came out and forced the bucket over. The water<br/>spilled on top of Ranma-chan: Splash!<p>At the other end of the six-foot-long bo stick was<br/>Kaneda. "So your secret technique DOESfirst need water<br/>to heat."<p>Ranma-chan was still sinking; she was down to her hips<br/>now, "How'd you pull this trick!"<p>Kaneda flicked a lock of his long red hair back with his<br/>thumb, "You're not the only one who knows special<br/>techniques."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Three years earlier Dr. Tofu had had a day off. Kaneda<br/>had invited to spend it at the Tendou's house. Kaneda had<br/>wanted to him to do some coaching and had gotten him to<br/>do a little bo sparing. Despite that it had been raining<br/>earlier, they did it outside the dojo. "It'll be more of<br/>a challenge to do it on wet sand, don't you think, Dr.<br/>Tofu? ANYbody can fight indoors!"<p>The mature accomplished martial artist had gone easy on<br/>the boy, but it was still a workout. Kaneda was good; the<br/>doctor was much better.<p>Then Kasumi had come out with a tray. "Would anybody like<br/>some cold lemonade or tea?"<p>Tofu's glasses steamed up, and he dropped his defenses.<br/>Kaneda knew that the match could not go on. Dejectedly,<br/>he watched as Tofu stirred the sand with one end of his<br/>bo stick while pouring the drinks on the ground, "Kasumi!<br/>Would anybody like something made with your own hands?<br/>What a silly question! I don't see how..."<p>He sank down into the pit he'd bored.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-cha was down to where her hips were covered up.<br/>Ranma-chan used her arms and legs to move through the<br/>sand.<p>Kaneda realized, "If I knew how to swim I might've seen<br/>that coming!"<p>He brought the bo down and started stirring and boring<br/>the sand ahead of Ranma-chan.<p>He wasn't fast enough. Ranma-chan caught the stick with<br/>her hand and pulled. She'd pull Kaneda in if he held on.<p>Kaneda held on. It was a nearly one-sided tug-of-war.<br/>Ranma-chan was stronger and more skilled, despite her<br/>having to swim; and his footing was sand. Again Kaneda<br/>sensed the heat of her battle aura. Ranma smiled at the<br/>taste of victory, "All I have to do is get you a little wet!<br/>Just a little further..." Kaneda HAD been dragged to<br/>within centimeters of his greatest phobia.<p>-{Phobia?}- Then he bent forward at the waist, "Kiss me,<br/>my fiancee!"<p>Ranma-chan yelled, and pushed the staff and the guy back.<p>Kaneda landed on his feet further in the arena, the bo in<br/>hand.<p>Ranma-chan was seriously creeped.<p>Kaneda said, "Get close enough, and I will kiss you!" -<br/>{It WOULD have to sound like a threat.}-<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "Don't you dare! Not as a girl, and<br/>not EVER as a guy!"<p>Kaneda got into the stance, and started to experiment, "I<br/>wonder if I can develop a martial arts kissing<br/>technique?"<p>Determinedly Ranma-chan challenged herself, "All I have<br/>to do is touch you once when you're wet!"<p>Kaneda nodded, "Something else your technique needs."<p>He turned his back on her, and walked away, "I would<br/>rather kiss you as a guy. But if you want me to do it as<br/>a girl..." He turned when he got near the door. He smiled a<br/>challenge at her, "You said you wanted a showdown in the<br/>dojo?"<p>Ranma-chan growled and glowered.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki came home from school. As she was headed for the<br/>front door, she heard noises and loud talk coming from<br/>the dojo:<p>Kaneda said, "...Well, that is one of the things a towel in<br/>a dojo is for!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "When I get my hands on it, I'm going to<br/>wring it around your neck!"<p>Kaneda said, "When you took gym at your other schools,<br/>did you ever do martial arts towel snapping?"<p>There were a series of wet *Snaf!*, *Snaph!* that got<br/>drier. Kaneda explained, "I had to learn it to keep the<br/>guys away from my secret in the locker room."<p>Ranma cried, "Cut that out! You're gonna hit something<br/>sensitive!" The sound of bare feet running on the<br/>floorboards followed and then were gone. She'd leaped.<p>Kaneda yelled, "Towel trampoline defense!"<p>After a few seconds it sounded like Ranma-chan landed<br/>lightly on a foot and a knee on the boards.<p>Kaneda was surprised, "It worked! You're light enough<br/>that I can sling-shot you off of the towel."<p>Ranma roared, "ONLY in my girl-form!" She charged this<br/>time, "I have another source of water!"<p>Kaneda answered, "And I've got the towel!"<p>Nabiki shook her head, "Idiot," and went inside her home.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki changed, and went into the kitchen. Kasumi was<br/>stir-frying dinner. Nabiki leaned against a counter and<br/>watched, "Ranma, Kuno and Kaneda were all anybody could<br/>talk about today, in that order."<p>Kasumi smiled, "It's good that a new girl is getting<br/>known in her new school. I do hope she's getting a good<br/>reputation."<p>Nabiki said, "It depends on how you define "good". At<br/>least everybody knows she can take care of herself."<p>Then she smirked, "Physically, at least."<p>Kasumi sighed, "I guess that will take care of problems<br/>with the boys."<p>Suddenly the kitchen door to the outside burst open, and<br/>in stormed Ranma-chan. "How can I fight somebody I ain't<br/>supposed to fight, and who don't' fight fair ANYWAY!"<br/>She went over to the kitchen sink and turned the hot<br/>water tap.<p>Nothing.<p>She turned on the cold: Nothing!<p>Kasumi said, "I'm sorry, Ranma, but now there's no water<br/>any where in the house. That's why I'm preparing this<br/>type of meal."<p>While Ranma-chan tried not to scream in utter<br/>frustration, Nabiki said, "I thought it was just the<br/>drains!"<p>Kasumi said, "That reminds me, I got the nice plumber to<br/>send us a port-a-potty."<p>Ranma-chan opened the refrigerator door, looked inside,<br/>and then slammed it shut. Ranma grumbled, "Maybe there's<br/>a way I can use the quicksand despite all the grit." She<br/>noticed a bucket.<p>She rushed out of the kitchen with the bucket, "I can use<br/>the water from the koi pond!" Even Nabiki could sense<br/>the battle aura coming from the girl.<p>Nabiki eyed her big sister for a while as she continued<br/>happily preparing dinner. She finally came to the<br/>conclusion, "You turned off the water, didn't you<br/>Kasumi?"<p>Kasumi didn't look at her, "Me? Why would I do that?"<p>Nabiki said, "Oh, I don't know. It wouldn't have anything<br/>to do with Kaneda, would it?"<p>Kasumi said, in a tone that suggested that it reminded<br/>her of a different topic, "I've never seen Kaneda so<br/>happy. Ranma makes an excellent sparing partner."<p>Nabiki didn't buy that as the complete story, "Unh,<br/>hunh." She noted the can with water that Kasumi had used<br/>to clean the vegetables; it was now nearly hidden. "She<br/>even got rid of the used water she would've saved?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda ran in through the garden door and looked around<br/>for a place to hide and rest. He forgot his great plan<br/>when he saw his dad sitting at the family table.<p>He rushed over to him, "Now you're going to tell me the<br/>whole story! Ranma knows how SHE got cursed, I want to<br/>know..." His dad made no move to defend himself. He made<br/>no movement at all.<p>Kasumi came in to set the table. "Father's been like that<br/>all day, Kaneda. I do hope he comes back soon. He needs<br/>to eat good home-cooked meals."<p>Suddenly from the foyer, Kaneda heard Mr. Saotome yell,<br/>"Ranma! Why are you still a girl! I've overlooked it<br/>before. But that was BEFORE you got engaged to a guy!"<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "I ain't engaged to NO guy! Or to the<br/>GIRL she realy is!"<p>Genma said, "End the farce and choose one of the Tendou<br/>girls. Honor the decade old agreement between families<br/>that the son-"<p>Splash!<p>Ranma-chan said, "Oops! I spilled this bucket of pond<br/>water."<p>The panda said, "Burao! Bah-rah, bamuru!"<p>Ranma-chan laughed, "Sorry! I can't understand a word<br/>you're sayin'."<p>Nabiki entered the family room just as Kaneda was<br/>leaving, "I THOUGHT idea was not to fight Ranma with<br/>martial arts?"<p>On his way back out into the garden, he told her, "And<br/>it's hard not to! I'm trying to stay as unorthodox as I<br/>can."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi had enforced a truce within the house the next<br/>morning. If anybody or anything got wet, there would be<br/>no breakfast.<p>Ranma-chan ate sullenly while keeping her eyes on Kaneda.<p>Kaneda ate sullenly while keeping his eyes on his dad.<p>His dad just stared out into space.<p>Nabiki ate while looking bored at the whole situation.<p>Mr. Saotome remained a panda.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>On their way to school Kaneda kept his eye on Ranma-chan.<br/>The guy was walking the walls and fences again. "You<br/>didn't attack me in my sleep."<p>Ranma-chan said, surly, "I don't do things like that."<p>Kaneda continued his thread, "You also played fair and<br/>stayed within the Tendou compound."<p>Ranma-chan snorted, "I can't say the same for you!"<p>Kaneda got sore, "I did too! I never left the property!"<p>Ranma-chan accused, "Oh, yeah! Every couple a hours you<br/>disappeared!"<p>Kaneda told her, "That's because I had to REST! I don't<br/>have the stamina you have!"<p>Ranma-chan leaped down to confront him, "Some martial<br/>artist! Some guy!"<p>Though it hurt his pride, Kaneda was forced to say,<br/>"That's right! Compared to you I'm not a guy! I'm as weak<br/>and soft as a girl!"<p>Ranma-chan screamed in frustration. "Will you STOP<br/>reminding me of that!"<p>Splash!<p>The old woman with the ladle had gotten Ranma wet again.<p>Ranma-chan reacted with a pure look of revenge, "I'm wet!<br/>I've got water!"<p>Kaneda ran! -{Not now! Not now! I can't be a girl now!}-<br/>he told himself. At least HE had rested and gotten enough<br/>sleep yesterday and this morning.<p>Swerving and twisting as randomly as he could, Kaneda<br/>made it to Dr. Tofu's clinic.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda went out a back exit. -{Ranma doesn't know the<br/>streets like I do. I'll take a long way to school. Once I<br/>get there, it'll be too late for Ranma.}-<p>He kept looking over his shoulder, or spinning around as<br/>he hurried. He paused at each intersection and cautiously<br/>looked both ways. He then dashed across.<p>He hid behind concrete poles, mailboxes, trash bags, and<br/>just about anything that could give him cover.<p>All that remained at last was the long block with the<br/>business district on one end and the high school on the<br/>other.<p>He did some sprint and hide ninja tricks he'd seen on TV.<p>He came to the point where he could see the giant school<br/>clock. "Only eight twenty-six? I thought I was going to<br/>be later than that." He left the little niche in a wall<br/>its gate made, and hurried for the school's main gate.<p>Squirtch! Kaneda was hit by the high-powered water gun<br/>he'd used on Ranma yesterday.<p>Ranma-kun jumped down from the wall in front of him. "Ha!<br/>I thought you'd at least try and take another way in." He<br/>pocketed the gun.<p>Kaneda looked behind the guy at the school gate, -{So<br/>close!}- As he calculated how he was going to get by<br/>Ranma-kun and those last few meters, he said, "Where's<br/>your honor? You wouldn't let people know my secret?"<p>Ranma-kun rubbed his hands together, as he reminded him<br/>of the debt, "Like you risked MY secret yesterday!<br/>There were a whole lot of guys comin' and-"<p>PADDAPADDAPADDAPADDA! Came the rumble of tens of<br/>feet out of the main school building.<p>Wet Kaneda said, "The lookout gave them the signal!" And<br/>he lunged, ducked and managed to just get by the<br/>distracted Ranma-kun. He told him, "Red hair calls<br/>attention AWAY from the change! It HELPS you seem like<br/>another person!"<p>His battle aura intense, Ranma leaped after him, "Good! You<br/>have more of it! -Saotome Instant Hot Water Attack!" His<br/>amazingly quick reflexes caused his hands became a blur. With<br/>the aura's power and protection, they built up enough friction to<br/>heat the skin...AND water.<p>His hot hands shot out, and touched the top of Kaneda's<br/>wet head and shoulder. He could FEEL the water get hot.<p>Kaneda shrank. Her long red hair became black.<p>She was standing in the way of the attacking school<br/>athletes: "The game IS tennis, and I'm going to END your<br/>racket!"/ "You can't race away from this showdown!"/<br/>"I'll push you out of the champion's circle!" / "I'll<br/>prove dancers are athletes too!"<p>Kane-chan screamed-And leaped back into the surprised<br/>Ranma's arms. "You wouldn't hurt a girl, would you!"<p>The 26 guys in uniforms, most of them not the same as<br/>yesterday's, stopped to looked up and down the street.<br/>"What happened to Tendou?"/ "He finally ran out on a<br/>fight?"/ "I thought you said her couldn't race away"?"/<br/>"He broke the 100 meter dash!"/ "He is a coward!"/ "Yeah!<br/>After weeks of beating us up, he finally got tired of<br/>it!"/ "That means we won, doesn't it?"<p>Meanwhile Ranma-kun was trying to get Kane-chan off of<br/>him, "WHY did you do this, idiot! Can't you hear what<br/>they're callin' Kaneda!"<p>Kane-chan 'whimpered', "I'm not Kaneda. You'll protect<br/>me, won't you? You are a much better than Kaneda!" And<br/>she turned her head towards the crowd and yelled, "You're<br/>the BEST ATHLETE around!"<p>That got the attention of jocks hungry to prove<br/>themselves. "What did that girl say?"/ "Are you sure<br/>she's a girl? Look at how's she's dressed."/ "Oh, she's a<br/>girl alright, dummy!"/ "I wouldn't mind going asking her<br/>out."/ "You don't just ASK a girl like that out."<p>Kane-chan yelled, "I only go out with the best!" She<br/>stuck out her tongue, and then buried her face in Ranma-<br/>kun's chest. -{Please! Give me the strength not to<br/>puke!}-<p>PADDAPADDA! The horde of challengers charged at Ranma-<br/>kun. "She says she's the one who can take her away from<br/>her boyfriend!"/ "She's the PRIZE for the best athlete!"<p>Ranma-kun cried, "Now look what you did!"<p>Kane-chan fought the urge to giggle, "You're the one who<br/>wanted me to be a girl! And the Code says boys shouldn't<br/>fight a girl!"<p>A tennis player was in the lead, his racket ready to<br/>strike. Behind him was a rugby player...<p>Ranma-kun quickly tossed Kane-chan up towards the top of<br/>the school wall. He had just enough time duck the racket,<br/>elbow the guy in the gut and kick the rugby player at the<br/>same time. After that came the ju jitsuist...<p>Standing on the wall Kane-chan looked down at the<br/>fighting. He frowned, "That should be me. This stupid plan<br/>better work." She turned to the school grounds.<br/>"Nothing!" She looked at the people in the school windows<br/>watching the brawl. She saw Nabiki, looking grumpy<br/>because she'd only had a sponge bath.<p>The fight was almost over with and she was about to give<br/>up on her plan when: "Hey! Kuno! It's ME!" she waved<br/>at the guy in the black-and-blue standing on top of the<br/>clock's tower.<p>Kuno noticed, "The Girl with the Untamed Hair!"<p>Kane-chan called, "What are you doing up there! I<br/>challenged you! If you don't hurry up to get beaten, I'm<br/>leaving!"<p>Kuno yelled back, "I'm coming My Diana of the Hunt!" And<br/>he leaped from the height.<p>A surprised Kane-chan said, "He really IS an idiot!"<p>Kuno crashed through the foliage of a tree near the<br/>building.<p>Kane-chan turned away, "He'd better have had that<br/>planned." Not caring to find out one way or another if<br/>Kuno was going to escape serious injury, -{He's too much<br/>of an idiot not to survive.}- she looked to the streetside of<br/>the wall.<p>Down below the last guy to fall at Ranma-kun's feet<br/>asked, "Who, are, you?"<p>Cinching her belt, Kane-chan leaped down into Ranma-kun's<br/>arms. "He's my fiance!"<p>The girl stuck to him again, Ranma-kun screamed, "I<br/>ain't! I ain't nobody's fiance!"<p>Kane-chan leaned closer to him, "Oh, you'd rather be my<br/>fiancée, as in "bride-to-be"?"<p>Ranma-kun tried to shake, toss, cast, and peel the girl-<br/>form away from him. He even thought of putting her down<br/>where he could get a foothold on her. "How are you doing<br/>this!"<p>Making sure her arm was wrapped around his one free arm,<br/>she told him, "I learned it from a friend Nabiki once<br/>had. She had a crush on me. I call the technique<br/>Clinging-Vine-on-a-Statue."<p>Ranma-kun screamed, "I'm not a statue! I'm-"<p>Kuno cried, "You are an obstacle to what should<br/>rightfully belong to the Noble Kuno!" Twigs with leaves<br/>were sticking out of his gi.<p>Kane-chan told him, "I haven't beaten you yet!" She<br/>squeezed Ranma to her, "But I HAVE beaten my fiance, Kei<br/>Tendou!"<p>Ranma-kun cried, "You haven't beaten-" Ranma blinked, "<br/>"Kei Tendou"?"<p>She smiled a challenge at him, "That's your name...as<br/>surely as mine is Akane Saotome."<p>The End of this chapter
