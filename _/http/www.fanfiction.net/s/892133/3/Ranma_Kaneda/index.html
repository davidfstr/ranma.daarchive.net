</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>[Note: If the original body has certain recessive traits,<br/>the curse makes them dominant in the second. Ranma-chan's<br/>red hair comes from Ranma's mother. But if Ranma-chan were<br/>strictly his true female version, she would have black hair and<br/>gray eyes. Then why the changes? Kuno knows some of the<br/>lore.]<p>[Note: When I can, I've replaced the nameless bit players<br/>with Hiroshi, Daisuke, Sayuri and Yuka.]<p>03: School is No Place for Challenges<p>Kaneda asked, "Where do you think you're going?" He was<br/>in his school uniform and wet.<p>Ranma-chan told him, "I ain't gonna school like this."<br/>She was in her Chinese clothes and wet.<p>Kaneda said, "We, uh, can get some hot water from Dr.<br/>Tofu!"<p>The other redhead stopped to grumble, but turned around<br/>to follow.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The local clinic had signs outside that advertised<br/>"Acupressure, Acupuncture, Moxibustion". Kaneda informed<br/>the girl who was barely listening, "Dr. Tofu also knows<br/>several other techniques, but these are what most people<br/>want. He's also a trained GP."<p>Ranma-chan barely took the gloomy look off her face,<br/>"We'll see. I've run into my share of quacks in my<br/>travels."<p>Kaneda went inside and called, "Hello! Hello! Anybody<br/>here?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Oh, boy. Now I'm gonna be late.<p>He went into the infirmary, "Wait here. I'll get you the<br/>hot water."<p>Ranma-chan stayed at the doorway, "That's okay. Don't<br/>bother!"<p>Kaneda said, "You don't want to go to school as a girl."<p>Ranma said, "I thought you wanted me to." When he didn't<br/>answer, she sighed, "Oh, boy! What a way to start things<br/>out. Now I'm going to be late."<p>Suddenly she felt something lifeless and bony on her<br/>shoulder.<p>She screamed like a girl and jumped!<p>Her hands found the top of the open door and held on. Her<br/>slippers were as high up off the floor as she could get<br/>them without going into contortions.<p>A totally white, totally bony figure without skin or hair<br/>said in a high voice, "Pardon me!"<p>"Hm, hm, hm!" the tall man in glasses and a black do-gi<br/>laughed. "Hi, don't afraid! This is my skeleton, Beti.<br/>Lovely complexion, don't you think?"<p>Even when it she realized it was just a Halloween<br/>perversion of a Bunraku puppet show Ranma the great<br/>martial artist had not gotten over his fright.<p>Kaneda said, "How cute! Just like a girl."<p>Ranma tired to jump down and challenge that slur...but her<br/>fingers wouldn't let go of the door.<p>Kaneda gave a respectable bow, "Dr. Tofu, good morning to<br/>you."<p>The doctor returned the bow, though not as low, "Good<br/>morning to you."<p>Ranma managed to pry herself off the door, and land with<br/>some dignity on the floor.<p>But they weren't paying her any attention. Dr. Tofu said,<br/>"You haven't been by lately. Any new 'injuries'?"<p>Kaneda answered, "No. I've been very careful. I want to<br/>thank you for you helping me, again."<p>The man smiled, "I am your family physician. I'm here to<br/>do anything I to help a patient."<p>Ranma looked at the two. She became suspicious. It<br/>sounded like they were talking in code.<p>Kaneda said, "Then you won't mind if I borrow 'it'?" He<br/>glanced over at Ranma-chan. "I have somebody living with<br/>me that has the same problem."<p>She was about to protest on two counts. But why let a<br/>strange know any more than he did? When the man looked at<br/>her, she tried to keep from reddening any more.<p>Dr. Tofu smiled like a doctor now for her, "Of course,<br/>you may borrow it, Kaneda."<p>Then from the reception area, they heard another patient<br/>come in. "Dr. Tofu? Could you help me? My back has gone<br/>out again! I was lucky to make it this far!"<p>When the good doctor left the infirmary, Kaneda hurried<br/>to the sink to get the water. He gotten "it" while Ranma-<br/>chan was on the door. It was in his slacks pocket.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The two teen guys had to hurry if they were going to make<br/>it to school. While Kaneda ran along the narrow street,<br/>Ranma was up running on the cement privacy walls. Despite<br/>his speed he wasn't winded, "So that guy studies martial<br/>arts?"<p>Though a religious jogger, Kaneda was winded, "Hunh?<br/>How could you tell?"<p>Ranma the fighter analyzed what he remembered, "I can<br/>tell. Sneakin' up on me that way. I didn't even hear him<br/>comin'.<p>Kaneda said, "It's true. He's very good. He's a really<br/>strong martial artist. He certainly doesn't look it, does<br/>he?"<p>Kaneda had his own memories of the doctor, "Ever since I<br/>was little, whenever something was wrong HE'D always make<br/>it better."<p>Ranma jumped down to run beside Kaneda. "Hey, wait a<br/>minute. ' Sounds to me you might like this guy in a way<br/>GUYS aren't supposed to like other guys." It was both a<br/>tweak and a hope. If he could get Kaneda's girl-half<br/>interested in somebody else, he'd be rid of THAT problem.<p>Kaneda face and mood darkened. "I don't like guys, I HATE<br/>guys! Hate guys!" She looked at the school gate at the<br/>end of the corridor that was the street. "And I'll SHOW<br/>you how much I hate guys! -Look!"<p>Ranma looked and saw a horde of fit-looking teen guys<br/>dressed in just about every imaginable sports club a<br/>school could have charging out from the grounds in their<br/>direction. All had their own battle<br/>cry.<p>Ranma said, "Wha the-"<p>Splish!<p>Too late, Ranma-chan noticed "it". Kaneda had pointed an<br/>air-powered water gun at her at point blank range.<p>Kaneda had timed this so he could pick Ranma-chan up,<br/>carry her for a few paces, and toss her for the high<br/>concrete wall around the school before she or anybody<br/>else could fight him.<p>Ranma-chan landed feet first on top of the wall like a<br/>cat, and turned to yell, "Hey! What'd you do that..." Her<br/>voice trailed off when she Kaneda dodge a boxer and send<br/>his gloved punch at the panda. The panda wasn't<br/>prepared; it was still dealing with surprised attack of<br/>the fencer with two swords Kaneda had sent it.<p>Kaneda quickly had the fencer, and boxer out on the<br/>panda. Spilled hot water and an empty teakettle were on<br/>the ground, too.<p>Kaneda then leaped over the gate's threshold and, his<br/>longhair flying, single-handedly took on five tennis<br/>players, three rugby players, a hockey player, a<br/>wrestler, two martial artist, two baseball batters, one<br/>Greco-Roman and one sumo wrestler, two American football<br/>players, and a half-a-dozen others whose uniforms Ranma<br/>didn't recognize.<p>Ranma despite herself she had crouched down on the wall<br/>and watched. "He's something else. I didn't give him<br/>enough credit for knowing how to fight. But what's it all<br/>about?"<p>Nabiki called out from window seat she had on the second<br/>floor, "Ranma! Don't interfere, this is Kaneda's fight."<p>By force of training Ranma had to study everybody's moves<br/>and techniques. Anyone of them could be an opponent in<br/>the future. Kaneda had definitely shown himself to be<br/>one. ...Still, so many against one? He called back at<br/>Nabiki, "Yeah, but-"<p>Nabiki assured him, "It's OK! He knows what he's doing.<br/>This happens EVERY morning!"<p>Ranma looked at Kaneda with even more respect. Well,<br/>maybe not respect. The guy was showing off as he was<br/>beating up the 24 guys. He was putting in moves and<br/>techniques he didn't need to. They were a waste of time<br/>and effort.<p>Finally, everybody but Kaneda was laid low and<br/>motionless. The only sounds that could be heard were the<br/>cars in the background and Kaneda's panting. But instead<br/>of using his breathing exercises to replenish his energy,<br/>he wasted his breath by saying, "You'd think they<br/>would've all learned by now." Kaneda HAD been showing<br/>off. But Ranma hadn't been a girl long enough to see why<br/>he'd been doing it. The martial artist thought the "Heir<br/>to the Tendou Dojo" just wanted to prove to Ranma he did<br/>know how to fight.<p>Suddenly something came flying at Kaneda while he wasn't<br/>looking.<p>But he caught it: It was a metal gauntlet a European armored<br/>knight once wore. Kaneda raised his eyes and groaned, "Too<br/>much French food."<p>As the thunder of a storm rolled in, a distinctly male<br/>voice came out from behind the nearby tree. "What earthly<br/>matters not when honor withers on vines untested by<br/>night."<p>Ranma-chan wondered if that haiku was meant to mean<br/>anything.<p>The orator was dressed in a kendo-gi and holding his<br/>bokken/wooden sword down in one hand, "These...Weaklings!<br/>Such a boorish lot, truly. They fought for the privilege<br/>of being recognized as this school's top athlete ...if they<br/>could manage to defeat you, that is. What fools these<br/>mortals be."<p>Kaneda told the other, slightly taller boy, "Oh, Kuno, do<br/>we HAVE to go through this again?" He backed up towards<br/>the wall Ranma-chan was staring from.<p>Kuno readied his weapon, "Always! Though their quest was<br/>sparked by my own, my challenge is of a more noble nature<br/>than the rabble's." He approached Kaneda as a samurai<br/>stalks his prey, both hands on the sword, now. "I seek to<br/>eliminate the greatest lecher on the face of this<br/>unfortunate orb."<p>Ranma-chan jumped down beside the red haired boy,<br/>"Lecher? I KNEW you were a pervert!"<p>Kaneda told her, "Wait until you get to know Kuno before<br/>you judge me."<p>Kuno blinked at the pigtailed girl, "Fair Damsel! I would<br/>advice you steer wide berth of this...debaucher of women!"<p>Ranma-chan looked at Kaneda, "I've been too easy on you.<br/>Pervert doesn't even begin to cover what you are. No wonder<br/>you wanted me this way."<p>Kaneda grew angry enough to ignore Kuno, "It's not LIKE<br/>that! I'm NOT! I've never been! I only-"<p>Kuno gave his battle cry, "You force her to cross-<br/>dress!"<p>Reflexively, and because her keenly trained senses told<br/>her how close it was going to be, Ranma stepped in front<br/>of Kaneda. The pervert hadn't yet deserved an attack<br/>while he was worn and distracted. She stopped Kuno's<br/>bokken just in time: Trapping it along its sides between<br/>her palms.<p>Kuno was stunned. "That's not is how it is meant to<br/>be... The whole order of the world is turned upside down: By<br/>a, a FEMALE, this time..."<p>Kaneda cried, "Now, look what you've done!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Geez! If it's going to upset you guys<br/>that much." And she let go.<p>Kuno had gone from pushing to pulling to free his sword.<p>The sword came back and whacked him on the head. Hard.<p>Kuno refused to fall.<p>Kaneda told Ranma-chan, "Kuno's hardheaded. We won't get<br/>to the front doors before he's after us."<p>Ranma looked around for an idea. She got it, "He likes<br/>trees, does he?" For somebody who fought a giant panda,<br/>picking up the teenage boy wasn't too much of an effort.<p>Kaneda saw where she was dragging Kuno, and picked up by<br/>his ankles.<p>By the time Kuno had stirred, he'd been tossed up over a<br/>limb of the tree he'd been hiding behind.<p>Kaneda looked up at the giant clock on the school's<br/>tower. "We're already late!" And he picked Ranma-chan up<br/>in his arms and carried her towards the threshold of her<br/>new school.<p>Ranma-chan cried, hitting at him with her little fists,<br/>"Let me go, you womanizer! I ain't gonna school like<br/>this!"<p>The blows hurt, but not enough to make Kaneda let her go,<br/>not when he was so close to getting her just where he<br/>wanted her. "Remember, Ranma, I'm really a girl! Your<br/>Code doesn't let you beat up girls!"<p>Ranma reared back her head, and bellowed, "What about<br/>YOUR Code!"<p>Kaneda's twisted logic was, "But YOU'RE not a girl,<br/>right?"<p>WHONG! Kuno had fallen out of the tree just then. A<br/>second person joined Kaneda in Ranma's entourage.<p>The thunder roared, and the lightning flashed: *KRAKKA!*<br/>RRRRMMMM!<p>Looking at the scene upside down on his throbbing head,<br/>he said, "That infamous lecher Kaneda has stolen away the<br/>fiery maiden! It is the Rape of the Sabine Women all over<br/>again! The distressed damsel needs rescuing!" He finally<br/>toppled over, and rolled-until he was sitting up, his hand<br/>reaching to his sword. "It looks again as if only the one<br/>true samurai around, Tatewaki Kuno, the Blue Thunder<br/>of Furinkan High, has the fortitude to take on and punish<br/>the moral degenerate Kaneda Tendou!"<p>Nabiki rested her chin in her hand as she gazed down at<br/>the captain of the school's kendo club. "I think zealots<br/>are far more dangerous than perverts."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Inside Room 1-F, the middle-aged teacher read from the<br/>form he was given and announced to the class, "It seems<br/>we have a new student here at Furinkan High. Her name is<br/>Ranma Saotome...an unusual name for a girl. She's just<br/>returned from China. So let's all give her a warm nihao<br/>welcome."<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke led the stirs among the boys; Sayuri<br/>and Yuka led grumbles from the girls.<p>The teacher added, "However, that does not excuse the<br/>fact that she and Kaneda Tendou were late. So go stand in<br/>the hall."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>They stood in silence for a few minutes, holding their<br/>buckets of water, and looking out the third floor window.<br/>The storm had left as quickly as it had come. The sun was<br/>bright.<p>Ranma-chan couldn't remain quiet. "This is all your<br/>fault."<p>Kaneda said, "Not entirely. Nabiki has favors out all<br/>over school. When she saw that you came as a girl, she<br/>must have been prepared to call one in and had them<br/>change your sex on the records."<p>Ranma grumbled, low and menacing, "It's a conspiracy. I<br/>bet it started before I got to China."<p>Kaneda cleared his throat, and ventured, "Look, Ranma,<br/>I'm not really a pervert. Kuno just thinks so because-"<p>Ranma snapped, quietly, "I don't care what HE thinks you<br/>are. I KNOW you're a pervert. What I WANNA know is-what<br/>were you doin' shooting me like that!"<p>Kaneda said, "Shoot you! It was just a high-powered<br/>water gun."<p>It was Ranma's turn to, "SHH! Keep it quiet. And I KNOW<br/>it was a water gun: That's why I'm a girl."<p>Kaneda said, "You know Dr. Tofu's a martial artist." He<br/>looked towards the windows. "Well, he's also been my<br/>coach. He really doesn't have the time to be my sensei,<br/>but he does give me help. Without him, I wouldn't be<br/>nearly the martial artist I am today."<p>Ranma said, "Stop the cello music, and tell me about that<br/>"it" of yours."<p>Kaneda glanced around then looked over his shoulder.<br/>There was no one near the windows that looked into the<br/>classroom. He looked back, and down into the bucket. "He<br/>IS my doctor. He knows about my...problem. He shoots the<br/>gun at me so I can practice getting out of the way of<br/>water."<p>Ranma almost bought it. "But as long as you WANNA be a<br/>guy, you don't HAFTA keep away from cold water."<p>Kaneda looked into his bucket, "You haven't had the<br/>problem long enough, I guess. I'm always getting splashed<br/>with water for no good reason: Out of nowhere, when I<br/>least expect it. True it's usually cold and doesn't<br/>change me, but it does get annoying." He held up the<br/>bucket, careful to keep it away from him, "I don't know<br/>how, I don't know when, but I'm willing to bet with<br/>Nabiki that I get splashed with this water."<p>Ranma still hated him for making everybody at this school<br/>think she was a girl, but at least she saw that point.<br/>Ever since she started having her water problem, it was<br/>hard staying dry.<p>Kaneda said, "Now, I'm going to tell you why Kuno's after<br/>me."<p>Ranma turned her head away, and hummed<p>Kaneda continued anyway, "At the beginning of the<br/>semester, Kuno made this stupid speech..."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>At "The Voice of Youth" Public Speaking Contest, Kuno<br/>slammed his palm down on the podium to demand the<br/>attention of the audience. "The Vengeance of Heaven is<br/>the duty of the samurai! Thus it has been through time<br/>immemorial in this, the Most Noble of Lands, Our Japan.<p>"...Am I making myself absolutely clear!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda fell silent. His face hidden behind his long hair.<p>Ranma-chan was left to pretend she hadn't heard what she<br/>didn't understand.<p>Finally, she had to say, "So! What does that hafta do<br/>with anything!"<p>Kaneda turned to Ranma, "You're a martial artist. You<br/>know how they were developed by Buddhist monks and taught<br/>to anybody willing to train. The idea challenged the idea<br/>of a warrior class."<p>Ranma nodded, "And martial arts were highly developed in<br/>Okinawa, where the samurai forbid the peasants to use any<br/>weapon."<p>Kaneda said, "There has been an ages old contest between<br/>certain samurai and what we represent. Of all the<br/>students here at Furinkan, I am the only one whose family<br/>has a dojo."<p>Kaneda bowed his head, "...And I was the next one scheduled<br/>to speak..."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>As Kaneda walked towards the podium, Kuno was walking<br/>back to his seat. He cried, "Be warned, varlet!" and<br/>slashed down with his sword.<p>Kameda stopped it between his bare hands.<p>...There, on stage, in front of the assembled school. Soon<br/>the whole town would know...and further.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda asked, "Have you ever seen or read "Urusei<br/>Yatsura"? Rumiko Takahashi's story about Lum, the green-<br/>haired alien girl with powers?"<p>The red-haired Ranma-chan said, "No. I've heard of it.<br/>Pop's cheap. If I read any manga, it's borrowed. And I<br/>never had a TV what with our travelin' for ten years. And<br/>just about the only movies Pop'll let me see has martial<br/>arts in it."<p>Kaneda said, "Well, in it there's this rich samurai,<br/>Shutaro Mendou. His sworn enemy, Ataru Moroboshi, is<br/>always stopping him from killing him with a real sword."<p>Ranma-chan 'guessed', "With his bare hands"."<p>Kaneda nodded, "And feet, and just about every other<br/>way." Ranma looked down at her very loose slippers. She<br/>remembered moves like that in one or two martial arts movies.<br/>She'd never yet let herself be in a position where she had to<br/>use the technique herself.<p>Kaneda said, "Well, the Lum Fan Club noticed the<br/>similarity in technique. But to Kuno that made me<br/>immediately like Moroboshi in EVERY way. And he was the<br/>biggest lecher in the Galaxy."<p>Ranma-chan blinked at him with her big blue eyes. "You're<br/>kidding."<p>Kaneda said, "I wish I were. But Kuno doesn't kid. He's<br/>insane, but he doesn't kid."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>In Room 2-E, Kuno was dressed in the same school uniform<br/>as Kaneda. The sempai/upperclassman cried, "Fiancee!<br/>She's, his, fiancée!"<p>Sitting next to him, Nabiki Tendou said, "Unh, hunh, our<br/>daddies decided since before they were born the son would<br/>marry a daughter of the two families. And Ranma's an only<br/>child."<p>Kuno raised his fists in fury, "Mm-Vah! Not KANEDA!" -<br/>he slammed both hands down on his desk.<p>The teacher threw a piece of chalk hard enough that it<br/>snapped the teen's head back as it broke against it. It<br/>did not help the headache that went down to his heart.<br/>"Kuno! Go stand in the hall!"<p>Nabiki was looking away and innocent. She hoped her plan<br/>would do something to help get Kuno off of Kaneda's back.<br/>But she hadn't had the chance to get to the part where<br/>Kaneda had 'decided to stop being a lecher and settle<br/>down'.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda was still looking glum. "Sometimes I think Kuno<br/>would be different if he had something to take his mind<br/>off of the History, Antiques and Code of the Samurai. A<br/>girl, maybe."<p>Ranma-chan looked at guy standing beside her, and<br/>remembered he was a she, "You mean a guy who looks like<br/>that, doesn't have a girlfriend?"<p>Kaneda said, "Handsome, rich, cultured, connected...the<br/>list goes on. But I don't think he's ever even been on a<br/>date."<p>That gave Ranma-chan another chance, " "A list", hunh? Do<br/>anything on the list ever make you wish you were a-"<p>Splash!<p>Suddenly Ranma-chan was damp on one side. But it was<br/>Kaneda that was wet. He held up the even fuller bucket he<br/>was holding, "Another bet I would've lost to Nabiki."<p>Kuno was back in his black-under-blue kendo-gi, and in<br/>the stance of just having tossed water from his bucket.<br/>His weapon of choice, the bokken, was slung over his<br/>back. "Never Kaneda Tendou!"<p>Kaneda groaned, "Not again, Kuno."<p>Kuno continued in a serious rumble, "I shall never accept<br/>your engagement to Ranma, nor any other fair flower! I<br/>Tatewaki Kuno shall never allow you to prey upon the<br/>innocent!"<p>Ranma tossed her bucket straight at the samurai-kid,<br/>"Hey, you jerk! I ain't-"<p>Kuno sliced through both bucket and water with his wooden<br/>sword.<p>And the windows of the classroom slid open. Their<br/>classmates squeezed their bodies out, boys on one side,<br/>girls on the other: "Kaneda has a girl!"/ "His dad had<br/>to pick her, I'll bet!"/ "Jealous? Look at her!"/ "She looks<br/>like she'd rather be a guy."/ "What better girl for<br/>Kaneda!"/ "Be careful what you say around her."/ "Yeah!<br/>She's a martial artist, too!"/ "Don't listen to those idiots,<br/>Ranma."/ "Right, we'll help you fit in with us girls."/ "I know<br/>just what your complexion needs!"/ "Oo, red hair! Do you<br/>dye it?"/ "Why didn't they give you a school dress?"/<br/>"Yeah! I want to see her legs!"/ "I want to see her panties!"...<p>Ranma-chan screamed, "That does it!" And she issued her<br/>challenge to Kuno, "I ain't interested in ANY jerk. I may<br/>not be able to beat up Kaneda, but I ain't got no problem<br/>doin' it to you!"<p>Kuno stood there confused. "What?"<p>Ranma-chan walked past him. "This is no place for a<br/>fight, Kuno. If you want to fight, follow me."<p>Kuno's throbbing head and heart began to pound, "She<br/>would date with me! She has issued a challenge in the<br/>manner of the Valkyrie! Then, when I am fallen in<br/>battle, she will sweep me up to Valhalla: Paradise of<br/>Heroes!"<p>(It was Kaneda's turn to be confused, "Japanese folklore<br/>aren't enough for him? He has to use Western ones, too?")<p>Ranma-chan yelled back at Kuno, "I don't know what you're<br/>talkin' about! I ain't a Valkyries: I'm Ranma Saotome of<br/>the Anything-Goes School of Martial Arts! Now, are you<br/>gonna fight me, or not!"<p>The already smitten Kuno answered, "That I shall, My<br/>Brunhilde!"<p>(Hiroshi said, "I always thought Brunhilde was more<br/>zaftig than that."<p>Daisuke said, "I'd rather my battle maidens be petit,<br/>anyway.")<p>Suddenly Kaneda realized, "Wait, Ranma!" He began to run<br/>after them, "Ranma! Beat Kuno up all you want-But DON'T<br/>win!"<p>From down the hall Ranma called back, "Ranma Saotome<br/>never loses!"<p>Kaneda called, "Fine! Just don't win!" But his shout was<br/>lost among those of the students pouring out of the 1-F's<br/>windows into the hall behind him: "Now the jerk's going<br/>to fight a girl!"/ "She's the one who wanted the fight!"/<br/>"That's because she wants him!"/ "KUNO! Why would ANY<br/>girl in her right mind-"/ "She ISN'T in her right mind,<br/>if she WANTS to fight!"/ "But when Kuno wins, he can't<br/>ask her out!"/ "But what if she wins!"/ "Then she ISN'T<br/>in her right mind!"...<p>Kaneda picked up his speed to sprint out ahead of crowd,<br/>"Ranma!"<p>Ranma-chan heard and saw all of the commotion over her<br/>shoulder. She raced to an open sliding window. "Here's a<br/>nice short cut," she told Kuno as she leaped out of it.<p>Kuno leaped after.<p>Panic pumped adrenaline into Kaneda's body, "When I said<br/>you needed a girl, I didn't mean RANMA!"<p>Before his brain had caught up with his body, he'd leaped<br/>out the window himself.<p>He heard Daisuke, above, say, "Hey, this is the third<br/>floor!"<p>Too late he heard Ranma-chan, below, say, "Water! Even<br/>when all it can do is make me wet, it's THERE!"<p>Far too late he heard Hiroshi pointed out, "Look, they're<br/>going to land in the pool." Kaneda's doom was sealed.<p>SPLASH!<p>SPLASHHHH!<p>KER-SPLASHHHH!<p>Hiroshi announced, "Look! Kuno's floating to the<br/>surface."<p>Daisuke did color, "Yeah, but where's Saotome!"<p>Yuka asked, "Where's Kaneda?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan swam. "Gotta get out! ' Can't stand being<br/>wet!"<p>Kuno saw her from the surface, "Ranma, I fight on! Defeat<br/>me!"<p>He swam for her, his hands reaching for more than just<br/>water. He grabbed a bare arm. He spun her around to face<br/>him.<p>That's when Ranma-chan caught sight of the flailing<br/>movement of somebody sinking to the bottom: Kaneda!<p>Ranma-chan broke Kuno's hold. She brought her legs up,<br/>and pushed off against him at the correct angle! She then<br/>swam harder than she would if she were a guy, "Girls<br/>WOULD be more buoyant!"<p>Kuno saw the girl he would make a lady put all of her<br/>thought on the task of saving the vile Kaneda Tendou. "Of<br/>course! Red hair, as with twins, are eldritch! The ally<br/>of demons has placed his mark upon her head to enslave<br/>her!"<p>But his expressed thoughts had taken that last of his<br/>air. He would have to drown the evil sorcerer after he'd<br/>been brought to the surface.<p>What he found when he raised his head above the water was<br/>a very wet panda. And it was holding a...teakettle?<p>The girl he'd only momentarily forgotten yelled out,<br/>"Hey, Pop! Help me with Kaneda!"<p>Kuno said, "The beast is the demon! I shall retake your-<p>Ranma-chan didn't want him taking ANYthing of hers: She<br/>knocked him across the pool...where he managed to get<br/>entangled in the ladder out.<p>When Ranma-chan looked, the panda was still holding up<br/>its sign, [Why help him? Look what he's done to you!]<p>Ranma-chan had pulled Kaneda over near the pool's edge,<br/>"Well, for one, how's your friend gonna take it if you<br/>let his kid stay drowned!"<p>Bending to reason, the panda lift the two out of the pool<br/>together.<p>But it put them both over its shoulders, held them there<br/>with his paws and took off!<p>Ranma yelled, "Pop! You're not helpin'!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Lucky for Kaneda he wasn't as 'drowned' as might have<br/>been suspected. The rough trip to the school's empty<br/>athletic fields had forced him to cough up most of the<br/>water he'd taken in.<p>When he was finally laid down among a few trees out of<br/>sight of most of the school. Ranma-chan had jumped off<br/>his pop. "I'll hit you in the gut to get the rest of the<br/>water out. But don't expect me to put my lips on yours!"<br/>Ranma was surprised she was upset that the jerk had<br/>nearly killed himself.<p>Kaneda tried to say something, but hadn't quite the<br/>breath for it. He heard Ranma-chan say, "Don't go back<br/>for the teakettle, Pop! I'm wet and this wind'll just<br/>cool the hot water."<p>But the panda didn't listen, of course.<p>Glowering after the creature, Ranma-chan took off her<br/>pants. "You'd think THIS'd be enough of an excuse not to<br/>go back inside!" On guard against anything girly, she did<br/>her best to she forget she wasn't a guy.<p>Kaneda looked at her legs and drew his breath in. - And<br/>coughed!<p>Getting her feet out, Ranma-chan scowled, "That WAS<br/>stupid! Jumpin' in like that when you can't swim!"<p>Kaneda groaned: Another black mark against him in Ranma's<br/>eyes. "I *Cough!* was trying to warn you. I, uh, have<br/>been fighting Kuno longer than you have."<p>Ranma's opinion of the Kaneda was only slightly raised.<br/>But, "I know how to pick up on an opponents style while<br/>we fight. I've been in enough of them." She twisted the<br/>pants and squeezed the water out. "He doesn't have a<br/>special technique, does he?"<p>Kaneda said, "Other than being too stupid to know when to<br/>quit?" He shook his head. He sat up, "But it's Kuno's<br/>MOTVATION that's the threat!"<p>Ranma felt the pants, and bent over to put them back on.<br/>I've never been any good about understanding motivations.<br/>You hafta fight no matter why you do." Kaneda got a good<br/>look at her boxer shorts.<p>He blushed and turned away, trying not to think about<br/>what the pigtailed girl's ass would look like in panties.<br/>"You know that YOU challenged HIM?"<p>Pulling up the damp pants Ranma said, "Yeah. So?"<p>Kaneda stood up, still looking away, "What happens when<br/>you win a fight?"<p>Ranma started unfastening her Chinese shirt, "I send them<br/>away. I don't want to see them again until they've<br/>learned their lesson." Of course, sometimes it didn't<br/>work out that way.<p>Kaneda said, "That's OUR Code. "The Anything-Goes School<br/>of Martial Arts Code of Grace". We repeat their name to<br/>show respect, not arrogance.<p>"But that's NOT Kuno's Code..." Kaneda turned around, saw<br/>Ranma-chan's bared boobs, and immediately turned around<br/>again. "If you defeat him, HE thinks you have to date<br/>him."<p>Ranma-chan spun him back around, "That's HIS problem! I'm<br/>not gonna do that with any guy, even OVER my beaten<br/>body!"<p>Ranma was demanding Kaneda look at her in the eye, as if<br/>she were a guy. Kaneda began to sweat as he struggled to<br/>keep his eyes from lowering past her face. His thoughts<br/>started to wonder, too, "Well, there's your reputation...as<br/>a, fighter, that is. Kuno will spread the, uh, word that<br/>you broke honor, and you'll lose shirt-I mean lose face<br/>between, I mean-"<p>Ranma-chan glared intensely at him. She grabbed him by<br/>his white shirt and yanked him down to her level. She<br/>snarled, "How come you're DRY!"<p>Kaneda looked down at the still damp, and topless, girl.<br/>"How come you aren't?"<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "Because I went for a SWIM!" The force<br/>of her answer caused her boobs to bob.<p>Kaneda tore his eyes away, and tried to gently pry her<br/>little fists off of his shirt. "It just happens! It<br/>doesn't always happen this quick. It doesn't happen when<br/>I think about it too hard. I thought it might have to do<br/>with my red hair. Red hair appears all around the world,<br/>and they're often thought to have powers."<p>Ranma-chan let him get loose. But her mood hadn't<br/>changed, "Magic! Damned thing mocks ALL the laws of<br/>physics! Once the curse gets you wet it doesn't need to<br/>stay. It probably goes to the same place Pop gets his<br/>signs." Ranma remembered that Pop hadn't pulled his first<br/>written sign out of thin air until he met his first<br/>countryman. The sheer frustration of not being able to<br/>communicate with another Japanese did it. "As long as you<br/>stay cursed, it lets your subconscious do some things,<br/>I'll bet." The curse gave you greater access to 'hammer<br/>space' than others, perhaps.<p>PO-UR!<p>The panda had returned with the teakettle. Kaneda no<br/>longer had to pretend that Ranma's boobs weren't a<br/>bother. But Kane-chan had to pretend HER boobs weren't a<br/>bother.<p>She also had to grab her slacks to keep them from falling<br/>down.<p>Kane-chan cried, "Why did you do that!"<p>The panda held up a green flag, and waved it.<p>Kuno's voice cried, "The signal!"<p>The shirtless Ranma-kun yelled, "Pop! What'd you go and<br/>do that for! ' You TRYIN' to sic Kuno on Kaneda!"<p>The panda held up its sign, [What's good for the gander<br/>is good for the goose.]<p>Ranma-kun gaze went back to Kane-chan, "I can't say she<br/>doesn't have it comin'." Then he shoved her away. "But<br/>all she did was turn me into a girl. It's MY fault Kuno's<br/>after me." He set about for the nearest puddle. "And I<br/>ain't run away from a fight, yet." Not for long, anyway.<p>The panda threw itself over the puddle on its back. It<br/>raised its long sharp claws to protest its son decision<br/>to be a girl.<p>Ranma-kun yelled at it, "There's plenty more water out<br/>here! We just had a storm!"<p>Suddenly: "Hey! Look at ME, Kuno!"<p>Ranma-kun groaned. He didn't want to look. That idiot<br/>wasn't...?<p>Still dripping wet, Kuno's eyes nearly popped out of<br/>their sockets when he saw the topless girl finding the<br/>extra hole in her belt. "Miss! I do not know why you<br/>address me in this, uh, manner, but it is not, uh,<br/>proper..."<p>Her pants secure, Kane-chan said, "Do you remember me?"<p>Kuno struggled to put his gaze on her face. "Uh, yes. I<br/>do believe I, uh, have. Seen you, that is. (Though not<br/>this much of you.)"<p>The longhaired girl struck her pose, hands up, but hiding<br/>nothing. "My name is Akane Saotome: And I challenge you!"<p>The End of this chapter
