You survived?" `<p>Ichie, Nabiki's Second Vice President and Treasurer, rose in her<br/>seat, "Again?" She wasn't the only one in class to voice their<br/>surprise.<p>The English teacher ordered, "Miss Gojo! Miss Ichijo! It is<br/>still class time!" The pudgy Mr. Ohara turned his hard, critical<br/>eye towards the one who had entered in the middle of his lesson.<p>Nabiki, trying to look modestly smug, said, "I just returned<br/>from seeing the new principal. She liked my suggestions."<p>Mr. Ohara was obviously yet to be one of Miss Hinako's fans. But<br/>he motioned for Miss Tendou to take her seat. He then told Miss<br/>Gojo, "Proceed with your report on Adam Smith's "The Wealth of<br/>Nations"."<p>First Vice President and Secretary Tsugako continued, "Er...<br/>"Greed is good. It is there on both sides of the equation,<br/>demand as well as supply"..."<p>Ichie, the cute girl with the bowl hairdo, glanced around at her<br/>President, before returning her eyes towards the front of the<br/>room. She said in as quiet a voice as she could, "Well?"<p>Nabiki said, seemingly as calm and in-charge as ever, "A little<br/>aikido."<p>Ichie whispered, "I thought the "School of Anything-Goes"<br/>teaches... Never mind. Ask a stupid question." She risked<br/>turned around to look at Nabiki, "I thought you stopped your<br/>martial arts practices."<p>Nabiki nodded, and said as if she had a secret, "All but one.<br/>And I don't "practice" it." A serious look washed over her face,<br/>"But I can't practice it as much as I'd like." A shudder went<br/>through her. "I have to be very careful about when I use my<br/>aikido."<p>Ichie looked at her, "How very cryptic." But she made the pinky-<br/>swear sign, "But I promise to keep it our secret weapon."<p>Mr. Ohara called, "Nabiki Tendou, we shall hear YOUR extra<br/>credit book report now!" Tsugako was already on her way back to<br/>her own seat.<p>Despite the teacher's wish to embarrass her, Nabiki wasn't<br/>caught off-guard. She got her report from her bookbag, and went<br/>to stand in front of the classroom.<p>Nabiki reported in an English that was less heavily accented as<br/>the others in her classroom, "As Mr. Ohara has only specified<br/>that our reading must be at a certain level of proficiency, I<br/>have chosen to report on a classic. A science fiction classic."<br/>The class muttered briefly among themselves. They didn't think<br/>science fiction was Nabiki's usual taste. Nabiki enjoyed keeping<br/>people wondering about her; it helped keep them off balance. She<br/>read from her report, " "The Foundation", by Isaac Asimov"..."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>When the class time was over, and free time had begun, the Vice-<br/>President of the Sci-Fi club hurried over to try and recruit a<br/>new member. There was a knot of people had already started to<br/>form around her, asking her questions. But she, as usual, was<br/>careful not to be too specific about anything. ` Hiro Mirioka<br/>said, "Nabiki Tendou! I didn't know you liked what we like!"<p>Miss Tendou informed him, "I don't. "The Foundation Trilogy"<br/>just had something about it I could relate to."<p>Hiro tried to draw her into his universe, "Like, maybe, "The<br/>Mule"? HE could change they way people think just by looking at<br/>them!"<p>Miss Tendou laughed, "I am NO Mule. He nearly ended up ruling<br/>the galaxy, and at a young age. If *I* had his power don't you<br/>think I would be the lord of at LEAST Nerima by now?"<p>Those that had been listening laughed and agreed. Nabiki was<br/>pleased with herself. She thought she had planted a seed she<br/>could use WITHOUT revealing the truth. ` And even if they did<br/>know the truth, people like Ranma would have to be far more<br/>emotionally balanced to be any real threat to her. `<p>Standing in the corner, apart from others, Ichie didn't laugh so<br/>hard. She knew enough from Nabiki that martial artists tried to<br/>put emotional force behind their chi attacks. She whispered to<br/>herself, "Aikido deflects the force aimed at it..." Ichie<br/>looked at her leader in a new light. "No wonder she acts so<br/>coolly, without much emotional force. It must be how she keeps<br/>herself grounded, and ready to use a person's own emotional<br/>energy against them." She shuddered, "What could have caused her<br/>to develop that skill SO well! I didn't think she put herself<br/>in that much danger!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>`<br/>Ranma-chan had lost the first round of the competition. ` For<br/>now she was waiting in the shoe locker room. This time she had<br/>her indoor slippers on.<p>She checked the clock again. She remembered the school had<br/>returned to the normal ten-minute free time between periods.<br/>Fourth period would begin soon; she headed up to Classroom 1-F<br/>talking to herself. She was fuming so badly she repeated some of<br/>what was said by the others, "And little miss "I-don't-go-to-<br/>school-here" volunteers to go get everything that brat "Miss<br/>Hinako" needs for her tree house! "Don't worry," "Akane-chan"<br/>says, "I know all about carpentry! I helped build a dojo: More<br/>than ONCE!". And off she goes to the hardware store."<p>"MEANWHILE, *I* have to return to classes "like a"-gag!-"good<br/>girl" until the kid-head-master decides to give me permission to<br/>get out of them! "I'll talk to your tannin/homeroom teacher to<br/>make SURE you don't play skip school again!"."<p>"At LEAST I made sure Akane left the school grounds. If she<br/>keeps her word, I SHOULD be back when she gets back by<br/>lunchtime." She frowned though, "She better not sneak back and<br/>try to learn that Hinako-brat's secrets before ME!"<p>In her agitation, Ranma-chan had walked faster than she'd<br/>planned. She came into the classroom a couple of minutes before<br/>the bell:<p>Hiroshi noticed her first, "Wow! Ranma, you're still in your<br/>Chinese clothes! Did you get special permission, after all?"<p>Daisuke said, "I wouldn't have thought you knew how to handle<br/>little kids, Ranma."<p>Hiroshi said to his friend, "Aw, Daisuke, don't you know that<br/>girls are just better at dealing with kids!"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "I'm NOT good with kids!"<p>Sayuri told the jerks, "Leave her alone! Didn't you HEAR what<br/>her father did to the poor thing!"<p>Yuka reminded them, "He raised her to believe she was a guy!"<p>Hiroshi looked at Ranma-chan. "Puberty must've come as a<br/>surprise." Even in the baggy clothes, her figure was well<br/>rounded.<p>The bell rang. Mr. Suzuki teacher told them to be, "Quite,<br/>class! Time to be in your seats! Life and Environment Studies<br/>will be about the differences between mammals and the other<br/>animals..."<p>Almost growling, Ranma-chan went to hers, saying to the others,<br/>"Ain't anybody gonna ask where's Kaneda! Why am I the only one<br/>who hasta have good attendance?"<p>But the teacher didn't ignore "Mr. Absent".<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>As soon as Ranma-chan's fourth period was over with, she bounded<br/>out of the classroom door. Anything or one that got in her way,<br/>she just jumped over.<p>Daisuke asked, "What is HER problem? She ducked out on us all of<br/>Friday's free periods, too."<p>Hiroshi said, "Maybe she HAS to keep going. You know, "female<br/>problems"."<p>Sayuri glared at the jerks, "And what do YOU two know about<br/>that!"<p>Hiroshi said, "I KNOW my grandmother has problems like that! She<br/>has to wear diapers."<p>Daisuke said, "Oh, Dude! That much about girls, I DON'T want to<br/>know!"<p>Sayuri said, "Don't you GUYS bother to listen to a girl? Ranma<br/>said she has to meet with the new principal, again."<p>Yuka reported from the hallway outside the door, "If Ranma is,<br/>she's stopping off in the girls' room first."<p>Sayuri cried, "Yuka! You don't say things like that in front of<br/>guys!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Classroom 1-F was eating their lunches and goofing off in their<br/>various ways when Nabiki Tendou came in. Somehow she knew the<br/>teacher wouldn't be there.<p>She knew Hiroshi and Daisuke, and it wasn't hard to find them. She<br/>approached the teens standing off to the side, assessing the girls,<br/>"You're Kaneda's friends, aren't you?"<p>Daisuke Koyasu was a little disappointed by what he looked at her,<br/>"You're wearing the school's uniform again."<p>Hiroshi Tsujitani said, "Even Nabiki Tendou has to surrender to<br/>the dress code."<p>Nabiki had no intention of telling them the truth. She had only<br/>told everybody to ignore the dress code to draw attention to<br/>Ranma's Chinese clothes. And it had worked. That had been one of<br/>the conditions the teachers had gotten out of the new principal.<br/>Miss Hinako was now on notice that for them to recognize her as<br/>their principal, she would have to enforce the dress code. And<br/>that meant dresses for ALL girls.<p>Nabiki said, "I DID say I could change the code. Well, that should<br/>argue against me having any special powers." And make for the<br/>perfect emotional tension about her: Can she, or can't she? It left<br/>them more off-balanced around her.<p>Daisuke asked, suspiciously, "What ARE you here for? Gambling,<br/>or are you selling something?"<p>Nabiki acted a little hurt, "Is money the ONLY thing you think I<br/>care about? What about family? I DO think of my little brother."<p>Daisuke said, "Yes, he's told us what you think of him."<p>Nabiki made to leave, "Okay, then, if you don't want to do come<br/>to the party we're having for Kaneda's fiancée!..."<p>Hiroshi said, "For Ranma?"<p>Yuka, too, said, "A party for Ranma? What kind is it? A welcome<br/>to neighborhood party?"<p>Nabiki smiled. The final part of her grand scheme was about to fall<br/>into place. After this the profits could start coming. And the best<br/>part was that after she'd gotten made money on Ranma as a girl,<br/>she'd make money on Ranma as a guy. (Though there WERE reasons<br/>why she might not want to cash in on Ranma's male opportunity.)<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>`<br/>Ranma-chan was approaching the strand of trees where,<br/>supposedly, the kid-principal still was. She was hurrying.<br/>Lunchtime was only 45 minutes. If she were lucky, though, she'd<br/>be able to get an excuse from the principal and miss the<br/>afternoon classes.<p>But Ranma-chan was still thinking about the indignity of being a<br/>girl. ` The three minutes she'd struggled to do what she had to<br/>do in the girls' room had made her even MORE upset about having<br/>to stay in a girl's body. "I BETTER learn this technique!...And<br/>I BETTER not hafta be a girl to do it!...I'm gonna find a cure<br/>to this curse! What a waste of pride it'd be, then! 'Cause,<br/>right now, NO technique's powerful enough for me to give up my<br/>manhood to use!" To LEARN was apparently another thing.<p>Kane-chan up ahead called to her, "You're talking to yourself!<br/>Everybody can hear you!" She was in her schoolgirl's uniform.<br/>But she also had a canvass carpenter's apron on.<p>Ranma-chan called back, "So what! Your assassin sister's got<br/>people believing I'm half crazy, anyway!"<p>Kane-chan said, "Better half, than fully!"<p>Ranma-chan noticed that the pre-cut planks, beams, siding,<br/>shingles, boxes of nails and spikes, tools and other stuff had<br/>already been delivered. The remarkable show of ability to get<br/>this done in such a short time made Ranma start to wonder about<br/>how deeply Kaneda was involved in Nabiki's scheming. Then,<br/>again, the family knew how to work quickly. It WAS only 5 days<br/>since she'd arrived at their house. "You're really enjoying this<br/>happenin' to me, ain'tcha!"<p>Kane-chan told her, "No, I don't: Honest! But I do know you<br/>weren't happy with your life before you met me!"<p>Ranma-chan told him, "I was happier than I am now!"<p>Kane-chan said, "You haven't given yourself the chance to try<br/>being a girl!"<p>Ranma-chan raised a fist, "That's, because, I'm, a, GUY!"<p>Approaching from the main building, Miss Hinako said, "I sense<br/>aggression!"<p>Ranma-chan forced her fist to unclench. "Man! If I didn't think<br/>you might get the secret of her technique before me, I just<br/>might forget about my code about hittin' girls. Your sister's<br/>certainly pushed me to the limit!"<p>Kane-chan was torn up inside, There is a way I could ease her<br/>pain. But even if *I* were ready to tell her, she's not ready to<br/>hear how changing her name to Kei Tendou could make her happier<br/>than being Ranma Saotome, girl...or guy.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>`<br/>Her job done, Nabiki left for her own classroom. Tsugako was<br/>waiting for her. She'd been acting as lookout. The taller girl<br/>with the long, curly hair and small eyes asked, "Did everything<br/>work out as you planned it?"<p>Nabiki said, "So far. The party will provide the witnesses, and<br/>it won't cost our concern anything. I've explained things to my<br/>big sister. She understands as long as Ranma Saotome is known by<br/>everybody to be a girl, the two fathers can't marry either of us off<br/>to Ranma."<p>Tsugako nodded, that much she understood, "You have legal proof<br/>that Ranma's father was FORCING Ranma to be a guy. As long as<br/>Ranma is a girl, the only one in your family she can marry is your<br/>brother, Kaneda. But what I don't understand is-"<p>Nabiki glanced sideways at her associate, "What our cousin Kei<br/>Tendou has to do with this?" She put her eyes forward again.<br/>"Kasumi's only willing to help if there's a fair chance."<p>Tsugako asked, " "Fair chance"?"<p>Nabiki's mood was no longer so upbeat, "That's the problem with<br/>fair chances. There's a chance that after all your efforts to<br/>have the house odds you could still lose." She frowned, "You<br/>see, Kei Tendou CAN marry one of us."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Little Miss Hinako, still looking like an 8 or 9-year-old, had<br/>just returned from somewhere out of the school's compound. She<br/>had armfuls of junk food. But she said, "I didn't realize I<br/>would have to make decisions as the principal."<p>Kane-chan told her, "Well, it's still the first day. From the<br/>way things I understand things were run under the old<br/>principals, the staff tried to avoid asking them anything. I'm<br/>sure they'll do their best to do without you."<p>Miss Hinako smiled, "That's good. Then I can concentrate on<br/>what's important." Right then she was concentrating on finishing<br/>her tako taco.<p>Ranma-chan said, humoring the brat, "And that would be, stoppin'<br/>delinquents?"<p>Miss Hinako said, "No, silly. I told you I want to show<br/>everybody I can REFORM people. The purpose of any school should<br/>be to turn out MODEL citizens!" Model citizens apparently ate<br/>chewed on Pocky sticks while drinking the chocolate straight<br/>from the cup.<p>Ranma-chan grumbled, "I don't like the sound of that." But<br/>biting back her rebellion, she concentrated on why she was<br/>putting up with being a girl, "Now, if we build you your tree<br/>house, will you tell us how you to that trick of yours?" She<br/>pulled out a paper napkin from the kid's load.<p>Miss Hinako asked, "The "Happo 5-yen Satsu"?"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Yes! That 5-yen statsu thing!" The kid looked<br/>like she was waiting for Ranma-chan to use the napkin for her.<br/>Since her arms were still full, Ranma did.<p>Miss Hinako smiled, and said, "Okay!"<p>Kane-chan said, "But we're going to build an PRINCIPAL'S office,<br/>right?"<p>Miss Hinako said to herself, "That's right, I have to have an<br/>office like any other high school administrator."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "In the TREES!" gesturing.<p>Miss Hinako told her quite definitely, "Oh, yes! It has to be<br/>here! It can't be ANY place else!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Back in Classroom 1-F the 45-minute lunchtime was over with. It<br/>was now well into the 30-minute cleaning time. Furinkan's<br/>schedule was a lot like any elementary school in Japan. It was<br/>at this part in the day the teenagers disliked the comparison.<br/>And the fact that their homeroom teacher/tannin was there,<br/>making sure everybody was doing something. At least Mr. Egami<br/>let them talk among themselves as they did mostly busy-work.<br/>They weren't expected to be full of "I'll do my best!" spirit.<p>Daisuke said, "Why isn't Kaneda here to help?" He was stacking<br/>desks.<p>Sayuri said, "Why isn't RANMA here to help?" She was pushing<br/>loose things with her broom.<p>Yuka was dusting with a rag, "I don't mind cleaning. It gives<br/>your mind a chance to rest!" Of course, she was dusting near<br/>where Hiroshi was cleaning erasers.<p>Hiroshi said, "Maybe we shouldn't GO to Ranma's birthday party."<p>Yuka said, "Not go to a girl's "Sweet Sixteen" party! Oh, we<br/>can't do that!"<p>Sayuri said, "That's right! From what Nabiki told us, Ranma<br/>hasn't had hardly ANY parties!"<p>Yuka said, "It breaks my heart to think of that poor girl's<br/>never had a birthday party before!"<p>Daisuke said, "WHY is she having one, anyway! Nabiki says<br/>Ranma's birthday has already gone: She was born April 1st!"<p>Hiroshi told him, "That IS the point, stupid! She wasn't HERE<br/>when she had her birthday. She didn't have ANYBODY but her cruel<br/>and heartless dad with her on her birthday."<p>Daisuke stopped stacking. "I THOUGHT you were on my side. I<br/>thought you didn't want to go any more than I do."<p>Hiroshi did his best to sound sincere, "Well, Yuka's convinced<br/>me we should go."<p>Daisuke did little to hide what he thought. He said to the guy<br/>allowing himself to be lead around on a leash, "Well, *I* don't<br/>want to go to a girl's birthday party!"<p>Hiroshi told his dense friend, "But it IS a gir-ls party! As in<br/>there'll be GIRLS there?"<p>Daisuke looked around the classroom; "Are there going to be any<br/>girls from outside this class?"<p>Sayuri bumped her broom against Daisuke's shoes, getting him to<br/>move, "Only girls who don't KNOW you would go out with you!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The frame of the tree house 2.5 meters off the ground was<br/>complete already. Kane-chan had hammered in the spikes through<br/>the beams and posts on the ground, and Ranma-chan pounded them<br/>in place using JUST a piece of scrap wood and the sides of her<br/>fist! The two of them were getting sweaty and where not at ALL<br/>concerned about their unladylike positions. (Indeed, besides<br/>trying to keep their boobs from moving around too much, Kane-<br/>chan kept pulling on her bra and panties, and Ranma-chan wished<br/>she could do something about her shiatsu corset.)<p>Eating shrimp-flavored crackers, Miss Hinako was having second<br/>thoughts, "Perhaps I should hire MEN."<p>Up in the tree Ranma-chan cried, "You want MEN? We can give you<br/>men!" She was straddling the beam that she'd just spiked into<br/>the one coming up at an angle from below. (And straddling<br/>reminded her what she as a girl had under her, between her<br/>legs.)<p>Kane-chan had just hammered in the last support brace to the<br/>tree's trunk; "You have something against women doing a "man's<br/>job"!" She DIDN'T want to give Ranma-chan the excuse to become<br/>a guy. (Though her OWN feelings argued that she should become a<br/>guy herself.)<p>Miss Hinako asked innocently, "Aren't most carpentry work done<br/>by men because they're better at it? They ARE stronger."<p>Kane-chan told her, "But women have greater manual dexterity,<br/>and physical endurance, and-"<p>Ranma-chan added, "And they can't stand being outdoors in the<br/>cold as much; they don't have the emotional endurance..."<p>Kane-chan did her best to ignore the person who still had a<br/>thing against having to be a girl, "Miss Hinako, the male<br/>teachers in Japan GREATLY outnumber the female teachers. Does<br/>that mean they're better at being teachers?" Again she repeated<br/>arguments she'd heard before from others.<p>Miss Hinako stood up straight and proud, "Of course not! If<br/>anything, women SHOULD be favored when it comes to working with<br/>children!"<p>Kane-chan said, "Well, close enough." She called up to Ranma-<br/>chan, "See! Being a woman shouldn't keep you from doing<br/>anything!"<p>Ranma-chan called back down, "YOU'RE one to talk!"<p>Kane-chan started tossing up boards as fast as she could, "Let's<br/>see some of that Saotome speed put into a little UPPER body<br/>action. Arrange these planks on the joices!"<p>Ranma-chan caught them, and was placing them faster than Kane-<br/>chan could give them up to her. But that didn't stop her from<br/>complaining, "What gives YOU the right to be the foreman!"<p>Kane-chan told her, "The Tendou School uses TOOLS, remember? I<br/>KNOW what I'm doing!"<p>Ranma-chan mocked her, "But YOUR name is "Saotome", remember!"<p>Kane-chan still smiled, "Which doesn't MEAN I haven't learned<br/>more from the Tendou School than the Saotome School!"<p>Miss Hinako watched them while she ate her caramel yam-on-a-<br/>stick, "Those two girls are acting like boys. They argue, but<br/>their battle auras aren't very heated. If it wasn't for the<br/>tremendous fighting spirit that wants to explode from Miss RANMA<br/>Saotome I'd say it was like they were only competitive rivals."<br/>Miss Hinako nodded, and dropped her half-eaten treat.<p>She took two large donuts from a box.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan had joined Ranma-chan. She had climbed up on the<br/>platform of loose planks that would become the tree office's<br/>floor. Both of them were kneeling near the center of the<br/>platform. She told Ranma-cha, "Watch what I do, and I'll show<br/>you "Tendou Martial Arts Carpentry"!"<p>Ranma-chan snorted, "Hhnnh! I'll just bet. It'd BETTER be out of<br/>the ordinary, if we're gonna get this dumb place done before-"<p>Kane-chan licked her fingertips, "Make sure your fingers are<br/>wet..."<p>Ranma-chan grumbled, "As if we don't get wet enough."<p>Kane-chan took a handful of nails, "The trick is to use Western-<br/>style nails, with flat heads. The larger the better." She put<br/>the nails in her mouth.<p>Ranma-chan said, "Well, That's ONE thing I like about it<br/>already: It makes it harder for you to talk."<p>Kane-chan leaned over in her school dress and blouse and stuck a<br/>thumb in her mouth. With the saliva keeping the nail in place,<br/>she brought it over where the floor joice was. She then shoved<br/>the nail down until it stuck in the wood, and stood up on its<br/>own. She repeated the process down the plank.<p>Ranma-chan had been kneeling in place, watching, though<br/>frowning, "Doesn't that hurt your fingers?"<p>Kane-chan challenged her, "How much of a martial artist are you?<br/>Of COURSE it hurts, but it's nothing compared to some pain we<br/>have to go through. Think of it as strengthening and toughening<br/>your fingers, hands and arms." Of course, applying a little<br/>"Tendou Upper-Body Whip-Crack" makes it a whole lot easier! But<br/>she's not going to appreciate MY school until she has to ask to<br/>learn its secrets.<p>Kane-chan then took a scrap board and set it on top of the nails<br/>sticking out of the floorboards. She used one of her wooden<br/>mallets to hammer the scrap dead center, then jumped out to the<br/>ends, then back closer to the center. In less than 30 seconds<br/>she had the scrap down level with the floorboards, all of the<br/>nails driven in straight.<p>Ranma-chan again snorted, "Hnh! With MY speed and strength, we<br/>should get this place done in almost no time."<p>Kane-chan told her, "Don't forget the manual dexterity. Without<br/>that the nails going in right, they'll be a hazard. Not to<br/>mention the room will be rickety!" The Ranma had already made<br/>the posts a little out of plumb.<p>Ranma-chan said, "Yeah, yeah!" as she dropped a handful of nails<br/>into her mouth.<p>Kane-chan crossed her arms, and kneeled back to watch. Ranma-<br/>chan tried to get as many nails sticking to as many fingers of<br/>one hand as she could. She would get two, three at most over to<br/>where they were supposed to be. The rest of the nails would drop<br/>off along the way. The nails were not evenly or efficiently<br/>spaced. But Kane-chan held back her comments. Ranma was<br/>stubborn. She would have to find out these things for herself.<br/>Kane-chan thought, Until Ranma DOES think of it as a<br/>martial arts event, she won't take it seriously. She's been<br/>brainwashed to think only something to do with fighting is<br/>worth her attention.<p>Ranma-chan got a raggedy line of nails over the floor joice on<br/>her side of the platform. Spitting out the last of the nails in<br/>her mouth, Ranma-chan shook her hand, "Oow! That DOES hurt! How<br/>many more times are we gonna have to do this?"<p>Kane-chan was ready to speak to her, "That's where a woman's<br/>endurance comes in. They can put up with pain better than men."<p>Ranma-chan couldn't take her seriously at all, "If you want to<br/>be an advocate for Women's Lib, then WHY don't you stay a girl!"<br/>She picked up her own scrap board to pound on.<p>Kane-chan said, "Because this is Japan! You can't kick, scream<br/>and claw your way up the ladder! It's hard enough for MEN to be<br/>accepted doing jobs they aren't certified or born to do."<p>Ranma-chan said, "And you want ME to put up with that, when you<br/>can't! Ayiiya!" Instead of using a hammer, Ranma-chan used<br/>both fists and forearms to pound the scrap board down onto the<br/>nails all at once.<p>Kane-chan glowered at the girl; even doing something she hadn't<br/>done before, but Kane-chan HAD, Ranma-chan had still found a way<br/>to be better! "I thought you just MIGHT be tougher than I am!"<p>Ranma-chan lifted the scrap board and looked at her sloppy line<br/>of nails; they were flush with the floor, though. Any part of<br/>the nail or head that wanted to stick out had been pressed into<br/>the planks. "That kind of tough life I DON'T want."<p>On her side, Kane-chan carefully slid to the floor planks that<br/>were still loose. She told her, "Think of all the women you<br/>could help who are not as strong and determined as you! You'd<br/>show the men and inspire the women!"<p>Ranma was about to put the nails in her mouth, "Right: A girl<br/>who thinks like a guy! It's gotta be their own fault they're OWN<br/>fault they allowed themselves to be on the bottom!" She started<br/>spitting out nails.<p>Kane-chan nearly choked on her own mouthful of nails. Rather<br/>than help Ranma take up the challenge of being a girl, what<br/>Ranma had said only reinforced her OWN determination not to be a<br/>girl. Win Ranma-chan or lose her, being a guy had GOT to be<br/>better than being a girl. A wife was expected to be a HELPMATE;<br/>a mother was expected to be care for the kids: But WHAT kind of<br/>help and care did THEY get!<p>Then, again, the female principle, Yin, WAS dark and negative!<p>She put her anger to proving just how much of a guy she was: The<br/>TENDOU School would be the winner at Martial Arts Carpentry!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan had put away her wooden mallet. She had learned to do<br/>Ranma's trick with the two fists and forearms. And she'd almost<br/>become as good at driving the nails into the planks. But she<br/>wasn't as strong as Ranma-chan! She had to go back and finish<br/>getting the nails flush with the mallet against the scrap board.<p>And she was losing the race, too! They had moved beyond the<br/>floorboards and were moving the planks up the posts. The walls<br/>were rising fast, and Ranma's faster than HERS!<p>An adult, and sexy, woman's voice called up to them from the<br/>ground, "Oh, girls! Don't go any higher with the walls! I want<br/>to be surrounded by windows!" Ranma-chan was still putting up<br/>boards and driving nails in behind Kane-chan.<p>Kane-chan looked over the railing high wallboards. "Miss<br/>Hinako! Is that you?" It certainly looked like the busty<br/>woman that had sent Kaneda swooning (and from this angle above<br/>her, Kane-chan had a VERY good view of her cleavage). ...Could a<br/>woman with THAT fantastic a figure possibly eat many donuts?<p>Well, maybe not. Miss Hinako wasn't eating the donuts. She was<br/>casually holding a donut in each hand, with the holes up. If<br/>Kane-chan had been aware of how her powers work, she would have<br/>noticed that the holes were aimed at Ranma-chan. Miss Hinako<br/>wasn't interested in draining energy, just siphoning the excess<br/>off. And Ranma's anger over what had happened to her, made into<br/>rage by what NABIKI Tendou's character assassination this<br/>morning gave the battle aura eater more than enough to sustain<br/>her adult form. It also had relieved a great deal of all that<br/>pressure building up inside Ranma. And that had allowed Ranma-<br/>chan to put her energy to CONSTRUCTIVE, if sloppy, use.<p>The woman called back to Kane-chan, "Yes, it's me: Miss Hinako!<br/>Did you hear me? I said my office must have plenty of windows!"<p>Kane-chan glanced away from the beautiful woman long enough to<br/>remind her what she already knew: There was hardly any view at<br/>all. On all sides of her office in the tree there were trees<br/>that blocked her views of the main building and the playing<br/>fields. Kane-chan brought eyes back on the attractive woman, "I<br/>didn't order any windows. If the walls stay this low, it'll look<br/>like you're in a forest ranger's tower."<p>The sexy woman said, amused, "That's alright. I'm HERE to put<br/>out the fires."<p>Kane-chan wondered how much of a damper she WOULD be putting on<br/>the school's teenage hormones. Well, KANEDA wouldn't mind her<br/>being a wet blanket. And Kaneda wouldn't mind her being a wet<br/>blanket on Ranma, either, wet as in curse, that is.<p>Kane-chan turned around, "Ranma! Did you hear what Miss..."<br/>Ranma-chan had already covered her side of the office wall in<br/>planks and was already working on the ceiling. And she, being<br/>Ranma, had to do things differently from ordinary people:<p>Leaning a plank end against the wall, Ranma-chan was pushing the<br/>nails in with her knuckles now. She then took the plank and<br/>jumped up to the ceiling beam. There she slammed her scrap board<br/>against the nails sticking out of the plank, driving it into the<br/>beam. The floorboards bent and wiggled as she landed, but this<br/>proved that the floor was sturdy enough to support even this.<p>Miss Hinako, especially, had to wonder at the energy the Ranma<br/>girl had! That intensity of energy left her with no doubt that<br/>the time would come, and come soon, when she would have to<br/>discipline Ranma Saotome. Miss Hinako knew that she could not go<br/>easy on the girl with a man's fighting spirit. Indeed, "Ranma<br/>Saotome may just be the biggest challenge I've ever faced."<p>Meanwhile, Kane-chan was still staring at how Ranma's boobs<br/>bounced and wobbled and jiggled this way and that way. If she<br/>had been a guy she probably would've kept her mouth shut and<br/>enjoyed the show. But, being a girl, she was reminded of what it<br/>was like to have boobs (and other fat deposits that moved over<br/>the body). "Aren't you getting terribly bruised? It can't be fun<br/>having them flip-flop around like that."<p>Ranma-chan bellowed, "TELL me about it!" pouncing straight at<br/>her.<p>Kane-chan bailed: She dove out the open "window" beside her.<p>Kane-chan was more concerned about hugging her arms against her<br/>own boobs, than the show of her polka dot panties. She landed on<br/>her slippers near Miss Hinako.<p>Ranma-chan gripped plank at the opening in the wall, and<br/>threatened, "I'll finish the rest WITHOUT your comments!"<p>As Ranma-chan went back to work on her own, Kane-chan vowed to<br/>come back and fix things while Ranma wasn't around. And I have<br/>the satisfaction of having already slipped in a few of my booby<br/>traps. It looks like Ranma doesn't know enough about carpentry<br/>to know she'd help build them for me. They SHOULD come in<br/>handy.<p>Miss Hinako said, "Miss Akane, come with me. I want to show you<br/>what needs to be done, now."<p>Kane-chan nodded, "Yes, Ma'am." She would've felt stupid saying<br/>the to a little kid, but it came out naturally with this woman.<p>Miss Hinako stopped in front of one of the trees that would<br/>block her view of things. She took out a piece of chalk. She<br/>lowered and raised her other hand until it was above her navel.<br/>She brought that hand over to the tree trunk and marked the same<br/>height. "There! That ought to be about heart level."<p>Kane-chan thought, "Heart level"? Yeah, for a kid -That's it!<br/>It IS for when she's a kid!<p>Miss Hinako then pointed to a spot at her adult heart's level.<br/>She then made an estimate higher up, from the tree house over to<br/>the same tree. "And one about that height!" She then turned her<br/>eyes onto Kane-chan, "I want holes put in this tree." She<br/>gestured around her, "I want holes put in ALL of these trees!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>`<br/>As luck would have it, Dr. Tofu Ono had had to deal with an<br/>emergency. The patients he saw the most often were of course<br/>elderly. Mrs. Baba was not one of them. She was the terror of<br/>the neighborhood, a living caricature of a bitter, mean old<br/>woman. And for somebody who claimed they were half-crippled, she<br/>was as effective as any martial artist with her cane.<p>That had been what had delayed him on his trip to the temple.<br/>This had been her worst rampage yet. No one had been hurt<br/>seriously, at least. Almost all of the injuries in fact had come<br/>when people scrambled to get out of her way. They had had to<br/>wait until he dealt with Mrs. Baba. She had fought like she was<br/>possessed by a demon.<p>That was because she was. It had taken him several retreats<br/>and tries before the doctor found the correct shiatsu points that<br/>sealed the demon inside.<p>As Dr. Tofu lifted the limp woman in his arms he was addressed<br/>by another old man, "Perhaps I have a ward that will release the<br/>demon from the woman."<p>It was Mr. Priestess Ryoushin of the Temple of the Nine<br/>Abilities. "I will tell you that it HAS been a while since I did<br/>any exorcising. We tend to stay within the Temple." He laughed<br/>to himself, "That's where we can best exercise our talents."<p>The doctor heard about the old man; he respectfully refrained<br/>from indulging him, "I understand. You prime duty is to guard<br/>the Temple and its contents." But the aura the demon emitted<br/>probably attracted him on one of his excursions outside.<p>The old man approached with handful of paper wards. "What kind<br/>of a demon do you think it is?"<p>Dr. Ono found a bench to lay Mrs. Baba down on. It was beneath a<br/>large mirror on a pole. It's polished surface allowed people to<br/>see what was coming around the corner in the road. The doctor<br/>told the priest, "I would say the demon feeds off of her<br/>resentment." He straightened up, "At lest that's what I used to<br/>seal it in."<p>The old man shook his head sadly, "Yes, I see it, now. Such a<br/>negative emotion to mar such a cute face."<p>Dr. Tofu was one to not judge by appearances, but this old man<br/>acted like he actually could see the twisted old woman's beauty.<br/>"Uh, the story is when she was a young woman, she had to choose<br/>between a career and marriage."<p>The old priest shook his head, "An all too common story. But the<br/>stories *I* hear end with the woman finding happiness in giving<br/>it all up for the sake of a family." He placed one of the pieces<br/>of paper with the written prayer on Mrs. Baba's forehead.<p>Dr. Tofu filled him in on what the neighborhood knew of her,<br/>"Even though her husband loved her, he did not understand her.<br/>He continued to treat her the way he had before their arranged<br/>marriage. Worse, her nagging and fighting only drove him to his<br/>old girlfriends. Her battles with them didn't end, either."<p>The old priest held up his gohei stick with the pieces of paper<br/>on strings. "Yes, men are idiots." He laughed, "I know: I used<br/>to be like that myself! I was a champion girl hunter before my<br/>dear Hani-chan put me under the goddess Benten's spell." He<br/>chanted and waved his exorcism wand.<p>Dr. Tofu was about to say something when he noticed red wisp<br/>surrounded by a dark blue aura leave the woman's open mouth. The<br/>sleeping woman visibly relaxed.<p>The old man squatted, "Oh, that wears an old man out. I need to<br/>rest a moment."<p>Dr. Tofu continued to look at the woman. "The demon is gone, but<br/>the feelings remain."<p>The old priest glanced at her, "She should have been more of a<br/>Buddhist." He looked away, "She should have been more of a<br/>woman."<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Surely you don't suggest it is the woman who<br/>must make all of the sacrifices?"<p>Groaning a bit, the old man rose, "No, but isn't that how it<br/>usually works out? A woman's brain is build differently. They<br/>have better "people skills"." He smiled, "And I don't mean the<br/>kind that makes men political leaders."<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Is that why you put the shiatsu corset on<br/>Ranma? So that Ranma would stay a woman long enough to<br/>use her brain?"<p>The old priest said, "I hope you didn't take it off?"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "I did, until I heard who had done it. I then put<br/>it back until I heard from you why you did it to the poor kid."<p>The priest smiled, "Karma!"<p>Dr. Tofu was not amused, "Karma is a Buddhist concept."<p>The old man's smile broadened, "You know we Japanese can be both<br/>a Shintoist and a Buddhist." He chuckled, "I even know the<br/>rituals to the Christian sacraments. (Of course I do it for a<br/>different reason than their priests.)" He started to do a small<br/>jig, "But my specialty is love. I'm in love with the idea of<br/>love!"<p>Dr. Tofu paled, "You mean Ranma and, and Kasumi?" He bowed his<br/>head. "If that is what will make her the happiest. -Ow!"<p>The old man had shot a pebble out of his bamboo blowgun; it had<br/>struck him between the eyes. "As I said, men can be idiots.<p>"It is better to have loved and lost, than to have loved and won<br/>the booby prize! Karma has given Ranma and KANEDA a chance few<br/>others have. They can come to see both sexes AS both sexes. Once<br/>they accept that, they can learn to accept the other sex. Unlike the<br/>rest of us, they will be able to agree which sex they will be<br/>for the other. And appreciating that can make all the<br/>difference."<p>Dr. Tofu said, "But Ranma resents and is repulsed by what's<br/>being forced on him!"<p>The old man said, "Trauma and stress will do that. It will take<br/>time. Kaneda HAS had a head start of 16 years to get used to the<br/>idea he could become a girl. It has only been weeks for Ranma.<br/>It WOULD be easier if he had to stay a girl. But it would not be<br/>fair."<p>He turned a serious eye on the doctor, "And without it being HIS<br/>choice, his soul would never be fully accept it. Deep down, he<br/>would always resent his fate."<p>The doctor nodded, "Yes. I see that, now. Kaneda has been raised<br/>to think like a guy. He, too, would resent having to become the<br/>girl without agreeing to it. She definitely would want Ranma to<br/>appreciate what she'd done for him."<p>The old priest nodded, "Only then could she be satisfied being the<br/>wife and mother."<p>Dr. Tofu still had his doubts, "But there will ALWAYS be that<br/>accusation in the back of their minds. They will know that they<br/>had to give up the gender the other enjoyed."<p>The old priest said, "A true man and a true woman knows that is<br/>what they were meant to be. I will provide you with a technique<br/>that seals away the small doubts they have left. But the<br/>knowledge of what they learned will make them a better man and a<br/>better woman." He grinned, "In fact, the more they fight now,<br/>the less they'll fight then. Because they will definitely<br/>establish WHAT kind the man or woman would best please each<br/>other."<p>The End of this chapter<p>Submit ReviewReport Possible AbuseAdd Story to FavoritesAdd Author to<br/>FavoritesAdd Author to Author Alert 1.
