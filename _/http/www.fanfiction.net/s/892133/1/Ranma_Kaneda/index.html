</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>unauthorized, but allowed.<p>{} indicate thoughts.<p>[I based the layout of the Tendou house on floorplans I<br/>found on the web. One is "The Tendo Dojo", of "Jinma<br/>Saotome's MKR Anime World".<p>[The only complete statistics I found was at "The<br/>Ultimate Nabiki Tendo Site". Using her a the guide, I<br/>readjusted up by 2 inches "Doug's Ranma ½ Resources.<br/>Everything else is my best guess based on Nabiki; they<br/>are not to be read as exact.]<p>(Note: The holes have been left on purpose they'll be<br/>filled in later.)<p>01: And There's Kaneda!<p>Nineteen years earlier, one of the apprentices to a thief<br/>had been looking through his master's treasures. He came<br/>on some ancient writing. Hoping to learn some martial<br/>arts secrets, he read. It was story about a magic spring<br/>in Japan that turned foxes into young men.<p>A thought struck him. If a freshly delivered newborn were<br/>cleaned with water from that spring before the mother<br/>knew of its original sex...<p>It was too bad Soun Tendou never had the chance to finish<br/>reading the text.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>A handsome, middle-aged man with long black hair and a<br/>moustache, and wearing a gray brown, black belt do-<br/>gi/training uniform sat at his Japanese-style table. His<br/>back was to the open fusuma/sliding paper-and-wood doors<br/>that framed his garden. He read a postcard, and wept, "At<br/>last! At long last! Ranma is coming!"<p>His tears flowing even more freely now, he turned over to<br/>glance at the picture of the panda on the other side,<br/>thinking for a moment it might be mean something. "And<br/>soon, VERY soon, Ranma will be here!"<p>He lifted his head in his family room. "Listen up!<br/>Kasumi! Nabiki! Kaneda!"<p>He went down the hall to the kitchen. Pushing aside the<br/>door flounce. "Kasumi?"<p>The tall young woman in her pink house slippers was<br/>modestly but tastefully dressed in a pink midi, light<br/>yellow long sleeved blouse, and a white apron that<br/>matched the ribbon bow at her shoulder that her long<br/>brown hair was tied in. She paused in her meal<br/>preparation to answer, "What is it Father?"<p>The man opened a door, "Nabiki."<p>The teenager, her shiny brown hair in a long bob, was in<br/>white cutoff shorts with yellow lining, an oversized<br/>tucked-in, green t-shirt and a pink tank top under it.<br/>She looked up from the magazine she was reading while<br/>stretched down on the bed. "Hmm?"<p>The man opened another bedroom door, "Kaneda!" He was a<br/>little frustrated to find the room empty. "Where is that<br/>boy?"<p>Soun Tendou shrugged. "Well, it doesn't really concern<br/>him. Ranma can't be Kaneda's fiancee..."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda came home from his jog about the town. The 179<br/>cm/5'10", 69 kg/153# teenager had long loose hair like<br/>his father. But HIS was red. He went straight to the area<br/>of white sand in front of the "Tendou School of Anything-<br/>Goes Martial Arts" dojo. There he shucked the running<br/>shoes, blue shorts, green tank and short white towel and<br/>got into his yellow do-gi with the red belt.<p>Ready to take out his remaining frustrations, he got into<br/>position before the cinderblocks on cinderblocks he'd set<br/>out on the arena outside the dojo earlier.<p>"HA-YIIYA!" He broke them with one blow.<p>He smiled, and straightened up. Wiping the brow over his<br/>blue eyes, he said, "Hoo-wa! That felt okay!"<p>Flash! Went the camera his sister was holding. And she<br/>had another beefcake picture for anybody who'd buy them.<p>"There you go again, Kaneda," said Nabiki entering the<br/>arena in front of the dojo. "Can't you do normal things,<br/>like date girls?"<p>Kaneda's temper returned, "No! I'm not going to let you<br/>set me up on a date, Nabiki! Not every guy's world<br/>revolves around...Girls!"<p>Nabiki gave her cynical look, "Then why do you hang out<br/>with Hiroshi and Daisuke?"<p>It was obvious that got to him. It was too easy. Nabiki<br/>decided not to push it any further. It was enough that he<br/>was reminded that she knew. "Daddy has called a family<br/>meeting in the living room. He says it'll change the life<br/>of at least one of us."<p>Kaneda's glum frown remained. "I bet it won't change<br/>mine."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The cherry blossoms fell outside the open sliding doors<br/>to the garden. Soun Tendou addressed his children sitting<br/>on the other side of the repositioned table. Nabiki had<br/>changed into an aqua-and-purple, floral kimono, while all<br/>Kasumi had to do was take off her apron to be<br/>presentable. Kaneda, on the other hand, was still wearing<br/>his sweaty do-gi.<p>Kasumi wondered, "Fiance?"<p>"Yes. The son of a very good friend of mine. His name is<br/>Ranma Saotome.<p>"His father and I trained together. We made a pledge to<br/>see the two families joined. You could say you have been<br/>betrothed since birth."<p>Kaneda relaxed. This had nothing to do with him. He<br/>leaned back on his hands on the mats. Glancing his blue<br/>eyes at Nabiki, he smiled. It was HIS turn, "You're<br/>trying to look out for you daughters. I am the son, and<br/>tradition says that's who should carry on with the school<br/>and dojo. You're lucky you had me, Dad. Thanks to<br/>me, the Tendou Family Legacy is secure."<p>Nabiki reminded little brother, "IF you can find the<br/>money to pay the inheritance tax." Again, she got a<br/>reaction from him.<p>Soun Tendou was not comfortable with that line of<br/>conversation. He refused to remember why. Looking down at<br/>the postcard in his hand was the distraction he needed,<br/>"He'll be here any minute."<p>He got up from the table. "Ranma and his father have been<br/>on a training mission." He turned to look at his garden,<br/>another, another excuse not to have to look at them.<p>The tall man rose up. "Recently they crossed into China!"<p>"Ooo, China!" Nabiki gushed. She was definitely going to<br/>have to date. She sounded like a giddy middle schoolgirl.<p>Kaneda was still taking it all casually, "So he hiked all<br/>the way to China: Wow. Big deal." {Dad never took me on a<br/>training mission. He's hardly trained me at all, in<br/>fact.}<p>Kasumi asked, "Father, how old is this, Ranma?" She still<br/>had not blinked since hearing about a fiance.<p>Nabiki asked, "Is he cute?" The problem was, she<br/>sincerely wanted to know.<p>Kasumi said, "Younger men bore me," raising her own<br/>criterion.<p>Kaneda asked, "What kind of guy is he?" {Is he going to<br/>be a jerk that was going to give the family trouble?}<p>"Ha, ha," Mr. Tendou gave a false laugh. "I don't know,"<br/>he said, looking over his shoulder, unable to move the<br/>rest of his body.<p>Nabiki turned her look on her 'Daddy', "You don't know?"<p>The man went back to not facing them. "I've never met<br/>him."<p>Kasumi said nothing: She stared at her father.<p>Nabiki said nothing: She stared at her parental unit.<p>Kaneda wondered again about just what he'd inherited from<br/>this man.<p>A cold silence filled the spring-lit room.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>They head a familiar sound echoing from the foyer.<p>Kasumi said, "It sounds like the front door," almost<br/>getting up.<p>Nabiki had no problem jumping up. "Ooo. Ranma!" she<br/>cried, running out of the family room to meet them as<br/>fast as her kimono would allow.<p>Kaneda looked at how silly she was acting. "Boy, am I<br/>glad I'm not a girl."<p>But his dad was already following her lead, "Saotome. My<br/>friend, we've been waiting!" {That's Dad!} he sighed.<p>Kasumi had gotten up, so Kaneda had to, too. He followed<br/>her into the garden hall.<p>She said, "I hope he's older than me!"<p>Kanda shook his head again at the way girls thought. He<br/>could understand guys wanting younger girls. But why<br/>wouldn't girls want younger guys? Well, it helped the<br/>guys get their younger girls.<p>"Hhmm-mmm!" Nabiki's girly mood had completely vanished.<br/>She came running around the corner, and straight towards<br/>Kasumi and Kaneda. Their father followed, just as<br/>shocked.<p>Kaneda's martial arts training was sparked. {I'm dressed<br/>for it, this time!}<p>Next around the corner was a (very) short red haired boy<br/>in Chinese clothes being carried by a-<p>Kaneda's spark was extinguished. There was nothing in his<br/>training that prepared him for this. For here in his<br/>house was a very large panda walking on its hind legs!<p>Kasumi standing in the way stopped Nabiki's flight. Then<br/>her own martial arts training kicked in, and she made to<br/>protect her sister. Somewhat.<p>Seeing his children 'standing ground'(his son, though,<br/>the furthest back, and still), Soun Tendou was forced to<br/>turn and face the intruders. He nearly froze.<p>"Com' on, Pop! You're scarin' them spitless!" the young<br/>boy yelled at the beast.<p>The daughters were each holding onto one of their<br/>father's arms, half hiding behind him; Nabiki more so.<br/>Despite the wide open door to the outside, Soun felt<br/>trapped.<p>Kasumi said, "So, Father, this is your friend?" She used<br/>a quiet voice so as not to startle the wild animal.<p>"Hm, Hm, Hnn!" he shook his head hard enough to send his<br/>long hair whipping back and forth.<p>Nabiki glared at a father who couldn't take his off the<br/>beast, "Oh, so this panda just decided to drop in, is<br/>that it, hunh?"<p>"Hm, Hm, Hnn!" His head swished his hair again. Nabiki<br/>found she couldn't bring herself to look AWAY from her<br/>one parental figure. If faith didn't spur him to act like<br/>a man, at least she had Kaneda. Maybe: But why wasn't he<br/>doing anything, either!<p>The monstrous black-and-white form took the small boy off<br/>its shoulder and set him down before the family.<p>The animal didn't attack, not even the boy. Kaneda got<br/>his equilibrium back. {It's always better to know what<br/>you're fighting, first.} His senses now wanted to pay<br/>more attention on the blue-eyed boy. {And he's got red<br/>hair, just like me, too.}<p>Soun Tendou held up a shaking finger, pointing it towards<br/>him. "You wouldn't be..."<p>There was something about that boy that disturbed Kaneda.<br/>{But it didn't feel like a threat.} He moved as close to<br/>him as he could. Nabiki was in the way, but he was tall.<p>The boy noticed Kaneda stare among all the other stares.<br/>He turned his blue eyes away from them. "I'm Ranma<br/>Saotome. Sorry about this."<p>Mr. Tendou said, "At last, you're here!" trying to<br/>recover his dignity, but forgetting the next line of his<br/>greeting.<p>Kaneda noted there was something wrong (or right) about<br/>Ranma's face. {Why do I be interested in a kid's body?}<p>Nabiki was also trying to recover her self-possession.<br/>"Ooo. He is cute."<p>The man of the house proved his strength by taking Ranma<br/>into a great bear hug. "I'm so glad you're here!" he<br/>assured everybody, pressing the boy to his chest...and<br/>stomach.<p>Kaneda became instantly jealous of his dad for some<br/>reason. {If I'd been more of a man that could've been<br/>me.}<p>Soun's eye nearly bugged, "Hmm!"<p>He pressed the boy to his stomach this time. Again. A<br/>third time. But a boy shouldn't have them.<p>Now it wasn't just the clues his stomach felt. Under that<br/>wet silk shirt, he was sure he felt...<p>He took his hands off of Ranma's back, and brought them<br/>to the skin exposed by the short sleeves.<p>He still tried denying that feeling. A feeling that<br/>caused him to break out in an instant sweat. He was<br/>fighting feelings he hadn't had for-<p>He pushed Ranma way by the shoulders. "Huh! Uh!" He<br/>choked on the words.<p>Nabiki's saw his reaction. She got the idea, and turned<br/>to Ranma. She squatted down to be at eye level with,<br/>"Hmm..." She poked Ranma's chest, then rubbed it.<p>Now Kaneda was jealous of his sister! {There's one<br/>advantage to being a girl.}<p>They were unpleasant feelings for Ranma, "Uh, hmm: Could<br/>you stop that."<p>The words were wrong, but there was something about the<br/>way Ranma said that that Kaneda liked. {What a wonderful<br/>voice ...for a-}<p>Nabiki turned to announce, "Ranma's not a boy: He's a<br/>girl!"<p>Soun repeatd, "Uh, girl!" He fainted.<p>Kaneda was on his butt.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Soun woke up in his futon, pillow and blanket in the<br/>family room.<p>He heard Kasumi say, "Oh, poor father; he must be so<br/>disappointed."<p>Nabiki's frustrations spilled out, "HE'S Disappointed!<br/>He's not the only one! Look at HER! Some fiancee..." Soun<br/>had been out long enough for Nabiki to change back into<br/>the two shirts and the cutoff shorts.<p>Kaneda said, "Stop it you two. She is our guest!"<p>Nabiki said, "I can see YOU'RE not disappointed." Kaneda<br/>hadn't realized how desperate Nabiki was. So much for the<br/>ice queen.<p>Kasumi noted, "Look everyone. Father's coming to."<p>Nabiki leaned over him, "This is all your fault, Daddy.<br/>Don't you know the difference between a boy and a girl?"<p>Kaneda thought, (I didn't see it at first either. Is that<br/>normal, or something else that only happens to Tendou<br/>guys?)<p>Soun answered, "I assumed my friend Genma's son was a<br/>boy."<p>Nabiki reached over and squeezed one of Ranma's boobs,<br/>"Excuse me, does this look like a boy to you, hunh,<br/>Daddy!"<p>Kaneda wondered, {Could I ever come up with an excuse to<br/>do that?}<p>This was worse than the first time she'd handled her<br/>breasts. Ranma, trying to be a guest told her, frowning,<br/>"Please. I wish you'd stop that!"<p>Kaneda spoke up, "Yeah, Nabiki! Leave Ranma alone! You<br/>want her to think you're a homo."<p>Nabiki took her hand away. Embarrassed now, she struck<br/>back, "Me! What about YOU?"<p>This was it. Showdown. "What ABOUT me?"<p>Their guest (and behind her the panda) was sitting<br/>between her and Kaneda. And Daddy was lying in front of<br/>her, with Kasumi at kneeling by his head. Nabiki said,<br/>"Nothing."<p>Kaneda wanted a new subject, "Are you a martial artist,<br/>too, Ranma?"<p>Ranma looked up at him with her big blue eyes and nodded,<br/>"Umh, hmm."<p>Kaneda asked, "We have our own dojo. Do you want to spar?<br/>I promise to go easy on you."<p>Ranma began to get some fire in her, "Why would you have<br/>to go easy on me?"<p>Kaneda said, chivalrously, "You ARE a girl."<p>The other redhead leaped to her bare feet, "I'll show you<br/>how much of a 'girl' I am. I'LL be the one goin' easy on<br/>you." There was something about this guy that was rubbing<br/>her the wrong way. That wasn't like her. She didn't like<br/>feelings. She didn't know how to handle them. She tried<br/>to put on a personable front, but not get involved in<br/>their emotions. That's how she'd endured the looks she'd<br/>been getting.<p>So what was it about this guy that was pushing her<br/>buttons!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The much taller Kaneda showed the pigtailed girl {She has<br/>to be a C cup} to the dojo. {It's more authentic than<br/>most I've seen.} "You studied Kempo?"<p>Ranma entered. "A little."<p>Kaneda said, "Well, why don't we have a little match,<br/>then."<p>Ranma smirked. "Okay, then. A 'little match' it'll be."<p>Kaneda set himself in his bare feet and got into the<br/>position. Ranma just stood there with her hands behind<br/>her back. "You said you knew how to fight?"<p>Ranma said, confidently, "Go ahead. Give it your best<br/>shot."<p>Kaneda told himself, {Easy, now. Getting mad wouldn't be<br/>the smoothest move. You don't win girls that way.} He<br/>said, "Don't worry. I won't hurt you."<p>He threw his fist, index and middle joints out.<p>The girl jumped over it! He had wanted to impress her by<br/>how close he could come without touching her as a See-<br/>you-can-trust-me tactic!<p>He threw up a flat foot kick. "Yea!" The girl leaned her<br/>body to the side... "Yea!" Again, not even close ..."Yea!" a<br/>blow; a lean to the other side..."Yea!" a blow to the<br/>right; another simple lean away..." Yea!" an instep kick<br/>straight up the middle; she leaned backwards! Motions he<br/>made raised his long red hair.<p>And still she was smirking! {And here I thought there<br/>might be ONE girl I could reach out for.}<p>"What's wrong! Attack me!" Combination blows: Right<br/>fist, "Hy-Aagh!" Left fist, "Aaarh!" Left fist, "Yearh!"<p>Panting hard, and hot from more than just the exertion,<br/>he thought, {Why, why am I missing her! Is she reading<br/>my moves!}<p>"Okay, this time for real!" and he charged. "Aarrgh-<br/>Yeeaaa!"<p>POW!<p>The girl decked him. Kaneda whacked his head hard on the<br/>floor.<p>Ranma stepped over the son of his host saying, "Maybe if<br/>you challenge me like a true martial artist, next time,<br/>I'll give you that sparing match."<p>The intent was not lost on Kaneda. A girl was better at<br/>his heritage than he was.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>His head hurt. Little did he suspect what could happen<br/>when somebody got their head banged by Ranma.<p>Sulking for long minutes as the pain eased, Kaneda<br/>finally got to his feet. He went through his katas. He<br/>couldn't get Ranma out of his mind. "That was only the<br/>first round."<p>He started rehearsing out loud, "It's not like I don't<br/>want to be a martial artist..." {No, that's no good.} "I do<br/>want to be martial artist. I have to be a martial artist!<br/>I owe it to... not just my dad." No, she doesn't seem to be<br/>the kind of girl who goes for melodramas.} "Ever since my<br/>mom died, Dad has been very emotional. And I mean<br/>emotional! Instead of normal outbursts, his are all wet."<br/>{Oh, that's it; admit how weird Dad can be.} "Look! It's<br/>not my fault! Dad owns a dojo, but he doesn't spend any<br/>time in it! I've learned the best I can." {Okay, so I<br/>don't practice as much as I could.} "I've even gotten<br/>help from a coach! But he's busy most of the time. If I<br/>had somebody who could stay around, and help me-"<p>A match had been struck: "That's it! With Ranma by my<br/>side, we CAN make the Tendou dojo a legacy worth owning!"<p>A fire had been lit in his belly. "I lost the bet, and I<br/>won! The life that's going to change is mine! Ranma is<br/>going to be MY fiancée!"<p>He headed out of the dojo, smiling. "And she's cute!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Walking into the house, Kaneda started having second<br/>thoughts. {She's cute, and dangerous!}<p>[In his head he heard Hiroshi say, 'Are you a martial<br/>artist or not?'<p>[And Daisuke say, 'Cowards don't get the girls!'<p>[Frowning, Kaneda 'told' them, you're ones to talk.]<p>But they were right. Ever since he was old enough to<br/>understand why there were guys and girls, he had been<br/>coward. That's why he hung out with Hiroshi Tsujitani and<br/>Daisuke Koyasu. Their interest in girls was like an<br/>inoculation shot for his reputation. Their {Ahem!} 'luck'<br/>with the girls meant he wasn't expected to actually date.<br/>Because they were losers, he was a loser.<p>{Loser!} The word had him close his hand into a fist.<br/>{Even if he loses, a martial artist much put a fight! A<br/>martial artist must earn respect. I must earn Ranma's<br/>respect. Only when she respects me can I hope to win her.<br/>A wife should respect her husband.} "Yes! This girl will<br/>be different," Kaneda said, untying the red belt of his<br/>do-gi coat as he entered the bathroom. "No matter how<br/>many times Ranma throws me, she will respect my<br/>dedication."<p>He tossed the sweaty coat, and then the pants into the<br/>laundry basket. He didn't see the Chinese clothes already<br/>in it. "Then when she respects me, she'll have to look at<br/>me differently. She'll get to know what I'm really like.<br/>I'm likable."<p>Without a stitch on, he went to the sliding door between<br/>the laundry room and the bathroom. "And if she doesn't?<br/>We're already betrothed. I'm never going to get a better<br/>shot at finding a girl who HAS to accept that I-"<p>A strange pigtailed {Pigtailed? But black haired} guy<br/>Kaneda's age was just stepping out of the tub.<p>Caught off guard, they stared at each other.<p>{That guy seems awfully interested in my dick. I don't<br/>know why. He looks like he's got a good sized one of his<br/>own. At least it's not hard. I can't help but think how<br/>STUPID it looks when I see that in the locker room.}<p>Kaneda said, "Er, hello." {Maybe I SHOULD turn around and<br/>leave.} "This is my house. I live here. I'm Kaneda."<br/>Kaneda agonized, {He might think I was strange if I did<br/>leave! Guys sharing the same tub isn't supposed to be a<br/>big deal in Japan.}<p>Finally the guy said something, "I, I was leavin'."<p>Kaneda almost visibly relaxed. "Okay." Kaneda nodded and<br/>walked as casually as he could towards the bath. He tried<br/>to ignore the guy who was about to pass him, who was<br/>doing the same for him. But he wondered, {Mine IS thicker<br/>than his?}<p>Testily, the gray-eyed guy told him, "I don't like guys<br/>checkin' me out at ANY time!" slapping a heavy wet hand<br/>on Kaneda's shoulder.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>In the family room, Soun Tendou was toasting a glass of<br/>beer with a broad man in Eastern-style/over-ears-loops<br/>glasses and a white do-gi with a black belt and a dew-rag<br/>on his head.<p>Suddenly two loud, shocked screams broke out of the<br/>bathroom and into the rest of the house.<p>The guest looked away from his drink and said, "That<br/>sounds like my son!"<p>Soun thought, and said, "I don't recognize the girl's<br/>voice."<p>The son cried, "I didn't know! I didn't know you were at<br/>Juusenkyyy-Ow! Stop hitting me! Hey! That hurts you<br/>know!"<p>The girl yelled, full of fury, "I won't let you tell<br/>anybody!"<p>The son cried, "Oh, no!" and ran for the exit.<p>The girl yelled, "Come back here, and take it like a<br/>guy!" and followed.<p>The black haired pigtailed boy ran buff naked out into the<br/>unfamiliar house. "I won't take it as a guy, either!"<p>A longhaired brunet girl ran totally nude after him.<br/>"Aaarr! Wait until I get my hands on you!"<p>Finding the middle hall, the son told his pursuer, "I'm<br/>not interested in that sort of thing!"<p>That got a roar from the girl as she sped down the garden<br/>hall, "Pervert! You know that's not what I said!"<p>The son came to the foyer: Outside! Naked!<br/>Upstairs! Trapped! He continued his trip through it.<br/>"Pervert! you were the one lookin' at ME!"<p>Rounding the foyer, the brown-eyed girl yelled, "It was<br/>okay when I did it!"<p>Kasumi asked from the other side of the kitchen door, "Is<br/>it safe to look?"<p>Leaning out of the kitchen door, Nabiki answered, "OH,<br/>my," as Ranma entered the middle hall. What a time to<br/>feel frustrated.<p>Kasumi asked, "Do we know the girl?"<p>Nabiki nodded, "I'm afraid we do."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The black hairedboy ran into the living room, and leaped<br/>over the low table Soun and his father were sitting at.<p>The two men spilled their drinks when they saw the nude<br/>young girl run in. The shorter black haired Japanese yelled at<br/>the boy, "Stop right there! Do you know what it's like to<br/>have to run with these things!" indicating her still<br/>bounce-and-bopping size B's.<p>The pigtail boy yelled back, "Yeah! I do! Not to mention<br/>feelin' everything ELSE that comes with the package!"<p>The strange man barked at his son, "Boy! This is not the<br/>time!"<p>Nabiki came into the room, "What do you think you're<br/>doing!"<p>The girl glared at her, "I was angry! When you're angry<br/>you don't stop to think to get dressed!"<p>Nabiki tossed dish towels at the two emotionally immature<br/>teens, "That's the problem: You don't stop to think! Look<br/>at Daddy!"<p>The girl looked away to the mustachioed man in the brown<br/>do-gi. She raised one towel and lowered the other over<br/>herself. "How long is he going to have that blank stare?"<p>Nabiki took her by a bare arm, and pulled her towards the<br/>door out, "Until you return to normal."<p>The girl bowed her head in shame under her long hair,<br/>"You're right. I shouldn't have let that jerk push my<br/>button."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It was a few minutes later before Kaneda came into the<br/>family room. He was in his blue house slippers, gray<br/>slacks, and short sleeve white shirt. Other than a tux,<br/>they were his most 'presentable' clothes. And the only<br/>reason he had them was because they were his school<br/>uniform. {Muscle doesn't work on her. "Clean and<br/>academic" will at least buy me time to find out what<br/>Ranma considers cool.}<p>The brother was in time to see Kasumi about to pour a<br/>glass of cold water on his dad.<p>The stranger in his own do-gi asked her, "What are you<br/>doing?"<p>Kasumi smiled sweetly, "This seems to be the quickest way<br/>to bring Father back when he gets this way."<p>Kaneda sighed over what had just happened. He said to<br/>himself, "At least he doesn't cry about it."<p>A second after the water splashed on him, Soun moved.<br/>"What?" he sounded as he'd been just momentarily<br/>distracted. Then, "What happened to our drinks?" noting<br/>the now empty glasses.<p>The man in the dew rag asked, "You mean he doesn't<br/>remember while he's out?" eyeing the beer still left in<br/>the large bottle.<p>Kasumi informed the guest, "He doesn't seem to. Dinner<br/>will be ready soon."<p>Soun Tendou said, "That can wait. It is time for all of<br/>us to gather. Our guests have a very tragic story to<br/>tell."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The guest was kneeling rather formally by himself on one<br/>side of the living room table. His back was to the open<br/>door that frame in night. The head of the Tendou house<br/>was kneeling nearer him than the rest of the family.<br/>Right now he was looking at his family.<p>His son was kneeling at the side of the table nearest<br/>them. The two girls were kneeling on the other, side by<br/>side, Nabiki, still in her cutoffs and shirts, nearest<br/>the stranger.<p>All that was missing was-<p>In from the garden hall came that guy from the bathroom.<br/>This time he was dressed.<p>But he was dressed in the girl's clothes! Kaneda slapped<br/>a hand on the table and got to his knees. His other hand<br/>was ready to attack, "What'd you do with Ranma!" he<br/>demanded.<p>The gray eye boy scorned, "YOU of all people haven't<br/>figured that out! How dumb are you!"<p>His father reprimanded, "You're a guest!" He stood up.<p>Dampening his anger, he said to the rest of the family,<br/>"I'm, um, Ranma Saotome." And he closed his eyes. "Sorry<br/>about everything."<p>BOOKG! Kaneda whacked his jaw against the tabletop when<br/>the feeling went out of his arms.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>All kneeling formally, now, Soun Tendou told his family,<br/>"I can explain everything." Gesturing, "This is my dear<br/>old friend..."<p>The man in the white do-gi bowed, "Genma Saotome."<br/>Gesturing, "And this is my son."<p>He said, "Ranma." He looked at them, wondering why they<br/>didn't seem to understand.<p>Kaneda growled. He wanted Ranma to be a girl. {Where IS<br/>she?}<p>Nabiki said, "This gets more interesting by the minute."<br/>There were two of them. Did something happen to mutate<br/>the genes of the fathers? (It would explain why they<br/>didn't have any irises, only pupils.) She was glad that<br/>she, at least, was normal.<p>Kasumi asked, "Are you really her, the same girl we saw<br/>before?"<p>The pigtailed boy answered, "I am."<p>Mr. Saotome pushed at his glasses, "It's such a long<br/>story I don't know where to begin."<p>He rose to his feet. "Well, then. Let's start with this."<p>And he picked up Ranma by the front of his Chinese shirt<br/>and tossed the guy towards the garden's koi pond!<p>Ranma hadn't been prepared. He screamed, unable to do<br/>anything in mid-flight.<p>SPLASH!<p>The black haired guy did not come up. But the redhead<br/>did. "What'd you do that for!" the distinctly soprano<br/>yelled.<p>Nabiki said, "Oh, my..." It's true.<p>Kasumi blinked more than she had done all day, "Ranma's...<br/>a girl now."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>...After the long and tragic story, Soun Tendou bowed his<br/>head in sympathy. "The Legendary Ground of Accursed<br/>Springs. It's true horror has been shrouded in mystery,<br/>until now."<p>Ranma couldn't take reliving the memories again any more,<br/>"What'd you mean true horror!" Turning to, "This is all<br/>your fault, old man! What's the idea of draggin' me to a<br/>place like that, anyway!"<p>Genma rose up and picked the boy up again, "Ranma! You<br/>sound like a GIRL!"<p>Yell! SPLASH!<p>"Were you not prepared to lay down your life for the sake<br/>of the Art!"<p>The small redhead jumped out of the water, and ran back<br/>at him, "My life, yes! My manhood is another story!" She<br/>threw a bucket of pond water into his pop's face.<p>The panda growled, "MWAAA!"<p>The large-busted girl growled back, "You just HAD to find<br/>that training ground, even though you couldn't speak a<br/>WORD of Chinese!"<p>The family watched the girl and beast have a two-handed-<br/>two-pawed arm wrestling match. Kaneda swallowed, {Strong<br/>girl.}<p>Soun said, "How I suffer for you. I wish there was<br/>something I could do to help."<p>Nabiki looked at Daddy, "Oh? I suppose the tea kettle<br/>just HAPPENS to be by you?"<p>Soun looked at it on a cloth on the tatami/rush grass<br/>mat. "We do have company."<p>Nabiki sighed and got up, "So WHERE'S the tea?"<p>Picking up the kettle, she walked over to the two still<br/>engaged in their test of wills. She poured it first on<br/>the animal. The man from it cried, "That's TOO hot!"<p>Nabiki quirked a satisfied smile, "I thought so. Just<br/>like Kaneda."<p>But the human moved before she could use the water on<br/>her: "Hot water!" She raised a fist, "Not boiling!"<p>Soun Tendou was on his feet at last, sounding<br/>magnanimous, "Ha, ha! Your problem isn't so terrible,<br/>after all." He took an escort grip on her arm and turned<br/>her to, "Look, my oldest daughter Kasumi, she's 19; and<br/>my youngest daughter Nabiki, she's 17. Pick either one<br/>you want. She'll be your new fiancée."<p>Soun Tendou's only son Kaneda, 16, blurted out, "What<br/>about me? She's half-girl."<p>The little redhead barked, "Just because I'm a freak,<br/>doesn't mean I'm marryin' a freak!"<p>It was Kaneda's turn to rise to his feet, "Who're you<br/>calling a freak!"<p>Ranma stamped a small, bare foot towards him, "You,<br/>freak! Haven't you gotten it yet!" She jabbed a thumb<br/>at herself, "I ain't a girl! I'm all guy!" She stomped<br/>closer, "Cold water that makes me something I ain't!"<br/>And closer, "Hot water turns me back into what I AM!"<p>Her breasts were up near Kaneda's stomach, her small chin<br/>pointed up at him. "Even if I wanted somebody with the<br/>curse-which I DON'T-you aren't girl enough for me!"<p>Kaneda was offended, "Of course I'm not really a girl."<p>That did it, Ranma had had it: "Splash some hot water in<br/>your face, and wake up! You got the SAME curse as I do,<br/>you idiot!"<p>It was finally said out loud. The ground underneath<br/>Kaneda was rocked.<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my, Father's out of it again," rising<br/>with a glass of cold water.<p>Kaneda held out a hand to stop her passing him. He took<br/>the glass from her.<p>Nabiki saw what he was going to do with the water. She<br/>looked at her entranced parental figure, "That is one<br/>major fallout shelter you're dug, Daddy."<p>The redheaded boy splashed Ranma's father. The panda was<br/>back, this time not so belligerent. Kaneda tried to grasp<br/>the truth that, "He isn't really a panda. Hot water makes<br/>him what he was born to be."<p>Nabiki offered the teakettle. Kaneda went by it as he<br/>headed down the outer hall. Kasumi asked, "Where are you<br/>going do, Kaneda?"<p>In his daze, he answered, "I'm going to take the first<br/>hot bath I've had in years."<p>The panda watched until the boy disappeared around the<br/>corner. It then hurried over to his motionless comrade.<br/>Lifting him up, he ran for the closest way out, out of<br/>the room, out of the house, out of the gate.<p>Kasumi asked, "I'll serve dinner, now."<p>Nabiki held up a hand, "Hold the dinner. There won't be<br/>time for that."<p>Ranma said, "Yeah. If she takes it anything like I took<br/>it..."<p>But then, she hadn't been living a lie all of his life.<p>The End of this chapter
