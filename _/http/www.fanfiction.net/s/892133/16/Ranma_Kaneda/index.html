</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>16: Blood, Sweat, and Torn Clothes<p>[I've changed Ch. 15 to "Fight Karma with Karma". The<br/>Kasumi storyline is gone.]<p>Ranma-chan had had enough jumping up and down. That was<br/>how she'd put all the boards in the ceiling. Gently<br/>cradling her tender boobs with an arm, she looked around<br/>for the way out. That was when she realized that they'd<br/>forgotten to put in a door, or even a doorframe. There<br/>were the two long openings along two of the walls with<br/>only the posts to show where the window frames could be.<br/>That was the way out Akane had took when Ranma had<br/>threatened her.<p>Ranma-chan groaned. It was only 2.5 meters/7.5 feet or so<br/>off the grassy ground, but just the thought of jumping<br/>DOWN even further than she had been doing with her sore<br/>boobs was more than she could take. She was a martial<br/>artist; pain wasn't the issue. It was WHAT would be<br/>hurting again.<p>Ranma-chan saw that she had two planks with nails in them<br/>left. All of that practice she'd gotten had allowed her<br/>to find the best way to drive the nails in deeply into<br/>the wood with her bare hands. "I'm gonna have to see if I<br/>can get to the point where I can just throw them in."<br/>Then she thought to herself, "Nah, I probably haven't<br/>reached that level, YET." She emphasized that "yet",<br/>because she was certain that one day she would reach<br/>master level.<p>Ranma-chan said, "I'd get there a LOT sooner, once I<br/>learn that kid Miss Hinako's chi techniques!" Only THAT<br/>is what had kept her a girl. It had nothing to do with<br/>Akane. Her head went back to the window, "SHE'S out there<br/>now with that brat principal! She's trying to beat me to<br/>the techniques!" Then she grumbled, "As if she really<br/>could get better 'n me." But there was a tinge of doubt.<p>Ranma-chan went to the planks with nails. Using her<br/>instep only, she flipped first one, then the other<br/>towards the front of the completed interior. They fell<br/>right where she wanted them to, across a section of<br/>floorboards, over their joists.<p>Screaming her battle cry, "Hyaiii!" she jumped with and<br/>on the scrap board. The planks and their nails were<br/>tramped in place.<p>Replacing the arm that held her boobs in place with her<br/>left, Ranma-chan kneeled on one of the planks. Taking aim<br/>at the floorboards between the two planks, she commented,<br/>"Every tree house needs a trapdoor."<p>A stronger battle cry, a couple of blows and the trapdoor<br/>opening was almost complete. The floorboards between the<br/>planks and juices broke straight and evenly because of<br/>Ranma's skill at karate.<p>Shifting the weight of her hooters around under her arm,<br/>she told herself, "Just one more blow, and I can use a<br/>long plank to jog-"<p>One of Kane-chan's triggered traps was set off: Ranma<br/>yelled as she was catapulted out the window she HADN'T<br/>wanted to leave by!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma's had a huge well of natural chi. She just hadn't<br/>learned how to release it properly, yet, for much of<br/>anything but mid-air maneuvers. These air-shaping powers<br/>she used to avoid breaking through the ceiling she'd just<br/>put up, and, then, aim herself.<p>Ranma landed on Kane-chan.<p>Kane-chan had been using a brace-and-bit drill to bore a<br/>hole into a tree for Miss Hinako.<p>Now Kane-chan was squashed boobs-down on the ground with<br/>Ranma-chan on top of her.<p>And though Ranma had done that much, all she could bring<br/>herself to do was clench her fists and threaten the girl,<br/>"I know you it was your fault!"<p>The tall and beautiful Miss Hinako told Ranma-chan, "Miss<br/>Ranma! Workplace accidents DO happen! Get off of Miss<br/>Akane before I put you in detention!" She used their<br/>first names because both of them said their last name was<br/>Saotome.<p>"Miss" Ranma looked up at the grownup brat. There was<br/>still a look of defiance on her cute face. Detention was<br/>no threat to HER. She'd had that or worse in just about<br/>every school she'd been in. That is where they tried to<br/>cage the outsider.<p>But in all of the travels she and Pop had endured the<br/>last ten years, of all the masters they'd petitioned to<br/>teach them their secrets, this appeared to be the closest<br/>she had yet come to learning true chi techniques. But HOW<br/>important was becoming a true martial artist master<br/>compared to her pride as a man! Her current craving to<br/>be a man!<p>Ranma-chan rose quickly in one motion. Hands together,<br/>she bowed deeply and smiled sweetly, "I am sorry, Miss<br/>Hinako! I'll try not to let my naughty temper get the<br/>better of me again." Man! She even gave herself a<br/>girlish voice.<p>Miss Hinako was aware of Ranma's male-like aura of<br/>stubbornness and violence. But the longest journey began<br/>with one step. Hinako HAD dedicated her life to working<br/>with delinquents in need of reform. "Alright, Miss Ranma,<br/>now apologize to Miss Akane, and help her to her feet."<p>"Miss" Akane was already helping herself to her own feet,<br/>"That's okay, Miss Hinako, I can do it myself!"<p>Little Miss Ranma said syrupy, "Nonsense, Miss Akane! I,<br/>because of an 'accident' (which I KNOW you're responsible<br/>for), knocked you down; it is only RIGHT I help you up!"<br/>She demonstrated just how strong she was by lifting her<br/>up, squeezing Kane-chan's bare biceps just a might too<br/>hard.<p>When Kane-chan's feet touched the ground, she said,<br/>"Thank you! NOW can I get back to doing what Miss Hinako<br/>asked me to do?"<p>Right now, to Miss Ranma the name Miss Hinako was like<br/>"Master" to a genie. Ranma looked at the drill dropped to<br/>the ground. She said, "Oo, that will take too long! We<br/>need a faster way to...uh, do whatever our Miss Hinako<br/>WANTS us to do!" Ranma-chan tried to remind herself of<br/>all of humiliations she and other pupils over the ages<br/>had had to endure to learn from their masters. This was<br/>just another form of hazing. Anything can be martial<br/>arts training...' just gotta keep remindin' yourself<br/>that.<p>Picking up the drill, Kane-chan the accomplished<br/>carpenter asked indignantly. She motioned to those chalk<br/>X's Miss Hinako had gotten around to using her power to<br/>position for best affect. "Do YOU have a martial arts<br/>solution? She wants holes through ALL of these trees<br/>around her office."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Is THAT all! Sure I, uh... Well, not<br/>yet." She looked around for one, "But it HAS to involve<br/>something long enough to through a tree."<p>Kane-chan told her, "All we have like that are these<br/>pipes for scaffolding."<p>Ranma-chan asked her, "What are you doing with METAL<br/>scaffolding? Isn't most of that in Japan done with<br/>bamboo?"<p>Kane-chan said, "And if we did use bamboo, your dad might<br/>just eat it all!"<p>Ranma-chan was about to say something, but didn't. It was<br/>ridiculous, but it was also possible with the panda's<br/>appetite.<p>Kane-chan told her the truth, "My supplier let me try it<br/>because he didn't get enough orders for the pipe."<p>Ranma-chan picked one of the pipes up, studying it; "Now<br/>we just need to put enough force behind it to ram it<br/>through the tree."<p>Miss Hinako said, "*I* can supply that."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan finished speed filing the end of one of the<br/>pipes. "Here, Ranma, I admit you're the better martial<br/>artist," she said, handing it to her.<p>Miss Hinako said Miss Ranma, "No, a little more to the<br/>right. I want this first hole aligned with that playing<br/>field. Sports activities bring out people's natural<br/>battle lusts and auras, wouldn't you say?"<p>Ranma-chan put the sharpened end of the pipe up against<br/>the trunk where she'd been directed to, above her own<br/>heart level. "Yes; of course, I've never been a team<br/>player."<p>Miss Hinako said, "Oh, really? How sad." Sounding more<br/>like her little girl self, she sounded sympathetic. The<br/>adult returned to direct, "Press that board up against<br/>the other end and hold it in place. Use both hands. No,<br/>stand directly in front of it."<p>Ranma-chan leaned against the board, "Okay. Now what?"<p>The adult Miss Hinako made a circle with her fingers,<br/>"Happo Change Returned!"<p>Her narrowed, concentrated blast of chi energy struck<br/>Ranma's core, redhead's trunk, limbs and head. It excited<br/>Ranma's own chi and exploded it away from the more potent<br/>source, Miss Hinako.<p>Ranma's chi was powerful: She was propelled violently<br/>forward. Only her skill and strength kept Ranma-chan's<br/>arms from bending.<p>She didn't slam to a stop until the other end of the pipe<br/>had been driven out the other side of the tree.<p>Ranma-chan crumpled to the ground, the two parts of the<br/>split board still in her hands above her breasts.<p>Kane-chan yelled at the now horrid and reckless kid,<br/>Hinako, "Why did you do that for! She might be hurt!"<br/>running to check on Ranma-chan.<p>Little Miss Hinako grew up quickly. She siphoned the<br/>energy of the people on the playing field through the<br/>pipe through the tree. "My attacks only hurt those who<br/>are truly destructive."<p>Kane-chan kneeled beside Ranma-chan, checking her neck's<br/>pulse and her forehead temperature, "You don't think<br/>being blown up against something's is going to HURT<br/>something! What if the pipe had broken through the<br/>board!"<p>Miss Hinako said confidently, "Miss Ranma has a very<br/>strong spirit. She would survive a simple accident like<br/>that."<p>Ranma-chan had finally recovered enough to try to get up<br/>with her fists, "Y, you couldn't have, have done it a,<br/>another way!"<p>Miss Hinako said, "The only time my techniques work on<br/>non-living things is when I get very upset."<p>Ranma-chan got to her feet; her blood was returning to<br/>her body, especially her eyes, "You brat! You DID do<br/>that on, on purpose!"<p>Kane-chan gripped at the back of her shirt, "Ranma,<br/>you're here to LEARN from Miss Hinako! You DON'T want to<br/>get her "very upset"!"<p>Miss Hinako said in a tone that was both a pledge and a<br/>threat, "I do my best to keep from getting upset. It's<br/>not a very pretty sight when I am."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "And NEITHER am I!" Her battle energy<br/>was rapidly building back up.<p>Miss Hinako held up a coin, "Happo 50-yen-" She suddenly<br/>stopped her attack. "That's right. I have absorbed a lot<br/>of energy already."<p>Ranma-chan gloated, "Ha! A weakness in your technique!<br/>And what happens if you DO get too much aura like<br/>that!"<p>Kane-chan suggested, "She overloads and blows the excess<br/>back at you?" She reminded her, "-Like what happened in<br/>Assembly Hall this morning!" Miss Hinako had taken in<br/>not battle aura but weaker battle lust-but it had been<br/>of hundreds!<p>Ranma-chan told them, "I'm about ready to blow myself!"<p>Kane-chan got in front of Ranma-chan, and put her hands<br/>on the pigtailed girl's shoulders. But she looked over<br/>her own shoulder at Miss Hinako, "Perhaps you'd better<br/>hire professions to finish up for you, Miss Hinako."<p>Miss Hinako nodded, "Yes. That WAS what I had originally<br/>intended to do. Men would do a better job."<p>Ranma-chan screamed, "Oh! How many men can take the<br/>abuse you've given ME!"<p>Kane-chan leaped up into Ranma-chan's arms. She got her<br/>strongest "Clinging-to-a-Statue" hold. She told her,<br/>"You're going to have to tear me apart before I'll let<br/>you harm our, MASTER!"<p>Ranma-chan growled, loudly. "MASTER! Yeah, right! How<br/>stupid!" to have a master like THIS brat! But Akane was<br/>right. What had happened was nothing compared to some of<br/>the things his sensei Pop had done to her. And Hinako's<br/>techniques WERE just too tempting to louse up the chance<br/>to have them for her own.<p>Like having a wad of food stuck in her throat, Ranma-chan<br/>swallowed her pride. For another time!<p>Miss Hinako told them, "I give you permission to go to<br/>the clean up thoroughly. You girls are perspiring too much<br/>for ladies."<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Hey! What about your promise to tell<br/>us your secret!"<p>The very poised woman told them, "I will keep my promise.<br/>I will tell you EXACTLY how to gain my techniques. But I<br/>will only reveal my most important secrets to GOOD<br/>girls." She looked at Ranma levelly and seriously, "The<br/>first lesson IS called "Good Girl Exercise Step One"."<p>Ranma's growl could be seen but not heard. Here was<br/>another temporary defeat for his male self.<p>Acting Principal Ninomiya said, "I have things to do,<br/>now. Miss Akane, you will see that Miss Ranma is properly<br/>washed and presentable for her next class?"<p>Kane-chan wasn't comfortable with the idea of being alone<br/>with Ranma at the moment. "Uh, Akane Saotome doesn't GO<br/>to this school! She's-I'm not registered!"<p>The woman pulled a pass out of one the pockets hidden in<br/>her now very short, yellow dress. "Here. This will give<br/>you permission to use the school's facilities."<p>She then challenged Miss Ranma with a stare, "I shall ask<br/>your teachers if Miss Ranma had ALSO freshened herself<br/>up. Tomorrow we shall talk about her wearing the school<br/>uniform." She then turned to go on her business, "I have<br/>started a ledger book on your merits and demerits, Miss<br/>Saotome." There was no doubt which Miss Saotome she<br/>meant.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan stormed toward the long, concrete sink with<br/>several taps out near the gym building, "How can I<br/>"freshen up" when there's only sinks!" He had heard<br/>that unlike Japanese schools Western schools had gym<br/>showers.<p>Keeping a wary eye on her, Kane-chan trotted after Ranma-<br/>chan, "Go ahead; don't take a clean up. This IS Japan. We<br/>don't care if a girl wears the same clothes after taking<br/>a bath. Hey, she can even wear those clothes days in a<br/>row. We don't care that much what a girl smells like.<br/>It's just MISS Hinako that seems to care." Will this<br/>work? It IS weak reverse psychology. "Maybe she'll<br/>settle for you wearing perfume."<p>Ranma-chan told her, "Me!"<p>Kane-chan said, "How hot do you think the water IS? One<br/>splash and I'm a guy again." And thanks to Kasumi, I'll<br/>be wearing out of this dress just as fast. "It's like<br/>I've been saying to you, because it's harder to become a<br/>guy, stay a girl."<p>Ranma-chan turned on one of the taps, "No! I'm stayin' a<br/>guy, no matter how hard the curse makes it-And I AIN'T<br/>wearin' anything but Chinese clothes!"<p>Kane-chan smiled, "Then I'LL get Miss Hinako's<br/>techniques. I can wear either uniform." Though I LIKE<br/>getting out of the girls' as soon as I can.<p>Ranma-chan she put her wet hand in the armhole of her<br/>sleeveless shirt, "I'll show her I AM a guy!" The other<br/>hand went under the shirt's bottom.<p>Kane-chan watched her trying to clean her boobs and torso<br/>without soap, "Miss Hinako already thinks you're a GIRL<br/>that needs to be reformed. If you want to learn her "Good<br/>Girl Exercises", she's going to want to see you being<br/>one."<p>Again the definitions that defined Ranma clashed: Martial<br/>artist vs. man!<p>Suddenly Ranma-chan remembered, "Our class is scheduled<br/>to have P.E. next period! -Ow!" One hand had been on a<br/>still tender boob when it spasmed.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan followed Ranma-chan as she headed for the main<br/>building, "Are you going to skip, like you did all but<br/>one day last week?" Though I guess you didn't go to the<br/>last class of Friday.<p>Ranma-chan told her, "No! And I ain't gonna wear<br/>burumas, either! I'm gonna wear my OWN, GUY gym clothes!"<br/>At least the P.E. teacher'd like that better than her<br/>showing up in his street clothes.<p>Kane-chan said, "So, you think as long as your only<br/>demerits are for wearing guys' clothes, Miss Hinako won't<br/>force you to become a girl too fast?"<p>Ranma-chan told her, "Something like that. Thanks."<br/>Because she hadn't gotten that far in planning her excuse<br/>for showing up, again, out of yet another uniform. HER<br/>plan had been to just show up and deal with what happens<br/>after that.<p>Kane-chan told her, "Only one problem with that idea.<br/>With all that's happened you haven't gotten any gym<br/>clothes yet."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan stopped when Ranma-chan went pass girls' locker<br/>room and for the guys'. "Ranma, you're not going to STEAL<br/>a uniform!"<p>Ranma-chan went in, "I'm borrowing it! It's not stealing,<br/>if they're not using it."<p>Ranma-chan really didn't expect any guys in the locker<br/>room. It did look empty. The clock inside told her what<br/>she already had judged by the sun: The fifth period gym<br/>class wouldn't be back for a while.<p>She went down the locker doors. The third one was the<br/>charm. And it did have guys' sweats! She looked at the<br/>body covering short-sleeved shirt and long pants. "That's<br/>more like it."<p>She didn't dawdle, but then neither did she hurry<br/>shucking her sweaty clothes. While she was unfastening<br/>her red silk shirt with one hand, she was untying the<br/>white ribbon that held up her black silk pants. "I don't<br/>mind showin' the body, but why do it if you're not<br/>showin' off?" She was shrugging out of her shirt while<br/>she pulled down both her pants and boxers. "And why would<br/>I want to show off the body I'm not proud of?" Bringing<br/>in each arm through its hole while the other held the<br/>shirt, she bent over to take off the red elastic hair<br/>bands that held her baggy pants legs around her ankles.<p>Suddenly her danger sense kicked in! Ranma-chan half-spun<br/>as she leaped back to put herself in the defend/attack<br/>position. But her right foot was briefly caught until the<br/>elastic band snapped free, releasing the foot. Meanwhile,<br/>her surefootedness was broken by the brief, UNWELCOME<br/>thought that she was, maybe, seen as a naked girl in a<br/>guys' locker room.<p>Ranma-chan stumbled, and fell against the lockers. She<br/>landed on her padded butt, her raised knees falling<br/>apart. Still, her hands were out to strike whoever was-<p>Blood was sprayed over her naked boobs.<p>Ranma-chan was about to accuse, "Kane-" Then she saw the<br/>very pale, half-skeleton of a guy standing in a locker.<br/>He'd been frozen by the sight of a girl in the locker<br/>room, and THEN the girl undressing before his nose blew.<br/>(Blood was dripping heavily from his nose.)<p>Hiraku Gosunkugi stared at the naked girl staring at him.<br/>Suddenly he became frightened. "I'm sorry!" he yelped as<br/>he slammed the locker door shut.<p>Ranma-chan sat up, wondering, "I was afraid of that?"<br/>She reflexively wiped at the blood. "Why would I be<br/>warned about HIM!" Her hand and soft and jiggling boobs<br/>reminded her that she didn't have her normal muscular<br/>chest. "Disgusting!" she said taking her hand away the<br/>curses.<p>Gosunkugi cried, "I'm sorry!" from inside his locker.<p>Ranma-chan saw her hand was smeared with, "Blood. THAT'S<br/>what my senses were noticin'."<p>Suddenly, those same senses warned of an attack from<br/>another direction.<p>Blood again!<p>Ranma-chan cried, "KANEDA!"<p>Kaneda was dripping blood over HIS boys' uniform, now. "I<br/>THOUGHT I was prepared to see you, uh, like this."<p>The cute redhead looked down at her red spotted and<br/>smeared mounds. "In all my battles up till now, I don't<br/>think I've ever seen this much blood."<p>(Gosunkugi cried, "I'm sorry!")<p>Kaneda looking away for something for his nose, said,<br/>"This blood's nothing." Don't tell her that! I don't<br/>think Ranma's ready to hear about periods. Better leave<br/>that to a real girl like Kasumi.<p>Ranma-chan got up, grumbling, "I never got this kinda<br/>Bloody attention before." She picked her things with her.<p>Finding a small towel for his nose, Kaneda struggled to<br/>think of anything that would appeal to Ranma about being<br/>a girl (and coming right after thinking about<br/>menstruation, that was hard), "Think of it as uh, a<br/>TECHNIQUE! The "Saotome Vampire Energy Drain"!" Man! You<br/>couldn't come up with a BETTER name!<p>Ranma-chan was even less impressed, "Problem is it'd only<br/>work on virgin wimps!" And she kicked a deep dent in<br/>Gosunkugi's door.<p>Gosunkugi screamed, "I'm sorry!"<p>Ranma-chan put her frowning eyes up to the vent slots and<br/>banged her fist against the door, "Tell me why you're<br/>here!"<p>Inside, Gosunkugi closed his eyes, "My club had to find<br/>another place: You and those other women had taken over<br/>where my club meets! You were all too intimidating!" He<br/>shuddered, "Especially that tall, adult woman."<p>Ranma-chan was suspicious, "Yeah? What kinda club meets<br/>out among a buncha trees?"<p>Gosunkugi told the girl, "It's, it's the Voodoo Club! We<br/>make straw dolls, and then hammer spikes through<br/>them...into tress."<p>It took a moment for Ranma-chan to say, "Unh, hunh. You<br/>play with dolls. Just what I need to be seen doing in<br/>this body." And she left for the door, putting on only<br/>her outer red shirt. She carried her other clothes over<br/>her arm.<p>Gosunkugi added, "We also do OTHER black magic!"<p>Kaneda hurried to follow after the pistoning buttocks of<br/>Ranma-When HE was sprayed by blood coming out of the<br/>locker's vent.<p>Kaneda banged another dent into the door: "Hey! No<br/>peeking! That's MY girl!" And he stuffed the towel into<br/>the vent holes.<p>The bare naked Ranma-chan told him, "I'm not your girl!"<p>Kaneda was hit and buried under a barrage of balls of all<br/>kinds.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>For the short trip to the guys' room, Ranma hadn't<br/>bothered to put on her pants. The shirt was long enough<br/>to cover anything that was supposed to be covered.<br/>Stepping up to the long, enamel sink in the guys' room,<br/>she looked at the blood spatters that got on her clothes,<br/>"Just great. Other than my kempo-gi, these clothes are<br/>about ALL I have! This means I have to use COLD water to<br/>get the blood out before it sets. I hate cold water!" The<br/>confident martial artist stubbornly persisted in acting<br/>as if she were still a guy, right to the point of taking<br/>off her shirt again. Only then did she think to put on<br/>the pants again, if only so she wouldn't have to look at<br/>what was missing.<p>Suddenly, the mummy Tatewaki Kuno burst into the rest<br/>room: "My lackey was correct: It IS the Pigtailed Ranma<br/>in all of her glory!"<p>A small ninja type peeked out from behind his master.<br/>"Oh, my! I really hadn't expected her to be THIS brazen."<p>Ranma-chan looked at the tall, bandaged and idiot in the<br/>kendo-gi in surprise. "Oh, this is wonderful: My senses<br/>must not take this guy seriously enough to warn me! But<br/>that geeky wimp, it does."<p>Kuno heard what he wanted to hear, "My Juliet said the<br/>sight of her Romeo is wonderful! I COME to thee, My Sun<br/>Goddess!" He had come with his sword to defend her honor<br/>inside the boys' locker, and then the lav.<p>Ranma-chan tossed the wet clothes in the sink, and<br/>stepped over to where the creep could get a clearer<br/>charge at her: "Come on! I took you down the last time!"<p>Kuno chortled, "Such double entendre!"<p>Sasuke Sarugakure cried to his master, "Watch out-"<br/>before he was trampled.<p>Kaneda screamed, "Keep your manicured hands off Ranma!"<br/>The sight of Ranma he had seen at the doorway was a<br/>small, naked, soft and cute redhead with great chichis:<br/>He lost it! He completely forgot his martial arts<br/>training as he leaped on the samurai boy, and started<br/>wailing.<p>The force of the rear assault was to cause Kuno to<br/>stumble forward.<p>Ranma yelled at Kaneda, "This is MY fight! Stay! Out!<br/>Of! It!" She hoisted herself up by the rim of the sink,<br/>and lifted her legs to kick them both away.<p>And she didn't think to keep those legs together.<p>His nose spewing blood again, Kaneda cried, "Don't<br/>look!" covering Kuno's eyes.<p>Kuno cried, "Oh, the inhumanity of my fellow-"<p>Sasuke said, "I'll aid you, my-" But he dove onto the<br/>floor just in time. The wild haired redhaired guy and<br/>Master Kuno flew over his short, prostrate body.<p>Kaneda got his legs up in time to meet the wall opposite<br/>the sink. He used his new "Tendou Lower Body Whip-Crack"<br/>technique to kick him and Kuno away from the wall.<p>It WAS still new and unpracticed. The off-center thrust<br/>sent them stumbling.<p>Ranma-chan got an idea. She turned on the hot water, and<br/>directed the spray with her hand.<p>The nude Ranma-chan raised a foot to send the two other<br/>guys over onto the floor.<p>Akane found herself under the weight of Kuno!<p>(Sasuke lifted his hands to peek out, "Where did that<br/>other lady come from? The Master has clear field with TWO<br/>girls in the men's facilities?")<p>Kuno lifted himself onto his knees, and searching for his<br/>fallen bokken. "I shall smite you for keeping me from<br/>seeing My Sun!" It took him a moment to realize that he<br/>wasn't straddling any male.<p>In that moment Akane's blouse and jumper were getting<br/>soaked with hot water. The dress's bib did interfere with<br/>the wet-shirt effect. But Kuno did see the straps and<br/>part of her bra's polka dot cups.<p>The disheveled Akane told him, "Get away from me, jerk!"<br/>lashing up at him.<p>Kuno grabbed her wrist, and yanked her up to him. "My<br/>Wild Haired Huntress!" His other arm hugged her tightly<br/>to him, "You have captured my heart!"<p>Ranma-chan snickered as she leaned her bare ass against<br/>the sink, "That's right, Kuno, she's ALL yours to try and<br/>date."<p>Akane yelled, "I'll do more to your heart than hold it,<br/>if you don't let GO of me!" She still had ONE arm half<br/>untrapped under the heavier samurai's left arm. Waving it<br/>about it up and down, she loosened it from Kuno's grip<br/>enough to try a Tendou Upper Body Technique on parts of<br/>his face, when-<p>Kuno pushed her away, sobbing. "Oh, cruel, cruel accident<br/>along the True Path of Love! Oh, that I be shielded from<br/>the warm and heated embrace of My Flame by this armor<br/>against amour!" In frustration, he tore off the knot that<br/>held his bandage in place. "Do not heave a chaste sigh<br/>over a maiden's opportunity lost, we shall soon both be<br/>free of what separates us!" As the bandage unwound, Kuno<br/>was shrugging out of his gi coat.<p>Ranma-chan asked Akane, "I know why I let him yammer on.<br/>Why did you?"<p>POW! Akane's blow was so powerful it sent Kuno sideways<br/>to land in a sprawl on the floor on the other side or<br/>Ranma-chan.<p>(Sasuke cried, "Master!" going to him.)<p>Dripping wet, Akane got up on a foot and a knee, "I was<br/>surprised, OKAY! Kuno let go of me and started orating<br/>again! Who listens to what HE says!"<p>Ranma-chan smiled, "Is that all? Maybe your girl feelings<br/>were comin' out." She was STILL directing the hot water<br/>at Akane.<p>Akane approached her, "You want GIRL feelings!"<p>Too late, Ranma-chan saw what the black haired girl was<br/>reaching for. She scorned, "You're threatening me with my<br/>own clothes?"<p>Kaneda used his Whip-Crack to send Ranma's red, Chinese<br/>shirt to slap Kuno in the face.<p>(Sasuke was surprised, not wanting to dwell on forbidden<br/>fruit, he had been keeping his attention on his master.)<p>Kuno came to, "What's this! An article of clothing of<br/>My Beloved!" His heart swelled, "This token of her<br/>affection tells more than her moist lips can!"<p>The nubile girl said, "You want to play THAT game, do<br/>you!" turning on the hot water of ALL the taps.<p>Kaneda grabbed Ranma's cold wet clothes to as a shield to<br/>neutralize the hot being sprayed and splashed at him.<p>Ranma-chan decided to use the clothes to PULL the Kaneda<br/>in.<p>Kuno cried, "Unmitigated reprobate! Stealing a lady's<br/>clothes!" He was charging before he was fully on his<br/>feet, "Give ME My Lady's vestments!"<p>But, 'somehow', the au naturel Ranma-chan just happened<br/>to be on his way.<p>Her danger sense warning her this time, all Kuno touched<br/>was a well-turned ankle against shin, and strong fingers<br/>that directed him INTO the sink:<p>Slash!<p>(Sasuke cried, "Master!" Again he missed the change.)<p>Ranma-chan yanked her pants away from Akane.<p>Akane grabbed at them...Just as Kuno blindly struggled to<br/>get out of the sink.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Hey! Watch the boobs -and butt!"<p>A guy cried, " "Boobs"!"/ Another said, "Butt?"<p>Both Ranma-chan and Kane-chan's heads snapped on their<br/>graceful necks to the guys' room door: Guys with and<br/>without sweaty shirts were standing just inside, in and<br/>outside the doorway.<p>The stillness was broken when one guy confirmed, "There<br/>are girls in the guys' room!"<p>Ranma-chan and Kane-chan defensively backed up, looking<br/>for more room to maneuver.<p>Then the flood: "And one of 'em is buck, spanking<br/>naked!"/ "NAKED!"/ "Big, chichi, cute naked!"/<br/>"And the other one looks like she was about to join the<br/>redhead!"/ "And she's cute, too!"<p>Then: Let's join THEM!" It had started out as a simple<br/>call for a little "guys' fun".<p>But as the guys rushed for the girls, things quickly<br/>escalated. They ended up pulling and pushing, tripping,<br/>leapfrogging, trampling, and ankle-biting each other.<p>And that was the just the preliminaries. The main event<br/>where the fifth period gym and club guys tried to<br/>volunteer for nude martial arts lessons was much more<br/>violent and noisy. "I recognize the pigtailed girl!"/<br/>"That's Kaneda's girl!"/ "The guy who always beats<br/>us!"/ "And he's going to beat us again for this!"/<br/>"If we're going to get beat up anyway-"/ "Yes! Let's<br/>make it worth while!"/ "Go for it!" This day they<br/>earned the name "Hentai Horde". The story would grow, and<br/>become the stuff of legends.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan, her limp, wet uniform practically shredded was<br/>the first to escape. Taking up the taller girl's rear<br/>view, the still starkers and mauled Ranma-chan was the<br/>next to battle her way out into the hall.<p>Kane-chan told Ranma-chan, "I THINK we need to practice<br/>more as girls! We should have been able to beat these<br/>guys easily!"<p>Not all of their assailants recognized their defeat. The<br/>two girls were followed by bloody nosed guys who also had<br/>on tattered clothes. They were spurred on with, "For our<br/>honor as men!" His idea of how to treat girls obviously<br/>came from hentai mangas.<p>Ranma-chan told Kane-chan, "Now's the time to fight<br/>again: We're out where we have maneuvering room!"<p>Kane-chan took Ranma-chan by the wrist, "No! I've got a<br/>better idea!" Thinking the stupid girl might have an idea<br/>Ranma-chan let herself be led. Akane, after all, knew the<br/>where everything was at this school better than Ranma<br/>did.<p>MUCH better: Too late, Ranma-chan saw that she'd been<br/>pulled to, "The girls' lockers! Oh, no! I'd rather face<br/>the-" Kane-chan got her in with quick jujitsu.<p>The half-dressed and girls in just panties inside cried,<br/>yelled, and screamed when they saw the condition of the<br/>girls who'd made the surprising entrance.<p>Kane-chan yelled, "We were attacked by guys!"<p>Ranma-chan got her hand out of Kane-chan's grip. She<br/>looked coolly at her, "You really aren't a man, are you."<br/>But Kane-chan HAD gotten her in the girls' locker where<br/>she'd wanted her in the first place.<p>The girls cried, "Guys!"/ "Guys!"/ "Just like<br/>guys!"/ " 'Bet my brother was among them."/ "You poor<br/>girls!"/ "POOR! How would YOU like have your clothes<br/>ripped from your body by a mob of hormone crazed<br/>boys!"/ "You don't have to be so GRAPHIC about it,<br/>Bianka."/ "Stop talking! Get these victims some<br/>clothes!"/ "Right! Clothes!"<p>While others of the female horde approached them, Ranma-<br/>chan started backing up. She would RATHER face the lust-<br/>crazed guys than this smothering opposite of all that was<br/>hentai.<p>"Somebody go get a teacher or somebody!"/ "I'M not<br/>going out there where those creeps are waiting!/ "Take<br/>a team with you!"/ "Only if I'M on the inside."/ "If<br/>we can get word to the principal-"/ "THAT kid!"/<br/>"At LEAST she's a girl!"/ "A little girl!"/ "What can<br/>a kid do!"<p>That did it! Ranma-chan turned for the door out.<p>Kane-chan crashed through it first, screaming in panic:<br/>"I tried! I can't do it! I have to get out!"<p>Ranma-chan stood there wondering what had caused that! It<br/>was as if Kane-chan had a...phobia?<p>First one hand, then another was pull toward a different<br/>girl; while other girls swarmed around Ranma-chan. She<br/>realized just how short she was with bra-clad and unclad<br/>boobs sticking out near her face. Hips almost touched her<br/>lower abdomen, and her butt grazed against thighs as she<br/>flinched this way and that.<p>And all the while, girls talked to her: "How did it<br/>happen?"/ "Was it Tendou's fault!"/ "That's right:<br/>You're that girl! His fiancée!"/ "This is Ranma?"/<br/>"How many OTHER girls around here have hair that color!"/<br/>"Is it dyed?" a very badly done blonde asked, physically<br/>checking Ranma-chan's roots.<p>Ranma-chan said, "What is WITH every girl havin' to know<br/>if it's DYED!" She wanted to take the girl's hand out<br/>of her hair. Only with all the girl flesh so close at<br/>hand, it was hard to make any movement without touching<br/>humid skin.<p>"Here! She can use this school jacket I forgot to take<br/>home! Hope you don't mind it being in my locker for a few<br/>weeks."/ "Mi-gan! You DID take my slip last week!"/<br/>"Oh, OKAY! Hmph! I was planning to go home early anyway.<br/>Ranma can have my dress. (And blouse, too, I guess.)"/<br/>"Nice try, Omi, but everybody can see you're a B bust!"/<br/>"Wow!" another girl said, staring, "Ranma's D's ARE<br/>real!"<p>Ranma-chan hugged her D's: "Don't touch!"<p>"Ooo, sensitive!"<p>Ranma-chan told her, "Very!" Her arms over her chests,<br/>she made to bull her way through the females that see she<br/>was serious and move aside.<p>Instead, they placed their hands on her bare shoulders<br/>and hips, turning her around: "Before you get dressed, go<br/>to the girls' room."/ "Clean those wounds."/ "It'll<br/>make you feel less dirty."/ "It'll help you relax."/<br/>"We don't have a shower, but maybe some hot water-"<p>Ranma-chan's bare back bumped up against girl parts, "No<br/>hot water!" She was ready to push against, and grab soft<br/>skin to keep THAT from happening!<p>One girl put her arms around Ranma and hugged, "It's<br/>okay, girl! We understand."<p>Another asked, "We do?"<p>The girl that had tried to touch Ranma-chan's size D's,<br/>now put her hand on the small of the redhead's back,<br/>"Miyo, Ranma's SENSITIVE! Hot water causes her skin to<br/>get splotchy or something."<p>Miyo asked, "It does?"<p>Ranma-chan told them, "Put me under hot water, and it<br/>won't be a pretty sight. I won't be pretty at all."<p>Miyo said, "Aw, how sad." Others showed their sympathy.<p>Ranma-chan was asked, "Do you want us you to escort you<br/>anywhere?"<p>Short Ranma-chan told the sea of girls she was drowning<br/>in, "No! I just want to get out of here!"<p>The girl who was hugging, took an arm away to motion,<br/>"Where the clothes for Ranma?"<p>The door suddenly opened, and sopping wet clothes were<br/>tossed in.<p>The clammy damp made the pair of girls they hit scream and<br/>get out of any more attacks. Ranma-chan saw the way out<br/>of this nightmare clear.<p>But, then, she saw that the clothes that had been tossed<br/>in were her own clothes. Or what was LEFT of her red and<br/>black, silk shirt and pants, cotton undershirt and<br/>boxers. The same thing that had happened to Kane-chan's<br/>uniform had happened to Ranma's Chinese clothes.<p>Ranma-chan fell to her knees not caring WHAT she bumped,<br/>as she screamed, "NO! I need Chinese clothes! I'd<br/>rather die than go without them!"<p>The End of this chapter<br/>[For those who don't think Ranma would allow himself to<br/>be a girl for even a powerful technique, just remember<br/>"Martial Arts Dining" and "Martial Arts Tea Ceremony".]
