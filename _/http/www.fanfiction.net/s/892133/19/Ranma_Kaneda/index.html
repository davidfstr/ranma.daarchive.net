</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>19: Served Cold<p>The well-built 162 cm/64" teenage girl made a dash down<br/>the upstairs hall wearing just her polka dot bra and<br/>panties; angrily she yelled, "Don't you understand: I<br/>don't want to fight you! That's NOT the way I want<br/>things! I don't fight girls, either!"<p>The better built 157 cm/62" teenage girl jogged behind<br/>her in baggy, black, silk pants suit; she almost casually<br/>said, "You just want to fight me when I'm not a girl."<p>Her loose, long, black hair whipped as Kane-chan turned<br/>the corner away from her room, "Then be a girl!"<p>The pigtailed Ranma-chan kept going, "And let you be a<br/>guy?" The redhead ricocheted off the wall between<br/>Nabiki's and Kasumi's doors.<p>Kane-chan tried to pull the lav door shut in her face,<br/>"I'll be one as soon as I get to the water!"<p>Ranma-chan stopped it with one small foot, "I'll only<br/>make it hot with my "Saotome Instant Hot Water Attack"!"<p>Kane-chan's hand moved to the sink's tap. But she didn't<br/>turn it on.<p>Ranma-chan saw she was coming to see that, "It's a fair<br/>match. I can change you into a girl as easily as you to<br/>change me." Well, that wasn't quite true. Besides having<br/>to create enough friction, a certain intensity of battle<br/>aura was needed. Its Chi energy not only amplified the<br/>heat, it also kept her from burning her hands.<p>Kane-chan did see. It was still true that Ranma was more<br/>likely to change than Kaneda was. There was just MORE<br/>cold water around. That was Kaneda's chief argument why<br/>Ranma should stay a girl. But the pressure that had<br/>seemed to come from all sides for Ranma to be a girl had<br/>caused her to click onto a piece of the puzzle. It had<br/>actually spurred Ranma's fighting spirit to adjust FASTER<br/>to her curse than she would have without them. And now<br/>Ranma had started to regain her balance after these last<br/>hectic days since she arrived at the Tendous.<p>Now the question was just how serious Ranma was about<br/>having Kane-chan stay in her girl form?<p>Head held high, Kane-chan walked out, getting some<br/>satisfaction from making Ranma-chan step aside for her.<p>There was one thing Kane-chan knew: ONE of them had to be<br/>the girl.<p>Kane-chan jiggled down the hall in her just her taffeta<br/>lingerie for her bedroom.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Ranma-chan followed Kane-chan down downstairs, "You're<br/>just stallin'. If you really need one, an ordinary bra<br/>will do."<p>Kane-chan was in her spare yellow do-gi, and was wearing<br/>something with it Kaneda normally didn't wear, a tee<br/>shirt, "Look, not all of us can be battle maidens, like<br/>you!" Her natural anger was still there, but she was<br/>trying to keep it low. "Of course, if you want to prove<br/>how tough you are, WEAR an ordinary bra while you're<br/>fighting."<p>Ranma-chan said, "I'm not gonna wear a bra."<p>Kane-chan said, "And I really don't want you to." She was<br/>serious. The busty Ranma-chan put on more of a show that<br/>way.<p>Meanwhile Kane-chan was glad when she got to the bottom<br/>of the stairs and didn't have to think about her own<br/>show. "I promise, if Kasumi hasn't bought me a sports<br/>bra, I'll let her tell me how to wrap my chest."<p>Ranma-chan's slender brows knit, "That'll delay things at<br/>least until its time for supper."<p>The blackhaired girl slowed as she looked over her<br/>shoulder, "Why DO you want to spar with me like this?<br/>It'd make more sense to recalibrate your martial arts<br/>skills against a guy.<p>"Or do you plan on fighting a lot of girls?" Perhaps the<br/>girl in front of you? If she's decided she can take me on<br/>when we're both girls, I lose the one of the very few<br/>edges I have over Ranma.<p>But Ranma hadn't gone that far in her adjustment, "When<br/>you started your martial arts trainin', did your sensei<br/>prefer you learn with somebody your own age and level?"<p>Kane-chan turned around again, "My dad's the dojo master.<br/>I used to spar with him a lot!"<p>The cute redhead said, "But he had to hold back. You<br/>needed somebody about my own height, and weight and such<br/>to establish your norm. Once I got a feel for what I'm<br/>startin' out with, I can THEN challenge it. -And so do<br/>you! I know you could've done better in the guys' can<br/>today when you were the girl."<p>Kane-chan wasn't in the mood to admit Ranma-chan might<br/>know what she was talking about. But it did have her want<br/>to marry her and make her a partner in running the family<br/>dojo that much more.<p>Ranma-chan sneezed. "Is somebody talkin' about me?"<p>Kane-chan said, "If you sneezed every time somebody<br/>talked about you, you'd sound like a bad day in allergy<br/>season."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Inside the kitchen with Kasumi was Nabiki. The bobbed<br/>girl in the shorts and loose tee shirt over a halter<br/>smiled at them, "And speak of the young lady." Kane-chan<br/>knew that Nabiki had purposely placed herself next to<br/>Kasumi for the big confrontation.<p>Ranma-chan pushed Kane-chan aside, "I haven't 'thanked'<br/>you yet for makin' everybody think I really AM a girl!"<p>Kasumi asked, "Oh, my! Nabiki, what have you done?"<p>The coppery Nabiki explained, "I just did what you both<br/>wanted. I got little brother his fiancee."<p>Ranma-chan said, trying to control her rage, "I TELL<br/>myself I don't fight girls!" She looked around the<br/>kitchen, "But there are other things I can do!"<p>Kane-chan told Kasumi, "Nabiki told everybody in Assembly<br/>Hall about Ranma being BORN a girl!" Unlike Nabiki,<br/>Kaneda invested a lot of belief in that.<p>Ranma-chan cried, "What'd you mean "ABOUT"!" She was<br/>holding sticks of yakitori between each finger of each<br/>fist.<p>If Kane-chan's wish wasn't going to go unchallenged, at<br/>least she could believe Ranma was always meant to be a<br/>girl. It wasn't a big leap for somebody who believed she<br/>was meant to be a guy.<p>The mistress of the house got in the way of Ranma's aim<br/>at Nabiki. Kasumi pleaded, "This is for supper!"<p>Still confident in her emotional aikido skill, Nabiki<br/>made the smaller redhead an offer, "It WILL cost much<br/>less to get the documentation to prove Kei Tendou<br/>exists."<p>Kasumi asked, "Kei Tendou? Is he a relative of-" She<br/>closed the refrigerator door, "Please, let's not waste<br/>food." She was ignoring that Ranma-kun was capable of<br/>turning the yakitori skewers into serious weapons.<p>Ranma-kun took a step to the right, found his target, and<br/>flicked his wrists. The pieces of meat flew off the<br/>skewers and would've hit Nabiki if Kane-chan hadn't<br/>pushed his arm at the last second. Kane-chan told Ranma,<br/>"You don't fight girls? Haven't you heard of food<br/>fights?"<p>Nabiki calmly ignored the solid sounds the impact of the<br/>chicken made around her. She was concentrating on<br/>justifying what she'd done, "And I hear Ranma's already<br/>getting the sympathy vote at school. That'll help when<br/>she tries to show up as a guy."<p>The redhead grabbed some dishes; "What does THAT mean!"<p>Nabiki folded her arms, "Which is the bigger pervert: A<br/>girl who changes into a guy?" She gave her most<br/>challenging gaze, "Or a guy who changes into a girl?"<p>Ranma said defiantly, "I AM a guy!" She was momentarily<br/>distracted from using his weapons. Nabiki had a hold on<br/>Ranma's emotions through his chi.<p>Brown-eyed Nabiki looked at her evenly, "Just as your<br/>daddy raised you to believe. You'd do just about anything<br/>to live the life he's laid out for you."<p>As the belittled girl raised the dishes, Kasumi took them<br/>from the pigtailed girl, "And THIS is a waste of money!"<p>Nabiki said, "Anything you break in the house, you'll<br/>have to pay for."<p>Kane-chan tossed something, "Here, Ranma, use this!"<p>Ranma caught the half-full, galvanized pail. Nabiki, too<br/>late, saw that Kane-chan was holding a mop. That meant<br/>that the pail had-<p>Splash!<p>Only Nabiki's assertion of her dignity kept the drenched<br/>oneesan from screaming in outrage.<p>Kane-chan smiled at the sister who liked to taunt her,<br/>"Join the club."<p>Ranma almost smiled, "Yeah, when you look at it that way,<br/>it is almost satisfying."<p>Eldest sister Kasumi looked at Nabiki with some sympathy,<br/>but said, "Oh, my! Well, at least nothing was wasted.<br/>That was water I was recycling from the bath."<p>Wet Nabiki's hair was closer to her head now; "Now I'M<br/>going to have to take a bath."<p>Ranma-chan's smile got bigger, "This does get better. *I*<br/>know how irritatin' it is to have to take more 'n one<br/>bath a day."<p>Mischievous Kane-chan put a pitcher under the kitchen<br/>tap, "We'll be waiting when you're finished, Nabiki." It<br/>was while she was doing this that Kane-chan noticed the<br/>pervasive, strong but low-level energy of had shifted<br/>away from Nabiki.<p>Kasumi looked around, saying, "It IS better to use clean<br/>water than dirty. Especially in the kitchen." She'd have<br/>to do a little extra cleaning, but it apparently hadn't<br/>damaged anything or gotten in any food. "Just be careful<br/>around the paper walls and tatami mats. Those ARE<br/>expensive."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi said to Kane-chan, "Yes, I have some sports bras<br/>waiting for you.<p>"Here, Akane, watch things for me while I get you one."<p>Ranma-chan watched the only woman of the house leave. "Is<br/>this gonna take long?"<p>The girl in the do-gi stirred the pot with some force,<br/>"Why are you so impatient? We can spar after supper."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Sparrin's always better on an empty<br/>stomach."<p>Kane-chan saw that oneesan hadn't put in all of the<br/>ingredients. "Just think of it as training; you can't<br/>always plan your fights according around your meal<br/>times." She put in both the chopped and unchopped<br/>scallions, the whole carrots, daikon radish, and whatever<br/>else she could find in soup.<p>The pigtailed girl told her, "I'm tryin' to establish a<br/>baseline for this body, I-" She stopped to ask, "What<br/>are you doin'?"<p>Kane-chan told her, "I'm helping Kasumi," picking up the<br/>condiments near the pot.<p>Ranma-chan said, "I'm glad you've decided to act like a<br/>girl, but-"<p>Suddenly Kane-chan squeezed too hard on box of salt, "I'm<br/>NOT trying to cook! -Oh, no! Look at all the salt that<br/>got in there!"<p>Ranma-chan peeked into the pot. "Talk about a waste of<br/>food."<p>The wildhaired girl had begun to panic, "No, it's not!<br/>The opposite of salt is sugar! I'll just put the same<br/>amount of sugar in!"<p>Ranma said, "Sugar is NOT the antidote to salt!"<p>But Kane-chan wasn't listening, "If YOU think you know<br/>how to cook, tell me what IS?" She reached for the<br/>spices.<p>Ranma-chan grabbed Kane-chan's hand before she could<br/>waste again.<p>But Kane-chan picked the nutmeg up with her left; "We've<br/>HAVE to have this for supper!" After dumping those in,<br/>she picked up the thyme, "We HAVE to save this!"<p>Ranma-chan told her, "Nothing's gonna save this!"<p>The blackhaired girl dumped in bay leaves, "But Kasumi is<br/>changing her banks!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Make sense!" And she grabbed both of<br/>the girl's arms, "And STOP making things worse!"<p>Kasumi said, a look of real worry on her face, "That's<br/>exactly what's happening! Nabiki came in here because she<br/>thought Kasumi would protect her from you..."<p>Now Ranma-chan KNEW Kane-chan'd lost it, "Your big<br/>sister, Kasumi, protect anybody?"<p>Kane-chan's dark eyes was lost to the here-and-now,<br/>"...But when Kasumi found out what Nabiki had done, she<br/>LET Nabiki be punished! She withdrew her favor!"<p>Ranma-chan, of course, was familiar with the traditional<br/>way the Japanese punished one of their own. It was<br/>something a Behaviorist would understand. "Nabiki's<br/>persona non grata?" She smiled, "Until she's bows and<br/>begs forgiveness, she's to be ignored by everybody!"<br/>Ranma didn't think Nabiki could humble herself easily.<br/>That made the prospect of seeing her do it even MORE<br/>appealing to Ranma. Of course, as an outsider, I'd have<br/>to spy to see that.<p>Kane-chan shook her head, "Kasumi can't stay mad at<br/>anybody. But she IS going to let what's going to happen<br/>happen. She's not going to intervene to protect Nabiki<br/>from her Karma. And who knows what THAT will lead to!"<p>Ranma-chan raised an eyebrow, "Uh, yeah. Sure. Your mild-<br/>mannered sister is more powerful than Karma."<p>Kane-chan glared at the pigtailed girl mocking her, "You<br/>don't think a saint or Bodhisattva can! That's<br/>what they do!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "Now you're saying your sister is-"<p>Tall and feminine Kasumi came back, "I brought you the<br/>plain white one, Akane; but I have this cute one with-"<p>Kane-chan confessed immediately, "I'm sorry, Kasumi! I<br/>ruined the soup!" What she'd sense happening around<br/>Nabiki had clearly spooked her.<p>Kasumi said, "You did?" She sounded disappointed, but not<br/>upset.<p>Ranma-chan said, "She said you're a saint." Then she got<br/>a twinkle in her blue eyes, "I guess she didn't think<br/>simple food wasn't good enough for her idol."<p>Kasumi blushed modestly, "I'm not a saint, but it was<br/>just yesterday I was told I have a pure heart." She was<br/>just being honest; it didn't cross her mind it might<br/>sound like she was bragging. She smiled to her sister,<br/>"Oh, my, I just thought of something. If you're going to<br/>get married, somebody has to do the cooking."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Unless its over an open fire, it's not<br/>gonna be me."<p>Kasumi's brow knit, "Oh, my. Firewood in the city CAN be<br/>expensive."<p>Kane-chan raised her small chin, "I'll be the one,<br/>Kasumi!"<p>Her oneesan asked, "YOU want to learn the marital arts,<br/>Akane?" This was a hopeful sign.<p>Ranma-chan said to Kane-chan, "And you say you want to be<br/>a "man". You think she's gonna punish you, too, just for<br/>ruinin' one supper?"<p>Kane-chan told her, "It's not like that! Honestly!"<p>Kasumi asked, "Punished? If you think training in the<br/>marital arts is punishment, Akane, then you shouldn't do<br/>it. It is all about having the proper spirit..."<p>Kane-chan knew she'd fallen into the river Kasumi. The<br/>current wasn't strong enough to keep her from swimming<br/>back to shore. But Kane-chan could feel how much her<br/>oneesan wanted to be assured. Somebody had to be able to<br/>take over her duties. Only then could Kasumi think about<br/>leaving this house and moving on with her life.<p>Kane-chan took one last look at Ranma-chan. Her fiancee's<br/>words earlier about how to train came back to haunt her.<br/>"...your sensei preferred you to start out with somebody<br/>your own age and level..." Ranma-chan WOULD be a better<br/>dojo master.<p>Kane-chan sighed, and bowed her head to what she owed her<br/>big sister, "If it'll make you happy, I'll try." I'd<br/>better work on getting Ranma to think the way a girl<br/>should, or I'm going to end up a *Ouch!* househusband.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Man! How very UN-manly. How Un-Japanese! thought as she<br/>pulled her tee shirt back on her. The fact that she was<br/>wearing a sports bra under it didn't argue against those<br/>thoughts. "Househusband"! It has GOT to be love. What<br/>else could make a guy volunteer for that! But one of<br/>them had to do it if Kasumi was to satisfied. It was love,<br/>alright, but more for her sister, and her Tofu-sensei.<br/>For THEY to get married, the Family had to prove they<br/>could get on without her.<p>There had to be some way to weaken her feeling of<br/>obligation, "Kasumi, why DIDN'T you tell you knew that I<br/>could change into a girl? If I knew somebody knew, I<br/>might have been a girl more often." And I could be more<br/>comfortable with being one, now.<p>Ranma-chan said, "Aw, geez! I KNEW we weren't gonna<br/>workout before supper." She grabbed the teakettle from<br/>off the stove.<p>Kasumi handed Kane-chan the vegetable platter she'd<br/>prepared; Ranma-chan was still a guest. "I've explained<br/>to you. It had to be entirely your own idea. You seemed<br/>happy as a guy, so Mother only stepped in when you were<br/>having trouble. There were only small ones when you were<br/>a child."<p>She picked up the tray barbeque sauce and leftovers she'd<br/>gotten from the refrigerator and directed them out the<br/>kitchen door, "I guess when you got older and whether you<br/>were a boy or a girl became more important, I should have<br/>stepped in and told you. You could have had somebody you<br/>could confide in, besides Nabiki." She lowered her head<br/>in shame, "The troubles you're having ARE my fault."<p>Kane-chan now felt awful, "No, Kasumi, I wasn't trying to<br/>blame anybody! Honestly!" Losing one's self to the cares<br/>of the present, and unable to see the forest for the<br/>trees seemed to be one of the conditions a person needed<br/>to be pure of heart. At least it was in naïve Kasumi's<br/>case.<p>Ranma-kun put down the kettle and picked up the pitcher,<br/>"It sounded to me like you were. But blame your Old Man,<br/>like I blame mine!"<p>Kane-chan kneed her in the back of his thigh, "Then why<br/>don't you punish HIM!" Why didn't *I* change into a guy<br/>when I had the chance? *Sigh* Because I promised I'd stay<br/>ready to spar with Ranma.<p>Ranma-kun's back broadened as he stopped the line. He<br/>turned and was about to tell the impudent girl about all<br/>the things he WAS doing to punish her pop. ...But just<br/>about every example he came up with was something he<br/>would've done to him whether or not he'd become cursed.<br/>And he DIDN'T want to let Akane know he wanted to stay<br/>engaged to her. She might take it personally.<p>Ranma-kun scowled and headed towards the family room.<br/>"Don'tcha understand ANYTHING about how family works!"<br/>she yelled back in frustration.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The line was momentarily halted again when Ranma-kun<br/>stared at Nabiki sitting casually with her father and the<br/>panda beside the family table. She had deliberately<br/>changed into the slacks, shirt and tie she'd worn in<br/>Assembly Hall when she tried to sabotage Ranma-kun's<br/>life. He WOULD enjoy seeing this all-too-sure-of-herself<br/>bitch humbled.<p>He had brought the pitcher of water.<p>Nabiki challenged him in that steady voice of hers,<br/>"Remember the paper walls and tatatmi mats, Saotome."<p>Smaller Kane-chan reminded Ranma-kun, "There's always the<br/>chance magic will dry things out again."<p>Seeing her for the first time, Soun Tendou rose from his<br/>place, "Miss Akane Saotome!" he smiled. "You shouldn't be<br/>serving. You're a GUEST in this house!"<p>Kane-chan had forgotten. His dad's shame wouldn't let him<br/>deal with Kaneda, his only son, changing into a girl.<br/>Instead, he had decided the girl WAS, in fact, a stranger<br/>who looked exactly like his dear wife. I guess it's one<br/>step forward, two steps back. At least he's TRYING to<br/>find a way to acknowledge my girl half. His subconscious<br/>probably wants to make up for ignoring the "daughter" he<br/>also had. That was as close as Kane-chan could come to<br/>admitting she wasn't meant to be a guy.<p>Kasumi smiled, pleased, "Father, Akane is practicing. She<br/>has agreed to let me teach her the marital arts."<p>Soun Tendou's smile grew brighter, "Is that correct, Miss<br/>Akane?"<p>The panda signed, [Is it?}<p>Kane-chan tried to smile, "Er, that's right, Mr. Tendou!"<br/>And as she carried the platter over the threshold, her<br/>own foot got in the way of the other.<p>Soun cried, "AKANE!"<p>Kasumi cried, "Oh, my!" seeing this food about to be<br/>wasted, too.<p>The panda signed, [Save supper!]<p>The pigtailed guy reached out with his strong, free arm<br/>catching Kane-chan under her breasts, and saving her<br/>fall.<p>But water managed to escape out of the pitcher: Splash!<p>The wet Nabiki accused, "You did that on purpose!"<p>Ranma-kun used the top of the pitcher to rescue the<br/>platter still in Kane-chan's outstretched hands. The<br/>lighter Kane-chan was mortified, I feel like a stupid,<br/>clumsy, damsel!<p>Oneesan Kasumi had entered the room now with her own<br/>tray, "Oh, my, how nice. Only the cushion got wet."<p>Nabiki said, "That's cold, sis," and then shivered a bit.<br/>The open garden door chilled the water more than it<br/>already was.<p>Kasumi went to set her tray down, "I'm sorry, Nabiki.<br/>I'll go and get some towels."<p>As Ranma-kun set Kane-chan and then the platter-balancing<br/>pitcher down, Nabiki tried to play one of her cards<br/>against him, "How much extra laundry work will Kasumi<br/>have to do if you keep pulling the water stunt, Saotome?"<p>Her father put his hand on Nabiki's hand before she could<br/>get up, "Stay, Nabiki. I want you here."<p>Coppery Nabiki stayed, but protested, "Look at me. I'm<br/>wet, Daddy."<p>The mustached man cleared his throat without looking,<br/>"Uh, hem! Yes, I know."<p>Nabiki's gold shirt was fairly thick, but wet, it clung<br/>to her body, with the red necktie weighed down into her<br/>bosom.<p>Soun asked, "Akane, if you will not consider my son, how<br/>about another of my family? Say, Nabiki?"<p>Backfaults all around the table: Kane-chan, Ranma-kun,<br/>Nabiki and the panda.<p>Nabiki was the first to regain her voice, "Daddy!" so<br/>much for her infamous self-composure.<p>'Akane' said, "You can't be serious!"<p>Soun looked very uncomfortable, but he continued on, "If<br/>I am wrong about your interest in females of the same<br/>gender, Miss Akane, I deeply apologize!"<p>The panda signed, [The problem is she IS interested only<br/>in girls!]<p>Kane-chan said, "But NOT her! She's my sister!"<p>The longhaired Soun nodded, not hearing what he didn't<br/>want to, "If you become my daughter-in-law, Nabiki would<br/>become like your sister. But if you, uh, become like a<br/>couple, you can be more."<p>Indignant Nabiki said, "I do not want to be "more". I<br/>barely tolerate being her sister."<p>With a touch of sadness, Soun almost a smile, "Then, then<br/>it is as I have wondered these past years. You feel no<br/>sense of sisterhood, of, of womanliness."<p>Nabiki nearly lost her cool over this bit of illogic, "I<br/>like guys! Believe me!"<p>Ranma-kun thought he understood, "Oh, that's why you're I<br/>see you wearin' pants whenever you're outa uniform. You<br/>like to be like them."<p>Kane-chan said to Nabiki, "You DON'T wear dresses or do<br/>the typical girl things, do you?" Before sanity ended the<br/>chance, she was going to get back at her for the times<br/>she'd tormented her.<p>Her dad nodded, saying wistfully, "No, she doesn't."<p>Nabiki frowned, "What does that prove!" Now even her<br/>damp, clinging clothes were bothering her.<p>The panda signed, [It's Karma!]<p>Ranma-kun hit the animal across its head, "You were<br/>eavesdropping outside the kitchen!"<p>Soun asked, " "Karma"?"<p>Here was an idea for a tease Kane-chan could work with,<br/>"It IS your Karma catching up with you, Nabiki. You were<br/>a GUY before this life! THAT'S why you're so lousy at<br/>being a girl!"<p>"Oh, my!" Kasumi had returned at this moment.<p>Nabiki told them, "I dress like I do because of business!<br/>People take you more seriously when you look more like a<br/>guy than a girl." Most guys WOULD be looking at her body<br/>right then.<p>Kane-chan said, "Then why don't you wear business suits?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "So you'd rather be a guy." He was half-<br/>serious. Apparently he was too earnest to tease well.<p>The panda signed, [It's Karma. In her heart, she's still<br/>a guy.]<p>Ranma-kun looked at uncombed Kane-chan, "Runs in the<br/>family, doesn't it?" This was definitely not a tease.<p>Kane-chan wasn't insulted. Nabiki was. The bobhaired girl<br/>glared at them all.<p>Kane-chan tried not to smile too hard. Nabiki's silence<br/>meant that, for once, she'd lost a battle of wits. She<br/>really wasn't under Kasumi's protection right then.<p>Kasumi came over, knelt between her and their father, and<br/>offered Nabiki one of the clean towels. Nabiki took it<br/>and used it. She knew that if she left the table now it<br/>was as good as admitting defeat. She would bide her time,<br/>and wait for an opening.<p>Meanwhile, Kasumi asked, "What is this about Karma?"<p>Nobody really wanted to tell her.<p>But Soun still felt he had to explain why he had started<br/>it. "Uh, it's about Miss Akane Saotome. She's only a<br/>guest in our house. I was trying to find a way to, uh,<br/>invite her into our family."<p>Kasumi was quite pleased, "Oh, Father! After all these<br/>years."<p>Nabiki said, "Wait until you find out HOW he wants her to<br/>join."<p>Kane-chan said, "It's your fault. You should have made<br/>Akane a Tendou in the first place. You and your grand<br/>schemes."<p>The panda signed, [Personally, I approve!]<p>Ranma-kun told it, "I think we all know why you'd want<br/>Akane engaged to somebody else. You already tried to get<br/>her and "hitched up" to her guy Kaneda."<p>Naive Kasumi was confused. " "Engaged"?" She looked over<br/>at Kane-chan.<p>Her father told her, "Well, I was wondering if there is<br/>somebody else in this family who Miss Akane can be<br/>interested in besides Kaneda."<p>Nabiki said, "I am not a lesbian."<p>Kasumi blushed, "Oh, my!"<p>Soun's blush deepened.<p>Ranma-kun said, "It's not enough he wants to give one of<br/>his daughters to ME. He really is desperate, isn't he?"<p>Kane-chan scowled at Ranma-kun, "And yours isn't! Look,<br/>just as yours is yours, this one is MY dad. The ONLY<br/>thing he's done to me, as far as I'm concerned, is not<br/>tell me the truth."<p>Ranma-kun said, "Okay, already. I get you. Family is<br/>family, and you gotta put up with them." He looked around<br/>the table, "No matter how much they try and screw up your<br/>life."<p>Kasumi hesitated. Then, "Father, if you're that-"<p>Still kneeling, Kane-chan hopped over beside Nabiki:<br/>"Don't you dare, Kasumi!" And she grabbed Nabiki's arm<br/>and leaned her head on it. "I've decided I want Nabiki<br/>after all!"<p>Nabiki's brown eyes glared down at her, "Don't think I'll<br/>let you get away with this little game."<p>Kane-chan drew upon all of times she'd watched Nabiki do<br/>you melodramatic turn: " "Game"?" She acted hurt, "If I'm<br/>serious. If I'm not, my name isn't Akane Saotome." She<br/>then glanced across the table at Ranma-kun, "-Or his<br/>name is Kei Tendou."<p>That roused Ranma, "Hey, yeah! WHO'S been playin' games<br/>with peoples lives? Ranma Saotome ISN'T a girl!"<p>Nabiki was pulling her arm free as she pushed Kane-chan<br/>away, "Are you ready to ante up and get into the game,<br/>too?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "I pass."<p>Nabiki got up, "You do have more sense than I thought."<br/>The proud tactician saw that retreat was the only option<br/>left to her at the moment.<p>As she passed Ranma-kun, he casually said, "I'm gonna<br/>wait until tomorrow at school. That'd be the best place<br/>to mess with your reputation."<p>A growl got stuck in Nabiki's throat. She turned and left<br/>the room.<p>But before she disappeared from sight, Ranma-kun called,<br/>"Nabiki!"<p>Nabiki didn't answer. She knew what was coming.<p>Splash!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The pigtailed guy set the empty pitcher back down on the<br/>table and started eating, "I might get to like this idea<br/>of getting revenge."<p>Kane-chan started eating to, smiling between bites, "And<br/>we're not breaking the Code. Well, at least not the<br/>letter." Its spirit...well, that was another matter.<p>Kasumi went to mop up the water with the extra towel<br/>she'd brought. The woman in the apron sighed sadly, "It<br/>will only cause more trouble." She knew her sister<br/>Nabiki. But she sounded as if she was resigning herself<br/>to whatever happened next, "But if this is the will of<br/>Karma."<p>Her father asked, "What did you say, Kasumi?" he was<br/>distracted by the beauty of Akane. Even in her do-gi she<br/>seemed like a work of art, well worth any price he had to<br/>pay to have it in his home. As far as he was concerned<br/>she was the double of his dear, departed wife Kimiko.<p>The panda paused in it eating, [She said Akane and Nabiki<br/>as a couple has her blessing.]<p>Kane-chan told it, "No she didn't! Kasumi's just going to<br/>tolerate it for a while." At least until the time Kasumi<br/>could see if Nabiki really did need her intervention. It<br/>would be all Karma for a while.<p>On her knees, Kasumi paused in her task; she was talking<br/>more to hear herself think than anybody else, "Nabiki<br/>hasn't gone on many dates with boys, has she?"<p>Kane-chan reminded her, "Kuno was the last one. And she<br/>only did that because he's rich."<p>Kasumi bent back to her chore again, "And she doesn't act<br/>very ladylike."<p>Ranma-kun said, "She doesn't act much like a girl at<br/>all." Of course, his stereotypical definition of what a<br/>girl should be like was more like that of Kasumi Tendou.<p>Kane-chan continued down the tease track, "Nabiki is more<br/>like a guy than a girl. She just hasn't admitted to<br/>herself she likes girls, yet."<p>Patriarch Soun Tendou, his arms crossed, nodded his head,<br/>solemnly, "Yes. I HAVE read in the paper about how<br/>difficult it is for a girl come to terms with preferences<br/>that deviate from the social norm." He continued on with<br/>his self-justification, "As her father, I am helping her<br/>come to terms with her perversion. No, wait, "perversion"<br/>is probably not the word I wanted to use." He was having<br/>trouble carrying any justification off, though. It would<br/>be easier when he could just ignore what he didn't want<br/>to see. He was very good at that.<p>Since Kasumi had been brought to look at a problem she<br/>hadn't really contemplated before, she chose not to be<br/>fooled. Her pure heart pointed her in the correct<br/>direction, "Nabiki DOES need to be motivated to become<br/>the girl I know she can be." Of course, she thought the<br/>same thing about Akane.<p>Kasumi rose. She'd made her decision. "While it is not my<br/>place to force others to adopt better manners, neither<br/>will I stop the forces that can." She smiled warmly at<br/>Kane-chan, "I am ever ready to teach the marital and<br/>other womanly arts."<p>A lump of food remained in Kane-chan's mouth. The<br/>implication was not lost on her.<p>Suddenly Ranma-kun shivered, "Brr! Close the garden door!<br/>I just felt a cold chill go through me."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>With the two fathers watching on, it had quickly gone<br/>beyond a simple sparring match. In the ten minutes or so<br/>they'd been in the dojo, Ranma-chan had barely taken two<br/>steps before she was in the air again. With her having<br/>the higher ground, as it were, it was hard for the<br/>wildhaired Kane-chan to take effective evasive action.<p>It'd been Kane-chan's tactic to stay away from the little<br/>dynamo as much as she could, using a lot of bobbing,<br/>weaving, ducking and tumbling. But just as that first day<br/>Ranma-chan arrived, the redhead was able to anticipate<br/>her movements almost before Kane-chan had made them. The<br/>result was that Ranma-chan's hands and feet were getting<br/>closer and closer to Kane-chan.<p>It was when she felt the Ranma-chan's thumbnail barely<br/>graze her cheek that Kane-chan knew she had to change her<br/>tactics. If Ranma ever gets the idea that it's okay to<br/>hit me... "Hey! This is sparring!"<p>The pigtailed girl smiled sweetly, "I guess I over<br/>compensated for the short reach." She wiped her sweat<br/>with the back of her small hand; "I will say it's easier<br/>to jump with the lighter body and better thigh muscles.<br/>Just not as fun. Not with boobs."<p>Her pop told her, "Now you see why I wanted you to get to<br/>know your body on our way back from China."<p>The redhead glared at the Old Man, "NOW you're back to<br/>wantin' me to tryin' out the girl body?" Until now, he<br/>and Mr. Tendou had been staying pretty much quiet near<br/>the wall, acting like sensei assessing their students'<br/>progress.<p>Mr. Tendou had begun crying again, "Oh, Miss Akane! You<br/>remind me so much of my dear wife Kimiko. How she loved a<br/>good fight." He then suddenly rose to his knees, "Protect<br/>yourself at all costs! Disguise your pattern: Use drunk-<br/>fu!"<p>Irritated, too, Kane-chan cried, "She wasn't a drunk!"<p>Soun Tendou begged forgiveness, "I didn't mean to imply<br/>that you are, either! I was just advising you as your..."<p>Genma wasn't about to be "out-sensei-ed" by his old<br/>comrade in adversity, "Ranma! A true martial artist must<br/>learn to turn a weakness into a strength. If your breasts<br/>are weighing you down, you must teach yourself how use<br/>them to buoy you up."<p>Pow! Ranma-chan gave him a solid blow over the head,<br/>"What kinda mental image are you havin'!"<p>Soun was more concerned about the girl Akane than the<br/>Art, "Miss Akane, if you do not like the idea of drunk-<br/>fu, may I suggest the Quixote technique? It makes<br/>excellent use of the upper body, which," and a little<br/>bragging entered his voice, "as I hope you know, is the<br/>chief emphasis of the Tendou School."<p>Before he could take her arms and demonstrate, Kane-chan<br/>fended him off by wildly flailing her arms about, "You<br/>want me to act like a demented windmill!"<p>Holding his head, Genma told Ranma, "See? She knows more<br/>about how to keep her breasts out of the way."<p>Ranma-chan was forced to study Kane-chan's movements for<br/>some clue of how she did it. "Hnh! She isn't nearly as<br/>good at it as girls who are girl all the time." She<br/>refused to acknowledge the slight heat she felt across<br/>her cheeks.<p>Soun Tendou on the other hand gave no indication he<br/>harbored such feelings, even for somebody who reminded<br/>him so strongly of his dear wife. "Excellent, Miss Akane!<br/>But a truly demented windmill would change the pitch and<br/>yaw of her vane defense."<p>Kane-chan stopped her vain defense, and actually cocked<br/>her fist back. 'Miss Akane' was sorely tempted to get the<br/>kind of satisfaction Ranma had just gotten from hitting<br/>his dad.<p>Instead she turned to head to, "Ranma? Remember what you<br/>were saying about having to put up with family?"<p>The little redhead nodded, "Yeah. It's stronger than the<br/>Code."<p>Kane-chan said, "We got around that today, too."<p>It took only a moment for Ranma-chan to understand.<br/>"Okay, now let's get all we can out of this match!" And<br/>she charged Kane-chan as she charged her.<p>They met each other with the same judo hold to their<br/>upper gi-coats. Each swung the other around-And threw<br/>the other girl at the other's father with all of their<br/>force:<p>POW! POW!<p>Both of the grown men fell limp and unconscious to the<br/>polished floor.<p>Still on her feet, Kane-chan looked over a few meters<br/>away at her, at last quiet, father. She asked Ranma-chan,<br/>"Well?"<p>Ranma-chan had been doing the same with her own pop. "I<br/>have better reasons to take out my problems on the guy<br/>who gave them to me."<p>Kane-chan nodded, "Yes, I'm afraid this isn't the answer,<br/>either." She gestured over to her, "Come on, let's take a<br/>shower."<p>Ranma-chan headed for the dojo door, "Is it safe?" She<br/>was only half serious.<p>Kane-chan was also half serious, "No, not if I become a<br/>guy again." She followed after the petit redhead.<p>Ranma-chan said, "Then I'll become a guy."<p>Kane-chan said, "Then you'll be safe."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Out in the upstairs hall, Nabiki nodded, "Yes, Kasumi.
