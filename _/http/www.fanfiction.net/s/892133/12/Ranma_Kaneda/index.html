</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<p>12: Check Mate<p>[Kuno is bandaged only a bit differently here.]<p>The battle was over, and "Lord" Kuno was laying face down<br/>on the pavement of the plaza around the condo.<p>Both Kane-chan and Nabiki went over to the for once<br/>silent samurai.<p>Nabiki asked, "So; how'd you do that, Ranma?"<p>Kane-chan thought she knew, but she didn't like making a<br/>fool of herself. She turned over still male and pushed<br/>him over onto his back with one hand. She was right: The<br/>kend-gi was had the grit from Ranma-kun's slippers on it,<br/>and the exposed skin was black-and-blue with footprints.<br/>It looked as if the vacant-eyed teen had been trampled<br/>from groin to hair. Kane-chan was impressed, "Wow, each<br/>blow hit a vulnerable spot." And more.<p>Nabiki squatted and studied the evidence, "You mean you<br/>kicked him? I couldn't even see your feet move."<p>Ranma-kun put his hands up behind his head, "Hunh! I<br/>thought "Lord" Kuno'd put up more of a fight."<p>Kane-chan asked, "What do you mean, Ranma; you took a<br/>hit, too, didn't you?"<p>Ranma-kun said, "It's nothing."<p>Kane-chan wondered just HOW superior Ranma was, "You mean<br/>right over here?" She bent down, "Is it really okay?" and<br/>poked the spot on his corset-narrowed waist she KNEW had<br/>been struck by Kuno's hard wood bokken.<p>Ranma-kun was suddenly no longer casual: His strangled<br/>his cry of agony as his hands reacted to it. He finally<br/>had to put his hands over the hurt.<p>Kane-chan was sore, A bluff! He almost had me believing<br/>he WAS at master-grade! Kane-chan stood up to him, "So<br/>it's nothing, hunh! Say! What was it that distracted you<br/>in the fight, any way?"<p>Ranma-kun held up two photos: They were Kane-chan in<br/>Kaneda's do-gi working out.<p>Kane-chan stared at them for a second. "What in the<br/>world?" Why would they take Ranma's mind off of his<br/>fight? And "What were you doing with these photos of<br/>me?" What do guys USUALLY do with pictures of girls?<br/>Suddenly she saw them as Kaneda could, if they were<br/>pictures of "real" girls, not herself. She grabbed them<br/>away from him, "I'm afraid to even ask about it."<br/>Because I don't want to THINK about it!<p>Ranma-kun cried, "What was I-KUNO had the photos!"<p>Kane-chan cried, "OH-Hrrr! NABIKI!"<p>Nabiki grinned, merrily, "Can't blame a girl for trying<br/>to make a little cash."<p>Kane-chan realized even as she scoffed, "Hah!" that as a<br/>GIRL, Nabiki could make more money off of photos of her.<p>Ranma-kun said, turning his back to her, "Hmmh! What's<br/>the big deal? Who'd want a bunch of boring shots like<br/>these, any way?" And he pulled out another photo. Talking<br/>to her over his shoulder, he showed her it was of a half-<br/>naked girl-Ranma! "You'd better start workin' on makin'<br/>yourself at least half as sexy as me, or you'll NEVER get<br/>me to take a second look, let alone marry you."<p>But what REALLY pushed Kane-chan's button was when he<br/>flicked the photo towards her!<p>Kane-chan seethed, "Ohrrr!" Like you're TOO much of a<br/>guy to care! You WANT me to think you're not bothered if<br/>I see you as a naked girl! She reached down and picked<br/>up Kuno's sword from the pavement.<p>Kane-chan chased after him, "Get back here, Ranma!"<p>Ranma was confident, and he WAS teasing. He could have<br/>easily outraced Kane-chan. Instead he let her think she<br/>had a shot at hitting him with the stick.<p>Kane-chan cried, "Okay! Let's SEE who's guy enough not<br/>to care: I'll flash out here, NOW!"<p>Nabiki put her camera to her eye; "THIS will go in my<br/>files."<p>Ranma-kun says, "She wouldn't!" But he had to turn around<br/>to find out.<p>Kane-chan jumped up into the air so she could put all of<br/>her girlish weight into hitting him with the bokken.<br/>"HA!" It struck Ranma-kun in the middle of his no longer<br/>smug face.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki was still gloating when she brought her camera<br/>down. But then she saw a large, thuggish man approach<br/>from the direction opposite that Ranma-kun and Kaneda-<br/>chan had taken. He had the look of a stereotypical<br/>yakuza, down to his flashy suit, and carefully pumped up<br/>perm; this one even had mirror shades to add to his<br/>intimidation effect. When he got close enough to her, she<br/>saw that he had what looked to be tattoos on his wrists.<br/>Yakuza had them on all of their body, from their necks to<br/>hands and ankles.<p>The taller, broader person said as if he already knew,<br/>"Nabiki Tendou?"<p>Nabiki momentarily wished she had kept up with her<br/>martial arts practice. But only momentarily. That would<br/>have subtracted time better spent doing better things,<br/>like making money. "I'm Nabiki Tendou," she said in her<br/>best Cool as an Ice Queen fashion. She would NOT be<br/>intimidated.<p>The gangster-type said, "Da boss would like to talk to<br/>you." He motioned his head towards the Mercedes-Benz a<br/>few meters up the block.<p>Her arms crossed, Tendou asked, "And who is YOUR boss?"<p>He told her, "Mr. Zyunzi Ozu."<p>Nabiki uncrossed her arms, startled, "What!" She<br/>started heading for the expensive car. The gorilla<br/>followed.<p>Sure enough, there in the back seat was a boy not too<br/>much younger than her 17 years. The only thing that kept<br/>him from being a stereotypical geek was his expensive<br/>workout sweats, and that he didn't wear glasses. She was<br/>talking to him well before she stopped beside the car,<br/>"If I knew you had anything to do with gangsters, I<br/>wouldn't have contacted you!"<p>Ozu said, "I quite understand. And I assure you I am NOT<br/>part of any larger gangster organization."<p>Tendou looked over her shoulder at the looming yakuza-<br/>wannabe, "What about him?"<p>Ozu said, "A bodyguard. And, as you may have noticed, he<br/>has a "persuasive" personality. I DO have to deal with<br/>real people once in a while."<p>Tendou still had her doubts. She looked at his wrists,<br/>"What about the tattoos."<p>Ozu got a very pleased grin, "There're not tattoos: It's<br/>an idea of mine! Show her, Jouji."<p>Tendou turned around to watch as the muscle addressed by<br/>his first name looked around for his target. He found it<br/>in the stele-like posts that marked this street's<br/>official entrance to the condo's plaza. He lifted and<br/>pointed his hand at the post Kuno had cracked and broken<br/>pieces from just by the wind-pressure of his bokken.<br/>Almost faster than Nabiki's eye could follow, something<br/>flew from his hand and struck the post. Everything<br/>cracked became shattered, falling to pavement as debris.<p>(And one piece knocked Kuno out again as he was sitting<br/>up.)<p>Tendou cocked an eyebrow as her concession that it was a<br/>"persuasive" demonstration.<p>Ozu told his man, "Jouji, show Miss Tendou your wrist."<br/>As Jouji lifted his wrist, Tendou saw that the tattoos<br/>weren't real; instead they were colored markings on,<br/>"...A space-age polymer that I found a new use for. There<br/>are bands of them around his wrist. With a mere practiced<br/>motion of his hand, he can send one or more out at a<br/>classified range with classified destructiveness. It<br/>avoids the anti-gun laws of Japan quite nicely."<p>Tendou said, "I see: You have souped-up rubber bands. How<br/>very elementary, as in school."<p>Ozu was not pleased with the characterization; "The<br/>polymer surrounds OTHER parts of his body, as well.<br/>THERE, it has other uses."<p>Jouji spoke, "It doesn't breathe. It's hot, and it chafes<br/>me. It makes me grouchy."<p>Tendou was still Nabiki in attitude, "All very good for<br/>the role of the guy you don't want to say "No" to." She<br/>turned to the boy in the car, "But I'm STILL not sure I<br/>want to do business with you. Are sure you're not<br/>Yakuza?"<p>Ozu said, "And pay the organization a percentage? It<br/>would cut into my profits."<p>THAT was something Nabiki Tendou could relate to. But how<br/>could Little Zyunzi trust...Oh! "Jouji Ozu! Big<br/>brother. She took one last glance at him, The larger<br/>half-brother, at that.<p>She returned her steady gaze at the brains of the family,<br/>"I don't like the idea of intimidation."<p>Ozu got out of the car, "Then you must tell me, sometime,<br/>how you DO collect from customers that don't want to pay<br/>their gambling debts. You see, I did some research on<br/>your business, as well."<p>Nabiki Tendou said, "I give the best odds and easiest<br/>payments to the addicts."<p>Ozu smirked, "And that is the ONLY reason you're the only<br/>bookie in your neighborhood?" But he wasn't really<br/>interested in HER business, "Tell me, how you are going<br/>to make YOUR payment to me?"<p>Nabiki directed Ozu towards the plaza, "You mean the<br/>second installment? There are some designer gowns on a<br/>rack over here. They'd only go to waste, anyway. It's<br/>going to be hard enough to get Ranma out of what she<br/>wears now without getting her to go out to a formal<br/>event."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Tatewaki Kuno woke up with Nabiki Tendou kneeling beside<br/>him, wrapping him in bandages; "...You will...address me,<br/>as Lord Kuno..."<p>Nabiki said, "Sure thing, Kuno-baby. I'd have somebody<br/>who knew what they're doing look at your wounds." She did<br/>know there was no reason to wrap his arms and legs,<br/>Ranma's kicks had stayed on the samurai's mid-line; she<br/>just liked making him to look like a mummy.<p>Kuno mumbled, "The, the family herbalist...He can<br/>practically work, miracles."<p>Nabiki looked down on her work (and there HAD been more<br/>work to it than she was used to doing). She wondered if<br/>the herbalist would have to take the bandages off to<br/>treat him. Well, even if Kuno didn't show up at school<br/>looking this bad, she had the photos of him. She<br/>suppressed a girlish chuckle, At least I have photos<br/>that OUGHT to embarrass any normal guy.<p>But Kuno-sama would have to figure out for himself how he<br/>became completely wrapped yet was, now, in his kendo coat<br/>and hamaka pants. He sat up with, "Wh, where is Kei<br/>Tendou! Did, the cowardly bounder run!" He sounded as<br/>if he didn't remember it was the great Blue Thunder that<br/>had lost.<p>Nabiki thought, the blows to the head MAY have driven it<br/>out of the idiot's short-term memory. But, then again,<br/>Kuno-baby WAS an idiot. "That's right, Kuno. That's why<br/>you're covered head to foot in bandages." Nabiki was<br/>businesswoman enough not to tell a client anything he<br/>wasn't prepared to hear.<p>Kuno saw the bandages for the first time. "A lucky blow.<br/>No doubt, the churl got the worst of the engagement."<p>Nabiki said, "That's yet to be seen. (I wonder how many<br/>double entendres like that there will be.)"<p>Kuno asked, "Did you say something, Nabiki Tendou?"<p>Nabiki said, "Yes. I will deliver your gift to your "Pig-<br/>tailed Girl", Ranma Saotome."<p>Kuno got up to kneeling, but the action tightened the<br/>bandages before he could take Nabiki's hand. "You would<br/>do that! Even though it is unacceptable to an accepted<br/>member of your own family!" Meaning "Kei Tendou".<p>Nabiki told him, "I make no promises about the approval<br/>the girly clothes will get from Ranma."<p>Kuno nodded, thinking he understood, "Of course, the<br/>messenger is not the recipient. But at least I will know<br/>the message of my intentions will have been delivered."<br/>And he clenched his fist, "The intentions of that cad of<br/>a cousin of hers, Kei Tendou, are neither proper nor<br/>honorable! No doubt he will have Ranma's kin attempt to<br/>poison her mind against me!"<p>Nabiki told him, "Yes, no doubt the male side of Ranma<br/>will continue to resist your advances."<p>Kuno managed to rise to his feet; he said as a man with a<br/>vision, "But I know that once freed from her dependent<br/>status, Ranma Saotome will have no choice but to love<br/>me!"<p>Nabiki took her time rising, "Uh, hunh. What about AKANE<br/>Saotome? In the story I heard," from Mr. Saotome, "it<br/>looked as if she THREW herself at you, unprovoked.<br/>Doesn't that show her feelings for you are deeper than<br/>Ranma's?"<p>Kuno's vision shifted under his head-wrap, "Ah, yes: The<br/>Wild Haired Girl!"<p>Nabiki held up a hand, "Time out, Kuno-baby. The "Pig-<br/>tailed Girl" I can understand, but "Wild Haired Girl"?<br/>How did you come up with THAT nickname for her?"<p>Kuno looked at Akane's raven locks, "I use that<br/>appellation because her long tresses go unrestrained."<p>Nabiki nodded, "And without any hairspray, gel or mousse.<br/>Wild, it is. Okay, Kuno, resume play; justify your two-<br/>timing of Akane."<p>Kuno-sama said, "It is not two-timing when one's heart<br/>beats with equal force for each passion. I must go where<br/>my pure heart directs," he held his hands apart, "but<br/>since it can go neither right nor left, I must let THEM<br/>decide who shall win my noble heart."<p>Through deeply lowered eyelids, Nabiki asked, "You expect<br/>them to fight each other for YOU?"<p>The cursed Kuno raised his hands, "Of course not! I wish<br/>to see no harm come to their beauty; spiritual or<br/>physical." He stood as dignified as a mummy could, "The<br/>one who becomes my prize is the one who proves herself<br/>the MOST capable. Only a woman of truly blest can be<br/>joined with Takewaki Kuno as one."<p>Nabiki still had her eyelids lowered. "I think you're<br/>missing a connection in your logic, Kuno." As if that<br/>were new. Then she thought of something; she felt vaguely<br/>insulted, "Are you saying I wasn't capable enough for<br/>you?"<p>Kuno told her mater-of-factly, "Not at all, Nabiki<br/>Tendou. It was BECAUSE you are so capable that I first<br/>dated with you. But your talents, I came to realize, were<br/>not those best suited for a samurai."<p>Nabiki said, "Kuno, I have EXACTLY the talents a MODERN<br/>samurai needs. They are the rulers of the bureaucracy<br/>and... Oh, never mind! I, too, have come to realize I<br/>can put my talents to better use elsewhere.<p>"So, Kuno, what present shall you give Akane?"<p>Kuno looked back towards where he had last seen, "The<br/>doll." Then he looked away, "No, I cannot give Akane<br/>Saotome that when her cousin Ranma receives an expensive<br/>wardrobe. -Hold a while, Nabiki, and I will have you<br/>deliver a similar rack of feminine finery! At least THIS<br/>gift should meet with Kei Tendou's approval, the cur."<p>Nabiki held up her hand, "But not mine! My big sister,<br/>Kasumi, is happy dressing up her life-sized doll, Kuno-<br/>baby. You don't want me to disappoint the woman who's<br/>like a mother to me, now, do you? Right. So here's what I<br/>want you to do..."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi was back at home and back in her usual clothes.<br/>After doing some chores habit wouldn't let her put off,<br/>she was back upstairs in the hallway between the bedrooms<br/>and the guest room. It was time to think Feng Shui. "Oh,<br/>my. Well, the best place for the omamori, I suppose,<br/>would be halfway between Akane's and Ranma's rooms." She<br/>nodded, satisfied with the solution. "That would be a<br/>place where neither owned anything, and that would show<br/>no favoritism.<p>She smiled, "And that would be MY room! How very<br/>convenient." Her smile slipped as she realized, "Oh, my!<br/>Kaneda's tool chest! That's in my closet...but it IS on<br/>Ranma's side. No, to be fair, I will have to find<br/>something of Ranma's too keep in my room. I DO like the<br/>idea of selecting the perfect outfits for my new sister.<br/>She has yet no idea what a proper young lady should<br/>wear."<p>She turned to gaze at the guest room. "Now, what can I<br/>possibly get from Ranma that'll balance things out? It<br/>SHOULD be something magic."<p>Nabiki had just come up the stairs, "Just think in terms<br/>of voodoo."<p>Kasumi gave a small, startled cry, "Oh, my! I couldn't<br/>use voodoo on a guest."<p>Nabiki let pass the implication of who Oneesan would use<br/>voodoo on, "If you're concerned about some magical bad<br/>luck because of some Oriental idea of imbalance, just get<br/>a lock of Ranma's hair." She assumed that was why Kasumi<br/>was interested in getting something of Ranma's. Nabiki<br/>seldom tried to figure Oneesan out. They just didn't<br/>think the same.<p>Kasumi asked, "Ranma's hair?"<p>Nabiki walked towards her, "I assume it remains connected<br/>to Ranma. At least that's the way magic is supposed to<br/>work, isn't it? If IT changes colors, then the magic is<br/>still there."<p>Kasumi smiled, "That sounds logical!" Then she noticed<br/>what her little sister was carrying, "Nabiki! What a<br/>cute, little doll! Is that yours?"<p>Nabiki looked at the blue-eyed, blond doll in the long<br/>pink dress, "Of course not: I am WAY beyond playing with<br/>dolls. I talked Kuno into letting me have it. I don't<br/>think it's worth much, but every little yen helps."<p>Kasumi was confused, "Kuno, the samurai boy who Kaneda<br/>practices his martial arts skills with? What was he doing<br/>with a dolly?"<p>Nabiki said, "He was going to give it to either Ranma or<br/>Akane. I talked him out of giving it to them."<p>Kasumi became excited, "Oh, my! Something that belongs to<br/>both, and neither! And it's so adorable it HAS to be full<br/>of Yin! Nabiki, may I have it?"<p>Nabiki looked from her 'big' sister to the little doll.<br/>She sighed, then tossed her the little girl's thing,<br/>"Sure, why not!" When Kasumi caught it, Nabiki said to<br/>her, "But you've got to help get Ranma and Akane out of<br/>the house. I have some things hidden that I don't want<br/>them to see me taking up into my room." She smiled,<br/>"They're ALSO something from Kuno-baby."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Out the Tendou open garden door, sunset could be seen<br/>coming.<p>Still angry, Ranma-kun threw his bookbag down on the<br/>floor of the Tendou family room. He wasn't thinking about<br/>the homework he'd neglected for four days, now: "Stupid<br/>girl!" He plopped down on one of the cushions around the<br/>table, "HMH!" Somebody, the oldest sister, no doubt, had<br/>left snacks to help him keep to his work area. He grabbed<br/>the bag of potato chips, and shoved them in his mouth.<p>In the middle of the fourth handful, he had spit what was<br/>still in his mouth out. "Plah!" He picked up the teapot<br/>by his side, and guzzled the tea inside from the spout.<p>Several gulps later, he picked up the bag and threw it at<br/>the far wall in disgust! "HER problem is she doesn't know<br/>SHE'S supposed to be a girl! That's how STUPID she is!<br/>Girls are supposed to be soft and giving, and not come<br/>AFTER you! Homes where MADE for them, for crying out<br/>loud!"<p>He slammed his fists down on the table, "And cute: Girls<br/>are SUPPOSED to be cute! There's nothing CUTE about a<br/>girl that can become a guy!"<p>"But remind her, and she does things to you that no REAL<br/>girl would do to a guy!"<p>He rose to his feet, "Okay, then! If she won't ACT like a<br/>girl, I should just treat her like she WASN'T! Let's see<br/>how much she likes being a guy, when she has to take the<br/>lumps that go with it!"<p>Holding onto that thought firmly in his mind, he strode<br/>out of the Tendou family room (and away from his<br/>homework).<p>Ranma-kun almost bumped into his pop just outside in the<br/>hallway. The Old Man smiled at his son, "I KNEW you would<br/>finally come to your senses, boy! After all, you DON'T<br/>want to give others the impression you have a<br/>relationship with guy, now do you!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Before Genma Saotome could react fast enough, he found<br/>himself flying. Or Genma wished he could fly: Ranma had<br/>thrown him towards the Tendou's koi pond again.<p>Splash!<p>Ranma screamed at the dumb black-and-white creature,<br/>"Thanks for reminding me why I CAN'T treat her as a guy!<br/>It's bad enough bein' stuck to a girl who wants to be the<br/>guy! Treatin' her like one would be like admittin' I WAS<br/>in a relationship with a guy!"<p>The panda growled in frustration, too. It could do<br/>nothing but watch its son stomp away.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Meanwhile, Kaneda was in his kempo-gi in the family dojo.<br/>Something was happening that hadn't happened much since<br/>he'd started getting boobs and a figure: His dad was<br/>working out with him.<p>His dad said during the sparing, "...I'm just asking you<br/>to meet Akane, Kaneda." He had thrown a blow aimed at<br/>Kaneda's stomach.<p>Kaneda was NOT happy that Akane was the reason his dad<br/>was practicing with him, "I don't think you'll ever see<br/>us together." Kaneda tried to knock his dad's legs out<br/>from under him.<p>Soun Tendou protested, "Don't be like that, Kaneda! I'm<br/>asking you as my son. It's your filial duty to just get<br/>to know her! I am SURE you have things in common." He was<br/>giving Kaneda a series of left/right karate fist jabs.<p>Kaneda said, "Oh! I've no doubt about that. But you know<br/>what they say, Dad, "Opposites attract, sames repel".<br/>There is nobody more "same" than Akane and me." Kaneda<br/>had gone on the offense with some chops.<p>Soun Tendou cried in frustration, "How do you KNOW that<br/>until you meet her!" He drove the heel his hand for his<br/>son's forehead.<p>Kaneda screamed, "I KNOW! The same way I know RANMA'S<br/>the girl for me!" Kaneda kicked for his dad's gut.<p>Soun Tendou raised his voice, "But Ranma's really a young<br/>man!" He grabbed Kaneda's leg.<p>Kaneda yanked his leg free, "And YOU'RE the expert on<br/>who's a guy!" He spun around-His instep hit the man<br/>squarely in the side of the face.<p>Soun Tendou went rigid and fell. Then he just lay there<br/>like a statue that had toppled over, still in its pose.<p>Kaneda realized what he'd done: "Oh, no! Dad, I'm<br/>sorry!" But his dad wasn't in any condition to forgive<br/>him. Kaneda called, "Kasumi! Kasumi! Come quick!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda had lifted his dad and was carrying him into the<br/>house when Kasumi finally heard her little brother.<br/>"Kaneda! I don't think it's a good idea to move an<br/>injured person."<p>Kaneda told her, "You're not supposed to hit a person<br/>across the face until they wake up, either, but that's<br/>what the Anything-Goes School teaches, too."<p>Kasumi gave up, "Fine! Take Father into the living room,<br/>and I'll get a cushion and blanket for Father."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>After Kaneda had returned from the kitchen with an ice<br/>pack, Kasumi had done all the first aid she could do for<br/>their father. Kaneda was glad to see that his dad was at<br/>least showing signs that he was just asleep.<p>The two children of Soun Tendou knelt on the mat floor<br/>beside him, waiting until he could tell them how hurt he<br/>was.<p>Kasumi turned around to confront Kaneda. She clasped his<br/>hand between hers and brought it up. Kaneda asked,<br/>"What?"<p>Kasumi gave her a steady look into his eyes. She spoke<br/>with a seriousness Kaneda was not used to hearing from<br/>his Oneesan. "Kaneda, I want you to listen to me as if I<br/>were our poor, dear, departed mother, alright?"<p>Kaneda gasped, "Hunh!" This was an occasion of utmost<br/>seriousness. Kasumi did not ask them to identify her with<br/>mom lightly, even though that was what THEY all did.<p>Kasumi told her, "Listen, Kaneda, I want you to promise<br/>me you'll never strike somebody in anger again."<p>Kaneda just stared at Oneesan. What could he say?<p>Kasumi demanded an answer, "Kaneda?"<p>Kaneda answered, "Yeah, but..."<p>Kasumi let go of his hand, and became even more serious,<br/>"Promise, Kaneda!" She was even frowning!<p>Kaneda surrendered, "Okay." He looked away. He saw the<br/>open eyes of their father. For all his resentment of the<br/>way Dad had treated him, he did not hate him. Kaneda did<br/>love him as much as a son could love a father.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan protested, "But shopping is for girls!"<p>Kasumi told her, "That's why you're a girl, now. Besides<br/>not embarrassing you, it won't bring attention to you."<p>Kane-chan said sourly, "Except that I'll be a girl nobody<br/>knows."<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, they are a few that remember the<br/>mystery girl of the neighborhood. If anybody asks, you<br/>just tell them you're name is Akane Saotome."<p>'Akane' asked, "And if they ASK why I never introduced<br/>myself in 16 years?"<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my. Well, if you can't think of a<br/>reason, we'll just have to ask Nabiki for one. I'm not<br/>very good at coming up with stories."<p>Kane-chan said, "Never mind! She's the reason there is an<br/>'Akane' and there ISN'T a mystery girl, any more."<p>As Kane-chan went out the front door, Oneesan called out,<br/>"Remember, bring me back some ground pork and white<br/>onions, alright?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>It was a beautiful sunset out. But Kane-chan wasn't<br/>enjoying it. She was back in the pink jumper and white<br/>blouse. (And lingerie. Akane had a hard time ever<br/>forgetting when she was wearing panties and a bra.) Is<br/>Kasumi trying to punish me for what I did to Dad? She<br/>shook her head. No, that's not like her. It's probably<br/>her idea of getting me to be a girl more. She couldn't<br/>get angry at her Oneesan, so she became grumpy, So when<br/>is it going to be RANMA'S turn at being a girled-up<br/>girl! This is NOT playing fair! When is SHE going to be<br/>the tortoise!<p>She realized she WAS feeling out of sorts. She hoped it<br/>was JUST everything that had happened to her the past<br/>five days catching up with her. "But I promised Kasumi I<br/>would try and control my emotions."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan's dad and the panda were sitting cross-legged<br/>on the garden hall. They weren't enjoying the beautiful<br/>sunset, either. Soun said, "We've got to think of<br/>something. My son, Kaneda, stubbornly refuses to see that<br/>your Ranma is not really a girl. But, then, so apparently<br/>does Akane." He shook THAT thought about the girl he<br/>wanted to be his daughter-in-law out of his head. He had<br/>to think constructively, "If we can just get Kaneda and<br/>Akane to think of each other, and not Ranma, our problems<br/>would be solved."<p>The panda nodded, "Mmrr-hmmr." Soun did not want to know<br/>the truth about Kaneda and Akane, but together, they<br/>MIGHT come up with a solution. And getting Kaneda more<br/>concerned about 'Akane' than Ranma seemed a good start.<p>Kasumi came down the hall with the teakettle, "Father,<br/>here's the hot water."<p>As Soun poured the water on the panda, he said, "We have<br/>to do something."<p>Genma nodded, "Hmm, you're right! We have to do<br/>something."<p>And the something they did at the moment was sit with<br/>their arms crossed, trying to come up with a plan of<br/>attack.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan was on the bridge over the river now. Ranma had<br/>already become associated in her head with the fence.<br/>Girl or guy, Ranma could walk the narrow railing as<br/>casually as if it were the ground.<p>{The Ranma-kun-of-memory had said, "Just remember we're<br/>strangers. I don't want you hangin' around me at school,<br/>you understand?<p>{Kaneda-of-memory had said, "The whole school's going to<br/>know you're living with me."<p>{Ranma-kun had cried, "Stop sayin' things like that, even<br/>as a girl!"<p>{Kaneda had continued anyway, "You know we're in no<br/>position to choose who we're going to marry."}<p>Kane-chan bowed her head, Are we cursed in more than<br/>just our bodies? I was hoping two curses together would<br/>cancel them out. Since we both don't want to be freaks,<br/>we could HELP each other be normal.<p>Ranma-kun said, "Stupid girl."<p>Kane-chan looked up at the real Ranma-kun on the fence<br/>going in the opposite direction. She reacted as if he had<br/>heard what she had only been thinking. "I'm not stupid,<br/>and I'm not...going to get angry! " She almost told him<br/>she wasn't a girl. That was the one advantage she had<br/>over Ranma in a fair fight. It was Ranma's weak spot. She<br/>fought back her pride as a man with Remember, this is<br/>the School of ANYTHING-Goes. Winning is what's<br/>important!<p>Ranma-kun hadn't been following her; had SHE come after<br/>him? He challenged, "So: Where'd you come from?"<p>Kane-chan answered, "You tell me!"<p>Ranma answered back, "HNH!"<p>Kane-chan responded, "HHNH!" and continued the way she'd<br/>been going. There was something about this guy that<br/>really bugged her! Maybe it WAS because he was a guy,<br/>now, not a girl. That nearly made him a different person<br/>from the girl she had a crush on.<p>Right now, Ranma HAD the girl that pushed just about all<br/>of his buttons but sexual walking away from him. "Keep<br/>followin' me around, and maybe some of my cuteness will<br/>rub off on you. Then I MIGHT begin to take this<br/>engagement thing seriously."<p>Kane-chan leaped up onto the fence railing. It took more<br/>effort than it took Ranma to stay balanced; but she was<br/>NOT about to fall into the river in front of this jerk:<br/>"Ranma, if you don't shut your mouth right now, I'll-"<br/>She stopped herself. "Oh?"<p>She lowered her fist, slowly. Letting it go to her hip,<br/>she tried exhaling her anger. "Hnh!" She then told<br/>herself as much as Ranma, "I promised my sister Kasumi<br/>that I'd NEVER hit anybody in anger again."<p>Ranma-kun didn't buy that, "Hunh!" He jumped down to the<br/>bridge's pavement. Now it was HIS turn to walk away.<p>But that wasn't victory enough for Ranma. After a few<br/>paces, he stopped to look over his shoulder. He smirked,<br/>"NOW you're startin' to think like a girl. You just need<br/>to start actin' like one. Ha! Even a tomboy'd be a major<br/>improvement. Right now you're just plain butch." By the<br/>luck of destiny, Ranma had met very few female martial<br/>artists. None of them were HIS idea of what a girl should<br/>be. (And ONE in particular.)<p>As he walked away for real this time, Kane-chan growled,<br/>"Did he just...Hrrrnh! I can't believe he said that! My<br/>MOTHER was a-" She nodded, "Mm, Hm!" and jumped down off<br/>the railing.<p>Kane-chan cried, "Wait a minute!"<p>Ranma-kun turned, "Hn? Wha-?"<p>Kane-chan was running full force at him, "Who are YOU to<br/>be calling anybody butch! What's the OTHER words that<br/>go with that one, you stupid pervert!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan beat Ranma-kun up pretty badly. So badly, she<br/>had to drag the larger, heavier teen draped over her<br/>shoulder. She ended up aggravating the damage even more.<p>Dr. Tofu's clinic was only a block away, but she had to<br/>lay the guy down when she got inside the gate. While she<br/>was catching her breath, her eyes fell on the garden<br/>hose.<p>Kane-chan said to herself, "That's right, Dr. Tofu<br/>doesn't know that Ranma changes, too."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The mangled Ranma-chan was laid more gently on the clinic<br/>bed than her male counterpart would have been. The wet,<br/>chilled girl still hurt.<p>Dr. Tofu studied the injured teen; "Hmmm... This is<br/>dreadful: The bruises! The severe dislocation of the<br/>joints!" He looked at Kane-chan and asked, "WHO did this<br/>to her?"<p>Kane-chan had remained in her girl-form BECAUSE she was<br/>afraid of what her coach would think if he thought<br/>Kaneda-KUN had beat up a girl. Still, the reaction of the<br/>man Kane-chan respected most seemed harsh to her, "Well,<br/>I, uh..."<p>An awkward silence followed.<p>It was filled by the snap, crackle, pop of Ranma-chan<br/>trying, and failing, to sit up in bed. "Rnh! Rn!<br/>Rernhunh!" She managed to get out, "S, s, stupid, gir,<br/>girl did this...to me! Re, real butch, type!"<p>Ranma-chan suddenly fell head first out of the bed when<br/>Kane-chan jerked the foot of the bed up: "What did I tell<br/>you about calling the pan black!"<p>Dr. Tofu looked at Kane-chan for the moment it took for<br/>it to sink in. "You did this, "Shinpiko"?" The family<br/>doctor purposely used the nickname he used to protect<br/>Kaneda's secret.<p>Feeling guilty, feeling the loss of respect from the good<br/>doctor, Kane-chan dropped the bed end. She took a step<br/>back; "Um...well, she..."<p>Upside down, and looking even more like a pretzel, now,<br/>Ranma-chan looked up from the floor at Kane-chan, Hnh!<br/>"Shinpiko": "Mystery Kid"! The only "mystery" is how she<br/>thinks a butch-type like her can pull off the "Sweet-and-<br/>Innocent" act!<p>Dr, Tofu slapped his thigh, "Ah, ha! I knew it! I knew<br/>that damage looked kind of unique!" And he laughed long<br/>and hard.<p>Kane-chan stared at his reaction. Is he, trying to make<br/>me FEEL better?<p>Ranma-chan wasn't feeling better, Oh, "Ha, Ha"! Yuck it<br/>up, why don'chya!<p>The man picked the small Ranma-chan up and sat her on top<br/>of the bed, "Up you go!" He then demonstrated his<br/>expertise, "Look at the way this joint is twisted<br/>backwards: That's Shinpiko's touch, no doubt" To Ranma-<br/>chan's screams, he then shoved on Ranma-chan's shoulder<br/>while pulling her arm straight out. And the fiend<br/>laughed!<p>The man then pushed the redhead's D cup chest down onto<br/>the bed, where he proceeded to jab and grapple her,<br/>"You're Ranma Saotome, right? I'm generally pretty good<br/>with names. We met last Thursday." Ranma-chan was in too<br/>much pain to answer with anything but noises. The man<br/>said, "You're staying with the Tendous, I hear. I take it<br/>you've MET Shinpiko." He laughed at that last one.<p>"Shinpiko" had to say, "Ranma knows my secret, Dr. Tofu."<p>The Doctor said smiling from the full Nelson he had<br/>Ranma-chan in, "Then the Neighborhood Grapevine is true!<br/>Not that I pay too close attention to rumors. But I WAS<br/>afraid I'd have to tie a knot in that one, too. You know,<br/>to protect "Shinpiko"."<p>"Shinpiko" wasn't ready to tell him that she had a name<br/>now; that might lead to...OTHER questions. Dr. Tofu HAS<br/>to know about Akane and Kei, by now. He's just too polite<br/>to ask a question somebody's not ready to tell. "Yes,<br/>Ranma's dad and my dad are old friends, and arranged<br/>things. Kasumi didn't tell you any of this?"<p>Snapping Ranma-chan's neck, Dr. Tofu answered, "Kasumi?<br/>Why no, I don't remember her saying anything." He laughed<br/>half-dreamily, "I hardly remember anything Kasumi says to<br/>me."<p>"Shinpiko" thought: Oh, no! I hope I didn't make a<br/>mistake by bringing Kasumi up while the doctor's<br/>working!<p>Ranma-chan at last got free from the man's evil clutches.<br/>She yelled in the man's face: "That HURT, you know!"<p>The Doctor put his face closer, "It does? Tell me where<br/>it hurts."<p>Ranma-chan felt her shoulder, her side...just about every<br/>part of her torso but her boobs'. "Hunh? Hmmh? -Hey!<br/>It's okay now! I'm cured! Even the stupid, invisible<br/>corset is gone!"<p>The Doctor asked, "You wanted it removed, didn't you? I<br/>could put it back for you."<p>Ranma-chan held up her hands, "No! I don't EVER want to<br/>wear a corset again!" Then she turned a smug eye to Kane-<br/>chan, "So much for winnin' a contest over me!"<p>Dr. Tofu rose to his feet, "Oh? Shinpiko, YOU'RE the<br/>reason for the corset?"<p>Kane-chan told him, "I WON the contest fair and square!<br/>The goddess Benten was the referee!" To Ranma-chan, she<br/>told, "Just because you don't HAVE it on you any more,<br/>DOESN'T mean I didn't win!"<p>Dr. Tofu thought he understood, "I see. You've been to<br/>the Temple of the Nine Abilities, then?"<p>Kane-chan told him, "It was to get a blessing for the<br/>engagement."<p>Ranma-chan told Kane-chan, "And there IS no blessing,<br/>'cause I refuse to admit I was beaten! I'll drop you in<br/>a second, the second I'm convinced Kasumi or somebody<br/>else is the right one for me!"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Kasumi's involved in this!"<p>Kane-chan slapped her forehead. The cats were out of the<br/>bag: Both of them!<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Nabiki held her jaw with in one hand, its elbow on the<br/>family table, "And what is this?"<p>Kasumi was kneeling on the other side, her elbows on the<br/>table, her chin on the backs of her hands, "It's boiled<br/>potatoes, Nabiki."<p>Nabiki said, "I thought we were going to have MEAT and<br/>potatoes tonight, Kasumi."<p>Kasumi informed her, "I thought so, too. But the person I<br/>asked to by the meat and onions hasn't come back from the<br/>market, yet."<p>Nabiki said, "That's how you got them out of the house?<br/>You should know better than to send boy-brains to do the<br/>shopping."<p>The phone rang.<p>Kasumi got up to answer it. On the way she said, "Mr.<br/>Saotome, Father, it looks like it's supper time, after<br/>all."<p>Her father asked his Old Comrade, "Have you thought of<br/>anything? Anything, at all?"<p>Genma Saotome answered, "Not yet. What about you?"<p>Soun Tendou set the teakettle in his lap aside. He picked<br/>up a pail, and threw the water. "Well! What about now?<br/>Any ideas?"<p>The panda reacted angrily, "Bwaorrr!" taking a swipe at<br/>the overly handsome man with its claws.<p>The man confident in his own looks chuckled, "Heh, Hey,<br/>calm down! I just thought being a panda might help you<br/>concentrate, that's all!" His laugh was forced.<p>And the panda did NOT see the joke.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan bowed as she left the clinic, "Good night!" The<br/>Doctor WAS her coach, as well as a trusted friend of the<br/>family. He had earned her respect many times over.<p>Dr. Tofu said, "Good night, "Shinpiko"!"<p>As Ranma-chan was leaving, Dr. Tofu said to her, "Uh,<br/>Ranma! Just a moment!" Ranma-chan stopped out on the one<br/>step porch. Dr. Tofu said to her, "I AM a man who lives<br/>his life by the Hippocratic Oath of "Do no harm". If it<br/>is for the best, you are free to marry whomever will<br/>accept your proposal." A might too hard, the good doctor<br/>pushed Ranma-chan in the back and on his way.<p>As Ranma-chan stood on the walkway, still looking back at<br/>the man, Dr. Tofu said, "I shall pay a visit the temple.<br/>In the meantime, why don't you just try getting to know<br/>Shinpiko. Kaneda's really a very considerate and friendly<br/>person."<p>Ranma-chan told the stranger, "If you think THAT, you<br/>don't know her as well as you-"<p>Suddenly Ranma-chan got a big grimace that showed all of<br/>her teeth. She put her hands around on her lumbar region<br/>of her back as her waist and belly became pinched, "The<br/>damn corset is back!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi entered the family room again. Nabiki had gotten<br/>tired of waiting for the Elders, and had started on one<br/>of the small, boiled potatoes. "Nabiki, that was a young<br/>man named Ozu. He asked me to give you a message. It's<br/>just one word: "Checkmate"?"<p>Nabiki got a big wide grin on her face, "And just in time<br/>for school tomorrow!" She glanced at the Two Fathers, and<br/>said in a lowered voice, "Kasumi, do you know what<br/>"checkmate" can mean in English?" She chuckled, "Ranma<br/>will NEVER be our fiance."<p>The End of this chapter
