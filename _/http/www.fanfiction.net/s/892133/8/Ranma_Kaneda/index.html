</div>Ranma &amp; Kaneda<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>From an idea by James M. Zema,<br/>Unauthorized, but allowed.<p>08: A Sight Best Not Beheld<p>Dogs were barking nearby. It was a cool late afternoon,<br/>and Kane-chan was out walking in a very pink jumper,<br/>white blouse, calf-high stocks and black ballet slippers.<br/>She was also wearing a bra and panties. This was<br/>something she was SURE everybody was aware of. Wearing<br/>lingerie was still new to her. In public, anyway. (There<br/>were the three times SHE (not HE) had tried on her<br/>sisters'-Just to get an idea what girls had to put up<br/>with! And she didn't even want to THINK about what almost<br/>became her fourth time!)<p>And everybody's going to be more aware if I fiddle with<br/>this damned bra! The thing never quite lands where it<br/>should be. The other things don't make that much trouble<br/>when they poof onto me.<p>She looked around for the solution to her problem; water.<br/>They were headed away from the local business district<br/>and towards her home. The black haired guy in Chinese<br/>clothes and a bookbag on his back was walking the walls<br/>ahead of her. Ranma-kun was ignoring her ...Or maybe he<br/>was thinking about how simple it was to turn HER into the<br/>girl!<p>When Ranma said that hot water turns her into a guy, I<br/>thought that was the same kind of hot water that turns me<br/>into a girl! Ranma DID say we have the same curse. So WHY<br/>is steaming tap water's enough to take away my<br/>manhood!<p>Ranma was lucky. It took real hot water to take away her<br/>favored form. If it weren't for Saotome's brainwashing,<br/>Ranma'd realize how easy it was to stay a girl most of<br/>the time.<p>But, no: To stay in the Saotome family and under her<br/>father's control, Ranma has to be the husband. If her no<br/>good father does allow me to marry Ranma, it'll be as<br/>(shudder) the wife. And to make me his wife, all he has<br/>to do is go to the nearest sink!" She thought<br/>sarcastically, "That's where you find wives, isn't?<p>Kane-chan told herself, "I have to take his mind off of<br/>that, quickly! She might forget, then!"<p>Ranma-kun's sense of danger was slow to react, " ' You<br/>say something?" When he turned around, he saw Kane-chan<br/>launching her attack:<p>"Ha-yiii!"<p>He did a little side hop and stood there watching her<br/>holding onto the top of the wall. She was trying to<br/>scramble up. "You DON'T look very lady-like, you know."<p>The edge of the wall gouged into Kane-chan as her boobs<br/>oozed past it (but leaving behind the bra)...until only<br/>her hands were on top.<p>The only purchase Kane-chan could get on the cement<br/>surface was not from her stupid slippers, but her bare<br/>knees. "Shut up!"<p>Ranma-kun squatted down closer, "You'd have more of a<br/>height advantage if you were a-"<p>Kane-chan told him, "No, I don't need it!" Her boobs<br/>were pressed up against the wall; and one was leg exposed<br/>even more by its foot raised almost to the top of the<br/>wall. That's it: Keep thinking about me becoming a guy:<br/>NOT a girl! "I'd still not have your school's lower body<br/>skills!"<p>She let herself drop to the ground. "But I do have the<br/>TENDOU School's skills!" Not thinking to straighten her<br/>skirt (but wishing she COULD adjust the bra), she looked<br/>around. There, across the street!<p>Ranma casually watched her run over to another wall. He<br/>said, "I've noticed. We have basically the same style of<br/>fighting. But we do emphasize different things."<p>Kane-chan picked up the push broom somebody had left by<br/>their gate. "Well, our schools DO begin with kempo."<p>As she hurried back across the street with the broom with<br/>the long, scrub-brush-like head, Ranma-kun said, "And our<br/>fathers once studied together. But your style relies too<br/>much on weapons." Large wooden mallets came particularly<br/>to mind.<p>Kane-chan place one end of the long broom head over the<br/>top of the next wall in front of Ranma-kun, "Tools!<br/>Weapons make it sound we like to go on the offense."<br/>Holding tightly onto the handle, she said, "And this tool<br/>is going to compensate for the skills I haven't developed<br/>yet-Which is what tools do!" And she started scaling the<br/>walls.<p>Ranma-kun looked at her unconvinced and unimpressed,<br/>"You'd have more muscle mass if you were a-"<p>With her feet almost at the top of the wall, Kane-chan<br/>screamed, "Tools are like martial arts techniques! If<br/>you have the right one, it doesn't matter what size-"<p>The handle popped free of the broom head. The broom head<br/>fell!<p>Ranma-kun continued to look on, "What were you saying<br/>about "the right" tool?"<p>The back of Kane-chan's heels was the only part of her<br/>(barely) on top of the wall; she was using all of her<br/>girlish strength to keep herself up by the handle. Her<br/>long, black hair touched the pavement, as well as the hem<br/>of her skirt.<p>Ranma-kun commented, "You know, blue polka dot panties<br/>really don't suit you."<p>Reddening, Kane-chan wanted to scream! No! The idea<br/>was for him to Not to like seeing me as a girl!<p>Her battle aura burning, she spit out her skirt and<br/>yelled, "Tendou Upper Body Whip Crack!" The muscles<br/>lower in her torso, now upside down, fed their power to<br/>those higher, and those to the next set of muscles-Until<br/>her concentrated strength was rolled into her arms: And<br/>into a great shove on the broom handle!<p>Kane-chan did a dangling pole vault over onto her heels!<p>Over onto the wall! Where she teetered for a moment, her<br/>arms spinning. "Whoa-Oh-Oh-Uh, oh!"<p>She fell belly down without the handle onto the yard on<br/>the other side.<p>Ranma-kun stood up on the wall, "What a klutz!" He jogged<br/>over to the next wall, "Are you okay?"<p>Over the yipping and yapping of the yard's dog, Kane-chan<br/>called out, "Help me! Help me, I'm being attacked!"<p>Ranma-kun just looked at the girl through half-lidded<br/>eyes. "It's just a puppy." The St. Bernard that was twice<br/>the size of her hands was next to her face, licking it<br/>ferociously.<p>Kane-chan kept calling, "Save me from it! Quick before<br/>it's mother finds me! Help!"<p>Ranma-kun was about to walk away on the wall, when he<br/>thought of something. "Do you have a phobia?"<p>Kane-chan kept pleading for help.<p>Sighing, Ranma jumped down into the yard. Kane-chan was<br/>rolling around on her back, her skirt up near the top of<br/>her thighs (and her boobs completely out of the bra).<p>When he reached for the little fur ball, Kane-chan shoved<br/>the puppy up into his face. Ranma got slobbered!<p>Ranma-kun took the creature away from Kane-chan and his<br/>face. "What'd you do that for!"<p>Her own face even more covered with drool, Kane-chan made<br/>to sit up, "Nothing. I was just—Ow-ch, ch!" She hadn't<br/>faked the fall.<p>Ranma-kun stood up, "If you were testin' to see if water<br/>from livin' things can change me, it can't. I spent two<br/>weeks with the curse fightin' with Pop over food. If all<br/>the spit he puts out can't change me, nothing else's<br/>will."<p>Wincing at the pain, Kane-chan thought, There goes that<br/>idea. He was wrong about how hot ordinary water has to<br/>be. If he had been wrong about living water, too, I could<br/>have returned Ranma to a girl again just by kissing and<br/>licking.<p>Wincing at the thought, Kane-chan shuddered, Kissing and<br/>licking a guy! Maybe I couldn't have.<p>Then she got a WORSE thought: What if Ranma changed into<br/>this guy while we were getting hot and sweaty!<p>"Meow."<p>*Vooss*<p>Kane-chan caught the puppy as Ranma went sailing over the<br/>wall.<p>Kane-chan frowned, "Oh, great! I thought making Ranma mad<br/>was like challenging her! It would keep her around so she<br/>could "win" the argument." Kane-chan set the puppy down<br/>next to the kitten that had come to check things out.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan had to move carefully. She had landed on her<br/>front. And that meant her boobs got the worst of it. They<br/>would soon be terribly bruised. A good reason not to put<br/>the bra back over them.<p>But she was martial artist enough to ignore most of the<br/>pain.<p>The yard didn't have a koi pond, but it did have a<br/>birdbath. Kane-chan looked at it. "That's almost as<br/>unsanitary than dog slobber."<p>But, being a guy at heart, she used it.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The red haired Kaneda was back to wearing his Furinkan<br/>High gray slacks, and white shirt, but black cross-<br/>trainers. It feels good to be in loose boxers and not<br/>tight panties.<p>He used his martial arts stealth skills to sneak out the<br/>front gate. Deep in thought, he made his way for home on<br/>a different street than he usually took. I wasn't wrong<br/>about how to keep Ranma interested, was I? That HAS to<br/>be the first step in any plan to get her to become my<br/>wife. I mean, a shotgun wedding's not going to work with<br/>HER. There was a double meaning with his last sentence.<br/>No, I didn't mean it that way! Geez! I wouldn't survive<br/>the wedding, let alone the honeymoon.<p>Suddenly the house behind him had a disturbance with a<br/>lot of running and yelling: "An intruder!"/ "In a<br/>disguise!"/ "What a stupid disguise!"/ "Go get<br/>grandfather!"/ "No, I can use the kusari-fundo!"/<br/>"Young man, I don't want you getting yourself hurt with<br/>that old weight-and-scythe pike!"/ "You just don't want<br/>me to become a ninja like Granddaddy!".../<p>Kaneda said, "Yes! Here's a chance to be a martial..."<p>Jumping from a tree behind the wall, something black-and-<br/>white hopped onto the top of the wall and then onto the<br/>street.<p>Kaneda said, "Then, maybe not."<p>Too busy looking over its shoulder, the panda in the<br/>redlined black cape, white tie, black tuxedo with tails,<br/>and top hat was didn't see Kaneda.<p>Kaneda stretched out a leg.<p>As it fell, its leaflets flew.<p>With it down on the ground, Kaneda could read the sign<br/>pinned on back of the coat, [Usagi's Tuxedo and Mask<br/>Shop, Costumes for Every Occasion]. I guess a panda<br/>already comes with a mask.<p>Looking down, Kaneda asked, "What's the idea, Mr.<br/>Saotome?"<p>Still face down, the panda held up a sign, [I'm not Genma<br/>Saotome.]<p>Kaneda said, "Yeah, right."<p>The panda lifted itself up onto its rear, [I'm a shill in<br/>a black-and-white costume!]<p>Kaneda said, "That's some costume. I can't even see the<br/>zipper."<p>The panda scooted its bulk away. [Don't touch! Any<br/>damages come out of my fee.]<p>"Fee?" Kaneda had a different opinion of his houseguest,<br/>now. "I didn't know you were already working. I'm sorry,<br/>Giri no Chichi Mirai."<p>The panda leaped to its feet, [WHO are you calling Future<br/>Father-in-law!]<p>It looked like Kaneda would have to fight the 118-kg/300<br/>lb. animal, after all.<p>But the fight was interrupted by thin but tall old man in<br/>a brown kimono and getas clopping towards them; spinning<br/>a 3 meter-long chain with an iron weight on the end of<br/>it. In his other hand, its middle attached to the other<br/>end of the chain, was a pike over 3 meters long with a<br/>straightedge scythe on the other end. "I'll skin the<br/>beast as a memento! The family will pass it down through<br/>the generations! They remember the time when the<br/>"Watanabe School of Togakure Ninjutsu" lived again!"<p>Somehow the black-and-white panda turned pale and fled.<p>Mr. Watanabe's weight didn't have the chance to either<br/>hit or wrap itself around the panda. Kaneda stopped it.<br/>He let it wrap itself around his arm, where he caught the<br/>weight in his hand.<p>Mr. Watanabe cried, "Who are you to interfere with a<br/>ninja protecting his pledged family from an invader!<br/>Are you responsible for that creature!"<p>Kaneda said, "Grandfather," and bowed. But he made sure<br/>to keep an eye on the weapon. The kami yari was level.<br/>The strange man could decide to stab him with the point<br/>or slash him with the blade.<p>The old man decided, instead, to pull at the chain still<br/>wrapped around Kaneda's hand. "I may be a grandfather,<br/>but I'm not so old I can't kill a bear!"<p>Bowing lower, Kaneda picked up one of the strewn<br/>leaflets, "As you can see, Grandfather, he wasn't an<br/>invader. He was just distributing ads." He showed it to<br/>the man with his free hand. "It's a costume shop. It you<br/>want a panda skin, I'm sure you can get one cheap there."<p>The old, weathered man looked at the leaflet with obvious<br/>disappointment. He salvaged his face with, "The lackey of<br/>merchants shouldn't invade other people's property! Why<br/>do you think we all have privacy walls!"<p>Kaneda let go of the weight and shook the chain off, "I<br/>know. There's a reason he looks like a dumb animal. But<br/>look at it this way, he doesn't put up any of the<br/>leaflets up on those walls. You know how strict Nerima is<br/>about posting." It was true. The Greater Nerima area had<br/>the barest walls and poles to be seen. There was even a<br/>story of a local gaki ghost that does something terrible<br/>to people that put things on concrete.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kaneda was walking to his own front door when he heard<br/>Ranma-kun yell from the garden: "Put some pants on, Pop!<br/>All you've got on is a stupid tux coat!"<p>Kaneda went off the path, and headed around towards the<br/>garden.<p>Future Father-in-law said, "You shouldn't have used that<br/>teakettle on me! It's not my fault I can't change my<br/>clothes, too!"<p>Kaneda's eyes opened wider at this news.<p>Ranma-kun said, "At least be a panda! Nobody cares if a<br/>panda's naked!"<p>Splash!<p>Poking his head at last around the corner, Kaneda was in<br/>time to see a tuxedo-wearing panda rising from the koi<br/>pond. It held up a sign, [Now, I'm going to have to pay<br/>for the dry cleaning!]<p>Kaneda brought his head back around the corner. "Nabiki!<br/>She took Mr. Saotome's clothes from his traveling pack."<p>Ranma-kun asked, "What is a panda doin' in a tux,<br/>anyway!" After the panda signed, Ranma-kun said, "You!<br/>A job? Right. What? Your "Good Friend" ain't gonna let<br/>you freeload any more!"<p>Kaneda's former opinion of Ranma's father returned, "The<br/>panda was only working because Nabiki blackmailed him. I<br/>bet he WASN'T trying to pay his way!"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>When it came time to eat supper, Ranma and his father<br/>were still arguing, by both non/and verbal<br/>communications.<p>And Kaneda had been near them, watching the whole time.<br/>He was at the other end of the family table from his own<br/>father. The Saotomes sat along the side near the open<br/>garden door.<p>Saotome He doesn't deserve a polite form. was sitting<br/>at the family table, back in his white do-gi. But he<br/>still had the black top hat on, "I WON'T take this hat<br/>off at the table!"<p>Ranma-kun, next to him, sneered, "You just don't want<br/>people too see your bald head."<p>Saotome said with dignity, "Don't you know, boy: Bald is<br/>in! It makes a man look more rugged and handsome."<p>Ranma-kun reached for the hat, "Then we GOTTA take that<br/>hat off!" And as he struggled hand-to-hand with his pop,<br/>he said, "Your ugly puss needs all the help it can get!"<p>Kaneda wondered, "How does that hat stay on, even in the<br/>middle of a fight?"<p>His dad told him, "It was one of the techniques my friend<br/>Genma developed. He said his baldness reminded him<br/>of...well, a little man he didn't care for." Which didn't<br/>mean Genma hadn't been self-conscious before. He had<br/>started going bald at a very young age.<p>The Saotomes stopped the worse of their rough housing<br/>when Kasumi came in. She was not carrying supper, but a<br/>teakettle and a pail of water. She said, "Nabiki should<br/>have replaced your headcloth when she put your clothes<br/>back in your pack, Uncle Saotome. She should NOT have<br/>gone into your room in the first place. It was wrong."<p>Ranma-kun asked, "What is WITH all the quick-changing of<br/>the clothes?"<p>Kaneda offered, "I could teach the technique to you,<br/>Ranma."<p>Ranma-kun got a sour face, "No thank you! I'm gonna hold<br/>onto as much of my guyness as I got left. If somebody can<br/>get my old man in a monkey-suit, I ain't gonna give 'em a<br/>chance to get me in a prom dress or nothing." Ranma<br/>realized he hadn't meant "nothing" like naked...like Pop<br/>had been in the garden. But now that Ranma thought it,<br/>being nude would be better THAN being in a dress.<p>It did not help his mood.<p>Kaneda's mood wasn't much better, Rrr! That's going to<br/>make it that much more of a challenge to get Ranma over<br/>her conditioning. No good future father-in-law.<p>Nabiki came into the room, "Okay. Everything's back where<br/>I found them."<p>Kasumi had set the teakettle down on the table; now she<br/>placed the pail of water beside the elder guest, "Uncle<br/>Saotome, it will be quicker if you change down here."<p>Genma Saotome looked at the water. It was plain on his<br/>face he did not like the idea of becoming an animal<br/>again, even for a moment.<p>Meanwhile, Kaneda was thinking, He didn't EXPECT an<br/>apology, let alone demand one. Not that he's likely to<br/>get one from Nabiki.<p>Keeping his back straight, the future father-in-law<br/>dipped his hands in the pail, and brought them up.<p>Kaneda thought, ...I guess if you want apologies from<br/>others, they might expect apologies from you. I bet<br/>Saotome owes a lot of them.<p>Saotome splashed his face. The panda took his place,<br/>without the top hat.<p>Kaneda thought, Well, THAT part of the change is the<br/>same. How fast Kaneda changed depended on how hot the<br/>water was and where it splashed on him more than how much<br/>water got him. The easiest change was when it was around<br/>or above his heart. And, it seems, their hearts, too.<p>(Meanwhile, Kaneda's dad had been overly polite about not<br/>noticing anything different about his friend and guest.)<p>The panda picked up the teakettle and poured the hot<br/>water inside on top of its hatless headKaneda's future<br/>father-in-law took the place of the panda. The man had<br/>on his usual headcloth, besides his do-gi.<p>Saotome tried to see what he felt on his head. He was<br/>obviously happy to have something sensible on his head<br/>again.<p>Nabiki was explaining as she sat down, "Uncle Saotome and<br/>I had a deal. I found him a job..." She then gave him the<br/>cold eye, "...But he tried to duck his responsibility."<p>Ranma-kun also looked at his father: "Gee, imagine that."<p>Genma Saotome said, "It is undignified for a master<br/>martial artist to be a beast of burden."<p>Ranma-kun raised his voice, "A panda IS beast! And as far<br/>as "burden" goes-Lose some weight!"<p>Nabiki said, "I know of all the jobs a martial artist can<br/>get in the area. There's more money in being a plush<br/>animal."<p>Soun Tendou spoke out, "I am sure this is all a<br/>misunderstanding. I am sure Genma remembers the<br/>importance of responsibility he learned in our younger<br/>days. If we just discuss this..."<p>Kaneda was beginning to think his changing into a girl<br/>wasn't the only thing his father preferred to forget.<br/>I'm glad I didn't inherit his selective memory.<p>Kasumi said, "Kaneda, would you come to the kitchen with<br/>me?"<p>Kaneda looked at Oneesan, "Since when do you need<br/>anybody's help in the kitchen?"<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi was waiting for Kaneda when he came into the<br/>kitchen. She gave him a follow-me look and left through<br/>the side door.<p>Kasumi was waiting further out on the side yard. After<br/>Kaneda had closed the door behind him, she said, "I think<br/>it's about time to think about having Akane over as a<br/>guest."<p>Kaneda knew this was coming, but still: "You, you want me<br/>to be a GIRL-On purpose! Kasumi, I'm a guy!" He<br/>walked quickly over to her.<p>Kasumi backed away, "You were born a girl. You were MEANT<br/>to be a girl. You are going against your karma. Who knows<br/>how much further damage your are doing to it."<p>The thought of REMAINING a girl made Kaneda desperate for<br/>an idea, "Karma! If karma directs your life, why hasn't<br/>it shown up before now?" He started pacing, "I mean, if<br/>I was MEANT to be a girl, shouldn't I, LIKE guys!<br/>What! I was SUPPOSED to be a girl who likes girls?"<p>Kasumi blushed, "As in..."like"! Oh, my! I hadn't<br/>thought of that." Her brow furrowed in thought,<br/>"...Still, if you were to be a girl long enough..."<p>Kaneda stopped his pacing: "Ranma! Karma made her a<br/>girl!" He hurried back to her, "While we were in the<br/>afterlife waiting to be reborn, maybe we got switched!<br/>This whole thing could be karma correcting the accident!<br/>See! Ranma was MEANT to be a girl!" It helped his case<br/>that it fit well with what Kaneda truly believed.<p>When others may blink at a thought, Kasumi didn't, "A<br/>karmic...accident?" She had to give that some thought.<br/>"Then why has it taken so long with Ranma?"<p>Kaneda had that answer, "Because of her father!" He<br/>frowned at the thought of the man. "He will do anything<br/>to make a man out of Ranma. He'd defy the gods, if he has<br/>to. If we ask him, I bet he'd say, "It's a martial<br/>artist's job to challenge destiny and karma"."<p>Kasumi was still pondering, "...Well, Mr. Saotome does<br/>seem to put great importance in having a son." Then she<br/>sighed, "Just like Father."<p>Kaneda brightened, "Karma corrected the mistake with me<br/>first: Because of Father! Father is more in tune with the<br/>wills of the gods than Mr. Saotome!" Then he gave Kasumi<br/>as sincere a look as he was capable of, "Wouldn't you<br/>LIKE to believe that about Father?"<p>Kasumi's crumbling resolve nearly broke, "Father?"<p>Kaneda thought he could feel it. He had almost won. All<br/>he needed was one last argument, and...<p>Kasumi said, "This is beyond me. We shall take a trip to<br/>the temple and ask for guidance."<p>Kaneda felt his victory slipping away, "The local temple<br/>isn't any good for that kind of thing! It just<br/>commemorates some dumb wild horse. The best you can get<br/>from it are charms."<p>Kasumi nodded. She said, "Then we shall find a temple<br/>that can help us." She thought of a moment, "For<br/>something this important, I'll let my favorite charm<br/>direct the choice. It'll help bring good luck."<p>Kaneda was a skeptic; he didn't really believe. "Kasumi,<br/>that omamori isn't an amulet! It's a talisman. An amulet<br/>is supposed to attract luck. A talisman is supposed to<br/>keep away-" But then, neither did he disbelieve:<br/>"Kasumi, since this is about ME, why don't we use MY<br/>talisman!" Maybe it'll keep the bad luck of having to be<br/>a girl away.<p>Kasumi didn't blink again. "Oh, my! The one Father got on<br/>the day you were born? But didn't the strange old woman<br/>who sold it to him say that it was to remain under your<br/>mattress?"<p>Kaneda almost chuckled, "I'm sure no evil will jump out<br/>from under my bed during the few minutes it will take you<br/>to use it."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>When they came back inside the kitchen, Kasumi asked,<br/>"Kaneda, will you serve supper for me?"<p>Kaneda protested, "That's for girls! You said you would<br/>stop thinking about me that way until..."<p>Kasumi gently agreed with him, "...Until after we visit a<br/>temple"." She nodded as she smiled her calming smile. "It<br/>is getting late. Most temples are already closing."<br/>Traditional temples, those not on clocks, were open from<br/>dawn to dusk. "The sooner we have a clear path, the<br/>sooner the house can return to its serenity."<p>Kaneda wanted to scoff. The Tendou house was seldom<br/>serene. But he couldn't do that to Kasumi, You mean your<br/>own serenity, dear Oneesan.<p>Kaneda still didn't want to do it. I could ask Ranma to<br/>do it. THAT would cause a fight. But Oneesan HAD asked<br/>him. He lifted the tray with the bowls of kelp soup on<br/>it.<p>He, of course, ended up spilling some on himself.<p>Kasumi paused at the kitchen door to look at the girl in<br/>the pink jumper, and white blouse and socks. "Oh, my.<br/>Perhaps this is an sign."<p>The black haired Kane-chan just looked at her. No.<br/>Kasumi didn't plan this. That's not like her. ...Is it?<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan set the tray back down, and went to the sink.<p>After changing back to himself and his regular clothes,<br/>he picked up the tray again.<p>When it happened again, Kane-chan said glumly,<br/>"Maybe it is a sign."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>When Kane-chan brought the tray into the family room,<br/>Ranma-chan was yelling at her father, "What'd you do that<br/>for!"<p>Saotome told her, "How would you like to have a part time<br/>job! I'm sure there are openings for a waitRESS!" It<br/>hurt him to say that about his son. But he was in the<br/>mood to test just how much of a "son" Ranma was.<p>Ranma-chan hit him, "I ain't gonna be work as a girl!"<br/>The other hand emptied what was left of the water in the<br/>pail over her pop's head, "I'd rather live off the land!"<br/>She glared at the panda, "I had enough practice the<br/>way you raised me!"<p>The panda signed, [I did it not to spoil you].<p>Ranma-chan told him, "Go eat bamboo!"<p>Nabiki said, seeing Kane-chan, "Speaking of waitresses.<br/>Akane! You even have the costume almost right." Nabiki<br/>smiled, "We just have to raise the hem, and lower the<br/>jumper's bib." She was of course referring to the type of<br/>waitress uniform so popular among Japanese cartoonists.<p>Setting the tray on the table, Kane-chan glared at her,<br/>"I'm not letting you get me a job, either."<p>As the panda poured hot water from the teakettle over<br/>itself, Ranma-chan said to Kane-chan, "Well! You DO<br/>know how to act like a girl." Kane-chan noticed that<br/>Ranma-chan went from looking at her boobs down to her l<br/>egs. (At least the hem was knee-length.)<p>Kane-chan wanted Ranma-chan to look at her as a guy.<br/>Crossing her arms over those boobs, she told her, "Not<br/>any more!" She plopped down onto the floor on her now<br/>padded butt. "If anybody wants to eat anything else, they<br/>can get it themselves!" She sat like a guy, with her<br/>knees apart.<p>Kaneda's future father-in-law told Ranma-chan, "Go get us<br/>our supper, Ranma! It'll be good waitress practice."<p>Ranma-chan turned to glare at him, "I told you, I-HEY!<br/>Don't drink that hot water!" She lunged at him, and<br/>tried to grab the teakettle away from her so-called<br/>father.<p>But his future father-in-law kept her at his longer arm-<br/>length away as he drank from the spout.<p>Kane-chan nodded to herself. Right! I've been studying<br/>them long enough, I think. I've got the idea how Ranma's<br/>dad pulls her strings. "As long as you're in the<br/>kitchen, you can use the tap to change...That is IF you<br/>don't WANT to be a girl."<p>Ranma-chan slammed her small fist down on the table so<br/>hard the bowls jumped, "I TOLD you: Only HOT hot water<br/>gets rid of my curse!" Her head snapped back in time to<br/>see her pop finish the last of the kettle's water. "Why you!"<br/>She would have beaten him up, if they weren't guests at a<br/>dinner table.<p>Kane-chan said sarcastically, "Oh, that's right. You're<br/>much more stuck as a girl as I can be. All *I* have to do<br/>is turn on the cold water."<p>Feeling frustrated, Ranma-chan slammed both palms on the<br/>table as she leaned over it, "Then go in there do it! THEN<br/>bring us our supper!"<p>Kane-chan leaned forward in a challenge, "Then I WOULDN'T<br/>be a girl."<p>Nabiki said, "Well, SOMEBODY has to serve supper."<p>BOTH Kane-chan and Ranma-chan glared at her.<p>Nabiki glared back at them, "I'm management. Management<br/>does not serve."<p>Kane-chan said, "This is a strike. That's when management<br/>lowers itself."<p>Ranma-chan said, "Yeah!"<p>Nabiki leaned an elbow on the table, "I've been a girl<br/>longer than either of you. I know about diets. Let's SEE<br/>who can hold out the longest."<p>That's when Ranma's stomach growled.<p>Kane-chan said, "That's not very lady-like."<p>Ranma-chan yelled, "Shut up!"<p>Saotome started to rise, "Then *I* shall serve."<p>Ranma-chan yanked a leg out from under him, "You just<br/>want to eat MY share, Old Man!" His Old Man had already<br/>finished off his and his own soups!<p>Kane-chan said, "And YOU wouldn't, Ranma? Do you steal<br/>other people's food, too?"<p>Ranma-chan rose to her knees, "No! *I* don't take other<br/>people's food!" ...most of the time. And ONLY when she<br/>was really starving. (Of course, with how hard she<br/>trained, she starved fairly often.) "Just Pop's! And only<br/>because HE steals mine!"<p>Kane-chan rose to her knees, "Then PROVE it! Go in there<br/>and serve us OUR food: Yourself last."<p>Ranma-chan went up on one foot, "What kind of stupid<br/>challenge is that!"<p>Her pop frowned at Ranma, "My son has no honor when it<br/>comes to food."<p>Ranma-chan was up, now. One foot was still on the floor;<br/>the other one was poised to stomp her Old Man. "You must<br/>be thinkin' about yourself!"<p>Kane-chan said, "She just doesn't have the will power to<br/>wait to eat."<p>Stomping the floor in frustration, Ranma-chan growled<br/>even louder than her stomach. She then tromped out for<br/>the kitchen.<p>Nabiki just looked at the other two. She made no comment,<br/>but it was clear from her look she recognized a masterful<br/>con. She would have to reassess her little sibling's<br/>abilities...and character.<p>Kane-chan ignored Nabiki. She told her guilt, When Ranma<br/>comes back with the food, I'll say something nice to her.<br/>She'll begin to see acting nice makes her feel nice. And<br/>being nice is part of being feminine. Kane-chan had<br/>nearly as many warped ideas about what it meant to be a<br/>real girl as Ranma.<p>But Kane-chan wanted to be served as a guy by Ranma-chan.<br/>She looked for some cold water.<p>Saotome was about to pour a glass of water on Kane-chan's<br/>dad! "Soun, my old friend! Come out of it, man. You're<br/>going to miss supper."<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kasumi had come downstairs with Kaneda's omamori<br/>talisman. It was a rectangle of pink silk with two holes<br/>for a loop of red string. On one side was a gold emblem<br/>with black kanji characters written over it: [By grace of<br/>Benten, let Amaterisu have the ears of the Kamis of<br/>Water].<p>She took it over to the phone table across from the front<br/>door.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>The first thing Soun Tendou saw when he came out of his<br/>trance was Kane-chan.<p>His eyes began to glaze over.<p>Kane-chan froze.<p>Nabiki pulled Kane-chan down by a shoulder strap of her<br/>dress. She said, "Daddy, this is Akane Saotome." She then<br/>fixed a laser like eye on the girl in her grasp. "Isn't<br/>that right: Akane!"<p>Akane got the idea. She bowed, awkwardly trying to put<br/>her knees under her only after, "That's right. I'm, uh,<br/>Ranma's cousin, Akane. I'm happy to be a guest in your<br/>home, Tendou," she swallowed, "...san."<p>Kaneda's father's anguish eased. "Uh, I'm glad to meet<br/>you...Akane."<p>Her possible father-in-law said, "I don't remember<br/>anybody telling me Ranma has a cousin."<p>Nabiki informed him, "A niece! You have a niece: As in<br/>female? ...Or would you rather have a son-in-law?"<p>Saotome's regard of Akane only changed slightly; but it<br/>was for the better.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Holing the talisman by its string, Kasumi placed it<br/>against the section of the phone book that had the<br/>listings for the temples. Saying a prayer, she then<br/>riffed the pages, letting the omamori find its way<br/>between the pages.<p>She then swung the talisman over the open pages...<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<p>Kane-chan straightened up, placing herself on her legs.<br/>She had to sit like a girl now that she had to pretend to<br/>be a girl. She asked, "Is there anything wrong, Mr.,<br/>Tendou?" She looked down at the body she was in. What<br/>else am I doing wrong?<p>Kaneda's father started getting misty eyed. "No, not...at<br/>all, Miss. It's just, just that you remind me, of<br/>somebody."<p>Kane-chan's sigh was nearly a groan, He's not going to<br/>blank out on us, but he is going to cry! At least when<br/>he's in his trance we can have a little peace. She hung<br/>her head, As long as Akane's around, he's going to be<br/>reminded of something he WANTS to forget.<p>Soun Tendou's tears began to run, "You're the very image<br/>of my dear, departed wife! Oh, how I've missed her these<br/>past ten long years!" His tears flowed, now, as his voice<br/>rose in feeling, "It's as if clock had returned far<br/>beyond her that sad time-To the very day I first met my<br/>dearest Kimiko!"<p>Kane-chan had leaned WAY back. Only one hand kept her<br/>from falling over. "I don't look that much like Mom-Um,<br/>Mrs. Tendou!"<p>Nabiki smirked a smile, "Oh, I wouldn't say that. I'd say<br/>you resemble her as much as Kasumi or I." Actually there<br/>was a very strong resemblance. "And Kimiko means<br/>"Beautiful Girl"." She rested her chin on the back of her<br/>hand, "There's nothing wrong with being considered a<br/>beautiful girl, is there?"<p>Saotome also got an wicked glint in his eyes, "Now that<br/>it's come up: Yes, I say she DOES look like your<br/>wonderful Kimiko, Soun. In her younger days, before she<br/>was lined and wrinkled."<p>Kane-chan raised her voice, "She was never lined and<br/>wrinkled!"<p>Saotome said, "No, but the photograph Soun carried around<br/>with him everywhere got that way. He loved her very<br/>much."<p>Trying to get control of himself, Soun Tendou asked as<br/>politely as he could at the moment, "And wha, what did<br/>you say your name was, again, Miss?"<p>Kane-chan knew she should run, but she said, "A, Akane.<br/>Akane, Saotome."<p>Soun Tendou was instantly up on one knee, "Saotome!<br/>Did you say your name was SAOTOME!"<p>Any answer Kane-chan could come up with was stuck in her<br/>thin neck.<p>Saotome answered for her, "Yes, Soun; that's what she<br/>tells me. She's a cousin of my son Ranma."<p>Soun rose up full. He bowed formally to Akane, "Would you<br/>consider dating me, Miss Saotome?"<p>Kane-chan now DID try to run. She scrambled on her hands<br/>and knees as her toes dug into the tatami mats to lift<br/>herself. "NO WAY!"<p>She banged her head on the tray Ranma-chan had just<br/>brought in. With quick reflexes she caught the tampura<br/>prawns, sweet potatoes, and mixed vegetables again.<br/>But she let the teacups of hot water she'd made sure to<br/>bring fall.<p>Splash. Splash.<p>Kaneda had only escaped being a girl. Ranma-kun blocked<br/>his exit.<p>Ranma-kun looked up at the guy two inches taller than<br/>himself, and smiled. He glanced at the others, "I heard<br/>something. But what exactly was it?"<p>Nabiki struggled to not to appear as shocked as she felt,<br/>"Daddy, he just asked Kan-Akane for a date."<p>Soun Tendou bowed his head, red faced, "I'm afraid<br/>embarrassed the innocent girl, and she fled. I was<br/>overcome by her beauty and charm."<p>Kaneda turned, and backed up against Ranma-kun, "She's<br/>too young for you!"<p>Soun Tendou sighed, "You're right. She obviously doesn't<br/>care for older men." Then he brightened, "But she's not<br/>too young for you, my son!" he said, looking straight at<br/>him.<p>Kaneda cried, "What!"<p>His dad said with hard resolve, "Having her around as a<br/>daughter-in-law will be enjoyment enough." His eyes began<br/>to water again, "Just to be able to gaze upon my dear<br/>Kimiko's face again..."<p>Kaneda stammered, "But, but, I'm already engaged, to,<br/>to..." His hands patted...<p>Through half-lidded eyes Ranma-kun said, "Yeah? WHO are<br/>you engaged to, FELLA?"<p>Saotome smiled, "What a wonderful idea, Soun! We can make<br/>the announcements official: Kaneda and Akane, and Ranma<br/>and Kasumi!"<p>Kaneda yelled, "You can't do that!"<p>Ranma-kun yelled, "Yeah!"<p>Saotome gave him his sly stare, "As the eldest Saotome,<br/>and the head of the clan: I can."<p>The End of this chapter<br/>[Notes: Kaneda's may be different from the typical<br/>omamori because it is a special talisman.<br/>-Amaterisu is, of course, the Goddess of the Sun.<br/>-Benten was originally Sarasvati, the Hindu god of<br/>water who became the Japanese goddess of "Reasoning<br/>Facility", love, eloquence, wisdom, the arts, music,<br/>knowledge, good fortune, power, fame, and long life as<br/>well as water. She is also one of the seven lucky gods.<br/>-There are more than one water kami.]
