</div>She Likes To Hit Ranma Chapter Six: Regardless of Taste<p>Opening Notes: Okay, I don't have what some would call good grammar...but thank you<p>Griffin12, you not only ripped and insulted me but you did it with style.<p>And not just any style, but still, you didn't really go into detail about what you<p>liked about the fic.<p>Any way, thank you everyone one who read and reviewed the fic...but as for me<p>knowing what all of you are thinking...it is an expression...not a statement...<p>And about me not posting anything until summer...turns out I had one more<p>chapter lurking inside of me...amazingly it wasn't for Hiko No Show...which has<p>incredibly short chapters...<p>Any way, I'm gonna say this up front; Hentai No Ken is not directly a school of<p>anything goes...lets just say it was inspired.<p>Chapter 6: Regardless of Taste<p>Short of stature, temper, and moral; the three hundred-year-old martial arts master<p>known as Happosai sat upon a meditation stone in the back yard of the Tendo house hold.<p>He was taking the morning to smoke his pipe and consider what path through town he<p>should take on today's mission of liberation. Today he hoped to liberate many of his<p>silky darlings, and the beautiful bosoms they restrain. He chuckled at the pun he had<p>made. Yes, truly by liberating the silky darlings he was doing a service to<p>society...besides, he needed the ambient ki of from the women to continue his survival.<p>And what would be worse than a world without him? It was truly unthinkable.<p>"HAPPOSAI," Shouted Akane as she flung open the sliding door to the yard.<p>Clenched in her hand was a now slightly crumpled piece of paper, the one that<p>had been left in the wake of the hussies she had seen taking Ranma. She had made up her<p>mind that when she found them; they were as good as dead. She had to save<p>Ranma...she just had to.<p>The diminutive martial arts master looked up at Akane from the place he had<p>chosen to sit and relax. He could see her aura, though it was far from visible to anyone<p>else, dripping with anger and malice. This was the first time he had seen her aura truly<p>do so in many days. He had known what Ranma and Akane had been up to, and had kept<p>quiet about it because he could sense their auras' beginning to take on a perverted energy<p>that any master would be proud of. However, hey now could sense an air of urgency<p>about the girl before him. Something important needed to be said and he would not hold<p>her in the delivery of this important information.<p>"Yes?" he replied, looking up from his pipe.<p>"Listen you old lech!" she had run over to the old man and lifted him up by the<p>collar of his purple gi, "Perverted martial artist just showed up and kidnapped Ranma and<p>left me with a challenge letter! Hentai No Ken School of Ultimate Perversion Martial<p>Arts! Ring any bells? Well, you are the perverted master of Anything Goes; this should<p>be something you should know!"<p>She was now shaking the old man furiously as she was explaining the cause of her<p>recent displeasure. Happosai listened as intently as he could to the information being<p>force-fed to him, but he held on and could comprehend the situation quite clearly.<p>"Akane my dear, please calm down," Happosai said while tapping her on the<p>shoulder from behind.<p>Akane turned and looked at Happosai who was now behind her, eyes wide in<p>shock. She looked back down at what was in her hands and found P-chan with his eyes<p>swirled in dizziness.<p>"..." Akane stared at the scene before her before setting the unconscious pig<p>down on the ground and looking at the founder of her fighting style.<p>"Now then, perverted martial artist you say...hmm...never in my life had I heard<p>of a school openly named in favor of its normally secretive perverted ways," the master<p>thought while puffing a plume of smoke, "This leaves us with one option,"<p>Happosai turned around and started walking towards the house. He motioned for<p>Akane to follow him inside, which she did, and proceeded up to Nabiki's room. Having<p>no worry about running into her, as she was at school, the ancient master waltzed right in<p>and sat down in front of her computer. Akane entered behind him, cautiously and<p>confused.<p>"What...what are you doing grandfather Happosai?" she inquired as she<p>nervously realized that her sister wouldn't take too kindly to her room being entered<p>without her knowledge.<p>"Just whatever it takes to find out what we're dealing with," Happosai was typing<p>quickly, he had logged onto the computer using Nabiki's own user name and was now<p>opening up her internet browser.<p>Akane's eyes were further widened with shock. Happosai knew how to use a<p>computer. Happosai knew how to use and break onto Nabiki's computer. After a few<p>moments of watching him type, the old lecher turned to face her with teary eyes.<br/>"Akane...this is embarrassing...but I can't find a search engine. The only<p>addresses I know are these," the old man pointed to the screen.<p>After but glancing at the screen, Akane had to use all her will power in an attempt<p>to hide her furious blush. Needless to say, the attempt failed. She should have known<p>that the old pervert would have only known how to use the Internet for one thing. She<p>couldn't believe how one track minded he could be. She sighed and pushed him aside<p>slightly and began typing, after closing all the screens the old man had chosen to open,<p>save for the last one.<p>It caught her eye suddenly and at the last second so she could stop herself from<p>closing it. On one of the pages stood a full body length image of the woman who had<p>ensnared her Ranma in chains. The same mask, the same hair, the same eyes, and the<p>chains were wrapped around the man in the picture in the same way the chains had been<p>wrapped around Ranma. She stared at it intently before turning to the shriveled old man<p>beside her.<p>"What site is this," she inquired with acid on her tongue.<p>"Ah, this is Madam Alicia's Parlor," the old man responded happily, "It caters to<p>a large variety of tastes and interests. Why you could almost say they cover every form<p>of perversion in existence,"<p>"That's one of them!" Akane roared leveling her finger on the screen, "That is<p>one of the women who took my Ranma1"<p>"Your Ranma?" Happosai smirked as he took a puff of his pipe.<p>"Err...umm...I..." Akane was looking for a way out of this situation, but<p>obviously found none that involved explaining it here and now.<p>"Relax child," Happosai laughed, "I've had my suspicions all week. The secret is<p>safe with me,"<p>As the master was talking, Akane had thought it best to silence him for the next<p>few weeks by using Mallet-sama. However when she heard him say that her and<p>Ranma's secret was safe, she lowered the bludgeoning instrument and stowed it away<p>before the old master had a chance to look up.<p>Akane then noticed on that the site had an advertised location for those interested<p>in joining the Parlor. It matched the address on the challenge letter. She sat there<p>angrily, but happy, for Happosai had inadvertently helped her find what she needed. She<p>was sure she would make these heinous perverts pay for their crime of separating Ranma<p>from her.<p>"Master Happosai," she was now ready to swallow her pride and do something<p>she never thought she would have to do.<p>Ranma had killed a god to save her life...and was willing to do anything to<p>protect her...now it was her turn to do something to save him. It was truly something<p>harder than anything he had ever done to save her was. Something that if not done right,<p>would damn her soul to an eternity of torture at the hands of the greatest evil to ever<p>exist.<p>'Damn it Ranma, I hope you appreciate this,' she thought.<p>"I...I want you to train me for my fight against that woman!" she declared again<p>pointing at the screen, "I have one week before the fight. If you'll teach me the true<p>nature of Anything Goes...please, for Ranma's sake if not my own,"<p>The old master took out his pipe and knocked some loose ashes out of it onto the<p>floor. Thinking for a moment he looked at the screen, at the daughter of his former pupil,<p>then back at the screen. After sighing, the old man returned the pipe to his lips and<p>inhaled. As he released the relaxing haze he spoke.<p>"Yes,"<p>Akane didn't know whether or not to beam with pride, or sulk in terror.<p>Becoming a direct student of Happosai's meant she would probably be subjected to the<p>same type of treatment and attention that Ranma had gotten from the old fool.<p>"But first we're going to study what your mystery opponent is capable of,"<p>Happosai darted for the mouse and clicked on something on the screen.<p>What was displayed next made Akane turn away from the screen and blush<p>furiously. Happosai, on the other hand, seemed to have no trouble digesting the visual<p>information before him.<p>"SWEETO!" he thoroughly approved of this young woman's style.<p>_ _<p>Ranma found himself drifting in and out of consciousness. Every so often, when<p>he was aware, he noticed that he was still tightly bound with chains. His captors had not<p>loosened his bonds at any point during this, nor had he found any way to loosen them on<p>his own accord. When he finally awoke completely from whatever pressure point had<p>been applied to him, his eyes darted around the ill-lit room in which he had been left.<p>Finding he could make out no details of the space around him, he thought it best<p>to recount the events that had lead to his present captivity. He thought back past the haze<p>that his paralysis had left him in to recall what might have been hours prior to whatever<p>time it was now. Seeing no windows around could not find a way to discern what time it<p>was.<p>When he was able to get a clear hold on his memory, what he found had left him<p>shocked and slightly disturbed. Five women who were perverted martial artists had<p>shown up. While he and Akane had really gotten into their mock argument, their leader<p>had ensnared Ranma with some kind of living chains. Then she effortlessly lifted him<p>up, activated a pressure point on his face by licking him, and said she was sorry about<p>this. And the voice he remembered apologizing to him in was a voice he knew and found<p>thoroughly familiar, it was Kasumi's voice. Beyond that, his captor had Kasumi's eyes<p>behind the mask.<p>Ranma's eyes widened at this realization. His eyes opened as wide as they could<p>before the shock passed through his system. He didn't quite know what to feel in this<p>situation. Neither betrayal nor anger seemed appropriate. Either way he would have a lot<p>of choice questions for her if he ever saw her again...<p>Ranma's wide eyes suddenly and forcefully shut in reaction to every potential<p>light source in the room flaring at once. When his eyes adjusted, he found the lights too<p>bright to make anything out. All he knew was that very powerful spotlight were pointed<p>at him from numerous directions. Suddenly a shadow fell across his eyes as a figure<p>stepped before the frontal light. The figure was a dark silhouette, which slowly took on<p>more shape as it approached. And when Ranma could finally see who it was, he was<p>again at a loss for words.<p>"Hello Ranma-kun," her voice was sweet and sedate and seemed to flow with her<p>blue dress and white apron, "I hope you slept well. I'm terribly sorry if you are in a state<p>of discomfort but it is fully necessary,"<p>She said every word with the same smile she had used ever second of every day<p>that Ranma had known her. There was no ill intent in her voice, nor anything that<p>betrayed any of what had happened to be horribly wrong and at the very least,<p>unexpected. Ranma's confusion grew to the point where he was about to try and trash<p>about in his bonds demand answers to the questions that were now floating about his<p>mind.<p>As he opened his mouth to speak, he suddenly found his view of Kasumi blur for<p>an instant, when her image became stable and Ranma tried to speak, he found something<p>peculiar. Kasumi had moved at a speed that rivaled his own and secured a ball gag and<p>tied it around the back of his head. Saying this furthered Ranma's aggravation would be<p>a grave understatement. He began to thrash within his cocoon of chains, only to find<p>them tighten and further restrict his movements. Also, there was intense pain as they<p>constricted, which caused him to move and thrash a little bit more. This stated a cycle<p>that lasted for a few minutes before he found himself passed out in pain.<p>Kasumi sighed, shook her head, and reached out to the side with her left arm.<p>What that arm returned with was a pale of water, which she immediately unloaded upon<p>the pigtailed boy's head. The boy, who was currently a girl, immediately awoke, noticed<p>that the bonds that had restricted him earlier were loose because he was now a she and<p>much smaller, and quickly slid out of them before they could reaffirm themselves to his<p>person.<p>"Kasumi," Ranma was cautious as he still couldn't tell exactly were this place<p>was, "What's going on here?"<p>Kasumi just smiled and tilted her head.<p>"Why Ranma-kun, you're going to help me with a special gift for Akane," a whip<p>appeared in her left hand, not that Ranma noticed of course.<p>"What are you talking about?" Ranma had no time for games; he needed answers,<p>"Tell me what's going on now,"<p>Any preconceptions he had held for the eldest Tendo sister for the past two years<p>were now shattered. Her demeanor may be unchanged but he still didn't feel one<p>hundred percent sure of his safety or his ability to defend himself against her considering<p>what happened earlier. If Kasumi really was capable of capturing him so easily, then he<p>wouldn't be able to pull punches. But then again, this was Kasumi... none of this was<p>making any sense.<p>"Sigh... I overheard you and Akane talking the other night in the living room,"<p>she smiled as Ranma paled, "And I thought it would be nice if I helped you get used to<p>certain things for Akane,"<p>She brandished the whip and took a fighting stance. The pile of chains behind<p>Ranma-chan glowed blue and shot up to entangle the limbs of the currently lithe body<p>that belonged to the pigtailed martial artist.<p>"What the," Ranma reacted in time to avoid the chains on their first strike but they<p>pursued him through the overly lit room, "You ain't making this any easier on yourself<p>Kasumi!"<p>"Ranma, please," Kasumi gripped the side of her dress and tore it asunder<p>revealing her black body suit, "I only mean to properly prepare you for Akane!"<p>Ranma leapt up and with his female body's speed continued to avoid the snaking<p>chains that were now coming from all directions.<p>"Prepare me?" he shouted as one chain caught and held Ranma-chan's wrist, "For<p>what?"<p>Kasumi's face took on a sudden shift. Her eyes became intense and her smile<p>became smug.<p>"I'm going to break you, Wild Horse!"<p>With that, the whip was cracked.<p>_-_<p>Author's notes...<p>Well what do you guys think?<p>I know I don't think much these days.<p>Ah, Geek Week, the best week ever<p>Anyway, I hope you all like this chapter<p>And I hope I can write more stuff...<p>I know I said I was done till summer but, just for tonight I couldn't resist<p>Good night ladies and gentlemen!
