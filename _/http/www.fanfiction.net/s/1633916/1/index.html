</div>She Likes to Hit Ranma<p>A Ranma ½ fan fiction by Phantom Crossing<p>I do not own Ranma, but I will ownz all of joo in Quake! Sorry.I'm trying to quite L33T!... Ahem, again sorry.<p>Anyway I just thought I'd use this opportunity to do a Lemon, cause I do like lemons, but maybe eventually some lemon lime flavor, gotta love that lemon lime flavor, hmmmm good.<p>You know what..I just realized that I read way too much erotic fan fiction, to the point where I am depressed that there are no R rated Speed Racer fan fiction in the archive..something to work on for later I suppose, Well regardless, I just wanted to have some fun writing this, as my first completely written lemon ever! Well not in this chapter but still.<br/>Now if you'll excuse me I must be off, let the creativity flow!<p>Chapter One: Stupid Tomboy Idiot Pervert<p>Akane Tendo was running, running as fast as her legs could carry her.  Not but ten minutes prior to this made attempt to break away from reality she had so recently realized with her own mind. She was so bitterly pained by this she couldn't help but cry. After so long it finally made sense, the patterns of her life finally all fit together. Unfortunately that made her a hypocrite, she didn't want to accept it about herself but it was so painfully obvious now. Confusion, she didn't know if she should revel in this or be disgusted with herself. she didn't know what to do.<p>- Twenty minutes prior -<p>"RANMA NO BAKA!" the raven haired girl screamed pulling a giant mallet from nowhere.<br/>Her swing was arched horizontally; its impact sent the boy known as Ranma Saotome hurtling towards the far outer wall of Furinkan High School. By day to day standards, what had happened was completely and totally normal.<br/>"HOW DARE YOU INSULT THAT BENTO BOX, I MADE IT JUST FOR YOU!" she shrieked running towards his prone form with the mallet high above her head.<br/>The look of anger in her face and upon her aura was hot enough to boil water. As the mallet fell forward to crush the unconscious youth into the ground, Akane's eyes widened and she developed an almost feral smile. As the head of the hammer impacted against Ranma's head, there was the ever present sound of the paved sidewalk beneath him giving way to his flesh and making a crater in his outline. Akane released the mallet and fell backwards, landing on her ass, breathing heavily. She didn't know why she was almost panting. It wasn't even a full sprint for her to run that distance with the hammer in hand. Something was wrong; she had already hit Ranma once, why did she feel the need to land a finishing blow. Was it because she hadn't hit him skyward this time. she didn't know.<br/>She continued to breathe heavily, on the verge of hyperventilating. She had no idea exactly what was going on. Letting her eyes land briefly on Ranma's twitching form she felt her heart quicken and again she could feel another large blunt object gripped tightly in her hand.<br/>Staggering to her feet she raised the slightly smaller mallet above her head as she had the last one, this time with uncertainty in her eyes.<br/>"RANMA NO BAKA!" she screamed again to reassure herself.<br/>As this hammer impacted against the boy, she felt herself becoming short of breath again, her heart was racing. She didn't understand. She just continued to hit Ranma, and the feeling grew. The rate she was hammering away at him increased alongside this growing feeling. Then something started to build within her. It was an odd and new feeling. When this feeling had built and swelled with time and each hit she delivered to Ranma, something within her gave. She felt a strange sensation roll over her body and she collapsed to her knees lost in the sensation. Pleasure, rapture, and warmth enveloped her as she tensed up every muscle in her body in response to the sensation. She hadn't noticed her low moan during this sensation and was wondering why everyone was looking at her all the sudden when she returned to herself.<br/>Taking a moment to take stock at what had just happened.<br/>One, she had beat the living hell out of her fiancé.<br/>Two, she had thoroughly enjoyed doing such to him even though in retrospect he didn't deserve that much of a beating for whatever it was he did to set her off; this said because she forgot what it was that did so in the first place.<br/>Three, when that enjoyment had reached its peek a wave of indescribable sensation had overwhelmed her.<br/>Four, her panties were quite damp right now.<br/>She put everything together and slowly rose to her feet with watery eyes about to cry. The tears broke forth and she began wailing as she turned to run leaving a very confused student body in her wake. This brings us to where we are now.<p>- Back to the present -<p>"Did. did I really enjoy it that much," Akane was wondering while sitting beneath a bridge gazing at her hands.<br/>She was lost and confused in this. For some reason, today she got so lost in hitting Ranma that she found herself enjoying giving him physical pain. Doing so to the point where she herself had an orgasm in the process.<br/>"I'm. I'm a pervert," she sobbed wrapping her arms around her knees as she brought them to her chest, "I'm a perverted freak."<br/>She found herself slowly trudging home after many hours of crying and sitting. Among many things she thought she needed to do, she found herself wanting to sit in the furo for at least an hour before she did anything else once she got home.<br/>It was already dark when she found her way home. Carefully she slipped past everyone unnoticed, as they were all eating dinner, discussing how they should search for the missing daughter. Of course they were berating Ranma for not being a good fiancé and looking after her.<br/>Ranma was heavily bandaged and bruised from the beating Akane had given him earlier. It was obviously very severe because he was still bandaged, normally he would have shaken it off by now and been at his full cocky self, but he had come home from school with a limp. He noticed when she came in as the others ate and talked. It didn't take long for him to excuse himself from the table to go upstairs and take a bath. There were no objections and he went about his business.<br/>When he got upstairs he noted that Akane's cloths were in the hamper, he also noted the unusual sent. Coming close to the door that separates the changing room from the bathing area he knocked and waited for a response. When none came, he decided to get her attention in another way.<br/>"Akane, I know you're in there," he began, "I. I want to talk to you about what happened earlier. I'm drawing a blank so you'll have to fill me in,"<br/>Ranma Saotome had no idea what had happened earlier. The beating was so much that he actually didn't remember anything that had happened that day, aside from Akane obviously giving it to him with her mallet.<br/>"Ranma." her voice was choking back tears, "I'm sorry. okay. I lost control and. and. I just can't talk about it right now,"<br/>Ranma knew something was serious. If Akane had hit him enough to make him lose recent memory it was a serious matter.<br/>"Akane. if you're really that upset about whatever happened earlier." he swallowed his pride, "I'm sorry for whatever I did to set you off today..."<br/>Under normal circumstances he would have called her an un-cute and sexless tomboy. Effectively putting his foot in his mouth and insult her. This was different. He was seriously hurt after whatever it was that Akane had done to him, and judging by the normal amount of punishment he took from Akane in a single day, this was about six months worth up front.<br/>"I'm sorry," he clenched his fist, "I'm sorry for everything,"<br/>"It's not your fault Ranma," she said barely loud enough for him to hear, "I, I just sort of lost it. You didn't do anything out of the ordinary. I'm the one who needs to apologize,"<br/>Ranma pressed his hand against the door.<br/>"Could you tell me what happened," the pigtailed boy inquired.<br/>"You insulted the bento box I made you, and then I lost it and went psycho violent sexless macho chick on you for seven minutes," she was crying.<br/>He could tell from her voice.<br/>She had referred to herself with the usual insult Ranma would hand her in such a situation.<br/>"Akane. I. well." he couldn't think of anything to say.<br/>He wanted to be straight with her about everything. He wanted to do anything besides what he was about to do. Yet he did it anyway.<br/>"You left out un-cute,"<br/>"Excuse me!" she shouted back.<br/>It worked. she wasn't crying anymore. Now she was just mad. Ranma could handle Akane mad. He couldn't handle Akane with tears, but mad he could handle. at least after what happened earlier, he hoped he could handle the situation.<br/>"You were calling yourself by all the insults I normally throw your way. but you forgot un-cute. and I think I use that one a bit much. well a lot more than I use the other ones I guess. I'm sorry. maybe I use it so much you didn't want to say it cause it hurts. I mean I wasn't implying nothing just now but, ah," Ranma Saotome was scratching the back of his head looking for words.<br/>The door slid open, he fell forward. Akane, clad in towel, grabbed him by his collar and threw him to the floor of the washroom. Still gripping the collar she placed her knees on either side of Ranma and loomed over him with fury in her eyes. With her free hand she slapped him across the face.<br/>"You're damn right it hurts!" she slapped him again, "Especially coming from you, you big jerk. Coming from any other guy I'd welcome the comment, but from you! FROM YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT!"<br/>The entire time tears were streaming down her face. She continued, open palm slapping him in the face and back handing him for about four cycles of such before she realized what she was doing.<br/>"EEP!" she blushed in realization and literally jumped off of her position over Ranma and curled herself in the corner trying to look away.<br/>"No. no. no. I almost did it again," she was cringing and crying, "I'm not going to do it  .no. no,"<br/>She was visibly shaken. Ranma had no idea what was going on now. Propping himself up with one arm, he used the other to rub the sides of his face one at a time.<br/>"Uh, Akane," he began.<br/>"Don't look at me!" she shot back.<br/>"What's wrong. this isn't normal, even for you," he noted.<br/>It can be said that in the recent months after Saffron. and after the failed wedding, Ranma and Akane had reached a point where they obviously understood their feelings for each other. Though through lack of knowing how the other felt caused the same old patterns of behavior to be repeated. albeit a bit lessened until this recent outburst.<br/>"I. I can't tell you," she cringed.<br/>"Akane. I can keep a secret. now tell me. at least give me an explanation that makes sense,"<br/>She looked at him with eyes wanting to trust him but unsure.<br/>"Pr. promise me first,"<br/>"Promise you what,"<br/>"That you won't tell anyone. you won't tell anyone about what I'm about to say," she sighed.<br/>"I swear on my honor as heir to the Saotome Ryu that I'll guard it as closely as I guard my food from pops," he said.<br/>She was unsteady for a moment, and she thought about his promise. Finally she spoke.<br/>"I can't tell you yet. please don't make me," she couldn't think of any other response, "I'll tell  when I'm ready,"<br/>"Akane, please. this isn't like you," the concern in Ranma's voice was genuine as he looked into her eyes.<br/>"You can't make me tell you until I'm ready," she whimpered back.<br/>Ranma rose to his feet and sighed. He had only one option left. Mentally he held his foot high and opened his jaw wide.<br/>"You know what Akane, when you're mad you're un-cute," he turned an looked away from her and started slowly to the door, "But when you're bawling your eyes out its just pathetic,"<br/>He slid the door closed behind him, his statement leaving Akane boiling in anger. Before she could rise, go after him, and make him pay, the door slid open just a enough for her to see half of his face.<br/>"Seeing you like this hurts almost as much as when I thought you died at Jusendo," the door shut quickly and she was left in silence.<br/>Ranma just./ she was at a loss for thought.<p>End Chapter...<p>Yup<p>That's the chapter,<p>Word Perfect sucks, it sucks hard,<p>Microsoft word is the opposite of sucks, it rules, rather it rules with a z, making it Microsoft word Rulz!...BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<p>Tell me what you think so . I know I suck at detailed character conversations while trying to stay true to canon. well lets face it, the closest I've ever come to keeping a characterization canon was in my trigun fic, and I haven't touched that one in weeks. regardless, Flames/suggestions/comments/and general babble is always accepted and encouraged. well I'd rather no one say the obligatory praise without general commentary on the nature of the writing. Please people, I need to have errors pointed out to me that I would otherwise miss completely. Things regarding canon, grammar, spelling, and pointless and inane details that only all of you, my fellow fan boys and girls, can point out to me.<p>For any of you who developed sudden indignation for calling us all fan boys and fan girls en'mass. please consider, we read and write  a massive archive . it is the truth, because within every one of us is, ah crap for crap, never mind, anyway, feedback is needed, really really needed.
