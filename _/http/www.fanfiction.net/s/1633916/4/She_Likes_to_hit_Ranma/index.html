</div>She likes to Hit Ranma Chapter 4<p>A fan fiction by Phantom Crossing, who hence forth will be known in casual conversation as Four Rings God, that's right the Four Rings God. You heard me. Why the Four Rings God? I'll tell you why.<br/>I'm sad, alone, and starved for attention . . . there are you happy . . . I SAID ARE YOU HAPPY DAMNIT!<p>Anyway again thank you all for the support, even though I start this primer for chapter four when I've only got one review of chapter three that said something along the lines of "Good, please continue" in fewer words. Any way I hope every one likes this string of frequent updates for this fan fiction, for once college starts then they shall come with far less frequency. Any how, let's get this on with. I now present for your reading pleasure and scrutiny. Chapter Four: Trial and Error<p>Oh, before I forget, Takahashi-san owns Ranma ½, I merely write humble fan fiction and vulgar nonsense. HORAY!<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++boobies+++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Chapter Four: Trial and Error<p>Ranma and Akane walked through the streets of Nerima. After Ranma had risen from his slumber the Dr. Tofu acted as a temporary mediator between the two of them before asking them to leave the clinic and discuss the matter amongst themselves. During the entire explanation Ranma had remained silent . . . even now he was silent, and that silence was eating away at Akane's soul. It was obvious now that they had missed the entirety of the school day as the sun was approaching dusk.<br/>Ranma looked as if he were deep in thought . . . as Akane grew more worried and nervous by the second.<br/>They stopped on a hill vista overlooking the district and watching as the sun slowly made its descent below the horizon.<br/>"It . . . it doesn't change anything Akane," Ranma began leaning his arms on the mid height fence.<br/>"What?"<br/>"It doesn't change the way I feel," Ranma's eyes were focused to the ground.<br/>As previously explained, in the months since the failed wedding, Ranma and Akane had become aware of their own feelings and aware of each others feelings. The only thing missing was that Ranma and Akane were not ready to admit those feelings to each other.<br/>"And . . . how do you feel Ranma?" she stepped up beside him placing her hand on his, "How do you feel about me?"<br/>This was it, the perfect opportunity. Ranma knew that this was important, so important he kept both feet firmly on the ground. He wouldn't be tasting foot during this conversation. He'd stick it out and tell her how he felt no matter how red in the face he got, no matter how embarrassed, and no matter how much it hurt his pride to do so.<br/>"I . . . I guess . . . I just . . . It's that . . . I this . . ." Ranma was stuttering and stammering.<br/>Rather than put his foot in his mouth he was forcing himself to wade through the wall of fear and insecurities that had built themselves up around his emotions towards Akane. From the get go of this babble he was blushing lightly, now his face was tomato red.<br/>"Since we . . . back then . . . I got . . . and if . . . always those . . . I then . . . it am I . . . you then . . ." he was shaking all over.<br/>"Ranma?" Akane's voice was soft and hopeful.<br/>Ranma stopped his incoherence and took a deep breath while closing his eyes. When they opened anew they held a fierce determination and strength.<br/>"Akane, it's always been you that I -" Ranma's words were cut short by a familiar sound and cry.<br/>'RING RINGALING,' sounded the bicycle chime on a bike outfitted for delivering Ramen.<br/>"Aiyah Ranma! Shampoo bring you too too delicious noodles just for you," chimed the Chinese Amazon as her front tire rested in perfect balance on Ranma's head.<br/>Ranma stood there in his stooped position for a few seconds that seemed to cumulate into an eternity. There were no words he could think of to express his dismay that he was interrupted during such an important conversation with Akane. More importantly interrupted while in the midst of what might have been his most important declaration of his feelings ever. He was angry at this, so very angry indeed.<br/>"Hello, Shampoo to airen," the Amazon said as she waved the bowl of Ramen before Ranma's face, "Is airen home? If no then Shampoo just have to kiss and see,"<br/>As the forward and passionate girl known as Shampoo brought her face towards Ranma's, she found there was something blocking her path. Opening her eyes which had earlier been closed in a seductress fashion she found one of Ranma's hands open palmed pushing forward against her face. Ranma calmly and silently raised the hand as he gripped Shampoo's face. Shampoo was lifted off the ground by this and dropped the bowl of Ramen she held and wrapped her hands around Ranma's arms trying to break free.<br/>Ranma then pushed his arm forward, bringing Shampoo's back towards Akane.<br/>"Akane . . . if you don't mind," Ranma's voice was a mix of hurt and anger.<br/>"Sure Ranma . . . sure," she produced a mallet of substantial size and brought it across horizontally against the Amazon's side, sending her beyond the vista and made her but a faint shining dot in the sky above.<br/>Ranma, in turn having released Shampoo's face as Akane's mallet hit, removed the bicycle from his head and sent it skyward after the Amazon with a mighty hurl while Akane shouted.<br/>"LEARN SOME DAMN MANNERS BEFORE YOU INTERUPT SOMETHING THIS IMPORTANT!" her voice dripped of venom and malice before shifting to something sounding happy and innocent, "Ranma . . . you were about to say something,"<br/>"Um, yeah, I was . . ." the confidence in his voice wavered, "Just need a . . . what I mean is . . . got to recollect my thoughts and . . . you smiling good . . . and in the . . . I and this . . ."<br/>His stuttering returned. Akane now grew impatient.<br/>"Tomboy . . . wouldn't . . . you any other . . . and eyes your . . . nice smile . . . and I this then . . ." suddenly Ranma felt and intense pain shoot through his body as his voice was raised several octaves, "ARGH!"<br/>"OUT WITH IT!" Akane demanded as she further twisted her hand in its current position before releasing and sending Ranma curling to the ground twitching in pain.<p>" 'thveyouanyotherway   ngasyouyoulovemeback," the pigtailed boy gasped from his fetal position.<br/>"I didn't quite catch all that," Akane sighed.<br/>Ranma pulled himself up on the fence. His voice seemed to return to its normal setting.<br/>"What the hell was that for?" Ranma demanded.<br/>"You were stuttering, it was important, and I wanted to hear it!" Akane growled back.<br/>"Stupid un-cute tomboy," Ranma spat.<br/>"Ranma no baka," Akane returned raising her hand to slap him across the face.<br/>She released her frustration in this strike aimed for his cheek, but it never connected. Ranma had caught her wrist and stopped the attack as if it were nothing. This was the first time he had deliberately caught or stopped one of Akane's attacks.<br/>"What I said was . . . Akane it's always been you that I love and I need to know if you love me back," Ranma's voice held a stone resolve as he blushed, "I mean I need to hear it from you. How you feel I mean,"<br/>"Ranma you dummy," she lowered her head and Ranma became worried, "Of course I love you . . . I just don't know how to,"<br/>"I don't know how to either," he said still blushing while bringing his hands gently to Akane's shoulders after releasing her wrist, "But together maybe we can learn,"<br/>Their eyes met with a conveyance of emotion and hope. Akane was shedding tears contrast to the smile across her face. Slowly the two teens began to bridge the gap between them, their lips were barely touching. Akane sensed a faint feeling of déjà vu for all the times they had come this close but never touched, save for the one time when Ranma had been under the influence of the Neko-ken. Their lips embraced, and Akane drew her arms up around Ranma's neck as she had in her earlier daydream, sans the chains and straps of course.<br/>The tears were still rolling down Akane's cheeks as they kissed, and a few strayed across the intertwined lips. When one tastes a tear they expect it to be bitter, however as they tasted the stay tears that had made their way between their kiss, a sudden sweetness entered their mouths. Tears of sadness may be bitter, but tears of joy can be surprisingly sweet.<br/>Breaking the kiss, Ranma looked deeply into Akane's eyes.<br/>"So, what happens now?" he asked.<br/>"Maybe we can stay here a little longer?"<br/>"I'm . . . Akane I'm not talking about here and now . . . I mean what's gonna happen here in Nerima now," Ranma rested his cheek to her own, "Pops, the fiancés, the rivals, the suitors, the challenges . . . this changes everything,"<br/>"Yeah, I guess it does," Akane sighed, "would it be that bad if we came out and told everyone?"<br/>Ranma thought on this for a second. He thought about what everyone's reaction would be. The only thing that came to mind was the wedding attempt only months earlier. Akane realized this as well and they just stood there a little longer in one another's embrace.<br/>"What are we gonna do?" Akane sighed moving one of her hands into Ranma's hair and nuzzling her cheek against his.<br/>"Leave that to me," Ranma began to smirk, and then the smirk slowly turned into the cocky and confident grin that reflected the nature of his soul, and of course that went to a dopy smile when he realized he was with Akane, on a vista, at sunset, and she was nuzzling his cheek and playing with his hair, "Leave everything to me,"<p>Soun Tendo was normally a reasonable individual, if not for a small issue of sometimes breaking down into hysterical tears whenever home or domestic matters became too stressful for reasons of emotional instability since the passing of his wife some even or twelve years ago, however recent events over the past week within his home were beginning to wear his patience and reason thin.<br/>"RANAM NO BAKA!" shrieked Soun's youngest daughter as she put the length of her arm fist first through wall opposite Soun as he sat drinking his afternoon tea.<br/>"HA! Missed again ya klutzy sexless un-cute tomboy," sneered Ranma from what sounded to the Tendo Patriarch from far away.<br/>These events were unfolding in the side yard of the house; Soun could only imagine the visualization of these things. By sound alone, possibly loud enough for the whole block to hear, he had bore witness to his daughter and her fiancé's latest exchange. To make matters worse, it was the fourth exchange of its kind today. The sounds of scuffling, objects breaking, and insults flew through the air.<br/>He sighed and took another sip of his tea.<br/>"Hey a cat!" he heard his youngest use this ruse against Ranma for the seventeenth time in three days.<br/>"BAH! CAT WHERE?" he heard the panic of Ranma's cry of terror.<br/>Soun calmly removed his cup of tea from the table and placed it underneath, along with himself as Ranma came crashing through the wall, over the table, through the sliding door, and into the koi pond. Akane stood there in just outside the Ranma shaped hole in the wall with a wicked smile on her face and what could only be described as an air of malice in her eyes.<br/>"You fall pretty easy for that trick, and here I thought you were a fast learner," Akane placed both hands on her hips and began laughing in victory, "!"<br/>Her laughter seemed to continue on until the sound of a foot impacting and pushing off the table was heard. It sounded like Akane had gasped when Soun heard the sound, then the sound of a punch connecting.<br/>"CARE TO TRY THAT AGAIN?" the sound of Ranma-chan's voice echoed as Soun heard it from his spot beneath the table.<br/>"DAMN IT NOW MY NOSE IS BLEEDING YOU JERK!" he heard his daughter.<br/>"YEAH, YOU LOOK LIKE RYOGA AFTER WANDERING INTO A WOMEN'S BATH HOUSE!" then Ranma.<br/>"HENTAI NO BAKA," his daughter.<br/>"UN-CUTE SEXLESS TOMBOY!" it was Ranma again.<br/>Soun Tendo couldn't stand it anymore. He had put up with this near constant extended hostilities between his daughter and Ranma for close to a week had been a true strain on his being. With all the strength he had he stood up, bursting through the tabletop and shouted to the two youths now fighting in the dining and living room.<br/>"ENOUGH!" his voice commanding and firm towards the two adolescents.<br/>Akane and Ranma-chan turned their heads towards Soun without changing their stances. Akane had a giant mallet raised high to bring down on Ranma- chan's head, as Ranma looked as if she were charging a Moko tabishin blast.<br/>"This has gone on for long enough. For the past seven days the two of your have done nothing but bicker and fight. Look what the two of you have done to the house, the dojo, and the yard!" the Tendo patriarch motioned for them to look around the immediate area.<br/>Sure enough there were Ranma shaped holes of both male and female form. Mallet craters and holes, ki blast burn holes, punch and kick holes and some Akane shape embeddings in the yard.<br/>"I'll have no more of this foolishness in my house. I understand how this kind of thing can happen when Ranma is fighting a rival or trying to stop the evil master but this is ridiculous!" Soun was obviously angry, "For seven days there has not been a moment of peace in this house. Now I want the two of you to start cleaning up this mess and have a decent amount of it done by dinner! Are we clear?"<br/>"Yes dad," Akane huffed while shooting an annoyed look towards Ranma.<br/>"Crystal, Mr. Tendo, crystal," Ranma-chan scoffed.<br/>Kasumi walked in from the kitchen carrying a tray with a kettle of tea on it. Her ever present optimism had mysteriously survived the solid week of constant destruction. Setting the tray on the part of the table Soun had not burst through. To note, Soun was still standing in the hole he had made.<br/>"Oh father, speaking of dinner, well their latest fight started in the kitchen and it seems that it won't be seeing any more productive usage for a little while," the eldest daughter explained.<br/>"I see Kasumi. Very well then," Soun looked up with a new resolve in his eyes, "Then we will all go out for dinner tonight while Ranma and Akane remain here to continue their cleaning efforts.,"<br/>Akane and Ranma-chan looked to the ground with what could only be described as contempt.<br/>Hours passed and eventually the family left to go out for dinner. Once the two were sure everyone was at least two houses down the street, Ranma and Akane let out a joint sigh.<br/>"Took them long enough," Ranma smirked as he plopped down on the couch.<br/>"Yeah . . . so, what'd you think?" Akane inquired taking a seat next to him.<br/>The two had cleaned up all they could without the hiring of a construction company and were glad they had planned today out so well. To be more specific, the entire week had been orchestrated to see how it would work out with them consciously flirting through argument and expressing their feelings through physical combat. So far it seemed to be working.<br/>"Well . . . I'm still not crazy about hitting you . . . but it's been interesting otherwise," Ranma said nodding his head and bringing a hand to the spot he had earlier punched on her face, "does it still hurt?"<br/>"No . . ." she said in a sad voice.<br/>"So . . . what do you think about the past week?" it was Ranma's turn to question.<br/>"I'm not one hundred percent comfortable with the whole thing just yet but I'm almost there," she leaned against Ranma putting her head on his shoulder, "But it's been exhilarating and exhausting every step of the way otherwise. And I'm happy I'm doing this . . . with you,"<br/>"Yeah, me too," he draped an arm across her shoulder; "well, not exhausting. Maybe we can spend the next week solely on your endurance,"<br/>"Baka, everything is training with you," she quipped too tired to move from under his arm.<br/>"Yeah, I guess it is. And it's been doing you good too," he leaned his head against her own, "I mean in the past week all the work we've done on balance has made less of a klutz,"<br/>Ranma was about to laugh when he felt teeth sink into his neck. He jumped up and yelped holding the space Akane had chosen to try and take a chunk off of while looking indignant.<br/>"What the hell was that for?" he yelled.<br/>"Remember Ranma, the more it hurts the more it means I love you," she was giggling, stifling against more full force laughter at what she had just done.<br/>"Very funny . . . you know sometimes you're pretty cute for an un- cute tomboy," he said while somewhat uncomfortably reaching out for a point on her blouse.<br/>Akane let out a gasp as he pinched this point, more specifically her right nipple. Once he had it in hand . . . excuse the pun . . . he started twisting it fast counter clockwise, then progressively slower through the fabric. Akane moaned slightly from this.<br/>"Ba . . . baka," she managed to get out.<br/>"What, was I going to fast? To hard?" he immediately released and grabbed her shoulders.<br/>"Baka," she rapped him on the head with a loose fist, "Try faster and harder next time. No, never mind, lets forget about practicing it tonight and just enjoy the peace a little before everyone gets home,"<br/>"Listen Akane . . . in the past nine days you may have had an easier time taking to this stuff than I have . . . and I guess I just need more time and practice to get used to the you know, the you me alone type stuff," he slumped his shoulders while resuming his seat next to her.<br/>"Well . . . it was my fetish to start with so it reasons that you might not take to it as quickly as me," she sighed.<br/>"The fetish is your department," he began, "I'm talking about you me and I don't know, couples stuff. Being alone . . . I still feel like everyone's watching . . . and, ah never mind,"<br/>"No . . . keep going," Akane insisted, interesting in hearing what it was he had to say.<br/>"I just can't get comfortable . . . I don't know," Ranma sighed.<br/>"So what, the great Ranma Saotome is chickening out without a fight," Akane yawned again resting her head on Ranma, this time his chest.<br/>Ranma flinched at this comment.<br/>"That's a low blow and you know it," Ranma looked down at her and returned his arm around her.<br/>"Ranma," Akane's voice sounded tired.<br/>"Yeah,"<br/>"Thank you,"<br/>"You're welcome, eh, for what?" Ranma inquired.<br/>"For mixing the flirt fights with training . . . for taking me serious as a martial artist," Akane seemed on the verge of dreams . . . she yawned.<br/>"Hey, no problem," Ranma replied, "yawn . . . you know those are contagious Akane,"<br/>"Baka," her words were less than a whisper.<p>Kasumi had forgotten her purse as she and the family had left for dinner. She didn't realize this until she was a block from home. Hurrying back she made her way to the front door and opened it silently. After quickly and quietly retrieving her purse she heard something.<br/>"What the hell was that for?" she heard Ranma yell.<br/>"Remember Ranma, the more it hurts its means the more I love you," her youngest sister's voice reached her ears.<br/>Kasumi would be late for dinner; she would listen to this exchange a bit longer.<br/>"Oh my," her words were silent as she listened further, "Oh my oh my,"<br/>Kasumi smiled her usual warm and gentle expression as she left having heard all she needed to. Her baby sister was growing up, and so was Ranma at long last. This would all prove quite interesting in the near future. It was sweet how they were trying to trick everyone into thinking they were fighting so they could be left alone. And whatever this was about Akane having a fetish definitely deserved more looking into, of that Kasumi was certain.<br/>As Kasumi was catching up with the family she looked back towards the direction of the dojo, and instead of flashing her usual warm and oblivious smile, it appeared as more of a knowing smirk with a facial expression that would have taunted had anyone seen it.<br/>"Just you wait baby sister;" she whispered back, "The fun has just begun,"<p>End chapter four<p>Author's closing comments, rambles, and delusions about reality<p>       OOO!<p><p>WHO DA MAN?<p>PHANTOM CROSSING IS DA MAN<p>Holy fucking crap, ladies and gents I hope you liked this one cause unless I can hammer out a fifth chapter before Sunday this may be all your getting for a while . . . sad as it is to say . . .<br/>The reason for that being that I finally gave in to my old addictions and broke my sacred vow to never again let that addictive power cross my path . . . damn you pokemon . . . damn you!<p>ARGH!
