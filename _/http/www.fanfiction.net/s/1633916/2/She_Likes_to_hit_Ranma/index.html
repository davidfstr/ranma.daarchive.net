</div>She Likes To hit Ranma Chapter two Akane's turmoil<p>Wow, here we are. I, Phantom crossing, just had a day that was hell 'a weird. I mean completely and totally disturbingly weird. So I pull an all niter to finish my first draft of my English final paper which was due for review and edit in class today, and at nine am just as I finish I rest my eyes for a second while sitting at my  I wake up, its 2:45, I'm in bed, and the class I had stayed up all night to do the work for was from 11:30am to 1:15, I slept right through it.<p>ARGH! What the fuck is that about! I don't get it! Sweet merciful crap this semester was insane. Worst of all, next semester I have to put up with being in four different RPGs, one of them is a LAARP.  did I decide to do the dead lance campaign as a thirteen year old mad scientist.I'm an inept swordsman in the dragon lance campaign, and then there is the stooper powers campaign which is just gonna be insane once we roll super  vey...<p>ARGH!<p>I HAD FIVE CUPS OF FRENCH VANILLA CAPIFUCKINGCHINO! WHY DIDN'T THAT DAMN CAFFENE DO ITS GOD DAMN JORB! Did I just say jorb..damn you homestarrunner.. Damn you ..<p>Anyway, I don't own Ranma ½, we all know that the copyright belongs to Takahashi-san,<p>cause she rules. . . no wait, she does not rule, she RULZ with a Z. YEAH HONORIFIC!<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++monkies++++++++++  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + ++++++++++++<p>On with the second chapter:<p>Akane's Turmoil<p>She didn't sleep well that night, cringing beneath her covers she at times wept, and at other times stared out her window wondering. The events of the day replaying through her head over and over. And as the sun peaked through her curtains and cast rays of gold across her face, Ranma's last words from the previous night's encounter echoed through her head. Seeing you like this hurts almost as much as when I thought you died at Jusendo - The concern in his voice wrapped around her like a blanket in the middle of a snowstorm. It protected her, kept her warm and together long enough to dry off and make her way to bed. As she rose up and proceeded to get ready for her morning jog, she wondered silently about all the times Ranma had saved her . . . she remembered all the times he was so overwhelmed with concern for her. . . she remembered what she dreamed she heard the pigtailed boy say atop Jusendo. With each and every step in her journey she found her mind wandering farther and further than she normally allowed. Straining against trying not to remember the more colorful details of what happened the day prior, she decided that she best talk to Kasumi when she got home. Kasumi was her big sister; she was someone she could trust. Someone she could try and talk about the incident with. She was thoroughly sad that her usual confidant had not been around for about a week now. She sighed hoping her precious little P-chan was alright. The poor pig always seemed to leave when she needed him most.<p>A lone figure wearing an oversized back pack took heavy steps through the streets of Nerima ward. Within the past few hours he had found himself in Osaka, Juuban ward, and Topeka Kansas. Each step was made carefully in hopes that his course would not be strayed, knowing the hopelessness of his endeavor but still thinking it worth a try.<p>Ryoga Hibiki was trying as best he could to return to the Tendo Dojo.<p>"Curse you Saotome. . . curse you and your very life," the eternally lost boy growled as he made his way slowly down the street.<p>He suddenly found himself surrounded by trees and foliage. No where in sight were the homes of Nerima, only green as far as he could see.<p>"WHERE THE HELL AM I NOW!" he shouted with arms raised to the heavens.<p>"You're in my front yard punk, and standing in my flowers!" shouted an elderly man pruning a nearby tree.<p>Ryoga lowered his arms, using one to scratch the back of his head.<p>"Sorry sir." he sweat dropped.<p>Suddenly he heard a familiar sound. It was a particular sound which he recognized with ease, the sound of Akane Tendo in tears. Wasting not a moment more he ran in the direction of the noise, and through the old man's remaining flowerbed. Coming to a wall on the edge of the property, he burst through it as if it were made of paper. Once on the other side he saw a bewildered Akane in a windbreaker and shorts. Her arm up against a lamp post and head titled in the direction of the rising dust left in Ryoga's wake. A young man on a bicycle sped bye and through a puddle splashing the young martial artist with water before the dust could clear.<p>"P-chan?" she said looking at him in confusion.<p>The lost boy looked up at her. His entrance had interrupted her. As much as her headband was soaked with sweat, her cheeks were stained with tears. Eyes puffy and red from the painful sobs she had let loose.<p>'Akane . . . you've been crying. Are you," he wanted to say, "are you . . . are you alright?" "Bwee," was what came out.<p>Akane found herself drying her tears on her sleeve and again standing upright no longer supporting herself with the lamppost.<p>"I . . . I need someone to talk to," she confessed.<p>Ryoga being the individual he has always been took this moment in time to immediately jump to the conclusion that somehow it was Ranma's fault that his beloved Akane was in tears.<p>'What did Ranma do to you?' he demanded with a snarl in his head, 'What did he do to you to make you cry? I swear I'll make Saotome pay with his blood for what you've shed in tears!'<br/>"BWEE BWEE!" was what came out.  Akane blinked a few times at this. Her eyes were wide and fixated upon P-chan for his sudden outburst. Noting the piglet's building rage and the purely angered look in his eyes.<p>She wondered why he was reacting as such but quickly put those thoughts to rest as she realized if she didn't say something soon she would break down again and sob. "I...I did something to Ranma," her words caught Ryoga's attention, "I did something to him,"<p>Ryoga for the better part of this statement was caught off guard. What could Akane have done to Ranma to make her cry? Wrought with worry he became suddenly attentive to her every word.<p>"It's best if I explain while I walk back home . . ."<p>Not long after, Akane stood out in front of the front gate of the Tendo Dojo holding the boy turned pig. Ryoga was, for lack of a more appropriate description, beyond dumbstruck in his absorption of everything Akane had just told him.<p>"And the worst part is I can't bring myself to tell him . . . I'd just feel too embarrassed," she sighed as she leaned against the wall.<p>The lost boy could do nothing. From the way she spoke of Ranma in this text. He could do not but force the smile on his pig face to hide his growing depression. Deciding there was only one course of action to be taken, the boy cursed to turn into a small black piglet leapt from Akane's arms and quickly around the corner. Akane just stood there bewildered for a moment before she heard a voice. "Akane-san," She spun around not expecting someone else to be there. Standing a few feet behind her she saw Ryoga. 'Kami Sama! Did he hear my conversation with P- chan!' she shrieked in her mind. "Akane...I...I heard everything," he said in tears. "Ry...Ryoga," the look of fear on her face was indescribable.<p>"Don't worry Akane, I'll talk to Ranma," he said shakily.<p>"No! You can't tell him . . . this is something I need to do," her eyes looked as if they were to again well up with tears.<p>"I won't tell him. But I will tell him to talk to you . . . you both need to talk about this," he himself could do not but close his own eyes and look solemn to avoid his own tears, "Akane . . . you once told me you trusted me...if you say you trust me then I'll not abuse it. I came here to talk to Ranma anyway . . . so I'll just make it a longer conversation than what I planned for," She was stunned. She didn't know what to do. Ryoga knew her secret and...and he was willing to help...<p>"Thank you Ryoga," she said bowing her head before quickly entering the open arch before her home.<p>Once she was gone, Ryoga let his tears run with fervor and unrestrained the depression that was welling up inside him. He couldn't believe what had come to pass. He couldn't believe that though Akane trusted him enough to let him talk to Ranma about this, it was not him that she loved. Ranma . . . Ranma . . . damn that Ranma, the only thought coursing through Ryoga's mind. Why did Ranma have to care? If he hadn't cared about what Akane was currently going through it would be so much easier to make him the villain, so much easier to blame everything on him. It struck Ryoga odd at something he had said earlier. His statement about not abusing Akane's trust suddenly echoed within his mind. Damn it, he thought. She wasn't the hypocrite, he was. He was abusing that trust she had so openly confessed in him since the first time they met, when he became her P-chan. Damn Jusenkyo, damn the pig, damn this life, and most of all . . . damn Ranma . . . damn him for having the kind of chance at happiness that I will never have, Ryoga's mind declared.<p>"Ranma Saotome . . ." he snarled before a sound from beyond the outer wall of the Tendo Dojo drew his attention.<p>It was a splash followed by a very annoyed series of yells.<p>"Damn it pops! I'm still sore from yesterday! What's the deal with you throwing me out the window like that?" screamed an annoyed and female Ranma Saotome, "Why are you holding up that sign to me old man? You're not even a panda yet you damn panda!"<p>With those words, the sounds of fighting resumed on the other side of the wall. Ryoga stood there in thought realizing this as an opportunity. He'd have his talk with Ranma, and finish his already existing business along with Akane's long before the day was out.<p>Leaping skyward he pivoted to look down upon the backyard of the Tendo Dojo; he leaned forward as he began to descend with both gravity and the well of heavy ki that had been building up within him. As he reached an optimum velocity he began shouting to his unaware opponent.<p>"RANMA SAOTOME! PREPARE TO TALK!" he smashed into Ranma, who was just getting out of the Koi pond.<p>This of course sent the two back into said pond. This left a very annoyed and busty red head with an equally irritated black piglet sitting atop his stomach as they sat in the pond.<p>"Morning to you too Ryoga," Ranma said blowing a soaked strand of hair out of in front of his eyes.<p>These eyes of course held nothing but contempt for the form before the boy turned girl. The form that so often climbed into Akane's bed and snuggled with her at night, the form she believed to be a harmless and innocent pet; but was in reality Ryoga's cursed form. Ranma was beyond angry that he was still honor bound to keep the little porkers secret.<p>Grumbling he dragged the little pig with him into the house and upstairs to the washroom to get some hot water and find out what it was that Ryoga wanted to talk about. Once the two of them were done turning back, Ranma turned to Ryoga.<p>"Okay pig boy, what is it you want to talk about so bad that you needed to dive bomb me to get my attention?" the cocky martial artist inquired.<p>"First, you and Akane need to talk about something that is beyond important at the moment, and once the two of you finish your discussion there's an important matter that I think you, me, and Mousse would be quite interested in,"<p>The lost boy pulled some paper out of his bandanna and handed it to the still toweling off Ranma. Looking it over the young pig tailed boy's eyes went wide.<p>Ryoga nodded as Ranma gave him a look of pure bewilderment. He decided to give his rival an explanation along with the slip of paper.<p>"The Shinto Priests of the Jumon Hakai sect specialize in removing magic curses. And their shrine is hidden somewhere in Nagano. And that paper is a group coupon for one curse removal," the lost boy smiled.<p>"What's the catch?" Ranma inquired.<p>"Huh?"<p>"You wouldn't be willingly showing me this if there wasn't a catch,"<p>"Well . . ."<p>"Well what?"<p>"The smallest they consider a group is six people," Ryoga said.<p>By some strange gravitational phenomena not yet fully understood within the world, the individual known as Ranma Saotome suddenly found his feet pointed skywards and his head firmly implanted into the floor below him. Having completed this face fault, he turned back to Ryoga who was tying up his boots.<p>"How long is this coupon valid for?" Ranma demanded.<p>"Till next spring," Ryoga answered.<p>"Damn," Ranma said.<p>"What?" Ryoga inquired.<p>"There are only five cursed people in Nerima."<p>Akane stood at the door about to leave for school. As she opened the door, Ranma came down the stairs casually with school bag in hand.<p>"Hey, Akane, wait up," he called to her.<p>"Ranma . . . you missed breakfast?" she inquired trying to stay casual.<p>"Ah . . . yeah, um, I ran into Ryoga and we kinda had a talk that lasted longer than I expected," he said looking down as they made their way to the gate.<p>"So then . . . what did Ryoga say to you," she inquired.<p>"Well . . . among other things he aid you and I needed to talk," Ranma's voice trailed off as he made quick eye contact with Akane before then looking down.<p>"Yeah, we do," she was about to start choking on her own breath.<p>"He said you were worried about how I'd react to whatever it was you had to tell me. Something about being terribly embarrassing but deathly serious," they had passed the point where he usually jumped up on the fence but he remained on the ground walking beside Akane.<p>"Ranma . . . I need you to understand that this was as much a surprise to me as it will be to you okay,"<p>"Okay,"<p>"I'm really confused about it right now so please don't . . . please don't think any less of me for it okay. Its something very weird and I'm not totally comfortable with it yet,"<p>"Okay so just tell me already. How much weirder than the norm around here can it be. I turn into a girl when splashed with water. There are people around here who can break rock with their bare hands. And two people who cumulative age is six hundred. I don't think whatever it is that you're having a problem with could possibly be weirder than anything we haven't handled before," Ranma said as he stopped, grabbed Akane's shoulders and turned her to face him, "Now please. I'm worried about you. I need you to tell me what's going on you stupid tomboy. Okay?"<p>She slapped him once with a great amount of force across the face. Then she took the same hand and rested it against the spot she had hit him. Looking down her bangs obscured her eyes with shadow as she spoke.<p>"I . . . I think I get off on hurting you Ranma,"<p>Ranma Saotome fainted and fell to the ground with eyes and jaw wide open.<p>End of Chapter two.<p>WAWHOOOOOOOOOOO! Chapter two done Sorry it took so long, I took a little break from my fan fiction writing to work on my web comic coming soon to a Rydia server near you. Anyway that is way besides the point.<p>I want to thank all the people who threatened to kill me if I left this fic unfinished. I hope you all like the update.<p>Because I like living and don't want to die Please don't kill me I'll be good, really I will . . . no, no! Not the face! ANYWHERE BUT THE FACE!<p>ARGH!<p>Well as you all can see I started this chapter back during final papers for the semester (college = tough) and haven't finished it until, well lets just say its sometime in late January. Anyway I thank all the people who've like my fics so far and that they not worry cuz I'll keep em coming.<p>VIVA EL CROSSING DE PHANTASMO!<p>POST REVIEWS FOOLS AND POINT OUT ERRORS TO ME AND GIVE ME MUCH NEEDED SUGGESTIONS!...cuz Ranma fainting was all I had left...(sadness)
