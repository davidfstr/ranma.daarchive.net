</div>Shattered Pieces<p>Disclaimer: The characters and back-story of Ranma 1/2 are the creation<br/>of Rumiko Takahashi. This story is inspired by 'Picking up the<br/>Pieces' by Masaki Yang Yi.<br/>- Chapter 1 -<p>"Ranma, you pervert!" The sound of a bucket impacting a skull rang<br/>throughout the house. The next thing Nabiki, sitting outside in a lawn<br/>chair to enjoy the early afternoon rays, saw was a pig-tailed martial<br/>artist flying through the doors in a smooth arc to land in the koi<br/>pond.<p>"Excellent," she smirked to herself. Standing up, she walked over to<br/>the pond and dragged the unconscious, now-female, figure out. "My<br/>little sis sure got you that time, Ranma. Really, you should have<br/>learned by now about walking in on people using the bathroom." Even as<br/>she tsked, she thought to herself, 'Of course, it would have been<br/>easier for him if I hadn't removed the 'occupied' sign from the<br/>door...'<p>Picking up the satchel she had prepared earlier and placed by her chair,<br/>she resumed dragging Ranma, taking him out of the yard and down the<br/>street. It was early enough on a Sunday that there were no on-lookers<br/>to stare at the sight of one girl dragging another. As she reached an<br/>alley perhaps a block from the dojo, a dimunitive ninja stepped from<br/>the shadows, calling her name.<p>Nabiki unceremoniously dumped Ranma's head onto the ground. "What took<br/>you so long, Sasuke?" she asked.<p>"Master Kuno wished me to avoid the dojo. He is worried that the<br/>sorcerer Saotome would somehow discover of the impending date with his<br/>'tree-borne kettle girl', and invoke his vile magics to interfere."<br/>Removing a wallet from the folded cloth of his uniform, the servitor<br/>extracted a large amount of cash and gave it to Nabiki.<p>Shaking her head as she took the money, Nabiki bemusedly<br/>responded. "Uh, yeah, right. So he's still planning on taking her to<br/>The Diamond Chandelier?" The restaurant she named was an expensive<br/>French restaurant on the other side of Tokyo; if Kuno were to go<br/>there,it'd undoubtedly be in the family limo, and he'd have to find<br/>Ranma new formal clothes. Nabiki almost unconsciously suppressed the<br/>jealousy she felt. Instead, she focused on what she'd get out of the<br/>event. 'Ka-ching! I'm sure whatever dress he finds for her will fetch<br/>a pretty price. Or maybe I'll keep it for myself, for the prom...'<p>Her mercenary planning was interrupted by Sasuke. "Yes. Master Kuno is<br/>confident that each time they meet, he is one step closer to breaking<br/>Saotome's spell."<p>Nabiki looked sharply at her helper, but the ninja's rodent-like<br/>features were surprisingly impassive. Normally, Nabiki's trained eyes<br/>would be able to pick out a flurry of emotions in Sasuke's face<br/>whenever he spoke of his master, but he seemed to be trying to keep<br/>his face still. 'What's going on?' Nabiki wondered, but before she<br/>could pursue the matter, Sasuke continued, "Master Kuno is interested<br/>in this potion you use ... he wishes to know how it keeps Saotome from<br/>locating his lady love. He has authorized me to pay 500,000 yen for<br/>the formula."<p>Nabiki's eyes bulged outwards. 'Hmm, so Kuno still thinks this is a<br/>magic potion. That's good; it means he probably won't go looking<br/>around for anybody else to provide the formula. But if he does, he'll<br/>go to the chemistry club, and they'll give it to him. It didn't take<br/>much convincing for them to give it to me, after all. Even worse would<br/>be if Kuno asked somebody else; there's too great a chance one of the<br/>fiancees would find out." She carefully avoided considering what would<br/>happen if Ranma himself were to find out. "Kuno just doesn't<br/>understand the value of cool discretion. It's too risky - I'd better<br/>keep him satisfied.' All of this took just a second of thought; Nabiki<br/>narrowed her eyes, and replied, "Sure thing. Anything for Kuno-baby,<br/>after all." And with that she hastily scrawled the recipe on a piece<br/>of paper, and handed it over to Sasuke. "Just make sure Ranko's back<br/>at the dojo by midnight."<p>While she was thinking of Ranma and the potion, she bent over and<br/>tilted his head back while pressing a bottle to his lips. Soon enough<br/>the liquid in the bottle was vanished, and Nabiki began softly<br/>slapping Ranma's cheeks. "ugh, whassh going on? Pops, zatyu?" the<br/>small red-head slurred.<p>"Time for you to wake up, little Ranko..." Nabiki chided. Ranma - or<br/>Ranko, as Nabiki had told Kuno her name was - was entirely out of it,<br/>unable to focus on what was going on. "Just accompany the rat-faced<br/>one, and he'll get you all sorted out."<p>Sasuke's face remained impassive, despite her dig at him. Handing over<br/>the promised sum for the formula, he slipped his arm around Ranko, and<br/>turned to go; as he began to step away, he stopped and silently<br/>turned back. "Nabiki Tendo, answer me this question: why do you do this<br/>to a family member?"<p>Not showing her surprise at Sasuke's question, Nabiki innocently<br/>asked, "Why, Sasuke, do you think I would stand in the way of<br/>happiness for my dear cousin Ranko and her beloved?" Seeing he was not<br/>content with that, she mercurially changed her speech. "Look, Kuno<br/>wants a date with his goddess, and is willing to pay well for that<br/>privilege. Ranko needs a little /convincing/ to not cause a scene; I<br/>provide that convincing. They go out for a dinner, a few drinks, they<br/>go home. Kuno has a wonderful time, and in the morning, Ranko won't<br/>even remember what happened. No harm, no foul, right?" Nabiki didn't<br/>even notice that her speech had sped up throughout the speech.<p>Sasuke's form was silent. Then, haltingly, the words Nabiki was<br/>waiting for came. "Yes. No harm, no foul." Slowly turning, he left,<br/>dragging the semi-aware Ranko behind him. Nabiki looked at his<br/>retreating back for a few minutes, idly fingering the thick wad of<br/>cash in her pocket.<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>"Ranma, m'boy, you're getting sloppy! Oh, if your mother were here to<br/>see you now!" Bemoaning the cruel fates, Genma threw his son,<br/>currently a busty red-headed girl, out the window into the koi pond in<br/>the backyard. The still sleepy girl sat up in the pond and cried,<br/>"Hey! What'd you do that for?"<p>Despite her obvious grogginess, the girl had jumped to her feet by the<br/>time the gi-clad Gemma had landed after his own jump out the window,<br/>and with loud battle cries the two streaked at each other, the impact<br/>of their meeting cracking through the air.<p>This signal was a sharp stick probing the house's ant hill, as its<br/>inhabitants began scurrying into their daily activities, the sound of<br/>striking flesh from Genma and Ranma's morning spar serving as an<br/>oddly-compelling percussive background.<p>Nabiki was not normally a morning person, but she had been only<br/>lightly sleeping; her normal deep sleep had been troubled the past few<br/>nights, since her interaction with Sasuke. The Ice Queen rubbed her<br/>eyes, before swinging out of bed and into the hallway.<p>"Good morning, Nabiki." Her older sister Kasumi smiled pleasantly at<br/>her before heading downstairs. "You're up early today; let me start<br/>the furo filling, and then I'll begin breakfast."<p>Nabiki smiled back. "Oh, no need to rush for me, sis. I've got some<br/>work to do that'll keep me busy for a while anyway." For a minute,<br/>Nabiki allowed herself to imagine what it would be like to be as sweet<br/>and innocent as Kasumi, before she shook her head, and went back into<br/>her room. 'Gotta focus, girl; time is money.'<p>She turned back into her room and, digging out her ledger, sat herself<br/>at her desk. Flipping to the latest entries, she barely heard the<br/>cries coming from the yard; her thoughts started filling with the<br/>details of her operations, leaving her with little room for less<br/>mercenary concerns.<p>'Ah, this month is going to be /very/ profitable,' she thought. 'And<br/>all thanks to the new money from Kuno-baby." She felt a little<br/>uncomfortable; she was used to extorting a little cash from people,<br/>but this latest scheme was putting her in a whole new ball-park. She<br/>was actually gathering enough capital that she could get started in<br/>the business world directly, instead of slaving her way up the<br/>corporate ladder for years until her youth and passion were<br/>gone. 'Well, this won't be enough for everything, but it's a step in<br/>the right direction. A very big step.'<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>At school several days later, Nabiki was dragging Kuno's unconscious<br/>body to the nurse's station. "Kuno-baby, you really should have gotten<br/>the point by now. My little sister is not interested in you."<p>"Nabiki Tendo, your mercenary ways have blinded you to true love. Your<br/>sister's loves for me parallels that of my beautiful pig-tailed<br/>goddess. If only not for that sorceror Saotome, who fiendishly renders<br/>her incapable of expressing her adoration!'' proclaimed the<br/>apparently-conscious-after-all upper-classman.<p>"Sure, Kuno-baby. I'm sure in the month before we graduate that she'll<br/>come flying into your arms." She set him on the nurse's couch, and<br/>held out her hand expectantly.<p>"Nabiki Tendo, I despise you." But even as he delivered that flat<br/>message, Kuno nonetheless handed over a quantity of coin. "But I must<br/>meet with the pig-tailed girl again. The soothing charms of the<br/>goddess are all that slake the raging passions that would otherwise<br/>consuming me! No mountain is too lofty, no burden too great, no cost<br/>too much for me!''<p>Nabiki hesitated. Seeing that hesitation, Kuno lifted his hand to his<br/>pocket, and began toying with a piece of paper there. As he began<br/>lifting it, it became obvious it was a check. "Kuno-baby, you know I<br/>had to drug hi,uh,her last time. Do you really enjoy having dinner<br/>with a zombie?"<p>"Tendo-san, if that is the only way I can enjoy her company without<br/>the accursed Saotome's magic turning her against me... then love gives<br/>me no choice."<p>Nabiki thought. She had arranged this sort of 'date' several times<br/>before for Kuno, but she was starting to feel a bit uneasy about<br/>it. Although Ranma seemed to not remember a thing, he seemed to have<br/>nightmares for a few days following. But it wasn't like Kuno was doing<br/>anything wrong to Ranma... she needed more time to think. "Let's talk<br/>about this after school, Kuno-baby. Let's meet at the usual place;<br/>your treat, of course."<p>When the meeting came at a local ice cream shoppe, Nabiki had made a<br/>decision, and firmed her resolve - she had enough money, and even a<br/>high-stakes gambler knows there's a time to fold. "Sempai, you know<br/>that I told you before, if this is done too often Ranma will get<br/>suspicious that Ranko is seeing someone else. And there's just no<br/>telling what will happen then." She managed to keep a straight face<br/>as she said her story, but didn't bother hiding her mocking tone; Kuno<br/>had never noticed it before, why would today be any different?<p>"The horror of this situation. Truly, the Master's tale of Romeo and<br/>his Juliette is no more tragic than Kuno and his tree-borne kettle<br/>girl." Kuno continued on for several minutes in a bizarre chain of<br/>allusions. Rather than try to decipher the riddle of what he actually<br/>meant, Nabiki only sighed. Kuno finally finished, "Know this,<br/>Tendo-san, that as Alexander cut the intricate Gordian knot, so Love<br/>may find a path for my love to flare brightly."<p>Throwing down coins to pay for her ice cream, Kuno wandered off, his<br/>hand firmly gripping his bokken and his gaze intent on some sight only<br/>he could see.<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>Akane, disgusted with Ranma's latest gaffe, ran out of her house and<br/>towards Furinkan high. Her fiance came running after, having paused to<br/>grab two bentos containing their lunch. "Hey, wait up, Akane. I<br/>didn't mean nothin' by it!" He came closer to Akane, reaching out an<br/>arm with her bento. "And you forgot your lunch. It's Kasumi's, so<br/>it's bound to be good. Come on, slow down!"<p>Akane silently steeled her gaze forward, concentrating on the<br/>pounding of her feet on the pavement and the swish of her dress as she<br/>ran. 'What's he trying to imply by that? That my lunches aren't good?<br/>That jerk!' She didn't even notice going by the lady throwing water on<br/>the sidewalk until she heard Ranma's suddenly soprano cursing behind<br/>her. "Ha!"<p>Ranma was not nearly so amused, as she stopped to wring the excess<br/>water from her shirt. 'Damn it, why can't I ever catch a break? If it<br/>ain't some ol' lady or another, it's a broken fire hydrant, or a<br/>drunken Super-Soaker salesmen convention!' Realizing her shirt<br/>was as dry as it was going to get, the female Ranma started to hurry<br/>after the disappearing figure of Akane. 'Maybe I can be on time for a<br/>change,' she thought, not noticing a shadow popping up beside her, and<br/>soon enough she didn't notice anything at all.<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>Akane was feeling quite pleased with herself as the school bell<br/>rang. She had actually managed to arrive early to school, something<br/>that happened all too infrequently since Ranma had shown up in her<br/>life last year, and had a pleasant conversation with Sayuri. They were<br/>still talking over the latest gossip when they entered the classroom<br/>and took their seats. The bell rang, and Akane realized the desk<br/>beside her was still empty. 'Where is Ranma? He should have been along<br/>just after me. Ooh, and he had my lunch, too. He'd better not be<br/>skipping just so I'm hungry!' Her classmates ignored his absence, and<br/>the soft red glow that briefly appeared around her; they had grown<br/>quite accustomed to this sort of oddity surrounding Ranma and the<br/>Tendos.<p>But when Ranma had not appeared by the next day, people were taking a<br/>bit more notice. Akane was obviously worried, although she was trying<br/>not to admit it; a crowd of students had grown up about her when she<br/>entered the wasp nest of a school yard, their voices an irritating<br/>buzz making it difficult for her to think, their questions about<br/>Ranma's absence only a further sting to her unsettled emotions.<p>Sayuri came over to Akane, looking worried for her friend. "Akane, is<br/>it true? About Ranma and that new fiancee?"<p>"What new fiancee?" Akane screeched, her heart suddenly leaping up<br/>in her throat.<p>"Well, Gendo was talking to Haruka last night at the mall, and they<br/>saw a blonde girl coming up to storekeepers,and they swear they heard<br/>her asking around for martial arts dojos. And you /know/ what that<br/>means..."<p>"Sayuri, that doesn't mean anything. Not /everybody/ new<br/>around here is one of Ranma's fiancees." 'And Ranma wouldn't just up<br/>and leave me for somebody, would he?'<p>Akane's other best friend, Yuka, chose that time to join them. "Yeah,<br/>Akane. Besides, what I heard is that some demons were fighting with<br/>somebody over in Juuban. The police aren't saying much, but Aiki<br/>insists her aunt was there, and definitely saw a pigtail. It's<br/>obviously Ranma!"<p>"But then why didn't he come home last night?"<p>"Oh, maybe the demons got him." Yuka grinned as she saw the fear on<br/>Akane's face. "Oh, I'm just kidding. You know Ranma, he's got more<br/>lives than a cat."<p>Akane forced a nervous laugh. "Yeah, just don't tell him that."<br/>'Oh, Ranma, where are you?'<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>After school, Nabiki was drawn to the dojo by the sounds of<br/>smashing bricks. Recognizing her sister as the cause for the bricks'<br/>untimely demise, Nabiki lightly asked, "Seen any sign of your ingrate<br/>fiance, sis?"<p>Akane's explosive grunt as another brick became dust was sufficient<br/>reply.<p>"Look, sis, I know you're worried about him. I've asked ..."<p>"Me, worried? He's probably off with that bimbo Shampoo! Or maybe<br/>Sayuri's right, maybe he's got himself somebody new to add to his<br/>harem!"<p>"Methinks the lady doth protest too much." Nabiki tried to imitate<br/>Kuno's tones, with little success. But she could see Akane's mouth<br/>curling up slightly at the corners, so figured she had come close<br/>enough for her purposes. "Look, Akane, you know Ranma. He's probably<br/>off chasing some rumor of a Japanese Spring of Drowned Boy, or waiting<br/>for a challenger, or found an all-you-can-eat Sushi bar and is<br/>determined he isn't going to leave until there's no food left."<p>Akane managed a smile at that. "That sounds like you, Nabiki. Going to<br/>get your money's worth and all."<p>"Moi? I am hurt, simply devastated that you could say such a thing of<br/>me. But really, Akane, I've asked people to keep an eye out for<br/>him. And it's not like he's never run off before without telling you;<br/>maybe he's decided to go visit some ancient training ground. I bet<br/>you he'll come strolling in here by himself by this weekend, never<br/>even having thought somebody'd worry about him."<p>Akane had noticeably relaxed during Nabiki's speech. "Oh, I guess<br/>you're right, Nabiki. I was just over-reacting. You know me, ol'<br/>emotional Akane."<p>'OK, she's calmed down some. Still upset, but at least Kasumi and I<br/>are likely to live through tonight. Damn you, Saotome, where are you?<br/>What am I going to have to do to convince you to treat her better?<br/>When you get back, expect to suffer like you've never suffered<br/>before.'<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>Author's Notes:<p>Well, this is the first fic I've written that I'm actually releasing<br/>to the public. I've already got a second chapter drafted, which is a<br/>bit darker, and includes some more exciting bits (read: less<br/>dialogue), but I wanted some feedback on this chapter first before<br/>finalizing it. (That way I can unobtrusively fix the more embarrassing<br/>things, before people see them repeated again and again. :-)<p>I wrote this fic because I originally was caught by the potential<br/>consequences in 'Picking up the Pieces', where Nabiki sells Ranma to<br/>Kuno, but Kuno goes a little further than expected. I wanted to change<br/>events slightly, though, and focus a bit more on the characters, so<br/>this was the result. (Accordingly, I'm most interested in whether<br/>people buy the characterization. Also, I don't feel quite happy with<br/>the character's voices, but I'm not sure exactly how to improve the<br/>dialogue).<br/>Incidentally, in case this isn't clear, in this continuity, Sasuke<br/>believes in separate Ranma and Ranko identities.
