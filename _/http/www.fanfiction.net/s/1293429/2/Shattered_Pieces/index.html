</div>- Chapter 2 -<p>Up on the roof of the Tendo dojo, Akane lay, staring up into the clear, azure sky, wanting only to relax after a long and exhausting week. The sun bathed her weary muscles, energy showered over her in a glorious bounty, each minute under its stream washing away hours of stress. The distant murmur of birds were as exciting an orchestral accompaniment as the day deserved, and Akane's eyes began to steadily close.<p>But the percussion section must have felt left out, and begun to improvise a part; the ladder that the Tendos kept in the dojo was clattering on the ground below, a sure sign that somebody else wanted to come up to the roof. The people Akane would have wanted to talk to would have scorned a ladder - Akane had been learning a martial artist's pride of late, but the other martial artists were still much fiercer about asserting their capabilities - so she knew it was somebody come to scold her.<p>Akane stubbornly focused on a distant object and hoped that her inattention would be a hint to her unwelcome guests. But Kasumi's sweet voice was a jangling distraction that wouldn't be easily put aside. "Hello, Akane. We haven't seen you all week, so we thought we'd join you up here and talk." The tone was light, but there was a deep layer of concern lying beneath. Perhaps only a sister would have recognized it, but having done so, Akane knew she wouldn't be able to get out of this confrontation. Particularly with Nabiki supporting Kasumi. The two of them together never backed down against their little sister - witness how they had given her to Ranma in the first place.<p>Instead, she sighed, swinging her legs around to sit facing her two sisters. "Well, you know, I've been busy with stuff." She toyed with her hair - she had started letting it grow out in the last few weeks, and it was by now down to her neck - fiddling with her hair was a useful distraction at times, even if she didn't like catching herself doing it. Bad habits could drive people away, after all.<p>"Doing what, Akane? You've been searching for Ranma, haven't you? Even after Daddy told you not to." That was Nabiki, as suspicious as Kasumi was concerned. "Of course, you know, now that Daddy's dissolved the arrangement, you could relax, and date some other boys. Ranma will eventually come back, trailing his tail between his legs, once he's worked out whatever's bothering him." 'After I make him grovel a bit for what he's done to you, of course.'<p>"Yeah, and what happens when he does? He's going to come back and find me married off to some loser who conned Daddy into an engagement for food, or else I'm going to be fat, old, and ugly! I am not going to sit down and just let that happen!" Akane made her words a stinging slap in the faces of her sisters.<p>"But, Akane, that doesn't mean you should shut out your family." Kasumi, taking up the challenge.<p>"Yeah, but I don't think any of you understand what it's like. You're just content to sit here, let Daddy tell you what to do, and pretend that everything's normal. Well, it's not. I'm not normal, Ranma's not normal, nothing in this entire city is normal! Closing your eyes to the truth is just stupid!" Akane's charges held nothing back, until she finally overextended herself.<p>"Oh, so we're stupid? But Ukyo isn't, of course. She's so much a better partner than any of your loving family. Because this is all about your precious RANMA. And nobody should act rationally where RANMA is concerned." Nabiki's flurry began as hot jabs and cooled to a chilling punch, straight to Akane's gut.<p>"Nabiki..." Kasumi chided, her conversational stance weakening.<p>"Kasumi, no, it's time to have this out. We've been beating about the bush for weeks now, and she's just been avoiding the issue. Akane, you're absolutely right; closing your eyes to the truth IS stupid. Ranma LEFT you. I don't know exactly why, I don't know where, but he is GONE." Nabiki was in fine form, her stance perfect, her jabs piercing.<p>"You don't know exactly why? But you do have some idea, don't you?" Akane had been making a wild accusation, feeling a need to strike out against Nabiki's words, but then she saw something in her sister's dark eyes. "What do you know, Nabiki? What are you hiding?"<p>Akane's familiar annoyance was starting to crystallize into a even more familiar berserker rage, and Nabiki knew she needed to act quickly if she was going to survive; a few more minutes, and Akane wouldn't be listening to anything anyone said. "Moi, Akane? That's the sort of thing Kasumi and I are talking about, you're lashing out at your friends and family. I, no, we" - she turned to look at Kasumi - "think that maybe you should go in for some counseling next week."<p>"Both of you? Me? Counseling? I can't believe this!" Nabiki gulped. Akane's figure was starting to glow red, as her battle aura came flaming into existence in strict defiance of the laws of nature... this was the sort of fury normally reserved for Ranma's most foolish mistakes, not the sort normal, non-suicidal humans wanted to be in the path of.<p>But Kasumi stood her ground, placid and enduring. "Yes, Akane. And Father. We may not know where Ranma is, and we want to find him just as much as you do, but going around breaking into random people's houses not doing any good. You've been like this for weeks now; people have already started complaining around the neighborhood."<p>Akane knew that Kasumi had a point. The Japanese famously tried to solve problems outside of their court system, so disputes were usually settled through the intervention of neighbors. Most of the people whose houses she had investigated (like the Kunos) were not popular with the surrounding community, to say the least, so if the neighbors were now taking their complaints seriously...<p>Nonetheless, some things were too important to give way to the neighbors' offended pride. "If certain people were willing to help me, maybe we'd have found something by now. But as it is, half the time the people are there waiting for me, making sure I 'be careful'..."  As she spoke, the red around Akane began lightening into a blinding orange, and streaks of yellow were beginning to flare.<p>The waves of pressure being thrown off from her sister's aura made Nabiki stumble back, as she raised her hand to shield her eyes. "You know, some of my customers depend on my services, sis. I couldn't let them down in the lurch..." That wasn't helping; she shut her eyes. That helped some; she could only see a faint glow through her eyelids.<p>No sooner had her words been recognized, then the glow seemed to flare outward, and she was knocked off her feet, to roll down the roof, towards the edge, her fingers scrabbling for purchase, missing any handholds, coming closer... yes!, she managed to lodge her feet against the gutter.<p>"You think this is a time to worry about MONEY! AARRGGH! I HATE YOU!"  With an inarticulate cry of rage, Akane leapt, becoming a sun in the sky, before her shape receded in the distance, marked only by a cascade of falling telephone poles.<p>"Well, I think Akane's is growing stronger," Kasumi smiled, attempting to put the best face on the situation. She strode over to the edge of the roof, and helped Nabiki climb up to a more secure position.<p>"Yeah, you could say that," Nabiki finally managed, after a few minutes to catch her breath. "I think it's a good thing I've got the party tonight; no more family discussions for a while." She began climbing down the ladder, and then felt even more depressed when a thought struck her. 'How did Kasumi stay standing through all that? Am I the only normal one in this family?'<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>An hour or so later, Kasumi and Nabiki were inside the middle Tendo daughter's room, as Nabiki prepared for the night's party. She slipped out of her normal, everyday shorts while looking in the closet for her dress, talking over her shoulder to Kasumi all the while.<p>"Only a few more weeks until I get out of Nerima, finally. You know, it's odd, this summer has been surprisingly peaceful, but it's only whetted my appetite to get away from the Nerima chaos. I mean, we've put up with this all our lives, and now I'm just tired of it. I want out in the real world, to make money, find myself a normal guy who doesn't go berserk over the martial arts, to find myself a normal life!"<p>"Oh, Nabiki. This hasn't been such a bad life, has it? You were happy here, I think." Kasumi stepped over to the closet and picked up an outfit Nabiki had discarded. "Oh, my, this is what Prince Toma gave to you, isn't it? That was such a fun adventure... I hadn't enjoyed myself so much in, hmm..." Kasumi's voice trailed off a bit as she considered.<p>"It was an experience, all right. " Nabiki considered the clothes, then took it back from Kasumi. It was too tame to attract the attention she wanted tonight; the sort of sophisticated party-goer she was stalking were used to flash. Smirking, she stretched out a finger to grab a thin line of black cloth hanging from the closet rod. 'I have to admit, I liked poking things up, but now I'm just tired of it.'<p>"Oh, I never thought you cared much for sashes, Nabiki."<p>"I don't. But dresses, now those I like..." Nabiki's smirk widened, as Kasumi mouth opened in a perfect 'o' of appreciation. "And I definitely want to impress Kuno-chan's guests."<p>"Oh dear, you aren't going after Tatewaki, are you? "<p>"Kuno? I could gag. Why do you think I'd waste my time with him, when there are so many other, less deluded fish in the sea?"<p>Kasumi tilted her head, indicating her seriousness. "Well, with how you've said Tatewaki's settled down these last few months, I was thinking he might help cheer up Akane."<p>Nabiki shook her head, as she started to take off her shirt. "Yeah, he's settled down, sis, but I don't think Akane's going to be warming up to him anytime soon. He's stopped the insane challenges, but he still pesters her to date him at least once a week." Tossing the shirt to the bed, Nabiki walked over to the mirror in the corner, making a final check that she hadn't suddenly sprouted horns or been tattooed by a wandering martial artist.<p>"He still asks her out, even though he's going away soon? How romantic." Kasumi looked wistfully into the distance.<p>'Oh, boy. She's not usually this blind; I think she's getting tired of Tofu's antics. Maybe I'd better offer my assistance soon in landing her catch. But not tonight; tomorrow. I don't want anything distracting me tonight.'<p>"So why /are/ you so excited about this party, Nabiki? That dress looks a bit much, even for you."<p>"Not my fault I'm the one with all the fashion sense in this family, sis. I'm excited because this party is where I'm going to start making contacts for the real world. The more people I impress tonight, the easier life will be after college."<p>"But Nabiki, I thought you had accepted the offer from Kuno Industries."<p>"I'm thinking about it, but if I just jumped into bed with him, there goes all of my leverage. Keep your options open, sis... and speaking of which, that's why you should start dating other people, so Tofu realizes he's got to win you over." 'OK, that's a freebie for tonight, Kasumi. Better take advantage of it.'<p>Kasumi didn't respond, but her cheeks reddened.<p>"Anyway, Kuno may have cleaned up his act recently, but deep down I think he's the same person he's always been. He and I have a lot of history, and I think I want a clean break." 'That way, I can avoid people thinking of me as an Ice Queen forever.'<p>Shooing Kasumi out of her room, Nabiki quickly continued undressing, before beginning the painstaking process of making herself appear casually elegant.<p>She had barely finished, her elaborate hour of work not visible to anyone who didn't closely examine her face, but working to smooth out the few flaws in her natural skin, when she heard the telephone ring.<p>Cursing softly at the interruptions to her plans, she picked up the handset. "Hello, Nabiki speaking. What do you want?"<p>The voice on the other end relieved her irritation. "Nabiki Tendo, your not-entirely-dulcet tone is the angels' choir to me today. But I called simply to inquire whether you were prepared for the limousine to pick you up." Kuno's voice seemed somewhat strained, as if he were physically holding his tongue to stop himself from babbling on about some new development in his rich fantasy life.<p>"Yep, just finished." Nabiki couldn't muster her normal layer of sarcasm in the face of this evening's potential. "I'll be waiting outside for Sasuke in just a minute."<p>Kunos voice was noticeably less joyful. "Actually, I must admit that my loyal retainer is indisposed tonight, and the Kuno family has had to draw upon the services of a rental agency."<p>Nabiki laughed silently to herself at the manifest shame in Kunos voice. Since his reconciliation with his father last month, Kuno had been throwing around his social rank a lot more. She had had more fun tweaking his nose in it the last few weeks than she had the entire previous year - particularly since Kuno had seemed to shake off a large part of his buffoon persona. She actually started being subtle in her mockery, mixing it throughly between layers of innuendo and deceptive speech. It seemed to be working, keeping her mind flexible and sharp when she could easily be dulling it by simply floating through the college entrance exams.<p>That subtlety had paid off quite well, as Kuno relaxed more around her. She hadn't realized just how large the Kuno fortune was until his father called in the Prime Minister, on very short notice, to speak at their graduation. After learning that, she had upgraded the services she provided Kuno by helping him avoid some of the more embarrassing situations that plagued Nerima. And, of course, she had insisted on being handsomely rewarded for that. A promised executive position, if she chose, and an introduction to the elite social circles... exactly what she needed to make her own way in the world.<p>But she was pretty sure she wouldn't take him up on his offer of a position within the Kuno family company. Not only did she want to make a break with her past, she wanted to remain on good terms with her family. It was pretty clear that Ranma had ended up suspecting something about his dates with Kuno; maybe he had started building up a resistance to the drugs, maybe something else had given him a hint. Once he had worked off his rage and disgust, he would be back for Akane. It's certainly a good idea to not alienate her future brother-in-law any more than necessary. 'And that's the one predictable thing about Ranma,' Nabiki thought, 'he'll never stay down for long when Akane's involved.'<p>But back to trolling the fish. "Oh, I'm sure your impressive offer will guarantee good service," Nabiki purred in response to Kuno, before making her excuses and hanging up. She burst out giggling, at that. 'Get a hold of yourself, Nabiki. There's no guarantee how this night will turn out. And besides, maybe you will take that job after all.'<p>She slipped out of her room, almost skipping down the stairs, and out the door to wait for her ride, not hearing as the phone began ringing again.<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>Akane hopped from rooftop to rooftop, trying to regain her control. The air around her, heavy with her dark emotions, noticeably slowed her down, probably the only reason she wasn't already outside of the city limits.<p>As she came to a park, Akane descended to the ground, and among the peace of the trees, began to unclench her fists. She had lived with her sisters for years, and knew what they were trying to do. 'They just don't understand Ranma, though; they never really adjusted to what his life is like, since they stayed out of most of it.' Her thoughts continued in this bitter vein, until she came to the lake that resided at the center of the park. There she knelt and began the slow, deliberate process of meditation, opening herself to the world as she contemplated the periodic ripples in the water.<p>Had she not opened up her senses, she would have missed the two shadowy figures slinking out of the wooded areas behind her back. But she did, and quickly without hurrying rose to her feet, pivoting to face them, alert and ready.<p>Her alertness proved wasted as the taller of the two stretched up and waved. "Hey, Akane! We've been looking all over for you, sugar!" The two figures came bounding over to the lake, before finally coming to a stop directly in front of Akane.<p>"Oh, hey, Ukyo." Even to Akane's ears, that sounded flat. The meditation didn't seem to have left her at peace, just tired. "Any luck on the search?" Had she truly had any hope for Ukyo's search, she would have been excited, but as it was...<p>Akane wasn't surprised that Ukyo looked excited. Ukyo was relentlessly optimistic in everything she did; by the second week after Ranma's disappearance, she had assumed Ranma was stuck in the neko-ken, and had promptly hijacked a milk truck and spent a week haunting animal shelters, the parks, and people's backyards. She didn't give up until after the Animal Control tranquilized her, and promised to step up their own patrols to look for a human who thinks he's a cat. But after that, she just stopped worrying about it; no real regrets, just on to the next plan with as much enthusiasm as ever: conducting a house-to-house search of the entire ward. And if that failed, she'd probably go on to the rest of Japan.<p>Akane was surprised, however, to see that Shampoo's face bright and cheery. The lavender-haired Amazon, when finally convinced that the other fiancees were not holding Ranma captive somewhere to prevent his marriage to her, had become a grim-faced huntress in pursuit of Ranma. Her shakedown of the local dojos in pursuit of clues had been entertaining. Well, at least for most onlookers, if not the dojos' masters (the Martial Arts Aromatherapy had resulted in two city blocks reeking of lemon-grass for a week and a half, but many of the audience had decided that fiasco was was more than made up for by the Martial Arts Massage challenge).<p>Shampoo was visibly bouncing on her toes. "Akane, I just now back from China. I have compass to find Ranma! We go..."<p>"WHAT!" Akane found her nose suddenly pressed to Shampoo's. "What's this about China?" Shampoo was off the ground, that was odd. "What's this about Ranma?" And Shampoo was having trouble trouble breathing. What was going on?<p>Suddenly Ukyo swung her spatula, knocking Akane away from Shampoo. "Stop it! She'll tell you IN A MINUTE!"<p>'Oh, that was what was going on.' Akane slid backwards, into the lake, and briefly floundered in the shallow water.<p>"What'd you do _that_ for?" Akane yelled, realizing that she could sit in the water with no fear of drowning.<p>"Akane, you're being ridiculous. Shampoo was about to tell you about her compass before you lost it." Ukyo calmly held out her spatula so that Akane could grab a hold of it and clamber sullenly to her feet.<p>"Is ok. She always like that." Shampoo's good humor had apparently been completely restored by her trip to China. "Great-grandmother and I go to China last week, fought tribe for Compass of Location. I won, and now, we find Ranma!" Shampoo reached into the neckline of her silk pant-suit, removing a large golden compass on a metal necklace, until now hidden beneath her hair. She cupped it protectively while tilting her hands so that Akane could see it.<p>"A compass? How is that going to help us? We know what direction north is!" Akane was disgusted. She had briefly seen an end to her search, but Shampoo was either playing the bimbo role to the hilt, or mocking her. Neither one was appreciated where Ranma was concerned. "Come on, Ukyo, let's go back to searching. Maybe we'll find some trace of him at the Japanese Nannichuan."<p>Ukyo remained standing, settling a serious gaze on Akane. "Akane, listen to Shampoo for once. This is too important for our feuds." There was no hesitation in Ukyo's voice, no trace of the cunning that she sometimes exhibited when trying to manipulate her rivals. "Shampoo, show her what it can do."<p>Shampoo closed her eyes, and began murmuring under her breath. The compass began glowing, lighting up the area. The entire scene began to feel hyper-realistic to Akane - she felt like she could count the threads of silk in Shampoo's outfit, see every dimple that years of pounding had beaten into Ukyo's spatula, feel the separate pulses of her blood as the various valves in her heart closed and opened - and then Shampoo opened her eyes and said one recognizable word, her high-pitched voice ineffably deeper and resonating: "Ranma."<p>The gold of the compass seemed to gather itself into a ball, and then spread out, forming a ray as it shot across the lake and into the town. Akane could only watch dumbfounded with her heightened senses as it seemed to descend on a particular block in the rich section of town, and then highlighting one familiar estate.<p>The beam slowly faded, taking with it the hypersenses, and in the now ill-focused reality Akane looked around at the other two. "What was that beam? Did it just show us where Ranma is?"<p>"Aiyah," Shampoo softly said. "It ancient treasure of the Joketzusoku. How I track Ranma to Japan years ago. Should never never be brought away from village; but I challenge for it, I win. It always shows the truth; Ranma is at end of the beam." From some hidden cache in the park, Shampoo must have drawn her weapons; she placed a bow on the ground before her, and began inspecting a sword, making sure it was ready for use.<p>Ukyo walked stiffly away from the other two, stepping right at the edge of the lake, gazing at the ripples. She started a low-voiced litany, obviously not expecting a response. "You remember when we were in that area, don't you, Akane? There was a party, but people were leaving; they had been expecting us, somehow, and didn't want to risk the social faux pas of confronting us directly. Then we got a guided tour, before their bodyguards asked us to leave. And we left. It didn't feel right, but we left; they were open, they were agreeable, they were forewarned, they tricked us, they tricked us, the Kunos tricked us!" By the end Ukyo was shouting, and sobbing, and swinging her spatula in the air, surely decapitating any invisible ninja who might have been creeping up on her.<p>Akane was in little better condition, but she managed to step up to Ukyo and rest her hand on Ukyo's shoulder. "I remember, Ukyo. But we don't know it's them yet. There could be some reasonable explanation. And if there isn't..." Akane stopped; there was no need to go further.<p>Shampoo slipped her sword into a scabbard tied around her waist, and picked up the bow. "No time to talk. We go now." She resolutely turned and began slipping towards the trees.<p>"No," Akane softly said, her mind still clouded by emotion but determined for once not to let her strategy be dictated by that. "I've got a bad feeling about this. First, let me call the dojo, and..." Akane swallowed. "...get some help."<p>Ukyo had stopped, and then her expression firmed. "Yes, and then we'll see Ranchan, no matter what!"<p>- = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =<p>Author's notes: Wow, this has been a while. Some people manage to throw out an incredible chapter every few weeks, it seems; but I manage to take half a year to crank this out :-) My thanks to the brave people who sent me encouragement and feedback on the previous chapter. I'm no longer holding to my previous estimate of there being 3 chapters in total; my current guess is at least 5, but I'm not committing any money to it.<p>This chapter is very much a 'setting things up' chapter. I tried to 'show, not tell', but I'd appreciate feedback on that (even if it's just a simple YES or NO, although more details would be certainly appreciated). As always, any and all comments, including flames, lampooning, MSTing, and cash money is appreciated.
