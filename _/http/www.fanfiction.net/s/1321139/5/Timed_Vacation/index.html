</div>1<br/>December 13, 1997<br/>12:30 PM<p>Brrrrrrrrrrrrriiinnngg– bop.<p>There's nothing quite like the pleasure of waking up late on a weekend, thought Setsuna.<p>There's ample time to play around with the "snooze" button on the alarm clock – an act<br/>that she found almost addicting by now, and more than enough time to simply snuggle<br/>into the blankets and pretend that she was still sleeping. An odd image of a polar bear<br/>floated into her mind as she pulled the sheets over her head once more, and Setsuna<br/>pictured herself hibernating like the warm, furry animal deep inside a cave where the<br/>wintry gales and biting frost outside could not reach her.<p>Unfortunately, however, the dutiful and more responsible part of her mind informed her<br/>that while this was technically weekend time, it was also still a Saturday. And Saturdays<br/>meant taking Minako around for photo shoots at three-thirty in the afternoon.<p>She was not looking forward to the challenge.<p>Minako, in Setsuna's opinion, was a work in progress at best. If her road to stardom<br/>could be called a road at all, she supposed that it would have to have been one of those<br/>tiny dirt paths winding into the Amazonian rainforests that only the aborigines would<br/>dare to venture. Unfortunately, the budding teenager was clearly not an indigenous South<br/>American tribe member. She was tripping so often over every little tree branch and rock<br/>on her way through the metaphorical jungle that it was a torture to watch at times. On<br/>several occasions, Setsuna found herself waiting on the set or studio ten minutes after the<br/>shoot had begun, only to find the girl joyfully marching from the entrance with yet<br/>another autograph on the back of one of her innumerable photo collections of her idols.<br/>And she would have to endure through the tirade as Minako ecstatically described in<br/>detail how lucky she was to just accidentally bump into the adolescent heartthrob when<br/>she took a break to grab some sweets from the vending machine downstairs, or ran into<br/>the boy and his agent in the parking lot just as they were leaving after a photo session.<p>An especially memorable example came when once, forty-five minutes past the<br/>scheduled starting time of the shoot, Setsuna had to leave the studio to track her protégé<br/>down, finding her in the backstage of a boy-band concert held five blocks away. That<br/>time, Minako had a photo out in one hand and a bus ticket transfer in the other, and her<br/>eyes were those of a predatory stalker as she waited in a shadowy corner near the<br/>entrance, ready to pounce on the boys as soon as they arrived. She had to be dragged<br/>back into the studio that time, and her screams of outrage could be heard even over the<br/>amplified speakers as the cheesy love songs played on.<p>They really should have hired a babysitter instead.<p>On a more pleasant note, however, Saotome-san had gradually become more open to<br/>conversation over the past month. Now, more often than not, the two of them would talk<br/>late into the night about how their days went, even if he still refused to tell her why she<br/>sometimes found him completely soaked to the bone coming back home when there<br/>hadn't been a drop of rain outside that day.<p>To put it simply, the pigtailed young man was growing on her, and she was discovering<br/>that his music was increasingly pleasant to her ears as well despite her minimal interest in<br/>music in general, or his claim that he was only practicing and not playing for her in<br/>particular. In turn, she talked about her problems at work, and he would patiently sit,<br/>either behind the piano or on the couch next to her own, listening to her complaints until<br/>she had vented through her frustrations. It was like talking to the Gate back on Pluto, she<br/>discovered, but much better, because neither the Gate nor the ever-flowing Time Stream<br/>would appear to be sympathetic to her cause or commiserate with her.<p>For instance, Setsuna vividly recalled when, a week ago, they had somehow touched on<br/>the subject of how they had met their respective fiancées at first…<p>x x x<p>"–and then, she clonked me over the head with a table," said Ranma with a casual shrug.<p>"…you're kidding me, right?"<p>"Naah. I wish. What about you? How did you run into Takuya?"<p>She thought for a moment with her head back over the cushion of the sofa, before<br/>straightening herself, tucking her legs and crossing them underneath her, sitting up in<br/>semi-Indian style. "Well, it's nothing quite as extreme as your first meeting," she started.<br/>"In fact, it was really lame."<p>"Really lame?" He echoed.<p>"Yeah," she continued, the memory coming to her even as she spoke, "I was moping<br/>around inside a café after finishing up another crap-assignment, and all of a sudden this<br/>guy in a tux just walked up to me, looked at me with those blue eyes like yours, and said,<br/>"Hey, you look kinda familiar. Do I know you?" And I rolled my eyes like this and<br/>thought, boy, is he for real? That's the lamest pick-up line I've ever heard in my life."<p>"That was pretty dorky," he agreed with a laugh.<p>"Wasn't it? But somehow I kept running into him everywhere; for a while I thought he<br/>was stalking me or something. And, before I knew what happened, we just started going<br/>out."<p>He thought about that for a moment and nodded. "Yeah, I can see how he could say<br/>something like that. It sounded pretty much like him." Then, with a gleam in his eyes,<br/>he asked, "Did I ever tell you how I met Takuya?"<p>"No, how?"<p>"See," he reminisced, "I had just left Nerima that day and was feeling kinda down, and<br/>somehow I'd walked all the way to Juuban without really knowing or caring where I was<br/>heading. And I was walking down this big street when all of a sudden I heard this loud<br/>horn blaring like there was no tomorrow. I looked up and saw him standing in the middle<br/>of the intersection like a road-kill, and then I saw that an SUV was going to run him over<br/>in the next two seconds if he didn't move – which he didn't look like he was going to –<br/>so I tackled his ass and brought him over to the divider." He laughed again at the thought<br/>of that. "I was like, geez, what the hell was this dork thinking, standing around like that?<br/>Then he told me he was going to treat me to dinner for rescuing him, and since it was free<br/>food I didn't turn it down." He paused briefly and shrugged even as she laughed.<p>"We talked a little over dinner, and it turned out that he was new to the town himself and<br/>was looking for an apartment, and he was kind of lost and didn't know where to go when<br/>he stopped at the intersection. He asked me if I knew of any places that were for rent,<br/>and when I said that I didn't know, and that I didn't have a place to stay either, he just<br/>told me that I could stay with him when he got a place to settle down. Actually," he<br/>amended a little later, "Takuya was really insistent on that, and I was like, whatever,<br/>since I really couldn't care either way at the time…"<p>"…And then?" She turned to face him expectantly after seeing that he had trailed off<br/>once more.<p>"…and then he ended up renting this apartment that day, and I moved into the other<br/>room. It was pretty easy for me, since all I had at the time was my backpack," he<br/>finished.<p>She smiled wanly. "Takuya was always a nice guy. A little rough around the edges, but<br/>still a nice guy nonetheless."<p>He shrugged again. "I guess. He did get me into playing the piano though."<p>"Oh?"<p>"Yeah. Said he used to be a musician, and he saw I had some pretty quick hands when I<br/>got him out of that jam. So he suggested that since I wasn't doing anything at the time, I<br/>might as well try to play the piano, and that it was a good art. And I did; it was a hobby<br/>at first, but I didn't really expect how easy it was for me to memorize the pieces that I<br/>came across. Pretty soon I got to the point where I got really into it and started playing<br/>everyday, and when I went to a music store one day to look for some books on classical<br/>music I played a little tune on one of their baby-grands just for fun, and a professor from<br/>Gedai who was there at the time flagged me down after I finished and asked me to<br/>consider applying to the school. So that's how I got in." He stopped and turned to stare<br/>at her with a curious expression on his face. "Say, Meiou-san?"<p>"Hmm?" Sometime during his tale, she had gone back to reclining against the couch, her<br/>hands folded under the side of her cheek as she leaned her head against one of the<br/>armrests.<p>"Do you miss him?"<p>"…Yes," she said honestly. "I miss him a lot."<p>"Do you… hate him?"<p>She sat up at that, and thought hard for a response. "Yes. No. I don't know," she said<br/>finally. "It's hard to love someone for a year and want to rip his guts out all of a sudden;<br/>not when you start to remember all the good memories you had with that person. Like<br/>now."<p>He nodded, but didn't say anything further after that.<p>x x x<p>And it was true, Setsuna found in retrospect. Sometime during that night, she found that<br/>she no longer had the same burning hatred for Takuya that she did before. It wasn't quite<br/>enough for her to forgive him, but she didn't feel like she had to shy away from thinking<br/>about him for fear that she would be consumed with rage. And with each mention of<br/>Takuya's name, and each peal of laughter she shared with Saotome-san, Setsuna felt the<br/>pain she associated with her old fiancée becoming more and more distant. In time, she<br/>thought, it may even fade away like all other memories she had and become nothing<br/>except a haze of –<p>Brrrriiiiiiiiinnnng-riiing-ring-rriiiiiinnnggg.<p>Oh well, her reveries interrupted by the ringing of the alarm clock, Setsuna sighed under<br/>the blankets and snuck a hand up to pull them to the sides, it's about time to get up<br/>anyway.<p>.<br/>2<br/>December 13, 1997<br/>1:18 PM<p>It was almost the same routine.<p>Open door. Put the jingling keys back into pocket. Close door. Step out of the shoes,<br/>bend down, and place the shoes in the corner by the foyer. And walk into the room.<p>Oops.<p>Almost forgot the hop.<p>He paused, one foot hanging four inches above the ground, and adjusted his stride,<br/>cleanly avoiding the spot where his foot was going to land. It'd been almost a month<br/>now, but he still had to remind himself that Setsuna had placed a sticky board for<br/>cockroaches near the entrance. Not to mention the two she put in the kitchen, next to the<br/>sink, or the one against the bit of wall between the kitchen and his bedroom door. Or the<br/>four behind the couch in the living room. Or the two behind the toilet in the bathroom.<br/>The woman had turned the apartment into a virtual deathtrap for cockroaches ever since<br/>the day she found one on her bed, and he nearly fell onto the floor laughing at the sight of<br/>the ring of traps she had made around her room. According to the manuals he read, the<br/>amount of sticky boards she had placed in the apartment could have easily taken care of<br/>an outbreak in an area the size of an airplane hanger. The thing is, whenever he tried to<br/>ask her where exactly on the bed the thing had been when she woke up, she would just<br/>clam up immediately and walk away.<p>Ranma shrugged helplessly. Never could understand girls.<p>He had just made his way past the piano when the bathroom door on his left opened. A<br/>wave of steam wafted out into the living room, and Setsuna walked out with a damp<br/>towel wrapped around her hair, wearing nothing except a white, oversized T-shirt with a<br/>picture of the Powerpuff Girls on it.<p>"Good morning," she said, not looking up, her bare feet making wet prints on the floor as<br/>she fell into the sofa with a sigh. Ranma returned the greeting distractedly and sat down<br/>on his couch, starting to sort the mail he just got from downstairs.<p>"Anything new?" She asked, holding the white towel with a hand and draping the back<br/>cushion with the other. "Ooh, news." She leaned forward and snatched the papers right<br/>out of his hands just as he was about to read them. Pausing, he turned to gaze at her with<br/>a bit of irritation, then decided to just drop the matter and went back to browsing the rest<br/>of the mail. He'd gotten used of this kind of stuff by now anyway.<p>"Hmm… what's this?" Setsuna's voice drifted off into the background as he went<br/>through each piece of mail from the small stack in his lap, starting with the electricity<br/>bill. "…Mysterious sickness strikes again… doctors were once more unable to discern<br/>the reason for the four new victims who fell into a coma yesterday and taken to the<br/>Nisseki Medical Center…" Next was a donation request from some charity organization.<br/>He made a sour face. "…And a tragedy occurred late in the evening last night, as a<br/>young woman was run over by an 18-wheeler while she was picking up spare change in<br/>the middle of a road outside the Roppongi station…" Next was the water bill.<br/>"…woman was identified as Takako Ryoko, a twenty-one-year-old tour guide working<br/>for the…" His fingers rested on a postcard that seemed out of place. He picked it up and<br/>flipped the card over to see where it came from, then immediately stuffed the card<br/>underneath the other letters and stood up from the sofa.<p>Setsuna took note of his sudden movement and stopped reading. "What are you doing?"<p>"Um," he faltered, "I, uh, I'm just going back to my room, why?"<p>She eyed him suspiciously. "What's that in your hand then?"<p>He hid the hand holding the stack of mail behind his back, and headed for his room<br/>without bothering to reply.<p>"Wait, give me that!" She threw the papers aside and rose up to intercept him; the towel<br/>fell by the wayside and damp green hair tumbled down her back as she lunged. She<br/>managed to catch an arm just before he could open the bedroom door. "It's from<br/>Yamaguchi, isn't it?" Her eyes bore into his in accusation.<p>"No, it's just the bills."<p>"I don't believe you!"<p>He turned his back to her and tried to get to the door, but Setsuna tackled him from<br/>behind and reached around his waist with her right hand to take the mail. Ranma<br/>struggled even more when he realized that something soft and supple was mashing into<br/>his back, making his skin quiver and his face flush. At last, her fingers caught a piece of<br/>the postcard at the bottom of the stack, and realizing that this must be what he was trying<br/>to hide, she pulled on it with all her might.<p>The postcard tore into two pieces, and she stumbled away from him due to the<br/>momentum of her force, nearly falling onto the ground. She glared at Ranma for a<br/>second, then trained her eyes on the part of the card in her hands.<p>It wasn't the gold rims framing the card that she cared about. It wasn't the tiny pink<br/>hearts glued all over the card that she cared about either, or that the post stamp on the<br/>corner told her the card came from America. What she cared about was what was written<br/>on it:<p>"From… Takuya and Tri–" she read to herself and broke off when the last part was<br/>missing, then continued on to the next line. "…Great News!" And the line after that.<br/>"…We're getting m–" That was as much as she find, but her mind had figured out the<br/>rest of the message.<p>He eyed her with a sinking feeling in his stomach, already knowing the content by heart.<br/>"M…?"<p>Setsuna gawked at the text for a long time. "M…Ma…Ma…Married?" She shrieked<br/>suddenly, the hand holding the card trembling as her grip on it tightened, draining the<br/>color from her knuckles until they turned as pale as her face.<p>Ranma bit on his lower lip and turned away.<p>"Married…" she breathed, unwanted tears welling in her eyes.<p>Unable to bear the note of desolation in her voice, Ranma thought fast and hard and tried<br/>to remember what little he could from old English lessons with Hinako-sensei, berating<br/>himself all the while for falling asleep in her class every time. Finally, he found an<br/>alternative. "Um," he swallowed a little more, then told the lie. "It… it could be<br/>'murdered', you know?" He suggested.<p>Tears and message nearly forgotten for an instant, Setsuna looked up at him in surprise.<br/>Then her anger exploded.<p>"Who the hell would send a postcard telling people that they're getting MURDERED?"<br/>She screamed as she marched towards him, hands held at her sides and balling into small<br/>fists. "And with little pink hearts glued onto the background no less!" Then, locking<br/>onto the other piece of the card still in his hand and realizing that she could settle the<br/>matter with it instantly, Setsuna made a dive for it again.<p>"Gimme that!" She yelled in frenzy, grabbing onto the hand holding the bit of postcard.<br/>Then, before she could bring both her hands around again to wrestle the shred away from<br/>his fingers, he crumpled the thing in his palm, opened his mouth, and promptly<br/>swallowed the ball of paper. Lips parting silently, she stared at him in shock, a finger<br/>waving and pointing at him in the air.<p>Then, suddenly, her legs gave out on her, and like a puppet with its strings cut, she fell to<br/>the ground in a boneless heap. "No…" she whispered, then looked up hatefully when<br/>Ranma squeezed past her and walked into the kitchen.<p>"What are you doing?" asked Setsuna, disheartened, devastated, still a tiny bit curious.<p>He came back out with a glass of water in his hand and took a swill. "I've had to eat a lot<br/>of bad cooking in my life," he said, swallowing, "but I've never had paper. I'm just<br/>trying to chug it down with water." He upended the glass, and his expression turned<br/>thoughtful. "Hmm," he informed her at last, "not bad. Tastes like chocolate."<p>.<p>.<br/>TIMED VACATION<p>.<br/>Chapter Four<p>Opening Theme: Close to You (Instrumental)<br/>Composed by: CAGNET<p>.<br/>3<br/>December 13, 1997<br/>3:37 PM<p>In front of her, there were lights.<p>Between the lights, towards the center, there was the camera. Shutters were pressed,<br/>pressed, and pressed some more. The photographer coaxed, coerced, grimaced, smiled,<br/>pulled out a few strands of flaky hair and nearly kicked away the tripod holding the<br/>camera, then finally went back to coaxing the subject inside the view of the camera lens<br/>once again.<p>In front of her, to the distant, there was the backdrop: a picture of a western-styled<br/>redbrick house with a fat, snow-tipped chimney and a sloped roof that was equally laden<br/>in fluffy white against the black canvas that was the night.<p>In front of the backdrop, a young girl posed in a Santa-getup in which the only thing that<br/>kept to the original was the red hat and the large white bag over the shoulder. The rest of<br/>the outfit, from the extra-tight, traffic-stopping red leather corset with its front lace<br/>ending just above a bare navel, to the matching low-rise, high-cut leather shorts with<br/>white-rimmed edges and just a hint of lace shown behind the top of the front zip-line, and<br/>all the way down to the red cowboy boots with six-inch lace-up shafts and padded collars,<br/>would have Santa wheeled into a hospital for frostbites and hypothermia within ten<br/>minutes had he been able to wear it to work.<p>In front of her, bathed in the lights, there was Minako: light-blue-eyed, long-blond-<br/>haired, doing photos for a cell-phone advertisement in a costume just a tad less revealing<br/>than those on the cover of a special Christmas edition of Playboy.<p>Normally, in cases like this, Setsuna would have been jumping up and down, waving her<br/>arms about frantically, smacking a palm into her forehead, or doing anything to clue her<br/>protégé on the set to fix that smile of hers that was making her look like she just went<br/>through root canal. Or Setsuna would have been performing the various poses on the<br/>sidelines to match the those that Minako had been asked to posture – winking, strutting,<br/>jutting her hips, or blowing a kiss to an imaginary recipient – to show the young girl how<br/>modeling was not the same as imitating a dilapidated tree. She would have even bothered<br/>to think up some sharp comments to reflect how today, unlike most days, Minako was<br/>displaying all the hyperactive energy of a sloth trying to take a dump after accidentally<br/>eating some hard and knobby twigs.<p>Then, after the painful session was over, she would have chided the girl about the various<br/>small cuts and bruises on her limbs that the makeup artists had to dress over, and Minako<br/>would probably have shot back about how she could take care of herself perfectly fine,<br/>and that it was healthy for a teenage girl to be as involved in sports as she was. In the<br/>end, Setsuna would have come back to the office, marched straight to her boss's office to<br/>complain about how the company was exploiting children by agreeing to let Minako wear<br/>the flimsy outfit she had on, and her boss would have just shrugged with a look on his<br/>face that said, "What do you expect?"<p>Instead, all Setsuna did was sit in her chair, a fair distance to the side and behind the<br/>photographer, watching Minako flounder around and nearly drop the cell-phone in her<br/>hand several times – and looking straight past her.<p>A photo session, even one with Minako in it, could go by amazingly fast when you're<br/>still in shock.<p>.<br/>4<br/>December 13, 1997<br/>3:37 PM<p>"Saotome-san!" A voice called out to him as he walked out of the building. He turned.<p>"Oh, Sensei." He looked at the man who was holding the glass door open. Same old<br/>dusty English suit, same old brown tie hanging down the pressed oxford shirt, and same<br/>old dark eyes that shone a kind light from behind the glasses. "Staying late again today?"<p>The man shook his head as he let the arm drop and the door close behind him. "Actually,<br/>packing and cleaning up my office before the winter break hits is more like it. I just saw<br/>you leaving when I was taking some empty boxes out of the room." He laughed with a<br/>bit of embarrassment. Then, in a more delicate tone, "Did you figure out what I meant by<br/>expressing your feelings through songs yet?"<p>Ranma thought hard. "Just a little," he said at last. "I've tried a lot lately, but I still can't<br/>see the difference. Is it really that noticeable?"<p>The professor looked down at the ground, a thumb rubbing against the fingers on one<br/>hand. "Think of it like an invisible wall," he looked up after a minute and said. "You<br/>can't touch it, and you can't break it down with your fists because it's not really there.<br/>But when you play a song without any emotions, the audience feels like you've erected a<br/>wall between you and them, and they can't get the full experience of the songs that way."<br/>Pausing again, he sighed, adjusting the glasses a little. "I'm not sure if I'm explaining it<br/>correctly, or if I'm just confusing you even more."<p>"No, it's all right, Sensei," Ranma replied haltingly, chewing his lips, "I think… I think<br/>I'll think about this some more."<p>The older man nodded. "Keep at it." He looked at his watch. "Well, I better head back<br/>to clean up then. Break through that wall, Saotome-san!" Then he turned around and<br/>headed back to the door.<p>Ranma stayed and watched as the professor went inside the building once more. Then,<br/>suddenly, he remembered something he had wanted to ask the man for a while now.<br/>"Um, sensei?"<p>The man halted and looked over his shoulder. "Yes, Saotome-san?"<p>"When did you start wearing glasses anyway?"<p>Startled, the professor took a moment before replying. "Oh, this?" He grinned. "Why<br/>do you ask?"<p>"Um… my old roommate used to have a pair just like those," Ranma said, pointing.<p>"Ah. I doubt it," the older man chortled, taking the pair of thin glasses off his face and<br/>holding them out in front of him to give his student a better look. "This pair's fake," he<br/>continued. "There's really no power behind the lenses. My girlfriend just thought I'd<br/>look cool with glasses, so I bought myself a pair the other day." Then, still laughing, he<br/>turned and walked away.<p>x x x<p>On the sidewalk, a few blocks away from the campus, Ranma stopped in front of an<br/>intersection, waiting for the light to turn green. While he waited, the conversation he had<br/>with his sensei earlier returned to the surface of his mind. He had to hand it to the man,<br/>though; not many people could make him do a double-take like that outside Nerima.<p>He thought back to the earlier parts of their talk, and stayed on the side of the road even<br/>as the light turned. Heedless of the few passers-by walking past him, he closed his eyes<br/>and focused. An invisible wall, his sensei's voice seemed to drift into his ears and<br/>reminded him. Break through that wall.<p>Faster than lightning, Ranma let loose a punch. Straight, precise, deadly.<p>It did not connect.<p>He let his eyes open slowly and lowered the fist, before bringing it up again to examine<br/>the clenched fingers. They held the same power as before. Whatever, he decided finally,<br/>still looking at his hand, just when someone called his name from across the street.<p>"R…Ranma?"<p>That voice. He'd recognize it anywhere. He looked up instantly.<p>Eyes wide, lips open, bangs parting in the breeze, standing not thirty-feet away: Akane.<p>Her hair's longer now, he realized, right as she spun and took off in the opposite<br/>direction.<p>.<br/>5<br/>December 13, 1997<br/>4:02 PM<p>There's a whole lot of nothing you can say to someone you haven't seen for more than a<br/>year, Ranma discovered.<p>The coffee shop was of a modest size, mostly consisting of a lengthy bar-like counter<br/>inside, and a single row of four-seat booths lining along a file of glass windows. The<br/>décor was simple and clean, but not overly cheap, as the pinewood flooring and walls<br/>could attest to.<p>When the two of them had arrived a few minutes ago, the shop was nearly full with the<br/>afternoon rush – mostly company employees just finished with work, or students wishing<br/>for a snack before heading to cram schools. He had followed Akane all the way to the<br/>corner, and took his seat only after she had taken hers.<p>Ranma could detect the faint aroma of coffee lingering in the air like an aftertaste, joined<br/>by the scent of tea, hot cream, and freshly-baked pastries. Out of the corner of his eyes<br/>he witnessed a couple in the booth to his left busily sharing a glass of lemonade with two<br/>straws. He could tell, from noise and smell, that the person sitting at his back was letting<br/>his espresso cool and reading newspapers. Two booths over and behind, he learned from<br/>a group of gossipy teenage girls that some wimpy guy called Yoshikawa from class three-<br/>four went to a summer-festival at night with some girl named Uehara. There was a lot of<br/>giggling and table-slapping as the information was dispensed, discredited, and debated.<br/>And, throughout all this, he could not find a word to say to the girl sitting three feet away,<br/>opposite to him, with her back to the wall.<p>By now, the couple to his left had abandoned the pretense of the shared drink, and, with<br/>their eyes closed, inched their heads forward and prodded on towards the center of the<br/>table where an intangible dividing line lay. They seemed to cross that divider in the air at<br/>the same time, connected, and tasted the sweet lemon on each other's lips. In contrast,<br/>Ranma shifted backward into his seat, and Akane did the same, their heads down. It was<br/>like an interrogation scene at a police station, except that on both sides of the table sat the<br/>suspects, and the cop was missing.<p>Akane put the time they spent not conversing to good use by studying her cup of coffee.<br/>She examined first the ear of the cup, then the etchings on the sides, then the plate<br/>underneath the cup, and finally found the spiraling cream in the coffee fascinating and<br/>chose to make it a thesis.<p>In the meantime, Ranma noted the color of the beverage in his glass gradually taking on a<br/>lighter tinge, and saw the straw with the chew-marks on the end. He wiped off some of<br/>the condensation on the glass with a wet hand, looking like someone who just found out<br/>that this was not his cup of tea, in more ways than one.<p>He did, however, utter the first word since their arrival just before the ice-cubes in his<br/>drink had completely melted. "Um…"<p>"Yes?" Akane interjected at once, looking up from her cup.<p>"How's everyone doing?" He brought his head up as well, just to catch her stiffen<br/>slightly and avert her gaze to the side.<p>"They're fine." She said tersely. "Kasumi's still in the house, Nabiki's still at college<br/>studying finance – but you knew that already. I'm not sure about your folks because,<br/>well, Dad wasn't happy after you just up and left that night, so…" she fidgeted and<br/>trailed off, but he got the idea anyway.<p>"And you?"<p>"…I'm attending Keio. Probably going into sports management or something along the<br/>line."<p>"Ah." He nodded, and took a deep breath. "Listen, Akane, about that day –" he began.<p>"It's not your fault." she cut in again just as fast as before. "You did the right thing.<br/>Listen," she said, rising from her seat, "I've gotta run, Ranma. I was going to meet up<br/>with a friend, and I'm late already." She picked up her backpack from the empty seat<br/>next to her and hooked the straps over her shoulders. "Thanks for the coffee."<p>"Wait!" He grabbed her by the wrist and held her back. She looked back at him,<br/>shoulder-length brown hair spilling as her head turned. He took time to note that she had<br/>light makeup on her face, and stood a little taller than he remembered. The yellow and<br/>green sweater under her coat was something he'd never seen her wear either. "You look<br/>different," he said softly, searching to make contact with her eyes. He failed.<p>"…I've changed," Akane said with a smile that could be called uplifting only if she was<br/>suffering from clinical depression. Then she did a quick inspection of him in return.<br/>"You still look the same."<p>"I know." Rising as well, and still not releasing her wrist, Ranma swallowed hard, and<br/>forced the words out of his mouth with a ferocity that surprised even himself. "Can I –"<br/>he started, then switched the question and his tone. "Can we talk again?"<p>"I –" Akane started to shake her head, but took note of the hand still attached to her wrist.<br/>She struggled for a moment, sighed, and at last gave the barest hint of a nod. "Not at the<br/>dojo though," she stated firmly.<p>"Here?" He offered, and she nodded again after a bit. "Next… Saturday night?"<br/>Another slight nod. "Eight-o'clock, then," he said swiftly. She did not refuse.<p>Ranma let go of her hand, and watched her almost flee out of the store. He found it<br/>ironic that asking her out would be so much easier only after he had left her, and would<br/>have laughed at himself if he didn't find the taste of irony insipid, just like the watered-<br/>down ice tea still left mostly untouched in his glass.<p>.<br/>6<br/>December 13, 1997<br/>6:18 PM<p>"I'm home," Ranma called out customarily as he stepped through the doorway. The light<br/>was on in the living room, but there was no answer. He looked down, started to count,<br/>and then realized that he really couldn't tell whether Setsuna was home yet by the<br/>number of shoes on the floor.<p>He walked into the living room. Sure enough, there was Setsuna sitting primly on her<br/>couch, hands on her knees, looking straight ahead at some fixed spot on her bedroom<br/>door.<p>Ranma sat down on the left end of his sofa, and scooted forward. He waved a hand in<br/>front of her face. "Hello?"<p>Setsuna blinked. "Oh, you're back," she said, not really paying him attention.<p>He snorted. "You noticed," he said. Then, after a pause, he added, more calmly, "I saw<br/>Akane today."<p>It only took five seconds for Setsuna to respond this time. Brought out of her trance, she<br/>turned to him, hesitating as she asked. "You mean… your old fiancée?" Seeing a tired<br/>nod, she continued inquisitively. "What happened?"<p>"Nothing," he said, holding a hand to his forehead and running it up through his hair.<br/>"We barely talked at all. It was as awkward as you can get." He sighed. "I don't know<br/>what came over me in the end though, asking her to meet me like that… but, I guess,<br/>we're going to see each other again next weekend."<p>Setsuna nodded. "Do you… miss her?" She asked slowly.<p>Are you kidding? That kawaikune tomboy… "I guess," he said honestly, after realizing<br/>that there was no point to lie. "Yes."<p>Setsuna nodded again, a finger to her lips. This conversation was too much like déjà vu,<br/>she decided, but went ahead with the question anyway. "Do you… love her?" She asked<br/>again, even more carefully this time, as if she was trying to wade through a minefield<br/>without a detector.<p>Ranma's whole body went rigid. "I –" he began, but fell silent again. He looked down at<br/>the ground. "…Yes. No. I don't know anymore," he confessed. "I just locked up when<br/>I saw her, and I don't even know what I'm going to say to her when I see her next week,"<br/>he said agitatedly, but calmed when he felt a slender hand on his shoulder.<p>Fingers drumming on his collarbone, Setsuna closed her eyes for a moment. When she<br/>opened them again, however, they showed a strange determination.<p>She withdrew her hand and waved it in front of his face, telling him to move over. He<br/>obliged, and found Setsuna plopping herself down to the spot where he had just occupied.<br/>Instinctively, Ranma tried to move away to put a more comfortable distance between<br/>them, but Setsuna was having none of that, and grabbed him by both of his arms before<br/>he could escape.<p>"Wh – what are you doing?" He asked, quite alarmed now. To his surprise, she smiled –<br/>a first for the whole day, and it lit up the room. "Showing you what you need to do to<br/>your fiancée, Saotome-san," she replied in a rich, sensuous voice that nearly made his<br/>pigtail stand on its end.<p>"Watch carefully," she said, still holding him at arm's length. "Big sister Setsuna is only<br/>going to demonstrate this one time. I'm going to pretend that I'm you, and that you're<br/>Akane, okay?" She eyed him carefully, making sure that she had his undivided attention.<p>Ranma goggled at her instead. "Big… big sister Setsuna?"<p>"Just nod your head and say 'okay'," Setsuna commanded.<p>Ranma nodded. "Okay," he said.<p>Then, before he knew what happened, he found himself looking at her dark green tresses,<br/>his chest pressed against her bosom as her arms circled around him, hugging him for all<br/>she was worth. "Don't leave me," Setsuna whispered into his ear, clutching at him with<br/>the desperation of someone drowning, and sent a flush all the way from his earlobes<br/>down to his neck. Ranma gulped, and decided to focus his senses elsewhere… like the<br/>strange fragrance in the crook of her neck and in her hair.<p>And, just as suddenly, Setsuna released him from the embrace, pushing him back to an<br/>arm's length away. Ranma hoped that it was purely his imagination when her smile<br/>widened as she saw his flaming-red face. "You got that?" She asked.<p>"Um, yeah, I, I got it, I think."<p>"Good," she said, sounding like a school teacher praising a student for being not<br/>completely brain-dead. "Now, you practice it on me."<p>Ranma pointed a finger at himself, then drew a straight line across and pointed at her.<br/>"I'm practicing on… you?"<p>"Yeah," Setsuna nodded matter-of-factly. "You just be yourself this time, and pretend<br/>that I'm Akane. Let's go." She sat up and prepared herself.<p>To his shock, Ranma saw that she was really taking this whole thing seriously as he<br/>looked into her red eyes. Finally, he mustered up his courage, and held his breath as if he<br/>were going for a dive. "It's just pretend," he said self-assuredly. Then he moved.<p>"Don't leave me," he said, gathering her in his arms, holding her with the fervor he used<br/>on a reversal-jewel controlled Shampoo, and with the reverence he had for the cask of<br/>Nannichuan water lost to Happosai during the failed wedding. If Ranma had his eyes<br/>open at the time, he would have seen a stunned Setsuna with her eyes fluttering open for<br/>a moment before gently closing them again. He did, however, feel her going limp briefly<br/>in his arms, before she snaked her arms out of the hug, circled them to his back and laid<br/>her hands against his shoulder-blades.<p>She feels so incredibly soft, Ranma thought, then tried to drive the thought away<br/>immediately. And she's really beautiful. Like a burst dam, other parts of his mind<br/>started to add even more details to his opinion of Setsuna. And kind. When she's not<br/>pissed off, that is.<p>Ranma knew he was losing the battle when he started to remember about the time he<br/>accidentally saw more thigh than he needed way back when he first met her. Just as<br/>undesirable was the memory of their second meeting, when his eyes lingered just a<br/>moment too long on her shapely derriere, but that came back to him as well. And the<br/>smell of her too; kami, it reminded him of –<p>"Um, Meiou-san?" Unable to stop himself, Ranma asked, his head still on her shoulder.<p>"Mmm?" She murmured lazily.<p>"Um, I dunno how to say this…" Ranma said hesitantly, dislodging himself until they<br/>could see eye-to-eye… and this time he stopped completely, the words he was going to<br/>say fell soundlessly past his lips.<p>Long, mesmerizing eyelashes framed twin orbs of red. He had seen them a long time<br/>ago, he suddenly recalled, while he was still on the road with Pops. Deep in the heart of<br/>China, surrounded by a set of precipitous ridges, a lake at night: against the satin sky, a<br/>pale moon gleamed back at its double in the middle of the pool; except that there were<br/>red petals in the water, under a sheet of gossamer mist, and the petals, somehow,<br/>converged into the center and stained the fake moon a mysterious crimson, making it<br/>outdo the splendor of the original by far. He had stood near the banks for hours that night<br/>thinking that he'd never see something like that again for the rest his life.<p>He was wrong.<p>This time, in her eyes, he had to contend with two of those moons. The mist parted for<br/>him, and suddenly, it was just the red moons and he, peering at one another with naked<br/>honesty, the slight ripples in the limpid ponds inviting him to come just a tiny bit closer.<br/>He could see himself in those crimson moons, he discovered in wonder. He wanted to<br/>come closer, to see even better, to reach into those moons and –<p>Not used to such close scrutiny, Setsuna turned her gaze away reflexively and broke the<br/>spell. "S- Saotome-san," she stammered, a small blush creeping into her cheeks, "What<br/>were you going to say?"<p>Ranma blinked. "Um, heh, right…" he responded just as eloquently. Then, taking a<br/>quick sniff of the air, he remembered. "Oh, that's right, I was wondering…" he peered at<br/>her once more, but tried to stay clear of meeting those red eyes again. "Meiou-san," he<br/>started, his pigtail itching to be scratched again like a bad habit, "I know you hate<br/>cockroaches and all, but…"<p>"But…?" Setsuna echoed, not understanding where he was going at all.<p>"But," he continued, taking another whiff of her, and looking more embarrassed for her<br/>than for himself, "even so, do you have to sprinkle insecticide all over yourself?"<p>Whatever romantic mood Setsuna had been in leapt from the top of a skyscraper and<br/>plunged toward the ground and a gory death.<p>.<br/>7<br/>December 15, 1997<br/>9:14 AM<p>"…so he thought the 'Desire' you were wearing was bug-spray? Wahahahaha!"<br/>Momoko burst into laughter, holding her stomach with a hand and nearly falling off her<br/>chair. "How the hell could anyone be so dense?" Then, seeing the poker face Setsuna<br/>had carefully set up to conceal the look of annoyance in her eyes, she sat up again,<br/>managing to tone down her voice. "But, you're right though, Senpai. I guess people like<br/>Saotome-san really are disconnected from the rest of the society, just like you said, if he<br/>couldn't tell perfume from pesticide."<p>"Tell me about it," the green-haired woman muttered, looking away, her chin propped up<br/>by an arm planted on her desk. "But, he was a nice guy though, Momoko-chan," Setsuna<br/>amended grudgingly. "He got me out of my mood when I read that postcard."<p>The brown-haired girl pushed a stray lock back from her forehead and paused. Then,<br/>gauging her friend's expression carefully, she wet her lips. "Say, Senpai…"<p>"Hmm?"<p>"Have you, like, actually thought about getting together with Saotome-san?"<p>Setsuna whipped her head back so fast that it nearly hurt. "What are you talking about?"<br/>She asked, stunned.<p>"I mean, you just defended him, and he really sounds like a pretty nice guy… and kind of<br/>clueless too, and wasn't that what you liked about Yamaguchi-san anyway?"<p>Setsuna's lips parted, then she quickly swallowed what she was going to say. She tilted<br/>her head to one side, contemplating. "You must be kidding me," she said finally, looking<br/>at the younger girl with an askew glance. "I'm not falling for Mr. Raid."<p>.<br/>8<br/>December 15, 1997<br/>7:29 PM<p>"I'm home!" Ranma called out customarily as he stepped through the doorway. This<br/>time, Setsuna responded as usual. "Oh, welcome back," she said from her habitual spot<br/>on her sofa. He took off his shoes and headed towards her.<p>"Want one?" She said, wearing a familiar red silk blouse under a white jacket and a pair<br/>of tight jeans, holding up a bottle in one hand. Ranma took a look at it and shook his<br/>head.<p>"I don't drink, Meiou-san," he said. "What's the occasion anyway? This looks<br/>expensive."<p>"It is," she said, waving a hand. "But I've got more where that came from." She pointed<br/>to the ten crates by the bathroom that Ranma had almost forgotten had stuff in them, as<br/>they had been left there untouched ever since she moved in. "Those were all vintage<br/>champagne and Bordeaux bottles that my relatives brought for me to celebrate the<br/>wedding. Now that Takuya's remarried, I'll just finish all of these without him." She<br/>looked down to the ground for a second, as if examining her legs. Then she turned to him<br/>instantly, wearing a sweet smile on her face. "Saotome-san, are you sure you're not<br/>going to have some?" She asked even as she downed another glass. He declined.<p>Setsuna pouted slightly, a hint of red showing on her cheeks. "Ooh, you're no fun. But,<br/>here," she said, grabbing another bottle from behind her back, "at least open this for me,<br/>please?" Unable to refuse a simple request like that, Ranma took the bottle from her<br/>hand and uncorked it, when a jet of bubbling champagne caught him square in the face.<p>"Got you! Ahahahaha–" Setsuna laughed, falling back into the couch as she kicked her<br/>legs up and threw her head back against the cushion. Her laughter, however, was short-<br/>lived when she saw a wet Ranma-chan stare back at her in a dumbfounded manner. "I…<br/>I can explain this, Meiou-san," she said, holding her palms out in front of her in a<br/>placating gesture, "really, I can."<p>Setsuna, however, was not open to explanations. She kicked her couch back and dived to<br/>the side until her back was to the piano. "Y-youma!" She accused. Then, before<br/>Ranma-chan's eyes, the green-haired woman stood up triumphantly and shouted.<p>"Pluto Planet Power, Make-Up!" A flurry of poses ensued for nearly half a minute as<br/>Ranma-chan watched on agog. When it all ended, however, Setsuna paused in a stance<br/>that she always secretly thought was a bit grandstanding, before exploding into action.<br/>She was about to start her attack when she saw the redhead holding her stomach and<br/>rolling on the floor laughing. She halted.<p>Strange, she wasn't supposed to do that, Setsuna thought, looking down at herself to see<br/>what could possibly garner such mirth from the daemon girl. She froze instantly as she<br/>figured out what went wrong.<p>Slowly, an inch at a time, she turned her head to the side and looked up at her hand. Oh,<br/>that's why, a little part of her mind voiced out.<p>Setsuna dropped the champagne bottle in her hand that she'd been waving around like a<br/>henshin pen. "Oops," she said sheepishly at the redhead, and started to scratch the back<br/>of her head with a hand.<p>.<br/>9<br/>December 15, 1997<br/>10:49 PM<p>"…so, you turn into a girl with, um, cold water?" Setsuna asked slowly in a raised voice,<br/>her back slumped partially against his as she sat on the couch at an outward angle. "And<br/>you've fought a… dragon and, hmm, a demigod? And traveled through time with a – uh,<br/>mirror?" She could feel him lethargically tilt his head in a slow, exaggerated nod.<p>"Ain't no demigod," said Ranma, stopping for a hiccup. "'Scuse me. Anyway, he's just<br/>a stupid overgrown bird. Cologne – remember the old ghoul I told you?" He rambled<br/>on, lolling his head a little, "See, she – she said that the Amazons used to, uh, set up<br/>ambushes during winter, after they found out that a lot of them phoenix liked to migrate<br/>south with the ducks when the mountaintop got cold."<p>Setsuna barked a laugh.<p>"…and anyway, you said you, like, um, used to be one of them re-reincarnated magical<br/>girls?" Ranma countered. She nodded back. "On a s-sentai team that, eh, battled evil<br/>from, like, beyond the universe?" he asked sluggishly, trying to keep his head up so it<br/>wouldn't fall onto her shoulder. Another nod. "In mini-skirts and training bras?" The<br/>last was conveyed with a raised eyebrow that took some effort to maintain in place.<p>"The bras were only for Hotaru-chan and Small Lady," Setsuna clarified in a surprisingly<br/>lucid tone, taking the time to pronounce the words clearly. "We had to buy one for, um,<br/>Hotaru-chan, and Small Lady was using hand-me-downs from her mom."<p>The two fell silent again, and turned to face each other after a moment. They laughed as<br/>one.<p>It was probably best left unmentioned that around them there were already more than<br/>three crates worth of empty wine bottles at this point.<p>Setsuna was the first to recover from their drunken laughter. "So that's why you<br/>sometimes come home all drenched," she said, eyeing him with an enlightened look on<br/>her face, her mind skipping back several parts of the conversation. He nodded. And just<br/>as suddenly, something came to Ranma.<p>"Say, S…Setsuna-san?" He asked through another hiccup.<p>Setsuna turned even redder, even though she knew he probably wasn't aware of the<br/>familiar tone he'd taken with her. "Y…yes?" She asked, her heart thudding wildly<br/>against her chest, sending the warmth she felt from the alcohol down to her limbs in<br/>waves and making them feel like putty.<p>"I just remembered something. Just… just a second," he said as he rose and staggered<br/>away into his bedroom, knocking over several empty bottles on the ground as he did so.<br/>A few minutes later, he drifted out from the room with a worn-out looking backpack in<br/>one hand, and fell into the sofa unceremoniously. He untied the strings on the top and<br/>upended the bag, shaking all the contents out.<p>"W-What are you doing?" Setsuna asked, intrigued. Ranma didn't reply, choosing to<br/>focus on his search as his hands deftly went through the pile of belongings on the<br/>cushion, temporarily fighting off the effects of the wine. Finally, he found what he was<br/>looking for. "S…Say, Setsuna-san, you were like, the Senshi of Time, or something like<br/>that, right?" He asked again.<p>She nodded.<p>"And, like, you could, you know, control time?"<p>Another nod. Ranma took on an excited expression at that, looking at her hopefully.<br/>Blushing furiously under the close scrutiny, Setsuna turned away and stammered<br/>uncharacteristically again. "W…What?"<p>"Can you fix my watch?" Totally forgetting that just a short while earlier, Setsuna had,<br/>hemming and hawing, just informed him that she had lost all her powers, Ranma asked,<br/>depositing a cheap, digital wristwatch into her hands. She turned the thing face-up<br/>reflexively, and saw the numbers reading "21:35" – almost an hour ago, she thought as<br/>she verified the time with her own watch. Just as suddenly, she realized the absurdity of<br/>his request, and Setsuna looked at him with a poleaxed expression. Her jaw fell open,<br/>and she stared at Ranma just as she had done when she witnessed, for the first time, a<br/>Brumdah beast on the deserts of Io back in the Silver Millennium, kill itself by actually<br/>forgetting how to breathe. Then her temper ignited through the haze of alcohol and drove<br/>her into sobriety in almost an instant.<p>"You –" she started, waving a shaking hand at him, watch included, "you –" she huffed,<br/>groping for words to describe his stupidity, and failed. She settled for glaring at him, but<br/>then discovered that his expectant and trusting look was absolutely driving her up the<br/>wall. Setsuna debated whether it would be more satisfying to laugh at him, or just<br/>throttle him to death. Choking won.<p>She closed in on him, and was about to clamp her fingers around his neck and squeeze<br/>painfully when her movement sent a gleaming object falling out of the pile of clothes and<br/>onto the floor. Surprised, she put her anger on hold and picked the thing up, and her eyes<br/>widened in shock as she thought she felt tiny, invisible sparks of time magic dancing on<br/>her fingertips when they touched the object. "Say, is this…"<p>Ranma stared at it with an equally stunned expression. "…a piece of the Nanban<br/>mirror?" He nodded, mouth going dry all of a sudden. How in the world did a piece of<br/>Nanban get into his stuff, and he didn't even know about it until now?<p>"This… this is the one where you shed a tear, and you can wish on it to go back in time?"<br/>Setsuna pressed on, growing more and more exhilarated by the second.<p>Ranma confirmed absently with another nod. Then, realizing that Setsuna was clutching<br/>the large shard of Nanban in her hands and dropping a tear onto its surface, he queried<br/>weakly as a sense of dread filled him. "Um, Meiou-san, what are you doing?"<p>Setsuna thought for a second before she replied. "I'm fixing your damned watch, that's<br/>what." Then, before he could realize what she meant, Setsuna danced away from him,<br/>holding the piece of mirror high in the air as she made several pirouettes. "Mirror,<br/>mirror, on the wall," she stated grandly, "I wish you'd take me back to the time when I<br/>was still Sailor Pluto!"<p>Ranma gaped. Then, without knowing exactly why, he lunged for her. "Wait, Setsuna!"<p>Light burst forth from the fragment of the Nanban, inundating the room and nearly<br/>blinding him. "No!" He yelled, turning his head to the side and holding his hands in<br/>front of his face as it engulfed him like a tidal wave.<p>And then there was only white.<p>.<br/>(END CHAPTER)<p>Special Thanks to: Figment, as usual, for pre-read proceedings and excellent advice, as<br/>well as Thermopyle for suggestions on how to further torment Setsuna.
