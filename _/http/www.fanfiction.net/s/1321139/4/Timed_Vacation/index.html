</div>1<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>5:33 AM<p>Some would call it evil.<p>Some would call it a lot of names, as a matter of fact. The most frequently used, when<br/>directed at it, would be either "Aaah!" or "Aaaah!", or an occasional, full-fledged,<br/>"Aaaaaaaaaah!" The pitch and length of the "-a" usually conveyed the amount of fear<br/>and disgust it struck into the hearts of the humans who sighted it. Never mind that all it<br/>ever wanted was a little nourishment and a place to rest.<p>Had it been able to think in human terms and realize that its kind had been loathed and<br/>hunted down by the humans throughout history, it would have laughed. Screw you, it<br/>would have said, and your momma too. My kind has survived the ice-age while your<br/>ancestors were still hanging off tree-limbs and didn't know what to do with a banana<br/>other than to eat it. Not that it would have done any different, mind you; about the<br/>banana, that is.<p>Tonight, however, it had only thoughts for one thing - namely, a place to rest. Preferably<br/>somewhere dark, and slightly damp. It moved.<p>Distance, of course, was never an issue; nor was height. There was only forward and<br/>backward, and sometimes left and right. All objects were either flat or mostly-flat, and<br/>the only differences lay in the wetness, softness, and the amount of heat they produced.<p>It had just traversed a vast terrain of cold-dry-flat-hard, through another part of cold-dry-<br/>flat-hard, and was now on something completely different: cool-dry-mostly-flat-soft.<br/>And there was a fragrance in the air nearby, an enticing scent that it had never<br/>encountered before. It decided to investigate.<p>The surface underneath its feet shifted, then shifted some more. It didn't matter in the<br/>slightest. It pressed onward, onward, onward, and finally hit the jackpot: lukewarm-<br/>slightly-damp-mostly-flat-pretty-soft. Not its usual type of resting place, but it wasn't all<br/>that picky about having a change in habitat. It tucked its feet inward and nestled its head<br/>against this lukewarm-slightly-damp-mostly-flat-pretty-soft.<p>Had it been able to appreciate the glorious view laid out before its eyes, it would have<br/>thought: Lo, and it was pink.<p>What it thought was: Sleep.<p>What a waste.<p>.<br/>2<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>5:34 AM<p>Having unsightly sleeping postures was a peculiarity of sorts that Meiou Setsuna<br/>inherited along with her particular senshi title. Something about the gravitational field<br/>and the rotational difference of the planet, no doubt, caused all the Sailor Plutos to twist<br/>and turn their bodies excessively but in a periodical and orderly fashion while they were<br/>sleeping on Earth.<p>A quick study would show that at least twenty-five days out of an average month on<br/>Earth, the position of Setsuna's body in relation to the head of the bed followed a pattern<br/>(based on an eight-hour-average sleeping time) detailed as below. Observe:<p>Two hours into sleep: Setsuna's upper body would bend roughly ninety-degrees to her<br/>right, feet pointing to the foot of the bed.<p>Four hours into sleep: Setsuna's body would present a generally linear posture, but her<br/>head would now be pointing to the foot of the bed, and vice-versa.<p>Six hours into sleep: Setsuna's upper body would bend roughly ninety-degrees to her<br/>right, feet pointing to the head of the bed.<p>Eight hours into sleep: Setsuna would find herself awake in nearly the same position in<br/>which she went to sleep without realizing that she had, once again, drawn a full circle<br/>around the bed with her body.<p>Almost like the hands of a clock, but running in reverse direction. The precision,<br/>however, like everything else Sailor Pluto did, was uncannily and inexorably perfect.<p>In the hour before dawn, Setsuna slept soundly on her bed, her lithe figure a contour<br/>made visible in the dark by the silk burgundy nightgown she wore.<p>As she went to bed at approximately 11:30 PM last night, she had just gone past the<br/>designated sixth-hour spot and was currently on her way to realign her body back to the<br/>zero-hour position. The sheets dragged and slipped haphazardly against the silk as she<br/>moaned and softly lifted a leg, her milk-colored thighs all the more prominent on the<br/>canvas of red.<p>She stretched softly, arching her back into the air for a tiniest instant as a small tremor<br/>danced across her pale skin, before she fell back into the yielding warmth of the mattress.<p>An arm languidly made its way across her stomach, up over her head, and in the end<br/>found itself buried under the mass of disheveled emerald tresses. A chancy deep breath<br/>made the kinks across the plunging v-line on her nightgown wink out for a brief moment.<br/>Then, before she let out the breath she was holding, she felt it.<p>Small, feathery taps along the inside of her left leg.<p>Still in the ethereal state between dreaming and waking, Setsuna shrugged it off, let out<br/>the breath, and continued to sleep. Besides, the feeling was actually somewhat pleasant,<br/>the waking part of her mind decided; not unlike the smooth fingers of a gentle lover<br/>leisurely caressing her skin. She snored softly.<p>The taps continued. And began to climb up her leg.<p>She obliged.<p>The taps went higher, past the curve of her knee and up against her thigh. It was starting<br/>to tickle.<p>The soft snoring stopped.<p>Somewhat alert now, Setsuna's mind tried to collect itself from slumber and produce a<br/>coherent thought. The velvety touches continued, not unlike the smooth fingers –<p>Saotome-san?<p>of a gentle lover –<p>Wait a minute…<p>leisurely –<p>That, that's too high…<p>caressing her skin –<p>Stop it; hold on a second…<p>and resting against –<p>You've got a fiancée!<p>the secret –<p>…And we've only known each other for two weeks! Stop! Saotome-san!<p>Setsuna shot up, scrunching her legs against her chest in reflex as she curled herself into a<br/>ball, hands covering the area between her legs protectively. A scarlet blush matching her<br/>gown bloomed across her cheeks as she looked wildly about, drawing in rugged deep<br/>breaths all the while. Strange, though, there was no Saotome-san. It was only her, sitting<br/>in the middle of the mattress in the dark, her hair a mess like the crumpled bed-sheets<br/>underneath her. She sighed in relief. Then her mind immediately fired the unanswered<br/>question:<p>Well, if it wasn't Saotome-san, then what the hell was that crawling up my…<p>Uncomprehending, curious, and slightly apprehensive, she lifted her nightgown up past<br/>her hips.<p>x x x<p>Red eyes stared at a pair of antennae.<p>Antennae waved: This is my turf, lady.<p>Red eyes flew wide open.<p>.<br/>3<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>5:37 AM<p>The other residents in the apartment building got an early wake-up call that day.<p>Those who were already up and about, however, plugged their ears with their fingers<br/>quickly, took note of the vibrating windows, and told the couple on the third floor to just<br/>skip the hotel and go straight to a bomb shelter.<p>x x x<p>"-the hell?" Ranma leapt out of his room and flipped the light switch outside the door,<br/>instantly alert from years of vigorous training in the past and scanning the apartment for<br/>danger signs. He got a full-contact glomp by a shaking mass of feminine flesh barely<br/>concealed under a flimsy red nightgown.<p>"C – Co – Cockroach!" Setsuna sobbed, pointing a shaky finger at her room. Sure<br/>enough, the culprit slowly emerged from under her door and leisurely strolled into the<br/>living room.<p>"You woke everybody in the building up over a damned cockroach?"<p>"You've got to kill it!"<p>What is it with girls and cockroaches? He thought in vexation. And didn't she just get<br/>over her run-in with those killer doves? Suddenly, an evil grin made its way onto his<br/>face. This was the perfect chance for him to get back at all the trouble she'd caused him.<p>"Why should I? It was in your room," he said, trying to sound completely indifferent.<br/>"You go kill it."<p>Setsuna gaped at him in horror. Ranma smiled back beatifically.<p>Abandoning the glomp in the interest of self-preservation, Setsuna dashed across the<br/>living room floor heroically, jumped over the glass table and dived into the couch on the<br/>far side. The purse that she left there overnight was snatched up and upended in an<br/>instant, and the contents inside spilled onto the sofa. No matter, however; her hand had<br/>found her ace.<p>Forcing her heart back down her throat, Setsuna took a deep breath and blew as loudly as<br/>she could into the safety whistle.<p>x x x<p>This time, lights in the adjacent buildings down the block came on as one.<p>The cockroach advanced.<p>.<br/>4<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>5:39 AM<p>"DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A BIT MUCH?" Ranma yelled as he followed<br/>Setsuna's fleeing figure out to the staircase, hands cupped over his ears.<p>"You forced my hand," she managed in between gasps. Then, realizing that he couldn't<br/>hear her, she repeated more loudly again. "I SAID, 'YOU FORCED MY HAND!'"<p>"OH!" He considered her reply and nodded. Then, seeing that the cockroach had just<br/>wandered out of the apartment as well, he gave it a gentle nudge in the right direction<br/>with a bare foot. Setsuna's eyes widened and desperately darted about, looking for<br/>anything that she could use to fend off the bane of her existence.<p>"So," Having some time to clear the ringing in his head, he said more calmly this time,<br/>"What are you gonna do about it?"<p>She pulled the fire alarm.<p>.<p>.<br/>TIMED VACATION<p>.<br/>Chapter Three<p>Opening Theme: Close to You (Instrumental)<br/>Composed by: CAGNET<p>.<br/>5<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>8:48 AM<p>"Ah. Tchaikovsky." A voice announced from the other side of the room as his hands<br/>lowered to his sides. "Piano Concerto, number one, B-flat minor. Flawless as usual,<br/>Saotome-san."<p>Ranma looked up from the bench. "Oh, sensei." He paused to scratch the pigtail. "Sorry<br/>about that. Didn't think anyone was going to be using the spare practice room."<p>The other man waved it off. "No, it's perfectly fine. That's what this place is for<br/>anyway." He said, a few etched lines forming by the corner of his mouth as he smiled<br/>benignly. "You've come a long way in such a short time, Saotome-san. I've never seen<br/>anyone with hands as deft as yours, not to mention the way you memorize the pieces."<p>"Ahh. It's nothing," Ranma replied, trying to sound embarrassed despite his mounting<br/>ego. "By the way, sensei, about the contest last month…"<p>"Oh, that..." The older man trailed off, pushing a pair of glasses higher up the bridge of<br/>his nose. He shrugged uncomfortably.<p>The hopeful expression on Ranma's face fell. "I see…"<p>"The judges thought that while your skill was very remarkable, they just couldn't sense<br/>enough feelings in your performance."<p>Disappointment gave way to puzzlement. "Feeling?"<p>"Yes. While the other finalist was not quite able to match you in technique alone, the<br/>panel ruled in favor of her because she played with a tremendous amount of emotion."<br/>Pulling up a chair from nearby, the professor slowly sat down next to his student. "Tell<br/>me, Saotome-san. What do you feel when you're playing the piano?"<p>Ranma regarded his teacher. The middle-aged man looked relaxed in the folding chair,<br/>hands resting on knees, waiting patiently. He scratched his chin with a finger reflexively<br/>as he tried to muster an answer. "Um, actually," Ranma replied hesitantly, "I don't think<br/>I feel anything when I play. It's always like… like I'm fighting against the piano. So, I<br/>guess if you want to, you can say that I feel like I'm in some kind of battle whenever I<br/>play."<p>The other man closed his eyes and nodded. "Mmm, I see."<p>"Is that… wrong?"<p>Lips pursing, the professor was silent for nearly a full minute before he answered. "It's<br/>not wrong, per se," said the man, "but the piano – or any other instrument, as a matter of<br/>fact – becomes a conduit between the performer and the audience at very high levels.<br/>Sometimes, if you listen closely enough, it's almost as if you can understand what exactly<br/>the person behind the instrument is thinking through the music."<p>Ranma thought about that. "I'm not getting it," he admitted at last with a small frown.<br/>"How can you tell what someone is feeling or thinking just by listening to a song?"<p>The professor smiled back. "Someday you will, Saotome-san. Someday you will."<p>.<br/>6<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>9:34 AM<p>My back's killing me, thought Setsuna. She was sitting so stiffly in her chair that, taking<br/>into account of her grass-green blouse, the matching light-green jacket, and the pair of<br/>plaid pants with green undertones that she chose to wear today, you'd have thought that<br/>she was trying to imitate a chameleon in the wild, attempting to learn how to camouflage.<p>If she was trying to hide, however, she was not succeeding. The newspaper Setsuna held<br/>out in front of her was only nearly enough to hide her face completely from the girl<br/>sitting next to her. She moved it higher.<p>"So you're the reason why the westbound traffic into town was paralyzed for half an hour<br/>this morning? Ahahahaha!" That was Momoko, the one person from work who stood<br/>out in her memories when she suddenly found herself working as a model a little over a<br/>year ago. They had grown quite close over the past year, which was why Setsuna<br/>endured without a word when the younger woman insisted on calling her "Senpai". Like<br/>now.<p>"Senpai," Momoko continued, convulsing every few seconds from the effort of trying not<br/>to erupt into full-blown laughter, "you're… you're simply the best. I mean, who<br/>would've thought of trying to scare away a cockroach with an emergency whistle?"<p>Setsuna glared at her friend. "Cockroaches and I will not coexist under the same roof,"<br/>she declared between clenched teeth. "Besides," she added defensively after a moment,<br/>"the whistle did work on those damned birds."<p>"But… pulling a fire alarm?" Unable to contain herself any further, the young girl<br/>guffawed, slapping a hand on her desk several times as she did so.<p>"I don't see why you think it's funny," said the green-haired woman stonily behind the<br/>thin wall of newspaper she recently erected between the two of them. "Do you know<br/>how big a fine I have to pay for this? And how I had to bow and apologize to just about<br/>everybody who lives within three blocks, plus all the firefighters and the police who<br/>came?" She finished testily, temporarily taking a hand away from the newspaper to<br/>massage her sore back. She winced.<p>Seeing this, a fresh gale of laughter broke out from the seat next to her. Momoko, as<br/>Setsuna realized when the two first met, had a peach-shaped face true to her namesake,<br/>framed by a head of curly brown hair that went down to the shoulders. Her beige-colored<br/>blouse, red leather skirt and knee-high boots ensemble today could be called conservative<br/>at best for people who knew her well.<p>Right now, however, Setsuna only took stock of her friend's visage. Flushing with<br/>uncontrollable amusement, the young girl's face looked even more like a ripe, succulent<br/>peach than usual. Setsuna briefly flirted with the idea of shooting an arrow through it,<br/>like the way that English guy William Tell did to the apples. She amused herself with<br/>picturing how much juice would leak out from the entry and exit points of the arrow all<br/>the way until Momoko's laughter had run dry at last.<p>It took quite a while.<p>x x x<p>"So, Senpai," Momoko said at last after her mirth had wound down to only an occasional<br/>giggle, "you actually moved in with that Sao… something guy? You know, the one that<br/>plays the piano?"<p>Setsuna put the paper down on her desk and looked squarely at her friend for a moment.<br/>She sighed quietly. "Yeah. His name's Saotome."<p>"Ohhh. Sa-o-to-me-san…" The younger girl punctuated each syllable with a nod, eyes<br/>peering to the sides in thought. Suddenly, she inched closer to Setsuna. "How's he in<br/>bed?"<p>Caught completely off-guard by the question, it took the older woman quite a while to<br/>produce an intelligible reply. "…Hah?"<p>"Don't tell me you guys haven't even…"<p>"Of course not!" Setsuna denied hotly. "Saotome-san and I have barely talked. Most of<br/>the time, he's kept to himself pretty much, and the only things he'd say were "I'm<br/>home!" or "Good-night!" We've chatted maybe once or twice during the whole time."<p>"But, how come you never tried to find out more about the guy? Didn't you say he's cute<br/>and young and single? He's like–" Momoko groped for the description, then found it. "–<br/>like the perfect rebound candidate!"<p>"Who said I'm looking to rebound?" Setsuna asked archly. "Besides, he's not my type.<br/>And it's not like I haven't tried to talk to him…" –it was just next to impossible to pry<br/>any information out of that guy, her thought finished. Two weeks, and all she knew<br/>about him was that he has a fiancée, that he used to live in Nerima, and that he's on the<br/>black list of every all-you-can-eat restaurant this side of Tokyo, a fact that she found out<br/>too late when she tried to treat him to one last week, only to get thrown out the door<br/>immediately. They ended up at a Ramen shop that night instead.<p>In any event, it was just much easier – and safer – to leave her curiosity alone. She did<br/>not want a repeat of that argument on the day she moved in. "Anyway," Setsuna said,<br/>"this is not what you think it is, Momoko-chan."<p>"But," Momoko protested, fingers intertwined as she clasped her hands in front of her,<br/>"but it's so romantic! How can you pass this up? I mean, you're, like, practically living<br/>with Elton John!"<p>"I don't like Elton John," Setsuna deadpanned. She took a few seconds to compose<br/>herself, then finally turned back to the younger girl. "Momoko-chan," she said in a<br/>lecturing tone, "it's not always that easy. People like Saotome-san… you see them in<br/>concerts, you see them on TV; you see pictures of their faces on albums in music stores.<br/>But there's a lot of difference between what you see and reality. It's not like I'm eating<br/>fine French cuisine by candlelight every night, and he's there to play the piano to help me<br/>digest the food. You may not want to think about it, but pianists have to eat too, and they<br/>have to sleep. They use toilets like we do, and sometimes forget to flush." Good thing<br/>Saotome-san's not like that, Setsuna thought as she paused momentarily and gave silent<br/>thanks to whatever kami that might be listening.<p>She continued. "And it's often harder to live with those people, because a lot of times all<br/>they think about is their art and their music, and everything else they just push to the<br/>side." Not quite so in Haruka and Michiru's case, a distant thought reminded her; but<br/>that was part of the reason why she had enjoyed living with them. "It's really not the<br/>romantic fairy-tale thing that you made it out to be. So," Setsuna wrapped up the topic<br/>neatly without emotion, looking at her young friend with half-lidded eyes, "can we end<br/>this discussion now?"<p>Momoko took on the expression of a junior-high schoolgirl who was just informed that<br/>her favorite shoujo series was slashed from the air to make room for Pokemon. "I<br/>guess…" she said, utterly disappointed.<p>"Good," the green-haired woman stood up and dragged her friend out of her chair by the<br/>hand. "Let's go, Momoko-chan; I want to check the bulletin board and see what kind of<br/>work we've got for today."<p>x x x<p>Two plastic-looking cups attached through a hose to some sort of an engine trembled and<br/>danced across the table in front of Setsuna. She was busy reading the attached flyer.<br/>"Introducing the 'T-Rex'? A Mammoth Innovation of Epic Proportions and Historical<br/>Importance?" She raised an eyebrow, and turned to the machine.<p>"No." Setsuna took exactly one look at the pulsating device squirming around on her<br/>boss's table and flatly refused. "I'm not taking this one."<p>"But, but, Setsuna-chan!" pleaded her boss, a balding middle-aged man with pudgy,<br/>stump-like limbs, and a belly that threatened to burst through the extra-large oxford shirt<br/>he wore whenever he inhaled. "You can be on television! Aren't you always saying that<br/>you need a big break?"<p>"By doing a breast pump commercial?" Setsuna knew better than to flare her temper at<br/>her boss, but she nearly did so this time anyway.<p>"It's only going to be aired during the AV blocks late at night!"<p>"That's even worse! I'm not going to be known across Japan as the Midnight Milkmaid<br/>whose commercials only come on between bad blow-job scenes … and turn that thing<br/>off, Momoko-chan!" She barked. "It's really distracting."<p>Momoko picked up the buzzing, semi-transparent device and examined it thoroughly like<br/>a kid at the science fair. She looked through the thing, squeezed the gel cups, held it to<br/>her ears and tried to see if it makes wave sounds like seashells. Finally, she placed the<br/>still-vibrating cups onto her chest. "Hmm… do men really find big breasts attractive? I<br/>wonder what Kyo-chan would think…" she turned the dial up. "Ooh, this feels nice…"<p>At last finding a supporter in the cause, Setsuna's boss hurried over to her friend's side.<br/>"See? I tell you, this is a nifty gadget. There's a suction mode, a massage mode, and an<br/>undulation mode, plus you can set it on timers too! Momoko-chan, the guys at the<br/>company say that they'll even send you ten sets of these T-Rex breast sculpture modules<br/>for free if you'd just do this thirty-second-segment…"<p>Setsuna held one hand to her forehead, closed her eyes, and tried to ignore the two "T-<br/>Rex" enthusiasts behind her.<p>"Oh, Senpai!" Momoko called out in wonder. "Look… if you turn the dial up, and put<br/>the engine in reverse mode, you can even make this into an oxygen mask!" The curly<br/>brunette demonstrated cheerfully. On the fourth breath, Setsuna turned around in disgust<br/>and stomped back to her desk. It was all she could do to maintain her calm exterior at<br/>this point and keep her boiling anger contained. Thinking back to the one culprit and its<br/>accomplice who toyed with her and helped to foul her day completely, she smiled thinly.<br/>By the time she got back home, she figured that the simmering rage within her should<br/>have been cooked to a delectable perfection.<p>This time, Setsuna thought, it's really an all-you-can-eat. And she'd make him choke<br/>down every piece.<p>.<br/>7<br/>November 14, 1997<br/>5:46 PM<p>She stormed up the stairs, her high heels clicking furiously on the steps. A nylon string<br/>dangled out of her left pant pocket; fortunately, she hadn't needed the whistle to deal with<br/>the killer birds today either. However, just the mere thought of the matter irritated her<br/>even further, and by the time she reached the third floor and recalled once again the<br/>atrocities that Saotome had committed against her at that very spot earlier in the morning,<br/>she was practically shaking with rage. So, he thinks that being scared of cockroaches is<br/>funny, does he?<p>Well, she had a full day of stress that she could unload now. Damned cockroach,<br/>damned birds, damned pervert boss and pervert friend… and damned that Saotome!<br/>Setsuna paused in front of the door, jamming her fingers into her purse to search for her<br/>keys.<p>I'll show him funny, she thought darkly.<p>x x x<p>Sitting on the bench, Ranma stared at the ivory and ebony keys laid out before his eyes.<br/>They stared back at him, cold and unyielding as usual, waiting to be conquered by his<br/>hands. Emotions, huh?<p>He fired a key like a warning shot. The hammer fell. The note rang true, and was flung<br/>skyward like a catapult straight through the open window. Feelings, huh?<p>With a look of determination in his eyes, he gleefully joined the battle.<p>x x x<p>Leaning against the wall next to the door, her keys in one hand, Setsuna had only one<br/>thought as she listened to the music coming from within:<p>This is so unfair.<p>Here she was, ready to come back home and give him an uncompromised and unabridged<br/>edition of her thoughts on the events that transpired earlier today, and he had to go and<br/>play that damned piano. Worse, he had to go and play that damned song.<p>It sounds kind of different this time, she noted; harsher at times, and more soothing at<br/>others. On the whole, the song seemed dichotomously laden and spontaneous, and<br/>neither of these were feelings that it evoked in her the first time she heard it. I wonder<br/>what happened to him today, Setsuna thought, before she shook her head to clear the<br/>thought away. Too late; she was dismayed to find that somewhere during the song, her<br/>blazing anger had betrayed her once more and died down into merely a slow burn.<p>This sucks, Setsuna decided, absently tapping the keys in her hand against the wall as she<br/>tried to lean further into it.<p>The song halted midway through. The door opened.<p>"Meiou-san?" Ranma regarded her in surprise. "I just heard the sound of the keys…<br/>Why didn't you come in? How long have you been standing there?"<p>"Didn't want to interrupt." Setsuna pushed herself off the wall and drifted inside. "It's a<br/>beautiful song," she said with a non-committal shrug.<p>"Thanks." A hand came up to his head, hesitated, then scratched the pigtail anyway.<br/>Then, perceiving the sour note in her voice, Ranma made the connection that she was still<br/>likely angry at him with his earlier stunt. He could have taunted like he used to, and twist<br/>that knife deeper into her wound. Or, he could have ignored it, like he used to, and let<br/>her simmer. "I'm, uh… I'm sorry about earlier," he said instead. "You had a really bad<br/>day, huh?"<p>Setsuna slowly turned to look at him. "You have no idea," she finally said, before<br/>marching across the room to plop herself down onto her couch.<p>x x x<p>"Say, Saotome-san?" Setsuna said, lifting her head from the sofa, but not looking at him<br/>either. She had her knees drawn high up onto the cushion, arms encircling her legs.<p>"Yes?" From his bench, Ranma fought a short struggle before he finally declined to<br/>further investigate whether the kinks at the underside of her plaid pants were in fact panty<br/>lines. He went back to investigating the keys of his piano instead.<p>Unaware of the brief attention she just received, Setsuna continued, a little wistfully,<br/>"Say, have you ever felt on some days that your life is turning into a total waste?"<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"I don't mean it literally." A hand came up from her side, hung in the air for a few<br/>seconds, then waved anyway. "It's just that today, I just realized I've gotten no further<br/>than where I was one year ago. I'm still only getting cheesy jobs at work, doing small<br/>ads and what not, and my boss thinks that doing a commercial for the AV blocks is going<br/>to be a big break for me. I mean, how low can you get?" Setsuna kicked her legs into the<br/>air and turned onto her back, pressing her whole weight into the cushions. She examined<br/>her nails. "On top of that, Yamaguchi's gone too, and I just feel a little… tired, you<br/>know? Like I've gone around a circle and found myself back at the beginning."<p>There was a long moment of silence in the room. "Meiou-san," at length, Ranma looked<br/>up from the piano and called out.<p>"Hmm?" She stretched.<p>"Look at it this way," he deliberated as he spoke, "Think of it… think of it as a vacation.<br/>A really, really long vacation."<p>Setsuna sat up and mussed her hair a little with one hand. "A… vacation?"<p>Ranma flipped the lid over the keyboard. "You don't always have to give it your all, or<br/>try your best at every moment, you know? Everybody has days when they're down and<br/>tired." He stood up slowly, walked across the small living room, and set himself down<br/>squarely on the other couch. "It's probably a weird way to think of it," he continued,<br/>fixing his eyes on her. "But, at times like this, I take it as a sign from some passing kami<br/>telling me to take a break. That way, I don't have to try as hard or push myself to the<br/>limit every single moment, you know? I can just… relax for a while."<p>"And then?"<p>"And then things will get better." He said confidently.<p>"…really?" She asked, feeling slightly better now.<p>"Probably," he laughed a little and amended.<p>"…Probably?" She rounded on him, slight incredulity in her voice. Probably? That was<br/>his conclusion of a pep-talk? She snorted, but a trace of a smile made its way onto her<br/>face anyway. "Say, Saotome-san?"<p>"Hmm?"<p>She made as if to say something, but fell silent again. "Oh, don't worry about it," she<br/>said at last. Ranma raised an eyebrow at that, but decided not to make an issue of it.<br/>"It's nothing."<p>"Vacation, huh…" Setsuna murmured to herself, falling back into the couch.<p>.<br/>8<br/>November 17, 1997<br/>8:35 AM<p>Monday came, and Setsuna stepped into the office with unusually high spirits. Not that<br/>normal people could tell from a glance, but the little spring in her step was immediately<br/>noticeable to all those who had been working with her long enough. She was on her way<br/>to her desk, but changed course to make a stop at her boss's office. Perhaps things would<br/>be better today, like Saotome-san had suggested. Either way, though, she was<br/>determined to stop worrying and simply go with the flow.<p>The balding man took note of the smile on her face, and picked up on her mood with a<br/>surprising acumen that she did not expect. "Setsuna-chan! You're looking marvelously<br/>happy today."<p>Instead of nodding as usual, she answered him by making a half twirl, showcasing the<br/>red, floor-length dress with zip-off sleeves that she had chosen to wear today under her<br/>favorite white jacket, before striking an alluring pose that looked all the more memorable<br/>by the effortless and almost casual way she presented it. The eye-candy was a rare and<br/>delicious treat, and her boss gobbled it up eagerly. "So, what's for work?"<p>The eagerness in the man's face slowly vanished. "Um, boss?"<p>"Well, that is," he cleared his throat for a few seconds too long, then finally said in a<br/>patronizing manner that Setsuna definitely did not like, "Setsuna-chan…" he trailed off<br/>again.<p>"Yes?"<p>The man was looking more and more uncomfortable as he continued. "See, there haven't<br/>been too many advertisement opportunities lately, and what was left had already been<br/>assigned to our younger models because the higher-ups wanted to shift the focus of our<br/>firm to a more exuberant and energetic presentation in order to attract the teenagers<br/>today…"<p>Completely disliking what she was hearing now, Setsuna stared at her boss and asked in<br/>an even tone, "What exactly are you saying?"<p>"I'm saying that your schedule's going to be looking kind of empty for a short while," he<br/>admitted. Before she could raise her objection, however, he added, "But not to worry,<br/>Setsuna-chan; you've just demonstrated how much, um, experience you have under your<br/>belt as a model, so I'm going to pull some strings and place one of our upcoming new<br/>stars under your direct guidance."<p>It took all of two seconds for her to digest the information. "You want me to be a<br/>manager?" Is he serious? "I'm supposed to be a model – no, scratch that, I'm supposed<br/>to be a fashion designer, damnit! If you can't find work for me, the least you can do is to<br/>talk with the guys at the production department and get me a place–"<p>"Wait, wait, Setsuna-chan! Don't be so angry." The man said in a placating manner.<br/>"You found out what those guys really want the first time you went there. Besides, the<br/>girl we're trying to promote is a very sweet gal; I'm sure you'll like her a lot. She just<br/>came from England not too long ago, as a matter of fact, but she speaks Japanese well<br/>enough that language barrier is not going to cause a problem. Here, let me call her in –<br/>Minako-chan!"<p>"Absolutely not," Setsuna said emphatically, finally fed up with the ridiculousness of the<br/>situation. To think, she was actually looking for good things to happen for a change…<br/>what a joke. "Listen, if you're not going to find something to fill my schedule, then I'm<br/>going to submit my resignation letter as of this–" she paused. She was positive she didn't<br/>just hear that right. Minako-chan?<p>"Coming!" A syrupy voice announced, and a teenage girl sauntered into the small office,<br/>humming a random pop tune to herself all the while.<p>Setsuna paled. Oh, hell, no.<p>Slightly over five foot with a generally lithe and athletic figure. Check. Long blond hair,<br/>with a trademark red bow in the center. Check. Disgustingly large and sparkling blue<br/>eyes that are just a shade paler to Usagi's, check. A smile that was just as disturbingly<br/>vapid as Usagi's, check. Singing a pop song that was missing notes by a mile, check…<br/>and mate.<p>"Hello! My name is Aino Minako!" She bowed politely and said in an all-too-familiar<br/>saccharine voice. "Nice to meet you. My birthday is October twenty-second, my blood-<br/>type is B, and I like idols, gyoza, and physical education! My dream is to, erm, become<br/>an idol myself!" Then, to the side, she added to the man in a whisper, "is that good<br/>enough?" Behind Setsuna's back, the man nodded furiously in confirmation.<p>More than good enough, Minako-chan, Setsuna came to the same conclusion<br/>independently at nearly the same time. She held a hand to her face and sighed. You get a<br/>cookie for the effort.<p>Then, to herself, she thought in complete dismay: This is not happening.<p>.<br/>(END CHAPTER)<p>.<br/>Once again, much thanks to Figment for the pre-reading on the chapter.<p>- ukie<p>p.s. Before you ask, Setsuna's reaction to the cockroach, while extreme, was not wholly<br/>unjustified. Her Bios read something along the line of "complete dislike / fears:<br/>cockroaches". I just tweaked it up a bit. :)
