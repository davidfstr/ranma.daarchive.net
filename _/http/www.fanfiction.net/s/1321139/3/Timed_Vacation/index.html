</div>October 5, 1997<br/>10:20 AM<p>"You want me to WHAT?"<p>Surprised at seeing only empty space in front of her, Setsuna turned her head towards the<br/>voice that came from the living room, her hands still against the wall. She was sure she<br/>hadn't blinked, so how did he get away so fast? She ran out after him.<p>"You have got to be kidding me! Do you have any idea what's waiting back home for<br/>me –" three fiancées, two Kunos, a pig, a duck, and a panda, plus a whole slew of deities<br/>whom he was sure he had offended in his past life to land him in all the mess he'd just<br/>left behind, his thought completed the sentence that he did not finish. "You, you –"<br/>Ranma sputtered as he struggled for words, then took a few deep breaths to cool down<br/>when he found none. "No," he declared, "Absolutely no freaking way."<p>Finding her target backed up against the wall on the other end, she moved in to catch him.<br/>Ranma fled into the space between the piano and the wall.<p>"You don't understand," Setsuna said as she trailed after him, hands clutched to the front<br/>of her skirt and raising it slightly. "My parents and relatives are all at the ceremony<br/>already, and you don't know how much I'd get laughed at if they found out I got jilted on<br/>my wedding day! Plus," she went on, "if you'd just wear a pair of glasses and go without<br/>shaving for a week or two, you'd look close enough to my fiancée anyway." She placed<br/>herself squarely on the other side of the grand piano, waiting to see which way he'd go.<br/>"Oh, and lose the pigtail too," she added as an afterthought, "but we still have time to<br/>take care of that right now."<p>Ranma stared at her incredulously. "You're not touching my hair," he said protectively,<br/>then made his move.<p>He feinted to the left. She dashed to her right.<p>He doubled back to the right. She followed to her left.<p>An impasse.<p>Seeing that this was going nowhere fast, Ranma tried another tactic. "Look," he said as<br/>soothingly as he could under the situation, "you're not thinking this through carefully. I<br/>mean, you're probably a really nice girl and all, and pretty cute–" No, not going there<br/>again; he'd said the same thing to Ukyou and look where it got him in the end. Pausing<br/>for a moment to collect his thoughts, he finally said, "No. This is not going to work.<br/>Besides, Takuya might have changed his mind. In fact, he's probably waiting at the<br/>square for you right now."<p>"But, the letter –"<p>"–was a mistake," Ranma interjected, "Like I said, Takuya's probably turned around. I<br/>lived with him for a year, and I never saw him bring any girls home." That includes you,<br/>he almost added, but thankfully held back at the last second. Instead, he simply said, "He<br/>just didn't look the type that would play around."<p>Truthfully, Takuya didn't look the type of just about anything, Ranma couldn't help but<br/>remember; the guy kept to himself so much that sometimes Ranma wondered whether he<br/>lived in the other room at all.<p>"But, what if –" she tried to protest again, her tone weaker this time.<p>Sensing that he'd somehow gotten the upper hand, he didn't give her the chance to finish<br/>her objection. "It's not about the 'what-ifs', Meiou-san. You have to make sure."<p>Setsuna went still. "You really think he's there?" She asked after a moment.<p>"I'm positive." He was anything but.<p>"…okay," she agreed at last.<p>The room fell silent again, leaving the two to their thoughts. And a chance to really<br/>notice each other's presence again.<p>Setsuna looked at Ranma. Ranma looked at Setsuna's leg.<p>Setsuna slowly brought her right leg down from the top of the piano, where she had<br/>attempted to climb over earlier. "I, uh, I guess I made a fool of myself back there."<br/>Ranma found it amazing that she could say something like that without actually sounding<br/>one bit embarrassed. He nodded.<p>"You don't have to agree, you know?" She snapped.<p>He nodded again.<p>"Anyway," she started in a slightly miffed tone, then softened. "I'm sorry about the<br/>piano."<p>"Oh… don't worry 'bout it. It's not like it got broken or anything," Ranma said<br/>dismissively. Would've been a completely different story if I didn't stop you back there<br/>though, he noted to himself.<p>Setsuna afforded another look at the thing. It looked almost ridiculously massive<br/>compared to the rest of the living room. "This… is not just a hobby, is it?" She swept<br/>her arm in an arc in the air, vaguely pointing at the large instrument.<p>"Yeah, I'm a music major at Gedai." Seeing that she looked slightly surprised for some<br/>reason, he clarified. "Actually, I've got a competition to go to this afternoon too." Ironic,<br/>he thought; the way the sun cast a lone beam through the window and onto the bench just<br/>now made it look almost like a spotlight in a concert hall.<p>"I see…" she nodded absently. "I was never good with music back at school," she<br/>admitted. Then, curiosity piqued, she asked, "Hmm, a piano competition? You must be<br/>pretty good then. Can you play something?"<p>"What, now?" He turned to her, startled. Seeing another nod, he let out a small chuckle<br/>that sounded more like a sigh, before turning his eyes off to the sides and clucking his<br/>tongue softly. "Um, no," he declined, "I don't think that's such a good idea. I mean, I've<br/>never really played for any person in particular before." A bit disappointed, she<br/>nevertheless nodded again in understanding. "Besides," he reminded her, "don't you<br/>have a wedding in like ten minutes?"<p>Setsuna's eyes widened at that. She hiked up her skirt and rushed for the door.<p>"Wait!" Ranma stopped her. She looked back questioningly. "You left your, uh, head,"<br/>he explained, one hand waving the wig and headdress he'd picked up from the couch.<br/>"Here."<p>"Oh." She took the thing back, struggling briefly as she tried to bundle her hair together<br/>with one hand and set the headpiece back on her head with the other. "This looks okay?"<p>"Sure," Ranma shrugged.<p>"Thanks." She headed out once more.<p>"Wait!" He called out after her again. "Um, do you have any money – for the taxi?"<br/>Seeing her blank stare, Ranma fished for his wallet in his pocket and drew out two<br/>thousand-yen notes. "Here," he said.<p>Setsuna regarded him with an expression that he couldn't quite make out. "I'll pay you<br/>back." She took the bills from his hand and stuffed them into the folds of the robe down<br/>her front.<p>Pausing slightly as she reached outside, Setsuna turned back to face him one last time.<br/>"Saotome-san?"<p>"Good luck at the contest," she said. Then she left.<p>x x x<p>After he'd made sure the woman was finally gone, Ranma closed the front door and<br/>slowly sagged against it. How the hell he'd gotten out of that one, he had no idea. He<br/>did feel a small pang of guilt, though, lying the way he did at the end just to get her to<br/>leave. Well, he thought to himself, it doesn't matter anyway; it's not like I'm going to<br/>see her again anytime soon.<p>He straightened himself up, finding some amusement at what had just happened. It had<br/>almost made him feel like he was back at the Tendo's again. A stray thought came to<br/>him suddenly. Hmm, I wonder what Akane's doing right now? He stopped himself,<br/>however, before it could go any further. Best not think about things like that, he decided,<br/>then locked the door behind him.<p>Sighing, he walked back to the piano bench and sat down. He still had a contest to win.<p>.<p>.<br/>TIMED VACATION<p>.<br/>Chapter Two<p>Opening Theme: Close to You (Instrumental)<br/>Composed by: CAGNET<p>.<br/>1<br/>October 29, 1997<br/>3:45 PM<p>The near-tropical weather three Sundays ago proved to be an aberration.<p>Since that day, the temperature outside had dropped steadily. On the streets, thin jackets<br/>were gradually replaced by heavy coats and scarves as people went about their daily<br/>business, and when it rained one night last week there were thin strips of ice on the road<br/>the next morning. Tokyo had yet to see snow this year, but in the rustling of the bald<br/>branches all over town you could hear the promise that it wouldn't be long in coming.<p>On this afternoon, when a particularly harsh wind was busy scraping small garbage down<br/>the sidewalks and tearing posters from lampposts and telephone poles, and not a few<br/>children wearing wool hats and puffy-looking jackets clattered their teeth from behind a<br/>pair of mittens, Saotome Ranma, in a black overcoat with a white scarf around his neck,<br/>was making his way back home in a hurry. A year of practice in socialization had at least<br/>taught him to dress accordingly for the weather if he didn't want to stand out like a sore<br/>thumb in a crowd, like the first time he showed up to teach lessons part-time at the piano<br/>store nearby in his sleeveless red silk shirt and black kung-fu pants. However, that didn't<br/>mean that he had to like what he was wearing. It made him feel almost unbearably hot.<p>He had nearly made it past the small outdoor basketball court behind his apartment<br/>building before the sight of a pair of shapely legs stopped him in his tracks, if only for the<br/>fact that they were noticeably not covered by any piece of clothing under a wind that'd<br/>make most people wish they had been wearing their blankets on the way to work. He<br/>slowly traced his gaze from the ground up.<p>Hmm, a pair of white sneakers, check. Looks pretty new. Short socks, check. Bare legs<br/>with a bit of varicose veins, check… wait, how far up does the flesh go? Never mind, got<br/>a flower-print mini-skirt there, check. A piece of ass that would've won awards<br/>compared to even his better-figured fiancées back in Nerima, check…<p>I can't believe I just thought that, Ranma shook his head and mentally berated himself<br/>before going back to his brief inspection.<p>Red, silk blouse underneath a plain white spring jacket, check. Green hair that went<br/>down the back past the shoulders, check. Slender neck, connected to a slightly angular<br/>chin, check. Round, full lips blooming blood-red from the lipstick, check. Nose that<br/>conveyed an impression of nobility, check. Red irises staring intently back at him, check.<p>"Long time no see," Setsuna said, full lips curving slightly upward at the ends into a<br/>small smile.<p>x x x<p>"M-Meiou-san?" Ranma asked, startled. She nodded eagerly. He looked at her again. It<br/>was hard to picture that the smiling woman in front of him was the distraught bride-to-be<br/>who nearly smashed his piano three weeks ago on her wild manhunt.<p>"How did the wedding go?" He asked. Then, flashing her a grin, he said, "Should I call<br/>you 'Yamaguchi-san' now?"<p>"Yamaguchi," she agreed, before adding softly to the side, "if I were married, that is."<p>Not catching the last part, Ranma carried on with the small talk. "Oh… congratulations<br/>then. So, what brings you here to the neighborhood?"<p>"Oh, that…" her serene composure slipped slightly as she tried to come up with an<br/>answer. "I was just wandering around town." Then, smiling again, she said, "I was<br/>surprised to bump into you just now."<p>The pigtailed young man nodded. "Right." Then, taking off the scarf and tugging at the<br/>collar of his shirt under the coat uncomfortably, he said, "Um, sorry, I've got to go now.<br/>Nice to meet you though."<p>"Ah." Setsuna said, nodding. "Goodbye." She waved a hand at him.<p>"Bye," he mimicked her and waved, before turning back and went on around the corner<br/>to the front of the building. She trailed behind him for a few more steps. "Goodbye," she<br/>said, still waving.<p>"Er, right. Bye." He turned around once more and headed inside.<p>x x x<p>Ranma had barely time to kick off his shoes and hang up his coat before the doorbell rang.<br/>Frowning, he closed the closet and reached for the door. "Who the – Meiou-san?" Again?<br/>Didn't she say goodbye to him outside already? "Uh, what can I do for you?"<p>Still smiling, Setsuna took out two thousand-yen notes from her purse. "I forgot to pay<br/>you back."<p>"You don't have to –" Ranma's protest was cut off as she reached over and placed the<br/>bills squarely inside the breast pocket of his shirt. "–um, thanks, I guess," he said tiredly,<br/>sensing that arguing the matter would probably end up being another waste of time.<br/>Hopefully she would go now that she'd finished with her business. She smiled brightly.<p>And she was still standing outside.<p>Seeing that she still didn't intend to leave yet, he started. "Uh," he said, a bit<br/>uncomfortably, "I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of changing, so…" he trailed off, hoping<br/>that the unspoken request was plain enough.<p>"Oh... okay." He sighed in relief at that, and made a move to close the door.<p>x x x<p>"What – what in the world are you doing?" He asked, grunting to keep the door closed.<br/>The woman was surprisingly strong.<p>"Asking you a favor," she replied between gasps, trying to gain more leverage and<br/>squeeze through the opening her leg had made in the doorway.<p>Momentarily speechless, Ranma shot back as he recovered. "This is how you always ask<br/>for favors?"<p>"You don't understand!" By now, any hint of the Setsuna who was calmly smiling at<br/>everything outside his apartment had utterly vanished; in her stead was the maniacal<br/>woman he remembered all too well from their first encounter.<p>"I don't want to under–" he started to yell back, but was surprised by a horn blaring from<br/>just outside the window. Setsuna put his temporary distraction to good use and wrestled<br/>past him. "The movers," she said quickly, heading straight to the window. Somewhere<br/>along the line, Ranma had discovered that this whole thing was starting to feel very<br/>familiar.<p>She lifted the screen up and looked down. Three middle-aged men stood by the side of<br/>the road behind a small truck. Next to them on the sidewalk was a large sofa they'd<br/>unloaded already. "Hey, lady!" One of them looked up at her and yelled. "Where are<br/>we going to put all this?"<p>"Give me a minute," she yelled out at them, "I'm taking care of it right now!" She<br/>ducked back inside.<p>x x x<p>"…And then?" Ranma had settled himself down on the couch, regarding the woman<br/>pacing about animatedly in the living room. This could take a while, he thought. He<br/>absently noted that instead of circles, she was walking in squares this time.<p>"What else? I went back, and he was a no-show," Setsuna grounded out, eyes blazing,<br/>nostrils flaring, hands on her hips, her posture strikingly close to that of a disgruntled<br/>housewife. "I told my folks that Takuya's little sister –"<p>"He has a sister?"<p>"No, but they didn't know that." She waved a hand dismissively and continued.<br/>"Anyway, his sister – who's supposed to be kind of retarded, by the way, drove her car<br/>into a ditch on her way here, and since she lived out west in the country where the buses<br/>would take forever to get to Tokyo, she figured she could walk into the middle of a<br/>railroad crossing and hail down a train instead."<p>Ranma twitched an eyebrow. "And then?"<p>"…so now she's in a coma in the hospital, and he canceled the wedding at the last<br/>moment to see her when he found out about it."<p>"…And your people bought all that crap?"<p>"It took a little convincing, but they more or less swallowed the thing. Plus," she added,<br/>"I told them I was going to the hospital to see him and his sister and left before anybody<br/>could think of tagging along."<p>"What about his folks? Didn't anybody show up from Takuya's side?"<p>"We didn't invite them, and they wouldn't come anyway. He split up with his parents<br/>ages ago, and he's got no other relatives. But that's not the point," Setsuna said, bringing<br/>the topic back on track. "The point is, I forgot that I've given him my whole bank<br/>account earlier to help foot the expense since he told me he was going to handle all the<br/>planning, and by the time I got back home I found out that my account's been cleaned<br/>out."<p>"And then?"<p>"And then I got kicked out of my apartment," she said anticlimactically. "Since I was<br/>going to move in with him, I thought I'd terminate my apartment lease early and so I<br/>gave the landlord the notice last month, and when I told her after the wedding that I was<br/>going to stay, she told me that she's already signed the lease with the new tenants and<br/>that I have to leave by today."<p>"…And then?"<p>"And I thought I could live with a friend from work for a while, but she's married already<br/>and she told me their place was really small, and the walls were really thin…"<p>"…And then?"<p>"And then I remembered you. So I thought, hey, this is perfect; you've got an empty<br/>room, and I've got a bunch of furniture. So I told the movers to come here."<p>Ranma rubbed his temples.<p>Sensing that he was on the edge of caving in, Setsuna decided to go for the kill. "On top<br/>of that," she said pitifully, a sniffle all of a sudden working its way into her voice, "I just<br/>realized that today is my birthday, and I don't even have enough money to buy a cake."<p>"…Are you pulling my leg?" He asked.<p>"No, honest," she said, "It's my birthday today."<p>She took a peek at him. He had his head buried in his hands.<p>"Hey, lady!" The men from down below suddenly yelled out again. They'd been waiting<br/>for nearly twenty minutes now, and their patience was wearing thin. "Your furniture!"<p>Setsuna poked her head out of the window, a contented smile on her face. She held a<br/>thumb up triumphantly.<p>The workers cheered.<p>.<br/>2<br/>October 29, 1997<br/>9:29 PM<p>Ranma eyed the damage.<p>An extra couch – a nylon-cushioned two-seater in some wacky deco style – sat next to his<br/>own in the living room.<p>Twelve – he counted – ladies' coats of varying lengths, colors, and fashions, in the closet.<br/>He had two. His old roommate's favorite raincoat was moved far to the other end of the<br/>hanger.<p>Twelve pairs of shoes to match the jackets. Out of the dozen, eleven were pumps. The<br/>remaining one was the pair of white sneakers she wore. More than half of them were left<br/>out by the foyer in neat display rows because his one-row shoe rack couldn't fit.<p>On top of that, ten wooden crates of… something, stacked five-high by the wall between<br/>the bathroom and Takuya's old bedroom.<p>Bound, old issues of magazines, ranging from fashion to wedding to modeling to<br/>maternity to contemporary physics, lying everywhere on the floor.<p>He didn't even want to think of what her room looked like. How the movers got that<br/>huge grand-oak dresser in and still found space to dump the mattress and table and three<br/>standing lamps in the same hundred-square-feet area, he had no idea.<p>Finally, his eyes fell upon the other occupant of the room.<p>Setsuna, sprawled out on her sofa, head falling backward and arms draping the cushions,<br/>an opened issue of Modern Physics covering her face, was looking right at home. She<br/>wriggled her toes.<p>"…um, Meiou-san?" he asked weakly.<p>Setsuna slowly brought her head forward, letting the magazine fall to the floor. "Hmm?<br/>Oh, right, I know. This only lasts until I get a good enough job that I can live by myself,<br/>or somehow find a cheap place I can live in." She yawned, then belatedly brought up a<br/>hand to cover it. "Sorry. It's been a long day."<p>Ranma stared. "The movers did all the work, you know?"<p>She shrugged. "I got tired just watching them move. Besides, I'm relaxing for them.<br/>I'm sure they'd appreciate it."<p>She picked herself off the couch and stretched, fussing her hair with one hand. Then,<br/>suddenly remembering something, she looked at him curiously. "Say, Saotome-san," she<br/>asked, "you said the other day that you couldn't go through with the wedding because<br/>you've got something back home…" she trailed off, a finger tapping her chin in thought.<br/>"So, what is it? A girlfriend?"<p>"A fiancée," he stopped himself too late and said.<p>Setsuna nodded appreciatively. "I see…" she smiled a little teasing smile. "I was<br/>wondering why a good looking young man like you weren't attached in any way."<p>Ranma shrank back instinctively, honed by years of experience from dealing with hoards<br/>of females waiting to drag him off to the altar the moment he let down his guard. "Hey!<br/>Don't get any ideas."<p>"As if." She waved a hand, a gesture that he was becoming accustomed to by now. "I<br/>don't go for younger men."<p>Feeling somehow slighted, Ranma's old ego resurfaced and prompted him for a retort.<br/>"Perfect," he said, "I don't go for older women either. On the other hand," he added,<br/>smirking, "it's a different story if the girl is classy, beautiful, and mature."<p>Her smile frozen on her face, Setsuna's eyes flashed dangerously for a moment. Then,<br/>realizing that she's been led off-track, she recovered instantly and pressed on. "Anyway,<br/>about that fiancée… is she cute?"<p>Ranma stiffened. He wasn't going to slip up again. "I don't want to talk about it," he<br/>said guardedly.<p>"Come on," she pressed again, trying to test how far she could push the button, "you can<br/>tell me… what's it like? Love at first sight?"<p>"I said, 'I don't want to talk about it,'" he repeated, louder this time.<p>"Pfeh," she said, "It's not like it's a big deal. After all, we're going to be living together,<br/>so we might as well get to know each other a little. Unless…" she trailed off, feigning<br/>shock. "Unless you're cheating on her?"<p>Ranma gaped at the woman. Letting her stay was one thing, this was another. "Are you<br/>always this pushy?" He asked heatedly, the stress of the whole day getting the better of<br/>him. "It's no wonder Takuya left you." Not seeing the stunned expression on her face,<br/>he went on. "I mean, I already had to put up with you barging in here and all, not to<br/>mention all the stuff you brought with you, but this –" he looked at her, finally aware that<br/>the other end of the living room had gone completely quiet.<p>Outside, a drizzle started.<p>"I see." Setsuna said finally, all warmth and earlier mirth devoid on her face. She<br/>walked into her new room, and came back out a few seconds later with a purse in hand.<p>Knowing that he had just put his foot in his mouth yet again, Ranma asked with a mixture<br/>of dread and apology in his voice, "Uh, what are you doing?"<p>Sliding the closet door open, Setsuna picked out the white jacket she wore earlier. "I'm<br/>moving out," she said matter-of-factly without looking at him. She stepped into her<br/>sneakers, jamming her heels into the shoes when her feet wouldn't go in instantly.<br/>"Thank you for putting up with me," she said, bowing formally. "I apologize for the<br/>intrusion. I'll pick up the rest of my stuff tomorrow."<p>Ranma ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "But… you just moved in today!" He<br/>protested, only to be left with a perfect view of the empty stairs outside through the open<br/>door.<p>x x x<p>Damned crazy chick, he thought. Who did she think she was, taking off like that after he<br/>told her to mind her own business? For that matter, who did she think she was, coming<br/>here in the first place and dumping all her stuff in his apartment?<p>Not my fault, he said to himself. Not my fault that she got dumped; not my fault that she<br/>should be eating her birthday cake with Takuya somewhere off in god-knows-where on<br/>their honeymoon right now. This was not my fault.<p>The rain seemed to agree. It began to pour.<p>He peered through the window. She had turned the corner and was walking down<br/>towards the basketball court with her head down. Her suit was wet, and her dark green<br/>hair clung to her jacket like a damp mop.<p>I'm not going out there, he thought.<p>x x x<p>"Meiou-san!" Ranma called out, carefully keeping his head inside the apartment as he<br/>opened the window.<p>Setsuna stopped, not looking up. "What?"<p>"You're going to catch a cold," he said. "Come back."<p>She took another step forward.<p>"Wait!" He yelled again.<p>She paused. "Now what?"<p>"It's raining," he pointed out.<p>Setsuna shut her eyes in irritation. An empty soda can left out as trash on the sidewalk<br/>crumpled under her foot. She gave it a good kick, and kept on walking.<p>The can of Pepsi clattered noisily on the pavement. Nearby, startled by the commotion, a<br/>few doves took to the air from the wire they were perching upon, squawking their<br/>objection all the way.<p>x x x<p>(Who the hell just did that?)<br/>(Geez, as if the rain wasn't enough… Dammit, I'm trying to sleep!)<br/>(Hey, it's that woman from a few weeks ago.)<br/>(You mean…)<p>(…)<p>(Well, what are we going to do about it?)<p>.<br/>3<br/>October 29, 1997<br/>9:38 PM<p>Outside, by the vacant basketball court, Setsuna wiped a hand angrily across her face to<br/>clear out the rain. This was turning out to be one of the worst birthdays she could ever<br/>remember.<p>Not even a month earlier, she had indulged herself in some sweet thoughts about<br/>candlelight dinners, whispers by the fireside, and not a few snuggles in the dark. It was<br/>not some thoughts that should have rightfully belonged to her, but back then she had<br/>already resigned to live her life out as a normal person and was caught in the moment,<br/>awash in giddiness with the prospect of getting married. Like a normal person.<p>Letting a dry laugh escape from her throat, Setsuna picked up her feet and resumed<br/>walking.<p>Well, the birthday's shot, she thought as she started down the sidewalk once more,<br/>picking out all the things that had gone wrong in the past month with her fingers. The<br/>wedding's gone, too. So was the bank account. And my stuff's still back there as well.<p>At least I have a birthday song playing.<p>Her feet carried her a few paces further before they came to a halt.<p>Wait, a birthday song?<p>x x x<p>Inside the apartment, Ranma let his fingers linger on the keys for the last note before<br/>drawing them away.<p>He started another song.<p>x x x<p>The dim light from the lampposts cast a long shadow on the sidewalk, set upon the paler<br/>shades of crisscrossing wires that had been there earlier in the night.<p>Leaning against the fence by the empty court, Setsuna listened to the music floating past<br/>the windows down the streets below. It wasn't any tune that she recognized, but that<br/>didn't matter in the slightest. As unfamiliar as she was with music, Setsuna could<br/>immediately see the skill of the player behind the song; the way the notes went crisp and<br/>poignant even as the melody climbed into a maddeningly complex crescendo, then<br/>streamed out in a gentle flow as the tension dispersed spoke of the level of mastery<br/>needed to execute the piece.<p>More, the music sang to her. It was not quite like the jazzy pieces she heard Haruka play,<br/>seemingly a lifetime ago, and not quite like the classical songs with regular beats and<br/>cadence that her boss sometimes listened to at work; it was a strange and pleasant blend<br/>of both – formal, like sunset, and free-flowing, like the last cloud that chased the sun over<br/>the horizon and into the night. Memories of Sailor Pluto flashed by her eyes, and she was<br/>suddenly there – at the palace, in the ballroom, the grand gala commencing as dusk<br/>settled in the sky outside the mosaic glass panes. She was standing, as usual, alone in the<br/>crowd, keeping a sharp eye on the various nobilities and dignitaries in the court, watching<br/>the other senshi waltz by her, waiting for the slightest gesture from the Queen to appear<br/>at her side and do her bidding. And the song, pushing past the throng, found her this time,<br/>made a formal bow and extended a hand. May I have this dance? It asked.<p>She closed her eyes.<p>I've traded my chance at marriage and my bank account for two birthday songs, a<br/>thought came to her impulsively. Then, realizing the ridiculousness of the thought, and a<br/>little surprised at how un-bitter she was at it even if it were true, she smiled.<p>The trickling of the last few notes ebbed away as the song faded to a stop. Apology<br/>accepted, she thought fondly, but perhaps this was for the best. Goodbye, Saotome-san.<p>Refreshed, and not a bit disappointed, Setsuna let her eyes open again and gingerly<br/>pushed herself away from the fence. A sudden, unwarranted sense of confidence surged<br/>through her, and she started down the road once more, ready to take on whatever<br/>challenges that life would throw at her again.<p>She was not ready, however, for a wing in her face.<p>.<br/>4<br/>October 29, 1997<br/>9:58 PM<p>The door to the apartment was yanked open, then slammed shut in an instant.<p>"You're back," Ranma grunted from the bench.<p>Setsuna was too busy trying to recover her breath to make any coherent replies, however.<br/>With feathers in her wet hair, a few scratches and tears on her white jacket, and some bird<br/>droppings mixed in with the rainwater on her face, she took a few gasps of air before she<br/>started screaming at him. "There were some crazy homicidal birds out there trying to kill<br/>me!" She pointed at the door in shocked outrage and said, clearly frightened.<p>Then, after she had feverishly patted away the last traces of her recent avian assault,<br/>Setsuna calmed down considerably. Trying to muster whatever anger she harbored from<br/>earlier at the young man at the piano, she drew a curious blank, which she noted was an<br/>unacceptable answer. She finally settled with crossing her arms in front of her chest and<br/>a neutral expression on her face. "Anyway," she said, concentrating to maintain the<br/>frown she wore on her face, "I thought you said you don't like to play for anybody in<br/>particular."<p>Ranma paused in thought. "…I make exceptions for birthdays." He said at last. Then,<br/>fully taking note of her current state, he added, barely stifling a laugh, "Bathroom's down<br/>that way."<p>x x x<p>Outside, an hour later, the downpour showed no sign of slowing down anytime soon.<p>A few birds were dancing on the sidewalk.<p>(Wahahahaha, did you see the look on her face when I caught her with that uppercut?<br/>Sho-ryu-ken, baby, sho-ryu-ken!)<br/>(C'mon, let's go! My feathers are all drenched.)<br/>(Hmm. Well, that explains where that other piece of poppy seed mochi went. On the<br/>other hand, though, I did manage to get past that constipation problem I've been having<br/>lately. They just don't make bread crumbs like they used to.)<br/>(Screw the crumbs! Did you see, eh, did you see? I bitch-slapped her good! Hahahaha!<br/>Tatsumaki-sempuu-kya–)<br/>(All right, we get the idea! Let's go!)<p>The lights from the third floor window grew faint, then slowly went out. Beyond the<br/>heavy rain, and the few celebratory cries and sounds of flapping wings intermittently<br/>throughout the night, it was a relatively quiet evening in the neighborhood.<p>(END CHAPTER)<p>.<br/>Special thanks to: Figment again, and Thermopyle as well for pre-read and excellent<br/>suggestions on how to approach the piano scene near the end.<p>- ukie
