</div>I should probably type up the next couple chapters and get them out to<br/>my prereader, ne? Mei already knows they've been written... I just<br/>haven't _typed_ any of them to send to her. Uhm... oops?<p>No D&amp;D here, either Ayden. But there _will_ be some destruction in<br/>Chapter Twenty. And some mindless evil, but then, that's what Yuki<br/>does best.<p>Ran - Big Sister. Yuki's nineteen, Ranma's sixteen.<p>Yuki was designed mostly by Mei Neko with a few twists ala me. She<br/>actually has a (large) role to play in one of the future books.<br/>^_^ I didn't have anyone else who could play the part, so I might<br/>as well introduce her in the second book, ne?<p>True Identity<br/>Chapter Nineteen - Waiting<br/>Li Xiang<p>"Ah... hello?"<p>Nephrite was not used to answering the door. He had been a prince of<br/>one of the Four Kingdoms before they had been united under the House<br/>of Endymion, followed by a general in Endymion's army, then became one<br/>of the Lords of the Revolution when Beryl attacked the moon. In other<br/>words, he had always been the one who had people answer the door for<br/>him. Definitely not used to answering the door.<p>"Hi!" chirped a female voice, from behind the elegant, kimono-clad<br/>woman at the door. Said elegant woman rolled her eyes, and then smiled<br/>at Nephrite.<p>"You must be new to the House. I am Saotome Nodoka."<p>"Ranma's mother?"<p>"Yes," she nodded, and Nephrite stepped aside, allowing her and the<br/>two girls behind her in. He closed the door behind him, turning to eye<br/>the trio carefully.<p>There was Nodoka, followed by a younger girl, sixteen or seventeen,<br/>he'd wager, and the third female was approximately nineteen. He<br/>wondered, briefly, who they were, then shook his head, "I'll see if<br/>Ranma is... available."<p>The reason for his hesitation was obvious to Nodoka, but then, she<br/>knew her son. The other two eyed him oddly, before Nodoka motioned for<br/>them to follow her in.<p>"Nice place," the older girl spoke, and the younger nodded her<br/>agreement.<p>"Ranma spent a lot on it," Nodoka told them with a smile, "Now, the<br/>living room is this way."<p>They followed her, taking in the sight of the warehouse come<br/>mansion-of-a-sort. They passed a number of doors with name plates on<br/>them, obviously bedrooms. There was 'Yohji'- which had 'Playboy'<br/>taped under it- 'Schuldich', 'Rache', 'Ken'- and his read 'Ghostie'<br/>under it in English- 'Crawford', 'Oz, 'Fei Li', 'Nobuyuki'- someone<br/>had taped that "do-not-cross" police line all over his door-<br/>'Nephrite/Kunzite', 'Zoicite'/'Jadaeite', 'Jei'- which had 'Farfello'<br/>scratched over it, and there were tons of locks on the door- 'Ranma',<br/>and finally 'Aya'. The youngest of the group blinked.<p>"There's someone here with my name?"<p>"Indeed," Nodoka smiled mysteriously, and the two girls following her<br/>exchanged a look between them. There was something going on here...<p>-<p>At that particular moment, Ranma was not even _in_ the House. He,<br/>dressed in a pair of black overalls, and a red t-shirt, was glaring at<br/>his reflection, "This isn't funny."<p>"It's not supposed to be," came Abyssian's voice, "This is one thing<br/>Farfello and I agree on-"<p>"-You have enough copies of the same outfit," Farfello finished with<br/>a smug look, "You need different clothes."<p>"I have enough!" Ranma complained.<p>"For your female form," Aya bit out, "Not for your male form."<p>"But Ayan..." when he could see _this_ was not getting anywhere, he<br/>tried something else, "...Jei-sama..."<p>"Kitty," was Farfello's warning growl, "You control the change now.<br/>You aren't getting away with 'but I might change!'"<p>Ranma thought it was seriously unfair. He had control of his shape<br/>now- the Ginzoushou had warped his curse. That black mist might have<br/>done it, but he doubt that. The smoke-like substance preferred to fix<br/>him, but it had never touched the curse before.<p>It was even more unfair that Aya had surprised him at breakfast by<br/>announcing that he was taking Ranma to get new clothes for his male<br/>side. To the astonishment of the everyone present at the time, Jei had<br/>agreed.<p>Of course, he had also said that he would be accompanying them. So<br/>here they were, two men who would gladly fight each other until they<br/>bled to death, forcing him into new clothing. It wasn't fair!<p>"Life's not fair," Aya responded.<p>"I said that out loud?"<p>Jei grinned, "Yes."<p>One of the salesladies hesitantly came closer. Jei's fearsome visage<br/>had terrified them; so many scars... they littered his face! The<br/>epitome of bad luck- and he even had to wear an eyepatch.<p>"Si-si-sir? W-w-will yo-you be bu-bu-buying tha-that outfit?"<p>"No," Ranma grumped, "I hate it. C'mon Ayan, Jei-sama! I look like a<br/>little kid!"<p>The saleslady had skittered away at his outburst, and he glowered<br/>evilly at his reflection, then at his two 'supervisors'.<p>By the time they had left, Ranma had two sweaters, three pairs of<br/>jeans, and three t-shirts. He had refused everything else.<p>As pay back, Ranma had shifted to his female form, and forced them to<br/>carry 'her' bags. Neither Farfello nor Aya were all to pleased with<br/>that, but they got stuck with it, as the redhead had pouted at them.<p>Both men were feeling a bit antsy, and definitely... strange, was the<br/>best way to put it, as they walked back to the House. They had not<br/>fought _all_ _day_! Freaky.<p>They decided to remedy that by tripping each other up as they walked.<br/>It was an odd scene to come across, no doubt. Two 'grown' men<br/>childishly tripping one another, then racing to catch up with a pretty<br/>redhead in Chinese silks.<p>Ranma-onna grinned to herself. This seemed so much like that water<br/>fight they had prior to killing Muu Tsu and Khu Lon- minus the water,<br/>and the fact that it had been at night. Ah... memories...<p>-<p>The Sailor Senshi gathered, nervousness filling them. They were losing<br/>numbers far to quickly for their tastes. Saturn had vanished sometime<br/>during the night.<p>So Usagi, Minako, Rei, Haruka and Michiru had come to meet in front of<br/>the arcade. Naru had plead fatigue so as not to come; apparently, she<br/>and her mysterious boyfriend had gone out on a double date with a few<br/>outside-the-Senshi-friends, and had been up pretty late.<p>Haruka did not like it that Naru had friends outside the Senshi. It<br/>was not right; outside-friends meant Charon's devotion was not solely<br/>to their princess- but she failed to mention it out loud. The<br/>Princess would have gotten pissed off at her.<p>They were so worried; Jupiter and Mercury missing, and presumed<br/>captives of Amun-Ra, Saturn and Pluto both missing without reason,<br/>Apollo converted to Bastet, and Charon mess over losing her best<br/>friend. Things were not looking to hot for them. They needed an ace in<br/>the hole. They needed-<p>"Would you two stop acting like little kids?"<p>-Horus to show up in civies to chastise Osiris, Bastet and Ptah? The<br/>three mentioned were also wearing civies, not to mention carrying<br/>bags.<p>The Senshi did a double take, creeping closer to listen in on their<br/>enemies. Maybe they would find something useful!<p>Unfortunately, Ranma- or 'Bastet' to them- had sensed the group of<br/>eavesdroppers. She tilted her head in their direction, flicking her<br/>eyes to them, in a subtle motion that only 'Horus' saw, "Oh, take that<br/>stick out of your ass, 'Rus. Pahn and Cyrus were just having some<br/>fun..."<p>Aya and Jei gave her confused looks, and she whispered, "Senshi" as<br/>Yohji responded, "Tripping each other? Xue Shi, that's a childish<br/>game, not having 'fun'."<p>"Hey, you said it, 'Rus. It's a _game_ and therefore, _fun_."<p>"Anyone ever tell you that you have some twisted logic?"<p>"I-chan used to..." Bastet actually appeared to be upset, "But then<br/>she had to turn out _not_ to be Isis-chan but an enemy..."<p>The Senshi got the feeling that had she the ears of the animals she<br/>patroned, they would be dropping with depression. Maybe the reason<br/>that they _had not_ been attacked recently was because the enemy was<br/>having personal problems?<p>No, that could not be it, as Bastet had shaken off the depression far<br/>to quickly for it to have been a real problem, "Any ways, why'd you<br/>come here, 'Rus?"<p>'Rus sighed, "Visitors and what not. Actually, I was, and I quote<br/>this, told to "Find Ay-Cyrus and Xue Shi, and drag them home". Our<br/>lovely friend Lady Raven decided to pay a visit."<p>"So why's she looking for us redheads?" wondered Ranma-onna, finally<br/>cluing Aya and Jei in on whose name was whose.<p>The Senshi crept even closer. Who was this... "Lady Raven"? Isis had<br/>to have been Charon in disguise- she had said something about that<br/>before, hadn't she?- but Lady Raven was an unknown.<p>Yohji gave his friend/rival/whatever the hell she was, an odd look,<br/>"Isn't it obvious, she wants to talk to you!"<p>"Sometimes, 'Rus, you can be such an idiot."<p>"Who are you trying to kid?" 'Pahn' interrupted, "Ku-'Rus is always<br/>an idiot."<p>Haruka and Michiru exchanged significant looks. That was the second<br/>time they had been about to say something else. What were they going<br/>to say, though? Their real names? Did that mean that 'Cyrus' and 'Rus'<br/>were fake names? The quartet of 'evil-doers' moved off, Cyrus making<br/>some snide comment about the pot calling the kettle black, to Pahn.<br/>The white haired man glowered at him, and Cyrus returned it full<br/>force.<p>The five Senshi ran after them, but once the four had turned a corner,<br/>they were gone. If the Senshi had done one of two things, they would<br/>have found the quartet. They could have looked up, and seen the four<br/>roof hopping away.<p>Or, they could have listened to the whispers of the crowd, which would<br/>have caused them to look up, any ways. However, they did neither,<br/>automatically assuming that the 'enemy' had teleported away.<p>So the meeting was brought back to Hikawa Jinga in order to think on<br/>this new development.<p>Who, praytell, was Lady Raven?<p>-<p>End Chapter<p>No, I'm not mentally unbalanced. Why do you ask?<p>Oh, and a very special treat, a ficlet by Mei Neko! And yes, I _know_<br/>it's nearing Christmas, but c'mon! This Halloween ficlet is cool<p>The Halloween Ficlet<p>"You got to be kidding me..." Oz muttered as he stared at himself.<br/>How did he get into this mess agian? Oh yeah, a certain pyscopath<br/>threaten to lock him in his animal form. And why did this certain<br/>psycopath wanted to do this? Oh right! Sibling bonding and free<br/>candy. And how the hell are they going to be able to pull this off?<br/>He really did not want to find out.<p>A knock and the sound ofthe door being slammed open caught the poor<br/>guy's attention. Standing there was a girl with long black hair<br/>wearing a costume taht made her look like Vampire Hunter D. She gave<br/>a grin and chuckled.<p>"Man, I knew the costume I picked out for you was awesome! Hey,<br/>Aya-chan! Look at Oz man! Or should we say Robin!" Vampire Hunter D<br/>cried out in glee.<p>A Tomoyo from CCS came in with her camera and giggled. She was<br/>recording the whole thing.<p>"You both look so cool!" Aya said cheerfully. Oz gave a sour look at<br/>that.<p>"How come I have to be Robin? Why does Crawford get to be Batman?" Oz<br/>asked glaring at the two.<p>"Because we all know that Batman hasn't been getting any for the<br/>longest time and that's the same as Brad. Brad can stay in<br/>character." was the answer from the taller girl.<p>"Oneechan! Why? Why the hell am I dressed like this?"<p>Oz looked past the two girls and turned away to prevent himself from<br/>laughing his ass off at the sight. He so did not want ot be dead.<p>"Because you look so cute! Plus, your boyfriends like it very much!"<br/>Yuki said grinning as she bounced around her little sibling.<p>Ranma was wearing the outfit for Hikaru in Angelic Layer. Yuki<br/>thought it looked cute. Jei-sama liked it. Aya-kun was trying to pry<br/>his eyes off. Most of the straight males were trying not to drool.<br/>Aya-chan was recording this. Yuki was going to pay for<br/>this...someday.<p>"But of course we have someone to acompany you on this! Look at the<br/>lovely looking Naru! You look awesome as Blanche! White looks good<br/>on you!" Yuki cheered. Naru gave a smile. At least her costume<br/>wasn't as tight fitting as Ranma's. Besides, she only wanted one guy<br/>to drool all over her...<p>"Yeah! Naru looks good! Jei-sama looks good! Ken looks good! Hell!<br/>Even playboy looks better then me!" Ranma ranted. Aya-chan looked<br/>around to see a Captin Hook, Farelleo, grinning and waving his fake<br/>hook. Ken was blushing and trying ot keep Schudlich's hands off him<br/>since he was wearing a Green Arrow costume. As for Yohji, Naru picked<br/>out a Gambit costume. It fit his character quite well.<p>"You're right, Yohji does look good in his costume. But then, look at<br/>Ran! He's wearing that lovely kimono...really Aya, I still think we<br/>should have made him wear the school girl uniform. He really would<br/>look like an awesome Ryoko!" (Real Bout High) Yuki whinned. Aya gave<br/>a giggled.<p>"But I don't like the idea of my brother getting hit on more then me!"<br/>Aya teased while Yuki grumbled something that sounded like 'that was<br/>the whole point of it...'<p>Ran gave a really nasty glare at Yuki. It was her fault for this<br/>whole thing. Her fault that he was dressed in a kimono like Yuki from<br/>Furit Basket. He swore that after this was through, he would go after<br/>those manga artists.<p>"Well, well, well...I guess we should hurry this up...Crawman and<br/>Nagikins are getting a tad bit annoyed with us." Schudlich, dressed as<br/>Hiro of Gravitation, gave a big grin. The Batman and Nightwing were<br/>glaring at him. "Really Yuki, why did you give Oz the Robin costume?<br/>I would think that Nagi should have taken it."<p>"Beats me...they only have a Nightwing costume for Nagi's size.<br/>Besides, at least Nobu gets to have some fun as Vadar! Of course Fei<br/>man is our wonderful Wufei of Gundam Wing! WAHAHAHAHA!" Yuki said<br/>laughing and rollling on the ground.<p>"Damn you Omi! How the hell did he get out of this?" Nagi growled.<br/>Ranma glared at Yuki.<p>"Omi gave her a credit card that she could use without paying a single<br/>bill. And Nabiki got her tons of candy." Ranma snarled. Yuki looked<br/>up and had a rather hurt face.<p>"Really, my own brother thinks that I would let candy take over me! I<br/>made her do the Chicken dance before she gave me candy." Yuki said.<p>"What! Do you got that on record?" Ranma asked. Yuki gave a nod.<p>"Emailed it out to everyone as a virus. It'll take a while for her to<br/>fix it. Anyway, let's go and get some candy! Halloween is the nest<br/>holiday of the year...with the exception to Christmas...and<br/>Thanksgiving...and..."<p>"YUKI, SHUT UP!"<p>-<p>That was from the ever wonderful Mei Neko.<p>You guys can send me ficlets too. Email's  ^_^
