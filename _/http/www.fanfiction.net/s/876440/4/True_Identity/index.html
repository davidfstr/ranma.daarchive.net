</div>Ah _Krypt_ you know me so well, don't you? *grins*<p>Eike... wow, that's... that's... wow, I've never had a compliment like<br/>that before. I feel special now. Thank you sooooo much! *give Eike a "I<br/>love True/False Identity badge* There! Now you can show it off to all<br/>your friends! (Hmmm... maybe I'll make one of those and put it up on<br/>Faded Fantasies. Hmmm...)<p>Anyways, school starts in a week. We all know what that means...<p>... Li Xiang writes better, of course! *shrugs* I've never figured out<br/>why I write better during school, but it happens. Oh well. Hrm, on that<br/>note (that I'm going back to classes) I may be getting stuff up late,<br/>due to my father's need to have me only getting online over the weekends<br/>until my first report card. Evil man.<p>True Identity<br/>Chapter Three: Psuedo-senshi<br/>Li Xiang<p>"Nononononononononononono!" Ranma glared at her temporary teammates,<br/>where the four had gathered in her bedroom. It also happened to be the<br/>only trainning room in the building, and was used judicously by those<br/>who wanted to during the day. During the night it was considered<br/>offlimits, unless Ranma himself had granted entrance.<p>Right now, they were using the training room as the meeting room, Ranma<br/>seated on her bed, and the others on various training equipment.<p>Rache snorted, staring at her friend, "If I have to, you do."<p>"Can't we come up with a better plan?" Ranma-onna whined, staring<br/>pleadingly at the other woman, "Like, show up at their homes and kill<br/>them off?"<p>Nagi shook his head, frowning, "That won't work. The government will<br/>only look away if the Seerasenshi are dead. Anyone else, and they'll<br/>investiagte it. If we show up at their homes, we'll have to kill their<br/>families, too."<p>Schuldich nodded in agreement, "Not to mention that we're supposed to<br/>get all the senshi. And more and more just keep popping up."<p>"But I don't wanna wear a fuku!"<p>-<p>Fourteen years old was _not_ the best time to drift away from life long<br/>friends. Especially ones prone to depression.<p>Osaka Naru ran her fingers through her hair for the hundredth time that<br/>night, staring at the phone beside her bed. It did not ring. Not once.<br/>The green eyed redhead finally let tired eyes rest on the red numbers<br/>of her alarm clock, "Past midnight?"<p>She sighed, crawling under her covers, to let the tears burn down her<br/>cheeks and splatter harmlessly on her pillow.<p>For the tenth time in so many days, Usagi had broke her promise.<br/>Everyday the blonde swore she would call, but never did. Naru was<br/>beginning to think there was something wrong with her. Through bitter<br/>sobs, she ground out, "Oh sure, Rache, like anything was ever _right_<br/>about you."<p>Depression clung to her like a living thing, worrying at her mind,<br/>destroying her self confidence. She knew it was happening- she _had_<br/>gone through it twice before- but let it take control of her.<p>What good was a girl who's whole family, and all her friends, left her<br/>behind?<p>-<p>Night had fallen nearly three hours earlier, but one in Juuban park<br/>would not know it. Not with the brillant flares of magical power<br/>ripping the air apart, to impact against a seemingly iompervious foe.<br/>They had been battling for twenty minutes, without luck. Unlike<br/>previous enemies, this odd tin golem dodged the most powerful attacks,<br/>and was really only taking his from the faster, lesser power ones.<p>The Sailorsenshi were failing.<p>Not that that had been unexpected, Ranma reflected to herself, from her<br/>perch in a nearby tree. Even she had problems when fighting Nagi's<br/>telekenetically controlled "friends". The boy had taken up controlling<br/>the movements of numberous tin constructs over the months, sending them<br/>after Ranma. They were really training each other- Ranma was learning<br/>to fight opponents that didn't feel pain, weren't angered by insults,<br/>could stop in mid air and hover, and not to mention several other<br/>tricks the Naoe boy had thrown in. Nagi's powers, on the other hand,<br/>grew exponentially as he found himself controlling two, three, four at<br/>a time just to give Ranma the challenge he wanted.<p>Right now, he only had one to focus on, and could probably continue to<br/>manevuer the thing around for at the very least another hour. But that<br/>wasn't part of the plan. What was part of the plan was to introduce<br/>Ranma and Rache to the Sailorsenshi.<p>/In sentai-style, to boot,/ the redhead grumbled acidly to Schuldich.<br/>The telepath snickered in the back of her mind, but didn't respond.<p>The german and his japanese partner were hiding out on the roof of a<br/>near-by building, controlling the motions of the fight from there.<br/>Well, Nagi was. Schuldich was just monitoring the surprisingly<br/>unsheilded minds of the Sailorsenshi for the perfect moment to jump in.<br/>One when all the girls would be receptive to the help.<p>Not that Ranma really wanted to do this. She growlled low in her<br/>throat, and for the hundredth time since she'd taken up her seat,<br/>tugged at the hot pink bow at her back, with those irriating ribbons<br/>that tickled the backs of her legs.<p>/Schwester! Bishoujo!/<p>That was the only thing the two psuedo-senshi needed to enter the<br/>fight. Ranma launched herself up and out of the tree she was in, while<br/>Rache, who had been on the opposite side of the tree, dropped down to<br/>race across the ground.<p>"Outta the way, little ones," Rache barked, darting around them at her<br/>best speed- which was amplified by the fact that Nagi was gently<br/>tugging her forwards, too. Ranma hit the ground lightly, just as Rache<br/>came to a surprisingly abrupt halt- she told Schuldich to give Nagi<br/>her thanks- both standing between the golem and the out of breath<br/>Inner Senshi.<p>Said senshi got a good look at their saviors as the two girls stood<br/>back-to-back, and side ways. Both were redheads, although the one on<br/>the right had shorter hair, coming only to her chin, not like the<br/>shoulder-length locks of her companion. Her fuku colors were golden<br/>yellow thigh-high stilletto heels, a matching scarf and skirt, while<br/>her bows, glove piping, and choker were hot pink. The one on the left<br/>had pair of black platform heels, black bodysuit, black choaker, and<br/>black gloves. Her skirt and scarf were dark grey, her bows a paler, but<br/>still dark shade of the same tone. Neither girl wore tiaras, although<br/>the gold one had a gold tattoo of a star on her forehead, while the<br/>grey one had what appeared to be bandages wrapped around hers.<p>The grey one carried a long handled scimitar, while the other was bare<br/>handed.<p>Before Eternal Sailormoon could wonder who they were, they introduced<br/>themselves. Unknown to the girls, both Ranma and Rache had to be<br/>prompted by Schuldich for a few moments before they _did_ speak.<br/>Neither girl was really into this whole sentai-save-the-world type<br/>thing.<p>"Mistress of the dead world, taker of souls, Sailorcharon!"<p>"Mistress of the fire world, deliver of souls, Sailorapollo!"<p>Both 'Charon' and 'Apollo' managed to keep the digust at the cheesy<br/>intros off their faces, turning to face the tin golem. Apollo's eyes<br/>glinted dangerously, "But this walking Tin-can already knew that, eh<br/>Char?"<p>"If it's being controlled by who we think it is, then of course,<br/>'Pollo."<p>Apollo's face split with a wicked grin, and she launched herself<br/>forwards, Charon following at her heels. The dark senshi's blade bit<br/>into the golem, slicing the arm from it's body, and Apollo hit the<br/>separated limb with a blast of ki, turning it into so much dust. This<br/>was going to be fun.<p>After a few moments of slaughter, wherein Charon would cut parts off of<br/>the golem, and Apollo would blast them into oblivion, the two girls<br/>finally finished it off. A quick mental suggestion that Schuldich and<br/>Nagi flee was taken into account, and Ranma could feel their signatures<br/>leaving the area.<p>It was Sailormoon who approached them, "Who are you two? Are you here<br/>to help us?"<p>"Looks that way, don't it?" Ranma drawlled, looking up into the night<br/>sky, "Sailorapollo at y'er service."<p>"I am Sailorcharon," Rache introduced herself with a slight bow,<br/>"Pleasure to meet the fabled Senshi of Tokyo."<p>Mercury jumped in, then, recalling what the two girls had said about<br/>the tin golem, "You've fought creatures like that one," she waved at<br/>the piles of vaporized tin, "before?"<p>"We have," Charon nodded, trying to hold back a grin. It was more like<br/>they'd practised a few times to pull this off then come out here. But<br/>for this plot of their's to work... "We've been tracking these tyncha<br/>across the globe, attempting to get at their master. Unfortunately,<br/>he's a lot harder to defeat then these little pieces of trash."<p>"How did you defeat them so quickly, though?" Mercury was frowning.<br/>There was nothing magical, what-so-ever, about Charon's sword...<p>"Can't use magic to cut the things up," Apollo shrugged, "S'why Char<br/>here gets to be chop-happy with her scimitar, and I do the blasting<br/>into oblivion." Charon looked about ready to say something else when<br/>her yellow garbed partner stiffened, frowning, "look, we've gotta git.<br/>Both o'us have stuff ta do tommarra. Not to mention tonight..."<p>"I'd forgotten about that!" Charon turned to stare at her friend,<br/>"You've still got to meet up with the group tonight, don't you?"<p>"In about five minutes," Apollo agreed, "C'mon, I'm faster than you,<br/>even wit'cha on my back. Let's jet."<p>"I'm sure we'll meet again," Charon's smile was a bit mysterious as she<br/>piggy-backed on Apollo. Then, to the shock of the Inners, the two girls<br/>shot off as a mere blur.<p>"Wow..." Venus murmured, "I'd like to be able to run that fast."<p>-<p>Crawford hiked an eyebrow as the girls came in, followed by Schuldich,<br/>of whom was supporting a wobbly Nagi. Rache ignored the inquiring brow,<br/>heading straight for her bedroom, while Ranma gave the schwartz-<br/>correction, former schwartz- leader the evil eye and left. Crawford<br/>smirked, and Schuldich snickered, "Oh yeah, neither one of them will<br/>_ever_ want to talk to us again, Crawfish."<p>"They should know by now that assasination often includes<br/>infiltration."<p>"That doesn't mean they apprediate dressing up as a pedophiole's wet<br/>dream," Nagi forced himself to his feet, barely maing it to the<br/>common-room couch before he crashed. Keeping a battle up with Ranma and<br/>Rache, not to mention the prior battle with the senshi, had exhausted<br/>the boy.<p>Schuldich smirked, "Only Ranma, bishounen. Rache is eighteen," his eyes<br/>twinkled, and he turned to leave, "I'm going to find Kenken. Any idea<br/>where he is, Brad?"<p>"In his room," the american's gaze narrowed, "Don't call me _Brad_!"<p>-<p>Yohji's eyes were glued open as he watched Rache stalk past. If _this_<br/>was what she had to wear for this missin... he almost whined like a dog<br/>at his misfortune. Rache was _hot_!<p>"Take your eyes off her rear, Kudou," Ranma, in a matching outfit, only<br/>in different colors and thigh-high bitch boots, had stepped up beside<br/>him, They were far from the best of friends, and often got into fist<br/>fights, but they were at least speaking semi-civilly to each other,<br/>"She's almost as pissed off as _I_ am, having to wear these god awful<br/>uniforms."<p>"_Those_ are uniforms, Saotome?" the playboy hiked an eyebrow,<br/>deliberately raking his gaze over her form, "What are you, a french<br/>maid who dyed her uniform neon?"<p>"Yohji," Ranma sing-songed sweetly, "would you _like_ to see how bad it<br/>hurts to have one of these heels ground into your dick?"<p>"Ah," the Weiss boy backed off a bit, horrified by the squeak in his<br/>voice, "Ah, that's alright, Ranma. No thanks."<p>"To bad!" Ranma procliamed cheerfully, snagging Yohji by his collar and<br/>dragging him towards Rache's room. When they got there, Ranma kocked,<br/>waited for permission, then entered.<p>Rache's senshi uniform was on the floor, and she was in a pair of<br/>boxers and an oversized t-shirt, "Ranma? Yohji?"<p>"Hi Naru," Yohji got a out a bit weakly, still trying to remove Ranma's<br/>grip on his shirt. Ranma grinned, and sent the long haired man tumbling<br/>to the ground.<p>"Yo, Rache, Kudou here's offered to be part of our enemies forces."<p>"Really?"<p>"I _what_?"<p>Ranma grinned nastily, "Think of it," she told the man, "as a bit of<br/>payback for that french maid comment."<p>"So... what exactly does an enemy do?" Yohji sulked, although there<br/>were _two_ good points about this arrangement. First, Ranma was<br/>unlikely to pound on him for the rest of the night, and second... he<br/>got to see Rache in that uniform! She was soooo hot... his eyes glazed<br/>over as he went into fantasy mode.<p>Ranma and Rache both rolled their eyes, having gotten used to Yohji's<br/>odd behaviour. Ranma turned to her fellow psuedo-senshi, "When he wakes<br/>up, explain it. I'm going to get changed."<p>The redhead strolled out of the room, tugging off her evening gloves<br/>and scarf as she went, glad to finally be taking the crap off. She<br/>pushed open her own door, ignoring the presence of both Farfello and<br/>Aya- who ignored her, as well, seeing how involved in cutting each<br/>other to ribbons as they were.<p>Dropping onto her bed, the first things she yanked off were those damn<br/>boots, letting them clatter to the floor. Still, the boys ignored her-<br/>but it wasn't like Ranma had any feminine modesty despite what Nodoka<br/>had tried to teach her- and stripped the godawful yellow and pink<br/>fuku, leaving her naked but for the panties and bra Rache insisted she<br/>wore for the mission.<p>The clothes she'd been wearing earlier in the day were still scattered<br/>over her unmade bed. It only took a few more minutes to remove the<br/>girls underwear, put on his boxers, dump hot water over his head, and<br/>pull the muscle shirt he favored on.<p>"Have you finished changing, yet?" Okay, so apparently Aya _had_<br/>noticed, and averted his eyes.<p>Ranma snorted, "Yeah."<p>"Kitty come play?" Farfello questioned with a pout, and the dark haired<br/>boy glided over, patting Farf on the arm.<p>"Not right now, Jei-sama, but I have an idea that will be lots of fun<br/>for you and Ayan."<p>"Will it hurt God?"<p>At Ranma's gleeful nod, Aya mumbled, "Psychopaths. Why are<br/>_psychopaths_ my best friends?" Both forsaid psychopaths ignopred his<br/>words. They usually did when he got to questioning his sanity or choice<br/>fo friends.<p>"You two get to be the villians in out little senshi-killing game," he<br/>smiled widely.<p>"I thought Crawford didn't want us there to distract you," Aya hiked an<br/>eyebrow, and Ranma snickered.<p>"What he doesn't know, can't hurt him."<p>"He can see the future, Ranma."<p>Ranma shrugged, "Whatever. You two and Kudou are the visible enemies.<br/>Nagi is the inivsible on. Controller of all evil and some shit like<br/>that."<p>"And Yohji agreed to this?" Aya was sceptical. Yohji _never_ ran head<br/>long into _anything_ Ranma suggested. He shrugged again.<p>"He zoned on Rache and me, so I came to tell you two. This is going to<br/>be _so_ much fun!"<p>"I'll bet," Aya grumbled, but tagged along as Ranma led them back to<br/>Rache's room. The trio of males entered in time to see Yohji scowl.<p>"I have to wear a _uniform_?" He hadn't had to wear a uniform since<br/>his school days- being a private investigator meant he didn't have to<br/>have a uniform.<p>The redheaded girl nodded, "Whatever uniform Nagi wants you to wear,<br/>you wear. Trust me, I've been used as Sailorsenshi bait enough times to<br/>know how this works. Our biggest problem is getting Youma and bad guys<br/>for the sneshi to fight."<p>"Nah," Ranma dropped onto her bed, Aya staying near the door, and<br/>Farfello standing beside his pet, "We get Omi to have his girlfriend<br/>raid Happosei's room in the Tendou Dojo. Oh, yeah, Ayan and Jei-sama<br/>agreed to be villians."<p>"We did?" Fujimiya mumbled to himself, and was ignored. Jei grinned his<br/>favorite psychotically happy grin. He just wished he had a knife to<br/>lick to improve on the image.<p>"SO what's in the Tendou Dojo that could help us?"<p>"The leech has a bunch of scrolls to summon evil spirits," Ranma purred<br/>deep in his throat as Jei began to run his fingers through the younger<br/>boy's hair, "Whoever summon one, controls it. Then it's easy for us to<br/>smash it up."<p>"One problem," Yohji drawlled, "in case you forgot, Naru doesn't _have_<br/>offensive abilities, only healing."<p>"That's what bruder is for," Rache smiled happily at Yohji, oblivious<br/>to the fact that his brain had shorted out from the hundred watt smile,<br/>and he was no longer listening, "he can make them think they say my<br/>scimitar glowing, so it's like the outer senshi's weapons."<p>"So," Aya was frowning, "We have to wear uniforms designed by Nahi,<br/>summon demons to fight you, possibly fight you ourselves, and<br/>ultimately get killed, one by one?"<p>"Yeap," Rache and Ranma choursed. Jei cheered happily, while Yohji<br/>zoned and Aya groaned.<p>-<p>"Who do you think those two new senshi last night were?" for once, it<br/>was Usagi who got the ball rolling, "They wore out uniform, so they<br/>must be from our system, right? They'll be on our side?"<p>"I don't trust them," Rei proclaimed, scowling mightily, "Something<br/>is... is _wrong_ with that one in yellow's aura."<p>"Apollo," Ami corrected absently, not bothering to look up from her<br/>textbook, "and the other was Charon."<p>"Isn't Charon Pluto's moon?" Makoto wondered, tapping her chin with one<br/>long, slender finger. This time, Ami looked up.<p>"He was also the man who ferried the spirits of the dead into the<br/>underworld, Pluto's domain. By the color of her fuku, I would assume<br/>that Salorcharon's world could not sustain life, long before the ned of<br/>the Silver Millennium."<p>"So," Usagi smiled, "you're saying Charon and APollo are friends? Did<br/>you find info on them in your comptuer, or something?"<p>"There is no data in the Mercury computer on either a 'Sailorcharon' or<br/>a 'Sailorapollo'."<p>"But they may be our only hope," Setsuna's voice floated to them, and<br/>the girls looked up. A split second later they were supporting the<br/>ragid-looking fashion designer, and helping her sit. She looked so<br/>ill... "I could never see past a certain point in the timeline. I<br/>always assumed that _that_ was when Crystal Tokyo would be formed... I<br/>can see past it now."<p>"What did you see?" Rei worried her lip, her own visions over the past<br/>few weeks had been horrible.<p>"War, Destruction, Mayhem... but that is without Apollo and Charon's<br/>help. With them, Crystal Tokyo _is_ possible[1]," Setsuna sighed<br/>heavily, "it seems that Chaos was not the last enemy."<p>-<p>Xue Shi sneezed, rubbing her nose irritably.<p>"Bless you," Oz mumbled automatically, as the young man stared out into<br/>the night club. As always, a spot of white hair surrounded by red and a<br/>splash of brown caught his attention, and he found himself staring into<br/>a single, possessive amber eye. Oz felt his wofl stir angrily, annoyed<br/>that another alpha had moved into his territory.<p>The teen shoved the feeling away, knowing full well all Jei cared about<br/>was the young woman who's band he was a part of.<p>"Thanks Oz," the redhead combed her hair with her fingers, "Someone<br/>must be talking about me... Anyways, we've got a gig to play. Let's<br/>go!"<p>End Chapter<p>[1] Just not probable. At least, not since "Charon" and "Apollo" have<br/>been assigned to kill the senshi.
