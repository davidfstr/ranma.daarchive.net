</div>*grins, blushing, and scratching the back of her head* Seamlessly?<br/>I've crossed them over seamlessly? Oh wow, all that practise with LoD<br/>and AM and all my other weird little uncontinued crossovers must have<br/>really helped... but that's such a wonderful comment, Jade Hunter!<br/>Thank you ever so much!<p>WyldeHorse, Adyen - I do write faster. I actually haven't worked on<br/>True Identity AT ALL for the last month or so. I hit a bit of a<br/>stumbling block (read: My father yelled at me to "do something else<br/>for a change"), and ended up spending a few weeks out of the house.<p>And of course, there's the fact that I've been stalking Arylon<br/>*stalkstalkstalk* on the BnG forums.<p>True Identity<br/>Chapter Four: Villains<br/>Li Xiang<p>Xue Shi stared across the room at her opponent, wondering if _this_<br/>would be the battle she lost... no! Saotome Ranma never loses, and Xue<br/>Shi was Ranma. She. Would. Win.<p>Even if she had to beg to do it.<p>"C'mon Oz, you can't tell me you'd rather live here than in your own<br/>room- you're amerikajin! You guys _like_ everything big and huge, and<br/>with lots of room. Fei and Nobuyuki already said they'd come if you<br/>did."<p>Considering she'd been at this for over an hour, it was no surprise<br/>that Oz finally caved in, "Alright, alright! We'll move in with you<br/>and your friends!"<p>This is a bad idea, he thought to himself, My wolf does _not_ like<br/>Farfello...<p>-<p>"I wonder who Apollo and Charon really are," Minako mumbled to<br/>Artemisu as she strolled towards the Crown arcade. The white cat was<br/>sprawlled across her shoulders.<p>Artemisu shrugged, "I'm not sure. Normally when a new senshi shows up,<br/>there's someone new in the area- but we haven't seen anyone new in a<br/>long while. Especially not two redheads.<p>Minako nodded in agreement before entering the arcade.<p>-<p>Osaka Naru looked up as the tired form of Tsukino Usagi settled in<br/>front of her, "I'm sorry I didn't call last night, Naru-chan. I'll<br/>call tonight, I promise!"<p>Naru smiled, "Really? That's great! ... Uhm, Usagi-chan I've been<br/>wondering why you-"<p>"Usagi-chan!" the madly waving form of Kino Makoto had Usagi bouncing<br/>to her feet, all previous tiredness fading away. Without even waving<br/>goodbye, Usagi had run off to Makoto's side with a gleeful shriek of<br/>"Mako-chan!"<p>Naru watched them for a few minutes, then looked down at her food.<br/>Suddenly not feeling all that hungry, she snapped her obento closed<br/>and went off in search of her boyfriend.<p>He was probably in the computer room again, making viruses. Guiro<br/>Umino was strangely skilled at that, the redhead mused as she padded<br/>back into the school. He also had a tendency to forget to eat as he<br/>worked.<p>She smiled, but it was tinged with sadness. Why had her best friend<br/>left her without even a wave of goodbye?<p>-<p>Aya and Yohji _stared_. They stared long and hard, but it was stills<br/>taring. Yohji was the first to speak, "_These_ are our Uniforms?"<p>"You don't like them?" Nagi had raised an eyebrow in question. Near by<br/>Racyhe, Ranma and Schuldich snickered. Farfello was picking at the<br/>uniform he already wore.<p>"Nagi," Aya ground out, "What the _hll_ gave you the idea that _these_<br/>were uniforms?"<p>The boy shrugged, "I saw some new images of what the senshi's enemies<br/>have worn int he past., With a little help from Rache and her artisti<br/>talents- not to mention Ranma's money- I got these made."<p>"But I look like a harem-boy!" Yohji whined, lifting the tight leather<br/>pants, the black leather dog collar, and the leather vest he'd be<br/>wearing. More buckles and straps fell off the vcest, tumbling to the<br/>floor.<p>Rache blinked innocently, "_I_ think you would look nice..."<p>That shut Kudou up. The next insant, he was off in bliss-land again,<br/>daydreaming. Oh, yeah Ranma snickered, Kudou has it _bad_. Aya on the<br/>other hand...<p>He pulled the red silk pants up, staring at them. Nothing wrong with<br/>them- he'd wear those- it was the leather straps meant to be wrapped<br/>around the legs. Instead of a vest, or going barechested, Aya had a<br/>matching blood red sleeveless turtleneck. Red bracers would go voer<br/>black gloves. And there were lots and lots of straps.<p>"No."<p>"Ayan," Ranma trilled, ignoring the death glare he got in return, "Why<br/>not?"<p>"Because," the irate redhead growled. Ranma sighed.<p>"Because why?"<p>The redhead glared further, and Ranma snorted, "Jei-sama likes his."<p>"That's because he's insane," Aya grumbled, glancing over at the<br/>one-eyed assassin. He had a pair of bleached white jeans on, a white<br/>t-shirt that was little more than strings attached to seams, and<br/>showed off just as many scars as his usual jacket-vest did. With the<br/>exception of his collar, every single black strap that bound his arms<br/>or legs had a knife tucked beneath them.<p>"If I let you wear your trenchcoat," Nagi's voice brought him back<br/>from his observations- a sick feeling spinning in his stomach, he<br/>promised himself to look at that feeluing in more detail later- and<br/>he turned his attention on the youngest member of the two groups,<br/>"Will you wear your uniform?"<p>"Sure," he could always just clo-<p>"Of course," Ranma cut in before he could finish his thought, "You<br/>can't close the jacket over your uniform."<p>"I never agreed to that!" Aya snapped, and Ranma stuck his tongue out.<p>"Don't you have something you're supposed to be doing, Bishoujo?"<p>Ranma _glared_ at the telepath for reminding him. Grumbling, the young<br/>man stalked out of the room, headed for his own. He _Really_ hated<br/>this mission. Stupid fuku.<p>-<p>"You want me to _what_?" Nabiki jerked out of her beau's loose<br/>embrace, spinning around on her bed to face the seventeen year old,<br/>"Have you forgotten that _he's_ the reason behind my little sister's<br/>coma?"<p>Omi sighed, crossing his arms over his chest, "I know, but this is<br/>_really_ important."<p>"Important _how_?" the brunnette glowered at Tsukiyono, "You're asking<br/>me to help Ranma kill someone!"<p>"Important that _Yohji_ begged me to ask you."<p>"Balinese?" At this the middle Tendou got confused, "Yohji and Saotome<br/>rarely- if _ever_- agree!"<p>"I know," Omi reached forwards to draw her into his arms again. They<br/>were still getting used to being a couple- they'd been best friends<br/>forever, and liked each other alot- it was only logical that they<br/>took it to the next step. Nabiki curled up in his lap, resting her<br/>head against his shoulder. Omi continued after a few moments of<br/>silence, "This is Naru's first mission. Yohji likes her alot- so much<br/>that he's cut back on his flitter almost by half!- and he doesn't<br/>want her to get hurt. I think this is more so for her, than for<br/>Ranma."<p>Nabiki nodded, wrapping her arms around his middle, beneath his<br/>jacket. For a some reason, she felt so cold... "I understand that. If<br/>I get those scrolls for you, Omittchi, I want something in return."<p>"I should have known," he mumbled, resting a cheek upon the top of her<br/>head, "How much do you want?"<p>"Not momney," she sounded vaguely amused, and _very_ determined, "What<br/>I want is power."<p>"Power?"<p>Nabiki's smile was shark-like in it's visciousness, "Enough to be more<br/>than a minor nuisence to Ranma. I want the power to physically<br/>_destroy_ him."<p>-<p>Apollo and Charon were in position, ready to bound in and save the day<br/>the moment Schuldich gave the signal. _That_ didn't matter. What<br/>mattered was that it was fall, and Yohji was frickin' freezing!<p>The black leather vest may have made him look hot, but the fact that<br/>he was all but bare chested, was all that was on his mind as he<br/>crossed his arms over his chest and chaffed them in an attempt to warm<br/>up. In the back of his mind, he was cussing out a certain telekinetic,<br/>but int he forefront he was wondering why Japan had to get so damned<br/>cold. And why did Aya get to wear a jacket?<p>/Because Nagi had Rache design your outfit./ Was the german man's<br/>distracted response. Yohji blinked- Schuldich had been distracted? By<br/>what? The only time he... oh, Yohji smirked to himself. He'd gotten<br/>used to Schuldich's never ending quest of getting Ken into the sack.<br/>Apparently, even being on a mission didn't stop those attempts. There<br/>was even a bet at the House for how long it would take Ken to break<br/>down and give in.<p>"So how much longer are we going to end up waiting for Omi and those<br/>scrolls to show up?" Yohji scowled at Aya and Jei, who stood not all<br/>that far away, apparently neither feeling the fall night's chill. Aya<br/>cast his team mate an irritated glance.<p>"Omi's a block and a half to the east," he grunted, "He'll be here in<br/>a few minutes."<p>As he'd predicted, it only took Tsukiyono six minutes to reach the<br/>parking lot of the building they stood upon. A quick mental relay<br/>between him, Nagi, and Schuldich had the telekinetic levitating the<br/>scrolls to the rooftop, and Omi leaving the area. It would do no good<br/>to be in the area when the Sailorsenshi inevitably arrived to "save<br/>the day".<p>There was something else Rache had noticed while acting as bait for<br/>target for the various "bad guys"- they didn't use real demons. They<br/>used demon-human or demon-item breeds. The Sailorsenshi had never<br/>fought a hell-beast before. They would be woefully unprepared. Ranma-<br/>excuse me, Apollo- had killed a god. A hell-beast, evil spirit, or a<br/>demon would be very easy to beat in comparison. The scrolls were<br/>designed to bring such creatures into this plane of existence.<p>The Sailorsenshi wouldn't know what hit them, but Ranma and Rache<br/>would be able to swoop in and save the day. Now they just had to<br/>decide who was going to be the first "henchman" to attack.<p>It fell to the age-old classic way of deciding. Jan ken pon.<p>Yohji would be going first. After randomly slecting one of the ancient<br/>scroolls- apparently made of papyrus of all things- the black<br/>leather clad white hunter called upon his own leassons in the art of<br/>properly roof-hopping. After having refused lessons from Schuldich and<br/>Ranma, he'd convinced Aya to teach him.<p>In any case, the long haired playboy jumped a couple of roofs over and<br/>opened the scroll. After a few minutes, 2with the heiroglyphs on the<br/>scroll still not making any sense, he looked around for something to<br/>help. His eyes lit upon the sheet of paper that had fallen out when he<br/>opened the scroll.<p>"The translation![1]" he grinned, reading the sheet. This would make<br/>summoning a demon much easier. His stomach began to do flip-flops as<br/>he read the translated words...<p>-<p>"There! It's over there!" Mercury pointed one slender finger towards<br/>the massive amounts of property damage created by their current enemy.<br/>Only the Sailorsenshi would have needed someone to point out the<br/>blantantly opbvious.<p>When they got there, they did not get what they expected. They had<br/>expected what they always got- a vaguely human female form, made out<br/>of something or other.<p>What they got was a thin and sickly looking creature, it's ribs<br/>showing on it's chest, and skin sagging over muscle and bone. It was a<br/>brownish beige color, with a beast-like head that extended back with a<br/>long crest. Winds of pitch and its skin-tone curved around its body. A<br/>segmented tail helped to balance it.<p>And standing behind it, was a smug looking black leather wearing man.<p>"That must be the one controlling this youma!" Mercury declared,<br/>staring into her computer screen, hoping to be given knowledge on who<br/>this man- or his beast- was. There was nothing on the man, and<br/>whenever she tried for the beast, the information was encrypted with<br/>the codes of that only the Royal Family of the Moon had known how to<br/>beat.<p>"But he's so hot!" whined Venus, Jupiter jumping in with her usual,<br/>"He looks like my old Sempai!" They continued staring at him in<br/>adoration until he uncrossed his arms.<p>Pointing at them, the strange man commanded, "Midnight Fiend![2]<br/>Destroy those girls!"<p>The beast turned from destroying massive amounts of property to<br/>attacking the girls. They shriejked at the first attack- not even<br/>hhaving the chance to shout their speeches- before retaliating.<p>-<p>/I can't exactly jsut give them my _real_ name!/ Yohji growled to<br/>Schuldich over the tight ban.<p>/Yeah, calling Playboy "Kudou" might actually give those girls a<br/>clue!/<p>A snort from Rache, /They can't even get a clue when it's standing<br/>under their noses./<p>Schuldich was more or less wondering if using his telepathy to connect<br/>them all together like this was a good idea. He was getting the mother<br/>of all migraines.<p>/We do need to use names other than our own, or our codenames,/ Aya<br/>mused.<p>/Especially since you used to be two different groups,/ Both<br/>psudeo-senshi came out with at the same time. Both girls blinked, and<br/>Schuldich laughed at the stero words. It was Nagi who came up witht he<br/>solution.<p>/We should choose the names of gods from another religion, the<br/>Sailorsenshi are named for gods, afterall./<p>There was a round of agreement- except from Jei, who objected until<br/>Ranma pointed out that it was a form of blasphemy- and it was Rache<br/>who brought up the all important question, /But which religion?/<p>/The scrolls looked pretty old,/ Aya tapped his chin in thought, /What<br/>language were they in, Yohji?/<p>/Egyptian,/ the playboy was starting to sound nervous, /The<br/>Sailorsenshi may be having some trouble- but more have shown up!<br/>Could we hurry this up, _please_?/<p>/We hear ya, Playboy,/ Ranma grumped at the sametime Nahi declared<br/>their names.<p>/Egyptian gods, then. Yohji you are Horus. Aya, you're Osiris.<br/>Farfie'll be Ptah. And I'll be Amun-Ra./<p>/We'll get an explaination later,/ Schuldich barked, / Ranma! Rache!<br/>Go!/<p>/Right!/ and the two teens shot off. Unliek the night a few days<br/>previous, they didn't come out of a tree. Instead, Ranma dropped down<br/>from a roofttop as Rache tore in from an alley across fromt eh battle<br/>zone. Apollo set herself up to take the battle to the Fiend, while<br/>Charon stood in a defensive position between the injured and the down<br/>senshi. Apollo made short work of the hell-beast, utliziing the fairly<br/>deep ki resevers she had "gained" after dueling with Saffron, to five<br/>off varying strength ki-blasts.<p>Once again, Mercury pointed out the very obvious, by pointing at<br/>Yohji- that is to say, at Horus, "He was the one controlling it!"<p>Charon's emerald and Apool's blue steel gaze turned to Yohji. APollo<br/>didn't have to act- she and Yohji were definately not the best of<br/>friends- and the blue-eyed redhead growled, "Horus. Should'a known<br/>you'd show up, ya bastard."<p>"And I should have realised _you_ were still an immature bitch," he<br/>shot back, his gaze more-or-less steady on Charon's- not Apollo's-<br/>form. He wasn't really consciously hearing the insults, and was only<br/>subconsciously responding.<p>Charon's shiver of delight upon seeing the leather-clad man was easily<br/>mistaken for disgust by the senshi who could only see her back. She<br/>barely dragged her mask into place, drawing her scimitar and aiming it<br/>at her wanna-be neau, Horus.<p>"Think I can fire one off before he moves, 'Pollo?" Apollo let a blue<br/>glow flare around her hands.<p>"Doubtful, he's a fast asshole."<p>"And you'll be dead in a moment," Yohji was going to enjoy this as<br/>much as he possibly could. Nagi was going to boost all his actions and<br/>reactions so he could actually keep up with Ranma for once. This would<br/>be _so_ much _fun_!<p>Apollo smirked in response, and the two of them lundged at each toher.<br/>Just as they always did while "sparring"- in reality, Ranma beating<br/>the crap out fo Yohji- Apollo led off, but this time, Horus could<br/>retaliate. And retaliate he did. They duked it out, punch for punch,<br/>Horus wincing every-so-often, and Apollo grinning widely.<p>As Apollo ducked under a cresent kick, whirling to sweep Horus' feet<br/>out from beneath him, Charon noticed movement out of the corner of her<br/>eye. With Ranma-borne relfexes, Charon grabbed the Moon Tier, and<br/>stared hard into Eternal Sailormoon's eyes, "Don't interupt them.<br/>Apollo and Horus' enimity goes way back- to before she learned who<br/>she was. To interupt one of their battles is to invite _both_ their<br/>wrath down on you," to prove her point, Rache rubbed her hip, "I've<br/>learned from experience."<p>"There must be one hell of a story behind this," Mars growled.<p>Charon's lips curled, but she calmed herself, "There is. You're likely<br/>to hear it later if you keep messing it up with Horus, and the rest of<br/>his buddies. Now shut up and watch the fight."<p>Apollo had planted her feet into Horus' back, having leapt over him<br/>when he attempted to tackle her. He recovered by throwing his arms<br/>forwards and shooting through a flip- attempting to ram his feet into<br/>her chest. He missed, and she swept in with a sharp one-two combo<br/>followed by a roundhouse kick. He had ducked out of the punches'<br/>reach, but the kick caught him squarely in the ribs.<p>He took a tumble, rolling out of the way bare seconds before Apollo's<br/>fist ripped throught he ground where his head had been.<p>/What are you trying to do- kill me?/ he swept a kick away from<br/>himself, stepping into her guard for a rabbit punch to her throat- it<br/>missed, Ranma having bent at an impossible angle away from him.<p>/I didn't hit you, did I?/ the redhead barked back, /I slowed down<br/>enough so you could dodge!/ she finished bending over by turning it<br/>into a flup, catching him sharply in the jaw with both heels.<p>Horus went flying backwards, and would have attempt to reorientate<br/>himself to rebound off the tree he was headed for- had he not been<br/>intercepted.<p>Aya stood, in all his red silk and black leather trenchcoated-<br/>complete with katana- glory. He set Horus down on his feet with a<br/>smirk, "I see you are as skilled as ever, Apollo."<p>"...Osiris," Apollo's slight hesitate, mistake for distaste, was<br/>really just her asking Schuldich what Aya's name was again, "How...<br/>nice to see you again."<p>The two redheads spent a few minutes in a staring contest, breaking<br/>only when Charon spoke.<p>"Blade-to-blade, you and me, Osiris!"<p>Violet eyes stared her down, "You aren't ready to duel me, yet,<br/>Charon. Perhaps another time."<p>"C'mon Osiris- let's double team them!" Yohji was really getting into<br/>this. It was almost like he was in highs chool agian, locke dup in one<br/>classroom or another, playing their role play games. He had really<br/>missed those games once had had started in with Weiss.<p>Osiris' cool gaze switched to him, "Amun-Ra would like to have a word<br/>with you about recklessness, Horus."<p>"Well, you know Horus," Apollo was walking closer, cracking her<br/>knuckles, "The little Playboy just can't resist my charms."<p>Osiris smirked at the smaller fo the two remale redheads, "Ptah sends<br/>his greetings _Bastet_." She froze, as though someone had turned her<br/>swtich to 'off'. Osiris and Horus merely seemed to fade out of<br/>existence, leaving the senshi alone, with a lot of questions.<p>And according to the plan, neither Apollo or Charon could leave. They<br/>would have to answer any and all questions, if they were to gain the<br/>trust of the Sailorsenshi.<p>-<br/>End Chapter<p>Aren't I evil? *waggles a finger* Now, no sicking Asuza on me,<br/>Matthew (which number were you again? *grins*), or no more True<br/>Identity for you!<p>There were times that as I typed this, Mai's voice popped into my<br/>head, either laughing, or saying the lines. Don't know who Mai is?<br/>Don't worry about it.<p>Now, I'm off to the Royal Tyrell Musuem for a day trip. Spend a couple<br/>hours in a car there and back, but it's gunna be fun. I haven't been<br/>there in years.<p>[1] Oh c'mon, you don't think Happi would have left the scroll<br/>untranslated? He translated it for his own useage!<p>[2] Yes, it's _that_ Midnight Fiend. If you don't know what I'm<br/>talking about, ignore it.
