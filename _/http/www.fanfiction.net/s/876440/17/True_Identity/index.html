</div>*yawns* Okay, note to self, next time B calls after midnight, hang up<br/>on him. *rubs her eyes* My oh-so-nice friend decided to call me the<br/>moment he finished watching his dvd box set of G-Gundam. And then we<br/>talked for two hours about it.<p>Considering I've never seen G-Gundam, I don't know how we managed to<br/>talk about it for two hours without him giving any spoilers. This is B!<br/>He _always_ lets something slip- and yet he didn't. And now I want to<br/>see G-Gundam, jsut to see if it's as great as he proclaims it, but Kris<br/>has the first disc, so I'll have to wait. Joys.<p>I have been writting fanatically lately; I know exactly where I'm going<br/>with True Identity, so I wanted to get it out of my head. I've already<br/>sent chatpers 17 and 18 off to my prereader, but Mei's a bit busy, so<br/>it might be a bit before they come back.<p>True Identity<br/>Chapter Sixteen - Dreaming<br/>Li Xiang<p>Rache flew into the House, half panicked. After Horus had left, Moon<br/>had crumpled to the ground in tears, barely being held up by Mars and<br/>Venus, while Neptune and Uranus played guard. And Rache had turned tail<br/>and run, eventually finding herself hiding in the shadows of the Koneko<br/>no Sumi Ie. There she curled up, shuddering and sobbing at her once<br/>friend's actions. Why had Usagi done that?<p>Rache was positive that Usagi was only crying because she hadn't been<br/>able to finish whatever the hell she had been doing to Bastet. After<br/>she'd managed to calm down, she'd gone immediately to the House.<p>This brings us back to the flurry of redhair and grey seifuku that<br/>dashed into the House, worrying over what had happened to her friend.<br/>Her eyes searched out her housemates, and spotted Yohji sprawled in the<br/>main living room of the House, "Yohji!"<p>"Rache...?" the man looked up from his reading, just in time to be hit<br/>with a crying redhead, "Shh... shh... it's alright..."<p>"...Ranma...?" she managed to ask between her sobs. A light hand landed<br/>on her shoulder.<p>"I'm fine," came the oh-so-familiar voice of Ranma's male form, "A<br/>little shaken, and a little confused, but I'm fine."<p>Rache turned tear filled green eyes to her friend, and sniffled.<p>Loudly, she managed to say, "You're ok!"<p>He cracked a grin, "I am. So... no more cryin', okay?"<p>She gave a hesitant nod, before burrowing herself into Yohji's embrace.<br/>Ranma gave the older man a distinct look- 'hurt her, I kill you'-<br/>that Yohji nodded his acceptance of. No hesitation, just full<br/>agreement. The martial artist smirked, and then glided away.<p>With footsteps so soft that they were unheard, and fluid movements that<br/>didn't even rustle his clothing, the gender-bending martial artist<br/>slipped up behind the newest additions to their home. The four members<br/>of the Shitennou were watching the battle that had just happened on<br/>some of the House's monitors.<p>"Looks painful," Zoicite muttered, watching Bastet 'get fried'.<p>"It is," Ranma look extreme glee from the fact that all four jumped in<br/>surprise, "So, have you four chosen your sides?"<p>The men looked between themselves, apparently reaching some decision.<br/>Zoicite, Nephrite and Jadaeite stepped away from kunzite. The brunnette<br/>motioned to the trio, "We're going neutral, Saotome."<p>"How 'bout you, Ei'lorosha?"<p>Kunzite crossed his arms, "I'm offering my services to Crawford."<p>"Braddy-kins has a use for you?" the martial artist wondered with an<br/>amused look. Of course Crawford would have 'a use' for Kunzite. The<br/>future-seer _never_ did anything without a reason. The Shitennou would<br/>have remained spirits locked in stone if he didn't have a reason.<p>Kunzite nodded, "I've already spoken with him."<p>"So whatcha gunna be doing?"<p>"That," Kunzite smirked, "is a secret!"<p>-<p>Aya-chan had a bit of trouble walking- months in a coma would do<br/>that- but she'd recovered remarkably quickly. Then again, with Yuki's<br/>"special" way for helping, anyone would.<p>So the pair- one sixteen, one nineteen- was drifting down the road in<br/>the direction of a certain pet shop. Yuki could not care less that she<br/>was wanted by Kritiker; they would never attack her in broad daylight,<br/>on a busy street. And seeing as they were trying to find Fujimiya Ran,<br/>Aya-chan's hobbling stride down the road would only bring his attention<br/>faster, right?<p>Ran would be ecstatic to find Aya up and about, now wouldn't he?<p>At least, that was what Yuki's logic was thinking.<p>Eventually, they came to the entrance of the pet shop. The bells over<br/>the door jangled as they entered, and Yuki carelessly caroled, "Jiisan!<br/>Jiisan, I'm home~!"<p>"You live here?" wondered Aya, but Yuki shook her head negative.<p>"Nope. Jiisan! Oi Kojiro, where are you hiiiiiiiding~?"<p>"I'm right here, Yuki," the man stated, making her jump in surprise,<p>"What are you doing back?"<p>"We're looking for Aya-chan's 'niisan," Yuki grinned, already over her<br/>shock. Kojiro eyed her suspiciously.<p>"And your brother, as well, no doubt."<p>"Well, _that_ one is obvious!" Yuki flashed a grin. Kojiro shook his<br/>head, exasperated.<p>"Go to No-chan, Yuki, I'm sure she knows."<p>"She's here?" if anything, Yuki had began to bounce in place, she was<br/>so excited, "Yay! Aya-chan, you can meet my mom!"<p>-<p>Naru grit her teeth angrily.<p>The redhead was seated at a table, picking at her bento. Emerald eyes<br/>were fixated on a specific blonde, that she could feel a slow, creeping<br/>hate build within her for. It had been two years now. Two years since<br/>she and Usagi had been so close.<p>She felt so distant now. Usagi never called any more, her own few calls<br/>had not been returned and the blonde rarely came by the Osa-P. When<br/>Naru saw her friend at the arcade, she was always surrounded by her<br/>little clique of girls. Naru would begin to approach, and then they'd<br/>all get up and leave.<p>It hurt to be excluded like that. She'd known they'd begun to drift way<br/>back when Mizuno Ami had first come to Juuban Middle School.<p>Following that, Usagi had seemingly befriended every new student. And<br/>once someone had found themselves friends with the energetic blonde,<br/>they didn't want to be friends with anyone else. Naru could remember<br/>that feeling well.<p>Naru could also remember the jealousy that would spring up whenever<br/>someone else "basked" in Usagi's favor. You were at the top of the<br/>world when you were Usagi's best friend.<p>When you were the least of her friends, you did everything to regain<br/>her attention, her favor. Naru remembered her own desperation to get<br/>back to being Usagi's best friend, as it had only been a few months<br/>since she had been like that.<p>Bitterly, she recalled the lengths Usagi went to ignore her. She felt<br/>like a toy, used and abused. Had Usagi planned it this way? The redhead<br/>honestly didn't know either way. As it was, she glowered sulkily,<br/>countenance driving off all who could possibly want to offer the<br/>sixteen year old friendship, as it was, Usagi took the attention of<br/>every new member of the school- and that included the new transfer<br/>students.<p>The Three Lights.<p>Taiki Kou, Seiya Kou, and Yaten Kou[1]<p>She narrowed jade eyes upon the trio that bore the same name, as they<br/>joined Usagi's clique to eat lunch. Abruptly, she stood, snapping her<br/>obento shut. With long strides, she returned to the school building,<br/>headed for the computer labs. She had work to do.<p>As she stalked through the halls, she muttered obscenities in German.<br/>It was her first language, after all, and she never forgot it. She did<br/>not want to- she didn't want to lose her only connection of her<br/>beloved elder brother.<p>So involved was she in bitter thoughts, that she stalked right past one<br/>white haired, lavender-eyed 'reporter', dressed like a 1950s American<br/>Mafia member, without batting an eye. Koshin had told her that he could<br/>be found in the lab.<p>She was about to take up the fifteen year old's offer to train her in<br/>the art of the blade.<p>-<p>Tomoe Hotaru jerked awake, violet eyes wide and unseeing. For several<br/>long moments, the disguised senshi lay in her bed, taking in deep,<br/>shuddering breaths. What... what had just happened?<p>She'd been dreaming, she knew, but she hadn't dreamt that she was<br/>herself. In fact, she'd been dreaming that she'd been... Naru? It had<br/>been happened for a few weeks now, too. It was so confusing!<p>Carefully, the girl wriggled out of her comforter, padding softly<br/>across the floor. She had to talk to the redhead- these dreams she<br/>had... were they Naru's memories? She picked up her communicator,<br/>clicking it on and focusing on Charon. The magic of the Silver<br/>Millennium was truly impressive. Just by thinking of a person,<br/>communication could be achieved.<p>She was startled by a male voice muttered, "Rache? Rache, your<br/>communication thingy is glowing." It was vaguely familiar...<p>The Naru appeared on screen, eyes puffy and red from crying,<p>"...Hotaru?"<p>"Naru...? Could I talk to you?" the dark haired girl quickly threw in,<p>"...in person?" when the redhead looked about to speak. After a moment<br/>the older female gave a hesitant nod.<p>"Sure, when do you want to meet?"<p>Hotaru had no choice, so she replied, "Now." she had to get this done<br/>right _now_, else she'd never remember to. If she went back to sleep,<br/>she'd lose this feeling, this _need_. She had to know, had to<br/>understand if this was just a dream, or if it was reality.<p>"_Now_?" Naru repeated, incredulously, "Hotaru, it's two am!"<p>"I _know_" Hotaru huffed, "But I have to talk to you. Is there<br/>someplace... private where we can talk?"<p>"I..." Naru started, before her eyes glazed over. After a moment, where<br/>Hotaru was beginning to panic, Naru snapped out of it, nodding to<br/>someone off screen, "I'll come pick you up, Hotaru, since you don't<br/>know where the House is."<p>"The House?"<p>A wry grin was pulled from the redhead, although it was oddly tinged<br/>with sadness, "Oh, yes. The House. It's where I live."<p>"I thought you lived in Mako-chan's apartment block!" Hotaru was<br/>confused. That's where she'd been a few months back, wasn't it?<p>"She kicked me out a long time ago," the other responded, not bothering<br/>to add that she'd played a rather nasty prank to get herself kicked<br/>out, "I've been living with my older brother and his friends."<p>"Oh..."<p>"Look, Hotaru? Get ready; I'll be coming to pick you up in a few<br/>minutes, 'kay?"<p>"Okay," and Hotaru beamed, "I'll be ready. Bye!"<p>Naru cut the communication after saying goodbye, and Hotaru was left<br/>with the task of getting ready.<p>And getting out of her house without Michiru-mama and Haruka-papa<br/>finding out was rather difficult. As she slipped out of her pajamas and<br/>into her clothing from the day before, the fourteen year old looked<br/>over at her window.<p>Her room was on the ground floor.<p>-<p>Rache pulled Crawford's black Mercedes up to the curb in front of the<br/>Outer's home. The older man had no idea that the psuedo-sneshi had<br/>taken his car- he'd been asleep- so Rache was being extra careful in<br/>her driving. She _dearly_ wanted to _keep_ her 'boss' from finding out<br/>that she'd swiped his beloved imported vehicle.<p>Hotaru flitted out of the shadows once Rache had stepped out of the<br/>Mercedes. For a moment, the redhead found herself comparing the young<br/>violet-eyed girl to Aya. They were both surprisingly well adapted to<br/>moving through the night.<p>"Get in, get in."<p>Once they were both into the car- and safely on their way to the<br/>House- Hotaru offered up a shy smile, "Thanks."<p>"For what?" wondered the driver. Despite that it was night, it was<br/>still Tokyo, and that meant traffic.<p>"For picking me up," Hotaru murmured, snuggling down into her arms.<br/>With winter coming, the night was getting colder and colder.<p>It was almost three thirty when Rache pulled off the main road and into<br/>the warehouse district.<p>"What are we doing here?"<p>Rache shot Hotaru an amused look, "My brother has a lot of friends. And<br/>here we are!"<p>Hotaru eyed the depilated structure warily. It looked about to fall<br/>over! But as one of the large truck doors creaked open, and Rache drove<br/>in, the fourteen year old found herself in awe.<p>The broken down outer appearance made sure no one attempted to get into<br/>it. Therefore, safely protecting what was within. Aside from the<br/>Mercedes, there were three bikes- one of which was a low-rider Harley<br/>Davidson of all things!<p>There was a confusing pile of metal in one corner of the garage, but<br/>Hotaru thought she was just seeing things. It looked almost like a<br/>tin-cha before it was animated.<p>"You know," came out voice from the doorway to the rest of the House,<br/>once the two had climbed out of the car, "If you're going to take<br/>Crawford's car out for a spin, you should probably be a bit quieter<br/>when you come back."<p>Hotaru turned to look at their guest, and she just barely held in a<br/>squeal of delight. Just because Xue Shi had gone rouge, didn't mean she<br/>stopped being a good singer. It did not stop her band from being one of<br/>the youngest Senshi's favorites. And it certainly did not stop idol<br/>worship of her band-mates.<p>"You're just over sensitive, Wolf-Boy," Rache half snapped at Oz,<br/>glaring at him meaningfully. Hotaru ignored the exchange of looks as<br/>she descended into full blown hero-worship. She clutched at Rache's<br/>hand suddenly, surprising the redhead.<p>"Is... is that... is that Daniel Ozbourne!"<p>-<p>End Chapter<p>[1] Taiki, Seiya and Yaten are the family names. Kou is actually their<br/>first names. *shrugs* Naoko was being weird, I guess.<p>And next week, we pick up with the talk between Rache and Hotaru. And<br/>things you'd never expect come to light...<p>Hmmm, if anyone wants to host True/False Identity, all you gotta do is<br/>ask. I've been sending it off to people, but I don't know _every_ site<br/>online. Ask away- in reviews or in an email. Doesn't matter to me!
