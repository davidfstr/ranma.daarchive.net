</div><p>[Ranma][Fanfic] Haishin - Chapter 6<br/>By: Aru Sahni<p>Yeah, I know... this is reaaaaaaaaaaaalllly overdue. A lot of stuff has<br/>changed since I first started writing this fic: I'm now in college and<br/>my writing style has definitely changed. Before I sat down to write<br/>this chapter, I had to figure out what I wanted from the fic. After<br/>much thought I realized that the purpose of this fic is to be funny,<br/>have a decent (read: non canon, OOCness) storyline, and be readable.<br/>I hope I succeeded.<p>And now, after much delay, I present to you...<p>==============================================<br/>Haishin - Chapter 6<br/>By: Aru Sahni<p>"Ranma Saotome?" the warrior questioned.<p>"That's me."<p>"I'm here to kill you."<p>"Yeah, yeah, whatever... lets make this quick, okay?" Ranma said while<br/>rolling up his sleeves.<p>"You don't look surprised. Strange, usually one would have soiled<br/>their underpants right about now."<p>"Well, I get this a lot, you're lucky you came right now, because,<br/>judging by my calendar..." Ranma pulls a small notebook out from his<br/>pocket, "the whole week is booked. Damn, Ryoga comes during lunch time-"<p>"Ahem." The warrior cleared his throat.<p>"What? Oh yeah, the fight." Ranma assumes a loose fighting stance in<br/>front of Kasumi. Dark clouds start to gather overhead, blocking the<br/>pale light of the moon. Wanting to end the fight quickly, Ranma charged<br/>the Nordic warrior (A.N. for the sake of ease lets call him Sven.) and,<br/>in a blink of an eye, lets loose a Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken.<br/>Surprisingly, the enemy takes every single blow and doesn't even flinch.<p>"Weak." Sven says and swings his open backhand forward and catches<br/>Ranma in the jaw, causing Ranma to crumple to the ground, unconscious.<p>"Well, that was anticlimactic." Kasumi mumbles.<p>"Oooh, a nice girl who lacks facial hair, I'm gonna have some fun<br/>tonight!" Sven exclaims, rubbing his hands as he advances towards the<br/>paralyzed-with-fear Kasumi.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"No! Its not supposed to happen like this!" Belldandy cries.<p>"Don't worry sis, we'll figure it out."<p>"Did you check his power level?"<p>"Urd, how did you get out?"<p>"That's not important," she says and casts a spell which puts her two<br/>sisters to sleep. "Now the fun begins," she says while cracking her<br/>knuckles. "Power level 5.3E6, that's 5300000... Skuld never did<br/>understand scientific notation. I can't change either combatant's<br/>skills, but I can wake Ranma up..."<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Help!" Kasumi cries as the warrior looms over her, staring<br/>lecherously. Just as he is about to reach out to her, there is a burst<br/>of light and a cry of "Mouko Takabisha!" and Sven is hit straight on<br/>with a pride-powered ki attack.<p>"Ouch that stung," Sven said, "This might be a good fight after all...<br/>Take this!" he cries, lunging at the pigtailed hero, who, too, jumps at<br/>his opponent.<p>The two meet in midair and the space between them starts to blur with<br/>blows being exchanged. Suddenly, Ranma flies backwards into a brick<br/>wall as Sven manages to get past his defense, but Ranma shakes it off<br/>and leaps back into the fray. Once again the two become blurs, making<br/>it very hard for a non-martial artist like Kasumi to follow the fight.<p>Again there is a burst of light as Ranma lets loose a powerful Hiryuu<br/>Shouten Ha, launching the Norseman into the sky. Celebrating his<br/>victory, Ranma turns his back to the tornado and while approaching a<br/>relieved Kasumi comments, "That wasn't too bad-" but is cut off as he<br/>sees a huge ki blast heading in his direction. Just as he is about to<br/>dodge it, he realizes that if he moves, Kasumi will get hit. Mustering<br/>up all of his pride he lets loose another Mouko Takabisha which deflects<br/>Sven's blast.<p>"Hmmm... you are a skilled mortal, but I doubt you can handle THIS!"<br/>he says, cupping his hands together at his side and screams as the area<br/>between his palms start to spark with the beginnings of what is sure to<br/>be a powerful attack. ("Kuso! What kind of technique is that? It<br/>appears to be pure energy, no emotions at all... It's impossible for<br/>anyone to do that, because they would have to be emotionally dead or in<br/>a deep state of peace... chikush.") Mustering all of his resolve, Ranma<br/>follows the example of Sven and he, too, cups his hands together at his<br/>waist. Knowing that he cannot duplicate the attack he instead thinks of<br/>all of his accomplishments, of all the times he has triumphed over<br/>adversity even when the odds were against him.<p>"Foolish boy! Do you honestly believe that you can counter my attack?<br/>You are both tired and defeated. The only reason you aren't dead yet is<br/>because you are determined to save that girl behind you. If that's all<br/>you have, then I have won this battle."<p>Opening his mouth to retort, Ranma is silenced by a hand on his<br/>shoulder. Kasumi looks up at him and their eyes meet. An unspoken<br/>promise is made between the two. Suddenly, the world goes black leaving<br/>only Ranma and Kasumi standing together. Ranma once again brings his<br/>hands to his side and focuses. Something snaps and an unfamiliar energy<br/>starts to flow through his system. His eyes fly open revealing dilated<br/>pupils, and his mouth opens in a silent scream. Unable to hold onto the<br/>rapidly forming energy between his palms he releases it.<p>Sven, too, shoots his blast and the two beams collide in midair. The<br/>two combatants strain to overpower the other's attack, but neither side<br/>seems to be winning. However, Ranma is tiring quickly while Sven is<br/>still going strong.<p>Seeing this, Kasumi places both of her hands on Ranma's shoulder,<br/>closes her eyes and starts to focus. She quickly finds her center,<br/>thanks to her daily exercises, and concentrates on encouraging, not<br/>forcing, her ki to flow into Ranma.<p>Ranma feels Kasumi's aura gently nudging his and he opens his soul to<br/>hers. Silver swirls start to move around in his usually blue aura. All<br/>of this energy works its way into the blast and the beam changes from<br/>pure blue to a blue core with streaks of silver spiraling around its<br/>circumference.<p>This does not go unnoticed by the warrior, and he increases the amount<br/>of energy he puts into his attack. However the oncoming blast is too<br/>strong and it easily pushes his attack back. Soon, Ranma and Kasumi's<br/>ki blast is almost touching his palm. Raising his eyes to the sky, Sven<br/>says, "Saotome Ranma, you have fought valiantly, and truly deserve to<br/>win this battle," and with that a ray of light breaks through the clouds<br/>above and strikes the warrior in the forehead, causing him to emit a<br/>pail glow. "Goodbye, and may Father bless you and your beloved." and<br/>with that he disappeared, causing the ki blast to fly through the point<br/>where he once stood and quickly disappeared into the horizon.<p>With a slight smile on her face, Kasumi's eyes flutter and she falls<br/>face down to the ground.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Gee, Ash, this is sure a long walk to whatever random town we're<br/>visiting to make our bitc- I mean, pokemon, fight each other to near<br/>death?" Misty commented, while raising her hands above her head to<br/>stretch, "I'm starting to think the producer has us do the same thing<br/>every show so they can reuse frames..."<p>"What makes you think that, Misty?" Brock asked.<p>"Well, I remember passing that tree yesterday, and I would have thought<br/>we were going in circles if that road sign didn't say 'Tapioca Cove'."<p>"Hey, what's that?" Ash asked, pointing towards a bright object<br/>approaching rapidly from the horizon.<p>"Use your pokedex, baka!" Misty shouted, slapping Ash in the back of<br/>the head.<p>"PIKA!" Pikachu agreed, and he, too, slapped Ash in the back of the<br/>head.<p>"Ow, that hurt, you yellow bastard!" Ash yelled at Pikachu, "Just for<br/>that, I'm not using the lube tonight!"<p>"Pikaaaaaaaaa..." Pikachu sobbed.<p>Whipping it out (his pokedex you ecchi punks) he aimed the device at<br/>the oncoming object. In a computerized voice it said, "Ki Blast, an<br/>energy attack. It is composed of the spirit energy of a being or<br/>beings. If you encounter one of these, run."<p>Foolishly ignoring the warnings of the pokedex, the three sent all<br/>their pokemon to attack the blast. "Crap!" Brock swore as he saw it<br/>take down the pokemon without slowing down. Finally realizing the<br/>futility of his actions he turned to run. The three pokemon trainers<br/>and one scared pikachu (who decided to not obey the order to attack) ran<br/>like the dickens. Slowly the blast catches up to them and incinerates<br/>first Brock, then Misty and finally Ash.<p>In a rare fit of common sense, Pikachu dove off to the side, singeing<br/>his tail with a cry of "!", but then<br/>celebrated outliving those goons and the fact that he didn't have to put<br/>out for Ash anymore by dancing.<p>In the middle of his disturbing little dance there is a huge explosion<br/>off in the distance as the ki blast slams into Tapioca Cove. Shockwaves<br/>spread out from the epicenter of the blast, sending small rocks flying<br/>in every direction.<p>To seek shelter from the painful shards of rock, Pikachu huddles at the<br/>base of a cliff until the shockwave passes. Once again, he starts his<br/>disturbing dance, but once again pauses as he sees the area around him<br/>start to get dark. He looks up just in time to see a rapidly falling<br/>boulder which was dislodged by the explosion and lets out the last<br/>pika of his life before said boulder crushes him and embeds itself in<br/>the ground with a satisfying squraakchh-thunk. And that is how the<br/>world flushed its bowels, ridding the airwaves of anything and<br/>everything pokemon related. And there was much rejoicing.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Was it as good for you as it was for me?"<p>"Shut up you baka," Venus said, slapping Benten in the back of the<br/>head, "How are we going to explain the destruction of an innocent<br/>village to Father?"<p>"Well, I'm gone, see ya!" Urd blurts out while turning on a portable<br/>TV.<p>"Hold up, Urd! What are we supposed to do about those two lovebirds?"<br/>Benten asked as Urd started to climb into the screen.<p>"You're smart goddesses, figure it out!" And with that, the goddess of<br/>the past was gone.<p>"Darn, what are we going to do, Benten?" Venus asked.<p>"I have an idea..." Benten replied and started explaining her plan<br/>which was met by many squeals of laughter from Venus.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Turning around, Ranma grabbed Kasumi by her shoulders and lifted her up<br/>gently off the ground, staring into her now glazed over eyes. "Are you<br/>okay Kasumi-chan? Kasumi... KASUMI!" Her eyes remained unfocused,<br/>and Ranma's heart skipped a beat, his chest felt hollow and the world<br/>around him seemed to stop. He started to plead, his voice coming out in<br/>a hoarse whisper, tears welling in his eyes, "No, Kasumi-chan, please<br/>open your eyes... please... pleas-"<p>"Ran..chan," Kasumi whispers, "aish-" but is cut off as Ranma outs a<br/>finger to her lips, silencing her.<p>"Save your energy." And with that Ranma picks her up and roof hops<br/>home.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>The warm rays of the sun shone through the window of Kasumi's room,<br/>illuminating her angelic face resting peacefully on a pillow. Woken by<br/>the light, her eyes flutter open. Stretching, she thought, [I guess<br/>Ranma brought me here after last night. Something... odd happened... I<br/>feel as if I have found a part of me that was missing. I feel so-] but<br/>is cut off when she notices a presence in the chair next to her bed.<br/>"Ranchan," she whispered, gently caressing his cheek with a trembling<br/>hand. Jerking at her touch, Ranma's eyes shot open and his hand shoots<br/>out to grab hers, ready to defend himself against an oncoming attack.<p>"Kasumi-chan?" he questioned. The exploits of the previous night came<br/>flooding back to him. He gripped her hand tighter, silently swearing<br/>that he would never let harm come to her... at any cost. Both continue<br/>to look into the other's eyes. Their faces start to slowly move towards<br/>each other. Soon, their lips are almost touching. Kasumi feels Ranma's<br/>warm breath gently tickling her lips. She smiles, thinking, [This is<br/>what I want]. Closing her eyes, she leans in towards the martial<br/>artist, narrowing the gap between them.<p>WHAM The door flew open and the two snapped their heads apart.<br/>Standing in the doorway was a distraught Nabiki trying to catch her<br/>breath. "Sis, quick! It's late and you haven't made breakfast, so<br/>Akane has taken it upon herself to cook." No sooner were the words out<br/>of her mouth when the house shook as a large explosion was heard from<br/>the kitchen. Forgetting what had almost happened before Nabiki<br/>interrupted; Kasumi sprinted out of her room and down the stairs.<br/>[Since when could she run that quickly?] Nabiki thought. She shrugged<br/>her shoulders and left. Ranma falls out of Kasumi's closet and promptly<br/>faints from a severe nosebleed as he notices that he has several pairs<br/>of Kasumi's unmentionables stuck on his head.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Our pigtailed protagonist walked down the streets of Nerima whistling.<br/>For once it seemed as if his life was great. As he thought about Kasumi<br/>and everything that was wonderful about her, memories from the previous<br/>night started to surface. [What was that? It was more powerful than<br/>anything I have ever seen or felt before. I wish I could ask someone<br/>who knew about these things, but Happosai is hard to trap long enough to<br/>ask a question and Cologne is out of town. It would be so much easier<br/>to find an answer if I wasn't getting harassed by everyone...], his brow<br/>furrowed in thought, scaring several people. After all, Ranma thinking<br/>was one of the few strange events Nerima hadn't experienced. "Wait...<br/>Cologne's out of town... I've got it!" and with these words, Ranma<br/>disappears in a cloud of dust<hr noshade="" size="1"/>["Xian Pu, my love! Elope with me!"]<p>["Mu Tsu, don't be stupid. I love Airen, not you."]<p>"Good morning Shampoo, Mousse," Ranma said, walking in and nodding<br/>towards the myopic hidden weapons master. Sadly, the gesture was lost<br/>on him.</p><p>"Ranma..." Mousse growled, stepping between the pigtailed martial artist<br/>and his beloved.<p>"Airen come to date Shampoo, yes?"<p>"Hehe... ummm..." Ranma scratched the back of his head. "Maybe?" he<br/>replied whilst failing to dodge an Amazonian Glomp(TM) Patent Pending,<br/>in addition to several sharp shurikens (courtesy of the hidden weapons<br/>master). Pulling a bucket of water out of subspace, Shampoo threw the<br/>contents at Mousse causing him to transform and get lost in his<br/>voluminous robes.<p>"So, where Airen taking Shampoo?" Shampoo asked.<p>"Actually, Shampoo... umm..." Ranma blushed as he finally noticed<br/>Shampoo's two most obvious assets pressed against him. He started to<br/>panic, all of a sudden Kasumi's tear streaked face appeared in his<br/>mind's eye. He closed his eyes and steeled his resolve. After a deep<br/>breath he started his prepared speech. "Anyway, Shampoo, you know how<br/>Ryoga insulted my honor and I borrowed those spices?"<p>"Yes, why?"<p>"Well, I went to the library and-"<p>THUNK The Amazon fainted.<p>-5 minutes later-<p>"So you read about that in a library?" Shampoo asked incredulously.<p>"Yes"<p>"Ok, I lend it to you on two conditions. You must return it before<br/>great grandmother return. And you must give Shampoo kiss."<p>"Uh, sure, I'll get it back to you as soon as I use it. As for the<br/>kiss... close your eyes." He replied nervously.<p>"No, Shampoo know this. Airen says close eyes and then run away."<p>"This time I won't. I swear on my honor." Ranma said, raising his<br/>right hand. Complying with his wishes, she scrunched her eyes and<br/>puckered up. Reaching into subspace, Ranma pulled a kettle of hot water<br/>out of nowhere and dumped the contents onto Mousse's robes, reverting<br/>the myopic hidden weapons master back to his natural form. Before<br/>Mousse could open his mouth, he found his head roughly grabbed and his<br/>lips mashed against Shampoo's. Just as quickly as it started, Mousse<br/>found his head whipped away and doused with cold water. "Shampoo, I<br/>kept my end of the deal, now its time you kept yours."<p>"Oh, Airen such good kisser! Here, take!" she says and hands him a<br/>long bundle of cloth. Accepting the parcel, Ranma grabs Mousse and his<br/>robes and heads out. "What is Airen doing with duck boy?"<p>"Oh, I'm gonna beat some sense into him."<p>"Fine, just make sure he back before lunch rush."<p>"Sure thing, Shampoo." He said. Ranma stepped out of the Nekohanten<br/>and walked around the corner. He ducked into an alley and restored<br/>Mousse to his 'normal' form.<p>"Saotome, what... why... how-" Mousse stammered.<p>"Simple, Shampoo wanted a kiss, and I gave one to her." He quickly<br/>replied. "If you're smart, you'll realize that I want to have nothing<br/>to do with her. Mousse, I don't see you as an enemy, I never really<br/>did. I think, contrary to what most people think you would be a<br/>powerful ally. Something big is gonna happen, and having you on my side<br/>will be a great help. What do you think?" Ranma said and held his hand<br/>out.<p>Accepting the proffered handshake, Mousse nodded. "Saotome, I think<br/>this is going to be the start of a beautiful friendship."<p>====================================================<br/>End of Chapter 6<p>What happens next time? Hehe, wouldn't you like to know? No? Oh...<br/>ok...<p>Oh, and please, no emails about pokemon bashing. All flames will be<br/>redirected to the squirrels.<p>This was a difficult chapter to write. Although I practice the art,<br/>it's very hard to verbalize a fight scene pictured in your head. This<br/>chapter was probably rewritten four times before I got the effect I<br/>wanted, and even then, I'm still not too satisfied with my job. I also<br/>started another fic to experiment with my writing... 'The Bucket'<br/>(working title).<p>I can't guarantee when the next chapter will come out, but I promise you<br/>there will be another. Maybe over summer vacation.<p>I'd like to thank yingchan meimei for her encouragement.<p>Website: .com<br/>E-Mail: fanfiction (at) jhu (dot) edu<br/>E-Mail: arusahni (at) hotmail (dot) com<br/>AIM: tmbg007<p>Ja Ne!</p>
