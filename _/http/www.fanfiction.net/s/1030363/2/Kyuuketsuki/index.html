</div>Kyuuketsuki<br/>(Vampire)<br/>A Ranma 1/2 fanfiction by Zorknot (W. Brad Robinson)<p>DISCLAIMER: Ranma 1/2 is the property of Takahashi<br/>Rumiko, Viz Video, Kitty Films, and Shogakukan.<p>The prologue to this fic and all of my other fics can<br/>be found here:<p>Or here<p>Chapter 1: Ta Ro Ichi Kon<br/>~~~~~[START]~~~~~<p>Sometimes at night, the house spoke to Kasumi.<br/>Sometimes it would squeak with glee for being so<br/>clean and full of loving people. A lot of times it<br/>would groan about the mess still left over from<br/>Akane-chan's latest creation or the hole in the roof<br/>from grandfather Happosai being punted into the<br/>stratosphere. Late at night, while she stared at her<br/>ceiling, Kasumi fancied she had entire conversations<br/>with the house. She would often hum a soothing melody<br/>to it to make it feel better as she drifted off to<br/>sleep. She even took to calling it "Uchi-chan." The<br/>house seemed to like that.<p>She and Uchi-chan had been through a lot. Dojo<br/>destroyers, mischievous oni, gigantic<br/>yeti/bull/crane/snake/octopus hybrids, and most<br/>recently a wedding that was more like a small war.<br/>Kasumi sighed. Poor Uchi-chan barely had enough time<br/>to recover from one disaster before another one<br/>happened right on its heels, but it was still her<br/>ever-present friend and confidant. It still was her<br/>family's protector...and the Saotomes' protector too,<br/>especially now that Auntie was living there as well.<p>So many loved ones under one roof... and all only a<br/>few days after such an uproar...It was nights like<br/>tonight that Kasumi would wake up in a cold sweat and<br/>short of breath, worrying. It was nights like tonight<br/>she calmed herself by listening to Uchi-chan's<br/>squeaks and groans. Despite the chaos that<br/>Ranma had caused over the past year, things were a<br/>lot less strained. In fact, Ranma's problems seemed<br/>to be a stinging salve for the Tendos' own<br/>difficulties. Kasumi had been having her nightmares<br/>less and less, and Uchi-chan, despite its<br/>complaining, seemed happier...more alive.<p>Kasumi's eyes found her alarm clock. The glowing<br/>green digits told her it was 12:40. Her tired mind<br/>debated for a moment whether that was early or late.<p>Tonight's nightmare had been bad... something to do<br/>with blood...and her family's sword, but even so her<br/>eyes were already drooping, and Kasumi almost fell<br/>back asleep without listening to Uchi-chan's sounds<br/>much at all. Kasumi didn't feel right about going to<br/>sleep without saying hello to Uchi-chan though. So,<br/>just for a minute, she listened...<p>Kasumi suddenly felt uneasy. There was something<br/>different. The house's noises seemed more strained,<br/>more insistent, like it was trying to tell her<br/>something... Then the house started screaming.<p>"Wait," Kasumi spoke softly, half awake, "that's<br/>not Uchi-chan that's..." Kasumi sat up in bed, her<br/>eyes wide "Nabiki!...?" Kasumi listened closer. It<br/>was most definitely a human scream, and it was most<br/>definitely her sister. "Oh my!" Kasumi said as her<br/>fingers touched her lips.<p>Kasumi paused to think... Maybe Nabiki-chan was just<br/>acting, she had done that before... Kasumi only<br/>listened for a second more before she was out of bed<br/>and in her slippers. No actress could scream like<br/>that. No actress would want to. She couldn't wait for<br/>Ranma or Akane. If they hadn't gotten up by now<br/>something was wrong. She had to do something...but<br/>what? "Ohhhhhh!" She paced hurriedly around the area<br/>by her bed as she tried desperately to think of<br/>something. All the while, her younger sister was<br/>screaming. Nabiki-chan was screaming!<p>Attracted by the glint of moonlight off the silver,<br/>her eyes found the cross necklace on her nightstand.<br/>It had been her mother's. It was a plain, silver<br/>cross, not all that different from any other such<br/>necklace. It had no obvious decoration. In fact,<br/>there was only one thing odd about it. On one side of<br/>the cross, four kanji characters were inscribed. They<br/>read, "Many paths, one soul."<p>She grasped it and held it to her chest. "Oh<br/>Mother! What am I going to do?" This wasn't the first<br/>time Kasumi had awakened to the sounds of an intruder.<br/>The night Ryoga challenged Ranma she had thought Ryoga<br/>was a burglar. But, even though she had felt a sense<br/>of danger then too, she somehow knew that everyone<br/>would be okay.<p>This was different. Nabiki was SCREAMING. She was<br/>HURTING. Someone or something was hurting her. Now,<br/>unlike that night with Ryoga, there was a terrible<br/>urgency intertwined with the fear. If she tried to<br/>wake up Akane or Ranma... she might be too late.<p>She might be too late anyway.<p>Kasumi held the cross in front of her in cupped<br/>hands, hoping to find some answer in the smooth,<br/>reflective metal.<p>"Protect them all, Kasumi-chan" the cross seemed to<br/>say, "Protect your family, and yourself... I love<br/>you. I always will"<p>Those were the last words her mother said to a<br/>puzzled Kasumi before she left her the cross and<br/>breathed her last breath. Slowly, Kasumi fastened the<br/>necklace around her neck. "I'll try mother. I'll<br/>try."<p>Resolved, but not at all calm, Kasumi opened the<br/>door. Looking down the hall she saw a bluish glow<br/>emanating from Nabiki's room. "Oh my!" Kasumi's<br/>fingers touched her lips as she quickly jumped back<br/>in her room and closed the door. Her heart raced.<br/>Maybe she could just wait for Ranma or Akane anyway.<br/>They had to have heard the scream by now, and they<br/>were used to this sort of thing.<p>They were supposed to stop the bad people and<br/>Kasumi was supposed to clean up afterwards. That's<br/>the way it always was and that was the way Kasumi<br/>liked it. She could deal with dirty floors. She could<br/>deal with holes in the ceiling. She could even deal<br/>with puddles of congealed ectoplasm provided the<br/>poltergeist that created them was properly<br/>exorcized...<p>There was something glowing and attacking her<br/>sister. She had no idea how to deal with that, and...<br/>she was afraid to see it. "I'm scared, Mother!" tears<br/>came freely from Kasumi's eyes as she clutched the<br/>cross necklace.<p>Ranma...what would he do in a situation like this?<br/>Kasumi smiled in spite of herself at the thought.<br/>Ranma would just burst through the door and start<br/>attacking without so much as second spent wondering<br/>whether or not he could defeat what was beyond it. He<br/>would never do something so cowardly as hide in his<br/>room crying while his sister screams...<p>Akane and Ranma were taking too long. Kasumi glanced<br/>at the clock. 12:42. Her sister had been in pain for<br/>nearly two minutes! She had to go. Now.<p>Kasumi opened the door to the hall again. Nabiki's<br/>screams were more raw now as they echoed through the<br/>hallway. Kasumi had to do something. She would never<br/>forgive herself if she didn't.<p>As she walked steadily toward the glowing door,<br/>Kasumi thought of her options. There was no way she<br/>could stop whatever was in Nabiki's room, but maybe<br/>she could distract it long enough for her sister to<br/>get away and then find Ranma or Akane. But she wasn't<br/>sure if she could even distract it. She obviously<br/>posed no threat...<p>Kasumi found herself at the door. Nabiki's screams<br/>were lessening. Praying that somehow Nabiki was<br/>alright and bracing herself for what lay beyond,<br/>Kasumi reached for the knob and pulled the door open...<p>Nabiki was writhing on her bed. Her pajamas were<br/>tattered and stained with blood. She and her attacker<br/>were both glowing an intense blue- the source of the<br/>light. The attacker was bending over Nabiki, its<br/>mouth on her neck. It was also wearing pajamas, and<br/>oddly, appeared female...with red hair in a pigtail.<p>"Ranma?" Kasumi asked in shock. The attacker<br/>paused, then whirled around to face Kasumi with a<br/>feral snarl. The hair was wild, the eyes were pupil-<br/>less and glowing an actinic blue. Matching blue-white<br/>fangs protruded out of the mouth, but it was Ranma-<br/>chan's face. "W-would you like some tea?"<p>The fanged, demonic looking Onna-Ranma knitted<br/>her brow in confusion for a moment. Nabiki's body<br/>went slack on the bed, her head lolling to one side,<br/>her eyes eerily open. "No," Ranma said, "I don't want<br/>any tea..." She rose from the bed and glided rapidly<br/>to Kasumi in the doorway. Looking up at the taller<br/>girl Ranma-chan smiled cruelly, showing her glowing<br/>fangs. "I would like some fresh blood though."<p>"Oh my!" Kasumi's fingers went to her lips again.<p>"You picked a real bad time to interrupt me."<br/>Ranma-chan placed two hands on Kasumi's stomach. For<br/>a moment Kasumi stood, looking down at Ranma in<br/>confusion. Then it hit.<p>At first, all Kasumi felt was a severe pressure as<br/>she was blown back into the wall behind her in a<br/>flash of blue light. Then she felt the pain.<br/>Excruciating, sickening pain. She looked down. There<br/>was a wide, quivering, gaping hole where her stomach<br/>once was. She wondered crazily what the long white<br/>thing was.<p>She realized it was her spine.<p>"That's right, bitch," the terrible creature using<br/>Ranma-chan's body said, "Just be a good girl and die<br/>over there while I finish. And don't get back up<br/>until I bring you back to life."<p>Kasumi was already growing faint, darkness<br/>impinging on her vision, by the time Ranma-chan turned<br/>back into Nabiki's room. Kasumi dully realized she was<br/>going into shock. Not enough blood was getting to her<br/>brain. It was leaving her, abandoning her. Life was<br/>abandoning her. It was being burned by gastric juices<br/>as it poured onto the floor.<p>Kasumi weakly brought her hand to her cross. She<br/>grasped it with all her remaining strength. "I'm<br/>sorry, Mother," she whispered through the blood in<br/>her throat, "I'm...sorry." Her eyes closed. She had<br/>failed...failed... Nabiki in the<br/>hands of a demon. Demon hands, hands of fate of God<br/>of dying death a doorway pain the end remain here do<br/>not die save her save her death pain mom's chocolate<br/>chip cookies burning stomach pain love need...<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Where am I?<p>Just below the ceiling.<p>Oh.<p>It's a good ceiling. Uchi-chan's ceiling. I can<br/>feel its energy...<p>Hello, Uchi-chan!<p>There's a shiver in the energy. Something is<br/>wrong.<p>Am I dead?<p>Oh yes, that explains a few things...<p>Nabiki is in trouble.<p>Where is Mother? Mother can handle it. Mother always<br/>took care of everything.<p>No. Mother is...somewhere else. Heaven maybe. I am<br/>still here.<p>Maybe I should wake Ranma up?<p>No, Ranma was the one that killed me.<p>Really? That's odd. She seemed like such a nice<br/>girl... when she wasn't a boy. She was a nice boy too<br/>of course... But she killed me. That wasn't very nice...<p>Something bad is happening...<p>Maybe Akane? She's a martial artist. She could<br/>handle it maybe.<p>Didn't she almost die though? Who saved her?<p>Ranma.<p>Oh.<p>Something really bad is going on in the next room.<p>Father?<p>No time. Nabiki might be dying.<p>Not Grandfather Happosai,<p>Not Uncle Saotome,<p>Not Nodoka...<p>There were many paths, but Kasumi was only one<br/>soul. As the idea that maybe, just maybe she could<br/>still do something echoed through whatever she was<br/>using to think, her way became clear. The various<br/>parts of her came to the decision at more or less the<br/>same time. Using Uchi-chan's energy as a guide, she<br/>drifted into Nabiki's room. Ranma-chan was just<br/>lowering her mouth to Nabiki's neck again.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>No. Stop the pain. End it. Protect her.<p>But how can I do anything if I'm dead!<p>No. Not dead.<p>But...<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Kasumi had to stop it. She had to stop Nabiki's<br/>pain. She concentrated on Ranma, trying to pull her<br/>away from Nabiki. She felt herself get heavier. She<br/>felt herself... regaining feeling. She opened her<br/>eyes and saw her hands on Ranma-chan's shoulders<br/>right before they jerked backwards. Kasumi fell,<br/>bringing Ranma-chan with her. Kasumi blinked. Somehow<br/>she was alive, without any wounds, in Nabiki's room,<br/>naked, except, she realized, she still had the cross<br/>sandwiched between her hand and Ranma-chan's<br/>shoulder.<p>Ranma-chan did not move immediately. She laid still<br/>on top of Kasumi long enough for Kasumi to wonder<br/>if she was ever going to move. Finally she spoke.<br/>"So. You're the Kouken... I suppose it makes sense in<br/>a strange way..." Ranma-chan leapt off Kasumi in a<br/>blur and suddenly she was straddling her. She held up<br/>her hand and made what looked at first like the sign<br/>for victory or peace.<p>Then blue energy grew out of the two fingers. "Now<br/>lets see... I just need to pierce one of your chakras<br/>with my ki to kill you...which one will it be?" She<br/>brought her hand over Kasumi's bare breasts. "The<br/>heart? No, too dramatic. Besides, you're too well<br/>protected there."<p>The hand drifted over to Kasumi's brow. "Your<br/>forehead? No, as interesting as piercing your third<br/>eye would be, it wouldn't be worth the effort."<p>Ranma-chan brought the ki-extended fingers down on<br/>Kasumi's neck. "Yes, of course. Visuddha, the throat<br/>chakra. Seat of consciousness and the ability to<br/>communicate what you know and feel...My favorite." The<br/>ends of the extension of each finger dug deep into the<br/>wood on either side of Kasumi. "And of course I won't<br/>have to worry about you turning into kasumi again and<br/>getting away, because I'm using my legs to cover your<br/>lower chakras with my ki." Ranma's face came nose to<br/>nose with Kasumi's as the fanged demon smiled, "In<br/>other words...You're trapped."<p>"What do you mean 'turn into Kasumi?' I'm Kasumi<br/>now."<p>Ranma-chan managed to look confused for a moment,<br/>then she smiled again allowing full view of her fangs.<br/>"That's right, that's your name too isn't it? Your<br/>parents named you Mist. How cute! Too bad they hadn't<br/>trained you better. As I said, you won't be turning<br/>into your namesake again any time soon. You failed,<br/>Kouken."<p>Kasumi stared into the awful creature's glowing<br/>blue eyes in shock She realized something she was<br/>only dimly aware of before: there was no way this<br/>could be Ranma. "Who are you?"<p>The creature backed off a bit "I am a vampire. A<br/>kyuuketsuki. I am going to kill you. Nothing else<br/>matters beyond that." Kasumi frowned. Something else<br/>about this creature... It wasn't stupid, or without<br/>emotion. Although it controlled Ranma now, Kasumi<br/>could see it had lived its own life once.<p>Suddenly she felt sharp pain on either side of her<br/>neck. The kyuuketsuki was bringing her fingers<br/>together...<p>"This is going to be slow, and extremely painful."<br/>The kyuuketsuki smiled even wider. "I for one am going<br/>to love every second of it."<p>The razor sharp ki extensions from the vampire's<br/>fingers bit deeper into Kasumi's neck. Any time now<br/>they would cut through the Jugular vein and Carotid<br/>artery. In desperation, Kasumi clutched the cross,<br/>still in her right hand, close to her heart.<p>The vampire who wore the face of Ranma laughed<br/>mirthlessly. "How quaint! If this were some idiotic<br/>horror movie you might actually be lucky." The<br/>kyuuketsuki's features turned serious. "But it isn't,<br/>and you're not." The vampire's fingers bit deeper.<br/>Kasumi gasped. She felt the blood spurt out from her<br/>neck. "Heh, religion...false comfort for the weak and<br/>perverse instrument of the powerful." The vampire<br/>brought her fingers closer...<p>"It was my mother's." Kasumi said softly with tear<br/>filled eyes. She was delirious from all that had<br/>happened in such a short time. She was going to<br/>die... again. For a moment she thought... but there<br/>was no way she could protect her family now. There<br/>never really was. She was going to die for real this<br/>time... She would join her mother soon. All the pain<br/>would soon be over. She relaxed. The<br/>corners of her mouth curled up slightly as she<br/>thought of how the cross she held had kept her alive for<br/>almost eleven years after...it... happened. She<br/>looked straight into the unnatural eyes of the<br/>kyuuketsuki...and spoke, even as her vision began to<br/>fade "The only belief that I have is that she is<br/>somewhere, watching over me. I...cherish... that<br/>belief more than anything, and I will not allow it<br/>to be taken from me...or dismissed."<p>The vampire snarled and brought her fingers still<br/>closer together. "I dismiss it. And after I kill you<br/>and make you my slave, I'm going to destroy your cross,<br/>and your stupid belief along with it."<p>Kasumi suddenly felt an invading presence. At first<br/>it was vague, intangible, but gradually, she became<br/>aware of dark emotions, of greed and bloodlust and...<br/>hunger. Then, there was something else, a tiny<br/>glimmer of light in a dark tunnel. Kasumi started to<br/>pursue it, but that was when the pain came.<p>The cuts on her neck were minor trifles. This was<br/>true pain. White hot molten metal burned through<br/>Kasumi's veins. Sandpaper rubbed against her eyes. Her<br/>fingernails were pulled off her fingers. Her teeth<br/>were twisted in their sockets. A terrible keening<br/>shrill sound filled her ears. "Ah, you feel it now,<br/>don't you?" the vampire's voice came from far away.<br/>"The exquisite pain of my energy subverting yours.<br/>Soon you will be nothing more than an empty husk with<br/>no will of your own. Then again, that's more or less<br/>how you've been living, anyway."<p>~NO~<p>The thought wasn't a plea, but a command. Kasumi<br/>felt her own presence, her own aura, gather around<br/>the center of her being. She was dimly aware that the<br/>area around her physical body had gotten brighter,<br/>almost as if she herself were glowing...<p>She felt the vampire's aura hesitate, like a<br/>nocturnal creature in a sudden light, before it<br/>lunged at her. Seconds went by like hours as their<br/>two auras fought each other. Each time the vampire<br/>came close to reaching her exposed center, she would<br/>think of her mother, her family, and her promise, and<br/>she gained new strength, pushing the vampire back.<br/>Slowly, Kasumi gained ground. The vampire's aura grew<br/>weaker and Kasumi's grew stronger until suddenly, she<br/>realized she was no longer defending but attacking.<br/>She could destroy the vampire once and for all! She<br/>could utterly obliterate it...<br/>...and Ranma as well.<p>~It feels good doesn't it, Kouken?~ It was the<br/>vampire! ~Go ahead, go that extra step, assimilate me,<br/>gain my strength. Your little martial arts friend is<br/>here too, he has a lot of strength, very tasty. It's<br/>not like anyone would miss him either, after all he's<br/>just a freeloader.~<p>Kasumi's aura stopped whipping out against the<br/>vampire's. Kasumi kept it from going any further, but<br/>it was like containing a flame, or damming a raging<br/>river. Desperately she called out mentally to Ranma-<br/>chan hoping that maybe she could keep from destroying<br/>her if she could just separate Ranma from the<br/>vampire. There was just the slightest reaction. It<br/>was miniscule compared the tempest raging between the<br/>two auras, like a the movement of a baby's little toe<br/>amidst a battle of giants. Kasumi saw it though and<br/>pulled, trying to tug it loose from the vampire's<br/>grasp.<p>~This is pointless~ the vampire projected suddenly,<br/>relinquishing her hold on Ranma.<p>Kasumi was snapped back into her body. She blinked,<br/>not believing that she could suddenly be laying on the<br/>floor of her sister's bedroom once again.<p>The vampire inhabiting Ranma stood unsteadily, its<br/>face half illuminated by the sodium streetlamp through<br/>the window, and looked down at Kasumi with half-lidded,<br/>dimly glowing eyes. "Point goes to you, Kouken. Are<br/>you happy? Do you realize how little this victory<br/>matters?" The bloodsucker squinted Ranma's eyes. "No.<br/>You don't know anything do you? You don't even<br/>realize what you are." Crossing Ranma-chan's arms, the<br/>kyuuketsuki said one final word: "Pitiful."<p>An intense glow emanated from Ranma's body for a moment<br/>and then abruptly it was gone. Like a marionette with its<br/>strings suddenly cut, Ranma collapsed, unconscious.<p>Kasumi sat up and felt both sides of her neck. There<br/>were the raised ridges of scars... But no blood. How<br/>was it possible? She looked out of the doorway into<br/>the dark of the hall. She could barely make out the<br/>outline of her clothes and slippers in a depression<br/>in the wall. How was any of it possible?<p>She looked at Ranma's unconscious body for a moment<br/>trying to figure out what had just happened. Was the<br/>vampire gone? Was everyone safe now? Kasumi wanted to<br/>believe so but it just happened too soon, and what<br/>the vampire had said...She felt adrenaline seep out of<br/>her, leaving only fatigue. She realized with some<br/>surprise that someone else was standing in the room.<br/>Slowly, she turned and looked up. It was Nabiki. She<br/>was leaning against the wall, a robe now covering her<br/>tattered pajamas. Dried blood was visible on her neck,<br/>arms, and calves, but as far as Kasumi could tell,<br/>there were no open wounds. Yet another mystery.<p>Kasumi then became aware of another fact: Nabiki was<br/>wielding a baseball bat.<p>Kasumi quickly got in between her sister and Ranma.<br/>"Nabiki, she's Ranma again. Ranma-chan is innocent in<br/>all this."<p>"How do you know that 'neechan?" Nabiki's voice was<br/>hoarse and weak.<p>"I ...I guess I don't. But why would the vampire<br/>pass out like that?"<p>Nabiki shook her head and raised the bat in her<br/>shaking grasp "I don't care." She swallowed, "I still<br/>want to hit her. Him. Whatever. The bastard can't even<br/>pick a gender and stick with it."<p>"Oh my! I don't think you should say that!"<br/>Kasumi's fingers touched her lips.<p>"Why not, Kasumi?" Nabiki demanded. "Don't you know<br/>what that...bitch did to me?"<p>"Gomen nasai, imoutochan," Kasumi apologized to her<br/>sister, "I'm not quite sure... I just got the feeling<br/>when you said that, that it was going to come back to<br/>you."<p>"You got the feeling..." Nabiki repeated apparently<br/>finding Kasumi's response a little odd. "Kasumi, what<br/>the hell happened?" Nabiki shuffled unsteadily to the<br/>light switch and flicked it on. "What was with that<br/>light show between you and Ranma? And why are you... in<br/>your birthday suit?"<p>Kasumi looked out in the hall at her clothes. She<br/>looked at the cross still in her right hand. "I'm<br/>afraid I really don't know, Nabiki-chan. I wish I<br/>did." There was an awkward pause. Then Kasumi spoke<br/>again "Do you want some tea?"<p>Nabiki laughed, though there wasn't much mirth in<br/>it. "Tea. Your miracle cure. Helps with everything<br/>from colds to bad moods to...whatever the hell that<br/>was." Nabiki sighed and relaxed, propping the bat up<br/>on her shoulder. She rubbed her throat with her free<br/>hand "Maybe it's not such a bad idea, though... Here,"<br/>Nabiki took off her robe and handed it to Kasumi, who<br/>accepted it with a weak smile "no charge... I've...got<br/>to think for a bit...I...Meet me downstairs, okay?"<br/>Nabiki started to walk out of the room.<p>Kasumi was just about to think of getting up and<br/>getting dressed when Nabiki turned around. "Wait a<br/>minute, where is Akane? Shouldn't she be bashing Ranma's<br/>head in with a hammer by now? In fact... Kasumi, is<br/>everyone else still asleep?"<p>Kasumi nodded. "I think so, Nabiki."<p>"Now why is that do you suspect?"<p>Kasumi felt a chill pass down her spine as the answer<br/>came upon her. "I think... there are more of the<br/>vampires...here."<p>Nabiki took a large, unsteady step toward Kasumi.<br/>"Nani? There are more of these things?" Nabiki kicked<br/>Ranma for emphasis.<p>"I'm afraid so."<p>Nabiki gripped the bat tighter. "G-great. I've got<br/>the perfect plan. I'll wave this bat around<br/>ineffectually, and you can offer refreshments."<p>There was a rustling sound and Nabiki and Kasumi watched<br/>as Ranma's arm jerked and then relaxed. It moved again<br/>slowly pressing against the floor. Ranma's torso rose<br/>up unsteadily. Out of her mouth there issued forth a<br/>terrible moan...<p>Kasumi saw Nabiki's eyes narrow as she prepared to swing...<p>Ranma sat up and rubbed the back of her head, eyes<br/>squeezed shut, confusion readily visible on her face.<br/>"Ack! My head feels like Akane cooked it! What's goin<br/>on?"<p>Nabiki lunged past Kasumi and swung at Ranma with the<br/>Bat. She connected with Ranma's head.<p>Ranma fell to the ground.<p>"Nabiki!" Kasumi crawled over to Ranma and shot a<br/>accusing glare at Nabiki. "How dare you hurt Ranma-<br/>chan like that! Can't you see she's been through<br/>enough?"<p>"Kasumi, I'm sorry," Nabiki's eyes snapped their<br/>focus to Kasumi, "but I don't fucking care whether<br/>that's Ranma, a vampire, or Amateresu come out of her<br/>fucking cave. Whoever it was that...hurt me... used<br/>that body...and that body deserves to be damaged."<p>Ranma sat up holding a hand to the side of her<br/>head. "Kasumi, she's right. I mean, thanks for carin<br/>and all, but even if it wasn't me, even if there was<br/>nothin I could do ta get Lili ta stop, I feel guilty.<br/>I need the pain as much as she needed ta hit me."<p>"Wait a minute," Nabiki crouched next to Ranma and<br/>grabbed her by the collar of her spiral decorated<br/>pajamas. "You know that bitch's NAME?"<p>"Yeah. I know her name...Feng Lili." Ranma got to<br/>her feet and Nabiki followed, still grabbing Ranma's<br/>pajamas. Kasumi could see Ranma's fists were clenched.<br/>She was almost shaking with rage. "And if she ever<br/>does come back ya gotta let me help ya kill her."<p>Kasumi felt a sad, uneasy, unclean feeling come over<br/>her. The same feeling she had felt for more than a<br/>decade. All she would have to do is give Uchi-chan a<br/>good thorough cleaning and it would go away, but Kasumi<br/>wondered. She wondered why, when she had thought of Ranma<br/>killing Lili, she had smiled.<p>Kasumi realized her fingers were at her lips, her<br/>mouth almost open. "Oh my," she murmured softly and<br/>brought her hand to her side.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Sometimes at night<br/>When cold winds moan<br/>I sit and wonder,<br/>All alone.<p>Am I really living?<p>A hidden hate within me burns<br/>A hidden heart within me yearns<p>I must be strong<br/>I must smile through the pain<br/>But sometimes I want to run away<br/>Sometimes...<br/>I feel things I can't explain...<br/>-Fr.
