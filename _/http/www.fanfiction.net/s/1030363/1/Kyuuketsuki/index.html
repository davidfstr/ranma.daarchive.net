</div>Kyuuketsuki<br/>(Vampire)<br/>A Ranma1/2 fanfiction by Zorknot (W. Brad Robinson)<p>DISCLAIMER: Jusenkyo and many the characters<br/>portrayed here are the intellectual property of<br/>Rumiko Takahashi, Kitty films, and Shogakukan.<p>NOTES: This fic is pretty dark and has some rather<br/>violent scenes. It is a continuation of sorts,<br/>starting a few days after the last volume of the<br/>manga. Some of the Chinese names I use are different<br/>from convention. Here are the names as they appear in<br/>cannon and how they will appear here. Real Chinese would<br/>probably never have names such as these, but I felt they<br/>needed to be changed for this fic.<p>Jusenkyo Guide- Gurei Pu<br/>Plum- Pei Lum<br/>Saffron- Sa Furan<br/>Cologne- Ko Lon<br/>Shampoo- Shan Pu<br/>Village of Amazons- Nyuuchezutswun<p>PREREADERS:I would like to thank the following people<br/>for helping me with this chapter. Any errors are<br/>purely my own of course.<p>KpJam<br/>Akraen<br/>Nightman<br/>Nemesis Zero<br/>Edward Simmons<br/>Dracos<p>Prologue: Twilight at Jusenkyo<p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~<p>A cold wind blew over the Jusenkyo springs, causing<br/>Gurei Pu to shiver. The springs were actually more of<br/>a large, if shallow lake now. It had been nearly a<br/>month since Ranma had defeated Sa Furan and caused the<br/>springs to flood, and they still showed no signs of<br/>receding. Gurei did not want to be here. It was cold<br/>and wet and dull. He wished more than ever that he<br/>could go back to his home in the village, where it<br/>was warm and bright, where his wife and daughter would<br/>be waiting, but until the water drained away and the<br/>individual springs were once again discernable, that<br/>was just a far off dream. As the Jusenkyo Guide this<br/>was probably the most important task he would have to<br/>perform.<p>Gurei wondered how the Tendos and Saotomes were<br/>doing in Japan. He wondered what sort of chaos the<br/>barrel of Nannichuan he sent to them had caused. He<br/>knew that curing the curse was nigh impossible, that<br/>the spirits of the springs would not allow themselves<br/>to cancel each other out willingly, but the Guide had<br/>always been an optimist. He hoped against probability<br/>that Ranma had been able to cure himself. He<br/>certainly deserved it. Gurei picked up a small stone<br/>and threw it into the lake. It skipped seven times<br/>before plunking into the water above Shounichuan, the<br/>spring of drowned elephant. Gurei sighed. He actually<br/>hoped the marriage didn't happen...that somehow it<br/>was called off. If Akane and Ranma were married, then<br/>things would be that much worse...because Akane would<br/>eventually have to return to Jusenkyo. She had her<br/>own spring...her own tragic story.<p>The Akanenichuan was one of the few springs that<br/>did not have a bamboo pole sticking out of it. The<br/>poles were not ordinary. They were infused with ki<br/>and protected from the weathering of nature by arcane<br/>magic, sigils burned into their bases before they<br/>were placed in the earth. Akane's spring would<br/>need a pole soon. The elders were already busy making<br/>one.<p>There were times when the Guide hated the elders.<br/>Sometimes he even hated the whole village. It was his<br/>duty to stay by Jusenkyo, alone, guarding the springs<br/>and laying witness to tragedy after tragedy simply<br/>because he inherited a unique immunity to the springs<br/>from his father, a man he had barely even met. Even<br/>now, as he approached old age, had learned to respect<br/>Jusenkyo and its rich history, and had become a<br/>father himself, he felt the old resentment like a<br/>heavy acidity in his stomach. Sometimes he felt like<br/>he too was one of the accursed spirits of Jusenkyo,<br/>tied to it his whole life, only able to live<br/>vicariously through the people that visited him.<br/>Sometimes, the Guide thought that if he had to spend<br/>an eternity like this and was suddenly set free, he'd<br/>go on a murderous rampage too.<p>That's what would happen if the poles fell. The<br/>spirits, no longer having anything tying them to the<br/>spring, would take over the bodies of those they had<br/>cursed, and wreak havoc upon the living world. There<br/>were one or two benevolent spirits, the spirit of<br/>Sounichuan, the spring of drowned priest, being<br/>notable among them, but even these spirits had a dark<br/>nature. Their souls still belonged to the demon<br/>imprisoned in the source of Jusenkyo's waters.<br/>However good their intentions, their actions would<br/>always serve evil.<p>The methods of protecting the poles had improved<br/>over the centuries, but that didn't mean there<br/>couldn't be mistakes. Although magic found ways<br/>around almost every rule of nature, it could not ever<br/>completely escape one most important physical law,<br/>the law of entropy.<p>The poles HAD fallen before, and if they were going<br/>to fall again, now, when the springs were flooded and<br/>indistinct, would be the time. Gurei kept watching<br/>the springs, despite the loneliness and boredom. He<br/>watched them for the village, for the Jusenkyo cursed<br/>people of Nerima, whom he counted among his friends,<br/>but most of all he watched the poles for his daughter,<br/>Pei Lum.<p>Pei got herself cursed because she wanted to follow<br/>in her father's footsteps. She walked right into<br/>Nyannichuan, hoping that she, like her father would<br/>be immune. She was not. For the most part, Pei's<br/>curse wasn't much of a curse at all, but if the poles<br/>fell...<p>Gurei didn't want to think about it. He took his<br/>long, wooden pipe out of his shirt pocket along with<br/>some tobacco, filled the pipe, lit it with a match,<br/>and inhaled slowly. Another cold wind passed through<br/>him and he thought seriously about starting a fire.<br/>Fall was definitely coming on strong this year. He<br/>blew the smoke out of his mouth forming an "o" in the<br/>air in front of him. Maybe Pei would visit him<br/>tomorrow. That would be nice...<p>When the first pole fell, Gurei thought he was<br/>seeing things. There was no sound. No reason to see<br/>it at all except that he happened to be looking<br/>through his smoke ring at the time. The pole just<br/>leaned slowly to the left until the bottom bobbed up<br/>with an eerie grace and the entire pole was floating<br/>horizontally on the surface of the water. It was<br/>starting to get dark, and since it had already been<br/>overcast to begin with, Gurei blinked, rubbed his<br/>eyes and blinked again hoping it was just his<br/>imagination running on worry.<p>It was not.<p>The second pole was unmistakable. It fell quickly,<br/>almost as if cut from underneath. It splooshed into<br/>the water and bobbed up and down with Gurei's heart.<br/>Gurei threw his pipe to the ground and leapt into the<br/>water. He had to put the poles back into the earth<br/>before...<p>Gurei heard another splash and saw another pole go<br/>down right next to him. There wasn't time to think...<br/>he angled himself over to the newly dropped pole and<br/>grabbed it. The water here was only chest high. He<br/>stood up, his shoes sinking in the soft mud. He<br/>raised the pole into the air and shoved it into the<br/>ground as far as he could. He read the marking on the<br/>pole. This was one of the four poles that bound the<br/>spirit of Rounichuan, the spring of drowned wolf.<br/>Gurei remembered the spirit's name...Ran Binrui.<p>Binrui was turned into a wolf by a powerful<br/>sorcerer two thousand, seven hundred years ago. In<br/>order to once again regain human form and express his<br/>love to the sorcerer's daughter, Binrui drowned<br/>himself in the cursed waters of Jusenkyo, ceding his<br/>very soul to the demon that was the source of<br/>Jusenkyo's magic. Despite his originally noble ideals,<br/>Binrui had slaughtered hundreds in Europe a thousand<br/>years later. Many others he afflicted with the wolf<br/>curse, making them his slaves. He was generous to his<br/>minions. He allowed them their own lives for as long<br/>as the moon was not full. On nights when it was,<br/>however they were to viciously hunt down any human<br/>they saw. Binrui was so successful, his minions so<br/>commonplace, they gained their own name... werewolves.<br/>He had finally been forced back to the springs almost<br/>one hundred fifty years ago.<p>Gurei recalled all of this in an instant as he held<br/>the pole. "Ran Binrui, spirit of the wolf. You have<br/>killed many for your love. Kill no more. Rest in this<br/>place and be content. You have done enough. Nomfir<br/>ardfarl ben singrei, srat por lavat!" A red glow<br/>surrounded the pole as the incantation activated the<br/>sigils. The pole sank a few inches deeper into the<br/>ground. The pole was back in place.<p>Gurei turned to go after the first two poles, when<br/>suddenly he felt a strong current in the water<br/>through his clothing. He looked back.<p>Suddenly, all four poles of Rounichuan shot up into<br/>the air, leaving a trail of water before falling back<br/>down into the lake. For a moment, there was silence,<br/>and then, like dominoes, the other poles began to<br/>fall one after the other.<p>Gurei stood in the ice cold water, shocked. This<br/>wasn't simply the result of the enchantments wearing<br/>down, there was something MAKING the poles come down.<br/>Jusenkyo...was waking up.<p>There was no way Gurei could stop this. The village<br/>had to be warned. He swam through the numbingly cold<br/>water to the shore. Once there, Gurei ran as fast as<br/>he could to his makeshift stable next to his shack.<br/>The Amazons had given him a horse after the springs<br/>flooded. It was a pure breed Arabian horse, its color<br/>a brilliant copper. Gurei had accepted the gift<br/>gratefully, even though he knew they had given it to<br/>him purely out of fear that something might happen to<br/>the springs. It was a good horse. He fed it and rode<br/>it often. He found he enjoyed riding through the low<br/>grade paths in the mountains. They hadn't told him<br/>the horse's name so he named it Ranma. It was his<br/>daughter's idea.<p>Ranma was rearing up on his back legs, his eyes<br/>wide. He whinnied in fear at something that only he<br/>could detect at the moment. Gurei knew what it was.<br/>What they were. They hadn't escaped yet, the spirits<br/>moved slow, blown by the light wind. Their pace would<br/>quicken soon though. Gurei could almost feel their<br/>hatred on his back. "Calm down, boy. Shhh. We have a<br/>difficult journey to make." Gurei stroked the horse's<br/>neck as slowly and calmly as possible. Gradually, Ranma<br/>calmed down enough for Gurei to lead him out of the<br/>stable. Gurei didn't have enough time to prepare the<br/>saddle. He would have to ride bare back.<p>In his youth, Gurei would have leapt on the horse's<br/>back without hesitation. He no longer had his youth,<br/>but he was going to have to make it onto the horse<br/>quickly if he was going to have any opportunity of<br/>getting to the village in time. He closed his eyes,<br/>took a deep breath and jumped.<p>Miraculously he made it onto Ranma's back. Whereupon<br/>the horse ran off in the direction of the village<br/>without any direction from Gurei. The Amazons trained<br/>him well.<p>Gurei held tight to Ranma's body as he galloped<br/>through the darkening woods. It would be so easy to<br/>slip, to fall, to be injured and not be able warn<br/>them. Each beat of hoof against ground was a<br/>challenge against Gurei's balance, strength and<br/>stamina. After ten minutes, nearly all three of those<br/>had been depleted.<p>Gurei wasn't aware that he was crying until he felt<br/>the wind blow against the tracks of tears on his face.<br/>He was thinking of his few friends in the village, of<br/>the Saotomes, of the other cursed Nerimans, of his<br/>wife and daughter. They were the only ones he cared<br/>about...and except for Mei, his wife, they all had<br/>Jusenkyo curses. Not one of them would escape<br/>unharmed, and it was very likely...they would all die.<br/>But... he had to warn the village. He had to find his<br/>family. He had to try.<p>An eternity and five minutes later Ranma galloped<br/>to the front gate of Nyuuchezutswun. The two Amazon guards<br/>crossed their halberds in front of him. "What is<br/>your business, Guide."<p>"JUSENKYO!" The guide gasped. "THE WARDS...<br/>FALLEN!"<p>Eyes widened, the guards parted to let him pass<br/>without another word. The one on the right ran to<br/>the watchtower that stood some ten meters down the<br/>wooden palisade.<p>Soon there was a low dirge emanating from the tower<br/>that shook Gurei's insides. Shortly afterward, it was<br/>answered by another and then a third and forth. It<br/>seemed almost as though the ground itself were<br/>shaking. Gurei nodded. The alarm had been raised. Now<br/>he had to find his family.<p>Gurei rested just a moment more, steeling himself<br/>against the mounting fatigue and pain, before<br/>galloping through the village paths past small shacks<br/>and huts, to his family's home. It was a modest shack,<br/>built from mud and small trees from the forest. Its<br/>roof was thatched from the long sturdy grasses of the<br/>meadow west of the village, and jutting out of it was<br/>a chimney made of the stones from the mountains.<br/>Looking at his home away from Jusenkyo, Gurei felt<br/>the weight of what was happening hit him with greater<br/>force. Here was everything that was good about the<br/>Amazons. Everything important that they had<br/>accomplished was summed up in this fragile edifice.<p>It all amounted to nothing.<p>Any one of the escaped spirits could obliterate it<br/>with a thought once they found a host...and there<br/>were plenty viable hosts in Nyuuchezutswun. At least one<br/>in every twenty villagers bore curses from Jusenkyo.<p>For all their knowledge, for all their prowess in<br/>martial arts, the Amazons were weak. The rest of the<br/>world progressed while the "great" Amazon nation<br/>stagnated, led by antiquated old fools who behaved<br/>like children — spoiled brats with dangerous toys.<p>Gurei shivered as a sharp breeze cut through his<br/>damp clothing. He almost dismounted, the need to see<br/>his family pressing on him greatly, but he stopped<br/>himself. No inviting smoke issued from the chimney.<br/>The square window below the roof was dark. The house<br/>was empty. A husk.<p>For a crazed moment, Gurei wished that he himself<br/>had the power to blow the building away into rubble.<br/>The only importance the shack ever held for him was<br/>its promise of holding his wife and daughter, and it<br/>had broken that promise...just as the Amazons had<br/>done countless times. But it wasn't the house or even<br/>the Amazons that deserved his rage. The spirits of<br/>Jusenkyo had always been held in a secure vault of<br/>evils. They were LET out, Gurei was sure of it. He<br/>did not know who had played Pandora, and he did not<br/>know where his family was, but he knew that this<br/>information, and probably the culprit herself, would<br/>be found among the Elders.<p>The Jusenkyo guide wasn't as young as he once was.<br/>He was out of shape, and in pain from all that he had<br/>done in such a small time, but somehow he would find<br/>his family, and make the one responsible pay for her<br/>crimes. A rational voice within Gurei told him this<br/>was impossible—a foolish dream, but he paid it no<br/>mind. Driven more by hate now than duty or even love,<br/>Gurei turned Ranma around and rode deeper into<br/>Nyuuchezutswun, toward the House of Elders.<p>The village was already a bedlam of activity. People<br/>were boarding up windows and sticking plugs in their<br/>chimneys even as they shivered in the growing cold.<br/>Some families even started to dig ditches around<br/>their homes to fill with rain water. While normal<br/>water could not hurt the spirits, it did make them<br/>sluggish if it was in contact with their hosts.<br/>Meanwhile many of the warriors passed out vials of<br/>purified Jusenkyo water to the villagers swarming<br/>around them. This water could actually hurt the<br/>spirits, and if it splashed one of the chakras of the<br/>host's body (the top of the head, the forehead, the<br/>neck heart, stomach, or groin), it could drive the<br/>spirit out for a time. It was the best defense the<br/>villagers had. Unfortunately, it appeared the warriors<br/>were only giving vials out<br/>to the women.<p>Rage once again welled up in the Guide as he<br/>witnessed this pettiness in the face of disaster, but<br/>there was nothing he could do. Grimacing, Gurei<br/>looked forward and guided Ranma through the chaos as<br/>quickly as possible. The way was clear again for a<br/>while until he reached the House of Elders. Here in<br/>the inconstant light of torches and small bonfires<br/>warriors and healers were placating the villagers who,<br/>like Gurei himself, wanted to get inside.<p>Using his position on horseback to plow slowly<br/>through the crowd, Gurei reached the main entrance of<br/>the House of Elders. The building was very large to<br/>be made without machines. The front entrance was<br/>a stone archway that led to the main hall of the<br/>building. Rooms were situated along the perimeter of<br/>the hall, ten along the length, and seven along the<br/>width. The building was three stories high and each<br/>room on the upper levels opened to a balcony<br/>overlooking the hall. The Hall itself had a large<br/>fireplace on one end and a raised lectern on the<br/>other. It was possible to have nearly half the<br/>village attend a meeting in the House of Elders<br/>comfortably, and since only women were allowed to<br/>attend village meetings, this was more than enough<br/>space. four of the seven elders that ruled the<br/>Nyuuchezutswun lived in the House of Elders,<br/>along with decorated warriors, healers, and<br/>historians.<p>One of these decorated warriors stepped to the side<br/>of Ranma and brought twin halberds to Gurei's neck in<br/>a scissor action that would have been physically<br/>impossible were it not for the woman's mastery of ki.<br/>The warrior's name was Lin. Gurei knew her by reputation<br/>only. She had led the Amazons against the Musk in a minor<br/>skirmish that might have turned into a war if her<br/>victory hadn't been so complete. "How is it that a male<br/>rides such a steed?" she asked with a sneer, "And why<br/>would such a creature seek to enter the House of Elders?"<p>Gurei kept as little of his anger at Lin's arrogance<br/>from showing as he could. "I am the Jusenkyo Guide,<br/>Gurei Pu. It is my duty to convey what information I<br/>have concerning the springs to the elders. I would<br/>perform my duty now if your excellence would permit."<p>Lin released Gurei, spinning both halberds<br/>effortlessly to her side. It would be ungainly, even<br/>for one of Lin's skill to use two halberds in a<br/>serious battle. Lin's object however was to keep<br/>unskilled villagers out of the House, and for this,<br/>the ability to use both weapons simultaneously with<br/>such ease was an impressive deterrent. "I recognize<br/>your position, Guide, but you cannot speak with the<br/>elders at this time." Lin's eyes were fierce in the<br/>torchlight.<p>"It's important that I speak with one of them! Why<br/>do you deny me this?" Even though it was considered<br/>uncouth for a man to talk back to a woman,<br/>particularly one of Lin's stature, it was also true,<br/>Gurei found, that if he acted as if he expected<br/>respect, then he was more likely to receive it.<p>The proud Amazon murmured, her lips barely moving, "I<br/>do not deny you anything...but you cannot speak<br/>with the elders." Lin's eyes wavered just a fraction.<p>Gurei nodded. Lin was putting on a show. There was<br/>something going on, and Gurei was too visible for the<br/>woman to be candid with him. Gurei pushed back<br/>through the crowd and guided Ranma to the shadows of<br/>the side of the building. Unbeknownst to most of the<br/>villagers, the House of Elders had several secret<br/>entrances, one of which was close to where Gurei was<br/>now. Sliding off Ranma, Gurei staggered in the dark<br/>until he found a ring of stones that in better light<br/>would appear to be site for a bonfire. Moving the<br/>west-most stone out of the ring however revealed a<br/>handle. Gurei pulled up on this and the entire ring<br/>lifted, revealing a passageway underneath. Gurei,<br/>alternately sore and numb from his ride through the<br/>cold night in wet clothing, carefully climbed down<br/>the wooden rungs of the ladder embedded in the wall.<br/>When he reached the floor he heard the sound of a<br/>blade being unsheathed and directly afterwards felt<br/>the cool shock of metal against his throat.<p>"State your name, intruder."<p>"Gurei Pu, Guide of Jusenkyo. I need to give the<br/>elders information but I was told they could not<br/>speak with me."<p>Gurei heard the guard sigh as the blade left his<br/>neck. She lit her torch allowing Gurei to see her<br/>face. Moisture gleamed in twin tracks down her cheeks.<br/>She looked down at her feet. "It's true, they cannot<br/>speak with you," her head rose and her eyes met<br/>Gurei's, "they're all dead."<p>Gurei eyes widened in shock "No. It can't be! The<br/>spirits cannot have traveled so quickly!"<p>The young guard shook her head. "I'm a healer, I'm supposed<br/>to be able to prevent death...but...they didn't just<br/>die, they...The entire hall is covered in blood!"<p>Gurei had always suspected, but this proved it. The<br/>Elders had been drinking Jusenkyo water to stay alive.<br/>Even as they continued to age and shrivel, as long as<br/>they drank the ki infused waters of the cursed<br/>springs, they would maintain their health. Physical<br/>attacks, even the emotion-based attacks of chi would<br/>not affect them anymore than usual. But the spirits<br/>attacked using ki, soul energy. Someone in the House<br/>had to have been cursed and when they attacked the<br/>elders must have been so saturated with ki that even<br/>the slightest influx of the energy blew them apart.<br/>"The spirit is still in the room?"<p>"Yes. The walls of the House are protected against<br/>spirits; so those that escaped decided to lock the<br/>door and see if what was supposed to keep a spirit<br/>out, would keep it in."<p>"What did you see?"<p>"I...it was just the standard weekly meeting at<br/>first. Then Elder Pao Da... She got up in front of<br/>everyone and started yelling that we were becoming<br/>weak, that we needed to gain more power. She talked<br/>about Sister Shan Pu and how she was the best of the<br/>new generation and was defeated by a mere male..."<p>Pao had always been the strongest speaker against<br/>equality of the sexes. In fact, she normally seemed<br/>adverse to discussion of any change at all in the<br/>traditional system. That she would do such a thing<br/>was not completely unnatural, but still shocking.<br/>"She couldn't have been serious. Ranma defeated even<br/>Sa Furan!"<p>"Yes and the council had decided shortly afterwards<br/>that Ranma was to be considered female, despite being<br/>born male. Elder Pao Da must have gone insane. She<br/>started speaking in some strange language, and then<br/>there was this white owl that she brought out of a<br/>wooden cage that she..."<p>"Wait, an owl?"<p>"Yes."<p>"I see." Gurei had still been thinking that somehow<br/>one of the elders had gotten cursed. This was worse.<p>"What is it?"<p>Gurei took a breath."The owl is her familiar. Pao<br/>is now a witch." Gurei grabbed the young healer's<br/>shoulders. "You must listen to me. She is not of the<br/>walking dead, she can leave that building whenever<br/>she wishes, which means she has been preparing<br/>something. You have to find someone to help you...Lin<br/>maybe. Find the owl. This is what you must attack.<br/>The owl is Pao's link to the spirit of Kyounichuan.<p>"Sha Resu... Remember that name.<p>"Sha had been one of the leaders of the uprising<br/>against the sorcerers one thousand, seven hundred<br/>fifty years ago. He was captured and tortured, but he<br/>would not reveal the names of his comrades. For his<br/>punishment he was turned into an owl. He drowned<br/>himself in Jusenkyo, exchanging his soul for the<br/>opportunity to crush the sorcerers. He succeeded. His<br/>spirit was then imprisoned in the waters of Jusenkyo,<br/>his will corrupted over the ages until he found no<br/>fault in killing thousands.<p>"He will use illusion and trickery. Remind him of<br/>his past. That may distract him long enough for you<br/>to kill the owl. Use wood or something else once<br/>living to pierce the creature's heart. Pao will die<br/>as well once you do this." Gurei released the healer<br/>and turned back toward the wooden ladder.<p>"You are leaving?"<p>"Yes. I must find my family." Gurei spoke without<br/>turning around.<p>"Oh! By the Goddess! I thought you knew!"<p>"What?" Gurei asked still looking ahead. He had the<br/>feeling the coming news would not be pleasant.<p>"Your wife and daughter, they moved into Elder Ko<br/>Lon's house for the fall!"<p>Gurei was silent for a moment. "What is your name?"<br/>he asked finally, turning his head toward the healer.<p>"Li San"<p>"Thank you, Li San... I had almost lost hope." Gurei<br/>started up the ladder.<p>"But..."<p>"Remember," Gurei paused, "Sha Resu. The man-hater<br/>depends on that man." With that, Gurei climbed out of<br/>the hole, clambered onto Ranma and set off toward<br/>Elder Ko Lon's house.<p>In the woods.<p>Back toward Jusenkyo.<p>Gurei should have known his family would be there.<br/>Ko needed someone to watch her house while she was in<br/>Japan and Gurei's family had volunteered earlier that<br/>year to house-sit during the fall. They liked the<br/>house because it was more remote, quieter, and they<br/>were closer to Gurei. The guide grimaced in both pain<br/>and shame as he urged the horse to gallop faster out<br/>of the village and back into the black woods. First<br/>Pei getting cursed, now this... it seemed that<br/>Gurei's family was always punished for being near him.<p>They had gone through the wood for about a minute<br/>when, suddenly, Ranma reared up and whinnied in<br/>fright, knocking Gurei off his back. Gurei got up as<br/>quickly as possible, not wanting to get trampled by<br/>the spooked horse. His tail bone was probably cracked,<br/>and his legs were severely bruised and numb. Gurei could<br/>barely stand up, but he beckoned Ranma away from the<br/>darkness. The horse came to him, still skittish.<br/>"You've been a good horse. You've been brave, the human<br/>Ranma would be proud of you, boy. You and I both know<br/>this is where we part though, huh? You'll probably be<br/>alright. This is a good night for being a horse. Get<br/>out of here. And try not to get killed." Gurei<br/>slapped the horse on its flank and it galloped off.<p>Gurei was alone again.<p>It was dark. Pitch black. He could navigate fairly<br/>well on the feel of the path under his feet, but it<br/>was slow, painful and frightening. He could feel the<br/>spirits of Jusenkyo scrounging for their victims<br/>through the air like dogs nosing through the trash,<br/>and while he knew that he had nothing to fear from<br/>them until they found someone they had cursed, that<br/>didn't help him feel any better. He also knew that by<br/>now Pei was probably taken over. He kept going anyway.<br/>He needed to see her. Even if she wasn't herself,<br/>even if she did something terrible... he still needed<br/>to see her face...to tell her that he loved her.<p>There was a slight twinkling in the distance that<br/>gradually grew more distinct as Gurei shambled down<br/>the path. It finally revealed itself to be the window<br/>of Ko Lon's cabin. Gurei increased his speed. He was<br/>there. He had made it! When he reached the door, he<br/>paused and closed his eyes.<p>The door would be unlocked. He would open it<br/>without knocking, startling his wife and Pei. For a<br/>few seconds they would look at him in shock and then<br/>Pei would jump and run at him crying "Daddy!" He<br/>would hug her tightly with tears streaming down his<br/>cheeks. Pei would ask why he was crying and he would<br/>say "Because I missed you so much, and I was afraid<br/>something awful might have happened to you." "Aw<br/>Daddy," Pei would respond, "nothin's gonna happen to<br/>me!" Then his wife would smile and ask how his day<br/>was. "I was in a terrible dream," he'd say, "but now<br/>I'm awake." Then he'd hug them both. "I love you<br/>both so very much..."<p>Gurei opened his eyes. He opened the door...<p>The first thing he saw was blood. Huge streaks of<br/>it, splashed haphazardly on the wall across from the<br/>door like a madman's first attempt at modern art. The<br/>light in the window came from oil lamps on stands on<br/>either side of the door. Their flames flickered<br/>frenetically, changing shadows into nightmares. Gurei<br/>cautiously walked to the living room to his left. His<br/>foot slipped backwards and he looked down. There was<br/>a path of blood on the floor.<p>Gurei swallowed.<p>He entered the living room.<p>He heard a squishing sound to his right and turned.<br/>There he saw his wife. Or rather... what used to be<br/>his wife. The body had only one eye that lolled<br/>around in its socket erratically. The head was tilted<br/>at an awkward angle, further opening a large gash on<br/>the side of the neck. The body shuffled on its feet<br/>toward Gurei reaching out and snatching in the air in<br/>front of it. It wore the tatters of a cheongsam. It<br/>dragged a bloody, unraveled loop of intestine that<br/>hung from the gaping red hole in the body's torso.<br/>Gurei was too late. Far too late. He stood in shock<br/>watching the horror creep closer to him.<p>"She's beautiful, isn't she?"<p>Gurei whirled around to find his daughter, still so<br/>small, now covered in blood, her eyes glowing a<br/>wicked blue, fangs protruding from her lips. "Why?"<br/>Gurei asked the vampire as tears began to fall down<br/>his cheeks. "All you needed was her ki. Why did you<br/>do this to her?"<p>The waist-high girl with the double pigtails scowled,<br/>her eyes flashing purple. "She deserved it!" The<br/>vampire in Pei's body raised a tiny hand. "I don't<br/>need to explain myself to you, Guide." Thin glowing<br/>filaments grew from each finger slowly as Gurei<br/>stared. She made a fist. Gurei saw four of the<br/>filaments whip toward him and suddenly his world<br/>exploded in white hot pain. He felt himself falling.<br/>His head hit the floor. Even through the intense<br/>pain he tried to get up out of instinct, only to find<br/>that he could not. He no longer had the arms and legs<br/>with which to do so. It happened so quickly. The<br/>spirit was so powerful. How could anyone hope to<br/>defeat an army of them? "Your immunity to ki draining<br/>is an irritation, but no matter," Pei's child voice<br/>spoke in horrible mocking tones, "You will simply<br/>become food for your dead wife. Isn't that touching?<br/>I think I might even watch for a bit before I visit<br/>Japan."<p>All Gurei could see was the wood ceiling of the<br/>cabin and the darkening colors around his vision<br/>obscured even that. He could feel his consciousness<br/>slipping away. "Pei..." He said with a shudder of<br/>breath. "Pei, if you can hear me...please know that I<br/>love you. I've always loved you. I'm sorry we could<br/>not be together more. I'm sorry I wasn't a better<br/>father."<p>"SHUT UP!" The vampire yelled. "Your daughter is<br/>dead. You can save your sappy apology for the<br/>afterlife."<p>In spite of the situation, in spite of the pain, in<br/>spite of everything, Gurei smiled. Pei had heard him.<br/>At least that one good thing had happened this night.<br/>It was small, but Gurei had always been an optimist.<br/>Maybe the information he had given Li would allow her<br/>and Lin to defeat Pao. Maybe somehow the others would<br/>survive. And maybe, when it was all over the Amazon<br/>nation would be reborn as one based on equality and<br/>not brutality. Even through the miasma of hate Gurei<br/>had reached his daughter. That was enough for him to<br/>believe that humanity had a future...that there was hope.<p>"Tell me one thing, Feng Lili..." Gurei could sense the<br/>vampire pause in shock at hearing her mortal name.<br/>"Was it worth it?" Silence was the vampire's only<br/>response. Gurei asked again. "Was all this... worth<br/>selling your soul?"<p>Gurei was dimly aware of something slicing through<br/>his neck. "Fuck you," he heard the vampire say.<p>Gurei died smiling.<p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~<p>C&amp;C welcome.<p>My other fanfics may be found here:
