</div>Kyuuketsuki<br/>Chapter 3(counting prologue):The House of Elders<br/>By Zorknot<p>DISCLAIMER: Ranma1/2 owned by Takahashi Rumiko and<br/>various other companies.<p>NOTE: All previous chapters can be found at<p>or at<p>The website is primitive, but functional.<p>Nyuuchezutswun is the name of the Amazon village.<p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~<p>The darkness was profound. Even with the torch still burning in the<br/>passageway, the inky depths of night curled around Li San, making<br/>her feel naked, cold, and alone.<p>Gurei had left.<p>He had gone to certain death and he had smiled at her in thanks at<br/>the chance to do so. He was not a woman, not a warrior, not really<br/>anything in the Amazon way of thinking. Li San herself had not a<br/>week hence joined her sisters in laughter at the way he tottered<br/>about with his bulbous features and rotund physique. And yet...<p>Li San tried to pull herself together, tried to squelch the twin<br/>streams of moisture that rolled down her face. Again there was the<br/>ever present doubt she had...that she wasn't meant to be a Healer, a<br/>Warrior. The sight of blood still made her squeamish, cries of pain<br/>drove needles in her spine, yet she was expected to kill as much as<br/>save those who were her patients.<p>Magic made curable many things that stymied science, but it was a<br/>double edged sword. The demon god that languished in the source<br/>of the Jusenkyo springs fed magic not only to its waters but to the<br/>creatures that drank of them. Even common animals could inflict<br/>terrible curses upon their enemies, and those humans that<br/>campaigned against the Amazons could unleash punishments many<br/>times more insidious.<p>Possession was nigh incurable after only few days and often those<br/>who may once have been friends were twisted into perverse<br/>creatures of monstrous strength. Cancer, by comparison, was at the<br/>level of a common cold.<p>The vampires of Jusenkyo were not the only evil in the world, but<br/>if possession was a disease, then they were an epidemic. An<br/>epidemic for which there was only one remedy... Death.<p>This really wasn't any different from any other task she had been<br/>given. She had the means for a cure, and now she had to administer<br/>it.<p>Pao Da was a witch. As things looked she was the one most likely<br/>responsible for the failing of the wards of Jusenkyo. The only way<br/>to defeat her was through her familiar. An owl. Sha Resu. She had<br/>to remind him of his old life, and then she had to kill him.<p>If she didn't do this the Amazon's only true defense against the<br/>vampires would be closed to them, and not only would they likely<br/>perish, but they would become an army of revenants that would<br/>bring death to all.<p>Li San was an Amazon. She could not cry. She could not be weak<br/>now when she was needed by her people. She could not allow a<br/>man to show more courage and nobility than herself. She was a<br/>secret believer in male suffrage, a belief strengthened by what she<br/>had learned tonight, but she also had her pride as an Amazon, and<br/>it was this that granted her the strength to wipe the moisture from<br/>her eyes, extinguish the flame of her torch, and grab the wooden<br/>rungs of the ladder to the outside world.<p>Li San climbed out of the dark hole she had been stationed in and<br/>analyzed the situation at the main entrance.<p>The villagers were getting more and more frantic. Their torches<br/>rose up and down in anger. Weeping fathers begged that their<br/>children at least be allowed inside, raising them up almost as if in<br/>offering. All of them were trying to get in, and only Lin was<br/>keeping them at bay.<p>Li San couldn't just go in herself. She had seen what had become<br/>of the elders, and she knew that without some aid she would perish<br/>as well. But the other warriors of the House were either already<br/>dead, distributing cleansed Jusenkyo water, guarding the other<br/>entrances, or trying to get inside themselves. She had to contact<br/>them somehow, but how could she do this without revealing what<br/>terror was going on inside the House of Elders, the very center of<br/>everything that Amazons stood for?<p>How could she find aid, without causing total panic?<p>Seeing the mobs of screaming villagers so tenuously kept at bay,<br/>seeing how violence was a secret undercurrent that threatened to<br/>reveal itself at any moment, Li San decided that total panic was<br/>inevitable. The House had to be cleared.<p>Li San was not an imposing figure. She was small, only some<br/>fourteen hands high, and her frame was slight. She was athletic<br/>more than strong, and most of the time her small stature was a<br/>strength rather than a weakness. But right now she wished she was<br/>massive as a village guard, twenty-four hands high with gigantic<br/>rippling muscles and a wide, domineering stance. Even if she was<br/>as big as a house, though she doubted she'd make it through that<br/>crowd. There was no easy way to do this, but she had a way.<p>Li San closed her eyes and silently thanked the Goddess for her<br/>training.<p>She concentrated and breathed in deeply, moving her ki outside of<br/>herself, and into the crowd, halfway between where she stood in<br/>darkness and the step where Lin brandished her halberds in an<br/>attempt to keep those that got through the four other guards from<br/>passing. Now she used her second sight to see herself, not only<br/>visually but thermally and with sound as well, then she stretched<br/>her ki into a long strand between the two locations and "arced" her<br/>image across the ki strand to the step.<p>There was gasping as those in the front seemed to see someone<br/>materialize out of thin air.<p>Good. It worked. A bead of sweat trickled down Li San's brow.<br/>Elder Ko Lon could perform the "Splitting Cat Hairs" technique<br/>without difficulty, but it was never meant to be used over such<br/>large distances, and while Li San was skilled, she lacked the vast<br/>experience of an elder. She would have to be quick or she would<br/>risk losing concentration altogether.<p>"Lin, we must assemble a team to destroy Pao Da." Li San spoke<br/>knowing her words were repeated by the image. She could not hear<br/>what Lin might be saying though, she had to trust that she was<br/>understood. "The guide has given me information that will help us,<br/>but I require aid." The image flickered as Li San gasped for air.<br/>She was shaking from the stress. "Please...let...me...through." She<br/>managed before her ki snapped back into her and she staggered,<br/>panting, as colored lights played across her vision. Swallowing she<br/>took a few moments to recover and then straightened herself. She<br/>felt lightheaded and sick to her stomach, but she blinked these<br/>sensations away and concentrated on the crowd in front of her.<p>When ki passes through the body it produces a giddy or uneasy,<br/>shuddery feeling in even those insensitive to psychic phenomena.<br/>When the ki passed through the crowd then it made an aisle way<br/>through the people as they almost unconsciously moved away from<br/>the sensation. Li San could get through, but she had to be quick.<p>Taking one last breath she broke into a sprint and headed for the<br/>almost indistinguishable crack in the mob. She dodged and weaved,<br/>and as the aisle way closed she eventually had to use her nearly<br/>depleted ki reserves to jump over people. As she reached the front<br/>though, people started backing away for her, recognizing her status<br/>as a healer and as someone who had something important to say.<p>The two guards closest to her nodded, and she stepped on to the<br/>veranda of the House of Elders. The battle had not yet begun and<br/>already she was out of breath and faint. Li San had youth, but for<br/>an Amazon youth held little virtue, only skill. She had lived her<br/>seventeen years in a time of relative peace and she felt it now. Lin,<br/>entering her thirtieth year, held such power in her body it could be<br/>smelled. Like the crispness of ozone. There was such difference in<br/>their skill levels, Li San almost felt like jumping back into the<br/>crowd rather than speak to Lin. Stories of Lin were told to her as a<br/>child, shared across campfires, whispered in taverns. Lin was in<br/>fact, Li San's idol.<p>Li San greatly respected the elders. There was no idea among the<br/>Amazons that age equated frailty, and she honored them to the<br/>point of near worship, as did many others. But they were gone.<br/>Blown apart. And now there was only Lin. If anyone could bring<br/>the Amazons together and banish the vampires once again it would<br/>be Lin. Lin was their only hope.<p>Li San kneeled deeply in front of her heroine and stayed in that<br/>position until she could trust herself to look up without breaking<br/>into tears once again.<p>"Stand, sister Li San. I would hear this information you bring from<br/>the Guide." Lin commanded. Her voice rang clear and true. Part of<br/>it was an act, Li San knew. Part of it was just to give an appearance<br/>of strength to the mobs surrounding them. Still, Li San took<br/>comfort in it. Lin would not let the Amazons fail.<p>Shakily, Li San stood. Once again she mustered her courage; she<br/>looked straight up into her idol's eyes. So fierce those eyes, they<br/>could challenge mountains and they would win. Li San wanted<br/>desperately to look away, but that would show weakness, and she<br/>would not do that. Not here. Not now. "Sister Lin," She began,<br/>feeling not for the first time that 'sister' was entirely unsatisfactory,<br/>however technically appropriate it might be, "there is a way to kill<br/>the witch."<p>"What's this about a witch?" One of the women in the crowd<br/>shouted.<p>"We shouldn't be worried about witches now! We have to protect<br/>our men and children from the vampires!" another woman insisted.<p>Sometimes people could be so inane in times of stress, and the<br/>worrisome thing was it was often about the things they cared most<br/>about.<p>Li San addressed not the crowd but Lin. "I need help. The House<br/>must be cleared..."<p>Lin set her jaw and waved Li San silent. She stepped toward the<br/>crowd and spoke, "People of Nyuuchezutswun! I and my fellow<br/>Guardian sisters have kept a dire secret from you, but now it must<br/>be told. The vampires have already reached this place."<p>"No!" one of the men said this time, "We should still have an hour<br/>at least!"<p>"The witch has been masquerading as elder Pao Da for some time<br/>now. Tonight after a scheduled meeting, it assassinated all of the<br/>other elders save Ko Lon, who remains in Japan."<p>A deafening murmur arose. "What will we do?" "We're crushed!"<br/>"What chance have we now?"<p>"Why have you kept this from us!" a voice demanded.<p>"I hear someone among you questioning the authority of the<br/>Guardians of the House of Elders." Lin boomed in her stormy alto<br/>voice. The crowd quieted. "You have plenty reason to doubt the<br/>House. The Elders are all dead save for two, and half of our best<br/>warriors perished with them. The witch masquerading as Elder Pao<br/>Da remains in the House, kept from the rest of the village only by<br/>virtue of the House's protection. Until now there has been no way<br/>to combat this menace. We have been keeping Guard on the House<br/>for the safety of all, to keep the witch from escaping. If you would<br/>challenge us in this, then be the first to volunteer to vanquish this<br/>beast."<p>A well muscled woman with black hair and a scar through the left<br/>eye pushed up through the crowd. "I will volunteer! I still have<br/>courage and honor, even if those of the honored House of Elders<br/>lack both!" She spat on the ground.<p>Lin actually smiled. "Well met, sister Buri Lo. I see that you do<br/>indeed posses courage and honor...but have you intelligence and<br/>patience? Tell me, Buri, how you expect to vanquish this witch<br/>once inside." The smile left Lin's lips and her features turned<br/>painfully sour, "This fiend that has reduced our elders to puddles<br/>on the floor, that has left some of our strongest warriors, our sisters,<br/>as nothing more than twisted bones and flesh."<p>Buri Lo simply glared stonily at Lin, apparently unable to offer any<br/>suggestions.<p>"Let me tell you what you will be facing, my sisters. Arcs of white<br/>hot energy, cutting through anything in its path as easily as if<br/>nothing were there. Powerful blasts of ki that need only come near<br/>you to rend you free of all thought, and if they should reach you,<br/>cause instantaneous death. The hag is fast and cunning and can<br/>dodge any attack. It has the mind of an elder at its command. And<br/>who knows what powers this witch may possess that I haven't<br/>been witness to. We made every attempt to vanquish the nightmare,<br/>but death is not a price to be paid lightly. When we saw that none<br/>would survive if we persisted, we fled."<p>"But now we are faced with death from the springs as well!" This<br/>was from a man, holding a small child, scarcely more than a baby,<br/>with one arm. "If we can't enter the House for our protection, how<br/>will we survive?"<p>"We would not, were it not for the aid of the Jusenkyo Guide. He<br/>has given us a way to defeat the witch." Lin replied.<p>Buri spat again, "The Jusenkyo Guide is a man. Not even a warrior<br/>that one."<p>Li San had been a silent witness to all this, marveling at how<br/>masterfully Lin was handling these tough questions, but to hear the<br/>Jusenkyo Guide dismissed as nothing...she started speaking before<br/>she realized. "The Guide may be a man, but he has a woman's<br/>heart! He is as noble as any warrior, and braver than many here. As<br/>I speak he travels into the woods, to elder Ko Lon's cabin, to try to<br/>save his family from certain death. If there are any who doubt the<br/>veracity of my words, travel there and see for yourself!"<p>"We are not fools who would do such a thing," spoke one of the<br/>guards, a tall, willowy Amazon with unnaturally white hair and a<br/>somber expression on a youthful, elven face. "but what<br/>information could the man Gurei offer that could be of any use<br/>here?" Li San recognized her as Bura Shu, a healer like herself but<br/>of much greater experience. She was around Lin's age and the two<br/>often worked as a team. Li San was a healer due only to her<br/>unwillingness to cause pain. She often looked at Bura as someone<br/>to surpass as opposed to someone to admire, but she held a large<br/>measure of respect for her as well.<p>Li San could feel the eyes of hundreds burning into her and she felt<br/>the doubts start to creep in. What if the Guide's plan didn't work?<br/>Whoever entered the House would die, and it would be her fault.<br/>What if she got part of it wrong? What if no one believed her?<br/>What if they attacked her outright? Li San gulped, closed her eyes<br/>and focused. This was a small thing. This was a recounting of<br/>information. She could do this. After she was done, it would be out<br/>of her hands, and she could move on to helping out the wounded in<br/>the upcoming battle. She just had to concentrate on the particulars.<br/>"The witch...has a weakness." She began. Still she felt the<br/>expectations like an electric charge, her throat went dry. She<br/>swallowed again. "It has a familiar. An owl. This owl...It has<br/>within it one of the vampiric spirits of Jusenkyo."<p>"That hardly sounds like a weakness!" Someone shouted from the<br/>crowd.<p>Li San closed her eyes took in a breath, opened them and<br/>continued. "Its name is Sha Resu. Long ago when the magicians<br/>ruled the lands he led an uprising against them. He was caught and<br/>when he would not reveal the names of his comrades he was turned<br/>into an owl. He sacrificed his soul to help destroy the magicians'<br/>rule, but now he has been perverted by the demon god of<br/>Jusenkyo."<p>"We face death on two fronts and all you can offer us is stories?"<br/>An outraged voice asked.<p>Li San's eyes started burning. A lump grew in her throat. She<br/>could not cry though. Not here, not now. Once she had revealed<br/>what she knew she could cry. Then she could be weak. Now was<br/>the time for strength. "If one can remind Sha Resu of his past, he'll<br/>be distracted, then the owl will be vulnerable...kill it, and the<br/>witch's power dies as well."<p>"How sure are you that this plan of the Guide's will work?" asked<br/>Bura Shu.<p>"I...I don't know!" Li San could think of no other response. She<br/>wanted out of this burning furnace of eyes and back in the darkness<br/>of solitude, where she could be alone with her fears. With her tears.<p>"You don't know? You would risk lives on a mere suspicion? Do<br/>you realize what we face?" a voice challenged.<p>"This is a fool's plan!" someone else called out.<p>Li San had failed. No one would volunteer for this. She hadn't<br/>thought it out. She hadn't figured the witch's raw power into<br/>account. She had panicked everyone for nothing. She wasn't fit for<br/>all this. She was a fool. "You're right," she whispered. "You're<br/>right," she said louder. "It was wrong of me to ask for volunteers<br/>for this." Li San turned her back on the people. "Lin, please open<br/>the doors. I will go myself."<p>Lin put a strong hand on Li San's shoulder. "You will not be going<br/>without me, my sister."<p>Li San looked up in wonderment at Lin's strong warrior features,<br/>at the grim yet somehow warm smile. In this terrible night of death<br/>and suffering, here was a moment she would treasure forever. All<br/>she could do in response was nod.<p>Lin turned to the crowd. "Will any follow us on this fool's plan?<br/>We may all die this night; who among you will die with honor?"<br/>There was murmuring within the crowd.<p>Buri Lo spoke up. "My words were not empty. I will go anywhere<br/>I might shed demon blood." She went up all four steps of the<br/>veranda in a single stride and unsheathed her massive twelve-hand<br/>sword from her back. The sword was almost as large as Li San<br/>herself, but Buri held it easily using only one arm. She spun it<br/>around in a figure eight pattern once before resting it on her<br/>shoulder.<p>"I offer my services as well." Bura Shu said bowing her head of<br/>long white hair before gracefully climbing the steps herself.<p>Lin nodded and said. "This is enough. We need speed and<br/>maneuverability more than numbers. Protect yourselves against the<br/>vampires. If we do not return in an hour's time you must consider<br/>the House lost. May the Goddess protect us all."<p>Just as Lin was about to open the door, Li San suddenly<br/>remembered something. "The Guide...he said something else. He<br/>said that the witch was not one of the walking dead...that she could<br/>leave the House at any time..."<p>"Huh?" asked Buri.<p>Bura Shu just nodded. "No doubt it has been raising an army all<br/>this time."<p>"Zombies" Lin grimaced, tightening the grip on her halberd.<p>"Let me go first then," Buri requested, "it's time the undead<br/>learned to stay dead." With that Buri opened the door and they all<br/>entered, Li San closing the door behind them...<p>...into darkness.<p>Absolute darkness.<p>But there were sounds. Shuffling, scraping...moaning.<p>"Bura! Can you give us some light?" Lin hissed.<p>Slowly a white light brightened around Bura Shu. Li San looked<br/>around. And suddenly she was staring straight into the face of her<br/>mother. Rotten, disfigured, gaunt and reaching for her... Li San<br/>screamed.<p>Buri pushed her down and swung at the creature, decapitating it. It<br/>still walked, guided by some infernal mechanism. Buri picked Li<br/>San up by her collar, "Find your owl, girl, and get out of my way!"<br/>Li San nodded, eyes wide and left Buri, looking back only once to<br/>see her split the creature that was once her mother lengthwise in<br/>the dim half light provided by Bura Shu.<p>Her mother was dead. She knew it before of course but before<br/>there was still hope that somehow she might have found a way<br/>out... There wasn't time for mourning when Li San escaped, and<br/>there wasn't time now. She reached at her belt for her own weapon,<br/>a pair of nunchaku made of iron and coated with a thin layer of<br/>silver. They had a dense diamond pattern etched in the middle of<br/>each small rod to provide a grip, and the chain that held the rods<br/>together swiveled at the junctions to allow for more movement.<br/>Nunchaku were effective weapons, particularly against opponents<br/>who favored blades, and they also allowed a knock out without<br/>serious injury if such an outcome was desired. They were not<br/>however, the best weapons with which to battle zombies.<p>One grabbed her by the ankle, the skin, dry, cold. Not as startled<br/>this time, Li San had the presence of mind to know better than to<br/>merely flail at it with the nunchaku. Instead, she wrapped the chain<br/>of the weapon around the wrist of the creature and twisted<br/>forcefully, breaking the arm with a sickening crunch. Still the hand<br/>held fast to her ankle and pressed harder. Li San tried pulling it off<br/>with her fingers, but the zombie's hand wouldn't budge. It<br/>squeezed harder, causing Li San to gasp in pain. Not knowing what<br/>else to do she concentrated healing ki into her hand and touched<br/>her ankle to keep the damage to a minimum. Amazingly the hand<br/>disintegrated!<p>"Bura Shu!" Li San yelled, "heal the zombies! It kills them!" She<br/>stood up and turned around to see if Bura had heard her, only to<br/>have her face come inches away from the blade of Lin's halberd.<p>"Duck." Lin commanded and Li San obeyed. She looked behind<br/>her to see the head of another former Amazon fall. She knew it was<br/>still alive.<p>Li's weapons were largely ceremonial, silver being the traditional<br/>metal of the healer. But silver was also an excellent conductor of ki.<br/>Li San looked at her nunchaku and, concentrating, covered it with<br/>her healing ki. Then she swung at the zombie towering over in an<br/>upwards diagonal strike as she stood up. The nunchaku ripped<br/>right through the torso and the zombie's body was reduced to<br/>halves twitching on the ground.<p>"Where is the witch?" Lin growled behind Li San. She stabbed a<br/>zombie in the torso and pitch forked it over her head where it<br/>landed in Bura's grasp, promptly turning to dust from her ki. Lin<br/>and Bura stepped to either side of Li San, and the three formed a<br/>defensive triangle in the clearing they had created.<p>"Where is Buri Lo?" Li San asked in return.<p>"Arrgh! Independent wench! She's either killing zombies two at a<br/>time or she's dead!" Lin replied.<p>"The witch is most likely in the main hall," Bura surmised, "These<br/>zombies are her army, and she wouldn't want to risk destroying<br/>them to attack an intruder."<p>"So we're safe as long as were surrounded by undead?" Lin asked<br/>sardonically.<p>"No...I suspect things are going to get quite a bit more<br/>complicated" Bura replied.<p>Just then there was a tremendous cackling and a patina of blue fire<br/>spread across the ceiling. For a moment the three Amazons and the<br/>zombies were still and then...the zombies rose up in the<br/>air...levitating as if held up by strings.<p>"Sweet and holy Goddess of eternity!" Lin cried out. And the<br/>zombies began their attack.<p>They spun rapidly in the air and then swooped down upon them. Li<br/>San had to use every bit of her speed to evade the first and the fists<br/>of the unholy thing ripped gouges in the floor beside her. Covering<br/>her nunchaku with healing ki, Li San swung at the zombie...but it<br/>dodged!<p>It flipped over her attack and changed directions in mid air, its foot<br/>now aimed directly for Li San's head. She barely found the time to<br/>dodge before the foot was already digging through the floorboards,<br/>splinters flying through the air. Acting quickly, Li San swung at<br/>the zombie's back. Stuck as it was in the floor, she hit it, and it was<br/>split in two from the ki. But the torso moved by itself now,<br/>spinning around at terrible speed and heading straight for Li San.<br/>Flinching, she held the nunchaku with both hands vertically out of<br/>pure instinct and by luck this caused both arms to be severed from<br/>the creature as they spun through the weapon.<p>One of the hands found its way into the skull of another zombie<br/>and it exploded through, leaving only a reddish brown mass on the<br/>neck. This very zombie was heading straight for Lin, who was<br/>engaged with another. Li San pulled another nunchaku from her<br/>belt and using two weapons at once she made two scissor motions,<br/>first up and down, then left and right, reducing the zombie to a<br/>floating half of a torso.<p>Lin dispatched her opponent similarly and turned around to see her<br/>would be attacker fall. "We're going to get killed if there's much<br/>more of this...Li San, Bura, start moving toward the main hall!<br/>Don't attack unless absolutely necessary!"<p>Li San nodded and ran down the corridor dodging zombies and<br/>swinging at anything coming toward her with her nunchaku. Using<br/>two at once felt sloppy, but it couldn't be helped. The attacks were<br/>coming from all sides, and she needed a weapon for each hand to<br/>deal with them.<p>Then suddenly there weren't any zombies. Or rather no zombies<br/>that were moving around. Blinking, Li San stopped. In the eerie<br/>blue light from the ceiling she could just make out a figure... "Buri<br/>Lo?"<p>"I thought you might be troubled by these unholy bastards so I<br/>took care of them for you."<p>"But...it was pitch black before! How did you...?"<p>The silhouette that was Buri pointed to its head...Li San<br/>remembered the scar. "You think this is decoration girl? I'd have<br/>no depth perception, be useless in a fight if I hadn't trained my ears<br/>to see for me."<p>Lin and Bura came up behind Li San, Bura offering her own light.<br/>This actually caused Buri to squint and Lin could see her face now,<br/>though the light was still quite dim. "We need to move" Lin<br/>pressed.<p>"Yes, I don't know how long these demons will stay down..."Buri<br/>nodded.<p>It was then that Li San noticed something. Disembodied, hands,<br/>feet, heads were floating...drifting up the walls so slowly as to be<br/>barely perceptible in the gloom. Suddenly Li San knew what was<br/>going to happen. "Buri, look out!" She cried, and all of the body<br/>parts zoomed toward Buri Lo.<p>It was amazing how many the sword mistress was able to deflect<br/>with such a large weapon, but finally, a hand ripped through her<br/>knee, a foot through her shoulder, and finally, another fist blasted<br/>through her heart.<p>Li San screamed and fell to her knees on the ground. Her eyes<br/>were wide and she tried to catch her breath as her heart beat<br/>against her chest. She had hardly known Buri but the pain she went<br/>through, the cruelty of her death...<p>There was a short pause that seemed stuck in eternity, and then Lin<br/>spoke. "Everyone, get to a wall, now."<p>Li San complied without question, numbly getting up and<br/>flattening her back to the wall on her right. She saw Lin follow her<br/>own order, taking the left wall and throwing down her halberd. She<br/>took two three-pointed fist daggers from her belt and equipped<br/>herself with them. An Amazon who had gone through the<br/>"Chestnuts in Fire" training could cause bloody death in seconds<br/>with such a weapon. She could also slice through arrows, bolts<br/>from crossbows, even bullets before they could reach her, provided<br/>she knew they were coming.<p>Bura, who had been fighting hand-to-hand before, took position<br/>beside Li San and equipped herself with two shield glaives. At first<br/>glance, these were nothing more than small circular shields,<br/>roughly four hands across with a conical steel bolt in the center.<br/>However the edges of the shield were razor sharp and on inside of<br/>the starfish-like grip there was a trigger that released blades a hand<br/>long from each spoke. It was an expensive weapon, but its price<br/>matched its versatility. It could be used either for defense, or as a<br/>dangerous offensive blade that could reduce enemies to ribbons. It<br/>too was powerful against ranged attacks and in desperation the<br/>wielder could throw it at an opponent, causing perhaps injury or<br/>death to the unwary. Those skilled at glaiving could even cause<br/>them to return in a boomerang fashion. Those who were masters<br/>could catch the shield glaive again without loosing a limb.<p>The shield glaive was a favorite weapon among the healers, but Li<br/>herself would never use something so deadly. She had trained in its<br/>use, as she had for most every weapon, but that only meant she<br/>could pick one up without injuring herself. She held a certain awe<br/>mixed with repulsion for it. She had so wanted to be a great<br/>warrior like Lin in her youth, but the violence just wasn't in her. In<br/>many respects she was the best healer of her generation. Li's<br/>control of ki rivaled even those of healers ten years older than her,<br/>but in martial arts she was woefully inadequate. She couldn't<br/>understand why Buri Lo, a seasoned veteran of battle, had died<br/>before her. It was unfair somehow, and Li was afraid the fates<br/>would realize their mistake and cut her thread next.<p>Shaking, she put her nunchaku back into her belt and equipped her<br/>hand shields, smaller than Bura's shield glaives and with a layer of<br/>silver on the middle stud and handle as well as around the rim. Li<br/>was often mocked for using her weapons as mere show pieces, but<br/>now she counted the extravagance among her blessings. She took a<br/>deep calming breath and looked up, just as the first onslaught of<br/>disembodied limbs came rushing toward her.<p>Her hands blurring in front of her, Li blocked the projectiles one<br/>after another, filling the metal of the hand shields with healing ki<br/>that reduced the zombie parts to dust. They came from everywhere,<br/>and they curved and twisted and corkscrewed. All through this Li<br/>San inched with Bura Shu closer and closer to the doorway of the<br/>main hall. The flak lessened and regained force, ebbed and flowed,<br/>like an eternal macabre sea of bones and sinew.<p>Only Li San wasn't here anymore, she was six years old in<br/>projectile evasion training, surrounded by ten other students, each<br/>throwing painted pebbles at her as she was forced to dance around<br/>them. "The most important thing for an Amazon," she heard her<br/>instructor say, "Is to be observant. Speed matters for nothing if its<br/>possessor is blind. Mark the location of everything near you, in the<br/>air, on the ground, behind you, above you, AND in front. Use all of<br/>your senses, not just your sight. Hear and feel the wind rushing<br/>from each object, smell and taste the air for clues that something is<br/>near, finally do not neglect your unconscious mind, it sees far more<br/>than you can."<p>"Yes, mother," Li San said and dodged and weaved and blocked a<br/>hundred body parts. Without thinking, she jumped away from the<br/>wall, into the center of the corridor. She felt the rush of air, smelled<br/>putrification, subconsciously made a route for her limbs to follow<br/>for maximum efficiency.<p>"Li San! What are you doing! Get back by the wall" Lin screamed.<p>...but Li was twelve years old. She was in her first fight with a boy.<br/>She just had her first period and as part of the ceremony she was to<br/>fight a male to prove to all her womanhood... and to keep from<br/>getting married. He was strong and talented for his age, many said<br/>it was a shame he was born male, but still he was no match for Li<br/>San. She played with him, slapping him with her palm instead of<br/>causing any real damage, milking her audience...<p>More and more body parts aimed for the easy target of Li San, but<br/>she deflected or dodged all of them. She did flips and twists and<br/>jumps and twirls, and the floor and ceiling became just two more<br/>projectiles to avoid, gravity just another force to combat against.<p>"What is she doing?" Lin asked.<p>"She's gone mad." Bura replied, absently deflecting a skull with<br/>her shield glaive.<p>..."Finish him!" Li's mother yelled from the audience and she<br/>knew she had put things off too long. The boy jumped high in the<br/>air to try a flying sidekick. Li crouched down low. She deflected<br/>the kick with her left arm as if it were nothing, and rising up she<br/>uppercut the boy in the chin, with so much momentum she did<br/>three backward flips and a mid air somersault as a follow through...<p>"We should get to the main hall while we can," Lin suggested<br/>crossing warily over to the other side of the corridor to join Bura.<br/>Hardly any zombie parts attacked her now.<p>"No. We'll be killed," Bura shook her head.<p>"That was going to be the end result anyway!"<p>"I know this. But she," Bura pointed to the blur of action that<br/>seemed to levitate off the ground in the middle of the corridor,<br/>"she still has hope. There is power in that."<p>"If there were power in hope we wouldn't need war!" Lin<br/>contested, "Still, if we die first she won't stand a chance...<br/>Goddess! She's so weak, but she shows this strength now...I don't<br/>understand it!"<p>"You always try to put labels on things, Lin. Things aren't always<br/>black or white."<p>"Maybe not always, Bura, but they are right now." Lin punched a<br/>spinning leg out of the air and slammed it into the ground,<br/>"Black..." Lin ripped the limb to shreds with the fist daggers,<br/>"...and white."<p>...Li San stood, looking at the crumpled form of the boy, smiling.<br/>She was a woman now, she had proven herself. The audience<br/>cheered, she could hear her mother's voice among them. She<br/>walked to the boy to offer a hand up to show that there was no ill<br/>will, but when the boy got up, he started crying. He was bleeding<br/>from the nose, some teeth were missing, and he was crying. "Stop<br/>it," Li commanded, but the boy just wailed louder. "Stop crying!"<br/>The tears and blood streamed down the boy's face...and a lump<br/>grew in Li San's throat. "I didn't hurt you that badly! Stop it!" Li<br/>San looked at the floor trying to blink away the tears that were<br/>forming in her own eyes. She saw something red beside her foot.<br/>The tip of the boy's tongue. The boy had his tongue between his<br/>teeth, he was trying so hard to hit Li, but then her fist came up... "I<br/>didn't do anything! Please! Stop crying, please!" and the tears<br/>were streaming from her own face now. Tears she swore never to<br/>shed. Tears that marked her in front of everyone as being weak.<br/>And now she screamed to herself as much as the boy: "STOP IT!<br/>STOP IT NOW! Stop...stop crying..." and she collapsed wailing on<br/>the ground, her words no more than incoherent blubbering.<p>That was the last battle Li San ever won.<p>Until now.<p>The amount of flying limbs had decreased steadily and now there<br/>was nothing but silence and darkness.<p>Li was six again, her ordeal with the painted rocks complete. Not a<br/>single pebble had left its mark. "How'd I do, Mommy?" she asked.<p>"Very good, Li. You'll be a powerful warrior someday," her<br/>mother said smiling approvingly the way only mothers can.<p>"Mommy, I love you" Li San said now, in the darkness standing on<br/>the dust that was all that remained of friends and family. She shed<br/>a single tear, and then fell unconscious on the floor.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>"Wake up, Li, NOW!" Lin screamed, rousting Li San from her<br/>dreams. Li smiled. She must not be awake yet she realized. The<br/>great warrior Lin would never be shaking her like that. As if she<br/>were worried about her...as if there were something dangerous<br/>coming...as if everything she knew were about to collapse around<br/>her...<p>Li San remembered.<p>She leapt to her feet...and instantly regretted it. She was sore in<br/>almost every muscle and she felt nauseated, dizzy. Recent<br/>memories flashed in her minds eye: pools of blood and twisted<br/>bone that had once been human beings, teachers, sisters...mothers...<br/>And Buri Lo.<p>Li San turned and retched uncontrollably, wishing she could purge<br/>herself of what she had seen as easily.<p>"Li, we don't have time" Bura pressed, "Look!" the older healer<br/>pointed to the ground.<p>The black dust was moving away from them, like the undertow of<br/>water before a massive wave. Li did not want to see what form a<br/>wave of the terrible powder would take. Nodding, she followed Lin<br/>and Bura as they walked the three or four horse-lengths to the<br/>doorway briskly but warily. Lin had retrieved her halberd, but Bura<br/>still wielded the shield-glaives. Li compromised, tossing her right<br/>hand-shield to the floor and pulling out a pair of nunchaku. She felt<br/>so weak though, she could barely lift the metal weapons, and her ki<br/>was so depleted she'd risk death if she tried to use it now. She had<br/>suspected it before...but now it was certain. There was simply no<br/>way she could survive this night.<p>The thought was strangely comforting, and gave her a small<br/>measure of strength. If she was going to die, she would die as a<br/>warrior. She never would have thought it possible with her<br/>sensitivity, but these dead things without souls, these creatures that<br/>felt no pain or longing, they were giving her the chance. She<br/>would die with honor, fighting alongside the great hero Lin and the<br/>renowned healer Bura Shu.<p>They reached the doorway just as a gust of wind moaned down the<br/>corridor. It picked up speed rustling Li's tattered cheongsam and<br/>almost knocking her over.<p>"Hurry!" Lin yelled over the rising roar of wind and moved to<br/>open the door.<p>"Wait!" Bura yelled back, "Stay close to me!"<p>Li San moved as close to Bura as possible and Lin did the same.<br/>Abruptly the wind stopped, and there was a glowing bubble around<br/>them.<p>"I...can't hold this for long." Bura said, straining "A minute at<br/>most. Open the door NOW."<p>Lin did as her long time partner asked. Her arm eased through the<br/>force field and pushed the heavy door open with a low creak. And<br/>then her arm wasn't there anymore.<p>A blinding blast of white light wracked against Bura's field, the<br/>awesome heat leaking through even that. Lin slowly withdrew the<br/>stump that was once her left arm. Warriors trained long and hard to<br/>combat against shock. With an adept enough healer, limbs could<br/>even be replaced provided they were reattached quickly enough.<br/>Lin did not have that option though. If she survived, she would<br/>never have a left hand again. She would be half the woman she<br/>was before.<p>Li could read this in her idol's eyes as the warrior swallowed, her<br/>face ashen. She could almost feel the loss as if it had happened to<br/>her... "Lin," Li said, even as they moved into the main hallway and<br/>the funereal powder exploded in around them, "even with one hand,<br/>you are still the best warrior of all the Joketsuzoku. Whatever<br/>happens tonight, I will mark this as one of my proudest moments,<br/>because I'm fighting beside you."<p>Lin nodded slowly, and as she took a breath she seemed to recover.<br/>"The powder might get in if it's slow enough!" Bura warned.<p>"I'm on it!" Lin called back and pushed her right hand through the<br/>barrier. "Mouko Takabisha!" She yelled and a ball of hot air<br/>slammed into the powder blowing it away from Li, Bura and<br/>herself. She quickly pulled her hand back in. Just in time too, as<br/>another ribbon of white-hot ki slammed into the barrier. "It<br/>worked!" Lin exclaimed. "Elder Ko Lon's letters were right!"<p>"I don't know...if I can withstand another blast...Does anyone see<br/>the owl?" Bura asked.<p>Li's eyes saw only colors from Pao Da's ki attack. She was having<br/>trouble seeing much of anything, much less any owl. "It's too<br/>dark!" Li yelled.<p>"I...can't do anything about that...the powder is probably...getting<br/>close again." Bura grimaced.<p>"Close your eyes everyone!" Lin yelled.<p>Li shut her eyes tight and she heard another "Mouko Takashiba!"<br/>from Lin and then, almost right on top of that a tremendous white<br/>glow and rush of heat.<p>"Gahh!" Bura gasped, and when Li San opened her eyes the shield<br/>was gone. She tried to pierce through the darkness, to detect<br/>anything in the gloom, but even though the glowing blue patina<br/>was on the walls and ceiling of the main hallway as well, she<br/>couldn't detect any trace of the owl or elder Pao Da.<p>Then she saw it. A glimmer of light in the air that quickly grew in<br/>intensity. But for a brief instant, Li could tell where it came from.<br/>The owl.<p>A fraction of a second and the light was too bright to look at<br/>directly... and it was almost on top of them.<p>Li San didn't think. There was no time to think. She only screamed<br/>the first thing that came into her head, and it was only by accident<br/>the thing she screamed was the name "SHA RESU!"<p>And then everything went black.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>There were no sounds, feelings, smells, or tastes. Only nothing.<p>And then a voice, only it was not a voice... ~You know my mortal<br/>name. You recall a past long burned away in the slow fires of time.<br/>Who are you who does such a thing?~<p>~I am Li San.~<p>~Really? There was a time, you know, when that name meant<br/>something.~<p>~I don't understand. Am I dead? What is this place?~<p>~There is tremendous power in a name. Even if someone is<br/>unaware of the meaning, they can be affected by it. I am more<br/>sensitive to its power than most, perhaps, but it is not uncommon.<br/>Just the fact that you know my name and I happen to value the<br/>meaning of yours is enough reason for me to spare you. If you had<br/>been named something else, you might already be dead.~<p>~But...my friends...~ Li felt a tremendous sadness wash over her, a<br/>sadness mixed with a tinge of anger, and finally a feeling of dark<br/>apathy.<p>~They will die. You will die too at some point. Does it really<br/>matter how?~<p>Li found herself unwillingly stymied by the question. What<br/>difference did it really make if she died now or later? Would she<br/>be more happy...less? How could she know?<p>~Let me answer the question for you, since you seem unable to<br/>answer it yourself. It doesn't matter how you die. All that matters<br/>is how you live. Have you striven to make the most out of your life<br/>at every opportunity? Have you shown courage, honor, and dignity<br/>when you could have run away, shirked responsibility, and insulted<br/>another? Have you made the most out of your life? If you<br/>have...then you need not fear death. But then why would you wish<br/>for it?~<p>Li again felt the wave of sadness and anger course through her.<br/>~You fought to defeat the oppressive wizards when you were alive,<br/>why are you using magic against us now?~<p>~Yes I helped defeat the wizards. To do that, I had to give my soul<br/>to the demon of Jusenkyo. I was given awesome magic to defeat<br/>the wizards, and when I was successful I was torn from life and<br/>placed in an all consuming flame of heat and cold and pain...I<br/>could not stand it...but I had to. After an eternity I was given<br/>release, only in the body of an owl, the very form I was cursed<br/>with by the wizards. Still, I was free from pain, I was alive! But<br/>one splash with hot water and it all went away. I was relegated to a<br/>dark corner, only able to see the life of my victim as if from far<br/>away...the pain was gone but the isolation was just as bad. I<br/>learned to push my victim toward cold water, to keep him from<br/>using an umbrella, from remembering to worry about the curse. It<br/>was only after my victim died, unable to defend himself after hot<br/>water splashed me, that I realized I had become the very thing that<br/>I hated. But after only a few moments in the hell of Jusenkyo...I<br/>knew that I didn't care. That was one thousand five hundred fifty<br/>years ago...two hundred years after I sacrificed my soul and just<br/>before the creation of Nyannichuan. My only goal since then is<br/>staying in the living world. I don't care about you or your friends.<br/>In fact, I think its only fair that you should suffer a bit before you<br/>fade off into sweet oblivion.~<p>~But, you can't mean that! You must still care...somewhere within<br/>you!~<p>~Do you know how I got cursed with the form of an owl?~<p>~You wouldn't tell your captors the names of your comrades...~<p>~Yes, someone has done well to keep the stories alive I see. All I<br/>had to do was give them a name. Just one name, and they might<br/>never have cursed me and I might not be here about to kill your<br/>friends. But I never told them anything. They kept asking who, and<br/>I kept saying that I didn't know. They tortured me, used magic to<br/>cause me pain, and finally they turned me into an owl. They were<br/>tired of asking "who"... they wanted me to ask it for awhile. I was<br/>cursed for eternity because I cared.~<p>~But you defeated the Wizards! You might not have been able to if<br/>you hadn't done that!~<p>~When I was released from Jusenkyo into the body of an owl I<br/>flew around and discovered as much as I could about the world.<br/>Do you know what I found? I found a government ten times more<br/>oppressive and ruthless than that of the wizards I had defeated! It<br/>doesn't pay to care. Not if you're immortal.~<p>~But you do care. You're so sad...~ Li realized as she said it<br/>something that she knew only on a subconscious level if at all. The<br/>sadness, the anger, the apathy...they weren't her emotions but those<br/>of Sha Resu!<p>~You're an empath? Of course! No wonder you were able to<br/>connect with me! I thought you were using a talisman or spell...~<p>~An empath?~<p>~Yes you can read the emotions of other people...You were not<br/>aware of this?~<p>Suddenly Li San's life shifted into focus. That boy...it was his pain<br/>she was feeling! And ever since then...not being able to cause<br/>pain ...actually feeling good sometimes when she lost a match...all<br/>she had attributed to weakness, was actually her greatest strength!<p>~Yes. I do care. If you can read emotions then I cannot lie to you<br/>or myself. I care, but I do what I must to continue living. To stay<br/>away from the Hell of Jusenkyo.~<p>~Then...why not help me? Maybe we can find some way to destroy<br/>the demon of Jusenkyo and you won't have to go back again!~<p>~The demon of Jusenkyo cannot be destroyed. Only changed into a<br/>different form of evil...still I think I will help you.~<p>~Why?~<p>~Because I want to use you. Because I think through you, I may be<br/>able to live again. Because Pao Da bores me with her goals of<br/>domination and can offer me only a meager existence at best. In<br/>her mind she is already dead. She has lived for hundreds of years,<br/>but has done nothing. Now she tries to make up for it, but she has<br/>no imagination. No passion. No soul. Helping you would be much<br/>more beneficial to me. You must understand, though, there will be<br/>some sacrifice on your part.~<p>~What kind of sacrifice?~<p>~I must become your familiar. I must see through your eyes, and<br/>you through mine. If you should die before the owl that holds me<br/>here, then you will take my place in Jusenkyo for all eternity.~<p>~There isn't any other way?~<p>~Yes there is. There are many ways I could help you that wouldn't<br/>require such a sacrifice. But this is moot. I will only help on this<br/>condition, and without my help you will die. Perhaps you might<br/>prefer that to what I'm offering though, and so I give you the<br/>choice.~<p>~Okay. I accept...but I have one condition of my own.~<p>~And what is that?~<p>~Your name...Sha Resu, what does it mean?~<p>Li could feel the spirit smiling, ~You really have no<br/>idea what you're getting into, do you...~<p>And suddenly, Li was scared.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>She felt herself falling and instinctually she flapped her...wings?<br/>She was an owl! There was a bright band of energy in front of her,<br/>moving inexorably toward three humanoid figures...She had<br/>switched bodies with Sha Resu.<p>Trusting to instincts that were not her own, she flew toward her<br/>human body and her friends hoping that maybe somehow she<br/>could save them... but Sha was already moving lightening quick,<br/>pushing Bura and Lin out of the way of the very attack he himself<br/>had created.<p>Sha Resu, pointed at Li. "That's it!" Sha yelled, "that's what's<br/>been attacking us! Kill it!"<p>Li San, saw Lin getting up, saw her take some throwing stars out<br/>of her belt with her free hand, and promptly turned around to fly<br/>the other way. Li San had played right into Sha Resu's hands! If<br/>she died as an owl before her human body died, she'd be trapped in<br/>Jusenkyo forever, and Sha would be free! He hadn't even lied to<br/>her. He had told the truth the whole time, but Li never realized he<br/>would do this. A metal throwing star almost hit her. Without her<br/>mother's training, Li San would have been killed instantly. As it<br/>was, her senses were so warped as an owl she almost didn't dodge<br/>it anyway.<p>Li San angled to land on one of the benches arranged in rows in the<br/>main hall. The back of the bench offered some measure of<br/>protection from Lin's attacks and she could peek out from the side<br/>to see what was going on. Looking now she saw things weren't<br/>going well.<p>Bura Shu had collapsed to the ground gasping for air. A tendril of<br/>smoky black powder drifted to the healer's prone form. The<br/>powder thickened and Bura was only able to give a short yelp of<br/>surprise before she was completely enveloped in the black stuff.<p>Li San could feel the dust entering Bura's orifices, filling her lungs,<br/>stomach, bowels...she wanted to scream but all she could do was<br/>make a strangled "Hu" sound... Then it was over.<p>Lin turned to see her partner engulfed in black death. She placed a<br/>firm hand on Sha's shoulder. "Save her," she commanded. Only Li<br/>San knew she was already dead.<p>Sha looked over in Li's direction, then at Lin, then at Bura, and<br/>finally at the center of the black mass.<p>"Do you hear me? Save her, or I'll kill you where you stand!" In a<br/>second, Lin had a fist dagger on her good hand and against the<br/>neck of Sha's stolen body.<p>Li could see Sha's eyes widen even as far away as she was and in<br/>the dark. Truly if she hadn't been an owl she would have had the<br/>same reaction. This was her idol, threatening to kill someone she<br/>thought was Li herself. If she did though, Li wouldn't be forced<br/>into Jusenkyo...but then she'd spend the rest of her days as an owl...<p>Sha slowly placed a hand on Lin's wrist to say he would save Bura.<br/>Then he raised an arm and pointed at the black mass with an index<br/>finger. "It is time for you to die, you meddlesome old hag!" And in<br/>an instant the black dust fell to the floor, leaving elder Pao Da...<br/>frightened and exposed.<p>And then a beam of white energy hit and Pao Da exploded into a<br/>wide splash of blood and tissue fragments.<p>The dust no longer covered Bura, and Lin could see what Li San<br/>already knew. Lin clenched her fist, and as Sha turned his stolen<br/>head back toward Lin the fist met sharply with the temple. "You<br/>aren't Li San." Lin said over the fallen form, and sat beside the<br/>body of Bura Shu.<p>Li could feel the darkness now. Not just from the blue patina of the<br/>walls and ceiling dissipating into nothing, but also from Lin. Li felt<br/>tired, depressed, and angry to such a great degree she knew all of it<br/>couldn't be from herself. Still she had a hard time figuring out<br/>where her feelings ended and Lin's began. Before she knew of<br/>being an empath, she would have attributed it to weakness, or<br/>perhaps an imagination that was a little TOO good. But couldn't<br/>that still be it? Could she really trust anything that Sha Resu said?<p>But Lin had to be the cause of the dark, unclean, terrible feeling Li<br/>had. Because Li wanted so much to be relieved, to cheer that the<br/>House was finally clear even despite the awful casualties. She<br/>certainly did not want to feel such tremendous guilt.<p>Li flew to her body. She had inserted herself into people's dreams<br/>enough in the past to combat possession that it was easy enough<br/>for her to return to her body. She opened her eyes and took a<br/>breath. "Lin," She said, "This is not your fault."<p>"I know its not my fault!" Lin snapped. "It was Elder Pao Da's<br/>fault. Or maybe Jusenkyo's fault. Maybe it's your fault, Li San.<br/>Maybe you've just been deceiving me all this time...But I should<br/>have seen it. I should have been able to do something..."<p>"There was nothing you could do..."<p>"You're trying to make me feel better?" Lin seethed, "If you want<br/>to make me feel better, TELL me I could have done something,<br/>TELL me I was stupid, or that I wasn't paying attention, or that I<br/>should have been less trusting...Don't you DARE tell me there was<br/>nothing I could have done...that I was helpless...that I'm still<br/>helpless." Lin was crying now and so was Li.<p>"I don't think you're helpless..." Li tried.<p>Lin features hardened into a cold mask. "You're a witch. I can't<br/>trust you anymore than I could comfortably spit out a rat."<p>The feelings of fear and isolation were decidedly Li's own. It only<br/>just now dawned on her that she was a witch. If her familiar died,<br/>maybe she could return to normal, but she would probably never<br/>be accepted back into Amazon society. Simply being a witch was a<br/>crime punishable by death, and even if somehow she convinced<br/>everyone that it was okay, and that she wasn't evil and they<br/>accepted her back...somehow she felt like she had already lost<br/>something irretrievable, that her ties to her Amazon sisters were<br/>now completely severed and that they would never be mended.<br/>"I'm sorry." Li spoke softly through her sobs. "It was the only way<br/>I knew we could be saved..."<p>Lin closed her eyes. "By the Goddess! Bura, you were right. I<br/>admit it! But why couldn't you be wrong? Why can't things be<br/>simple? Black and White...why does everything have to be gray?<br/>Why do there have to be evil elders...good witches...Why can't you<br/>be here now?" Lin opened her eyes. She crouched over Bura and<br/>lifted her dead friend's left arm into the air. Then she put Bura's<br/>hand in her mouth and held the arm up with her teeth.<p>"Lin, what are you doing?" Li San asked.<p>Lin made no sound in response. She simply used a fist-dagger to<br/>cut off Bura's arm at a certain spot on the fore arm. It was a clean<br/>cut. Amazing in itself, really. Then Lin held it by its base and<br/>placed it on the stump of her left arm. It was an almost perfect<br/>match. "Heal me." Lin commanded.<p>"I...I can't!" Li protested.<p>"Yes you can! You're a witch you can do almost anything! Hurry<br/>up before I realize what I'm doing."<p>Li San could feel such hope and not a small amount of craziness<br/>coming from Lin that she nodded. "Okay...I'll try." She placed her<br/>hands on Li's stump and Bura's arm and concentrated. Even with<br/>someone's own arm this was extremely difficult. Blood vessels had<br/>to be matched, nerve ending rejoined, muscle tissue healed in just<br/>the correct way, bone material reknitted. Each process had to be<br/>handled on its own and could take weeks, even months to complete.<br/>Only for some reason all of this was happening on its own. All Li<br/>was doing was supplying ki. It was as if...<p>It was as if the arm WANTED to join with Lin.<p>A mere five minutes after Li started, Lin was flexing Bura's hand.<br/>It was odd to see such a thin hand and wrist on such a large arm.<br/>The skin was milky white to Lin's tanned bronze.<p>To use another's organs for any purpose without the owner's<br/>express consent was of course illegal in Nyuuchezutswun. In fact, it too<br/>was punishable by death. Necromancy was simply too dangerous.<br/>The souls of the dead, even the recently so, were often ruthless in<br/>their quest for life, or a more restful death. Bring one person back<br/>to life, and there would likely be twenty sent to the grave before<br/>the reborn finished exacting vengeance for their half existence. Lin<br/>knew as well as Li San that Bura had become a part of Lin<br/>spiritually as well as physically. Maybe it would turn out alright.<br/>Then again maybe Lin would go mad from an internal power<br/>struggle and kill anyone near her out of reflex.<p>"Now you can't trust me either." Lin said. "Which means of course<br/>we're stuck with each other."<p>Li nodded and swallowed.<p>"Come, we must tell the villagers their House is safe." Lin said,<br/>standing. They both knew it wasn't their village any more. "You<br/>mind giving some light?"<p>Li made her hand glow so they could see their way out of the<br/>building. They walked steadily down the corridor they had fought<br/>so hard to get through. In no time they were at the door to the<br/>outside, and who knew what lay beyond. Li and Lin both pushed<br/>against the double doors, and when the villagers saw them there<br/>was a massive cheer.<p>"The House is clear!" Lin called out. "Elder Pao Da is dead. So are<br/>Buri Lo and Bura Shu. You sleep with their bodies tonight, but you<br/>shall at least wake up on the morrow."<p>"Is the witch destroyed?" someone asked.<p>"Are you sure it's safe?"<p>"What if the vampires use fire or try to ram down the walls?"<p>"A second barrier extends beyond the walls of the House." Lin<br/>responded. "Just be sure not to invite any vampires or curse<br/>victims inside."<p>"What about the owl? The familiar...Is it dead?"<p>At that very moment Li heard a flap of wings and felt the talons of<br/>Sha Resu's owl form puncture flesh as they wrapped around her<br/>right collar bone. She was in pain, but it was her own pain and she<br/>could deal with it.<p>~Do not think that this is over, Li,~ Sha's words came to Li San, ~I<br/>will not give up. It is only a matter of time, and I have more<br/>patience than you can possibly imagine.~<p>"It's her!"<p>"She's the witch!"<p>Li San could say nothing that would be believed. She simply<br/>walked down the steps into the crowd, which parted wide to let her<br/>through.<p>Lin paused on the veranda. "By Amazon law, we should both die. I<br/>ask though that you wait until a time of peace to exact the<br/>punishment. For now we will resign ourselves to darkness." And<br/>with that, Lin followed Li San through the crowd and into the night.<p>~Do you see? Do you see how they judge first and think later?<br/>That is the nature of human thought, And it will never be changed.<br/>Not by anything you can do.~<p>"Shut up." Li commanded her familiar. "Unless you'd like me to<br/>kill myself? Maybe you'd like to go back to your friend the<br/>demon?"<p>Only Li's own thoughts filled her mind, but she could feel the fear,<br/>the hatred, the sadness. "You shouldn't have let Bura die. You<br/>were supposed to protect both of them, that was the deal. But you<br/>wanted my body. You couldn't wait. Where was your patience<br/>then?" Fear and rage coursed through Li, but she knew now that<br/>they weren't her feelings, at least not entirely. She continued<br/>speaking with increased confidence. "I fought my way through the<br/>House of Elders; I have faced my fears and conquered them. I<br/>made a sacrifice and I upheld my word. You have done nothing but<br/>kill, and you went against our agreement. I don't have to do<br/>anything you say."<p>There was a feeling of cold calm and the owl perched on Li's<br/>shoulder nodded. ~You will though...You will.~ And with that the<br/>owl flew off into the night.<p>Li was now away from the crowd and approaching the woods,<br/>heading toward Jusenkyo. She didn't know where else to go.<br/>Several homes still had torches burning outside them and smoke<br/>coming out of their chimneys...homes that had Jusenkyo cursed<br/>inside. They would probably be gone by tomorrow.<p>A horse came running toward Li at a mad gallop, its eyes wide<br/>with fright. It was a copper colored stallion. Its coat shown in the<br/>torchlight as it passed Li. It was Ranma, Gurei's horse. Gurei<br/>hadn't made it.<p>Li dropped to her knees and the tears started coming again. She<br/>didn't try and stop them this time. She wasn't an Amazon anymore<br/>anyway. Was she weak? Was she cut out to be a warrior? Those<br/>questions seemed so inane now. So stupid. She would survive or<br/>she would die. It didn't matter. Everything she had loved was gone.<br/>Except...<p>Lin placed a strong hand on Li's shoulder. "Gurei helped us...He<br/>was a good man, I wish I had known him better. But we have to<br/>see if there's anything we can do to stop the vampires. We have to<br/>go to Jusenkyo."<p>"I wonder what Bura would have thought of that." Li got to her<br/>feet, wiping the moisture from her face.<p>Lin's face held a distant expression. "It was Bura who suggested<br/>it," she said.<p>After an uneasy silence they both just started walking. It was<br/>strange, Li noted, but somehow the thirty-year-old Lin had stopped<br/>being an idol, a woman almost twice her age, or even a warrior,<br/>and had become her friend. Perhaps it was the fear they both now<br/>held. That they would become as vile as the vampires themselves.<p>They were a witch and a necromancer, fighting against an army of<br/>vampires each ten times stronger than themselves. The odds were<br/>hardly in their favor. Still, Li San felt a little better about their<br/>chances. "Lin?" Li asked, remembering her conversation with Sha<br/>Resu.<p>"What is it?"<p>"I was just wondering...what does your name mean?"<p>"Hmm? Lin...doesn't mean anything...Well I...I suppose there's no<br/>reason not to tell you now...It's short for Lin To."<p>"Lin To?"<p>"The elders name...used to name children after English words. It's a<br/>tradition started some 300 years ago when an English woman<br/>supposedly saved the village. My parents were poor and they made<br/>clothing for a living...My name means lint. That stuff that gathers<br/>in corners and crevasses where clothing is stored. Once I found out<br/>what it meant I didn't care for it much."<p>"I don't know...I think it's kind of neat. I mean, you can't ever get<br/>rid of lint..."<p>Lin smiled sadly and nodded. "Yes...and as long as there is reason<br/>there is always hope."<p>"I don't understand."<p>"That is your name. Reason."<p>"My name means...reason?" Sha Rezu's statement made sense now.<br/>There was a time, he had said, when reason had meant something.<br/>But Sha was wrong, Li San decided. Reason still meant something,<br/>even in all this chaos. Li nodded "My mother..."<p>"Your mother was an amazing woman. I am glad to have known<br/>her."<p>Her mother had told Li many times she was destined for great<br/>things. After that fight with the boy, she had stopped believing. Li<br/>looked up at the blackness of the sky as she walked. She could<br/>already feel the hunger and pain from the spirits of Jusenkyo as<br/>they drifted free from their prisons. She would find a way to stop<br/>them. Her mother was dead now, and all she had left from her was<br/>her memories and her name. No matter what happened Li decided<br/>she would do her best to honor both.<p>~~~~~*~~~~~<p>Have you seen my cat?<br/>It turned into a bat!<br/>Have you seen my dog?<br/>It turned into a hog!<br/>Have you seen my dad?<br/>He turned into a cad!<br/>Have you seen my mommy?<br/>She turned into a zombie!<br/>Let's hold hands and pray.<br/>Now let's run away!<p>-Amazon nursery rhyme<p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~<p>Thanks to Fall-away for his comments in .irc and<br/>to everyone who gave reviews here.
