</div>*There's no way I'm going to allow this,* Akane fumed as she looked at Ranma flirting with Ryouga. Looking back at it, she realized that the bastard was always trying to break her and Ranma up, and now his true colours were showing. She should have known that his attempt with the koi rod wasn't the first thing that he had planned. How many years, how many had he been after Ranma as a lover?<p>For anyone else, missing the time of a duel would have been enough of an indication that they forfeited the match. But NOOOO! The damned lost boy followed Ranma all the way to China, and ever since he showed up and saw Akane, he had been doing his damndest to break them apart. At first she believed that it was because he was vindictive, then she thought it was because of something Ranma had done.<p>But the incident with the Koi rod had given her pause, and she started to have a few suspicions. True, Ryouga had helped to release Ranma from the spell, but she had always wondered if it was because Ranma had just come on too strong, and he wasn't expecting such a blatant reaction. Then again, it could have been an accident like he explained.<p>Of course, when Ranma was in any real trouble, Ryouga was ALWAYS there. Protecting his 'Sworn Enemy' when Ranma had lost his strength, making sure Ranma knew how to handle everything in Rhythmic Gymnastics, or just stepping in, such as the time when Ranma had been locked as a girl by Herb. For all she knew Ryouga's form of flirting was to yell battle cries and attack, and given the way Ranma was trained by his father, it was probably the only way her gender-confused fiancee knew how to interact with others.<p>Of course, there were all the times Ranma had taken the initiative in this, now obvious, flirting game the two had going on. Pretending to be Ryouga's fiancee to break him and Ukyou up, pretending to be his little sister so that hopefully Akane would go away and disappear, leaving the two of them alone in Ryouga's house, pretending to be a girl in order to get close to Ryouga. Ranma's 'disguises' were never that brilliant, so Ryouga must have known right away. It would also explain why Ranma was able to wear outfits that other girls would blush at, or want to use only in the bedroom, or how that mirror clone reacted. In fact, that mirror clone was probably more patterned after Ranma's true personality than the one he normally presented to the world.<p>Now the two were discussing going on a DATE of all things tomorrow night! With RANMA, the 'Man Among Men' as the girl! WITH HER MOTHER'S APPROVAL!<p>NO! Boy or girl, Ranma was hers. If she had to make love to the girl to prove that she was the only one that mattered then she would. She'd be the boy in their relationship, wear the pants, and Ranma could be the good little housewife. She would do it if she had to, no way was she going to allow any boys to go after her fiancee.<p>Akane fumed silently as she decided to shadow them on their date the next evening. There was no way she'd allow the pervert to tempt her fiancee, no way she'd allow Ryouga the chance to take Ranma anywhere near a love hotel, and DEFINATELY no way she'd allow the constantly lost boy to take Ranma, lose them somewhere, and have her SLEEP in his tent with him.<p>It should be HER with Ranma, no matter her form, HER with the person she loved. There was no way she'd allow them to be together for long! As far as Akane was concerned, she was the only one who was going to get near enough to Ranma to engage in some...<p>Sexual Endeavours<p>Part Three:<p>When it comes to the morning after...<p>A fan fiction based on Takahashi Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2<p>Saotome Ranma, Saotome Genma, Saotome Nodoka, Tendo Akane, Tendo Soun, Tendo Kasumi, Tendo Nabiki, Kuonji Ukyou, Hibiki Ryouga, P-chan, Shampoo, Shan Pu, Mousse, Mu Tsu, Cologne, Ku Lon, Kuno Tatewaki, Kuno Kodachi, Tofu-Sensei, and Hinako Sensei are copyright 1987, 2002 by Takahashi Rumiko.<p>Edited by Digital Civilization Multimedia Productions Group Inc.<p>Publishing rights: Japan by Shogakukan Inc. Tokyo<p>Hong Kong by Jademan (Holdings) Ltd.<p>North America by Viz Inc.<p>Written by Ichinohei Hitomi<p>Morning.<p>In that extremely nice time, when you do not have an alarm clock, or a parent forcing you out of bed, between sleep and full wakefulness, when ones mind is in neutral and not even attempting to revert to activity, Ranma's mind wandered. It was nice to wake up this way, without anyone to bother or bug him. Unusual though.<p>Stretching slightly, and then shifting herself on her futon, she smiled, not realizing that she had gone to sleep as a girl. Her mind was on that weird but somehow funny and satisfying dream that she had, where everyone treated her like a normal person. Admittedly as a girl, but a normal person all the same. Although having a sex shop disguised as a place where one went to get clothes to be a magical girl was probably because she wanted to write a background story about sex for their game.<p>Turning, she got up groggily and went to the washroom, having to use the facilities. She didn't really acknowledge what she was wearing as she did her business, given that there were times when she had gone to sleep as a girl before. It wasn't until she looked in the mirror that she realized that she was dressed in a very pretty, and sexy, baby doll nightie that was slightly see through.<p>"What the hell?" Ranma muttered to herself as she took a good look in the mirror. Not only was she wearing a nightgown, but her eyebrows were slightly neater, no stray hairs over or under the main brows. This didn't make sense, why was she dressed like this unless...<p>"Shit! It wasn't a dream!" Ranma murmured as she stared at herself slightly taken aback. Something had happened, something very weird, and she was now caught up in it. Hell, something bad MUST have happened to everyone, given RYOUGA was willing to go out on a date with her, especially with her MOTHER of all people encouraging it. If the trip they went on was any indication, then her mother was no longer thinking about a 'Man Among Men', as was her wont, but rather a 'Woman among Women!"<p>"Ok, something is wrong with everyone. They think I'm a girl, that I've always been a girl, just comfortable as a tomboy, that I'm attracted to men, and that Ryouga is my boyfriend. If things go anything like how my life normally does, and if it occurs like in some anime or manga I have, then someone is trying to take over. Just why wasn't I affected?"<p>Ranma paused at that one. If what was affecting everybody didn't affect her, then why was everyone treating what happened yesterday as normal. It could be that SHE was the one affected. No, it made too much sense the other way around. "It figures, I actually find a place where 'Magical Girls' go to get their uniforms, and now I've got to become one in order to figure out how to save my family and friends. Why do these things happen to me?"<p>No real help for it. Well if everyone thought that she was a girl, then there was no reason to disappoint them. After she was finished with her daily ablutions, it would be time to get that school uniform out of the closet. Thank goodness that she had a couple from various disguises that she had used in past. Come to think of it, she would have to get a complete change of clothes to bring to school as well. Well, at least she now had all the necessary extraneous stuff like the makeup and earrings...<p>***<p>Ryouga lay in bed staring at the ceiling.<p>It wasn't that he was sleeping indoors at the moment that bothered him. Although he was used to being outdoors most of the time, being indoors on a nice clean futon was something he did enjoy. His problem had to do with the date that evening.<p>Somehow, he had been sent into another dimension. It could be his family curse of getting lost, or it could be something else, but he was in way over his head because of it. He should have realized that when his GPS unit failed to work properly, but being the blind idiot he was, he had to have it told to him. Now, apparently, he was the boyfriend of his friend and rival, Ranma. How could things become any more screwed up?<p>The problem was, he couldn't just take off. If anything, his experience told him that his best chance for getting home would be to remain at the Dojo, and that meant not going anywhere without someone to guide him. A job that Ranma seemed all too willing to ask for.<p>The biggest part of the problem was that he was now taking the blame for his counterparts actions, at least if Ranma's mother was any indication. Apparently the bastard who's place he was taking was having sexual relations with his version of Ranma, and her mother was very angry at that. To top it off, it seemed his counterpart also had the family curse and had missed a lot of dates with the native Ranma. He had been terrified the evening before when Nodoka stated, without preamble, that he had better be there for their date, and that despite any prodding by her daughter, not to have sex with her. She had even implied that the two of them should get married, and soon!<p>Groaning as he rolled over, Ryouga contemplated his options, which weren't that many, and burried his head into the futon. "I've got to take her out and show her a nice time, and at the same time avoid her pushing to get into bed for sex. Kami! Why Me! Isn't it bad enough that I've seen hell thanks to my cursed form? Which vengeful spirit did this just as I made up with my Ranma?"<p>For some reason, when he said that, an image of a cute, redheaded, and sweetly smiling face entered his head.<p>He spent the next hour slamming it into the floor trying to get the image out of his mind while saying, "I don't like Ranma that way. Akari is the girl for me. I don't like Ranma that way. Akari is the girl for me..."<p>***<p>Nodoka was a bit worried.<p>Not about her child's sexual preference, or that she wanted to remain a girl. After years of being separated, she was only too happy to indulge her child in whatever kept her happy. If she had been lesbian or homosexual, she wouldn't have given a damn. Her child was too important to her to risk anything coming between them.<p>Which was why she had threatened Genma and Soun with her sword this morning, as well as prevented her husbands usual early morning spar. She was not going to risk anything harming her child, and she had to make sure that her stupid panda of a husband wasn't going to make things difficult. No matter, Genma and Soun WOULD be controlled about the situation now, at least if they wanted to keep their heads, the smaller ones that is.<p>What Nodoka was worried about had everything to do with that sex shop that they had visited yesterday, which her daughter had entered with guilty pleasure. She had to come up with something that would stop her daughter from making a spectacle of herself, especially since she was obviously sexually active. Nodoka shuddered at the thought of her daughter, in that dominatrix outfit, and the chains, handcuffs, and other...accoutrements...that she had ordered. She would die of embarrassment if her daughter did what she wanted to do and wear them to a fight. Such things were only for the bedroom!<p>She looked up as Ranma came down stairs, her makeup perfect and not a thing out of place. "Good morning daughter, did you sleep well?"<p>"Good morning mother," Ranma responded with a slight sigh, "I was having pleasant dreams about my date with Ryouga-chan this evening. Isn't he so wonderful?"<p>"It is nice that you found yourself a wonderful boy." Nodoka stated as she turned to get some tea cups, "However, don't take it too fast, young lady. I know that you are...having relations...with the boy, but I do not want to see you pregnant. At least not until you finish school."<p>Ranma blushed slightly at those words. Yep, everyone expected her to be a girl, and eventually marry a man. She'd have to pretend to be a girl until she could get that outfit, and then come up with some sort of disguise for herself. Maybe the Ghoul could help in that, and perhaps provide an artefact of some kind to enhance her own natural abilities. "Moooommm! He's just a nice boy. I like him and all, but I'm not ready to get married!"<p>Nodoka smirked and turned back to her daughter, "And what about wanting to show him all the new clothes you bought. I'm sure he would have felt a little...frisky...after seeing them."<p>"MOTHER!"<p>***<p>"OK, be calm Nabiki. It's time for damage control." She muttered to herself as she got ready for the day, "If the girls blow up, then we're all in trouble, it will be hard enough keeping Akane calm."<p>Nabiki grimaced. It was still hard to believe, in fact, it was impossible to believe. Ranma had actually acted very intelligent yesterday. He talked, answered questions, did not fight, and willingly became a girl yesterday evening. This was the opposite to the Ranma that she had known just over a year. What the hell could have happened to create this person?<p>Then again, magic, insane martial arts, kidnapping, attack helliocopters, and incursions of irritating Oni possession were only a few of the things that had happened to Nerima in the past year alone. The unusual became so commonplace in Nerima that everyone looked on in horror, or walked as if on eggshells, when an ordinary day happened. Some of the more unstable individuals had started to say that if Nerima _was_ calm for a day, then the world would end. Some had even gone so far as to predict the end of the universe.<p>So Ranma becoming a girl was just another matter of a curse, some shampoo, or magic. For all anyone knew, it could even be something Ranma ate, given that she was one to stuff her face before contemplating the consequences. In fact, that Ranma hadn't gone a week without some new weirdness was par for the course.<p>Still, even if this particular weirdness was good for Ranma, it would not be good for the rest of the district, if not the city.<p>Staring into the mirror, she grunted to herself "I've got to get a handle on this, find out if Ranma really wants to be a girl, if it's something Uncle did, or if some spell has been cast."<p>Something big was going to happen today, and she was determined to minize all the damage possible. After all, Furinken was the scene of a lot of violence, since before Ranma came there. Ever since he came, the damage went up, with the battles, the kidnapings, not to mention the infatuations...<p>"OH GODDESS! KUNO!"<p>***<p>Ukyou smirked to herself as she prepared for the day.<p>If Ranma had given up hiding behind the 'dumb martial artist' bit, then it was time that she took a better look at herself. Depending on how things went, Ukyou would define her looks. Either the sauve, enchanting, and handsome prince, or the demure, elegant princess.<p>Ukyou was hoping that Ranma would chose to be a girl, especially since that would eliminate her other rivals for Ranma's hand in marriage.<p>In either case, she had to talk to Mrs. Saotome sometime today, and see if she agreed that Ranma going to a private girls academy, with her, was the best thing. After all, if Ranma chose to be a girl, then it would be wise to move her someplace where she could get used to it, and become a lady in society. If not, then given that Ranma's curse most probably could not be cured, then it would be best if she learned what being a girl, away from her father, was like.<p>Smirking a bit, she hid the cologne that she hadn't used in almost a year in her case and left the restaurant. If she was going to be a prince to Ranma's princess, then it wouldn't do to leave the appropriate aroma's behind. Besides, she had enough perfume samples in her locker to help if Ranma decided to be the prince.<p>***<p>Akane grinned nastily as she looked at herself in the mirror.<p>Oh, she would tell the others that Ranma was being seduced by Ryouga, and that they had a very good, and sexual, relationship. She would definately tell them of all the times Ryouga tried to seduce and get Ranma for himself, after all, she wanted them to go after the right target. She would even imply that the only way to get Ranma back to normal would be to defeat the pervert and make him give up whatever magic he used.<p>However, Akane would not miss this opportunity, especially with how long Ryouga tended to leave the area at times.<p>She had to admit, styling her hair a bit differently, wearing Ranma's one male uniform that she had adjusted to her size, and binding her breasts down did make her seem a lot more masculine. She was definately in the Bishonen camp, much like Ukyou, and she was going to make sure that she pressed the engagement this way. After all, if Ranma was going to be content as a wife, then someone had to be the husband, and, although she hated to admit this, Akane made the better husband.<p>Smilling cruely, she took a bit of her fathers' after shave and put it on. Not too much, but enough to leave a hint of the smell, and perhaps entice her fiancee. "There's no way I'm going to lose Ranma. No way in hell! After having all of those girls after him and getting rid of them, there's no way I'm going to lose Ranma to Ryouga of all people!"<p>***<p>Shampoo hated the dress.<p>It wasn't flattering, it wasn't pretty, and it definately did nothing to entice the male eye.<p>But then again, her one Furinken uniform was not really designed with flattery in mind, just to slightly disguise her when she went to get the soap back from that idiot pig-boy.<p>Looking at herself, and frowning because it was so uncute, she contemplated the look. Shampoo wanted to chuck the whole thing then and there. It wasn't just the look that was bothering her, it was the material. This outfit just didn't feel comfortable.<p>"Grand-daughter, are you ready to go yet?" a voice called out to her.<p>"In a minute Grand-mother, I'm trying to get used to this." Shampoo replied, "I want to make a good impression on my beloved."<p>Outside the room, Cologne shook her head. At least her grand-daughter was finely using her head, although it was much too late. If the idiot girl could not see that she had lost the race, then having her go to school was a wise idea, at least then she'd learn something instead of pining away the hours until she next saw Ranma, or planed something disasterous.<p>She looked up at the noise, expecting Shampoo to come downstairs but was suprised when she saw Mousse dressed in a Furinken boy's uniform. "And what are you thinking of boy?"<p>Mousse grimaced in front of the Elder. "I was thinking of going to school. I've been thinking about it since we came back from Jusendo, and I'm not going to waste any more time. I've already made an appointment with an eye doctor for next week to get new glasses, or perhaps surgery if it's warranted."<p>Colongne raised an eyebrow, "Not that I'm complaining, but why? You've never been one to look for academic training."<p>Mousse laughed, an almost slightly crazed one similar to Kodachi, and which almost caused Cologne to shudder. Almost.<p>"Elder, surely you saw what happened at Mount Pheonix. Do you think I have a chance against Saotome? Do you think ANYONE in the tribe has a chance against a person who killed an immortal? I'm not crazy or stupid, despite what people think. Ranma has more power, more ability, and more luck than ANY mortal has a right to have. The only reason I went to the wedding was because if Shampoo had succeeded, she would have been dead. As it was, my actions only slightly distracted Saotome from going after her. I'll never be the martial artist he is.<p>"That said, I am not about to waste any more time. There are things in this country, in the outside world, that our village can use. Ideas, knowledge, items, and points of communication. Our people, who have long believed our martial arts is the only way, can easily die if they don't learn. Our isolation is the cause of this whole debacle, especially with some of the stupid laws that we should have done away with centuries ago. 'Chase an opponent to the ends of the earth and kill them.' That one will, in this age, end up with our people dead. 'Marry the one who defeats you, killing all obstacles in your way.' That one will also end up with our people dead, or imprisoned. You know what some of the people in this place call us after learning about those laws?<p>"To them we are no better than barbarians. People who have no decency, no culture, and no intelligence. Just lapdogs who put a veneer of civilization on their base desires. To them, we are no better than slavers. People who want to own other people as property. And they look upon Shampoo in just that way.<p>"Forgive me Elder, if this is not what you want to hear, but the truth is the truth." Mousse then quickly left before the old mummy could conk him over the head and render him unconcious.<p>Cologne frowned. There was no doubt what he said held a grain of truth. Hell the whole truth. People in the outside world were much too powerful, and the tools they used could defeat them easily. Perhaps the boy was right, and, although she did not like the backbone he was showing to her, it was time to review her peoples history and laws, and the place men had in society.<p>Shampoo just leaned against her door, having heard the conversation. If that was how people viewed her, viewed her people and her culture, and saw what she was doing in that manner, then perhaps that is why Ranma refused to have anything to do with her. She would have to think about this, there was much that needed to change about herself it would seem.<p>***<p>Nabiki sighed with relief as she got to school before the others. As usual, her prime money source was standing near the gates of the high school waiting for Ranma so that he could defeat him. Why he never figured out the curse, or the fact that both Ranma and Akane hated him, she would never figure out. Inviting them to the wedding had been a financial boon, but it was also an extreme annoyance.<p>"Good morning Kuno-chan. How is it going?"<p>"Good morning Tendo-san, and to what do I owe the pleasure of your company this day?" replied Kuno calmly.<p>"I wanted to ask that you lay off Akane and your pig-tailed girl for a little while. There has been a small family emergency, and they are not quite feeling themselves." Nabiki said, getting into negotiation mode.<p>"I am quite agreeable to this. I was going to ask Ranma if she wished to spar this fine day, but that can wait. The number of defeats I have suffered at her hands over the past year are indication enough that I have to do better." Kuno said.<p>Nabiki stared at him. "Are you feeling all right Kuno? You don't have to see the doctor or anything do you?"<p>"No. I'm waiting for my father right now. He should be here soon as I forgot to bring a change of clothes with me. This morning's practice went very well, and I suspect we will win the regional tournament this year. Ah...There he is now."<p>Nabiki looked towards the gate and nearly fainted. Principal Kuno was dressed in a regular suit and tie instead of his usual Hawaian look, and he had lost his palm tree. He even left the sunglasses behind. Looking at that, and Kuno, she backed away slowly. She saw the principal hand his son a suit bag, and they left towards the school.<p>"By all the Kami! Kuno giving up his fight, the principal in normal clothes, and Ranma acting like a young girl in love? It is the end of the world!" Nabiki almost screamed.<p>Her associates came up and looked at her. "What are we going to do Tendo-sempai, Kuno declared this morning that Ranma is not to be attacked, or HE will face them. When someone brought up Ranma's curse, Kuno said that it is the duty of all of those who strive for the ideals of the Samurai to protect all women, including those who have been cursed. Half of our business will be gone, and we're going to have to pay out on the 'When is Kuno going to get a clue' pool!"<p>At those word, Nabiki did faint.<p>***<p>Ranma still couldn't believe it, and just kept looking at Akane out of the side of her eye, trying to pretend that there wasn't anything wrong. Thank the Kami that she was familiar with role playing games, or there would be no way she could pull this off. Akane, wearing a boy's uniform was almost unbelievable.<p>"Is there anything wrong Ranma-chan?" Akane asked, smirking inwardly at her fiancee's body language.<p>"Noooo...I was just thinking how handsome you look like that. If I didn't have Ryouga, I might just fall for you." Ranma answered, her head bent down looking demure and shy.<p>It was the perfect opening.<p>Akane took her fiancees hand, and gently kissed it, then looked into Ranma's eyes. "You are sweet, you know that? I think I've fallen in love with you despite how our fathers are trying to make us marry against our will."<p>She then bent down on her knee, and looked Ranma in the face. "Darling, I want us to be together, not because of our fathers, but because we want to. Will you consent to be my wife!"<p>Ranma's mind almost shut down. AKANE, the one who always wanted to be feminine, was asking for her to marry her? For her to be Akane's wife while she took up the male role? Something was definately wrong. She WOULD have to visit that shop after school and make the costume a rush job. There was no help for it if Akane was acting so out of character, and from the looks of things, believing herself to be a boy!<p>Akane just looked on as Ranma flushed and started to stammer, not saying yes or no. Well, if she didn't say yes right now, then it would come soon. She would not give up.<p>To be continued...
