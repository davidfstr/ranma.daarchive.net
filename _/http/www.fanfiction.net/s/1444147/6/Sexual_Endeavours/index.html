</div><p>Ok, I don't know why, but has become dificult to work  with when trying to put something up correctly. It keeps  removing, redoing, and messing up half the story. It took about  an hour to finaly type in what was needed. Sorry the formatting  is not correctly done, but the people at have made their  decisions.</p><p>(break)</p><p>Ranma blinked wearily as she looked at  herself in the mirror.</p><p>Hair mussed, eyes bloodshot, and the  pain in her hips was indication enough that this was not going to be a good  day.</p><p>Worse yet, she fainted. Fainted like she was some weak little girl.</p><p>Of course, the earrings, the cute elaborate nightie, and the leftover make-up added to this look.</p><p>No wonder girls took so long in the wash  room. Besides having to take off a lot  of clothes just to pee, they had to remove all of the make-up, wash, use that  alcohol stuff to clean out all the little particles, then apply moisturiser to  reverse the effect of the alcohol. Then  wait 2 to three minutes before applying the look they wanted for the day. Then, as she learned in school yesterday,  there was the added inconvenience of having to reapply virtually her entire  make-up that she put on in the morning every several hours, or less, depending  on her activity.</p><p>If she ever heard anyone, such as her  father, say that girls were weak, didn't know how to do anything, and time  wasters ever again, she would make sure that they regretted their words for a  good long time.</p><p>Of course, given the number of perverted  boys in her school, it wouldn't take that long for it to happen. Then a tiny blast here, perhaps a pulled up  pair of underpants, or maybe even a kick in where all those idiots seemed to  think would be in order. The problem was  she wouldn't be able to do it.</p><p>Her mother would disapprove.</p><p>Maybe she should ask Akane the secret of  that mallet attack. At least it was  something a lot of girls in the anime and manga that she'd been studying seemed  to do...</p><p>Nodoka went around the kitchen in a bit  of joy.</p><p>She was no longer worried about her  daughter.</p><p>Nope, not one bit.</p><p>Her daughter had chosen her mate, and  that mate was a strong, handsome martial artist, well able to teach the higher  forms of martial arts.</p><p>Of course, this meant that she would  have to convince them to have lots of babies. Lots and lots of tiny, cute, sweet, little babies.</p><p>Just not yet.</p><p>"My word! Auntie Nodoka, should you be dancing with hot  soup in your hands?"</p><p>Nodoka looked over toward the young  woman who spoke. "It's a joyous day,  Kasumi. After breakfast is served, I  need to prepare the formal tea set."</p><p>"Oh my, is something wrong?"</p><p>"No, Kasumi. Everything is just right." smiled Nodoka to her eldest daughter. She would have to see about getting her  engaged as well. After all, she  shouldn't feel left out. She wanted to  know all of her daughters mates, and about their...</p><p>Sexual Endeavours</p><p>Part Six:</p><p>They say the way to a man's heart is...</p><p>A fan fiction based on Takahashi  Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2</p><p>Saotome Ranma, Saotome Genma, Saotome  Nodoka, Tendo Akane, Tendo Soun, Tendo Kasumi, Tendo Nabiki, Kuonji Ukyou,  Hibiki Ryouga, P-chan, Shampoo, Shan Pu, Mousse, Mu Tsu, Cologne, Ku Lon, Kuno  Tatewaki, Kuno Kodachi, Tofu-Sensei, and Hinako Sensei are copyright 1987, 2002  by Takahashi Rumiko.</p><p>Edited by Digital Civilization  Multimedia Productions Group Inc.</p><p>Publishing rights:</p><p>Japan by</p><p>Shogakukan Inc.

No challengers coming out of the woodwork, No  attack helicopters chasing school girls, the fiancée squad being kind, and considerate  of my feelings, and the school actually being normal for once. It was as if Kami-sama had declared that  Nerima would be...well, not normal, but...</i> Ranma paused as she realized that there was  nothing she could compare it to.</p><p>No way could this be her life.</p><p>Of course, the time spent had not been  without it's own weird excitement...</p><p>(break)</p><p>Finally ready for the day, Ranma went  downstairs in order to have a good breakfast. She was still sore in her chest, and her bottom where she had  unexpectedly hit the ground. She would  have to remember that the dragon controlled by her enemy could strike with  force instead of flames or energy as she had expected. A trip to the Manga stores would be in order  for research materials.</p><p>Perhaps a trip to a speciality store  featuring role playing books as well. She had always dealt with the monsters in the games as she had in life,  as she had been thought experience was worth more, and the were things that  were not written down. Unfortunately,  that was no longer an option as protecting people was more important. Besides, everyone expected her to be a good  girl, and that meant being studious.</p><p>Sitting down at her usual place, and  concentrating on the food in front of her, she failed to notice that Akane was  glaring at Ryouga, and that her date from the night before was nervously  shuffling his food instead of eating it.</p><p>"Good morning, Ranma. Did you have a good time last night?" Kasumi asked lightly.</p><p>"Uh? Oh, yes I did, although my chest and bottom are still a bit sore," Ranma  stated as she was making a mental list of the types of manga that she would  need to pick up. Some magical girl ones  would be good, although Wedding Peach and Miracle Girls were the only ones she  remembered offhand...</p><p>She failed to notice her mother's eyes  open and the glare / speculation she gave Ryouga.</p><p>She failed to notice Akane crack her  chopsticks and stare lasers at Ryouga.</p><p>She failed to notice Nabiki's wide eyes  as they scanned the three people sitting across from her.</p><p>She failed to notice Genma start to  faint.</p><p>She dismissed Soun's wailing as that  happened so often.</p><p>She did notice when Ryouga's hand grabbed  hers and she was literally flying out of the house and down the street. <i>Have to  add Project A-Ko to the Manga I pick up.</i></p><p>Everyone, (Except Soun who was too  caught up in the fact that Ranma was now a 'fallen girl'), stayed still for a  moment.</p><p>Kasumi's next comment caused everyone to  fall on the ground, "I guess Ryouga wanted to play with Ranma-chan some more  before school starts."</p><p>(break)</p><p>She still couldn't understand what  happened that morning. Ryouga had pulled  her directly to the school, actually going with her from class to class. It was as if he was afraid to leave her, even  for a few seconds.</p><p>(Actually, Ryouga was trying to get  lost, really lost so that Akane wouldn't kill him. Unfortunately for him, his direction sense  made him get lost, getting lost, so that it seemed he could find his way where  he wanted to go, whenever he wanted. All  it ended up doing was fuel rumours, raise Akane's temper, and endear him to  Nodoka.)</p><p>Then again, she was trying to find some  way to stay here as her mother had somehow gotten the idea that she should go  to a private school. Fortunately, it was  unlikely as they didn't have the money, but the brochures that were on the  table...</p><p>(break)</p><p>"This is a good idea, Ukyou, but there  are a few...considerations...that need to be taken into account." Nodoka stated as she had tea with one of the  girls who was after her daughter.</p><p>Ukyou smiled, looking out the window of  the café for a moment. "At least  consider it. I know it's on the  expensive side, but I'm more than willing to support my girlfriends education."</p><p>Nodoka's eyebrow raised at that, "You're  willing to support Ranma?"</p><p>Ukyou looked Nodoka right in the  eye. "I will always support Ranma. No matter what, no matter how. She's a bright, intelligent girl, one who is  just discovering herself. Right now,  however, her education is important. She  may be able to kill a Kami, but she wouldn't be able to survive in today's  world without a proper education. I  admit, the thought of a stay at home wife is nice, but I want Ranma to have  options other than raising children or taking care of our home."</p><p>"You're serious."</p><p>"Very  serious. I love Ranma, and am willing to do all I can  to protect her. I understand her better  than everyone else, considering that almost everyone considers me a  boy. I'm also willing to be with her and defend her  virtue, rather than take advantage of her." Ukyou stated in an intense  voice. "I'm willing to be her prince, her knight in shining armour, and  an  equal partner. I want Ranma as my wife,  and I am willing to commit everything I have to prove it."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "As you are serious about this, I will  consider it. I have to observe her  behaviour a little more, and if I feel she can benefit from going to an academy  for the elite, I will give my permission. You must be willing to prove to me, however, that you are considering  the future."</p><p>Ukyou  rose and bowed, and placed several  booklets in front of the Saotome matriarch. "I will take my leave of  you then. At the very least, look over these and consider their  qualifications."</p><p>Nodoka sighed as she watched the girl go  to pay the bill. She hadn't the heart to  tell her that Ranma was clearly smitten with Ryouga. Then again, if he proved unreliable she would  be well worth considering. Looking at  the first booklet, she noticed that it was a private academy for girls. Frowning, she then looked thought all the  booklets quickly. "Well, it seems  someone wants to keep Ryouga away from my daughter..."</p><p>(break)</p><p>Yeah right. Like she would go to an all girls  school. First time in the shower, and  she'd be killed.</p><p>Still, in a way she wished that things  wouldn't go back to normal. She had  wished he would get a clue, understand, and be nice and respectful. The new attitude that Kuno had was what  really drove it home that someone had enchanted the entire district, if not the  city...</p><p>(break)</p><p>"Ah, Ranma, lovely day isn't it?"  Tatewaki said as he was entering the school in uniform.</p><p>Ranma blinked and said, "Ah...yes it is,  sempai. Is there something special about  it?"</p><p>"No, but I would like to teach you the  proper way to hold a sword, instead of using your fists." he chuckled.</p><p>Ok, Kuno being nice, offering to train  her, and not spouting off that Ranma defeated him by using magic of some  type. "Are you feeling all right,  sempai?"</p><p>"Quite well. Better than I have for years," the former  'Blue Thunder' stated as he left for class.</p><p>"Ok," Ranma murmured to herself, "have  to add...What manga can explain this?"</p><p>Nabiki was frozen as she looked on. Her entire empire was falling apart as the  linchpin had always been the stupidity of the Kuno's. She didn't understand anything anymore, and  was disparately trying to find a way to return things to normal without being  too obvious. The weirdness factor was  already rising in her home.</p><p>She had seen and experienced the  impossible, and was literally too scared to say anything out loud in fear that  whatever was happening would capture her as well. Everything that defined her life was gone. It  was as if the universe had decided to throw out all the rules that pertained to  reality.</p><p>Ranma being obvious in having sex with  Ryouga.</p><p>Akane now dressing and acting like a  boy.</p><p>Shampoo being calm, nice, and normal in  that she was acting like a school girl who didn't have super strength.</p><p>The principal without a palm tree on his  head.</p><p>Kuno being around people without being  delusional.</p><p>Mouse, attending school, not bothering  Shampoo, and acting like Ranma's older brother.</p><p>And to top it off, people were now going  to Yuka for their information, without paying for it.</p><p>The only one in the entire school that  was acting semi-normally was Ukyou, and there was no telling when the weird  factor would strike the chef. How had  things slipped so far out of her control?</p><p>How could she get back into control?</p><p>(break)</p><p>With everything happening as it was,  what else could go wrong with her life?</p><p>(break)</p><p>"It just doesn't add up." Sakura  muttered to herself as she travelled through the Juku. "Ranma should have been here at least once  this week, and he hasn't called in at all."</p><p>She'd finally figured out how to code  the text of the program into a very small space, and was waiting to present the  scheme to the others, but with Ranma writing the main story, she'd had to wait  longer than expected. Whatever was the  matter, it had to be big given his average day. She wondered how much would be added to the story from the latest  adventure.</p><p>"Sakura, wait up!" a voice called from  behind her.</p><p>She sighed, then turned around to look  at Misa. "What is it?"</p><p>"Did you hear the latest?"</p><p>Gossip again. If it wasn't being boy crazy, it was  gossip. How she qualified to enter the  Juku was beyond her. "Hear what?"</p><p>"Guess what's been confirmed!"</p><p>"What."</p><p>"Tendo Akane is a lesbian, and she's  trying to get into Ranma's panties."</p><p>Sakura rolled her eyes, "Right.  Sure. It's true. Do you realize that someone says that at  least once or twice a week?"</p><p>"But it's been confirmed by her  friends!"</p><p>Grabbing  Misa by the shoulder, Sakura  looked into her eyes and said slowly, so that the girl in front of her  would  understand. "First, Ranma would not  willingly wear women's clothes for extended periods. It would really  hurt him if she was splashed  with hot water given the size difference. Second, despite the rumours,  Akane is after Ranma. A male Ranma. Third, before you say it, Ukyou is  not a lesbian either. She just has to pretend to be a boy because  of family honour. Fourth, other rumours  have Ranma dating men. Only Kuno  believes that. Ranma's straight, and  will date girls, not boys."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>"Misa, I'll head to Nerima myself, and  I'll prove these rumours wrong." said an exasperated Sakura as she headed to  her next class.</p><p>(break)</p><p>"How is the investigation going,  Ota-kun" the captain asked at the daily meeting.</p><p>"Not  too good. At first I thought we were dealing with a  group of high technology criminals, but we finished examining some of  the  camera's that were just outside the banks area. It seems as though we  have a level three incident. I must warn you that it's currently  unconfirmed,  however, the tapes seem to bear out this conclusion.</p><p>Captain Isahikawa groaned. "Are you sure that it isn't one of the  locals?"</p><p>Ota grimaced. "Fairly sure. Some of the evidence doesn't fit into the level three incident files, so  it may be one of the others passing through."</p><p>"Do you know how much trouble a level  three would bring to this area? We  already have enough trouble keeping tabs on the group that follows that Ranma  kid!" Officer Kinomoto Taya exclaimed as she lay her head on her desk. "We're still doing the paperwork on that  fight they had a month ago!"</p><p>Lieutenant Katagiri Ota face took on a  stern expression. "There is something  else you should know. I managed to find  two witnesses that were willing to talk, and they said that after the  explosion, a girl came down from the sky. It gets sketchy from there, but they ran after a dragon appeared."</p><p>The captain shook his head, "Where are  you going with this?"</p><p>"That's the main problem. According to the physical evidence, there was  some type of energy blast that marked a wall. On the other hand, we found chemical residue and, believe it or not,  clear plastic dumped all over the place. We're not sure why that is, but it seems that the plastic contained some  type of low level explosive. This is not  consistent with the level three incidents in past, which is why we have some  confusion. I would like to investigate  further, but if it is a level three, standing orders are not to interfere or  determine who the level three is.</p><p>"This is fucking perfect!" Kinomoto  shouted. "How the hell are we supposed  to keep everyone safe! If there is a  level three, and they connect with the local loons, then the we could have more  than just some property damage!"</p><p>"OK, for now, we classify the incident  as officially unsolved. Ota, you will  continue your investigation discretely, and I mean discretely. I want a description, and install those new  mini cams in likely spots for a confrontation. Taya, I want you to begin surveillance of the martial artists.  Concentrate on Ranma, since everything seems to revolve around him."</p><p>(break)</p><p>Unbelievable as it seemed, he couldn't  find a person to become an 'adversary', even after two weeks of searching. Finding a young girl, who was physically fit  and willing to become a criminal, was not easy. It was especially hard as the  person would have to have extraordinary talent in the fighting arts. The 'Magical Girl' aspect would have to wait  as the next scheduled crime was tonight. Several millions in jewels were to be had, although come to think of it,  it may not be the best idea.</p><p>He had the 'villainous hero', and he was  looking for someone to create a 'beautiful heroic adversary' who would always  fail, but perhaps stealing a lot was not in the best interest, especially this  early in the game. The crime was  planned, but something had to change to make it seem as though there was something  more to the crimes, something to throw off the officials when they started to  investigate. Yes, a slight change in  plans was necessary.</p><p>He picked up the encoded phone, dialled,  and waited for an answer. "When the  market opens, I only want a single cherry. Nothing else is to be bought."</p><p>Hanging up, he grinned. Long term goals were better than short term  gain.</p><p>(break)</p><p>This wasn't right. The tension that was prevalent in the area  was now tinged with a desperate edge. The shopkeepers, the shoppers, and everyone she saw was almost literally  ready to jump behind any available object. People were on the verge of panic.</p><p>Sakura  went up to one of the snack  machines, and caused a slight young man who was trying to purchase a  beer to  scream. Suddenly everyone on the street  was running. Sakura blinked as she  hadn't seen something like this except in a monster movie marathon that  the  boys had insisted they watch one time. It was as hokey in real life as  it was in the film. Sighing, she shook her head and looked at the  rather pathetic representation of the human species in front of her.  "Why is everyone acting like the world is  about to end."</p><p>Gosunkugi, the said pathetic  representation of humanity responded, "Because it is!"</p><p>Sakura blinked, then rolled her eyes,  "OK...How. Alien invasion, the  Apocalypse, a war of the Gods, Gojira is coming for a visit?"</p><p>"Any and all of the above, if not  worse!" a distraught Gosunkugi wailed, "We've already seen the four western  signs of the Apocalypse!"</p><p>Rubbing her forehead, Sakura asked, "And  these four signs are..."</p><p>Hikaru  Blinked. Blinked so hard that a person could actually  hear the blink, thus the capitalization. There was a girl talking to  him. A very pretty, very beautiful girl, an intelligent girl. She  wanted to know what he had to say, what  he knew, what his ideas were. She was  interested in HIM!</p><p>Poor Sakura didn't realize what she had  unleashed.</p><p>The 'Dogs Of War' had nothing on a Gosunkugi  male in terms of obsession, especially when it concerned a female of the human  species.</p><p>With Gosunkugi Hikaru, that could be  said to be a female, any female, who showed the tiniest kindness to him. Having a girl, other than his mother, show  him kindness was so rear, it was to be treasured beyond all the riches in the  world. To have a female who was  obviously intelligent and asking HIS opinion on a subject, any subject, that  was something to swoon over. To have one  clearly interested in his area of expertise? Hikaru had to make her his, no matter what the cost.</p><p>Standing tall, he let some of his hair  fall over his eyes trying to take on a look of mystery.</p><p>Sakura groaned internally, remembering  Ranma's comment on the weirdo's of this region, and why he recommended NOT  talking with people on the street if you could help it.</p><p>"Western religion has stated that there  will come an Apocalypse, one where mankind will struggle to survive forces  beyond their comprehension, beyond that which is known, and that will change  the world. In each telling, there are  the four signs, the four precursor's to this great disaster. This has led to the adoption of the 'Four  Horsemen' as the most common explanation of the precursor's of the  apocalypse. They are known as Famine,  Sickness, Death, and Fear. Of all of  them, Fear is to take the most.</p><p>"However, this is not necessarily what  the four signs will be.</p><p>"For those of us here, in this  mysterious and strange region in the City of  Tokyo, we have our  own legends, our own deeply disturbing signs, and these are considered more  accurate than those of the Western 'Four Horsemen'.</p><p>"The first sign is that which will never  be. For if it comes to pass, it means  that the gates to hell have cracked open, and all of the denizens of the nine  hells have lined up to take the Lands of Mortality on the command of the Dark  Lords of the Infernal Planes.</p><p>"The second sign is that of a reversal,  for it means that the God's and Goddesses, and all the Kami of the land have  turned their backs upon the Lands of Mortality. They will not interfere unless Mortality's champion can defeat the Three  Representatives of the Dark Lords.</p><p>"The third sign is that of Loss, for it  is said that Loss will rise and contain the control that Mortals have attained  in their lives and over the elements of the Lands of Mortality.</p><p>"The last sign is that of intense  sanity, for that is the what is needed for the denizens of hells to torment the  Mortals of the lands of Mortality.</p><p>"These have occurred in the following  manner:</p><p>"First, Saotome Ranma, who has repeated  hated his cursed life, and has always declared his Manliness, to the Point of  Stupidity at times, has embraced her cursed and has become the most Feminine of  all Females.</p><p>"Second, Tendo Akane has become  enamoured with Ranma, and has done all she could to become male. This in response to the obvious courting that  Hibiki Ryouga has been doing. He has  become the most Romantic Male that the women of Furinken have seen, protecting  her honour above all. Shampoo, of the  Amazons has decided that she should become a scholar instead of following her  barbaric cultural upbringing. Mousse, the  most deadly of the local Martial Artists, has become her older brother, and  talks to her constantly, lending an understanding ear and protecting her honour  from unwelcome suitors.</p><p>"Third, control has been lost by Tendo  Nabiki, whose reputation touches all. She has not been able to control the rumours, control the situations, or  control people as she has before. Her  power has been broken.</p><p>"Finally, the most insane of the  students, Kuno Tatewaki, has acknowledged that he was wrong, and has recognized  Ranma's situation, going so far as to apologize in front of all of the students  knowing that he would face Loss of Status. However, he has gained in status because of his recognition of the problem,  and of his sincere turnaround.</p><p>"Thus have the four signs, that Nerima  will recognize, been met."</p><p>Sakura Blinked. See above for the explanation as it is not  necessary to repeat it. "You mean that's  all? Are you sure it isn't a joke?"</p><p>Gosunkugi slowly raised his head, his  sunken and tired eyes lending an eerie feel to the situation, at least he liked  to think so, "It is the unfortunate truth, and it affects all who are  here. While no battles have happened,  and all has been peaceful, this is but the calm before the eventual storm,  where all will be held in thrall to the Doom."</p><p>"No fights and battles? I would think that people would like  that." Sakura replied.</p><p>"Normally they would, but with what has  happened, the signs indicate that something supernatural is happening, and all  are afraid and wary. The Doom is at hand  unless the Champion appears, and only if she is able to defeat the evil that  threatens the populace."</p><p>Sakura narrowed her eyes, "And how do  you know that the 'champion' that you speak of will be female?"</p><p>Hikaru laughed, "For all our history,  the times of peace, the times of understanding have been led by the female of  the species. Indeed, I would think a, to  use the modern usage, 'Maho Shojo' will appear, as they have in past. For the fight against the dark Lords of the  Infernal Planes is never ending."</p><p>"You bring up many...interesting  speculations."</p><p>Hikaru reached into his pocket and gave  her his meishi, "If you wish to know more, contact me, and I will be happy to  tell you what you need to know."</p><p>Sakura bowed, "Thank you, I may just do  that."</p><p>Hikaru bowed back and left. He had to find that shop he was in the other  day and buy a couple of the kimono. Now  that he had hooked her, she needed to see the true magician that he was. Impressions were important, and he had to  ensure that they were good one. Time to  check out that book in the library that described how to act mysteriously  powerful in order to impress friend and enemies.</p><p>Sakura shook her head as the skinny boy  left. She would have to talk to him  again, since he had a VERY good imagination. That, or the poor boy was the victim of an elaborate practical  joke. "I best not let Ranma know that  I'm here and observe. This sounds like  something out of his story."</p><p>She started, could that be it? Ranma was intelligent enough, so could he  have influenced the entire area in order to test out his story?</p><p>Snorting, Sakura didn't have to think  about it. It was just the thing he would  do.</p><p>(break)</p><p>This operation was not going to make any  money.</p><p>They all knew this, but with what they  had witnessed last time, with that Gem character, it was necessary.</p><p>Two minutes to show time, all was in  place.</p><p>(break)</p><p>Ranma was actually having a good  time. The girls that Akane usually hung  around with, Yuka and Sayuri, were a fountain of knowledge about Shojo manga,  and especially, Magical Girls. This  would expand her research opportunities, especially as the Tendo household was  devoid of such manga. Nabiki's tastes  ran more to the unusual, not useful ones, such as sports, Akane's tastes ran  more to the shonen style as she was interested in power more than skill, and  Kasumi, she didn't even want to try and look at what she read or  collected. Given how peaceful, and, well  brain dead she seemed, whatever she read was obviously eating her brain, or  that was the impression she had. Besides, they liked ice cream as much as she did, and it did taste  better when one ate it slowly. Especially the chocolate fudge liberally poured over the top.</p><p>Sayuri shook her head, "I can't believe  the look on your face, Ranma. Do you  realize that you look like you're having an orgasm?"</p><p>Ranma blushed, "Sa-Yu-Ri...Do YOU have  to say that?"</p><p>Sayuri giggled, "Come on, Ranma, don't  tell me that you've never thought about it. I mean you've got Akane, Ukyo, Ryouga, and Shampoo after you!"</p><p>Yuka sighed, especially since Sayuri was  always a bit of a pervert. "What she means is that you're the most popular  student at school. She's thinking of how  many people want to get into your panties. This includes Akane, well, ESPECIALLY Akane."</p><p>Ranma looked at Yuka, "What do you  mean? I know she proposed to me the  other day on the way to school, but I sort of expect that by now. She isn't the most subtle of people."</p><p>Sayuri was looking at Yuka, she smelled  good gossip, and this was the sort of stuff she lived for. ""Tell all Yuka."</p><p>Yuka grimaced at both her  companions. She still couldn't get the  strange comments out of her head, although she always felt that Akane leaned  that way. Besides her declaration of  hating men, she was a lot like a boy herself. "Well, about two weeks ago, I was passing an alley, and I heard Akane  declare that she wanted in your panties. As in she was jealous of Ryouga, and wanted to prevent him from having  sex with you. She wants to be the only  one to have sex with you."</p><p>Ranma's blush became fierce, almost as  red as her hair. "You're kidding! Akane always acts as if sex is the worst  thing in the universe!"</p><p>Sayuri giggled even more. This was great gossip, and what's more, it  fit perfectly! "Well, that may be  because of your curse to turn into a boy. She's interested in you as a girl,  not as a boy. Of course, she couldn't  admit that openly, at least not with how all those boys act!"</p><p>Ranma stuck her tongue out. "As if the boys in school were worth  much. Do you know...wait you do. They are annoying, cloying, immature kids who  think the greatest thing in the world is to see our breasts!"</p><p>Yuka glanced at the greatest  contradiction she knew. Here was Ranma,  the only person who was a blend of male and female. Of innocence and maturity, and she was  clueless. Yuka blamed Ranma's father  naturally. She had the unfortunate  opportunity to meet the bastard once, and it was a wonder that the girl in  front of her turned out so well. Given  how Ranma was acting recently, it was obvious that the real curse was to turn  into a boy. As a girl, Ranma was MUCH  more intelligent and outgoing. "What  about Ryouga, and how he acts around you."</p><p>Ranma blushed again, "Well, he's an old  friend, and he's fairly handsome..."</p><p>Ranma realized she would have to act a  bit ditzy, and her smile started to slightly increase, as if  unconsciously. Unless she wanted to  alert who had created this situation, she would have to make this the greatest  acting job in the universe. "...cute,  has the nicest smile, and he's strong and...handsome." Ranma let off a small sigh that seemed  unconscious. "Not that I'm interested or  anything."</p><p>Yuka and Sayuri looked at each other. The girl had it bad for Ryouga.</p><p>"You know, he's very protective of you,"  Yuka said, "I wonder how many fights with your other suitors he'll get into?"</p><p>Ranma groaned, "That's all I need. Fights which don't need to happen."</p><p>"You know, it's almost like the Iczar  manga, with you being the priestess!" Sayuri exclaimed.</p><p>"I don't know about that, Iczar wasn't  after her to marry until much later, and even then, the love she showed wasn't  exactly that of a lover."</p><p>"I don't know, she was rather obvious in  how much she lusted after the priestess."</p><p>The discussion degenerated into the  motivations of various characters in manga. It got silly after that.</p><p>(break)</p><p>They  weren't going to make any money on  this particular job, but the boss insisted that only a small ruby be  taken from  the store. Why, he couldn't imagine, but  Maruyama Tsuneyo was not one to back out. The appearance of that Gem  might have something to do with it. This mission was more like a  strategic test  than one for making money like crazy. "You're expecting something,  aren't you?"</p><p>The boss looked at him, his monocle,  gleaming in the light. "Perhaps. We should know what opponents are there, and  the only thing that will be taken is the ruby. If She shows up again, I'll be ready, however, this will also throw the  police into chaos as they will need to determine what the motive was in  stealing only one small jewel rather than as much as we can get in the store; a  ready made situation which will make them chase ghosts instead of really  following our crime spree."</p><p>"Whatever you say boss. I'll make sure the distractions are ready."</p><p>(break)</p><p>As the three girls were heading home, a  small explosion took place, and the neighbourhood stared as beings in very  strange costumes appeared and started to attack a small jewellery store. It was like one of those Sentai shows that  entertained the younger kids.</p><p>"Do you think we walked onto a film  set?" Yuka asked.</p><p>"Could be, what do you think Ranma?"  Sayuri replied.</p><p>Yuka looked when Ranma didn't respond.  "She's gone."</p><p>A sudden shout came from above.  "STOP! Jewels are to enhance one's  beauty, not to be taken as a prize."</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw the girl in a  very sexy leather outfit. One with heels  which a person should not be able to stand on. She leapt down and stated, "Descending upon evil like an Angel, I am  GEM. I will stop your marauding and  deliver you to justice."</p><p>The reactions were varied.</p><p>Yuka and Sayuri were sure they were on a  television show that they didn't know was filming.</p><p>The boss frowned, it seemed that this  magical girl was protecting this area. This was bad as it was the best one for minimum police interference.</p><p>An off-duty Officer Kinomoto was now  banging her head against a handy pole. The paperwork on this would be murder.</p><p>Sakura looked and smiled. She had her target, and whispered, "Ranma!"</p><p>To be continued...</p>
