</div><p>Kinomoto  Taya usually loved mornings.</p><p>She  loved waking to the city, seeing the bright smiles of school  children, and having a good cup of fragrant coffee.</p><p>This  particular morning could go to hell for all she cared.</p><p>It  started with the radio, broadcasting a small report on the new urban  legend. Not like the legend that Ranma and his 'friends' had created  around their activities, but one that REALLY troubled her. She  really couldn't see the point of having a person dressed like that  becoming a hero.</p><p>What  was worse was the amateur video that had popped up and was being  broadcast on several channels. The stations just had to show the  girls panties as their first shot, the fluttering skirt, and then  catching the girl in a pose that, to her mind, screamed sex. If,  like the usual Class Three incidents, this got well known, they would  have to start production on films to cover everything up. Already,  people in the department were starting to spin the incident off as an  aberration, while others were starting to gather data to make a  fictitious film company that was backdated at least a year.</p><p>As  she was the officer on scene, even off duty, she was expecting the  worst duty to fall to her.</p><p>It  was a duty that she DIDN'T want as she had heard some horror stories  from the two people in her station that already had the  responsibility of the Class Two incidents. She had also met others  in the 'police conventions' that also had that duty thanks to those  two. All of them were two fisted drinkers whenever they got the  chance.</p><p>Looking  at her coffee, she made a decision. It would be a first, but she  needed it, and she could always have a case delivered this morning.  She picked up the phone and called a discrete distributor while  thinking, 'Thank god that it wasn't classified as a type Four or  Five. Covering up a giant robot or something like that would be  hell. We don't have enough construction teams to deal with that in  this area.'</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Colonge  almost spit out her tea at what she was seeing. Mr. Part Time, as  crazy as it sounded, was correct. Ranma had become a magical girl.<p>She  smirked as she had the thought, 'Just like my games. I can have some  fun with this if I can remember where I put those old toys from when  I was a child.'</p><p>Shampoo  was staring at the television screen.</p><p>What  she was seeing defied imagination, was impossible, and, not  surprisingly, completely within character for the area she lived in.</p><p>On  the screen was Ranma, dressed in a very provocative  fighting suit. She was blasting the bad guys with her Ki and sending  them napping. It seemed unreal, like all television battles of this  nature, what with the extreme use of Ki shots and the fact that it  didn't seem she was hitting them with enough force to send them  flying like that. Of course, this was the first time that she had  seem a battle where the opponent was so outclassed by the fighter,  and the fighter being careful not to kill the idiot in front of her.</p><p>Then  she saw something which broke her heart.</p><p>The  villain had shot something from the sleeve of his coat at Ranma, and  she was suddenly choking without an obvious reason. Whatever it was,  this blackguard was powerful in his own right. Thats when a man with  a cloak, a mask, and an unusual hat came down, tossed something at  the bad guy, and picked up Ranma and made off with her. The villains  disappeared in a cloud of smoke soon after that.</p><p>Ranma  was one of the mystical warriors of Japan.</p><p>"So  what do you think of what you just saw Great-Granddaughter?"</p><p>"Aya!   She strong! She must be descendent of  Xena! Would be good to help if knew who was!"</p><p>Cologne  grimaced. Her great granddaughter was an idiot if she didn't know  who that was. Of course, given how she acted these past few weeks,  it was more likely she was concerned with what was happening with  Ranma's 'becoming a girl in order to escape reality'. It was  tempting, oh so tempting to hit her upside the head with her staff,  but that wouldn't be any fun. As it was, she was glad that Shampoo  had failed in her...</p><p>Sexual  Endeavours</p><p>Part  Seven:</p><p>A  loaf of bread,</p><p>A  wheel of cheese,</p><p>A  bottle of wine</p><p>And...</p><p>A  fan fiction based on Takahashi Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2</p><p>Saotome  Ranma, Saotome Genma, Saotome Nodoka, Tendo Akane, Tendo Soun, Tendo  Kasumi, Tendo Nabiki, Kuonji Ukyou, Hibiki Ryouga, P-chan, Shampoo,  Shan Pu, Mousse, Mu Tsu, Cologne, Ku Lon, Kuno Tatewaki, Kuno  Kodachi, Tofu-Sensei, and Hinako Sensei are copyright 1987, 2002 by  Takahashi Rumiko.</p><p>Edited  by Digital Civilization Multimedia Productions Group Inc.</p><p>Publishing  rights:Japan byShogakukan Inc. Tokyo</p><p>Hong  Kong by Jademan (Holdings) Ltd.</p><p>North  America by Viz Inc.</p><p>Written  by Ichinohei Hitomi</p><p>With  help from Robert Haynie and the people on #Akane</p><p>Sakura  was smirking to herself as she prepared to go to  school. From all that she had learned yesterday, and from the copy  of the story that she had, Ranma was making the script come to life.  How he got the idiots of the area to have an adversary, and get the  others to start creating a 'magical girl' team was beyond her, but  she and the others could have a lot of fun with this.</p><p>"Ranma,"  she muttered to herself, "You've got the craziest ways of  testing out programs and stories, then again, you can get away with  it if that skinny character is what you have to deal with daily."</p><p>Of  course, everyone at the Juku knew the type of life Ranma led, so  explaining this away was simply stating that something magical  happened, and that the entire district was affected. The people who  would 'get involved' to turn things back to normal would, of course,  be his close friends in the Juku. That would not raise any eyebrows,  and everyone would accept the status quo without letting any hints go  about what speculations were.</p><p>The  others were willing to go along and create a long term role-playing  game in which they took the parts of a magical girls support team.  Mix it up a bit and you had something like a science-police team, and  that would be fun. They would know what was happening, and it was  less dangerous than actually being involved in the action.</p><p>Hikaru  stated that he had the perfect place to set up a 'secret base' for  their operations, which they would check over tonight.</p><p>Now,  to think of what to tell Misa so that the gossip queen wouldn't spoil  anything.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki  was being cautious.<p>A  lot of things were going wrong in the area, leaving most people in a  slight state of shock. The exception to this was the class Ranma and  Akane were in as people were accepting it as normal. Then again, of  all the people in the school, they had the most experience with  strange things happening.</p><p>However,  this was not the only thing that was wrong, especially since factors  outside of the school were also contributing to the strange mess that  was Nerima. If it had only affected the  members of the so-called 'Nerima Wrecking Crew', that would be one  thing. After all, given the chaos that had happened in past, with  the various chases, kidnappings, trips, and magical elements, then  she would put it down as something all of the people who were  affected had been involved in.</p><p>When  combined with other things, the people in Nerima were nervous, itchy,  and waiting for the big one.</p><p>Examples  of the changes were numerous:</p><p>1. No  attack helicopters chasing schoolgirl  waitresses</p><p>2. No  reports of Ataru Moroboshi doing something perverted</p><p>3. The  four dorks, as they were known, not causing appreciable damage in  trying to get Lum to notice them.</p><p>4. Tatewaki  Kuno was actually acting like a person instead of someone out of  Samurai literature</p><p>5. Principal  Kuno was acting as a real school administrator instead of a  demented version of a Hawaiian tourist.</p><p>6. No  unusual people entering the district and  making a nuisance of themselves.</p><p>7. There  hadn't been a decent amount of destruction in almost three weeks.</p><p>Entire  industries depended on the destruction and violence that occured in  the district, and various contractors were getting  worried. They had come to her to ask when things would get back to  normal as they would have to close down otherwise. The insurance  people were just the opposite. They had asked if she could do  something to make sure that things were going to stay as it was.</p><p>Too  many things depended on her finding out what was happening.</p><p>Unfortunately,  the targets of her investigations were now intelligent enough so that  they would not just blurt out the first thing that was said, and  Kodachi had been sent on a scholastic trip by her family about a  month and a half before and was not expected back for at least  another three months, so that was out. Her last chance to find out  anything from these people was to go to the estate and find that  servant of theirs, Sasuke.</p><p>If  this didn't work, she was unsure what, or who to try next.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Kinomoto,  a moment of your time please." Captain Isahikawa stated as he  finished the morning meeting.<p>Taya  groaned silently to herself. Here it was, the expected trouble, and  her new assignment. By the various Gods, she was happy to have  placed the order earlier this morning as she was going to need the  stimulus soon. "Yes Captain."</p><p>The  captain led her from the staff room to another part of the building,  "I know this may be sudden, but it has been decided that you  will be promoted to another department in the building."</p><p>"Promoted?"</p><p>"Yes.   You were the officer on scene at yesterday's Class Three incident,  and you know quite a bit of the Class Two's that are in the area, so  you will be joining an elite unit. Ota will report his findings to  you concerning the Class Three matter," The captain stated  calmly. "You will not be demoted after this is over, by the  way. The Central Department has decided to create a command centre  here that you will run after the Class Three has run it's initial  course."</p><p>"Wait  a minute!" Taya exclaimed. "What the fuck do you mean by  the 'initial course'?"</p><p>"Kinomoto,  please watch your language. I may permit it, but as a person being  placed second in command of a unit, and to be transferred to command  within the year, you will have to watch your language more."</p><p>Taya  blushed, "Sorry. I have always been outspoken."</p><p>The  captain nodded. "Understandable. However, your new unit is,  in part, political. You would do well to think before you speak. As  to the 'initial course', command has experience in this, and have  told me that these incidents tend to occur in cycles. Each cycle  ranging from between 6 months to 2 years, and being followed by  several more cycles. Also, the Class Three's may be the first of the  incidents, as it may escalate to a Class Four, or even Five. Your  unit will be in charge of investigation, and to some extent, cover  up. Much as we do now with the Class Two's."</p><p>"Captain,  we do not cover up the Class Two incidents. All we do is follow what  is happening and file a report."</p><p>"True.   However, Class Two's can be explained away to most people, and  hidden from International view easily. Class Three's are a  bit...Sticky. I happen to know since I was on a Class Three team in  the Juban district until 6 months ago. You will have your work cut  out for you, and you will need to make...friends...with any Class  Threes."</p><p>Kinomoto  blinked, and then stared at the captain beside her. "What do  you mean Sir?"</p><p>"In  Juban, the leader of the task force made contact, and and became  friends, with the adventurer known as 'Sailor V'. This was before  the appearance of the numerous 'Senshi'. We were assigned clean up  and reporting duty, as well as investigating anything that was needed  by that team. The things they fight are not within our abilities to  handle at the present time, although research is being conducted into  making the police able to combat these threats. Anyone, at the level  of Captain and above, has been on one of these teams."</p><p>"What!"  Taya hissed to Isahikawa. "You mean every one at Captain or  above has this sort of experience?"</p><p>"Yes.   We also keep an eye on possible replacements. You happen to be one.   Also, you would do well to learn the politics. We cannot have what  happens here in Japan make the major news, one of the reasons that  the Sailor Senshi Manga was created. If it can be written off as  fiction, then others will not pay attention to it, at least on the  international scene. You would also do well to promote a  'reputation'. Officially become a drinker, or develop a side 'hobby'  such as an anime obsession. It helps in your cover, and makes it  look as though you are not really doing anything important. The  force will pick up all the tabs for these 'obsessions'. You will  keep all of these materials, and your pay grade will be increased  150 to make it seem like you have the money to spend on these  hobbies. What you actually do with your pay increase is up to you.</p><p>"I  would suggest moving into a new home for one. The apartment that you  keep is fine, but too small for some of the things that you will  need. You will also keep your real duties a secret, making it look  like we transferred you because you were complaining, and we are  trying to save face. I know you have some knowledge of the duties  involved, but this is a detective's duty, not a public officer  as we make it seem."</p><p>"I...understand...I  guess." Taya replied, surprised at the real  duties of the two she knew.</p><p>"You  will come to understand in time. Remember that you need to have  public face, and a face for the higher ups. If everything goes well,  you will achieve the rank of Captain in another district as soon as  your duties here are complete. That is, unless you want to stay.  Surprisingly, a lot of the people in charge of a unit do not want to  leave until they are sure that everything is relatively normal again.   I chose to leave because I was becoming too well known as showing up  at several of the incidents in the Juban district."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A  lot had changed around Furinken, some of it for the better, some for  the worse. The normal venues of entertainment had all but dried up.  However, one of the more interesting ones was still in existence,  although with a weird, but strangely normal paradigm shift. In this  case, lunch had changed from observing the Akane Vs. Ranma while he  tries to hide from the fiancees battle to Ranma gets wooed by girls  acting like boys. Same people, for the most part, but with a new  dynamic. Given what had happened in past, it was a new, bizarre, and  utterly entertaining soap opera. The only differences were that  Ryouga was the only male of this group contending for Ranma, and  Ranma tended to keep her attention on him, and Shampoo had become the  'best girlfriend' instead of a contender.<p>This  time, however, one of the usual players was missing, not that anyone  who was looking really noticed.</p><p>If  one looked, however, they would have seen Shampoo off to herself in a  little used are of the school yard. If they came close enough, they  would have noticed the stream of tears that was making it's way down  her face. They might not have known what was bothering her, but some  of the girls would have tried to comfort her. Mousse definitely  would have if he wasn't so concerned with keeping an eye on his  'little sister'.</p><p>As  for Shampoo, she wept. All her suffering... all her trials...  for nothing. Ranma wasn't even really a boy. Ranma wasn't her  airen. Ranma was...a warrior from legend. As in the animated  entertainment that was so popular here.</p><p>A  small digression here to explain something. It is to be understood  that the Amazon Nation, with very few exceptions, did not understand  the concept of Fiction. They studied their  history's, and their laws, as well as martial arts. In fact, it had  been so long since anyone had seen any fiction, that youngsters took  anything said as the unedited truth.</p><p>There  were a few exceptions to this rule, and they were mostly among the  ruling counsel. For instance, one of the people who understood  fiction was Cologne. Then again, she had  been imaginative as a child and had traveled a lot when she was  younger.</p><p>In  direct contrast, Shampoo did not  understand. She enjoyed all of the stories on television, what  little she saw of it thanks to the immense amount of studying she had  to do on old potions, history's and various bits of sociology that  her great grandmother forced her to look at, so she took what  television she had seen as gospel. Not exactly  the best thing to do, but she REALLY didn't know any better.</p><p>Thus,  she believed that Sailor Moon- which she had seen an entire three  episodes of- was historically correct.</p><p>Then  it hit her.</p><p>'I  can turn into a cat.'</p><p>'But  not a talking cat.'</p><p>'But  isn't there a potion that can let cats...'</p><p>There  was. True, in the history of the Amazon Alchemical Arts this was  widely regardes as the single most pointless potion of all. You give  a cat a dose of the Talking Cat Potion and what you recieved was a  long babble consisting of a desire for fish, mice, sleep, and a nice  sunny spot.</p><p>But  Shampoo... when a cat... was not your normal cat.</p><p>And  in some fashion...she could be with Ranma.</p><p>Oddly  enough, this was the ONLY Amazon potion that actually WORKED.</p><p>Now,  Shampoo forgot one thing in her amazing ability to  recall this potion. Ranma was scared of cats. This would cause a  problem.</p><p>In  addition, her subconscious, which had provided her with this amazing  revelation had also made another conclusion, one which would cause  even more trouble. If Ranma was a Mystical Warrior, then she needed  a proper adviser, and no proper mystical warrior would be afraid of  their adviser. And the only one who could be a proper adviser to a  warrior woman was one from a village of warrior women.</p><p>She  now knew her destiny.</p><p>She  knew why she had come to this country.</p><p>She  knew the reason behind the curse of Jusenkyo.</p><p>She  knew her duty, and her charge.</p><p>She  could take comfort in making sure that her charge was taken care of,  and that she would find a proper mate.</p><p>If  her charge wouldn't look for a proper mate, or was  too ditsy to find one, then Shampoo would find one. And Ryouga, the  lost boy, would definitely not be on the list. Perhaps Spatu...Ukyou  if she could find any Nanniichuan. Surely that barrel could not be  the last, at least if she was going to fulfill her destiny.</p><p>Now,  she only had to get the right ingredients, and her  great grandmother did have most of them available...</p><p>An  after-school shopping trip seemed advisable for the remaining  ingredients.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ota  grimaced as he got out of the forensics department.<p>Nothing  was making any sense.</p><p>The  robbery from the night before had taken a ruby.</p><p>Not  a large one either.</p><p>The  ruby was only two carats, worth a little less than 300,000 yen as it  was flawed. Why they would attack and take a flawed gem was  something that didn't add up. The previous incident had the crooks,  or beings, escape with more than 300,000,000 yen.</p><p>Then  there were the telltales.</p><p>Although  the area had been cleared, there was no sign of whatever it was that  had caused that girl to choke like that. Some of the people in the  labs had speculated that it was a gas attack, while others stated  that it could have been some kind of micro garrote. The  film that they had copies of was not clear enough to determine what  it was given that it was taken with one of those new digital cameras.</p><p>What  was even stranger was the chemical residue.</p><p>The  previous residue turned out to be old newspapers. Well burned, but  still old newspapers. The chemicals on the plastic, which were  thought to be explosives, were confirmed as newspaper as well.  Unless somehow the newspaper WAS the explosive.</p><p>This  residue was simply mineral oil. A lot of mineral oil.</p><p>How  such a thin layer of mineral oil could coat the street and the walls  of the area was still a puzzle.</p><p>There  was the evidenced of energy blasts, but that was considered normal.</p><p>Unless  the plastic and newspapers made up the body of the previous monster.</p><p>And  the...beings...that looked like people in silly costumes were really  made out of mineral oil.</p><p>That  would fit.</p><p>Especially  with how they were thrown around like in a bad sentai show.</p><p>But  where did the money and the flawed ruby come in?</p><p>And  how the hell did paper parasols with fishing weights come into this?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"It's  the first time I've seen you face to face in over two years."<p>"True,  but I wanted to apologize in person. I didn't believe you when you  told me that a magical girl had interfered in the first acquisition."</p><p>"I  wouldn't have believed it myself, if I hadn't experienced it."</p><p>"What  do we know so far?"</p><p>"She  has far above normal strength. Although she didn't look as though  she was hitting hard, several of our people have large bruises, two  have cracked ribs. The special effects seem to be effective with  her, however. The gas module was a good idea, although I didn't  think we would be using it this soon.</p><p>"Her  bones have to be reinforced somehow, given the height she is able to  drop from. The people in the area didn't run, and seemed to be used  to someone jumping from rooftops. This means that she's been seen  before, and probably will again. The public looked on and just made  comments on the fight, not even taking the time to phone the police.</p><p>"She's  also fast. Gem was able to run through our people, hardly giving  them time to react. It also shows that she could have come from  anywhere in the district given the time constraints."</p><p>"What  do you mean by that?"</p><p>"The  first time, she showed up at fifteen minutes, 22 seconds. This means  that she wasn't really looking for us, and probably heard about the  explosion over a radio or something. The second time, she showed up  at three minutes, 12 seconds, which means she is looking for  incidents."</p><p>"That  may just be an aberration."</p><p>"Perhaps,  but it is more likely she is some sort of special officer. It would  make sense with the local 'legends' of people with extreme abilities.   Perhaps the costume she is wearing is some kind of special body  suit, designed to duplicate, or enhance, special abilities."</p><p>"Possible.   A government project?"</p><p>"That's  what I'm thinking. Her weaknesses seem to run in the unexpected.  The first time was the nitrous oxide/paper mache rocket. This  time it was the gas ball. If we are to continue  here, we'll need more surprises to counter her."</p><p>"What  about her companion?"</p><p>"He  seems to be a backup of some type. Perhaps someone to get her out of  trouble. From what little I've seen it appears that she has amazing  flexibility and gymnastics training. Given the usual training  routines, I doubt he has the same."</p><p>"Suggestions?"</p><p>"If  I'm to face her again, I would recommend at least  two crimes occurring in different areas at the same time. I will  need some help from our special effects department, and some portable  equipment. The police came as the secondary team was leaving the  area with the smoke generators. Also, we will need more people to  pull those injured away. Good padding under the clothes will help as  well, but it can't be bulky."</p><p>"I'll  see to it, and have the planners come up with something. We'll be  keeping in close contact from now on."</p><p>"I'll  see you later then."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The  day had been somewhat long, at least as far as Ryouga was concerned.<p>He  was still embarrassed about the previous night, and what he had to do  to save Ranma's life.</p><p>He  nearly didn't show up in time, and having to give Ranma mouth to  mouth resuscitation was too close to kissing. It had to be done,  however, since she had been choking on something and semi-conscious  at the time. She also hadn't woken up for almost an hour afterwards,  leaving him to watch over her for quite a while.</p><p>He  sighed. This Ranma was just too cute for her own good. When she was  sleeping she seemed relaxed, unlike the Ranma he knew who was always  waiting for an attack. He had left just as she was waking up, giving  a lame line about fighting the good fight.</p><p>He  had dropped down next to the building and removed the tuxedo and  suit. He'd have to thank Mousse for teaching him enough of his  techniques latter, although he was unsure of WHY Mousse wanted to  train with him. Of course, Yuka and Sayuri finding them afterwards  didn't help much. They just went on about how He and Ranma were the  perfect lovebirds.</p><p>Either  he found a way home, went crazy, or started to accept that this was  his life now. All of those options had checks in the plus and minus  columns. And the more he stayed, the more he was starting to accept  this, which wasn't good for his constitution.</p><p>He  also didn't like how this 'butch' Akane was eying him like a piece of  meat that she would love to beat on.</p><p>Then  again, Ranma's mother was a contradiction in herself.</p><p>What  was that line again? Oh yes. 'May you live in interesting times.'  He was definitely cursed with seeing hell. And he couldn't even  blame Ranma for this!</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  rotated her shoulders a bit. It had been a relaxing day, thus far,  and that was good. The fight hadn't done much for her confidence as  she had choked on nothing that could be seen or smelled. She would  need to find the item or items that would help her as she obviously  didn't have enough power to take care of this on her own.<p>Ah  well, she could worry about that latter.</p><p>Tonight,  it was sitting in front of the television and watching her research  materials.</p><p>The  Wedding Peach series.</p><p>To  Be Continued...</p>
