</div>"Where do you want to go, Mom?" Ranma asked as the two of them<p>left the house.<p>Nodoka smiled, and then decided to tease her son a bit. "I thought<p>we'd go downtown and have dinner, and then do some shopping. You have<p>enough boys' clothing for now, and I would like to see my daughter dressed<p>in something better, and acting less like a tomboy."<p>*Yep, my subconscious is really acting up. No way would Mom smile<p>like that and say that I'm her daughter. Guess I must be feeling guilty<p>over the way I treated Mom when I was Ranko, and the fact that I ended up<p>'stealing' the daughter she never had when I finally revealed myself to<p>her. Well, might as well play along. If I remember this, it may make a<p>good scenario for our role-playing games.* Ranma thought to himself. "Can<p>you give me a few minutes then, Mom? I need to go and change."<p>Nodoka blinked at that, especially when Ranma rushed back in the<p>house. Ranma was definitely not acting like himself. She had at least<p>expected some kind of denials that he wasn't her daughter, not her son<p>rushing back in the house to get changed. Of course, it could be that he<p>was tired of denying that he was a girl every day, or he could be doing<p>something to test her resolve. How could Ranma test her by changing into<p>nicer clothing was the thought she had.<p>When Ranma came back down wearing an outfit that Nodoka thought<p>she'd never see on him again, she was shocked. Ranma's hair was down from<p>the pigtail, and redone into a nice ponytail, a small hat on her head,<p>black leggings, mini-skirt, blouse, and vest. She was carrying a small<p>purse, and got a small bottle of water out of the refrigerator. "I'm<p>ready to go, Mom. Hope we can get more outfits like this one."<p>Nodoka blinked slowly and decided to play along. Laying her hand<p>across the girls' shoulder she said, "Of course, daughter. That's much<p>better than what you were wearing before, and I'm glad that you are<p>dropping the tomboy look. It's definitely time you grew up."<p>Ranma smiled as she led the way out of the house, *Well, if I had<p>any doubts before, this ruins them. Mom wanting me as a daughter is<p>crazy, and since she seems to want me as one, might as well have fun with<p>it. If I can force the circumstances of the dream the right way, maybe I<p>can become that 'magical girl' character I'm working on, and get some idea<p>for monsters or something.*<p>Nodoka looked on in wonder from behind Ranma. Maybe she was right<p>and it was the curse that was affecting Ranma. She had felt the bra<p>strap, knowing that her son hated wearing those, even if she needed it at<p>times. Well, maybe it was time to test that theory out, and she had just<p>the store to visit to do so. If her son refused to have anything to do<p>with girls, perhaps it was time to see if her daughter had any problems<p>with...<p>Sexual Endeavours<p>Part Two:<p>What's Good for the Gander...<p>A fan fiction based on Takahashi Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2<p>Saotome Ranma, Saotome Genma, Saotome Nodoka, Tendo Akane, Tendo Soun,<p>Tendo Kasumi, Tendo Nabiki, Kuonji Ukyou, Hibiki Ryouga, P-chan, Shampoo,<p>Shan Pu, Mousse, Mu Si, Cologne, Ke Lun, Kuno Tatewaki, Kuno Kodachi,<p>Tofu-Sensei, and Hinako Sensei are copyright 1987, 2001 by Takahashi<p>Rumiko.<p>Publishing rights: Japan by Shogakukan Inc. Tokyo<p>Hong Kong by Jademan (Holdings) Ltd.<p>North America by Viz Inc.<p>Written by Ichinohei Hitomi<p>Akane sat at the table, hardly moving, and wondering what,<p>exactly, happened at school. It was like an unbelievable dream, a good<p>one where her fiancé, Ranma, was a smart, brilliant man with a mind that<p>rivalled others. There was one problem with the dream theory, however.<p>Akane knew that she had been awake for the surprising show.<p>No one had mentioned it. They were scared to since it might mean<p>that they would be brought into this weirdness, but it had obviously<p>unnerved them. No one was willing to admit to that fear, or try to stop<p>Ranma if he suddenly turned violent. *That wasn't Ranma. It couldn't<p>have been Ranma. Ranma would have tried almost anything to sleep in class<p>or goof off in some manner, not pay attention to the teachers.<p>That...that person was extremely well prepared, giving speeches, knowing<p>mathematics far beyond anything we've been thought, and being fluent in<p>English. Ranma doesn't know English! He hardly knows Japanese, and is<p>much less fluent in Chinese, which is a hell of a lot closer to our<p>language. Could that have been an impostor?*<p>She frowned slightly, still trying to think out everything. *It<p>started on the way to school, without Shampoo showing up. Next Kuno was<p>missing, and it's unlikely he would miss a chance to see me or his<p>'pigtailed girl'. Then Ukyou was nice, not even mentioning the engagement<p>as she usually does, although at the time I assumed it was because of fear<p>of the unknown. Ranma then starts acting as if he was a Juku student<p>instead of his usual 'All I Need To Know Is Martial Arts' attitude. It's<p>as though someone replaced Ranma with a copy, but a flawed one which<p>thought too much and is too intelligent. He has to be an impostor, but if<p>this person is an impostor, where is the real Ranma?*<p>*Perhaps the better question to ask is who could have replaced<p>Ranma with this...person.* Akane thought as she began to build a list of<p>names in her head which included Shampoo, Cologne, Happousai, or any<p>number of others. Of course, it included Kodachi and excluded Tatewaki,<p>but then again, Kodachi was the intelligent one.<p>"I've been hearing weird things about Ranma since after school,<p>Akane. Want to tell me what it is about, and who the new challenger is?"<p>Nabiki drawled as she came to sit at the table.<p>Akane gasped and blinked rapidly. She was so caught up in<p>thinking of what may have happened that she never noticed her sister come<p>home. "The person who was in class wasn't Ranma, at least I don't think<p>so. It had to be an impostor of some kind."<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow, "Someone who could impersonate Ranma?<p>Do you know how unlikely that sounds?"<p>"I know what it sounds like, Nabiki," Akane continued, "But how<p>else can you explain Ranma knowing English, Mathematics, giving well<p>thought out speeches, and not fighting."<p>Akane's eyes widened, "Not fighting...That person didn't get into<p>one fight today, he didn't insult me, he didn't even make a wrong,<p>pigheaded, or condescending comment to anyone all day!"<p>Nabiki spit out her tea. Ranma, not stick his foot in his mouth<p>at least once for the entire day? "Akane, that's impossible. Ranma may<p>be an upstanding young man, but he's a thoughtless, slightly idiotic,<p>upstanding young man."<p>"Nabiki, I need you to find out if Ranma has been kidnapped, and<p>if he has, who did it. If that was Ranma, it wasn't the Ranma we know and<p>it could just be some passing weirdness. If it wasn't Ranma, then we need<p>to go rescue him."<p>Nabiki frowned. It seems some of the rumours were true, at least<p>of a Ranma that was acting extremely odd from what everyone knew about<p>him. First his mother wants to know about Ranma's seeming inability to<p>have a normal male mind concerning sex. Now Akane thinks Ranma is too<p>kind, considerate, and intelligent to be himself. The next thing she knew<p>people would be telling her that the big lug had more potential to earn an<p>income than her! "I'll look into it, for free. If this isn't Ranma, then<p>my biggest source of income has flown out the window, and I want him<p>back."<p>Akane smiled, "Let's see if he's in his room."<p>"She's not home, Akane." Kasumi said as she came into the room<p>with some more tea. "She got dressed and went out with her mother for<p>diner and to go shopping."<p>Both of Soun's younger daughters boggled at this thought. Ranma,<p>willing to go shopping with his mother? The man who hated to be in any<p>store longer than five minutes?<p>"What was she wearing?" Asked Nabiki slowly.<p>"Oh, that nice mini-skirt outfit Aunt Nodoka bought for her a<p>while back. You know the one Akane, it was when you both outgrew your<p>bra's and had to look for new ones."<p>Akane gasped upon breathing in tea the wrong way, and looked at<p>Nabiki, "I don't think I'll be around for supper this evening."<p>Nabiki nodded slightly, "Neither will I. There is something that I<p>need to do."<p>Both girls tried to be casual about it, but as soon as they got to<p>the street they started running. Ranma, going with his mother dressed as<p>a girl? It had to be an impostor, or a magical clone, or something. It<p>might even have been a case of some demon possessing the boy, and they had<p>to find out.<p>Kasumi blinked as she picked up the teacups her sisters left<p>behind, "I hope that wasn't because of something I said."<p>***<p>Mousse was grumbling from the roof of the Nekohanten. He had<p>learned, from observation, that Ranma was not one to annoy past a certain<p>point. Of course, if he had known what Ranma was able to do, that he was<p>able to defeat a Pheonix by killing it's body, then he would never have<p>originally challenged him. Ranma was power incarnate.<p>He thought back to seeing a human, one who did not have any Divine<p>Lineage, Dragon Blood, or Pheonix Infusion, take on an immortal who was<p>considered a God and win. There were other 'Pheonix', the lesser birds<p>who did not have the powers of rebirth, but for one to take on a being who<p>could incinerate the planet and win was beyond comprehension. In an<p>earlier age, Saotome Ranma would have been considered a God, or a<p>Demi-God, such as Herakles had been.<p>To have been fighting such power in his pursuit of Shan Pu...<p>Shuddering would have been too easy to contemplate.<p>Looking down at the street, he stared, took off his glasses,<p>cleaned them, put them back on, and stared again.<p>He was seeing things. He had to have been. Perhaps it was time<p>to see an eye doctor in this country, get some new glasses or perhaps<p>those contact lenses he had heard about, if they did not interfere with<p>his curse. Yes, a new lighter, and much more flattering pair of glasses<p>would be the best thing he could do for himself, instead of these that<p>were provided by those Canadian aid workers. Perhaps that way illusions,<p>such as what he saw below, could be forever banished.<p>After all, he knew of Genma's 'Man Among Men' promise and what it<p>would mean, so there was no way that he was seeing Ranma, of all people,<p>female, dressed as a very modern young girl in a miniskirt, with his<p>mother, who would more than likely take his head if he appeared that way.<p>Dropping into the alley behind the Nekohanten, Mousse looked at<p>the building. *No, not tonight. I can't put up with the usual crap to<p>prove myself to a woman who has no idea what love really is. Stupid laws.<p>They're so damned outdated and illogical. Why can't those hidebound old<p>women become a part of this century. I've got to get away for a while,<p>anywhere to forget what's been happening. The bar would be the best place<p>to go for now.*<p>The young Master of Hidden Weapons left, expecting to spend a few<p>thousand, perhaps as much as one hundred thousand, yen on a good tasting<p>liquor, with as high an alcohol content as was possible.<p>***<p>Ryouga looked at the sign in front of him, blinked, checked the<p>GPS unit once more, and sighed.<p>"Figures," he muttered, depressed. "When I want to find Akari's,<p>I end up at the Dojo. Even this technological wonder can't help my sense<p>of direction."<p>Ryouga opened the gate and went in, deciding that since he was in<p>the neighbourhood, he might as well stop by and say hello. Maybe Ranma<p>could help him figure out what was wrong, since he bought the unit.<p>Perhaps he input the wrong co-ordinates or something, since he and Ranma<p>had gone around writing down all the places Ryouga considered important,<p>such as his home, the Dojo, Akari's, and the school. Ryouga confirmed the<p>co-ordinates himself, so it was the only explanation.<p>He knocked on the door frame before entering, "Hello, is anyone<p>home?"<p>Kasumi came out of the kitchen, "Oh, hello Ryouga-kun, no one is<p>home at the moment, but if you would like to wait, I can prepare some<p>tea."<p>Ryouga smiled. Kasumi was always so nice to everyone, to the<p>point where people thought that she was absolutely clueless to what<p>happened around her. Of course, having spent so much time around the<p>Dojo, he knew differently, "Thank-you Kasumi, I would appreciate that."<p>While he was waiting, he decided to look at the co-ordinate on the<p>GPS and compare it to the written co-ordinates he had. The co-ordinates<p>for Akari's matched, so he looked at the unit, wondering if it could be<p>broken. Since there was no obvious damage, he tried inputting other<p>co-ordinates, such as Ukyou's or the Nekohanten. All of them said that he<p>had arrived.<p>"The Deities must hate me." Ryouga said as he looked at the unit<p>which had been his hope of actually getting places. "Either that, or<p>someone, somewhere, is trying to tell me something."<p>"What was that Ryouga-kun?"<p>Ryouga clutched at his chest for a second. Damn she was quiet<p>when she wanted to be. "Nothing Kasumi, do you know where Ranma went?"<p>Kasumi smiled pleasantly, "Ranma-chan went out with her mother,<p>they should be back after their shopping trip, since both of them were<p>talking about getting some new outfits so she wouldn't be much of a tomboy<p>anymore."<p>Ryouga sipped his tea slowly, trying not to panic. His sense of<p>direction really did it this time, he was in another universe, one without<p>the GPS satellites in orbit. It was the only explanation for Ranma going<p>shopping with _HER_ mother in order to become less of a tomboy...<p>***<p>If it had been in character, Ranma would have laughed long and<p>loud at the sight of the store her mother wanted to shop in. Ok, she was<p>only thinking of putting in something like this, although it was a little<p>bit perverted, but for her dreams to pursue this. Well, she was used to<p>unusual dreams, and it may also give her some ideas for the second, hidden<p>story, not that she would tell the others until it was ready for the final<p>compile.<p>Shaking her head a little, and desperately keeping a smile from<p>her face, Ranma followed her mother into the most unusual store she would<p>ever go into.<p>"Ranma-chan, now that you are a young woman, I think it's time we<p>get you something for when you get married, and to help you out when your<p>husband ignores you." Nodoka said, a small smile on her lips. If she was<p>wrong about her daughter, her sons deception would be exposed. Either<p>way, she would get what she wanted in the end. Grandchildren.<p>"Mother," Ranma began, "Are you sure we should go in there with so<p>many people around?"<p>"Are you afraid of going in Ranma?"<p>Ok, how to play this, the bold, full of life woman who thinks<p>nothing of sex, or the shy, demure, girl who her mother would be shocked<p>if she went in willingly. Well, her character was supposed to be a nice<p>girl, so..."Well, a little bit. I mean the classes at school were<p>embarrassing, and to enter so brazenly...It's unseemly for a young woman."<p>Nodoka blinked, then blinked again. Ranma, her child, admitting<p>fear? "It will be all right. Besides, it's better than coming in here<p>with your boyfriend."<p>Ranma giggled, "I suppose you're right, Mom. I can just imagine<p>what he'd think of me."<p>Nodoka was slightly shocked at that admission. *Perhaps I should<p>think of changing the engagement, if I can find the boy that my daughter<p>likes. Otherwise, I could just open it up and see which boy...person, can<p>win my daughters heart. It may not be wise to engage her to the first boy<p>that catches her eye.*<p>***<p>Around the corner from the store, both Akane's and Nabiki's eyes<p>were wide open in shock. They still couldn't believe what they heard, and<p>it was obvious that Ranma's mother believed that she was a girl. Still,<p>Ranma, their Ranma, _HAD_ _A_ _BOYFRIEND_!<p>"I want his name Nabiki. I want to know who the pervert is that<p>is taking advantage of _MY_ Ranma-chan!" Akane growled out. "Forget the<p>impostor bit, if Ranma is thinking of having a boyfriend, it has to be<p>some kind of magic potion or something. Like the time Ryouga wanted<p>Ranma, or perhaps like Kuno's wishing sword. Either way, I _will_ _kill_<p>the pervert, and you're going to help me!"<p>Nabiki could only nod, although she didn't really hear what she<p>was agreeing to. *Masaka! It has to be the curse, or Ranma's father<p>really screwed up his mind. Given what his father put him through, it's<p>probably the later. What kind of horror, or hell, did he put his child<p>through? Could he have molested Ranma in some way to cause this and his<p>girl form is really part of a separate personality?*<p>"I'm going to find the pervert. Let's see. The possibilities are<p>Happousai, Kuno, Ryouga, that damned kissing pervert who skates, the guys<p>who tried to marry Ranma, or perhaps someone new. I don't care how long<p>it takes, I'll kill him for trying to take _MY_ Ranma away from me."<p>Akane continued to grumble, wanting more than anything to see what Ranma<p>was up to in that sex shop.<p>Nabiki shook her head to clear it. She had to find out exactly<p>what was happening, not only for Nodoka's sake, or Ranma's, but for the<p>peace of Nerima. If this was learned, by anyone, the whole district could<p>go up in flames as angry fiancés tried to interrogate innocent boys. If<p>that happened, all bets were off as far as the government was concerned.<p>If Akane learned of...<p>Nabiki winced, as she finally heard what Akane was saying.<p>*Perhaps the best thing to hope for is some damage control...*<p>***<p>Ranma looked around, and kept her eyes shinning as though she was<p>a five year old in a candy store. She had seen most of this stuff before,<p>hell, thanks to Nabiki's picture sessions, she had more lingerie and<p>intimate apparel than most girls. The first rack she went to were of some<p>delicate sets of almost see through intimates, and decided to play her<p>role to the hilt. "Mom, can I have a few of these?"<p>"Well, daughter, we'll look those over after we see what's in this<p>cabinet." Nodoka replied, indicating a display case.<p>Ranma looked at what was inside and almost lost control. "Those<p>are...large, Mom. Are they sculptures of some kind?"<p>"No dear, they are meant to be used by a girl when her husband is<p>away."<p>Ranma looked again, "Are you sure? I mean, the size of those, I<p>don't think they'd fit."<p>Nodoka's eyebrows raised. Admittedly she pointed out devices that<p>were very large, but for her daughter to even indicate that they were too<p>large told her that she was no longer a virgin. She'd definitely have to<p>look for the boy Ranma wanted to marry, "Well, our bodies can accommodate<p>more than you would think daughter. How about I choose one for you to use<p>whenever you are feeling a bit needy?"<p>"Ok," Ranma replied, indicating the rear of the store. "I want to<p>see what's back there."<p>Curious herself, Nodoka followed her daughter, and saw what was in<p>back. Well, if her daughter was a lady, she wouldn't want any of this.<p>In fact, it would limit the number of men that her daughter could find as<p>a mate.<p>Ranma looked on at all of the leather armour hanging on the walls.<p>Chest plates, skirts, face masks, just what a magical girl needed. In<p>fact, she could use this as a place where magical girls went to get their<p>uniforms and costumes made! "Mom, can I get some of this?"<p>Nodoka almost fainted at hearing those words. "O..of course, dear.<p>We just need to make sure they fit correctly."<p>Ranma wasted little time in cornering a salesperson, and striping<p>down to her panties and bra in order to get a custom made set of armour.<p>Looking around, she began to get some ideas of what she wanted, such as<p>that one piece bit of armour that would be something like a swimsuit, the<p>boots would be a nice addition, but without those thin, high heels, maybe<p>some lower, wider heels, and a wider area for her toes, and a split<p>leather skirt would be good. Soon, she was in full discussion with the<p>sales person about what she wanted, and the possibilities involved, such<p>as gloves, mask, whips, chains, etc.<p>Nodoka just stood there, until she decided to head back to the<p>outer section of the store, going towards the magazine racks. *Books. I<p>need books and information on this...lifestyle my daughter has chosen.<p>Maybe then I can figure out which one of the boys she knows likes her like<p>this, and I can set a meeting with his parents. To imagine, my daughter<p>likes to control men like that! At least this way she won't make the same<p>mistakes I did with Genma.*<p>***<p>Ukyou was worried. Not that was anything new, considering she ran<p>her own business, went to school, participated in various adventures, and<p>was beginning to get an idea of what life could be like when she married<p>Ranma. Then again, she wasn't usually worried about the man she loved,<p>since he was so buff, and tight, and looked so...<p>She faded off into a small fantasy, one that had become more<p>frequent in the past few weeks. While she had originally been fantasizing<p>about Ranma as a husband, taking care of the children as she made money,<p>or less often, sharing the lifestyle of a travelling chef, recent events<p>had her thinking along the lines of how he'd be in bed, or if Ranma's girl<p>form would scream when...extremely excited. While Ukyou did think of<p>Ranma as a boy, some of the time, she had easily recognized that being<p>legally male, and Ranma's penchant for water, that having a wife would<p>actually be a good thing. And it provided so many wonderful and<p>entertaining possibilities as well.<p>Shaking off her thoughts, at least on how well she could satisfy<p>her eventual wife in bed, Ukyou started to think about what happened at<p>school. While Ranma was her friend, and hopefully, her life mate, the<p>life he led was stranger than most in Japan could ever hope to match, and<p>what happened today was, to her, an indicator that Ranma was just about<p>ready to leave Nerima, possibly for good. Being the only one who actually<p>listened to Ranma most of the time, barring her fits of jealousy, she<p>already knew Ranma was hiding a lot.<p>Like most, she had assumed that Ranma was hiding his fighting<p>prowess, and using all of the battles with Happousai, Cologne, Kuno,<p>Ryouga, and the rest as a way of improving his martial arts. Then again,<p>Ranma's mind was like a high end government computer, dedicated only to<p>battle. She had probably been the only one in English to notice that<p>Ranma had given a definition that was not in their standard translation<p>dictionary, and it wasn't until computer class that she managed to read<p>the definition in the rear of the programming manual. Ranma wasn't really<p>hiding his abilities in battle, although that seemed to be a good excuse,<p>he was hiding his abilities in being a very good student.<p>Thinking about it a lot, it made more sense than most people would<p>imagine.<p>First, Ranma's life with his father hardly concentrated on<p>academics, especially with his travelling all the time. English, being<p>recognized as one of the International languages important to know, he<p>would naturally have picked it up. Passing grades in English would be<p>impossible, unless he was hiding how good he was, and being able to read<p>in many languages would be an asset, especially since many of the more<p>unusual techniques were written in various languages, including codes that<p>were designed only for use by people who knew that school of the art.<p>This being the case, Ranma would be very familiar with cryptography, and<p>cryptographic notation, and thus mathematics. To understand situations no<p>matter where he travelled in the world, a good understanding of geography<p>and sociology would be required. For people not to have realized that<p>Ranma would have been held back by several grades if he wasn't very<p>intelligent meant he had done a significant amount of acting, and knew<p>people better than anyone else would believe. *But why keep the<p>engagements up in the air?"<p>Thinking about that for a little while, she realized that Ranma<p>was keeping the engagements floating for two good reasons. The first<p>being honour, not his honour, but everyone else's. If he chose a fiancé<p>out of the many people after him, then Ranma would be ruining the honour<p>of others. She remembered Ranma telling her about how the famous 'eating'<p>competition had happened, and what it had meant for others.<p>The second reason she could figure out was because he was not<p>ready to get married yet.<p>Ranma did not go out on dates, in fact he avoided them, trying not<p>to hurt others feelings. The only times she knew of that Ranma had agreed<p>to dating had been because someone had dangled a possible 'cure' in front<p>of his face. However, it made little sense since Ranma used his female<p>form just as often as his male form, and was also comfortable with it.<p>Most of the time, he seemed to be looking for cure for the others than for<p>himself.<p>*If Ranma is ready to go somewhere else, the best thing I can do<p>is talk to Aunt Saotome, and ask her to send Ranma, as a girl, to a<p>private school where she can become a scientist or teacher. Hell, Ranma<p>could probably pass the Juken easily at the moment, so it would probably<p>be a matter of polishing her skills at a good private school. A good<p>private _boarding_ school, with me being her room mate. That way, I can<p>get her to relax a bit, not have to push the engagement so much, and<p>eventually seduce my future wife! It's the perfect plan!*<p>***<p>Nodoka paid for everything that Ranma wanted, from the barely<p>there sleep wear, to the leather outfits which would have to be picked up<p>at a later date. She had also included several items for her daughter<p>that she had also picked up, such as what they were looking at before, and<p>several books for herself. From what she had already read, it could be<p>any number of the boys that she knew of. *That Tatewaki boy seems to be a<p>likely candidate since he likes to be hurt by Ranma, thinking it's her way<p>of showing love. Then again, Ryouga-kun is also a likely possibility,<p>since he does like fighting Ranma a lot, and that he also tried to get her<p>by magic. Mu Si could also be a possibility because of his culture, and<p>the fact that he loses so often, although Ukyou-chan's waitress may be a<p>possibility because she enjoys being a very submissive young lady instead<p>of a boy. And it may be someone I don't know about.*<p>"Mom, are you ok?" Ranma asked, as she looked at her mother.<p>"Yes, Ranma-chan. Why do you ask?" Nodoka replied while looking<p>at her daughter with new understanding.<p>"Because you looked spaced out for a moment." Ranma said. "Is<p>there something wrong?"<p>"No dear, I was just thinking about how you would look in your new<p>leather outfit."<p>"Yeah! It's great isn't it?" Ranma exclaimed enthusiastically as<p>she started towards the door. "Who would have guessed they dressed people<p>in those costumes? Now I know where to get what ever I want when I need<p>to fight anybody!"<p>Nodoka almost fell on her face at that statement. *I'm going to<p>have to make sure I find that boy who took my baby's virginity, and have<p>him marry her, or open up the competition to anyone who can get her to the<p>alter. I am _not_ going to have a daughter that wants to greet every<p>person she meets in _that_ outfit, especially in public. It's already bad<p>enough that she had a specific idea of what she wanted, Ranma will not be<p>a girl of loose morals!*<p>***<p>Akane glared as she watched Ranma leave the store, several bags in<p>her hand, as well as those bags in Aunt Nodoka's hand. She already knew<p>that Ranma's mother was a bit of a pervert, especially with her trying to<p>get Ranma to 'peek' into girls windows. For her to have brought Ranma<p>here, was just more proof that she needed to get him out of her hands.<p>*After I find that pervert who's trying to steal Ranma, I am making _sure_<p>we move and Aunt Nodoka is far away from us. A private boarding school<p>will do, and then I can show Ranma how a person shows love, in the<p>_proper_ way. I will _not_ have _my_ fiancé lusting after boys!*<p>"Akane, calm down and think for a little while. You can't just go<p>around trying to kill every boy you meet. We have to be cautious and<p>careful, and then get the boy and talk to him. It will be a lot worse if<p>you just go off and try to kill him for something that he probably has no<p>idea about." Nabiki stated while laying a hand on her sisters shoulder.<p>"Ranma could just have had a hard knock to the head, or it could be<p>her...his way of coping with the curse."<p>Akane grunted, and tried to think rationally about it. "You're<p>right Nabiki, I'll keep my cool, and since you know more about being<p>sneaky, I'll let you find the pervert. Just let me know who it is, and<p>help me come up with a way to keep Ranma for myself."<p>It was the best she could hope for, for now. "I promise little<p>sister. I will find the boy Ranma's been seeing, and I will tell you who<p>he is."<p>Akane however, was thinking a little bit differently. She had<p>promised not to go after the perverts who could be the ones after Ranma,<p>but she did not promise not to tell Shampoo and Ukyou. Nor did she<p>promise not to tell Kodachi, if she could convince her that 'the pig<p>tailed girl' and Ranma were one and the same. *If I can't confront the<p>pervert, and beat him up, I'm sure the others would only be too glad to do<p>so. They may be competition, but they are the _proper_ competition,<p>unlike any of those pervert boys!*<p>"Let's go home Akane, I don't think it would be a good idea to be<p>following her like this, she may get suspicious." Nabiki said while<p>sighing in relief. With Akane agreeing to let her handle the situation,<p>things were not as desperate as they might get. She was not willing to<p>see Nerima's death toll take a sudden sharp climb while her little sister<p>'investigated' matters herself.<p>***<p>In a nearby mansion, a phone rang, and the man sitting at the desk<p>answered it. When he heard what his informant told him, he knew that, at<p>least for the next few weeks, his actions and those who were closest to<p>him, had to change. In a way, the call was not unexpected, given the<p>confusion in Nerima, but he had hoped his hobbies would last a little<p>while longer. Pressing a button, he turned to the revealed monitors along<p>one wall, and searched for the various occupants of the estate. Finding<p>the people he wanted, he summoned them to his office, despite their<p>protests.<p>Yes, someone was out there, dangerous to him and the people he<p>knew. He did have his suspicions, especially given the way people were<p>talking. However, now was not the time for what could easily be handled<p>later. He had time, and that was to his advantage.<p>***<p>Ryouga was still smiling, and drinking more tea. Tempting as it<p>was to run away, as far away as he could get, he knew he couldn't risk it.<p>If he had, somehow, ended up in another world, then this place was the<p>only possibility of getting home. Given that, he was unsurprised as Ranma<p>walked in, looking very pretty. He was not, however, prepared for what<p>was about to happen.<p>"Ryouga-kun! You're back! Where were you? Have you eaten? Any<p>new adventures to talk about?" Ranma exclaimed cutely and<p>enthusiastically.<p>Ryouga laughed a bit nervously, "Hi Ranma-chan. You're as bubbly<p>as ever."<p>Ranma was having fun with this dream. Ryouga being a friend,<p>without their usual sparing was something that could be said to have never<p>happened. Now, how to make this really fun. "At least you're back in<p>time for our date tomorrow!"<p>Nodoka raised an eyebrow at this, and narrowed her eyes at the<p>boy. *Is he the one?*<p>Ryouga laughed a little more nervously. Kami! In this world he<p>was Ranma's boyfriend, and from the look Nodoka was giving him, one who<p>still had to prove himself! "Well, I did try to make it back as fast as<p>possible, Ranma-chan."<p>Giggling, more as a way of stopping herself from bursting out<p>laughing, Ranma gestured to her bags, "I was just shopping, and I've got<p>to show you what we bought. Wait until you see them on me!"<p>At this point Nodoka stepped in. Ryouga was definitely suspect in<p>having sex with her daughter. "Perhaps after your date tomorrow dear.<p>Right now, I need to talk with Ryouga for a little while. Go and put away<p>your new clothes and items, and I'll talk with you later."<p>"Ok, mom." Well, at least her subconscious wasn't being that<p>perverted. Her mother stepped in at exactly the right time to prevent<p>everything becoming x-rated.<p>Ryouga nervously watched Ranma leave the room, and then gulped at<p>the contained fury on Nodoka's face. "Ehhhh, what do you want to talk<p>about, Saotome-sama?"<p>"Walk with me for a while, young man. I believe we have much to<p>discuss." Nodoka said coldly.<p>Gulping, Ryouga followed Nodoka out of the house, and hoped that<p>she was not going to take his life. What kind of cad was the Ryouga of<p>this universe?<p>"Ryouga-kun, I need to know if you love my daughter." Nodoka<p>stated, as they walked out of the gate.<p>"I...Well...She is a good friend, and I do enjoy being with her.<p>I'm just not sure we're ready for marriage as of yet," he stated<p>nervously, "We're still in school, and well, I need to find out if I can<p>take care of her properly."<p>Nodoka nodded, it seemed the boy was honourable enough, and was<p>looking towards the future. "So, will I have to search for you, or will<p>my daughter be disappointed when you fail to show up _again_."<p>Ryouga gulped hard. This was not going the way he wanted, and he<p>was definitely not enjoying this confrontation. His counterpart sounded<p>like he had disappointed his girlfriend several times, and her mother was<p>getting tired of it. In a way, it was a not so subtle warning that if her<p>daughter was not satisfied in every way possible, then he would face her<p>wrath, probably at the end of her katana. If this is what the Genma in<p>his universe had to face, then it was no wonder he took off with Ranma for<p>over ten years. She was scary! "Ahhh...I was thinking of staying at the<p>dojo for the night, that way I can be ready. The problem is I don't<p>really have a formal outfit to wear in order to take her out tomorrow."<p>"Well, we'll just have to solve that problem. Of course, I'll<p>expect you to take her out to a nice place for dinner, and to show her a<p>good time. Just not _TOO_ good a time." Nodoka stated, looking the boy<p>in the eye. "When we get back, you are _going_ to be on your best<p>behaviour, is that clear Ryouga-kun?"<p>Ryouga gulped again. Ok, not in every way possible. Then again,<p>avoiding the possibility of having sex with Ranma was fine with him, even<p>if this Ranma was a girl and sexually active with his counterpart, which<p>was likely given the stare he was getting. "Perfectly, Saotome-sama."<p>***<p>*Oh shit!* Nabiki thought to herself, as she looked at Akane who<p>was glowing with a very bright aura. *If Ryouga is dating Ranma, he'll be<p>killed if Akane gets a hold of him.*<p>*I'll kill him. I'll make him sorry he ever came here. He'll<p>look nice skinned, and after I make sure that he painfully loses what all<p>perverts seem to think with. To think that I thought Ryouga was a nice<p>guy, but it seems he _still_ hasn't given up on getting Ranma for<p>himself.* The youngest Tendo seethed.<p>"Calm down Akane, you know how things tend to get blown out of<p>proportion around here. With how Aunt Saotome was reacting, it's possible<p>she just jumped to conclusions and trapped him into it. After all, when<p>has he ever gone after a girl without having a major case of nerves!"<p>Nabiki said nervously, not willing to see the damage the eventual fight<p>would cause. "I'll find out for sure, just keep calm.<p>"I'll keep calm, Nabiki," Akane stated, letting her aura flare<p>out. *But as soon as I tell the others, it will be open season on Hibiki,<p>and he's going to wish that he never tried to get Ranma by Magic, just<p>like last time. The best part is, there is no way this can be blamed on<p>me when the others kill him.*<p>To Be Continued...
