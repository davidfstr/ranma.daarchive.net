</div>The streets were fairly quiet.<p>An unusual situation for Nerima which was more used to explosions, ordinance, loud voices coming from an attack helliocoptor, or just plan crazy antics of people going over rooftops and travelling at insane rates of speed as they tore up streets and property.<p>The only thing really heard was the grumbling of a person who was looking at everything in an alley, trying to find out where her quarry was.<p>Of course, her quarry wasn't the usual find a boy and stop him from dating some girl.<p>Well, ok it was, but in this situation it wasn't because it was a situation where she didn't want one of them to date her fiancee.<p>All right, all right. It was exactly that situation, but not in the usual manner.<p>In this case, the young woman, very much dressed as a man in a pair of black pants and chinese top , (because they were the only boys clothes in the house that would even get close to fitting her), was there to prevent her GIRLFRIEND from going out with a guy.<p>In this district, it was known that you do not cross this girl. Not because of her temper, people had gotten used to that in the past year. Not because she was a martial artist, because her family, and the people around them were martial artists. You did not cross Tendo Akane because if you even hinted that something was going on that she didn't like you were going to go to a clinic or to the hospital.<p>And not in a nice manner either.<p>At this time, Akane was angry, although that might have been an understatement.<p>And instead of her usual target, a young man named Saotome Ranma, she was there to find, and quite possibly beat up, one Hibiki Ryouga, who had a date with the afore mentioned Saotome Ranma.<p>Now least anyone think otherwise, neither Saotome Ranma or Hibiki Ryouga were gay.<p>Everyone at furinkan high school had thought of them as the manliest of men, and most girls in the school would be more than willing to date either one.<p>Well, at least until earlier that day.<p>You see, Ranma had this little problem, He turned into a girl.<p>And Akane found out that Ryouga has obviously been dating Ranma without anyone knowing about it.<p>Now, Akane was already rumoured to be a lesbian, but considering she started to dress as a man that day, and was obviously pursuing a female Ranma, well, things were getting a little out of hand.<p>And that's why, Tendo Akane was looking in an alley for her female fiance.<p>Nerimaitis had struck again.<p>Akane pounded the wall next to her, angry at losing sight of the hentai and her girlfriend. "When I get hold of that bastard, he won't be able to produce any more heirs. The world does NOT need more lost and perverted martial artists."<p>For now, the thing was to find Ranma, and not let her get carried away in her current state of mind.<p>Who knew what would happened with Ryouga there?<p>Who knew how far she would be tempted?<p>Who knew just how far would Ranma go in her...<p>Sexual Endeavours<p>Part Five:<p>But there's just one thing,<p>And I really wanna know,<p>Who's that...<p>A fan fiction based on Takahashi Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2<p>Saotome Ranma, Saotome Genma, Saotome Nodoka, Tendo Akane, Tendo Soun, Tendo Kasumi, Tendo Nabiki, Kuonji Ukyou, Hibiki Ryouga, P-chan, Shampoo, Shan Pu, Mousse, Mu Tsu, Cologne, Ku Lon, Kuno Tatewaki, Kuno Kodachi, Tofu-Sensei, and Hinako Sensei are copyright 1987, 2002 by Takahashi Rumiko.<p>Edited by Digital Civilization Multimedia Productions Group Inc.<p>Publishing rights: Japan by Shogakukan Inc. Tokyo<p>Hong Kong by Jademan (Holdings) Ltd.<p>North America by Viz Inc.<p>Written by Ichinohei Hitomi<p>With help from Robert Haynie and the people on #Akane<p>The men were startled by what they were seeing.<p>It was impossible. It couldn't be real because they were just Manga and Anime. A person like that just could not exist.<p>And yet, they had seen it.<p>A girl, a short, busty, redheaded girl in a tight and sexy leather outfit had just fallen three stories in stilleto heels and she didn't crack the sidewalk. A girl, who called herself Gem, and was obviously going to beat the hell out of them for robbing a bank. A girl, who's eyes were glowing behind that mask.<p>At that point, her hands also started glowing, and with a shout of "GEMS...LIGHT!", a bright blue beam erupted from her hands and knocked one of the people down, and incidentally, out.<p>"Shit! Run!" someone shouted.<p>As far as Maruyama Tsuneyo was concerned, it was the right thing to do, and since he was closest to the bank, he ran back in, only to see the person in charge of this operation. "Boss, we got trouble, you don't want to go out there."<p>The man dressed in a dark clothing with a grey jacket, a monicle, and a heavy cape with a gold chain around his neck, looked at his subordinate. "Are the police here?"<p>"No boss, a Magical girl is!"<p>The villain stared at his subordinate. "Let me get this straight. A magical girl. An actual maho shojo. Sexy outfit and incredible leaps and everything."<p>"Yes, sir."<p>"And she even had an energy blast."<p>"Yes, sir."<p>He sighed. "Well, at least I'm dressed for the occaision too."<p>Looking outside, he said, "Start the special effects, I'm heading for the roof."<p>Maruyama gulped, and pulled the remote from his pocket. He hoped the automatic computer controls worked as well as the IT people claimed it would.<p>***<p>"Damn, she's good!" Ryouga mumurred under his breath as he looked on from a rooftop. He couldn't believe how scared she had the crooks, then again, the Ranma he knew would also have the crooks on the run, just not like this. It was almost poetic the way she was blasting them!<p>That was when he looked to the side, and saw...<p>It wasn't possible. HOW could that thing get here without them seeing it?<p>As he watched a figure appeared out of a mist. "So, a little heroine. You should go home little girl, my affairs are none of your business."<p>Ryouga growled as he readied a weapon.<p>***<p>Gem turned and gasped. A three story dragon, waving it's tail, and sending a stream of foul smelling smoke down to the street looked directly at her. The problem was she couldn't sense it! It was there, but there wasn't any chi! She started to back away.<p>"Ah...so the little girl is scared of my pet. Run, and you will not be harmed. Attack, and then I have no choice but to let him go." Said the man in the grey suit and cape.<p>Gem shuddered, wondering at what sort of horror would not even have a trace of life in it. This had to be the person screwing with her family. "I am GEM! I will not allow you to harm the people of this district! You will pay!"<p>"No, it doesn't work that way little girl," the man said as he noted his gang getting away and taking the unconcious with them. "If you attack me, then there is nothing to hold my pet, and the others that I have, away from the populance."<p>Gem growled, and her eyes lit up further behind her mask. There had to be something. Anything she could do.<p>Suddenly, the boss's head was hit by something small and he went down. Before she could do anything, the dragon roared, and a voice from the rooftop shouted, "Now Gem! Strike!"<p>Gem didn't waste time, and shouted her attack...which went right through the beast. Then it roared again, and something came out from the mouth and struck her, hard, and for some reason it was becoming very dark...<p>***<p>Ryouga looked down and leapt to Gem as she collapsed. From his angle, he saw something coming from near the things mouth, and it struck her hard. He had to get her away in order to make sure she was fine. The enemy could get away for now, but Ranma had to be kept alive. Nodoka would kill him if her daughter had a scratch on her.<p>***<p>Gem groaned a bit as she was being carried over the rooftops in the somebodies arms. Strong, arms, that were very comfortable at the moment. It was like when she was being carried to bed as a child, and it was nice. Not really conscience of her actions, she leaned into the body more, just wanting to sleep for a little while.<p>Too soon the arms placed he down, and a voice called out, "Ranma, are you all right? Ranma? RANMA!"<p>Gem woke up fully, and looked into the eyes of the person who got her out of there. A handsome person who wore a mask, had a wide brimed, black hat on, and a cape. "Who..."<p>"You can call me Z, Gem. I'm glad you're all-right, but I think your boyfriend is looking for you. He's close by, just look for him."<p>The man leapt down to the street before Gem could completely get her wits. Once she did, she said, "Oh my God...I have a protector...What the hell happened to my world?"<p>***<p>"You're going to be OK boss, but whatever happened left a bump on your head."<p>The boss groaned. "At least we got away. We're going to need more than paper mache rockets next time. If we have real magical girls, then we have to plan the next job extremely carefully."<p>***<p>Ranma looked around and then leapt into an alley just behind the building. She had to find the person who had her transformation item, or something similar. At least something that could lend her power in order to take care of these creatures. What happened scared her unlike anything had before.<p>That creature was alive. It responded, it attacked, and it reacted, so it wasn't an illusion. Worse, she could feel where her chest was stinging, and she was sure that if it wasn't for her training, and everyone who attacked her all the time, then she would have been dead. The dragons flame weapon had hit her with some impact, and since it was fire coming her way, it wasn't an ordinary breath weapon.<p>But what type of creature didn't give off Ki or Chi?<p>She was worried, but more, she had to appear. Since no one was around, she detransformed slower than she had at home, and this time managed to come out with all of her clothing intact. A transformation item was definately at the top of her list. Yep, no way was she going to put up with this for long.<p>Then again, it meant the end of her date, without her getting into trouble, or having to pretend anymore. Hopefully, Ryouga would be lost and that would be the end of it, although she would have to put in at least a half hour of looking for him. She muttered to herself as she left the alley, "Baka, he almost always disappears when a good fight happens if someone doesn't keep an eye on him."<p>"Ranma-chan! I thought you were lost when the explosion happened." Said Ryouga as she exited the darkness. "Do you know who was fighting? It sounded like a good battle."<p>Ranma's eyes widened at the impossibility. The one person on the planet who couldn't cross the street without getting lost unless he had a GPS unit was here, next to her? As she looked at the boy in wonder, causing him to blush heavily, she thought to herself, 'Ryouga is able to find where he's going? He's next to me? He was able to find me in less than a week? If I find whatever God or Goddess did this to me, then I am going to get them. This is just too weird!'<p>Ryouga just looked at Ranma as her eyes were wide and shining. Gods, she was so beautiful like that. Her delightful face, those short breaths that did so much for her chest, those full, kissable lips...<p>Ryouga started to stab himself with the other end of the small weapons he and Ranma's mother had prepared earlier. Such evil thoughts were to be kept away. Besides, he had Akari, and she loved him. There was no room in his life for such a wonderful girlfriend as Ranma made.<p>Ranma just blinked as Ryouga turned to the wall as started to pound it with his head.<p>***<p>He blinked while reading the report.<p>Someone in the organization was playing a joke. The men were ok, and they hadn't suffered any real harm, so why this tale of a 'Magical' girl. Did they think he was stupid?<p>Well, he had expected some of them to fool around, and he knew the possibility of them just trying to show off, so nothing had happened that wasn't expected.<p>Now, to plan the next series of strikes while keeping these people quiet. Having them spread rumours within the organization was bad enough.<p>However...<p>Perhaps...<p>Maybe create a heroine so that his people could get away? That would keep to the mindset of the Japanese people, and he could have the two 'Antagonists' play off against each other while the real work took place. It would work, but planning it would set the organization back a few days.<p>Now, how to find the perfect patsy if they wanted someone incompetent, or to find the perfect female atlete who could fulfill this expectation.<p>Decisions, decisions...<p>***<p>Akane was angry. Watching carefully out her curtained windows, she was now convinced that Ryouga's ability to get lost was all an act. There was no other explanation for what she was seeing. The bastard had managed to fool them all, and he had the audacity to try and steal HER fiance. She was first. She had proposed. Ranma was HERS!<p>And Akane couldn't do a damn thing but watch, because if she interfered, it would make her look bad.<p>Ryouga was slowly walking Ranma to the house. Not much in itself, but when you took in the fact that Ranma was just staring at Ryouga, with an expression that showed she was a bit...dizzy, and she was obviously NOT leading, one had to wonder. Especially since Ryouga was going directly towards the front door. But the thing that REALLY made Akane angry was the way Ranma was walking. Gone was the confident stride, replaced with a slightly awkward walk, one that indicated that her hip area was somewhat...sore.<p>When the next day came, if Ryouga made one wrong move...<p>He would learn, the hard way, what he had forced her to do to Ranma.<p>***<p>The thoughts going on in Ranma's mind were somewhat different, and she had let Ryouga lead because the longer he did, the more likely he would get lost, and she would have time to sit down and really think about what happened. At the moment, things were too confusing to be real. She had dismissed it earlier, but was it possible she was still dreaming?<p>First the whole thing with AKANE, the one most likely to not want a marriage, proposing, and acting like the 'pervert' she always accused her of being. Then the date, which was undisturbed. An unprecidented event in her life as everytime she went on a date before, something or someone had disturbed it, well except for that time with Kuno, of all people. And the battle, which should have been something as simple as stoping those idiots stealing from a bank in Nerima. Only idiots would think they could do that and get away with it, but they did. And it was thanks to a guy with a pet dragon.<p>But Ryouga being in the right place at the right time? That was when everything became surreal.<p>How had he found her, and why was it after the fight?<p>Who was that mysterious masked man?<p>What was going on?<p>Why had they just walked into a house?<p>Ranma blinked. Walked into a house?<p>She looked around, and then gulped. Ryouga had manage to lead her straight home! Looking at her watch, she noticed that it had only taken fifteen minutes, and that was unthinkable.<p>Her exaustion, her still aching body, and her ability to think reasonably shut down at that point and she fainted.<p>***<p>Ryouga was worried.<p>Ranma had been silent all the way back to her house, although he did wonder how they arrived so soon. And the way she was staring at him was beginning to make him think thoughts best left buried.<p>It was when Ranma started to collapse that he quickly grabbed her around the back and looked into her face. Wondering if she had been injured by that blast earlier. She was weaker than his Ranma, so it was likely that the strain of bringing out her magical form had overwealmed her. Sighing, he let his head dip a bit. How could this happen to him?<p>That was when the light turned on.<p>***<p>Nodoka looked at Ryouga and her daughter.<p>If a simple kiss at the door was able to make her daughter faint, then it was time to make her decission.<p>It was too soon to do much, at least as of yet, but she would start the process.<p>Ryouga would make a good husband for her daughter when she finally graduated high school.<p>***<p>Mousse came back in the restaurant, and was still swigging the Sake that he had bought a little earlier. If he hadn't seen it himself, hadn't followed, he would never have believed it. No wonder Ranma was unbeatable.<p>It also showed him why all those girls could never get Ranma to do what they wanted.<p>"Where were you Mr. Part Time?" a voice stated more than asked.<p>Mousse laughed. "Watching the most amazing things tonight. You know, I think I can make a big profit now. And if the tribe wants in on it, they had better rethink who they are."<p>Cologne watched as the boy took a long swig of the bottle finishing it, and opened another. She would let this go, obviously the boy was extremely drunk, and no proper answers would be had. "Just don't mess up the tables, we will need the place neat for the lunch rush tommorow."<p>Mousse laughed, long and loud. "No worries there Elder. I think that I'm actually going to start having some fun in Japan instead of just being a love-sick nuisance."<p>Cologne shook her head and started heading upstairs to bed, "You're dreaming boy. You are still a nuisance."<p>Laughing Mousse said, "You, who have trained the best female warriors of our generation have done it again. Just let me know, when you're ready, how you knew Ranma was a Magical Girl."<p>He then chuged back the entire bottle, falling into a drunen sleep.<p>Cologne sighed. The boy finally lost it. "Well tommorow is a new day. I just hope that this idiot has gotten his fantasies out of his mind."<p>To be continued...
