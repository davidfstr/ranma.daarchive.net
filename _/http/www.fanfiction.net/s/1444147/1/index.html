</div>"Nabiki, I need some help. How much will it cost?"<p>Nabiki looked at the person who was asking for her help and raised<p>an eyebrow. It wasn't that she was averse to helping but for some reason<p>having this person ask for help, and then ask how much it would cost was a<p>little worrisome. This had to be a matter so serious, that money would be<p>out of the question, even for her. "Just whatever it will cost me."<p>The person nodded. "I need to know something about Ranma, and I<p>cannot ask him directly, or know that I am looking into this."<p>Both of Nabiki's eyebrows raised at that. That it had something to<p>do with Ranma was expected, that she wanted this kept quiet was NOT in her<p>character. "It's extremely serious, isn't it? Is Ranma going to die or<p>something if we don't do something for him, if whatever it is, is not<p>correct?"<p>The woman before her sighed, and then sat on Nabiki's bed. "I'm<p>not sure. It could be serious, but asking Genma is out of the question<p>since he would lie to me, and to Ranma. I doubt Ranma even knows what is<p>wrong, which is another reason I don't want to talk with him about it."<p>"What exactly is wrong?" Nabiki inquired, not comfortable with<p>talking around issues when it came to business. While it was tradition,<p>anything that took more time made it difficult to plan and gather<p>information. "Do you think that something Genma has done<p>has...damaged...Ranma in some manner?"<p>"I'm not sure, it could be something that happened on the training<p>trip, or it could be his curse, or it may be the situation. Given what<p>I've seen, I'm afraid for him, and it may affect his happiness. I need you<p>to find out for sure."<p>"I'm sure it's not that bad, Aunt Nodoka. After all, Ranma has<p>faced everything everyone has been able to throw at him, and has always<p>come out on top."<p>Nodoka nodded, and then said, "That's why. He's almost perfect in<p>the Martial Arts, he keeps all of the ties of honour as best he can, and<p>does it in a fashion that no one can question, even though people accuse<p>him of things that he has not done, and are definitely not true. He has<p>proven himself a man, a leader, and a person who everyone admires, and<p>tries to emulate in some manner. However, something with this picture is<p>wrong. Very wrong."<p>Nabiki frowned, and then indicated for Nodoka to continue.<p>"I'm afraid that Ranma may have some problems with..."<p>Sexual Endeavours<p>Part One:<p>Beating Around the Bush...<p>A fan fiction based on Takahashi Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2<p>Saotome Ranma, Saotome Genma, Saotome Nodoka, Tendo Akane, Tendo Soun,<p>Tendo Kasumi, Tendo Nabiki, Kuonji Ukyou, Hibiki Ryouga, P-chan, Shampoo,<p>Shan Pu, Mousse, Mu Si, Cologne, Ke Lun, Kuno Tatewaki, Kuno Kodachi,<p>Tofu-Sensei, and Hinako Sensei are copyright 1987, 2000 by Takahashi<p>Rumiko.<p>Publishing rights: Japan by Shogakukan Inc. Tokyo<p>Hong Kong by Jademan (Holdings) Ltd.<p>North America by Viz Inc.<p>Written by Ichinohei Hitomi<p>Ranma smiled to himself as he completed his latest technique.<p>After several weeks, he had finally perfected a move that everyone would<p>not expect from him. After all, he _never_ paid attention to Happousai<p>unless he did not have a choice. While Ranma would never use the more<p>perverted techniques, he didn't deny that the little...whatever...was a<p>master of the Art, and thus had something to teach, if you knew where to<p>look.<p>Besides, it allowed him to work out his frustrations.<p>During the past year, since he had been at the dojo, everyone he<p>had met seemed to think of him either as a prize to be won (or taken in<p>some cases), an heir to various schools he didn't want to be associated<p>with, or the person everyone and their semi-mystical pet needed to kill,<p>maim, or enslave in order to prove they were better.<p>If he hadn't been observing and learning from everything that<p>everyone had thrown at him, his stress level would be a lot higher than it<p>already was.<p>If only the various ties of honour weren't hanging over his head<p>like a blade. The promise of being a 'Man Among Men', being engaged to<p>both girls and boys thanks to his father and uncle, that he did not know<p>the laws of the Joketsuzoku and thus had Shampoo as a bridal candidate<p>with the assorted problems (namely Mousse and Cologne), a perverted<p>martial arts master who he was technically supposed to obey as the head of<p>the school, trying to keep up his grades in academics, and who knew what<p>else was still to come.<p>People either admired him or hated him because of it.<p>That's why he was glad that since his mother had arrived, he was<p>allowed to have a room of his own.<p>If _ANYONE_ learned his greatest secret then he would definitely<p>be dead. Well, perhaps not dead, but at least ridiculed, made fun of,<p>and, if Nabiki had her way, make his life a living hell.<p>Giving a sigh, he left the dojo and went to the bath. If he had<p>timed everything correctly, everyone he knew would be out.<p>And that meant that he could go and have some _real_ fun.<p>***<p>Nabiki walked around the shopping district, absently looking at<p>various stores. If what Aunt Nodoka suspected was correct, it would<p>explain a hell of a lot. To think that the person who personified the<p>absolute 'ultra-masculine' image could not even think of...<p>Well, it certainly boggled the mind.<p>Nabiki's problem was how to confirm this without it getting out<p>over the entire district. Hell, if just her father learned about this<p>possibility, he'd be crying so loud, everyone would hear him, and that<p>meant Shampoo, and Cologne, then Ukyou, not to mention the Kunos, or her<p>hot-headed little sister. *Actually, Akane-chan would be the worst one to<p>learn of it. She'd think it was some kind of plan to be perverted and<p>_wham_! Ranma will either be punched, kicked, or malleted.*<p>Well, perhaps a look at his medical records, and then comparing<p>those with some of the books in the medical library might work. Then<p>again, the doctors would probably have noticed something physically wrong<p>since he did have to go through two cat scans previously. "Damn it, Ranma,<p>why can't anything be simple around you!" Nabiki muttered below her<p>breath, "All this trouble with your 'fiances' and it could be because of<p>some condition that you may not even know about."<p>Turning around, she headed for Dr. Tofu's, not noticing the small,<p>white cat that just happened to be below a fruit display.<p>Waiting until Nabiki was well away, the cat thought about what she<p>just heard. Something was wrong, and it was the cause of Ranma not<p>choosing her. She _knew_ it had to be something else, after all, who<p>could resist her charms, and Shan Pu had a lot of 'charm'. It was hard to<p>imagine however, Ranma was _PERFECT_! There couldn't be something<p>physically wrong with him. Padding slowly away, Shan Pu thought of those<p>perfect pectorals, the firm abdomen, the way...<p>She shook her head, and then started to run as fast as she could<p>to the Nekohanten. If there was anything wrong Great-grandmother would<p>know what to do. She always knew what to do, and then, perhaps, she would<p>be willing to help her once again to bring her husband home, or at least<p>get him to acknowledged the marriage.<p>Shan Pu didn't care if she lived away from the village for the<p>rest of her life, as long as she had Ranma, children, and, of course, the<p>wedding night which she fantasized about constantly.<p>Besides, she was sure it was Panda-man's fault. The man just lived<p>to create trouble, especially for her husband. If anything was wrong, it<p>had to be a curse of some kind, just like the curse of Jusenkyu. As soon<p>as Ranma acknowledge who Shan was, she was going to make sure that<p>Panda-man was sent to a breeding farm.<p>***<p>Ryouga, of course, was trying to find Akari's farm. He was sure<p>that it was somewhere around here. He knew it had to be around somewhere<p>since he passed these apartment buildings the last time he went to see<p>her. Looking at his new piece of survival gear, a handheld GPS mechanism,<p>which had been a gift from Ranma after the failed wedding, he changed<p>directions to follow the pointing mechanism. No word had been said about<p>why Ranma had gotten it, and Ryouga, in a rare mood, being sorry that he<p>messed up his friend's marriage opportunity for no good reason, decided<p>not to say a word himself. They both passed it off as something that would<p>be handier to have than a compass, especially in wooded areas.<p>In all fairness to the poor lost boy, this time it really wasn't<p>his fault. He was paying attention to the device, and it was supposedly<p>showing the way to get to Akari's farm. There was, however, a slight<p>hairline crack in the surface that wouldn't be noticeable, even under<p>close inspection, and that had let water into the unit, shorting out a few<p>of the circuits. Ironically, it was showing the way to a home he had<p>always been trying to find over the past year, the Tendo Dojo when he<p>wanted to go somewhere else.<p>***<p>character one frowned at the girl in the alley across the street<p>from her. She still couldn't believe it, even though she had seen the<p>transformation herself. "That little tramp!" character one fumed, "She's<p>been pretending to be a boy all this time! When I get my hands on her..."<p>She growled as the girl in the strange costume literally leapt to<p>the top of a five-story apartment complex. To imagine that her supposed<p>boyfriend was in reality a 'magical girl' was more than irritating.<p>character one was going to have some revenge, but the question was how.<p>character two a who was now revealed as character two b, the<p>person who had saved Nerima many times over the last year from various<p>threats, ranging from criminals to mystical people, was unbearably<p>beautiful. For that reason alone, character two a should be shown why<p>you never play with a girl's heart. Unfortunately, no matter the revenge<p>she wanted, character one could not risk harming her 'boyfriend', not<p>unless she wanted to take out the only person who could face all of these<p>mysterious threats. If they were actually threats and not just a publicity<p>stunt.<p>She had to plan carefully, find her weakness, at least<p>emotionally, and then attack her in that manner. It would be a perfect<p>revenge, and make sure that...that...girl was at least physically fine.<p>character one snorted, in a way character two b had the perfect cover.<p>No one would believe that a handsome, and absolutely perfect specimen of a<p>man would also be such a cute, beautiful, and sexy girl.<p>"You know," character one mumbled to herself, her hand clenching<p>unconsciously, "If I was in a manga or anime, all I would have to do is<p>grab a hammer and pound the jerk over the head. Too bad that's all<p>fantasy, the idea has a lot of appeal."<p>***<p>"Hey, Ranma!" a person said as she came into the computer lab,<p>"Finish your assignment for creative writing yet?"<p>Ranma kept his hand on his chest where he had clutched it. It was<p>hard enough finding the time to do his extra work, and also fortunate that<p>the juku he was in knew of his unusual situation, but he was always afraid<p>that this would get back to everyone he knew. How would they react to the<p>fact that the 'super dumb jock' was in reality a closet computer fanatic?<p>He didn't even want to try and find out, knowing that the girls would<p>probably all rush to the class, and his rivals would destroy everything he<p>was trying to do. One reason that he had chosen a juku that was as far<p>away from home as possible.<p>"Fine so far. Don't scare me like that!" Ranma replied, his voice<p>showing his annoyance.<p>"Yeah, right. The great writer and programmer gets so scared.<p>Admit it, you just got caught up in your machine again."<p>Ranma snorted right back, "So? Computers are a great way of<p>finding information, and they pay a hell of a lot better than being a<p>writer or artist. Hell, those people working for Square get money hand<p>over fist!"<p>His companion, a girl in a school uniform, short hair, and glasses<p>looked at him in askance, "Is money all you can think about?"<p>Ranma smirked back at the old argument, "Nah...There's also food,<p>sleep, hardware, programming, and RPG's."<p>Sakura rolled her eyes, "You know, despite your build and the way<p>I've seen you act sometimes, you're a real geek."<p>"Thanks for the compliment."<p>Growling under her breath, she peeked over Ranma's shoulder.<p>"What's with this 'character one' bit? Can't you even think of some<p>names?<p>"Nah, it's so people can insert names of their own. I figure if<p>the story is good enough, I can make it into the base of our RPG project.<p>Think of it, an RPG that you don't only have a base story, but animation<p>that sets out entire scenes, like a movie! It's the easiest way to have<p>things work out. Not only that, but we can also build on it, and create<p>several different scenarios based upon what's already happened. That way<p>we can recycle a number of the animation scenes with only slight<p>variations."<p>"Computers don't have that sort of video capacity."<p>"Ah...who cares about that right now. I figure that if it's<p>encoded right, we can fit the whole thing into about 8 Megs of data, and<p>only 300 Kb of program." Ranma replied.<p>Sakura looked at him carefully, "Ranma, the only way you could do<p>that is to write directly to machine language."<p>"Of course! That's what makes this format so beautiful!"<p>Sakura groaned. What would it take to get this geek away from<p>that damn machine and get him to notice her! He wasn't a dumb jock, and<p>the fact that he was a very smart, and somewhat idealistic and naive guy<p>should have left him open to the slight suggestions she was making.<p>"Ranma...Oh never mind, just go back to what you were doing."<p>He shrugged slightly, and then got back to writing. Everyone here<p>would likely know the source from which he was creating his stories for<p>the project, but what the hell. Besides, it was fun, and he could make<p>situations happen in the stories that would never happen in real life. A<p>glint came into his eyes as he thought of something. Perhaps a few hidden<p>codes in the story. When he compiled it, only the most fanatical of<p>players would discover them, and then he could add a second hidden story<p>to the game. Maybe a sex story; they always seemed to make money, or at<p>least fans.<p>***<p>Tofu-sensei's eyebrow raised as he looked at Nabiki. "Why would<p>you need to have copies of all of Ranma and Akane's medical records?"<p>Nabiki sighed. "Ranma would have been married to Akane, if the<p>wedding wasn't ruined by the various guest who showed up. While it is a<p>matter of family honour, I've got to give the traditional proof of both<p>families to idiots like Kuno-chan before we can try again. Kuno-chan<p>would love to prove that Ranma was some type of undesirable, either from<p>family history, or some sort of medical problem which may be genetic."<p>"I heard rumours about his stability, but is he really that much<p>of a fanatic?" Tofu asked quietly, "If he is, perhaps I could help by<p>having a group 'talk' to him for the sake of the community."<p>Nabiki grimaced. "It's already been tried with Kuno's father, who<p>happens to be the headmaster of Furinkan. Unfortunately he is too well<p>connected to do anything. Why else would the various teachers have been<p>willing to be humiliated by him, or the fact that all of his programs are<p>overlooked by the education ministry? The man is an idiot, crazed, and a<p>threat to the students, but he is allowed to be free."<p>Tofu frowned. "How bad is he of a threat to the students? Is it<p>only physically, or are there more serious issues to be concerned about?"<p>"The school will be fortunate to have one person advance to a<p>proper level given what has happened."<p>Tofu sat up suddenly. If what Nabiki was implying was correct, it<p>was extremely serious. How powerful was the Kuno clan? "Nabiki, tell me<p>without wavering. Is there a threat to the students proceeding towards<p>dishonour?"<p>Nabiki nodded. "Jukus are practically forbidden by the headmaster<p>unless it has to do with studying about Hawaii. I doubt that many will<p>pass the Juken, and even then, it will have to be overseas training."<p>Tofu nodded, and started to gather Ranma and Akane's files,<p>medical records, and personal information. "It will take me a little<p>while to write up a letter for each of these files, and I now understand<p>the urgency. I would like you to describe your impressions of the<p>headmaster, for the records. I will, of course, keep your name out of<p>this, and have an observation group enter the school. There are several<p>Ministries which will be interested in this information, and that have<p>more...influence, than the Ministry of Education."<p>Nabiki nodded. Trading information was good, and perhaps<p>something could be done about the head nut. Perhaps a pool on how long<p>before Headmaster Kuno was removed, or the date when he was to be removed<p>would be appropriate. It wouldn't hurt to make _some_ money on this deal.<p>***<p>Laughing maniacally, Ranma prepared his move, knowing that he<p>would be successful, and that his foe would be defeated, if not dead, for<p>daring to try and go after him.<p>"Saotome, just roll the damn dice. Whenever you laugh like that<p>it sends chills down my spine."<p>"Ah, you're just jealous that I can pull it off. Besides, my<p>character is supposed to be half crazy because of that mind control<p>attempt a while back, and you're the one who designed the spell that did<p>it."<p>"Hey, how was I supposed to know it'd backfire like that?" Ryu<p>grumbled. "Just because you failed your saving throw is no reason to take<p>it out on us."<p>Ranma replied by dumping a glass of water on his head, "Well, I<p>_do_ happen to have some experience with real curses and magic you know."<p>Ryu grumbled while the others laughed.<p>Hikaru, the gamemaster, then pointed at Ryu, and then at Ranma,<p>and everyone broke out laughing even harder. It got even worse when Ranma<p>put her hands under her chin and fluttered her eyelashes coquettishly. He<p>then said, "You're the only one I know of Ranma, that can make<p>role-playing something else."<p>Ranma grinned, "Yeah, I know, and I'm great at it. Now about the<p>spell point system that we're using, it seems a bit limited since we are<p>basing it upon a person's knowledge, constitution, and stamina. I know it<p>doesn't work that way in real life, heck, martial arts doesn't work that<p>way in real life, at least not at the higher levels."<p>Ryu nodded, "Yeah, and if anyone should know, it's Saotome. His<p>life is filled with all sorts of strange things happening."<p>"Problem is, it would be hard to fit into the current game<p>system." Sakura mused from where she was sitting. "We'd have to tear it<p>apart and revise the damn thing, not to mention making new spells to take<p>everything into account."<p>"It's better that we do it now than later," commented Kenchiro as<p>he looked over the printouts he had. "The only way to confirm the system<p>that we are going to code is to test it out, and that means changing<p>things before we go any further and creating internal blind spots."<p>Everyone groaned, and Ranma sighed. Just when she was about to<p>take out the sorcerer who had created those pools of sorrow...<p>***<p>Cologne frowned as she went into her sanctum. It was hard to<p>imagine that anything would be wrong with Ranma, but the possibility could<p>not be denied. Physical problems were laughable, especially at the rate<p>Ranma learned techniques, or how he could hide the amount he was holding<p>back against all of his opponents. He even managed to hide his true power<p>from her!<p>To Cologne, the real question was what could be wrong in Ranma's<p>upbringing by his cowardly father.<p>Cologne had given up on getting Ranma for her tribe quite a while<p>ago. He was stubborn, egotistical, did not want to be held down, and had a<p>lot of problems with honour thanks to that no good father. As far as she<p>was concerned, Genma was thinking with only one thing, his stomach. Why<p>else would he make a deal with Ukyou's father for just a yatai, or teach<p>his son that eating and martial arts were the be all and end all of life?<p>That attitude was probably what was wrong with Ranma.<p>Then again, her granddaughter was not making things any easier.<p>The foolish girl was scheming, underhanded, and obviously not<p>thinking of the future as she kept thinking that her own culture was the<p>only one that mattered. The worst, absolute worst, deed she had done was<p>to try and break up the marriage between Ranma and Akane, not realizing<p>that in this country they could already be married, the couple just had<p>not completed the public ceremonies. After almost a year in this country,<p>Shampoo kept showing her ignorance and unwillingness to learn.<p>Admittedly, she had originally come to this country with Shampoo,<p>thinking that Ranma just needed a little bit of encouragement, and that he<p>would recognize the laws that he had inadvertently crossed. Cologne was<p>not against plotting, or doing something that could lead to more for<p>Shampoo, but she had at least made an effort to learn the laws and culture<p>that she was living in. She had also believed that the boy had been told<p>of the laws both times, when he had been confronted by Shampoo in the<p>village, and then later when he had 'defeated' Shampoo as a male.<p>It was Shampoo's failure to tell the girl of the law, or even<p>confirming the consequences when confronting Ranma the first time that led<p>to her being retrained at Jusenkyo. It was only when she came back to<p>China had it been learned that the girl only battled the winner of the<p>tournament thinking that it was a battle over food, which it should have<p>been. To have later learned that Shampoo had lied about how Ranma had won<p>the match in male form, and to have not explained the circumstances first,<p>which would have required Ranma to make a formal challenge, was worse.<p>If this was learned about back in the village, Shampoo would be locked in<p>her cursed form.<p>No, it would do no good to take Ranma back to China, which is why<p>she did not interfere with the boy coming back to Japan when she had ample<p>opportunity to keep him in the country, and in the village.<p>Besides, even if the law had been followed properly, Ranma would<p>be the worst possible person to have in the village, especially since<p>trouble followed him like a magnet. Pantyhose Taro who would constantly<p>challenge him in some deluded belief that this would get Happousai to<p>change his name, ghosts coming around to disturb the boy, and strange<p>challenges that no seemingly rational person would accept. To top it off,<p>the Japanese seemed to take all of this in stride as normal!<p>Why else would they not complain to the authorities about that<p>Kuno family, with the boy making ludicrous statements that no one actually<p>believed, the daughter using dangerous items that could cause innocents to<p>die, and the father who wanted to torment everyone with a very bad<p>haircut. Or worse yet, allow Happousai to live for the most part<p>peacefully even though everyone, even the government, knew where he lived.<p>No, despite what her daughter, granddaughters, and<p>great-granddaughters, as well as others in the village thought, the<p>Japanese were not backwards people with no respect for others. The<p>warriors in this small section of Japan, a small, virtually unnoticeable<p>and unremarkable district of Tokyo were extremely strong, with many being<p>able to defeat the entire village without having to resort to special<p>techniques that were within their own culture. Thankfully her<p>great-granddaughter had never run into that 'Nuku-Nuku' girl from Akie's<p>because Cologne had seen the girl take on an attack helicopter and win.<p>Cologne doubted her own chances at surviving at a distance.<p>The manga and anime that the Japanese created were mild in<p>comparison to what went on in the district every day.<p>If they brought Ranma to the village by force, or even made him<p>angry in any small way, the Joketsuzoku would cease to exist. He would<p>have to be kept either drugged and helpless, or given control of the<p>village, which would be unthinkable by the hidebound council. Anyone who<p>believed that Ranma, the person who killed Saffron, would be happy in a<p>small village with very few modern conveniences was crazy. To that end,<p>Cologne was more concerned with making friendly contacts, teaching Ranma<p>and any of his friends whenever they wanted to learn, and try to<p>understand the Japanese people and why they thought the unusual normal.<p>As for Ranma, the boy was annoying at times, but he was brilliant,<p>if anyone actually took the time to see what he was doing. No, if there<p>was a problem with Ranma, then it would have to be in his upbringing, and<p>the fact that his father treated women as objects and not people. Given<p>this, and how shy, and scared of contact with girls who were overly<p>affectionate, despite his curse, he would not accept being trapped in that<p>manner. Admittedly, he had reason to be that way, given how every girl he<p>met seemed to want to throw herself at him. She was quite sure that if<p>the current four girls were not martial artists, he would have more after<p>him.<p>No, for the sake of peace, she would have to take a hand in this,<p>although not in the way Shampoo would like. She would need to find some<p>way to create a public marriage ceremony for the boy, and from the looks<p>of it, it would have to be with Akane. There was no way she would come<p>between Ranma and that girl!<p>Besides, it would also allow her to remain in Japan, and she did<p>like all of the amenities, especially videogames.<p>With that thought, Cologne unlocked her private cabinet, turned on<p>the television, and selected her favourite game. An RPG featuring three<p>young girls who happened to be the saviours of another, magical, planet...<p>***<p>Sakura grinned suddenly. The perfect way to get Ranma to notice<p>her had just popped into her head! If she used a variation LHA compression<p>format series and applied that to the text of the RPG they were working<p>on, they could get the whole thing under 2 Megs, and it would only add<p>about 40 Kb to the size of the main program, 64 if she was designing it to<p>perform on the fly decoding with the help of a mini-database. This was a<p>way to show the most egotistical programmer of their juku that he wasn't<p>the best.<p>Misa rolled her eyes as she saw Sakura's expression. "Only one<p>thing could cause that. You've thought of a way to best Saotome."<p>Sakura nodded in excitement as she sipped her drink. "Yep! It's<p>the perfect way to show 'his arrogance' that he's not the only programmer<p>around!"<p>"You sure that it isn't just another way to get him to go out with<p>you?"<p>Sakura started to cough as a bit of her drink went down the wrong<p>way. "Me? After that arrogant bastard? You've got to be kidding."<p>Misa shook her head, "Ranma is a bit rough around the edges, but<p>he's always a perfect gentleman. And you know how many girls are already<p>after him, and they have no idea of what he can really do. How many more<p>girls do you think would be after him if they knew his real skills?"<p>"A lot..." Sakura sighed. Misa was correct about her reasons for<p>trying to better Ranma. "Look, he respects people who do their best, no<p>matter what. He wants someone who can think, or act, or do something that<p>is their best, and will always try to better themselves. It's the reason<p>he keeps with that Tendo Akane, despite how she treats him. All I'm doing<p>is giving him a reason to look elsewhere, not trying to force him to look<p>at me."<p>"That is not how you grab a man you know."<p>"So? It's the best way to work with him. There are already too<p>many 'enthusiastic' girls after him and trying to force him to lose his<p>virginity. How would you like it if boys were trying to force you to lose<p>your virginity?"<p>"Show me where those boys are so I can!"<p>"MISA!"<p>***<p>The Next Day...<p>Ranma sighed happily on the way to school. Everything seemed<p>right, and with the day being so peaceful, he could concentrate on a few<p>more things, although he still had to be careful of Shampoo. Then again,<p>his luck would never hold that long.<p>Of course, what Ranma considered peaceful would be what others<p>considered violent.<p>The day started off well, with his father, for once, asking to<p>spar instead of tossing him out the window. He managed not to get dunked<p>in the pond, but also refused to do the same to his father, and with his<p>mother's presence, especially her looking directly at his father several<p>times, Ranma did not have to protect his food. Ranma and Akane were<p>getting along, at least no words of war had been exchanged as of yet, and<p>even Nabiki was being nice. Of course, it could have something to do with<p>his mother wanting to go out somewhere with him this evening, but it<p>seemed Ranma spent very little time with his mother.<p>Amazingly enough, he made it to school without Shampoo being along<p>the way, no Ukyou, and even more amazingly, no Kuno at the gates. Ranma<p>blinked, grabbed his arm, pinched to make sure, and blinked again.<p>Despite that test, he felt as though he was dreaming. No way could the<p>day be going that well. In fact, there was no way that anyone could have<p>as good a day as he'd been having.<p>Ranma frowned suddenly. *It can't last. Nabiki being nice, the<p>day going well, and not a single argument with Akane. I better be extra<p>careful today, since it could be more dangerous than ever.*<p>His eyes boggled when Akane grabbed his hand and pulled him gently<p>towards class, and there wasn't an explosion. Ranma then noticed NABIKI<p>smiling and nodding in satisfaction. He looked around franticly, and saw<p>everyone with smiles on their faces, not paying attention to what was<p>happening, and not even noticing how close Akane was to him. It was<p>wrong! Unnatural! It couldn't be happening! He had to be asleep!<p>*Yes! Asleep! That had to be it! No way could any of this<p>happen without a lot of people staring, or looking on, or making a bet, or<p>anything. And I _know_ it has to be a dream since Nabiki is smiling at<p>Akane holding my hand without trying to make some sort of money off of it.<p>Well, since this is a dream, might as well enjoy it.* Ranma thought to<p>himself, not realizing the problems that his actions were about to<p>cause...<p>***<p>English Class:<p>"Ranma, would you please read article twenty-seven and give us<p>your interpretation of the described events, and what this means for the<p>general populace of Japan. Also, I want you to write the definition of<p>word twelve in paragraph three on the board for the class." Hinako-Sensei<p>said as she prepared herself for another bad reading. The boy was one of<p>the worst at English that she knew of, and could barely get the shapes of<p>Romanji correct a lot of the time, so she didn't expect much. Still,<p>foreign language studies were required, and she somehow had to drill it<p>into his head in the next two years.<p>Ranma looked at the word first, before he started to read, and<p>came up to the board. Fortunately, it was a word that he was familiar<p>with, especially since the definitions were a bit unusual; he'd had to<p>look it up before. That he had to get such an easy word to write the<p>definition to in his first class of the day was proof that it was a dream.<p>No matter what happened for the rest of the day, he'd take it in stride.<p>*Might as well have fun with this, especially since I would never be able<p>to get away with it in real life without a protest!*<p>Variable: Anything which may change and thus change the outcome of a<p>given circumstance. In context, a named container that can hold a value<p>consisting of a character string of any length. The variable can be<p>created by applying a name and placing the value within with a put, place,<p>or input command.<p>Hinako-Sensei boggled at the fact that Ranma had written, and<p>expanded upon, an English definition without looking at a dictionary,<p>book, or reference guide, and the fact that the Definition was written in<p>Romanji, and in ENGLISH! She almost fainted, but kept pinching herself<p>behind her back as Ranma then turned around, and started to read the<p>article, without problems, and like an American. This was a dream. It<p>had to be a dream. Nothing else made sense.<p>Math Class<p>The Sensei was amazed, confused, and absolutely happy!<p>Ranma, the worst student in the class, was answering every<p>question correctly! He had even gone through several quadratics without a<p>problem!<p>"Saotome-kun, I would like you to come up to the board and<p>demonstrate the solution to the equation that I have placed there."<p>As Ranma stepped up to the board, and went into the mathematical<p>proof that showed how one was equal with negative one, he smiled wider.<p>The proof required knowledge of calculus, topology, and dimensional<p>variance. Since Ranma could do this, then he was a genius, and since he<p>had not demonstrated such abilities before, it had to be thanks to His,<p>Aida-Sensei's, teachings.<p>He cried tears of joy as he stated, "Absolutely correct,<p>Saotome-san!"<p>Sociology Class:<p>"...given the upheaval caused by modern society, and how our<p>people have reacted at times, Japan seems to have a tendency to acquire<p>mannerisms slowly, as is evidenced by the strength of 'Rock and Roll' from<p>the American and British mid 50's to mid 60's era as opposed to the modern<p>'Punk Rock' currently the issue in North America. This is not to say that<p>the trend is not followed, however, as there must be some manner of<p>adaptation, as our society would easily stagnate.<p>"Examples of this adaptation are plentiful when we compare it to<p>American culture, especially since we have been brought up in a manner<p>conversant with conservation of resources. Our society recycles and<p>reprocesses every little bit that we can due to our limited resources as<p>compared to the small recycling effort of the Americans with their<p>plentiful resources. We adapted to an area of the globe with few<p>resources by learning how to recycle. Now, how does this apply to the<p>social context of society and business and the relationship of a<p>recognized 'Feudal' society as represented by Japan versus a 'Democratic<p>Republic' such as the United States?<p>"The answer is quite simple, as our culture has already adapted<p>the 'Feudal' model of society as a semi-rigid structure and cross-pasted<p>democratic processes, already in place in the lower levels of society, as<p>a means of satisfying the American military and cultural forces who wished<p>to cause an upheaval similar to, and with the same intent, that the<p>cultural upheaval by the European Christian elements caused in Native<p>North American Society. Further, by having the model applied to business,<p>especially with a military approach to the subject, as Sun Tzu is still<p>required reading to everyone involved in Japan's economic prosperity, this<p>has allowed us to prevent Americans from 'culling' our society as was<p>attempted by the French to the Vietnamese people prior to World War II..."<p>The class was amazed as Saotome went on, but no one wanted to<p>interrupt him. Ranma usually slept in class, never said a word, barely<p>passed his courses, and reacted to everything with a physical reaction<p>rather than an intelligent one. A few of the braver ones in back of Ranma<p>were staring at him, then Akane who had been surprisingly silent, and then<p>back at Ranma.<p>Ranma, being this knowledgeable and intelligent?<p>It was either a dream or the world was coming to an end.<p>Computer Class:<p>The teacher was amazed at the speed with which Ranma typed, and<p>the fact that he had finished his assignment in five minutes after the<p>class started, when he was sure that Ranma could hardly turn on the<p>machine without an accident was nothing short of amazing! Surreptiously,<p>he started to check the network to see if something happened. He would<p>not be surprised if something like that American movie happened to Ranma.<p>Given the strangeness, it would be just like the boy to be able to absorb<p>the entire knowledge and the database of a mainframe through an electrical<p>accident. If not here, then somewhere. It was the only possible<p>explanation for the boy being THIS good.<p>***<p>Ranma sighed happily. It was a good dream so far. Nice and<p>peaceful, no one bugging him with unwanted questions, and not being<p>splashed with cold water at the most unexpected times. Ukyou was friendly<p>without mentioning the engagement, Kuno was nowhere to be seen, Akane was<p>friendly and did not try to feed him, and now it was time to go home and<p>spend some time with his mom.
