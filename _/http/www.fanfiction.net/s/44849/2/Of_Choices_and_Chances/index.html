</div>Of Choices and Chances (2/?)<br/>By GT Ranma-Chan<p>Finding an apartment turned out to be easier than she thought. A<br/>few well-placed questions and one visit to an agency later, she<br/>found herself standing in a small, vacant room and uttering the<br/>words "I'll take it."<p>She had to fork over three months rent in advance, though, which<br/>did cut into her funds substantially. But she ended up with a<br/>room in a quiet neighborhood in Kobe, on the second floor<br/>overlooking a street. She had to share the bathroom with the two<br/>other young women that lived on the floor, which meant she would<br/>have to be careful when it came to shower time. But still, it<br/>was her first apartment, and somehow it felt wonderful as she<br/>stood there for a time trying take it all in, even though the<br/>room was smaller than her place at the Tendou residence and had a<br/>much tinier closet. It did have a small desk with a couple of<br/>empty drawers, though. She would have to buy a mat to sleep on,<br/>but then that had always been part of her plan.<p>Her name was now Ranko Yamamuri. She wasn't certain why she<br/>chose the surname, except perhaps that it sounded bland enough to<br/>hopefully not attract attention. Which was her objective, after<br/>all. She briefly considered changing the familiar name as well;<br/>Reiko and Ryoko flashed briefly in her mind as suggestions, and<br/>if she had to choose she decided she'd have gone ahead with the<br/>latter, in deference to one of her all-time favorite anime<br/>characters. But upon reflection she decided to keep with Ranko<br/>after all. The name wasn't terribly unheard of, just a little<br/>rare. On top of that, she was setting herself up with enough life<br/>changes as it was; to have to learn to answer to yet another name<br/>was perhaps too much in too short a time. Besides, "Beautiful<br/>Chaos" sort of suited her sense of humor.<p>She would probably have to work on getting some kind of<br/>identification under that name, she realized. But at present no<br/>one had asked her for any, so she figured as long as no one was<br/>asking she was prepared to put it off for as long as necessary.<br/>Who knows, perhaps she'll come to a conclusion long before she<br/>needed one.<p>The only drawback to all of this was that she realized she would<br/>probably have to do some of her workouts in the apartment. It<br/>was annoying, but necessary. She could probably do some of her<br/>her regular exercises in the park, but she also knew she was<br/>probably going to have to hold herself back when it came to her<br/>martial arts. Young women practicing the art were not uncommon,<br/>but a young woman exhibiting the kind of skill and precision she<br/>was capable of would almost certainly bring about attention.<br/>Which was exactly what she was trying not to attract. So, she<br/>was going to have to come up with some kind of regimen that she<br/>could do in the privacy of her own apartment. It would be<br/>difficult, but not impossible. Perhaps later, when she had a<br/>job, she might have enough money to join a club and have a dojo<br/>to work out in. But not at the moment<p>Finding a job. That was going to be her biggest problem. She<br/>certainly couldn't live forever on the money she had. She still<br/>needed some clothes; what she'd brought was enough to live on for<br/>awhile, but not indefinitely. Especially underwear; she knew she<br/>was going to have to get some of that soon, and that prospect<br/>filled her with an odd mixture of dread and something else she<br/>still wasn't sure she wanted to acknowledge. Then there was<br/>food: what was she going to live on, instant ramen noodles?<br/>Well, she supposed she wouldn't be the first poor kid on their<br/>own for the first time to do so.<p>She could just sit in her apartment and do nothing. Just on food<br/>and clothes alone, she figured her money might just stretch to<br/>the end of her three-month advance rent. A part of her wanted to<br/>do just that, or to chuck all of this and just go back to Nerima.<br/>But she killed that thought. The whole purpose of this was to<br/>live among people as a young woman, to interact with them as a<br/>young woman, to basically BE a young woman. To find out what it<br/>was like, and if the changes to her psyche she suspected were<br/>there in fact did exist. She owed it to Akane to find out, she<br/>told herself, while acknowledging at the same time she also owed<br/>it to herself.<p>She was in the middle of her ruminations, trying to decide what<br/>next to do, when there was a knock on her door.<p>"Who is it?" Ranko asked, as she unlocked the door and opened it.<p>Outside was a young woman, whom she had seen earlier when Mrs.<br/>Hayakawa, the land lady, had shown her around the maison. She<br/>was a small, young woman, about Ranko's height but of thinner<br/>build and probably a couple of years older than her, but not much<br/>more. She had long, straight black hair that reached just beyond<br/>her shoulders, and seemed to have a perpetual smile on her face.<br/>"Hi, it's just me, your next door neighbor. I saw you earlier,<br/>but didn't get a chance to say hello."<p>Ranko smiled. Somehow, she liked this person already. "Why,<br/>thank you, um...?"<p>"Sugasawa Fumiko." she said, with a slight bow. "And you are?"<p>"Yamamuri Ranko." Ranko returned her neighbor's smile. "Well,<br/>thank you, nice to meet you. I guess we'll be bumping into each<br/>other regularly."<p>"Probably." Fumiko said, with a laugh. Then she peered<br/>cautiously over Ranko's shoulder, as if trying to gauge<br/>something. "Err, um, I don't mean to barge in or anything, but I<br/>noticed that you came in with a small amount of luggage."<p>Ranko looked at her with a little bit of apprehension. "Um,<br/>yes?" she returned, cautiously.<p>"Well, do you have anything to sleep on?"<p>Ranko shook her head in the negative. "Uh, no. I was going to<br/>go out and buy something as soon as I settled in."<p>"Oh. Well, don't bother. I've got an extra bedroll you can<br/>have. Come on over to my apartment, and you can pick it up."<p>"Umm, how much?" Ranko asked, hesitantly.<p>Fumiko waived her hand dismissively. "Oh, don't worry about<br/>that. I've certainly got no use for it, and since you look like<br/>you're just starting out you're probably needing a little help.<br/>Am I right?"<p>Ranko shrugged, but nodded in the affirmative. "Well, thank you.<br/>That's very generous." And with that, Ranko followed her new-<br/>friend into the apartment next door.<p>Fumiko's apartment turned out to be larger than Ranko's, but only<br/>slightly. However, it was clearly more cluttered. A bedroll on<br/>the ground was unkempt, the covers thrown haphazardly to one<br/>side. On the room desk sat an older laptop currently with the<br/>screen down, and surrounded by a stack of books in a variety of<br/>languages. Judging by her brief look at the spines, Ranko judged<br/>the books to be mostly language-related. On the floor was a CD<br/>playing boom box, and a stack of CD's, mostly classical music by<br/>the look of the titles. There was also a small dresser, from<br/>which a number of drawers were open and various garments draped<br/>over the sides. The rest of her wardrobe looked to be scattered<br/>in various piles on the floor, although some of the piles looked<br/>as if efforts had been made to fold and be otherwise presentable.<p>Fumiko went immediately to her closet, standing on her knees.<br/>After pulling out some other clothes and pushing aside some of<br/>the dresses hanging from the bar, she gave a cry of triumph.<br/>"Here it is!" she exclaimed in satisfaction. She swiftly began<br/>to stack various items on the floor behind her. "Here's the<br/>bedroll. Here's also some sheets that go with it, a blanket, and<br/>an extra pillow."<p>Ranko stared at the pink-and-white patterned monstrosities before<br/>her, aghast. "Oh." she said, unconsciously mimicing Kasumi. "I<br/>didn't realize they were, um..."<p>Fumiko looked up at Ranko, faintly disappointed. "Oh, uh... I'm<br/>sorry, is that a problem? I didn't realize that maybe..."<p>Ranko considered for a split moment, but the fact that the other<br/>woman was willing to give her the bedroll for free finally won<br/>her around. After all, she now needed to watch her money. "Oh<br/>no, it's not that, it's just... I didn't expect it all to be<br/>'Hello Kitty'."<p>Fumiko gave her a slightly guilty smirk. "Yeah, I know. I used<br/>to be 'Hello Kitty' mad when I was a lot younger, and I took some<br/>of that stuff with me when I moved out. I got tired of it,<br/>though, and bought a new bedroll a few months ago." She sighed.<br/>"It just seemed a waste to throw the old one out, though."<p>Ranko bent down to pick up the items. "Oh well. I only need it<br/>to sleep on, I guess. It's not like I'm going to show people<br/>around my apartment." She gave Fumiko a reassuring smile. "Thank<br/>you. This is very generous of you."<p>Fumiko helped with setting up the bedroll. The sheets and<br/>blankets had all been washed and smartly folded prior to storage,<br/>so by the end of it the entire set was laid out in all of its<br/>ghastly, sickly-feminine glory. Ranko wanted desperately to<br/>cringe every time she looked at it. Still, she hid that very<br/>well from her new friend.<p>Fumiko helped her unpack her meagre belongings, mostly girl<br/>clothes she had accumulated over the years or squirreled away<br/>secretly over the past few weeks. Some had been things she had<br/>obtained for one hairbrained scheme or another. Most, like the<br/>underwear, had been lifted from one of Happosai's secret stashes<br/>or set aside from clothes the other girls had discarded. She had<br/>taken some time in assembling the wardrobe, concentrating on<br/>things that would not be missed or<br/>which she could purchase on the sly and not be noticed. Slacks<br/>figured prominently, although she did break down and purloin one<br/>of Nabiki's old black skirts, not that she ever had any intention<br/>of actually wearing it she told herself. A few blouses. The<br/>sundress she was currently wearing and one other made up all of<br/>the fancy clothes she carried. An assortment of t-shirts,<br/>sweats, and sweaters made up the balance. Her neighbor commented<br/>on the paltry collection, but Ranko shrugged it off by saying she<br/>had "planned to go shopping anyway." Fumiko volunteered to show<br/>her where the best local retail areas where, and before Ranko<br/>could think of a tactful way to decline the offer and instead go<br/>off on her own, she found herself walking down the street with<br/>the older woman at her side and heading for one of the main<br/>thoroughfares in the district.<p>After about a half hour, Ranko relaxed and decided to just enjoy<br/>the company. She wasn't certain why Fumiko was being so<br/>forthcoming toward her, but she soon began to feel the other<br/>woman's enthusiasm was infectious. It was pleasant, at least, to<br/>be able to talk with someone and not find that there was a<br/>purpose to their company, or to be always on the look-out for<br/>ulterior motives, or even to have to juggle conversations just to<br/>keep several different factions of fiancees from going to war<br/>with each other. Fumiko simply was a cheerful, optimistic person<br/>who truly liked to help people, and it soon became quickly<br/>obvious to Ranko that there were some things she was still in<br/>need of help with.<p>Fumiko nixed the slacks she was looking at. "Don't bother. You<br/>already have too many, and you said yourself your money needs to<br/>stretch as far as possible."<p>Ranko looked at the women's slacks on the hanger, and regretfully<br/>put them back. "Then what do you...?"<p>Fumiko pointed to a circular display behind the red-head.<br/>"There. You probably need a couple more skirts. A couple of<br/>knee lengths should do, and at least one full-length." Fumiko<br/>pulled a few, and handed them to Ranko. "Here, try these on."<p>Ranko looked at the cloth dismally. "But..."<p>Fumiko shook her head. "You said you wanted to go out job<br/>hunting soon, right? Well, look around you. How many working<br/>girls around here do you see wearing slacks?"<p>Ranko glanced around, and realized she had a point. A number of<br/>young women were around, many obviously on their lunch breaks<br/>from wherever. Very few were not wearing skirts or dresses.<br/>Inside of her, she could hear an entity called Ranma start to<br/>rail, but the only words she could speak were "Ok, I guess so..."<br/>Ten minutes and one size adjustment later, Ranko had three<br/>assorted-length skirts picked out along with a dark-gray sheaf<br/>dress Fumiko recommended. The price was more than she wanted to<br/>pay, but she decided to defer to the other woman's judgement.<p>Ranko entered the lingerie department with a queasy feeling of<br/>forebodence, but suppressed the urge to show it. She didn't want<br/>to come off as completely ignorant to her new friend. After all,<br/>she was suppose to be an average young woman buying clothes for<br/>herself, right? Wasn't that the role she was trying to fit in?<br/>So, all of this should have come natural to her. Besides, she'd<br/>actually been dragged off shopping for lingerie once or twice<br/>before. Admittedly, those instances had mostly been with her<br/>mother, who at the time didn't know this buxom young red-head was<br/>in fact her son. Still, she did come away with some knowledge.<br/>Like her bra size. And the awareness that if she was going to be<br/>condemned to wearing skirts and dresses for the foreseeable<br/>future, she also needed slips to go underneath them. So she<br/>picked out a few items, as bland and unfettered with lace and<br/>frills as she could find, and swiftly paid for and added them to<br/>her shopping bag.<p>Fumiko, ever the one to look out for her new charge, pointed out<br/>a set for her. Black, heavily set with lace, with bra, panty,<br/>garters, and a pair of stockings. Ranko merely glared at her.<p>A pair of shoes, some hose, a few more cosmetics, and a stop at<br/>the jewelry counter completed their trip. Afterwards, they<br/>stopped off for a quick drink at an outdoor caf‚.<p>"So, where are you from?" Fumiko finally asked.<p>The answer came out before Ranko could edit it. "Nerima." she<br/>said, then instantly wished she hadn't. At least say another<br/>district in Tokyo, she scolded herself.<p>"Ooo, I've never been there." Fumiko said pleasantly, which made<br/>Ranko feel a little more at ease. With her luck, she decided,<br/>Fumiko was just as likely to come from someplace nearby her<br/>former haunts. "I've only been to the Tokyo area once, and that<br/>was just on a weekend when I was twelve. Is it nice there?"<p>"Nice enough." Ranko responded, equally pleasant. She gave the<br/>older woman an ironic smile. "A bit boring sometimes..."<p>"Why did you leave?"<p>*To find myself.* she thought. "Well, I'm finished with high<br/>school, and most of my friends were moving on, so I just decided<br/>I wanted to get away from everything and move out on my own."<br/>Which was all true enough, she reflected, although the minor fact<br/>that half of her friends were also, at any given time, among her<br/>fiercest opponents also contributed greatly. "Tired of school,"<br/>she added, "which was why I decided to delay University for a<br/>year."<p>"What do your parents think of this?"<p>*Oh, nothing. They've probably only just found out.* "My<br/>parents... make their plans regardless of what I think." Ranko<br/>put just enough of an edge on these words for Fumiko to hopefully<br/>pick up that this particular avenue of conversation was closed.<br/>For a second the woman looked surprised, but then her face<br/>changed curiously. Fumiko politely allowed the subject to change<br/>when Ranko spoke next. "What about you? What are you doing<br/>here?"<p>"Oh, not much really. Like you, I guess I just decided I wanted<br/>to get away from everything and try seeing the world for a<br/>change. My family lives just outside of Kyoto, in company<br/>housing." She smirked. "I've got two other sisters, and all<br/>three of us were crammed into the same room. As soon as I was<br/>old enough I decided I wanted out."<p>Ranko nodded in sympathy; back in the Tendou residence she too<br/>had often felt like that, especially when at night her dad was<br/>snoring in the room they shared.<p>"Are you going to go to back to school?"<p>Fumiko's face faltered slightly, betraying a degree of glumness.<br/>"Tried. Lost by one point on the entrance exam." She raised her<br/>index finger in emphasis. "One point, one measly point! Can you<br/>believe that? Now I have to wait another year to retake the<br/>tests."<p>"That must be frustrating."<p>"Frustrating isn't the word for it."<p>They left the caf‚ and continued back toward the apartment<br/>building, stopping along the way to quickly pick up some non-<br/>perishable groceries and couple of cheap pots to cook food in;<br/>there already was a small kitchen in the apartment building with<br/>a communal stove and refrigerator, so there was a place to<br/>prepare some meals. Along the way, the two talked about<br/>inconsequential things, Ranko asking questions about the<br/>neighborhood and where things were, Fumiko supplying answers and<br/>periodically asking a few questions of the young red-head<br/>herself. All in all, it turned out to be a fairly enjoyable,<br/>relaxing afternoon, even if Ranko became faintly alarmed at the<br/>amount of money she had found herself to be suddenly devoid of.<br/>A year's worth of savings could simply NOT have gone away that<br/>fast.<p>Ranko had just finished picking out her one splurge (a cheap<br/>clock radio, mostly because she told her companion that she'd go<br/>crazy if she didn't have anything to listen to) when Fumiko asked<br/>a question that made her stop. "So, do you have anyone back home<br/>in Nerima?" she asked, with curiosity.<p>Ranko stopped for a moment, stumped. *How do I answer that<br/>question?* she asked herself. "Well, I guess sort of." she began<br/>carefully, hesitantly. "We've certainly talked about getting<br/>together, but, well..."<p>"But you haven't yet made the commitment."<p>"No, not as such. There are, um, still some issues that need to<br/>be resolved and, well..." Ranko let the sentence trail off<br/>uncompleted.<p>Fumiko nodded, as if she understood. "Well, then I won't pry any<br/>farther." she told Ranko.<p>"Thank you."<p>After a pause, Fumiko continued. Her voice, however, had<br/>suddenly become rather serious. "Ranko... Mrs. Hayakawa is a<br/>very nice lady. She's been around a long time, too, and has had<br/>her share of tragedies. If you treat her right, she can be a<br/>good friend and confidant. She'll let rules slide, she'll even<br/>let the rent slide, as long as she knows you're honest and not<br/>trying to take advantage of her." There was another pause. "If<br/>you have a problem or are in trouble, she's the person to go see.<br/>Trust me on this, I know."<p>Ranko blinked. "What makes you think I have any problems?" she<br/>blurted, perhaps more quickly than was prudent.<p>Fumiko merely smiled, knowingly. "I'm not saying anything.<br/>Just... giving you the heads-up, should something ever come up."<br/>The smile became a lopsided grin. "Us girls have got to stick<br/>together, you know."<p>At the apartment building they met a couple of the other tenants,<br/>a middle-aged dock worker who lived on the first floor, and<br/>another young woman named Noriko Taneda, who was the other young<br/>female occupant of the second floor. Taneda was on her hurried<br/>way down the stairs when they arrived, dressed in a black one-<br/>piece dress and late evidently for a night on the town with a<br/>boyfriend. She gave Fumiko a quick hello, gave Ranko a quick<br/>welcome-greeting, then departed into the evening.<p>"One last thing." Fumiko whispered into Ranko's ears, after the<br/>other young woman departed. "If you ever decide to bring your<br/>boyfriend up to your room, Mrs. Hayakawa usually turns a blind<br/>eye, so long as you don't draw attention to yourself when you do.<br/>Just remember: be discrete."<p>Fumiko giggled when she saw how red Ranko's face turned at THAT<br/>piece of advice.<p>And so, Ranko returned to her room, and unpacked her new<br/>purchases. She shook her head at the skirts and dress she had<br/>purchased, and at the other items that had found their way into<br/>her bags. She looked down at the Hello Kitty bedroll that<br/>awaited her, and then at the newly-purchased mirror on her desk<br/>surrounded by cosmetics and jewelry. She suddenly grew conscious<br/>of the straps to her bra, now digging into the skin on her back<br/>and shoulders. It had not even been 24 hours, and already she<br/>was becoming acclimated.<p>A part of her was scared at what she had so casually spent her<br/>day doing, but even so she thought that (if she was really honest<br/>with herself, but then again self-honesty had never been one of<br/>her strong points) another part of her was finding it oddly<br/>exhilarating, almost liberating. One segment of her was warring<br/>with another over the simple question of how she should feel, and<br/>as a result everything seemed tentative, unresolved. A distant<br/>feeling of vague, unformed something that she could only hope the<br/>coming days and weeks would bring into focus.<p>She grunted, smirked, and began to set up her room more to her<br/>liking.<p>One rep of kata, a bowl of ramen noodles, and a long cold shower<br/>later, she cuddled up underneath her pink cartoon-cat blanket,<br/>placed her had on the equally pink pillow, and calmly went to<br/>sleep, ending Ranko's first day.<p>And predictably, the dreams began to come once more.<p>END OF PART TWO<p>GT Ranma-Chan<br/>gt_ranma_<p>
