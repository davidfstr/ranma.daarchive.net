</div>Of Choices and Chances<br/>By GT Ranma-Chan<p>PART THREE<p>He was in a church, a western-style church. He knew it rather<br/>than saw it; the organ music, after all, was a dead giveaway, and<br/>there was the further clue that pews of some sort seemed to be<br/>stretching off on either side of him, going off far into the<br/>distance. He couldn't tell much beyond that; there was a thin<br/>white fabric hanging in front of his face, one which successfully<br/>hid whatever it was that lay beyond.<p>Somehow a bouquet of flowers had appeared in his hands. Strange<br/>that they should do so, he thought, but he kept them<br/>nevertheless. He was vaguely aware that he was suppose to be<br/>holding them at this particular moment, that it was expected of<br/>him to do so. They were pretty flowers, too; he could smell<br/>their fragrance.<p>They were moving forward. *They?* he thought, and suddenly he<br/>realized his father was standing next to him. He looked faintly<br/>ridiculous, dressed as he was in a tuxedo while still in panda<br/>form, but he displayed no outward appearance of finding the<br/>absurdity of the situation even remotely humorous. Somber,<br/>perhaps, but hardly humorous.<p>He grew aware that others were standing in the pews around him.<br/>Those on his right side he didn't know, except perhaps as<br/>indistinct faces he had met once or twice before. The ones on<br/>his left side, though, he all knew. Friends, family, extended<br/>family, acquaintances. Mom was there. So were Nabiki, Kasumi,<br/>and Mr. Tendou (*Where was Akane?* he wondered, but then reminded<br/>himself that he'd find her up front). Ryouga, the Kuno siblings,<br/>and several of his old classmates from Furinkan were also<br/>present. Happosai and the old crone too, being unusually civil.<br/>So was the middle-aged man with the slices of cheese on the<br/>platter (*Who the hell is that guy?* he wondered). Several more<br/>faces that he could make out, despite the white gauziness, all of<br/>whom were familiar.<p>They were all starring at him, as if accusing him of some crime.<p>As he passed them he felt a hard queasiness in his stomach, but<br/>decided it was just due to the clothes he was wearing. It was a<br/>rather tight outfit, after all; he could feel the material<br/>cinching him tightly.<p>He proceeded toward the front of the church. Akane was there,<br/>standing facing him. So were Ukyou and Shampoo. They were<br/>dressed alike, in lavender dresses. Or were they green? It<br/>didn't matter, he thought. All that mattered was that they were<br/>glaring at him.<p>Akane was mouthing the word "pervert" over and over.<p>*Why would she do that?* he wondered.<p>Then he noticed the person meeting them at the front of the<br/>church. Tall, handsome, dressed smartly in an expensive tuxedo.<br/>The person looked at him with a smile on their face.<p>For a moment, he couldn't make out whose face it was. Tatewaki?<br/>Ryouga? The features seemed to change so fast. Mikado?<br/>Picolet?<p>The face solidified on Picolet, and suddenly everything made an<br/>uneasy sense.<p>He'd lost, he decided. He'd lost the contest, and by the terms<br/>of their agreement, he had to marry Picolet. He had to; he'd<br/>given his word. That's why he was standing there in a wedding<br/>dress (which, suddenly, in all clarity, he knew he was wearing.<br/>*Why hadn't I objected to that before?*), why his father was<br/>reaching forth and shaking the young man's hand (*Idiot! This is<br/>your fault!*), and why suddenly he found Picolet's arm hooked<br/>around his, and together the two of them were advancing to the<br/>altar (*NO!*).<p>The priest smiled at them. "Does anyone know any reason why<br/>these two should not be wed?" the sage asked the congregation.<p>"Yes!" he shouted. "I'm a guy!"<p>Everyone acted as if they had not heard him.<p>The priest turned to Picolet. "Do you take this woman to be your<br/>lawfully wedded wife?"<p>Picolet nodded. "I do."<p>The priest turned towards him. "Do you take this man to be your<br/>lawfully wedded husband?"<p>*I can't marry him! I'm a guy!* he thought fiercely. But<br/>somehow, the words that came out were: "I do."<p>A ring suddenly appeared on his finger. Both of their fingers.<p>"You may kiss the bride." he heard the priest say. And with<br/>that, he watched in mounting horror as the white veil was drawn<br/>back, and Picolet's smiling face was before him.<p>"NO! I can't kiss you! I'm a guy!"<p>"Not any longer." Picolet said. "Now you're my wife."<p>"But I'm a guy!" he insisted, and to prove the point he lifted a<br/>kettle above his head and poured hot water upon him.<p>Nothing happened.<p>"The decision has been made for you." Picolet said, still<br/>smiling. "It was taken out of your hands by your father. So now<br/>you have to stay as you are."<p>"NO! I won't do it! I won't..."<p>Picolet leaned forward toward his lips. "Rejoice!" the young man<br/>said, "Now you don't have to fight it anymore!"<p>And with that, Picolet reached forward and kissed... her.<p>She opened her eyes. The church was gone. The altar was gone.<br/>Everyone else was gone. Except her and Picolet.<p>They were in a room. The walls were white, mountains of flowers<br/>were piled high, and ionian columns stretched above far into the<br/>sky. Behind her she could feel the presence of a bed.<p>The wedding dress was on the ground around her. She was standing<br/>in her underwear.<p>Picolet stood before her, still smiling. He was naked.<p>"You've wanted this for a long time, haven't you?" he asked her.<br/>It sounded more like a statement than a question. "To be able to<br/>give in, to not have to resist?"<p>She did not answer him. She could not. She dared not.<p>He reached forward and placed his hand on her waist. The cast<br/>iron corset peeled away, as if nothing. "To no longer have to<br/>suppress yourself, to just let yourself go?"<p>She still did not answer, but her face looked up directly at him,<br/>afraid. She felt him draw her closer.<p>"To finally let yourself be?" he finished.<p>She stared up into his face, his eyes. She felt his arms<br/>encircle her to caress, and his lips falling once more on hers.<br/>And she felt herself backing up, falling gently onto the bed.<br/>And felt him above her, still holding, still kissing, moving,<br/>holding, caressing, kissing, holding, moving...<p>A voice echoed. Low at first, but gaining momentum as he<br/>continued and she continued and they continued.<p>Madness, it said. Complete and utter madness.<p>Madness.<p>Madness.<p>Madness.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranko's eyes popped wide open, and she jolted with a start to a<br/>sitting upright position. "Mad...!" she yelped.<p>Her breathing was heavy, fast. She panted for several moments in<br/>the darkness, still stunned. Then slowly, uncertainly, she wiped<br/>her forehead with her arm, getting rid of the prodigious amount<br/>of sweat that had beaded on her brow.<p>She stared glass-eyed into the nearly-empty room, not so much<br/>seeing anything as to let the darkness take her mind off what she<br/>had just dreamt. She continued her heavy breathing, but slowly<br/>it began to subside.<p>*Dear god.* she thought. *That has to be the worst one.*<p>*No,* she corrected herself, after a moment's consideration, *the<br/>worst in months, but not the worst ever.*<p>As her ragged breath began to recover, she became aware of the<br/>sounds around her. From outside she heard a dog bark in the<br/>distance, and the sound of nearby solitary footsteps. A car<br/>passed slowly in the street, the ghostly glow of its headlights<br/>moving across the ceiling of her apartment. The low boom of an<br/>airplane rumbled from above, and the extremely faint whisper of<br/>pop music from a radio rose from below.<p>She continued to stare into space.<p>"What am I doing here?" she said to herself. "This is stupid. I<br/>could be on my way to China by now, going to the springs."<p>She glanced down at the bedroll she was sleeping on, and grimaced<br/>at the hideously cute incarnation of feline cartoon evil.<br/>*Funny,* she thought clinically, *how a real cat could make me go<br/>berserk, but a cartoon cat can only make me cringe for entirely<br/>different reasons."<p>She laid back down, and stared at the ceiling.<p>"I shouldn't be doing this." she continued. "It's crazy that I'm<br/>doing this. What possible good reason is there to put me through<br/>all of this?"<p>*The dreams.* she told herself. *Look at what the dreams are<br/>saying.*<p>She stared at the ceiling, and felt the first tendrils of fatigue<br/>reach out for her.<p>*That's it.* she concluded, finally. *I'm outta here. Doing this<br/>is only going to encourage everything, make it worse.* She<br/>closed her eyes, and laid her head to her side. "Tomorrow I'm<br/>going to Mrs. Hayakawa, tell her it was all a mistake, get my<br/>money back, leave, go on to China, and find a real cure. Not<br/>this stupid half-assed plan of mine.*<p>*Yeah, that's what I'll do.*<p>*Yeah.*<p>And as she drifted off to sleep, she tried to picture the look<br/>that would be on Akane's face when she finally returned. After<br/>the trip to China. When she was finally cured.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>It was early morning when Ranko stumbled into the commons room,<br/>wearing a set of light blue warm-ups she had taken with her from<br/>Nerima.<p>"You look awful." Fumiko told her as she entered, with a slight<br/>grimace. The young woman was at the counter, putting the<br/>finishing touches on her lunch package.<p>Ranko nodded, tried to stifle a yawn, and failed. "Rotten night<br/>of sleep." she said, stretching her arms and twisting one<br/>shoulder, mostly because it felt good to flex the muscles.<p>Fumiko nodded in understanding. "Let me guess: first night in<br/>your first apartment."<p>Ranko nodded vaguely. "Yeah, something like that."<p>"Took me a week to get used to mine. Don't worry, it passes."<p>Ranko went to one cabinet and began to pull at the small pile of<br/>pre-processed foods, looking for something quick to fix. Her<br/>second day out, and already she missed Kasumi's cooking. Oh<br/>well, it wasn't the first time she'd had to live on quickly-<br/>prepared meals. She pulled a packet of ramen noodles, and picked<br/>up a small pot from another cupboard.<p>"Have you given any thought about where you'll apply?" Fumiko<br/>asked, conversationally.<p>Ranko looked up from the stove, slightly confused. "Apply?"<p>"For a job. You know, where you want to work, what you want to<br/>do. Have you given it any thought?"<p>Ranko shrugged. "Not really. I guess I just planned to pick up<br/>a newspaper or go down to the employment office and see what's<br/>available." (*Not the employment office,* she corrected herself;<br/>*No identification.*).<p>Fumiko thought for a moment. "Do you have any skills? Typing?<br/>Computer? Anything like that?"<p>*Well, lets see. I can probably cream just about anybody you<br/>care to mention.* "No, not really."<p>"Well, that takes care of most office work then. There's always<br/>retail, I suppose."<p>"Not if I can avoid it."<p>"Smart girl." Fumiko considered for a beat. "Then there's<br/>always the clubs, you know."<p>Ranko shot Fumiko a glare. "The clubs?" she said carefully.<p>The other young woman returned the glare with a completely<br/>straight face. "Uh huh. You know, the night clubs. They're<br/>always looking for barmaids or dancers or girls willing to,<br/>umm..."<p>"Fumiko..." Ranko's voice took on an edge of ice.<p>"Oh, come on. It's short hours, good pay, and you get to meet<br/>all kinds of interesting..."<p>"FUMIKO!"<p>Fumiko burst into laughter. "Ok, I apologize. I thought that's<br/>what you'd say, but I just wanted to make sure. I'm sorry if I<br/>offended you." Despite the apology, a large degree of humor<br/>remained on her face and in her voice.<p>"Grrrrrr." *Ok, that's it. I'm leaving as soon as I can get my<br/>rent back. And even if I can't.* A thought struck Ranko. "What<br/>about you? What do you do?"<p>Fumiko told her. Ranko just shook her head.<p>"Hey, it's not bad. It's not strenuous, people usually don't<br/>bother you, and you spend most of the time standing around<br/>pushing buttons. That's it."<p>"It must get boring."<p>"It can be. But then that gives me an opportunity to think about<br/>my studies, so it's not a complete waste of time. Besides," she<br/>added, "it pays the bills. It's not like I'm going to make a<br/>career out of it, just until I can get into school." Fumiko<br/>considered again. "Say, if you're interested, one of the girls<br/>is leaving, so maybe..."<p>Ranko shook her head in the negative. "No, don't. I don't think<br/>I'd be interested. At least, not until I've checked on what else<br/>is available." *I'm leaving, so why bother?*<p>It was Fumiko's turn to shrug. "Well, suit yourself." She<br/>glanced up at the wall clock. "Which reminds me, it's time I<br/>went up and got ready to go. See you later?"<p>"See you later." Ranko agreed. *Or maybe, not at all.* Which<br/>reminded her of something. "Oh, by the way." she asked, at the<br/>departing Fumiko. "Have you seen Mrs. Hayakawa? I wanted to ask<br/>her something."<p>Fumiko shrugged again. "She left this morning, early. I, um, I<br/>don't think she'll be back until later, perhaps not even until<br/>tomorrow."<p>A confused, apprehensive look came to Ranko's face. "Tomorrow?<br/>Why?"<p>"Family business. Look, um, I can't explain it right now, but<br/>suffice to say she probably won't be back today." A deep sigh.<br/>"When I get off work I'll try to explain some more, but right now<br/>I've got to get moving if I'm going to make it on time." And<br/>with that, Fumiko turned and headed up the stairs for her<br/>apartment, leaving a slightly perplexed Ranko in her wake.<p>Ranko watched her depart. *What the?* was all she could think.<p>She gave a long sigh of resignation, and turned back to the<br/>stove. Whatever it was about her landlady, she supposed she'd<br/>find out in due course. In the meantime, there was this whole<br/>getting back on the road thing she had to consider, and how to<br/>ease out of this ill-advised side trip she'd concocted.<p>"Another day in my girl form." she mumbled to herself, as she<br/>returned to her boiling pot and makeshift breakfast. "You'd<br/>think the whole world was conspiring against me."<p>*Or agreeing with you.* one traitorous thought flashed.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranko had contemplated spending the day in her apartment, but<br/>after doing a short, modified rep of her kata she found she had<br/>too much pent up energy to long survive restricting herself to<br/>the small room's four walls. Still in the light blue warm-ups,<br/>she decided to expend some of that energy by just going outside<br/>and literally taking a jog around the neighborhood.<p>And as she did so in the morning air, she found herself going<br/>once more over the thought process' that had led her to this<br/>moment.<p>*I'm / a / guy, / not / a / girl.* became the mental mantra<br/>echoing in her mind for several blocks, with each word<br/>corresponding to the impact of one foot on the pavement. In a<br/>way she found herself hoping that constant repetition would<br/>silence the uneasiness that was taking up residence inside of<br/>her. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to be working. Contradicting<br/>thoughts and ideas fought one another as she pushed forward.<p>In some ways, she thought, she envied those of her friends whose<br/>curses made them into something other than human. From comparing<br/>notes with the others (mostly dad or Ryouga, but sometimes<br/>Shampoo or even Mousse), she had come to the conclusion that<br/>changes between species were much easier to handle mentally than<br/>changes within species. In part, she suspected that this was<br/>because the stark differences between the average pig or cat were<br/>much more pronounced than the corresponding human, and so it was<br/>much easier to note the mental discrepancies and shunt them aside<br/>or control them. As far as she could tell, for instance, neither<br/>Shampoo nor Mousse had any real desire to stay for long periods<br/>of time as a cat or a duck, and the only time Ryouga had had the<br/>urge to be a piglet was when he had the very human male desire to<br/>be close to Akane. That last had evaporated immediately upon<br/>Akane's discovery of the truth, and even with that new girlfriend<br/>of his Ryouga only descended to his pig form as rarely as random<br/>bursts of flying cold water would allow.<p>Of course, this didn't quite explain her father's predilection<br/>toward his panda form, but then Ranko just put that one down to<br/>the fact that her father was just a lazy SOB.<p>Yes, she thought. From what she'd been able to figure out after<br/>years of observation, having a curse that gave you a gender<br/>change was much more difficult to deal with than one that merely<br/>changed you into an animal. Despite the claims she loudly<br/>maintained to herself and to all who would listen, she was<br/>finding that there really was a difference between the two halves<br/>of her fractured existence, one that extended to more than just<br/>the physical. And it was there that the danger lied, because the<br/>differences were small, subtle, almost imperceptible. Very hard<br/>to detect, much harder to guard against, but ones which were<br/>fully capable of eroding away the masculine facade she had so<br/>determinably built and struggled to maintain since Jusenkyo.<p>When Ranma and Akane started to get close, really close, after<br/>the whole Phoenix affair and the subsequent failed wedding, that<br/>was when (s)he started to notice them. Yes, (s)he loved Akane;<br/>of that there was no doubt. But yet, between the two halves<br/>there was a perceptible difference. To Ranma, the attraction had<br/>a physical, sensual edge to it. In Ranko, however, those aspects<br/>where much more muted, replaced by a sensitive, emotional<br/>awareness that transcended everything. In both halves, Akane was<br/>the person that was adored; but only in one was she the one with<br/>whom intimacy was desired.<p>S(he) was struggling against ordinary biology, and s(he) was<br/>beginning to think that ordinary biology was starting to get the<br/>upper hand.<p>Considering the turmoil her mental state had undergone in the<br/>most recent months, it was the only explanation she could think<br/>of that fit. Girls were hardwired to do certain things, to think<br/>certain ways, just like boys were hardwired to do similar but<br/>different things and similar but different modes of thought.<br/>There were exceptions to these rules, of course, but for the most<br/>part the evidence was overwhelming that the template held true.<br/>So no matter how dominant her male half was, no matter how much<br/>in control her masculine self sought to be in at all times, it<br/>could not control the simple fact that in girl form female<br/>hormones were raging through her system, his mind was functioning<br/>in a brain that was naturally inclined toward female patterns of<br/>thought, and that his very male mental image was at odds with her<br/>overwhelmingly physical female body. No matter what the male<br/>Ranma said or did in their female form, he could not change the<br/>fact that said form had a natural predilection toward asserting<br/>what millions of years of evolution had dictated for it.<p>He'd been able to compensate for some time, vigorously, even<br/>ruthlessly, suppressing his feminine side wherever possible, both<br/>because he thought of himself as overwhelmingly male and because<br/>he had found the idea of a feminine self revolting. But years of<br/>exposure were taking their toll, his masculine guard was clearly<br/>not as adamant as it once was, and the female self was taking the<br/>opportunity to make its presence known, as if to say it would not<br/>be waved away by mere bluster.<p>She was finding herself becoming acclimated to her female half.<br/>This was becoming apparent in hundreds of ways, large and small.<br/>Apparel, for instance. When the curse was yet new, the idea of<br/>wearing girl's or women's clothing was anathema. But now she<br/>could if need be wear just about anything, from the most plain<br/>work-clothes to the most seductive dress, and had in fact done so<br/>on numerous occasions. It had started out small, a reason that<br/>necessitated wearing a leotard and tights outfit here, a blouse<br/>or skirt there, but each successive incident had served to make<br/>the next that much less daunting, that much more likely, until<br/>she reached the point that the prospects of appearing in public<br/>wearing the clothing of this gender held no terror for her<br/>anymore. A few years ago, the prospect of wearing the outfit she<br/>had worn on her departure from Nerima would have seemed shocking,<br/>almost sickening; the previous night, it had seemed everyday,<br/>almost anti-climactic. Granted, when it came to clothing she<br/>still had preferences (plain and unadorned were clearly her's),<br/>and there were still whole sartorial regions that made her<br/>uncomfortable, but when you came right down to it given a good<br/>enough reason she could wear just about anything, and every once<br/>in a while she found she didn't even need that. Somehow, that<br/>was downright scary.<p>She had tried to tell herself that they were just clothes, just<br/>pieces of cloth cut to fit on a body with certain proportions,<br/>that they really didn't signify anything. After all, look at<br/>Tsubasa and Konatsu, two of the most gender bending guys she<br/>knew. But yet, the problem was that deep down those two were<br/>still guys 100% of the time, and despite appearances still pretty<br/>much acted as such (especially around Ukyo). (S)he didn't have<br/>that luxury; because all it would take was a couple of drops of<br/>rain, and it was back to the girl form. Even if some of the<br/>conventions were ridiculous, biased, and otherwise outmoded, much<br/>of how a person was perceived and how they were treated by those<br/>around them was literally wrapped up in the way they dressed, so<br/>much so that Ranko could now see, with the perfect clarity of<br/>hindsight, that all the times she'd had to dress the part had<br/>also served to give her feminine self that much more room to grow<br/>and express. Like a vine, it had grown undetected in the<br/>foundation, and now suddenly was threatening to undermine the<br/>whole structure if it were removed.<p>She could remember the times clearly. When she was in girl form,<br/>and she caught herself in a heresy. When emotions flashed, and<br/>she felt herself drawn to raw feelings she had never experienced<br/>before, or had never dared allow herself to share. Like when<br/>Mikado kissed her, and she reacted less like a pissed off guy and<br/>more like a freaked-out girl; or when the whole Picolet affair<br/>seemed to be going horribly wrong, and the very real prospect<br/>emerged that she could end up married to a young man; or when<br/>that strange demon doppleganger of hers had challenged her to a<br/>"picking up guys contest", and she had accepted. In all of those<br/>times, she had felt the pull and resisted it, stifled the small<br/>voice that yearned for equal time, and plowed ahead in masculine<br/>certainty. She could feel the betraying little lurch inside of<br/>her that sometimes came when a complete stranger respectfully<br/>treated her as a girl, when an old woman complemented such a<br/>"courteous young lady", or even sometimes, more alarmingly, when<br/>a young man was looking her over appreciatively from several feet<br/>away. It was that pleasant feeling of acceptance, of<br/>acquiescence, that none of them knew wiser and as far as they<br/>were concerned she was just another girl, without all of the<br/>unique uncertainties dangling over her head, ready to crush.<p>It was a feeling that said being a girl wasn't all that bad, that<br/>it offered up possibilities she had never imagined as a guy, and<br/>that she was in a unique position and maybe it would be nice to<br/>explore the options just a little more.<p>The feeling was always crushed, but never fully eradicated. And<br/>the more she suppressed it, the stronger it would come back at<br/>some unsuspecting time. Like at night, when she was dreaming.<br/>At first the dreams came rarely, and only when she went to sleep<br/>in girl form. But in the last year they became more frequent,<br/>more demanding, and were coming even when sleeping as a guy,<br/>eating away at her subconscious and demanding to be paid<br/>attention to. The incident rate was going up. She'd sometimes<br/>find excuses to change into a girl, or to not change back. She'd<br/>wander aimlessly around town "just to get some exercise", and<br/>pass up numerous opportunities for hot water. Once she even<br/>found herself starring at Ryouga, telling herself that it was<br/>nothing more than professional interest that prompted her to note<br/>the shape of the musculature in his arms, his legs, his chest.<br/>She always told herself differently, emphatically, that she was<br/>not going over, but each time it happened she found it more<br/>difficult to explain away. As uncertainties began to mount, the<br/>need to find a cure was becoming more tantamount.<p>*So, why are you giving it free reign to take over?* the male<br/>part of her sneered. *This is the last thing you should be doing<br/>now! Go to China, get a cure, and be done with it all!*<p>*Yes, I know. That is what I should be doing.*<p>*So, why aren't you?*<p>*Because...* another part of her thought. She sighed in<br/>exasperation. *Because...*<p>The mantra repeated: *I'm / a / guy, / not / a / girl.*<p>*I'm / a / guy, / not / a / girl.*<p>*I'm / a / guy, / not / a ...*<p>*Because...* she thought quietly to herself. *It's become a part<br/>of me now. I don't know if I can give it up.*<p>*I'm / a / guy, / not / a / guy.*<p>*I'm / a / girl, / not / a / girl.*<p>*I'm / a / girl, / not / a / guy?*<p>*I'm / a / guy, / not / a / girl?*<p>*What about Akane?* the voice asked up. *Don't you love her?<br/>Don't you want to marry her?*<p>*Yes.*<p>*THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BETRAYING HER LIKE THIS?*<p>Her thoughts were suddenly silent. Glancing ahead, she suddenly<br/>realized that she was rapidly running out of jogging pavement.<br/>The street she was on was about to dead-end onto a bayside road<br/>that ran east along the shore of Kobe Bay, and as she arrived at<br/>the corner she noted that the road probably continued all the way<br/>toward the head of the bay and the Pacific coast. She ran in<br/>place among strangers while waiting for the light to change,<br/>trotted across the zebra crossing when it had, and took a turn<br/>east on the walkway along the coast, mostly because she had to<br/>choose a direction and at least that one looked the more<br/>pleasant.<p>She didn't answer herself for almost a kilometer.<p>*Because... because Akane deserves a full man, not half of one.*<p>*She says it doesn't matter. She loves you no matter what the<br/>form.*<p>*I know.*<p>*Then why...?*<p>*Because it matters to me.*<p>She stopped running. Taking deep breaths, she stood along the<br/>side of the walkway, and momentarily gazed at the blueish-grey<br/>bay. Then she began to slowly stretch her aching muscles.<p>*Because if I don't do this, I'll always have that uncertainty.<br/>I'll always wonder what I missed, what I didn't let myself do<br/>when I had the chance. I don't want to wake up ten years from<br/>now and wish fervently I was Ranko again, even for an afternoon.*<br/>Pant, pant, stretch. *I can't live this half-and-half life<br/>anymore. It's miserable. It's getting to the point that I no<br/>longer know who I am. I have to choose, and choose soon. I'm<br/>tired of the uncertainties. I hate uncertainties. I want<br/>answers.* Stretch, stretch, pant. *This is the only way I know to<br/>find them. I can't make a decision if I don't know what the<br/>answer is.*<p>*And what if you decide you like this? What if you decide you'd<br/>rather be female for the rest of your life? What will you tell<br/>Akane?*<p>*I'll have to tell her the truth. All of it.* She sighed. *That,<br/>I think, would be much better than living a lie for an entire<br/>life, don't you think?*<p>She stopped her stretching, and took stock of her surroundings.<br/>To her right she could see the docks in the distance, to her left<br/>the Pacific. She could see the skyline of Osaka across the bay,<br/>and the distant mountains behind the city. Kyoto was someplace<br/>nearby, but which direction she suddenly couldn't remember.<br/>She'd always wanted to visit the ancient capitol but had never<br/>had the chance, so perhaps sometime soon she might be able to.<p>She looked in the direction from whence she came. She thought<br/>she could probably find her way back to the apartment. It would<br/>make for an interesting afternoon, she decided, if she couldn't.<p>She took a deep breath, and found the conversation with herself<br/>had done nothing to lessen the pent up energy she felt she had.<br/>In fact, she suddenly felt as if it had been invigorated.<p>She started to jog back to the apartment.<p>*Look,* she promised herself, *the truth is, I don't think it's<br/>likely to happen. There are some aspects about this that I still<br/>don't know if I can live with. But I'm not going to find an<br/>answer by hanging around back home. This is the best, and only,<br/>way to know for certain. Besides... up until now, every major<br/>decision about my life has been made for me by others. I want to<br/>know I'm making the right decision, and making it on my own.*<p>*Three months. Three months out of an entire life, to find a<br/>truth. That's all I'm asking.*<p>*Three months?* the male part asked, skeptically.<p>*Three months. Tops. After that, China. I promise.*<p>*To do what, though?*<p>She didn't answer the question. Instead, she simply continued on<br/>her jog, the route to her destination still slightly uncertain.<p>But at least, she thought, she was going somewhere.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>There was a gentle knock on the door as Ranko carefully screwed<br/>the small bottle shut. In her window, the sky was ablaze with<br/>the orange and reds of the evening.<p>"Who is it?" she asked, voice raised and waving one hand<br/>frantically. "I can't exactly come to the door right at this<br/>moment."<p>"It's me, Fumiko." the familiar voice sounded from beyond the<br/>door. "I was just wondering how you were doing settling in."<p>Ranko glanced at the door. Sure enough, the locks were not in<br/>place. Old habits were hard to break. "Oh, come on in, then.<br/>The door's unlocked."<p>Fumiko stepped in and smiled at her neighbor, who had by now<br/>changed into a simple outfit of red shorts and yellow t-shirt.<br/>She glanced at the items on the desk the younger woman was<br/>sitting at. The faint tinge of acetate hung in the air. "Doing<br/>your nails, I see?" she observed.<p>Ranko stopped waving the one hand, and glanced down with mixed<br/>emotions at the drying red enamel on her fingernails. "Yeah."<br/>she said, unusually subdued. "I was, umm, getting ready to go<br/>out for interviews."<p>"You mean you've lined up something already?" Fumiko asked,<br/>slightly incredulous.<p>Ranko nodded in the negative. "I was just going to go out<br/>tomorrow and start looking, see where things lead me. Other than<br/>that, nothing yet."<p>"Oh." Fumiko said. "Well, I know you said you weren't<br/>interested, but I did some asking around at work today and found<br/>that they are looking to hire, so if you want to reconsider I can<br/>probably set-up an interview, maybe even tomorrow. That is, if<br/>you're willing..."<p>"To do what you do?" Ranko asked cautiously.<p>"Well, yeah."<p>Ranko considered. *Don't.* the male part of her said. *It's<br/>demeaning and beneath you. There are better things out there for<br/>you to do.*<p>*Yeah, but it's a job. It'll pay the rent, and I might be able<br/>to start work immediately. Besides, it's public exposure, right?<br/>I'll be out in the open, interacting with people. Which is part<br/>of the point of this exercise, isn't it?*<p>*Isn't it?*<p>If her male psyche could shrug it would have done so. Instead,<br/>it merely sulked.<p>Ranko looked back up at her helpful neighbor. "Well, maybe."<br/>She sighed. "I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least interview<br/>for it."<p>"No, probably not." She smiled. "Want me to set it up?"<p>This time, Ranko did the shrug. "Yeah, might as well. I suppose<br/>I've got nothing to loose. Want to give me the details?"<p>"Are your nails dry, yet?"<p>Ranko experimentally tapped the surface of one. Sure enough, it<br/>was firm. "Yes. This stuff is quick drying. Why?"<p>"Then put something on, I'll treat for dinner, and we can discuss<br/>it over food. Right now I want to just get out of here and get<br/>something to eat."<p>Ranko nodded. "Sounds like a plan to me. Wait a moment, I'll<br/>find something."<p>As the redhead went over to her closet, Fumiko continued. "Oh,<br/>by the way. I understand Mrs. Hayakawa called downstairs and<br/>left messages. She says she'll be back tomorrow."<p>"Oh, that's good." Ranko said, examining her meager wardrobe and<br/>selecting a couple of items, mostly because they were easy to put<br/>on.<p>Fumiko watched as the younger woman put on a white blouse and<br/>started to button. "Didn't you say you needed to talk to her<br/>about something?" she asked.<p>Ranko nodded, seemed to hesitate, then reached for the other item<br/>she had set mentally aside, a black skirt of about knee length,<br/>one of the ones she had purchased the day before. "Oh, yeah."<br/>she mumbled, as she began to step into it, then brought the<br/>waistband up to her waist. "I did, but not anymore." Once at<br/>the waist she zippered up the side, ending with a snap. "I took<br/>care of things this afternoon. No need to bother her." Then,<br/>unconsciously, the hand that had just zippered herself up now<br/>slowly smoothed the garment to make it more presentable. "No, no<br/>need to bother her at all."<p>For a moment, Fumiko thought the girl was staring into space.<br/>Then, she looked down at herself, shook her head as if to clear<br/>something, and smiled.<p>"Come on, lets go. I want to get out of here."<p>END PART THREE<p>
