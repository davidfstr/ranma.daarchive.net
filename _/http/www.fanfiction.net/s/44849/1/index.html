</div>Standard copyright disclaimers apply. I have no money, so don't<br/>sue.<p>Of Choices and Chances (1/?)<br/>by GT Ranma-Chan<p>He'd planned it for months, ever since he realized what the<br/>problem was. At least since the failed wedding.<p>He'd always been taught to face his problems head-on, to look<br/>them in the face and never shirk away. That's why this solution<br/>made the most sense to him; he had to do it this way, to confront<br/>his problem directly in order to vanquish it. It was the only<br/>way he could think of to deal with the issue once and for all, to<br/>finally put to rest the dreams and uncertainties that had haunted<br/>him for years.<p>To finally be whole again.<p>It was early evening in the early summer, and Ranma realized that<br/>if he was going to do this he needed to work quickly. For once<br/>he was alone in the house: Kasumi was out on her date with Dr.<br/>Tofu, Nabiki had elected to stay at the University for a few<br/>extra weeks, and so was not around; Mom, Pop, and Mr. Tendou were<br/>out doing whatever it was adults did when their children were not<br/>looking; and Akane had decided to spend time with some of her<br/>high school friends, one last get-together before everyone<br/>started to drift away in post-graduation diaspora. He had only a<br/>few precious hours to accomplish his disappearing act, and he<br/>needed to use that time wisely; no telling when someone might<br/>return, or when he might get another chance.<p>Ranma sighed, and shoved the envelope under Akane's door. For a<br/>few moments he stared at the duck with her name on it, and tried<br/>to recall the exact words he'd used on the note. He'd written<br/>things there that he had never quite been able to put into voiced<br/>words before, and now that he had committed himself to a paper<br/>record he actually felt good about having finally done so. He<br/>didn't, of course, tell her everything, just the basic plan of<br/>departing for China to find a cure, or at least a bath in Spring<br/>of Drowned Man. That part was true enough, so he wasn't starting<br/>his new-found confidence with her by lying. But at the same<br/>time, neither did he mention the little "detour" he planned, nor<br/>how long he expected said detour to take. Or what he feared that<br/>detour might reveal about himself. That would probably still be<br/>too much for her to take, and some things he thought were still<br/>best left unsaid.<p>He took one last sigh, and turned away from her door. If there<br/>was going to be any hope of a future with her, he told himself,<br/>he needed to do this, needed to get it out of his system. To go<br/>someplace where no one knew him, and find out for certain. It<br/>was the only way. He needed to confront this problem directly,<br/>and to do so somewhere where conflicting agendas were not around<br/>to interfere. That meant he had to do it alone, had to do it<br/>(for honor's sake) far from everyone he knew, and (equally for<br/>honor's sake) could not tell them what it was he planned.<br/>Distantly, though, he had one true fear: that in his absence, the<br/>girl of his dreams would end up choosing another, and that he<br/>would be going through all of this for nothing.<p>*No.* he caught himself. *Not for nothing. You would still have<br/>to face this sometime in your life no matter what; putting it off<br/>will just make it worse.* And then, another voice in his head, a<br/>little softer: *Have faith in her, and she will have faith in<br/>you.*<p>Ranma returned to his room.<p>Another envelope lay on his desk, with a letter to the house as a<br/>whole. For a moment he argued with himself as to where would be<br/>the best place to leave it before he departed. He wanted to make<br/>certain that it would not only be found, but found by someone<br/>responsible enough to not try to keep it a secret; the last thing<br/>he needed was to be brought back kicking and screaming "before he<br/>did anything foolish", something which he thought was a distinct<br/>possibility if he left the note for Pop or Mr. Tendou. After<br/>consideration he chose Kasumi and so wrote her name on the<br/>envelope, and decided to leave it on the kitchen table on the way<br/>out.<p>That left only one thing to do.<p>He went to his closet, and pulled out the backpack. It was new,<br/>the kind used generally by college students to carry their hefty<br/>book loads and everything else in their lives. It was already<br/>stuffed with all the things he intended to take with him.<br/>Clothes, mostly. A book or two to keep him occupied on the<br/>journey. And most importantly, some 250,000 Yen he had slowly<br/>accumulated over the last year. All packed away days before,<br/>awaiting the chance he had realized he was about to have to<br/>execute his plan. A storage locker at the train station also<br/>housed another suitcase, equally stuffed; he would have to pick<br/>that up before he left town, but his plans already encompassed<br/>that particular move. All he needed to do now was to get out of<br/>the house, and make good his escape before anyone noticed.<p>He glanced at the clock. He wasn't going to make the next train,<br/>he thought, but he probably could make the one after that. The<br/>sooner the better, he realized, before everyone went out looking<br/>for him.<p>He riffled through the backpack one last time, making certain<br/>several items were near the top for when he needed them. Then he<br/>zippered the pack closed, put the pack on his shoulders, picked<br/>up the envelope, and departed the room. Down the stairs, he<br/>paused at the kitchen table before placing the envelope there,<br/>leaning against a vase of flowers. With luck, it would be a<br/>hours before Kasumi came back from her date, and in the<br/>intervening time if anyone noticed he was gone he hoped that they<br/>wouldn't consider it too out of the ordinary.<p>He paused once more, and took one last look around the house.<p>Three years. That was how long he'd lived here, longer in one<br/>spot than since any time he could remember. On some level he<br/>felt a pang at his departure, since he had no idea when it was<br/>he'd see it again. Hopefully soon, but there were no guarantees.<br/>He would keep in contact; that much he'd promised them, although<br/>he also knew that he wouldn't do so regularly and certainly not<br/>revealing any contact information to his end in the process.<br/>He'd have to be careful about that when he was on his detour; the<br/>last thing he wanted was for them to find out about his real<br/>plan, and show up out of the blue.<p>The sky was an ever-blackening dark blue when he stepped outside.<br/>Quickly, he made his way out the front entrance and turned in the<br/>direction he had already planned, all the time running.<br/>Everything depended on how fast he could disappear, how fast he<br/>could not be recognized. To do that he needed to make his way to<br/>the spot he had scouted out weeks before, so he could make his<br/>transition. And to do that while the window of opportunity was<br/>still open, he had to do it now.<p>Twenty minutes of quick jogging later, he arrived at the spot: a<br/>clump of trees and shrubbery in the park, slightly off the beaten<br/>track. The immense foliage formed a rough ring around an alcove<br/>of flat grass, a perfect hiding spot for a few minutes of<br/>privacy. Nearby was the pond, and not much beyond that a public<br/>ladies room, both of which made the hidden alcove that much more<br/>perfect a location. With determination to see it through and a<br/>fair degree of nervousness, Ranma took a waterbottle from his<br/>backpack and filled it with water, then made his way toward the<br/>clump of trees. Pausing at the edge of the tree-line, he<br/>listened carefully to make certain no one else (probably some<br/>pair of lovers, looking for a quick place of privacy) had chosen<br/>that inopportune moment to occupy his chosen spot. Thankfully he<br/>could hear no one, so Ranma continued carefully into the brush.<p>The first thing he did was to splash the water on himself,<br/>causing a change in pronoun. Then with the change complete she<br/>set upon her next task, that of stripping off her clothes. The<br/>red Chinese shirt came off first, then the black pants. Both<br/>were rolled up into a combined cloth log. Next, she opened her<br/>backpack and began to grab for the items that she had previously<br/>set for easy reach. First came the bra, which she put on with a<br/>fair degree of reluctance. *Get used to it,* were the words she<br/>used to move her forward, *because you'll be wearing these for<br/>the foreseeable future.* Next came a pair of white cotton<br/>panties, which she put on in record time after taking off her<br/>boxer shorts in equally record time; she didn't feel the need to<br/>make that particular change of clothes last any longer than it<br/>had to. Finally, she fished out a neatly folded yellow sundress,<br/>the kind many young women were wearing now that the weather was<br/>warm. With a degree of hesitation she let it drop-unfold, then<br/>unzipped the back and stepped into it, willing herself to<br/>continue forward the entire time. After fumbling around for a<br/>few second, she managed to get the zipper back up, then adjusted<br/>the lay of the dress to make it more comfortable.<p>Flat shoes and a pair of pink-fringed white socks completed the<br/>outfit. Then, she put her old clothes into the backpack, taking<br/>a few extra minutes to double and triple-check that she wasn't<br/>leaving anything behind. Confident that all was now retrieved,<br/>she made her way carefully out of the brush, now taking care to<br/>loop both straps of the backpack over one shoulder, in the purse-<br/>like manner she'd seen other girls carry their backpacks. It was<br/>now essential that she try as much as possible to emulate those<br/>mannerisms, lest she draw attention to herself and possibly be<br/>recognized. She'd originally planned on making the switch at the<br/>Tendou residence, but decided against it when she realized she<br/>might be spotted on the way out in her current form by one of the<br/>neighbors. Not that seeing her girl form around the neighborhood<br/>was anything unusual, but because it might give her extended<br/>family a clue about what had happened. She didn't want to give<br/>them any hints, so she decided holding off until she was safely<br/>off-premises was a much better idea.<p>One last thing to do. She hung around the ladies public restroom<br/>building for a few moments, trying to ascertain if there was<br/>anyone else in there at that hour. It was now dark, so the<br/>number of people in the park was now less, but time to the train<br/>was also running out so she decided to just plunge ahead. Again,<br/>luck was with her; the restroom was vacant.<p>She went to a sink, then propped her backpack up next to an<br/>adjacent sink, opened a side pouch, pulled out a few items, then<br/>turned to the mirror.<p>It was appalling, she thought detachedly, at some of the skills<br/>she'd acquired since she'd gotten this rotten curse. She thought<br/>this as she tipped a bottle of foundation into her hands, then<br/>rubbed some of the light beige liquid onto her face with her<br/>fingers. Next came a quick dab of blue eye shadow, a thin line<br/>of eyeliner, some mascara, a little rouge brushed on the cheeks,<br/>and finally some rather red lipstick that made her lips feel<br/>oily. A few touch-ups and some powder, and she was finished with<br/>her quick session of make-up.<p>She put the items back into the backpack, then reached behind her<br/>head and methodically began to undo her braids. It took a few<br/>minutes, but after some painful tugging the task was done. She<br/>used a few strokes from a brush to bring some of the more unruly<br/>areas in line, then fished some hair pins and a scrunchie out<br/>from her backpack. Her hair was soon tied back, but hung more<br/>loose than was normal for it. Finally, she reached once more<br/>into her backpack, and withdrew a pair of clip-on earrings and a<br/>heart-shaped pendant necklace.<p>She stepped back to examine herself in the mirror.<p>A girl was starring back. A pretty girl, young, sweet, shapely,<br/>and very, very feminine. Thin, shapely legs came down from a<br/>hemline barely at the knees. Her lips were red, pouty, almost<br/>kissable. Her hair hung behind her, its full, red, voluminous<br/>body hanging almost down to her trim waist. A necklace hung from<br/>her neck, its pendant almost nestled between the hint of cleavage<br/>revealed by the sundress' plunging neckline. She looked<br/>beautiful, desirable, a girl on the verge of full-grown<br/>womanhood.<p>And (s)he was that girl.<p>*No turning back.* she told herself, even as her stomach yawned<br/>open and felt like it was plummeting. *You know you have to do<br/>this.*<p>She watched herself nod back in the reflection. She'd known it<br/>for some time now, known this was coming. She'd tried to kid<br/>herself otherwise, tried to tell herself different, tried to say<br/>that no matter what the exterior looked like, the interior was<br/>and always would be the same. Even when she caught herself<br/>thinking otherwise, even when she found herself jolting awake in<br/>the middle of the night from the dreams, she tried to deny what<br/>other parts of her psyche were screaming for her to notice.<br/>Now... now she was quickly heading for an intersection from which<br/>she would have to choose a path, and for the sake of someone she<br/>cared for very much she needed to know the answer now. It was<br/>just almost within her power now to obtain her cure, but before<br/>she did that she needed to know for certain which cure she was<br/>reaching for.<p>She looked at herself in the mirror once more, nodded one last<br/>time in acknowledgment, then gathered up the last of her things.<p>As she stepped out into the night, she paused one last time, took<br/>a breath, and brought forth the first few steps of this new life.<br/>A temporary one, she hoped, but there was that persistent,<br/>nagging voice in the back of her mind that wondered how temporary<br/>it was. She dismissed it immediately, not wanting to think about<br/>those implications.<p>"You've got what you wanted, Ranko." she said quietly to herself,<br/>as she made her way briskly out of the park and toward the train<br/>station. Ahead, she could see the building in the distance.<br/>"You've got your chance."<p>"Now... make your case."<p>END OF PART ONE<p>There, I hope you like this little excursion. Comments would be<br/>appreciated. Additional chapters will be forthcoming as soon as<br/>I get around to writing them.<p>Anything else I forgot?<p>GT Ranma-Chan<br/>gt_ranma_<p>
