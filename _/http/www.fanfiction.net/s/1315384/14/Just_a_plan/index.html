</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>The heat wave has finally subsided. That really zapped my creativity for a<br/>while. On with the review response.<br/>dogbertcarroll: just wait and see.<br/>Sterling-Ag: I know the deception is going a bit far. There are some<br/>developments in this chapter about that. Deception and<br/>misunderstandings are still the main theme of this story though.<br/>Materia-Blade: The yu-gi-oh thing was just a joke. Hero is the big brother<br/>that's hitting on everything female within a two mile radius.<br/>Kinai: Sorry, no Akane in this chapter. You have to wait for chapter 15 for<br/>that.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XIV<br/>First step<p>Ranma eyed the girls surrounding her nervously. Her eyes finally rested<br/>on the one with the twin blonde ponytail.<p>"Eeuh. So, what do you want?" The red head asked hesitantly.<p>"We want to know who you are." Sailor Mars demanded immediately. She<br/>glared suspicion at the girl before her.<p>"Mars! Don't be mean to her!" Sailor moon scolded. "She helped us<br/>remember."<p>"That doesn't mean she is on our side meatball head." Mars responded<br/>with a glare.<p>Sailor moon huffed. "I don't care. She and her friend saved me today. She<br/>has to be on our side." The two girls started trading glares.<p>Meanwhile Ranma became increasingly more nervous as the argument<br/>between the two girls continued.<p>As Mars temper got the better of her, she took a step forward as if she<br/>was going to choke Sailor Moon. The blonde girl having lots of experience<br/>with the particular look Mars was directing at her, because of all the<br/>Manga she 'borrowed' quickly took a few steps backward. True to form,<br/>her feet seemed to find the nearest irregularity and she tripped. With a<br/>shriek and flailing arms, she toppled over dragging the red head with her.<br/>Both girls landed on the ground with a thud in an entanglement of arms<br/>and legs.<p>Meanwhile Ranma-chan really started to panic. Being in a situation like<br/>this many times before she knew this would either end painful or in total<br/>embarrassment. She closed her eyes and cringed in anticipation of her<br/>impending doom. When after a few seconds she didn't get slapped or<br/>pummeled she slowly opened her eyes. She was greeted by a pair of<br/>dauntingly familiar sky bleu eyes staring right back at her only inches<br/>away from her own. Ranma-chan blinked a couple of times trying to clear<br/>the fog that was clouding the connection she was trying to make. Then it<br/>all clicked into place. There was only one person she knew that could trip<br/>like that.<p>"Usagi?"<p>The blonde girl crooked her head to one side, untangled one of her arms<br/>and lifted the mask the red headed girl below her was wearing.<p>"Ranma?" She exclaimed surprised.<p>Both girls just stared at each other in total surprise.<p>* * *<p>Kasumi was humming a merry tune while cutting some vegetables in<br/>preparation for lunch. There wouldn't be many people eating here today.<br/>With Ranma and Akane gone for the summer most of the craziness around<br/>the Tendo dojo had died down as well. It was kind of boring nowadays.<br/>Kasumi had gotten used to strange people visiting and the general<br/>weirdness that surrounded it. It was exhilarating and entertaining to<br/>watch the antics of Akane and her fiancée. They always seemed to have<br/>such a good time with there friends. Her train of thought was interrupted<br/>when the phone started ringing. Quickly washing her hands and drying<br/>them, she exited the kitchen to answer the call.<p>"Hello? Tendo residence speaking." Kasumi listened to the callers replay<br/>and was surprised aunty Saotome was calling.<p>"Hello there aunty Saotome. How are you and Ranma doing in Juuban?"<br/>Listening to Nodoka's story she got a worried frown on her face.<p>"I don't believe Ranma would actually go as far as too get a boyfriend<br/>aunty. Perhaps it is best if I visit though. Would tomorrow morning be<br/>convenient?"<p>She got an affirmative answer.<p>"Alright aunty. I will see you tomorrow. I have the address you are<br/>staying right here. It won't be a problem to find it. Bye."<p>With that, she ended the conversation. She put a finger too her chin in a<br/>thoughtful gesture. Although she never actually believed Ranma would get<br/>herself a boyfriend it would be nice to get out of the house for once.<br/>Perhaps she would even meet one of those famous Sailor Senshi when she<br/>was in Juuban. Kasumi smiled.<p>* * *<p>Five real and one neo Senshi were roof hoping across the Juuban district<br/>towards a well-known Shinto temple. The group had left the park after a<br/>couple of reporters showed up. Keeping a close eye on the red head they<br/>now knew was Ranma they had headed off. Sailor Moon and Mars had<br/>argued over there destination but Moon had insisted they could trust<br/>Ranma. Giving that Sailor Moon had a gift to see the good in people and<br/>they remembered what Luna said about Ranma the group was convinced<br/>to take the red head to there regular meeting place at Rei's temple.<p>After a couple of minutes, they reached the trees surrounding the shrine<br/>and disappeared from sight. The five inner Senshi started to glow and<br/>reverted back to there civilian guise. Ranma just became a blur of motion<br/>using the amagurikan speed to change in the span of a couple of seconds.<p>Ranma-chan was surprised to see the other Senshi where all friends of<br/>Usagi she already met. It made kind of sense though now that she<br/>thought about it. She just didn't understand why she couldn't see it<br/>before. It was so obvious now that she knew. It must be some kind of<br/>magic she concluded.<p>All six of them gathered inside. Rei brought in some tea and cookies.<br/>When every body was seated, all attention was once again focused on<br/>Ranma-chan. She nervously scratched the back of her head.<p>"Sorry about this." She said in a meek voice.<p>"Ranma?" Usagi tried to calm the nerves girl in front of her. "We just like<br/>to know how you became a Sailor Senshi."<p>Ranma grinned sheepishly. "I'm not."<p>"What do you mean your not?" A disembodied voice asked.<p>Ranma-chan looked around looking for source of the unfamiliar voice<br/>when the two lunar cats strode into view.<p>"Ack! Cat!" Ranma-chan's first reflex was to run but then she noticed that<br/>the normal terror that would fuel that desire was absent. She was still a<br/>little afraid but not terrified. She stopped and blinked a couple of times.<br/>Then a grin appeared on her face.<p>"Cool! Not scary cats!"<p>Suddenly Luna and Artemis where met with two bleu eyes that closely<br/>examined them. Ranma-chan hesitantly reached with her hand and<br/>touched the white cat.<p>"Boo." The white cat said.<p>"Whaaaa!" Ranma-chan immediately jumped back making warding<br/>gestures with her hands. "Nice kitty, nice kitty, nice kitty." She chanted.<p>Artemis got a smack from Luna. "Be nice Artemis. Or you will be sleeping<br/>outside for a month." She said with a stern voice.<p>This got her some funny looks from the girls but she ignored them.<p>The black cat turned back towards Ranma and tried to calm her down with<br/>a gentle voice.<p>"Calm down Ranma. We're not going to hurt you."<p>Ranma-chan calmed down a little and looked at the two cats with<br/>suspicion.<p>"Are you sure?"<p>"Yes Ranma." Luna calmly replied. "Pleas sit down so we can continue our<br/>conversation. We would like to know what you meant when you said you<br/>weren't a Senshi."<p>Ranma-chan complied and took her seat. She thought a moment about<br/>what the black cat had said.<p>"I'm not sure what you mean by not understanding I'm not a Senshi. I<br/>just told you I'm not. I'm a martial artist."<p>That drew some confused looks from the girls and the two cats. Rei<br/>frowned and asked the next question.<p>"What do you mean you're a martial artist? There is no way a martial<br/>artist could do what we have seen you do."<p>Ranma-chan frowned at the black haired girl. If there was anything she<br/>couldn't stand, it was someone who questioned her abilities.<p>"Of course I can. Every competent martial artist that can focus his Ki can<br/>do that. I'm just the best." She said with confidence.<p>"What?" Rei shrieked. "There is no way you did that with just Ki! I use a<br/>little Ki in my fire readings and that took years too master!"<p>Ranma-chan just snorted. "Just because you're no good at it doesn't mean<br/>somebody else can't." She replied and thus proving the Saotome foot in<br/>the mouth technique was still intact.<p>If looks could kill, Ranma-chan would be a smoldering heap from the<br/>flaming gaze Rei was directing at her.<p>Ami meanwhile was thinking about what Ranma had said. The conclusion<br/>she reached was quite astounding.<p>"You mean you got your abilities with training?" She asked the red head.<p>Ranma broke her glaring contest with Rei and turned towards Ami.<p>"That's right. I've trained in my family's style for years and build up my Ki<br/>reserves."<p>"Maybe Ranma could train us." Makoto said with enthusiasm. If she got as<br/>strong as that with just training, think of what it could do for us.<p>"I can't" the red head interrupted. She shrugged her shoulders in apology.<br/>"I'm not licensed to teach in my family art and even if I was, it will take<br/>yours too long get to the level I'm at."<p>Makoto slumped in disappointment.<p>Ami contemplated this. "There is still a slight trace of magic showing in my<br/>scans though." She said thoughtfully.<p>Ranma-chan looked uncomfortable again.<p>"And I want too hear all about that boyfriend of yours." Usagi said with a<br/>twinkle in her eyes.<p>Ranma-chan was really uncomfortable now.<p>"Usagi? Can I talk to you for a minute? Privately I mean?"<p>Usagi looked a little confused by the request and the timid voice Ranma<br/>asked the question with but she agreed. The red head grabbed her hand<br/>and dragged her friend too the bathroom making sure to bring some of<br/>her tea. When the two of them where inside Ranma-chan carefully closed<br/>the door. She sighed.<p>"There is something I have to show you. Something I haven't told you<br/>about because I was afraid you wouldn't want to be a friend anymore."<br/>She said with some sadness in her voice.<p>"Can you hand me a towel please." Ranma-chan asked. Usagi complied<br/>and looked confused when Ranma-chan quickly stripped of most of her<br/>clothing and wrapped the towel around her self.<p>Ranma-chan sighed. "I really don't want anybody to know about what I'm<br/>going to show you. You're the only one I would have consider telling and<br/>only if it was necessary like now."<p>Usagi looked even more confused by the minute. Her eyes went wide<br/>when Ranma-chan dumped the remainder of her tea on top of her head<br/>transforming from her to him.<p>"Wow." She said. "I didn't know you where a starlight?"<p>It was now Ranma who was confused. This was not the kind of reaction he<br/>had anticipated.<p>"What's a starlight?" He asked.<p>* * *<p>Pluto was satisfied with the progress of her escape plan. Daring her captor<br/>to create more and more excitingly game environments wasn't hard. With<br/>the help of the techniques she had found in the book, it wasn't difficult to<br/>distract her opponent. A couple of seconds with every distraction was all<br/>she needed. She stole small amounts of energy from the game<br/>environments, careful not to be noticed. It took time and the amounts of<br/>energy she stole weren't that big, but her supply grew steadily. Hiding<br/>that supply of energy was the difficult part though. The bigger it got the<br/>more noticeable it would be. That was the risky part of her plan, keeping<br/>it a secret from her captor. Her main plan was to keep him to occupied to<br/>notice. This included letting him win a couple of games. Just enough to<br/>keep him interested though. Pluto didn't like to lose. And cheating was<br/>actually beginning to get fun. She almost burst out laughing when she<br/>discovered her captor was most definitely male. At least that was the<br/>impression she got when he almost fainted when she showed him an<br/>impressive amount of her cleavage. She smiled inwardly. That had been<br/>something she would never have imagined doing before her capture. It<br/>wouldn't be long though. Soon she would be free again. A grin appeared<br/>on her face.<p>"You lose again. Shall we play another game?" She said sweetly.<p>"Grrrrrr."<p>* * *<p>END PART XIV<p>Additional authors note:<br/>More revelations in the next chapter. And what is this? Akane goes<br/>shopping for Sailor Senshi merchandise? See you next time when the<br/>insanity continues.
