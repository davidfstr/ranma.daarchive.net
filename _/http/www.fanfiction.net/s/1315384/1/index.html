</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean there not mine! Are you sure?<p>Part I<br/>The plan<p>Ranma was sitting on the roof of the Tendo dojo. There was nothing<br/>unusual about that. Except this time it would be a while before he<br/>would be back. He didn't know if he should be happy or sad. Leaving<br/>Nerima would mean leaving all the chaos behind. Something he<br/>desperately wanted. It would also mean leaving the only home he had<br/>known for the past year. He just didn't think he had a choice. After the<br/>failed wedding he just blew up. It was the first time he really lost his<br/>temper and he never wanted it to happen again. He was glad his<br/>mother came up with the idea for him to get away during summer<br/>break. After experiencing the bombed wedding and learning this was<br/>almost a normal routine in Ranma's live Nodoka was furious. She felt<br/>action had to be taken. And after Ranma actually lost his temper she<br/>felt the need more pressing. So she came up with the idea of taking<br/>Ranma with her. As expected Soun wailed about how the schools<br/>would never be joined and Genma bellowed something about family<br/>honor. His mother had put her foot down.<p>"Genma, you had him for the past 10 yours and now it is my turn!"<p>The steel katana was another incentive of course. His father was still<br/>cowering in his panda form from that confrontation. The fiancées<br/>where wise enough to stay away for a while. Ranma was still mad at<br/>them for almost hurting his mother. Shampoo's actions he could<br/>almost understand with here 'kill all obstacles' attitude. But Ukyo...?<p>What was she thinking! Fortunately the school year was over and he<br/>did not have to deal with her on a daily basis. Not yet anyway. He<br/>would go away for awhile and... actually he did not know where he<br/>would be going. His mother thought it best she was the only one to<br/>know for now. That left him with only one problem. One he avoided<br/>thinking about until now.<p>Akane...<p>After his blowup she became somewhat subdued. He knew it was<br/>because of him. Things were said in anger. Because of his loss of<br/>control he couldn't remember them clearly. They didn't have their<br/>usual arguments lately and conversations where down to a bare<br/>minimum. Akane seemed to avoid him at every opportunity.<p>Ranma sighed. His mind was going in circles like this. With fluid<br/>motions he walked to the edge of the roof, only slightly hesitating<br/>above Akane's room. Entering the guestroom his usual way, by means<br/>of the window, he got ready for bed. His father was already snoring in<br/>his panda form.<p>He could swear his pop spent more time sleeping as a panda then a<br/>human being. It seemed almost poetic for the lazy old fool. Yawning<br/>he lay down on his futon and was promptly asleep.<p>***<p>The next morning started as usual. Like clockwork the two Saotome's<br/>started their morning sparing sessions. At least that was what Genma<br/>liked to think. For Ranma it was his usual morning 'beat the panda'<br/>workout. He could easily defeat his pop nowadays. This was especially<br/>true after Saffron. His aura control had increased leaps and bounds<br/>after that.<p>As expected a loud splash was heard and one instant panda, just add<br/>water, wobbled to the porch to dry his fur.<p>"You're getting slow old man. That wasn't even a warm up." Ranma<br/>laughed.<p>The panda pulled out a sign.<p>[Show some respect for you elder boy]<p>Ranma snorted and walked inside to get some breakfast. The Tendo<br/>patriarch was sitting at the table his head hidden behind a newspaper.<br/>Nabiki walked in watching groggily while holding a cup of coffee. She<br/>was not a morning person. Kasumi smiling as always serving Ranma<br/>his breakfast.<p>"Ranma, your mother just called. She will be here in one hour. You<br/>better hurry with breakfast and get your things packed."<p>"Thanks Kasumi" Ranma responded. Digging into his food with gusto<br/>he finished in record time.<p>He looked around the room after cleaning out his rice bowl. He<br/>blinked.<p>"Where is Akane?"<p>"I think she is still in here room." The eldest daughter said.<p>Ranma sighed. He really wanted to talk to her but she still seemed to<br/>avoid him.<p>"Thanks for breakfast Kasumi. It was wonderful as always."<p>"Your welcome Ranma-kun. Would you like me to prepare some<br/>lunches for you and your mother to take with you?" Kasumi asked.<p>"That would be great. I'd better started packing now." Rising from the<br/>table he headed for the stairs. He spared a quick glance towards<br/>Akane's door when he walked past. Somewhat downcast he reached<br/>his room to gather his things. Even after living here for more than a<br/>year he still didn't own much. Just a couple of his trademark Chinese<br/>outfits. He smirked, even his female wardrobe was bigger than this.<br/>He paused. He didn't notice at first but he had started packing a<br/>couple of dresses as well. Most of them where bought when his mother<br/>was visiting, and he had to hide as 'Ranko'. He smiled a little. They<br/>where gifts from his mother, even if she did not know at the time. It<br/>wouldn't be right to just leave them here. He didn't mind his female<br/>form that much anymore. He only protested out of habit nowadays<br/>because it was expected of him. And if he had to be a girl sometimes<br/>she might as well look GOOD as a girl. It didn't take long after that<br/>before his pack was ready.<p>The doorbell rang. Somewhat unusual since most visitors these days<br/>had the habit of crashing through walls. As always Kasumi answered<br/>the door.<p>"Aunty Saotome! Please come in. Ranma should be ready in a minute."<p>"Why thank you Kasumi. I believe there is my son now."<p>Ranma, having heard his mother's voice, came down the stairs<br/>carrying his pack.<p>"Hi mom. I have everything I need so I'm ready to go. Let me just say<br/>goodbye first."<p>He said a quick goodbye to the Tendo's and his father, giving Kasumi a<br/>hug. He was about to turn to the door when a bedroom door opened<br/>and Akane stormed downstairs. The startled Ranma found himself in a<br/>tight hug from the smaller dark-haired girl.<p>"Just stay out of trouble." She whispered in his ear. Then she was<br/>gone leaving a baffled Ranma behind. He looked down at his hands<br/>where Akane had pressed a small package wrapped in plain brown<br/>paper.<p>"Come along Ranma. It's time we go." His mother said. Together they<br/>left the dojo compound and headed towards the train station.<p>"Where are we going mom? You haven't told me before."<p>His mother smiled. "I had the good fortune to meet an old friend of<br/>mine. She is currently away for an extended stay in the U.S. and<br/>allowed me to use of her apartment in Juuban."<p>Ranma blinked. "Juuban? Sounds like a nice place. Should be more<br/>peaceful then Nerima."<p>Arriving at the train station Nodoka perched some tickets and they<br/>boarded their train. With a sigh of relief Ranma dropped in his seat. He<br/>had finally some rest for a while. He remembered the package Akane<br/>had given him. Now seemed like a good time to open it. Pulling it from<br/>his pocket he carefully opened it. It contained a letter in Akane's<br/>handwriting and a pendent. He was somewhat puzzled. He picked up<br/>the letter and started to read.<p>-<br/>Dear Ranma,<br/>When you read this letter, you should be well on your way to where<br/>ever your mother is taking you. I know we haven't talked much lately<br/>and that is way I am writing this letter. I was avoiding you because I<br/>needed to sort out some of my own feelings. I could not face you at<br/>the time. You were still mad at me because I knew about the cask at<br/>the wedding. I know now I shouldn't have kept it from you. It was<br/>your choice after all. I guess I was just a little selfish and afraid you<br/>would leave me. The pendant that is included in the package is my<br/>penance for that. It's not a cure. The shopkeeper that sold me this told<br/>me it had the ability to suppress a curse. It should keep you from<br/>being splashed all the time. You still change when you come in contact<br/>with water but it should keep the random changes to a minimum. I will<br/>be staying with two of my cousins this summer. They life in the<br/>peaceful countryside outside Tokyo city. I haven't seen them for<br/>years. You can find the address at the bottom of this letter. If you<br/>want me to we can write each other.<p>I love you.<br/>Akane<p>This was not something Ranma had expected. He picked up the<br/>pendent and looked at it. It was a sapphire stone shaped like an<br/>upside down obelisk. It seemed to shine with an inner light. It was<br/>attached to a chain made from thin silver shackles. He was wondering<br/>how he was supposed to carry it when an idea struck him. He quickly<br/>braided the chain in his pigtail leaving the stone at the end. His mother<br/>raised an eyebrow when she noticed this and directed a questioning<br/>look in his direction. He smiled at her and handed her the letter.<br/>After reading it she send a warm smile in the direction of her son.<p>"I'm happy for you Ranma. As soon as we arrive at the apartment you<br/>can write her a letter, ok?"<p>"Thanks mom. I would like that."<p>The train pulled in the Juuban train station. Mother and son<br/>disembarked and worked there way to the exit.<p>"Ranma. There are some important things I have to tell you." Nodoka<br/>laid a hand on her sons arm to get his full attention.<p>"While we are here I want you to keep yourself in check. The people<br/>here are not used to high powered martial artist like in Nerima."<p>Ranma tried to say something but his mother interrupted.<p>"I know Ranma. Genma thought you everything is training right? You<br/>can see this as a training exercise in self-control. Unless you think<br/>you're not up to it." The last thing was said with a slight smile.<p>The pigtailed martial artist sputtered. "Hey!"<p>His mother's smile broadened.<p>"Let's get to the apartment building son. It's already getting late"<p>They where about to enter Juuban Park when they noticed something<br/>unusual; a monster that looked like it consisted of mud roughly shaped<br/>in a human form was fighting a couple of girls in really short skirts.<br/>Ranma blinked. It wasn't the unusual outfits that got his attention. He<br/>had worn weirder stuff himself after all. The bunny costume came to<br/>mind. It was rater the powerful auras these girls seemed to emit. One<br/>of the girls wearing a red skirt let loose some sort of fire attack<br/>reducing the monster to dust. Immediate afterwards the group of girls<br/>seemed to be surrounded by a mob of reporters.<p>His mother gasped and looked starry eyed to the group of girls. Ranma<br/>grew a large sweatdrop.<p>"Those are the famous sailor scouts." She squealed like a teenager.<br/>She was obviously a big fan.<p>"Sailor scouts?" Ranma asked dumb struck.<p>"Why yes!" His mother answered "They fight for love and justice and<br/>have saved many people. You see Ranma; there is nothing to worry<br/>about while you are staying here. Now come along, we are almost near<br/>the apartment."<p>***<p>Ranma was laying on a western style bed in the apartment's<br/>guestroom. He sulked, although he would never admit that. A bunch of<br/>girl's with weird powers got all the fun trashing monsters while his<br/>mother wanted him to keep safe. It just wasn't fair! He really wanted<br/>to fight those monsters. He developed some cool new moves after<br/>China he really wanted to try. They just weren't safe to use on any<br/>human opponents. He supposed his mother was right in some things<br/>though. With the way those reporters in the park where mobbing those<br/>girls he was reluctant to show anybody his abilities. Those sailor scouts<br/>didn't seemed too bothered though. It seemed nobody know who they<br/>where anyway. They probably had the perfect disguise. This is when<br/>his thoughts stopped. The perfect disguise... he grinned.<p>Only sailor scouts fought those monsters right? They wouldn't really<br/>notice another one right?<p>He felled almost giddy. So much to plan, so much to do. An almost<br/>maniacal grin appeared on his face.<p>***<p>END PART I
