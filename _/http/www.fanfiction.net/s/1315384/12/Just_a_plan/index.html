</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>Yes finally finished a chapter again. Live always seems to get busier just<br/>as you want to write. It has been far too long for me to work on this story<br/>again. (Ducks to avoid all the rotten vegetables disgruntled readers are<br/>throwing at the author.) I hope you people will enjoy this chapter. Things<br/>are heating up again. Last few chapters were a bit slow but there were<br/>some scenes in there I wanted to try.<br/>Daniel Kim: you ask who those mysteries strangers are? Now that's ... a<br/>secret!<br/>Eugene Jacobson: the people who Akane are staying with are relatives.<br/>The characters are sprouted from my own imagination.<br/>Just some additional information about the neko ken in the last chapter.<br/>Ranma is not cured. Just less likely to go insane when near cats. The two<br/>guardian cats are a different matter though. They are not real cats.<br/>Ranma will still be uncomfortable in there presence though. Just not<br/>scared out of his wits.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XII<br/>Rumble in the park<p>The other Senshi would probably have fainted if they could see Sailor<br/>Pluto now. There was a mad grin on her face, almost feral. Because her<br/>captor had disappeared again, she had the change to rummage through<br/>her personal stuff space and see if there was anything of use in there.<br/>Most of it was junk though. She couldn't imagine why she had ever kept<br/>those tacky souvenirs from her visit to Paris. It wasn't until she stumbled<br/>upon a slightly battered book that caught her attention. She couldn't<br/>remember where or for that matter when she picked it up but there was<br/>something telling her it could be of some use. The title read;<p>- Ultimate game techniques -<p>Leaving through the pages, she raised an eyebrow when she realized it<br/>was a book full of tips and tricks to cheat during games. It covered almost<br/>every classic game invented by man. From shogi too card games. Reading<br/>a random page, she made a funny face.<p>"That couldn't possibly work." She muttered. "Nobody is that dumb."<p>She turned the book to look at the cover again noticing the name of the<br/>author. She was interrupted when her captor returned. Quickly she hid the<br/>book.<p>"I can't believe I'm going to try this." She thought to herself.<p>Putting up an excited face she pointed to something behind her captor.<p>"Look, it's Michael Jackson!"<p>"What? Where!"<p>Pluto almost face faulted when she saw her captor looking around<br/>excitedly.<p>"Ok. So maybe some people were that dumb." She thought. The thought<br/>excited her, she need to read more of the book as soon as she got the<br/>change. There were bound to be more techniques in there that could help<br/>her. "This Saotome guy was probably a genius to come up with those<br/>things if they actually work." Around the world, several people had the<br/>strange urge to face fault for no apparent reason. They decided against it<br/>though. It was a rather painful experience after all.<p>* * *<p>Ranma glared menacingly at her opponent.<p>"Don't think you can get away with it."<p>"Try me."<p>The red head launched forward tackling the blonde girl to the ground.<p>"Saotome ultimate technique! Tickle surprise!"<p>"Whahah! Stop that! Hahaha. You're still not getting it!"<p>Crunch, munch and gulp.<p>"Whaaaaa! You swallowed it! No fair!"<p>Usagi jumped up striking a pose with her hand in the V sign. "Victory!"<p>Ranma just couldn't believe it. She had lost! The last of the cookies she<br/>had baked had disappeared in the blonde girl's stomach. She narrowed<br/>her eyes. She might have lost this one but she wasn't defeated yet. If her<br/>own techniques wouldn't work, she had to make her opponent's<br/>techniques her own and use it against her. A wicked smile appeared on<br/>her face. She quickly suppressed it when she turned towards Usagi.<p>Usagi was still gloating over her victory. She noticed her friend looking at<br/>her and her eyes went wide. The red heads lip quivered and her huge blue<br/>eyes were on the verge of tears. Usagi never having experienced her own<br/>technique used against her just stared for a few seconds before her<br/>defenses crumbled.<p>"Whaaa! Don't cry Ranma! I'll make it up to you. How about I come to<br/>your place tomorrow and I will bring a plate of cookies of my own?"<p>Her friend seemed to brighten up immediately. She heard snickering<br/>coming from behind her and turned around to see the other girls and<br/>Ranma's mother standing there with amused smiles on their faces.<p>Nodoka spoke up. "Ranma. I think it's time the both of us are heading<br/>home."<p>"Ok mom. Let me just say goodbye." Ranma turned back to Usagi and<br/>gave her a quick hug. Something he probably wouldn't have done a week<br/>ago. But a person changes when you have a friend like Usagi.<p>"Thanks for inviting me Usagi. I'm sorry it didn't work out quote the way it<br/>should have though."<p>"Don't worry about it Ranma." Usagi said cheerfully. "I'll see you<br/>tomorrow."<p>Usagi and her friends waved Ranma and Nodoka goodbye when they<br/>walked down the street and headed home.<p>* * *<p>Ranma woke up when he heard voices coming from outside his room.<p>"I think Ranma is still asleep dear. Yesterday must have been more tiring<br/>than we thought. You can go to her room and wake her up if you want."<p>"Oh oh." Ranma thought. His mother didn't know he had turned back into<br/>a boy before he went to sleep last night. This was not good. Jumping out<br/>of bed, he grabbed a shirt and pulled it over his head. He stiffened when<br/>he heard the sound of his door beginning to open. Jumping up he clung to<br/>the sealing meanwhile muttering to himself. "Be one with the wood, be<br/>one with the wood."<p>Below him, Usagi entered the room. She looked around confused when<br/>she noticed nobody was there. Meanwhile Ranma silently dropped from<br/>the ceiling and landed behind Usagi. He tiptoed trough the open door and<br/>was about halfway down the hallway towards the bathroom when he<br/>heard Usagi's voice behind him.<p>"Who are you?"<p>Ranma froze for a second and slowly turned around to face the blonde<br/>girl. Usagi had exited the room and noticed the stranger in the hallway.<br/>She noticed the boy was only wearing a shirt and boxers that covered his<br/>delightful tight... She mentally smacked herself and reminded herself she<br/>had Mamoru. She turned around quickly to prevent any further<br/>embarrassment and her own fiery blush.<p>When Ranma had turned around, he noticed he was now looking at the<br/>back of his friend. He was slightly confused by that. He thought furiously<br/>how he could explain his presence.<p>"I'm eeuh. That is, my name is Ryoga. Yeah, that's it. I'm a friend of<br/>Ranma's."<p>"Ueehm." Usagi stammered a little bit herself still a little embarrassed. It<br/>wasn't easy talking to someone with your back turned to them.<p>"Nice to meet you. I'm Usagi. Do you know where I can find Ranma? Was<br/>supposed to wake her up but she is not in her room."<p>"Uhm. She is probably out for a jog or something. She should be back any<br/>minute now." Ranma said more confidently.<p>"I think I will wait in the living room then. Bye." With that, Usagi hurriedly<br/>walked away.<p>With a sigh of relief, Ranma headed to the bathroom. A quick splash later<br/>and a trip to her room for some appropriate clothing she was ready to face<br/>her friend.<p>Usagi was waiting for her in the living room as she had said.<p>"Hi Ranma." The blonde greeted her friend. "I thought we could go to the<br/>park today. There putting up a midsummer play at the podium."<p>Ranma wasn't entirely sure. She didn't have a lot of experience with plays<br/>and the one experience she did have wasn't that good. She didn't want to<br/>disappoint her friend though.<p>"Ok. Let's go."<p>"Bye mom!" Ranma called out to her mom who was currently in the<br/>kitchen.<p>The two girls walked out the front door. Usagi got a mischievous glint in<br/>her eyes just as they stepped out.<p>"Hey Ranma. I met your boyfriend this morning."<p>"Urk." Ranma responded intelligently.<p>* * *<p>"I'm telling you, he is just a friend!"<p>"Sure Ranma." Usagi responded. "I believe you." She had a playful smile<br/>on her face though.<p>"Aaaarg!" Ranma let out a frustrated growl drawing attention from several<br/>people in the crowd. Ranma and Usagi were working there way through<br/>the mass of people to get a better view of the outdoor stage.<p>"Ranma? What are you doing in Kyoto?"<p>Ranma sighed. Things just got worse. "Ryoga you dolt. Your in Juuban."<p>"I am?"<p>Usagi just looked confused by this conversation.<p>"Hi Ryoga. It's nice to see you again." She said uncertainly. Although they<br/>had technically met this morning, she didn't get a good look at Ryoga with<br/>her back turned to him. But this had to be him. His name was the same<br/>and Ranma seemed to know him.<p>"Excuse me miss. Have we met before?" Ryoga was now confused as well.<p>Ranma just sighed again and grabbed Ryoga by his shirt and began to<br/>drag him off.<p>"Come on Ryoga. We need to 'talk'. I'll be right back Usagi. Just give me a<br/>few minutes."<p>Ranma and Ryoga reached the side of the stage and went to the back<br/>were there would be no people that could hear there conversation.<br/>Meanwhile Ryoga was growing more and more confused and a little angry<br/>as well.<p>"Ok Ranma. What's the deal here? Why does that girl think she knows<br/>me?"<p>Ranma laughed, a little embarrassed. "Well, she kind of thinks you are my<br/>boyfriend."<p>"WHAT!"<p>Ranma made some shushing motions to calm Ryoga down. "Don't get<br/>worked up P-chan. I have been trying to explain you are just a friend but<br/>she won't belief me."<p>"DON'T CALL ME P-CHAN!" then the last bit of Ranma's words sank in<br/>"friend?"<p>"Sheesh Ryoga, calm down. I don't think Akane heard you yet." Ranma<br/>said sarcastically.<p>This deflated Ryoga and he looked around skittishly. He just hoped Akane<br/>would never find out about the whole P-chan affair. He turned back to<br/>Ranma still a slight scowl in his face.<p>"Then what is this all about Ranma?"<p>"It's just a misunderstanding." Ranma replied. "She caught me in my male<br/>form this morning and since she doesn't know about my curse I had to tell<br/>her something. She didn't get a good look at me though so now she thinks<br/>it was you she met this morning."<p>Ryoga was about to reply when the screams of people draw their<br/>attention. Ranma, who was almost getting used to it, knew immediately<br/>what that would mean. Ryoga just looked alarmed and looked around<br/>expecting anything.<p>Ranma had spotted an open door nearby that was leading to one of the<br/>backstage areas where the props were stored.<p>"Stay put." She told Ryoga.<p>Running inside she looked around if anyone was there. Noticing no one,<br/>she used her katchu tenshin amaguriken speed to change into her Sailor<br/>Scout uniform. She was just glad she had brought it with her. Those<br/>hidden weapon techniques were really useful sometimes. Looking around<br/>again she saw several of the costumes were stored here as well. Grabbing<br/>a few items she thought that would do the job she rushed outside.<p>Ryoga watched her approach with bulging eyes. "What are you wearing!"<p>"Don't get any ideas pig boy. I rather have you not knowing about this but<br/>people are at stake here. It's just not a good idea to get recognized in a<br/>fight here. It's not Nerima after all." The red head dumped the bundle she<br/>was wearing in Ryoga arms.<p>"Here put this on. When your done just follow the sounds of the battle."<br/>With that, Ranma grabbed her mask and put it on completing her<br/>disguise.<p>Ryoga just looked stunned for a second and looked at the bundle of<br/>clothes in his arms. "Great." He muttered. "Now I'm playing super hero."<br/>He sighed ant started putting on the clothes.<p>* * *<p>END PART XII<p>Additional authors note:<br/>Whaaaaa! It's the end of the world! Genma did actually do something<br/>right! Just don't look at me, I only write the story. I have absolutely no<br/>control what the characters do. What do you think about Ryoga<br/>appearance in this chapter? Let me know. I'm not sure if I will keep him<br/>as a regular. I wasn't planning too but you can convince me otherwise.
