</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>Being sick really sucks the creatively from you. I'm just glad I could finish<br/>this chapter. On with the review reply's. Ghost in the Machine: I wouldn't<br/>necessarily say it's impossible to fool the Mercury computer or the cats.<br/>The cats haven't actually met Ranma yet. The computer could not register<br/>Ranma because she suppresses her energy levels. Especially when she is<br/>near Rei. C. Rose: I realize Ranma is OOC in some places. I think it's just<br/>more fun that way.<br/>Last but not least. The rewritten scenes where done because I wanted to<br/>keep this story just a simple Ranma/SM cross. Some reviews might have<br/>influenced it a bit but it was mainly done because I wanted it. I'm<br/>updating the previous chapter's with the new scenes when posting this<br/>new chapter.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART IX<br/>Gathering storm clouds<p>"YOU WANT ME TO WHAT!"<p>Ranma was not happy. What made it even worse was that she knew she<br/>had already lost. The Eyes of the two blonde girls in front of her seemed<br/>to grow larger shimmering with unshed tears.<p>"Please Ranma. Won't you do it for a friend?" Usagi sniffed slightly.<p>Ranma had a gut wrenching feeling in her stomach. If there was anything<br/>she could not stand it was a girl crying. Making Usagi cry seemed even<br/>worse somehow. She sighed in defeat.<p>"Fine Usagi-chan. I'll help."<p>"Thanks Ranma-chan!" The enthusiastic blonde gave the red head a big<br/>hug. She didn't seem to notice Ranma stiffened for a moment.<p>"Minako! She said she'd help!" Usagi told the other blonde<br/>enthusiastically.<p>Usagi almost dragged Ranma from the field kitchen towards the rest of<br/>her friends. Makoto and Ami seemed to be in deep conversation with Rei<br/>that seemed to stop when the three of them approached.<p>"Hi guys." Usagi said enthusiastically. "Makoto? Could I borrow Ranma for<br/>a couple of hours?"<p>"Sure Usagi." The brown haired girl replied. "I can manage with the help I<br/>already have. You five go ahead and I will come look at the show when it<br/>starts at three."<p>"Thanks. Let's go girls. We have a lot of things to prepare before the show<br/>starts." Usagi said with determination.<p>Ranma sighed again when she was being dragged towards a large tent.<p>"Usagi? What is it exactly you want me to wear?" The red head asked.<p>"You will see Ranma." She smiled. "I think all the girls will be jealous<br/>when they see you dressed in it."<p>Ranma didn't think that was a good sign. They group of four girls and one<br/>neo girl entered the large tent and worked their way between the many<br/>racks of clothes. Ranma stopped in her tracks when she saw the dress<br/>that was hanging on a mannequin. Her eyes grew large and she<br/>involuntary took a step back.<p>* * *<p>"D4."<p>"You sunk my destroyer." an annoyed voice replied.<p>Pluto was jumping with joy. Actually she was sitting demurely on the<br/>ground with a calculated look on her face. Inside she was still jumping for<br/>joy though.<p>"Your turn." She said coolly.<p>"I know, I know. Just give me a minute." The purple light seemed to<br/>flicker with frustration for a minute. "Ha! Now I've got you. E5!"<p>A small smile crept up on Pluto's face. "You missed." Her smile grew<br/>slightly more wicked. "You know, you're awfully bad at this. Aren't you<br/>supposed to be good being a game yourself?"<p>"That's being a 'card' game. This has nothing to do with that. Next time<br/>we try poker and see who laughs then!"<p>Pluto just kept on smiling. Riling up her captor like this might present her<br/>with an opportunity to escape. And it was so much fun to do.<p>* * *<p>Ranma held her breath not wanting to make any noise. She could hear her<br/>pursuers close by. Suddenly a clothes rack was shoved aside allowing light<br/>to fall in the dark corner Ranma-chan was hiding.<p>"Here she is!" A voice called out.<p>A kicking and screaming red head was dragged out of her hiding place by<br/>three determined girls.<p>"Honestly Ranma. You're acting like a little girl." Rei huffed.<p>Meanwhile Ami was sitting on the ground working on her Mercury<br/>computer. She was scanning Ranma thoroughly and analyzing the data.<br/>On the surface Ranma seemed to be a normal girl like any other. That was<br/>what her first superficial scan indicated. She seemed rather strong<br/>although not with unusual levels for a human. What peeked her interest<br/>was the faint trace of magic energy she detected. Magic in humans wasn't<br/>that unusual. It was more common than people would believe. It was the<br/>small spike in energy and magic levels she detected while Ranma was<br/>hiding. She kept an active scan on the girl just in case it happened again.<br/>She looked at the red headed girl and an amused smile formed on her<br/>face.<p>The girl was currently stripped down to her underwear and was pouting. It<br/>made her look simply adorable.<p>"Stop pouting Ranma-chan." Minako said.<p>"I'm not pouting!" Ranma said dejectedly and continued pouting.<p>Ami giggled a little hearing that. Her three other friends were trying to put<br/>Ranma in the wedding dress but the girl just kept squirming. That stopped<br/>when Usagi pinned her with an unusual stern glare.<p>"Hold still Ranma! Any girl should feel lucky to wear such a beautiful<br/>dress. Besides you promised."<p>Ranma looked slightly guilty at that and relented. It didn't take long after<br/>that before Ranma was wearing the dress.<p>"We should really do something with her hair." Minako said. "And some<br/>make up too. Not too much though, she really doesn't need it."<p>Both Rei and Usagi agreed with her on that. Usagi grabbed a brush<br/>handing it to Rei who already started unbraiding Ranma's pig tail. Minako<br/>went looking for a make up kit. When she returned she showed the others<br/>something else she had found. It was a hair ornament made out of white<br/>flowers.<p>"I think this would look great on her if we use a white ribbon to braid her<br/>hair."<p>Rei was finished brushing Ranma's hair. She took the white ribbon and<br/>hair ornament from Minako and started braiding the white ribbon in<br/>Ranma's hair. She placed the white flower ornament at the base of the<br/>braid.<p>When Rei finished her work Usagi and Minako started on the red head's<br/>make up. Ranma felt a bit strange but complied with their wishes. It felt<br/>kind of nice being fussed about. And she almost purred when Rei was<br/>brushing her hair. She could almost forget what she was wearing.<p>"I think we are done." Usagi said satisfied. "We can give her the shoes<br/>before she goes on stage."<p>Ranma realized something. "Didn't Makoto say that the fashion show was<br/>at three? That's still one and a half hour away! Why did I get ready now?"<p>Minako giggled. "You really don't think you're the only one going on stage<br/>do you? We don't have time to get you ready if we are helping the others<br/>as well."<p>Her point was being proven when a group of chattering girls entered the<br/>tent. Ranma blushed when she realized she would be surrounded by girls<br/>wearing nothing but their underwear. Thankfully she still had the pendant<br/>stone although she hid it using the hidden weapons technique. She got<br/>even more embarrassed when all the girls complemented her on how<br/>beautiful she looked. She thanked the girls and walked to a small wooden<br/>bench to wait until she was needed. Usagi and her friends tended to the<br/>new arrivals getting them ready for the big show.<p>* * *<p>"I think you're bluffing."<p>The purple light tried to look innocent.<p>"I'll match your bet and raise you another 10,000."<p>The purple light sighed in frustration. "I fold." He said reluctantly.<p>"Ha. I knew it! Pluto said triumphantly." With greedy hands she collected<br/>her winnings.<p>The purple light just couldn't understand it. "How could she tell he was<br/>bluffing if she couldn't even see his face? He didn't even have a face! It<br/>should be impossible!"<p>Pluto just silently snickered. Watching the reflection in the time gate to<br/>look at her opponents cards was not entirely honest but it was effective.<p>* * *<p>Ranma was bored. She was hungry too. She didn't have much time to eat<br/>a lot at lunch since she was helping in the kitchen. She had asked Rei to<br/>bring her something but apparently she had forgotten. She struggled to<br/>get up gathering her dress in her hands. Moving was not easy in this<br/>thing. She had to find some food before she collapsed with hunger. Even if<br/>it meant going out in public wearing this dress. When she finally managed<br/>to get up she had to hold still for a second letting her blood catch up to<br/>her brain. Not a pleasant experience. She had to get out of this tent. It<br/>was getting to hot in here anyway. She was about to head for the exit<br/>when she heard the most unpleasant thing she could imagine.<p>"SWEETO!"<p>Startled cries from the girls filled the tent. A small blur seemed to bounce<br/>between the half dressed girls lifting skirts and groping left and right.<p>Ranma groaned. Happosai was not something she needed today. It really<br/>pissed her off that the freak would show up at the precise moment that<br/>she was wearing one of the most feminine outfits ever. She was more<br/>than enough angry when the black blur bounced in her direction.<p>POW!<p>Ranma stood with her right arm extended after a blow. An angry<br/>expression on her face. Happosai was flying out the exit followed by and<br/>angry mob of girls carrying various items to pummel the pervert. Ranma<br/>followed but more slowly. When she exited the tent she was greeted by a<br/>most unexpected sight. Apparently one of those mud monsters she fought<br/>the first night showed up. She was about to run forward when she noticed<br/>Happosai already engaging it. Realizing the old lech was more than<br/>capable of disposing of the threat she hanged back to watch the show.<br/>The old man pulled a couple of his bombs from his gi planning on blowing<br/>the monster to bits. When he threw them, the monster moved aside and<br/>the bombs hit the ground creating a big explosion. The force of the<br/>explosion threw the monster through the air and it landed right at<br/>Ranma's feet. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem for the martial<br/>artist. She would just jumped to a safe distance. She was not counting on<br/>the dress she was wearing though. It seriously hampered her movements<br/>and she landed ceremonially on her butt.<p>The monster recovered quicker than Ranma had time to stand up. It<br/>loomed over her and Ranma got big eyes when she realized she wouldn't<br/>have time enough to put up a defense. It was a surprise for her when a<br/>big muscled arm plowed down on the monster reducing it to dust. The<br/>arm was attached to what most people would call minotaur creature with<br/>wings and tentacles growing out of it's back. Ranma gulped when she<br/>recognized it as Pantyhose Taro. Not one of her most pleasant enemies.<br/>The next thing she did was the most un-Ranma like thing you could think<br/>of. Perhaps it was the sudden shock, the lack of food or the sensitivity of<br/>her female body to the heat. It could have been a combination of those<br/>factors but she fainted.<p>* * *<p>Usagi was worried for her friend. They had moved her to the medical tent<br/>in one of the more peaceful corners of the soccer field.<p>"Are you sure she is going to be alright Ami?" The distressed blonde asked<br/>her friend.<p>"Don't worry Usagi. She is going to be fine. She just fainted. I'm glad her<br/>mother decided to show up though. It is always best for the patient to<br/>wake up to a familiar face."<p>Usagi seemed a little more reassured. "I think I'll go check on Ranma<br/>again and see if her mother needs anything."<p>Ami held the blonde back for a second before she would run off. "I wanted<br/>to ask you if you had planned to invite Ranma to come to our Saturday<br/>evening get together."<p>Usagi smiled happily. "That's a good idea Ami. I'll ask her today when she<br/>feels better." With that said she ran off to the medical tent to check on her<br/>friend.<p>Ami looked after her friend and thought about Ranma. It would be a good<br/>idea if the red haired girl showed up Saturday evening. It would give Luna<br/>and Artemis the perfect chance to meet Ranma.<p>* * *<p>END PART IX<p>Additional authors note:<br/>Ha! There you have it. Ranma is rescued herself this once. I suspect you<br/>didn't see that one coming did you? Next episode: Can you say Neko?
