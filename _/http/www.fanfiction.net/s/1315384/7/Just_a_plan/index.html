</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>It seems the last chapter did pose some questions. Ranma is not<br/>recognized because of the mask and different hairstyle mentioned in<br/>chapter 2. If Superman can become a reporter just because of some<br/>simple glasses and not be recognized then Ranma could do the same.<br/>Only in reverse of course. Ranma's attacks are more efficient then the<br/>Senshi's. There is a reason for that. I should address part of it in this<br/>chapter. Sorry if I made the Inner Senshi look incompetent. I never meant<br/>to do that. The Tenchi cross is more of a joke. Don't expect too much of it.<br/>The last chapter probably featured the largest scene concerning that. On a<br/>final note, I'm still having a blast writing this story! Don't expect me to<br/>quit! Bwahahaha...<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean there not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART VII<br/>Between crossfire's<p>Ryoga was walking with a determined look on his face. It didn't mean he<br/>was less lost though. He just figured if he pretended he knew where he<br/>was going he would eventually get there. He had to plough through thick<br/>jungles, cross-desolate deserts and wander through many different towns<br/>but he was finally back in Tokyo. Now all he had to do was to find the<br/>Tendo dojo without wandering outside city limits. Perhaps that officer<br/>across the street could help him.<p>"Excuse me sir." It never hurt to be polite to a police officer. "Could you<br/>direct me to the Tendo dojo?"<p>The police officer almost seemed irritated. "What is it with you kids and<br/>this Tendo dojo! Like I told the other one before, go to Nerima. That's<br/>where all the dojos are. Not Juuban!"<p>Ryoga was about to ask what he meant by that when a familiar feeling<br/>made him look up. It only took him a full second to faint after his nose<br/>erupted with blood. "Panty shot and legs..." he muttered lying twitching<br/>on the ground. Passersby started to avoid him because he was apparently<br/>a pervert.<p>The police officer was not surprised seeing one of the Sailor Senshi leaping<br/>across the street. He had lived in Juuban for a couple of yours after all.<br/>With a shrug, he started to revive the dazed boy. He seemed to be fine<br/>after a minute. The police officer pointed him in the direction of Nerima<br/>and send him on his way. He turned back to his own business and didn't<br/>notice the boy wandering off after a dozen steps.<p>* * *<p>Ranma blinked. She could have sworn she just saw Ryoga. It could be<br/>possible. The lost boy always seemed to surface in the most unlikely of<br/>places. Putting that thought aside she continued roof hopping home.<p>She was only a few blocks away from the apartment when she<br/>remembered she promised to help cook dinner tonight. It was one of<br/>those mother daughter things her mother seemed to enjoy lately. She did<br/>like cooking though. Ten yours either forced you to learn or you would<br/>starve. And the panda couldn't cook a decent meal if his live depended on<br/>it. He was just good in eating it. There was one particular dish she wanted<br/>to try tonight. "Better pick up some of those special spices." She muttered<br/>to herself. Her mother probably wouldn't have bought those.<p>As luck would have it, there was a small convenience store on the corner<br/>of the street below her. With a quick hop, she landed in front of the<br/>entrance. She entered the small building. It wasn't really busy.<br/>Apparently, this was one of those family stores that were open 24 hours a<br/>day. Those businesses usually needed it to keep solvent.<p>The store was tightly packed with racks of foodstuff and other everyday<br/>groceries. In the back was counter with a young boy reading a manga. He<br/>didn't even look up when the door chime sounded. Probably just looking<br/>after the store for his father.<p>Ranma ducked between two racks looking for her special spices. She<br/>hoped this store would have them.<p>"Origami? No. Thyme? That's not it either." Going through the selection of<br/>spices, she tried to find the right one.<p>"Got it!" Lifting a small package from the rack she walked too the back of<br/>the store.<p>She placed the package on the counter and grabbed some chewing gum<br/>from one of those racks the place near the cash register to tempt the<br/>customers. No, not the pink stuff. Just plain white chewing gum. Shudder.<br/>She hated pink.<p>With a grin, she grabbed her wallet from her hidden weapon space. She<br/>grinned. The maneuver was getting easier every time she used it. It did<br/>have its limits though and she would probably never be able to carry as<br/>much as Mousse did.<p>She looked up when she did not seem to get any response from the boy.<br/>She blinked. The boy just seemed to stare at her completely zoned out.<br/>Blinking again Ranma tried to gain his attention. Waving her hands before<br/>his face didn't seem to help. With a shrug, she placed the money on the<br/>counter and grabbed her groceries. Leaving the shop, she still wondered<br/>why the kid had been staring like that.<p>Inside you could hear a body hitting the floor.<p>* * *<p>"Apparently she likes cooking."<p>"Why do you say that?" Usagi asked Makoto.<p>"Those spices are very specific. They're used in special dishes."<p>Usagi drooled.<p>Rei rolled her eyes. "Cant you think about any thing else but food. We<br/>have to keep to the issue at hand here."<p>The five inner Senshi were gathered at Usagi's place since her parents<br/>would be out till much later tonight. Her little brother was on summer<br/>camp and couldn't bother them either.<p>The girls had turned on the television to watch the evening news when<br/>they showed an item about what happened earlier today at the burnt<br/>down shopping complex. Apparently the news station received some<br/>exclusive new material. It was a black and white surveillance tape<br/>showing Sailor Sapphire in a convenience store buying a pack of gum and<br/>some spices. The video wasn't of that good a quality that it actually<br/>showed what items she purchased but they did get an interview with the<br/>exited son of the storeowner.<p>"I don't get it." Minako said. "First she dusted a big flame monster<br/>destroying half a street along the way, and then she goes shopping?<br/>Somehow that just doesn't make sense."<p>"It just proves she is a nice person." Usage stated confidently. She got a<br/>dreamy look in her eyes. "Perhaps she is cooking a romantic dinner for<br/>her boyfriend. I wish I could cook like that for Mamo-chan."<p>Halfway across Juuban a certain pig-tailed martial artist got a sick feeling<br/>in his stomach that seemed to pass after a second.<p>"I agree with Usagi on that." Ami agreed.<p>Three pair of eyes focused on her.<p>The shorthaired girl blushed. "I mean the nice part. Not the boyfriend. She<br/>did save us twice after all."<p>"She is really strong and looks so cool!" Usagi exclaimed.<p>"Actually she isn't." Ami countered. "I did get a lot of clear readings on her<br/>during the fight and she is power wise weaker than any one of us."<p>That got the attention of the other girls.<p>"But she single-handedly destroyed that fire monster while three of us<br/>couldn't even do it." Usagi said confused.<p>"Yeah. And destroyed a good portion of her surroundings too with that fire<br/>twister." Minako agreed with Usagi.<p>Rei frowned. Fire was after all her domain.<p>"Technically she didn't." Ami replied. "She just uses her energy with<br/>extreme efficiency and control. The twister we have seen her create<br/>actually fed off the fire creature, using its own energy against it. The<br/>monster burned itself out while trapped."<p>That bit of information gave the other Senshi something to think about.<p>* * *<p>Ranma didn't know what to think. One the one hand he was mad at<br/>himself for going shopping while still wearing the Sailor costume. One the<br/>other hand he was happy the disguise seemed to work. His own mother<br/>had watched the news and didn't recognize Ranma as Sailor Sapphire.<p>There were some additional hiccups in his plan though. Those other<br/>Senshi seemed really set on talking to him, or rather her. He frowned.<br/>There shouldn't be a problem. They fought monsters and so did he. The<br/>neighborhood was kept save. They should be happy getting some help.<br/>That dark-haired girl that showed up at the end of the fight almost<br/>seemed mad though.<p>Some of them looked outlier familiar though. Especially that Sailor Moon<br/>girl. There was something there he just couldn't lay his finger on.<p>Saying goodnight to his mother he retreated to his room. He had a small<br/>job to do first before going to sleep. There was a small tear in the green<br/>skirt of the Senshi costume and it needed to be fixed.<p>* * *<p>The next morning Ranma was up early practicing his kata's on the roof.<br/>After a 2-hour workout, he decided to follow Akane's example and take a<br/>short jog. Breakfast wouldn't be ready in half an hour anyway.<p>He entered his room by means of the window and walked too the kitchen<br/>to let his mother know he was out.<p>"Have a nice run dear. Breakfast will be ready when you get back."<p>"Thanks mom."<p>Ranma headed out the front door and decided to take the stairs for a<br/>change.<p>He was running for just a block enjoying the peaceful morning when a<br/>familiar battle cry shattered the air.<p>"RANMA PREPARE TO DIE!"<p>Ranma jumped to the side avoiding a strike from a red umbrella.<p>"Hey P-chan. Watcha doing here? Shouldn't you be at Akari's farm?"<p>"Don't call me P-chan! And I kind of wandered off." Ryoga seemed more<br/>embarrassed about that then when he would normally get lost.<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow.<p>"Ok! I panicked! Are you happy now?" The bandana clad boy seemed to<br/>get angry again.<p>"Panicked? What about?" Ranma was confused.<p>Ryoga seemed really uncomfortable now. "She wanted me to go to this<br/>big family reunion with her. She wanted everybody to meet her<br/>boyfriend." The teen blushed deep when he said that.<p>"Bwahahaha! That's it? That's a good sign isn't it?"<p>"Ranma! Don't laugh at me! I should..." he was interrupted when his<br/>stomach made a loud growling sound.<p>Ranma laughed again. "You didn't seem to have had any breakfast yet.<br/>Why don't you come with me? Mom should have enough for three."<p>"Are you sure your mother wont mind?" Ryoga hesitated. "I kind of heard<br/>she was really mad and wouldn't let anybody come visit."<p>"Naw. It's alright. Just follow me and don't get lost!"<p>It only took the two boys a few minutes to walk back to the apartment.<br/>Ranma occasionally corrected Ryoga course when he started to wander<br/>off.<p>It was a happily smiling Ranma and a slightly nervous Ryoga that entered<br/>through the front door.<p>"Hey mom. I brought Ryoga over for breakfast. I hope you don't mind."<p>Nodoka walked into the small hallway and looked sternly at the lost boy.<p>"I suppose it's alright. But I expect him to act like a proper guest. That<br/>means no fighting."<p>Ryoga gulped and nodded vigorously.<p>* * *<p>There was absolute darkness in the void. The inky blackness almost<br/>rippled when five lights sparked to life. The lights formed a circle. They<br/>seemed to communicate without words.<p>"What is your status?" The purple light asked.<p>"Main objective was interrupted by unknown factor." Both green and blue<br/>answered.<p>"As was ours." Red and white replied.<p>"Is she one of the missing three?" came the question from purple.<p>"No." This came from green. "Initial contact showed unknown factor did<br/>not meet main criteria. Threat assessment was considered low and<br/>neglected."<p>All five lights seemed to consider this for a minute. Purple brightened.<p>"Current criteria doe not seem to fit current situation. Update is required.<br/>Threat assessment adjusted. Further investigation seems prudent."<p>With that all five lights winked out leaving the void in darkness once more.<p>* * *<p>END PART VII
