</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>Ghost in the Machine: I think I'm going to do a little more reseurch for my<br/>next fic.<br/>Adyen: She has seen Sailer Saphire. We know how observent she is<br/>though (P-chan)<br/>Leeyiankun: I use Akane for comical relief in this story. I don't want to go<br/>in to a discussion about who likes or dislikes Akane. There isn't even any<br/>interaction between Ranma and Akane in this fic. (Except chapter 1). I<br/>don't think it has any relevance here.<br/>dogbertcarroll: Artemis is paranoid, Luna isn't. You can blame that on<br/>Luna helping with the neko-ken. Rei just doesn't want to admit Usagi is<br/>right.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XVI<br/>Oh my!<p>"What about over there." Akane suggested.<p>Sakura shook her head. "I don't want to take down the other posters."<p>"We just move them." Akane said. "Take down the group shot and the<br/>Sailor moon poster and put them over there." She pointed to the other<br/>wall. "Then we should have enough room to put up the new Sailor<br/>Sapphire poster."<p>Sakura nodded thoughtfully. "I think that might work. Let's try it."<p>It took both girls only a couple of minutes to remove the old posters and<br/>hang them on the other wall. They unrolled the new poster carefully. It<br/>was a really big one and would easily fill the space the other two had<br/>occupied. They attached the double-sided tape and Akane climbed on a<br/>chair to attach the poster to the wall. Sakura gave Akane directions if the<br/>poster was hanging straight or not. When they were done they both stood<br/>back with satisfied grins.<p>Akane looked at the poster and frowned a little. The poster was a drawing<br/>of Sailor Sapphire in Anime style. It was the same as with most of the<br/>other Sailor Senshi posters. Good quality photos of the real thing were<br/>hard to come by after all. Something about the picture of this latest Scout<br/>seemed to stir a memory. She just couldn't put her finger on it. Somehow,<br/>in someway it made her mallet hand twitch.<p>* * *<p>Ranma groaned. This was starting to become a bad day. Picking up a<br/>mystery guest that turned out to be Kasumi wasn't so bad. It was walking<br/>into a fight between a monster and the Sailor Senshi that bugged him.<br/>Ranma lightly grabbed Kasumi's arm and began leading her away from<br/>the scene of the fight.<p>"Oh my." Kasumi exclaimed. "I never expected to see the Sailor Senshi in<br/>real life. I wonder if I can get their autograph."<p>Ranma resisted the urge to face-fault. Kasumi just witnessed a brutal fight<br/>and all she could think about was getting their autograph? He sighed and<br/>pulled Kasumi further down the street while keeping a wary eye on the<br/>ongoing fight. The Senshi seemed to be doing alright, though. If he was<br/>lucky he wouldn't need to help.<p>The monster they were facing was one of the now common and<br/>unidentifiably human shape variety. It seemed to consist of condensed<br/>mist. Physical attacks didn't seem to phase it and, although magical<br/>attacks were evaded most of the time, the five girls were wearing it down.<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes. If there was one thing he was good at, it was<br/>tactical analyses in battle. A few things about his previous encounters with<br/>those creatures clicked into place. The creatures he and the Senshi fought<br/>seemed to adapt after every encounter. Because he had faced and<br/>finished a number of them before the senshi could, the development<br/>seemed mostly focused on him. He had to admit that the rock creature he<br/>had faced in the park would have been tough without the help Ryoga had<br/>provided. This mist creature would have probably been even harder for<br/>him to face. He relied a great deal on his hand-to-hand abilities and those<br/>would do him no good in a fight against this thing. Ki attacks would work,<br/>but with the rate this thing was going, he would probably run his reserves<br/>dry before finishing the job. No matter how good he was he didn't think he<br/>could match the raw power the senshi had at there disposal.<p>He grinned when one of Sailor Mercury's attacks hit dead center and froze<br/>the monster in place. That girl was smart. She figured out the monster's<br/>weakness and used it. Now that the monster was a stationary target, the<br/>others would be able to finish it off. He wondered if he could have used<br/>the soul of ice technique to freeze the monster. Something to think about<br/>later.<p>All five girls fired their attacks and blew the monster to dust. Ranma<br/>grinned. He didn't have to do a thing and, although he wouldn't have<br/>minded going up against the monster, there would have been no way he<br/>could have done that without blowing his cover with Kasumi here.<p>Ranma looked to his side to see if she was alright. He blinked when she<br/>wasn't there. Hadn't she been standing there a minute ago? He looked<br/>around frantically until he noticed Kasumi had somehow managed to get<br/>to the Senshi and was chatting with them while asking for their<br/>autographs. He gnashed his teeth. He would have preferred to stay away<br/>from the senshi in his normal form. From what he had seen from both<br/>Minako and Makoto's boy crazy behavior, it wasn't safe around them in<br/>anything else but his girl form. With a sigh of resignation, he approached<br/>the girls as carefully as he could.<p>"Kasumi?" He tried to get her attention. "I think we should go now. Mom<br/>is probably waiting."<p>Ranma grew increasingly uncomfortable when six pairs of eyes focused on<br/>him.<p>"Yes, you two better go. He he." Sailor Moon laughed nervously. She<br/>recognized Ranma's male form and knew Minako and Makoto's reputation.<br/>She scratched the back of her head in embarrassment while still laughing<br/>nervously.<p>"I can't agree more. He he." Ranma laughed nervously as well. He<br/>scratched the base of his pigtail in embarrassment.<p>The group blinked hard upon seeing those closely identical gestures being<br/>made between the two of them. Ranma took advantage of their<br/>momentary distraction and grabbed one of Kasumi's arms and high tailed<br/>it out of there.<p>"Oh my." Kasumi responded.<p>* * *<p>Five colored lights penetrated the inky darkness. The group just finished<br/>watching the battle between the Sailor Senshi and there latest creation.<p>"It lasted relatively well." The blue light started the conversation. The<br/>other four lights hummed in agreement.<p>"There was no sign of the unknown element though." The red light said.<p>"Perhaps we have focused our attention too much on this element." The<br/>purple light responded. "We must not lose track of our original goal."<p>"I agree." The green light said. "We can not..." The green light went quiet<br/>for a second. "I think someone's coming."<p>In a wink, all five lights disappeared.<p>After a couple of seconds, several creaks were heard. Suddenly, a stream<br/>of light flooded the dark space.<p>"There it is." Earl the janitor grabbed the broom from the closet and<br/>closed the door.<p>It was quiet for a moment and then the five lights appeared again.<p>"I thought you said nobody ever used this place!" The green light said<br/>irritably.<p>The purple light flickered in embarrassment. "Nobody hardly does." He<br/>tried to defend himself. "I was a little preoccupied lately to check. Let's<br/>just forget about it and continue with our next move."<p>* * *<p>Ranma and Kasumi arrived at the apartment in good time. His mother<br/>greeted them at the door. Soon Kasumi and Nodoka were chatting quietly.<br/>After a few minutes of pleasantries, Ranma was already bored. It was<br/>then that his mother turned to him.<p>"Ranma. Be a dear and run to the shop for me. I think we're all out of<br/>sugar."<p>Ranma sighed. "Sure thing, mom. I won't be long."<p>"There is no need to hurry, dear. Take your time."<p>Ranma just shrugged and left the apartment. The moment the door of the<br/>apartment closed, Nodoka turned towards Kasumi with a serious face.<p>"I wanted to ask you a few questions about Ranma now that he is gone<br/>for the moment."<p>"Ah yes." Kasumi responded. "You mentioned something about that on the<br/>phone. Something about a boyfriend?"<p>Nodoka nodded. "That was what I heard one of Ranma's new friends say.<br/>I'm not sure if it is entirely true, but Ranma has been spending a lot of<br/>time in girl form lately. Perhaps you could observe him while you are<br/>visiting?" The older woman sighed sadly. "I'm afraid you might know<br/>Ranma better than I do."<p>Kasumi gave her a sympathetic look. "I'm sure it's nothing serious. I do<br/>know that Ranma allows 'herself' more freedom when in girl form. Ice<br/>cream parfaits are a good example of that. You would never see male<br/>Ranma eat them, but female Ranma, on the other hand, would."<p>Nodoka looked thoughtful. "Perhaps you are right. It's probably nothing to<br/>worry about. Ranma's new friends don't know about his curse, after all."<p>Kasumi smiled. "It's nice to see Ranma make new friends. That reminds<br/>me. I met those nice senshi girls on our way here. They look so cute in<br/>those outfits." She sighed dreamily.<p>Nodoka's eyes went wide.<p>* * *<p>Ranma was walking down the street, one hand behind his head and the<br/>other holding a bag of sugar. He lazily whistled a tune. His mother said<br/>not to hurry so he could take his time. He strolled past a group of teenage<br/>boys that were hanging around at the corner of the street when he heard<br/>some of their conversation.<p>"Would you look at that." One of them said mockingly. He was holding a<br/>magazine and pointing at a picture. "She doesn't even have the bow right.<br/>Those costumes are stupid anyway."<p>"Yeah." One of the other punks said. "I bet they're not so tough. I could<br/>beat them easily." He boasted.<p>The rest of the group laughed, although some of them somewhat<br/>hesitantly.<p>The first boy, apparently the leader, shrugged and threw the magazine in<br/>a nearby trashcan. "Let's go to the arcade." He said "I'm getting bored<br/>here." The group started walking of.<p>Ranma waited until the group was gone before he took a look at the<br/>magazine that was thrown into the trashcan. His eyebrow twitched. There<br/>was a picture of Sailor Sapphire on one of the pages. It was now obvious<br/>what those boys had been talking about. This really ticked Ranma of.<br/>Those punks had the nerve to call his costume bad! He had worked hard<br/>on that. If there was one thing Ranma couldn't stand it was injured pride.<br/>And one of them even had the audacity to claim he could beat the senshi!<br/>Ranma was now mad. "Stupid punks." He growled. "I'll show them." An<br/>evil gleam appeared in his eyes. He would scare them so bad they would<br/>go running to their mommies crying. Nothing permanent, of course. They<br/>weren't martial artists after all. Just a good scare. He chuckled evilly.<br/>Looking around, he went in search of a quick splash of water. A nearby<br/>drinking fountain proved to be helpful. A quick trip into an abandoned ally<br/>and a change of clothing was the next step. A couple of seconds later<br/>Sailor Sapphire was roof hopping to the nearby arcade.<p>* * *<p>"Ohohohoho!" Pluto laughed evilly. She just couldn't contain it. Her captor<br/>wasn't present at the moment anyway. She raised her hand and looked at<br/>it. Small arches of electricity were shooting between her fingers. She<br/>could feel the power lying behind it and ready to be released. The feeling<br/>was incredible. It wasn't the power itself that generated this feeling, but<br/>the hard work that went with gathering the power. It was a feeling of<br/>accomplishment.<p>"Soon." She mumbled. "Very soon." She cackled evilly again.<p>When her captor returned she would start again. She estimated she<br/>needed roughly two days to gather the remaining energy she needed. It<br/>all depended on the amount of energy she could persuade him to use in<br/>there little games. It was always satisfying to see one of his creations<br/>withher and die, the energy added to her own reserves.<p>"Yes, my pretties. Come to me. Your energy will be mine!"<p>* * *<p>END PART XVI<p>Additional authors note:<br/>Another chapter done. I hope you all enjoyed it. Next episode of "just a<br/>plan". Has Pluto gone mad? What will Ranma, or should I say Sailor<br/>Sapphire do when she reaches the arcade? And Kasumi might not be as<br/>oblivious as we all think.
