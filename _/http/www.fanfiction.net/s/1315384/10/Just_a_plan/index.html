</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>Wahoo! Broke the 20,000 word barrier with this chapter. This means this<br/>fic belongs to the small group of 12% of all Ranma fics on  that have<br/>done that. This is an extra long chapter to celebrate.<br/>For those of you who wonder what happened to Ranma's pendant stone,<br/>she used the hidden weapons technique to hide it. What happened with<br/>Taro will come to light in this chapter. Just read it.<br/>Adyen: Running through walls? Isn't that shampoo's technique?<br/>Ghost in the machine: I thought you might like this twist on the 'rescue'<br/>angle. Grin.<br/>Mr. Confusion: I'm not sure how super or magical those girls are. Haven't<br/>seen that many episodes of sailor moon I must confess. I just know they<br/>are crummy fighters when you compare them to Ranma. Skill wise that is.<br/>Raw power they have. Knowing how to use it efficiently is another story.<br/>All other reviewers: Thanks for the kind replies.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART X<br/>Can you say Neko?<p>Ranma awoke with a groan. The first thing she saw when opening her<br/>eyes was the face of her mother. She was about to react in her usual way,<br/>that is cling to the ceiling and scream, when she realized two things. The<br/>first one was that she was inside a tent and clinging to the 'ceiling' would<br/>probably collapse the whole thing. Second was the fact that she<br/>remembered her mother knew about the curse and she wouldn't have to<br/>hide anymore.<p>"Welcome back Ranma-chan." Her mother smiled. "Would you like a glass<br/>of water? The doctor said you should drink lots of fluids."<p>"Thanks mom. I'm kind of thirsty." Ranma groaned again. She rubbed her<br/>eyes trying to clear her sight. She noticed someone had put a wet wash<br/>cloth on her forehead. Pulling the cloth off her head she tried to sit up.<br/>Her mother just returned with a glass of water.<p>"Here you go dear. Don't drink too quickly. You might get dizzy."<p>Ranma accepted the glass gratefully. Her throat felt dry. She drank about<br/>half the glass before she focused on her mother again.<p>"What happened?"<p>Her mother got a thoughtful look. "I only know what I saw. I came to visit<br/>the fair and see how you were doing when all the commotion started. It<br/>was most confusing. There was this huge monster standing over you<br/>roaring how nobody was going to get the old freak but him. I was really<br/>concerned you might be hurt. It was then that several of the Sailor Senshi<br/>showed up and started fighting the monster. I'm not sure what happened<br/>after that because I was much to concerned about you."<p>Ranma winced when her mother told her about the fight between the<br/>Senshi and Taro. She didn't know who she should feel more sorry for.<br/>Pantyhose for getting chased by angry magical girls or the Senshi for<br/>fighting Pantyhose. She wasn't really worried about the fight though. The<br/>Senshi relied too much on there magical attacks and they needed a semi<br/>stationary target for that. Tarou was much too agile for that. If the fight<br/>was getting to hot for him he could always find some hot water and turn<br/>human.<p>"What happened to the old freak mom?"<p>There was a scowl on Nodoka's face when Ranma mentioned Happosai.<br/>"There were reports of several panty raids in the area so I assume he is<br/>still on the loose."<p>Ranma was not happy with that bit of news. Where ever the old goat was<br/>trouble soon followed. She gulped down the last of her water and tried to<br/>stand up but her mother pushed her back on the field bed.<p>"Ranma dear. You should try to take it easy. You don't want to faint again<br/>now do you?"<p>Ranma's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. "Mom! I did not faint! Guys<br/>do not faint!"<p>Nodoka raised an eyebrow. "You hardly a guy at the moment are you? I<br/>like the wedding dress." She added with a smirk.<p>Ranma felt even more embarrassed. Struggling she managed to stand up<br/>and was about to pull the offending dress off when her mothers hands<br/>stopped her.<p>"Come over here Ranma-chan."<br/>Nodoka led the neo girl to a standing full length mirror. Halting the girl in<br/>front of it they both looked to their reflection. Nodoka had a serious look<br/>on her face.<p>"What do you see Ranma?" She asked gently.<p>Ranma grumbled. "I see myself stuck in a wedding dress." She replied<br/>dejectedly.<p>Her mother didn't reply to that immediately. "You know what I see<br/>Ranma? I see a beautiful girl that is refusing herself to shine like the<br/>brilliant star she could be."<p>Ranma frowned. "So you want me to be a girl?"<p>Nodoka shook her head. "No Ranma. I just want you to be yourself. I<br/>know your father tried to raise you to be a 'man amongst men'. I'm partly<br/>to blame for that. The contract was a way for me to keep your father in<br/>line although I'm slightly appalled the way he tried to comply with the<br/>contract. His version of a 'man amongst man' was never what I had in<br/>mind. I'm just glad you managed to turn out the way you did."<p>Ranma just stared at her mother while she was speaking. There was<br/>always some doubt in her mind that her mother might be disappointed in<br/>her. And now she was hearing her mother was glad she turned out the<br/>way she did!<p>There was a smile on Nodoka face and she looked deep in her child's eyes.<br/>"Don't suppress anything of yourself. This curse is just another part of<br/>you. And no matter what you look like I still love you."<p>Ranma felt tears dripping down her face. Her mother really did love her!<br/>She didn't mind the curse. There was always some doubt in her mind but<br/>her mother's words washed them away. It was the first time since she<br/>started the 10 year training trip that she felt unconditional love from a<br/>parent. With a cry she wrapped her arms around her mother burying her<br/>tear stricken face in her mother's kimono.<p>Nodoka gently wrapped her arms around the distressed girl whispering<br/>soothing words to calm her down. "Genma, Genma. What ever have you<br/>done." She thought to herself. She had expected an emotional outburst<br/>for some time now. The outburst after the failed wedding was just the tip<br/>of the iceberg. She silently cursed her cowardly husband for making<br/>Ranma such an emotional mess. She cursed herself for ever trusting him<br/>to raise their child properly. This would never have happened if Genma<br/>would have stuck to there original agreement. Whenever he and Ranma<br/>would stay long enough in one place Nodoka would come and visit. He<br/>never lived up to that promise though. Whenever she tracked down her<br/>wayward husband they would be long gone by the time she arrived. It<br/>wasn't until the Tendo's that she had a solid lead on them. She sighed.<br/>The time she and Ranma spend here in Juuban was as much a change for<br/>Ranma to get away from Nerima as it was a change for her to get to know<br/>her child again. And perhaps undo some of the damage Genma had<br/>caused<p>The sobbing red head finally seemed to calm down. Taking a deep breath<br/>she straightened up untangling herself from her mother.<p>"I'm ok now." She said with a whispering voice.<p>"Are you sure?" Here mother asked with a concerned voice.<p>The red head just nodded while drying her eyes. She seemed slightly<br/>ashamed about her show of emotion.<br/>"I think I should change now. Do you know where my regular clothes are<br/>mom?" She tugged at the wedding dress. "I think I want to get out of this.<br/>It reminds me of…" She trailed of not finishing her sentence.<p>"I know dear. The failed wedding is not one of my favorite memories<br/>either." She frowned disapprovingly. "I'm still not happy with some<br/>people's behavior."<p>Ranma giggled a little, her mood slightly lightening when she remembered<br/>the glare her mother pinned Ryoga with when he visited.<p>* * *<p>Usagi was walking besides her friend Ami towards the medical tent. A<br/>worried expression on her face.<p>"The others are still looking for the monster?"<p>"I think at least Rei is seriously looking." Ami replied. "Minako and Makoto<br/>are looking for that cute boy they encountered." She frowned<br/>disapprovingly. "I still don't understand how we could have lost that thing.<br/>It was too big to hide easily."<p>"Yeah. That was strange. It didn't even want to fight us." Usagi was<br/>actually relieved by that. That thing had looked scary. "Do you think it's<br/>connected to the other attacks?" She asked her friend.<p>Ami just frowned. "It's always possible but this incident doesn't have any<br/>similarities whit with the previous attacks."<p>Both girls approached the medical tent when they heard Nodoka's voice<br/>inside.<p>"I know dear. The failed wedding is not one of my favorite memories<br/>either. I'm still not happy with some people's behavior."<p>"Wedding?" Ami whispered to Usagi.<p>"No wonder Ranma was so reluctant to put on the wedding dress." Usagi<br/>whispered back. "I would be devastated if my wedding would be<br/>canceled." Her eyes teared up "Poor Ranma. We have to do something to<br/>cheer her up. I wonder who her fiancé is though."<p>Ami just nodded in agreement. Both girls entered the tent. When they saw<br/>Ranma they both noticed the girl had been crying. Not wanting to<br/>embarrass there friend they didn't mention it.<p>"Ranma? I brought you your clothes. I don't think we need a model for<br/>the fashion show anymore." Usagi put the bundle she was carrying on the<br/>bed.<p>"Thanks Usagi-chan." Ranma was relieved that she could ditch the dress<br/>and change. She did notice the disappointed look on Usagi's face though.<br/>"What is the matter Usagi-chan? I'm sure you can find someone else to<br/>model the wedding dress."<p>Usagi just sighed. "That's not the problem Ranma. The show was canceled<br/>because the stage was utterly destroyed in the fight. There is just no way<br/>we could repair it in time." The blonde girl sighed again looking defeated.<p>Ranma didn't like seeing her friend sad. She touched her mothers arm to<br/>get her attention and whispered something in her ear. A smile appeared<br/>on Nodoka's face when she heard what Ranma had in mind.<p>"Excuse me girls. I have some errands to run." With that Nodoka left the<br/>tent.<p>Usagi and Ami just looked confused. Ranma just smiled.<p>"Usagi, can you help me whit with some of my make up?" the red head<br/>tried to distract the blonde girl. "I think I smudged some of it."<p>The blonde girl immediately brightened. "Sure Ranma. Didn't you want to<br/>change first though?"<p>Ranma's smile broadened. "Not just yet Usagi. I think I'll wait for a while."<p>Usagi just shrugged her shoulders and went to collect some of the make<br/>up she needed to help Ranma. It didn't take long to repair the damage.<br/>While Usagi was helping Ranma she remembered that she and Ami were<br/>here to cheer Ranma up. She knew just the thing that would do it.<p>"Some of my friends and I are having a small get-together Saturday<br/>evening. Would you like to come over as well? It will be fun"<p>Ranma was slightly taken aback. She never got invited to any kind of<br/>party before. Back in Nerima people didn't invite her because they were<br/>afraid of the trouble that followed everywhere she would go.<p>"Sure! That would be great."<p>Usagi just smiled happily. Her friend would come over and they would<br/>have a great time. Ami wondered if Luna and Artemis would provide some<br/>answers when they would meet Ranma.<p>The three girls were chatting normally when Nodoka returned.<br/>"Come on girls. There are some people that would like to meet you."<p>* * *<p>Dayu Hiraoka was talking animatedly at his cell phone.<p>"I'm telling you Takuma, it's the biggest discovery of the year. If we play<br/>our cards right this could get huge. I'm sending you the photos as soon as<br/>possible and you can judge for yourself."<p>The dark haired man was holding a camera in his hand as if it was made<br/>out of pure gold.<p>* * *<p>Saturday evening seemed to approach rapidly and Ranma was actually<br/>looking forward to it. Most of the time until that evening he spent reading<br/>mangas or doing katas on the roof of the apartment building. Residents of<br/>the neighborhood spotted Sailor Sapphire on occasion as well when one of<br/>those mud monsters appeared. None of them would make the connection<br/>to the pig tailed boy that walked through the neighborhood from time to<br/>time. Not much excitement for the martial artist just some time to relax.<br/>When Saturday evening finally approached Ranma was ready to go. A<br/>splash of water and a change of clothes was enough.<p>"Here you go Ranma." Nodoka handed Ranma a covered plate whit<br/>cookies. "Have fun dear and don't be back to late."<p>"Don't worry mom." Giving her mother a quick kiss she exited the<br/>apartment. She was in a good mood and she bounced down the<br/>apartment buildings stairs giving Miss Kaneko from apartment 2E quite a<br/>fright.<p>"Sorry Miss Kaneko. I'm just in a hurry to get to my friends place." Ranma<br/>apologized.<p>The startled young woman just smiled at the red head. Such spirited<br/>children were a joy to watch even if they surprised you.<p>"That's ok dear. Have fun with your friends." She shook her head when<br/>the energetic red head run out the door with a wave. Both she and her<br/>brother had become a well known sight in the building the past week.<p>Meanwhile Ranma was running down the streets of Juuban at a leisurely<br/>speed. She wasn't in a hurry and Usagi's house wasn't that far away. It<br/>only took her a few minutes to reach her destination. Ringing the front<br/>door bell she waited for her friend to open the door. Looking around she<br/>noticed Usagi lived at a nice place. It felt like a home.<br/>When the door opened Ranma was greeted by a smiling Usagi.<p>"Hi Ranma. I'm glad you could make it. Come in and I'll show you where<br/>the others are."<p>"Thanks Usagi. I really appreciate it that you invited me. I brought some<br/>cookies. I baked them myself." She handed Usagi the plate. The blonde<br/>girl was already drooling.<p>"Cookies. I love those." She walked to the living room whit her friend in<br/>tow. When she entered she called to her friends. "Hey guys. Ranma is<br/>here and she brought cookies!" She noticed her friends weren't paying<br/>attention and were staring at something behind her. When she turned<br/>around she saw Ranma frozen in the doorway whit a terrified expression<br/>on her face.<p>"C…C… Cats!" the red head managed to stutter.<p>* * *<p>"I'm sorry miss. There won't be any prints until early next week." The<br/>saleslady apologized.<p>Akane sighed. "Come on Sakura. We will come back next week and check<br/>if they have Sapphire posters then." The younger girl looked slightly<br/>disappointed.<p>"You promise Akane?"<p>"Sure Sakura. I want one myself remember. Now let's go find a mail box.<br/>I still have a letter to post."<p>* * *<p>END PART X<p>Additional authors note:<br/>It seems I have another proof reader. This should keep the spelling and<br/>grammar errors to a minimum. Thanks NSB!<br/>Next episode: Let's party!
