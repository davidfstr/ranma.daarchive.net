</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>I have 2 pre readers! Thank you, thank you, thank you for offering your<br/>help. It will improve the story greatly. (Not to mention my grammar. lol) I<br/>plan on completing this fic so don't worry about me abandoning it. This is<br/>a grammar and spelling update as well.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean there not mine! Are you sure?<br/>Part III<br/>Complications<p>Pluto frowned. There was a disturbance in the time stream that had<br/>eluded her grasp for the last two days.<p>She was not happy.<p>Grasping her time staff, she started at the beginning once more. The<br/>original disturbance manifested itself when a new type of monster<br/>appeared in Juuban Park. Considering the fact that a new threat always<br/>seemed more powerful then the last, this monster was surprisingly easily<br/>defeated by the Inner Senshi. What was even more confusing was the lack<br/>of a pattern. With seemingly random attacks with no clear goal.<br/>If it was just a renegade monster it shouldn't have had such a widespread<br/>influence on the time stream.<p>As things stood now, the image of crystal Tokyo was in constant flux.<br/>Barely visible one minute and in total chaos the next. She sighed in<br/>frustration. Sifting through alternate possibilities, she tried to determine<br/>the origin of the thread. She gasped, when all of a sudden, the image of<br/>crystal Tokyo was strong once more. Something or someone had<br/>influenced the time stream which resulted in this shift in the pattern. It<br/>didn't last long though before it reverted back to flux. Intrigued with this<br/>new development, Pluto investigated the new split in time. Hopefully this<br/>would lead to some more answers.<p>Concentrating her magic, she tried to summon an image of the event that<br/>had just occurred. The Time Gate seemed sluggish in responding to her<br/>command. Slowly, an image began to form in the mist of time.<p>Pluto frowned.<p>It was not what she was expecting. It revealed the back of a black card<br/>decorated with golden stars. It seemed to hover in the mist and was<br/>getting bigger.<p>She blinked.<p>"Wait a minute, this is not supposed to happen!"<p>Meanwhile the card had grown to over 2 meters in size and was getting<br/>closer. Then it turned. Pluto paled when she saw the symbol on the front.<p>"Oh, no. Not them!"<p>Then the card was upon her, wrapping itself around her in a black sphere.<br/>When it was over, Pluto was imprisoned in a black shiny bubble. She<br/>prayed that whatever new force was out there would be enough to aid her<br/>queen in defeating this terrible foe. She no longer had the power to do it<br/>herself.<p>* * *<p>"Who are you?"<p>"EEP! She wants to know who I am! What do I do now! I didn't think of a<br/>name yet! Stupid, stupid, stupid. Ok Ranma, I should keep calm. Think<br/>quickly. What do I know about these girls? The scouts are named after the<br/>planets and the moon. Can't go for those. Sure ain't going to use Ranko,<br/>might as well tell mom immediately. Think stupid, think."<p>Being nervous and being Ranma, she scratched the back of her head. Her<br/>hand brushing the tiara that adorned her forehead.<p>"That's it! The tiara and the pendent stone!"<p>"Yeah, you can call me Sailor Sapphire, yeah and I fight for love and<br/>justice and all fluffy animals and cute stuff like that, he he... got to go<br/>now.<br/>Bye!"<p>With a leap, she landed on one of the nearby climbing jungle gyms and<br/>bounced towards the trees that surrounded the playground.<p>The young women Ranma had rescued stared after her disappearing<br/>savior. "That was amazing!" She thought. "I can't wait to tell my friends at<br/>work. They're never going to believe this."<p>She reached in her pocket and pulled out a small tape recorder. Pressing a<br/>button she stopped the recording. She finally had the break she hoped for.<br/>The monster attack didn't seem too bad anymore.<p>* * *<p>Ranma bounced from rooftop to rooftop feeling the wind flowing through<br/>her hair. This was what she liked about the art the most. The freedom it<br/>provided. She slowly relaxed cutting down her pace to a more normal<br/>speed. She was close to blowing her cover tonight. She was surprised to<br/>find a monster that quickly this evening. Disposing of it was even more of<br/>a disappointment. It wasn't a challenge worthy of her skills as a martial<br/>artist. No, the real problem was the girl and the question she had asked.<br/>It occurred to Ranma, that her cover was not as thoroughly prepared as<br/>she had imagined. She needed to work on her speeches as well to be able<br/>to pull off her new alter ego.<p>"Got to keep in character after all. Better write some stuff down" she<br/>mused to herself.<p>Jumping to the roof of a five-story building she halted for a moment<br/>extending her senses to scan her surroundings. Finding nothing she<br/>continued on her way.<p>"It seems there are no more monsters to dust tonight. Better head home<br/>and get some sleep. Now which way was the apartment again? If I'm not<br/>careful, I'll pull a Ryoga and end up in Yokohama. No need to get lost<br/>now."<p>It only took a few minutes to find her way back home. Silently, she<br/>slipped through the apartment window. It wasn't until she was a few steps<br/>inside until she realized she had made a mistake.<p>"ACK! This is mom's room!"<p>There was a shape of her mother under the covers of the large bed. She<br/>stirred a little mumbling a few words and eyes fluttering briefly. She<br/>mumbled, "Dearest, are you sure you have to take our son?"<p>Ranma froze.<p>After a minute of holding her breath and trying not to move she exhaled<br/>and started to sneak toward the door. Slowly gripping the doorknob she<br/>started to slowly turn it. She cringed with every little squeak it made.<br/>Finally able to open the door she took a quick and silent step outside<br/>carefully closing the door behind her. She let out a sigh of relief. Sweat<br/>was clinging to her forehead. If her mother found a Senshi in her room<br/>that was in reality her son, she would have a lot of explaining to do.<p>Tiptoeing towards her own room, she slipped inside. She quickly removed<br/>the fake Senshi uniform, stuffed it under her bed and crept under the<br/>covers. She was asleep in minutes. Keeping out of trouble was far more<br/>exhausting then fighting a monster.<p>* * *<p>"Why are you here?"<p>"I don't know..."<p>...<p>...<p>"Am I dreaming?"<p>"Yes"<p>* * *<p>Rays of the morning sun crept through the bedroom window. A few birds<br/>chirped their early morning songs. It was a perfectly peaceful morning.<br/>Underneath the covers of the bed, a certain pig-tailed martial artist began<br/>to stir. Ever so slowly the red-head emerged from beneath the covers.<br/>Dangling her feet outside the bed, she sat up. She suppressed a yawn and<br/>scratched an itch on her side.<p>It was a wonderful experience for her to wake up without being thrown<br/>out of the window first. She could really start to like that change in her<br/>morning routine. Groggily, she walked towards the bathroom.<br/>Halfway down the hallway she encountered her mother who was already<br/>fully dressed and just returning from retrieving the newspaper.<p>Nodoka gave her son turned daughter an odd look.<p>"Good morning dear. If I may ask, why are you in your girl form and<br/>wearing panties when you went to bed as a boy?"<p>This stopped Ranma dead in her tracks. Her eyes opened wide in panic<br/>suddenly a hundred percent awake.<p>She twitched nervously.<p>"I, uh. That is, I accidentally splashed myself with water while I was<br/>getting a drink? And since Usagi is coming over today and she doesn't<br/>know about my curse I thought I would get ready?"<p>Her mother raised an eyebrow and considered this answer.<p>"That's alright then dear. Now hurry up end get a bath while I finish<br/>breakfast."<p>With that said, she continued towards the kitchen leaving a relieved<br/>Ranma behind.<p>"Man, that was close. Had too many of those lately." Wearing boxers in a<br/>Sailor fuku was just not an option. Still somewhat shaken, she reached<br/>the bathroom happy to have a chance to take a relaxing bath to soothe<br/>her nerves.<p>* * *<p>Ranma made quick work of her breakfast. Usagi would be here in a few<br/>minutes to show her around Juuban.<p>She was happy about that. Spending a day with a friend without being<br/>glomped or attacked was something to look forward to. She had ditched<br/>the summer dress she was wearing yesterday and had chosen a green<br/>blouse and black slacks ensemble. No need to manipulate store owners<br/>today with her cute girly looks, so she might as well get comfortable in<br/>clothes she preferred to wear. The blouse had the added advantage that it<br/>concealed the tiara with the sapphire stone she now wore around her neck<br/>instead of the necklace.<p>Her mother was quietly reading the newspaper, so Ranma offered to clean<br/>the table and got a nod of approval from her mother. Using skills from her<br/>time working at the Cat cafe, the job was finished in no time.<p>"Watcha reading mom?"<p>Nodoka handed over the paper and pointed toward an article.<p>"Let's see... Monster attack, bla bla bla, new Senshi calling herself Sailor<br/>Sapphire, bla bla bla, impressive attack, bla bla bla, written by..."<br/>Ranma almost groaned. It must be bad karma or something. Of all the<br/>people in the city she could have rescued, it had to be an intern at a<br/>newspaper!<p>She handed the paper back to her mother.<p>"You know son, I could almost swear I had a dream about this new Senshi<br/>last night." A thoughtful look appeared in her ayes.<p>Ranma was immensely relieved when the doorbell rang announcing<br/>Usagi's arrival.<p>Ranma went to answer the door and was greeted by the bubbly blonde.<p>"Good morning Ranma. Are you ready to go?"<p>"Sure!" Ranma replied. "What did you have in mind for today?"<p>"I was planning on showing you around this morning. We are meeting<br/>some of my friends for lunch and we could go somewhere fun together."<p>"Sounds great Usagi-chan. let's go!"<p>* * *<p>Two girls where walking side by side down the street. They looked quite<br/>content.<p>"I think you're seriously addicted to ice-cream Usagi-chan. It's not even<br/>lunch time yet!"<p>Ranma might be considered a human vacuum cleaner by some people but<br/>even she had her limit when it came to sweets. The blonde just happily<br/>licked her ice-cream cone and smiled.<p>"Usagi? Do you know where the nearest post-office box is? I need to mail<br/>a letter to my fia... a friend."<p>"Sure!" She happily replied. "It should be just around the corner down this<br/>street."<p>They turned left and entered one of the more busy streets of the financial<br/>district. Ranma walked over to the post-office box and attempted to mail<br/>her letter.<br/>After a few attempts she gave the box a good kick to vent her frustration.<p>"OUCH!"<p>A head plopped out of the box.<p>"You'll pay for that Ranma!"<p>A couple of legs popped out of the bottom and Tsubasa ran off. Ranma<br/>was still standing there holding the letter in her hand too stunned to act.<p>"That was... weird."<p>Usagi fully agreed.<p>* * *<p>Ami and Rei where walking in the busy shopping district of Juuban. They<br/>where heading towards 'The<p>Press Print', one of the largest bookstores in Tokyo.<p>"And you are positive it was the same energy reading you picked up in the<br/>park?" Rei asked.<p>"Yes, I'm absolutely positive. I left the Mercury computer on passive scan<br/>all night just in case.<p>There was a 99% match between the reading from last night and the<br/>reading from the park."<p>"And you are sure it was destroyed?"<p>Ami hesitated. "It would seem the only logical conclusion. There was a<br/>strong energy spike just before the original signal totally disappeared."<p>They both went silent as they entered the store.<p>"We should discuss this at the next meeting." Ami proposed. "And I<br/>believe we should tell Usagi today as well."<p>Rei snorted. "We're supposed to meet a new friend of hers remember? I<br/>don't think there will be enough time to discuss this. Not that it would do<br/>any good anyway."<p>Ami sighed. "Very well, we will discuss this another time then. Will we<br/>meet in half an hour at the front door?"<p>Rei nodded.<p>Both girls went their separate ways. Ami headed towards the classical<br/>literature department. She wanted to add some new books to her already<br/>impressive collection. Rei went hunting for some new manga and<br/>hopefully keep it from a certain blonde girl.<p>There peaceful browsing was rudely interrupted when the screaming<br/>outside started.<p>* * *<p>"Usagi-chan? Why are all those people running down the street?"<p>"I don't know Ranma. Could it be because there is a huge mud monster<br/>heading towards us?"<p>"Yeah, that should do it."<p>* * *<p>END PART III
