</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>On to the review response.<br/>Darkwoofe: you can find some clues about Pluto's escape plan in this<br/>chapter. Don't want to spoil it of course.<br/>Tyverius: Ranma doesn't decide to live as a girl. He is just a girl a lot of<br/>the time. He uses his curse to get into the monster bashing action. He<br/>doesn't want his new friends to know about the curse either.<br/>Dogbertcarroll: yes master. I will update sooner. (author cowers in<br/>corner.)<br/>Daniel Kim: How would Ranma know about the transformation sequence?<br/>He has never seen it.<br/>Ghost in the Machine: It might be a little ooc but I made all the characters<br/>a bit toned down. And remember Ryoga has a girlfriend now. That would<br/>soften him up as well.<br/>Now that that's done with, on with the story!<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XIII<br/>Elementary my dear...<p>When Ranma, or in other words, Sailor Sapphire arrived on the scene,<br/>several shallow craters already littered the ground. She noticed one of the<br/>scouts was already attacking the huge stone monster that caused all the<br/>commotion. It was the blonde scout with the twin pigtails. Sailor Moon she<br/>believed she was called. Something about that thought seemed wrong.<br/>She just couldn't figure out what. There were other more pressing issues<br/>anyway. Like the large boulder the rock monster was throwing. The<br/>boulder that was souring through the air in her direction. The boulder that<br/>was traveling at high speed on a direct collision course with her. The<br/>boulder that...<p>"Eep!"<p>The red head franticly dodged the incoming projectile. She mentally<br/>berated herself for being distracted. Focusing her mind on the fight, she<br/>assessed her opponent. The monster was the same humanoid shape as its<br/>predecessors and as big as the fire monster she had fought at the burned<br/>down mall. It seemed to be made out of dark solid rock with a network of<br/>crystalline cracks covering its surface. She was silently thankful the<br/>creature was turning towards the other Senshi again. The eyes of those<br/>monsters were still unnerving to see, even after several encounters.<br/>Frowning she noticed the monster was now throwing rocks it seemed to<br/>pull out of thin air at the blonde Senshi, who was franticly dodging. The<br/>girl seemed to stumble and trip every so often making it hard to predict<br/>where she would be next.<p>"I wonder if she practice drunken-Fu." Ranma muttered to herself.<p>Carefully the neo Senshi circled the stone giant while it was distracted.<br/>She stealthfully called upon her Ki, preparing to attack. "I better make the<br/>first one count." She thought. "Its skin seems incredibly hard so<br/>conventional attacks probably won't work. I'd better hurry. I think it's<br/>focusing on me again." Just as the monster started to turn again, the red<br/>head unleashed her attack.<p>"Vacuum Shatter!"<p>A storm of yellow glowing small vacuum blades blasted from her hands<br/>cleaving through the air and smashing into the monster.<p>Crack! Boom!<p>The impacts of the vacuum blades kicked up a small dust cloud that<br/>enveloped the monster. To Sailor Moon it seemed as if Sailor Sapphire<br/>just fired of a storm of brightly glowing crescent Moons. Both girls' eyes<br/>bugged out when the monster seemed unfazed, it was merely knocked<br/>back a couple of feet. The craters that had been blasted from its skin<br/>reformed, repairing all the damage.<p>"What!" The red head yelled. "That should have cut through anything!"<br/>She was mad. This was one of the techniques she thought of herself based<br/>on her father's vacuum blades. And now it wasn't working!<p>"Grrrr. Let's try that again."<p>"Vacuum Shatter!"<p>Crack! Boom!<p>"Vacuum Shatter!"<p>Crack! Boom!<p>"Vacuum Shatter!"<p>Crack! Boom!<p>Ranma was left panting, feeling drained after using consecutive Ki attacks.<br/>Her anger that her initial attack hadn't seemed to of worked as expected,<br/>slightly mollified. The rock monster now had the appearance of a cratered<br/>landscape. Rock fragments littered the ground. Swaying slightly the rock<br/>giant seemed to shudder for a moment and then the damage began to<br/>repair itself once again.<p>"Aaaarrg!" Ranma was not happy. The monster seemed to have the same<br/>nasty habit of regenerating as Saffron had. She frowned. It would have<br/>been easier if she would have known the...<p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!"<p>"Ya, that's the one," She muttered. Then she blinked. She didn't say that!<br/>She watched as the right shoulder and arm of the monster just seemed to<br/>explode. Then she grinned. Ryoga had finally found his way to the<br/>battleground.<p>"Way to go Pig boy!" Ranma yelled.<p>"Don't call me that!" Came the heated replay from Ryoga.<p>"Pig boy?" The blonde Senshi asked confused.<p>"ACK!" The startled redhead replied. "Don't do that!"<p>"Do what?"<p>"Sneak up to me!"<p>The blonde just blinked and looked at the new arrival. He seemed to be<br/>wearing one of the most unusual costumes she had ever seen. His pants<br/>and shirt seemed to consist of a patchwork of any imaginable color<br/>possible. It just hurt to look at it. A bright yellow cape hung from his<br/>broad shoulders. And he was holding a red bamboo umbrella. A red mask<br/>hid the upper half of his face and he was wearing a red and yellow jesters<br/>cap with three bells on top.<p>"Let's just concentrate on the monster." Ranma sighed in frustration. "It's<br/>regenerating again."<p>The rock monster seemed to take longer to recover from Ryoga's attack<br/>but it was still able to reform its missing limb. When it was done it brought<br/>both arms forward and let loose with a storm of small pebbles aimed at<br/>the three warriors. Ranma used the Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken to deflect<br/>most of the incoming projectiles but a few got past her defense. It was<br/>rather painful to get hit by a small projectile traveling at high speed.<br/>Sailor Moon started dodging again but she wasn't nearly fast enough to<br/>avoid the painful attack. Ryoga was best of with his Bakusai Tenketsu<br/>training and didn't suffer as much damage as Ranma and Sailor Moon. The<br/>three warriors regrouped eyeing the monster worriedly. Ryoga glanced<br/>sideways towards Ranma.<p>"The Bakusai Tenketsu isn't going to do any good if it keeps regenerating<br/>you know."<p>Ranma frowned. "It was too much to hope for I guess."<p>"Can't you freeze the thing like you did with Saffron?" Ryoga asked.<p>Ranma grimaced when she was reminded about that particular event. She<br/>had killed Saffron with that move. Even if he was reborn right after, she<br/>hadn't known that when she used it.<p>"Saffron was a Phoenix, remember. He generated heat, which I used<br/>against him. This thing isn't generating anything."<p>"Oh."<p>Meanwhile Sailor Moon was listening curiously to the conversation. She<br/>tried to commit everything to memory and ask Ami if she could find<br/>anything concerning this Saffron person. Turning towards her two<br/>companions she winced slightly when she felt the many bruises the<br/>monsters last attack had left.<p>"I might be able to use my attack against the monster but I need it<br/>distracted for a moment and relatively stationary." She directed this to<br/>Sailor Sapphire who she considered one of the team for the moment. She<br/>hoped this would work or else the other scouts might not arrive in time to<br/>save them.<p>"Come on P-chan let's dance with this monster. That is if you're fast<br/>enough." The red head said with a cocky smirk.<p>"I'm plenty fast enough! And don't call me P-chan!"<p>"Whatever."<p>Both disguised martial artists shot forward and began to circle the stone<br/>giant. Ranma's girl form had more speed than his male form and she took<br/>full advantage of it. She attacked with quickly with her feet and fists,<br/>retreating out of the monsters reach when it retaliated with powerful<br/>swings of its arms. Meanwhile Ryoga lashed out with powerful swings of<br/>his own with his heavy umbrella. He used the Bakusai Tenketsu whenever<br/>he could. This kept the monster off balance and forced it to regenerate<br/>large parts of his body.<p>With the monster distracted, Sailor Moon grabbed her scepter and<br/>prepared her attack. "I'm ready Usagi called!"<p>The monster suddenly found his two attackers retreating and turned<br/>towards the new threat.<p>"Moon Gorgeous Meditation!"<p>The stone monster didn't have time to dodge the incoming attack and was<br/>hit dead center. It shuddered for a moment then an inner light seemed to<br/>shine between the cracks of its skin before it forcefully blew apart. Pieces<br/>of stone violently scattered throughout the area forcing the three heroes<br/>to duck for cover.<p>"Did it work?" Sailor Moon asked from behind a park bench.<p>"I think so." She got the reply from Sailor Sapphire who had taken cover<br/>behind a second park bench not far from her.<p>Sailor Moon looked around the area. It was a total wreck. The open<br/>theater was more then half destroyed and several craters littered the<br/>ground. She sighed. Another beautiful piece of the park destroyed<br/>because of a monster attack. She blinked when she noticed She and Sailor<br/>Sapphire were the only ones there.<p>"Where is Pig boy?" she asked.<p>Ranma suppressed her laughter when she heard Sailor Moon refer to<br/>Ryoga as 'Pig boy'.<p>"Don't worry. He's right over th... hey! Were did he go? Don't tell me he<br/>got lost again?" The red head groaned out loud. Sometimes Ryoga was<br/>really hopeless.<p>It was at this scene that the other Senshi finally arrived surprising Ranma<br/>who soon found herself surrounded by them.<p>Gulp<p>* * *<p>Pluto frowned in concentration while reading. A small chuckle escaped<br/>from her now a then. For people that knew the Senshi of time this would<br/>have been unnerving. They would have never expected such a slip of<br/>emotion as laughter. Turning another page, she continued reading. A<br/>thoughtful expression crossed her face. She grabbed a peace of paper and<br/>a pencil from stuff space and started making some notes. The ideas in the<br/>book where diverse she had to admit. Although she didn't understand the<br/>reverences to a panda. Most of the techniques that were mentioned relied<br/>on distraction and the exploitation of an opponent's weaknesses. After<br/>spending so much time with her keeper playing games, she knew the one<br/>big weakness she could exploit. He couldn't stand to lose. Pluto smirked.<br/>His inability to admit defeat would be his undoing. A plan began to firm in<br/>her mind. If everything worked out, she would be free soon enough. And<br/>then those pests would be dealt with. Stuffing the book and notes back<br/>into stuff space she awaited her captor.<p>"Pluto! Today you shall know defeat!"<p>Pluto just rolled her eyes. "What game did you want to play today?" She<br/>asked in a neutral tone.<p>"Prepare to duel!"<p>"Stop with the corny Yu-Gi-Oh speech and get on with it." She said. "I<br/>doubt this will get interesting though."<p>"What do you mean?" Asked her captor confused.<p>A glint appeared in Pluto's eyes. "I mean this is hardly entertaining. Not<br/>very life like don't you think?"<p>"Life like?"<p>"Yes. Life like. Why don't you use some of that energy of yours to create<br/>some life like representations of those cards? That would be more fun<br/>don't you think?"<p>"I don't know." The reluctant answer came.<p>"Or are you scared of losing?" Pluto asked with a smirk. She noticed her<br/>opponent's reaction immediately.<p>"Your on!"<p>* * *<p>"Are you sure you're ready to practice this ancient technique student?"<p>"Yes Sensei"<p>"Than show me what you have learned student."<p>"Yes Sensei. I'm ready."<p>"Proceed."<p>The small girl mentally prepared and got into her ready stance. She took a<br/>deep breath.<p>"Hiro no baka!"<p>WHAM!<p>Akane clapped her hands. "Nicely done student. You have accomplished<br/>your task admirably."<p>Sakura blushed with pride. "Thank you Akane Sensei. It was a great honor<br/>to study under you." Both girls shared a laugh together. Meanwhile a<br/>certain brother felt a chill go through his spine.<p>* * *<p>Nodoka was worried. Ranma had gone out with her friend to the park and<br/>wouldn't be back for a while. It was what the girl had said when they<br/>exited the apartment that worried her. If she understood correctly, Ranma<br/>had a boyfriend. While she thought that Ranma could learn many things<br/>from his female side, a boyfriend was never something she would have<br/>approved of. Perhaps there were mental processes going on in her<br/>son/daughter's head she had no grasp of. They should have a serious talk<br/>when Ranma came back. She sighed. 10 years of not being a mother<br/>finally caught up with her. Perhaps she should call Kasumi and ask for<br/>some advice. The girl was sensible and knew Ranma well. There were also<br/>those physiological and medical books she used to borrow from her doctor<br/>friend. With resolution, she graphed the phone and dialed the number.<p>* * *<p>END PART XIII<p>Additional authors note:<br/>You might have noticed I kept Ryoga in a guest appearance role. Don't<br/>worry. You will see him again. Especially when he reads the newspaper<br/>about the fight in the park. Grin.
