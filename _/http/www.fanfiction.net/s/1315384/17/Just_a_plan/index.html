</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>I'm free! More or less, that is. It looks like I'm having a little more time in<br/>the future to write. Real life can be demanding sometimes, but it looks like<br/>things are shaping up. Anyway, Let's get on with the review response.<br/>Ghost in the Machine: You got it. Things are bad when Pluto is doing the<br/>Kodachi act.<br/>Materia-Blade: Just read this chapter. ;-) Let's just say that if Ranma can<br/>get away with the amount of property damage in Nerima, then scaring<br/>some boy's can't be a major crime. Good job with your own story's as<br/>well. Keep up the good work.<br/>C. Rose: I know. I know. My chapters are short. Can't be helped, though.<br/>I blame it all on real live. It should change in the near future, though.<br/>For the rest of the reviewers: THANKS! They were nice reviews and I feel<br/>all fuzzy and happy inside.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XVII<br/>Prelude to disaster<p>Ranma-chan, or Sailor Sapphire as she was now known, was watching the<br/>arcade. A group of boys had just entered. The rooftop she occupied gave<br/>her an excellent observation point. Now that she had spotted her pray,<br/>she made her move. With a few jumps she was across the street and on<br/>top of the arcade roof. A conveniently-placed skylight provided access to<br/>the building. At least it should have. The skylight was locked tight from<br/>the inside with a latch. She wouldn't be able to open it without brute<br/>force.<p>She frowned. No stupid skylight was going to beat her. "In the movies it<br/>always works." she muttered. Reaching into stuff space, she rummaged<br/>around and retrieved a credit card. Ranma-chan blinked. How did she get<br/>a credit card with the name Setsuna Meiou on it? She shrugged. If it<br/>worked, it worked. She would bother with the details later.<p>Wedging the credit card between a crack, she managed to spring the<br/>latch. With a satisfied grin, she opened the skylight and jumped inside.<p>Ranma-chan found herself on the third floor of the building. By the looks<br/>of it, it was used mainly for storage and other general usage. The second<br/>floor should have the snack area of the arcade while the ground floor<br/>housed all the games.<p>Looking around carefully, Sailor Sapphire looked for the stairs. It didn't<br/>take long to find them. Using her sneaking abilities, she silently made her<br/>way down the dark stairs. She was about halfway down them when she<br/>heard the sound of somebody coming up. With a leap she clung to the<br/>ceiling.<p>"I am the ceiling. I will become the ceiling." She whispered to herself.<p>She saw one of the staff members of the arcade pass under her. When he<br/>had entered one of the storage chambers, she dropped down silently and<br/>made her way down the stairs as quickly as possible before he returned.<br/>Ranma-chan peeked around the thick curtain that was at the end of the<br/>stairs. She appeared to be behind the bar. A quick scan of the floor<br/>revealed a single couple at one of the tables sharing a sundae.<br/>Apparently, this was not the peak hour of the establishment. It was still<br/>early anyway. Keeping low, Ranma-chan sneaked from behind the bar and<br/>made use of tables, chairs and potted plants as she made her way to the<br/>stairs leading to the ground floor. The couple sharing the ice didn't notice<br/>her.<p>Carefully, Sailor Sapphire peeked downstairs. Noticing the flight of stair<br/>would lead her to the back of the gaming area, she made her way down.<br/>Once downstairs, she slipped between two large game machines and took<br/>to the shadows. She was lucky this area wasn't busy, as well. Looking<br/>around the area from her new observation point, she spotted her prey<br/>quickly. The group of boys she had followed were all gathered around a<br/>couple of games not far from her current position.<p>"ULTRA KILL!"<p>Ranma-chan almost jumped her skin when the sudden voice blasted in her<br/>ear. Perhaps her current position wasn't as well chosen as she initially<br/>thought.<p>"UNSTOPPABLE!"<p>ranma-chan just shook her head. She never was into computer games,<br/>and couldn't quite understand what people found so interesting about<br/>them. Blowing up a mountain in a fight with a phoenix god might make<br/>anybody a little blasé when compared to computer games.<p>"YOU HAVE LOST THE MATCH!"<p>Ignoring the continued battle cries from the machine, Ranma-chan<br/>sneaked around the room until she managed to hide between a couple of<br/>game machines behind the group of boys. She listened in on their<br/>conversation.<p>"Hey, Taki. Why are you playing that Sailor V game anyway? I thought<br/>you said they were dumb." One of the guys said. Taki, who was<br/>apparently the leader of the group, was sitting behind one of the game<br/>machines playing the Sailor V game.<p>He shrugged. "Who cares." he replied. "I've had it with this game. Let's go<br/>do something else."<p>Sailor Sapphire took this as her cue. She emerged from the shadows and<br/>stood behind the group of boys. Flaring her battle aura slightly for<br/>dramatic affect, she spoke with an icy voice.<p>"Going somewhere, boys?"<p>Those few words drew the immediate attention from the group. They<br/>turned around and stared with wide eyes at a glowing Sailor Senshi.<br/>Ranma-chan smirked when she saw the shocked expressions on there<br/>faces. She could safely assume that this was the first time these boys had<br/>actually encountered something out of the ordinary without being filtered<br/>by the media. Her smirk grew larger.<p>"I have heard how you have been a bad bunch of boys and badmouthing<br/>the Senshi. I think I might have to reeducate you." With those words, she<br/>poured some Ki in her hands, forming it into a glowing ball.<p>The eyes of the boys grew even larger and they took a step back<br/>simultaneously. Ranma-chan just glared at them darkly. Something<br/>suddenly clicked in the mind of those boys. There was a Senshi standing<br/>in front of them. A real, living pissed off Senshi holding a glowing ball of<br/>energy. A Senshi they had made fun of not too long ago. This was not<br/>good. Hurriedly, the group of boys ran to the exit of the arcade, stumbling<br/>over each other in there rush to get out.<p>Ranma-chan just watched them go. When the last one had exited the<br/>establishment, she couldn't hold it in any more. She fell over and started<br/>rolling on the ground with laughter. This, of course, attracted the few<br/>other customers of the establishment. Ranma-chan's laughter died down<br/>quickly to an occasional chuckled when she noticed she became the center<br/>of attention again. Standing up quickly, she brushed of her uniform and<br/>flashed a smile towards the people that were looking at her with wide<br/>eyes. Moving quickly, she moved to the exit and took to the rooftops. She<br/>still had a big smile on her face.<p>* * *<p>Usagi was happily walking along the street while soaking up the sun. She<br/>thought back to the monster she and her friends had fought earlier. It was<br/>a tough fight, but they prevailed. She was just happy they managed to<br/>defeat it without Ranma's help. She wondered about the girl, though. The<br/>one that was apparently an acquaintance of Ranma. She smiled. She<br/>would go see Ranma and ask about her. Perhaps she could make a new<br/>friend as well. Happily, she turned down a street on her way to the<br/>apartment building Ranma was staying at.<p>She blinked in confusion when she turned the corner of the street. There<br/>was a group of boys there that seemed out of breath from a lot of<br/>running. She ought to know the signs. She did a lot of running herself<br/>while trying to make it in time for class. The group didn't seem to notice<br/>her.<p>"I'm never going to listen to you again, Taki." One of the boys said. "What<br/>if one of those others had been there as well? That mars chick or the one<br/>with the meatballs! She is supposed to be their leader, you know!"<p>Usagi, overhearing this, stopped in her tracks. The name 'meatball head'<br/>was a touchy subject with her.<p>"Don't call me meatball head!" She almost automatically yelled.<p>One of the boys that was still jumpy from their earlier encounter yelped,<br/>surprised from the sudden shout. "It's another one! Run for it." He yelled,<br/>panicking.<p>Usagi blinked in surprise when the group of boys made a break for it,<br/>leaving nothing but dust in their trail. She shook her head. That she would<br/>never understand. They hadn't even looked at her.<p>"Hey, Usagi!" a sudden voice yelled from behind her.<p>"Eeeek!" Usagi jumped and whirled around, panting from the sudden<br/>fright. "Don't scare me like that!" she yelled.<p>She noticed an embarrassed Ranma-chan now standing in front of her.<p>"Sorry." The red head said. "I didn't mean to startle you."<p>Usagi waved it of. "Don't worry, Ranma. I should be used to it by now."<br/>She was a little embarrassed herself. "Setsuna does it to me all the time<br/>anyway." she added almost as an afterthought.<p>Ranma-chan jerked her head when Usagi mentioned that name.<br/>"Setsuna? As in Setsuna Meiou?" She asked.<p>Usagi nodded, surprised. "You know her?"<p>Ranma-chan shrugged her shoulders. "Not really." The redhead<br/>rummaged in her pocket and pulled out what looked like a credit card.<br/>"It's just that I found this. Not sure how I got it, though." She handed the<br/>card over to Usagi.<p>The blonde girl looked at it. "It's her name alright. I could return it to her<br/>when I see her again."<p>Ranma-chan nodded. "That's fine by me. Saves me the trouble." Ranma-<br/>chan looked curious at her friend. "What are you doing all the way out<br/>here anyway?' She asked.<p>Usagi smiled. "I was going to visit you. I wanted to meat that nice girl<br/>who accompanied you this morning."<p>Ranma-chan blinked. "You mean, Kasumi? Sure. She's with my mom right<br/>now."<p>The two girls began walking towards the apartment building while chatting<br/>about various subjects. Usagi mostly wanted to know how Ranma knew<br/>Kasumi. Ranma-chan related some stories about the Tendo's and the<br/>hectic life she had led in Nerima. They reached the apartment in short<br/>order. Opening the apartment door, Ranma-chan called out to announce<br/>her arrival. Both her mother and Kasumi responded.<p>Ranma-chan put the sugar she had bought in the kitchen. Both girls<br/>joined Kasumi and Ranma's mother for a cup of tea. Usagi was soon<br/>talking pleasantly with Kasumi. Ranma-chan just listened in, commenting<br/>now and again. She never noticed the covert glance and contemplating<br/>look from Kasumi.<p>* * *<p>Ranma was laying on his bed and staring at the ceiling. A smile of<br/>contentment was on his face. Today had been a good day. Kasumi's visit<br/>was a welcome surprise. It was good to know how everything was going<br/>back in Nerima. Usagi and Ranma-chan had both brought Kasumi back to<br/>the train station at the end of the day. After Kasumi had departed, the<br/>two girls had stopped for ice cream at one of the local ice cream parlors.<br/>The blonde and the redhead had promptly started an ice cream contest.<br/>This ended in Ranma-chan teaching Usagi the ultimate 'cute-as-a-million-<br/>puppies' look that so often awarded her free food. The boy behind the<br/>counter hadn't known what hit him when two extremely cute girls had put<br/>their skills to use. With an extra, free ice cream in hand, they had left the<br/>ice cream parlor, after witch Usagi said her good-bye and headed home.<p>Ranma sighed blissfully. Yes. This had definitely been a good day. Perhaps<br/>he should introduce Usagi to Akane when he was back in Nerima. He<br/>frowned. He hoped Akane wouldn't assume Usagi was another fiancée.<br/>Naaah. The blonde girl was just too nice and totally crazy about that<br/>Mamo-chan boyfriend of hers too. Yes. He should definitely introduce the<br/>two girls. With his mind made up, he closed his eyes and promptly fell to<br/>sleep.<p>* * *<p>Ami looked up from the book she was reading. The Mercury computer on<br/>her desk had made a beeping noise, indicating configuring that the<br/>parameters had finished calculating. Ami picked up the computer and<br/>started typing and checking the results of her program. She nodded in<br/>satisfaction. Typing a few commands, she put the computer back to work.<br/>It would soon be time to notify the others.<p>* * *<p>END PART XVII<p>Additional authors note:<br/>Next time we will see what Pluto is planning.
