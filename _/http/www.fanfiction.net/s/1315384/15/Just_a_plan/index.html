</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>Another chapter you might enjoy. Even if my chapters are always the<br/>same size and a bit short that doesn't mean I cant update more :-D.<br/>Chapter 16 is currently in the making.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XV<br/>A guest<p>Minako and Makoto where chatting about one of there favorite subjects,<br/>namely cute boys. Rei was crumbling a cookie in her hand in frustration.<br/>Ami was working on something on the Mercury computer and seemed to<br/>ignore the world around her.<p>"Aaarg! What's taking them so long?" Rei exclaimed irritably.<p>"Don't worry Rei." Makoto tried to calm the flammable girl down. "I'm sure<br/>what Usagi and Ranma are discussing is important. If Ranma-chan doesn't<br/>feel comfortable discussing it with us then we should respect their<br/>wishes."<p>Rei grumbled. "I just don't trust her. She could still be an enemy, you<br/>know."<p>"That seems highly unlikely." Ami interrupted. "There is no evidence of<br/>that and Usagi seems to trust her. That is good enough for me."<br/>Meanwhile, she entered a couple of commands in her computer. "Anyway,<br/>that is not important right now. What is important is this." The shorthaired<br/>girl pulled what looked like a rock fragment from her pocket.<p>"What's that?" Minako asked.<p>A serious expression appeared on Ami's face. "It's a fragment from the<br/>monster that attacked in the park today."<p>This answer caught all of their attention. Even Rei stopped her grumbling<br/>in favor of this new information.<p>"Doesn't the monster usually crumble into dust? How come you could take<br/>a fragment?" Minako was genuinely confused about this.<p>Ami had expected this question. "Usually they do. This monster was a<br/>little different though. It's molecular density and cohesion was several<br/>times higher. The decay time was quadrupled and in case of this fragment<br/>entirely nullified." Ami looked at her friends who were staring at her with<br/>glazed eyes. She sighed.<p>"The thing was incredibly hard and because of that it didn't turn too dust."<p>Comprehension dawned with the other girl.<p>"What can you do with it though?" Rei inquired.<p>"Let's just wait until Usagi and Ranma return." Ami answered.<p>* * *<p>Ranma was confused. Usually when he revealed his curse there was some<br/>kind of extreme reaction. Usagi just puzzled him. She didn't seem overly<br/>shocked or surprised. It was like she had seen such things before. Now<br/>that he thought about it, being a magical girl and all, she probably had.<br/>He was still confused what she meant by being a starlight though.<p>"What's a starlight?" He asked.<p>Usagi waved dismissively, a slight bush on her face. "They were this band<br/>of three singers that could transform into scouts too."<p>"They went to Jusenkyo too?" Ranma asked confused.<p>"I don't know anything about this Jusenkyo. I just know a thing like this<br/>shouldn't stand in the way of friendship." She said with a bright glow on<br/>her face.<p>Ranma smiled. "Thanks Usagi. But could we still keep this a secret<br/>though? It would save me a lot of embarrassment."<p>"Sure thing Ranma. In fact I think..."<p>She was interrupted when the two of them heart a crash from outside the<br/>window. Ranma quickly splashed himself with some cold water and<br/>dressed herself. Carefully the two of them approached the window. They<br/>could hear a faint conversation going on outside.<p>"What did you do that for Luna! Now I couldn't hear what they were<br/>talking about."<p>"You should be ashamed of yourself Artemis." The second voice scolded<br/>the first. "Let the two of them have their privacy."<p>"It was just some harmless curiosity." The first voice protested.<p>"Haven't you ever heard the saying curiosity killed the cat?" Usagi said<br/>loudly while opening the window.<p>The two moon cats jumped in surprise and Artemis grinned sheepishly.<p>"Let's get back to the others." Ranma said while keeping a cautious eye on<br/>the two cats. "I think we're done here."<p>The two cats jumped through the window and followed the two girls. The<br/>four of them just caught the last part of Ami's explanation when they<br/>entered the living room.<p>"What's that about a monster shard Ami?" Usagi asked.<p>Ami showed them the shard she picked up from the park. "I've been<br/>working on a conversion program that might identify it's energy matrix. If<br/>it works as I expect it to, I'll be able to pinpoint where these enemies<br/>come from."<p>"That's great!" Usagi said. "When will it be finished?"<p>"46 hours and 15 minutes." Ami answered after checking the mercury<br/>computer.<p>"That long?" Minako was disappointed. "What can we do in the<br/>meantime?"<p>Ami shrugged. "There is not much we can do except keep our eyes open<br/>for more attacks until the program is complete."<p>"Good." Rei said. "That gives us plenty of time to deal with Ranma here."<br/>She directed a glare at the red head.<p>"Would you stop that Rei!" Usagi defended her friend. "She knows who we<br/>are now anyway."<p>"Perhaps I should go home." Ranma-chan interrupted them.<p>"I walk with you." Usagi offered. "There is nothing more we can do here<br/>anyway. Perhaps we can get some ice-cream while we're underway." She<br/>said with a gleam in her eyes. Ranma-chan just groaned. It seemed that<br/>her friend had a serious ice cream addiction.<p>* * *<p>Ranma dropped on his bed. Placing his hands behind head he stared at<br/>the ceiling. Today had been a tiring day. He didn't know if he could handle<br/>more secrets exposed. With the rate, he was going Akane had probably<br/>figured out about her precious P-chan by now. He shuddered. That could<br/>get ugly. It was a good thing Ryoga had Akari now. That was one of the<br/>reasons he helped those two get together. His thoughts were interrupted<br/>with someone knocking on his door.<p>"Come in." He answered.<p>His mother entered the room. "Ranma. We will be receiving a guest<br/>tomorrow."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "A guest?"<p>His mother nodded. "So I want you to pick her up at the train station<br/>tomorrow morning."<p>"Ok mom." He looked uncertainly though. If his mother had invited a<br/>female guest that could mean trouble.<p>* * *<p>Akane just returned from her morning jog when she was greeted by an<br/>excited Sakura. The younger girl bounced up and down in anticipation.<p>"Are we going shopping today Akane?" the girl asked.<p>Akane smiled. "Let me clean up first. Then we can go out."<p>After a quick bath and some fresh clothes Akane was ready. She let her<br/>aunt know they were going out. The two of them walked too the nearest<br/>bus station and took the bus to town. It didn't take long before they had<br/>to get off. It was only a two minute walk from there until they reached the<br/>shopping district. The crowd of people in the streets steadily increased.<br/>When the two girls got near the shop they wanted to visit they noticed<br/>there were many people already there. The crowd consisted mostly of<br/>teenagers. There were a lot of boys and girls chatting in groups. Akane<br/>frowned at the first. "Perverts." She mumbled. She guessed those boys<br/>were more driven by hormones then anything else. Why else would they<br/>come to the most extensive store of Sailor Senshi merchandise in the<br/>area.<p>"Do you think I can still get a Sailor Sapphire poster?" Sakura asked<br/>worriedly. "There are a lot of people already here. Perhaps we should have<br/>come earlier."<p>"Don't worry Sakura-chan." Akane smiled reassuringly. "We'll get you a<br/>poster. Let's go see if we can get inside."<p>The two of them made there way through the crowd of people in front of<br/>the shop. They overheard various groups talking about there recently<br/>bought Senshi merchandise.<p>"Can you believe they produced this stuff so fast?"<p>"She has such pretty hair."<p>"What are her measurements?"<p>Akane growled at that one. The two of the finally made it to the door and<br/>entered the shop. There was a buzzing noise inside from all the people<br/>talking and checking out the latest Sapphire merchandise. Akane looked<br/>around looking for a poster for Sakura. She spotted a large box with only<br/>three more inside of it. These things went fast! She thought. When the<br/>two girls made there way over two posters were grabbed by a pair of<br/>excited twins. The two identical brown haired girls squealed in delight and<br/>ran off.<p>Akane and Sakura went faster to get the last one. Akane reached out and<br/>grabbed it just when another hand grabbed the poster as well. Akane<br/>looked to her side and noticed a tall boy with blonde hair that was perhaps<br/>a year older then her. Her eyes narrowed. The boy somehow screamed<br/>vanity. He was handsome and he knew it and presumed every girl would<br/>fall right into his arms. She immediately placed him in the same category<br/>as Kuno. The blonde boy who had grabbed the poster had noticed there<br/>was a cute girl besides him and showed one of his handsome smiles. It<br/>had never failed him yet.<p>"Hello there beautiful. It seems we have set our sight on the same goal.<br/>Perhaps we could discuss this over some tea?" His hand automatically<br/>reached out to take Akane's hand and kiss it. Meanwhile Akane went in<br/>full pervert bash mode. Her senses were screaming that the boy in front<br/>of her bas going to do something she would not like. When his hand<br/>reached for hers she went into immediate action.<p>"Pervert!"<p>Wham! Crash!<p>Akane turned around with a huff leaving the twitching form of the local<br/>Casanova half imbedded in the ground.<p>"Let's go Sakura. We still have to pay for your poster." Akane said while<br/>walking towards the cash register. She ignored the people that were<br/>staring at her.<p>* * *<p>Ranma sighed. He was walking the streets of Juuban on his way to the<br/>train station. The morning sun was shining brightly but it could not lift<br/>Ranma's mood. His mother had asked him to pick up their female guest<br/>that should be arriving soon. He just knew it was trouble. He didn't even<br/>know who it was. When he had asked how he would know who to meet his<br/>mother had just smiled and said "you'll see dear."<p>He reached the station with plenty of time to spare. With nothing else to<br/>do he just watched the people enter and exit the train station. Looking at<br/>the station clock he noticed the train with the mysterious guest should<br/>have arrived by now. He didn't notice anybody who would look familiar<br/>though. He was quite startled when he heard a voice coming from behind<br/>him.<p>"Hello, Ranma-kun:."<p>Ranma whirled around with wide eyes when he recognized the voice.<p>"Kasumi?" he was greeted by the brightly smiling older Tendo daughter.<br/>Ranma grinned. "It's good to see you Kasumi." He said while giving her a<br/>quick hug. "How is everybody doing back home?"<p>"We're doing well Ranma. Nabiki is looking for an apartment to live when<br/>she goes too college. Our fathers seem too enjoy themselves. I believe<br/>mister Saotome is even writing a book, although I'm not sure what it is<br/>about." Ranma was somewhat surprised at that. "I belief you know Akane<br/>is staying with her aunt for the summer." Kasumi continued. "Did you<br/>write her a letter?" She inquired sweetly.<p>Ranma blushed and looked away. "Yeah. I wrote her." He said. He<br/>deciding another subject of conversation was needed. "Mom is expecting<br/>us. I think it's best if we go now."<p>The two of them started walking chatting about various things. Kasumi<br/>updated him on the latest events in Nerima although there wasn't much<br/>exciting news since he left. They stopped their conversation when Kasumi<br/>noticed a disturbance up ahead. Ranma recognized the sound<br/>immediately. He groaned inwardly. Of all the times for a monster to show<br/>up again, this was probably the worst.<p>* * *<p>END PART XV<p>Additional authors note:<br/>Some more clues about the enemy, Akane takes a good look at the sailor<br/>Sapphire poster and Ranma finds him/her self in a tough situation. All this<br/>and more in the next chapter.
