</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>First I would like to thank all the people for their reviews. The good<br/>and the bad. I know there are some grammar issues I need to work<br/>on. English is not my native language so keep an open mind.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean there not mine! Are you sure?<br/>Part II<br/>Implementation<p>Nodoka was busy clearing the table. Both she and Ranma had finished<br/>breakfast some time ago. Her son was currently in his room working<br/>on some secret project or another. She smiled slightly. Ranma really<br/>wasn't a good liar. He couldn't keep a straight face if his life depended<br/>on it. It was one of the things that remembered her of her son's<br/>childhood.<p>After breakfast he had grabbed some magazines and paper from the<br/>living room and locked himself in his room. He was probably writing<br/>his letter to Akane she thought. She put the dirty dishes in the sink<br/>and started the water running. Humming she continued with her work.<br/>Ranma was already much more relaxed since they left Nerima. Leafing<br/>for the summer was a good thing to do. And who knows what was best<br/>for her son than his own mother.<p>A noise of a door opening and the sound of running feet got her out of<br/>her mussing. A blur streaked past the kitchen door.<p>"I'mgoingtoexploretheneigberhood,bebackbeforelunchby!"<p>Nodoka blinked. It took her several seconds before she deciphered<br/>that. She blinked again. She could have sworn the blur was her son in<br/>his girl form wearing a yellow sundress and a straw hat.<p>The Nodoka logic system tried to digest this. Wearing a dress certainly<br/>wasn't manly. But since her son was in his girl form and currently her<br/>daughter it was appropriate. After all it would be a waste of all the<br/>clothes she bought for her niece 'Ranko'. After this conclusion she<br/>turned back to the sink and continued with her work.<p>* * *<p>Ranma was currently walking down the street towards the Juuban<br/>shopping district. She was somewhat oblivious to her surroundings<br/>staring at a piece of paper in her hand. It had taken some time to<br/>write this list with all the things she needed. It was also the reason<br/>why she was currently female and in a dress. Some of the items<br/>couldn't be bought when she was a boy without getting some stares.<br/>She sighed. Shortly before she left the Tendo dojo she had raided her<br/>father's cash stash. He would probably have spent it on booze anyway.<br/>Even with the extra money she did not know if it was enough for all<br/>the things she would need. This was the other reason why she was<br/>dressed the way she was. Who could resist a cute girl like her? It had<br/>worked in the past and it should work now.<p>"Let's see. The first item on the list... a white leotard." She frowned<br/>and looked around for a suitable clothing store. A shop on her left<br/>caught her attention. There was a sign in the window that said:<p>ON SALE NOW!<br/>Nerima Collection.<br/>50% discount<p>5 minutes later she exited the shop with a happy smile. What a lucky<br/>break! She bought a white leotard that was extremely durable, the<br/>sales lady said there was some material interwoven they used in<br/>bulletproof vests as well, some bracers and boots. Apparently the<br/>collection didn't sell as well in Juuban as it did in Nerima and the<br/>owner of the shop needed to get rid of the stuff leaving her with a<br/>good deal. No over powered martial artists here. She shuddered<br/>slightly as the thought of a crazy gymnast serviced. Luckily this leotard<br/>wasn't black.<p>* * *<p>Usagi drooled.<br/>There it was, all the ice cream she could possibly want just out of<br/>reach.<p>"It's not fair." She whined to herself. "Of all the times to be broke it<br/>has to be when the new ice-cream shop opened."<p>"That shouldn't be a problem" a voice broke to her self-pity.<p>She turned to her right to see a girl with red hair wearing a straw hat<br/>standing there. The strange girl smiled at her and a mischievous glint<br/>appeared in her eyes.<p>"Watch this." She said.<p>Ranma, as if you didn't know, walked to the counter of the ice-cream<br/>shop switching too her ultra cute girl mode. The young boy behind the<br/>counter was immediately shocked with sugar overdose. A short time<br/>later Ranma walked away with two ice cream parfaits, leafing the boy<br/>behind.<p>"Here you go." Ranma handed the blonde girl one of the parfaits.<p>"Thank you, thank you, thank you. That is really nice of you. My name<br/>is Usagi what's yours?"<p>Ranma was slightly shaken by the enthusiastic response from the girl.<p>"I... eeuh... Ranma"<p>"Thank's again Ranma-chan. You don't mind if I call you Ranma-chan<br/>do you? You can call me Usagi-chan. That's what friends do. I would<br/>like to be friends. You where really nice getting me that ice cream so<br/>you want to be friends right? Let's go sit over there."<p>Ranma was half dragged to one of the booths. She was slightly dazed<br/>from the bubbly friendliness this girl radiated.<p>* * *<p>Usagi and Ranma both walked towards the apartment Ranma and her<br/>mother where staying. Usagi had insisted on helping the short redhead<br/>with some of the packages she was carrying. Ranma didn't want to<br/>hurt her new friend's feelings, so she agreed. It was nice having a<br/>friend that didn't want to marry and / or kill her.<p>With a timid "Tadaima!" from Ranma both girls entered the apartment.<br/>The redhead was slightly worried about the reaction of her mother.<br/>Although she knew her mother wasn't bothered by her female form<br/>she hadn't worn female clothes since she stopped being 'Ranko'. She<br/>didn't consider that when she left this morning.<p>"Okaeri nasai, Ranma-chan." came her mother's voice from the<br/>kitchen.<p>Nodoka walked out of the kitchen. She noticed her child wasn't alone.<br/>A girl with blond hair in two ponytails and carrying some packages<br/>stood in the hall removing her shoos.<p>"Who is this dear?"<p>"eeuhm... This is Usagi mom. A friend I met today."<p>"That's nice dear. It is good to see you making some new friends.<br/>Lunch is almost ready and there should be enough for three."<p>Both the blonde and the redhead immediately brightened with the<br/>mentioning of food. After putting the packages in Ranma's room both<br/>Usagi and Ranma helped Nodoka set the table and bring out the<br/>dishes. With a chorus of "Itadakimasu!" both the girls started on there<br/>food. Nodoka was about too reprimand her child for eating so fast<br/>when she noticed Usagi was a close second in speed to Ranma. 'Oh,<br/>great. A second vacuum cleaner. You would almost think those two are<br/>related.' Ranma being used to another person eating at the table<br/>eating as fast as him absentmindedly started stealing food from<br/>Usagi's plate.<p>"Hey! That's my pickle." came the response from the blonde.<p>Ranma blinked. "Eeuhm..."<p>Then he noticed two pickles from his own plate disappearing. She<br/>began to grin. Soon the war was on. Both pair of chopsticks clattered<br/>in attack and defense. Ranma was clearly more skilled but Usagi was<br/>extremely determined when it came to her food. Both girls had huge<br/>smiles on their faces and Nodoka was glad to see her daughter was<br/>having some fun again. She hadn't seen Ranma this relaxed in a long<br/>time.<p>After lunch was finished they helped clean the table and Usagi had to<br/>leave. She promised Ranma she would be back tomorrow to show the<br/>red head around town and introduce her too some of her own friends.<p>* * *<p>The rest of the day Ranma stayed in her room working on the second<br/>stage of her plan.<p>"Sewing machines are for amateurs. Chestnut fist revised! Speed<br/>sewing!"<p>The one good thing about all the crazy martial arts forms Ranma had<br/>encountered was the ability to apply her skills to just about anything.<br/>It didn't take long before the design she had in mind was finished. She<br/>held up the sailor scout uniform she just finished and grinned.<p>"Am I the best or what?"<p>The uniform looked exactly like the regular scout uniform with a few<br/>alterations. The skirt was dark green with silver trim and she ditched<br/>the bows. They wouldn't last long in a fight anyway. Instead there<br/>were silver straps crossing the front of the uniform. The boots where<br/>the same color as the skirt with silver tips on the toes; long white<br/>gloves for the hands and a silver tiara to complete the ensemble.<br/>There was one last thing she picked up at a costume shop in town; a<br/>silver mask that covered her eyes to give some anonymity.<p>Finished with her work she cleaned up the mess in her room and hid<br/>the costume in the closet. It was almost time for dinner and she<br/>needed to wash up and change. Tonight the third part of her plan<br/>would be tested. She just hoped it would work.<p>* * *<p>After dinner Ranma told his mother he wanted to go to bed early<br/>because he was still tired. He waited an hour in his room before he<br/>heard his mother get ready for bed as well.<p>As silent as possible he opened his bedroom door and used his<br/>sneaking skills to get a glass of water from the kitchen. He sighed in<br/>relief when he returned and closed the door behind him. A splash and<br/>he transformation later he was damp and female.<p>It didn't take long before she had changed in her costume and put the<br/>silver mask on. She used a green bow to put her red hair in a loose<br/>ponytail instead of the pigtail. There was one problem though she<br/>didn't think of. The pendent from Akane. She frowned. This could be a<br/>problem. She contemplated leaving it behind but she really didn't want<br/>to do that. Then a solution presented itself. The silver tiara she bought<br/>had a fake gemstone imbedded in it. With some work she was able to<br/>remove it without damaging the tiara and replace it with the stone<br/>from the pendent. It actually looked better that way.<p>Satisfied whit the result she walked to the window of her room and<br/>opened it. Even though she was a considerable distance from the<br/>ground it wasn't a problem for the experienced martial artist. She<br/>jumped and grabbed the windowsill. With a few bounces she was on<br/>top of the buildings roof. Some of the stars were just coming out in the<br/>evening sky. Looking around over the district she spread out her<br/>senses. 'There'. She could feel something. It felt similar to the monster<br/>she had seen yesterday in the park. Whit a short run and a jump she<br/>was roof hopping in the direction she had felt the disturbance.<p>It didn't take long before she reached a deserted playground. Scanning<br/>around she searched for the disturbance she had felt. A high-pitched<br/>shriek caught her attention. It came from the other end of the<br/>playground. She started to run and screeched to a halt when she<br/>reached the scene.<p>A young girl was lying on the ground looking slightly bruised. A similar<br/>monster she had seen yesterday loomed over her.<p>"Hey ugly! Pick on someone your own size."<p>That caught the monsters attention and it turned towards Ranma. The<br/>redhead slightly shuddered when she noticed the 'face' of the creature.<br/>Where the eyes should have been where twin black holes devoid of<br/>any life. The monster started to approach fixed on its new target. It<br/>led out a high-pitched shriek and increased its speed. Ranma backed<br/>away quickly to lead the monster away from its girl that was still on<br/>the ground. When they where a good distance away. She stopped and<br/>settled in a loose defensive stance.<p>"Now let's see what you got ugly! Take this! VACUUM SHATTER!"<p>Ranma let loose whit a storm of small yellow blade like blasts. It was<br/>actually a combination of small vacuum blades and the technique<br/>Ryoga used when he threw his bandanas. The blasts were razor sharp<br/>and would cut through anything. The monster didn't stand a change<br/>and was reduced to dust.<p>"That was actually kind of easy." Ranma complimented herself with a<br/>smug smile. She heard a gasp and looked up from the pile of dust. Not<br/>far from here stood the girl from before with wide eyes.<p>The girl opened her mouth and asked with a shaky voice, "Who are<br/>you?"<p>***<p>END PART II
