</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>I hope you all still like this story. I sure do writing it. This story features<br/>an introduction to a scene I always wanted to do. Just read and find out!<br/>I will continue updating previous chapters to possible eradicate all spelling<br/>and grammar errors. Let me know if you find them.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean there not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART VIII<br/>Fashion daze<p>Ranma sighed. He corrected Ryoga's course again. The lost boy was in<br/>deep thought and didn't notice himself wandering off. Not that he would<br/>know if he paid attention though. Ryoga was thinking about the<br/>conversation he had with Ranma's mother. After her initial somewhat<br/>chilled greeting she invited him to stay for breakfast and was a gracious<br/>host for the rest of the morning. After he had mentioned Akari, she<br/>became quite interested actually. She grilled him with all sorts of<br/>questions about their relationship and why he was not with her at the<br/>moment. Shy as Ryoga was about the subject, Nodoka still managed to<br/>get the entire story about the family reunion and why he had wondered<br/>off. After giving him some practical advice on how to make it up to his<br/>girlfriend, she had all but ordered Ranma to escort Ryoga to the train<br/>station. He would get back to Akari's farm right away.<p>"She was probably right." Ryoga thought to himself. "I have to make it up<br/>to Akari." His pondering was interrupted when Ranma announced they<br/>were at the train station.<p>"Come one Ryoga. Let's buy you a ticket. Do you have enough money?"<p>"Yeah, yeah. Let's get going already." Ryoga was somewhat irritated being<br/>led around like a lost puppy by his friend / rival.<p>The ticket was bought and the lost boy boarded the waiting train. Ranma<br/>checked to make sure it was the right one. If it were up to Ryoga, he<br/>would probably manage to board a train to Kyoto.<p>* * *<p>"Come on Usagi! We don't want to be late." Makoto called to the blonde.<p>"I'm done. I just wanted to call Ranma and see if she would like to help as<br/>well. I just spoke to her mother on the phone and she would let Ranma<br/>know were we are."<p>"I haven't met her yet. You think she would give us a hand with the fair?"<p>"I'm sure she will. She could probably help you in the kitchen. Her mother<br/>is an excellent cook and I'm sure she taught Ranma some of it."<p>"We will see what she can do." Makoto replied without committing to<br/>anything.<p>Both girls were halfway through the front door when they were stopped by<br/>Usagi's mother.<p>"I almost forgot dear. Here are the extra cooking utensils and<br/>ingredients." She handed her daughter a large cardboard box.<p>"Thanks mom. I think we will need them."<p>"We appreciate it Ms. Tsukino." Makoto said.<p>"Don't mention it dear. It's for charity after all."<p>* * *<p>Nodoka looked up from the magazine she was reading when she heard the<br/>front door closing. Ranma entered the living room slightly damp and<br/>female.<p>She raised an eyebrow. "I thought those accidental splashes wouldn't<br/>happen anymore."<p>Ranma let out a snort. "I forgot to bring the pendant stone with me today.<br/>A water sprinkler caught me on the way back from the train station."<p>Her mother smiled. "Go dry yourself dear. I will get you some clean<br/>clothes."<p>"Thanks mom." Ranma headed for the bathroom. She decided to get a<br/>quick bath while she was here and changed back. A quick scrub later, she<br/>lowered herself in the relaxing warm water. A familiar tingle searched<br/>through her body when she changed back to a he. Ranma let out a sigh.<br/>He closed his eyes and relaxed. He was in the water for a few minutes<br/>when he heard the sound of his mother bringing clean clothes through the<br/>closed door.<p>"Better make this short." He mumbled lazily to himself. With some<br/>reluctance, he stepped out of the water. Grabbing a clean towel, he<br/>started to dry himself of. He stopped when he saw the clothes his mother<br/>had laid out for him. Looking around he noticed his old clothes were<br/>missing. With a sigh of defeat, he splashed himself with cold water from<br/>the sink changing to his girl form.<p>Grabbing the clean clothes, she started to dress. The outfit she ended up<br/>wearing was the female equivalent of her regular clothes. A red blouse<br/>and knee length black skirt. Unconsciously she checked the reflection in<br/>the mirror. Noticing everything was in order she went looking for her<br/>mother. She found her mother in the kitchen packing a box with food and<br/>other goods.<p>"What are you doing mom? And why am I dressed like this?" She pointed<br/>to herself.<p>"Your friend Usagi phoned while you were at the train station. It seems<br/>she and her friends are helping with the organization of a charity fair. She<br/>wanted to know if you would like to help as well." Closing the box she<br/>looked up to her daughter. "I gathered some things they might find<br/>useful." With a smile, she handed Ranma the box. "There is a note with<br/>the address by the phone. Have fun dear." She turned to the sink and<br/>went on with her regular chores. Ranma stood blinking in the middle of<br/>the kitchen.<p>* * *<p>Ranma looked up from the paper to the entrance of the school building. "I<br/>would have never imagined voluntarily coming here during the summer."<br/>She muttered. Finding the place where the fair would be held wasn't that<br/>difficult. The first clue was all the people carrying various things inside the<br/>school grounds. Following the stream of people, she was led to the schools<br/>soccer field. The field was cluttered with colorful tents and half built<br/>booths. How was she going to find Usagi in this mess? She thought to<br/>herself. Looking around her, she noticed a young woman with shoulder<br/>length black hair and a clipboard. She approached the women and tapped<br/>her on the shoulder to get her attention.<p>"Excuse me. Could you tell..." She was interrupted by the woman.<p>"Let's see what you've got there." She opened the top of the box Ranma<br/>was carrying. "Let's see. Food and kitchen supplies." She closed the box<br/>and pointed of into the field. "You need to be at the food section on the<br/>right of the field. Just ask for Makoto. She will help you along."<p>Ranma tried to ask a question but the woman was already occupied with<br/>yelling at a man that had dropped several tent poles.<p>Ranma shrugged and walked in the general direction the woman had<br/>pointed. It didn't take long before she just had to follow her nose; she<br/>could smell food being prepared. Her eyes lite up, this wouldn't be so bad.<p>She crossed an area with lots of tables and chairs and headed to where<br/>several field kitchens were set up.<p>"Are you Makoto?" She asked a girl with long brown hair.<p>The girls smiled. "That would be me. I see you brought some things for us<br/>to use?"<p>"Euh. Yeah. Where do I put it?"<p>"Just put it on one of the empty tables." Makoto waved behind her.<p>"Uhm, I'll do that. Could you tell me if I can find Usagi somewhere around<br/>here?" Ranma asked hopefully. The chance this girl would know where to<br/>find her friend was slim but it never hurt to ask. Usually.<p>"Usagi? Oh, you must be Ranma! I'm one of Usagi's friends. She told me<br/>you might show up today. She is kind of busy right now but she should<br/>show up around here in about an hour."<p>"Oh. I should wait then?" Ranma asked somewhat hesitantly.<p>"Why don't we look at the things you brought and we will see if we can<br/>get you something to do in the kitchen." Makoto walked the redhead to<br/>one of the tables.<p>* * *<p>"Where does this one go?" Usagi asked.<p>"I don't think we will be using that." Minako replied.<p>Usagi threw the yellow blouse on the discard pile. "The fashion club sure<br/>did deliver a lot of stuff. To bad we can't use it all."<p>The two blondes were in a large pavilion surrounded by clothes racks.<br/>They were discussing the outfits that would be shown on the charity fair<br/>fashion show later that day.<p>Usagi moved to the next item in the rack. "What is this?" She lifted the<br/>item from the rack. It was carefully wrapped in layers of plastic.<p>It took both girls to unwrap it. Their breath stopped in there throats when<br/>the saw the item inside.<p>"It's beautiful." Usagi whispered.<p>They held up a white western style wedding dress. A waterfall of stitched<br/>golden roses decorated the neckline and sleeves. White pearls sparkled in<br/>the sunlight giving the dress an almost magical appearance.<br/>Both girls had dreamy looks in there eyes. The spell was broken when a<br/>voice called for them.<p>"Are you two done yet?" Minako and Usagi turned and found Rei<br/>struggling her way between the clothes racks. The dark haired girl<br/>stopped when she saw the dress her two friends were holding.<p>"Wow. That's amazing. The fashion club sure outdid themselves on that<br/>one." Rei just stared at the dress. "Who is going to model it?" She asked.<p>Both blondes looked at each other. Minako with questioning looks. Usagi<br/>with a face concentrated in deep thought. There was a slight glint in her<br/>eyes.<p>"I think I have someone in mind." She said slowly. "I'm just not sure if<br/>she will be here today."<p>Minako and Rei looked puzzled. "Who did you had in mind?" Minako<br/>asked.<p>Usagi just smiled. "I will tell you when I'm certain. Let's just finish this<br/>and meet Makoto for lunch afterwards."<p>Minako and Rei looked at each other and gave a collective shrug. They<br/>would know in time.<p>* * *<p>Ami was making notes on a clipboard. She had volunteered to help with<br/>setting up a timetable for the fashion show. It was a tougher job that she<br/>thought. People didn't conform to a timetable as well as numbers did. She<br/>sighed. It was almost time to meet her friends for lunch. She started<br/>walking towards the corner of the soccer field where the field kitchens<br/>were set up.<p>When she got closer she noticed a lot of people where gathered around a<br/>single kitchen block. "I didn't know people thought Makoto's cooking was<br/>that good." She said to herself.<p>Carefully she worked her way through the crowd. Reaching the counter,<br/>she blinked when she saw what all the people were looking at. A certain<br/>red head was helping Makoto in the kitchen in the most unusual way.<p>While throwing several vegetables in the air, her hand holding a knife<br/>seemed to blur slicing the vegetables in mid flight. The peaces landed<br/>neatly on a platter. The crowd cheered. Ami first didn't notice Makoto<br/>trying to get her attention until the girl grabbed her arm and dragged her<br/>away from the kitchen.<p>"I need you to do a scan on Ranma." Makoto said to Ami.<p>"Why do you want me to do that? I already did that once and it showed<br/>nothing special." Ami was still slightly distracted.<p>Makoto frowned in frustration. "I was sure that would tell us something."<br/>She mumbled.<p>Gathering her composure, Ami turned her full attention towards her brown<br/>haired friend.<p>"Why did you want me to scan her?" she asked. "Rei asked me the same<br/>thing once."<p>"I don't know why Rei asked you that but I wanted to know because of<br/>this." She handed Ami a small package of spices.<p>Ami was confused. "What has this got to do with anything?"<p>"Don't you see? These are the same spices Sailor sapphire bought!"<p>"You think Ranma is sailor Sapphire based on some spices?" Ami asked<br/>uncertain?<p>"She does have red hair too you know." Makoto said "How many redheads<br/>do you know that bought spices lately?"<p>Ami nodded. "You've got a point there. Let's wait until the crowd dies<br/>down. I will get a clearer reading that way.<p>* * *<p>"This is not the Tendo dojo?"<p>"Stop bothering me peasant. Why you want to associate yourself with that<br/>lot is not any concern to me." Kodachi ignored the insignificant boy and<br/>continued her daydreaming about her darling Ranma.<p>* * *<p>END PART VIII
