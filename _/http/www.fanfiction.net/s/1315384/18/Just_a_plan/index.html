</div>Just a plan<br/>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>As you can see I'm back again. First a little review response, even if it is a<br/>little late. (author ducks below the thrown rotten tomato's.)<br/>Adyen, how did Ranma get a hold of the credit card? That's … a secret.<br/>Daniel Kim, I don't think Pluto will go hunting for 'silky darlings'. She<br/>might be going a little nuts but she id not the old pervert.<br/>anthony3755, I know Ranma his leaning to his female side. This is a SM<br/>crossover whit Ranma in a miniskirt after all. Don't worry though. I won't<br/>let you hanging.<br/>All other reviewers are thanked for there nice words.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>What do you mean they're not mine! Are you sure?<p>PART XVIII<br/>Let the fun begin<p>Ranma was a little bored. He had spent the morning practicing katas on<br/>the apartment building roof. There was just so much time you could<br/>practice without a sparring partner before it would get boring though. He<br/>was now sitting in his room juggling various items. He was actually<br/>waiting to hear some news from Usagi. If they could figure out the origin<br/>of those monster attacks in Juuban they could probably eliminate the<br/>problem.<p>That Ami girl seemed smart enough to figure it out though. He was no<br/>good at that stuff. She seemed real handy with that computer thingy of<br/>hers. He hated the waiting though. His usual adventures were more direct.<br/>Just follow the prince that kidnapped Akane and beat the snot out of his<br/>guards and then the prince himself. Clean and simple. All this mysterious-<br/>enemies-attacking-from-the-dark was not his thing. The monsters they<br/>send were good practice though.<p>Now he just wanted to be pointed at a target and go all out. He was bored<br/>with the waiting. He almost wished there would be some crazy martial<br/>artist challenging him by now. He shrugged. Perhaps he could do<br/>something else to pass the time. A little Experimentation with the<br/>Sapphire tiara could be interesting. Grabbing the tiara and holding it in his<br/>hands, he mused a little about what he had discovered about the stone so<br/>far. He knew the stone balanced his aura in regard to the water magnetic<br/>part of his curse. He also knew the stone was some sort of Ki storage<br/>device. He proved that when he had used it to create a glowing disk of<br/>energy that cut in half one of those monsters. The stone gave him some<br/>marginal control over the flight of this energy disk. He figured the stone<br/>synchronized with the aura of the user, thus giving him control since it<br/>was still part of him.<p>He wondered if he could increase that control. Unlike with his Ki blast,<br/>once he threw it, it was out of his control. Concentrating, he draw upon<br/>his Ki and focused it on the sapphire. The stone started glowing softly. He<br/>didn't want to force it the first time, so he didn't charge too much Ki into<br/>it. Once he was satisfied with the amount of Ki stored, he released his<br/>control. The stone still glowed softly. Reaching with his senses, he could<br/>feel his aura emitting from the stone. In a way it was weird. Theoretically<br/>any person who could feel auras would perceive this as if he was located<br/>in two places at the same time. That wasn't important right now though.<br/>Reaching out again, he felt the threads of energy that connected him with<br/>the stone. With some inspiration, he placed the tiara on the floor and took<br/>a step back. Feeling the threads, he tried to draw the Ki from the storage.<br/>He was pleased when he was flooded with the stored Ki. Stopping the<br/>stream, he tried charging the stone using the connection. That didn't<br/>seem to work though. Apparently he had to at least touch the stone.<p>Picking up the tiara, he stored some more Ki for further experimentation.<br/>Placing the tiara on the floor again, he thought about his next experiment.<br/>He had already experimented with manipulating the flight of the tiara but<br/>not with the conscious control over the shape the stored Ki took. He knew<br/>he could use it as a razor sharp disk with limited flight control. But what if<br/>he could blunt the edge, using it as a rubber band of sorts. He could<br/>literally bounce the tiara from any surface or prevent it from harming<br/>unintended targets.<p>With determination, he started concentrating. With the thought of an<br/>elastic band in mind, he tried to shape the Ki. Once he was satisfied, he<br/>used the control he had over the stone to make the tiara sort of jump<br/>from the floor. He was not prepared for what happened next though.<br/>Exerting a little bit too much force on the stone made the tiara jump into<br/>the air much faster then expected. It started bouncing from the ceiling<br/>and walls like a rubber ball on a sugar high. Ranma ducked when the out<br/>of control tiara almost took his head off.<p>Ranma groaned when he heard a shattering sound when the tiara crashed<br/>through the window and disappeared. "This is so not good." He thought to<br/>himself. He stiffened when he heard his mother knocking on the door of<br/>his room.<p>"Is everything alright in there, Ranma?" Came the voice of Nodoka<br/>through the closed door. "I thought I heard something breaking."<p>"Nothing to worry about mom!" Ranma replied, panicking. "Just a little<br/>accident. Nothing I can't handle."<p>There was a moment of silence. "Alright Ranma." Came the reply from his<br/>mother.<p>With a sigh of relief, Ranma heard his mother move away from the door.<br/>Now he had to act quickly. Luckily he had plenty of experience repairing<br/>broken windows while staying at the Tendo dojo. The damage didn't seem<br/>to be that severe. He would just sneak out, get some materials and repair<br/>the damage before anybody would notice. The only problem was locating<br/>the wayward tiara. Now where could that thing have ended up anyway?<p>* * *<p>Akane idly traced shapes into the grass with her finger while soaking up<br/>the rays of the sun. She wondered what Ranma was doing right now.<br/>Somehow she got the feeling he had done something stupid again. A<br/>squeal of laughter brought her back from her musing. She looked up to<br/>see Sakura playing happily in the nearby lake. Akane smiled. She really<br/>liked watching her little niece play. She was such a sweet girl. It made her<br/>smile and wonder what it would be like when she had kids of her own.<p>Her thoughts grinded to a halt and she examined that thought. She<br/>wondered when she started to think 'when' instead of 'if' about having<br/>children. And why was she thinking about children at the same time she<br/>was thinking about Ranma? She never thought like this before the failed<br/>wedding. Perhaps more had changed than she would admit. This required<br/>some serious thought.<p>* * *<p>Tired, bruised, wet and female, Ranma-chan dragged herself through her<br/>bedroom window. With her luck the tiara just had to land somewhere in a<br/>public bathhouse. She slumped tiredly to the floor. She didn't know what<br/>was worse, being chased by that horde of perverts, or the angry woman<br/>throwing bath supplies. Either way it was just another typical and chaotic<br/>episode that was the life of Ranma Saotome. At least she was able to<br/>retrieve the tiara.<p>Ranma-chan shivered slightly. Her wet clothes were cold. Sighing, she<br/>started to undress. "Better get some dry clothes one." She thought.<br/>Opening her closet, she rummaged through her stuff. She frowned when,<br/>after some searching, she failed to retrieve one of her trademark Chinese<br/>shirts or pants. Turning back to the closet she could only see her 'Ranko'<br/>stuff in there. "Now what am I going to wear?" She complained.<p>"You have plenty of pretty clothes, dear."<p>"Urk!" Ranma-chan turned around and looked at her mother standing in<br/>the door frame.<p>Nodoka just raised an eyebrow. "One of your friends called while you were<br/>out. She said there was a meeting at the shrine tonight."<p>Ranma-chan's eyes flashed in anticipation. Perhaps there would be some<br/>action tonight after all.<p>* * *<p>Ranma-chan grumbled in annoyance while she walked to the shrine. The<br/>evening wind blew through her scarlet locks. Her hair was bound back in a<br/>simple ponytail with a large blue bow. Ranma-chan was not happy. Just<br/>because she was going to a shrine, her mother thought it was a good idea<br/>to stick her in the traditional kimono and obi. Just because her mother<br/>would always wear them, didn't mean she should. Ranma-chan just<br/>grumbled some more. The only reason she was wearing it right now was<br/>because her mother had given her the look, although she had to admit,<br/>she did look good. The Kimono was made of dark blue silk with an<br/>intricate flower design decorating it.<p>She tried walking a little faster but the kimono hindered her movements a<br/>little more than she was used to. She was running late for the meting<br/>meeting as it had to have already started by now. It wouldn't be far to the<br/>shrine now though. Her thoughts were interrupted when she heard a faint<br/>sound in the distance she could not identify. It seemed to be getting<br/>closer though. Looking around she noticed what looked like a dust cloud<br/>getting closer. Was that faint shouting she was hearing?<p>"I'm so laaaaate!"<p>A blonde blur rushed by leaving Ranma-chan blinking. She was surprised<br/>when the blur stopped and rushed back to materialize as her friend Usagi<br/>in front of her.<p>"HiRanma-chan,!"<p>Ranma-chan was still trying to decipher that sentence, when her blonde<br/>friend took her hand and rushed off to the shrine dragging the redhead<br/>along with her.<p>It was an out-of-breath Usagi and a still confused Ranma-chan that finally<br/>stumbled inside the shrine home. Fortunately they had made it just in<br/>time not to be scolded by Rei.<p>When both girls had settled down, Ami cleared her throat to get<br/>everybody's attention. She pulled out her Mercury computer and pulled up<br/>a map of the Juuban district.<p>"The program that was analyzing the energy matrix from the monster<br/>fragment we found in the park, has completed its calculations."<p>"So? What does it say?" Rei asked.<p>Ami tapped a few commands into the computer and the map of Juuban<br/>was covered with red dots. The rest of the Senshi and Ranma-chan just<br/>looked confused.<p>Ami pointed to a large cluster of red dots on the map. "The program<br/>allowed me to do an accurate reading of the Juuban area and analyze the<br/>residual energy those monsters give off. When looking at the pattern on<br/>this map there is a large concentration of this energy located here. It's<br/>logical to conclude that is where our enemy is located."<p>Usagi looked over Ami's shoulder at the map displayed. "Hey. Isn't that<br/>where 'The Rocking horse' is located?"<p>Minako blinked. "That's the largest toy store in town! They have an<br/>excellent Sailor V doll collection though." She looked thoughtful for a<br/>second. "Perhaps I could get a doll and kick some enemy butt at the same<br/>time. Like hitting two birds that ends well."<p>The rest of the group just groaned. "It's 'hitting two birds with one stone'<br/>and 'all's well that ends well.'" Ami corrected the blonde.<p>Makoto just shook her head. "So we just go there and defeat the enemy?<br/>That's nothing new. We did it before and we can do it again."<p>Ranma-chan just nodded in agreement. She was all for the direct<br/>approach. Just kick the enemy's butt and be done with it.<p>* * *<p>Pluto Laughed evilly. Tonight would be the night. She could feel it. Her<br/>captor's attention had wandered off and it would only be a matter of time<br/>before he would leave again. When that happened she would make her<br/>move. She chuckled with glee thinking about the deserved punishment<br/>she would bestow on her imprisoner. A couple of 'dead scream's' would do<br/>the job nicely.<p>* * *<p>Akane was sitting at her desk in the guest room writing a letter, when she<br/>got the urgent feeling to grab her mallet. It was the feeling she got<br/>whenever Ranma would do something stupid or dangerous. She could<br/>admit now that she didn't want to see him hurt when embarking on one of<br/>those crazy adventures. And he always did get hurt in some way. And<br/>some of the time it was because he was trying to save her.<p>"Ranma. What are you up to?" She muttered with concern.<p>* * *<p>END PART XVIII<p>Additional authors note:<br/>I finished the last couple of chapters of 'Just a plan'. Expect them in rapid<br/>release after this chapter. (When I say finished, I mean finished as in<br/>collecting dust on my HD.) It will give me the change to give some review<br/>response.
