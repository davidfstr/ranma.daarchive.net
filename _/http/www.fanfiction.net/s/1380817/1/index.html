</div>Watermelon Girl<p>By Ron Dow75<p>Ranma was dressed like somebody out of a Tarzan movie,<p>Jane. In her leopard-skin one-piece she called out to her<p>husband as she bore their youngest child strapped to her<p>back, "Lunchtime, dearest!"<p>In his matching trunks, Kunou walked over slowly.<p>"We've been stuck on this island so many years...we're<p>lovebirds in paradise, right?" He put an arm over<p>Ranma's shoulder as they admired their four children.<p>"I'm so blissful," she said...<p>/<p>"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!" girl-Ranma<p>screamed!<p>She looked around, Where IS he! She was ready to<p>slap Kunou silly.<p>Then she realized, slap? Why would a martial artist<p>JUST slap? Why would a GUY slap!<p>While she was examining her open hand, the panda<p>smacked her with the back of its paw.<p>She came up from her roll, to demand, "Why'd you<p>do..." She finally realized that it had been a dream.<p>Now, it was night. They were in a real inn, something<p>that didn't happen much. They usually slept out. If they<p>made too much noise, they would be asked to leave.<p>Trust Pop to be more concerned about that than what<p>CAUSED her outburst.<p>It didn't help HER feel better knowing that Kunou was<p>the one picking up the tab.<p>She got up, and out to the 2nd story balcony. She<p>jumped out.<p>/<p>Girl-Ranma walked the beach under the moonlight alone.<p>She put her hands up to her biceps (pressing her chilled<p>boobs together) and wished she had brought a coat. At<p>least a long-sleeved shirt. Hot water would've helped!<p>Girls were more sensitive to cold than guys. He'd learned<p>that firsthand.<p>She was turning around to go back inside, when she saw<p>Watermelon Island. Even under the dim light it LOOKED<p>like a watermelon bobbing above the sea. But more to the<p>point, it was a deserted island with NOTHING but<p>watermelons growing on it. That is why it had become the<p>best place to train for the legendary "Kendo Watermelon<p>Technique". And the price everybody had mastered it<p>was amnesia.<p>Like Kunou. The samurai idiot had whacked HIMSELF on<p>the head with his own sword when one of the watermelons<p>he'd rigged to fall had landed on it. Ranma shuddered,<p>and this time not from the breeze coming off of the<p>ocean. The jerk had become an even bigger pain when he<p>DIDN'T know her! What restraint he HAD had was gone. He<p>was willing to go as far as to challenge her, "Date me or<p>die!" When she'd tried to escape, she ended up on that<p>island by herself with Kuno with nothing but her<p>swimsuit, and no hot water. Her only weapons against the<p>now (she'd thought) formidable swordsman were watermelons<p>and boulders. It was just Ranma's luck that a watermelon<p>had come back and conked her unconscious.<p>And that was when she first had that dream, of being<p>the trapped on that island, Eve to his Adam, mother of<p>their kids.<p>The dream hadn't ended there; it'd come back. What did<p>they say about dreaming of the same thing three times?<p>"I'm NOT gonna sleep," she swore.<p>/<p>...The man put an arm over Ranma's shoulder as they<p>admired their children.<p>"I'm so blissful," she said...<p>The nightmare was interrupted by, "Ranma, Wake up!<p>What are you doing out here?"<p>Ranma opened her eyes to see Akane, and then the<p>Kasumi. The eldest sister called to the rest of the<p>Tendous, "Akane's found Ranma!" They were all in beach<p>robes and swimsuits, carrying their beach bags. Though<p>there was still a chill in the early morning air, they<p>wanted to make the most of their last day at the resort.<p>Again, it took an adjustment to get away from that<p>horrible dream. She'd actually fallen asleep standing up,<p>leaning against one of the kissaten (tea &amp; coffee houses)<p>along the beach. That's right, after jogging around and<p>doing her katas, she'd thought about breaking in and<p>buying enough caffeine to keep a horse awake. ...And<p>drinks were yet another thing girls reacted more strongly<p>to.<p>Kasumi said, "Oh, my. Where did you find what you're<p>wearing, Ranma?"<p>Ranma looked down at the beach coverall she was<p>wearing, "Somebody threw it away. It's warm, so as long<p>as I'm a girl, I don't care what it looks like." In<p>keeping with the theme of the area, it had large<p>watermelon on it, below her bust.<p>Nabiki said, "Perhaps you should, Ranma."<p>Akane, now, saw what her sisters were talking about,<p>"No wonder the woman who was given that as a gift threw<p>it away: That's a maternity dress! What woman wants to be<p>reminded her belly will grow as big as a watermelon!"<p>Ranma did the pose as she stammered, "Ma, ma,<p>maternity...!" And she'd had the same dream THREE times!<p>No! Technically the last one WASN'T the same one! The<p>man in it hadn't BEEN Kuno, but some other, unknown guy<p>being the father of her children. So it wasn't going to<p>come true, WAS it!<p>Nabiki snickered, "That's some reaction you have<p>there."<p>Ranma reasserted her dignity, "So WHAT if it is, what<p>you say it is. I just need a belt or something to make a<p>waist, and anybody's gonna know." She actually wanted a<p>girl's narrow waist? It was better than having the<p>alternative for a girl.<p>Before the sisters could say anything, their father<p>was speaking, "Ranma, my boy! Your father is still eating<p>breakfast. But that is the last meal that Kuno-lad will<p>be paying for. But we've-" (Nabiki interrupted with,<p>"I found.") "-Nabiki has found that there is a way to<p>WIN a free three days and two nights stay at one of the<p>inns around here."<p>Tying the sash from Akane's beach robe around the<p>maternity coverall, Ranma asked sourly, "What stupid<p>martial arts event is it this time? Kickin' sand? Takin' a<p>sand castle? Turnin' seashells into ninja throwin' stars?<p>Cannonballs?"<p>Mr. Tendou assured her, "No martial arts at all. It is<p>merely an eating contest! I thought Genma and you would<p>enter for us!"<p>Kasumi smiled, "Oh, my, yes! If there are any people<p>who know how to eat, it's the Saotomes!"<p>Nabiki said, "And she says it like it's a good thing."<p>Akane didn't like the idea of being left out, "Hey,<p>what about me?"<p>Nabiki said, "You're on a diet, Akane. You're always<p>on a diet."<p>Kasumi said, "And an eating contest gives her the<p>perfect excuse to leave off the dieting! Go for it,<p>Akane!"<p>Nabiki said, "Under THAT logic, I might as well enter,<p>too."<p>After adjusting for a few more wrinkles, Ranma pulled<p>the loose part of the coverall out as she looked past her<p>bust, "There! Now the watermelon on this thing looks like<p>a giant pickle."<p>Nabiki said, "Leave it to you, Ranma, to get into a<p>pickle."<p>/<p>While Mr. Tendou went to the small village down the<p>coast that was sponsoring the contest, Akane and Ranma<p>went to the closest restaurant that was open. The redhead<p>told the waitress, "Hot water, no tea."<p>Akane asked, "What kept you out of your room all<p>night, Ranma? Kunou?"<p>Girl-Ranma flinched. "No. I just had a...bad dream."<p>Her voice had gotten quieter.<p>Akane said, "More of those nightmares of yours? You<p>won't tell me about them, but perhaps you should see a<p>councilor you can talk to. There may be a pattern."<p>Ranma glared at her, "Have my head shrunk!" She<p>paused as the waitress came with their complimentary<p>water. When they the waitress had left, Ranma picked her<p>cup, "The problem is that my head DOES shrink!" And she<p>poured the hot water on her head.<p>"Akh!" guy-Ranma cried, loosening the sash tightened<p>for a wasp waist.<p>Akane tensed. But it didn't seem as if the few people<p>around noticed Ranma changing into a guy. Now if he had<p>been wearing a bikini...<p>Akane still lowered her voice, "Are you sure that<p>nothing happened on that island, yesterday?"<p>Ranma didn't LIKE remembering it. "I told you, ALL<p>that happened was I lost to ONE watermelon. It was a<p>fluke!" He didn't want to tell Akane how she had reacted<p>like a scared girl when the jerk threatened her with his<p>wooden sword. She had actually teared up and ran! Then,<p>instead of pulling out her martial arts techniques, she'd<p>gone straight to her girl tactics, calling him darling<p>and acting like she would LIKE to hug, and kiss, maybe<p>even... Ranma's stomach knotted.<p>Akane said, "Uh, hunh." Ranma was blocking what could<p>happen to a girl who was passed out and protected only by<p>a guy's honor. And Kunou had certainly been acting less<p>than honorably!<p>But Akane had looked for the signs on Ranma's legs,<p>and on the swimsuit she took off before changing back.<p>When they got back, she had asked Kasumi to look for<p>anything different about Ranma's laundry. She had even<p>thought about splashing cold water on Ranma before she<p>went to the toilet, and then sneaking in with a home<p>pregnancy test.<p>All of that had made her VERY uncomfortable. It was<p>acknowledging that Ranma could be more of a girl than she<p>liked to think about. She just hoped Dr. Tofu's research<p>was correct and that a cursed female would be stuck in<p>whichever form became pregnant. So, since Ranma COULD<p>change, that meant Ranma WASN'T, right!<p>Scowling, Ranma asked, "Where IS the mental case?"<p>"Kunou SHOULD be in a hospital. But I hear he went<p>looking for priestess in the area who's famous for her<p>healing powers and exorcisms."<p>"Hmf! Maybe she can get rid of his stupidity demon."<p>"That would be stupid. Then you couldn't trick him."<p>"But he'd be smart enough to know I'm NOT a girl!" Did<p>he feel a pang?<p>That got some attention from the customers.<p>Akane took Ranma's hand, "Come on."<p>Ranma asked, "But what about breakfast?"<p>"We're in an eating contest. You know what they say,<p>"You have to have a hunger to win." More people were<p>staring at them. "Er, Ranma, about the maternity dress<p>you have on as a guy...?"<p>/<p>Kunou walked up the steps of the Shinto temple. He<p>yelped in surprise to find somebody unexpectedly standing<p>at the top, as if waiting. The ugly, little, old man<p>dressed as a Buddhist monk told him, "You have a most<p>unfortunate face."<p>Kunou didn't normally strike holly people. But he felt<p>a strong urge to harm THIS one. "Why did you startle me<p>as you did, monk! IF that is what you truly are," he<p>threatened with his wooden sword.<p>"Don't you want to know about your fortune?"<p>Kunou yelled, "I HAVE people who look after my<p>fortune! Why would I want to hire you!"<p>A woman interrupted them, "Uncle! What have I told<p>you about showing your ugly face around the temple!<p>You're bad for business! People get the idea you're a<p>demon painting come to life!"<p>Kunou marveled. This mature woman of thirty in the<p>attire of a Shinto priestess was as beautiful as her<p>uncle was not. He stepped on the obnoxious, little man as<p>he approached her, "My Dear Woman, I am seriously tempted<p>to disregard the differences in our ages, and DATE with<p>you!"<p>She looked at the youth hard in his eyes, "And it's<p>idiot men saying things like that which has driven me<p>AWAY from the populated areas they're the densest! Now,<p>come!" she said turning for the modest temple. "You must<p>be here about a recent spell of amnesia."<p>The still smitten samurai lad followed, "Priestess!<p>Your ability to discern ailments is wondrous."<p>"No. I heard that yet another kendo idiot had taken<p>the legend of Watermelon Island seriously without<p>checking the facts." And Kunou, as usual, WAS dressed the<p>part.<p>When they got to the temple, the priestess had the boy<p>sit on the ground, while she sat on the porch. She ran<p>her hands up along his neck and on up, and through his<p>hair. "You have a lot of bumps on your head."<p>"It is the fault of that accursed Ranma Saotome! He<p>walks over others: Even *I*, his sempai and Noble Lord of<p>Nerima!"<p>"I see. But HE wasn't the one responsible for you<p>losing your memory."<p>"But he WAS. It was because of that low man I needed<p>to take drastic steps to advance my already notorious<p>swordsmanship. It is only by defeating him that I can<p>release the hold he has on the two that I love above all<p>others."<p>"I see," the priestess said in a noncommittal tone as<p>she took something out from under her white jacket.<p>"And most despicable of ALL his dastardly deeds is the<p>black magic he uses to separate the Pigtailed Girl from<p>any sort of a normal life!" he wept at the thought.<p>"...Or love."<p>Paying more attention to the stethoscope now in her<p>ears, she said, "Be quiet! I'm trying to listen to your<p>thorax." To his unasked question, the woman told him as<p>she thumped his chest, "I am also a qualified nurse." It<p>took her only a few more moments to determine, "Your eyes<p>are not dilated, your skin is not clammy, your pulse is<p>normal, nor there is no sign of internal abnormalities.<p>And your chi energy is flowing for what I judge is normal<p>for you. As far as I can tell without an MRI, you've<p>sustained no lasting damage. I would recommend you<p>REFRAIN from any further fighting or strenuous activity<p>for at least two weeks."<p>"TWO WEEKS!" Kunou cried in agony. "I cannot stand<p>the thought of my Pigtailed Venus being in clutches of<p>that merciless VILLAIN Saotome for one second more than I<p>can help it!"<p>The ugly, old Buddhist monk surprised them as he again<p>appeared as if from nowhere, "If the girl is under a<p>spell, perhaps another spell is needed."<p>A crosshatch appeared on the priestess as she made a<p>fist, "Uncle! We don't NEED to get involved in this<p>affair!"<p>But for once, Kunou had picked up on an idea, "Of<p>course! It takes a spell to break a spell! I will reward<p>you munificently if you can deliver me the Pigtailed<p>Girl!" He then picked up his wooden sword, "And once I<p>have HER, Saotome's distraction from his sense of loss<p>will then lead to his, true and PERMANENT loss!"<p>The monk said to his niece, "You are right. This is no<p>affaire of ours."<p>Kunou blinked. "Name your price: Gold! Jewels!<p>Priceless antiques! Stocks listed on the Nikkei<p>Exchange!"<p>The gnome-like man said took a praying posture, "I am<p>a simple monk, and my needs are simple."<p>Kunou understood. If the holy man was a wanderer, then<p>the only things he had need of were clothing and, "A<p>year's supply of French haut cuisine!"<p>The man AND his niece cried, "Sold!"<p>/<p>Soun hurried back to the resort. After a frantic<p>search, he found the panda sitting out on the beach<p>wearing a sunhat, a wet towel and fanning itself. "Genma!<p>I have great news! The upcoming contest is the<p>opportunity we've been looking for that will INSURE Ranma<p>marries my daughter Akane!"<p>The panda held up a sign, [?].<p>"It seems that up until a few years ago, the village<p>lived in fear of what they called their watermelon god.<p>Though they grew them, nobody dared eat one, or sell any<p>to outsiders until they'd appeased the god. They would<p>select one watermelon each year and subject it to a<p>special process that would cause it to grow larger than<p>all of the others! This would be the living embodiment of<p>their god. When it had ripened they would put it on the<p>altar of the Great Watermelon, and on the appointed day-<p>Today!-the whole village would engage in rituals<p>designed to calm its spirit!"<p>The panda held up a sign, [So?].<p>"As I said, that changed a few years ago. The mayor<p>called on a priestess and a monk to rid the village of the<p>danger from its possible anger once and for all. When<p>asked what that was, they couldn't be told. The villagers<p>had been living in fear for so many generations, that they<p>forgot what would happen if the watermelon spirit were<p>NOT pleased."<p>The panda didn't hold up a sign. It was losing<p>interest.<p>"Well, before the exorcists had a chance to rid the<p>village of the spirit, the Great Watermelon got very<p>angry and attacked every man in the village."<p>[And the village discovered what the watermelon did.]<p>"Exactly! But not until they sent the exorcists away,<p>unpaid. Then, rather than get rid of its vengeful spirit,<p>the elders of the village decided to hold a festival to<p>attract tourists!"<p>[So that the TOURISTS could be the sacrifices.]<p>"Exactly!"<p>/<p>In her robe and swimsuit, Kasumi found her sister,<p>"Nabiki! It's time to go to the contest."<p>Nabiki remained where she was sunbathing on the beach.<p>"I'm not going. You really didn't think I was serious<p>when I said I might as well enter, did you? Eating<p>contests are messy and disgusting. And what goes in, MAY<p>come out."<p>"Suit yourself."<p>"Kasumi! I'd recommend YOU didn't go either, even as a<p>spectator."<p>"And why not, Nabiki?"<p>"I can read the signs. Panda signs."<p>/<p>A few kilometers down the coast, around a promontory<p>was a typical village by the sea, under terraced farms in<p>the foothills that reached down to its long, wide, and<p>little used beach. It was almost as if it were out of an<p>earlier time, despite the resort being so close. Looking<p>down on idyllic setting, Akane had to wonder, "What keeps<p>the tourists and developers away?"<p>Ranma's only answer was his stomach growling.<p>The two fathers pointed up the long, stone flight of<p>stairs in a grassy hill. Mr. Tendou told Ranma and Akane,<p>"All contestants must present themselves before the their<p>idol on the altar at the top."<p>Mr. Saotome said, "It is all part of the local<p>ceremony."<p>Ranma had been all around and into the deepest parts<p>of Japan, and knew how seriously the locals took their<p>own peculiar customs. The pigtailed boy started up the<p>stairs, "Aren't you comin', Pop? You're in this thing,<p>too, aren't you?"<p>Genma held up his hands and waved him off, "No! Heh,<p>heh! There must be an age limit! This is something best<p>entered into by a young couple!"<p>Soun told his accomplice, "Saotome, I think you're<p>telling more than enough."<p>Agreeing, both of them fled.<p>Akane said, "I've got a feeling they're not telling US<p>enough."<p>Ranma told her, "Forget about it. Let's get the stupid<p>part over with, so I can get to eatin'. I'm starvin'! I<p>ain't had nothing since yesterday."<p>At the very top, out in the open, was a sturdy, three-<p>tiered Shinto wooden altar with sake, rice balls, and<p>other offerings. But what REALLY drew their eyes was what<p>was the idol, judging by the zigzag paper gohei draped<p>over the thing on top. It was a watermelon. A huge<p>watermelon. A watermelon the size of a boulder!<p>Both Ranma and Akane nearly did facefaults. Ranma<p>cried, "I'm not THAT hungry!"<p>Akane held her own belly, "It makes me sick just to<p>look at it. Anything THAT big can't be good to eat."<p>An middle-aged woman in a kimono came around from the<p>other side, "Oh, goody, more outsiders! Come, the contest<p>tables are on this side."<p>There were four low tables arranged in a semi-circle<p>around the Great Watermelon altar, with more that could<p>be set down if more contestants showed up. There was a<p>shy couple that looked like newlyweds; a thug-type with<p>bulging muscles and tattoos; two middle-aged couples, one<p>drunk, the other arguing; and a very old man who could<p>barely stand up on his own. And, with his back away from<p>them, standing over a pile of watermelons, somebody they<p>DID know.<p>Ranma went up to him, "Hey, Kunou! How's the head<p>case?"<p>Kunou yelped in surprise, "Ranma Saotome!" dropping<p>what he'd had in his hand.<p>Lucky for him, his arch-enemy didn't notice the<p>hypodermic needle. "So," Ranma said, "you're in this<p>contest, too?"<p>Kunou asked, "I wanted a match with the Pigtailed<p>Girl! You're not trying to prevent my challenging her!"<p>"You mean, "If she wins, you would date with her"? As<p>good a reason as that is for her NOT to show up, she has<p>no choice. This is a WATER-melon eating contest. Cold<p>watermelon."<p>"I don't understand!"<p>"Nothing new there."<p>Akane pushed Ranma away, "We have to find a place for<p>you to change. Honestly, I don't know what our fathers<p>were thinking: Insisting you show up as a guy!"<p>Before Kunou could regale the sturdy and true Akane<p>Tendou with poetic verse without rhyme or reason, he<p>remembered his mission. If he could remain focused on<p>that, he'd be able to indulge himself to his heart's<p>content. He found the needle. There was just a few drops<p>of solution left in the syringe. He looked for the<p>watermelon with the tiny puncture hole. "I must mark it,<p>so that I know WHICH of them has the magic potion in<p>it..."<p>But as he looked, and searched, finally tearing at his<p>hair: "I don't know which one it IS!" He dropped to his<p>knees, "If only I had THOUGHT to bring faithful Sasuke<p>with me! I could blame HIM for this grievous error!"<p>/<p>Ranma and Akane, the single females, sat on a blanket<p>at the same table. Each couple was together at their own<p>ones, and the thug and geezer sat at the same table.<p>Kunou had bought the right to have a table all to<p>himself. On the end next to Ranma's and Akane's, of<p>course. Akane had made sure Ranma was closer to him,<p>which nearly made the pigtailed girl loose her appetite.<p>Akane looked at the pile of watermelons, waiting to be<p>eaten. There had to be at least a hundred. "I hope this<p>isn't about how many you can eat."<p>Confident, Ranma-chan put her hands back behind her<p>head, "If it is, I bet I can win, even with a girl's<p>smaller stomach. And if it's about speed, I have the<p>training I got in "Martial Arts Dining" when I was<p>engaged to Picolette." Suddenly she froze in déjà vu.<p>As the condition for the training, Ranma had committed<p>herself to becoming "Mrs. Picolette Chardin II". If she<p>hadn't won the showdown dinner, she'd have been honor<p>bound to be marry the guy! She had dreamed of the<p>wedding. Alone, the two of them had eaten the giant<p>wedding cake together. Ranma's grin had been large enough<p>to wrap around a watermelon! LITERALLY, thanks to the<p>grotesque methods their methods could lead to.<p>In her dream, her mouth had become a vacuum hose and<p>had actually REACHED out to kiss the blonde! Had she<p>actually LIKED it when Picolette had sucked face?<p>Ranma's arms and head dropped. Of COURSE she didn't<p>want to marry Picolette, and DEFINITELY not Kunou.<p>But...were those dreams her subconscious trying to tell<p>her that, that, maybe, perhaps, the girl in her had the<p>urge to find a guy?<p>She thought about that maternity coverall she had put<p>on. DID she have maternal instincts?...<p>The oldest of the townsladies got up to explain the<p>rules. Akane looking at the few people off to the side,<p>she said, "Ranma, did you notice that all of the<p>spectators and officials are women? And none seems<p>younger than 45-years-old."<p>Ranma-chan was too lost in her own disconcertion to<p>respond.<p>The matriarch in a kimono said, "The rules are these:<p>One person at a time will get up and insult the Great<p>Watermelon." She gestured to the monster one on the altar<p>before them. "If any of you are at a loss of what to call<p>it, we have women with cue cards standing up." Two of the<p>older ones knelt on either side of the altar, their<p>poster boards on the ground beside them. "You then do the<p>GRAVEST insult of all, and EAT as many watermelons as you<p>can in front of it-As viciously as you can!<p>"Then the next person will be given their chance. That<p>is all."<p>Akane raised her hand, "Excuse me, Ma'am. But what if<p>there's a tie?"<p>She paused in her hasty withdrawal long enough to say,<p>"I don't think we will have to worry about any ties."<p>The thug pushed the old geezer down, and claimed first<p>up. Mixed with a torrent of profanity (which the old<p>ladies bore with the grace of good hostesses) was his<p>bragging about what a stud he was, and that he didn't<p>NEED a fourth-rate god like this one to prove what a man<p>he was! He'd come here at the end of summer to smash the<p>biggest watermelon in the world, just like a favorite<p>Japanese game did! He didn't even need a baseball bat!<p>Without a score card, it really didn't make much<p>sense; and trying to close her ears to the foul language<p>didn't help Akane understand what its purpose was. But<p>she was becoming suspicious. And uneasy.<p>Meanwhile, Kunou had "decided to stretch his legs"<p>while he waited. He strode past the cue card lady,<p>pretending she wasn't there. He glanced around without<p>seeing, then ducked around towards the front of the Great<p>Watermelon. He said to himself, "Why take a chance with<p>ONE small fruit of the vine? If the legend is correct,<p>THIS one shall surely deliver my love!" He took out his<p>hypodermic needle and stabbed it into the monster fruit.<p>The watermelon god buckled, its bulk retreating from<p>the needle that had injected it. It rolled to the far<p>edge of the altar, where it trembled and shook. Kunou<p>(and everybody else) stared in dumb awe at the now<p>animate object. The hand with the needle was frozen up in<p>the air.<p>The needle not a threat, for the moment, the huge<p>fruit jumped back, knocking Kunou flat on his back. It's<p>great weight broke its altar.<p>But the Great Watermelon did not fall. It hovered,<p>rolling in midair.<p>Kunou reached for his sword. Finally, the Kendo<p>Watermelon Slicing Technique would be of real used! But<p>the boulder-like idol started bouncing on him. He never<p>had a chance. He was pounded into the ground.<p>Ranma cried, "Aw, GEEZ! I hate to hafta say this, but<p>I guess I gotta save the jerk." She tossed regular-sized<p>watermelons at it. They smashed up against the thick rind<p>of the monster watermelon. While the attack did no harm<p>to it, it DID draw its attention to Ranma.<p>Ranma was on it, and kicked it away from the now<p>unconscious Kunou.<p>But the watermelon spirit used its power to bring its<p>home back, aiming to bounce on Ranma now. Leaping aside,<p>the pigtailed girl cried, "Tenshin Amagakuren, Revised:<p>WATERMELON Roasting Over an Open Fire!" And chopped at<p>it repeatedly with the side of her hand. She was cut the<p>largest watermelon slice anybody had ever seen.<p>The watermelon god rolled, twisted, and writhed; then<p>bright light of its spiritual energy shone through its<p>open wound. Akane said, "I think Ranma just made it mad."<p>Suddenly, the two circles appeared where Ranma had hit<p>it with the smaller watermelons. Theses combined with the<p>missing slice to make a face, two red eyes and a mouth<p>with black seeds for little teeth. The final phase of it<p>anthropomorphism came when it sprouted vines that became<p>arms, and legs, with hands and feet.<p>Ranma said, "This is STUPIDER than even that enchanted<p>panda drawing I had to date."<p>The watermelon screamed, "No! No, no, no! No! I'll<p>never forgive you! How...How could you CUT me!<p>Prepare to meet your doom, ALL of you!"<p>The thug cried, "YES! This is what I was WAITIN'<p>for!" And he cracked a watermelon in two.<p>The husband of the drunk couple said, "It's a good<p>thing I think this is just the booze."<p>The wife of the other couple said, "Ikki! We came her<p>to make a man out of you: Now be one!"<p>"Yes, dear!" he said, biting into a slice of one of<p>his watermelons.<p>Sharing a large slice of their own, the newlyweds said<p>as one, "This is what we came here for, to start our<p>marriage with children!"<p>Akane GOT it! No WONDER only the only towns people at<p>the contest were women too old to have-"Ranma! Don't let<p>the seeds TOUCH you: That's a FERTILITY god!"<p>NOW Ranma was worried: "A WHAT!" It was a good thing<p>that just like she could snatch chestnuts from a fire<p>without getting burned, she could break open the rind<p>without getting wet from its meat.<p>The Great Watermelon god spit seed after seed at the<p>human girl that had wounded it. Ranma leaped. The seeds<p>followed. She somersaulted away, making sudden changes of<p>direction to stay just one vault from the fecund seeds.<p>And she couldn't return to any place she HAD been,<p>because it was covered with watermelon seeds and slime!<p>If she slipped on the slime...<p>While the other contestants complained about NOT being<p>spit on, Ranma was saying, "This is no good! I can't stay<p>on defense! It can fly! All it has to do is get high<p>enough and strafe me! I need to attack it! But HOW!"<p>A glance at Akane saw that SHE was putting her fists<p>through a couple of watermelons, as if they were boxing<p>gloves. Of course! Ranma now knew what to do!<p>She backflipped for the slice she'd cut out of the it.<p>Quickly, but carefully, lifting it up, she used the wedge<p>as a shield-And shoved it into the 'grapping mouth' of<p>the monster watermelon.<p>The watermelon god made noises, but it could not be<p>heard because of the gag. Ranma said, "Okay: NOW, what do<p>I do!"<p>While she was thinking, she got pelted by seeds. THIS<p>time from the angry contestants and THEIR watermelons. It<p>was only a matter of seconds before THEY attacked Ranma!<p>The Great Watermelon started rising up into the air.<p>"Oh, no you don't!" Ranma cried, jumping to keep the<p>wedge-gag pressed into its "mouth".<p>As Ranma held on and rode the thing as it rolled<p>around in midair, she knew she had only once chance. And<p>if one chance was all she had, then she HAD to take a<p>risk! At the top, she let go of the giant wedge, and ran<p>to stay on top of the watermelon. Which amazed the<p>contestants enough for them to stop them in their tracks.<p>She knew that the watermelon spirit inside was going to<p>bring its now open "mouth" around to spit seeds at her,<p>perhaps even "swallow" her, but...<p>Just when she judged its mouth was on the other side,<p>she focused all of her strength at ONE point in the rind:<p>KER-rack-shaaarrk! That blow cracked the watermelon all<p>the way around from top to bottom. The weakest area was<p>the open slice facing the ground, and THAT was the<p>direction the seeds and slime burst out of!<p>Ranma leaped far away the fertilier that the other<p>contestants ran to bathe in. Standing on the ground, she<p>watched the white glow of the spirit rise into the sky from<p>the hulk of the great watermelon. She laughed, "Without<p>a place to stay in, it CAN'T hang around: Threat over with!<p>*Ha, ha, ha!*" Why was a part of her was NOT so relieved.<p>She laughed too soon. The white light dropped back<p>down, picked up the two halves of the monster watermelon,<p>and brought them over to the human mocking it. SMOOSH!<p>Ranma was totally immersed wet slime and seeds inside the<p>two halves.<p>Just when Ranma thought she might drown, they fell<p>away. Harvest time was over with, and the fertility<p>spirit had to depart for another year.<p>Akane cried, "Ranma! Ranma, speak to me!"<p>She spit out a fountain of slime and seeds. Akane<p>wasn't worried enough about Ranma to get THAT close to<p>being fertilized.<p>She remembered, "Oh! Hot water!" She tossed the lid<p>of the teakettle she'd borrowed and threw it on the girl<p>Ranma. From a distance.<p>The wind was with her. The hot water splashed Ranma.<p>Only Ranma didn't change: Ranma remained a girl!<p>While Akane stood there stricken by the terror, Kunou<p>had come to. He ran to her, "The Pigtailed Girl!" He<p>pulled her limp, slimy form up against him, and prayed,<p>"Please, let the legends be true! Let there really BE a<p>fertility god!"<p>Finding her strength, Ranma shoved the creep away,<p>"Even IF the damned thing DID make me fertile, I have to<p>DO something about it for it to MEAN anything-And if YOU<p>think I'm gonna let you-"<p>Kunou said, "But the deed is, I dare hope, already<p>done, My True Love! I injected a magic solution into the<p>watermelon that contained my OWN love!"<p>"YOU WHATTT!"<p>"You have no choice but to marry me, now, My Beloved<p>Mother-To-Be! Such is the ancient ways, even Saotome will<p>have to give you up!"<p>Akane screamed as an ugly, little Buddhist monk<p>appeared beside her, "Wishful thinking on his part. He is<p>a most unfortunate soul." It was now safe for him to<p>appear.<p>A glamorous woman dressed like a Shinto priestess told<p>them, "It did not contain ANY of his spermatozoa."<p>Kunou protested, "I did not say it did! But it WAS a magic<p>potion! From the ingredients I provided! You GUARRANTEED<p>your work—It was IN the contract!"<p>The monk said, "He supplied us with the hair, nail<p>clippings, skin flakes, blood, mucus, and...OTHER bodily<p>fluids of the females he desired to be his. (So<p>un-Buddha-like.)"<p>Kunou nodded curtly, "Yes. I have my manservant Sasuke<p>collect those mementos of the two I most dearly love in<p>this world! He is most thorough, if LAX about labeling<p>which of my true loves they came from."<p>The priestess said, "Yes, I suspected the samples were<p>contaminated with another's."<p>The monk said, "And those ARE the necessary<p>ingredients for most love potions."<p>The priestess told him, "But YOU turned it into a<p>fertility potion by bringing it here! Subjecting it to<p>the higher rules and vagaries of a god!"<p>The monk also informed him, "Now, if he had supplied<p>some of his OWN seed..."<p>Kunou blushed bright red, "I COULDN'T!"<p>Akane went up to the priestess (and away from the<p>little man who made her skin itch), "Then Ranma ISN'T<p>pregnant?" she hoped.<p>The beautiful priestess told her, "I cannot guarantee<p>that. The idiot supplied us with SO much material from<p>the two females he has his crush on, there HAD to be<p>quite a lot of stem cells. Under the proper conditions,<p>stem cells CAN be used to pass on genetic information. I<p>hear that theoretically they could even be used to make a<p>MAN pregnant."<p>Akane gasped, "Y, you mean, Ran, Ranma's the father of<p>her own *gulp* child!"<p>The priestess said, "Of course not! Where would the<p>morality be in that? We ARE spiritual people. We would<p>never allow that to happen."<p>Before anybody could sigh in relief, the monk said,<p>"If she is pregnant by anybody, it is by the OTHER girl."<p>Ranma cried, "You mean AKANE'S the father!"<p>Akane fainted.<p>The priestess said, "Stand back! I can help: I'm an<p>expert in modern medicine!" Over her shoulder, she told<p>the pigtailed girl, "You're next!"<p>As the monk was about to start his praying for Ranma,<p>he said, "I hope you WANT a child. A fertility god will<p>haunt you until you DO have one."<p>'<p>'<p>The End.<p>'<p>[Author's notes: Stem cells can be found scattered in<p>small amounts throughout the body, especially in bone<p>marrow and the dental roots. Stem cells from a mother can<p>survive well into her children's adulthood.<p>'<p>[The idea for this story STARTED from the dream Ranma had<p>about having kids with Kunou. The dream where she marries<p>Picolette is found in the anime, not in the manga. But I<p>think it is appropriate to add it because it seems in<p>keeping with the first dream. Then I needed something to<p>feel out the story, and provide an excuse for some<p>action. The Great Watermelon god comes from an episode of<p>"Urusei Yatsura" (better known as "Lum"), ALSO created by<p>Rumiko Takahashi. THERE it was thought just stupid that<p>the "god" would punish people by spitting seeds on them.<p>In MY version, nine months later, they found that it had<p>done MORE (as in population explosion). Of course, in the<p>original story, Lum, Ataru, Shinobu, Mendou, the<p>priestess AND monk had ALSO gotten slimed. But since THEY<p>didn't become more fertile (that we know of), I made this<p>a possibly different world from theirs. That is why I<p>NEVER mentioned the names of the priestess and monk.]
