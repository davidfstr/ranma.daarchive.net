</div>(Huh, So far only two reviews. I know the only reason is because it's short but hey it's a prologe! Huh. Well Both those reviews wanted more. Best reviews I've ever gotten almost. Well, I don't have anything to talk about. I got nothing bad! Not even Criticism on my, once again, bad spelling. It's great! I can start the story right now!)<p>Chapter 1<p>A man walked slowly down a small road. He was not a happy camper. He was out for revenge. THAT DAMN GUIDE! He should have TOLD me the springs were cursed! Instead he blabbed on about the things that drowned there! OH I'm gonna kill him right after I find out how I got into this body.<p>It was obvious the man was angry.<p>"I don't understand it, That water wasn't cold at all... so how did I change into this? And what was it that face said? You have recieved the blessing of Jousenkyo? THIS ISN"T A BLESSING! I know my original curse turned me into a man, but now i'm stuck as one! And at least then I looked decent! NOW I'M AN UGLY MAN TOO! HOW CAN I LIVE IN THE BODY OF AN UGLY MALE!"<p>1000 years later...<p>"YES! I DON'T KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED BUT I BECAME HOT! I recieved a blessing of Jousenkyo? Well, it's a blessing allright! I've been made fun of for a little too long! Hmm, but I don't under stand. That water wasn't cold... oh well! Now guys will like me! AND! I DONT TURN INTO A MONKEY ANYMORE! But my family won't recognise me. It will be kind of weird not being able to change back to my original body. Well I think they'll believe me. After all They believe the jousenkyo curse right? I'll tell them I got cured and this is what happend. Ha now I can laugh at Ling Su! I'm hotter than her!"<p>This girl, whoever she was, was very happy with her new blessing.<p>1000 years later...<p>"JEEZ AKANE! WHAT'JA DO THAT FOR!" Ranma shouted. It was not his day, today and, even if it was, it probably wouldn't matter. After being hit on the head three times with a mallet before school he knew it was going to be a bad day.<p>"I just wish I knew why she's so mad all the time! I've known her for three years! Hell, we almost got married once! And I woulda said yes!"<p>This is how things had gone on since the failed wedding. The same. It was all the same! Nothing really different ever happened. Ranma would be challenged, Ranma would win. One of the fiancees would be kidnapped, Ranma would save them. Ranma would take a beating every day from something or another. Ranma wanted something new to happen. Well, something new was about to happen.<p>"YOU SKIPPED OUT ON MY BREAKFAST THIS MORNING!" Akane screamed.<p>"If you call that breakfast!" Ranma returned.<p>"Grrrr," Akane growled with a orange aura around her.<p>"Hey look Akane, I'll, make it up tonight! I promise tonight I'll eat your horse manuer... I... I MEAN DINNER!" Ranma covered.<p>Of course Akane noticed Ranma's error and smashed him to leo with the mallet of doom. Then she went inside, threw on her gi, and went to break some bricks. Ranma meanwhile, was counting his money and guessing how much it would take to get home.<p>"135 yen... Well, I'm walkin it!" Ranma thought as he flew ever higher into the stratusphere.<p>"Huh, HONESTLY! SKIPPING OUT OF EATING SOMETHING I WORKED SO HARD TO MAKE!  HE MAKES ME SO MAD! ARRGGGG!" Akane screamed.<p>Anyone watching what was going on in the dojo would feel sorry for the bricks...<p>It began to rain. "Oh my, I had best get some water hot for Ranma," Kasumi thought. She began boiling the water.<p>About an hour later Ranma walked in.<p>"Oh Ranma here's some water for you," Kasumi said greeting Ranma at the front porch near the table.<p>As Ranma was about to take the water however, a voice was heard calling out from the front gate.<p>"RANMA PREPARE TO DIE!"<p>"Ryoga I don't have time for you!" Ranma returned.<p>Ryoga was holding his umbrella so he didn't get wet from the rain.<p>"Running away again are you? Fight me Ranma!" Ryoga said as he charged and led Ranma outside. Ranma place down the pot since he would get wet anway.<p>Outside Ranma's inevitable victory was occuring. But inside is where the real interesting thing is. Kasumi was about to get the pot and put it back on the boiler so it would stay hot. But just then she smelled smoke. "OH NO! I HOPE IT"S NOT BURNT!" She cried as she ran to the kitchen.<p>Ryoga was now somewhere on the opposite side of the world courtesy of a very annoyed Ranma. Ranma walked inside and picked up the kettle by the handle just as Kasumi walked in.<p>"Oh, Ranma that's not ho..." She stopped.<p>When Ranma poured the water on his head, something wrong happened. Ranma began to glow. His (still her at the moment) entire body began to emit a white light. It became so bright that Kasumi couldn't see and had to shield her eyes.<p>"What's goin' on!" Ranma shouted.<p>Meanwhile Akane was too angry to notice the white light. Soun and Genma were out getting drunk somewhere. Nabiki had gone to collage, and happosai could care less if the boy was shouting, even if he was a she at the moment, so the only one who saw this was Kasumi.<p>Ranma was slowly rising into the air. "KASUMI, WHAT IS THIS?" Ranma screamed.<p>"I don't know Ranma!" Kasumi said unusually uncalm.<p>The light died down. It became odd. It was a blueish light that surrounded Ranma leaving her out line clearly visible. A little too visible since it looked very much like Sailor moon transforming. (Just a reference. This fic has no connection with sailor moon! Don't worry!) Ranma's eyes snapped shut. She spun slowly in the air as her hands crossed her chest. Kasumi notice changes in Ranma's appearance. She grew about six inches taller. The outline of her hair grew. The pigtail snapped off letting Ranma's hair fall almost to her feet. Ranma's eyes were closed but she was aware that something very unusual was happening and no matter how hard she tried, she could not open her eyes. Her chest stayed about the same but shifted a little along with her form becoming a tad bit thinner.<p>Kasumi was amazed. When the whole transformation was done Ranma fell down to the floor breathing hard. But... It wasn't Ranma. In place of Ranma was a goddess on earth. Her hair was blond and long and abnormally shinny and clean. (Her hair is the same hairdo from Nihou my concubine, The Second movie, only it's blonde) Her eyes, once blue, were now a pale green that matched with the beautiful marble gemstones that now were hanging from her newly pierced ears. She wore a white dress with a green sash at the middle. The only other difference was that the mark of a small dragon now lay, embedded in the girls forhead. All in all, she was still recognisable as Ranma. But most would think it was a disguise. A very good one.<p>"Oh...Oh my," Kasumi said.<p>"Damn," Ranma said standing up.<p>"Ranma, is that you?" Kasumi asked.<p>"Yes," Ranma replied.<p>"What happened?"<p>"I don't know. As I felt myself changing, I heard a voice that said, "You have recieved the blessing of Jousenkyo. Your appearance is your heart's reflection,"" Ranma told her.<p>"Kasumi, do you have hot water?"<p>"Yes, here," Kasumi replied after going to the kitchen.<p>Ranma poured it on himself but nothing happened.<p>"NNNNNOOOOOOOOO DAMNIT!" Ranma shouted.<p>"Ranma, I..." Kasumi was at a loss for words. It was her fault what had happened to Ranma. If she had only put the water on the boiler... Then he would have changed back into a man, and none of this would'be happened.<p>"Kasumi," Ranma said coming out of his rage, "Tell, no one. Never tell. I'm going to find a cure,"<p>"Why don't you ask Cologne or happo..." She was interupted.<p>"No, If I ask anyone her about this they will blackmail me into doing something I don't want to. I'm going. I'll keep in touch with you Kasumi,"<p>"Are you sure?" Kasumi asked. "Don't go Ranma. We need you here!"<p>"Need me? I was planning on going soon anyway. Now I have a very good reason too," Ranma replied.<p>"You would run away from all your problems? Just because you became a girl? If your going to find a cure anywhere Ranma, it's right here in Nerima," Kasumi said.<p>"That won't work on me. I'm not running from my problems. I'm fixing them. The jousenkyo curse is a problem I plan to fix,"<p>"Ranma..."<p>Ranma had walked up to his room. About fifteen minutes later he came downstairs with a pack and all his belongings, a tent, and a flashlight, incase he needed it.<p>"Ranma, you don't have to go..." Kasumi said in one last vain attempt to get him to stay, "I don't want you to have to go back to china because of my mistake! I'll go and find you a cure!"<p>Ranma smiled. "Kasumi, it's not your fault. You would never purposely hurt anyone! I'll be fine. I can't stay a girl. I gotta be a guy again. I hate gettin' stuck in my girl form more than I hate happosai! I'll find a cure,"<p>"Ranma, I... I'm sorry,"<p>"Kasumi," Ranma said. But he was interupted by someone coming from the dojo.<p>"Bye Kasumi,"<p>"Goodbye Ranma," She said as he walked out the door. A tear slid down her face. "I'm sorry,"<p>"Kasumi? What's wrong? Where's Ranma?" Akane asked.<p>Kasumi quickly wiped away her tears and replied, "Nothing's wrong Akane, and Ranma still hasn't come back yet,"<p>"UGH THAT IDIOT! HE'S PROBABLY AT SHAMPOO OR UKYO'S!" Akane cried.<p>"Now, Akane that's not..." But Akane was already gone back to the dojo.<p>************************<p>Ranma was running toward the beach. Toward the sea of Japan. She loved the sea and couldn't wait to see it again. She figured if he was gone from home he might as well have fun even though she did have to be a girl most the time. She would go surfing for a while and then start the swim. She had no other way of getting to China. She didn't have any idea what would be waiting for her there. After all since she had no swim suit she decieded she would surf in her shorts and shirt out fit. This, and the fact that she was now a goddess no matter what she wore, attracted members of the opposite sex to her like a magnet to metal.<p>"Hey, I...!PMFH! WHOA!" A boy flew back against the wall.<p>"Huh, I guess I can't go surfing. Not with all these perverted creeps watchin' me!<p>Ranma climed out of the water and put on her wrist bracers. "I guess it's time to go back to China," She thought as she ran into the water where she expected to be for about 2 days.
