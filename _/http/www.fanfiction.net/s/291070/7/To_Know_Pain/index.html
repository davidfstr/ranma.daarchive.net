</div><p>"…ma?" Ranma opened his eyes to see Kasumi sitting over him, holding a small porcelain bowl and a washcloth. "Good morning, Ranma. I'm here to help wash your face, okay? So try to hold still." Her trembling lips pressed into a smile and she brought the damp cloth toward Ranma's face.</p><p>He jerked his head away, but it was too late. The water dripped onto his forehead – make that <i>her</i> forehead – and she could feel the change wash over her. Kasumi yelped and dropped the bowl to shatter on the floor, startled both by Ranma's transformation and his reaction.  "Oh, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot…"</p><p>Something was wrong with Ranma. Or something was right. She'd changed, she realized that, but the bandages in her mouth, on her skin, weren't hiding anything anymore. Weren't hiding anything? The pain was gone.  <i>The pain is gone. What did you do to me, Kasumi?</i></p><p>"Do you need me to get you anything? I'm so sorry!" The older girl busied herself cleaning up the bits of porcelain, mumbling to keep herself from thinking about anything. "Here, let me just get this cleaned up and I'll get you some hot water, okay? You don't need to wash your face, it'll be all right, I promise. Oh, I'm so clumsy, I'm sorry, you just startled me. Not that it's your fault, it's my fault, but…"</p><p>Ranma wished that Kasumi would just shut up. He was trying to think. How… what happened? His tongue felt fine. His skin felt fine. His strength was back. <i>My strength is back?</i> Restraints groaned, then snapped. Kasumi's yelp was followed by a gasp of amazement as Ranma ripped the restraints off of his mouth, the bandages off of his tongue. There were no contusions. There was no trace of any wound.</p><p>Eyes wide, Kasumi could do nothing but watch as the young girl removed her bandages with trembling hands. There… nothing. There was nothing. This was impossible.</p><p>Dr. Tofu threw open the door and gasped. "Ranma, how…" He trailed off into open-mouthed amazement. The scars on Ranma's body were the only signs of trauma. Even by magical standards, this was amazing.  Thoughts raced through his head so quickly that he didn't even realize he was speaking aloud. "Amazing! The Jusenkyo curse must…. It <i>must</i> be the curse! The original curse was of a girl, yes? Yes, yes. A girl in perfect health. It must be that the curse is an exact replication of the original body. Perfectly healthy... So anything that happens to male Ranma – Yes! – anything that happens to male Ranma can be reversed by activating the curse! Amazing! Amazing!"</p><p>Smooth skin met bumpy scars, but they were normal. As normal as Ranma got. Nothing was wrong. Had Dr. Tofu spoken? The curse saved him? What? <i>How?</i>  Astonished, she continued to remove the bandages, forgetting for a moment that she was letting her scars be seen.</p><p>Ranma had calmed down enough to bathe – under strict supervision by Dr. Tofu, of course – and dress. He was still in shock. Everyone was, but Kasumi and Dr. Tofu were in pleasant shock. Ranma was in dismayed shock.</p><p>'So what you're telling me, Dr. Tofu,' Ranma had written, 'is that if I had been cursed when I received the Neko-Ken training, I would have been fine?' Tofu smiled and nodded, completely absorbed in this new discovery.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Still didn't solve the problem of his scars, but at least he had something else to be depressed about.</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p><p>Kasumi sat down across from Ranma at the small table, set down a cup of tea. "I'm glad to see that you're feeling better, Ranma." She smiled sweetly and Ranma had to look away. <i>You don't deserve that, Ranma. Besides, she's just lying to you again.</i></p><p>Tofu nodded, sipping his own tea. "It's amazing, it really is. This could mean a lot of different things for you, young man." Ranma snorted.  "No, really! You can heal from any wound! Well, I would imagine there are some limits, but still! Isn't this exciting to you?"  The young man shook his head solemnly, then reached for a pen.  'Means it'll be harder for me to disappear.'</p><p>"Oh, Ranma, why would you say such things?" Kasumi was angry. "We all care for you, and you keep saying things like that? Stop being so selfish!"</p><p>"Now, Kasumi…" started the Doctor, but Ranma interrupted them both by slamming his hands down on the table. His tea cup fell over, spilling the hot liquid to pool around his hands.</p><p>Ranma's heart hardened in that moment, and he made a decision.</p><p><i>Good.</i></p><p>Heavy breathing formed the ambient noise in that room for a full half-minute before Ranma stood up and looked straight into Kasumi's eyes.</p><p>Then he had to look away to find a pen and some dry paper. <i>Way to kill the mood, Body</i>. Ranma snorted to himself.</p><p>'That's not what I meant. Not anymore. I'm through running like that.  Running only means that I leave myself open to attack, that I'm vulnerable – even to three untrained thugs who want to <i>rape me.</i>'  The pen broke in half, but Ranma barely noticed. He picked up the front end and continued writing. 'So that's it, no more running.  But I'm also through accepting help from people – people like you. So, whatever your reasons for helping me, thanks, I guess. But I'm leaving. I do not belong in your happy world of high school and friends. I need to go and get this curse lifted, and I need to live by myself, far away from everyone else, to perfect my martial arts. That's the only way I'm going to be happy – by being completely alone.'</p><p>"That's running, too!" Akane's voice came from behind Ranma, startling him and making him whirl around into a battle stance. The girl's face was flushed from running, but her eyes were concerned as they moved from the paper to his face. "That's running away just as surely as killing yourself!"</p><p>Ranma shrugged, wrote, 'Well at least it's better than getting hurt every time I meet someone new. I can't get rejected by people like you if I never meet them.'</p><p>Akane's battle aura flared. "You jerk, who the hell do you think you are? Reject you? All I've been doing since I met you is worrying about you!"</p><p>'I don't want your pity.'</p><p>"PITY?" The punch came swiftly, catching Ranma in the stomach and causing him to crumple like a tin can. "Ranma, I don't know how Dr. Tofu cured you so quickly, but so help me if you keep putting words into my mouth, I'll put you right back into that hospital bed." Ranma coughed silently and looked up, but Akane ploughed forward. "I don't pity you! Well, okay," she corrected herself, "maybe I do a little. But that's not why I'm helping you. I'm helping you because, like it or not, you're a friend of the family. Your father and my father are friends, and that means I have an obligation to help you."</p><p>'Ah.' Ranma smirked. 'So you're only helping me because of Father?'</p><p>A shamed blush crept onto the girl's face as she replied. "No, that's not all of it. I… thought that maybe we could be friends, too, you know?"</p><p>Ranma scribbled some more, handed the paper to Akane. 'Listen, don't lie to yourself. The only reason you're doing any of this is because you feel sorry for me. You think it's crazy that my father would tie cat food to my body and throw me in a pit – that disgusts you. You think it's sad, and you want to help. I get that. But don't, for my sake and for yours, don't read too much into that feeling.  It's pity. And I don't want it.'</p><p>"What's he writing, Akane?" Kasumi sounded worried.</p><p>"So the hell what?" Akane let a tear slide down her face as she raged at the scarred boy in front of her. "So what if it is? So what if I'm a bad person for pitying you? Everyone has something to be ashamed of, Ranma, even you! You're a jerk! You're selfish! All we've been doing – all of us," she gestured to Kasumi and the Doctor, "- is trying to help you! It shouldn't matter why, it should just matter that we are!"</p><p>Dr. Tofu was the first to catch on to the half-conversation he'd been hearing.  "Ranma, people do things for different reasons. Pity, love, just plain kindness – all of these things drive human action. But to oversimplify those actions based solely on their driving force does the person an injustice. Pity by itself is neutral – pity and kindness mean help, pity and hostility mean derision." Ranma shook his head, but Tofu forestalled any further reaction. "I am helping you because I think you need help. If you refuse my help, I will stop. But please don't think I'm doing it for myself, to satiate some 'pity-rule' in my life. I'm doing it for you."</p><p>Kasumi and Akane nodded. But Ranma just snorted. <i>Shit. I don't care. Don't help me, I don't deserve it. I'm useless, all I do is cause trouble, and you should just leave me the hell alone. Why the fuck don't you people take a hint? I hate myself! By helping me, you're hurting me!</i> Tears threatened to overflow, but the boy squeezed them back. <i>No. Pity is not something that can be used for good. Pity is a despicable thing. Live your whole life under the influence of pity, then come to speak to me of its neutrality.  Pity. Pfaugh. I've no use for it. </i>Ranma wrote a single word on his paper and laid it on the table. 'Goodbye.'</p><p>Akane's rage exploded again. "Fine! You jackass! If you're going to be a stubborn jerk about it, then leave! And to think I came all this way to tell you that Ryoga is-" Ranma moved so quickly that no one even had a chance to react. His fist bunched the front of Akane's blouse, his face scant centimeters from hers. The question in his eyes was plain enough. "Yes, Ranma, your friend Ryoga is here. He came to school looking for you, so Nabiki and I offered to lead him here." Ranma's head was reeling. He had to sit down. <i>Ryoga?  Here?</i> "I ran ahead to tell you the good news, but the two of them should be here any minute."</p><p><i>Any minute.</i>  Thoughts rushed through his head, enough to drown out the questions from Kasumi and the Doctor. <i>Any minute? What is Ryoga doing here? How did he find me? WHY did he find me? Any minute…</i>.  <i>Will we fight? Of course we'll fight. Will I fight back this time? If I do, will I hurt him? Can I control myself enough to just knock him out, so I can escape?</i> Ranma's hands trembled as they rose to cover his face. <i>No. No, I can't. I don't. He'll be here any minute, and I'll hurt him, maybe kill him, and I'll go to jail – for real this time – and that will be that. Deep breaths. Deep, calming breaths. I have to get out of here. What happened to those perverts from the other night? NO! I hope they're dead. They deserve it. So do I, but that's neither here nor there. Ryoga. Here. Shit.</i></p><p>Ranma stood just as the door opened behind Akane, to admit Nabiki and a fanged youth.</p><p>Ryoga smiled.</p><p>"Ranma! Prepare to die!" That voice tickled the back of Genma's memory. Did he know that voice? From where…?</p><p>A loud explosion rocked the neighborhood, and Ryoga landed in front of the two friends on the street. Ranma, clad in his regular black shirt and pants, landed softly in front of the three.</p><p>Fangs glinted in another smile. "Good to see that you've not forgotten me."  Picking himself up slowly, the new boy dusted off his pants. "You know, Ranma, I've been following you ever since you ran out on our duel."</p><p>"Ryoga! Ryoga Hibiki!" Genma smiled and snapped his fingers. "Now I remember you! But I thought you and Ranma were friends."</p><p>Ranma shook his head. Ryoga just laughed. "Hardly. This freak has no business existing, let alone being my friend." An accusatory finger flew at Ranma. "You ran out on our duel, Ranma, and I've been trying to catch you ever since. My travels have brought me all over the world – even to Jusenkyo." Ranma's eyes widened. "Yes, I followed you to China. And I bear a curse of my own now, thanks to you!"  Dr. Tofu and the three Tendo sisters arrived at the scene, worried frowns on each face. "I'm a freak like you, now, Ranma! And you'll pay for that! Prepare to die!"</p><p>Ryoga charged, and Kasumi yelled "No!"</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Ranma sidestepped the blow, grabbed Ryoga's outstretched arm, and applied just enough force at the elbow to break it.</p><p>"NO!" yelled Kasumi again. Genma looked on with pride in his eyes. The rest just stared.</p><p>"DAMN YOU RANMA!"  Ryoga heaved himself to his feet and came again. Ranma broke the boy's other arm. Murder in his eyes, Ryoga leveled a desperate kick at Ranma's head. That appendage broke just as easily.</p><p>"Ranma, stop!"  Akane and Nabiki yelled at the same time.</p><p>Genma yelled "That's my boy! Unbeatable in combat!"</p><p><i>This man is responsible for a lifetime's allotment of pain.</i> Ranma advanced a step, no expression on his face. <i>He turned the entire school against you.</i> Another step, and a smile crept onto his face. <i>And now he's at your mercy, Ranma. You can end his life just as easily as you've broken his limbs.</i> A silent laugh, another step. <i>Do it.</i> "Don't do it!" yelled Kasumi, tears streaming down her face. <i>Do it.</i> Another step. Dr. Tofu started running toward the pair of boys, but knew he'd never make it in time. "Do it," gasped Ryoga through the pain. "I couldn't stand living if I lost to a freak like you." <i>Do it now.</i> The final step. <i>DO IT.</i> "Ranma, don't do it!" Genma finally realized what was about to happen, and he didn't want his son in jail.</p><p><i>KILL HIM!</i></p><p>"I can't be friends with a murderer!"</p><p>Akane's shout stopped the blow just long enough for Tofu to reach the quarreling boys. Two swift taps to Ranma's neck and he slumped to the ground, asleep.</p><p>Ryoga just growled, "NO! Why did you stop him? This was a fight between men!" Two more taps, and the bleeding boy was silenced.</p><p>Akane ran over to Dr. Tofu and hugged him unabashedly. Nabiki fainted, but Kasumi managed to catch her before she hit the ground. Genma and Soun just looked at each other askance.</p><p>Ryoga woke up in a hospital bed. "Wha…?" He sat up, saw no one was in the room, and looked down at his legs. They were both fine. "What? How…?"</p><p>Dr. Tofu cracked the door and peeked his head in. "Ah, Ryoga. Good to see you're awake."</p><p>"You're the one who stopped the fight!" He shook his head. "Never mind. How am I all right? He broke my arms and legs!"</p><p>The Doctor smiled and stepped the rest of his body into the room. "Ah, that's just one of the side effects of your curse, Ryoga. If you get hurt, you can just trigger the curse to heal yourself."</p><p>A slow smile crept onto his face, revealing his trademark fangs. "Really? That's… useful."</p><p>"Incidentally," remarked Tofu casually, the smile disappearing from his face, "if you try to attack Ranma again, I will be forced to stop you. I'm not unskilled in the martial arts, myself."</p><p>"Oh, don't worry about that," chuckled Ryoga as he stood up. He noticed the pile of his clothes on a nearby chair and started dressing. "I now realize that I'm no match for Ranma. I've got more training to do before I come back and try to kill him again."</p><p>A prominent scowl graced the doctor's face. "Saying something like that, do you really think I can let you leave here?"</p><p>More laughter, then silence as Ryoga finished dressing. He turned toward the doorway and smiled, fastening his bandana across his brow. "You can keep the pack. I'll just get another one." And he jumped out the window before Dr. Tofu could react.</p><p>When Tofu reached the window, it was too late. There was no sign of Ryoga Hibiki.</p><p>Ranma woke in much the same way, staring at a blank hospital ceiling. <i>This is getting to be a habit.</i> He chuckled to himself. <i>God I'm useless</i>.</p><p>He, however, was not alone. The three Tendo sisters sat beside the bed, talking quietly amongst themselves. Ranma took the opportunity to eavesdrop and closed his eyes again. <i>I may as well act the degenerate asshole.  That's what I am.</i></p><p>"…I don't need your forgiveness," Nabiki was saying to her sisters. "I could never deserve it anyway. What I need is the opportunity to help Ranma, in any way I can." <i>You three are cut from the same cloth, all right. I don't want your help!</i></p><p>Kasumi replied in a heated tone, "How do you think I can allow you near him after learning what you did? You profited off of his disfigurement, Nabiki!" <i>That's good to know. Nabiki is an enemy.</i></p><p>"I know!"  Nabiki's exclamation was almost a cry. "I know, okay? I'm not proud of it. I'm going to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life." <i>I don't buy it. You're my enemy now, Nabiki, now and forever.</i> "What I'm trying to do is make up for the hurt I've caused him." <i>Fat chance.</i> "I know there's no chance of that, but I've got to try. I owe him that much, at least."</p><p>"He doesn't want your pity, you know." Akane spoke softly. <i>Finally, someone understands.</i></p><p>"I don't care!  I'm going to help him whether he likes it or not. Whether you like it or not, too."</p><p>Kasumi was quiet for a moment before responding. "Nabiki, you're my sister and I love you. I… don't know if I can forgive you for what you've done to this young man, but I'll always love you. And if you are truly determined to help Ranma, then that's good enough for me." Ranma thought he could <i>hear</i> Kasumi smile. "I will welcome your help."</p><p>Akane spoke again.  "You two don't get it, do you? He's hurt. He's… damaged goods." <i>Got that right.</i> "He'll only see your help as a burden to bear. He doesn't want a mother, Kasumi, or a pity-party, Nabiki. What he wants – what he needs – is a friend."</p><p>…</p><p>"I hope to be that friend." Akane leaned over and brushed the hair out of Ranma's face. The boy reacted without thinking, grabbing her hand and sitting bolt-upright in bed. "Oh!" Akane gasped, startled.  "You're awake, Ranma? How… how much did you hear?" She extricated her hand from his grip and blushed faintly.</p><p>Ranma's gaze shifted from Akane to Nabiki. He scowled and raised a single finger in her direction, eliciting gasps from the sisters. He then reached over to the paper and pen sitting beside the bed - <i>I hate how they're already used to my deformity</i> – and wrote a sentence to Nabiki: 'Leave me alone forever.'</p><p>Nabiki bowed her head. She stayed that way for a second, then raised her head and spoke, a pair of tears trickling down her face. "No. I'm never going to be able to atone for my sins, but my life is yours nonetheless. Anything you want – anything you need – you will get from me. Whether you like it or not." Her eyes held the too-familiar pity, and determination.</p><p>Disgusted, Ranma turned back to Akane. The raven-haired girl was looking at him with – no, not pity – genuine affection in her eyes? <i>Is that what that looks like?</i> Her soft skin held the faintest tinge of pink, and her face was perfectly framed by her long hair. <i>She really is cute, even if she is nuttier than a fruitcake</i>.</p><p>"Ranma, I know Nabiki well enough to realize that she truly regrets her actions."  When Ranma turned his head back toward the eldest Tendo sister, the sun shone in through the window and illuminated her long, brown hair so… beautifully that he had to look away. "You don't have to forgive her, but at least allow her to try and help you."</p><p><i>What is going on here?</i> Ranma's face was getting hot, and he started to fidget nervously. He looked back to Nabiki, who was still red-eyed, but staring at him resolutely. Her strong features and short-cropped hair lent her an air of authority, of strength. <i>Oh, you've got to be kidding me.</i></p><p>A deep breath preceded another note. 'I'm leaving tomorrow. Don't try and follow me.'</p><p>Akane read the note and forestalled any comments by her sisters with a raised hand.  "Fine, Ranma, if that's what you want." The other three people in the room looked at her with astonishment. "But I want to make a proposition, first." <i>…What is going on here?</i> The pen moved quickly, but Akane's hand was quicker. "No, Ranma, let me speak my piece."</p><p>"Akane-" started Kasumi, but again she raised her hand in a command for silence.</p><p>"In a minute, big sister. Ranma," she turned back to him, "we kind of got off on the wrong foot. I know it's mostly my fault, but some of it was yours, too." Ranma bristled at that comment. "So what I'm proposing is we start over. No pity from me, no hostility from you.  Erase and start again. Maybe we can be friends this time?"</p><p>Ranma's mind raced. <i>This… this girl is lying to you again, Ranma. She's just doing this because she feels sorry for you. Another girl feels pity for you.</i></p><p><i>But what if it's not? What if… what if I can actually get a friend from this?</i></p><p><i>Idiot! Isn't that what Ryoga said at first? And look what just happened!</i></p><p><i>Ryoga! Where is he?</i> Ranma tried to stand, but Akane's hand on his chest forestalled him. "No, Ranma, not until I get an answer."</p><p>Akane's hand warmed Ranma's chest. He blushed again. <i>Is… is this for real?</i></p><p><i>Am I dreaming? </i></p><p>The look in Akane's eyes suggested that it was the real deal.</p><p><i>NO! She's a liar and a cheat! She told the whole school about you!</i></p><p><i>That was Nabiki.  She said so herself. Akane… maybe she really wants to be friends?</i></p><p><i>She saw your scars! She knows you're dirty! She knows you tried to kill yourself!</i></p><p><i>I NEVER! It was an accident! I just had to get the dirt... I'm so dirty…</i></p><p><i>Yes, you are.  You're a dirty little insect. You don't deserve these people in your life.</i></p><p>…<i>But what if you're wrong?</i></p><p><i>I'm not. I'm always right.</i></p><p><i>No, you're not.  You're me. I'm always wrong, which means you're always wrong.</i></p><p><i>That's a backwards way of looking at things.</i></p><p><i>Shut up! I'm always wrong! I'm useless, worthless. That means that these people, these girls here, are the ones who have worth, who are right.</i></p><p><i>No!</i></p><p><i>Which means that I… I must be worth something?</i></p><p><i>NO! You're a dried-up husk of a human being.</i></p><p><i>But I was human once! Maybe I can be human again!</i></p><p><i>You're a monster, and worthless to boot! You deserve death!</i></p><p><i>NO! I'm done listening to you! Go away!</i></p><p><i>I AM you, you said so yourself! You can never be rid of me!</i></p><p><i>I'm done with you! From now on, I'm going to try to live my life! I'm going to try to be a good person, to exist in the world that shuns me! I'm going to grow, get better than the rotten world that spawned me, and I will win! I will not let this pathetic life beat me, and I will not let you stop me!</i></p><p>Ranma grabbed his head and screamed silently to himself, <i>I can make my life better!</i></p><p>Ranma Saotome panted heavily, still clutching his head in his hands.</p><p>He feebly reached for his pen and paper.</p><p>'Perhaps we <u>can</u> start over.</p><p>I'm Ranma Saotome.  Nice to meet you.'</p><p>Mmmmmmmmmmyep.</p>
