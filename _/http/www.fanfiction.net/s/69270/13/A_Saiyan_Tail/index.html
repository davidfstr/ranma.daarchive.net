</div>A Saiyan Tail<p>Part 24<p>The Sacred Waters of Jusenkyo.<p>++++++++++<p>Akane sat in the bath; it had been two days since the incident at<br/>the beach. The water was steaming hot, and filled the bathroom with a<br/>thick steam. She frowned and looked around for a moment. "Still not<br/>enough." A moment later her aura flared to life, soon the water was<br/>boiling and she relaxed a bit. "Ahh, much better."<p>A moment later the door to the room slid open, followed by a<br/>screech of surprise. "Oh my!" said Kasumi as she entered the room for<br/>a moment, and then backed out again.<p>"Huh? Kasumi?" muttered Akane in surprise. She stepped out of the<br/>furo and wrapped a towel around her waist. "What's wrong?"<p>"Akane! Are you all right?" said the older girl with concern on<br/>her face as she looked at the steam cloud that was billowing out of<br/>the room. "You're not burned are you? I'll have to call the plumber<br/>and get the hot water fixed!"<p>"Huh? I suppose, it isn't very hot anymore," said Akane as she<br/>began to get dressed.<p>Kasumi blinked and looked at her younger sister in surprise. "Are<br/>you feeling all right Akane?"<p>"Of course, why?" said the younger girl obliviously. "If you want<br/>to take a bath, I'm done now."<p>Kasumi looked at the steam filled room and then back to her sister<br/>again. "Oh my. I think I'll wait a little while."<p>++++++++++<p>"But...why?" said Akane in confusion as she looked at the entire<br/>household. They were sitting around the table in a meeting of sorts.<p>"Akane, your training didn't go away when you were cured of the<br/>Cat's tongue. You should be the last one to take a bath from now on,"<br/>said Ranma with a small frown on his face.<p>"What do you mean?" said the girl as she tried to understand what<br/>they were talking about.<p>"We mean, that the rest of us can't sit in boiling water like you<br/>can," said Soun. "I understand Akane, but it's just easier to deal<br/>with this way. You will be the last one to bathe from now on. Unless<br/>you stop boiling the furo when you get in."<p>"Oh," muttered the girl in embarrassment. "I understand, I guess."<p>"Don't be upset, Akane," said Kasumi sweetly. "We aren't mad at<br/>you."<p>"Thank you, Kasumi. I'll try to be more careful from now on," said<br/>the girl with a small bow to her family.<p>"That's all we're asking," said Soun cheerfully. "I am pleased<br/>with your progress Akane, you've done very well."<p>"Um, thanks," said the girl with a slight blush forming on her<br/>face.<p>"Yeah, maybe we should go see Master Roshi one of these days?"<br/>offered Goku with a grin. "I'm sure he'd offer a few tips for you."<p>"Hey! That's a good idea!" agreed Ranma.<p>"I'm not so sure..." muttered Soun with a slight frown. After all,<br/>both of his old masters were rooming together now. Sending Akane to<br/>visit them both didn't sit well with him.<p>"I'd love to meet them!" said Akane excitedly.<p>"Maybe this weekend would be a good time?" offered Goku.<p>"Great!" exclaimed Akane as she stood up. It was a Sunday, and the<br/>seasonal break had just ended. Meaning they had school for the rest of<br/>the week.<p>++++++++++++<p>"I said I don't want you here this evening Shampoo," said Cologne<br/>calmly. "This isn't a good place for young girls to be today."<p>"Aiya! What Great Grandmother talking?" exclaimed the girl<br/>irritably.<p>"We're having some visitors today. It's Amazon business, why don't<br/>you go out and try to find your husband?" Cologne smiled at her.<p>Shampoo shifted uncomfortably at this, the old woman had told her<br/>that the boy and girl versions of her Ranma, were in fact the same<br/>person. Apparently, she had picked up a curse, from a place called<br/>Jusenkyo, while in China.<p>Mousse growled at this announcement, but returned to cleaning<br/>tables.<p>"Yes Great Grandmother!" she said while putting on a cheerful<br/>smile. Secretly, she had no intention of crossing Akane Tendo, despite<br/>having mastered the Katsutenshin Amaguriken, she knew the girl was<br/>much more powerful than she was. The fight would be short, and end in<br/>her defeat without a doubt at the moment.<p>Cologne snorted in disgust. "You don't fool me for a moment<br/>child."<p>Shampoo frowned at the hag irritably. "Shampoo not stupid enough<br/>challenge Turtle Shell Girl. She wait until much stronger first, then<br/>fight when know win."<p>"A very good idea," agreed Cologne. She actually looked impressed<br/>with her Great Granddaughter. "It seems you are learning after all<br/>child. Go and visit anyway, you'll be safer there, and it will help if<br/>you are on good terms with the Son in Law."<p>"Yes, Great Grandmother," said Shampoo as she bowed and stood up.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Stay close," said a cloaked figure that walked through the<br/>streets of Nerima. Beside him were two young boys in their mid-teens.<br/>One was dressed in a cloak of wolf skin, while the other wore garments<br/>fashioned from a tiger.<p>"Lord Herb, do you think we'll get to meet any girls?" said the<br/>wolf-skinned boy.<p>"We aren't here for that, Mint," snapped the cloaked figure<br/>angrily.<p>"But if we should happen to find some?" said the tiger-skinned boy<br/>hopefully.<p>The man in the cloak sighed. "Fine, you can go off and look around<br/>a bit, but we aren't here to find wives. Our mission is more important<br/>than that. Don't forget it Lime."<p>The tiger boy got a huge grin on his face. "Yes sir!"<p>"Idiots," muttered Herb as he watched them jump away happily.<p>++++++++<p>"I don't like this, Shampoo," said Mousse as he walked beside the<br/>young Amazon, she was riding along lazily beside him on her bike.<p>"Shampoo not like either. Boy much too strong, Great Grandmother<br/>not understand this," agreed the purple haired Amazon with a frown.<br/>"It do no good, and Shampoo not strong enough to beat Turtle Shell<br/>Girl. Even if Shampoo could, it not make Ranma happy."<p>Mousse looked at her for a moment in surprise. The trip to Japan<br/>had done quite a bit for her humility, and her pride. She had also<br/>grown more careful, and it showed dramatically in her actions. "Hmm, I<br/>don't know what's wrong with that guy. How could he pick a woman like<br/>that over you?"<p>"Mousse not get anywhere with flattery. Shampoo still say no,"<br/>snorted the girl as she glanced back at him for a moment.<p>"Darn," grumbled the boy irritably.<p>A shadowy figure stood on the wall above them for a moment. Mousse<br/>turned in surprise and forced Shampoo out of the way. Well, he tried<br/>too. He ended up saving her bike instead. A large net landed on the<br/>ground where they had been standing moments before.<p>"Shampoo! Have you lost weight?" cried the boy as he hefted the<br/>bike up protectively.<p>"How long you being stupid, Mousse?" snapped Shampoo angrily.<p>Mint jumped down in front of Shampoo, holding a large mallet in<br/>his grip. He was slowly edging towards her. "Um, if it's not too much<br/>trouble, would you mind going on a date with me?"<p>Shampoo paused, staring at the boy for a moment. "Boy action not<br/>match words," she said pointedly.<p>"What? Who are you?" snapped Mousse as he jumped up in front of<br/>his beloved. "You're a hundred years to young to date with her!"<p>"If you're going to interfere," said the boy in a warning tone. He<br/>vanished from in front of Mousse, and appeared behind him in an<br/>instant. "Ro Ga Ryusei Dan!" Dozens of small knives shot towards<br/>Mousse from behind as the boy attacked.<p>"Mousse!" exclaimed Shampoo in alarm.<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane was walking home from school. Ranma, having decided that he<br/>was hungry, decided to stop by his old friend Ukyo's restaurant. She<br/>didn't like that one bit, but said nothing. At least the girl's father<br/>was there to keep an eye on things.<p>Without warning, the wall beside her buckled suddenly, shattering<br/>inward, leaving a cloud of dust and rubble. The girl raised her<br/>eyebrow slightly at the figure that stepped out of the debris.<p>"You! Are you a girl?" said Lime as he glared at her for a moment.<p>"What else would I be?" snorted Akane in annoyance.<p>"This is the first time in my life that I've spoken with a girl!"<br/>said the tiger boy to no one.<p>"Um, excuse me..." said Akane in confusion.<p>"I will try touching a girl now!" said the boy as he turned to<br/>face her.<p>"What?" said the girl in shock as she backed away for a moment.<br/>She put up her fists and growled at the boy. "Keep your hands to<br/>yourself!"<p>Lime paused and looked at her in shock. "But...I just want to see<br/>what it's like..."<p>"So do a lot of people, but that's not how you ask a girl out,"<br/>said a new voice. Ryoga floated down from the air, and landed opposite<br/>the stranger.<p>Lime glared at the boy for a moment. "Don't interfere! This is a<br/>special moment for me! It's my first time talking with a girl!"<p>"I don't need your help," said Akane with a small frown.<p>"I'm not doing this to help you. I've been watching this idiot for<br/>a while now. What if he had happened upon some poor innocent girl, who<br/>couldn't take care of herself?"<p>Akane paused for a moment, and nodded. "Right, but he didn't, so<br/>you can leave now."<p>"I think not, this one has a powerful aura. He's more than you can<br/>handle," said Ryoga calmly. "You go on, I'll deal with this fool."<p>"Jerk! I don't need you to protect me! You murdering bastard!"<br/>snapped Akane angrily as her aura flared to life.<p>"Um, excuse me..." muttered Lime as he stared at the two arguing<br/>teens for a moment. He stopped when he noticed the tail waving behind<br/>Ryoga's back. "He's... is he Musk too? Could there have been others?"<p>"You're coming with me. I can't have you wandering around<br/>terrorizing innocent girls," said Ryoga as he finally decided to<br/>ignore Akane for the moment.<p>"What? I'm no a mission! You can't order me around!" snapped the<br/>boy bitterly.<p>"Wanna bet?" said Ryoga with a small chuckle as his aura flared to<br/>life around him.<p>Lime stepped back; his expression changed to one of caution. "I<br/>won't be stopped!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"I had thought all of your kind were destroyed," said Cologne as<br/>she sat at a table inside the Cat Cafe. Across from her, a figure<br/>hidden in a long cloak sat silently as she talked. "Who could have<br/>imagined that there were survivors? What is it you want here?"<p>"I'm looking for someone," said Herb calmly.<p>"Oh?" said Cologne carefully.<p>"I'm looking for the man who destroyed the sacred springs. He must<br/>be punished," Herb's voice changed to one of anger, but he calmed<br/>visibly after he finished speaking.<p>"Destroyed?" muttered Cologne in shock. "I had not heard of this.<br/>I must say, that I am not entirely sympathetic. Those springs, while<br/>sacred to you, were a curse to all others."<p>"I understand, but I must find this one. He will not escape our<br/>wrath," said Herb in reply.<p>"How were the springs destroyed? Was Jusendo involved?" said the<br/>old woman cautiously. If the people of Phoenix Mountain were on the<br/>move again, it could threaten her tribe.<p>"Jusenkyo is nothing more than a lake, completely eradicated by a<br/>man known as Ranma Saotome," said Herb.<p>"Ranma Saotome?" gasped Cologne in shock. The cup of tea she had<br/>been drinking shattered on the ground at her feet. "You are certain of<br/>this?"<p>"The guide told us of him. He was living quite nicely in<br/>retirement. The man I speak of, created an explosion so powerful, that<br/>it destroyed all of Jusenkyo."<p>Cologne did her best to regain her composure. "And you intend to<br/>fight him?"<p>"I will destroy him, my power has been magnified many times. We<br/>were forced to unseal a sacred artifact that I am sure you are<br/>familiar with," said Herb as he brought out a sharp looking white<br/>object from behind his back.<p>"Sheng Long's tooth!" gasped Cologne. "I remember, we owe your<br/>people our very existence. Your ancestor destroyed the invading armies<br/>from the north, saving both our tribes."<p>"You know of this 'Ranma', I can see that much. Tell me what I<br/>wish to know," said Herb firmly. His tone was still respectful, and he<br/>bowed his head slightly.<p>"I have no choice," muttered Cologne as she turned her head away<br/>from him for a moment.<p>Her mind was now remembering something the boy had said to her on the<br/>beach. "You haven't even seen half my true power."<p>If that was even remotely true, she had to have him in the Amazon<br/>nation more than ever. He was far too valuable to lose now. She prayed<br/>that Herb would not kill him. A cold smile formed on her lips, and she<br/>looked up at the man across from her. "There is one way, that you can<br/>punish Ranma Saotome, more than death ever could."<p>Herb leaned forward, suddenly very interested in what she had to<br/>say. "I'm listening."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Huh?" said Ranma as he looked up at Ukyo. She was smiling at him<br/>cheerfully.<p>"I said, are you and Akane getting along well?" She casually<br/>brushed her hair over her shoulder, pretending to not really care<br/>about the answer. All present could tell that she was very interested<br/>though.<p>"Yeah! She's great!" chimed Ranma happily.<p>The girl's face fell slightly, but she returned to her cheerful<br/>demeanor once again. "So, what have you been up too?"<p>Ranma blinked, stuffing the last one of his seven whole<br/>okonomiyaki into his mouth he looked at her. "Well, we went to the<br/>beach the other day. That was kinda nice. It was a family type thing,<br/>I could tell everyone missed Nabiki."<p>"Nabiki?" said Ukyo with a small frown.<p>"Yeah, she's Akane's sister. She died a few months ago, we're<br/>gonna bring her back to life in a couple of months though!" said the<br/>boy cheerfully.<p>Ukyo looked at him for a moment. "Um? You can do that?"<p>"Well, I can't, but the Great Dragon, Sheng Long can! If you<br/>gather together these seven balls, and say the right words, he'll<br/>appear, and grant you a wish!" Ranma grinned dumbly at her.<p>"You can be so weird sometimes, Ranchan," said the girl as she<br/>brushed it off as a joke of some kind.<p>"Anyway, we went to the beach, and Ryoga showed up. It was great!<br/>He helped us beat up this hundred year old woman, who gave Akane this<br/>weird curse."<p>Ukyo sat and listened intently for a moment, unsure of what to<br/>say. "So, Ryoga is that guy I saw at the school? The one who threw<br/>that energy thing at you, and was flying around?"<p>"Huh? No, that's just Kuno. He went off and trained with Master<br/>Roshi, and Master Happosai. Ryoga trained with Piccolo."<p>"That demon thing from a long time ago?" said the girl as her eyes<br/>went wide.<p>"Yeah, the one my dad fought," said Ranma obliviously. He took a<br/>gulp of his drink and chuckled. "I hope I get to fight him some day!<br/>He's real strong!"<p>Ukyo stared at him in shock. "You can't be serious!"<p>Ranma blinked and looked up at her. "Sure. Why not?"<p>The girl shook her head for a moment. "So, what happened to your<br/>tail?"<p>"It got cut off," replied Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"What?" said Ukyo as she stood up suddenly.<p>"Yeah, Pop said they had to do it, after I turned into a monster<br/>and attacked Tokyo," said the boy with another shrug. "No big deal<br/>really."<p>Ukyo was having trouble standing. "You're joking right?"<p>Ranma simply shook his head from side to side for a moment. He<br/>seemed uncertain what the excitement was all about.<p>"I've got to sit down," grumbled Ukyo. "What's wrong? Why is he<br/>avoiding the truth? Could it be that he doesn't want to tell me about<br/>this girl?" she thought in frustration.<p>"Yup...Uh, I gotta go! Akane'll get mad if I take too long. Thanks<br/>for the food Ucchan!" said Ranma as he jumped to his feet. He tossed a<br/>few yen bills on the table and dashed out the door with a grin on his<br/>face.<p>"Right," said the girl as she waved him off. She looked down at<br/>the floor and sighed, brushing the front of the skirt from her uniform<br/>off a bit.<p>"Ukyo," said her father Gruffly as he walked up behind her. "If<br/>you keep this up, he's going to hurt you. I don't want to see that."<p>"Dad...I..."<p>"I know, I tried my best, but Goku Saotome is a man of great<br/>honor. I could not persuade him to break his promise to his old<br/>friend, no matter what I said. I imagine his son will be no different.<br/>Ukyo, if you continue down this path, he will hurt you." The man<br/>walked away, leaving her to think on her own.<p>Ukyo looked at the doorway for a moment. She sighed and turned<br/>away, determination burning in her eyes. "I won't give up! Ever! I'll<br/>show him I can be a much better bride than that girl will ever be!"<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma paused as he looked at Ryoga Hibiki, who was imbedded in the<br/>ground in the middle of the sidewalk.<p>"Saotome," said the boy in greeting from his place on the ground.<p>"Are... you all right?" said the pigtailed boy as he leaned down<br/>to peer at him for a moment.<p>"That fiancee of yours is a real bitch," said Ryoga as he stood up<br/>and dusted himself off. "She hit me from behind, and then attacked<br/>some guy."<p>"Akane?" said Ranma in shock.<p>"That's right, last I saw. She was carrying the poor man over her<br/>shoulder," said Ryoga with a small frown.<p>"Akane's been kidnapped?" gasped Ranma in shock.<p>"Apparently you weren't listening, she carried him off. Meaning,<br/>she kidnapped him," said Ryoga with a frown.<p>"Where were they going?" said Ranma as he glanced around.<p>"Well, after she scared him half to death, he muttered something<br/>about the Cat Cafe, and I guess she took him there."<p>"Right! Thanks!" said Ranma as he dashed off in pursuit.<p>"Hey!" grumbled Ryoga as he attempted to follow, but gave up and<br/>shrugged. "I guess it's none of my business. We'll meet again Ranma,<br/>I'll deal with you then."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"You is staying at Cat Cafe? Is Great Grandmother's guests?" said<br/>Shampoo cheerfully.<p>"Yup! Uh huh!" said Mint happily as he walked with the girl.<br/>Mousse was still pinned to the wall nearby, muttering to himself.<p>"More than I can handle, huh?" snapped Akane angrily as she<br/>rounded a nearby corner. She paused when she saw Shampoo standing with<br/>another young boy. "Does this belong to you?"<p>"Aiya! Turtle Shell Girl find other guest!" said the Amazon<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Wow! We both got to talk to girls!" said Mint as he looked at the<br/>prone and beaten form of his companion over Akane's shoulder.<p>"I had no idea girls were so strong," said Lime, he was still in a<br/>slight daze. "Can we still have tea or something?"<p>"No, now shut up, or I'll just dump you here," snapped the girl<br/>angrily as she turned towards the Cafe.<p>"Yes, Ma am," grumbled the boy.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Interesting," said Herb calmly as he stood up and glared down at<br/>her. "I assume you want him alive for something?"<p>"You'll understand when you meet him," said Cologne with a small<br/>nod.<p>"I'll consider it," said the man with a slight smirk.<p>"My plan will benefit us both," said Cologne smugly. "However, I<br/>cannot force you to comply."<p>Herb frowned slightly, seeming to lose interest for a moment.<br/>"Where are Lime and Mint?"<p>"Your two wards?" said Cologne with her eyebrow raised.<p>"Yes, they should have been here by now," snapped the man with a<br/>slight growl.<p>"They'll be along," said Cologne with a small nod. "There isn't<br/>much in Nerima that would be dangerous to them."<p>"Those two idiots are likely to find the one thing that could,"<br/>grumbled Herb as he looked across the room, towards the door for a<br/>moment.<p>"Is here now," said Shampoo as she walked in with Mint at her<br/>side. "Hello Great Grandmother. Shampoo find guests."<p>"Women," said Herb as he stood up again, staring at the young<br/>Shampoo in shock.<p>Akane Tendo walked in behind her, with Lime hanging over her<br/>shoulder. "Where do you want this idiot?"<p>Cologne instinctively moved between Herb and Shampoo. The man's<br/>gaze had changed, and he was staring at Akane now. "Young girls. I've<br/>never seen..."<p>"Well hello Akane Tendo," said Cologne with a small nod. The girl<br/>was placing Lime in one of the chairs in the restaurant. She looked up<br/>and blinked at the old woman.<p>Herb's smile widened, and he removed his hood. His hair was long<br/>and white, with dark colored bangs that surrounded his face. A cold<br/>smile formed on his lips as he glared at her. "So, you are Akane<br/>Tendo?"<p>"Another one?" snapped Akane irritably as she moved into a<br/>fighting stance.<p>"Hmm, perhaps we will change the plan, I may decide to keep this<br/>one," muttered Herb to himself as he looked the girl up and down for a<br/>moment.<p>"What?" gasped Akane.<p>Herb shot forward, and appeared in front of her. He glared down<br/>imposingly, the cloak rustled slightly, revealing a wide and well-<br/>muscled chest. "Hello. Would you like to go on a date with me?"<p>The last thing Akane remembered, was Herb's fist slamming into her<br/>face.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Goku sat with Soun at the shogi table once again. It was a lazy<br/>afternoon, and the children would be home in a few moments. Both men<br/>paused, frowning slightly.<p>"Did you feel that, Saotome?" asked Soun.<p>"I did," muttered Goku as he glanced around for a moment. "That's<br/>a pretty big power, and it isn't familiar either."<p>"Should we?" muttered Soun.<p>"I can feel Ranma nearby," commented Goku. "It doesn't feel<br/>dangerous, not yet."<p>"We should be fine then," said Soun cheerfully.<p>"Right, I don't see any reason to worry yet," agreed Goku as he<br/>went back to the game, which was now in favor of Soun somehow. With a<br/>single move, Goku managed to change that.<p>Soun's jaw dropped as he looked at the board again.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma frowned, something was wrong. Akane's ki flared for a<br/>moment, and then dropped dramatically. There was also a strange power<br/>coming from his destination. "Something is up. I'd better hurry."<p>Ranma's aura flared, and he blasted into the sky.<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The Monkey and The Dragon!<p>Why is Herb a guy?<p>Well, cause Ranma blew up Jusenkyo, that's why. He couldn't get<br/>cursed without the spring, right?<p>Usually I'd keep something like that dragon tooth a secret.<br/>Without it, Herb would get creamed. I'm assuming everyone would know<br/>that. So I went ahead and revealed it now.<p>
