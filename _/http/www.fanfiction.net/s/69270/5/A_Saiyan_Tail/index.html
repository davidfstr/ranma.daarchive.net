</div>A Saiyan tail<p>Part 16<p>The Eternal Lost Saiyan.<p>"Ranma, what's wrong? You've been edgy all day," said Akane as she sat down next to her fiancee at the table inside the Tendo home.<p>"Nothin, something just feels wrong," muttered the boy as he shifted his position again. "Pop says he's coming back today."<p>"I hope they leave Kuno there," grumbled Akane as she walked away from him leaving him to his thoughts.<p>The boy merely nodded and lay back with his arms behind his head. "I know something is wrong here, but what is it?"<p>Kurillin floated slowly through the air towards his master's island. He had a strange frown on his face as he moved over the water. His mind kept returning to the battle over and over.<p>"Please, just stay down! I don't want to hurt you!" The yellow clad warrior had whispered this into his ear as he delivered the last blow. He had complied almost reluctantly and hid below the surface of the water for a few moments until the pair had left, there was no way he could take him and Piccolo together, something was odd about that boy. He began to hope that maybe, just maybe; things weren't as bad as they seemed. "Usually they're worse." He snorted at his own comment and pushed his speed a little more as he saw the island appear on the horizon.<p>Happosai and Kame Senin stared at the boy in shock. It had taken some time to calm the boy down. "Let me get this straight. You want training?" asked Happosai.<p>"Of course! Why else would a noble personage such as myself come to such squalor as this?" answered the boy calmly. The two old men were sitting with him at a table with tea spread out between them.<p>"Squalor huh? Sorry kid, I'm not taking students right now," said Roshi as he stood up and turned away.<p>"I will pay any price!" announced the boy loudly as he stood and raised his bokuten into the air.<p>"So what?" snorted Happosai as he followed behind him. "Hey Roshi, where's that new issue of 'Bigguns' you said we got in the mail?"<p>"You are refusing me?" gasped the boy in disbelief.<p>"That about sums it up doesn't it kid? Better get going, it's a long swim back to the mainland," said Roshi absently as he rummaged through a pile of magazines that lay next to a hammock just outside the home.<p>"Surely the vast fortune of the Kuno family will be able to persuade you..." pleaded the boy, he somehow managed to make even that look arrogant.<p>"Not even if you slapped me with a wad of bills," said the bald man flatly.<p>Kuno immediately did so.<p>"Now look here kid..." started the old man as his patience wore thin.<p>"Hold on there a moment Roshi, let's not be too rash here..." said Happosai as he eyed the money carefully.<p>"You hear something Happy?" said the other man as he cocked his head immediately losing interest in the situation.<p>Kurillin landed lightly between the three and glanced around. "Master! Are Goku and Soun still here?"<p>"Left about an hour ago. Why?" said Happosai as he hopped to the man's side.<p>"We've got big trouble."<p>Ryoga paused as he saw Tokyo spread out below him. "We made it."<p>"No thanks to you kid," growled his companion almost angrily.<p>Ryoga glanced over his shoulder, but let the matter pass. "Do you think he knows we're here?"<p>"I don't know, I don't feel Goku's presence nearby," said the green man calmly.<p>"That doesn't concern me," replied Ryoga.<p>"The brat definitely knows you're here," snorted the Namek with a disinterested look on his face. He turned his back on his student and started to float away.<p>"What do you mean?" The question went unanswered and Ryoga stopped and smiled as he realized what the man had meant. "He's coming. Well, I'm ready for you this time Saotome!" He simply floated where he was and waited.<p>Kasumi shrieked in surprise and as Ranma suddenly jumped up like a rod and looked around the room excitedly his battle aura flared up for a half second before he calmed.<p>"Oh my, is something wrong Ranma?" asked the girl almost nervously.<p>The boy glanced over his shoulder at her with a frown on his face and nodded. "He's here." With that said he blasted out the door and into the sky leaving a trail of light behind him.<p>Son Goku was currently moving towards Japan with Soun trailing right behind him. "What are we going to do when we get back? I hope Kasumi has something for us to eat."<p>"Why Saotome, I thought you knew. We have a wedding to plan!" exclaimed the mustached man excitedly.<p>"Huh? Why?" said his friend obliviously.<p>"Saotome! I'm surprised at you! Our two children have been alone together for almost two days now! Surely nature has taken its course by now!"<p>"Nature? I went before we left Tendo," said Goku in confusion.<p>"Ha ha! Sometimes I forget how naïve you can be sometimes Saotome! Our children must be in love by now! They've had two whole days of quality time together! Training in the arts, the demure female student and her hard but handsome instructor. Oh, my little girl is a woman now!" The man began to cry in mid flight.<p>"She wasn't a woman before?" Goku's eyes went wide at the mere thought of it. "Boy, she really is a tomboy. I don't know if they can get married if she's really a b.."<p>"Saotome, what do you think they'll name our grandchild?" interrupted Soun. He was too far into his emotions to notice what his friend had said.<p>That was something Goku understood immediately. He felt his heart jump into his throat and blasted forward at twice the speed as before.<p>Soun faltered for a moment in the air and blinked in surprise. "Saotome?"<p>Akane walked out of her room dressed in a sundress and T-shirt. She sighed as she adjusted the straps on her turtle shell as she walked by a mirror. "I hate this thing."<p>"Oh there you are Akane!" said Kasumi as she walked out of the kitchen. "I thought, you'd left with Ranma."<p>The younger girl jumped down the stairs and looked at her sister in confusion. "Ranma left? Where did he go?"<p>"Oh he just flew out the back door a moment ago. I hope everything is all right, he seemed worried." Kasumi cheerfully swept the floor around her sister as Akane stood silently in place.<p>"What? Why would he..." It hit her like a ton of bricks. "He's here!"<p>"So, we meet again Saotome," said Ryoga calmly as the pigtailed martial artist appeared behind him.<p>"Yup, you've grown stronger Ryoga," said the boy casually. He was floating in a relaxed position and had yet to make a move against the boy.<p>"I could say the same of you. Been training have you?" said the lost boy without turning towards his opponent.<p>"Of course," acknowledged Ranma with a small shrug. "We need to talk first though."<p>Ryoga laughed and moved out of the lotus position he had been waiting in. "The time for talking is passed Ranma. Because of you, I have seen hell and welcomed it. Now I am truly a demon."<p>Ranma immediately moved into a defensive stance and frowned. "Wait Ryoga, you don't understand. We can..."<p>"Die!" screamed the lost boy as an aura burned around him suddenly. It was a deep blue flame and he screamed in effort and rage as his power jumped suddenly. He spun around and blasted towards Ranma to fast for the boy's eyes to follow.<p>The pigtailed boy shifted his weight at the last moment and Ryoga appeared beside him with his fist extended in a punch. "Wait a minute!" His protest was met with an elbow to his face and Ranma sailed into the air. Ryoga smirked and vanished for a moment, only to appear in the air above his opponent. Ranma noticed this and grit his teeth, bracing himself for the impact.<p>Goku froze in mid flight and glanced around him. "Tendo."<p>His companion followed suit and nodded in agreement. "I feel it too, a battle."<p>"They're both real strong," commented Goku as he looked in the direction of Japan. "One of them feels like..." He suddenly shot forward at full speed leaving Soun behind.<p>"Saotome! Wait!" exclaimed the man in surprise as he watched his friend fade into the distance.<p>Goku's features hardened as he flew towards home. "Don't worry son. I'm coming!"<p>Ranma slammed into the ground in the middle of the city and cried out in pain as he left a smoking impact crater where he landed. "If that's how he wants to be then fine! Here I come Ryoga!"<p>The lost boy smiled and prepared himself. "I was hoping you wouldn't make this too easy."<p>Ranma slammed into him at top speed and Ryoga shifted his weight easily avoiding the blow. "You're getting slow Ranma!"<p>"I'll show you how slow I am!" cried Ranma as he turned in mid kick and punched the boy in his gut. Ryoga lurched forward and frowned suddenly.<p>"I felt that." He slammed his elbow into Ranma's back sending him plummeting down again.<p>The pigtailed boy caught himself in the air and looked around only to find his opponent was gone. "Damn, I lost him."<p>"Too bad I didn't lose you!" cried Ryoga as he appeared behind Ranma and kicked him in the back. The pigtailed boy was thrown forward and flipped in the air several times before landing feet first against the side of the building cracking the bricks as he hit. He pushed himself off and slammed into Ryoga's chest sending the lost boy staggering back in the air.<p>"He's building power, good," thought the lost boy as he regained control and paused in mid air. Debris from the building rained down on the busy street below, most of the bricks were relatively small and no one was seriously hurt. Ranma glanced down and growled before turning his attention back on his opponent.<p>"Are you out of your mind? We can't fight here, someone could get hurt!"<p>"So?" snapped Ryoga coldly. "I've already killed once. What's a few hundred more?"<p>Ranma paused and glared at his opponent for a moment. "Catch me if you can Ryoga!" His aura flared around him again and he shot across the sky like a bullet.<p>"Damn!" snapped Ryoga; he focused his power before following the boy's energy signature across the sky.<p>Piccolo watched the scene from a nearby rooftop and smirked. "Good, now that the brat is out of the way I can focus my attention on Goku. Even if he wins, the runt will be too weak to help his father much." He rose into the air and floated away lazily.<p>Goku paused as he reached the edge of the city and looked around. "They're moving away from the city. That's good, I'd better follow just to be sure though." He started off in the direction of the two battling powers.<p>"Not so fast!" cried a familiar voice. Goku froze and slowly turned around.<p>Piccolo was floating behind him with an evil aura surrounding his body. "You've got your own problems to deal with."<p>"What's going on here?" snapped the Saiyan angrily. "What have you done with my son?"<p>"Nothing, he's dealing with an old friend of his right now. I thought I'd take advantage of the situation and catch you alone."<p>"All you had to do was ask, I'd have fought you anytime you wanted," snapped Goku in retort.<p>"True, but if things got bad enough that boy would have stepped in," replied the demon coolly.<p>"I don't need his help to beat you," said Goku calmly.<p>"That remains to be seen," retorted Piccolo. "You aren't the only one who can get better you know."<p>"You are stronger, I can sense that much. This should be a good fight." A strange and familiar smile formed on the man's lips as he stared Piccolo down.<p>"I certainly hope so," agreed Piccolo.<p>Goku looked down at the city and turned his back on the demon. "Follow me."<p>"Of course," said the demon with a smirk on his lips. "I'll give you the honor of choosing your own grave."<p>Ranma stopped above a large barren grassland and turned to wait. It didn't take long for his opponent to appear in the air just above him.<p>"Are you finished running now?" snarled Ryoga impatiently.<p>"We should be able to fight here without any interruption," said Ranma with a smirk on his face. "No one will get hurt here."<p>Ryoga's face darkened. "You're wrong about that Saotome."<p>"We'll see," said the boy confidently. He removed his shirt and then took off the weighted black clothes, shoes, and bracers. The fell to the ground below and he snapped his neck a few times. "Ready when you are."<p>Ryoga smirked and took off his shoulder pads and shoes in the same manner. "Ranma, prepare to die!"<p>The pair clashed in the air sending a sonic boom across the valley as they slammed into each other.<p>Akane ran across the rooftops of Tokyo and paused on another rooftop. She closed her eyes and concentrated causing an aura to form around her body. "Where are they?" She opened her eyes and snorted in frustration. "Damn! They've flown off somewhere!" Her fist slammed into a nearby chimney sending pieces of rock flying in every direction as it shattered.<p>"What crazy turtle shell girl doing up here?" said a familiar voice from behind her. Akane looked behind her and saw Shampoo jump down beside her.<p>"What are you doing up here?"<p>"Shampoo looking for Girl-Ranma."<p>"She's not here," said Akane with a shrug.<p>"Shampoo know that! Is why still looking!" fumed the Amazon.<p>"See ya," muttered Akane as she jumped away.<p>"Hey, wait!" cried Shampoo as she moved after her.<p>"Sorry, I've got to find Ranma!" called Akane as she continued to move away. Her face hardened as she looked forward again. "Ranma! You won't keep me from getting my revenge!"<p>Shampoo managed to keep up just behind the angry girl and frowned. "What she is so angry about? Why she need find Ranma?" All at once it seemed to hit her that she was looking for the boy with the pigtail. She considered stopping for a moment, but the girl had caught her attention for some reason she couldn't explain. Somehow she knew she should be involved with whatever was going on.<p>TBC...<p>Cue overexcited baritone voice...<p>Next time on Saiyan Tail! Ranma faces off against the mighty Ryoga, but will he be strong enough to face down the Saiyan powerhouse?<br/>Meanwhile, Goku has his own problems. On his way to aid his son, who should he meet up with but the evil demon Piccolo! What new power does the evil demon have? Will he be able to stand up the awesome new powers of the devil?<br/>All the while, Akane and Shampoo rush towards the battlegrounds. Will they make it in time to help our hero? Find out next time on Saiyan Tail!<p>Cue bad Americanized animation sequence for credits...<p>C&amp;C to:<p>Previous parts can be found at: .com/misatira/<p>
