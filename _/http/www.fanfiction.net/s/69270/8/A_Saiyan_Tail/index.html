</div>A Saiyan Tail<p>Part 19<p>Another demon in Nerima?<p>+++++++<p>Ranma woke up lazily from his sleeping bag and smiled as he walked outside onto the mountain. The sound of laughter seemed to fill the air, giving the day an almost surreal feel. He glanced up and saw Akane floating through the branches of the forest cheerfully. The girl was watching a bird feed its young on a nearby branch.<p>He smiled and floated up next to her. "Nice day isn't it?"<p>Akane jumped in surprise and blushed slightly. "Oh, you're up."<p>"Pop's still sleeping, we got a little time before we head back," said the pigtailed boy cheerfully. "What ya doin anyway?"<p>"Just watching the birds. The little ones are so cute," said the girl with her smile widening slightly as she looked back at the tiny balls of fuzz resting inside the nest. The adult had flown off in search of more food.<p>"I guess so, never really thought about it really," commented Ranma as he looked at them for a moment.<p>"It figures," grumbled the girl as she rolled her eyes. She often wondered if he was trying to ruin the moment at times.<p>He turned back towards her with a gentle smile on his lips. "You know, you're right Akane."<p>She felt the heat build up in her face suddenly as he gazed at her. A gentle breeze blew by them through the trees, shifting his hair slightly. Akane could feel herself growing slightly lighter in her stomach. "Ranma..."<p>The boy turned away and looked back at the baby birds again. A long silence drifted through the air between them. He slowly turned towards her again. "Akane..."<p>"Yes?" she murmured.<p>"I'm hungry. Let's go wake Pop up."<p>++++++++++<p>Saotome Goku yawned as he left his tent and glanced around. It was another beautiful day. He glanced back at the small shelter and chuckled. He never had things like this in his own youth. He stepped over the fallen form of his son and blinked. "Huh?"<p>Ranma was lying on the ground with what appeared to be a shattered boulder scattered around his head. He bent down and glanced around at the camp. Akane was sitting on a log with her arms crossed over her chest, grumbling to herself angrily.<p>"Son, what did you do?"<p>"I don't think I'm allowed to eat anymore," muttered the boy with a horrified stare.<p>"What?" cried his father in shock.<p>"I just said I was hungry, and she blew her top!" whispered the boy as he gave his fiancee nervous glances.<p>"Man. Even Nodoka wasn't that bad," muttered Goku as he stared at his future daughter in law for a moment.<p>Akane spared them both an annoyed stare and they cowered away from her for a moment. "Idiots."<p>+++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, in Nerima...<p>"Shampoo, those men should be returning today, with your fiancee," said Cologne as she sipped lazily at her tea.<p>The two teens were preparing the restaurant for business. The young girl bounced up and down cheerfully, in a display that would send any boy at Furinkan to his knees as he tried to stop the blood from violently escaping his nostrils.<p>"Shampoo so happy! Soon, she get to be with Airen, yes?"<p>Mousse scowled at the scene and resumed his scrubbing. "At last! I can have my revenge! That girl won't beat me this time!"<p>Cologne nodded to herself at both teens' reactions. Everything was going according to plan. How to find that girl though? She was quite elusive. "We'll go see them later. I have some things I'd like to discuss with that girl's father."<p>+++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki sat in a small bar in Japan. There was about a foot of show outside, so he figured that he was somewhere on Okinawa. A cup of hot sake sat in his hands, helping to push away the cold outside.<p>"Hey, how long you gonna sit there?" said the bartender as he noticed the boy had not yet moved.<p>"I've just got some things on my mind," replied the boy lazily.<p>"Eh? Like what?" said the man lazily.<p>"Life, death, the usual I suppose. I've just got a lot to sort through."<p>"Woman troubles? We get a lot of that here," said the barkeep as he nodded understanding.<p>"Actually, yes. Not the way you're thinking though," replied the boy as he looked down at the small flask next to his hands. He refilled his cup and downed it in a single gulp.<p>"You've really been putting those away. I don't want no trouble, and you're a little young..." started the man with a worried tone.<p>"Doesn't effect me too much these days," said Ryoga coolly. "I'm not ordering anymore. Don't worry. I just wanted something hot." He did notice that he was starting to feel the effects of the alcohol though.<p>"Oh, all right then," said the man with a small nod as he turned away.<p>"Damn you Ranma. How long am I going to have to wait?" he muttered while pouring himself another drink.<p>The doors to the bar opened, and a figure wearing a long cloak stepped inside. His face was a scowl, and was well hidden in the shadows of his coat. He walked up to the bar and knocked against the wood to get the bartender's attention.<p>"I'm looking for someone."<p>"So are a lot of people," said the barkeep with a shrug.<p>"His name is Saotome, sound familiar?" The cloaked man reached across the bar and pulled the much larger man up by his collar, lifting him off the ground easily.<p>The barkeep shook his head from side to side violently. "Nope. Never heard of him."<p>"I don't need to remind you of anything do I?" snarled the stranger angrily.<p>"I'm tellin ya! I don't know no Saotome!" said the man nervously.<p>"What would you want with the likes of him?" said Ryoga suddenly.<p>The stranger turned his head and stared at the boy at the end of the bar. He was sitting calmly and had not moved yet. "That's none of your business."<p>"I guess I can't help you then," said the lost boy as he stood up and walked towards the door.<p>"I'll make you tell me then!" snapped the stranger as he jumped forward and punched at Ryoga.<p>The lost boy caught the strike easily and smirked. Whoever this was, he was no match for Ranma. Then again, who besides him was? "Heh, You'll find him in Tokyo, Nerima." He released the arm and walked out the door.<p>The stranger growled under his breath and lowered his arm. "That guy's better than I thought he'd be. I'll come back and find him again later. I've got business to take care of first." He followed the boy out into the street. "Then again, no one does that to me and lives." He saw a few tracks leading away from the bar in the snow. He paused when they suddenly ended about ten feet away.<p>+++++++++++<p>"I'm home!" called Akane as she walked into her house with a wide grin on her face.<p>A brown blur, moving at almost inhuman speed slammed into her from nowhere. She hung her head as her father attempted to squeeze the life from her body.<p>"Wahhhh! My baby girl has returned! Oh! How I've missed you!" cried the man.<p>"Daaaadd!" grumbled the girl in embarrassment as Ranma and Goku appeared behind her in the doorway.<p>"You should really get out more, Tendo," commented Goku as he watched the pathetic display in front of him.<p>"Hey! When's dinner? I'm starving!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Oh! I'm glad you're back Ranma!" said Kasumi as she poked her head out of the kitchen and smiled at the boy. "Dinner will be ready in a bit, but I ran out of soy sauce. Could you go to the store for me?"<p>"You bet!" said the boy cheerfully.<p>Akane frowned at him, she could have sworn she heard his stomach growl under that statement.<p>"Come on Akane!" said Ranma as he turned towards the door.<p>"She asked you to go," snapped the girl.<p>"I'm gonna fly, it'll be faster. You need the practice," said the boy as he opened the door.<p>"We just got back!" snapped the girl in irritation.<p>"Now Akane, I think it's sweet that your fiancee wants to spend time with you," said the elder girl.<p>"I guess so..." muttered the reluctant girl as she stalked out the door after him. "Hey! Wait up you jerk!"<p>"Race ya!" chimed Ranma from just above her.<p>"Ah, that brings back memories, Saotome," said Soun wistfully as he watched the pair fly away.<p>"Yup," agreed Goku as he walked into the home.<p>++++++++++++<p>"I told you! We just got back! I didn't have time to recharge!" snapped Akane as they walked home from the store.<p>"Sorry, I forget you're still learning," said the pigtailed boy as he flipped the plastic bag with the soy sauce over his shoulder.<p>"Yeah," muttered Akane as she forced herself too look away.<p>The sky was growing dark above them and it looked like rain would fall soon.<p>"You wanna run for it? I bet we can beat the rain," said Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>"No. I think it's kind of nice here," said the girl with a slight blush on her face as she subconsciously moved closer to his side. "It's so peaceful right now."<p>"Yeah, it is nice," said the boy as he looked up at the clouds.<p>"Ranma Saotome?" said a new voice from behind them.<p>Akane whirled around with a flash of anger in her eyes. "Who?"<p>"Yeah," said the boy cheerfully as he also regarded the cloaked man standing behind them.<p>Without a word, the stranger attacked.<p>"Ranma!" cried Akane in alarm as the boy's arm met with empty space as Ranma vanished from sight.<p>"Who the heck are you?" snapped the pigtailed boy in irritation.<p>"Huh," chuckled the evil looking boy as he threw his cloak off and stood in front of them. He was wearing a strange vest that looked like it was made of scales, and loose fitting black pants, he also had a pair of nylons tied around his waist like a sash.<p>"Who the?" muttered Ranma as he tried to think of who the stranger was.<p>"We've never met," said the boy with a slight smirk. He charged forward again attacking with a flurry of punches and kicks. He never even touched his target once.<p>"Hey! Cut that out!" snapped Ranma lazily. He stopped cold and landed a punch in the boy's midsection.<p>The stranger flew into a nearby wall and shattered it on impact.<p>"Ranma! What have you done?" gasped Akane as she started to move towards the pile.<p>"Don't worry, he can take it," replied the pigtailed boy as he walked over to where the stranger was dusting himself off and glaring at him.<p>"You'll regret that."<p>"What the heck do you want?" snapped Ranma.<p>The rain began to fall lightly around them. "Huh," chuckled the boy as he spread his arms wide. As the water changed Ranma into a girl, he began to grow into a massive beast. It had the head of a bull and the body of a Yeti, with hooves for feet. An eel waved behind its back in place of a tail, and two crane wings spread out from behind its shoulders. "Bu fu."<p>"What the heck is that?" said Ranma in shock. It was enough for the beast to get a good shot in. The pigtailed girl was thrown into a wall opposite the thing and shattered it as well.<p>"Ranma!" cried Akane in alarm as she moved towards him.<p>"Why you dirty..." grumbled the girl as she slowly rose from the debris.<p>The beast didn't waist any time though, it lowered its head and charged. A moment later, its two horns were impaled in the ground where the redhead had once been lying.<p>"You crazy jerk! What the heck are you tryin to do?" snapped Ranma from beside it.<p>The thing blinked and looked over at her in surprise.<p>"Look, if you're mad about the springs... I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to blow them up, it was kind of an accident," grumbled the girl in embarrassment.<p>This caused the beast to pause. "She blew up Jusenkyo? What the?" It staggered back and noticed the other girl standing on the sidelines. "You're too fast to catch, even like this. So I'll make you come to me!" it thought evilly.<p>Akane gasped as the thing picked her up in its hand and started to fly away. "Put me down!"<p>"Akane!" cried Ranma as she blasted into the air after her fiancee.<p>The beast looked behind it and spun around in mid air as the redhead flew up into its face. The girl stopped dead in front of him and scowled.<p>"Let her go. Now."<p>The thing looked at the angry girl in his hand. She didn't look particularly scared at the moment. Just plain pissed off. With a shrug it released its grip and she fell away, promptly plummeting to the ground.<p>He paused when he noticed that the redhead hadn't gone after her. He really wished he could talk right now, he had no idea how the hell she was flying.<p>"You bastard! You tried to kill me!" snapped another voice from behind him. The beast turned to see the other girl hovering in the air just behind him.<p>"Uh oh," muttered the redhead as she seemed to disappear from in front of him.<p>"Uh oh?" thought the beast. "Oh, shit."<p>"Ka me ha me haaaa!" screamed Akane as she blasted the thing out of the sky. It stayed for a moment, simply smoking in mid air. Finally, it plummeted headfirst into the ground.<p>"What the heck was that about?" said Ranma in confusion. She landed on the ground and retrieved the soy sauce.<p>"I don't know, but that guy was a real jerk!" snapped Akane.<p>"Um, can we go now? I'm kinda hungry," said Ranma with a little uncertainty.<p>"Me too," agreed Akane as she started towards home.<p>The beast glanced up at the retreating teens and snorted. They were too young to be the ones he was looking for anyway. He slowly staggered to his feet and checked the next name on his list. "Goku Saotome." He thought about it for a minute and crossed that name out as well. "Happosai." It nodded for a moment and seemed pleased with itself. "Anything to be out of this crazy place." With that said it flew into the air, and limped away across the sky.<p>++++++++++<p>"Cologne, is it?" said Goku.<p>"Yes. According to our laws, your daughter has to marry my Shampoo. I'm sure you understand. This is a matter of honor." Cologne sat with the two Chinese teens on either side of her.<p>"That's fine, but..."<p>"But?" said Cologne with a raised eyebrow. "The laws are quite clear. I'm afraid I must insist."<p>"Well, I don't think..."<p>"I really must insist Mr. Saotome. This is not something our people take lightly. If your daughter does not wed my Shampoo, there will be consequences; both to Shampoo, and your daughter." Cologne seemed quite insistent.<p>"But I don't have a daughter," said Goku finally. "Ranma, is an only child."<p>"Pardon?" said the elder with wide eyes. "Then who is that girl? She is of relation to you. I can tell that much by just looking at her."<p>"Well, it's kinda complicated," muttered Goku in embarrassment.<p>"How hard can it be? You must tell her that she has to marry my Shampoo!" snapped the old woman angrily. "I don't care if she's your third cousin. The laws are very strict."<p>"Ranma has to marry my Akane!" interjected Soun.<p>"Tendo, you aren't helping," muttered Goku to the man. Soun glared at him, but fell silent. "Look, Ranma's already engaged. I can't break that promise."<p>"I wasn't speaking of the boy! The girl, she is the one we want," snapped Cologne.<p>"Oh boy," muttered Goku as he tried desperately to think of some way to calm everyone down long enough to explain things<p>"We're home!" cried a familiar voice from the hallway. Akane walked in with her fiancee in tow. Ranma was still a girl of course.<p>"Sorry we took so long," said Ranma as she handed her delivery over.<p>"I was getting worried," said the elder girl cheerfully.<p>"We ran into this weird monster. It attacked us, and tried to kidnap Akane. She took care of it though," said the redhead happily. "She's gotten real strong!"<p>"Thanks," muttered Akane with a blush.<p>"Well, there you are, Daughter in law," said Cologne as she hopped in front of the pair.<p>"Daughter in law?" said Akane in confusion.<p>"Aiya! Airen!" chimed Shampoo as she latched onto the confused redhead's neck.<p>"Prepare to die!" screamed Mousse as he charged forward.<p>"Now, let's be nice. We are guests after all," said Cologne as she put the angry boy down with a poke of her staff. "Now young lady, why don't you come back with us now. You're betrothed would like to get to know you."<p>"How many times do I have to say I ain't like that!" snapped Ranma.<p>"I'm sure you'll learn. Come along now," said the old woman coolly.<p>"Who the heck are you to make demands like that?" snapped Akane.<p>"You should learn to respect your elders young lady," replied Cologne.<p>"I ain't goin with nobody!" said Ranma angrily.<p>"Very well, perhaps another time then," said the old woman cheerfully.<p>"No way," said Ranma angrily.<p>"Child, please calm down. We aren't trying to harm you, but you must understand that Shampoo must return home with her wife. You do not have a choice in this matter. It is a matter of honor." Cologne sighed and motioned for the others to follow.<p>"What the heck is she doing here anyway?" said Ranma with a small frown as she watched them move down the hall.<p>"She came and told me that you had to marry Shampoo," said Goku with a small shrug.<p>"You'll marry my Shampoo soon enough," cackled the old woman as she attempted to poke Ranma in her stomach as she passed by. The redhead moved out of the way easily and blinked. "Soon you'll be begging me too."<p>"I doubt that," she muttered as she watched them walk out the door.<p>"Saotome! Don't just sit there! Help me fix this hole!" said Soun with tears in his eyes as he nailed boards over Shampoo's entrance.<p>"I guess they don't have doors where she comes from huh?" said Goku as he walked over to help his friend.<p>"This is getting out of hand," commented Akane as she eyed the hallway angrily. "Who does she think she is? Just barging in here and making demands like that? The nerve!"<p>Ranma nodded and walked towards the bath. "She's right, it is getting out of hand. I'd better do something about this."<p>+++++++++<p>"That girl is good. Too good," thought Cologne as she walked back towards the Cat Café with her two charges behind her. Actually, Shampoo was carrying Mousse over her shoulder. "How can a girl that young be so skilled? It shouldn't be possible..."<p>"How we get Airen to come with us?" said Shampoo with a slight frustration in her voice.<p>"Easy. That girl's pride is enough to ensnare her," replied the old woman. "We just need to trap her. That shouldn't be too hard. I've got a trick or two up my sleeve, don't worry."<p>"Yes Great Grandmother," said Shampoo with a small sigh. She didn't really want to marry a woman, but it was better than getting herself killed challenging her. Unfortunately, Cologne seemed to be underestimating the girl as well. She had warned her, but the old woman refused to believe that someone so young could be that strong. "What we do?"<p>"It has already been done," replied the old woman. "Now we simply wait. That girl thinks I was aiming at her."<p>+++++++++<p>At the Tendo Dojo, Akane Tendo rubbed at her stomach in irritation as she ate. She lifted up her shirt a little and noticed a small red mark on her belly. "What the? What is this?" She didn't recall doing anything that would cause a bruise like that. "Oh well, I must have gotten it training or something."<p>"D'ya say somethin Akane?" said Ranma as he noticed her inspecting her stomach.<p>"No, I'm going to take a bath now," said the girl as she stood up from the table.<p>++++++++++<p>No more than three minutes later, the entire household was on their feet as a blood curdling scream ripped through the air.<p>"Akane!" cried Ranma as he rushed into the bathroom. Only to receive a shampoo bottle in his face, followed by other bathing supplies that chased him out of the room.<p>"Pervert! Get out!" screamed the girl from inside.<p>"Let me Ranma. You really shouldn't, you're not married yet," said Kasumi sweetly as she walked by the confused boy.<p>"Now what the heck did I do?" he muttered as he walked back to the concerned men.<p>A moment later, Akane emerged, dressed in a dirty looking dogi. "Sorry if I scared you. I just scalded myself."<p>Ranma walked into the room and noticed Kasumi testing the water. "It's barely warm," noted the girl.<p>Ranma walked up to the water and did the same. "She's right."<p>"But if felt so hot!" snapped Akane as she plunged her arm into the water. She promptly screamed in pain and pulled it out. The skin was beet red where she had gotten it wet.<p>"It was that old woman! When she missed me, she hit Akane. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but..." said Ranma after a moment's thought.<p>"That old bat did this to me? I'll kill her!" snarled Akane.<p>"We'll go over there tomorrow, Akane," agreed Ranma. "I've got to settle this, once and for all."<p>+++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: I'm assuming all of us know where this is going.<p>As for why I used the 'Full Body Cat's Tongue' instead of something else? I was feeling lazy, and didn't want to think of anything new. It would be annoying to a normal person, not as much as a cursed one, but still irritating.<p>
