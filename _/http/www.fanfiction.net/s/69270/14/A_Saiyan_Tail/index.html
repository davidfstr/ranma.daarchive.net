</div>A Saiyan Tail<p>Part 25<p>Heart of the Dragon.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma blasted forward at full speed. Tearing through the skies of<br/>Nerima for only a few seconds before reaching his destination.<p>Cologne looked up in surprise, as Ranma appeared inside the<br/>restaurant, Shampoo and Mousse were almost knocked off of their feet<br/>by the resulting winds as the pigtailed boy burst through the front<br/>door and landed in the middle of the room.<p>"Where is Akane?" he said firmly as he glared at the trio of<br/>Chinese carefully.<p>"Pardon? Whom do you mean?" said Cologne as she feigned ignorance.<p>"Old woman, I know she was in here, and I know something<br/>happened," said the boy calmly as he narrowed his eyes at her for a<br/>moment.<p>"How would you know that?" said Cologne, with her tone changing<br/>again. She almost seemed to be mocking him now.<p>"I felt her ki inside here, and it dropped off suddenly. I also<br/>know it wasn't you that did this, but someone who was here," said<br/>Ranma. "Are you going to tell me what happened or not?"<p>Shampoo decided to speak up. "Peoples from Musk take girl away."<p>Cologne whirled around and stared at her Great Granddaughter for a<br/>moment, she remained silent though.<p>"Musk?" asked Ranma.<p>"Very strong warrior from China," explained Shampoo. "Ranma not<br/>have easy time beating. They take Akane as wife for leader."<p>"What? Where did they go?" said Ranma as his eyes went wide.<p>"Shampoo not know, they no say," said the Amazon with a shrug.<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes and turned to look out the door. "Never<br/>mind, I've found them." With that, he blasted away.<p>Cologne glared at Shampoo for a moment, her brow furrowing.<p>"Great Grandmother only make Ranma angry. She no beat him like<br/>plan, let Musk do work for us. Shampoo not think he strong enough to<br/>beat Ranma," explained the girl.<p>"You're a fool child," said Cologne angrily. "You may have just<br/>cost us that boy. I would have been able to hold him here, and after<br/>the Prince of the Musk had forced the girl to China with him, it would<br/>have been too late."<p>"Great Grandmother have much pride. She think she hold Ranma, even<br/>after she defeated by him? Maybe Great Grandmother give kiss of<br/>marriage?"<p>"Wh-What?" stuttered Cologne in shock. Shampoo had never spoken to<br/>any elder like that before. "You had better learn your place child..."<br/>Her voice had gone into a, very dangerous sounding, warning tone.<p>"Musk not hold Akane Tendo long, he not know how strong is. Plan<br/>is foolish," insisted the girl as she sat down. "Maybe he get lucky<br/>and kill girl before Ranma find?"<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at the girl for a moment and turned<br/>away. She hopped towards the kitchen and turned back to face her Great<br/>Granddaughter. "We'll see child."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo slowly opened her eyes; she groaned for a moment and<br/>looked around. A large scowl formed on her face as she found herself<br/>hanging over the shoulder of some strange man, her hands and ankles<br/>were tied at the wrist with a rather flimsy looking rope.<p>"So, she is awake," said Herb as he glanced over his shoulder and<br/>smirked. "I do hope you enjoyed our date, now that we've done that, we<br/>can get married. Don't bother pretending that you're still out by the<br/>way."<p>"Date?" muttered Akane. "What are you talking about? Let me go,<br/>right now!"<p>"I'm afraid not, you are Ranma Saotome's fiancee, yes?" said Herb<br/>calmly.<p>"What? Who are you? How do you know Ranma?" said the girl in<br/>shock.<p>"Ah, then it is true. This is very simple then; he destroyed our<br/>sacred springs, so we're taking you as compensation. Isn't that nice?"<br/>said the man with a small chuckle.<p>A few feet back, Lime and Mint watched Akane closely. "So, this is<br/>a girl? Lord Herb must be doing very well, he's already talking about<br/>marriage!" said Lime cheerfully.<p>"Right, it'll be nice to have a girl around. Do you think she'll<br/>let us touch her titties?" asked Mint.<p>"I don't see why not," replied Lime with a shrug.<p>"Hey, what's she doing?" muttered Mint as he looked at the girl on<br/>Herb's back easily snap the ropes they had used to bind her hands.<p>"You let me go right now!" screamed Akane as she pushed herself<br/>off of the man's back and flipped in the air, landing nearby.<p>"I've explained this to you already. You don't have a choice,"<br/>said Herb with a frown as he watched her. She had taken up a combat<br/>stance and was glaring at him angrily. "You can come with us now, or<br/>I'll just beat you up again and take you."<p>"You caught me by surprise before! It won't happen again," snarled<br/>Akane as she glared at him.<p>"You actually think you can beat me?" said the man in surprise as<br/>he chuckled to himself for a moment.<p>Akane growled at this and stepped back a bit. "Come on."<p>"How amusing," said Herb as his smile changed into a frown in an<br/>instant. "I'll even give you the first strike." Herb's smile returned<br/>again, it was obvious that he didn't feel threatened at all.<p>"Um...Lord Herb..." muttered Lime as he stepped forward and<br/>watched the girl nervously for a moment.<p>"Stay out of this," replied the man firmly.<p>Lime stepped back with a nervous look about him, but did not say<br/>anything more.<p>"Fine!" screamed Akane as she spread her arms and began to build<br/>up power.<p>Herb's face fell slightly and his posture became slightly<br/>uncertain. "What the..." He careened across the street, slamming into<br/>a wall as the girl blasted forward, slamming her fist into his face.<br/>The brick surface shattered under the impact, burying Herb under a<br/>pile of debris.<p>"So, who's next?" snorted Akane as she turned towards the other<br/>two.<p>"Lord Herb!" cried Mint in alarm.<p>Akane's victorious smile vanished in an instant, as she seemed to<br/>feel something. She whirled around and stared at the pile of rubble in<br/>disbelief. "No way!"<p>"You're stronger than you look," said Herb as he stood up and<br/>began to dust himself off absently. "I wasn't expecting a punch like<br/>that from a normal human. Quite impressive."<p>Akane growled and took up a closed looking stance, her hands were<br/>tucked away at her side, and she simply glared at Herb.<p>"Well girl, are you going to fire that blast or not?" said Herb<br/>with a chuckle.<p>"Laugh this off! Kamehameha!" cried Akane as she thrust her hands<br/>forward.<p>Herb sidestepped the attack rather easily, and rushed forward<br/>again. Before she could react, he had his fist in her gut. "You'll<br/>soon learn your place."<p>"Bastard," muttered Akane weakly as she staggered for a moment. "I<br/>won't lose."<p>Herb's eyes went wide in surprise as she grabbed him while he<br/>stood with his fist still pushing against her gut. "What?"<p>"You don't think, a punch like that is enough to finish me do<br/>you?" snarled Akane as she lifted him into the air and suplexed him on<br/>the ground.<p>Herb groaned for a moment and staggered to his feet. He glared at<br/>Akane for a moment, as she stood opposite him in an offensive stance.<br/>"How? She's still gaining power? How can this be? No human should be<br/>this strong!"<p>"Surprised?" said the girl in response to his words.<p>"Very, I wasn't expecting to find someone like you here," said<br/>Herb with a small chuckle. "You surprised me, but you're still not<br/>enough to beat me."<p>"There's no way I'll let you kidnap me," said Akane firmly.<p>"The sacred springs must be avenged. If I can't have you, I'll<br/>destroy you," said Herb coldly.<p>"Just try it!" snarled Akane as she rushed forward.<p>"Pathetic!" snapped Herb as he jumped up into the air over her<br/>strikes. He came down behind her and she spun into a kick.<p>Herb smiled and put up his hand, a blast of energy slammed into<br/>her, sending her flying away and into a wall. The effect was the same<br/>as when she had done the same to him, and she stood up from the<br/>debris.<p>"You'll pay for that! Kamehameha!" snarled the girl as she blasted<br/>him with another wave of energy.<p>Herb put up his hand again and returned the blast almost casually.<br/>"Heh, I am descended from the dragons, there is no chi attack you can<br/>use against me that I do not already know." The two beams of energy<br/>slammed into one another and locked.<p>Akane grit her teeth and kept up her beam. "Damn you!" She pushed<br/>harder, forcing Herb's beam back a little.<p>"How annoying. Why don't you just give up?" he snapped as he<br/>returned with twice as much power. Akane's beam failed, and she took<br/>the brunt of his blast. She was thrown back into the wall again,<br/>crushing what was left in a small explosion. Herb smiled and looked<br/>into the dust for a moment, his grin failed as she began to move<br/>again, and stood up with a pained look on her face.<p>Akane was glaring at him angrily, her school uniform hung in<br/>tatters off of her body, still covering her for the most part.<br/>"Bastard. That hurt."<p>"Most impressive," commented Herb as he walked towards her again.<br/>"You're infinitely stronger than I had imagined, but your power is not<br/>enough to defeat me." He jumped into the air, and flew towards her,<br/>leaving a trail of chi energy behind him. Akane sucked in a quick<br/>breath as his attack rushed forward at an amazing rate of speed.<p>Lime and Mint looked on in awe as the attack created an even<br/>larger dust cloud than the destruction of the wall had. Neither one of<br/>them said a word as they watched the fight. Suddenly, Herb's voice cut<br/>through the silence after the blast.<p>"What? I missed?"<p>"Ha!" screamed Akane as she descended from above and slammed her<br/>fist into the back of his head. Herb was thrown forward, sprawling<br/>across the grass on the opposite side of the rubble.<p>The Musk Prince stood up and turned to face her. "Well, most<br/>impressive."<p>Akane was floating above the ground, still extended from her<br/>attack. She slowly pulled her arm back and smirked at him. "I'm just<br/>getting warmed up."<p>"I grow tired of this game, it ends now," said Herb as he floated<br/>up to meet her. "You're life is over little girl. I will have my<br/>revenge."<p>Akane glared at him as he began to pull energy from the air.<br/>"What?"<p>"You should feel honored, you're the first to ever taste my final<br/>attack! Spirit of the Dragon's horn!" cried Herb as he thrust his<br/>hands forward. A spike of yellow energy shot forward, it was about<br/>five feet long and tore the ground up as it passed over it. Akane<br/>could not dodge the blast and crossed her arms in the hope of<br/>lessening the blow somewhat. It was clear she would probably not<br/>survive.<p>"No! Ranma, I'm sorry!" she managed right before the light<br/>engulfed her. Her eyes squeezed shut, and she braced herself.<p>"No!" cried a familiar voice. Akane felt something slam into her<br/>side, and blinked in surprise for a moment. She was still alive.<br/>Someone had shoved her out of the way at the last moment.<p>"Ranma?" she said as she looked at the figure who was lying on the<br/>ground beside her, his body was smoking, and his eyes were closed<br/>tightly as he grit his teeth in pain. "Ryoga?" she sputtered in<br/>surprise.<p>"Damn, that hurt," grumbled the lost boy as he slowly rose to his<br/>feet. His hand was clutched against his side and he was clearly<br/>bleeding from a wound present there. He fell down to one knee,<br/>breathing heavily. "Damn it."<p>"Ryoga! Are you...all right?" gasped Akane as she moved down to<br/>his side.<p>"Do I look all right to you tomboy?" snapped the boy as he glared<br/>at Herb. "Who the hell is this guy? What's going on?"<p>"Shut up! You're hurt!" snapped Akane.<p>"I noticed," commented Ryoga as he flashed her a quick glance.<p>"You shouldn't have interfered," said Herb coldly.<p>"Sorry, I owe her a favor," said Ryoga with a small chuckle.<p>"I don't care about you, stay out of this and you might survive,"<br/>said Herb as he flashed a quick glance at Akane.<p>"Can't do that pal," said Ryoga as he slowly rose to his feet<br/>again.<p>"I don't need your help!" snapped Akane, as she seemed to remember<br/>something suddenly. She punched Ryoga in the back of his head, sending<br/>him down to the ground again.<p>"Ouch! Uncute little," muttered the boy painfully.<p>"You won't escape me this time," said Herb as he began to charge<br/>his power again.<p>"Fat chance!" snarled Akane as she rushed forward, putting him on<br/>the defensive.<p>Herb backed away, dodging around her punches and kicks fluidly. He<br/>was steadily gaining power as he did so and smiled at her.<p>"I won't let you!" cried Akane as she thrust her hands forward. A<br/>Kamehameha wave blasted the man in his chest at point blank range.<br/>Herb grit his teeth and was thrown into the air again. He righted<br/>himself in midair, and spun around to glare at her from above.<p>"You'll pay for that," he seethed.<p>"Come and get me!" snarled Akane as she blasted up towards him.<p>Herb smiled, the energy blast had caught him off guard, but it<br/>hadn't stopped him from charging his own power. "Spirit of the<br/>Dragon's Horn!"<p>Akane shifted, attempting to move out of the way. Her face became<br/>a mask of surprise again; she hadn't expected him to be able to pull<br/>the move off with her pressing her attack the way she had been. "No!"<br/>she cried in shock as she put her arms up defensively.<p>She felt the shock wave slam into her body, and a wave of burning pain<br/>raced up her arm. She plummeted down to the ground and hit hard,<br/>bouncing once before finally coming to a stop next to a large crater.<p>She slowly opened her eyes and clutched at her arm. "What? He<br/>missed?" There was a large gash cut into the side of her upper arm,<br/>and a four-foot crater on the ground beside her. She looked up to see<br/>Herb turned away from her with a look of anger on his face.<p>"Who would dare?" snarled the man angrily as he whirled around;<br/>there was a large red mark on the side of his face.<p>Ranma floated in the air beside him, a scowl burned onto his<br/>features. The blue aura of power burned around him and his body was<br/>much more muscular than normal. He popped his knuckles and stared Herb<br/>down.<p>"You shouldn't have done that."<p>"Who are you?" said Herb as his aura flared up around him as well.<br/>He had suddenly grown very cautious.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts,<br/>and the Kame Sennin School. You hurt my friends, and now I'm going to<br/>hurt you."<p>"Well, you're the man I was looking for in the first place," said<br/>Herb coolly. "For the sin of destroying the Sacred Springs, you will<br/>die."<p>"What?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"You and your friends are stronger than you look," commented Herb<br/>casually as he threw his cape down to the ground below. "I am Herb,<br/>lord of the forgotten tribe of the Musk, last surviving member of it's<br/>rulers, and descendant of the dragon."<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed as he noticed there was something unusual<br/>about the man. His eyes were a golden yellow, and were slit like those<br/>of a serpent, and his chest, although mostly human, had a few serpent<br/>like scales visible on it. A slight smirk formed on his face as his<br/>fists clenched involuntarily. "You look strong, this should be a good<br/>fight."<p>"Indeed," agreed Herb as he eyed Ranma with a similar look of<br/>hunger in his eyes.<p>Ranma looked down at Ryoga and Akane for a moment and frowned. The<br/>girl was eyeing the dragon-man angrily. "We'll take this someplace<br/>else, away from people who aren't involved. You said you're here for<br/>me, right?"<p>"I'll take care of that one later," commented Herb as he glanced<br/>down at Akane for a moment. "But it wouldn't do to destroy this lovely<br/>city. I shall follow."<p>Ranma nodded and turned towards Akane. "Take Ryoga to Dr. Tofu's,<br/>and stay out of the way."<p>"Why should I?" snarled Akane as she glanced down at the lost boy<br/>for a moment.<p>"You don't have too, but this is my fight. So don't follow us,"<br/>said Ranma as he looked back towards Herb.<p>"You two will go back to the Amazons and wait, I'll meet with you<br/>later," agreed Herb as he watched Ranma coldly.<p>"Lord Herb!" cried Mint in alarm.<p>"Come on," said Lime as he put his hand on the younger boy's<br/>shoulder. "Lord Herb knows what he's doing."<p>The wolf-boy nodded and reluctantly turned away.<p>Akane ignored them and lifted Ryoga over her shoulder. "Come on<br/>you oaf. I might as well help you."<p>"Hey! That hurts," said Ryoga weakly as she handled him roughly.<p>"Shut up or I'll just leave you here!" she snapped.<p>Ranma and Herb watched the group disperse and then shot across the<br/>sky, after one another.<p>+++++++++<p>"So, Herb asked you to remain here and wait?" said Cologne as she<br/>eyed the two youths suspiciously.<p>"That's right," said Lime with a small nod.<p>"Very well, I shall allow it," said Cologne as she sat down at one<br/>of the tables. "You might as well make yourselves useful though. Take<br/>one of those rags and start cleaning."<p>The pair looked at one another and blinked.<p>"Um, is your Great Granddaughter here?" asked Mint as he hefted a<br/>mallet over his shoulder. "We'd like to see what it's like to have tea<br/>with a girl."<p>Cologne sighed and rolled her eyes. "I'm afraid not. She's gone<br/>off to do some training with Mousse. They won't be back for a week."<br/>She narrowed her eyes at them for a moment. "And don't get any ideas<br/>about me either."<p>Both of the teens went pale and simply stared at her in shock.<p>"You mean..." said Mint with a sickly look on his face.<p>"You're a woman?" finished Lime with an equal amount of disgust.<p>Within seconds, both boys were on the ground with large lumps on<br/>their heads. Cologne merely sat at the table calmly, sipping her tea.<br/>She had hoped that Herb would take her advice, and eliminated the<br/>Tendo girl, thus removing Shampoo's only obstacle to the son-in-law.<br/>Unfortunately, things had gotten out of hand, and it seemed that the<br/>boy was lost to her now.<p>It wasn't something she was particularly upset with. Shampoo had<br/>become increasingly belligerent since he had managed to avoid being<br/>defeated by her so far. That was why she had sent the girl away to<br/>train. Perhaps the Bakusai Tenketsu would teach the girl a little more<br/>respect. She would see how difficult the techniques she was learning<br/>really were.<p>"Still, I need to think of a way to get that girl back on track,"<br/>muttered the old woman to herself. "If things go on the way they are,<br/>the breaking point may only be a temporary fix."<p>+++++++++++<p>"Shampoo! No! You'll be killed!" cried Mousse as he struggled<br/>against the steel cable that was binding him to the tree.<p>"Mousse be quiet now. Shampoo must train," said the girl sternly<br/>as she looked at her handiwork.<p>The pair were out in the middle of a field, Cologne had sent her<br/>away immediately after Ranma had left them. Now, she pulled herself up<br/>into the harness that would be used to train her in the technique.<p>"Breaking point technique not enough, not with Turtle Shell Girl.<br/>Shampoo must train harder," said the girl out loud as she stared down<br/>the steel wreaking ball that hung in front of her.<p>Mousse had had it hidden somewhere inside his robes, she didn't<br/>ask how he had gotten his hands on it. He had attempted to stop her<br/>immediately after realizing what she had wanted it for. She beat him<br/>easily, and tied him to the tree with some of the excess cable. She<br/>had briefly considered using the same cable that the ball was hanging<br/>from, but the weight would probably have cut him in half, so she<br/>decided against it in the end, after much deliberation.<p>It had been a chore to get the thing to hang from the tree at all.<br/>It had taken several broken branches to find the right one. Plus, she<br/>had to pull it up without Mousse's help. Now she was ready.<p>"Shampoo not lose!"<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane frowned, as Tofu looked Ryoga up and down. The man frowned<br/>and applied a bandage to his side.<p>"It's a nasty wound," commented the doctor. "I had to cut away a<br/>lot of the burnt tissue so it would heal. It didn't hit anything<br/>important though."<p>"Great," muttered Ryoga painfully.<p>"The wound was bad, but not life threatening," said Tofu<br/>cheerfully. "You're going to have to take it easy for a while I'm<br/>afraid."<p>Akane turned up her nose at this, but remained silent.<p>"Yeah, thanks I guess," muttered Ryoga as he turned his head away<br/>from her as well.<p>"The wound seemed aggravated though. Like someone had been jerking<br/>it around or something. It had been handled rather roughly," said the<br/>doctor as he took a few notes on a clipboard.<p>Akane turned red suddenly.<p>"I wonder who would treat an injured man in such a way," said Tofu<br/>with a small frown.<p>"I know," deadpanned Ryoga coolly. "Whoever it was, had to be a<br/>vicious thug to do something like that to such a helpless guy like<br/>me."<p>"Well, I wouldn't go that far..." commented Tofu with a smirk.<p>"Shut up! I helped you didn't I?" snarled Akane as she whirled<br/>around and glared at Ryoga.<p>"Sort of," muttered the boy dejectedly.<p>"I could have just left you there you know," grumbled Akane<br/>bitterly.<p>"Now, now, don't get upset," said Tofu as he stood up and put his<br/>clipboard under his arm. "Come on Akane, we've got to let him get some<br/>rest."<p>"Jerk," snorted the girl as she stomped away.<p>"Tomboy!" retorted Ryoga weakly as he watched the pair leave.<p>++++++++++<p>Tofu pulled Akane aside outside the office and grabbed her by the<br/>shoulders. "Akane. Who is this boy? Where did you find him?"<p>The girl looked at the ground for a moment. "He's...a friend of<br/>Ranma's."<p>"I'll have to ask him about it then," said Tofu with a thoughtful<br/>frown.<p>"About what?" said Akane in confusion.<p>"Akane, that boy in there. He's not human."<p>"What?" said Akane in shock.<p>++++++++++<p>"This should be far enough," said Ranma as he hovered over a large<br/>forest that rested deep in the mountains.<p>"Very well," agreed Herb from directly behind him. "Are you<br/>ready?"<p>"What's this about? I don't know you," asked Ranma as he stared<br/>the man down. "Why did you attack my friends?"<p>"This is your punishment," said Herb calmly. Thunder crashed in<br/>the distance as a dark sky slowly rolled over them from above.<p>"My, punishment?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"You destroyed the sacred springs of Jusenkyo, and the penalty for<br/>this crime is death. I was going to just let you off and take your<br/>woman as my own instead, but she didn't care for the idea. I think<br/>I'll just kill the both of you as retribution for the destruction of<br/>the springs."<p>"Jusenkyo?" muttered Ranma in shock. He closed his eyes and<br/>snorted. "I might have taken the punishment if it was just me, but for<br/>hurting my friends, I'm afraid I can't let you win."<p>"You have no choice," said Herb with a cold smirk on his face.<p>"We'll see," said Ranma as he prepared himself. The thunder boomed<br/>across the valley below once again, and the pair finally faced off.<p>++++++++++++<p>You had to know this was coming. TBC...<p>
