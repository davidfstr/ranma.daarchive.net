</div>I'm bringing this fic out of my dusty projects bin due to sheer reader requests. I was planing on finishing it up after I finished a few other things first, but I guess I can squeeze it in from now on. I'm also continuing 'The Teacher' again for the same reason, that one should be up tomorrow night sometime.<p>Ranma 1/2<p>A Saiyan Tail<p>Part 13<p>Training.<p>Soun and Goku landed on the Turtle Hermit's island and glanced around. The two men had a serious look on their faces as they searched for their old masters. "Kame Senin?" called Goku.<p>"What is it boys?" said the old bald man who emerged from the house. He had a turtle shell on his back and was wearing a pair of sunglasses.<p>"Master!" cried Soun.<p>Happosai removed his shades and blinked in surprise. "Soun? What are you two idiots doing here?"<p>"It's been a while since we've seen one another Master!" said the man respectfully.<p>Goku smiled at the reunion and walked up to the old man. "Master Roshi called us here, he said it was urgent."<p>"Urgent?" the little man seemed confused. "I haven't heard anything like that."<p>Suddenly another old bald man rushed from the house dressed in the same manner as Happosai. "Goku! It's good to see you!"<p>"What's up Master? Why did you call us?" said the Saiyan with a confused look on his face.<p>"Actually, I just wanted to see if this belonged to you," Kame Senin held up a familiar figure clutching a bokuten in his hands. He was covered in bruises and muttering to himself. "Dang fool came her demanding that I train him or something, I couldn't really understand him that well. I called Yamcha cause he sounds like he might be a relative of his or something. Anyway, I refused him and he went on some damned fool rant, something about paying any amount or something. He did mention your son and Tendo's daughter, so I thought maybe you knew him."<p>"This is the urgent business?" said Goku in shock.<p>"Urgent? I tried to tell you over the phone, but Tendo demanded that you come in person. I didn't expect you to come all the way here," replied the man with a shrug.<p>"Tendo?" said Goku in confusion.<p>"I just wanted Akane and Ranma to spend a little time together alone, you know, with out us," admitted the man with a shrug.<p>"Oh," said Goku still uncertain.<p>Akane huffed as the weight of the turtle shell pulled her down after another grueling day of delivering newspapers. The pair stood at the top of a hill overlooking Nerima. "What now?" she muttered as Ranma jogged up next to her with his traveling pack on.<p>"It's time to weed the gardens," said Ranma with a smile. It was a weekend and they had no school that day. "We're gonna start doing it every afternoon now."<p>"We don't have a garden!" snapped Akane.<p>Ranma waved his hands at the street below. "Nope, but they do."<p>Akane's eyes went wide as she realized that hundreds of the houses below had small gardens in them. "All of them?"<p>"Of course," replied the pigtailed boy with a small smirk.<p>Moments later Akane was on her hands and knees and covered in dirt. "I don't even get any tools?"<p>"Nope, make sure you get the roots out too, and don't hurt any of the plants," instructed Ranma.<p>"How am I supposed to get the roots out without a shovel?" snapped Akane bitterly.<p>The pigtailed boy squat down next to her and shot his hand under the ground just beside a particularly large weed. He brought his hand up and dangled the weed in front of her face for a moment. "Like that. Get started."<p>Kasumi smiled as her sister collapsed on the ground just in front of the kitchen door. "Oh, hello Akane! How was your day?"<p>"I'm starving Kasumi! When's dinner!" said the girl with a weary and desperate hunger in her voice.<p>"Oh, I didn't see you there Ran-" The elder girl blinked when she noticed that the Saotome boy was not standing there. "Oh my."<p>The sound of the door followed shortly as Ranma entered the home. "Tameda!"<p>Kasumi blushed and turned back towards the meal hoping Akane hadn't noticed her slip up.<p>Ryoga Hibiki floated in the air and stared at his opponent angrily. His body was covered in small burns and scars. A vicious snarl was planted on his lips as well as he simply waited. "Where?"<p>"Haaaaaa!" cried a familiar voice from somewhere around the lost boy. Ryoga shifted to the side just in time to see a green blur pass within an inch of his face. He seemed to vanish as Piccolo reappeared in front of his position with his arm still extended in a punch.<br/>Ryoga appeared just above him in a downward kick that passed through the demon's body. The lost boy gasped in shock and turned with his arms crossed just in time to block the blow that the green man landed on his forearms. He was pushed back slightly and grunted in effort.<p>Ryoga wasn't through yet, he charged up a blast and uncrossed his arms sending a wave of energy at the Namek that burned the tips of his shoes as he shot upwards to avoid it. Piccolo gasped as Ryoga appeared directly in front of him with is fist extended to his nose.<p>"Got you!" snarled the boy triumphantly.<p>"Good!" snapped Piccolo as he appeared nearby floating in the air.<p>Ryoga gasped as he realized that the Piccolo in front of him had already faded away. "How?"<p>"There isn't anything else I can really teach you boy," said the green man ignoring the question. "If you're ever going to be ready to face Ranma Saotome, now is the time." The Namek had been training with the Hibiki boy nonstop over the past few weeks. The lost boy had vanished for a few days during that time and picked a few fights while looking for the boy. Piccolo had always managed to find him and get him back on track again.<p>"I was ready for Ranma before I met you," replied the boy a little arrogantly.<p>"That's all well and good, but I want to be sure you're good enough to keep that brat busy while I take care of his old man. Even I'm not strong enough to take them both on," replied the demon calmly. "I don't really care if you beat him or not."<br/>Piccolo smiled to himself as he said this. "And then I'll have those dragon balls to myself. I'll just kill you to make sure I don't have any loose ends boy," thought the demon to himself.<p>"When are we going to fight Ranma?" asked Ryoga coolly, his tail wagged slowly behind him and he clenched his fists in anticipation.<p>"Soon enough, have patience boy," snorted the Namek.<p>Ryoga nodded grimly and slowly floated back to the ground. Piccolo was his best chance of finding Ranma again soon. He would just have to wait until the demon led him to the boy.<p>"You should loosen up more," said Ranma cheerfully as he rubbed on Akane's shoulders in the dojo.<p>Akane was sitting in front of him looking dejected. It had taken him half an hour to get her to agree to a rub down to loosen her up a bit. She was so cramped that she needed it badly. "Ha ha, very funny," she replied snidely.<p>"It was meant to be," he said with a shrug. There was a slight rain outside and he sighed.<p>"Ranma, why are you helping me?" she asked suddenly.<p>"Huh? Cause Pop asked me too. Why?" said the boy in confusion.<p>"Is that the only reason?" she pried farther.<p>"Naw, I like you Akane, you're a good friend!" said the boy happily. He continued to rub her shoulders cheerfully.<p>"Friend?" Akane was uncertain about the word. They were engaged to be married, but she wasn't sure how she felt about him. "At least one of us is sure," she muttered under her breath.<p>Ranma gave her a small quizzical look, but said nothing.<p>Shampoo stared at the ground in frustration as she paced around the mysterious girl's tracks. The trail was long since cold and she had nothing to go on any longer. Her frustration was growing with each passing moment and she was still unsure of what to do. "Shampoo no can go home until Ranma come with her," she reminded herself out loud. The rules were the same whether she hunted a husband or a wife.<p>She looked up at the sky and frowned at the forecast, it would certainly rain all day tomorrow as well. Unfortunately that would make tracking the girl even harder in these harsh conditions. Surely the female Ranma would be much harder to find in the rain.<br/>She cursed in Mandarin and kicked a piece of pavement away sending it splashing through a large puddle that took up most of the street. She had spent a lot of time near the Tendo home, and sightings of the female Ranma were sparse and few there. When she did see her, the girl would be gone by the time she arrived, only the cowardly male Ranma and his girlfriend remained.<p>Despite the fact that she was a little uncomfortable with a lesbian relationship, she still felt proud of her prize. It was a hunt worthy of her talents, in the end it might prove to be too much for her. It seemed to her that the other girl was indeed of that persuasion, the way she reacted to her advances suggested that. Unfortunately for her she was also shy, and very difficult to catch. The poor girl was still in denial, probably forced opinions from the barbaric government system of the Japanese. It was up to her to free her from such inhibitions, whether she wanted too or not.<p>Ranma had proven herself cunning prey indeed, and very resourceful. It was the greatest hunt of her life. Perhaps a bit too much, she was skeptical of her ability to make even a sighting of her beloved the next day.<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on your view of things, Shampoo was wrong. Early the next morning Ranma Saotome would wake up, and take Akane Tendo on a morning paper route that would send them from one end of Nerima to another, in the cool, wet, rain.<p>TBC...<p>As before the rest of this tale can be found on my site. .com/Misatira/<p>C&amp;C to<p>
