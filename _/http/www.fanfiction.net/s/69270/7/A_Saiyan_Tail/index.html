</div>A Saiyan Tail.<p>Part 18<p>A threat from China?<p>+++++++++<p>Deep in the Mountains of China, near the remains of a once cursed spring, now nothing more than a tranquil lake.<p>"Who are you?" said the guide with terror written across his face as the beast stood in his doorway.<p>The thing slowly stalked forward, its hooves clacking against the wooden floor as it stalked forward. It reached across the cowering form of the guide and grabbed the brewing teakettle off of the stove with its massive hands. After pouring the contents over its head, the body of the beast slowly melted away, leaving a Chinese boy standing in his broken doorway.<p>"I'm looking for Jusenkyo. I know it's near here," he said to the whimpering man on the floor. "I've been searching for weeks now, but I can't find it. I need directions."<p>"I'm sorry, but that lake outside is all that remains of Jusenkyo!" cried the man in panic.<p>"I see," replied the boy as he narrowed his eyes and glanced back at the water. "Are you the guide?"<p>"No, I was the guide. I've retired; there is no more Jusenkyo, so it doesn't need a guide. What do you want from me?" said the man as he calmed slightly.<p>"The registry," replied the boy darkly.<p>"Oh, I'll get it," said the man cheerfully as he jumped up.<p>"Huh?" muttered the Chinese boy in surprise.<p>"Why do you look so surprised? I've got no use for it anymore," said the man as he dug through an old looking chest. "Now where did I put that... Oh yes! Here it is!" He handed it over and bowed. "What do you need it for? If I might ask."<p>"I'm looking for a man, someone I know came here," replied the boy as he turned away.<p>"I know you! I remember now! That was many years ago, I almost didn't recognize your curse! You were so young then!"<p>The boy paused and glanced back at the man. "You know who that man was?"<p>"No, I'm sorry. There were many guests that came here over time."<p>"I see. You have my thanks," said the boy as he walked out the door and left.<p>"Oh great, now I need to fix the door," grumbled the ex-guide under his breath as he looked at the broken frame.<p>Outside, the Chinese boy looked down at the book in his hands and flipped through the pages. "Damn! There are hundreds of names in here! This could take a while." He sighed and hung his head; at least most of them were Chinese.<p>++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome was having a good day. Things had gone well over the past week or so. It had been relatively quiet, and Akane had calmed down after the ordeal with Ryoga had ended. Piccolo seemed to go into training as well, he knew the demon would not be seen for some time yet.<p>Akane was jogging along beside him with a huge backpack hanging from her shoulders, and there was no school that day. Things couldn't be better really.<p>"Hey, son! Wait up!" cried his father as he jogged up behind them with a wide grin on his face. "You've done a real good job of keeping up Akane's training for me."<p>"Thanks, Pop!" said the boy proudly.<p>A new voice cut through the air, causing all of them to pause. "Aiya!"<p>Ranma looked down on the street to see Shampoo staring up at him nervously. "Hey! It's Shampoo! How's it goin?" cried the pigtailed boy cheerfully.<p>"This is the one you told me of?" said the figure standing beside her. She was a wizened old crone balancing on a staff precariously.<p>"Who's your friend?" said Akane as she jogged up beside the young Amazon.<p>"H-hello," muttered the girl nervously as she eyed the trio. "This is Shampoo Great Grandmother. Her name Cologne."<p>The old woman narrowed her eyes at the girl for a moment and said nothing, but bowed politely to the trio of fighters. "My Great Granddaughter has told me of you in her letters. I must admit she's exaggerated a bit, but you seem to be everything she has said."<p>"She wrote about us?" said Ranma in confusion. "I wonder why?"<p>"Is she visiting you?" said Akane as she spoke to the Chinese girl politely.<p>"Yes, but with reason," muttered the girl in embarrassment as she backed away from her.<p>"Yes, I am here to help Shampoo acquire her bride. It seems that she has failed thus far," commented the old woman as she eyed the three of them for a moment.<p>Ranma gulped nervously and laughed. "Oh, is that all? Good luck Shampoo." He started jogging away cheerfully.<p>"Yes, thank you. Surely two young bachelors like yourselves would understand," pried the old woman.<p>"Ha, ha! We're not bachelors," said Goku happily.<p>"Oh no?" prodded the old woman carefully.<p>"No, Ranma is my son. He's engaged to Akane," said the man proudly.<p>"Oh? You two must be quite happy," said the old woman to the young girl standing with her granddaughter.<p>"Well..." muttered Akane in embarrassment.<p>"Sure we are!" said Ranma cheerfully as he walked up to her. After a moment of jogging he realized that the others had not followed his lead and were still talking with the Chinese Amazons.<p>"Well, we've got to go. Training and all," said Goku as he waved to them.<p>"It is them indeed," said the old woman as she watched him go. "I wonder where your wife might be? I don't recall his son being there with him."<p>"They is very strong Great Grandmother," said Shampoo.<p>"So what? You disgust me. Quivering like a frightened rabbit," snorted the old woman.<p>"They is stronger than village elders," replied the girl carefully.<p>"Please, do not insult me Shampoo. They are but young pups, living in such a soft place as this. You were right to call me though; they are quite strong. Surely with fighters like these around, our women can find strong husbands indeed in this land."<p>"They strong enough to scare demon away," said the young girl.<p>"Demon? What would you know?" snorted the hag.<p>"Shampoo saw strange man with green skin. Like story times from child days. He very strong, but leave when boy Ranma and father face him."<p>"What?" snapped Cologne. "What did you just say to me? Choose your words carefully child. This is most important."<p>The girl winced under the old woman's gaze. "Shampoo say that, green demon man run away from boy Ranma and father. Bad man from village even beaten by him. Is much stronger than before."<p>"Demon? Surely you jest child! Such things do not exist!" snapped Cologne angrily. She turned away, and her angry face melted away.<p>"Shampoo see with own eyes," replied the girl quietly.<p>"Piccolo! It has to be! If these fighters are strong enough to ward him off, with only the two of them, they are powerful indeed." She hopped away and motioned for her great granddaughter to follow. "Come Shampoo. We are going into training again. You will not be so easily frightened again. Honestly child." She hated treating her this way, but she had to be taught who was really the strongest people in the world. After all, even the Amazons had managed to turn the demon away. Before they developed many of the powerful techniques they now possessed.<p>++++++++++++<p>Two days later, Ranma sat in the dojo with his father. They were both meditating with Akane floating in the air opposite them. All three of them were in the lotus position.<p>"You're getting better Akane. We've been like this for almost five minutes," said Goku cheerfully.<p>The girl immediately fell to the ground on her face. "Uh, thank you Sensei," she muttered as she pushed herself up.<p>"Come on Akane. You can't get distracted this way. I think you could have lasted a lot longer!" said Ranma as he offered her his hand and helped her to his feet.<p>The girl blushed. She knew it wasn't true, it was a hard struggle, even before Goku had said anything to her. She quickly shook her head and pushed his hand away. "What the hell am I thinking?" She stood up on her own and frowned at them. "I can take care of myself Ranma."<p>"Uh, okay," said the boy in confusion. "Did I do something wrong?"<p>"No. Don't worry about it," muttered the girl apologetically.<p>"Oh, okay!" Ranma cheerfully turned away from her and looked towards his father. "So, now what?"<p>"We're going on a trip in three days," said Goku cheerfully. "We'll be gone for a week."<p>"What about school?" gasped Akane.<p>"I think you can miss it. Your grades are good enough. Besides, I'll have your teachers send your assignments over for you," said Soun from behind his newspaper.<p>"I'll come pick them up for you. That way you can do them while we're there. Master Roshi said that being strong mentally was important too," said Goku cheerfully.<p>"All right," agreed Akane sternly.<p>"One more thing, we're going to fly there," said Goku flatly.<p>"What?" gasped Akane in shock.<p>"Don't worry Akane, you can do it!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"I can barely float three feet off the ground for five minutes!" snapped the girl in retort.<p>"Well, doing is the best way to learn," reasoned Goku.<p>"I... all right fine!" snapped the girl as she whirled around on her heels and looked at the ceiling. Arguing with these two was pointless, in the end she'd end up doing it anyway. At least they'd let her take off that stupid shell. Now she just lugged a backpack loaded with lead weights around when she was training instead. At least it wasn't all the time anymore.<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma appeared in front of the net and kicked the ball into the goal. The goalie had not even noticed the score until it was in there.<p>On the sidelines, the PhysEd coach was almost crying tears of joy. "Ok, that's Saotome 143, everyone else, two." Apparently, the boy was taking it easy on them today.<p>"Coach, can we stop now?" muttered one of the boys as he fell to the ground in front of him, covered in sweat and exhausted. The rest of the team, or should I say class, was in a similar condition all over the field.<p>"Shut up and get back in there!" snapped the man angrily.<p>The boy muttered angrily to himself as he crawled back out on the field. Ranma Saotome had single-handedly ensured that no one in the entire class would pass P.E. with more than a C. "If only something would happen that would end this torture!" he cried to the heavens. Fortunately, someone answered.<p>"Ranma Saotome! Prepare to die!" screamed a voice from across the field.<p>The pigtailed boy paused in mid kick and looked up at the sky a figure was spinning towards his position, tucked in a ball. He flipped across the field and landed lightly in front of him.<p>"Huh? Who the heck are you?" muttered Ranma in confusion.<p>"I am Mousse! I am the man who is to be Shampoo's groom!"<p>"Hey! That's great! Best o' luck to ya and stuff!" said the boy obliviously.<p>"I...Huh?" the boy stared at him in shock.<p>"Stupid Mousse! Not this Ranma! Girl type Ranma is Shampoo's beloved!" growled the purple haired Amazon as she appeared next to him and promptly decked him.<p>"Huh? Shampoo! You mean you...chose a woman over me?" he fell to his knees in tears.<p>"Hey. Tough luck pal," said one of the boys in the crowd that surrounded the group.<p>"Shampoo! I can be more feminine for you! Give me a chance!" cried Mousse as he fell to his knees. A small dust cloud formed and Mousse appeared in front of her wearing a frilly looking dress. A thick layer of makeup covered his face as well. Overall, he looked quite repulsive.<p>"AIYAH!" cried Shampoo as she punched him into the air in horror.<p>The boy landed roughly, dressed in his normal clothes once more. "Okay, so maybe I need a little work! I can do better! I can learn!" he prostrated himself in front of her again.<p>"Stupid Mousse never do that again!" screamed the girl as she kicked him in the head repeatedly while he was down.<p>"Man, I'm not hungry anymore," muttered Ranma as he held his stomach. He turned to the Amazon and smirked. "Uh, what are you doin here anyway?"<p>"Is still looking for Girl Ranma," said the girl with a sigh.<p>"Maybe you should just give up Shampoo. She doesn't like girls that way," muttered Ranma nervously.<p>"No! Shampoo never give up! Shampoo make Girl Ranma hers for sure!"<p>"Great," grumbled Ranma as he walked away from the scene.<p>"Yes, that girl is quite elusive," commented Cologne as she appeared in front of the boy.<p>"AUUGGHHH!" cried Ranma as he fell on his back clutching his chest. "I'll never eat again! Well, at least not for an hour or so."<p>"Do you know where we might find this girl?" said the old woman as she appeared over him.<p>"You can't, not right now anyway," muttered the boy as he stood up and jumped away from the scene.<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes as he rushed away. "He knows something..." A large sweat drop appeared on her head as her Great Granddaughter's cries of protest floated over to her.<p>"No! Stupid Mousse! Shampoo not want have hot lesbian sex with you!"<p>She slowly turned around and sighed as she saw the entire crowd of boys lying on the ground clutching at their noses. "At any rate, it is a mystery for another day."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Getting out of hand are they Ranma?" teased Akane.<p>"Why do you seem so happy about this Akane?" said the boy as he looked up at her.<p>"I just think it's funny that's all," she said with a shrug.<p>"Well, we're leaving in a couple of days or so. It'll be nice to get away from it all for a while. I'm just glad Shampoo hasn't been able to find me lately. If I can keep it up, maybe she'll just give up and go home."<p>"I hope so," muttered the girl as she poked at her lunch lazily.<p>"Pops is talking about more training. He doesn't think Piccolo is going to be gone for long this time. We gotta be ready."<p>Akane looked at him and smiled. "Do you think I'll be able to help?"<p>"I dunno Akane. He's real strong, but maybe. I mean, if you train real hard, and he doesn't come back too soon..." said the boy as he looked up at the sky. "It's always nice to have someone else around to help.<p>"I'll be glad too!" said the girl cheerfully.<p>Ranma glanced at her for a moment. She seemed so cheerful recently. He paused though, when he saw a tear trickle down her face. "Hey! What's wrong? Are you hurt?" said the boy as he jumped up beside her.<p>She looked at him and smiled. "No, it's nothing. I was just thinking about, Nabiki."<p>"Don't worry so much Akane! She'll be back, as good as new! You'll see."<p>"Right, but I still miss her, and we've got another six months to go still. I'm sorry Ranma, I didn't mean to upset you."<p>"Aw, don't worry about it. Pop says girls cry more than guys do anyway," said the boy obliviously.<p>Akane broke her chopsticks in half and glared at him. "What's that supposed to mean?"<p>"Huh? I dunno? All the girls I've known cry more than I do. I ain't real sure why. Do girls get sad easier or somethin? I don't cry when I'm a girl either though... boy, that sure is weird."<p>Akane blinked as she looked at him. He seemed totally oblivious to anything beyond what was important to him at times. She found herself laughing despite the fact that she wanted to be angry with him.<p>This seemed to upset and confuse him. "Hey! What did I say? I don't get it! What's so funny, Akane?"<p>"Don't worry Ranma, it isn't really important," said the girl with a sigh. She wiped the tears away from her eyes and sat back against the tree, just looking at the clouds above.<p>++++++++++<p>Shampoo was walking along the streets of Nerima with Mousse beside her. Once again she was on the hunt. The boy had been remarkably silent thus far, and simply followed closely behind her. The Amazon girl was not particularly worried about him though. She knew that her betrothed could take him any day of the week. It was the other shadow that worried her.<p>Finally, today the heavens had been kind to her. Standing with Akane Tendo, was Ranma Saotome, who had just been splashed by an old woman emptying out her bath water into the street.<p>"Aiya! Airen!" she squealed in delight as she bounded forward.<p>Cologne smirked as she followed closely behind the pair. "So, there she is. She is as I remember her. Surely a woman like that would be an asset to the tribe. Such power!"<p>+++++++++<p>"Man! I hate when this stuff happens," grumbled Ranma as she shook the water out of her hair.<p>"I guess you'll be taking a bath as soon as we get home," said Akane as she jogged ahead.<p>"Huh? Why bother?" muttered the girl obliviously. That was when she felt it. "Who?"<p>"I've found you at last! I shall free Shampoo from your sinful advances witch!" cried Mousse as he landed in front of her.<p>"Hey! You're that Mousse guy," said Ranma as she stood calmly and looked at him.<p>"I challenge you!" snapped the boy angrily.<p>"Hey! Great!" said Ranma with a huge grin appearing on her face.<p>"Very well! Take this villain!" cried the boy as he slashed at her with an uppercut of some sort.<p>"What the heck is this thing?" said Ranma as she stood on top of the training potty as the Chinese boy held it over his head.<p>"She dodged my strike?" thought Mousse in shock as he looked up at her. "She's good!"<p>Cologne jumped out from the shadows where she had been watching and stared at the scene openly now. No longer caring that the others knew she was there. "She is indeed skilled."<p>"Come on!" said Ranma as she jumped down and faced him again.<p>Mousse rushed forward and the girl bent and shifted around his blows easily and fluidly. He spun around with what appeared to be mere punches, but Cologne knew better. She was fast enough to see the weapons in his hands, and also, how easily the girl dodged him. She was exerting almost no effort in the battle at all.<p>"For one so young to gain such speed...Shampoo, you have truly done well this time. We must have her within the tribe. It is a pity that those males are already taken, but perhaps steps can be taken in that matter later on. After all, women are far from immortal. They could easily meet an accident or two, for the greater good of our tribe." she smiled darkly as a her plans began to take shape within the back of her mind.<p>Ranma spun in the air and landed on Mousse's head easily. "Hey! You ain't bad. Come on! Let's see what you've really got!" she cried as she floated in the air above him and got into a combat stance.<p>"What the?" cried Mousse in shock. He stumbled back and fell to the ground. He quickly pulled the thick lenses off his face and rubbed at them violently. "Stupid glasses!"<p>"Stupid Mousse. Shampoo tell you Ranma too too strong for you!" said the Amazon girl as she bounded up to them.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma as she turned to face the girl.<p>"Mousse already trying his hardest. He no beat you!" said the girl cheerfully as she bounced up and down excitedly. "Now you go to date with Shampoo? Yes?"<p>"Sorry, I uhh... got stuff to do today," muttered the airborne girl nervously. She floated up into the sky, leaving them standing around behind.<p>"Stupid Mousse scare Airen away!" snapped the girl as she took out her frustrations on the unfortunate boy.<p>"But Shampoo! Love like that isn't natural!" he cried desperately as he clung to her leg despite the beating.<p>Cologne had seen enough. She knew much of what the girl was capable of from the battle in Joketsuko. Her skills were much more than she had originally thought. However, from what she had seen here, the girl was still not match for her. "Do not concern yourself Shampoo. We shall have her if I have to drag her back personally."<p>"Aiya! Great Grandmother mean it?" squealed the girl excitedly.<p>"Yes, such a prize is too much to pass up," commented the old woman. Even if she wasn't of the persuasion she hoped she was, it was something the girl could easily learn to enjoy. Perhaps after she and Shampoo were married, she would also find a husband? Even the prince of the Musk could be submitted under her kind of power, with a little proper training that is."<p>++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki lay out across the grassy plains of America. He chewed lazily on a long piece of wheat as he watched the sky pass over his head. Life wasn't that bad for him recently. Since the weight of that girl's death had been lifted off of his shoulders slightly, he found himself actually enjoying some of the power he had now. He no longer searched the Earth for Ranma, he simply wandered around, pretty much doing as he pleased. There wasn't anyone who could really bother him anymore.<p>He stood up and stretched his arms for a moment. "It's so quiet here," he commented as he glanced around. He tended to enjoy the quiet of the wilderness more than the bustling cities of the world. It was easier to find too. There was no noise here, no people to irritate him, no worrying about using his power if he felt like it. Normal people were so fragile, he had learned that the hard way. He flew upward into the clouds and smirked.<p>"I've laid around enough. It's time to get started again." He clenched his fists at his sides. The clouds around him started to swirl around slowly, growing darker and darker as a sphere of energy formed around him. "Heh. I hope you're ready Ranma! I'm going to be a new man the next time we meet!" Thunder rumbled and slammed into his body, collecting on the surface of the sphere that surround him. His laughter seemed to drown out the booming thunder as it cracked around him.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Are we there yet?" said Akane as she floated along with Ranma and Goku on either side of her. They were carrying all of the supplies, but she was still struggling to keep up with them.<p>"Only an hour or two to go Akane," said Ranma cheerfully. In truth, he and his father could be there in a matter of minutes, but Akane wasn't training for speed. She just had to stay up for the trip.<p>"She's weakening. Come on son, we'd better land for a little while," said Goku as he felt her aura fluctuate.<p>"Right! Don't worry Akane, it just takes time," said the boy reassuringly to his fiancee.<p>Akane watched him float down below her and clenched her fist. "Why is he being so nice to me damn it? Why can't he act like a jerk like all the others! Damn you Ranma! I don't want to be in love with you!" She pushed the thoughts from her mind and concentrated on going down slowly.<p>+++++++++<p>"There, it is finished," said Cologne as Shampoo walked up to her with Mousse at her side. They were standing inside the restaurant they had just finished stocking and preparing for business.<p>"Aiya! Now Shampoo be with Airen for sure!" exclaimed the young girl excitedly.<p>"Yes dear. Why don't you go invite her over? We have much to do, but I'm sure she would like to see her wife's new restaurant."<p>"Is good idea!" exclaimed the girl.<p>"I think it's an awful idea," deadpanned Mousse.<p>"Nobody asked you!" snapped Cologne as she hit him over the head with her staff, before her Granddaughter could react. "Now get up! You've still got work to do! These tables need cleaning, and all the dishes have to be washed before we can use them! Go to it Mr. Part time!"<p>"Right," muttered the boy as he staggered away.<p>+++++++++<p>"Airen not here?" said Shampoo sadly.<p>"I'm afraid not, they all went on a training trip with my Akane," said Soun as he looked over his newspaper at her.<p>"Bad," snapped the girl in frustration.<p>"Don't worry, I'm sure they'll be back in a week or so. After all, Ranma and Akane are still in school," said Kasumi cheerfully.<p>Shampoo nodded and walked back out the hole in the wall she had created from her entrance. There was no point in making another, after all, her beloved wasn't around to be impressed with her strength.<p>On the way home, she decided that she could wait. After all, that girl Akane seemed quite set on the male Ranma, and seemed to be nothing more than friends with her beloved. She was also a strong woman, so she could be respected. When they returned, she could chase her beloved to her hearts content, if she could find her that is. She had to figure out how she managed to vanish that way.<p>In the end, it didn't matter. The Tendo's seemed to be pretty honest with her so far, and they said they didn't know where the group had gone to train. They had only said the mountains before they left. Soun had commented that they probably didn't really know where they were going themselves. Shampoo could accept that, after all, she had been on trips like that before.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Master! Surely this debauchery is fitting of a noble of my status. After all, one must spread his seed to ensure the strength and survival of the lower classes. However, I do not see the merit of peeping as training." Kuno stood outside of the women's bathhouse peering in the window with Happosai.<p>"You'll understand soon enough. The best part is when they jump up and down screaming. The true beauty of a curvaceous breast is when it is motion, activity such as running and jumping are art in itself upon the naked female form," said Happosai sagely.<p>"Ah! I see, so this is an exercise in culture and art!" said Kuno as he seemed to understand finally.<p>"So, you do get it!" agreed Happosai.<p>"Of course! There is no problem that the mental capacity of Tatewaki Kuno cannot handle! I just have one question master. How will we get them to jump and run as such? They are merely washing themselves."<p>"I'm glad you asked," said Happosai as he shoved the boy through the window. He put his face in his hands and grinned as the show began.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The Demon! Plus, more Amazon trickery.<p>
