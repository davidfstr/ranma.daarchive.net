</div>A Saiyan Tail<p>Part 23<p>Cologne's Revenge!<p>+++++++++<p>"The beach?" said Akane as she looked over at the two men and<br/>blinked.<p>"Yes, It has come to my attention, that Saotome has never been.<br/>Well, not in so many words. We did train on a tropical island, and<br/>have both had a few adventures in the ocean. We've just never, gone to<br/>the beach."<p>Goku blinked at him and shrugged his shoulders. "We never went<br/>just to have fun before. I thought you guys might like it, you've been<br/>training real hard."<p>"Oh my, how nice," commented Kasumi cheerfully. "Will we be taking<br/>the train? I suppose I should make lunch."<p>"Great!" chimed Ranma happily.<p>"Train?" asked Goku in confusion. "Why would we do that?"<p>+++++++++++<p>"Watch where you put your hands husband, there are children<br/>present," commented Nodoka from her husband's grip as they flew<br/>through the air with the children trailing behind them.<p>"Huh?" Goku looked down and saw that the hand he was holding her<br/>torso up with was a little higher than he had intended. "Oh, sorry."<p>"Now Saotome, please behave," agreed Soun as he carried Kasumi and<br/>pulled up next to him.<p>"Soun please," said Nodoka in embarrassment.<p>"Really father!" exclaimed Kasumi.<p>"Now, now," said Soun. "I was only joking, and my children are old<br/>enough to hear a little good natured ribbing now and then." Tears<br/>began to form in his eyes suddenly. "I only wish that my little Nabiki<br/>was here to see this!"<p>"Calm down Tendo," muttered Nodoka with a small sigh.<p>+++++++++++<p>Trailing just behind them, Akane and Ranma flew through the air<br/>easily, with two large packs full of beach gear and food.<p>"Honestly! Why do I get stuck with this stuff?" grumbled Akane<br/>irritably.<p>"Well, you're the one in training you know," said Ranma with a<br/>shrug. He had a good sized backpack on himself, loaded with towels,<br/>and the rest of the food. "And they've both been flying a lot longer<br/>than us, so it's just safer for them to carry the others."<p>"Yeah, I know, I'm not really mad," muttered Akane with a sigh.<br/>"Hey, Ranma..." she suddenly looked embarrassed.<p>"Huh? What's up Akane?" said the boy cheerfully.<p>"Do you think... you could help me with my swimming a little<br/>later? I still haven't really learned how. You're dad's been helping<br/>me, and I'm a little better now, but..."<p>"Huh? Why don't you just hold your breath and fly underwater?"<br/>said Ranma obliviously.<p>"Hold my breath?" Akane faltered in the air for a moment. "Why<br/>would I do that? Does it help?"<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma as he looked at her. "Akane, you can't<br/>breathe water. You have to hold your breath."<p>"I can't?" muttered the girl with a shocked look on her face.<p>"Um...no," said Ranma as he looked at her oddly for a moment.<p>"Oh," said the girl with a shrug. "What's this about flying<br/>underwater?"<p>"Huh? Oh, well..." Ranma thought about it for a moment. "You can<br/>do that too. Basically you just do it like you were in the air, and<br/>kick. It's easier to move around if you kick. If you do that, you can<br/>go a lot deeper than a normal person. Something about Chi protecting<br/>you from the pressure or something."<p>"Oh, that sounds easy enough," said Akane cheerfully.<p>Something about the situation made Ranma feel uneasy.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma sat back in one of the beach chairs they had brought along<br/>with them and sighed as she relaxed. She was dressed in a single piece<br/>bathing suit with the word 'boy' written across the chest in English.<br/>A pair of sunglasses rested across her nose and she stretched out<br/>completely, much to the anger of every girlfriend within forty yards<br/>of the scene. The fact that Kasumi Tendo was in a similar position<br/>right next to her didn't help matters any.<p>Nodoka sat nearby with Goku on a blanket and frowned slightly.<br/>"That isn't very manly." She was dressed in a conservative dark blue<br/>swimsuit herself, and rested with Soun under a large umbrella that was<br/>stuck into the sand.<p>"Huh? You worry too much dear," said the man cheerfully. "Ranma is<br/>fine." He went back to blowing up a beach ball obliviously.<p>"It doesn't bother you that our son is feminine?" she said in<br/>shock.<p>"Huh? Why not? He's a girl right now isn't he?" muttered the man<br/>obliviously as he finished his task and closed the valve.<p>"Goku!" snapped the woman in irritation.<p>"What? Akane doesn't seem to mind," muttered the man as he looked<br/>over and saw Soun's daughter had taken a spot right next to her<br/>fiancee on a beach towel. The pair was talking together cheerfully.<p>Nodoka sighed and hung her head. "I suppose you're right."<p>Goku blinked as he continued to dig through the backpack. "I know<br/>I put it in here..."<p>"What are you looking for?" said Nodoka as she looked over to the<br/>man.<p>"Aha!" said Goku as he pulled out a worn looking net.<p>"Oh dear," muttered Nodoka as she recognized the thing instantly.<p>"Hey Tendo!" called Goku as he jumped up.<p>"No, no, no! Can't we ever have a day of peace?" said his wife<br/>under her breath.<p>++++++++++<p>Soun was drinking a glass of iced tea, next to his eldest<br/>daughter. Guarding the trio of girls like a vigilant watchdog. He was<br/>dressed as Goku was, in a T-shirt and a loose pair of orange swimming<br/>trunks. The jealous glares of every woman on the beach seemed to be<br/>fixated on their area; as most of the male attention was focused on<br/>them, or on several other pretty girls in the immediate vicinity. It<br/>was the beach after all.<p>Counting Nodoka, the group was probably the largest concentration<br/>of such beauty on the beach, and naturally that was where the men<br/>tended to look.<p>"Hey Tendo!" called Goku as he jumped up from his place nearby and<br/>waved his arms.<p>Soun arched his eyebrow as he realized that his friend was waving<br/>something in the air. A worn looking volley ball.<p>"Saotome, did you bring the net?" asked the man with a sudden<br/>hunger in his voice.<p>Akane looked at the her father in shock. She had ever heard that<br/>tone from the man before.<p>"Yeah, too bad Kurillin and Yamcha aren't here," said Goku as he<br/>stopped in front of them and put the ball under his arm. "Master Roshi<br/>and Master Happosai, well... I doubt they'd play right now anyway..."<br/>Goku looked around at all the young girls on the beach and frowned<br/>slightly.<p>"Indeed, let's go Saotome!" Soun jumped up and started to set up<br/>the net.<p>Akane looked at Ranma after the scene had ended and noticed a<br/>small frown on the redhead's face.<p>Goku paused and looked over to them from where he was setting up<br/>the net. "Are you two coming?"<p>Ranma's frown suddenly changed into a sly looking grin. "Come on<br/>Akane."<p>"Huh?" muttered the girl as she looked at her fiancee for a<br/>moment.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Heh. Look, the old men think they can play ball," said one of a<br/>large group of boys who had gathered around the net. A few of them<br/>were hoping to steal the game away from the older men, after they had<br/>tired. A few girls had also gathered around, hoping to watch the<br/>younger boys play after the old men were finished.<p>Goku and Soun smirked and continued their work, finally finishing<br/>up the net and standing off to either side.<p>"Ready Tendo?" said Goku as he removed his shirt.<p>"Anytime Saotome!" agreed Soun as he did the same.<p>Any snide remarks the boys had stopped there. Both men had looked<br/>large before, but they were completely buff and would easily keep up<br/>with any one of the younger boys from the look of them.<p>It should also be noted, that the girls in the crowd were no<br/>longer waiting to watch the younger men play.<p>"Come on you two, we've got a game to play," said Goku over the<br/>crowd.<p>The mass parted as Akane Tendo, and Ranma Saotome in his female<br/>form walked calmly into the playing field.<p>"Hey! You need any more players?" called one of the boys. It was<br/>quickly accepted by most of the others. Several boyfriends were<br/>promptly decked, or otherwise injured, by their significant others.<p>"Stay back, or you'll get hurt," commented Ranma lazily as she<br/>took up a spot beside Soun.<p>"What's going on?" said Akane as she looked back and fourth at the<br/>two teams nervously. She had been expecting to be on a team with<br/>Ranma, against the two older men.<p>"Don't worry about it, just try and keep up. Okay?" said Goku<br/>cheerfully from beside her.<p>"Right!" said Ranma with a nod. "Are you ready to eat that ball<br/>old man?"<p>"That's the spirit son!" agreed Soun.<p>Three battle auras suddenly flared to life in the field. Akane<br/>seemed to catch on and steeled herself as hers flared to life as well.<p>Akane gasped as her father served the ball, it was covered in a<br/>blue aura and slammed into the ground in front of her, creating a<br/>small explosion. She jumped back and stared at the hole in shock.<br/>"What the?"<p>Gasps of shock and worried sounding mutters began to form in the<br/>surrounding crowd. A few of the boys who had offered to join the game<br/>suddenly went pale. One even passed out cold.<p>"I'll allow that one, since my daughter was not prepared Saotome,"<br/>said Soun with a small smile on his face.<p>"Come on Akane, I know you can do it!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>Akane looked at her father and frowned, as everything suddenly<br/>made sense. "All right, come on then!"<p>"That's the spirit Akane!" agreed Goku cheerfully. His face became<br/>serious a moment after that as he returned the ball.<p>"I knew she was my daughter!" agreed Soun as he caught it and<br/>readied himself again.<p>All the spectators suddenly moved back about ten feet from the<br/>edge of the field.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Men," muttered Nodoka as she watched the scene play out with<br/>Kasumi. A small explosion sounded from the beach in front of them as<br/>the ball hit the ground again.<p>"Oh my, I hope father doesn't wear himself out too much. It's been<br/>so long since they played together," commented Kasumi.<p>"Yes I know, I told them they weren't allowed to play at my house<br/>any longer after they blew up my garden," said Nodoka with a sigh.<p>"Father doesn't like to play at home, because we have to patch the<br/>holes in the dojo," pointed out Kasumi.<p>"Or the house," agreed Nodoka. "I suppose there's no harm in doing<br/>it here. This stupid competitive drive of my husbands is going to get<br/>us all killed one day."<p>"I don't think they'll go that far," said Kasumi sweetly.<p>Another explosion sounded as the ball hit the ground again. A<br/>feminine cry of 'Yatta!' floated over to the two women.<p>"Oh! It seems Akane is enjoying herself," said Kasumi cheerfully.<p>"So it seems," muttered Nodoka as she pursed her lips. Two more<br/>additions to the volleyball madness, was not something she looked<br/>forward too, but the damage had already been done.<p>++++++++++++<p>About an hour later, the beach in front of the Tendo encampment<br/>was nothing more than a patch of smoking craters. Akane was beaming<br/>proudly beside Goku, who had the ball tucked under his arm with the<br/>net.<p>"Had enough?" said Nodoka cheerfully.<p>"Yup, we won!" said Goku happily.<p>"That's three in a row for you Saotome. Perhaps I'm getting too<br/>old for this sort of thing," said Soun as he walked up beside the man<br/>with Ranma at his side.<p>"Well, Akane was a good partner, once we got started," said Goku<br/>as he rubbed at the girl's head for a moment.<p>"Yup, Akane did real good!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Even though you did get more points than she did," said Soun.<p>"Huh? I did?" muttered the redhead obliviously. "I guess I did!"<br/>she said with a proud grin of her own after counting them out in her<br/>mind.<p>"Well, we won. That's what matters," said Akane with a slight<br/>frown.<p>"I guess," replied the pigtailed girl with a shrug. "I'm hungry."<br/>She looked towards her mother and Kasumi, who were already breaking<br/>out the baskets of food, all six of them.<p>Ranma was biting into a watermelon slice within seconds, with<br/>Akane sitting beside her. The redhead suddenly went rigid as something<br/>poked at her back, she turned to see Cologne smiling at her with her<br/>staff poked out. The pigtailed girl immediately began choking on a<br/>half-chewed piece of the melon. Akane slapped her on the back and she<br/>coughed it up and gasped for breath.<p>"Why daughter in law, imagine finding you here? Did you come to<br/>visit Shampoo? I know you've missed her since we relocated for the<br/>summer."<p>Ranma blinked and looked at her. She turned towards Akane.<br/>"Shampoo's been gone?"<p>"For about two weeks," said the girl as she looked back at the old<br/>woman emotionlessly.<p>"Oh, I thought it had been quiet."<p>Cologne almost fell on her face. She had sought to lure them out<br/>here with the Phoenix Pill. "Surely you don't think you're cured of<br/>that shiatsu?" She looked directly at Akane.<p>"Um yeah, why?" replied the girl dumbly.<p>"Heh, foolish girl. You'll have to take a hot bath every day for<br/>the rest of your life, in order to keep up the immunity you've gained<br/>through your training."<p>"Akane takes a bath every night," commented Ranma with a shrug.<p>Cologne frowned; she wasn't used to having hot water so easily<br/>available as it was in Japan. The village didn't exactly have running<br/>water, and she had failed to include that in her plans. After a while,<br/>the girl's immunity would grow enough that it would be almost<br/>permanent. Apparently, these children were aware of that. "Well, the<br/>Cat's Tongue's effects grow with time. Soon, even going outside on a<br/>warm day will be enough. To say nothing of the summer heat, like<br/>say... a day like today?" It was a small lie, but enough.<p>Both teens looked at her in shock.<p>"Gotcha!" thought the hag as she eyed the reaction cheerfully.<p>"What?" stammered Akane in shock.<p>"I hadn't really intended for this to go quite that far. I'll<br/>admit I was planing on curing her after the young Daughter in law<br/>returned with us. I am not a cruel person. However, there is only one<br/>pill, and I cannot give it up without some sort of compensation."<br/>Cologne smirked as the reactions were exactly as expected.<p>Ranma jumped up and grabbed for her, Cologne jumped back merrily<br/>and waved her finger at the girl. "Now child, I don't have the pill<br/>at the moment. My young Shampoo does."<p>"And where might she be?" said a new voice from behind them.<p>Everyone turned to see Ryoga standing there, cracking his knuckles<br/>absently. He was dressed in his traveling clothes, and had his<br/>backpack slung across his shoulders.<p>"How long have you been there?" snapped Cologne.<p>"Long enough," said Ryoga with a small shrug as he frowned at her.<p>"You!" snarled Akane angrily as she began to power up.<p>"Akane! Calm down!" snapped Ranma as she stood between the pair<br/>for a moment. "He's on our side now!"<p>"For the moment," agreed Ryoga quietly. "As I said, even bringing<br/>that girl back to life won't make up for what I did. Maybe I can start<br/>making up for it now. Tell me old woman, where is this 'Pill'?"<p>Cologne glared at the boy. She recognized him after a moment of<br/>study. His hair was different now, standing upright, where it had been<br/>hanging around his face before. "You are the one who attacked my<br/>village."<p>"I attacked Ranma. He was in your village at the time. No one was<br/>hurt, so quit complaining and cough up that pill, or I might decide I<br/>don't like you," replied the boy angrily as he glared at her.<p>Akane growled at him and stepped back, allowing her aura to die<br/>down a bit. "We don't need your help."<p>Ryoga looked at her for a moment with an expression that she<br/>couldn't read. "I owe you, and your family, a debt. I intend to pay<br/>it."<p>"Akane, let it go. He's sorry he did it. We're going to fix it,"<br/>pleaded Ranma.<p>"That doesn't do me any good now," snapped the girl as she glared<br/>at the redhead for a moment. She didn't move to attack again though.<p>Cologne was standing in the middle of the scene, listening<br/>carefully. "Bring back the dead? Who is this boy?" she muttered<br/>quietly as she watched Ryoga cautiously. The situation was not getting<br/>any better, she had no doubts that she could beat the trio if<br/>necessary, but it would not be an easy task. Especially with their<br/>parents standing nearby.<p>"Now children. Let's be polite about this. Why don't we all go<br/>over there and play a little game?" The old woman pointed over to a<br/>strange looking race. An announcer was standing on a podium with a<br/>microphone, calling out loudly to the crowd in an attempt to get them<br/>to join in.<p>"Martial arts melon splitting! The rules are simple! Simply make<br/>it to the finish line with your melon intact! The other racers will<br/>attempt to split yours during the course of the race!" said the man<br/>cheerily.<p>Most of the beach goers were largely uninterested. Until...<p>"And the prize of this race is... Miss Shampoo!"<p>The amazon appeared on the podium with a familiar object in her<br/>hand.<p>"That's it," commented Ranma as she nodded towards the girl.<p>"Seems easy enough," replied Ryoga casually.<p>"Let's not over do it, there will be normal people in that race,"<br/>commented Ranma as he glanced over at both Ryoga and Akane.<p>"That's not a mistake I intend to make twice," said Ryoga darkly<br/>as he started walking forward, away from the race.<p>"This way," said Ranma with a sigh as she pulled on his arm.<p>Akane growled under her breath and followed behind the pair,<br/>clenching her fists.<p>++++++++++<p>"You fight for me, yes, Ranma?" said Shampoo as she grabbed<br/>Ranma's neck at the starting line.<p>"No, no, no!" cried Ranma as she attempted to dislodge the girls<br/>grip from her.<p>"Quit flirting Saotome. We've got a job to do," commented Ryoga<br/>with a small frown.<p>A few seconds later, she was released as Shampoo wandered over to<br/>the winner's circle. Akane glared at her fiancee for a moment and<br/>Ranma shrugged at her before taking her place at the starting line.<br/>Everyone in the race was holding a melon, and a bokuten.<p>"On your marks, get set, go!" cried the announcer. The three<br/>martial artists were gone at the same instant as the starting gun went<br/>off.<p>All the other contestant's watermelons shattered before they took<br/>their first step and they looked down dumbly. "Hey! No fair!"<p>Ryoga smirked and rushed forward, or so he thought. He was running<br/>away from the battle. His smile fell though, when Akane appeared in<br/>front of him with her melon held under her arm, and her bokuten in her<br/>grip. "We don't need your help."<p>"Like I said lady. I don't care," the lost boy rushed forward and<br/>barely missed getting his melon split by Akane. He rolled away and<br/>frowned as she spun to face him again after he had passed. Her own<br/>melon was still intact. "Damn, she's not bad, and I promised I'd take<br/>it easy... so no powering up."<p>Akane didn't seem to have that problem as her aura flared to life<br/>around her.<p>++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, Ranma rushed forward towards the finish line alone with<br/>a smirk on her face. "Heh, almost there."<p>A shadow formed over her head and she looked up to see Cologne<br/>plummeting out of the sky towards her. The old woman slashed at the<br/>ground with her staff and forced Ranma to jump back. She was surprised<br/>to find the young girl smiling at her when she turned to face her.<p>"So, you're playing too? I'm glad, I didn't want this to be too<br/>easy."<p>"Well, I just got to thinking about the days when I was a girl<br/>playing on the beach," said Cologne cheerfully.<p>Soun landed just behind her and slashed down with a bokuten of his<br/>own. Ranma jumped back once again. "Ranma! How could you? You're<br/>engaged to Akane! How could you be trying to win Shampoo?"<p>"Huh?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>Goku appeared just beside the man and put his fist through his<br/>melon. It shattered on the ground and Soun looked up at him. "Saotome?<br/>How could you?"<p>"The pill Tendo, he's trying to win the pill," said Goku as he<br/>pulled the man off the field forcibly.<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at this scene and turned back towards<br/>Ranma again.<p>"Forget about them, let's get started," said the redhead with a<br/>smirk on her face.<p>"Very well," commented Cologne as she jumped after the girl.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryoga was at a stalemate with Akane. He could overpower her easily<br/>and be done with it, but he didn't really want to hurt her. That<br/>coupled with the fact that she was even better than she was the last<br/>time they had met, made his problem more difficult that it seemed.<br/>"Cut it out will you? We're missing the battle!"<p>"I won't let you!" snarled Akane bitterly as she jumped forward.<p>A red blur passed over them and both their melons shattered in an<br/>instant. Both looked up to see Ranma glancing back at them as she<br/>rushed away. "Quit goofing off and find the stupid pill!"<p>"Uh, right," muttered Akane as she looked at the juice that now<br/>covered her hand for a moment.<p>The redhead appeared in front of the finish line and paused as<br/>Cologne stopped her cold directly in front of her.<p>"Hey, you're faster than you look," commented Ranma coolly.<p>"Yes, you're a hundred years too slow to beat me," said the old<br/>woman cheerfully.<p>"Heh, somehow, I doubt that," replied the girl with a smirk.<p>"At any rate, I won't let you pass, until you choose Shampoo,"<br/>said the old woman.<p>The bokuten and the staff blurred in the air as the two combatants<br/>struck at one another. Finally, Ranma managed to get a blow in, as<br/>Cologne jumped up and slashed at Ranma's melon, and missed.<p>"What? How?" snapped the hag as she glared at the girl for a<br/>moment. Ranma hacked at her staff and smirked. "Since when are you<br/>good enough to split my melon?"<p>"Heh, old lady, I'm still holding back, and so are you," replied<br/>the redhead with a smirk. She slashed and forced the staff from<br/>Cologne's grip, catching it with her foot. "Come on, let's see what<br/>you've really got." She flipped her foot out slightly and tossed the<br/>staff back.<p>"It seems I've underestimated you," commented Cologne dryly. "We<br/>must have him!" she thought to herself as she picked up the staff.<br/>"How about a little deal? If you win, I'll give you the real Phoenix<br/>Pill. If I win, you return to China with me and Shampoo, and become<br/>her bride."<p>"Sure thing old woman, if you can beat me that is," said the girl<br/>with a smirk on her face.<p>"Aiyah! Shampoo so happy!" exclaimed the Amazon from the<br/>sidelines.<p>"Heh, I'm not worried," commented Akane lazily from beside her.<br/>Her face fell a moment later as Cologne seemed to blur around Ranma<br/>giving the impression of many images of her at once. She pushed the<br/>sand up into the redhead's face and cackled merrily. Ranma merely<br/>stood there, as the sand seemed to pass right through her.<p>"Well little girl, you'll be good enough to beat me, in about a<br/>hundred years!" snapped the old woman as she moved. He stopped<br/>laughing when Ranma seemed to appear in front of her face. "What?"<br/>They jumped away from each other and Cologne frowned. "She's more<br/>skilled than I had thought possible! Still, no match for me though."<p>The hag charged forward faster than Ranma had ever seen her move<br/>before. The pair vanished for a moment and reappeared just over the<br/>water. Ranma had a serious look on her face, and Cologne mirrored that<br/>look almost exactly.<p>"Well, since we're in the ocean, let me show you a fun water<br/>trick!" said Cologne. Both went under and the old woman spun her staff<br/>in a tight circle, pointing it directly at Ranma.<p>A huge waterspout blasted up from the surface.<p>"Look a waterspout!" cried one of the spectators.<p>"Inside it!" agreed one of the others.<p>Cologne could be seen inside the waterspout, with Ranma in a<br/>headlock.<p>"Grrvvlllurrrppp?" asked Cologne.<p>Ranma, just smiled.<p>"A headlock," commented Soun lazily.<p>"Ranma give up now!" called Shampoo happily.<p>"You don't think that's enough to beat her do you?" said Akane<br/>with a smirk on her face.<p>"Huh? What you talking?" said Shampoo obliviously. Surely her<br/>great grandmother knew what she was doing?<p>A light formed inside the waterspout for a moment, just before it<br/>exploded, sending a shower of water all over the beach. Cologne landed<br/>nearby on the surface of the water and stood there. Turning to face<br/>her opponent in shock.<p>Ranma was floating in the air, just inside a sphere of blue<br/>energy. It died down and she floated down next to Cologne, appearing<br/>to stand on the water as well.<p>"That's a neat trick," commented the old woman. Her mind was<br/>laughing out loud though. Surely she would have used all her energy up<br/>with a blast like that.<p>The old woman's foothold was revealed, as a twenty-foot shark<br/>jumped suddenly with her standing on top of it.<p>The crowd on the beach stood in silence for a moment, just<br/>watching the scene. After a moment, Akane spoke up. "It's a shark."<p>"It is, isn't it?" agreed Soun.<p>"Hey, she's not bad," commented Goku cheerfully.<p>"Great Grandmother is greatest!" snapped Shampoo at him angrily.<p>Out over the ocean, Cologne struck the water with her fists, and<br/>it slammed into Ranma's chest in the shape of a shark. "Semeken!"<p>Ranma was thrown into the air by the force of the unexpected blow<br/>and sank into the water again.<p>The shark dove in after her and Ranma was just starting to recover<br/>as it passed by beside her. She trust her hands forward once again,<br/>and tossed the pigtailed girl out of the water and into the air.<p>Akane gasped in shock as the girl fell limply back into the waves.<br/>"No! He'll drown!" she cried as she rushed forward. "Ranma! I'm<br/>coming!" she thought as she dove into the water. "Now what was that<br/>again? Oh yeah! Breathe deeply, and fly underwater." She then took a<br/>deep breath, after breaking the surface of the water. About a half<br/>second later, she flailed her arms around and sank like a rock.<p>Ranma, who was floating nearby, turned her head and stared in<br/>shock as her fiancee passed by, on her way down. She spun around<br/>underwater and dove after her, pulling her up to the surface.<p>"Akane... what are you doing out here?" she said as they broke the<br/>surface.<p>"b-but you... hack, hack, hack, hack," replied Akane as she<br/>coughed up the water she had swallowed.<p>Cologne appeared just behind them on top of the shark. The animal<br/>was bearing down on them and breached the water with its mouth open.<br/>"Oh, some poor girl has fallen into the water. I'll just have to get<br/>rid of her," commented the old woman merrily.<p>Ranma's face became serious suddenly, and she raised her palm out<br/>of the water, pointing it at the creature.<p>Cologne's eyes went wide as a blast of light struck her, throwing<br/>her into the air, and onto the beach. She landed roughly and lay still<br/>in the sand for a moment.<p>"Aiya! Great Grandmother!" exclaimed Shampoo as she fell to her<br/>knees beside the old woman.<p>"Impossible!" muttered Cologne as she tried to force herself up<br/>with her arms.<p>"Well, well," said Ryoga as he took something from the helpless<br/>old woman's pocket. "What have we here?" Ranma and Akane landed next<br/>to them softly, and he tossed the Phoenix Pill to Akane casually and<br/>smirked at her for a moment.<p>"Yeah, thanks," grumbled the girl irritably as she opened the<br/>container and swallowed the pill. "Just don't think you're off the<br/>hook for this yet."<p>"It's a start," replied the boy as he floated into the air and<br/>flew off. He stopped and looked back at the ground for a moment. "I<br/>wonder why Ranma held back so much? Oh well." He simply flew away,<br/>going back on his way.<p>"You! Don't ever threaten Akane like that again!" snapped Ranma as<br/>he glared at the old woman for a moment. "This was between us!"<p>"I wasn't going to really hurt her," muttered Cologne as she<br/>glared up at him. "I can see that I shouldn't have held back anything<br/>against you. That was foolish."<p>"Old woman, you haven't even seen half of my true power," snapped<br/>Ranma in retort.<p>Cologne waved that off easily. She had to be bragging about that;<br/>there was no way anyone could be as strong as that at her age. "Well,<br/>it was fun. It brings back memories of better times." Cologne sat up<br/>and pat her back for a moment before standing. "We'll withdraw for<br/>today, consider the Phoenix Pill a gift, for a fighting spirit. Come<br/>Shampoo, we're leaving." The two amazons started walking away. "See<br/>you around... Son in law."<p>Akane turned towards her fiancee with a worried look on her face.<p>"Hey, old lady," said Ranma with a smirk.<p>"Yes?" said Cologne.<p>Ranma merely pointed at the finish line to the race behind her,<br/>and lifted her foot up. Sitting there on top of it, was a slightly<br/>cooked, but still intact, watermelon. "I win."<p>Cologne felt something inside her snap. She simply stood there,<br/>with her mouth hanging open and gawked at the girl. After a moment,<br/>she closed her mouth and nodded. "So it seems. Come Shampoo." The pair<br/>walked away, leaving the two families to their day at the beach.<p>+++++++++++++<p>That night, Ranma flew just behind the two families holding the<br/>sleeping form of Akane Tendo in his arms. He hung back a bit,<br/>partially because of his double load due to the girl sleeping in his<br/>arms, and partially because he wanted to take his time, and enjoy the<br/>evening.<p>Akane muttered in her sleep and pushed her head against his neck.<br/>Ranma smiled at this and looked down at her for a moment. Akane<br/>responded to him moving his head and wrapped her arms around his neck.<br/>"Ranma."<p>"Huh?" said the boy, just before she kissed him full on the lips.<p>He froze in mid flight, and simply hung there, with the girl in<br/>his arms. Her eyes fluttered open for a moment and she looked at him.<p>"What the heck do you think you're doing?" she snapped as she<br/>slapped him across his face.<p>"Huh? What?" stammered the boy in shock.<p>"You were sleeping!" he cried defensively.<p>"So you thought it was okay to kiss me?" she retorted angrily.<p>"Hey! You kissed me! I wasn't doin nuthin!" he snapped at her with<br/>confusion and frustration clear on his face.<p>"I... what?" said Akane as she looked at him dumbly.<p>"I was just carrying you. You said my name and kissed me in your<br/>sleep," said the boy as he seemed to relax a bit more.<p>Akane just hung there, looking at him in shock with tears in her<br/>eyes. "R-Ranma? I..."<p>"Look, I'm sorry," said the boy in an attempt to pacify her.<p>She looked at him with a sudden dread in her eyes and backed away.<br/>"No! I don't want to be in love with you!" After that, she blasted<br/>across the sky at full speed.<p>"Akane!" cried Ranma as he followed after her, not managing to<br/>catch up because of his load. "Wait..." he muttered as he slowed<br/>suddenly and watched her vanish into the horizon. "Great. Now what did<br/>I do?" he asked himself angrily.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"You're home," said Akane quietly as she stepped out onto the<br/>roof. Ranma was sitting there, staring at the stars.<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, are you still mad at me?" said the boy as he sat<br/>up and looked at her for a moment with worry in his eyes.<p>"Stop that," she whispered.<p>"Huh?" he managed.<p>"Don't apologize..." she said as she sat down a comfortable<br/>distance away from him. "Look, it was my fault. I'm sorry. I'm just<br/>confused right now."<p>"Oh," said Ranma as he lay back down and looked up at the stars<br/>again.<p>"Ranma?"<p>"Yeah?"<p>"I'm sorry, for everything," said the girl as she moved a little<br/>closer to him.<p>"Huh? Why?"<p>"I've treated you terribly. I mean, since you came here. I'm<br/>really sorry," said the girl with tears forming in her eyes.<p>"What? You've been a great friend!" cried Ranma defensively. Akane<br/>reached out and put her hand over his mouth.<p>"No I haven't, you have. You're always telling me how great I am.<br/>I'm really not. I even told you I hated you, when all you wanted was<br/>to be my friend."<p>"That was a long time ago! I almost forgot it happened," said<br/>Ranma honestly.<p>"No, there were other times, that was just the worst. I've never<br/>really been all that nice to you."<p>Ranma frowned at her, it was clear he had no idea what she was<br/>talking about. He managed to keep quiet though and simply nodded.<p>Akane gave a small gentle laugh. "Jerk, you don't have to lie. I<br/>can tell you have no idea what I mean."<p>"Oh? Okay," said the boy with a small shrug.<p>"Ranma, I really mean it. I'm sorry," she said as she looked at<br/>him again. "For tonight especially. I never should have said that."<p>Ranma was speechless; he had no idea what to do. He simply<br/>fidgeted for a moment and looked away from her. "It's okay, really<br/>Akane. I ain't mad or nothin," he finally managed.<p>"I know," she said and kissed him gently on the lips.<p>Ranma sat there in shock, waiting for the retribution that usually<br/>followed a moment like this between them. Nothing happened, Akane<br/>simply kissed him for a moment, stood up, and walked away. Going back<br/>down into the yard, and then into the home.<p>He sat there, looking out across the city for a long time.<br/>Finally, he scratched his head. "Huh?"<p>++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The Sacred Waters of Jusenkyo!<p>BTW: Cologne referring to Ranma as 'Son in law' wasn't a typo.<br/>You'll notice everyone else talking about him as a boy. She just<br/>figured it out.<p>
