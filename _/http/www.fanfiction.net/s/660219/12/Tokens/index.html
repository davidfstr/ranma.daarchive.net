</div><p>Tarou hung about the gates of Dara,  waiting for his group of soldiers to ride in with the prisoners, Queen Nodoka and her daughters.</p><p>Another  contingent of his father's troops had joined him, and they lounged about the  gates now, talking to the gate guards. One gate-guard desultorily questioned  those seeking entrance into the city.<p>The prince watched as travelers, families, merchants and caravans were allowed  through the gates. One such fat, little merchant had gained entrance and was  waiting near the gates, chatting with one of his own men, watching as his  camels filed through. The caravan guards rode up and down the line, making sure  it all went smoothly.<p>One caravan guard made Tarou pause. Something about  him seemed familiar. The guard was riding up the line, gaining speed as he  rode, drawing closer to the Arun prince. The guard's  head cloth fell away and with complete surprise, Tarou  recognized the furious face.<p>"Die, Tarou!" Ukyou screamed, her spatula whirling as her horse thundered toward  him.<p>By God, she's magnificent, Tarou  had a moment to think before he truly realized his danger. He dropped and  rolled across the ground, the flat blade of the spatula missing him by mere  inches.<p>"Ukyou!" Another of the guards left the caravan and galloped towards them,  followed by a third guard. By this time, Tarou's  guards had reacted to the threat and were attacking Ukyou  with their sabres.<p>"Don't kill her! I want her alive! All of them alive!" The prince shouted. He could guess who her helpers were.<p>Akane felt panic bloom in her chest as her horse reached Ukyou's  side. The guards outnumbered their trio by five to one, by her count. They  couldn't hope to defeat all these soldiers, and Akane had never tried combat on  horseback.<p>"Ukyou! We can't fight all these men¦.We  have to run!" She hissed, parrying a guard's sabre with her long dagger. She couldn't brace herself  properly in the saddle and the clash of steel against steel rang through her  arm.<p>The Cantonian princess had a wild look in her eye.  Her face was flushed with rage and determination, her lip was bleeding, and she  swung her spatula like berserkers must have in the tales Akane had heard as a  young child. She was trying to fight her way through to the prince who stood dusting  himself off a short distance away.<p>"Akane! What's going on here? Why did that dumb fool think she could take on Tarou AND his guards?" Ranma had joined  them and  he, too, was doing his best to keep the guards at bay.<p>"I think she went berserk," Akane panted, struggling to  juggle the reins and the dagger and feeling very sorry for her horse. It didn't  understand the signals she was sending it and was fighting the bit in its  mouth.<p>"There's no way she can reach him. We're completely outnumbered," her fiance said,  his cold  eyes fixed on the next attacker. Akane couldn't argue. He was merely echoing her own thoughts. Damn!<p>"Behind you. Reinforcements." Akane went cold on hearing that and she turned in her saddle.</p><p>Ranma  scowled. "We have to get out of here. Come on. He wheeled  his horse  and somehow forced his way to Ukyou' s side. She uttered a squeak as he scooped her off her  horse, surprising her as well as the guards. He slashed at the guards ferociously  and then slipped past them before they had realized it.<p>"Come on, Akane!" He obviously had a tight hold on Ukyou, who was squirming in his grip. He urged his horse  away from the approaching guards and made it leap a cart in his path. Akane had  no choice but to follow and hope her horse could jump as well. She closed her  eyes and uttered a breathless prayer as the horse gathered itself and leapt.  They landed with bone-jarring suddenness and Akane did her best to guide the  horse after Ranma's mount, which was fast  disappearing down the street.<p>She could hear pursuit behind them, and she pressed close to the horse's hot  neck and urged it on, thankful that her short locks didn't whip about wildly  from the wind. The streets here were quite wide and not very busy, and they  followed twisting, turning streets into the heart of the city. Eventually, they  had to slow down. The crowds and stalls were growing thicker and the horses had  to make their way through them carefully. She risked a glance behind and saw the  guards grimly following.<p>She had caught up with Ranma and Ukyou, the latter  sulking. Ranma threw the pony-tailed princess a disgusted look.<p>"I wish I had time to thrash you, but I don't," he said. "We'll have to  leave the horses. The crowds are getting too heavy."<p>They looked behind and saw that the guards were dismounting as well.<p>"Hurry!" Ranma yelled, and practically tossed Ukyou  off his  horse. He jumped down to join her and Akane dismounted, too. "We'll have to ditch  the horses. Let's go!"<p>The trio made their way through the crowds, weaving through dirty street  children, women, vendors and stalls. The guards were gaining. The crowds were  getting heavier and heavier.<p>A knot of women moved out the way and suddenly the trio was confronted by a  group of guards, their blades out and gleaming silver.<p>"Damn it!" Ranma swore, as he and Akane pulled out their blades and  began to defend themselves. Ukyou  stood still.<p>Then she whipped out her spatula.<p>"Ranma! Akane! Run!" she cried. "Go! I'll take care of this  scum."<p>"We're not leaving you, Ukyou!" Akane yelled, wishing her blade was longer as the dagger clanged against  a sword, then slid down the blade until it locked with the hilt.<p>"I'll be fine! You two need to do what you came here for!" Ukyou swung her spatula in a massive  arc, sending soldiers sprawling.<p>"Shut the hell up, Ukyou!" Ranma couldn't believe the stupid girl. No way was he going to leave her  in the hands of these men. After all, he told himself, he could still use her.<p>"Tarou wants me alive, you idiot!" Ukyou cried. "And that's  exactly where I want to be, too! Now, go!" With those words,  she flung herself into the group of guards, who, caught by surprise, tried to  avoid stabbing her.<p>"More guards!" Akane pointed. Up the street, even more  guards were approaching them. It was a classic two-pronged approach. Ranma  cursed out loud in frustration. Ukyou was being held  fast now, and she was too far to reach before the group of soldiers approaching  from up the street got to them.<p>"In here!" Ranma grabbed Akane and pulled her into a dark, grimy alley.  They began to run, jumping over trash bins and broken wagon wheels.<p>Out of the gloom, a tall peeling wooden fence suddenly loomed in front of them.  It was thick and a good ten feet high.<p>"Jump!" Ranma cried. Weaving his  fingers in a cradle, he mimed a throwing action. Akane understood. She placed her foot  into his cupped hands and his strong arms heaved her over the fence.<p>Suddenly she heard the clash of steel on Ranma's side  of the fence.<p>"Oh, no!" Akane dragged a large wooden  box upto the fence. Climbing it, she peered over the  top to see Ranma fighting three guards. A fourth was closing in from behind.<p>"No you don't!" she yelled, and flung her dagger like  a throwing  knife at him. It pierced his shoulder and he went down with a scream. Ranma  gave the third guard a last kick, grabbed Akane's  dagger and pulled it out, and leapt over the fence.<p>"Are you all right?" Akane asked, her anxious gaze checking  him for wounds. Ranma flashed her a quick, cynical  smile.<p>"Thanks to you. I hope you don't regret it later,  Akane," he said, a glint in his clear grey eyes.<p>There was shouting behind them. After exchanging a look, the pair took off  again down the alley. It intersected another alley and they followed it up,  until it finally ended at a very high stone wall. The two of them stared at it.<p>"I can't jump that," Akane panted. "All this sheer black marble makes it impossible."<p>Before she knew it, Ranma had scooped her up in his arms. She felt him tense  and then he sprang up, up, onto the wall, balancing there lightly, and then  sprang down into the interior. They glanced around cautiously.<p>A bouquet of scents assaulted their noses. Akane recognized the perfume of  flowers and oranges. They stood in a large, perfumed garden of intoxicating  beauty. Orange trees stood in tidy rows, and thousands of flowers bloomed in  flowerbeds, on bushes and spilled riotously from baskets and low circular stone  fences that encircled a large gushing fountain with statues in the middle.  Birdsong filled the air, and they caught flashes of color at the edges of their  vision.<p>However, this was not the most remarkable thing. What made the duo stare was  the almost-naked girl.<p>She stood a few feet away from them. Her hair flowed in long inky curls past  her hips, and her large, kohled eyes surveyed them  with some degree of astonishment. Fat gold bracelets encircled her wrists and  gold jeweled armbands encircled her upper arms. Jeweled anklets closed around  her ankles.<p>She wore only a dark purple bodice, so tiny that her generous bosom all but  spilled out, and transparent harem pants that revealed every delicious inch and  curve of her limbs in loving detail.<p>Akane could feel the heat of Ranma's blush. She  herself could feel her eyes bulging.<p>"Aiyah! Shampoo have visitors!" The girl exclaimed. "Is death  to be seen in garden of king's courtesans. You such brave  men!</p><p>Ranma groaned. "The king's courtesans? How in the entire  world did we end up here?"It was tradition that a king kept courtesans. It was  fact that any male who was not a eunuch or the king and was caught in the  company of a courtesan was instantly executed.<p>Akane suddenly realized she was still in Ranma's  arms. She tapped his chest and he let her down to stand on her own feet.<p>Shampoo had been walking toward them, though Akane privately decided the  courtesan wiggled way too much. Her hips swung with every step, creating a  pleasing sway to her walk. She sauntered over to Ranma and slid a perfectly  manicured, pampered finger down the line of his chest.<p>"You come to see Shampoo?" she asked coyly,  flirtatiously peeking up at him through her long, thick lashes.<p>Someone could trip over those, Akane thought uncharitably.<p>Shampoo placed her hand high on Ranma's arm and  squeezed lightly. Ranma watched as her eyes widened in appreciation. She tugged  at him lightly.<p>"We go in, I serve you delicacies…whatever you want." Her admiring gaze left no doubt on the nature of the 'delicacies'.<p>"Um, Lady Shampoo..." Ranma began, and then paused as they  all heard the sound of booted feet running toward them.<p>"Quickly, you must hide!" Shampoo ushered them both in through the wide  windows into the black-marbled mansion behind her. They followed Shampoo as she  led them through richly carpeted and furnished rooms to a sitting area. Bright  cushions the color of jewels spilled in abundance on the marble floor. What  really drew their attention was a marble bath, the size of a large pond, set in  the middle of the room. Silver and gold taps gleamed, and steam rose from the  water.<p>Women in various stages of undress lounged around on the cushions, on divans  and even in the pool. Akane wanted to cover Ranma's  eyes. The women tittered and began to question Shampoo.<p>"More visitors, Shampoo?"<p>"Who are they?"<p>"Have they come to steal a glimpse of us?"<p>"Shampoo no have time for silly questions, sisters!" The purple- haired courtesan glared at the women. "Guards coming  to look for these men. Must hide them."<p>The women looked delighted.<p>*************************************************<p>Ukyou clenched her teeth. Seated in front of a guard  on his trotting horse, she slowed her breathing to reduce her panic. She flexed  her bound wrists and hoped she wouldn't fall off the horse. The gait jarred her  and made her seat precarious, not that the guard or any of his fellow guards  would care.<p>Remember, this is what you wanted, she told herself. Soon, you'll be face to  face with that barbarian again, and that's what you came to Dara  for.<p>She hadn't thought she'd be facing him bound, though. Not again. Memories of  her wedding night crashed through her. Long, knowing fingers clamped over her  breast, hands with bracered wrists holding her down,  and in her mind's eye, Ukyou saw mocking green eyes  and a sardonic smile. She shivered. It didn't matter. She'd come a long way  since that night. She was no longer a helpless maiden. Somehow, she was going  to find a way to thank Tarou for that.<p>*********************************************<p>Ranma and Akane considered each other. Ranma, now in girl form, wore a red  bustier set with tiny red zircons, and filmy red harem pants. Her feet had been  inserted into golden shoes with the toes upturned. Akane wore similar outfits.  Ranma couldn't help giving Akane's outfit occasional  glances. She had never imagined the short-haired girl could look so sultry.<p>Akane was blushing furiously. Her legs were completely exposed. The transparent  cloth revealed a lot more than it hid.<p>A tall, black-skinned man in silk pants and a vest strode into the hall. He  stood eyeing the bevy of beauteous women who regarded him through limpid eyes,  their faces modestly covered by veils. It was Aziz, the man in charge of the  harem.<p>"Ladies," he said, "the king's guards believe there are intruders  within these walls." He held up a large hand at the  cries of outrage that emitted from the women. "I have informed the guards that  I shall check for them myself. No men are allowed here."<p>He paused. "Now, each of you will come up to me, and I will check to see if you  are indeed a woman." He was well acquainted with the practice  of dressing up men in women's clothes. Sometimes, men even shaved, and unless  he checked properly, it would be hard to tell who was truly a woman. He had  already sent attendants to the women's rooms to check for intruders.<p>Slowly, the women formed a line. As each stopped before him, Aziz reached out  and softly squeezed the breasts of each woman with his hands. Satisfied with  the result, he would wave her on, and the next would stand before him.<p>"I don't know if I can stand some guy pawing at me," Ranma whispered.<p>"Is okay. You have magic that make you women, yes?" Shampoo  whispered. Finding out that Ranma could 'fake' being a woman had surprised her.  "Aziz is eunuch. He no can do anything to you, even if he want."<p>"Oh." Ranma frowned. Hm. That made sense, she supposed. Imagine it's a girl,  she told herself. Before she knew it, she was standing in front of Aziz, who  apparently had no problem with the women leaving their veils on even as he was  touching them intimately. She clenched her teeth. Aziz's  hands were harmless. She remembered to breathe when he released her. She moved  on to join Shampoo. Akane, next in line, stiffened, but was quickly waved on.<p>Aziz, satisfied with the women, left to tell the guards they had been mistaken.<p>Shampoo quickly grabbed the opportunity.<p>"Now you all turn men again, and we   you," she said to the trio.<p>"I'm not a boy!" Akane felt her face turning red.  Shampoo  looked surprised. "Really? But you have very short  hair. And so manly. Shampoo thought you was boy for sure!"<p></p><p>Ranma  grabbed Akane's rising fist.<p>"Lady Shampoo." His expression was polite. "You have  our thanks  for hiding us, but we really have urgent business in Dara."<p>"That's right." Akane wanted to get out of the filmy  harem  clothes as soon as possible.<p>Shampoo crossed her arms. "What so urgent you no have time to spend with  beautiful women?"<p>"We have to see the king," Ranma said rather shortly.  Now that they  were actually in the city, she suddenly wanted to confront the king as soon as  possible. She felt a moment's regret. They had left Cologne behind in their haste, without any  chance to say farewell. She could only hope that the old woman would find her  grand-daughter.<p>"King Kunou?" Shampoo's eyes  lit up. "Why, he is coming here tonight! To his harem."<p>Ranma and Akane stared at her speechlessly.<p>************************************************************************<p>Notes: Wow, I can see the end approaching. A couple or three more chapters, and I'm done!<p>NEXT time: Will Tarou have his wicked way with Ukyou yet again? Is Ranma REALLY impervious to Shampoo?  Where is Nodoka? And everybody else, come to think of  it? Click the button and please review! :)</p>
