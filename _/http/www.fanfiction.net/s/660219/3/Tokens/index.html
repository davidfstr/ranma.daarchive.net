</div><p>Disclaimer: Ranma &amp; Co.  belong to Rumiko Takahashi.</p><p>Excerpt:- Akane sat  up in her bath. Ranma? Had she heard something? She  sat quietly for a moment, water dripping from her sleek body, her head tilted  to catch any sound. But there was only the sound of drops plopping back into  the water.<p>****************************************************************************<p><b>Nine Years Later</b></p><p>Splash!<p>Ranma balanced easily on the slim bamboo stick and watched his foster father  fall into one of the pools dotting the ground below them.<p>He stared in amazement as a huge panda came hurtling out of the pool and, in  his surprise, he could not avoid being knocked off the perch. He fell into  water.<p>Did I see a…?<p>He kicked and surfaced, water streaming through his hair and blurring his  vision. He looked down and seeing that he had suddenly gained breasts, screamed  in horror.<p>I'm a girl! Is this some nightmare? Am I dreaming?<p>The monk of the pools came running in terror, just in time to see a red haired  girl and a panda staring at each other.<p>"Oh, no! Your Majesty! Your Royal Highness! You have fallen in the pools of Drowned  Panda and Drowned Girl." The monk stopped because his knees were shaking with  terror.<p>The oasis of Jusenkyou had a reputation as a cursed place. No camel train or  merchant caravan, however thirsty their animals, would ever stop at the many  springs of water that gushed from the ground. They might stop briefly at the  monastery that guarded the springs. The monks had their own tiny spring, the  source of all their water.<p>And now King Genma, the Tyrant of Jiya, had come to train with his only son, and  they had been cursed. It was impossible for even the King to kill a monk  without repercussion, but Genma was not the Tyrant of Jiya for nothing.<p>The monk saw visions of whips and chains in his near future.<p>"Don't worry," he stammered. "Hot water will turn you back." They didn't ask,  he reasoned, about cold water. They could find out for themselves. By that  time, he and his fellow monks would have fled across the desert to Jin.<p>Ranma listened dazedly through the monk's explanations. She turned to see the  panda growling deep in its throat and turned back to the monk.<p>"Boil us some hot water."<p>She watched monk fiddle with a kettle for a moment before her tenous self-  control splintered.<p>"This is all your fault!" she screamed at the panda.  "How could you bring us to this cursed place?" The panda gave her a powerful  swat that sent her flying to the ground.<p>"Why you..!" Filled with fury, Ranma attacked Genma viciously. Cursed to be a  girl! For even these brief moments, to be a girl, for one's body to be soft and  yielding, as Ranma never would allow herself, no, HIMSELF, to be.<p>Unexpectedly, Ranma thought of Akane. He still remembered the soft touch of her  lips against his.<p>He'd thought of her when he was 10 years old and had stapled Jso's hands to the  wall with his own too-long, too-pretty daggers. Jso had coughed blood in the  end. His crushed throat had prevented him from begging for his life, but that  hadn't stopped him from trying, the prince remembered with bitter amusement.<p>At the last, Ranma had grown sick of the sight of his face and slashed his  throat. Genma had watched smirking all the while, his arms folded and his legs  apart in his stance of warrior pride. Genma had tired of his lover by then.<p>The monk fled as soon as the water began to boil. Ranma snatched up the kettle  and upended it over himself. He felt the change, felt himself growing. He was a  man again. But he still remembered Akane.<p>He tossed the empty kettle to the ground and walked off, leaving Genma in a  fury, trying to collect water for himself.<p>Stalking through the city, Ranma's thoughts returned to the war. Genma had  often led his armies in the place of his general. At such times, Ranma was  chained to the wall in his old room in the dungeons, and not released on pain  of death till Genma returned.<p>And the demon always returned.<p>"Nothing can kill that one!" swore a soldier once in Ranma's hearing.  "I saw him cleave through a warhorse once, simply to unseat his  opponent!"<p>"I heard he chained our army together in the last battle, so that the  soldiers would not be able to lose courage and run."<p>"Yes, it truly was 'kill or be killed'," noted an old spearman.  "They had no choice at all but to stand and fight or be cut down where  they stood."<p>Back in the palace, Ranma stared at himself in his full length mirror, imported  at great cost from Cantos, where such things were made.<p>"You look worried, brother," said a calm voice behind him. He turned around to  see Nabiki, his second eldest foster-sister, leaning against the doorway.<p>The two true-blood daughters of Genma had grown up into self-controlled young  women. They never gave their emotions away. Kasumi smiled through both  blessings and beatings, and she had discovered a talent for cookery at a young  age. She had enjoyed it and the assistant cook down in the kitchens had been  happy to teach her, until Genma found out. He had the assistant-cook carved up  in front of Kasumi with his own knife.<p>Kasumi had smiled through that, too, Ranma had heard.<p>Nabiki, on the other hand, always wore a stoic, sometimes calculating  expression. Genma's second daughter had somehow learned early that having  leverage over others made her stay at the palace more bearable. She spent all  her time eavesdropping and collecting information the way ants stored up food  for the winter. She had pages and some younger servants in her employ, Ranma  knew. She had blackmailed him, too, when she felt the need.<p>But he never held it against her. They all survived here as they knew best.<p>He looked back at the mirror.<p>A sixteen year old boy stared back at him. Slim and muscular, his shining black  hair tied back in a braid that bisected his shoulder blades. His glance skimmed  the cobalt blue eyes and rested on the reassuringly large fists with their  callused knuckles and fingers.<p>Yes, he was most definitely male. He had nothing to fear.<p>"It's nothing, Nabiki."<p>He turned and went to his washing basin, and splashed some cold water on his  face. He came back to the mirror and stared at himself. At the edge of his  vision, a blurred image of Nabiki's shocked white face wavered.<p>An ominous silence hung in the room, the calm before the storm.</p><p>"…..!"<p>*********************************************************<p><b>The City of Jin<p>Akane sat up  in her bath. Ranma? Had she heard something? She sat  quietly for a moment, water dripping from her sleek body, her head tilted to  catch any sound. But there was only the sound of drops plopping back into the  water.<p>She sighed and rose from the tub, wrapping a large, woven towel about herself.  What had suddenly made her start thinking about Ranma? She had only seen him  that one time, nine years ago, and she suspected she had suppressed some of  those memories.<p>Of course, there was a lot of reason to think about him now, she chided  herself.<p>In three weeks, on the day after her sixteenth birthday, she would have to  travel again to Jiya to formalize her betrothal to Ranma. Then she would stay  with him for the space of a year. To live in that awful place…<p>"Hello, Akane."<p>Akane swung around with a shriek. "Ryouga!" Her cousin  grinned unrepentantly at her, a bunch of wildflowers clutched in his large  fist.<p>"Ryouga! I'm not dressed! Why didn't you knock?"<p>"These are for you, Akane." He held out the flowers. She smiled and took them.  It was hard to be mad at Ryouga. Her cousin was so harmless. He really was a  sweet boy. She knew Soun looked to him as his successor.<p>"Thank you, Ryouga," She took the flowers and slid the stems into a glass vase  on her vanity. "Now, you must leave. I have to get dressed."<p>"Very well. I'll meet you downstairs for dinner," he  said. Akane took a second to look outside her room. Yes, her cousin's navigator  was with him. He probably would get Ryouga to dinner on time.<p>Back in her room, Akane dressed in a soft, white, cotton tunic with embroidery  on the neck and sleeves, an embroidered vest and loose pants that she tucked  into her knee high boots.<p>She continued to think about Jiya. Her sisters. Kasumi and Nabiki. When she'd last seen them, they had been  little more than shadows, hiding behind curtains and bustling servants. She  wondered what they were like, now.<p>And Ranma. She'd made a promise to save him. She  planned to fulfill it this time.<p>*******************************************************************<p>Nearly 4 Weeks Later, On the Streets of Jiya<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></b>Akane lifted the curtain of her palanquin to peek outside. The avenue they  were traveling was filled with people throwing flowers and maize at her  procession. The citizens of Jiya. She could see that  the more prosperous citizens stood at the front of the crowds, but on the  whole, these people did not seem nearly as happy or well-fed as her own. Akane  snorted and sat back. And she was going to be queen to these people?<p>At the palace steps, the Jinian procession paused, and Akane waited tensely,  though she remained serene on the outside. She dared not look through the  curtains. Everyone's eyes were no doubt on the palanquin already. She watched  as a callused hand drew the curtain back.<p>Akane and Ranma met face to face again after nine years. They stared at each  other. Everyone waited.<p>"Is her beauty so great, boy, that you are struck  dumb?" Genma strode forward and peered into the palanquin, his eyes skimming  Akane's form from head to toe.<p>"By the beard of Gulzar!" he exclaimed. "Let's see her in the daylight, boy!"  He reached to pull her out, but Ranma blocked him.<p>"I have her," he said quietly. He clasped Akane's hand and led her out to stand  on the palace steps. The crowds stared at them in awe.<p>"After all, Nodoka's mother was one of the great beauties of Jiya," a  courtier's wife whispered to another. "It's really not a surprise."<p>"I have heard she is known as the Flower of Jin."<p>"They grow them well there, don't they?"<p>Tofu heard the whispers around him, and his clasped hands tightened. She was  beautiful. And what black thing masqueraded as the heart of Genma would destroy  anything of beauty.<p>The councilor glanced at his colleagues. Kalamari, the wisest of all of them,  wore a strained look, as though he were thinking of something. His nose began  to twitch.<p>And that was how Akane came again to Jiya.</p>
