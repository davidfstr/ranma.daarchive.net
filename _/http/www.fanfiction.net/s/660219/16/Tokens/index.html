</div><p>Disclaimer: Ranma and co. aren't mine. I just act like they are! Bwahahahaha….</p><p>A/N: Wow, as a recent reviewer said, it has been 3 years since I updated this story! That was because I lost the plot thread. But now it has shimmered alive in my hands again, and I think I see the end. If anyone is still reading this, thank you! Thank you so much.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Tarou lay bared to the waist in his bed, staring up at the ceiling and breathing shallowly because the bandages around his ribs were too tight to do anything else. A whole evening had gone by after his servant had come in and, seeing his prince lying in a pool of blood, had screamed for the guards and the doctors. There had been a confusing babble of voices, and hands touching him. The pain had madehim fall unconscious, into a deep drugged sleep. Now, it was near midnight, and he'd come awake to darkness and the soft sounds of the street outside his window.</p><p>He couldn't sleep. Ukyou's words kept running through his head. Had Genma really know about his and his sister's whereabouts the night they were attacked by Ukyou's family? Of course, Genma was their enemy, and didn't owe them anything, but Kodachi had been innocent! The more Tarou thought about it, the worse his suspicions grew.</p><p>Finally, he couldn't take it any longer. He rolled out of bed with a groan at the twinge in his ribs, but the bandages were really tied too tight for the wound to bleed much. The wound…that made him think of Ukyou again, but this time, remembering her fierce face, her warrior stance, her body…how alluring she had looked in that green dress…</p><p>He shook his head to clear it. He had things to do, and needed a clear head. He was going to resolve this war, one way or the other.</p><p>A servant came in, and rushed forward, trying to push him back into the pillows. "My lord, please, you're hurt! Please lie back!"</p><p>Tarou scowled, and swiped with an arm, sending the hapless man flying. "I…need to go. I'm fine. Don't worry about me" He stood, and although the loss of blood made him dizzy for a second, eventually his vision cleared and he straightened. His servant watched from a corner, looking as though he wanted to interfere, but didn't dare.</p><p>"I'm going out, Kiro. I probably won't be back until tomorrow." He searched, found his short sword, and strapped it on before leaving the room. He swiftly made his way to the entrance of the large house, and was heading to the stables when he saw a horse and rider crossing the courtyard. It looked like one of his soldiers keeping guard at the gates.</p><p>By the time he reached the stables, the man had dismounted and was lowering his tired horse's head to the water trough. He turned and saw Tarou, brightening visibly. "My lord!"</p><p>"You come with news?" the prince asked.</p><p>The sentry nodded. "Yes, lord. The Jiyan king just recently crossed through the Dara gates. He was on a horse. "</p><p>Tarou stilled, unable to believe his luck, then reached out and grabbed the man by his collar. "The Jiyan king? Do you mean <i>Genma</i>?" The poor sentry nodded quickly. "He's in Dara?" The sentry nodded again. "Alone?" Another affirmative. Tarou released the man.</p><p>"Show me where he went."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Mousse flapped his wings and flew above the crowds milling at the Daran gates below him, all of them waiting to enter the Black City. He couldn't be bothered to wait down there with the chattel. Of course, being Kunou's right hand man would have given him instant access, but it had been impossible to carry clothes in his duck state, and it would be hard to explain to the guards why Kunou's chief wizard had been in the desert naked.</p><p>Besides, he was so close now. Close to his quarry. Ranma. Ever since Ranma had turned back into a male, it had been easy for Mousse to track his soul energy, and Ranma had made it even easier by coming to Dara. Mousse concentrated, and to his delight, the energy seemed to be coming from the north. He raised his beak. If he could have smiled, he would have.</p><p>It looked like Ranma was already in the palace.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Genma made his way into the coffeehouse, scowling at the serving maid who approached him.</p><p>"Give me some of your best sherbet, and be quick about it!" he snapped. He grinned nastily as she fled. The crossing of the desert had given him a mighty parched throat, but he was close to his goal, he knew it! If those Arun scum thought they could keep Ranma, the prize Genma had killed and maimed for, then they had another think coming!</p><p>Ranma belonged to him, to do with as he pleased. And once this was all over, he would drag the boy back to Jiya and lock him up in the dungeons for a month for allowing himself to get caught. And, he grinned evilly, he would likely give some of the boy-loving guards a chance at Ranma as well. He knew how much the boy had hated Jso. Yes, that would be his punishment for being so weak as to get captured.</p><p>Genma completely ignored the fact that he had been captured too. He found a table in a corner, and hooking his foot around a seat, pulled it toward him and sat in it, relaxing. Ahhh, it felt good to sit. He wondered if Akane was with Ranma. Unlikely. She must have been murdered back in the palace during the Arun raid. Pity. She could have used a taste of the dungeon too.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ukyou grunted as she tightened her arm around the palace guard's neck, squeezing until he fell unconscious to the ground. Quickly, she slipped out of her green dress, and pulled on his uniform, wrapping his turban closely around her face to prevent recognition.</p><p>"I feel so much better dressed as a boy again," she whispered to herself. "There's gotta be somethin'wrong about that."</p><p>She glanced around as she pulled him under a bush and tied him up. The palace grounds were huge, and she had to find her way around. She knew Ranma and Akane were here somewhere, but where?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Nodoka leaned wearily against the horse seller's stall, tired of arguing. She was trying to buy three horses that would take her, Nabiki, and Kasumi out of Dara and into the north- the sooner the better. After hours of searching, she'd finally found a stable that was within her price range, but it was too late. The horse seller insisted that he couldn't sell his horses before morning, and she didn't have enough money for a decent bribe AND the horses.</p><p>"Very well, I'll be back at first light," she growled. The horse seller bowed to her, and closed his stall window in her face. She sighed, and walked out.</p><p>Cologne was hopping down the street towards her on her stick, a look of deep discouragement in her face. "I've been asking everyone for hours," she said. "I've been everywhere, but no luck. I have no idea where to find Shampoo."</p><p>Nodoka felt as though her own discouragement was reflected in Cologne's face. She sighed again. "Come, let's go find some supper. Kasumi and Nabiki will have found some at the inn."</p><p>Cologne nodded and fell inbeside Nodoka.</p><p>Walking back to the inn, Nodoka was lost in thought, the familiar scenes of life in Dara flowing around her. Here a woman was locking up her courtyard door, chattering to her servant. There, three men stood chewing tobacco and talking about the day as they sipped their cheap sherbet. A flower seller sat slumped in a doorway, sleeping, using her nearly empty flower basket as a pillow.</p><p>The sight brought a quick rush of memory to Nodoka, and she stopped. Uncertainty hit her, but she was staying till dawn anyway. Another few hours were unlikely to matter.</p><p>"Cologne."</p><p>"Yes?" The tiny old woman hopping beside her looked up with sad eyes.</p><p>"I think I know a way to find Shampoo."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kunou's body was carefully arranged in bed, but he couldn't sleep. It had taken six men to carry him there, as it usually did. He stared at his left hand, wondering when it, too, would turn to black marble like the rest of his body.</p><p>At last, Nodoka's bloodline was in his reach! It was time for the prophecy to be completed. Tomorrow, he would regain his form and get revenge on Nodoka and her clan! His plans were coming to fruition.</p><p>He raised his head as the doors to his apartment opened without warning. Mousse, dressed in long white robes, his hair falling in two black wings down his shoulders, entered, his head bowed.</p><p>Kunou smiled. "Mousse! You've returned from Jiya. How was the Arun raid?"</p><p>"It was very successful, as I am sure you already know, my king," Mousse purred. "Most of the Jiyans were captured, or were killed. A few ran away. In fact, I can sense Ranma's essence within these walls."</p><p>"Yes, he's here," Kunou answered. "He's my guest, as a matter of fact, along with Akane."</p><p>Mousse jerked his head. "Akane is here? Ranma is your GUEST?"</p><p>"That is correct. It seems they discovered I had set the raid in motion, and they raced across the desert to demand answers. How delightful. Such determined youngsters."</p><p>"And what did you tell them?"</p><p>"The truth, of course! I explained my sad condition to them. They don't know what to think!"</p><p>Mousse regarded Kunou with unease. "The truth? All of it?"</p><p>Kunou threw his head back and laughed. "No, dear boy. The truth, like sweet wine, can only be imbibed a little at a time."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The next morning, Akane woke up to soft knocking. The unlikely feel of soft cotton sheets beneath her made her spring up. Then she remembered Kunou and his palace. And Ranma's visit the evening before. She touched a finger to her lips, remembering. The memory made her flush, and she shoved it from her mind.</p><p>The knock sounded again, and a veiled maid servant dressed in a white vest and filmy harem trousers entered, carrying a tray.</p><p>"Good morning, my lady," she greeted Akane, dipping her head respectfully, and placing the tray on a small table. It contained a large covered dish, a silver pitcher and a silver tumbler. There was also a large envelope propped against the pitcher.</p><p>Curiosity pinched Akane, and she lifted the envelope. "What is this?" she asked.</p><p>The maid shook her head. "I'm sorry my lady, I don't know. All I know is that it's from the king. But I've brought you breakfast."</p><p>Akane ripped open the envelope and scanned the contents quickly. She read it again, more slowly.</p><p>"The King of Dara, Kunou Tatewaki, requests the pleasure of your company at dinner tonight, to complete his tale. Ranma Saotome is also invited."</p><p>Akane thought quickly. "Can I go out of my room during the day today?" she asked the maid.</p><p>The maid shook her head, and looked toward the slightly open door. Akane looked as well, and saw that the guard was still posted. "Very well," she said. "I accept, if Ranma does."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Well well well...whatis Kunou going to tell them? All the little chess pieces are gathered...it's time to put them into play!Roja.</p>
