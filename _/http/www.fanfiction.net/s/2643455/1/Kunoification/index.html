</div><p><b>Kunoification</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i></p><p><u><b>Prologue</b></u></p><p>"Ah, my vibrant  Pigtailed Goddess! To what do I owe thy honor of your divine and  radiant presence?"</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Nabiki  stopped and turned around. Nabiki withheld her chuckle in deference  to a poker face while Akane growled and Ranma simply sighed. "School,  maybe?"</p><p>"Indeed, for it is a  necessary evil, but I suspect that the true reason is so that you may  bask in the glow of my noble presence." Kuno suffused in a manner  that was entirely too full of himself.</p><p>Nabiki almost felt  sorry for Ranma, who had managed to get splashed on the way to  school. Normally they would have made a pit stop at Doctor Tofu's,  but they were already too close to school to even consider the walk  back. 'Almost' was the operative word in this equation, however,  as Nabiki happily collected the morning wagers. Those consisted of  not whether Ranma would win the inevitable fight against the deranged  kendo practitioner, but how long it would take for Saotome's  patience to expire and how far Ranma's can of whoop ass would send  Kuno across the schoolyard.</p><p>"Back off, Kuno. Not  in the mood." There was no room for interpretation contained within  Ranma's ultimatum, but if you were an eighteen-year-old kendoist  with a tendency to hold reality at arms length, there was plenty of  space to read between the lines.</p><p>"The wretched  Saotome's magics are indeed potent!" Tatewaki huffed  indignantly. "Very well! I shall date thee and purge you of his fowl  influence!" From that moment on, things happened like clockwork.  Kuno lunged for a glomp, only to be intercepted by Ranma's foot,  which catapulted the upperclassman across the schoolyard. Nabiki  nodded to one of her lackeys and a girl ran out with a tap measure,  marking the distance from liftoff to touchdown.</p><p>"Honestly, Ranma…"  Akane rolled her eyes and Ranma shrugged. Nabiki began to dole out  money to the winners, yet something tugged at her thoughts. Something  was missing. She looked up from the stack of money she had collect  and over to Ranma and Akane, who were now walking off to class  unmolested.</p><p>It was a textbook  Ranma-Kuno engagement, so why is my brain ticking over like there's  something wrong? Nabiki wondered, finishing her transactions. Then it  clicked. It <i>was</i> a textbook Ranma-Kuno engagement… <i>If  Ranma had been a boy at the time.</i> Ranma's actions were Standard  Kuno Response Package 'B'—Remove Kuno from the general vicinity  in the least amount of time possible. Response Package 'A' was  normally reserved for him as a boy; toying with Kuno a bit <i>before</i>  removing him from the general vicinity. But Kuno… Kuno was missing  something. Something that could affect her financial future.</p><p>"What's wrong,  boss?" Seiya stepped up to her employer, noticing the look of  intense concentration. It reminded her of a calculator crunching  numbers.</p><p>"Notice anything  unusual about the fight?" Seiya shook her head. "Akane. He didn't  favor Akane once during the entire exchange."</p><p>The girl blinked,  replaying the incident in her mind. "You're right… Not one  word."</p><p>Nabiki contemplated the  ramifications and decided that it was probably the single biggest  event for Furikan behind Ranma actually choosing a fiancée.  Kuno? Settle on one girl? And Ranma no less? The middle Tendo savored  the irony and sprung into action. "Seiya, I want his schedule for  the next week. The more specifics you dig up, the bigger your bonus."  The long haired brunette nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>"And keep this <i>quiet</i>."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"The Park at Seven."<p>Nabiki stared at the  note for probably the hundredth time since Seiya had dug up the  information two days ago. Their search had turned up remarkably  little information, save the time, date and location she now held in  her hand. Her associates bonus hadn't necessarily been a large one,  but had been sizable enough to ensure her continued silence. Normally  the Ice Queen would have contracted one of her helpers for stakeout  work, but this was priority stuff. You don't trust priority stuff  to henchmen… or hench<i>women</i>, for that matter.</p><p>So where was he? Nabiki  squinted in the diminishing light that was the dusk sky. The days  were getting longer and the park was popular in the evenings, which  meant she had some work ahead of her. Or maybe not, she thought as  her searching eyes locked onto a shadowy figure. No mistaking that  profile. But there was somebody with him? Definitely female, but  there wasn't enough contrast between her form and Kuno's to get  an ID. The middle Tendo skirted the edge of the park now, determined  to attract as little attention as possible while getting close enough  to find out who this woman was that Kuno was apparently familiar  with, and what- if anything –she had to do with Akane and Ranma.</p><p>Nabiki crept behind a  nearby bush and palmed the recorder in her pocket. The two remained  silent for a moment, evidentially simply content to enjoy the other's  presence. That's okay. The Tendo was patient. Not that she had long  to wait.</p><p>"The movies tonight,  my Goddess?" Nabiki smirked. Typical Kuno. The girl's reply,  however, drove a wooden stake straight through the Ice Queen's  brain and destroyed reality as she knew it. Turned it upside down.  Shook it sideways. Then ate it for lunch.</p><p>"Nah, let's just  walk around for a bit, Tachi." It wasn't that there was anything  offensive in her reply, it was just… Impossible. She recognized  that voice. Its characteristic lilt. They were words that should have  never been uttered by that voice. Nabiki had to be certain, and  tailed them as they walked slowly through the park as lovebirds were  wont to do. She shivered. Just not these two particular lovebirds.  Finally, they had progressed to a better lit area of the park and  Nabiki's suspicions were confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt. A  slight gasp escaped her lips, enough to earn the attention of  Tatewaki Kuno and his date. Red hair. Blue eyes. A full head shorter…</p><p>Ranma Saotome.</p><p>Tatewaki's face took  on a perturbed expression and Ranma's turned similarly bland.  "Don't you have something better to do, Nabs?"</p><p>The middle sister  recovered from her shock quickly. There was, of course, a logical  explanation to this. With that thought firmly fixed in her mind, she  took on her characteristic mercenary smirk. The situation was obvious  now. Ranma wanted something from Kuno. A cure. A map to a cure.  Something <i>big</i>. Big enough for him to cozy up to the  upperclassman using her female form. And she was playing the part too,  with his unbound hair and feminine blouse/dress combination. Even jewelry. "This  is <i>so</i> going to cost you Saotome."</p><p>Kuno dug his wallet out  of the casual jacket he wore and Nabiki absently noticed that he  cleaned up fairly nice when he wasn't running around in his  kendoist idiot mode. Slacks. A nice button down shirt. It was almost  enough to make her reconsider her opinions of him… If he wasn't  already patently insane. Nabiki was about ready to name the amount  when the redhead's hand reached out, gently blocking Kuno's  progress. He eyed her with an arched eyebrow.</p><p>"Not tonight, Tachi."</p><p>Kuno was only slightly  surprised. Nabiki was even more surprised. They had all played this  game enough times. Money bought Nabiki's silence. No money, no  silence. And if the rumor ever spread that Ranma was going out with  Tatewaki…</p><p>He seemed to comprehend  the dynamic as well. "Are you sure? It's only a minor  inconvenience."</p><p>Of course it was,  Nabiki thought. He could <i>burn</i> thousand yen bills and it'd still be  only a minor inconvenience, if that. Granted, she <i>could</i> charge  more, but there was a fine line to be walked between public servant  and public enemy. Still, the fact that it was Ranma blocking the  natural order of things was...</p><p>"You <i>do</i>  realize what would happen if news of your little date here got out…?"  Ranma shrugged and Nabiki nearly staggered.</p><p>"You're going to  tell them I'm going on a date with Kuno?" Nabiki nodded, trying  to look all business despite the uncertain footing she was on. "And  who would believe you again?" Nabiki pulled out a disposable camera  from her purse and snapped a picture, to which Ranma sighed. "Right."</p><p>"You're refusal  doubled the amount, Saotome." Kuno simply watched the pair debate.  "You might want to let your boy toy pay up." The calculated sting  her words were designed to invoke never hit home.</p><p>"Double of nuthin'  is still nuthin', Nabs."</p><p>Nabiki did a mental  double-take. What the hell was going on here? Ranma should be  defending his masculinity to the hilt and using Kuno's blind spot  concerning the pigtailed girl to do it, yet neither was happening.  Time to break out the big guns. "What would your father say if he  found out?"</p><p>"I believe you  already threatened that, Miss Tendo." Kuno pointed out with a hint  of amusement. Those words did more to turn Nabiki's gut to ice than  any anomaly in Ranma's attitude. They hinted at something that  should have been absolutely impossible. More impossible than finding  Ranma here tonight.</p><p>"You <i>know?"</i></p><p>It was Kuno's turn to  smirk. "Of course, Miss Tendo. I'd have to be insane not to."</p><p>This comment earned him  an elbow to the ribs courtesy of the smaller redhead. "You still  are."</p><p>The upperclassman  sniffed with amusement. "Quite possibly. But suffice to say, yes I  do know."</p><p>"But if you know…"  Nabiki's head began to spin as the ramifications landed on her like  a ton of bricks. "And Ranma is a girl…"</p><p>Ranma leaned into Kuno  a bit and looked up at him "I think she's getting it."</p><p>"Verily." He  agreed.</p><p>She shook her head as  if to clear it… "You… And Kuno… An <i>item?</i>" One really  couldn't blame the incredulity seeping into her voice. After all,  Nabiki Tendo had started this week going after the second biggest  story in Furikan High. Now she had both the first <i>and</i> second  right here in front of her. Screw the blackmail; the amount of money  this information could be sold for would be insane by itself! She  checked the tape player on reflex, ensuring it was still running.  Good. Nabiki blinked and the recorder was gone from her grasp. "Hey!"</p><p>Ranma tossed the  offending device into the air and obliterated with a tiny ki blast  that shot from her fingers like a pistol. Sparkles rained down in  contrast to the darker evening sky. "Oops?"</p><p>"Oops?" She  squealed, then glared at the diminutive redhead. "That was a top of  the line DAT recorder! I hope you realize that how much you owe me  just jumped. Big time!" Ranma simply gave her a bored look and it  took her a moment to figure out why. Oh yeah, she thought with dark  irony. Her boyfriend is Mister Money Bags. <i>Her boyfriend</i>.  Nabiki kicked the thought around in her head. That was just so many  ways to wrong it wasn't even funny.</p><p>"I believe we should  leaveth Miss Tendo to her conundrum." Kuno commented and began to  pull a smirking Ranma away from the girl.</p><p>"Indeedth." She  quipped with amusement and followed his lead.</p><p>Nabiki stood there in  muted shock as they walked away before finally regaining her  composure. "WAIT!" The couple paused. "Okay, you win! But I  have to know!"</p><p>Kuno seemed to consider  this before looking to Ranma. "It is your date night, Ra-chan. It  is up to thee."</p><p>Ranma pursed her lips,  trying to decide if they should even waste the time. "Hell, why  not? Otherwise she'll be stalking us all night long. But over  something to eat. I'm starved."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So for how long…?"<p>Kuno had picked a nice  seafood place by the river. While he could have gone more expensive  as he usually did on their dates, he recognized the delicate balance  between Ranma's hunger and her patience. Besides, he had learned a  while ago that she didn't necessarily care for such niceties. He  did, however, and made it a point to take her to the finer  establishments. He looked at Ranma, who was greedily sucking down  some breaded shrimp. "Three months?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and  finished off another shrimp. "Sounds about right."</p><p>"You're like this  after only <i>three months</i>?" Nabiki fought hard to keep her  cool. Manly man Ranma Saotome in a blouse, makeup and jewelry in  three months? The sister really began berating herself for having  missed the boat so badly.</p><p>"No, no, of course  not." Ranma returned, pausing in her mass calorie intake. "'Cides,  it's date night."</p><p>Kuno answered the  obvious look of confusion plastered on Nabiki's face. "She only  partakes of the finer raiments when we go out. As for our  relationship, it commenced approximately one year whence."</p><p>"But only got serious  three months ago." The redhead clarified.</p><p>Nabiki nibbled at the  plate of shrimp Alfredo pasta she had ordered. The whole situation  was just… Alien. "But <i>how</i>… Even better, <i>Why!"</i></p><p>"If Tachi here didn't  already have gobs of money, I'd be chargin' ya for that info."  Ranma sniffed, again clearly amused.</p><p>"Perhapse you still  should." Kuno commented with a smile. Come to think of it, Nabiki  never recalled seeing a real smile on his face. A maniacal insane  grin that indicated nobody was home upstairs, yes. But a genuine  smile? Uh-uh.</p><p>"Nah." Ranma waved  the suggestion away. "'Cides, you know what I think of money."</p><p>"Indeed, my fiery  Goddess." Kuno smiled warmly "It is one of your nobler traits. So  where would Miss Tendo like us to start?"</p><p>Nabiki barely  suppressed a shiver. "Uh, I guess the beginning?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes:</b>  How to get Kuno and Ranma-chan together without the use of drugs, koi  rods, mind altering magic, bumps on the head, locking Ranma as a girl  from the very beginning, pressure points and any other similarly used  plot device…? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that is the challenge.  Your first question might be "Exactly why are you taking time away  from Ah! My Ranma ½ and The Best of Times, Ozz?" Well  there's a perfectly good explanation for that.<p>Ferrets stole my brain.</p><p>It's the honest to  God's truth. That, and I've had this itch to do it for some time,  partly because there are so few out there to begin with. <b>TriMatter</b>,  on the other hand keep his safe in tubberware. Brains, not ferrets.</p><p><i>Special Thanks</i>  to <b>TriMatter</b>, as the brainstorming we came up with has really  resulted in a better fic.</p>
