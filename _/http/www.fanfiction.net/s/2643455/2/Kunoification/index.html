</div><p><b>Kunoification</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i></p><p><u><b>Chapter One</b></u></p><i>Eleven Months Ago…</i><p>How do you define a  typical day for Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes School of  Martial Arts? For most people, a typical day would not involve  copious amounts of property damage, life and death duels with rivals and dodging fiancées as if they were bullets. The analogy  between fiancées and bullets was more accurate than most  people realized, as both would just as soon kill Ranma Saotome even  as they tried to marry him.</p><p>The fiancées,  that is. Not the bullets.</p><p>There was one girl in  Ranma's complicated life that wasn't exactly chomping at the bit  for a marriage certificate, and that was Akane Tendo. Like the  pigtailed boy, she had been forced into the same arrangement by her  well meaning, but ultimately self-centered father. It wasn't  exactly a surprise that every time she heard the words "join the  schools", it was like a tiny dagger to the back. No, let's make  that a short sword to the back. Sometimes a claymore, depending on  the day and the stupidity of the scheme being employed for the  couples' own well being. The wedding party disaster just happened  to be a +5 Black Heart Avenger to the back, a broadsword used in the  Feyrun-Orgrimar Campaigns with the insidious reputation of sucking  the very life-essence out of its victim. Thankfully, Akane had rolled  successfully against the save versus breakup and their relationship  survived. Mostly. There were days when both Ranma and Akane could see  the light at the end of the tunnel and that maybe, <i>just maybe,</i>  they could dispense with all the idiocy and chaos once and for all.</p><p>Today was not one of  those days.</p><p>"Prepare to die,  Ranma!" This was rapidly becoming the standard greeting throughout  Nerima, as it had been heard so often that its residence had since  adopted it as their own. Of course, it was more often than not the  chosen greeting of a certain bandanna'd martial artist with unique  propensity for becoming lost in the most unlikely of situations.  Unique, as in most people tend not to get lost in the bathroom. Or  the hallway closet. And those who do usually don't find themselves  in India moments later. Ryoga Hibiki, however, was just good like  that. And like the lottery or some other random game of chance, Ryoga  would occasionally find himself back in Nerima, normally just long  enough to say 'hi' to Akane, have a few snacks and blame his  entire, miserable existence on the pigtailed boy. Indeed, he had  managed to complete his first two objectives quite handily, and now  it was time for the third out of the way, if only for tradition's  sake.</p><p>"I've seen Hell because of you!"</p><p>…Which was an  interesting statement to make, since the majority of people who have  actually seen hell usually did so in a dead-as-a-doornail capacity.  Not Ryoga, though. Oh no. Again, one might think that it was an  exaggeration that the Hibiki had actually seen hell. You know, a play  on words or some other amusing punch line. Again, they would be sadly  mistaken. The lost boy had actually <i>seen</i> hell. Had the  postcard to prove it. Signed by the dark lord himself, in fact, with  the tag line, "Wish you were here!"</p><p>Ah, the irony.</p><p>"Get lost, P-chan!"  Ranma growled in annoyance as his lunch was interrupted. It was  something you learned upon casual association with the best martial  artist in Japan… never come between a Saotome and his food. The two  engaged in the usual pre-brawl witty banter, which invariably drew  Akane into the conflict as well. It was somewhat of a mystery that.  She was Ranma's fiancée. Ryoga was a nice boy. And somehow,  any argument that the two engaged in invariably resulted in her  coming down on the side of the nice boy instead of the person she was  likely to spend the rest of her life with. It was an issue that  ticked Ranma off to no end. It was also a good thing that  Alkari consumed a good portion of Ryoga's time these days,  regulating their brawls to something more in keeping with tradition than  anything else. That, and Ranma just had to die.</p><p>"Honestly, Ranma! Why  do you two always fight?" Akane protested indignantly, words which  would initiate a cataclysmic series of events normally associated  with that of a collapsing star into a black hole, from which no  sanity can escape. This Nermian black hole had a tendency to suck in  any matter within the immediate vicinity, including, but not limited  to other rivals and fiancées. And everybody knows what's at  the heart of a black hole…</p><p>Chaos.</p><p>Also at the heart of  this mass of chaos was pressure. Pressure that affected the lives of  everybody caught within its influence and that that pressure was  especially great for Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo. Without this  chaos, it was conceivable that these two may have already been  married. At very least openly affectionate toward one another. But  throw in two parents, one uninhibited Chinese  Amazon, another overbearing childhood friend turned fiancée,  followed by a psychotic stalker gymnast and you had the ingredients  for a grade 'A' disaster. As if the total lack of privacy, rivals  and routine Invasion of the Akane Snatchers weren't enough.</p><p>Not that it was simply  everybody else's fault that Ranma and Akane simply couldn't get  it together. No, they had their own issues. Akane was stubborn and  naturally untrustworthy, having been scarred by a death and the  activities of the hentai horde of Furikan. This produced an ever  present simmering cauldron of malcontent which spilled all too easily  onto the men in her life. Ranma was also a project. The martial arts  training since the age of five years old wasn't a large  contributing factor in and of itself, but martial arts training at  the hands of <i>his father</i> was. By his hand, Ranma had developed the  social skills of a rock and a stubborn streak that dwarfed Akane's  tenfold. Simply put, he could be a serious ass at times. That, and it  never helped to have a water based, gender changing curse. Both Tendo  girl and Saotome boy were intrinsically good people, they just  desperately need to dump the matter-anti matter baggage they toted  through life.</p><p>That particular day  ended rather predictably. Ranma got glomped on, then proceeded to  stick his foot in his own mouth with an ill-advised comment  concerning his fiancées, which prompted the descriptive "jackass".  Therefore it came as no surprise when an uppercut was applied to the  martial artist's chin that would have made any number of Street  Fighter cast proud. Ranma disappeared into a patented spiral  and leveled out a mere three hundred feet before beginning a decent  that deposited him squarely into a body of water under the management  of a certain turtle.</p><p><i>Mister</i> turtle, that is.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"While I am honored  that you have come to profess your love to me, I must caution you  around my sister's pet." Kuno led the redhead into his mansion,  having provided her with a towel. "Fortunately, you are a nimble as  you are beautiful!"<p>Ranma shook her head.  Deranged idiot. "Look Kuno. I'm not here for a date, so get yer  hands off of me."</p><p>Kuno nodded, his face  hardening. "I see that Saotome's magics still hold considerable  sway! So be it, I shall smite him next I see thee!"</p><p>"Alright, that's  it. I'm gone." Ranma threw the towel off and began to head toward  the door… And promptly got lost in the huge mansion. "Dammit,  show me the door before a blast my way out!"</p><p>"Why would thou wish  to leave my most noble presence?" He asked, totally oblivious as to  the stress he was causing.</p><p>"Why?  WHY?"  Ranma's temper spiraled out of control. Few would have believed  what Ranma kept bottled inside for the sake of everybody around him.  She was sick of fiancées. She was sick of meddling parents. She  was sick of rivals. She was sick of Evil Villains. Hell, he was  getting sick of fighting in general. And the crap just kept piling  higher and higher and higher. Ranma needed an outlet at that very  moment, an outlet he could safely expend all her venom on without  fear as to who's feelings she would destroy in the process..</p><p>Needless to say,  Tatewaki Kuno was a convenient target.</p><p>"Because you're  like everybody else, that's why!" The redhead exploded in a  fury eclipsed Akane's by several magnitudes. "Can't I have just  one moment of peace without somebody trying to marry me or fight me?  Is that too much to ask? I don't want a date and I don't want to  get married… TO ANYBODY!" The kendoist looked as if he were about  to interject and she cut him off hard. "And YOU! You and your damn  sister are the worst of the bunch! 'Pigtailed' this and 'goddess'  that! Get it through you thick skull that there is no 'foul  sorceror'! He doesn't even enter into the picture!" Ranma ran  out of breath and gulped down another, her fury in fine form.  "GODDAMMIT! WHY CAN'T ANYBODY JUST LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE?"</p><p>Kuno stepped back, his  eyes widening in shock. "I… I see."</p><p>"No you don't! You  never see! Nobody does! I'm engaged to three separate people for a  total of five who won't take 'no' for an answer! Probably more,  knowing ol' Pops." The anger began to spin down as an empty  feeling took its place. "Dammit, I just want some peace."</p><p>Tatewaki stared at the  object of his affections for a moment, then his chest puffed out.  "Then that you shall have, my pigtailed Goddess!" Her head  snapped up, eying Kuno dangerously. "My doors are open to you, day  or night. I shall provide you with a key as such."</p><p>"I said I don't  want no date, baka!" Ranma growled as she began to rapidly move  into the physical harm phase of her frustration.</p><p>"Nor shall this  arrangement be one." The upperclassmen clarified in a statesman  like manner. "It hath become clear to me that an active woman such  as thyself needs a place of peace, an honor that would be mine to  provide thee."</p><p>Ranma's eyes narrowed  on the kendoist as he had just accurately pushed the one hot button  that would give her pause in this situation. "Peace and quiet?"</p><p>"If that is your  desire, it shall be yours."</p><p>Ranma chewed on the  idea some more. No. There's no possible way it could work. But  then… Nobody would <i>ever</i> looked for her here. And even if he  had to be a girl to do it, a moment to herself was worth its weight  in gold at this point. No, still wouldn't work. After all, there  was exactly one fatal flaw in such a lofty daydream… Kuno. Or  Kunos, rather. Ah well. It was a nice idea while it lasted.  Regardless, her next words would have to be carefully spoken. After  all, saying 'no' to a Kuno outright was like pouring gasoline on  their delusional pyres.</p><p>"Ok, I'll  stay….BUT," Ranma tacked on the conditional before Kuno gush  enthusiastically concerning his good fortune. "If you so much as  hang on me or ask me out on a date, I'm gone. I ain't your girl  friend, so don't go saying I am one. And keep that sister of yours  away from me." There, Ranma smiled inwardly. There's no way he  could possibly keep all those promi—</p><p>"Done." Kuno  confirmed solemly, causing Ranma to blink furiously.</p><p>"What?" He… He  agreed!</p><p>"I see now that it is  not merely the Evil Saotome plaguing thee, but they obligations of  thy family." Kuno gained a thoughtful look through the explanation.  "Indeed, it is something I have much experience with. That, and I  shall not have such a dishonor visit my name by driving you back into  the Saotome's bed."</p><p>"You say another word  about Saotome or Sorcerer again, and I'm goner than gone." Ranma  growled.</p><p>"Verily, they hath  cause enough stress. I shalln't cause any more by speaking of  them." The upper class man acquiesced, mollifying Ranma somewhat.</p><p>"Then what about—"</p><p>"<i>OOOOHH  HohohohohoHO!</i>" The sound turned Ranma's veins to ice. No. No WAY  could she deal with that woman right now. "I see my brother has  finally ensnared another woman with his charms, and so fortunate it  should be you!"</p><p>Kodachi looked entirely  too smug. "He ain't ensnared nothin'!"</p><p>"I shall allow this  arrangement, brother, as it suits my purposes grandly." Now Ranma  stared at her in shock. Kuno, with his intimate knowledge of how his  sister operated, stood by warily. "While your choice in women  leaves something to be desired, it does leave the Stallion Ranma all  to myself! OH HOHOHohohohOOHO!" The black haired girl's ever  present gymnastics ribbon snapped out and Ranma's hand moved to  intercept it, instead catching a solid object between her fingers. A  key? "Do not journey into the east wing pigtailed one, or it could  mean your life!" With that final warning, the gymnast spun around  and erupted into a flurry of black rose pedals, vanishing from sight.</p><p>Ranma stared at the  key, then Kuno himself, unsure as to whether she should be happy to  have Kodachi out of her hair or steamed that she was just mistaken as  Kuno's girlfriend.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So who else knows?"  Nabiki questioned the couple before Kuno could hand the telling off  to Ranma.<p>Ranma shrugged.  "Ko-chan... I think Kasumi suspects."</p><p>"Ko-chan?" Nabiki  cocked her head and Ranma slightly, but refused to drop any hints.  "Ko-chan, Ko-chan, KODACHI!" She about choked on the drink she  had been nursing. Ranma's smile widened. "You actually became  friends with <i>her?</i> How many times has she tried to drug you?"</p><p>"More times than I  can count." Ranma stated without hostility. "But once she no  longer saw me as competition it just happened over time. Definitely  not over night, mind you. I retained peasant status with her for  quite some time after that in her eyes."</p><p>The middle sister  rubbed her temples as if to ward off a headache. Her world was  changing so quickly it boggled the mind. "How could I have not seen  it coming?"</p><p>"Aw, don't beat  yourself up too badly." Ranma sympathized. "If I don't wanna be  followed by your people, I ain't gonna be followed. As for Tachi  here…"</p><p>"…I know many of  your associates on a first name basis, Miss Tendo." Kuno let a  slight smile of his own lips. "Money buys silence as well as  information, a fact I am sure you are well acquainted with."</p><p>"You've been buying  my people off?" It wasn't that outlandish a concept, but…but...</p><p>"A trivial task with  my financial reserves." Kuno confirmed and the fact deflated Nabiki  visibly. She had been played, and it was a numbing realization.</p><p>"When did he get so…  so calculated?'" She turned to Ranma, who chuckled in turn.</p><p>"Since we started  hangin' out to together, of course." The redhead replied, to  which Kuno agreed. "I ain't the most well-read person in the  world or Kuno the sanest, but we kinda balance each other out."</p><p>"Well, you are one of  the more sane people I've met, Saotome, even if your life is totally  <i>insane</i>." Ranma and Kuno stared at Nabiki. "What, aren't  I allowed to compliment somebody occasionally?"</p><p>"Not without charging  'em." Ranma commented dryly.</p><p>Nabiki let the remark  slide. "Fine then, I'll put it on your tab. Happy?"</p><p>"Better." Kuno  replied, and the trio ordered drinks as Ranma continued the story.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>There were many events  that bore a close resemblance to The Second Wedding, namely those  associated with The Second Impact, giant mecha and mass destruction.  While no Angels came into play during the second attempt to wed Ranma  and Akane, fiancées and rivals did. How did such a joyous  occasion result in eight square blocks of ruined Nermian suburb? The  answer is quite simple…<p>Parents.</p><p>Well, one parent  actually. The likely suspects were Soun Tendo and Genma Saotome,  whose incessant interference into their children's lives usually  did more to push the couple apart than bring them closer. This time  around, however, there was a God in heaven and he blessed them with a  clue. Sure, they were still the catalyst for the events, but once  they began to take shape, they did what many believed to be  impossible… They backed off, giving Akane and Ranma some much  needed space. Even Nabiki learned from the last time around, though  her lesson was more one focusing on profit vs. property damage. She  had meddled the last time for personal gain and it blew up in her  face spectacularly. Sure, the initial monetary gains were outstanding… Until she began running up the damage tally. With the  dojo solidly in the red, Nabiki was found kicking herself for nearly  a month afterwards.</p><p>The fiancées had  been quiet too, at least at first. Ranma had made the rounds and  'settled up' weeks before the event. The Amazon contingent wasn't  pleased, but then there wasn't anything they could really do about  it. While Cologne had been the most cunning person he'd ever met,  she was also logical to the point of ruthlessness and held no  illusions as to what would happen if they forced Ranma "God-slayer"  Saotome's hand. Shampoo hadn't been happy about it, but once she  saw her great grandmother- the unflinching pillar –fold, she knew  it was over. Regardless, Cologne was more than happy to petition  Ranma to be a tribal ally, which he accepted with provisions to  continue in the Amazon arts.</p><p>Ukyo was the easiest of  the trio. She had known in her gut that this day had been a long time  in coming, being one of the most rational fiancées in waiting  for Ranma. It was was a tough evening when he made his rounds to her,  but it was also a two-ton weight lifted off both their chests. The  fact that Ranma vowed to repay her dowry also went along way toward  thinning any bad blood that might have resulted. Steps had been taken  via Nabiki to ensure that the Kuno's remained in the dark about the  wedding. She'd been unwilling to perform the service at first until  forcefully reminded that she owed not only her future brother in-law  a wedding that she was in-part responsible for destroying, but her  <i>sister</i> as well. Thus "persuaded", she commended Operation Take-Out, ensuring that the Kuno's would be stuck home all day  receiving food delivery from nearly every establishment in Nerima.  That, and Nodoka's ever-present katana was always a healthy motivator  to help out.</p><p>No, this time the tactical Nuclear weapon that would turn the second  wedding into ground zero came from a most unexpected direction…</p><p>The guests were getting  seated when Ranma and Akane were beckoned over by his mother. Behind  her sat Soun and Genma, both with wide grins plastered across their  face. No doubt, that had something to do with the large bottle of  saki on the table. Still, Ranma noted they were behaving, so what the  hell. Nodoka Saotome was positively beaming now that part of her  dream was about to be realized. With any luck, the other part would  be realized nine months from now. She considered the young couple  thoughtfully. No, she wasn't about to leave such an important  matter as her son's manliness and grandchildren to chance. If there was one thing she knew  about her child and his betrothed, it was that they weren't at that  point yet. They were friends. Almost good friends. But that spark  wasn't there yet; the spark that would complete her dream of  motherhood. But Nodoka knew how to ignite that spark and get exactly  what she wanted in the process…</p><p>Competition.</p><p>"What's up, Mom?"  Ranma smiled warmly at his mother. After all, there was nothing to  fear from this particular parent. The seppuku contract had been  fulfilled and he had been proclaimed a manly man, even as a woman.  Ok, so sometimes she tried to engage him in girl training, but other  than that, she was pretty harmless compared to the Old Man, who had  been amazingly well behaved as of late. Even so, both Akane and Ranma  eyed him warily. You just never knew…</p><p>"I would like to  introduce you to somebody." She stated with a smile and both were  curious now as a girl with long brown hair joined the trio. She was  clothed in a blue and black ceremonial kimono, had deep brown eyes  and a more than satisfactory figure, had Ranma been shopping around.  Of course, hadn't been shopping around for the last three years.  "This is Yumei Ikari." The three exchanged polite bows. Friend of  the family? "She is to be your mistress, Son."</p><p>Anybody within nominal  earshot either choked, fell face first into the floor or was forced  to pick their jaws up off the ground in utter disbelief.</p><p>"M-M-M-<i>MISTRESS!"</i>  Anybody who hadn't heard the word before certainly hear it this  time as Ranma gibbered wildly. Akane was now glowing a rosy shade of  pink.</p><p>"Of course, Ranma."  Nodoka Saotome explained, as if such events were perfectly natural.  "I cannot expect <i>merely</i> Akane to sate the manly urges of my  son, so Miss Ikari and I have come to an arrangement." Yumei  inclined her head slightly in agreement. Her cheeks weren't nearly  as pink as Akane's and she held her eyes on the pigtailed suitor  confidently. "Besides, you don't expect Akane to satisfy your  needs when she is eight months pregnant and nursing, do you?"</p><p>"MOM!" The  ruckus had gathered a small crowd now, including fiancées and  friends. "What are you DOING!"</p><p>"RANMA? What the  HELL is going ON!" Akane, who had managed a level of serenity  previously unheard of, snapped violently. Ranma winced, then turned  back to his mother and the girl.</p><p>"No way, Mom! This is  crazy!" He stepped up to the pair and Ranma's mother retained her  ineffable calm.</p><p>Nodoka waved the  protest away with a flick of her hand. "Nonsense. I will not have  my manly son wait for his wife to come around on his wedding night…  Unless you plan on bedding with him tonight, daughter in-law?"</p><p>Logical thought was  rapidly becoming a commodity in Akane Tendo's brain as the wedding  pressures they were so desperate to avoid crashed down upon them from  a totally unexpected angle. "HELL NO!" The background chatter  began to pick up in volume as events spiraled desperately out of  control</p><p>"Aiyaaah, Kitchen Destroyer not consummate marriage?"</p><p>"My Ran-chan <i>won't  </i>have a cold bed tonight, Sugar."</p><p>"Ranma, you had  <i>better</i> not be breaking Akane's heart!"</p><p>Truth be told, Ranma  and Akane were perfectly fine with this arrangement. Neither was  quite ready to go "there" yet and both agreed that they would  marry to satisfy honor first, where upon they could grow into their  new lives naturally. Obviously, Mother had other ideas.</p><p>"Then it is settled."  Nodoka decided with certainty. "Honor will be satisfied, the  schools will be joined, Ranma will be able spend his wedding night  properly and I'll have my grand babies."</p><p>"No! No! No! NO!"  Ranma fumed now. "Ain't gonna happen!"</p><p>"NO WAY!" Akane was  much further along on the rage curve than Ranma. "I'm not  entering into such… such a PERVERTED marriage!"</p><p>Genma and Soun put  their glasses down and stepped up beside Nodoka. They had been  content to steer clear of Nodoka's plans, but now a threat loomed  they could no longer ignore. "Boy, you will marry Akane!"</p><p>"Like hell I will!"  Ranma snapped. "Not like that!" Soun tagged in at that moment.</p><p>"Akane, honor must be  satisfied!" he stated firmly. "You will marry Ranma right this  instant!"</p><p>"You're all crazy!"  Akane bit back, and Nodoka's gaze hardened on them both.</p><p>"If you will not  marry my son, then I will be forced to switch the engagement." She  stated with an edge of steel in her voice. "Kasumi, Nabiki. Come  here."</p><p>Her voice left very  little room for negotiation and the two sisters hesitantly stepped  forward. "MOM, YOU CAN'T DO THIS!" He looked from the parents,  to Akane, who was now visibly glowing red with rage.</p><p>"Hush, child. This is  for your own good." Nodoka rebuked, then turned to the sisters.  "Which Tendo would like to step forward and claim my son's hand?"</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane  and she back at him. In that single moment, through both anger and  incredulity, they knew it. All hope for a normal life had just died  in the shared space between them, and with it, something more. It was  time to end it this farce. Ranma's mouth opened, but his final  ultimatum was preempted.</p><p>"Aiyah! Engagement to  kitchen destroyer off!" The bubbly Amazon bounded forward to claim  her prize. "Now free to marry Shampoo!"</p><p>A combat spatula halted  her advance as it bit into the ground in front of her. "If Ran-chan  is getting married today, it's going to be to me!"</p><p>Two short swords  whistled by Ranma's head and the martial aritist weaved to the  side, as they cleaved the wedding cake in half. Fitting symbolism,  Ranma thought as his world continued to crumble around him. "How  dare you try to reclaim Shampoo, Saotome!" Another sword sprang  from Mousse's white robe and the two engaged.</p><p>Ryoga took one look at  the tears falling from Akane's eyes and his anger soared out of  control. Ranma's life had hurt the person he now considered his  sister <i>again</i>, and he broke free of Akari's grasp, determined  to visit justice on the Saotome. "DAMN YOU, RANMA! Stop making her  cry!"</p><p>And with that  proclamation, the Second Wedding was crushed under a storm of ki,  melee weaponry and best of intentions.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was like any other  day for Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes School of Martial  Arts. It was a day full of property damage, rivals and fiancées;  the latter two sparing no hesitation in chasing him around the quaint  little suburb of Nerima in order to either marry him or kill him. He  even had a mistress chasing him now, of all things. There was only  one minor problem with this seemingly normal day, and that was that it was  supposed to be far from normal.<p>It was supposed to have  been his wedding day.</p><p>And <i>hers</i>, Ranma  revised silently as he abandoned the street and fled into a side ally  to bleed off pursuit. His mind was still numb with the fact that his  mother—His very own mother!—had just thrown him to the wolves and  destroyed EVERYTHING they had worked so hard to achieve in the name  of her twister vision of manliness! Dammit! Why couldn't they just  leave them alone? He had the fiancées locked down. The  fathers were behaving themselves for once. Akane was <i>willing</i>.  And who is the one that comes along and sabotages everything? Mom and  her goddamn mistress! The martial artist turned another blind corner  and leaped strait up, landing on the rooftop. More pursuers were  suckered off and he was down to the Wrecking Crew core that continued  to dog his trail.</p><p>They would take a bit  more to lose, Ranma knew. This was a game every player was used to  and after over two years of playing it, the one thing he could not  afford to do was be caught by any one of them. First, to be caught by  one was to be caught by <i>every</i> one of them. But there was a  second, more important reason to evade them… He was in serious  doubt of his self control at the moment. In fact, he was certain that  if confronted, somebody would get hurt. Possibly even one of the  girls. Badly. He was staving off the crushing pressure of depression,  but only barely. He needed time and privacy and if he didn't  get either in sufficient quantities to sort himself out soon, the  results would be… Catastrophic.</p><p><i>SPalloooOOSh!</i></p><p>Ranma barely noticed  the transformation as she automatically adjusted her new body's  center of gravity and balance. The cold water siphoned away a  fraction of the depression-leadened haze her brain was operating in  and a stray thought pierced the fog. <i>Kuno.</i> It had been roughly a  month since he had made the offer, and she had never seriously thought  about taking him up on it. Until today. Right now privacy and peace  were worth more to the redheaded martial artist than her weight in  gold. Nobody, but NOBODY would check <i>his</i> house. She'd have  to duck past the dojo to pick up the key, but if Kuno was good to his  word... And if not, he'd be the first to suffer when she snapped.</p><p>Her course decided, Ranma initiated her father's forbidden  technique and vanished.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I hath already told  thee that we did not order this food!" Tatewaki Kuno fumed at yet  another delivery boy trying to collect money from him. His sister  stepped up beside him in an elegant black ballroom dress strewn with embroidered roses.<p>"Do not insult us!"  Kodachi snapped at the boy, who was now cringing. "We would not  <i>touch</i> any food not served by an establish not rated<i> at least</i> five  stars, let alone <i>this</i>." Her disdain for the food in question  was clearly evident. The door slammed and the boy thanked God that he  had escaped unscathed.</p><p>Tatewaki shook his head  as the pair trudged back into the heart of the mansion. "There is  definite strangeness afoot today, little sister. I suspect evil  forces have aligned against the House of Kuno!"</p><p>"Truly, Brother. I  suspect it is the pigtailed harlot!" Kodachi nodded.</p><p>"Nay, it must be the  foul sorcerer Saotome!" Tatewaki countered, and the two stopped  short, glaring at one another.</p><p>"The Harlot!"</p><p>"The Sorcerer!"</p><p>"The Harlot!"</p><p>"The Sorcerer!"</p><p>Brother and Sister  pressed toward one another, nose to nose. An electric spark danced  violently between them as both refused to yield an inch from the  respective, if deluded, positions. Sasuke shook his head as he  watched from a concealed position. Well, they're going to have to  know eventually… The diminutive ninja faded into view beside the  siblings, who had yet to notice him.</p><p>"Ahem." Bother  refused to back down from their staring contest, so he just told them  from his kneeling position. "Master, you have a guest."</p><p>Tatewaki blinked, and  found the kneeling ninja. "A guest? For I was just at the door, how  is this so?" Kodachi was now smug with victory, yet she was curious  as well.</p><p>"<i>She</i> used the  back door."</p><p>It only took the  upperclassman a moment to realize the implication and his eyes lit  up. "My Pigtailed Goddess!"</p><p>"She has come to  gloat!" Kodachi's reaction was her brother's polar opposite.</p><p>"Where is thee  maiden?" It was a legitimate question as the mansion was absolutely  huge.</p><p>"Guest room twelve,  Master Kuno." Then he paused. "She is… unwell."</p><p>Tatewaki was off like a  shot down the hallway, his sister close behind for an entirely  different reason. Intimately familiar with the mansion, they found  guest room twelve easily. The kendoist's hand wrapped around the  doorknob and hesitated. Sobbing could be heard through the door  itself. He opened the door gently and there she was at the center of  the lavishly furnished room on the main couch, curled into a ball and  sobbing. The new draft created by the open door snapped her attention  up and her tear strewn eyes locked onto the boy. He watched as their  emptiness was quickly replaced by a towering inferno.</p><p>"GET OUT!" The  redhead shriek, lunging for the nearest solid object not nailed down.  "YOU PROMISED ME SOME DAMN PRIVACY! SO GET THE F&amp;$&amp; OUT!  NOW! AAHHHHAARR!" Her grasp found the end table lamp and it went  sailing. Tatewaki yanked the door closed just as the lamp shattered  against the opposite side with a broken thud. Another followed  closely after the first, causing the siblings to wince. The two  looked at one another and there was a silence, followed by the  renewal of sobbing moments later.</p><p>"Perhaps I shall let  the harlot be for now." Kodachi arched an eyebrow at the  spectacular display of rage.</p><p>"As I." Her brother  agreed, then gained a thoughtful look. "Sasuke!"</p><p>The cat-faced ninja  appeared beside Kuno as if teleported there. "Yes, Master?"</p><p>"Intercept any  sustenance bearers before they reach the front door." He commanded.  "Pay them a fair amount befitting a Kuno and send them on their  way. I'll not have bickering or the incessant ringing of a doorbell  disturb my Goddess in such a state."</p><p>"It shall be done,  Master Kuno."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma stepped into a  sparsely appointed room, that, while obviously large and spacious was  understated when compared to the rest of the house. It reminded Ranma  of a dojo given the minimal distractions and soothing earth tones. An  orchestral piece played in the background and Ranma found her vision  settling on the boy at the room's center—Tatewaki Kuno, painting  on a canvas, of all things. Kuno? Paints? The kendoist noticed a  change and looked up to find the redhead watching him from the  doorway.<p>Tatewaki Kuno gazed on  the object of his a affections for a moment before noticing the  details. Ranma's eyes were nearly as red as her hair, which stood to  reason given the fact that she had been crying for the last two hour.  Likewise, her clothing was complete disheveled, as if she had ran a  marathon or enraged in some form of violent activity... Or both.</p><p>"Er...um... Sorry  about the lamp." She began, shifting uncomfortably. Sure, this was  Kuno and no, they weren't the best of friends, but that didn't give  her any right to just chuck stuff around, Ranma figured, especially  after having accepted his invitation. That, and the lamp hadn't been  the only thing destroyed. Guest room twelve had some serious  remodeling scheduled for it in the near future.</p><p>Tatewaki looked on a  moment longer before speaking. "Verily, they are but possessions  and compare naught to your well being." He paused once more to size  up the redhead. "May I inquire thee as to what has so unsettled, my  pigtailed Goddess?"</p><p>On any other day, that  question would have earned the kendoist a sharp rebuke, if not a  severe pounding. Today, however, was the worst days of Ranma's life.  The battle with Saffron had come close, but he had helped Akane back  from the abyss and won. Today, Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything  goes school of martial arts had <i>lost. </i>Three  years of bitter rivalries, relationships and madness all for nothing  as that unspoken truth passed silently between the bride and groom to  be. They would never have peace or understanding, and each knew in  that moment even a wedding wouldn't change things. They would always  be at the mercy of their parent's manipulations. Now life as she had  known it for so long had fallen apart, and the man who stood against  the world didn't have a single shoulder to lean on or an ear to sympathize  with.</p><p>...Not  even her own mother.</p><p>"If it was the  foul-" Kuno's grousing was interrupted as Ranma snapped back.</p><p>"<i>It wasn't Ranma,  'kay!</i>" Kuno simply nodded. "It was my damn parents! They  ruined everything!"</p><p>"What did they do,  pray tell?"</p><p>In that moment, Ranma  totally forgot her current gender as the pain resurfaced in its  entirety. "They tried to fix me up with a mistress! A damn MISTRESS  if you can believe it! They ruined it for both Akane and me! Always  interfering in every $&amp; thing we do! I'm sick of it!"</p><p>Kuno bolted upright at  this new tidbit of information. "Truly? They would force you to  engage in unnatural relations with another? I would not suspect such  madness would grip a family as throughly as it has my own!"</p><p>"Damn right!" Ranma  continued heedlessly. "And Akane too! I swear they're absolutely  determined to ruin our lives! I must have no less than three separate  engagements because of my Pop, who won't give us a moment's peace.  And that's not counting Akane's father always harpin' on her!" She  thumped the plush chair with her fist. "And then my own MOTHER  pulls this mistress crap on one of the most important days of my  life!"</p><p>Kuno walked up to the  redhead took her hand, grasping it within his. The only reason she  didn't lay him out right then and there was that there was something  more to it than his unstable desire. His own eyes spoke of something  else... Understanding. "I know what thou art going through because  I have been there many a time." He stated with seriousness. "All  know the Kunos by our fearsome reputation, of course, but our family  has suffered a great malady for generations."</p><p>Ranma noted his serious  mask and couldn't help but to ask. "And what... 'Malady' is that?"</p><p>"Insanity!"</p><p>The redhead shot  offered him a dry look. "You don't say."</p><p>"I ask your  confidence in this delicate matter, my Goddess." Tatewaki continued  with all the gravity of a black hole. "Would people find out about  this hereditary condition, it might cause them to view the great  House of Kuno in a manner of bias."</p><p>"Doubt it."</p><p>"Your confidence in  our most noble family name is reassuring." Kuno nodded. "But be  that as it may, I know what thou art suffering though. I must be ever  on guard against my own father and sister and their petty scheming.  More than once such interference has brought ruin to my own life."</p><p>For a moment, Ranma's  own pain eased slightly as curiosity captured her. There was no doubt  that the upperclassman's hold on reality was still tenuous at best,  but there was also no doubt as to the fires he had been through, and  they were most similar to the ones she was experiencing at that very  moment. "How did you... Um, cope." Ranma almost kicked herself  for asking such a silly question. Obviously he had gone mad. Even so,  she wanted to hear the answer from his own lips, especially after a  day like today. What he said probably wouldn't even matter... Just  the fact that he was the sole ear in her life at the moment was what  the important thing..</p><p>"Truly there are days  all seems it seems hopeless." Kuno was looking at her, but not  truly seeing her. His gaze bore through her and into the space  beyond. "but then I remember my friends and loves of my life. Among  the most important of those are thee and Akane Tendo."</p><p>The redhead's thoughts  seemed to momentarily stumble. Akane and herself she could  understand, even if neither had ever returned even the remotest sense  of affection for the Kuno. Even that sent a slight pang of guilt  through her. But Kuno didn't <i>have</i> any friend. He had acquaintances  at best, and that circle didn't realistically include Ranma or Akane  regardless what his psychosis told him. Come to think of it, she was  pretty damn shy on friends herself. "So who else do you consider...  Your friend?"</p><p>"I would say the  Nabiki Tendo has seen me through many a troubled time." Kuno  stated, and Ranma nearly fell over.</p><p>"She charges you for  everything." Ranma pointed out. Hell, she charges <i>everybody</i>  for everything.</p><p>"It is a but a mask,  my beauticious one." Kuno explained the world as he knew it. "Her  line of work requires such, but I have never known her to be anything  less than fair and understanding."</p><p>Ranma blinked. <i>Okaaaay.</i>  I think that's enough of <i>those</i> questions. Though the answers  had been outlandish, they had succeeded in putting a dent in her  depression, if only because it was incredulity replacing it. That,  and there was the fact that she had somebody to spill her guts to <i>and</i>  somebody who had apparently been through similar circumstance. She  could almost even face the outside world again. In fact, it was  probably best she did. Couldn't leave Akane to face the wolves by  herself for too long, regardless of what the future held for them  ...Or didn't hold. "Um, thanks for the hospitality, Kuno, but I  can't impose on ya any-"</p><p>"Nonsense." he cut  her off abruptly. "You will stay for dinner."</p><p>"I will?" It was  another bit of the kendoist that rocketed past her normally raised  defenses thanks to the days' strain.</p><p>"Indeed! For some  reason we have run afoul the food service industry this day and have  plenty to spare." Ranma barely suppressed a flinch. Not that she'd  know <i>anything</i> about that, no sir.</p><p>"Um, couldn't you  just turn em away?" She inquired, another pang of guilt crawling  through her stomach.</p><p>"Such disagreements  would have assuredly disturbed the peace you sought." Kuno  explained as they now stepped from his painting room to the main  dining room, where stacks of food sat. "Nay, I could not allow  such. I surely cannot eat so much and my sister will not touch it."</p><p>Two concepts promptly  asserted themselves in Ranma Saotome's mind: Guilt and hunger. It was  surprising how well the two meshed together. There was a third that  swam below the surface, content to remain out of sight, and it was  the desire to retreat from the horrible life she had just taken  refuge from. The decision was a remarkably easy one to make.</p><p>"Aw, what the hell.  Let's dig in."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Yeah, I pretty much  figured that was the beginning." Nabiki sighed as they broke in  introspection. "It was either that or the dragon mistress  what's-her-name."<p>"Onyixa." Ranma  stated, leaning into Tatewaki's arms. Dragon girl just happened to be  one of the few kidnappers to frequent Nerima with an interest in  Ranma himself and not his fiancée. Scratch that, Nabiki  amended. <i>Ex-fiancée.</i>  It had been one of the more surreal kidnappings, if only because  nobody but the fiancées wanted to really go after Ranma. The  cajoling of the various factions to aid in his rescue was an  endlessly amusing process and when a rescue party was finally  assembled, it was surprised by Ranma stepping through the dojo  doorway, having rescued <i>himself</i>.</p><p>"So  what are you going to do about your mother?" Nabiki asked with a  nonchalant wave of her hand. "Hell, what are you going to do about  <i>Akane?</i> And the Amazons... And Ukyo... I stand to make a tidy  sum off of this."</p><p>"If  we let you." Tatewaki stated evenly and Nabiki blanched, unused to  Kuno actually being assertive. While she held an undoubtedly large  sphere of influence, it was tough to compete with somebody with  substantial cash reserves and who had a father that basically owned  the school. Part of her profession was recognizing that thin line in  just how far you could push people, and it seemed Tatewaki was  finally realizing the exact boundaries of that line instead of  continually allowing himself to be pushed across it.</p><p>"It  ain't that bad, Tachi." Ranma pointed out, looking up at her  boyfriend. "Might be able to help with damage control." Nabiki  nodded in agreement, seeing the glimmer of profit still salvagable.  Kuno didn't exactly look thrilled, but remained silent.</p><p>"Oh yeah, speaking of Akane..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's  notes:</b> Was originally planning one large story, but my fiancée  is coming from Indonesia, so I might not be able to put serious time  into these stories in the near future.
