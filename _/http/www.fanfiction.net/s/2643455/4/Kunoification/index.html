</div><p><u>Forward</u>: Some consternation has been expressed about switching from flashback to present scenes, and vice-versa. Aside from the line breaks to seperate scenes, changes in chronology will be indicated by <b>b</b>old <b>m</b>arkup at the beginning. It's the best method I could figure to indicated the change without using something more intrusive, like "FLASHBACK" or "THE PAST" Thanks ;)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Kunoification</b><br/>By <i>Ozzallos</i><p><b>Chapter 3 </b></p><p><b>T</b>o say Nabiki Tendo was  not an early morning person was to state a fact so obvious that one  would be forced to question the intelligence of anybody broaching the  topic in the first place. As such, the middle Tendo did not believe  in such euphuisms as 'Early to bed, early to rise' or the ever  more popular 'early bird gets the worm'. In fact, she was of the  sound opinion that such sayings were adopted by people looking to  substitute hard work for their lack  of intelligence. Since she had plenty of the latter, getting  up early was not only entirely unnecessary, it was just plain wrong;  Borderline evil, in fact, which said something about her eldest  sister.</p><p>Regardless of the  aforementioned facts and the potentially malicious nature of one  Kasumi Tendo, Nabiki was up early. The exact time had yet to be  determined by her sleep deprived brain, but she was certain the hour  was somewhere between 'damn early' and 'too damn early'. With  natural flow of her universe disrupted, the Tendo had no choice but  to brutally slap her protesting alarm clock into submission before  shrugging the covers aside to start her new, albeit early day. Of  course, there was only one thing all this nonsense about waking up at  the crack of dawn could lead to, and that thing wasn't necessarily  a good thing. It spoke in monosyllable words and had a nasty  temperament, and much like Akane's food; normally something to be  avoided at all costs.</p><p>Zombie Nabiki.</p><p>Very few tended to stay  in the presence of Zombie Nabiki for long, as her usually malevolent  tendencies toward black mail  and extortion were more pronounced during these unnatural hours,  assuming you weren't turned to stone after looking upon her  bloodshot eyes, frizzy hair, and wrinkled pajamas to begin with. The  favored method to dispatch Zombie Nabiki was not, contrary to popular  belief, a wooden stake and holy water. After all, she would only rise  again the next morning. While such a scheme would have been  gratifying to some parties- half the student body of Furinkan High,  for example -there was an imminently more effective technique by  which to neutralize the middle Tendo: mass quantities of caffeine. In  an emergency situation, one could sneak in and main line an IV  directly into a major artery, jump starting her nervous system and  bringing the girl's brain slowly back to life without the need for  an expensive stone slab, restraining cuffs, high power transformer,  switching arrays, banks of batteries, lightning rod, and the  obligatory thunder storm.</p><p>In most cases, the  prescribed emergency procedures were entirely unnecessary, as Nabiki  Tendo was more than happy to consume the required caffeine products  herself. The earlier she got up, the more she consumed, which would  explain why a very large mug of freshly brewed coffee was waiting on  the table for the shambling corpse to consume as she stumbled into  the dining room.</p><p>"Oh my, you're up  early."</p><p>Zombie Nabiki's hand  paused mere centimeters away from the mug of joe as she eyed her  older sister warily with those dead, <i>dead</i> orbs of hers. It was  early and Nabiki Tendo knew what that meant: Evil. She scrutinized  Kasumi's smiling visage for another moment while contemplating the  possibilities. It could be a trap. But the coffee… Coffee wasn't  evil! Or was it? It was possibly the most perfect substance ever  created, besides money, and the only reason <i>that</i> won out was  because she could use it to buy more coffee. But it was also early.  Early was bad, which made this… 'Early morning Coffee,' made by  one of those wretched "early birds" no less. Zombie Nabiki  considered the thoroughly twisted logic a moment longer before  succumbing to the seductive aroma under her nose.</p><p><i>SLUUUuuuuURRRRP…</i></p><p>Hot black liquid flowed  from the warm mug and into the Tendo's mouth, proceeding down her  throat and into her stomach where it was promptly metabolized into  something more useful, much like a vampire would find blood useful;  that is to say, life giving. Fortunately for Nabiki, the mug in her  hands required neither supernatural guile to seduce nor fangs to  dispatch. In other words, the beverage's chances of surviving its  encounter with Zombie Nabiki were less than a plate of food surviving  its chance encounter with the giant panda currently residing in their  home.</p><p>For those of you just  joining us, that would be zero point zero percent, with a zero  percent margin of error.</p><p>This ritualistic  sacrifice was repeated seven times before something akin to life was  reignited within the Tendo's eyes, banishing the dead, bloodshot  orbs in favor something resembling intelligence, but no less  bloodshot. With her brain operating somewhere above room temperature  now, Nabiki turned to the foremost matter on her mind:  why exactly was she up so damn early again?</p><p>"You're getting  lazy, boy!"</p><p>"Back off, ya old  Panda!"</p><p><i>Ah yes, </i>Nabiki  mused darkly, now that that particular portion of her brain were  capable of such musings. <i>That's why I'm up</i>. The girl  briefly entertained the thought of an eighth mug, but decided against  it. As the inviting black liquid was, it was a double edged sword; a  balancing act, Nabiki rationalized as she sat up from the table and  moseyed to the open sliding door that looked out upon the dojo  courtyard. Drink too little and she'd be lucky to survive the day,  let alone stay awake. Drink too much and she ran the risk of burn  out, and a burned out Nabiki was almost as bad as a Zombie Nabiki,  save the fact that she retained just enough awareness to make  decisions. <i>Bad</i> decisions if the past was any indicator. Bad  decisions cost her money, which explained her need to closely monitor  her caffeine intake. Especially today, as she couldn't afford what  a bad decision might cost her.</p><p>The first rays of dawn  were only just now cracking the deep indigo horizon, slowly banishing  the shadows of dusk and night as two blurs danced between them.  Nabiki's eyes tracked the figures, one black haired teen and  another balding, round elder. Perhaps 'dance' wasn't so apt a  descriptive after all, and she mentally redressed her assessment of  the pair. It might apply to Ranma alone and performing a kata by  himself… or <i>herself</i>, she corrected, given the new dynamic  she learned of last night. What she saw in front of her now was  hardly a dance. 'Indiscriminate grappling' was probably a better  term, she decided as the pair charged into one another, cut loose  with several martial arts combinations and disengaged. Wash, rinse,  repeat.</p><p>All in all, it was a  fairly boring scene for the Tendo and she was half tempted to seduce  another cup of coffee when the inevitable happened. In retrospect,  she wasn't sure if he let his guard slip on purpose or if his  father just got a lucky shot in, but Nabiki now watched intently as  Ranma executed a summersault into his old man, only to have it  countered and swept aside. Genma's arm deflected the inbound foot  wide and responded in kind, pushing his own leg into Ranma's torso  at high speed. Given the power, vector, and speed involved, there  could only be one landing zone.</p><p><i>SPAALOooooOOSH!</i></p><p>The redhead was up out  of the pond instantly without the traditional "whaddya do that for"  and it was in that moment that Nabiki decide that Ranma had let her  guard down on purpose. Even in her sleepy state, that single fact  rippled across her awareness, chaining together with last night's  revelations. Ranma Saotome, man among men, didn't mind being a  girl. Not only did he not mind being a girl, <i>she</i> had taken to  it quite well. Well enough to befriend Kuno and allow him to court  her. Akane was also complicit in the entire sordid affair. All three  parties were open and honest about the situation with her now. They  also knew that she would most likely use said information as a high  source of revenue in the very near future, and now… Ranma had let  his father get in a shot; a shot he <i>knew</i> would send him into  the koi pond.</p><p><i>Before school.</i></p><p>A slight chill seeped  through Nabiki Tendo's soul as father and daughter re-engaged, the  pigtailed girl now pressing her father hard with a new found speed  and nimbleness. <i>Today's the day</i>, a small voice whispered  from the back of her head, instantly burning away any remaining  fatigue more effectively than a quadruple shot mocha-latte could ever  have hoped to accomplish. The middle Tendo rolled the thought around  in her head with a new found clarity as Ranma continued to unleash  brutal combinations into her father, who was still unsuccessfully  trying to goad her with insults. <i>You wouldn't…</i> Nabiki  whispered to herself and began to formulate a plan. The timing was  going to be tricky. Only an hour and a half until school with no  advanced preparation or ground work. Contacts would have to be  informed. She just knew those three were going to play merry hell  with the odds today.</p><p>Nabiki's urge to  reach for the nearby phone was interrupted by Genma Saotome and the  peppering insults he was directing at his son-turned-daughter. Sure,  he was getting the pants beat off of him, but that didn't stop him  from using them as a distraction technique. It was one in particular,  however, that stopped Nabiki's hands from ever reaching the wall  mounted telephone.</p><p>"That was pathetic,  Ranma!" The balding martial artist taunted, barely intercepting the  redhead's fist in time while expertly masking the pain it produced  in his forearm. "Maybe that body suits you after all!"</p><p>"Maybe it does."</p><p>Genma's eyes widened  with the response and that was all it took for Ranma to shift gears,  opening Genma's guard like a buzz saw on crack. One moment, Genma  was tracking his son through the attacks; the next, she was a red  blur. Everything after that was a blur, in fact, as the follow on  strike slammed into his body, blowing him across the dojo and into  the koi pond. What was once an Anything Goes master was now a giant  soaked panda, sitting in its shallow depth.</p><p>"Cheater!" the  oversized Panda waved the wooden sign with an irritated expression  evident across its features, assuming one was proficient in  interpreting the moods of giant marital arts panda. Regardless, it  declined the invitation to rejoin the fray and instead produced  another sign. "What do you have to say for yourself, worthless  girl?"</p><p>Ranma favored the  soaking Panda with a benevolent look and smiled. The smile chilled  both father and middle Tendo alike.</p><p>"Be careful what you  wish for, old man."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"That was on purpose,  wasn't it?"<p>Ranma looked up from  her dresser to find Nabiki standing in the doorway of her guestroom.  She finished buttoning the final clasp on her red silk shirt and sent  the Tendo a put out look. "Jeez, Nabs. Ever hear of knocking?"</p><p>Nabiki Tendo had, of  course, heard of knocking, but she charged premium rates for that  particular privilege and would have happily quoted them if the  question were not largely rhetorical in nature. After a moment under  the Tendo's gaze, Ranma shrugged. "Yeah, you caught me."</p><p>Nabiki stepped in,  taking her admission as a silent welcome. Whether it was or not was  an entirely different story, not to mention something largely  irrelevant to the Ice Queen anyway. "Why?"</p><p>"Think you know the  answer to that already." She watched as Ranma walked over to the  nearby closet and stoop on her tiptoes, fishing around the upper most  shelf for something. A moment later she was back to her normal  height, having successfully retrieved a small, plain white box. Even  if Ranma's standard red and black silks hadn't confirmed her  hypothesis, the terse reply all but did.</p><p>"You're coming out  today." It was simultaneously a question and a statement, to which  the martial artist simply smiled. "At school." Nabiki continued,  not necessarily believing the conclusion she had come to herself. But  here was Ranma, books on her bed and getting ready for school, as a  girl. Seeing no objection to the contrary, the mercenary shook her  head in awe. "Oh my dear Lord. You're serious."</p><p>"Don't see why  not." Ranma, admitted, fingering the small box in her hand. "After  all, you're gonna sell the information anyway, right?"</p><p>Nabiki blinked. The  word 'duh' came to mind, but she managed to refrain from speaking  it aloud "Well, of course."</p><p>"Right." The  redhead confirmed the obvious nature of the fact and continued. "So  Tachi and I talked it over last night and decided now was as good a  time as any."</p><p>"Okay." Nabiki  nodded, accepting the fact. "But why?"</p><p>"Damage control,  mostly." Ranma thumbed the top off the small white box, setting its  top gently on the dresser before pulling a thick, glistening strand  from the container. Nabiki watched it sparkle in the morning light  that flooded through the rooms open window and instantly knew it was  gold. White gold. Expensive white gold. "Tatewaki brought up a good  point after ya left… If we just let you do business and stand by  passive and all, things are going to get worse faster than they get  better. Probably just spiral out of control like everything else."</p><p>"And…?" Nabiki's  eyes were now picking out tiny sparkles of light grafted between the  interwoven strands of gold Ranma was now applying to her neck.  Diamonds. The Tendo twitched unconsciously. RanmaSaotome…  with a choker.</p><p><i>And she's going to  wear it to school. </i></p><p>Ranma looked away from  the dresser mirror and noted Nabiki's silent boggling with an  impish grin. "Like it? Tachi got it for me a few months back."  Nabiki Tendo produced the barest of nods and she continued, "Anyway,  we figure if we get a jump on the shit storm that's waitin' for  us, we can at least spin it while you do your thing." The impish  smile faded slightly. "But a shit storm's still a shit storm."</p><p>Nabiki simply shook her  head, but agreed. "And going down there with that thing on isn't  going to make your life any easier. Hell, once the school body sees  that…" her voiced trailed off and Ranma simply shrugged.</p><p>"Tired of hidin'  it." The girl stated, hefting her book bag across her back and lead  Nabiki out into the hall. "'Cides, you know me."</p><p>"No, I <i>thought</i>  I knew you." She corrected, earning a chuckle from her redheaded  counterpart. "But yes, I know. Suicidal death wishes are just about  on par for the martial artists of Nerima."</p><p>The pair trotted down  stairs and Nabiki was only mildly surprised to find Akane waiting for  them with a pleasant smile<i>. Goddamn partners in crime</i>, she  mused darkly. The smile widened as the glistening white gold and  diamonds came into view. Ranma cleared the final step as Akane leaned  in for a closer look, fingering the woven gold as her friend angled  her chin up to provide a better view.</p><p>"OOoooh, you weren't  kidding when you said you had a surprise." The youngest Tendo  stared in wide eyed amazement. The smile remained as she pulled back.  "Now I can see why you were keeping it a secret!"</p><p>Nabiki schooled her  features into a neutral expression, as she was long past asking just  how long Akane had known about Ranma and Kuno's relationship, let  alone little details like insanely expensive diamond studded chokers.  Besides, the answer was liable to make her head explode anyway. She  couldn't afford that, today of all days. Even Akane and her  cheerfulness was damn near a freak of nature.</p><p>Akane gave the necklace  on last admiring glance before stepping over to the door. "Ready?"</p><p>Ranma opened her mouth,  but paused. "Just a sec, be right back." She stepped deeper into  the house, finding Soun and Genma chatting pleasantly over tea while  Kasumi tidied up around them. The eldest Tendo looked up from her  cleaning and smiled. The smile quickly turned to befuddlement when  she picked out the redheads crucial change in wardrobe. Smiling  herself, Ranma discreetly motioned with her head to come over while  the old men continued their chatter.</p><p>"Um, Ranma… Is that  a…?" Kasumi leaned in, hesitantly poking at the necklace around  her neck.</p><p>Ranma simply nodded.  "Don't worry. Fill ya in later, Kas-chan." She looked over  Kasumi's shoulder to find the Tendo and Saotome patriarchs staring  at them. "Just want to let you know the house could be seein'  some action later on today."</p><p>"Action, Ranma-kun?"</p><p>"'chan', Kasumi."  Ranma correct, causing the daughter to blink rapidly. "And by  action, I mean fiancées, fathers, mothers, old perverts… The  whole nine yards."</p><p>"Oh my." Kasumi put  a hand to her lips, clearly receiving the implied meaning behind the  redhead's words. "Does this have to do with what's been  happening between you and Akane lately?"</p><p>"Everything, Kas."  Ranma admitted, causing Kasumi's expression to waiver uncertainly.  Seeing this, she continued, "But don't worry. Everything's  gonna be alright." The eldest simply nodded with Ranma's  assertion until she spoke the next words. "Just messy. Very, very  messy."</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>The martial artist  simply smiled at her father and gave the trio a nod. "Off to  school. Ja-ne!"</p><p>With that, Ranma was  gone, leaving a still confused Kasumi and two curious parents in her  wake.</p><p>"Um Kasumi…?" She  broke out of her dazed state to find Genma stepping to her side.  "What was that around my boy's neck?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Three girls now made  their way down the streets of Nerima at a leisurely pace as they  walked to that last bastion of educational hope known as Furikan High  School. As far as schools go, and contrary to popular belief, it was  actually one of the better ones… As long as one could overlook the  insane principle, ki vampires, and of course, the martial arts mayhem  that ensued on a regular basis. To some, this was unacceptably  abusive to the students in attendance. To others, it was a dumping  ground for the problem children who didn't fit in elsewhere.<p>In reality, it was  motivation.</p><p>Bad haircuts?  Extortion? Blackmail? Martial arts challenges? High energy Ki blasts?  Insane kendoist? 'Prepare to die, Ranma?' Simply put, nobody  wanted to be held back a year to repeat their classes in academic  purgatory, which meant that Furikan High's graduation rates and  grad point averages were some of the best in Japan. The unfortunate  side effect of this chaotic pressure cooker was that Furikan also  tended to imbue its graduates with extreme behavioral aberrations,  producing more mad scientists, evil magic practitioners, and  megalomaniacal CEOs than the average high school.</p><p>Oh, and super powered  martial artists; can't forget those.</p><p>"What was that all  about with my sister?"</p><p>The question just  happened to be directed at a martial artist of the super powered  variety, who in turn looked down from the fence top she had been  transferring. Since two of the three Tendo sisters were present at  her side, the third pertaining to Nabiki's question could easily be  deduced.</p><p>"Just givin' her  fair warning." Ranma commented easily, hopping down to their level  with a flip. "She deserves that much. Probably more."</p><p>"Definitely more."  Akane agreed in all seriousness, leaving Nabiki to feel her way  through uncharted territory once more. The middle Tendo had suspected  that her little sister was confiding in Kasumi for some time now, but  exactly how pivotal of a role she played in this surreal drama was as  yet unknown. That was okay. School was still a good ten minutes away.  Even though it wasn't enough time to subtly draw the information  out of the two, she sensed there really wasn't any need to tiptoe  around the topic and instead went for the direct approach.</p><p>"Does she know too?"</p><p>"Uh-uh." Akane  shook her head. "Pouring my soul out to her several times a week  was burden enough, let alone what she already carries…"</p><p>"…<i>and</i>  involve her in this mess?" Ranma's eyes widened, clearly aghast  at the idea while agreeing with Akane. "Not a chance."</p><p>"Heck, she doesn't  even know me and Dai…" Akane's mouth simply stopped working  from Nabiki's point of view, then snapped shut. The middle Tendo  looked from her sister to Ranma, who was now chewing on her upper  lip.</p><p>"Dai-what, little  sister?" Nabiki's eyes narrowed, and Akane's face melted into  clueless ness. The sister's focus sharpened further as a little  piece of last night's dojo conversation snapped into place. "Or  rather, Dai-<i>who</i>?"</p><p>Ranma came to her  rescue before the interrogation began in earnest. "One crisis at a  time, Nabs." Then to her surprise, the Saotome reached back to her  pigtail and untied the Dragon Whisker binding it. Free of restraint,  waves of shoulder length red hair cascaded brilliantly in the morning  sunlight. "'Cides, I already called dibs on this one."</p><p>Nabiki missed Akane's  chuckle entirely as she simply stared at the girl transforming before  her very eyes. It had been in discrete steps, she realized, starting  with the morning's sparing session. There, she had seen Ranko, the  parody of a tomboy mistakenly given a girl's body. Part and parcel  with that image came Ranma's usual Chinese silks. Then she wore the  choker, sending ripples across that tomboy image. Now her hair was  free and flowing in the slight breeze, distorting that tomboy image  further. At this rate, Nabiki wouldn't be surprised if it shattered  by days end, which only left one more question…</p><p>"Exactly how much is  that thing around your neck worth, anyway?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>D</b>eep breaths.<p>The redheaded martial  artist held her stance, focusing on nothing but the wooden practice  post standing before her. It was wood. Really just wood. It was not,  in fact, the visage of her fat-ass father whom Ranma just found had  sold her out <i>again</i>… To a wandering martial artist who <i>just  happened</i> to be traveling though the Quing Hai providence of China  nearly two years ago in search for his long lost son.</p><p>Ranma Saotome's  muscles cramped as she fought to maintain the kendo form. Rage sang  through her brain as the target dummies' head took on the face she  knew all too well.</p><p>Selling her out was  nothing new, Ranma amended as she fought down the urge to lash out  indiscriminately at the dummy via the art she had been trained in  since she could walk. Even the negotiable instrument of sale wasn't  all that surprising to the Saotome, who had not even flinched when  informed that his- now her -hand in marriage had been bought for a  kettle of hot water. No, what was surprising was <i>whom</i> 'he'  had been sold to; that is if the word 'surprising' could be used  to express insult, rage, shock and horror simultaneously. Apparently,  the deal was such that once the wandering martial artist found his  son, he and his daughter would find Genma and seal the arranged  marriage.</p><p>Needless to say, the  father finally found his son yesterday.</p><p>His newest fiancee's  name was Yoiko.</p><p>The family name was  Hibiki.</p><p>Ranma trembled and  fought to channel her violent urges into controlled focus, stepping  forward in two exact steps and unleashed upon the straw dummy. The  blurring lines represented three precise strikes, cutting through her  target's head, torso and the wooden post that would have been its  legs. Compared to Anything Goes, the results were rather  unspectacular. Two steps and a flash of movement was all that  represented her attack and the dummy stood fast before the stoic  girl.</p><p>But only for a moment.</p><p>The practice blade in  her hand was wood. The target was straw bound to a wooden post. Under  normal circumstances, the wood on wood interaction would have  rebounded off one another with a force more than sufficient to  indicate a successful strike to the wielder. Normal, however, did not  adequately describe the damage Ranma Saotome was able to inflict upon  the target with her bokken and the wooden dummy promptly parted into  three discrete segments, clattering to the floor. She held the  striking stance for another few moments, allowing her resentment to  bleed away into something more manageable before relaxing to consider  her handiwork.</p><p><i>God forbid, maybe  Tatewaki was right</i>, Ranma mused, wallowing in the irony. If there  was one thing she was when it came to the art, it was a  perfectionist. It was easy to be an angry perfectionist with Anything  Goes. In fact, the art almost encouraged the unrestrained violence  and improvisation it begat, which had been the upper classman's  point all along; Chaos bred chaos, causing her art to overflow into  her actions and life. <i>Irony, hell</i>, she snorted. It was  <i>sickeningly</i> ironic that her chief rival was now slated to be  her brother in-law, let alone the fact that her mother was fully  backing the initiative.</p><p>About the only good to  come from that particular incident was the look on Ryoga's face.</p><p>It was <i>priceless.</i></p><p>Regardless, the  controlled release of her anger over the last few weeks was somewhat  calming as she let her life's frustrations ablate off the  discipline the kendoist art required. It was, in its own way, a soul  of ice technique. Unlike Cologne's soul of ice, however, the focus  wasn't upon maintaining a cold emotionless state. The focus was to  channel that emotion into controlled bursts, and Ranma's  perfectionist nature served her well in this new art, pushing that  self control to its limits. It was a hard-won victory and even though  this newest crisis was pushing her patience to the limit, she simply  did not know how to quit. It was perhaps the one favorable aspect of  training under her father- The word 'fail' had literally been  beat out of her.</p><p>The  pigtailed girl briefly considering slaying another target dummy off  to her right, but shook her head. There was no need. The effort that  was required to maintain the form through her emotional tempest had  thoroughly drained the Saotome, and she opted to instead walk over to  the weapons rack and replace the wooden blade with its cousins. This  particular bokken would need replaced soon, as she had abused it  fairly well in the early days of her stress management. Ranma gave  the marred and pitted stick a fond smile before grabbing a towel that  also hung off the same rack, wiping away the moisture on her forehead  that was born more of stress than physical exertion.</p><p>She  was about to set the towel back in place when she paused, awareness  rippling through her being. She glanced over her shoulder to find a  cat faced ninja kneeling in the doorway of the gym.</p><p>"What's up,  Sasuke?"</p><p>The direct address  prompted the diminutive Ninja to look upon the redhead directly as  opposed to averting his eyes to the floor. "If the Mistress is  finished with her exercises, I have had servants prepare a washroom  so that you may freshen up."</p><p>Ranma face took on a  look of annoyance as she stepped away from the rack. "You know damn  well I ain't no Mistress, Sasuke. I'm a guy, Kuno and I ain't  datin' and we sure as hell ain't doing <i>that</i>, so come off  it already."</p><p>"Regardless," The  ninja countered, never leaving his subservient crouch. "Master Kuno  favors your company and I shall accede to his wishes… until such  time your condition becomes more… <i>obvious</i> to the Master."</p><p>Ranma simply rolled her  eyes. "Don't hold your breath. One of these days yer gonna have  to tell me just what kinda hold somebody like Kuno has on you."</p><p>"Perhaps." The  ninja returned noncommittally before steering away from the topic.  "The servants know of your… <i>distain </i>of warm water and have  prepared the guest washroom accordingly."</p><p>"Gee, <i>thanks</i>."</p><p>"I shall pass along  your approval." Ranma could have sworn she saw the barest of smiles  on the Ninja's face and adopted a bland look as he continued. "When  you are ready, Master Kuno desires your company in the main lounge."</p><p>'<i>Desires</i>'.  Ranma shivered with the word, even though she knew the meaning behind  it was fairly innocuous. 'Master' Kuno had been tiptoeing on  eggshells around her since she laid down the law weeks ago and  likewise, she was becoming use to his flowery mode of speech. She dug  her toes into the blue practice mat that lined the room's floor.  'Desires', as in a requesting her presence. Nothing more. Right.  The ninja nodded and was gone as silently as he came, leaving Ranma  to wonder just how skilled he actually was. Half the time she could  sense the mousey retainer and the other half… She shrugged to  herself. In either case, the clumsy servant was hardly a threat.</p><p>Guestroom three was a  familiar sight to Ranma by now and her feet silently rejoiced as they  sank into the deep shag of the neutral beige carpeting. It was the  closest suite to the gym she normally used, and as much as she hated  to admit it, she was actually starting to like the opulent luxury the  room exuded. Every piece of furniture was solid wood. While it  wasn't something she was an expert on, it was a rich dark brown and  screamed expensive whether she was looking at the dressers or the  'simple' intricately carved end tables. Even the bed simply  screamed wealth, from its wide cushioning surface to the near ceiling  height headboard; also made of the same rich wood. The thick spreads  called to her and Ranma had no choice but to acknowledge just how  wonderful they would be to crawl under even if she had absolutely no  intention of doing so. <i>That</i> would cross a line. She was here  to simply clean up and leave a measure of chaos at the door, not  sleep in one of Kuno's wonderfully comfortable beds under soft  lighting.</p><p>It had been a <i>long</i>  day.</p><p>The Saotome stared at  the bed longingly for another moment before sighing and heading to  the back of the room and the waiting washroom. Like the suite to her  back, the washroom was simply enormous by any standards she had to  measure. It was literally the size of the Tendo living room <i>and</i>  kitchen, well lit and stocked with every amenity one could hope to  use while soaking, primping, dressing… whatever. Soaking was  another no-no however, though another thing she could really use at  the moment. While a cold water wash down was the last thing her sore  muscles needed now, the <i>very</i> last thing she needed was for  Tatewaki, Kodachi or the household servants to find a male Ranma  Saotome on the premises.</p><p>The redhead simply  shrugged off her Chinese silks and kicked them into the corner before  moving through to the inner washroom and the elaborately decorated  wash basin that waited. The copper eagle head water spout before her  was the epitome of wealth and bad taste. She took another look at the  steaming furo only a few feet away and frowned. Elaborately decorated  or not, a cold wash hardly compared to a nice long soak. The act  itself was over and done with clinical efficiency. Few people wanted  to spend their time under buckets of cold water and Ranma Saotome was  no exception to that rule. Rinsing, soaping up and rinsing again  before returning to the main bathroom wet and cold for her trouble.  She stepped back out onto black marble with a towel and paused,  eyebrow arched. Hanging from a nearby hook was a new red Chinese  shirt and matching black tangs. She padded over to the fresh clothing  and looked back into the corner where she had recently discarded her  clothing.</p><p>They were gone.</p><p>"You've <i>got</i>  to be kidding." She mumbled to herself, fingering red silk. They  were like new. In fact, they <i>were</i> new. Brand spankin' new.  And almost exactly like her silks of old as well. There was one minor  difference, however, and she ground her teeth down when she noticed  it. Her boxers were missing. Replaced, actually, by a bra and  panties. "Somebody's in line for a serious ass kickin'" Ranma  growled, balling her fists tightly for a moment, then let the anger  seep away. She was getting better at that really. It was even harder  to fault the person more than likely responsible for the  transgression.</p><p>As if bidden by her  very thoughts, the restroom door clicked open to admit woman clad in  a classic black and white maid outfit complete with frills and white  stocking. She was somewhere in her late twenties by the Saotome's  estimate, with shining, black locks curling around her pale face and  framing green eyes. The woman made no apologies for the intrusion,  nor did she even bat an eye over the fact that she had just walked in  on one completely nude Ranma Saotome. Instead, the redhead received a  generous bow and kindly smile. "I pray that the replacements are  satisfactory, Lady Saotome. Your previous wear was in quite a  deteriorated state."</p><p>Try as she might, the  nude girl simply couldn't work up the anger to necessary to rebuke  her and instead opted to nod dumbly. The woman was like Kasumi,  though in some ways worse when it came to her irresistible nature.  But then, new clothing that looked exactly like her old stuff wasn't  the end of the world. "Uh, yeah, Yoko. Looks okay to me, I guess."</p><p>"Excellent." She  clasped her hands together. Even her eyes were smiling now. "The  local vendors were inadequate for the task, so I was forced to import  your style."</p><p>"Eh… Import…?"  Ranma blinked, only vaguely aware that she was standing nude before  her very own personal servant. Early on, the woman's total and  willful obliviousness to her state of undress had caught the martial  artist off guard, prompting her to scramble for cover any time the  maid entered at an inconvenient time. In the end, it just happened so  often that covering up just became more trouble than it was worth and  Yoko's pleasant detachment went a long way to putting Ranma at  ease… or at least somewhere in the vicinity of grudging acceptance.  Besides, they were both girls and this was supposedly her job. Still,  something about importing her clothes was vaguely disturbing. Such as  importing them from where, exactly?</p><p>"From China."</p><p>Ranma very nearly  chocked on her own tongue right there. "China?"</p><p>"Of course." Yoko  nodded in all seriousness. "I shan't have the Lady wearing cheap  imitations."</p><p>"Eh… Right."  There really was no use protesting. The last two weeks had taught her  just how tenacious the woman could be when it came to discharging  what she perceived as her duties. The discussion just to convince  Yoko that she wasn't <i>required</i> to dress her had been tedious  enough. Instead, Ranma turned to the next topic of consternation,  fingering the handing bras and panties. "And <i>these?</i>"</p><p>Yoko's pleasant smile  slipped ever so slightly. "Are far more comfortable than your  previous… <i>undergarments</i>. They are Chantelle, after all."</p><p>"Chantelle. Right."  Ranma repeated without a clue as to what Chantelle was beyond being a  thorn in her side. Under normal circumstances she would have just  vaporized the creamy garments and their hints of lace with a low  power ki burst and claim they were very comfortable regardless, but  her keeper was here and she knew what was coming next.</p><p>"Let me help you into  those."</p><p>"Really I can do it  myse—" Ranma's protest went little further than the first few  words before being cut off by a stern look from the maids green eyes.</p><p>"Nonsense. This is my  duty and I shan't be found neglectful." Yoko slipped the bra off  the hanger and brought it to bear.</p><p>The pigtailed girl was  barely suppressing the twitches that came with the implied threat.  "No, really. I can—"</p><p>The panties came off  their hook next. "And I shouldn't want Master Kuno to hear that  you haven't been properly serviced."</p><p>"C'mon, I won't  tell if you w—Hey!"</p><p>The woman was around  her with a speed her slight frame belied and before she knew it,  Ranma's arms were being guided through the cream shoulder straps  and her breast captured within soft cups. Two clasps later and the  deed was done before the martial artist's normal defensive measures  could even begin to come online, leaving her blinking as her bosom  adjusted to its new position. Yoko held the panties out with her  pleasant, unyielding smile.</p><p>"Next?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Seriously, 'Tate,  ya need to talk to Yoko."<p>Tatewaki Kuno's hand  stopped mid-stroke, denying the canvas bound stork a major flight  feather. He set the brush back onto the colorfully smeared pallet  with a soft click and turned his full attention to the girl entering  to his back. Her words prompted a frown and he cocked his head  curiously. "Indeed, what is this problem with my esteemed Servant,  fiery Goddess?"</p><p>Ranma strode into the  study in a huff, barely noting either the soft music that played in  the background or overly indulgent form of address. Her left hand  tugged at the opposite sleeve to illustrate the problem clearly. "She  tossed out my stuff and bought me new clothes!"</p><p>"Surely not!" His  eyes widened. "They were not of the highest quality then?"</p><p>The question caught the  pigtailed girl off guard. "Well, yeah they are, but that's not  the point! She bought me panties and a bra, too!"</p><p>"Are they not  comfortable? Your sizes?" Tatewaki pressed, determined to find the  source of the girl's angst. "While it is true that I hath  provided Yoko with a generous expense account intended toward your  well being, I doth expect it be spent responsibly."</p><p>"Well yeah they fit,  but…!" Ranma's argument abruptly faltered as it became clear  exactly where the conversation was going. "That's not what I  mean!"</p><p>"Excellent."  Tatewaki nodded with satisfaction, ignoring the redhead's  consternation. "Yoko-chan is quite reliable in that regard."</p><p>"But she keeps  insistin' on dressing me!" There was the slightest hint of  pleading in martial artist's voice now, like that of a person  fighting a lost cause and knowing it.</p><p>"It is heartening to  hear thus." Kuno nodded, removing himself entirely from the cushion  he sat upon. "Perhaps I should include a bonus in her next paycheck  along with your praise."</p><p>Ranma Saotome simply  rand a slight hand through her red mane and grabbed a tuft in  exasperation. "Yeah, sure. Why the hell not. Give her a raise while  you're at it."</p><p>"An excellent  suggestion."</p><p>Ranma simply groaned,  realizing she really ought to know better by now. The Kuno mansion  was, after all, a sanity free zone. Of course, there were worse  things in life than being pestered by your own personal servant  looking to cater to your every whim, she amended, and most of them  were outside beyond the mansion gates. Parents, fiancées and  the possibility of Ryoga becoming her brother in-law were certainly  among them.</p><p>"And I see that thou  have ended your exercises early." The upper classman segued easily,  breaking her self loathing train of thought. "Hath thy tensions  diminished to more endurable levels?"</p><p>"Ha! As if!" The  redhead laughed bitterly, taking a seat within Kuno's study. It was  a large, plush burgundy velvet chair and it had rapidly become one of  her favorites when it came to chatting with the kendoist. After all,  she might as well get comfy if she was going to endure his rambling.  "Found out that Ryoga's slated to be my brother in law. That's  not even takin' into account what they got planned for his sister."</p><p>"Ryoga…" Tatewaki  scratched his chin thoughtfully, trying to recall the name. "You  mean the barbaric swine-boy, do you not?"</p><p>"Heh, that's him  alright. good ol' P-cha…" The syllables dropped off and Ranma's  eyes widened ever so slightly while a look of incredulity seeped  across her face. "Waitaminute… You <i>know</i> about Ryoga's…  problem?"</p><p>"Only a fool could  miss such an affliction, and I assure you Tatewaki Kuno is surely no  fool!"</p><p>"No. Of course not."  The stunned Ranma nodded agreeably. Just how long had the stick  swinger known? The Saotome's thought process was running well into  the redline with the revelation when another unpleasant thought  occurred to him. "Uh, see any other, um, cursed people runnin'  around I should know about?"</p><p>"The peasant Chinese  of the Cat Café are among the afflicted as well, to my  knowledge." Kuno reported, all but leading Ranma by the hand down  her path into the twilight zone. "Sasuke keeps detailed records of  their activities."</p><p>"Eh…" Ranma was  forced to moisten her lips as they seemed to have dried suddenly.  Detailed records… He knew about all the other players, which could  mean… "And what about Ranma Saotome?"</p><p>"A fowl sorcerer,  without a doubt!" the upperclassman's ire rose immediately with  the question. "I shall smite him for the injustices laid upon your  sweet bosom! The Gods must assuredly weep for such a—!"</p><p>"I <i>AM</i> RANMA,  YOU TWIT!" The redhead exploded as Kuno wore down the last measure  of her patience. "I'm a guy! One hundred percent guy!" She  grabbed at the hot tea steaming on a nearby end table.</p><p><i>Splash!</i></p><p>"The foul sorcerer!"  Kuno's eyes widened as Ranma transformed to the object of his  hatred and she grabbed the pitcher of melting ice next to it, up turn  it and numerous cubes bounced off her head and onto the floor.  Residual water splashed and he became a she once more. "The pigtail  girl!"</p><p>Ranma stood before the  dazed boy. "Now do ya see…?"</p><p>"I… I see." Kuno  blinked, taking in the wet girl. Definitely stunned, she noted. Maybe  this time she had gotten through. Sure, it'd most likely deny her a  safe haven from the chaos that rained down upon her regularly, but it  was a win-win either way in her opinion. If he saw the curse for what  it was, that would be one less person trying to date her. If he  continued true to form, well, she still had her hideout. Maybe he  would—"I see that the foul sorcerer is attempting to gain purchase on your soul!"</p><p><i>Then again, maybe  not.</i> The martial artist fell back into her plush seat in defeat  as another stab at reason ablated of Tatewaki's delusional armor.  "Dammit, 'Tate…"</p><p>"Indeed, he attempts  to dissuade my aid by projecting his ghastly visage through your  purity!" Kuno was flailing wildly now, pulling the ever present  bokken away from the nearby canvas he had been tending. He raised it  before Ranma herself with no small amount of flourish. "Fear not,  vivacious pigtailed goddess, for he will not succeed. My dispensation  of aid shallt continue regardless of his meddling!"</p><p>"Riiiight." Ranma  shook her head and shrugged. True, he still wasn't getting it, but  the very fact that he could actually perceive the change was a small  victory nonetheless. And if she played her cards right… "So does  that mean you don't mind seeing him around now?"</p><p>"Truly, the sight  makes me wretch, but I will resist the effort to smite such an  illusion on sight," He calmed, studying the pigtailed girl. "I  would ask, however, that you resist the sorcerer with all of your  might, my goddess."</p><p>Ranma arched an  eyebrow. As if. "And why would I want to do that?"</p><p>"As you may know, my  twisted sibling is quite enamored with the dark magician." Tatewaki  elaborated solemnly. "It would not do for her to think that this  chimera he projects upon your person is actually he himself. I fear  the results would be quite… <i>unwholesome</i>." Ranma blinked.  'Unwholesome' was certainly one way to describe Kodachi's  desires for her, not to mention a <i>very </i>compelling argument to  'resist the foul sorcerer'. Kuno noticed the girl pale and  nodded. "I see you understand."</p><p>Ranma also nodded,  pushing back into her seat in an unconscious bid for emotional  security. There was no doubt in her mind that if it came down to it,  anything involving Kodachi would also most likely include thorns,  drugs, ribbons and various other… <i>aids.</i> Tatewaki Kuno  watched the unconscious shiver and smiled gently, returning the  wooden sword to its resting place near the canvas stand. "Fear not  beautiful pigtail girl, for I shall protect both you and the tigress  Tendo from the malicious designs of my sister and Saotome."</p><p>The comment seemed to  shake Ranma from her uneasiness, allowing her to project a glare at  the kendoist. "Ya really gotta stop that."</p><p>"Stop what?"</p><p><i>Clueless</i>, she  snorted mentally and elaborated. "Ya really gotta stop the whole me  or Akane thing."</p><p>"I do not underst—"</p><p>"Alright, let me  spell it out for ya." Ranma continued, leaning onto the edge of her  seat. "Chicks don't like the indecision crap. Take it from me, it  causes more trouble than its worth. Ya can't just go around  claimin' ya love two at the same time."</p><p>The look on Kuno's  face was that of one trying to comprehend rocket science. "It is  thus? But how?"</p><p>"Chicks get jealous  and when chicks get jealous, they fight." The redhead explained,  encouraged by the fact that her audience of one was so receptive to  the concept. "Not only that, but they tend ta make your life a  living hell in the process so do yourself a favor and stop it."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>"But nothin'"  Ranma cut him off, denying him the chance to insert his own illogic  into the conversation. If she could just get him to see it from her  angle… "Ya just don't go around yellin' that you love two  chicks. Take my word for it. I'm an authority on this one. It'll  get you beat, drugged, hated, misunderstood if not all of the above."</p><p>The upperclassman  dropped quietly to his stool, and began to rub his chin, deep in  thought. "And I have been behaving thus?"</p><p>"Well, duh." The  redhead deadpanned, mildly annoyed that it wasn't already obvious.  A slight shuffling from behind distracted her in that moment. Ranma  leaned around the enormous armrest to find a smartly dressed butler  entering the study with two towels, one a plain white, the other a  dark forest green draped across his arm and a dustpan in the other  hand. The older man stepped up beside Ranma with a kindly smile and  offered her the fuzzy green towel while retaining the plain one for  himself.</p><p>"Your towel, Lady  Saotome."</p><p>Ranma stared for a  moment before realizing that was her cue to take the towel to dry  herself off. Heck, she was wet so often due to the curse that she  barely noticed anymore herself, but the mansion staff <i>did</i>.  That would leave the remaining towel and pan to clean up the mess she  made for Kuno's failed lesson. "Eh, sorry 'bout that, Hosho."</p><p>"Think nothing of it,  Lady Saotome." He was already bending down to pad the carpeting  dry; he then proceeded to collect any errant ice cubes with the  dustpan. She put her own soft towel to use and wiped away the tea and  water from her skin, occasionally dabbing her hair and clothing to  remove the excess. The servant was done at nearly the same time and  he bowed, taking the green towel and disappearing back from whence he  came.</p><p>A fond look crept  across her face as the study door closed once more. Damned if towel  service wasn't handy. Nice old guy too. Didn't ogle at her or  anything when she had a soaked shirt either. She smiled slightly at  the thought, then turned back to Kuno. "But like I was sayin' it  ain't just the girls either. Polygamy went out with Edo, ya'know?"</p><p>"I believe I grasp  the portent of your words, my crimson beauty." Tatewaki returned,  clearly taking her words seriously by the look of concentration writ  across his face. "I shall endeavor to be more decisive in the  matter."</p><p>Ranma Saotome opened  her mouth to rebuke the upperclassman once more when she realized  that he had just agreed with her. <i>She was actually getting through  to him?</i> Recent experience had shown her the guy was smart, if  screwed up, but to actually have made progress in such a critical  area was quite surprising. Still, experience was a harsh mistress to  her and the martial artist sniffed doubtfully. "I'll believe that  when I see it." There was a slight pause and the way Tatewaki was  staring at her intently began to unnerve her. There were definitely  gears grinding in that brain now. "What?"</p><p>"Just… Nothing, my  fiery goddess." The mask of concentration flowed away and he smiled  with the change of subject. "We were talking of your day before  thee became sidetracked."</p><p>Ranma stared at him for  another moment. She wasn't sure what, but something had just  fundamentally changed. Still, Ranma knew she was better off quitting  while she was ahead, so she took the boy across up on his offer to  change the subject, dropping into friendly conversation mode as she  had become habit over the last couple of months. It really was  surprising what useful information and advice could be found within  his skewed take on life, almost enough to make conversing with the  guy a pleasant, stress free event. And if that failed, it made for  great comedy regardless. "Yeah, well, I'm worried about Aka—eh,  another person too. She, um, just broke up with, um, somebody and I'm  tryin' to help her out."</p><p>"Ah, the ails of a  broken heart." Kuno nodded sympathetically. "One must question  the wisdom of the poet writing on the ideal that it is better to  experience love lost then none at all. Truly such an event is tragic  in itself."</p><p>"Ain't it the  truth." Ranma leaned back and relaxed as she stepped back into the  familiar territory of friendly conversation. "And damned if I ain't  responsible for a good chunk of it too."</p><p>"A dilemma to be  sure." Tatewaki agreed. "So you have wronged this acquaintance,  then?"</p><p>"You could say that."  Ranma admitted. "Not on purpose, just… well, a bunch a things got  in the way. Can't just sit back and do nothin' again, but I'm  not sure how to handle it."</p><p>The kendoist simply  nodded noncommittally and took a sip of tea from a glass that Ranma  hadn't managed to spill earlier. He stared at the last remnants of  steam drifting up from the china cups' liquid contents for a moment  and then nodded once more, as if coming to a decision. "Then  perhaps reparations are to be made."</p><p>Ranma cocked her head  with the suggestion. "Reparations?"</p><p>"I know from our  relations that you hold honor dear to your busom, pigtailed goddess,"  Kuno elaborated. "For it is one of the reasons I find myself  irresistibly drawn to—"</p><p>"The point,  bokken-brains."</p><p>"Of course,"  Tatewaki acknowledge the rebuke as his cue to remain focused,  something thought to be a miracle to many outsiders that the girl  could even illicit such a response from the boy. "Like the samurai  of old you find yourself in a debt of honor, one that must be repaid.  Such amends will help heal this scar that looms across your  friendship."</p><p>Ranma simply stared. He  was right. The fact that he was right was less surprising than the  fact that she was continually finding valuable insight beneath the  layers of delusion and insanity. Oh, sure, one had to dig for it.  Excessively dig for it at times, but normally what she found was  quite insightful. It was also one of the reasons she even tolerated  his company—There was actually a person in there. Somewhere. <i>But  not just tolerate it</i>, she admitted somewhere in the back of her  mind. Amidst all the chaos and upheaval her life was experiencing  these days, Tatewaki Kuno was pleasant company. Diluted company to be  sure, but pleasant, and there were damn few people on that life's  list.</p><p>God forbid she was  actually considering the guy a friend.</p><p>Ranma shook the thought  away. She could deal with that later. MUCH later, and her mental  focus returned to Kuno. "So what kind of reparations do you—"</p><p>The door clicked open  to interrupt the conversation, admitting one Kodachi Kuno. She strode  elegantly past Ranma's chair and found a similar one opposite of  her person. After smoothing her long black skirt down, she sat,  producing an arrogant smile for her audience's benefit. "Ah, I  see you are finally through indulging in your brutish pastime."</p><p>Ranma scowled slightly.  "Poison any small kids lately, Ko-<i>chan</i>?"</p><p>The smile sweetened.  "Not purposely, of course." She paused as the familiar form of  Hosho stepped into the room with a china tea set on a silver platter.  The servant skillfully balanced the platter on one hand and served  Kodachi with the other, then proceeded to refresh Kuno and Ranma's  tea before bowing slightly and disappearing from sight. The Kuno  sibling took a sip and resumed her witty repartee. "So, will the  peasants of Furikan be participating in this year's Rhythmic  Gymnastics competition, <i>Ma-chan?"</i></p><p>Ranma's cheek ticked  slightly, but she managed to suppress her irritation for the most  part as the pair engaged in their ritual opening banter. "As if I  care. Not like Hebrick's could present much a challenge anyhow."</p><p>"And would you like  to place a friendly wager on that statement?" The gymnasts' gaze  narrowed and the smile became downright predatory and Ranma  recognized the attempt to bully her through financial superiority. It  was hardly the first such attempt, she noted absently and deflected  it as if it were another martial arts technique.</p><p>"Don't think so."  The redhead snorted. "Last thing I need is you cheatin' by  putting' half our team in the hospital, then have 'em all whining  to me to pick up the slack."</p><p>"Merely a product of  the inferior quality of your sports clubs." Kodachi chortled  ruthlessly.</p><p>"Hey, let's put  your old man in charge of <i>your </i>school and see how <i>they</i>  do." Ranma returned fire and even Tatewaki off to the side winced.  Kodachi's mouth opened to reply, but words failed her. That was  when Ranma noticed the hard glint gone from her eyes and knew in that  moment she had gone just a bit too far in their saber rattling. One  look over at Tatewaki's face revealed the same pain. "Uh, damn…  Look, sorry 'bout that Ko-chan."</p><p>The girls' eyes  gained a measure of edginess. "And just what do <i>you</i> have to  be sorry about?"</p><p>Ranma sighed, shoulders  slumped. While it was true that Kodachi wasn't anywhere close to  what she'd call a friend, the last thing she needed to do was go  around and stick her grubby fingers in other peoples old wounds, and  she knew from Tatewaki himself that the subject of their father was  an <i>old </i>wound<i>. Especially</i> when those wounds hit so  close to home. "I… Look, my old man is a bastard too. Guess it  ain't my place to be talkin' about yours."</p><p>"Hmmf." Kodachi  sniffed, as if the topic were one of mere annoyance. "And what  makes you think I care for either your contrived rambling or your  father?"</p><p>Ranma rolled her eyes  at the front Tatewaki's sister put up. "Look, just sayin' that  I know what you're goin' through. Not that I care or nothin'."</p><p>"I sincerely <i>doubt</i>  you do." Kodachi returned dryly. "And I suppose that I am now  expected to engage in some inane prattle concerning which one of us  has the worse father."</p><p>Ranma looked over the  girl clad in black for another moment and shrugged. "My old man  wrapped me head ta toe in fish sausage and tossed me in a pit of  starving cats."</p><p>"I <i>see</i>."  Kodachi glared and stood up. "Then I accept your challenge."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>R</b>anma Saotome couldn't  help but to smirk as Akane helped pick her sister off the ground for  the second time. While Nabiki Tendo wasn't a martial artist by any  stretch of the imagination, she normally wasn't prone to stumble  about and the redhead was taking a certain perverse satisfaction in  watching the middle sister practically fall over once more. But then  again, a little payback never hurt anybody, she amended. Even Akane  couldn't help but to smirk at the girl's dazed state upon finding  out that the necklace Ranma was currently wearing priced well into  six digits.<p>The Tendo regained her  footing and shot a look over at the redhead comprised of equal parts  irritation an awe. "You're enjoying this <i>way</i> too much."</p><p>"Mmmhmm." Ranma  nodded with a grin. "Did I mention how many diamonds it has?"</p><p>"Several times."  Nabiki glared.</p><p>"As if you care."  Akane resumed her place next to Ranma with amused countenance.</p><p>"True." Ranma  admitted. "It's the thought and all that, y'know?"</p><p>Akane nodded agreeably  while her sister dusted off her skirt irritably. Why did wealth  always seem to be wasted on the unappreciative? Nabiki considered the  question for a moment as she studied the redhead next to her and felt  a small measure of regret. For passing Ranma off to Akane? Not. Using  her for profit? Nah. Sandbagging their later engagement? Hardly. No,  that regret was squarely aimed the girl's newly acquired access to  Kuno's wealth. Nabiki's train of thought sidetracked across her  more devious nature as she briefly considered stepping in and  stealing the upperclassman for herself, thoughts that were quickly  shut down by the fact that not only she would have to cozy up to  Kuno- hardly an appealing prospect in itself –but deal with  Kodachi's potentially violent opposition. If that weren't enough-  and it was –Ranma herself had gone from known factor to wildcard.  There was no telling just how far a predominantly female Saotome  would go to protect her… <i>interests</i>. Ranma all by herself was  an easy mark. Ranma with something to lose was never <i>ever</i>  somebody to be taken lightly.</p><p>All in all, it was just  a bad idea, Nabiki quickly decided. It was in everyone's best  interest if she were an ally to this budding romance, not an  adversary. Besides, there was more than enough profit in that role  all by itself.</p><p>The trio rounded the  corner and the gates of Furinkan came into view, along with the  various other students looking to, or dreading the start of their  daily education. Among these were the regulars, the crowd that stood  by each and every morning just to watch what chaos the arrival of  Ranma and Akane would instigate. At the top of that list was normally  the beat-down of one upperclassman, of which the students took  particular delight in. Occasionally a sparsely dressed Chinese Amazon  or some other shapely fiancée would involve herself, drawing  yet more of Furikan's male population out. It had become quite a  side show in Nabiki's opinion, one she worked with ruthless  precision every single day but today.</p><p>As they approached the  gates and the regulars, a couple of girls separated from the crowd  and moved to join them. The taller one's gaze shifted uncertainly  from Nabiki to the crowd behind her and back. "Are you sure about  this boss?"</p><p>"Yeah," The shorter  one with longer straight hair agreed with an equal measure of  uncertainty. Her gaze flicked from Akane to Ranma and lingered,  noting the necklace. "They're starting to ask why we aren't  taking the bets."</p><p>"You didn't tell  'em?" Ranma asked, her thin red eyebrow arched with mild  surprise. Even Akane looked somewhat shocked.</p><p>"I only bet on sure  things and today you three are <i>far</i> from sure things." Nabiki  explained then returned back to her subordinates. "If we take even  a yen today, we'll regret it." Ranma looked at the girls and  shrugged, continuing forward with Akane. Nabiki stepped aside with  her girls, who continued to stare with rapt curiosity. Instead of  providing them with a clear answer, she simply mumbled, "Sit back  and enjoy the show, girls."</p><p>"PIGTAILED GIRL, I  BESEACH THEE!"</p><p>Ranma and Akane stopped  three meters from the gate as Kuno stepped out from behind the wall  in his traditional gray hakama, bokken  in hand. The crowd around them backed off as what appeared to be  morning tradition got underway. Akane separated herself from her  redheaded partner and Ranma affected a weary sigh. "Whaddya want,  Kuno?"</p><p>"To free thy fiery  beauty from the grasp of the evil sorcerer Saotome!" The  upperclassman proclaimed, slicing the wooden sword through the air  with flourish.</p><p>"What else is new?"  She returned rhetorically. Ranma put an impatient hand on her hip and  the weary look was replaced by one of irritation. "Can't we try  somethin' else for a change?"</p><p>"Perhaps we shall."  The bokken wavered from its bearing slightly and his head tilted, as  if thinking on the matter. After a few more seconds of silent  comtemplation, Tatewaki's attention seemed to snap back onto the  girl. "A kiss!"</p><p>Ranma did a double take  on the Kuno. "A <i>what?</i>"</p><p>"A kiss shall break  the spell!"</p><p>"Well ya ain't  getting' one!" She belted back, balling her fists. "In fact,  yer gonna have to kick my ass first!"</p><p>The bokken came back  up. "So be it! Much as it pains me to do so, it appears I am forced  to extract a passionate kiss from your sensual lips by violent means!  I STRIKE!"</p><p>What followed was a  scene that nearly everybody in attendance had seen many times before.  Kuno's blade came down through a quick arc and Ranma was already  inside its length, dodging the initial slice. Students watched as the  pigtailed girl dodged, weaved and jumped in and out of the kendoist's  attacks. Few noticed the strand of glistening sparkle around her  next, refracting the morning light and the few that did dismissed it  as either a trick of the eye or yet more of the easily dismissible  chaos that frequented Nerima on a regular basis. Nabiki glanced over  to Akane, studying her younger sister, the collaborator. She wasn't  sure which was more unnerving at the moment—the fact that she  managed to keep it a secret for so long or that she was still playing  the part of the annoyed, jealous fiancée. Her face continued  to flicker with emotion for the world to see; aggravation, resent and  general annoyance. Nabiki shook her head, kicking herself yet again  for having missed the boat so badly. Akane had said it herself last  night… All those acting classes paid off.</p><p>"Is it 'Beat on  Kuno Friday' already?"</p><p>Two more people joined  their small group, looking on as the redhead continued to taunt the  steadily frustrating upperclassman, who had yet to land a blow of any  sort. Daisuke chuckled at his friend's comment. "What are you  talking about? I thought that was everyday."</p><p>"True." Hiroshi  smiled, watching Ranma back flip out of the Kuno's range before  reengaging. "It's always open season on Kuno."</p><p>Ranma's friends,  Nabiki calculated almost unconsciously as new variables came into  play. Did they have a part to play in this? She watched as the pair  joked and pointed at the martial arts antics and mentally scolded  herself. <i>Now I'm jumping at shadows</i>. Keep this up and I'll  start believing I'm the only one out of the loop, she reasoned. If  Kasumi barely knew what was going on, chances are friends like  Hiroshi, Daisuke, Yuka and Sayuri didn't have a clue. Movement off  to her right snatched the Tendo's attention away from the  conspiracy theory to find a new girl with long black hair dressed in  the Furinkan males' uniform, immediately identifying her to Nabiki  as fiancée number two. She nudged her way through the crowd  and stopped beside the middle Tendo, pulling paper yen from a wallet.</p><p>"What's running on  my Ran-chan, today, Nabi-</p><p>"Pools are closed,  Kuonji." Nabiki cut the fiancée off, pushing the proffered  money back to Ukyo. The girl simply blinked and the middle Tendo  fought the urge to roll her eyes. Yeah, it was killing her too.</p><p>"Then what's going…  on?" Ukyo's voice trailed off into a curious tone and Nabiki  watched as the chef's eyes widened. After a moment of silence, a  queer smile began to spread across her face.</p><p>"Kuonji, you still  with me?" The sister arched an eyebrow and the smile grew. Ukyo  pointed subtly over her shoulder and behind her. Nabiki followed the  pointing finger and turned around, only to have her own eyes widen  involuntarily. There was Hiroshi watching the fight. Behind him was  Daisuke. And Akane. In close proximity. <i>Very</i> close proximity.  In fact, one could accuse them of… <i>snuggling!</i> Daisuke was  directly in back of Akane with his arms wrapped around her  possessively while she too watched the fight. Nabiki tried to keep  her jaw from hanging open but failed. Yuka and Sayuri weren't  fairing much better, off to the side gawking, but she could hardly  blame them… <i>Which is why, unlike everybody else, fiancée  number two is smiling</i>, Nabiki realized as the pit in her stomach  grew. It was almost reasonable to assume, after all, that Akane had  made her choice and that choice wasn't Ranma. Logic following, if  Akane was no long in the game, Ukyo herself probably had the best  shot at Ranma's hand in marriage. Nabiki just shook her head. She  would have been the same conclusion if not for a few unpleasant  revelations over the last forty eight hours. In fact, she almost felt  a twinge of pity for the girl, pity that manifested itself in the  most unlikely of manners.</p><p>"Kuonji… Don't."</p><p>Ukyo turned her smile  back onto Nabiki and her poker face. "Don't' what?</p><p>"Don't get your  hopes up." The smile faded ever so slightly as her meaning was  clearly conveyed. Nabiki motioned over toward the dueling Saotome and  Kuno. "Take a close look at him… Her."</p><p>The Okanomiyaki  master's head swiveled on to the fight and watched Ranma dance  through the kendoist's attacks. Most of the attention was still on  the fight, but Akane aside, little seemed out of the—"Uh, what's  that around Ran-chan's neck?"</p><p>"<i>What the hell are  you doing, man!"</i> Nabiki spared a sigh of relief for the  distraction as the hissed question reached her ears. Both girls  turned to find Hiroshi staring at his friend and Akane with bug eyes.  "Let her go! Ranma's gonna kill you if he sees that! And I don't  mean just kill. I mean martial arts pretzel suicide kill!"</p><p>Yuka had also finally  found her voice. "Um, Akane… don't you think…"</p><p>"And now for my final  attack!"</p><p>All attention turned  back to the fight as Tatewaki Kuno stepped out of melee range  suddenly, pointing his bokken squarely at his redheaded opponent.  Nabiki could barely suppress a groan. It was all orchestrated. They  had orchestrated the entire damn thing. Not just the fight. That one  was obvious. But critical information was being released in measured  shockwaves by the trio, shockwaves that were designed to bury their  audience under one stunning event after another. <i>To leave them a  nonsensical gibbering mess, I'd assume,</i> Nabiki thought in an  acerbic tone.</p><p>"Well then make it  snappy. School starts in five." Ranma retorted impatiently, facing  the boy as if she hadn't been dodging his attacks for the last ten  minutes.</p><p>"Indeed I shall!"  Tatewaki Kuno suffused, swiping his bokken low and to the left.  "Prepare yourself!"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Ranma  returned, clearly bored and studying a spec of dirt in her  fingernails. "Let me know when—"</p><p>Kuno, blurred forward  at speeds the crowd never thought possible, forcing Ranma to evade on  what looked to be pure reflex, jumping out and away from the sword  thrust. This time the upperclassman managed to sustain the rush and  stay with the Saotome as she backpedaled through the evasion. In  fact, some of the more observant students were noting that the  upperclassman had ceased trying to hit Ranma with the wooden sword  and seemed content with merely pursuing her through her flips and  rolls. The redhead feinted right and circled off Kuno's flank, but  the boy recovered quickly, shutting down what could have been an  avenue of attack hastily before retaking the offensive. He moved  through his own feint, pushing just ahead of the girl's movements  and sidestepped one last time, putting his body directly into her  path. Nearly every eye on the ground of Furinkan widened as Ranma ran  into Kuno, a force which the upperclassman absorbed easily and  transformed into a soft embrace in order to keep the martial artist  from falling over on her own momentum. The moment hung in time as  they stared at one another while the entire student body stared on in  disbelief over the fact that Kuno had actually managed to catch  Ranma.</p><p>The kendoist leaned  forward, dipping Ranma back slightly in the embrace. They were face  to face now and there was no mistake as to his intentions. "I shall  now dispel the curse."</p><p>The words were soft and  the kiss was even softer. Tatewaki Kuno closed the last remaining  inch and pressed his lips to Ranma's, who seemed rather stiff in  the improvised embrace. The crowd gawked. There was nothing else they  could do. Even the stray teacher wandering by couldn't help but to  stop and stare as the insane Kuno attempted to ply his lips to  another unwilling female. Oh, sure, his inevitable death was a  foregone conclusion. After all, everybody remembered what happened  Mikado during the Charlotte Cup skating competition. Somehow, Ranma's  female lips had been caught yet again and if past experience was any  indication, the offending male was about to die. Horribly.</p><p>The girl's rigid body  slackened and the crowd cringed. An arm freed itself and began to  move toward the upperclassman. This was it: The beginning of the end  of Tatewaki Kuno. No amount of money would save him now. The police  would be lucky if there were— The earth vibrated as jaws began to  hit the ground one after another. One arm snaked around the kendoist  back, securing the girl's hold and pulling the pair loser. The  other snaked <i>up</i> his back where Ranma's delicate fingers  found his head, running them through his dark hair and deepening the  kiss further.</p><p>Nabiki had suspect  something like this was coming. Heck, she had all but <i>known</i>  it was coming, but that didn't stop her from eating dirt like half  the students around her before the pair finally came up for air,  staring at one another longingly. There was absolutely no mistaking  the intimacy in their gaze toward one another. Nabiki shook the  facefault off and fought to tear her eyes away from the passionate  pair. A quick glance over to her sister revealed a satisfied smile on  her face, similar to the one worn by Daisuke, who was now nuzzling  her neck.</p><p>"That was nice."  Ranma murmured as Kuno pulled her back upright. She wore her own  satisfied smile, one clearly seen by the awed audience.</p><p>"Truly, but you <i>did</i>  let me win." He stroked her cheek affectionately and the girl  shrugged.</p><p>"Maybe, but we both  got what we wanted." Ranma smiled and gave Tatewaki a soft peck on  the cheek before disengaging from the embrace entirely.</p><p>The school bell chimed  the commencement of school, yet nobody moved. Instead, it signaled  the eruption of total chaos.</p><p>"What was <i>that?</i>!<br/>"Ranma LET Kuno kiss  her?<br/>"Him! Ranma is a  him!"<br/>"That didn't look  like no guy on guy kiss to me!"<br/>"That's gross!"<br/>"I'm not sure if I  should call that romantic or just puke my brains out."<br/>"No, romantic. Erotic  even."<br/>"In front of  everybody!"<br/>"So what does that  make Ranma now?"<br/>"Insane. He… SHE  kissed Kuno of all people."<br/>"Ranma's always was  a little weird."<br/>"I'd be weird too  after half the stuff he goes through."<br/>"She."<br/>"But… KUNO?"<br/>"Drugs. Gotta be  drugs."<br/>"Maybe a bump on the  noggin."<br/>"Temporary amnesia?"<br/>"No way."<br/>"Seriously. I knew  this couple who got stranded on an island and lost their memory."<br/>"You're making that  up. I vote alien experimentation."<br/>"But they lost their  memories and shacked up, only to remember later that they were—"<br/>"I'M GOING TO KILL  HIM!"</p><p><i>WHAM!</i></p><p>A giant spatula  whistled through the air and came down in a lethal arc, forcing Ranma  and Tatewaki to separate before either was cleaved in half. The edge  dug itself into the ground halfway and an almost feral Ukyo stared on  the pair with a look that would have melted… well, just damn near  anything.</p><p>"Uh, Uc-chan…"</p><p>"I'll deal with  your drugged, alien experimented amnesic ass later, Ran-chan." Ukyo  hefted the combat spatula out of the ground and turned it menacingly  onto the Kuno. "But first, this jackass <i>dies.</i>"</p><p>"I'm sure I we can  explain—" The upperclassman never got a chance to finish his  sentence as the lethal cooking implement streaked through the air his  head had previously occupied only moments ago. It would have been  neatly removed from his shoulders too, if not for the hasty step out  of range.</p><p>"Shuttup!" the  spatula carved through the air once more as she advanced on the boy.  "First you're going to tell me what drug, spell or magic necklace  you used to seduce my Ran-chan. <i>Then</i> you die. Painfully. And  in many, <i>many</i> pieces."</p><p>"Dammit, Uc-chan, it  was my choice!" The spatula froze. "Been datin' for about three  months now!"</p><p>The Okanomiyaki master  turned slowly back to the redhead even as the crowd twittled with the  new information. "Three….?"</p><p>"<i>Months.</i> Of my  own free will." Ranma confirmed, and a mixture of sadness of fury  met her eyes.</p><p>"But… How… It's…"  The chef's spatula dropped to the earth edge first, managing to  remain upright on impact. "But… <i>Kuno!</i> You'd rather have  Kuno than <i>me?"</i></p><p>Ranma opened her mouth  to reply, but was preempted when Ukyo felt a gentle hand on her  shoulder. She turned around and found Akane with a somewhat sad,  serene expression. Holding her hand was Ranma's own friend,  Daisuke. The mob continued to gasp scandalously at the sight.</p><p>"It was never going  to work, Ukyo."</p><p>"But… but!"  Ukyo's head whipped from Akane and over to her fiancé. "It  could have! I would have made it!"</p><p>"I thought that once  too." The youngest Tendo nodded as Ranma walked over. Tatewaki  wisely maintained his distance. "But none of us had any choice in  the matter. Not me, not you, and least of all, not her."</p><p>"Ranma's a <i>him</i>,  dammit!"</p><p>"I haven't been a  him for a while, Uc-chan." Ranma shook her head with a resolute  sadness that was more for the girl in front of her than herself.  "That stopped being bearable a while ago."</p><p>"It would have been!"  Ukyo protested, her voice riding the edge of pleading. "We would  have had fun together!"</p><p>"'Bout as much fun  as two people forced together could, probably." The martial artist  shook her head. "Face it, Uc-chan, you got too much riding on me.  Your family name, your womanhood, your art and your life. You got  about as much choice as I do about marryin' Akane."</p><p>"Which is absolutely  none." Akane inserted her agreement. "The pressure ate what  little we had alive. Trust me when I say this, Ukyo, it would have  gotten to you too eventually."</p><p>"But…!"</p><p>"But your old man is  just as bad as mine and Akane's." Ranma interjected. "Forcin'  you out of the house on a quest for vengeance as a guy? What's that  kind of person gonna do to us if we do get together? I'll tell  ya—Harp on us and interfere until he grinds our freedom to dust."  Ukyo remained silent with the point, prompting Ranma to glance around  at the eavesdropping crowd. "Look, let's talk about this a lunch.  I owe my best friend the full story at very least."</p><p>Hollow eyes looked back  at Ranma and the chef looked like she was about ready to protest, but  instead simply nodded. Ukyo Kuonji turned away with slumped shoulders  and the crowd parted for her, opening a path back to the school  building. The redhead's gaze fell to the combat spatula the girl  had left behind. "That coulda gone better."</p><p>"Or worse." Akane  noted, stepping up to her side. "She knows it's true, too."</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma  nodded. "She wouldn't have left without breakin' a few skulls  if she didn't at least suspect it."</p><p>Nabiki watched the pair  from the edge of the crowd, shaking her head. Who would have thought  that baby sister could be so… diplomatic? But then, she was  probably right. It was easy to be diplomatic when you didn't have a  mountain of pressure pressing down on you, a mountain that Ranma  herself had effectively eliminated. Nabiki Tendo shook her head and  silently began to formulate her own plans for the remainder of the  day. "One fiancee down and two fiancées, one mistress, two  fathers, and one mother to go."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>R</b>eparations…<p>Ranma rolled the word  around on his tongue as he walked through the park. Once again, and  in his own insane way, Tatewaki Kuno was right again. After nearly  two years, two failed weddings and a countless number of dates,  kidnappings and duels, their relationship had finally imploded under  the pressure cooker of stress. Two years, down the drain. The martial  artist gritted his teeth, stepping between the golden shafts of light  produce by the trees and setting sun. Ranma Saotome didn't lose,  but these last few months were apparently the exception to the rule.  It was a fact that he had slowly come to terms with, though that  hardly lessened the sting, or the fact that he owed Akane. Big time.  She had been relying on him and he failed, consoling in Kasumi while  he hid from the world in Tate's mansion. His personal honor had  been tarnished and now reparations were definitely in order.</p><p>"Yo, Ranma!" The  voice broke him from his musings and the pigtailed boy focused on the  new figure walking into the park towards him. "Got the note. What's  with all the cloak and dagger stuff, anyway?"</p><p>"Didn't tell  anybody, right?" Ranma pressed back in place of a normal greeting,  though he did manage a slight smile at the cloak and dagger comment.</p><p>Daisuke studied his  friend for a moment, the shrugged. "You said it's important, so  it's important." Ranma nodded with the information. Nobody had  followed his friend, or if they had, they were far more skilled than  even his own formidable abilities detect. "What's up, anyway."</p><p>"Got a girlfriend,  Dai?" The question came out of the total blue causing the classmate  to stop short.</p><p>"Is that a trick  question, Oh Mister "I've got so many fiancées I could  puke"? Of course Daisuke knew that they were a constant source of  angst in his friend's life, but that didn't mean he was about to  let Ranma off easy.</p><p>The martial artist  chuckled slightly, kicking a stone at his feet away. The answer was,  of course, no, but he had to be sure. Last thing he needed for this  was to create another love octagon. There were days when he simply  prayed to God for a simpler shape. A mere triangle would be welcome  at this point. "Yeah, yeah. Just askin…. So?"</p><p>"Not unless you count  Hiroshi's magazines." The friend snorted. Ranma's smile  vanished.</p><p>"That's why you're  here and he's not."</p><p>Daisuke blinked. This  was just getting <i>odd</i>. "Oooookay….?"</p><p>"Look, what I'm  about ta tell ya doesn't go beyond us, got it?" Ranma continued,  totally serious now.</p><p>"Uh, yeah."</p><p>Ranma took a deep  breath and focused on the orange sunset sky. "Akane and I aren't…  <i>Together</i> anymore."</p><p>"WHAT!" Daisuke  nearly fell over. "You gotta be kidding! She dumped you?</p><p>"Ain't and no."  Ranma confirmed, leaving the teen gawking. "We both decide it just  wasn't gonna work."</p><p>"Damn, man. I don't  know what to say…" Which was entirely true. Most of Furinkan  considered their relationship nigh indestructible, the stuff of  legends. They had been through kidnappers, martial arts challenges,  fiancées, Amazons, demigods… They had been through it all,  and now it was over.</p><p>"It was comin'  anyway. Probably better this way." Ranma shrugged, failing to  convince Daisuke with his nonchalant attitude. "Still, she needs  somebody ta help her through."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Somebody who ain't  a martial artist. Somebody normal." <i>Somebody who won't attract  the crazies or overshadow everything she hopes to ever accomplish in  martial arts,</i> Ranma added mentally, knowing full well that  external pressure wasn't the sum total of their relationship  problems. "Know anybody like that?"</p><p>"Half of Furinkan?"  Daisuke chuckled. "But seriously, most of the student body worships  the ground she walks on."</p><p>"Which is why I  figure she needs somebody safe." Ranma agreed. "No sports clubs,  no mobs, no martial arts dating challenges. Somebody I know and ain't  a pervert."</p><p>"Sounds reasonable."  Daisuke nodded. "Who do you have in mind?"</p><p>The smile reappeared on  Ranma's lips. He didn't like the looks of it. "I'm lookin'  at him."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes;</b><br/>Thanks for bearing with  me as I slowly work us into the meat of the plot. I know, I forgot to  turn Ranma into a mary sue nympho again, but I promise to next time.  I really don't have much to comment on atm, other than thank you  for giving this fic a chance. I estimate probably 2 more parts, three  maybe. Then again, it's a fact that my estimates are crap so just  assume 10-20 and we'll call it even.<p>Thanks to everybody who  replied to my plea for an editor on my main ffnet page. I've  received a number of emails and will likely rotate through them as to  not burn any one person out with my laziness.</p><p>Special Thanks goes to  TriMatter and McClown and MageOhki, whom I routinely bounce ideas off  of to ensure I'm not going off the deep end, not to mention UncleLou for services rendered in the editing and grammar department. Thank you much all yas.</p><p>Quote  of the Day Trimatter: <i>my  wife is giving me the "feed me" eyes</i></p>
