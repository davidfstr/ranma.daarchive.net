</div><p><b>Kunoification<br/></b>By  Ozzallos<br/>Edited  by <i>Quizer</i></p><p><b>Chapter  2</b></p><p>"<b>I</b>t's  over, isn't it?"</p><p>Had the  parents heard these words, it would have spelled certain doom for the  pair now facing one another in the confines of the Tendo Dojo. Their  parents would have immediately dropped into  DEFCON one in a last desperate attempt to marry the wayward couple  whose destiny had been decided for them nearly eighteen years ago. If  that weren't enough, each had their own individual disasters waiting  for them in the wings. Had Ranma's  fiancées heard those words uttered, whatever fleeting peace he  had would be destroyed beyond every recognition in their attempts to  wed and bed him. If the school knew Akane was free, the Furinkan  militia known as the Hentai Horde would be reactivated and its former  officers given battlefield commissions. Then there was the matter of  Nabiki. It didn't take much imagination to figure out what would  happen on <i>that</i> front if word got out there.</p><p>In  short, they'd have to kill anybody who heard those words spoken  aloud.</p><p>Getting  some time alone together was remarkably easy for Akane and Ranma. He  had just come home after piecing himself back together at Kuno's, to  an Akane who was similarly ravaged by the day's events. It had only  been through the liberal application of violence that she had been  able to maintain a twenty foot zone of  exclusion around her person. Even Nodoka had been sufficiently  cowed by the crater that now resided in the front courtyard, courtesy  of the youngest Tendo's fist. Then Ranma came home and it was  immediately obvious that private time would be at a premium. That  was, after all, why he had retreated to Kuno's to begin with. In the  end, getting time away with Akane had been quite simple. All it took  was an overused insult concerning Akane's  masculinity and a subtle wink in her direction. Akane got the  message and promptly arranged for his departure via her fist. After  that, it had been easy to circle around and meet in the dojo  covertly. Not even Nabiki was going to risk tailing either at the  present levels of stress and violence displayed today.</p><p>Akane  looked to the pigtailed martial artist before her and considered the  words herself with a frown. "If they had just left it alone..."</p><p>"Wishful  thinkin'." Ranma commented despondently. "They ain't ever gonna  give us a moment's peace, married or no."</p><p>The girl  with cobalt blue hair nodded. It just wasn't going to work. Heck,  they had nearly three years and two weddings to be convinced of that  fact. After all, you can only spit into  the wind for so long before you get tired of the soaking, and Akane  and Ranma were drenched. "We can't exactly just end it, you  know..."</p><p>Ranma  sighed. "Yeah, I know. <i>Damn</i> them." The couple now stared  off into space as they each sought some way -  <i>any way</i> - to extract  themselves from their predicament. "And we can't just tell 'em  outright."</p><p>A  horrified look crossed Akane's face. "Are you kidding? God knows  what they'd do if we did that!"</p><p>The boy  merely grunted in agreement. No way could they tell the parents  outright. "Right, and we can't let on to the fact either..."</p><p>"Which  means..."</p><p>"...We're  gonna have to keep up appearances until we find a way outta this  mess." Ranma finished Akane's spoken thought.</p><p>"If we  can stay sane that long..." She grumbled, a sentiment Ranma  wholeheartedly agreed with.</p><p>"Yeah  well..." Ranma groused, "As long as I keep up with the insults  and you with the mallets, it should buy us some time."</p><p>Now it  was Akane's turn to sigh. "But I don't want to mallet anybody!"  Ranma shot her an amused look. "Okay, sometimes I do, but I just  want a normal life! Is that too much to ask?"</p><p>Ranma's  amusement grew. "Around here?"</p><p>Akane  sniffed with mock contempt. "Around <i>you</i>."</p><p>The  martial artist's shoulders slumped and his mirth died away. "Truth  hurts."</p><p>The  youngest Tendo closed the distance between them and put a gentle hand  on his face. "I didn't mean it like that... It's just... I wouldn't  mind a <i>normal</i> boyfriend from time to time."</p><p>Ranma  took his eyes off the floor and met hers. "I know... not like I can  help being a walking tempest of destruction. Like I'm the freakin'  god of chaos incarnate or somthin'."</p><p>"Or  maybe somebody is pulling on the strings of our life behind the  scenes?" Akane added with a slight smile. Ranma returned it.</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>They  both smiled, finding a small point of humor in an otherwise hopeless  situation. It faded quickly with Akane's next words. "So where does  that leave us?"</p><p>"Same  ol' same ol', I guess." Ranma admitted. "I can probably keep 'em  off your back at least, being the scapegoat and all."</p><p>Akane's  frown deepened. He was right...The truth <i>did</i> hurt. And not  just him. Even after she had stopped reflexively blaming him for  every wrong under the sun, Ranma still caught more than his share of  flak; if not from the other fiancées, then the rivals. Those  occurrences had been steadily dwindling, but the parents... The  parents were the constant in both their lives and whenever something  went wrong, it was traditionally his fault. "That'll keep them at  arm's length for a little while, but what about a long term plan?"</p><p>"Plan?"  Ranma grinned "You oughta know me better than that."</p><p>"How  could I forget," Akane snorted. "Mister 'make  it up as I go'."</p><p>"My  specialty." Ranma stuck out his tongue in retaliation. "Don't  worry. I'll figure something out. For both of us."</p><p>Akane  Tendo arched an eyebrow in exaggerated skepticism. Truth be told,  that was one ability she had total confidence in. Ranma didn't plan  per se, but he was a master chop artist. His ability to adapt to any  situation and formulate tactics on the fly was second only to his  near legendary skill as a martial arts prodigy. Lord knew she had  seen it first-hand enough times to be totally secure in that aspect  of his abilities. You could only watch him turn near impossible  situations around so many times before just accepting the undeniable  facts. But he wouldn't have needed to in the first place if his  mother hadn't... "Why couldn't it just go our way for once?"</p><p>Ranma  shrugged. "Beats the hell outta me." Then he favored Akane with a  fond look. "But at least I got somethin' outta this whole mess."</p><p>Akane's  serious mask began to reflect Ranma's own warm smile. "Yeah, I  think I did too."</p><p>The rest  of the night was nearly text book with one exception, in that a  friendship had survived where an engagement had not. Soun, Genma and  Nodoka's attempts at rapid damage control were circumvented through a  concept previously unknown to the engaged couple - Tactics. The  predictable attempts at parental intervention were fended off as  Ranma and Akane tag-teamed off one another.  If one got mired in a senseless debate over mistresses, engagements  or the like, the other would throw out a well timed insult that  invariably drew both into a circular argument that derailed and  excluded any engagement plans the adults were attempting to  construct. If things got really bad, Akane would break out the  mallet, which was all but guaranteed to break off any negotiations.</p><p>After  all, it was tough for them to corner Ranma while she was busy chasing  him with a hammer.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"AKANE  KNOWS?" Nabiki Tendo's outburst drew the attention of the entire  establishment Ranma, Tatewaki and herself now ate in. Even as the  words left her lips, she realized how vast an understatement they  were. Akane didn't simply 'know', she was, in fact, complicit in the  entire cover up. Nabiki desperately fought to keep the food in her  mouth from falling out.<p>"You  mean you <i>didn't?</i>" Ranma asked, twirling her pigtail  innocently. The withering glare she earned elicited a smile from the  Kuno.</p><p>Nabiki  managed to ignore the feminine manner in which Ranma played with her  hair. "You know damn well I didn't!" She snapped.</p><p>Ranma  dropping the innocent act in favor of her own smile. "Aw come on,  Nabs... You're so <i>easy!</i>" Another crinkled face from Nabiki  indicated the irony was not lost on her either.</p><p>Nabiki  forced her way past the irritation in favor of some small measure of  self control. The two grinning idiots across from her weren't  helping. "Okay, is anybody <i>else</i> privy to this scheme of  yours that I should know about?"</p><p>"Nay."  Kuno shook his head as Ranma allowed an arm to snake around her  possessively. The redhead seemed to melt into it. "Unless we are to  be surprised ourselves."</p><p>Nabiki  eyed the pair doubtfully. Akane as a collaborator threw every  scenario she was devising out of whack, as it indicated one  significant faction in the fiancée wars had just been  neutralized. That still left Ukyo and the Amazons, however. Nabiki  began running down the remaining likely scenarios, an ability that  was second nature to her thought processes.  She sincerely doubted Ukyo would be a problem. Ranma and the  Okonomiyaki master had been friends long enough to where their  friendship would overcome the initial bluster the news created. The  Amazons wouldn't take it so lightly, however. Even if they accepted  the fact that Ranma was 'going girl', they were more than likely to  try and marry <i>her</i> off to another Amazon male, seeing how it  didn't seem to be a problem for her anymore. Nabiki shivered at that  last thought and a very Shampoo-like voice crept through her head.  <i>Too-too weird.</i></p><p>But the  parents... "You do realize the time bomb you've created here?"  The mischievous smiles faded quickly. Obviously they did, Nabiki  noted. Part of her delighted at her ability to reduce their playful  attitude to ash while the other was staring at the impending  apocalypse forming on the horizon. Akane was the last hope for their  fathers' 'family honor' and if she was okay with all of this... And  why did she have feeling that there was another shoe just waiting to  be dropped?</p><p>"Yeah,  Mom's gonna have my head." Ranma stated with solemn gravity. "Pops  and your old man I could care less about. They wore out their cries  of honor a long time ago." Tatewaki nodded with her words, giving  her a comforting squeeze. "Hell, we were almost over the damn  mistress incident too."</p><p>"We  cannot hope to keep such a secret from the world forever, my radiant  beauty." Nabiki was still in awe over how Ranma simply accepted  Kuno's indulgent titles for her, where as yesterday he was getting  beat into the nearest wall for them.</p><p>Ranma  shrugged with a depressed air about her. "Yeah well, I can wish,  can't I?" Kuno simply nodded, like the perfect understanding  boyfriend he was supposed to be. Nabiki suppressed a twitch. The  scene in front of her reminded her of another nagging question...</p><p>"So  all those fights before school between the both of you...?" She all  but knew the answer. Still, she wanted to hear it for herself.</p><p>"My  love pulls her punches quite masterfully." Kuno smiled knowingly  and Ranma's face glowed a slight pink.</p><p>"That  and we kinda have been teachin' each other." Ranma found Tatewaki's  smile infectious.</p><p>"<i>Teaching</i>  each other?"</p><p>"Yep,  Tachi's pretty good with a katana." The upperclassman inclined his  head slightly with her praise.</p><p>"And  Ra-chan has been teaching me her art as well." Tatewaki explained.  All Nabiki could do was nod dumbly. Ranma? Use a sword? Kuno... <i>Not</i>  use one? She wasn't sure which concept was more outlandish. A waiter  came by and laid down the check, to which Ranma's date laid out a  large bill. "Perhaps we should continue the telling outside."</p><p>Nabiki  eyed the money as the pair stood up from the table. "Aren't you  going to wait for the change?"</p><p>"No."  Came the simple reply.</p><p>Nabiki  eyed Ranma now. "That's an awful lot of money to just leave  behind."</p><p>"It's  called a tip, Nabs."</p><p>Nabiki  Tendo fell over.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Airen!"<p>"Ranma-honey!"</p><p>"Ranma-samaaaaa!"</p><p>The  Airen-Ranma-Honey-Sama in question let loose an involuntary shiver as  three separate forces of feminine nature came to bear on the wayward  martial artist. Since the collapse of the second wedding, the  pressure exerted by the remaining girls increased exponentially, and  what began as an effort to screen Akane from her parents rapidly  degenerated into panicked retreat. It might not have been so bad if  the aforementioned fiancées hadn't declared a temporary  ceasefire in order to corner their prey more effectively. Ranma  doubled back to the dojo, hoping to God that the same tactics that  worked on their parents worked on the fiancées.</p><p>Ranma  round the corner and leapt over the wall, finding Akane helping  Kasumi hang clothing in the dojo courtyard. "Akane! Large-waisted  Tomboy!" Akane almost couldn't suppress the smile as the three  fiancées hopped over the wall behind him. She managed to reign  it in and instead affected a look of rage, calling her ki mallet into  existence. She tossed the hammer from one hand to the other and wound  back, seeing the relief in Ranma's eyes.</p><p>"<i>Two  timing pervert baka!"</i></p><p><i>WHAM!</i></p><p>The  resultant ballistic arc took Ranma on a twenty second blur over the  Neriman suburb and promptly deposited him into a local water fountain  with a geyser of cold water, which frankly amazed Ranma to no end.  Between the water attraction inherent in the curse and Akane's  ability to punt him into the nearest body of water, Ranma found it  really, <i>really</i> creepy... Especially since they were now on  speaking terms. The drenched redhead pulled herself up from the  fountain and mentally calculated the angle of her departure, time  traveled, direction and estimated distance. See? Those math classes  were coming in handy after all. Just outside the shopping district,  Ranma noted, realizing that it wasn't far enough away to lose the  rampaging fiancées. She need time to think, time to unwind and  time to keep from snapping, and the only place that could fill those  impossible requisites was a place of impossibility to begin with.</p><p>Ranma  was over the Kuno estate walls easily and began the task of avoiding  the various traps and pitfalls as she traversed the property to the  back door. She tracked right with light steps to avoid the tripwire  to a shuriken trap, only to have to hop  over a covered pit of sharpened bamboo sticks. It caused her to  smile. If nothing else, the Kunos' were  studious in the matter of home defense. Not one trap was in the same  place since her last visit. Ranma smiled, as it gave her something to  focus on besides the problems waiting for her back in the real world.</p><p>The key  slid into the back door with a well oiled click and Ranma paused  before turning it. She cocked her head curiously and spoke into empty  space. "You ain't plannin' anything stupid are yas?"</p><p>The  diminutive cat faced ninja leapt into existence, kneeling at her  person a few feet away. "Only to inform you that Master Kuno is  practicing in the estate gym."</p><p>"Right."  She replied dryly. "You <i>do</i> know I'm a guy, right?"</p><p>Sasuke  looked up, making eye contact with the redhead for the first time.  "Of course, Mistress." Ranma barely suppressed a flinch at the  title. "I am not quite as blinded by love as Master Kuno." ...Or  as unbalanced, the Ninja thought silently, a thought he was sure  Ranma shared.</p><p>"Okay,  so why ya playin' along?"</p><p>"I  would not be able to convince him otherwise." Sasuke frowned. "To  obstruct you would be foolish under such circumstance."</p><p>"Not  like I haven't tried to tell him myself." Ranma grumbled, and  Sasuke nodded with sympathy.</p><p>"Which  is the only reason I tolerate your continued presence." Ranma  blinked at the retainer's directness. "Perhaps he will come around  in time and we can all end this masquerade."</p><p>Which  would also deny her of her only safe haven at the moment, but that's  not today. Ranma shrugged. "The gym?" Sasuke nodded. She twisted  the key and opened the door, taking one step inside before reality  caught up to her once more. "And exactly where is that...?"</p><p>"I  strike!" Tatewaki stepped through his kendo technique, blurring  into a group of three straw practice dummies. His wooden practice  blade whipped around into a narrow arc, cutting one of the figures  down in a clean slice. The upperclassman reversed the blade and  sidestepped between the remaining targets, taking them out with  surgical precision... And style.</p><p>"Those  theatrics are gonna get you killed."</p><p>The  Kendoist froze mid stroke with those words, and he turned to find a  sight most welcome, in spite of the criticism which blew by  unnoticed. "Even the art of war requires style and grace, my  Pigtailed Goddess." He smiled with a  hint of condescension, as if he were instructing a small child on the  basics of the alphabet. Tatewaki stepped over one of the fallen straw  targets to join the redhead. "Truly, it is the mark of a  warrior-poet such as myself."</p><p>Ranma  rolled her eyes. "Yeah, and while you're busy being all poetic,  I'll be kickin' yer butt." Tatewaki seemed to consider this as  he led his goddess through the mansion halls.</p><p>"Admittedly  you are one of the most formidable maidens I have happened across in  the combat arts. In that, I am not sure whether to thank or curse the  wretched Saotome's influence on you." Ranma shook her head as  she trailed behind the upperclassman. Did she hurt him for the insult  or beam with pride over the compliment? In the end, she called it up  as a draw and decided not to pummel the kendoist. Today.</p><p>"One  of these days you'll realize we're the same person, baka…"</p><p>"Indeed,  one of these days we'll purge you of his foul influence." He  nodded, as if his words were a natural continuation of the redhead's  thought. "But I'll not disturb your peace by broaching such a  topic."</p><p><i>Damn,</i>  Ranma grumbled to herself, lamenting the fact that the kendoist kept  taking away her excuses to bite his head off. She shook her head in  frustration. <i>Whatever…</i> Ranma glanced around as they  journeyed though another large hallway decorated with painting and  sculptures. "So where we goin' anyway?"</p><p>"I  have had a feast prepared in your honor, my pigtailed goddess."  Kuno returned with a self-satisfied smile, causing the aforementioned  pigtailed girl to frown.</p><p>"I  haven't been here ten minutes."</p><p>Tatewaki  waved the fact aside. "I prepare a feast every night on the chance  that you should arrive unexpectedly."</p><p>Ranma  nearly stumbled in the upperclassman's wake. She hadn't been to  his house in days. <i>Weeks</i>, even! And he was having a meal  cooked for her <i>every night!</i> Part of her brain couldn't help  but to admire the sheer amount of insanity  necessary to persist in such delusional behavior, while the other  part… "Ain't that a tad, eh… excessive?"</p><p>"Nonsense."  He replied as the pair approached a pair of rich oak doors. "My  sister has accused me of such behavior, but one has to consider the  source of those accusations."</p><p><i>That  only makes you both—</i> Ranma's thought process stopped cold as  Tatewaki Kuno opened the double doors, admitting her to The Feast.  The words were even capitalized in her mind as she stepped took a  tentative step into the massive dining room, the aroma of finely  prepared food wafting around her. The martial artists' cheek  twitched. The amount of food was simply... She blinked. Then blinked  again. Ranma Saotome, Heir to the Anything Goes School of Martial  Arts was literally stunned, and it had nothing to do with her  normally healthy appetite. She turned slowly back to Kuno, who had  held the door open for her.</p><p>"<i>Every  night?"</i></p><p>"Of  course." Tatewaki returned in utter seriousness. "I shan't be  found negligent in my duties to provide you a place of comfort and  relaxation."</p><p>She  opened her mouth but words failed to come out. Her mind, however, was  working well into the redline. A feast. For me. Every single goddamn  night! <i>For months!</i> Oh, there was no doubt that Tatewaki was  loony beyond even her wildest imagination, however  nobody but <i>nobody </i>had ever given her that sort of  consideration. Sure, the fiancées chased and bribed her with  meals on occasion, but to go through this sort of trouble every  single night just on the off chance she arrived? It was-</p><p>"Is it  not sufficient, my warrior maiden?"</p><p>Ranma  snapped back to the real world and released the breath she had been  holding, staring up at Kuno. "Uh, no, I mean yeah… yeah.  Totally." She shook her head clear of the mental clutter occupying  it. "I mean, look Kuno, ya can't be doing this every night."</p><p>Her host  blinked without comprehension. "Of course I can. You must know  money is no—"</p><p>"Ya  just can't." Ranma interrupted, causing Kuno to cock his head  curiously, but still devoid of comprehension. "It's not like I'm  gonna be stopping by everyday, right?"</p><p>"No  matter." Kuno stated with certainty, folding his arms. "It is a  negligible expense and your—"</p><p>"Stop  it!" Ranma shrieked as her anger finally found something to anchor  to. "Just stop it already! <i>Nobody</i> does this crap for me!  Ever! Not my mom, not my dad, not my damn fiancées! There's  always strings attached! Everybody wants something from me, so tell  me, Kuno, whaddya want!"</p><p>The  kendoist studied his pig-tailed goddess carefully as she pulled back  from the edge of hyper ventilation before answering. "Admittedly, I  do vie for your affections, but that much is obvious. Nay, I desire  naught more than your well-being."</p><p>"I…!  You…!" Regardless of how much she tried to force words from her  mouth, all attempts failed as her anger was absorbed into the insane,  eccentric sponge named Tatewaki. And the worst thing about it was  that he was right. Ranma knew she had gone into this eyes wide open.  Desperate for some measure of peace, but open. It wasn't as if he  had hidden his true nature from her either, and there was something  hard at work in the back of her mind, behind the clutter.</p><p><i>Somebody  gives a damn.</i></p><p>No,  Ranma mentally amended. Somebody gives a damn about a busty five foot  one inch tall redhead, not Ranma Saotome. Still, she couldn't help  herself. It felt <i>nice...</i> Nice to not be just another means to  an end for once. After a couple more attempts at communication, the  girl lapsed into silence, first glowering at the Kuno, then loosing a  heavy sigh. "Look, ya can't keep doin' this."</p><p>"And  why is that, my goddess?"</p><p>"Because  you can't!" Ranma bit back, then took another deep breath.  "Jeez, Kuno… I mean, it's just… Too much. Way too much."  Tatewaki continued to stare at her without a clue, so she elaborated  to the best of her abilities. "It's another obligation. You have  a dinner here every night and I feel pressure to do somethin' about  it. Don't need no more obligations. That's the <i>last</i> the last  thing I need."</p><p>The  Kendoist scratched his chin, affecting a noble pose. "Perhaps it is  thus. Indeed, I have thoughts on how you may deal with the pressures  of your life, but come. For now, our repast awaits."</p><p>Oh, God,  Ranma thought as she stepped through the doors and into her own  personal twilight zone. Life must be <i>seriously </i>screwed up when  a Kuno starts giving you advice on living. Even so, living on the  edge of insanity had its perks, she noted, taking in the spectacle  that was The Feast. Duck. Shark fin soup. Dumpling. Sushi of every  sort. Her wide eyes endeavored to take the parade of dishes in. Ranma  had thought her previous visit to the Kuno mansion had been a feast.  She was mistaken. <i>Sadly</i> mistaken. That particular fast food  delivery prank had been eclipsed by so many magnitudes it wasn't  even funny. Tatewaki took opportunity of the redhead's partially  stunned state to herd her to one of the intricately carved chairs,  pulling it out for her. Ranma took the seat without objection,  continuing to stare into the massive spread. Once again, guilt and  hunger united to form an incredibly powerful motivator to sit down  and at least try the food in front of her.</p><p>"Alright,  Kuno. Just this once." She said, reaching for some silverware. It  probably was real silver too, Ranma realized as an afterthought.</p><p>Tatewaki  nodded sympathetically. "Of course. No need to—"</p><p><i>Whiip</i>SNAP!</p><p>"YOW!"  Ranma snatched her hand back, now pulsing a shade as red as her head.  She glared into down the vector of the blur that had snapped at her  hand, finding a dark figure stepping out of the candle lit shadows.</p><p>"My  twisted sister." Tatewaki frowned and Ranma bolted from her chair  with an angry visage plastered across her face.</p><p>"Whaddya  do that for!"</p><p>"That,"  Kodachi Kuno cleared the shadows, revealing her elegant dark purple  dress laced with flowers. She stretched a pink gymnastics ribbon to  tension between her hands."is the wrong fork."</p><p>The  redhead blinked, her anger momentarily stalled. "The wrong…?"</p><p>The  sister rolled her eyes, stepping to the opposite end of the expansive  dining table. "While my brother may be willing to overlook your  peasant ways, I shall not have you disgracing these walls with your  barbarian eating habits."</p><p>"Sister,  this is not the time for a—" Tatewaki was cut of by a swift  gesture from Kodachi.</p><p>"I'll  not tolerate it." She continued haughtily. "Of course, formal  training for such a waif would truly be a futile cause."</p><p>Ranma  leaned forward with the challenge, grinding her teeth. "I've had  plenty of formal training!"</p><p>Kodachi  turned her full attention back to the girl with an arched eyebrow.  "Oh?"</p><p>Ranma  folded her arms with a confident smirk. "I'm a master of Anything  Goes Dining!"</p><p>Now it  was Kodachi's turn to look befuddled, then disdain. "Anything  goes… Ah, now I remember. Your unladylike fascination with martial  arts. And tell me, how did you come to be a recipient of this  primitive training?"</p><p>"Picolette  Chardin the Second." Ranma replied. "Beat him at his own  game!"</p><p>Kodachi's  eyes widened with the explanation, then narrowed with irritation.  "The Chardins? That family is truly a blight on nobility  everywhere."</p><p>For  once, Tatewaki nodded in agreement with his sister. "It is truly  thus, my goddess. Any family whose pedigree is built on the ability  to inhale their food lacks the refinement to be named among true  nobility, doubly so when such standards are used to measure one's  future spouse."</p><p><i>Says  something about my old man</i>, Ranma thought with a trace of humor,  then considered the Kunos in their rare moment of agreement. "So  what are ya sayin'?"</p><p>Kodachi  brought the entwined ribbon to her lip with her fingers as she  contemplated the matter. "How should I put this…" An evil smile  adorned her face, eyes glittering. "It would be remiss to leave you  with such a pathetic view of true nobility, therefore I can only  think of one thing."</p><p>"And  what's that?"</p><p>The evil smile grew, and Kodachi tore away her gown to reveal a form  fitting black and purple leotard. She began to twirl the ribbon at  high speeds. "Your <i>real</i> training begins <i>now.</i>"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki  Tendo took another look at the pair next to her as they strolled down  the sidewalk and away from the restaurant where Kuno had left his  sizable tip. She was beginning to realize the catalyst that brought  this insane pairing into being, but that didn't make it any less  unbelievable. Ranma walked peacefully beside Kuno, contently wrapped  around his arm while the upperclassman had his coiled around her  waist. The middle Tendo shook her head with incredulity for what had  to have been the hundredth time that night, thanking God she was out  in the cool night and its fresh air.<p>She  needed it at this point.</p><p>"You  can't go home like that." She conjured the topic out of thin air,  desperate to break the romantic silence drifting around Ranma and  Tatewaki. It was practically suffocating. Of course, she <i>could</i>  go home like that, but doing so might not  be conducive to her health.</p><p>The  content redhead shrugged, unmoved by the observation. "I just  change over at Tachi's house if I want. After that, it ain't  nothin' to come home a girl after Akane mallets me away."</p><p>"Right,  I almost forgot. Partners in crime." Nabiki noted blandly, earning  an amused smile from the redhead. "So how did you both—"</p><p><i>"OOOHO  HO HO HO HOOOO!"</i></p><p>The  sound sent the slightest of shivers down Nabiki's spine as she  turned, finding Kodachi Kuno perched atop a light pole, her black on  black gown fluttering in the slight breeze. The black rose in her  mouth was a nice touch too. She removed it and pointed down to Ranma.  "There you are, redheaded harlot! Tell me where my Ranma-sama is,  else I shall discipline you!"</p><p>Nabiki  watched Tatewaki make eye contact with his sister, subtly shaking his  head, while Ranma simply smiled. "Hey, Ko-chan, what's up?"</p><p>The  insane sparkle in the young woman's eyes diminished slightly as she  looked curiously upon the couple, then Nabiki, then back to Ranma.  With a slight shrug, she hopped down from the pole gracefully,  landing in front of the trio. Kodachi gave Nabiki one last look.</p><p>"I  see." She stated, then turned her full attention to Ranma. "I've  merely come by to see if you've heard anything from my beloved  Ranma-sama?"</p><p>Ranma  affected a slightly disappointed look. "Sorry, Ko-chan. You know  how he is."</p><p>"Alas,  I do." Kodachi sighed wistfully. "While he is the wild stallion  of his namesake, his constant training missions do border on tedium."</p><p>"Yeah,  know what you mean." Ranma took her hand, and patted it  sympathetically. Kodachi took it gracefully before moving on to other  topics.</p><p>"You  will, of course, be present for the St. Hebereke ball?" She  asked, prompting a smile from Ranma. "I should be disappointed  not to see my lessons pay off."</p><p>"Like I  would miss it." The redhead smiled.</p><p>It was all  Nabiki could do not to gawk at the scene. Granted, Ranma had hinted  at their current state of relations, but this… THIS would drive  lesser women absolutely nutty. Ranma was actually consoling Kodachi  like a good friend while talking about herself in the third person?</p><p>"If you  should see Ranma, please be sure to tell him that I seek his presence  most passionately?" The taller girl asked hopefully and the  shorter one gave her a reassuring smile.</p><p>"Of  course I will."</p><p>Kodachi gave  Ranma's hand a slight squeeze before pulling away, then paused,  turning back to Nabiki as if she were an  afterthought. Her voice dropped several degrees as she  addressed the Tendo. "And should your meddlesome schemes drive a  wedge between my brother and Ra-chan, or push her back to my beloved  Ranma-sama, I shall ensure you regret the remaining days of your life  in a <i>most</i> exquisite manner."</p><p>It was all  Nabiki could do to retain some semblance of composure as Kodachi Kuno  stared her down with a look every bit as icy as any she was capable  of producing herself. She didn't like dealing with Kodachi on a  normal day because not only could she be every bit as ruthless, but  totally lacked any inhibitions to keep that ruthlessness in check.  Nabiki's ruthless, privateering nature was on a self controlled  leash. Kodachi seemed to have no such governors and Nabiki Tendo knew  that was what made her truly dangerous. Selling photos and  information was as far as she was willing to interact with the girl,  because if push came to shove, extorting Kodachi was like juggling  live rattle snakes. You might pull it off, but the consequences of  failure would be quite spectacular.</p><p>Therefore,  it was quite understandable that Nabiki produced a simple nod in  deference to her standard witty response.</p><p>"I see  we have an understanding." Kodachi returned the nod, then  erupted into a fit of insane laughter before leaping off into the  night via a nearby rooftop. Nabiki stood absolutely still a moment  longer before Ranma stepped up to her.</p><p>"Sorry  'bout that," Ranma said. "As you can see, she hasn't  quite…"</p><p>"..  gotten it yet," Tatewaki finished as the couple stared at the  retreating gymnast. "She has been most resilient to our efforts  to…"</p><p>"...  enlighten her on the matter," Ranma said, returning the favor  for Tatewaki.</p><p>Nabiki  looked from boy to girl.</p><p>It took a  few moments for her brain to engage at the sight of Ranma and  Tatewaki seamlessly finishing each others sentences. They even  managed to pull off the other's speech mannerisms. "You don't  say," she finally managed with a shake of her head. She took a  moment to digest what had just happened before continuing. "Okay,  um, where were we?"</p><p>"Think  it's time to call it a night." Ranma shook her head, eliciting a  nod of agreement from her date. "Meetcha back at the dojo,  'kay?"</p><p>"Uh, right." Nabiki repeated, still in a slight daze. "Back  at the dojo." With that, the woman known as the Ice Queen  watched the unlikely couple walk off into the night, hand in hand.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"It just  moved! I swear to God!"<p>Eyes widened  at the remark and an angry red glow enveloped the dining room table,  courtesy of Akane Tendo. She bolted up from her place, burning down  the pigtailed boy across from her with a molten glare.</p><p>"WHAT DID  YOU SAY!" The youngest Tendo leaned forward, prompting the parents  to lean away and out of the line of fire. To be fair, nobody was  actually touching Akane's creation, which could have been loosely  identified as teriyaki chicken if said teriyaki chicken were still  alive, turned inside out and blackened to crispy elemental carbon  blocks. For most of the family, the plan was simple—Admire the  crispy blocks of carbon, wait for Ranma to make his inevitable  comment concerning his fiancée's cooking and escape in the  ensuing carnage.</p><p>The mallet  made its appearance, and the family began to lead off from the table  in anticipation of the commencement of violence. Even Kasumi began to  pull away plates as Akane began her attack run. There was a minor  departure from the regular Ranma-Akane  dinnertime violence, however, and that was in Nabiki. The middle  sister watched with new eyes as the two  traded insults; Ranma dodging Akane's mallet while Akane chased him  around the room. A pitcher of water found the formerly male martial  artist and the chase was on again, this time with Akane pursuing a  red headed pigtailed girl. It was absolutely surreal to realize for  the first time that this was all nothing more than an elaborate  production designed to throw those around them – including herself  – off from the truth. The fact that they played the game so  naturally was a revelation in and of itself for the Ice Queen. <i>Of  course they did</i>, Nabiki rebuked herself. <i>They've only had  two and a half years of practice.</i></p><p>"Happy  couple, eh, Soun?" Genma commented from across the room as Akane  chased Ranma out of the house.</p><p>"Indeed  they are, old friend." Soun nodded with an oblivious smile.</p><p><i>Fools.</i>  Nabiki thought as she stared after the pair. And not just them.  Nabiki shook her head. Under normal circumstances, she wouldn't  think to follow either her sister or her apparently ex-brother in-law  to be. The messes they normally created in their activities tended to  be catastrophic for anybody not either a martial artist or used to  dodging mallets. Apparently, both had played the natural tendencies  of everybody involved to their supreme advantage, and now Nabiki was  left wondering what actually did occur in the shadow of their  presumed fighting.</p><p>With supper  safely a loss, Nabiki ducked out into the Tendo courtyard, moving in  the last known direction the pair was sighted. The dojo? It was a  rather obvious place to hold out, she thought to herself as she  quietly stepped around to the main entrance. Two female voices  filtered through the doorway, all but inviting the middle Tendo to  put her ear to the door for a better take on the conversation.</p><p>"…And  yesterday we went to the beach. It was absolutely beautiful, like a  dream…" Nabiki identified her sister's voice readily, but the  question hung in the air as to who 'we' exactly was in the  conversation.</p><p>"And  romantic?" Ranma questioned in a tone that undoubtedly indicated  that she expected it was indeed romantic.</p><p>"Oh,  <i>definitely </i>romantic." Akane confirmed, leaving the  eavesdropping sister slack-jawed. They weren't just talking about  an outing; they were talking about a date! <i>Akane's</i> date! And  Ranma-! Her brain was on the verge of shutting down when the next  words she heard refocused her attention abruptly.</p><p>"Wait one  sec." Ranma said, then in a louder voice, "Come on in, Nabs!"</p><p>Nabiki  stiffened with the words, but managed to slid the door open despite  the surprise of being found out so quickly. <i>Goddamn martial  artists…</i> was her first thought as she stepped across the  threshold and into the dojo itself. At its center sat Akane smiling  lightly at her, with Ranma sprawled out next to her, also grinning  like an idiot.</p><p>"About  time you showed up, Sis." Akane poked, motioning her to join their  little gathering. "We thought you'd never put two and two  together."</p><p>Nabiki  winced at the reminder, but Ranma brushed it aside. "Don't mind  her. We went through a lot of trouble to make sure you didn't put  two and two together."</p><p>Their  grinning only increased to insufferable levels, forcing the middle  Tendo to massage her temples. They were like best friends, sharing a  joke. <i>Girlfriends</i>. "Alright already, alright. You got me.  Now want to explain just what the hell you two are doing out here?"</p><p>"Think  that would be obvious, Nabs." Ranma shrugged, leaning back.</p><p>"Just  talking." Akane replied innocently.</p><p>"Who  was your date?" Nabiki inquired.</p><p>"Oh...  no one," Akane replied while innocently look toward the ceiling.</p><p>Nabiki  blinked at her younger sister. "Don't give me that! I clearly  heard you! Who is it?"</p><p>"Ah,  c'mon Nabs," Ranma broke in. "You know that a girl has to  have some secrets."</p><p>Nabiki gave  Ranma a half glare, half pout as Akane giggled at having caught her  older sister so flat footed.</p><p>"My ass!"  Nabiki exploded suddenly, causing the pair to blink cluelessly. It  only served to push her annoyance to unheard of levels. "Ranma just  got done insulting your cooking no less than ten minutes ago and now  you're out here all buddy-buddy! I know it's supposed to be an  act, but… but…"</p><p>"'Kane-chan's  actually a decent cook." Ranma pointed out, causing Akane to nod.  "She has to try pretty hard these days to do <i>that.</i>"</p><p>"So even  the cooking is…?" Nabiki grasped at the inevitable conclusion.  Out of the entire scene, she was sure at least that part was real.  Akane equaled toxic culinary delights. It was the way of things.  Always had been. Oh sure, everything after that was undoubtedly a  convenient byproduct of the food, but…</p><p>"Ha!"  Akane smirked. "Even I wouldn't try that stuff."</p><p>Nabiki's  face lost all cohesion and she sank to her knees beside the girls,  totally and completely lost. Reality as she knew it was a lie. A  complete and utter lie.</p><p>"I think  we broke her." Ranma pointed out, looking closely at the older  girl. Nabiki simply shook her head.</p><p>So even the  food was a lie. Her sister was a decent cook. "And splashing Ranma  with the water, A-chan?"</p><p>"All part  of the show." Akane confirmed with satisfaction, prompting Nabiki  to take a deep breath and collect her thoughts.</p><p>The  revelation prompted yet more questions beyond the fact that her  reality had just been upturned. Again. Ranma had come home from  Kuno's date a guy. When, exactly had that happened? And why had  they planned the change to her female body? The same scheme could  have worked without that little detail and nobody would have batted  an eye.</p><p>"So the  change to the girl really is…"</p><p>"A  preference." Ranma stated without shame. Nabiki studied the redhead  before her closely, scrutinizing her body language. It wasn't  guarded or on edge, which was admittedly an oddity concerning the  Saotome she once knew. She was more… relaxed?</p><p>The  realization prompted another insight, which she voiced aloud. "So  it was that bad?"</p><p>The smile Ranma had worn since she had first walked in diminished  slightly. "You got no idea."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  Saotome, heir of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts ruthlessly  laid into the sparring post before her, unleashing yet another  devastating combo into its steel reinforced frame. The target in  question was now the focus of two weeks of pent up frustration as it  absorbed blow after blow in the form of pulverizing fists, lethal  kicks and occasionally a ki-born special technique.<p>The first  two sparring posts were currently battered, molten slag.</p><p>It was  actually a testament to the Kuno estate gym, part of the redhead's  brain noted. She had been unloading here for the better part of a  month now and somehow it was always in pristine condition when she  returned to trash it. It wasn't quite therapy, but it was close.  There was just something about absolutely destroying something that  kept getting rebuilt week after week that was oh-so gratifying; or at  least gratifying enough to overlook the fact that Kuno was having it  rebuilt each an every time just for her.</p><p>"<i>Kachu  Tenshu Ameguriken!"</i></p><p>The  vocalization of the technique wasn't absolutely necessary to loose  its potential, but it did help to vent some of the resentment pent up  in her tiny frame. Upwards of three-hundred fists per second smashed  into the target dummy, nearly uprooting it from its bolted  foundation.</p><p><i>Damn  parents! </i></p><p>She growled  mentally, forcing another aerial combination into the faltering post.  It was a familiar litany to Ranma Saotome, but one almost exclusively  directed at his father, the fat old panda. As of the collapse of the  second wedding, however, that all changed. Of course, her and Akane's  father were still the sources of endless angst with their incessant  scheming to push them into marital bliss, but those were the good ol'  days. Now her mother was involved, and the situation had become  exponentially worse. The incident with the mistress was just the tip  of the ice berg. It was bad enough that she was giving her full  backing to ol' Pops and Soun to push forward with marriage ops. It  was worse that she had come up with the mistress deal. No, what  really took the cake was the fact that she was now going behind their  backs to clandestinely negotiate with the <i>other</i> fiancées  in an attempt to 'occupy' his free time. The growl manifested  itself audibly with the thought and she spun around on one leg,  targeting the post.</p><p><i>Now  here's something I can't do as a guy!</i></p><p>The other  leg snapped up from the knee and blurred in, pulverizing the sparring  post at speeds better than the original chestnut fist. The kicks also  held more power, and the metal frame only took two and a half seconds  of the new technique before the anchor bolts sheered away entirely.  Kick number two hundred and eighty three sent the post flying across  the room at high speed, embedding it into the wall horizontally less  than a half second later. The redhead recovered from the kick and  winced, first at the sound of a shattering wall, then at said wall  crumpling in.</p><p>The activity  was sufficiently violent enough to suspend her roiling anger, and she  cocked her head, staring at the destruction she had once again  wrought on the Kuno manor. I've really got to stop tearing his  place up like this, she thought to herself, stepping around the  mangled post while admiring her handiwork. She had noted a long time  ago that her female body was slightly faster than her birth form, but  it wasn't until these private 'therapy' sessions that she found  out the other primary benefit, it being far more flexible. While the  marginal increase in speed wasn't enough to make up the deficit in  strength, that combined with her innate flexibility was. It allowed  her to perform techniques such as these, negating her handicap in  upper-body strength by substituting her legs instead. She was coming  to the point where her legs could hit with more power than her  boy-type fist and with more accuracy than her boy-type legs. Not that  she had originally set out to train her girl-type up in such a  manner… It just came as a natural consequence of wanting to kick  the living crap out of something, <i>anything</i> in order to vent.</p><p>Fatigue  began to set in and Ranma wiped the perspiration from her brow,  surveying the destruction. This particular anger management session  had sustain three casualties and she briefly considered adding the  single remaining sparring post as a forth, but found her anger had  fallen to more manageable levels. <i>Next time</i>, she threatened  the post before turning for the door. What she found caused her to  stop short.</p><p>"Kuno."</p><p>It wasn't  quite a hiss, but the title did contain a measure of displeasure. He  knew the rules. Her sessions here were hers and hers alone. No  intrusions, no spying. Violations of said rules would not only risk  her abrupt departure from the premises, but a violent beat-down with  his name on it. The upper classman seemed to realize this breach of  protocol and inclined his head in apology.</p><p>"Forgive  me, my fiery warrior-maiden, but I could not help but to notice the…  intensity of your workout." Tatewaki explained, stepping around her  temper carefully.</p><p>Try as she  might, the martial artist found it supremely hard to direct any of  her rage at the kendoist, especially when he used such corny titles  for her. Amusement warred with simmering anger as she formulated a  response. "Whaddya mean?"</p><p>Tatewaki  peered around the door frame, observing the demolished post embedded  in the wall next to him. "I should perhaps have the walls  reinforced as well, as this one nearly felled one of my loyal  retainers."</p><p>Ranma's  eyes widened suddenly and she rushed around Kuno and out into the  hallway, where her eyes widened further. Once again, there was the  familiar shape of the mangled sparring post; this particular half  jutting four foot <i>through</i> the wall and into the hall itself.</p><p>"Aw shit,  Kuno, I'm sorry 'bout that!" the girl floundered, aghast at the  thought that her practice not only escaped the bound of her room, but  nearly hurt somebody in the process. "The guy okay?"</p><p>"Yoshimo  sustained a severe case of fright, but is otherwise unharmed." The  kendoist reassured and Ranma sagged with relief. "If I may  suggest…" Ranma turned her attention from the wrecked wall to  Kuno, who seemed to be rethinking his words. With her eyes on him,  Tatewaki shook his head. "Never mind. Another time, perhaps."</p><p>"What's  that?" Curiosity reigned now that Ranma was sufficiently drained of  anger, and she couldn't help but wonder what topic the normally  overly-bold Kuno would step so lightly around.</p><p>"It's  just…" Tatewaki paused further, picking through his words  carefully. "One can't help but to notice that your… activities…  are becoming more strenuous in nature."</p><p>"Yes…?"  Her voice was leaded with slightest hint of violence should the  outcome of the conversation not agree with her.</p><p>"And while  it is none of my business, I would be remiss if I did not express my  concerns."</p><p>"You're  right." Ranma returned. "It <i>isn't</i> any of your business."</p><p>"Indeed, I  am worried about thy well-being." The boy continued, co-opting the  pigtailed girl's business as his own. "It is obvious that the  pressures of your life are increasing despite the safe harbor I hath  provided."</p><p>The  pigtailed girl shook her head. She wanted to get mad. Very mad.  First, Kuno was sticking his nose where it didn't belong. Second, he  was poking at a very sore wound. Be that as it were, there was a  couple overriding factors preventing her from punting the nosy  kendoist out of his very own house, the primary of which being that  he was, after all, Tatewaki Kuno. After nearly two and a half years  of having known him, it would be like yelling at the rain to stop  being wet. And as much as it pained Ranma to admit it, that very  nature had unwittingly placed him in the role of confidant. She could  vent, scream and otherwise complain about the injustices of life  while Kuno stood there and listened, occasionally interjecting with  his own irrelevant and inadvertently humorous take on reality. And  through it all, he wouldn't gossip, gab or otherwise turn said  conversations to his advantage through manipulation or extortion.</p><p>The fact was  that he was the only one who would listen. Sure there was Akane, but  she was dealing with her own trauma, mostly likely confiding in  Kasumi for her therapy. Telling Nabiki would be like paying to slit  her own wrists while everybody else couldn't be trusted beyond how  fast it would take to marry her off to the highest bidder. No, it was  a sad testament to her life, in Ranma's opinion, that there was only  one person she could trust with her baggage, and that person was a  certified nutcase himself. Maybe she'd get around to punting him  later, but after a week like this week, today wasn't going to be that  day.</p><p>Then again,  she said that last time too.</p><p>"Yeah,  well I can manage." Ranma grumbled, turning her thoughts back to  the topic at hand.</p><p>"Like  the reed in the wind no doubt." Tatewaki nodded sagely. "Though  even the reeds need their respite from the gale."</p><p>Ranma eyed  the Kuno. It never ceased to amaze her that even beneath the layers  of insanity were pearls of insightful wisdom. It was yet another  facet of the upperclassmen she would have never guessed existed, and  their appearance seemed to be becoming more and more frequent. Or  maybe it was just because she was noticing because of their close  association as of late. Either way, it was damn eerie. "Yeah,  that's my life. The freakin' gale of chaos."</p><p>"Like  your art."</p><p>The martial  artist paused, turning her full attention on the kendoist now. The  uncharacteristic depth of his words stalled her angst and  self-loathing abruptly. "Whattdya mean by that?"</p><p>"I wish  not to offend thee, my goddess, as I know your passion for the Art is  second to none," Kuno hastened. "But I have had a chance to  observe your activities as of late and have come to a rather  startling conclusion."</p><p>"Go  on." Ranma knew in her gut she shouldn't encourage the boy, but  watching Kuno have inspiration was like watching a train wreck… She  just couldn't look away.</p><p>"I have  observed the unorthodox tactics employed by yourself and the wretched  Saotome." Kuno began, heedless of disturbing Ranma's ire with  the Saotome descriptive. Whether she just didn't notice it or chose  to ignore it was up for debate, but her silence allowed him to  continue uninterrupted. "Yet I can't help but to wonder if the  very same element that makes your style so formidable is also what is  doing irreparable damage to your very spirit."</p><p>The redhead  began to rub her forehead. She had been duped. It was nothing but  more magical sorcery crap. "Last thing I wanna hear about is  foul sorcery, Kuno."</p><p>Kuno nodded.  "While I agree that his magiks are potent, I am referring to the  art you and my nemesis practice. Its unpredictable nature seems to  foil me at every turn and I am left to wonder if it is not foiling  thee as well."</p><p>Her climb to  irritation was stalled once more as the conversation took an  unexpected twist. Even as she was left to figure out where the  conversation was going, another part of her noted that Kuno seemed to  be getting entirely too good at disarming her hostility toward him.  It was rather annoying, in a way, to find that she just couldn't beat  his head in as freely as she was used to doing.</p><p>"Okay,  so what's yer point?"</p><p>"That  perhaps that unpredictable nature has seeded itself into every aspect  of your life." Tatewaki continued gravely. "You yourself  hath admitted that your life is little more than controlled chaos,  much like the art you practice."</p><p>"I…"  Her mouth opened to release the coherent thought on the tip of her  tongue, but found none present.</p><p>"It is  said that a practitioner and their art are doth inseparable."  The kendoist pressed forward with his reasoning. "Is it but  coincidence that such discord flows in thy wake like a mighty ship  spurning the natural order of things in its passing?"</p><p>Again, she  tried to push the words out of her mouth, but her mind was racing. He  was saying that Anything Goes was actually the <i>cause</i> of all  her problems! True, the Art was her life, but that didn't mean…!</p><p>"Truly,  I have found it such with my own Art. Kendo requires strict  discipline." The boy elaborated. "It is, in fact what has  helped me retain my grip on sanity where my father and sister hath  fallen. Its form helps center me, which in turn, centers my life. If  ones form was unpredictable and purposely chaotic…"</p><p>He let the  implication hang in the air and Ranma's mind snatched at it greedily.  It was an utterly insane conclusion to come to, one worthy of Kuno  himself, but he was right at some level and she knew it. One became  the art they practiced, to a degree. Of course, if that were entirely  the case, the upperclassman in front of her could claim sanity as an  attribute. <i>Not necessarily</i>, another part of her brain  countered. From what she knew of him, he was actually a decent - if  rather eccentric - student in school. She knew from personal  experience he painted reasonably well, and aside from his interaction  with herself and Akane, led a rather chaos free lifestyle. So had the  Tendos, until coming back into contact with her side of the family.  Could it really be…?</p><p>Ranma shook  her head, playing with her pigtail anxiously. "No. That's just…  Look, that can't be right." The level of anxiety grew as the full  implications of his hypothesis became fully realized. "I ain't  givin' up the Art if that's what yer saying! It's the only  thing that I got left in this nightmare of a life!"</p><p>To her  surprise, Tatewaki looked similarly aghast. "My goddess, I would  not think of suggesting such a thing! Nay, I would smite the fiend  who would even suggest removing that measure of your fiery spirit!"</p><p>His reaction  left her speechless and blinking at the upperclassman. All this time,  Ranma had simply assumed that Kuno was looking for some girl to shape  to his own distorted version of reality and her girl-type happened to  be a convenient receptacle to that end. The fact that he wouldn't  change a thing about her came as a shock, especially when nobody else  in her life would afford her such a luxury. Parents. Fiancées.  Even friends. They all wanted her to be something she wasn't. <i>Heh,  even as myself I'm still something I'm not</i>, Ranma thought  bitterly, considering her current form. The irony was positively  sickening. The one person who would accept her for who she was was in  love with a fantasy, like so many other things in Kuno's life. She  paused in her self loathing, sizing up the upperclassman for what  seemed like the first time.</p><p><i>Maybe,  just maybe, I've sold you short, Kuno. </i></p><p>He may have  been in love with a fantasy, but he was practically the only person  in her life that wasn't trying to turn her into something she  wasn't. She wasn't a womanizer. She wasn't a Okanomiyaki chef.  Or a polygamist, for that matter. She wasn't breeding stock or  marriage collateral. At the end of the day, she was simply Ranma  Saotome, heir of her school and nothing more. It was something  Tatewaki had accepted outright, even if he tended to overlook one  crucial detail on a regular basis. Somewhere in the back of Ranma's  mind, a decision was made without her even realizing it. Maybe she  could play along in his circumstantial mutiny against reality, if  never to the extent he would wish, and in turn, accept him for who he  was as well.</p><p>With that  silent dilemma reconciled, Ranma returned to the waiting boy with  slightly more spirit than she had entered the mansion with. "Okay,  if you're not suggesting I quit the art, what are you suggesting?"</p><p>Tatewaki  scritched his chin, making a production of thinking upon the matter.  "Perhaps the methods by which you deal with your adverse  circumstances are ill-suited to the task."</p><p>Once her  mind had opened to the possibility that there might be something of  substance under Kuno's insane substrate, she grasped the direction  of his theory easily enough. If he considered her life and her art  chaos and improvisation, then outlets such as the one she had just  engaged in would be nothing more than heaping turmoil on top of  chaos. She fixed the Tatewaki with her pure blue eyes as those  thoughts came into focus. "I think I see what your getting' at.  Fighting fire with fire ain't necessarily a good idea. Not sure if  accept the entire thing, but I can at least see where you're coming  from."</p><p>"As  intelligent as thou art beautiful." Tatewaki nodded with a  smile, causing Ranma to frown. She really needed to break him of that  habit. "Mayhaps instead of channeling your release through your  art, perhaps something more… <i>structured</i> is required; an  opposite to the tribulations you endure."</p><p>"Like…?"</p><p>Tatewaki  walked across the beaten room and over to an untouched weapons rack,  pulling a wooden sword from it. "Kendo has been invaluable to  myself in a similar capacity. It is an art of form, style and grace,  its movement smooth and precise. Truly it would seem to be the foil  to the chaos of your life and art."</p><p>The redhead  favored her host with a disinterested look. "I already know how  to use a sword."</p><p>"Nay,  my fiery beauty." Kuno returned. "While your proficiency is  beyond question, I have observed that your skills lack any form  whatsoever. For this to work as envisioned, your movements require  structure. Predictability."</p><p>"Predictability  ain't much use in real combat." She countered, and to her mild  surprise, the upperclassman nodded with her statement.</p><p>"It  seems to be thus." He admitted readily. "Such is not the  purpose of our exercise her, however. Outside these walls, you may  use any form you so desire. Inside these walls however, I would ask  of you to follow the strict forms and movements of Kendo, as it is  the only way I can envision countering the chaos of your daily life."</p><p>It made  sense at some level, Ranma realized. Even though she was absolutely  certain she could wipe the walls with the Kendoist, every blade form  she knew had its roots in Anything Goes and by his logic, was  ill-suited to her… therapy. Ranma sighed mentally. Where had things  gone wrong? Where had they gotten so bad that she was actually  contemplating Tatewaki Kuno as her guidance counselor? Okay, so maybe  he wasn't so bad, but he was still a nutcase. <i>Then again, it's not  like I have a better idea.</i> <i>What am I gonna do, pound more  stuff into the ground as things get worse? And they will get worse</i>,  Ranma had no doubt. At this rate, Kuno's mansion, let alone his  servants, wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>Ranma hung her head,  mentally defeated. "Alright, Kuno. What did ya have in mind?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki eyed  Ranma with a measure of disbelief. "You took advice from <i>Kuno?</i>  What were you <i>thinking?</i>" Nabiki rubbed her forehead and  mumbled, "Well, that'd explain why you going girl..."<p>"Heh, not  really." Ranma waved the comment away. "It was everything.  Family. Rivals. Fiancées. You." Nabiki winced at the pointed  reminder. "The constant Akane-snatchers and those run-ins with the  lizard men weren't helping."</p><p>"Tell me  about it." Akane rolled her eyes.</p><p>Nabiki came  to a quick conclusion. "So you retreated. To your girl-type."</p><p>"I... That  is..." Ranma was at a loss for words for the first time since  Nabiki had found out her secret. "Yes." She admitted, sucking in  a deep breath. "Everything is different. Fiancées don't  glomp. Rivals aren't so eager to go after me. Hell, everybody treats  me different. I can eat ice cream."</p><p>The middle  Tendo opened her mouth, then closed it as her thoughts ran into a  mental roadblock. "Wait... Ice cream?"</p><p>"Freedom  from obligations that were never my own." Ranma elaborated. "It's  the only way I see a light at the end-" The redhead paused,  cocking her head. "Damn. Parents are on their way out. 'Kane-chan?"  Akane smiled and pulled a mallet from behind her back. Nabiki blinked  as she looked from one grinning girl to the other.</p><p>"<i>RANMA  NO BAKA!"<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p><b>Author's  Notes;</b><br/><i>If you were expecting me to just jump right into a  Kuno-Ranma-chan sex scene, sorry to disappointed you ;) Still  building plot, so hope like it.
