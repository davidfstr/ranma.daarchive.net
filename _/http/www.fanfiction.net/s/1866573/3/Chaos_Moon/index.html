</div>Chaos Moon<p>By The Eternal Dragon<p>Chapter 3<p>2/20/04<p>AN: I don't own Sailor Moon nor Ranma ½. I could say I did but we all know better, don't we? Also, I'd like to think everyone who reviewed and I'm glad that those of you who are enjoying this story are enjoying it.<p>Maric, thanks for your help on the story and as far as if the NWC will see their mistakes, some will definitely. Kara, I can most certainly say that this isn't going to be a Ranma gets stuck as a girl because I have plans for both sides. Sigtrygg, I hope this chapter answers your question. In truth, I kind of think Ranma would be more worried at this or seeing his mother's disappointment than having to actually commit seppuku. Dogbercarroll, I'm not going to really try to demonize the cast because though before this the story actually followed the cannon pretty closely though a few minor changes I might make here and there. This is an AU or divergence in which I think it can be seen that it would be possible for Ranma to really have a breakdown with all the stuff he goes through day in and day out. DarkBlueHated, hmmmm...it's a very good chance that Ranma is Usagi's brother. And as for Ranma being with a senshi, maybe. If he is though I already know who it's going to be, my favorite senshi. Grandmaster, I haven't looked at Wild Fox's story yet though I intend to and I'll think about changing my stories name though I'm not sure to as what yet.<p>I'd like to thank the reviewers so far: Maric, ranger5, Jason, calamite, Kara, Chi Vayne, Stonebridge, GaelicDragon, Bahamutzero94, mystery person, grandmaster, Jerry Unipeg, DarkBlueHated, TopQuark, dogbertcarroll, taxzombie, and Sigtrygg. If I missed anyone I'm sorry.<p>Ranma woke to Usagi's gentle shaking and was at first confused until reality came crashing down on her. She had let the blonde girl lead her onto a train and to god knows where. Ranma stretched then followed the blonde as she rose and made their way off of the train. Ranma followed Usagi this far so why turn back now? It wasn't like anyone cared back home.<p>"We aren't too far away from my house." Usagi said eliciting a simple nod from Ranma. It wasn't like Ranma was trying to be rude to the blonde but Ranma wasn't sure what to say or what to reveal. The simple truth of the matter was that Ranma was scared.<p>That almost brought a laugh to Ranma, the great Ranma Saotome scared of something. Ranma wasn't scared of anything, well almost nothing, there were those evil little fur balls with the fangs and claws just waiting to attack and steal your soul. Their battle cry was the worse, it may have been a simple "Meow" but it was enough to send shivers down the martial artist's back.<p>Ranma's danger sense kicked in causing to her to grasp Usagi's hand and pull her back just as a red sports car skidded to a halt just a few feet away. Both the driver and passenger doors opened letting out a tall blonde woman who Ranma thought was a man at first and a girl just a little younger than herself with black hair that almost seemed purple.<p>"Usagi!" the blonde asked roughly, "Where have you been? Everyone's been worried sick!"<p>"I'm sorry Haruka," Usagi replied looking down at the ground for a moment then back to the red head, "My new friend needed help and I couldn't just abandon her."<p>A startled gasp from the purple haired girl and a whisper of, "Rayne!" brought Ranma's and everyone else's attention to the youngest girl.<p>"You know her, Hotaru?" Usagi asked.<p>Hotaru shook her head sadly then says, "I'm sorry, she just reminds me of an old friend." The way the girl said old sounded odd to Ranma, almost as if the girl was hinting at something to the others.<p>"Come on Usagi, I'll give you and your friend a ride home." Haruka said, "Your parents are having fits."<p>"Thank you, Haruka." Usagi said with her voice partially filled with dread. Ranma sighed realizing that Usagi was probably going to be in trouble with her parents and it was Ranma's fault. She wasn't sure what time it was but it was dark out which meant it had to be very much later than when Ranma first wound up under the bridge.<p>Ranma followed Usagi into the red sports car and gulped as the other two climbed in, for some reason Ranma was getting very scared. All too soon Ranma figured out why she was so worried when the car pulled off and got moving at speeds that would put most race car drivers to shame.<p>"So what's your name?" Hotaru asked as she looked back from the front seat of the car with a curious smile on her face.<p>Ranma wasn't sure what to do or what to say. If they recognized her name and it got out that she was wherever she was then the trouble back in Nerima would come here and Usagi didn't deserve that kind of problems. She hated to lie to them but what else could Ranma do?<p>"She doesn't speak much." Usagi said taking Ranma's hand, "I'll explain later, okay?"<p>"Alright," Haruka said as the car skidded to a stop, "But I want to know what's going on later, please."<p>Usagi nodded to Haruka as the taller blonde let her and Ranma out, "I promise tomorrow, okay?"<p>"Sure." Haruka said as she climbed back into the car, "Take care, Usagi. You too." Haruka said nodding towards Ranma before pulling away at speeds that left Ranma wondering if the girl even had a license in the first place.<p>Ranma followed an agitated Usagi up to the house they was at nervously. Maybe this was a bad idea, Usagi was already in enough trouble as it was because of Ranma. She was thinking about turning away and just leaving when the door was yanked open and a woman with blue hair erupted from inside to gather Usagi up into what looked like a very painful bear hug and yet what looked like a loving embrace all in one. It was all too easy to see the worry in the woman's face.<p>"Where have you been?" the woman demanded as she pushed Usagi at arms length and looked into Usagi's eyes.<p>"I'm sorry mom," Usagi said as she reached back for Ranma's hand who allowed the blonde to pull her forward next to each other as Usagi's mom looked her over to. "Can we please go inside and talk? We need to talk to dad too."<p>"Your father and brother are out looking for you." Usagi's mom said as she pulled the two girls into the house and closed the door. Ranma quietly followed the two into the house and into the dinning room and took a chair next to Usagi at the table as the woman went into the kitchen and came back with a tray of cookies and milk and sat them down on the table and sat down across from the two girls. Neither girl took any of the proffered treats which Ranma could see worry as the woman started at Usagi in disbelief.<p>"Mom," Usagi said as she obviously tried to figure out what to say or where to start. "I found a new friend today."<p>"I can see that," Usagi's mom said looking over at Ranma. Ranma could see the worry in the woman's face, she had to know something was wrong. She seemed to care for Usagi a great deal and Ranma wasn't positive but was pretty sure that normally a mother would be upset if her daughter had stayed out late like this not talking calmly like this.<p>Usagi looked down at the table as if examining something interesting before saying, "She was trying to kill herself."<p>"WHAT?" Usagi's mom cried out, "Why on earth would you do something like that?"<p>Usagi didn't say anything and when Ranma looked up into the woman's eyes she found the same expression Usagi wore earlier, the woman seemed worried about Ranma, but why? It became hard for Ranma to look into the woman's eyes and had to divert her gaze before she started crying.<p>"I'm just tired of living," Ranma whispered, "I'm sick of all of it."<p>Ranma felt someone wrap their arms around her and looked up to see Usagi's mom had moved over next to her and was hugging her. The woman kissed the top of Ranma's head and brushed back her bangs.<p>"It helps to talk about it you know." The woman said soothingly.<p>"What's there to talk about?" Ranma asked as she let the woman hold her. First Usagi and now this woman, two complete strangers and yet two people who truly did seem to care for Ranma. In a way it was hard to believe but Ranma found herself starting to open up a little bit.<p>"Like why you feel this way dear." The woman said, her voice soft and supportive.<p>"We only want to help." Usagi said, putting her hand on Ranma's shoulder, "Maybe you would like to talk a little more about your parents?"<p>Ranma sighed as she shook her head, she really didn't want to talk about them but she didn't know what else to do and the two that was there with her really did only seem concerned. "My pops, he took me away when I was little on a training trip. My whole life he either treated me like crap in the name of the art or sell me to other families to marry but ran away with their dowries."<p>"How about your mother?" Usagi asked.<p>"I've only seen her a few times and I have to hide from her every time." Ranma said fighting back tears.<p>"Why?" Usagi's mother asked slowly.<p>"Before pops took me away I guess we signed a seppuku contract that we would commit seppuku if I didn't turn out to what she wanted." Ranma said as her voice came close to breaking, she felt the woman stiffen momentarily. "I don't care about killing myself but I don't want to see the disgust on her face when she sees what kind of freak I am."<p>"Freak?" Usagi asked, "You aren't a freak."<p>"That's not what everyone else says." Ranma said, tears starting to break free. "Pervert, freak, worthless, that's what they say and they're right. I'm nothing but a worthless freak who deserves to die!"<p>"You are not any of those things and you don't deserve to die." The woman said.<p>"MEATBALL HEAD!" came a cry as a little girl bounded into the room who had pink hair done up a lot like Usagi's. Ranma cringed as he saw the girl stumble and let go of a mug which came flying directly at Ranma flinging hot chocolate all over her turning her into him.<p>Both Usagi and her mother jumped back in surprise and stared at Ranma in shock and surprise. "W-what are you?" Usagi stammered out.<p>Ranma drew his legs up to him and buried his face into his knees, "A freak." He said as he shook with a sob and then another. Usagi and her mother quickly went back to Ranma and hugged him.<p>"You are not a freak, dear." Usagi's mother said.<p>"You're just special." Usagi said.<p>"Yeah, a special freak." Ranma laughed bitterly as the two woman tried to comfort him as a pink haired girl looked on in shock. The others missed what the girl said but Ranma heard it faintly and was shocked, "Auntie?"
