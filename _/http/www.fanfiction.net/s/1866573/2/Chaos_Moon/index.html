</div>Chaos Moon By The Eternal Dragon<p>Chapter 2 5/19/04<p>AN: This is a cross over of Ranma ½ and Sailor Moon which I own neither. It's only a fanfiction and I don't intend to make any money off of it. (As if I could.) Thanks to all of you who have reviewed.<p>The thunder and rain had fit Ranma's mood perfectly as he, presently she, slid the knife she had softly over her exposed wrist. For the first time in a long time she wasn't wearing her bracers as she wasn't expecting to have to fight anyone, or more exactly didn't care. The absence of the bracers wasn't the only thing though, she was crying as she remembered all the pain and abuse her so called family and friends put her through.<p>A small smile played across her lips as a thin line of red welled in the wake of the blade. She didn't press down to hard though so there wasn't too much blood, not yet. She was tired of all the abuse and was going to end it, the last little bit of pain that she would have to feel as she gripped the knife harder and was readying for another pass, a stronger and deeper slash, no more games.<p>Something in the back of her mind whispered that this is what she ultimately deserved, that she deserved the pain she was a freak that trouble always seemed to follow. Maybe everyone had a right to be upset with her but did they really have to treat her as bad as they did? Ranma stopped for a moment, maybe if she tried again, talk to them more, maybe they would stop treating her so bad.<p>She shook as a sob escaped past her lips, they weren't going to stop. This was the only way to stop it, stop the pain. She started to raise the knife again when a voice called out to her. She wasn't sure what they said but turned around to see a blonde girl with long twin ponytails moving towards her.<p>The girl gasped and stepped away from Ranma quickly leaving her to wonder if it was getting easier for others to see how pathetic she was.<p>"L-Leave me a-alone!" Ranma tried to snap but her voice was hoarse from all the crying making it a little hard to sound too threatening.<p>She had the shock of her life as the blonde got a look of determination in her blue eyes as she stormed over to Ranma snatching the knife and throwing it into the water all in one motion. She was too stunned to do anything when the blonde kneeled down and took her arm to look at the cut.<p>"What the hell do you think your doing?" the blonde demanded.<p>Ranma was finally getting a little control back over herself and her emotions, and snapped at the blonde girl, ""It's none of your damned business meatball head!" Ranma roughly pulled her arm away from the other girl, "Why don't you go home and play with your dollies?"<p>The blonde girl rose back up and took a step back and looked back at Ranma with what looked like anger in her eyes, after all Ranma had seen it enough to know it. What she couldn't figure out was what the other emotion was, it looked a little like concern maybe but why would a stranger be concerned when no one else in Ranma's life was.<p>"I'm sure as heck not going to stand here and let you kill yourself!" the blonde declared.<p>Ranma rose from where she was sitting and glared at the blonde, anger filling her temporarily replacing the depression. "Why should you care?" Ranma demanded, then whispered, "It's not like anyone else does."<p>"Surely it can't be all that bad..." the blonde said reaching out towards Ranma. Ranma backed away from the girl dodging away from the porfered hand.<p>"It's not that bad? Nobody gives a DAMN about how I feel. NOBODY!" Ranma snarled as the depression was returning with even more force than before. It was getting harder and harder to fight back the tears that was threatening to spill.<p>"I'm sure someone does." The blonde whispered.<p>"Sure, my dad uses me to feed his fat stomach when he's not abusing me for the sake of the art. I have to hide from my own mother or else she'll kill me. I'm engaged to more girl's than I know what to do with and none of them care what I want, hell no that would be too much to ask. I'm just some damned prize to them. I have no friends, everyone either wants me dead or as a plaything!" Ranma says as each word brings her closer and closer to her losing control. She slowly made her way to be standing almost face to face with the blonde girl, "So tell me, who the hell cares for a FREAK like me? NOONE, that's who! So why the HELL not kill myself?"<p>Ranma stared into the girl's eyes for several moments, silently praying for the girl to leave. The girl didn't though, the girl's actions completely shocked Ranma as the blonde embraced Ranma. She couldn't hold it back any longer as the damns burst and the tears came. At first Ranma tried to get away but the blonde wouldn't let go. Ranma soon gave up and just settled for crying, it didn't matter anymore. She let the blonde guide them to the ground as Ranma cried in the girl's arms, letting the embrace give some comfort.<p>Usagi gently brushed the red haired girl's hair as she settled down, it was getting late and her parents was going to be worried. She couldn't leave the emotional girl here alone though and there was no way that Usagi was going to let the other girl go back to whatever hell that she had come from.<p>The hospital might be the best bet but what if the girl's family showed up, would they let them take her back? The police might have been the best bet but if the girl was this bad then what ever was happening had to been going on for some time which may of meant that the local police may be involved with the girl's family and if that was so then the would probably just let them take the girl back.<p>Usagi mentally sighed trying to think of some way to help the distraught girl but right now Usagi needed to call home to let her parents know that she was going to be late. Her parents, Usagi wanted to bang her head on something, her parents could help the girl because her father was a lawyer and had all kinds of connections. Ami's mom could provide any medical help the girl might need.<p>"I have to go home," Usagi said softly to the redhead as she slowly got up while helping the red head up. It seemed the redhead was just following what ever directions that Usagi gave. "If you come with me I can get you some help."<p>Usagi took the red haired girl's hand and gently led the girl towards the train station relieved that the girl was following. The two quickly made it to the station and Usagi was relieved that they was just in time to catch the next one to Juuban. After paying for the tickets Usagi led the two onto the train and to a quiet section where the two could sit together and hopefully talk without others listening in.<p>Usagi wasn't too sure where to begin as she looked next to the redhead sitting next to the window as the train lurched forward suddenly as it started on it's way. Again Usagi wanted to bang her head against something as she realized that she hadn't even introduced herself.<p>"My names Usagi Tsukino." Usagi said, frowning slightly when she didn't get a response from the redhead. "What's your name?"<p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Usagi asked again and still got no response. She kept asking questions trying to get the redhead to answer one of them, to get some sort of response. "What's your hobbies? What kind of foods do you like? What do you like to do?"<p>Usagi sighed and leaned back in her seat wishing that she waould get some kind of response, she was beginning to get worried about the redhead.<p>"Why?" the redhead asked causing Usagi to jump slightly.<p>"Huh?" was Usagi's intelligent reply.<p>"Why are you trying to help me?" the redhead asked, "I'm not worth it."<p>She's not worth it? Usagi couldn't believe she heard that. Something about the redhead tugged at Usagi, threatening to pull forth memories but everytime she thought she had it the memory eluded her. The redhead acting like this though seemed wrong to Usagi somehow, something wanted to make Usagi think that the redhead should be very proud and strong, top of the world not the scared, hurt girl next to her. Usagi knew that for the girl to be acting the way she was, it had to have been a lot that happened to her.<p>"You are worth it." Usagi finally said, reaching an arm around the girl to pull her close. The redhaired girl rested her head against Usagi and snuggled into the the blonde, quickly falling asleep.<p>Usagi shook her head unable to believe that anyone would hurt someone as bad as the redhead was hurt but knew that there was. The redhead had called herself a freak for some unknown reason but in Usagi's opinion it was the people that had hurt the redhead that were the true freaks. They were monsters that was even worse that the ones that the senshi fought against.
