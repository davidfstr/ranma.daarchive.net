Akane held Ranma as he slumped forward, knocked out cold.</p><p>"UKYO!" Akane exclaimed in rage.</p><p>The youngest of the three Tendo sisters was already not in a very good mood. Everyone it seems was getting in the way of her and Ranma trying to have a semblance of a normal life together. First it was the Baka Brigade, Mousse, Ryoga, and Kuno. Next it was half of the entire male population of Furinken High School, and now it was 'her'. Akane never considered Ukyo a real threat. She would never actually try to kill anyone though she had the opportunity many times to get rid of Akane. The okonomiyaki chef did not have it in her. Despite the fact that her anger got away with her a few times. That was the reason why Akane was not blasting her to atoms at that moment. She wanted to see what the chef would do next.</p><p>She was surprised when Ukyo fell to her knees and started crying, "Why, why did you choose her and not me? I'm your cute iinazuke, not 'her'! Why Ranchan, why?"</p><p>Akane felt Ranma stir in her arms, and a few seconds later he was up on his own rubbing the huge bump growing on his head. "Oh my head." he groaned.</p><p>"Ukyo." Akane sighed sadly as she looked down at the weeping girl. Ranma's eyes became a little more focused and the bump on his head started to fade away. He stood up all the way and turned around to look at his long time childhood friend and onetime iinazuke. There was no way he could feel angry at her, she still should not have hit him like that, but he was sad for her. Sad because her dreams of being his bride were gone, sad because he had to break her heart and did not tell her before hand that he had chosen Akane, and sad that he may have lost his childhood friend.</p><p>"Ucchan, listen-" he started to say when Ukyo leapt to her feet and raised her Baker's Peel. Ranma did not move, he just stood there and looked at her as she looked back at him with tears streaking down her face. I wish there had been another way, I should have told her, but at the time we couldn't risk letting the Amazons know., he told himself.</p><p>"I don't want to hear it!" she cried with a look of absolute anguish on her face.</p><p>"Just listen to him." Akane told her in as calm and compelling a voice as she could muster.</p><p>"Listen to what, listen to him say I'm sorry Ukyo for choosing 'you' over me because of that stupid promise to join the schools when he was engaged to 'me' first!" the chef snapped back at her with anger flashing in her eyes aimed right at the young Tendo.</p><p>"Don't get mad at Akane or me! It was pop who made this mess by stealing your dad's yatai! Besides, we didn't get married cause of the promise between our dads, I asked her to marry me." Ranma shouted back at her, but calmed down when spoke the last sentence. It would do no good to loose his temper with Ukyo, it would just drive her away out of his life even further than she was now. He did not love her the way she wanted him to, but he still did love her as a friend.</p><p>"You p-p-proposed to 'her'?" she repeated not quiet believing what she was hearing and pointed a finger at Akane. The three did not notice yet the crowd of students that had gathered around them. Nabiki stood among them with her subordinates. She was fuming. This was that bitch Masuka's doing. There was going to be hell to pay.</p><p>Akane looked around, noticed the audience they had and said, "Maybe we should take this somewhere else." Ranma nodded, reached out at lightning speed and grabbed Ukyo's hand.</p><p>"Let me go!" she shouted at him.</p><p>"Just hold on a sec." Ranma told her in a tone he hoped would calm her down, then he took Akane's hand with his other hand. A second later, the three of them vanished instantly with a popping sound as the air rushed in to occupy the space they had been standing in.</p><p>"WHOA!" came a cry of shock and surprise from the students watching.</p><p>The three appeared on the roof of Furinken High with a sound that was like a thud as the air around them was suddenly displaced. Ukyo, who had been struggling to get free of Ranma's hand, stopped in her tracks and looked around in shock and surprise. Wasn't I just in the hallway near the shoe lockers?, she asked herself. She looked around and sure enough was on the roof of the school. Ukyo for the life of her could not remember leaving the building.</p><p>"Ucchan, please, I didn't wanna hurt your feelings or anything. We couldn't let anyone outside the family know because of Cologne and the Kunos." Ranma said in a pleading tone.</p><p>She wrenched her arm free of his grasp and shouted, "Is that supposed to make me feel better!"</p><p>"No." he replied sincerely.</p><p>"Ukyo, we should have told you earlier. We didn't expect anything like this to happen and for you to find out this way." Akane told her sympathetically.</p><p>The chef turned away from the couple angrily. "You're damn right you should have told me instead of me hearing it from people gossiping in class."</p><p>"Just tell me this, are you two really in love?" she looked back at them and asked.</p><p>There was only one answer Ranma could give her. "Yeah, actually we've been in love for a long time, but we just couldn't admit it to each other until now."</p><p>Ukyo wiped the tears from her eyes before turning back to look at them. Akane was showing no signs of her old behavior anymore. She was actually standing a bit between her and Ranma as if she were trying to be protective over him. They were standing close together. His arm was around Akane's waist and she was not belting him one.</p><p>"What made you guys changed your minds about each other?" she asked them, she figured she had a right to know why her future was now destroyed bitterly.</p><p>The couple looked at one another for a moment, a silent message seemed to cross between them then Akane spoke. "You don't know, that's right, you didn't know about Herb." she said.</p><p>"Herb?" Ukyo said questioningly. She never heard that name before.</p><p>"A few months ago these guys from China came to the Nekohauten. They were from the Musk Dynasty or something like that. They took wives who were animals they fought and were changed into girls at Josenkyo so their kids would have the powers of animals or something like that." Ranma explained to her. "Herb was a prince of their people. They had this ladle that could lock people in their cursed forms, he locked me after he tried to hurt Akane, then me, Ryoga, and Mousse when after him. He was looking for a kettle that could undo the lock cause he was locked in his cursed for too."</p><p>"Do you remember hearing about a mountain collapsing a few months ago?" Akane asked Ukyo. The chef nodded, she did hear about that happening. It was close to her family's ancestral home. "That happened because of the fight between Herb and Ranma."</p><p>Ranma brought down a mountain while fighting somebody? It was that intense a fight? "He was missing for a few weeks and I saw so scared that I'd never see him again." Akane went on. "When he finally came home I couldn't hold it in anymore and I told him how I really felt."</p><p>"I didn't even know any of this had happened." Ukyo said in stunned surprise. No wonder they got so close so fast., she told herself.</p><p>"The other day Kuno, Mousse and Ryoga tried to kill Ranma." Akane told her. Ukyo looked up at her, a wave of rage crossed the chef's face. She was going to personally make the lives of three baka very miserable.</p><p>"And you know what happened this morning. It was caused by this girl who's been competing with Nabiki." Ranma explained.</p><p>Ukyo sighed and looked away. "I know her, Ikari Masuka. She thinks her shit don't stink and loves to remind you of that every chance she gets."</p><p>She felt a gentle hand on her shoulder and looked up into Ranma's soft blue eyes. Ukyo could get lost in those beautiful blue orbs. "Ucchan, please don't hate me. I should have handled this better, Akane and I should have told you what was happening, but we didn't wanna take the chance of the Kunos or the Amazons finding out." he told her in a pleading voice.</p><p>"Why don't you love me Ranchan, why?" she asked, tears started to fall down her face again. Her shoulders start to shake as sobs wracked her body.</p><p>"I do, but not like that. Ucchan we're been friends for a long time. I care about you, but I just could never think of you that way. I'm sorry." he admitted to her. She fell towards him and Ranma wrapped her up in his arms and held her as she cried. Akane said nothing and did not make a move to separate them. Ranma waited until Ukyo was finished before letting her go, but he kept his hands gently on her shoulders.</p><p>"Can we still be friends, please?" he pleaded with her softly. She nodded as she wiped her eyes. Akane took a tissue out of the little purse she carried and handed it to her.</p><p>"Thanks sugar." Ukyo said as she took it and wiped her eyes.</p><p>"Can I ask a question?" she asked the two of them.</p><p>"Sure." the couple replied in unison.</p><p>"How did we suddenly get up on the roof of the school?"</p><p>School was all but forgotten. The three did not want to be anywhere near Furinken High at the moment so the decision to ditch class for a day was not a hard one to make. The next few hours were the most astonishing moments in Ukyo's entire life. She watched as Akane and Ranma performed some of the most amazing tricks she had ever seen. At first she wondered if Ranma had finally started teaching Akane seriously, but some of the things she was doing were impossible to do using just martial arts. They were sitting at the edge of the canal that ran through the area separating Nerima from Furinken.</p><p>Ukyo watched in fascination as Akane made spheres of water rise out of the canal and fly around he head. Ranma stepped into and through the concrete footings holding up the train bridge that ran over canal without breaking them apart. Akane picked up an old can and it reshaped itself into the form of an origami bird right before her eyes. Ranma did other things like walking on the surface of the water without his feet getting wet and making sculptures made of water appear on the surface of the canal.</p><p>"H-H-How are you guys doing all that stuff?" Ukyo finally asked when the two were done and took a bow.</p><p>"Its kinda complicated. Ya gotta be born with the ability, but I gotta tell ya this we ain't what we used to be no more because of it." Ranma explained.</p><p>"An Amazon named Ambrosia is teaching us how to control these abilities we have. She has these powers too and she calls it Weaving." Akane added.</p><p>Ukyo's head tilted to the side and she said, "Weaving?"</p><p>"The best way to describe it is this, the building blocks of space and time are held together by a power that acts like a glue. There are people like me and Ranma who have the power to make this power do things, and thus in making it do things we can changed reality." Akane explained.</p><p>"That's the short version." Ranma added quickly.</p><p>"Ah my Kami-sama." Ukyo breathed, almost too stunned for words.</p><p>"Akane had these powers first, mine didn't wake up until those three blockheads tried to bump me off yesterday." Ranma explained to her.</p><p>He looked down at the ground and said, "Actually, it happened when Kuno tried to rape me when I was in my girl form."</p><p>Ukyo jumped her to feet and screamed, "HE TRIED TO DO WHAT!" Akane rushed to her side. The chef was breathing heavily with a murderous look in her eyes, baker's peel ready to flatten a certain wannabe samurai.</p><p>"Its ok, he won't be bothering us again for a while if ever again." Akane told her trying to calm the enraged girl down.</p><p>"I knew that baka was deranged but I never thought he would try to rape somebody." Ukyo said after calming herself down and sitting back down. The thought of Kuno with his hands all over her body made the girl's flesh crawl. It say a lot about his personality, if he could do that to Ranma he could do that to anyone. Ukyo suddenly realized that the boy was much more dangerous than she had suspected.</p><p>"That toad Sasuke got me with a paralysis dart, that's how Kuno was able to get me in that position without me belting him one." said Ranma with a shiver of revulsion ran down his back as he remembered the feeling of the man's lips and hands on his/her body.</p><p>She looked up at him with a expression of sympathy. "You poor thing. He didn't get too far did he, sugar?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "All he got to do was feel me up and-ugh-man just thinking about it makes me wanna puke." He quickly turned to the canal and started making retching noises.</p><p>"I'd feel the same way." she replied watching him sadly.</p><p>"Kuno and all the others can't hurt us anymore. Not Cologne, not Mousse, and definitely not Ryoga. The little hentai pig." Akane said. When she spoke Ryoga's name she spat and shivered with revulsion.</p><p>"So you know he's P-Chan, huh?" Ukyo said with a smirk.</p><p>Akane replied, "Did everyone know about this except for me? I haven't ran into a single person who didn't know expect for Yuka and Sayuri."</p><p>"Its against the Bushido code to reveal someone's weaknesses to another." Ukyo told her with a shrug of her shoulders.</p><p>"So Ranma tells me." Akane replied eying her husband who was washing his face in the canal making sure not to use too much to trigger his change.</p><p>"Hey, sugar, you said an Amazon was teaching you but Cologne wasn't a problem anymore. What happened besides you two turning into superheros?" Ukyo asked her.</p><p>Ranma walked over and laughed, "We ain't superheros." Although he had to admit Akane would look very good in tights. The thought made his heart skip a beat for a second, it looked like they were not going to get any sleep tonight, again. Of course, Akane would not mind in the least. After they married the girl took to love making like a fish to water.</p><p>"Shampoo tried to make Ranma hers by using a magical comb that would make him do what she told him to do. She tried to make Ranma strangle me, but he fought its control." Akane explained to a wide eyed Ukyo.</p><p>"Oh shit. There's a lot more to all of this that happened than I thought." she said. She turned to Ranma and asked, "What's this I hear about Shampoo living at the Tendo place. Rumors this morning said she was your mistress or something."</p><p>Ranma put his face in his hands and shook his head. "That damn Masuka. I adopted Shampoo as my sister cause Cologne said she'd probably face execution by her people for not winning me as her husband, so I convinced the old ghoul to banish her to Japan and tell her people Shampoo died in battle against me."</p><p>Ukyo's expression softened. "You were always a big softy for us girls."</p><p>"The last major problem now is Kodachi. She's gonna know by now me and Akane tied the knot." he said with some dread in his voice.</p><p>"She won't be a problem." Akane reassured him.</p><p>Sasuke, the loyal retainer of the Kuno clan and sort-of ninja warrior, nearly fell from his perch on the roof of the main building when a piercing scream echoed from below and cross the entire estate. He caught himself before he went over the side and looked down to see one of his charges, Kodachi, run out into the middle of the yard in he leotard. She screamed in righteous fury as her ribbon flashed destroying nearly every stone and concrete ornament in the yard.</p><p>"Mistress Kuno, please stop!" Sasuke pleaded when he leapt down and stood in front of the enraged gymnast.</p><p>"I will not stand for it! My beloved Ranma forced to marry that dreadful Tendo girl, I cannot allow this to continue!" she screamed in fury.</p><p>Sasuke's eyebrow did a Spock Maneuver. "Miss. Tendo and Saotome Ranma have married?" It was the first time he had heard about it. When did that happen? After the battle the other day he did not stick around to hear all that was said. The sight of a glowing Ranma making tree roots do her bidding had been way too frightening for the little ninja.</p><p>"Ranma my darling, I swear on my name as a Kuno that I shall free thee from the clutches of that vile Tendo Akane!" Kodachi cried towards the heavens.</p><p>The day was still early, Ukyo had no desire to go back home for a while, she knew Konatsu could easily handle the shop now without much problem. The three of them, herself, Ranma and Akane arrived at the Tendo dojo. They all knew they were likely going to hear it from the fathers about skipping out on school, but they really did not care at the moment. Besides, Genma would have a great deal more to worry about soon enough.</p><p>CLANG!</p><p>The sound of steel hitting a hollow, brainless Panda over the head echoed throughout the Tendo home. Ukyo stood over the semi-unconscious Panda-Man and just smiled at her handiwork. She looked up at Ranma and Akane who only flashed her smiles of approval.</p><p>"You big furry jackass, you've made my life hell for the past ten years!" Ukyo yelled after Ranma's transformed father started waking up from his sudden forced nap ala Baker's Peel.</p><p>"Growf?" was the only thing the Panda said, he did not hold up any signs.</p><p>"Where is my father's Yatai!" she demanded.</p><p>"Oh my, that must be so long ago it is likely he cannot remember." Kasumi, who was coming out of the kitchen to see what the noise was all about, said with a rather slightly broader smile on her face. Ranma and Akane had finally given their parents that they wanted by getting married, but she herself believed the fathers went too far sometimes in their pursuit to get them together. It was about time someone else besides Ranma was on the receiving end of a weapon for once around her home. Kasumi gave her younger sister a wink and went back into the kitchen.</p><p>"I don't know where it is? What is this all about?" read the hastily written sign in the Panda's paws.</p><p>Ukyo raised her baker's peel threateningly. "Its about you getting Ranma and Akane married behind my back even though you knew my claim is made equally as valid as the agreement to join the schools because you stole my dowry!"</p><p>"It was a matter of family honor, you must understand Ms. Kuonji." Tendo Soun spoke up quickly.</p><p>"SO, ITS THE SAME THING WITH ME!" Ukyo yelled at him. The normally stoic looking man suddenly broke out in a shower of tears.</p><p>"Ya know, Ucchan, you're father said either you have to marry me or you gotta get revenge against me and Pop." Ranma said speaking up.</p><p>"But you're innocent Ranchan, you didn't even know I was a girl and your Pops here didn't even tell you about the engagement until years later. So, the only one I gotta get revenge on is the flea bag." she replied turning a menacing eye towards the panda.</p><p>"Ranma, don't just stand there help your father!" the panda's sign read as he shook it at Ranma urgently.</p><p>Ranma just smiled at him. "Hey, Pops, don't ya always tell me you gotta be a man and fess up to what ya did? Well, its time to practice what ya preach."</p><p>"Stand still and take your medicine baka!" Ukyo growled as she swung to clock the panda over the head again, but this time he dodged to the side and her weapon smashed into the tami mat on the floor. On all fours the panda ran out into the yard as a black and white blur. Ukyo growled, flashed her friends a smile, and made chase.</p><p>"Ranma, how could you betray your father like that!" Soun demanded.</p><p>"Easy, he's done it to me more times than I can count." he replied.</p><p>"Aiya, why Spa...uh...Ukyo chasing father around yard with spatula?" Shampoo asked from the kitchen door.</p><p>Ranma smiled at his sister. "Oh, she's just collecting on an old debt, with interest of course."</p><p>"That sounds like something I'd say." said Nabiki as she walked into the house from the front door.</p><p>"Why are you home so early?" Ranma asked her.</p><p>With a very serious look on her face Nabiki went over to the television and turned it on. "I'm surprised you two didn't find out already." she said as she turned it on and changed to the right channel. A chilling scene of the high school in flames surrounded by fire crews and armed police officers appear. A reporter, a very frightened young woman, walked into the scene with her microphone.</p><p>"This is the scene at Furinken High School in the Furinken Financial District of Tokyo. As you can see, it is pandemonium at the moment as fire crews try to put out the flames. Witnesses on the scene claim to have seen what could only be described as oni. I am told that there are still students inside the building. Fire crews and rescue workers are coming from all over Tokyo in an effort to save them. A large number of reports of people seeing these strange oni prompted the police to respond to the scene as well. So far there have been...OH MY KAMI-SAMA!" the reported said then screamed as a portion of the school building wall exploded outwards revealing something inside. It clawed it way out of the building trailing tentacles. Ranma and Akane easily recognized what it was, and it made the two of them suddenly pale. A second one just like it came out of the hole right after the first. Gunfire rang out on the television speakers as the cameraman ran closer to getting a better look at the scene.</p><p>"W...W...What are those things?" Soun asked.</p><p>"Those are Darklings." said Akane.</p><p>"Oh my, you mean like that monster you fought sometime ago?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Come on Akane, those cops'll get creamed by those things if we don't get there!" Ranma exclaimed as he headed for the door.</p><p>"Why didn't we sense them?" Akane asked as she raced after him.</p><p>Lady Ambrosia was suddenly next to them easily keeping pace with them. "Because, these are Ancients, Darklings that are thousands of years old and have developed techniques to shield their presence from those like us who can detect them." she explained.</p><p>"Oh great, now they sneak up on us." Ranma growled with annoyance.</p><p>"Only until they get within a certain range, and until you eventually develop your own countermeasures to their stealth technique." Ambrosia replied.</p><p>The sound of police sirens could be heard in the distance as they neared the school. When they ran out of the house the column of black smoke rising into the sky was unmistakable. The roar of heavy helicopters passed overhead. Akane looked up and recognized the red, white, and blue flag pattern on the aircraft which she guessed were United States Marines transport helicopters from the American naval base near Tokyo.</p><p>"The local authorities must have called in assistance via the Household Agency for the Americans to get involved in this." said Ambrosia as the school came into view, or at least what was left of it.</p><p>"None of them will live through this if we don't get there!" Akane yelled as she poured on the speed focusing a portion of her power to enhance her speed. The other two did the same thing, Ambrosia whom was an ancient Weaver, and Ranma whom was just learning. They reached the school which was now a battlefield as marines and police opened up with semi and full auto weapons on the two Darklings to no avail. Bodies littered the ground, they were police and soldiers felled by the two monsters. Armed men in the garb of the Home Defense Force also arrived to add assistance, but it was obvious that nothing was stopping the two creatures. The three Weavers, one master, and two students, leapt up and over the gathered fighters and threw themselves at the two Darklings. Gunfire ceased as the men watched the three sail overhead, all three began to glow brightly as drew upon their powers for a massive first strike. A blinding flash of light blinded everyone on the scene as the three unleashed their fury. When the light faded and their vision cleared the police, marines, and Home Defense Force soldiers realized that the battle before them was of a class that was far beyond their capabilities. There was little they could really do at the moment as semi-translucent shield suddenly popped up into existence between them and the monsters.</p><p>Ranma, Akane, and Lady Ambrosia squared off against the Darklings whom were now at the bottom of a huge crater their initial blast bug out of the earth. Where the police, soldiers, and Marines failed to even phase these things the older woman and two teenagers seemed to be not only holding their own but were actually winning.</p><p>"What do we do, Lieutenant?" a Marine asked his superior as they watched the battle helplessly.</p><p>"I don't know, we poured enough lead into those things to kill a hundred bull elephants. I don't know who or what those three people are but I'm glad they're on our side." the ranking Marine replied.</p><p>"I am afraid it is worse. We just received a report of three more of these creatures in the Juuban district." said a Police Sargent.</p><p>"God help us." said the Marine as he turned back to the unbelievable battle playing out before him.</p><p><b>To be continued...</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Coming up in Chapter Six</b></p><p>It has begun. A group of Darklings arrive in Japan and begin cutting a swath of destruction across the land. Only Ranma and Akane can stand against them, but when all seems almost lost an unexpected ally arrive to help even the odds. Part 1 of the "<b>The Visitor</b>" side story to "<b>The Dark Lord of Jurai 2</b>", which is coming soon.</p>
