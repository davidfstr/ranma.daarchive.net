This is part 1 of 4.)</p><p>Somewhere far far away in another universe...</p><p>"Carl Sagan, Carl Sagan, this is the Kamadake II, please respond."</p><p>"Terran vessel Carl Sagan, I repeat again, this is the Galaxy Police vessel Kamadake II responding to your distress signal, please respond."</p><p>It had originally begun as a standard search and rescue operation for the crew of the highly celebrated Kamadake II. They were the finest vessel in the Galaxy Police fleet, and one of the most highly decorated crews in the history of the organization. The lost vessel was of very high profile, an item of great political importance. The Carl Sagan was Earth's first Faster-Than-Light starship, a masterpiece of Terran engineering coupled with alien FTL technology provided graciously by Professor Washu Quintarin director of the Juraian Academy of Advanced Sciences and chief scientific adviser to Emperor Masaki Tenchi. The vessel played an important role in Terran politics and scientific development. It was only ten years old, constructed two years following the incident at Tokyo Tower and the subsequent induction of Earth into the Galactic Union. The Carl Sagan's crew were made up of the finest and brightest of Earth's astrophysicists, astronomers, engineers, botanists, xenobiologists, geologists, and others from dozens of other fields of advanced sciences.</p><p>The ship did not look like a typical vessel to the eyes of Yamada Kiriko or her crew mate/co-wives. The Carl Sagan was built using Human philosophy that in space a ship did not need to be streamlined. The research vessel was blocky, a quarter mile long mass of metal framework housing pressurized modules connected via access tubes. The ship looked primitive to her eyes compared to a ship like the Kamadake II, but then again the Carl Sagan was not designed for combat. It was unarmed save for the external cutting lasers used for taking core samples from asteroids.  It had no armor, the vessel was basically a bunch of canister like compartments held together by a metal framework similar to the Terran's International Space Station. The ship did have shields, one of several non-Terran technological innovations the vessel carried.  The FTL drive was one of the new models similar to the one inside the Kamadake II. Sub-light propulsion came from four big ion thrusters.  Basically the same as the ion thruster of the experimental Deep Space One probe launched by NASA, these models could accelerate the ship a hundred times faster than that early model eliminating the need for traditional rocket engines altogether. It took weeks for Deep Space One to reach top speed with its ion thruster which gently accelerated the tiny vessel, but the engines of the Carl Sagan were of the same class found on other ships throughout the Galactic Union.</p><p>"Carl Sagan, this is the Kamadake II responding to your distress call, please respond."</p><p>"Ne-chan, you've been at that for an hour. They would have responded by now if they heard us." said Yamada Amane from her console on the bridge.</p><p>Yamada Karen, formerly one of the Seto Scouts who constantly seduced Seina during his trips to Jurai, examined the data on her console. "They should be able to hear us now. We're close enough that our transmissions can cut through the interference from the nebula."</p><p>Yamada Baruta Ryoko looked at her holographic display of the Carl Sagan and shivered. Of all the places the missing Terran science vessel could have ended up it had to be the most dangerous region in all of known space. The Dead Zone. A void of unstable space littered with thousands of black holes, nebulae, temporal anomaly, and only Tsunami-sama knew what else. As a former space pirate she knew most of this place like the back of her hand. Many times her ship hid within the Dead Zone to escape the Galaxy Police or rival pirate clans. She could literally fly the route to the infamous hidden pirate city with her eyes closed. Her familiarity with the Dead Zone is what made her nervous right now. The Carl Sagan sat on the back door of four of the largest quantum singularities ever recorded by science; Terran and extraterrestrial. As a consequence, the nebula they sat in often experienced some of the most violent cosmic storms ever recorded.  One of those storms, one strong enough to rip the frail Terran ship to pieces like a sheet of rice paper in a hurricane was broiling only a light-year away and was approaching very rapidly.</p><p>"When will that storm reach this position?" she asked.</p><p>Karen punched up the numbers. "About ten hours. Its a force nine storm, I've never seen one that powerful before." Her expression was one of awe and fear. In the face of something like that one had to develop a very healthy respect for the forces of nature.</p><p>"I've seen worse." Ryoko replied.</p><p>"This is weird, I'm reading low level energy emissions from the ship, but no life signs." said Neela. Captain Yamada Seina moved from his command chair and stood behind his youngest wife. In the years since his joining of the GP the young Seina developed into a very well built and handsome young officer. The same could be said of Neela who was the former spiritual leader of her homeworld. Up until the time she met Seina for the first time she looked like an ordinary ten year old. In truth, she was thousands of years old and was kept young by chemical treatments that prevented her from aging. She was growing up now, though the drugs effected her metabolism in such a way that she aged slowly. Her physical age could easily be mistaken as fifteen or sixteen. That did nothing to diminish the fact that she grew up to be one of the most lovely creatures the young Terran captain ever laid his eyes on.</p><p>"We're gonna have to board her then." he said.</p><p>Amane immediately switched off her console. "I'll get my gear." She could tell by the look in her captain/husband's eyes that he planned to go over there too. There was usually no arguing with him either. Over the years Seina changed from the sometimes shy, timid little boy they fell in love with and became a man. A man who didn't take crap from anybody, a man they all loved more than life itself.</p><p>Seina felt a tiny tug on his trousers and looked own. Fuku looked up at him from the floor with a baleful, almost pleading expression. There were tears in the cabbit's eyes.  With a smile Seina picked her up and immediately frowned, the little half-cat half-rabbit creature was shivering.</p><p>"Fuku-chan, what's the matter?" he asked her soothingly.</p><p>Fuku was the mind of the Kamadake II.  Like her big sister Ryu-Ohki she was a creation of Professor Washu.  In time she had developed the ability to transform into a child-like form just like her big sis. Everyone on the ship adored her, she was the main control system for the ship, but to the crew of the Kamadake II she was their mascot but most of all a member of their family.  They had all come to depend on her, and right now her attitude had Seina and the others very worried.</p><p>"You sense something, don't you." he said questioningly.</p><p>"Miya." the cabbit nodded.</p><p>Amane smiled as she approached.  "Don't worry, we'll be fine." The beautiful, blond GP officer scratched the little creature between the ears. Even getting scratched in her sweet spot didn't diminish the dread that Fuku was sensing from the ship only a few hundred meters off their starboard bow.</p><p>"Come here." said Neela as she gently took the little creature out of Seina's arms.</p><p>"Something's making her nervous, increase the power to the sensors and warn us if you pick up anything strange." Seina told her and she nodded.</p><p>"As that storm gets closer the effectiveness of our sensors will diminish pretty fast." she warned him as he and Amane left the bridge. Ryoko went to the weapons control panel and brought it to life. If it became necessary to defend the ship she decided to be ready now.</p><p>Seina and Amane were no strangers to spacewalks. Even after all these years going out into the void of space with only a thin suit to protect you still gave Seina a slight case of the willies. Never mind that same suit was stronger than steel, made of a substance that was neither fabric nor metal, and could withstand most energy-class small arms fire. They could have used the boarding tube to access the Carl Sagan, but space pirates tried to ambush and board them by hijacking ships before. The crew learned their lesson after the second takeover attempt and decided to board ships via spacewalks and then use the tube once the ship was secured.</p><p>The hatch on the outer hull of the Terran ship was a universal design that allowed it to be connected to a wide variety of different docking mechanisms. The two GP officers reached the hull and attached themselves via their magnetic boots.  The artificial gravity on the hull either wasn't working or the ship didn't have any. The hatch control lights were on but didn't respond when Amane tried to open it. Looking down the length of the ship they noted the location of the crew quarters. It was the section of the ship that was rotating in order to produce an effect like gravity. Why they weren't using artificial gravity neither of them understood.</p><p>"See if there's a manual override." said Seina. They looked around, the hull of the ship was covered in a layer of accumulated dust from the nebula. Seina found the hand crank that opened the latch and began working it. Slowly the hatch open, there was a spray of dust as a small amount of atmosphere vented into space. They climbed inside and Seina manually shut the hatch from the inside. The inner hatch door opened with the wall panel, it would have been harder to get into the ship if it hadn't.</p><p>"We're in." Amane reported into her microphone.</p><p>The corridors of the ship were boxy in shape and had recessed lighting along the ceiling and floor. Hand rails ran along both sides of the corridors. A schematic of the interior of the Carl Sagan appeared in Seina and Amane's face plates.  With weapons held out in front of them they began to systematic search of the entire vessel. For an advanced star ship it seemed, to Amane's eyes, very primitive but that was only due to its overall design. The ship had been built on Earth using advanced alien technology. No Juraian technology went into building the ship but she recognized many of the systems they passed as having been developed on other worlds. Soon, they reached the main computer.  That had been a purely human development, its was a quantum computer.  Quantum computers had molecule sized circuitry and operated at speeds there are astronomically higher than those of conventional computers. While Earth had been developing early versions of this kind of technology it wasn't until the free share and exchange of knowledge that happened when Earth joined the Galactic Union did the development of this specific class of computer become possible.</p><p>"We found the main computer room.  It looks like its still operational. No bodies yet." Seina reported.</p><p>They began to move towards the crew quarters section of the ship which was in the ship's middle. As the bulkhead door hatch opened it was immediately apparent that something wasn't right.</p><p>"We got blast points. Looks like small arms fire." said Amane when she saw the black scoring on the walls. She tightened the grip on her sidearm and they both moved forward.</p><p>Seina whistled, "Looks like they had one hell of a fight too."</p><p>Slowly they moved down the main corridor. Hatches to all of the crew quarters lined either sides.  They stopped at one, Amane took her position as guard and gave Seina a nod. He triggered the access panel and brought up his own weapon.  The girls on the bridge of the Kamadake II jumped when Amane's scream carried over the loudspeakers.</p><p>Seina went into the small chamber while Amane leaned against the corridor wall to steady herself. I've seen body strewn battlefields, I've seen bodies floating in space after explosive decompression, and I've seen bodies at crime scenes but never anything like that., she told herself in abject horror and revulsion. The special training holovids weren't quite enough to prepare her for what was in there.</p><p>"We found one of the crew." Seina said into his mic. The body was emaciated like it had been mummified and its skin was a dark brown. He'd seen bodies too, more than he really cared to count. It came with the job. In space the a body tended to loose its moisture and become mummified like this one.  Those bodies tended to be hard and brittle, requiring forensics staff to handle them with great care, but when Seina touched this body it was still soft. Plus, there was breathable air in this part of the ship, it wasn't in a vacuum.</p><p>"Are they alright, do you want me to prepare sickbay?" Kiriko asked and got ready to hurry to her duty.</p><p>Seina knelled down next to the corpse and replied, "I doubt that'll help this guy." He reached for his utility belt and took out a tiny scanner the size of a pen. Amane came into the room behind him and watched as her husband/captain scanned the body. She knew exactly what the little device was intended to scan for. She hope with every fiber of her being that it didn't find what it was meant to detect.</p><p>"Don't turn green, please not green." Seina said like a mantra as he scanned the emaciated corpse. The pen device beeped and a small green light appeared.</p><p>"Fuck me." Amane whispered while not really all that surprised by the reading.</p><p>"Kar-chan, open a channel to the Juraian Ministry of Intelligence." Seina ordered. There was a strange tone to his voice. The girls on the bridge looked at one another in surprise. They never contacted the Ministry of Intelligence on Jurai for anything unless ...</p><p>"Seina-chan, what's going on over there?" Neela asked. Karen was already hard at work using the array of navigational buoys they dropped on the way into the nebula as one long communications array. Otherwise, their call wouldn't make it past the interference of the nebula.</p><p>"The crew is dead." said Amane, though they found only one body so far chances were they would soon be finding more. A lot more.</p><p>"Ne-chan, Kiriko-chan goto alert status red, all weapons hot. Ryoko-chan track anything that might be moving out there, if it doesn't identify itself blow it out of the sky." Seina ordered as he stood up and a shiver ran through his body. This was his first encounter with this specific species, he's seen the holovid recordings from Jurai. Tsunami, I hope we're ready for this., he told himself.</p><p>"What's happening?" Neela asked, fear now evident in her voice.</p><p>"The crew of the Carl Sagan is dead, but it wasn't space pirates." he said looking down at the body.</p><p>"It was the Darkness."</p><p>It did not take long before another ship came on the scene. It had been three hours since Seina contacted and spoke with Duncan Kurosawa, head of the Ministry of Intelligence on Jurai and the husband to Princess Sasami Jurai. The ship came within visual range of the Kamadake II and parked itself along side. They'd seen this vessel only in holovids. Karen was very excited, she was finally getting to see this specific ship up close. What she wouldn't give for the chance to explore its interior. She'd heard it was magnificent. One of the most advanced vessels in the galaxy next to the Tsunami itself.</p><p>"This is the Kryton, we are on station and ready to assist you Kamadake II." came the voice of a young man over the comm. Amane's eyes widened when she heard the voice and recognized the name of the ship. Holy shit, Jurai sent us the BIG GUNS! A momentary flash of light signified the arrival of Darius Quintarin , son of Lord Orrin Quintarin and the infamous intergalactic mega-genius Professor Washu. He was a part of the close knit circle of friends and confidants that surrounded his Imperial Majesty Lord Masaki Tenchi, newly crowned Emperor of Jurai.  Darius walked into the room where they found the first crew member and knelled down next to the corpse. Amane was a bit jealous, he was able to teleport into the ship despite the interference from the nebula. While the Kamadake II had teleport technology it wasn't anywhere nearly as advanced as the Kryton's.</p><p>"Hey, Seina-kun, Amane-chan. Long time no see." he said as he examine the corpse.</p><p>"Darius-kun, nice to see you again." Seina greeted him cheerfully. They were well acquainted with Darius, after all Seina himself was a member of the Royal Family of Jurai due to his link to the first generation tree seed at the heart of the giant mecha he'd found while trying to save Fuku from space pirate.</p><p>"I'm surprised they sent you." said Seina. He had expected an entire flotilla a Juraian battleships to arrive. One might think it was overkill, but that is until they realized just how powerful the Kryton was. That one ship alone counted for a hundred Juraian heavy battleships alone.</p><p>Darius looked up from his work and replied, "Duncan-kun called Tenchi-kun after you reported in. Tenchi-kun got a hold of okasan and ottosan and they sent me."</p><p>"By the way, good call, this guy was killed by a Darkling and not all that long ago either." he added.</p><p>Amane raised her weapon and trained it on the open door to the room. "How long ago?" she asked. All GP sidearms and ship weapons had been modified per the specs issues by Washu so they would be effective against Darklings.</p><p>"A day I'd guess. It was only a matter of time before we ran into them again." he told her and tapped his wrist communicator. "Kryton, try to cut through the interference of the nebula and scan for any propulsion trails you might be able to find."</p><p>"That will be excessively difficult with that ion storm bearing down on us, mi'lord. Not to mention also that this vessel has been drifting for some time." Kryton's somewhat British-like accent came over Darius' wrist comm.</p><p>"Do your best." Darius told him. He knew that Kryton's best was way better than what some of the most advanced vessels in the Galactic Union could do to the power of a hundred.</p><p>"No propulsion trails detected other than that of the Kamadake II, but I am detecting an anomalous power source bearing 115.258.45 mark 3." Kryton responded.</p><p>On the Kamadake II Kiriko glanced at Karen, Ryoko and Neela in alarm. "That's practically on top of us!" she exclaimed. Neela began focusing the ship's sensors in the direction. An image appear on her holographic display, it was faint but she could just make it out.</p><p>"What the hell is that?" she asked nobody in particular. Kiriko walked over to her station to have a look.</p><p>"Its big, whatever it is." she said. The object looked like a ring, a massive ring hanging the void of space.</p><p>"Sire, its an object approximately two hundred kilometers in diameter. Ring shaped.  Focusing sensors." the Kryton reported. A few seconds later the ship spoke again and this time in a somewhat surprised voice. "Sire, its a ring portal."</p><p>"Nani?" Seina and Amane said questioningly and look at one another.</p><p>"Say again?" Darius asked into his wrist comm. Did just hear that right?</p><p>"Lord Darius, its a portal, an Elu'Quin dimensional ring portal. Energy signature confirmed, it is Elu'Quin technology." said the ship.</p><p>"Out here, in the middle of the Dead Zone?" Darius asked in absolute shock. They knew of evidence that the Elu'Quin had influenced Juraian culture in ancient times but this was the first time they had true hard evidence of their actual presence in this universe. The Elu'Quin were the ancient race from his father's original home dimension who discovered the Etherium. The building blocks of time and space. Using what they knew of the Etherium they advanced cultural and technologically faster than any other civilization. Mastery of the Etherium meant no longer being constrained by the laws of physics. At their peak they inhabited thirty galaxies and several thousand alternate universes before their fall at the hands of the Darkness.</p><p>"It is entirely possible that this nebula was not here when the device was in normal operation." said Kryton, which Darius guess would make the thing several million years old.</p><p>"Maybe the Carl Sagan detected it and parked here to study it." said Seina.</p><p>Darius stood up and said, "That could be. We'd need to check the flight data recorder."</p><p>Amane headed out the door.  "I know where the computer room is, I'll go check it out." A few hours later they were all back on the bridge of the Kamadake II watching a holovid of the last minutes of the Carl Sagan. To say the effort to defend the ship was a fight was being far to generous. It was a wholesale slaughter. Neela and the other girls held onto Seina with a vice like grip as they watched an army of "things" sucked the crew members of the Terran ship dry one by one. The screams, on Tsunami-sama the screams, Kiriko cried to herself and buried her face in Seina's shoulder. When the video stopped playing there was complete silence.</p><p>Darius was the first to break it. "Damn, I'd almost forgotten how vicious those bastard can be." he whispered. Its been 12 years since the Battle of Jurai, since that time they haven't seen any sign of the creatures.  They knew there were plenty of survivors from the massive battle, but where they've been hiding themselves has been unknown since then.</p><p>Neela was visibly shaking.  She'd seen the holovids of the Battle of Jurai, but no amount of training could have prepared her for this level of brutality. "Is that what they're really like?" she asked, her voice trembling.</p><p>Darius' expression as hard as the edge of a sword. "I've seen worse, but yeah Ne-chan that's what they're like." Worse indeed, the things took the idea of perversion to new extremes. The things they did to children shouldn't ever happen to any sentient being.</p><p>Fuku had been sitting on her pedestal in the middle of the ship's bridge munching a carrot when she looked up and cocked one ear. She began to jump up and down meowing frantically. Red warning lights flashed on and the girls rushed to their action stations.</p><p>"Sire! I have several inbound contacts half a light year out on an intercept course with us!" came Kryton's warning over Darius' wrist comm.</p><p>"ETA?" Darius asked him.</p><p>"Five minutes. Sire, I'm detecting massive Darkling energy signatures." the ship replied in a solemn tone. The color drained from everyone's faces except for Darius himself.</p><p>Darius cracked his knuckles and said, "Beam me over. Its time to kick some ass." Its been a long time since he's seen some real action. Space pirates were really bad when it came to dog fighting and Darius one of the best star pilots in the galaxy next to his father.</p><p>Somewhere in a more familiar universe ...</p><p>It had been one of the hardest, fiercest, meanest most vicious brawls Saotome Ranma had ever lived through. This fight made his battle with Prince Herb look like a bitch slap contest. He hurt all over despite the fact that he had an incredible ability to recover from serious wounds and that he also had the Gift. He and Akane sat on the back of an ambulance while their sensei Lady Ambrosia spoke to someone whom identified themself as a representative from the office of the prime minister.  Furinken High was all but gone, all that was left of the school was just a shell of its former self. Fire fighters were busy trying to save what was left and keep the fire from spreading out of the campus and to the residential homes that surrounded it. American Marines and Japanese Home Defense troops were stationed all around the site.  Men in white lab coats sifted through the remains of the school picking up debris and putting it into clear plastic bags. Several news crews were nearby all broadcasting live from the scene. Ranma's keen hearing picked up on what one of them said. From the gist of the reporters spiel it looks like they were being seen as national heroes.</p><p>He noticed that sometime during the fight a gaggle of young girls dressed in ridiculously short fuku showed up. He never saw them before but he knew of them.  They were something called Senshi and they usually hung out around Juban fighting Youma. They took one look at the battle and decided to stay out of it. A tall and rather well put together green haired Senshi had also stood in their way as if to stop them from getting involved.</p><p>Ranma heard them now. The blond one was crying because they didn't get to help out, the green haired one who was apparently called Pluto was telling her something about crystals and Tokyo or something like that. He turned his attention to his wife who was having her arm bandaged by a paramedic.  Ranma was very proud of his Akane-chan. She not only held her own in that fight but took down two Darklings by herself. They were the smaller younger variety. The one he took on was an Ancient, and it beat the holy hell out of him until he got so pissed off that his rage unleashed a blast that vaporized half of its body. Lady Ambrosia came out of the fight without a single scratch, she dispatched a few of the creatures before coming to Ranma's aid. By the time that happened the fight was pretty much over with. Feeling a presence approaching Ranma looked up to see Lady Ambrosia and a man in a business suit walk up to them.</p><p>"This is Kobayashi-san from the Home Office," the ancient Amazon Weaver said in introduction. "He'd like to speak with the two of you if it's alright."</p><p>"Sure." Akane said weakly and leaned up against her husband.</p><p>"I first want to say that this nation owes a great debt of gratitude to you for what you did today," he began. "In holding off those monsters you bought time for the Americans and our Home Defense troops to evacuate the school saving many lives."</p><p>Ranma just shrugged, "A martial artist's duty is to protect those unable to protect themselves."</p><p>"You're national heroes, all three of you. That fight was seen on live television all over Asia." Kobayashi told them. Ranma winced a bit, at least Shampoo hadn't been here if the Amazon got wind that she was still alive there would be trouble.</p><p>"We're free to go and we've been invited to dinner at the Imperial Palace this weekend." Lady Ambrosia explained.</p><p>"Imperial Palace, as in the home of the Emperor?" Akane asked in surprise.</p><p>"Face it you two, you're celebrities now." their sensei said with a smile.</p><p>Ranma rolled his shoulder and winced visibly. "Man I'm gonna really feel it in the morning."</p><p>"Nothing a good hot mineral bath won't fix." said Lady Ambrosia.</p><p>The government man gave them both a card and said, "This is my card, I've been assigned as your liaison to the Home Office by the prime minister."</p><p>"What's a lesbiwahatits?" Ranma asked not really familiar with the word.</p><p>"Liaison, I'm sort of a go between, a messenger between you and the prime minster and the emperor." Kobayashi explained. He pointed towards the group of mini-skirt wearing super heroes and said, "We also keep up a constant dialog with the Sailor Senshi as well. A long time ago we recognized the benefit of keeping an chain of communication going between our office and certain groups who worked for the common good of Japan and Asia."</p><p>"That and anyone who went up against youma with conventional weapons usually didn't live long." they turn towards the voice to see the tall, green haired vision of beauty that was known as Sailor Pluto walk up to them.</p><p>"Ah, Pluto-san, nice to see you." the government man said with a polite bow.</p><p>"Hi Kobi-chan. How's the wife the kids?" Pluto asked.</p><p>Kobayashi shrugged, "Just fine, wife's going back to school to finish her degree and the little ones just start high school."</p><p>Pluto turned her gaze towards Ranma and Akane. So, she thought to herself, these are the two I saw in the Gates. If what I saw was correct then the coming of Crystal Tokyo isn't far off. Small Lady seemed rather excited when she saw them too. She kept cheering them on calling them great grandma and great grandpa.</p><p>"That was rather impressive out there." she said locking eyes with Ranma. Her eyes were like Lady Ambrosia's, they were ancient eyes, eyes that have seen too much.</p><p>"I'm not certain what those creatures were, but they certainly weren't youma." she added.  She noted that the pigtailed youth was rather cute, beat all to hell but very cute none the less. If she hadn't noticed the wedding ring on his finger and the one on the girl leaning against him she'd consider trying to court him.</p><p>"They are called the Darkness." said Lady Ambrosia. Setsuna's face turned pale for a moment before she recovered. By all that is holy, not THEM, she cried out within her mind.</p><p>"I see." she said.</p><p>"You have no doubt heard of these entities." Lady Ambrosia said to her fixing her with a knowing stare.</p><p>"Only that I know they were responsible for the destruction of countless worlds and the extinction of millions of sentient civilizations, and that they are invulnerable to even the most powerful of nuclear weapons." Pluto said and the government man turned white as a sheet.</p><p>"But, they're dead now, right?" Kobayashi asked them.</p><p>"Just those Darklings.  More are coming." Lady Ambrosia explained.</p><p>Kobayashi looked like he was about to sick to his stomach. He looked at his watch and said, "I ... I need to be going ... I ... I must report this to the Home Office." He quickly bowed to Pluto and the others before running for his car.</p><p>"He's rather excitable but a good man." said Pluto who watched the frightened man leave.</p><p>She turned her attention back to the two teenagers and smiled. "We'll have to compare notes one day about these Darklings. Get a good rest, you two have earned it." She gave them a sensual wave with her hand and left to join the other Sailor Senshi not far away.</p><p>"That don't sound too bad." said Ranma.</p><p>"About what?" Akane asked him, who was feeling a little jealous about how good that green haired girl looked in her outfit.</p><p>"Some rest." he said and suddenly looked very tired, almost on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Lady Ambrosia turned to the paramedic who had been bandaging Akane and asked, "Would it be possible to drop us off at the Tendo dojo just up the street? I doubt the young man will be able to make the walk home."</p><p>The paramedic, a young woman, nodded. She had a wild, horrified look in her eyes. She had been with one of the first medical teams to arrive on the scene and had witnessed the battle first hand. She had also overheard what was said about those very same creatures. She drove them to the Tendo dojo where they were met by the entire family. They'd seen everything on TV. Even Nabiki was crying when they ran out to help the two teens stumble into the house.</p><p>Elsewhere in another reality ...</p><p>The battle in space was over. The Kamadake II faired well in its first skirmish with Darkling ships. These vessels had been of a new design that Darius hasn't ever seen before, and though they were faster and more maneuverable than any previous Darkling ships they were no match for the Kryton. Like the Kamadake II they relied on ion thrusters for sub-light propulsion. The Kryton was a gravitic ship which moved with the use of a space-time propulsion field. It was able to travel far above the speed of light without suffering from the same time dilation effect which other ships avoided by submerging into subspace. For very long range travel the Kryton could fold space, jumping from one point in space to another instantly. The space-time propulsion field allowed the huge vessel to move with the speed and maneuverability of a fighter while those inside felt no or very little inertia at all.</p><p>As the battle progressed the two ships were soon joined by Kimi-Ohki, Washu and Orrin's own private ship. Slightly resembling the Ryu-Ohki, the cabbit ship was one of Washu's latest creations. Though Washu wasn't his biological mother Darius still loved her nonetheless. The Ryu-Ohki herself followed along behind with Kyle Brandon at the helm. The saucy Aussie, virtually almost a clone of Steve Irwin, lived for this sort of thing. He'd been a college exchange student from Australia when he and Ryu-Ohki met. It wasn't long after Jurai announced its presence to the Earth and began the negotiations which lead to the planet joining the Galactic Union. The cabbit girl had gained a mastery of Japanese and English by that time, and the young Aussie had been spellbound by her unearthly beauty. Ryu-Ohki spent nearly all her time now in humanoid form. After only dating a few months they were engaged to marry. Tenchi and the other were a bit reluctant to accept the engagement but Ryu-Ohki explained that she truly loved the man. As a wedding gift Washu slightly modified Ryu-Ohki's DNA to make her genetically compatible with humans. Their rather unorthodox relationship was the catalyst which finally brought the Earth into the Galactic Union.</p><p>"The molecular analysis is complete. The object is composed of pure etheralite, the same substance Galea and Kryton are composed of." Washu explained. They were all gathered on the bridge of the Kimi-Ohki.</p><p>"There can be no doubt now, its an Elu'Quin artifact. We found dozens of them in my home universe. The Elu'Quin used them to travel back and forth between the different realities they inhabited." said Orrin. He and Washu turned towards a large holographic display hanging in the air before them. Looking back at them from the image was his Imperial Majesty Lord Masaki Tenchi, her Imperial Majesty Lady Masaki Ayeka Empress of Jurai, and her Imperial Majesty Lady Masaki Ryoko Queen of Jurai. In twelve years they aged very little and still looked as young as they had been since they first met one another.</p><p>"Any idea on where those Darkling ships came from?" Tenchi asked.</p><p>"I analyzed the debris from the ships. They were of an organic design belonging to a race we have only just recently had some contact with in the past three years." the Kryton explained over the comm link.</p><p>"The Vorlon?" Ayeka asked with some surprise.</p><p>Washu nodded, "They'd been heavily modified by Darkling infestations but yes they were Vorlon ships. No sign of any Vorlon crew members in the debris, its looks like they had control over these vessels for some time."</p><p>"Spectral analysis shows these where the same Darklings that killed the crew of the Carl Sagan," Darius explained. "The Kamadake II is towing her back to Earth now. I contacted ambassador Yosho so he can inform the Terran Democratic Union senate."</p><p>"The Galaxy Police is now at alert level epsilon and all orbital defense stations over Jurai have been put on alert." said Ryoko. Like Misaki before her she was now the head of security for the royal family. Not that anyone could threaten the trio, royal guards or no royal guards. Picking a fight of them was a death sentence.</p><p>"I doubt they'll try a full assault on Jurai, not with all the preparation we've made." Orrin told her.</p><p>"Hai, this time we're more than ready for them." said Washu. Indeed they were, with her help as scientific adviser to the crown she and Orrin rebuilt the shattered remains of the Juraian fleet and re-engineered it into one of the most powerful star ship fleets in the known universe. It would take a massive force of Darkling ships to penetrate Juraian space now.</p><p>"But, the discovery of this dimensional portal worries me. Before they didn't have access to other dimensions due to the lack of power, but now there's no telling how long they've had control of that thing." said Tenchi. The young emperor of Jurai had taken his post with some reluctance despite Funaho's tutoring. Azusa simply could not continue his duties any long as emperor, his injuries and the damage caused by the dark energy Kagato infected him with were taking their toll. He was told by his royal healers to either step down or his job was going to kill him one day. Tenchi didn't want to see is great grandfather suffer so he agreed with reluctance to accept the crown. Azusa and his wives retired to the Masaki residence on Earth which was now considered diplomatic territory. The shrine his grandfather tended for seven hundred years was now an embassy for the planet Jurai. His father Noboyuki and stepmother Kiyone served as Yosho's ambassadorial assistants. Mihoshi was the head of security, despite some misgivings from the GP, but over time the clumsy blond managed to clean up her act some. She was still a klutz, but she was so much of an airhead anymore. She and Darius were an item once, mostly their relationship involved lots and lots of hot steamy sex. Mihoshi was sleeping with about four guys if the latest gossip from Kiyone on Earth was correct. Darius himself had been involved with a really cute little number from Earth named Hotaro. She'd been raised by lesbian parents and was now a doctor stationed at the Lake of Tranquility Space Port on the moon.</p><p>"I can tell you its still very operational, so there is a good likelihood that they've been using it." explained Washu. If the Darkness had somehow established contact with others of its kind in other universes it didn't bode well for them. If the Darkness controlled this portal for years they could very well have a strong foothold in this dimension. We'd never be rid of them!</p><p>"Three carriers have arrived and are on station guarding the portal now. If the Darkness tries to take it back they'll have to fight for it." Orrin told them. These ships were a new class of Juraian ship, built pretty much the same way most Juraian vessels are built with a sentient tree as its heart, but using technology developed by Washu they were much more.</p><p>Tenchi heaved a heavy sigh, "I can just imagine what the Holy Counsel will say to all of this."</p><p>Ayeka didn't like seeing Tenchi in distress, she could feel his frustration coming through the link they shared with one another. Life for them had until this moment been rather peaceful for them. Sure, there had been the occasional intergalactic megalomaniac who tried to cause trouble now and again, but overall life was good for the trio. Their relationship had not changed all that much since the day she and Ryoko decided to set aside their rivalry and accept the fact that Tenchi loved them both.  Their link, the Great Bond, which allowed them to feel one another's feelings and know one another's thoughts served to strengthen the love they felt for each other. Knowing one another in a way no other union could possibly allow had the effect of changing Ayeka and Ryoko. Their rule against threesomes got thrown out the window many years ago.</p><p>"I can check the memory storage addresses within the ring's main processor to see if its been used recently. Its possible that the last dimensional address used might still be stored there." said Washu.</p><p>"Do that please, Washu-chan, we're going to have our jobs cut out for us here on Jurai. A lot of people remember the horrors of the Great War. I don't want to start a panic." said Ayeka. Jurai certainly had a lot of recovering to do after the war was over. The evil twisted minds of the Darkness drove them to perform horrible atrocities. Some on Jurai were just now getting back to a semi-normal life. The ones who suffered the most were children. If there were a way to wipe out the Darkness forever, she certainly wouldn't hesitate to use it.</p><p>"I could start by going to Vorlon space and ask them about their missing ships." Darius suggested.</p><p>"That might be a good ..." Washu began when she was suddenly cut off by a new voice chiming in on the comm.</p><p>"This is the star carrier Yamato, we have multiple inbound boogies at 034.125.448 mark 2! ETA six minutes! They are not responding to hails."</p><p>"Kryton." Darius called into this wrist comm.</p><p>"I see them. Counting twenty targets, a few are of the same configuration as before but the rest are capital ship class vessels. Massive Darkling energy readings." the ship AI responded.</p><p>"Damn, they don't waste much time do they?" Ryoko commented wishing she could be there when the fight started. Her sentiment was shared by her husband and Ayeka who felt her thoughts and feelings through the Great Bond.</p><p>"Star carriers Yamato, Macross, and Nadesco this is Special Agent Quintarin, ready action stations!  Scramble all alert five combat frames and engage intercept!" Darius said over his wrist comm.</p><p>"Understood, all ships going to battle stations and launching combat frames to intercept. Weapons going hot, target ETA five minutes!" came the reply. From the forward view holovid on the bridge Darius could see a swam of small mecha zoom away from the three carriers. They were a new concept for Juraian warships, the star carrier. The combat frames were mecha designed for space, water, sea and air. They moved using gravitic propulsion like the Kryton and thus were able to perform inhuman maneuvers, plus they were developed by Orrin based on mecha designs used by his people.</p><p>"Sorry you gotta miss out on the fun." he then said to the trio in the holovid.</p><p>A flash of static discharge played across the exterior holovid illuminating the interior of the bridge for a second. "That storm is getting closer." said Orrin.</p><p>"If its wreaking havoc with our sensors just imagine what its doing to theirs." his son replied.  He waved goodbye to them before disappearing in a flash of white light as he teleported back to the Kryton.</p><p>"Eh! What's go'n on? The ships just launched frames and their going flat out like a lizard drink'n!" Darius heard Brandon's call over the comm on Kryton's bridge. The Aussie sat in the control chair on the bridge of the Ryu-Ohki which was parked not far from her sister.</p><p>"Check your threat board." Darius told him. Ryu-Ohki displayed the appropriate screen for her husband and the saucy Aussie whistled.</p><p>"Cricky. Uh, Sheila, better raise shields love looks like we're about to have company." he breathed.</p><p>Darius went to his redesigned control station on the Kryton's bridge. The ship had been given to him by his father as a birthday gift and Kryton had been all too happy to be his new companion. After all, he help in raising the young man after his mother died during the war against the Darkness in their home universe. Darius sent the great ship forward easily catching up with the wings of combat frames which were racing to intercept the incoming fleet.</p><p>"All frames maintain intercept formation until within firing range, at that point break and attack." he ordered over the comm.</p><p>"Roger." the different wing commanders said in reply.</p><p>"This is alpha leader, we have visual sighting!" Darius peered through the thick dust and clouds of the nebula and could just make out a fleet of vessels in the distance.</p><p>"Let me and the carriers deal with the capital ships, take out the smaller vessels. Break now!" Darius ordered and the combat frames swarmed over the Darkling ships like angry hornets. With weapons that resembled high tech rifles the mecha opened up on the first of the smaller ships. It didn't even have a chance to fire back before it blossomed into a raging, spherical ball of expanding gas. The other Darkling ships were reacting to the attack, yet as fast as they were they couldn't get a good bead on the small mecha as they zoomed about at incredible speeds.</p><p>"Lets get the big one first." Darius said as he turned the Kryton towards the latest of the Darkling capital ships. It was a massive vessel of Vorlon design infested by parasitic Darkling biotechnology. The ship appeared in his targeting display and locked on. Two brightly glowing torpedoes launched form the Kryton racing towards their target. At the last possible second it broke into a dozen small particles each colliding with the massive ship. Bright blossoms of destruction bloomed across its hull ripping the ship open in several places sending atmosphere and pieces of Darkling bodies into space.</p><p>"I analyzed their hull configuration, they have a weakness near the aft engine exhaust vent which may render their engines inoperative." Kryton said displaying the data on a holovid.</p><p>"Good work, Kryton." Darius thanked the ship AI and pulled the ship into a sharp turn. His maneuver would bring the ship along the hull of the big vessel from the front allow him to do a strafing run along the way. The Kryton didn't get very far when suddenly the vessel lurched to one side and began to spin out of control. Damage indicators on Darius' panel lit up like a Christmas tree all over the ship.</p><p>"What the hell was that?"</p><p>"Some form of time-space distortion weapon, type unknown. I have hull breaches and explosive decompression on multiple decks, no vital systems damaged. If their aim had been off by three centimeters we wouldn't be having this conversation." the ship replied.</p><p>"Son of a bitch, it went right through our shields!" Darius exclaimed checking the sensor logs.</p><p>"Our shields and time-space distortion field would have no effect on weapon." Kryton informed him.</p><p>Darius called over the comm, "All vessels, take evasive action. They have some new time-space distortion weapon, goes right through your shields!"</p><p>"Are you alright?" he heard his mother ask.</p><p>"Bruised but not battered, mistress." Kryton replied fervently.</p><p>"Darius, you're being targeted!" Ryu-Ohki warned him over the comm. Darius slammed the controls and drove away as a wave of distortion shot through the area the Kryton had just been a second before.</p><p>"BASTARDS!" the young prince cried as he rushed the gigantic vessel. The Kryton shook violently as it unloaded everything it had all at once. Brightly shining beams and particles of destruction lanced out and pierced the mighty beast.  The explosion tore open the great vessel and kept going until it erupted out the other side. The nose of the giant vessel tipped downwards from Darius' angle and it began to slowly spin out of control. Secondary explosions puff out the hull of the ship like heat blisters, a few blossomed outward. Soon these traversed the entire length of the great ship until like a one giant oozing boil it broke open and became a rather short lived yet bright star in the darkness of space.</p><p>"Just like old times." Darius said with a feral smile as he locked onto another ship.</p><p>"Hey! Leave some for us!" Orrin called over the comm. The Kimi-Ohki raced in front of the Kryton and cut loose on one of the capital ships in the rear. Several distortion wave beams lanced out from the ship narrowly missing the cabbit ship.</p><p>"Uh oh, looks like that wasn't the only one with big teeth." he heard his mother say.</p><p>"This is the carrier group, we are in position to fire main guns." came the call from the Yamato.</p><p>"All frames clear the field of fire!" Darius ordered and turned the Kryton sharply. When all of the ships were out of the way the carriers charged up. Incredibly bright beams of energy lanced out form the three ships piercing three of the capital ships like giant spears. The massive Vorlon designed vessels where holed and blew themselves apart from the inside blossoming into bright balls of energy. With four of the capital ships down, and most of the smaller vessels being mopped up it looked like this wasn't going to be a very hard fight after all. That all changed when all of a sudden a massive shape loomed out of the thick clouds of the nebula.</p><p>"Oh shit!" Darius exclaimed and took immediate evasive action. Three distortion beams lanced out and struck the Yamato dead on. The grand Juraian star carrier survived the hit for all of two seconds before it expanded into a fireball.</p><p>"Yamato is down, I repeat Yamato is down! All ships retreat!" Darius ordered.</p><p>"What about the portal, we can't abandon our posts?" came a question from the Macross.</p><p>"We need to regroup and cover our options, besides that storm is right on top of us." Orrin barked over the comm.</p><p>"Roger, carrier group leaving combat zone. All frames return to hangers, Yamato frames route to Nadesco.  Engaging FTL." The two remaining carriers turned and immediately jumped out followed by the mecha.</p><p>"Time to go." Orrin said look at his wife. Kimi-Ohki did the lightning fast calculations needed for an FTL jump. Before they leapt out of normal space they watched as the Kryton raced past the ring portal. Two of the big capital ships cut loose their beams converging just as they passed through the opening in the great ring. A massive static discharge hit the ring at that very moment triggering the giant device. A vortex formed in the opening pulling the powerful Kryton inward.</p><p>"SHIT! Route all power to propulsion field!" Darius shouted as the ship shuddered violently.</p><p>"The portal is malfunctioning, we cannot pull out of its influence! Our propulsion fields is attacked to the vortex!" Kryton shouted over the loud squealing of internal systems pushed to their breaking limits. A bright flash erupted from the ring portal and then the Kryton and the vortex were gone.</p><p>"NOOOO!" Washu screamed as the Kimi-Ohki and Ryu-Ohki jumped out.</p><p><b>To be continued...</b></p>
