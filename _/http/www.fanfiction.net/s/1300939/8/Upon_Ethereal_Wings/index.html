Kyle Brandon will be my tribute to a great man who gave so many smiles to the children of the world and who died for a cause that believed in. If only we could all have such bravery and dedication.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>oOOOo</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Chapter Seven – The Visitor Part 2</b></p><p>Sunlight streamed in through the bedroom window and right into Ranma's eyes.  He groaned and pulled the covers over his head. One of his arms was pinned underneath a soft, warm body laying next to him in the bed.  He was used to waking up with Akane next to him now, he didn't wake up in a panic like he did after their first week of marriage. He wrapped his other arm around her and pulled her close. He heard Akane make a gentle sound as she snuggled up against him more comfortably. It had been two days since the brutal battle at Furinken High. Brutal was a kind word, they barely won that fight and there were supposed to be thousands of those monsters on their way to Earth very soon. At least they had time to rest when they went to the royal palace to meet the Japanese royal family. He was surprised at how down to earth they were. He thought that they might try to act like the Kunos, high and mighty, but in truth they were friendly and very curious. The Emperor of Japan was an ordinary guy.</p><p>Lady Ambrosia had given explicit instructions to the fathers that Ranma and Akane were not to be disturbed. Nabiki, Kasumi and Shampoo made sure that they obeyed those instructions. A few times Ranma woke to a sound out in the hall. He recognized the hollow ringing sound of a bonbori mace as it hit something hard headed, then the sound of two baka tumbling down the stairs. The noise brought a smile to his lips every time. Even Happosai was behaving himself, but that was because he'd learned to be very afraid of Lady Ambrosia, or to be more accurate he was afraid of what she could do to him despite his martial arts prowess.</p><p>"What time is it?" he heard Akane ask sleepily.</p><p>Ranma looked over at the clock on the nightstand. "Ten." he replied.</p><p>"Ugh.  I don't want to get up. I'm still sore all over from the fight." Akane complained as she shifted her position again and leaned into his brace.</p><p>Ranma sat up and brought Akane with him. She gave him a rather cute "how could you" look when he said, "Come on, can't sleep all day."</p><p>"We still have some of that mineral bath salt Lady Ambrosia gave us the other day?" she asked as she reluctantly allowed her husband to help her stand.</p><p>"Yup." Ranma replied. Though she was going to be The One according to Lady Ambrosia she didn't have Ranma's incredible ability to miraculously recover from injury. She was improving though with his help. With a steady arm Ranma helped Akane out into the hall. Shampoo smiled at them as they headed for the stairs. The bubbly Amazon followed them to the bath. He knew what she was going to do, she was going to stand watch outside to keep the fathers away. Did she sleep at all, he wondered. They were going to have to do something special for her as thanks.</p><p>Akane winced but sigh as she slid into the hot soothing waters of the furo.  It was already filled and the water treated with Lady Ambrosia's special salt mixture. It made the water a little cloudy but it did wonders for your aches and pains. Another good soak in this and Akane was going to feel just fine.</p><p>Akane snuggled up against her husband and slowly started to drift off to sleep again. Ranma didn't try to wake her, he put his arm around her to make sure she slip under the water and just let her rest. She deserved it, she did really well in that fight with the Darkness the other day. He was really proud of her. Damn, here they were only just a few weeks married and already things were so different between them. No fights, no mallotings, no jealousy, and no lethal cooking.  Between Lady Ambrosia, Shampoo and Kasumi the Tendo family would never suffer food poisoning. Besides, the few times she did make a little something for him he was able to shift around a few molecules here, a few atoms there, and transform it into something a little more edible. Not entirely tasty, but not lethal either. He did often wonder how it was he knew which molecules to change and which atoms to reconstruct. That was advanced physics or so he thought.  It was just one of those things he'd been taking for granted since developing these weird powers.</p><p>"We gotta do something nice for Shampoo. I think she stayed up all night keeping the baka twins from bugging us." he said while his free hand played with Akane's hair.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane drawled sleepily.</p><p>"It must be hard on her not being able to see her family ever again.  They think she's dead and because of their laws she can't ever go back." he said sadly.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane replied.</p><p>"You awake?" Ranma asked her.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane said.</p><p>"Maybe I should turn into a girl then you and me can goto the Kuno mansion and have a threesome with Tatawaki." he said with a playful smirk.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane replied. She remained silent for about ten seconds before bursting out of the water. Mallet-sama appeared in her hands for the first time in weeks and her eyes burned with holy rage.</p><p>"NANI!"</p><p>Ranma grinned from ear to ear and said, "Gotcha!"</p><p>Shampoo heard the shout from inside the bath then blushed a bright red when a very different sound started to echo out. Down the hall Soun and Genma were timidly peering around the corner when the sound reached their ears.</p><p>"You hear that Tendo?" Genma asked him.</p><p>"I sure do Saotome." Soun replied.</p><p>They clasped hands and cheered, "Heirs!"</p><p>"Oh brother." Nabiki sighed dejectedly as she sipped her morning tea.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>oOOOo</b></p><p>MAIN PROCESSOR CLUSTER RESTART COMPLETE</p><p>REBOOTING PRIMARY OPERATING SYSTEM</p><p>LOADING CRITICAL SERVICES INTO CORE MEMORY</p><p>LIFE SUPPORT ...

Kryton's avatar detached itself from a nearby wall and hurried over towards the sound. It lifted a huge piece of ceiling debris up and tossed it aside with ease to reveal Darius Quintarin underneath. The young Satari prince wince when he moved but with Kryton's help was able to stand. His incredible metabolism, inherited from his father, was already working on repairing any injuries he might have. Darius surveyed the damage to the bridge and was amazed that they somehow survived what happened. The place was a wreck.</p><p>"Are you injured? Should I prepare med lab?" the ship AI asked with concern.</p><p>Darius put up his hands and limped over to a chair that was still intact.  "No, I'll be ok in a few minutes. I've been hurt worse than this." he said. "How bad are we hurt?"</p><p>"I have multiple hull breaches over several decks, FTL is off line, subspace communications are not functioning, shields are not functioning and weapons are inoperative." Kryton reported.</p><p>"Do we at least have standard propulsion?" Darius asked him. If they couldn't move they were in trouble.</p><p>"Yes, standard propulsion is operational, mi'lord." Kryton replied.</p><p>Darius turned to the nearest console and began tapping out commands. "Where the hell are we? Is this is the Sol System?" he exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"Affirmative, however my sensors detect no significant space traffic. No navigational beacon from the Sea of Tranquility lunar base nor any beacon from any earth based space ports." Kryton explained to him in a serious tone.</p><p>Darius looked up at the main view screen. It snapped into existence showing a view of the Earth with the moon in the distance. "This is not good." he said.</p><p>"Shields and cloaking system are none functional, sire. I advise we move away from the planet so we are not detected." the ship AI suggested.  Darius nodded and the ship began to move away from the planet slowly.<p>"Let me guess, you don't have our dimensional coordinates in memory." Darius guessed as he check another nearby console.</p><p>"I'm afraid so, sire. My processor core went off line the instant we entered the event horizon of the portal." Kryton replied, a sad expression on his liquid metal face.</p><p>"Fuck," Darius sighed.</p><p>It did only take a few minutes for Darius' body to repair itself. He was up and about quickly and started to do a room by room inspection of the ship to find out what needed fixing and what systems could be rerouted where. He was deep within the bowels of the vessel when he came to a room filled with shattered debris. He picked up a piece of material that looked like shattered obsidian. It was black a broken up like shards of glass. Each piece had thousands of small hairline cracks running through them.</p><p>"Kryton, tell me this isn't what's left of the FTL drive." he said.</p><p>"I'm sorry to say it is, sire. It will take my nanotech repair system three months to regenerate a new one. The material the drive is composed of is difficult to synthesize even with our level of technology." the ship replied.</p><p>Darius tossed a piece of shattered FTL drive across the chamber and swore.  "Three months is a long time. Its time we don't have." he said.</p><p>"I understand sire, but there is no way to speed up the process." Kryton explained.</p><p>"Lovely, just lovely." the young prince muttered as he slowly backed out of the chamber. He eventually made it further into the ship. The hanger deck was undamaged. Because the Kryton was larger on the inside then it was on the outside in order to admit ships into the docking bay a portal system was necessary. Darius went to the controls for that system and was happy to find it still in working order.</p><p>"At least this still works." he said. The smaller craft in the spacious hanger bay did not have FTL drives except for his private combat frame. It wouldn't have the power needed to move the Kryton to another universe though. Making is way through service tunnels and shafts he returned to the bridge. The planet earth dominated the view from the forward view screen. It was a world his late mother called home though she lived most of her life on Galea with his father. Though he'd already grown to love his new mom Washu he still remembered and cherished the memory of his birth mother.</p><p>"This is going to be a very boring three months." he said taking his seat at the helm.</p><p>An alarm sounded, Darius was getting tired of alarms and warnings.  Casually he waved his hand by the display control and brought up the screen that demanded his attention. "Sire, trace Darkling energy has been detected by my sensors." said the ship's AI.</p><p>"Where?" Darius asked sitting up to look at the screen. Sitting on his thumbs for three months really wasn't something he wanted to do. Now, fighting Darklings on the other hand was fun. Loads of boredom killing fun.</p><p>"Mid northern hemisphere off the coast of China. To be more specific within the Tokyo suburb of Nerima, Japan." Kryton answered.</p><p>"What is it with Japan? No matter what universe we goto that place is worse than the Bermuda Triangle." Darius laughed and zoomed the sensor readout of the main island of Honshu in the forward view screen. Several bright energy spikes appeared on the display. Three in Nerima-ku and ten in the vicinity of Jubaan-ku. The residual Darkling energy was in Nerima. Darius focused the sensors on one of the energy spikes in Jubaan-ku and an image appeared.</p><p>"Nice." he said when the image of a tall girl with long black hair appeared on the screen. Her outfit was something out of a teenage romance manga, a sailor style fuku with an unbelievably short skirt which showed off a pair of very impressive legs. Darius guessed her age to be around sixteen, which would make her legal assuming this Japan had similar laws to the ones back home.</p><p>He called up images of the other energy spikes. Darius was impressed, the dark haired little girl of fourteen was kind of cute, but fourteen was a little young even for him. Now, the older woman with green hair certainly looked promising. The blond with the meatball hair dongles looked a pretty but after examining her for a bit Darius got the impression she was a ditz. Ok, so Mihoshi was a ditz too but she was a ditz who liked it rough.</p><p>"Sire, I do hope you aren't planning what I calculate you may be planning." Kryton said.</p><p>Darius looked over at the ship's avatar, pointed to himself and in an innocent voice asked, "Who? Me?"</p><p>The avatar put on an expression that looked coy. "Sire, you are exactly like your father was when he was your age. I can read you with relative easy." he said.</p><p>Darius smiled, "Well, we are going to be stuck here for three months, and there were Darklings down there. I really, really should investigate." He turned to the image on the screen of all of the girls together fighting some weird looking monster.</p><p>"Most definitely." he said licking his lips.</p><p>"Just like your father. I suppose talking you out of this will not suffice?" Kryton said.</p><p>Darius shook his head and replied, "Not one bit."</p><p>Kryton sighed, "Ara."</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>oOOOo</b></p><p>School was never going to be the same again. Lady Ambrosia saw to it that the building was restored back to the way it was before the battle.  Even if you looked at it up close you never would have been able to tell that the place had been effectively leveled only three days before. Those students who were uninjured in the attack were able to return. For Ranma and Akane the whispers and stares they got from the students were a bit unnerving. For the better part of the morning everything was quiet but the couple could sense that something was off. When lunchtime came most of the students left the classroom quietly without saying a word. The couple left to have lunch together but immediately began to notice something wasn't right. Nobody was in the school yard or the cafeteria. It was like the entire student body has vanished.</p><p>"You don't sensing any Darklings around do you?" Akane asked Ranma.</p><p>"No, but I know where the other kids are." he replied.</p><p>Akane nodded and said, "The gym."</p><p>They ran around the school towards the gym and approached quietly. They could sense it, every student and teacher in the school was in there, but why. Ranma got in front of Akane as he slowly opened the door.  Akane put her hands on his shoulders to steady herself. He was still a bit sore from their big battle. Inside was total darkness.</p><p>"Hey!  Why is everyone hiding in there?" Ranma shouted. All he heard in reply was an echo.</p><p>"This is starting to creep me out. Why are they doing this?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Lets find out." he said as he took her hand, opened the door enough for them to walk through and stepped inside. Beyond was darkness, the light that entered a huge gym came from the door behind them. As they ventured forward the couple whirled around defensively when the door closed behind them, then their world filled with light and sound.</p><p>A deafening roar filled the gym as more than four hundred Furinken High students all began to cheer. Ranma and Akane couldn't even begin to comprehend what was going on until they turned around. Principle Kuno of all people stood on a stage with a huge banner hanging overhead which read "Hurray For Our Heroes" in big bold Kanji.  Akane blushed furiously and held onto Ranma's hand tightly.</p><p>"Hey there keiki! Da big kahuna owes ya da big fava for savin da skool!  Ya?" the Hawaiian shirt wearing principle shouted into a megaphone.</p><p>The kids all screamed in assent and Principle Kuno said, "So we hold'n dis ere party! Hey, wahini lets git dis party started!"</p><p>Akane threw her hands to her mouth when someone whom she recognized came up on stage. She had never seen her in person but had always dreamed of doing so for a long time. The woman on stage walked up with a microphone and said, "Ranma, Akane, this song is dedicated to you."  The crowd went wild as the lights dimmed and the music started. The song was one of Akane's favorites called "Evolution".</p><p>"That's ... that's ... that's ... Ha ... Ha ... Hamasaki Ayumi!" Akane stuttered in shock.</p><p>"Ain't she like your favorite singer?" Ranma asked her, also feeling a bit embarrassed by all of this attention.</p><p>"Who did all this? I ... I ... I can't believe it was Principle Kuno." Akane asked looking at Ranma who just shrugged his shoulders in response.</p><p>Somewhere across town a man at the office of the Prime Minister of Japan sneezed so violently he was knocked out of his chair. Principle Kuno made his way out of the gym to his office. With a huge grin on his face he looked at the substantial check sitting on his desk. It was filled out to the school, though, but at least it meant that he wouldn't have to dig into Kuno clan funds to upgrade the computer lab computers to the new Intel-based iMacs.</p><p>A literal crowd of students escorted the honored couple home when it was time for the party to finally wrap up. Ranma and Akane waved good bye to everyone as they left and thank them for the incredible time they had. They were both exhausted, despite being stiff the couple had enjoyed a few slow dances. Kuno was at the party but kept his distance from them. Ranma would often see him directing a scornful look in his direction. Sasuke was running around doing acrobatic ninja stunts and getting cheers from the students. The party was a lot of fun with games, dancing, music by a famous voice actress, and a few very touching speeches by people who knew the couple. It was pretty clear by the end of the day that Ranma and Akane knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were love and respected by everyone at Furinken.</p><p>Ranma helped his tired spouse upstairs to the bedroom. They were too wore out and tired to get take a bath. There was no school tomorrow so they could thankfully sleep in. The two slipped out of their clothes, electing to sleep in their underwear, and snuggled up under the covers. As soon as their heads hit the pillows they were both silently snoring away. Lady Ambrosia, however, found it difficult to sleep. For the past day or so she'd been feeling something unusual.  It seemed familiar almost but different all at the same time.  Whatever it was it was close. She was certain that it wasn't hostile nor was it a Darkling, but it certainly wasn't human either. The ancient Amazon Weaver went out onto the roof of Tendo-ke and look up at the stars. The presence was ... up there ... but try as she might she couldn't fix on it, she couldn't extend the reach of her senses to touch whatever it was that was there. Then, the feeling changed, it was getting closer now, a lot closer. Just as she felt this something drew a bright line across the sky.</p><p>It was a reentry burn.</p><p>Atmospheric reentry wasn't something the ordinary person went through on a day to day basic but for Darius it was pretty much routine. Gravitic drives like those which were used on the Kryton made reentry burn for large ships a thing of the past, but small craft still created a brief light show when they came down. Darius' combat frame was equipped with the latest in shielding technology fresh from his mother and father's research labs. Though the surrounding air molecules were reaching a temperature of several thousand degrees none of that heat reached the frame.</p><p>A combat frame was in a sense a mecha; a robotic vehicle capable of walking, running, and flying. Darius' specially customized one of the stock combat frames used by the new Juraian armed forces. He installed a new sensor array which had twice the range, the new shield system of course, a weapons package which he himself heavily modified to increase their range and power output, and a number of other highly advanced technological enhancements which are highly classified within the Juraian government. The command module was spartan, nearly all of the frame's controls were done via neural link. To Darius' perspective the sensors of the frame where his eyes, ears, and other senses. Its arms and legs were his arms and legs, and everything else "felt" and functioned like they were a part of his body. He could feel the atmosphere's resistance against his shields become stronger which told him he was entering thicker atmosphere. The frame had finally slowed down to a speed where the air resistance no longer generated immense heat. According to his sensors and GPS data he was over the main island of Honshu and approaching Nerima at Mach 4.</p><p>Darius' hoped that anyone who saw his entry into the atmosphere would just chalk it up to being just a small meteor. One of the classified systems in his frame made him invisible from terrestrial radar and other more advanced sensors. So he should be undetectable by any civilian and military air traffic radar. It was night time also which also helped because his frame was painted black. During the day another highly classified technology would make his frame invisible to the naked eye. Being a special agent for the Juraian Ministry of Intelligence had its perks.</p><p>"You do promise to please check in every few hours, my lord?" Kryton pleaded over the comm.</p><p>Darius smirked and replied, "Yes, I'll check in. Nanny."</p><p>"Might I remind you sire that we are in an unknown universe on a parallel world which we know nothing about where Darkling energy signatures were detected." the ship A.I. Retorted.</p><p>"You know what your problem is Kryton, you got no sense of adventure." Darius told him straight up.</p><p>In a tone that seems rather smug the ship A.I. Replied, "I'm programmed to be adjective, to analyze all possible threats and to advise against certain actions which could encounter such threats."</p><p>"You were more fun to be around before you were rebuilt." Darius sighed and shook his head.</p><p>"My 'nagging' sire is my way of trying to keep you safe. After my unfortunate 'accident' on Earth only certain portions of my main computer core could be resurrected and the rest had to rewritten." Kryton said sounding hurt. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes Darius tended to forget that Kryton was also designed to feel emotion. After the Evil One possessed Kagato's body during the war twelve years ago, he used his immense powers to knock Kryton from the sky. In the great war back home his father defeated the Evil One, but this time around it was Tenchi who saved the day.</p><p>"I'm sorry. I won't do anything that might endanger me but I've been up against hordes of Darklings before and I've been on extremely dangerous missions. I can take care of myself down here, I'm not a child anymore, don't fret over me and just concentrate on repairing that fold drive. Ok?" he replied softly.</p><p>There was a brief silence then Kryton said, "I am sorry also sire. Your mother was a special person in your father's life. In protecting you I am fulfilling a promise I made that I was unable to fulfill when the time came." Darius had few memories of that time. He was just a child when the Darkness came to Earth. He grew up listening to stories about the heroics of the great war, of all the brave Alliance warriors who gave their lives to protect the Earth and its people. A race of people it turned out were the decedents of the Elu'Quin, much like his father's people the Satari.</p><p>"That was a long time ago. Besides, I like killing Darklings so if I find any I'll dedicated their destruction to you and mom." Darius replied beaming a smile.</p><p>"Perhaps I am being a bit too much of a mother hen, sire." the ship said.</p><p>"Don't stop on my account. Keeps me honest." Darius laughed.</p><p>For the first time Darius actually heard the ship laugh, then it said, "Alright, sire. Please report in from time to time, enjoy your 'adventuring' and try not to get into too much trouble down there."</p><p>Darius shrugged and asked, "Hey, what could possibly go wrong?"</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>oOOOo</b></p><p>Matriarch Cologne opened her eyes slowly and tried to stand up but her body wouldn't respond. All she could remember from the night before was going to bed after a bit of lite readings. She barely remembered the sound of her front door being smashed in and being roughly pulled out of bed. She tried to fight, knocked away several of her attackers and then felt a prick in her right shoulder. A dart, yes, it had been a dart. She had no idea how long she'd been asleep, she was barely able to remember what the dart looked like. It was of Amazon make. She couldn't remember the faces of those who attacked her but she did remember their voices. They were all women.</p><p>"I see you are finally waking up." said a voice to her left. Cologne struggled to turn her head and found herself face to face with one of the elders of the village.</p><p>"Am ... ber ... gris," Cologne crocked out with some effort.</p><p>"The drug will begin to wear off soon, the first to come back will be your vocal cords, but then you already know that since you are rather familiar with Amazon potions." the elder Ambergris said with a smirk. She was old, almost as old as Cologne, and like the ancient matriarch age had not been very kind to her.</p><p>"What ... is ... meaning of this?" Cologne demanded, and as the elder had said it was getting easier to talk but she still couldn't move very well.</p><p>The ancient elder leaned down to look into her face and said, "I was about to ask you the same question." She moved out of Cologne's line of sight and to her surprise found the rest of the elder counsel were in attendance.</p><p>"Grandson, come forward and tell us what you told me." she heard Ambergris and Mousse walked into view. He looked at her with a satisfied smirk on his face. All of the color drained from Cologne's face when she saw him. She knew why he was here and what he'd told his grandmother Ambergris. It was only a matter for time before this happened, she just wasn't expecting it to happen this soon.</p><p>"Matriarch Cologne has lied to us about the death of Shampoo. She failed to secure her husband Saotome Ranma and according to the law had to be punished, but instead the matriarch left her in Japan and told us she'd been killed in battle." said Mousse.</p><p>The elder named Sapphire stepped forward and demanded, "Where is your proof? And, why should we accept the word of a male, especially a male whom we all know is obsessed with Cologne's great granddaughter?"</p><p>"Mousse came to me a week ago with this news. I took the liberty of dispatching warriors from my clan to Japan to collect evidence to prove or disprove what he said. They returned with these." Ambergris said and dropped a handful of photographs in front of Cologne's face. The ancient Matriarch could see them in the torch light. There was one picture of Shampoo in one of her signature mandarin dresses helping Kasumi hang up the wash. Her great granddaughter had a truly happy smile on her face. It was the first time in a long time the ancient Amazon has seen such a happy, care-free smile on the young girl's face.</p><p>"Matriarch,  why? Assuming these photos are real, why did you lie to us?" another elder named Satin asked pleadingly.</p><p>"I have no excuse other than I did what I did out of love." Cologne replied and said nothing more.</p><p>Ambergris got into her face and shouted, "And jeopardized three thousand years of Amazon tradition and law in the process!"</p><p>Cologne scowled at her and with titanic effort was able to rise to a sitting position. "What purpose for the tribe would it have served to bring Shampoo back to face a possible death sentence?" Cologne demanded and the ancient elder backed away. She knew Cologne was still under the influence of the powerful drug but she was no fool.  There was a reason why Cologne was Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku other than her supreme intellect.</p><p>"There was room for other forms of punishment." Ambergris said looking over at her grandson.</p><p>The elder's glance at Mousse wasn't lost on ancient matriarch. "That what this is about! You're angry at me because your 'beloved' grandson can't have my great granddaughter!" Cologne shouted accusing the elder.</p><p>"Its gone beyond that," Ambergris said. She produced another photo and placed it in front of the matriarch. The picture was of Lady Ambrosia and Tendo Akane engaged in an obvious Weaver training session.</p><p>"What is Lady Ambrosia doing instructing an outsider female in our secret Weaving arts?" the elder named Lace demanded angrily. She was one of Ambergris' most staunchest supporters in the counsel. A few other elders looked at one another with looks of chagrin and concern.</p><p>Cologne sighed and said, "You all know Lady Ambrosia's independent spirit."</p><p>"According to my grandson you knew this was going on." Ambergris accused.</p><p>"And I tried to persuade her to come back with me but she refused." Cologne said.</p><p>Ambergris put her hands on her hips and said, "But you are the matriarch."</p><p>"And she is our greatest Weaver possessing powers far in excess of my own on top of a rebellious spirit which whom has had very little respect for the authority of the elder counsel and my position." Cologne replied, but she didn't tell them anything more than they already knew themselves. Lady Ambrosia's rebelliousness was legendary among the Joketsuzoku.</p><p>"Nevertheless, teaching our most sacred secrets to an outsider is the most severe breach of our ancient laws." the elder Lace said.</p><p>Cologne sat up, the drug starting to finally wear off, and said, "Ambrosia believes the Tendo girl to be the chosen one spoken of in prophesy.  She is convinced the dark time are near."</p><p>A hushed gasp of shock filled the room and the elders began to silently whisper to one another. "An outsider, the chosen one!  Preposterous!" Ambergris roared in offended outrage.</p><p>Cologne sighed and replied, "She also knew how the elder counsel would react to this as well. I could not deny what she said could possibly be true. I witnessed the Tendo girl's power myself."</p><p>"Cologne, you of all people should have done more to make Lady Ambrosia return home!" Satin shouted.</p><p>Ambergris signaled for quiet and the counsel fell silent. Cologne scowled at her. Since when did the elders listen to "her". Ambergris was from a less prestigious clan and constantly embarrassed over the antics of her grandson and his obsession with Shampoo. Something, she realized, changed and she didn't know it.</p><p>"Its become rather obvious that your time spent around that outsider male Saotome Ranma has clouded your judgment." Ambergris said.</p><p>Cologne laughed, "And how do you possibly think that?"</p><p>"Because the Tendo girl is romantically linked to him, and now she is the one whom Lady Ambrosia is instructing. She was an obstacle to Shampoo fulfilling our sacred laws and your great granddaughter failed. Not only that but now she lives with them!" Ambergris replied.</p><p>"So how does Ranma possibly figure into this?" Cologne asked her.</p><p>Ambergris smiled and said, "Simple. You are afraid of him. My grandson has relayed to me what happened between Ranma and the Musk's Prince Herb, how the boy defeated the prince in battle." There were sudden murmurs among the elders. It was the first time any of them heard about this at all.</p><p>Cologne didn't like what she was heard and stood up. "Are you accusing me of cowardice!" she roared and manifested a battle aura.</p><p>"The westerners have a saying, if the shoe fits ..." Ambergris replied with a smirk. Cologne growled with anger and looked like was about to launch herself at the elder but then decided it really wouldn't accomplish anything.</p><p>"This all proves nothing. I've had my fill of this, and of you." Cologne said calmly and turned away to leave. To her surprise she found several warriors blocking her path.</p><p>"I am still matriarch, it would be unwise to try my patience further." she said in a dangerous tone to the ones directly in front of her.</p><p>"Not quite," Ambergris said behind her. Cologne turned around with a questioning look at her.</p><p>"When it was discovered that you had lied to us about your great granddaughter and how you'd allowed Lady Ambrosia to give away our most sacred secrets I was able to persuade the counsel to a vote of no confidence." Ambergris told her.</p><p>Cologne's mouth fell open in shock then she stormed up to the ancient elder and screamed, "You did what!"</p><p>"I would advise you 'elder' Cologne to speak to the Matriarch with more respect. It would be unwise for 'you' to try 'my' patience any further." Ambergris said with a wide tooth filled grin.</p><p>Cologne's anger are barely in check as she said, "How dare you? You question my loyalty to the Joketsuzoku and call me a coward, and what do you do? You drug me in the middle of the night and call an important meeting and a vote without me in attendance to present my own evidence. All are violations of our laws!"</p><p>"The ancient laws have no provisions for dealing with something this delicate. I'm sorry Cologne but we have spoken." the elder Lace said calmly.</p><p>"You chose 'her'? The elder of a clan that is the laughing stock of the entire tribe!" Cologne demanded pointing at Ambergris.</p><p>"Until such time as we can retrieve Lady Ambrosia and your great granddaughter, you elder Cologne are confined to your home. As for the Tendo girl, as the law demands she must be eliminated." Ambergris said in an authoritarian manner.</p><p>Cologne sighed and said, "You know now the path you take our people down, Ambergris. You nothing about either Tendo Akane nor Saotome Ranma.  You see him as just a mere male, but he is more and if you do indeed succeed in eliminating the Tendo girl you shall unleash an enemy against us which none or our warriors could ever defeat."</p><p>"You may overestimate this male's abilities, but I am a realist. There cannot possibly be a male martial artist who is that powerful." Ambergris replied.</p><p>Warriors surrounded Cologne to take her to her home. As she was being lead away she said, "Your prejudice shall be your undoing, as it was almost mine."</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>oOOOo</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>To be continued ...</b></p>
