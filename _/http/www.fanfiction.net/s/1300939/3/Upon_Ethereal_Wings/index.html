</div>DISCLAIMER: "Ranma 1/2" is the property of Rumiko Takahashi, Kitty Productions, and Viz Communications.<p>**********<p>UPON ETHEREAL WINGS By Michael "TheZorch" Haney<p>**********<p>Chapter Two<p>Life certainly got strange around the Tendo Dojo, but then the Tendo Dojo was always a magnet for strangeness especially with a sex- changing martial artist named Saotome Ranma living there. There was a silver lining though. The aftermath of the titanic battle with Prince Herb served as the catalyst for change in the relationship between Ranma and Akane. For the first time they were a real couple. Things between them have changed, but that happens when you almost loose the person you love. Akane knew for a long time she loved Ranma but her own foolish pride would not allow her to accept it. It was when he came close to not returning from that horrific battle, one that ended with a mountain being destroyed, that she finally let go of her anger and allowed her true feelings to surface. Change is hard though and Akane lapsed back into her old self from time to time, but would look into Ranma's blue eyes and would be reminded that she almost lost him. That was all the motivation she needed to endeavor to be a better person, a better iinazuke, and someday be a better wife. Life did deliver a few surprises along the way though, and it came in the form of the Amazon Weaver named Lady Ambrosia.<p>Tendo Akane walked slowly through a field of yellow flowers, the field ran off into the distance with rolling hills that resembled the setting for the old gaijin movie "The Sound of Music". A warm breeze made the grass dance and carried with it the perfume of the flowers, the sky was clear with a small smattering of white, fluffy clouds. This place was so tranquil, so peaceful. Akane sat down, laid back, and stared up into the sky at the clouds as they slowly moved across her view. Never in her life did Akane feel such a sense of total peace and tranquility, it literally flowed through her very being.<p>"Beautiful isn't it?" came a voice that suddenly startled the youngest Tendo sister.<p>Akane bolted upright in surprise then sighed with some relief when she recognized the face of her Amazon sensei. Lady Ambrosia knelt down next to her and looked up at the clouds above them.<p>"What is this place?" Akane asked her. Though she felt no malice in this place, no sense of danger, there was still an unreality about it that made her suddenly uneasy.<p>Ambrosia smiled at her and sat down next to her apprentice. "This place has many names, some call it the 'spirit world', others 'limbo', but it truth it is what is sometimes called the 'astral plane'." she replied.<p>"How did I get here?" Akane asked. She picked up one of the flowers and sniffed it. The fragrance was wonderful, and the flower certain did feel and smell quite real.<p>"The astral plane is the realm of higher consciousness, the physical cannot exist here, normally." Ambrosia explained. "You are actually sleeping in your bedroom right now in your father's house, but your soul has traveled to this place so that we may talk."<p>"You no doubt have many questions for me, mostly concerning what happened this morning." she went on with a knowing smile.<p>"Y-Y-You know about that?" Akane looked at in surprise. It suddenly made her wonder if the powerful Amazon might be watching over her every move.<p>"Know about it, my dear I felt it." Ambrosia laughed. "That poor Kuno boy is going to be laid up for several weeks after what you did to him."<p>Akane looked away in embarrassment. "I wasn't trying to kill him, but he was attacking Ranma and-"<p>"You lashed out with your emotions." the Amazon finished for her.  "They can be very powerful when coupled with one who has the Gift. That boy is lucky to be alive."<p>Akane looked down at her feet. "I hope I didn't disappoint you, sensai."<p>"Nonsense child, you made me proud." Ambrosia said to Akane's surprise. "You were defending your mate, you acted like a true Amazon."<p>That last comment made Akane blink. "Ranma does not true me." Ambrosia added with a small smile.<p>"He thinks you're part of some scheme to get him and Shampoo together." Akane replied.<p>"What do you think?" the Amazon asked her.<p>Akane looked away putting her hand to her cheek in thought. "I don't know, maybe he's just being paranoid."<p>The old woman put a gentle hand on Akane's shoulder. "I do not blame him, I can only imagine the trouble Cologne must have caused that young man in the past." she said.<p>Akane laughed, "You have no idea."<p>Lady Ambrosia laughed in reply, "Oh, trust me child, I know old Cologne better than she knows herself. I know what she is capable of."<p>The old Amazon walked around in front of Akane and stopped when she was finally standing face to face with her. "Today we will begin your first lesson in what it is to be a Weaver" she said. "I want you to exercise your new abilities as you learn them so they become easier for you to perform."<p>"Could that be dangerous?" Akane asked a little concerned.<p>"Everything a Weaver does has the potential to be dangerous as long as you don't let the power get away from you and roar out of control." Lady Ambrosia reassured her.<p>Akane nodded. "Ok, so what am I going to learn first?" she asked.<p>"Advanced Perception." Ambrosia told her. "With it you will be able to see everything around you, even in total darkness."<p>Akane started in surprise. "I'll be able to see in the dark?"<p>"Not like with night vision or infrared, but I will teach you how to see the other ranges of the spectrum in time." the Amazon explained. "This is very different, you will learn to perceive the presence of reality around you, the basic structures of the building-blocks of space and time."<p>Ambrosia nodded towards her. "First, there is no time on the astral plain, so you must be awake for us to accomplish this."<p>Suddenly the lush hills and mountains fell away and Akane found herself in her bedroom. A glance at her clock told her she'd been asleep for nearly five hours. Slowly she sat up and instantly detected a presence in her room.<p>"This place will do nicely for what we need to do." came Lady Ambrosia's voice.<p>"You were here in my room all this time?" Akane asked her.<p>Ambrosia smiled. "You do not have to be asleep to venture into the astral plain, dear."<p>"Uh." Akane stood up and faced her sensai. "What do I do first?"<p>The old Amazon woman put her hands on Akane's shoulders and looked into her eyes. "First, close your eyes." Akane did as she was instructed and waited. "Now, stretch out with your thoughts, feeling the room around you." Akane concentrated and tried pushing all other thoughts out of her head. After several minutes she let go of the breath she was holding and her shoulders dropped.<p>"I can't." she said disappointedly.<p>"You are trying too hard, try again but this time let your thoughts flow outward slowly." Lady Ambrosia told her. "Imagine your thoughts are like a stream, slowly flowing outward then widening into a river and encompassing everything in its path, then opening out into the ocean and covering all."<p>Akane closed her eyes again, this time she relaxed and let her thoughts stream outwards slowly. For a long moment she wasn't sure if anything was happening, her mind was totally blank and empty of random images generated by her thoughts. Slowly shapes began to appear in the darkness, it started slowly at first. Akane widened the flow of her thoughts but did not increase the speed of the flow and the shapes began to become more defined. It took only a few seconds before she recognized the outline of her bed, the shape of her bedroom door and the door frame, the square, oval, and rectangular shapes of the pictures on the walls. She had a full three-hundred sixty degree view of her whole room, and she could "perceive" all of it at one time. What she was not able to see were the colors of her sheets, the design of her wallpaper or the pictures themselves other the shapes of their frames.<p>"I can see it, but I can't see any detail like colors or pictures." Akane said still focusing on what she was doing.<p>"You will get that later on today in our lesson, but for now I want you to practice on feeling the world around you for now." Ambrosia told her.<p>Akane noticed that she could feeling Lady Ambrosia in front of her. The curved shape of the Amazon's body was before her, she was the only thing in the room that was different from the rest of the objects in the room. There was a glow that seemed to come from within the center of the woman that flowed outward like a bright light, but what Akane was experiencing could not really be called actual "light" except it was represented in her mind's eye as a form of perceived light.<p>"There is some kind of glow coming from inside of you." said Akane.<p>"Your advanced perception allows you to see my life essence." Ambrosia explained to her. "You will see it whenever you are 'perceiving' and living things are around you. Not just people and animals, but also plants."<p>"Now, I want you to walk down to the sitting room and sit down at the table there." Ambrosia went on as she went to the bedroom door. "All while using your advanced perception to find your way, and no peeking." As she said that last part the Amazon waved her finger at Akane eliciting a smirk from her.<p>"Ok, I'll try." she said.<p>Keeping her eyes closed and her grasp upon the perception of the world around her Akane tentatively walked towards her bedroom door. She could not see herself in this state of mind, but somehow she 'knew' exactly where her arms, legs, and hands were. She reached out and grasped her door knob and stepped out into the hallway. She made her way down the hall and to her top of the steps. Her perception registered the many steps that lead down to the first floor, and like with her hand she 'knew' where to step with her foot. The sitting room was situation in a narrow portion of the house that attached the main house to the dojo and had two sets of Shoji doors on either side that could be opened during the day to let the breeze through. She could even feel the koi pond and the surface of the water. Small pinpoints of "light" in the water indicated the presence of the carp beneath the surface. Slowly she approached the table, to one side she sensed the forms of two people. One was tall and slender, the other short and very wide. Those had to be her father and Genma, she reasoned, and the square shaped object between them was the Go board they always played all the time. When she reached the table Akane sat down, she 'knew' when to stop moving so she did not run into the table.<p>"Excellent." Lady Ambrosia said with pride in her voice.<p>"I did it!" Akane cheered. "I could actually feel everything around me!"<p>"You have taken your first tentative steps toward becoming a true Weaver, Tendo Akane." Lady Ambrosia said with a grandmotherly smile.<p>Akane smiled. "I can see where that power would really come in handy, but I still can't see detail like colors."<p>"Like solid shapes, colors and textures are a part of reality also, and with your advanced perception you will be able to see these things as well." Ambrosia told her. "It is well documented that many of the great Weavers of the past were totally blind, yet they could see as well as you or I, perhaps even far better."<p>Akane looked at her in surprise. "Way better, especially if they can see the kind of detail I was seeing." she said. "I could even see the cob webs under my bed."<p>Lady Ambrosia smiled and nodded. "Seeing things on the surface is not all you can see, you will be able to see what lies below the surface of things as well."<p>"Like ground sonar?" Akane asked her.<p>Ambrosia gave a small laugh. "Sort of like that, yes."<p>"What you sensed today would have overwhelmed an ordinary human mind." Lady Ambrosia went to tell her. "Only the mind of one who has the Gift can process the enormous amount of information flowing in from your senses."<p>"I never knew I had this kind of power inside of me." Akane said in astonishment and looked down at herself.<p>"This is only the beginning." Lady Ambrosia told her.<p>"Hey, what's up." said Ranma as he came into the room from outside. He spotted the old Amazon woman and frowned suddenly.<p>"Ranma, it was incredible!" Akane said excitedly. "I was able to see with my eyes closed, well its not like seeing, its more like feeling my way around, but I could discern shapes enough to make it from my room down here without falling down the stairs!"<p>"What are you talking about?" he asked her and he looked at Ambrosia.<p>"Akane is learning one of the basic techniques of the Weavers." she said. "The ability to 'perceive' the universe around her even in total darkness."<p>"I can't see colors though, only shapes and textures." Akane added.<p>"This is the easiest ability to learn, now we will practice advanced perception viewing colors and detecting light sources." Lady Ambrosia told her.<p>"S-S-She can do that?" a surprised Ranma asked. "With her eyes closed?"<p>The three relocated to the dojo. Lady Ambrosia gathered several pictures from Akane's room and around the house and leaned them up against the wall. She had Akane sit down in front of them, and asked Ranma to blind fold her to make sure she did not cheat. The blind fold was not really to make sure Akane was really using her powers, it was more for Ranma's benefit so he would believe that Akane's powers were real.<p>"Like before, feel the world around you." Ambrosia instructed Akane.<p>Akane 'perceived' a view of the dojo and the pictures against the wall, the effect was instantaneous now instead of slow like the first time she called upon this power. "Alright, I go it." she said.<p>"Now, imagine in your mind's eye that you are turning a dial changing the frequency of your thoughts." the Amazon told her. "Soon you should start to 'see' something."<p>Akane did, she imagine a frequency dial and turned it. Slowly, the gray-shaded outlines of the 'perceived' world around her began to take on vibrant colors. She could 'see' the browns of the wood in the floor, the bright yellow color in her Mother's hair in her picture, the red on Ranma's shirt.<p>"I SEE IT!" Akane exclaimed with joy.<p>Ambrosia smiled. "Truly you must be The One to get this on the first try."<p>* * *<p>Shampoo was very worried. In all of her time in Nerima she had never ever seen Tendo Akane use a chi technique. Worst yet, she recognized the attack that Akane had used on the bokken wielding baka. It was a Weaver technique known as "The Fist of the Earth". Her cousin was a Weaver so Shampoo had some knowledge of what they could do. There was no way that Akane could be using such powers though, she reasoned but was unable to find a suitable alternative to how Akane did what she did.<p>Later upon returning to the Nekohauten she was shocked to learn that the great Lady Ambrosia was in town. The head of the Weavers of Joketsuzoku was here in Nerima! Her great grandmother would give her no more details than to say that the ancient, yet beautiful, woman was in Nerima on special Amazon business and was not to be disturbed. She did encourage Shampoo to try again using the Comb of Suggestion. Shampoo then formulated a new plan to get to Ranma. Using a proxy like Kuno Tatawaki had been a major mistake. She had to get at the boy himself, but actually getting the comb into his hair without him being suspicious was going to be difficult. Then, there was Akane who might interfere. Another wild card was Mousse who managed to escape from his cage the other night and has not been seen since.<p>The 'plan' should work, she was an Amazon and they never failed in their missions. Most of the time. The beautiful Nyanchiczu warrior and future Matriarch sat outside the Tendo dojo waiting for phase one of her plan to take effect.<p>* * *<p>"Ryoga has challenged you to a duel of honor?"<p>Ranma handed the scroll, which he found on the front step of the Tendo home about a hour ago, over to Akane. She read through it and slammed it down on the top of the sitting room table.<p>"Who the hell does he think he is!" she growled angrily.<p>"What did it say?" Nabiki asked her.<p>"Ryoga says he wants to challenge Ranma to a duel, if he wins I have to agree to become his iinazuke, but if Ranma wins he'll leave and never come around here again." Akane told her in a huff.<p>"Well then, all Ranma has to do is beat Ryoga." Nabiki smiled. "Its not like he hasn't beaten him before."<p>"Its the principle of the thing Nabiki!" Akane snarled angrily. "The baka is trying to force 'me' to side with him over Ranma!"<p>"I cannot back down from a challenge." Ranma said calmly. "It is a violation of the Warrior's Code to do so."<p>Akane looked at him with worry but smiled all the same. "You don't have to do this, what that baka says has no influence in this house."<p>"Still, he challenged me and I gotta fight him." Ranma replied.<p>"It also says you have to meet him alone, nobody can come with you." Nabiki said as she read the scroll.<p>"The fight's in one hour, which probably means three or four days." Ranma smirked. "Still the code requires me to be there, whether the directionally challenged baka shows up or not." He got up, leaned over to kiss Akane on the lips and headed for the door. She sighed as he leapt and cleared the wall vanishing from sight.<p>"Hmmm." Nabiki said as she examined the scroll some more.<p>"What is it?" Akane asked her.<p>"Since when did Ryoga have such good handwriting." she said. "And this paper is expensive parchment, the kind used on special documents and religious scrolls." She shrugged and laid the paper down on the table.  "Eh, maybe he's just been practicing and could have gotten the paper from anywhere."<p>"Yeah, maybe that's it." Akane replied.<p>"There is a way that you can tell where it came from and who wrote upon it." Lady Ambrosia said as she poked her head out of the kitchen. She was holding a pan and wearing one of Kasumi's aprons.<p>"How?" Akane asked her.<p>"A Weaver can sense the life essence impressions left behind by the people who previously held an object." she said.<p>"You mean like with psychometry?" Nabiki asked her.<p>The Amazon shook her head. "Not quite, but close."<p>Akane picked up the paper then looked at the old woman. "Concentrate like you do when you are 'perceiving" but this time focus only on the paper and feel for the subtle impressions that people have left behind." the old woman said. Akane closed her eyes and did so. The room sprang up in full three dimensions in her mind with all of its vibrant colors intact, then she focused on the paper. She could 'feel' layers of impressions left behind by several souls that touched the paper and she began to peel through them. First she sensed her own, then Nabiki, and Ranma. She nearly gasped when the next person after them was not Ryoga but the beautiful great granddaughter of Cologne; Shampoo. Akane focused harder on Shampoo's impression and a scene appeared in her mind. She watched as Shampoo opened the scroll, took out a calligraphy pen, and began to write.<p>"This doesn't belong to Ryoga, it was written by Shampoo!" she exclaimed.<p>"But, why would Shampoo write a challenge letter to Ranma saying it was Ryoga?" Nabiki asked her.<p>Akane concentrated some more and the image of Shampoo appeared again. She was writing on the scroll in her bedroom at the Nekohauten. Akane could see the top of the little writing desk the girl had. Her 'sight' focused on an object that seemed to be emitting an odd glow. It was a comb, an ornate wire comb. The glow from the object did not feel natural to Akane's senses.<p>"I can see something that looks like a comb, its got an unnatural glow around it." Akane said as she continued to concentrate.<p>"Akane, I have to tell you something I saw this morning." Nabiki spoke up. Akane opened her eyes and looked at her. "I saw Shampoo pop out of a hiding place after Ranma ran off to take you to see Dr. Tofu." Nabiki continued. "She took something out of Kuno's hair."<p>"What did it looked like?" Akane asked her.<p>Nabiki shook her head. "I wasn't close enough to get a good look."<p>"Could it have been a comb?" Akane wondered.<p>Nabiki nodded. "It could have been."<p>Akane was on her feet in a flash. "Oh my gosh! Shampoo's laying a trap for Ranma, that's gotta be!"<p>* * *<p>"I knew it, the baka got lost again."<p>Ranma sat on top of an old stump that sat in the middle of vacant lot across town. It was not the same vacant lot that sat next to Ryoga's house that they usually used for their battles. That to Ranma was odd, but he did not ponder on it for long. The code demanded that he wait until sunset for the lost boy to show up, then he'd go home to sleep and return later after school. Of course, he did not think Ryoga was good enough for him to observed the warrior's code to honor the baka, but Ranma had his pride. He was unaware of the fact that a pair of attractive eyes were watching him from a distance.<p>Shampoo smiled proudly as she watched her airen sitting there waiting for Ryoga to show up, but of course he was nowhere near Nerima at the moment and it was not him who wrote the challenge letter. The Amazon knew Ranma would never ever back out of a challenge once issued, and he would wait for Ryoga for days if need be. She clutched the Comb of Suggestion in her hand, all she had to do was slip it into his hair and he would do whatever she commanded him to do. The one problem was getting close enough to Ranma without triggering his danger sense to put it in his hair.<p>The beautiful Nyanchiczu warrior slipped out of her place of concealment, a cherry blossom tree across the street from the vacant lot, and concentrated to suppress her chi levels. She remembered that the nice doctor across town was able to suppress his chi so low that his presence was virtually undetectable. Even by her! It had been a little unnerving for Shampoo during her short stint as Dr. Tofu's assistant when she first arrived in Nerima to see out Ranma the outside girl. That was back before she knew about Ranma's Josenkyo curse, before she returned to China in disgrace, received a Josenkyo curse as punishment for her failure, and returned to Nerima with her great grandmother.<p>"Geeze, at least he could have the presence of mind to have somebody show back to the place he set as the location of the fight." Ranma groaned as he sat on the stump looking exceedingly bored.<p>Ranma froze. He felt a null presence near him and looked around.  He half expected Dr. Tofu to show up, whenever he felt that sensation it was usually him. He had the bad habit of suppressing his chi all the time, virtually erasing all sense of his presence. But Ranma had learned to feel for the null presence created by someone who was making an effort not to be detected. He knew for sure Ryoga did not have the ability or the subtlety to be able to do something like that. He shrugged it off after he failed to see anyone around him and decided to get in a little meditation. He folded his legs up underneath him and closed his eyes. He did not see Shampoo slink out of the shadows towards him with the comb in her hand poised to slide into his hair.<p>"Shampoo don't do it!" came Akane's cry from somewhere in the distance.<p>"Huh? Akane?" Ranma blinked and looked up to see her running towards him in the distance. It was then that his danger sense went on red alert. In a flash Ranma rolled forward, flipped hand over heels twice, then stopped on his feet a few feet away and whirled around. A very stunned looking Shampoo looked at him with wide eyes where she stood just behind the stump he had been sitting on a few seconds before.<p>"Ranma!" Akane yelled as she neared the vacant lot.<p>"Shampoo, what are you doing here?" he demanded.<p>"She wrote that challenge letter, its a trap!" Akane cried as she ran into the vacant lot. As she did Shampoo sprang into action. She leapt towards Ranma who quickly dodged out of her way and ducked under the swipe of her hand that grasped the comb.<p>"What are you doing, what is that thing?" Ranma shouted at the amorous Amazon.<p>"Rivalry for Ranma finally over, and Shampoo win." she replied.<p>"Not likely." Ranma said as he took a defensive stance just as Akane ran up behind him.<p>"I don't know what you think you're up to but its not gonna work!" Akane yelled at her.<p>Shampoo raised her hands and showed them to the pair. "Shampoo already win." she said. Her hands were empty.<p>"Huh? The comb, Ranma its in your hair!" Akane exclaimed when she spotted the same comb she had seen in her vision of Shampoo earlier.<p>Ranma raised his hand to pluck it out of his hair when Shampoo said, "Ranma no touch comb unless Shampoo say so." He stopped and put his hands down.<p>"Ok." he said.<p>"What!" Akane gasped in shock.<p>"Now, Ranma walk over to Shampoo and take her in arms." the Amazon said.<p>"Uh, alright." Ranma said as he walked over to the beautiful warrior and wrapped his arms around her lovingly.<p>"RANMA!" Akane cried as she watched his in total disbelief. "What have you don't to him you Chinese bimbo!"<p>Shampoo just looked at her with a defiant smile. "Ranma do whatever Shampoo say, he is Shampoo's airen now and forever."<p>Akane balled her fists and took a fighting stance. "I am not letting you take him away form me!" she snarled.<p>"Humph! Baka kitchen destroyer get in way of Shampoo's happiness for last time." Shampoo said angrily. "Time to get rid of Akane so she never bother Shampoo and airen ever again."<p>"Bring it on sister!" Akane growled as she readied herself for a fight.<p>"Shampoo no fight Akane, think it better if airen have this honor." Shampoo said with a wicked smirk.<p>"Nani?" Akane looked at her in horror.<p>Shampoo turned to Ranma and said in a very loving voice, "Airen, do big huge favor for Shampoo and get rid of Akane."<p>"Ok." Ranma said and he began walked towards Akane slowly.<p>"No! Ranma its me Akane, stop!" Akane cried as she slowly backed away from him.<p>"He no listen to baka kitchen destroyer, he listen only to Shampoo." Shampoo laughed.<p>"Ranma don't do this! Please!" Akane cried as Ranma's big hands encircled Akane's neck and started to squeeze.<p>"Bye bye Akane, been good fight but Shampoo want to take airen home to China now." Shampoo said with a happy smile as Akane felt Ranma's powerful hands start to crush her wind pipe. Before her air was completely cut off she was able to croak out one last sentence.<p>"Ranma, I love you."<p>The Saotome boy's hands suddenly started to shudder and shake slightly. His face which had been emotionless a moment ago now looked strained. Akane felt the crushing force of his finger on her throat slowly let off. If he had applied just a little more pressure, she realized, her neck would have snapped like a twig. Ranma let her go and staggered backwards.<p>"What you problem airen?" Shampoo demanded. "Get rid of Akane now!"<p>Ranma straightened up and started towards Akane again, but he stopped and raised his hands to his hand and staggered to the side. He let out groans as if in terrible pain and fell down one knee while still clutching his head.<p>"Ranma, you kill Akane now, can no resist!" Shampoo shouted at him, but Ranma cried out louder as he tried to stand.<p>"Kill Akane, Shampoo command you!" Shampoo screamed in frustration at the boy.<p>Ranma fell to both knees and looked as if he was trying to rip his own hair out, then his hands reached up towards the comb in his hair and tried to grasp it. Shampoo saw this and cried, "Ranma no touch comb!" Ranma's hands tried again, and this time his fingers grasped onto it.<p>"NNNOOOOO!" he cried as he yanked the comb out of his hair and slumped to the ground unconscious.<p>"Impossible!" Shampoo cried in total dismay. She turned her attention to Akane who looked at the Chinese girl with an expression of pure contempt as she massaged her aching neck.<p>"I can't believe you just tried to make Ranma kill me!" Akane screamed at her in rage. "Of all the things you ever done to us this is the worst! You're a monster, you don't deserve to have Ranma much less anyone else!"<p>The Nyanchiczu warrior produced her bonbori maces out of nowhere and advanced on Akane with murder in her eyes. "Shampoo loose patience, tried to be nice to Tendo Akane but she wait no longer to get airen!" she cried. "Now she take her airen, she do this Amazon way like should be done from beginning!"<p>Akane took a fighting stance even though she knew she did not stand a ghost of a change against the Amazon in a real fight. A million thoughts went through Akane's mind at that moment. She was about to die and she knew it. Shampoo was serious this time about getting Ranma, whether he was willing to go with her or not. It all boiled down to this confrontation, right here, right now, and Tendo Akane was the only thing standing in her way. Hate rose up in her heart, hate for the girl advancing towards her right now intending to end her life. It was so strong, Akane could literally taste it in her mouth.<p>"I hate you!" Akane cried. "I HATE YOU!"<p>All the hate and rage inside of Akane suddenly flared up. Shampoo's eyes went wide and she stepped back as Akane's body was enveloped in an aura of immense power. The girl rose up off the ground a few feet and invisible forces kicked up a powerful wind that made her dress fly up around her waist. Shampoo stopped retreating and took a fighting stance preparing to deliver a Death Blow to Akane's head.<p>"NOBODY TAKES RANMA AWAY FROM ME, NOBODY!" Akane cried as she instinctively cupped her fists in Shampoo's direction. The Amazon gasped in horror was a sphere of energy formed between Akane's cupped hands then shot forth. Shampoo did not have time to dodge the blast, it struck her full force in the chest and pushed her back along the ground leaving a deep trench in the earth. When the dust cleared Shampoo lay crumpled up in a heap of rubble within the remains of what had been the stump Ranma had been sitting on minutes ago.<p>"SHAMPOO! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER!"<p>Akane turned to see Mousse flying towards her with spiked chains coming out of his shirt sleeves. Akane did not try to dodge the chains, she simply raised her hand and the metal links just curved around her body without touching her. When the enraged male Nyanchiczu reached her he produced a katana sword out of his pants and slashed at her. Akane gestured at the blade and it suddenly curled up until it reached the hilt.<p>"What the-" Mousse gasped in shock but did not get to finish what he was going to say as Akane raised her hands and fired off an energy blast point-blank into his face.<p>* * *<p>"I hate being right all the time."<p>Cologne looked up at the ancient Weaver with annoyance as they both watched the battle from the concealment of subspace. She winced visibly as Mousse went flying through the air trailing wispy fragments of the energy that had just hit him in the face full force. She looked over where Shampoo lay and sighed with some relief as she saw some signs of life in her great granddaughter. The beautiful Amazon tried to sit up, instantly regretted it, and clutched a hand to her head in agony.<p>Lady Ambrosia looked down at the diminutive matriarch with a cocky but compassionate smile. "Now what have we learned today?" she asked her.<p>"Do not get smart with me Ambrosia." Cologne warned her, then she sighed when she saw the look on the other Amazon's face.. "Very well, I revoke both the Kiss of Marriage and the Kill of Death placed on Saotome Ranma by my great granddaughter. Is that fine with you?"<p>"If you had done this in the first place they would not have had to go through this." Ambrosia said as she gestured towards the battle scene.<p>"Deciding that was not your place, you presume much and overstep your station Weaver." Cologne growled at her.<p>"Tell me this old friend, since when does Cologne, Matriarch of the Nyanchiczu throw out reason for foolish stubbornness?" Ambrosia asked her. "You're misguided attempt to secure the boy as Shampoo's airen could have doomed her if she had succeeded in killing the Tendo girl. Do you think you could have kept Ranma under the control of the comb forever, its effects are only limited as you have seen here today. He would have eventually freed himself, and then what would you have done?"<p>Cologne just looked at her with a smoldering gaze as Ambrosia went on, "You would have survived maybe three seconds against Prince Herb of the Musk in single combat, even with your considerable skills. Do you think you could have defeated the one who bested the Lord of the Musk, or that our entire village could have survived the wrath of Saotome? The death of Akane would have been the signature on the death warrant of our people, and you know it."<p>Cologne crossed her arms and looked down at the ground angrily. "Who is to say that will not already happen? He will remember what Shampoo tried to make him do."<p>"You presume to know him so well, yet you still know him so little." Ambrosia replied. "Look." She gestured towards the vacant lot where Akane was no longer in the thrall of whatever power she had manifested and was cradling Ranma in her arms.<p>* * *<p>Akane wept as she held her husband to be in her arms and hugged him tightly to her chest. She could feel him breathing so he was alive at least. Akane ignored the sounds of moaning coming from the ruins of the stump where Shampoo was laying at the moment, and could care less where Mousse landed or it he survived or not. Ranma's eyes fluttered open and they looked around unfocused for moment before they locked onto her tear streaked face.<p>"A-A-Aka-ne?" he said straining to say the name.<p>"Ranma, are you alright?" she asked him.<p>"I t-t-think so." he said, then his eyes went wide as the memory of what had just been doing struck him. "Oh-oh no-no-oh Kami-sama, I tried to kill you Akane!"<p>"Shhh! Its ok, its over, you fought the power of that comb Ranma, you didn't hurt me." Akane told him soothingly. She heard more sound coming from the stump and looked up to see Shampoo slowly trying to sit up but not getting anywhere very fast. Ranma was getting his strength back and was now able to sit up on his own. Akane stood up and left him there then walked towards the ruined stump. She reached down and picked up on Shampoo's fallen bonbori maces and walked up until she next to the girl.<p>"You bitch!" Akane spat at her as she raised the mace over her head intending to deliver a fatal blow. A firm but gentle hand stopped her. Akane looked up in surprise to see it was Ranma. His expression was one of sadness but also of compassion.<p>"Please, don't kill her Akane, don't kill her." he said.<p>"She deserves to die!" Akane shouted at him. "She tried to make you kill me!"<p>"If you do this you'll be no better than she is!" Ranma shouted back. "Let it be!"<p>Akane dropped the weapon and threw herself into Ranma's arms sobbing. He held her tightly as she cried and looked down at Shampoo. The Amazon girl was slowly recovering her strength to get up. She knew she was hurt, very badly hurt, she had a few broken bones that she could feel, and was unable to feel her left leg. She laid back after she tried to sit back up for the fifth time and started to cry.<p>"Shampoo so sorry, Shampoo was desperate." she sobbed, tears streaking down her face. "Please, airen no hate Shampoo. Shampoo have no will to live if Ranma hate Shampoo."<p>"I don't hate you Shampoo." he told her softly and the girl's face brightened. That expression turned to immense grief when he went on to say, "I don't hate you, I pity you."<p>"Airen-"<p>"Don't call me that anymore, you don't have the right." he told her. "You lost it the moment you tried to make me kill the woman I love."<p>The woman I love. The woman I love. Those words echoed in Shampoo's head over and over again. She turned her head, unable to look at the pitying look in Ranma's eyes, and cried out in deep sobs. Ranma felt a presence and looked up to see Cologne staring at him.<p>"Shampoo is hurt pretty bad." he told her.<p>"Her wounds will be properly tended to, she will live." Cologne said as she knelt down to examine her great granddaughter.<p>"As soon as she is well enough to travel, I want you and her to leave Nerima." the old the old matriarch. "I do not want to see either you or here in this city again, or the destruction I rained down on Prince Herb will be nothing compared to what I will rain down on the two of you." Ranma's words were spoken calmly without a hint of malice but they made a shiver run up and down Cologne's back nonetheless.<p>"It is as you wish Ranma, I have already revoked the Kill of Marriage and Kiss of Death." Cologne told him.<p>"No, great grandmother, no!" Shampoo sobbed as she shook her head.<p>"What will happen to her?" Ranma asked the old woman.<p>"She will face judgment before the Council of Elders for her failure to win her airen." Cologne replied. "She will loose her status in the tribe and will be stripped of her rights and privileges. It will then be the decision of the council whether to prescribe one of the two punishments the law calls for in this case."<p>"What would that be?" Ranma asked.<p>"Enslavement to the first male who chooses to claim her, which will probably be Mousse." she said. "Shampoo will not have the rights of a warrior, thus Mousse will have the authority to rule over her. He will own her and do whatever he wishes to do with her, and she cannot resist him or suffer terribly if she does. The only other option, which is likely, is immediate execution."<p>"They'll kill her!" Ranma said looking down at the fallen warrior.<p>Cologne nodded sadly. "I will be required to give an account of all of my great granddaughter's failures to win you. Death will likely be her punishment for such dishonor."<p>"Shampoo died in battle." Ranma said and he looked into the old woman's eyes. "That is what you are going to say, Shampoo died in battle."<p>"You want me to lie to the Council of Elders?" Cologne looked at him in shook.<p>"Despite what she did today she doesn't deserve death." he told her. "I didn't know she had this thing over her head! That's why she was so damn disparate isn't it!" With that last statement he shook his fist at Cologne and his battle aura manifested for a moment.<p>"That would be the reason, yes." She nodded. "She has failed to win you so often that death would likely be her only punishment."<p>"As far as you are concerned your great granddaughter died today." Ranma told the old matriarch angrily. "Make it very clear to the council that coming here to cause me or my loved ones trouble is a death sentence in itself."<p>She looked down at Shampoo who was still sobbing. "What of Shampoo?" she asked him.<p>"She'll be taken care of." he told her.<p>The old woman climbed up on her cane. Before bounding off into the distance she turned and said, "Farewell, Ranma. I can't say it hasn't been fun." She turned and bounded away on her cane like a pogo stick and disappeared.<p>"Why did you do that?" Akane asked him. All this time she had been holding him tightly, now she looked up into his face.<p>"Because she don't deserve death." he said. "I had no idea they were gonna kill her if she didn't get me as her husband. I couldn't live with that."<p>Akane looked down at the girl who was still crying her eyes out. "What are we going to do with her?" Akane asked him.<p>"We'll get her to the Doc." he said. "Then we'll see from there."<p>"You're being way too compassionate, she doesn't deserve it." Akane said angrily, but rested her head on Ranma's shoulder and held him tightly.<p>"Come on, she's hurt real bad." he said. Akane nodded and together the two helped Shampoo out of the wreckage of the tree stump. The Amazon groaned in agony as she was being moved, but the two did there best to be gentle. Ranma bent down and gingerly picked the battered girl up in his arms.<p>"Ranma no hate Shampoo?" she asked him sadly, her eyes fluttered as she tried to hold onto consciousness.<p>"No, Ranma no hate Shampoo." he told her.<p>She put her hand on her face and wept. "What have Shampoo done!" She cried. "Shampoo is monster, tried to kill Akane! Now airen no love Shampoo ever!"<p>He carried her an gently as he could as he and Akane headed down the street towards Dr. Tofu's clinic. "Shampoo, I don't love you 'that way', but I hope that we can be friends at least." he said soothingly. "I know maybe ya think you love me and stuff, but I think it was more the desperation you was facing cause if you didn't win me they were gonna execute you."<p>"Shampoo in exile, she can no go back home to China now." the girl said, tears falling down her face. For the first time since the who episode started Akane began to feel real sadness for the young Amazon. "She have no family, no friends in Japan."<p>"You have us." Akane told her startling Ranma. "We could be your family."<p>"Akane would do this even though Shampoo tried to make Ranma kill you?" Shampoo looked at her in shock.<p>Akane looked at the ground sadly and said, "I didn't realize either what you were facing if you failed to get Ranma. I can see why you were willing to do anything. I guess what I'm trying to say is-"<p>"Everybody deserves a second chance." Ranma finished for her. Akane nodded.<p>Shampoo broke out in renewed sobs. "Shampoo no deserve friends like you! She been scared for so long, she know what she face at home, been so scared!"<p>"Shhh. It'll be ok, the Doc's place ain't far from here." Ranma said softly. "Everything is gonna be ok, you got me and Akane here, so you won't be alone."<p>"That's right, we forgive you." Akane told her. "You don't have to be frightened anymore."<p>* * *<p>"See what I mean?"<p>In subspace again, Cologne and Ambrosia watched as Ranma carried Shampoo, with Akane at his side, down the street. She had been shocked to the core that Ranma wanted her to leave Shampoo here in Japan and tell the council that Shampoo had died in battle. Effectively that meant that Shampoo was in exile here and could never go home upon pain of immediately execution. The incredible compassion he was showing Shampoo was also shocking, but not unexpected considering the fact that Cologne knew full well that Saotome Ranma could not bare to see anyone suffer.<p>"You were right, again." Cologne replied to the ancient Weaver.<p>"You should learn to listen to me more often." Ambrosia smiled.<p>"The minute I think I have that young man figured out he suddenly does this and throws me completely off kilter." Cologne said with a lopsided smile.<p>"Its in his nature, he hates to see others suffer, and he would not want to have Shampoo's death on his conscience if he could have done something about it." Ambrosia told her.<p>"What about you?" Cologne asked looking at the old woman.<p>"I have an apprentice to train, a very promising one at that." Ambrosia replied happily.<p>Cologne sighed with a smile. "I must admit, Tendo Akane did impress me with that show of power."<p>"It is that same power that will save our world from absolute destruction." the old Weaver replied looking down at Cologne.<p>"Keep an eye on my great granddaughter." Cologne look up at Ambrosia. "I will not be able to come visit her anymore."<p>The old Weaver looked up where Ranma and Akane were walking together with Shampoo in the young man's arms. "I think she's in good enough hands already, don't you agree?"<p>**********<p>Coming up in Chapter Three<p>It is six months later and Ranma and Akane are married. Shampoo is adopted into the Saotome clan and is now Ranma's sister. Akane's training is progressing well under the tutelage of Lady Ambrosia. However, dark clouds gather on the horizon. The time of the Apocalypse nears.
