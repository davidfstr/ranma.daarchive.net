</div><p>Author's note: ^^; I'm so so so so so so so sorry that it took so long  to update this. But I have some very good excuses, in fact! :D</p><p>1)   A few days after I uploaded the 2nd chapter, Exams  period started, and I had to listen to the teachers instead of writing the  story (like I usually do on boring classes). The afternoons were busy, too,  while I studied for the exams.</p><p>2)    When it was  finally over, I discovered I had a HUGE writer's block. But I'm finally over  it, and I'm here with the last chapter! YAY!</p><p>Oh, the timing can't be more perfect! Yom  Kippur is a couple of days away, the time to apologize! (And starve yourself  ;-;).</p><p>I'm also apologizing for every little grammar  or spelling mistake.</p><p>Enjoy!<p></p><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma½. Rumiko  Takahashi and Viz does.</p>November Rain    Chapter 3<p>Her tears flowed down. He was so helpless- lying and shouting his head  off like that. If she didn't know better, she would have thought he was dying.  She couldn't stand it anymore. She laid her head on his chest and hugged him  tightly. "Ranma…Wake up…" she mumbled through her tears. The rest of the family  watched them with sadness (though you could see little tears of joy on Soun and  Genma's faces).</p><p>He saw a white light approaching him. He  became afraid. <i>'It isn't my time to die yet…'</i> he thought. He screamed  louder and struggled harder. There was something strange about this light,  though. It was warm and comforting, not cold and endless like the darkness. The  light wrapped him. He was scared for a second, but the light's warmness calmed  him down. He ceased with the screaming and struggling, and gave in to the  light.</p><p>Ever so suddenly Ranma calmed down. Akane  was amazed and stared at him with wonder. His face showed less pain, and now he  looked like he was sleeping rather than dying.</p><p>Soun wept happily behind them. "Oh, Saotome.  Isn't it cute how she worries about him?"</p><p>"It sure is, Tendo. It sure is." Genma  answered.</p><p>Akane's face reddened with anger. "How can  you even think of that when Ranma is so sick? What kind of parents are you?  Don't you care?"</p><p>"Sure we do, Akane! That's why we allow you  to stay here with him tonight and watch him." Her father said and Genma nodded  approvingly. "Come on, Saotome! Let's play some Night-Shogi!" Both of them  burst out laughing and left the room. Akane shook her head.</p><p>Ryoga entered the room with a shout. "What's  wrong?"</p><p>"R…Ryoga. Why did you come just now?" Akane  asked.</p><p>Ryoga scratched his head in embarrassment.  "Took me a while to find the right room. What happened?"</p><p>"Well, Ranma had a nightmare, I think, which  is bad considering his high fever. He screamed and kicked everywhere…but he  seems to be okay now". Akane looked at her fiancé with adoration and smiled.</p><p>Ryoga's heart sank as he looked at the scene  playing in front of him. It was hopeless. The way she looked at Ranma…she never  looked at him like that. "Well," he said, "it's time for me to leave. Good luck  with Ranma."</p><p>"You're leaving? But why?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I'll only be in your way, and besides," he  stopped for a minute and looked at moon. "I have some…thinking to do." He said  and jumped outside from the open window before Akane had time to react.</p><p>Akane sighed heavily and looked at Ranma's  face once again, and a few moments later she lay next to him and hugged him with  one arm.</p><p>She almost fell asleep when she heard Ranma  moaning softly. She opened her eyes and found him staring at her with feverish,  tired eyes.</p><p>"Akane…" he whispered.</p><p>"Ranma…" she stuttered back. She was positive  that he will be asleep at least until tomorrow, and was surprised to find him  awake now.</p><p>"Stay with me…" he pleaded and his eyes  started to droop.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Stay with me. I'm scared…of the darkness…"  he fell asleep.</p><p>Akane was sure that her ears were deceiving  her. Ranma was afraid of the <i>darkness</i>? Ranma is not afraid of anything!  Well…maybe except for cats. But that doesn't count! It's a trauma, trauma that  was caused because of his idiot father.</p><p><i>'In fact,'</i> she thought. <i>'Everything  is his father's fault! He's even…He's even sick because of him!' </i>A wave of  anger washed her, and she wanted to break something. But then she saw Ranma's  face twitching a bit and she calmed down. She held his hand again.</p><p>He was in the darkness again. <i>'Where is  the light?' </i>Ranma thought. <i>'Where  are you…Akane?' </i></p><p>"I will never leave your side, Ranma. I  promise…" he heard a distant voice. He knew who it was: Akane. The light was  back, but then, after a second, it was all gone.</p><p><i>'Promises.' </i> He thought and then, horrible memories replayed themselves in  his mind.</p><p>"You won't get hurt, boy. I promise." His  father said before throwing his only son into a pit full of starving cats.</p><p><b>"You promised, pop. You promised..." Ranma  said quietly to himself before blacking out from the bites and scratches of the  evil cats. The last thing he saw was their claws full with blood. His blood.</b></p><p><b>"You sure it's safe, pop?" Ranma asked his  father as they climbed the mountains in China. </b></p><p><b>"Don't worry, boy. Everything will be  alright. I promise." Jousenkyo could be seen in the distance.</b></p><p><i>'Promises…' </i>Ranma repeated. All he  could feel now was rage.</p><p><b><i>"Promises my ass!" </i></b>Ranma  shouted and his eyes opened immediately. He was breathing fast and sweating.</p><p>Akane just stared in shock. "R…Ranma?" She  didn't understand what happened. When she held his hand and promised she won't  leave him, he calmed down for a second, and then his face twitched again, and  he groaned and mumbled. Then he started breathing fast, shouted and woke up.</p><p>"Don't ever promise me…" She heard him  saying.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"I feel bad, Akane," he said and tears filled  his eyes.</p><p>"Shhh…You need to rest, Ranma." Akane said  and caressed his cheek gently. "Don't worry. You'll be alright. <i>I promise </i>that  you'll be alright." Only a few seconds later she realized she was promising  again.</p><p>"I asked you not to promise me anything. I  don't believe promises." Ranma said, a bit angry.</p><p>Akane tried to gain his trust again. "It's  just a pneumonia, Ranma. Most don't die because of it."</p><p>"It's just a pit full with starving cats,  Akane." He said quietly. "Just a pit full of cats…" He shut his eyes and fell  asleep.</p><p>Only then Akane understood why he was  shouting when he woke up.</p><p>The morning came and Akane had to leave  Ranma's side for a few hours and go to school. She begged to stay and watch  Ranma, but Kasumi said that school is more important, now that Ranma's fever  broke. Kasumi said that she'll take care of Ranma while she's gone.</p><p>"He'll be fine in a couple of days," she  said. "So you have nothing to worry about. Now go and study."</p><p>In school, it seemed as if time stopped  moving. Seconds past like minutes, minutes like hours…Akane was ever so  grateful when the day was finally over.</p><p>Ranma opened his eyes slowly. He felt much  better today. He lay on his futon, thinking. <i>'I could have died. And I would  have died without telling Akane how I feel. She was so worried about me, too.  It was almost like she actually cared. It would have broke her heart if…if I  left.'</i></p><p>Ranma tried to get up, but he felt so weak  and almost fell. <i>'I need to work my muscles a bit. But Not before I…' </i>He  got up slowly and walked to the living room. '<i>Even if my heart will break.'</i></p><p>"I'm home!" Akane called as she entered.  Everyone did what they always do during this hour of the day, except for…</p><p>"Ranma!" She called happily when she spotted  him watching TV. She ran to him. "Feeling any better?"</p><p>He turned to her and smiled. "Yes," he said.</p><p>"I'm glad." She smiled back at him. "Did you  sleep well? Did you have nightmares?"</p><p>"Nope," he answered and stood up. "Pleasant  dreams only."</p><p>"Really? What did you dream about?"</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath before answering.  "You."</p><p>Akane was speechless. He was dreaming about  her? About his tomboyish, uncute and unsexy fiancé? Or even more important- he  admits it?</p><p>"I think you still have a high fever," she  said cynically. He just stared at her with soft eyes.</p><p>"Wondering why I admitted, aint' ya?" He  asked. She nodded. "Well, I realized life is too short. Like they say: Act  every day as if it's you last- cause it just might be it."</p><p>"But I told you that you'll be alright! I  pro-" Ranma shut her up by kissing her gently on the lips. Then he pulled her  into a hug.</p><p>"I told you what I think of promises." He  whispered in her ear and retreated to the dojo to work up a little, leaving a  shocked Akane behind.</p><p>She brushed her finger on her lips where  Ranma kissed her. "Promises my ass." She whispered.</p><p>It was on a rainy day in November.</p>The End<p>Author's note: So what do you think about  Ranma's quick recovery? ^^; Why are you looking at me like that? ;-; He's strong...</p><p>See? I put some Romance! :D</p><p>Reviews are welcomed. As always ^^;</p>
