</div><p>The Truth Revealed</p><p>By DigiSim</p><p>Sidestory 1: Reminiscing</p><p><i>Happy Birthday K-chan.  I wish we could celebrate together but we both know that is impossible. I  really hate that you left all those years ago but I know that you had no  choice. Death can be cruel as well as kind. I just feel awful every time I  think of you lying in that hospital bed while your body was ravaged by cancer.</i></p><p><i>If only there had been  something I could have done, but sadly there was nothing. I'd never felt so  powerless in all my life. Imagine me, Soun Tendo of the Tendo </i><i>school</i><i> of </i><i>Anything Goes Martial Arts</i><i> being powerless. I think our daughters took  your death harder than I did sometimes.</i></p><p><i>Kasumi tried to  replace you in every aspect except for the bedroom to try and hold on to your  memory. Nabiki drowned herself in the family finances. Akane…well I wish I knew  where she got that temper of hers but I think I have some idea. She just threw  herself into the Art with a vengeance. As for me, if it hadn't been for the  screw-up with the pharmacy and those damn pills then I wouldn't have been such  an emotional wreck. I could have used our friends back then to help me cope.</i></p><p><i>Our friends. Yeah  right. If they had really been our friends then they wouldn't have</i> shunned <i>us like they did just because of our love  for one another. So</i> what <i>if we were  brother and sister. That didn't matter to us. Though you recall our parents  were the worst. It's probably for the best that they kicked us out of the  family and we had to change our names. It's a shame we couldn't have two of our  closest friends come with us. They stayed true to us at least. Too bad they  live where they do and can't visit more often.</i></p><p><i>I have seen them from  time to time though. Just last week they showed up for a visit. The girls love  them both dearly and think of them as family. In a way they are actually. They  always seem to bring a little bit of sunshine with them whenever they visit.</i></p><p><i>As you know, Akane is  engaged to Genma's son Ranma. We tried to hold a wedding for them four months  ago but that fell apart. With all the insanity in Nerima, I'm surprised the  dojo was still standing after the battle. I never knew you could make  okonomiyaki explode. Nodoka was almost hurt in the fight and that made Ranma  extremely angry. I've never seen him that mad before. After his very visible  display of displeasure, everyone backed off on their self-imposed missions of  either killing Ranma or marrying him. For two months things were quiet but then  it all started up again. Akane toned down on her temper towards Ranma however.  If the sounds I heard coming from her room sometimes are any indication we'll  be grandparents around May of next year. </i></p><p><i>Just last month  though, Ranma disappeared. Nobody knows where he went, why he left or if he's  in any danger. I'm not too worried since I know he can take care of himself.  Genma is having trouble sleeping because of Ranma's absence. I think he misses  the morning spars he and Ranma engaged in. Nodoka is also worried for her</i>  'little man among men.' <i>It breaks my heart  to listen to her crying late at night when she thinks no-one can hear her.</i></p><p><i>As for the rest of the  Nerima contingent, the Amazons are still trying to come up with answers to the  mystery. </i><i>Cologne</i><i> spends every waking hour pouring over her  ancient scrolls and tomes for a solution with Mousse always by her side. I'm  not certain but I think they are closer than most people realize. Shampoo is  seen riding all over town on her bike while calling out Ranma's name and making  herself hoarse in the process. She comes by the dojo sometimes for Kasumi's  sore throat remedy.</i></p><p><i>Whenever anyone sees  Ukyo, she always looks as if a breeze blows wrong then she'll burst into tears.  I went to her restaurant recently and she ruined my order three times before  finally getting it right thanks to all her crying. I later realized that I had  inadvertently ordered a </i>'Ranchan special'<i> and she soaked the front of my gi top while she sobbed into my chest  as I comforted her. I guess everybody needs a hug now and again. She fell  asleep in my arms and her waitress Konatsu put her to bed and handled business  for the rest of that day.</i></p><p><i>Akane just mopes  around the house when she doesn't have to go to school or eat meals. She finds  a comfortable place to sit and just strokes her belly while singing softly to</i>  'Ranma junior.' <i>She doesn't show yet  since she's still in her first trimester. If that isn't proof that she has a  bun in her oven, I don't know what is. Well, that and her throwing up every  morning. Nabiki has taken up the Art again. I've heard her going through kata  in the dojo and have even helped her out a little now and again. If she sticks  with it, she</i> <i>could soon be back to  the level she was at when she quit a few years ago. If I remember, she was as  good as Ranma was when he first arrived. Kasumi still puts on a cheerful face  but I can tell it's tempered by grief. She doesn't realize this, but I know  that she and Ranma became lovers quite a while ago. She's also been going  through batteries and chocolate like mad recently.</i></p><p><i>Kodachi Kuno has  enlisted the help of Ryoga. With his natural talent to get lost, he can cover  more ground than Shampoo can on her bike while she's high on caffeine. As for  her brother Tatewaki, all he does is practice his kendo. Their father is no  help though. Koucho Kuno just went to </i><i>Hawaii</i><i> and hasn't sent word of when he'll be back  if at all.</i></p><p><i>The last I heard from  the Master, he was over in Tomobiki looking for a rare tiger-stripped bikini.  He came home a few times looking like he had been electrocuted and burnt with a  blowtorch. He keeps trying though. He also says he's going to keep an eye out  for Ranma when he's not too busy. I hate to say it but every little bit helps.  Even help from little perverts.</i></p><p><i>A young man by the  name of Hikaru Gosunkugi came by once offering his services. He claimed to be  skilled in</i> voodoo <i>of all things. Like  I said, every little bit helps so we accepted his offer. The results were less  than impressive. I hope his hair grows back soon. That's what you get for  wearing lit candles strapped to your head though if you're not careful. I think  he does it to try and commune with the spirit world. A ghost girl that visited  the dojo a while ago named Kogane showed up because of him and accidentally  scared the poor young man. That's why his hair caught on fire.</i></p><p><i>Well hon, there's not  much left to tell you. Everyone prays for Ranma's safe return of course. When  he disappeared, it's like almost everybody in Nerima dropped some pretense of  certain behavior, like removing a mask that hid their true selves. I just wish  you could come back. If you do happen to see Ranma, send him back home. I love  and miss you K-chan. I'll see you next week. Rest well.</i></p><p>Soun Tendo sat kneeling in front of his wife's grave marker  in the local cemetery, paying his respects as usual before he would head back  home. A presence soon made itself known behind him but didn't intrude. Soun  just suppressed a sigh while the person behind him finally spoke after a short  while.</p><p>"You still miss her, don't you." It was more a statement  then a question.</p><p>"That I do old friend, that I do. She was my light you know.  Some days I really wish I could join her." Soun didn't hold back the sigh that  came to his lips this time.</p><p>"You got to have courage. You'll see her one day. But for  now your family needs you even though it doesn't seem like it. How do you think  your girls would feel if they suddenly lost their other parent?" He made a good  case.</p><p>"I know. They wouldn't handle it very well. It's just so  hard sometimes. I'd rather go through the worst my youth had to offer more than  face a new day. Other times, the thought of my daughters is the driving force  that gets me out of bed in the mornings just so I can spend time with them.  They all remind me of K-chan in little ways, Nabiki especially with her  hairstyle."</p><p>Chuckling softly, Soun stood and turned to face a short,  orange Tyrannosaur that barely went past his knees. "You know Tai, Kari was  lucky to have a big brother like you. It's a shame the other Digidestined  treated the two of you like they did, except for Matt and T.K. of course. I  never would have guessed they were lovers. At least they supported you like  Gatomon and I did and still do."</p><p>"Thanks Agumon, that means a lot coming from you. Come on,  Kasumi picked up a couple of watermelons at the market the other day. Let me  treat you to a slice or two." As the two left the cemetery chatting amiably,  back at Kimiko Tendo's, formerly Kari Kamiya's, grave a figure materialized.  The figure was a young woman wearing yellow bicycle shorts with a light brown  belt, a hot pink sleeveless form-hugging Tee with a white stripe running  horizontally across the breast area, long fingerless gloves that covered her  arms all the way to her biceps in the same hot pink color as the shirt, white  calf length socks and high tops also in the same hot pink with the toes being  white. She had her pageboy-styled hair pinned back at her left temple by a red barrette  and had a digital camera hanging around her neck on a strap.</p><p>"He really misses you a lot."</p><p>"I know Gatomon. I miss him too. I'd come back from the dead  for him if it was possible. The way I am now though, I don't think he'd want a  ghost for a wife, let alone a ghost sister." Kari bowed her head as a couple  tears made their way slowly down her pale cheeks.</p><p>The champion-level cat Digimon looked up at her former  partner. "Don't be so sure. I know he still wants you and you've never left his  heart. Tai never got remarried. I think he stays single to honor your memory."</p><p>"That's sweet of him but I can tell it's hurting him too  Gatomon. I just want him to be happy even if it's not with me. Don't think I  don't know about the time the two of you spent alone in the Digital World. He  called out Angewomon's name one night while we were making love but he didn't  notice."</p><p>The cat Digimon just blushed. <i>'Tai, you and your big mouth.'</i> Clearing her throat nervously,  Gatomon asked, "Did it make you mad?"</p><p>With a smirk on her face showing that she was indeed  Nabiki's mother, Kari answered. "A little at first, but then I was flattered  that he was associating me with your Ultimate form. It made me feel like you  and I had a closer bond. I've never done it with Agumon or any of his forms  though." This statement made the two burst out laughing.</p><p>"At least he didn't compare you with my Mega form. That  would have been bad." Gatomon giggled. Kari blinked in confusion at her friend.  "Why would that be? For that matter, what does your Mega form look like? I've  never seen it." The small cat Digimon answered. "Neither has Tai actually. You  know Falkor the Luck Dragon from that movie 'The Neverending Story?' It's kinda  like that."</p><p>A sense of seriousness settled on Kari's face just then.  With the new attitude, Kari seemed to age slowly as her clothes morphed from  'young pre-teen sexpot' to 'respectable woman.' She even acquired a few inches  in height and filled out slightly in all the right areas, looking more like her  mother used to in her early thirties. The only thing that didn't change much  was her hairstyle; it just gained a few inches in length but stayed relatively  the same. As her clothing finished its change into a pair of lemon yellow  slacks, a pale pink blouse and a pair of white tennis shoes, Kari turned her  gaze on the girl cat. "Gatomon, promise me something. If you ever get the chance,  take care of Tai for me."</p><p>With Kari's change, Gatomon changed as well. As her  Digivolution finished, Angewomon raised the helmet covering the upper half of  her face and stared into Kari's eyes with her own ice blue pair. "You know I  would do anything for you Kari. Even in death, you are still and you always  will be my friend." With gentles smiles on both their faces, the two women  quickly and easily found themselves in each others arms and shared a deep kiss  that spoke of a long love affair and an even longer friendship.</p><p>Reluctantly, the two soon ended the embrace and stepped back  slightly from each other. As Kari faded into the ether, a few more tears, this  time ones of joy, slid down her beautiful face. Angewomon felt an ache in her  heart as her oldest friend finally vanished. It was joined by another in her  loins as her mind turned to thoughts of Tai. The problem now was how would she  seduce her best friend's brother. The angel-type Digimon took off into the  morning sky while formulating plans, as well as anticipating their success. She  squirmed a little in desire as her womonhood quickly became drenched.</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Well, that's that. This would have been released a little  sooner if it wasn't for those jerks at Xcel Energy. For some stupid reason they  cut the power to the building for a while. It's bad enough with my constant  cases of writer's block and the phone interrupting when I get into the story. <i>Stupid telemarketers.</i> Then this  happened. Good thing Microsoft Word auto-saved what I had written. My notes were  the only thing that ended up getting lost.</p><p>Anyway, this will be the first of a few sidestories  concerning my very first fic. Of course none of the characters are mine. Just  the ideas used are. I know it will take a while to get to the next one but like  I said, there are too many distractions sometimes. I won't beg but I would like  it if I get a few reviews. It helps to know what you people like about what I  write as well as what you don't. Praise is nice of course but that's not why I  write. I'd like to get paid for writing something but that won't happen anytime  in the near future. I don't write fanfics for profit anyway.</p><p>I don't know when but I will be continuing some of my other  works sooner or later. It takes a bit of time but they are growing into  something I feel good about releasing to the general public. As always,  remember my motto, "My fic, my rules." See you in the funny papers.</p>
