</div><p>The Truth Revealed</p><p>by DigiSim</p><p>It was a peaceful day in the prefecture   of Nerima. Children were laughing,  couples were cuddling in the park, birds were singing, bees were trying to have  sex with them, as is my understanding. It seemed that nothing could ruin this  otherwise perfect day. Guess what, nothing did. It had been six months since  the failed wedding attempt and three months before this point is when Ranma  Saotome disappeared.</p><p>At the Tendo Dojo, Kasumi was making the rounds with her  usual chores. Some would think that the eldest Tendo daughter would be sick of  doing this everyday, and she actually was. She only put up with it because they  were her family. If it wasn't for that fact, she would have told them all to go  *ahem* themselves and left to get a better life. Don't get me wrong, Kasumi  does care for her family. They just get on her nerves sometimes. The thing that  kept her sane has been her secret passion for all things chocolate, and her  sessions with Ranma. With Ranma gone these past three months and Kasumi not  getting any action except for her hands or battery-operated 'friend', the  chocolate was starting to lose its magic.</p><p>Kasumi was in the laundry room, leaning against the running  dryer and thinking back to her first time with Ranma, or at least the event  that lead to it. On a bit of a side note, the Tendos picked up a washer and  dryer set because all of the flying martial artists started to ruin the wash  when it was hanging outside to dry. Kasumi was pleased by this fact because she  really hated to do laundry. When she found out that the dryer made interesting  motions while working, she really enjoyed doing the wash. At least this made  housework bearable and the linens had never been so clean.</p><p>-FlashBack-</p><p>Ranma was alone in his room thinking to himself. Yes, he  does think. A couple days ago, Furinkan had won the acting competition with  selected scenes from 'Romeo and Juliet.' The only reason Ranma had become part  of it all was to win what he thought was a trip to China.  In other words, he wanted a free trip to Jusenkyo. What the prize actually was  turned out to be a party where some fat guy that liked to be called China  would be held at the dojo. The fact that the precise words, being 'to see China',  should have tipped him off, due to the fact that an actual trip was never  mentioned as the prize for winning. Suffice to say, Ranma felt gypped.</p><p><i>'Damn, why does this  kinda stuff always happen to me? It's like the kami are laughin' at me alla the  time. I just wish that I could get my life together. I'm so sick of having to  pretend I'm some sort of brain-dead jock. Jeez, it's become so bad that my  speech keeps slipping even here in my own mind.'</i></p><p>A little known fact was that Ranma actually had a high IQ.  He had learned at an early age to hide his intelligence so the nearly lethal  and always brutal beatings that Genma had given him would stop. Genma always  thought that signs of intelligence were signs of weakness. Genma was an idiot  and an asshole. Years later, he repented in his own way and wished he hadn't  screwed up so badly in the case of his son. Of course, this didn't change the fact  that he still is an idiot and an asshole on occasion, and it is beside the  point, but I digress.</p><p><i>'Maybe I'm never  getting rid of this curse. Maybe I should just learn to accept it. Yeah, and  maybe</i> monkeys <i>will fly out of my  butt.'</i> Ranma sighed and thought that he should stop watching late night TV  from America.  Getting up off the futon, he left his room to go to the kitchen and get a  drink. Because it was a pretty warm day, Ranma purposefully neglected to wear  his usual Chinese shirt, just opting to wear his black pants and the sleeveless  Tee he has on while sleeping.</p><p>Going through the house, Ranma started to suspect he was the  only one at home. Once he entered the kitchen, he found he was mistaken. Kasumi  was standing at the sink, washing vegetables for use in the stir-fry dinner she  was going to prepare later. Some people have said that Ranma is no better than  his cousin from Tomobiki, Ataru. What a lot of people fail to realize is that  like Ranma, Ataru is actually an abused child. His so-called acts of perversion  are actually cries for affection that his mother never gave him and still  refuse to. The only time he can truly be himself is when he is with his only  friend in Tomobiki, Tampopo-san. He likes to think of her as a cross between  the big sister and mother he never had but always wanted. But let's get back to  Ranma.</p><p>Ranma, for all his intellect, was actually struck dumb by  the sight before him. There was Kasumi, in all her angelic beauty, while the  back of her skirt was clinging to her shapely derriere with a combination of  sweat and water mist from the sink. Like her sister Nabiki, Kasumi did toning  exercises; she just wasn't as blatant about it. The fact that she was doing  some butt clenches at the moment stirred something deep within the pig-tailed  boy's heart, as well as his loins. "So this is what it's like to be sexually attracted  to someone. I had always wondered if I would like it. I guess this is a big yes",  Thought Ranma. Hearing Kasumi gasp seemed to snap him out of the trance-like  state he was in. Kasumi was gazing at him with a questioning look on her face.  "Did I say that out loud?" Kasumi nodded. "Are you going to tell Akane?" Kasumi  shook her head, a slight blush creeping up her cheeks, both sets. "So what do  we do now?"</p><p>Kasumi seemed to ponder this question like someone trying to  decide whether or not to cure cancer. When she had her answer she spoke.  "Ranma, we need to talk."</p><p>-End FlashBack-</p><p>From that point on, the two were joined at the hip, pun  intended. Even though the need for secrecy was great, because neither one  wanted to be forced into a marriage that might not work, there was also the  matter of Ranma's <i>'little friends'</i>,  as Kasumi liked to call them. The real reason she called them this was because  she usually thought very 'little' of them.</p><p>At this point, the clothes were dry and Kasumi was not. This  had nothing to do with her excitement earlier, but because the laundry rooms  sink back splashed her. "I wonder if being a water magnet is contagious,"  Kasumi lightly joked to herself. Collecting the newly dried clothes, she set  off into the rest of the house to finish one of her many tedious, to her,  chores.</p><p>Akane was in her room with Nabiki, both of them naked and  making out as usual. They had discovered each other many years ago while  playfully wrestling in the dojo. An accidental brushing together of certain  body parts, then repeated over and over and they were hooked. Even though they  both liked boys that way but had never been with any, they really liked girls  too. Both their father Soun and sister Kasumi knew of their incestuous love  affair and surprisingly approved. This was because Soun had married his sister  Kimiko and Kasumi was happy they were happy. Ranma actually discovered their  relationship quite by accident. He had intended to go ask Akane if she could  help him with his homework one night, all the while keeping up the façade of  the dumb jock. What had happened would better be described in a lemon fic. That  was the night that Akane and Nabiki finally lost their virginity. All thanks to  Ranma. Even though they sometimes pleaded with him to join them for some fun in  either form, he didn't want to get in the way of the love they shared.  Sometimes being noble sucks wind.</p><p>Soun and Genma were in the tea room playing a game of  checkers. Playing their usual game of Japanese chess was getting old and they  both decided to try something new, as well as to not cheat. While they were  playing, they were discussing the current situation concerning a certain  missing martial artist. "I just don't <i>understand</i>  it Tendo. Everything he owns in the world is still in his room. He didn't take  a thing. I'm starting to suspect foul play," Genma intoned gravely.</p><p>"Don't be ridiculous Saotome. I think you've been reading far  too many Sherlock Holmes novels. I do admit it is strange, but this is <i>Ranma</i> we are talking about. He can  surely handle himself no matter the situation." Soun had never been more lucid  than at this point. His iron control on his emotions during his youth was  coming back, slowly but surely. He did have a lapse now and again though.</p><p>"I'm worried about Nodoka. I discussed things with her last  night, and she thinks we should start checking hospitals. I'm inclined to agree  with her." "Saotome, are you okay? I didn't think this would hit you so hard." "I'm  sorry my friend. It's just that I can't stop thinking of my sister. Achika had  some sort of illness befall her and it took the whole family by surprise. I  never got to go to her funeral and my nephew Tenchi was devastated by her loss.  I had no idea she was sick until I called my father Katsuhito the day Ranma and  I showed up here. I just hope there won't be another funeral I'm going to miss.  Actually, I'd rather there was not going to be a need for one."</p><p>"I know what you mean. When I lost Kimi-chan to Ovarian  Cancer, I didn't know what to do. I was nearly catatonic all the time. Some  doctor prescribed this experimental drug for me. It was supposed to be used to  revive coma patients in larger doses. There was a mix-up at the pharmacy and I  received a strange mixture of hormones, testosterone and estrogen supplements.  It wasn't discovered till years later and by then, I had longer hair, a  mustache and mood swings that would make a pregnant woman want to slap me. By  then, the damage was done."</p><p>"I had been wondering about that. But do you have a point to  this story?" "Sorry. As I was saying, my emotions were out of control. Many is  the time I thought of jumping in front of a bullet train and going to join my  wife, but thoughts of my girls always brought me around. I realized that they  would need me, and I couldn't deprive them of both parents. I hate to admit it,  but I didn't do as good a job as I should have. If it hadn't been for the pills  playing hell with my emotions, I would have still been teaching. My point is  that I learned to not give up hope. Thoughts of my daughters were <i>my</i> emotional anchor, and I'm sure that <i>you</i> will find something similar. Just  never give in so easily."</p><p>"Thank you my friend. I feel better now. And now that I do  feel better, I notice that you need to king me." Genma laughed while Soun  looked and discovered his life-long friend, former training partner and, for a  time, lover was correct. Needless to say, Soun was impressed.</p><p>At the Ucchan, things were somewhat busy. Ukyo Kuonji,  okonomiyaki artist supreme was in the zone. Customers would come in, and with  the help of her resident cross-dressing waitress, they would leave stuffed and  satisfied. Tsubasa Kurenai hadn't been seen for months, and he could stay gone,  for all Ukyo cared. Just then, a person that hasn't been seen in Nerima in  quite a while walked into the Ucchan's. Ukyo looked up and started her usual  greeting. "Welcome to Ucchan's, what can I get for you sugar?"</p><p>"I think I'll have a steak and shrimp okonomiyaki," stated  the as yet unidentified customer. "One Surf n' Turf comin' right up. Say sugar,  I don't think I've seen you around before, you new to Nerima?" The customer  shook his head. "No, I've just been away for awhile. My name is Tofu Ono."  "Tofu Ono? Oh yeah, Ranchan told me about you. You were the resident doc before  I showed up here. Dr. Tamashiro took over your business when you left." "That's  correct. I was on my way to the dojo, when I thought I would stop in here and  get some lunch. I would have gone to the Nekohanten, no offense, but they seem  to be closed for the day."</p><p>"No offense taken doc. So why are you headed to the dojo? Visiting  old friends?" Ukyo served up her delicious creation and placed it in front of  the bespectacled man. "Thank you, and yes I am, in a way. I don't know if you  heard, but I used to lose control around someone. I wanted to let them know  that I'm finally cured." Ukyo watched as Tofu ate the okonomiyaki with an  obvious expression of pleasure on his face. He was really enjoying the Japanese  pancake and that made Ukyo glad. "I heard something about it from Akane once. I'm  sorry I missed seeing you dance around town with that skeleton. That must have  been a funny sight. Oops, sorry. Didn't mean to make fun of you."</p><p>Tofu shook his head. "Don't worry, I'm not bothered. Now  that I think of it, it actually was somewhat funny. And the skeleton's name was  Betty-chan, just so you know." Tofu finished off the okonomiyaki, stood up,  placed a wad of Yen on the counter and headed for the door. "Well, that was  wonderful. I haven't had okonomiyaki in years, especially any that good. Thank  you." "No problem doc. Glad to be of service." Ukyo turned to the plate to pick  it up, and could have sworn she heard Ranma's voice say, "I'm sorry Ucchan."  Looking to the doorway revealed it was empty. Turning back to the plate with a  shrug, she picked it up and handed it to her ninja waitress and sometimes only  friend Konatsu Kenzan, then picked up the wad of Yen. Counting the bills, she  discovered that there was close to a million Yen there. Just then Ukyo Kuonji,  master of the school of Okonomiyaki   Martial Arts, felt a chill race down her spine. <i>"Ranchan?"</i></p><p>Over at the closed but not empty Nekohanten, Hikaru  Gosunkugi was inside, sitting at a table slurping down a bowl of ramen. Shampoo  was under the table, slurping something else. Had anyone seen his face just  then and known what was going on under the table, one would wonder if his  expression of ecstasy was from the ramen, or the blowjob from his girlfriend.  Shampoo and Hikaru had been seeing each other in secret for a while now. The  secret was revealed one night during a particularly loud moment of passion in  her room when her great-grandmother Cologne  and fellow Amazon Mousse barged in. The fact that the two intruders looked like  they had been doing the exact same thing as Shampoo and Gos is the only thing  that kept their love a secret from everyone else in Nerima and Hikaru to still  be alive.</p><p>Hikaru had only known about two victims of Jusenkyo back  then, Ranma and Ryoga. One night, after a particularly brutal rainstorm,  Gosunkugi was walking home when he chanced upon a small battered form. It was a  lavender and white colored kitten with its fur styled oddly. It looked like it  had been attacked by a group of very nasty dogs and was on the verge of death.  Gos, in his heart, could never stand to see a small creature suffer. He gently  picked it up, for fear it was still awake and might try to scratch him in  retaliation of a possible attack. Cradling it gently in his arms, he made his  way home.</p><p>For weeks he cared for the kitten. He would sneak some  pieces of fish or bowls of milk into his room all the while tending to its  injuries. Slowly but surely, the kitten was on the mend. One day Mimi, as she  was dubbed by Hikaru because he thought she had cute ears, was trying to find  clues on where she was exactly. If you don't know by now that Mimi is actually  Shampoo, you need to pay attention more. While on the desk, she noticed some  photos. <i>'Damn, why does he have pictures  of that bull dyke Akane? I thought he had good taste, guess I was wrong. Wait,  what's this?'</i> She had just stumbled upon, literally, a single picture of  herself in human form. <i>'Well I'll be. He  does have good taste. I wonder when he took this.'</i></p><p>"Mimi, what are you doing?" Turning her head to look at who  came in, she saw it was her savior Hikaru. Giving out a mew of query and then  turning back to her picture, Gos realized correctly that she was curious. "I  see you've found the picture of my lavender haired goddess of desire. Damn, I  gotta stop hanging around Kuno." Hikaru was slightly startled when the kitten  looked on him with what seemed to be amusement. Deciding to fill her in <i>[not that way you hentais, this isn't 'Gonna  Feel It in the Morning']</i> he picked Mimi up in one hand, the picture in the  other and sat down on his bed. "Okay, where to begin. I know. You see Mimi I  used to enjoy taking pictures. Mainly they would be of Akane because I kind of  had a thing for her. I actually got into picture taking because of my two  favorite artists, Ansel Adams and Sally Mann. I wanted to be an artist like  them. But one day, I saw Akane and something happened. Pretty soon, instead of  pictures of landscapes or of my mom and dad just lounging around the house, I  had nothing but pictures of her. One day, Nabiki tried to bully me to stop  taking pictures of her sister. She said it was because she was just protecting  her but I know she was just protecting her income. She sells photos of her to  Kuno and any other perv that can afford it at school. I don't mean just  students either; I'm talking about the teachers. Some of those people are  really sick."</p><p>Shaking his head in disgust and sighing, he continued.  "Anyway, as I was saying. I kept taking pictures of Akane, I just did it  secretly. One day, I happened to take a picture of someone without knowing it.  I didn't even realize I had the picture till I developed the roll of film. I  soon found out that the girl was a waitress from a nearby restaurant called the  Nekohanten. I went in a couple of times to eat and every time, I was  mesmerized." Shampoo, by this point, was listening intently. "The waitress, her  name is Shampoo, was totally stunning. Sometimes I could barely tell her my  order." Shampoo thought back and remembered those times. She didn't put much  thought into it because she just figured it was the normal reaction she got  from the male customers, and disturbingly from some of the female ones as well.</p><p>"I remember thinking to myself, 'What would a beautiful and  intelligent girl like her ever see in a loser like me?'" Shampoo, moved by the  comment, put her delicate paw on the hand holding her photo and mewed in  support. Looking down, Gos smiled gratefully. "Thanks Mimi. You always know how  to cheer me up." Shampoo mewed back a feline 'You're Welcome' and batted at the  picture. "Oh right, the story. Well, it was around that time that taking  pictures was actually starting to be more of a hobby than a pleasure. I started  to think that I should focus on one of my first loves, medicine. Even when I  was young, I wanted to be a vet." Shampoo looked up and mewed. "Well, a vet is  short for veterinarian, which is a doctor for animals. I've never been able to  stand suffering. When I was small, a baby bird fell out of a nest in a tree in  my back yard and was very hurt. With the help of my mom, I was able to nurse it  back to health. I was so glad when its mother welcomed it back. Ever since  then, any time I see an animal in need, I try to help. That's why I brought you  here." Hearing his story, Shampoo started to feel a strange warmth in her  little kitty chest. You know what they say, you can't help who you fall in love  with, and Shampoo was no exception. Now the only problem was how to reveal the  truth to him without having him end up hating her. She knew that deep down,  that would be more painful than what those stray dogs had done to her. She soon  had a plan.</p><p>Late that night, Gos was relaxing in the furo when the door  opened. Looking up, he saw it was Mimi. "Mimi, what are you doing in here?"  Without giving him time to try to get her to leave, Shampoo leapt into the  furo. Feeling the tingle that signified the change, Shampoo rose from below the  water like Venus did from the sea. Of course, she wasn't riding a clamshell at  the time, but why should we argue about semantics. Gos was stunned. It was a  wonder that his nose didn't shoot blood, but that was because it was busy  somewhere else. "Hikaru-kun, we need to talk." "Sh-sh-Shampoo! How did you get  in here? Wait, where's Mimi? She'll drown if I don't save her!" <i>'Wait, did she just call me Hikaru-kun?'</i>  Placing her hands on his chest and straddling his thighs, she proceeded to tell  him of her curse. "You're serious? All this time, I thought you were a normal  kitten and you end up deceiving me? Why did you do it?"</p><p>Sighing, Shampoo explained. "Hikaru-kun, if it wasn't for  you, I would have died that night. You have shown me nothing but kindness  during my stay here, for the simple reason being you are a kind and caring  person. When you told me that story earlier, I finally realized how grateful I  was to you, not only for saving me, but for just being so caring and attentive.  I know this may seem sudden, but I want you to know that I have fallen in love  with you. If you want me to leave, I will. You will never see me again and I  will never try to bother you. Just know that you will always have a special  place in my heart for everything you've done for me." This revelation took him  by surprise. <i>'She loves me? Wait, she  wants to leave me alone if I'm still mad? I guess she really does love me, if  she is only thinking of my happiness. Hold on, something isn't right here.'</i></p><p>Looking into her shining eyes, Hikaru asked, "Shampoo, since  when can you speak fluent Japanese? I've heard you speak before and you've  never sounded like this." Giving him a small smile that set his heart ablaze,  she replied "Since I went back to my village the first time. When I received my  curse, I learned that Ranma was really a male and not a female like he told me.  To help me adjust to life in Japan,  my great-grandmother gave me a crash course in languages. I just speak like a  bad Viz dub to throw people off and make them think I'm less than I appear."  "What was that sound?" "The fourth wall cracked a little, but that's not  important."</p><p>As the two talked through the night, Hikaru knew he could  forgive her for the deception. The fact that she showed him how much she loved  him, in many positions and repeat performances kind of helped. The next morning,  if Hinako-san used the Go En Satsu on him, he would have died on the spot. He  would have died very happy though. If you're expecting a lemon of what happened  that night, allow me to quote Sam the American-Eagle. "You are all weirdos."</p><p>Over at the Kuno compound, also lovingly dubbed by the  locals as <i>Maniac Mansion</i>, Tatewaki  Kuno was playing with his sword. He was also practicing with his bokken.  Hearing footsteps behind him, he whirled around in what he thought of as a  dramatic display that just made him dizzy and a little nauseous. His vision a  little blurred thanks to his dizziness, Tatewaki started to spew his usual  drivel. "Hold base commoner, know thee now that you have trespassed into the  home of the noble Clan Kuno!" You could just hear the capitals. "You would do  well to retreat like the lowly cur you obviously are lest thou taste of my  mighty blade!" Insert impressive yet pointless lightning strike here. "Very  well, I have given fair warning! Now prepare to be brought low by my…Oh, Ryoga  it's you. I'm sorry; my sight was a little blurry from spinning around so fast.  How have you been?" Vision clearing, Tatewaki could clearly see it was indeed  Ryoga Hibiki, his only true friend.</p><p>"Hey Tate-chan, I've missed you. My but you do look handsome  today. Gimme some sugar." With a naughty grin revealing one fang, pig-boy, I  mean Ryoga, took the kendoist into his arms and they shared a very deep soul  kiss while grasping and massaging each others asses and grinding their crotches  together. You sick yet? <i>No?</i> Good.  After coming up for air, the two gazed lovingly into each others eyes. "So tell  me Ryo-chan, did you find him?" Heaving a sigh and still groping his One True  Love, Ryoga replied. "No, I couldn't find any trace of him anywhere. It's like  he disappeared completely. I thought that I could finally put my family curse  to good use, but I failed." Starting to look down, Tate-chan <i>[don't look at me like that]</i> placed a gentle  kiss on his loves lips. "Don't get depressed sweetie. I know you tried your  best. Maybe something happened that we don't know about. I just wish I knew  what to tell Ko-chan."</p><p>At that moment, Ko-chan <i>[a.k.a.  Kodachi the Black Rose, Kodachi the Botanist from Hell, Kodachi the girl who  likes playing with her gymnast clubs just a little too much, take your pick]</i>  walked in. "No need brother dear, I already heard. Hello Ryo-chan, it's good to  see you again. I'm glad you came back, Tate-chan has been lonely without you."  Giving the lost boy a smile that would make a tumbleweed sprout wildflowers,  she hugged him in a sisterly way. "Oh Ryo-chan, I didn't know you cared. Is  that a wakizashi in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me?" Giggling  at the obviously embarrassed boy, she set his mind at ease. "No need to  explain, I know who that is really for. So did I hear right? You didn't find  Ranma?"</p><p>Sighing again, and finding it strange that he was doing that  a lot lately, he told the both of them of his travels and his findings during  his search for Ranma. He told them of Barrockstadt, the university in the  middle of nowhere. Ryoga went into detail now and again, sometimes while  describing the odd mixture of train station and aviary. When he began to tell about  the greenhouse there, he handed a bottle of Barrockstadt Sauvignon to Kodachi,  describing the stationmaster that had given it to him as a thank you gift and  explaining that the university was the only place known to be able to grow the  extremely rare grapes needed for the wine. He also spoke of his meeting Kate  Walker, the lawyer from New York  and her companion, the automaton named Oscar and their quest to find Hans  Voralberg.</p><p>The lost boy told the Kunos of Ranmas cousins, Ataru and  Tenchi, of finding them and asking them if they had seen or heard from the  pig-tailed martial arts master. Tenchi hadn't even known he had a cousin until  that time, let alone that he was missing. He went on to tell them of the  strange girls in Azabu Juuban and the odd monsters they fought. Showing them  Ranma's picture had elicited strange reactions from the girls. The two long  haired blondes, one having a very odd hair style, thought he was handsome and  would make a wonderful boyfriend, the tall brunette kept stating that he was  her old sempai, yet nobody really listened. The black haired one in red and the  other blonde with short hair accidentally let it slip that he was related to  them. The black haired one claimed she was his half sister; her mother had been  dumped by her father years ago before she was even born. The short haired blond  revealed she was another cousin. The one that kind of reminded Ryoga of Akane,  but why that was remained a mystery to him, mentioned that he looked like he  would enjoy intellectual pursuits. The short cute one stated that he looked  like he would be a good and loyal friend. The last two had the oddest  reactions. The aqua haired one just kept sighing with a contemplative smile on  her face while fingering a pendant that seemed to appear from nowhere. The  green haired one just kept a knowing smirk on her face and subtly nodded now  and again.</p><p>Ryoga went on to tell Tatewaki and Kodachi of the American  city of Angel Grove, and the group  of heroes he fought along side with for a while. Since nothing really  interesting happened there, he didn't go into detail. For hours, Ryoga would  tell story after story of where he had been and the unfortunate news that every  time Ranma was nowhere to be found. After he had finished, the three retired to  what passed for the dining room at the mansion and had dinner. After the meal,  Kodachi left to her room to contemplate all she had been told, and to let the  two love birds get reacquainted. In her bedroom, Kodachi walked over to her  desk and sat down to go over the information she had gathered and add the new  to the old. Charts and graphs littered the surface along with timelines and  police reports, not to mention maps. Pretty soon, her resolve crumbled and she  collapsed in on herself. Falling to the floor, Kodachi curled up into a ball  and started sobbing. "Ranma," she moaned, "where <i>are</i> you? I need my best friend now more than ever, but you're not <i>here.</i> Where did you <i>go Ranchan?"</i> The gymnast, exhausted from grief, fell asleep on the  floor once again while hoping one day good news would come her way.</p><p>Earlier at the Tendo Dojo, Kasumi was walking by the front  door when she heard knocking. Changing her course from the kitchen, she went to  see who it was, hoping against hope that it wasn't a police officer coming to  ask someone to identify a body. Make no mistake, Kasumi had complete faith in  Ranma's abilities but she also knew that there are some things in this world  that a martial artist of Ranmas caliber would have trouble handling. Bracing  herself just in case, she opened the door and was taken completely by surprise  at who it was. "Dr. Tofu, what are you doing here?" Blinking in his own  surprise, Tofu replied, "That's not <i>exactly</i>  the type of welcome I was expecting."</p><p>"I'm sorry but it's just been a trying day. Please come in.  Father and Uncle Saotome are in the tea room." "Thank you." Leaving his shoes  in the usual spot for visitors, Tofu made his way to the tea room. "Soun,  Genma, how have you been?" Looking up from their game, the two men were as  surprised as Kasumi had been. "Tofu, when did you get back to Nerima? How have  things been? Oh where are my manners, please sit." Thanking Soun, he did so.  Genma noticed that the young doctor wasn't acting like a clown like he usually  did when near Kasumi. "I see you've been cured lad. How did you do it?"</p><p>Soun had wondered about the calm man, but hadn't wanted to  mention anything because it might have seemed rude. Genma actually had very  little manners at times and it showed. "That's why I'm here. Is everyone else  here?" At that question, Akane and Nabiki wandered in, both with a healthy glow  about them and very satisfied smiles on their faces. Seeing Tofu in the room  made them become slightly nervous, as if they felt guilt but didn't know why.  Tofu nodded in acknowledgement to them. Akane and Nabiki sat at their usual  places while Nodoka came in from the kitchen with Kasumi, one carrying the tea  things, the other carrying a tray of snacks. "It's good to see you again  doctor, I trust you've been well?" "As well as can be expected Mrs. Saotome."  Hearing his somewhat cryptic answer, Nodoka frowned slightly in thought. <i>'I wonder if he suffered a tragedy of his </i>own<i> recently.'</i></p><p>Kasumi had been wondering why the young man hadn't been  acting silly like he usually did when she was near. <i>'I guess it must be serious if he isn't trying to make me laugh like he  always does.'</i> Okay, so sometimes Kasumi is oblivious. Setting down the  trays, Nodoka and Kasumi took a seat after serving everybody and themselves.  After a few minutes of idle chatter, Tofu cleared his throat to get everyone's  attention. "I'm sure you are all wondering why I'm here. Well, I came here  today to clear up a few things and let you know about my past." Seeing that  everyone was paying attention, he began.</p><p>-FlashBack-</p><p><i>Many years ago, my  parents Biin and Kin Ono found me in </i><i>Nerima</i><i>Park</i><i>. I was unconscious and covered with burns. My father, under orders  from my mother, picked me up and carried me to the nearby clinic. I'm told it  was quite a site to see, a man in his thirties carrying an unconscious  teenager. I woke up at the clinic with no memory of who I was and only a  rudimentary knowledge of martial arts. I don't even know how I had gotten the  burns, which had destroyed a good portion of my hair. It was soon decided that  I would go with Biin and Kin seeing as they felt responsible for my well being.  They later told me that the way they found me is exactly how they found my  older sister Yoko, except instead of burns she had what looked to be ice  covering parts of her body. Since I had no where else to go and I felt I could  trust the two of them, I obviously went with them to live in </i><i>Hokkaido</i><i>.</i></p><p><i>As the years passed,  my memory stayed out of reach. The only person I felt close to, aside from my  parents was Yoko. It was like she and I were two parts of the same whole. One  day she told me that she had fallen in love with a British singer named John  Lennon. I don't know why to this day, but I felt betrayed. I was of course  happy for her, but I knew we were drifting apart. We've kept in touch over the  years. During the early 80's when some creep shot John, I was there to help  Yoko pick up the pieces of her heart. The fact that she was made a widow in  such a brutal fashion almost totally destroyed her. My nephew has never fully  recovered either.</i></p><p><i>While I was growing  up, I decided to try my hand at the healing arts. My father Biin had been the  doctor in Nerima for a time and our family owns the building. He passed on his  practice to a young man named Kusanagi and had been visiting him with my mom  the day they found me. It seemed that I was some sort of learning prodigy. No  matter what subject it was, I was able to absorb it. This talent helped me  through school and later college. After graduating, I was told that to complete  my studies, I was being sent to see an old family friend named Katsuhito  Masaki. Mr. Saotome, you know this name?</i></p><p>-Pause FlashBack-</p><p>"Yes, that is the name of my father. I never knew you had  met him." Giving a slight smile, Tofu said, "He helped me quite a bit with my  studies. I learned many different shiatsu and chiropractic techniques from him.  He also thrashed me soundly whenever we practiced kendo. There are a few times  I almost got the better of him, but not many." Laughing boisterously, Genma nodded.  "That's him all right. I never thought that had been you. It seems my sister  had a bit of a crush on you even though she was seeing Nobuyuki. Pardon my  interrupting, please continue."</p><p>-Resume FlashBack-</p><p><i>As I was saying, I  stayed at the Masaki shrine for a couple of years before I went back to </i><i>Hokkaido</i><i>. My father was proud of how well I had  turned out. Like I mentioned earlier, Masaki-sensei taught me shiatsu and  chiropractic techniques but he taught me how to read auras as well. I was already  gifted with this skill yet he helped me develop it further. I took over Dr.  Kusanagis practice here in Nerima and prepared for my first patient. Imagine my  surprise when my first patient turned out to be a frantic father carting around  his daughter in his arms and wailing like a banshee. Pardon my language, but  the man looked like he was about ready to shit himself silly. His daughter  seemed to be the more level headed of the two. I calmed the man down and  learned that his name was Soun Tendo. My actual patient was Akane. She had  stumbled and gotten a small splinter in her finger and for some reason, Soun  had a panic attack.</i></p><p><i>After all was said and  done, I finally introduced myself to him and explained that I was just starting  my practice. He was so grateful to me, he sang my praises to anyone who would  listen and to many who thought he was a bit out of it. Because of this word of  mouth advertising, business flourished. Unfortunately, every silver lining has  a cloud, and my cloud and silver lining were one and the same, Kasumi.</i></p><p><i>Everytime she would  show up, or even just say hello to me, I would turn into a blithering idiot. It  took me a while to realize that I was in love with her, but why I kept acting  the way I did whenever she was around utterly baffled me. That's right Kasumi;  I'm in love with you. I tried everything I could think of to control my  actions. Nothing helped. It nearly drove me to drink on a few occasions. I know  my mother had told you that my father had acted the same way when they were  young, but that really didn't help me. That is until one night when I  remembered a conversation I had with him.</i></p><p><i>He told me of the  madness and why it occurred. He was deeply in love with my mother at the time,  but he was also in love with another woman. It was his guilt that made him act  strange, as a sort of attempt to push her away so she wouldn't be hurt if he  chose the other woman. She just thought he was being silly to make her laugh  and fell deeply in love with him more. He eventually got up the emotional  strength needed to make a choice and was able to control his attacks. Even  though I remembered this talk with him, it didn't actually help me, because I  didn't know who else I was in love with, thanks to my amnesia.</i></p><p><i>As the years went by,  I continued in my practice and met many interesting people. One day, I received  a letter from my mother telling me to come home. Age was finally catching up  with her, and she wanted her son and daughter with her in her last days. Her  last days turned out to be months. Seeing Yoko after so long was like a great  weight had been lifted from my heart. The fact that we were both there because  of what was happening to mother put a somewhat somber mood on our reunion.</i></p><p><i>One night, I couldn't  sleep and went to check on my mom. She was still awake and reading a book about  big hipped women. We talked for a while then she asked me a question that kind  of threw me for a loop. She had asked if I had remembered that I was adopted,  and I answered that I had actually forgotten. She then told me to go into her  closet and remove the box labeled 'Memories' and bring it to her. Once I had  done so, she took out an item that utterly smashed through my amnesia right  then and there. Yoko, who had been standing in the doorway at the time, saw the  item as well and fainted.</i></p><p>-End FlashBack-</p><p>Sighing and massaging the bridge of his nose, Tofu continued  with his tale. "It had obviously been repaired, but it would never work the way  it had been intended ever again. All of a sudden, everything made sense to me.  My madness, the ease I felt the first day I met Ranma, even when I had hired  Genma in panda form to work in the clinic. Yoko, who also had amnesia didn't  take her memories returning as well as I had. She nearly had a breakdown as bad  as when John was shot."</p><p>Taking a sip of his now cold tea, Tofu let what he said sink  in. Finally Nabiki asked, "So who was it you were in love with? Did you figure  that out?" Looking at her directly in the eyes he said, "It was you and Akane."  Everyone else gasped at that. "While I was in school, I had somehow gotten into  the habit of coloring my hair. I changed it from it's natural black to brown  and I also started to wear glasses even though I have no real use for them."  While he had said this, Tofu took off his glasses and placed them on the table.  Anyone could plainly see the lenses were nothing but common glass. "I guess I  did it because I felt there was some sort of need. Yoko also colored her hair.  Her original color was a bright red that was very noticeable. The both of us  also wore colored contacts." Removing them, Tofu also pulled out an item that  everyone around the table recognized right away, the Nanban mirror, and placed  it next to his discarded glasses. It had an even split right down the middle  and had been taped together. His now blue eyes shining, he gazed at his captive  audience and spoke a phrase that hadn't been heard since a red haired girl and  a panda visited the Tendos. "I'm Ranma Saotome. Sorry about this."</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Now how's that for an ending? I think it's safe to say that  I own none of the characters in this fic. If I did, I wouldn't be living where  I am now. The only thing I own is the ideas I used. This was just going to be a  fic about Tofu's past but it ballooned and I couldn't stop it. I also realized  I didn't want to. I've actually revised this very slightly if you can tell. For  instance, I added the reason why Kate Walker and the automaton Oscar are  traveling together. If you've played the PC game 'Syberia' you'd know who they  are. Sooner or later I'm going to go snag the sequel for myself.</p><p>Anyway, I hope that people still like this story. Sure it  changed very slightly but it's still basically good. I think. As always,  remember my motto, "My fic, my rules." See you in the funny papers.</p>
