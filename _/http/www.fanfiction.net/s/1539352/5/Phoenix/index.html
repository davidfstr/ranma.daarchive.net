</div><p>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer</p><p>Ranma sat down in front of her husband's computer,  not really knowing what to write.  She had  a creative writing assignment in her English class, and creativity wasn't  exactly her strong point, except when it came to the Art.  It didn't help her that the Roman keys made  her nervous.  It also didn't help that  her husband was on alert status for the weekend, and couldn't help her.  "Aw hell, might as well tell my life  story."  She chuckled to herself, as she  began to hunt and peck her way across the keyboard.  "I doubt anyone is going to believe me anyway."</p><p>My name's Reiko Sakai, and I'm a martial  artist.  I'm also married to the oldest  lieutenant in one of the fighter squadrons at Misawa Airbase.  I've been training under my father for ten  years straight.  Unfortunately, he's a  better sensei than father; and his training methods, while unorthodox and  border on the deplorable and highly dangerous, especially for the student, are  highly effective.</p><p>Some of my father's techniques included having me be  chased by timber wolves to teach me to run faster; tying me to the back of a  freight train to raise my endurance; teaching me to get around quicker, and I  actually enjoy and use that particular skill; leaving me to fend for myself in  the woods while he'd be in town getting drunk and stuffing his face to teach me  how to survive; oh, he'd sometimes forget to pull his punches when we'd spar,  especially if he were drunk.  He'd turn  anything into training—even eating.  I  think he did that just to feed his fat belly.</p><p>There was one technique though that really takes the  cake, though.  When I was six, my father  "found" a technique manual for the Neko-ken, or "Cat Fist".  It's this supposedly unbeatable technique,  but there's a draw back.  To learn the  technique, the student (that was me) must be tied up with fish products and  thrown into a pit of cats, starved for three to four days.  The student then either learns it by  reverting to a cat-like state, or dies.</p><p>The problem with the Neko-ken is that it's been  banned for generations, because it drives the student insane.  The student, should they survive, tends to  be trapped in a feral cat-like state, or develops such an intense fear of cats  that by being surrounded by them triggers the technique.</p><p>Of course, I didn't learn it the first time, so Pops  threw me in several more times, with different fish products.  I finally learned it; and now I can't stand  to be around cats for any extended amount of time.  If I am, the fear becomes so intense that I black out, and I'll  revert to the cat-like state.  I found  this out after spending some time with Amazons in the hinterlands of China.</p><p>The other thing Pops did was a never-ending search  for the perfect training grounds for our school.  I guess I should mention our school of martial arts.  It's called Musabetsu Kakutou Sakai-ryu, and  there are very few practitioners of the school.  Loosely translated the name means "Indiscriminate Grappling" or  "Anything Goes".  What that means is  that when we get into a challenge, we learn and then use our opponent's attacks  against them.  Our school also uses  taunts to enrage our opponent and make them loose their focus.  Another thing our school specializes in is  aerial combat.  We can launch into the  air and fight as comfortably as if we are on the ground; from a standing start  I can leap 20-30 feet into the air.   Pops was great for teaching how to enrage someone; he'd do it to me  multiple times when we'd spar, call me weak and girly.  There is one other thing I guess I should  mention.  I wasn't always a girl; in  fact when we started the training trip and for most of the trip, I was a boy.</p><p>Like I said earlier, Pop's was always looking for  the perfect training grounds.  We  wandered all over the world training with martial arts masters, learning their  techniques.  Well, our wandering took us  into China, and deep into the hinterlands of that nation, to the Cursed  Training Grounds of Jusenkyo.  When we  arrived, the one hundred or so springs were shrouded in a mist that made them  seem less ominous than they actually are.   Pops and I jumped on to a bamboo stake located in different pool, launched  into the air and began sparring.</p><p>The PRC provides a guide at the Springs to warn  visitors against the dangers of falling into one.  He started babbling in pidgin Japanese about the dangers when I  knocked my old man into one.  He had  just started saying something about the Spring of Drowned Panda when my father,  now in his cursed form of a giant panda leapt out of the pool.  I was so shocked, that Pops got in a clean  shot in.  I flew back, twisted around,  and grabbed on to a bamboo pole in a different pool.</p><p>The pole snapped, and in I fell with a splash.  I surfaced and felt different.  Looking down, I saw what happened.  Well, hell yeah, I was in shock and passed  out.  Next thing I know, I'm in the  Guide's hut.  The Guide looked at me  with an apologetic look on his face.   "Sorry, Mr. Customer," the Guide said, "you fall into Spring of Drowned  Girl.  The reverse of hot water does not  work; the curse is permanent."</p><p>At that point, I screamed, and ran out of the  hut.  I ran for most of the day and that  night until I collapsed from exhaustion.   For the second time in as many days, I woke up to an unfamiliar ceiling,  but this time surrounded by women.  I  would have made some sort of comment, or tried to fight my way out, not that I  liked fighting women.  This old troll  pogoed up to my cot and looked at me.  I  tried to sit up, but the local healer wouldn't let me, until she felt I was  ready to.  She spoke first in Mandarin.  When I indicated I didn't understand her,  she switched to Japanese.  "You should  consider yourself lucky, young lady, that our patrol found you and not the  Musk.  They have no compunctions about  turning you into one of their breeding stock."   I shuddered on the cot, I was still a guy inside, and that sort of thing  frightened the piss out of me.  Yeah,  Pops tried to make me a "man amongst men" by teaching me Anything Goes Hentai  Martial Arts when I was 15 at a Bangkok brothel did make me lose my virginity,  and it was fun, but I didn't learn any techniques from it.  At the time, because of my condition, I  really didn't appreciate what I had learned in Bangkok happening to me.  Oh yeah, Pops got caught by the Thai police  and thrown in jail for prostitution, since money changed hands.  The girls of the Bangkok Chicken Ranch  adopted me until Oyaji was released on his own recognizance.  Of course, we weren't supposed to leave the  country, but we did.  I think there's an  international warrant out for his arrest.   "What's you're name, child," the old troll asked me.</p><p>"R-Reiko Sakai," I replied, a little  hesitantly.  All these feelings and  different sensations, and whatnot had my system on permanent overload.</p><p>"Hm…what were you doing on the trail up from  Jusenkyo?"</p><p>I sighed, and began my tale of woe.  Of how my father took me away from my home  when I was 6 on a ten-year training trip, the techniques I was taught, of the  places we've trained at.  I finished  with our "adventure" yesterday at Jusenkyo, and how I wound up as a girl.</p><p>The Elder turned and said something in  Mandarin.  I guess it was an order,  because the guards in my hut turned and left, but the healer remained.  She then looked back at me, regarding me  almost as a cat does the canary.  "I am  Kuh Lon, an Elder of the Joketsuzoku Amazons.   I know all about Jusenkyo, child, particularly the Spring that you had  the misfortune of falling in.  Balm,  here," she gestured to the healer, "is one of those unfortunates that fell  in.  She was a doctor, and was adopted  into our tribe.  Many of our warriors  and non-warriors were cursed in that particular spring.  If you are willing, Reiko, I will petition  the Council to adopt you into our tribe."</p><p>"I…I'll think about it," I told her, as I lay back  on the cot.  To be perfectly honest, I  didn't know what to expect.  I was a  girl—the creature my panda of a father told me was weak—being offered a  membership into a tribe of women warriors.</p><p>Balm looked at me.   "Your ki reserves are still extremely low.  You need to rest, young one.   I will have some food and drink brought it."  I nodded and closed my eyes…</p><p>Only to be poked what seemed like a minute  later.  A young Amazon with lavender  hair was standing by my bed, a tray loaded with food in her hands.  "Ranma want food, yes?"  She asked in broken, pidgin Japanese.  I nodded and she set the tray down.  Taking up the chopsticks, I began to devour  my food at Sakai speed.  Well, that was  until I noticed my father wasn't there trying to steal my food.</p><p>I may have said it earlier, but I'll state it  again.  My old man turned anything into  a training exercise—even eating.  If I  wasn't fast enough, he'd steal food out from under my nose.  It taught me how to be faster, and improved  my hand and eye coordination, but I usually wound up tasting my food after I'd  eaten it.</p><p>And this training was apparent on the young Amazon's  face while I was eating.  With a  sheepish grin, I apologized.  "Sorry…"</p><p>"Xian Pu."</p><p>"Shampoo."</p><p>"No, Xian Pu."</p><p>"Shampoo."  I  grinned at her, because I couldn't get the pronunciation of her name in  Mandarin down.  Shampoo saw my smile and  started laughing.  I guess they say  laughter is the best medicine, because when I started laughing, I began to feel  a lot better.</p><p>I spent close to a year, something like nine or ten  months, with the Amazons, and it was probably the best thing that happened to  me until recently.  I told Cologne that I  wanted to be just an honorary member, not a full member.  I explained to her that I still had family  in Japan, and wasn't ready to give it up yet.   The Elder understood, and in a brief ceremony calling upon their  goddesses, I became an honorary Amazon and a near-sister to Shampoo, mainly  because I got the somewhat lonely Amazon warrior to lighten up, and look at  things from a different perspective.   Heck, I didn't even know I was going to be named her near-sister; it  came as a surprise when Shampoo gave me the Kiss of Sisterhood.  But it's nice that I have a sister that I  can talk to, even if it is just writing back and forth.  I wonder how she handled Mu Tsu.</p><p>The time was well spent after the ceremony.  They taught me, not only their particular  brand of martial arts, but also who I had become.  But at the same time, some of the more rigid Amazons, some who  still thought that I was a guy underneath my appearance, tried making me do  menial labor, more appropriate to a slave.   Apparently to them, my status as an honorary Amazon wasn't worth camel  spit.</p><p>Which was something else that annoyed me—the way men  were treated.  But there was no way I  could change a system like that, and even Cologne, the most liberal of the  Elders when it came to males, would be unable to affect a change in the status  quo, so there would be nothing changed.   Some of the more liberal, I guess would be the best word I can use,  Amazons, particularly those that were cursed liked me, treated the males with a  little more respect.  I tried my hardest  to keep an even keel and not piss of those Elders that wanted Cologne to suffer  a loss of face.</p><p>Balm became my mentor in a number of  things—especially when it came to that time of the month.  I was freaking out when the bleeding  started; I had no idea about a menstrual cycle, or periods.  She calmed me down, told me what to do, and  gave me, in better detail than my old man, a lesson in sex ed.  Sure, I learned a lot at that brothel in  Bangkok, especially after Pops was in jail, but that was as a guy.  For a girl, it was different.  I still get a little queasy when I remember  Balm's training.</p><p>Not only was she my mentor, but Balm also became an  almost surrogate mother to me.  There  were nights that I couldn't sleep, especially right after I was cursed.  Pops raised me to be a man among, and the  shock to my ego was too much for me to handle.   I would cry throughout the night, and Balm would be there to comfort me;  let me cry myself out on her shoulder.   She would tell me that she went through the same emotional turmoil that  I was going through.  I put a brave  front up during the day, but nights were when I could let my emotions out, when  Balm and I were alone in the hut we shared.   Slowly, though, Balm got me to express myself, and my emotions to the  outside world.</p><p>Like I said, it was time well spent, so it was  difficult when I left to go home.  I  wanted to find my mother, to talk to her.   At the time, I didn't know about the seppuku contract I supposedly  signed when I was 6.  Kuh Lon arranged  for a passport and visa through the Japanese Embassy, since Pops and I swam  across the Sea of Japan</p><p>I ran into Mom near one of the malls in the Juban  district of Tokyo.  I didn't know how to  approach her, but I eventually did.  It  was hard for the both of us to admit that I was once her son.  But I wasn't happy with what her decision  was.</p><p>Sitting in the food court, she showed me the  contract that my father and I signed and told me that I two choices for failing  to be a man amongst men—appease family honor and commit seppuku, or be disowned  and expelled from the Sakai clan.  Very  harsh decisions for me to make, but my family has a samurai lineage that goes  back to the Tokugawa era, so honor is everything to my family.</p><p>I told my mother that I'm too young to die; that I  had a full life to live ahead of me.   "Very well," she told me.  "Then  my son is truly dead to me.  Good day, madam."  With that, she stood and walked out of the  food court.</p><p>I left Tokyo and wandered around the country until  early December.  It was hard for me  during that time to find food, let alone work.   The various Shinto shrines and temples that dotted the countryside  provided me food and shelter for work at the shrine.  It wasn't the best of arrangements—there were times that I had to  leave in the middle of the night because the priest was a pervert, and I didn't  want my body violated.</p><p>When Pops and I were on our training trip, we lived  off the land.  But we at least had a  tent.  When I left the Joketsuzoku, I  didn't exactly have a tent with me, but Kuh Lon had provided enough funds for  me to make it to the nearest city with a Japanese consulate, so that I could  retrieve my passport and visa, and to arrange for transportation back to  Tokyo.  But not enough for much camping  equipment.</p><p>By the time I reached Misawa, I'd taken to living  under bridges, in culverts, abandoned buildings, basically someplace that I  could get overhead cover to avoid getting raped.  So I was getting sick.  By  the time the first snows hit northern Japan, I wasn't feeling all that  well.  Heck, I was probably getting  pneumonia, I wasn't feeling all that well anymore.  I'd taken to living in the doorway of the old building just off  base.</p><p>My husband found me in the doorway, ready to give up  the ghost.  I was feverish, coughing up  green stuff, I wasn't thinking right.   But when he helped me out, he did it out of concern for my  well-being.  It was like he was a knight  in shining armor out of a cheesy romance novel or <i>shoujo</i> anime.  I apparently passed out, and the next thing  I know, I'm warm, lying in a bed.  That  threw me for a loop.  I opened my eyes,  and the first sight that greeted me was a B-29 being attacked by an A6M.  I closed them and reopened them.  It turned out that my husband was a model  builder.  I was in an unfamiliar room,  naked.  I was about to scream like there  was no tomorrow, when something told me I should just double check.  Warm?   Yes.  Dry?  Definitely.</p><p>I woke my savior up, using a little known Amazon  technique—yelling in his ear.  We talked  for a while; I explained why I was in the dire situation that I was.  He made an offer that I really couldn't  refuse.  Although, there was still that  little bit of male sitting in the back of my head, I protested, stating I was  still a guy.</p><p>Patiently, he explained the situation, based on what  I had told him.  And I realized that I  should have remembered that, since I'd been like this for over a year at this  point.  I still held on to the foolish  notion that some how I could regain my lost masculinity.  A part of my mind, the one that Balm and Kuh  Lon grew and nurtured, was reminding me that the curse was permanent; that I  couldn't regain what the lone permanent spring that doesn't kill the recipient  of the curse, like Nissanniichuan, the Spring of Drowned Nissan Pathfinder*.</p><p>We spent that first day together shopping, stopping  at the…he called it the chow hall, but it was more like a cafeteria that what I  expected a chow hall to look like, for lunch first.  As I showered when we got back to his quarters, I finally made  the decision to let my past life die in the Springs; that it was time for me to  embrace the woman that I was.  Now, I  wasn't gay or anything when I was a guy.   Heck, the girls at Chicken Ranch were quite impressed with my stamina,  and a couple of the girls who were Japanese gave me the nickname of "ran ma".  But it's just that I've spent the past year  as a girl.  Balm explained to me that different  hormones and chemistry would cause me to become more female over time.  She even explained a bit of her history to  me; that she had a successful practice in the Nerima ward of Tokyo, as a  chiropractor and general practitioner, along with a few esoteric  specializations in acupuncture and moxibustion, until she left the ward to find  her center.  Which was how she wound up  cursed by Jusenkyo, and continued to practice her medical arts for the Amazons.  That was three years ago, and two years ago,  Balm married Da Ger, a promising apprentice under the village wordsmith Ra  Zor.</p><p>When I got out of the shower and dressed, the  Lieutenant asked me to marry him.  He  was so cute as he did it on bended knee, waffling as he made his speech.  For a man almost twice my age, he sure is  easily flustered.  But I love him  anyway.</p><p>We had a quick wedding; I got my new identity and  put my past behind me.  Except for my  martial arts.  That's something I'll  never give up.  And now I have an added  surprise for my darling husband.  He  wanted to learn my family martial arts, so I started him out with a series of  beginning katas.  Well, I sort of pushed  him a little too far, and wore him out.   So while he was recuperating in the tub, we…well I won't go into that,  but suffice to say in about eight months, we're going to have a new member to  the family.  And I could care less if I  don't meet my mother's expectations about me being a "man amongst men"; I'm  going to be a mother.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>* This  particular spring was found on Brian Drozd's webpage.
