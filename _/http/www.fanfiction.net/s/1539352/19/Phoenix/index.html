</div><p>AN: Crossovers galore! And the Disclaimers are: Ranma is, of course, the property of Rumiko Takahashi; Kei Nagase is from Ace Combat 5, and belongs to Namco; Captain Kirk, well no explanation is really needed there; Sailor Moon and friends are the property of someone else entirely. All I'm doing is perverting them for my own use and fun.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Your typical, nondescript Chevy GSA van sat idling outside the Marx residence, waiting for it's passengers. Or, more specifically, one passenger. Saburo was saying good bye to his girlfriend. And dragging it out, much to the displeasure of his father. Of course Marx was wondering why they had to fly commercial, as opposed to military, and came to the conclusion that General Cortalano was having the last laugh. "Saburo," Marx called, "if you don't hurry, we're going to miss our flight."<p>"Yes sir," he replied. He looked in Jenny's sad doe eyes. "I'm going to miss you so much, Jenny."</p><p>"I know, Saburo," she replied. "Email me your address when you get it; I'll write often."</p><p>"So will I," he said.</p><p>Jenny, knowing her boyfriend really didn't like open displays of affection, hugged Saburo, and kissed him.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>With his family getting settled into their apartment in Juuban, Marx was getting settled into his office at the Embassy. He'd been introduced to his staff, and found calling his aide "yeoman" odd. But then, he'd never had a petty officer for an aide before. The JDA liaison, JASDF Major Kei Nagase, seemed like a cold fish; Yeoman Rand assured her new boss that the Major would eventually warm up.<p>There was a knock at the oak door, and thinking it was his aide, bade them to enter. "Jesus, Scooter, it's been what- 15 years," Ambassador Brian "Doctor" Cobb said.</p><p>Marx turned and looked at his former wingman. "Doc! How the hell are you!" He grabbed the Ambassador in a bear hug. "When did you become a diplomat?" Marx broke the manly hug, and offered Doctor a seat, while he sat behind his desk.</p><p>"About two years ago. It pays to support the right people. How are Ranma and Saburo?"</p><p>"They're fine. We had twins ten years ago. Chris is becoming an almost spitting image of me, and Nodoka looks just like her mother. Saburo was a 4.0 GPA back home, beating both me and his mother."</p><p>"Scooter, I remember you telling me that you graduated near the bottom of your class in high school. Anyone with half a brain can beat your GPA."</p><p>Marx rolled his eyes at the Ambassador. "Thanks a lot, Doc," he growled. "Anyway, Saburo takes to schoolwork with the same intensity he takes to his martial arts—to be the best there is."</p><p>"Glad to hear it. Oh, congratulations on the Silver Star, by the way."</p><p>"Thanks. Doc, I need to know: did you put the request in for me?"</p><p>Cobb looked at his friend. "No. I put a request in for someone fluent in Japanese, so they can talk plainly with the Self-Defense Forces. I never assumed that they would send you."</p><p>"That son of a bitch…" Marx growled, thinking about MG Cortalano.</p><p>"Don't dwell on it, Scooter. Besides, you're back among friends. It'll be just like Misawa, just without the flying."</p><p>"Thanks, Doc. Hey, speaking of Misawa, how about we round up two more for a game of poker tonight?"</p><p>"Ah, that brings me to the other reason why I'm here. We're hosting a reception for the new Chinese Ambassador tonight. Full monkey suit and spouse. Receiving line starts at 2000 hours."</p><p>"Great," Marx muttered. "I'll let Ranma know. It's good to see you again, Doc."</p><p>"Same here, Scoot. See you tonight."</p><p>As Cobb closed the door behind him, Marx picked up the phone and prayed that Ranma had NTT hook the phone up…then set the receiver back down as he realized he didn't have his home number. He picked the receiver back up and dialed his aide. "Yeoman Rand, have my driver bring the car around."</p><p>"Yes sir."</p><p>Marx hung up and grabbed his battered A-2 and headed out of the office. "If anyone is looking for me, tell them I'm out for the rest of the day. And if it's really important, have them speak to Lt. McConnell."</p><p>"Aye sir," Rand replied to the rapidly retreating back of her new boss. "He's definitely not like Captain Kirk," she muttered as she returned to her paperwork.</p><p>"I'm home," Marx called, exchanging shoes for slippers.</p><p>"You're home early," Ranma said, as she picked a piece of Styrofoam peanut out of her hair.</p><p>"There's formal reception tonight at the Embassy for the new Chinese Ambassador."</p><p>"I guess you found out about it before you got here?"</p><p>"Yep. I would have called but, I didn't know if NTT came by and hooked the phone up. And even if they were, I don't know the number."</p><p>"They were just here," Ranma said, as she handed her husband a tag with the phone number on it. "What time's the reception?"</p><p>"Eight. Have you unpacked the formal stud yet?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Remember, we packed those with your uniforms and the rest of the clothes."</p><p>Marx kissed his wife. "You're a blessing. I'm going to start getting ready. Oh, by the way, guess who my boss is?"</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"My old wingman, Brian Cobb," Marx said, chuckling.</p><p>"My God, it's a small world. How is he?"</p><p>"He's still the same old Doc from Misawa."</p><p>"Go get cleaned up. I'll join you in the furo in a few minutes," Ranma said. Marx gave his wife a lecherous grin as he went into the bathroom. "Pervert," she muttered. "Saburo!"</p><p>Their eldest son came into the living room, covered in dust and packing materials. "Yeah, Mom?"</p><p>"Your father and I have a formal reception tonight at the Embassy, so you'll be in charge."</p><p>"Okay. Do you know when you'll be home tonight?"</p><p>"No, but don't be surprised if we're home late. Are you ready for school tomorrow?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess so," he muttered.</p><p>Ranma smiled at her son. "Just like me when I started school," she said with a chuckle. "The landlord was gracious enough to leave the takeout menus from the last tenant."</p><p>"Ok, Mom."</p><p>Marx and Ranma made it back to the Embassy with just barely enough time to spare. Dashing into position on the receiving line, they received frosty looks from the career diplomats. The Colonel gave the same look right back to them, showing his disdain for these paper pushers. "Ladies and Gentleman," Cobb's Chief of Staff announced, ending further staring contests. "Her Excellency, the Chinese Ambassador. The double doors opened. Ranma's eyes went wide when she saw who the Ambassador was.</p><p>Cobb walked beside Shampoo, introducing his staff and their spouses to her. "My military attaché, recently transferred from the United States, Colonel…"</p><p>"Christopher Marx. It's been a few years, Colonel," Shampoo said. "Sister, how are you doing?"</p><p>"Very good, sister," Ranma replied. "Let's talk, later."</p><p>Shampoo nodded, and let Cobber continue escorting her through his staff.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>At the same time the receiving line started at the Embassy, Saburo was deciding what to order for dinner. "Eh, this'll work," he said, finally deciding. He called Chris and Nodoka in. "What kind of okonomiyaki do you want?"<p>Chris looked over the menu. Even if their father couldn't read kanji, Ranma insisted that their children be able to read it from an early age. "I want a seafood!" Nodoka replied coolly that she wanted a vegetarian.</p><p>"Ok." He picked up the phone, and dialed.</p><p>"Ucchan's. What can I get ya?"</p><p>"I'd like 2 beef, one seafood and one vegetarian."</p><p>"2 beef, 1 seafood, 1 vegetarian. Anything else?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"Delivery or pickup?"</p><p>"Delivery." Saburo gave them the address and phone number.</p><p>"Ok, forty five minutes."</p><p>"Thanks." Saburo hung up the phone and mentally added 30 minutes to the time—something his father called the Chinese Takeout time warp. No matter how large or complicated the order, the answer was always the same.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>As Ranma and Shampoo caught up on each other's lives for the past ten years, Cobb and Marx were at the bar. "Scoot, how does your wife know the Ambassador?"<p>"Let me ask you this, Doc, before I answer: Do you know where Shampoo's from?"</p><p>"Some backwater province, who's name escapes me for the moment." Cobb replied, taking a sip of his Johnny Walker.</p><p>"The same backwater province that became autonomous five years ago. After Shampoo showed a keen mind in diplomacy, and got the three major powers there to agree to give peace a chance.</p><p>"There's a training ground in the province that Ranma was brought to by her father. I can't and won't go into all the details, but you probably remember what I said before Major Thompson kicked our asses into our cockpits. That was where she escaped from her father's clutches." Marx took a sip of his sake. "Ranma was adopted into Shampoo's family."</p><p>"So your wife's a Chinese national?"</p><p>"No. She's still Japanese; always has always will be. The way Ranma described it, it barely made sense then, and still doesn't today."</p><p>"Ah, I see," Cobb said, even though he didn't really.</p><p>"Don't feel uncomfortable about it, Doc. Like I said, I still don't understand Ranma's relationship with the Ambassador. And I've been married to her all these years." Marx drained the last of his sake. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to interrupt the two." Cobb nodded, and ordered another Johnny Walker Blue, as his former wingman asked his wife to dance.</p><p>The dance floor was virtually empty as the band began playing a slow Benny Goodman number. Cobb looked at his friend and wondered what his life would have been like if he'd ever gotten married. He reflected back on his bachelor's life and thought of lost opportunities—like that green-haired school teacher he dated while at Misawa.</p><p>Setsuna had told him she wasn't ready for a steady relationship, as her work as an educator was paramount, and she was vying for a slot in the guidance department of the then-brand new Juuban High School. Cobb finished his glass of scotch and resolved to stop wallowing in self-pity, maybe even see if she was still working at Juuban.</p><p>"You're still as graceful as ever, my dear," Marx remarked to his wife, as the band finished <i>If Dreams Come True</i> and shifted into Glenn Miller's <i>Moonlight Serenade</i>.</p><p>"And you're still horrible with compliments, anata," Ranma teased.</p><p>"That's it; you're going to get it tonight."</p><p>"You can try, Christopher," she countered.</p><p>"No nookie for you, then," Marx replied with mock seriousness.</p><p>"Please," she begged, pouting cutely and coupled it with sad puppy dog eyes.</p><p>"Maybe. If you tell me what you and your sister were talking about."</p><p>"Amazon business. No business for stupid foreigner males," she replied, in Shampoo's sometimes bimbo-ish Japanese.</p><p>"Let's see…as head of the household, if it concerns my family, it's my business; and since I'm an Amazon by marriage, it becomes my business. And as defense attaché, if it affects the security of the United States or any of it's allies, if becomes my business. Shall I go on?"</p><p>"There is a problem, but its closer to home. A heck of a lot closer." <i>Moonlight Serenade</i> had just ended, and the band moved to a faster number, one Marx wasn't inclined to dance to. He led his wife over to a quite corner of the reception hall. "How much closer," he asked as he sat down.</p><p>Ranma sat across from him, adjusting her evening gown. "Let's say, for example, that a certain Elder 'forgot' that Saburo is the son of an Amazon, and not an outsider."</p><p>"And…let me guess, based on what you and Shampoo have told me. Summer is usually the time for the annual Challenge, correct?" Ranma nodded. "And somehow, Saburo got involved."</p><p>Ranma sighed. "He defeated this year's champion, Tigar. She Kissed him."</p><p>Marx pushed his glasses up, and rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Did they…?"</p><p>"No. Shampoo suspended the Kiss, since the kids were due to leave the next day."</p><p>"Thank God for small favors and a sister in law whose an Elder. What else did Shampoo have to say about our son, Casanova? Or our daughter in law?"</p><p>"Tigar came with Shampoo to the Chinese Embassy, and had been adopted by Elder Rinse after she arrived in the village.</p><p>"You're also not going to believe the rest of what I'm about to say."</p><p>Marx smiled at his wife. "I believed you 16 years ago, when you told me magic existed."</p><p>"Well, I hope you're still ready to believe. Tigar is a tiger that happened to fall in the Nyanniichuan."</p><p>"Ok, that I can believe. But there's more, isn't there?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Our daughter in law is…unique, which is how Shampoo described it to me."</p><p>"Well then, I guess I'll inform Her Excellency that we'd like to meet our daughter in law."</p><p>"Shouldn't be too hard. Shampoo said she's going to be in Saburo's class at Juuban High."</p><p>"Great," was all that Marx muttered, after downing a glass of champagne.</p>
