</div><p>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer</p><p>The phone rang, pulling them back  from the abyss.  Ranma answered it,  automatically using Japanese.  "Moshi,  moshi; Marx-ke."</p><p>There was a pregnant pause on the  other side, followed some background noise, then a familiar voice answering.  "<i>Hi Ranma.  Sorry to bother you or your husband, but my father needs to speak  with your husband.</i>"</p><p>"Oh, okay Angelica…" Ranma looked  at her husband.  "Chris?  Christopher-kun?"</p><p>That pulled him back to  reality.  "What is it?"</p><p>"The father of one of my classmates  needs to speak with you."</p><p>The change in Marx from cold,  calculating fighter pilot to caring husband was dynamic.  Ranma had heard the steel in his voice  before; when they were discussing her father…her, hopefully, late father.  Marx took the receiver from his wife.  "Lt. Marx."</p><p>"<i>Lieutenant, it's Staff Sergeant  O'Brien.  Angelica told me about an  incident that happened today at lunch</i>."</p><p>Marx relaxed a little further,  recognizing the voice of his crew chief.   "Did this incident that Angelica tell you about have anything to do with  Ranma in the cafeteria at the high school?"</p><p>"<i>How did…oh, of course, Ranma  probably told you.  From what my  daughter told me, and I'm sure what Ranma said, Virgil was the one that started  it.  He's been after my daughter since  we arrived here, and Angie's been spurning him everyday, so I'm sure that he  mistook their friendship as something else.   Especially when Ranma told Virgil to…get out of her face in a not so  delicate manner.</i>"  SSgt. O'Brien's  comments had the Lieutenant smiling.</p><p>"Alright, Sarge.  I'll explain to the old man what happened in  the morning.  Then it goes to the  General after that.  And if nothing happens  from him, then we can both talk to Social Actions and the principal…" Marx  trailed off, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>"<i>Understood, sir.  Hopefully the old man will have some  insight.  See you in the morning, LT.</i>"</p><p>Marx hung up the phone, and looked  at his young wife.  He should have had  some inkling that this was going to happen.   Ranma was a young, attractive woman; there was nothing that could  diminish that.  She was going to attract  this sort of attention regardless where she goes to school.  He chuckled sardonically.  He remembered when he was that age, how some  of the girls would play hard to get or were seeing some homicidal maniac; how  he'd get tongue-tied and flustered with some of the girls in his class.  He was always the shy one, except when it  came to Ranma.</p><p>His mind was on autopilot as he sat  down and ate in an almost mechanical manner, barely tasting the food.  Ranma noticed it, and kept her conversation  to a minimum.  The dishes washed and put  away, Ranma went off to do her homework; Marx headed back to the office to  continue doing some of his paperwork.   By virtue of a Top Secret clearance from his Army days, he was also the  squadron's classified materials custodian when he wasn't flying.  So he was going through all the documents  his predecessor was supposed to have maintained, but didn't.  His supposedly better filing system was to  just throw in the new documents and changes in with the old and bitch about the  system.  This left Marx with the task of  sitting down with the regulations and going through and reorganizing the files.  It wasn't a bad tasking just boring.  He was also lucky that the Air Force  Regulations were unclassified, so he could sit and highlight exactly what  needed to be corrected for the morning.</p><p>Just outside the base perimeter, opposite, in fact,  of where their house was, a large panda sat watching the Marxs as they went  about their business for the night.  It  had taken this particular panda many months to finally find where his elusive  quarry was, arriving sometimes within hours after they left town.  During this quest, there were times like  this that the individual in question was glad he had fallen into the spring of  drowned panda. It, at least, wasn't permanent like the one that his ungrateful  whelp of a son fell into.  Not that this  particular master of Anything Goes would take any blame for turning his son  into his daughter.  No, this particular  master was on a mission to find his so…daughter, kidnap…er, convince her to  come, and marry her off to a Tendo, so that he could retire and live off his  son's…daughter's hard work.  Besides,  the fur coat helped keep him warm, especially as the first flakes of an  impending storm landed on his black nose.</p><p>So he sat, watching, and waiting  for the perfect moment to get his daughter from that <i>amerikajin</i> she was  living with.  Now, if he could just find  something to eat.</p><p>Lying in bed, reading a copy of  Time, Marx watched his wife get ready for bed. Ranma never ceased to amaze her  husband how graceful and beautiful the former boy was.  Even the faint scars from the Neko-ken  training that were still visible didn't detract from her looks.  Sure, the nightgown she put on wasn't  exactly romantic, but it didn't detract from her looks either.  She noticed her husband looking over the top  of the magazine.  "What are you looking  at, <i>anata</i>?"</p><p>Marx set his magazine down.  "What, I can't look at my wife?"  He asked with a smile.</p><p>Ranma returned his smile.  "Of course, but with such a lecherous look,  you old hentai?"</p><p>"Hentai?  Frankly my dear, I'm not a pervert."</p><p>"Oh really," Marx's young wife  countered, as she climbed into bed.   "Then why did you marry a teenager?"</p><p>"Because I fell in love with  her the moment I saw her," he said with complete sincerity.</p><p>"So, who is she?  Who's this teenager that you're so in love  with that you had to marry?"</p><p>"You already know her.  I believe her name is Ranma."</p><p>She snuggled onto her  husband's chest.  "And here I thought it  was someone else."  There was a hint of  mischief in her voice as she said it.</p><p>Marx leaned down and kissed  the top of his wife's head.  "Get some  sleep.  We've both got a long day ahead  of us tomorrow."  Ranma's only answer  was a muffled snore.  "Good night, my  love," he whispered as he turned out the lights, which would have been noticed  if a certain panda was awake and watching the house.</p><p>Morning broke over northern  Japan with two feet of fresh snow and more to come during the day, and Ranma  out on the patio practicing her katas.   The snow gave the base commander the authority to declare a safety day  for base, closing down all nonessential offices and the schools, including the  high school and non-alert members of the 13th and 14th  fighter squadrons.  Marx was supposed to  go on alert that evening, in addition to finishing the reorganizing the  classified files.  That was until the  Operations officer, Major Wegner, called to tell him to just report to the  building at 3 for alert duty only, but be available as spare crew in case of a  scramble.</p><p>Steaming cup of coffee in  hand, Marx stepped outside on to the patio.   He watched Ranma make her martial arts seem effortless, but ten years on  the road will to that.  The steadily  falling snow made his wife look like an angel as she did her exercises, her  movements fluid and conservative with energy as she fought an unseen opponent, unconcerned  about the weather.  He didn't want to  interrupt, but he did clear his throat.   Ranma faltered, but recovered quickly.   "How long were you standing there?"</p><p>"Long enough to watch  you.  You're quite amazing."  Ranma blushed.  "I wanted to also let you know that school's been cancelled, and  I don't have to go in until four."</p><p>"So what would you like to  do, then?"</p><p>Marx sheepishly looked at his  wife, as he set his coffee cup down on the snow-covered table.  "Would you mind teaching me Anything Goes?"</p><p>"You're really interested in  learning?  You do understand that I'm  not going to go easy on you."  Marx  nodded.  "How much martial arts have you  had?"</p><p>"Some aikido, some tae kwon  doe; not much."</p><p>"Ok.  Then why don't we begin today?"<br/>-</p><p>Marx sat in the tub, soaking  out the fatigue and muscle burn with the hot water.  The exercises that his wife put him through would have been one  thing when he was 18, but fourteen years of lifting loaded or, in some cases,  overloaded stretchers into ambulances, moving equipment with "US Army" or "US  Air Force" stenciled on the sides, moving household belongings, survival  school, and excessive G-forces had taken their toll on his flexibility, not  that he was all that flexible to begin with.   His head was resting against the edge of the tub and the wall; eyes  closed but not yet asleep.  But he heard  the door to the bathroom open, and the light footfalls of his wife on the tile  floor.</p><p>Ranma knelt down next to the  tub, intent on surprising her husband.   She knew that she overworked him this morning, and wanted to make it up  to him in a special way.  She knelt down  next to the tub and kissed her husband on his forehead.  He barely stirred.  With a wicked grin on her face, she climbed into the tub, and  straddled his hips.</p><p>Marx shot open his eyes.  "What the…" he trailed off when he saw his  wife smiling cutely at him.  "Playing  kiss and making up for putting me through the wringer, <i>aisuru</i>?"</p><p>"Or something like that, <i>anata</i>."  An afternoon of lovemaking followed, but  there was something nagging at the back of Ranma's mind, but it was ignored by  her libido.</p>
