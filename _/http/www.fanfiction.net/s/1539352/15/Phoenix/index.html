</div><p>The phone next to the bed began  ringing, pulling Ranma out of a sound sleep.  "Marx residence," she said. She  cracked an eye open, and saw the friendly red letters on the clock proclaim 2:15 in the morning.</p><p>"Mrs. Marx, this is Staff Sergeant Summerall,  the night operations NCO. Sorry to  bother you this early, but the Captain needs to report in as soon as possible."</p><p>"I'll wake him, but is there any  reason why?"</p><p>"Sorry ma'am, I can't say over a  nonsecure phone."</p><p>"Thank you, Sergeant. Good night."  Ranma hung the phone back up, and began poking her husband. "Chris, wake up." No response, so she began poking harder.  "Chris, wake up." Still no response from  him, so it was time for drastic measures.  She flipped him out of bed.</p><p>"Why'd you do that for,  tomboy?" Marx asked sleepily.</p><p>"Because I couldn't wake you up any  other way, baka." She held out her hand  to him. Marx reached up, grabbed it, and  pulled his wife to him. "Not now," she  said between passionate kisses. "You  have to report in immediately."</p><p>"Did they say why?"</p><p>"No, just as soon as possible," she  replied, as her husband's hands roamed up under her pajama top. "He did sound serious about it. Hey, cut it out!" Defending her honor against her husband, she  used a new move that she'd learned from TV, of all places. Ranma placed her hand at the junction of the  neck and shoulder of her husband, and squeezed.  "Beware the dreaded Anything Goes Vulcan nerve pinch."</p><p>"Alright, alright already," Marx  growled, with his wife's hand pinching off his vagus nerve. He reached up and removed Ranma's hand from  his neck. As he pulled on his flightsuit  and boots, he looked at his wife. "I'll  get you later, aisuru."</p><p>Ranma fluttered her eyes at him,  coyly. "You can try, anata. You can try."</p><p>Marx kissed his wife, and headed  out the door. He jumped into his jeep,  and pulled out of his driveway; Ranma waving to him from the upstairs  window. Racing through the streets of Summit,  he surmised there was a reason for the early morning phone call with limited  information. The squadron was going on  alert status. He pushed the sixty year  old four cylinder engine for all it was worth, to get to the base.</p><p>Running into the briefing room,  Marx grabbed a seat in the back. Pilots  were sitting there, in various states of alertness. Some had just been woken up, others were  bright-eyed and bushy tailed, yet others were sucking off of oxygen tanks that  Life Support had "conveniently" placed in the briefing room.</p><p>The room was called to attention as  Colonel Reed walked in. He walked  quickly to the podium, as the room lights dimmed. "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I won't offer apologies on why you're  here. I will remind you that this  briefing is classified. No information  is to be released to the public or your families at this time. In the spirit of cooperation, the Soviet  Union contacted the State Department with information pertaining to a piece of  lost equipment.</p><p>"It seems our colleagues in the  Soviet Air Force seem to have 'lost' a Backfire." With that statement, the room shook from a  massive face fault, as all twenty pilots hit the tiled floor. Colonel Reed gave his pilots a few moments to  recover. "The Soviets did not say  whether the bomber stolen was configured as a bomber or long range interceptor. Nor did they say it where it was stolen from.</p><p>"Reports from Langley indicate that  the bomber was stolen from one of the southern republics, and may have been  'acquired' by Al Qaida, for a new phase of terror attacks. That information, however, has not been  verified.</p><p>"What this means for us is this: 1st,  2nd, and 3rd Air Defense Commands are now on alert. We will continue to run our standard strip  alerts, but with patrols out 1200 miles.  Tanker support will be at 600 miles out, with standard callsign of  'Texaco'. There will be Navy carriers  will be operating at the 1800 to 2400 mile range, because of this situation.</p><p>"Patrol schedule will have First  and Third elements on alert status, Second and Fourth are on patrol status  every other month, until we get the stand down order. Somehow, ladies and gentlemen, I don't see  that order being rescinded anytime soon.</p><p>"Element leaders, you are dismissed  schedule your elements." Reed looked at  his acting executive officer. "Marx, my  office." Marx nodded and followed the  squadron commander out of the briefing room.</p><p>"Yes sir," he asked, as he closed  the door to Reed's office.</p><p>"How do you think you did on your  board yesterday?"</p><p>Marx looked down at his feet, and  scuffed his boot across the floor.  "Somehow, sir, I doubt I'm getting promoted."</p><p>"What makes you say that?"</p><p>"I was asked a few questions about  my wife."</p><p>"Such as?"</p><p>"Her past—the fact that she's spent  time in the People's Republic of China as a martial artist. And her age when I married her."</p><p>"How old was Ranma when you married  her?"</p><p>Marx sighed. "She was sixteen sir," he said flatly. Second time in less than twenty four hours he  was asked how old his wife was when they met.</p><p>"I see," Reed said. "I'm sure there where extenuating  circumstances."</p><p>"Yes sir. She'd been thrown out of her family for  refusing to an arranged marriage with someone she'd never met. Plus, her father was a drunken bastard who'd  think nothing of prostituting his daughter for his own gain."</p><p>"And you explained that to the  board?"</p><p>"I did, sir."</p><p>Reed looked at the thirty seven  year old promotable captain sitting in front of his desk. "Marx," he said, "don't worry about it. General Rodriguez is a fair man. He'll see both sides of the issue."</p><p>"Understood sir. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to rack out  for a few in my office." Marx stood,  saluted his superior, and left the Colonel's office. As he walked to his sanctuary, Marx hoped  that Reed was correct in his assessment of the Wing Commander.</p><p>The alarm went off as it did every  morning at 6 am. Ranma peeled an eye open, and looked at the  evil device. She was seriously  contemplating destroying it, since she didn't need to be up that early. Her son was with her mother-in-law; her  husband was already at the squadron, so she didn't need to get up as early as  it was. Rationalizing, if she got up  later, she'd never get out of bed early on a regular basis. Changing into a warm up suit, she went into  the backyard to begin her morning exercises.</p><p>The pond her husband had added was  a nice touch, creating a calming influence to the yard, making it almost like  what was up in Cresskill. Which was a  nice effect, since the back of their property line abutted State Highway 24,  making it an oasis in the noise of traffic on the other side of the sound  barrier. The yard had an almost Zen  influence, the way the wind chimes complimented the bubbling of the falls in  the pond. Of course there were also the  train tracks around the pond. Ranma had  laughed at her husband when he put them in.  But his response was he had trains when he was three, so why not let  Saburo have them as well. But it was her  husband who played with the trains more than their son did.</p><p>She'd just finished her first warm  up kata when the first wave of nausea hit her.  Ranma was barely in the kitchen when the second wave hit her, along with  the remnants of dinner. <i>Maybe I shouldn't have made sukiyaki last  night</i>, she said to herself. But that  more rational part of her mind, the one that many years ago told she wasn't  raped by her rescuer, said that she'd cooked sukiyaki before. "I've also been late," she muttered to  herself.</p><p>The final pieces clicked in her  head. "Oh boy," she muttered, "I'm pregnant. I guess Chris will be thrilled." She rinsed her mouth out, and made a phone  call to the base hospital.</p><p>Marx was sleeping, fitfully, on a  folding cot in his office. The cot was  there only for those nights that weather or mission requirements kept him on  the base. And owning an old jeep that  made the weather requirements rare.  There was a knock at his office door.  Rolling upright, he opened it and squinted. "Yes Sergeant?"</p><p>"Captain Marx, your wife is here to  see you."</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and grabbed his  glasses off the desk. "Show her  in." He sat on the edge of the folding  cot, still trying to get his bearings.  "So, what can I do for you, Ranma?"</p><p>"Oh, nothing really," she replied,  coyly. She teasingly ran her hand along  her husband's nomex-clad chest. Marx  noticed that she was wearing was wearing the same lavender floral print kimono  she'd been wearing before they met with Nodoka.</p><p>"'Oh, nothing really?'" He quoted back to her. "Then why are you wearing that particular  kimono?"</p><p>"Well…I just wanted to tell you how  much I love you. And…" she gave him such  a kawaii look.</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"You're going to be a father."</p><p>"I'm already a…" Marx's voice  trailed off, as he realized what his wife just said. He stood and swept Ranma up into a hug, twirling  her around. "How far along?"</p><p>"Two months, anata."</p><p>"Mom'll be happy."</p><p>"Hai. Both our mothers."</p><p>"I hope I'm not interrupting  anything," Col. Reed said in the doorway, after clearing his throat. "Mrs. Marx."</p><p>"Ah, no sir," Marx replied, putting  his wife down. Ranma looked embarrassed,  blushing furiously. "What's up sir?"</p><p>"I've heard some news from General  Rodriguez. His decision has not been set  in stone yet, but you needn't worry about your wife's past coming back to haunt  you right now."</p><p>Marx's smile got even bigger, if it  was possible. "Thank you, sir. That's extremely good news." It didn't hurt that Marx was also the only  one in the Wing, and the F-106G community, with a red star painted on his  intake for a lucky shot fired in the blind.  The Air Force has allowed him to keep the kill marking, even though it  raised holy hell with the State Department.  For the General Dynamics division of Lockheed-Martin, it was vindication  that their design could tangle with the best the Soviet Union had, especially  after reviewing the gun camera footage, and quieting the naysayers in their  parent corporation about such an obsolete design.</p><p>Ranma kissed her husband on the  cheek. "I've got to get to class, and  then Saburo. I'll see you later. I hope."</p><p>Marx hugged his young wife. "I hope so too."</p><p>-<br/>52°10"N 26°0"W</p><p>Out over the Atlantic, Al-Qaida was  about to enter a new phase of terror on the Western nations. Having launched from an abandoned WWII  airbase in the interior of Morocco, their latest terror weapon was orbiting at  an intercept point, well outside of radar range of most ATC radars. Add that they were following total emissions  control; the bomber did not exist on radar with their transponder turned  off. The terrorist crew had the bomber's  twin Kuznetsov engines set at a reduced power, increasing their loiter time as  they sipped from four external drop tanks.</p><p>Their target was moving into the  ambush fat, dumb and happy. The crew of  the Backfire turned their radar on, and flipped one of their longer range  missiles at the Boeing 787. Within  moments of missile launch, the passenger jet turned into self feeding,  expanding fireball. Without a peep, the  raider left the engagement area and headed back to their base, as the fireball  extinguished itself.</p><p>-<br/>Morristown AFS</p><p>The television in the break room  was tuned to Fox News, allowing the crews to listen to the latest breaking  news. No mention, however, was made of  the missing Backfire, indicating how much wasn't coming from the Soviet Union. "<i>Breaking  news from our Spanish office. At </i><i>2 am</i><i>, Eastern Time, El Al flight LY028  disappeared without a trace off the Iberian Peninsula. At this time, there are no clues or leads as  to what happened.</i></p><p><i>"There  is, however, the speculation of a possible terror attack, no organization has  claimed responsibility, and investigators are not ruling out a possibility of  an aircraft design fault.</i>"</p><p>"Who wants to lay money on it being  our missing Backfire," was the question being asked by several of the pilots in  the squadron.</p><p>Marx stood at the back of the break  room, watching the news, and listening to the conversations of the crews. There was anger, there was outrage, and there  was understanding. A lot of the younger  pilots didn't remember September 11th the way the older pilots did,  the way the units were unable to intercept the airliners in time. Marx remembered it very well because he was  with his Guard unit at Teterboro the day after, awaiting a FEMA flight from Denver;  he was in lower Manhattan the following week, helping with recovery operations,  he saw the pile of rubble that was the World Trade Center. Like December   7, 1941, 9/11 was a pivotal moment in history.</p><p>And now it seemed that the War on  Terror was moving to a new phase. No  longer did it seem that Al-Qaida was content on trying to blow up airliners  with suicide bombers. Security controls  at the airports prevented that, air marshals prevented that, passenger  awareness prevented that. The only thing  that didn't prevent it was total air dominance.  It took so long to get fighters into the air, and into response  locations. And it was unfortunate that  certain NATO allies were keeping their fighters on the ground, saying it wasn't  their fight.</p><p>Ranma stood outside the Customs  checkpoint in Terminal 4 at JFK International Airport in New York, waiting for  her guests. She'd heard on the news  about the attack on the flight in from Hong Kong, and hoped her sister was all  right. The doors opened, and out came  the passengers from the flight, and it wasn't hard to pick out her sister. "Xian Pu!"  Ranma called in rusty Joketsuzoku Mandarin, waving to the  lavender-tressed Amazon. The last time  she spoke Mandarin was when she called Balm about her father-in-law.</p><p>Shampoo smiled and ran over to her  sister. "Ranma," she called in equally  rusty Japanese. The two sisters hugged  each other fiercely, since they hadn't seen each other in almost seven years,  and the Amazon had just survived a near-death experience. Standing off to the side, like a proper  Amazon male, was her husband with their daughter. "Ranma, I'd like you to meet my husband Ming,  and our daughter Xian Li."</p><p>"Pleased to meet you," Ranma said,  with a bow. She looked at her  niece. "I'm Aunty Ranma."</p><p>"The honor is mine, sister-in-law."</p><p>The seven year old hid cautiously  behind her father's robes. "She's still  too too shy," Shampoo said, sighing. "So  unlike her mother but so much like her aunt."</p><p>Ranma looked at her sister. "I had a reason to be shy, sister. You know that."</p><p>"I know, but its fun teasing you  about it. Where's your husband?"</p><p>"Christopher-kun is at work. He's been there for the past month."</p><p>"Oh. I hope he was in one of the fighters that  chased those terrorists away from our plane."</p><p>"So do I. But he's second in command for his unit, so  he doesn't always get the time in that he used to," Ranma replied with a sigh. "But at least he's not moody because of it. As much as he loves flying, he's also enjoying  the responsibilities of command. Odd as  it may sound for him."</p><p>Shampoo looked at her Japanese  sister. "No, your husband is becoming a  war leader. Especially since it's an  uncertain world we live in."</p><p>Ranma nodded, as they retrieved  their luggage. "So what ever happened to  Mu Tzu? Your last letters were kind of  vague on it."</p><p>"Stupid blind boy fall in Nyanniichuan,  but she got captured by Musk during raid. Just desserts I say. But infiltration party had to wash girl-type  Mousse with Xi Fa Xiang Gao, so that Musk wouldn't get his Hidden Weapons technique."</p><p>Ranma chuckled, remembering the  number of times that the blind Amazon glomped her  thinking she was Shampoo. That boy was a  nuisance to the tribe, despite his mastery at an obscure Amazon martial art.</p><p>When they picked up Saburo from his  grandmother's, Shampoo gushed at just how cute her nephew was, as did Ranma's  mother-in-law did with Shampoo's daughter.</p>
