</div><p>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer.</p><p>With the Jeep idling outside the  squadron building, Marx kissed his wife good-bye.  "We should be relieved about this time tomorrow.  I'll call you when I'm back at the building."</p><p>"I'll see you tomorrow, then, <i>anata</i>."  Her husband grabbed his bags from the back  of the Jeep and watched her pull away.   He cringed as she ground the transmission shifting between first and  second.</p><p>"Ready for tonight, Scooter?"  Doctor asked.</p><p>Marx scrubbed his hand through his  short, receding hair.  "I guess so.  Is the Old Man in?"</p><p>"Yeah, you just got here," joked  Cobb.  Marx fixed his wingman with such  a glare that promised a thrashing at tonight's poker game.  "Surprisingly, the Colonel's in his office,  Scoot."</p><p>"Good.  Give me five, maybe ten minutes, and I'll meet you in the  briefing room."  Cobb nodded, as the two  pilots headed inside.  Marx paused at  the CO's office, gathered up his courage, and knocked.</p><p>"Enter."  Marx did as he was requested, and walked into Col. Bell's  office.  "Lieutenant Marx, what can I do  for you?"</p><p>"Sir, I'd like to explain to you  what happened yesterday between my wife and the CG's son."</p><p>Bell sat back.  "Lieutenant, I know you'd like to do  something about this, but the General has made up his mind.  You know that we're not exactly Number One  on the General's list of favorite units."</p><p>"Maybe if the General would  consider having the other fighter squadron actually do their jobs, we wouldn't  have to continue to wax their tails when we go up and play."  Marx commented, pushing the envelope with  the Colonel.</p><p>Bell looked at this impertinent  lieutenant.  "Lieutenant, be careful  what you say, and where you day it.   I'll let your comment slide, this time.</p><p>"Now, don't you have an alert to  pull?"</p><p>"Yes sir."  Marx saluted and left the office.<p>-</p><p>Even with the snow, certain base  facilities were still open—namely the commissary and the exchange.  Ranma had to do some shopping for the house,  picking up some food, supplies…doing the domestic things that a family does,  even when her husband is at work.  And  she was quite lucky that both were virtually empty.  She hated crowds; it was something that she realized when she  reached Beijing, and was trying to find the Japanese Embassy.  But at the same time, she had enjoyed the  anonymity of being in a crowd.</p><p>She was walking down one of the  aisles of the commissary, intent on getting particular hygiene products, when  she realized she was being followed.   Looking out the large plate glass windows in the front of the grocery  store, Ranma could see that it was still snowing at a fair clip.  She also caught sight of Virgil's reflection  in the glass.  She nonchalantly ducked  down to the main aisle and over to the produce section.  Which turned out to be a mistake.</p><p>She found herself cornered by Virgil's  goon squad from the soccer team.   "Kuso," she muttered.  "What  Virgil?"</p><p>"I see you're alone now.  So, Ranma, why don't you and I get to know  each other better…more intimately."  The  look on Virgil's face could outshine even the biggest pervert in the  world.  "And I don't mind if you call me  'Virgil'," he crooned.</p><p>"Yesterday didn't teach you  lesson," she asked in her slightly broken English.  "I not interested."</p><p>"You're little dyke lover isn't  here, so why don't you give me some loving?"   Virgil, at this point, had sidled up next to Ranma, and started pawing  the redheaded martial artist, particularly in several…inappropriate locations.</p><p>Despite wanting to play "Pound the  Pervert", Ranma kept her restraint and began screaming like there was no  tomorrow.  "Shut up!" Virgil shouted, as  his goon squad suddenly broke, and ran.</p><p>Ranma didn't respond, instead  choosing to continue to scream.  She was  loud and piercing enough to attract the attention of a combined USAF/JASDF  security patrol parked just outside the commissary.  They came running in, as the American cop was calling in for back  up.  The manager was already there,  trying to find out what was happening.</p><p>The two cops separated everyone,  and began interviewing.  "Marx-san," the  JASDF corporal said, "what happened?"   Ranma had begun calming down, and explained what happened in quiet  Japanese.  Two more Security Forces  cruisers and the flight chief's pickup pulled up.  The additional cops kept everyone apart, while the initial two  cops briefed the flight chief.</p><p>"This is the fourth complaint that  we've received about the BC's son doing this," the master sergeant  growled.  "This time we teach him a  lesson."</p><p>"But Sarge, his father's the  commanding general," the initial responding airman stated.</p><p>"Doesn't matter, Airman.  Have you ever met Lieutenant Marx,  yet?"  The airman shook his head.  "The Lieutenant was one of us.  And he takes the time to get know us, work  with us, and gets coffee out to us when he's not on alert.</p><p>"The young lady over there," the  flight chief pointed over at Ranma, "is his wife.  And young Mr. Leonard crossed the line this time."  Reaching around, the sergeant retrieved his  handcuffs from his pistol belt.  "Virgil  Leonard, we're placing you under apprehension for inappropriate sexual contact  and sexual harassment."  The base  commander's son blanched as he heard the sergeant.  "We can do this two ways—the easy way, or the hard way."  Privately, the flight chief was hoping for  the hard way.</p><p>Quietly, Virgil turned and placed  his hands behind his back.  The flight  chief had the initial responding airman handcuff and do a quick pat down of the  boy, before escorting him to the waiting cruiser.</p><p>"Mrs. Marx," the flight chief said,  "we need you to come down to the squadron to sign the complaint against him."</p><p>"H-hai," she replied, still a  little more than shaken by the whole ordeal, flinching when the flight chief  went to put his arm around her, as a supportive gesture, and to guide her to  another cruiser.  <i>Kami-sama</i>, she  thought, <i>have I become that afraid of a man's touch?</i>  Then she remembered the differences between  her husband, and the crass young man sitting in the back of the other cruiser;  the way Marx's hands, calloused as they were, were gentle when he caressed her,  touched her.  Not like Virgil's overly  enthusiastic, sloppy manhandling.  When  she looked at Virgil, there was a look of scorn and disgust on her face.  All she wanted to do when she finished  swearing out the complaint against him was to take a long hot shower.<br/>-</p><p>The poker game in the alert billets  was in full swing, with quite a pot sitting in the center of the table.  With the weather forecast for more snow,  there was probably little chance of them launching.  Cobb, Marx, the mechanics and crew chiefs, and the cops from  inside the fence were in a heated game, as cigar and cigarette smoke turned the  air in the dayroom gray.  The only thing  missing from the table was the beer; but since they were on five minute alert,  soda was the substitute.</p><p>Two phones started ringing at the  same time.  Marx's crew chief, SSgt  O'Brien answered one, while Cobb answered the other one.  "Lieutenant," O'Brien called over, "your  wife is sitting at Security Control.   Apparently the BC's son tried to…take advantage of her."  The cigar in Marx's hand split and crushed  as his hand convulsed.  "Don't worry  sir.  The cops are taking care of it."</p><p>"Good.  I'm still going to head over there…"</p><p>"Uh, Scooter," Cobb said from the  other, more important phone.  "We have a  scramble.  Unidentified contacts from  the west."  With that statement, the  poker game was forgotten, and everyone dashed out of the dayroom.</p><p>As one of the mechanics started the  motors that opened the pod doors, the crew chiefs did a quick inspection of  their fighters, and plugged their headsets into an external interphone  jack.  Marx and Cobb were already in  their respective fighters, auxiliary power units running.  With thumbs up, the engines on both fighters  lit off, and a quick control surface check later, the crew chiefs disconnected  and saluted their pilots.</p><p>The fighters taxied out of their  respective pods.  "Misawa Tower, Alfa  ready to launch."</p><p>"<i>Alfa, Misawa Tower. You are  cleared to launch.  Contact Skywatch on  button 4.</i>"</p><p>The two-ship formation of F-106s  rocketed down the runway, before streaking skyward in a steep 80-degree  climb.  Marx changed radio channels and  keyed the radio, as both fighters climbed past 35 thousand feet.  "Skywatch, this is Alfa."</p><p>"<i>Roger Alfa.  Turn to heading 280.  Contacts at bearing 270, speed 250, flight  level 550.</i>"  The controller onboard  the E-3C AWACS reported.</p><p>The American fighters banked on to  their new heading, as their pilots pulled back to minimum afterburner, to close  quickly, but still conserve fuel.  "<i>Tally-ho!</i>"  Cobb called over the radio.  "<i>I have a tally on the bandits.  Look like two Mike-India-Gulf Two Niners and  two Tango Uniform Niner Fives.  Looks  like they're on a heading for Misawa.</i>"   The way the full moon was reflecting on the cloudbanks below provided  sufficient illumination for both pilots to make out the Soviet aircraft as they  closed on them.</p><p>As they neared the Soviet  formation, the American fighters matched speeds and joined the formation.  "Doctor, monitor button 4," Marx said over  the radio.  "I'll try to contact them."  He switched his secondary radio over to the  international distress frequency—121.5—and keyed his mike.  "Soviet aircraft, Soviet aircraft.  This is Air Force Alfa 31.  You are approaching restricted airspace.  I say again, you are approaching restricted  airspace and will need to divert."</p><p>Marx heard the controllers on the  AWACS passing information back and forth. He switched his radio back.  "Cobb, start falling back.  Standby to go to weapons arm.  Do not, I say again, do not lock your  weapons on the targets."</p><p>"<i>Roger, Scooter.</i>"  The pair of Delta Darts fell back with one  notch of speed brakes and flaps to slow them down.  The two MiG-29 Fulcrums broke off their escort of the two huge  turboprop bombers and moved to blocking positions.</p><p>"Skywatch, Alfa.  Requesting weapons hot, negative reply from  Soviet aircraft.  Is Bravo airborne yet?"</p><p>"<i>Alfa, Skywatch.  I copy negative reply from Soviet  aircraft.  Negative weapons hot at this  time.  I say again, negative weapons  hot.  Bravo is airborne and enroute to  your position.</i>"</p><p>"Roger Skywatch.  Doctor, try contacting the Soviets.  It's possible my alternate radio isn't  working."</p><p>"<i>Roger, Scooter.</i>"  Cobb tried contacting the Soviet  aircraft.  "<i>Negative reply, Scooter.</i>"</p><p>"Understood."  Marx replied.  In the inky night, he could make out the positional strobes of  the backup alert crew.  "Skywatch,  Alfa.  I have visual on Bravo."</p><p>"<i>Roger, Alfa.  Standby.</i>"</p><p>"Roger, Skywatch, standing by."</p><p>Will the Cold War heat up?   Will Virgil get the punishment his so justly deserves?  And just what about Genma?</p><p>Authors Notes:</p><p>Some explanations for this particular story.  It takes place today, but it's a definite alternate  universe.  The Soviet Union never  dissolved in the early 90s; the Cold War isn't over.  So that means five-minute alerts for PACAF and the rest of the  Air Force.</p><p>A note about the F-106 variant used in the story.  It doesn't exist, except as a kit-bash  sitting on my workbench, a logical evolution of the Delta Dart to incorporate  modern 21st Century avionics, engines, and armaments.  Eventually some images will appear on my  website of it.</p>
