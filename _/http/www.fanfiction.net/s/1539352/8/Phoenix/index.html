</div><p>See Chapter 1 for  Disclaimer</p><p>With the onset of March, and spring's fast approach,  Ranma decided to surprise her husband one morning at breakfast.  She'd spent most of last month fighting  morning sickness, so in a way it was time to come clean.  It was a maintenance down day, which meant  that both squadrons were grounded so that their respective maintenance  squadrons could catch up on much needed work on the fighters.  It also meant that recently promoted Captain  Marx was planning on enjoying a leisurely day at home, catching up on his  reading.  "Chris," she said, looking  over the breakfast table at him, "there's something you should know."</p><p>"Hmm," he replied.  "Is Virgil still bothering you?  I thought the base commander shipped him  back to the States."</p><p>"No, no.  Nothing like that at all.   In fact school's been kind of boring since Virgil left.  What I have to say is a little closer to the  two of us."  Marx's eyebrow shot up with  that.  The grandfather clock in the  living room, a gift from Marx's parents, rang out eight  o'clock.  The joy on Ranma's  face turned sour.  "Kuso, I'm going to  be late."  She kissed her husband.  "I'll tell you later, <i>anata</i>," she  said as she ran out the door.<br/>-</p><p>Sitting in his office, Marx was  busy catching up on security paperwork, including a new inventory of the  classified materials for the change of command inspection that was coming  up.  Glenn Miller and the Andrews  Sisters filled the house, keeping the middle-aged captain calm as he went about  his paperwork. Of course, he'd spent his first six months with the previous  custodian, maintaining the files the "wrong" way, and then the last six months  correcting two years of carelessness.   So it was no surprise that he finally heard the phone ringing on the  twentieth ring.  "Captain Marx, how may  I help you?"</p><p>"<i>Captain, this is Major  Rodriguez.  The wing commander would  like to see you, immediately.</i>"</p><p>"Understood, sir."  Marx hung up and closed his files, jotting a  quick note to his wife, telling her where he'd be.</p><p>After an exceedingly long and  grueling inquisition in the wing commander's office about "The Incident", Marx  returned to the home he shared with his young wife. Three months later, and the  accidental downing of an American and Russian fighter are suddenly issues.  He'd spent all day there, so by the time he  was walking up the walk, the sun was already below the horizon, the last rays  of light reflecting off the clouds.  He  noticed the lights in the house were off, the mail still sitting in the  mailbox.  He grabbed the mail, opened  the door and walked in.  "Taidama," he  shouted, but there was no response.   Setting the mail on the side table in the hall, Marx quickly walked  through the house, searching.  Yet his  young wife wasn't there.  The message on  the answering machine was from the school, wondering why Ranma wasn't in.  That piqued his interest.</p><p>Making a few calls of his own, Marx  was able to determine that his wife was nowhere on base—that quite possibly  their worst nightmare came true.  Her  father had abducted Ranma again.   Sitting at his desk, Marx picked up the phone.  He was dreading this call—one that had the same significance as  though he had to contact the next of kin.   "<i>35th Security Forces, Staff Sergeant Alvarado.  How may I help you sir/ma'am?</i>"</p><p>"Sergeant Alvarado, this is Captain  Marx.  I'd like to report a missing  person."</p><p>"<i>Standby, sir.</i>"  There was the rustling of papers, as the  staff sergeant on the end of the phone grabbed the appropriate forms.  "<i>Go ahead, sir.</i>"  Marx gave the pertinent information about  his wife, particularly identifying marks.   The scars of the Neko-ken training were fairly obvious, as would be her  fiery red hair.  "<i>Time last seen?</i>"</p><p>"Eight this morning, just before  she left for school."</p><p>"<i>Thank you, sir.  We'll get this disseminated throughout the  base and to the local authorities.  It's  possible that someone may have seen her and her abductor.</i>"</p><p>"Thank you Sergeant."  Marx sat the handset back in its cradle, and  sat at his desk, in the dark.<p>-<br/>A few hours earlier</p><p>Ranma was quickly running through  the residential areas of the base to the high school.  She'd left the house late, not figuring that trying to tell her  husband her good news would take so long, and decided that roof hopping  wouldn't be the healthiest thing for the baby.   So she was running, her long hair streaming behind her like a  banner.</p><p>That is until she ran into a  gi-clad brick wall.  Backing up, Ranma's  face paled when she saw who it was that was standing there.</p><p>Genma looked down at his  daughter.  "So, where are you off  to?  Going to shack up with your weak <i>amerikajin</i>?"  He snarled.   All his hard work and training to unite the two Schools of Anything Goes  and make his son the best fighter of all time ruined because Ranma had to fall  in the only permanent cursed spring that isn't fatal.</p><p>Ranma glared at her father, a fire  in her eyes.  "Weak?"  She repeated.  "I'll have you know that my husband is a warrior of the highest regard."  She settled into what had become her  customary stance when she sparred with JASDF's unarmed combat instructors.  <i>He's already starting with the verbal  attacks.  I've got to concentrate and  ignore what he's saying.</i>  She just  managed to duck under a snap kick to her head and swept her father's legs out  from under him.  "I guess you haven't  run into Mom.  I'm no longer a Saotome;  she kicked me out of the Clan because <i>you</i>  got me cursed and I wasn't a 'man amongst men', Oyaji!"</p><p>Startled by the truth, Genma hit  the ground hard, but years of training—particularly under the Dread Master—allowed  him to not only recover, but also connect with a particularly savage counter  kick.  The hit to Ranma should have been  fatal, would have been fatal, had it not been for her training with the  Amazons.  The kick still managed to  throw her back, slamming her head against the curb, knocking the redheaded  martial artist out and spider webbing the concrete curb.</p><p>The bald martial artist quickly  bound his daughter, then leapt over the fence, running as fast as he could to  get away from the base and to any available transport to Tokyo.</p><p>Ranma awoke to an unfamiliar sensation—a gentle  rocking back and forth, coupled with the mild vibration of a three cylinder  steam engine banging away belowdecks.   She looked around the darkened room, the only illumination coming from  the full moon streaming in through the porthole.  She tried to move, but found her limbs bound by ropes.  "Kuso, the old fool really doesn't want me  to escape," she muttered.  "Shibari  knots and stuck on a ship.  I'm  definitely not getting out of here until we dock."</p><p>Her father walked into the cabin, a  half-eaten chicken leg in his hand.   "So, you're finally awake.  Did  Sleeping Beauty enjoy her nap?" He sneered, taking a bite from the leg.</p><p>"Damnit Pops, you've gone too far  this time.  Chris'll have every cop in Japan  looking for me.  And why the hell are  you doing this?  Didn't the fact that  I'm not in the Clan anymore get through your thick skull?"</p><p>"Why's that?  He some sort of multimillionaire who plays  at being a fighter pilot?"  Genma glared  at his former son.  "You are still the  heir to Anything Goes.  And I am still  you sensei.  What I say, goes.  And you are coming to Tokyo  with me."</p><p>"Why won't you get it through your  thick skull.  I'm not a Saotome  anymore!"  Ranma all but screamed to her  father.  She placed her head back on the  bunk once more in frustration.  Her  father wasn't going to listen to her, no matter what she said or did.  Genma was stuck in his own little fantasy  world, and no amount of reality was going to penetrate that fantasy world.</p><p>Her sometimes panda of a father  grinned evilly at his redheaded daughter before he left the cabin.  "By the time we reach Tokyo,  I'll have you sufficiently broken," as he closed and locked the door.</p><p>Tears came unbidden at the corner  of her eyes, as Ranma had an inkling of what was possibly meant by her father.</p><p>Marx sat listening to the mission  briefing halfheartedly.  The past three  days since his wife's abduction had been sheer hell on the fighter pilot.  He'd lost his appetite, partially eating his  meals; his reaction times in the cockpit were down; and his commander and  element leader were beginning to worry about the mental health of the  middle-aged captain.  Major Wegner  looked at his notes as he finished up the operational side of the  briefing.  One of the things he'd asked  the cops was to be kept abreast of the search for Ranma.  And that included briefings from various  Japanese police agencies.  "Okay, some  news on the search for Mrs. Marx.   Misawa harbor police has a report from a longshoreman about someone  fitting her description being carried aboard an old Liberty  ship, now called the <i>Kobayashi Maru</i>.  The ship sailed from Misawa before the  police could get aboard, but the MSDF destroyer <i>Kongo</i> reported the ship sailing south at five knots."  Fuzz looked at the briefing notes he'd  received.  The National Police were  planning on staging a rescue mission while the Liberty Ship was at sea,  requesting the use of the 353rd Special Operations Squadron out of  Kadena through US Forces, Japan, unless the request was unsuccessful, then  Maritime or Air SDF units would be used.   "At this time," Wegner started, hating the lie he was about to say, "the  National Police are planning on a rescue mission utilizing Maritime or Air Self  Defense Force assets.</p><p>"And as per the Colonel, we are not  making this a joint operation, even though it would help to repair US/Japanese  relations, given the number of incidents that have occurred on Okinawa.  And Captain Marx, that means no volunteering  for this assignment as a liaison.   Understood?"</p><p>Marx nodded.  "Yes sir.   But…"</p><p>"No 'Buts', Captain.  If this mission goes as planned, then you  won't have to worry about your wife.   And we won't have to worry about you."</p><p>"Understood sir."  Marx wasn't happy with it, but had to go  along with his superior's orders.</p><p>"If there's nothing else, ladies  and gentlemen, then we have a training mission to fly."  Maj. Wegner closed his folder.  "Marx, can I speak with you for a moment?"</p><p>Telling his wingman to go on ahead,  Marx held up.  "What's up, sir?"</p><p>Wegner sat on the edge of the  desk.  "Captain, I know this has been an  extremely trying time for you, but I wanted to let you know that as soon as we  find anything out about the mission, you'll be the first to know.</p><p>"This whole damn kidnapping has  been an embarrassment for both the US  and Japan.  It doesn't look good to the media of both  nations that a Japanese national, married to an American serviceman, is  kidnapped from a joint-services installation and the authorities have damn near  nothing to go on.</p><p>"There's very little we can do at  this point, except hope that the police can handle it from their side.  And that means no playing cowboy.  Understood?"  Marx nodded.  "Good.  Maybe this news can help pull you out of  your downward slide."<p>-</p><p>Ranma was lying on the bunk in the  cabin, not that she had much choice in her current situation.  Her father still hadn't released the Shibari  knots, and probably wouldn't until they reached their destination.  Throughout the voyage, her father had hinted  that she'd become compliant, but the crew never took the panda up on his offers  to use his daughter.  They didn't like  the way that the redhead had been brought aboard, even though their captain had  a no questions asked policy.</p><p>Her arms and legs had gone numb  after the first couple of hours from being bound in such contorted  positions.  Her body was beginning to  suffer from dehydration and lack of vitamins and minerals; a depletion that was  being caused by her pregnancy as well as a lack of real food.  Her father felt that rice and water would  toughen his daughter back up, despite her protests about her pregnancy.  "If Oyaji did so much as harm my child, I'm  going to kill him," was her steady comment the three days they were at sea.</p><p>It was a dark night when the  redheaded martial artist woke up again.   Because of her bonds and lack of proper nutrition, she hadn't been  sleeping right.  Of course the possible  concussion she's had for the past three days might have had something to do  with it.  The moon, visible for the past  two nights, was covered by the leading edge of a storm system coming in from  China.  The rhythmic motion of the ship  started to rock the young wife back to sleep, but there was something else in  the background that woke her up—a distinct, heavy thump of rotors coming closer  then stationary over the ship.  The door  to her cabin burst in, and three men clad in black flightsuits rushed in.</p><p>"Marx-san," one of the black-clad  men asked, as a second slit the bonds holding her and the third kept an eye on  the passageway, "can you walk?"  She  shook her head as she tried to work the blood back into her tortured  limbs.  The masked man turned to his  comrades.  "We'll have to carry her  out," he said in English.  The one who  cut her bonds nodded and swept the redhead into a fireman's carry and out the  cabin.</p><p>On deck, Genma sat on the deck, his  hands bound.  Ranma gave her father an  annoyingly cute smile.  "I told you my  husband would move heaven and earth to get me back."</p><p>Her father looked at her.  "Ranma, my boy, you are going to bail your  father out, right?"</p><p>As she was placed in the Stokes  basket to be lifted up to the hovering Pave Low, Ranma snorted.  "First of all, Pops, I'm not your son.  You saw to that when you took us to  Jusenkyo.  Secondly, why should I bail  you out when this is your mess?  You  never learned something known as restraint.   And lastly, you're only my father by genetics.  Mom kicked me out of the Clan; I'm no longer bound by any deals  that you cut.  Learn from your mistakes,  Oyaji.  And I hope nothing you did hurt  my unborn child.  If it did, I'll file  murder charges against you so quickly, that your eyes will swim."  She looked at the pararescue jumpers around  the litter.  "I'd like to go home, now."</p><p>Bleary eyed, Marx reached for the  phone.  "Captain Marx," he mumbled into  the receiver.</p><p>"<i>Captain Marx, this is Sgt.  Kelley, Operations.  We have some good  news for you.  National Police and JASDF  operatives successfully retrieved your wife this morning at 0230 hours, local.</i>"</p><p>That information fully woke up the  middle aged pilot.  "Where is she?"</p><p>"<i>She's currently at the clinic  on Atsugi Air Facility, although the recovery team did not state her exact  condition.</i>"</p><p>"Thank you Sergeant."  Marx hung up the phone and placed his head  back on the pillow.  Sleep was far from  coming for Ranma's husband for this night.</p><p>Branch Medical Clinic, NAF Atsugi</p><p>With two sets of monitors beeping incessantly and an  IV pump whirring, Ranma slept fitfully.   The IVs were necessary because of the dehydration she suffered at the  hands of her father; the fetal monitor because of her still unborn child, the  adult monitor to make sure that there were no lasting effects of her  captivity.  At least physically.  The base social worker was impressed with  her mental recovery.  "How's she doing,"  Marx asked the nurse quietly from the door.   Her husband was still clad in his flightsuit from the flight down from  Misawa.</p><p>"She's a very resilient young  woman, Captain.  The IVs are just a  precaution to keep her fluids up, and the concussion hasn't stopped her.  We did an ultrasound when she arrived, as  well as the fetal monitoring.  As far we  can tell, your child is doing fine as well.   Just as resilient as her mother."</p><p>Marx walked into the room, and sat  down next to his wife.  Running his hand  through his wife's fiery locks, he quietly spoke in Japanese.  "Why didn't you tell me you were  pregnant?  Why didn't you let me drive  you to school?"</p><p>Ranma reached up and held on to her  husband's arm.  Replying in the same  language, she told him.  "I wanted to surprise  you, <i>anata</i>."  She opened her  liquid blue eyes, catching her husband's hazel and held them.  "Some surprise, eh?"</p><p>Marx patted her arm.  "It was," he chuckled sardonically.  "Let's not have it happen again, ok?"</p><p>"I doubt it will.  Genma is probably going to a zoo as part of  a panda breeding program."  The redhead  looked at her husband.  "Chris," she  asked, "should I make amends with my mother?"</p><p>Marx looked at his wife, his hand  clasping hers.  "That is your call, <i>aisuru</i>.  But what ever your decision is, I'll stand  by it and support it, one hundred percent.   Thanks to your mother's rash actions last year, you are legally an adult.  And being a mother might help in that  decision."</p>
