</div><p>An answer to Otakuboy's question on the ages of everyone here:</p><p>COL. Marx- 48<br/>Ranma- 32<br/>Saburo- 16<br/>Chris, Jr. - 10<br/>Nodoka- 10</p><p>oooooooooo</p><p>Morning arrived at the Marx household, not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, more like a groan. The sun streaming in through the window didn't help, as the head of the household groaned in the bliss of a hangover. "That'll be the last time I mix sake and champagne," he muttered. It felt like there was an anvil chorus banging away inside his head. He peeled an eye open, and whimpered as the sunlight hit his bloodshot eye.</p><p>He smiled (although it hurt like a dickens) that Ranma was also passed out on the bed. Marx was about to do something, when a tantalizing aroma tickled his nostrils. Throwing on his robe, Marx followed the smells to the kitchen, where Saburo was making breakfast.</p><p>"Morning Dad," Saburo said, from the stove. "Coffee's already made and waiting for you."</p><p>"Thanks, Saburo." Marx poured himself a cup, then took the sugar and did a 3 to 5 second pour. Taking a sip, he could feel the anvil chorus receding, or at least dropping in volume from forte to piano. "Son, what happened last summer?"</p><p>"Why do you ask, Dad?" Saburo set his father's fried eggs in front of him.</p><p>"Because your Aunt, and sponsor for those visas, told your mother something interesting. Something about a Kiss."</p><p>"Crap," the eldest son muttered. "I didn't think it was that serious," he said in his defense. "Hell, we're Amazons by adoption; I didn't think the Kiss of Marriage should have applied."</p><p>"Apparently Rinse decided to ignore our family's status and grant Tigar's Kiss." Marx took a sip of coffee, as he read his son's reactions. "It was fortunate that your Aunt was raised to an Elder when Cologne died. She suspended it, at least for the time being."</p><p>"At least she's still in the village." Saburo saw the look on his father's face. "Is she?"</p><p>Marx smirked, as he placed an index finger against his lower lip. "That…is a secret. Are your brother and sister up?"</p><p>"Yes sir. They're outside sparring."</p><p>"Ok." Marx finished his cup of coffee and eggs. He looked out the window and saw a nondescript Toyota sitting across from the apartment. "This is going to be interesting."</p><p>"What's that, Dad?"</p><p>"Protective Services wants to detail guards for you, your brother and sister, and your mother."</p><p>"Great," Saburo muttered. "Don't they know we can protect ourselves?"</p><p>"I know that, your mother knows that, you know that, but the Embassy doesn't know that. It's bad enough we have a surveillance unit watching the apartment."</p><p>"So, I'm going to have a shadow with me at school?" His father nodded. "So much for meeting kids my own age."</p><p>Marx nodded again. "Your mother will be taking Chris and No-chan to their school."</p><p>"So that means you'll be coming with me?" Marx made an affirmative noise around his second cup of coffee. "Great."</p><p>Juuban High School was your typical Japanese secondary school, with your generally typical Japanese high school students. Which, for the faculty, was grateful for. Which also meant none of the levels of weirdness that Furinkan High, Tomobiki High, or even Okayama High, down in Okayama Prefecture.</p><p>Juuban, as a whole, however, had its own weirdness levels that more than made up for the relative normalcy of the high school. According to both urban legend and <i>Weird Tokyo</i>, Juuban was the home to the Sailor-suited Defenders of Love and Justice. That put it on par with Nerima and its panty thief, and Tomobiki with its tiger-striped bikini-clad lass chasing after her perverted fiancé. Supposedly Minato-ku was one of those wards that Godzilla avoided, along with Nerima and Tomobiki.</p><p>So when the Embassy limo pulled up in front of the high school, there was quite a commotion. Saburo and his father climbed out of the back of the Cadillac El Dorado, as Saburo's escort climbed out of the front. Marx motioned for the Protective Service agent to relax, although if someone looked closely, they'd be able to see the outline of his service automatic beneath his jacket.</p><p>The trio walked into the school, with a buzz of voices behind them. It wasn't everyday they saw an American Colonel, let alone just an American, walk into the school. They made their way to the school office, where they were intercepted by the principal's secretary. "May I help you?"</p><p>"We have an appointment with Kuno-san," Marx said. "Saburo Marx and father."</p><p>"Let me check." She looked at Principal Kuno's schedule. "Ah, I see. Let me make sure he's in, and not at the Kendo hall." She picked up the phone and buzzed the inner office. "Hai. Your eight o'clock is here, sir. I'll send them." Mrs. Tachigumi looked at the Americans in front of her. "Principal Kuno will see you now."</p><p>"Thank you. Marx entered the Principal's office, only to be stopped by a bokken tip against his chest.</p><p>"Halt! You are? But wait! Isn't it proper to introduce one's self first?</p><p>"I am Tatewaki Kuno, Principal of Juuban High, and star of the national Kendo circuit—known to my peers as the Blue Thunder!" There was a crash of lightening outside the windows, odd on an otherwise clear day.</p><p>Marx looked at the person holding him back, grateful that he was fluent in Japanese. Gregory, the Protective Service agent, didn't understand a word that was said, but looked ready to draw his pistol at any time. The Colonel cleared his throat, and entered his "Squadron Commander from Hell" mode. "I am Colonel Christopher Marx, defense attaché to the US Ambassador. And if you're not careful, I'll see that my son is the last student that attends this school from the US Embassy, or any other embassy." The bokken lowered, and that allowed Marx to relax a little and take in the Principal's office. His "Love Me" wall was full of pictures of himself—winning the prefecture and nationals in high school, as captain of the Todai kendo team, his wedding photos, which showed a crying long-haired man hugging Kuno; and a photo of scowling woman about Ranma's age.</p><p>"Well, Colonel, it seems that your son had an excellent record at Summit High School, scholastically speaking." Kuno's change in attitude pulled Marx out of his evaluation that Principal Kuno was and egomaniacal whack job. "However, here at Juuban High, we pride ourselves on our extremely low delinquency rate—something my father tried to do at Furinkan, but wasn't successful." Kuno launched into a Colonel Klink-esque spiel about how Stalag 13…er, Juuban High was the best public school system in the Tokyo Metropolitan area. "Mr. Marx," Kuno said finally addressing Saburo, "because I am a fair man, as well as a martial artist, anything that you feel might be a threat to your honor, advise the faculty before responding to the challenge. Agreed?"</p><p>"Hai, Sensei," Saburo replied.</p><p>"Very good. Enjoy your stay here."</p><p>"Thank you, sensei," Saburo replied, as he left taking Gregory in tow. Marx nodded respectfully to Kuno and left as well.</p><p>Saburo got to his classroom, and found a seat near the back. His curiosity was piqued by the cloaked figure two rows up and across from him. The homeroom teacher walked in right as the late bell rang. "Good morning class. We have two new students joining us today. Will they stand and come forward?" Saburo and the cloaked figure stood and moved to the front of the classroom. "First off, from the Qinghai Autonomous Province of China, Tigar. Everyone give her a big 'Nihao' welcome." Saburo shuddered when he heard her name, and couldn't believe the irony. Standing next to him was his Amazon Law "wife".</p><p>"Nihao," she said, keeping it simple, and not removing the hood of her cloak..</p><p>"And from the United States," under the hood, Tigar's ears perked up, "Saburo Marx"</p><p>"Ano…" Saburo was interrupted by a five-foot nothing catgirl grabbing on to his arm, shouting "Wo Ai Ni, Airrren!" and purring like a giant housecat. The entire class was shocked, to say the least, when Tigar's hood fell down, revealing the cat ears on the top of her head.</p><p>Tigar, for her part, ignored the sudden murmuring of voices in the classroom. She'd found her airen in her classroom, like Elder Xian Pu had said. Being raised by Rinse and Mousse (before <i>his</i> fall into the Nyanniichuan), she'd seen how the overly amorous and blind Hidden Weapon's expert showed his affection to Xian Pu. And in her mind, that was how one showed their affections, despite the fact that Shampoo told her otherwise. Saburo, on the other hand, went into mental shutdown, as he felt his arm between a pair of soft mounds.</p><p>oooooooooo</p><p>Marx was just finishing his coffee, as his deputy, chief of staff, and Maj. Nagase walked in. "Good morning, sir," Lt. McConnell said. Nagase nodded, and LCDR Lowe gave the Colonel a perfunctory grunt.</p><p>"Gentlemen, Major," Marx replied. He motioned them to take their seats, and offered the usual coffee and pastries. Once everyone was settled, Marx began his first real staff meeting. "It seems that there are some issues down at Camp Butler," he began, opening the folder sitting on his desk.</p><p>"What kind of issues, Colonel?"</p><p>"The ones involving the local population, and put the US military in a negative light."</p><p>"Sir," Commander Lowe said, "that is the prerogative of PACOM, not us."</p><p>"You are correct, Commander. But, as the Defense Department's liaison to State, it is the responsibility of this office to brief the Ambassador of any potential recriminations that would result from our 'meddling' in internal affairs." Marx leaned forward, resting his arms on his desk. "I recall several incidents that occurred with service members on Okinawa, which cast our government in a negative light. I would rather not have repeats of those incidents."</p><p>"Well then, Colonel, what are you proposing?" The Commander asked, not liking where this was going.</p><p>"Since the staff here is independent of Pacific Command, my recommendation is that we form an independent investigating body, not affiliated with Pacific Command, to provide this office with enough information to advise the Ambassador on an appropriate course of action."</p><p>"Sir," Commander Lowe asked, "what is an 'appropriate course of action'?"</p><p>"Whether or not to allow the military to try the individual responsible in a military court, or declare him <i>persona non grata</i>, and allow him to be tried in the civilian courts."</p><p>"What?" LCDR Lowe all but shouted. "A US service member…"</p><p>"Is not above the law of a host nation, Commander." Marx's tone of voice reminded Lowe that he was an O-4 and not an O-6. "Yes, the Cold War is still with us, even though the Soviet Union is gradually seeing that Communism is a failure, we have to remember that this is not the 1960s, when our boys could do whatever they wanted and get away with a wrist slapping."</p><p>"Colonel, I must protest! This office is to provide diplomatic liaison between JCS and the host nation's military, as well as provide a safe haven for US military personnel."</p><p>"Commander, you are out of line," Marx said quietly. "Times are changing, albeit slowly. We need to change with it. The Soviet Union will not always be our immediate focus. Look at we've done in Afghanistan after twenty years of hunting Al-Qaeda."</p><p>"Colonel," Major Nagase said, "I'll take your proposal up to my superiors. Perhaps we can circumvent Pacific Command's intervention and make it look like the request came from the General Staff."</p><p>"Auspicious thinking Major," Marx replied. "How will the average Japanese citizen react to this information? And how receptive will they be to one of our investigators?"</p><p>"Difficult to gauge, sir. The Japanese have been living with an occupation army for almost eighty years. They're used to seeing American soldiers getting away with almost virtual murder for three generations. It'll be hard for them to change their attitudes.</p><p>"As for embassy investigators, I'm sure you know how tight-lipped most Japanese are when dealing with foreigners. What I can do, is perhaps add in to the proposal that a member of my staff accompany your investigators, as both translator and a second set of eyes and ears."</p><p>"Excellent idea, Major. And thank you for your candor," Marx said. "Is there any other business?" And with that statement, the day's work in the defense attaché's began.</p><p>oooooooooo</p><p>Saburo sat outside his guidance counselor's office. His first day of school and it hadn't gone as well as he'd expected. He'd discovered that his Amazon fiancée was in the same class as he, in fact starting school at Juuban the same day. It wouldn't have been a big problem, except that she had been raised by Great Aunt Cologne's chief rival-Rinse, who never really recognized Ranma's adoption into the tribe, and therefore claimed Tigar's Kiss legitimate.</p><p>The door to the office opened, and Tigar came out, cloak in hand. Saburo braced himself for another glomp, and was surprised when she didn't. "Counselor will see you now, Airrren," she said. Her tail, sticking out from under her fuku, was twitching, showing her irritation. "Tigarrr see you at lunch?"</p><p>Saburo cleared his throat, and replied in rusty Mandarin. "Only if shamed Amazon not show affection like before."</p><p>Tigar smiled and replied in the same language. "I underrrstand, and will behave." She may be an Amazon warrior, and one of the best trackers in the tribe, raised by an ultra-orthodox Elder, but Shampoo's influence and liberal, cat-like attitudes appealed to the catgirl more than Rinse's.</p><p>"Mr. Marx," the counselor called, in English, "come in."</p><p>"Hai Sensei," Saburo replied, leaving Tigar to head back to the classroom. He entered the office and closed the door, taking in the surroundings—something his father taught him to do. No photos of family or loved ones, only her Bachelors and Master's Degrees from Todai, her doctorate in history from Oxford, and her doctorate in clinical social work from Georgetown. "You wanted to see me," he asked standing in front of her desk.</p><p>Setsuna arched a delicate green eyebrow. "Wanted to, Marx-san; no. Had to, because of your Amazon wife, yes."</p><p>"Sensei, because my mother is an adopted Amazon, my 'marriage' to Tigar was suspended by my Aunt," Saburo replied, a fire in his eyes.</p><p>"Yes, I know. Tigar has already told me about it. What I'd like to know is what goals you have, and does following through on your…arranged marriage count towards those goals."</p><p>"Well, Meiou-sensei," Saburo began, "I haven't really thought about the future. Both my parents are educators, so I've thought about going in that direction."</p><p>Setsuna interrupted for a minute. "I thought your father was defense attaché at the Embassy?"</p><p>"He is," Saburo clarified. "His degrees are in history, with a specialization in secondary education. Dad was a history teacher before he returned to active duty."</p><p>"I see." Setsuna was actually surprised at this, but it was understandable, since she used the Gates mainly to ensure no threats against the creation of Crystal Tokyo. "So you're thinking about a career in education. Very admirable. Any particular field?"</p><p>"Well, I'm a martial artist, ma'am, so I might focus on physical education, like my mother, but my dad's turned me into something of a history buff, so I might want to follow in Dad's footsteps. I don't know yet."</p><p>"Understandably, Saburo," Setsuna replied. "But let me ask you this: Do any of your goals have your 'wife' in them?"</p><p>"Meiou-sensei, I would like to marry whomever I choose to—not forced into marriage because of an untenable situation like my mother. If I happen to choose Tigar, then so be it. If it's another, then I hope Tigar can understand."</p><p>"Very mature attitude, Marx-san."</p><p>"Well, losing your father for five months when you're six tends to require one to mature quickly."</p><p>"I'm sure it can," Setsuna replied, as she wrote out his pass back to class.</p><p>oooooooooo</p><p>Saburo returned to class, and half-heartedly listened to the lesson—it was a history lesson on the war in Afghanistan, and the success in establishing a free, democratically elected, and pro-Western nation on the borders of the Soviet Union. Saburo knew more about the allied Operation Enduring Freedom, since his father's squadron was deployed there five years ago, to patrol the Afghan-Tadzik border. He was spared from the instructor's nasal monotone by the ringing of the bell. Saburo smiled and did something his mother really frowned on at Summit—he vaulted out the fourth story window to, to the astonished looks and voices of his classmates.</p><p>He found a tree, away from the hubbub of the other students, and quickly occupied the space underneath it. Saburo noticed a blonde with Amazon-style odangos "holding court" with apparently three of her friends—one of whom was in his class.</p><p>Tigar saw him and wandered over, ignoring the looks of her fellow students. <i>It's like they've never seen a catgirl before</i>, she thought as she approached Saburo. "Nihao, Airrren," she purred, as she settled down in the grass, adjusting her fuku as not to flash anyone behind her.</p><p>"Nihao, Tigar," Saburo replied. "How come you took off your cloak?"</p><p>"Guidance counselorrr said it not parrrt of drrress code," she replied, as she pulled out her bento and opened the box. "Mmm," she purred, "tuna."</p><p>Saburo smiled. He remembered meeting Tigar five years ago, during his first visit to his Aunt's village, and learning about her love for fish. They got into a scuffle back then, and just about once a week, sometimes more. Even though she kept quiet about it, Shampoo had an inkling that Rinse has seen that first scuffle and decided then and there that when it was time, she'd ensure that Tigar would be defeated by Saburo.</p><p>Last summer was the first time that all three Marx children went to the Joketsuzoku for formal training under Amazon masters. Ranma had been training Chris and Nodoka in Amazon Wu Shu, so they had a basis for when they went. True to her school, Ranma had incorporated it into her school of Anything Goes, officially recognized by the head of the Saotome Clan, and by default Saotome School.</p><p>Saburo wouldn't admit it, but he had developed a crush on the catgirl four years ago. So as much as he'd put up a good front in front of his parents, he was glad she was here. Of course, he also had Jenny back in the States, and really didn't want to end that relationship. Which stuck him smack dab in the middle of a love triangle—something he really had wanted to avoid. "Tigar," he said, "would you…what would…"</p><p>"Airrren, I know you have girrrl back in Amerrrica. I'm not stupid. Norrr am I blind like newborrrn kitten. We see what kind of currrve ball Aphrrrodite thrrrows ourrr way." Without thinking of the consequences, Tigar did what she did back in the village when they were tired after playing or sparring: she curled up next to Saburo, and dozed off. For his part, Saburo's hand automatically began scratching behind her ears, which elicited a typical catty response from the catgirl—a loud purring.</p><p>Over where the "court" was, Minako Aino looked over at the couple. "Aw, aren't they cute," the Senshi of Love gushed.</p><p>Usagi and the others looked over. "Who are they? Are they new here?"</p><p>Ami answered. "The son of the new US defense attaché, Saburo Marx; and the ward of the new Chinese Ambassador, Tigar."</p><p>"He looks like…"</p><p>Ami held up her hand, interrupting Makoto. "Don't say, Mako-chan. Tigar is supposedly a Chinese Amazon. I did a little research with the Mercury Computer during history. And I won't go into all the history of the Amazons, but they have this 'Kiss of Marriage' law where if an outsider male defeats an Amazon, she is bound by law to give him the Kiss.</p><p>"And the way Tigar shouted 'Nihao Airen!' this morning, tells me Saburo-san defeated her."</p><p>"So," Makoto asked.</p><p>"There's a corollary to both their Kiss of Marriage and Kiss of Death laws—if an obstacle gets in the way, remove it. Permanently."</p><p>"Oh," the Senshi of Jupiter replied dejectedly. "All the good ones are either taken or gay," she muttered. Minako nodded in agreement, as Ami and Usagi shared a knowing look at the perpetually dateless duo.</p><p>Saburo sat there scratching Tigar in that secret spot behind a cat's ears the gets them purring, when the bell rang. "Tigar," he said, "time to go back to class."</p><p>Her response was typical cat. "Don'wanna; comfy," she purred.</p><p><i>Great</i>, Saburo thought.<i> Of course, if we do get married, at least we started out as friends</i>. "Looks like want to be difficult," he muttered. He scooped up the Amazon catgirl and made his way to the classroom—via the window ledges.</p><p>Tigar, not feeling solid ground under her, woke up and saw what Saburo was doing—not before almost twisting out of his grasp.</p><p>Saburo merely smiled at her, and tightened his grip. But she still twisted at the wrong moment.</p><p>Tigar's movement threw Saburo's balance off just enough, that as he placed his foot on the ledge to their classroom, it slipped off the narrow concrete sill. "Kuso!" Saburo shouted as he threw Tigar up in the air. Gravity reasserted itself, pulling the martial artist back down, as the late bell rang.</p><p>"Whee!" Tigar shouted, as she adjusted herself in midair to at least land on all fours.</p><p>Saburo, on the other hand, found himself landing flat on his back, creating a nice Wile E. Coyote-style crater. "Ite!" He moaned from the bottom of the hole.</p><p>"Oof," Tigar let out, as she landed. "That was fun! Let's do it again!"</p><p>All Saburo could see was blue sky, clouds, and his classmates, albeit faintly. He climbed out of the Saburo-shaped crater, feeling very much like a certain <i>lupus ludicrous</i>, and also very glad that Auntie Shampoo trained him in the Breaking Point Technique. Tigar had this happy look on her face, as he led her back up to the classroom. The teacher, with a scowl on her face looked at the two coming in late. "Buckets, hall—now."</p>
