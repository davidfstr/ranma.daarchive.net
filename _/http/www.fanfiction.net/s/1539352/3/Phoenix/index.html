</div><p>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer</p><p>As she napped, Ranma dreamt.  It was a nightmare she'd had before.  Her father, looming larger than life, was  saying how this new technique would make her an unbeatable martial artist is  she would just learn it.  "You are a  useless girl, Ranma.  Weak and useless,"  he scolded.</p><p>"No, Poppa, I want to learn.  But I don't wanna go back in the pit."  The pathetic mewling of half-starved cats  could be heard from the covered pit.</p><p>"You're whining like a girl, Ranma;  a pathetic, frilly, weak little girl.   The only way you're going to earn your keep is by learning this  technique.  Back into the pit with you."</p><p>"No Poppa.  I'm not a girl; I wanna be the best martial  artist in the world.  But I don wanna go  back in there!"  Super-Genma picked his  daughter up by the arm and threw her back into the pit.  "Poppa, <i>no</i>!"  She screamed in terror as she flew towards  the now open pit, as it grew razor sharp teeth and evil green eyes.</p><p>Her scream woke Marx up, as well as her hot tears on  her chest.  Ranma wept openly, clutching  her fiancé in a death grip.  "No  Poppa.  I'm not a girl; I wanna be the  best martial artist in the world.  But I  don wanna go back in there!  Poppa, <i>no</i>!"  She mumbled in her sleep.  "I'm not worthless."</p><p>"Shh," he whispered.  "You're right, you're not worthless; you  mean something to someone very close to you."   Marx lay there, stroking his fiancée's hair, calming her down.  She snuffled lightly, and moved on to more  pleasant dreams.  Twilight filled the  dorm room with shadows.  "If this was  something your father did to you, I <i>will</i> make him pay.  I don't care if he is a martial artist; he  will pay."</p><p>"Ranma, what happened during your training?  You've been having nightmares, and it's a  reoccurring one at that," Marx asked at dinner one night.</p><p>She sighed and set her chopsticks  down.  "Oyaji used a lot of 'unusual'  training techniques.  Having wolves set  upon me to make me run faster; tying me to the back of a freight train to teach  endurance; leaving me out in the woods while he gorges himself on food and sake  to teach survival.  All his harebrained  ideas seemed to work, except one.  And  that was the worst of them all—the Neko-ken."</p><p>"What kind of technique is that?"  Marx asked, gently prodding his fiancée to  clear the air between them.</p><p>"Its one where the master takes his  student, usually around 6 or 7, ties him up with fish sausages, and throws him  into a pit of half-starved cats.  In  theory, the student is supposed to teach the student to become like a cat.  But in practice it gives the student, namely  me, a severe fear of cats.  I can't even  be in the same room as one of those little devils without going crazy.  Because of that, the technique's been banned  for years."</p><p>"He is so dead," Marx growled.</p><p>"Good luck.  That damned panda created two very special  techniques for his hobby, but refused to teach them to me."</p><p>Marx smirked.  "I'll find away.  I can be very resourceful."</p><p>"I'm sure you are," Ranma said as  she smiled in that annoyingly cute manner of hers.  "So what do you have planned for after dinner tonight?"</p><p>Marx reached across the table and  stroked her face.  "That all depends on  you."</p><p>Morning found Marx out on Misawa's flightline, looking  the worse for wear.  "Damn, Scooter, you  look like shit.  What happened to you  last night?"</p><p>Marx gave his friend and wingman a  weary look.  "Doc, you've always known  I'm not one to kiss and tell."</p><p>1LT Brian Cobb punched his wing  leader in the shoulder.  "You don't have  to, Scooter.  I could hear you two last  night.  So who is she?"</p><p>"She's a girl I met a couple of  days ago."</p><p>"Damn you're moving quick.  So, tell me more."</p><p>"Not gonna do it, Doctor.  But I do have a favor to ask."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>Marx sighed.  "I'd like you to stand as a witness."</p><p>"You're not being sued are  you?"   Marx shook his head.  "Then…oh dear God, don't tell me you're  marrying this chick already?"  The older  lieutenant nodded.  "Why?  It's only Wednesday, you probably just met  her last Friday."</p><p>Marx leaned against the fuselage of  his fighter.  "Two very good  reasons:  One is sort of complicated;  her father is an abusive drunk who'd do I don't know what to her or prostitute  her for booze money.  The second, and  most important, is that her mother disowned her and kicked her out of the  Clan.  You should know how the Japanese  are about family and family honor.  No  family, no nothing."</p><p>"Oh man, Scooter, I didn't  know.  Yeah, sure, I'll stand as a  witness for you.  But you still need one  more."</p><p>"I was thinking about asking  Barney."</p><p>"Captain Miller?"  The pilot in question was the daughter of an  NYPD detective and was, in her own way, a reminder to everyone in the squadron  of the fictional Barney Miller.  "You  think she'll go for it?"</p><p>Marx chuckled.  "You've been on alerts with her, so you know  how she likes those sappy romance novels.   So here's a real life romance novel for her."</p><p>"I doubt it, but with Barney, you  never know.  Go ask her."</p><p>"Gentleman," Major Thompson called,  "are we flying or having a coffee break?"</p><p>"Flying sir!"  They both said as they climbed into their  fighters.</p><p>Marx stood in the men's room of the  base chapel, adjusting his tie for the umpteenth time.  There was nothing wrong with it or his  Class-A uniform.  "Scooter," Cobb said,  "relax.  It's not like you haven't been  through this before."</p><p>Marx looked at his long time  friend.  "I know.  It's just that it's been awhile, and I have  butter—aw, hell.  I have F-106s in my  stomach.  I'm nervous."</p><p>"Scoot…Chris, believe me.  You'll be fine."</p><p>"Thanks Brian."  Marx clapped his hand on his friend's  shoulder.  "Let's go get hitched."</p><p>They walked into the chapel, Ranma  and Captain Miller followed a few minutes later.  The ceremony was a brief, simple affair—more of a justice of the  peace type as opposed to a full ceremony.   Regardless of the type, with the recitation of vows, Ranma shed the lack  of a family name even though they had used "Masaki" as her maiden name.</p><p>The reception was a small affair as  well at the Officer's Club; basically a few squadron mates, Marx's crew chief,  and a few of the cops partially because of the speed involved, and partially to  keep costs down.  Colonel Bell, the  squadron commander, granted his oldest lieutenant a 96-hour pass for the  honeymoon.</p><p>It was fortunate that Marx had an  associate in the prefecture office that owed him a favor.  Marx called that marker in, and by the time  the newlyweds were on their way back from the honeymoon, a new set of identity  papers bearing the name "Ranma Masaki" were on their way to the Lieutenant's  mailbox, which allowed them to get Ranma her dependent ID card.</p><p>Friday morning found the  Marxs in the principal's office of the base high school; Ranma was looking  particularly nervous.  It was the first  time since that all boys' school, where she met Ryouga, that her education was  formalized.  The principal looked over  her new student's home schooling records.   "Mrs. Marx, these circumstances are unusual in that you have no  formalized school records from anywhere, and you are, I believe the first  married woman to be admitted to this high school.  However, based on your scores, I would place you in the junior  class; but at this late date, I feel that the sophomore class would be more  appropriate."  Marx translated as best  as he could for his wife, so that Ranma could understand what was being  said.  "Now, I understand that you've  studied martial arts for the past ten years. That will pretty much exempt you  from taking a physical fitness class.   But, I want you to understand that there is no fighting on school  grounds."</p><p>"Hai, sensei," she said.  "What if it is in response to a formal challenge, though?"</p><p>The principal looked at the  redhead.  "If it's a challenge, then  bring it to the attention of faculty.   I'm sure something can be arranged at that point."</p><p>Ranma was standing at her  locker, looking over her class schedule the following Monday.  "I feel so overwhelmed," she muttered.</p><p>The girl next to her overheard er  comment.  "I take it you've never been  to a Western-style school before?"  She  asked in fluent Japanese.  A slightly  wide-eyed Ranma shook her head.  "Gomen,  I forgot to introduce myself.  I'm  Angelica O'Brien."</p><p>"R-Ranma Marx."</p><p>"Pleased to meet you, Ranma.  First day of school as a sophomore?"  Ranma nodded.  "Do you know where you're going?"</p><p>"No.  I was shown around Friday by the principal, but…it's just so  overwhelming.</p><p>"Can I take a look at your  schedule, I can probably help you out."</p><p>"Thanks."  Ranma handed her schedule to her classmate.  As Angelica looked over Ranma's schedule,  Ranma asked her where she learned to speak fluently.</p><p>"My grandfather taught me.  He was a Japanese interpreter for President  Roosevelt's Secretary of State, Cordell Hull."   She handed the schedule back to Ranma.   "You're in the same classes as I am, so we can walk together, if that's  all right with you."</p><p>"Hai.  Thank you." With the ring of the first bell, Ranma's first day in  an American school started.</p><p>At lunch, Ranma placed her head on  her books, and sighed.  "Is this what  it's like in the States?  I swear, my  brain hurts."</p><p>Angelica looked at her new friend  sympathetically.  "It is, Ranma.  This is a usual pace, although I'm what they  call an 'Air Force' brat.  I've been to  several Tactical Air Command bases since I was born, I've been to Europe, so I  technically haven't been to a civilian high school, the pace and setup are  still pretty much the same."</p><p>"Kuso," the redhead muttered.</p><p>"So, it looks like we have  ourselves a new student," a gruff voice said from behind the two girls  said.  "And she looks kinda cute."</p><p>Angelica spun around in her  chair.  Standing over the two girls was  the captain of the school soccer team, and a few of his mates.  "Virgil," she said, "Ranma's not interested."</p><p>"You know not to call me 'Virgil',  Angie, only 'Gus'.  And why don't I hear  if from her mouth, anyway?  Or are you  two already an 'item'?"</p><p>The look Angelica was giving the  senior could have frozen water at 30 paces.   "One: We are not an 'item', Virgil.   And two; Ranma is struggling with her English, she's Japanese."</p><p>Ranma looked at her new friend  trying to protect her, and also sized up the competition.  "I'll handle this, Angelica," she said in  Japanese.  She thought about what she  was going to say as she stood, and switched to English.  "Fuck you, asshole," she said while smiling  cutely, in an "I know how to kick your ass" manner.</p><p>"Why, you little Jap bitch," Virgil  growled.  He grabbed Ranma by her  shoulders and picked her up.  "When I'm  through with you…"</p><p>"Big mistake," she said, in  Japanese.  Quicker than a pissed off  rattlesnake, Ranma jabbed the bigger teenager in the ribs, causing him to drop  the redheaded martial artist.  Ranma  then drove her knee into the soccer player's crotch, causing him to drop to the  floor.  With their soccer captain taken  out by this little girl, the teammates behind him pick him up and carried him  over to the nurse's office.</p><p>"This isn't over yet, you little  slant-eyed dyke.  I'll get you for  this.  You and your little friend  too!"  Virgil squeaked.</p><p>"Wasn't that a little over the  edge?"  Angelica asked, in a bit of awe  with her new classmate.</p><p>"Nah.  The jerk had it coming to him." Ranma said, as she poked at what  the cafeteria staff called "lunch".   "Man this stuff should be used for a science project.  I swear it's alive."</p><p><i>Oh, boy.  I hope she realizes she just beat up the  base commander's son.  I feel sorry for  whomever her sponsor is when General Leonard finds out.</i>  Angelica said to herself.</p><p>Ranma was approaching the exit  doors with the rest of the throng of kids to leave the school, when her husband  pulled up in his antique jeep.  Since  only English was spoken in the school, the former pigtailed martial artist was  forced to rely on her weak skills in that language, but they were steadily improving.  Without the steady badgering of her father,  Ranma was able to turn her impressive ability to learn martial arts towards her  education, especially since she was able to sleep at night, without fear of her  father trying something stupid or dragging her off to continue training.  Her husband climbed out, and waited for  her.  Ranma waved to him, and Marx waved  back.  "Ranma, who is that?  Is that your father?"  Asked one of her new friends.</p><p>She tried to stifle a chuckle, but  it came out choked.  "No,  Angelica."  She gave her friend a  smile.  "You know those rings I wear—the  one with the diamond, and the plain white gold band?"  Her friend nodded.  Ranma  pointed at the guy leaning against the fender of the Jeep.  "Well…they're my engagement and wedding  rings.  Lt. Marx isn't my father; he's  my husband."</p><p>Angelica barely kept her books from  dropping.  "You're kidding me,  right?  Does the school know?  My father's his crew chief, I had no idea, "</p><p>Ranma sighed, and had a wistful  look on her face.  "No, I'm not kidding  you.  And yes, the school knows."  She got serious again.  "He proposed to me the day after he met  me.  I had some…family problems, so I  ran away.  I was out in the cold during  that first snowfall; ready to give up, when he rescued me.  And because of my family problems, he  offered to help me escape them by becoming his wife.  I guess I was still sick, because I accepted."</p><p>"Ranma, just what kind of family  problems were you having?"  Angelica  asked.</p><p>"My father was…is a superb martial  artist, but a total moron when it comes to parenting.  For ten years of my life, he abused me in the name of 'training'.  Most of it was mental, but some was also physical."</p><p>"Couldn't the authorities do  anything about it?"</p><p>"They tried, Angie, but he always  managed to steal me back."</p><p>"So are you sure that he won't be  able to do anything with you on the base?"</p><p>Ranma chuckled.  "My darling husband has accounted for that  already.  He's already advised the cops  about him, passed around a picture of my dear father to them.  I have better hopes with the Security Forces  here on Misawa than I ever did with the local authorities."</p><p>"I hope he won't, Ranma.  You sure took the steam out of Virgil and  his cronies today at lunch.  Sorry, you  had to get in trouble though."</p><p>"I've, a…met their type  before.  Just the proper application of  a gentle knee to the crotch will dissuade them from harassing you.  And if that doesn't tell them that you're  not interested, I can always teach you some basic kempo.  That'll definitely get their attention then.  Why did he think we were an item?"</p><p>"I've spurned Virgil's advances  since my mother was transferred here when I was in eighth grade.  So he thinks I'm a lesbian because I don't  fall for his 'manly man' routine.  His  father was a missile wing commander in SAC before being assigned her as the  base commander.  He probably gets his  attitude from his father."</p><p>"Sounds like something my mother  would have thought," Ranma muttered, to low for her new friend to hear.</p><p>"So, you'd really teach me martial  arts?"  Ranma nodded.  "That's great."  Angelica hugged her classmate.   "I'll see you tomorrow."  Ranma  returned the hug and let her friend run to catch the bus.</p><p>Marx smiled at his wife.  "Good day at school today?"</p><p>She kissed him, before  answering.  "Hi darling.  Sort of.   I kinda got into another fight today.    But it wasn't my fault."</p><p>He climbed in after his young  wife.  "How so?"  He asked, as he started the jeep up and  pulled out of the school lot.</p><p>"A couple of the seniors started  making passes at a few of my classmates and me.  I told them to leave us alone; one of them made the mistake of  grabbing me."</p><p>"So I heard.  The school called me to tell me about it,  and Colonel Bell got on me about it, because <i>he</i> got a call from the base  commander."  Marx said.  "I explained to him that it was probably an  issue of self-defense.  Please, just  don't let it happen again, especially if it's the son of the base commander  that's involved.  Ok?"  Ranma nodded as they pulled up in front of  their house.</p><p>"I'll go get dinner ready," she  said, climbing out of the jeep.  Marx  nodded, and followed her in after grabbing the mail, then headed to his office  to check his email.</p><p>Standing in the kitchen with the  refrigerator door open, trying to decide what to make.  She'd already started a pot of water boiling  for soup, and the wok was warming.  She  got a smile on her face, and started pulling out vegetables, rice, a couple of  eggs, and chicken.  Remembering some of  the dishes she learned in China, she began preparing dinner.</p><p>Sitting at his computer, Marx  sniffed the air.  His nose was assaulted  by tantalizing aromas coming from the kitchen.   Giving up on his work for the moment, he stood and walked out of the  home office.  The formal dining room was  set in traditional Japanese style, while the kitchen had a homier, Western set  up.  Marx walked into the kitchen, and  saw his wife still cooking.  He slipped  up behind her…and got a spatula across the face.  "Damn, that smarts," he muttered.</p><p>Ranma saw what she did to her  husband and cringed.  "Gomen, but you  shouldn't have snuck up on me like that."</p><p>"I know, I know.  So when's dinner going to be ready?"</p><p>"In a few minutes.  Oh, Chris, about that senior that tried to  make a pass at me that I told you about earlier on the way home?"  Marx nodded, as he set the kitchen table.  "Well, he called me a—how did he say it…ah,  yes—'a little Jap bitch,' and a 'slant-eyed dyke.'  And he also insinuated that one of my classmates was a lesbian,  and my lover."</p><p>The glass in her husband's hand  fell from his suddenly numb hand.  Ranma  saw this, and dove to catch it.  With  millimeters to spare, the glass was successfully saved from shattering.  She looked up at her husband, and became  worried at the look on his face.  "I  don't care if he is the commanding general's son, I'm going to rip his balls  off and shove them down his throat," he growled.  "I'll scalp that little prick and use it to polish the cannon  barrels on my fighter."  Marx was seeing  red—blood red, more specifically, Virgil Leonard's blood.</p><p>The phone rang, pulling them back  from the abyss.  Ranma answered it,  automatically using Japanese.  "Moshi,  moshi; Marx-ke."</p><p>There was a pregnant pause on the  other side, followed some background noise, then a familiar voice  answering.  "<i>Hi Ranma.  Sorry to bother you or your husband, but my  father needs to speak with your husband.</i>"</p><p>"Oh, okay Angelica…" Ranma looked  at her husband.  "Chris?  Christopher-kun?"</p><p>That pulled him back to  reality.  "What is it?"</p><p>"The father of one of my classmates  needs to speak with you."</p>
