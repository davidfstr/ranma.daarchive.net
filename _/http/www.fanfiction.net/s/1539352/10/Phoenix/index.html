</div><p>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer</p><p>The Marxs stood in the Misawa train  station waiting for the express to Minato-ku.   Even though she wouldn't admit it, Ranma was a bit of a nervous  wreck.  Her last meeting with her mother  didn't go over very well; in fact it had her kicked out of the Saotome  clan.  Marx stood next to her, his arm  around her shoulder for support.  He had  managed to wrangle a few days of leave before deploying, and was going to use  this time to, hopefully, get to know his mother-in-law.</p><p>A travel-worn individual wearing a  rather large backpack with an umbrella strapped to the top walked by the  couple.  "When I find you Ranma, I'll  make you pay for running out on our man-to-man fight.  I've seen Hell because of you," he muttered.</p><p>Marx looked at his wife, shock,  surprise, and recognition evident on her face.   "Is there something I should know," he asked, as the bandana-clad  individual walked further on, and was asking for directions to Tokyo.</p><p>The redheaded martial artist  relaxed as her old junior-high school foe wandered off in a completely opposite  direction from the one he was given.  "I  think I recognized him.  Pops had me  wandering for so long, I never really made any friends, except for Ucchan.  But when we'd stop for any extended amount  of time, Pops would enroll me in the local school, so that I wouldn't get in  trouble with the local truancy officers.</p><p>"One time, Oyaji enrolled me in an  all-boys school, since that was the only school in town.  Fights would break out at lunchtime over the  last edible bread served in the cafeteria.   My first day, I used this one kid's head as a spring board to snatch the  last curry bread of the day…(No, I'm not doing the full flashback.  I recommend Vol. 1 of the manga if you want  to read it.)…So I waited for three days at the appointed challenge spot, which  was only a couple of hundred meters from his house; but he never showed up, and  Pops knocked me out to drag me of to who knew where, although I think it was  Bangkok next."</p><p>Marx sat there, and incredulous  look on his face.  "There's no way  someone's sense of direction can be that bad."</p><p>Ranma smiled.  "His was.   I had to lead him to and from school every day.  Supposedly, he could get lost in a room with  one door.  I don't know what happened to  him after Pops dragged me away."</p><p>Marx hugged his young wife.  "You know I'd let nothing happen to  you.  I'd die to protect you."</p><p>"I know you would, and for that I'm  eternally grateful that I found you…" Ranma was about to continue, but was  interrupted when the train to Minato was announced.  "Chris, do you still want to go through with this?  Trying to patch things up with my mother?"</p><p>Marx sighed.  "I'd like to, but if you don't want to, I'll  understand."</p><p>Ranma kissed her husband gently on  the cheek.  "I want to get this over  with.  I just hope Mom will be a little  more understanding, especially now," she said, rubbing her swollen belly.  As they stood, the couple walked arm in arm  to the train, ignoring the looks of the locals.  Their unborn child decided that he didn't like being ignored, and  to show his displeasure kicked his mother…hard.</p><p>Wincing in pain, Ranma looked at  her belly.  "Behave, little one.  Otherwise Mommy will take you on a ten year  training trip and put <i>you</i> through all the same things your grandfather  did to your mother."</p><p>As they took their seats on the  shinkansen, Marx looked at his wife.   "You wouldn't, would you?"</p><p>Ranma gave her husband a sheepish grin.  "Of course not.  But it's the threat that worked.   The baby calmed down."</p><p>With an almost imperceptible  motion, other than the slight building of g-forces, the bullet train began to  pull away from the station and accelerate to its cruising speed of 200mph.  The redheaded martial artist looked at her  husband's white knuckled grip on the chair.   "Anything wrong, Chris?"</p><p>"N-no.  Its just that I feel like we're flying."</p><p>Ranma chuckled.  "Technically, we are."  She smiled at her husband, and took his hand.  "I forgot you're a pilot, and you don't  trust another pilot's flying skills.   Don't worry.  We're on rails, not  wings."</p><p>Marx just nodded, deciding to grin  and bear it.</p><p>The train pulled into Minato  station on time.  Amid the rush of  passengers and commuters, the Marxs found themselves whisked along in the flood  of humanity.  "How are we going to find  your mother," Marx asked.</p><p>Ranma flinched slightly.  "She looks like an older version of…well,  me."</p><p>The crowds parted, and standing  there, waiting for them was Ranma's mother.   Although her hair was more auburn than fiery red, she was a spitting  image of her daughter.  "Marx-san," she  said, questioningly.  It was kind of  hard for Nodoka to miss the husband of her son-turned-daughter, since he was  wearing his Class-B uniform and leather flight jacket.</p><p>Marx bowed formally, almost as low  as one would for royalty, at his mother-in-law.  "Hai, Saotome-san."</p><p>Ranma in turn bowed at her  mother.  "Okasan."</p><p>Her mother returned both bows, and  turned her attention back to the American Air Force officer.  "You made the request for this meeting.  And I granted it."</p><p>"Okasan," Ranma said, "Before we  begin, can we find someplace where we can at least sit?"  Nodoka offered her apologies, and the three  moved into the lounge.  At that hour,  bar was empty, allowing the mother and soon-to-be mother a chance to talk in  private.</p><p>Marx sat his wife down, then sat  next to her, taking her hand in his.   "You've been there for me, now it's my turn," he said quietly.  Ranma squeezed her husband's hand before  beginning.</p><p>"Okasan, I know that our family has  always been honorable; that sofu Sakai was raised to be and fought in the air  as a samurai.  Our family would choose  death before dishonor under the code of <i>bushido</i>.  But I ask you this, is what my father did  during my training any more honorable than me wanting to stay alive; to  experience life to it's fullest?"</p><p>"The last time we met, Ranma, you  never described your training that underwent with your father."</p><p>Ranma sighed.  "Where should I begin?  I might as well begin with the  Neko-Ken."  Once again, Ranma began her  tale of woe.  As she described the  Neko-ken, Nodoka began to feel queasy.   Descriptions of other training techniques that Genma put his former son  through had the Saotome matriarch pale at the physical and mental torture Ranma  went through.  Broken friendships, the  hardships of the road for ten long years, the idea of theft as training that  Ranma went through darkened her mother's features.</p><p>The trials after Jusenkyo, and the  friendships that Ranma made amongst the Joketsuzoku realized that there was  still much honor and an inner strength in her daughter.  Ranma described to her mother how she felt  when she was disowned, the journey of self-discovery through Japan, and how  many times she came close to being raped.   Tears came to Ranma's eyes as she told Nodoka of how her resolve was  worn thin, of how close the redheaded martial artist was to becoming another  member of the homeless killed by the elements, until her rescue by her  husband.</p><p>Marx tagged teamed his  mother-in-law at this point, allowing Ranma to take a sip of water, and to rest  her voice.  The Air Force officer told  Nodoka of how he found Ranma, then nursed her back to health.  The fact that he fell in love with this  cursed woman the moment he saw her, how that love deepened regardless of her  past gender.  Marx explained the  difficulties of getting new sets of identity papers, because she was clanless,  after the marriage and the favor that was called to by someone in the  prefecture government.</p><p>The couple spoke in turns of the  trials that Ranma faced in the school with perverts, the friends she made, the  difficulties of being a fighter pilot's wife.   They mentioned the fact that Ranma was training her husband in the  family Art, and how that first training session resulted in her pregnancy.  Her abduction by Genma and subsequent rescue  by special operations teams made the head of the clan think about her husband's  actions and two-faced ideas of honor.</p><p>Nodoka, the stoic matriarch that  wanted her daughter to cleanse the honor of the Saotome name with her death,  was so moved that she reached across the table and grasped her daughter's  hands.  "R-Ranma, I never knew how far  your father would go to train you.  I  should never have let that…man take you away from me.  But at the same time I am glad that he did, and although I can't  say that his choice of a final training ground was appropriate, it allowed you  to meet someone who truly loves you.  I  just feared that Genma might do something else."  Nodoka sighed.  "He signed  a pledge to his friend and training partner Soun Tendo that the two schools of  Musabetsu Kakutou be joined in marriage."</p><p>Ranma snorted.  "I doubt it.  The last time I saw my…father," she said with a sneer, "he was handcuffed  and awaiting to be taken back to the mainland.   The police that helped rescue me told me on the flight off the ship that  Genma had so many warrants for his arrest that the countries that filed the  warrants will be trying to figure out which one gets him first."</p><p>Nodoka chuckled.  "Its just that I'm glad that you are  married.  I'd hate to see you married to  Soun's youngest daughter.  She has a bit  of a temper problem.  Of course, her  middle sister eggs her on, and that, in turn fuels her displeasure at most  people.  Perhaps the schools can be  united in a future generation.</p><p>"If your grandfather were alive  today, he'd be proud of you, daughter."   She smiled at her son-in-law.   "Particularly at catching a fighter pilot.</p><p>"You managed to come through the  ordeals that apparently your father called training with your honor  intact.  You have proven yourself a  worthy member of the Saotome clan, much more so than your father ever did.  I will have you restored to the family  register."  Nodoka smiled at her  daughter.  "I will be proud to have you  as my daughter.</p><p>"I do have a question.  If you were permanently cursed by falling  into a spring at Jusenkyo, what happens when your father get hits with cold  water?"</p><p>Ranma laughed.  "He turns into a panda.  So appropriate for that lazy old fool."</p><p>Her mother also laughed.  Nodoka was quite able to see her  incarcerated husband as a panda.  Her  expression turned serious when she looked at her daughter.  Ranma noted it, and grasped her husband's  hand tighter.  "Ranma, I have to  ask.  I know you can no longer be a 'man  amongst men', but will you be a 'woman amongst women'?"</p><p>Placing her free hand on her belly,  Ranma looked at her mother.  "Okasan, I  will not be a paragon of virtue or a 'woman amongst women' or any such outdated  notions.  It is the 21st  Century, and I am trying to be a modern woman.</p><p>"Yes, I was raised as a martial  artist.  Yes, I may decide to become a  physical education teacher, because of my love for the Art and a desire to pass  it on.  But I can be only the person I  am, and the best role model I can try to be for my children.  That is all that can be asked of me."</p><p>Nodoka nodded dejectedly.  "I understand, my daughter.  I had hopes…but I realize now that our  family is living in a past that is a historical study for secondary school  students.  I respect your determination  to be your own woman, as my own father did when I fell in love with  Genma."  She looked at Marx.  "Christopher-kun, treat my daughter well,  and love her as if she had been born a girl.   Respect her wishes and her skills.   Be mindful of her desires, but do not let her be demanding.  And most of all, please, call me 'Mother'."</p><p>Marx cleared his throat.  "Okasan, I will respect my wife, and love  her as I love life itself.  I fell in  love with her the moment I saw her, even before she told me about her curse.  And, yes we may have our disagreements, but  we understand that they will happen.  I  have already told Ranma that I would give my very life to protect hers.  My parents raised me in the tradition of  western chivalry, and I would never strike her, unless it was during a sparring  session."</p><p>Nodoka nodded at her son-in-law's  comments.  "Very good,  Christopher-kun.  I'm glad that you feel  so strongly for my daughter, and were raised to honor women."  She smiled at the amerikajin holding hands  with her daughter.  "Welcome to the  Saotome Clan."</p><p>"Thank you, Okasan."  Marx said, nodding his head to his  mother-in-law.</p>
