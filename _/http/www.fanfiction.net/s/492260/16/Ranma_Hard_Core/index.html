</div>Ranma; Hard Core<p>"Ranma," Nabiki approached, and reached out her rain soaked hand to clasp onto the red head's shoulder. As soon as contact was made, Ranma flinched, and turned on the older girl.<p>"What... what was that all about?" Ranma's voice sounded almost weary as she addressed Nabiki.<p>"Where are you going?" Nabiki attempted to change the subject, not comfortable with what she had said to her sister.<p>Ranma threw a quick glance back towards the house, allowing the feeling that she needed to get away almost completely overtake her. Once again, the pigtailed girl turned away from Nabiki, ready to run.<p>"I SAID, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" Nabiki's temper was still at high, and she didn't care for the way Ranma just gave her the cold shoulder.<p>The tiny threads holding Ranma's temper together snapped, and the redhead once again turned upon Nabiki with an extreme expression of emotion, "LEAVE ME ALONE!"<p>The middle Tendou sister took a step back, bringing her arms up slightly as if ready to defend herself. Almost instantly, she dropped her guard and got back in Ranma's face, "OR WHAT? YOU'RE GOING TO HIT ME, HUH? GO AHEAD! DO IT! I'VE BEEN AN EMOTIONAL PUNCHING BAG FOR MOST OF MY LIFE! WHAT DIFFERENCE IF SOMEONE ELSE PHYSICALLY BEATS ON ME, TOO?"<p>The Rain had begun to roar down, almost drowning out Nabiki's shout. Ranma still heard her clearly, "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT BEING AN EMOTIONAL PUNCHING BAG? YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO PUT UP WITH A DAMN FATHER THAT TELLS YOU YOU'RE A DISSAPPOINTMENT. SAYS YOUR SO DAMN WEAK BECAUSE YOU TURN INTO SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T BE? WHO SAYS YOU'RE WEAK BECAUSE YOU NEARLY KAMI-BE-DAMNED..."<p>Nabiki shoved Ranma, which shocked the redhead fiercely, "DON'T EVEN GIVE ME THAT HOLIER THAN THOU SHIT! SO YOU NEARLY DIED, QUIT THROWING IT IN EVERYBODIE'S FACE BY ACTING.. acting... Oh.. oh Kami... I'm... I'm..."<p>Even under the pounding and oppressive rain, Nabiki heard Ranma's whisper like a crystal ting in total silence, "No, you wouldn't understand, would you?"<p>Nabiki reached out, even though Ranma's retreating form was not much more than a blurry silouette in the wall of rain that hammered Nerima. The girl staggered back, as if she had been completely battered into submission, and slumped against the wall, realizing she was no better than Akane. Hypocricy seems to run in the family. What a great one for Ranma to be marrying into...<p>"Saotome, what had you done to your Son?" Soun asked. The gravity in his tone was enough to hyperdensify steel. Genma turned away from his best friend.<p>"Tendou, I... I was wrong for what I've done to Ranma. He..." Genma lashed out at a nearby wall in fustration, but was stopped by Soun before any property damage could ensue.<p>"He's even more scared than I have ever witness in anyone. His near death did more to him than you care to admit, didn't it, Saotome?"<p>"It broke him, and Kami help me, I completely shattered him after that." Genma pulled off his bandanna, revealing his bald head. He gripped it tightly in his right fist, as he turned to look into the rain, "He's my Son, and you don't know how much it scared me to see all of his blood spilled all over the ground. Shouting for someone to call an ambulance, being told by doctors of his status constantly like they had some morbid curiosity of my reactions. I was NOT about to let him go through that again, Tendou! I could not bare to go through that again."<p>"So... you pushed him, didn't you? You thought that if you made him hard enough, he wouldn't ever be hurt again?" Genma wouldn't answer. "Saotome, I know how difficult it is to raise a child, but I cannot fathom what you're going through. My... my wife left us, and I was admittadly devistated. I could not imagine the loss I would feel if I were so close to losing any of my daughters..."<p>"Pray to the Kami you never will, Tendou."<p>Kodachi was able to hear it all, what with the acoustics of the Tendou home being somewhat sound, while the paper walls didn't provide much in the way of auditory privacy. Pondering for a moment, Kodachi pulled out a cell phone, and hit speed dial number two...<p>"Sasuke. No, I am not ready to return. I have a request of you. Ranma Saotome, find out as much as you can. Between the ages of fourteen to sixteen. Search for both sexes. Yes, under the same name..."<p>Akane tripped, and stumbled into the soaked street. It was now almost to the point where you could not see your way beyond a few feet, with the rain blanketing the area. She didn't know where she was, as she had been running blindly from her sister, from Ranma, from herself, from everything. She thought she could help Ranma, but how could she when she couldn't even see past her own flaws.<p>No, she saw them clearly, she chose to ignore them while everyone watched them under a microscope. It hurt that even her sister believed the rumors going on about her at school. So what if she didn't like any of the guys that thought beating on women was a great way to get a date? In fact, she wanted so badly to punish them for thinking women were some commodity, so she never felt the obligation to hold back in her morning bouts. Everyone took it the wrong way, thinking she didn't want their advances, apparently more lusting after the fairer sex.<p>Akane was actually a very outgoing girl, she liked her friends, and made friends easily with those who would be her friend. Unfortunately, most guys didn't see it possible to just be a 'friend' with a girl, so all she would be around were other girls. It wasn't fair that she got the labels she did, because boys were jerks that wouldn't accept simple friendship. When Ranma came, she eventually saw an opportunity to clear things up about her, and Ranma really seemed like she needed a friend...<p>Akane sobbed harder when she noticed her mental image of Ranma; the red-headed girl she had met not too long ago, not the ink-black haired boy with the cute but fleeting smile that made her want to smile with it and hold it for the rest of the day. Why did she think of Ranma as a girl? Was she truly... that way? She knew Ranma's girl form was cute, in fact, she knew that several of the girls in her class were cute. Why would she notice something like that? It wasn't fair, she didn't want to be that way!<p>Not only that, Ranma now hated her. In Ranma's eyes, Akane was the little lesbian hypocrite that wanted only the redhead, not the guy she was falling in love with. Ranma would now have nothing to do with her. Nobody wanted anything to do with the little dyke; she was only humored, as Nabiki pointed out to her. Not in so many words, but Nabiki even had revealed she wasn't blind to her little sister's disgusting and unnatural faults. Everyone had to be the same way, her sister was supposed to love her unconditionally, not throw it back in her face. If Nabiki could stab her in the back like that, anyone could...<p>It wasn't fair.<p>It wasn't fair.<p>Tofu watched, as Kasumi got into the cab to head home. He now didn't know what to think about Ranma. He now knew the reason why the pigtailed martial artist was so scared. Scared nearly to death that an attempt on his life could come at any time, from anyone.<p>Someone so young didn't deserve such levels of paranoia. The doctor could not condone the actions Kasumi described Ranma committed to, though he knew that his once infatuation held an extreme bias against him, not that Tofu could blame her in the least. Tofu also suspected there was much more to this than Kasumi stated, of perhaps was blind to, herself.<p>With that in mind, Tofu resolved that he would get Ranma the help he so greatly needs.<p>Ryoga curled up his arm; at least he still had feeling in that. He looked down the bed he was laying in, disgusted with his weakness. With an infurious but low growl, Ryoga used his arms to sit himself up. He would NOT let Ranma have the satisfaction of him being completely out of commission. Ryoga made it his absolute goal in life to end Ranma's, and he would do so; as a paraplegic, or otherwise.<p>"Ranma, this isn't over between us. I promise you, you will suffer for this."<p>Ranma had no intention to stop running. Why did he come back to Nerima? Feh, he was being a fucking idiot, not to be at the shores of China right now. His father didn't care, since Ranma was so damn weak in the first place. He would be happy that his worthless *daughter* would be trying to make himself strong again.<p>He let those three damn girls get to him; act like they could be his friends, and then show they had nothing but contempt for him. Maybe Akane could understand him, but she was proving to be a girl with a constant temper tantrum, beating up on her sisters whenever she got angry. He didn't have any idea what they were shouting about, but Akane attacking someone who didn't have the sufficient skill to defend herself.<p>No, he was pretty sure Nabiki had to have said something bad to her, but he didn't know...<p>Ranma's thoughts were cut off, as a heavy wooden jo staff connected with her jaw, sending her flying backwards, and skidding on the rain slick walkway.<p>"Saotome, Saotome... you really should watch where you're going," An unfamiliar voice came from the figure in front of him holding an umbrella over his head, and a staff in the other. With a flick of the wrist, the staff was gone. "You just might run into a dead end..."
