</div>Ranma Hard Core<br/>The First Story, Part 5<p>Ranma sat with his arms crossed, staring with an expressionless face at the school vice principle. The man sat uncomfortably as he looked upon the boy before him.<p>"I understand your right to defend yourself against an attack..." The man cleared his throat before continuing, "...but, what you did to Kuno seemed a bit excessive." Ranma tilted his head in agreement, but in a way that held a great deal of indifference.<p>"He attacked me, he's responsible for what happened," Ranma responded cold and casually. The man across him was taken a back by the pigtailed boy's cavalier attitude, but kept his composure.<p>"Well, I see it is your first day here, I think it may be best if you wait until a further time to enroll, at least for the day or so."<p>Ranma shifted his eyes away in irritation, "Fine."<p>"Don't think of it as an expulsion or anything, I just think it would be best to wait until tempers have... cool down a bit," The vice principle already knew there would be retaliation against the new student from the Kendo club for his actions, it may be best to curb any further violence before hand.<p>"I understand," Ranma said plainly, though with his disgrievence written plainly across his face. The vice principal nodded and allowed Ranma on his way. After the door had closed, the man let out a relieved sigh; the boy was just too intense. The aura of remorselessness was completely palpable. Gathering himself, he decided to look further over the young man's records in preparation for their next meeting.<p>Ranma stepped outside, and immediately changed genders. Glancing up at the rain, Ranma pursed her lips, and walked towards the Tendou home.<p>Akane was regretting her decision. In a major moment of insanity, she had gone and blurted out her imposed relationship with the pigtailed boy. It had helped to allieve a few things, but she found herself dealing with a new slew of problems. The morning moron squad seemed more hesitant to approach her during school now, after witnessing the way Kuno was harshly dealt with. And she had found it funny that no one had enquired about her and Ranma's fianceeship, in fact, no inquiries reached her, although the whispers of her classmates did.<p>"If you ask me, Kuno got what he deserved."<p>"No way, he didn't need that, I think that pigtailed guy enjoyed it!"<p>"Yeah, he was smiling when he tried to break off Kuno's arm!"<p>"Well, Kuno DID hit him, he had a right to defend himself, and after what Kuno said about him, I don't blame him for it."<p>"Man, Kuno was our best hope for the Kendo championships!"<p>"Well, you're welcome to take it out on that new guy, wherever he is."<p>"I heard he was seen walking from the vice principles office and out the gates, he probably got expelled."<p>"Good, he's probably too dangerous to be here!"<p>"Now that's not fair!" Akane shouted the last part, and blushed when all eyes turned towards her.<p>"And what, Ms. Tendou, is so unfair about subject-verb agreement?" Akane's English teacher inquired.<p>"Um, I'm sorry sensei."<p>"I'm pretty sure you are," the man responded, "though to humor me, why don't you stand outside and hold a couple of buckets of water for me? Then I would believe you're sorry."<p>Akane grimaced, and then nodded before getting up and gathering two pails.<p>Nabiki was having similar problems with damage control for her group. Fortunately people came to her for info, in which she could turn a profit and set them straight. Unfortunately, she was finding her work a bit more difficult than usual.<p>"So, is your sister's fiancée crazy or something?"<p>"No, let's just say he's had a rough life, and the engagement to my sister has yet to be decided I may add."<p>"You're holding out on us, I bet he's some kind of serial killer and you're trying to hide the fact." Nabiki kept a straight face, despite the stupidity that the question was drenched with.<p>"I don't know of any criminal records he may have. My dad seems to know them pretty well and by name no less. I've heard his real name, and it doesn't ring any bells as Japan's most wanted."<p>"But, you're not sure, right?"<p>Nabiki glared at the boy, and then turned away, "I've told you what you've paid for, good day."<p>"Uh, I can pay more..."<p>"I *said*, good day," Nabiki's voice dropped the room temperature by at least five degrees. The dense student finally got the hint, and made his way to his desk. Nabiki sighed, and planted her chin into the palm of her hand. The pigtailed boy had indeed caused a stir by not only defeating Kuno, but also incapacitating him in extreme, not a good move. Kuno may have been a jerk, but he was a well popular and known jerk in Furinkan, it wouldn't take a genius to figure whose side most of the school would take. Nabiki wondered why she was even bothering to take the effort, but decided that it was because the boy had already had it hard enough from what she had been told; he didn't need any more grief. Yeah, that was the reason.<p>The student that had just been talking with Nabiki made his way to his desk, and leaned over to the girl next to him, "What's with her? She actually turned down milking me for more money."<p>The girl looked at him with slight shock, the turned back to Nabiki, "I guess you were asking her about the new boy? She's probably hiding something, I mean someone that violent probably is wanted or something."<p>"Well, she denies that. But I'm not convinced." The other girl nodded in return.<p>The young man in a white muscle shirt and black pants imagined himself hammering at an imaginary opponent. His attacks came hard and strong, each strike powerful and controlled to almost rigidness, as he processed through a free flow kata influenced by Chun Choy Dai Do but most essentials in Hao Jie Kwun with a Northern/mountain style stance and step. For building internal power, he utilized concepts from the Tiet Sien Kuan form, keeping muscles hard and tense while flexible and maneuverable. His concentration never left as his halberd was sent through it's forceful and assertive, while showing it's outside strength, proved to have a great deal of inner power.<p>He stepped forward strongly with his right foot and with his left hand holding the back at waist height as a hinge, he swung down his right hand that was holding the halberd at a almost a foot past the middle with a vertical strike that stopped tightly when the weapon was parallel with the ground. He twisted it's head so that it also flat with the ground, and then lifted his right foot and moved it diagonal back to the side slightly, while bringing back of the head to rake across his opponent's chest, and then brining the butt of the halberd for a strike to his imaginary opponent's ribs, raising the head of it against his shoulder so the shaft crossed his chest in guard against any potential strikes from the assumed placement of his 'sparring partner'. He then brought his left foot up and moved it to the front in a hip walk, while bringing his left hand under and his right hand over for another overhead horizontal strike with the blade that caused his right arm to overlay on his left arm. He then slid his right hand higher up the shaft of the weapon to near the head, and braced his thumb against the shaft to help control. His left hand rotated back to down to forward as a guard, while he swung the halberd fiercely in a horizontal arc.<p>He recalled a battle between his beloved and the Japanese girl. The woman he loved had been battling all day, and was weary. It was understandable when she suffered a loss of face in front of her people, and intended to regain her honor in the ways their laws declared. The Japanese girl suddenly became exceptionally brutal, even by his people's standards, when she was informed what his dear love had given her.<p>He turned back forward, the weapon suddenly missing, his right fist shooting forward at chest level as his right arm came up for a loose high guard that would allow him to redirect any high strike to his left, leaving his opponent open at their right temporarily. In one motion, he brought his left hand in an arc to the left of his face, and bent his wrist back while curling his fingers into a tiger palm while extending his elbow making the strike for the head; at the same time he pulled his back right foot up and stomped it down, making it the hold his center of balance so that he may bring his left leg up in crane stance, his right hand came up for a straight finger open palm guard against the forehead.<p>His mind flickered back to seeing his love lying on the healer's table, whimpering in agony after having her limbs reset. The healer said it would be an exceptional miracle if she were able to regain her full abilities from the damage done to her. He vowed to her that he would take up her quest for vengeance and not fail her.<p>Suddenly, his right hand swooped down at a wide arc, then forward at an upward diagonal angle with a flash of metal when he flicked his wrist; his left foot dropping down diagonal outwards and forwards, braced firmly and solid. His left hand had swung upwards and outwards, and as the right hand flew back to the right side at neck height, it came down to parry an imaginary blow from his opponent's right. His right foot came up for a strike to his opponent's chest under his opponent's still straightened arm. As if anticipating the stagger, he brought his right foot back down, and shot his left hand over the parried right arm, and dropped his left arm down to trap it. His left foot slid out to the side, as he leapt backwards, wind milling a flash of metal in his left hand, and followed up with a similar flash from his right.<p>He remembered when he discovered the secret the Japanese girl held; she, at that time turning into a he, had been to Jusenkyo. He decided that then he would challenge the Japanese boy and kill him, avenging his love. Apparently his prey didn't like the threat of death, as he had barely escaped being impaled with his own spear.<p>He folded his fans and flicked his wrists, almost seeming to will them to be gone. His opponent was incapacitated now; it was time for the kill.<p>He thought back to just previous that day, as the pigtailed boy fought the Japanese swordsman. The Japanese boy had been careless, and held back a great deal while dealing with his opponent then, maybe it was because he saw the kendoist as very little threat, he couldn't be sure. He knew though that it was best to wait until he saw his prey come to his fullest potential in a challenge before striking.<p>He raised his hands into the air and was suddenly holding twin butterfly swords. His left sword dropped first, swooping down and arcing at an angle across his opponent's trunk, followed closely by the right sword. He then brought the right sword across the waist area, which was tailed by the left sword.
