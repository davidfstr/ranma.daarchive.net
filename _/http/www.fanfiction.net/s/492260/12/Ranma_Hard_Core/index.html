</div>Ranma; Hard Core<p>"That has to be one of the sloppiest forms I have come across in the longest time, are supposed to be some kind of martial artist?" Ranma paused, and turned a harsh glare towards the man that had come up behind him without noticing.<p>Tofu took a step back with his hands raised in a placating gesture, "I'm only joking, really, you're quite good, I can tell. But it is obvious something's bothering you. My name is Dr. Ono Tofu, yours?"<p>Ranma grunted, and went back to the Tai Chi kata, attempting to calm himself down after his confrontation with both Soun and Kasumi Tendou. Unfortunately, he was finding very little relief in the motions, this time. Both of the mentioned, Ranma knew, hated him. Ranma wasn't sure what madness he was experiencing when he decided to return, he presumed it was to make sure that his worthless father wasn't still attempting to freeload from them. While he was there, he had seen no trace of Genma Saotome.<p>As sure that Soun had nothing but animosity towards Ranma, the young martial artist was very surprised not to find his possessions left at the doorstep. He then assumed that they were left at the front gate, but he was... dissappointed? Ranma wasn't too sure about that, himself. If anything, there was a twinge of... relief.<p>Ranma realized the doctor was waiting for a reply patiently, and probably would try to cheerfully pester him until he got an answer, "I'm Saotome."<p>"Saotome? Hmmm, any relation to the guests of the Tendous? I hear they are traveling martial artists, and you look a little road worn, yourself."<p>Ranma didn't reply, instead choosing to go back to beginning stance, and make a better attempt at his form. Tofu felt a slight pang of irritation at being blown off, but stuffed it down and decided to be more persistant, "You know? I was just heading back to my clinic from dropping off some medicine for one of my patients. I have some tea that works wonders on the nerves."<p>"No, thank you," Ranma replied, going through the motions, but not feeling himself committed to them. He was currently thinking about how Dr. Tofu could work wonders on his nerves by getting lost.<p>"It's obvious that you're not getting anywhere with your practice, and it's going to be like that until you get whatever it is off your mind. I'll be the unrelated third party to vent to, I'm told I'm a good listener."<p>Ranma closed his eyes, and grit his teeth; now wondering at the wisdom of deciding to head to the park until he calmed down, "I'm declining, alright? Thanks for the offer, but I've got other stuff to do!"<p>"Like make a mockery of the Quan style, " Tofu quipped. After a moment's pause, he fell into place with Ranma, going through the same motions but with a more fluid and 'personal' signature, not including to mention the slight variations that his sifu had taught him. In contrast, Ranma's motions were absolutely perfect technically, but it was like they were being done by a machine, that stopped mechanically and harshly as he continued into motions that were more remenicent of Chen style.<p>Ranma attempted to ignore the doctor, as they both finished 'repel like monkey'. Unfortunately for him, the doctor would not be dissuayed, "You know? It's such a beautiful morning, and my clinic is closed today. It's rather nice to practice out in the park, don't you think?"<p>Ranma turned an irritated glare towards the other man, as they both began 'wave hands like clouds', "I wouldn't know, I'm not quite enjoying it at the moment."<p>"Nothing's stopping you from leaving," Tofu said cheerfully, "Interesting, but you would feel less tension in your hands if you splayed your fingers slightly, instead of cupping them."<p>"I'm sure you're busy today," Ranma urged, while falling into 'single whip'.<p>"Not busy enough to help someone who's in obvious distress. I'm not a psychiatrist, just a family doctor and chiropractor, but I think I know a troubled soul when I see one."<p>"Fine, you want to know?" Ranma abruptly stopped, and turned to face the doctor, "Everyone's on my ass for crap they don't understand! It's like I'm some kind of devil or something because I'm willing to defend myself instead of getting... of getting... the crap beat out of me." Ranma finished the last park rather meekly, which didn't go unnoticed by Tofu.<p>"Hmm, I think I had the same conversation yesterday with your... sister?" Tofu continued on, when Ranma didn't give a solid reply, "The art is a serious thing to practice, though I'm sure you know that already. But it is too easy to..."<p>"Ranma? RANMA! There you are!" Both the boy in question and the doctor turned to find Akane running up to them. Almost second handedly, Akane noticed Dr. Tofu, and suddenly became coy, "Um... hello... doctor..."<p>"Hello there, Akane. I presume you've been taking care of yourself? You haven't had to come by my clinic recently."<p>"Ah... I've been very careful when practicing lately," Akane replied with a shy grin; doing the best she could not to look directly at the doctor. Ranma looked on curiously, before his eyebrow quirked in wry amusement.<p>"That's good, you must have progressed far in your studies. I bet you're father's proud of you."<p>"He-he is," Akane replied. Her eyes found Ranma, and she found an excuse to get out of this akward situation, while remembering why she was out in the first place, "Ranma, why did you just leave like that? I don't know what has gotten into sis, she's usually very sweet."<p>Ranma waived non-committadly, "Don't worry about it, she won't have to put up with me for long. I just came back to make sure I didn't forget anything."<p>Akane's face grew stern, "Oh no, you're not running away again! Even if I have to tie you up and bury you under the floorboards of the dojo!"<p>"Huh? Ran away?" Tofu repeated, eyeing Ranma with slight dissappointment, "And what is it Nabiki did to him, Akane?"<p>"It wasn't Nabiki it was..." Akane paused, and turned a worried glance towards Tofu. The doctor blinked, and gave a level gaze to Akane.<p>"Then it was...?" Tofu asked with an even voice. He knew Akane wasn't a liar, so whatever Ranma had done to set her off was something pretty spectactular, like his sister had done<p>"Um... Ranma, come back with me, everything's okay, really."<p>"Well, don't let me hold you two up," Tofu stated with his cheerful demeanor back in place, "I'm pretty sure I'll have the chance to talk with you again sometime, Ranma." Tofu gestured to Akane for the pigtailed boy to take his leave, while Ranma studied the girl with scruteny.<p>"Why are you being so nice to me?" Ranma asked cautiously, earning an eye roll from Tofu, and a confused pouting expression from Akane.<p>"Why shouldn't I... oh! I lost my own temper first, I... I don't think I can blame you for what you almost did." Ranma was silent, he had no illusions on what his reaction was in the bathroom not too long ago. This girl couldn't be serious...<p>"Your sister was pretty upset at me, and you're Dad's no better. So..."<p>"So what? You're still a guest at our house! You're not acting like a pervert like all the other boys usually are, and Nabiki seems to be okay with you. Besides, Daddy isn't going to throw you out, he's probably too spineless to do it," Akane said the last part with almost a growl.<p>"Akane, that isn't very nice..." Tofu chided, while puzzling over Soun being angry enough to throw out an obviously invited guest.<p>"I'm sorry, doctor, but the way he and Kas... the way Ranma's being treated by them is making me mad."<p>"Well, I don't know the circumstances behind all this, but I think you need to go back and at least clear things up," Tofu stated to Ranma, "Mr. Tendou is a rather forgiving man. A bit mecurial in his emotions, but a good man to be in the good graces of. And you seem like the type of guy that wouldn't intentionally do wrong."<p>"You don't know me, doc, so don't..."<p>"Ranma! He's just being nice!" Akane interrupted, almost getting into Ranma's face.<p>"It's alright Akane, he's just needing to blow off some steam. I'm pretty sure Ranma didn't mean anything by it."<p>"You're really too kind, Dr. Tofu," Akane stated with a sunny smile that even caught Ranma's attention.<p>"Well, how about you two go ahead and run along now? You can come by my clinic later and visit. I'll have my best tea ready for you, sound good?"<p>"Thanks, doctor!" Akane replied, taking Ranma's hand, and leading him back to the dojo. Dr. Tofu kept his smile, until they were out of sight. He didn't know what Ranma did, but for it enough to get on Kasumi's bad side, he was now determined to find out.<p>Soun answered the phone before anyone else had a chance to, "Tendou residen... Saotome! You're son has returned. Yes, I believe he's going to be staying. We'll await your return then. I see you upon your return, my friend." The Tendou Patriarch hung up the phone, and took a deep breath of satisfaction, before walking off. Around the corner, Nabiki watched her father, wondering exactly was going on with him. She knew how he was treating Ranma, but also noticed the endearment he directed towards the pigtailed martial artist when he thought nobody was looking.<p>"What's your game, Daddy?" Nabiki thought to herself, "You're still up to that rediculous plan to marry one of us off to him?" Nabiki vowed that she would do whatever she could to keep anything happening against anyone's wishes, especially Ranma's. He deserved some peace, she mused to herself, although she wouldn't mind...<p>Nabiki stopped that though quickly, and began to consider contengency plans in case her father decides to do something foolish. If anything, Nabiki would work as if she owed Ranma a debt of honor, not for some imagined intrests she was developing. Not in the least.
