</div>Ranma; Hard Core<br/>Book 1, Final<p>Ranma-chan attempted to focus upon her attacker, but the swimming sensation from the blow, coupled with the torrentious rain made her visual senses unreliable.<p>"I missed you at the Amazon village," the young man commented casually, as he stepped closer to the girl who was scrambling backwards in fear, "You know? The place where you brutally beat my dear Xian Pu to death?"<p>Ranma braced her right hand onto the ground, while balancing on the ball of her right foot, and then lashed out with a sweeping left foot at her opponent's legs. The Amazon boy scoffed, and lifted his right forward foot out of the way, while spinning to his left in an almost cavalier manner. The Redhead used that time to get to her feet, and rushed after her attacker.<p>Mousse switched the umbrella to his left hand, and feinted right, before leaning to his left, putting all his weight onto his left leg while keeping the right planted just by the toe. The top of his right hand slid against Ranma's right hard jab, and the Amazon boy twisted his hand so the palm turned outward, and pushed Ranma's arm off center, throwing the girl off balance.<p>Ranma was attempting to use the jab as a means to get in closer, but instead, found herself turned sideways and stumbling. Mousse's hand continued to guide Ranma's arm, swinging wide like a bird's wing readying to flap. While his weight was still on his left leg, Mousse pulled his right leg in, and then swung it around so the outside of his foot connected with the right side of Ranma's face.<p>The girl spun around, spitting blood out from a busted cheek, as her opponent brought his foot down straightened out to the side of his body while crouching low. His umbrella had vanished, as he slid his body so that he put the weight onto his right foot, while raising up tall with his left knee pulled to his chest. He held his left fist low over his abdomen , while his right fist was held up three inches above his head, making his arms form a yin/yang symbol.<p>The redhead brought up her boxer's guard with the right side forward, much more weary of her opponent. she shuffled forward, throwing two right jabs to test his defense. Mousse brought down his right hand with the palm open, while stepping forward to the side at a 45 degree angle. He parried Ranma's first jab, leaning back with his weight on his right leg, still, and then parried the second jab to the outside by bringing his left hand under and pushing it off course by the wrist. Ranma saw an opening to Mousse's right, and threw a left hook after closing the gap with the second feinted jab.<p>Mousse had purposely left it open, and knew Ranma would pull her right forearm back to protect the right side of her face from retaliation. His right hand slipped under his left wrist, and shot forward to grab Ranma's wrist as she was pulling back. He then ducked low under her arm, while turning his back to her. The redhead jolted, as Mousse rammed his left elbow backwards into her sternum, and then leaned in deep into her, while pulling almost gently on Ranma's right wrist with his right hand. The girl's momentum from doubling over was used against her, as Mousse shifted his shoulder upwards, lifting her into the air, flipping her over him, and slamming her into the ground.<p>Ranma-chan went limp before hitting the ground, distributing the force throughout her body. She quickly rolled to her feet, going into a Muay Thai stance with right side forward. Mousse had finished his throw in a low phoenix stance; his right side forward with the right leg extended towards Ranma and the right arm held low and just off to the side, while the left hand was held up high, and his left leg bent and almost tucked under his body, while the knee pointed from his body at a near ninty degree angle.<p>Ranma held defensive, waiting for what her opponent would do next. Mousse hopped up slightly, bringing his right leg in, and landed low, spinning backwards and lashing out with a left heel sweep. Ranma-chan pushed back on her right foot, and slid back out of range of the sweep on her left leg. She then thrust her right foot forward in a push kick aimed for Mousse's head.<p>As soon as Mousse finished spinning to his left, he spun back to his right from the kick. His left hand caught Ranma's heel , while the right hand caught the top of her foot. As he was turning away from the kick, he pulled Ranma forward off-balance once again. Mousse didn't complete the second turn, instead, brought his tightly bent left arm under Ranma's elbows, and lifted it up so she couldn't recover her guard quick enough, and then straightened his arm to a nintey degree angle, rotating it at the shoulder to backfist Ranma in the face. Mousse then dropped to his right knee while turning to face Ranma fully, driving his right fist into the front right side of her stomach.<p>Ranma's stomach tensed with the blow, but she didn't mind her right arm, as Mousse suddenly swung his right hand up, cutting it between his left and Ranma's right arm, and grabbed loosely onto the inside of her wrist while coming to standing again. He then brought up his left hand, and placed the palm against the tricep, just above Ranma's elbow. With a twist of the right hand, and a slight forcing down of his left, Ranma was forced to bend down, allowing an ample shot for Mousse's left knee into her stomach. Mousse then brought his knee down, and braced his left leg, while leaning towards his right. He pulled the redhead around him, and then let go of her arm. Before Ranma could get away, Mousse spun tightly back to his left, and dropped to his right knee again, while swinging his right arm out like a wing. He tensed at impact, making the blow much more potent, and forcing the redhead to double over the low lariat attack. Her legs kicked forward, not able to abate the forward momentum from the sudden stop, and Ranma dropped to her back.<p>Mousse raised up to stand on his straightened left leg, spinning to back to his left. As he came back towards the fallen girl, he was holding a baton in each hand, and rammed them down into Ranma's stomach, causing the girl to cry out, as her head shot up and her legs kicked up.<p>Mousse put away his batons, and turned away from Ranma, while tucking his hands into his sleeves, "You know? I'm rather dissappointed. You managed to nearly beat to death the champion warrior of our village with your bare hands. I expected a bit more resistance than this..." He casually pulled out a knife, and tossed it over his shoulder. It landed right by the side of Ranma's face, unnoticed by the girl through her pain, which meant it lacked the proper intimidation factor Mousse wanted to employ.<p>Ranma rolled over, clutching her stomach, while coughing up rainwater that had flooded her mouth during her scream. She opened her eyes, and noticed the red tinge from the water she had just coughed up. Her blood was quickly being washed away by the rain, but a slow leak was replenishing it. an internal rupture, not good, but nothing extreme, but the sight was enough to shatter her desperately constructed psychological wall and persona she had built up since her near death.<p>"NOOOOOOOOOO!" Ranma suddenly scurried backwards on her hands, and ran her back into a wall. She then pulled herself into a trembling fetal position, staring with open eyes at the spot where her blood had been, imagining an open gash in her chest that leaked her life fluid freely.<p>"Don't whine, it's not becoming of an Amazon's victim," Mousse stated nonchilantly, and then sighed, "Maybe I had too much in my expectations. I mean as much as I prepared for this moment, you had no idea it was coming. I watched how you fought, particularly against your friend with the bandanna whose back you nearly broke. I had trained quite rigorously to surpass what I've seen of your current fighting skill. Then I took the opportunity given to me while you were emotionally shaken to strike, not to mention not fully healed from your little tryst earlier. Tell me, did I put too much effort into this?" Ranma didn't answer, as she was still trembling, looking at the same spot on the concrete and rain drenched walkway.<p>"HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, HERE!" Mousse kicked the girl, sending her rolling onto her side. The rain callously washed away the fallen tears mingled with blood from where they had fallen, while Ranma curled back up into a tight, trembling ball.<p>"Please..."<p>Mousse went stiff. His ears compensated for the lack of his sight. And since Shampoo's near demise, he had gotten serious about rectifying his inhibited sight by concentrating a lot more on his hearing and sense of touch, so he was able to hear Ranma, "Wha-what?"<p>"Don't... don't kill me, please." Ranma's weak voice caused Mousse grew furious to the point he was trembling himself.<p>"YOU NEARLY KILL MY DEAR SHAMPOO, AND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO PLEAD FOR YOUR LIFE?" Mousse fiercely kicked the girl on the ground again, causing her body to lift up, and her to spit up more blood, while sobbing even louder. "DID SHAMPOO BEG YOU FOR HER LIFE AS YOU ATTEMPTED TO BREAK EVERY BONE IN HER BODY?" He kicked Ranma-chan in the back, gaining another reaction of pain from her. "NO, SHE DIDN'T, DID SHE? SHE WAS A WARRIOR, THE *BEST* OF OUR TRIBE. DO YOU KNOW THE DISHONOR OF HER FOR BEING DEFEATED AND CRIPPLED FOR LIFE BY A SNIVELING COWARD LIKE YOU?" Ranma was crying audibly, now, holding onto herself tighter than ever. "YOU DIDN'T EVEN DESERVE TO MEET HER! MUCH LESS FACE HER!"<p>Mousse's voice became a low, gutteral, near growl, "Your death brings about as much honor as dispelling garbage." With that, Mousse raised up on one leg into a crane stance, producing two butterfly swords; the one held in his left hand was sticking straight out forward by his waist, while the other one was held above his head, pointing towards Ranma's head down at an angle. Mousse dropped down, while stabbing towards the back of the girl's unprotected back.<p>The stab went into the concrete just to the side of Ranma, and a moment later, Mousse staggered forward onto his knees, and then fell onto his face. "Xian...Puuuuuu*" he exhaled, as his pupils began to relax. Blood started to leak from his mouth, from a wound caused by the knife in his back. The same knife he had tossed at Ranma's head.<p>"Nobody, exept me, will kill Ranma," Ryoga stated coldly, as he sat in a wheel chair, and still wearing his hospital gown. The sight of the dead Amazon galvanized Ranma back to action. The only thing on her mind was to get somewhere safe, where she had felt most protected in a long time. Mousse's dead eyes watched with Ryoga's cold gaze, as the redhead ran back towards the Tendou home.<p>In a non-stop dash, Ranma-chan made it back to sanctuary. The sight of Kasumi exiting the dojo with an umbrella over her head, and Ranma's pack in her hand, brought Ranma back to higher levels of coherance. The rain had let up a bit, so Ranma could see her cold and hardened face, a face that said plainly that he was no longer welcome there. Soun and Genma stepped out of the house, and saw Kasumi with Ranma's stuff. Soun immidiatly took off to his daughter, and began a heated argument with her, which Kasumi returned with just as much venom. Genma grimly walked to his son, and stood before him with a more imposing countenance than Ranma had ever known her father to use.<p>"You've been in another fight.." Ranma's father stated simply. Ranma held her arms over her stomach, while squinting out of her left good eye, but did not answer.<p>"I won't ask what became of your opponent," Genma continued, "but, this was the final straw. Me... and Tendou had been talking, and came to an agreement." Genma took a deep breath, "Until further notice, I am forbidding you from practicing the art, until we are both in agreement that you are... well." Genma bowed his head in remorse, also not wanting to see the expression of intense betrayal and despair on his daughter's face. Ranma's frantic face looked back from Genma to the arguing Tendous, then back to her father. She once again turned to the Tendous, and ran.<p>Soun saw Ranma heading for him and his daughter, and immidiately went on defensive. Ranma reached Kasumi, and wretched his bag from the other girl. Soun and Genma were shocked at Ranma's actions, and didn't react in time, before Ranma had a good head start on them. Kasumi stood with an expressionless face, as she watched the girl run away. The rain beat against her pale flesh, making it impossible to tell where the rain ended, and the tears started.<p>Ranma ran until her injuries caught up with her. She dropped to her knees, clutching her backpack, and crying as she or he had ever before. Nothing, she was no longer had anything. She was defeated totally, shattered more than a plunge of a butterfly knife deep into her flesh could. More than a fall into a cursed pool managed to. More than her father's constant brow-beating, a potential friend's betrayal, and a possible familie's hate and anger ever had.<p>As the rain became heavier again, a silouette of a girl came up behind him, equally drenched from the rain, as she had left her umbrella behind. She kneeled to the side of the smaller girl, and wrapped her arms around her. Together, they continued to cry, as the rains became so heavy they couldn't be seen.<p>The worst storm in Nerima's recent history.<p>Early morning found Kasumi, sitting at the table in the kitchen, reading a note with a dispassionate expression, while sipping on a mug of tea. Soun entered the kitchen, and his eldest daughter turned towards him.<p>"Ranma's gone for good, not intending to return again." Soun stiffened as Kasumi abridged the note to her father with no emotion, and then nodded in remorse. He turned to leave, only confirming what his best friend had told him already, as Genma had already taken leave.<p>"Nabiki wrote the note."<p>Soun didn't even bother to go up to his middle daughter's room to check if she was there.
