</div>Ranma Hard Core<p>"I must say, I am enjoying the peace and quiet," Kodachi commented with a smirk. She glanced towards her brooding older brother whose arm was still in a sling, "Tell me, will it always take a major injury to still your prattle?"<p>"Are you not due to mug another opponent before a match?" Tatewake snapped, having enough of his sister's jeers. In his anger, he even forgone his usual prose.<p>Kodachi narrowed her eyes menacingly, "I do not 'mug' people, I merely meet with them and initiate the contest outside the ring." Kodachi perked up a bit, "Besides, I had already met with next week's opponents."<p>I suspected as such," Kuno growled in distaste, and then turned back to his brooding.<p>"Oh, do cheer up, brother-dear, you're bringing the mood of the house down with you. I must admit, I am quite interested in finding this one who had managed to earn your extreme anymosity. He may prove interesting." Kuno gave no reply, instead choosing on continuing to brood.<p>Akane watched Ranma in the back yard holding his stance for fifteen minutes, contemplating what particular reason he was doing so. After a while, the raven-haired girl walked out into the yard, and copied the stance.<p>It was simple enough, her right foot pointing foward, with her left leg supporting all the weight, as the foot pointed out at a forty-five degree angle foward while about a foot length and a half behind the right foot, and a little less than a foot length to the side. She kept her back straight and her chin level, while her right hand was held out in front of her, almost straightening the arm, while the left arm was kept against her body about at the waist, with its hand placed slightly level with the other arm's bent elbow. She took the que to slow and steady her breathing, and began to hold the pose...<p>Twelve minutes later, Akane's left leg shook violently from the strain of holding still; ten minutes following, it buckled until she almost collapsed. Ranma paid her no mind, as he continued to hold his pose with focus and barely a hint of exertion.<p>"What's the point of this dumb exercise, anyway?" Akane griped, sitting down to give her leg a rest.<p>"Its one of the heavenly postures. It builds your connection with the earth, so that you can channel power from it. Its principle is to grow your 'roots'," Ranma stated, not moving from his pose.<p>"And how do you figure that?" Akane asked.<p>"Manage to hold it for an hour, and you will understand."<p>"It's been two weeks now, are you planning on going back to school anytime?" Akane enquired, changing the subject.<p>"I haven't been asked to return yet."<p>"Oh," Akane replied nervously, and then gained a bit of her bearing back, "Well, you shouldn't have to be asked, have you even contacted the school to go back?"<p>"I wasn't aware it was my duty to do so. Have Pop do it, he's my dad, after all."<p>"Do you always have to be so angry?" Akane snapped defensively, before blinking in slight shock, talk about the irony in the question *she* just asked.<p>"I'm not angry," Ranma replied curtly, still maintaining posture. Akane frowned, but decided not to pursue any further, and attempted the 'Heavenly Posture' once again.<p>After five minutes, she wasn't able to save herself from falling, as her leg gave out before her determination. Ranma didn't look back towards the long haired girl, but a slight smile danced across his face, before it went back into his usual hard and stoic expression.<p>Akane rubbed some feeling back into her leg, and looked up once again to Ranma, "You know? I'm probably the last person to say this, but I guess it isn't really all that good to be mad all the time. I mean, if you weren't, you'd be able to show off that nice smile of yours.<p>Ranma stumbled foward, and stared at Akane incredulously, "What?" The girl smirked, as her teasing managed to topple his hard attitude, and didn't answer as she limped back to the house with Ranma staring at her back.<p>Nabiki was leaning on the porch railing, seeming to look unconcerned out to the yard, "So what was that all about?"<p>Akane turned to Nabiki's seemingly disinterested question, "Mmm, just told him he has a nice smile, that's all." Akane continued into the house, and paused. She waited a few more seconds, before turning back to her sister, who was still staring out into the yard, while Ranma went into one of his katas.<p>"Huh? No smart remark about me falling for a boy?" Akane asked with a raised eyebrow.<p>"Wha? Sorry Sis, you said something?"<p>"Nevermind," Akane continued on her way.<p>"Good, good, it will not be long before you regain full motion of your leg again. Once that is met, we'll begin training you in earnest," the elder woman stated, as she watched her Great Granddaughter lift her leg foward as much as possible. Her hear was almost broken at watching the exerted tears that Shampoo wept, from the agony of the motion, the girl was left in a sad state indeed, after her last battle.<p>"Great Grandmother, please, I would like to rest now," Shampoo stated, though the pain was near intolerable, she would make a fast recovery. It was apparent to all that she needed at least a month more to recouperate, but she was determined to speed up the process, regardless of what potential permenant injury she would cause to herself. She outsider would pay *dearly* for humiliating her, and then almost crippling her, with her life and blood.<p>"I understand, but you do realize that I doubt you would be able to confront the one who did this to you for a long time to come?"<p>"I will have my revenge as soon as I can possibly take it. I will kill that red headed bitch for the humiliation."<p>"SHAMPOO," Cologne shouted, barely able to keep the emotion from her voice. The girl snapped to her elder with mild shock at the outburst. Cologne regained herself before continuing, "Shampoo, the girl is much more dangerous then you are taking her for. She had to be restrained after crippling you by that panda... of..."<p>"What is it, Great Grandmother?"<p>"I just considered something, perhaps I'll be talking with the guide of Jusenkyo soon. In the meantime, rest, so that we can continue your recovery."<p>A thin figure hid in the treetops outside the Tendou household, looking inside. She saw the harlot that had managed to win her brother's affections, Akane Tendou, and the mercenary witch that robbed him of his allowance like a running whore, Nabiki Tendou. Also she had seen what apparently was their servant girl, and the man of the house talking with a rather unsavory looking fellow with a balding head and dirt stained gi. She had yet to witness this young man that was apparently staying with the Tendous, that had managed to harm her brother.<p>She didn't particularly care for what happened to her brother, really, but Kuno family honor obliged her to make restitution for the crime of attacking one of her kin.<p>She looked into the windows on the second floor, trying to determine which one may be holding her target, until she came to a room with two futons, and a muscle tee laying precariously on the floor.<p>"Ah, so this is his abode, how droll," Kodachi commented distastefully, as she looked around the sparse room. Apparently the Tendou's guests didn't believe in worldly goods, which meant to her that they had not a yen to their name. The though played upon her face, as her expression grew even more disgusted; how dare her brother be decisively defeated by a pauper. She would deal with the plebean, and then 'discuss' matters with her brother."<p>"You're not supposed to be in here."<p>Kodachi was shaken from her reverie, at the feminine voice, and turned to face its owner, "And who are you to tell I, Kodachi Kuno, where her place is?"<p>The redhead's eyes narrowed, as she dropped the towel she was using to dry her hair. Kodachi raised an eyebrow at the girl's wet torso.<p>"Heh, do you not believe in wearing a bra, you strumpet? Am I to presume you also spread your legs for any that would accept your homeliness?" Kodachi involintarily took a step back, as she saw the short girl seething with restrained rage.<p>"You have three seconds to leave," Ranma-chan replied in a cold voice, that had shown exactly how much she thought of Kuno.<p>"It is to laugh!" Kodachi stated hautily, "That you, tell the Black Rose of St. Hebereke, what she is to do!" Kodachi brought her gynmastics pins to bear and went into her rythmic gynmastics stance, "First, I shall deal with you, and then I shall gain my brother's revenge for the unjustly attack that was made on him."<p>Ranma didn't reply, as she went into her own stance, just before Kodachi launched at her.<p>The gynmast shot her left pin foward, ready to follow it up with her right. Instead, Ranma feinted to her left, and then to the right and back, ouside of the jab. Once positioned with her her weight on her right leg, Ranma grabbed Kodachi by the inside of her wrist, and slightly tugged her into continuing foward.<p>The Gynmast gasped, as she was forced to keep her momentum forward, and brought her left leg in front of her to steady her balance.<p>Ranma lifted her left leg, and shot her heel down at Kodachi's knee, right at the top, just outside of the front...<p>Everyone in the house looked up at the loud and agonized scream that had come from upstairs, and assumed the worst of Ranma. Not one in the household didn't rush upstairs to make sure their guest/daughter was alright. and found something they weren't quite expecting.<p>Kodachi continued to wail, as her left leg was bent at an akward angle, while Ranma-chan stood dispassionatly over her.<p>"Kami..." Akane breathed, and rushed to the fallen girl's side, "Ranma! What happened to her?"<p>The pigtailed girl just shrugged indifferently, as she turned away to get herself a dry shirt.<p>"Daddy, Dad! I need you're help with this!" Akane shouted, both Soun and Genma were knealing down before the girl.<p>"Okay, this is going to hurt, so take this," Genma advised, offering the girl a couple of pills. The gynmast was in too much pain to argue, and quickly dry gulped them. Once that was done, Genma nodded to Soun.<p>The Tendou Patriarch, breathed slowly, and went into action. His hands moved quickly, as there was a sickening crack, and the girl's leg was straightened again. Kodachi screamed louder than before, and started moaning and wailing in agony. Akane was cradling the girl to her, and telling her it was okay.<p>Kasumi stared, pale-faced, at the scene, before turning a furious expression towards Ranma, "Ranma! That was totally uncalled for!" At the eldest Tendou daughter's condemning, almost everyone else turned to glare at the pigtailed girl. Akane and Nabiki hadn't, as the former was still rocking Kodachi to sleep as the drug kicked in, and Nabiki had turned away to hide her expression.<p>"Ranma, your exessive way of dealing with your opponents is out of hand," Soun stated with a slight chill in his voice.<p>The pigtailed girl turned to the rest of the room, with her own expression of fury, "WHY ARE YOU BLAMING ME? *SHE* ATTACKED ME!" The girl puncutated by punching through a nearby wall in her anger.<p>"Boy, we're going to have to work on your control," Genma stated with his serious tone, probably more serious than he had ever been in a while.<p>Ranma was about to retort, but closed her mouth and glared back at the rest in the room. Now even Akane was looking back with an angered expression. "Fine, fuck this." Ranma-chan walked past everyone, and out into the yard to practice; she would be doing her tai-chi katas for a good deal of the time before it was time to sleep. She didn't even bother to come in for dinner.<p>Nabiki had watched Ranma for a good portion of the time. She wasn't exactly an exellent judge of form, but she could tell that Ranma's motions were extremely forced, and that her mind wasn't completely on the task.
