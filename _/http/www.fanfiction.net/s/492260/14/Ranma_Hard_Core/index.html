</div>Ranma; Hard Core<p>"Missed," a calm and callous voice stated simply from the settling dust. Ranma gave a shocked whisper under his breath, and wasted no time rolling to his feet, and dashing into the dust storm. Both Akane and Nabiki gasped, as Ranma slammed whoever attacked them to the ground, pinning the unknown assailant under him at the waist. Once in position, Ranma began to mercilessly wail on the face of his attacker.<p>Akane hadn't missed the expression on Ranma's face, when he heard the voice. It was shocked, and more than a little shaken. Whoever it was managed to do something she never thought could happen to Ranma, startle him. She also noticed the red umbrella laying a ways off to the side, that apparently had been knocked from their assailant's grasp when Ranma bum rushed him.<p>Nabiki also saw the expression, and then turned to the impact crater that now resided where Ranma *had* been standing when he pushed the two sisters out of the way. The attack was silent, meaning it was meant to connect, and the indenture in the concrete walkway had told Nabiki that it was meant to be more than an incapacitating blow, "Who... he's..." Nabiki's blood went cold at the realization; whoever it was, was trying to *kill* Ranma.<p>As Ranma's fist rained down, the bandanna clad boy under him kept his forearms gaurding his face. The boy on the bottom then quickly rolled onto his right side as hard as he could, while bringing his left knee up under Ranma, causing the pigtailed boy to lose his balance.<p>"URK!" Ranma choked, as his opponent's right fist connected with his throat. The unknown boy then took advantage of Ranma's distraction to sit up, and wrap his left arm around Ranma's neck. He then pulled Ranma down to his right, intending to slam Ranma's face into the concrete ground, only to have Ranma manage to arrest the decent by getting his hands under in him time.<p>Ranma then thrust his left elbow into his opponent's clavical, just before the neck, and then rammed it again against the other boy's head. Once the boy wearing the bandanna was staggered, Ranma turned onto his left, brought both hands onto the back of his opponent's head right above the base of the neck, and torqued down as hard as he could.<p>Ranma rolled out from under the other boy, and got to his feet quickly. The bandanna clad boy ignored the blood splatter on the walkway from where his forehead had grazed it, and looked up just in time to see Ranma attempting to stomp on his head.<p>The boy on the ground caught Ranma's foot, and shifted it closer to Ranma's left braced leg, causing the pigtailed boy to lose balance. The attacker then quickly got to his own feet, while still holding onto Ranma's right foot; bringing the pigtailed boy's right leg at a ninety degree angle with the rest of his body while he was facing up.<p>The boy then attempted to drive down his own right knee into the inner side of Ranma's knee, while twisting the foot outward in order to effectively dislocate Ranma's leg, or at least keep him from being able to use it. Ranma quickly twisted to his right and caught the dropping knee in the back of his own, while bringing up his left leg to drive his knee into the back outside of the other boy's thigh.<p>Ranma once again rolled from the other boy, and rose up with a punting kick with his right foot. The other boy quickly brought up his forearms, not even bothering to block the kick, and shifted forward to ram Ranma in the gut, sending the pigtailed boy backwards onto his backside on the ground.<p>Everyone finally got a good look at the newcomer who was staring at Ranma with hard, cold eyes that screamed total loathing for the other boy on the ground. Akane shivered at the young man, realizing what Ranma had said before tackling the other boy; 'Ryoga'. This Ryoga was even more intense feeling than she had ever known Ranma, as it seemed to him that the only thing that existed in the world was his pigtailed target.<p>Nabiki noticed Ranma's expression, which was more than just startled, it was now nearly panicked, and the way Ranma kept throwing himself after the Ryoga guy told her that Ranma wanted him gone in the worst way.<p>Not a word was traded, as both fighters rejoined the fight. Ryoga turned his left side forward, and slid his left foot on the concrete with the outside facing Ranma, before it became braced. He then spun to his right, bringing his right foot up with the large toe bent upwards as opposed to the other toes pointed downward, and the edge of the foot aimed at Ranma's head. Ranma ducked under the cresent kick, and slid his left foot forward, while punching his left fist forward towards Ryoga's gut for a rapid gut punch.<p>Ryoga quickly brought his right foot down by Ranma's left side, causing him to step deeper into the punch than Ranma wanted it to connect at, while tightening his stomach to absorb the shock. Once Ranma's attack was jammed, and he was effectively too close to retaliate from his position, Ryoga slammed Ranma fist away with a vertical fanning right forearm, and headbutted Ranma in the nose.<p>Ranma staggered back, fighting the tears building in his eyes, unable to avoid Ryoga's hard right cross to the chest. As Ryoga retracted the punch, he brought his left leg from behind him forward for a snap kick, which launched the doubled over Ranma back away.<p>Nabiki recognized the horse stance from it being the one Ranma was in yesterday, exept Ryoga held it firmly and ready with his left side forward, instead of Ranma's tenseness to build strength.<p>"Ranma," Ryoga stated, waiting for his opponent to get up, "I vowed that I would kill you for what you did to me, and nothing will stay my hand. You're only alive still because I wanted you to know that before I break your neck."<p>A low keening noise was emmitted from Ranma, as he got up with his head bowed. Even Ryoga had to take a step back from the unveiled fury in his opponent's eyes. Ranma's wail turned into a battlescream, as he charged at Ryoga with renewed vigor.<p>Everyone present stared in shock; this wasn't like their usual school fights. There was something totally ugly about it, and far more brutal than even the 'gentlemenly' brawl that Akane used to participate in every morning. The snarl on Ranma's face was beyond feral; Ranma was beyond angry. Ryoga on the other hand, had a particular cold fury, as if a part of him that would have made him return Ranma's blazing hot anger had died somehow.<p>Ryoga calmly waited, until Ranma threw a right haymaker at Ryoga's head. Ryoga brought up his left hand, and deftly patted the fist to the right side of his head, and was about to retaliate. Instead of letting him take the advantage, Ranma collapsed his punch into a blade elbow and torqued his body to his left while dropping his weight down for more power. The Thai elbow swiped across Ryoga's nose, breaking it, and also caused Ryoga to look away from Ranma.<p>The pigtailed martial artist was not slow to take advantage of this, as he slammed his right foot's heel into Ryoga's shin, causing him to buckle. Ranma then grasped onto the back of Ryoga's head with both hands at the base of the neck; right hand held under left hand. Once his hands were secure, Ranma pulled Ryoga into a kick boxing clutch, and deftly launched his right knee up into Ryoga's gut, while twisting his left leg out to open up his hip and give him more power to the blow.<p>Ryoga grimaced, as he felt a rib break, and attempted to pull back. Unfortunatly for him, Ranma jerked his opponent down to the left, keeping him in the clutch, and into a left knee that caught Ryoga on the side of his ribs.<p>"AH!" Ryoga felt his ribs bruise there, but not break, at least until Ranma slammed another left knee into the same spot. Ryoga brought up his hands to break Ranma's hold, but Ranma jerked him to the right, and into a right knee.<p>Desperate, Ryoga slid his right foot back, and delivered a double 'U' punch to Ranma's groin and stomach. Ranma stumbled, and relenquished the clutch, but shouted out in primal defiance, as he nailed Ryoga with a haymaker right to the temple. Stunned, Ryoga dropped to his left knee, allowing Ranma to backfist him, HARD, across the other temple with his right.<p>Akane and Nabiki's chests fluttered, as they watched Ranma deliver the final knockout blow to Ryoga, before they noticed something...<p>Ranma wasn't stopping.<p>Before Ryoga could hit the ground, Ranma quickly reached down, and pulled Ryoga back upright with his left hand by the boy's shirt. Ranma then proceeded to nail Ryoga in the face with several fierce elbows, as Ryoga weakly fought in vain. Getting fustrated that his opponent was not totally finished by his standards, Ranma used both hands to pull Ryoga to standing, and then rushed him into a wall ten feet behind them.<p>Ryoga's head collided with the wall, making a sickening thud as hit bounced, and dribbled a couple of times against it. With the wall against Ryoga's back, he was unable to do anything, as Ranma slammed another knee into Ryoga's gut, agitating already broken and bruised ribs. Without remorse, the enraged pigtailed fighter again slammed the back of Ryoga's head into the wall, leaving a thick splotch of blood against it.<p>Ranma was in tears at this point, and was shouting incoherantly, as he pulled Ryoga back, and slammed him against the wall again. Before he could do it again, Akane locked onto Ranma from behind in a full nelson, but didn't have time to firm the hold, as Ranma turned and backfisted her.<p>Nabiki was shouting for Ranma to stop, in tears herself, as the remaining students looked on in horror at the brutality being displayed. Several teachers finally dug up the courage to rush after Ranma and attempt to subdue him before the other boy was murdered. Unfortunately, they didn't arrive before Ranma pulled Ryoga from the wall a final time with both hands, stepped to Ryoga's right side, and bent the bandanna clad boy over his right arm.<p>With seemingly very little strain, Ranma lifted Ryoga into the air, and dropped to kneeling with his left right knee up, as his right arm forced Ryoga's body horizontal in the air...<p>_<p>And to the naysayers of the last few chapters; In some circles, they would be noted as 'Setting Ranma up for the Fall' ;p
