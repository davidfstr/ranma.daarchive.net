</div>Ranma; Hard Core<p>Akane walked through the gates of Furinkan, once again unmolested. Ever since the battle between Ranma and Kuno, every boy that had saught after Akane didn't dare bring the attentions of the 'crazy guy' that got suspended indefinitely from school. As much as Akane was enjoying not having to fight through a sea of irritating boys, she was rather disheartened for their reasons.<p>They all were afraid, ever moreso than they were of Akane herself or Nabiki's attention. On his first day, and last, Ranma had made an impression that was assuradly lasting on the student body. Fortunately, from Akane's standpoint, no one had asked what her relationship was with Ranma since. With all that out of the way, there was only one lasting nuisance in the young girl's life...<p>"My fierce Tigress, I would speak with you!" Akane didn't even bother to look in Kuno's direction, choosing instead to keep heading for the school doors. "Akane Tendou, though it pains you to look upon my statuesque personage, and witness my ailment suffered by the hands of an honorless cur that would use trickery and brutality in just battle, you will cease your trek and listen."<p>Akane turned a look; a look that was not a glare, but something far beyond irritation or dislike. It was obviously not the love Kuno delusionally imagined in her eyes, quite the opposite, really. It was not hate or loathing that was thrown in Kuno's direction...<p>It was total indifference.<p>Kuno had effectively been put out of commission for fighting for a while being, and though it wrenched his heart that the Beautious Akane Tendou would be robbed of the honor of sparring with him, he vowed that she would not have to suffer so severe. And while he constantly persisted in 'granting' Akane with his presence, the youngest Tendou found that without having to worry about fighting the idiot every morning, he could be easily ignored. This was the first day she attempted such, mainly because earlier events had set her in the proper mood to do so.<p>Even Kuno's obliviousness could not protect him from the look his beloved gave him, as he grew furious and beet red in his anger. He rushed to cut Akane off, before shouting, "YOU WILL ACKNOWLEGE ME, WOMAN!"<p>Akane took a step back, and looked at Kuno as if seeing him for the first time, seeing him *truly* for the first  the disgust could creep onto her face, she harshly shoved him aside, walked around Kuno, and into the school. Everyone that had witnessed the scene found themselves curiously in shock. Akane almost wasn't even acknowleging his presence anymore with a cold indifference that definitely set her as a relation to Nabiki Tendou.<p>Kuno stood for several moments, fuming at his treatment by his eternal love. He knew it had to be the work of that honorless cur, Ranma Saotome. Somehow he had managed to make the dear Akane Tendou betray her true feelings towards him; such an atrocious act only compounded the vengence Kuno would visit upon the evil barbarian.<p>"RANMA SAOTOME!" Kuno shouted with a tone that would make the bile in it boil from his loathing, "YOU COWARD, HEAR THIS! I WILL ENSURE YOU ARE MET WITH THE PROPER PUNISHMENT YOU DESERVE! THE SCION OF THE HOUSE OF KUNO WILL REMOVE THY BLACKENED HEART FROM YOUR BREAST, AND DO AWAY WITH YOU FOR..."<p>He hadn't even noticed that Nabiki had approached him, until the sound smack across his face cut off his 'ritious' pledge. Nabiki's look wasn't her usual cold one that her sister was currently wearing, it was disgust barely holding back the utter malice behind it.<p>Nabiki turned on her heel, and started to walk away, "By the way, Kuno," she said almost mechanically, as if trying to keep control of herself, "Your sister is staying with us. I'll send the bill to you after we've established the length of her stay." With that, she went into the school.<p>"What was that all about?" One student asked.<p>"Well, they are sisters, maybe it's just that time of the month."<p>Ranma stood, overlooking the slightly turbulant sea. It hadn't taken him long at all to make it to the ocean, and was currently trying to decide if he was going to swim across, or find a crew to join that would carry him across. While one would provide the proper exercise for training, the other would earn him hopefully enough funds to at least feed himself while making the trek back to Jusenkyo.<p>It didn't take him long to come to a decision, and just a bit more time to find a possible ship to ferry him that was currently looking for hands. Ranma approached the man standing by the sign, presuming him to be the captain, "You head'n to China?"<p>"Yeah kid, we are," the man replied dismissively, while attempting to wave over a man who ignored him.<p>"I want to join your crew then."<p>The man stopped, and looked at Ranma, "How old are you, kid?"<p>"Sixteen, but probably much stronger than any of the men you are currently hiring."<p>The man looked over Ranma. The young man definitely looked fit and firm, probably containing quite a bit of dense muscle, "No."<p>The pigtailed martial artist blinked, "Why?"<p>"We aren't gonna take responsibility for kids on this trip. It's going to be a rough ride, and I don't have time to be worring about minors on my crew. Where your parents anyway?"<p>"What does it matter to you? And why would you have to worry about me? I can handle my own."<p>"I take responsibility for anyone who becomes part of my crew," the captain replied in a slightly less harsh tone, "You may be fine and dandy, but I'm not going to take the risks with harboring a young runaway." The captain sighed at the angered look in the young man, "Look, kid, it's just about the responsibility that comes with it. If anything whatsoever were to happen to you, I would have to deal with it, sorry."<p>"Fine," Ranma turned, and decided that he could use a bit of exercise. As soon as he was a good ways down the pier, he adjusted his pack, and dove into the ocean.<p>"Hey, Akane."<p>The girl in question looked up from the book she was reading during study period, "What do you want?"<p>"Well," Hiroshi started, gathering the courage to ask the question every boy wanted the answer to, "That guy, Ranma, what happened to him? Is he coming back, or...?"<p>Akane turned back to her book, "He decided that he had better places to be."<p>"Really?" another young man listening to the conversation enquired. If Akane had payed attention to him, she would had recognized him as one of the boys from the mob that always attacked her in the mornings.<p>Akane didn't reply, choosing instead to focus on her text book.<p>"Nabiki... Nabiki Tendou..."<p>Nabiki kept herself forward, trying to pay attention and ignore her idiotic classmate. He had been attempting to get her attention all day, and she would not give him even an acknowleging glance. A note ended up on her desk, and she didn't even open it, already knowing who it came from. She instead crumpled it, and tossed it back in the face of the student it originated from.<p>Kuno was doing remarkably well in holding his temper down, suspecting that a combination of the femenine ailments many spoke of during the earlier hours, and the poison the devil Satome had injected into her and her sister's hearts were to blame for Nabiki and Akane's current temperments. But nonetheless, he would have his answers as to the whereabouts of the evil cur before the final bell sounded.<p>"Nabiki Tendou, I have urgent need of your information, I would pay you handsomely if it is to my satisfaction."<p>Nabiki shot out of her seat to standing, drawing the teacher's attention to her, "Problem, Ms. Tendou?"<p>"Kuno has been harassing me all day, teacher!" Nabiki stated, her voice holding just a slight hint of trembling.<p>"Yes, I have noticed that," the teacher replied with slight annoyance. He would have done something much sooner, but feared retaliation of some sort, after the last teacher that had sent Kuno out of his class, and ended up with a good deal of dirt upturned to the eyes of the school board. He was not sure if that was Kuno or Nabiki's doing, though.<p>"Either he goes, or I do."<p>"Well, I..."<p>"Then I'll be leaving class early today." The teacher, Kuno, and the rest of the students of the class watched dumbvounded, as Nabiki gathered her stuff, and walked out of the room.<p>Akane didn't even announce herself as she entered her home.<p>"Oh, hello Akane," Kasumi greeted, as she walked out to see who had come inside.<p>"Hi Kasumi. I'm kind frazzled right now, mind if you call me for dinner? I think I'll be in the dojo until then." Kasumi blinked, knowing it was Akane's routine to usually at least watch TV for a bit to unwind, before going to work out. It was usually only broken when she was truly upset with something; not angry, upset. The older girl nodded slowly, and returned to the kitchen.<p>Nabiki came down stairs, just in time to meet her sister about to ascend them, "Nabiki, how dod you get home sooner than me? Usually you're out doing something."<p>"I didn't feel like hanging around longer than I needed," Nabiki replied curtly. She let her sister pass, and then turned around, "Akane..."<p>"Hmm?" the younger girl replied, distracted.<p>"How do you feel, about Ranma?"<p>Akane didn't turn around, but Nabiki noted her sister's back become tense. "What should I feel about him?" Akane continued upstairs, into her room, and closed the door... gently.<p>That night after everyone retired, Kodachi turned and tossed in her provided bed. She was inwardly cursing at the low comfort her 'generous' hosts supplied to her. She would have complained, but the girl, Kasumi she believed her name was, had tended to her without complaint herself; something even her own staff at home rarely did. Because of this, she was not going to awaken them for her own needs. She was raised with at least proper manners.<p>"I would due with more refreshment, I cannot tolerate the parchness for too much longer," she said to herself out loud. a pair of legs passed by her vision, and gathered the glass that was on her nightstand, before walking out the room.
