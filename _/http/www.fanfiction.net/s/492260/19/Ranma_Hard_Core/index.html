</div>Ranma; Hard Core<br/>Book 2<br/>Prologue<p>Soun watched the rain fall outside his porch with a sorrowful expression. It was a heavy rain, one that drenched everything utterly, and could bring ruination in its downfall. As heavy as it was, it didn't even pretend to rival that one over a year ago. So much had happened in a single day of unrelenting rainfall that left no corner of his or his children's life untouched.<p>Akane no longer practiced the art since that day. She no longer socialized with her former friends, or even spoke much unless directly coerced. She spent most of her time in her room now, only coming out when nessessary. Her eyes were almost always downcast, and the times they may have met someone's, she would look away, as if unsure of something, or herself. Her grades had fallen, too, bordering between average and sub, just barely keeping afloat in school. She no longer wore the clothes she used to love, instead choosing more conservative wear that hid her young blooming and attractive figure. She constantly seemed ashamed of herself, whenever something wasn't done correctly, or something wasn't right, she seemed to take it worse than she should, sans the reason he stopped berating her for her school grades. Unfortunately, Kasumi did not either seem to realize this, or more likely didn't care.<p>Kasumi had grown imbittered since that day over a year ago. She had started to go to a new doctor, instead of the family one, and when Soun had enquired to Tofu on it, his face became stern, and he would state that that was a matter Soun would need to discuss with his daughter. Kasumi no longer took the same simple joy she did working around the house. Far too often had Soun overheard a sharp barb from her over the residents of the house as she tended to it. Her cooking had lost a great deal of it's appeal; it wasn't as if it became bad or so, it was as if she no longer cared to take the satisfaction out of the art she so used to love. It was like eating a meal from a cafeteria or airline; technically well done, but leaving a lot to be desired. And as far as her standards had fallen, Kasumi seemed quick to call Akane on her inadequacies.<p>Soun hadn't seen a trace of Nabiki since that day. He hoped she was okay, but at least knew she was okay, as she had apparently set herself up to work via correspondance to finish her school. The information of where her latest assignments were mailed to and from were directed to Genma, who had kept in touch with Soun in order to find his son and Soun's wayward daughter, but unfortunately, it seemed Nabiki and Ranma were much better at hiding and running away than even the elder Saotome was.<p>Not for the first time, Soun sighed, as he watched the small flood build in sections of his yard, draining to parts unknown, and whispered to hismelf, "Ranma, what have you done to my family?"<p>Ryoga sat in his bed, not quite wasting away, but only existing. Crippled, the doctors had said. For an indefinite amount of time, they couldn't be sure with the amount of spinal bruising and strain there was put on his back. At first, he was determined to prove them wrong, and worked hard in order to bring himself up onto his feet steadily. But even after a year...<p>He still couldn't feel his legs.<p>He blamed Ranma for it, as he had a billion times before, but it had no heat in it. Not because he had lost his hate against his nemesis, oh no, it was stronger than ever now, in fact. It was that Ranma wasn't there, and he couldn't do anything about it.<p>"Honey... Ryoga, someone is here to see you..." Ryoga snapped out of his dark contemplations at his mother's voice. He had forbid his parents seeking retribution against Ranma or the Saotomes, but knew it was hard on them. Soun Tendou had insisted on assisting with medical expenses, and Ryoga had to idly wonder where the man gained his finances from.<p>"I'm not in the mood, Mom, you know that," He never wanted to see guests while he was at home, as they would only come to either gawk at the paraplegic, or not have anything productive to do with or for him, or both. He would rather waste his time stewing in his own misery, than allow some false attempt at cheering himself up to make themselves feel better.<p>"I'm afraid I must be insistant," a lovely young woman, dressed in a slightly conservative, but well fitting business suit had stepped into his room. First thing Ryoga noticed was, despite the well done make-up she wore, was that she was not Japanese. She was from the mainland, most likely China somewhere. Her shiny black hair was apparently a dye job, with slightly lighter toned roots showing at the scalp that his trained eye noted.<p>The young woman raised an eyebrow at Ryoga's silent appraisal, and spun for him once, "Like what you see?"<p>Ryoga's brow lowered into an even deeper scowl, "What do you want?" His guest pulled out the chair at his desk, the one his parents hadn't had the heart to remove, since it felt like they would be giving up on their son.<p>Once she was situated, she crossed her legs, being careful not to reveal anything under her skirt that came to her knees, she spoke, "I'm on a... as you can say... 'warrior's pilgramage', not that that has anything to do with you. I am more concerned about your information on an associate of yours."<p>Ryoga relaxed a bit at the woman's business-like attitude, "And who would that be?"<p>"I believe his name is..." she seemed to ponder it for a moment, "Saotome, Ranma Saotome, that's what his name was, I'm sure."<p>Ryoga's head turned away from his unwanted guest, "What about him?"<p>The woman's face became a sinister smile, "I remember when I was like you, not too long ago actually. I know he put you in this bed, in a wheelchair. How far has your rehabilitation come?" Ryoga let out a low growl, as the woman seemed to smile even deeper. "Ranma deserves so much worse, don't you think? He not only needs to be physically broken, but totally, mind... along with soul."<p>Ryoga would have barked a laugh, but didn't feel the obligation to let this strange woman know the irony of her statement, "There's nothing we need to discuss, you can go now."<p>The woman's face turned from feral humor, to dead seriousness. She leaned over, close enough to whisper into his ear, "Listen, and listen well. I personally had to pull myself out of Hell, tooth and claw, because of what Ranma did to me. I have lost face, I haven't heard from a good friend in over a year, and I suspect Ranma had something to do with that. Ranma humiliated me in front of my people, and left me as some sort of broken doll that would have my kin turn their backs on me as if I were some weak outsider that was beneith their notice..."<p>The woman leaned even closer, and nudged his ear ever so lightly with her bottom lip. She spoke again in a quiet, quiet voice, "I will destroy Ranma, with, or without, your help. Not just kill, destroy."<p>Ryoga turned his arctic glare towards the woman, "Ranma is mine, don't you DARE harm him before I had settled things with him."<p>The woman leaned back, her smile back on her face. She reached out, and patted Ryoga on the leg as she stood up, "I hope you feel better, soon." With that, Xian Pu left the room. Ryoga was impressed; he had only known the young woman for a few moments, and hated her almost as much as Ranma.<p>Kodachi arrived home from school, and immidiately went to check on her 'pet project'. She smiled to herself, as the money had been delivered. Her resources were much better than the Tendou's, so she was able to keep tabs on Ranma and Nabiki with little problem. They were currently in the east, no doubt working those odd jobs Ranma insisted they do to earn money. Kodachi had to sigh, wondering why Nabiki hadn't told him about the money she keeps 'mysteriously' coming by on her person.<p>Kodachi had instructed that her agents were *REAL* careful about waiting for Nabiki to be alone, before sneaking the money onto her. For the most part, Nabiki didn't know how she was coming across the money, but started picking up on things, as she started taking more 'constitutionals' while Ranma was otherwise preoccupied.<p>Kodachi didn't feel any personal obligation to Ranma, at least not one for what had happened a little more than a year ago. She had gone back into his spotted history, digging up as much as she could on him.<p>There was a great deal of spaces she couldn't fill. She had his school records, as he did manage to attend somewhat regularly, which impressed her. Ranma's worthless father (in which she found a string of police reports on) had apparently insisted that he learn even when away from classes, so Ranma had a somewhat spotty correspondance with several schools. She had an interview done with a Saotome Nodoka, under the guise of a social worker's visit, and determined Ranma should never meet the woman, lest his curse put his life in jeapordy. She felt an obligation to keep him safe, as she was sure he was the victim of the same crime her own mother suffered from.<p>Kodachi mused how much she looked like her brother, even though they had different fathers.<p>Nabiki looked out the window of the train. She had finally bowed to Ranma's demands, and left him. She fought hard, but he was insistant. He cared for her deeply, Nabiki could see that, and that care was the reason she's being sent away from him. She left him with a great deal of the money she had been recieving mysteriously, though she suspected it may be from her father, or an associate. In a few hours, she would be arriving at her destination...<p>Home.
