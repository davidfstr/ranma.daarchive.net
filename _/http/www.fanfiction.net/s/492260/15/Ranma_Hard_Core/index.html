</div>Ranma; Hard Core<p>Kodachi stared at the redhead standing in her room, looking out the window into the rain. The bed ridden gymnast was too afraid to speak, from the way Ranma just 'felt' to her. It was a feeling she held akin to a desperate and trapped animal, trying not to show exactly how desperate it was, lest its enemies take advantage of it.<p>The girl had come home two hours ago, barely before morning classes would have begun. As curious as she was, Kodachi held her tongue, and allowed the girl her contemplation.<p>Tofu walked out of the hospital room with a weary expression. He had rushed as fast as possible to the school that morning, after recieving a call about a young man with severe back trauma, possibly a broken spine.<p>"Dr. How..." Akane asked with a nervous tone. She stopped, noticing how much her voice was shaking. Nabiki was still crying next to her, and their father and sister were on their way. Akane had managed to explain the situation to her father, and the thick silence from the other end told her exactly how furious he was, as he hung up without response.<p>"It's... it's not broken, but there is severe trauma to the spine. He..." Tofu steeled himself, "How did this happen?"<p>"Where's Ranma?" Nabiki asked with a weak tone though her sniffles.<p>"I don't know, he ran off, Nabiki," Akane answered, with a certain emotion in her voice that Dr. Tofu had slight difficulty trying to decipher.<p>The doctor did manage to catch the clue, however, "What does Ranma have to do with this? Is he the one who hurt this boy?"<p>Before Akane could answer, however, "WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS RANMA!"<p>"I don't... I don't know, Daddy!" the youngest Tendou daughter replied, almost coming to tears, herself, "He ju-just ran when we... we..." Kasumi quickly moved to her sisters to comfort them.<p>Soun's eyes narrowed, "I... think I know where he may be. Here's some money to take a taxi home in a couple of hours. Stay here until then."<p>The three girls nodded, as their father turned, and left to search for the martial artist. Genma should be arriving soon, he is going to have a great deal of explaining to do to his son.<p>"Don't worry, Ranma will be gone soon," Kasumi cooed, trying to calm her sisters. Both of them looked up, and backed away from her with incredulous looks.<p>"Kasumi, you, you don't understand. I mean, when that Hibiki guy attacked him, he was... I c-can't explain-n it." The way Akane's voice shook only served to enrage Kasumi further, though the only expression she gave was her mouth straightening from a frown to a thin straight line.<p>Tofu had managed to keep his composure around Kasumi due to the gravity of the situation, "Akane, can you tell me what happened?"<p>"H-he was attacked, and Ranma was winning, and Ranma, he..."<p>"Hold on, calm down, and start again. You said this Hibiki fellow attacked Ranma, for what reason?" Tofu enquired.<p>"Ranma's at home..." Nabiki whispered in realization, "Daddy knows Ranma's at home!" Quickly, Nabiki snatched the money from Kasumi before she could react, and rushed for the exit.<p>"NABIKI! WAIT!" Akane shouted, running after her sister. Kasumi stared with unbridled anger at the way her sisters rushed for Ranma, as if he were more than a common violent thug in their midst.<p>"Kasumi, would you please tell me what's going on?" Tofu asked with an exasperated voice.<p>Kasumi turned sharply towards Tofu, causing the man to step back, "You want to know what's going on? Ranma. Since he's come here, he's been nothing but a petty, uncaring, irresponsible brat with no control of himself, and is way too dangerous to be practicing martial arts! He's hurt my family, he didn't care that he may have ended Kodachi Kuno's gymnastics career. He *tried* to kill Akane! He tried to KILL MY SISTER! And now I find out that he tried to break someone's back?"<p>"Kasumi, just calm down," Tofu urged, finding a furious Kasumi rather... unsettling.<p>Kasumi's rage would not be abated, "I don't want him near Akane, I don't want him near Nabiki... I DON'T WANT HIM IN MY DAMN HOUSE!"<p>"This doesn't sound like Ranma. Sure she seems a bit withdrawn, and I can only imagine what had happened to her in the past... what do you know about her before she came to visit your family?"<p>"Does it matter? He's dangerous! I Wish he HAD died! At least he wouldn't be such a damn burden to those around him!"<p>"Ranma almost died? When was this? Kasumi, please, just settle down, I'm pretty sure she has a..."<p>"TOFU, FOR ONCE STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING FOOL, AND LISTEN TO ME!" Kasumi screamed, nearly in the doctor's face. Tofu stepped back, a final time, before his own features hardened. He calmly pulled his glasses off of his face, and polished them, before putting them back on.<p>He took a deep breath to calm himself down before he said something rash himself, and spoke before the seething young woman, "I don't know what's going on, because no one will tell me. I'm imagining your hatred towards him is founded, if she indeed tried to kill Akane. I can't say that I firmly believe that, since Akane seems to be fine with her, though I don't have much to go on. If you'll excuse me for not jumping to your conclusions until I've seen the evidence for myself. And keep in mind, young lady, I am your family doctor, you *will* treat me with the respect my position deserves. You will curb your language, and you will not longer shout, as we are in a hospital. is that clear?"<p>Kasumi gawked at the hard glare Tofu was giving her, unable to speak, until he asked her again, with a much clearer, sharper voice, "I said, is that *clear*?" Kasumi quickly nodded in reply, somewhat shaken and scared from the attitude she had never seen from the doctor she had admittingly always had a small crush on.<p>"Good," Tofu stated firmly, and then pointed to the lounge chairs in the hallway, "Have a seat, while I go prepare us some tea. It will help calm our nerves as we discuss this like *rational* adults, does that sound alright? Or do you wish to throw another tempertantrum? Because I do not want to have to waste my breath more than I have now." Kasumi meekly nodded in affirmative, and sat down quietly.<p>"RANMA!" Tendou roared, as he entered the house. He had already searched to dojo, and was now rushing up to the guest room. "Kuno-san, I'm sorry to intrude, but is Ranma..."<p>"She is here," Kodachi's voice spoke up from the other side of the door, though it was hesitant. Immidiately concerned, Soun opened the door, and was internally relieved not to find Ranma threatening Kodachi in any fashion. The redhead was currently sitting in lotus position, with her back against the wall with her eyes closed. Slowly, she opened them, and stared emotionlessly at her host.<p>Soun witheld his full ire, as he stalked towards the seemingly calm redhead, "What's this I find about you trying to break someone's back?"<p>"He got what he deserved for attacking me. He..."<p>"HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT!" Soun shouted, causing Kodachi to jolt, and Ranma to tense, "From what Akane told me, you had him THOROUGHLY BEATEN! In fact, she told me you lost CONTROL during the fight? I know my friend and your father Genma may not be the most valiant man, but I REFUSE to believe he raised his son to be such a coward!"<p>Ranma quickly shot to standing with a hard glare, while Kodachi was looking back and forth between the two; her mind cycling between being concerned over the argument, and wondering why the Tendou Patriarch referred to the girl as 'son'.<p>"WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THE BLAME ON ME? IT'S MY RIGHT TO DEFEND MYSELF!" Ranma shouted back in her own angry tone.<p>"DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO PASS THIS OFF AS SELF DEFENSE!" Soun forcably calmed himself, before continuing, "I heard about what you did to that girl in China. Genma seemed to think, or at least wanted to believe, that it was warrented. I ignored the attack on my own daughter, presuming that you probably were going to pull the punch, possibly to scare her. Kami knows she needs to be taken down a few pegs. I heard about your fight with this girl's brother, Akane and Nabiki said that he deserved it, though with their developing infatuation for you, I'm a bit reserved on their perspective. THEN what you did to this girl. I could have said that it was in self-defense, but I know, as well as you, the Anything Goes School has MANY ways of taking an opponent down without severe harm, and most of them are MUCH easier than attempting to break. Off. Someone's. Leg."<p>"I don't have to stay here for this," Ranma replied quietly, but found her path blocked by Soun, as she tried to leave.<p>"I HAD hoped that when you had returned a few days ago, that you had at least started to learn your lesson. I am greatly disheartened to find that you have not even grasped a clue."<p>"I DON'T need a lecture from you!" Ranma growled back, "It's either get them, or let them get ME! I'm NOT about to let them have the opportunity AGAIN!"<p>"THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU VERSUS THEM! YOU RAN OUT AFTER YOUR FIGHT WITH THAT OTHER BOY. ANSWER ME, DID YOU OR DID YOU *NOT* TRY TO BREAK HIS BACK?"<p>"YES. I. DID! HE WAS THE ONE THAT ATTACKED ME! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS! I WILL NOT LET ANYONE ATTACK ME FROM BEHIND WITH A SNEAK ATTACK AND GET AWAY WITH IT!<p>"I KNOW YOUR FATHER TAUGHT YOU RESPONCIBILITY IN YOUR ACTIONS! EVEN IF I COULD SANCTION WHAT YOU DID, YOU RAN AWAY LIKE SOME COWARD, INSTEAD OF FACING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS!"<p>"It was one of the first lessons I taught Ranma," Genma's grim voice came from the doorway, "As much as I tried to enforce it in him, admittingly not always by example, he somewhere along the line forgot it."<p>Ranma had definitely heard enough, from both Soun and her hypocrite of a father. She attempted to shove Soun aside, unheeding of her folly. The martial arts master grasped onto Ranma's arm as she did so, causing the infuriated redhead to strike for Soun's ungaurded throat.<p>She had apparently forgotten that Soun was a master of the school she practiced, and found herself disorientated, before her back met with the floor, and her chest pinned under Soun's knee. The girl thrashed furiously, but found her arms pinned, and her legs offering no leverage. Her predicerment only made her thrash about even more wildly and frantically. Then her screams of outrage came, then the tears. It suddenly dawned upon Soun, and Genma, the reasons for Ranma's actions, the way she acted.<p>Kodachi had never seen anyone act so scared in her life, "Was... was she raped?"<p>"Let her go, Tendou," Genma commanded.<p>Soun looked up at his friend, "But.. Saotome..."<p>"Let.. her go," Genma stated again with authority in his voice, "...please?"<p>Begrudgingly, Soun let off the girl, and moved aside, as she dashed past her father, and then down the stairs.<p>"Saotome, we have things to discuss," Soun stated with his own authority, and a slight hint of betrayal.<p>Much of the taxi ride home was quiet, excluding Akane's shuddering breaths, and Nabiki's subdued weeping. Something like this, they had never encountered before in their young lives. An out of control martial artist, actually attempting to do permenant harm to someone, and nearly succeeding.<p>"Kasumi was right," Akane said with a quiet voice. Nabiki's head snapped up at that.<p>"What? How can you say that? Kasumi HATES Ranma! She doesn't know him!"<p>"Like we do?" Akane asked with her voice still low, "He hasn't even opened up to us, I don't think he even cares... even cares about m-us... us, or what we think about him."<p>"What do you mean? He hasn't been here long, and with the 'trust' Kasumi and Daddy have been giving him, I'm not surprised the reason why!"<p>"That's not the point, Nabiki, and you know it," Akane leaned back into her seat, but found the motion moot, as they arrived at the front of the Tendou home. Nabiki and Akane both opened up their umbrellas, and stepped out of opposite doors of the cab, once Nabiki payed for both of them.<p>"Then what is your point, Akane?" Nabiki asked with an acidic tone.<p>"He... well..." Akane firmed herself, "You saw what he did to that boy, Hibiki. Ranma went far beyond what was nessessary. And his face, deities, I hadn't ever seen anyone look so angry before." Akane shuddered slightly at the memory, as she looked away from Nabiki.<p>The middle Tendou daughter gave a sharp bark of a laugh, "HA! Maybe you should try looking in the mirror sometime, when you're in your full 'all boys are perverts' mode!"<p>Akane dropped her umbrella, startled, and allowing the rain to soak into her school outfit and long, black hair. She hadn't forgotten her own plight, but having Nabiki remind her of it hurt more than even her own self contemplation and conclused truths had. Instead of giving ground, Akane defected to Kasumi's viewpoint, "It's... it's not the same! I don't..."<p>"You don't *what*? Put the boys in your fan club in the hospital? I got seven of your admirers that may say differently!"<p>"That's not fair..."<p>"SCREW being fair!" Nabiki shouted, not hearing the shouting match going on in their home, as she and Akane were too engrossed in their own heated argument, "Nobodie's been fair to Ranma since he's been here! Even YOU were blaming him for what he did to Kodachi, and we *BOTH* know that her being there was not good for ANY of us!"<p>Akane walked over, and slapped Nabiki's umbrella away, "He *BROKE* her leg, Nabiki, that's a lot worse than what he needed to do, if it were me..."<p>"IF IT WERE YOU, SHE'D PROBABLY BE DEAD RIGHT NOW! YOU ACT LIKE YOU CARE ABOUT RANMA, BUT LISTENING TO YOU NOW TAKE KODACHI'S SIDE JUST LETS ME REALIZE HOW MUCH OF A MAN HATING BITCH YOU ARE! YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE AROUND RANMA!"<p>"DON'T YOU DARE SAY I DON'T CARE ABOUT RANMA! I WANT TO HELP HIM BUT HE WON'T LET ME!" Akane got directly in Nabiki's face, "Fuck. Off. You're one to talk about being a bitch. I haven't seen you do much for Ranma, at least I'm TRYING to help him, while you give him a token prep talk. Yeah, shows how much you care."<p>"Ever thought that he won't let you help him because he doesn't *need* your kind of help? You'd probably want him to stay a girl and lick your bush like the man hating dyke you are..."<p>Nabiki's back bounced against the wall, but she managed to catch herself before she completely collapse to the ground. She looked up in time to catch Akane's expression of total rage, and a fist aimed for her face.<p>She also saw a dainty hand reach from the side, and catch it before it could connect.<p>Ranma-chan fiercely shoved Akane back, causing her to stumble, and fall to the ground. Ranma put herself protectively between Nabiki and Akane, in case the latter attempted more. Akane looked at Ranma with equal parts hurt and betrayal, which cut right into Ranma more than the redhead would let on.<p>"I guess we know which one of us he likes more," Nabiki responded snidely. Ranma turned a hard gaze towards Nabiki, but the middle Tendou sister schooled her face to be emotionless.<p>"What the Hell's going on here?" Ranma demanded. Akane's hot tears mixed with the cold rain, as she got up, and ran down the street, away from the intense heartache she was feeling. From the doorway, both Genma and Soun had watched the incident with stoic expressions.
