</div>Ranma: Hard Core<p>"Doesn't seem to be any maladies," Dr. Tofu mused, as he checked the fustrated girl's leg, "You did a good job setting her leg correctly. I don't think there are any pinched nerves, though her knee will start swelling. I'll have to check it from time to time to make sure it doesn't develop any infection."<p>"Of course doctor," Soun replied graciously, "Once again, we are in your debt.<p>"This was wholly unnessesary," Kodachi snapped, arbeit with a strained voice, "My family physician is quite capable of making this diagnosis."<p>Soun turned to the girl, and made a deep bow, "Forgive us, but I was not positive that we should move you. You are welcome to remain here in our care for as long as it is nessesary. As one of our... guests attacked you in a more than unnessesary manner, I feel it is our responcibility."<p>"Indeed it is, though I do not wish to remain here any longer than nessesary if that... witch is still around."<p>"Of course, we shall contact your home, and inform them of the situation, and arrange for your return."<p>"That..." Kodachi paused, and considered what would happen when she got home. Her brother wouldn't let her hear the end of it, after the consistant berating she had given him, "..would not be nessesary. Although I would require more comfortable arrangements."<p>Soun rose, and took a slight breath, "Understood, we have a spare bed we can move into the guest room that you may find suitable."<p>"Well, if there isn't any further need for me, I best be returning to the clinic," Tofu stated, gathering his supplies, and heading downstairs. At the base of the stairs, he spotted the redheaded girl that caused all the commotion. She wasn't trying to be conspicuous about it, but she was doing her best not to look at anyone, as she leaned up against the wall with her arms folded.<p>The doctor passed by her, and turned, when he notice her quick glance to him. With a curt nod, he went on his way to the front door. There was something about the girl, something in that intense bearing that brought him pause. He would have to question her later.<p>Not too much sooner, the Tendou Patriarch made his way down the stairs, looking a little haggard, "That young lady is certainly demanding, though I cannot blame her in this predicerment."<p>"Why not? She was where she shouldn't have been," Ranma internally winced, as she did the one thing she was trying to avoid, drawing attention to herself. Both Akane and Nabiki glanced in the pigtailed girl's direction, each pair of eyes holding a mix of emotions.<p>She didn't turn around to meet Soun's hard stare, though she knew it was there, "Young man, though she may have required subduing, the extent of the injury you gave her was exeptional. I think it would be a fitting punishment, if you were to care for her while she is here."<p>Ranma snapped to at that, "What?"<p>"I am sure you understood me," Soun replied with a tone that brooked no argument, "Now, perhaps you should go check up on her, and find what she currently needs, so that we may make her stay more comfortable."<p>Ranma was about to speak, and then turned to the other two girls in the room with her. Nabiki was giving the slightest shakes of her head in negative, while Akane's eyes dropped from meeting the redhead's. Finding he wasn't getting any support, Ranma's mood darked possibly even moreso, as she almost stomped up the stairs.<p>"Are you sure that's wise, Daddy?" Nabiki asked.<p>"Probably not, but it is for the best that Ranma learns the consequences of his actions. He is a martial artist, and one of our prime principles is a practice of restraint."<p>Akane winced at that. She knew this rule well, as her father had drilled it into her so long ago. Unfortunatly, due to recent developments within the past year, she had somewhat forgotten that rule. Ranma getting punished for something she had precariously indulged in managed to bring a few things to light that she would have to watch for in the future.<p>Ranma-chan stood in the doorway, sullenly looking over the sleeping girl. The redhead had been kicked out of her room along with her father in order to make accomidations for the new guest. While her father was now sharing Soun's room, she was forced to stay in the dojo.<p>Ranma half wondered why she hadn't just left and gone back to China for a cure. She was not welcome at school, or at the Tendous, apparently. If anything, she should have taken this as reason to leave.<p>That final self-argument settled it for her. There was nothing for her around there; she would be gone before the night was up.<p>"Did you enjoy seeing me laying here and weak?" A voice said from behind her. Ranma-chan turned back around to find Kodachi glaring at her, "What is it you wanted?"<p>"I was sent up here to check on you, " Ranma replied in an even voice.<p>"So, I am to assume as penance, you are to be my servant girl for the duration of my stay in this... quaint abode?" Kodachi half-sneered. Ranma didn't reply, and turned back around before her own emotions got caught up in it.<p>"Hold, there is something I do require of you." Ranma paused and winced for the second time that day, "I'm hungry, now if you would find something of tolerable sustenance, I will be waiting."<p>"Now listen here you stuck up..." Ranma started, before Kodachi's cries cut her off.<p>"Ohhh! My knee! If not for such a debilitating ailment, might my future in Rhythmic Gynmastics be secure!"<p>Ranma gave a deep sigh, and went downstairs.<p>Ranma-chan arrived in the kitchen, only to recieve a harsh stare from its sole occupant, "You needed something, Ranma?"<p>"She's hungry."<p>"Oh, well let her know I'll prepare something for her, and that I'll be up with it soon."<p>"I was told I needed to..."<p>"I said, *I'll* be up with it soon," Kasumi's voice had reached sub-arctic when she answered again. Ranma remained quiet this time, and ran for the dojo, instead of upstairs. Nabiki watched the other girl head away from the direction she was supposed to be going, and then turned to glare at the kitchen. While it was true her older sister had lived a sheltered life, rarely seeing the type of violent accidents that happened within the dojo, she was acting extremely callous towards their other guest. Regardless, Kasumi was being totally unfair to the pigtailed guest, which didn't sit right with Nabiki at all.<p>Nabiki surmised that witnessing Ranma's brutality first hand shook the eldest Tendou daughter quite a bit, particularly since it was within her own home. Nabiki turned back to the Dojo, and considered what could have happened to Akane that first night he arrived.<p>"Ranma..." The girl breathed, before turning back to the TV, not really focusing on it.<p>Ranma had her legs tucked in, as she sat in the corner of the dojo in the dark. Her stuff was already packed, and she was just waiting for everyone to retire for the night, before striking off on her own.<p>"Ranma?" Akane's voice called out from the entrance. The redhead gave no reply, "Ranma, are you in here?"<p>"What do you want?" the other girl demanded almost in a whisper. At the acknowlegement, Akane walked in the dark until she came to the redhead.<p>"Are you okay?" Ranma was slightly puzzled by the concern in her voice.<p>"Yeah, fine. What do you care about a dangerous freak like me?"<p>Akane sat down next to the redhead, and stared off into the dark, "Kodachi... has a reputation. She was probably here looking for you, in your guy form, I mean; after what you did to her brother."<p>"Yeah, and what do you care?"<p>"Look, what you did was not right, and I don't condone it..." Akane replied, trying not to sound condensending.<p>"Well looky here, your opinion ain't much different from anyone else's here," Ranma-chan turned her eyes away from the raven-haired girl, "Good night, Akane."<p>"But..." Akane continued, "I'm not going to be a hippocrate about it, either." Akane breathed deeply, and started again, "You know the group of boys I fight every morning? Sometimes they just fustrate me to no end. I've come close to severely hurting a few of them, I know. The reason I haven't, wasn't because of any holding back on my part, but probably because they wore protective gear for the most part."<p>"So what do your problems have to do with me?" Ranma asked with a curious lilt.<p>"I'm... I'm just saying, that I guess both of us have to work on our restraint." Akane stood up, and began to leave, "Good night, Ranma."<p>"Yeah, night." the redhead replied, looking down at the dojo floor.<p>As Akane left, she thought about the packed gear she had seen slightly in the moonlight, and immidiately knew what the redhead's plans were. Hopefully from their talk, she would reconsider, as she definitely seemed more alone than anyone Akane had ever met. Ranma needed someone to understand him, and that was the bottom line.<p>Akane resolved, that if the pigtailed girl or pigtailed boy was still there in the morning; she would try her damndest to get to know Ranma.<p>The young man made his way through the forest of Japan, gripping the walking stick he had gained during his trek from China. Finally, he had picked up Saotome's trail. Once he reached the end of it, there will be a reckoning.<p>In the young man's eyes, there was not the hot anger he felt when he and Ranma had battled last; it was now replaced with a cold furer that cried out for more than vengance, but for spilt blood. He had already set himself that his and Ranma's next fight would be their last, one way or another. One of them shall not be walking away alive.<p>"Ranma, once I find you, you're dead," he said with a cryogenic tone that sent animals in his proximity scurrying away in instinctual terror.<p>Docter Tofu pondered to himself, as he lay in bed. From what he had been told, Ranma become exeedingly violent when attacked, sometimes even going as far as using possibly deadly force to end a conflict almost before it began. Even in the most hardened fighters, that wasn't something all that common, he knew. From what he saw, Ranma didn't seem all that hard at all. Her fierce and stony solid attitude not withstanding, Ranma seemed more like she possibly was...<p>Tofu rolled over at the thought, "Ranma, we're going to need to talk soon."<p>Mousse looked around at his sparse accomidations he was offered in the free hostile. This trip was not about luxury, he knew, though he had wished for a bit more. He shook his head slightly, reminding himself of his mission. The young man that was cursed by Jusenkyo, Ranma, was going to pay for what happened to Shampoo.<p>The Chinese boy growled in fustration, as he knew he was nowhere ready to take on the boy, yet. Fortunatly, Mousse was patient, and as long as Shampoo was crippled by his inhumane actions, he could afford to wait, and savor the revenge he would recieve come the future.<p>But until then, he would have to practice until perfection. There could be no room for error when he faces Ranma.<p>None at all.
