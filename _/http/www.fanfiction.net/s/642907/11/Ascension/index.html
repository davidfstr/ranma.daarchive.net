</div>Ranma 1/2<br/>Ascension<p>"NO! GET ME HERB, AND GET HIM NOW! STOP HIM THEN! HE MUST NOT CONFRONT RANMA!" Cologne yelled into the phone with a hostile tone. Ranma just alerted everyone who may have realized this was a supernatural event to his werabouts, and those who were hotheaded enough to attempt to take their vengence were not long for this world.<p>The situation was becoming even more fustratingly dire, as Ranma now drew attention to himself for unknown reasons. Prince Herb had gone to investigate the matter personally, and his only hope was that one of his people could get to him before he attempted to battle Ranma.<p>Individual battles with the new God would be completely fruitless, even if Ranma hadn't fully accustomed himself to infinite might. The display of raw power a few moments ago had proven that easily. Everyone in the Tendou home had been severely shaken by the phenominon of the sky suddenly being blanketed by a massive red beam of power that shot off into space. None of them knew the point of it, but from the way the air was still charged from where they were, they knew it wasn't something they wanted to be on the recieving end of. None of them knew of the hundreds of vessels carrying thousands of sentient beings that it had completely enveloped, snuffing out lives before they could even realize they no longer existed on this plane of mortality.<p>Ukyo was curled up in a corner; the sight they had just seen had shaken her far more than the others had. She knew that was Ranma's doing, as everyone else had realized, and she knew that he would not hesitate to use that might against anyone who stood in his way. He already killed his own family out of some construed feeling of honor; he honestly felt he was doing them a favor by killing them in person than letting them fall victim to the Great Culling. Ranma loved his mother to death, and everyone who had met Godai had instantly fell in love with the young babe. If he killed them without restraint, he would easily turn do the same to her.<p>Ukyo had no allusions to how Ranma had felt about her anymore; three years thinking had a tendency to clarify things. But it still hurt to think that her once fiancee and best friend would almost casually strip her from life if she were to stand against him. Ukyo had decided, though, that she owed it to her past friend to take him down, no matter the cost.<p>Mousse continued to look into the sky with an incredulous expression. There was just no way they would be able to overcome that. Ranma was so far beyond them now that harboring any notions of victory was in itself a futile endeavor. With the last display of power, Ranma had effectively defeated them before the true battle had even begun.<p>Mint and Lime remained stoic. Their concerns for their leader did not show in their expressions, but inside they were each feeling the turmoil of not being there when he would need them the most. It had crossed their minds that it would still be a moot point, and he would be just as dead then as he was now; only difference is they would have to die later than him.<p>The two Kuno siblings knew the least of what was going on, but whatever they saw was indeed more powerful than anything they could comprehend. Even Tatewake's mentally addled mind did not relish having to battle whatever it was that cut the sky to bleed.<p>"Brother... Tate.." Kodachi looked to her brother with intense worry. He nodded in reply, took her hand into his, and gave it a light squeeze.<p>Ryoga didn't feel anything, as the same for Nabiki. There wasn't anything more they could lose, and it is said that a man who has lost everything fears nothing. The recent events were just as important to them as each snowflake that had fallen to the ground earlier.<p>Shampoo hid from the others so that she could grieve for the loss of one she had loved so much, for the second time. She was pretty sure that beam was ment to destroy something, and pitied whoever was the victim of it. And as Ranma had used severe overkill for such a matter, he was too far gone to even petition for penance for his actions. Any apologies she had heard from him after his return would be completely hollow to her.<p>Cologne despaired just as much as the others. She herself knew the full affect the energy beam would have. The air had already warmed up seven degrees from its passing, which would throw the world weather patterns amok. She could very well hear the people out on the streets suddenly seeking forgiveness from whatever god or gods they have offended and were to recieve the wrath of. As the planet would begin to destroy itself, its people would willingly give into their fears, and be their own ends before Earth could do it for them. If anything were to be put right, they would have to convince Ranma to do so...<p>They would have better chance robbing a God of his might...<p>The elderly woman suddenly perked as if she just had a sudden revelation, and redoubled her shouting and cursing over the phone in order to get in contact with Herb or anyone in remote command. She just about completely lost her composure when the phone hung up, but blinked when it rang again.<p>Herb recognized the former Matriarch's voice over the cell phone, "Elder Cologne of the Amazon Tribe, you wished to speak with me?" He nodded, and then replied, "Well, I am currently away from my domain, and this number apparently does not have call waiting, so... Oh, I'm on my cell phone, I use my own power to boost the signal. It's remarkably... that is not a concern at the moment," Herb turned to Ranma, who was sitting on a rock eating a fruit, "He won't let anyone close to him anyhow. It does not look like we have much choice but to wait for you, really, that is if you have any idea on how to get past the barrier he has imposed."<p>Cologne replied in thanks for his prompt response, and hung up the phone. Ranma was waiting for them. He wanted confrontation with his old family and friends. It still wasn't in his nature to gloat, so she was not sure what reason he would have for doing so.<p>"Everyone," Cologne shouted, "it is of dire importance that we get to China as fast as possible. Does anyone have a mode of transportation that would allow us to do so?" All eyes fell on the Kunos.<p>The pale blue sphere of light slowly settled to the ground of the Mizaki shrine, and then dissappated to reveal an unsatched Tsunami, Tenchi, Yosho, Washu, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Kiyone. She had acted quickly, and saved those she knew to. Unfortunately, doe to her haste, she could only rescue a handful of people, and due to Sasami's influence over her conciousness, she only thought to save those she knew closest.<p>Once they were firmly settled onto the ground, Tsunami collapsed to her knees in tears for those she had left behind. Yosho blinked, and noted where they were. He had witnessed the sudden flash of red that suddenly enveloped them like the sun's rays, but until now he didn't know what it was.<p>"Just what the HELL was that?" Shouted Ryoko. Unlike her companions, she had the accellerated vision to witness the beam just totally overtake them.<p>"They're... they're all dead..." Tsunami whispered with a wide and tear soaked expression.<p>"Dead? What happened?" Tenchi asked, no less confused by everyone else.<p>"Some sort of weapon... it destroyed every one of the ships that had arrived with ours," Washu said somberly, having deduced what happened.<p>"Every..." Yosho whispered himself, "But THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! There is nothing on Earth that could even begin to have the capacity to do that, much less in one mass blow."<p>"I don't think it was of Earthen origin," Washu commented, "I think that was the murderer we were looking for in the first place."<p>"Wait, you mean to tell me that whatever it was managed to destroy over a dozen full fleets worth of battle ships like it was NOTHING?" Ryoko shouted incredulously. Tenchi paled at the realization. It wasn't just the horridness of the act, but the fact that he lead them all to their deaths.<p>Ryo-oki noted the young man starting to sway, and alerted Ryoko to catch him before he hit the ground. Kiyone herself looked completely and utterly shellshocked, as Mihoshi still had a cold air of professionalism about her.<p>"Do you know where it came from?" Mihoshi asked, startling everyone else by her calmly relayed question.<p>"Er... yes..." Washu called her subspace computer to the fore, and entered in a few calculations, "From the ion charge in the air, I would predict that the blast came from somewhere within the deep of China. Here we are, an area known as the Quangxi Province of China, that's where it originated."<p>"Tsunami, can you get us there to investigate whatever it is?" Mishoshi's sudden grasp of control over the situation surprised everyone again, and within moments, they were on their way.<p>On one of the Japanese western ports...<p>"Hey..."<p>The red headed swordman turned to look at whoever hailed him. The stalky black man with round rim glasses stared into the yellow hued and intense eyes of the apparent Samurai in faded red, and fought down the urge to shiver, "Are you offering me passage across the sea?"<p>It was the question of the day, as many were trying to find a way to China, many powerful beings, "Aye, we have enough room, and we all know that this is going to be something that we'll need all the help we can get."<p>The reborn Hikokiri Battusai nodded, and walked up the plank onto the deck of what appeared to be a submerine of sorts. He would have been grateful for the ride, but the only emotion left in his heart was those that comprised the need for revenge. Promises be damned, Kenshin would kill the one who cowardly struck Kaori low from the distance. His left hand gripped the sheath that carried the Kamiya Honor blade that had been secretly hidden for generations within it. Both of them felt the need to spill blood.<p>Behind him approached an almost ghost like entity; like a marionette blazing as bright as the sun itself alit with the Thunder god's full wrath. The Oni princess looked towards the black man with dead eyes, making him not relish what he had to request.<p>"Um, would you be able to tone down the fireworks? This is a highly sensitive vessel, after all," He asked, pointing to the Nautilus.<p>The Oni Princess looked down at her hands with detached observation, "I... cannot control it anymore." The crewmember of the Nautilis nodded, and attempted to think of a tactful and non-life forfeiting way to ask her if she could possibly ask another ship for passage.<p>In the background, ships continued to fill like armies planning to invade.
