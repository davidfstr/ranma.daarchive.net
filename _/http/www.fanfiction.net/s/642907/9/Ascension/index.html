</div>Ranma; Ascension<p>Nabiki continued up the trail to the farm ahead. Her expression was worn and tired; not from her audious trek, but from previous events. The remaining Tendou started finally reached the main door, and after a moment's hesitation, knocked.<p>She wasn't in a hurry, so the she spared the time with dead patience until the resident of the Unryuu pig farm. After a few minutes, Ryoga opened up the door.<p>The young man had the same dead expression she was wearing on his unwashed face. It was still streaked with tears, and his appearance was totally unkept.<p>"What." He asked, the young woman standing before him heard the finality of the period instead of the question mark. His voice sounded the same, exept for the hollow feeling it radiated; Nabiki easily knew why Ryoga was now the one who answered the phone.<p>"It's Ranma's fault," Nabiki said simply in a voice that was just as hollow, if not also colder. If Ryoga didn't know better or cared, he would have sworn he was talking to a mechanical construct instead of another human being.<p>Ryoga nodded, the feintest flicker of vengence sparking in his eye, like two flints struck in eternal darkness.<p>"[The Sanitation situation is currently..]"<p>::Click::<p>"[Christan population has dubbed 'The Rapture', as...]"<p>::Click::<p>"[Doomsday cult bombed the...]"<p>::Click::<p>"[The American City of Chicago has been put under quarentine due to the escape of a deadly...]"<p>::Click::<p>"[...blames Iran and launched their devistating biological weaponry...]"<p>::Click::<p>"[We have yet to establish the cause of the mass...]"<p>::Click::<p>"[...remaining American and Nato forces have been called in to...]"<p>::Click::<p>"[..panese Diet has issued a statement that...]"<p>Cologne numbly flipped through the channels. Even without having watched the news on the late Dr. Tofu's satilite system, she already knew the problem was world wide, and beyond. This was something unfathomable even to her, even with her three hundred years experience, along with five thousand years of history. She had always believed that Gods welded their absolute power with absolute responsibility, arbeit at many times becoming petty and rash, they usually remained just. It had never occured to her that someone could gain that power and use it for such an absolute tragedy.<p>It was simple as this, Ranma was insane. Even if omnipotence hadn't totally overwhelmed his psyche, he was too far gone after Akane's death. With the most spiteful curse she could imagine, she wished Ranma had died with the Tendou girl. Of course, she would not stay dead, and was apparently the influence of his actions. Cologne felt her overwhelming aura when she caught sight of Akane, but didn't notice it until she saw her. Just what was Akane? She was too, too far beyond a mere 'ghost'. In fact, she seemed to be so much *more* than anything Cologne encountered. The former Amazon Matriarch suspected that Herb or Saffron combined would have been nothing more than a campfire compared to Akane's blazing sun. The girl was weilding power on a fundamental level like she was an integral part of everything that is.<p>"Great-Grandmother, Nabiki is on her way with Ryoga," Shampoo stated, as she walked into the main room of the loft. They had taken up at least temperary residence at the clinic, as Cologne was one of the few left in Nerima that had the capability of utilizing it's facilities. After 'the Culling', as she had dubbed it, the world was thrown into total turmoil. Hospitals suddenly found themselves completely understaffed with all the sudden accidents that suddenly struck, while what rescue workers that were left were severely overtaxed. Airports, docks, trainstations, and other mass transportation was in ruins. Nations were blaming each other as if it were an intentional attack on them that may have backfired. World Economies could forget about recovering from the sudden devistaton, and would be severely lucky if all didn't regress to primal 'survival of the fittest' ideals. Many people are following their loved ones to oblivion, not finding the power to survive without them, while others are damning them for leaving them behind. Religions are in an uproar, igniting even millinea dead conflicts between such major ones as Christian and ancient Pagan religions. The world was a sad state, to say the least.<p>Cologne nodded to her Great-Granddaughter and dismissed her. Shampoo left the clinic, and went to check up on those who were currently staying at the Tendou home. She let herself in, and found Tarou still completely griefed. Shampoo couldn't blame him, as he lost both his wife and his unborn child in one swift motion. The Amazon runner sat in meditation, preparing for a battle she had no idea would come, but knew she would have to face it. Herb had sent his most trusted associates, Lime and Mint to assist with whatever was being dealt in Nerima, stating he would be with them as soon as he could restore order in the Quangxi Providence. Kiima had told Herb to relay that Saffron would be arriving as soon as he completed his transformation.<p>"What doe the Amazon Matriarch report?" Mint enquired of Shampoo. He was now tall and lithe in form, and he had also grown quite a bit in maturity as well. He was well known as Herb's ambassador throughout the Chinese provinces for his wolf like cunning in negotiations and always serious attitude with a hint of feralness that always edged his voice.<p>"She has nothing to say until everyone else arrives," Shampoo replied quietly. She did not relish giving them the news, and did not want to face any confrontation if at all possible. Mint noticed her subdued tone, and nodded to drop the issue.<p>"Your Grandmother knows something of what's going on, I want to hear it RIGHT NOW!" Tarou shot up with a furious expression. Both Mint and Lime stepped between Shampoo and Tarou.<p>"We'll all find out what was the cause of the Great Death soon enough. If the revered Matriarch has decided that it is not nessesary to tell us immidiately, I assume that it is because there is nothing we can do about it yet," Mint replied in the calmest voice he could muster. Unfortunately, to Tarou, everything currently sounded menacing.<p>In a quick motion, he pulled out his water gourd, and dumped it over his head. In a swift motion, both of Herb's most trusted went into action. Mint seemed to blink out of existance, as Lime slammed into the large beast with a shoulder charge. Tarou was sent flying through the living room and through a wall into the snow covered back yard. Mint reappeared on Tarou's back, and tied his octopus arms together. Tarou quickly brought himself to standing, shrugging off the wolf-boy on his back, just before a sizable length of chain wrapped him like a metallic mummy, leaving only his head exposed.<p>Mousse and Ukyo both stepped into the back yard, and Ukyo walked up to the downed beast and dumped a steaming kettle of water onto him. Every fighter was ready to reinstigate the battle if Tarou decided to push issues. They were mildly shocked when he curled up and went back ot quietly crying.<p>Nabiki arrived about that time with Ryoga and both Kuno siblings. "Did we arrive at a bad time?" Kuno stated with misplaced mirth, "And Nabiki, no comment as to who would be the one supplying the expenditures for replacement of the wall?"<p>"Stuff it, brother," Kodachi stated without her tone of madness.<p>"I'll contact Cologne, so that we may now find out what this is all about." With that, Nabiki left for the phone. It wasn't long when the elderly woman arrived.<p>"This problem... it goes farther than any of you truly realize," she started, hoping she could instill just how large a scope the situation was.<p>"Well, from the news reports, I would guess it's worldwide," Ukyo interjected, "Just WHAT is it that Ranma did?"<p>"It's actually more of the whole universe," Cologne said wryly, earning rather shocked looks from all who were able to still show emotion, "And as for what Ranma did, was greater than any deeds of the combined devils of every plane of the Hells could ever contrive. What I am about to tell you is knowlege very, very few have been privy to, and should have remained that way, if events hadn't forced my hand. This planet once held a great power, something was essential to the way of everything. It was the power of balance, balance for the whole Universe. It didn't originate on this planet, since it was far older than this planet itself. In fact, it's far older than anything in the universe, since it was part of the universe itself.<p>"This isn't making any sense," Lime stated with a growl.<p>Cologne ignored him, and continued, "For this particular force, there was two guardians, one is born every generation, while the other is reborn every thousand years. They are the Dragon and the Pheonix."<p>"So, Lord Herb and Saffron," Mint concluded.<p>"The Amazons were but a part of the guardians forces. Everyone in the Quaingxi province had a duty to keep watch over the power the Gods bestowed into our care. Apparently Ranma has now acquired that power for himself."<p>"Ranma's some sort of God now?" Nabiki asked with a sterile voice.<p>"Ranma isn't 'some sort of God'... he *is* THE God. That power he gathered was only but part of whole, and would only work once it was in unison with all other parts. It was hypothosized that there were five or six parts; Balance, which resided on this planet, Power, Soul, Reality, Infinity, and Eternity. When they are brought together, the weilder would have all there is at his beckon."<p>"So Ranma is an omnipotent being and decided to just up and kill as many people as possible everywhere? That doesn't make sense, and where does Akane come into all this!" Ukyo demanded, finding everything Cologne told them so hard to believe.<p>"You are essentially correct, though I do not know his motives, nor do I know where the long thought dead Akane Tendou has to do with all this. I will tell you that Akane has... changed since we last saw her."<p>"Changed? How so?" Ryoga asked, with a tint of curiosity in his voice which was more intellectual than anything else.<p>"I am not for certain, but I would presume that she may be the reason Ranma obtained his Godhood in the first place."<p>"Also, you stated that one of these... powers or something resided on this planet. Are we to assume that the others were somewhere else in space? How did Ranma manage to go wherever and get these things?" Ukyo enquired.<p>"I do not know everything," Cologne replied with a weary tone, "Perhaps the same way he managed to get away from us the other day when we were... distracted."<p>"You mean he used the Umisenken? How would that help him get off planet?" Ukyo retorted.<p>Cologne looked directly at Ukyo, "That was not the Umisenken, I assure you."<p>Yosho's expression remained stern. He had turned down the thrown of Jurai. With Azusa's death along with roughly half the Juraian population, the kingdom was thrown into turmoil. It may have well destroyed itself, if not for the return of key members of the royal family. Funaho was desperately attempting to hold everything together herself, but it was apparent that she was under the severe strain of the task. When her son had returned, she pleaded with him to take his place as Emperor of Jurai, but was steadfastly refused. Instead, Yosho suggested that Tenchi take the mantle, as he was most befitted for it.<p>That is how they ended up in their present situation. Yosho had forgotten how manipulative the 'advisors' of the Jurai Royal Family could be, and managed to convince Tenchi to allow the entire Juraian fleet to deal with the threat, and were currently en route to where Washu had stated the origin point was... Earth.<p>Yosho looked over to his stern faced grandson. Tenchi was currently too set on revenge to think straight, and he had wished he had seen it before suceeding throne to the young man. Ryoko herself was looking out a viewscreen into the dead depths of space with a neutral expression. Yosho knew she may not have gotten along with Princess Aeka, Ryoko loved her like a sister. An annoying, rival sister arbeit, and possibly even something more. Tsunami stayed near the Juraian Tree of the ship, never moving from her self imposed post. The catastrophy that swept through the universe affected her in ways he could not even begin to understand. As it was, Sasami's humanity was the only thing keeping her reigned.<p>Off ship, in one of the Galaxy Police Vessels, both Mihoshi and Kiyone had expressions of total proffessionalism. On Kiyone it was expected, on Mihoshi it was something few people had ever seen of her. Contrary to everyone's beliefs, when the situation was dire enough, Mihoshi could show all exactly why she was a first class Galaxy Police Detective, without argument.<p>They would eventually be joined by the Oni forces, among others, as they made their way to the destined planet. And there would be a reckoning.<p>Heaven was in turmoil... God was gone. Urd, along with Poeth and other remaining deities struggled to bring Yggdasil back to a fluid order. It was thrown for a total loop when an outside force that reigned even over the world system itself kicked in, and pulled the proverbal rug from under it's base. Not only that, he who reigns over all suddenly dissappeared along with half the gods in Heaven; mirroring what has happened on Earth and in Hell. It would be a small consolence that the demons down below were having their own problems and could not cause any more added trouble.<p>Hild growled, her domain was being wretched from her hands. Most of the remaining major demons were fighting amongst themselves over what had happened. Some even had the audacity to take claim over being the one to cost such a catastrophic situation that NO demon with sense would favor. There was a great deal of problems it wrought for them as well as everyone else.<p>In a corner recess of Hell, a lone chaos demon trembled at the though of being found out. Maybe tampering with the life of Ranma Saotome wasn't the best of pasttimes to indulge in?<p>A portal opened up in a vast valley in the Quangxi Province, emitting a pigtailed young man and his consort. They held a wordless communication between each other, and when it was finished, Ranma sat himself on a rock and began fiddling with his ring, while Akane stood by.<p>All they needed to do now was wait
