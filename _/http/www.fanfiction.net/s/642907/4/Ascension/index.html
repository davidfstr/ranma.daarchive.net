</div>Ranma 1/2<br/>Ascension<p>A young looking warrior stared off into what could be assumed as the sky, and smiled slightly. Someone had decided to take up the task he had passed off himself so long ago. Someone sought to become the fittest being there was; to become what mortals were not meant to be. He scoffed at the notion; of course they could be anything they wanted to. It was simply a matter of evolution. This recent development meant dire consequences for *all* life, but he wouldn't interfere.<p>If he were to do so, it would disrupt the very order of the universe; Survival of the fittest.<p>True love cannot ressurect the dead...<p>But It can bring death to cherish it.<p>"Akane, Mother..." Nabiki kneeled before the tombstone, and bowed her head, "I... that is we..." The young woman paused to gather herself, and when she realized what she was doing, she chuckled and started over again, "I... need your help. Someone killed the Saotomes, all of them but Ukyo." Nabiki sniffled before continuing again, "Cologne and Dr. Tofu think Ranma did it."<p>The young woman looked away from the stones to the tree behind it, her eyes following the dead and bare branches, "There's no way he could have done it, we *all* saw him die. He..."<p>The wind caressed Nabiki across her shoulder, and she felt a mild comfort from it that gave her strength to continue. Her mother's presence when it came in contact with her when she was alive always managed to calm Nabiki a great deal; it was something her late parent was only capable of when the girl found things too much for her.<p>"Cologne says she has a way to find Ranma if he's... alive. I'm hoping that they never do." Nabiki tilted her head, as if pondering a question, "I know it would not give us an answer to who possibly could have done it, but I think the possibility of Ranma being a killer would... be far greater than an unknown one not facing justice."<p>"Tofu asked me to figure out who would be best to confront Ranma, but only those nessesary. Ranma was always pretty dangerous, but he had honor, and love." Nabiki turned to her sister's grave with a slight smirk, "Yeah, sis, Ranma did love you. He loved you more than any of us had realized. But you already knew that, I mean after three years ago when he... when he went to join you. It was funny though, when both of you were too stubburn to admit it, even when it was blindingly obvious to everyone involved."<p>Nabiki wiped a tear from her eyes, and stared at the ground before her late sister's marker, "I'm not blaming you for what happened to him, but your death destroyed him; in a way, it nearly destroyed all of us. You were more important than family, Akane-chan, you were a part of what held everything together here. I mean even with your rivaly over Ranma, none of us could have survived a whole year without you around. Heh, I would imagine Ranma's head would have exploded from a swollen ego if you hadn't been there to curb it every so often. But I degress, I was here to ask you something..."<p>Nabiki took out a list of names, and laid it before the stone marker, "Here's a list of Ranma's most powerful enemies and allies. I... I need to know if I'll be doing the right thing, telling them. If it is Ranma, we'll definitely need them; if it isn't, they may be powerful enough to bring whoever it was to justice. But, I'm pretty sure you see the problems with all of them. None of them you could say are... team players, and they could hinder us more than help. What do you think, Akane? Mom?"<p>Nabiki subconciously waited for a reply, but conciously realized how silly it was to sit in silence. She actually visited her mother and sister's graves and 'talked' to them in order to get her own thoughts straight. She would imagine that they were there to confort her at times when she needed them, but knew to herself that this was just a fantasy. Still, it never hurt her to indulge.<p>"I best get going," Nabiki stated, and reached down for the paper. A leaf floated down, and landed upon the list before she retrieved it. Nabiki blinked, and looked at the tree... the dead tree. The only tree around for a good ways.<p>"Heh, I get it," Nabiki stated with a slight mirth, "I guess anything is possible."<p>Ranma breathed heavily, while staring back at his fallen opponent. That was by far the greatest of the challenges he had faced, but it was finally over. The pigtailed young man approached the alter with a slight limp, and place his right hand upon it. It started to glow a vibrant amber color, that congested around his hand, and then was absorbed into the ring on his hand.<p>He now had five of the essences he needed, now he need await for the location of the final one. Buf first...<p>"Akane, let me gather myself before this next challenge. It wouldn't do us any good if I were to fail when so close." The portal opened, and Ranma stepped through it. He decided that he needed only a day to recouperate, before attempting to gain the final essence.<p>"Blasted thing takes too long to work!" Cologne grumbled, checking up on the orb once again. Two days ago, she had brought it to the Saotome home to attune itself to Ranma's ki. Now it was attempting to locate the direction of the young man's whereabouts. It would take a day and a night to accomplish it's task, but she gave it a bit of extra time just in case.<p>"Cologne, maybe Ranma is... dead after all," Dr. Tofu enquired, "Maybe..."<p>"You know a great deal about ki," Cologne interrupted, "What we felt could *not* be faked."<p>"Maybe, maybe not," the doctor replied, "We don't know everything about ki, after all."<p>Cologne turned a hard glare to the doctor, "You don't honestly believe that load of bull you're trying to hand me? I'll tell you, Sonny-boy, I've been three hundred years around the block, and there isn't much I don't know about these things. So don't go trying to teach Granny to suck eggs!"<p>"I meant no disrespect," Tofu apologised.<p>"It's quite all right. This whole situation has gotten all of us on edge, and WILL THIS DAMNABLE ANCIENT JUNK WORK?"<p>"Cologne, mighty big temper you got there," Happosai landed, carrying a sack.<p>"Happosai..." Cologne sneered, as she spied the bag, "Even in these times, you can't help but indulge in your pathetic infatuation with undergarments."<p>"You need to learn to be civil, ya old bat," Happosai shot back, and then dropped the sack to reveal several treasures."<p>"So, you've come to return Amazon treasures? I have to admit that I was not suspecting..."<p>"I brought *my* treasures here so that we can go through them and see if we can find anything useful to locate The Saotomes' murderer."<p>"What objects would you have to detect Ranma?" Cologne asked.<p>"I never said 'Ranma', I said the Saotome's killer," Happosai corrected.<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes again, "I've already been over this with the young whelp, Happosai." Tofu brissled at the comment, but refrianed from responding.<p>The ancient pervert gave Cologne a disarming smile, before picking up a jewel from the pile on the sack. He stared intensely at the former Amazon Matriarch, while the jewel began to change color. It turned a sky blue, and then Happosai let his battle aura out. Tofu suppressed a chuckle at Cologne's pole-axed expression.<p>"I admit there are... some things that have slipped my knowlege," Cologne replied sheepishly.<p>Happosai let the imitated battle aura drop, "Now then, let's get to work. We have a student of mine to avenge.<p>Ranma looked towards Akane, as she went about her duties. He understood that what he was seeing was only a physical representation, since he could not fathom the true 'reality' of her task. He knew what she was, but he didn't love her any less. If anything, it proved to him that what he felt, and what she returned, was more real than any possible experience he had ever came across. Thinking about this, his resolve grew that much stronger, as he decided that his wait need not go much longer.<p>He looked to his ring, awaiting for the location of his final destination before moving onto the next phase of his task. When it was revealed, Ranma laughed so loud that it even caught his love's attention.<p>Ranma looked towards Akane with a loving smile, which Akane returned with a smug one. Behind Ranma opened a portal, and the pigtailed young man stepped through it; thinking to himself that this was already a battle he had won before he had known he had started it.<br/>Ranma breathed heavily, while staring back at his fallen opponent. That was by far the greatest of the challenges he had faced, but it was finally over. The pigtailed young man approached the alter with a slight limp, and place his right hand upon it. It started to glow a vibrant amber color, that congested around his hand, and then was absorbed into the ring on his hand.<p>He now had five of the essences he needed, now he need await for the location of the final one. Buf first...<p>"Akane, let me gather myself before this next challenge. It wouldn't do us any good if I were to fail when so close." The portal opened, and Ranma stepped through it. He decided that he needed only a day to recouperate, before attempting to gain the final essence.<p>Cologne and Happosai cursed the pile of junk that sat in their midst. Nothing had turned up a single trace of who the Saotomes' killer could be. After about a day, they had given up on it possibly being Ranma, since there was no trace of him.<p>"Great Grandmother?" A familiar voice called out from the Restaurant entrance. Cologne sighed, and called down, "Shampoo, come join us upstairs so that we can explain the situation to you."<p>"I also have another grave issue to discuss with you," Shampoo called back, and started up the stairs. Cologne paused, it sounded as if Shampoo was supporting someone upstairs. It didn't take long for the old woman's suspicions to be confirmed, as her Great Granddaughter came in, while holding an Amazon messenger who could barely stand on her own.<p>"By our Ancestors, child, what happened to her?" Cologne asked with a fearful tone.<p>Before Shampoo could speak up, her companion answered in their Amazon dialect, and then the girl looked down to the floor, as if she had failed in some grievous way, and stated something with great remourse that made the former matriarch go completely pale.<p>Happosai looked between Cologne and the two other women, noting for former's shock and the two latters' grim expressions, but was unable to follow the conversation, "What? What happened to the pretty lady?"<p>"The Amazons... are no more," Cologne replied with a choke in her voice. Happosai went quiet at the gravity of the statement.<p>Unknown to all in the room, a certain orb generated a small light within it, that shown on the east side of the sphere..<p>Ranma looked down at his ring; it was complete. There was nothing he could no longer do. With this in mind, he decided that it was time to make a trip to Japan...
