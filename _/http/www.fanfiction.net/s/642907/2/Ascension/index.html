</div>Ranma; Ascension<br/>Chapter 1<p>Once upon a time, there was a concept. This concept held infinate power over all life, as it was the finality of it. Since the beginning, this concept carried out its duties without question, without remourse, and because of this, it was alienated.<p>Over time, the concept grew lonely. It was far beyond sentience, but observing life caused it to develop such things as emotions. It yearned for the companionship that was celebrated in life, and grieved for it would always be unatainable.<p>One soul had caught its attention from time to time, a soul that during every rebirth was destined for great things. Everytime the concept touched the soul, if experienced... elation. Eventually, the concept decided that it wanted to experience more.<p>It was not unheard of, but immensely rare. The concept requested of its kin a boon, and after much confrence, it was granted.<p>Upon the rebirth of the soul that had taken the concept's attention, the concept was born as a soul.<p>The concept as a soul born on earth experienced the full spectrum of emotions that any human would feel, exilleration of a task well done, peace from security, remourse from the death of a close one, anger from exasperation. One other feeling that the concept felt, one that lingered like a palpable and tantalizing flavor upon its tongue; ambition.<p>Through the course of the concepts given life, it grew competitive, and resentful when that which it owned was attempted to be taken away. Through its life, it experienced many peculiarities that most mortals would never come across; the final one managing to end its given life on earth.<p>Upon returning to its true form, the concept still harbored many of the feelings and experiences that it gained during its given life. It now felt the need to grow further than it had been for eons. The soul that held the concepts intrest would prove useful.<p>Ranma kneeled before the drainage ditch, washing his hands of the blood that they were splattered with. He felt a presence behind him, "I said my good byes to those that mattered to me most." Ranma stood up, ignoring the red stained water that dripped from his hands, as he stared across the canal, "You gave them the peace they deserve?" He knew the answer without turning to see the nod, "Then, I go to do what you wanted me to do."<p>Ranma chuckled when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and lay his own upon it, "You know? I know I would have told ya I'd go to the ends of the universe for you," the pigtailed young man turned to the figure that was slightly shorter than him, and continued, "Kinda funny you want me to prove it." With that, he bent down, and kissed the raven-haired girl on the lips, entwining his fingers with hers.<p>"Even for the impossible, I'd won't fail you again, Akane."<p>The Tendous sat in mouning over the deaths of the Saotome family. It was a pleasant funeral for them, and it was a tragedy that the true blood of the lineage had been wiped out in such a brutal manner.<p>Ukyo sat quietly, the last remaining Saotome. Genma and Nodoka had adopted her after Ranma's dissappearance, though she barely spent much time with the family. Without Ranma, she didn't truly feel a part of it. Even though this was the case, she still felt immense grief over their passing.<p>Cologne sat solomnly, contemplating the murder. The cuts were so fine, nothing material could accomplish it. She recognized the technique that felled Genma and Nodoka as part of the Yamasenken, and decided that she would personally see to the hunt for Ryuu Kumon. She would talk with Soun about it later on.<p>Soun himself could not cry any longer, as he had run out of tears with the death of his youngest daughter. In fact, he had run out of emotions all together. He state expressionlessly, not really thinking of anything, just waiting for it to end. It wasn't a healthy existance, but it was the only one he was capable of now.<p>Nabiki's face remained hidden under her black veil, allowing no one to see her expression. Her thoughts were in turmoil, after losing the last thing to a mother other than Kasumi she had known for years. Nodoka would be missed more than she could help.<p>Kasumi handled her feelings as usual for anyone having experienced this tragedy. Fortunatly, Dr. Tofu was able to provide her comfort before she could succomb completely to grief; he would make sure that his wife would be okay, no matter what else happens.<p>The doctor himself himself was coming to similar conclusions as Cologne. The attack was ki based, so that leveled the list of murderers down signifigantly. He also wanted to explore the Saotome's former home, to see what clues there were. The ki from the murderer may still be around.<p>Dr. Tofu walked up to Ukyo, and placed a hand on her shoulder, "Ukyo, my sincerest condolences for your loss. If it's means anything, I have an idea that may help us find the murderer of your family.<p>Ukyo barked a sharp laugh, "They weren't really my family, but it lies upon me to avenge them. hmph, I have to say I never really was much good at revenge."<p>The doctor patted her shoulder in comfort, "I would say that's a good thing. Its best to let justice deal with this."<p>"JUSTICE?" Nabiki shouted, furiously, "THERE WAS NO JUSTICE IN THEIR DEATHS? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT ANY WILL SERVE THEM BEYOND?"<p>"Nabiki, please," Soun commanded, though with not much force.<p>"The girl is right," Cologne interjected, "Besides, we already can assume who the murderer is."<p>"Oh?" the doctor turned to the old woman.<p>"Ryuu Kumon," Soun answered for her.<p>"Correct. The attack on the Saotomes was ki based. In fact, it was an attack that was invented by Genma Saotome himself, and entrusted to Amazon care after he retired from martial arts. Only a handful of people know the technique. Three of them are dead, I have an alibi if you wish to list me as a suspect, and Shampoo is still in the South Americas wandering from the last time I talked with her, the day before the murders."<p>"I see, so that only leaves Ryuu," Tofu concluded, "but are you sure it was this technique that was the cause of thier deaths? I mean there are several that I can list myself that would have similar results."<p>"I am positive," the old woman replied gravely, "but if you wish to confirm this for yourself, I will accompany you on whatever you have planned."<p>"I think I will, it's too circumstantial at this point, and a ki signature would be the best way at the moment. After all, I knew the signatures of every fighter in Nerima, and many that had a beef with the Saotomes."<p>"Interesting idea," Cologne agreed, "I do not expect anything different, but your plan is a sound one."<p>"Let us know your findings, as it is the duty of the Anything Goes School to avenge the loss of any of its students, former or otherwise," Happosai came from his hiding place. It was made extremely apparent that he was not welcome around any more, but made it a point to stay. Though he did questionable things, he still felt remourse over the loss of the Saotomes, from Ranma to Godai, and would bring their killer justice if by his hands or anyone else's.<p>"Happosai, I see you have returned," Soun commented.<p>The old man nodded, "I understand I'm not appreciated, but at least allow me to take part in this. I owe it to Genma as his master, for failing him... and you."<p>"That almost sounds sincere," Cologne replied, with a touch of acid in her voice.<p>Happosai turned towards the old woman, "Even the elderly can mature."<p>Later, three figures silently entered the deathly quiet home. The blood stains were still apparent, even with the little light they were supplied by the outside moon..<p>"It truly was a shame," Toku stated, as they looked around the living room, spying the broken and charred crib.<p>"Yes, their young one had as much potential as his older brother did. It's a tragedy that it was cut short before it could be known."<p>"And my final chance for an heir..." Happosai trailed off, feeling as morose as the situation demanded. Before the meloncoly could side track them, they set to task.<p>"Well, I guess it's time to go to work," Dr. Tofu stated, closing his eyes and enhancing his own senses as he was taught. Cologne did the same,. As they both suspected, it was a familiar signature, and as they delved deeper...<p>"Kami!"<p>"Great and revered Ancestors!"<p>Ranma twisted the ring on his finger, the one given to him by Akane. It would be vital for him to have it, for his quest would be finished before it began. He had expected it would be an amazingly long journey, but with the help of the woman who loved him, he could easily make the trek.<p>Ranma nodded in grim determination, as he ventured into parts of reality unknown, intent on not returning until his current task was complete.
