</div>Ranma 1/2<br/>Ascension<p>"Is it real? What I feel, Could it be?<br/>You and me?<br/>Till the end of time.<br/>World apart, take my hand, hold it tight,<br/>It's true love.<br/>You know I gotta be..."<p>"I Gotta Be" by Jagged Edge<p>Ranma glanced towards the the edge of his self-erected barrier that was being hammered upon by several seemingly powerful beings. He sighed softly to himself, knowing that they would be as tenatious as he would be in order to get in. Revenge made one forgo any rationale when it came to such things. He held control over everything, and though he knew they would not know that, he hoped they would wise up soon, he was starting to get a headache.<p>He looked towards Akane, who was dressed in a black kimono that sucked in all light that hit it like a black hole, with a white obi... or was that blood red, it was hard to tell the by the nature of it, and sitting seiza on the grass with her eyes closed. He idly wondered what she was thinking, and immidiately chided himself. She didn't *think* per say, she was well beyond such a minute concept, which brought him to the reason he was doing all this.<p>Ranma finished his pear, and tossed the core with a back handed motion towards the barrier. It effortlessly passed through the invisible field, and landed on the ground outside. It rapidly decomposed, and the seeds settled into the ground quickly. Within seconds, a sprout grew, then it was a sapling. Moments later, a fully blooming tree with lush pears dangling from its branches stood in the place the fruit core landed. In severe agitation, the fire entity known as Pyron turned his attentions from breaching the field, to reducing the newborn tree to cinders.<p>Ranma looked towards the flame being with irritation, and then shrugged. If they didn't want to accept his gift, he was not going to let it bother him... the jerks. Ranma sighed, they had a right to be angry with him, and he shouldn't fault them for that.<p>"BASTARD! COME OUT AND FACE US!" shouted the angry looking fighter wearing some sort of blue battle armor with white shoulder pads. Ranma fought the urge to tell the guy how rediculous his blond hair looked the way it dangled to his ankles, but thought it best not to provoke them further. Ranma knew how powerful many of them were outside, and skewered their power levels while making them think that they were always only of that ability. It would not due to have one of them get fustrated beyond reason, and nuke the whole planet. Pointless deaths would only serve to make Ranma an angry God.<p>He himself admittadly was getting bored. Him and Akane had been in the barrier for three days now, waiting for those he felt were due the largest cracks at him to arrive. It should be no less than another day, depending on how they decided to travel. Of course, it would be like them to take their time with this... the jerks.<p>Yosho glared intensely at Ranma and shouted to the others who had yet to give up on trying to breach the energy field, "You may as well cease, he won't let us in unless he wants to."<p>"What is he?" a man with talons of a bird of prey, and bat wings that potruded from his demonic head growled, as he looked on, "They both look human, but to be able to control the power he seems to..."<p>"There is nothing human about him," a girl with a mane of pink with a rapier and two rose embroidered rings on one hand stated as she glared with blue eyes bearing hate, "Nothing with a shred of humanity could do what he has done."<p>"Washu, have you found a way to open that barrier?" Mihoshi asked, sitting down on a nearby rock with Kiyone leaning with her back against her.<p>"I can't even figure out what it is!" Washu replied with strain in her voice, "According to all my instrumentation, it's not even *there*!"<p>"That is puzzling," Yosho commented, "could it be some sort of hypnotic suggestion made for us to believe that we are being held at bay?"<p>"No, if that were the case, the energy backlashes many were suffering would not have happened," Kiyone deduced.<p>"Then he sits there just to toy with us?" Leona Heidern asked without much heat.<p>"He's waiting for something," Yosho replied, "it's just not us, apparently. Everyone here may have just been an 'unexpected' result of his actions." Yosho waved to the army behind him. Many of them had already attempted to breech the barrier, and gave up shortly. Even burrowing under it yeilded no results. A few considered leaving, but their sense of duty or need for revenge was much stronger than their fustration. For the time being, they chose to camp with the supplies they brought with them, or what was supplied by the gracious Musk. It was apparent that they were under orders to keep as many as they could in the area, and also act as the keepers of the peace. Several fights had already broken out, with the tension level so high. The must, Amazons, or Pheonix people proved inneffective in quite a few of these to quell hostilities, but many of the more powerful and more responsible that were present were found very helpful. But it was a given that if something were not to happen soon...<p>"Three minutes until arrival point," one of the crewmembers of the large helicopter shouted to the passengers. Cologne nodded in affirmation, and looked towards everyone else.<p>"Now, you all understand what we are to do, correct?" Almost in unison, everyone nodded.<p>"Good, because this plan must not fail if we have any hope. It is a slim chance as it is." Cologne fiddled with the dual colored gem in her pocket that was to be their trump card. It was something she would have been hesitant to use at any time, but time now proved the act of prudence was too far gone a luxury.<p>She looked down to the masses up ahead; they would be the spoilers of this battle, hopefully they could keep Ranma on his toes, and not realize the plans being set in motion that would hopefully lead to his downfall.<p>"Honored Elder," Herb approached Cologne before continuing, "That jewel you had me retrieve, what purpose does it serve?"<p>"That, I cannot tell you. If I were, it would lead to a greater chance of Ranma discovering its purpose, and that would bring everything to..."<p>"Over drop point..." interrupted a crewmember.<p>Ranma looked up, to the humorous sight of the ancient woman descending on a rope from a large helicraft. She landed in front of Ranma, uninhibited by the barrier that kept all others at bay. The rest of the occupants that were to be staying descended into the crowds, searching for those they deemed were responsible, powerful, and hopefully trustworthy enough to help them with what they planned on doing.<p>"Ranma," Cologne greated evenly.<p>"Hello Cologne," Ranma replied, standing from his seat. Akane opened her eyes and looked towards the old woman, a ghost of a smile crossed her face in greeting.<p>"You were waiting for us," Cologne started, looking directly into Ranma's eyes.<p>"Yes, I was."<p>"Why?"<p>Ranma seemed to ponder how he was going to put things, "Well, I figured you would be mad and all."<p>"I see your gift for understatement hasn't been lost in your ascension," Cologne almost deadpanned.<p>Ranma gave a slight chuckle, "You want the rest of the answers..."<p>"They would be helpful."<p>Ranma motioned to Akane, who stood up and approached the other two, "You already know Akane..."<p>Cologne glared at the girl, "This creature is not Akane."<p>Ranma's smirk got bigger, and turned to Akane, "See? I told you she'd figure it out." Akane just nodded impassively towards Ranma. At the emotionless response, Ranma sighed, and turned back to the old woman, "This is why I have done all of this."<p>"Explain."<p>"You see, this is Akane, or rather, what had become Akane, what was born as Akane." Cologne held her tongue at the nonsensical start of his explanation. Ranma continued, "You know how it is about mortals and all getting the attention of the Gods? They fall in love with a mortal soul or something like that, interfering in their lives whenever they are once again in the realm of the living? Well, Akane here apparently had found intrest in me."<p>"She's some sort of Deity?" Cologne enquired.<p>"No, far more than that, something even the deities you know can succomb to. She is a part of what makes the universe tick, and truthfully, she is more, much more than we can comprehend, or at least you can." Ranma said the last part with a slight smirk.<p>"Then what is she?"<p>"She is a part of eternity that took notice of me. She dared find intrest in a mortal soul, and considered what it would be like to intermingle with one on an intimate basis. So, she found a way to become mortal through an avatar, if you will, and had it fated for us to meet."<p>Ranma's expression grew somber, "I've seen what my past lives have been like, I was lonely through out them all. There was not one life that I found contention in. This was the first existance that I had where I actually found love." He smirked again, "I guess my ego couldn't be content with anything less than Death itself."<p>"Death? What do you..." Cologne paused, and slowly turned a wide eyed stare towards Akane, who was now smirking herself.<p>"No..." Cologne took a step back, this really did cause a problem with their well made plans.<p>"Kind of Ironic that Saffron 'killed' the Grim Reaper himself... er, herself," Ranma blushed at having to correct himself, "And with her mortal demise, she returned back to the way she once was. She remembered all her mortal experiences, but unfortunately could not recover the sense of emotions. It was something inherit in her nature, I guess, and it was something she wanted back."<p>"I presume this was about when you orchestrated your own demise," Cologne stated.<p>"You mean committed suicide, do not try to cleverly word it, I know what you are trying to do." Ranma warned, "I wanted to die, without her, I felt all those millenia of loneliness slam upon me at once. Such a feeling you could not possibly comprehend. There are no Hells in existance that could match what I went through. You think I went insane because of Akane's death? I went insane from the lack of her presence."<p>"But why this? Why kill trillions for Death itself?" Cologne asked, "Is this some sort of sick gift to her? Were you a neilist that we should have put down before you were even birthed?"<p>"When I was reunited with Akane, I thought I would be happy again," Ranma started again, ignoring the emotion that was creeping into Cologne's voice, "She responded to me, but without emotion, I was just as lonely as before my death. I WOULD not suffer eternity with my love, and without her love. Akane told me that it was a law of the universe, something that was brought on by the need for balance. Death is to be remorseless by its nature, and as long as it proceeds at its standard pace, it would remain so. But... if death were to have the scales tipped tremendously in her favor, balance would have to be imposed. Death the aspect would be brought closer to what you consider godhood, instead of a fundamental force. Meaning she would be that much closer to mortality, and therefore, have the ability to love me back."<p>"Ranma, is she the one who told you such rubbish?" Cologne gave a look of distain towards Akane, "Listen, she's using you for her own ends. Return everything as it was, nobody even has to remember all this. You can atone for your mistakes. It is well within your power."<p>Ranma shook his head, "No, I'm afraid I can't do that."<p>"Can't? Or won't?"<p>"Does it matter?"<p>"Then why didn't you just grant her emotions with your newfound might?"<p>"And send the universe into chaos by doing so? There's a reason far beyond your comprehension as to why I cannot do that. The universe is a delicate thing, and to rearranged such on a mass scale is not a smart thing to do."<p>"Then, we will fight you, even if it is nothing but to our deaths."<p>"I owe you at least a... vent, and I shall be fair," Ranma replied, gaining a raised eyebrow from both Cologne and Akane.<p>"And how do you intend to do that? You *are* the ruler of all creation. I'm afraid we are just leading ourselve to slaughter for a ritious cause that is far beyond futile. And you even admit you are in the wrong."<p>"I... how do you figure?" Ranma asked, curiously.<p>"You know you do not deserve this power for your actions, yet you insist on flaunting it before us like a tyrant. I had thought one I came to love as my own blood would be better than that."<p>Ranma, as Cologne had hoped, became indignant, "You know I'll keep my word on this, you old Ghoul!"<p>Cologne ignored the comment, too much was at stake now for her to show irritation, "And how do you intend to do that?"<p>"Step out of the barrier," Ranma commanded. Cologne nodded, and backed up until she found herself against an old man with glasses and a powerful blue haired woman who were looking towards her curiously. Behind them, Ukyo stood.<p>"LISTEN UP!" Ranma shouted; everyone had heard him speak somehow, "YOU WILL NOT BE FACING YOUR GOD..." Ranma held his fist up, and the ring on his finger flashed. Those that were pressing against the barrier fell forward.<p>"YOU WILL FACE RANMA SAOTOME OF THE ANYTHING GOES SCHOOL OF MARTIAL ARTS!" He shouted with his own voice.<p>And all Hell broke loose.
