</div>Mr Yanagawa visited the fathers at the Tendo's to "report" his findings. "Your son has been acting peculiar, but at this stage, it is unclear if it is a minor stress-related episode, or if he has completely slipped into a delusional mania. If he's just sufferring from a stress-related breakdown, then he should recover quickly. However, if he doesn't recover quickly, he can be certified."<p>Mr. Saotome asked "Well then, what should we do?"<p>"You needn't do anything. We've gotten him readmitted to school, and gotten him a private room in a clinic where a doctor will continue to observe and treat him."<p>Mr. Tendo interrupts, "There's no need for that. He can stay here."<p>Mr. Yanagawa answers, "It is kind of you to offer, but I'm afraid that's impossible. My understanding is that many of the fights he winds up in originate here."<p>"Those are just training matches and challenges."<p>"Oh he'll still be available for those. Mr. Tendo, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but your youngest daughter has been repeatedly seen chasing after Ranma, and beating him up when she catches up with him. This afternoon, she'll be receiving a court injunction forbidding her from fighting Ranma, except during a proper challenge delivered the day before, or during a training match inside of a dojo, under observation."<p>Soun chuckles nervously, "Surely, there's no need to bring the courts into this, those are just little lover's quarrels."<p>"Not for a martial artist of her caliber. The court injunction is needed so Ranma doesn't have to prosecute her. If she violates the injunction, then she is committing a crime against the state, and not against Ranma. Apparently he has always refused to do anything to stop or constrain her, so she feels it is her right to do so. But since Ranma is now under the protection of the state while we determine his mental stability, it is necessary that we can protect Ranma without making him stand trial against Akane. That is, of course, only if she tries to beat up Ranma."<p>"But to take legal action against my daughter..."<p>"Oh no. No legal action will be taken at this point. She'll just receive a document warning her that attacking her fiancee physically is a prosecutable offence whether Ranma objects or not. We'll also have notices for Ryouga Hibiki and Happosai. Neither of them have fixed abodes, but have been known to frequent this house. if you could tell us when they are here, we'll quietly deliver their injunctions also."<p>-<p>The next morning, Ranma arrives at school well before Akane, and meets Ukyou in their classroom. "Morning, Ranma, where's Akane?"<p>"She should be here shortly. Out of sorts, and in a rage, I imagine. I gave her a second set of parents to go with her second childhood. Hadn't you noticed that she's worn out her first set?"<p>"Did something happen to mister Tendo?"<p>"Nothing sudden, or immediate. Over time, he's lost his spine, his heart, his mind, and his guts. His spleen and liver try to compensate, but even he doesn't drink enough to manage."<p>At this point, Akane walks in waving an official document, "Ranma, what is this!"<p>"Hard as it is to read as you wave it around, I imagine it's a letter from the court. I'm under the protection of the Emperor. If it bothers you, you might find him at the palace."<p>Ukyou interrupts "Akane, what's going on?"<p>"I got a letter from the courts telling me that attacking Ranma is grounds for arrest, even if he doesn't press charges! You mean, you didn't get one?"<p>"Why should she have gotten one? The only time she directed her rage at me, she thought I had dishonored her. I could never hold that against her." Ranma turns toward Ukyou, When we find the thief who stole your dowery in my name, I promise you my full help getting him to the altar for you."<p>"Wha, what are you talking about?"<p>"To restore your honor. I hear you decided to let him live, so when we find him next, I'll help you tie him up, stuff him into a kimono, makeup his face, and help you marry her. I believe the bride's name is Genma."<p>They are interrupted by the arrival of Hinako-sensei. During the taking of attendance, Hinako faces Ranma and says "I see you're back, Ranma."<p>"Just for the education, sensei. My opinions haven't changed."<p>"How did you manage to get permission to return here without my aproval?"<p>"Simple. Akane's father regards me as insane, in spite of the fact that I'm his ideal son in law. Therefor it falls upon the state to judge my situation. I'm under the indirect protection of the Emperor of Japan. Perhaps I'll swear allegiance to him."<p>"Do you still deny that you fall under Japanese law?"<p>"At the moment, I deny nothing, except other people's right to attack me. The courts have provisionally found in my favor."<p>"Still, you'll do as I say in my classroom."<p>"In the finest tradition of the samurai, I'll act as I think appropriate. You may either report my behavior to my lord for him to punish, or you may try to punish me directly, and face his displeasure. Considering my lord, the state, is your lord's lord, you should differ to me outside the classroom, but in respect of your teaching, I shall refer to you as sensei."<p>"You'll obey me, or you'll be punished."<p>"You'll refrain from punishing me, because you might lose your teaching licence. Without your licence you'd have to begin a new career from scratch."<p>"How dare you talk back to your teacher!"<p>"You asked for an explanation. I'm responding at your request. Your only options here are to drop this pointless argument, or punish me, and accept your own, more severe punishment. Of course, you could also commit seppuku to shame the courts for treating you unfairly.<p>-<p>That afternoon, the principal calls a general assembly for the whole school. "Aloha, keiki! Big new surprise for all you! Too much excitement from dating and fiancees are keeping my students from learning. Therefor:<p>o/ I decree in words succinct o/<p>o/ All who flirted, leered, or winked o/<p>o/ Unless connubially linked o/<p>o/ Shall forthwith be beheaded. o/<p>Anyone who dates, or is engaged gets one of my special haircuts. The PTA insisted however that married couples are exempt." and with his speach completed, a trap door opens beneath the principal, and wisks him to safety.<p>Akane and Ukyou confront Ranma, surrounded by a huge ring of concerned classmates. Ukyou asks Ranma, "What are we going to do now?"<p>"Well, I'd gather up all of the students who want to date, or are engaged, and decide either to give up, or pound the principal into pate."<p>"What do you mean 'You'd gather up?' Aren't you going to help?"<p>"No point, really. The local police know I'm exempt, as does the principal, even if he tries to ignore it. So it only affects me if I wanted to date, or be engaged to someone in the school." he turns to Akane "However, If I do adopt you, I promise to join the PTA, and get him kicked out of the school."<p>Akane barely restrains her rage. "But you're engaged to me!"<p>Ranma looks at her sadly, "If you're going to propose to me, I wish you did it in private. I'm too young to get married now, especially as we haven't formally dated. If you wish to join our families together, I'd suggest proposing to my father. He's never seen anything wrong with the idea of polygamy in the past." Before Akane can build up a head of steam, Ranma ducks out of the circle of students and heads back to class, just as Kuno charges in.<p>"Akane, my love, we must defeat the foul principal who sullies the name of Kuno lest the two of us should have to forsake each other's company, or forsake our glorious visages!"<p>Kuno gets punched through the roof.<p>-<p>That afternoon, Ranma stops off at the Tendos to pick up his pack, and some clothes. On his way out of the house, he's nearly knocked over by a hysterical pair of fathers. "Ranma, how dare you have my daughter served a restraining order!"<p>"I've done no such thing! As long as I've lived here, I've kept her psychopathic tendencies from the eyes of the state. You! Her own father, called in the government to look into this household! Her own father took the first step in getting his daughter thrown in prison."<p>Soun's wailing makes him incoherent, but Genma dives in to renew the parent's attack. "Don't try to twist this around so that this is our fault, boy!"<p>"You must be Soun's solicitor, or you'd be smart enough to keep your paws out of this affair. Well, you'd better get to court, but I doubt that you can get this overturned. You'd need to make up evidence that I beat up Akane, and even then, the best you'd probably get would be a restraining order on me, and you don't need that, because I've never assaulted her before. Why would I attack her, when there are so many more deserving people to assault?"<p>"Son, I want you to tell the courts that the restraining order isn't necessary."<p>"Actually, I think more restraining orders are necessary. Now that I'm no longer Soun's prisoner and hostage, there's no reason for me to restrain myself from seeking revenge. Perhapse I should challenge, and defeat his dojo. I wonder if the Tendo school could even survive having it's sensei defeated by an unranked student of another school."<p>"You wouldn't!"<p>"I can. I might. Then again, every time Happosai attacks me from now on will be another black mark for the Tendo school, And you know that if he isn't attacking me, he'll want to train with you. Unless you sell off one of your daughters to him for his perversions. If he's smart, he'll demand a daughter for each of you. Probably Akane to train as his heir, and Kasumi to fondle. Unless, of course, you think you can defeat the master?"<p>"How could you do this to us?"<p>"I haven't done anything yet. I've just stopped protecting you. Since I first showed up, I protected the Tendos, and the Tendos have abused me. Now you're whining about the fact that it's over. By the way, Genma, I hear your wife is looking for her daughter. Surely you realize that the courts will probably notify her. Call me, when you return from the training trip you plan to take next time Soun stops watching you."<p>"Genma, how dare you abandon me at a time like this?"<p>That evening, Nodoka enters the hospital where Ranma is staying. At the reception desk a young lady asks her "May I help you?"<p>"Yes, I'm here to see my son, Ranma Saotome."<p>After calling up his records, she apologizes. I'm sorry, but he's specifically requested not to have guests from either the Saotome family, or the Tendos. There's a note mentioning that he's estranged from his father."<p>"But I'm his mother! Surely I can see him."<p>"Not with a note in his file explicitly excluding you. His doctor could override it for you, but he's off duty at the moment. The on duty Doctor can have him paged if it is an emergency. He's listed as being with a patient, but I can have him come down after he finishes."<p>"Can I call Ranma to come down and let me in?"<p>"I'm sorry, but he doesn't have a phone. It seems he's been suffering harassment, so all communications are being screened by the doctors."<p>"Please page the doctor, I'll wait."<p>-<p>A grim faced doctor enters the waiting room, and walks up to Nodoka. "Nodoka Saotome?"<p>Nodoka is a bit taken aback by the lack of honorifics of any type. "Yes, and you are?"<p>"I'm the on duty Doctor."<p>The doctor didn't even bother to give his name. Nodoka frowns "I'd like to see my son, Ranma Saotome."<p>According to his doctor, he's not to be disturbed by his family. I can have his doctor paged, if it is an emergency."<p>"Would you, please."<p>"You'll have to convince me that it is an emergency."<p>"I haven't seen him in ten years!"<p>"Then it couldn't possibly be an emergency. I can not justify waking his doctor for this, and I cannot override his doctor's orders to admit family, especially in a case involving child abuse, and abandonment. If you want to see him, you can leave a message for him, or you can go see his caseworker, Mr. Yanagawa.<p>-<p>The next morning, Hinako enters her classroom. "I'm sorry to announce that I must ask everyone in the room who is going out with, or engaged to anyone to stand up."<p>About a third of the class stands up, including Ukyou and a pissed off Akane. Ranma, noticeably, is still seated. Hiroshi, seated behind him whispers "If anyone has to stand up, Ranma, you do."<p>Hinako says "Ranma, I asked you to stand up."<p>"I have never proposed. I have never accepted a proposal, or a dowery. I haven't asked anyone out, nor have I accepted anyone's offer for a date. I have no family that might otherwise entangle me. I'm a model student, wouldn't you say?"<p>"You're a delinquent! You get into fights!"<p>"The day I started school here, I was attacked by an upperclassman for speaking to Akane Tendo. The school has done nothing about this, since the upperclassman is your boss's son. I claim self-defence."<p>"You start fights all the time!"<p>"Can anyone in this room besides our teacher remember one time I attacked them? Have I ever started a physical fight with anyone here."<p>Akane yells "You start fights with me all the time!"<p>"Oh really? When did I ever attack you? You yell at me regularly for not attacking you when we spar!"<p>"You insult me all the time!"<p>"The first insult was from you. The day we met, you called me a pervert."<p>"You are a pervert!"<p>"Once again, you made the first insult in this discussion. I assume you remember that you have been forbidden to attack me without making a challenge a day in advance."<p>"Ranma, you jerk!"<p>"There. sorry teacher, but Akane always needs to call me both a jerk and a pervert. I assume she's gotten it out of her system."<p>Hinako tries to regain control of the classroom. "Anyway, according to principal Kuno, I have to ask all of you standing to either break up, or go to the Auditorium for a haircut."<p>Akane turns to Ukyou. "Come on, we've got to go beat up the principal again."<p>-<p>As Nodoka walks through the small archway, inside the government building, a high pitched beeping occurs. A guard walks up to her, and says "I'm sorry ma'am, but you've set off the metal detector. Please place your belongings on the conveyer belt, and try entering again."<p>"I never let this out of my sight."<p>"All right ma'am, but before you enter, we'll have to xray your package, and then use a portable metal detector, used by a female officer to prove that your bundle is the only metal object that we're detecting. You won't have to let it out of your sight, and no one but you need touch it. Is that satisfactory?"<p>"Thank you for being so understanding."<p>"Not at all. We have to operate under the instructions we've been given to guard the people in this building, but our job is also to make the experiences of our patrons as easy as we can. Please come this way so that this may be done privately."<p>-<p>Akane and Ukyou re-enter their homeroom with shellshocked expressions. Akane gasps out "There's an active volcano in the gym. We had to defeat the entire St. Chuck school of hairdressing's martial-arts-ukelele team. I'm sick of bananas."<p>-<p>Nodoka places the long oblong package on the rubberized surface of the Xray machine, as the guard looks at the Xray. "Ma'am?" the guard asks, while pressing a concealed button on the machine, "Why are you bringing a katana into a government building?"<p>"It is the Saotome Honor Sword. I carry it with me always."<p>"I'm afraid I have to ask you to speak to my supervisor. I really don't know what I'm to do in this situation. I'm forbidden to allow anyone to enter this building carrying a weapon, even a cerimonial one."<p>"Oh, it isn't cerimonial. I keep it in excellent repair, and I'm a 2nd dan at Iajutsu."<p>"Ma'am, that's even more awkward. I'm afraid it has been illegal to carry a concealed weapon in public, since the war."<p>"But I was told I couldn't carry it openly in public."<p>"Yes ma'am, carring it openly has been illegal since the Meiji Restoration. We still have people in the police trained to disarm samurai, although now they are usually used to subdue drunk salarymen who have gotten ahold of something sharp, and half of their training is in getting the item out of their hands without letting the drunk injure himself." The door opens, and a distinguished man wearing a suit enters. The guard looks relieved. "Please take your sword, and go talk with detective Hiyama-san. He will decide what should be done."<p>-<p>Kuno charges into Akane's classroom. "Akane, my love, come with me to my family's onsen where we can wash the pulped bananas out of each other's hair!"<p>Akane's mallet connects with Kuno's ribs, and propells him out the window. Akane turns to the teacher, "Sorry for the interruption, sensei."<p>-<p>Later that day, Nodoka sits down across from Mr. Yanagawa. "I'm having some difficulties in seeing my son. I'm told you could help me."<p>"First, I'd better explain the situation to you. A few days ago, Genma Saotome and Soun Tendo contacted our department, because they claimed that Ranma Saotome was non compos mentis. However we found that he was just dealing with an incredible amount of stress, child abuse, physical abuse, and repeated abandonment. He disowned his father, a situation that Genma Saotome has ignored.<p>"He grew up with a father that frequently made him an accomplice to petty theft. This father told him that you'd died. I know you really are his mother, but Ranma has just disowned the only parent he's ever known, and finds it odd that his mother suddenly appears. Especially as you've never been there when he needed you, and appear when he no longer needs anyone."<p>"But I didn't know he needed me. I had a formal agreement with my husband to raise our son appropriately. I couldn't abridge that agreement."<p>"Quite. To do so would be tantamount to admitting that your husband was incompetent to raise a child. Instead he's proved it repeatedly, and will probably have to go to court to defend himself from an accusation of criminal negligence. You probably couldn't be accused for anything but being an unwitting accomplice, and abandoning him at an early age. The important question is what did you know of your husband's nature when you let Ranma go with him. Ranma believes you knew what sort of person he was, and is therefor not anxious to see you. Part of his reluctance is no doubt due to his father keeping him from females all his life. He doesn't know how to deal with you."<p>"But I'm his mother!"<p>"And his rejection of the only parent he's ever known,is grounds to consider that he's rejecting both his parents."<p>"You keep saying Genma is the only parent he's known, but I raised him until he was six."<p>"And he vaguely remembers you, as his mother who died when he was young. Many children in his situation feel anger and hate to some extent toword the parent that died on them. To find out later that he suffered that for nothing, and that your absense wasn't beyond your control, ... it's quite understandable that he's reluctant to meet with you."<p>"But I'm still his mother! It's my right to see him!"<p>"You have no rights to see your abused child! He is now a ward of the state. As such, it is his right to permit or deny visitors, until the extent of the criminal abuse he has received has been determined, and his case goes before a magistrate. We protect victims of domestic violence, and it has been repeatedly determined that even uninvolved family members use guilt and other types of pressure to bear on the victim to put themselves back in danger."<p>"I'd never do that!"<p>"You'd probably like him to live at your home. Are the Tendos or Genma Saotome welcome in your house?"<p>"I couldn't lock out my own husband."<p>"Therefor he'd be in danger again. I can see that he gets any messages you want to send him, but they must be written, so that if it becomes necessary, they can be entered as evidence."<p>"I can't believe you wont let me see him."<p>"I'm charged with defending a man who no one has bothered to defend. Just because he's capable of leveling this building, does not mean that he can protect himself from his family and so-called friends. You gave up your rights to see him when you let him go when he was six. It is now his choice whether he wants to return to you, not yours."<p>-<p>Soun waits for Ranma to leave school grounds. Before Ranma can leave, Soun bellows, "You will marry Akane, and that's final. Honor demands it!"<p>Ranma replies "Honor is as heavy as a mountain, death is as light as a feather. You know I can't marry while the other engagements are outstanding. But I do have a plan to solve this. I'd need your help though."<p>"Anything to help you marry Akane."<p>"First, we steel-clad the dojo. Then we invite all the fiancees, and their relatives and my father to a meeting to settle this. Add a dozen swords, cut the lights, and I lock you all in from the outside. I leave you there until all of the other fiancees are dead."<p>"Th-that's horrendous!" Soun bursts into tears.<p>Ranma goes over to comfort him. This is perfect for you. You get to defend the engagement with my father's and your life. Plus you are guaranteed to never see me marry anyone else. I know, I'll hedge my bet, by mining the floor with explosives. After the fight, I can end my last engagement and the dojo-dowery at the same time."<p>-<p>-<p>Author's notes: Please review, I crave feedback.
