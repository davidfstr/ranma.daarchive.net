</div><p>A  Mother's Tale</p><p>by  Alex Tomas</p><p>This  is my first work of fan fiction. Reviews welcome.</p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>I  do not own the Ranma characters.</p><p>Conventions:</p><p>"  " - Japanese</p><p>{  } - foreign language (Chinese, English)</p><p>[  ] - sound effects</p><p>- thoughts</p><p>#  # - signs</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This  happens during season 7 episode 143, Ranma Meets Mother Boy Meets  Mom, Part I in the television series or volume 22 chapter 2 of the  manga. It takes elements from both the anime and the manga.</p><p>Ranma's  mother, Nodoka Saotome, on her way for the first time to the Tendo  Dojo sees male-type Ranma fall into the storm drain and transform  into girl-type Ranma. Ranma stutters some excuse but Nodoka waves it  off as she is in a hurry and proceeds to the the Tendo Dojo without  giving out each other's names.</p><p>I  am assuming that Nodoka does not know the Tendos and has no knowledge  of the honor contract Genma and Soun entered into to unite their two  families. My reason is that if Genma  informed her then she would know the Tendos and vice-versa.</p><p>Chapter  2: Mommy! Mommy Changes Everything.</p><p>After  walking for almost an hour Ranma was about to ask his mother where  their house was when Nodoka finally stopped at the gates of a modest  home in a neighboring ward of Tokyo. It was typical of modern  Japanese two-story homes with a concrete  wall surrounding it. She opened the gate and ushered in her family.</p><p>"Welcome  home, son." Genma didn't miss the point he wasn't included. He  still decided to risk asking a question.</p><p>"Uh,  dear, honey, love?"</p><p>Ranma  almost gagged.</p><p>"Yes,  husband?"</p><p>"Whose  house is this? This isn't the house that I remember we lived in."  Genma scratched his head as he looked at the nice house, very much  nicer than he remembered. Bigger also.</p><p>"Oh,  I sold our old house several months ago just after I received your  last postcard and bought this new one. I think the new owners tore  the old one down already. I think this one is much nicer."  Nodoka replied casually. (1)</p><p>"Oh."  Genma said. He obviously wanted to ask more questions but he didn't  want to push his luck too much. Genma's eyes widened as they enter  the house. I wonder where she got the money to buy all these?  It was sparsely appointed with modern household appliances but to  Genma it was luxuriously equipped compared to their old home. Genma  caught himself calculating how much he could sell the stuff, yen  signs appearing in his eyes. He shook his head. Genma, it's not  worth losing your life over. He looked closer anyway, greed  overcoming his survival instincts for the moment and was surprised to  see something engraved on every piece of furniture and appliance.</p><p>#Saotome  Family Property. Not For Sale, Pawn Or Trade.#</p><p>Genma  winced and the yen signs disappeared.</p><p>Nodoka  smirked inwardly as she saw Genma's reactions. Surprised at how  well your wife did, husband? She decided to let him stew for some  time. She was not going to volunteer information unless he asked.  Even then she'd be careful in what she said to him. She looked at her  son.</p><p>"How  do you like your new home, Ranma?"</p><p>"It's  okay, I guess. Mom, you live here all by yerself?" Ranma looked  around. The house looked a little too big for someone living alone.</p><p>"Yes  but now that you're home I don't have to live alone anymore."  Nodoka replied happily. "We'll be one big happy family again."  She hugged her son. "Here let me show you to your room."</p><p>Ranma  even has his own room? Genma was getting more curious by the  minute. He followed his wife and son. Nodoka led them up the stairs  to one of the doors. She opened the door to reveal a room that was  somewhat smaller than the guest room Ranma  and Genma shared at the Tendo home. It was furnished with a single  bed with a mattress, a small table with a lamp, a study table, two  chairs and a cabinet. She went to the middle of the room and waited  until Ranma stood beside her. She faced him.</p><p>"I've  been waiting for the day you would use this room, Ranma. I've been  cleaning it every day in the hope it would be the day you finally  came home." Nodoka was on the verge of tears. "Ranma,  I've missed you so much!" She hugged Ranma tightly. Sobs began.</p><p>"Mo-mom!"  Ranma hugged back hesitantly. "Mom, don't cry. I'm home now.  Every thing's gonna be alright from now  on." He tried to sound reassuring. Genma simply shuffled  uncomfortably at the doorway.</p><p>"Do  you promise? Do you promise your mother everything's  going to be alright from now on?" Nodoka was sounding  desperate, ten years of separation from her child can do that to a  mother. She looked up into his eyes with her tear-streaked ones.</p><p>Ranma  swallowed, realizing the enormity of the promise he was about to  make. He firmed his resolve and his voice. He straightened his back  and looked his mother in her eyes.</p><p>"I  promise, mom."</p><p>"Thank  you, my son." Nodoka wiped her eyes. "Oh, dear. I must  look terrible right now." She smiled radiantly.</p><p>"Aw,  mom, ya can't ever look terrible to me."</p><p>Nodoka  smiled, blushed and fluttered her eyelids. "Oh, my! No wonder  so many girls are after you! You say the nicest things!"</p><p>Ranma  panicked and began backing away while waving his arms. "Um, ah,  uh, I..." He stammered.</p><p>"Oh,  my. You look so cute when you do that." His mother teased  mercilessly. Ranma began to blush furiously.</p><p>"gggrrruuurrrgggllleee..."</p><p>"Oh,  well. I'll leave you to settle yourself in. I'll prepare the furo so  you and your father can clean up before dinner." Nodoka exited  and led her husband to their bedroom leaving Ranma to get his brain  back into gear. After a few seconds he shook his head.</p><p>Women!  I'll never figure them out.</p><p>He  unpacked his few belongings and put them away in the cabinet. He sat  down on one of the chairs.</p><p>Home.  I'm finally home.</p><p>After  a quarter of an hour inspecting his new room Ranma went out to look  for his mother. He found her in the kitchen preparing tea and some  crackers.</p><p>"Hi,  mom. Need any help?"</p><p>"Oh,  thank you dear but I'm fine. I'm happy to be finally able to do this  for my family again. The bath will be ready in another fifteen  minutes." She indicated the kitchen table and chairs. "Why  don't we have tea while you wait. We really haven't had a chance to  talk."</p><p>"Okay,  mom. Um, where's pops?"</p><p>"I  left him upstairs to unpack. He should be finished by now."</p><p>"Um,  so watcha wanna talk about, mom?"</p><p>"Well,  why don't we start with the way you speak?"</p><p>"Er,  anything wrong with the way I talk, mom?"</p><p>"For  one, your grammar leaves much to be desired."</p><p>"Uh,  what's 'grammar'?"</p><p>"Let's  add vocabulary to the list."</p><p>"Mom,  I dunno what yer talkin' about."</p><p>Nodoka  sighed deeply.</p><p>"I  take it your father didn't put too much significance in your  education while on your training trip?"</p><p>"Uh,  well, we didn't stay in one place long and the few times I did went  to school its been nothing but trouble. Besides the teachers are  boring and I don't see how what they teach in school's gonna help me  become the best." Although I'm the best there is already!  "And pop didn't want nothing to interfere with my training."</p><p>"I  see, is there anything else your father neglected in your training  journey?"</p><p>"Well,  I dunno. I think I turned out okay. Doncha think so, mom?"</p><p>Nodoka  sighed deeply again.</p><p>"Perhaps  it would be best for me to observe you for several days to see  whatever deficiencies you may have."</p><p>Ranma  wasn't sure he understood correctly and simply shrugged. "Ah,  whatever ya say, mom."</p><p>His  father chose that moment to make his entrance. He had just made a  tour of the house and what he saw astonished him. He had an awed look  to his face and seemed oblivious to his surroundings.</p><p>"Is  something the matter, dear?"</p><p>"Wha?  Wha?" The shock hadn't worn off yet.</p><p>"Hey,  pops! Mom asked ya a question."</p><p>[Bonk!]</p><p>Genma  blinked and looked around to get his bearings. He rushed to Nodoka  startling her.</p><p>"Nodoka,  where, how, when, why?" He had so many questions to ask they all  came out in a rush.</p><p>[BONK!]  Ranma hit his pop harder on the head.</p><p>"Pop,  cut it out! Yer scaring mom!"</p><p>Genma  composed himself as best as he could.</p><p>"Nodoka,  how did you get all of these?" Genma indicated his  surroundings. "Where did you get the money?"</p><p>"Well,  dearest, when you left me all alone ten years ago you didn't leave me  much. I had to find work to support myself and pay all the bills or  else I would have been thrown out on the street."</p><p>Genma  looked doubtful. He couldn't think of any job that would have paid  that much for Nodoka to do this well. He wanted to ask more questions  but the look she gave him said she wouldn't tell him more.</p><p>Oh,  well. I have other ways of knowing.</p><p>Ranma  was angry. He couldn't believe his pop would leave his mother just  like that without any means of supporting herself. He wanted to beat  the crap out of him but he didn't want to spoil his reunion with his  mother and damage the house she obviously worked so hard for.</p><p>"Uh,  mom, what job did you do?"</p><p>That's  my boy!</p><p>"Well,  a friend from college hired me to teach nursery at the school her  family runs. She's such a good friend and I enjoyed teaching the  students. They were your age when you left. It helped ease the pain a  little." Nodoka smiled at the recollection.</p><p>Genma  squinted. I didn't know teachers made that much money.</p><p>Ranma  gulped. Not another teacher! "So how long did you  teach, mom?"</p><p>"Oh,  I stopped about a year and a half ago so I taught for almost nine  years. By then I had saved enough money to concentrate searching for  you. The money is with another college friend who is a stock-broker.  He's such a dear and very smart. He's been able to do wonderful  things with the money I saved so that we won't go hungry..."</p><p>Genma's  eyes glinted, yen signs reappearing. Money! And lots of it!  He schooled his features lest he gave away his thoughts. Nodoka  feigned indifference.</p><p>"...although  I expect husband dear to get a job as is proper for a Japanese male."</p><p>Genma  sagged. Get a job? What for? You just said we've got enough  money! He was already calling the money theirs. Out loud he said.  "Oh, sure, honey. First thing tomorrow, I'll go look for work."</p><p>Nodoka  wasn't fooled for a moment. "Husband, if you want to drink  sake, go out with Soun or just make a fool of yourself you will have  to spend your own money. The money I have saved is for our  necessities. Do I make myself clear?"</p><p>"Yes,  honey, very clear." Soon, very soon. Wait for me, my  precious.</p><p>Nodoka  looked at him and sighed. Sometimes she wondered what she ever saw in  him.</p><p>"The  bath must be ready by now. Why don't you two freshen up while I  prepare dinner. Anything you want, Ranma?"</p><p>"Um,  anything's fine, mom. Just make enough for the three of us."</p><p>"Oh,  alright dear. Now go on and take a bath."</p><p>Nodoka  surprised father and son by cooking sukiyaki for her family. Ranma  and Genma were further surprised by the generous amount Nodoka  prepared. They each had more than enough to satisfy their respective  Saotome male stomachs. It was another thing for Genma to wonder  about. He also began to doubt the wisdom of his decision to stay at  the Tendo Dojo. He could have been eating like this a long time ago!  If he survived the homecoming, he corrected.</p><p>After  dinner Ranma helped his mom clean up the dishes while his father  stayed in the living room watching television.</p><p>Ranma  was about to go upstairs to sleep so that he could wake up early the  next day when Nodoka called out to him.</p><p>"Ranma,  can you stay for a while? There is something we must discuss."  She took a seat at the kitchen table.</p><p>Ranma  was immediately on guard. The tone of his mother's voice told him to  be careful. Genma also took the hint and made himself scarce. It  seemed too nice a night to waste lounging around a katana wielding  wife.</p><p>"Um,  what about mom?"</p><p>"Please  take a seat, son." Nodoka waited until Ranma had seated  himself. "It is about your engagements and the girls."</p><p>Ranma  winced. He was right. It was something he had to be careful about.</p><p>"Uh,  can't we talk about this some other time, mom?"</p><p>"Unfortunately  no, Ranma. If it is something that only involved you then I would not  mind postponing the discussion." Ranma sighed. His mom was  right.</p><p>"So  what about them, mom?"</p><p>"How  do you feel about the engagements and the girls?"</p><p>Ranma  blinked. That's a new one. "How do I feel about them?" He  asked just to be sure he heard right. He'd never been asked how he  felt before.</p><p>"Yes.  How do you feel about them. They have all been thrust upon you  without your consent."</p><p>"I  guessed they have, haven't they?"</p><p>Nodoka  smiled "You do know that you are living one of the wildest  fantasies known to man, do you not?"</p><p>Ranma  snorted, thinking of the countless times Hiroshi and Daisuke reminded  him of that fact. Hah! I'd like to hear them say that after they  spend one day living my life. Ranma blanched as he reconsidered  what he just said. On second thought, they're perverted enough to  actually enjoy the experience. He shuddered as he thought what  the two perverts would do with Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo, even Kodachi.  He quickly banished the thought.</p><p>"I  take it you are not exactly happy with the situation?"</p><p>Ranma  sighed again. "Don't get me wrong, mom. I do know I'm living  'one of the wildest fantasies known to man' as ya put it. Under  different circumstances I'd probably be overjoyed. But I just don't  know what to do about it. It seems no matter what I do someone's  gonna get hurt."</p><p>"So  it is not the engagements or the girls themselves that you are  unhappy about?"</p><p>"Well,  the girls could lay off a little. And I could do without all their  nutcase suitors that are coming after me."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Well,  ya can't exactly expect cute girls like Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo not  to have some suitors. Just my luck that those jerks think the only  way they can win the girls is by getting rid of me." Ranma went  on a little about Ryoga, Kuno, Mousse and Tsubasa.</p><p>"I  see. Do they cause you harm, my son?" Nodoka fingered her  katana.</p><p>"Them?  Hah! They couldn't touch me even with my eyes closed and both hands  tied behind my back! I'm the best!" Ranma puffed out his chest.</p><p>Nodoka  smiled at her son's bravado. If he wasn't in any immediate danger  then she can handle the jilted suitors later. She returned to the  subject beforehand.</p><p>"I  think the reason the girls act that aggressively towards you is  because they feel they are competing against each other for you."</p><p>Ranma  shrugged. "I guess so. Still it would be a load offa my back if  they'd lay off a little."</p><p>"Would  it help if I talked to them about it during the slumber party?"</p><p>Ranma  brightened. "Really mom? That'd be great!"</p><p>"So  aside from those two complaints, you are not totally unhappy about  the engagements and the girls?"</p><p>"Well,  I guess I could do worse than them." They were all cute (not  that he'll admit that to the uncute tomboy), sexy (again he wouldn't  admit that to the built-like-a-brick girl), smart (okay he'll admit  that one to Akane) and can cook (except for Akane although she was  getting better. The last time he ate one of the meals she prepared  was after the love-predicting cherry blossom cake incident and he was  shocked to find himself still conscious after how much he ate. Not  that he'll admit that also.)</p><p>Yep,  Ranma considered himself lucky to have such girls interested in him,  especially if he considered what he might have instead. The thought  of Shampoo losing the championship match to the other person Was  that... person really a girl? and he winding up being married  to... that person still gave him nightmares.</p><p>"And  if I were to find a way that would allow you to satisfy all your  engagements?"</p><p>"I  don't see how, mom."</p><p>"Humor  your mother, son."</p><p>"Heck,  I'd be happy if anyone could solve my girl problems including my  curse!" Ranma made an attempt at humor.</p><p>Nodoka  smiled at seeing her son's attempt at lightening the mood.</p><p>"Elder  Cologne did say that she and Shampoo wouldn't mind if you married  Shampoo by Amazon law only. That would enable you to marry another by  Japanese law. And since Ukyo is registered as a boy, we could adopt  your girl form so you can marry each other."</p><p>Ranma  thought about what her mother said. It was tempting. It would solve  _his_ fiancee problems. Then he shook his head.</p><p>"Mom  as tempting as it sounds it's just ain't right. Marrying Shampoo by  Amazon law may be fine if we were going to live back in her village  but we probably wouldn't. If I marry Shampoo and we stay here I want  her to be married properly to me by Japanese law. She deserves as  much. Same with Ucchan. If I marry Ucchan, I marry her as the woman  that she is and not some person she had to make up because of what  pops did to her. Besides that's the only way she'd regain the honor  that she lost."</p><p>Ranma  blinked. Where did that come from? I must be sick or something.</p><p>Nodoka  tried to hold back the tears of happiness at the overwhelming pride  she felt towards her son. My son is so manly!</p><p>"My  son! You make me so proud!"</p><p>"Huh?"  What brought this on? He noticed the watery eyes. "Mom,  don't cry. Whatever I said to make you cry, I take back. I'm sorry!"</p><p>[Sniff.  Sniff.]</p><p>"Oh,  Ranma. I'm not crying because I'm sad or angry. Quite the opposite."</p><p>"Oh.  Ya sure, mom?"</p><p>"Yes,  I'm sure. Thank you, Ranma, it has been a very enlightening  conversation. Now why don't you go to bed and let your mother think  for awhile. You have to be up early tomorrow for school."</p><p>"Okay,  mom." Ranma stood up and turned to leave. He paused as he  thought of something. Nodoka noted the hesitation.</p><p>"Is  there something more you wish to discuss, Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma  faced his mother. "Well..." He didn't know how to  continue.</p><p>Nodoka  gave a reassuring smile and reached over to squeeze Ranma's hand.</p><p>"Whatever  it is you can tell your mother, Ranma. I promise to listen."</p><p>Ranma  sat again and took courage from the smile and hand contact. "You  see, mom, there's another girl who's after me, obsessed is more like  it. A real nutcase. I don't want to hurt her feelings or anything but  I just can't see myself with her."</p><p>Another  girl? My son is so manly! Nodoka suppressed a giggle and tried  not to smile too much. Ooohhh, the number of grandchildren I will  have! "And who is this girl?"</p><p>"Her  name's Kodachi, Kodachi Kuno. She's the younger sister of that Kuno I  told you about. Their father's the principal at Furinkan. Another  nutcase. I tell ya, the whole family's nuts! They give me the  shivers."</p><p>"Really,  Ranma, how can you say they're 'nuts' as you put it?" Now  where did I hear the name Kuno before?</p><p>"For  starters, the father has a palm tree growing on his head, a fetish  for haircuts, goes out of his to annoy his students, wears these  weird clothes and plays that ukelele of his all day long. Then that  Kuno guy has this samurai-wanna-be fantasy, can't talk straight, has  this idiotic idea that I've enslaved Akane and his 'pig-tailed  goddess', won't believe that me and his 'pig-tailed goddess' are the  same person even when I changed right in front of him (I'll be damned  if I'll say while he was hugging me), that I'm some kind of evil  sorcerer who use dark magic to be able to beat him and that's just  what I can think of off the top of my head. As for Kodachi, she keeps  an alligator named 'Mr. Turtle' for a pet and wouldn't think twice of  feeding anyone to her pet, uses all sorts of potions/powder/whatever  against everyone including me, has a fetish for black roses and  leotards, cheats at everything, hates my girl form although I don't  think she knows we're the same person, and is such a snob."</p><p>"I  see." Nodoka continued to think of where and when she had heard  of the name Kuno.</p><p>"Uh,  mom, something wrong?" Ranma became concerned at the blank look  on his mother's face.</p><p>Nodoka  came to with a start. "Oh! I'm sorry, Ranma. I don't know what  came over me."</p><p>"Do  you need anything?"</p><p>"Oh,  Ranma, I'm fine. I was just trying to think of when and where I've  heard of the name Kuno before."</p><p>Ranma  blinked. "Ya know them?"</p><p>"No,  I don't really know them but I've heard of their family before."</p><p>"Well,  they are filthy rich."</p><p>Something  clicked in Nodoka's mind.</p><p>"Of  course! Now I remember where and when I heard of their family  before."</p><p>"Ya  do?"</p><p>"Yes  and I think I may know why the family acts the way they do today."</p><p>"Ya  do? Ain't the family just crazy because they're nuts?"</p><p>"No,  they did not always act the way they do today. In fact, the Kuno  family was one of the most respected families in Japan."</p><p>"Ya  gotta be kidding! Ya can't be serious, mom! Them? That Kuno  family?" Ranma had difficulty with the concept. If someone  told him the world was flat he would have found it easier to believe  in.</p><p>"But  I am, Ranma. Tell me, my son, how would you react if you saw your  mother or wife savagely gang-raped and then brutally murdered right  before your eyes?"</p><p>Ranma  blanched at the statement.</p><p>"Th-That  happened to them?" Ranma had difficulty imagining the horror.</p><p>"Sadly,  yes. It happened around eight years ago, it was all in the news. Some  criminals, at least half a dozen if I recall correctly and suspected  of being under orders from a business rival, probably a yakuza  member, of the father broke into their house. It was never found out  what the mastermind wanted but the father wasn't home because he was  at a business meeting. They subdued the servants, tied up the men and  raped the women. Then they rounded up Mrs. Kuno and her two children  in front of the servants in the living room. There they took turns  repeatedly raping Mrs. Kuno. Mrs. Kuno was killed when she tried to  protect her daughter from being sexually abused by the criminals. It  was while Mrs. Kuno lay dying that the father came home. In a blind  rage he killed all the criminals with his bare hands. After that the  family simply came apart. Mr. Kuno blamed himself and retreated from  the world and left his children to deal with the trauma on their  own." Nodoka recalled the news accounts vividly. It had enraged  the nation for a long time.</p><p>Ranma  was ready to throw up. It would explain a lot of things about the  Kuno family. He looked at his mother and shuddered violently.</p><p>"Terrible  isn't it? For something like that to happen to any family."</p><p>Ranma  nodded.</p><p>"Now  tell me about the Kodachi girl. What would you like me to do?"</p><p>"Um,  let... um, nuthin'... nuthin', mom. It ain't nuthin' important. I...  I'll see ya in the morning." Ranma quickly stood up and left  for his room. Ranma felt sick, even to his most hated enemy he would  not wish such a fate. He stumbled into bed and tried to keep images  of the horror from his mind.</p><p>Nodoka  watched her son leave. Such a kind heart you have, my son. I pray  it does not become your undoing. Nodoka made a note to find out  more about the Kuno family and Kodachi in particular. After a while  she stood and went to the bedroom she shared with Genma. It didn't  bother her that her husband wasn't around. Ranma was with her and all  was right in the world again.</p><p>Dinner  at the Tendo home was a subdued affair. The fact that they each had  bigger portions of the delicious meal Kasumi prepared did little to  brighten the mood. There was little conversation as each was lost in  his or her own thoughts on the departure of their long time house  guests. Even Soun did not have the energy to cry his usual amount of  tears.</p><p>Each  went their own way after eating. Soun sat at the porch smoking and  drinking sake while staring out at the koi pond, sighing loudly and  forlornly once in a while. The three sisters retired to their  respective rooms after clearing up the dishes. The Tendo home fell  into an eerie silence.</p><p>Akane  was lying in bed and having a totally miserable time. Sleep eluded  her. She had been tossing and turning for the last hour.</p><p>Where  can P-Chan be? I really need someone to talk to right now.</p><p>She  hated to admit it but she missed the jerk. She had felt hollow as she  watched Ranma leave and she regretted the way they had parted. She  hated him for making her feel this way and she hated herself for  feeling this way. The feeling was somewhat similar to what she felt  when her mother died. It made her angry.</p><p>She  didn't exactly know when she started caring for the obnoxious martial  artist just that it happened. God knows they had gotten off the wrong  foot. She smiled as she remembered the day they met.</p><p>'Built  better to boot.' Hah! She showed him!</p><p>She  sighed.</p><p>Life  was so much simpler back then.</p><p>Now  it's one craziness after another. She remembered all the times they  had shared, the good and the bad. At the end she had to admit the  good far outweighed the bad.</p><p>Her  thoughts wandered to the engagement.</p><p>Do  I really want to keep it?</p><p>Her  memories of the love predicting cherry blossom cake episode came  back. And she knew the answer. Yes, she wanted to keep it. God help  her but she wanted to keep it. Not that she'll admit it to anyone,  though. Especially to the jerk involved. His ego's big enough as it  is. But now that Auntie Saotome has recognized Ukyo's and Shampoo's  engagements she had to abide by a different set of rules regarding  her own engagement to Ranma. Especially now that he no longer lived  with them.</p><p>Do  I want to fight Ukyo and Shampoo for it?</p><p>She  realized she couldn't find a straight answer to the question. The  only thing she was sure of was that she didn't want to regret not  fighting for something she wanted. Yes, she decided, she'll fight  Ukyo and Shampoo.</p><p>How  do I go about that?</p><p>She  sighed as she compared herself to the two other girls. It just made  her so insecure. They were prettier, sexier and more talented than  her. How can she ever compete with those two? She burned with  jealousy mixed with despair as the thoughts continued. In frustration  she decided to have some milk to help her sleep.</p><p>Nabiki  lay in her bed and stared at the ceiling in her room. There was a  gnawing sensation inside her that she couldn't push away. It was the  same feeling she felt whenever she let a good deal slip away. And it  bothered her greatly.</p><p>She  didn't expect to be be so affected by the sudden departure of Ranma  and his father. After all, didn't she always complain of the added  burden those two imposed on their finances? She remembered the time  when they had barely anything to eat and Ranma tried to take in  students and revive the Dojo on his own initiative. She really  appreciated the effort, it was more than either father had tried. She  snickered at the recollection of Kodachi offering anything to Ranma  when she heard he was living in poverty. Too bad Ranma had to go all  noble and refuse all their requests. She could have had her CD player  by now! The idiot!</p><p>Heh!  Kodachi even came to live here and do housework! Imagine someone as  snobbish as the Black Rose doing laundry and cleaning floors like an  ordinary maid. She must have it really bad for Ranma. Wonder what she  sees in him?</p><p>Nabiki  realized it just wasn't Kodachi who was head over heels for Ranma. It  amused her no end to think of the time that Kodachi, Ukyo and Shampoo  had dropped everything to go with Ranma when they had thought Ranma's  mother had come to take him away.</p><p>What  do they all see in him?</p><p>They  were all beautiful, sexy, intelligent and talented girls who, despite  a quirk or two, could have almost any boy (or girl if they swung that  way) they wanted.</p><p>Am  I missing something here? Do they know something I don't?</p><p>Then  she remembered when she became the fiance. It was nothing but a lark  for her. Something to annoy her baby sister with. She blushed  slightly at the memory of those strong arms cradling her, of Ranma  protecting her from his other fiancees with his own body.</p><p>Nabiki  barked a short laugh at Ranma's pathetic revenge against her when he  realized she was playing him. She had actually been terrified that  she might have pushed Ranma's buttons one too many times. She should  have known better. He was just too kind-hearted for his own good.</p><p>She  stiffled a giggle at how easily she manipulated Ranma, of his  reactions whenever she turned on her feminine charms. The giggle died  when something struck her.</p><p>When  was the last time a boy was charmed by me?</p><p>Try  as hard as she could, Nabiki couldn't recall the last time it had  happened.</p><p>Was  there even a first time before Ranma?</p><p>She  couldn't recall either.</p><p>Ranma  had been the first boy who treated her as a girl and not as the 'Ice  Queen'.</p><p>Even  though he already knew of my reputation and despite all I put him  through.</p><p>It  was then a tear ran down Nabiki's cheek. She wiped it off with one  hand.</p><p>Where  did that come from?</p><p>It  had been a long time since Nabiki Tendo had shed a tear. She  remembered the day very clearly. She remembered the pain even  clearer. It was the day her mother died. The day she vowed never to  be hurt like that ever again. The day she became the 'Ice Queen'.</p><p>It  had worked, she was never hurt like that again, but it came at a  price.</p><p>Combine  the 'Ice Queen' facade with her money raising activities and you have  a person not many people are willing to be friends with.</p><p>Yet  Ranma actually believed me when I said I loved him. He panicked every  time I pretended to be hurt. He did everything I asked him to do to  please me. He tried to avoid hurting me. He really cared for me. What  did he ever see in me to make him do those things?</p><p>A  person. He saw something in me even I didn't see anymore. She  answered herself. Then blinked. Is that the reason why I have  this gnawing feeling in me? That I've let a good thing slip away?  Maybe the girls were onto something after all.</p><p>Will  I ever meet someone like him again? Someone who would see me as a  person?</p><p>Who  knows? Probably not.</p><p>Nabiki  frowned. She didn't like the emotions her thoughts were evoking. She  tried to suppress the thoughts and emotions but the gnawing sensation  persisted. It was unknown territory for her and she didn't like not  knowing. Besides he already has too many girls after him, her baby  sister even being one of the fiancees. She sighed as she knew she had  to settle this before she could go to sleep.</p><p>So  what if I never meet anyone like him again?</p><p>Do  I want take that chance and spend the rest of my life alone?</p><p>This  is getting nowhere.</p><p>Why  am I even thinking of this?</p><p>Because  he's suddenly gone and I have this empty feeling inside me.</p><p>Nabiki  shook her head angrily. Damn it! She's the Ice Queen! She's not  supposed to feel this way. She stood and paced restlessly in her  room. After several rounds she decided a midnight snack might help  clear her head.</p><p>Kasumi  lay on her side in her bed looking out of the window. She  contemplated the day's events. It was strange, she mused, how much  their lives had changed since the day Ranma and Uncle Genma had come  into their lives.</p><p>She  wouldn't admit it to anyone but she found it a refreshing change from  the dreariness her life had become. Nothing to relieve the  tediousness of the housework she had to do day after day. Not that  she didn't love doing the household chores. It was, after all, her  way of expressing her love for her family especially for her mother.  Its just that she sometimes wondered at what she had missed ever  since she had to take up the responsibilities her mother had left  behind.</p><p>In  the several months the Saotomes had been with them they had gone out  more times than in the several years since her mother passed away.  She had thoroughly enjoyed herself on those outings, either to the  beach, mountain, hot spring resort, local fair or amusement park. She  even had worked up the courage to wear a two-piece bikini the last  time they went to the beach (2) and she had been mobbed by the boys  for her effort. She sometimes wished she was able to accompany Ranma  and her sister on some of their adventures but her duties at home  prevented her from doing so.</p><p>Oh,  there were times when she found the chaos that seemed to follow the  younger Saotome everywhere distressing and she wished for the calm  before the two arrived but now that they were indeed gone she found  herself longing for the excitement the father and son brought into  her life. If dinner was any indication then the life of dreariness  has returned and returned with a vengeance as if making up for the  time it was gone. Her father was back to losing himself in self-pity  and would probably never go out, much less take his family out. That  meant she again had to stay home to take care of her father and the  house. She sighed. It was very likely she'd find her father drunk and  passed out on the porch in the morning. She hoped he wouldn't throw  up anywhere in the house.</p><p>Will  my life always be this? Will I forever be just a housewife?</p><p>Kasumi  had no doubts she wanted to have her own family someday but before  she does settle down to the same life she had been living since  taking over her mother's duties she wanted to experience more of  life. It was the reason younger men bored her. They only thought of  one thing and she wanted more than that. It was her hope that since  older men already had their sexual urges satisfied, they were  interested in other pursuits as well, like travel.</p><p>On  some days and nights when she was bored out of her skull, Kasumi had  wondered about the adventures Ranma must have had on his ten-year  training journey. She did not envy his life to be sure, but what he  must have experienced on that journey had always intrigued her. The  things he had seen, heard, tasted, smelled and felt. Sometimes she  thought he had enough memories to fill ten lifetimes. Definitely  enough bedtime stories to tell to children for years. Too bad his  father thought of nothing outside the martial arts, neglecting his  overall growth. Kasumi was sure Ranma could have done just as well in  other endeavors.</p><p>Her  thoughts turned to their recently departed pig-tailed house guest. To  be honest she was surprised at how well he had developed under  someone like Uncle Genma. He surely has some rough edges to him but  considering who he had for a role model and teacher it was a miracle  he wasn't worse. He was kind-hearted, honorable beyond his father,  polite when he wanted to be, a complete gentleman when it came to  girls, was a better seamstress and cook than either of her sisters,  had a well-developed physique girls drooled over, a face that was  pleasant to look at and possessed a surprisingly sharp mind that  could do amazing analytical feats.</p><p>Kasumi  sighed at the last thought. It was such a waste that Uncle Genma did  not see fit to develop Ranma's intellectual skills more. Kasumi  boggled at what Ranma could accomplish or achieve if someone nurtured  that potential. She smiled. Perhaps now that his mother is back in  his life she could see that potential finally unleashed. And some of  the rough edges smoothened out. She hoped Ranma had a better life  from now on.</p><p>The  smile lessened as her thoughts went back to her own life. She would  turn twenty in another couple of months and would be expected to  marry soon. She thought of kindly and silly Dr. Tofu and was torn  inside. She liked him and but marrying him meant more of the life she  now lived. She wasn't prepared for that yet. However she didn't know  if he could wait until she was ready to settle down. She knew his  mother was pressuring him to marry and have grandchildren now.  Marriage, pregnancy then babies. She didn't want that yet. Her  eyebrows furrowed as she considered what to do. After several minutes  of indecision and since she couldn't sleep she decided she might as  well check on her father. She rose and put on a robe over her  nightgown before leaving her room.</p><p>Ukyo  hummed happily to herself as she prepared to go to bed. It was one of  the happiest days of her life. Even happier than the day she learned  that Ranchan did not abandon her knowingly all those years ago.</p><p>She  had met Ranchan's mother and the results were better beyond her  greatest expectations. Not only was Auntie Saotome beautiful, kind,  fair and saner than most adults in Nerima she had a sense of honor  that was severely lacking in Ranma's father. She had without  hesitation recognized Ukyo's engagement to her son. That alone made  Nodoka Saotome number one in Ukyo's book. Ukyo shook her head and  wondered for the gazzilionth time how such a woman could marry  someone like the jackass Ranma was cursed to have for a father.</p><p>I  must be missing something.</p><p>For  whatever reason, Ukyo fervently beseeched the heavens that Ranchan do  not turn out the same way his asshole of a father-panda did. She  shuddered if ever she wound up marrying Ranchan and he did turn out  like his father. She quickly banished the horrible image.</p><p>The  fates couldn't be that cruel, could they?</p><p>She  turned her attention to more pleasant matters like how to impress  Ranchan's mother more.</p><p>She  seems to be a traditional woman. I guess I'll have to dress more  lady-like from now on.</p><p>Ukyo  quickly check her wardrobe and found to her chagrin that she severely  lacked feminine clothing, she even had only one set of the Furinkan  girl's uniform.</p><p>I'll  have to do some shopping. Hmmm... wonder if Auntie would like it if I  invite her to accompany me shopping? It'd be a good opportunity for  us to get to know more about each other. Yeah, I'll ask Ranchan  tomorrow.</p><p>With  that happy thought Ukyo turn off the light and went to sleep with a  smile adorning her beautiful face, the loneliness of her life  temporarily forgotten as she looked forward to the new day and  hopefully the start of a much better and happier life.</p><p>In  another restaurant in another part of Nerima, the residents were also  preparing for bed.</p><p>Shampoo  was in as much a good mood as Ukyo as she finished her chores humming  happily along, her happiness almost having a physical manifestation.  This did not escape the notice of the two other residents.</p><p>Cologne  had a grin on her face that would have the most battle-hardened musk  warrior fleeing for his life wondering what diabolical scheme the  Amazon Elder was concocting to have such a hideous expression.  Luckily for the other residents, one was too happy to notice while  the other was too blind to see. Cologne was also glad at how the day  had gone and she indulged herself to bask in the warmth her  great-granddaughter was radiating.</p><p>But  she was still an elder. With a sigh she called for Shampoo's  attention.</p><p>{Great-granddaughter,  I see you are in a very good mood tonight.}</p><p>{Aiyah!  I'm very, very happy, great-grandmother! Many good things happened  today!}</p><p>That  perked up the ears of the remaining resident. He tried not to be to  conspicuous as he listened. The other two noticed  he was eavesdropping but simply ignored him.</p><p>{Yes,  we have much to be thankful for today, child, but the battle is not  yet over and we must not rest till then. There is still much to be  done.}</p><p>{Aiyah!  I know this great-grandmother and I will double my efforts to win  Airen.}</p><p>That  earned a scowl from the eavesdropper.</p><p>{That  is good to hear, Shampoo, but you must realize that there are now new  rules to the battle that we must abide by. We must reconsider our  tactics very carefully.}</p><p>New  rules? What could the dried up old monkey mean by that?</p><p>[Bonk!]</p><p>Mousse  crashed to the floor with a big lump on his head.</p><p>{It  would be best for you, Mousse, not to think such thoughts out loud  especially when I am only a few feet away.}</p><p>{As  I was saying, Shampoo, we must reconsider the way we have been trying  to win son-in-law.}</p><p>{I  know this great-grandmother. Airen's mother have now made my  engagement to Airen official and Airen have left the Kitchen  Destroyer's house. It makes things simpler.}</p><p>{And  at the same time more complicated, child.}</p><p>{What  do you mean, great-grandmother?}</p><p>{Mostly  we must not displease son-in-law's mother. I believe she can be a  great ally if treated with respect but an even greater enemy if  provoked unnecessarily.}</p><p>{Yes,  I agree great-grandmother. Airen's mother is a great woman with great  honor. I will respect honored elder's wishes. What do I have to do?}</p><p>{To  begin with, you must stop calling your rivals insulting names like  'spatula girl', 'kitchen destroyer', 'mercenary girl', and 'crazy  ribbon girl' and you will try to get along with them. No more  'obstacles are for killing' or 'kisses of death'. I feel son-in-law's  mother has taken a liking to them and will not take kindly to such  actions.} And hopefully you will like them enough to have them as  co-wives. Shampoo pouted.</p><p>{That's  no fun!}</p><p>{Nevertheless,  it is something you must do.} Shampoo grudgingly nodded. {Second is  the way you speak Japanese.} Cologne gave a small sigh. {Really,  Shampoo, it's a little too childish even for you to resort to such  tactics.}</p><p>{But  it makes me sound cuter when I speak like that!} Shampoo pouted even  more.</p><p>Cologne  blinked and sighed in exasperation. Ancestors, give me strength!  The sheer vanity of the girl!</p><p>{You  are 'cute' enough as you are already. Son-in-law's mother will want a  daughter-in-law who can speak Japanese properly.}</p><p>{Oh,  alright, great-grandmother!} [grumble, grumble] {phooey.}</p><p>"From  now on we shall converse in Japanese."</p><p>"Yes,  great-grandmother."</p><p>"Good.  Third is that we will no longer resort to magic and potions.  Son-in-law's mother will not approve or tolerate such tactics."</p><p>Shampoo  thought about that for a while. "You do not have to tell me  that, great-grandmother. No mother would want their child to be  enslaved."</p><p>"Good,  good. Last for now is the way you dress."</p><p>Shampoo  blinked. "What's wrong with the way I dress?" She looked  down at her short cheongsam. "I love the way I dress. Its very  practical for a martial artist and it shows my assets well. It's very  funny to see boys and men getting nose bleeds, walking into things  and passing out when I pass by on my bicycle while on the fence."</p><p>"It  is not proper for a Japanese girl to wear clothing so revealing."</p><p>"Then  why do all those other schools' girls' uniform have short skirts?  I've always wondered why it is only in Nerima where the girls' school  uniforms are so prudish."</p><p>Cologne  blinked. Shampoo did have a point. Why do Nerima's schools have  such prudish uniforms for girls? It was something to ponder upon.</p><p>"Very  well, continue the way you dress. But if son-in-law's mother makes a  comment you will listen carefully."</p><p>With  that the the discussion ended and Shampoo and Cologne went up to  their respective rooms to sleep. Shampoo dreamed of tomorrow and its  endless possibilities.</p><p>On  the floor of the Nekohanten, Mousse gingerly pried himself from the  floor where he had been listening.</p><p>So  Ranma's mother is in town. Interesting. Maybe its something I can  take adavantage of.</p><p>He  carefully dusted his robes and went to his own room to make plans.</p><p>Nabiki  was surprised to see Akane sitting at the kitchen table drinking milk  this late at night. Or should that be this early in the morning.  Nabiki greeted her kid sister as she went to the refrigerator to get  something to snack on. She settled for some crackers and a soda and  went to sit opposite Akane.</p><p>Maybe  it'll do me some good to talk to someone, at least take my mind off  my problem.</p><p>"So  can't sleep either, huh?" Nabiki noted the tear streaks and  reddish eyes but decided not to comment on them.</p><p>Akane  sighed. "That obvious, huh?"</p><p>"Yep.  Me too."</p><p>Akane  perked at that. "Oh, and why is that?"</p><p>Nabiki  winced. Wrong thing to say. "I wished I knew." Nabiki  tried to lie.</p><p>Akane  didn't buy it. "Well, only one thing I can think of why we  can't sleep."</p><p>It  was Nabiki's turn to sigh. Well its official. If Akane can see  through my lie then I'm definitely not myself tonight. "That  obvious, huh?"</p><p>Akane  snorted. "Yep." She paused. "You miss the jerk,  too, huh?"</p><p>"Yeah,  hard to imagine, right? Me, the 'Ice Queen' of Furinkan, being  capable of missing someone."</p><p>"Its  not really that hard to imagine. You do miss mother, don't you?"</p><p>Nabiki  shrugged.</p><p>"Well,  I know you do miss mother and that means you're not totally the 'Ice  Queen' you want people to think you are."</p><p>Nabiki  shrugged again, munching on a cracker.</p><p>"So  why do you miss the jerk?"</p><p>"Why  do you always call him a jerk and pervert?" Nabiki was  uncomfortable with the questions so she decided to turn the tables.</p><p>"Hey,  I asked first." ... "How about we make a deal? I ask a  question and if you answer honestly then you get to ask a question.  If I answer honestly I get to ask another question and so on. Deal?"</p><p>"Why  do you get to ask the first question?"</p><p>Akane  sighed "Okay, okay. Let's play rock-paper-scissors for it."</p><p>Nabiki  shrugged. It was something to do to while away the time. Nabiki won  the right to ask first. Akane grumbled under her breath.</p><p>"So  first question, why do you always call him a jerk and a pervert?"</p><p>"Because  he is a jerk and a pervert!"</p><p>"So  why..."</p><p>"Hey,  my turn!"</p><p>"But  you didn't really answer the question! Honestly, Akane, why do you  call him a jerk and pervert?"</p><p>"As  if you didn't know! He insults me, annoys me, doesn't want to eat my  cooking, doesn't spar with me, does all these weird things and has  all these girls chasing him."</p><p>"Well  I'll give you that he can be an aggravating SOB at times but all the  other things you've said isn't his fault or just him being honest,  too honest."</p><p>"Well,  he knows how to lie, also!"</p><p>"But  not when it counts right?"</p><p>"Why  are you defending him?"</p><p>"Why  are you so angry at him? Damn it, Akane, can't  you see how lucky you are to have someone like Ranma or are you just  too proud to admit it? He's not perfect but he's way better than  most guys we know and you know it! Well, then, if you can't  appreciate what you have then maybe someone else should have it!"</p><p>Akane  and Nabiki glared at each other.</p><p>"Oh,  my! Nabiki, Akane, it's not nice to make so much noise this late at  night."</p><p>"Kasumi!"  They both cried at once.</p><p>"Why  are you up so late, sis?" Nabiki was the first to regain her  composure. "We didn't wake you did we?" Nabiki was a  little guilty.</p><p>"Oh  no. You didn't wake me up. I just couldn't sleep and I thought to  check on father."</p><p>"I  checked on him earlier." Akane volunteered. "He's passed  out dead drunk on the porch. I can smell the sake all the into the  living room."</p><p>"Oh,  my. Did he throw up anywhere in the house."</p><p>"I  didn't notice any vomit but I think it'd be a good idea to keep him  on the porch in case he does vomit."</p><p>Kasumi  thought for a while. She didn't like the idea of leaving their father  out in the cold but cleaning vomit didn't appeal to her at the  moment. She decided to compromise.</p><p>"Oh,  well, I'll just bring him some pillows and blanket so he wouldn't be  too uncomfortable and catch a cold."</p><p>Kasumi  went back into the house and returned after several minutes.</p><p>"You  were right Akane, the living room did smell of sake."</p><p>Akane  shrugged.</p><p>"So  what were my two baby sisters arguing about?"</p><p>The  two blushed.</p><p>"Would  you believe we were fighting over Ranma?" Nabiki answered.</p><p>"Oh,  my. Why would you two fight over Ranma?"</p><p>"I  don't know. I couldn't sleep and went down for a snack and found  violent, uncute, built-like-a-brick tomboy here drinking milk."  Nabiki couldn't resist taunting Akane. Akane steamed.</p><p>"Why  you..."</p><p>"Nabiki!  That's not nice!" Kasumi gaved the middle sister the dreaded  look. Nabiki crumbled like a cookie.</p><p>"Oh,  alright. I take back what I said."</p><p>"Now  that's better isn't it? We can discuss more if we do it in a  civilized manner."</p><p>"Sometimes,  you're just too nice, sis."</p><p>"Why  thank you, Nabiki. That's so sweet of you." Nabiki simply  blinked.</p><p>"Anyway...  I just asked baby sister here why she always calls Ranma a jerk and a  pervert and she started getting all defensive..."</p><p>"I  did not get defensive! And he is a jerk and a pervert!"</p><p>"Akane,  its not nice to interrupt and shout when someone else is speaking."</p><p>"Um,  sorry, sis. Its just that Nabiki's putting words into my mouth."</p><p>"So  why do you always call him those awful words?"</p><p>"Because  he is a jerk and a pervert. He insults me, won't eat my cooking but  eats all the others', won't spar with me, picks on poor P-Chan and  Ryoga..."</p><p>Nabiki  flinched inside at the mention of the pet and the lost boy.  Fortunately neither of her sisters noticed it.</p><p>"So  what he says and does bothers you?"</p><p>"Who  wouldn't be bothered?"</p><p>"So  why do you put up with him?" Nabiki butted in.</p><p>"What  do you think? Its all because of this engagement nonsense and thanks  to you two I'm stuck with it!"</p><p>"So  its all because of the honor contract between our families and  nothing else you put up with all the crap you say he gives you?"</p><p>"Of  course!"</p><p>"So  if one of us," Nabiki indicated Kasumi and herself "were  to volunteer to be the fiancee you'd give him up?" Nabiki saw  an opportunity and went for it.</p><p>Red  warning lights were flashing but Akane had her anger and pride  blinders on. She bulled ahead.</p><p>"I'll  even have him gift-wrapped!"</p><p>"Okay,  I volunteer then."</p><p>Akane  and Kasumi blinked.</p><p>"You?"  Akane was incredulous. "Yeah, right!" Akane snorted.  "Like last time you volunteered? I may not like the jerk much  but I'm not that cruel!"</p><p>The  barb stung but Nabiki maintained her composure. Not a nice thing  to say to your sister, Akane.</p><p>"Akane,  apologize to Nabiki at once." Kasumi reprimanded in a low,  serious tone. Akane cringed at the feeling of guilt the admonishment  elicited.</p><p>"Nabiki,  I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I didn't mean what I said!"</p><p>"Last  time was a mistake, I see that now." Nabiki admitted. "Funny  how a life-changing event can make you see things in another light."  Nabiki paused, unsure whether to continue or not. "The reason I  couldn't sleep was because I had this uncomfortable gnawing feeling  inside me. Its the same feeling I get when I let a good deal slip  away. And the good deal is the person you call a jerk and a pervert  and I let him slip away."</p><p>Nabiki  breathed deeply before she continued.</p><p>"I  realized something while in bed. Despite knowing my reputation and  the way I mistreated him Ranma still believed in me and actually  cared for me. I saw that when I pretended to be his fiancee. He  believed me when I said I loved him, he felt flustered when I teased  him, he protected me, he tried not to hurt me, he did everything he  could to please me _and_ he even called me a 'normal, defenseless  girl' and not the 'Ice Queen'! I can think of no other boy who would  or will do that for me."</p><p>Nabiki  paused again.</p><p>"So  Akane, if you don't want the jerk then I will gladly take him off  your hands. And I promise you it will be different this time. This  time I won't give or even sell him back."</p><p>Akane  stared, thunderstruck. She didn't know what to do. Her sister just  poured her heart out. Her sister the 'Ice Queen OF Furinkan' saying  she had feelings for her fiancee. Akane shook her head. It can't  be real. It must be a nightmare. That's it it must be a nightmare.  One way to find out. She hit her head on the table.</p><p>[Bonk!]</p><p>"Ow!  That hurt!" So it wasn't a nightmare, it was real. Uh, oh.</p><p>"Akane,  if you wanted to make sure this isn't just a dream you could have  simply pinched yourself." Nabiki pointed out.</p><p>Akane  blinked. "I knew that!" she huffed.</p><p>"So  what's it going to be? Are you going to give your engagement to Ranma  to me?"</p><p>"I...  I..." Akane didn't know what to say. How could her sister  do this to her? Her own sister! Doesn't she know how I feel?  Akane blinked. Of course she does, you idiot! You just said you  didn't want Ranma! She screamed at her herself. Akane would have  kicked herself in the back of her head if that was possible. She  tried anyway.</p><p>[Pop!  Thud!] Akane fell to the floor.</p><p>"Ow!"</p><p>"Akane,  are you alright?" Kasumi asked in a worried tone as she looked  over.</p><p>"I'll  be fine, sis. I just need to pop my hip back into place. Just a sec."</p><p>[Pop!]  Akane tried rotating her hip.</p><p>"Ah,  that's better." She didn't notice the green tinge on her  sisters' cheeks. "Where were we?"</p><p>"Nabiki  just asked you a very important question, Akane. I think you should  consider your answer very carefully."</p><p>Akane  blinked again, remembering the spot her sister put her in.</p><p>"Why  are you doing this, Nabiki?"</p><p>"Why  shouldn't I? And why should you care?"</p><p>"Because  I do care!" Whoops! Shouldn't have said that.</p><p>"You  care about what?" Nabiki pressed.</p><p>"None  of your business!"</p><p>"Okay,  then you agree to give up your engagement to Ranma to me? We have  Kasumi here as a witness."</p><p>"No,  I don't! And you can't make me!"</p><p>"Why?  You just said he's just a jerk and pervert who annoys and insults  you? Why don't you go to Ryoga? He likes you, doesn't insult you,  seems to enjoy your cooking or at least tries to eat it and you  yourself have siad he's not a pervert or a jerk like Ranma."</p><p>"That's  not the point and you know it!" Akane was getting frustrated.</p><p>"Know  what, Akane? What is the point of all this?"</p><p>"Ooohhh...!  If you weren't my sister I'd... You know exactly what I mean!"</p><p>"That  you don't like Ranma, that you hit him for the littlest of reasons,  that you think he's a jerk and pervert, and that you only tolerate  him because of the honor contract between our families and because we  dumped him on you? Which, by the way, I now know was a mistake. A  mistake I'm willing to correct now."</p><p>"That's  not true! And that's not what I meant!"</p><p>"What's  not true?"</p><p>"Aaarrrggghhh!"  Akane was beyond frustration. Nabiki had out-argued her at every turn  but she wasn't going to give up just yet. And she wasn't just about  to admit to anything yet, not under these circumstances. She turned  to Kasumi for some breathing space.</p><p>"What  about you, Kasumi? Don't you have any say in this?"</p><p>"Oh,  I think you two are saying everything very well."</p><p>"That's  not what I meant!" Akane blinked. "I'm sorry Kasumi, I  didn't mean to shout at you. It's just that..." Akane wrung her  hands.</p><p>"It's  alright, Akane. I know it must be very frustrating for you right now  with Ranma suddenly gone."</p><p>"Don't  you have anything to say about Ranma? Why are you up anyway?"</p><p>"I  had difficulty falling asleep."</p><p>"Why  can't you sleep? Don't tell me you miss the jerk too?" Akane  was beyond incredulous.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled. "Don't you, Akane? Whether we like it not, Ranma and  his father affected our lives very much. And now that they're gone  its only natural for us to have some difficulty adjusting again."</p><p>"So  how did Ranma affect you, sis?" Nabiki was curious. She  couldn't imagine Kasumi, the bedrock of their home, ruffled by  someone leaving.</p><p>"Do  you remember how our live were before they came? After mother died?"</p><p>"What's  there to remember?"</p><p>"That  is exactly what I mean. There's not much to remember in those years.  But ever since Ranma came into our lives, life have been... oh, I  don't know, exciting?"</p><p>"That's  understating it."</p><p>"Yes,  yes, but do you understand what I'm trying to say? Before Ranma came  we barely lived our lives. It was the same thing over and over again,  day in and day out. Don't get me wrong, I love doing housework but I  have always felt that there must be more to life. That is the reason  why I don't like younger men. They're just too boring. They are  interested in only one thing."</p><p>"You  got that right, sis." Akane said under her breath.</p><p>"But  Ranma is anything but boring, right sis?"</p><p>Kasumi  colored a little. "Yes, you can say that. I felt more alive in  the past few months than I did all those years." Kasumi paused.  "I've often wondered about what Ranma experienced on his  training trip. The places he'd been to, the sights he'd seen, the  sounds he'd heard, the people he'd met... even now he goes off to one  adventure after another. How much I wish I could have gone on some of  those."</p><p>"Have  you gone insane, sis? Why would you want to go on one of Ranma's  _mis_adventures?" Emphasis on the mis. Akane couldn't believe  what she just heard.</p><p>"Akane,  if you lived your life the way I have you would understand why I want  to."</p><p>"But  what about Dr. Tofu, sis?" Akane asked.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled. "Oh, I _do_ like Dr. Tofu, he's so nice and silly, but  I don't think I'm ready for the kind of life being his wife will be.  I will be doing more of the same things I've been doing all these  years. And with his mother wanting to have grandchildren right away  I don't think I'll have much chance having more out of life."</p><p>"But  I"m sure if you told Dr. Tofu want you wanted he'd happily give  it to you."</p><p>"I  wouldn't feel that would be right. Dr. Tofu has lived his life's  adventures and now all he wants is a simple life. Someday I want that  life but not now." Kasumi continued sadly. "The problem  is I don't think he can wait until I am ready with his mother pushing  him very hard to marry and have grandchildren now."</p><p>"So  you're giving up on Dr. Tofu?"</p><p>Kasumi  sighed. "I don't know but if he asked me to marry him today...  I don't think I can say yes."</p><p>"I  see." Akane would have thought she'd be happier at the news but  somehow it didn't. She gave up on Dr. Tofu all those months ago when  it became clear Dr. Tofu only had eyes for Kasumi _and_ only saw her  as a little girl. She didn't think she can convince him otherwise  even now.</p><p>"What  exactly are you saying, Kasumi?" Nabiki didn't want any  misunderstanding.</p><p>"I  don't know exactly what I'm saying, Nabiki, but I do know I want  something more out of my life right now than just being a plain  housewife."</p><p>"Do  you know who, how or where to get more out of your life?"</p><p>"I  don't know. What I do know is that the best chance I have to get more  out of my life is by being close to Ranma."</p><p>Nabiki  nodded in understanding. "Strange how much effect one boy has  on so many lives."</p><p>Kasumi  smiled. "He does have that effect, doesn't he?"</p><p>Nabiki  smiled in return. "And the jerk doesn't even know it. What do  you plan to do about it?"</p><p>"I  don't know. What can I do about it?"</p><p>"Hmmm...  okay how about this. Are you willing to risk not doing anything about  it?"</p><p>Kasumi  went quiet.</p><p>Akane  did not like the way their conversation went. Her sisters liked  Ranma? The pervert! He even had the gall to seduce her sisters! Wait  till she gets her hands on him! I'm going to do this, then do  that... A silly grin appeared on Akane's face as she imagined  what she was going to do to Ranma.</p><p>"Akane?"  Akane was brought out her reverie by Kasumi's question.</p><p>"Yes,  Kasumi?"</p><p>"How  do you really feel about Ranma?"</p><p>Akane  immediately squirmed under the combined gaze of her two sisters.</p><p>"Uh,  um, I don't know what you mean, sis." She stalled. "Oh,  look at the time! Its way past bedtime! Good night, Kasumi, Nabiki."  She tried to make a break for it. Too bad she's a klutz. She  immediately tripped on her own foot. She scrambled on all fours to  get out of the kitchen.</p><p>"Akane."  That one word from the eldest sister brought the youngest sister to a  halt.</p><p>"Akane,  please sit down." Kasumi waited until Akane had sat down again.  "Please, Akane, we are having a serious discussion right now.  Something that may have major repercussions on our lives."</p><p>"What  brought this about?" Akane felt like a deer in a hunter's cross  hairs.</p><p>"Gee,  I dunno, Akane. Maybe its the fact that we had a life-changing event  yesterday?"</p><p>"Aren't  you putting too much into Ranma's leaving?"</p><p>"Well  we can definitely say his arrival changed our lives so why can't we  say the same about his departure?"</p><p>"Akane,  please, this is important for all of us. How do you honestly feel  about Ranma?"</p><p>"How  do think I feel about the jerk?"</p><p>"We  don't know, Akane. If you really don't like him and the engagement is  simply a burden to you, would it make you feel better if the  engagement was transferred to either me or Nabiki? It seems we are  both willing to take a chance with it."</p><p>"I...  I..." Why are they doing this to me? Don't they know how I  feel?</p><p>"So  what's it gonna be, sis?"</p><p>"What  about Ranma? Doesn't he have a say in this?"</p><p>"Well  if you really don't like him and the engagement I don't think he's  going to force you to continue being his fiancee."</p><p>"Now  quit stalling already!"</p><p>Akane  looked down at the table and twirled her fingers nervously. This was  it. She was being asked by her sisters, two of the dearest persons in  the world to her, how she felt about the boy they were both  interested in.</p><p>"I...  I don't know how I feel about him." That's not true you  stupid idiot! You just don't want to say it!</p><p>Nabiki  sighed. "Akane, how would you feel if you lost Ranma?"</p><p>"I...  I..." The words caught in her throat. Lose Ranma? No, I  can't lose Ranma. I don't want to lose Ranma. "Why are you  doing this to me?"</p><p>"Becasue,  Akane, we already lost Ranma from our home, we're afraid we might  lose Ranma from our lives as well. Answer honestly, Akane, can you  imagine yourself without Ranma?"</p><p>Several  minutes of silence followed the question. The sisters could clearly  hear the ticking of the clock in the living room.</p><p>"No,  I can't." It came out as a whisper but was heard clearly in the  silence. "I don't know what I'd do if I lose him. I don't want  to lose him. I care for him too much." Tears begun to fall.  Pride and anger, the two emotions that had helped keep her going ever  since the death of their mother, had taken a beating. "I hate  him for making me feel this way and I hate myself for letting him  make me feel this way!" Shuddering sobs followed the tears.</p><p>Kasumi  quickly went to hug her youngest sister. Akane cried into the  comforting embrace of her sister. She felt Nabiki's reassuring hand  on her shoulder and grasped it with her own. The three sisters shared  the tender moment. They had been through many trials and tribulations  ever since they lost their parents, one to death and the other to  sorrow. They will get through this one also. They clung together for  several minutes.</p><p>"I'm...  I'm okay now sis." Akane let go of Kasumi and wiped her tears  away.</p><p>"Are  you sure, Akane?" worry was etched on the two elder sisters'  faces.</p><p>"Yes,  I'm sure. It just took a lot out of me to admit to that, that's all."</p><p>"Yes,  it must have been very hard for you and you were very brave and  strong to do it."</p><p>"Thanks,  Kasumi." Akane felt much better now, like a great burden had  been lifted.</p><p>"So  you're keeping your engagement to Ranma, sis?"</p><p>"Yes,  yes I am." The admission made her heart sing.</p><p>"I'm  happy for you, Akane." Nabiki couldn't keep some of the sadness  she felt completely from her voice. Will I ever find someone like  Akane has found Ranma? "Don't do anything stupid to lose  him."</p><p>"Sis..."  Akane felt the emotion in Nabiki's voice. "Do you really mean  what you said about Ranma?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"How  about you Kasumi? Did you also mean what you said?"</p><p>Kasumi  looked away. "Yes. I'm sorry, Akane. I..."</p><p>"Don't  be, Kasumi, I know why you feel the way you do about Ranma because  that's how I feel too."</p><p>Kasumi  looked back at Akane. "Thank you, Akane, for understanding."</p><p>"No,  if there's someone who has to say thanks, it's me. I have to thank  you both for making me face my feelings. I've been a fool not to  admit it until I almost lost him."</p><p>"I'm  glad you did also, Akane. Hopefully you two will be able to get along  better from now on."</p><p>"I  hope so, Kasumi, I hope so." Akane paused, wondering if she  should continue. I should, I must. They're my sisters. "What  about you two? What are you going to do now?"</p><p>"What  else but wish you all the luck, you'll going to do it." Nabiki  responded as cheerfully as she possibly could. She put on her fake  smile.</p><p>"I  don't feel its right that you'll have to give up your chances at  happiness just because of me."</p><p>"No,  Akane, we gave up our chances at Ranma when we dumped him on you when  he first arrived. We don't have any right to pursue him if you're  still willing to go through with the engagement, after all you've  been through."</p><p>"Nabiki  is right, Akane. We made a mistake when we did that, we both see that  now."</p><p>"But  still, I don't feel right knowing I took away your chances at  happiness."</p><p>"Who  knows, Akane, we might still find someone."</p><p>"What  if you don't?"</p><p>Kasumi  and Nabiki forced a smile on their faces. "I'm sure we will."  There was little confidence.</p><p>"No,  its just not right." Akane looked thoughtful for several  moments. "Besides who knows who Ranma will marry? It's not sure  I'll be the one. Maybe he likes one of you better than me." It  was said a little tightly.</p><p>"What  are you saying Akane?"</p><p>"I'm  saying that you should act on your feelings. Who knows, maybe Ranma  will pick one of you."</p><p>"Akane,  I don't know what to say. Are you sure about this?"</p><p>"You  two have been taking care of me since mother died. I know I've not  been the best baby sister in the world and I may not always show it  but I really do appreciate all you've done and sacrificed for me.  This is one way of saying thanks."</p><p>"Akane."  Kasumi hugged her sister again.</p><p>"Well,  well, what do you know. Beneath that spoiled brat exterior actually  lives a human being." Nabiki teased.</p><p>"Hey!  I can say the same thing about you! Imagine, the Ice Queen having  feelings."</p><p>"Now,  now, you two. Its not nice to fight, especially among sisters."</p><p>"So  what do we do now?"</p><p>"I  suggest we go to sleep now." Kasumi indicated the time. "We've  much to think about and being well rested will help. We can continue  our talk tomorrow after school."</p><p>"Yeah,  I guess you're right, sis." Nabiki yawned, she threw her soda  can into the wastebasket. "See you in the morning."</p><p>"Need  any help, Kasumi?" Akane washed the glass she used and replaced  it in the cupboard.</p><p>"No.  But thank you for asking. I'll just check on father before going up  as well."</p><p>"Okay,  sis. Good night."</p><p>"Good  night, too, Akane."</p><p>In  another house in another part of Nerima a certain pig-tailed martial  artist shuddered violently in his new bed as a feeling of impending  doom settled over him. He knew the feeling well. He was going to get  blamed for something.</p><p>"Whatever  the hell it is, it's not my goddamn fault!" He screamed at the  heavens.</p><p>(1)  In Volume 28 Part 1, 'Mother I'm Ran</p><p>ma!',  of the manga Nodoka tells Ryu Kumon, who is masquerading as Ranma,  that their old house was torn down without much explanation. I'm  taking liberties here.</p><p>(2)  "Battle for Miss Beachside" episode in the anime  television series, season seven.</p><p>Author's  Notes:</p><p>Alagon  commented that Nodoka is "nodoka is badly O.O.C." Well  she is OOC but I don't think too its too way OOC.</p><p>Regarding  the solution he proposed:</p><p>"Shampoo  and ranma are already married according to amazon traditions, ranma  can turn into a woman allowing ukyo, who is legally a man, to marry  him (her?) thus leaving otoko-ranma free to marry akane.</p><p>nope,  no legal problems there at all..."</p><p>I've  answered it in this chapter but for those who missed it, Nodoka  proposed the same thing to Ranma but Ranma refused because if he's  going to marry either Shampoo or Ukyo he wants to marry them properly  under Japanese Law because in the case of Shampoo they're going to  stay in Japan and not in China while in the case of Ukyo he wants her  to regain everything she's lost (honor and womanhood are just  two)because of what his father did to her. I believe Ranma is that  way. Maybe if he has no other choice he might consider it.</p>
