</div>        A  Mother's Tale<p>by  Alex Tomas</p><p>This  is my first work of fan fiction. Reviews welcome.</p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>I  do not own the Ranma characters.</p><p>Conventions:</p><p>"  " - Japanese</p><p>{  } - foreign language (Chinese, English)</p><p>[  ] - sound effects</p><p>- thoughts</p><p>#  # - signs</p><p>_  _ - emphasis</p>Summary:<p>This  happens after season 7 episode 143, Ranma Meets Mother Boy Meets Mom,  Part I in the television series or volume 22 chapter 2 of the manga.  It takes elements from both the anime and the manga.</p><p>Ranma's  mother, Nodoka Saotome, on her way for the first time to the Tendo  Dojo sees male-type Ranma fall into the storm drain and transform  into girl-type Ranma. Ranma stutters some excuse but Nodoka waves it  off as she is in a hurry and proceeds to the the Tendo Dojo without  giving out each other's names.</p><p>I  am assuming that Nodoka does not know the Tendos and has no knowledge  of the honor contract Genma and Soun entered into to unite their two  families. My reason is that if Genma  informed her then she would know the Tendos and vice-versa.</p>Chapter  4: Who's Your Mama?<p>Nodoka  was alone at the Saotome home preparing dinner for herself and Ranma  in the kitchen when she heard someone knock on the door. Slightly  puzzled as she was sure she gave Genma and Ranma keys to their house  and she was not expecting any guests, she left the vegetables on the  kitchen counter as she went to answer the door. She was further  puzzled when she saw several delivery men standing outside the door  bearing armloads of packages.</p><p>"Yes,  may I help you?" She asked the man at the door who seemed to be  the one in charge.</p><p>"Is  this the Saotome residence?" The man who had Nakajima written  on his jumpers replied.</p><p>"Yes,  this is the Saotome residence. What may I do for you?"</p><p>"Is  a Mrs. Nodoka Saotome home?"</p><p>"I  am she." Nodoka was now really puzzled. She did not remember  ordering anything for delivery.</p><p>"Please  sign all these and I'll have my people bring the packages inside."  Nakajima held out a clipboard that had several pieces of paper  clipped to it and a pen.</p><p>Nodoka  looked at the clipboard and pen in puzzlement. "Excuse me, I do  not mean to be rude, but may I inquire as to what this is? I do not  remember ordering anything for delivery today." Certainly  not this many.</p><p>"Ah,  well, I'm not too sure also, Mrs. Saotome. I was just told by my boss  to drop everything and to deliver all this to you ASAP. I'm kind of  wondering also since the department store doesn't  usually send out the head of its delivery section." The man  scratched his head apologetically.</p><p>"Do  you know who sent all these?"</p><p>"All  I know is the name, a Miss Kodachi Kuno. Really strange. When the  department store manager put down the phone he danced as if he just  won the lottery and kept on mumbling about bonuses and promotions."  Nakajima shrugged. "Considering how much Miss Kodachi Kuno is  giving to you I'm not surprised." He gestured behind him where  Nodoka saw several delivery trucks waiting to be unloaded. She  blinked several times.</p><p>"Oh,  my." Kodachi is more serious about Ranma than I thought.</p><p>"You  can say that again, ma'am." He held out the clipboard and pen  again. "If you don't mind, ma'am, I really need to get started  unloading, we'll probably take at least a couple of hours."</p><p>"Oh,  dear, where are my manners. Of course." Nodoka stepped aside  and opened the door. "Won't you please come in and have some  tea?"</p><p>"My  pleasure, ma'am." He stepped into the house. "Where do  you want my men to put them?"</p><p>"Oh,  my. I don't think there'll be enough space inside the house. Please,  sit down."</p><p>"I  think you're right, ma'am. We'll have to put some of them outside.  Excuse me for one minute, ma'am." Nakajima took a two-way radio  from his belt and conversed with someone. After a minute he put it  back and stepped out to give some orders to his men. He came back  several minutes later. "Mrs. Nodoka, I hope you don't mind but  I told my men to put some of the packages in your backyard. I also  ordered some tarpaulins from the department store so they'll be  protected a little from the weather. No cost to you, the manager was  more than happy to give it free of charge."</p><p>"Oh.  Thank you." Nodoka was still feeling a little lost. "Do  you know how I can contact Miss Kuno?"</p><p>"Wait  one moment, ma'am. I'll ask my boss." He again talked into his  two-way radio and then wrote something down on a piece of paper.  "Here, Mrs. Saotome, this is the phone number and address of   Miss Kodachi my boss gave me." He gave the paper to Nodoka.</p><p>"Thank  you very much." She put away the paper in her sleeves, she'll  call later, she had guests to attend to. "Please have some tea  and crackers."</p><p>"Thank  you, ma'am. Much obliged." Nakajima sat down again and reached  out for the tea and crackers.</p><p>"If  you'll excuse me, I'll see to it your men have some refreshments  also."</p><p>"Why,  thank you, Mrs. saotome. That's very kind of you." He looked at  Nodoka as she rose and entered what he assumed to be the kitchen.  Nice lady. Beautful face. Looks to have a decent figure. Too bad  she's married. Nakajima sighed. It seemed all the good ones were  already taken. Should have listened to mother. At forty years  of age he was still not married. After fifteen minutes he finished  his tea and crackers and went out to oversee the work of his men. He  kept one eye on Nodoka as she went about giving refreshments  to his men. He sighed again as she finished and went back into the  house to, he assumed again, prepare dinner. Lucky bastard. What I  would give to have someone like her to come home to. Oh, well. Maybe  I'll still get lucky someday. I'll take a look again at the folder  Nakamura sent. The latest batch of foreign women looking for  Japanese husbands looked promising.</p><p>They  finished in less than an hour, not having to put the packages inside  the house cut their work by more than an hour. After making sure that  the packages left outside were protected by the tarpaulins that  arrived fifteen minutes earlier, Mr. Nakajima bid goodbye to Nodoka.</p><p>After  all the men left, Nodoka was left standing  amid all the packages in her living room, gaping at the delivery form  Mr. Nakajima left. It listed all the items delivered. Nodoka did a  quick count and estimated the monetary value of the gifts to be close  to ten million yen. She looked around.</p><p>Oh,  my. What am I going to do with all these? I can't accept all these  but to return all of them would be rude. Now, how do I say thank you  properly? Perhaps I should have a talk with Kodachi tomorrow.</p><p>She  was wondering what to do with all the packages while waiting for  dinner to be cooked in the kitchen when the doorbell rang again.  Startled out of her thoughts she quickly tried to make her living  room decent enough to receive guests then went to answer the door.  For the second time in one hour she was surprised by what she saw at  the door.</p><p>Waiting  outside was a procession of men and women. At the end of the  procession waited a kago, a kind of palanquin carried by two men. The  men gently laid the kago down and one of them swept aside the  shutters.</p><p>From  within the carriage a young girl around sixteen years old stepped out  wearing the traditional Japanese wedding costume (1): a colorful  Japanese kimono over which an uchikake, a white gown, was worn. The  costume was completed by the tsuno kakushi, a white hood that covered  the hair ornaments called Kanzashi. The sight almost caused Nodoka to  stumble. The girl gracefully walked towards Nodoka, kneeled and bowed  to the older woman.</p><p>"Good  afternoon, mother."</p><p>Both  eyebrows of Nodoka rose on hearing the word 'mother'. Wedding  kimono? Mother? Nodoka decided to ignore the presumptuousness of  the girl for the moment and decided to get to know the girl more.  "You must be Miss Kodachi Kuno. Welcome to my home. Please come  in."</p><p>"Thank  you, mother."</p><p>Nodoka  led Kodachi to the only available seating place in the living room.  "Would you like some tea, Miss Kuno?"</p><p>"Please,  call me Dachi, mother."</p><p>[Sigh]  "Very well, Dachi, would you like some refreshments?"</p><p>"Thank  you very much, mother, but I wouldn't dare impose upon you."</p><p>"Quite  alright, dear. Would some tea and rice cakes be fine?"</p><p>"Of  course, mother."</p><p>"I'll  be a moment." Nodoka rose and entered the kitchen. She checked  on her dinner preparations and decided if would be enough for three.  She came back a minute later bearing a tray with two teacups, a  kettle and two rice cakes. "Please forgive the refreshments."</p><p>"No  need to apologize, mother."</p><p>They  sipped some tea.</p><p>"Dachi,  if I may I would like to take a good look at you. Would you mind  taking off your tsuno kakushi?"</p><p>"Of  course, mother." Kodachi removed the hood to fully reveal her  face and head.</p><p>My,  another pretty girl. Ranma is so lucky to attract such beautiful  girls. "You are very beautiful, Dachi."</p><p>"Thank  you, mother. As are you."</p><p>She  seems to be polite enough. "Thank you, that's very kind of  you. Dachi, I would like to thank you for all the gifts that you give  to me but I simply cannot accept all of them."</p><p>"But  I must insist, mother. They are a small token of my honorable  intentions towards Ranma darling."</p><p>"Ah,  I am honored you think so highly of my son, Dachi, but..."</p><p>[Crash!]</p><p>"Oh,  dear! What was that noise? I think it came from our backyard."  Nodoka rose to investigate the noise followed closely by Kodachi.</p><p>"Of  all the stupid luck in the world, the fire hydrant just had to break  when I was directly over it!" The very wet and very annoyed  girl-type Ranma grumbled to herself as she jumped into their backyard  from the roof of the house across the street. So lost was she in  complaining she didn't see the tarpaulin covered mounds in their  backyard.</p><p>[Trip!] [  Crash!]</p><p>"What  the hell...!" She expected to have another meter or so of air  before landing and was thus unprepared when her foot hit a mound. She  stumbled face first into the dirt. Now what? She pushed her  face off the ground, spat out soil and grass and cleaned her face and  clothes as best as she could. She looked back at what tripped her and  noticed for the first time the dozen or so neatly lined-up tarpaulin  covered mounds. What the hell are all these? She approached  the closest one, looked at it from all angles before deciding it was  safe to touch with a ten foot pole.</p><p>[Poke.] [  Poke.]</p><p>When  the thing didn't blow up she decided to risk slowly raising one side  of the tarpaulin with the pole. What she first saw was a box with the  words 'Sharp Microwave Oven'.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>She  raised the cover higher and saw more boxes with various markings.  Sony seventy-seven inch plasma flat screen TV, Aiwa three-disc DVD  player, JVC five-point-one surround sound system,  Sharp twelve-cubic feet two-door refrigerator, Panasonic two-horse  power split type airconditioner, Hitachi Karaoke system, Yamaha  scooter and various other appliances.</p><p>Why would mom buy all  these stuff? Girl Ranma scratched her head while looking at every  mound. She didn't know how much it all cost only that it must have  cost _a lot_. And why leave them here in the backyard? If pop  sees them... only one way to find out. She turned to enter their  house through the backdoor into the kitchen just in time to see her  mother opening the door.</p><p>"Ranma! Are you all  right? I heard a noise." Nodoka approached her son turned  daughter to check if she was hurt. "Why are you a girl?"</p><p>"I'm fine, mom. Just  didn't see all these stuff and tripped when I landed. Why do we have  all these stuff anyway?"</p><p>"You!" Mother  and daughter-son turned to see Kodachi glaring at girl-type Ranma.  "What are you doing here, you hussy? Did you come to steal my  darling Ranma away from me?"</p><p>"Um, Kodachi? Hehe.  Watcha doing here?"</p><p>"It is you who  should answer that question!"</p><p>Nodoka looked  questioningly at her son. "She really doesn't know?"</p><p>Ranma sighed. "I  tried to tell her, mom, but she just doesn't wanna listen."</p><p>"Silence! I will not  tolerate some harridan harassing my darling Ranma's mother!"  Kodachi took off the wedding kimono to reveal her trademark green  leotard with black roses and gymnastic ribbon. "I will teach  you a lesson!" She launched herself to attack girl Ranma. Ranma  braced herself for the coming fight.</p><p>"Miss Kodachi Kuno,  stop this instant!" The stern voice cut through the building  tension and caused both teenagers to pause and look at the source.</p><p>"Miss Kuno, I will  not tolerate any fighting in my home." Nodoka looked Kodachi in  the eyes. "It is also unbecoming of a lady of your stature."</p><p>"But mother! This,  this hussy has come to take my Ranma darling away! I cannot permit  it!"</p><p>"No, she has not!"  It was said in a voice that would brook no argument. "Now put  away your weapon." At Kodachi's hesitation Nodoka added quietly  but more firmly. "Now, young lady."</p><p>Kodachi looked bewildered  at Nodoka. She had not been addressed in such a manner in a long  time, a lifetime ago. Emotions and memories long forgotten came  trickling back. "Mother?" she whispered to no one. She  silently and obediently complied with the command and stood warily  watching Ranma-girl. "Then why has she come here, mother?"</p><p>"I will explain in a  minute. My _son _ Ranma has something to show you."</p><p>"Mom, are ya sure  about this?"</p><p>"Yes, it is better  for her to know."</p><p>"What does darling  Ranma has to show me, mother? Where is he?" Kodachi looked  around for the boy.</p><p>"In a moment,  Dachi." Nodoka switched back to calling the girl Dachi hoping  it would put the girl more at ease. "Ranma, go get some hot and  cold water from the kitchen but do not turn back inside. I want Dachi  to see it. Dachi, come stand beside me." Ranma went to get the  hot and cold water while Kodachi walked to stand beside Nodoka. The  two women waited until Ranma re-emerged from the house with a cup of  hot and cold water in both hands. Ranma-girl looked questioningly at  her mother. Nodoka turned to face Kodachi and took the girl's hands  in her own, gently but firmly, to reassure the confused girl.</p><p>"Dachi, I want you  to watch very carefully. My son Ranma has a secret you should know.  It may come as a shock to you." Kodachi nodded silently and  both turned back to the red-head. Nodoka braced herself in case  Kodachi did not take the revelation well. "Ranma, please turn  back into a boy." With that Ranma poured the hot water on her  head triggering the change. A loud gasp escaped Kodachi's lips. Ranma  and Nodoka looked at Kodachi waiting for more reaction. Kodachi  blinked several times.</p><p>"Ranma darling?  Where did the hussy go?"</p><p>"I _am_ the 'hussy',  Kodachi. It's what I tried to tell ya at the rhythmic gymnastic  competition."</p><p>"Impossible! My  darling Ranma can never be a half-woman perversity! He is a a paragon  of manhood, a man among men! The only man worthy of one such as  myself!"</p><p>Ranma and Nodoka winced at  the words. Kodachi turned to Nodoka.</p><p>"Surely you cannot  expect me to believe this... this outlandish tale, mother!"</p><p>"I wish it was not  true, Dachi, but it is. My son is under a Jusenkyo curse he received  while on his training journey. The curse turns him into a girl when  he is splashed with cold water while hot water will revert him back  to his true form. I know it is hard to accept but the evidence is  right before your eyes, Dachi. Would it make it easier for you to  believe if you held him with your own hands when he changes?"</p><p>Kodachi dumbly nodded.</p><p>"Then come."  Nodoka held out her hand and when Kodachi hesitantly took it she led  the girl to stand in front of her son. "Take Ranma's hand,  Dachi." Nodoka paused until Kodachi held Ranma's free hand.  "Ranma, please show Dachi." Ranma hesitated until he saw  the pleading look in his mother's eyes. "Please, Ranma, do it  for me." He nodded, took a deep breath and poured the cold  water on himself triggering the curse.</p><p>Kodachi stepped back and  wrenched back her hand as if electrocuted. "The red-haired  witch! How dare you touch me?" She looked around. "And  where did my darling Ranma go?"</p><p>Mother and son facefaulted  hard.</p><p>Girl-Ranma recovered  first. "For God's sake, Kodachi! I am your 'darling-Ranma'!"  I can't believe yer as stupid as your brother!</p><p>"Perhaps another  demonstration is needed, son." Nodoka addressed her now  thoroughly soaked offspring.</p><p>"Another?"  sputtered Ranma.</p><p>"Please, son."  Nodoka begged.</p><p>"Oh, all right! But  this is the last time, mom. I ain't doing it again." Ranma  stomped off to get more hot and cold water, her feet making squishing  sounds in her wet shoes.</p><p>Nodoka and Kodachi waited  for the redheaded girl to return.</p><p>Ranma looked directly at  Kodachi when she got back. "Listen up, Kodachi! Look carefully.  I ain't doing this again so you better take a good look!" She  dumped the hot water.</p><p>[Glomp!]</p><p>Kodachi had Ranma's arms  pinned in her bear hug "Ranma  darling! Where did you go? I feared the wicked hussy kidanapped you."  Kodachi pressed herself against Ranma's masculine chest happily.</p><p>"Kodachi, will ya  get offa me?" Ranma began shivering as Kodachi continued  rubbing herself against him. He looked to his mother for help. "Mom,  don't just stand there!"</p><p>"Wait, Ranma, this  may be what we need to convince her." Nodoka took the cup of  cold water and proceeded to pour it over her son's head.</p><p>Kodachi felt her arms come  loose and she had to stoop as Ranma shrunk. The broad, hard,  well-muscled chest she was burying her face in changed to two soft  and well-developed breasts. Her head jerked back at the new sensation  to stare girl-Ranma square in the blue-grey eyes.</p><p>"Hiya, Dachi! Long  time, no see!" Girl-Ranma grinned inanely. Ya better  believe it now. I ain't doing this again.</p><p>Kodachi's eyes widened in  shock and denial.</p><p>"No. It can't be."  Her eyes swung back and forth wildly from mother to  son-turned-daughter.</p><p>"Dachi?"  Nodoka was worried. It seemed the shock was too great for the  mentally disturbed girl. "Are you all right, Dachi?"</p><p>"No." Kodachi  focused on Nodoka. "Why are you doing this, mother?"</p><p>Nodoka was baffled by  Kodachi's question. It wasn't the question she was expecting. "Why?  To tell you the truth, Dachi."</p><p>"No!" the  gymnast raged. "I cannot accept this! My darling Ranma can  never be a half-woman! It is unthinkable! You!" She pointed an  accusing finger at son-turned-daughter.</p><p>Ranma blinked then pointed  at herself. "Me? What about me?" She didn't understand  what Kodachi was getting at either. Now what?</p><p>"You are trying to  turn me away from my darling Ranma by telling me these... these  malicious falsehoods! You are trying to take my Ranma away from me! I  shall never allow it! I will make you pay not only for besmirching my  darling Ranma but for bewitching his mother as well, hussy! I will  reveal you for what you are!" Kodachi then turned and fled,  leaping over the property walls and onto the rooftops.</p><p>"Dachi, stop!"  Nodoka tried to reach the fleeing girl but her kimono slowed her  down. She whirled to her son-turned-daugther who stood gaping in the  direction the pony-tailed girl had run off to. "Ranma, go after  her! Bring her back!"</p><p>Ranma was snapped out of  her daze by her mother's frantic voice. "Whoa! What just  happened?" Where the heck did Kodachi get such a  lame-brained idea?</p><p>"Ranma, go after her  quick! Bring her back! I'm afraid she might do something rash and  harm not only herself but others! _She needs our help_!"</p><p>The last sentence stirred  the martial artist in Ranma. A resolute look came over her face. "I  will, mom." She sprang into action in pursuit of the runaway  girl leaving her mother praying they were not too late.</p><p>Nodoka looked in the  direction the two teenagers had ran off to long after Ranma was gone  from sight. She shook her head and entered her house to make  preparations. She was confident in her son's ability to bring Kodachi  back but if her instincts were correct there will be an inevitable  fight after a long tiring chase. Food, medicine, baths and beds will  be needed by both youths when they return.</p><p>"We're home!"  Nabiki and Akane called out as they opened the door to their home.  Kasumi went to greet them in her usual simple attire. She didn't want  to chance spilling something on her new dress and ruining it.</p><p>"Welcome home,  Nabiki, Akane. How was your day?" Kasumi asked in a sing-song  voice. Her smile noticeably had more warmth in it and her two younger  sisters felt it.</p><p>Wow! Kasumi's in a  good mood. "Fine, sis. Is dad here?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Oh, no. He and  Uncle Genma went out this morning and haven't returned yet. They  didn't say when they'll be back."</p><p>"That's good then."</p><p>"Good?"</p><p>"Yes, because we can  go out of the house without you worrying about dad."</p><p>"Go out? Why would  we go out? Where would we go?"</p><p>"To Ucchan's. Ukyo  and Shampoo were curious why you brought Ranma lunch wearing that  dress today. They want to know why. _We_ want to know why."  Nabiki pointed to herself and Akane.</p><p>"Oh, my. Did I do  something inappropriate?"</p><p>"Nabiki sighed. "No,  you didn't, sis. We're just curious, that's all. I didn't see you  doing something like that so soon."</p><p>"Oh, it's because I  didn't have anything else to do and Auntie said it wouldn't be  improper if I brought Ranma some lunch at school. She's so nice!"  Kasumi practically gushed. "She even taught me a new recipe!"  She clapped her hands happily together. It was almost like having  their mother back.</p><p>Auntie. I should have  known. "And that's it?"</p><p>"Why, yes, Nabiki.  Should there be anything else?" Kasumi was perplexed.</p><p>"You tell me, sis.  I've never seen you act like the way you did at lunch."</p><p>"Oh, my. Was I  really that different? Oh, I hope I didn't embarrass anyone at  Furinkan." Kasumi's eyebrows met in worry.</p><p>"Not really, just  surprising, and no, you didn't. I guess you were affected by Ranma  more than I thought. Listen, we have to talk before we go to  Ucchan's. We have to sort things out between ourselves first before  we can tell Ukyo and Shampoo what we discussed last, uh, early this  morning."</p><p>"That sounds like a  good idea, Nabiki. Why don't we talk in the living room."  Kasumi led her sisters into the house. She served some refreshments  before they started.</p><p>"First off we have  to settle the question of the engagement. Akane, you're keeping your  engagement to Ranma so your status is clear. That leaves me and  Kasumi."</p><p>"Well, if I remember  correctly it wasn't really specified who among us would be engaged to  Ranma. I just sort of got volunteered for the job by you two."</p><p>"Don't remind me and  yes. Dad and Uncle Saotome only agreed that one of dad's daughters  would marry Uncle Saotome's son."</p><p>"In that case, can't  we just say that all three of us are engaged to Ranma until its  finally decided who marries who?"</p><p>"Are you sure about  that, Akane?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Yes, like I said  it's the least I could do for my sisters."</p><p>"Well, it works for  me. We'll have to convince dad and Uncle Saotome to go back to the  original terms of the contract and make us all Ranma's fiancees. That  won't be much of a problem. Then we have to tell Auntie Nodoka and  Ranma although I don't think Auntie will object to it. It's Ranma I'm  worried about."</p><p>"Why do you say  that, Nabiki?"</p><p>"Well, all we have  to say to dad and Uncle Saotome is that it triples the chances of our  families being joined and they'll fall for it. About Auntie, call it  a gut feel. About Ranma, well, he's got enough problems with three  fiancees, not to mention the hordes of girls who are just dying to  bag him. You and me adding ourselves to the fiancee brigade might  freak him out."</p><p>"Oh, my. I didn't  think of that. Poor Ranma. Do you think he'll be all right?"</p><p>"He'll freak out  some, that's for sure, but Ranma always bounces back. I've never seen  him stay down for long." Nabiki paused for a moment. "So  we've decided. We'll all be Ranma's fiancees until he, our parents or  one of us decides otherwise. Ukyo and Shampoo won't like it but they  can't do anything about it. At least I hope not. We'll have  to tell our parents and Ranma about this ASAP."</p><p>"Oh, dear. I hope we  don't fight over Ranma like Akane does with Shampoo, Ukyo and  Kodachi. That wouldn't be very nice."</p><p>"I don't fight over  Ranma!" Old habits die an agonizingly long death. Kasumi and  Nabiki simply looked at their youngest sibling. "Uh, um, sorry,   old habit." Hmph! The pervert's probably enjoying himself  with all the attention he's getting. [Sigh.] Why did I have  to fall for someone like him? Life would have been so much simpler.  Now I have my own sisters for rivals.</p><p>"Ah, I don't think  it'll go that far as far as the three of us are concerned. If it  does, be sure to give me or Akane one of your looks."</p><p>"My looks? I don't  know what you mean, Nabiki."</p><p>"You'll see. Anyway  we better go to Ucchan's. We don't want to keep those two waiting too  long."</p><p>Shampoo was the first to  arrive at Ucchan's for the meeting. She left the Nekohanten after  giving her great-grandmother the documents required for her to enroll  at Furinkan and telling her where she was going. She entered to see  Ukyo serving several customers.</p><p>"Nihao, Spa...  Ukyo."</p><p>"Oh, good afternoon,  Shampoo. Have a seat and I'll get to you after I'm done here."</p><p>Shampoo seated herself at  the counter and watched as Ukyo went about making okonomiyakis. She  had been here before but only briefly and mostly to check if her  Airen was here. She took her first good look at the inside of the  restaurant.</p><p>Very nice, clean and  simple. Shampoo had to admit to herself that Ukyo was doing well  despite being on her own. She couldn't imagine how hard it must have  been for her rival. Shampoo knew from first hand experience how hard  it was losing a mother but to lose her father as well at such a young  age? She shook her head, she probably wouldn't know what to do if she  was left all alone in the world. I wonder where her grandparents  or other relatives are. Shampoo couldn't help but admire the  other girl. She had spunk. Ukyo was not only an accomplished martial  artist with a skill level just below Shampoo's, she was even able to  put up her own restaurant at the age of sixteen years. She must  have been selling okonomiyaki since she was little.</p><p>"Earth to Shampoo,  Earth to Shampoo, come in, Shampoo."</p><p>Shampoo blinked then  eeped. "Wha? What?"</p><p>"You were zoning  out, sugar. You've been staring at me for the last ten minutes. You  were starting to get on my nerves."</p><p>"Oh, sorry. I didn't  mean to stare."</p><p>"Fine, fine. So, you  want an okonomiyaki, sugar?" Ukyo indicated the empty grill in  front of her. She served her last customer a couple of minutes  earlier.</p><p>"Uh, sure. What do  you recommend, Ukyo?"</p><p>"Well, what do you  like? Pork, beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables?"</p><p>"Seafood sounds  nice."</p><p>"Coming right up."  Ukyo whipped out the okonomiyaki with her usual flair in less than a  minute. "Here you go, sugar. On the house since this is your  first time to eat here." Ukyo smiled.</p><p>"Thank you."  Shampoo couldn't help but smile back at the chef's genuine smile. She  took her first bite and the smile widened. "This is very good,  Ukyo!"</p><p>"Thanks, sugar. You  know, I think I've never seen you eat one of my okonomiyakis before,  Shampoo."</p><p>"This is actually my  first time to eat an okonomiyaki, Ukyo."</p><p>"Well, I'm honored  to be your first time, Shampoo." Ukyo blinked. "Uh, that  didn't sound right."</p><p>Shampoo giggled. "Aiyah,  customers might get the wrong idea." She then gave Ukyo one of  her patented cute and sultry looks.</p><p>"Uh, ah, yeah, the  perverted ones, at least." Ukyo nervously giggled back. "Is  this really your first time to eat an okonomiyaki?" She asked  to take her mind off the look. Damn. Ranchan's gotta be made of  stone to resist that look. Note to self: Learn to do cute and sexy  look. Shampoo nodded. "Why's that, sugar?"</p><p>"Shampoo shrugged. "I  don't have much time to go out and I don't have many Japanese  friends."</p><p>"Don't you get  lonely? I mean being so far away from your village?"</p><p>"Sometimes, but I  have great-grandmother with me and father comes to visit once in a  while or I go back to visit."</p><p>"Oh." Ukyo  replied a little sadly. Shampoo's answer reminded her of her own  loneliness. At least Shampoo still had some family to keep her  company. She decided to change the subject. "So what's the deal  with those Amazon sisters of yours? Are they really going to go after  Ranchan?"</p><p>[Sigh.] "I hope not.  I hope they find other men for their husbands."</p><p>"But they have  permission to pursue Ranchan if they don't?"</p><p>Shampoo sighed again.  "Yes, the council made Airen an exception to the 'first come,  first serve rule.' It shows how good he is." Sometimes Shampoo  wished Ranma wasn't such a great guy, maybe then she'd have less  competition. Then again she probably wouldn't be interested in him if  he wasn't.</p><p>"Yes, he is that  good. If he wasn't we wouldn't be wasting our time running after  him." Ukyo confirmed.</p><p>"I know. It's just  that it's bad enough with all the other girls. I wish I didn't have  so many rivals for him."</p><p>"I know what you  mean, sugar. It's our dumb luck to meet and fall in love with the  jerk."</p><p>Shampoo laughed a little.  In a way she was talking to someone who understood her perfectly  since the other person was in the exact same situation she was. It  was sort of a bond between them. "Aiyah, it's a curse we both  share."</p><p>"Amen to that,  sugar. So tell me, what are you going to do about your sisters?"</p><p>"I'll try finding  them husbands besides Airen, of course."</p><p>"Yeah, but will you  find enough? Eight of your Amazon sisters are coming after all.</p><p>"It'll be hard but  what's the alternative? I've already listed some males who could  defeat them."</p><p>"Oh? Who?"</p><p>"There's Ryoga,  Mousse, Pantyhose Taro, Copycat Ken, Sotatsu Jikeyin and, uh, Dr.  Tofu."</p><p>"Are you sure about  those guys? Do you think your sisters will even like them? And Dr.  Tofu?"</p><p>"I know but I'm out  of candidates and I'm still short by two. I'm even thinking of  getting my sisters to go after Mr. Tendo."</p><p>Ukyo choked. "Mr.  Tendo? You've got to be kidding!"</p><p>"I know, I know. My  sisters will probably give me the 'Kiss of Death' for doing that but  I'm getting desperate."</p><p>"You can bet on  that, sugar. I'll kill anyone who tries to hitch me with someone like  Mr. Tendo." Ukyo noticed the helpless look on Shampoo. "Don't  worry too much, Shampoo. I'm sure some other guys will turn up.  Ranchan seems to attract challengers all the time. Are you sure your  sisters will like the guys you listed? I mean, they might not like  you fixing them with those guys."</p><p>[Sigh.] "Challengers  aren't the only thing Airen attracts. Unfortunately." The  Amazon champion shook her head. "Well, they won't have a choice  if they get defeated by them. What's bothering me is if my sisters  decide to run after Airen and get defeated one way or another by him  before they get defeated by the others. I just hope Airen can keep  his pride in check and resist their challenges and taunts."</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyo grimaced.  They could see it now. Why? Afraid of a little girl? They  groaned. They prayed Ranchan/Airen would be able to resist those  kind of taunts.</p><p>"That would be a  problem."</p><p>"I know."  [Sigh.] "Why did I have to fall for someone like Airen?"</p><p>"Welcome to the  club, sugar. Speaking of which here comes the others."</p><p>Shampoo turned to see  Akane, Nabiki and Kasumi entering Ucchan's.</p><p>"About time you guys  showed up."</p><p>"It's nice to see  you too, Ukyo." Nabiki replied drily.</p><p>"Oops, sorry, didn't  mean to be rude. So have a seat or would you guys rather sit at one  of the tables?"</p><p>"I think it would be  better if we sit at one of the tables."</p><p>"Okay, you guys like  an okonomiyaki before we talk?"</p><p>"Anything would be  fine, Ukyo."</p><p>After a couple of minutes  Ukyo joined the others at one of the tables and laid freshly cooked  okonomiyakis in front of the Tendos.</p><p>"So, is there  something we should know?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"We decided that we  three will be Ranma's fiancees until he, our parents or one of us  decides otherwise." Nabiki said. The sisters decided that it  would be best for Nabiki to do the talking.</p><p>"What?" Ukyo  and Shampoo stiffened and stared incredulously at the three sisters.</p><p>"I said..."</p><p>"We heard what you  said! You have got to be kidding me!"</p><p>"No, we're not  kidding."</p><p>"No way! It's bad  enough as it is!"</p><p>"We know that  but..."</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"Oh, my. Shouting  and interrupting is not very nice. We won't be able to discuss  anything if we do that."</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyo stared  bug-eyed at Kasumi. They tried to maintain their anger, they really  did, but one look at the innocent and sincere face of the eldest  Tendo sister melted away their anger. They sagged back into their  seats.</p><p>Damn it! It's not  fair!</p><p>"Thank you, Shampoo,  Ukyo. I'm sure we'll be able to discuss more if we do it in a polite  manner."</p><p>"Okay, okay. So  what's this all about?"</p><p>"Like I said, we  decided that the three of us will be Ranma's fiancees until Ranma,  our parents or one of us decides otherwise."</p><p>"You can't do that!"</p><p>"Yes, we can. Daddy  and Genma only agreed that one of us marries his son. They didn't  specify who."</p><p>"That's not fair!"</p><p>"Look, if it'll make  you two feel any better, it's not one-hundred percent certain yet. We  still have to talk to our parents and Ranma about it."</p><p>"Why? Why all of the  sudden?"</p><p>"Believe me, we  didn't see it coming ourselves."</p><p>"So why?"</p><p>"Short version is  that when Ranma left our home yesterday we realized how much he meant  to each of us."</p><p>"Are you serious?"</p><p>"Very serious.  Nothing's better at making you realize what you have than losing it.  Or almost losing it in this case."</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyo looked at  the Tendo sisters then at each other. The two sighed deeply. Two  more competitors to deal with. What the heck does Ranchan/Airen have  that attracts girls like crazy? They looked up to the heavens and  implored to whatever deities were listening. Please, please no  more. I promise to be a good girl from now on. They turned back  their attention to the Tendo sisters. It was then they noticed the  glow on the faces of Kasumi and Nabiki. They blinked.</p><p>"Okay, I can believe  that. Losing Ranma ten years ago was one of the worst days of my  life. So that's the reason why Kasumi brought Ranchan lunch wearing  something she wouldn't normally wear?" Damn, if that's  going to be the competition I'm in trouble.</p><p>Kasumi blushed and nodded.  It seemed everyone noticed the dress she wore.</p><p>"Also the reason why  Akane was nice to Ranchan today? I didn't see her pound Ranchan even  once. She didn't even forced him to eat what she cooked!"  Double damn, if she's going to start acting like a girl...</p><p>It was Akane's turn to  blush and nod.</p><p>"What about you?"</p><p>"Uh, well, I..."  Nabiki uncharacteristically stuttered. She blushed and looked away.</p><p>"Well if the Ice  Queen's stuttering, blushing like a schoolgirl with a crush and can't  look me straight in the eye then it must be _very_ serious."  Now that's something I never thought I'd see. Damn. If Ranchan /  Airen can have that effect on someone like Nabiki... Note to self:  Keep Ranchan / Airen away from girls.</p><p>"I don't like this."  Shampoo simply stated.</p><p>"You and me both,  sugar." Ukyo massaged her temples. "Here we were talking  about how to prevent Shampoo's Amazon sisters from chasing after  Ranchan and you three decided to add yourselves. Are you sure about  this?"</p><p>The three sisters nodded.</p><p>"Does Ranchan know?"</p><p>"Not yet but we  intend to tell him and our parents as soon as possible."</p><p>"If he doesn't like  it?"</p><p>Kasumi and Nabiki's faces  fell, the glow gone . "Then... then I guess we won't be his  fiancees."</p><p>Ukyo and Shampoo blinked.  They didn't expect that kind of reaction. Kasumi and Nabiki liked  Ranma that much? They felt a little guilty as they looked at the two  sisters' crestfallen faces. Akane gave them a glare before reaching  over to grasp her sisters' hands.</p><p>"I'm sure Ranma  wouldn't feel that way, Nabiki, Kasumi. He'll be surprised that's  all." That's putting it mildly. He'll either turn to stone  or go into a coma. Probably both.</p><p>"Do... do you think  so, Akane?" Oh, I hope Ranma doesn't take it too badly. I  don't know what I'll do if he does. "Maybe I shouldn't go  through with it, Akane. I... I don't want to be a bother to Ranma."</p><p>Akane's eyes widened.  "Don't say that, Kasumi! I'm sure Ranma will not feel like  that, sis. We just have to tell him in a way that wouldn't pressure  him too much." Although I'm sure he'll freak out no matter  what we say.</p><p>"Thanks, Akane. I  needed that." Nabiki didn't know why but she felt very  vulnerable now. She didn't like the feeling but she couldn't help  it. Damn, I've got to get my emotions under control. She  composed herself with some effort. "So that's the situation  now."</p><p>Ukyo and Shampoo felt the  world spinning way out of control. They did not like it one teeny,  weeny bit. They were about to voice out more objections when the door  to the shop slid open with a loud slam. The five girls looked at who  could be rude enough to open the door that way and saw someone they  instinctively didn't like.</p><p>"Bakusozoku."  breathed Ukyo.</p><p>Ranma-girl ran as fast as  she could across the rooftops after the fleeing Kodachi and was only  slowly catching up as the confused girl was running faster than Ranma  had ever seen her run before. She had been chasing the leotard-clad  girl for more than fifteen minutes now and Ranma was getting worried.  The gymnast did not seem to go in any particular direction and they  were entering the parts of Tokyo where the buildings were getting  taller and taller. Even now Ranma estimated they were already some  fifteen stories high and he could see some skyscrapers looming  several blocks away. They were martial artists and their sturdy  bodies could take some punishment but even she knew there were limits  to the physical abuse their bodies could handle. Ranma doubled her  effort as Kodachi continued hopping from one building to the next  higher one.</p><p>Kodachi ran. She ran as  fast as her slender, athletic legs could carry her. Kodachi cried.  She cried as hard as she could ever remember. Her tears blinded her  but she did not care. She only wanted to get away, as far away as  possible from the truth. She was confused, her mind a jumble of  agonized and confused thoughts.</p><p>The man she loved more  than anyone else, for whom she would give up everything, to whom she  would give anything. How could he be a half-woman? It couldn't be!  He was the epitomy of manliness! She could still remember those  strong arms, hard chest, broad shoulders, handsome face, blue-grey  eyes, jet-black hair, the devilish grin. How could he be the same  person as that... that hated redhead?</p><p>And yet how could she deny  what she saw and felt? He had changed in front of her, she had felt  that big callused hand change into a soft, slender one. She felt him  change in her arms.</p><p>No!</p><p>He was her hero, her  knight in shining armor. The man-among-men who would keep her safe  from any harm. The man who would protect her, who would give up his  own life to shelter her. How could he ever be less than a complete  man?</p><p>Ranma began to breath  easier as she was now within a few dozen meters of Kodachi. She would  catch up with the other girl in another several minutes. What she  would do once she did she hadn't planned yet.</p><p>One thing at a time,  Ranma. First catch up then figure out what to do.</p><p>Ranma was brought out of  her thoughts when she felt a drop hit her cheek.</p><p>Damn it! I don't need  it to rain now!</p><p>Ranma looked down at the  concrete ground some thirty or so stories down.</p><p>One slip and it's a  long way down.</p><p>She looked up and was  surprised to see a cloudless afternoon sky, not even those stray rain  clouds that seemed to follow her everywhere.</p><p>Now where the hell did  that drop come from?</p><p>She shrugged it off as she  looked back at her quarry. She could see Kodachi clearly now and was  surprised to see the girl wipe her eyes now and then.</p><p>Is she crying? If  there was one thing Ranma didn't like to see it was a girl crying.  She would do almost anything to prevent a girl from crying. What's  she crying about? Ranma wondered as she continued closing in on  the gymnast.</p><p>Fujiwara led his  bakusozoku gang through the streets of Nerima, ignoring the  disapproving stares from the bystanders. At twenty-two years of age  he was the oldest in his gang with the longest experience as a biker  having joined his first gang when he was only sixteen after dropping  out of high school. He was also the biggest, standing at six-feet  flat and weighing around ninety kilos, most of it muscle. It was  because of those two attributes that he was the leader of this group.</p><p>The roar from their  Kawasaki big bikes rudely interrupted the daily lives of the  desperately peace-seeking residents of Nerima. Fujiwara and his gang  were in Nerima for a reason. A war with a rival bakusozoku gang was  not going well for them and Fujiwara and his gang were looking for  new areas to add to their territory for more shake down money and  they heard Nerima was unclaimed territory.</p><p>Fujiwara spotted Ucchan's  okonomiyaki shop and smiled. Heh, long time since I've had one of  those. It was also as good as any place to start staking his  claim. He signaled his thirty or so followers and headed for the  seemingly innocent store.</p><p>Fujiwara slid the door  open with a slam and entered with four of his lieutenants in tow to  see the restaurant deserted except for five girls at one of the  tables looking curiously at him at him. He ignored them and went  directly to the counter and banged loudly on it.</p><p>"Where's the  goddamned cook?"</p><p>"Yes? May I help  you?"</p><p>Fujiwara turned to face  one of the girls from the table. It was then he noticed that she was  wearing an okonomiyaki chef's uniform. He smiled crookedly. Damn,  she's cute.</p><p>"You the cook here?"</p><p>"Yeah. What can I do  for you?"</p><p>"Well, me and the  boys are hungry. You and your okonomiyakis any good?"</p><p>"They're the best in  Japan."</p><p>"Best, eh?" He  sat at one one the stools at the counter followed by his henchmen on  both sides. "Let's try them then."</p><p>Ukyo looked at him. She  didn't like him or his friends one bit. They looked nothing but  trouble. She thought about asking them to leave but shrugged a moment  later. A customer was a customer and she decided she could take him  if he caused trouble. Not even a martial artist by the way he  moves. She went behind the counter.</p><p>"So what do you  like?"</p><p>"Five of your  specials."</p><p>Ukyo had their orders done  and in front of them in less than two minutes. Fujiwara had to admit  he was impressed.</p><p>"You got some nice  moves, babe."</p><p>"Name's Kounji."  Ukyo didn't like being called 'babe' by the biker. She felt it  demeaned her unlike when Hiroshi, Daisuke or any of the other boys at  Furinkan called her that.</p><p>"Whatever."  Fujiwara took a bite and he smiled widely. "Damn, babe, you  weren't kidding when you said you were the best in Japan."</p><p>"Thank you and I  said the name's Kounji."</p><p>Fujiwara ignored Ukyo's  reply. "So, got any plans for later, babe?"</p><p>Ukyo frowned. "Me  and my friends are talking."</p><p>Fujiwara glanced back at  the table where the four other girls were sitting looking at them and  did a double-take. Damn, they're all babes!</p><p>"Heh, maybe you and  your girlfriends would like to have some fun with some real men?"</p><p>"Sorry, but we have  some important things to talk about." Besides, don't see  any 'real men'.</p><p>"Hey, that's not a  nice way to talk to your boyfriend."</p><p>"Who made you my  boyfriend?" Jackass!</p><p>"I take what I want,  babe, and right now I want you." Fujiwara reached over the  counter to caress Ukyo's left arm. "You treat me right and I'll  make sure your nice little shop gets all the business you want."</p><p>Ukyo looked at the hand  sliding up and down her arm then looked straight into Fujiwara's  eyes. Her eyes bored into his. "Take your hands off me right  now."</p><p>Fujiwara was momentarily  taken back by the intensity in the girl's eyes and voice. He was not  used to being talked back to by girls. He shrugged it off and  continued caressing Ukyo's arm. "You don't seem to understand,  babe. I can make or break you so you better treat me nicely."  He gripped Ukyo's arm to emphasize his point.</p><p>Unnoticed by the bikers  Shampoo and Akane took stances a few steps from them. Ukyo gave no  indication she saw them move into position.</p><p>"I warned you,  jackass." Ukyo took hold of Fujiwara's right hand's thumb with  her own right hand and twisted hard causing the biker to yelp in  surprise and pain, making him lose his grip. He jerked back his arm.</p><p>"Why you, bitch!"  He swung in an attempt to slap Ukyo.</p><p>Ukyo caught the arm in  mid-swing and jumped over the counter while still holding the arm to  kick the henchman sitting to the left of his boss, who was rising to  his feet, square in the chest slamming him into the wall dazed. In  one smooth motion Ukyo lightly landed on her feet and turned pulling  Fujiwara along until he stood in front of the other biker coming to  his aid. The gang boss was still trying to get his bearings when a  nasty palm strike to his chest blew him off his feet and into the  henchman behind him causing both to fly out of the open door onto the  street among their startled gangmates.</p><p>The gang  members stared in shock at their fallen boss.</p><p>"What the fuck are  you staring at? Get the fucking bitches!" Fujiwara snarled at  them snapping them out of their shock. They started towards the  doorway when the remaining three members inside mimicked  their boss' exit and crashed into them. They tumbled in a mess of  arms and legs. They looked up to see three extremely cute but very  pissed off teen-aged girls step out of the restaurant. There was a  collective blink as they tried to associate the girls with the  beating they just saw their gang leaders take.</p><p>Shampoo, Akane, Nabiki  and Kasumi sat looking as Ukyo rose to accommodate the new arrivals.  Nabiki and Kasumi had apprehensive looks while Shampoo and Akane  evaluated the danger levels. When one of the bikers touched Ukyo,  Shampoo and Akane shared a look and rose quietly to take stances  within striking distance of the threats. They followed Ukyo's lead  and made their moves to defend Ukyo's blindside as the chef leapt  over the counter. They each grabbed a biker that were sitting to  right of the boss by their shoulders as they rose to help their  comrade, startling them. They spun them around and before the bikers  knew what was happening Akane and Shampoo gave them a haymaker to  their solar plexuses bowing them over followed by knees to the jaws  snapping their heads back up and rendering them semi-conscious. The  two girls held their respective opponent up by the collars while they  waited for Ukyo to pick up the gangmember she kicked in the chest.  They lined up the three and in unison front-kicked them out the door.  After telling Nabiki and Kasumi to stay inside, the three avenging  angels stepped outside to confront the rest of the biker gang.</p><p>Fujiwara glared with  murder in his eyes at the three girls who dared defy him. He stared  daggers at the Kounji girl who humiliated him. He stood and faced the  three.</p><p>"That was a big  mistake, bitch. I tried to be friendly but you throw it back to my  face. Now you and your girlfriends are gonna pay and I'm gonna enjoy  collecting." He grabbed his crotch in a suggestive manner. Oh  yes, he was going to enjoy himself before handing them over to his  gang. His gang members, outnumbering the girls eight to one, were  already surrounding the three cutting off any escape. They brandished  baseball bats, iron pipes and knives</p><p>"Bring it on,  asshole." Ukyo dared him.</p><p>"Get them!"  Fujiwara screamed and his gang rushed in to beat the three girls into  submission.</p><p>Akane, who was on the left  of Ukyo, smiled. She hasn't had an honest-to-goodness gang-bang since  the hentai horde decided to call it quits. "Remember not to  hurt them too much, okay?"</p><p>"Sure, sugar, but  leave the jerkface to me. I owe him some major pain for touching me."</p><p>"Does breaking their  bones count as hurting them too much?" Shampoo, who stood to  Ukyo's right, asked.</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"Oh, good."  With that the three leaped into the free-for-all.</p><p>Ukyo ducked under the bat  of the first punk biker she fought who misjudged his swing and hit  his friend, who was charging to his right, in the face breaking the  nose. Ukyo didn't give him time to recover as she gave him an  uppercut that lifed him clean off his feet. She grabbed the bat and  used it to block the lead pipe a third gang member tried to strike  her with then pirouetted to get into his  defense to deliver a ringing hammer blow to the side of his head. She  twisted to the side to avoid the knife slash from a fourth opponent  then jumped over a leg sweep and over a fifth gang member. She  twisted in mid-air much as she had seen Ranma do until she was  vertically upside down over the one who tried a leg sweep and gave a  vicious one-two combination to the surprised face looking up at her.  She landed in time to see another bat coming and bent over to avoid  it. She continued her motion to flip over the one she just knocked  out and grab the baseball bat she dropped. She did a leg split to  duck under another knife slash and used the bat to hit the guy in the  crotch with a sickening splat. The knife-wielder dropped the knife  and bent over to clutch his abused balls. Ukyo planted her hands on  the ground and did a spinning hand stand with legs spread to hit the  knife wielder and the second batter in the sides of their heads. She  stopped her spin and stood with bat in hand to face her remaining two  opponents who had lost their enthusiasm to fight. It was only when  Fujiwara shouted and pushed them did they charge swinging their pipes  wildly. Ukyo calmly waited for them to get near then rushed in to  jumped easily over their weapons to do a leg split in mid-air and  kick them both in the temples. The two crumpled behind Ukyo as she  landed to face Fujiwara.</p><p>Akane easily caught the  pipe her first opponent tried to swing at her much to the surprise of  the biker. She gave a tug and pulled the guy towards her. She gave a  snap kick that sent the biker flying into two of his gangmates. Akane  used the pipe to block a bat and then stepped in to give an elbow to  the throat of the batter. She stepped sideways to avoid a downward  swing of another pipe then turned to plant a side kick to the side of  the abdomen. Akane continued the twirl to avoid a knife stab and  struck the knife wielder with the pipe in his back. She stopped to  see the two bikers she had kicked her first opponent into charging  her. She decided offense was the best defense and charged the closest  one. She jumped over his bat and delivered a flying side-kick to his  face. She quickly turned and jumped at the second guy who was still  turning to face her to hit him with a back hand blow to the back of  the head. Akane landed and twisted just in time to avoid being  skewered by a knife. She grabbed the hand and twisted the knife arm  behind the back of the biker. She then used the knife wielder as a  shield against his fellow biker who tried to hit her with a pipe. The  man yowled in pain and grabbed his right upper limb as he felt the  arm break from the impact. The pipe man jumped back in surprise  giving Akane the opening to connect with a jumping axe kick to the  top of his head. Her last opponent dropped like a sack of potatoes.  She turned to see Ukyo facing off with the jerkface.</p><p>Shampoo was enjoying  herself, a fight always gave her a rush. She knew she could easily  overpower her present opponents with her skill in the martial arts  but it wouldn't be a challenge. Instead she used her speed and  agility to dodge and weave between every slash, swing and thrust of  her adversaries and used her Amaguriken speed against pressure points  to disable them. The first she paralyzed his right arm, the second  his right leg, the third both arms, the fourth (being left handed)  his left arm, the fifth both legs, the sixth she turned into a  paraplegic, seventh and eigth she disrupted their sense of balance.  The two staggered around like drunks. She turned and smiled at her  helpless antagonists and posed to highlight her  killer body.</p><p>"So who wants to  play some more?" Shampoo purred sexily.</p><p>The eight tried to shake  their heads as vigorously as possible. They were still in shock that  someone as full bodied as her could move so fast they couldn't see  what she was doing. They certainly felt it however.</p><p>"You're no fun."  Shampoo pouted prettily. She thought they would give her a bigger  challenge. Idiot males! She snorted in disgust, stomped  angrily to each one and proceeded to tap their sleep spot. Shampoo  was about to turn around when a mischievous thought entered her head.  She again went around to tap some more pressure points. This  should teach you a lesson you'll never forget. She grinned evilly  when she imagined the men's reactions when they realize they wouldn't  be able to get it up for the next several weeks. She finished in time  to see Ukyo facing the leader who was now backing away. Shampoo  quickly went behind Fujiwara and was soon joined by Akane who  replaced her pipe with an aluminum baseball bat. Shampoo shrugged and  picked one up as well. It made a nice club to beat the stuffing out  of the jerkface.</p><p>It was over in less than  five minutes. At the end Fujiwara's gangmen lay sprawled across the  sidewalk and street while their women looked bug-eyed with jaws down  on the pavement in astonishment at the three girls.</p><p>Ukyo brandished the  baseball bat she was holding and stalked the backpedalling Fujiwara.  She gave a snort and smirked as she saw the fear in his eyes. Feh!  Bullies, they're the same everywhere.</p><p>"You were saying  something about making me pay, scum bag?"</p><p>"Uh, it-it was a  j-joke, r-really." The gang leader tried to bluff his way out  as he continued to back away. He stopped as he bumped into something.   He turned his head to see a baseball bat being poked into his back  by the short haired girl.</p><p>"Uh-uh. Wasn't funny  and you haven't paid for your okonomiyaki yet." Akane informed  him.</p><p>"Uh, ri-right, of  course. How stu-stupid of me. Here, take my wa-wallet."  Fujiwara took out his wallet and extended it respectfully with  trembling fingers towards the chef. He didn't like the looks on the  three baseball bat-toting girls.</p><p>"Don't mind if I do,  scum bag." Ukyo took a quick look into the wallet. "Not  bad, scum bag. You don't mind me calling you scum  bag, do you, scum bag?" Ukyo poked her baseball bat under  Fujiwara's nose. Fujiwara sweated and gulped.</p><p>"Y-you can ca-call  me a-anything y-you like, Kounji-san, I-I don't mind. I-I deserve  i-it." Fujiwara remembered some of the manners his mother  taught him. Just leave me in one piece please. He was  resigned to being beaten. He beat other people for less reason. He  just prayed he was still in one piece after the beating.</p><p>Ukyo switched the bat to  her left hand. "Hey, Shampoo, got one of your throwing knives  with you?" Fujiwara almost swallowed his tongue, gums, teeth  and lips at the question.</p><p>"U-uh, i-is thth-at  r-really ne-necessary, K-Ko-ounji-san?"</p><p>"Shut up, scum bag.  I wasn't talking to you." Fujiwara clamped his mouth shut.</p><p>"I always carry  some. Here." Shampoo handed over one of her shiny and wicked  looking throwing knives.</p><p>"Nice and sharp,  just the way I like them." The knife glinted under the setting  sun. Fujiwara sweated at the sight.</p><p>[Slash!]</p><p>Something flashed and he  saw his life pass before his eyes. "AAAAAAAIIIIIIEEEEEE!"  Fujiwara screamed like a little school girl.</p><p>"Shut up, scum bag.  I haven't touched you _yet_. You can scream all you want later. Or  maybe I should cut your tongue out." That shut Fujiwara up  fast.</p><p>Fujiwara looked down with  bulging eyes at his body. Sure enough there weren't any blood but his  pants were now down around his ankles and he was standing in only his  boxers. He wet his boxers as realization dawned on him. Shampoo  snickered.</p><p>"N-no, pl-please,  n-not th-that! A-anyth-thing bu-but th-that!" he squeaked.</p><p>"Not what, scum  bag?"</p><p>"Pl-please d-don't  c-cut m-my d-dick a-and ba-balls off!"</p><p>"You mean this?"  Ukyo dropped the baseball bat and grabbed his crotch with her left  hand. She squeezed hard. "You ain't losing much, scum bag."</p><p>"Fujiwara's eyes bulged  even more at the pain. Shampoo snickered harder. Akane tried not to  blush too much.</p><p>"Now listen up, scum  bag. I don't want to see you or any of your gang here again. Come  here again and you'll lose more than your pathetic dick and balls.  Understand?" Ukyo waved the knife under his nose. Fujiwara  nodded his head enthusiastically. Ukyo squeezed harder. "I  didn't hear you, scum bag."</p><p>"Fujiwara's eyes almost  popped out of their sockets. "Y-yes, K-Ko-ounji-san! Y-you  won't s-see me or any of m-my men ever a-again!" He squeaked  several octaves higher.</p><p>"Now beat it before  we change our minds and cut all of your dicks and balls off."  Ukyo let go and stepped back while Shampoo quickly tapped the man's  erectile dysfunction point. She snickered again and grinned at Ukyo's  and Akane's questioning looks. "I'll explain over there."  She whispered.</p><p>Ukyo, Akane and Shampoo  walked to the front of her shop and watched as Fujiwara and the women  of his gang scramble around to revive their men and leave with their  tails between their legs.</p><p>"So what did you do  to him, Shampoo?"</p><p>"Oh, I just gave him  a reminder not to come back here."</p><p>"What kind of  reminder?"</p><p>"Oh, he won't be  able to get an erection for at least two months."</p><p>Ukyo and Akane gasped then  giggled. "You didn't?"</p><p>"Yes, I did."</p><p>"You're evil, you  know that?" The three turned to look at the gang leader. They  snickered louder. He was in for a frustrating two months.</p><p>When the last Bakusozoku  were out of sight the onlookers gave a loud cheer to the three girls.  It was times like these that the residents of Nerima remembered why  they tolerated the super powered martial artists in their midst. The  yakuza and other criminals didn't dare step into their ward and the  police were just as happy to let things be. Too bad the girls didn't  beat the crap out of the gang leader. It would have been  entertaining. If they only knew what Shampoo did, they would have  pitied the man. The crowd dispersed soon after.</p><p>"Well, that was  fun." Akane said. "Haven't had a workout like that in a  long time."</p><p>"I know what you  mean, sugar."</p><p>Shampoo snorted. "Bah!  They were pathetic. I didn't even break a sweat."</p><p>"Still it was nice  to kick their butt."</p><p>"Yes, it's always  nice to show stupid males not to underestimate women."</p><p>"Well, I'm glad you  three had fun." Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo turned to see Nabiki  stepping out of the restaurant followed by Kasumi. "Any of you  got hurt?"</p><p>"They couldn't even  touch us."</p><p>"That's good. I  called Ranma's house but Auntie said he was out. She said she'd send  him over as soon as he gets back."</p><p>"What did you call  him for? We can take care of ourselves, you know."</p><p>"I know that but I  like making sure. Anyway, Auntie was worried so she's sending him  over as soon as he gets back. I also called the Nekohanten and Elder  Cologne should..."</p><p>"I am already here,  child. Thank you for informing me of the fight. I am glad all of you  are safe."</p><p>"How long have you  been here, great-grandmother?"</p><p>"Long enough to see  the three of you humble the leader. I was impressed by the way you  handled him. I am certain he and his gang will not be back for  revenge."</p><p>"Oh, my! What a nice  motorcycle!" Five heads swiveled to the direction of the squeal  to see the eldest Tendo daughter looking to their left. Kasumi had  followed Nabiki out of the restaurant and upon seeing Akane, Shampoo  and Ukyo unharmed turned her attention to their surroundings. The  five followed her gaze until they saw the object of her interest.</p><p>It was a big Kawasaki easy  rider. The chrome and black paint shone brightly under the street  light it was parked under. In the gang's scramble to leave, it was  left behind by the biker who had his arm broken. The key glinted  invitingly in the ignition. Akane, Nabiki, Shampoo and Ukyo blinked  and looked at each other. The Bakusozoku gang probably isn't coming  back. Then one thought popped into their heads.</p><p>"DIBS!"</p><p>The four scrambled to get  to the big bike first. In their haste and attempt to be the first  they grabbed, pushed, pulled and tripped each other until they were a  mass of arms and legs on the street.</p><p>"Its mine!"</p><p>"Like hell it is!"</p><p>"Get off me!"</p><p>"Let go!"</p><p>"No way!"</p><p>"Watch where you're  putting your hands!"</p><p>"Hey! Watch where  you're stepping!"</p><p>"Stop pulling my  hair!"</p><p>"Oh, my! This seat  is so comfortable."</p><p>"Indeed it is,  child." cackled the reply.</p><p>Akane, Nabiki, Shampoo and  Ukyo looked up from where they were entangled on the street to see  Kasumi sitting sidesaddle on the motorcycle with Cologne sitting  behind her. They blink, blink and scrambled to their feet.</p><p>"No fair!"</p><p>Cologne inclined her head  at them. "No fair?"</p><p>"You two cheated!"</p><p>"Cheated? How so?"</p><p>"You waited until we  couldn't move!"</p><p>"That's cheating?"</p><p>"Great-grandmother,  you don't need a motorcycle!"</p><p>"True, Shampoo but  am I not entitled to enjoy myself once in a while? The same can be  said for Kasumi here." Cologne grinned to needle them while  Kasumi just smiled innocently at them.</p><p>"But, but, but..."</p><p>"Well, you can only  blame yourselves why Kasumi managed to get to the motorcycle first.  As the saying goes 'first come, first serve' but I'm sure Kasumi is  more than willing to share the motorcycle."</p><p>Kasumi was a little  unsure. She didn't really want the motorcycle. The only reason she  went and sat on it was out of curiousity, the seat did looked  comfortable from afar after all. But if it stopped the girls from  fighting over it then she supposed it would be for the best if she  'owned' it. She smiled at the Amazon Matriarch. "Of course,  Elder Cologne."</p><p>"See? Now you five  work it out among yourselves. All I want is a joyride now and then."  Cologne cackled loudly. "If you will excuse me, I need to get  back to the Nekohanten. There's no telling what the slacker has been  up to. I'll expect you back soon, Shampoo." With that the  Amazon Matriarch pogoed off.</p><p>The four girls approached  Kasumi on the motorcycle.</p><p>"So how do we do  this?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"First let's get it  off the street. Ukyo, do you have enough space behind your restaurant  for this?" Nabiki replied.</p><p>"I don't think so."</p><p>"I thought so. Look  if you two" Nabiki indicated Shampoo and Ukyo. "don't  object I suggest we park it in our home. It has the biggest space."</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyo nodded.  It was logical. "As long as we get equal time with it."</p><p>"No problem. The way  I figure it we need to cooperate to make this legally ours. I'll  check the ownership first thing tomorrow." The four other  girls nodded. If there was someone who knew how to do things legally,  it was Nabiki. "Akane, do you think you can push it home? It's  kinda heavy."</p><p>"No problem, sis."</p><p>"Okay, that settles  it for the bike for now. So do you two want to continue our talk?"</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyo shared a  look. They sighed and came to a silent understanding. "Look, we  don't like it but we promised Auntie we wouldn't fight so we'll go  with it for now until you three can talk with Ranma and your parents.  We'll see what Auntie thinks about it at the slumber party. Fair  enough?"</p><p>"We can live with  that. So you two want to come along and bring our new baby home?"</p><p>"You bet we do,  sugar."</p><p>Shampoo smiled  mischievously. "Of course. I want to know how it feels to have  a powerful machine pumping between my legs." She said  lasciviously then snickered as she watched the four other girls turn   red. "Why are you all red? You must have very naughty minds."  Then laughed out loud as the four turned even redder.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened in  alarm as she saw where Kodachi was headed. They were already some  sixty stories up with the rooftops farther apart and Kodachi was  running towards a chasm of more than twenty-five meters to the next  roof top.</p><p>"Kodachi, look out!"  She shouted to warn the girl. Damn it, Kodachi, look where you're  going!</p><p>Whatever the reason, Ranma  saw that Kodachi wasn't looking or listening. With a final burst of  speed Ranma covered the final few meters between them and jumped to  tackle the other girl to the rooftop before Kodachi could make her  next, and probably last, leap. The two tumbled to the roof in a  tangle of arms and legs. They struggled and rolled for several meters  before Ranma was able move on top, straddle Kodachi's body and pin  Kodachi's arms to her sides with her legs.</p><p>"Let go of me, you  bitch!" Kodachi snarled once she saw who had dared lay a finger  on her person. Her emotions causied her to use the more pedestrian  words. She struggled to free herself.</p><p>Ranma blinked at the  hatred in the words. Whoa, girl. "Is that any way to  thank someone who just saved your life?"</p><p>Kodachi's eyes flashed.  "Kodachi Kuno does not need to be saved by one such as you!"  She struggled some more, her movements making her full, firm body do  some interesting contortions which wasn't lost on Ranma . Girl-Ranma  shook her head to remove the image.</p><p>"Whatever, Kodachi.  I came here to help you."</p><p>"You? Help me?"  Kodachi suddenly wrapped her legs around the surprised Ranma's waist  and pulled the smaller girl off. "I would rather be helped by  the devil himself!" The two scrambled to their feet to face off  several meters from each other, Kodachi bringing out her ribbon while  Ranma assumed a defensive stance.</p><p>Kodachi struck fast and  furious with her ribbon, her emotions fueling her, the speed of the  attack breaking the sound barrier and catching Ranma unprepared.  Ranma yelped in pain as a red welt emerged on her left upper arm.</p><p>"Damn, Kodachi, that  hurt!" Ranma rubbed the sore spot.</p><p>"I will do more than  hurt you, witch, for daring to imply that my Ranma-darling is a  half-woman and for bewitching his mother with your lies."  Kodachi replied in a low, serious tone, leaving no doubts as to her  intentions.</p><p>"Damn it, Kodachi! I  _am_ Ranma! Whoa!" Ranma dodged as Kodachi snapped the ribbon  towards her. The red-head had to duck and weave as the gymnast  followed her with several snaps of the weapon.</p><p>"Silence! I will not  have you spread these lies!"</p><p>"Damn it, Kodachi!  What will it take to make ya believe it? I changed right in front of  ya! Ya even held my goddamned hand! Yer not as stupid or idiotic as  yer brother!" Ranma had to evade some more ribbon attacks, the  last of which caught her on her right thigh. Fuck! Can't dodge  forever! I have to get rid of that damned ribbon. She quickly  massaged the part.</p><p>"Never! I shall  never believe it! I shall expose it for the fabrication it is!"  Kodachi continued her supersonic ribbon attacks, the ribbon invisible  to the naked eye.</p><p>"Damn it! Kodachi,  stop before someone gets hurt!"</p><p>"Ohohohohohohoho!"  The malevolence in the laugh sent chills down the pig-tailed girl's  spine. "I will do much more than hurt you!"</p><p>Damn, she's losing it!  Gotta slow that ribbon down somehow. Her eyes roamed around to  look for something to throw in the ribbon's path while keeping the  ribbon in view. There! She saw a metallic object lying on the  roof top a couple of meters away and dodged towards it. Gotta  time it right... Now! She kicked the object into the path of the  ribbon. It was sliced cleanly in half but the resistance was enough  to decrease the ribbon's speed to allow Ranma to catch it with her  right hand. They settled into a tug of war.</p><p>"Damn it, Kodachi,  will ya just listen!"</p><p>"Never! I shall  never listen to the likes of you!" Kodachi tugged hard to free  her ribbon. What the two did not see was the small tear the metal  object's sharp side had cut in the ribbon. The ribbon suddenly  snapped in two causing the two girls to stumble backwards. Ranma fell  on her butt to watch with horror Kodachi tumble with eyes wide open  over the railing running around the roof and fall backwards towards  the hard concrete street some two-hundred meters below.</p><p>"RANMA!"  Kodachi screamed in cold fear as she fell over the edge. She screamed  for the boy who saved her and captured her heart that night many  months ago. She did not want to die. She may have a demented mind but  a death wish was not a part of it.</p><p>"Kodachi!"  Ranma quickly ran to the side and looked over to see Kodachi already  several meters below and a few meters too far from the building's  wall to control her fall. A quick look and Ranma decided on a course  of action. Only one way to save her. Ranma quickly leapt over  the railing and _ran_ down the side of the building, blowing past a  two man window cleaning crew packing up for the day. One of the crew  spat out the tea he was drinking as he saw the redhead run past.</p><p>"Whoa! What the hell  was that?" He and his partner looked down to see a girl with  ponytail in a black and green leotard falling as if in slow motion  towards the street and a red blur streaking along the side of the  building rapidly catching up to the falling girl.</p><p>Kodachi couldn't believe  her eyes as she saw her despised rival run past her. Her eyes  further widened as the red head stopped and planted her feet on a  window ledge a dozen meters below her and leap upwards to catch  Kodachi in her arms.</p><p>"What are you  doing?" Kodachi screeched.</p><p>"What does it look  like I'm doing? I'm trying ta save ya!"</p><p>"NO! Only  Ranma-darling can save me!" Kodachi struggled in the arms that  cradled her.</p><p>"Will ya quit  moving! I'm trying ta concentrate here!" Ranma needed to focus  her attention on the other building she was aiming for, some  twenty-five meters away across the wide avenue. She knew she was  stretching it, even with her superior physical condition she knew she  could barely cover the distance. She focused more of her chi to her  legs for the next jump. Damn! Where's hot water when you need  some? She hoped by making jumps from one building to another she  could slow their descent enough to be survivable.</p><p>"Unhand me! Only my  darling Ranma can touch me!"</p><p>"Damn it, Kodachi!  How many times do I hafta tell ya? I _am_ Ranma!"</p><p>"Never! You can  never be...?" Angry eyes turned to wonder as Ranma passed  through the tea spat out by the window cleaning man earlier and  transformed back into a boy. Familiar sensations passed through  Kodachi's body and she was brought back several months back to the  night she first met the love of her life. The strong arms cradling  her, the hard chest she was pressed against, the broad shoulders, the  kind and handsome face. There was no doubt who held her.  "Ranma-darling?"</p><p>Thank God for small  favors! Ranma sighed as he felt the transformation. "Finally,  d'ya believe me now?" He planted his feet against the wall of  the opposite building and leapt back towards the first building with  more confidence now that he was back in his stronger male form.</p><p>Kodachi gazed in awe and  wonder at her beloved. She felt safe in his arms. No one can harm  her. No one can hurt her. No one can take her loved ones away as long  as she was with her Ranma-darling. She wrapped her arms tighter  around that neck she longed so much to kiss, snuggled closer, laid  her head on the shoulders and closed her eyes in contentment, her  fear of falling to death totally forgotten. Surely a mere two-hundred  meter fall was nothing for her Ranma. She briefly toyed with the idea  of using a paralyzing or sleeping powder on her knight in shining  armor. Maybe later when we're on the ground.</p><p>Fortunately for the  rescuer of the damsel in distress, physical exhaustion combined with  the sudden lost of adrenaline-pumping stimuli allowed sleepiness to  overcome Kodachi.</p><p>Ranma almost lost  concentration as he felt Kodachi press her body against his. He  recovered just in time to repeat the process of jumping back and  forth between buildings. Damnit! Concentrate! Take your mind out  of the gutter! After around a half-dozen leaps he at last landed  safely on the street. He closed his eyes and breathed a big sigh of  relief. Damn, don't want to do that ever again.</p><p>The sound of applause made  him open his eyes to find himself surrounded by onlookers with  several camera flashes temporarily blinding him. He heard the  comments.</p><p>"Did you see what  the boy did?"</p><p>"Sure did. I  wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it myself!"</p><p>"He's so cool!  Risking his life to save a damsel in distress!"</p><p>"Not to mention  cute!"</p><p>"Ooohhh! Just look  at those biceps!"</p><p>"Maybe he's single!"</p><p>"He's mine!"</p><p>"In your dreams!"</p><p>"Quick get his name  and number!"</p><p>"Hey, kid, can I  interview you?"</p><p>Ranma began to panic as  the crowd pressed towards him. He looked around for an escape and  jumped on top of a street light he saw above the heads. From there he  jumped onto a moving bus and another street light before rounding a  corner and disappearing from the crowd's view leaving them more than  a little disappointed.</p><p>Ranma stopped when he saw  he landed in a deserted mini-park among the buildings.</p><p>"Whew! Some peace  and quiet! Okay, Kodachi, ya can let go now..." Ranma went  silent as he saw Kodachi sleeping peacefully in his arms with a  smile. He blinked several times. Okay, who are ya and what did ya  do with the real Kodachi? was the first thought in his mind. He  shook his head and looked again. Egads! She can actually be cute  when she's not crazy or trying ta kill ya! He smiled. Musta  tired herself out more than I thought. He shrugged, turned, got  his bearings and continued his way home, taking extra care not to  wake the sleeping girl.</p><p>Nodoka was waiting  patiently outside her home for her son to return with Kodachi. She  finished all the necessary preparations for their return a few  minutes before and now used the time to think on how to help the Kuno  girl. The girl's reaction to her son's curse was not what she  expected.</p><p>Then again, with her  disturbed personality I should have expected anything.</p><p>Nodoka sighed. It seemed  Kodachi was more than a little infatuated with her son. As much as  she wanted to give the girl her happiness with Ranma Nodoka knew it  would be, at best, a very difficult undertaking. Her son already had  too many commitments. Of course if Ranma and the other girls wouldn't  mind... neither would Nodoka. Hmmm, now that's an interesting  thought. She smiled mischievously and barely stopped herself from  doing a little dance of joy out on the street as she continued to  plot her son's love affairs. She settled for a small maniacal laugh  and rubbing her hands together in glee.</p><p>In the meantime,  perhaps having a mother-figure and a friend would be enough for  Kodachi for now. Oh, if only there was a way for Ranma to make all  the girls happy!</p><p>Nodoka broke out of her  daydreams when she saw her son land a few meters in front of her with  Kodachi in his arms. She became alarmed when she saw the panicked  look on his face and heard the moans from the girl. She quickly  rushed to them.</p><p>Ranma was only a block  away from home when he felt Kodachi stir in his arms.</p><p>About time. Thought  ya'd never wake up. He became worried when Kodachi moaned deep  from within her throat. Eh? Is she hurt or something? He  nearly slipped when he heard Kodachi's next utterance.</p><p>"Oh, Ranma-darling,  that feels so good."</p><p>What the hell? He  sweat-dropped as Kodachi moaned loud enough for people on the street  to look up. Oh, shit! This is not good! This is definitely not  good!</p><p>"Oooooohhhhhh!  Yes! Do me now, Ranma-darling!" Kodachi cried. More people  looked in his direction. Ranma forcibly stamped down the urge to  throw Kodachi away like a hot potato. His mother probably wouldn't  understand why he threw her away.</p><p>"Get a room, you  pervert!"</p><p>There goes the  neighborhood. He looked around and saw the looks people were  giving him. This is gonna get ugly. He looked up to the  heavens. Why me?</p><p>"Hey, mom, look!  That boy's fondling a half-naked girl!"</p><p>"Hush, son! Just  ignore him!" The pervert! Doing things like that in  public! The mother shook her head. The youngsters these days!</p><p>"AAAAAAHHHHHH!"</p><p>Ranma fled in a cloud of  dust.</p><p>"Mom!" The  panic in Ranma's voice was evident. Kodachi's moans and cries only  got louder and people were looking at him strangely.</p><p>"What is it, Ranma?  Why is Kodachi moaning? Is she hurt..."</p><p>"Yes! Yes,  Ranma-darling! Faster! Harder! Yes! Yes! Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p><p>Nodoka stopped dead in her  tracks as she could hear Kodachi clearly now. Her eyes widened and  she turned deep scarlet in embarassment as she realized what was  happening.</p><p>"Oh. My."</p><p>"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!  Oh, yes! You are such a man, Ranma-darling!"</p><p>"No! She's fine!  She's having a... a..."</p><p>"Very, very, very  naughty dream." Nodoka finished for her son.</p><p>"Mom! Can we please  wake her up or at least go in? People are staring!"</p><p>"Oh, my! Of course,  of course. Let's go in." She quickly ushered her son inside the  gate. Oh, dear. How do I explain this to the neighbors? She  was sure the neighborhood would be buzzing tonight. She nearly  fainted when Kodachi screamed and bucked wildly in Ranma's arms just  as she was about to close the gate.</p><p>"Yes! Oh, yes! I'm  coming, Ranma-darling! I'm comingggggg!"</p><p>Nodoka quickly clamped her  hands over the girl's mouth and helped her son hold Kodachi down.</p><p>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!  Oh, dear! Now she was sure the neighborhood would be abuzz  tonight. She can also expect a visit from the neighborhood council in  the next few days. She shook her head as she and Ranma waited for  Kodachi to calm down. Kodachi took almost five minutes to settle down  and at the end mother and son were both covered in sweat. Well,  that was embarassing. Nodoka smiled wryly to herself. And I  thought I was wild in bed. She smiled in spite of herself as she  remembered what she was like in bed. She idly noted that her son was  blushing from head to toe. She tried to make light of the embarassing  moment.</p><p>"Well, son, I have  to say I'm proud of you. Satisfying a girl like that, you must truly  be a man-among-men. Even if it was only in her dreams. Then again, it  also means you have a lot to live up to. Do you think you're up to to  the challenge?" Nodoka teased lightheartedly.</p><p>"You were soooo  gooood, Ranma-darling." Kodachi murmured contentedly and  snuggled even closer. "Now I know why your mother named you  'Ranma'."</p><p>Nodoka grinned from ear to  ear. "See?" She knows why I named Ranma 'Ranma'? Now  that's a story I'd like to hear. Hmmm... Maybe I should show the  girls Ranma's baby pictures... Then they'd know why. An impish  smile appeared on her face.</p><p>Ranma trembled with a  vengeance as another feeling of doom descended  over him when he saw the smile on his mom's face. Now what? That  smile gives me the creeps! He shook it off and focused on the  present. "Mom! This isn't funny!"</p><p>Nodoka snapped out her  musings. "Ranma, you need to lighten up."</p><p>"Lighten up?  Lighten up? I'll be known as the neighborhood pervert by tomorrow  morning!"</p><p>"Make that by  tonight, dear." Nodoka cheerfully corrected and lightly patted  her son's shoulder.</p><p>Ranma gave his mother a  half-lidded gaze. "Mom, yer not helping."</p><p>"Oh, you worry too  much, son. Don't worry, Ranma, tomorrow I'll speak to the neighbors  and explain everything."</p><p>Ranma looked at his mother  full of doubt. These things never seemed to go his way. He does a  good deed and what does he get? He simply said "Thanks, mom."  without much enthusiasm.</p><p>His mother gave a pout.  "Oh, you can be such a grouch, Ranma. You really should get a  sense of humor. Girls really love guys who have a sense of humor. Not  that I'm saying you need something more to attract girls. Or that you  need to attract more girls. Oh, my son is so manly!" Nodoka  giggled like a schoolgirl and hugged her son with motherly pride then  composed herself. "Now let's bring Kodachi to the guest room."</p><p>Ranma hung his head in  defeat and sighed with feeling. Unfortunately hanging his head gave  him a very nice view down Kodachi's leotard. His eyes bugged out and  a trickle of blood traced it's way down from his nose. The leotard  had been disheveled during Kodachi's...  ahem exposing her... ahem. His head snapped back up as he tried to  rearrange the leotard as best as he could without touching flesh. He  again beseeched the powers that be. Why me? He just knew he  was gonna get pounded and called a pervert.</p><p>Nodoka saw what happened  and smiled. Oh, my. My son is such a gentleman. Nodoka  frowned a little. Maybe a little too much. He could have at least  taken a longer look. Oh, well. I guess I should be happy he had a  nose bleed. At least I know he has naughty thoughts about girls.  She approached her son and gently dabbed the blood away making her  son flinch. "I take it you liked what you saw, son?"  Nodoka said as innocently as possible while showing her pearly white  teeth in a very broad smile.</p><p>Ranma panicked and  windmilled his arms forgetting his arms were occupied making his  mom's eyes widen in alarm. "Mom! It's not what it looks like. I  didn't look! I didn't see! I didn't touch! I... I..."</p><p>"There, there, son.  It was an accident and it is only natural for a man to like seeing  something like that." Nodoka paused. "Aren't you  forgetting something, son?"</p><p>Ranma stopped waving his  arms about and looked at his mother questioningly. "Am I  forgetting something?"</p><p>"Yes." Nodoka  pointed up.</p><p>Ranma followed Nodoka's  finger upward in time to see Kodachi falling on him.</p><p>[Splat!]</p><p>"Oh." Ranma  mumbled from his supine position beneath the still sleeping girl.  Damn, and I thought I was a heavy sleeper. He raised his head  and was about to push Kodachi off so that he could stand when what he  saw made him freeze. Kodachi landed in reverse position straddling  him with her knees on either side of his chest and her butt up in the  air. His mind turned to jelly when he noted the vague wet outline in  the leotard. His mind blew up when he felt Kodachi's cheek resting on  an interesting part of his anatomy. The resulting nose bleed rivaled  the great Krakatoa volcanic eruption in 1883. He collapsed back on  his back, groggy from loss of blood and mumbling incoherently.</p><p>[Click!] [Flash!] [Whir!]</p><p>[Click!] [Flash!] [Whir!]</p><p>The strange sounds and  flashes of light caused him to look to his right in time to see his  mom putting away her camera inside her kimono. His eyes widened.</p><p>"Mom? Watcha  doing?"</p><p>Nodoka looked at her son  in puzzlement. "Taking pictures, son. I always carry a camera  so that I can photographs moments like this." And what a  moment this is! Nodoka smirked inside.</p><p>I know I'm gonna  regret asking. "Uh, why?"</p><p>"For posterity, of  course. One day in the future they'll laugh at all this."  Nodoka reasoned. She found the position her son and Kodachi in  extremely amusing. It took most of her willpower not to laugh at her  son's predicament. Oh, I can't wait to show this to the other  girls! I'm sure they'll find it amusing also.</p><p>Lightning flashed and  thunder rolled.</p><p>Flashbacks of the cookie  incident came rushing painfully back to Ranma. Not if I don't  live long enough to have them. He knew the position he was in was  far more incriminating. There was no way any of his fiancees would  believe his explanation. I have to get rid of those picture _and_  negatives! He looked for a place to push Kodachi off without  touching any private parts. After a couple of minutes he gave up and  looked to his mother pleading for help. "Uh, mom, d'ya think ya  can take Kodachi offa me so I can stand up?"</p><p>"Oh, of course.  Where are my manners." Nodoka quickly helped her son to his  feet. Once he was up and cradling Kodachi again she dabbed the larger  amount of blood on her son's face. "I take it you enjoyed the  second view more than the first?" My son is so manly!</p><p>Ranma blushed red from  head to toe and made an unintelligible sound.</p><p>"There, there, son.  Like I said, it was an accident and it is only natural for a man to  like seeing something like that. If you didn't like what you saw then  some may say you don't like girls." Nodoka paused. "You  do like girls, don't you, Ranma?" Nodoka said to tease her son.  She rearranged the girl's leotard some more.</p><p>Ranma almost choked. "Of  course I like girls! I'm a guy!"</p><p>"Then you have  nothing to be ashamed of, Ranma. Your reaction was only natural for a  healthy young man. I would be more worried if you had no reaction at  all."</p><p>"But, but, but..."</p><p>"Oh, don't worry  about it, son. Now let's get Kodachi into bed before she catches a  cold wearing only that."</p><p>Ranma was still a little  bit dazed as he followed his mom to the kitchen after they made  Kodachi as comfortable as possible on a spare futon in the guest  bedroom. Visions of what he had seen still floated around in his  head.</p><p>"Would you like  something to eat or drink, Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma remembered he was  hungry. "Yeah, that would be great, mom."</p><p>Nodoka quickly brought out  tea and rice balls. "Are these fine, Ranma? Dinner will be  ready in a few minutes."</p><p>"Uh, do we have  something cold to drink, mom?"</p><p>"Of course, son.  Would you like some juice, iced tea or soda?"</p><p>"Soda would be  great, mom!" His mother gave him a can.</p><p>"Ranma, before I  forget, Nabiki called earlier. She said she, Kasumi, Akane, Shampoo  and Ukyo were attacked by Bakusozoku."</p><p>Ranma stiffened. "What?  Are they hurt, mom? Where are they?" He stood to leave.</p><p>"They're fine, son.  Nabiki called after Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo took care of the  Bakusozoku. They're all at the Tendo Dojo right now. Now sit, eat,  drink and rest for a while."</p><p>Ranma sighed with relief  and sat again. "Thank God." Then stiffened again, utter  terror gripping his heart. "They're _all_ at the Tendo Dojo? As  in Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo are at the Dojo? In one place?"</p><p>"Yes, that's what  Nabiki told me."</p><p>"Oh, shit! I gotta  get over there before the three tear each other apart."</p><p>"Watch your tongue,  young man!"</p><p>"Uh, sorry, mom. But  I gotta get over there!"</p><p>"Don't be silly,  Ranma. Nabiki said they were having fun together. She said something  about a new toy." I knew they could get along with one  another. "And the girls did promise me they wouldn't fight  anymore."</p><p>Ranma blinked, blinked.  Yeah, right. Like that's gonna stop them for long. "Are  ya sure? They're not tearing each other apart or something?"</p><p>"Yes, I'm sure."</p><p>"Now _that's_ weird.  I wonder what got into them?"</p><p>"Come now, Ranma.  You don't give the girls enough credit."</p><p>Ranma looked at his mom  uncertainly. Well, maybe his mother was right. Still he'd be able to  sleep better if he made sure. "Uh, I think I'd better check on  them just to make sure."</p><p>Nodoka smiled. It was what  she expected from her son. "Go ahead, son, I'll call the Dojo  and tell them you're coming. I'll wait for you for dinner."</p><p>Ranma finished the  crackers, drank the rest of the soda in one gulp and stood to leave.</p><p>Nodoka place her hand over  her son's ."Ranma, be careful. Some of these Bakusozoku can be  vicious."</p><p>"I will, mom."</p><p>"Thank you. Now go  and I'll check on Kodachi. You can tell me what happened to her when  you get back."</p><p>Akane,  Kasumi, Shampoo and Ukyo were enjoying themselves as they watched  with amusement Nabiki trying to control the big bike around the Tendo  backyard. Nabiki was the last to ride the big Kawasaki as she was  left with the shortest straw. They all had some bruises and scratches  to show for their efforts but they didn't mind. The injuries weren't  enough to mar their perfect complexions and the ride had been  exhilarating to say the least, it gave them all a thrill to feel the  powerful 450cc engine thrum between their legs. They couldn't wait to  drive the motorcycle around Nerima.</p><p>Speaking  of power, Ranma chose that moment to drop behind the four girls.</p><p>"Hey,  watcha doing? And what the heck is that racket?" He couldn't  see the girls' new toy but he did hear the roar of the four-cylinder  engine.</p><p>"Ranma/Ranchan/Airen!"  Shampoo moved to glomp her Airen when a shout from Nabiki made her  stop.</p><p>"Look  out!"</p><p>The  four girls all sidestepped in time to avoid being run over by Nabiki  leaving Ranma to stare slack-jawed as the huge 'bicycle' roared  towards him.</p><p>[Splat!]</p><p>"Uh,  hi, Nabiki. Is this yer new toy?" Ranma mumbled from beneath  the motorcycle's front tire. Man, like I didn't have enough  trouble with Shampoo's bicycle. He groaned as visions of him  getting splattered under the monster motorcycle again and again came  into his head. I gotta get rid of this thing!</p><p>"Ranma/Airen/Ranchan!  Are you all right?"</p><p>"I'm  okay, just get this thing offa me."</p><p>Nabiki  quickly got off the Kawasaki and the girls all helped push it off  their fallen fiance.</p><p>Ranma  picked himself up and dusted his clothes. "Uh, so where did ya  get the motorcycle?"</p><p>"Oh,  the Bakusozoku left it when they ran off." Nabiki replied.</p><p>Ranma  looked at Nabiki dubiously. "They left something like this  behind?"</p><p>The  girls shrugged. "Maybe they felt bad about harassing us poor,  weak, defenseless, little girls." Shampoo suggested innocently.  Akane, Ukyo and Nabiki sniggered while Kasumi simply smiled.</p><p>"Yeah,  right." Probably pounded them senseless. "So, uh,  all of ya all right? None of ya got hurt?"</p><p>"Why,  Ranma, are you worried about us?" Nabiki teased.</p><p>Ranma  blinked "Me? Worry about you guys? Hah!" He tried to  weasel his way out. "Uh, my mom told me ta check on ya, that's  all."</p><p>"Oh,  my. That's not what Auntie said to me on the telephone. She said you  insisted on coming over to make sure we were all right."</p><p>"Erk!  She did? Hehe." Drat!</p><p>"Aha!  Admit it! You were worried about us!" Akane, Nabiki, Shampoo  and Ukyo triumphantly crowed.</p><p>"So?  What about it?" Ranma huffed. "I can see I worried for  nuthin'! Shoulda known better than worry about a bunch of _tomboys_!"  He tried to change the subject.</p><p>"So  you admit it!"</p><p>"Who's  a tomboy?"</p><p>Bingo!  Thank God for Akane. Ranma tried not to grin too much.</p><p>Nabiki  quickly put her hand over Akane's mouth before her younger sister  could ruin the way things were going.</p><p>"Akane,  you really need to learn what the important thing is." Nabiki  whispered. "Ranma just admitted he worries about us and all you  heard is the tomboy remark. No wonder you two hardly got anywhere."</p><p>Akane's  eyes widened. "You're right! He did admit it, didn't he?"  She turned to her fiance and pointed a finger at him.</p><p>"Aha!  So you admit it!" The four other girls simply hung their heads.</p><p>"Er,  no?" Drat! And double drat!</p><p>"You  can't deny it, Saotome, we all heard you say 'you worried for  nuthin'."</p><p>"Well,  so what? And what's it to ya anyway, Nabiki?" If you can't  weasel your way out, try bulling your way out. Nabiki's been  acting weird all day. Come to think of it, they're all acting weird  today. Hope it's not contagious or anything.</p><p>"Uh,  I, we, nothing, Saotome. Nothing."</p><p>Ranma  looked at Nabiki closely making the girl color a little. "Ya  sure ya ain't hurt or anything? I thought I jes heard ya stutter or  sumthin'." He looked at her face from side to side, up and  down.</p><p>"Uh,  I, uh, ahem, I'm fine, Ranma. Just a little sore throat." Stop  looking at me like that already!</p><p>"Ya  sure?" He stepped closer, almost nose to nose. Nabiki had to  call upon every reserve of self-control she had to maintain her  composure and resist grabbing that head and kissing those lips that  were 'oh, so close.'</p><p>[Whap!]</p><p>Akane  hit Ranma on the back of the head causing his head to jerk forward  and making him kiss Nabiki on the lips. She was about to say "Stop  being such a jerk, Ranma! Can't you see you're making Nabiki  uncomfortable!" when she saw what happened.</p><p>Time  stopped in the Tendo backyard as everyone went bug-eyed.</p><p>Ranma's  first thought was Oh, shit! I'm gonna die. He was about to  jerk his head back when he saw the look in Nabiki's eyes just before  she closed them. He then heard the girl sigh and felt her deepen the  kiss. He was caught like a deer in the headlights. His last thought  was Must resist. before his mind turned to jello once again  and his toes began to curl. He was vaguely aware of her arms climbing  to his neck and his arms encircling her waist.</p><p>Nabiki  went rigid and her eyes widened as she felt those lips touch her own.  Her efforts to maintain control went out the window and her thoughts  turned to mush. From her lips a sensation not unlike being  electrocuted with a small electrical charge began to spread  throughout her whole body. She closed her eyes and sighed as the  electric sensation was replaced by a feeling of utter contentment.  She was barely aware as she deepened the kiss and raised her arms to  encircle Ranma's neck and pull him closer. She was about to give him  some tongue when a loud</p><p>"AHEM!"</p><p>brought  the two of them back to the present.</p><p>Ranma  gave an "Eep!" and jumped back as he realized what he was  doing in front of his three fiancees. He turned terror stricken eyes  to see Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo glowing with huge battle auras. He  could feel the heat from them. He waved his arms frantically in a  warding manner. "It's not what it looks like!"</p><p>"Well,  it looked _a lot_ like kissing to me!" Akane growled.</p><p>"Yeah,  and _you_ looked like you enjoyed it!" Ukyo accused.</p><p>"_Really_  enjoyed it!" Shampoo appended.</p><p>"No,  I didn't!"</p><p>"You  didn't enjoy kissing me?" Ranma turned to see Nabiki with a  hurt look.</p><p>Ranma,  as usual, panicked when he saw a girl in distress. He tried to  appease Nabiki. "NO! I mean, YES! I mean..." Oh,  shit! I'm really gonna die!</p><p>"I'm  waiting." Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo said together, frowns on  their cute faces, arms across their chest and right foot tapping  impatiently.</p><p>Ranma  said the first thing that came to mind even if it didn't make any  sense. "I didn't do it! I mean I didn't do it on purpose! It  was an accident!" He pointed at Akane. "That's it! An  accident! She pushed me! And I didn't enjoy it! I mean I...  AAAAAAHHHHHH!" He performed the Saotome Ultimate Technique  as soon as he saw the three of them reach for their weapons. WHY  ME? WHY THE HELL ME?</p><p>His  three fiancees were about to go off in pursuit when they heard Nabiki  say:</p><p>"I  don't think Auntie would like it if you three beat up her son."</p><p>That  immediately made the three pause.</p><p>"Oh,  my. I think Nabiki's right."</p><p>"Well,  we can't let him get away with it! He kissed you and then he insulted  you!" Akane huffed. Not to mention he kissed you and not  me! And he enjoyed kissing you!</p><p>"Yeah!"  Shampoo and Ukyo agreed to both the statement and the thought.</p><p>"Well,  it was an accident. You did push him, Akane." Nabiki reasoned.  And it's not as if I didn't enjoy it. I'll have to say thanks to  little sis one of these days. Hot damn!</p><p>"But  still...!"</p><p>"Come  on, ladies. Is beating the hell out your fiance the best idea you can  think of to get even?"</p><p>"Easy  for you to say! You got to kiss him!" Ukyo retorted.</p><p>"Yeah,  and I suppose _you_ can think of a better idea!" Shampoo added.</p><p>"As  a matter of fact I do have a better idea and just this once I'm going  to give it for free."</p><p>Akane,  Shampoo and Ukyo squinted. "For free? You?"</p><p>"Why,  that's very nice of you, Nabiki."</p><p>"Thanks,  Kasumi. It's always refreshing to see someone not so cynical. Anyway,  consider it as a token of my goodwill to, um, possible co-fiancees."  Besides, that's just bait. I've got bigger fish to catch.</p><p>"All  right, we're listening."</p><p>"Simple  really." Nabiki turned to Ukyo. "Ukyo, you said I got to  kiss him. Well, what's stopping you from asking him for a kiss as  well? I'm sure if you ask Ranma nicely he can't say no. Especially if  you bring to his attention he kissed me."</p><p>"No  way! I'm not going to ask that pervert to kiss me!" Akane  immediately blurted out.</p><p>"Suit  yourself, Akane, although I can say for certain you're going to miss  out on a lot if you don't." Nabiki meaningfully touched her  lips with her fingertips. "That was one hell of a kiss."  I can get used to that.</p><p>Shampoo  and Ukyo swallowed while Akane and Kasumi blushed.</p><p>"It...  it was that good?" Shampoo asked. She wondered if it was better  than when she kissed Ranma before. Ooohhh, I have to kiss him  again!</p><p>Nabiki  smiled like a cheshire cat. "More than good. You've got to feel  it to believe it."</p><p>Shampoo  and Ukyo swallowed harder. I want to! I want to!</p><p>"Uh,  um, well, it does sound better than beating the stuffing out of the  jackass." Ukyo finally agreed. Shampoo nodded her head  vigorously. "Um, so I guess you know how to ask him 'nicely'?"</p><p>[Ka-ching!]</p><p>Nabiki  heard the cash register ring and smiled. Time to reel them in.  "Of course. You see, that's the difference between the three of  you and me. You tend to use your fists first while I like to think  things over."</p><p>"Okay,  okay! So out with it already."</p><p>"Uh,  uh. This one's going to cost you."</p><p>Akane  (who was listening despite herself), Shampoo and Ukyo groaned. I  should have known.</p><p>"Suit  yourself ladies." Nabiki turned and nonchalantly delivered the  coup-de-grâce. "I wonder what it would feel like with  some tongue."</p><p>Shampoo  and Ukyo crumbled. "Okay! Okay! You win!" They handed  over every yen they had on them.</p><p>Nabiki  took the cash and turned to her youngest sister. "Well, what  about you, Akane?"</p><p>Akane  fumed. She didn't want to but she couldn't let her two rivals get  ahead. The pervert! Making me ask him to kiss me. If Nabiki  was going to teach them it was sure to work. She blushed despite  herself as she imagined about what it would feel like. She came to  with a start. What am I thinking? I'm getting as perverted as he  is! She angrily stomped over and handed her cash as well.</p><p>"This  better be worth it!"</p><p>"Oh,  it's going to be worth it. That I can assure you, baby sister."  Nabiki purred.</p><p>"Fine,  fine! So what's your great plan?"</p><p>"You've  made a wise choice, sis. You won't regret it." Nabiki smiled.  There was more than enough yen for what she was planning when she  tells Ranma her feelings. He'll never know what hit him.</p><p>"What  about Kasumi?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Kasumi  doesn't need it. One look from her and Ranma can't say no."</p><p>Kasumi  blushed from head to toe. "Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. Do you think  so, Nabiki?" She giggled despite herself. I wonder what it  feels like to kiss someone.</p><p>"See?"</p><p>The  first three fiancees groaned again. The competition just got a whole  lot hotter.</p><p>Ranma looked around  surreptitiously from his hiding place in a tree. He had not seen his  three angry fiancees for the last half-hour and he hoped they had  given up chasing him. He didn't know they didn't pursue him at all,  he was too busy saving his skin to check. He heaved a sigh of relief  as he saw no sign of them and made the final leap to his house.</p><p>"I'm home!"  Ranma called out as he landed in their backyard carefully avoiding  the mounds this time. His mom came to the kitchen door to greet him.</p><p>"Welcome back, my  son." She led him to the kitchen table. As soon as he was  seated she laid out dinner for them. "How were the girls,  Ranma?" Tonight she prepared some sushi.</p><p>"Uh, they're fine,  mom. They're fine." Ranma replied nervously.</p><p>Nodoka smiled. She mistook  the reason for her son's nervousness. "Ranma, there is nothing  wrong in showing you care for them." She sat down opposite him.</p><p>"It's not that,  mom." He began to dig in. Man, why does these things happen  to me? They're gonna kill me tomorrow for sure!</p><p>"Then what is it,  Ranma? What is bothering you?" Nodoka also began eating.</p><p>"Aw, don't worry  about it, mom." He said evasively. And what's with Nabiki?  She's been acting strange the whole day! If I didn't know better I'd  say she liked the kiss as much as I  did! Ranma blinked. Waitaminute! I did _not_  like the kiss! No! Definitely not! Uh, uh! He groaned inwardly.  I am so dead tomorrow.</p><p>Nodoka looked at her son  seriously. "Son, you are my only child. You are the most  important person in this world to me. I will always worry about you  because I care about you. If something, anything bothers you can  always tell me about it and I will help any way I can."</p><p>Ranma squirmed  uncomfortably in his chair. "Really, mom, it's nuthin'."  Should I tell mom what happened? Mebbe she can help me. Uh, mebbe  some other time if I can't fix it on my own. Mom did say I need to  learn how to handle women. Hah! Now there's a joke. How the heck do I  handle them if Ican't even understand them?</p><p>Nodoka considered his  reponse. I wonder what's bothering Ranma. I better ask the girls  later. "Very well, my son. However, remember that I will  always be there for you."</p><p>Ranma nodded and  swallowed. "So, how's Kodachi, mom?"</p><p>"She seems to be  fine, son. No external injuries. She's sleeping peacefully for now."  Nodoka had taken the liberty of exchanging Kodachi's leotard for one  of her nightgowns.</p><p>"That's good."</p><p>"Yes. Can you tell  me what happened?"</p><p>"Ah, nuthin' much,  mom."</p><p>"Where did you catch  up with her."</p><p>"Uh, I think we were  already in Shiodome."</p><p>Nodoka's right eyebrow  went up a little. That was more than a dozen kilometers away. "What  happened when you caught up with her?"</p><p>"Well, she tried to  cut me up with her ribbon."</p><p>Nodoka nodded, she  expected as much. "Were you injured, Ranma?"</p><p>"Nuthin' much. Just  a bruise here and here." He showed the fast fading welts on his  arm and leg.</p><p>Nodoka nodded, thankful  her son was all right. "Then what happened?"</p><p>"I was able to catch  her ribbon then we sorta got into a tug of war. She fell off the  rooftop when the ribbon broke. I had to go and catch her. She calmed  down when I changed back into a boy while holding her." He left  out the fine print. No need to alarm his mother that the rooftop was  some sixty stories high. "I think she fell asleep on the way  back here."</p><p>"And nothing else  happened?" Nodoka could not help but feel her son was leaving  out some parts.</p><p>"Uh, um, well you  saw what happened on the way back here, mom." Ranma said with a  blush.</p><p>"Oh." Nodoka  blushed, remembering the embarassing incident. "Well, I guess  that's it then. We'll just have to wait until she wakes up."</p><p>"Yeah, guess so. Uh,  mom?"</p><p>"Yes, son?"</p><p>"D'ya really think  we can help her? I mean with what happened to her and all?"</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "I do  not know, Ranma, but it is our duty to at least try. I hope she will  be in a more receptive mood when she wakes up."</p><p>After they finished  dinner, Ranma helped his mother put away the dishes.</p><p>"Ranma, if you don't  mind I would like to talk to you some more."</p><p>"Uh, sure. What  about?"</p><p>"About your training  trip, about the ten years we were apart."</p><p>"Uh, sure ya wanna  hear about that? Some parts ain't pretty." That's putting  it mildly.</p><p>"That is exactly the  reason why I want to know." I wonder if I should sharpen my  katanas and tantos?</p><p>"Uh, okay."  Well, I warned her.</p><p>"Thank you. Please  wait for me in the living room. I will check on Kodachi before we  talk about your training trip."</p><p>"Sure, mom."</p><p>Ranma was munching on a  chip watching the latest Jackie Chan / Jet Li movie on television  Hah! Wimps! I can do _way_ better than that! when he saw his  mother enter the living room. He switched off the television. "How's  Kodachi, mom?"</p><p>"She's sleeping  soundly, Ranma. I think her run tired her out."</p><p>"Yeah, I thought as  much." He waited for his mother to make herself comfortable.  "So what d'ya wanna know about the training trip, mom?"</p><p>"Everything you can  remember, Ranma."</p><p>Well the very first  thing I can remember is this fight I had with another boy..."</p><p>Author's note: Read my  version of Ranma's training journey in the first side story of this  fanfic.</p><p>Kodachi looked around in  puzzlement at her surroundings. It seemed she was back in her room in  her home. How can that be? I was running away from that hussy.  Kodachi decided to leave her room to search for answers. Something  is wrong. The house looks familiar yet I can feel there is something  different. She continued on her quest. Perhaps Sasuke has the  answers. "Sasuke!" No answer. "Sasuke!"  Still silence. Where is that incompetent fool? When I find him  he will regret failing to answer my summons! Kodachi stomped off  in search of the ninja. When she rounded the wall overlooking the  living room she froze at the sight.</p><p>A smaller version of  Kodachi was running around in the living room of their mansion  chasing her big brother while their mother merrily watched her two  children play happily. It was early evening at the Kuno estate and  the small family was waiting for the father to get home so they could  eat dinner together.</p><p>Mother? Kodachi  was about to go down when a laugh drew her attention.</p><p>It was times like this  little Kodachi was happiest. It showed in the way she smiled and  laughed.</p><p>Kodachi looked at her  younger version in wonder. Was I ever that happy? She again  attempted to join the happy little family when she realized just what  was about to happen. She froze in horror. No! I must warn them!  She began to run but no matter how fast she ran she did not get  closer. Why? Why can't I get closer? Her eyes widened in  fear as she saw the six men armed with knives enter the living room  pushing their servants. She trembled in revulsion as one by one their  female servants were raped. Her mouth opened when one of the men  started for her mother.</p><p>"NNNNNNOOOOOO!"</p><p>Ranma's recounting of his  journey was interrupted by the bloodcurdling scream.</p><p>Kodachi!</p><p>He was already up the  stairs by the time his mother stood up. When Nodoka reached the door  to the guestroom she saw her son standing uncertainly over Kodachi  who was now tossing and turning wildly on the bed.</p><p>"Mother! Mother!  Stay away from mother!" Little Kodachi screamed in horror as  the bad men started to tear her mother's clothes apart. Kodachi  started to cry as her mother screamed helplessly. She struggled  mightily in a hopeless attempt to break her bonds.</p><p>Nodoka quickly went to  kneel beside the girl she knew was gripped in a terrifying nightmare.</p><p>"Father! Where are  you, father? Help us, father!" Kodachi looked around  desperately for salvation.</p><p>Nodoka tried to shake  Kodachi awake.</p><p>"No! Keep away! Stay  away from me!" Kodachi again screamed as the men went for her.  "Mother! Father!" She slapped Nodoka's hand away.</p><p>"Mother! Talk to me,  mother! Mother!" Kodachi watched in agony as her mother's life  slowly ebbed. She screamed. "SOMEBODY, ANYBODY, HELP ME! PLEASE  HELP ME!" She began to sob "Help me, please. Anybody."  She cried plaintively. "I'm sorry, mother. I should have been  stronger for you. I... I..."</p><p>Kodachi curled up into a  ball, rocking to comfort herself until the horrific image of her  dying mother faded. "I will be strong, I will be strong, I will  be strong. Mother, I swear to you. I will be strong." As her  mother faded from view Kodachi let out one final scream. "MOTHER!"</p><p>"Kodachi! Kodachi,  wake up!" Nodoka vigorously shook the girl until Kodachi's eyes  flew open. The girl looked around her surroundings in a frenzy until  she saw Ranma standing over her.</p><p>"Ranma!"  Kodachi flung herself at the boy and wrapped her arms around him. She  trembled violently. She buried her head in his chest and sobbed.   "Ranma, please. Please hold me. Make it go away! Make them go  away!"</p><p>"Kodachi, I..."</p><p>"Ranma, please. Just  hold me." The way Kodachi said it touched Ranma. He had never  seen Kodachi so vulnerable before.</p><p>Ranma hesitantly embraced  the terrified girl. He looked at his mother for guidance.</p><p>Nodoka nodded and went to  whisper in her son's ear. "Just hold her, son. She needs  reassurance." She guided her son to sit on the futon. "Rock  her gently, Ranma. She will fall asleep soon."</p><p>As Nodoka predicted,  Kodachi did fall asleep in her son's arms. Ranma gently laid her down  on the futon and helped his mother make Kodachi as comfortable as  possible again. They quietly left.</p><p>"Mom, d'ya think  she'll be all right?" Ranma asked once they closed the door.</p><p>"I do not know,  Ranma. If her nightmare is any indication..."</p><p>"D'ya think it was  about the time her mother was murdered?"</p><p>"Yes, I think so.  Her screams matched what I read about the tragedy." Nodoka  looked at the door. "Poor Dachi."</p><p>Ranma followed his  mother's gaze. "Uh, do ya think I ought to watch over her? Just  for tonight in case she has that nightmare again."</p><p>Nodoka looked at her son  approvingly. A true martial artist. She could not help but smile with  pride. "Yes, I think that would be a good idea. It would  reassure her greatly to see someone watching over her in the  morning."</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Do you think you  have enough strength left, son? You've had a tiring day."</p><p>"It's okay, mom.  I've done much more tiring stuff before than just watch over someone  for a night."</p><p>"All right then.  I'll bring you some refreshments before I sleep. Now, why don't we  continue your story about the training journey."</p><p>Genma and Soun staggered  with their arms around each other's shoulders into the fifth bar of  their drinking spree. It wasn't the best they have been in and it was  located in one of the seedier parts of the city. They weren't there  by choice either. They had been asked politely to leave from each  previous five bars.</p><p>"I'm telling ya,  Soun, that woman's sh-poiling the boy! She's ruining all my hard work  all theshe yearsh!" Genma whined to his drinking companion once  they were seated at the bar and had drinks in hand.</p><p>"Yesh, yesh,  Shaotome." Soun replied as a good drinking buddy should.</p><p>"Not only that,  Tendo, sh-she's endangering the union of our familiesh!"</p><p>"Sho true, sho berry  true, Shaotome. Sho, what do we do?"</p><p>"Deshperate times  call for deshperate measuresh, Tendo!" Genma declared.</p><p>"Yesh, yesh,  Saotome, quite right." Soun couldn't agree more.</p><p>"And I have jes the  plan to make sure that ungrateful boy of mine marriesh your Akane."</p><p>"Yesh?" Soun  questioned as he leaned forward in anticipation. Genma always seemed  to have the answers to their problems.</p><p>Genma paused dramatically.  He leaned in close and whispered as if afraid someone might overhear.  "We jes hafta make shure that boy getsh Akane pregnant! He'll  have no choice but to marry her!"</p><p>Thunder rolled in the  distance and the entire population of Nerima trembled as a chill of  foreboding came over them. One thought came into their heads.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Soun looked at his best  friend crossed-eyed. The part of his brain still sober screamed there  was something definitely wrong with the plan. Unfortunately that part  was the minority. They were pronptly blindfolded, gagged, hogtied,  lynched to death and thrown into the deepest recesses of Soun's mind  by the drunken, wildly partying majority.</p><p>"Why, dash  brilliant, Shaotome!" Soun's voice went into conspiratory mode.  "Sho do you have a plan to make it happen, Shaotome?"</p><p>Genma simply smiled as he  struggled drunkenly to his feet followed by Soun. They wrapped their  arms around each other's shoulders, raised their glasses and  announced to anyone who was still conscious in the bar.</p><p>"It's Soun's..."</p><p>"... and Genma's..."</p><p>"Operation: Ranma  Knocks Up Akane!"</p><p>All over Japan, animals,  birds and fishes scampered around for shelter. Unlike stupid humans  they knew when a cataclysm, like Armageddon, was about to happen.  They were also smart enough to run for cover.</p><p>End  Chapter 4.</p><p>Author's  notes/Acknowledgements/etc.</p><p>Sorry  this chapter took longer than usual. I had a bad case of writer's  block compounded by a project that needed finishing, some chores my  better half wanted done and the extra-hot weather here in the  Philippines.</p><p>1.  got the info from this webpage: h t t p: / / w w w  ..ca/433-661bw98/g04/japancostume.h tml</p><p>2.  Bousouzoku/Bosozoku: the Japanese equivalent to punk bikers,  well-versed in the traditional biker activities: act tough, ride  around and beat up people, get weird haircuts, annoy others with loud  revving motorcycles, etc.</p><p>3.  Bakusozoku: more wild type of biker.</p><p>I  forgot the website where I got the info regarding Japan's motorcycle  gangs. Once I find it again, I'll put the proper acknowledgement.</p><p>So  how did you like the chapter? This is my first attempt at writing  action and heavy drama scenes. I rewrote some of the scenes a couple  of times because I wasn't satisfied with them. I think I can still do  better so any comments are welcome.</p><p>Also  I'm beginning to use some Japanese terms. Any mistake I make in their  use anyone is welcome to correct. I'll appreciate it.</p><p>Thanks  for all the comments/reviews on chapter three.</p><p>Jerry  Unipeg, TopQuark, dogbertcarroll, darkwoofe,</p><p>I'm  glad you liked chapter three. I have to admit it's because I'm gifted  with a perverted, sick and twisted mind.</p><p>dennisud,</p><p>Yeah,  I'm so bad! But don't get me wrong, those Amazons have _permission_  to go after Ranma but it's not a sure thing. What's sure is that they  will go husband hunting. See Ryoga run. See Dr. Tofu run. See Mousse  run. See Soun run. See Copycat Ken run. See Principal Kuno run. See  Tatewaki Kuno run. Bwahahahahahaha!</p><p>Joe  Fenton,</p><p>As  always, thanks for the comments. I enjoyed our email correspondence.  It was very educational. Feel free to always point out errors on my  part.</p><p>Warpwizard,</p><p>Yeah,  I'll remember your advice about free will and, uh, you're making me  hungry for stew.</p><p>Tyverius,</p><p>I'm  happy you find my fanfic very amusing. Comments like that make me  want to write more. About bad things to say, I can take criticism as  long as it's polite so don't be shy. Also, I feel flattered an  English Major (you _are_ an English Major, right?) considers my  spelling and grammar to be very good. I'll try not to let it go to my  head. Not too much anyway. 8)</p><p>About  Nodoka, well, I really don't know how to potray her any other way. I  considered having her make Genma and Ranma commit seppuku but that  would have been a very short story. Not to mention depressing. 8)</p><p>To  those who'll email me, I'll read all of them but I can't promise I'll  answer every one of them. I'll try though.</p><p>With  those out of the way, more teasers about the coming chapters.</p><p>Well,  Soun and Genma are about to up the stakes. What mad schemes are they  going to try to get Akane pregnant by Ranma?</p><p>Nodoka  has met Kodachi and decided to take her under her wing as well. Will  it lead to a better, happier life for the deranged gymnast? Has  Kodachi truly accepted/believed that her Ranma-darling and the  redhead are one and the same? Will Nodoka actually show the other  girls those incriminating photos? Will Ranma survive? What about  Ranma's baby pictures?</p><p>Ranma's  angels had a bonding experience when they kicked biker butt. They  also found something to share. Will they learn something from it?</p><p>What's  Nabiki's plan to have the motorcycle legally theirs? Will Ranma  suffer the same fate with the motorcycle as he does with Shampoo's  bicycle? Will Ranma be able to get rid of the motorcycle? Will the  girls start wearing leather body outfits as the Ranma's Angels gang?  Ooohhh! Will this fanfic turn into a lemon? Nope but definitely  some lime.</p><p>What  will Nabiki teach the other girls? Will Ranma get the surprise of his  life tomorrow? You betcha!</p><p>Next  up: The training journey side story.</p><p>That's  it and remember: A perverted thought a day keeps those nasty writer's  blocks away.</p>
