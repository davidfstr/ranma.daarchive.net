</div><p>A  Mother's Tale</p><p>by  Alex Tomas</p><p>This  is my first work of fan fiction. Reviews welcome.</p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>I  do not own the Ranma characters.</p><p>Conventions:</p><p>"  " - Japanese</p><p>{  } - foreign language (Chinese, English)</p><p>[  ] - sound effects</p><p>- thoughts</p><p>#  # - signs</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This  happens after season 7 episode 143, Ranma Meets Mother Boy Meets Mom,  Part I in the television series or volume 22 chapter 2 of the manga.  It takes elements from both the anime and the manga.</p><p>Ranma's  mother, Nodoka Saotome, on her way for the first time to the Tendo  Dojo sees male-type Ranma fall into the storm drain and transform  into girl-type Ranma. Ranma stutters some excuse but Nodoka waves it  off as she is in a hurry and proceeds to the the Tendo Dojo without  giving out each other's names.</p><p>I  am assuming that Nodoka does not know the Tendos and has no knowledge  of the honor contract Genma and Soun entered into to unite their two  families. My reason is that if Genma  informed her then she would know the Tendos and vice-versa.</p><p>Chapter  3: Mama's Boy.</p><p>Nodoka  Saotome woke up with a smile on her face. Gone was the weariness that  marred her beauty since she last heard from her husband all those  months ago. In its stead was a radiance only a loving mother reunited  with her beloved child could have. She rose to face the day with  renewed vigor, not letting the sight of her husband lying next to her  dampen her buoyant spirits. She may have allowed him into her home  but she had yet to forgive him for all the heartache he had caused  her and her son.</p><p>She  put a robe over her nightgown and began her day doing the chores she  longed so much to do for her family. She hummed a happy tune as she  lit a fire to warm water for the bath and prepared a traditional  breakfast of fish, rice and miso soup. When all was in readiness she  went up the stairs to wake her little family and scowled. What she  saw upstairs ruined an otherwise perfect morning. Standing in front  of her son's bedroom door was her husband with one foot raised as if  preparing to break down the door.</p><p>Genma  wanted to wake up Ranma the usual way by tossing his son out the  window but found the door to Ranma's room locked. He was about to  break down the door and had his right foot already raised when a  throat cleared behind him. Genma turned around slowly to see his wife  standing behind him with a scowl on her face.</p><p>"Husband  dear, I hope for your sake you are not thinking of breaking down that  door." The glint in her eyes made Genma think carefully of his  answer.</p><p>If  there was one thing Genma valued greater than anything else it was  his personal well-being. Any threat to it he took very seriously.</p><p>"Um,  no?" Good answer, Genma.</p><p>"Good."</p><p>"Uh,  dear, I need to wake up Ranma in the morning to spar. It's part of  his training to be a man among men."  He left out the part on how he woke up his son. No need for Nodoka to  know he usually threw her son out a second floor window or some other  similar method.</p><p>Nodoka  did not budge. "Husband, I will not tolerate any damage to the  house and as I recall your training journey has already ended."  Nodoka raised one hand to silence Genma's protests that Ranma will  lose his edge without training. "However, I understand the need  for Ranma to continue his training. You may do so in the afternoon  when he gets back from school in the backyard but not for more than  two hours. He has a lot to catch up on in his education which you  have sorely neglected. If he has nothing do during weekends then you  may train him then also. Now if you'll excuse me, I will wake Ranma  up. I don't want him to be late for school and breakfast is already  waiting."</p><p>Nodoka  hadn't finished the last sentence when Genma bolted for the breakfast  table. His son's training may be important to him but not as  important as food. Heck, Ranma wasn't as important to Genma as food.</p><p>Five  minutes later, Ranma and his mom found Genma sitting at the dining  table contentedly patting his stomach. All the food had been eaten  except for a small portion Genma had decided would be enough for his  wife.</p><p>"Ah,  you're too late, boy. If you can't wake early enough then I'll just  have to eat your portion, too. Nodoka, I've left some of the fine  meal you prepared for you." Genma grinned when he saw his son  become angry, sure that the next morning Ranma would wake up earlier.  His plans were derailed when Nodoka simply smiled and said:</p><p>"I'm  glad you like the fish and rice, dear, and you can eat my portion as  well. Ranma, let's go into the kitchen and I'll prepare some more  breakfast for the _two_ of us."</p><p>Genma  followed mother and son into the kitchen where he saw to his chagrin  Nodoka taking out from the refrigerator breakfast items he vaguely  remembered those American servicemen he and Ranma had met on Okinawa  ate. He noted Nodoka cooked just enough eggs, bacon and sausages for  her and Ranma. He slurped the drool from his chin.</p><p>"Um,  Nodoka dearest, can you cook some for me, too?" Genma fluttered  his eyelids at his wife and tried to look cute. Ranma threw water on  his father from a glass.</p><p>[Splash!]</p><p>"Growlf!"  # What d'ya do that for? #</p><p>"Pops,  if ya wanna be cute, at least turn into a panda first!"</p><p>#  Oh, yeah! Right! Didn't think of that! Thanks, boy! # Genma tried  again.</p><p>[Punt!]</p><p>Ranma  kicked his old man unconscious out the kitchen door and into the  backyard where some bamboo grew.</p><p>"Pandas  don't eat eggs, bacon or sausages but they do eat bamboo, ya old  fart!"</p><p>[Slam!  Click!]</p><p>Ranma  slammed the door shut and locked it. "Stupid pops!" he  growled under his breath.</p><p>"Thank  you very much, my son. It's much too early in the day for your  father's antics."</p><p>"No  sweat, mom. Um, need any help?" Ranma's salivated as he smelled  the aroma rising from the food.</p><p>"Thank  you, dear, but I'm fine. Now why don't you wait at the table."</p><p>"Uh,  sure mom." Ranma sat. "Uh, mom?"</p><p>"Yes,  dear?"</p><p>"I  ain't complaining or nothing, but why are ya cooking that kind of  food?"</p><p>"Oh,  I just thought I'd cook something different and partly to get back at  your father for what he did." Nodoka shook her head, it was too  early in the day to be angry. "Cooking is one of the hobbies I  indulged in to take my mind off the loneliness. I now know how to  cook several countries' cuisines." Nodoka beamed proudly.</p><p>"Wow!  That's great, mom!"</p><p>"Thank  you, dear." Nodoka began to lay out the food onto the table and  handed Ranma a spoon, fork and knife instead of chopsticks. Ranma  attacked the food with his usual Amaguriken speed.</p><p>"Ranma,  you really should eat a lot slower. Food tastes better that way."</p><p>Ranma  stopped with the spoon in his mouth. He tried to talk around it.</p><p>"Mphf  mphf, mphf mphf!"</p><p>[Sigh.]</p><p>"Ranma,  it's not polite to talk with your mouth full especially with a spoon  sticking out of it."</p><p>Ranma  took out the spoon and swallowed. "Uh, sorry, mom, but like I  told ya yesterday, this is the way I always ate around pops."  Nodoka had heard the story of how Genma stole food from Ranma if  Ranma wasn't quick enough to defend it. She put it aside yesterday  considering it minor compared to everything else her husband had done  to Ranma but she had vowed there would be a reckoning one day with  her husband on that point. She decided to put him on a strict diet  one of these days when she had the time to waste on him. The  unconscious panda shivered.</p><p>"Your  father isn't here right now, is he?"</p><p>Ranma  looked at every nook and cranny in the kitchen before replying. He  knew from experience his father was a sneaky SOB.</p><p>"Uh,  yeah. Guess he ain't here."</p><p>"So  you can eat slower without fear of your food being stolen."</p><p>"Um,  guess so." Ranma made an effort to actually chew his food  before swallowing. "You're right, mom! The food _does_ taste  better!"</p><p>"See?  From now on eat a little slower, son. I'll make sure your father  doesn't steal your food anymore." Nodoka began to eat her own  breakfast. After his fourth helping Ranma pushed himself away from  the table.</p><p>"Mom,  that was delicious!"</p><p>"I'm  so glad you liked it Ranma. I'll have a wonderful time showing you  all the kinds of food I can cook." A gleam came into Nodoka's  eyes. "Ranma, do you think some of the girls would like to  learn cooking from me?"</p><p>"I'm  sure they'd be happy to learn from ya, mom." It'll give his  mother something to do. "But I gotta warn ya about Akane. She  has this tendency to destroy kitchens whenever she tries to cook."</p><p>A  certain tomboy sneezed.</p><p>"You  must be exaggerating, Ranma. How can anyone  destroy a kitchen just by cooking?"</p><p>"You  ain't seen Akane cook yet."</p><p>"Oh,  I'm sure we'll be just fine."</p><p>Ranma  shrugged. Well he warned his mother. He only hoped Akane didn't  totally destroy his mom's kitchen. Or their house. He crossed his  fingers.</p><p>"Oh,  I'm so glad! I'm sure we're have lots of fun together!" Nodoka  happily clapped her hands together. "Speaking of the girls,  Ranma, there is one more thing I need to talk to you about before I  forget again."</p><p>Uh,  oh. "Uh, what's that, mom?"</p><p>"It's  your attitude towards them. You said last night you didn't really  object to them as your fiancees but I observed yesterday you're not  very comfortable in their presence and not very affectionate towards  them."</p><p>Well,  duh! "Like I said last night, mom. They tend to overdo or  overreact to things."</p><p>"How  so?"</p><p>"They're  either too jealous or too affectionate. Either way I get pounded."</p><p>"I  see. Have you talked to them about it?"</p><p>"Ah,  not really. I ain't good at words. Either I get it all wrong or they  don't listen to me. That's why I need ya to talk to them for me."</p><p>"Ranma,  I will talk to them for you at the slumber party but you need to  learn how to communicate with them better. If they don't listen then  try to be more assertive. A man must learn how to handle his women  after all. It will save you from a lot of trouble in the future."</p><p>"Uh,  what's 'communicate'? Isn't that when ya ride a bus or train?"</p><p>[Sigh.]  "That's 'commute', Ranma. Communicate is another word for  talking, son."</p><p>"Oh.  I try, mom, I really do but I just get it all wrong."</p><p>"Try  harder, son. I'm sure you'll learn how." Nodoka looked at the  clock. "Oh, dear! Look what time it is already! You should get  going or you'll be late for school. We'll talk more later when you  get home from school."</p><p>"Oops!  Almost forgot. Yeah, I better get going." Ranma went up to  prepare for school.</p><p>"Don't  forget the lunch I made."</p><p>"Gotcha,  mom."</p><p>"And  Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah,  mom?"</p><p>"Try  to be more affectionate to the girls but do it equally to each. I'm  sure if you treat them nicely they'll act nicely also. It does  wonders for a girl to know she's appreciated." Nodoka left to  finish the rest of the household chores leaving her son to think on  what she said. She was confident her son would figure out what to do  on his own.</p><p>Ranma  arrived at Furinkan earlier than usual and found to his relief Kuno  wasn't at his usual place yet. He thanked the Kami since he didn't  really want to pound the kendoist anymore after what he learned. He  decided to wait at the gate for Akane and greeted his classmates that  passed by who were surprised to see him so early at school and  without Akane. He ignored the whispers behind him as he thought about  what his mother told him.</p><p>Treat  them nicely? Be more assertive? How am I supposed to that? Probably  just get pounded for the effort.</p><p>Several  minutes later he saw Kuno approach the school. The kendoist stopped  short as he saw his rival at school earlier than him. He drew his  bokken and posed in his usual manner.</p><p>"Foul  sorcerer, what manner of trickery is this? What kind of evil deeds  do you plan against the noble Blue Thunder?" Kuno reconsidered  his usual approach of charging headlong and instead approached Ranma  carefully. Ranma boggled.</p><p>Kuno  actually using his brain?</p><p>Ranma  watched warily as Kuno came closer, leading with his bokken, looking  around for the trap he was sure the vile Saotome had laid out. Kuno  was so engrossed in searching for the trap he didn't notice he had  stepped within kicking distance of Ranma. Ranma shook his head.</p><p>Guess  not.</p><p>Ranma  casually walked around until he was behind the kendoist.</p><p>When  Kuno reached the spot where he last saw Ranma standing he looked from  side to side in confusion.</p><p>"What  black magic is this? Where art thou, vile sorcerer? Thou art a  coward to run from the mighty Blue Thunder!"</p><p>"Kuno,  why doncha give it a rest? I really don't wanna pound you anymore."  Ranma tried to talk the elder Kuno sibling out of fighting. He was  rewarded with a swing of the bokken which Ranma ducked under.</p><p>Guess  it ain't no use talking to ya.</p><p>[Punt!]</p><p>He  kicked the senior away but this time instead of a random direction he  kicked Kuno towards the senior's third floor classroom. Might as  well try ta help him if I gotta pound him. Kuno hit the wall  beside the window, peeled off and fell down to the ground with a thud  while screaming "I fight on!" before falling unconscious.</p><p>Hmmm,  aim's a little off. Better get some training in.</p><p>He  turned around to see Akane and Nabiki round the corner toward school.  He started towards them.</p><p>Okay,  be more affectionate whatever that means.</p><p>"Ranchan!"</p><p>His  head whipped around to see Ukyo running towards him. He blinked as he  saw she was wearing a girl's uniform again. He noted the way the  other guys were staring at her, their mouths open and heads bobbing  up and down. Some had nose bleeds and several had passed out. It took  him a while to figure out why. Ukyo was a little 'bouncier' than  usual today. His brain shut down as soon as he realized Ukyo had  removed her chest bindings and was only wearing a bra to restrain her  generous chest. His mouth gaped, his head bobbed up and down and he  felt a nose bleed coming. With heroic effort he tore his eyes away  from the male fantasy to see Akane fuming at him from a few feet  away. Uh, oh.</p><p>"You  pervert! I saw what you were looking at!" Why can't you  look at me like that, you jerk? Am I really that bad to look at?  Akane's good mood that morning was ruined. She had promised herself  to be a lot nicer to Ranma after her talk with her sisters. She was  ready to apologize to Ranma that morning and even made him lunch but  something, as usual, sidetracked her.</p><p>Akane  was about to hit Ranma with her book bag when Ukyo latched onto one  of Ranma's arms. Ranma was acutely aware of the soft mounds pressing  into his arm. He repeated his mantra to take his mind off them.</p><p>Be  more affectionate. Be  more affectionate. Be  more affectionate.</p><p>"What  do you think you're doing?" Akane screeched at Ukyo.</p><p>[Sigh.]</p><p>"What  does it look like I'm doing? I'm hugging my fiance!" Ukyo  replied defiantly. Ukyo didn't really want to fight that morning.  Like Akane she was in a good mood and she didn't want to ruin it but  she'd be damned if she's going to let anyone stop her from showing  her affection towards her fiance. If they can't handle it then tough  luck to them. She hugged Ranma's arm tighter.</p><p>"Why  you..." Akane stalked towards Ukyo. She needed to release her  anger and decided to redirect it to another target. Where's Kuno  when you need him?</p><p>The  two ignored the crowd that was gathering while they glared at each  other. Ranma looked for an escape and saw Nabiki working the crowd  and could easily guess what it was about. Nabiki may have confessed  her feelings but that didn't stop her from plying her trade. A girl's  gotta do what a girl's gotta do to feed her family after all.</p><p>[Kring!  Kring!]</p><p>Ranma's  head jerked up at the sound. He looked around frantically for the  source. He turned around in time to see a purple blur streaking  towards him. He braced himself for impact.</p><p>[Glomp!]</p><p>Shampoo's  aim was flawless. She had her arms wrapped around Ranma's neck before  he knew it, bowling him over and tearing his arm away from Ukyo. She  landed on top of Ranma while her bicycle landed beside them.</p><p>Ranma  felt lost. He didn't know what to do. He wanted to be nice to his  fiancees but things were spinning way out of control. He cringed at  the inevitable brawl that was going to take place with him probably  in the middle of the crossfire.</p><p>Man,  and the day started out so well. Maybe this is what mom said to be  more assertive about.</p><p>"Good  morning, Airen! I'm so happy to see you!" Shampoo nuzzled his  neck and pressed her body against his. Shampoo was lost in her  happiness and it showed in the way she nuzzled. She just knew today  was the start of something wonderful between her and Ranma.</p><p>Ranma,  for his part, tried very hard not to react to the lips against his  neck or the two hard points poking into his chest but some things  were beyond conscious control. Shampoo's eyes widened as she felt  something poke her in her hips. Aiyah!</p><p>Shampoo  was about to get bolder when she was pulled off by an irate Akane and  Ukyo.</p><p>"Get  your hands off my fiance, you bimbo!" The shout came out eerily  in stereo. The crowd blinked. Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo blinked. Ranma  used the distraction to scramble to his feet away from ground zero  and adjust his pants.</p><p>Assertive,  gotta be assertive. How the heck do I do that without getting myself  killed?</p><p>"Did  you hear that? Akane just called Ranma her fiance!" came the  whispers from the crowd. Akane blushed beet red.</p><p>"Why  should I take my hands off my Airen? And who are you calling a  bimbo?" Shampoo retorted belligerently. She didn't appreciate  being pulled away from her Airen, especially when she felt him  responding to her advances in a very positive way.</p><p>"He  is not your Airen and I'm calling you a bimbo, bimbo!" Again  the shout came in stereo. Everyone blinked. Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo  paused.</p><p>"Man,  this is getting too weird even for us." Ukyo muttered. The  other two nodded. "Um, where were we?"</p><p>"You  two were calling Shampoo a bimbo." Nabiki helpfully reminded.  She had some bets riding on the coming fight. Ranma gave her a glare.  He was surprised when he saw Nabiki flinch a little. He rubbed his  eyes and looked again but Nabiki had turned away.</p><p>Must  have imagined it.</p><p>"Oh,  yeah. Thanks, sugar." Ukyo said to Nabiki's back.</p><p>"I  am not a bimbo! You both take that back or I'll teach you two a  lesson!" Shampoo waved her bonboris menacingly.</p><p>Wait  a minute! Does Shampoo sound funny today? Man, the day's getting  weirder and weirder.</p><p>"Make  me!" Ooohhh, that's in stereo again. Akane hefted her mallet  while Ukyo brandished her battle spatula. They began to circle each  other.</p><p>Ranma  debated whether it was worth risking his life and limb to jump in and  try to stop the catfight. He knew from first hand experience those  weapons felt awfully painful. He desperately looked around for  deliverance. Seeing none he said a silent prayer, quickly wrote his  last will and testament and jumped into the middle to stop the girls  just as the three charged each other. Banzai!</p><p>"Girls,  please, can't we talk about this? Can't we all just get along?  Aaahhh!" Ranma desperately tried to duck as he saw weapons  coming at him from three directions. Be more assertive my butt!</p><p>[Whack!]</p><p>[Bonk!  Bonk!]</p><p>[Smash!]</p><p>Three  guesses on who got hit with a giant battle spatula, a pair of  bonboris and an oversized mallet.</p><p>[Tweet!  Tweet! Tweet!]</p><p>The  last thing Ranma heard and saw before he lost consciousness were  three little yellow birds circling his head. He grinned stupidly at  the imaginary little birds.</p><p>"Pretty  birdies..."</p><p>[Thud!]</p><p>Ranma  fell face first into the dirt.</p><p>"Ranma!"</p><p>"Ranchan!"</p><p>"Airen!"</p><p>Three  pairs of hands went in to grab a single head. The result was a  mangled face as the three pairs pushed and pulled.</p><p>[Mangle!  Mangle!]</p><p>"Man,  Ranma gets all the luck! Imagine having three hot babes fighting over  him." Hiroshi commented to Daisuke.</p><p>[Mangle!  Mangle!]</p><p>"Yeah,  just look at the silly grin on his face!"</p><p>[Mangle!  Mangle!]</p><p>"Y'know,  I think he's fallen asleep."</p><p>[Mangle!  Mangle!]</p><p>"Leave  it to Saotome not to appreciate how lucky he is."</p><p>[Mangle!  Mangle!]</p><p>"The  world just isn't fair!"</p><p>"Get  your filthy hands off my fiance/airen!"</p><p>The  three began pushing each other away from Ranma while pulling Ranma in  three different directions. It would have been the end of our hero  were it not for the squeal loud enough to  be heard over the noise.</p><p>"Oh,  my! My son is so manly! Just look at how the girls fight for him!"  Hmmm... I should teach Ranma how to divide his time equally so  the girls don't fight.</p><p>Every  eye blinked and every head turned in the direction of the new voice.</p><p>"Auntie!"  Three voices chorused. Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo simultaneously  released their hold on Ranma and jumped back a step. Nodoka  approached them with a huge grin on her face, her ever present bundle  cradled in her arms.</p><p>[Thud!]</p><p>Ranma  again fell face first into the dirt. Nodoka did a quick check on her  son to make sure he was fine.</p><p>"Now,  now, girls. I know my son can have that effect on women but you  really shouldn't fight like that, especially in public. It's not very  ladylike" Nodoka gently admonished after she satisfied herself  that her son was unharmed. She genuinely liked the girls and would be  happy to call anyone of them daughter but like her son they needed  some work to smoothen out the rough edges. Oh, well. Nobody's  perfect.</p><p>The  three girls blushed furiously as they stammered  excuses and denials at the gentle rebuke. They shuffled their feet  nervously. The crowd began whispering again with this latest  development.</p><p>"Who's  the lady?"</p><p>"Is  she referring to Ranma as her son?"</p><p>"My  God! She's Ranma's mother?"</p><p>"Saotome  has a mother?"</p><p>"Yeah,  I thought he just spawned from his father."</p><p>[Bonk!]</p><p>"Don't  be an idiot!"</p><p>"Com'on,  she can't be Ranma's mom! I mean, just look at her!"</p><p>"Yeah,  I know what you mean. Can you imagine someone like her marrying  someone like Saotome's father? No way!"</p><p>"Growlf!"  # I heard that! #</p><p>"Yeah,  she's gorgeous! I wonder if she goes for younger men?"</p><p>Nodoka  slightly blushed as she heard the comment. Wild fantasies began  circulating in most male students.</p><p>"Perverts!  She's old enough to be your mother!"</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"Yeah.  Aren't girls always saying 'age doesn't matter'?"</p><p>"Just  think of what we can learn from her!"</p><p>"Ooohhh...!"  Wild fantasies just went up on the perversion scale. Nose bleeds  galore.</p><p>"Hey,  here comes Nabiki. Maybe she has some information on the lady."</p><p>"Maybe  she has some pictures!"</p><p>"Ooohhh!"</p><p>Sure  enough, Nabiki and her lieutenants were selling a booklet containing  the latest development in Nerima but no photos much to the  disappointment of the males.</p><p>"So,  she _is_ Ranma's mom." Came the disappointed conclusion. Male  fantasies vanished like soap bubbles popping.</p><p>"How  lucky can you get? Even Saotome's mom is a major babe!"</p><p>"Yeah,  I wish my mom was half as hot."</p><p>"He's  lucky he got his looks from his mom."</p><p>[Growlf!]  # I heard that! #</p><p>"The  world just ain't fair, I tell you!"</p><p>"Look  at the bright side. If Saotome's father can dupe a babe like her to  marry a dork like him then there's no reason why we can't do the  same. Not that we're dorks or anything." Daisuke said to  Hiroshi.</p><p>The  girls cringed at the comment. They shuddered at the thought of the  same fate befalling them. The boys had silly grins on their faces and  drool escaped their lips. They had hope!</p><p>"You  know what, Dai? That actually makes me feel better." Hiroshi  replied.</p><p>"Yeah!  Alright!" roared the males.</p><p>[Growlf!]  # I said I heard that! Damn it! Doesn't anyone read my goddamn  signs? #</p><p>"What's  this? Another goddess has come to grace the great Tatewaki Kuno with  her presence?" Kuno regained consciousness to see Nodoka  standing in front of Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo. He charged Nodoka with  open arms with his usual shout of "I shall date with thee!"</p><p>[Whack!]</p><p>[Bonk!  Bonk!]</p><p>[Smash!]</p><p>Guess  who was hit with a thrown battle spatula, two bonboris and an  oversized mallet?</p><p>"Don't  you even think about laying a finger on Auntie you pervert!"  The three owners of said weapons screamed. They proceeded to imitate  a herd of stampeding bull elephants over the fallen swordsman.</p><p>[Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!]</p><p>"Gee,  they must really like Ranma's mom, I've never seen the three of them  get along so well in something." Yuka commented to Sayuri.</p><p>[Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!]</p><p>"Yeah,  they're really getting into the groove now. Look at how they don't  get in each other's way and still stomp every part of senior Kuno."</p><p>[Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!]</p><p>"Shouldn't  someone stop them? Kuno's a jerk and pervert but that's just too  much."</p><p>[Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!]</p><p>"Maybe  a few minutes more."</p><p>[Crack!  Pop! Crackle! Snap! Crinkle!... Crinkle?] The sickening sounds came  from somewhere in the middle of the mini-dust storm at the feet of  the elephant wannabes.</p><p>"Oh,  my! Girls, I think that's quite enough." The three didn't seem  to hear as each was lost in their intent to impress the future  mother-in-law. They had seen how Nodoka dealt with a wayward male.</p><p>[Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!  Stomp! Stomp!]</p><p>Nodoka  finally had to physically pull the three girls off the flattened  figure with some help from Nabiki. Nodoka waited until they calmed  down.</p><p>"Eeeeeewwwwww!"  somebody said as they saw the remains of Kuno.</p><p>"Girls,  I am grateful that you would defend my honor but I am prefectly  capable of defending myself." Nodoka held up the wrapped  katana. "Besides I believe the boy was simply expressing his  manly intentions towards a desirable woman." Nodoka giggled  girlishly. Yes! I definitely still have it! She would have  pumped her right arm if she had some privacy.</p><p>"She  approves of perverted boys!" came the cheers from the male  student body.</p><p>The  four girls along with the rest of the female student body blinked.</p><p>"Um,  Auntie, I don't think you know how Kuno-baby there expresses his  manly intentions."</p><p>"He  seems to be a normal healthy young man with normal manly urges."</p><p>[Glomp!]</p><p>"At  last, the gods smile upon the great Blue Thunder. They have bestowed  upon my greatness a vision of loveliness that knows the way of true  love!" Everyone knew about Kuno's ability to recover. Perverts  always seem to have that.</p><p>Nodoka  stared down at the pair of hands now cupping her breasts. She spasmed  at the way Kuno rubbed his cheek against the back of her head.</p><p>"AAAIIIYYYEEEE!"</p><p>Before  anyone could blink Nodoka had broken out of the grasp of Kuno, turned  around, unwrapped and drawn her katana.</p><p>[Swish!  Slash! Swish! Slash! Swish! Slash! Swish! Slash! Swish! Slash!]</p><p>In  less than a second, Kuno was left standing in his boxers, his clothes  lying in tatters at his feet. Nodoka smoothly sheathed her sword and  calmly re-wrapped it. Kuno looked down at himself then at the remains  of his clothes and finally up at Nodoka. He smiled lecherously.</p><p>"Milady,  do you not think it is improper to be so forward in public? Methinks  such displays of affection should only be shown in a more private  setting."</p><p>The  collective facefault registered as an eight on the Richter  scale.</p><p>"Ah,  truly the sight of the magnificent physique of the great Tatewaki  Kuno overwhelms the adoring public." He proceeded to do some  poses he saw on a show called 'Johnny Bravo'. Interesting show for  something made by gaijins, the hero reminded Kuno of himself. One by  one the students threw up their breakfast.</p><p>[Punt!]</p><p>Akane,  Ukyo, Shampoo, Nabiki and Nodoka finally kicked the insane and  perverted kendoist away before any more students lost their morning  meal.</p><p>"I  shall date with theeeeeeee..."</p><p>Off  to one side hidden in some bushes a certain dimunitive and  incompetent but well-meaning ninja recorded the events on film.</p><p>Hmmm...  I must inform Mistress Kodachi as soon as possible. But first I have  to find Master Tatewaki.</p><p>Sasuke  snuck off as stealthily as he could.</p><p>"Sneaky  feet, sneaky feet, ninja feet."</p><p>"See  what I mean, Auntie?" Nabiki reminded while taking note of the  ninja's departure. Well, Kodachi should make her appearance to  Auntie soon.</p><p>"Yes,  perhaps the young Mr. Kuno was a little too forward in showing his  manly urges."</p><p>"Perhaps?"  Nabiki echoed, not sure whether she understood Ranma's mother  correctly.</p><p>"Well,  yes. Were it not for the fondling, what the Kuno boy did were simply  expressions of his manliness." The girls blink, blink together.  Now if only Ranma could learn a thing or two from the Kuno lad.  A shiver passed through her son's body jolting Ranma into  wakefulness. He groggily sat up and groaned.</p><p>"Ugh.  Did anyone get the plate of the truck that hit me?"</p><p>"Ranma!"</p><p>"Ranchan!"</p><p>"Airen!"</p><p>"Aaarrrggghhh!"  it was the cry of someone being crushed in three bone breaking  glomps.</p><p>[Pop!  Pop! Pop!]</p><p>"Ah,  you three might want to ease up a little. Ranma's turning a little  blue." said boy in distress shot a grateful glance at Nabiki.  Said boy then became confused as he saw said girl blush.</p><p>Did  I just see Nabiki blush? Further thoughts on the matter were  derailed as the more important matter of getting oxygen into his  lungs occupied his mind when he was released from the death trap.</p><p>[Gasp!]</p><p>"Oh,  sorry, Ranma/Ranchan/Airen! So sorry!"</p><p>Ranma  held up his hand. "I'll be [Gasp!] fine in a [Gasp!] minute.  Just need [Gasp!] to get my [Gasp!] breath back [Gasp!] and my ribs  [Gasp!] back into place. [Gasp!]"</p><p>After  a minute of deep breaths and popping his ribs back into place Ranma  stood up shakily.</p><p>"So  what hit me? More importantly, did I win?"</p><p>His  three fiancees sheepishly held up their respective weapons.</p><p>"Oh.  How?" He couldn't recall much. Must have a concussion or  something.</p><p>"You  stepped in to try and stop the girls from tearing each other a new  hole over you. You got hit in the crossfire." Nabiki helpfully  supplied.</p><p>"Oh,  my! My son is so manly to try and stop the girls from fighting over  him!"</p><p>Ranma  staggered forward as if hit by a sledgehammer  and his eyes bulged at hearing the voice that came from behind him.  No, please, don't tell me she's here! He slowly turned around  and saw what every teenager didn't want to see in school. A doting  parent. He groaned inwardly. He had seen and snickered at how the  other parents had embarrased his classmates with their antics. He  escaped the same fate only because his pop was anything but a doting  parent. This can get ugly.</p><p>"Mom!  What a pleasant surprise. Watcha doin' here in Furinkan?" Of  all places. It was said in a tone teenagers all over the world  use when they see their parents where they didn't want to see them.  He can already hear the snickers from the crowd of high school  students. This is not good.</p><p>"Why,  Ranma? Why else would I be here except for you?" Ranma cringed  as his mother approached to give him a bear hug and a peck on his  cheek.</p><p>"Mom!"  Ranma tried to get out of the bear hug without hurting his mother.  Fat chance of that.</p><p>Nodoka  looked puzzled at the reaction of her son, oblivious to the  increasing snickers from the crowd and the amused looks on her son's  girlfriends. "Is anything wrong, son?" She didn't let go  of the hug.</p><p>Ranma  was panicking and he began to sweat. He had to do something before...  but what? He was new at this mother-son thing and he didn't want to  hurt his mom. If it was his pop he'd break the older man's arms off  without a second thought. He'd even break both legs just for the heck  of it. He shivered at the memory of the 'Cradle From Hell' technique.  Ranma could already see the amused looks on his classmates and could  guess what they were snickering about. He looked at his fiancees  pleading for help. They all smiled back benignly. Ooohhh. Wait  til I sic my mom on you.</p><p>"Ranma?  Is anything the matter? You look distressed? Why are you shivering?"  Nodoka released Ranma but her son's relief was short-lived as she  pulled his head down to touch his forehead. "You don't feel  feverish but you're shivering and all sweaty." Nodoka pulled  out a hankerchief from her kimono's sleeves and dabbed Ranma's  forehead and face delicately. The snickers increased in volume.</p><p>"ggguuurrrgggllleee..."</p><p>"What  was that son? You don't sound well. Maybe you shouldn't go to school  today."</p><p>I'll  never live this humiliation down. Ranma forced himself not to cry  in despair. What came out was a grimace. Too bad Nodoka  misinterpreted the expression.</p><p>"Oh,  my! Are you hurt, son? Where does it hurt?" Nodoka hugged her  son again and cried out for everyone to hear. "OH, MY POOR  _BABY_!" A sudden stillness descended over the entire school.</p><p>[Wooooo...]</p><p>A  gust of wind swept a few leaves from the grounds. The stillness was  broken by the sound of a Ranma statue slowly cracking.</p><p>His  fiancees finally couldn't take it anymore and fell down laughing  while holding their sides. This set off the rest of the school  population to laugh hysterically.</p><p>Nodoka  obliviously continued fussing over her son with motherly pride.</p><p>After  several minutes of side-splitting laughter the school administrators,  who had avidly watched the proceedings below from windows of the  school building, remembered they had a school to run and rang the  bell thirty minutes later than regulations. The students streamed  into their classrooms and the school day began.</p><p>After  Ranma's mother made the three of them promise they wouldn't fight  over Ranma anymore, Akane and Ukyo supported the still stuporous  pig-tailed boy into the school building leaving Nodoka, Nabiki and  Shampoo on the school grounds. Panda-Genma headed off to the Tendo  Dojo to hang out with Soun.</p><p>"So,  Auntie, what brings you to Furinkan?"</p><p>"Oh,  I'm just checking on my son's education. Shouldn't you two be in  class as well?"</p><p>"I  think I can spare some time showing a student's parent around."</p><p>"What  about you Shampoo?"</p><p>"I  don't go to school, Auntie. Great-grandmother said I don't need to go  to school here and she needs help at the restaurant." Shampoo  replied in a sad voice. She wanted to go to school. It would give her  more time to spend with her Airen.</p><p>"I  see." A pause "Do you want to go to school, Shampoo?"</p><p>Shampoo  nodded hesitantly. She wanted to go to school but she also didn't  want to leave her great-grandmother alone. "I want to go,  Auntie but who'll help great-grandmother?"</p><p>"You're  a good girl, Shampoo. I'll talk to Elder Cologne and see what I can  do."</p><p>"Really,  Auntie?" Shampoo asked hopefully.</p><p>"I  will, Shampoo, but don't get your hopes up. Will Elder Cologne be at  your restaurant the whole morning?"</p><p>"Yes,  Auntie. I don't think she has any outside appointments."</p><p>"I  see. I will pass by later after I am through here."</p><p>"I'll  tell great-grandmother you're coming. I'm sure she'll be happy to see  you."</p><p>"Thank  you, Shampoo. Now head on along so I can finish my business here  faster."</p><p>"Aiyah!  So long, Auntie!" Shampoo excitedly picks up her bicycle and  zooms off towards the Nekohanten.</p><p>"So  Auntie, where would you like to go to first?" Nabiki started  walking towards the school building alongside the older woman.</p><p>"The  school office for a start. I'd like to see Ranma's grades for  myself."</p><p>That  caused Nabiki to stop.</p><p>"Um,  you wouldn't have any, uh, unrealistic expectations of Ranma's grades  would you, Auntie?"</p><p>"What  do mean, Nabiki?"</p><p>"Um,  like Ranma getting passing grades?"</p><p>"Come  now, Nabiki, I'm sure you're exaggerating. Even though my husband  neglected my son's schooling, Ranma couldn't be that bad."</p><p>"Um,  right." Nabiki decided not to say anymore. She had seen Ranma's  grades and she still couldn't believe anyone could get grades that  bad. Except for Kuno, she corrected. Oh, well. She'll be  there to help Auntie get through the trauma.</p><p>"Can  you believe it? Ranma's a mama's boy!" One boy whispered to  Daisuke and Hiroshi.</p><p>"Yeah,  the great Ranma Saotome! Who would have thunk it?" Hiroshi  replied.</p><p>"Not  a mama's boy, but a mama's baby! Har! Har!" Daisuke put in.</p><p>"Heck,  I wouldn't mind being babied by someone as hot as Saotome's mom!"</p><p>[Snork!  Snork!]</p><p>"Ooohhh...  Don't you think its just adorable?" One girl said to another.</p><p>"Yeah,  I'd like to _baby_ him myself."</p><p>"And  how would you baby him?"</p><p>"Well,  you know how you need to feed a baby every now and then?" The  girl looked at her chest meaningfully.</p><p>"You  wouldn't?"</p><p>"Wouldn't  I?"</p><p>"Me,  I'd like to change his diapers myself!"</p><p>"Ooohhh!  You naughty girl you!"</p><p>[Squeal!  Squeal!]</p><p>In  his seat Ranma felt his cheeks burn and tried to shrink behind the  textbook he had opened. Although no one dared to say it to his face  he could hear the whispers clearly enough.</p><p>From  their seats Akane and Ukyo looked at their mutual fiance with  amusement and sympathy. They were about to go over to console him but  their teacher made his entrance and their first class of the day  began. Soon after that Ranma was fast asleep at his desk, his  embarassment forgotten for the time being.</p><p>The  piece of carboard called a report card fell from the lifeless fingers  of a mother whose pride over her child had just been dealt a blow.  Nodoka Saotome stared into space with a blank look, her jaw slack and  face pale and sickly. She wobbled momentarily on her feet before  Nabiki was able to steady her.</p><p>"No."  Nodoka whispered. "It can't be true. It's too horrible!"  She looked down at the school administrator wearing a hawaiian shirt  and bermuda shorts who gave her the report card. She suddenly grabbed  the poor office worker by his shirt collar and hauled him to his  feet. Her eyes blazed.</p><p>"Is  this some kind of sick joke? My son can't have grades _that_ bad!"  She indicated the piece of cardboard on the floor. Classic case of  denial.</p><p>"Kah!  Kah!" The man tried to talk through the constriction at his  throat.</p><p>"Uh,  Auntie, he'd be able to answer you if you let him breath a little."</p><p>Nodoka  blinked. She saw the fear in the man's eyes a few inches from her  own. She dropped him like a hot potato.</p><p>"Oh,  dear. What have I done?" She bowed and apologized to the man.  "I'm so sorry. I didn't mean any harm. I don't know what came  over me."</p><p>The  man took several seconds to recover his breath and nerves.</p><p>"Quite  alright, ma'am. I'm sure it would have been a shock to anyone. In  fact you handled it much better than most people."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Yes,  ma'am. Most people would faint, run away screaming, laugh  hysterically or simply lose their sanity when they see those grades.  That's why we keep your son's and Mr. Kuno's report cards in a  special safe marked 'Extremely Hazardous' and under very tight  security. They can be very dangerous weapons in the hands of the  wrong people."</p><p>"Then...  then these grades of my son are real?"</p><p>"Yes,  they're very real I'm afraid. If they weren't they wouldn't have the  effects I mentioned."</p><p>"How,  why?"</p><p>"It  would be best if you saw for yourself what your son does in class. I  would be happy to escort you but I have many things to take care of  here." The man turned to Nabiki. "Ms. Tendo, can you  escort Mrs. Saotome around the school? I'll give you a pass to give  to your homeroom teacher."</p><p>"Sure,  I'd be happy to tour Auntie around."</p><p>"Alright,  just a moment while I prepare the pass." The man wrote  something on a piece of paper. "Here."</p><p>"Um,  is the principal around?"</p><p>The  man looked around surreptitiously. "No, I  haven't seen him yet. Thank God."</p><p>"Thanks.  Don't want anymore surprises." With that Nabiki led Nodoka to  Ranma's classroom.</p><p>Nodoka  was puzzled at the last exchange but decided it was no concern of  hers. She followed Nabiki.</p><p>Nodoka  fumed as she looked into her son's classroom where she saw Ranma fast  asleep with a smile at his desk. Her anger grew when she saw Akane  and Ukyo try to wake him subtlely when they saw her without success.  It seemed he enjoyed sleeping in class too much. She knocked on the  door to get the teacher's attention and asked him if she could talk  to her son.</p><p>"Can  someone wake Mr. Mama's Boy [snicker] from his nap. His mama  [snicker] wants to talk to him." That elicited snickers from  the class. They really enjoyed the spectacle that morning.</p><p>"Baby,  sir, Mama's Baby."</p><p>"Yes,  yes. Baby. Can someone wake Mama's baby?"<p></p><p>Laughter  filled the classroom but died out when they saw Ranma stirring.</p><p>"Wha?  Whassup?" He noticed everyone was looking out the door. He  followed their gazes and paled when he saw his mother standing  outside with her arms crossed over her chest. She was looking  directly at him with an angry expression on her face. He gulped.  What did I do now?</p><p>"Mr.  Saotome, your mother wants to have a word with you. You may step  outside." And may God have mercy on your soul. The  teacher had seen that look on a parent's face countless times before  and every time things didn't turn out well for the teenager  concerned.</p><p>Ranma  walked towards his mother with trepidation. Every step seemed weighed  down with lead weights. His danger senses screamed for him to turn  and run for his life but something made him continue.</p><p>"Ranma  please close the door and follow me." His mother told him once  he had stepped outside the classrom. "Nabiki-chan, thank you  for your help. If you don't mind I would like to have some words with  my son in private." Nabiki nodded and shot a sympathetic look  to the doomed boy before turning to head back to her classroom.  Mother and son began to walk in silence.</p><p>Nodoka  led her son outside. She was angry and disappointed. She was angry at  Ranma for the disrespect he showed towards his teacher, his  classmates and the school by sleeping in class. She was disappointed  at his attitude of casually disregarding his education. The grades  didn't matter anymore. It had upset her, yes, but if that was what  her son was _truly_ capable of then she can come to accept it.  However what she saw was that Ranma didn't even bother to put some  effort into his studies. If he didn't care for school then why come  here at all? He could sleep all he want at home and not be a  distraction for others and an embarassment to their family.</p><p>She  sighed. She did not want to be angry at her son, not after being  separated for ten long years but she knew she had to correct his  behavior.</p><p>How  do I go about that without alienating him from me?</p><p>She  sighed again and reined in her anger. Shouting at her son in anger  will not help any. She needed to talk to him, to learn the reason why  he behaved that way.</p><p>Nodoka  at last stopped under a tree to one side of the school field. She  turned around to face her son. Ranma breathed a sigh of relief on  seeing the anger gone from his mother's face but didn't dare utter a  word and waited for his mother to speak.</p><p>Nodoka  chose her words carefully, the walk having helped her calm herself.  If she was to help her son then she must not turn him away from her.  "Ranma, my son, I know your father does not put much value into  education, even regarding it as a distraction from the Art. Do you  share his opinion?"</p><p>"Mom?"</p><p>Nodoka  rephrased her question. "How do you feel about your education?  About going to school?"</p><p>"School's  boring, mom. Don't see how what they teach's gonna help me be the  best martial artist. Don't see why I gotta go to school."</p><p>"Is  that all that matters, my son? To be the best martial artist?"</p><p>Ranma  was puzzled. "Pops always said that's the only thing that  mattered. That's the reason why we went on that training journey in  the first place. Should there be anything else that matters, mom?"</p><p>"Yes,  many things like family, friends and loved ones."</p><p>Ranma's  face tightened. "Only had pops for family, mom. Pops never  mentioned ya, not even where ya lived or that ya were alive. Didn't  have much time for friends 'cause pops wouldn't let me. Never ever  had loved ones. Pops and the Art were the only things I had until ya  found us, mom."</p><p>Nodoka's  stepped back as if she had been slapped. "I... I see."  Her son's revelation had come as a shock. She began to see the kind  of training and life her husband subjected her son to. How could  Genma go to those lengths? How could he strip my son of his family,  of friends, of everything for martial arts? Did he care for nothing  but the Art? Did he even care for Ranma? She staggered and paled  as the horror of her own culpability dawned on her. My God! What  have I done? What have I condemned my son to? I should never have  agreed to that journey!</p><p>"Mom,  ya okay?" Ranma was worried. His mother acted as if she was  struck by a blow. Her pallor only increased his worry,</p><p>"I,  I'm okay, Ranma. I just need to think." What do I do now?  How can I ever make it up to Ranma for everything he suffered and  endured? "Perhaps it would be best for us to go home now."  (1)</p><p>"Eh?"  Ranma was even more puzzled. "What about school?" He  didn't really care about school but he had friends or at least people  his age to talk to and hang out with here.</p><p>"As  you have said, Ranma, school does not matter. I do not want anything  to distract you from your quest to be the best Martial Artist ever."  Nodoka paused. "That is what you want, is it not?"</p><p>"What  I want?"</p><p>"Yes,  is it not? This way you will be able to practice the Art the whole  day with nothing to distract you."</p><p>"Whole  day?" Sure, Ranma didn't want to go to school but to do nothing  but practice the whole day? At home? By himself? No friends or chance  to make some new ones? That he definitely didn't want. Sure he had  his mom and pops to be with but it just wasn't the same. And he  didn't need or wanted to practice the whole day anyway. "Um,  yeah, that sounds great, mom, but ya know what they say 'all play and  no work makes Ranma a dull boy'." That didn't sound right.</p><p>[Sigh.]  "Ranma, it's 'all work and no play makes Ranma a dull boy' and  school is not a place to play in. You can play and hang out with your  friends after school or on weekends when they do not have their  studies to attend to." He isn't overjoyed he doesn't have  to go to school? Maybe all is not yet lost.</p><p>"But..."  It wouldn't be the same, what would we talk about? It's hard  enough as it is with not much in common.</p><p>"Ranma,  do you want to stay in school?"</p><p>"Um,  yeah?" It's better than to stay at home the whole day with  pops.</p><p>"Ranma,  if you want to stay in school you will have to behave properly."</p><p>Ranma  scrunched his eyebrows. "Uh, how am I supposed to behave?"</p><p>"For  one, you shouldn't sleep in class. It's distracting and  disrespectful."</p><p>"I  can't help it, mom. The teachers are boring!"</p><p>"Nevertheless,  it's not proper behavior. Not only are you disrespecting your  teachers, you are distracting the other students who want to learn.  If you cannot stop yourself from falling asleep then you might as  well do it at home."</p><p>Ranma  thought about that. It made sense. If he had fallen asleep while  training under the various Martial Arts Masters he had trained under  he probably would been given a very painful reprimand. And staying at  home the whole day didn't appeal to him. "Um, okay, mom. I'll  try."</p><p>"Not  good enough, Ranma. It's either sleep or not sleep." Nodoka  will not budge on this. If her son wanted to go to school then he has  to be serious about it.</p><p>Ranma  grimaced then nodded. "Uh, what else should I do?"</p><p>"Aside  from sleeping you will not do anything that will be a distraction  like eating and talking while you have classes."</p><p>"Um,  sure, I can handle that."</p><p>"And  you will listen to your teachers and do your best in your studies."</p><p>"What  for? Ain't got no use for what they teach."</p><p>"Ranma,  do you trust me? Do you trust your mother?"</p><p>"Of  course, mom! Why wouldn't I?"</p><p>Because  we've only been reunited for a day and because I was not a better  mother to you. "Then trust me, my son, when I say there is  no honor in not giving your best. It is for your own good for you to  always do your best in whatever you do, including school. It may not  be apparent now but one day you will realize the importance of a good  education."</p><p>Ranma  looked at his mother. He saw and felt the sincerity on her face and  in her voice. So unlike his father who used insults and physical  abuse to motivate him. He slowly nodded. It wasn't an unreasonable or  dangerous request from his mother anyway.</p><p>"Sure,  mom, I'll do what ya say."</p><p>"Thank  you, Ranma." Nodoka settled for that. It was a start and she  can work with that. "Now you better return to your class. We  don't want you missing out on your lessons."</p><p>"Uh,  what about ya, mom? Where ya going now?"</p><p>"I  promised Shampoo that I will drop by the Nekohanten to speak with  Elder Cologne. After that I'll go to the Tendo Dojo to pick up your  father before going home."</p><p>"Oh,  okay. Be careful mom."</p><p>"Thank  you, son, I will. You go along now and I'll see you this afternoon at  home." Ranma turned to go. "And Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah,  mom?"</p><p>"Remember  your promise."</p><p>"I  will, mom."</p><p>Ranma  went to his seat after the teacher gave him permission to re-enter  the classroom. He knew everyone was looking at him, wondering whether  they should be worried or not. He looked down at the textbook on his  desk and wondered about what his mother had said. He couldn't find  anything wrong with what she said. She didn't force him to stay in  school. It was his choice and it surprised him he actually chose to  stay in school. He debated whether it would be worth the effort. He  shrugged.</p><p>I  can always quit later.</p><p>He  blinked. He shook his head. That wasn't a good attitude.</p><p>I  ain't a quitter.</p><p>It  was either he continued until he won at the end or he didn't start at  all. No half-measures. He looked around and saw his classmates still  looking at him, curiosity clearly in their  eyes. He smirked to himself.</p><p>Probably  worried why I haven't fallen asleep yet.</p><p>Was  it really worth all the effort just to be able to stay with his  classmates? He didn't know the answer to that one but he did know  staying at home doing nothing appealed to him even less. It was  probably what his lazy panda of a father would do. He blinked. Of  course! It just wasn't because he wanted to stay with his classmates.  It was also because he didn't want to be like his stupid, lazy  father! He smirked visibly this time, oblivious to the collective  cringe of his teacher and classmates his smirk elicited.</p><p>His  decision made he squared his shoulders, straightened his back and  brought out a notebook and pencil from his book bag. He opened his  textbook to the page he saw his neighbor had her textbook opened to.  He looked at his teacher expectantly and prepared to listen and take  notes. He ignored the massive face faults and waited patiently for  his teacher and classmates to recover their wits.</p><p>He  would make his mother proud.</p><p>Nodoka  walked towards the Nekohanten absorbed in her thoughts. Her brief  talk with her son at his school had unsettled her greatly. One  thought rang again and again in her mind.</p><p>Only  had pops for family.</p><p>Every  time it was like a knife through her heart. Every time it reminded  her she was the one who let her husband take her only child away from  her.</p><p>Why  wouldn't my own husband tell my own son about his mother? Does he  think my very existence would be a distraction for Ranma?</p><p>Her  husband couldn't be that heartless, could he? Stupid, ignorant,  careless, irresponsible, lazy, glutton, greedy, selfish, coward, fat,  bald, dishonest, dishonorable, disreputable. All that, yes. But  heartless? (2)</p><p>No  time for friends? Nothing else matters?</p><p>She  never thought her husband would take Ranma's training to _that_  extreme.</p><p>My  husband is that stupid?</p><p>It  bothered her greatly. It bode nothing good for her son to have  nothing but martial arts in his life even if he was the greatest  ever. If she had known beforehand the stupidity her husband was  capable of she would never have agreed to the training trip. She  sighed once again. No matter how much she wanted to blame her husband  she knew she was not blameless for agreeing to the trip in the first  place and then letting herself to be convinced not to accompany them.  Even if she did have Ranma's best interests in mind at the time. The  guilt weighed heavily on her.</p><p>A  lesser woman would have broken down crying, guilt-ridden and doubting  her worth as a mother for allowing her only child to be taken away.  But Nodoka knew that was counter-productive. If Ranma had blamed her  for all that went wrong in his life then she would have broken and  taken her own life but he did not and she was eternally grateful for  that. She now had a second chance at raising her son and she will not  waste it wallowing in self-recrimination. When the time comes when  she had to pay for her mistakes then so be it. She will face it like  a true samurai. Until then she will make every moment count in  raising her son and correcting the mistakes she had made.</p><p>What  else did that stupid husband of mine do and teach to my son? And what  can I do to correct them?</p><p>She  decided as she reached the Nekohanten that a long talk between her  and her son was in order for later that day. She would have to get  rid of Genma then and for as long possible. Perhaps her husband would  like to spend a night out on the town with his friend Soun. As an  incentive she would give him some spending money. The time the money  would buy for her to spend quality time with her son alone would make  it money well spent.</p><p>Perhaps  it is time I made use of the other account.</p><p>She  decided to contact her broker friend. With the plan firmly in her  head she opened the door and stepped inside the restaurant.</p><p>Cologne  was sipping tea patiently waiting for Nodoka to arrive at one of the  tables. She could afford to relax as it was the time of day that the  Nekohanten wasn't busy with customers. She had sent both Shampoo and  Mousse out on errands as she did not want any distractions in her  talk with Mrs. Saotome. She looked at the door at the sound of the  chimes to see Nodoka stepping in.</p><p>"Ah,  Mrs. Saotome. It is a pleasure to see you again so soon."</p><p>"Please,  Elder Cologne, it would honor me if you called me Nodoka." She  bowed low to the older woman.</p><p>My,  such respect for one's elders. A pity she was not the one to raise  Ranma.</p><p>"As  it would me if you would call me Cologne. There is no need for  formalities between us." She gestured for Nodoka to sit at her  table and offered her tea. "Now then, Nodoka, I am curious as  to the reason you wished to speak with me. Shampoo seemed happy with  the news."</p><p>"Ah,  yes. I spoke with Shampoo earlier at Furikan and she told me she does  not attend school. May I inquire as to the reason why, Elder?"  Nodoka was not comfortable with addressing the Amazon Matriarch in  informal terms. She commanded respect and Nodoka could not help but  give it.</p><p>Cologne  cocked her head to one side. "Simply because I see no reason to  enroll Shampoo in Japan's schools. I am proud to say that despite the  remoteness and lack of modern conveniences of our village, Shampoo  can read and write Mandarin very well. She is also very well versed  in our history and culture, knows the rudiments of traditional and  herbal medicine and has the basics of mathematics and geography. You  may also have noticed Shampoo speaks Japanese fluently. "</p><p>Nodoka  nodded, her respect for Amazon society rising. "I am impressed  by the breadth of knowledge Shampoo possesses and it is a tribute to  your society, Elder. From a purely educational standpoint I also see  no need to enroll Shampoo in our school system. However I believe  Shampoo will benefit greatly by attending Furinkan. She will be able  to learn more of her fiance's culture not only from the teachers but  also by interacting with people her age. She will also be able to  spend more time with Ranma and the other girls." She paused.  "And she has expressed a desire to do so."</p><p>"Oh?"  That was news to Cologne. Shampoo had never asked to enroll in  Furinkan.</p><p>"Yes,  she told me herself but she never brought up the subject with you  because she felt it was her duty to stay with you in the restaurant.  She is a wonderful great-granddaughter to put her wishes behind her  concern for her great-grandmother."</p><p>"Yes,  she is. You do not fear that she will be prejudiced against?"</p><p>"There  is that danger but I am confident Ranma and the other girls will  allow no harm to come to Shampoo. I believe the benefits outweigh the  risks."</p><p>"Very  well, I will consider your suggestion."</p><p>"That  is all that I ask, Matriarch. I only ask for Shampoo's benefit."</p><p>"That  I believe, child. I will speak with Shampoo as soon as she returns."  Poor child. Her motherly instincts must be crying out for release  after ten years of being bottled up.</p><p>"Thank  you, Matriarch." Nodoka stood. "I take your leave as I  still have other appointments to keep."</p><p>Cologne  held up a hand. "How are you and son-in-law coming along,  Nodoka?"</p><p>Nodoka  sat down again and sighed. "As well as can be expected, Elder.  We still have much to talk about."</p><p>"I  sense something bothers you?"</p><p>"It  seems my husband has not been a good father to my son."</p><p>Cologne  snorted. "That I can agree with whole-heartedly." She  paused for a second. "If I may ask, why did you allow Genma to  take Ranma on that training journey? I admit I am impressed with the  results of the journey but..."</p><p>"Yes,  I know, Matriarch." Nodoka sighed again and her shoulders  sagged a little more. "I allowed Genma to take Ranma away from  me because I felt at the time it was in Ranma's best interest. I am  beginning to see that may not have been my wisest decision. There is  no doubt in my mind that Ranma is an impressive Martial Artist as  Genma promised, arguably the best of his generation. However I can  not help but feel it came at too high a price for Ranma and I feel I  am partly to blame for that. If only I had made a better decision. If  only I had been a better mother to him."</p><p>Cologne  saw the anguish in the younger woman's eyes.</p><p>"Do  not be too hard on yourself, child. We are only human and we all make  mistakes big and small. Even now with more than three-hundred years  of experience I still make the most foolish of mistakes."</p><p>Cologne  grimaced as she remembered the cat-tongue technique she used on  Ranma. She badly misjudged Ranma at the time. Then Happosai had  handed her a golden opporutnity to atone for that mistake. She had  hoped by teaching Ranma the Hiryu Shoten Ha and helping him regain  his strength stolen by Happosai she had done enough to correct that  error. Only time will tell. She only prayed that she did cost Shampoo  her happiness with Ranma.</p><p>"What  I will say to you is this. We may regret our error all we want but  regret will not correct the error."</p><p>Cologne  saw Nodoka's eyes harden with resolve.</p><p>"Ah,  I am impressed to see for someone as young as you to already  understand this. I look forward to the future of son-in-law with you  there to guide him." And perhaps he will be the greatest  martial artist of all time, greater than myself or the cursed  Happosai.</p><p>"Thank  you, Elder, for understanding. I can do no less for my son."  Nodoka paused. "Elder, I brought to Ranma's attention what you  told me yesterday. That you and Shampoo would not mind Ranma marrying  Shampoo by Amazon Law alone."</p><p>"Oh?  And?"</p><p>"I  do not know if you will be pleased, Elder, but he refused. He said  that would be fine if they were going to stay in your village but he  and Shampoo will probably stay here in Japan. He says Shampoo  deserves to be married to him properly by Japanese Law."</p><p>"I  see."</p><p>"I  believe my son cares for your great-granddaughter as he does for all  the girls, Matriarch, and that he holds their interests above that of  his own. He does not want anyone to challenge his commitment to any  of the girls."</p><p>Cologne  smiled "I expected no less from son-in-law. Indeed, he is the  man for Shampoo."</p><p>"Thank  you, Matriarch, for understanding again. I only pray that there will  be a happy ending for all of us at the end."</p><p>"As  will I, child, but there is a saying in the west: God helps those who  help themselves. We will do our best to have a happy ending, ne?"  Cologne smiled conspiratorily.</p><p>"Of  course, Matriarch, of course." Nodoka stood and bowed again. "I  am afraid I must go, Elder, if I am to keep my other appointments."</p><p>Cologne  nodded again. "Safe journey, child."</p><p>"Thank  you, Elder." Nodoka continued on her way to the Tendo Dojo to  pick up her husband leaving Cologne to ponder on whether to enroll  Shampoo or not.</p><p>Perhaps  it will do Shampoo good and there is nothing to lose. If Shampoo says  she wants to enroll at Furinkan then I will enroll her.</p><p>Nodoka  reached the Tendo home thirty minutes later after making a short stop  at an automated teller machine. Kasumi as usual opened the door.</p><p>"Good  morning, Auntie."</p><p>"Good  morning, Kasumi. Is my husband here?"</p><p>"Why  yes, Auntie. Uncle Genma is playing shogi with father in the living  room." Kasumi led Nodoka into the house where they found Soun  and Genma at their usual spot at the porch. Soun rose to greet his  new guest while Kasumi went into the kitchen to get some tea. Genma  waited a moment to rearrange the pieces to his liking before rising  as well.</p><p>"Nodoka,  welcome to my home."</p><p>"Thank  you, Soun."</p><p>"Nodoka,  are we going home already?" Genma didn't want to go home yet.  He was having fun with his friend. Nodoka didn't miss the reluctance  in his voice.</p><p>"No,  not yet. In fact why don't you take Soun out?"</p><p>"Eh?"  Genma didn't think he heard right.</p><p>"Think  of it as partial thanks for the hospitality he extended to you and  Ranma." Nodoka slipped Genma the money she withdrew from the  ATM. Genma's eyes widen as he saw the amount Nodoka gave him. "Now  why don't you two enjoy yourselves?"</p><p>Genma  wasn't the brightest bulb in the world but he knew enough not to look  a gift horse in the mouth. He quickly grabbed Soun and ran out of the  house before his wife could change her mind and take back the cash.</p><p>"Oh,  my. Where did father and Uncle Saotome go?" Kasumi asked from  the door into the kitchen.</p><p>"I  gave my husaband some money and told him to treat your father out to  thank your father partially for the generosity he extended to him and  Ranma. I don't think they'll return until later tonight if not  tomorrow morning." Nodoka smiled to herself. Getting rid of her  husband was easier than she had thought.</p><p>"Oh.  What will I do till then?"</p><p>"Don't  you have friends to go out with, Kasumi?"</p><p>"I've  never had a lot of time to make friends much less go out with them  with all my responsibilities here at home, Auntie." Kasumi said  a little sadly.</p><p>"I  see." The poor dear. It must have been hard on her.  "Well, why don't we go out ourselves then? It's been a long  time since I went shopping with someone."</p><p>"I  don't know, Auntie. Who'll take care of the house?" Kasumi  paused and continued more hesitantly with head slightly bowed. "And  I don't have much money."</p><p>"I'm  sure the house will be fine, Kasumi, and it'll be my treat. It's the  least I can for someone who took good care of my family for several  months. Now why don't you go along and change while I take care of  things down here." Nodoka indicated the shogi board and cups  her husband and Soun left.</p><p>"Oh,  no, Auntie. It wouldn't be right for a guest to clean up."</p><p>"Nonsense,  Kasumi. You've done this for my husband and son for several months.  It's the least I can do in return. Now go along, dear." Nodoka  shooed the reluctant Kasumi away. She quickly put away the shogi  board and cups left behind by the two men. By the time she finished  Kasumi had changed into one of her modest dresses.</p><p>Oh,  dear. That dress just wouldn't do. How can she hope to attract young  men wearing something that? It hides too much of her.</p><p>"Ready,  Kasumi?"</p><p>"Yes,  Auntie."</p><p>"Then  let's go." Nodoka took hold of one of Kasumi's arms. "I  know of this nice little dress shop where I'm sure you'll find some  nice dresses." She practically dragged the bewildered girl out  of the door. This is so much fun! I finally get to play dress  up! A gleam came into the woman's eyes. I wonder if Ranma  would let me dress up his girl side? Somewhere out there, someone  felt a shiver go down his spine.</p><p>One  hour later found Kasumi wearing one of the dresses Nodoka had picked  out for her.</p><p>Very  nice. Very, very nice. "Do you like it, Kasumi?"</p><p>"Oh,  yes, Auntie!" The girl questioned gushed. It was still modest  by most standards but somehow it made her feel more... like a woman.  "Do you... do you think Ranma would like me in this?" Her  hands flew to her mouth when she realized what she just asked. She  didn't mean to ask the question but it came out nonetheless.</p><p>Nodoka's  eyebrows arched questioningly. Ranma? Why would Kasumi... oh,  my! Her eyes widened. My son is so manly! "I'm sure  my son will like it Kasumi. It really brings out your femininity."  Now that's an understatement. "If you don't mind,  Kasumi, why do you ask if my son would like it?"</p><p>Kasumi  blushed a deep scarlet, a fact not lost on the Saotome matriarch. She  uncharacteristically stuttered. "I-I-I... oh, I'm so  embarrased!" Kasumi hid her face in her hands.</p><p>The  poor dear, she's so shy. Maybe this isn't the place for me to ask  such personal questions of her. "It's alright, Kasumi, if  you're too embarassed to answer." Nodoka stood and brought the  other dresses she and Kasumi picked to the cashier. They all  looked so nice on her it'd be a shame not to buy them. "We'll  take them all."</p><p>"Auntie?"  the girl's eyes widened. There was a half dozen dresses. "You  don't have to, Auntie. I wouldn't want to impose."</p><p>"And  you are not imposing, Kasumi. I want to buy these dresses for you.  They all look so nice on you it'd be a crime not to buy them."  Nodoka paid the amount with a gold credit card. The saleslady smiled.  If only all her customers were like this one.</p><p>"I  don't know what to say, Auntie. Thank you." Kasumi bowed  deeply.</p><p>"No  need to thank me, Kasumi." She took the shopping bags. "Now  why don't we have some tea before we go back to the dojo, eh?"</p><p>Kasumi  nodded and followed Ranma's mother to a tea shop.</p><p>"Ah,  isn't it a fine day, Kasumi?"</p><p>"Yes  it is, Auntie."</p><p>"Ooohhh,  look at that, Kasumi, aren't they sweet?" Nodoka gestured  towards a couple coddling at another table, hoping to segue into the  topic she was actually interested in. She was gratified to see Kasumi  redden. "Don't you wish you have someone to coddle up with?"</p><p>"Sometimes,  Auntie, but I juist don't have the time and who would be interested  in a boring housewife like myself?" Kasumi looked down.</p><p>"Come  now, Kasumi, you are _not_ a boring housewife. And if men are stupid  enough to see you as such and not as the desirable young woman that  you are then it is their loss not yours." She paused. Let's  see now. I wonder what happens if I say something like... "I'm  sure my son sees you as a desirable young woman." That startled  Kasumi enough to be visible.</p><p>Aha!</p><p>"Do...  do you think so, Auntie?"</p><p>"I  know so, Kasumi, and if he saw you in one of the dresses we just  bought I'm sure you would know also." There, I'm sure I've  tickled her imagination. Oh, this is so much fun!</p><p>"Auntie,  do you think it'd be improper if I brought Ranma some lunch at  school?"</p><p>Yes!  Yes! Yes! "Of course not, Kasumi. Why do you ask?"</p><p>"I...  ah... nothing, Auntie. Just curious."</p><p>"My,  look at the time! Do you want to go home now so you can prepare the  lunch?"</p><p>Kasumi  dragged the older woman home as politely as possible. Nodoka smiled  like the cat that swallowed the canary all the way back to the Tendo  Dojo. She barely had time to pay for their tea.</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>"Ranchan?"</p><p>Ranma  slowly became aware of two hands shaking him. He groggily looked up  in the direction of the voices.</p><p>"Wha?  What happened?"</p><p>"What  else? You fell asleep as usual."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Yeah,  Ranchan. You had us worried a moment there when you pretended to  listen and take down notes. Whew! Everyone thought Ragnarok was  coming."</p><p>Ranma  came awake at that.</p><p>"Oh,  shit! I fell asleep?"</p><p>"Yes,  you dummy! We thought you've lost your mind. You kept pinching and  slapping yourself and then you knocked yourself unconcious when you  punched yourself. What were you trying to do? Good thing you didn't  poke yourself in the eye with your pencil when your head fell on it."</p><p>"Oh."  Ranma now remembered what happened. He had been trying to listen and  stay awake by pinching and slapping himself but it was a losing  battle. In desperation he had punched himself hoping it would wake  him. Stupid idea. It had knocked him out instead. He groaned as he  felt the swelling at his right cheek where he had hit it with his  right hand. Man, I lost this round. This is harder than I  thought. I gotta think of a counter fast...</p><p>"Ranma/Ranchan,  are you alright?"</p><p>Ranma  blinked. "Oh, sure I'm okay. Er, what time is it?" He  looked at the empty classroom. "Where is everybody?"</p><p>"Lunch  time, you dummy! Why do you think we woke you up? Everyone's left  already, they didn't feel like eating here after you made them all  jumpy."</p><p>"Oh.  Um, wanna eat together?"</p><p>Akane  and Ukyo blinked. Ranma's asking them to eat together?</p><p>"Uh,  sure, Ranma/Ranchan."</p><p>"Let's  eat outside. I could use the fresh air."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Ranma  stood and followed the two girls out of the room, down the stairs and  out of the building towards their favorite tree. They had their  lunches opened when Nabiki approached.</p><p>"Hey,  mind if I join you guys for lunch?"</p><p>Ranma  and Ukyo looked up in surprise. Nabiki was usually busy at lunch  conferring with her business associates.  Akane simply shrugged.</p><p>"Sure,  sis. Have a seat."</p><p>Nabiki  waited until Ranma and Ukyo nodded then sat down next to Akane and  opened her own lunch. The girls had barely touched their food by the  time Ranma finished inhaling the lunch his mother prepared.</p><p>"Man,  that was good!"</p><p>Even  before the sentence was out of his mouth two additional lunch boxes  were thrust into his face.</p><p>"Here  Ranma/Ranchan, I made you lunch!"</p><p>Ranma  blinked and sweated, he wasn't in the mood to visit the nurse's  office either for an abused stomach or blunt trauma. He was about to  retort something to that effect when he saw the look on Akane's face  and hesitated. It wasn't the usual demanding look she had when she  wanted him to eat what she had cooked. It was simply... expectant?</p><p>Damn!  Damned if I do, damned if I don't. There's gotta be a less painful  way out of this.</p><p>Akane  noted his hesitation. She was about to yell "Well, aren't you  even going to taste what I worked so hard for, you jerk?" and  pound him for his insensitivity when she remembered what she had  promised herself. She pulled back the lunch she was holding out and  looked down.</p><p>"You...  you don't have to eat what I cooked if you don't want to, Ranma. I...  I understand."</p><p>Ranma  boggled. Ukyo boggled. Nabiki smirked inside. Akane was being nice to  Ranma? She wasn't going to force feed him that stuff she called  food?</p><p>I  ain't gonna get poisoned or pounded?</p><p>He  looked around to see if Ryoga was flying. Nope. He should be estatic  but his conscience bothered him.</p><p>Man,  having a conscience sucks. I know I'm gonna regret this.</p><p>"Hey,  who told ya I don't want your lunch? I'll take them both!"</p><p>The  smile Akane gave him on hearing those word made his heart go ba-bump.</p><p>"You  will?" That easy? I should have done this a long time ago.</p><p>"Uh,  su-sure."</p><p>He  slowly reached out to take both lunches. He noticed the smiles both  girls had.</p><p>They  sure are cute when they're smiling.</p><p>He  saw Nabiki looking at him strangely.</p><p>What's  with her today? He decided to kid around with her.</p><p>"So  Nabiki, got any lunch for me too?" He boggled again as he  detected the slightest tinge of red on the middle Tendo daughter's  cheeks.</p><p>"I  would have made you lunch except the kitchen was no longer there when  Akane finished making hers."</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"Oh,  calm down, sis! It's only a joke!"</p><p>"It  wasn't funny!"</p><p>[Sigh.]</p><p>Ranma  was in the act of opening the lunch Ukyo made for him when he heard  the tell-tale sounds of a bicycle. Sure enough he turned just in time  to see a purple streak hurtling towards him. He barely had time to  get the two lunches out of the way.</p><p>"Ooofff!"</p><p>"Nihao,  Airen! I brought you delicious special ramen for lunch!"  Shampoo said holding the delivery box with one hand while wrapping  her other arm around Ranma who was now down on his back in the middle  of the other girls. Ranma breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the  two lunches he was holding still intact.</p><p>Whew!  Thank God! There'd been hell to pay.</p><p>He  then saw the battle auras around Akane and Ukyo. He had to diffuse  the situation fast.</p><p>"Uh,  Shampoo, can you get offa me for a sec?"</p><p>"Don't  want to." Shampoo nuzzled Ranma's chest sending a tingle down  his spine.</p><p>"But  I can't eat your ramen in this position."</p><p>"Oh."  Shampoo got off and sat down beside Nabiki. Ranma prayed that was  enough.</p><p>"You  hussy!" Akane and Ukyo hissed. They were having a nice lunch  with Ranma and Shampoo had to come and ruin it. Well they're going to  make her pay.</p><p>"Who  are you calling a hussy?"</p><p>Things  would have degenerated into another melee were it not for the new  voice that sent calming waves over them.</p><p>"Ranma-kun!"</p><p>Heads  whipped around to see the oldest Tendo daughter walking towards them.</p><p>"Kasumi!  Sis!"</p><p>Ranma's  eyes bugged. Kasumi was wearing a white sun dress that showed her  slender shoulders while the skirt went down to just below her knee.  The lightness of the material clung to her lush curves whenever the  wind blew. The dress was still modest by most standards but the  effect was startling. Gone was the plain, simple girl-housewife. What  stood there was a young woman in full bloom. The fact was not lost on  the other girls who felt jealous but couldn't work up any animosity  towards the eldest Tendo sister.</p><p>Kasumi?  That can't be sis!</p><p>Where  did sis get that dress? Not my style but I wouldn't have missed  something like that!</p><p>Nice  Tendo girl is now nice Tendo woman!</p><p>Whoa!  What is Kasumi wearing? Gotta buy me one of those. Wonder where she  got it?</p><p>Then  one thought struck four girls at once.</p><p>What  is she doing here wearing something like that?</p><p>"Uh,  um. What brings ya here, Kasumi?" Ranma tried not to roam his  eyes over Kasumi. He succeeded a moment later by looking at the tip  of his nose. Fortunately the other girls didn't notice as they were  also staring at Kasumi.</p><p>Kasumi  blushed, she had seen how Ranma's eyes had widened and then looked  her over before getting cross-eyed. "Oh, I... I thought I'd  bring you some lunch. Auntie said that you might not have enough to  eat." She indicated the lunch box she held in both hands in  front of her.</p><p>Shampoo,  Ukyo even Akane and Nabiki boggled. Sure the two younger sisters knew  what their oldest sister felt towards Ranma and she did bring food to  Dr. Tofu on occasion but for her to be this forward? So soon? And  wearing that dress? Where did she get that dress anyway?</p><p>Ukyo  leaned over to Nabiki and Akane and whispered.</p><p>"Is  there something going on here? Why is Kasumi bringing lunch for Ranma  wearing a dress like that?"</p><p>Shampoo  nodded, she also wanted to know if there was something going on.  Nabiki sighed, she wasn't ready to go public yet with her feelings  but Kasumi just forced her hand. She already noticed the stares and  whispering from the other students.</p><p>Well,  the cat's going to be out of the bag soon. Wonder what made Kasumi do  this?</p><p>"Um,  can we girls talk later? This isn't a good place." Nabiki  cocked her head towards Ranma. She felt he wouldn't be able to handle  the fact that he now had two more girls after him.</p><p>"When  and where?"</p><p>"How  about your place after school. We'll bring Kasumi." Nabiki said  to Ukyo.</p><p>"Sure."  Ukyo and Shampoo let it go at that. They felt uneasy but at least  they'll know later. They returned their attention to Ranma and  Kasumi.</p><p>"Auntie?  Oh, ya mean mom. Where is she?" Ranma kept his eyes crossed. He  felt stupid but he preferred feeling stupid to feeling pain.</p><p>"She's  at the Dojo. She's so nice to let me go out while she took care of   the house." She held out the lunch towards Ranma.</p><p>"Uh,  thanks." I think. Ranma took it and watched as Kasumi  blush even deeper, the white of her dress nicely contrasting with the  red. She sat with the other girls looking at him. His eyes flicked  back and forth between the girls. Their looks made him nervous. He  spread and opened the four lunches in front of him.</p><p>"Ah,  Kasumi?" Akane couldn't stand her curiosity any longer. "Where  did you get that dress? I've never seen you wear it before."</p><p>"Oh,  this?" Kasumi looked down at the new dress. "Auntie took  me to a dress shop this morning and bought me some dresses. Isn't she  so nice?"</p><p>"My  mom bought you dresses?"</p><p>"Why,  yes, Ranma. She said they looked so nice on me it'd be a shame not to  buy them."</p><p>"'Dresses'  as in more than one, sis?" Nabiki wanted to be sure.</p><p>"Why  yes, Nabiki, she bought me six. Do you think I look nice in this,  Ranma?" Kasumi asked shyly. She reddened even more, her  boldness surprising even her.</p><p>Six?  I have got to get on her good side.</p><p>"Um,  yeah, the dress looks nice on ya, Kasumi-chan." The words were  out of his mouth before he knew what he was saying. The smile Kasumi  gave him made him weak in the knees. He saw Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo  scrunch their eyebrows together.</p><p>Why  doesn't he ever say nice things like that to me?</p><p>+++++  Flashback +++++</p><p>"Try  to be more affectionate to the girls but do it equally to each. I'm  sure if you treat them nicely they'll act nicely also. It does  wonders for a girl to know she's appreciated."</p><p>+++++  End Flashback +++++</p><p>I  guess I should say something nice to them too. "Uh, I'm  sure ya all look good in a dress like that."</p><p>The  girls blinked.</p><p>"What  did you say, Ranma? I thought I heard you say something nice to us."  Akane asked.</p><p>"Uh,  I said I'm sure ya all look good in a dress like that." Ranma  nodded towards Kasumi.</p><p>The  girls boggled. They looked up to check if it was raining frogs. Nope.  They whispered among themselves.</p><p>"Uh,  is Ranma sick or something?"</p><p>"Yeah,  he's acting nice all of a sudden."</p><p>"Maybe  it's something he ate."</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"I  wasn't referring to your lunch, sis, which he hasn't eaten yet. No  need to get defensive."</p><p>"I  knew that! And I'm not defensive!"</p><p>Nabiki,  Ukyo and Shampoo rolled their eyes while Kasumi simply smiled.</p><p>"So  Ranma, what did your mom talk to you about?" Nabiki noted his  nervousness and decided changing the subject would relax him. She was  gratified to see the gratitude in his eyes. She began eating her own  lunch.</p><p>"Uh,  it was nothing." He began to inhale the four lunches to take  his mind off his nervousness.</p><p>"Nothing,  huh? Then why did you act the way you did when you came back?"  Ukyo asked between bites.</p><p>"How  did he act, Ukyo?"</p><p>"Well,  he didn't fall asleep right away and he looked like he actually  listened and even took down some notes before he did fall asleep."</p><p>"Hmmm,  that's different alright. So what happened, Ranma?"</p><p>"Nothing.  Mom just didn't like me sleeping in class. She said it was  disrespectful and distracting. I can see where she's coming from. If  I did that to any of the martial arts masters I trained under they  would have beaten me to an inch of my life. She said if that's all I  did in class then might as well go home and do it there."</p><p>"So  why didn't you?"</p><p>"Didn't  I what?"</p><p>"Go  home and sleep? I would have thought you'd be jumping with joy at the  chance."</p><p>"Nah.  I thought about it and I didn't feel like it. Too much like something  my lazy old man would do."</p><p>"Oh."  Five girls chorused. It was a refief for them to know that their  prospective life-mate was consciously trying not to be like his  father.</p><p>"And  that's it?"</p><p>"Well  my mom also said that if I did stay in school I might as well give it  my best shot." He shrugged indifferently. "Don't see much  use for what they teach but mom's got a point. Ain't a good attitude  to have not to give yer best in something, in anything y'know."</p><p>"That's  wonderful, Ranma-kun!" Kasumi gushed, clapping her hands.</p><p>"Thanks,  Kasumi." Ranma frowned. "I guess I lost the first round  though. I gotta think of a way to stay awake."</p><p>"Heh,  that's easy, Ranma. If you fall asleep I'll pound you. That should  make you think twice before sleeping." Akane was sincerely  trying to be helpful. She hefted her mallet.</p><p>"Hey,  not a bad idea. I'll hit you with my spatula too."</p><p>"Urk!"  That was not what Ranma had in mind for a counter. "Uh, thanks  but no thanks." He finished the last bit of food and stared at  the four empty lunch boxes.</p><p>That's  funny. When did I eat Akane's lunch? His eyes widened. I ate  Akane's lunch? He squeezed his eyes shut and waited for the pain  to hit. After a minute of nothing happening he opened one eye to see  all the girls looking at him quizically.</p><p>"What's  wrong, Airen? You look like you're waiting for a punch."</p><p>Ranma  opened both eyes and grinned sheepishly.</p><p>"Hehe.  I did? Hehe. Nevermind. I just remembered something." That's  funny. Why don't I feel any pain? He smacked his right fist into  the palm of his left hand. Of course, the other lunches must have  diluted the poison just like the time they had that cooking contest!  (3)</p><p>"So  what are you going to do so that you don't fall asleep in class,  Ranma?"</p><p>"Well,  I thought I'd tie a rope to the ceiling and put a noose around my  neck. That way when I fall asleep it'll cut my air off and I'll wake  up."</p><p>The  girls blink, blink. It was stupid but it would work. Typical Saotome  male thinking. Stupid but works. They shook their heads.</p><p>"Ranma  why don't you just make it into a challenge? That always works to  motivate you." Nabiki suggested.</p><p>"Yeah,  but how?"</p><p>"Well,  how about this. If any of us girls do better than you in tests then  you have to do what we say for a week and if you get a better score  we do what you say."</p><p>"No  way!"</p><p>"Why?  Scared you can't beat us _weak_ and _stupid_ girls?"</p><p>"Me,  scared? Hah! No way! This is just different that's all."</p><p>"How  is it different? A challenge is a challenge."</p><p>Ranma  knew he was trapped. He could not turn down the challenge without  losing face. He tried to negotiate for better terms.</p><p>"Okay  but only for a day."</p><p>"Four  days."</p><p>"Two."</p><p>"Deal.  Shake on it." Nabiki felt like a million bucks. It was a  win-win situation for her. If Ranma improves on his studies enough to  beat her the better he'll be as a potential husband and business  partner for her. If he doesn't well she'll have an excuse to get  Ranma to take her out on a date. She didn't mind the other girls also  having the same chance. 'Win some, lose some' she always said.</p><p>"Uh,  Nabiki, do you think this is a good idea?" Akane whispered.</p><p>"What's  there to lose? If we win, we get to have him do what we say. If he  improves his grades and wins what do you think he's going to have us  do anyway?" Nabiki smiled confidently.</p><p>Akane  and Ukyo looked dazed. How does Nabiki do that? She'd again  manipulated Ranma like so much dough. Not that they minded it this  time. If Ranma improved on his grades so much the better. If not,  well, they'd think of something to do with him.</p><p>"Um,  can we join too?" Kasumi and Shampoo asked.</p><p>Nabiki  thought for a while. "Sure why not. I'll just have to arrange  something with the teachers to allow you two to take the same tests  we do." Unspoken was the condition they'll owe her.</p><p>Ranma  looked around and saw the smiling faces. On another occassion he  would have found comfort in those smiles but not at the moment  especially Shampoo and Nabiki's. I think I just made a _huge_  mistake here. Thunder rolled in the distance.</p><p>"Great-grandmother,  I'm home!" Shampoo called out as she entered the Nekohanten.</p><p>"Ah, welcome back,  Shampoo. I am glad you are safe." Cologne hopped onto the  counter from the kitchen to see her great-granddaughter.</p><p>"Shampoo!"  Mousse ran out of the kitchen to show his love. He hugged the nearest  plant.</p><p>[Splash!]</p><p>"Quack! Quack!  Quack! Quack!"</p><p>"Hmph! I do not  look like bamboo!" Shampoo was annoyed, her good mood at  spending time with her Airen evaporating. To mistake a thin and  staright bamboo plant for her full curvaceous body, which she was  very proud of, was one of the worst insults anyone could give her.  Another was mistaking a pig for her. Which Mousse has also done. She  dropped a bowl to silence the quacking. "Stupid Mousse!"</p><p>Cologne sighed. Mousse  will never learn. Why can't the idiot understand if he just always  wear his glasses he would save himself a lot of trouble? Stupid  male. She called to Shampoo to stop the girl from storming up to  her bedroom.</p><p>"Shampoo, please  sit. I need to speak with you."</p><p>Shampoo went to seat  herself in front of the Elder. "Yes, great-grandmother?"</p><p>"I spoke with Mrs.  Saotome and she said you wish to enroll at Furinkan. I assume this is  true?"</p><p>"Yes,  great-grandmother. It is true."</p><p>"Why did you not  tell me before?"</p><p>"I... I did not  want to burden you further, great-grandmother and I know you need my  help here and I do not want to leave you alone in this foreign land."</p><p>"What a dear child  you are, Shampoo. Your mother would be proud to see you today. Tell  me, why do you wish to enroll at Furinkan?"</p><p>"I... I thought  that it would allow me to spend more time with Airen and help me get  closer to him. Forgive my selfishness, great-grandmother, I know my  place is by your side."</p><p>"Bah, you need not  concern yourself with an old grouch like myself, Shampoo, I am  perfectly capable of handling myself. Besides nothing would make me  happier than to see you happily married with many children. So this  is what you wish, great-granddaughter?"</p><p>"Y-yes,  great-grandmother."</p><p>"Very well,  tomorrow we shall enroll you at Furinkan."</p><p>"But what about you  great-grandmother? And the restaurant?"</p><p>"There is still the  slacker there." Cologne pointed at the upside-down bowl on the  floor. "And we have Amazon sisters coming."</p><p>"Oh?" That  was news.</p><p>"Yes, I received  the message today. The council has approved a husband hunting  expedition to come here. Eight warriors but no Elder."</p><p>"Oh." That  was no surprise. The shortage of good husbands had been felt when she  was still in the village and it could only have gotten worse. To send  the expedition here with no Elder was also no surprise since an  Elder, no less than the Matriarch herself, was already in the area.  "Did the message say which warriors were coming,  great-grandmother?"</p><p>"Perfume,  Conditioner, Lotion the younger, Powder, Lipstick, Cream, Gel and  Pomade."</p><p>"Oh." They  were of the same age as Shampoo and some of the tribe's best  warriors, almost the equal of Shampoo herself and just as beautiful.  "Do you think they will find enough good fighters for husbands  here, great-grandmother?"</p><p>"Ah, that is where  we have a problem, Shampoo." Cologne replied in a  nervous-sheepish voice.</p><p>Shampoo did not like the  tone of her great-grandmother's voice. "What would the problem  be, great-grandmother?"</p><p>"I may have  conveyed son-in-law's fighting prowess to the council a little too  enthusiastically." Cologne continued vaguely.</p><p>"What do you mean,  great-grandmother."</p><p>"What I mean,  Shampoo, is that the council was impressed enough by son-in-law they  decided to make him an exception to the 'first come, first serve'  rule. The warriors may pursue son-in-law if they find no other  suitable males as husbands. (4) I think the council wants as many of  his offsprings as possible in the tribe. What can I say Shampoo, he  _is_ a great fighter." Cologne weakly finished, sure of the  coming outburst.</p><p>"What?" No,  it can't be! It was bad enough with all the other girls but to have  her own Amazon sisters as competition? It was too much! "No!  No! No! Great-grandmother, you can't let them!"</p><p>"Calm down,  Shampoo. I already sent a message to that effect but you do know the  council can overrule me if enough Elders vote against me."</p><p>"But, but, but..."</p><p>"Shampoo, snap out  of it! All we have to do is make sure they find husbands besides  son-in-law." Cologne tried to reason. "So make sure to  warn son-in-law not to defeat any of them even by accident."</p><p>"Y-yes,  great-grandmother. I'll go wait for Airen at Furinkan."</p><p>"Good, Shampoo. The  warriors should arrive by the end of the week. And while you're at  Furinkan, you might as well get the documents we need to enroll you."</p><p>"Yes,  great-grandmother." Shampoo sped off on her bicycle to warn her  Airen of the coming man hunting women.</p><p>The bell ending the  school day finally rang. For one particular martial artist it didn't  ring a moment too soon. Ranma slumped in his chair as he massaged his  eyes to take the stress out of them. His eyes were blood-red and his  eyelids and eyebrows had been twitching for the last hour from  fatigue as he forced them to stay open for the last three hours.</p><p>I shoulda used the  rope. Man, this is harder than I thought. I wonder if stitching my  eyelids to my forehead would hurt. Hmmm...</p><p>What was worse, he didn't  understand a word his teacher said. He sighed deeply.</p><p>All that effort for  nuthin. Should never have let Nabiki talk me into that challenge.</p><p>He groaned as he thought  of the homework the teacher assigned.</p><p>I guess I should ask  mom for help. Ain't no one else to help me.</p><p>"Hey, Ranchan, you  okay?"</p><p>Ranma opened his eyes to  see the worried faces of Ukyo and Akane.</p><p>"Just a bit tired.  Didn't expect it to be this hard to stay awake."</p><p>"You should be  proud, Ranma, you didn't sleep at all this afternoon. Although I  think the teacher was starting to freak out after an hour of you  looking at him with those bloodshot eyes of yours."</p><p>"Yeah, you really  should take it easy for his sake. He ran out the room as soon as the  bell rang."</p><p>Ranma grunted. If he  didn't feel so tired he would have found it funny. "Nah, he'll  get used to it. I'll have to get used to it." He stood up and  stretched, popping several joints in the process. "What really  bugs me is that I didn't understand a thing he said." He  cricked his neck.</p><p>"Don't worry too  much about it Ranma, you'll get the hang of it sooner or later."</p><p>"Yeah , guess  you're right, Akane." Better sooner. I don't wanna find out  what you guys are gonna make me do. "Let's go home."</p><p>When they stepped out of  the building they saw Nabiki talking with Shampoo. Shampoo ran to  Ranma the instant she saw him.</p><p>[Glomp!]</p><p>"Airen! I have to  warn you!"</p><p>She was pulled off by  Akane and Ukyo. "Will you stop doing that!" It's getting  to be a habit for these two to do a duet.</p><p>Ranma groaned. Not  again.</p><p>Shampoo angrily shrugged  off the hands holding her. "Stop doing what? And stop pulling  me off my Airen!"</p><p>I know I'm gonna  regret this.</p><p>"Rubbing yourself  against _my_ fiance! And he is not your Airen!"</p><p>"Uh, girls?"</p><p>"You two are just  jealous! And he _is_ my Airen!"</p><p>Be assertive! What am  I, a man or a mouse?</p><p>"Is not!"</p><p>"Girls?"</p><p>"Is too!"</p><p>Man, they're ignoring  me.</p><p>"That does it! This  time you're going down, you bimbo!"</p><p>"Girls!"</p><p>"What?" The  combined shout of the three girls blew Ranma off his feet. The three  girls blinked as they realized what they just did.</p><p>"Ranma/Ranchan/Airen!"  They ran to him to make sure he was okay. They began pushing each  other aside.</p><p>Nabiki sighed. "Girls,  remember what you promised Auntie. You said you wouldn't fight over  Ranma anymore. Auntie wouldn't like it if she found out you three  were fighting again." The the three girls stopped pushing.</p><p>That pricked Ranma's  interest. He looked at Nabiki from where his butt was resting on the  ground. "They promised that?" When Nabiki nodded he  jumped up. "Yahoo!" He knew the three couldn't last very  long without going at each other's throats but he at least he could  remind them of their promise every time they got too physical. He  danced a short jig before he faced Shampoo and happily asked:</p><p>"So Shampoo what do  want to warn me about?" His smile and happiness vanished a  minute later.</p><p>"What? You say my  darling Ranma's mother is here?"</p><p>"Y-Yes, mistress I  saw and heard it myself this morning. H-here, I took some pictures."  Sasuke handed over the photographs showing Nodoka from his bowed  position on the floor.</p><p>"Then I must  introduce myself. It is only proper for me to meet my future  mother-in-law. I trust you uncovered her place of residence?"</p><p>"Y-yes, mistress. I  followed her this afternoon to her house." After retrieving his  fallen master Sasuke had come back to Furinkan just in time to see  Nodoka leave after her talk with Ranma. He stuck to her like a leech  until he knew where she lived. He gave a slip of paper to Kodachi  where the address of the Saotome house was written.</p><p>"Very good, Sasuke.  You have outdone yourself today." Kodachi stood. "I must  prepare myself. Ohohohohohohohoho!" With a blizzard of black  rose petals Kodachi went off to her room.</p><p>Sasuke waited until the  last petal fell. He cautiously sniffed the air and when he felt  nothing he raised his eyes slowly. When he saw he was alone he  breathed out and sat back.</p><p>"Well today went  better than expected." Sasuke counted any day that he didn't  get blown up, poisoned, fed to Mr. Turtle or just plain beaten as a  good day. If he was able to eat, drink or sleep he considered it a  great day. Today was one of the latter as he headed to the kitchen to  see if there were any scraps left.</p><p>End Chapter 3</p><p>(1)  According to the All Refer website (link graciously provided by  Philip Jacobs. Thanks, man!) upper or secondary high school, the  level Ranma and Co. I think are in, is no longer compulsory in Japan  so Nodoka can withdraw Ranma from school.</p><p>(2) Did I miss anything?</p><p>(3) TV anime series.  Season 3 episode 45: Ukyo's Skirt! The Great Girly-Girl Gambit.</p><p>(4) This is one thing I  definitely made up to make polygamy in Amazon society compatible with  the 'first come, first serve' rule mentioned in the anime TV eipsode  "Ling-Ling and Lung-Lung. Two Too Violent Girls." If  anyone disagrees with this send me an email with the reason why.</p><p>Well the story's  progressing slowly. Hope nobody's getting impatient for the  action/adventure part. It's just that there are so many little  things that I want to flesh out. Here we are seeing some character  changes due to the influence of Nodoka. Where it leads? Who knows but  here are some appetizers.</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno met Ranma's  mom. Will he develop the same obsession for her (she does resemble  his pig-tailed goddess and they have the sword in common)? Will he  accept that she's his rival's mother? That's she's married? Will he  even accept that she's not interested? Will he make a good stepfather  for Ranma? Ugh! How will Ranma react?</p><p>Can the male students of  Furinkan duplicate Genma's miracle and marry a major babe?</p><p>Ranma gets serious with  his education. Will he start making mechas in their backyard and  build an underground laboratory? That warsuit Gosungkugi is wearing  sure looks nice. Wonder how it works? Will he be able to keep up his  training?</p><p>What will the girls do  with Ranma? We know he'll lose at the start then win in the end (he  won't win all the time). When he does what will he do with them? Cut  his nails? Carry his books? Wash his clothes? Do his homework? Sic  Hiroshi and Daisuke on them for leaving him to his mother's tender  mercies? Ugh!</p><p>Kasumi goes out of her  shell with the help of Nodoka. The other girls are alarmed but just  can't get angry and physical against her. What will they do?</p><p>Who will go shopping with  Nodoka next?</p><p>What will happen at the  meeting between the girls?</p><p>What will Nodoka learn  from her talk with Ranma. Is that a cat she's holding? Ooohhh, what's  she doing starving those big, bad, panda-eating tigers? Where did she  get those tigers anyway?</p><p>What's that other bank  account Nodoka is referring to? Is she a yakuza? Not in this fic.</p><p>Where did Genma and Soun  go? What did they do? Schemed to get Ranma and Akane married while  getting drunk, of course. Now what exactly did they scheme?</p><p>Shampoo is going to  school. How will Furinkan cope with a liberated, ass-kicking Amazon  hottie? Is she the girls' worst nightmare and the boys' wettest  wet-dream? Will the Furinkan girls' uniform survive?</p><p>The Amazons are coming!  The Amazons are coming! What does that mean for the long suffering  residents of Nerima? Will they catch husbands? Will Nerima survive?</p><p>Kodachi knows about  Ranma's mother and is off to see her. Will she hit it off with  Nodoka?</p><p>Where is Dr. Tofu? Is  that an Amazon he's running away from? Is that his mother helping the  Amazon? Did the Amazon pass the hip test?</p><p>Where are Ryoga, Happosai  and Tsubasa?</p><p>For the answers to those  questions stay tuned for the succeeding  chapters of "A Mother's Tale."</p><p>Finally a teaser to those  wondering how this will all end:</p><p>Kodachi will be the key.  Ohohohohohohohoho!</p><p>But that is still in the  far, far off future.</p><p>Philip Jacobs ,</p><p>Thanks for the positive  comments and thank you very much for the links you provided on  information about Japan. Had some nice story ideas from them.</p><p>Nutty AL,</p><p>Don't give me any ideas.  Who knows, Cologne does like Ranma enough to think him worthy of her  only great-granddaughter and is not adverse to marrying him as shown  in the love pill story. (very evil grin followed by maniacal  laughter)</p><p>Joe Fenton,</p><p>Glad you liked the  changes in chapter 1 and thanks for the tip on "Culture Shock:  Japan." I'm still looking for it though. About polygamy in  Arizona and the USA, I researched on the internet and what I found is  that while there is no law against polygamy (except Utah, I think,  because of a condition your Congress set for statehood back in the  1890's) there is also no law recognizing it although there are moves  in your courts to have polygamy recognized.</p><p>dennisud,</p><p>Hey, where's the  challenge if I keep it simple?</p><p>TheCentauress,</p><p>Thanks for the support.  The nice thing about Nodoka is that for a potentially major character  she wasn't really fleshed out in the anime or manga so there's some  leeway in what's IC or OOC for her. Maybe I should make a "Nodoka  Profile" side-story to see people's views.</p><p>To the others who made  reviews, heartfelt thanks to all of you. Keep 'em coming.</p><p>Thankfully I haven't  received any flames yet. If I do they'll be used to light mosquito  coils. Damned bloodsuckers!</p>
