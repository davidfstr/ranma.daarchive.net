</div><p>A  Mother's Tale</p><p>by  Alex Tomas</p><p>This  is my first work of fan fiction. Reviews welcome.</p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>I  do not own the Ranma characters.</p><p>Conventions:</p><p>"  " - Japanese</p><p>{  } - foreign language (Chinese, English)</p><p>[  ] - sound effects</p><p>- thoughts</p><p>#  # - signs</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This  happens during season 7 episode 143, Ranma Meets Mother Boy Meets  Mom, Part I in the television series or volume 22 chapter 2 of the  manga. It takes elements from both the anime and the manga.</p><p>Ranma's  mother, Nodoka Saotome, on her way for the first time to the Tendo  Dojo sees male-type Ranma fall into the storm drain and transform  into girl-type Ranma. Ranma stutters some excuse but Nodoka waves it  off as she is in a hurry and proceeds to the the Tendo Dojo without  giving out each other's names.</p><p>I  am assuming that Nodoka does not know the Tendos and has no knowledge  of the honor contract Genma and Soun entered into to unite their two  familes. My reason is that if Genma informed her then she would know  the Tendos and vice-versa.</p><p>Chapter  1: No Secrets From Mother.</p><p>Nodoka  Saotome was walking alongside a storm drain on her way to the Tendo  Dojo when she suddenly stops as she sees a young man of about sixteen  walking gracefully along the top of the chain-link fence. The boy did  it in an absent-minded way as if the fence was a meter-wide instead  of just barely 5 centimeters. She noted he had black hair tied in a  pig-tail that gently swayed in the wind. She could sense the air of  confidence he exuded and saw he had a physique girls would drool  over.</p><p>Oh,  my. What an impressive young man. He must be a martial arts master to  be able to do that. I'm sure my Ranma is just like him!</p><p>Her  eyes widen in alarm as she sees the sign indicating the section of  the fence the young man was about to step on as being unstable. She  was about to shout a warning when the young man casually flips to  another section. She was so impressed by the feat that she didn't  notice another sign saying the fence section the young man landed on  was also unstable. Nodoka watched in horrified fascination as the  young man frantically wind-milled his arms as he struggled mightily  in a vain attempt to maintain his balance. She was already running as  she heard the splash signifying that the young man lost the battle  against gravity. A loud gasp escaped her lips as she looked down into  the drain where the teen-aged boy fell.</p><p>Ranma  was walking along the top of the fence lining the storm drain doing  something he is not particularly fond of nor known for, deep  thinking. The visit that morning to the grave of the Tendo girls'  mother made him wonder about his own mother.</p><p>So  deep in thought he was he almost fell into the drain when he stepped  on a broken section of the fence. With an quick flip he landed on  another section of the fence.</p><p>Whew,  that was a close one.</p><p>And  promptly falls into the storm drain as the fence he is standing on  also gives way.</p><p>[SPLASH!]</p><p>Our  favorite redhead surfaces with her usual calm demeanor. "Of all  the #!*&amp;%*!" She would have continued venting her  frustration if not for the loud gasp she heard from above. She slowly  looks up to see a beautiful lady in a kimono holding a bundle with a  startled look on her face.</p><p>Oh,  shit! She saw me turn into a girl.</p><p>"Um,  believe it or not I can explain, lady..." Ranma-chan begins. Her  voice seems to snap the lady out of her shock.</p><p>"Weren't  you a young man just now, young lady?" Her voice was calm and  dignified.</p><p>"Um,  yeah, that's what I can explain, you see..."</p><p>"Oh,  where are my manners. Here..." The lady extends the bundle  towards Ranma. "hold onto this and I'll help you up."</p><p>Ranma  looks back and forth from the the lady and the bundle. She shrugs and  grabs the bundle starts to climb out of the storm drain. The lady  begins to pull up but underestimates Ranma's weight and falls into  the drain with Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  panics, wind milling her arms wildly and stammers out apologies to  the lady. The lady stands up alongside her in the drain in knee-deep  water and gently smiles at Ranma. She places a hand on Ranma's head  which promptly calms the younger girl. Ranma gazes up in wonder at  the older woman.</p><p>"My,  what a tomboy you are. A girl should act more like a..." The  lady catches herself "Oh my, I almost forgot you were a boy a  few moments ago. You are a boy, aren't you?"</p><p>"Um,  yes, I'm really a boy. That's what I can explain lady..." Ranma  tries again.</p><p>"I'm  sure you have an interesting story to tell, young lady, but I need to  go somewhere. Maybe the next chance we meet you can tell me all about  it. Good day and take care of yourself." With that the lady  turns away from Ranma, leaving our hero to wonder in amazement.</p><p>"What  a nice lady..." Ranma whispers.</p><p>"I'm  home!" girl-type Ranma calls out as she enters the Tendo home to  the sight and sound of her father's panicked packing. Genma trips and  falls down the stairs landing in a heap at the bottom. Adrenaline  allows Genma to quickly pick himself up and grab Ranma as he runs out  of the house.</p><p>"Ranma!  We're going on a training trip right now!"</p><p>"Wha?  what this all about, pop?" Ranma protests and tries to free  herself but she couldn't get a foothold for leverage and Genma had  her in a death-grip. Genma would have been able to run out if not for  Soun's tripping Genma in time.</p><p>"Now,  now, Genma old pal, what's this all about? Leaving without telling  us? Come on we're almost family here."</p><p>As  Genma falls flat on his face a postcard flies out of his gi and lands  in front of Ranma.</p><p>A  few minutes later finds the Tendos and Saotomes in the living room  with Genma bound to prevent escape. The Tendo sisters are looking at  the postcard Genma dropped.</p><p>"Mr.  Saotome panicked as soon as he saw this postcard." Akane noted.</p><p>"Please,  Mr. Saotome, tell us what the problem is." Kasumi politely asks  Genma.</p><p>"For  the love of god, Soun, please let me go! It's a matter of life and  death!"</p><p>"Calm  down, Genma. Tell us why you have to leave."</p><p>"There's  no time, Soun! She'll be here any minute! Please!" Genma  whimpered. He was bowing and scraping.</p><p>"'Nodoka',  that's a woman's name."</p><p>"Who  is this person, Mr. Saotome?"</p><p>"I  can't tell you even if my life depended on it!"</p><p>Ranma,  who had changed into his male form, came over and gave his father a  kick. He grabbed the front of his father's gi.</p><p>"So  what is it this time, old man? Did you steal, trick or didn't pay? Or  all of the above?"</p><p>"What  do you take me for, Ranma?"</p><p>"Exactly  what I'm saying."</p><p>"To  think my own son would think so lowly of me!"</p><p>"I  know! It must be some old lady coming to collect an old debt!"  Nabiki suggests.</p><p>"Erk!"</p><p>"Or  a grandmother in a house Mr. Saotome burglarized before!" Kasumi  chimes in.</p><p>"Erk!"</p><p>"Or  an old woman who owns a restaurant where Mr. Saotome didn't pay his  bill in." Akane put in her two cents.</p><p>"Erk!"</p><p>"No!  No! No! She's not any of those!" Genma shouts and breaks his  ropes in indignation. He brings out a microphone from nowhere and  starts to yell "She's actually Ranma's... oops!" but  catches himself before he could incriminate himself more.</p><p>Five  pair of eyes go to slits.</p><p>"Well?  What? She's my what?" Ranma was deceptively calm. Genma was  sweating like a pig.</p><p>The  doorbell rang and a new female voice asks "Hello? Is there  anyone home?"</p><p>Genma  goes into panic, flings himself to the floor and tries to hide under  a pillow while shrieking "Please forgive me, darling! Spare my  life! I didn't mean it! My love, have pity on me!"</p><p>"What  did you say, pop?"</p><p>"Urk!"</p><p>"He  called her 'darling' and 'my love'." Nabiki noted.</p><p>"Saotome,  is she who I think she is?"</p><p>"Nerima  All-Night Sushi Delivery Service. I'm here for the dishes." The  new female voice belongs to a homely middle-aged woman.</p><p>"Welcome!  Welcome! So you're Saotome's wife, huh? No wonder we always order  from you!"</p><p>"No!  She's not my wife, Tendo!"</p><p>"Pop."  The voice was deadly calm.</p><p>"Urk!"  This voice was not.</p><p>"So  the person who sent this postcard..."</p><p>"is  Ranma's mother!" Kasumi continued.</p><p>"And  she's coming here!" Nabiki excitedly ends.</p><p>"Sigh."</p><p>And  so a calm before the storm settles on the Tendo household as they  wait for the arrival of Ranma's mother. In the excitement they forget  to ask Genma the reason he was so afraid to see his own wife. He sits  sullenly at the table.</p><p>Patience,  Genma. Wait for the right moment to act.</p><p>Ranma  tries to sort out his emotions as he sits at the porch.</p><p>"You  must be very happy, Ranma." Akane says as she sits besides  Ranma.</p><p>[Sigh.]</p><p>"What's  wrong?"</p><p>"I  don't know what to think, Akane. This is all very sudden." He is  interrupted as the doorbell rings and a new feminine voice calls out.</p><p>"Hello?  Is anyone home?"</p><p>The  Tendos excitedly runs to the door leaving the two Saotomes alone.  Genma smiles.</p><p>"Oh,  this is so exciting!" Kasumi squeals.</p><p>"I  wonder what kind of person she is?" Nabiki seconds.</p><p>"Ranma..."  Genma puts his arm around his son's shoulders.</p><p>"Yeah,  pop?"</p><p>"Forgive  me for what I must do." Genma quickly throws himself and Ranma  into the pond. "But you cannot meet your mother as you are now!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>[Splash!]</p><p>"What  d'ya do that for, you stupid panda?"</p><p>[Bap!]</p><p>#Believe  me, you'll thank me later!#</p><p>Ranma  was about to show his utmost gratitude but decides to follow the  Tendos. He can *thank* the panda later.</p><p>He  saw the Tendos welcoming the nice lady he met earlier.</p><p>"Good  morning, I am Nodoka Saotome."</p><p>Nodoka  sat at the living room table having tea with the Tendos while Ranma  and his father hid in the hallway.</p><p>"I  am sorry to bother you but I am looking for my husband and son.  Recently I heard a rumor that Genma and Ranma Saotome were staying  here. Is there any truth to the rumor?" Nodoka directed her  question to the patriarch.</p><p>"Yes,  the rumors are true. They are staying here."</p><p>Happiness  washed over Nodoka's face making Soun cringe inside for what he was  being asked to do by Genma.</p><p>"Really?  May I see them?"</p><p>"Um,  well..." Soun hesitated, torned inside. He sighed deeply as he  remembered his friend's request. Genma, you better have a good  explanation for this.</p><p>"You  see, Genma and Ranma just left yesterday on a training trip."</p><p>Nodoka  face fell as the happiness was washed away by sadness and weary. The  Tendos hated themselves for lying to the woman, having visited the  resting place of their wife and mother.</p><p>"I...  I see. Can... can you tell me when they'll be back?"</p><p>Outside  behind the Dojo, female Ranma is confronting his panda father.</p><p>"Okay,  pop, spill it! Why are ya so scared of that nice lady? Who is she  anyway?"</p><p>#I  told you, she's your mother!#</p><p>[Bap!]</p><p>"Yeah,  right, try another one. Ain't no way that nice, beautiful and  well-mannered lady would marry a brute like you!"</p><p>#Eh?  And why not? And who you calling a brute?#</p><p>Ranma  blinked. "You're serious? You mean she's really my mother?"</p><p>The  panda nods and pulls out an old photograph showing a younger Genma  with hair with Nodoka holding a five year old Ranma. Ranma takes the  picture and silently looks at it. A determined look comes over her  face.</p><p>Ranma  turns and pours hot water on herself.</p><p>"If  she's really my mother then there's nothing I have to hide from her!"  He turns to enter the house. Genma-panda panics and quickly runs  after his son carrying a pail of water. He catches up to Ranma near  the living room opening to the koi pond.</p><p>"Let  go of me you big jerk!" Ranma shouts loud enough to be heard by  the people in the living room.</p><p>[Bonk!  Splash!]</p><p>Nodoka  pauses in her recounting of the day Ranma and his father left on the  training trip as she hears the shout. Her head jerks in the direction  of the sound.</p><p>That's  a young man's voice! Hope rises in her breast as she hurries to  the place where the sound came from.</p><p>"Perhaps  Ranma came back..." She turns at the door and sees the  red-headed girl she met that morning lying unconscious on the porch  with a giant panda over her holding a sign. Panda with a sign?  She shook her head to clear it of the image.</p><p>"Oh!  It's the boy that turns into a girl I met earlier..." Nodoka  pauses as something clicks in her head. Boy, martial-artist,  pig-tail, right age. Oh, God, no.</p><p>Genma-panda  stops dead in his tracks, turned to slowly cracking stone with eyes  bulging. His unfinished panda sign saying</p><p>#Hello,  strange...#</p><p>Nodoka's  eyes widen and she loses all color from her face.</p><p>"Nodoka-san  are you alright?" Kasumi asks in a worried voice.</p><p>Nodoka  turns terror filled eyes to the Tendos. Only her iron will kept her  going.</p><p>"Is  this girl actually a boy?"</p><p>"You  know, Nodoka-san?" Akane asks with a little worry in her voice.</p><p>"Is  this girl actually a boy?" Nodoka repeated more firmly.</p><p>Genma  was still in too much shock to intervene and the Tendos nod in  unison.</p><p>"Is  he Ranma?"</p><p>Another  simultaneous nod.</p><p>"How?  Why?"</p><p>"Nodoka-san,  you see, it's a curse they got from Jusenkyo. Cold water turns him  into a girl while hot water turns him back."</p><p>"Please  show me." She barely heard the words she said as her world was  slowly crumbling.</p><p>Kasumi  hesitated until she saw her father nod. She got the kettle of hot  water and waited until she saw her father nod again before pouring  the hot water on the unconscious Ranma.</p><p>As  she saw the young girl turn into a young boy, Nodoka's will power  finally gave out and she fainted.</p><p>Nodoka  slowly returned to the world of the living. The first sensation was  that she was lying down. Then she heard some whimpering to the side.</p><p>"Don'twannadieDon'twannadieDon'twannadieDon'twannadie..."</p><p>The  voice sounded vaguely familiar.</p><p>"Ranma,  do something! Your pop's driving me crazy with that whimpering of  his! And why is he going to die anyway?" It was the Nabiki  girl.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>"Pop,  shuddup!"</p><p>[Bonk!]</p><p>"Don'twannadieDon'twannadieDon'twannadieDon'twannadie..."</p><p>Nodoka's  mind began to sort out the sounds she was hearing.</p><p>Ranma  = her son so Ranma's pop = her husband = Genma.</p><p>Ranma  turns into a girl...</p><p>She  suddenly bolted upright as she remebered what caused her to faint in  the first place startling the people in the room. Her eyes flashed as  she looked for the source of the annoying sound. They settled on a  shape lying in a corner of the room she was in that vaguely resembled  an overweight person bound from head to foot with inch thick nylon  rope. Her eyes locked with the eyes of the person thing and  recognition clicked in her mind as she saw the other's eyes widen in  absolute terror. A snarl escaped her lips that caused the blood of  the people within earshot to turn to ice.</p><p>"GENMA  SAOTOME! JUST WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE TO MY SON?"</p><p>The  person thing tried desperately to roll as far away as possible from  the raging woman. Nodoka lunged a little too late as the person thing  smashed a hole in the wall of house and perimeter wall and continued  rolling until it was lost in the distance.</p><p>"OH,  NO YOU DON'T, YOU RAT BASTARD! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WEASEL YOUR WAY  OUT OF THIS ONE! COME BACK HERE, YOU COWARD!"</p><p>Nodoka  looked around feverishly and grabbed her bundle she spotted lying  beside the futon she once occupied. She furiously removed the  covering revealing a finely crafted katana. In one smooth motion she  unsheathed the sword with a metallic sing-song sound, held it  dramatically over her head and in a bellow that would have demons  running in fear declared.</p><p>"GENMA  SAOTOME, I SWEAR WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I"M GOING TO SKIN  YOU ALIVE RIGHT BEFORE I GUT AND LOP YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF!"</p><p>She  then ran off after her wayward husband.</p><p>The  Tendos and Ranma were left gaping and wondering what the heck just  happened.</p><p>"Um,  I guess mom isn't too thrilled about the curse."</p><p>The  Tendos nodded dumbly. They each said a silent prayer for Genma  Saotome and went to sit as they waited for the happily married couple  to return.</p><p>"GENMA  SAOTOME, I SWEAR WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I"M GOING TO SKIN  YOU ALIVE RIGHT BEFORE I GUT AND LOP YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF!"</p><p>In  an okonomiyaki restaurant a few blocks away Ukyo Kounji's head  snapped up from the magazine she was reading as she heard the cry.</p><p>"Now  _that_ is music to my ears. I wonder who the jackass pissed off this  time?" A smile came to her lips. "I just got to meet  whoever this person is. It sounded like it came from the Tendo Dojo."</p><p>She  quickly put on her bandoleer of throwing spatulas and slung her giant  battle spatula over her shoulder. She put up the 'closed' sign on her  door and turned just in time from locking the door to see a rolling  shape fast bearing down on her. In a reflex movement honed by years  of training she had swatted away the threatening object with her  battle spatula in a swing that would have impressed professional  golfers or baseball players before recognition dawned on her.</p><p>Wait  a minute that was...</p><p>She  looked in the direction she had swatted the thing to. She shrugged  nonchalantly, her brief flash of guilt quickly forgotten.</p><p>Oh,  well, it was an accident and its not as if the jerk didn't deserve  it.</p><p>She  shouldered her battle spatula and turned to find herself face to face  with a beautiful woman in her thirties wearing an elegant kimono.</p><p>She  went "Eep!" and jumped back in surprise. It was then she  noticed the unsheathed katana in the right hand of the woman. It  glinted evilly under the morning sun. She put two and two together.</p><p>"Um,  you wouldn't be the person who's going to skin Genma Saotome alive  before gutting and lopping his head off would you? hehe." Ukyo  nervously looked at the katana and at the woman and noticed for the  first time the veins popping on her forehead, both eyebrows  twitching, blood red eyes with narrowed pupils, nostrils flaring,  body shaking and left hand clenching and unclenching. Man, she's  really pissed off.</p><p>"Oh,  my, was I that loud, young lady?" Ukyo nodded dumbly, the woman  looked genuinely embarrassed.</p><p>"I'm  truly sorry if I disturbed you."</p><p>"Ah,  um, it's okay. No harm done."</p><p>"Have  you seen him? I thought I saw him go this way."</p><p>"Ah,  well, you see. He kinda surprised me and before I knew it I swatted  him that way." Ukyo pointed in the general direction she last  saw Genma Saotome flying off to. "Sorry if I interrupted  something." The woman sagged noticeably as her quarry got away.  She turned to the direction Ukyo pointed and shook her fist in the  air.</p><p>"GENMA  SAOTOME, I SWEAR ON ALL MY ANCESTORS' MEMORIES I WILL MAKE YOU  PAY!"</p><p>After  a minute Ukyo saw the woman visibly calm herself. The forehead veins  disappeared, the eyebrows stopped twitching, her eyes whitened and  the pupils dilated, her nostrils returned to their normal shape, her  body stopped shaking and her left hand stopped in the unclenched  position.</p><p>"Oh,  dear I must have made quite a spectacle of myself."</p><p>"It's  quite alright, ma'am. This is Nerima. People are used to seeing this  sort of thing."</p><p>"Oh?  I guess it's alright then."</p><p>"Um,  if you don't mind me asking but why are you after Genma? I've never  seen anyone as angry as you are at him."</p><p>"Ah,  forgive me, but it's a family matter. I'd rather not discuss it."</p><p>"Oh,  it's okay, but do you mind not hurting him too much? I mean, it's not  like I like the jerk. In fact he still owes me for what he did to me  but he's still the father of my fiancee so..." Ukyo stopped as  she noted the sudden intense gaze the woman was looking at her. She  waved her hands in a placating manner. "Uh, I mean if it means  to you that much to hurt him, uh, well, be my guess. He he."  Ukyo sweat dropped as the gaze never wavered. "Uh, what, is  something on my face?"</p><p>"Who  exactly is your fiance?" Nodoka didn't discount the fact that  Genma might have fooled around behind her back.</p><p>"Uh,  Ranma Saotome. Why? Does Genma have another son?" Ukyo was  puzzled as the woman suddenly started jumping around with a smile on  her face. Puzzlement turned to alarm as the woman swept her up in a  bear hug while still jumping around. She felt her teeth rattle around  in her mouth and had her air crushed out of her lungs.</p><p>"AAAAAAHHHHHH!"</p><p>"Oh,  joy! Oh, joy! My son has a fiancee! And such a beautiful one at  that!"</p><p>Ukyo's  head jerked around at the last statement. She tried to get a word out  and almost bit her tongue off as her jaw snapped up and down in  cadence with the woman's jumps. She held on for dear life and waited  until the woman tired. The woman finally stopped when she noticed the  girl turning a little blue-green. Ukyo wobbled around as she  struggled to regain her equilibrium and keep her breakfast in her  stomach while taking great heaving breaths. She failed in both as she  fell painfully on her butt and leaned over the gutter where she  deposited the okonomiyaki she had for breakfast.</p><p>"Uuurrrggghhh!"</p><p>Hmmm.  Thought Nodoka. Girl. Fiance. Morning. Vomiting. A brilliant  smile lit Nodoka's face. My son is so manly!</p><p>"Oh  my! Are you pregnant, dear?"</p><p>Ukyo's  eyes widened and she choked in mid-barf as she heard the question.  How one chokes in the middle of throwing up is anyone's guess. Ukyo  only knew she didn't want to experience it again.</p><p>Ukyo  shook her head violently from side to side giving Nodoka a case of  whiplash.</p><p>"You're  not pregnant?" Nodoka asked with some disappointment. Oh,  well. Maybe soon. "Ah. I don't think you should be shaking  your head that much. It's not natural."</p><p>Ukyo  couldn't agree more as the shaking only worsened her vertigo. She  barfed again.</p><p>"Blearghhhhh!"</p><p>"Oh,  my. Are you alright, dear?"</p><p>Ukyo  raised a hand to signal she would be fine.</p><p>"I'm  so sorry, I don't know what came over me. Here let me help you."</p><p>Ukyo  accepted the hand offered and stood up after she stopped throwing up.</p><p>"Sorry  about this. I guess I ate too much for breakfast." Ukyo smiled  sheepishly. "Uh, Did I hear you right? Your son is my fiancee,  Ranma Saotome? You're Ranma's mother?"</p><p>"Why,  yes, dear, I'm Ranma's mother, Nodoka Saotome." The woman smiled  warmly and bowed slightly.</p><p>"Oh,  I'm pleased to meet you, Mrs. Saotome, I'm Ukyo Kounji." Ukyo  bowed low to the older woman which Nodoka returned. Ukyo looked  around. "Uh, where is Ranchan?"</p><p>"Ranchan?  My, what a cute nickname you have for my son. And please, call me  Auntie Nodoka. Ranma is back at the Tendo Dojo. I left him there when  I had to run after my husband."</p><p>Ukyo  smiled sympathetically. "Believe me, I know what it feels like  to run after them, Mrs... I mean Auntie. And please call me Ucchan,  that's what Ranchan calls me."</p><p>Nodoka  looked at her watch. "Oh, my. I should be getting back to the  Dojo. Won't you accompany me, Ucchan? I would love to know more about  my future daughter-in-law." Ukyo beamed.</p><p>"I'd  be honored to, Auntie. Just give me a few minutes to freshen up in my  shop." Ukyo gestured to the store behind her and invited the  older woman in.</p><p>Nodoka  raised her eyebrows as she followed Ukyo in. "My, I am impressed  but aren't you a bit young to have her own restaurant? What about  school?"</p><p>"Oh,  I only open after school and weekends." Ukyo replied as went  into the bathroom to freshen up.</p><p>"But  doesn't that leave you with little time for anything else? And where  are your parents?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"Ukyo?  Are you alright?" Nodoka inquired with a little worry.</p><p>Ukyo  came out of the bathroom with a sad expression. She tried to smile.</p><p>"I'm...  I'm okay, Auntie. I... I have to work. You see... I... don't have  parents anymore. I'm all alone."</p><p>"Oh,  my! You poor dear! I'm so sorry! What happened?" Nodoka quickly  went to Ukyo and gave her a hug when it seemed the girl would cry.</p><p>"My  mother died giving birth to me and my father died when I was just six  because of heartbreak." Tears began to fall.</p><p>"You  poor, poor dear! It must have been terrible for you!" Nodoka  hugged her tighter. Sobs began. "I'm sorry if my questions were  painful for you."</p><p>"It's  okay, Auntie." Ukyo gently removed the arms around her and wiped  her tears. "I'll be alright. Shall we go?" A small smile.</p><p>My,  what a brave young woman. Ranma's very lucky to have her. "Yes.  Let's go."</p><p>Several  blocks away a familiar purple haired girl was riding her bicycle  along the top of a fence. Shampoo was on her way back to the  Nekohanten after her latest delivery when her danger sense went off.  She immediately stopped.</p><p>[SPLAT!]</p><p>"Eeeeeewwwwww!"  went the battle-hardened Amazon warrior champion as she recognized  the thing splattered in front of her as a human being bound from head  to foot with nylon rope. She was about to go around when she  recognized the white bandana and spectacles on what she guessed to be  the head of the person thing. The face, however, was barely  recognizable being the part that saved the rest of the body from  impacting full force on the concrete.</p><p>Oh,  it Airen's stupid panda father. Wonder what happen?</p><p>Shampoo  kicked the thing several times while she contemplated on what to do.  She brightened as a thought struck her.</p><p>Aiyah!  Airen be happy if Shampoo return stupid panda father! Maybe take  Shampoo out on date!</p><p>With  that happy thought Shampoo effortlessly tied the unconscious form of  Genma Saotome to the back of her bicycle for the drag back to the  Tendo Dojo and the fate of being skinned alive before being gutted  and having his head lopped off by an enraged wife. Shampoo hummed the  whole trip back unmindful of the way the Genma bundle bounced around  behind her.</p><p>Ukyo  and Nodoka were still a couple of blocks away from the Tendo Dojo  when Ukyo heard the familiar kring-kring of a bicycle from behind.  She said a silent plea to the heavens that it not be who she thought  it would be. She turned around and winced when she saw her prayer  unanswered.</p><p>Drat!  Just what I need! And things were just going great with Auntie!</p><p>Nodoka  noticed the sudden distress in the girl beside her and turned to look  at what was causing it. Her eyes widened as she saw another beautiful  girl riding a bicycle at breakneck speed along the top of the railing  beside them. The girl seemed to recognize Ukyo as she suddenly  launched herself and the bicycle from the railing to a perfect  landing in front of them. Her eyebrows began to twitch as she  recognized the bundle being dragged behind the back of the girl's  bicycle.</p><p>"Nihao!  What Spatula girl doing here?"</p><p>"The  name's Ukyo, Shampoo! And what I'm doing here is none of your  business!" Nodoka's ears perked up at the hostility in Ukyo's  voice she would have pursued it further were it not for the matter of  dealing with her husband.</p><p>"Excuse  me, young lady, but you seem to have something that belongs to me."  She indicated the person thing.</p><p>"Who  you? This" Shampoo kicked the thing "Airen's stupid panda  father. Shampoo return to Airen so Airen be happy and take Shapoo out  to date. No belong to you."</p><p>"Oh,  forgive me. I haven't introduced myself. I am Nodoka Saotome and the  thing you called 'Airen's stupid panda father' is my husband."  Nodoka bowed slightly.</p><p>Shampoo  looked back and forth between the thing on her bicycle and the  beautiful woman in front of her. Something made an audible click in  her head and her eyes widened in realization.</p><p>"Aiyah,  if you is stupid panda father's wife then you is Airen's mother!"  Before Nodoka could blink she was captured in an infamous Amazon  glomp. "Urk!"</p><p>"Shampoo  so happy meet Airen's mother. Big, big honor!"</p><p>Nodoka  suffered the glomp in quiet dignity. Quiet because she couldn't  scream because she couldn't breath and in dignity because it was the  only thing she could do. Lucky for her Ukyo noticed the bluish tinge  that was creeping onto her face</p><p>"Uh,  Shampoo, Ranchan won't be happy if you killed his mother by  suffocation. You might want to ease up a little."</p><p>Shampoo  blinked then noticed the blue lips and slightly glazed look in the  older woman's eyes. She "Eep!" and sheepishly released her  grip. She began to stutter apologies.</p><p>"Oh!  Shampoo so, so sorry! Shampoo no mean harm!" She frantically  dusted Nodoka's kimono.</p><p>Thank  God for Ukyo. Bless her heart.</p><p>Nodoka  breathed deeply and composed herself. "Quite alright, young  lady. No permanent harm done. Now why don't you introduce yourself  and explain why you keep calling my husband "Airen's stupid  panda father"."</p><p>"Aiyah!  Shampoo forget manners!" Shampoo bowed formally before Nodoka.</p><p>"I  Shampoo of Nichieju, Chinese Amazon, great-granddaughter of Cologne,  Amazon Matriarch. I call honored elder's husband "Airen's stupid  panda father because he stupid, turn into panda because of Jusenkyo  curse and is father of Shampoo Airen." She paused, then added  quickly thinking the woman might not appreciate her calling her  husband stupid. "Not really mean stupid."</p><p>Nodoka  gave a short laugh "Do not worry yourself about calling my  husband stupid. I understand completely. Forgive me but what does  Airen mean?"</p><p>"Oh,  Airen mean husband in Japanese. I Ranma wife!" Shampoo answered  happily in her bubbly voice.</p><p>Nodoka  blinked and it took several seconds before her mind went back into  gear. She looked back and forth the two beautiful girls.</p><p>"You're  my son's wife? But I thought Ucchan here was his fiancee?" Not  that my son isn't capable of handling two women. Oh, how manly my son  is!</p><p>Ukyo  sighed.</p><p>"It's  a long story, Auntie but would it make it easier for you to believe  if we said it's your husband's fault?"</p><p>A  light bulb flashed inside Nodoka's head.</p><p>"Oh.  That makes sense. Now why don't we all go to the Dojo together and  you two can tell me about yourselves along the way."</p><p>The  two girls smiled brightly at the prospect of scoring points with the  mother of the boy they were chasing and the three beautiful women  resumed their journey to the Tendo Dojo. Genma Saotome remained  oblivious to the world and the impending doom that was waiting for  him.</p><p>The  trip that should have taken less than 10 minutes stretched to more  than thirty as Nodoka avidly listened to the two girl's stories,  asking questions now and then. Several times during the walk Genma  began to stir and groan at which point Nodoka would ask either  Shampoo or Ukyo to knock him out again. The two girls happily  complied with the request using either a bonbori or a spatula.</p><p>As  usual it was Kasumi who answered the door with a smile.</p><p>"Oh,  Mrs. Saotome, you're finally back! We were starting to worry about  you." Nodoka didn't miss the point that they didn't worry about  Genma. Kasumi saw Shampoo and Ukyo behind Ranma's mother and the  bundle behind Shampoo's bicycle. "And you brought Ranma's  friends and Mr. Saotome back with you! How nice."</p><p>"Thank  you, Kasumi. Where are the others? Where is my son?"</p><p>"Oh,  my family is waiting in the living room while Ranma-kun went out a  few minutes after you left to look for you. He should be back any  time soon. We can wait for him there."</p><p>Oh!  How manly my son is to look for his mother!</p><p>Kasumi  led the entourage into the house.</p><p>Mr.  Tendo was immediately on his feet when he saw Nodoka.</p><p>"Mrs.  Saotome! Thank God you're alright!" He stopped suddenly as he  saw the two girls behind Nodoka. He paled when he saw the bundle they  were dragging between them.</p><p>"My  God! What have the two of you done to Genma?" He tried to go to  the bundle that was his friend.</p><p>"Calm  down Mr. Tendo. The girls didn't do anything to my husband that I  didn't ask them to. Besides he's fine, just knocked unconscious."  She turned to the girls. "Shampoo, Ukyo you may put my husband  down in the corner while we wait for my son to return." The two  girls nodded as they dragged and dropped Genma's carcass in the  corner.</p><p>At  the mention of the two names Akane immediately frowned where she sat  in the living room.</p><p>What  are they doing here?</p><p>"Mrs.  Saotome, Shampoo, Ukyo won't you sit down and have some tea?"  Kasumi, ever the perfect hostess, politely asked.</p><p>"Thank  you dear. And please call me Auntie." Nodoka sat with Shampoo  and Ukyo at her side.</p><p>Nabiki  was about to ask how Nodoka met Shampoo and Ukyo when Ranma dropped  into the backyard outside the living room.</p><p>"Hey,  is my mom back yet? I couldn't find her... "</p><p>Ranma  then noticed the additional people in the living room locking on one  particular person. He ran to hug her.</p><p>"Mom!  I'm so glad you're safe!"</p><p>"Now,  now, son you didn't have to worry." It was a soothing voice. "I  had these two nice ladies to protect me and help me bring your father  back." She indicated to her sides where Ranma finally noticed  Ukyo and Shampoo beaming smiles at him. He began to stutter, fear  rising in his throat. Uh, oh. This is not good.</p><p>"Uh,  I... I... see you've already met Ucchan and Shampoo." Ranma  nervously looked around. He sweated bullets as he saw the look on  Akane's face. He began to look for an exit, the Saotome male survival  instinct kicking into overdrive.</p><p>"Oh,  yes and we've had a nice long talk on the way back here." Nodoka  smiled wolfishly. "I'm so proud of you son! Having such a pretty  fiance and Amazon wife! You are so manly! I guess Genma did something  right after all."</p><p>"Urk!"  Ranma turned to stone as all hell broke loose all around him.</p><p>It  took almost thirty minutes to settle things down and another two  hours to summarize the various stories so Nodoka could have a general  idea of the situation. During the time Cologne had arrived and Genma  had been revived. He was now cringing in terror away from his wife.  Nodoka was rubbing her temples as she felt a headache coming.</p><p>"Husband"  it came out as a low growl. "JUST WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU  THINKING TURNING MY SON'S LIFE INTO A LIVING HELL?" The venom  in the words shocked the people listening except for the target of  the outburst who was now trying to roll away again.</p><p>[TWANG!]</p><p>Genma  suddenly stopped rolling, his eyes focusing on the tanto sticking up  from the floor at an angle that was now slightly cutting into his  neck just where his carotid artery was pulsing. He wet his pants. If  he wasn't able to stop his roll...</p><p>[TWANG!]</p><p>A  second tanto was now buried on the other side of his neck also at an  angle such that the two tantos formed an inverted vee trapping his  neck. Now he was really sweating.</p><p>Just  when did Nodoka get so good? And where did she learn "Hidden  Weapons Technique"?</p><p>"I  HAVEN'T FINISHED! NOT ONLY DOES MY SON HAVE A CURSE THAT TURNS HIM  INTO A GIRL YOU PUT HIM IN A SITUATION WHERE HE CAN'T KEEP HIS OR  ANYONE ELSE'S HONOR INTACT! AND I'M WILLING TO BET THAT THAT IS  JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG!"</p><p>"No!  Please! Have mercy! I beg of you!"</p><p>"SHUT  UP! I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE SEPPUKU PLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO  KEEP YOU IN LINE BUT NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOO... YOU HAD TO PROVE ME  WRONG!"</p><p>"Se...  seppuku pledge, Mrs. Saotome?" Soun meekly asked the raging  woman.</p><p>"Oh,  didn't my dear husband tell you reason he didn't want to see me? Why  he and Ranma didn't return home and instead stayed here?" Nodoka  replied sarcastically. "I wouldn't let him take Ranma away from  me for the training journey so in desperation he made a pledge to me  that he and Ranma would commit seppuku if he failed to raise Ranma to  be a man among men." Nodoka brought out the document bearing  Genma's signature and Ranma's handprint and placed it on the table.  "Well, seeing that his</p><p>carelessness  gave Ranma a curse that turns him into a girl when splashed with cold  water I would have demanded he carry out his pledge!"</p><p>Ranma  was the most shocked by the revelation. He stared at the document.</p><p>"Mo-mom..."</p><p>"Don't  worry, Ranma. I never intended for you to carry out the pledge. You  were only five years old then and didn't understand what was going  on. The pledge was to keep your father in line. It seems it wasn't  enough of a threat."</p><p>There  were sighs of relief around the table.</p><p>"Whew,  for a moment there I thought Ranma/Ranchan/Airen had to kill himself  with his stupid father." was the general comment around the  table.</p><p>"Hey!  What about me?" Genma was indignant. All but two shrugged in  reply. Soun was the most sympathetic as he needed Genma the most as a  partner in shogi, drinking and plotting to get Ranma and Akane  married. Kasumi, however, was just too nice to shrug.</p><p>As  tempting as the thought of skinning and gutting before cutting her  husband's fool head off as a release of the tension Nodoka was  feeling she put that aside to deal with more 'pleasant' matters.</p><p>"Husband  do not get any foolish ideas of running away. I will deal with you  later." Cologne cackled. It was time someone put the fat fool in  his place.</p><p>Nodoka  closed her eyes and rubbed her temples.</p><p>"Now  regarding my son's multiple commitments..."</p><p>"Ranma  must marry Akane!" Soun immediately shouted. "Please?  Pretty please?" He added meekly a moment later while batting his  eyelashes as he melted under the gaze Nodoka directed at him. He  oozed behind Kasumi for protection.</p><p>"Wow!  She's good." Nabiki whispered to her sisters who nodded in  agreement, awestruck.</p><p>"Now  as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, at the moment I do  not see any way for my son to be able to satisfy all the commitments  his foolish father imposed on him." A thought came to her head.  "These three _are_ the only arrangements my stupid husband  entered into, correct?" At the group's hesitation Nodoka planted  her forehead in her right hand. "Please don't tell me there are  more?" At the nod. "How many more?"</p><p>"Ah,  mom, we don't know exactly. Pop wouldn't tell us but we do know of at  least two more." Ranma explained Kaori Daikokuji.</p><p>Nodoka  shot up and gave a glare that would have killed a blue whale.</p><p>"YOU  SOLD MY SON FOR A BOWL OF RICE AND TWO STINKING FISHES?"</p><p>"Plus  pickles! Plus pickles!" Wrong answer. Absolutely, totally,  no-mistake-about-it wrong answer.</p><p>"AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!"  It was a cry of utter frustration. In a movement too fast for anyone  to see Nodoka grabbed Shampoo's bonboris from Shampoo's clothes and  lunged at Genma. She then proceeded to pound the living daylights out  of him. Genma just prayed the beating didn't cause him to cut his  neck on the tantos.</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>Shampoo  stared at her clothes in shock. How the heck did she do that?</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>Everyone  was impressed at the skill Nodoka wielded the weapons.</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>"Nice  rhythm." Ukyo said.</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>"Nice  form." Akane commented.</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>"Look  at the way her knee bends just so." Cologne knew when she was in  the presence of a master. "That way she gets most of the power  from her lower body." Ahs were exchanged. "Look at the  wrist action. She can do this the whole day without tiring."</p><p>"W-Whole  day?" Soun squeaked. Cologne nodded delightfully.</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>"Wow,  Ranma, I gotta ask your mom how she does that." The girls  whispered reverently in unison. Ranma paled at the thought of more  girls possessing such pain inflicting capabilities.</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>"Indeed,  child, I am impressed by her skill. If I didn't know better I'd say  she had Amazon blood in her."</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>"Oh  my, shouldn't we stop her? I think she's wasting her efforts since I  don't think Mr. Saotome is feeling anything anymore."</p><p>[WHAM!  WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!]</p><p>Nobody  answered. Nobody was stupid enough to get in the way of an enraged  mother, even Soun. Genma was on his own.</p><p>[CRACK!]</p><p>Nodoka  snapped out her rage as one of the bonboris finally broke. She stared  at the broken weapon in anger then in guilt. Shampoo wanted to cry.  It was her favorite pair! She had many great memories of pounding  Mousse with them!</p><p>"Oh,  dear. Did I do that?" Nodoka looked at the teary-eyed owner.  "Oh, I'm so sorry, Shampoo. I promise I'll replace them. I know  this nice blacksmith who makes all of my family's swords." She  smiled reassuringly at the girl. Shampoo wiped away her tears and  bravely nodded.</p><p>"It  okay, Auntie. Shampoo glad to help. Besides weapon break for good  cause."</p><p>"My,  what a sweet and brave girl you are." Nodoka sat back down, not  sparing a glance at splot that was her husband. The rest knew better  than to risk losing their breakfast by taking a look.</p><p>"To  continue, at the moment I cannot see how my son will be able to  satisfy all the arrangements he is committed to. For now I would have  to give equal standing to all the arrangements until a suitable  solution presents itself."</p><p>"And  if no solution is found?"</p><p>"Then  I see three outcomes. The first is for Ranma to marry all the girls  he is engaged to. Personally this is the solution I am hoping for.  Unfortunately, this is not legal in Japan. Second is for the girls to  willingly release Ranma from the engagement. The problem is that this  is not an option for Ukyo or Shampoo since they already lost honor  and the only way for them to regain their honor is by marrying Ranma  or somebody else." Ukyo and Shampoo shook their heads.</p><p>"What  is the third outcome?"</p><p>Nodoka's  face was grim. "The only solution that I see that will satisfy  every girl's honor would be for my son to commit seppuku. My son's  death will release all the girls from their engagements."</p><p>There  were shocked gasps from the girls. Ranma looked sick.</p><p>"Mom,  you can't be serious!"</p><p>"I  am afraid I am, Ranma. Your father has placed you in an impossible  position." Nodoka sighed and tried to continue in a more  optimistic tone. Ranma found himself seriously reconsidering his  principle of not hitting those who can't hit back. He glared at  Genma's unconscious splot.</p><p>"Fortunately  since my son is still below the legal marrying age with parental  consent (1) we do not have to decide immediately. Who knows, a  happier solution might present itself in the time we have."</p><p>"Right  now my primary concern is to get to know my son again. Ranma, it is  time you went home to our house. You and your father have been  imposing on the Tendos long enough. Please get your belongings."</p><p>There  were mixed reactions to the announcement. Ranma was torn between  staying and leaving the Tendo Dojo. Akane was speechless and looked  lost. Nabiki looked bored as ever. Soun was wailing again. Genma was  still unconscious. Ukyo, Shampoo and Cologne were estatic and were  doing a victory jig.</p><p>"Oh,  it was no problem really, Auntie." Well, Kasumi was polite as  ever.</p><p>"Such  a sweet dear you are Kasumi. But I must insist Ranma and Genma return  home with me. It is simply not proper for the two to stay here and we  much to talk about as a family. Ranma if you please? I'd like to get  home early so I can prepare a nice dinner for you."</p><p>"Oh,  be back in a minute, mom." Ranma replied in an uncertain voice.</p><p>"Ranma,  I know this will be an adjustment to you again after staying here for  some time but please do it for your mother? I'd really want to be a  part of your life again."</p><p>Ranma  nodded slowly. It was the least he could do for his mother.</p><p>"Don't  forget to pack your father's things also."</p><p>"I  won't, mom."</p><p>Nodoka  turned to Mr. Tendo and bowed deeply.</p><p>"I  thank you for the generous hospitality you have extended to my son  and husband all these months. If you would allow me I would like to  reciprocate the gesture someday."</p><p>"Well,  you can have Ranma marry Akane." Soun tried again.</p><p>"As  I have said, that is not possible as Ranma is still below legal age  to marry. But I will remember your generosity when it comes time to  decide." Better to give some hope or I'll never hear the  last of it.</p><p>Nodoka  looked at Akane and felt some sympathy for the girl. She could see  the sadness in the girl's eyes. The eyes were on the verge of tears.</p><p>"Akane,  Ranma moving out doesn't mean you won't see each other again."</p><p>Akane  blinked and tried to sound indifferent.</p><p>"Hmph!  Why should I care where the jerk lives?"</p><p>Nodoka  smiled. A prideful one.</p><p>"Akane,  you do not have to hide your feelings. I can see it your eyes and I  can see it in Ranma's eyes also. You care about each other deeply."  This caused Akane to brighten and Ukyo and Shampoo to protest. Nodoka  held up a hand silencing the protests. "but I can also sense he  cares about Ukyo and Shampoo. You" she looked at the three girls  "and Ranma himself may not know but it is tearing him up inside  to have to make a choice. If he ever chooses just one girl, he will  never be truly</p><p>happy  knowing he caused the other two girls misery."</p><p>Akane,  Ukyo and Shampoo looked at one another then at the floor.</p><p>"I  wish we will be able to find a happy solution to all this but I truly  do not know how. Not yet anyway."</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"May  I request something from the three of you?" The three nodded and  waited expectantly. A request from your prospective mother-in-law is  never to be taken lightly. One might need the leverage later.</p><p>"Try  to get along with each other. I can see you have many similarities  with one another and if you weren't fighting over Ranma I am sure the  three of you would be best of friends."</p><p>Akane,  Ukyo and Shampoo frowned and looked at each other. Then they sighed.  They couldn't very well refuse such a reasonable request from Auntie.</p><p>"We'll  try, Auntie, but we can't promise anything." was the consensus.</p><p>"That's  all I'm asking." Of course, if I have anything to say about  it you three'll be best friends in no time. Nodoka smiled  inwardly as she planned her son's lovelife.</p><p>Nabiki's  forehead scrunched together as she noticed the gleam in Nodoka's  eyes.</p><p>Cologne  simply kept her council and tried not to grin suspecting Nodoka's  plans.</p><p>Things  should get interesting.</p><p>Ranma  came down the steps with the two packs.</p><p>"I'm  ready, mom."</p><p>"Oh,  Auntie, wouldn't you like to stay for lunch?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Oh,  that's very nice of you Kasumi-chan but I wouldn't want to impose."</p><p>"Nonsense!"  Soun declared "It would honor my house if all of you would stay  for lunch." He wasn't above winning some points with the person  obviously in charge of the Saotome family. Nabiki rolled her eyes at  her father's 'generosity'.</p><p>"Ah,  well, I really don't know. There's so many of us it wouldn't be  right..."</p><p>"I  can run back to my restaurant and cook some okonomiyaki to help."</p><p>"And  Shampoo can go back to the Nekohanten to get some ramen."  Cologne wanted to talk more to Nodoka. She could sense an invaluable  ally in her struggle to win Ranma for her great-granddaughter. She  didn't really mind what she suspected Nodoka was planning. Her people  did accept polygamous marriages because of the scarcity of good  males. If only the outside world weren't so hung up on it.</p><p>"Aiyah!  Shampoo happy to cook for Airen family."</p><p>"Then  its settled! We shall all eat here like one big happy family!"  Soun boomed.</p><p>Ukyo  and Shampoo raced back to their restaurants while Nodoka and Cologne  helped the Tendo sisters prepare the house after Nodoka retrieved her  tantos.</p><p>Soun  and Ranma, pity for his father replacing the anger before, gingerly  picked up the mess that Genma presently was.</p><p>"Well,  pops, you really did it this time. Thank your lucky stars I don't hit  those who can't hit back."</p><p>"Yes,  he did. Why don't we get him into the furo. A warm soak should do  wonders for your father."</p><p>Ranma  shrugged as he picked up what would normally be his pop's feet while  Soun lifted what he guessed to be the shoulders. The only part they  could identify was from the neck up. They didn't dare remove the  ropes in fear the whole thing falling apart. The blood stains would  be a bitch to remove from the wood floor. The water would soak  through them anyway.</p><p>They  carefully put Genma in the furo making certain his head stayed above  water. They tied a rope to the faucet and put a noose around the neck  just to be sure. The new sensation woke Genma and he groaned.</p><p>"Hey,  pops, holler when you're ready." Ranma called as he exited the  bath.</p><p>Genma  simply groaned and let the warm water revitalize him. He couldn't  believe he was still alive although the pain he was feeling made him  wish for unconsciousness.</p><p>Since  when could Nodoka hit that hard? Ah, well, nothing a little sake  can't fix.</p><p>He  tried to smile but it hurt too much. Heck even thinking hurt!</p><p>Down  in the living room, Nodoka had banished Soun and Ranma to the porch  while the women went about fixing the house. Nodoka fussed over the  three Tendo daughters like her own children earning a chuckle from  Cologne. Nodoka was appalled to learn that they had to practically  raise themselves when their mother died while their father wallowed  in self-pity. She shook her head and decided to have a talk with Soun  in private.</p><p>Ah,  yes, what all youths fear. The enthusiastic mother. I shudder to  think what will befall Shampoo and Ukyo when Nodoka gets her hands on  them.</p><p>Half  an hour later found them gathered around the somewhat cramped table.  Nodoka had maneuvered that Ranma sat between her and Genma in order  to prevent the girls from fighting over who sat next to her son.  Nodoka finally agreed to untie Genma with a stern warning not to run  away.</p><p>On  the other side of the table sat Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo, Shampoo  having won the right to sit across from Ranma by picking the longest  straw. At the head sat Soun and Kasumi while Nabiki and Cologne sat  at the foot of the table.</p><p>The  food were delicious and the meal was spent in pleasant conversation  with Nodoka asking many questions trying to learn as much as possible  of the people now involved in her family's life. It was then she  learned of a disturbing fact. It seemed only Ranma had a mother still  alive and in the case of Ukyo, no father as well. Her heart went out  to them.</p><p>The  poor dears. I really should get to know them more.</p><p>Nodoka  cleared her throat focusing attention to herself.</p><p>"I  am wondering if you girls would be interested in a little slumber  party at my home, maybe next weekend? I would really love to know  more about each of you."</p><p>"What  'slumber party'? Shampoo not know what 'slumber party' is."</p><p>Nodoka  explained for several seconds.</p><p>"Aiyah!  Shampoo love to go. Is okay great-grandmother?"</p><p>"Yes,  child, you may go."</p><p>"Elder  Cologne it would honor me if you could come as well."</p><p>"Oh,  my. I think I'm a little too old for this sort of thing."  Cologne was secretly thrilled. She tried not to giggle. The sound  might frighten Nodoka.</p><p>"Nonsense  we are only as old as we feel." Butter up! "I really  would like to know more about the people my son associates with."</p><p>"Very  well, Shampoo and I shall attend this little slumber party."</p><p>"Oh,  my, it sounds like fun. I would love to go but who would take care of  the house?"</p><p>"I'm  sure Soun would be fine for a day or so, Kasumi-chan."</p><p>"Quite  right, Mrs. Saotome. Don't you worry, Kasumi. I'll be fine. You go  and enjoy yourself." And keep an eye on Shampoo.</p><p>Well,  I'm not going to eat here if sis is going. Besides I might learn  something useful. "Count me in."</p><p>"How  about you two, Akane and Ukyo?"</p><p>"Well,  I guess if both my sisters are going I guess I could."</p><p>"I  dunno, Mrs. Saotome. I have to work at my restaurant."</p><p>"Nonsense,  Ukyo, how long since you've had a vacation?"</p><p>"Well  I guess I can close my restaurant for a weekend."</p><p>"Then  its settled then. I expect all of you girls to be there bright and  early on Saturday. We have a lot to talk about."</p><p>"Uh,  mom, aren't ya forgetting something or someones?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"What  about pop and me?"</p><p>"Oh,  I'm sure you two will find something to do. You still have your  camping equipment, right?"</p><p>"Uh,  yeah."</p><p>"The  two can stay here while you have your slumber party, Mrs. Saotome."  Soun suggested.</p><p>"Well,  there you are, Ranma. It'll just be for a day or so."</p><p>"Uh,  yeah."</p><p>"And,  son, we will have to do something about the way you speak."</p><p>"Urk!"</p><p>As  the Saotomes prepared to leave after the meal Nodoka noticed the way  Akane and Ranma seemed to avoid each other. Nodoka pulled Akane to  the side. Everyone noticed this.</p><p>"I  know this must be hard for you." Nodoka held up her hand at  Akane's stammering denials. "And I know this is also hard on my  son. Akane, too much of anything is never good and that includes  pride. Is it really that hard to admit your feelings?"</p><p>"I'm  not the only one who has that problem." Akane persisted.</p><p>"I  know my son also has that problem but I will work to rid him of it.  Will you promise me you will at least try to do the same? It will  save the two of you from a lot of trouble in the future."</p><p>Akane  looked into the eyes of the older woman. After a moment she nodded.  "Alright, Auntie, I'll try."</p><p>"Good,  now wait here."</p><p>Akane  watched as Nodoka went to her son and whispered something in his ear.  Ranma seemed to protest at first but a stern look from his mother  stopped whatever he was going to say in his throat. He approached  Akane nervously and tried to avoid looking in her eyes. He was very  conscious of the fact that everyone was looking at them.</p><p>"Um...  hi." Ranma started weakly. Akane simply waited.</p><p>"Uh,  look, ya know I'm ain't good at words..."</p><p>"Ranma,  why aren't you looking at me?"</p><p>"Uhm,  well, ya see..."</p><p>"For  heaven's sake Ranma! Can't you even look at me?"</p><p>Ranma  was about to retort "Wanna fight about it?" when Akane's  next words made the sentence catch in his throat.</p><p>"Please?  Just look at me."</p><p>Ranma  slowly directed his gaze to Akane's eyes. His heart thumped as he saw  those eyes moist.</p><p>"A-Akane...please  don't cry. I didn't mean nothing."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Who  said I was crying, you jerk!"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Uncute,  sexless, tomboy!"</p><p>"You  jerk!" Akane was about to pull her mallet out when Nodoka  appeared between them.</p><p>"My,  you two do have a unique way of expressing your affections for one  another." Ranma and Akane quickly looked in opposite directions.  "Ranma, I am disappointed in you. Go to your father. We will  talk later."</p><p>"But  mom, she..."</p><p>"Go!  Now!" When Ranma left and Nodoka focused on Akane.</p><p>"Akane,  I am sorry if my son aggravates you..."</p><p>"No,  no, Auntie! No need to apologize..."</p><p>"But  I must. I promise you I will work to rid him of some of the bad  habits he learned. Will you keep your promise to me earlier?"</p><p>Akane  sighed. "I will, Auntie, I will."</p><p>One  thing at a time, Nodoka. First her pride then her temper. Or should  that be the other way around? Hmmm... Nodoka thought to herself  as she went back to where Ranma and Genma waited.</p><p>As  the guests walked out from the Tendo compound Cologne noted that  Nodoka was walking deep in thought ahead of everyone. She pogoed  over.</p><p>"A  penny for your thoughts, young one."</p><p>"Wha...?  Oh, forgive me, Elder Cologne. I was thinking of something."</p><p>"You  may have taken upon yourself an impossible task, child."</p><p>Nodoka  laughed a little. "Child. Now that's something I have not been  called in a long time." She paused. "And what task that  might be, Elder?"</p><p>Cologne  looked ahead.</p><p>"The  children are stubborn, headstrong. They will not change their ways  easily. Nor will the fathers."</p><p>Nodoka  sighed. "It seems nothing escapes you, Elder." Silence. "I  know this but I must attempt it." Another pause. "Will you  help me?"</p><p>Cologne  looked at her thoughtfully. "You know I am Shampoo's  great-grandmother." She did not elaborate.</p><p>"I  know, Elder. You also know that unless we do something our children  will never get what they want, including Shampoo."</p><p>"Perhaps."  A pause. "Very well, I accept. I would have liked Shampoo to  have son-in-law all to herself but one must be realistic. Your plan  has the best chance of a happy ending for Shampoo." Cologne  became wistful. "I am not getting any younger, I wish to see  Shampoo happily married with many children before I go join my  ancestors."</p><p>"As  do I for my son. You do know my son will, at best, be reluctant to  return to your village."</p><p>"I  know and my people have allowed Amazon warriors in the past to leave  the village to accompany their husbands as long as they maintain  ties. I will allow Shampoo that."</p><p>"And  what of your plans to have her as the next Matriarch?"</p><p>It  was Cologne's turn to sigh. "As much as I want it, if it is not  her destiny then it will not be. Me and my people must find another  to become Matriarch."</p><p>Nodoka  nodded. It was one thing less for Ranma to have against Shampoo. It  was difficult enough as it is with the cultural differences.</p><p>"You  do know how lucky your son is to have three such girls after him?"</p><p>Nodoka  smiled. "Yes, I know and I am proud of him. He must be doing  something right." She turned wistful. "Although it saddens  me that were it not for my son, the three of them would be best of  friends. They have so much in common even if they do not realize it."</p><p>"Perhaps  if your plan succeeds they will be."</p><p>"I  hope so, Matriarch, I hope so."</p><p>"What  do you think they're talking about Ranchan?" Ukyo whispered and  indicated his mother and Cologne.</p><p>"I  dunno but I don't think I'm gonna like it."</p><p>"Why  Airen so suspicious?"</p><p>"Yeah,  you're probably right, Shampoo. I'm just being too paranoid."</p><p>"Anyway,  so where is this house of yours at, Ranchan?"</p><p>"Beats  me, pops never told me. I'm just following mom."</p><p>"Oh,  well. I guess we'll learn soon enough."</p><p>"Uh  huh."</p><p>Soon  only the Saotomes were left walking as the others went their separate  ways.</p><p>End  Chapter 1.</p><p>Author's  notes, acknowledgements, etc.</p><p>Well,  how did you like my first fanfic? Please be gentle. From here I would  probably follow the various storylines in the anime and manga with my  own twists. I might cross this with other manga/anime series if I see  a good story.</p><p>31  January 2004 Update</p><p>Corrected  some typos and such.</p><p>Thanks  for the positive reviews! Really encouraging. One question: Where do  you reply to the reviews? I'm still feeling my way around  . Anyway, until I find where to reply to reviews I'll  include them here.</p><p>Khim,</p><p>Well  I'm lucky Joe Fenton saved my butt. I originally read the idea of  Japanese males having a minimum age for marriage with parental of  eighteen from Joe Fenton's "Family Feud" fanfic found  here. Thanks Joe. I really need to do more research on these cultural  stuff.</p><p>Joe  Fenton,</p><p>Thanks  for saving my butt there. I also incorporated your idea of Shampoo  dragging Genma back to the Dojo. Hopefully it'll be funnier for  future readers.</p><p>Joe  Fenton and dennisud,</p><p>I  actually typed the fanfic as a text file. I don't know what happened  to my formatting when I uploaded it. I'll try uploading as a HTML  document.</p><p>Kickaha,</p><p>Well,  I am considering having Ranma marry all three girls in a country  where polygamy is allowed. In my home country, the Philippines, I  think Muslims are allowed to have up to four wives. The problem is if  having to be a Muslim is a requirement. Got to read up on it. It was  done in PsyckoSama's "All My to admit it now that I like all the fiancees, even [shudder]  Kodachi, and I don't have the heart to break any of their hearts. I  have some ideas on how to explain the behavior of the Kunos but even  then it'll be an uphill battle for Kodachi to win Ranma or even be  counted as one of Ranma's fiancees. I might even bring back Kaori if  I get a good idea. The incentive there is that I can mould Kaori's  character to whatever I want [evil grin].</p><p>nuclear  death frog,</p><p>I  didn't mention Shampoo's father because he kind of disappeared after  they opened the Nekohanten. I seem to recall I saw him there at the  start then poof. My theory is that he went back to China. I might  bring him back as a foil to Genma and Soun. A bar scene with the four  fathers (Genma, Soun, Shampoo's and the Principal) could be  interesting.</p><p>Ukyo's  dad seemed to be recalled only in flashbacks. His death was never  mentioned so I don't really know if he's still alive or not. I  decided he'd be dead.</p><p>Dogbertcaroll,</p><p>If  you're referring to the scene where Nodoka stepped in before Akane  pounded Ranma with her mallet, Nodoka didn't actually say she blamed  Ranma for the incident. She only said she's disappointed. My reason  is that she expects Ranma to act more mature/civilized. Nodoka isn't  going to let Akane or Ranma or anyone else for that matter to get  away with their abusive/immature behavior. Let's see how the  characters adjust.</p><p>Another  fanfic where I got some ideas from is Donny Cheng's "Ranma and  Shampoo" the slumber party and the fiances potentially being best  friends.</p><p>To  the rest who sent in reviews, many heartfelt thanks. I won't be able  to answer all of them or even try but I'll take them into  consideration.</p><p>That's  it for now and I'll try to work on chapter two although don't hold  your breaths as it took me nearly three weeks to finish chapter one.</p>
