</div>Trials and Curses Chapter 5<br/>This story contains mature subject matter such as rape, abuse and depression. Be forewarned.<p>"Go on in Ami, Ranma's in the living room." Ranma heard her mother saying as she left to go back to work. Ranma was lying on the couch in the living room watching Dragonball on the television. She sat up and moved to one end as Ami walked in and sat down on the other end, Ranma didn't know what to say to her cousin. It had been only a day since what happened in the locker room and surprisingly Nodoka let Ranma stay home from school today.<p>"Ranma, I'm sorry." Ami finally said.<p>"About what?" Ranma asked, feigning innocence.<p>"About Lita." Ami said. It must have been hard on her being stuck in the middle of this, but if she came to try and get Ranma to talk to Lita, there was no way.<p>"What about," Ranma said, trying to find anywhere else in the room to look except her at Ami. Finally she settled at looking at the TV where a spikey, blonde haired man was fighting with some oversized pink man in Arabian looking clothes. "She was right after all, so go ahead and say it, I'm a freak."<p>"That's not true!" Ami protested, "You're not a freak. What happened to you was out of your control, it wasn't your fault and you shouldn't beat yourself up over it."<p>"I'm not even a guy in more." Ranma whispered, "Yesterday in the locker room proved it."<p>Ami shifted uncomfortably on the couch, "What are you saying."<p>"Some of those girls were naked Ami," Ranma said, she was so closed to crying. She seemed to lose control more often lately, just more proof that she wasn't a guy anymore. She could remember what her father used to say, 'Men don't cry, only weak stupid girls cry.' Ranma inhaled a deep breath before continuing, "I didn't have any reactions at all, Ami! Look at me, I'm supposed to be a guy and I have a girl's body! I screwed three men and got pregnant and I can't even stop from crying every ten seconds anymore!" Ranma drew her knees to her chest, wrapping her arms around them and buried her face in her knees. Her shoulders shook from the sobs as she said, "I'm not a g-guy but I'm not a g-girl either, I'm a F-FREAK!"<p>Ami scooted closer to her cousin and put her arm around Ranma, "Listen to me Ranma," Ami demanded, "You are not a freak! You are a wonderful person who had some rough times lately, It would have been better if none of it ever happened but it did. Ranma, listen to me, you have people who care about you, I care about you and I'm not going to sit here and listen to you beat yourself up. Boy or girl, your family and I love you, we all love you."<p>"Th-thank you." Ranma whispered, putting her arms around Ami.<p>"You'll see," Ami said, kissing the top of Ranma's head, "Everything will turn out in the end, just give it time."<p>"Where's R-Ranko?"<p>"She'll be here in a few minutes, she had to take care of something." Ami replied.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranko couldn't believe Lita tried to attack her first thing that morning at school. The fight itself didn't take long but the time in the principal's office seemed to last forever. Ranko only received a warning while Lita was suspended for starting the fight. Lita used to be such a good friend, which made this betrayal even worse. There was no way Ranko was going to chose Lita over Ranma though.<p>"Are you alright?" Ami asked.<p>Ranko looked over at her cousin, embarrassed that she forgot that Ami was walking home with her. They were planning to take Ranma out to eat and try to cheer the girl up. Nodoka wasn't going to be there for dinner since she had to work late so the three girls didn't have to worry about being home to early.<p>"I'm fine," Ranko said, "I was just thinking about Ranma."<p>"I know what you mean," Ami said, "No one should have to go through that. She is pretty brave though. If it were me, I probably would have had an abortion."<p>" Ranma said it wasn't the babies fault that she was raped," Ranko said, "She thinks the baby has a right to have a chance to live. It has to be hard though, every time she thinks of the baby she has to remember what happened."<p>Every time Ranko thought about what those bastards did to Ranma, she wanted to take her anger out on something. Thankfully, she saw a perfect target walking up towards them. "Ami, go on and wait for me at the house," Ranko said, "I have something I have to take care of."<p>"But Ranko..." Ami said before being cut off by Ranko.<p>"Please Ami, go check on Ranma," Ranko said, "This won't take long."<p>After Ami was out of sight, Ranko stepped up to Akane cracking her knuckles, "I was hoping for something to take my anger out on." Ranko smirked, "Guess what, you're it."<p>Akane took a step back shaking her head, "Please, I don't want to fight you Ranma. I just want to apologize for the way I treated you."<p>"That's nice and all, but I'm not Ranma and you're in for a world of hurting for what you did to my sister!" Ranko said, almost laughing at the girl. How stupid did this girl think Ranko was? She wasn't sorry at all, Akane just didn't want her ass kicked again.<p>"Please!" Akane said, tears running down her face, "I'm sorry Ranma, I'm so sorry."<p>Ranko shook her head and stood down, this girl really did seem sorry. "I'm not Ranma, I'm her twin sister, Ranko."<p>"Ranko?" Akane asked, Ranko nodded, "I'm sorry I didn't know. Can I please talk to Ranma, I just want to make up for the way I acted. I was just so mad at our parents and I guess I took it out on him."<p>Ranko sighed, this was just great, she couldn't get her workout beating the crap out of Akane. "All right, but if you hurt Ranma or her baby, I will send you to intensive care."<p>"Baby?" Akane gasped.<p>"Don't tell me you didn't know Ranma was pregnant." Ranko said.<p>"Ranma is a pervert!" Akane snapped, "I can't believe I came all this way twice to apologize to that SLUT!"<p>"Ranma was RAPED!" Ranko snarled, Akane was about ten seconds away from swallowing her teeth.<p>Akane took another step back at the venom dripping from the redhead's words. "I', sorry, I-I didn't know."<p>Ranko's anger deflated at that, of course this girl wouldn't know. According to Ranma, not even their bastard of a father didn't know. "If you promise not to try anything and not to upset her, I guess you can come home with me and talk to her."<p>"Thank you." Akane replied.<p>* * * * *<p>"How COULD you?" Ranma demanded. She couldn't believe it, her own sister trying to push Akane and Ranma together. She was just starting to feel better when Ranko came trotting through the door with that bitch. "You know I'm stuck as a girl permanently! How could you be trying to help pop get us married!"<p>"I AM NOT helping that bastard with anything, Ranma!" Ranko said, "Akane only wants to apologize for the way she treated you."<p>"Ranma," Akane said, "I don't want to get married even when your cures does unlock. I just wanted to apologize for the way I treated you. I was taking my anger on you about this whole situation and I'm sorry." Akane paused for a minute shaking her head, "Permanently? The jerk told us it was temporary!"<p>"He...doesn't know what happened." Ranma said, wanting to run up to her room rather than to tell this bitch anything. Instead of running though, Ranma decided just to get it over with. "I was r-raped! You happy now? I was raped and now I'm pregnant."<p>Ranma looked down at the floor squeezing her eyes shut to try and fight the tears. 'Say it you bitch!' Ranma thought, 'I'm a worthless perverted FREAK!'<p>The insult never came though, instead Ranma felt someone's arms wrap around her. "I'm sorry Ranma," Akane whispered into Ranma's hair, "I'm so, so sorry."<p>Ranma looked up into the blue haired girl's face to see tears forming in her eyes. Was Akane serious? Was she really sorry about what happened? Ranma gently pushed out of the other girl's arms and asked? "Are you really sorry?" Akane nodded yes so Ranma decided to give her a chance. She didn't have many friends except for Ranko's and they really didn't count. "If you are serious, would you like to be friends?" Akane nodded as she grabbed Ranma in another embrace, which the red head returned.<p>"When you two are finished with the mushy stuff, can we go?" Ranko said, a wide smile plastered across her face. "Ami and I are starving."<p>"You can come with us if you like, Akane." Ami said.<p>"Where?" Ranma asked.<p>"Both Mom and Auntie are going to be out until late so we was going to take you out for dinner." Ranko explained, "Then we might go see a movie or something."<p>"I'd like that," Ranma said, her mood brightening considerably at the thought of food and a movie, "Thanks."<p>* * * * *<p>Nodoka couldn't believe her luck, even though she was a little annoyed at having to go out this late. She had to meet somebody who was interested in purchasing the old Talbain mansion. With the commission she made off of this house alone, she would be able to pay for all of Ranma's medical bills.<p>She wanted to quit this job, it was only a part time job she took to supplement her full time job. She couldn't though, they needed the money from it now more than ever with Ranma home. Nodoka was glad to have Ranma back, even if it meant having a daughter instead of a son.<p>Finally reaching the front door, she pulled the key for the gate out of her purse. Within moments she was inside the gate and walking up the drive to the door. Nodoka had to turn on the lights inside the house and look over the paperwork again.<p>When she got in the front door, she turned to turn on the lights but the didn't work. "Damn it!" she swore under her breath, it looked like she was going to have to change the light bulb. She walked down the hallway trying the light there but it wouldn't come on either.<p>"Who's there?" Nodoka asked, she could have sworn she saw something moving in the shadows.<p>"Hello dear." A male voice said from behind her.<p>Nodoka spun around to come face to face with someone she never wanted to see again, except at his funeral so she could spit on his grave. "GENMA!"<p>"You act surprised to see me." Genma laughed. Nodoka could see him playing with something in his hands but couldn't make out what it was.<p>"Bastard! How dare you show your face after what you did to our son!" Nodoka demanded. A loud bang filled the air as a burning pain shot through her chest. He shot her. The bastard shot her! Nodoka slowly slumped to the floor trying to fight the pain and keep from falling unconscious.<p>"Don't worry bitch," Genma laughed as he walked out, "I have very special plans for our children."<p>Nodoka's two conscious thoughts were of killing the bastard and a prayer to keep her children safe from that monster.<p>* * * * *<p>Ami couldn't believe how much Ranma was able to eat, yeah the girl was pregnant but that was ridiculous. 'And here I was thinking Serena could pack it away!'<br/>Ami thought with amusement, at least her cousin seemed to be feeling better.<p>Akane seemed to help Ranma out of her depression from earlier, the two of them seemed to becoming very good friends fast. It was hard to think of Akane as the same girl Ranma described. Then again, how would she act if all of a sudden her mother announced an arranged marriage between her and some girl who was really supposed to be a guy? It was just too weird to contemplate.<p>The four of them was passing through the park on the way to the theater when they spotted all the other scouts, minus Pluto and Neptune, fighting a strange woman that seemed to be made completely out of crystal. A monster!<p>"Ranko!" Ami exclaimed, "Get Ranma and Akane out of here. Now!"<p>"But..." Ranma started, but was interrupted by Ranko grabbing her hand and pulling her along.<p>"Akane, come on!" Ranko shouted over an explosion, "Ami can take care of herself!"<p>"I'm a martial artist, I can help!" Akane said, turning back to the fight. Akane went pale at the sight of all the energy being discharged through the air, seemingly without much effort. She hurried along beside Ranma, "Then again, maybe I'll go with you and help with Ranma."<p>"Good, I'll need the help." Ranko lied, trying not to hurt the girl's pride.<p>"What was that thing?" Akane asked.<p>"I'll explain later." Ranko said, "Ami's mom is a doctor, she usually helps out the scouts if any of them is hurt after a battle. I'd stay myself, but we have to make sure Ranma's okay." Good, it seemed the girl believed that, at least that should cover Ami.<p>* * * * *<p>Lita was pissed, the picnic she made for her friends was destroyed by that crystal bitch! She wanted to apologize to the scouts for everything that has been happening lately with Ranma and Ranko and ask for their help. She knew something was wrong and told them as much, Lita never felt like that before. She was filled with so much anger and hatred for the red heads and anyone else who even looked at her crossly. She wanted to kill them, but Lita wasn't like that. Lita was afraid that she was being controlled by the negaverse or something.<p>Just as the others agreed to help and they and started eating, discussing what might be wrong that thing attacked them. That bitch attacked them and Lita was going to tear the bitch apart barehanded if necessary.<p>After the scouts transformed and started fighting back, Uranus and Saturn showed up to help out. Looks like Michuru was still sick, that weakling BITCH! 'NO! I got to get a hold of myself!' Lita thought with disgust, 'Why am I acting like this?'<p>"Jupiter, look out!" Moon cried. Jupiter looked up in time to barely dodge the crystal shards flying at her from the monster bitch.<p>"How dare YOU!" Jupiter cried out, "JUPITER THUNDER CRASH!" The lightning attack missed the monster but the sheer intensity of the power coursing through Jupiter caused her to flinch in pain.<p>"Are you all right?" Mars asked.<p>"I'm fine!" Jupiter snarled, "But that bitch dies."<p>"The lot of you couldn't hurt me, I'm Droid Crystalis, the commander of my Lady's armies." Crystalis laughed.<p>* * * * *<p>Ebony watched as Lady Eclipse laughed at the pain Sailor Jupiter was in when she threw her attack. It was time to take his revenge on his tormentor while she was intent on watching the battle through the pool in the middle of the darkened chamber. The only light coming from the pool itself so Ebony was unseen as he sneaked up behind Eclipse with his sword drawn. Wordlessly he struck, driving his sword through the bitch that cost him so much.<p>This bitch cost him his beloved Reiko, his freedom, his honor and his happiness. The only reason he helped her was to free his beloved from the bonds of Pluto so they could be together. The bitch was finally dead, the bitch who made his life hell. The bitch that was pulling the sword from her midsection as he stood there and watched. He was so dead.<p>"Did you honestly think you could destroy me so easily?" Eclipse laughed raising her hand towards Ebony. "For your traitorous actions you will die, never seeing your beloved whore again." With that, a wave of darkness washed over Ebony leaving only a few small pieces of his armor lay on the ground.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranko leaned against the street sign trying to catch her breath. They were several blocks away from the battle so should be okay for the moment. Ranko turned around after hearing Akane grunt in pain to find her lying on the ground at some mans feet, a small spot of red forming in her blue hair. The man was rather large and was wearing a dirty white gi, a white bandanna tied around his head and glasses. One word came to mind, 'GENMA!'<p>"What the hell do you think your doing, you bastard!" Ranko snapped, immediately regretting it as Genma backhanded her, knocking her to the ground. Ranko fought down the dizziness that tried to overtake her. Damn, the bastard was a lot stronger than she thought. Maybe some of that fat was actually muscle. She couldn't give up though, Ranma needed her.<p>"Bastard!" Ranma cried, charging at Genma to only be thrown to the ground next to Ranko. Ranko crawled to Ranma and to see if she was okay. Ranma was unconscious, but Ranko didn't know about the baby.<p>"Is that any way to talk to your father, Ranko honey?" Genma asked, laughing.<p>Ranko climbed to her feet, staring down her father. "Bastard! I'll make you pay!" Ranko rushed at Genma as he grabbed her neck, lifting her off the ground with one hand. Ranko clawed at his hands trying to get lose as she gasped for breath.<p>"You know, your mother isn't going to save you, I took care of her." Genma laughed, slamming her down to the ground, knocking the air out of her. He put his foot on her chest pinning her to the ground, grinning lecherously. "I was going to just sell you to a whore house, but I think I'll break you in first."<p>"No." Ranko gasped, tears running down her face, "Please NO!" She realized there was going to be no way to escape him, he was just way to strong.<p>"You know, I enjoyed Ranma's screams while he was having fun screwing those guys." Genma said, "I wonder how loud I can make you scream?"<p>"Get away from her, bastard!" a familiar voice growled as Genma was thrown of her. Ranko painful sat up to see Ryoga standing above her. "If anyone is going to kill Ranma, it's going to be ME!"<p>Genma was wiping the blood of the corner of his mouth as a laugh erupted from him. "And what are you going to do to stop me?" Genma reached into his gi to grab something when Ryoga jumped towards him with another punch knocking Genma to the ground. A small handgun skidded across the ground away from Genma as Ryoga hit him in the back of the head knocking him out.<p>Ranko couldn't believe it, Genma watched as those bastards was raping Ranma and he was planning to do the same to her. How could he do that to his own children? Ranko knew he was a bastard but this was just too horrible to contemplate and would never of believed it if it didn't come straight from his mouth.<p>Wait a minute, what did he do to her mother, that was a gun he had. He couldn't of have, he wouldn't would he. He, did, he had to of. The bastard killed her.<p>"Now Ranma..." Ryoga started to say before being interrupted by Ranko flinging her arms around him, sobbing into his shirt.<p>"He killed my mother and he was going to rape me!" Ranko sobbed, "He watched as they raped Ranma...Oh god, Ranma!"<p>Ranko pushed Ryoga away and hurried over to where Ranma was lying and knelt next to her. "Ranma," Ranko cried, shaking the girls shoulders, "Please Ranma, wake up."<p>"Th-there's two of you?" Ryoga said in disbelief, "You were telling the truth."<p>"Oh god, Akane!" Ranko cried looking over to the other girl. "Please make sure she' all right."<p>Ranko was relieved when Ryoga reluctantly went to check on Akane so she could return her attention back to Ranma. "Come on Ranma, we have to get out of here before that bastard wakes up."<p>She turned around when she heard voices yelling behind her, the Sailor Scouts was coming her way as they fought with that monster. Ranko's heart sank when she seen Genma getting back to his feet. Now what, she couldn't fight him, he was way too strong for her. She had to though, for Ranma's sake. For her mother, for Ranma and for herself, she would fight the bastard and find the strength to win. Ranko climbed to her feet and faced her father again, this time she would not be beaten!<p>Ranko winced when she head a bone chilling scream from where the battle was going on. A large blast of lightning just crashed down from the sky and struck Sailor Jupiter dead on. Usually that wouldn't be bad because that was one of her attacks but the bolt was bigger than any she ever seen before. The scream came from Jupiter, which sent shivers down Ranko's spine. They may have not been getting along lately, but Ranko still cared about her.<p>Genma was so shocked by the lightshow he failed to take notice of Ranko coming at him. She quickly kicked him between the legs bringing Genma to his knees following up immediately with a roundhouse kick to his head.<p>"Bitch!" Genma snarled as he climbed slowly back to his feet, holding his head.<p>Ranko jumped back from him and almost collided with the monster. Ranko barely managed to dodge the shards of crystals the monster threw at her. Genma wasn't so lucky, almost every shard struck his body sending him to the ground in a pool of his own blood. Ranko couldn't say she was sorry though, the bastard deserved it.<p>* * * * *<p>"Jupiter!" Moon cried as a colt of lightning struck her friend. Moon could feel the life slowly fade away from her friend, it wasn't fair. Moon stood motionless as the horror of her friend dying right before her by one of Jupiter's own attacks. Jupiter transformed back into Lita as she slipped away, leaving a charred body behind.<p>Moon then watched with horror as Crystalis struck out at Ranko with a wave of crystal shards, which missed her but struck a large man in a white gi, instantly killing him. She couldn't take it anymore, that thing was going to pay for what it did. Tears falling from Moon's face, she raised her scepter above her head and cried out, "MOON DEVASTATION WAVE!" She didn't know where that came from but the resulting wave of energy completely shattering the monster into dust.<p>Completely drained, Moon fell to the ground unconscious from her exertions.<p>* * * * *<p>Pluto appeared right behind Ranma her staff held before her, it was now or never. The bitch was before her helpless, all Pluto had to do was one attack and it would be all over.<p>"I'm so sorry, old friend." A voice from behind her said. Pluto turned on the stranger to find a copy of her except of red hair and blue eyes. The copy even had a time staff. Pluto recognized the bitch, it was the one who caused crystal Tokyo's devastation.<p>The other Pluto was whispering something that she couldn't understand then a flash of light erupted from the bitch's eyes. A wave of calmness swept over Pluto as she sank to the ground asleep.<p>* * * * *<p>Reiko sighed as she saw her friend hit the ground. She walked over to Ranma and knelt down next to her. "Saturn, come over here." Reiko called, then whispered to the unconscious Ranma, "Hold on mom, everything's gone to be okay."<p>Saturn along with Uranus and Ranko hurried over to where Reiko was with Ranma. "Who the hell are you and what did you do to Pluto?" Uranus demanded.<p>"There's no time for that," Reiko said, fighting the pain that suddenly washed over her, she didn't have much time. "Ranma's going to have a miscarriage if we don't hurry, Saturn, give me your hands."<p>Saturn hesitantly knelt down opposite of Reiko, "What are you going to do?"<p>Reiko took Saturn's hands and held them over Ranma's stomach. "Concentrate on healing the baby and give it a little bit of our life force." Reiko said. 'Good!' Reiko thought as she felt Saturn's power flowing into Ranma. Reiko concentrated, adding strength to Saturn's abilities and poured her own life force into her mother. Reiko was going to be weak for a few days after this but it was better than the alternative.<p>Originally, Saturn died healing the baby but this time Reiko was there to help. It was to bad she couldn't do anything to help out Jupiter but it was already too late. Reiko couldn't travel back in time while Pluto was alive, but with the green haired woman weakened almost to the point of death, it was possible for a short amount of time. Unfortunately, Pluto didn't become weak enough until after Jupiter's final attack which caused the young girl's death.<p>Reiko watched as a bulge grew in her mother's stomach, it was a good thing Ranma was wearing those black stretch pants and loose red Chinese shirt. Reiko drew pushed Saturn's hands away saying, "That's enough."<p>"Wh-what happened?" Ranma asked as she looked up at everyone standing around her.<p>Reiko looked over at Saturn, the girl was going to be okay this time. With their combined powers, they would both be all right. "Get her to the hospital soon, she's going to be going into labor within the hour."<p>"What the hell did you do to my sister?" Ranko asked, she was evidently worried about Ranma.<p>"I don't have time to explain." Reiko said as she picked up Pluto and turned to leave, she still had one other matter to take care of. "She will be all right though."<p>"Where the hell do you think your going with Pluto!" Uranus demanded.<p>"I'm taking her home." Reiko said. She knew Ranko and the others would take good care o Ranma so she didn't have to worry about that. Reiko disappeared into the time gate as Uranus jumped at her.<p>* * * * *<p>Michuru was just leaving the bathroom when she heard noises coming from Setsuna's room. Michuru peaked inside the room to see a woman who looked a lot like Setsuna except for bright red hair and blue eyes. She seemed to be putting Setsuna into bed and forcing her to drink something.<p>"You should be all right in about an hour." The red head was saying as she brushed a lock of hair from Setsuna's eyes. The red head seemed to be crying, "I guess this is the last time I'll see you Auntie, I love you."<p>The red head bent over and kissed Setsuna on the forhead. Auntie? What was the red head talking about?<p>"I have to go now, but before I go back home, I will have revenge on Eclipse for what she did to us. She'll pay for all the pain she caused, both in crystal Tokyo and here. I swear it."<p>Michuru burst into the room to find herself alone with Setsuna's sleeping body.<p>* * * * *<p>Lady Eclipse was standing over her pool watching the replay of how Jupiter killed herself, laughing her ass off. It made Reiko sick. "You are one sick bitch." Reiko said, startling Eclipse.<p>"You!" Eclipse screeched as she turned on Reiko throwing off energy blast after energy blast.<p>Even in her weakened state, Reiko shrugged the blast off with ease. "For turning Ebony against me, for hurting my friends and family and for killing people who I loved," Reiko said, raising the time staff until it was inches away from Eclipse's chest, "You will pay the ultimate price. Prepare to die, BITCH! DEAD SCREAM!"<p>At point blank range, the energy completely incinerated Eclipse with only a momentary cry of pain emanating from the woman's lips as she breathed her last breath.<p>As if what she just did was nothing, Reiko turned into the time gate returning to the future. When she stepped out into the mist filled caverns that housed the time gates, Reiko felt something was off. She scanned the time gates until she seen something she thought she'd never see again. Setsuna was standing off to the side with huge smile across her lips.<p>"Auntie!" sobbed Reiko as she threw her arms around Setsuna, "But how, I held you in my arms when you died." Setsuna grabbed Reiko's hand and teleported them to the top of the palace's roof.<p>"Look around you." Setsuna said, letting go of Reiko.<p>Reiko looked down at the city below in amazement, it was as if the battle with Eclipse before her escape into the past never happened. "But how?"<p>Setsuna smiled at her young apprentice, "I never had an antidote the first time so I never had the strength to help fight off Eclipse." Setsuna explained, "But when you gave me the antidote, I made a full recovery this time instead of Hotaru trying to help me and Ranma both. You saved both Hotaru and me from death."<p>"What about Lita?" Reiko asked, wiping away the tears.<p>"I'm sorry, but there was nothing I could do." Setsuna said.<p>"But..." Reiko started.<p>"No buts, Reiko." Setsuna said, "It was Lita's choice and that's final."<p>Reiko nodded, knowing she wouldn't get any further information out of Setsuna.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranko sat nervously in the waiting room in the hospital. Ranma had already given birth to a healthy, fully developed girl despite being born at least six months early. Apparently Saturn's powers not only healed both Ranma and the baby, but it sped its growth at the same time.<p>Both Ranma and the baby were fine, that wasn't what was bothering Ranko at the moment. Nodoka was brought in earlier with a gunshot wound to the chest and was in critical condition upon arrival. She was waiting now to see if her mother was going to pull through the surgery or not. She couldn't bare the thought of losing her mother again. When Genma said he took care of Nodoka and Ranko seen the gun, she was sure the bastard killed her mother. It was a miracle when Ranko came in with Ranma and Akane she found out Yohko was in surgery trying to save Nodoka.<p>Akane was all right though, the only thing the girl suffered was a mild concussion. Akane's family was on their way from Nerima ward, which was a blessing. At least Akane had family, unlike poor Lita. It wasn't fair what happened to the girl, she was so young and didn't deserve to die like that.<p>Genma however, Ranko didn't give a damn about. As far as she was concerned, the world was a better place without the bastard.<p>Ranko was relieved when she saw her aunt walk in with a smile. "She's going to be fine." Yohko explained, "The bullet passed through without hitting any of the major organs."<p>Reiko looked around at her friends who have fallen asleep in the various chairs, even Ryoga was there. After hearing the whole story from Ranko, the boy insisted on staying to make sure everything was all right with Nodoka and Ranma.<p>"All you alright?" Yohko asked.<p>"Yeah." Ranko sobbed, shaking her head. Yohko sat down next to Ranko and hugged the girl, "Th-thank you, auntie."<p>* * * * *<p>I know I used the English version inner scouts and the Japanese version for the outer scouts.
