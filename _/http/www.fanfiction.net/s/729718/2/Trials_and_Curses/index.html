</div>Trials &amp; Curses Chapter 2<br/>If anyone has a suggestion for a better name, please e-mail me. I know the name kinda sucks.<br/>Warning: This story deals with mature subject matter such as rape. Be forwrned.<p>"Damn pervert." Akane growled, glaring at Ranma who was walking beside her.<p>Ranma sighed; she tried to avoid Akane's hate filled looks. Ranma may have had to go to school with Akane and Nabiki, but she wasn't going to wear one of those humiliating uniforms. Instead, the redhead was wearing her favorite red Chinese shirt and black pants with black slippers. Ranma was determined to wear her favorite clothes as much as possible because in a few more months they probably weren't going to fit.<p>The school was just coming into sight when Akane grabbed Ranma by the arm and pulled her to a stop. "I'm only going to say this once!" Akane snarled, venom dripping from every word, "Don't talk to me at all, we don't know each other. Second, if I even catch you near the girls bathroom or locker room, I will KILL you!"<p>"You don't have to worry about that," Ranma said, yanking her arm free from Akane's grasp. She had enough of Akane's crap piled on top of all the grief Ranma was getting from their parents. Ranma was stuck as a girl, probably for good, and the idiots couldn't get it through their thick heads. How could they demand that Akane and Ranma go ahead with the engagement, an engagement neither of them wanted in the first place?<p>With her mind made up, Ranma turned away from the school. She wasn't waiting until after school to go to Jubaan, she was going now. "I'm leaving," Ranma said, her voice growing hoarse. She didn't ask for any of this and Akane was treating her like some kind of freak. "Screw you, screw the engagement and screw our fathers! I'm outta here! You don't have worry about this FREAK anymore."<p>Dumbfounded, Akane stared at the back of the retreating back of the redheaded girl, realizing just how bad she's been treating Ranma. She never acted so cruel to anyone in her life and for the past to days Akane has been acting like Ranma was some kind of horrendous monster.<p>Akane knew she had a short temper, but she didn't really have any reason to attack Ranma like that. Ranma didn't ask to be dragged to those cursed springs, her father was the one to be blamed for that. Their fathers were the ones demanding the engagement in the name of family honor. In fact, Ranma was fighting the whole engagement idea just as hard as Akane.<p>In that moment, every thing fell into place for Akane. It wasn't Ranma that Akane was so mad at, it was their fathers. Sure, Akane defended her father, but the engagement was stepping over the line. Akane would decide who she was going to marry, not her father!<p>Akane started to run after Ranma as the redhead turned around the corner. "Ranma!" Akane called out, "Wait up!" When Akane turned the corner, she was found herself in a small alley with a deadend and no sign of Ranma.<p>Ranma's stomach growled as the smell of food cooking wafted out from the restaurant she just passed. She swore under her breath as she checked her pockets for any money and came up empty. The train ticket from Nerima to Jubaan cost Ranma all of the money she had left.<p>She looked up at the sign that read U-Chan's and swore again. That name sounded so familiar, but she couldn't remember where she heard it.<p>Giving up on any thoughts of food, Ranma continued walking down the street towards her destination when she realized something. How was she supposed to tell Nodoka about Jusenkyo and convince her that Ranma was her son? And worse of all, how was Ranma supposed to tell her mother about what happened with those bastards right after running from the cursed springs. Ranma didn't tell her father what happened after she recovered from her injuries, he wouldn't have understood.<p>If it wasn't for that village of amazons, Ranma would most likely be dead now, and for a moment she wondered if that would have been so bad. Shaking off that idea, Ranma turned into a park with a lot of cherry blossom trees and found her way to a bench and sat down.<p>She remembered Shampoo fondly, the girl who helped Ranma and became something like a sister. Shampoo trained Ranma in some of the Amazonian martial art techniques during the short stay. Ranma wished she was able to tell Shampoo goodbye but was forced by Genma to flee the village in the middle of the night.<p>"Hey Ranko." A girl with short blue hair and wearing a blue sundress said as she sat down next to Ranma. The girl had obviously confused Ranma for someone else when another girl with red hair that fell loosely down just pass her shoulders showed up. The girl was wearing a red blouse and black skirt. The girl's eyes was blue like Ranma's, and despite a few other differences, the two could have been twins.<p>"Ranko?" the blue hair girl asked, looking back and forth at the two redheads. "How? Who?"<p>"My name's Ranma Saotome." Ranma said after regaining her senses.<p>"That's impossible!" the other redhead snapped.<p>"She must be another Saotome." The blue haired girl said, "My name's Ami Mizuno."<p>"My names Ranko Saotome." Ranko said, shaking her head in confusion as she sat down next to Ami on the end of the bench.<p>This was too weird, not only did the girl look exactly like Ranma, she also had the same name. This was too much of a coincidence, how many Saotomes could live in Jubaan? Was Ranko related to Ranma?<p>"What are your parent's names?" Ami asked.<p>"Genma is my pop's name," Ranma explained, her eyes locked on Ranko who was staring back, "But I don't really remember my mom. Pop said she was dead but Kasumi told me last night that she was still alive. Her name's supposed to be Nodoka."<p>Ranma noticed both girls' faces turn pale at this bit of news. They were both trying to say something when an explosion came from the center of the park. The three of them jumped away from the bench as an energy wave struck it. A large chunk from the resulting debris struck Ranma in the back of the head knocking her unconscious.<p>"Ranma!" Ranko cried out when she seen Ranma knocked to the ground. Ranko hurried to where Ranma was lying on the ground with blood coming from a nasty gash from where she was hit.<p>"Get here out of here!" Ami demanded as she started to call forth her henshin rod. She was standing in front of the two redheads blocking them from a woman with green skin and blue hair. The woman had claws like a birds in place of hands and feet and the little bit of clothing she wore seemed to be made out of white feathers.<p>Ami was about to transform when a ball of fire struck the woman in the back throwing her forward and into the ground. As the woman started to get up, a flash of light struck the woman turning her into dust. Relived that she didn't have to transform, Ami restored her henshin rod back into her subspace pocket.<p>"Are you alright?" asked Sailor Mars, worry evident on her face.<p>"Yeah," Ami replies, looking back towards Ranma and Ranko, "But we have to get Ranma to the hospital."<p>After powering down, the three girls went with Ranko as she carried an unconscious Ranma in her arms. They hurried the few blocks to the hospital where Ami's mother worked.<p>After what seemed like forever, Yohko Mizuno entered the waiting room where Ranko, Ami, Serena and Rei sat waiting for news about Ranma. Yohko took a seat across from the girls who was looking at her expectantly.<p>"Is she going to be alright, auntie?" Ranko asked.<p>"Yes, both of them are going to be fine." Yohko replied, motioning for the girls to listen, "First off, she has a mild concussion which was the worst of the injuries she sustained. She's resting comfortably now. The cut on her head really isn't that bad, it was just the blood that made it look worse that it was."<p>Yohko took a deep breath, thinking how weird this second part was going to sound. "I don't know how, but I am convinced that that girl is your brother Ranko." Yohko noticed Ranko fighting back tears. That bastard Genma was going to pay for what he did to her nephew, "I compared her finger prints with the ones we have on record here from where she was born. Second, I compared the blood samples I took from Ranma and some that Nodoka had donated and the results show 99.9% chance that they are related. I have no doubt to her idenity after all the weird stuff I seen in my life."<p>"So Ranma had a sex change operation?" Rei asked flatly, evidently disgusted with the idea.<p>"No," Yohko says, "No sex-change operation will allow some one to get pregnant. I double checked the test results, and Ranma is two months pregnant at least."<p>"Oh god!" Ranko gasped while Ami passed out. Rei and Serena just sat there in shock. Yohko hurried over to her daughter and checked to make sure she was okay. After a few moments Ami woke up and swore under her breath after realizing it wasn't a dream.<p>"How? What happened to my brother?" Ranko cried. Yohko wrapped her arms around Ranko and cradled the sobbing girl in her arms. Ami put her hand on her cousin's shoulder offering her support.<p>Ranma moaned as she woke up, her head feeling like somebody hit her with a ton of bricks. "What the hell happened?" Ranma asked nobody in particular as she took in her surroundings. She was in a small room with a few chairs and a small table scattered throughout the room. A small bouquet of flowers was setting on the table. She was lying in what appeared to be a bed with rails on the side, a hospital bed, she was in a hospital room.<p>Ranma slowly sat up, fighting the pain in her head and the dizziness. The last thing she could remember was being in a park talking to two girls, which one of them could pass as Ranma's twin.<p>"So how's my patient doing?" a woman asked, the voice came from Ranma's right. She turned to find a woman wearing a white coat and slacks with a stethoscope around her neck. The nametag read Yohko Mizuno, the nametag also pointed out that the woman was a doctor.<p>Ranma laid back down into the bed, looking into the woman's face. She could have sworn Yohko's eyes were glowing for a moment. A warmth and calmness washed over Ranma's body, relaxing as she listened to this woman's sweet voice.<p>"What is your name?" Yohko asked, her voice calm as she asked her questions.<p>"Ranma Saotome." Ranma replied, answering without hesitation.<p>"Are you the son of Genma and Nodoka Saotome?" Yohko asked.<p>"Yes."<p>"Then why are you a girl?"<p>"My father took me to a cursed training ground called Jusenkyo. Each spring has it's own curse to it. If somebody falls into one, they take on the form of whatever drowned there last." Ranma knew she shouldn't be telling a complete stranger this, but couldn't stop herself for some reason.<p>"Who's your baby's father?"<p>"I don't know. After changing, pops and I had an argument so I took off. I still wasn't used to my new body so I couldn't fight off the three men who attacked me. They raped me."<p>"How did you get away?"<p>"Amazons saved me."<p>"Sleep now."<p>Ranma was going to protest but couldn't as she fell into a deep sleep.<p>Yohko leaned back into her chair and rubbed her eyes, fighting off a yawn. She had a lot more questions to ask, but the truth spell she put on her nephew turned niece took a lot out of her. She almost wasn't able to cast that sleep spell.<p>Since her mother was an ex-amazon, Yohko knew everything about Jusenkyo and most of the legends surrounding the Amazon village in China. She also knew that Ranma's curse would stay locked while she was pregnant which caused some serious problems. If a person stayed in their cursed form for a long period of time, there was a chance that they would be locked in their cursed form permanently. Nine months was more than enough time to lock Ranma as a girl for the rest of her life.<p>The next thing she had to do didn't appeal to her. How was she supposed to tell Nodoka, her little sister, what happened?<p>Another question kept nagging at Yohko though, what happened to that worthless piece of crap that kidnapped Ranma in the first place, where was Genma Saotome?<p>Ranko couldn't believe that girl was once her brother. It wasn't that she couldn't believe that there was some kinf of magic to do that, after all, her best friends was the sailor senshi. What she couldn't believe was her brother wass a slut.<p>Her father kidnapped Ranma when they were still only four years old, so she really didn't have many memories of her twin brother. Still, she always believed he grew up to be a 'man amongst men' like her mother wanted. Finding out her brother was pregnant both crushed and disgusted her.<p>She still loved her brother, but Ranko was highly disappointed in him. Or was it her? This may have hurt Ranko, but her mother was going to be destroyed.<p>'It had to be Genma's fault!' kept running through her head. She heard all the nasty stories about her deadbeat father while her mother and aunt talked about him. The two didn't know she was listening, but she was, and each new story enraged Ranko even more.<p>Ranko looked at the untouched food in front of her. She was the only one in the hospital cafeteria, waiting for her mother. Nodoka was called right after the tests were done on Ranma to let her know that her 'son' was here.<p>"Damn you Ranma!" Ranko swore, hitting the table in front of her, "How could you do this to us?" Ranko regretted it as soon as she said it. Ranma was still her brother and she was going to help him through this. He...she may have been a slut, but Ranko wasn't going to let Ranma go through this alone.<p>She was going to make her father pay if she ever meets him. If the bastard never took Ranma away in the first place, this would never of happened."Damn you father!"<p>Nodoka sat across from her sister in Yohko's office in her sky blue kimono with red rose patterns on it. She couldn't believe what her sister just told her. Ranma was a victim of Jusenkyo and was stuck in girl form after being raped by someone who had to of been the Musk. Nodoka's now pregnant son was sleeping after receiving a concussion by another of those damned monsters.<p>Still, Nodoka was relieved to find out her child was alive. Genma would pay for what he did to their son!<p>"No-chan," Yohko asked after Nodoka just sat there quietly for the last several minutes. Like Yohko, Nodoka knew all of the legends about Jusenkyo and knew the implications of Ranma's pregnancy. "Are you going to be alright?"<p>Nodoka just nodded, afraid if she said anything that she would burst into tears. How was poor Ranko going to take this, she always looked up to an image of Ranma being a 'man among men' unlike Genma.<p>Nodoka was startled out of her thoughts when a voice behind her said, "Mom."<p>Nodoka hurried over to embrace her daughter who looked like she's been crying for hours, something Nodoka wanted to do herself but couldn't afford. Nodoka had to be strong for her children's sake.<p>After deciding she wasn't going to eat anything, Ranko left her food sit on the table and made her way to her aunt's office on the next floor up. She stopped outside the door when she heard the voices of Nodoka and Yohko. Ranko heard everything from Jusenkyo to being raped by someone called the musk.<p>Ranko felt ashamed about her earlier thoughts about Ranma being a slut. Ranma was raped, something much worse than that jerk did to Ranko.<p>Ranko remembered that time she went with her mother to the Tendo Dojo looking for any clues to Genma or Ranma's whereabouts. Ranko was walking through Nerima when this idiot boy dressed in samurai clothes and carrying a bokken came from behind. He threw his arms around Ranko, one of his hands on her breast. He started calling her pig-tailed goddess and quoting Shakespeare. After getting over the shock of being groped by that pervert, Ranko beat the crap out of him.<p>She realized, as disgusting as it was, that being groped by that pervert paled in comparison to what happened to her brother. Ranko pushed the door open the rest of the way and walked into the room. As soon as Ranko said, "Mom." She was in her mother's arms. Ranko swore if she ever meet up with whoever these musk people were, she'd use her katana to make them women.<p>Disclaimers:<p>Ranma 1/2 and characters belong Rumiko Takahashi.<br/>Sailor Moon and characters belong to Naoko Takeuchi.<br/>I am not writing these stories in any way for profit.
