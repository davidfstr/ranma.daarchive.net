</div>Trials &amp; Curses Chapter 3<br/>This story deals with mature subject matter such as rape, abuse and depression. Be forewarned.<p>Ranko sighed as she walked back towards home, carrying the shopping bags from the various clothes stores in the mall. Shopping usually helped calm her nerves, though she usually went with Mina, Lita or Serena. Shopping just didn't seem as fun by herself and the others were at a sailor scout meeting which Ranko learned a long time ago to avoid, the headaches was just too much of a price. Serena and Rei's arguments were occasionally amusing though.<p>It was a week since Ranma came home and Ranko was happy to have her brother back, or was that sister. She still had a little trouble getting used to that, Ranma was a girl now and probably always will be one. Her mother and aunt explained Jusenkyo in more detail, how the curses worked and why Ranma's curse was locked because of the pregnancy. Worse, if Ranma stayed in the cursed form for too long then she would remain a female until she died. Ranma already passed the time limit effectively making Ranma a permanent girl.<p>Ami checked her mercury computer and surprisingly enough came up with the exact same things about Jusenkyo that Nodoka and Yohko said. There was no hope to change Ranma back and it seemed she accepted it already. It hurt to know that Ranko lost her brother but she was happy to have her sister.<p>"Prepare to die, SAOTOME," a male voice shouted from above her, leaving Ranko little time to react to the incoming bamboo umbrella. Hastily, Ranko sidestepped the umbrella only to be caught off guard by a fist to her face knocking back onto the ground. Ranko shakily climbed to her feet, trying to ignore the pain in her cheek.<p>"Who are you?" Ranko hissed, studying her opponent. He seemed to be about the same age as her and wore black pants tied at the bottom and a faded yellow tunic. A yellow bandanna with black spots was wrapped around his head of black hair. If it wasn't for the guy attacking her, she would of thought he was kind of handsome.<p>"You made my life hell, RANMA!" the man snapped, "And now you mock me! I'll make you pay for what you did to me!"<p>Barely dodging the thrusts from the umbrella, Ranko said, "I'm not Ranma!"<p>"Don't play games with me Ranma," the guy growled, "I'll make you regret ever hearing the name of Ryoga Habiki!"<p>"I don't know what kind of problems you have with my bro...sister," Ranko said, "But you'll have to go through me if you plan to hurt her!"<p>Ryoga stopped his attack in stunned silence leaving the perfect opening for Ranko to strike, she kicked him hard in the chest sending him backwards. After Ryoga righted himself, he readied himself for another attack, which he never got the chance to perform.<p>A small car drove by splashing water from a puddle onto Ryoga causing him to disappear leaving only his clothes in a pile on the ground. Slowly, Ranko nudged the pile of clothing with her foot causing something to stir in them. A small black piglet crawled out of the clothes and stared defiantly up at Ranko. Ranko dodged the pig's attack and kicked the pig into the stratosphere.<br/>Shaking her head in confusion, Ranko gathered up the bags she dropped when Ryoga attacked and hurried home to see if she could find out more about this Ryoga guy.<p>* * * * *<p>Nodoka was apparently still at work when Ranko got home so she put her new clothes away and made her way to her sister's room. She froze outside Ranma's door when Ranko hear strange noises coming from the room. Slowly, Ranko opened the door to find Ranma sitting cross-legged on the bed with her back leaning against the wall. In one hand, Ranma held a sharp kitchen knife with a little red streaked across the blade. Ranko realized Ranma was crying. Ranko gasped as she realized what the red on the knife was, Ranma slit her wrist!<p>Ranko stormed across the room, snatched the knife from Ranma's grip and threw it across the room all in one motion. "What the hell do you think you were doing?"<br/>Ranko demanded after inspecting the red line on Ranma's left wrist. The cut was superficial and already stopped bleeding.<p>"What," Ranma sobbed, "Do YOU care!"<p>Taken aback at that, Ranko sat down on the bed next to Ranma. What the hell was going through Ranma's mind? Of course Ranko cared! She wasn't about to sit there and let Ranma kill herself. "I love you." Ranko said, "You're my sister."<p>"None of you give a DAMN!" Ranko half sobbed, half hissed, "You and mom was my last chance. If it wasn't for this baby, I would of finished it. I would be dead right now!"<p>"Don't say things like that," Ranko pleaded, fighting her own tears, "We both love you, your family."<p>"Does family wrap you in fish sausage and throw you in a pit of c-c-ca..." Ranma dissolved into uncontrollable sobs, unable to finish what she was saying.<br/>Ranko gently wrapped her sister into an embrace, letting Ranma cry into her shoulder. Ranko rocked her sister, caressing the girl's hair, which was out of the usual pigtail. "Ranma, I love you, you're my sister." Ranko cried, "Please, please believe me."<p>"Wh-why do you avoid m-me like the plague th-then?" Ranma asked, her voice and subs muffled by the red fabric of Ranko's blouse.<p>"Oh Ranma," Ranko sniffed, "I didn't mean to. I just have a lot of responsibilities at the shrine helping Rei and her grand father. I... I promise I'll spend some more time with you from now on, but you have to promise that you won't try to kill yourself again."<p>"I promise." Ranma whispered as she fell asleep in Ranko's arms. Ranko held Ranma close, afraid to move because it might wake the girl up.<p>What happened to Ranma, it seemed she was perfectly fine over the last week until now. Apparently though, Ranma was far from fine. "What did that bastard do to you?" Ranko whispered into Ranma's hair. 'What was that about fish sausage?' kept running through Ranko's mind. Nodoka was definitely not going to like this though.<p>Ranko's thoughts drifted back to that Ryoga boy, she forgot all about him during the last few minutes. He turned into a pig when that puddle splashed him, but how. The answer shifted in Ranko's arms as Ranma shifted her weight. Ranma was cursed at Jusenkyo to become a girl so why couldn't Ryoga be cursed to become a pig. Genma! Was Genma cursed to become something too? If he was, Ranko hoped it was something like a cockroach. Then all Ranko had to do was splash the bastard with cold water then stomp the life out of him under her shoe.<p>* * * * *<p>Sailor Pluto stood horrified in front of the gates of time. A large portion of Crystal Tokyo was all but destroyed, a lot of people injured or killed. She had trouble actually seeing what happened because the gate seemed to be blocking her from seeing. All clues seemed to point the blame at a single person though, it seemed a red haired girl was to blame.<p>Pluto followed the stream backwards, tracing where the girl came from. The girl seemed to be the daughter of a red headed woman named Ranma Saotome. After a little more investigation, Pluto learned that Ranma was Ranko's twin. Despite the friendship Pluto had with the fiery girl, there was only one solution to the danger that threatened Crystal Tokyo.<p>Ranma had to die before giving birth to this threat.<p>* * * * *<p>Where was Ranma? That boy was the key to an easy life that Genma looked forward to after the schools were united. If only that little bitch kept her mouth shut and her temper under control, Genma would still have his meal ticket. Ranma ran away though and that meant Genma had to find his worthless son.<p>Genma really didn't care much for his son other than the usefulness in providing an easy life to the bold martial artist. When Genma found out that his wife was planning to get a divorce after the twins was born, he took his son and fled on what he called a training trip. He had to dodge the authorities hot on their trail that was trying to retrieve the boy, and there was no way Genma was going to let his plans fall through.<p>All he had to do was avoid the police until the boy was old enough to make a decision on whom to stay with, and Genma was determined to make sure the brat chose to stay with him.<p>It was to easy convincing that idiot Tendon to go along with the planed engagement after Genma demonstrated his own curse. It was simple to manipulate the fool into engaging one of his daughters to Ranma.<p>Genma wasn't an idiot, he knew Ranma was pregnant. After all, he watched the whole incident with the strange men and was tempted to join them. Ranma had a nice female body and it was a long time since he had any type of that fun. The only thing holding him back was the plan he came up with rather quickly.<p>First, Genma would let the men have their fun with Ranma. After night fell, all he had to do was sneak into the camp and rescue his son who would be so thankful, the fool would do anything for his father without question. All Genma would have to do was get them back to the Tendo dojo and the engagement would go through without a hitch.<p>Unfortunately, a hitch as in a purple haired Amazon appeared. The bitch rescued Ranma before Genma had a chance and took the redhead back to a village full of warrior woman. Genma had a very difficult time convincing Ranma to leave, but finally succeeded.<p>He went along with the obvious lies about a curse sometimes locked when somebody was injured pretty badly, so Genma promised not to make the boy spar until the curse unlocked itself.<p>All Genma had to do was get rid of the baby and Ranma would be able to change into a boy. That was the easy part, Genma was looking for the perfect opportunity to stage an accident that would cause a miscarriage and make sure the boy didn't suspect Genma's involvement in the whole affair. After the miscarriage, Ranma could turn back into a boy and marry Akane, securing Genma's future.<p>The only problem was that Tendo bitch drove the boy away, and now Genma had to find him to make sure of an easy future of leaching off of his son.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranma was surprised when she woke up in Ranko's arms, part of her was ecstatic at the closeness. Maybe Ranma was wrong al along. Maybe Ranko really did care. After all, Ranko did stay with Ranma's breakdown to comfort her.<p>After making sure everything was alright and takeing the knife off the floor, Ranko kissed Ranma on the forhead as she excused herself to go help make dinner. After a few minutes Ranma realized she must have been have been asleep for at least an hour.<p>After a quick stop at the bathroom to redo her pigtail, wash the tears off of her face and the dried blood off her arm, Ranma made her way down to the kitchen. She stopped by the door listening to the voices that floated out of the room.<p>" She's seriously messed up mom." Ranko said, her voice sounded like she wanted to cry.<p>"What do you mean dear?" Nodoka asked, clearly puzzled.<p>"She was trying to kill herself!" Ranko cried, not able to hold back the tears any longer. "She doesn't think we care about her."<p>Nodoka gasped, "What did she do?"<p>"She was trying to slit her wrist," Ranko sniffed, "She said the only reason she wasn't dead was because of the baby."<p>"Oh god." Nodoka cried, "Do you think Ranma will kill herself."<p>"Not until the baby's born. *sniff* I don't think she wants to hurt the baby. I don't know about after the baby's born though."<p>"Good."<p>"WHAT?"<p>"If Ranma doesn't kill herself until the baby is born, then we have plenty of time."<p>"For what?"<p>"To prove that we love her and to convince her not to want to die. I will not lose my child a second time!"<p>Ranma couldn't believe the conversation that was going on in the kitchen. It sounded like she actually did have family that cared about her, maybe it was worth giving another chance.<p>"Have you found HIM yet?" Ranko asked.<p>"No," Nodoka replied, "Ranma won't tell me where she was at before coming here or where that bastard is."<p>"Mom," Ranko said hesitantly, "I think he did a lot more to Ranma than we thought."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"She was saying something about being wrapped in fish sausage and threw into a pit with something."<p>"Cats?"<p>A chill went through Ranma's spine at the mention of that monstorous animal.<p>"I think so." Ranko said.<p>"The neko-ken," Nodoka sobbed, "I'll cut that bastard's head off!"<p>"Mom...MOM! Are you all right."<p>After a few moments, Nodoka's voice answered, "Y-Yeah. Honey, what that monster did to Ranma is horrible and she's lucky to still be sane. I'm not sure if the bastard succeded, but you have to keep any cats away from your sister."<p>"What are you talking about." Ranko asked.<p>"Please don't ask until I'm sure about it, but if Ranma starts meowing, run."<p>"Why?"<p>"Just do it, Ranma will be alright after a little while. But until I know, I don't want to scare you."<p>"Mom!"<p>"Please trust me honey, don't press me on this."<p>Nodoka knew what the neko-ken was, but how. The only other people who knew about it besides Genma was the Amazons. It was a technique that was supposed to be banned centuries ago because of the unstability of the technique.<p>Ranma sighed and went back to her room to think about everything she just heard until it was time for dinner. It was time to decide on what she was going to do in the near future, and for the first time it didn't seem so bleak.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranma 1/2 and characters belong Rumiko Takahashi.<br/>Sailor Moon and characters belong to Naoko Takeuchi.<br/>I am not writing these stories in any way for profit. They are free to whoever wants them. They are only fanfiction. If anyone wants to write any divergences, or such or even rewrit the story period, please feel free to do so. I only ask that you e-mail me a copy or web page address of where to read them from. I know, I suck at writing these, but I think I'm actually starting to get better. If for any reason that somebody decides to repost any of my stories, go ahead. I know I originally said that Ryoga was going to be in chapter 2, but he was in this one. Sorry about the wait.<p>Rape is a serious matter and is a crime. If you have been raped and need somebody to talk to or need help, here are a few numbers that you can call:<p>National Domestic Violence Hotline:<br/>1-800-799-SAFE<br/>RAINN rape-crisis hotline:<br/>1-800-656-HOPE<br/>Girls and Boys Town:<br/>1-800-448-3000<p>If you have any comments, questions or flames; please feel free to e-mail me. I take all comments seriously in order to improve my writing.<br/>Thanks, Gatomonomega.<p>
