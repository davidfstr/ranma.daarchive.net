</div>Trials &amp; Curses Chapter 4<br/>This story contains mature subject matter such as rape, abuse and depression. Be Forewarned.<p>Pluto leaned her weight onto the time staff trying to catch her breath. The strain of trying to look deeper into the incidents surrounding the devastation around crystal Tokyo. The only problem was that it just getting more and more difficult to get a clear picture anywhere in the time stream.<p>"That bitch is doing this somehow!" Pluto snarled, but how? Her whole body was covered in sweat, she seemed to be burning up with a fever and that was impossible. As long as she kept a link to the gate, her powers kept her from getting sick. It had to be that bitches doing, and the sooner Pluto killed Ranma the sooner the pain would stop.<p>But how did she know it would stop? It didn't matter though; all that mattered was protecting the future and stopping the pain.<p>* * * * *<p>"Pluto was infected with the virus." The man that kneeled before Lady Eclipse explained. She studied the man intently, he was just another pathetic droid. He had short black hair with gray eyes and pale skin. He wore black armor that seemed to absorb any light around it. The effect was quite amusing. Then she noticed the look of fear on his face, something was wrong.<p>"What of Uranus?" Lady Eclipse asked, she knew it would be another month before the crystal recharged enough to open another gate to get more of the poison.<p>"We missed her," the man said, trying to hide his face from the enraged woman. "We did get Jupiter though."<p>"Well, at least it wasn't wasted," Lady Eclipse said, leaning back into her throne. "what did you say your name was again?"<p>"Ebony, my Lady." The man croaked.<p>"Well, Ebony," Lady Eclipse smiled, "You deserve a reward for your trouble." She waved her hand and a black flame sprang up out of nowhere, completely engulfing Ebony. His screams of pain was music to her ears, she was annoyed when they stopped. The man collapsed onto the floor after the flames died. Lady Eclipse let him live incase she needed the fool again later.<p>It was going to be fun to watch the scouts destroy each other as the poisons took their effect on the sailor trash.<p>* * * * *<p>The first day at school went pretty well for Ranma despite having to wear the school uniform. It took an hour for Ranko and Nodoka to finally convince Ranma to put it on, then another two hours of arguing to get her to wear it to school. Ranma regretted the argument now, Ranko and Nodoka was only trying to help. The school wasn't going to allow Ranma to attend without a uniform and since she was stuck as a girl, she had to wear a girl's uniform. Part of Ranma may of accepted being a girl, but she still hated wearing dresses.<p>Ranma looked over her shoulder back to where Ranko was setting surprised to see her smile. Ranma smiled back and looked back to the front of the class. Maybe Ranko wasn't angry about the argument after all, which was good. The least Ranma wanted to do was make her mother or sister angry at her.<p>Lost in thought, Ranma almost missed the bell letting the class out. Finally it was the last period of the day which meant P.E. Ranma had a note dismissing her from any srenous activities and it was already decided that she would just act as assistant coach for the time being.<p>Ranma stopped outside the girls locker room, stealing herself to go in. She was a girl now, right? The only people here who knew that she was ever a boy was Ranko, Serena, Lita and Ami and they understood what Ranma was going through so there was nothing toi worry about.<p>Ranma pushed her way into the locker room a quickly glanced around the room at all the girls that were half undressed as they changed into their gym uniforms. Nothing. Ranma felt nothing looking at these girls. Why? Was it because of the curse? Was she a real girl now, both inside and out.<p>Ranma was brought out of her thoughts as someone slapped her across the face. Ranma looked up at Lita hate filled face. Why was Lita acting like this, when Ranko introduced them several days ago she seemed to like Ranma.<p>"What are you doing in here, you FREAK!" Lita spat out, raising her fist to strike again. Ranma shut her eyes in fear, instinctively wrapping her arms around her stomach to protect the baby. When the punch never came, Ranma opened her eyes to see Ranko's back as she faced off against Lita.<p>"Are you all right?" Ranko asked, looking back at Ranma. Tears were flowing freely down Ranma's face as she turned and fled the locker room.<p>* * * * *<p>Akane looked at the address that Kasumi gave her as she got off the train. Kasumi finally gave in and told here where Ranma went after promising not to tell the fathers. At first Akane wasn't going to come, but her guilt from the way she treated Ranma finally won out. Even if Ranma turned her away, she still had to come and apologize.<p>She checked the map she bought and started off down the street towards her destination when she walked right into Ranma. The redheads hair was loose about her shoulders and she was wearing a school uniform that resembled something like a sailors. There was something off about the girl though and Akane couldn't figure it out.<p>"Ranma," Akane asked, "Can we talk?"<p>The redhead looked strangely at Akane before asking, "Who are you?"<p>"You know who I am!" Akane exclaimed, trying not to lose her temper, "Look, I just want to talk to you."<p>Ranma's face lit up in recognition as she asked, "Akane Tendo?"<p>Akane nodded just before being knocked off her feet by Ranma's punch. "Stay away from my sister if you don't want to end up in the hospital!"<p>Anger boiling over, Akane jumped up, mallet now in hand and prepared to strike with it. She never got the chance as Ranma hit her several quick times, effectively knocking her out.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranko couldn't believe what Lita did to Ranma. Lita was one of Ranko's closest friends and she promised to help Ranma fit in. Instead, Lita attacked Ranma and called her a freak in front of the everybody in the girl's locker room. Well Lita may have been a friend, but Ranma was family so Ranko did the only thing she could at the moment. She pounded Lita's face in. If it wasn't for Ami and Serena, Ranko would of probably hurt Lita pretty bad. Too bad Serena and Ami broke the fight up, a part of Ranko really wanted to get a few more hits in because of the freak comment.<p>She searched the whole school after calming down and couldn't find a sign of Ranma anywhere. Ranko took off towards home hoping that was where Ranma was. At least Nodoka was off of work today, she'll be able to make sure Ranma doesn't do anything too stupid.<p>Lost in her thoughts, Ranko almost didn't recognize the girl with long blue hair in front of her. "Ranma, can we talk?" the girl asked.<p>"Who are you?" Ranko asked her, wondering why this girl seemed so familiar.<p>"You know who I am!" the girl snapped, obviously getting pissed for no reason, "Look, I just want to talk to you."<p>Ranko knew she should know this girl for some reason. She was wearing a school uniform from Furinkan from Nerima Ward. Realization finally dawned on Ranko, the girl fit the description of the girl Ranma told her about a few nights back. What was her name, that's right! "Akane Tendo?" Ranko asked.<p>The girl nodded. 'Two fights in one day, mom is going to be pissed.' Ranko thought as she punched the girl knocking her to the ground. "Stay away from my sister if you don't want to end up in the hospital!" Ranko said.<p>The girl must have been stupid or something, she jumped up to attack Ranko with a giant wooden mallet. Where the girl got the mallet at, Ranko had no idea. Only thing Ranko knew was that she wanted to end this quickly so she could check on Ranma. Throwing a few quick punches Ranko easily knocked the girl out.<p>Normaly, she wouldn't leave somebody like that but after the way Akane treated Ranma, there was no way Ranko was going to help the girl out . Ranko hurried the rest of the way home, praying that Ranma was there. She was beginning to worry that she may of went somewhere else after leaving the school.<p>Ranko hurried into the house, feeling both relieved and saddened at the sight on the couch. She was relieved that Ranma didn't try to kill herself, something that Ranko dreaded after what Lita did. She was saddened because Ranma on the couch in the living room crying her eyes out in their mother's arms.<p>"What happened?" Nodoka whispered as Ranko sat down on the couch next to her mother and sister. Ranko rubbed Ranma's back in soothing motions as she told Nodoka what happened back at the school. Ranko could tell her mother was pissed big time so decided against telling her about Akane for the moment. Besides, Ranko didn't want Ranma to hear what happened with the mallet-wielding bitch.<p>Ranma's sobs quieted down as her breathing started to come in regular breaths, she must have fallen asleep. Ranko sighed as she was reminded yet again how fragile Ranma really was. Ranma did a good job at hiding her feelings at times, pretending nothing was wrong. There was something wrong though, and it was all Genma's fault. For the millionth time since Ranma came back, Ranko found herself cursing her father's name. If the bastard never took Ranma in the first place, none of this would be happening now.<p>"Mom, what about Genma?" Ranko whispered.<p>"They searched the Tendo Dojo but couldn't find him," Nodoka replied, "Ranko, I want you to be careful until he's caught."<p>"I will." Ranko said, promising herself to start carrying her katana around in case the bastard showed up. "I'll keep an eye out on Ranma also."<p>Nodoka smiled as she nodded, both pride and worry clearly reflecting in her eyes.<p>* * * * *<p>Pluto knew that if she didn't act soon, she would lose her chance to destroy the bitch who was bringing her so much pain. Sometime in the next few days she would make her move then the hurting would stop. It had to stop.<p>* * * * *<p>Genma packed his gear getting ready to go to Jubaan after Ranma. The police that came earlier that day was looking for a bold martial artist and not a panda so it was easy to avoid them. At least Genma learned where his property was. Ranma was in Jubann with his mother and if he refused to come Genma would kill Nodoka. However, he had other plans for Ranko though. She would bring some good money from one of the brothels in Hong Kong. He knew some of the owners and they would come pick Ranko up if she was good looking enough, and judging from the pictures Nabiki got for him, she was. After all, Ranko looked almost exactly like her brother's female half.<p>For a moment, Genma debated selling Ranma too, but he needed the brat in order to secure his future. After all, Ranma was Genma's meal ticket so couldn't be sold after all. No Ranma, no dojo was all there was to it.<p>* * * * *<p>Lady eclipse was laughing her ass off at the brat who was Sailor Jupiter, it was just too rich. The poison was designed for Uranus not Jupiter, so it was affecting the brown haired nuisance a lot differently. Not only did the brat attack a pregnant girl, she attacked the mother of the future Sailor Pluto. On top of that, the other scouts wasn't speaking to Jupiter because of it. The scouts was starting to fall apart which was what she wanted, though she wanted to destroy the outer scouts first.<p>The poison was supposed to make Uranus go made and finally kill her lover Neptune and that brat Saturn. Then Pluto and Uranus was to kill each other because of the paranoia the poison in Pluto was supposed to be causing her. Paranoid bitch against psycho bitch, both of them killing each other in their weakened condition.<p>Only the poison in Jupiter was making her stronger instead of weaker which could end up causing trouble. For now though, Lady Eclipse was enjoyed watching as Jupiter attacked her friends.<p>An evil thought crossed her mind, how well would they be able to fight a droid if they kept attacking each other. "Droid Crystalis, arise."<p>A woman that seemed to be made out of crystal rose out of the floor before Lady Crystalis. "Yes my Lady."<p>"Wait until most of the scouts are together, but make sure Jupiter is among them, then attack them."<p>Crystalis nodded and sank back down through the floor while Lady Crystalis's laughter could be heard throughout the chamber, "This is going to be so rich!"<p>* * * * *<p>Ebony looked on at the meeting with Lady Eclipse and Droid Crystalis with disgust. He'd make that ungrateful bitch pay! He was one of the last of the Dark Moon Family and he wasn't going to let some whacked out bitch get away with what she did to him. All he had to do was bide his time and strike when the time was right.<p>* * * * *<p>Ranma 1/2 and characters belong Rumiko Takahashi.<br/>Sailor Moon and characters belong to Naoko Takeuchi.<br/>I am not writing these stories in any way for profit.
