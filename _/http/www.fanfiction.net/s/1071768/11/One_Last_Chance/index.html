</div>One Last Chance ch.11<p>**** The Short Trip Home****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. After meeting their patron god Loki and discovering that they were his chosen, they talked with him while he explained their situation and filled them in on part of the situation they now found themselves in. Ryoga and his companion continue on their travels trying to reach Nerima. Shampoo also heads towards the small ward where our main characters live. At the end of the chapter Loki used two rings to remove something from Akane and Ranma. As we left them last time said balls of energy were floating away from the two and towards Loki's rings. We now join the couple again to see what is happening.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"No"<p>Ranma gasped as he felt part of his life energy leaving him. He opened his eyes to see a blue ball of his life energy drifting towards Loki and the rings he wore. In his peripheral vision he saw a similar ball drifting away from Akane, the only difference was that the ball leaving Akane was red.<p>Akane herself was down on her hands and knees struggling to keep from sprawling face down on the ground. Ranma wasn't in much better condition; he was on his knees struggling against what felt like a huge weight pressing down on him.<p>The balls of energy continued on towards Loki's hands and the rings it wore.<p>Before Ranma and Akane's eyes, the energy that had been stolen from them entered the rings. As the two balls of energy entered the rings the pressure that was on them suddenly ceased crushing them.<p>The two gasped in relief as they stood up, leaning on the other for support.<p>When they finally felt strong enough to do anything besides lean on the other, although that in and of itself was quite enjoyable, they turned to look at Loki.<p>Loki was examining the two rings he now held. They were still silver, but now one had a beautiful red ruby set in it, and the other had a sparkling blue sapphire in it.<p>"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO US," Ranma screamed at the smiling god as he approached them.<p>"Nothing really, I extracted a part of your permanent chi, don't worry it's a small part, it won't hurt you to be missing it." Loki's voice was calm.<p>"You just took a part of us and you expect us not to worry, why did you do that," Akane yelled at the god.<p>"Well I'm going to give you a replacement with an equal amount of energy in it so it wouldn't affect you at all."<p>"Huh?" Both fiancées exclaimed.<p>Loki laughed at their befuddled expressions, not failing to miss the hurt, betrayal and anger behind the looks.<p>Way to go Loki, just go and suck out there energy, what did you really expect them to thank you, you haven't even told them why you did it, oh yeah, you wanted to get out of the square knot she put you in, uh oh, they're looking at me funny, better start explaining before things get worse. Loki mentally berated himself.<p>"Well you see, I extracted equal amounts of chi from both of you and put them in the rings, now I'm giving you the rings, so that way you get the chi back."<p>"Huh?"<p>Loki realized he needed to do a better job explaining than that if he was going to get them to understand what he did and why he did it.<p>"Well I took out your chi and put it in the rings, now I'm going to give the rings to you two as wedding presents. This way you'll both always be connected to the other and be able to carry around a piece of the other with you at all times."<p>The two staggering fiancées held out their hands for the rings. Loki first gave Akane the sapphire ring and then gave Ranma the ruby ring. The two looked at the rings then Loki and back to the rings, suspicion clearly evident on their faces.<p>Loki watched on expectantly, waiting for the two to accept his gift.<p>After a little bit more hesitation both fiancées finally relented and slipped the beautifully forged pieces of jewelry onto their ring fingers.<p>Both of them waited, glancing from the rings to Loki, back to the rings, and expectantly looking around as if waiting for something to happen to the two of them.<p>"There now, you see, that wasn't so bad, now was it?"<p>Both martial artists looked at Loki for a moment before turning to look at each other. Even without speaking they both shared a mutual thought, an evil grin forming on Ranma's face while Akane's eyes sparkled dangerously.<p>"Oh Loki," Ranma asked.<p>"Yes child, what is it?"<p>"The ring fits perfectly now, but what will happen when I change into my cursed form, won't it slip off?"<p>"Not at all, the rings are magical and yours will resize itself perfectly to fit you. In addition neither ring can be removed without the wearers consent."<p>Loki sounded pretty proud of himself.<p>"That's all I wanted to know, thanks."<p>"No problem, you're wel . . . What are you doing?"<p>Both fiancées stalked towards the chaos god, vengeance burning in their eyes, but also a small amount of mirth.<p>"Loki would you please change into a snake again for me, I didn't get to have a good look last time." Akane's voice was saccharine and if Loki hadn't been a god, he would have sworn that he felt a cavity forming.<p>"Ummm . . . No, I don't think so."<p>"That's fine one forms as good as another," Akane replied<p>The pair was really close to Loki right now and the god took a step backwards, even Thor having a temper tantrum wasn't as scary as these two.<p>"LOKI NO BAKA," the duo's call sounded loud and clear through the forest.<p>Akane and Ranma then demonstrated that when receiving a divine wrath beat- down, one form really was just as good as another.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Jungles of Columbia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Two people who we are very familiar with by now are running through undergrowth side by side, dodging past trees and running for all they are worth.<p>"Ranma this is all your fault," Ryoga yelled.<p>"Ahhh give it a break already, how the hell is this his fault," Ryoga's companion yelled back.<p>"If it wasn't for him we wouldn't be here," the lost boy reasoned.<p>"I didn't see him around when you said, 'hey, why don't we ask those people loading that sugar onto the plane where we are?' where was he when you walked over to them without a second thought and started talking?"<p>The two zigzagged to avoid the fire from the automatic weapons their pursuers were using.<p>Ryoga silently cursed Ranma for his problems, his companion just plain cursed as a spray of bullets embedded themselves in the tree ahead of the two.<p>"Come on, this looks like the right way," Ryoga broke right, breaking through some trees out into what seemed to be a gully. His companion was right on Ryoga's heels, with company just behind.<p>As the two boys raced down the gully, their pursuers pulled up short and regrouped. They knew this are well, their quarry had chosen poorly, there was no way in or out of this culvert and almost no places to hide. The two foreigner spies would be caught, tortured and killed.<p>The men began walking down the culvert, checking all the hiding spaces in the place. Soon the two would be caught and taken, and then the fun would begin.<p>It goes without saying that once the armed men reached the end of the culvert after having checked all the hiding places around they were surprised by the lack of their quarry.<p>Them men would search until darkness fell, they searched all over the area, but still not a sign of the two they were pursuing.<p>As night fell they huddled by they're campfire and told of the Wendigo and other dark spirits that lurked out beyond the light of the fire. Spirits, which could vanish without a trace and would lead men to their doom.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Himalayan Mountain Range ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"RANMA SAOTOME, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!"<p>"WOULD YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP ALREADY?"<p>A loud rumbling filled the air prompting two more outbursts.<p>"AVALANCHE!"<p>"RAN-NOT AGAIN!"<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Oh myself, in the name of all that is chaotic and unpredictable, I don't think I have a single part of me that doesn't hurt."<p>Ranma and Akane were finishing packing their gear for the trip back to Nerima.<p>"It was meant to hurt," Ranma growled.<p>Loki had begun to regret not turning into a snake, rule number thirty four be damned, a human form has a lot more bones that can be affected by being twisted then a snake does.<p>As it was he would probably win an award at any contortionist convention for his impression of a human pretzel, courtesy of one Akane Tendo and one Ranma Saotome.<p>"Think he's had enough yet," Ranma asked his fiancée.<p>"Yeah, I'm not that mad anymore, he just surprised me and I thought he was doing something bad to us. Of course it was a mean trick to play in the first place."<p>"Hey, it was meant to be payback for tying me into a knot around YOUR fiancée."<p>Akane walked over to the god and leaned over him.<p>"So do you want me to untie you or knot?"<p>Loki bit back the retort he was about to say and just nodded to his chosen.<p>A few quick twists and pulls that would have made most chiropractors proud and Loki was back into his proper form . . . more or less.<p>"Well, you two ready to let bygone be bygones," Ranma asked from where the packs were situated.<p>Loki stood up and extended his hand to Akane who took the hand and pulled the chaos god into a hug.<p>Putting her mouth close to his ear she whispered, "try something like that again and I'll show you what happens when I get really angry."<p>Loki chuckled and replied, "don't worry that was a one time only instance, it won't happen again."<p>Akane pulled away from the hug and smiled.<p>"Good then it's settled and I forgive you for what you did."<p>Loki was about to respond with a scathing retort, but upon seeing the frantic gestures for silence and the pleading looks Ranma was shooting him, the god decided better of it.<p>"Well I guess it's time for you two to head back to Nerima and I'd better get back myself, who knows how much law and order has managed to influence people while I've been gone." Loki struck a pose reminiscent of Kuno, "never fear people, Loki is here to spread fun, enjoyment, and chaos."<p>With one final wave to Ranma and Akane who were staring at him like he'd grown another head, well actually he had grown two more heads, but lets not quibble about that, he disappeared.<p>Ranma and Akane stood staring for a moment at the ground where the Chaos god had once stood.<p>"Well I guess it's time to go home," Ranma ventured still a little shaken as everything that had happened since the chaos god made his appearance into camp.<p>Akane who was in much the same situation just nodded.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hokkaido, Japan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Hokkaido, thank the gods."<p>"Are you sure?"<p>Ryoga's companion glared at him with a look that spoke volumes.<p>"Yes, that sign says Hokkaido, from this point on I am going to be the one leading us. I'm sure we can get to Tokyo in no time whatsoever, but if you offer any directions I'm going to staple your mouth shut."<p>Ryoga didn't like his companion's implications, sure he wasn't the best at finding his way somewhere and it usually took him a tiny bit longer, well actually a lot longer, in fact getting somewhere as far away as five- hundred yards away could take anywhere from four days to a week.<p>Of course there was that one time where he got to the kitchen from his room in twenty minutes, it wasn't his kitchen, but didn't decrease the splendor of the act. If only the refrigerator hadn't been moved he would have made himself something to celebrate, but some unthinking soul had replaced the refrigerator with a large capacitor and added a bunch of power cables.<p>"Fine, but I know several short cuts that will help get us there faster."<p>Ryoga's companion just stared at him with what can only be described as a shocked expression.<p>"You honestly believe that don't you?"<p>Ryoga nodded, "of course I do, I can get anywhere," he quietly added in a voice barely above a whisper, "eventually."<p>"Ok pal, let's try it this way, you follow me, don't do anything, but follow me, never let me out of your sight, don't offer any advice or go your own way. Just. Follow. Me. Got that?"<p>Ryoga nodded.<p>The pair started walking for Tokyo, going in the correct direction for once.<p>Ryoga's companion let out a sigh of relief, soon he'd meet up with the elusive Ranma Saotome and put certain matters to rest, despite Ryoga's random wandering he considered himself lucky, if Ryoga hadn't told him the location of Ranma, it might have been months before he finally located his quarry.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outskirts of Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>They had been walking for most of the morning and were finally entering Tokyo. Neither of the two fiancées had felt like saying much, both were still brooding on the events that had happened over what was meant to be a simple training trip.<p>Ranma glanced at his fiancée who was walking beside him down the path and gasped.<p>Hearing her fiancée gasp Akane quickly looked around, but saw nothing noteworthy in the general vicinity; she turned back to Ranma and saw that he was staring at her.<p>"Ranma, what is it?"<p>Ranma lifted a hand and pointed at Akane's head, "your . . . hair."<p>"What's wrong with my hair Ranma," Akane asked reaching back to feel her ponytail.<p>Her hands passed through nothing. She reached up higher and felt again, she repeated the process till she eventually felt the ends of her hair, much shorter, it hadn't been this short since Ryoga's belt had cut it off.<p>"My hair," Akane mumbled in disbelief, "When did it, how did it?"<p>"I have a feeling I know what's wrong."<p>"What would that be Ranma," Akane growled at Ranma as if he had been the one too cut off her hair, not quite again, but that fight with Ryoga was close enough.<p>"Well if you remember Loki cast a spell on us that would age our bodies back up to the point we were at, he said it would take a few weeks to two months. So our bodies are progressing at a much faster rate. If you remember, in a few days Ryoga cuts of your hair. Well it looks like everything that happened to us is happening to us again."<p>Akane sighed, "I wonder how this is going to affect us this time, I'd rather have kept my hair long this time."<p>"But you look so cute with short hair."<p>"Really?"<p>"Yeah, it looks good on you, and it's much more efficient in fights than long hair."<p>"Then why do you keep your hair long?"<p>"It's not so much a fashion choice as much as necessity. It's the dragon's whisker, if you remember, without it in my hair, I can't change back into a guy without it growing way to fast."<p>Akane stared at Ranma's face a moment before leaning in and touching something on his cheek.<p>"What is it Akane?"<p>"You're right Ranma."<p>"I am," Ranma was confused, what was he right about this time, and why did she need to tell him he was right if he knew he was, even though he didn't know what it might be which he was right about.<p>"Yes, remember how Ryoga got you with his thumb and cut your cheek, you have that scar there again."<p>Ranma reached up and felt the scar he had gotten, over two years it had faded down to nothing, but touching his cheek Ranma felt the new scar tissue although as it was, it was rapidly fading.<p>"Man, this is going to take some getting used too."<p>"Don't worry Ranma, as you've told me several times before, we'll get through this together, just look on the bright side of things."<p>"And what would that be?"<p>"You don't actually have to go through all those things you went through last time that gave you your scars."<p>"I hope so Akane, I sure hope so."<p>Akane started walking again, heading further into Tokyo.<p>Glancing back, Ranma saw Akane's hair where it had fallen, still tied by a ribbon. Darting back he picked up the lock of hair before continuing on and catching up with Akane.<p>Together the two continued their walk back to their home and whatever might await the two of them.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Shampoo's camp, outside Osaka ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Shampoo leapt around her camp practicing with her arsenal of various weapons.<p>She wasn't very pleased with her fighting skills, her trip through China and finally into Japan had been excellent for her tracking and hunting skills, but her actual combat skills had suffered greatly due to the lack of adequate fights. After all, those weakling bandits, thugs, thieves, and rapists who had tried to stop her at certain points hardly counted as a challenge to someone with Shampoo's skills.<p>As rusty as her skills were, they were still considerable.<p>Maybe she wouldn't wait as long as she had originally planned before going after the redhead. One way or another by the end of the month she'd have caught up to this Ranma girl and it would be over.<p>Shampoo began to fume and build up her anger as she thought of all the close calls that had happened back in China. The Ranma girl and her pet panda had almost fallen into her trap time after time, but somehow Shampoo's prey would evade her.<p>Sometimes it seemed like the panda was even the one helping the girl, it was amazing how skilled in the arts the panda was, but a dumb animal could only be so smart. Maybe she'd take the panda for her own pet after the girl was dead.<p>The thought of the girl dead was still a sore point for Shampoo, the girl had to die, but Shampoo knew she would regret it when she finally dealt the killing blow to her quarry.<p>It's best not to think such thoughts, after all, it's the girls own fault that she beat me, she should have known what would happen.<p>A rustling in the trees behind her made the Amazon warrior turn around, holding the Bonbori she was practicing with in a ready position. Her eyes scanned the trees for any sign of an interloper.<p>It was times like this that she wished her Japanese was better, she didn't want to call out in Chinese since whoever it was probably wouldn't understand.<p>A rustling behind her made Shampoo spin and throw one of her two weapons towards the noise.<p>It was deflected almost effortlessly by the intended target, which spoke to her while chuckling.<p>"Nice throw child, but there is no need to attack me, I am here to assist in your pursuit of Ranma, I will help you complete your task."<p>Shampoo not knowing what to say in response to the newcomer just stood there shocked at the ease at which her attack had been deflected.<p>She was so shocked she didn't even realize the newcomer had spoken to her in Chinese.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Compound, Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>It was late afternoon by the time Ranma and Akane got home, the two had made good time on their trip back, both very eager to sample some of Kasumi's home cooking. They were both slightly tired as they had both elected not to stop for lunch or breaks.<p>"It's good to be home," Ranma stated as the two came to a stop before the front gates.<p>Ranma rolled his shoulders to work out the kinks that had built up during he walk.<p>Akane merely nodded, not in as good shape as Ranma she was really too tired to say anything.<p>The to walked through the gates and entered the house, both too tired to call out their presence<p>"I wonder what has happened while we were gone," Ranma said, depositing his shoes in the foyer.<p>There are many things in life which people learn, one such thing is sometimes it's better off not knowing certain details. Ranma is about to learn one such detail.<p>"Oh Ranma-kun, Akane, welcome home," Kasumi greeted them as they shut the door and were about to head upstairs.<p>"Hi Kasumi," The pair responded unenthusiastically, they had hoped to get up to their rooms and maybe get a little sleep before going back to school tomorrow, with any luck the Kuno situation would have been sorted out by their discussion and they'd have one less rival/love interest/obsessive lunatic to deal with.<p>"Oh my, you two look exhausted, if you think you can stay awake for another hour I'll have dinner ready."<p>"Thanks Kasumi, some good home cooking sounds great right about now, if you'll excuse us though, we need to drop off our stuff and get changed."<p>"That's fine," Kasumi began to walk back towards the kitchen but turned around before going round the corner, "Oh my, I almost forgot that father and Mr. Saotome would like to see you two once you're ready."<p>Ranma and Akane groaned as Kasumi turned the corner. The last two times they'd been informed that their parents wanted to talk to them they had ended up almost married to other people or married to each other, all in all the second wasn't so bad, but they just weren't ready yet.<p>"Thanks Kasumi, we'll be down soon."<p>The two went upstairs and bathed separately, cleaned up and went downstairs, on guard for anything their parents might try.<p>They entered the living room glancing from side to side at full alert, just waiting for an assault from any direction. Thankfully the caution was for naught, as Genma and Soun were sitting inside at the table.<p>Unfortunately sitting there was a person whom they did not want to see.<p>Kuno.<p>There were several things apparent immediately to the two martial artists; the first was that Kuno was sitting there in their home smiling his triumphant smile. The second was Nabiki sitting across from him with a scowl on her face. Finally the fact that Soun and Genma had a bottle of their celebration Sake out and that it wasn't yet open.<p>"Dad, Mr. Saotome, what is Kuno doing here," Akane hesitantly asked.<p>"Well, this nice young man has come and asked for your hand in marriage," Soun ventured.<p>"NICE YOUNG MAN," Akane screamed, "This nice young man is responsible for having a horde of boys attack me every day with the hopes of conquering me."<p>"Surely you can see I had but your best interests at heart fair fiancée."<p>"Well that's all in the past now isn't it," Soun nervously stated<p>"But Akane and I are engaged already, to each other," Ranma protested.<p>"Not anymore son, as it is a matter of family honour I've transferred the engagement to Nabiki so Akane can be betrothed to this young man as they both want."<p>Ranma and Akane saw red.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Evil villains chuckle manically, evil villains laugh maniacally, and evil villains don't laugh. This makes it hard to explain why at the moment a certain armoured figure was rolling around on an obsidian floor laughing for all the figure was worth.<p>"You know that really isn't very dignified," the cloaked figure standing off to the side factually stated, although the cloaked figure was very tempted to fall down and break out laughing. Those idiots were just too funny at times.<p>"I don't care, I thought those fools were going to do something damaging, now all their going to do is get a good ass kicking from the godslayer." The figure continued laughing.<p>You might be right, but there might be more here then meets the eye.  The cloaked figure just stood there staring at the viewing portal.<p>The armoured figure continued laughing. The cloaked figure's gaze watched the unfolding scene before it.<p>Only one of the two was laughing.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TBC, End of Chapter 11 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Well that's this chapter done. Due to school this chapter has taken longer than I expected to complete. I will try to continue at the rate of one chapter a week, but I might have to take a week and a half to get new chapters up.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
