</div>One Last Chance ch.8<p>**** A Time to Live ****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter the couple went on a training trip together to get themselves up to speed. In the process, they got closer together and discussed what would happen. Ryoga also narrowly missed running into them by just a few dozen yards.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, noon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>The wilds of Japan are a peaceful and calm place. Compared to the crowded cities the wilderness offers a quiet tranquility where one can escape the hustle of life and its hardships of modern life.<p>Many people do escape to the woods where they can rest and relax away from the rest of Japan. Many people lay back and enjoy the sights and sounds of the wilderness. They appreciate the pristine beauty of the forest and try to leave it as nice as possible for other people.<p>Ranma and Akane are not two of these people. This is very apparent as one of Akane's stray punches hit a tree, which never did any harm to anybody. The oak was very thick and had grown for many years and was solid enough to resist many strokes with an axe. Akane had pulled her punch as soon as she saw it was going to miss Ranma.<p>The tree never stood a chance. The tree's only mistake was to grow in the wrong location. None of this mattered as the tree fell though. As a matter of fact, Akane never even paid attention to the falling tree as she already had turned away, raising an arm to block one of Ranma's kicks.<p>The two were training for all they were worth and nothing could distract the pair of martial artists from their sparring, not even a falling tree that Ranma evaded without thought as he was pushed back by a flurry of blows from Akane could break their concentration.<p>Sweat poured from both of them as they trained relentlessly. The two, having enjoyed the company of their partner during the night were very unwilling to risk loosing their bedmate. As a result, today's training session was even more rigourous than the previous day's training.<p>Ranma dodged around like he usually did, but unlike his original arrival a few days/ 2 years ago, he would occasionally throw a punch or a kick at Akane whenever he saw a hole in her defenses. When his strikes did pierce her defenses, the blow would sting Akane slightly, not enough to really hurt her, but powerful enough to remind her not to let her defenses down.<p>The blows he dealt to her were almost as painful to Ranma as they were to Akane. The difference between their pains though was in where the damage was dealt. Akane's pain was felt in her skin, flesh, and bones. Ranma's pain was felt in his very self. Every pain he caused Akane hurt him too, because he knew he was the one who was causing Akane to suffer. Even though he knew it was necessary for her training and that he had to do it to make her better, it didn't help the pain it caused inside him.<p>Akane knew that Ranma loved training her, but hated hitting her even though she could take it. So she decided to call a break by dropping out of her stance. It had absolutely nothing to do with the fact Ranma's last strike had put her in a bad position. It definitely had nothing to do with the fact that her body was beginning to ache from the training they were doing and had done. It most assuredly had no correlation to how she wanted nothing more than him to hold her and give her the massage she was dieing for. Finally and without a doubt or any chance in hell was the matter of calling a break because she was tired.<p>Or at least that she'd be willing to admit.<p>Akane began the first real conversation the two had held that day about anything besides martial arts or combat.<p>"You're good Ranma Saotome, you are worthy of a truly strong, skilled, and gifted wife to call your own." Akane said, leading Ranma towards the recently fallen tree, which had thankfully missed falling on their canteens by a very narrow margin.<p>"And you, Akane Tendo, are also worthy of a strong, skilled, and gifted husband to call your own."<p>"Really, do you know where I can find one?" Akane asked with a coy smile.<p>"I think I might have a few ideas."<p>"Oh really?"<p>"Yes and where might that be?" It was fun to tease Ranma, but it was even more fun when he didn't get flustered and he actively participated in the fun.<p>"Right here," he said, taking her hand and placing it upon his chest, right over his heart. An almost electric tingle ran through her body at the feel of her hand over his pectoral muscles. She could feel his every breath and it excited her, but she was about as willing to admit that, as she was her reasons for taking a break.<p>"And you shall find your own companion right here." Akane replied, reaching out and taking Ranma's hand. She put it over her own heart, knowing Ranma was both too shy and too much of a gentleman to do anything further without her guiding him. Of course he'd never be able to admit to his shyness. In as long as Akane had known Ranma, she had always been forced to make the first move in any physical contact. It was slightly irritating, but Akane knew that after she opened each door for him he would be willing to enter the places she left open for him and only him.<p>"Have I told you today how much I love you?" Ranma asked, staring into Akane's eyes.<p>"Not since last night."<p>"That's too long a time for it then."<p>Akane waited a few moments to hear his words, but they didn't come."<p>"Well?" She asked impatiently.<p>"Well what?" Ranma asked innocently.<p>"Well aren't you going to say it?"<p>"Say what?"<p>Akane was getting irritated at his playing dumb.<p>"I love you."<p>"Thanks, I love you too."<p>Akane blinked in shock at how Ranma had gotten her to say the words she was trying to have him say. Only he managed to make her say the words before he did.<p>"Why you, I oughta." Akane growled.<p>Ranma stuck out his tongue in response.<p>"What have I told you Ranma, don't stick that thing out unless you're willing to use it."<p>"Make me."<p>"Ok."<p>The two engaged in a passionate kiss, at least until they realized that they both needed more oxygen then they were receiving and had to break the kiss.<p>"You know, I think the nature has to hate us by now?"<p>"Why do you say that?"<p>"Well so far, I've destroyed two mountains, and together we've destroyed god only knows how many trees and other bits of foliage together."<p>Akane laughed at Ranma's comment, knowing it to be true.<p>"That's true Ranma, but at the same time contractors love us for all the work we give them. Just think of how much property damage there is in Nerima."<p>"You're right Akane, we need to talk to Nabiki into investing in some of those stocks when we get back. Maybe that way she'll be less inclined to sell pictures of us."<p>"Not all of those pictures were bad you know. Some of them were actually quite tasteful."<p>"Yeah I know, just don't expect me to admit that too Nabiki."<p>"That's fine as long as you admit it to me and yourself." Akane sounded quite content with Ranma's admission.<p>"Do you think we should talk about strategy some more?" Ranma asked Akane, looking for another conversation piece.<p>"No, not today Ranma, today, I don't want anything to spoil today, and I just know talking about the others will spoil today for us."<p>"Ok Akane, if that's what you want then why don't we go back to training."<p>"Sounds good to me." It actually didn't sound that good to her, she wanted to stay where they were and have Ranma put his arms around her and sit there just enjoying his strong warm arms holding her to his hard body.<p>Ranma stood up, holding out his hand. Akane took the offered hand and reluctantly stood. The two stepped into the middle of the clearing and prepared to fight.<p>In all actuality the clearing they were sparring in was a very new clearing that the two had inadvertently made while they were practicing. Fallen trees were all over the place. At the end of their workout Ranma and Akane would strip a tree, with their bare hands, chop it up into manageable pieces, they split the tree in two, once again with their bare hands, and then carry the halves back to camp, they also did this with their bare hands. Once back at camp the pair would then see who could turn their half of the tree into decently sized firewood. If you hadn't guessed by now from the previous three actions involving the tree, they did this with their bare hands as well.<p>"Ready to begin Akane?"<p>"Whenever you are Ranma"<p>The two leapt at each other and their sparring began.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ On a road in Osaka ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>On a road in the middle of Osaka stood two people talking, if talking is what you could call it. One guy was asking for directions and the other was trying to help.<p>The first guy was getting frustrated, the person he was talking too wasn't giving him very good directions and as a result he ended up starting to go the wrong way.<p>"So you're saying Nerima is that way?"<p>The second guy was getting even more frustrated than the first, when the first guy had asked for directions he had then tried to go off in the wrong direction. What was wrong with this guy?<p>"Yes for the fifth time, honestly, for someone who is so desperate to get to Tokyo, you sure don't want to go the right way."<p>Three guesses as too who the first guy is and the first two don't count. For those of you who are having trouble with guessing, he is wearing a yellow bandana, has fangs, and carries a red umbrella. If you don't know whom the first guy is, go out and read the manga or watch the anime, because your knowledge of the series is sorely lacking.<p>"I'm deadly serious, I have to get to Tokyo for revenge."<p>"Revenge huh? Well that's original, why are you out for revenge and against whom?"<p>"A coward, because of him I've seen hell."<p>"Hell huh, that's a pretty bad place from what I've heard. So once again who is this guy?"<p>"Ranma Saotome. I'm going to kill him for what he's done to me."<p>Ryoga would have continued talking except the other boy had his arms in a very powerful grip and was squeezing very hard, not enough to hurt Ryoga, but it was quite a bit stronger than any normal person. The exceptions to this were some crazy people, they were normal people, to an extent, but they were super strong. Ryoga had encountered a couple of these on his journeys, but the boy in front of him didn't seem to be crazy. As a matter of fact the look in his eye was the same one Ryoga had seen in his own a few times whenever he was thinking of Ranma and what he'd do to the coward when they met.<p>Now whether or not this can be considered a crazy look is just a matter of how sane a person is. To a very sane person yes this look might be crazy; to another no it wouldn't be considered crazy. Judge for yourself their actions then make up your judgment. As for the author, well the author himself has been accused of having a less than perfect hold on his own sanity so he won't be making a call one way or another.<p>"Ranma Saotome? Did you just say Ranma Saotome? Ranma Saotome as in the Ranma Saotome of the anything goes school of martial arts? Ranma Saotome as in the son of Genma Saotome?"<p>While the figure asked four questions they all could be summed up in one reply, which Ryoga promptly proceeded to do.<p>"Umm, yes."<p>The guy in front of him smiled a very predatory smile.<p>"Well in that case why don't I come with you, I also have to find Ranma Saotome, and I have my own revenge to carry out against him, why don't we help each other?"<p>"That sounds ok to me, if you're sure, I wouldn't mind some company."<p>"Ok, let's get going, I can't wait to finally get my shot at Ranma."<p>The second figure was so caught up in his thoughts of revenge he didn't notice the fact that Ryoga was going in the wrong direction. He followed Ryoga without a second thought to their actual destination.<p>Ryoga walked along, angry with Ranma for the trouble he caused everyone. He was also too caught up in his thoughts of punishing the pigtailed martial artist to notice where he was going. This really didn't matter because even if he had thought about where he was going and how to get there he would have gone the wrong way. A part of his mind told him that since his new traveling companion hadn't told him that they were going the wrong way, they must have been going the right way.<p>Together the two walked off, taking them further and further away from the target of their aggression. Whether they were better off doing this than they would have been otherwise is debatable. On one hand they were going further away from Ranma so they couldn't attack him. On the other hand they were going further away from Ranma so they wouldn't have to fight him.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, mid-evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Ranma and Akane had finished up their workout, and were hiking back to the campsite after their training that day. Both of them were exhausted and famished. Akane was trailing slightly after Ranma.<p>"Ranma, prepare to die." A voice yelled from somewhere behind him.<p>"Huh?" Ranma was startled by the sudden challenge, he cursed himself for not expecting trouble to find them even out here.<p>He twirled around, dropping into a fighting stance and dropping the half of the tree that he was carrying. His eyes searched the area around him searching for whoever made the challenge.<p>All he saw was Akane, holding her sides as she tried to stifle her laughter.<p>"And what was that for?" Ranma asked, quirking an eyebrow at his fiancée.<p>"Well, I thought you might be missing it since no one has yelled that particular phrase at you lately." Akane was trying very hard not to burst out laughing.<p>"Thanks, but that's one part of it all I think I could live without. In fact I know I can live without all those challenges."<p>" I hope so Ranma, but I have a feeling that even after we deal with the others of the Nerima wrecking crew showing up, we will still have to deal with the usual insanity of our lives. I don't think it will stop any time during our lives; all the chaos that follows us around won't ever stop, and since we'll be together it will get even worse."<p>"Nerima Wrecking Crew? Our chaos? I don't understand." Ranma looked quite confused.<p>"Try asking one question at a time Ranma, it will be a lot easier to answer your questions that way. Otherwise it might get a little confusing."<p>Ranma felt like slamming his head against one of the nearby trees, but he figured they already had enough trees knocked down to make a house so he merely put his face into his hands and groaned loudly.<p>Akane giggled for a moment before coming up and taking Ranma's hand. She led him back to their campsite. Anyone watching the two would have sworn off strong drink after seeing a teenage boy and teenage girl holding hands while carrying halves of a tree over their shoulders. Ranma contemplated quietly over what Akane said on their walk back to camp, letting Akane lead him. He was only marginally successful in contemplation.<p>Who knew Akane would of sweated that much or her clothes would cling to her body like that, or that her body was so finely toned and how perfect her . . . WOOO there Ranma, think about something else. Showers. Cold showers. Cold showers at home. Cold showers at home with Akane. Cold Showers with Akane naked. Cold showers with Akane naked and. WOOOO, bad Ranma, think about anything else besides Akane and how beautiful Akane looks and how Akane. ARGGGHH.<p>"ARRGGGHH."<p>"Is there something wrong Ranma?" Akane asked, looking at Ranma curiously.<p>Ranma for his part was blushing furiously as he realized that he yelled out loud.<p>"Well I was just thinking . . . um . . . What did you mean Nerima Wrecking Crew. Who or what is that?"<p>"Well it's funny really I once heard somebody refer to us as the Nerima wrecking crew."<p>"Us, who is us?"<p>"You, me, Ryoga, Kuno, Shampoo, and the others. After all the property damage we did we got the title of the Nerima Wrecking Crew. I think it's rather appropriate."<p>Ranma chuckled at the name.<p>"Yeah, that is a pretty appropriate title for us."<p>"Now Ranma, have you thought of how to ask your other question yet?"<p>"Huh, oh yeah, when you were talking about all the chaos that surrounded us, what did you mean us, don't you mean me?"<p>"Not really, it's true that things got really crazy since you showed up, but even before you arrived things were strange in my life. Remember the Hentai horde, that was just the tip of the iceberg, all my life things have been a little off the norm, after you showed up the things got worse, but it wasn't all you."<p>"Say that sounds about right, during my trip with pops, crazy things were happening all the time. When I got here things were calm for a little while, but then the craziness just picked up harder then ever. I always thought it was just because I was in one place this time, and things were just picking up. Now that you mention it, it would make sense, the chaos around the two of us combining. I guess we really are compatible."<p>They both laughed at that. They would have embraced, but the huge logs on their shoulders made that action impossible.<p>The two walked back to camp side by side this time.<p>Arriving in camp they dropped of the tree and turned it into kindling for the fire.<p>Ranma offered to cook, much to both of their relief. Akane was too tired to really cook and Ranma didn't want an incredibly bad case of indigestion that night.<p>After dinner, they went down to the stream to wash up. Akane lay on a towel Ranma spread out while he gave her a massage.<p>"You have magic fingers you know that don't you?" Akane asked, her muscles relaxing under his loving touch.<p>"Yeah I know."<p>"You have great technique."<p>"Yeah, I know."<p>"You have such a kind touch."<p>"Yeah, I know."<p>"And an ego the size of a planet."<p>"Yeah, I - hey what do you mean."<p>Akane laughed, rolling over and wrapping Ranma in a hug.<p>"That's ok, I still love you."<p>Ranma stood up, gathering Akane in his arms he headed for their shared tent.<p>"Ohh Ranma, you're so forceful." Akane giggled as Ranma carried her.<p>"You know you like it." Ranma growled as he tossed her over one shoulder so he could use his free hand to open the tent.<p>Akane just giggled as he brought her into the tent, zipping the flap shut behind them.<p>"I love you Ranma."<p>"I love you too Akane."<p>Holding each other the exhausted couple fell asleep.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo, Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"So you see Tendo, we can't allow them to go at this rate, the schools must be united."<p>"I agree with you Saotome, we have to get them married, but why the rush. The two of them are obviously in favor of marrying; they just don't want to be together yet. Why can't we give them a little time?"<p>"Soun my old friend, you know how these things are, yes they love each other now, but we never know when that might change. We can't allow them to break apart."<p>Also we need to get them together before any of the other girls who he got engaged too show up and try to claim him. Why must a father be so troubled by a disobedient son?<p>Genma had been working on Soun since the two had woken up. He suspected what would happen if the other girls he had engaged Ranma too over the years showed up before Ranma was married.<p>He considered himself lucky that those other two fiancées that showed up were ones he and Soun had both been responsible for. Soun would have no idea just how many fiancées Ranma had. As a matter of fact Genma himself didn't know how many fiancées he had given Ranma over the years.<p>"So you see Tendo, the boy and your daughter must be married, it is the only safe thing we can do."<p>In the past, Genma had always been able to talk Soun into things, since Kimiko's death he had been even easier to manipulate. This time was no different.<p>"Yes Saotome, I understand. Our children don't understand the problems their delay is causing we must show them the error of their ways."<p>"Together we can do it Tendo."<p>The two stood up and clasped arms the way one warrior would do with another.<p>"Now my friend let us plan," the two said in unison.<p>Outside the dojo two females figures just looked at each other, shaking their heads as they listened to the two men inside.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Mainland China ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Two figures were engaged in a very heated discussion. If one looked carefully, it could be seen that these two appeared in an earlier part of the chapter.<p>"I can't believe you, how the hell could you get us this badly lost?"<p>"You didn't say anything about the way we were going."<p>"I was lost in my thoughts, I can't even find us anywhere on the map." The person gestures to the now useless map of Japan that he was holding.<p>"Don't worry about maps, I found they really aren't that useful." Ryoga said, waving his hand dismissively.<p>"Then how the hell are we meant to know where we are?"<p>Ryoga shrugged, "simple, we just look for any landmarks that are familiar. Trust me."<p>"Ok, lead the way, but I swear if we don't find something familiar soon then I'm going to start leading, I'm not even sure if we're still in Japan."<p>"Of course we are. We haven't even had to cross any large body of water yet."<p>The two went off, heading for Mongolia.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Arggh I can't believe those three."<p>If the armoured figure had any hair it would be pulling it out in frustration. Things weren't going to plan.<p>"I can't believe this."<p>"Why don't you calm down? Your pacing is somewhat irritating."<p>The armoured figure forced itself to stop pacing and glare at the cloaked figure.<p>"My apologies, but things aren't going as they should be."<p>"You're talking about Ryoga and the fathers?"<p>"No I'm talking about Charon, Styx, and Cerberus. Of course I'm talking about Ryoga and the fathers. They're screwing things up. How the hell did Ryoga meet up with a companion? That shouldn't have happened."<p>"I think it might have had to do with your influence."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"Well, to keep Ryoga from running into Ranma and Akane you had to adjust his path. With Ryoga's sense of direction, that small alteration completely threw off his path, therefore it was impossible for the anybody to predict where he was going to go."<p>The armoured figure had stopped pacing by one of the obsidian walls and was in the process of beating its head against the walls, causing small cracks to appear in the black stone.<p>"Why are you irritated at the fathers anyway, they always pull this type of stunt?"<p>The armoured figure stopped beating its head against the wall to answer the cloaked figure.<p>"Those two always find a way to interfere, no matter what being has tried a plan that involves Ranma and Akane, those two old farts have always sprung one of their own plans at the same time and the two plans always fail because of the other."<p>"Let me guess, as far as you know, you're the only one with a plan going on right now?"<p>"Right, Loki is the only other one that has something going on with them, but he always has something going on that deals with those two."<p>"Well, maybe this time it will affect Loki's plan."<p>"Loki is pure chaos, it has no chance of affecting Loki's plan."<p>"Well maybe we could kill them?"<p>"Killing their fathers would definitely turn the godslayer and his mate away from us and make him an enemy I would rather not have. Besides, Genma is in Mask's favor, it would be foolish to provoke him. I rather value my property, and Mask could rapidly make me loose many of the items I've collected."<p>"True, but at least Genma's a fat slob that nobody, but that woman Nodoka would find attractive, and even then, she only likes him because of that stupid bet."<p>The armoured figure laughed at the cloaked figures words.<p>"Now that's a note I'm willing to end on."<p>The two figures laughed.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TBC, END OF CHAPTER 8 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Another year, another chapter. This chapter was a lot more fun to write then the previous one, especially since I got to include more humour then before.<p>I hope everyone is enjoying this story. If you are, then please review and tell me what you thought of this, I am always searching for comments on my writing and how I can improve it. If you have anything to say at all, please review.<p>A quick note, Mask is the god of thieves from the Forgotten Realms Dungeons and Dragons series.<p>As for the gods I will be including. I have studied Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Celtic, and Roman mythology. I also know a little about Chinese and Japanese legends. As a result, I will be including figures from all of these. In addition to those, I read a lot of forgotten realms books and I will be including the pantheons from that into the story.<p>Now, just who is the person with Ryoga, so many possibilities, so little time.<p>Hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
