</div>One Last Chance ch.15<p>**** The Love of Mother ****<br/>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<br/>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<br/>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter Ranma reveals how he switched the marriage contracts, engaging Nabiki to Kuno rather than Akane being engaged to the Kendoist. Nabiki is now stuck in an engagement to Kuno. Ryoga and his companion have finally made it to Tokyo, unfortunately they ran into Nodoka Saotome upon their arrival and Ryoga portrayed Ranma as a coward and unmanly. Ryoga and his companion after receiving directions from Kodachi arrived at Furinkan. Ryoga charged forwards and attacked Ranma while he and Akane were eating lunch. His companion stayed in the shadows watching the scene unfold. Ryoga ran rather than reveal his curse and subsequently got himself lost ... again. His companion stayed behind and watched Ranma. When he returned home, Ranma encountered his mother waiting there for him. Things might not be looking so good for our pigtailed martial arts hero right now.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo House, Evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"M-mo-mother," Ranma managed to get the word past the lump in his throat.<p>"Hello son, please sit, I believe it is time for us to talk," Nodoka's voice was colder than Ranma or Akane could remember and she had a dangerous glint in her eyes.<p>The two moved and sat opposite the Saotome matriarch, Akane felt a chill go up her spine and would have sworn Nodoka was using a version of the soul of ice.<p>"Ranma, it is time for us to discuss a certain pledge you made before you and your father left all those years ago."<p>The feelings of dread and panic began winning over in Ranma as his mother spoke, but he just sat there tight lipped while the colour drained from Akane's face.<p>"I see you're father has informed you of this contract," Nodoka emotionlessly stated, silently making note of the fear her son was trying not to show, but frowning in disapproval despite herself.<p>"Well I'm sorry, but it has come to my attention through old friends of yours that you are not the manly son I had hoped for. Fetch your tanto Ranma it is time for you to fulfill your end of the promise."<p>Ranma was shaking in fear while Akane was quivering in anger over what was happening in front of them, Ranma's mother wanted him to die.<p>Unable to refuse his mother, Ranma wordlessly left the room and retrieved his ceremonial dagger from his pack where he had kept it all these years, but had never understood until a short time ago why he and his father, both practitioners of a fighting style which eschewed weapons in favor of completely unarmed combat, carried around the daggers.<p>By the time Ranma had returned to the room, Nodoka had already prepared for the seppuku ceremony.<p>"I will give you until sunset to compose your funeral haiku, then you shall undergo the promise you made all those years ago."<p>Ranma mechanically penned his haiku before kneeling on the tatami mat. Akane sat there watching in horror the scene unfolding, she knew Ranma could never refuse his mother, but this was ludicrous, he wasn't even going to make a case in his defense, and his mother wasn't explaining why he should be killed, she was just going to chop off his head without even getting to know him.<p>"Wait Mrs. Saotome, you can't do this yet, what about Genma, shouldn't he be here," Akane managed to call out, trying to buy the man she loved a little time, there was no way Genma would stay human or stay in the Tendo compound while his wife was here.<p>"I will get to my husband in time, he must also fail for this breach of contract, but that does not excuse my son from his failure either," Nodoka's voice practically generated icicles, "ready Ranma?"<p>"Yes mother," Ranma replied, his voice betraying none of the betrayal and sorrow he felt was empty and emotionless.<p>Akane could do nothing but watch as Ranma lifted the tanto to his stomach and drove the point in, pulling to the left and then twisting up and pulling to make a bloody L in his stomach and completing the traditional cuts. To his credit Ranma's face betrayed no pain beyond the emotional suffering he was feeling, Ranma had never been good at hiding that type of pain.<p>A few moments later Nodoka's Katana came down, severing Ranma's head from his body. His pigtail fluttered lightly to the floor where it had been cut as the Katana sliced through it on the blade's trip towards Ranma's neck. A few moments later Ranma's lifeless body slumped to the floor.<p>As the body fell Ranma's head rolled forwards, coming to a stop in front of Akane she screamed when the lifeless eyes of her once fiancée came to look into hers. His face wearing a said look that betrayed the beauty he held in life.<p>Akane jerked out of the nightmare/daydream she was in, coming back into the here and now. She was aware of Ranma's hand tightly gripping her own hand. She gave his hand a little squeeze of reassurance and was relieved to feel Ranma's vice grip slacken tightly.<p>Unfortunately the here and now could very quickly turn into the horrible vision she just saw. Akane silently swore to herself that she would do anything to keep such a scene from playing itself out.<p>Nodoka quietly watched the interaction going on between her son and what must have been her son's fiancée. She wasn't willing to rule on the girl in her son's favor or not just yet. While at first glance she seemed like a nice girl, she was seemingly lacking in feminine traits, obviously an athlete, and her hair was awfully short. Now that Kasumi girl who had greeted her was a very nice and proper woman, maybe she should be the one her son was engaged to. Assuming he was the manly son she had hoped for.<p>"Mrs. Saotome," Akane began to say but was interrupted.<p>"Please call me Auntie dear."<p>"Thank you Auntie," Akane continued, "What is this contract you're talking about?"<p>Nodoka looked surprised for a moment that she didn't know, but relented deciding that her son and husband must not have mentioned such a private affair to those not yet part of the family.<p>"Well, before I would allow my husband to take my son from me, he made me a promise that if he didn't raise Ranma to be a man amongst men then both he and Ranma would commit seppuku, didn't my husband inform you of this?"<p>Ranma was able to find his voice long enough to utter a single sentence.<p>"Actually mother, I wasn't aware of the promise until about a week ago, and even then I only found out about it by accident."<p>Ranma's mother looked shocked for a few moments before her calm demeanor was back in place.<p>"Regardless, Ranma still made his promise even if you forgot about it the promise still binds you," Nodoka's tone was as firm as steel with determination.<p>"I don't think it matters if the promise still binds Ranma, after all he is a man amongst men, so he won't have to commit seppuku anyway," Akane's tone was both firm and hopeful, barely betraying any worry or fear she might be feeling.<p>Ranma felt his heart leap as Akane came to his defense, maybe he wouldn't have to feel the bite of cold steel today after all.<p>"I have heard otherwise to this point very much differs with that information."<p>Nodoka recalled that nice young manly boy she had met earlier that had assisted her on getting to the dojo.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flashback, Streets of Nerima, Earlier that day ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"Hmmm, the Tendo Dojo should be around here somewhere. The sooner I find it, the sooner I can see the results of my son and my husband's training, I do hope those boys I met earlier were mistaken."<p>Nodoka walked along the streets of Nerima, after talking with those two boys, she had decided the best thing to do would be to go visit the Tendos and find out if he husband and son really were there.<p>She had wondered why Genma had not come home if the training trip was now over and it was time to settle down and fulfill the engagement between the Saotome and Tendo clans. If he had decided to live with the Tendos for a while, then why had he not told her or sent word. As a matter of fact, he hadn't even sent a single letter since he had told her he was taking her son on a training trip to China for a while. The last letter had arrived saying he had made it to China and had found a famous training ground to take Ranma too.<p>Then a couple of months ago the letters had stopped and Nodoka had feared her son and husband dead until she ran into those young men yesterday.<p>The only reason Nodoka could imagine that Genma hadn't informed her that they were back in Tokyo was that he didn't believe she'd believe him manly enough and make Genma and Ranma commit honourable seppuku for failing to fulfill their agreement. This knowledge only added credence to what she had learnt the day before.<p>Turning a corner she was so lost in thought she bumped into someone walking the other way. Nodoka stumbled and would have fallen to the ground if the other hadn't caught her in his arms.<p>"Thank you very much sir, my apologies for bumping into you," Nodoka said, looking up at the handsome man who had caught her.<p>*** Warning, from this point on events shall be seen from a certain Point of View ***<p>Tatewaki Kuno had been deep in thought, not something uncommon for an intellectual such as himself, when some miserable wretch rudely bumped into his most righteous self.<p>The young Samurai Kuno spared a passing glance, a very noble and charitable glance, down at the poor fool who had impudently dared to violate his presence with such impunity.<p>He saw a beautiful, if older, woman who was obviously going to fall after rebounding from his iron hard chest. By her poise and grace she was obviously samurai, much like himself, and the object she carried in that silk case must be a katana the noblest of weapons a design of which his own bokken was based off of.<p>To prevent the woman from falling, Kuno reached out and surrounded her body in his arms, capturing the lady in strong arms belonging to his noble self and supporting her with but a small part of his infinite skill.<p>The woman looked up into his most handsome face, obviously reveling in being held by such a noble man such as himself.<p>"Thank you very much sir, my apologies for bumping into you," the noblewoman thanked him, obviously such a noble lady such as her was made of sterner stuff than the other girls he had met, none but the fair Akane Tendo and her mercenary sister Nabiki Tendo, Kuno shuddered as he realized that Nabiki was his fiancée, had been able to be in his magnanimous presence without being too overawed to speak with him.<p>*** Now we're going to take off the Kuno coloured glasses and proceed as a normal person ***<p>"Not at all, it was my most perfect pleasure to assist one such as yourself noble swordswoman," Kuno replied.<p>It took Nodoka a moment to realize that this young man was speaking about the Saotome honour blade, which she had strapped onto her back. It only took another moment to realize that this young boy was a very traditional person just like herself. The hakama and bokken, which he was wearing, did a fairly good job off implying this, as it also implied that he was proficient in kendo. She imagined he must be from at least a minor noble family with the way he held himself and dressed.<p>Stepping out of the boy's arms she took a step back and bowed in thanks.<p>"Thank you good sir for your assistance," Nodoka thanked the young man.<p>"Not at all, it was most fortuitous of myself happening upon this location as I was able to save one such as yourself from a most unpleasant descent to the unyielding earth," Kuno boisterously spouted, "yet nothing less could be expected from one such as myself."<p>"Once again my thanks, but I must be on my way."<p>"Truly, where do you head most noble swordswoman, surely I Tatewaki Kuno might escort you to your location as to ensure your safety upon these dangerous streets, who knows what ruffians might attempt to accost you."<p>Nodoka stared at the young boy for a moment, he didn't seem to be meaning her any harm although he had a very strange method of diction. Of course if the young man did intend her harm the Kendoist would be in for a very large surprise. She wasn't as helpless as she looked.<p>"I wouldn't want to impose upon your time, there must be many other items requiring your attention."<p>"Not at all, a Kuno knows full well where his duties lie and mine lay with escorting you to whatever destination awaits."<p>It was obvious that this Kuno was going to be very insistent on this subject; Nodoka wouldn't have been surprised if he happened to be a very obsessive person.<p>"Thank you, I would be honoured to have you as an escort," she finally relented and allowed his presence.<p>"And where might it be that a noble lady such as yourself is going," Kuno inquired as he escorted the Saotome matriarch down the streets.<p>"I am on my way to the Tendo Dojo to see someone," Nodoka replied.<p>"Ahh then surely you go to see my fierce tigress," Kuno declared.<p>"Excuse me," Nodoka asked, somewhat startled. This young man had better be talking about one of Tendo's daughters otherwise her son would have some explaining to do while he consecrated his tanto.<p>"The fair Akane Tendo, a beauteous creature trapped into a marriage she doesn't want by that foul sorcerer Saotome, an enemy to womankind. Cheating and fleeing from battle, surely he is no man," Kuno loudly declared, but not too loudly, one never knew where Nabiki's ears were at any given moment in time, saying something like what he usually did could get Kuno in trouble.<p>"You wouldn't happen to mean Ranma Saotome would you," Nodoka asked.<p>"Surely that is the sorcerer's name, he has escaped the vengeance of heaven for far too long. Using his dark magic he has ensnared Akane Tendo to satiate his dark lusts and has forced her mercenary sister and I together. For his folly he shall pay his dues," Kuno continued to rant.<p>Nodoka was now smiling slightly; maybe her son was manlier than she thought. If Akane Tendo and him were engaged and Ranma had already managed to seduce her, then maybe her son was manly enough after all. Even if she wasn't his fiancée that would prove he was manly enough to get himself a good mistress. Nodoka practically glowed with joy.<p>Kuno's comments about Ranma fleeing from battle went right by Nodoka as she focused on Ranma's womanizing, not a bad thing from her point of view.<p>"Would you mind showing me the way to the Tendo Dojo in that case," Nodoka asked, halting Kuno in his ramblings on the evils of sorcerers and their dark magic.<p>"Of course noble lady, we are almost upon the residence of the Tendo family and the vile Saotome," Kuno said taking off at a brisk stride.<p>Nodoka fell into step a pace behind him and thought upon this recent revelation of hers. It appeared her son was a coward when it came to fighting, very unmanly, but at the same time he was already seducing women with success, very manly. She would have to meet her son before she could make any decision on the subject. It wouldn't do to end the entire Saotome line without having all the information first.<p>After all, even the condemned had the right to have their fair say.<p>Kuno halted abruptly and turned to face the Nodoka.<p>"Well here we are good madam, please for your own safety reconsider, it would be ill done and much to my shame should the sorcerer cast a spell upon you as he has so many other women who encounter him. Beware his dark magic and deceitful heart," Kuno seriously warned Nodoka.<p>"Oh I don't think I have anything to fear, after all I am his mother," Nodoka replied as she entered the gates, leaving a gaping Kuno behind her.<p>All Kuno could do was stare at the gates where the woman who had first appeared so noble entered. How could such a demon spawn as Ranma Saotome be born from such a perfect being. Kuno spun round and headed for his mansion to contemplate this matter.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flash forwards, Tendo house, Evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"I don't know who told you that Ranma isn't manly, but whoever they are they must be people who dislike Ranma, you can't listen to what other people say before you even meet him," Akane crossly told Nodoka. Only Ranma's presence had kept the volatile girl from saying anything else to her fiancée's mother.<p>"Maybe, but the young men were all quite manly," Nodoka argued.<p>"Then isn't one measure of a man the quality of his enemies," Akane questioned.<p>The older woman nodded giving in to her future daughter-in-law's point.<p>Unfortunately for the couple Nodoka wasn't assured yet of her son's manliness and she moved in for the kill.<p>"Another judge of a person's manliness is how well he satisfies his fiancée. So tell me Akane-chan, how is my son in bed, does he perform adequately."<p>Akane blushed scarlet and Ranma spat out the tea he was drinking when they heard such crude words coming from such a refined lady's mouth. Neither martial artist could think of words to reply to such a crass question.<p>Once again fortune wasn't with the two as Nodoka took their silence the wrong way.<p>"I take it my son hasn't been performing his duties adequately," Nodoka stated, her eyes narrowing dangerously, "I would have expected Genma to have trained you better." Nodoka sounded disappointed.<p>"How was he meant to train me better," Ranma incredulously asked, managing to find his voice through the astonishment.<p>"Well I'm sure there were plenty of girls on your trip who could have helped you, if not that there are plenty of houses and places for that type of thing," Nodoka stated this as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.<p>Ranma could only stare in disbelief before shuddering at a memory of the time his father had tried to take him to one such type of teahouse with Happosai and Soun. Thanks to the ever-present joy and help of a certain water-based curse Ranma had arrived as a girl.<p>After one individual had gotten a little too friendly, AKA some drunk had groped him, Ranma had lost his fraying temper. In the resulting fight the place was torn apart.<p>The only good thing that had come from the whole situation was Ranma later meeting the gender-challenged ninja Konatsu who came for revenge, but began working for Ranma's best friend Ukyo after he was helped out in escaping the grasp of his jealous female relatives.<p>"Pop never took me to any place like that," Ranma firmly stated, knowing this would be seen as unmanly by his mother, but not wanting to lie to her.<p>A small frown creased Nodoka's face at her son's words; maybe he wasn't as manly in that area as she had hoped, this revelation wasn't helping her impression of him, especially coupled with what all the others had said about him.<p>"Oh Ranma-kun, how is the meeting with your mother going," asked Kasumi from the doorway as she entered the room with a duster and began cleaning.<p>"It's going quite well," Nodoka replied for her son, albeit with a somewhat forced smile.<p>"Well my son, what have you been up to these last several years?"<p>Glad to discuss something besides the looming promise of ritual suicide Ranma was more than happy to enter into this topic.<p>"Well, pop took me away on the training trip and began teaching me martial arts," Ranma began to tell his mother all about the training trip he and his father went on. He left out certain details such as the multiple fiancées, stealing food, the Neko-ken training and the subsequent dump into a pit of cats wrapped in various fish products.<p>During the slightly edited and abridged story Ranma was telling, Akane sat by his side giving his hand the occasional reassuring squeeze.<p>Nodoka sat listening to the story her son told her. Some parts were good, some were bad, and the worst parts Ranma left out to spare his mother and Akane, who hadn't even heard some of the things his father had put him through, and if Ranma had his way neither of them would ever here of them. Ranma didn't particularly like his father, but neither did he want his father dead, which considering some of the things Genma had done would be more than likely.<p>Unnervingly Nodoka showed no real signs of emotion as Ranma told his story; she just sat there impassively listening to what Ranma had to say. This disturbed Akane since some of the details in Ranma's story were truly horrifying and she herself was barely able to constrain the urge to go find a certain panda-man and make herself a very nice panda skin rug, although she did admit to herself that while she wouldn't have any trouble skinning the panda, she would need Kasumi to actually make the rug.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Osaka, Japan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Shampoo looked around satisfied, while that first perverted Japanese nature spirit had been able to sneak up on her, she was sure that it would be the last one that would get a free peep at her.<p>The Amazon champion carefully made her way back to her campsite, avoiding the traps and wards she had put up. She knew she should probably be going after that girl Ranma now, but she wanted one more day to train before she went after the fleeing girl, besides if she was right then the girl would be staying in Japan and not fleeing to another country like she had done from China. A day more wouldn't matter after such a long chase.<p>Shampoo hoped over the trip wire, which would set off the huge swinging logs she had set up. While twisting to avoid the garrotte which would choke anyone who tried to jump the trap. Both log had a spirit ward on it to smash any perverted spirits, which happened to stumble upon it. Teach them to spy on a defenceless girl.<p>Shampoo made her way back to where her sleeping roll was, dodging various traps, trips, pits, spikes, and other defences on her way.<p>Spending a day making non-lethal, lethal, and just plain sadistic traps is enough to tire even an Amazon champion out.<p>Arriving back at her bedroll the Amazon hunter put some more fuel on her fire and began to stretch out any kinks and sore spots before she went to sleep, after all it would do her no good to wake up and barely be able to move.<p>She had just lain down and closed her eyes when a sound from just outside the clearing attracted her attention. Shampoo was up, wide-awake, and in a fighting stance with her bonbori in hand.<p>"Who there," Shampoo asked in her broken Japanese as her eyes glided over the edge of her campsite at the limit of the light her campfire. She couldn't see anything, but she knew someone or something was out there and that he, she, or it was somewhere out there watching her.<p>Shampoo spun around to see a figure move out of the woods behind her.<p>"Aiya, What you doing here?"<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo House, Late Evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"And so after being chased across China by the Chinese Amazon I beat we came here and I met Akane," Ranma finished.<p>His throat had dried out as he was talking and his voice was cracking slightly as the pigtailed martial artist finished telling his mother the abridged and censored version of his training trip. Ranma was glad he hadn't told his fiancée the whole story either. She had almost crushed his hand at certain parts of the story when his father did this or that, such as when Ukyo had been declared as his fiancée by his father for the Okonomiyaki cart and then run off without Ukyo.<p>Akane had stepped out of the room when Ranma had reached the part where Shampoo had begun chasing Ranma across China. She'd heard it many times before and wanted to check and see where and more importantly what, especially in Nabiki's case, the rest of the household was.<p>On her way out of the living room she noticed that the Shogi board was gone. Her father and Mr. Saotome had probably gone bar hopping again so the dumb panda wouldn't have to face his wife and the possibility of having to commit suicide.<p>Nabiki wasn't in her room and Akane couldn't imagine where she would usually go at this time of night except to check on one of her schemes that she had going on. Akane groaned, if Nabiki stayed out too late she wouldn't get much sleep and she'd be grumpy . . . grumpier than she usually was. Akane shrugged it off though, Nabiki was Nabiki, if she didn't have a scheme running it would only be a matter of time before the moon turns blood red and falls from the sky while the seas boil and the four horsemen roam the earth.<p>Akane peeked into the kitchen to see if Kasumi was there. Much to her surprise where once Kasumi stood unchallenged over her domain, excluding Akane's occasional incursions, which more often than not lead to disaster, was an empty room.<p>Curious Akane entered to see if there was any sign of Kasumi. A note on the counter informed her that Kasumi had gone to visit Dr. Tofu and drop off a book.<p>Akane just stared at the note, "Wasn't she meant to ask me to go drop the book off to Dr. Tofu's office tomorrow?"<p>She continued reading; since Mrs. Saotome was here Kasumi had thought it best to leave the three of them alone to talk without interference. Dinner was being kept warm in the oven and that Nabiki had been kind enough to go with Kasumi to visit Dr. Tofu after she had asked.<p>Akane glanced out the window; well at least the moon was still there and a nice white colour.<p>Akane went over to the tap and got some cold water before filling another with hot water from the ever-present kettle.<p>Akane turned to leave the kitchen and took a deep breath, inhaling and exhaling slowly. Now was the hardest part of this entire meeting, thankfully nothing had happened during the meeting to accidentally change Ranma into his female form. Now that Ranma had explained about the training trip, and still had his head attached to his shoulders, they were going to reveal Ranma's curse.<p>Hopefully his mother would accept him as he was, curse and all. If she didn't, well Akane didn't even want to consider that possibility, but they'd work through that obstacle when they came to it.<p>She came back into the room as Ranma was just telling about his arrival to the Tendo Dojo.<p>"So Akane and I met and hit it off, I knew that I would have to choose one of the Tendo daughters to marry and I decided that Akane and I were right for each other and proposed to her in the dojo," Ranma explained to his mother as Akane walked into the room.<p>Nodoka's expression had changed when Ranma told her this from a neutral and impassive visage to a look that said, 'my son is so manly.'<p>Akane saw this and decided to play it up.<p>"That's right, when I met Ranma just a few days ago, he was so manly, handsome, and charming I knew he was the right man for me and I'd love to be married to him and take over the dojo with him," Akane said from the doorway.<p>Nodoka was practically beaming with pride over her manly son being able to get a girl to fall in love with him on their first meeting.<p>Of course neither Ranma nor Akane were going to mention that technically it wasn't their first meeting, but neither felt it would be a good idea to relate that event to Ranma's mother, especially not with the threat of Katana hanging over his neck.<p>Akane took a step forwards to go sit next to her fiancée, but her foot got caught on the doorjamb.<p>The glass of water she held in her hand flew out heading towards Ranma. Akane gasped as she saw the glass heading towards an unaware Ranma.<p>Akane threw the water from the other glass praying that it would hit Ranma fast enough so that Ranma's mother wouldn't notice the change.<p>Ranma heard Akane gasp and turned to see the water heading straight for him. Like a deer caught in headlights, Ranma was frozen in place and unable to move.<p>The glass landed on Ranma's head, emptying its contents onto the pigtailed martial artist. Ranma sat in shock as he felt the warm water running over his head. He breathed a sigh of relief as he realized Akane had let go of the wrong glass.<p>Akane's second gasp snapped Ranma back to reality. His eyes were able to focus on the second stream of water heading straight for him.<p>Why me, I mean honestly what did I ever do to deserve this? Ranma asked himself as the water splashed onto him.<p>She shivered as her body shifted around due to her curse once again trying to ruin the individual known as Ranma Saotome's life.<p>Nodoka looked back from her shamefaced son . . . daughter . . . person who claimed to be her offspring to Akane's horrified expression in shock. What had just happened in front of her?<p>She looked back as Ranma bowed her head low to the table and softly cursed the gods and fate. Akane could only stare at her fiancée with a shocked and horrified expression as her knees gave out and she slumped to the floor leaning against the doorframe.<p>Nodoka's expression hardened as she saw the disgust in her son/daughter's fiancée. Surely Akane could not want the thing her son had become as was obvious by the girl's expression and how she was keeping her distance.<p>Steeling herself for the task at hand, Nodoka decided it was time to judge whether or not Ranma was truly a man amongst men.<p>"Ranma will you please go and fetch the necessary implements. It is time for you to be judged," Tempered steel was nothing compared to Nodoka's voice.<p>Ranma unable to think on his own mechanically stood up and went to get the required objects for what could very well be the end of his re-life.<p>Akane was still slumped against the doorframe in shock over having revealed Ranma's curse inadvertently to his mother without being able to properly warn her.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"That bitch, she is not going to kill the godslayer, I'm going to stop her heart, I'm going to give her a stroke, I'm going to set the furies after her, I'm going to steal one of Zeus' lightning bolts and stuff it down her throat, I'm going to . . ." the armoured figure began to scream at the scene unfolding while stalking back and forth.<p>"Calm down, you know as well as I do that to do such would be to incur Torm's wrath, and that would not be something we would want," the cloaked figure calmly intoned, "besides, there are so many other gods, demons, and beings watching this very scene unfold that there would be no chance of any action being taken go unnoticed. Do you honestly think we are the only entities who wish to do something?"<p>The armoured figure stopped pacing and sat down on its obsidian throne.<p>"I don't have to like it do I?"<p>No response came as they watched the glass slip from Akane's hand and hit Ranma.<p>Both let out a sigh of relief when Ranma didn't change.<p>"I'm sure my heart stopped beating when I saw the water heading for him," the armoured figure muttered.<p>"What heart," asked the cloaked figure impudently?<p>"It's a figure of speech," the armoured figure replied, resting its head in its hands.<p>"Umm, don't look now," the cloaked figure said.<p>"What is it," asked the armoured figure, looking up at the viewing portal.<p>The sight of a dripping wet and very female Ranma was the sight that greeted the armoured figure's eyes.<p>"Oh Hades," both figures exclaimed.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 15, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>AN: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>And quite frankly I'm happy to be done with this. Of the entire story this chapter was by far the most difficult to write and I'm still not completely pleased with it. It has taken a long time to write and has progressed in spurts over a great length of time. The fact that I have also been preparing for midterms and having a pretty hefty work load in class didn't help the speed at which I got this chapter done either. I barely found time to work on the story when I did and that was mostly on weekends. In addition to that I was suffering severe writer's block over just how I was going to address this issue. Thankfully my class workload had lessened slightly and I just went on spring break. This means that I had quite a bit of free time to work on the story and I tried to make up for lost ground over the break. Hopefully my next chapter will not be too far behind this one, but I will no longer be able to throw out a chapter every week.<p>I was very tempted to just leave the story at the part where Ranma's mother cuts off his head, or post the first part of this chapter on April Fools and the rest of the chapter on the second, but I decided I didn't need the outcry of rage, which doing that would elicit so the story continues ever onwards, its inexorable advance slowed, but never truly stopped.<p>I've received quite a few messages from concerned readers over the progress of the story and how long it has been since my last update. Well all those who might have thought I had given up on the story have no fear I persevere and continue my story even in the face of catastrophic troubles and will not stop until I finish, die, or get  look a pretty butterfly. I mean I'll keep working on it as long as I still have people interested in it.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send an e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
