</div>One Last Chance Ch.19<p>**** Is He Strong Enough ****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for the entertainment purposes of both myself and the readers of this story, and I am making no money off it in any way shape or form.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>'Thoughts'<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. A martial arts challenge has been put forth from Ranma and Akane to Mikado and Azusa, which will determine the ownership of Akane's ring. The twist to this is that Ranma and Akane challenged the golden pair to a proper martial arts match and not a martial arts skating match. Upon arriving home the pair received packages from their fathers, which turned out to knock them unconscious. The pair was then rushed to the dojo where Genma and Soun tried to get them married. Due to the timely intervention of Ryoga and Nodoka, Akane and Ranma were able to avoid the marriage attempt. After the day's activities Ranma and Akane were exhausted, falling asleep in the dojo.<p>"There is a massive range of human emotions, and a massive variance in the strength of them. What is the difference between caring and loving besides the stress implied to the word, hatred and dislike, same case? Are hatred and love truly that different. You can love to hate someone or hate yourself for loving someone. Which emotions are negative, which are positive, is lust healthy or damaging?"<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo, morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Wake up Akane-chan, Ranma-kun."<p>A soft, sweet voice cut through the foggy haze of sleep, stirring the two individuals from their sleep.<p>Opening their eyes they saw a smiling Kasumi looking down on them.<p>Blinking a few times Ranma and Akane sat up together, turning their heads and scanning the room, looking for their parents or some other threat.<p>"Good morning, Breakfast will be ready soon," Kasumi stated, turning and walking towards the dojo exit.<p>Glancing down Ranma and Akane realized a few interesting facts.<p>They were both laying on a futon in the dojo.<p>They had covers on over them and a pillow.<p>Akane had been changed into her pajamas and Ranma was in his undershirt and boxers.<p>The couple turned to watch the retreating form of the eldest Tendo daughter as she proceeded out of the dojo.<p>"Oh, if you wouldn't mind, would you please wake your friends and invite them to dinner as well." Kasumi's voice drifted back through the doorway.<p>Ranma and Akane glanced at each other in confusion, before as one looking up.<p>There above them, Hiroshi and Daisuke were still hanging from the ceiling, both asleep.<p>"I'll wake those two up, you go get dressed, I'm sure those two would love to see you in pajamas." Ranma told Akane, causing her to blush slightly.<p>With a mutter of, "perverts," Akane left the dojo heading for the house.<p>Chuckling to himself Ranma stood up slipping into a new pair of clothes, which Kasumi had thoughtfully left for him beside the futon.<p>Ranma used his foot to move the futon right below the two slumbering students.<p>Jumping straight up into the air, Ranma slashed his hand across the rope before landing exactly from where he began.<p>A moment later his classmates joined him on the floor, landing roughly on the futon and jostling Hiroshi and Daisuke awake.<p>"Aww mom, just another half hour please," Daisuke said, trying to roll over.<p>Well maybe not completely awake.<p>"Wakey wakey Daisuke," Ranma singsonged, nudging his friend with his foot, trying to get him to wake up.<p>"Morning Ranma, how are you today, enjoy you're honeymoon?" Hiroshi asked with a lecherous grin.<p>"We didn't get married Hiroshi, we avoided that," Ranma replied, rolling his eyes while his nudges turned into small kicks.<p>"I'm awake, I'm awake," Daisuke finally stated, waking up from a rather pleasant dream.<p>"Well that's good." Ranma commented before turning and walking for the door.<p>"Umm Ranma, do you think you could untie us please?" Daisuke called to Ranma's retreating form.<p>"Fine," Ranma sighed, walking back to the bound pair. Reaching down he snapped the thick lengths of rope with his hands.<p>"Come on you two," Ranma said, dragging Hiroshi and Daisuke to their feet and pushing them towards the house.<p>"Umm, what was that all about last night anyway Ranma, with that whole marriage thing and the woman who said she was your mother?" Daisuke asked.<p>"Yeah she was hot I wouldn't OWWW." Hiroshi yelped, as Ranma bashed him not very gently on the back of his head.<p>"She's my mother don't talk about her that way." Ranma warned his friend.<p>"Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry," Hiroshi said, covering the back of his head with his hands.<p>"So Ranma, what was that all about last night anyway, with that whole marriage thing?" Daisuke asked, leaving out the dangerous question about Ranma's mother this time.<p>Ranma couldn't help but sigh; it was going to be a long day.<p>"Listen, this is the way it is, Akane and I want to get married, just not yet, we want to take it slowly and not rush it," Ranma began to explain hiss and Akane's unique relationship to his schoolmates, leaving out certain obvious details such as dragons, phoenixes, gods, time-travel, and all the insanity to come, this made for a less interesting, but more plausible story.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dining room, Tendo House ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"My daughter and son-in-law have come back," Soun wept freely when Ranma entered the room, "the schools will be joined."<p>Ranma scanned the room, taking note of the occupants; thankfully his parents were still out somewhere else it seemed so he wouldn't have to deal with them.<p>Kasumi had already set most of the table and was even now bringing in the last of the food for breakfast.<p>Nabiki was sitting against a wall appearing to be reading a manga, although whether or not she was actually reading the manga or not was questionable.<p>Soun was sitting at the table with a newspaper crumpled in his hands while he wept openly and spouted out nonsense that Ranma really didn't care to listen too.<p>"As much as things change," Ranma muttered under his breath before leading Hiroshi and Daisuke to the table and pushing them down into sitting positions.<p>Soun's water works ended when he saw the two guests sit down at the table.<p>"Good morning," Soun gruffly greeted before opening up the newspaper and began reading the news, completely ignoring the rest of the room.<p>"Good morning," Akane greeted as she rushed into the room in her school uniform, "Come on Ranma, we've got to get to school."<p>"We don't have school today, remember." Said Daisuke.<p>"We don't, but it's a weekday," Ranma replied slightly confused.<p>"National Samurai and katana appreciation day," Hiroshi corrected Ranma.<p>"You weren't around for him, but Furinkan used to have a real principal, not just the acting principal who is really the vice-principal," Daisuke explained.<p>"He was really strange from what I can remember, but one of the things he did that was good was change Furinkan over to an American school schedule, which was really big considering how obsessed he was with Japanese culture and history, and he instituted a bunch of weird holidays," Hiroshi continued.<p>"Yeah, Honour day, Seppuku day, even gaijin day, and a bunch of other holidays for no reason. Then one year he just upped and left to America leaving nothing but a note saying, 'I will return to this high position of honour when I have learnt the true mastership of teaching.'" Daisuke finished.<p>"He sounded like Kuno," Ranma was genuinely surprised, the only Principal Kuno he knew was the shear wielding, Hawaii-shirt wearing, funny speaking person who came back to Furinkan seemingly just to make his life miserable.<p>"To a point yeah, but from what I heard he lived to make everyone's lives miserable. Of course I'm sure most of it was made up, he left a few years before we were old enough to go to Furinkan so this is mostly hearsay." Hiroshi shrugged.<p>"Then why didn't the vice-principal change it back to a regular schedule and get rid of the holidays?" Ranma asked, he couldn't believe he'd never heard any of this before. It sounded like insanity had come to Nerima and Furinkan before he had arrived. Why had no one ever mentioned it to him before?<p>"Yeah I remember that," chimed in Akane, "Kasumi was the last class who actually had him, we were still in middle school while all that stuff happened. As for the vice-principal, he was happy to have less work and just went along with anything the way it was."<p>"I think he was scared of the old principal coming back." Hiroshi chuckled.<p>"Well since he's been gone so long, I don't think we need to worry about seeing him again before we graduate." Daisuke threw in, eliciting an unseen shudder from Ranma and Akane, who both knew that Daisuke had unwittingly just sealed his own doom.<p>The conversation trickled off as the last of the food was laid out and Kasumi began serving food.<p>Everyone began digging in to Kasumi's delicious cooking.<p>Daisuke and Hiroshi realized that even if it meant being kidnapped and tied up, not that Hiroshi really minded being tied up as long as there was a show like the one last night to go along with it, they needed to come back here to eat Kasumi's cooking.<p>Soon breakfast was over and it was time for Hiroshi and Daisuke to leave. Their parents would be worrying soon.<p>"I'll walk you guys back if you want," Ranma offered his two 'friends'.<p>"Sure Ranma, that'll be fine." Hiroshi said while thinking, 'If Ranma walks home with us maybe something exciting will happen to him and we'll get to watch.'<p>"Yeah Ranma, that's cool." Daisuke said while thinking, 'If Ranma walks home with us maybe if something happens he'll be able to deal with it while Hiroshi and I sneak away.'<p>Ranma could only stare at the strange look and slight smile his two fellow students had in their eyes.<p>"Ummm, okay then, lets go."<p>With that the three of them left, leaving just the Tendo's in the house... all alone.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima, ten minutes later ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"So Ranma, tell us a bit about yourself." Daisuke prompted.<p>"Yeah, what have you been up too in your life before you came to this crazy town?" Hiroshi asked, drawing a knowing smirk from Ranma, which went, unnoticed by his walking companions.<p>"Well when I was about four or five my father took me away from my mother after promising her that if I didn't return as a man among men I would commit seppuku with my father with my mother as our second. After we were dead she would kill herself, thus ending the Saotome line. From there I traveled around Asia with my father who trained me in crazy martial arts techniques on of which took away part of my sanity, while giving me none of the love a growing human requires. In addition to that he taught me no manners and permanently scarred me by filling my head with nonsense about women and anything that wasn't martial arts."<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke were staring at Ranma with a little awe, a little fear, and a lot of disbelief. Ranma was talking in a matter of fact tone without really putting much emotion into the story one-way or the other.<p>"But the best part is yet to come, along the way he soled me to other people as a fiancée for their daughters in exchange for food, sometimes as little as a bowl of rice, a piece of fish, and two pickles. Every single time he stole me back and ran away having never cared about fulfilling the promises he made to any of the others. We traveled to China where he knocked me into a spring where I got a curse, now I live my life in fear of cold water splashing me."<p>Ranma didn't even realize what he had just said, causing Daisuke and Hiroshi to look at him funny.<p>"In addition, while I was in China I got my own personal assassin hunting me down from a backwards warrior tribe in a backwards part of China who wants to kill me because of my curse and if she knew the truth she'd want to marry me."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outskirts of Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"ACCCHHHOOOOO, Aiya, Shampoo hope she not come down with anything"<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Street of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Hiroshi had a feeling Ranma had to be pulling their leg with this bit.<p>"Now I come back to Nerima and get surprised by the fact I now have a fiancée that my father wants me to marry along with a horde of girls who want to marry me and all have technically valid claims to me. I was also told my entire life that my mother was dead, but then am suddenly told about the seppuku clause and find out my mother just might make me go through with it because of my curse. In addition to that the girl who I love and who loves me are being forced into marriage attempts by our fathers before we are ready to be married just because there are not willing to wait."<p>Ranma suddenly turned and punched a telephone pole in anger. Hiroshi and Daisuke stared in amazement as the pigtailed martial artist's fist rather than having every bone in his hand went straight through the pole like out of a movie.<p>A police officer standing ten feet away could only stare before coming to the conclusion that he hadn't seen anything, after all people just didn't put theirs fist through solid steel. In the old Nerima before Ranma died, the officers of Nerima had become very good at looking the other way when an incident like this happened. The fact that the crime rate of Nerima went down exponentially in all areas besides property damage which had increased drastically before flattening out, allowed the police to continue this policy allowing the officers to get back to what they considered to be important, 'Protecting the local doughnut and coffee shops.' So there was no way a kid could do something like that, no need to talk to the kid or file a report, might as well just go get a doughnut.<p>"Umm, what curse Ranma?" Asked Daisuke, trying to ignore the whole superhuman feat Ranma had just performed, after all, he did vanish into thin air last night, so it would make sense that he'd have super human strength.<p>Hiroshi just stood there imaging what would have happened had it been his head and not he light pole. Not a very pleasant picture to be sure.<p>'Woops,' Ranma thought to himself, he hadn't meant to reveal that part to these two, it had just gotten so second nature to accept and talk about his curse that he hadn't thought about the fact nobody but the Tendo's knew about it.<p>"Well you see I just get bad luck that this witch doctor person I went to cursed me or at least said I was cursed." Unfortunately for him, dieing hadn't improved Ranma's ability to lie convincingly, that particular trait went entirely to Genma.<p>"Really," Daisuke deadpanned.<p>"Oh come on, out of all the story that's the only detail you have trouble dealing with?"<p>Hiroshi shrugged, "You're a strange guy Ranma, I think curses are cool, so what is it?"<p>"Yeah come on, tell us," Daisuke prompted.<p>"Listen, it's not important, it's just a minor little thing that doesn't matter," Ranma protested backing away from Hiroshi and Daisuke waving his hands in front of himself defensively.<p>"Come on Ranma, tell us." Daisuke said<p>"Yeah, what's the big deal?" Hiroshi asked.<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke backed Ranma against the fence, crowding him in.<p>Ranma was getting quite nervous; after all it wasn't like he could fight these two. Glancing behind himself Ranma inwardly cursed, he was backed against a rickety fence overlooking a canal.<p>'What's with Nerima and all these waterways?' Ranma internally asked himself<p>Unfortunately a car came along at that moment through a puddle of water that had settled right next too where the three boys were standing. The water from it splashed perfectly to hit the group.<p>"Aww great, now I'm wet." Daisuke complained.<p>"Me too," Hiroshi groused, patting at his wet clothing.<p>"You ok Ranma?" Daisuke asked the pigtailed martial artist.<p>Ranma could only stare in shock at his two friends while trying to slow down his heart. Patting himself in certain places Ranma came to two conclusions. Firstly, he wasn't a female and secondly he was dry. Ranma stared at Hiroshi and Daisuke, they had acted as a shield and all the water had splashed on them and not him.<p>"Damn, let's get to my house and change out of these clothes." Hiroshi sighed as he began trudging towards his home.<p>"Ok, I think I still have some clothes over at your place." Daisuke agreed.<p>The two began walking towards their house at a faster pace.<p>"We can get home from here Ranma, thanks for walking us this far." Hiroshi thanked Ranma.<p>"Yeah man, we'll see you at school." Daisuke agreed, just wanting to get out of the wet clothes he was wearing.<p>"Bye," was all Ranma could bring himself to say.<p>"I didn't get hit by the water." Ranma still shocked said.<p>"I didn't get hit by the water." A smile formed on Ranma's face<p>"I DIDN'T GET HIT BY THE WATER." Ranma happily yelled.<p>A moment later a car came by, hitting the puddle of water. In hind thought, Ranma realized she should have moved away from such a large puddle.<p>So with a sigh Ranma began trudging home.<p>"What else do you have for me today?" Ranma asked the heavens.<p>The heavens responded.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo house, a few minutes later ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Oh my, it seems to be raining," Kasumi commented as she entered the living room with some tea and cookies, "the weather report said it was going to be a bright sunny day."<p>"Looks like it's clearing up already," Nabiki commented.<p>"I hope Ranma's ok." Akane said looking out onto the once raining backyard.<p>"Don't worry about that ungrateful boy, he'll be fine," Genma replied eyeing the plate of cookies with a lust that would probably make Nodoka jealous is she was around.<p>"Oh you make your poor old father so happy showing such concern for your dear fiancé, we should have a wedd" * GRRRRRRRR * "ing." Soun and the rest of the room stared in shock at Akane.<p>Akane could only blink, she hadn't meant to growl like that, it had just come out when her father began butting in on her and Ranma again, forcing them into a marriage too soon.<p>"Excuse me," Akane said, rushing out of the room and up the stairs leaving the rest of the family to watch her exit.<p>"Oh my," was the only sound that followed her out of the room.<p>"Tendo, your daughters are strange."<p>"She didn't used to be like this before her dear mother died, WAAAAAAAAH."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>* Splash *<p>"AHHHH, that feels so much better." Ranma said to himself, completely ignoring the stupefied look of the shopkeeper and the other patrons in the restaurant.<p>"Thank you," Ranma said, handing the empty teacup back to the shopkeeper who was only able to take it out of reflex.<p>Geez you'd think these people had never seen a martial artist with a curse before. Ranma thought to himself as he walked out of the store and down the street, ignoring the bewildered stares that followed him out of the restaurant.<p>A few steps later his danger sense went off from an impending threat. As Ranma extended his senses time seemed to slow around him as the martial artist felt out his area.<p>Ranma wasn't able to keep a smirk from entering his face as he sensed the descending threat. Whoever it was, although he could make a guess, had put themselves into a high jump that would take them several seconds to reach the ground from the apex.<p>Ranma calmly stopped walking and waited for his latest assailant to land.<p>Ryoga came down umbrella first landing right on top of where Ranma was, had he not stopped walking.<p>"Damn it Ranma, first you run away from our fight and now you hide from me." Ryoga cursed.<p>"Hey P-Chan," Ranma greeted, standing not five feet behind the fanged lost boy.<p>"P-Chan?" Ryoga asked in confusion, turning around to face his nemesis.<p>Ranma internally winced again; he had forgotten that Ryoga hadn't even heard that name yet. He really had to remember to watch his words more often.<p>"Never mind that," Ryoga yelled, dismissing the issue as Ranma attempting to mislead him and distract him long enough to escape from Ryoga's hard earned vengeance. "I'm here to pay you back for what has happened to me."<p>"And what would that be Ryoga," Ranma asked a hint of anger entering his voice.<p>"Ranma Saotome, thanks to you I've," Ryoga began.<p>"You've seen hell, I know, I know, you've said it before and I'm sure you're going to say it again." Ranma interrupted. "So what are you going to do about it?"<p>Ryoga's blood began to boil; during his life Ryoga had always had a short fuse. He had never had many friends during his life as his prodigious strength made many people afraid of him. They wouldn't even talk to him, and then he had come, Ranma Saotome.<p>Ranma Saotome, he had made Ryoga more of an outcast, the pigtailed martial artist had belittled him and humiliated him in front of all the others. Had his nemesis stayed, Ryoga was sure that after he had beaten Ranma Saotome all the other boys would be is friends and they wouldn't mock him.<p>This hadn't happened either, Ranma had run off and people had ridiculed him, no one listened to his side of the story fairly, they had mocked him, until finally Ryoga couldn't take it and he had gone to finish his fight with the person who made everyone dislike him and had ruined his life.<p>Then Jusenkyo happened.<p>"Ranma for what you've put me through I will not stop until I have destroyed your happiness."<p>"You might as well tell me what I did before you attack me Ryoga otherwise I wouldn't know what your reasons are."<p>"Revenge is a good enough reason for your final moments." Ryoga yelled, charging with his fist cocked back for a devastating punch.<p>Ranma just stared there in shock at Ryoga telegraphing his move so obviously that he almost forgot to dodge, allowing Ryoga's fist to come within centimeters of his face.<p>Ryoga internally cheered, Ranma wasn't so tough as he had expected if he could barely dodge such an obvious punch, oh well Revenge was revenge no matter how sweet.<p>Ryoga opened up with a combination of simple punches that would crush anybody.<p>Ranma merely stepped in between the punches, arriving a few inches in front of Ryoga's nose.<p>"Not bad for a beginner," Ranma mocked Ryoga while weaving effortlessly through the lost boy's punches.<p>"Damn you Ranma, stand still and take your beating like a man," Ryoga cursed, becoming frustrated by how his punches met with nothing but afterimages and air.<p>"Fine Ryoga, I will," Ranma replied, stopping his dodging and standing a meter or two away from the fanged martial artist.<p>So surprised was he by his foes compliance, Ryoga just stood there for a moment, his fist still extended from where the last of Ranma's afterimages used to be.<p>"Fine, if you won't do anything I will pork chops," Ranma called out before rushing forwards and slamming his fist into Ryoga's chest<p>"Is that what you wanted Ryoga?" Ranma asked haughtily.<p>Ryoga stared at him wide eyed.<p>Ranma stared back, waiting for Ryoga to bellow at him and attack or criticize how weak his punch had been.<p>The pigtailed martial artist was not ready for Ryoga to start coughing. Blood came from Ryoga's mouth with the coughs as Ryoga sunk down on his knees before fainting.<p>Ranma stared at the lost boy lying unconscious on the ground and then to his fist, back to his injured rival.<p>Not wasting anymore time, Ranma hoisted Ryoga's pack onto his shoulders before carefully scooping up the lost boy in his arms and running for Doctor Tofu's clinic as fast as his legs would carry his cargo and himself.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A few minutes later, Tofu's Clinic ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Tofu was sitting quietly reading a book and enjoying a cup of tea. He didn't have any more appointments today and was relaxing, allowing his mind to focus on the task at hand. He had just bought an extremely valuable book and was studying it intently learning its secrets and making them his own.<p>'No more appointments today,' Tofu mentally repeated for the umpteenth time since starting the book, 'unless there's an emergency I can get on with my studies.'<p>A large crash in the other room made Tofu's head jerk up to stare at the wall as if it were a window instead.<p>"Dr Tofu, we need your help, Ryoga's hurt bad." Ranma voices came through the wall.<p>Giving himself a rueful smile Tofu made his way towards the reception area.<p>"Speak of the devil," Tofu mumbled to himself, and then paused as a cold shudder ran down his spine.<p>Entering the reception area Tofu saw Akane's new fiancée standing there carrying an enormous backpack and an unconscious youth.<p>All humour pushed was pushed aside when Tofu saw the blood on the stranger's lips.<p>"Please carry him into the other room Ranma." Tofu instructed the pigtailed teenager, while leading the way himself.<p>Ranma obediently followed.<p>"Please put him down there," Tofu instructed, pointing to a bed in the room.<p>Ranma gently lowered Ryoga onto the indicated bed and took a step back allowing Tofu to step close and examine his wounded rival.<p>Passing his hand over Ryoga with a feather's softness Tofu examined the unconscious boy, marveling at the surprising strength of the individual who was obviously a martial artist, but doing a double take of the elongated canines before ruling the teeth as irrelevant.<p>"Four of his ribs are broken," Tofu stated allowed, more for Ranma's benefit than his own, "shouldn't be too hard to fix." Tofu reached down, placing his hands on Ryoga's chest.<p>The following snapping sounds made Ranma go a little pale. 'A human body shouldn't make those sounds.' He thought to himself while watching in morbid fascination, unable to tear his eyes away from the sight.<p>Tofu pulled out a needle with something in it and put it into Ryoga's arm injecting the liquid into the unconscious lost boy.<p>"Don't worry it's just something to help him sleep," Tofu told Ranma seeing the worried look on the young man's face.<p>A few moments later, Tofu looked up smiling before stepping away from the bed and turning to face Ranma.<p>"Your friend will be fine, he just needs several weeks to heal and he should be good as new."<p>Ranma had a feeling Ryoga would take less time than that, but there was no point in saying so.<p>"I almost killed him didn't I?" Ranma asked, his facial expression and tone unreadable.<p>"Not quite," Doctor Tofu stated, trying to assuage some of Ranma's guilt, "Had he not received proper medical attention and had he been hit in the chest again, then yes it would have been very serious and maybe fatal, but that is neither here nor there so let's not worry about that."<p>Tofu's reassuring words and manner relieved Ranma fears causing him to let out a sigh of relief.<p>"Now Ranma, why don't you tell me who this is and what happened to him?" Tofu asked, leading Ranma out of the room and into his office. Once into the office, he gently pushed Ranma down into a chair and went to make some tea for the two of them.<p>Ranma sat down in the chair and just stared at the doctor's back, trying to think of what he was going to say.<p>"Ranma...Ranma." Doctor Tofu's voice jolted Ranma out of his thoughts.<p>"Here you are Ranma," the doctor said, placing a warm glass of tea into the pigtailed boy's hands.<p>"Thanks doc," Ranma replied, sipping on his tea.<p>"Now Ranma, why don't you tell me who that young man is and what happened to him?"<p>"That's Ryoga, I knew him a when we were both kids in school."<p>Ranma paused to sip his tea again, Tofu just sat watching him, wary of giving any more prompting.<p>"We'd always fight over stuff and practice against each other," another sip, "well before pops dragged me away we were scheduled to fight."<p>"And you weren't able to show up?"<p>"Nah, just the opposite. I showed up and waited for three days before pop dragged me away after I passed out."<p>"So he forfeited," Tofu stated.<p>"Well he doesn't see it that way, he got lost and when he arrived on the fourth day ready to fight I was gone."<p>"Where was this place that took him four days to get too?" Asked the doctor.<p>"It was the empty lot behind his house, maybe fifteen meters away from his front door."<p>Tofu could only stare in shock.<p>"Well I haven't seen him for years until just the other day when he showed up and swore vengeance against me."<p>"Why would he do that?"<p>"Oh, he has a Jusenkyo curse that he blames me for giving to him."<p>Tofu knew Ranma was leading up to something, but he felt the need to ask another question.<p>"Did you give him the curse Ranma?"<p>The pigtailed martial artist squirmed slightly under Tofu's gaze.<p>"Sort of, I was chasing pops and didn't see him and accidentally knocked him into the cursed springs, but he doesn't know it was me." Ranma hastily added causing the doctor to raise a questioning eyebrow.<p>"What do you mean by that?"<p>"Well pop and I were cursed at the time and I didn't know I could change back so I was chasing him and must have bumped Ryoga, so he didn't know it was me. He just blames me since he was following me."<p>The door burst open, knocking the door out of the frame sending it crashing to the door.<p>"Ranma, I knew it was you, because of you I've seen hell, prepare to die."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A few minutes ago, Tofu's clinic ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>'Uggh, I feel like I've been hit by a train.' Ryoga thought to himself. He groggily pushed back the black clouds of sleep, trying to regain consciousness.<p>His ribs ached and his chest felt like he had stood in the way of a wrecking ball.<p>'Actually that wrecking ball hurt less than this did.' Ryoga joked to himself, using his elbows to push himself up to a sitting position.<p>He shook his head trying to clear more of the clouds from his mind. Using one of his hands, he probed around his head for any injury. There were none, but then why did he feel so groggy.<p>Sliding his legs off the edge of the bed he tried to stand up. He had to catch himself before he fell. His legs were weak and felt like jelly, if the fanged boy hadn't grabbed onto the bed's edge he would have fallen on his face.<p>Ryoga made his way to a sink close to the door.<p>'Maybe a drink of water will clear my head.' He thought, slowly making his way across the room to the sink.<p>Putting his head under the sink he ran WARM water over his head and filled a glass with cold water, making sure not to spill any of the cool liquid, as it would inevitably find its way onto his own body and trigger his curse.<p>Most of the clouds had cleared from his head so Ryoga began looking around for some sign of where he was. To most people waking up in a strange location and not knowing where they are would be a strange and frightening experience. To Ryoga, this was an everyday occurrence and no cause for worry.<p>'Where am I now, last thing I remember was fighting with Ranma and then he hit me and now I'm here, did he hurt me that badly?'<p>There were two people talking very close in just another room or two over. Leaning on the wall he made his way through what must have been a doctors clinic towards the voices, maybe they could tell him where he was and what had happened. With any luck he would still be in Tokyo and could find Ranma again quickly.<p>"Sort of, I was chasing pops and didn't see him and accidentally knocked him into the cursed springs, but he doesn't know it was me."<p>Ryoga heard Ranma's words and began to get angrier and angrier.<p>'That Bastard, he gave this curse to me and he never told me. It's Ranma's fault I turn into a little pork dinner. Ranma...Ranma...RANMA. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.' Ryoga screamed inside his own head.<p>Ryoga stared at the door containing the cause of all of his problems. If he could just kill the person beyond that door it would all be better.<p>Ryoga charged the door, slamming it open and stepping into the room.<p>"Ranma, I knew it was you, because of you I've seen hell, prepare to die." The lost boy bellowed at his shocked nemesis.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Now ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>The enraged Ryoga lunged for Ranma preparing to kill him, when he fell limp to the floor.<p>Tofu pulled his arm back from the shiatsu point he hit on the back of Ryoga's neck.<p>"I didn't expect him to be up and about so soon, that tranquilizer should have kept him out for a lot longer than he was. I can't believe he's up and about so quickly." Tofu calmly stated as he check the unconscious lost boy to see if his injuries had been aggravated by his latest activity.<p>"Give me a hand with him will you Ranma?" Tofu kindly requested.<p>"Umm sure thing doc." Ranma said helping Doctor Tofu lift the unconscious lost boy of the floor where he was sleeping peacefully and carry him into the clinic area again.<p>"The sedative I gave him would have knocked out a large man for hours."<p>Through heavy lidded eyes Ranma looked at Tofu and asked, "Got any horse tranquilizers."<p>Tofu only stared at the young martial artist in shock before realizing Ranma wasn't joking.<p>"I'll take care of him Ranma, I think you can go."<p>Ranma nodded to Tofu and said his farewells before leaving the clinic.<p>"Are you going to be okay walking home Ranma?" Tofu asked as a reflex.<p>"Yeah doc, I think I'll be fine. I don't think anyone will mess with me." Ranma replied with a grin. He almost wished someone would try to mug him.<p>Ranma stepped outside and started walking to the gate when he felt droplets of water on his head. Before he could even blink the light drizzle had turned into heavy rain.<p>"Well, what I meant," came Dr. Tofu's voice drifting out into the rain, "Was that the weather report said sporadic showers."<p>Ranma merely glanced towards the heavens, rattled off a string of expletives, and began walking home ignoring the downpour.<p>"What I don't understand," Ranma said to himself, "is how I hit Ryoga so many times, I meant to only throw one punch, but I'm pretty sure I did more than that."<p>Ranma began rubbing the offending fist, not noticing the red that danced across the surface of the ruby in his ring before fading out.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo, same time ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Akane did your ring just glow?" Nabiki asked her sister.<p>"I don't think so, why do you ask?" Akane replied, looking down at the ring on her finger.<p>"I could have sworn that I saw a blue glow streak across it." Nabiki had been reading and just happened to look up when a glint from Akane's ring caught her eye.<p>"Nonsense Nabiki, it was probably just a trick of the light." Akane argued.<p>"You're probably right Akane," Nabiki allowed, "just a trick of the light."<p>Akane looked at the ring on her finger, staring into the sapphire. As she stared into the precious stone, a feeling of warmth and comfort flowed through her making Akane smile blissfully.<p>A minute or two later, Nabiki just turned away with a shrug thinking, 'I'll never understand love. Now how do I get a satisfactory resolution to this whole Kuno situation.'<p>Nabiki went back to looking over the engagement contract that her father and Kuno had signed, there had to be a loophole in there somewhere she could use, she just had to find it first.<p>There had to be.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"What a day, walked Hiroshi and Daisuke home, almost killed Ryoga, and now I got caught in a freak rain shower, which ended almost as soon as it started, then some weird guys with flowers on there head attack me for desecrating their holy flower pot and now I'm covered in potting soil and there isn't even any rain to wash me off." Ranma groused to the heavens.<p>Ranma was walking back towards the Tendo dojo, what had started out a nice day, waking up in the arms of the woman he loved always counted as a good start, had turned into a pretty normal day in Nerima, except for the amount of damage done to Ryoga over normal. So for all his grumbling and complaining he wasn't that unhappy and had a smile on his face. He didn't even hurt the creep who started hitting on his girl form as he walked home, just ignored him and jumped onto the roof of a nearby building startling the man who had been hitting on him into a stupor.<p>"RANMA, YOU I KILL."<p>Ranma leapt straight up in the air, avoiding the throwing daggers, which embedded themselves into the roof where he had been standing.<p>The purple haired Amazon landed on the roof, drawing her bonbori and getting into a stance to face Ranma where he landed.<p>"Nihao Shampoo," Ranma said in greeting with a cheerful smile on her face as he greeted 'her' amazon pursuer, enjoying the surprised look on her face.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima, a few moments ago ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>There was her target, she had been searching most of the day, only taking cover from a cloudburst that poured down a huge deluge of water which had ended almost immediately afterwards, and now she had found the one who had run for so long and gotten so far away from the village and the disastrous battle one the challenge log.<p>Now she just had to wait for the right moment to make her move. When the red-haired girl jumped onto the roof from the street, Shampoo knew now was her chance.<p>"RANMA, YOU I KILL!" She yelled out, giving her prey as honour demanded a chance to defend herself.<p>Pulling a set of throwing daggers from her sleeves she hurled them at her prey's feet. As she expected, the steel only hit the ground as Ranma dodged the thrown blades.<p>"Nihao, Shampoo," Ranma greeted with a cheerful smile on her face, Shampoo wasn't distracted in the slightest although to any observer the shocked look she showed on her face would have made them think otherwise. She stalked towards him casually and carefully as she approached.<p>Tensing the muscles in her legs ever so slightly she moved forwards with a smile, "Nihao Ranma."<p>This move caught the red haired girl unawares and put her off balance long enough to make her move.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ranma POV, same time ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>It was obvious to anyone, even Ranma, that greeting Shampoo like he did had thrown her balance off. She even stumbled a few steps closer to him than before.<p>Then too Ranma's surprise the Amazon stood up straight, put a smile on her face and said, "Nihao Ranma."<p>Ranma in all honesty was caught off guard and nearly stumbled forwards. 'What, why isn't she attacking me' the pigtailed martial artist asked himself.<p>Without warning Shampoo charged forwards executing a secret Amazon technique from which there was no escape.<p>* GLOMP *<p>Ranma looked down on himself to see the lavender haired girl's arms tight around him and her head resting below his chin having completed a perfect Amazon glomp.<p>"Umm, excuse me, but what are you doing."<p>The Amazon in his arms looked up in surprise.<p>"Wo Ai Ni, Wo Da Airen." She then proceeded to give Ranma a very passionate kiss taking advantage of his open mouth to slip in a little tongue.<p>"!"<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo, same time ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Akane Tendo gasped and bolted upright into a standing position from where she was sitting in the living room, startling her family and Mr. Saotome.<p>Akane looked at the four expectant faces staring up at her from where they had been sitting.<p>"Ranma's in trouble." Was all the youngest Tendo said before running out of the room. A few seconds later the front door was heard opening and closing.<p>Soun and Genma were the next to stand up. Gripping hands in a hearty handclasp they stared into each other's eyes a growing fire burning within each of their orbs.<p>"You know what we must do Saotome," asked the Tendo patriarch.<p>"Yes I do old friend," replied the Saotome patriarch.<p>"My daughter cares so much for her fiancée."<p>"The schools will be joined."<p>Their resolve affirmed, the two older martial artists made their way towards the sake cabinet.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Rooftops of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Stay away from me Shampoo," Ranma yelled, leaping from one rooftop to another.<p>"Wo Ai Ni," came Shampoo's reply as she followed him over the rooftops.<p>A sudden rise in Ranma's danger sense caused him to leap backwards immediately after landing. Barely avoiding a group of shurikens which imbedded themselves into the roof where he was and would have been had he tried to dodge forwards.<p>Ranma dropped into a low crouch stance, spreading his senses out searching for his attacker. Shampoo had not thrown those shurikens at him; they had to have come from a different direction than where she was standing. Unless the purple-haired Amazon knew a secret technique she had never shown him in the past, the blades had to have come from someone else.<p>Unfortunately for him Shampoo merely wanted to cuddle, not attack him, as such he failed to note the rapidly approaching Amazon until she was on top of him, literally.<p>"Well done son-in-law, you dodged those blades masterfully." Came a familiar voice from behind him.<p>Turning Ranma came face to face with someone he would have preferred to have viewed from a distance.<p>"AHHHH, an old Ghoul," He yelled, back pedaling away from the Amazon elder with Shampoo still wrapped around him. Coincidentally it also took him out of striking range of her staff.<p>"Be more respectful to your elders boy." Cologne snapped, mentally reminding herself to give him an extra hard rap of her staff the next time the opportunity presented itself.<p>"Fine then, who are you, what are you doing here, what do you want, and what do you mean son-in-law?" Ranma asked.<p>"You beat my great-granddaughter in combat and now as per our ancient and glorious laws you are married to her." Cologne replied to the young man before her.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flashback, several days ago, Amazon Village ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Cologne jerked upright to find herself sitting in her bed, looking around for some sign of what had disturbed her from her dream. She had the feeling of a great sense of wrongness coming from somewhere, but she had no idea where it was or even what was causing it.<p>Reaching to her neck she felt for the soul stone, which she had sealed Happosai into after the deaths of son in law and the Tendo girl various parties had crippled and damaged the old pervert beyond repair she had taken his soul and imprisoned it within the crystal. This was a punishment reserved for only the worst criminals. Even then it usually took the council a long time, almost a month in the shortest trials to agree on using this punishment. When cologne returned to the village she was fully prepared to defend her case before the council. Of course when she told the council who she had inflicted the punishment upon, the council merely shrugged their shoulders in acceptance while Fa-shen, a healer and the most pacifistic individual on the council, had said, "Couldn't of happened to a worse person."<p>There had been no punishment for her hasty decision.<p>The stone wasn't there, Cologne looked around her bed to see if it might have fallen off while she slept although that was extremely unlikely.<p>Unable to find it, she left her room moving into the common area of the hut she shared with her grand son and her great grand daughter she immediately noticed that there were things wrong with it. Nothing overly noticeable at first, but small things, such as the chair shampoo broke over Mousse's head a week ago was still whole and undamaged, the wall Shampoo threw mousse through a few days ago had no patching in it, the bump in the table where shampoo beat him down with, or ... As a matter of fact just about everything Shampoo had so recently hit Mousse with was whole again or undamaged.<p>"Good morning Grandmother, are you ok today," Shampoo's father politely asked having seen the disturbed look upon the old woman's face.<p>"Yes I'm fine thank you, where is Xian pu today," Cologne asked, it was rare although not unheard of for her great granddaughter to get up earlier than herself.<p>"Why she is still chasing after that red haired outsider that beat her in the tournament a few weeks ago. From her last letter Xian pu reported that she was crossing the sea which separates us from the land of the Rising Sun and would continue tracking her there?" He knew that Cologne had read that most recent letter before he had; in fact he hadn't been allowed to read any of his daughters letters before his grandmother had looked them over.<p>"Oh No," and those were the last words he heard from her mouth before she shot out the door.<p>The sentries saw her leaving the village less than an hour later all that she said to the council was that she had to go on a little trip for an indefinite period of time and that she would return. At the conclusion of her trip, the best case scenario said she would return with either one or two powerful new warriors for the tribe and hopefully worst case would be eliminating the single most dangerous threat the tribe had ever faced in its long history.<p>All Cologne knew was she had to get to Japan, then to Tokyo, and then to Nerima, but most importantly to Shampoo before she made one of the biggest mistakes of her life.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flash forwards Rooftops of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Huh?" Ranma intelligently replied. This wasn't meant to happen for a long time still.<p>'Why couldn't Shampoo be trying to kill me?' Ranma silently asked himself.<p>'Wow, now that was a stupid thought if I've ever had one,' the pigtailed martial artist kicked himself.<p>"But I already have a fiancée," Ranma tried to argue, knowing even before he said the words that they would prove useless.<p>"Ho ho ho ho ho Son-in-law, I really don't think you want to refuse us." Cologne replied.<p>'Wait a minute she sounds a lot more reasonable this time around than she did all the previous times, usually she just tries to tell me I have no choice in the matter.' Ranma thought.<p>Shampoo just kept rubbing herself against him and holding him tightly so he couldn't run away.<p>"Don't I have any say in this matter at all? Do I have any choice?"<p>"Well everyone always has some say in everything, like when you have a knife to your throat you can always stand still so you don't cut yourself or you can always thrust your throat upon the knife slitting your own throat," the Amazon matriarch replied smoothly, a dangerous glint in her eye.<p>"Oh and so agreeing you would be like thrusting my throat into the blade." Ranma replied with heavily lidded eyes.<p>'The boy always did have a bad attitude' Cologne mused to herself, locking eyes with the young man.<p>'Oh great I really didn't need these two this early on,' Ranma thought to himself, meeting the old ghoul's gaze.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"The Amazons are there now," the cloaked figure stated.<p>"My what a firm grip of the obvious you have there," replied the armoured figure.<p>"So what now," asked the cloaked figure.<p>"I'm sure that Athena will get involved soon enough if she hasn't already, she and the other gods those accursed amazons follow." The armoured figure groused.<p>"Yes, so what are we going to do about it this time."<p>"Well it's quite simple, there are a few of the gods that couldn't care less what any other being says. I merely talked with them for a while and got them interested in actually interfering."<p>"How many gods are we talking about here," asked the cloaked figure, peering intently at its companion<p>"Four, and what makes it even better is all of them are chaos gods."<p>If it were possible a tremor of what might have been fear passed through the cloaked figure's frame.<p>"You don't mean the four. The four gods. The four gods of chaos. Khorne, Tzeentch, Slaanesh, and Nurgle."<p>"Indeed I do," the armoured figure replied with a smug voice, "although Nurgle found them altogether far to healthy for his interests and wants nothing to do with them at all. He sees them as the worst form of purity and he will have nothing to do with such disgustingly healthy specimens."<p>"Well at least we don't have to worry about any plagues, but still those four are insane, why did you get in contact with them, you know how dangerous they are."<p>"You aren't the only one who is skilled in subtleties. I know what I am doing." The armoured figure stated firmly.<p>"But still..." The cloaked figure started to reply.<p>"But nothing, besides even if I wanted to do something about it, which I don't, it would be too late. The four have already turned their eyes towards Nerima."<p>"May the gods help whoever gets in their way." Stated the cloaked figure in a quiet voice.<p>As laughing about the chaos gods would be a very bad idea the two merely fell into silence watching for what would happen next.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 19, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>No way No way Even if it's all up to me Now way No way will I ever give up In this whole wide world you're the only you Walking along the beach in the sunshine Beneath the extended pa pa parasol It's like there's a cleansing wind in my heart Blowing those gloomy thoughts right out Whoa ho my fingers tremble Whoa ho my face grows warm It's the first step No doubt about it It's love You got a problem with that No way No way I'm taking up my stance No way No way Make sure that you land that loving blow on me<p>AN: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>You'll have to excuse that last little lyrics, I had kind of petered out while writing the story and needed some inspiration. As such I began watching some episodes of Ranma ½ season seven, well I was actually less inspired by the episodes I saw and more inspired by the opening theme.<p>Due to finals I was no able to write as much as I would have liked on the chapter so I delayed releasing it until Christmas, that way I could make this chapter longer and give everyone a nice Christmas present. Unfortunately I was irrevocably delayed and as tried to upload it the day after Christmas, but lost the file and had to rewrite a good part of the chapter, but as they say, "better late than never." So to welcome in the New Year a little late, I have finished this chapter and am posting it up for everyone's pleasure. University has started again and I wanted to get this chapter up before I really got into my studies. Unfortunately this was not to be the case and I had to delay it again. I never found a really good stopping point for this chapter and couldn't stop writing till I found one. As such this chapter is the longest yet. Midterms are over now and I am on spring break as such I am taking a chance to finish this chapter and get to work on the next chapter.<p>I intend to have all of the main characters of the Nerima Wrecking Crew on the scene by the end of next chapter if it is appropriate. A few faces might appear a little early and a few faces might appear later, but the most important cast members of Ranma ½ will be on the scene soon enough. In the next chapter the role call will grow with a few familiar names and faces.<p>For those of you who are familiar with the strategy game, the world of Warhammer or Warhammer 40K, the four gods of chaos are copyrighted by Games Workshop. The four gods of chaos are seen as extremely evil entities. Khorne is the blood god, lord of slaughter. Slaanesh is the dark prince, prince of all dark and unholy pleasures, Tzeentch is known as the changer of the ways, master of dark magics and mutation, and finally Nurgle is known as the lord of decay, he is responsible for diseases, death, and wasting. Together they are known as the four gods of chaos. Just in case anyone is curious the army I play in Warhammer is the Vampire Counts and in Warhammer 40K I play the Tau army. It is an excellent game and while expensive a lot of fun to play. The four gods of chaos and everything from the Warhammer universe are property of Games Workshop and I in no way claim ownership nor am I making any money off of this.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send me a e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
