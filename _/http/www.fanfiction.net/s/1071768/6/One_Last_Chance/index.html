</div>One Last Chance ch.6<p>****Two Cool for School****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter Akane and Ranma went on their first date together. Upon returning back home, the two found a pair of suitors waiting for them, courtesy of Genma and Soun's past. The suitors were a pair of twins called Miura and Kyushin Kusaragi, two practitioners of the all out school of elementally art. Our heroes of course beat the two in a martial arts match using a very impressive technique. The two have planned on leaving for a few days on a training trip, but first, the second day of school.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Morning, Tendo compound ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"BYE," a pair of voices, one female and the other sometimes male called out as they headed out of the house.<p>"Well Ranma, what do you have think is going to happen this morning?"<p>"I'm not sure, but Nabiki has a list of guys I defeated yesterday and a list of those who didn't fight. If they do choose to fight one list is going to get longer while the other gets shorter."<p>"What happens if some of those perverts you've already beaten decide not to pay attention to the challenge and decide to attack you again."<p>"Nabiki said she'd take care of them, and I for one would rather go ten rounds with Ryoga or Herb then deal with Nabiki's wrath."<p>"I guess your right, but she's not that bad."<p>Ranma shot a questioning look at Akane who quickly relented under his gaze.<p>"Ok so maybe she is, but that doesn't mean you should point it our where she could hear you."<p>Ranma laughed as he placed his hands on Akane's waist and the two jumped on to the fence together. Running towards the school, Akane held Ranma's hands on her waist when he tried to pull them away.<p>She didn't need his support to balance, but she enjoyed the feel of his rough, strong, yet gentle hands supporting her too much to allow him to let go. Ranma for his part didn't try to remove his hands with too much effort, as he was content to let them be.<p>In his peripheral vision, he saw the old lady splashing the ground he would have been walking had Akane and he been walking on the ground like they originally had a whole two years ago.<p>As Furinkan's gates came into view the two martial artists jumped off the fence. Neither was quite sure what to expect, although they could always hope for the best.<p>The sight of the hentai horde wasn't entirely unexpected, but neither was it a welcome sight. On the other hand the fact that they were just standing there looking ready to cry, rather than charging towards them with declarations of love and defeat.<p>"What do you lot want, I already beat most of you yesterday so you can't challenge me again, if the rest of you want a beating, I'll be more than happy to oblige you, if that's what you really want." Ranma added the last part with an evil grin.<p>One individual dressed in a baseball uniform stepped forwards.<p>"We have come to say our goodbyes to Akane Tendo, we have seen that we stand no chance against your fiancée, congratulations Ranma Saotome."<p>Another boy dressed in a fencing outfit stepped forwards<p>"After all, you defeated Kuno over several times yesterday; he was the school's greatest fighter."<p>Another large boy dressed as a sumo decided to put his two cents in.<p>"Yeah, and the school's greatest pervert."<p>There was a murmur of agreement from the assembled group. Neither Ranma nor Akane felt like debating the point, mostly because anyone would have a hard time coming up with an argument against Kuno's perversion, even the Kendo team who usually backed him up in all things.<p>Ranma and Akane relaxed at hearing the words of the admissions from the assembled group. It seemed one more obstacle was down already and they didn't have to spend several days beating them up.<p>As they walked into school a thought came to Ranma.<p>"Not that I'm complaining or nothing, but shouldn't Kuno of been there denying the fact I beat him?" Ranma asked, following the weeping horde of boys into the school.<p>Akane began to giggle; "you do realize that we left Kuno in the nurse's office last night."<p>"Yeah, so what, he looked like he needed time to think about what we told him."<p>"Well if you remember, we sort of forgot to untie him."<p>Ranma began to laugh as well.<p>"Oh well I'm sure somebody let him go."<p>The two walked to class, neither aware of the bound Kendoist sleeping in the nurses office.<p>The day proceeded without interruption from anything unusual. Unusual being a relative term of course, this is Nerima after all. Contrary to popular belief Nerima was weird before Ranma came to Nerima. It was merely that many people chose to ignore the weirdness around them and act like nothing had happened. Akane was after all another chaos avatar, Ranma's arrival merely amplified the disruption and made it harder to ignore.<p>Kuno didn't bother them once all day, but that mostly had to do with the fact that the nurse not releasing Kuno from his imprisonment. She didn't want to release him since he looked so sane asleep in his restraints.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Compound later that day ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"I swear if those two excuses for fathers have a fiancée in there waiting for either of us, I'm going to slowly and brutally maim them." Ranma growled.<p>"I'll help," agreed Akane as they approached the door to the house.<p>"We're home," the apprehensive couple called as they entered the house, slipping off their shoes.<p>"Oh, Akane, Ranma, welcome home. Father and Mr. Saotome would like to talk with the two of you."<p>Kasumi greeted the two fiancées, seemingly oblivious to their displeasure at her words. The two traded less then happy looks before walking down the hall and stepping into the living room.<p>Akane lashed out with her foot after stepping into the room, catching her father as he jumped at her from where he had been hiding by the doorframe.<p>Ranma's uppercut caught his father as he dived at Ranma from the ceiling.<p>The two parents went flying into the center of the room, Genma bouncing off the ceiling first, hard enough to shake the boards, but not hard enough to go crashing through them.<p>"And just what did you two fools think you were doing?" Akane growled.<p>"Yeah pops, what's the meaning of this?" Ranma questioned, holding up a pair of rags that their fathers had, up until a few seconds ago, been holding.<p>"Well Akane, my daughter, we wanted to congratulate you and your fiancée for you victory last night."<p>"How with a wedding?"<p>The two older men nodded.<p>"Care to explain this old man?" Ranma asked, once again gesturing to the rags, which he now held in a clenched fist.<p>"We just wanted to make sure it was a surprise for you and Akane so that it would be special. Oh whatever did I do to deserve such an ungrateful son?"<p>"Besides toss that same son into a pit of starving cats?" If a person listened closely, one could detect a hint of anger in Ranma's tone.<p>"Or engage that same son to multiple women and sell him for a simple meal?" If a person had been deaf they still would have been able to hear the anger in Akane's every word.<p>"Next time, try asking us if we want to, before you try the chloroform."<p>Ranma threw the rags at Soun and Genma, each rag hitting a father in the face.<p>The two older men gasped in shock as the rags hit them, not a very smart thing to do, before passing out where they lay.<p>Akane walked over to the two sorry excuses for martial artists and removed the rags from their faces. She was angry enough to maim, but she didn't really want to kill the two idiots..Yet.<p>"Well looks like they're going to be out for a while, do you want to get packed and leave now or wait for tomorrow?"<p>"I think we should probably leave after dinner, and get one of Kasumi's delicious meals in us first before we head out. Even the best camp meal can't compare to a home cooked meal."<p>"Baka, you're always thinking with your stomach."<p>"What can I say, I need to eat properly if I want to stay strong, and so do you."<p>"Fine, but first I want to do something we've never been able to do before." Akane's face turned upwards into a very Nabiki Cheshire grin.<p>"And what would that be?" Ranma asked, usually whenever anyone got a Nabiki grin it meant mischief at best and terror at worst. For some reason whenever one of the Tendo daughters did it, it conveyed the message even more clearly then a regular person's grin would, albeit no one could ever recall Kasumi wearing any smile but her usual serene, at peace with the world, everything is ok, tension diffuser smile<p>"I want to kiss you in front of our parents and not be standing next to a priest a day or two later." Akane's grin turned into a very seductive smile.<p>"Your wish is my command." Now Ranma was the one wearing a Nabiki grin.<p>The two of them stepped forwards and engaged in a lip lock that was even more passionate then it looked to any observer, but since the only two possible witnesses happened to be unconscious the point is moot.<p>They held that position for nearly a minute before breaking apart, both grinning like a pair of c-c-cats who just left a room, which once contained several canaries.<p>"My my, aren't we a naughty girl."<p>"You enjoyed it too hentai."<p>Ranma stuck his tongue out at her. "Did I ever say I didn't?"<p>"Don't point that at me unless you're ready to use it."<p>The two engaged in another kiss.<p>"I'm home." Nabiki's voice rang out as the front door slid open and closed. Nabiki was greeted to the sight of a laughing Akane, nearly bowling her over, run upstairs followed shortly behind by an equally happy Ranma.<p>"Pack only what think you'll need." Nabiki heard Ranma say as he and her sister split apart, her entering her room and Ranma heading for the guest room where he and his father were sleeping.<p>"Don't think you're getting away that easily Saotome." Nabiki muttered under her breath.<p>After that little disappearing stunt he and her sister had pulled yesterday, disappearing from her and then showing up after going on a date of all things. The Saotomes had only been here two days after all. Nabiki even for all her intelligence can still be forgiven for forgetting the somewhat unusual fact that while chronologically, the Saotomes had only been here for two days; Ranma and Akane possessed two additional years worth of knowledge.<p>She could overlook the fact that they had gotten away from her. That could be rectified in the future by merely having one of her underlings watching Ranma at any given point outside of the house. It wasn't as if he could jump over building to so that shouldn't be too hard.<p>She could overlook the fact that Akane had suddenly gotten a very new and beautiful dress that perfectly complimented Ranma's attire. She would merely have to borrow said dress for an indefinite period of time after failing, in accordance to a mental lapse, to ask permission to take possession of the property in question. After all share and share alike among sisters right? Briefly a less then pure part of her mind wondered if that applied to her sister's fiancée, he looked better then just about all the guys at school. His well-defined muscles and handsome face would have most women looking twice. Maybe she'd have to accidentally walk in on him in the near future while he was taking a dip in the furo, completely accidental of course.<p>She could overlook the fact that Akane and Ranma had taken down two obviously skilled martial artists in only a total of six punches, four from their opponents and a single punch apiece from Ranma and Akane. That neither the recipient nor the attacker of each punch had been nearer then ten feet from the other the entire match wasn't a problem either. That Akane and Ranma had created what seemed to be a vortex of air was no trouble to her.<p>What she did have trouble with on the other hand was how Ranma had surprised and put her off balance several times over the last three days by merely being there. It was almost as if Ranma's arrival heralded chaos itself. She shook thought off as merely her needing to finish conducting business with Kuno faster so she was around his speech patterns less. Him putting her off balance like that was something she also could have overlooked, had it not been for the fact he was doing it both without conscious thought or intention, and the sheer number of times he was seemingly successful in his ventures.<p>This Ranma who had come into the life of the Tendo family like a whirlwind, seemingly bringing his father along for the ride rather then the other way around. A ride, which it seemed the Tendo family was now along for.<p>She could only guess at what would happen in the future, but that didn't let her plans to make money be distracted by such meaningless concerns as what might happen. She found it easier to pay attention to problems and situations which where more in her control and knowledge.<p>Ranma Saotome was still too much of an enigma for her to adequately clarify him. She really wasn't sure of his skill as a fighter. He seemed good enough and he obviously had skill, his battles against the twins the night before had been more then enough proof of that. Yet the fights he had been in to date had all ended too quickly for him to see more then a punch or kick he threw that ended the match.<p>She needed to get to know Ranma better if she were to be able to set odds on him in the gambling pools she knew would spring up around school by his arrival. In fact she already had plans on several she might start, but she needed to find out more about Ranma Saotome to hedge the bets so as to give her the best odds.<p>If there was one thing Nabiki Tendo didn't like it was not knowing all the facts, her other pet peeves included bokken wielding idiots, any waste of money, and a lack of control over any situation. Her likes almost all include money, mischief, or ice cream so I don't really think I'll go into them. After all none of this serves any purpose to furthering the story except for the first sentence of this paragraph up to the comma.<p>Nabiki wandered up the stairs and headed for her room, visions of yen and possibilities of exploiting Ranma coming to her head. She was beginning to give some serious thought to whether or not the hormonally charged Furinkan male populous would be interested in some pictures of a certain red-head in less then normal amounts of clothes. Hmm, it just might work; maybe even Kuno would buy a picture or two, just maybe.<p>Nabiki shut the door to her room and began making plans for increasing her fiscal reserves at the expense of a certain freeloading pigtailed houseguest who just might end up being her brother-in-law.<p>Kasumi entered the living room to find two old foolish martial artists passed out peacefully on the floor.<p>"Oh my."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo House, even later that evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Around a certain dinner table 3 girls and a sometimes guy sat eating a meal that looked for all intensive purposes delicious.<p>"So where did dad and Mr. Saotome disappear too?" Nabiki asked.<p>"Well they seemed to be tired so I put them to bed early." Kasumi responded.<p>"Hmm I wonder why they are so tired ehh Akane?"<p>"I have no idea Ranma, they must have found someone who disagreed with them on some issue."<p>"Really, I wonder what the disagreement could have been." Kasumi just didn't seem to pick up the not so subtle undertones of the conversation that her sister and her sister's fiancée were having.<p>"Maybe they tried to force somebody into something that they didn't want." Nabiki suggested, watching the exchange carefully. Ok, now I'm sure that those two have something to do with this.<p>"I don't think so Nabiki, I have a feeling that they merely tried to force somebody to do something before they were ready for it. That seems something more along the lines of something those two would do. Don't you agree Ranma?"<p>"Definitely, I think my pops must be a bad influence on your father. The two should really be more careful or they might end up getting hurt.'<p>"Akane, Ranma, I heard you mention something about taking a trip, where are you planning on going?"<p>Nabiki stared at Kasumi in shock, how did her older sister know about something she hadn't even caught scent of. So caught up in her own thoughts she hadn't even paid attention to Ranma's comment about packing when he and Akane had almost run her down as she came home.<p>"Ranma and I are going on a training trip for a couple of days We need some time together away from prying ears" Akane shot Nabiki a glance that could very easily have been mistaken for a glare, "and prying eyes."<p>"A couple of days with no Kuno won't hurt either." Ranma added.<p>"So when are you two leaving?"<p>Nabiki was curious, she had plans to make, maybe she should get a couple of her associates to tail her sister or at least watch over her, after all, she still didn't know what type of man Ranma was and she wasn't going to trust her sister's safety to just anybody.<p>"After dinner as a matter of fact, we thought it best to get going right away so we'd be able to get in more training tomorrow than if we had to leave then."<p>Nabiki frowned slightly, that wouldn't do at all, she wouldn't be able to get any of her underlings briefed and ready fast enough to follow the two martial artists, if they really were planning on leaving so suddenly.<p>She would have offered to go herself, except she really didn't want to spend an uncertain number of days in the wilderness with those two, despite whatever information she could find out. That was the point of having underlings, associates, and lackeys in the first place. She'd let them get away from her this once, but that was it. After they got back she was going to watch Ranma like a hawk and find out just what she wanted to know from the raven-haired time traveling martial artist.<p>"Would you like me to pack you some food?"<p>"Thanks Kasumi that would be great we wouldn't want to have to eat Ak-."<p>Ranma's next words were cut off as a rush of air left Ranma's mouth. This was largely caused by his fiancée's elbow was in his stomach.<p>"What did you do that for?" Ranma asked, after straightening up.<p>"Preemptive preventative measures, that's what I did that for." Akane returned.<p>"Huh?"<p>"Simple, I figure while you teach me martial arts, I'm going to help you learn to keep your mouth shut so you're less inclined to have any run-ins with mallet-sama."<p>Ranma gulped, why did Akane have to say it that way. He would have opened his mouth to say something, but since Akane's elbow was still right in front of him, he realized that discretion was the better part of valor and kept his trap shut. The taste of his own feet was definitely something he wouldn't miss.<p>"Good job Ranma, I knew you were a fast learner. Now, here's your reward." Akane leaned over and gave him a kiss on the cheek.<p>They were interrupted by the gagging sounds coming from Nabiki.<p>"If you don't mind, some of us are trying to eat here and would greatly appreciate it if we could keep our food down."<p>"You're just jealous that you don't have a hunky fiancée with such a hot body Nabiki." Strangely enough this comment came from Akane and not Ranma.<p>"I'm not jealous, why would I be jealous of a jerk like him?"<p>"He may be a jerk, but he's my jerk, so don't go getting any ideas." Nabiki was shocked by the level of possessiveness she heard in Akane's voice.<p>Akane had always been possessive over things that belonged to her, clothes, toys, weights, but this was different. Akane had always been at least willing to share her things, but not this time. Nabiki clearly heard the underlying threat in Akane's voice. It seemed to say, 'He belongs to me, try anything and you will suffer.' Not that the ice queen would ever admit it, but she was slightly scared at her sister's words.<p>For once, not knowing what to say, she merely nodded.<p>Akane seemed to accept that, but she still had a wary look in her eyes.<p>"I put the food in your packs Akane, you can lave whenever you're ready." Kasumi said, entering the room and breaking the growing air of tension that had formed between the two sisters.<p>"Thank you Kasumi, I'm not as good a cook as I am a martial artist, and the memory of this meal will at least offset what I'm going to be eating."<p>Akane was about to elbow Ranma again, when she realized he had not even mentioned her cooking.<p>Ranma stood up, "well Akane, shall we go?" Ranma asked, extending his hand down to help her up.<p>Akane was tempted to slap his hand away and stand on her own, but instead she took his hand and stood with his help. He isn't trying to demean you, he's being kind, don't hurt him for trying to be nice.<p>"Ok Ranma, let's go."<p>The two stood up and left the room, heading for the packs they had left by the door.<p>Hearing the door shut as the two left, Nabiki breathed a sigh of relief.<p>"Something wrong Nabiki?" Kasumi asked, noticing the brief flicker of emotion across her sister's face.<p>"It was Akane, I teased her about Ranma and she practically threatened me."<p>"Are you scared she'd hurt you over Ranma, you're her sister." Kasumi tried to comfort her sister.<p>"You didn't see her before you came in, when she thought I might have tried to take Ranma from her."<p>"Do you think she'd really hurt you over Ranma, they only known each other for two days, or maybe two years if what they claim is true. She's known us for sixteen or eighteen years."<p>Nabiki looked at her older sister skeptically.<p>"We don't know what happened in those two years. From what they told us the other night, it seems like I might have caused some trouble for them over those two years. I'm not sure, but I think that just maybe she would be willing to kill for him and he might be willing to kill for her."<p>"Now Nabiki-"<p>"No Kasumi, you didn't see her a few moments ago. I was actually scared by her. I don't know what she and Ranma have or had, but I do believe it would be dangerous to get between those two."<p>Kasumi was shocked by the vehemence in her sister's statement. She had never seen Nabiki so shaken up since their mother's death. Even Kasumi's seemingly unshakeable demeanor was slightly disturbed by not just what her sister was saying, but also because of the way her sister was acting. Akane was the one who was meant to display extreme emotions, not Nabiki and definitely not herself.<p>Somehow, for some reason, in some way, everything had suddenly changed since the Saotomes came into their life, whether for the better or the worse was hard to say. All that the two older Tendo sisters could be sure of was that they didn't know their little sister as well as they should, and they definitely didn't know enough about their new house guests and possible in-laws.<p>Neither sister was quite sure which revelation was more disturbing.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"You're really pushing it this time."<p>The seated figure turned to look at the cloaked figure who was standing behind him.<p>"And what do you mean by that?" The seated figure asked.<p>"Genma, Soun, Kuno, and most of the others are fair game. Kasumi is someone no sorcerer, demon lord, or even greater god would tamper with. She is off limits by unspoken mutual consent. Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be to messing with her?"<p>The cloaked figure was sorely tempted to start pacing back and forwards to help work off some of his frustration at the seated figure's seeming stupidity. How could any being be stupid enough to meddle with an untouchable like Kasumi?<p>"I haven't done anything with or to Kasumi. I know how much trouble that would cause. Even I wouldn't risk so much just for a little amusement. Hell, even Puck at his worst wouldn't be that stupid."<p>The cloaked figure didn't say anything, given the seated figures statement, yet the figure's actions to date were sorely in contrary to the statement. That didn't explain why the Tendo sister reacted that way.<p>"Then what about her reaction to Nabiki's reaction to Akane when the youngest Tendo practically threatened her own sister over Ranma? Are you saying you had nothing to do with that?"<p>The seated figure almost stood up to angrily retort, but managed to remain seated.<p>"That's right, that was all them and their doing, I had no part in the little drama that just unfolded before us."<p>"Then this is troubling news for us."<p>"Why do you say that?"<p>"Because it would mean that you are not the only person who appears to want to interfere."<p>"Really?"<p>"That or something more than what we thought happened when those two began their new lives."<p>The two stayed in quiet contemplation for some time, merely watching the two human martial artists who had so many beings interested in them.<p>The cloaked figure began to laugh.<p>"What do you find so funny about this situation?"<p>"Oh it's quite simple actually."<p>The cloaked figure lowered leaned on the back of the seated figure's chair and explained the new theory it had recently come up with.<p>"Really?"<p>"Yes." The cloaked figure nodded slightly in affirmation.<p>The seated figure was no longer seated as it stood up and stepped into the light.<p>The armour the figure wore was black as night. Leather bracers over pale white skin, a hardened leather breastplate covered the torso. A cape as dark as pitch flowed down the figures back to boots of black leather.<p>The face was a skull, but it possessed one discrepancy from most other skulls. Two beautiful eyes. The two eyes were the eyes of a human. Two sky blue eyes.<p>"Well that changes things, doesn't it? Well my beautiful Ranma, have no fear things are going well. Soon, soon, my lovely god slayer."<p>The armoured figure laughed.<p>The cloaked figure joined in.<p>The two figures laughed.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TBC, END OF CHAPTER 6 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Well that is the end of this chapter. I wanted to write something special for Christmas, but I decided that I couldn't really do anything special this early in the story besides begin the introduction of one of the two figures.<p>All I can say is merry Christmas to everyone out there who celebrates Christmas. For those of you who don't celebrate Christmas, happy December 25th.<p>Let me know how this chapter has turned out. Please Read and Review. I welcome your comments, criticism, and all manner of responses, although I really don't like the flames that much. I must say that I am surprised by the number of reviews this has gotten so far, but I am also grateful to know so many people are reading this fanfic and are seemingly enjoying it.<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me and have me respond please E-mail me at
