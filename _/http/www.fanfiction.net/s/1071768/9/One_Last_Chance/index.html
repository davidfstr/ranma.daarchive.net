</div>One Last Chance ch.9<p>**** A Time to Love ****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter the couple went on a training trip together to get themselves up to speed. In the process, they got closer together and trained. Ryoga encountered another guy on the road who is also after Ranma for some reason. The two of them teamed up to find Ranma and went off together, but with Ryoga leading, so we won't see them for a while . . .probably. Genma and Soun began to plan on how to get Ranma and Akane married now that they are in love. Kuno may or may not have been released from the nurse's bed he was strapped too. We'll just have to see, now on with the new chapter.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Come on love, we've got to get up and train." Ranma said, stroking Akane's hair.<p>"Do we have too?" His chest was so comfortable, why couldn't he just let her lie in on him for once. It felt so good just to lay here. It wasn't that she was sore from the previous two days, not at all.<p>Just because whenever she moved a muscle she felt the pain of the two previous days didn't mean she wasn't willing to train that day, but it was a very good reason to stay in bed.<p>Ranma for his part was willing to agree with Akane in this department if she asked him. His body wasn't used to quite this much work. Well at least not this old body of his. If Akane asked him to just lie in bed for that day, he'd probably agree with her.<p>"Ranma, do you think you can give me a massage, I'm still sore from yesterday, my body is killing me."<p>"Yeah, I understand what you mean Akane, I'm pretty sore as well, I think we might have overdone it over the last couple of days. These bodies really aren't in that great a shape."<p>"You insulting my body Ranma?" Akane growled.<p>She would have been more threatening if she hadn't moved her head slightly to nuzzle into Ranma's chest at the same time as squeezing him slightly tighter.<p>"Not at all, I'm just saying that it will take a lot more than the time we have to improve ourselves up to where we used to be."<p>"Then what should we do, I still don't feel that comfortable fighting with this body."<p>"Now you know what the curse is like."<p>"What?"<p>"The curse, when I first got it, everything in my body was different, my muscles, my reach, my speed, my balance, my strength. It was very disorienting till I learnt to control myself."<p>"I never realized what it must have been like until now."<p>"So are you two going to lie in there all day, or are you going to come out here?"<p>Ranma and Akane paused their conversation at the new voice.<p>Ranma was the first of the two to speak. "Akane, since when did you learn ventriloquism?"<p>"I could ask you the same question Ranma."<p>The voice, which the two had heard, came from outside the tent and if they were any judge of the tone and pitch, the voice came from a male. In addition to that, the voice sounded very familiar to both of them.<p>"Well, you two are just a laugh riot, aren't you? Now are you coming out of the tent or do I have to come in?"<p>Ranma unzipped the tent flap and stepped out, Akane right behind him.<p>Sitting at their now lit campfire was a foreign man that neither had seen before. He was sitting with his back against a tree stump and his legs stretched out in front of him.<p>The man had shoulder length golden blonde hair tied which flowed freely down his back untied. His eyes were a light shade of blue and appeared to catch everything that went on around him. The complexion of his skin was very fair and smooth.<p>He was dressed in a set of beautifully made clothes. His pants were a pair of soft brown leather. His white shirt appeared to be made from a fine cotton cloth.<p>"Like what you see?" The man asked with a smile.<p>For some reason neither fiancée as particularly irritated at the man sitting uninvited by their campfire. Both were more curious as to who he was. Their curiosity was increased by the fact that both of them had the feeling they knew who this person was, or at least had met this person before.<p>"Who are you?" Ranma asked finally.<p>"I'm me."<p>"Who is me?" Akane asked<p>"No child, the phrase is who am I?"<p>"I don't know," replied Akane hotly.<p>"That's not my name, want another try or should I tell you?"<p>"Tell us!" Ranma demanded.<p>"Tell you what?"<p>"Your name." Akane practically screamed.<p>"What about it?"<p>"ARRRGGGGHHHH!" both fiancées screamed at the devil of a man who was tormenting them so easily.<p>"Now now, don't be like that I was just trying to introduce myself."<p>"Very funny way of doing it." Akane muttered darkly.<p>"Aww, don't be like that, I'm just trying to lighten the atmosphere up a little with some humour."<p>"You've got a funny sense of humour you know don't you?" Ranma asked.<p>"Heh, you know, I get told that all the time, there was this one time Thor told me that . . . Umm, I guess that's not important, but I understand what you mean."<p>"So just who are you?"<p>The man tried to sound sincere and apologetic, but he just couldn't keep the grin off of his face, or the mirth from his voice.<p>"I'm Loki, sorry about this."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Highlands of Tibet ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"So where do you think we are now?"<p>"Mt. Fuji,"<p>A pair of guys that were wandering through a particularly high mountain range weren't having that much fun at the moment. This most likely had something to do with the fact that on their way to Japan they had crossed into Tibet and were currently in its not so inconsiderable mountains.<p>"Really, so that would explain why we haven't been able to find a person who understands a word of Japanese since yesterday. It also must explain those funny looking gaijin that we had to beat the hell out of earlier today when they tried to stop us. When was the last time you were in Japan that you encountered bandits who couldn't even speak Japanese?"<p>"Well why don't you try leading for a while and see how easy it is?" Ryoga tried to argue.<p>"Not a chance in hell, you've gotten us so lost that I think I'll wait till I can find out where we are before I take over leading us. That appears to be the safest thing to do."<p>"Fine."<p>With their brief conversation done Ryoga started walking off in a random direction which he knew was the right one.<p>With a shrug his traveling companion followed him.<p>"Ranma Saotome, this is all your fault!"<p>"You say that a lot, what did he do curse you or something?"<p>Together they headed back towards China, going the right way for once.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Loki, why does that name sound so familiar and why do I get the feeling that I know you from somewhere?" Ranma asked<p>"I get that feeling too, what is it you want, and how do you know us." Akane added.<p>"Simple enough questions, and you are partially right, you do know me, but we have never really met properly or had formal introductions. I have watched over both of you since you were children."<p>He held up a hand forestalling any comments from either of the two martial artists.<p>"I am a god, more specifically a chaos god, even more specifically, the best known and most powerful chaos god of them all."<p>"What does that have to do with us?" Ranma asked.<p>"You two are the favored of my chosen. As such I have taken a personal role in many of the instances that have shaped your lives."<p>"For example?" Akane prompted.<p>"Ranma, the Neko-ken has driven almost all it's users completely insane shortly after learning it, but you retained your sanity, do you remember anything about the experience?"<p>"Not really, it was cold and dark and the monsters were down there and then when I came out. . . Wait a minute."<p>Ranma stopped talking as his jaw dropped.<p>"Ranma, what is it?" Akane asked, concern evident in her voice.<p>Ranma turned his face to Akane, he worked his jaw up and down a couple of times before turning again to face the chaos god.<p>"It was you wasn't it?"<p>"Yes, it was." Loki nodded sagely with a sad smile on his face.<p>"What was him?" Akane asked getting quite confused.<p>"And that night after Jusenkyo when I was cursed?"<p>Loki nodded again this time, putting his hand behind the back of his head and scratching nervously.<p>"And then the cat tongue point, that was you too?" Ranma's voice broke a little as he said this.<p>"Damn, didn't think you'd remember that one, guess I was a little careless."<p>"Thank you." Ranma whispered hoarsely as he threw his arms around the god who encircled him with his own arm and held the boy.<p>"It was the least I could do for making you suffer as you must have by being one of my chosen."<p>Akane could only stare in shock while her fiancée, who had trouble enough showing public affection to her and his own mother was freely hugging this stranger, who was a guy no less. For some reason she felt no anger at this or even jealousy over her man hugging this stranger.<p>"Would one of you two please tell me what the hell is going on." Akane's tone made it very obvious this wasn't a request.<p>"Akane," Ranma's tone was if anything calm and peaceful, "Don't get angry, I know if nothing else Loki means us no harm."<p>Akane on an instinctual level felt the same way; she just didn't know how Ranma could be so sure about it with this stranger, although it just seemed right.<p>"What are you talking about Ranma?"<p>"Loki here has helped me through some really bad times in my life, but I never realized it till right now."<p>"What?" Akane was shocked.<p>"When I had my Neko-ken training, remember what pops told you about an old woman that used to bring me out of it?"<p>"Yeah, but what does. . ."<p>Ranma cut his fiancée off, "that was really Loki in disguise. After we left we heard she died suddenly, but never thought anything about it, until now I realize I never knew a single thing about her."<p>Loki and Ranma stood up. Loki put one arm over Ranma's shoulder and the two turned to face Akane.<p>Loki nodded and continued Ranma's story, "Ranma was in danger of loosing his sanity and maybe his very life. I couldn't let him go and so I calmed him down and put a restraint on the Neko-ken, should it ever overpower him one of my chosen would be able to break him out of it he'd instinctively head for the closest one, but his father just had to go and throw him back into that damned pit over and over, I almost killed the old bastard."<p>"Then there was the time that I fell into the cursed springs at Jusenkyo, that night I was at an all time low and feeling really bad, Loki came to me in my dreams and cheered me up."<p>Loki chuckled ruefully, "well I felt kind of bad about that see, and I'm sort of responsible for the springs. One night Lolth and I were out drinking together and we both got kind of smashed, well she bragged about how she could change her unworthy followers into half spider creatures and how fanatical and devoted her followers were. Well I can't quite remember what happened, but when I woke up the next day there were all these springs around me. It seems after Lolth, man she is one wild deity, and I had an argument we sort of created the springs then went looking for interesting creatures to dump in them."<p>"What sort of things?" Akane hesitantly asked.<p>"Demons, animals, angels, just about any creature we could get our hands on. We even managed to catch this tentacle monster, man Lolth was pissed at it."<p>"Umm, so there's a spring of drowned tentacle monster at Jusenkyo?" Akane shivered at the thought.<p>"No, about 1500 years ago some girl fell in the spring and drowned."<p>"The spring of drowned girl used to be the spring of drowned tentacle monster?" Akane asked in shock, Ranma was too stunned at the implications to speak.<p>Loki shrugged, "more or less."<p>Akane felt the conversation should be steered in a new direction very quickly.<p>"What about the cat's tongue point that you mentioned?"<p>Ranma looked down and a look of shame came over his face.<p>Loki squeezed Ranma's shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile.<p>"You don't have to tell her, but I think she has a right to know. In fact, I believe that it would be best if you told her, but it is still your choice."<p>Ranma sighed, "No, you're right, Akane deserves to know this."<p>Akane was holding her breathe in suspense, what was it he had to tell her? Those other two incidents were among the most traumatic experiences Ranma had gone through, what could have happened.<p>"Akane, when Cologne hit me with the cat's tongue pressure point I was at a whole new low and suffering some pretty bad depression."<p>Akane had known Ranma had been depressed, that was why she had taken him to the carnival where he had learned the Kachyuu Tenshin Amaguriken. She leaned a little closer so as not to hear his words.<p>"The night before the festival, I couldn't take it anymore and decided to end it."<p>Akane gasped, she had never thought it could be so bad. She saw tears in the corners of Ranma's eyes and knew he was serious.<p>"I had just gotten my Tanto out and was ready to kill myself when I passed out."<p>"I couldn't let Ranma kill himself so I came to him and talked to him for a couple of hours, by the end of it he was willing to go on with life, although if you hadn't taken him to that little celebration where he learnt the Amazon technique he might have done it anyway."<p>As Loki finished talking he gave a shamed Ranma a hug.<p>Akane just stood there stunned, she had no idea what to say, but once again felt it was a very good idea to change the topic.<p>"You said you watched over both of us, did you mean just Ranma and by proxy me, or did you mean both of us separately?"<p>Loki laughed, and silently mouthed, 'thank you' to her.<p>"I meant both of you separately. I watched over you and helped you when I thought it was necessary."<p>Akane's eyes got a tear in it when a memory suddenly hit her.<p>"Mommy?"<p>Loki smiled sadly once again and nodded.<p>"You were then when the cloaked man took mommy?"<p>"Yes I was child."<p>A fire came into Akane's eyes at a different memory.<p>"You were there after Kuno's proclamation."<p>"Now that was one of the greater acts of stupidity I've seen from the poetry mangler."<p>"And you were there by Ranma when I died in China."<p>The god nodded, Akane was truly crying now.<p>Ranma and Loki extended an arm each to her.<p>She obligingly ran into the embrace, putting an arm around both of them.<p>"What did you mean about your mother Akane?" Ranma asked his fiancée.<p>"When she died I saw a cloaked figure reach out and take mommy, Loki was there too. That night he came to me in my room and made me feel better when I was angry. You gave me mallet-sama and told me how to keep it hidden till I needed it."<p>"Yes I did."<p>"Remind me to thank you for giving her that later." Ranma growled<p>"Hey, she needed a release for her anger, and that seemed like a good idea."<p>"Fine, I can live with that, but what about Kuno's announcement, why would that be such a momentous occasion."<p>"When Loki came to me that time, it was the same day Kuno made the announcement, all the things that had been happening to me since I got to high school, all the problems with the boys and other students came to a head at that point. I couldn't take it anymore and I was going to run away and escape."<p>"That's when I put her to sleep and came to talk for a while."<p>"Although I didn't remember till just now, Loki convinced me not to run away. He told me to remain strong and that an ally was coming, a kindred spirit as he put it."<p>"Damn, I wasn't expecting you two to remember all those sleep sessions, I guess I must have underestimated you."<p>"Don't feel too bad, lots of people underestimate us all the time, they usually learn pretty quick just how good I am." Ranma factually stated.<p>"You used to underestimate my skill too Ranma, so don't say anything."<p>"Yes dear, now what was that you mentioned about China, all I remember is holding your body and calling out to you."<p>"I remember, you had your eyes turned heavenwards and were screaming for me. Loki was standing behind you and calling for me to return. He said something I can't remember to the cloaked figure that was holding me and then I returned to my body."<p>"You were there for us even then?" Ranma asked the god.<p>"I've always tried to be there for you, given the atrocious fathers you had, I figured you'd need me."<p>Tears trickled down both Ranma and Akane's faces as they increased the pressure of the hug.<p>"Calm down my children, you've made me proud to call you two the first among my chosen."<p>"So what are you doing here now, being here with Akane and no distractions I feel better than I have in my life?"<p>"Well I came to help you and give you some warning as to what is to come."<p>"Why do I get the feeling that I'm not going to like this?" Akane asked bluntly.<p>Loki just chuckled.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ On a boat off the coast of Japan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>She was ready for this, soon her hunt would come to a close, she would find the red headed girl who had gotten lucky and defeated her in front of her village during her moment of glory and she would have her revenge.<p>Then with the outsider dead all she'd have to do is take the girl's head or scalp and return back to China victorious.<p>The Amazon champion smiled grimly, she would kill the outsider girl known as Ranma as quickly as possible and go home.<p>Of course the nice thing about this hunt was it had allowed her to get away from that fool Mu-tsu who was always chasing her.<p>She had gotten passage on a ship once she learnt her target had escaped to Japan.<p>The warrior almost cursed. She would be in the outsider's homeland far from the tribe, and she had next to no skill in the language.<p>In the end it wouldn't matter, she would catch the weakling outsider girl and kill her. That was the word of the law.<p>If perchance some attractive outsider defeated her, she wouldn't be opposed to fulfilling the other side of the outsider law. At the very least, it would help to get that stupid blind idiot off her back.<p>Of course if she didn't really like the guy there was no need to tell him of that little stipulation of the law.<p>The warrior settled down to get some rest, with any luck the ship would arrive in the next few days and she could pick up the outsider's trail from there.<p>She considered herself lucky that the girl had that pet panda traveling with her. She never had much trouble following the two thanks to all the reports and gossip she'd pick up along the way.<p>She opened her book, 'An Amazon's guide to Japanese'. Unfortunately she'd have to improve her language skills if she wanted to be taken seriously or be able to ask for directions to her quarry.<p>Soon, soon that redheaded demon would be dead and she could relax.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, afternoon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"So what you're telling us is that you practically forced the other deities to give us a second chance?" Akane asked, astonished at the being in front of her.<p>"Well in not so many words, yes." The divine trickster, friend of puck, god of chaos, norse god, brother of Thor replied with a grin.<p>"So let me get this straight, you not only forced the god of death to give us another chance, or in Akane's case two chances, and then had forced the rest of the gods to send us back in time." Ranma put in.<p>"Well yes and no."<p>"What do you mean by that?" Ranma and Akane chorused.<p>The three were sitting together with their backs against a felled tree, neither Ranma nor Akane could remember which one of the two had felled the tree, but neither was really thinking about that right now.<p>Akane was resting her head against Loki's left shoulder. Loki had his arm around her.<p>Ranma was sitting on Loki's right and also had his, currently a her, head resting on Loki's right shoulder. She was a she right now because she couldn't bring herself to perform such a display as a guy, but she felt so safe and comfortable like this, she didn't want to not rest her head on Loki's shoulder.<p>"Well I didn't exactly force the particular death god who came for Akane to give her back, but I did give him some advice."<p>"Oh and what might that advice have been?" Akane asked sweetly.<p>"Well I informed him that there are three places to enter the underworld from Japan, five in China, and dozens more around the world. Then I asked him if he honestly thought the godslayer would sit idly by while his mate was away from him. Rather than meet you in hades and leave half the plane decimated by battle and possibly be destroyed he decided to return her soul to her body."<p>"Then how about afterwards, what did you say to convince them to send Ranma and I back in time?"<p>Loki mumbled something under his breath.<p>"What was that you said, I don't think Akane or I caught that last remark?"<p>"I threatened them with the end."<p>"The end of what?"<p>"The end of it all, the apocalypse, Ragnarok, Armagedon, complete destruction, you know, that type of end."<p>Akane and Ranma were shocked.<p>"You threatened all that, just for us?" Ranma asked.<p>Loki nodded.<p>"Awww, you're so sweet at times, I can see where Ranma gets it from."<p>"You said there was something you wanted to warn us about, what was it you wanted to warn us about?"<p>"Well, I can't really explain it very well without you two running through a long lesson in magic and cosmic law, but I'll try to simplify it as much as possible for you."<p>"Gee thanks." Ranma facetiously replied.<p>"Smack him for me would you?" Akane asked.<p>"My pleasure my child." Loki replied with a grin, and gave Ranma a light tap on the back of his head.<p>"Ok, I'll be good, sorry, sorry, please continue."<p>"Well as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, we couldn't send you back in time and let you keep your memory without certain other beings who are affected by the time stream also being affected. Well, when you were sent back in time other beings were well. . . I guess the best way to say it is that they were also taken along for the ride. Demons, Gods, Angels, as well as powerful sorcerers and other magical beings were also sent back in time with you. There are certain criteria one would have to meet before keeping their memory. Any being powerful enough would also be sent back in time, although they might not know the reason for the time differential."<p>"What are the criteria?" Akane asked, her curiosity getting the better of her.<p>"I'd be more than happy to tell you, but to understand you'll need to have some base knowledge onto how it works."<p>"And what would that knowledge be?" Akane asked.<p>"Simple, just get degrees in quantum physics, temporal mechanics, three decades of training in the magic arts, a god to explain it to you, and a couple hundred years of life. Right now you only have one of those things."<p>"Ahh, I see," Akane suddenly went pale, "wait a minute, Saffron wouldn't happen to meet those requirements would he?"<p>Ranma sucked in his breath and held it, waiting ashen faced to hear Loki's response.<p>"Unfortunately yes, he would meet the requirements. That is another reason why I have come to you, in front of you are some of the hardest trials you have ever faced. The martial artists and enemies you have faced before will seem like training against some of the individuals you will meet."<p>"You've got to be kidding me, we didn't even survive last time and now you're telling me that we've got an even harder challenge to face this time."<p>"Yes, last time through you had allies who were also rivals and enemies, this time the lines will be more clean cut and less blurry. Allies will be allies and enemies will be enemies. You must make your choices more carefully this time around, as the goddess of the past told you, you will not get another chance no matter how much influence the chaos gods and I can pull. I've put my faith in you, don't let me down."<p>"I guess that means we should get back to training then." Ranma sighed.<p>"Yeah I guess you're right Ranma, although it's to bad we couldn't just enjoy the day together, I can't remember the last time I was so at peace."<p>"What about last night?" Ranma innocently asked while Loki chuckled.<p>"Baka." Akane said, blushing brightly.<p>"Amazing how we come to yet another reason as to why I am here with you two."<p>"Huh?" Both Fiancées intelligently responded.<p>"As we've been talking, I've been realigning your bodies, over the next few weeks they will get closer and closer to what they were before you two died. The process should be completely finished within a month or two. That way your bodies can adjust to the changing stress."<p>"Thanks, that's going to really help in our training." Ranma gladly thanked the chaos god.<p>"It also means we get tomorrow all to ourselves without having to worry about pushing ourselves like we did yesterday."<p>Ranma definitely liked that idea, and it was more than obvious Loki approved.<p>"You two definitely deserve it. You've brought more chaos and fun into this world then I thought possible for two people."<p>"Thanks Loki, despite what people might say you're not such a bad god."<p>"Since I'm in such a good mood, I think I'll let that one slide child."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"ARRGGGGHHHHHHH"<p>The armoured figure was in quite a mood. This seemed to happen more and more lately.<p>"You really should calm down, if it were possible I'd say you were going to burst a blood vessel or give yourself a stress ulcer."<p>The armoured figure rounded on the cloaked one a fire blazing in its eyes.<p>"Why should I calm down, Loki has taken an active part in things, thanks to the sheer level of chaos surrounding them, I can't even get a scrying spell through the interference, for all I know, Loki is telling them who he wants destroyed and how he wants them to suffer."<p>The cloaked figure although shorter then the armoured one wasn't in the least bit cowed by the other's anger.<p>"You're overreacting."<p>"Am I?"<p>"Yes, you and I both know that isn't Loki's style, he is a lot more likely to just be having a good time, you know how strongly he feels for those two, almost like they were his own children."<p>"Wouldn't surprise me in the least knowing him, the only question is would he be their father or mother?"<p>"That's a low blow."<p>"But it's true."<p>"I'll give you that."<p>The two figures laughed.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TBC, END OF CHAPTER 9 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: We come to the conclusion of yet another chapter. This chapter took quite a bit of thought as it introduces two more characters to the plot.<p>For those of you who are wondering, Lolth is another deity from forgotten realms, she is a chaotic evil being, she is worshipped by evil drow (dark elves who live underground), she is considered to be probably the most chaotic being in the forgotten realms pantheon. Somehow, it just seemed appropriate to mention her in this story.<p>If you can't figure out who the Amazon on the ship is, you need a very painful reeducation on the subject of the Ranmaverse.<p>Loki has also been introduced and seems to get along with Ranma and Akane, what could this mean for the future of the two of them. Will Loki be dropping by in the future to check up on the two or will he merely watch as he's done before.<p>Soon the cast will be assembled, the players on stage and the story can really progress to the real action.<p>All this on more on the next chapter, same Ranma time (hopefully) same Ranma channel.<p>I hope everyone is enjoying this story. If you are, then please review and tell me what you thought of this, I am always searching for comments on my writing and how I can improve it. If you have anything to say at all, please review. The reviews are one of the things that keep me going, especially the reviews that offer advice and/or criticism. I welcome all reviews though, but please try to keep flames to a minimum.<p>Hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
