</div>One Last Chance ch.5<p>****Fights of Fancy****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter Akane and Ranma went to school met Kuno, beat Kuno, beat Kuno, beat Kuno, then tied him to a bed and with Nabiki's help explained to Kuno that Ranma and Akane were in love and that he had been beaten soundly by Ranma. The two then decided to go on their first real date for both their lives.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo House ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Boy, where do you think you are going dressed like that?"<p>"You're not going out with some girl are you son?"<p>Ranma was jumped at the bottom of the stairs by Genma and Soun.<p>"Sure I am Mr. Tendo, a very nice girl at that, one I'll marry someday."<p>Genma reeled backwards in horror while Soun gathered himself to perform the demon head attack on his unfaithful potential son-in-law.<p>"Ranma, are you ready to go?" Akane called from the top of the stairs.<p>The three men at the bottom of the stairs turned to look up. Akane stood dressed in a form fitting sleeveless black dress, the legs had slits running a good ways up her legs allowing for easier movement, or fighting since it is Nerima, a red dragon design highlighted in gold wrapped around her body, leading the eye. The head of the dragon rested upon her right breast with its neck and body flowing over her shoulder and down her back where its tail was wrapped around her waist.<p>Ranma stood before the bottom step; he was dressed in black pants and a red Chinese shirt, much like the ones he regularly wore, but this one added an air of formality and refinement. A white dragon design highlighted in gold had its head starting on Ranma's left breast, went over his shoulder and down his back to wrap around his waist.<p>The couple's clothes were almost exact matches and complemented each other perfectly. The two just stood there looking at the other, each felt they could look at the other for eternity; unfortunately eternity has no place for Mr. Waterworks and Panda-man.<p>"Boy, where did you get those clothes?"<p>"Akane, when did you get that dress?"<p>Their fathers just had to interrupt the romantic scene.<p>"It was just there in my pack/closet," the two answered at once.<p>The pair traded surprised looks, and just shrugged; it wasn't like this was the strangest or most unwanted thing that had happened to the pair. At least this time it was something good that happened to them, why look a gift horse in the mouth.<p>Ranma held his arm out to Akane, who came down the stairs and took the offered limb.<p>"Son, you show my daughter a good time." Soun slapped some yen into Ranma's hand, which he then forced the younger martial artist to pocket.<p>"Don't worry Mr. Tendo; I'll have her back at a reasonable time."<p>"Tomorrow evening is a good time boy," Genma held out two seals, "and if you feel like eloping you have my full approval."<p>"Pop," Ranma growled.<p>Akane dragged him out the door before their fathers could say anything else. As they watched their children go out the gate Soun moved over to slap Genma on the back.<p>"My daughter is growing up." Soun was ecstatic<p>"And then the schools will be united." Genma also shared his best friend's exuberance by slapping his friend's back, laughing all the while.<p>"Right you are Saotome; it makes an old man's heart weep."<p>"Say, whatever happened to the family seals I had?"<p>"Forgetful as ever, you probably just put them down somewhere, now how about a game of Shogi?"<p>"Right then Tendo, hope you're ready to lose?"<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"This has never happened before."<p>"What?"<p>"This, think about it, the only time we had peace was before Shampoo arrived."<p>"What about Ryoga and Kuno?"<p>"Kuno only really bothered us at school; he spent the rest of his time contemplating how to win you and the pigtailed girl. As for Ryoga, my fights with Ryoga didn't really become too regular or intense till Shampoo arrived."<p>Akane's face took on a contemplative expression at Ranma's words.<p>"And why was that?"<p>"Well you used to tell P-chan about any and every little thing I did that made you angry, and so he'd come after me to make me pay." Ranma saw Akane tense up a little and put his arm around her.<p>Reminding her just who P-chan was, wasn't the best of ideas. Akane moved close to Ranma, cuddling into him slightly. Ranma felt it best to change the topic of conversation.<p>"We're quite the pair aren't we Akane, look how easy it is for us to make people fall in love with us."<p>"Huh?" Akane couldn't quite see what Ranma was getting at.<p>"Well for starters, you hit Toma and he fell in love with you."<p>Akane elbowed her fiancée gently.<p>"Well you beat up Shampoo and she's in love with you."<p>"Not yet and hopefully not ever, she is still trying to kill me after all."<p>Ranma shivered a little at the thought of Shampoo<p>"Don't forget about Ukyo, she wanted you dead, you called her cute and all was forgiven."<p>"What about Ryoga, you were nice to him in pig form and he became completely obsessed about you."<p>"Let's not forget the one guy we both beat into loving us."<p>The two shuddered at Akane's reminder.<p>"Kuno," they both uttered together, shuddering slightly before laughing.<p>"So when did you figure out you were in love with me, Akane?"<p>"I think I first began to think about my feelings for you was when you protected me from Sanzenin and called me your fiancée in front of everyone at the martial arts figure skating competition. How about you, when did you come to love me?"<p>Ranma gave a slight chuckle before replying.<p>"I was yours' from, 'Hi I'm Akane, want to be friends?' that was the nicest thing I had ever heard. I think that and your smile were what made me fall in love with you."<p>Akane spun in his arms so they were facing each other. She favored her fiancée with a smile before leaning in to kiss him.<p>"Mmmmh, I came for the smile, I'll stay for the kisses."<p>Ranma wrapped her in an embrace. She rested her head on his chest, listening to his heart beat.<p>"This night has been so perfect. I just know something or somebody is going to ruin it."<p>Ranma tightened his hold on Akane as he heard her words.<p>"Even if that happens, at least we've had a nice evening together so far. Nobody tried to poison, magic, or drug either of us."<p>"No fiancées, enemies, or rivals showing up to steal or kidnap you or me."<p>The two were practically singing by this point.<p>"No kidnappers stealing my fiancée."<p>"No challenges for my fiancée by overpowered martial artists."<p>They finished together, "best of all, NO MORE KUNO!"<p>They laughed together as they walked through the park. There were other couples together, but they tended to ignore the others, lost in each other as they were.<p>The night had been perfect to his point, the Chinese restaurant while not as good as the Nekohanten, was infinitely safer.<p>They went to see a movie; unfortunately the only interesting movie playing had been a Bruce Lee movie they'd both seen several times, but this time was much more enjoyable then the other times since they were watching it together openly as a couple.<p>The two had decided to finish off the evening with a walk through the park. It had been pretty uneventful, except for the one mugger who'd made the mistake of trying to attack Akane. She had thought he was just a pervert trying to grab her and gave him a beating. When Ranma pointed out he had been trying to rob them she had twisted him into a remarkable likeness of a human pretzel. Feeling sorry for the guy Ranma had merely punted him towards the police station with a note attached to him.<p>"I think we should take a training trip together."<p>Ranma's words broke the comfortable silence which had settled.<p>"Why?"<p>"Well, we're still not used to these bodies yet so we should take a trip to help them get up to par for when the others start showing up. We have a week before Ryoga arrives, so we might as well take advantage of the situation."<p>"What about our parents?"<p>"You're right Akane; they were so opposed to our date tonight that we had to sneak out. I'm sure they will oppose any chance for us to get closer."<p>"Baka," Akane replied, gently elbowing him in the stomach again, "we can leave the day after tomorrow and then be back the day before he gets here, that will give us a good four days to train."<p>Ranma nodded in agreement.<p>"Come on, let's head home, otherwise our fathers might think we really have eloped. Want to roof hop?"<p>"Nope."<p>Akane smiled and took a step backwards from he fiancée. Ranma quirked his eyebrow and was about to ask what she wanted to do instead when she leapt into his arms, which instantly moved to cradle her.<p>"Now we can roof hop."<p>Ranma smiled at his fiancée's words as she snuggled into him. He took off running, bouncing off a wall onto a roof and began running for home. The two laughed a little, but spent most of the run home just enjoying each other's presence in silence. The landed just inside the walls of the Tendo compound.<p>"Thank you Ranma, I had a really good time tonight."<p>"Not as good a time as I had," Ranma returned with a cocky grin.<p>The two walked to the front door bantering back and forth on who had the better date. Kasumi met them at the door.<p>"Oh my, don't you two look nice."<p>Akane and Ranma blushed at the compliment.<p>"Father and Mr. Saotome would like to see you two right away."<p>"Okay Kasumi, we'll go see them right now."<p>If there is a priest in there with them they are dead meat. The same thought crossed both Akane and Ranma's minds.<p>The couple followed Kasumi into the house to find their fathers sitting at the table with a man and a woman who were sitting with them on the adjacent side of the table from their parents.<p>Well at least it's not a priest. Ranma and Akane shared yet another thought.<p>As Ranma and Akane walked in the couple turned and gave an appraising look and a smile to them. The two fiancées sat opposite the pair and examined them. The two looked very much like brother and sister if not twins.<p>The woman was wearing a light blue kimono with stylized waves on it. Her eyes were a deep ocean blue; her hair was black, long and flowing.<p>The man was dressed in a red dress shirt and black pants. His hair was cut short and fiery red, very similar to Ranma's female form. His eyes were a very dark brown, almost black.<p>"You are Ranma Saotome, son of Genma Saotome?" The woman asked looking at Ranma.<p>"You are Akane Tendo, youngest daughter of Soun Tendo?" The man asked looking at Akane.<p>The pair nodded in response to the two questions.<p>"And who might you be?" Queried Akane.<p>"I am Miura Kusaragi and this is my twin brother Kyushin Kusaragi. We are your fiancées."<p>"WHAT?" Ranma and Akane yelled in response.<p>"As per the arrangement your fathers made with our father years ago, I am engaged to Genma Saotome's son, that would be you Ranma, and my brother is engaged to the youngest daughter of Soun Tendo, that would be you Akane."<p>"Sorry, but we are already engaged to each other."<p>"Do you love each other?"<p>"Yes," they replied together, speaking as one without a moment's hesitation, Akane slipping her hand into Ranma's, who gave the offered limb a reassuring squeeze.<p>"Then there's no problem."<p>"Really?"<p>It had never been this easy to get rid of a fiancée before, maybe their luck was changing for the better this time round.<p>"Sure, my brother and I aren't adverse to sharing, especially if you really are cursed as your father keeps saying."<p>A group face fault ensued, along with a disgusted Ranma resisting the urge to vomit as he shuddered at the suggestion.<p>"You can't be serious."<p>"Of course we are."<p>Akane leveled her gaze across the table, "then we challenge you to a martial arts match. If you lose, you give up your engagement to us."<p>"Very well, but if you lose, you give up your engagement to each other."<p>"Fine you're on."<p>The four stood up and headed for the dojo. Ranma put his hand on Akane's shoulder and held her back a moment.<p>"Don't try and stop me Ranma, we're doing this together. If you try and stop me, I will make you hurt."<p>Ranma backed away from his fiancée's glare.<p>"Umm, I was just going to say you might want to change. You look so beautiful in that dress, I'd hate for anything to happen to that dress before you got to wear it again."<p>"You're not going to try and stop me from fighting?" Akane asked, an underlying threat clearly present in her voice<p>"Nope, wouldn't do me any good anyways, besides, we could both use the training these two will give us in the match."<p>Akane stepped up and kissed Ranma on the lips.<p>"mmmh, what was that for, not that I mind of course."<p>"For being such a kind loveable baka."<p>She ran upstairs to change, followed closely by Ranma.<p>They split at the top of the stairs, each heading for their own rooms.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dojo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Are you ready?"<p>"We are ready."<p>The Kusaragi twins had also changed into new outfits.<p>Miura was wearing a blue bodysuit very similar in design to the Kimono she had on earlier.<p>Kyushin wore a similar bodysuit to Miura's, but his was red and looked more like his original clothing.<p>"Are you ready?"<p>Ranma glanced to Akane who was in turn looking at him. He gave her a reassuring smile and was rewarded with one of her own.<p>"We're ready."<p>Soun and Genma were watching from the sidelines, where they had been tied up so as not to be tempted to interfere in the match.<p>Nabiki was conducting the fight and acting as referee.<p>"The stakes of this match are the engagements of the two parties. Should Ranma and Akane win the Kusaragi twins will give up their claims of engagement to Ranma and Akane. Should the Kusaragi twins win, Ranma and Akane will give up their engagement to each other. Do both parties and all four involved agree to these terms and conditions?"<p>Four affirmatives were her response.<p>She dropped her raised hand to start the fight.<p>"Begin."<p>Ranma and Akane were thrown back against the dojo walls a few moments later.<p>Akane was chilled to the bone while Ranma felt like he was on fire.<p>"What was that?" he barked out, wincing at the pain.<p>"My sister and I are heirs to the all out school of elemental art. We have trained so that we can use our ki to adjust the temperature of the environment around us and make attacks out of it. My sister uses cold ki while I use hot ki."<p>Ranma and Akane had picked themselves off the ground while Kyushin was talking and were standing side-by-side, back into their stances.<p>"Akane," Ranma said, just loud enough for Akane to hear, but none of the others.<p>"Yeah Ranma," Akane replied at the same volume.<p>"Generate a battle aura, get angry."<p>"What?"<p>Ranma inwardly cursed, he knew he was going to pay for this later, but it was better then losing Akane completely.<p>"Jeez you uncute tomboy, I should have known better then to rely on you in this fight. You're too slow, can't kick, built like a brick, thighs are too thick, a real macho chick. I don't even know what I saw in you in the first place. Maybe I should get engaged to Miura."<p>Ranma forced himself into the soul of ice to say those things to Akane, but it still hurt. The look of betrayal and hurt that Akane was giving him was amongst the worst things he'd ever known in his lives, and coming from somebody who had been thrown into a pit of cats and lived through his own death that was saying something.<p>Akane could barely hold back her tears at Ranma's words.<p>I thought he said he loved me, I was stupid to think a chauvinistic womanizer like him would care for me and stay with me.<p>"Can we please continue this match please, I'd like to get to know my fiancée better."<p>A huge red aura bloomed around Akane as Miura discovered the worst time to speak.<p>Like hell if I'll let her take him away from me. He's mine, I love him and I will make him love me.<p>The floor Akane was standing on began to darken and smoke around her feet at the heat she was giving off from her fiery red aura.<p>The air around Ranma began to slow down as a chill took over and a dark blue aura developed. He had dropped into the soul of ice for the battle.<p>Soul of ice, hell Akane hates me now. Soul of liquid nitrogen. I might have just killed my chances with the woman I love just for the sake of a fight. Soul of absolute zero.<p>The Kusaragi twins stared at their fiancées. The auras that their opponents were giving off almost perfectly matched their own respective techniques. These two were perfect mates.<p>Miura sent out a freezing blast at Akane while Kyushin sent a burning wave at Ranma.<p>Kyushin's fiery wave fizzled out before it even came close to Ranma while Miura's own freezing blast steamed away as it came near Akane's aura, not even coming near to the very angry girl.<p>The two martial artists began to circle the twins, staying on opposite sides of the circle, like polar opposites.<p>Back to back the twins also turned, keeping their opponents in front of them. The air in the dojo swirled, going faster and faster.<p>Akane and Ranma yelled together, "frozen flames technique, whirlpool crusher."<p>As one the two punched forwards towards the twins. The winds of the dojo raced inwards at the two in the center, buffeting them in hot and cold air, alternating so quickly that neither twin could adjust their ki fast enough to compensate and only increased the torrent of air around them.<p>Ranma and Akane rode on the outer wind currents receiving only a slight buffeting at the winds they had caused.<p>Soon the twins collapsed in the middle of the dojo, killing the center of the vortex and dispelling the cyclone.<p>Ranma and Akane also collapsed to their knees, shaking in fear, but not because of the duel.<p>The Kusaragi twins lay groaning and unconscious, but otherwise okay at the center of the dojo, their bodies covered in bruises.<p>"The winners are Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo, the Kusaragi engagement is broken."<p>Nabiki's mouth was dry as she spoke. She had never seen something like that match outside of TV, the movies, or even Anime. She walked over to Genma and her father and untied them.<p>"Take the Kusaragi twins to the house," she instructed, pointing to the unconscious and bruised duo.<p>The fathers, also amazed at what they had just seen their children do, dumbly and mechanically complied with Nabiki's command.<p>After the others had left it was just Akane and Ranma. The two hadn't moved since they had been deposited on the ground by the wind.<p>Akane couldn't hold back her tears any longer and began to cry. Ranma heard this and moved over to her.<p>As Ranma came close to her, Akane threw her arms around him and cried into his shoulder.<p>"No," she whispered forcefully.<p>Ranma wrapped his arms around her and let her cry.<p>"I won't let you."<p>"Won't let me what?"<p>"I won't let you go, you are mine."<p>"I thought you'd hate me."<p>"I love you and I will win your heart and never let it go, nobody will take you away from me."<p>"You're right Akane, no one will, I love you."<p>Akane pulled back from him, looking confused, "but what you said to me during the fight?"<p>Ranma pulled Akane back into a passionate hug, the tears he was shedding falling onto her shoulder.<p>"I said those things so you would generate an aura, I didn't mean any of those things, I did it so we'd win and stay engaged to each other."<p>"Baka."<p>"I know I am, I love you and always will."<p>"I love you too."<p>"Akane."<p>She shushed him, "don't ruin this."<p>Ranma grinned.<p>"Only if you kiss me."<p>Akane giggled.<p>"Only if you kiss me back."<p>"Deal."<p>Their lips met in a passionate kiss, neither one wanting to let go of the one they thought had been lost.<p>Outside the dojo, Nabiki slid the door shut silently. She had cracked it open slightly and looked through after everyone had left.<p>Now as she walked towards the house, she tried to think of a way to keep their fathers away from the dojo.<p>She shrugged; in a situation like this always go with something simple.<p>Peeking around the door to the living room where Soun, Genma, and Kasumi who was treating the two twins were.<p>"Akane and Ranma are talking in the dojo about the match and other things. If anyone decides to eavesdrop, Akane promises to cook dinner for a week."<p>At the horrified expressions on their faces, well the faces of those who were conscious at least, Nabiki safely concluded the two were safe for now.<p>With a yawn she went upstairs to get some sleep, putting this on Ranma and Akane's now rapidly growing tab. She did have to say that things were getting a lot more interesting with her future brother-in-law around the house.<p>She considered giving the two of them a discount, but then realized what she had been thinking and promised herself to charge Kuno twice the normal amount she usually did for pictures of Akane.<p>Hmm, I wonder if he'd be interested in pictures of Ranma's girl half.  Was Nabiki's last thought before she drifted off to sleep.<p>Unseen by the rest of the household, a beautiful golden glow had filled the dojo where Ranma and Akane still were.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"AWWWW, isn't that so cute, the two have fought off their first challenge together. It really tugs at you heart doesn't it?"<p>A figure sitting in a very comfortable chair turned away from watching his two favorite martial artists.<p>"Truly, if one were moved by such touching displays then you would be correct."<p>A cloaked figure turned its back on the display to face the seated figure which it was spending so much time with nowadays.<p>"Well those twins didn't turn out to be too much of a distraction, although it was fun to watch the two when they thought the other had stopped caring, I think we need more of those scenes."<p>"It will take some time for the next opportunity to get those two apart to come along. Their relationship if anything is probably going to become more intense after this battle, and with them going off like they are we won't be able to use those simpleton parents like before."<p>"Then what would be the best course of action to take, I really don't like the idea of those two with no distractions being alone for almost a week."<p>The cloaked figure pulled out another folder like so many others that it had previously pulled out.<p>"Well if that is what you really want I do believe we can find a way to kick it up a notch."<p>"How so?" The seated figures interest had been piqued by another chance to cause trouble for the soon to be ex-fiancées.<p>"Well, while they will be away from their parents there are other things out there that can be turned to our advantage."<p>The seated figure looked at the folder and a chuckled.<p>"I think this will do quite nicely."<p>The two figures laughed.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ END of chapter 5, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Christmas is coming, It's about time at that, Pleased to put a review in an author's hat, If you haven't a review some kind words will do, If you haven't got some kind words I don't want to hear from you.<p>Well that's another chapter done, things start picking up from here and hopefully since school is out now I can concentrate more of my time onto updating this story.<p>People are constantly comparing this too other fanfic that deal with going back in time, I have also been told that this has already been done before, one of the most popular comparisons is "Second Chances" a very good fic that I looked at and "Once More From The Top". Every time someone has said I am copying someone's fic I go and compare the two. So far except for the death and going back in time part I haven't seen all that many similarities. Admittedly I didn't get the inspiration to do this until after I had read second chances, that and I wanted to see if I'd be the first one to actually finish my back in time fic since the others seem to taper off and not update any more.<p>Let me also point out that my fic differs from both the aforementioned fics in that in Second chances, Only Akane goes back and has a very different personality, and then in Once more, Nabiki, Ranma, and Akane all head back in time. In mine it is merely the two main characters. I actually scraped one idea I had for part of the fic because it came too close to another for comforts.<p>So could people please stop constantly comparing me with these two fics.<p>It seems people are getting more and more interested in the two figures that I include at the end of the chapters, well I'd tell you, but that would spoil the surprise, maybe I'll reveal their identities as a Christmas present.<p>Thank you for the reviews I have received, they are a very big driving force in writing this fanfic. The more I write, the more reviews I get, the more reviews I get the more I want to continue this story. So as long as I have more people who want me to continue this story then people who don't want me to continue, I will keep writing One Last Chance.<p>As always feel free to write a review, C&amp;C is welcome, if you wish to talk to me personally feel free to E-mail me at  and I will try to respond as promptly as possible.<p>Hope you enjoyed the story so far, more coming soon.<p>Rhuobhe26
