</div>One Last Chance ch.16<p>`<p>**** The Duty of Mother ****<p>`<p>`<p>`<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>`<p>`<p>`<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>`<p>` ` ` ` Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. Nabiki is now stuck in an engagement to Kuno. When he returned home, Ranma encountered his mother waiting there for him. Things might be looking even worse for our pigtailed martial arts hero right now. Ranma discussed his training trip with his mother, telling her about what he had been doing over the past decade. Meanwhile at her campsite Shampoo encountered someone. Akane and Ranma were ready to tell his mother about his curse when fate intervened and he got hit with a glass of water. Thankfully it was warm water and he didn't change. Unfortunately the water Akane tossed immediately afterwards was cold and revealed Ranma's curse. ` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo House, Evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` ` "Ranma will you please go and fetch the necessary implements. It is time for you to be judged," Tempered steel was nothing compared to Nodoka's voice.<p>Ranma unable to think on his own mechanically stood up and went to get the required objects for what could very well be the end of his re-life.<p>Akane was still slumped against the doorframe in shock over having revealed Ranma's curse inadvertently to his mother without being able to properly warn her.<p>As Ranma walked by Akane, the young Tendo shot her fiancée a pleading look, asking him not to go through with this. Upon seeing Ranma's face Akane knew that he'd go through with it. Nothing was more important to Ranma than his honour and mother. If his mother asked him to kill himself for the sake of honour Ranma would more than likely do it.<p>Ranma disappeared round the corner after lightly brushing his hand over her shoulder reassuringly. Akane shuddered to think that might be the last time she'd get to feel his touch.<p>Nodoka saw Akane shuddering at the thing, which claimed to be her son, and realized this was the right choice. No woman should be forced to wed such an abomination and it was clear that this girl was being forced into such a marriage against her will.<p>"Don't worry Akane-chan, you needn't worry," Nodoka soothingly told the girl.<p>Akane turned from where she had watched Ranma trudge away to face the Saotome matriarch. Nodoka's words struck Akane and a glimmer of hope surfaced.<p>"Really Auntie, then, you mean . . ." Akane left the words hanging in the air, not quite able to say the words.<p>"Yes, once that cursed individual who calls himself my son commits seppuku to redeem his honour you will be released from this unwanted marriage."<p>"No, no, no," Akane exclaimed, "that's not what I meant, this marriage isn't unwanted, and I want to marry Ranma."<p>Nodoka smiled at the young girl who was pleading for her fiancée's life, it was obvious that even though the girl wanted to be free from the engagement she was upholding her honour by acting the way a proper fiancée should.<p>"I'm sorry dear, but to keep his honour Ranma must perform seppuku like he promised."<p>The temper, which Akane had restrained while Ranma was in the room began to come back full force.<p>"Ranma didn't make that promise, for the love of god, look at the promise, Ranma's handprints are all over it. He wasn't making a promise; it looks like he was finger-painting. How can you try and hold Ranma to such a stupid promise made by his father while he was an infant," Akane had moved across the room and was glaring at Nodoka over the table.<p>Nodoka's only response was to lean back slightly when Akane first raised her voice and stalked across the room.<p>"A promise must be kept even if Ranma can't remember the promise," Nodoka began to state calmly, but was cut off by Akane.<p>"Ranma didn't even know he was swearing to this, there's no way he could have understood what you expected of him."<p>Nodoka narrowed her eyes at the girl across from her. Akane was now seeming less and less like what Nodoka had originally thought, and more like a person standing in the way of honour and duty.<p>"You have no right to interfere in this. This is a promise within the Saotome clan and you have no part in this."<p>"As Ranma's fiancée I have every right, I'm not going to let you kill your son because of something that he can't control after having only talked to him for a couple of hours."<p>Nodoka's hand unconsciously strayed to the Saotome honour blade, an action that did not escape Akane's notice.<p>Before she could even blink Nodoka found a very sharp tanto held against her throat by Akane.<p>"Akane, what are you doing," Nodoka asked, shocked by both the girl's actions and her speed.<p>"I love Ranma, and I will not let anyone take him away from me again. That includes you mother-in-law," Akane said the last words with an impressive amount of venom.<p>"You'd kill me for my son," Nodoka asked in a guarded tone.<p>"I'd kill you in a heartbeat if it meant saving Ranma," Akane's grave but determined tone proved just how serious she was as she pulled the blade closer to Nodoka's throat. ` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ranma's room, Tendo house ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` ` Ranma slid open the door to the room he and his father shared at the Tendo home.<p>As he stepped into the room he had lived for the past 2 weeks/ 2 years, the pigtailed martial artist couldn't help but wonder just how much longer he would be living in this room.<p>There were three likely changes that would happen in time. The first and most hopeful was that he would eventually move into Akane's room when she became his wife. Second he'd be in this room for another two years stuck with his father. Tertiary and the least enjoyable would be that before the night was out his body would be in a pine box with his head seemingly attached by a silk scarf.<p>Ranma really hoped that the last option was not the case. He enjoyed his head where it was.<p>A backpack thrown at him interrupted Ranma from his introspection. Ranma reached out and caught the pack just before it would have hit him in the face.<p>"Come on boy, we're getting out of here now," Genma growled as he hefted his own pack.<p>Ranma too stunned to speak looked around the room he and his father shared. It was barren, even more so than usual. What little the two Saotomes possessed had been removed from the room and placed into the two well-worn packs.<p>"What do you think you're doing pop," Ranma growled right back at his father while dropping his pack back onto the floor.<p>"Simple my boy, I'm watching out for your best interests. Now that your mother knows about your shameful secret she will carry out the pact which we pledged to so long ago." Genma inwardly smirked, there was no way the boy would be willing to get his head chopped off. True they might not be able to come back to the Tendo Dojo, but Genma had gotten good enough at selling off his son that he was sure to be able to set up some other deal where he could live the good life off of the boy.<p>"I know you don't want to leave here, but surely you can see it is for the best," Genma tried to cajole Ranma into agreeing with him.<p>"What about Akane, what about your promise to unite the schools, what about the promise to mom you made before she let you take me off on a ten year training trip so that you could teach me martial arts so that I could marry Akane and unite the schools and be a man for mom?"<p>"I never really expected to have to go through with the whole commit seppuku promise boy and I never intended too. We would have been fine if you hadn't fallen into that cursed pool," the gaping flaw in Genma's logic was enough to stun Ranma for a few moments, more than enough time for Genma to launch himself into an attack in the hopes of subduing his son/meal ticket and making a break for it.<p>The elder Saotome's plan met with complete and utter failure as the younger Saotome casually blocked Genma's assault and planted a fist into the face of his father.<p>"Bad move old man," Ranma replied and then proceeded to demonstrate just why Genma's plan had been such a bad idea in an incredibly painful and gratuitous beat down that left one Saotome feeling oddly refreshed and at peace while the other was left whimpering on the floor in a mangled heap. Three guesses as to which Saotome is the one, which is on the floor whimpering, and if any one of those guesses is Ranma then you have less common sense than a Kuno.<p>Ranma pulling a piece of rope out of his pack began to hog-tie the mangled Genma. Since Genma's new form could pass for modern art Ranma had no problem creating a very secure set of knots that would keep his cowardly father in place until he got back from talking with his mother.<p>For good measure Ranma decided he might as well gag Genma while he was at it, four pairs of rolled up socks later and a new loop of the rope and Ranma was satisfied with his handiwork.<p>"Listen up pops and listen good. I am nothing like you and I never want to be anything like you, I am going down there to face my judgment and you're going to do the same."<p>Having said his piece Ranma retrieved an extra tanto and robes for his father.<p>"Time to face the music old man, if you believe in the gods I'd start praying."<p>Ranma found his own words particularly funny, especially since he knew that gods existed, as did magic, dragons, demons, ghosts, curses, and a number of other things that would get him committed to a mental hospital anywhere, but Nerima. and possibly Juban or California.<p>Ranma grabbed his bundled up father by the scruff of his neck and began dragging him from the room and heading for the stairs.<p>` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Living room, Tendo house ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<p>Looking into her eyes, Nodoka could see the determination in them and knew without a shadow of a doubt that this young girl would willingly slice her throats with hardly a second thought if it meant protecting her fiancée.<p>The gaze of grim determination on Akane's face changed to one of shock and surprise as Nodoka swept her into a hug. This was very surprising considering the fact that both of them had been kneeling, with a table between them, and Akane had been holding a razor sharp tanto to the older woman's neck.<p>"Very well Akane," Nodoka said, placing the young girl back on the ground and giving her back the tanto, "You have convinced me not to be so hasty in my decisions. I will postpone my judgment of Ranma until a later time. I will show myself out, please tell my so-Ranma that I will see him another time and we will talk more then."<p>Akane was shocked into immobility by the older woman's change of heart.<p>Nodoka seeing Akane to surprised to reply turned and began to leave.<p>Nodoka stopped as a tanto blade appeared in front of her, quivering as it stuck into the wall right before her eyes.<p>"I don't think you understand Mrs. Saotome. This entire contract is a travesty and I will not let you carry it out under any circumstances. Ranma is more of a man than any other person I know. Try and make Ranma commit seppuku and I will make you regret it."<p>Nodoka turned to look Akane straight in the eyes.<p>"No, you understand little girl, this is a clan matter of family honour. I have given my SON a reprieve from his judgment, but it is his duty to eventually face my judgment as his mother. Not you, not Genma, not even the Kami will prevent me from doing my duty. Know this little girl, your threats mean nothing to me. I am giving Ranma a reprieve out of respect for your feelings and tenacity."<p>Nodoka whirled away from Akane, breaking eye contact she stormed past the tanto still embedded in the wall.<p>Twirling around Nodoka grabbed the tanto and threw it back at Akane where it embedded itself into the ground at the young Tendo's feet.<p>"Do you think your threatening me with death means anything. If I did judge my son unmanly then I would follow him and my husband into the afterlife as soon as my duty as their second was fulfilled. I am sorry you were brought into a family matter such as this, but make no mistake if you get in the way of my duty to my clan's honour again I will not be as forgiving."<p>Seeing no response forthcoming from Akane Nodoka once again turned to leave.<p>"Don't worry about me, I will show myself out," done saying her piece and sure that the girl was too stunned to try anything while her back was turned Nodoka left the Tendo residence.<p>Akane heard the Saotome matriarch leave, but was unable to do anything but stare at the Tanto quivering in the floor inches in front of her big toe.<p>She just stood there watching the hilt of the tanto rocking back and forth, watching the hilt of the weapon as if it was the most important object in existence.<p>"Akane?"<p>And that's how Ranma found her when he came down the stairs carrying the tools he'd need for the ceremony and dragging a fat whimpering old man behind him.<p>Akane looked over to see her fiancée coming down the stairs. All the pent up tension and adrenalin she had been suppressing burst forwards. The youngest Tendo collapsed as the tension of the moment combined with the exhaustion from the day finally caught up with the girl.<p>Ranma was at her side and caught her before she was halfway done with her fall. Of course this left Genma, whom Ranma had been dragging without a support allowing him to take a not so pleasant tumble down the stairs to end up in a heap at the bottom of the stairs.<p>"Pops your going to pay for this mess," Ranma growled.<p>Genma could only whimper in reply.<p>"We're home, oh my, what happened here?"<p>` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Midnight, Ranma's room ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<p>Ranma lay in bed for a while thinking about what had happened during the day. After his mother's visit Akane had chosen the moment before Kasumi arrived home to collapse. Ranma and Kasumi had carried her upstairs and put the young girl to bed.<p>Akane had gripped tightly to Ranma while he carried her up the stairs. Kasumi had shooed a blushing Ranma out of the room while Kasumi changed Akane into one of her pairs of pajamas. She had allowed Ranma to say goodnight to his fiancée's sleeping form before hustling him out of the room.<p>Rather than letting him go to his room and go to sleep the eldest Tendo had asked Ranma to stay up and talk with her. Since there was nobody on the face of the earth who could refuse Kasumi when she really wanted something, Ranma of course accepted her gracious invitation.<p>In the kitchen, Ranma had explained to Kasumi what had happened earlier over some tea, or at least as much as he knew. ` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flashback ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<p>After putting Akane to bed Kasumi had taken Ranma into the kitchen, taking the very sharp tanto from his hand and putting it away in a cupboard where it was out of sight and hopefully out of mind.<p>"Ranma-kun, what happened, did the meeting with your mother go well," Kasumi asked as she went around the kitchen while a pot of tea boiled. Although it was obvious by her tone and the worried look in her eyes that she realized things hadn't gone as well as she had hoped. "It didn't go well did it?"<p>Ranma thankfully took the cup of tea Kasumi placed in front of him. Taking a sip he let the tea made by Kasumi's skilful touch ease some of his stress. Ranma quickly drained the cup only to have it refilled by a waiting Kasumi.<p>"Thank you Kasumi, Akane would know better than I would, but my curse was revealed to her before I had prepared her for it"<p>Ranma stopped talking for a moment to allow Kasumi to throw in an, "Oh My," before continuing.<p>"She instructed me to go fetch my tanto and prepare myself," Ranma didn't show a hint of emotion as he told Kasumi the events of the evening, "So I went upstairs to get it. Pop tried to stop me and make me run away with him. I didn't want to run and leave Akane and my honour so I convinced him to stay."<p>Kasumi nodded as another piece of the puzzle fell into place.<p>"Oh, Mr. Saotome, would you care for some tea," Kasumi asked.<p>The person, currently panda, Kasumi asked the question to was unable to respond as he was bound too tightly to reply with a sign, so he just whimpered an affirmative.<p>Unfortunately for Genma, Kasumi didn't speak panda and so she mistakenly thought Genma was politely refusing her offer.<p>"Then when I came down the stairs, I saw Akane standing there with the tanto stuck in the ground and mom was gone."<p>Kasumi just nodded; surprised that Ranma seemed to take this so well. A shiver going down her back made her make a mental note to check the heating system, it shouldn't be this cold in the kitchen.<p>"Well if you excuse me Kasumi, I've had a long day and I'm going to bed, school tomorrow and all." Finished with the conversation Ranma left the room heading for his futon and a night of sleep.<p>Ranma was almost to the top of the stairs when he turned around and stalked back into the kitchen.<p>"Good night Kasumi, I hope you sleep well."<p>Ranma then hoisted his panda father over his shoulder and carried Genma back up to their shared room.<p>` ` ` `<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flash Forwards ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<p>It had been quite a day starting with Ryoga and his vendetta and ending with his mother and the seppuku pact which he was honour bound to fill.<p>With all these thoughts on his mind Ranma fell asleep, curiously enough there was a nagging thought in the pig-tailed martial-artist's mind that he was forgetting something, but already tired in the extreme, Ranma dismissed it and drifted off to sleep, welcoming the dark nothingness of dreams.<p>Unknown to Ranma a dark figure slipped into his room and made its way over to Ranma's bed.<p>"Ranma for what you've done to me you will pay," The shadowy figure declared while standing above the sleeping body of the previously stated sleeping martial artist.<p>Ryoga punched towards Ranma, trying to extract his revenge. Ranma rolled over and avoided his punch. Ryoga tried again only to have his pigtailed nemesis roll over, avoiding yet another strike for vengeance.<p>After a few moments of thought the just punisher decided that it would be best to wake his archenemy up so that he could extract his revenge on an awake target that would hopefully be easier to hit.<p>Ryoga glanced around the room and saw nothing out of the ordinary from a regular room besides the sparseness of the furnishings, the two large backpacks against one wall, a panda that appeared to be hog-tied, a small desk with a lamp on it, and a. wait a minute, a panda?<p>Ryoga turned his head back and saw a real bruised panda hogtied, gagged, and stuffed into a corner. Ryoga's temper began to rise again.<p>"So Ranma not only do you run from our fight and make my life hell, but you also abuse harmless animals." Ryoga made his loud declaration and turned to hear whatever weak excuses his for would give.<p>Ranma's only response was a snore before rolling over and snuggling into his sheets. Ryoga sweat dropped at the sight of his opponent completely ignoring him.<p>Ryoga took a step forwards when a chill ran down his spine, ran up it again, and then slid back down just for an extra shiver. He looked around, but couldn't see anything in the room. Ryoga allowed his eyes to drift once more across the room.<p>To the naked eye there was nothing different in the room, but Ryoga had felt the change. Of course he really wanted to punish Ranma now so that he could get on with his life so Ryoga ignored that little feeling that most people would call caution and decided to get on with Ranma's punishment.<p>"Ranma, get up," Ryoga said. He prodded the pig-tailed martial artist with his foot a few times, but didn't receive any response from the sleeping body.<p>"RANMA WAKE UP SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PUNISHMENT LIKE A MAN."<p>Ryoga tried to kick Ranma with enough force to wake his sleeping nemesis up, but his target rolled out of the way at just the right moment.<p>Ryoga bent down and leaned close to Ranma's ear, sucking in a lungful of air.<p>"RRRRAAAAANNNNNNMMMMMMAAAAAAA!"<p>The pigtailed martial artist sat straight up like a shot.<p>"Huh, wha? who?" Ranma managed to ask looking around bleary eyed. He had been having such a nice dream, Akane had been there and he had rolled over so he could hold her in his arms, listening to her soft rhythmic breathing, and feeling the soft beating of her heart.<p>Then she was calling his name, and now he was sitting up with no Akane, but oh look, there's Ryoga. He's probably here to avenge Akane's honour for some slight or another.<p>"I'm not in the mood for this tonight Ryoga, I've had a long day, and I just want to sleep. This is your only warning."<p>Ryoga made a few mistakes at this time, had he avoided any of these mistakes than he just might have been in a better situation, but unfortunately for the bandanna-clad teenager, he made the mistakes. Ryoga missed the obvious clues visible on the other individual's features and tone, he blatantly ignored the way his danger sense was now screaming at him, and he overlooked the sheer anger and irritation the Ranma was radiating in an almost visible aura.<p>"That's funny Ranma, I wasn't in the mood to have my life ruined by you and what you've done to me, so now we're almost even." Ryoga dropped into a fighting stance ready to deal punishment to his tormentor.<p>"Now stand up and get ready to take your beating like a man."<p>The fanged boy attacked Ranma with a punch that could crush rock.<p>And the ceiling of Ranma's room got a new skylight as Ryoga's body went flying into the air.<p>"I told you I wasn't in the mood," stated an irritated pigtailed martial artist as he stood impassively watching Ryoga disappear over the horizon.<p>A cold wet droplet hit Ranma's nose, causing him to look up through his new skylight just in time to catch the rainstorm, which entered the Nerima area a few moments ago.<p>"Well that's just fantastic now isn't it!"<p>The now female Ranma sighed in defeat and prepared to try and get some sleep, resigned to ignore the falling rain, after all, camping out with his father for ten years of his life had led him to get used to such things.<p>A whimper from the man made panda redirected Ranma's attention to the useless lump of fur, an evil grin spread across his face as he glanced from the hole to the very plump panda.<p>` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Osaka, Japan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<p>Shampoo finished the packing of her campsite. It looked like the pursuit of Ranma would be continuing now rather than later.<p>She had come to this conclusion after the rather important messenger had advised her to continue along her path as soon as possible.<p>Shampoo sighed as she put the last of her equipment into her backpack. She enjoyed camping out like this without any worries, well almost any worries.  Unfortunately she wouldn't be able to camp out when she reached the village called Tokyo. From what the young Amazon warrior had heard Nerima was a sub-village within a very large village.<p>If she were to survive and live within the village she would have to find herself somewhere to stay. Thankfully Amazon herb and medicine knowledge were second to none. She wouldn't have too much trouble getting herself to be hired by some stupid male healer. Her beauty and body were more than enough to influence any simple minded male into hiring her in the hopes of getting her into bed.<p>Shampoo's thoughts were interrupted by a falling body a few meters away from her. She spun around to face the intruder only to be confronted by the same perverted spirit that was spying on her earlier. Pulling out her bonbori she swore that she would make it pay. Castration might be in order as a matter of fact.<p>Ryoga shook the cobwebs from his head and looked around. Ranma sure had a good kicking leg, maybe he wasn't quite as weak as the fanged martial artist had expected. His heart skipped a beat as he saw the same purple haired girl he'd seen bathing naked in a stream before.<p>At the memory Ryoga's nose almost shot out a gusher of blood. It was obvious that this girl was none too happy to see him. Rather than try and explain it really wasn't his fault, and before the martial artist could explain the girl charged him wielding a very funny looking pair of clubs.<p>Ryoga did the only honorable thing and ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. He ran straight for Shampoo's traps, unaware of their existence with the purple haired fury behind him.<p>` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<p>"Well that is one bullet dodged." The armoured figure collapsed into its chair allowing the tension to bleed off as it idly stroked a midnight black dagger back and forth on the stonework of the chair.<p>"Not quite the skilful touch we could have hoped for," replied the shadowy figure, which was lurking by the viewing screen watching the scenes unfold around Ranma, the focus of many gods. "He still has the seppuku contract that the two humans calling themselves his mother and father created hanging over his neck."<p>"His mother is not a fool, she will see that he is a man amongst men easily enough, anyone who watches the godslayer for a while can see just how masculine he is."<p>The cloaked figured shot a questioning look at its ally, well as questioning a look as is possible when you can't see any more of a face than shadows. "Oh really and since when has the chaos surrounding this individual ever allowed anything simple that is obviously meant to go one way to go that way without some weird or strange coincidence sending it awry."<p>"No one likes a pessimist."<p>"You are a pessimist."<p>"And just how many entities do you know that actually like me," the armoured figure replied with a smirk. " I do think it's well past time I introduced myself to the godslayer."<p>"Are you sure that's wise," inquired the cloaked figure.<p>"We'll see now won't we?"<p>The armoured figure laughed while the cloaked figure hung its head.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 16, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>This chapter flowed pretty well; I've always seen Nodoka as the type of person who may jump to conclusions, as anybody might under certain circumstances, but as level headed as she is and not the most normal person I might add (who else carries around a katana in the hopes of meeting your son and husband to cut their heads off), anything could happen.<p>As for Shampoo bathing in the stream a few chapters back, this story is starting over from the beginning, so the only cursed members are Genma, Ranma, Ryoga, and anyone who was cursed before hand. Mousse and Shampoo are both un-cursed and didn't get cursed until later in the series.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send an e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
