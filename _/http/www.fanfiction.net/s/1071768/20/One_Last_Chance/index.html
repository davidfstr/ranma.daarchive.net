</div><p>One Last Chance Ch.20</p><p>A  Day in Nerima</p><p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and  all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take  credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for the  entertainment purposes of both myself and the readers of this story,  and I am making no money off it in any way shape or form.</p><p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I  am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome  constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice. I have a lot on my  plate right now and work on this whenever possible which,  unfortunately is not as much as I would like too. I apologize for the  long wait between chapters.</p><p>"Speech"</p><p>'Thoughts'</p><p>Sound effects&gt;</p><p>-Scene  change/flashback-</p><p>Signs</p><p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to  Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks  to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and  feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. A martial arts  challenge has been put forth from Ranma and Akane to Mikado and  Azusa, which will determine the ownership of Akane's ring. The  twist to this is that Ranma and Akane challenged the golden pair to a  proper martial arts match and not a martial arts skating match.  Knocked unconscious, the pair was then rushed to the dojo where Genma  and Soun tried to get them married. Due to the timely intervention  they were able to avoid the marriage attempt. The next day as Ranma  escorted Hiroshi and Daisuke home he ran into Ryoga. Ryoga got into a  fight with Ranma, which resulted in Ryoga sustained a serious injury  as a result of Ranma's carelessness. Ranma rushed his rival to Dr.  Tofu's clinic as quickly as he possibly could where Ryoga received  treatment for his wound. Ryoga also inadvertently learned that Ranma  was cursed to turn into a female and that the pigtailed martial  artist also happened to be the one who pushed him into the spring of  drowned pig. Ranma left the clinic shortly after, leaving Ryoga to  recover. On his way back to the Tendo Dojo Ranma in his female form  encountered Shampoo. Rather than attacking him, she glomped onto him,  gave him the kiss of marriage, and then told him she loved him.  Cologne then showed up and told Ranma that the matriarch knew that  Ranma was a he and that Ranma was now married to Shampoo.</p><p>"All around me are familiar faces,  familiar places.</p><p>Getting ready for the daily races.  Going nowhere, going nowhere."</p><p>Song Mad World</p><p>By Gary Jules<p>-Streets of  Nerima, Evening-<p>"How did you know," Ranma asked  Cologne, trying to play dumb while ignoring the bouncy, well endowed  Amazon who was rubbing up against him.</p><p>"How did we know what son-in-law,"  Cologne asked, also playing dumb, although she knew exactly what he  meant.</p><p>"How did you know that I was a  guy?" Ranma clarified to the Amazon matriarch while trying to  maneuver out of Shampoo's grip without touching any of the more  intimate areas.</p><p>"Well son-in-law, it is quite  obvious, all one has to do is merely look at you to see that you are  a male and quite a handsome one at that." Cologne fanes a swoon,  "if only I was a couple of hundred years younger myself, I would  give my great grand daughter a run for her money."</p><p>Ranma could not help but shiver as a  cold chill goes down his spine at even the thought of being with  Cologne.</p><p>Ranma tried to ignore the voluptuous  Amazon rubbing herself bodily against him. This was made easier by  the fact he was trying to stare down the girl's great great  grandmother.</p><p>"I won't join your tribe."  Ranma firmly stated, allowing his battle aura to come forth.</p><p>Shampoo jerked away from Ranma as if  burnt and stared in shock at the glowing energy around the pigtailed  boy. She had only ever seen the elders, or other females when a man  did something perverted, put forth a battle aura.</p><p>'If she makes me fight I will  destroy her.' Ranma told himself. 'I can't allow her to be an  enemy, if it comes too a battle, I'll have to finish her off. She  and her Great Granddaughter plagued me with their spells and potions  for far too long, I refuse too allow her to wreck Akane and my  happiness again.'</p><p>'But she taught us so much, almost  as much as my father.' Ranma replied, 'Akane and I both know  things are going to be much harder this time around, Loki told us  so.'</p><p>'Yes he told us, and do you know  what I already know what she taught me, if I kill her now it will  take care of the problems she will create for Akane and I.' An evil  glint came to Ranma's eyes as he considered the benefits of just  getting rid of his enemies right off.</p><p>'If they're gone I'll lose the  only friends I've had.' Ranma thought sadly, thinking of all the  good times that he had with them.</p><p>'But I don't need them,'  countered Ranma, 'I have Akane and she is all I need, as long as I  have her no one else matters. I will destroy anybody I have too if  that is what it takes.' Ranma turned his gaze towards Shampoo, 'Of  course I'd need to get rid of her as well he thought, otherwise I'd  have her entire tribe after me.'</p><p>'What am I thinking, killing is  wrong, sure Cologne has done some bad stuff, but she has also been  there for me during some bad times to help me.'</p><p>The internal debate raged on in the  troubled martial artist as the two foreigners watched, waiting for  the outcome.</p><p>Cologne stared intently at Ranma, she  had become quite familiar with his aura over the two years she had  known him in her previous life, and was able to tell instantly that  there was something off with his aura this time around. Unfortunately  she couldn't quite put her finger on it without carefully studying  him. Something he was sure to refuse in his currently agitated state.</p><p>Missed from her observation the ring  on Ranma's finger twinkled with an inner flame.<p>-Woods Somewhere  in Europe-<p>"Where am I now?" Ryoga asked  rather quietly.</p><p>Not that he'd ever admit it, but  Ryoga was a little unnerved by the silence of the forest. Most woods  he had camped in were usually bustling with activity; even at night  there were sounds that let one know there were birds and animals  nearby.</p><p>Except for the occasional wolf  howling there was an eerie silence penetrating the very air of the  woods.</p><p>"I'd rather be chased by that  crazy girl than spend any more time in this wood." Ryoga quietly  said. Remembering the nude woman in the woods who chased him while  yelling in some strange language.</p><p>In the trees a pair of eyes followed  Ryoga's movements through the woods.</p><p>Deciding to stop and get his bearing  the fanged martial artist sat down beneath a tree and pulled out a  map studying the path he'd have to take.</p><p>"Bende Nocte" A voice broke the  silence of the woods, startling Ryoga who immediately jumped up into  a fighting stance, letting the map of the Rio Grande fall to the  earth forgotten.</p><p>"Where are you," Ryoga asked,  looking around the area, but failing to see anybody.</p><p>"I don't speak whatever language  your talking, would you happen to know English?" The voice asked.</p><p>"Yeah I know a little English,"  Ryoga replied guardedly.</p><p>"Excellent, well I said 'Good  Evening'." The voice replied amusement hidden in the tone.</p><p>"Who are you," Ryoga asked, "and  where are you?" Ryoga began turning around, trying to watch all  sides at once.</p><p>"I am the count Vladimir Von  Carstein and you have wandered into my domain." The voice replies.</p><p>"I'm just passing through."  Ryoga replied flushing slightly.</p><p>"Oh and where are you passing  through too?"</p><p>"I'm trying to get to Nerima."</p><p>"I have never heard of this Nerima,  where might it be that you must pass through my territory."</p><p>"It's in Tokyo." Ryoga replied,  embarrassed that he'd wandered into someone's backyard, although  he hadn't seen a fence yet.</p><p>"Tokyo, as in the capitol of  Japan?" The voice deadpanned.</p><p>"Yes." Ryoga replied in a rather  quite voice, 'damn I must have wandered off track again.'</p><p>"You are a little off track young  one."</p><p>"Really, where am I, Hokkaido,  Okinawa, this does look a little like Honshu." Ryoga suggested  hopefully, but fearing he was a little further off.</p><p>"Try Romania." The voice replied.</p><p>"Where's that?" Ryoga asked,  cursing as he looked around for the map he dropped and wondering if  he had another one.</p><p>"It is in Europe, but more  importantly it is the last place you will ever visit." Replied the  tall man stepping out of the very darkness itself.</p><p>The man was tall standing 5'10"  he was very pale, but something seemed to burn within his eyes. He  was dressed in an archaic nobleman's style, with expensive red and  black velvets and silks. He didn't look very physically strong, but  he seemed to put out an aura, which suggested a feral rage kept  barely in control.</p><p>Ryoga picked up on none of this,  merely hearing the obvious threat.</p><p>Well acquainted with threats himself,  Ryoga shrugged off his traveling pack and cracked his knuckles, a  fight welcome after walking around for so long.</p><p>Vladimir razes an eyebrow seeing  prey, which didn't cower and beg for its life like most of the  miserable peasants usually did. The nobleman smiled revealing a  glistening set of pearly whites, with a pair of elongated incisors.</p><p>Ryoga smiled right back revealing his  own set of elongated canines. At the sight of his opponents teeth the  count faltered thinking he had made a mistake in choosing his prey.  Seeing his opponent off balance Ryoga took advantage of the opening,  charging forwards and delivering a punishing blow to the European's  midsection.</p><p>The count was sent flying backwards,  his back slamming into a tree. "Are you a child of the night?"  The count asked having seen this individual move much faster and  stronger than any other human he had ever seen.</p><p>"What are you talking about,"  Ryoga asked, moving in closer to keep pressure on this strange person  who wanted to fight and now wanted to talk. He launched a quick kick  at the individual's exposed flank.</p><p>Vladimir saw the incoming kick and  deftly plucked the boy's foot out of the air, slamming him face  first into the tree, which the count had just impacted.</p><p>"Impudent whelp." The Count  growled, swinging the lost boy around and sending him flying back to  where his pack was.</p><p>Ryoga stumbled back to his feet  groaning, how did someone so small produce so much strength. Ryoga  looked over as the European stalked towards him. The fangs were  unusual, but they were only slightly longer than the ones he had. The  fanged boy realized that this person wasn't using any actual  martial arts; he was using speed and strength.</p><p>Smirking to himself Ryoga launched  himself forwards feinting a blow to the Count's head and preparing  to follow up with a powerful kick.</p><p>Vladimir prepared to block the punch  that was coming, surprised when his prey pulled back at the last  moment. A smile crept onto the European's face as he saw the kick  coming. This mortal was quite a skilled fighter, were he one of the  blooded he would be truly powerful.</p><p>Ryoga looked down at his leg, grasped  firmly within the pale hand, he tried to pull back, but he was off  balance and couldn't escape the iron grasp of the Count.</p><p>Spinning the upstart around in his  grasp the count released Ryoga, knocking him right back into a tree.</p><p>"You are a few hundred years to  young to deal with me." Vladimir told the boy, stalking over too  him. This was such an enervating evening; this child had given him  more amusement than any of his previous hunts a hundred years back.</p><p>Ryoga groaned, he must have hit his  head when the European threw him. Lying on the ground, he tried to  stand, but his head was still spinning and he just slid back down the  tree.</p><p>The Count was almost disappointed  when his prey slid back down to the ground. Obviously he had thrown  the boy with a bit too much force, but all good things must come to  an end, and the hunger was upon him.</p><p>The fanged boy watched his opponent  stalk towards him, a hungry look in the European's eye. He tried to  get up or at least to turn away, but something held him in place.</p><p>Vladimir allowed himself a smile as  the boy's will struggled against his own, the child was powerful  indeed, but he was weak from bashing his head most likely. Opening  his mouth the count allowed his incisors to grow to their maximum  length.</p><p>"Do not worry child, when you  awaken the world will be your plaything." Vladimir stated, this  Asian boy was worthy of the eternal night, which he and the other  nobles shared. This young man would be an excellent heir, Yuri would  be jealous.</p><p>Ryoga felt his consciousness slipping  from him as he felt the Count's hands baring his neck.<p>-Rooftops of  Nerima-<p>Cologne watched the young man before  her, knowing that he might fight her; she could see that it would  only take a slight push for him to attack her, at his current level  of development he wouldn't be a true danger for another year and a  half at least. It wouldn't be long though; last time he was almost  her equal when he defeated Herb and his two servants. She hadn't  realized how far the boy had risen until he beat Saffron.</p><p>"Would you seek to fight me then,"  Cologne asked, gripping her staff as she faced off with the irritated  pigtailed boy in front of her.</p><p>Inside Cologne's mind, she knew  this was a very pivotal moment; should Ranma choose to fight she  would have to fight him.</p><p>'And that's where my choice must  come.' Cologne didn't want Ranma as an enemy too the tribe, it  was not something she could afford.</p><p>'He would become too powerful too  quickly, and should he some day come back and wish to harm us, I fear  for the future of the Amazons. If I can't be assured that there is  some chance to make him trust us at least partially, then tonight he  will die.' Cologne thought too herself, her face hardening as she  prepared herself for a task she had no wish to carry out. Unbeknownst  to her the Ranma she faced was much more than she thought.</p><p>"Not unless you force me too."  Ranma replied, causing the Matriarch to release a breath she hadn't  even known she was holding.</p><p>"I have no wish too fight you old  ghoul," The pigtailed boy continued his aura fading, while earning  a sharp look from Cologne, too which he was oblivious.</p><p>The tense moment having passed, both  relaxed, both understanding that something had passed between them,  but neither knowing what it was.<p>-Kuno estate, Nerima Ward, Tokyo,  Japan, Asia, Earth, Solar System, Milky Way-<p>"Ho Ho Ho, brother dearest, why are  you so perturbed tonight," Kodachi asked her brother.</p><p>Kuno narrowed his eyes, if his  twisted sister was asking after his health, he knew it was from  anything, but familial concern.</p><p>"Why nothing at all sister mine,  whatever could have driven you too ask such an inane question of my  noble self?"</p><p>"OH brother dear, you know I have a  great interest in your health, whatever would I do if something  happened to you?" Kodachi asked, 'besides throw a party.' She  silently added.</p><p>'Besides celebrate,' Kuno  silently replied, but allowed he said. "Weep I am sure, but do not  trouble thyself, tis nothing the master of house Kuno can't deal  with." Kuno was growing impatient with his sister's meaningless  prattle, usually she didn't bother him unless there was something  she wanted.</p><p>"Ahh, but you are not master of  this house, not as long as our beloved father still lives." Kodachi  shot back, unable to resist aggravating further her sibling.</p><p>"He has not been master of this  house since the cur abandoned us," Kuno shouted back standing,  violently shoving the desk he sat behind away, scattering the papers  all over the floor.</p><p>Kodachi reeled back momentarily from  her brother, he often yelled, but rarely did he put so much emotion  into his words, usually he merely spouted poetic nonsense.</p><p>"He has not been master of this  house." Kuno repeated adding, "Not since that night." Kuno's  voice grew heavy with emotion, losing volume, "not since that  night."</p><p>Kodachi felt tears forming in her  eyes, she knew what he was talking about, but her pride wouldn't  let her back down. "I don't remember you doing anything that  night brother mine, what did you do to help our family?"</p><p>Kuno recoiled as if struck. "How  dare you!" Kuno yelled back, moving closer to his twisted sister,  fire shining in his eyes. "How dare you say that, there was nothing  I could have done. There was nothing either of us could do,  nothing…nothing." Kuno's voice trailed off.</p><p>"Excuse me," Kodachi quietly  responded, fleeing her brother's room, she ran back to her room as  fast as she could, blitzing past the odd servant whom would silently  avert their eyes.</p><p>Kuno stood, silently watching where  his sister had been standing. He stepped forwards, shutting his door  and dropping a thick bar into place, sealing out the world. Flipping  a switch several iron plates dropped down sealing off the windows.  Alone and secure Kuno walked over to his bed. Flipping another switch  all the pictures of Akane, which surrounded his walls, were covered.</p><p>Still without having spoken the  Eldest Kuno sibling opened his bedside table, dodging the knife that  was shot out at him from the spring trap. He reached in and pulled  out a small rectangular picture frame.</p><p>Reverently stroking the picture  frame, Kuno stared at the image, slightly faded with time. The  picture showed a loving family of four people all together.</p><p>The picture showed a father standing  just off center, his hand resting on the shoulder of a beautiful  woman in a kimono. On the woman's lap was a young girl with  beautiful long black hair bounced happily dressed in a white leotard,  a shining smile on the daughter's face. The man's other hand  rested in front of him upon the shoulder of a young boy in a hakama,  the boy clutched a small boken in his little hands while trying to  look mature.</p><p>"Mother," Kuno breathed out  almost inaudibly, a lone tear sliding down his face.<p>-Elsewhere in the  Kuno Mansion-<p>Quickly disabling the traps at her  door Kodachi ran into her bedroom, bolting her door and rearming the  traps before proceeding. She hurled herself onto her bed, weeping  into a pillow.</p><p>"Why mommy, why did you leave us?"</p><p>Why, why did she and her brother have  to fight? Why did she have to take pleasure in tormenting her  brother, as she knew he took pleasure in tormenting her?</p><p>Nothing had ever been the same since  that night. She couldn't remember everything, but she knew it took  her mother away from the family, and nothing had ever been the same  since.</p><p>They had all tried to escape it, each  in their own way. Her father, once considered to be an eccentric, but  well respected member of the community had turned into an individual  who terrorized his school's populace, both student and teacher.  Eventually he retreated to Hawaii for a sabbatical, escaping even the  small responsibility</p><p>Her brother, while not the best  student, he was a good kendoist. After that night, Tatewaki had  thrown himself into Kendo with an almost fanatical devotion. He rose  from being a talented student of the art too mastering it and  surpassing all his teachers. He had suffered too, retreating into his  own little fantasy world of feudal times, seeing the world with jaded  eyes.</p><p>She, well she had done that same  thing. Rhythmic Gymnastics and botany had been two small hobbies her  mother had introduced her too. Afterwards her hobbies had dominated  her life. Warping to fit her needs, she had sworn to be the best and  never lose a match in her chosen field, just like her big brother.</p><p>When she was twelve, during a  rhythmic gymnastics match, her opponent's team member had splashed  water on her side of the ring, causing her to slip. From that moment  on the black rose had been born. It had started out small, weighting  a baton, removing a support here and there, but it had continued to  escalate.</p><p>Now her opponents never even showed  up too matches, those who would not be cowed would be rendered  incapable of even competing. In her mind though she always justified  it as doing it for her family. Her reasoning had built a prison  around her.</p><p>"Is this really worth it?"  Kodachi asked herself, reaching out to stroke a picture of her mother  that sat beside her bed.</p><p>"Yes child it is," a sensuous  voice spoke to her. Instantly snapping out a baton and pulling her  spare ribbon she twirled, pushing herself off of her bed and landing  in the center of her room.</p><p>"Who dares invade my domicile?"  Asked Kodachi, furious at the intrusion. She would make them pay for  this offence.</p><p>Stepping out of the shadows an  individual came forwards, "I do my beautiful child." The  individual replied in a husky yet silky voice. "I have come to  assist you in getting what you want."</p><p>Kodachi looked closely at the  intruder. It was hard to tell whether this individual was a man or a  woman, unable to tell from even the voice. The stranger had long  flowing black hair down the back, an effeminate, but strangely  masculine face. From the loose fitting black robes the person wore,  she couldn't even tell if there was an Adam's apple or what the  person's body looked like.</p><p>"Why should I listen too you, how  could you even know what it is I desire, I have all I need."  Kodachi shot back, extremely unnerved by this strange intruder who  had somehow gotten into her room.</p><p>"I know your desires my dear,"  the stranger glided forwards, reaching out and stroking her face.</p><p>Kodachi was unable to stop this  person as they stepped forwards and stroked her cheek. "Who are  you?" she was able to get out. Desire flooded through her, and a  need she hadn't even realized before.</p><p>"I am Khalmeel," the stranger  drew the young girl into an embrace, cradling her as one would their  own child. "I know you desire love, I know you desire  companionship, I know you desire one who can protect you. I can offer  you that."</p><p>"You?" Kodachi quietly asked,  staring at Khalmeel, 'Can he really protect me, can this man be  everything I desire?' Silently asked Kodachi too herself, hope and  fear was plainly displayed across her face.</p><p>"No child not I," The stranger  stated, Kodachi's face fell, "but I know the man for you. He is a  noble and skilled individual, he is handsome, strong, kind, and he  can be yours."</p><p>Kodachi was uncertain, but Khalmeel  started massaging her back, whispering quietly into her ear, "He is  yours for the taking and he will love you, and you will love him."  Promised the angel sent by the gods themselves to assist her.</p><p>'He must be an angel, he was made  so perfect, coming to me in my hour of need.' Kodachi decided.</p><p>"What must I do?" asked Kodachi,  resting her head on the angel's shoulder. Unseen by her Khalmeel  smiled evilly, displaying a row of razor sharp teeth.</p><p>"You must merely win him from one  who doesn't truly deserve him, one who abuses him, one who he can't  escape from alone. He is bound to her by their family in a  relationship he doesn't wish." Khalmeel responded in his silky  voice.</p><p>"Who is this wondrous man?" asked  a breathless Kodachi.</p><p>"His name is Ranma Saotome."  Replied Khalmeel, laying Kodachi back onto her bed, having picked her  up and moved her like she was nothing more than a child.</p><p>"Ranma Saotome." Kodachi  murmured, lying back in her head with unfocused eyes, looking towards  the ceiling.</p><p>"Soon child soon." The angel  said, heading towards the shadows and the waiting portal, which would  take it back too the safety of the warp.</p><p>"Ranma," Khalmeel heard Kodachi  murmur one final time before stepping through the portal, leaving  behind the girl and her room.</p><p>The warp portal closed behind the  departing form, unseen by Kodachi as she watched the ceiling.</p><p>"Ranma-sama." Kodachi breathed  out before falling into blissful slumber.</p><p>A picture of a woman lay discarded on  the floor beside the bed, forgotten about.<p>-Eye of Terror,  The warp-<p>Back within the arguable safety of  the warp Khalmeel's head elongated, a second pair of arms sprouting  from below the first. The creature's body started growing until it  was twelve feet tall. The robes disappearing as the body expanded,  the skin growing extremely pale. Horns extended from the back of the  head, while two of the hands expanded into large lobster like claws.  It was impossible to determine the creature's gender, yet it  appeared to be both. Despite its hideous appearance it exuded  sexuality.</p><p>Looking into the raging warp the  creature by the name of Khalmeel spoke.</p><p>"She is yours master Slaanesh."</p><p>And within the raging storm of  chaotic energy, which makes up the warp, a dark god smiled.</p><p>-  Rooftops of Nerima -</p><p>Unaware of the internal debate going  on within her husband, Shampoo watched on with interest. When he  stared at her with a strange look in her eyes, a chill went through  her spine, and she backed up a step, but then the look passed and a  softer, almost fond expression</p><p>Shampoo was unable to understand the  words of the conversation, but she could read the expressions and  body language of both parties. As she watched, she saw her husband  get into a fighting stance, as did her great grandmother. They  exchanged a few words in that barbaric language of her husband.</p><p>'I'll just make sure he learns  Mandarin when we return to the village, Rin Shi will be jealous when  she sees what a handsome and obviously skilled man she had retrieved.  Cute butt too.' Shampoo thought to herself, and seeing her  husband's aura fade and an almost content look come to his face.</p><p>'He's cute, strong, and skilled.  He's perfect.' Shampoo thought too herself. Throwing herself at  him again she glomped onto his body, rubbing her own against his. She  marveled in the sculpted body beneath her, it was marvelous, almost  as if someone had carved him from stone.</p><p>She knew that with her own body she  would have him in no time, 'After all, males all think with their  crotches, especially those her own age.' Shampoo knew this for a  fact, having teased and led on many of the boys in the village, at  least until that blind fool Mousse had taken a single comment too  seriously and started chasing off any male who even looked at her.</p><p>She could feel her husband was very  tense beneath her grasp; strangely enough he wasn't trying to hold  her or do anything a male should try like grope her.</p><p>Well she'd just have to help this  innocent male along with a little physical encouragement.<p>-Tokyo, Nerima  Ward, park-<p>Within a poorly lit circle of trees  in the park stood a cloaked figure; his body is shrouded in dark  black robes. Within the center of the clearing burned a brazier.  Charms and wards surrounded the clearing.</p><p>Before one tree stood the figure,  candles burning on his headband.</p><p>"Oh Akane," The thin figured  moaned as it sat within a dense circle of trees, "why can't you  see I love you and I'm the best for you." He moaned as he drove a  spike into the doll, which resembled someone with a long black  ponytail and red shirt.</p><p>"Ranma can't possibly treat you  right like I can." The figure wailed, hammering in another nail.</p><p>"Why don't you leave that poor  tree alone Mister Hikaru Gosunkugi." Gosunkugi spun around, fearful  that he was going to get fined for the open fire. "There are better  ways to get that which you wish than torturing innocent trees."</p><p>The man was tall and skinny, looking  much like Gosunkugi himself. The difference was the staff the man  carried, the slitted yellow eyes, and the aura of power around the  man that made the hairs on the back of Gosunkugi's neck stand on  end.</p><p>"Who are you?" Gosunkugi  fearfully asked, backing into the tree.</p><p>"I am Melcior," the stranger  replied, bowing as one would too an equal. "And I am here to assist  you in acquiring what you desire."</p><p>Gosunkugi's eyes widened, "You  could help me get Akane too love me?" Gosunkugi asked hopefully.</p><p>"I can help you defeat Kuno and  Ranma," Melcior smiled, knowing he had this pathetic excuse for a  sorcerer hook, line, "and what's even better young one, I can get  her too desire and serve you."</p><p>And sinker.</p><p>'What should I do,' Gosunkugi  wondered, torn between the obvious power, but well aware of the  dangers that this would involve.</p><p>Although Gosunkugi's spiritual  strength was too low for him to actually use magic, that didn't  mean that he was lacking in knowledge of the occult or metaphysical  matters. He had read many books, most warned of accepting power from  other worldly strangers.</p><p>"Why should I trust you," asked  the thin boy in a hesitant tone, he really didn't want to anger  this powerful being before him.</p><p>"If you would quit cowering,"  Melcior replied, narrowing his eyes, face drawing tight in obvious  displeasure. The air around the man seemed to throb with barely  controlled energy. "You do not need to trust me right now, I have  been sent to assist you because our goals are the same and we see you  as a valuable ally. If you will work with me trust will come in time.  My masters are very generous and you show much promise."</p><p>"What is it you offer me?"  Gosunkugi asked, stepping forwards and looking closer at the strange  man.</p><p>"Power to allow you to defeat Ranma  and Kuno," The strange man lifted his hand pointing it at the tree  Gosunkugi had been hammering into. A moment later a sickly green ray  rushed from his hand slamming into the tree. "Power to give you  that which you desire."</p><p>Gosunkugi stared in fear at the tree  as it shriveled up, the trunk rotting as the limbs twisted. Gosunkugi  could have sworn he heard the tree crying in pain as red sap began to  escape from the trunk itself.</p><p>"I can make you the most powerful  person in Tokyo." Melkior declared, throwing his arms wide. The  young boy could smell the ozone in the air as small lightning bolts  crawled over the sorcerer's arms and body.</p><p>"Can I think about it for a while?"  Asked the pale young man.</p><p>Melkior frowned, but nodded. "Very  well, take what time you need, but do not take too long for offers  such as this never come more than once to any one person."</p><p>Gosunkugi nodded as the stranger  turned around and walked towards the tree line, a red and orange  portal opened up as Melkior approached.</p><p>"When you decide, return to this  spot and call for me. I shall give you a week before my generous  offer expires." With that said, Melkior stepped through the glowing  portal.</p><p>The shimmering rift stayed open for a  few seconds before closing, leaving nothing more than the smell of  ozone in the air.</p><p>Gosunkugi took this opportunity to  finally realize that he had just faced down an individual more  powerful than Kuno, practically said no and was still alive. As a way  of congratulating himself for his bravery in the face of such  destructive power, the young man fainted.<p>-Rooftops of  Nerima-<p>Ranma sighed, tensing up as he felt  Shampoo's arms closing around him. He had really hoped to avoid her  this time around, or at least to escape her affections.</p><p>The pigtailed martial artist remained  still as Shampoo's hand began to roam over his chest. The busty  Amazon only took his non-response as incentive to continue.</p><p>Cologne could see Ranma was getting  more and more irritated by her great granddaughter's physical  invasion of his space. She internally sighed to herself while keeping  a neutral expression.</p><p>She wished that she had made it  clearer to Shampoo that Ranma wasn't like most other males. He  didn't fall into the usual stereotypical category for men that most  Amazons believed. If he had then one of the dozens of things, which  they had tried, would have succeeded in ensnaring son-in-law.</p><p>"Shampoo, release him and cease  these antics, they bring shame on our bloodline and to all Amazons  seeing you throw yourself at this man." The matriarch criticized  the young Amazon in Mandarin.</p><p>"Aiyah, Sorry Great-Grandmother, it  was not my intention, but isn't this how a man is taken, by  overwhelming his head with the emotion of lust?" Shampoo asked,  releasing her grasp on the pigtailed boy, and moving to stand a more  acceptable distance beside him.</p><p>"Well look at the time I've got  to be getting home." Ranma stated, glancing at his wrist and the  non-existent watch.</p><p>Cologne's eyes narrowed at the ring  on Ranma's finger. "Of course son-in-law, do not fret we will be  seeing you again, of that I am sure."</p><p>The matriarch began cackling, sending  a shiver up both Shampoo and Ranma's spines.</p><p>Ranma leapt off the roof onto the  ground, touching down lightly before leaping away again. Soon he was  gone, hidden by buildings and the growing night.<p>-Woods  somewhere in Europe-<p>"NOOOO," Ryoga cried, trying to  sit up and fight the hands. He wasn't sure what this stranger was,  but he had heard plenty from campfire tales through his troubles that  he was pretty sure who this was.</p><p>"Do not struggle child, you will  enjoy this." The man replied, unknowingly proving Ryoga's  assumptions true. Ryoga felt the European's cool breath upon his  neck.</p><p>"Don't touch me you pervert,"  the fanged boy cried, anger giving him strength to punch the count in  the face. 'I knew he was a gay pedophile, who else would dress like  that.' Ryoga thought, filling himself with righteous anger.</p><p>"Impudent wretch," Vladimir  shouted, backhanding his prey.</p><p>Ryoga could feel his brain rolling  around his skull. He could barely cling to consciousness, but refused  to give in to this hideous beast, who knows what would happen to him  if he passed out.</p><p>"Leave him alone," a deep  growling voice echoed around them, causing Ryoga to look past the  European pervert, and Vladimir to spin around.</p><p>'Who could have approached without  me hearing it?' The count thought, he was in no mood to fight with  a rival at this time.</p><p>Before the count stood an individual  most would choose not to run into on a crowded street in the middle  of the day let alone in a dark alley.</p><p>He easily stood six foot nine, with  arms thicker than a large man's leg. His muscles ran along his body  like steel ropes. From the waist up he was bare, revealing a  much-scarred chest; below his waist he wore pants seemingly made from  furs and hides of different animals. His face was unremarkable,  neither handsome nor ugly, the man's black hair matted down with  sweat against his skull.</p><p>The count marveled a second, he could  tell that this man was not one of the kindred, his heart beat too  loudly for even one drunk on blood. A magnificent spectacle, this one  burnt with energy as bright as the young man lying on the ground.</p><p>"Leave this place bloodsucker,"  the big man's voice boomed out.</p><p>"Run," Ryoga said as loudly as he  could, "he's stronger than he looks."</p><p>Vladimir laughed out loud hearing the  young boy's words. "Yes run while you can and perhaps he will  fill me enough that I won't come for you too." The count laughed,  when he was done with the boy he would track this one down too. He  would feed well tonight indeed.</p><p>"I am here for the boy, move or  die." Stated the large man, almost as an after thought he added, "I  would prefer you died personally, but it is up too you."</p><p>The count began too laugh, "This is  the single best life of my unlife, I can't believe you know what I  am, yet you still continue to threaten me. Priceless."</p><p>"Last chance," the man stated  emotionlessly, flexing his muscles, making them ripple across his  half naked body.</p><p>"What is your name stranger, you  have amused me and I will see you properly buried." The vampire  bowed graciously.</p><p>"I am Kellrak," stated the man,  "and now you will die."</p><p>"I am Vladimir Vo…" the count  was cut off as the large man charged him.</p><p>For such a large man he was even  faster than the boy. Vladimir barely had time to dodge as a fist  larger than the count's head passed by.</p><p>Stepping past Kellrak's fist, the  count backhanded the large man with a goodly amount of his strength.</p><p>When the large man's head merely  jerked backwards, rather than being torn off the count was so  surprised, he didn't see the big man's fist coming for him.</p><p>Flying back into a tree one thought  passed through the vampire's head, 'he's much stronger than I  thought.' Slamming into the tree he groaned in pain, at least 3 of  his ribs were broken and would take more than a day to heal.</p><p>Kellrak didn't give the bloodsucker  a chance to recover, moving forwards towards the downed creature,  cocking his fist back to deal another punch.</p><p>Vladimir charged forwards, using all  his considerable strength, he tackled the giant with enough force to  knock over a tree.</p><p>Moving backwards slightly Kellrak  smiled down at the smaller man's back, his red eyes burning  brightly.</p><p>"Fight little bloodsucker, fight  for your life."</p><p>Reaching down to grab the vampire's  waist, he lifted up the smaller man with ease before slamming the  count into the ground.</p><p>Unable to fee himself from Kellrak's  grip the count responded by raking his hands across the man's  chest. Nails as hard as steel bit into flesh, taking out small strips  as Vladimir frantically clawed at the larger man.</p><p>The large man ignored the count's  frenzied clawing, lifting up the vampire, Kellrak slammed the  creature into the ground again, creating a small crater around him.  Grabbing the dazed vampire by his legs the large man began slamming  Vladimir's face into a tree.</p><p>Vladimir felt his nose shatter  against the tree trunk, through the ringing in his head he could hear  the large man laughing like a maniac.</p><p>Throwing the vampire across the  clearing Kellrak turned and stalked towards the little man.</p><p>"Fight me little bloodsucker, lay  down and I will destroy you." The juggernaut of a man yelled.  "Blood for the Blood god."</p><p>Looking at his opponent, the vampire  felt real fear for the first time in a lifetime.</p><p>"You're not human." The vampire  accused his opponent.</p><p>"Did I ever say I was?" Shot back  Kellrak, reaching down and picking up the nobleman.</p><p>Gripping the nobleman's head with  one hand and the count's body with the other he began pulling. The  count began to scream as he felt the strain in his neck increasing,  and grabbed Kellrak's arms with his hands, struggling in vain  against the growing tension. The muscles in Kellrak's back flexed  as he pulled the count's head off. A sickening pop sounded as the  vampire's head popped off.</p><p>"Blood for the blood god, Skulls  for Khorne." Kellrak stated, turning around and walking towards the  boy.</p><p>"I am here to help you." The big  man stated voice thick with emotion and a smile across his bloody  face as he reached down and picked up the little Asian.</p><p>"Help me with what?" Ryoga asked.  He felt much better as soon the large man laid those huge hands upon  him. The daze in his head began to fade and he began to think clearly  again.</p><p>Ryoga felt anger welling within him,  what right did this person have to come and interfere in his fight.  How dare he.</p><p>Turning over the fanged boy punched  the man carrying him in the face with as much force as he could.</p><p>Glancing down at the burden on his  shoulder, seeming to have ignored the punch the big man smiled.  "Little boy, my name is Kellrak and you aren't ready not yet, but  you will be."</p><p>"Will be for what?" Ryoga asked,  not realizing the man was now speaking to him in fluent Japanese.</p><p>"Revenge." The big man stated as  he walked off into the wood leaving the clearing and body behind  Ryoga over his shoulder with the young boy's pack in one hand.</p><p>"Ranma this is all your fault."  Yelled Ryoga into the night, eliciting loud laughter to burst out  from Kellrak after his statement.<p>-Tokyo, Nerima  Ward, Park-<p>Gosunkugi woke up and looked around  the clearing, his torches had burnt down to embers, thankfully they  hadn't tipped over and started a fire.</p><p>The sickly looking boy sighed in  relief, had a fire started he would have been facing serious jail  time.</p><p>Japan, and even more so Tokyo, was a  place where a large number of people had crammed into a very small  space. Living very close to one another in building that were at one  time and still in some places were nothing more than paper and wood.  As such fear of fire was a very real thought on peoples minds. Fire  regulations were very strict throughout Tokyo and an unattended fire  that caused damage accidentally was a criminal offence.</p><p>Looking at his pocket watch,  Gosunkugi realized it was beginning to get late. Picking up a shovel  he had nearby he dug a small hole and poured the embers into it. Then  he began putting dirt on the embers, not using water so as not to  send up any telltale smoke that would have clued people in to his  activities.</p><p>Gosunkugi went around the clearing  gathering up his mystical supplies. All in all it was a good day, he  performed some cleansing rituals, he didn't have school, he cursed  Ranma Saotome and Tatewaki Kuno, he met with a daemon sent by a dark  god promising power and most likely damnation, he didn't get caught  by the police during his nap, he…</p><p>Gosunkugi froze, dropping all his  supplies on the ground. 'I met with a demon sent by a dark god  promising power and most likely power.' The thin boy repeated to  himself several times, going even paler if that was possible.</p><p>He thought about what was offered too  him. Kuno was a pompous ass that wouldn't allow any sign of  greatness in anybody but himself. He had tortured Furninkan High and  Nerima elementary for years.</p><p>Gosunkugi was a class below Kuno as  such he didn't know the full story, but he had overheard it from  another person in Kuno's grade. One day Kuno had just come to class  with a boken. He had assaulted another student who had made fun of  him over something. Shocked the teacher took Tatewaki to his father  for discipline. The teacher had come back dressed in a suit of  ceremonial Great Armour and began teaching the class the best way to  serve the Emperor.</p><p>Kuno had only gotten worse from that  point on. Gosunkugi had heard that the young boy's father was as  much of a bully if not worse. Strangely enough, the day that Kuno's  class started at Furinkan, principal Kuno had up and vanished to  Hawaii.</p><p>The celebration had lasted for almost  a week and had spanned every grade. Teachers and students standing  side by side as the girls happily dawned the school's fuku,  removing their kimonos and wooden sandals. The boys were even  thankful for the boring black school uniform after the pieces of  armour they had been wearing before hand. The teachers themselves  threw off their Shinto robes and happily wore suits and ties.</p><p>Furinkan never really had complaints  from the students about the uniform code afterwards. Violations of  the uniform code were unheard of, at least until Ranma came along.</p><p>He had been in the school for a  single day and already rumours and shockwaves had spread throughout  the school. Somehow he had won Akane Tendo, the most desirable girl  in school as a fiancée, he had beaten Kuno, and he disobeyed  the dress code. Although all things considered the last was a  relatively minor point.</p><p>Gosunkugi hadn't actually talked  with or met Ranma yet, nor had he even really seen much of the  martial artist as he had taken off with Akane after only a couple of  days of school. The rumours and speculations ran overtime, from they  ran way forever too they eloped too even wilder and crazier theories.</p><p>Gosunkugi didn't really have  anything against Ranma beyond the fact he was with Akane, the only  girl who had ever given him any kind words. He knew the only way to  defeat Saotome would be to accept the daemon's offer.</p><p>One thing was for sure, accepting the  offer would be a mistake. It's not that he doubted the daemon would  keep its promise, far from it. The daemon would uphold its end of any  bargain that was made too the letter, but not the intent of the  contract.</p><p>Gosunkugi realized that now power  came without its price. This was especially true with magic. The thin  boy was tempted; extremely tempted to accept the offer, but he knew  that as with all things in his life it would turn on him.</p><p>Hiding his supplies in a tree hollow,  the sickly looking boy sighed and walked towards his house.</p><p>-Rooftops of  Nerima-<p>'Where could he be?' Akane though  worriedly, she had been searching for Ranma for what seemed like  hours, yet she hadn't found him yet.</p><p>"Ranma where are you?" She asked  no one in particular, leaping down to the street. She didn't know  why she had come here, but it had just seemed right to her.</p><p>Akane just stood there for a moment,  staring at an empty building. For a moment she just stared at it, not  understanding what had brought her here. Looking at the street  address something clicked in her mind. This was the place where the  cat café would be when Cologne finally arrived.</p><p>Ranma had spent much of his time here  and at Uchan's, two places that didn't exist yet, and depending  on the course of events may never exist. So much rested on their  actions.</p><p>"We could leave tomorrow and never  look back. They'd never find us, Loki-sama would keep us safe, we  could be together with none of them interfering." Akane spoke  aloud, sharing her thoughts with the world.</p><p>"They'd never take you from me,  never," fire entered her voice as Akane's ring burned brighter.</p><p>"I won't let anyone take you from  me." She promised the world.</p><p>"You shouldn't make declarations  that are so hard to fulfill." A cold voice warned the young woman.</p><p>Akane spun around in a fighting  stance, "who is there?" she asked, looking around the empty  street.</p><p>Flattening her back to the wall,  Akane looked up and down the street, but she couldn't see anyone.  Akane took a few steps towards the middle of the street before  leaping up onto the roof of a nearby building.</p><p>Surveying the area, Akane still  couldn't see anybody, but she knew she had heard a voice.</p><p>Looking around one last time and  still not catching sight of whomever it was speaking, the dark haired  girl headed off towards the dojo. She was worried about Ranma, but  knew he was ok and would come back to the dojo eventually.</p><p>Deep inside her Akane knew that  should something ever happen to her pigtailed fiancé she would  instinctively know.</p><p>Leaping back towards the dojo, Akane  put the growing feeling of unease behind her. She trusted her fiancé  and would continue to trust him; she wouldn't make the same mistake  this life.</p><p>As she began running back towards the  dojo, she thought about what Ranma might be doing. She trusted him  not to be doing anything improper, but things always did tend to  spiral out of control and even the laws of probability seemed to be  bent by her once reluctant fiancé.</p><p>Without even knowing it Akane changed  direction, heading away from the Tendo Dojo and towards the spot  where Uchan's would someday be.<p>-Somewhere  else-<p>"Her own insecurities will prove to  be her undoing." Stated the hooded figure, turning to face its  partner.</p><p>"Some things are harder to unlearn  than others, even death can't change that." The armoured figure  smirked, "I know that better than most," The armoured figure  turned its gaze towards its companion, "as should you."</p><p>"Death and rebirth are part of the  cycle, it changes little." The armoured figure leaned back on its  throne. "I would have expected you too be in a better mood. After  all it would appear that Tzeencth's has been denied his chance. Who  have expected that a sickly little boy like Gosunkugi who even tries  his hand at magic would be the only one who refused."</p><p>"True, poor Kodachi, she doesn't  know what she is getting herself into." The cloaked figure  remarked, eliciting a glare from the figure's armoured companion.</p><p>"You're not going soft on me are  you dear ally?" The question was asked in a jovial tone, but  contained a very blatant underlying threat.</p><p>"Of course not," snapped the  cloaked one, gliding fluidly over too the armoured figure's throne.  "We're in this till the end now, there is no turning back now.  I'm actually relieved that only two of the four are in the game."</p><p>"We will continue sticking to the  plan as best we can. As long as we can continue unnoticed for just a  while longer then everything will be alright."</p><p>"Indeed."<p>-End of  Chapter 20,  TBC-<p>AN: Well that's another chapter, coming straight  from my twisted mind, of the story done.</p><p>Well it's been almost a year since I updated,  something I am not pleased about. Despite my best intentions I was  unable to complete this chapter until now. Unfortunately I hit  writer's block for part of the time and just didn't know where to  go with the story. Other times I just had other things I had to do.  My apologies, and while I can't promise it won't happen again, I  will finish this story eventually.</p><p>I have now written 20 chapters and almost 100,000  words. The average novel is 80,000 words. When I started out I wanted  to do a 20-chapter story that would last 100,000 words. To hit the  goal I set for myself at the beginning I had to average 5,000 words a  chapter, not easy when half your chapters are only 2,000 - 4,000  words long. To set myself a good point I will now be making my  chapters about 5,000 words long as a general rule.</p><p>I never expected the story to be as long as it is  going to be, but I really don't have much of a choice. One of the  problems I have with stories is how short scenes are, all that  happens is an action that relates to the plot, there are no details  that help immerse you into the story.</p><p>This chapter is about 10,000 words long, and that  is just a little tedious, it is much easier to do shorter chapters  and tie several of them in together. One such thing I could have done  was make a chapter for each of the chaos gods and their respective  Ranma character. Perhaps I will go back after I finish the story and  redo this, probably not.</p><p>The four gods of chaos are seen as extremely evil  entities. Khorne is the blood god, lord of slaughter chose Ryoga.  Slaanesh is the dark prince, prince of all dark and unholy pleasures  she/he chose Kodachi, Tzeentch is known as the changer of the ways,  master of dark magic and mutation, he chose Gosunkugi.</p><p>The Count is based off of the vampires in the  Warhammer world also, I thought about what type of vampire I wished  to insert, it came down too a choice between a Warhammer Vampire  Count, or a Vampire from the World of Darkness, created by White  Wolf. In the end I decided that I liked Warhammer's variety more  than I did White Wolf.</p><p>As for Ryoga not knowing what the vampire really  was, well keep in mind Ryoga, like Ranma has been on the road since  he was young, as such he might not know quite the same cultural  stories as a normal person. Also Ryoga has been known to jump to  rather wild conclusions, much like the rest of the cast.</p><p>For an excellent story based around the Warhammer  40K universe, I would recommend the Ranma ½ fanfic, <i>The  Primarch Of Chaos</i>, it is the best WH 40K fanfic I have found that  relates to the Ranma ½ universe, if anyone knows of others I  would love to read them.</p><p>The four gods of chaos and everything from the  Warhammer universe are property of Games Workshop and I in no way  claim ownership nor am I making any money off of this. On a side note  I started up a Battle Fleet Gothic Necron fleet and am very happy  with it so far. My only regret is that there aren't enough people  who play the game for my tastes.</p><p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would  love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In  case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and  if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with  anyone so interested. If you do send me an e-mail to me please put  'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want  me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to  contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible.  Thanks.</p><p>-Rhuobhe26</p>
