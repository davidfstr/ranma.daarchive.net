</div><p>One Last Chance ch.3<p>Revised<p>Of Fiancées and Sisters<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it, and even if I was I wouldn't be dumb enough to actually say I was.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames; I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>'Thoughts'<p><b>Scene change/flashback</b><p><i>Signs</i></p><p><b>Summary</b><p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter Akane and Ranma confessed their feelings for each other and shared their first kiss. Now on with the story.<p><b>Tendo House</b><p>"Are you that girl from before?" Nabiki asked. They were all sitting in the living room.<p>"Ahh yes, where to begin." Genma reached over to grab his son, only to have his hands intercepted and sent flying into the koi pond.<p>"Oh my own father, so humiliating, so humiliating to his own son," Nabiki, Kasumi, and Soun all stared at the koi pond, while Akane tried not to laugh at Ranma's role reversal.<p>"It happened two weeks ago in China at the cursed training grounds of a place called Jusenkyo." Ranma began.<p><b>Flashback, a real flashback this time not a confusing back or forwards flash</b><p>Of course we've all seen this bit written, drawn, or animated more times than most care to remember, so I think we will skip this little bit of the story. For those of you who don't know what happens, read the manga, watch the anime, or take a pretty good guess as to what happens.<p><b>End flashback, Tendo House<br/></b><p>"And so thanks to this idiot here we're cursed. Cold water activates the curse while hot water reverses it." Soun moved over to pat Ranma on the back.<p>"No sweat. Your problem isn't so terrible after all!" Soun says cheerily, patting Ranma on the back.<p>"How so?" Ranma replied. Akane saw that Ranma was trying very hard to suppress a grin.<p>"My daughter Kasumi, nineteen, and Nabiki, seventeen, and Akane, sixteen. Pick the one you want and she's your fiancée." Nabiki and Kasumi were behind Akane in an instant at their father's words.<p>"Oh he wants Akane," Kasumi chirped.<p>"Oh yeah he definitely wants Akane." Akane remained quiet knowing full well whom Ranma would choose, not that it mattered anyway.<p>"May I talk to the three of you upstairs privately," he asked.<p>"Of course," Kasumi replied, standing up and walking out of the room, heading for the stairs. Nabiki, Akane, and Ranma followed. When they got upstairs they all went into Nabiki's room.<p>"Umm could you give Akane and I just a second please?" Ranma asked, pulling Akane out of the room and shutting the door, surprising the other two sisters.<p>"Hmm, looks like he and our little sister come to an agreement already," Nabiki smirked.<p>"Oh my."<p>On the other side of the door, Akane was fuming. "What's the big idea, why didn't you just choose me?"<p>"Because of your sisters."<p>"What about them?" Akane asked through clenched teeth. 'If he decided to try for one of my sisters after what he told me, I'm going to kill him.' Her hand clenched into a fist as she got ready to beat some sense into her fiancé.<p>"Well I'm pretty sure our fathers are too clueless to notice what would be a sudden change in our behavior, not that they'd care even if they did if it meant uniting the schools, but I'm pretty sure your sisters would notice the change in you." Akane gasped, she hadn't thought of that.</p><p>"It's not very likely I would suddenly go from hating all boys to being happily engaged at the drop of a hat. So what should we do?"<p>"I think we should tell them the truth." He held up his hand forestalling her next comment.<p>"Think about it, who can keep our parents in line like Kasumi, and then there's Nabiki. She's one of the reasons it was so hard for us back then. If we have her on our side, it might just work out a bit better this time round." Akane nodded.<p>"I'm not so sure about that, I think I have a better idea, just follow my lead ok." They opened the door and stepped inside, Ranma following Akane.<p>"OK, spill it Saotome, who do you choose and why did you want to talk to us?"<p>"Chill Nabiki, he chooses me so calm down." Akane says, waving her sister to silence.<p>"You're taking this pretty well sis, I thought you hated guys."<p>"I did, but things change."<p>Kasumi and Nabiki looked in shock from Akane to Ranma and back. 'Wow, if he got Akane over her thing with boys in a couple of hours he must be something, maybe we should give the engagement a try.'<p>"That's nice do you know each other from before now?" Nabiki looked at her older sister in shock, other thoughts had been in her mind.<p>"Yes we do." She swung her head back to look at Ranma.<p>"Ok, spill, it's obvious you're hiding something."<p>Ranma sighed, might as go with the straightforward approach. Outside of battle he'd never been much for subtlety anyway.<p>"Ranma and I have known each other for a while now." Nabiki raised an eyebrow.<p>"Oh, then how come we've never met him before. I thought you were on a training trip for the last few years." Nabiki asked skeptically, she'd always been very good at reading people and these two were hiding something.</p><p>"Oh my Akane, it's not proper to keep a boyfriend hidden for so long." Kasumi chided in a motherly fashion.<p>Akane sighed at her older sisters' words.<p>"I know Kasumi, but think of what would have happened if Kuno had found out that there was some guy out there that I cared about. He would have started searching the world to kill him. He'd probably say that Ranma here was some kind of sorcerer and that he had enslaved me."</p><p>Everyone paused for a moment to consider this, Nabiki had to grudgingly admit that what her sister said sounded exactly like the kind of hair brained logic that Kuno would come up with. Ranma and Akane didn't have to try very hard having plenty of experience dealing with the delusional samurai.<p>"Alright then, that's a really good reason why you didn't tell anyone, but it still doesn't answer my original question, if Ranma-kun here has been off on a training trip for the last several years then how do you know him?" Nabiki pressed, 'something doesn't feel right here, but what is it?'<p>"Well I used to live around here when I was younger, my mother and pops had a place not too far from here." Ranma provided, thankfully this was all the truth, otherwise he was sure that his horrible poker face would have given him away.<p>"Oh my, little Ranma-chan, it really is you." Kasumi smiled, a real smile, not the vacant expression that she usually wore.</p><p>"You know him?" the younger two sisters asked, both honestly surprised.</p><p>'She knows him,' Nabiki thought to herself, 'how would Kasumi know someone so much younger than herself?'</p><p>'She knows him,' Akane questioned silently panicking, 'when and how, and why did she never say anything when he came last time?'</p><p>"Oh yes, back when Mother was alive," a wistful look passed over Kasumi's face, "she'd take the three of us to a park nearby and watch us play. Ranma used to be there and you two would play together all the time. Ranma-kun would poke you or call you a name and you would chase him around the park trying to hit him with a little plastic hammer until you both tired yourselves out. I never would have even thought of it if you hadn't mentioned living so close."</p><p>Thankfully for the young couple the two older Tendo sisters were lost in their own thoughts and never noticed the surprised expressions on their faces.</p><p>'We've known each other for that long.' Akane thought, 'I never realized it before.'</p><p>"But you were so young Akane, I'm surprised you and Ranma-kun remember that far back."</p><p>"Well Kasumi, some things just stay with you over the years," chuckled Ranma, looking anything but innocent.<p>"So this is what you want little sister? Do you truly want this?" Nabiki asked, moving her eyes from her sister to Ranma and back. "You really want to be engaged to him?"<p>In response to her sister's question, Akane smiled and leaned against the pig-tailed martial artist behind her. He in turn, wrapped his arms around her. The other two Tendos were shocked by their youngest sister's open display of affection.</p><p>"No Nabiki, I don't want to just be engaged to him. One day I want to be married to him."</p><p>"Oh my Akane, this is so sudden."</p><p>"Shhh Sis," Nabiki scolded, pulling her older sister close, "do you really want to be engaged to him?"</p><p>"Oh no, he's far too young for me."</p><p>"Then lets allow the two of them to do this on their own," whispered the middle Tendo, "we can always step in if we need to, but for now let's just let them find their own way."</p><p>"Alright Nabiki, if you think it's for the best."</p><p>"I do," leaning back she said to the couple, "Well Akane you have my support. You can be his fiancé and we won't object to this."</p><p>This caused the young pair to release a breath that neither had realized they had been holding. The approval of Akane's sisters would make everything a lot easier</p><p>"You have my support in this too, just don't do anything improper before you two marry, OK."<p>Akane flushed beet red at her sister's implications.<p>"KASUMI!"<p>"Come on Akane, let's go break our choice to your father and my old man," Ranma said, dragging a still blushing Akane with him as he went.<p>No sooner had they set foot into the living room than Ranma was immediately confronted by his father.</p><p>"So boy, made your decision yet?" Ranma sighed at his father.<p>"Yeah pops, WE have," He stated, clearly putting a lot of emphasis into the 'we' part.<p>"So son, who did you pick?"<p>"Sorry Mr. Tendo, I can't choose any of them since I'm already engaged."<p>"WHAT?" the four Tendos yelled.<p>Genma merely paled. 'Oh No, does the boy actually remember one of those engagements I made. This could cause trouble who is it, the Ukyo girl or one of the others.'<p>"Boy who is this girl you're engaged to?" his father growled, 'I can't let all my hard work go down the drain just because the boy happens to remember one measly promise.'<p>Ranma was using the soul of ice to keep from cracking up then and there.<p>"Pops, let me introduce you to my fiancée, Akane Tendo." Ranma took Akane's hand and bowed to his father, but not very deeply. "With your approval of course Mr. Tendo."<p>Soun just nodded in shock before saying, "of course son you have my permission to marry my daughter."<p>"So that means you support Ranma's proposal and Akane's acceptance?" Nabiki asked, a mischievous gleam in her eye.<p>"Of course we can have the marriage ready by tomorrow." Soun beamed proudly, whipping out his victory fans.<p>"But father, isn't it customary to wait at least a week to a year minimum after a couple meet for an arranged marriage?" Kasumi pointed out.<p>"That's ok Kasumi, there's no need to wait so long since they both agree to the marriage." Soun countered, 'I thought we'd have to fight them tooth and nail to get them to accept this, we figured it would take at least a year just to get them to accept the engagement.'<p>"You're right dad there's no need for the regular wait period." Akane agreed.<p>"See there, just let me call the minister and we can." Soun was cut off by Akane.<p>"Since this isn't an arranged marriage Ranma and I can take as long as we want."<p>"WHAT?" Genma and Soun yelled.<p>"Ranma proposed to me before you asked him to choose, therefore this isn't an arranged marriage. Sorry dad, but I want to plan my own wedding and it'll take me longer than a week. We will do things at Ranma and my pace, understand?"<p>Soun began to shrink away from his daughters as they teamed up against him.<p>"But the schools must be combined," he tried to argue. Soun looked over to his 'best friend' for support, all he saw was a panda playing with a beach ball.<p>"They will be joined, but since you and pops accepted my proposal and engagement already you let us take it out of the families' hands and left it up to Akane and I instead." Ranma's voice was calm and almost friendly, but there was a certain edge of steel to it.<p>"Of course you could always make them break their personal engagement and reinstate the family's in its place." Soun relaxed.<p>"That's true enough, eh Saotome?" Genma had changed himself back as soon as things began to go his way.<p>"Definitely Tendo."<p>"Of course that means I'll have to speed up my bridal training. I'll cook 'EVERY' meal from now on." Akane put a lot of stress behind the word every. Genma couldn't understand why everyone else in the room had gone pale.<p>"I don't see any prob-," Genma was forcefully cut off when Soun, Nabiki, and even Kasumi placed their hands over his mouth. Thankfully everyone was to busy with Genma to see that his son had paled as well.<p>"That's fine Akane, I'm sure you and your fiancée can handle it, if you need our help don't hesitate to ask." Her father placated.<p>"But Tendo, the schools," Genma was cut off again, this time by Soun's withering glare.<p>"I'll explain later, but suffice to say that I want to live long enough to see the schools joined." Soun whispered into his ear. "Besides, just by having them agree to be married the plan is already a year ahead of schedule. We have plenty of time left."</p><p>Genma nodded in grudging agreement. 'The plan is already ahead of schedule after all, besides I can work on the boy, I'm sure he'll listen to my sage advice and marry the girl.'<p>Akane was rather upset, just because they had the hazmat team's number memorized, knew all the operators at the poison control center on a first name basis, and even because it had taken two teams from the animal control center to apprehend and put down a casserole when it had tried to take a bite out of Kuno, didn't mean she wasn't getting better.<p>Before they died Ranma had actually begun to enjoy her curry. Even though everyone else thought it was a little too spicy at least he ate it. This was in no small part due to the phoenix pill and soul of ice, Ranma was able to withstand the sheer spiciness that would otherwise boil blood, of course Akane didn't need to know this fact.<p>"Calm down Akane, we got them to back off, now we can deal with the other problems as they come." Ranma whispered into her ear.<p>He was right, she knew he was right, but she was still angry.<p>"Ranma. Dojo. NOW." She growled heading to the dojo, a blue glow surrounding her body. Ranma followed silently, noticing her battle aura expand and contract as she tried to calm down, but not quite succeeding at the task.<p>When they got into the dojo, Akane just stood there trying to control her breathing. Taking a risk Ranma put his hand on her shoulder. She spun around at his touch.<p>Ranma reflexively closed his eyes and raised his arms in warding.<p>"I'm not going to hit you Ranma."<p>"Promise?"<p>"Yes."<p>He lowered his arms to see Akane standing in front of him with a hurt expression.<p>"Am I really that bad?"<p>"Huh?" There were so many painful answers, a few safe answers, and little else he could say to that question.<p>"Cooking and my temper, am I really that bad?"<p>"Yeah Akane you are. You were getting better; if you could learn some control then you'd be much better, but it has got to be something you want, it can't be something you're forced into."<p>Ranma remembered trying to teach Akane using some of the same incentives his father used. He had spent several nights in Dr. Tofu's clinic recovering from his attempts and he wasn't quite ready to repeat the experience.<p>"As for cooking, you're getting better at it, you just need to keep practicing."<p>"Thanks Ranma, I don't know if I can do this though. I don't know if I can go through all the fiancées, rivals, kidnappings, and other crazy things that happen. I came so close to loosing you several times, I don't know if I can go through that again. I lost you once before, I know I couldn't take it if I lost you again."<p>Akane was practically crying. She was barely able to hold back the tears. Seeing this Ranma did something he wouldn't have dared try before he died.<p>After all dieing changes a person's outlook on life. While no one else can corroborate this since as far as they were aware Ranma and Akane were the only people to go through this. So for the sake of argument we'll let Ranma get away with it,<p>He gathered Akane into his arms, holding her to his chest. She responded by grabbing onto him and crying into his shirt.<p>"Don't worry Akane, this time we know what's coming and when it's coming. We'll face it together and we'll beat it." Akane favored him with a smile for his kind words.<p>"Really?" He in turn returned her smile.<p>"Really," he assured her.<p><b>Somewhere else</b><p>"Oh no my dears, that just isn't going to happen. We didn't go through all the trouble of rescuing you, just to let things get boring. You might be Loki's favored, but that doesn't mean we're going to let you get away with no entertainment." A figure that sat watching the two chuckled to itself.<p>"Are you sure interfering would be a good idea. I mean after all the trouble they got into last time do we really need to make it worse on them. Even the lord and lady of battle keep their interventions to a minimum where these two are involved. You know how easy to provoke the chaos lot are."<p>"Of course I'm sure, now did you get it?"<p>The second figure pulled out a folder from its robes and handed it to the first. The recipient looked at the folder in its hand. The folder was easily several inches thick.<p>"This is a list of all the women his father engaged him too?"<p>"Not quite."<p>"What do you mean, not quite, what else is in here?"<p>"Actually all of the people in that file are supposed fiancées."<p>"But.-" prompted the first figure.<p>"That is only A-G." The first figure face faulted.<p>"Where are the other files?"<p>The other smiled and began producing more files of similar size.<p>"You know I can see why the love gods take such pride in this kid, but still hate the mention of him."<p>TBC, the end of chapter 3<p>AN: Well that's another chapter completed in the story. I really enjoy the reviews and am very pleased with the number of reviews it has received so far. This has given me even more incentive to get more chapters out faster. Thank you for all the criticism I have received as well, it is a big help and I fixed some grammatical errors in chapter 2 thanks to one astute readers observations.<p>Don't worry, the list of characters will expand come next chapter. I'm sure many of you are in anticipation over the first day of school and Kuno, two of the issues I will be addressing in the next chapter.<p>This fic has been compared with Lord Archive's "Second Chances" along with several other fan fictions. I in no way intend to copy any of these stories. All these stories have more or less the same method and means for going back, generally involving the deaths of one or more of the cast. My story also has these things and as this story goes on you will see more and more differences between my fic and the others, I would say more, but it will be a lot more enjoyable to let you see what I mean for yourself.<p>This fic is going to have a lot of WAFF in it, that is unavoidable, I am going to try and keep this from being a "senseless Akane/Ranma romance" as one reviewer so aptly stated. There is a plot that will become more and more obvious besides the whole. 'Let's see if we can make it past the two year mark this time.'<p>I enjoy reading the review so keep them coming. If you want to talk to me and have me respond, please e-mail me at and state you want me to respond. I might not otherwise.<p>Thank you, and enjoy the fic.<p>Revision Notes:</p><p>The largest change in this chapter is that Nabiki and Kasumi were originally told that Ranma and Akane came from the future. I always felt this was a bit of a cop out on my part. The more people who knew about it the easier writing the story would be, however this also limited certain things that could be done with the characters. Over the next few chapters I came to regret having the two of them in on the whole thing. I originally intended that neither of them found out and I am going with that feeling.</p><p>From this point on the changes from the original and the revision will become more and more obvious.</p><p>Another change I am making is that originally I ended every chapter with the two mysterious figures and having them laugh. Reading through it and having written it I find this was way too forced and expected. It also served to make the two seem like nothing more than comic relief without actually adding anything too the story, while the two will have a role to play I am going to stop ending every chapter with the two of them laughing. Running gags only work if done properly, this one was not.</p><p>There was another Ranma 1/2 story I was working on that used several gods and goddesses as main and secondary characters and this story started to combine both fics together. Reading back through I see that my original ideas for One Last Chance started looking more and more like my other story. With each chapter I wrote the fact that they had traveled through time seemed less and less important. This was one of the reasons I stopped, because it was a great disservice to both stories to be lumped together like I had done as they both were pretty good as stand alone tales. As such while divine beings will still play a role, I do not wish this to turn into a Hercules or Xena style story. Ranma and Akane have more than enough on their plates already without a gaggle of Olympians throwing much more.</p>
