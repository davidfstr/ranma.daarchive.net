</div>One Last Chance ch.18<p>`<p>**** The game of chance ****<p>`<p>`<p>`<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>`<p>`<p>`<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>'Thoughts'<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>`<p>` ` ` ` Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. Nabiki is now stuck in an engagement to Kuno. Ranma's curse was revealed to his mother and she has allowed him to live, temporarily. After a day of school, which the two actually managed to make on time for a change they went to a nearby Ice cream shop where they encountered Azusa Shiratori and Mikado Sanzenin, The Golden Pair. After a brief difference of opinions as to the ownership of Akane's engagement ring were challenged to a match by Ranma and Akane. The one catch however is that it is a martial arts match and not a martial arts skating match. ` ` ` ` `<p>"In everything a person does there is chance, the chance to succeed or the chance to fail, sometimes there are numerous results to any one chance, the slightest change in something will change chance, a pebble thrown in a lake can change fishing conditions for miles around. The beating of a butterfly's wings in Tokyo could change the wind slightly eventually causing a hurricane to hit the eastern seaboard of America, or change the course of a kicked ball in a football game causing it to swing outside the goal, or maybe swing inside the post just enough, or there could be no effect whatsoever, such is chance." ` ` ` ` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo house, Evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` ` "We're home." Ranma and Akane called as they entered the house, kicking off their shoes and looking forward to a nice relaxing evening before another madhouse day tomorrow.<p>"Ranma, Akane, I'm glad your home, father and Mr. Saotome are waiting for you in the living room."<p>Both teenage martial artists groaned as a sense of déjà vu filled them.<p>"They don't have a priest waiting with them in there do they?" Ranma asked.<p>"Oh my no, I didn't see one in there." Kasumi responded.<p>"Then let's go face them." Akane muttered moving off towards the obvious trap their parents had set for the two of them.<p>"The priest is waiting in the dojo." Kasumi said to Ranma and Akane's retreating backs, her soft words going unnoticed by the two.<p>"Ok pops, what's this all about?" Ranma asked as he turned the corner and entered the living room.<p>He and Akane found nothing but an empty room waiting them and their questions.<p>After a moment of surprise the two went back-to-back glancing all around and up, looking for their sneaky parents and anything that the old men might try.<p>After a few moments and nothing seeming out of place the two relaxed slightly.<p>"Hmm, I wonder what that might be?" Akane asked, gesturing to a pair of small packages on the table.<p>Carefully the two slid over to the table, carefully watching for any traps, which their respective parents might have set for the two of them.<p>{ Dear Ranma and Akane,<p>As a way of saying good luck and wishing you well with your courtship, here are a pair of gifts that will assist you in holy matrimony and the promise of uniting the schools.<p>Love your devoted fathers. }<p>"Hmm, maybe the last beating actually knocked some sense into them, but obviously not too much since their still harping on about marriage." Ranma stated holding up his package and beginning to unwrap it.<p>"Well at least they're going to back off some, so at least that's one advantage." Akane replied, picking up her own package and examining it before beginning to unwrap the parcel.<p>A puff of smoke from Ranma's package gave Akane enough warning that she was able to hold her breath and keep from inhaling too much of the airborne dust that escaped from the package.<p>"." Akane gasps out before she falls to the ground slumping against her descending fiancée who was already unconscious. Darkness began to creep into her vision as she fought to stay conscious.<p>"We got them Tendo, they accepted our marriage gifts, now to the dojo before they change their minds."<p>"Sure thing Saotome."<p>The voice of her father and the feeling of being gently lifted were the last things Akane heard and felt before the darkness completely claimed her.<p>With their stubborn children asleep Genma and Soun made their way towards the dojo and the awaiting priest, pausing only briefly to drop the soon to be married couple of in a pair of wheel chairs before entering the dojo.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo, A few minutes later ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ranma's fortified constitution was already kicking in and getting rid of the sedatives in his system after only a little time. He began to return to consciousness and get a bearing for his surroundings.<p>While he was unable to move or see his hearing was beginning to return and he focused on that sense to return the rest of him to normality.<p>"Do you Ranma Saotome take Akane Tendo to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold for better or for worse, in sickness and in health until death do you part?"<p>'Wait, why are they asking me that question, I was in the living room with Akane, not a church.' Ranma tried to ask a question, but no words would come from his unresponsive mouth.<p>"Yes he does."<p>'What, that's not my voice, that's pops voice, what the hell is he doing answering for me. Pops when I get up I'm going to put you down.'<p>Trying to clench his teeth, but unable to force his muscles to respond, Ranma put every possible effort into regaining the use of his mouth. He could barely feel his jaw, but it wouldn't respond to his brain's frantic demands.<p>"And do you Akane Tendo take Ranma Saotome to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold for better or worse, in sickness and in health until death do you part?"<p>'Wait, is Akane actually going through with this?' Ranma paused his attempts to regain consciousness to hear her response.<p>"Yes she does," replied a voice that wasn't Akane's.<p>'Damn Mr. Tendo, if I get up they're both dead men.'<p>Ranma's body began to glow faintly from his effort to speak. Akane was probably in a worse situation than he was. All Ranma knew was that he had to stop his wedding to Akane so that he and Akane could get married later.<p>"If anyone objects to the union of these two please speak now or forever hold your peace."<p>"I object," a new voice rung out in the bare silence which followed the priest's proclamation.<p>"For what reason and on what grounds?" The surprised and slightly nervous priest asked the newcomer who had kicked down the doors to the dojo. The doors, which had been chained and reinforced by metal to the dojo, were now laying flat on the floor from where the newcomer had entered.<p>"On the grounds that I'm here to kill Ranma Saotome and I don't want to make that girl a widow."<p>'Wow, I never thought I'd be thankful for Ryoga's obsession to kill me.' Ranma idly thought to himself while still forcing his body to respond.<p>"You would murder a helpless boy in a coma?" Asked the priest.<p>'Well that explains how they convinced the priest to do this ceremony.' A small part of Ranma's mind idly commented while the rest of him was intent on moving.<p>The red glow Ranma was giving off caught the attention of the priest who had been focused on the fanged devil, which had burst through the door.<p>"They're both possessed," the priest mumbled while drawing himself back against the far wall of the dojo trying to put as much between the fanged boy and the glowing comatose boy as possible.<p>"Listen here, we're trying to get our children married peacefully, why don't you just leave?" Soun asked this strange boy who had intruded into his home and interrupted his little girl's wedding, oh the trials of a loving father and what he had to go through for his dear  daughter who looked so much like his dear departed wife.<p>Just the thought of his departed beloved almost sent Soun into tears. 'No Tendo, you're not going to cry, you're so close to uniting the schools and seeing your daughter happily married.' Soun withheld his tears for the betterment of his family.<p>Ranma began to work his jaw up and down, he could almost talk, but he just couldn't get his vocal chords to work.<p>"Tadaima," a very feminine and familiar voice wafted in through the open door frame of the dojo.<p>'Oh great and I thought things couldn't get any worse' Ranma thought to himself.<p>Soun and Ryoga glanced over to see Genma turn even whiter than his gi, curious expressions on their faces<p>The priest didn't really hear the new voice through his prayers, although he did offer a few thanks when the glow around the pigtailed boy winked out. Renewing them as the girl now began to glow.<p>'Oh no, she isn't going to take him away, not now, not while I can't defend him.' Akane had also been trying to get herself to move or say something since before Ranma had even woken up, although she wasn't aware of his return to consciousness.<p>"Oh hello Mrs. Saotome, Mr. Saotome and Ranma are in the dojo with father, Akane, and a guest."<p>All in the dojo could hear the approaching footsteps, except the priest. To Ranma and Genma it sounded like the approach of the grim reaper.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Nerima, a few blocks away ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>A man cloaked in black sneezed, a surprising gesture for a being, which had no lungs, throat, or nose. He paused a moment to think on it before shrugging it off and continuing on his way.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Back at the Dojo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Ranma, Mr. Saotome, you have a guest." Kasumi's voice was right outside the dojo.<p>Genma's brain was screaming at him to move, to hide, to go panda, or at least to do something, anything as long as it got him away from here. Unfortunately the warring suggestions and panic within him froze the older Saotome male into inaction.<p>"Konbanwan," Nodoka greeted as she entered the dojo. She paused and then did a double take.<p>On the floor in the corner of a dojo was a priest who was praying fervently to his god. Close by the holy man was her son and his fiancée, both appeared to be unconscious and very nicely dressed, although Akane was glowing with a slight red aura.<p>In the middle of the room stood Genma and his friend Soun, but what really got Nodoka's attention was the young man standing just beyond the door, glancing at her over his shoulder.<p>HIM, he was the one who told her those lies about her son. He was the one who got her riled up and angry, tainting her view of her own son before she had even met Ranma.<p>The boy who even now turned his head away from her as if she didn't matter.<p>Ryoga shrugged the woman off, she was Ranma's mother, but he suspected after their discussion the other day that she shared his view of Ranma and wouldn't stop him.<p>"Out of my way old men, I owe Ranma and I intend to pay him back in full."<p>* Shink *<p>The sound of a blade being drawn slowly from a sheath makes a very distinctive sound that even those who have never heard it can easily guess as to what the sound was.<p>At the sound Genma's blood froze and he had to keep himself breathing through force of will alone.<p>Ranma, although he couldn't see her knew his mother had just drawn her sword and braced himself for whatever would come next.<p>Soun was caught between shock and the urge to cry, he wasn't sure why he wanted to cry, but felt it might be a good idea so he stood there in silence.<p>Akane increased her struggling, she had to stop Ranma's mother from forcing Ranma to commit Seppuku, which had to be the reason she was here. 'After all why else would she be here except to take Ranma away from me, just like everyone else.'<p>Ryoga smirked to himself, if he was right the woman would hold the two older men still while he finished Ranma, then she would be free of such a stain on her family's honour.<p>The smirk fell from his face when he felt the touch of the cold steel against the front of his neck.<p>"Saotome-san, what?" Ryoga was interrupted by Nodoka.<p>"Listen to me you honourless little pig," Nodoka spat out the words, Ranma internally smiled at Nodoka's use of the pig knowing what its effect would be on Ryoga, "because of what you told me I came here and almost took my son's life. I only just got to see my son after him being taken from me more than a decade ago. Leave here now and I will forget my anger for now. Stay and it will mean a blood feud between our families."<p>While Ranma couldn't feel anything besides his jaw, he could swear the temperature in the room had just dropped at Nodoka's words.<p>Ryoga was about to argue with the woman, after all he was right, wasn't he, but Nodoka pulled the katana back, barely nicking the skin of Ryoga's jugular with it's razor sharp blade.<p>"Fine I'll go," Ryoga muttered darkly.<p>Nodoka removed the katana from his neck, but didn't sheath it.<p>Ryoga backed out of the dojo, casting a glance back in at Ranma before he left the dojo heading for the front gate.<p>By the time he reached the front gate Ryoga was deep in thought. 'Why, why do so many people jump to Ranma's aid, can't they see that he's a bad person and the cause of my problems, I'm sure he's causing them some problems as well.'<p>Ryoga continued his train of thought as he walked down the street away from the dojo. 'He is the cause of my problems, isn't he? Isn't he?'<p>"WELL ISN'T HE?" Ryoga didn't even sound completely convinced himself as he yelled the question.<p>So caught up in thinking Ryoga didn't noticed he'd wandered into the middle of a crowd.<p>"Huh?" Ryoga asked looking around.<p>People were pushing past him in quite a hurry.<p>"Where am I now?" Ryoga groaned, looking around till he could see a sign.<p>{Pamplona}<p>"Hmm, I wonder where Pamplona is?" Ryoga asked no one in particular.<p>'Hmm, why is everyone running, and what are they running?' Ryoga wondered trying to see past the people. He could see that almost all of them were Hispanic, which meant he was either in America or Europe.<p>Ryoga tried catching the arm of one of the people, but they were running to fast and jostling him out of the way almost as if they didn't see him or didn't care.<p>Suddenly part of the crowd in front of him split and the largest bulls Ryoga had seen in his life were heading straight for him.<p>"Is this really Ranma's fault?" Ryoga asked himself rather calmly as if he had reached a sudden epiphany.<p>Then the first bull hit him.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Back in Nerima, Tendo Dojo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Dear husband," Nodoka's voice just dripped with sugary sweetness.<p>"Yes wife," replied a man who knew that no one, except maybe his ungrateful son, who would try and make a panda talk.<p>"Why are my son and his fiancée strapped to those wheelchairs, and what is that priest doing here?" If anything the sweetness of her voice increased to dangerous levels.<p>"They are getting married like good children and fulfilling their father's pledges to unite the schools." Soun threw in, completely missing the rising tension in the room, which most normal people would notice.<p>"So you're marrying your daughter and my son?"<p>Genma and Soun nodded dumbly.<p>"Together?"<p>The dubious duo nodded.<p>"Where are the witnesses?"<p>Soun pointed at the ceiling.<p>Everyone who could move turned their eyes to the ceiling to see Daisuke and Hiroshi hanging suspended by a rope.<p>"We just came to say hi and they jumped us." Daisuke wailed seeing that their eyes were upon him. This really wasn't his week.<p>"Shhhh, this is getting interesting." Hiroshi admonished his friend; this was better than the movies.<p>Sweatdrops grew on the back of the group on the floor, including Ranma and Akane who recognized the voices.<p>"Oh, where are Akane's sisters?"<p>"They went out shopping for food." Soun responded weakly to Nodoka's question.<p>"And finally," everyone felt the temperature in the room drop with Nodoka's words, "you didn't even tell me about my son's wedding, you wanted me to miss the wedding of my only son?"<p>Any protests Genma might have been able to think of stuck in his throat as he realized he had just made a fatal mistake with his and Soun's plan.<p>Genma backed up slowly from the raging woman in front of him, joining the priest huddled against the back of the dojo.<p>Soun not quite aware of the danger he was in, although when Nodoka began glowing in anger he did get the vague sense of something wrong.<p>"Well you're here now Saotome-san so we can continue with the wedding to join our two clans."<p>Ranma hearing Soun's words became worried, he didn't know whether or not his mother would support Soun and his father or not.<p>The powder was rapidly fading from his body and he had slight control over his body again. Ranma tried to turn his head so he could actually see what was going on. Unfortunately this just resulted in his head lolling forwards at an angle.<p>Nodoka noticed her sons head slip forwards, it brought her attention away from the Tendo patriarch and towards the fact her son was tied to a wheelchair.<p>Striding past Soun, Nodoka walks to her son, walking around the wheelchair to face him. Gently she lifts his face to look him in the eye. To her surprise and ire, she saw his eyes were cloudy and not clearly focused on her.<p>Ranma tried to move say something, but all he succeeded was moving his jaw up and down. Unfortunately seeing her son unable to speak merely fueled Nodoka's anger.<p>"Husband dearest," Nodoka's voice dripped with sarcasm, "would you mind explaining to me why our son is drugged."<p>Genma froze under the gaze of his wife, feeling much like a field mouse does when coming face to face with a king Cobra.<p>"Well dear, he was a little reluctant to go through with the ceremony and so Tendo and I decided to give him something to calm his nerves." Genma lied easily even though he couldn't take his eyes of the bare katana.<p>"And his fiancée?" Nodoka queried, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to Akane.<p>"Well she also had a case of pre-wedding jitters and we thought  ikeanygirlwouldwantafterall."<p>"You're talking quite fast Mr. Tendo." Nodoka confronted Soun, ending the tirade coming out of his mouth.<p>"..." Soun was speechless, opening and closing his mouth and doing quite a good impression of a fish.<p>"Release my son and his fiancée now or else."<p>Genma's mind was racing, scheming, trying to figure out how he could get his ungrateful boy married without his own disobedient wife stopping them. Unfortunately Genma knew Nodoka well enough that she would not bend on this issue.<p>"Well Genma, are you going to release them or will I have too do what your honourless self will not."<p>Genma mentally jumped for joy as he realized the one thing he could get leverage on Nodoka with was right in front of him.<p>"Wife, this is a matter of honour, the uniting of the Saotome and Tendo clans, I will not allow you to stain the honour of our clans with your actions."<p>Nodoka reeled back as if struck by her husband's words, taking a step back and lowering her head so her hair fell over her eyes.<p>Genma smirked while Ranma despaired; both knew how important honour was to the Saotome Matriarch and Genma had dragged not only their family's honour, but also the Tendo family's honour into it.<p>Genma gestured for the priest to continue with the ceremony. Only to notice the priest wasn't paying attention, as he was too interested in praying for his own salvation.<p>"no"<p>Genma walked over to the priest, missing the inaudible word Nodoka had whispered.<p>"no."<p>"What was that Nodoka?" Genma asked, turning to face his wife.<p>"No." Nodoka said more vehemently.<p>"What do you mean 'no'?" Genma said moving over to face and confront his wife. He knew she was clutching at threads, no one who believed in honour as much as his wife would stop a matter of honour such as this.<p>"No!" Nodoka replied, still keeping her head down, eyes hidden behind dark hair.<p>"Why not, this is a matter of honour, we can't back out from a matter of honour. The schools must be joined."<p>"NO!" Nodoka's head jerked up, bright flames burning within her eyes, staring straight into the eyes of her husband.<p>"bu...but," Genma stammered.<p>"But nothing husband, where the hell do you think you can get off talking to me about honour, he has only known about this arranged marriage for a couple of weeks at most. How did you expect him to deal with knowing he would be forced to live with a girl he has never even met without time to adjust?"<p>"Arranged weddings are very honourable and the boy should accept that."<p>"Honourable like our wedding," Genma flinched at Nodoka's words and backed off slightly.<p>"You remember our wedding don't you, the one which happened after you petitioned my father for a private meeting to discuss our marriage."<p>Genma too another step back.<p>"I have no idea what you did or said to him, but he refused your proposal and banned you from ever seeing me again."<p>Nodoka began to follow Genma, taking a step forwards for every step he took back.<p>"We eloped do you remember, we eloped and my father disowned me."<p>Genma had been backed to a wall with his normally perfectly composed wife still advancing on him with fire in her eyes.<p>The Saotome patriarch tried to say something, but found that his voice wouldn't come to his defense. He tried to run away, but learned that his legs had turned to jelly and were barely able to keep him standing.<p>"I sacrificed my family honour to be with you. If our son has to do the same thing to be with the woman he loves, I will cope with that, but you husband dear, you will not force him and Akane Tendo together or try to trick him into getting married or I will enact the Seppuku contract just for you and you alone to fulfill do you understand me?" Nodoka's face was only inches away from Genma's own.<p>Genma was sweating heavily under his wife's torturous gaze.<p>"They're gone," Soun's voice broke the intense pressure building between the married couple's staring contest.<p>Turning their heads to look at where their children had been sitting greeted the parents, if any of them could truly claim the title, with nothing but two over turned and empty wheelchairs and the remains of the bindings.<p>"Akane, my dear Akane has run off and left her dear father, she ran away from her own wedding." Soun blubbered.<p>"Ranma, that ungrateful boy, how dare he dishonour his father so, why I should," Genma began to rant as he usually did, unfortunately he had forgotten one detail before he begun this tirade.<p>* Shink *<p>His wife.<p>"GENMA," Nodoka growled glaring at her husband venomously.<p>* Slice *<p>Genma ducked under the katana as it whistled past his head, slicing a long gash through the wall of the dojo easily.<p>"Now dear," Genma started to say, sliding along the wall, edging towards where the dojo's door used to be.<p>"Genma Saotome, prepare to die!" Nodoka yelled, charging her husband, fury blazing in her eyes.<p>Genma in a very rare show of manhood stood his ground.<p>For about two heartbeats before turning tail and running for his life. Genma blew out of the dojo moving as fast as his feet could carry him with Nodoka hot on his heels.<p>Soun just stood in the dojo crying his eyes out while the priest seeing his chance arrive, fled the dojo as fast as his own legs could carry him, pausing only long enough to leave the number for a good exorcist.<p>Soun remained in the dojo crying for a few more minutes until he was in danger of dehydration and left to get something strong to drink.<p>After all the drama in the dojo it had very quickly emptied of people each with their own intents.<p>"Alright, they're gone I think, it should be safe now." A voice from somewhere within the dojo said.<p>Two figures appeared lying on the floor of the dojo between the two wheelchairs, arms intertwined.<p>Akane sighed in contentment, just because they were safe, didn't mean she couldn't hold Ranma a little longer.<p>"Are you ok Ranma?" Akane asked her fiancée, voice full of concern.<p>Ranma who had taken in more of the gas than Akane was only able to nod very slightly and emit a very faint "fine".<p>Akane smiled benignly at her baka fiancée.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flashback to a few minutes ago, Tendo Dojo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>While their parents were distracting each other Akane's aura had singed enough of her ropes she could break free.<p>Unable to walk she had used the very handy wheels of the wheelchair where she moved herself over to Ranma and began working on his straps with her barely functional hands eventually managing to get them undone.<p>She had seen he was in even worse shape than she was and so she had tried to pull him onto her wheelchair so she could escape.<p>Unfortunately all this had accomplished was unbalancing both wheelchairs and spilling the two on the floor. Thankfully their parents were so caught up in their arguments they didn't notice, but the priest had. Fortunately for Ranma and Akane he stayed quiet while staring at the glowing devil comatose fiancés suddenly moving around.<p>Akane held on to Ranma with one arm and began dragging the two of them towards the exit and hopefully towards somewhere they could hide from their fathers and from Ranma's mother. "stop," Ranma was able to whisper out, "wait."<p>Akane had stopped crawling and turned to look at her fiancée who had his eyes shut and sweat beading on his forehead.<p>Ranma while unable to move had complete control over his chi. He began focusing as hard as the drugs in his system would allow him to. Mentally he worked through the steps of the umisenken without actually being able to go through them physically.<p>Akane almost gasp as she saw her father's eyes turn to where they were laying. When his eyes widened in surprise she knew that her father saw them. The gig was up as Soun turned back to speak with Ranma's arguing parents.<p>"They're gone," Soun's voice broke the intense pressure building between the married couple's staring contest.<p>All three adults turned their heads towards where Ranma and Akane lay, their gazes taking in the upset wheelchairs, the slipped bindings, but most importantly wandering unseeing over the two martial artists right in front of their eyes.<p>Soun was the first to speak.<p>"Akane, my dear Akane has run off and left her dear father, she ran away from her own wedding." He blubbered.<p>Chaos broke out soon after that statement when Genma interjected his own opinion and almost lost his head to Nodoka's katana.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Present, Tendo Dojo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"How long do you think it will be before we regain control of our bodies again?" Akane asked Ranma, not really expecting an answer, just wanting to lay there and get some sleep.<p>Ranma gave a very slight shrug as an answer.<p>"Yeah, that's what I thought." Akane sleepily answered, falling asleep after having worn herself out fighting to move her body.<p>"tomboy," Ranma weakly yet affectionately whispered before letting his eyelids drop and joining his fiancée in the bliss of sleep.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Within an onyx room two figures watched the goings on through a shimmering pool.<p>"Well that was anti-climactic if I do say so myself." The armoured figure stated, not looking up from the scene playing out before it.<p>"Not every situation can be solved with mass bloodshed and destruction." The cloaked figure replied with only partial levity.<p>The armoured figure looked up from the pool to face its counter-part whom was still huddled over the pool. A strange twinkle was in the blue eyes of the armoured figure.<p>"Why not, more controversy in human or otherworldly history has been solved with violence than any other solution?"<p>"Does that make it right?" The cloaked figure queried, finally looking up from the pool.<p>"Does that make it wrong either?" The armoured figure shot back.<p>"There are better ways to deal with this situation than violence."<p>"Of course, but you were always better at the subtle intrigues than I was." The armoured figure sat down upon its black throne.<p>"I thought you were going to deal with this in your own way."<p>"I feel it will be safer for us if I stay out of things for the time being."<p>"A wise choice, we would not wish to arouse the wrath of any more beings than we already do."<p>"In that case I leave this in your very capable hands." The armoured figure stated, waving a hand dismissively.<p>With their discussion complete the cloaked figure walked away from the room, leaving the armoured figure alone to watch the going on of everyone's favorite pigtailed martial artist and his fiancée.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Ummm, do you think they're going to let us down anytime soon?" Asked Daisuke as he stared down at the sleeping forms of the almost married Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo.<p>"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ," Hiroshi, having gotten bored with the proceedings after the woman had left chasing the fat guy who jumped them had fallen asleep.<p>"Why me?" Daisuke quietly, so as not to wake up either of the people sleeping on the floor, complained with tears running down his cheeks.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 18, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>This was a rather slow chapter I know, I intended more to happen than really did, but I felt that it would have taken away from the main part of this chapter if I had thrown in anything more.<p>Nodoka is back again, and ready to cut of Genma's head for him, but the question is does she also want Ranma's to go beside it. In chapter seventeen she was feeling remorse for how she treated him, does this mean she won't make him carry out the seppuku contract or will she make Ranma uphold the promise.<p>Ryoga's illusions are beginning to weaken or was it just momentary indecision on his part. Will his rage carry him onwards or will he finally listen to reason like Akane finally did. Of course Akane did have to die before she finally came to see she was fooling herself, will Ryoga's epiphany come at less of a price.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send an e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
