</div>One Last Chance ch.17<p>`<p>**** The End of Life****<p>`<p>`<p>`<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>`<p>`<p>`<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>`<p>` ` ` ` Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. Nabiki is now stuck in an engagement to Kuno. Ranma's curse was revealed to his mother. Akane refused to allow Nodoka to take Ranma's life threatening Nodoka with a tanto. Due to a series of events that occurred Nodoka decided to refrain from judging Ranma so soon, she left with a warning to Akane not to come between Nodoka and her duty or else. Ryoga after interrupting Ranma's sleep got punted through the ceiling and encountered Shampoo. ` ` ` ` `<p>"There is but one thing guaranteed to a person. Be a person the highest king or the lowest serf none can escape that which he is promised. To some he is a constant companion to others he is their worst enemy. Some pay homage to him while others live in constant fear. He is the greatest relief for those who suffer, the old, and the sick. He is death and he will have his due." ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima, Midnight ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ` ` ` `<br/>A cold silence settled on the streets of Nerima as a cloaked figure walked down the well-lit street. The lights seemed to fade a little and grow dark as the figure walked by. Dogs barked as the cloaked presence approached, but were wise enough to hide and cower whimpering in the shadows when the shadowy person got too close. Wives gripped their husbands more tightly, men woke up in a cold sweat, and children woke up screaming. A chill descended on the streets of Nerima for death stalked the streets that night.<p>Hiro Nagaske had been working late and chose to walk home to let the exercise bleed off some of the stress he felt from a hard day at the office. Stopping for a moment he dug into his pocket searching for a cigarette. With a frown he realized there wasn't one in the pocket. A quick search of his other pockets revealed a lone cigarette was all that was left of the last pack he had bought.<p>Hiro thought to himself with a slight touch of sarcasm.<p>Placing the cigarette into his mouth he brought out a lighter and lit it. Taking a deep drag of the cigarette he held it for a moment before releasing it in a slow steady stream. Briefly he reflected on what a nice night it was even if a slight bit chilly.<p>"Pardon me, but would you happen to know the way to the Tendo Dojo," a voice asked with the heaviness a funeral bell.<p>"Sorry, I'm not familiar with that place," Hiro lied, he knew where the Tendo Dojo was, most people who had lived in Nerima for a long time knew the respected Dojo and the equally respected man who lived there, but the directions were rather complex and he didn't feel like reciting them. Besides he was sure the Tendos wouldn't want a visitor at this time of night.<p>Hiro looked up to see a person standing not to far away from him, but he couldn't quite make out any of the features because of the darkness the figure was standing in. As a matter of fact the darkness seemed to surround the figure.<p>"Very well, thank you for your time," the same voice, heavy as a lead weight intoned.<p>The figure turned and began walking away, Hiro watched it go, unwilling to turn his head as if his life depended on not taking his eyes off this figure.<p>"You do know that smoking WILL kill you!" Hiro heard the dark voice as if the figure were still a few feet away from him.<p>Hiro had heard similar statements before from many different people, including his wife, but for some reason this stranger's words were less a warning and more of a promise.<p>"Oh yeah and how long will it take them to kill me, thirty, forty years?" Hiro responded with more bluster than he was feeling at the moment.<p>"Three days," the figure responded with a voice as optimistic as a funeral dirge.<p>The cigarette fell to the ground forgotten as Hiro Nagaske turned around and continued home at a faster pace than before.<p>The other figure continued into the darkness away from the man and in the general direction of the Tendo Dojo.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo Dojo, a few minutes later ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Ranma slept fitfully in his female form, not having bothered to get the hot water to reverse the curse to change back into his male form. Ranma rolled over in his futon and stared at the ceiling of the room he had gotten to know so well over the now nonexistent time, which he spent there. Unable to sleep properly he reminisced about how things were and how they should have been. The ceiling hadn't changed too much in the time he had stayed there from the way it was now. Although many of the boards had been replaced and repaired over his stay at the dojo it was still basically the same roof it had always been.<p>Of course the fat snoring panda that had been stuffed in the hole was a somewhat different than the boards which usually repaired the ceiling, but was nonetheless adequate for stemming most of the water which had tried to come in from the short shower. Luckily for the panda man, the rain had stopped after only a little while, sparing him from a completely wet night.<p>Genma's fur had mostly dried out leaving a rather unpleasant musk, which he managed to ignore having lived with it for about a month and never having been one to allow minor irritations such as a bad smell, a little pain, common morality, or the law to interrupt his business.<p>Ranma couldn't help but feel slightly uneasy as he lay staring at the ceiling, that little voice in his head which usually warned him of coming dangers was telling him something was coming. After all the trouble he had experienced Ranma was more than willing to trust his instincts when it came to danger.<p>Unconsciously he began fingering the special engagement ring he now wore on his hand, taking comfort from the warm reassuring feeling. After a while Ranma slipped into peaceful dreams, unaware of the shadowy figure watching him.<p>The shadowy figure slipped into the room through the now open window, causing Ranma to pull his blankets around himself a little tighter.<p>Silently the figure glides over to Ranma and extending a thin hand strokes the slumbering martial artist's cheek gently.<p>"Sleep well young one," a voice whispered with the quiet of a graveyard. Strangely enough the touch, which was akin to that of a warm deep grave, didn't disturb the slumbering martial artist's rest.<p>"Fair thee well little creature, I will be seeing you again shortly." And with less sound than a worm digging through the earth of a freshly dug grave all that was left in the room were a pair of cursed martial artists and their dreams.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Next morning, Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"So Ranma are you prepared for another day of fun and excitement at school?" queried Akane as they walked down a normal looking quiet Nerima street on the way to school.<p>"I'm not quite sure you could qualify school as fun and exciting after all we've been through."<p>"And now we get to go through all of those adventures again."<p>Ranma's response was less than enthusiastic and far from polite.<p>"What a mouth you have there, do you really kiss your fiancé with that mouth?"<p>"As often as we can get away with," came the response from a slightly blushing Ranma, eliciting a blush from Akane.<p>"RANMA PREPARE TO DIE," came a familiar voice from above the two.<p>A moment later Ryoga with his umbrella leading came down between Ranma and Akane, forcing the two to leap apart, throwing up a cloud of dust from the impact crater he put in the ground<p>"Ranma, for what you've done to me, I'll send you too hell," Ryoga growled standing up and menacingly pointing his umbrella at the target of his aggression.<p>As the dust cleared he could clearly see the mailbox of which he was threatening showing not the least amount of fear. After all it was an old mailbox, which had been in Nerima for many years and learned a good deal of courage over its life.<p>Ryoga blinked and looked around, growling in anger he yelled, "Curse you for running off again coward, Ranma I'll find you and get my revenge." Running off in pursuit of Ranma he dodged around the mailbox and ran straight through a wall.<p>Behind the crater Ranma and Akane stood watching the retreating figure of the fanged martial artist as he broke through the Nerima scenery heading away from Furinkan and his goal.<p>Never one to let things pass him by Ranma quickly responded to the situation.<p>"Bye Ryoga, see you in a few days." Ranma called after his rival's retreating form, waving goodbye.<p>"Well that was . . . brief," Akane deadpanned before realizing the time, "AARRGGH, we're going to be late." No sooner had Akane uttered her words then did she nearly dislocate Ranma's shoulder as she dragged him towards the school.<p>Ranma thought to himself as he watched the scenery fly by.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Furinkan High School a few minutes later ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>In the courtyard of Furinkan stood a lone figure standing stoically waiting for one man. The gentle breeze rustled his hair, as he stood alone, everything about him was almost the picture of a serious conflict coming. Behind him was Furinkan and before him were the gates from which his target would arrive. The dramatic picture was somewhat spoiled by the students surrounding him pointing and talking. He ignored them; knowing that the one he waited for would arrive soon and then he could settle his business and return home proud and with his honour restored. He was Ryu Kumon and his target was the martial artist known as Ranma Saotome.<p>A slight movement from his left caught Ryu's eye. An individual was appeared to be trying to sneak into the school, ducking behind other students and for the most part trying to keep low.<p>"You STOP!" Ryu commanded pointing at the figure. Instantly the other students parted from the intimidating stranger's sight to reveal a single student wearing a dear caught in the headlights look.<p>"Eep!" Was all the sound Daisuke was able to let out as a sudden clear space in the otherwise crowded courtyard appeared around him. Even Hiroshi had gotten away from him and was standing at the edge of the crowd looking at him.<p>Striding over to stand before Daisuke, Ryu wasn't too much larger than Daisuke height wise, but appeared to tower over the Furinkan student. The fact that Daisuke had recognized one of the two assailants from the night before and was even now cowering didn't help his situation.<p>"Y.," Daisuke managed to stammer out, staring fearfully into the evil eyes, those dreadful evil eyes.<p>"Where is Ranma Saotome, shouldn't he be here by now?"<p>"I.I...I...I...It's only .his third  . got lost," Daisuke managed to stammer out.<p>"Who is this noble individual who seeks the  Ranma Saotome?"<p>"Who wants to know," Ryu asked turning away from Daisuke, allowing the student to skitter off and change his underwear before school starts.<p>"Ahh I understand is it not the custom to give one's own name first. Verilly well, I am Tatewaki Kuno, also known as."<p>"Nice to meet you, I'm Ryu Kumon, now why did you ask," Ryu cut off Kuno before he could go into a long speech.<p>Schooling himself, barely, Kuno continued on trying to ignore the slight.<p>"Dost thou seek to deliver retribution to him, or art thee a dastardly ally of his."<p>Ryu looked the person calling himself Kuno over, ignoring the speech pattern, boken, and kendo garb he didn't seem that different from a normal person. He was obviously in excellent shape and had some skill from the way he moved, but that didn't tell how skilled he was just by looking at the Kendoist.<p>"I'm here for my own personal reasons, it is between Saotome and I, no one else." Ryu stated in a tone that brooked no arguments.<p>"Yet surely a warrior such as yourself is here to wrong some slight against you or your family caused by Saotome," Kuno argued anyway.<p>"I don't think I want to hear anything else you have to say."<p>Ryu turned away from the fuming Kuno and looked around for the little guy which helped him and Ryoga the other night, but wisely enough Daisuke was long gone and already inside the school.<p>Ryu turned to watch the front gates again, taking up his steadfast vigilance watching the students entering through the gates.<p>Most of the students realizing the show, for now, was over began heading inside before the bell rang. The supply of students streaming in began to lessen the closer it got to the actual bell until it was only one or two students still arriving at a time.<p>* Ding *<p>Two figures were left standing in the yard.<p>* Dong *<p>One was a strong imposing martial artist.<p>* Ding *<p>One was a fuming Kendoist moving up behind the martial artist, boken ready to strike.<p>* Dong *<p>Both stood still, straining they're ears to hear a voice that sounded slightly familiar.<p>* Ding *<p>"Come on Baka we're going to be late!"<p>* Dong *<p>Two pairs of eyes stared hard at the entrance, focusing on an approaching dust cloud.<p>* Ding *<p>The dust cloud flies into the school before heading into one of the classrooms.<p>* Dong *<p>"Phew, we made it," Akane's voices drifts out of an open classroom window on the third floor.<p>Out in the yard Ryu Kumon and Tatewaki Kuno lay a groan came from the two trampled bodies in the yard where Akane ran them down.<p>Ryu thought to himself right before he lost consciousness.<p>"I fight on," Kuno breathed out before he passed out.<p>"How the mighty have fallen," Nabiki's cold voice addresses the two unconscious boys.<p>"You'll owe me for this," the Ice Queen informed the fallen form of Ryu Kumon as she grabbed one of his arms.<p>"I'll put this on your tab," the middle Tendo informed her fiancée as she grabbed him by his leg.<p>A quick tug sent Ryu onto one of her shoulders. Not bothering to do the same to Kuno she began walking into school at a leisurely pace. It wasn't like she was worried with being late; she had a permanent excused tardiness for dragging Kuno to the nurse's after her sister was through with him. As a result she usually took her time enjoying the relative peace that was just for her and Kuno, and today Ryu, although Kuno was always unconscious or even more delusional than he usually was so she was the only one that enjoyed the peace.<p>The school doors swung shut after Nabiki passed through them with her human cargo, and another day at Furinkan High school began.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Just outside Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>A beautiful and bouncy figure surveyed the village where her prey was hiding herself this time. It was big, very big; in this 'Tokyo' her prey had lots more places to hide here than in other places the two of them had traveled in their game of cat and mouse. Fortunately for the Amazon huntress knew the name of the area in which her target was hiding.<p>Nerima<p>"Ranma, you I kill."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>* ACHOOO *<p>"Bless you!"<p>"Thanks Akane, I guess someone's talking about me," Ranma chuckled at the old folktale.<p>"Don't be silly Ranma, if you sneezed every time someone talked about you you'd never stop sneezing, especially not with the amount people talk about you."<p>"Yeah you're probably right, hey want to go get some ice cream?" Ranma asked, pointing at a nearby ice cream store.<p>"Isn't that the same ice cream shop where we first encountered Shampoo?"<p>"Nah we encountered her after our match with the Golden pair in the locker room," replied Ranma with a confused expression.<p>"Are you sure about that?"<p>"Not really, I can't seem to remember."<p>"Oh well, it doesn't matter, let's just get some ice cream." Akane ended the discussion, grabbing Ranma's hand and dragging him towards the shop.<p>Inside the shop they took a seat and waited until a waitress came by and took their order.<p>"I'll have a fruit parfait and some tea please," ordered Akane.<p>"Umm, can I have the same thing and a glass of ice water please," ordered Ranma with a slight flush on his face.<p>The waitress smiled and took their menus disappearing behind the counter to give their orders before moving on to another table.<p>The teenage couple sat in companionable silence at the table for a little while before a stray thought crossed Akane's mind.<p>"Why do you want the ice water Ranma?" Akane asked in a perfectly neutral tone of voice.<p>"Well, guys don't eat that kind of stuff so I'm going to change to a girl."<p>"I don't think so Baka," Akane's tone quickly became hostile, "I'm going to sit here with my male fiancée, guys eat 'that kind of stuff' too, and we're going to enjoy it like a normal couple."<p>Any thoughts of arguing quickly fled from Ranma's mind when he looked into her eyes and saw the possibility of mallet-sama forming in his fiancée's hands.<p>"Ok" Ranma said in a meek voice.<p>"Good Baka," Akane said cheerfully her expression brightening and the smile reappearing on her face.<p>"Whew." Ranma let out a sigh of relief.<p>A large crashing sound made the colour drain from Ranma's face as the couple looked over at one of the walls.<p>Where the waitress had tripped over a girl who had run in and grabbed the tray she was carrying, dumping everything on the tray onto the floor and creating the crashing sound.<p>"Phew," Ranma sighed in relief as he saw that it wasn't Shampoo come to get him.<p>"Trevor, Trevor you want to come home with little Azusa right?"<p>Akane just groaned and put her face in her hands. She definitely remembered Azusa and her partner and the trouble they caused. Now the little kleptomaniac was here trying to take a tray she had named Trevor.<p>Ranma groaned and hung his head. He was disappointed, but not for the same reason as Akane. Ranma was just watching all that beautiful and tasty ice cream going to waste on the floor.<p>"Charlotte, Charlotte, I found you," the overly cute little girl bubbled, making her way to the next object which had caught her fancy.<p>Akane felt a jerk on her arm and then something tugging on her ring finger.<p>With venom in her eyes she looked over seeing Azusa tugging on her finger, not just her finger, but her ring, and not just her ring, but her engagement ring. Flames sprung into Akane's eyes as she stared visual death into the shorter girl.<p>"Charlotte, Charlotte, Charlotte, let go of my Charlotte." Azusa asked teary eyed to the mean girl who wouldn't let go of the absolutely adorable item.<p>"Let. Go. Of. My. Engagement. Ring. Or. Else." Ranma shied back as far as the booth's seats would let him, pushing into and almost through the seat's back to escape, even though that glare wasn't directed at him.<p>Many of the people watching the scene felt a chill go down their spines at the sheer amount of venom the girl had been able to fit into her arctic voice. Unfortunately for her Azusa was watching what looked like a flame dancing inside the Sapphire and missed the very words Akane said.<p>Grabbing the smaller girls arms Akane picked her up and threw her into a wall, leaving cracks around her indention. Unseen by all the red flame in the Emerald of Ranma's ring grew slightly brighter.<p>"Please excuse Azusa, sometimes she items which are cute and wants to take them home with her." A tall man who had walked up behind Azusa before she went on her brief flight said.<p>"Isn't that illegal," an individual sitting in another booth asked, but was ignored by the four main players of the scene.<p>"Allow me to make it up to you, I am Mikado Sanzenin," Mikado said leaning over to give Akane a kiss on her lips. Even though she knew it was coming, Akane was shocked he actually would dare to try and kiss her even though she was wearing a ring.<p>Mikado leaned down, his face getting closer to hers, Akane realized she had hesitated too long and for some reason wasn't going to be able to escape.<p>Mikado's face came lower and suddenly went past her as he doubled over from Ranma's fist colliding with his stomach.<p>"How dare you strike me when I was attempting to bestow my favor on this girl." Mikado berated Ranma looking down on the interloper who had disrupted his kissing technique no girl could refuse or escape even if they tried.<p>"How dare you try to kiss my fiancée," Ranma shot back.<p>"How dare you how dare my how dare you." Mikado quipped.<p>"How dare you how dare my how dare you how daring your how dare you." Ranma returned.<p>As Ranma and Mikado verbally sparred, the rest of the ice cream shop had adjusted themselves at their seats so they could have a good view of the impromptu floorshow. This was also one of the reasons why the owner hadn't stepped in yet and kicked them out as they were drawing him quite the paying crowd.<p>The waitress was moving around again and taking orders from the assembled people who took a moment out of their lives to catch a bite to eat and relax.<p>"...How daring my how dare which how dared your how dare daring my how dare daring..."<p>Azusa began peeling herself out of the wall while trying to catch all the Francois flying round her head.<p>Akane sighed in relief as Mikado's focus on her was diverted from her and to Ranma. Not having noticed the slightly brighter gleam in the sapphire of her ring at first when Ranma hit Mikado and growing slightly when he began arguing with the skater.<p>She regained full control of herself at about the same time as all the Francois disappeared from around Azusa's head.<p>"GIVE ME MY CHARLOTTE, I WANT MY CHARLOTTE," She yelled running towards Akane.<p>"I challenge you," Ranma and Mikado stopped arguing to look at the two girls.<p>"I challenge you too a match, if you loose you must return all the things you've stolen from people." Ranma was shocked to see that it was Akane who made the challenge.<p>"Fine, but if you loose you give Charlotte back to Azusa."<p>"Fine."<p>"I challenge you to a match as well." Everyone turned to the latest challenger, people sitting at the edge of their seats, eating their ice cream, and watching the unfolding drama.<p>"I challenge you Mikado Sanzenin to a match." Ranma's words echoed around the shop as people held their breath, hanging onto every word said, "For trying to kiss my fiancée."<p>"We accept your offer, we will meet you at the Kolhotz skating ring in one week to have our match." Mikado stated as Azusa moved over to stand beside him while making faces at Akane.<p>"Don't you two realize that those two are the Golden Pair of Kolhotz high school, martial arts figure skating champions?" A random individual in the crowd shouted out, spurring a low mumble of recognition from the crowd and causing the two subjects to strike a team pose.<p>"No, the match will be in the Furinkan High's gymnasium in one week." Ranma declared.<p>"What?" Azusa and Mikado asked at once.<p>"We challenged you to a match not the other way around so we get to set the terms, and this is not going to be a martial arts figure skating match, it is going to be a real martial arts match." Akane stated as the two walked past the gawking pair and out the door leaving the golden pair to stare at their backs.<p>"Hey, this is the bill for your friends." The owner called out throwing the piece of paper right into Mikado's hands amazingly well considering how lacking in aerodynamics paper is.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A house Juban ward, Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>A woman sat alone in her room crying. Cursing at herself, crying at fate, cursing the contract, and crying at how cruel life could be.<p>Yesterday she had met her son, a meeting of which she had been hoping and longing for. It had happened, the meeting she had wanted for more than a decade happened and she had ruined it. Ruined it because of words told to her by strangers.<p>She had hoped for a strong manly son, but after the words of two strangers, well actually one the other didn't really talk much, she had come expecting a craven beast or a monster.<p>Too late she realized he wasn't and then, the curse had happened. She hadn't known how to react to her manly son turning into a girl and had reacted badly, forcing her  to go fetch his tanto. If it hadn't been for her son's fiancée she would have in her foolishness made her only child commit seppuku.<p>As it was she had threatened her son's fiancée, her own daughter-in-law, what had she been thinking? The two obviously cared for each other greatly and Akane had even risked her life to defend her fiancée. Nodoka could she was very skilled in the art and would be a fine martial artist, Nodoka couldn't even feel angry at the girl for being so disrespectful to her either. Nodoka looked at the day and realized exactly what had happened.<p>A moment of anger and fear had probably ruined her relationship with her son, Nodoka could only pray that there was some way for her to make amends. Nodoka fingered her own tanto as she stared at the Saotome family blade, she would do anything to make amends, even if the price she had to pay was her very life.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere Else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA."<p>"No, I just don't think insane laughter suits you, low evil laughter and chuckling is much more your style."<p>"Really?"<p>"Yes, low maniacal laughter works a lot better with the black armour than high maniacal laughter does. You sound more like Cyric or Kodachi when you laugh like that."<p>The Armoured figure practically shuddered, "Don't compare me to either of those two."<p>"Verily well, but you have to admit a laugh, while aesthetically intimidating and aurally appreciated, isn't as important in the grand scheme of things as an intimidating presence such as how you're always clad in that black armour and I'm always hidden by my cloak."<p>"What about laughing for pleasure rather than intimidation."<p>"I guess that's okay sometimes, but it also probably depends on whether you're considered to be good or evil."<p>"Even you have to take some pleasure in the situation at the very least." The Armoured figure chuckled.<p>"While I will admit seeing the looks on the faces of those two when they were challenged was hilarious."<p>"Yes, it was deliciously surprising."<p>"Well we didn't expect the godslayer and his mate to challenge the golden pair either, we expected them to wait for the challenge to come like last time," the cloaked figure remarked.<p>"The godslayer beat them on the ice, I'm sure he can beat them off the ice with ease."<p>"Indubitably," remarked the cloaked figure.<p>"I can't wait to see this match happen even if the result of it are completely predictable," The Armoured figure uttered what might have been a grin on it's face, if immovable masks could smile.<p>"What about the rings, I thought I saw the one on the Godslayer's hand glow brighter."<p>"I didn't see it, are you sure?"<p>"Definitely."<p>The armoured figure's brow furrowed in thought, or at least as much as a mask could furrow.<p>"Hold on, I've been recording it so we could go back and review." The armoured figure reached down, picking up what looked like a TV remote, if TV remotes were made out of bones and skin.<p>"I'll just rewind it a few minutes and we'll see."<p>The armoured figure pushes play and both lean forward to watch the screen.<p>After a moment of static a picture appears.<p>* Wherever monsters rampage I'm there to take them down, wherever treasure glistens I'm there to claim it. *<p>A sweat drop grows on the back of the cloaked figure's hood.<p>"You recorded Slayers?" The cloaked figure carefully asked.<p>"Cursed Hephestus, I should have listened to his advice and just bought one from circuit city rather than have one made for me by Gond. I'll never figure out the settings on this thing." The Armoured figure groused in response.<p>Both figures pause for a moment, glancing at each other before the cloaked figure breaks the silence.<p>"So, Cable or Satellite?"<p>"Cable, you wouldn't believe how bad the satellite reception is here."<p>"I can imagine."<p>Both figures laugh.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 17, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>I apologize for not updating in so long, but my summer was rather hectic and I completely lost all inspiration and had no idea what to write, but now that I'm back at school and my muse has returned to me I feel a second wind coming. So all I have to say is 'don't expect too much from me over the holidays'.<p>I'd like to thank Mr. Guyman for his oh so eloquent review, it really helped me get back into the swing of things and start working on the chapter. No hard feelings I hope as I enjoy all reviews, even the ones threatening my life (although I would like those kept to a minimum if possible).<p>So once again to all my loyal and not so loyal readers I apologize for making you wait four months for this chapter, I guarantee the next ones aren't going to take that long.<p>Well Shampoo is nearing Nerima, the golden pair have stepped, and Nodoka is in a quandary. A lot can happen in one chapter, or nothing at all. MWAHAHAHAHA.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send an e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
