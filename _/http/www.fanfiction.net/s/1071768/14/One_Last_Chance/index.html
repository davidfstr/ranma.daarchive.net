</div>One Last Chance ch.14<p>**** Allies, Enemies or Both ****<br/>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<br/>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<br/>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter Ranma reveals how he switched the marriage contracts, engaging Nabiki to Kuno rather than Akane being engaged to the Kendoist. Nabiki is now stuck in an engagement to Kuno. Ryoga and his companion have finally made it to Tokyo, unfortunately they ran into Nodoka Saotome upon their arrival and Ryoga portrayed Ranma as a coward and unmanly. Nodoka left to find Ranma and Genma. Ryoga and his companion arrived at Furinkan to learn that they missed Ranma. After roughing up Daisuke, the two left and decided to come back the next day. Daisuke phoned Akane and told her that a couple of martial artists were looking for Ranma. Now we return to see how our hero handles this latest set of challenges placed before him.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo House, Morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>We join the Tendo household on a nice bright sunny Nerima morning.<p>"AHHHHHHH."<p>* CRACK *<p>"Oh god NOOOOOOOOOOOOO."<p>* SLAM *<p>"Mercy, Mercy PLEASE."<p>* Whimper *<p>"You'll . . . pay . . . for . . . this . . . boyAAAAAYYYYYYYY."<p>* SPLASH *<p>"Growwf GROWF GRRRRR."<p>* THUMP *<p>* CLANG *<p>"(Censored Panda talk)"<p>* CRACK SLAM THUMP SCREAM WHIMPER *<p>Ranma walks in from outside, whistling cheerfully and dusting off his hands, and sits down at the breakfast table next to Akane and joins the Tendo family in their meal. He ignored the whimper coming from the Panda in the yard.<p>Akane greeted Ranma cheerfully and then resumed her eating. She really didn't like the moaning panda much anyway for all the things he did to his son over the training trip that the two went on so she wasn't very likely to care about the panda's plight and was actually enjoying it to an extent.<p>Nabiki was still disoriented and half-asleep as such and since she wasn't much of a morning person as it was. Neither did she think much of the Saotome patriarch/panda anyway, nor was she much of a sympathetic person to other people's plights. As such, she just ignored<p>"Oh my, I guess Mr. Saotome will want a different breakfast now," Kasumi blankly stated, and using her skills in the anything goes school of homemaking, pulled out a plate of bamboo and placed it on the table.<p>Soun stared at the sight of his oldest and best friend laying on the ground whimpering. The overly emotional man was torn between two different courses of action. On one hand there was responding to Genma and on the other hand responding to Ranma. If that wasn't a difficult enough decision, he had to break those up into two different choices of actions which he wasn't sure which to do.<p>If he responded to Genma, he wanted to bemoan both the rough treatment of his friend and his friend's suffering. Soun was sure that he'd cry over the harsh treatment of his friend should he choose this path.<p>Then there was responding to Genma a different way. He felt like going out and slapping his friend on the back and congratulating him on how well he had raised and trained his son. Soun was positive that should he congratulate his friend, he'd break out in tears of joy at his friend's teaching skills.<p>Of course there was Ranma to respond too. Soun knew it was only proper to berate Ranma for being so disrespectful to his father and throwing him all around the roof, yard, walls, pond, dojo, street, and block before depositing him outside the doors. Soun knew he would cry in shame at how a boy could mistreat his own loving father so.<p>Finally there was responding to Ranma in a different manner. The Tendo patriarch was only too impressed by the ability the boy displayed, after all Genma was one of the best martial artists Soun knew and Ranma had just thrown the Saotome School's master around the roof, yard, walls, pond, dojo, street, and block as if it were an easy task before depositing the dripping panda in a broken heap outside the doors. Soun suspected he'd cry in pride over his son-in-law's mastery of the school of anything goes martial arts.<p>Soun's higher functions were unable to deal with a choice of such great magnitude. This error caused the Soun Operating System, an unreliable and even more error prone system than any unbugged version of Windows, which has been aptly dubbed the SOS, to move into standby until the unrecognizable error was dealt with in a manner, which would allow the SOS to restart. Until such time the SOS shut down all higher functions and placed his body so only the autonomic systems were running.<p>To sum up the previous statements, Soun sat their eating breakfast and seemingly more oblivious than even Kasumi on her foggiest day.<p>"Come on Ranma, let's go to school," Akane said, putting her bowl down and running for the kitchen to grab her bento.<p>"Sure Akane, right behind ya," Ranma replied, not really having much of a choice as Akane was pulling him along by his pigtailed.<p>The two grabbed their bentos and headed out the door for another day of school.<p>"Oh my, I wonder why Ranma and Akane wanted to leave so early today. Do you know Nabiki," Kasumi asked, looking back from where the dust the two had kicked up was dispersing to where her younger sister sat.<p>Only to see that her younger sister wasn't currently occupying the spot where she usually sat.<p>"Bye sis, I need to get to school," Nabiki yelled as she shot past her older sister, racing to get to school.<p>"Nabiki, you forgot your lunch," Kasumi called after the rapidly retreating form of the middle Tendo sister, "oh my, I hope she doesn't go hungry," Kasumi said as the dust kicked up by Nabiki settled, "I'm sure someone at school will share with her, maybe even her fiancée."<p>Kasumi smiled vacantly, her good cheer justified for now.<p>A quiet whimpering came from the yard.<p>"Oh my, I'd better heat some hot water for Mr. Saotome."<p>Looking at the twisted and mangled panda as she passed, a thought came to her.<p>"Maybe I should call Dr. Tofu to have a look at Mr. Saotome, I'm sure the doctor will take care of him."<p>The panda merely whimpered.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"Do you think Ryoga will be there before school," Akane asked as the two ran along the fence, heading for grounds of Furinkan High.<p>"I have a feeling he might be there, but if he has someone helping him, there's no way for us to know when he'll arrive," came Ranma's reply, confusing Akane.<p>"What do you mean Ranma, if Ryoga regularly gets lost on his own wouldn't someone who was helping him find his way mean he'll get to where he's going faster than if he was going just by himself."<p>"That's usually true, but even normal people get lost regularly and Ryoga's bad sense of direction has a way of distorting things, how else would he get lost so much."<p>Akane shot Ranma a disbelieving look.<p>"Ranma, just because Ryoga has a bad sense of direction, doesn't mean that everyone around him will get lost, that's hard to believe."<p>"It's not just that Akane, people can get lost too, if this guy hasn't been to Nerima before he might get lost and end up somewhere else."<p>"Ranma, this fight is very important to Ryoga, and I imagine it's important to whoever is traveling with Ryoga as well, I don't think they'll get lost."<p>"Yeah I guess you're right Akane."<p>The two turned and entered the gates of Furinkan High School.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere in Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"Are we lost?"<p>"You of all people have no right to ask that question," Ryoga's companion spitefully replied before looking around.<p>"Well, do you know where we are?"<p>"We're still in Nerima, I know that much."<p>"And just why are you so sure, with you leading we could be anywhere," Ryoga smugly stated, it felt good to know that for once it wasn't his fault that he was lost.<p>In response his companion just pointed to a sign a few meters from them.<p>Ryoga glanced at the sign, "It's a newspaper sign, so what?"<p>"Read the letters idiot."<p>"Nerima Local Times," Ryoga grumbled to himself, "but you still got us lost."<p>"Ok, so that's what, one for me, eighty-seven for you?"<p>"SHUT UP," Ryoga yelled.<p>"HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO."<p>"Umm why are you laughing," Ryoga asked his companion, as soon as he heard that voice, shivers went up his spine.<p>"You mean that wasn't you laughing," Ryoga's companion asked, pushing down the instinct that said, 'run and don't look back'.<p>Ryoga shook his head.<p>"Well peasants, what are you doing, intruding upon your betters," a high- pitched feminine voice asked.<p>The two boys began looking around for the first time actually taking note of where they stood. Around them were a lot of girls all wearing what appeared to be catholic schoolgirl uniforms. They also appeared to be standing in the yard of quite a fancy school. Standing a little ways away from them was a long black haired girl wearing one of the uniforms she looked quite impatient.<p>"Well peasants, are you going to answer me," the girl asked again, she appeared to be getting irritated by their lack of an answer.<p>"Are you talking to us," Ryoga asked, causing his companion to groan at the sheer stupidity of Ryoga's statement.<p>"Who else is she talking to, she's standing in front of us, looking right at us, and there's no one within four meters of us, who else could she possibly be talking too?"<p>"Shut up, or else I'm going to . . ."<p>"BOTH OF YOU PEASANTS BE QUIET," the girl yelled.<p>Both boys turned to look at the yelling girl. Both could have sworn they saw steam coming out of her ears. Visibly calming herself the girl spoke again.<p>"Now peasants, what are you doing here?"<p>"Where is here," Ryoga asked<p>Wow, I didn't think he could say that any other way than 'where the hell am I', I'm impressed thought Ryoga's companion.<p>"You are at St. Heberke's school for girls, I am Kodachi Kuno, the black rose of St. Heberke and star of the rhythmic gymnastics marital arts world. HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO."<p>Both boys cringed at her laugh.<p>"We're looking for Furinkan High School."<p>"HOHOHOHOHOHO, so you're looking for my brother are you, well then he's that way," Kodachi pointed her club out in a direction behind the two boys who both blinked. Where did she get that club?<p>"Umm thanks," both boys replied as they took off. Neither was sure what was more important, getting to Furinkan and finding Ranma or getting away from the crazy girl who was laughing insanely behind them.<p>Taking to the roofs the two began roof hoping in the direction Kodachi had pointed.<p>"Soon Ranma, soon I'll pay you back for making my life hell," Ryoga muttered.<p>His companion who had gotten used to Ryoga's ranting a long time ago just ignored Ryoga and concentrated on getting to Furinkan, there was no way he was going to let the lost boy make fun of him for getting lost again.<p>Kodachi stood watching the two bounce off.<p>Hmm, both of them are quite attractive, and those fangs make that one boy look quite dangerous. Maybe I should go visit my brother today.<p>Another thought came to Kodachi.<p>"After all, I do have a match with the Furinkan rhythmic gymnastic team anyway, it would be appropriate if I went and greeted them in my special manner to the competition. HOHOHOHOHO Yes that would be appropriate," Kodachi began laughing while the rest of the school just walked past her, giving her a wide berth.<p>Students at St. Heberke had learnt long ago not to bother Kodachi, as it tended to prove hazardous to one's continued health. As a matter of fact teachers had also learnt not to Kodachi as it proved not only to be hazardous to one's health, but also their career.<p>Kodachi looked over to another student on the gymnastics team, as she happened to be trying to pass, catching her wrist with a ribbon that had taken the place of the club she was carrying.<p>"You, tell my teachers that I will be back soon, I must go greet our competition in an appropriate manner."<p>"Yes Captain Kodachi," the girl managed to get out, thanking the gods that that was the only thing Kodachi wanted from her.<p>"HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO," Kodachi took off bouncing over the roofs ribbon twirling behind her, as she headed for her brother's school.<p>Her classmates and teachers just watched her go, silently thanking the kami for their brief reprieve from Kodachi's antics for at least one day.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Furinkan High School, Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"Well they haven't arrived yet," Ranma stated as he walked besides Akane out of their classroom, heading outside to eat lunch.<p>"No, it's quite strange, I would have expected them to be here this morning, but they'll be here by tomorrow, I'm sure," Akane, walking beside Ranma, replied as they neared the doors to the outside.<p>"I hope so."<p>"You actually sound like you want Ryoga to get here," Akane questioned.<p>"Yeah, well he always was a good fight, and when he wasn't trying to punish me for some slight against you or him, he was actually a pretty good guy that helped us out of quite a few tough scrapes."<p>"And slept in my bed."<p>Ranma chose to keep his mouth shut to avoid the hammer he knew Akane could summon in an instant to crush him with. Forcibly keeping down the Saotome open mouth insert foot technique Ranma just kept walking towards the door.<p>The two stepped outside and began walking over to the spot they usually sat out to eat lunch.<p>The two sat down with their backs against the tree, side by side, and opened up their bentos.<p>"So Ranma, you going to do better in school this time around," Akane asked, poking Ranma with her chopsticks.<p>"Sure, I mean I've already been through all this once, so it'll be a lot easier," Ranma smugly replied.<p>"Only if you can keep your eyes open and your head up, baka," Akane said, lovingly wrapping her fiancée on his head.<p>"Geez, Ok Akane, I will, just don't hurt me ok," Ranma laughing said.<p>Akane laughed with him.<p>Ranma reached over to put his arm around Akane's shoulder, but instead pushed her aside roughly.<p>"Hey what was that for," Akane yelled, looking back to where Ranma sat.<p>Only to find herself face to handle with an umbrella, which was firmly embedded in, and sticking out of the tree where they had been sitting up till a few seconds ago.<p>"Still good at running away I see Ranma," Ryoga stated, walking across the courtyard towards where the pair was now sprawled out.<p>"Ryoga," Ranma growled.<p>Akane blinked, Ranma had planned on greeting Ryoga and trying to be friendly, that was definitely an unfriendly voice.<p>"Glad you remember the man who's life you ruined, Ranma because of you I've seen hell and I've come for vengeance," Ryoga growled back.<p>Ranma stood up, reaching over and pulling Ryoga's umbrella out of the tree as easily as Ryoga had thrown it.<p>Ranma glowered at Ryoga as he stood up, a faint battle aura forming around him.<p>"Just tell me one thing Ranma, why did you run out from our man to man duel?"<p>Ranma opened his mouth to speak when Akane was up, past the pigtailed martial artist, and in Ryoga's face.<p>"What do you mean he ran out, you are the one who ran away, you were three days late for the duel," Akane yelled into Ryoga's face, causing him to take a few steps backwards due to the sheer force of her words.<p>Ryoga was stunned that someone would take Ranma's side of the argument; after all it was Ranma who ran away wasn't it?<p>"When I showed up on the fourth day, Ranma had run away like a coward."<p>"That means you forfeited the duel by not showing up on time for it," Ranma said, gripping the handle of the umbrella so tightly his knuckles turned white.<p>"Do you think I was out for a casual stroll, you have no idea what I went through to get there?"<p>"Ryoga, it was the yard behind your house."<p>"SHUT UP RANMA, I told you, I got lost, you know I have trouble getting to places, if you knew I was going to get lost why didn't you lead me there?"<p>Ranma didn't look quite as angry as he did before; he walked up beside Akane to face Ryoga, still carrying the weighted umbrella over his shoulder. If Ryoga noticed that Ranma was carrying his heavy umbrella over one shoulder and with one hand like it was nothing, he didn't show it.<p>"Ryoga, how would it look if the person you were supposed to fight lead you to the place where we were meant to duel," Ranma asked, genuinely interested in what the lost boy had to say.<p>"Well I guess that makes sense, I mean- . . ." Ryoga suddenly realized that he was agreeing with his enemy and the cause of all his suffering and yelled back, "THAT DOESN'T MATTER, you should have waited another day."<p>Ryoga's constant blaming of Ranma over the two years they'd known him, even though she'd only just encountered him a few minutes ago, had begun to really irritate Akane especially since Ryoga's blaming of Ranma reminded her of all the time she had blamed Ranma for things that weren't his fault. Akane decided to cut in before Ryoga could continue; she hoped her calm touch could keep things from getting worse.<p>"STOP BLAMING RANMA, if you knew you were going to be four days late, why didn't you leave a day or four earlier, or why didn't you schedule the fight later. You forfeited the duel by not showing up on time," Akane yelled at Ryoga, causing him to step back again. Maybe an irritated Akane isn't the best thing to calm down an aggravated Ryoga, as a matter of fact; a rampaging boar would be more effective at calming Ryoga down.<p>Ryoga's mind was currently trying to grasp the concept that something wasn't Ranma's fault and that there was more to Ranma leaving all those years ago. The Ryoga OS chose this moment to perform a stack dump and go along with firmly established base algorithms while the CPU rebooted.<p>"Ranma, for what you've done to me, I will have my vengeance," Ryoga lunged forwards towards Ranma, fist cocked to strike at his face.<p>Only to have Akane step in front of his fist, uncaring of the new obstacle Ryoga kept going at his target, a red haze covering his vision, blocking out everything, but his target, which just happened to be Ranma.<p>Akane saw the Ryoga barreling towards her, seemingly oblivious to her presence and dropped into a defensive stance waiting for him to get close enough.<p>Ryoga still oblivious to the possible threat, continued his charge towards Ranma, ready to shoulder block the obstacle between him and his target out of the way.<p>Akane saw the shoulder block coming in Ryoga's bull rush. He was almost in range, almost, almost, just another half second.<p>And then Akane was sprawled on the ground where Ranma pushed her. Looking up she saw Ranma had thrust Ryoga's umbrella out at Ryoga and Ryoga had taken it on his shoulder, the compression had splintered the umbrella.<p>"What suffering have I caused you Ryoga," Ranma asked between clenched teeth.<p>"How dare you ask that question Ranma, all you need to know is that because of you I've seen hell? Ranma prepare to die," Ryoga replied, pulling back his fist to deliver a blow capable of breaking rock.<p>"DIE!" Ryoga yelled bringing his fist forwards, or at the very least attempting to, only to discover his wrist was being held in someone's hand, amazingly the person was able to hold him back.<p>"WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST RANMA THIS TIME," Akane yelled, making Ryoga step back and turn so he was standing beside Ranma.<p>"AND YOU RANMA, HOW DARE YOU PUSH ME OUT OF THE WAY, I could have taken him, I'm a marital artist too," Akane yelled at Ranma this time.<p>The enraged blue-black haired girl began yelling at the two martial artists, baking them both back into the tree where they couldn't back up any further from the enraged female martial artist.<p>"Ummm, who are you," Ryoga meekly asked, he had never been very good at dealing with girls, and now that he wasn't focusing on Ranma, but dealing with this girl, Ryoga's brain began stumbling around.<p>"I'm Akane Tendo, heir to the Tendo Dojo," Akane hotly replied, annoyed at Ryoga for having ignored her earlier and angry at Ranma for having treated her like she was a fragile little girl and not the martial artist she was.<p>"Why are you protecting Ranma," Ryoga asked, brining a scowl to Ranma's face.<p>"I'll tell you why if you'll tell me why you're trying to kill him," Akane tersely stated.<p>Ryoga for the first time since seeing Ranma became aware of just where he was, looking around he saw a very large crowd of students gathered around the three of them, watching eagerly.<p>I can't reveal my dark secret here, but this girl has made it so I can't just attack Ranma without a reason.<p>Ryoga looked around and saw that Furinkan's wall was pretty close to where he was standing. Ryoga made a run for the wall, shouting over his shoulder, "Ranma, your punishment has been delayed for now, enjoy the brief stay of execution, I'll be back."<p>With his statement he ran out of sight, into the school building. Several loud crashes were heard as he ran through a few walls and out the other side of Furinkan.<p>"Well that was pointless," Ranma muttered, watching Ryoga disappear in a cloud of dust.<p>"RRRRAAAANNNNNMMMMAAAA," Akane growled, sticking her face into his field of vision, but only a few inches away.<p>The flickering blue aura surrounding his fiancée was the first thing that tipped Ranma off that Akane might not be too pleased with him at the moment.<p>"Ummm, yes Akane," Ranma answered in a tone equally as meek as the one Ryoga had used earlier when he had to face Akane's wrath.<p>"Why did you push me out of the way just a moment ago?"<p>Akane's fingers began to twitch and Ranma could see the vague outline of a mallet flickering in the air.<p>"I didn't want you getting hurt Akane."<p>"So you think I'm some china doll that would break, I can take care of myself, I'm a martial artist too."<p>"Not against Ryoga you wouldn't, even if you're more skilled in the art than him, he's still a walking tank even without the breaking point training, and I'm not even sure if you're more skilled than him yet," Ranma replied with more force, given strength by the conviction of his words.<p>Akane however wasn't willing to let her fiancée off so easily, "When will I be good enough Ranma, will you always fight my battles for me, how am I meant to get better if you don't let me fight for myself?"<p>"Fine Akane, if that's the way you feel about it, as long as the next person to attack us isn't Ryoga, I'll let you deal with them, ok?"<p>"Promise Ranma," Akane asked, she knew this probably was the most she could get out of him, but just the chance to prove herself to Ranma was something Akane really wanted.<p>"Sure," Ranma replied, and then almost immediately kicked himself, he had just given his word of honour that he would let Akane take the next person who came along, what if the next person was someone like Herb or Saffron, Akane wouldn't stand a chance, "but if things are going bad and your in trouble I will step in," Ranma hastily added.<p>Akane's mood went from delighted as soon as Ranma consented, to irritated when he amended his promise.<p>"No Ranma, next one is mine and mine alone, I don't want you watching over my shoulder for the rest of my life. PLEASE, just let me do this," Akane pleaded, doing a full puppy-dog eyes attack coupled with a slight gathering of moisture and pouty lips.<p>Ranma's iron resolve, coupled with his mastered soul of Ice technique, and many years of training lasted a full half-second against his fiancée's devastating assault.<p>"Ok," he said, barely managing to keep himself from reaching out and comforting Akane.<p>"Thank you," Akane's appearance did another about face as the moisture disappeared, the pout became a heart-warming smile that could melt ice, and her eyes shone with joy.<p>"No problem," Ranma replied, distracted by her smile and in a semi-stupor, as he still hadn't recovered from her devastating series of emotional assaults.<p>"Let's eat lunch quickly before the period ends," Akane suggested, still beaming brightly.<p>"Ok," Ranma answered, still a little distracted as Akane led him back over to the tree they were sitting against.<p>The two of them sat down and continued their lunch, pointedly ignoring damage to the tree and the gawking crowd that was still around them.<p>From his place on the roof Ryoga's companion had watched the entire scene unfold.<p>"Hmm, Ranma Saotome, you're pretty good, maybe even better than me. I'll have to think about how to approach this situation if I am going to get what I want. Too bad I passed up the chance with his mother, I probably could have passed myself off as Ranma to her, after all, I am pretty manly myself."<p>Ryoga's companion sat on the roof, watching as the two finished their lunch and went inside.<p>"No point in just running in like Ryoga did and tearing up the place. I think I'll watch Saotome for a while," Ryoga's companion smirked, "then I'll go running in and tear up the place."<p>He turned around to see that strange girl Ryoga and he had run into earlier that day when they were looking for Furinkan and ended up at that St. Heberke School. She appeared to be using the distraction Ryoga's arrival and the subsequent conflict to be sneaking into the gym.<p>Sneaking being a very loose term if a person could consider a tall longhaired girl dressed in a very nice formfitting leotard bouncing around while twirling a ribbon behind her. He could practically hear her maniacal laughter even though she wasn't laughing right now.<p>He briefly considered going to check out the situation, but decided against it, it wasn't any of his business what went on around here, and all he was here for was Ranma.<p>With that thought in mind and as the tardy bell rang Ryoga's ex-companion left.<p>I could probably pull of a pretty good impression of Ranma off if I had too. Too bad I didn't think of that earlier, I could probably have passed myself off as Ranma to his mother, which would probably make things easier. Oh well, no use crying over wasted chances.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Osaka, Japan ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Where the hell am I now," Ryoga screamed.<p>This was just great, not only had the streets moved on him again making him lose his way, again, but also his traveling companion had wandered off and gotten himself lost.<p>"Geez, how does he expect to find Ranma without me to guide him," Ryoga asked no one in particular.<p>Ryoga was getting frustrated, it was getting dark and he was tired, Ranma and that girl Akane's words had been haunting him all day.<p>Was it possible that it wasn't Ranma's fault, but it had to be Ranma's fault he left early, no not early, Ryoga had been late, and Ryoga had to chase the pony-tailed martial artist to finish their duel.<p>He knew he shouldn't blame Ranma for the curse he had received; he hadn't even seen Ranma from the time shortly before the duel and today. If anyone was to blame, it was that red-haired girl wearing the gi and her panda. She was the one who pushed him into that cursed spring, but that was the only time Ryoga had ever seen her, he hadn't heard a word about her again except when the spring guide's daughter told him that she and her panda, he hated that panda for trying to cook him, had taken off with the spring guide heading towards some Amazon village. It seems that Ranma and his father had gone with them, so Ryoga had decided to follow. He had found an Amazon village, but the headhunters there had chased him through the forest, it had been a nightmare with the sheer amount of water that was under those huge trees. He had been more than happy enough when he had stumbled out of that jungle and into the nice dry sandy desert.<p>He knew Ranma was a coward, running from Ryoga like he had, but Ryoga couldn't blame him for that. Running from his just wrath was the only smart thing to do.<p>"Ranma, I'll be there soon and then we can settle this," Ryoga said, punching a tree off to his side.<p>A female scream sounded as the tree fell. Ryoga looked over, but didn't see anything besides a girl bathing in a nearby stream.<p>Wait, girl, stream, bathing, and girl is naked when bathing, I'm in trouble.<p>Ryoga grabbed his nose to keep a stream of blood from escaping and making him bleed to death.<p>The girl began growling and stood up, forcing Ryoga to apply more pressure to his nose as the quantity of blood trying to escape increased drastically. The girl pointed her sword at Ryoga.<p>Wait, she's naked, where did she get that sword from? Ryoga idly thought while backing up, he also mentally noted that somehow her she was a natural lavender.<p>The lavender haired girl growled out, "You I kill."<p>Ryoga wasn't quite sure what to do, so he just ran away, not wanting to hit a girl, and not wanting to die from blood loss.<p>I wonder if this is Ranma's fault too? Ryoga wondered, albeit not particularly angry for some reason.<p>Ryoga ran through some bushes with the girl gaining on him, as she wasn't encumbered by a backpack or clothes for that matter.<p>Shampoo burst through the bushes looking for the pervert who was peeping on her. She listened to the sounds of the forest while carefully looking around the surrounding flora, but couldn't see nor hear where the pervert might have gone.<p>Looking down, she saw that his tracks seemed to just disappear into thin air.<p>Shampoo walked back to finish her bath, muttering about perverted nature spirits.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Streets of Nerima, After School ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"You want to do anything special tonight Ranma," Akane asked, walking in front of the pigtailed martial artist on the fence.<p>"Not really, I just want to get home, train, eat dinner, and get some sleep. We'll be getting Ryoga's challenge in a day or two, until then things should be pretty quiet."<p>"Don't forget your homework, I'm not going to marry some illiterate baka."<p>"Yes dear."<p>Nabiki walking on the ground by the fence fought to suppress a laugh, Ranma sounded just like her father did whenever mother wanted him to do something he wasn't looking forwards to.<p>"You sound occupied Ranma-kun, is something wrong," Nabiki asked.<p>"Yeah, I'm wondering who the person with Ryoga is."<p>"There wasn't anyone with Ryoga though," Akane pointed out.<p>"That's why I'm worried, Daisuke said there was someone with Ryoga and that the person was also looking for me, if he or she wasn't there today I have a feeling there is a reason we didn't see them."<p>"Huh," Akane and Nabiki chimed in.<p>"My enemies usually just show up and try to beat me, if there's someone using there head, we're doomed," Ranma ignored the face-faults from his two walking companions.<p>"Well we can concentrate on that later, right now you should be paying attention to Ryoga, he didn't really listen to what we said and seems to still want his revenge on you," Akane reminded him<p>"I know, but all I can really do is beat him the next time he shows up and hope he'll give up his little quest for revenge," before Akane or Nabiki could say anything else Ranma put in, "anyway we're home now, let's just enjoy a nice relaxing evening."<p>Ranma opened the gate and walked in. As soon as he was through the gate he ducked a blow aimed for his head, catching the offenders arm and throwing them into the wall.<p>Looking over Ranma saw his father lying in a slumped heap against the wall.<p>"Getting sloppy pops," Ranma taunted as he and Akane walked to the house, leaving Genma in a heap and Nabiki staring in shock at how fast weird things tended to happen around Ranma.<p>"Boy, you don't want to go in there, trust me, my-our lives depend upon it."<p>Ranma ignored his father's pathetic cries and continued into the house.<p>"Tadaima," Akane and Ranma called as they entered the Tendo home.<p>"Ranma, you have a visitor," Kasumi answered the two.<p>Ranma glanced at Akane who just shrugged; the two followed Kasumi into the dining room and stopped.<p>Sitting there at the table was his mother. Feelings of love, panic, dread, and a few other emotions he couldn't catalogue surged up within Ranma.<p>"M-mo-mother," Ranma managed to get the word past the lump in his throat.<p>"Hello son, please sit, I believe it is time for us to talk," Nodoka's voice was colder than Ranma or Akane could remember and she had a dangerous glint in her eyes.<p>The two moved and sat opposite the Saotome matriarch.<p>"Ranma, it is time for us to discuss a certain pledge you made before you and your father left all those years ago."<p>The feelings of dread and panic began winning over in Ranma as his mother spoke, but he just sat there tight lipped while the colour drained from Akane's face.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere Else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"This does not bode well for the godslayer," the cloaked figure intoned.<p>"You can say that again," muttered the armoured figure.<p>"How do you think this particular development will turn out?"<p>"With that honour bound bitch things can't go well."<p>"Well that is to be expected from a Tormite," the cloaked figured acknowledged.<p>"Expected, but not wanted."<p>The two watched as Nodoka Saotome mentioned a particular contract that affected all of the members of the Saotome family.<p>"Oh Hades," both figured exclaimed.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 14, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>AN: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>A Tormite is a follower of Torm, Torm is the god of duty from Forgotten Realms, and somehow he just seemed appropriate for Nodoka.<p>As for the pony-tailed comment by Ryoga, in the series Ranma has a ponytail up to the point where he eats the dragon's whisker. After that since he has to have the dragon's whisker, he wears his hair braided.<p>Hopefully with the latest clues I've dropped there are some people out there who can figure out who Ryoga's traveling companion is.<p>Well Kodachi has now been introduced to the storyline, she'll make her appearance to the other characters soon enough.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send an e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
