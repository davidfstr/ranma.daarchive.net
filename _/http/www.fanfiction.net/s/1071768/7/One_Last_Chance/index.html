</div>One Last Chance ch.7<p>**** A Time to Train****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. In the last chapter Akane and Ranma went on their first date together. Upon returning back home, the two found a pair of suitors waiting for them, courtesy of Genma and Soun's past. The suitors were a pair of twins called Miura and Kyushin Kusaragi, two practitioners of the all out school of elementally art. Our heroes of course beat the two in a martial arts match using a very impressive technique. The two have planned on leaving for a few days on a training trip, but first, the second day of school.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outside Tokyo, in the wilderness, later that evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Are we almost there yet." Akane was impatient, tired, sore, and hungry.<p>"Closer then we were last time you asked." Ranma was merely impatient and hungry.<p>The two had been walking for a few hours and it was beginning to get dark. Akane and Ranma had been walking since they left the Tendo residence. Ranma refused to let them take any form of transportation beyond their own legs.<p>Oh yeah, that baka calls it training, more like torture, I'm sure he's just laughing it up. If I complain, I'm sure he'll just call me a weak tomboy.<p>Ranma was well aware of Akane's growing ire, and he had a sneaky suspicion that it was directed at him.<p>What does she expect, it's training, I can't just carry her pack for her if she expects to get stronger. Is that what she's angry about? I swear that I'll never understand her.<p>"OK."<p>"Ok what Ranma?"<p>"We're here."<p>Akane's face lit up, all she wanted to do was go to sleep and get some rest before getting up to train tomorrow.<p>"Finally, I thought we were never going to get here."<p>"Well we are, let's set up camp here and get some sleep, the next few days are going to be quite busy. I imagine that we'll be shattered by the end. But it'll be worth it to get back up to where we were before we came here."<p>"Do you really think we'll be able to get ourselves back up to as good as we were in such a short time."<p>Ranma shook his head, "I don't think we'll be able to get back to as strong and fast as we were in such a short time as the next couple of days, but this will at least be a step in the right direction."<p>"Ok, let's get to bed."<p>The two began searching through their packs for their tents. After a couple minutes searching Akane stopped and looked at Ranma.<p>"Ranma."<p>"Yeah Akane?"<p>"I think our dads removed the tent from my pack."<p>Just like them, doing everything they can to force Akane and me together even when we've already said we want to be together. How stupid can you get? Ranma really wanted to say some less then nice things about their fathers, but he thought better of it.<p>"That's ok, I have my tent and you can use it if you want to."<p>"Where will you sleep Ranma?"<p>"I'll just sleep under the stars, did plenty of that with pops when we were traveling. You can take the tent."<p>"That's ok Ranma, I trust you not to do anything too improper."<p>Ranma froze as he was setting up his tent when Akane's words sunk into him.<p>"What do you mean by too improper Akane?" Ranma gulped.<p>Akane smiled sweetly, "I'm just saying I wouldn't be opposed to a little cuddling, after all we are fiancées so I'm sure no one would object. After all there's no one else here to object and no fathers forcing us into marriage even if they were here to see us."<p>Ranma, surprised at the changes his fiancée's attitude had gone through in the past couple of days. Akane had never been this forward with him and he was constantly being surprised by this new Akane.<p>"Really Akane?"<p>"Definitely."<p>Ranma had his tent set up in record time and decided not to have a snack before going to bed that night.<p>The tent was a small dome tent, but large enough to fit two people as long they were prepared to share the space. Ranma crawled into his sleeping bag and lay down, ready to get some sleep that night, and hoping he could actually get some sleep that night with his fiancée lying right beside him.<p>He closed his eyes and hoped for pleasant dreams, as Akane got ready to sleep.<p>Ranma's eyes jolted open, as his sleeping bag was unzipped. He saw Akane leaning over him and smiling at him.<p>"A-Akane, what are you doing?" Ranma stammered.<p>"I told you baka, I said I wouldn't mind some cuddling and so that's what I'm going to do, any objections?"<p>"Nope, none at all. So all you want to do is cuddle?"<p>"Well I wouldn't mind a goodnight kiss either." Akane said as lay down next to him pulling her unzipped sleeping bag over the two of them.<p>"You wish is my command." Ranma lowered his head, lips brushing against Akane's own. She hungrily pressed her lips harder onto his. Capturing his head with her hands so he couldn't pull away. Of course the thought of pulling away was the farthest thing from Ranma's mind at that moment.<p>Eventually breaking the kiss Akane lay her head against his chest. He wrapped his arms around her body holding her protectively to him.<p>"Sleep well my beautiful fiancee." Ranma whispered into her hair.<p>"Sleep well my love." Akane replied into his chest<p>Like that the two fell asleep, sharing each other's presence as the two fiancées practically glowed of contentment.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wilderness, campsite, early morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Training trip, Day 1<p>The sun was just beginning to rise as Ranma awoke.<p>Man that was one of the best nights sleep I've ever gotten. I guess I'd forgotten how good it was to camp out. I guess Akane and me are going to have to do this more often. Speaking of Akane, I wonder if she's ready to train today.<p>Ranma's train of thought was interrupted when something in his arms moved. It was at this point that the half-awake Ranma became the fully awake Ranma as he realized that there was something lying on his chest and that he had his arms around said object.<p>The object in question appeared to be warm, soft, and marginally heavy. Looking down Ranma made several more observations in his personal quest to discover what said object was. Ranma felt hair on his face and breathed in. The object smelled very nice and was in all likelihood human or demi-human, Ranma having encountered both over his life. If the feeling Ranma was getting from his torso was correct the object's chest wasn't as flat as a male's should be.<p>For a moment Ranma panicked and thought that Shampoo had snuck into his bed again, but the smell and the colour of the hair were wrong.<p>Memories of last night came back to Ranma and of Akane being the one who had them sleeping like this. This actually increased Ranma's curiosity, Akane always kicked, punched, and tossed in her sleep. Ryoga had informed Ranma of this while he had been pretending to be Akane's little pet pig. Ranma was amazingly comfortable and had slept great.<p>I just hope she remembers that as well before she decides to pound me.<p>The object now having been identified as one Akane Tendo began to stir in his arms.<p>"Good morning sleepyhead." Ranma said, giving the object in his arms a gentle squeeze and kissing the top of her head.<p>"RANMA WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY TENT?" Ranma closed his eyes and tensed up ready for the pounding he was about to receive, it was obvious by her tone of voice that Akane didn't remember that she had been the one who suggested the sleeping arrangements.<p>To his great surprise he felt Akane move up in his arms and kiss him on the lips.<p>"Good morning Ranma, I hope you slept as well as I did." Akane's voice was sweet and pleasant. Ranma wasn't prepared for that, but neither was he going to complain about not being beaten.<p>"Your not mad with me?" Ranma asked, knowing he shouldn't' risk Akane's ire, but not being able to help himself.<p>"Why should I be mad at you?"<p>"Well I'm lying here with you under covers in a tent, aren't you going to get angry?"<p>"No, you're nice and warm and soft and smell nice, I'm not angry, you're comfy."<p>Ranma came to the conclusion that Akane must not be completely awake yet. The portion of him that was prone to putting his foot in his mouth was tempted to say something along the lines of, 'well that's good for you, you don't have some heavy tomboy laying on you.' but thankfully for him that wasn't what came out.<p>"A guy could get used to waking up this way."<p>Akane smiled and rested her head back on his chest, moving a little to try and get comfortable.<p>"Umm Akane, we need to get up and eat breakfast so we can start training."<p>"Just five more minutes ok?"<p>Ranma knew they should get up; it was best to start training in the morning so they'd have more time to work and train. That was the reason they had come out here in the first place wasn't it. To improve their bodies they'd need to work hard over the next couple of days.<p>At the same time Ranma felt safe and loved here holding the woman he loved in his arms. He was comfortable and happy just lying there. Ranma really didn't want to leave, here with Akane he felt whole, as if something that had always been missing from his life had been found.<p>Ranma was truly torn over the issue.<p>On one hand training and being the best martial artist there was. This meant getting out of the sleeping bags and dragging Akane with him so they could train. The bonus to this was that they'd be more ready for the coming troubles that the two of them would have when the other fiancées and rivals began to show up.<p>On the other hand Akane was the woman he loved, she loved him, and Ranma knew it. Laying here with Akane was one of the greatest things he'd ever had the pleasure of enjoying. After all Akane and him had gone through, didn't they deserve a little peace and happiness together without anyone trying to pull them apart or push them together? Here together there was no chance of anything like that happening so they could indulge themselves and enjoy themselves.<p>His father would have said, 'A martial artist must always put martial arts first, never allowing personal comfort to interfere with one's training.' Thinking of his father's advice made up Ranma's mind for him.<p>Marital arts could wait. He wrapped his arms around Akane and relaxed, closing his eyes and savoring the feel of her body and heartbeat, the smell of her hair, and the sound of her rhythmic breathing.<p>"Ok Akane, we can take as many five minutes as we want to." Akane was almost back to sleep and just murmured unintelligibly before dropping back into dreamland.<p>At that point he couldn't care less about training. Ranma lay there just savoring the moment before eventually drifting off into a blissful slumber.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wilderness, campsite, afternoon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>For a fall day it was almost perfect (Please note that this definition of a perfect day is merely the author's idea of what some would consider a perfect day and by no means is any reflection of what a perfect day really is. As a matter of fact, the author is a very strange and twisted person and prefers cold overcast days with no hint of sun or sunlight anywhere to what is about to be described. As such he will understand if some readers disagree with the following description.).<p>The sun was shining brightly with a scattering of clouds here and there. The air was almost perfect, the humidity was just right, it was hot, but not overly oppressive in its heat, and there was a nice cool breeze blowing through the trees causing a slight rustling and swaying in the foliage.<p>The Two martial artists whom, to a casual observer appeared to be in the process of killing each other, were training. To a more interested observer, considering the impressive martial arts performance the two were giving there would be few disinterested enough not to fall into this category, the two appeared to be going through a very intense sparring match.<p>In actuality the pair of individuals in question were having the time of their lives. Although, their decision to sleep in earlier could give the sparring session a run for its money in that department.<p>Akane stepped back from her fiancée, dropping her hands to her sides in an unspoken symbol. Ranma at seeing the signal to take a break likewise stepped back and dropped out of his stance.<p>"Want something to drink?" Akane asked, retrieving their canteens from where they lay, also picking up two towels.<p>"Sure that sounds great."<p>Akane threw both a canteen and towel at Ranma, who deftly caught them without a thought.<p>"Thanks."<p>"No problem."<p>The two went over to a newly fallen tree that Akane had recently felled when she made sure she could still perform the Kachyu Tenshin Amaguriken. As the evidence suggested, she was definitely still capable of performing it.<p>The couple sat down against the fallen tree's trunk, Akane sitting at a slight angle so as to rest against Ranma's body as well as the tree. Ranma had no problem with this and shifted slightly so as to allow his fiancée to be more comfortable.<p>"I can't believe how slow I used to be." Akane complained, rotating her shoulder and stretching slightly so as to work out some knots.<p>"Neither can I, I'm amazed I survived with my body as weak and slow as this, but then again, that's why we're here, to make sure our bodies are more prepared for when the rest of the insanity arrives."<p>"Well the others weren't that strong at the beginning either Ranma, so with our improved technique we'll have an even easier time then before. I mean even you yourself said that I was skilled enough to take on Shampoo and most likely win."<p>"That's not good enough Akane, I want you to be able to beat Shampoo without breaking a sweat. Then there's Cologne, if we can't get rid of Shampoo the right way, then there's a chance Cologne will show up, and I'm not sure how good she was or is. I'd rather keep her out of this if at all possible. With all the magic, herbs, and other strange tricks she has the chances of something happening are much greater."<p>"First things first, Ryoga is the first one to arrive." Akane began to fume at the thought of Ryoga.<p>"Yeah, he is the first one we have to deal with. If at all possible, I'd like to find some way to make peace with him so he won't be constantly attacking me screaming, 'Ranma prepare to die.'"<p>"That pervert, why would you want any help from him after all the abuse he put you and me through, all the problems he caused, and all the trouble he was responsible for? I think it's best for you to just beat him into a pulp every time you see him, eventually he'll get the idea."<p>"True, but out of all the others, Ryoga was the strongest, he was the only one who consistently gave me a challenge. If we had him as an ally, it would be a lot easier and safer to take on any threats, which will come."<p>"Ranma, Ryoga tried to kill you on several occasions."<p>Ranma shook his head resolutely.<p>"He was never serious about killing me, he just wanted a fight."<p>"That's not true, what about his breaking point attack, he tried to hit you with it. He didn't know it wouldn't work on you and he went full out trying to hit you with it. I saw what it did to those rocks he was hit with. If it worked on you as it did on those rocks there would have been no, 'oops, sorry Ranma, I didn't mean too.' You would have been dead and no amount of apologies would have changed that."<p>"I believe we should forgive everyone for what hasn't happened yet and for what did happen. It wouldn't be right to hold a grudge against any of them for actions which they may not even commit."<p>"Does that include what has happened between the two of us until now?"<p>"Akane, I've always forgiven you for everything, I just hope you can also forgive me for all of the stupid things I've done up to this point."<p>Akane put her hand on his cheek.<p>"How could I not forgive you my love? I mean, are you even capable of bearing a grudge?"<p>Ranma laughed slightly at the question, but after a moment's contemplation became quite serious and began to frown as one individual came to his mind.<p>"Usually no, but there are always exceptions to every rule, and I think can think of one old lecherous pervert who needs to be taught a lesson."<p>Akane's mirth also drained away as realization dawned on her of just who Ranma was thinking of, Akane's expression grew even darker than it had been when she was thinking of Ryoga.<p>"Death would be too merciful for that pervert, just how exactly are we going to deal with him?"<p>"I'm not sure yet, I've mostly been thinking about the fiancées and rivals, but I promise you this. Even if I have to kill him the lech will not trouble us for long. After all that he has done to us I find I can't even consider forgiving him."<p>Ranma's words cast Akane's thoughts were cast back to all that Happosai had put the two of them through, all his groping, all his abuse, all his schemes, all his pettiness. While she was usually a kind person, on the inside at least, and forgave people pretty quickly, she found no shred of forgiveness anywhere in her being for the perverted founder of the anything goes school.<p>She turned to look Ranma straight in the eyes; her chocolate brown orbs meeting Ranma's own grey-blue eyes.<p>"Ranma, I also promise you this, as you killed to save me, I would kill to save you. If that means ending the unnatural life of one old pervert then I am willing to live with that."<p>The incident at Jusendo where Ranma had killed Saffron, a demi-god to save Akane's life came back to Ranma. Although he'd deny it if anyone pointed it out he became somewhat misty eyed.<p>"I'll never let anyone take you away from me Akane and nothing will ever take me away from you."<p>"Ohhhh Ranma, is it possible to fall in love with someone you're already in love with?"<p>Akane had meant it as a rhetorical question, but surprisingly received an answer.<p>"Yes Akane it is, and I should know."<p>"Huh, I thought you said you fell in love with me when we first met."<p>"I did, then later when the lech first came and our fathers tried to make me bow to him and be subservient to him I refused. They kicked me out of the house rather then risk his childish revenge. Remember that?"<p>"Yes I do, you refused to wear a bra like he wanted you to."<p>"Well when I was sitting in that lot camping out in the cold, I was really unhappy about being kicked out and felt kinda depressed. Then out of nowhere this you came with some food and drink for me, all bundled up and ready to stay with me if need be and we came up with that plan to get the old pervert back. Suddenly after you got there everything was much better and my depression went away. I now realize why I was so depressed."<p>Ranma had slipped his arms around Akane and was holding her to him, she was leaning back contently into him.<p>"It wasn't that I had been kicked out of a nice place to stay, I had gotten used to that over the years and had slept in a lot of worse places than that tent in the lot. It wasn't even that I was without pop, at a young age I had gotten used to relying on myself. It was you Akane, having you there with me made me feel so right and so much better. Not having pop, Nabiki, your dad, Kasumi, or even Kasumi's cooking were nothing compared to not being able to be around you. I think at that point I fell in love with you all over again and nothing anyone else did could change that fact."<p>Akane felt herself flush at the memory. When Happosai had first come the two of them had refused to give any ground to the old pervert, although Akane had been tempted to give in just so she could be rid of him, but not Ranma, Ranma would never bow to anyone. They had refused to give in to the pervert and eventually sent him packing; they always sent him packing whenever he tried something.<p>"For a time," she murmured softly, but not softly enough to escape Ranma's sharp ears.<p>"What do you mean by that Akane?"<p>"I was just thinking about how whenever we'd get rid of that old pervert, he would always come back with some new scheme or some new problem."<p>"Like Pantyhose Taro?"<p>"Exactly, we'd get rid of him, but it would never be enough, he'd always come back and we'd have to set whatever he did wrong right again. Like those magnetically charged pills that were making you subservient to him, the moxibustion of weakness, or the personality splitter incense."<p>A sob escaped Akane at the memory, causing Ranma to tighten his arms around her.<p>"You never gave in, but a couple of times I came so close to losing you, once to him, once to weakness, and once to yourself. Then there were all the others things he did to us. Trying to make you or me love him, trying to keep you as a girl, all the other things. I can't take it again; we have to stop him before he can do it to us. I don't care what we have to do as long as we stop that monster  he can kill us again."<p>Tears slid down Akane's cheeks as she cried. Ranma began to rock slightly making soothing sounds.<p>"Don't worry Akane, I promise you we'll deal with him when he comes along."<p>'I know Ranma, I know, but I can't help but worry."<p>The two just sat there in contemplative silence for a while, both content in the other's embrace.<p>"Well Akane, we had better get back to our training if we are going to beat them."<p>"You're on Ranma."<p>With their brief breather and conversation completed. Neither really felt like continuing talking about such a depressing topic as dealing with the one responsible for their deaths.<p>As such, the pair threw themselves into their training with great gusto and vigor, trying to forget their troubles in the art they loved so much.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wilderness, campsite, late evening ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>The two martial artists had kept training for the rest of the day non-stop, Ranma putting Akane and himself through constant speed and endurance training. After the conversation they had during their first break, neither fiancée had struck up much conversation during any of the other breaks they took.<p>It wasn't until dinner that night that the two had resumed their discussion. Ranma had cooked dinner that night with surprisingly little complaint from Akane. She was too tired to object forcefully, that and she didn't particularly want to go through the trouble of cooking that night.<p>After the massage Ranma had given her, she was too relaxed to want to trouble herself or her relaxed body with the hardships of cooking. Subconsciously, she also knew that the two of them would sleep much better if they ate Ranma's cooking, not that she'd ever tell him that.<p>"Ughh, my body feels like it's made out of lead" Akane groused as she lay on their shared sleeping tent. Ranma had asked her if she had wanted to change their sleeping arrangements for that night. Akane had gotten slightly irritated at him, assuming that he didn't like the sleeping arrangements.<p>Thankfully Ranma had managed to explain what he really meant to Akane's satisfaction before mallet-sama had finished descending and was spared Akane's wrath. Akane had then told Ranma that she liked them as they were, seductively suggesting they might even wear a little less than they did the previous night. Ranma had flushed at the suggestion, but didn't object.<p>Ranma was outside the tent at that moment cleaning the utensils they had used for dinner and disposing the trash, there was no leftover food to dispose of seeing as the appetites of the two fiancées was more then sufficient to consume their meal.<p>With the cleanup done Ranma joined his fiancée in their shared tent and lay down on his sleeping bag beside his fiancée. Akane in turn pulled her sleeping bag over the two of them to act as a blanket.<p>Under their shared covers Ranma's arms snaked around his fiancée as she rested her head upon his chest, taking in his scent and marveling at just how comfortable he was.<p>For both martial artists, all the hardships and troubles of the day seemed to melt seeming small and far away as Ranma held Akane to him.<p>"I could stay like this forever." Akane said, moving so she practically lay on top of her fiancée.<p>"I couldn't agree more, everything and everyone else seem so far away at this point, so unimportant. All that I care about I have in my arms." Ranma adjusted his body as he spoke to better allow for his fiancée's movements. Akane seemed to stir at Ranma's comment.<p>"What about our families and friends?"<p>"Akane as far as families go I didn't exactly get a good pick. My father is a man, who would sell or engage his son many times over to feed his own stomach, beat his child if he showed emotions, starved his child, threw his only son into a pit of starving cats wrapped in fish products, and forced me to hide from my own mother after taking and cursing me."<p>Akane heard Ranma's voice begin to break as he reached the nekoken training. She had always known Ranma never had an easy childhood, but she had tried not to think about it before knowing it was even now breaking her heart to think of the man she loved in so much pain, but Ranma still wasn't done.<p>"Then there's my mother, oh god, I had to hide from my own mother because she might want to take my life if she found out about something that happened to me that I have no control over, then after the lies were told it was too late, I couldn't face telling her the truth over who I really was, it hurt us both so much and I never realized just how much it hurt till now."<p>Another sob tore at Ranma, making Akane's heart wrench even more. Looking up at him in the pale moonlight she noticed that even with this much pain he refused to allow himself to cry. Ranma was fighting back tears with every word he had spoken. She moved her head up and placed a feather light kiss on his lips.<p>"Ranma, that was the other future, it doesn't have to happen that way this time. When your mother does come we will explain the situation right from the start this time and things will be fine. As for your father, that part of your life is over Ranma, he can't force you into anything else. Just remember that even without them you will have me and I will always be there for you whenever you need me."<p>Ranma looked down at Akane, awe, wonder, and love written clearly across his face.<p>"Akane."<p>"Yes Ranma?"<p>"I think I just fell in love with you again."<p>Akane laughed softly before returning her head to her pillow, namely Ranma's chest.<p>"I love you too, now maybe we should get some sleep for tomorrow."<p>"Ok love."<p>"Sleep well Ranma."<p>"You too Akane, and may flights of angels sing thee too thy rest."<p>"I'm sure you will."<p>The two were shortly asleep.<p>Ten yards away from their camp a figure walked onwards, his pace steady and determined, his course taking him steadily forwards. He never noticed the last dying embers from the campfire a certain pigtailed martial artist had extinguished not too long ago.<p>"Ranma Saotome, because of you I've seen hell, the time for your demise draws close. Prepare yourself."<p>With those words spoken the dark figure continued walking onwards towards his goal.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Well, I must say that was a close call" The cloaked figure turned to look at the seated one, wiping a drop of sweat from its brow as it turned.<p>"A little bit more of a push and he would have stumbled straight onto them. Slightly disappointing wouldn't you agree." The seated figure sighed.<p>"Ahh yes, but they say patience is a virtue and I do believe it is too early for him to make an appearance in this little drama we have unfolding."<p>"So what are you going to do about him?"<p>"Nothing for now, but eventually I'll get around to working on him." The seated figure promised.<p>"So what are you going to do about this situation until then, those two seem to be getting quite close to each other?"<p>"I'm not sure, I'm tempted to allow the god slayer and his mate to continue as they are, she also has a lot of potential and would be a good match for the god slayer. I'm tempted to bring her into the fold as well."<p>The cloaked figure regarded its seated companion with a quizzical look.<p>"Trying to take both of Loki's chosen. If I weren't so sure that you are in your right state of mind at current, I'd swear you had finally gone insane. Loki would never stand idly by while you tried to take his two favored for your own purposes. You know as well as I do that he loves watching the chaos that surrounds them and often assists in it. If he finds someone is messing with them he'll be pretty angry."<p>"I will worry about that problem when we get to it, but at the moment all that concerns me is making sure the god slayer becomes what he is destined to be. If that means allowing this chosen mate to remain at his side longer then so be it, but should it prove prudent to break the bonds that these two share, I will not hesitate to act. Their happiness is second place to destiny."<p>"So you would defy the will of a majority of greater gods, lesser gods, demon lords, demons, and spirits. Just because you believe in this destiny, you are taking a rather large risk."<p>"Do you doubt in what this young man's destiny may hold." The seated figure stood up, armor and stalked over to face the cloaked figure, its blue eyes glinting dangerously as if reinforcing the validity of its claim.<p>"Not at all, but destiny is not set in stone nor is it always to come to pass as has been foretold. It is a fluid entity, in and of itself and will come as it needs to be." The darkness from under the cloaked figure's hood was too deep to see its eyes as it spoke.<p>"Then there is no problem with us giving it a few gentle nudges in the right direction."<p>"I've seen more gentle nudges from Thor and his hammer compared to what you have been doing. You know as well as I do that you walk a dangerous path."<p>"True, but with the god slayer at my side things will progress much more smoothly. After he took care of that demi-god upstart Saffron, do you have any idea how many beings wanted him disposed of. I'm amazed he and his fiancée were brought back in time."<p>"Loki always has been a very persuasive being, with the other chaos deities backing him rather than there usual infighting they stood a very good chance of getting their way, and they did." The cloaked figure smiled in admiration at the thought of Loki's threatened Armageddon.<p>"That's right isn't it, if I was one who was akin to praying I might thank Loki, but since I'm not, I'll just have to thank the god slayer instead."<p>The armored figure began to laugh at its own statement.<p>The cloaked figure for the sake of continuity joined in.<p>The two figures laughed.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TBC, END OF CHAPTER 7 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>AN: So ends another chapter of the story. Except for chapter one, I think this is the most serious chapter I've written yet. I am slightly displeased with how little humour I could bring into it, but it seemed to work better with a more serious tone and many of these topics were things I wasn't willing to make light of them. Incidentally, this also happens to be my longest chapter and required more work then the others. While I enjoy writing I believe I received less fun writing this chapter then the others. This probably had to do with the lack of humor. I am trying to keep this light and enjoyable rather then too deep and heavy. Although I will warn you that there may be some more chapters as emotional if not more so than this one. We will just have to wait and see what happens.<p>Who will be the next rival/fiancée/challenge to show up and face the two of them? They still have three more days in which to practice and prepare, or will they encounter another challenge on their journey. Will the training trip end next chapter or will it continue on for a good three more chapters.<p>How will the story progress from here, who among you besides me knows or suspects what will happen? What will happen to our heroes now that they are alone with each other and sharing their feelings without interruption?<p>More clues, more secrets, and more mystery come from the two figures. Maybe soon their identity will be revealed, and what is the armoured figure's agenda with Ranma. Most of all just how exactly are these two manipulating the two and the people around them. These two will have more lines and a larger part of the story as it goes along, who knows soon I may even reveal their name.<p>Let me know how this chapter has turned out. Please Read and Review. I welcome your comments, criticism, and all manner of responses, although I really don't like the flames that much. I must say that I am also grateful to know so many people are reading this fanfic and are seemingly enjoying it.<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me and have me respond please E-mail me at<p>-Rhuobhe26
