</div><p>One Last Chance ch.2</p><p>Revised</p><p>First Fight twice</p><p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takashi, as to my knowledge no one has ever actually gotten sued for writing a Ranma ½ fanfic, even those that make Dojins and actually get money for it so the disclaimer is rather pointless, but here it is anyway.</p><p>AN: Ranma-chan denotes female, Ranma for male, this is used to help avoid confusion about what gender the aqua-transsexual happens to be during a scene. Much like he/she use.</p><p>"speech"</p><p>'Thoughts'</p><p><i>signs </i></p><p><b>scene change/flashback </b></p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>In the last chapter Ranma and Akane were killed by a demon sent by Happosai. Ranma made a wish to have a second chance at life. When last chapter left off Ranma and Genma had just entered the Tendo home and Soun fainted at discovering he was a she.</p><p><b>Tendo House</b></p><p>'Oh yeah, Just like last time' Ranma-chan thought with a smirk. The last thing he remembered was talking to a goddess and then waking up over his father's shoulder.</p><p>'Well I guess this is as good a time as any to start, considering I have my memories, too bad she couldn't have restored my memories before I went swimming in a certain cursed pool or beat a certain Amazon.' He thought kneeling in front of Soun who was slowly regaining consciousness.</p><p>"This is all your fault daddy. You should have checked first."</p><p>"But Saotome said he had a son."</p><p>"Does this look like a son too you?" Nabiki growled reaching over and grabbing one of Ranma's breasts.</p><p>"I really wish you'd stop that."</p><p>"Leave him alone Nabiki. He's a guest." Ranma was thankful for the assistance, but wait a second.</p><p>'She used 'he' and 'him' even though she's only seen me as a girl, but wait could that mean?' Ranma smiled inwardly and prayed that she was right. Se felt a hand on her shoulder and turned to see Akane's smiling face.</p><p>"Hi, I'm Akane, want to be friends?" Ranma felt her heart sing at the beautiful smile. She smiled back at her and followed the youngest Tendo out to the dojo.</p><p>When they got into the dojo Akane turned back to face the redhead, "You practice Kenpo don't you?"</p><p>Ranma-chan nodded in response.</p><p>"Then why don't we have ourselves a little match?" Ranma nodded again. Akane dropped into a stance in front of her.</p><p>"Ready?" Akane asked with a smile.</p><p>"If you." Ranma cut himself off in shock, 'Wait a minute she was meant to say, 'Don't worry I won't hurt you.'' Ranma returned the smile.</p><p>Ranma-chan assumed the same relaxed stance she had used the first time she sparred with Akane.</p><p>Akane charged forwards and threw a punch. She telegraphed the move however and Ranma-chan leapt above it. She didn't jump high enough though and had to twist out of the way at the last second to avoid the punch.</p><p>Akane came at her again, this time letting loose a series of kicks and punches which backed Ranma-chan into a wall.</p><p>Akane's next punch broke through the dojo's wall. Ranma-chan's jump took her over Akane and onto the other side of her. Akane seemed a lot more skilled then Ranma remembered her to be at first.</p><p>The read head smiled in remembrance as she reached out to tap the other girl on the back of the head, only to find Akane's arm blocking the spot she was going to touch.</p><p>"You get the feeling we've done this before?" Akane asked with a smile as she turned around.</p><p>"Yeah almost like it happened one year, eleven months, fifteen days ago." He grinned even more as it was Akane's turn to go into shock.</p><p>"Ranma is that you?" She asked, her voice full of hope.</p><p>"Akane, it's me"</p><p>The two martial artists rushed forwards, meeting each other in an embrace.</p><p>"Oh Ranma, it is you." Akane sobbed into the other girl's shoulder</p><p>"Yes Akane, we have a second chance at life just like the goddess promised. This time, I'm not going to screw it up by waiting till it's too late to tell you."</p><p>Dropping onto one knee she held the stunned girl's hand between her own, "Akane Tendo, I love you, will you marry me?" Akane practically glowed at his words.</p><p>"I love you too Ranma Saotome, of course I'll marry you." They stayed there for a minute, just staring into each other's eyes. Akane pulled the kneeling girl up and wrapped her arms around the shorter girl, leaning her head against her shoulder.</p><p>"Umm Akane."</p><p>"Yes Ranma?"</p><p>"I'm still a girl you know." Akane squeezed the red haired girl tighter into herself.</p><p>"I don't care, boy or girl, you're still my baka."</p><p>"And you're my tomboy." Ranma-chan finished. The two separated.</p><p>"Ranma how long have you, well you know, been able to remember?" Akane asked</p><p>"I guess about the time I woke up on pop's shoulder, I'm not sure since I have all my memories, but I can't seem to remember remembering before that. If that makes any sense?"</p><p>"Yeah, it kind of does, it's the same way with me, only when I woke up this morning it was like waking up from a dream that you can remember, I remember yesterday like it was yesterday, but I also remember two years from now the same way. It's actually easier not to think about it too long or you'll get a headache."</p><p>"Well Akane, let's continue your lesson from where we left off before we. Well, you know." Ranma had a little trouble bringing himself to actually saying it now, for some reason. The two bowed to each other before assuming their own stances.</p><p>This was one thing that had changed shortly after Jusendo. Ranma's fear for Akane's life had overweighed his fear of hurting her and so had begun to train her for real. It had taken a while, but eventually he had fixed the mistakes that Soun had made while training his daughter. The most telling improvement was when Akane had learnt the Katchyuu Tenshin Amaguriken.</p><p><b>Flash back/flash forwards/time travel is confusing, Tendo Dojo </b></p><p>"Ok Akane, it's quite simple, all you have to do is concentrate and you can get it." Ranma offered helpfully. Akane just shot him a glare.</p><p>"So says the martial arts prodigy with an insufferable ego, jerk." Akane grumbled.</p><p>When he had told her he was going to train her in the Katchyuu Tenshin Amaguriken. She had been delighted, but after Tofu had been forced to treat her burns a few times she wasn't quite so enthusiastic anymore. 'Who knew training could hurt so much.'</p><p>The only reason she kept trying so hard was her insufferable fiancée kept egging her on. She wouldn't give the pervert the satisfaction. Although he had switched from chestnuts in a fire, to goldfish in a tank, he had said it would be easier this way.</p><p>She couldn't believe she had actually argued with him on the switch.</p><p>"So you just going to sit there and look at it or are you actually going to try the technique?" Ranma's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>She wanted to mallet him so bad, but he hadn't let her until she learned the technique, she was really beginning to regret the promise she had made on that issue. The few times she had tried to mallet him he had taken it away from her and reminded her of the promise she had made. 'How was I to know it would take me so long to learn this, or that he was serious about not letting me hit him until I learned the technique.'</p><p>She yelled as her hands blurred, snatching the goldfish one by one out of the tank and putting them into a different one. When she finally stopped, her arms felt like they were going to fall off.</p><p>Next thing she knew, there was a towel in front of her, "Need this?" Ranma asked with a grin.</p><p>Akane was about to reach out and take it when she noticed her hands were still dry. She looked from one tank to another. One tank had no fish in it, while the other was full of them.</p><p>"Congratulations." Ranma said, reaching down and helping her to her feet. Akane looked him in the eyes; he didn't miss the malicious grin that spread across her face.</p><p>"So I've learned the technique now?" She asked sweetly.</p><p>"Yeah, took a bit longer then me, but you did learn it," he replied with his own cocky grin.</p><p>"You sure?"</p><p>"Positive," he replied becoming slightly nervous at her unwavering smile.</p><p>"Then you won't mind if I do this," she stated, pulling out mallet-sama. He quickly backed off.</p><p>Right as she was about to bring the mallet round to crush him she thought better of the idea.</p><p>"Come here Ranma." She cooed softly, dropping the mallet.</p><p>"Ummmm. I needta be somewhere else right now, sorry Kane." Ranma took off running. Akane was a moment behind him.</p><p>"Come back Ranma we need to celebrate." She yelled, "Let me demonstrate the technique for you."</p><p>"You really didn't need me, it was your accomplishment. Why doncha show your father?" He insisted, jumping onto the neighbor's roof. Akane followed her fleeing fiancée.</p><p>"Get back here or else I'll pound you into the ground Ranma…RANMA." She screamed chasing the scared youth.</p><p><b>Present/past/this is going to be confusing, Tendo Dojo </b></p><p>They had celebrated with some roof hopping, another technique that Ranma had helped Akane perfect, all around Nerima with Ranma leading and Akane following trying to 'demonstrate' her new technique to and on a fleeing Ranma. It was a very fond memory.</p><p>It had also been the last night they had shared together before Happosai's demon had killed the two of them.</p><p>Ranma adjusted his stance to start the lesson, but stopped before he could begin it.</p><p>"Ranma, what's wrong?" Akane asked, staring at her new/old fiancée who was standing before her and appeared to be twitching his limbs.</p><p>"Akane, I just realized something, it's this body, it feels strange."</p><p>"I thought you were used to your cursed form Ranma." The red head's eyes closed as she began throwing kicks and punches around the dojo, but there was something off about her technique, it looked hesitant and different, she suddenly snapped her eyes open and slapped a hand against her forehead.</p><p>"Akane, run through a warm up kata and you'll see what I mean." Akane cocked an eyebrow, but went into a simple kata.</p><p>She threw a punch, but it was slower than it should have been, while turning on a kick she almost fell over, it was like her center of gravity had moved. After clumsily finishing her form she stopped and looked at Ranma with confusion and a little fear in her eyes.</p><p>"S…Something's wrong with my body." If he hadn't experienced the confusion himself Ranma might have found Akane's expression amusing.</p><p>"It's not our bodies, it's our minds." Seeing Akane's confused look, Ranma continued his explanation. "Our minds are two years older than our bodies so we aren't used to something different from ourselves."</p><p>"Huh?", came her intelligent response.</p><p>"Think about it, these bodies are two years younger than what we're used too. We haven't trained them as much and so they are weaker, slower, and have less endurance. We still have all the knowledge we used to, but we aren't as capable of performing them." Akane looked crestfallen at this revelation.</p><p>"Does that mean I can no longer roof hop?"</p><p>"Nah, you could have done that any time, it just took you a while to build up enough confidence to try it, but enough talk, let's try out our new...um old bodies." They both dropped into stances, sparring slowly at first, but working up their speed as they went along. Ranma smiled.</p><p>"I think you're at about Shampoo's level when she arrived."</p><p>"Really?" Pictures of beating a certain Chinese bimbo with her own bonbori flashed through her head.</p><p>"Yeah, with a little bit of training you can beat her now, and you already know one trick she doesn't, the Katchyuu Tenshin Amaguriken."</p><p>"Can I perform it with this body though?"</p><p>"Sure, the technique is more about using your ki to enhance your punches and teaching the right way to throw the punches then it is about using the body's strength, it just takes training which we've both already been given you by me and me by Cologne. It won't be as effective with our old bodies since they aren't as physically fit, but we can still do it, and the better we train these bodies the more effective it becomes. All we've got to do is use the endurance, speed, and strength training now rather then later and we'll be better than we were before." Akane grinned evilly at this revelation, certain pictures of certain Chinese bimbos still dancing in her head.</p><p>She walked to the door, turned back and said, "I'm just glad you're a girl."</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma looked confused</p><p>"I'd really hate to loose to a boy." After saying this she walked out.</p><p>Ranma stared after her for a moment before bursting out in laughter. She was glad she didn't have any lines to say in response to that since she didn't know if she would be able to stop laughing long enough to get them out.</p><p>When she finished rolling around on the floor, she noticed Kasumi standing in the doorway looking at her.</p><p>"I thought you'd like to take a bath, I'm sure you must be all sweaty from your workout." Ranma was about to politely decline when an evil thought came to his mind.</p><p>"Why thank you Kasumi-san."</p><p>"Please Ranma-chan, just call me Kasumi."</p><p>Ranma took the loaned bathing supplies from Kasumi and headed for the furo.</p><p><b>Tendo house, a little bit afterwards </b></p><p>Later, Akane opened the door to the bathroom and stepped inside. She had waited longer this time to give Ranma a chance to get out of the furo rather then bump into him again. Looking around she couldn't see any of Ranma's clothes in the hamper so decided that he was gone.</p><p>Not this time around I guess. 'Too bad, this time I was actually hoping to get a better look at... bad Akane, bad Akane, he only just became your fiancé. Again for the first time in two years ago.' She pushed those thoughts out of her mind before they gave her a headache. She opened the door to the furo and stepped inside. What she saw made her drop her towel, showing more then she intended too.</p><p>Ranma from where he was sitting in the furo gave an appreciative whistle, "Ready for your massage?"</p><p>"Ranma no Hentai." Replied a blushing Akane, "Turn your head."</p><p>"Or else?" He asked with a cocky grin.</p><p>"It'll be imbedded in the wall and I'll call for daddy. Then I'll finish my demonstration of the technique you taught me." Ranma yelped and quickly complied with Akane's very reasonable demand while she covered herself and stepped into the furo facing away from him.</p><p>"Ok Ranma no Hentai, relax me." Ranma reached out, placing his hands on Akane's shoulders and began to massage her muscles; easing them after the heavy workout he gave her.</p><p>"If this was really two years ago, you'd have run off to find something to crush me with. What was it again a table or a stone statue?" It was amazing how much a simple declaration of love, and a marriage proposal that wasn't forced by family honor changed things between too people.</p><p>"I can't really remember."</p><p>The massages had been another thing that they'd started shortly after they began training together. Akane wasn't prepared for the intensity of the training and her muscles were causing her such pain that Ranma had carried her up to her room after she had collapsed the second night and massaged her body, easing the knots and strained muscles.</p><p>It had become like clockwork, Ranma and Akane would train and afterwards Akane would collapse face down onto her bed. Ranma would then sneak in and massage away her tension and strain, sneaking out so as not to alert the family as to their nightly ritual.</p><p>Ranma felt Akane loosening and falling asleep beneath his hands. He snuck one hand lower then usual and pinched her. She jumped up and turned around, looking down on him with a glare.</p><p>Ranma found his face right in front of Akane's nether regions. Akane looked at Ranma and saw his eyes were unfocused and staring straight ahead, she realized where his gaze was and sat back down instantly.</p><p>"Hentai." She said, punching him in the face.</p><p>"Cu..Cute tomboy." Ranma stuttered. Akane was about to hit him again when she thought over his words.</p><p>"What happened to Uncute tomboy, Ranma?" She noticed Ranma's eyes still weren't focused and slightly glazed as he answered her.</p><p>"Cute. very cute. never uncute." Akane smiled at his answer, when he was dazed he could actually be very nice. Maybe she should have flashed him like that sooner, 'Bad Girl, stop thinking like that.'</p><p>"Ok Ranma, what's your payment?" This was another part of their ritual. Akane wanted to pay back Ranma for the training session and massage, so she would let Ranma make a request, as long as it wasn't perverted.</p><p>The requests Ranma made would range from a simple hug too letting him sleep on a futon in her room, another thing he had been doing a lot since Jusendo.</p><p>'Although, maybe it would be fine now that they were engaged for a little perversion.' Akane's mind started to drift. 'I mean I never actually said nothing perverted, I just implied it rather emphatically.' Ranma mumbled something that Akane didn't quite hear, but did serve to bring her back to the here and now.</p><p>"What was that Ranma I didn't hear you?"</p><p>"I…I don't want Mikado to be my first kiss this time around." He told her blushing furiously. Akane was shocked, Ranma looked so meek as he made the request.</p><p>"Who do you want your first kiss to be with then, Ranma?" Akane asked, Ranma's blushed increased by a shade.</p><p>"The only person I ever want to kiss." Akane began to grin. It was like pulling teeth, but if he was going to make this request then he wasn't going to get off that easy, she was going to force him to ask her directly.</p><p>"And who would that be Ranma?"</p><p>"A Cute tomboy."</p><p>"What tomboy would that be then?"</p><p>"You know full well who I mean." He hissed, starting to get angry at how obtuse she was.</p><p>"Now who could it be?"</p><p>"Damn it Akane, you know I mean you."</p><p>She had had her fun, Ranma could only ever be pushed so far. "You have but to ask my dear fiancée."</p><p>"Damn it Kane, fine I want you to kiss me, you and only you, not Sanzenin, not Kuno, just you, there you happy?" His response came in the form of Akane's lips pressed against his own.</p><p>'YES, I'm Ranma's first kiss.' Akane's mind sung happily, 'And If I have my way the only one who kisses him.'</p><p>'YES, Akane's my first kiss.' Ranma's mind yelled in joy, 'and hopefully the only one who kisses me.'</p><p>They held the kiss for a minute before separating.</p><p>"Very" Akane purred in response to Ranma's question, before stepping out and into the changing room. Ranma could only sit there for several minutes before mumbling the one word that could express his feelings.</p><p>"WOW."</p><p>Before getting out of the furo, toweling off, and getting his clothes from out of the closet where he'd hidden them. Somehow Ranma had a feeling things were going to go a lot better this time around.</p><p>TBC, end of chapter 2</p><p>AN: As for not going to into the beginning bit where Ranma arrives, in more detail, let's face it this has been done so many times that it really isn't necessary, if you don't know what happens, read the manga, watch the anime, or read any one of dozens of other fanfics that go into it. So unless I actually wrote in a change just assume everything that happened in the actual series happened there too.</p><p>The comment about table or stone sculpture is a reference to the difference between the Manga, in which Akane runs outside and grabs a stone object, and Anime, where Akane runs into the living room and grabs the table.</p><p>The story will have elements from both the manga and the anime.</p><p>As for Ranma speaking more fluently then before, this has two reasons, in the Manga before things went to hell, Ranma spoke pretty well. The second reason is that since Ranma has been living among normal (a relative expression) people for nearly two years, he was able to get rid of some of his less favorable habits. Don't worry in times of stress he will fall back into his bad habits.</p><p>Once again please R/R, I enjoy reading the commentary, it helps a surprisingly large amount.</p><p>Revision Notes: Once again not many changes here, mostly spelling and grammatical errors or issues to fix with this chapter.</p><p>As for the violence from Akane and the insults from Ranma, those will be increased a bit from the old version. It's part of who the characters are and more importantly how they show their feelings for others. Making Akane a pacifist and Ranma polite is only one or two steps shy of rewriting everything about the series.</p><p>As I revise the story one of the things I am doing is carefully reading over the reviews left for each chapter. I appreciate comments from TerraEpon, Vixen2, Cupid's Bride, and all the other reviewers on everything from content to plot to spelling and grammar, even comments that think I am doing a horrible job or just copying I read and weigh the reviewer's opinion. I am in fact Scottish, but have spent a good portion of my life in the American education system and as such regularly mix the two written languages. Such as the spellings of honour, armour, and other words. For convenience of reading one of the things I will do as I go through is make sure all the words are the Americanized version. Hopefully this will make the story less awkward to read.</p><p>-rhuobhe26</p>
