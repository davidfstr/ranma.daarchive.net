</div>One Last Chance ch.13<p>**** All In the Family ****<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ and all it's characters were created by Rumiko Takahashi I in no way take credit for them, don't sue, this is just a story for entertainment purposes and I am making no money off it.<p>AN: Quick personal disclaimer, I am writing this for fun, I do not enjoy flames, I welcome constructive criticisms and thoughtful advice.<p>"Speech"<p>Thoughts<p>* Sound effects *<p>~~~~Scene change/flashback~~~~~~<p>{Signs}<p>Ranma and Akane died thanks to Happosai, rather than let them die they were sent back in time thanks to Ranma's wish for another chance. Both retain their memories and feelings they accumulated; now they have to survive. After going off on a training trip, Ranma and Akane come home to learn their parents tried to change the engagement to a Kuno/Akane, Ranma/Nabiki engagement. This situation was caused by Nabiki who wants Ranma for herself and Genma who has taken a dislike to Akane. For some reason, the marriage contract actually engaged Kuno to Nabiki. Genma tries to steal the ring Loki gave Ranma and gets mangled by his son as punishment. Ryoga and his companion are heading for towards Tokyo from the North. Shampoo is camped out West of Tokyo in Osaka. Ranma and Akane were heading for school and about to pass through the school gates.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Furinkan High school, Morning ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Ranma and Akane turned into the schoolyard; for once a truly spectacular sight greeted them.<p>No Kuno. Kuno wasn't there waiting for them. This revelation almost stunned the two into stopping in their tracks. Almost.<p>The two ran into the school and made it to class with a whole two minutes to spare.<p>Ranma and Akane sat at their desks, both happy that they didn't have to stand in the hallway for once.<p>"Ranma, I was wondering something, Nabiki is pretty shrewd and if anything else a business woman, how could she have missed something as big as her name being on the contract instead of mine."<p>Ranma chuckled, "that's quite simple Akane, your name was on the contract."<p>"Then how was it that Nabiki was the one that ended up being the one who is engaged to Kuno and I still have you?"<p>Ranma reached into his sleeve and pulled out a piece of paper. He handed the paper to Akane.<p>Upon inspection, she realized it was the marriage contract from last night.<p>"How come you have this?"<p>"Well, I couldn't exactly let Kuno become your fiancée while I'm your fiancée, now could I?"<p>"Then what was the contract that my father and Kuno signed?"<p>Ranma chuckled again, "oh don't worry, that was a real marriage contract. Pops always carries one on him in case he needs to sell me for some reason. I guess this time it paid off. I just took one from him and then while you made a distraction I switched the contract and wrote in the names Tatewaki Kuno and Nabiki Tendo in all the right places."<p>"How did you do all that so quickly?"<p>"Remember that martial arts calligraphy match I was in, well it helped my penmanship quite a bit, coupled in with a revised Kachyuu Tenshin Amaguriken and I had myself one marriage contract for one Nabiki Tendo and one Tatewaki Kuno.<p>Akane laughed, "Serves her right, I can't believe she'd try to do something like push me off on Kuno. She knows how much I dislike him."<p>"Well Akane, it looks like just for once something is going right for us."<p>Akane stared at her fiancée in shock before hanging her head.<p>"Ranma, you shouldn't have said that. You really shouldn't have said that."<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Well we're finally in Tokyo, I can't figure out how though."<p>"I told you that it was a short cut."<p>"Shut up, you just got lucky for once. It should have taken us two days at least to get from Aomori to Tokyo and yet we're here now after you knocked us off some cliff, it doesn't make sense," Ryoga's companion grumbled.<p>"Hey you were the one who knocked us over the edge of the cliff. You should have let go of the rope that was attached to me," Ryoga yelled<p>"If you hadn't knocked me off we wouldn't have fallen," Ryoga's companion was fuming now.<p>"If you hadn't attacked me in the first place none of this would have happened."<p>"That's because you wouldn't shut up. You had to keep saying Ranma Saotome this, Ranma Saotome that. I know we're looking for him, but could you just SHUT THE HELL UP ABOUT RANMA SAOTOME."<p>Ryoga was about to yell back at his companion when a new voice interrupted them.<p>"Excuse me, but you wouldn't happen to be talking about Ranma Saotome, the son of Genma Saotome would you?"<p>Both boys turned to the voice to see a beautiful woman standing there looking at them, wearing a pristine Kimono. Over her shoulder she had some long object wrapped carefully. She had a kind smile on her face and seemed to radiate femininity and happiness.<p>"Ummm yeah, that's him," Ryoga's companion dumbly replied.<p>Ryoga just nodded.<p>"You don't happen to know where he is would you," the desperation and hope was clearly evident in the woman's voice. Neither boy could bear to disappoint her by not telling.<p>"Yeah we do, he should be in Nerima right now, he's going to school at Furinkan high," Ryoga's companion stated.<p>"If you don't mind me asking miss, why are you looking for someone like Ranma," Ryoga asked.<p>A glint of anger came into the woman's eye at Ryoga's last words, causing both boys to flinch.<p>"I have some business with him and his father, but I haven't seen him in more than ten years. I was wondering could you two please tell me what you know about him?"<p>"Sure I guess."<p>"Ok."<p>Neither boy could bring himself to refuse the woman's gentle yet commanding tone. It was almost like there was a little magic behind her words. She favored them both with a smile.<p>"Thank you, if you'd like we can go and sit down in that café over there and talk." The woman began walking towards the table. Both boys dumbly followed her without thinking.<p>The three sat down at a table in the café, the two boys waiting for the woman to be seated before seating themselves. The woman ordered some tea and snacks for the two boys.<p>"So, why are you after Ranma Saotome?"<p>"I have my own reasons," Ryoga's companion replied, "If it's all the same I'd rather not share them."<p>The woman frowned a little, but seemed to accept his response before turning her gaze to Ryoga.<p>"And why are you after Ranma Saotome?"<p>Ryoga's companion sighed and cast his eyes heavenwards. He knew what was coming.<p>"Ranma Saotome sent me to hell and ruined my life," Ryoga began to rant.<p>His companion was familiar with this rant; Ryoga even muttered this particular rant in his sleep or when they were walking. So he settled down into his seat and sipped his tea as he watched to see what the woman thought of his companion's rant.<p>He wondered why she kept gripping the bundle, which she carried at times during Ryoga's monologue and her face-hardened ever so slightly and her eye occasionally twitched.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Furinkan High School, Lunch ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Hey Nabiki, we'd like to talk to you."<p>Nabiki turned away from her group of underlings and looked at the source of the voice.<p>Her sister and her sister's fiancée were walking towards her; actually it seemed more like Ranma was gliding towards her while Akane was stomping a warpath towards her.<p>Putting on her best business face Nabiki dismissed her underlings and moved to meet the two.<p>"What can I do for you little sister?"<p>"Nabiki, how the hell could you even think about engaging me to Kuno?"<p>"Whatever do you mean Akane, surely I have no idea what you're talking about," Nabiki replied in a cool tone, but shifted to a more dangerous one, "if you hadn't forgotten, I'm the one who is now engaged to the idiot."<p>"You wouldn't be in this situation if you hadn't tried to break me and Ranma up."<p>Nabiki was getting irritated at her sister's words and tone.<p>"Well you're not engaged to him-"<p>Akane's cut her sister off, "No sis, but if I was I would have been stuck with the psycho and be forced into a marriage that I don't want and couldn't possibly enjoy."<p>"Listen sis, you aren't engaged to Kuno, and even if it had been you, do you honestly think I'd have forced you into an engagement with him if there wasn't a way out of it?"<p>"Huh," both Ranma and Akane asked.<p>"In the marriage contract, I made sure to write in a clause at the end which said, 'should either party involved be dissatisfied by or with the engagement they may call off the engagement, effectively nullifying it.'"<p>Both Ranma and Akane gaped at the middle Tendo sister.<p>"What, did you honestly think I wouldn't have covered the different angles?"<p>"That still doesn't excuse you for trying to take Ranma from me. I mean what do you see in him?"<p>"Hey," Ranma began to protest before being cut off by an elbow to the gut.<p>"Shut up baka," Akane whispered before turning back to her sister, "Nabiki, he and I are happy together and we are in love. There is no way you can break us up."<p>Akane turned and marched away from her sister, Ranma in tow behind her.<p>As they walked away Nabiki honestly began to reconsider her plan to get Ranma. Yes the rings were worth a fortune, but that didn't necessarily he had money; maybe he found them or stole them somewhere on his trip. Nabiki also knew Ranma would inherit the dojo with whoever he married, and while Kasumi and Akane would probably have no problem with staying at home and playing housewife, Nabiki on the other hand wanted to go out into the world and make both a name and money for herself.<p>Maybe it wouldn't be the best thing tied down to someone like Ranma, but at the same time she didn't want to be tied down to someone like Kuno either. Well it was about time to break the marriage contract anyway.<p>Nabiki was about to go find Kuno to inform him when an idea struck her;  maybe I can use this to my advantage after all. I mean, I am Kuno-chan's innazuke, let's see what I can get out of him to make me break the engagement.<p>A new idea came to Nabiki, while Ranma might not have money on him, that didn't mean she couldn't use him to make money. First she'd see what he was capable of and then, a little book keeping on fights Ranma might get himself in. There were so many possibilities to make money open to her now.<p>Nabiki chuckled to herself, after all, Nabiki Tendo doesn't giggle, so that only left a little evil chuckling. Several people who heard Nabiki chuckle shivered and decided they should be elsewhere at that moment.<p>Ranma looked over his shoulder and leaned down to whisper into Akane's ear.<p>"Ummm Akane?"<p>Akane stopped and looked back at her fiancée who was looking rather nervous at the moment.<p>"Yes Ranma, what is it?"<p>"Well, you know how I told you that I changed the contracts around?"<p>"Yes, and?"<p>"Well, the standard contract pops used didn't have Nabiki's clause in it. Think we should tell her?"<p>Akane looked back at her older sister and saw her chuckling to herself as people moved away from her.<p>"I think we should let her figure that one out for herself, then maybe she'll be less willing to interfere with us next time around."<p>The two walked off to enjoy their lunch together, leaving their sister/sister-in-law to her own devices.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"I can't believe Ranma ran away from our fight, thanks to him I've seen hell. How cowardly can a person be? He's a pathetic excuse for even a coward. He-"<p>"So my son has behaved in a most unmanly way has he," the woman asked startling both boys.<p>Ryoga stopped in his rant at hearing the word 'son'.<p>His companion sat upright from where he had been drifting in and out of sleep. A person can only hear a rant so many times before it gets old. As soon the woman said son he was wide-awake and paying attention<p>"What do you mean son?"<p>"I am Nodoka Saotome, mother of Ranma Saotome and wife of Genma Saotome."<p>Neither boy knew what to say to that particular piece of information. For the past god only knows how long Ryoga had been sitting there insulting and degrading Ranma and it seemed that he had been degrading none other than Ranma's own mother.<p>"Where is Ranma right now," Nodoka's voice was still calm and polite, but there was a new dangerous undertone to her voice.<p>Ryoga's companion took over talking, giving Ryoga a chance to sip some tea and cool down.<p>"As far as we know, Ranma is in the Nerima ward of Tokyo, going to school at a place called Furinkan High. We were in the process of tracking him down."<p>"You still haven't explained why you are after my son."<p>"I have my own reasons which I don't really feel like sharing with anyone but Ranma. Believe me though; it's a good reason."<p>"Very well, thank you for talking to me gentlemen, however disheartening it has been, I thank you for your time," the Saotome matriarch stood up and bowed to the two boys who stood up and returned her bow.<p>Mrs. Saotome paid for their repast and turned to leave.<p>"Excuse me ma'am if you don't mind me asking, where are you going to now that you know where your son is," Ryoga's companion asked.<p>Nodoka stopped and stood still for a moment before turning around to face the two she had talked to. Both boys noticed tears that she was withholding in her eyes.<p>"I'm going to Nerima, and I fear I go to end the Saotome line."<p>Leaving the two boys shocked into immobility Nodoka walked down the street away from the two and towards Nerima.<p>"Somehow I think she took what you said badly," Ryoga's companion stated as soon as he regained the proper state of mind to do so, after the woman was out of sight.<p>Ryoga could only nod in reply.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Furinkan High School, Afternoon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Thank god that's over," Ranma muttered.<p>We join our two main characters as they pack their bags to head home from school. The two are leaving the building at the moment, talking.<p>School had been almost normal. Ranma and Akane had almost gone through a normal day of school that other teenagers all over the country went through . . . Almost.<p>During lunch a crowd of girls had crowded around Akane cooing over her ring, telling her how lucky she was to have a hunk like Ranma as a fiancée, asking her what he's like, and causing a general nuisance for the most wanted girl in school.<p>The guys had crowded round the new guy who had come out of nowhere, stealing the most wanted girl in school, beating the school's champion, and disrupting the abnormal swing of things at Furinkan. Of course, years later the students without a single dissenting opinion would all agree that things were actually normal before the arrival of the pigtailed martial artist.<p>They had asked less polite questions than the girls. Usually something along the lines of; how far have you gotten, what's she like in bed, have you *&amp;#$ed her, and even less polite questions than that. Ranma's only reprieve came in the form of Hiroshi and Daisuke who helped Ranma get rid of the worst of the crowd. Afterwards they proceeded to have a pretty decent conversation where Daisuke and Hiroshi avoided mentioning Akane for the most part and mostly asked Ranma questions about himself. Ranma had thanked them and the three had proceeded to their physical education period.<p>Ranma had demonstrated his physical prowess in gymnastics, impressing his class. Unfortunately the girls chose that day to play softball and Ranma had the misfortune of being distracted while watching Akane when she was up to bat. As a consequence of his inattention, he received a softball in the face.<p>That's why they were leaving at current, Akane walking Ranma to the clinic at their teacher's behest. To make sure Ranma made it to Dr. Tofu's ok and without collapsing.<p>"Ya know, this all seems very familiar to me for some reason, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why."<p>Akane looked thoroughly dejected.<p>"I said I was sorry Ranma," Akane's tone was gloomy. How the hell did I hit him, I wasn't even aiming for him. Why did this have to happen again?<p>Ranma looked over at Akane, she really did seem repentant about hitting him with the softball. The fact that she was walking on Ranma's left and capable of seeing the results of her handiwork weren't helping either.<p>"Don't worry about it Akane, it's not like you killed me or nothing."<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before he regretted phrasing his sentence that way. Tears began to well up in Akane's eyes at the mention of Ranma dieing.<p>"Ahh, geez Akane, I didn't mean it that way, what I meant was I'm fine, it will take a lot more than a little softball to cause me trouble."<p>"Well I guess that's why," Akane mumbled still looking miserable.<p>"Why what Akane?"<p>"Why I hit you, with a head that big I'd have more trouble hitting the broadside of a barn," Akane's eyes still had tears in them, but at least she was now wearing the ghost of a smile.<p>"Yeah that's-HEY, what do you mean by that?"<p>Akane laughed and took off running for the clinic, Ranma following behind her, not trying to catch her, but not losing any ground either.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Northwestern edge of Nerima, Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Thank god we made it, after you took off away from Tokyo I thought we were going to spend another week trudging around Japan till we got back here."<p>The two came out of the woods overlooking Nerima. After the woman calling herself Nodoka Saotome had left their sight, Ryoga took off after her, managing to get the pair out of Tokyo in a surprisingly short amount of time. Thankfully his companion had taken off after him and stopped Ryoga before he succeeded in leaving the country.<p>"Finally we've arrived in Nerima. Now Ranma you will suffer for all you've put me through."<p>Ryoga bent down and picked up a rock.<p>"Ranma, I will crush you as easily as I crush this rock."<p>Ryoga squeezed the rock into gravel while laughing maniacally.<p>"Umm Ryoga, you might not want to stand there," his companion tried to point out the sign that Ryoga had clearly ignored. It wasn't a very important sign . . .<p>"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH," but since the rock Ryoga was standing on gave out and he was currently rolling down the slope he had so recently been standing on.<p>"Never mind, at least he didn't blame Ranma for that one."<p>A weak voice came from the bottom of the slope, "Ranma, I'll get you for making my life hell."<p>"Damn, looks like I spoke to soon."<p>Ryoga's companion began to pick his way down to where Ryoga lay. Ryoga for his part was lying under some rocks cursing Ranma, himself, Ranma, the gods, Ranma, his sense of direction, Ranma, the ground, Ranma, Ranma, and Ranma.<p>"Don't worry Ryoga, I'm coming," as he spoke and made his way down the slope towards his directionless companion, preparing a new coil of rope as a leash while he went.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dr. Tofu's clinic, Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>Tofu greeted Ranma and Akane as they entered the clinic.<p>"Ahhh, Akane-chan, Ranma-kun, how are you doing today, that looks like a nasty mark on your face. Mind if I take a look at it?"<p>Tofu escorted the two into his examination room where he took off the bandage on Ranma's cheek.<p>"That's quite a bruise Ranma, looks like Akane's handiwork."<p>"I'm sure it was an accident Dr. Tofu, I'm sure she didn't really mean to do it," Ranma quickly replied while watching Akane who was intently watching the floor tiles shamefaced.<p>Tofu seemed to pick up on Akane's mood, which wasn't very difficult as she was almost generating an aura of despair in her current state. He turned to face her while letting Ranma apply the cream Tofu had given him. The boy seemed very familiar with the process of treating his own wounds as he did it quite well.<p>"Akane were you really the one who hit Ranma with the softball. I was only joking."<p>Tears slid down Akane's cheeks as she threw her arms around the doctor.<p>"I hurt him Doctor, I keep hurting him."<p>Tofu patted the crying girl on her back. Not that he'd admit it to her, but she had gotten exceedingly lucky that she hit Ranma and not someone else. The sheer power that was behind the softball would have probably dislocated if not broken a normal person's jaw and knocked out quite a few teeth. This Ranma had to be something special to have nothing more than a bruise from the strike.<p>"Shhh Akane, don't cry, I'm fine, you don't keep hurting me, I just don't know when to duck, how else do you think you got me with that damned mallet all the time. I'm tough enough to take whatever you give me. Don't cry. You know as well as I do that nothing's going to stop me," Tofu was shocked to hear the kind words from the pigtailed boy, as it was Tofu was trying to come up with words of his own to comfort Akane.<p>Maybe he's good with saying the right words at the right times, Tofu thought as Akane separated from him and went over to her fiancée's open arms. Ranma made soothing sounds as he held Akane, rocking gently.<p>"After all, a tomboy like you has nothing on someone like me," Ranma joked. Unfortunately he chose a poor time to exercise his less than impeccable sense of humour.<p>"RANMA NO BAKA," Akane yelled as she judo tossed Ranma into the clinic wall, shaking the clinic, putting cracks in the wall, and silencing a foolish pigtailed martial artist.<p>Or maybe I could be mistaken, Tofu rethought as he went over to check on his patient, again.<p>Surprisingly Ranma was on his feet before Tofu even reached where he lay.<p>"Gomen Akane, Gomen," Ranma even though he felt like screaming 'what did you do that for you kawaii (he hadn't been able to refer to Akane as kawaiikune since she kissed him in the bath) tomboy', he didn't although it had been a long and difficult process; he had managed to gain minor control over his mouth. This control was very fragile and failed quite frequently, but for some reason it managed to work just often enough to keep Ranma alive.<p>"I'm sorry too Ranma, I shouldn't have thrown you across the room."<p>Tofu watched the pigtailed boy pick walk over to his fiancée. He shouldn't be able to do that; he should barely be able to walk.<p>Ranma wrapped his arms around his fiancée who wrapped her arms around him. He shouldn't be able to do that either, at least one of Ranma's arms should be dislocated if not broken.<p>Ranma bent his head to put a kiss on Akane's forehead. He definitely shouldn't be able to do that, that boy should have a concussion from the force of Akane's throw.<p>Tofu was brought out of his contemplation by Ranma's voice.<p>"Thanks for the cream Doc," Ranma called to the Dr. as he and Akane began to walk out the door.<p>"You really should come over to the dojo some time, I'm sure we'd all be happy to have you," Akane said as she gripped Ranma's arm.<p>Tofu was able to collect his thoughts in time to call out his own goodbye before the two disappeared.<p>With the two marital artists gone Tofu turned to look at where his most recent patient had been sitting.<p>This is definitely going to require some thought, I'm going to have to watch this Ranma Saotome, and I have a feeling that things are going to be getting a lot more interesting around Nerima.<p>"Well looks like I'm going to have to spend some serious thought on the issue," Tofu stated out loud.<p>"Hello, is anyone here?" A gentle, soft, caring voice drifted in from the waiting room.<p>Tofu's glasses fogged up and all rational thought fled his mind as he turned around.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Nerima, Tokyo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"You, where's Furinkan High School," Ryoga barked out, grabbing a boy wearing a school uniform who was passing by him.<p>"Umm, turn your head to the left Ryoga," Ryoga's companion said with a sigh.<p>Ryoga turned his head to look, "what, I don't see anything?"<p>Ryoga's companion reached over and turned Ryoga's head so he was looking left rather than right.<p>"Furinkan High School," Ryoga read out loud looking at the sign on the wall.<p>"Yes, finally Ranma, I will have my revenge for what you've put me through."<p>"You mean hell," his companion helpfully stated.<p>"Yes actually, RANMA SAOTOME BECAUSE OF YOU I'VE SEEN HELL."<p>"Umm, I hate to interrupt, I really do, but would you mind letting me go," asked Daisuke staring fearfully at the two people in front of him.<p>Unfortunately by talking Daisuke brought Ryoga's attention back to himself.<p>"Where is Ranma Saotome," Ryoga growled.<p>"He and his fiancée went home earlier today."<p>"That coward, running away from his punishment."<p>"Ryoga, does he even know you're chasing him?"<p>"No, but that still doesn't mean he can run away from me."<p>Ryoga's companion put his head in his hands and groaned.<p>Daisuke was merely staring in horror at the monster in front of him who just put his fist through a brick wall. He began saying a silent prayer to any kami that would listen.<p>"Listen Ryoga, why don't you just put that guy down and we can find somewhere to stay tonight. Then we can just see Ranma tomorrow when he shows up," Ryoga's companion calmly stated, while inside he was fuming at this turn of events, You've spent this long searching for him, another day won't be too much to ask now will it?<p>"Grrrrrrrrrrr."<p>"I said why don't you put him down, I don't imagine he's enjoying you holding his shirt like that."<p>Ryoga forced his grip to loosen on the shirt until the boy could worm his way out of Ryoga's vice grip. Daisuke sighed in relief and turned to leave, only to find a hand on his shoulder impeding his progress. He tried to ignore the hand and keep going, but the hand's grip didn't waver.<p>Daisuke turned back to face his tormentor and found that this time it wasn't the oni wearing the black and yellow bandana that was restraining him, but the oni's companion.<p>"Yes, can I help you," Daisuke was able to bring himself to ask, regretting his words the moment he said them. The evil grin his new tormentor was wearing didn't help his feelings of dread one iota.<p>"As a matter of fact, yes, I'd like to talk with you for a little while, if that's ok with you?"<p>Daisuke managed a slight whimper before the two demons that were obviously sent to torture him dragged the unfortunate boy off towards his doom.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tendo home, Nerima ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>It was a mostly normal evening at the Tendo residence. The type of normal where the majority of the world is used to, sitting around relaxing like the everyday normal family does. Not the normal for the Tendo dojo which usually consists of something life-threatening, magical, mystical, mysterious, strange, and always property damaging.<p>Mostly meaning that most families don't have a huge panda playing Shogi with a hyper-emotional man who happens to be a martial arts master, three girls each skilled in their own particular arts who are putting those arts to good use, and an aqua-transsexual currently male pigtailed martial artists who was doing a fair imitation of a bouncy rubber ball with the way he/she was flying around the family dojo.<p>* RING, RING, RING *<p>"Hello, Tendo Dojo," Akane answered the phone as she was the one closest to it.<p>She listened to the other voice for a few moments as the other party went through proper introductions.<p>"Oh, hello Daisuke, how are you?"<p>"WHAT? WHO DID WHAT," Akane screamed into the phone, attracting the attention of the rest of the house and bringing Ranma in from the Dojo. A whimper could be heard from the phone as Daisuke expressed the pain Akane's not so quiet words caused. Even the plastic of the phone's receiver squeaked slightly as Akane's grip intensified.<p>"Ok, so they were looking for Ranma?"<p>Akane's eyes caught Ranma's as she spoke into the phone.<p>"An Oni? With fangs and a yellow and black polka dot bandanna?"<p>Ranma frowned slightly and Akane nodded, causing Ranma to frown even more.<p>"What, there were two of them, can you describe the other one?"<p>Ranma's eyes opened wider in surprise at this piece of news, as did Akane's. The rest of the family was just sitting there listening to the half of the conversation, which they were able to.<p>"Evil eyes, ok, anything else you remember, no, just the evil eyes? What colour were they? EVIL ISN'T A COLOUR." Akane yelled into the receiver causing all listening to wince at the volume of her tone.<p>I hope Daisuke doesn't go deaf, Ranma thought, but wisely kept his mouth shut.<p>"Are you ok? Good, what did they ask you?"<p>Akane listened to the phone for a while as Daisuke explained what had happened.<p>"Anything else? No, ok. Don't worry I'll tell Ranma. Yeah don't worry; we'll get them back for you. Bye Daisuke, yes I'm sure you can talk to him tomorrow."<p>Akane slammed the receiver down loud enough to make everyone but Ranma wince.<p>"Ranma, we need to talk," Akane said glancing at her fiancée.<p>"Yeah I think we do," Ranma replied, a grave look on his face.<p>Akane led Ranma upstairs to her room. Leaving the rest of their family downstairs, puzzling over what the phone call could have been about.<p>A few moments later the family gave a mutual shrug and returned to what they were doing before Akane's not so quiet voice had interrupted them. Everyone that is, but Nabiki who waited to hear her little sister's door slam shut. An evil grin spread on her face as she heard the door shut.<p>"So what did Daisuke want," Ranma asked after Akane closed the door to her room.<p>"Ryoga's here," Akane simply stated.<p>The two went and sat down on Akane's bed, Ranma leaned his back against the wall and opened his arms. Akane sat beside him and leaned into his arms, resting her head upon his chest.<p>"Well at least he's on time for once," Akane joked.<p>"Yeah, but what about the person with him?"<p>"I'm not sure, Daisuke said it was a guy with an evil glint in his eyes."<p>"That really doesn't help much, with our history of Jusenkyo, magic, and transvestites there's no telling what sex whoever it is could be," Ranma was only half-joking. After Herb, Ukyo, Tsubasa, Konatsu, and others Ranma was always careful to try and find out the sex of his opponent before he fought them.<p>"The evil glint doesn't help much either, all it tells us is the person has two eyes," Akane added in her own joke trying to lighten the mood which was getting heavier by the moment.<p>"I hope I don't have to deal with Ryoga as an enemy this time around."<p>"How are you going to make him give up his quest for vengeance? He was pretty hell-bent on getting revenge right up until the end last time round."<p>"I don't know how, all I know is that I don't want him as an enemy."<p>"What's the best way to get rid of him as an enemy then?"<p>"We take Sun Tzu's advice on how to eradicate an enemy."<p>Akane quirked an eyebrow and looked back at Ranma curiously, she never knew he read anything without being forced.<p>"And how would that be Ranma?"<p>"Simple, make the enemy into an ally."<p>"And how are you going to do that?"<p>"I don't know, I'm hoping to come up with something by lunch tomorrow at the latest, but preferably before we get to school in the first place."<p>"Why lunch?"<p>"If this person Ryoga has is leading him around and helping him, I'm not so confident that he'll arrive as school lets out like last time. There are so many changes that will happen and are happening this time around I want to try and be prepared for whatever comes."<p>"That's impossible Ranma, there's no way we could have known Ryoga would meet someone this time round that would help him."<p>"That's not it Akane, the point is we actually haven't interacted with Ryoga yet, nothing should be different about him this time. If this was going according to the proper timeline then Ryoga should arrive tomorrow alone as we're leaving Furinkan and attack me from above like he did last time," Ranma was obviously getting frustrated.<p>Akane turned and planted a kiss on his lips to keep him from saying anything else. After a couple minutes of kissing, Ranma had relaxed.<p>"Thanks Akane, I needed that."<p>Akane giggled, "well it was either kiss you or slap you and since I've already done hit you with a softball and thrown you into a wall, I thought it was past time for a kiss."<p>Ranma sighed, "thanks, but you know what they say, bad stuff comes in threes, maybe it would have been better if you had slapped me then whatever came next wouldn't be as bad."<p>"You actually believe in that old wives tale," Akane asked giving Ranma an incredulous look.<p>"If you live my life, you learn to believe in those type of thi-OUCH," Ranma blurted out as he felt something hit his head.<p>Akane giggled and tossed her mini-mallet away.<p>"What was that for?"<p>"Well since you believe bad stuff comes in threes then I decided to let you off with a little tap from my mallet."<p>Ranma nodded grudgingly while chuckling, "yeah, I guess that mallet of yours would round everything out after all. Now how are you going to make it up to me for hitting me all those times?"<p>"Well I have a few ideas on the subject at hand," Akane cupped Ranma's face with her hands, "or in this case the subject in hand."<p>She pulled Ranma close and the two shared a passionate kiss.<p>An hour or so latter Ranma returned to his own room to get a good night's sleep for what looked to be a busy day tomorrow.<p>As he went back to his room he never noticed Nabiki slipping back into her room.<p>Now, who is this Ryoga exactly and how much of his story is similar to Ranma and little sister's story.<p>Nabiki Tendo, the Ice Queen of Furinkan High School vowed to herself to get to the bottom of this mess and find out what was really going on with her little sister and her little sister's fiancée.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Somewhere Else ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>"Nabiki could prove to be either a hindrance or an asset," the armoured figure mused aloud.<p>"Yes she could, but the problem is deciding which one she could possibly be. Nabiki is a truly impressive person; there are few people out there as self-serving as she is. We're just fortunate that she has given up trying to get the godslayer for her own," the cloaked figure replied with what might have been a smirk.<p>"Yes, that is quite fortunate for all involved, but she still bears way to much interest in those two than is healthy."<p>"Well what did you expect? She is Nabiki Tendo; she is probably one of the two beings who meddle in the godslayer's life more than Loki."<p>"I don't think anyone would be able to meddle in the godslayer's life than that old fool. After all he's had sixteen years to freely meddle in his life without anyone but the occasional act of god to keep the godslayer alive and sane," the armoured figure's tone bore quite a bit of anger within it.<p>"That's true, but that is the past, it would be best to turn our gaze forward towards the upcoming events. Tomorrow will be a busy day for the godslayer. He has quite a lot to prepare for and that's just his rivals, who knows what he'll have to deal with from his supposed allies. Things are progressing very quickly."<p>"Too quickly if you ask me, I can't believe Ryoga ran into Nodoka Saotome, she wasn't meant to come into the picture for quite some time yet."<p>"And whose fault is that, it was due to you redirecting Ryoga that he ran into the other two. Now we have to deal with those two ahead of time, there is no way to predict what effect this will have on the timeline."<p>"We could always try to go back in time and give Ryoga another nudge to see if he goes the right direction this time."<p>"That would be a very bad idea. Any attempt at time travel would be noted by the others and it would bring unwanted attention on us, besides there's no guarantee that things would be better off with Ryoga going a different direction, there's no telling who or what he might run into.<p>"You're right, besides, the reader's would kill the author if the last six chapters were all suddenly meaningless and he delayed the plot by sending them back on another five chapter training trip."<p>"Yes I believe you're right and I'd rather not fade out of existence with no author to write me in."<p>The armoured figure shrugged its shoulders, "I'm sure things will turn out adequately in the end."<p>"How can you be so positive about that?"<p>"Simple, I still have an ace up my sleeve that I haven't played yet."<p>The armoured figure began laughing.<p>The cloaked figure really wasn't in the mood to laugh due to the sheer number of times the chapters have ended with them laughing and went back to watching the events unfold.<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ End of chapter 13, TBC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>An: Well that's another chapter of the story done.<p>One of the readers had a strong objection to Nabiki and the contract she set up between Akane and Kuno. He has said that he won't be reading any more of this story due to the fact Nabiki wouldn't force her sister like that. If he is bothering to continue reading into this chapter he would have learnt that Nabiki put in a clause where her sister could escape from the engagement. This leads me to one suggestion to other readers; never assume you know what I am going to write. I love mysteries, foreshadowing, and generally confusing people by leaving unanswered questions, which I will eventually answer.<p>If anyone has any comments on the story I would love to hear about them, advice and compliments are also welcome. In case anyone wonders, I read all the reviews I get about the story and if requested I am more than willing to respond or communicate with anyone so interested. If you do send an e- mail to me please put 'one last chance' or 'fan fiction' in the title if you want me to read it promptly otherwise I might accidentally skip over it.<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter, if you want to contact me and have me respond, E-mail me at  and I'll try to get back in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks.<p>-Rhuobhe26
