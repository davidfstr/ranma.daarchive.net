</div><p style="text-align:center;">Oyu no Ranma</p><p>A Ranma ½ fanfic by Zorknot</p><p>Chapter 2: Oyu no Genma</p><p>DISCLAIMER: I do not own Ranma1/2. This fic is based on the comics by Rumiko Takahashi (published by Viz Comics) and on the TV anime series produced by Hidenori Taga and directed by Tomomitsu Mochizuki with music by Eiji Mori and character design by Atsuko Nakajima. The director of photography for the series was Mitsunobu Yoshida, and it was produced by Fuji TV and Kitty Film. The executive producer for the Viz Video release of the series was Seiji Horibuchi, the production coordinators were Toshifume Yoshida who translated and Trish Ledoux, who also wrote the English screenplay and lyrics. These people shall heretofore be referred to as "The army of the undead"</p><p>WHAT HAS COME BEFORE: Ranma heard Akane before she opened the door on him in the bath and drank a potion that locked him in girl form. They took a bath together, Nabiki took some pictures, one thing led to another and now Genma is supposed to train the Tendo daughters in Anything Goes, Ranma is supposed to teach Akane how to cook among other things, and Akane is supposed to teach Ranma to be more of a girl. Later, Soun will dive fourteen stories into a tiny glass of water...</p><p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~</p><p>The men at the public bathhouse are silent as they watch a panda walk alongside a man with shoulder length black hair and an impressive mustache. The few who continue to talk join the others in astonishment as they see the panda, after stepping into the bath, turn almost instantly into a bald man of stout stature and serious demeanor.</p><p>"I really wish you would stop practicing that MAGIC TRICK, Saotome," the mustachioed man admonishes his companion loudly while handing him some low-tech sports glasses. "It never fails to attract UNWANTED attention."</p><p>The stout, bald, man takes the glasses and shoves his ears through the wire loops of the earpieces. He remains silent as he takes the extra towel that his friend is carrying and wraps it around his waist. Then he takes a bandana and ties it on his head. Finally, sitting down in the hot water, he speaks through a sigh as his friend joins him. "I know, Tendo, but I just can't help myself."</p><p>The other men at the bath hold various expressions of confusion, amazement, and mirth and then start talking again, returning the gurgling of background conversation back to its previous levels.</p><p>The two men are, of course, Tendo Soun and Saotome Genma. They are here because the hot water at the Tendo home is out, and Kasumi is using the range to cook supper. Rather than build another fire out in the backyard, they both opted to enjoy themselves in this modest, yet well run establishment. The reason why they, and in particular, Genma are seeking hot water is that Ranma, tired of Genma's lecturing, doused Genma with a bucket of water, turning him into a panda. Since nothing in the evolutionary history of pandas equipped the animals for giving passionate lectures on the finer points of the Art, Genma had to end his talk a little early. And he still has one or two things to say to his son turned daughter.</p><p>Genma tries to think. Where exactly did he go wrong? Was it leaving Nodoka? Was it the training...the Nekoken? Or does Ranma's rebelliousness stem from Jusenkyo? Could it be...that the boy really is turning into a girl? What if that blasted potion made the curse permanent? Genma shakes his head free of these fears. I must focus, he cautions himself, a martial artist must deal only in the now, not in the to be or has been...</p><p>"You know," Soun speaks, interrupting Genma's chain of thought, "I'm really a terrible father."</p><p>Genma turns his head in surprise: "Don't be ridiculous, Tendo! Your daughters are fine young women!"</p><p>"I know, Saotome. It amazes me everyday. I swear that every bit of good that they have in them must have come from..." Soun trails off as his eyes mist over, "but she was...in their lives such a short time. So short..." Soun starts weeping freely.</p><p>Genma places a firm calloused hand on his friend's shoulder. "Tendo, I was there last night. You handled that situation admirably. I don't know what I would have done... If any of us is a bad father...it's me."</p><p>Soun wipes the tears from his eyes with the back of his hand. "Saotome, you've gone through a lot. It can't have been easy to be a father while dealing with a strange curse." Soun splashes his face with the bath water and sighs. "I suppose it's pointless worrying about whether we're good fathers or not...it would be great if it were like the Art, where you can practice...and learn...and become better, and be good or bad, but parenthood... It's a tough lesson for me, but I'm learning...it's not at all the same thing."</p><p>Genma releases Soun's shoulder and rubs his forehead and temples slowly, "I know what you mean, Tendo. I tried to raise Ranma differently from how the Master raised us..." Genma lifts his hand from his head and gazes at the lines in his palm, "but I ended up just doing the same things. I tried to train Ranma to be the best. I wanted the big prize. I wanted to win the parent game." Genma's hand becomes a fist, "Tendo, my friend, I can't help feeling that I failed." The hand drops into the water with a splash and Genma looks away.</p><p>"Mm hm. Mm hm," Soun nods sagely, "I felt exactly the same way when Kasumi was Ranma's age."</p><p>"But, Tendo! Kasumi is a marvelous young woman!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, but then, so is Ranma." Genma winces painfully, Soun continues, "We don't see the good things do we, Saotome? We only see the things that need improvement- the weaknesses that must become strengths...meanwhile our children have lives of their own, problems that we never had to deal with." Soun locks eyes with Genma "Kasumi was going to be the heir to the school."</p><p>Genma sinks deeper into the water. "I see."</p><p>Soun nods, "For seven years after... For seven years I barely practiced the Art at all. I would do some basic katas, meditate...but not much else. On Kasumi's sixteenth birthday I realized that if I wanted the school to continue, I had to train my daughters. But it was too late." Soun is silent for a moment as he looks at the men's locker room forlornly. Then he turns back around and settles against the wall of the public bath. "I need a cigarette."</p><p>"Nasty habit," Genma says idly, a little shocked. It is in truth one of the worst habits for a martial artist to get into, air being so essential to the Art. The Master found a way around it, but then he found a way around everything. He'll probably find a way around the three-meter thick wall of rock that Genma and Soun imprisoned him in. The thought makes Genma shiver, even in the steaming water.</p><p>Soun gives Genma a sad smile. "I know. It was either smoking or razor blades. I figured smoking would be easier on the kids." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't be so morbid. It's not that bad now. Now it mostly just helps me forget... You know what she said to me? My eldest daughter?"</p><p>Genma shakes his head though he has a pretty good idea.</p><p>"She told me that the Art was too violent, and that it was useless and that she wanted no part in it. My life! And she dismisses it as some cruel boyish game. I was devastated! Then Nabiki, at fourteen, asks me why she couldn't just carry a loaded gun instead! Only Akane was interested in training again, and I think she only wanted to please me. Now she has this 'I hate boys' thing stuck in her head. Saotome, old friend, I don't think a single one of them understands. That's all I'm asking you to do. Make them understand."</p><p>Genma shakes his head again "Tendo, I have been trying to get Ranma to do that for ten years. The boy still sees it mostly as a way to show off."</p><p>One of Soun's black eyebrows arches up. "The boy...Saotome, what really happened to Ranma? Why doesn't she...he change like you?"</p><p>Genma sighs, "He drank some damn fool potion in the furo right after we got here. He says it might even be permanent. I think being a girl for awhile might be good for him. Knock his cockiness down a bit anyway. But I don't think I could handle Ranma being my... daughter forever. I wish we could go home, but Nodoka...she let us leave only under some...severe... conditions. She was out of her mind when I left her, and I'm not sure how much better she is now."</p><p>"Yes," Soun nodded. "I think in her own way she loved her as much as I did."</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>Genma remembers the night Nodoka went insane. She had gotten a letter...or maybe it was something in the newspaper or a magazine...whatever it was, it pushed her over the edge. She started screaming that Ranma was a man... that "they" couldn't take Ranma away. That "they" had no right. When Genma asked who "they" were Nodoka yelled "Help. HELP!" Genma embraced her and said he was trying to help, but she was hysterical and adrenaline pumping through her, she threw Genma to the ground and screamed "You don't understand!" Then she ran to the dojo and got out the sword. She was going to kill Ranma rather than allow him to be taken. Luckily Genma stopped her in time.</p><p>After Genma wrenched the sword from her grasp, she ran screaming into the boy's room. She started packing things into a back pack. "Why are you doing this?" Genma remembers asking.</p><p>"Take, him, Genma Leave! Go! Don't let them get him! You must make him a man! More than a man...a man's man, a man among men! Maybe they won't find him then. Maybe he'll be safe. But you have to promise me! In writing! You got to promise..."</p><p>She went on like that until finally, exasperated, Genma wrote up the contract, and signed it. Ranma, of course, didn't know that the hand prints he patted on the paper would resign him to ten years on the road. At five, he still thought his Dad knew everything and that Mom knew more.</p><p>That night was the last Genma saw of Nodoka.</p><p>It was only a few days after the death of Kimiko, the woman who was Soun's wife and Nodoka's best friend.</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>"So many terrible things happened that year," Genma says above the echo of Nodoka's screams "what is the English expression? 'When it rains, it pours?'"</p><p>"Mmm hmm. Tragedies never happen when you want them to...She was so perfect, Saotome. She was a lot of things for a lot of people...but she was everything to me."</p><p>Genma looked down through the steaming water to the tiled floor of the bath. "I wish I knew her better before..."</p><p>"She was amazing, Saotome. She could do anything...and she did! And she did it with a smile and a carefree attitude. It's odd, but Ranma reminds me of her a little bit..."</p><p>Genma finds himself imagining Ranma grown up and a woman. He doesn't like it. Still even as he pushes the picture away disgustedly, he can almost see now why Soun and Nodoka were so affected when Kimiko passed. There's something about Ranma...some spark of life that persisted even through Genma's many mistakes, and Genma made quite a few... "You know I still have a weakness for food, Tendo. I never got over it. I know a lot of it was the master's fault, but still, it's no excuse for what I did."</p><p>"What did you do, my friend?" Soun asks, relieved for the change in subject but still grim.</p><p>"I..." Genma falters. He realizes that Soun won't take the information he is about to reveal well. However, seeing as the engagement is thrown into doubt now anyway, he decides to continue. "I sold Ranma. Countless times. For food. For FOOD! I engaged him to so many girls...and even one or two boys..."</p><p>Soun's expression darkens for a bit, but then his features relax into weary sadness. "It's okay, my friend...I know how you get when you're hungry. You had to do it or someone might have died..."</p><p>Genma remembers the master's training...</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>"In order to progress in the Art," the old, lecherous midget had said blowing smoke rings from his pipe into the air, "you must find your weakness. You must come to terms with the thing that could bring you down unequivocally. You must find this, and make it your strength. Do you know your weakness, Genma my boy?"</p><p>"Food?" Genma, Ranma's age at the time, had answered.</p><p>"Yes. Do you know how we're going to make it you're strength?"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>Happosai cackled evilly, "You're going on a diet, pudge boy!"</p><p>For four long years the demonic old man made Genma train and fast. He dangled a roasted chicken just out of Genma's reach, making Genma fight him for it, only he would never let Genma near it and would later eat it himself with exaggerated gusto. Whenever Genma passed out, and he did often, Happosai would toss him over a cliff into the icy waters of the Pacific. Soun would have to fish him out then usually, something he hated to do, because there were whales in the ocean...</p><p>After the first month, Genma began stealing food. He developed the Umisenken almost accidentally from trying to sneak past Happosai. The first time he had managed it, Genma was so surprised he made it past the unearthly munchkin he almost blew it. Once he realized he had found a technique he developed it and the Yamasenken in secret, over a period of three years. Genma was sure that Happosai would figure out the technique if he performed it too many times; so he only saved it for a last resort. It was therefore not enough to keep the training from affecting him.</p><p>One night Genma had managed to sneak past Happosai and into a small town. He broke into a modest marketplace and was picking out what he was going to eat when the owner, an Asagiri Genji, confronted him. With a shotgun. Something clicked just then...something other than the re-chambering of the shotgun, though it was just as ominous.</p><p>Genma still doesn't remember what happened. He woke up in a jail cell covered in dried blood. It was not his own. He was aware of a familiar metallic taste on his tongue...</p><p>It wasn't the first time Genma had had a blackout. He was so malnourished after the first year that there'd be many times his memory completely failed him and he had no idea what he had been doing. Often this happened during training, or when he was running or basically doing anything he didn't have the energy for. He never wound up in quite this situation though.</p><p>Happosai came with Soun shortly after Genma woke up. The midget had a wide smile on his face. Soun's face, by contrast, was ashen, and he seemed almost scared of his long time friend. "You did it, boy!" Happosai exclaimed, "You learned a new technique! Now I can stop watching your sorry ass all the time!"</p><p>Genma stiffened. He thought Happosai had found out about the Umisenken and Yamasenken. "Wh- what do you mean?" Genma was still a little groggy and, he was just realizing, his stomach was upset. A wicked gurgling illustrated this last fact further. His stomach wasn't just upset, it was furious.</p><p>"You're a fool if you don't know what I'm talking about," the master declared. The white metal bars rolled to the side and Genma shuffled out holding his stomach. There were some forms that had to be signed that Genma was dimly aware of, some questions which he answered without much thought, and then he was outside, the noonday sun blinding after the fluorescent pallor of the jail.</p><p>Happosai bounced off ahead of Genma and Soun. Soun picked his pace up making Genma walk faster to keep up with him, something his stomach didn't like one bit. Finally he couldn't take it. He grabbed Soun's shoulder. He could feel Soun stiffen. When he turned around his eyes were wide. "What happened, Tendo?" Genma asked.</p><p>"You... that man..." Soun was eighteen then, almost a year younger than Genma. He didn't have a mustache, just a thin layer of stubble. His hair was in a simple ponytail instead of falling to his shoulders regally the way it does now. His muscles and gracefulness barely saved him from looking like an awkward, gangly teen. When he spoke to Genma then, he looked even younger. He was at that moment a small boy, on the verge of tears, who had just seen something truly terrible.</p><p>He had seen the writhing, twisted body of Asagiri Genji. Three ribs were fractured, one of them poking through the man's lung. The left forearm was broken in a greenstick fracture, one of the bones protruding out of the skin. The left leg didn't have a foot so much as a battered mush. The right leg was bent the wrong way, the kneecap shattered. As for the right arm it was obscenely dislocated and...a huge chunk was bitten out of it.</p><p>It was sitting in Genma's stomach.</p><p>When Soun saw Genji, the paramedics were trying to figure out how to remove the shotgun wrapped around the man's neck.</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>Back in the public bath, Genma shakes his head. "You know it never happened again. In all this time...not once."</p><p>"Saotome... would you really want to risk it? Especially with your child with you?"</p><p>"No...and I'd like to think that was why I sold Ranma. To get him away from me while I found something to eat, but when I get hungry...Tendo I just don't think about anyone but myself."</p><p>Soun nods. After an uncomfortable silence Soun straightens up and takes a breath. "So...how's the training going?"</p><p>Genma smiled slightly, "I forgot just how much fun being a sensei could be..."</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>That morning after breakfast, Genma prepared Ranma's book bag for school, which is to say he put paper and pencils in it along with a book of martial arts techniques. When he approached Ranma with the school bag, she...as of course Ranma was female and would be for awhile... took it with solemnity but no fuss. "You're okay with this, son?"</p><p>Ranma sighed, "Yeah, I guess so. I mean even you can be right once in awhile. I was real stupid. Now I just gotta make up for it..."</p><p>"But you hate school."</p><p>"Yeah, I do, but I've done it before."</p><p>"Not as a girl."</p><p>Ranma turned toward Genma "Pops, do you <i>want</i> me to kick your ass? 'Cuz I will you know."</p><p>Just then Nabiki passed them both in her school uniform. She smiled as she passed Ranma "You'll be going to the same school as Akane and me. See ya there!"</p><p>"Nabiki!" Akane called from inside "Wait! We'll go with you!"</p><p>Nabiki stopped on the porch and turned to say "<i>What </i>are you <i>talking </i>about? I wouldn't want to come between you and Ranma. After all she's <i>your</i> fiancée."</p><p>Genma felt a rush of heat come out of the door followed shortly by Akane wielding the dining room table as a weapon with startling effectiveness "NABIKI NO BAKA!"</p><p>"Just what are you planning to do, little sister? Hit me? Hmm...that doesn't sound like something Daddy would approve of..."</p><p>Genma wasn't sure if it was just his child's presence that was causing this or if it happened all the time, but his friend had entrusted both Nabiki's and Akane's training to him, and he for one could not stand this any longer. "STOP!" He bellowed.</p><p>He was always rather proud of his deep, resonating, voice. He always thought that was his best feature, which was one of the reasons he incorporated it into the Yamasenken. Genma fought down the sudden urge to steal something and spoke as calmly and evenly as he could. "My friend, your father, has given both you girls over to me as students. As your sensei, I expressly forbid any more of this nonsense. Akane, you will not, under any circumstances attack Nabiki outside of training. She, as I understand it, is not as skilled as you, and you should never attack the weak..."</p><p>Akane grew defensive. "I KNOW that, Uncle, but..."</p><p>"I am your SENSEI!"</p><p>"No you're not! Ran..." Akane nodded her head at Ranma, who was waving her hands and shaking her head, her face wide eyed and mouthing the word "no."</p><p>Akane relaxed, carrying the table with the top of her head now rather than her arms, "Yes, sensei." With that, she sullenly returned the table to its previous place in the dining room, and came back outside.</p><p>Genma grunted in approval and turned toward Nabiki. "And Nabiki, I want to make this perfectly clear. There..." Genma had to fight to say the next words "is no engagement. We are here because I am friends with your father and we intend to pay our way. Your comments about your sister show a lack of honor unbecoming of a Tendo. I don't know what you've been able to get away with in the past, but as long as you're in my sight..." Genma stepped up to Nabiki letting his girth and height become more apparent to the girl. He looked down at her head. She wasn't looking at him. Her eyes were on the koi pond. Genma took the collar of her blouse and shook. Now Nabiki's eyes were wide. Now she was paying attention. "As long as you're in my sight you are MINE!" Genma released Nabiki. "I answer to your father and no one else on this matter. If you have a problem, discuss it with him."</p><p>"Jeez, Pops, you're laying it on a little thick ain't ya?" Ranma spoke out of the corner of her mouth, "I mean, she was only teasing, right?"</p><p>Genma came within a breath of striking his own son in anger. It was true that Genma often struck his son in anger, but as much as it would make him feel better, and even though he wouldn't hit near full force, it would eventually lead to Ranma kicking him into the pond and Genma being a panda, which really wouldn't gain him any respect as a sensei. Genma took that breath. He decided to exploit the teacher/student situation a little further. "Are you challenging me, Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes went wide again. "No, Pops! Just... makin a comment is all."</p><p>Genma nodded. He wondered why he hadn't tried that earlier...in China. But of course he knew the reason. Guilt. Guilt and exhaustion. Genma turned to Nabiki with a grim expression. "If it were only teasing I would not take offense. But you seem to think my s- daughter and your <i>own sister</i> are not fit to walk with you."</p><p>"Hey, yeah! Where do you get off bein so high and mighty?" Ranma added.</p><p>"High and mighty? Me? I would never <i>dream</i> of acting that way. I was simply allowing you and my little sister some privacy." Nabiki rebuked with a smirk.</p><p>"A martial artist must learn humility," Genma continued, "For sometimes he must look at an opponent's feet, before he...or she...can know where they stand."</p><p>Akane smiled and bowed nervously, "Uncle...I mean, Sensei, I don't mean to be rude but it's Ranma's first day and we really ought to be early..."</p><p>"Fine. You may leave."</p><p>They all prepared to make a run for it.</p><p>"But you leave together." They froze comically just before their first step. "Holding hands."</p><p>"Aw man! I don't wanna hold anyone's <i>hand</i>!" Ranma pouted.</p><p>"Um...Unc- Sensei? That's going to slow us down quite a bit..."Akane noted.</p><p>"I can't believe this!" Nabiki exclaimed.</p><p>Genma smiled, and tilted his head, causing the sun to glare off his glasses. "Consider it training."</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>After Genma recounts this much to his friend, Soun laughs. "I must say, Saotome; that was genius." Soun slaps Genma on the back.</p><p>"Yes, well I shouldn't have blown up at Nabiki like that..."</p><p>"No, my friend, I think that's exactly what you should have done." Soun takes the small towelette off his head and soaks it in the furo water. "I have been too lenient on them all I think. I can't stand hurting them, you understand. Before...she would always be the disciplinarian, when she... left...I just couldn't do it. It wasn't in me." Soun folds the towel back and puts it on his head, "Saotome, to be able to raise your child the way you did, to be her sensei as well as her father- I think it takes a special kind of love, a love mixed with courage... and faith."</p><p>Genma's eyes mist over as he remembers his son, tied up and covered with fishcakes. He remembers how he felt then. He was going to do it! He was going to make his son a man among men! Ranma would learn this technique and become the best martial artist in the world. Then they could go home... back to Nodoka. Ranma was progressing so quickly, he was so good already, Genma just wanted to yell out how proud of him he was, how much he loved him, but he kept it inside. He had to make Ranma strong. After he learned this technique...maybe he could be a father for a little while. He would get Ranma a nice big sundae; maybe take him to a movie...</p><p>Keeping his excitement to himself, Genma pushed Ranma into the pit...</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>"It's a stupid kind of love, Tendo," Genma says solemnly wiping at the tears behind his glasses, "I should have stayed, got help for Nodoka...at least then Ranma would have had a home..."</p><p>"Saotome, you did what you thought was right. Besides," Soun crosses his arms resolutely, "she has a home now."</p><p>"Yes," Genma says looking at his friend with new respect. The worried, naïve teenager is still in there, but now only within a strong, solid, and mature, if maybe a little sad outer casing. The past ten years have changed Soun. And they have changed Genma as well. "Thank you, Tendo. Maybe Ranma does have a home now...he and Nabiki are even getting along a little better."</p><p>"Oh? That's right. You hadn't finished telling me how today went... What did you find out at school?" Soun's face was serious.</p><p>"You knew I snuck out after them?" Genma asks, surprised.</p><p>"Yes. I watched you after the girls left for school... I only saw you do what you did one time before...when we defeated the master."</p><p>Genma slapped a hand on his forehead "You saw me start the technique."</p><p>"You told me you were never going to use the Umisenken again. That it was sealed as tightly as the old master."</p><p>"Yes, well...a couple times on the road I came pretty close to starving, and today...I just wanted to make sure the boy didn't do anything stupid."</p><p>"Saotome, if the technique is not sealed, then you must teach it to me. If the schools are to be joined their must be no secrets between them."</p><p>"Tendo, some things should not be taught. The 'Sea of a Thousand Fists' is one of them."</p><p>"I'm not suggesting you give away your secrets to anyone who gives you shelter..."</p><p>Genma grimaces. He doesn't know what he was thinking when he gave that scroll to Kumon...</p><p>"You did give the Umisenken away, didn't you," Soun crossed his arms.</p><p>"No..."</p><p>Soun's head turns purple and grows enormous. Steam shoots out of Soun's ears and his tongue flickers snake like out of his mouth. "DON'T LIE TO ME, SAOTOME!"</p><p>Genma stammers for a moment unable to speak, he forgot about his friend's demon head. Genma can see where Akane must have got her temper. "I...I...assure I am not lying, my friend. I did not give away the Umisenken..."</p><p>Soun's head retracts to normal size.</p><p>"I gave away the Yamasenken."</p><p>"You have ANOTHER secret technique?...And you gave it away?"</p><p>"I was hungry..."</p><p>"Yes, of course you were." Soun sighs. "Forgive me, Saotome...your secrets are your own to keep or give away as you please. It's just frustrating...you were always the master's favorite..."</p><p>"Be glad of that, my friend. I would not wish his attentions on the wickedest of oni..."</p><p>"True...So why did you ran around town using a secret invisibility technique if I may ask?"</p><p>"Ranma hasn't been in school for almost two years. And now he's going as a girl..."</p><p>"You were worried."</p><p>"Yes, I was worried. I still am."</p><p>"So...what happened?""</p><p>Genma smiles, remembering. "Yes, well, as you know I love eavesdropping on people. Especially when they're talking about me..."</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>Genma walked, unseen, by the three girls holding hands. He was closest to Nabiki, and as she said some rather un-nice things about him he couldn't help but make the occasional face at her. She seemed to get angrier as time wore on though. Genma was worried he might have to step in...</p><p>"You don't understand, Nabiki." Ranma explained, her left hand tightly holding Nabiki's right as the middle Tendo daughter tried to jerk her arm free. "Pops'll know if ya stop holdin my hand. Believe me. Ore don't know how he does it, it's almost like he's got a technique that turns him invisible or somethin, but just when ya think you're free of him, he runs up ta ya out of nowhere ta give ya a lecture about somethin ya just did that was wrong. Most the time, its just annoyin...but you get him mad and he's the sensei from Hell."</p><p>"Ranma, you used 'Ore' again," Akane admonished.</p><p>"Um...Ore did? Ore mean... Atashi did? Whoops"</p><p>Akane had been trying to make Ranma speak more like a girl with little success. Genma was rather disturbed by the situation, but he could see the practicality of it.</p><p>"Well, you see, Saotome," Nabiki said, ignoring Ranma and Akane's repartee, "that's where the threat falls apart. Watashi am not that man's student. Watashi do not take orders from a panda." With that she tugged again, trying to pull her hand free and failing.</p><p>Genma was worried. How could he deal with this? If Nabiki truly didn't want to learn from him there was no way to make her...</p><p>"Hey wait a minute, Akane. Nabiki uses 'Watashi' Why can't Ore use 'Watashi'?"</p><p>Akane was thoughtful for a moment. "You could... But you're so unfeminine really you need to use 'Atashi' to make up for it."</p><p>"Hello? You're hurting my hand, Saotome! Let go." Nabiki said, trying a different tactic.</p><p>"Hmm? But Ore was holdin it tight 'cause you kept tryin ta break free."</p><p>Akane lightly kicked the back of Ranma's calf. "Ranma you used 'Ore' again."</p><p>"Oops."</p><p>"Look just because you two get a big kick out of holding each other's hands, doesn't mean I have to participate. Let. Me. GO." Genma hadn't realized how calm and composed Nabiki actually was until she started raising her voice.</p><p>"Sorry, Nabiki, if ya wanna get free, you're gonna have to fight me," Ranma smiled. There was silence for awhile as the girls and Genma walked. Finally Ranma spoke again. "You know, Nabiki, ever since Ore got here...er ever since Atashi got here you've molested me, insulted me, insulted Akane, Kasumi, even your own dad. You've taken pictures of me'n Akane naked, and now you wanna break your promise to your father by not doin what Pops asked. What's your beef exactly? Is it me? Why do Ore...why do Atashi piss you off so much?"</p><p>"Honestly, Nabiki," Akane added with a frown, "Ranma's right. You've been acting terrible ever since she got here. Is this still about Ranma not being a boy? Did you want to get engaged that badly?"</p><p>Nabiki looked stunned for a moment...and then chuckled sardonically. "You think this is about that? Do you have any idea, little sister, what I have to go through just to make sure we still have a roof over our heads the next day?"</p><p>"Nabiki," Akane responded, "I know you do a lot but-"</p><p>"You don't know the half of it, Akane-chan." Nabiki interrupted. She held out her free hand as if holding a ball. "There is so much information, Akane. Information that I...that we ALL need in order to survive. All sorts of threads tangled up in this mass that only I seem to be able to comprehend. I have to pull them Akane, I have to pull these threads, make the ball tighter, compact. And I have to be careful because one wrong pull, one thread out of place...and the whole thing can unravel." She dropped her hand to her side, dramatically letting the ball fall apart. "If I had more money though..."</p><p>"Look, Ore don't see why Ore can't use Watashi if Ore want to. If Atashi want to. If Watashi want to!" Ranma was starting to get a little flustered, "Ore...Watashi mean...Nabiki ain't exactly a Japanese princess or nothin and she musta used 'Watashi' like forty times just then."</p><p>"Do you care at all about what I said, Saotome, or were you just counting up all the 'Watashi's?"</p><p>"Um...yeah sure. That was hot water for something, right?"</p><p>"'Metaphor', Ranma," Akane supplied, "and if you want to be a perverted, vengeful girl who scares everyone that knows her, by all means use 'Watashi'" Akane's free hand was clenched in a fist and she seemed to stomp more than walk. Apparently Akane still had some issues with her older sister.</p><p>"Good point," Ranma conceded. She seemed taken aback, and Genma didn't blame her. She was coming very close to having two women mad at her.</p><p>"And Nabiki," Akane added, "if you just wanted a fiancé for money why didn't you go after Kuno?"</p><p>"Who's Kuno?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh he's a rich idiot upperclassman from school," Akane answered with a wave of her free hand, "Carries a stick and harasses me. Addresses himself as 'Boku'"</p><p>"Oh." Ranma frowned for a moment. "So Ore... Atashi can't use 'Boku' either?"</p><p>"I did go out with Kuno." Nabiki stated coldly before Akane could respond. "Once. You probably don't remember. It was near the end of last school year. You were outside practicing and Kuno drove up in a limousine." Nabiki stepped in front of Ranma so she could address Akane more directly. "A limo, Akane!" Nabiki looked away towards a small pothole in the road as she fell back in line. "That was the night he first confessed his undying love for you."</p><p>An awkward pause, then Akane spoke. "You had something to do with the boys at school didn't you Nabiki." It was not a question.</p><p>"The boys at school?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You know that weight set you got for your birthday, little sister?" Nabiki ignored Ranma, "90,000 yen at least. How do you think it was paid for? Each of those boys paid me to fight you. They bet against you and lost. You should be happy about that. You should thank me. Instead you call me a pervert."</p><p>A red aura coalesced around Akane. "You're the most PERVERTED person I KNOW!"</p><p>"Hey, Akane, calm down will you? Getting angry just makes ya stupid."</p><p>"I am not stupid, Ranma!" Akane yelled at the redhead.</p><p>Genma winced. It must be a family curse, he reckoned. Genma didn't remember ever teaching the boy how to mess up so badly with women, but Ranma learned it from him anyway. Of course it wasn't just with women. Genma couldn't count the number of times he had MEANT to say "I'll work if you feed me," but INSTEAD said something along the lines of "I'll give you my first born for a pickle" or "Hey look! A ten yen coin!" Most people didn't understand these kinds of flub ups, but everyone could understand a little nervousness around the ladies. Unfortunately for Ranma, she WAS a lady right now. How could Ranma be so stupid? Taking that vial...why would Ranma even accept such a thing?</p><p>Ranma cringed at Akane comment as well. "Woah, Ore didn't say ya were stupid... Ore just said...Ore just said that gettin angry made ya ACT that way!"</p><p>Akane's anger eased and she smiled. "'Atashi,' Ranma. Honestly, will you ever learn?"</p><p>Genma blinked. That would have never worked if Ranma were still a boy...</p><p>Nabiki smiled, "You'll have to excuse my little sister, Saotome. She has a short fuse about some things."</p><p>Ranma turned to Nabiki and beamed. "That's okay, Nabiki, at least she ain't a perverted, backstabbin bitch."</p><p>"Touché" Nabiki conceded.</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked confused.</p><p>"Touché...its French...never mind." Nabiki waved it off with her free left hand. Suddenly she stopped walking. "Wait."</p><p>Water splashed in the space just in front of the three girls. It came from the ladle of an elderly lady standing in the entrance of her house's garden.</p><p>"GOOD MORNING, GRANDMOTHER SHIRATORI!" Nabiki called out.</p><p>Mrs. Shiratori turned around three times counter-clockwise, put her bucket and ladle down and squinted at Nabiki, Akane, and Ranma for a few moments before recognition registered on her face. "Oh, why good morning, Nabiki-chan! It's been a while since you've been by. Washi thought you had a ride with your friend, what's-her-name."</p><p>"Hey," Ranma whispered to Akane, "She's a woman and she uses 'Washi,' just like Pops. Why can't Ore use that?"</p><p>"You're not old enough. Don't you know ANYTHING?" Akane whispered back, "And you used 'Ore' again."</p><p>Nabiki grimaced, "May I introduce Saotome Ranma?" Nabiki motioned to Ranma with her free left hand in a wide, sweeping motion.</p><p>"Hi there," Ranma bowed her head in greeting, a somewhat confused look on her face.</p><p>"She and her father are staying at our home for..." Nabiki turned her head to Ranma, "How long was it you were planning on staying?"</p><p>"What the hell you askin me for?" Ranma responded.</p><p>"At any rate," Nabiki smiled turning back to Shiratori-san, "Akane and I thought we'd help Saotome out. You see she's a little shy."</p><p>"Ore ain't shy," Ranma asserted.</p><p>Akane kicked her in the calf again.</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked, "Oh...sorry."</p><p>Shiratori hobbled closer to Ranma put a weathered and wrinkled hand up to the redhead's brow, and closed her eyes. "I see a boy with slate-gray eyes...I see him fading away...I see dark forces in the distance approaching...becoming more distinct...madness...a woman in a white kimono...death." The old woman opened her eyes and the light of the morning sun reflected off them like the tips of daggers. "These things will come to pass if you continue on your present path." She took her hand off Ranma's forehead.</p><p>Ranma's jaw was slack, her eyes wide, her skin pale.</p><p>Genma was sure his own face, were it visible, would look much the same. Who was this Shiratori woman? Was what she said true? Was Ranma's male side going to fade away? And how did she know about Nodoka?</p><p>"I see you got back 'Martinique'" Nabiki said loudly, gesturing to the ladle by the entrance of Shiratori's home.</p><p>The old woman's somber features softened to a smile, as she turned toward Nabiki again. "Yes, Asuza-chan gave it back after some cajoling."</p><p>"Really? That's all it took?" Nabiki asked in her raised voice smirking.</p><p>Shiratori cackled, "I might have said one or two nasty things about her marriage prospects..."</p><p>"You're an evil old woman, you know that?" Nabiki smiled.</p><p>"And you're a malicious, perverse, and money hungry little girl." Shiratori rejoindered.</p><p>"We know each other so well don't we?" Nabiki laughed. "It's been nice talking with you again. I have to see these two idiots to school now."</p><p>"I am NOT an IDIOT!" Akane protested.</p><p>Ranma lightly kicked her in the calf.</p><p>"WHAT DO YOU WANT?...oh sorry." Akane smiled sheepishly, calming down.</p><p>"Still hot tempered as ever, eh Akane-chan?" Shiratori jeered, "Such a tomboy. It's no wonder you don't ever bother to say hello to a lonely old woman. Just like a man."</p><p>Akane shook her free fist at the wizened face. "MAYBE if such a lonely old woman would stop INSULTING me every chance she got, I'd make more of an EFFORT!"</p><p>Shiratori cackled again, "And what would be the fun in that, young one?" There was a small pause as Akane tried to assimilate this, then Shiratori spoke again. "Go, child, before something unpleasant flies in that gaping mouth of yours." The girls left Shiratori to mutter to herself, smiling. "The youth are so uncouth. Uncouth youth. Forsooth..."</p><p>Genma stayed behind. He had to find out what this Shiratori knew. There was however the small matter of getting out of the Umisenken without revealing it to anyone...</p><p>"That girl, Saotome..." Shiratori spoke loudly looking off into the distance, "Her future troubles you."</p><p>Genma started. She had sensed him?</p><p>"Yes, I know you are here. I'm blind as a bat, but I can see as long as wills collide. Your will is strong enough to read by. You didn't like what I said about the red-haired girl."</p><p>Genma dropped all pretense of hiding and spoke. "He's my son."</p><p>"I see... That explains a lot then." The old woman turned around three times clockwise and picked up the bucket of water and the ladle. She began splashing the street pensively. The pace was slow and random, yet somehow soothingly rhythmic, like waves crashing on the beach. Genma was about to speak again when Shiratori stopped. "I have a small gift. I can see the paths that people are on. I know a little of what lay ahead. But people change paths all the time. They go in new directions based on the choices they make."</p><p>A young couple walked by arguing vehemently about some rumor one had heard about the other. Shiratori smiled, dipped her ladle in the bucket, and splashed the girl.</p><p>"Aw jeez," the boyfriend responded, "I knew we should've taken the other way. Hey look it's chilly. Why don't you put on my over-shirt? Then you can change clothes once we get to school." The girl nodded and accepted the shirt with a hesitant smile.</p><p>When they left, they were holding hands.</p><p>Shiratori nodded. "You can exert a force in this, but you must be careful which way you push." She turned toward Genma and held out her bucket and ladle. Her gaze was disturbingly off target. Genma supposed he should have been used to that sort of thing from his experiences with the Umisenken, but with Shiratori, more than with anyone before, her intense focus on something beyond Genma made him feel as if he didn't really exist. "Take these, you will need them."</p><p>Genma hesitantly accepted the proffered bucket and ladle with a quizzical look. "What could I do with this?" Genma asked.</p><p>In response, the old woman turned three times widdershins and stepped backward with her left foot, bringing her right even with it. She continued toward the entrance of her house in this manner, as if part of some backwards wedding procession. She had made five strides along the gravel pathway before saying, "Remember, Saotome Genma, it is often unwise to blaze new trails. Wait for a crossroads before changing directions."</p><p>Genma bowed his head in thought for a while, than lifted and nodded sagely. As Shiratori evanesced into the shadows of her domicile Genma smiled and wondered if the old biddy knew he understood exactly what she said. He had, after all, been subjected to years full of obscure sayings and vague prophetic warnings due to his dealings with the old master. All she was saying was that sometimes it was better to use a fork.</p><p>Genma had to admit that was true, although he was rather fond of chopsticks.</p><p>He couldn't quite figure out, though, what that had to do with Ranma. He also wondered if maybe he should find a quick snack. The bamboo earlier that morning had been surprisingly edible, but somehow it just wasn't very filling...This led Genma to question how it was that the bamboo that he ate as a panda wasn't making him sick as a man. Could it have been converted to something else? Fish and rice perhaps? Mmmm...fish and rice...with mayonnaise, some soy sauce and a raw egg to finish it off...that would be heaven right about now...</p><p>Genma shook his head. As delicious as that sounded, he could not head back to the dojo, he had students to watch over. He wasn't even hungry. Couldn't be. He ate a whole platter full of that bamboo. Then again how much do pandas eat? Maybe he should...Genma sniffed. Was someone cooking chicken? His mouth watered...He could hear the laughter of the Master in the tinkling of the canal water past the fence. He shuddered and gripped the bucket and ladle tightly. No. Ranma and the girls first. Then chicken.</p><p>Carrying the ladle and bucket, Genma reestablished the Umisenken and hurried to catch up with his students.</p><p>When he reached them, Nabiki was once again trying to get Ranma to let go of her hand. "Listen, Saotome, I propose a wager...a challenge, if you will."</p><p>"Oh yeah? What kinda challenge?"</p><p>"I don't think you want to be holding my hand any more than I want to be holding yours. I propose we both let go. If your father shows up knowing about it, I will agree to what your father AND you say as a sensei for a week. If the panda is clueless however, you have to agree to pose for some pictures."</p><p>Genma smiled. He was going to get to punish someone again! He crouched behind a bush in someone's backyard and let the two and a half girls walk a little ahead.</p><p>"Don't do it, Ranma" Akane warned "She hardly ever makes a bet unless she's sure she's going to win."</p><p>"Maybe. But she don't know my Pops." Ranma turned to Nabiki, "You're on." Ranma smirked. "On the count of three. One."</p><p>Genma stopped using the Umisenken and crept out from behind the bush.</p><p>"Two."</p><p>Smirking, Genma readied the ladle and bucket.</p><p>"Three." Ranma released Nabiki's hand with a flourish.</p><p>Genma gave them a good five seconds before splashing Nabiki and Ranma with the freezing cold water.</p><p>"Well, it looks like- GAH!" Nabiki exclaimed.</p><p>The two girls and Ranma whirled around. Strangely enough, Ranma didn't seem to be wet at all. "Unless your father says otherwise, I am your sensei. You must learn respect, Nabiki."</p><p>"See," Ranma said with a smirk, "Ore toldja, Nabiki."</p><p>"Ranma... 'Atashi'..."</p><p>"Oh right. Sorry 'kane."</p><p>"Don't think you are exempt, Ranma. You let go of Nabiki's hand just as much as she let go of yours." Genma aimed another water balloon sized ladle blast at Ranma again. The water somehow bent away from Ranma and splashed into Nabiki again full force.</p><p>"Aw c'mon, Pops." Ranma protested, apparently ignorant of the water's acrobatics, "I'm still holdin Akane's hand ain't I?"</p><p>"Th-th-there's no way..." Nabiki shivered, soaking wet, her eyes wide.</p><p>Looking at Nabiki's surprised expression was enough to make Genma forget the oddness with the water. He smiled. "You have to learn your limits, girl. You cannot know everything about your environment no matter how keen your senses." There was a flash of light and a rumbling. Genma ignored it. "You have to be ready for any situation, regardless of how it looks." Several rain drops fell from the sky landing on Genma's gi. "Even now there might be an assassin lurking unseen behind a bush or maybe in that canal waiting to attack." Genma pointed to the canal of rushing water behind the chain link fence as a sudden gust of wind blew more rain drops in his face. "You must keep your senses sharp watch for things behind you above you and to your sides as well as in front. But always be prepared because growf ga growfer row grop...Growf!" Genma had forgotten about the curse... he hadn't even noticed the change.</p><p>"Hey Pops!" Ranma taunted, "Guess ya shoulda been more prepared huh? Guess ya shoulda been payin attention to what was above ya, huh? Like for instance the big ass rain cloud?"</p><p>"Um... Ranma?" Akane tugged at the sleeve of her new friend's red silk Chinese over-shirt with her free hand.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Why aren't we wet? It's raining pretty hard..."</p><p>Genma's fur kept the cold of the chilly spring rain off his body, but the water did make his fur rather heavy and uncomfortable. Nabiki was much worse off. Her hair was plastered to her head and her uniform was dark with rainwater. Ranma and Akane, by contrast, were dry as desert flowers. The boy turned girl, showing as much need to review her surroundings as Genma had, was only just now becoming aware of this.</p><p>"Hey yeah! Woah this is cool! Must be some sorta weird side affect from that vial I drank..."</p><p>"What vial?" Akane asked.</p><p>Genma made a good show of burying his furry forehead in his paw.</p><p>"Er..." Ranma elucidated, fingering her pigtail with her free hand. "Um..." she continued. "Well, ya see..." she expanded. Finally she brought her stunning oration to a close with, "I'll tell ya later 'kay?"</p><p>Akane nodded slowly, a furrow of confusion clouding her brow. Her eyes widened as she looked over Nabiki's shoulder at the billboard with the green digital time display. Genma followed her gaze, thankful that his curse didn't affect his sight that much, he read 8:32. Seeing as school started at 8:30, this was not a good thing. "Oh no! We're late!" Akane exclaimed</p><p>"Well Nabiki kinda held us back, complainin and chattin with that weird old lady..." Ranma pointed out.</p><p>Nabiki looked like she had a few things to say about that, but she was shivering too hard to respond. Now that Nabiki was officially his student, Genma would have to subject her to some vigorous environmental training. It was a good twenty degrees Celsius. Even in heavy rain, that should be plenty warm enough for any martial artist. Still Genma didn't want Nabiki getting sick or anything, "Growfer growf growf growf growfer growf growfer growf growf," Genma suggested.</p><p>"Thanks, Pops, I think that was the best advice ya ever gave," Ranma said with half-lidded eyes.</p><p>Akane raised her head as her eyes brightened, "Well, as long as we're late, we might as well stop by Tofu's. Nabiki can warm up there and we might even get passes for school!"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Sounds good to me... Nabiki, ya gonna get outta the rain?" Ranma offered her hand.</p><p>Grimacing, Nabiki accepted. "You'll b-be s-sorry ab-bout th-this."</p><p>"Yeah well, when I am I'll let ya know."</p><p>Nabiki was still wet but the rain didn't go through the field that Ranma seemed to generate. It just bent away from him as if he were a reverse magnet for the water. Of course, ever since the curse, Ranma had been a water magnet, but this was a little more literal than Genma would have thought. As for Genma, for some reason water never sought him out as much. Of course, half the time he was in his cursed form anyway; so it didn't matter, but Genma wondered why water was attracted to Ranma so much more sometimes. Now apparently water was doing the opposite.</p><p>Shrugging Genma decided he was sick of having his pelt pelted by rain and grabbed Nabiki's wrist with his paw. Almost instantly, the rain seemed to stop...only it didn't. It gave Genma a feeling of being a disembodied spirit. His panda countenance would betray none of it, but the truth was, Genma found this a tad unsettling.</p><p>Nabiki looked up at Genma, startled. Then she turned her head toward Ranma. Then she sighed and looked ahead, her eyes no doubt burning a path through the rain ahead of them.</p><p>"So this doctor Tofu, he's pretty good huh?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh he's great," Akane insured, "He's so good at medicine and acupuncture he's practically a wizard."</p><p>And with that Akane, the scare-cat, the tin woman, and the cowardly panda went off to see this "wizard."</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>Genma pauses to stretch a bit in the furo waters. He notices a young man listening to a waterproof walkman. Genma and Soun are sitting fairly close to one corner of the public bath and the short haired young man sits across from them against the edge adjacent to theirs. When Genma sees him, he looks away, as if he had been staring at Genma for a while. He has a sort of ratty complexion with small eyes that seem to glare mischievously while his mouth curls in a slight smile. Genma wonders if the boy is gay. This brings him alarmingly to the subject of his own child's sexuality. As long as Ranma still changed with water, Genma was sure he'd just be attracted to girls and there'd be no problem. But now... what if Ranma's a girl forever? Genma didn't want a daughter of his to be a lesbian, but what could he do? What if the boy across from Genma is a girl cursed to be in a boy's body?</p><p>"So... Ranma is waterproof?" Soun asks, distracting Genma from his disturbing thoughts.</p><p>"Yes, as far as I've been able to tell. Hot water hits him just fine but cold water just bends around him and anyone he's holding hands with."</p><p>"That's odd. What did Dr. Tofu have to say about that?"</p><p>"He said something about water being polar, but he wasn't sure how a potion could manipulate it like that." Genma leaned back. "Tendo, how can such a young boy know so much?"</p><p>"It was his father," Soun replied somberly, "They were very close."</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"For the longest time it was a mystery. Tofu's father was a doctor, a good one, but neither he nor any other professional could figure out what was wrong with him. He just got weaker and weaker until..." Soun swallowed, "Tofu's father died when the boy was sixteen. He had been sick for two years. After that, Tofu flew through school, he was determined to make his father proud. And I'm sure he has. The boy is already a fine doctor. Don't call him Doctor Ono though. He jokes around, but he's still a little sensitive about being called the same thing his father was."</p><p>"Did he ever figure out what killed his father?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"What was it?"</p><p>"A curse."</p><p>"You mean magic?"</p><p>"Yes. It was a fairly simple curse as I understand it. But still...it almost killed Kasumi."</p><p>"Kasumi was cursed too?"</p><p>Soun's eyes grew watery, "Tofu saved my baby, Saotome. That boy's a saint. I'd give him almost anything just for that, but he won't accept it. Not one yen. And he's been our family doctor ever since then. He's never charged us for anything, and I tell you he's the best doctor you could ever hope to find."</p><p>"Hmm...I guess I shouldn't feel so embarrassed about working for him then."</p><p>"You're working for him?"</p><p>"Yes, starting tomorrow. I was asking for Ranma, but Tofu said that he needed an assistant that could work during school hours."</p><p>"Saotome...I'm glad you're helping Tofu out, but...aren't you a little over qualified?"</p><p>"Tendo, I'm forty-two years old, I have no formal education, the only thing I really know how to do well is steal things and beat people up. What else am I going to do?"</p><p>"You could help me in the dojo..."</p><p>"Yes and I'm going to, but the only students you have right now are your own children and two of them dropped out."</p><p>Soun starts to stand out of the water, "Saotome that's low..."</p><p>"Calm down, Tendo. I'm just stating the facts. We've got to face it, my friend. Unless we do something about it, Anything Goes is going to fade away, and all that pain, all that suffering that the demon put us through is going to be for nothing."</p><p>Soun sits on the edge, out of the water. Genma joins him as he finds the heat of the water a little stifling himself.</p><p>"You're right of course," Soun sighs, "I really have been depending on Nabiki too much these past few years. Grandmother Shiratori...she may be a little... eccentric but she really helped out after...that year. She actually managed to amass a great deal of wealth in her younger days, despite being a woman of low birth. Nabiki talked with her everyday... she used to do things like that, you know. She always had a knack for knowing when people needed company... When it happened...I wasn't worth much I'm afraid. Shiratori started paying Nabiki for doing odd jobs for her, and somehow we always had enough to get by. Akane and Kasumi find Grandmother Shiratori to be difficult, but Nabiki...she loves that old woman to death. Had I known she'd be such a bad influence... but then what could I have done? Nabiki's been the real bread winner for our family since she was seven. I feel like I've been sleeping all this time, and I'm only just now waking up."</p><p>"You've done nothing all this time?"</p><p>"It's not as bad as that really. I go to parent teacher meetings, I do odd jobs for people...Sometimes I'll find out about some robbery or assault and I'll help catch the criminal responsible. Some people seem to think I should run for some kind of office, but I don't know if they're joking or not."</p><p>"Tendo, that would be perfect for you! Even when you were a scraggly punk kid you always got the girls. Even when we both got caught on a raid, you could get out of it much quicker than I ever could."</p><p>"What are you saying, Saotome?"</p><p>"You have charisma, Tendo! That's something I could never manage."</p><p>"Maybe you're right. It's worth a try anyway. I've been going to the town meetings more often recently and I think I might have a few connections..."</p><p>Genma thinks of something. "Tendo...Is Shiratori really psychic?"</p><p>Soun eases himself back into the water. "That's not an easy question to answer, my friend. Some of the things she says... Something you ought to know though is she likes to mess with people. Sometimes she'll say things just to get a reaction. It's no use trying to understand that woman. She's said things to me I wouldn't dare repeat even under threat of death they were so vulgar."</p><p>"Come now, no one could be as crass as the master."</p><p>Soun looks up at Genma and it seems coals are burning in his eyes. "The master never knew my wife."</p><p>Genma can say nothing to that. He lowers himself back into the water. He notices the boy with the walkman is staring at him again. Genma tries to imagine that the boy is a beautiful woman, but shortly comes to the decision that even if it were a woman staring at him it would be disturbing. In fact the effort in trying to imagine that the rat-faced boy could be a girl is disturbing in itself. Genma is about to ask the boy to find something else to occupy his attention when Soun speaks.</p><p>"What happened when they got to school?"</p><p>Genma is rather glad for the distraction. "I allowed them to stop holding hands but they still arrived at school more or less together. I stayed a little longer at Tofu's discussing employment, so I'm not sure of how it happened, but when I caught up to them at school, this Kuno character was keeping them from entering the school..."</p><p>"Yes, yes...Kuno. Tell me, what's the boy really like? I get such a negative impression from Akane."</p><p>"Well, I'll say this...the boy is determined. And he has some measure of skill. And he IS somewhat chivalrous in a backwards sort of way but..."</p><p>"But?"</p><p>"He's a buffoon."</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>Kuno barred Akane's way with his outstretched bokken. Strangely enough Akane giggled. "Kuno...honestly... you're late to class. I have got a pass so I don't care how long you keep me out here, but you're going to have to stand in the hall."</p><p>"Such a meager sacrifice I would gladly pay to banter with one of such fierce beauty." A breeze blew past, which might have been properly dramatic except Kuno was rather soaked from the earlier downpour and the breeze just caused him to shiver.</p><p>"I don't have time for this," Nabiki declared and walked past the tableau, further breaking the tension.</p><p>"Go then, wench. I have no need of your presence," Kuno retorted. "But hark! Who is this maiden that doth accompany Diana on the hunt?"</p><p>Akane nudged Ranma in the ribs. "He's talking about you."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Fair maid of the fiery hair," Kuno got on one knee and grabbed Ranma's hand, "Tell me how I may address you!"</p><p>"Um...well I'm..."</p><p>"Wait! Is it not customary to give one's own name first?"</p><p>"Um..."</p><p>Kuno stood up, clasping Ranma's hand to his heart. "Very well! Mine I shall give! Know that it is the rising star of Furinkan High School and leader of its Kendo team, Kuno Tatewaki, the Blue Thunder who speaks to you now." Kuno had his bokken raised up into the air. It would have been really impressive if there had been a crack of lightening or something, but alas, the shower that might have produced such special effects was long gone.</p><p>Ranma jerked her hand out of Kuno's grasp and got in a fighting stance. "Watch it buddy, Ore ain't real interested in gettin ta know you better. In fact, why doncha just shut yer pie hole and get out of my face before Ore rearrange yours?"</p><p>"Ranma..."Akane muttered out of the corner of her mouth.</p><p>"Diana's companion has zest as well! Very well, I will engage you in combat, pigtailed one, but I would have the name of my opponent."</p><p>"Name's Saotome Ranma of the Saotome school of Anything Goes Martial Arts, and Ore am gonna..."</p><p>"Ranma!" Akane yelled.</p><p>"Sorry...Atashi am gonna kick yer ass!"</p><p>Genma watched unseen from a bush, coming out of the Umisenken so he could concentrate fully on the fight. Ranma almost lunged at Kuno, but then stopped herself. Genma nodded, whispering the words he told the boy many times. Don't make the first move hastily. Watch your opponent, note his strengths and weaknesses. If he attacks, respond, but otherwise be calm and reveal nothing.</p><p>"Your move, Kuno, I'm ready when you are," Ranma growled. Akane yelled again but Ranma didn't seem to care.</p><p>Kuno went from holding his weapon two handed in front of him to standing sideways with the bokken over his head. This marked Kuno as being largely restricted to his own style. In sword fighting, a win came often after a few, well placed hits, so the beginning stance was much more important. This was only true, however, in refereed matches and with bladed weapons. Kuno was using a wooden bokken and his opponent was completely unarmed. These exaggerated stances were completely useless and dangerously limiting unless... Genma looked closer. The stances weren't just good. They were perfect. The feet were at the exact optimum angle, the "blade" of the bokken at just the right cant. Even though Kendo was not Genma's focus in the Art, he was impressed. To enter even a simple stance so flawlessly required great discipline, and Kuno did it so naturally it would have seemed second nature, were he not so obviously using the stances to show off.</p><p>"Nay, I must insist beauty come before brawn," Kuno said over his shoulder before moving his bokken to his side, its point as still as a rock in cement oriented in Ranma's direction.</p><p>Genma knew this comment was winding Ranma up to no end. He could see her face twitch in the effort to stay focused. He also knew that Ranma hardly ever trained in his girl body, despite his agreeing that it was a good idea. The fight would be harder than Ranma might think. Looking between the two of them, he could feel the tension mount. Everything slowed to a crawl. Noises melted into the background until it seemed that all that existed were Kuno, Ranma, Akane, and himself.</p><p>Finally, taking her cue from somewhere within herself, or perhaps a higher power, Ranma charged.</p><p>Genma grimaced. So much for Ranma's training.</p><p>Ranma jumped into a flying sidekick that would have impacted Kuno's face quite painfully, except the move was so obvious that Kuno would have had to be brain dead to miss it. Stepping to the side in a flourish, he lightly whacked Ranma on the back with the bokken. "I have smote thee, fair maiden. As my prize..."</p><p>"You ain't smote shit, stick boy!" And Ranma swung her leg around in a high hook kick that caught Kuno at the base of the skull.</p><p>Kuno staggered forward and his eyes widened a moment before he turned around his bokken straight in front of him again. "A hit! Albeit fowl. Mayhap I needs must demonstrate my prowess further."</p><p>"I don't want nothin ta do with your 'prowess'!" Ranma exclaimed but kept herself from lashing out again.</p><p>Kuno swung lazily at Ranma with the bokken. Ranma dodged easily. Kuno smiled and swung again, this time making a side swipe across Ranma's middle. Ranma jumped over the swing and somersaulted in the air before landing behind Kuno and executing a powerful roundhouse to the kendoist's temple.</p><p>Kuno staggered to the side and then righted himself, shaking his head to help clear his vision. "Certes, thou art a nimble nymph. I have dallied long enough. It is time this battle cease." With that Kuno became a whirlwind of motion, his blade a wooden blur in space as he attacked Ranma.</p><p>Ranma dodged every blow with ease, her body jerking one way then the other. Every other swing Ranma punched Kuno in a new location until finally she nailed him in the solar plexus causing the boy to gasp for breath. Ranma followed up with a snap kick to the chin a hook kick to the eardrum, an axe kick to the collarbone and finally a throw to the ground. Ranma straddled Kuno and put her hand around the boy's throat, fire dancing in her eyes. "Don't ya EVER touch me again. Ya got that? I don't even wanna catch ya LOOKIN at me! Cuz if ya do, we're gonna finish this and ya ain't gonna like the endin."</p><p>"Very well," wheezed Kuno. "I shall allow you to date...me." And with that he fell unconscious.</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma asked no one in particular.</p><p>"I tried to warn you," Akane sighed, putting a hand on Ranma's shoulder, "Kuno has this...thing for girls who fight. Ask Nabiki to tell you about Linda sometime."</p><p>"Linda?"</p><p>"American exchange student. Female boxer. She was only here a week before she transferred back. Best thing she could have done really...the mental hospitals are better in America."</p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>"Yes, Ranma?"</p><p>"Do ya think if we go inside right now he'll forget what I look like?"</p><p>"Doubt it, but I guess It's worth a shot," Akane shrugged. And with that the two ran into the school"</p><p>~~~~~.~~~~~</p><p>"The boy has an interesting pick up line," Soun remarks with a smile as he sits in the bath.</p><p>"A buffoon, I believe I said," Genma nods.</p><p>"Yes, I recall...still I wouldn't say he's completely moronic..."</p><p>"He was holding back. I imagine even if Ranma hadn't dodged those whirlwind swings they wouldn't have even caused a bruise. The boy WANTED Ranma to beat him up. I consider that sufficiently moronic."</p><p>"I don't know...that's more or less how I met..." Soun choked up.</p><p>"That was different. You weren't TRYING to get beat up, you just were...Why can't you say her name?"</p><p>"Saotome, please...you didn't know her like I did. She was precious, beautiful...a goddess. I am not worthy of uttering those three syllables... not yet. Maybe...once Anything Goes is secure..." Tendo trailed off looking wistfully at some point in space.</p><p>"Tendo, I'm sure she loves you now as she did in life. She would not think you unworthy..."</p><p>"Her love is something I do not yet deserve, Saotome. Regardless of how you may see it, that's how I feel, and it's going to take more than mere words to change that."</p><p>"Fine, but try to remember, you're a good man, Tendo Soun. Maybe you don't know it, and maybe no one else does either, but I do. I've fought beside you in too many battles not to."</p><p>Soun is silent for a moment, "Saotome...thank you. You're a good man too."</p><p>Genma half smiles, half grimaces at that. He has done terrible things, torn apart families, upset whole cultures, abandoned his wife and tortured his child. He came to Nerima, not to help out his friend, but because he was tired of it all, because he had all but given up on teaching Ranma anything worthwhile, because he wanted to shirk his responsibility onto someone else and live the rest of his life in shame. Instead his responsibilities increased tenfold since he has come here, and truth be told, he's been looking for the slightest opportunity to run away. Maybe he was a good man once... but not anymore. Still, hearing his friend say it, Genma wonders... Maybe if he stays, maybe if he can somehow do the impossible and teach Anything Goes to the Tendo daughters, maybe if he can save his friend from his self doubt and depression, he can be a good man again. "I hope so, Tendo," Genma says, "I hope so."</p><p>"Saotome, I know you have your reasons but I feel I must bring this up...Nodoka is <i>not</i> dead. You need to at least talk with her. It's been ten years..."</p><p>"No, Tendo. I'm not ready to see her. And I don't want Ranma thinking his mother is anything other than the loving, nurturing woman she was before that night. I don't think I can trust her again..."</p><p>"You have to give her a chance..."</p><p>"No, Tendo, it's more than that. When it comes down to it, I signed a contract. I was to make Ranma a man among men. Regardless of how good Ranma is, the fact of the matter is that I failed. If Nodoka finds out about Ranma...It's true I've broken many contracts but there are two I aim to keep. Someday the Tendo and Saotome lines will be joined, and someday Ranma will be a man among men. Until one is secure, I cannot risk failing the other. That would be the end of the last shred of honor I have left."</p><p>"I understand." Soun takes in a breath, "Still, I can't let you waste any more time away from your wife...I just can't. In the fall, we visit the family gravesite...I'll give you till then. Then I send Nodoka a letter telling her you're here."</p><p>Genma sighs, "Fair enough. Maybe by then this business with Ranma being stuck will be over." Genma looks at his hands. "Well, my friend, I suppose it's time to leave, my hands are wrinklier than the old master!"</p><p>"Nothing's that wrinkled," Soun smiles, "I guess you can finish telling me about today on the way back."</p><p>"Not much to tell really. As far as I saw, Ranma was okay at school. After he and Akane left, they went shopping... there were too many people for me to use the Umisenken so I couldn't get close to them...I'd rather not tell what I saw...it was too embarrassing. After they left they went job hunting, and as you know they were lucky and they both got jobs working in a restaurant."</p><p>"A miracle is more like it."</p><p>Genma gets out of the bath and speaks dismissively. "Well yes. I didn't see the interview because I was a little...distracted." He always felt the expression "all you can eat" was something of a challenge... "At any rate most of the rest you know as well as I do."</p><p>Genma notices the rat-faced possibly gay boy is getting up too, turning off a switch on his walkman and carrying it with him out of the bath blithely by the antenna. Genma pauses, a confused look on his face.</p><p>"What's wrong, Saotome?"</p><p>"Tendo...Have you ever seen a walkman with an antenna before?"</p><p>"No..."Soun answers, "can't say that I have. Why?"</p><p>There is one odd scene Genma recalls from his surveillance of Furinkan earlier today. During lunch, Genma saw Nabiki leave the building with a boy. The boy had seemed nervous at first, then excited after Nabiki said something to him. After the boy left Nabiki looked up... and Genma could have sworn she looked straight at him. He wasn't in the Umisenken, but still he was so quiet no one should have noticed him. It made him think maybe Nabiki had more talent than she had let on.</p><p>Perched in a tree so that he was level with the third floor and could see Ranma in his classroom, Genma wasn't at the best angle to see the boy, but still the hairstyle, the body structure... both were similar to that of the boy currently holding a walkman with a conspicuous antenna.</p><p>Quickly, Genma grabs the boy's ear, almost forgetting to be careful not to rip it off the skull.</p><p>"YEEEEOOOWTCH!" the boy protests.</p><p>"Where is she?" Genma asks.</p><p>"ARGH! Stop it man, that hurts! Look, I owed her money okay? Listening to two old men talk isn't my idea of a good...AAAAAH! Look man, Ranma's secret's safe with me okay? I'm not telling anybody!"</p><p>Genma hadn't thought about what he said about Ranma...if Nabiki was listening... "Where is Nabiki?" Genma repeats with a pull of the ear.</p><p>"YEOW! She's in the girls' side of the baths okay? Jeez!"</p><p>Genma releases the ear and runs to the sinks. Someone just finished filling a bucket with cold water. Genma takes it and pours it over his head.</p><p>"What are you doing, Saotome?" Soun asks surprised.</p><p>"Growf." Genma says by way of response.</p><p>"Hey!" the boy calls out to him as he bounds past, "If Ranma does go girl, could I date her?"</p><p>Genma stops, turns around, raises his paws, and towers over the boy. "GRAWR!"</p><p>"Sorry, man, I just had to ask. She's just so hot..."</p><p>Ignoring the arguably not gay boy's apology, Genma runs to the girls' side of the bath. It takes only a few moments before he finds what he is looking for.</p><p>Nabiki stands, smirking, in a two piece bathing suit, towel in one hand, waterproof radio in the other. "Why hello there, Saotome-sensei! I believe I have something I want to learn from you after all. Thanks to my good friend Daisuke, I know all sorts of things about you and yours...really it's enough to fill a book! One thing in particular...I'm quite fascinated by this 'Sea of a Thousand Fists' technique. Maybe you could tell me more about that?"</p><p>"Growf." Genma protests.</p><p>"Isn't that what you wanted? Didn't you want me to be your student? Didn't you want me to 'understand'? Well here's your chance. You teach me the Umisenken...and I'll be sure Ranma doesn't hear about his poor, mentally unsound mother."</p><p>"Grrrrow," Genma seethes.</p><p>"Please, Saotome-sensei, you're making a scene!" Nabiki smiles widely looking from side to side with her eyes to call attention to the other girls in the public bath who are busy pointing and wondering if now would be a good time to scream. "Do we have a deal or not?"</p><p>Genma is silent and still for a few moments as he considers his options. He decides he really doesn't have any. He turns around and starts to walk away.</p><p>"Was that a yes, sensei? Or should I give Ranma a call?"</p><p>In a flash, Genma whips around and backhands Nabiki in the temple with his paw... just enough to knock her out. Maybe before Jusenkyo, before the Amazons, even before he found out about this subterfuge, he would have felt sorry about doing that to a girl, but his experiences have made him a firm believer in equal rights.</p><p>Ignoring the screams and protestations around him, Genma slings Nabiki on one shoulder and walks out of the public bath. He pays no mind to Soun's look of worry and confusion. It's a long walk to the Tendo home, but Genma doesn't feel discouraged, in fact quite the contrary. As he thinks about it, he realizes Nabiki knowing Ranma's true sex will scarcely be a problem, and she would have found out sometime anyway. Furthermore, there is no way Nabiki can learn the Umisenken at her level. Even Ranma would find it difficult. As the initial fear of his secrets being revealed to Ranma fades, Genma realizes that Nabiki was right. What she was asking for is EXACTLY what he wants. He finds himself wishing his panda form could whistle...</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~</p><p>Thanks to everyone who gave a review, and I'm sorry I took so long getting this out. Apologies as well to anyone who was hoping to see more of Ranma. I just thought showing Genma's perspective on things would be neat.</p><p>My prereaders for this chapter were NemesisZero and Lufio.</p><p>C&amp;C very much appreciated.</p>
