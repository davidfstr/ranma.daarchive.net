</div>Ranma 1/2 Belongs to Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan<p>Thanks to KPJAM, Merc, Dracos, Unseen, Ammadeau, hkmiller and DB Sommer<br/>for excellent C&amp;C.<p>Pretty Psycho Magical Project: Kodachi!<br/>by Ebiris ()<br/>Chapter 1<p>"Do you feel it? This evil energy approaching the blue Earth?"<p>A small creature emitted a sharp gasp as it turned its attention to the<br/>speaker. "I... I have felt nothing..." he whispered in a tiny voice,<br/>even though he hardly looked like a being in posession of the necessary<br/>self-awareness for speech.<p>The first speaker turned around. Her long blonde hair, which almost<br/>reached the floor, billowing out dramatically with the movement to catch<br/>the light in such a manner as to send irridescent waves rippling through<br/>it. "I have felt it..." she announced, her melodic voice leaving no room<br/>for doubt.<p>"D-does this mean...?" the second asked hesitantly, trying and failing<br/>to keep doubt from his voice.<p>The blonde woman nodded as she bent down to pick up her companion, who<br/>felt tiny and fragile cupped in her hands. "You know how I am<br/>constrained in this," she said, her voice thick with suppressed emotion.<br/>"I truly wish I did not have to place you in this position, my friend."<p>The small creature in her hands felt his heart puff up with pride. He<br/>had always considered himself but a humble servant, to hear her speak of<br/>him as a friend was something he had not expected. "There was never any<br/>choice; I will do everything that I can to carry out your will."<p>The woman nodded sadly, her almond-shaped eyes starting to glisten with<br/>as yet unshed tears. "Go now. Go to the blue Earth and guide my champion<br/>to defend it from this threat. I..." Now a few tears did slip down her<br/>porcelain cheeks, as she despaired at just how little she could truly<br/>do. "I will lend what power I can to... to help."<p>"Please do not cry," the small creature urged plaintively. "We always<br/>knew this day would come, and must have faith that it will turn out for<br/>the best."<p>She gave him a wan, but heartfelt smile at that. "Go," she said simply.<br/>"Go with my blessing." With that, she leaned forward and planted a small<br/>kiss on the creature's forehead before he seemed to vanish in a shimmer<br/>of sparkling motes.<p>Her longtime companion gone, the woman returned her attention to the<br/>blue and white orb visible beyond the crystalline confines of her home,<br/>and whispered, "I will pray for you, Dokuchu..."<p>***<p>"Ohohohoho!"<p>Kodachi Kuno merrily bounced along the rooftops of Nerima as she made<br/>her way home from school, her delightful laugh advertising her good mood<br/>to any who would care to listen.<p>And why shouldn't she be in a good mood? She was young, rich, and<br/>beautiful; truly she was blessed by the Gods themselves. All she needed<br/>to make her life complete was the love of a good man, and she had just<br/>the perfect man in mind.<p>"Ranma-sama..." she breathed out the name of her beloved in a reverent<br/>tone while alighting on a streetlight to briefly survey the plebeians<br/>who walked the common streets beneath her. But her Ranma-sama wasn't<br/>beneath her! If ever there was a man worthy of the Black Rose, it was<br/>he. Just thinking of being held in those strong arms of his, rippling<br/>with powerful yet well-toned muscle, was enough to send delightful<br/>shivers through her body. Truly her Ranma-sama was a man among men!<p>It was then that Kodachi spotted something, or rather someone, that sent<br/>her mood plummeting. "It's that wretched pigtailed girl," she groaned at<br/>seeing the short redhead casually strolling along the fence below, her<br/>hands stuffed in her pockets while she cheerfully whistled what only the<br/>most tone deaf person could ever consider to be a tune. "Oh, how I<br/>despise you!" Kodachi hissed as she attempted to burn the little wench<br/>to ashes with the sheer force of her hateful glare.<p>Just looking at the way the bitch dressed in an obviously transparent<br/>imitation of Ranma-sama made the Black Rose shudder with barely<br/>contained rage. The girl's garb even looked like it was oversized enough<br/>to fit on Ranma-sama's larger frame! She might not be able to fault the<br/>pigtailed girl's taste in men (except for the few times she led Tatewaki<br/>on, though it was pretty obvious she was just cruelly playing with him -<br/>which was something Kodachi could respect), but her desperate copying of<br/>Ranma-sama's appearance and mannerisms hinted at a dangerously unstable<br/>mind.<p>And people called *her* crazy? The thought was enough to make Kodachi<br/>laugh. Which she did. With great aplomb.<p>The pigtailed girl looked up at the blood curdling noise and visibly<br/>flinched, an act which only increased Kodachi's mirth. If she could<br/>still inspire fear in the only person to ever defeat her, then she must<br/>be doing something right!<p>Now feeling more secure of her situation, Kodachi dropped from her perch<br/>to land lightly on the chain link fence that the redhead was walking<br/>along. "And how are you on this fine day, pigtailed girl?" Kodachi<br/>inquired in a syrupy voice, leaning forward and using her superior<br/>height to intimidate the other girl. "Coming up with some plot to seduce<br/>Ranma-sama away for yourself, hmmm?"<p>The pigtailed girl's previously nervous expression changed to one of<br/>marked distaste, and when she matched Kodachi's gaze, the taller girl<br/>realised she probably shouldn't have pushed her like this, for there was<br/>a simmering anger in those cerulean eyes, which warned that she was not<br/>going to put up with much crap today. "Not everyone is obsessed with<br/>stuff like that, Kodachi," she ground out, clenching her small fists at<br/>her sides.<p>"Liar!" Kodachi spat right back. "How could any woman not think of such<br/>things when it concerns such a fine specimen as Ranma-sama? You want him<br/>just as much as the rest of us do, admit it!"<p>The pigtailed girl recoiled as if struck before firming her stance once<br/>more. "I sure as hell don't, Kodachi! Besides, Ranma is..." she paused<br/>and her expression once more showed distaste, "Akane's fiance."<p>Kodachi snorted in a nonetheless ladylike manner. "Pish tosh! Ranma-sama<br/>is also engaged to that Kuonji girl and... married or some such<br/>according to the backwards tribal law of that Chinese wench. A man such<br/>as he is not to be tied down by the arrangements of others! Ranma-sama<br/>will follow his heart to find true love, and I aim to make sure that he<br/>finds me!" she postured dramatically as she finished her little speech.<p>The pigtailed girl looked slightly flustered, and blushed quite<br/>noticeably, which gave Kodachi some pause as it was not the reaction she<br/>had expected. Then, seeming to collect herself, the pigtailed girl blew<br/>up her bangs in frustration before looking the other girl in the eyes.<br/>"Look... Kodachi," she said, trying hard to keep her tone light, but<br/>obviously coming across as very irritated. "You should just give up on<br/>Ranma... it'd be best for everyone if you did."<p>"Hmph. Better for you perhaps. But I am not so easily deterred. For a<br/>prize such as Ranma-sama, I can overcome anything!" With those<br/>determined words, Kodachi twirled her ribbon and leapt onto a nearby<br/>rooftop, bounding across Nerima and spraying black rose petals as she<br/>went. She was laughing of course; laughing loudly and incessantly.<p>***<p>Kodachi had returned to the noble Kuno estate, and was greeted at the<br/>front hall by two blown up pictures of two smiling female faces, one of<br/>Akane Tendou, the other of the pigtailed girl. To add further insult,<br/>the picture of the pigtailed girl clearly showed she was wearing a<br/>leotard, meaning the picture came from the martial arts rhythmic<br/>gymnastics match in which she had defeated Kodachi.<p>Kodachi growled low in her throat. It was an unspoken truce of the Kuno<br/>household, that she would keep her pictures of Ranma-sama in her bedroom<br/>or the greenhouse, while Tatewaki would keep pictures of his two 'loves'<br/>in his bedroom or the dojo. All other parts of the house were supposed<br/>to be neutral, to avoid setting off the volatile tempers of either Kuno<br/>child.<p>"Looks like Tatewaki woke up stupid today." Kodachi murmered, snapping<br/>out her ribbon to shred the offending portraits.<p>She had barely begun her task when her older brother charged into the<br/>hall, bokken held high above his head. "Horrid woman! How dare you<br/>strike at the images of my two loves!"<p>"Oops," Kodachi remarked coldly. "My hand must have slipped." Her ribbon<br/>lashed out to slice into Tatewaki's hakama, causing him to step back<br/>slightly. "Oh, there it goes again. Be careful, brother dearest, I seem<br/>to be awfully clumsy today."<p>"Foul wench!" Tatewaki snarled angrily. "It is bad enough that you<br/>defile such images of feminine beauty, but to strike at the noble Blue<br/>Thunder? This defies comprehension!"<p>"It is only difficult to comprehend for your limited intellect, brother<br/>dear." Kodachi lazily twirled her ribbon in a small loop, but remained<br/>poised to lash out at the least provocation. "It is unseemly for such<br/>garish images of those two harlots to decorate the halls of the Kuno<br/>home."<p>"And what of your foul images of that fiend Saotome?" Tatewaki<br/>challenged, visibly restraining himself from attacking.<p>"You leave my Ranma-sama out of this!" Kodachi screamed, losing her cool<br/>exterior for a moment before regaining her poise. "Besides, I only keep<br/>those photos where I can see them, so you have no reason to get upset."<p>Tatewaki raised his bokken high, clutching it so tightly that his<br/>knuckles turned white. "The very notion that images of that fiend should<br/>find residence in any room within the noble Kuno estate is a crime<br/>against our ancestors! The heavens weep at this injustice!" Obviously<br/>feeling great sympathy for the heavens, Tatekwai started crying himself,<br/>though of course, in a dignified and noble fashion.<p>Kodachi sighed at her brother's theatrics. "Speaking of the pigtailed<br/>girl, I ran into her on my way home today. She asked me to pass<br/>something onto you."<p>"Truly...? But of course, my sweet pigtailed girl no doubt yearns for my<br/>presence! So much so that she even risked speaking with a frightful<br/>creature such as yourself! Pray tell what did the no doubt blushing<br/>maiden ask to be conveyed to the noble Blue Thunder?"<p>"She gave you flowers. Catch." Kodachi tossed a bouquet of black roses<br/>which Tatewaki reflexively caught before being stunned by the small<br/>burst of paralysis powder from them.<p>Now feeling slightly better, Kodachi headed towards her room, leaving<br/>her insensate brother behind.<p>***<p>Dokuchu took in his surroundings with a faint sense of awe. Admittedly,<br/>the narrow street overlooking one of Tokyo's numerous storm canals and<br/>bordered by middle-income housing wasn't all that impressive. Especially<br/>compared to the crystalline cathedral high above the Earth which he<br/>called home, but the very newness of his situation was enough to impress<br/>the small creature.<p>"I can feel it... the one with the potential definitely passed here<br/>recently!" he said as his senses stretched out to find the one who could<br/>protect the world from the approaching threat.<p>Wrinkling his pert little nose, Dokuchu looked this way and that. From<br/>what he could tell, there were actually several people in this city who<br/>possessed the right aptitudes and potential...<p>"Oh, this is rather confusing... I wish I'd had more practice at this,"<br/>he lamented while trying to isolate the one which would best serve to<br/>become a protector against evil, since he only had one chance to bestow<br/>the power, and if he chose the wrong person it could prove disastrous!<p>Deciding to take a systematic approach, he set off to find the nearest<br/>candidate. After he viewed all of them, he'd make his decision.<p>***<p>Arriving at the location of his first possibility, Dokuchu had settled<br/>into a comfortable spot under a bush by the koi pond to observe things<br/>before he made any attempt at contacting the girl who could potentially<br/>save the Earth. This gave him the perfect opportunity to witness such<br/>insanity as to tempt him into letting the 'approaching evil' have its<br/>way with the planet.<p>"Boy! Your fiancee is cooking dinner! Be sure to eat it all up. Tendou<br/>and I are going on a training trip!" a portly, balding man in a dirty<br/>white gi yelled at the petite redhead whom Dokuchu was observing.<p>'Boy?' wondered the small magical creature.<p>The girl seemed enraged at these words, and started yelling furiously,<br/>"No way, old man! I'm not gonna suffer by myself! Either we all eat it,<br/>or none of us do!"<p>"Ranma-kun, can't you show some loyalty to your fiancee?" the other man<br/>wailed, this one taller than his companion (and also possessing a full<br/>head of hair).<p>"Can't you show some loyalty to your daughter?" the girl now identified<br/>as Ranma, shot right back.<p>At this man curled into a ball and started crying while his friend<br/>patted him on the back in an ineffectual effort at comforting him and<br/>glared at the girl. "You made him cry, have you no shame?"<p>Before Ranma could retort, another girl entered Dokuchu's field of<br/>vision. This one looked about the same age as Ranma, and appeared rather<br/>harried with her short hair frazzled and her apron covered in filth.<br/>"Would you all stop yelling? It's hard enough to concentrate on dinner<br/>without hearing this!" she screamed loudly.<p>"Uh... Akane..." Ranma piped up timidly, no doubt intimidated by the<br/>other girl's verbal barrage, "If you need to concentrate on cooking, you<br/>shouldn't leave the kitchen."<p>Akane blithely waved off those concerns. "Don't worry, Ranma. I left the<br/>heat up on full so it won't get cold. This'll be the best dinner you<br/>ever ate, trust me!"<p>There was a loud sizzling noise of pots boiling over, followed by a<br/>series of loud pops and wet squelching noises coming from the kitchen.<p>"Probably be the last dinner I ever eat..." Ranma mumbled quietly,<br/>though not quietly enough.<p>"What did you say?" Akane asked politely. As politely as one can ask<br/>when every vein in your forehead is visibly throbbing and you're<br/>desperately reigning in the overwhelming urge to severely maim the<br/>person you're talking to.<p>"I have come to claim my bride!"<p>"Huh? I didn't say that!" Ranma protested, looking around frantically<br/>for the source of that booming statement.<p>"Nay, 'twas I, Prince Ynesbrg!"<p>Everyone's eyes turned to rest on the figure alighted on the wall<br/>surrounding the Tendou dojo. He was a fairly unimpressive figure of a<br/>man, even if you discounted the fact that his skin was a rather<br/>unhealthy puke green colour, standing at a full four and a half feet<br/>tall and dressed in little more than a loincloth that looked like it was<br/>made of seaweed. Perhaps the oddest thing about him (besides the green<br/>skin) was the fin like protuberances coming from his back, upper arms<br/>and calves.<p>"What the hell are you doing here, then?" Ranma demanded, though she did<br/>look slightly relieved, probably because his appearance had distracted<br/>Akane from meting out punishment...<p>Prince Ynesbrg postured dramatically before speaking up in his booming<br/>voice that was incongruous with his diminutive stature. "The portents of<br/>the dreamers pointed me to this place where I may find my bride; the one<br/>whose dark recipes will provide fuel for the awakening of the Old Gods<br/>who slumber deep beneath R'lyeh! Akane Tendou, I have come for you!"<p>At this, Ranma doubled over in mirth. "Haha! That tells us everything<br/>about your cooking, Akane!" she guffawed merrily until a small piglet<br/>emerged from underneath the table and leapt up to scratch at her face<br/>with its little (and surprisingly sharp) hooves.<p>"Hey, don't insult my cooking! You're upsetting P-chan!" Akane yelled,<br/>brandishing her mallet threateningly.<p>"Dammit pig! Why don't you eat her cooking then?" Ranma gave P-chan a<br/>vicious kick which sent him flying against the wall underneath Prince<br/>Ynesbrg.<p>This was where Dokuchu decided he had seen enough. Deep One cults were<br/>not under the purview of magical girls and their cuddly mascots, no way<br/>did he want to get involved in that. Besides, seeing how Ranma had<br/>treated that cute little piglet did not bode well for any relationship<br/>she might develop with a cute magical girl mascot such as himself.<p>Dokuchu ran from the Tendou dojo as fast as his little legs would carry<br/>him, the sounds of explosions and screaming seeming to follow him as he<br/>fled...<p>***<p>"Okay... choice number two..." Dokuchu remarked to himself as he snuck<br/>in through the slightly open window on the second floor of a small house<br/>only ten minutes away from the Tendou dojo (of course, at the speed he<br/>was fleeing that makes a considerable distance).<p>He could feel this one was weaker than any of the others with potential,<br/>but since that Ranma girl had been the strongest, Dokuchu was quite<br/>aware that raw power wasn't the be all and end all.<p>Looking at the sign on the bedroom door where her aura was most built<br/>up, he read the name 'Sayuri' which was most likely the name of the girl<br/>he wanted. She wasn't in that room right now though, but he could hear<br/>someone moving around in the bathroom across the hall, and sensed her<br/>aura was in there, too. There was no one else in the house as far as he<br/>could tell.<p>"Oh shit!"<p>Dokuchu's head snapped towards the bathroom door in alarm at that<br/>frightened yell. What was wrong?<p>"It's positive!"<p>Positive?<p>"Oh god, I don't even know who the father could be... it's probably<br/>either Souichirou-sensei or Daisuke... I doubt it's Shiro... Damn! It<br/>better not be Hiroshi or Yuka's gonna kill me!"<p>Comprehension dawned over Dokuchu as he listened to the girl's panicked<br/>babbling. Well, pregnancy would rule her out for the hazardous job of<br/>being a magical girl. Besides, he didn't really want the future of the<br/>earth placed in the hands of such a loose girl...<p>***<p>Dokuchu looked around in confusion. He could have sworn the third person<br/>was here, but all he could see was an old lady rinsing her front porch<br/>and a wet cat. Straining his senses, he confirmed that the aura was<br/>coming from the cat.<p>'Well, that's no good,' he decided. 'A cat can't become a magical girl<br/>to save the planet.' Besides, cats just plain creeped him out.<p>***<p>"I hope this one is okay... she's my last hope..." Dokuchu told himself<br/>as he entered the large house, blissfully unaware of the many fatal<br/>traps he had avoided thanks to his tiny size.<p>Making his way through the mazelike interior of the mansion, Dokuchu<br/>followed his esoteric senses which unerringly guided him towards the<br/>last potential magical girl he had been able to detect.<p>Entering the room she currently resided in, Dokuchu was able to<br/>stealthily observe her from where he clinged to the ceiling.<p>She was hunched over a desk, still dressed in a school uniform and<br/>concentrating intently on the books scattered haphazardly in front of<br/>her.<p>'She's studious, that's always good!' thought Dokuchu with some good<br/>cheer as he noted that the chemistry problems she was working on seemed<br/>to be at a rather high level.<p>Looking around the room, he noted it was very clean and well kept, with<br/>many different flowers dotted around to brighten things up (although<br/>most of the flowers were black roses, there were a few others which<br/>provided a nice contrast). Also, the bookshelf was filled with difficult<br/>looking books on chemistry and botany, and a large cabinet contained<br/>lots of trophies for various gymnastic competitions, and also revealed<br/>that her name was Kodachi Kuno.<p>'A healthy mind and a healthy body! Looks like I've hit paydirt with<br/>this one!' Dokuchu was more than pleased as he prepared to reveal<br/>himself to the girl and bestow upon her the power to protect the planet.<p>***<p>Kodachi yawned as she closed her book and stretched languidly. A glance<br/>at the carriage clock on her nightstand showed it to be just after five.<br/>"I suppose I had best make a start on dinner. Father will be home soon<br/>and Tatewaki will be waking up as well..."<p>She was then rather startled as a small animal dropped from the ceiling<br/>to land on her bed. It looked like a rodent nearly half a foot in length<br/>with a short fluffy tail. Its fur was mostly purple except for on top of<br/>its head, which was green and slightly longer than the rest, giving a<br/>shaggy effect.<p>Kodachi's mouth formed a small 'o' as she stared at the bizarre little<br/>creature, and her shock only increased when it started to talk. "My name<br/>is Dokuchu, I've been looking for you, Kodachi."<p>The gymnast wobbled in her seat for a second before collecting herself.<br/>"How odd. It appears that the extract from those lilies I was working on<br/>this morning have a delayed hallucinogenic effect. I shall have to make<br/>a note of this..."<p>"I'm not a hallucination, Kodachi! You have to listen to me!" Dokuchu<br/>protested earnestly in his squeaky little voice.<p>"Of course you're a hallucination," Kodachi said in a condescending<br/>manner. "But don't worry, it should wear off soon enough, so I can<br/>ignore you until then."<p>"No, seriously, I'm a space lemming, and I've come to find you!" Dokuchu<br/>said insistently, standing up on his hind legs and making a begging<br/>gesture with his forepaws.<p>"A miniature giant space lemming?" Kodachi asked, sounding quite<br/>serious.<p>Dokuchu blinked at that absurd idea. "Of course not! I'm perfectly<br/>proportioned!" he said indignantly before calming slightly. "Anyway,<br/>Kodachi, the earth is threatened by a great evil, and only you have the<br/>power to save it!" Well, he sure as hell didn't want to work with that<br/>Ranma girl, and the other two options had been duds...<p>"Ohohohoho!" Kodachi covered her mouth with the back of her hand and<br/>laughed gaily. "Of course only one such as I could possess the qualities<br/>needed to protect the world!" she then blinked and calmed down with a<br/>visible effort. "Still, I shouldn't allow my hallucinations to get me so<br/>excited, it's not healthy. I'll have to ignore you now, little space<br/>lemming thing."<p>"My name is Dokuchu! And I'll prove I'm not a hallucination!" he started<br/>chanting in a strange language as an ethereal breeze seemed to sweep<br/>through the room. A nimbus of power began to collect around the space<br/>lemming, followed by a similar one around Kodachi. "I have prepared a<br/>channel between yourself and the Goddess. Say the words from your heart<br/>and you'll receive her power to protect the Earth from evil!"<p>Deciding that she would have to give this hallucination points for<br/>effort, Kodachi nonetheless felt that things were going too far. She<br/>tried to tell Dokuchu so, but a different set of words flowed from her<br/>lips.<p>"Give me the power to defend against evil, the strength to protect love,<br/>and the spirit to never falter! I am... Cutey Thorn!"<p>A storm of flower petals, encompassing every hue of the rainbow,<br/>flurried around the girl, who threw her head back in rapture at the<br/>power she felt flowing through her veins. At the same time, several<br/>thorny vines snaked around her body<p>Dokuchu blushed and averted his eyes when he noticed her school uniform<br/>disappearing. Her modesty was still protected by the petals and vines,<br/>but it was still extremely suggestive. Of course, it still didn't do<br/>anything for him - he was a lemming after all, not a man - but he had to<br/>respect his new charge's dignity.<p>When the lightshow died down, Kodachi was still standing there,<br/>twitching slightly with her head lolled back and her eyes closed. And<br/>she had a massive grin on her face. But the most noticeable thing was<br/>the change in her attire.<p>Starting from the bottom, her feet were now covered in black rose petals<br/>which overlapped each other and came up to her calves to almost look<br/>like boots from a distance. Then her legs were completely bare up to her<br/>crotch which was barely covered by several silver ribbons which snaked<br/>in-between her legs and looped around her waist, leaving very little to<br/>the imagination. Her breasts were similarly on display, being barely<br/>covered with a mixture of black rose petals and cherry blossom which<br/>overlaid each other to form a continuous covering over each breast up to<br/>the nipple and around her back, but left the valley of her cleavage<br/>totally open for viewing. She had nothing covering her arms except for<br/>several thorny vines twisting around each forearm, and although the<br/>jagged barbs looked quite wicked, they seemed to cause the girl no<br/>discomfort. Lastly, her side ponytail was now bound by another small<br/>thorny vine instead of its usual ribbon.<p>Kodachi's head rolled forward and she blinked a few times, still<br/>sporting a goofy grin. "I don't believe I've ever felt a rush that<br/>intense, and that's saying something!" She then spotted her reflection<br/>in the mirror and blushed furiously, covering her cheek with a palm.<br/>"Oh, my! Such a scandalous outfit! I simply must wear it to my next<br/>gymnastics competition! Oh..." her smile took on a decidedly lecherous<br/>quality, "I wonder what Ranma-sama will say when he sees me like<br/>this..."<p>Sadly before she could drift off into a pleasant fantasy about Ranma,<br/>Dokuchu interrupted. "You can't wear it for competitions or seducing<br/>your boyfriend! This is what you look like when you're the fighter<br/>against evil, Cutey Thorn!"<p>Kodachi arched a delicate eyebrow. "Cutey Thorn?" she repeated the name<br/>incredulously. "I think not. My peers have always known me as the Black<br/>Rose, and that I shall continue to be known!"<p>"No! This is meant to be a secret identity. You can't let people know<br/>who you really are when you're like this!" Dokuchu protested vehemently.<p>"Why not?"<p>"It's too dangerous!"<p>Kodachi smirked, "I laugh in the face of danger." Putting action to<br/>words, she did just that, letting loose a gale of psychotic sounding<br/>laughter.<p>Dokuchu floundered for a second before recovering his wits. "If people<br/>know you're really a magical girl superheroine they'll constantly harass<br/>you! You'll never get a moment of peace."<p>Kodachi considered that for a second before responding. "I don't really<br/>care about that, but maybe having a secret identity would be fun... so<br/>is this like those shoujo manga where no one can tell my true identity<br/>even though I'm not disguised in any way?"<p>"It's magic." Dokuchu nodded smugly.<p>A wicked glint appeared in Kodachi's eyes. "Oh yes, I see there is much<br/>potential in this..."<p>***<p>End Chapter
