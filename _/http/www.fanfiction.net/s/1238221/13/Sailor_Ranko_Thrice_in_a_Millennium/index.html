</div><p style="text-align:center;">Sailor Ranko - Thrice in a Millennium<br/>Chapter 13:  Birds come to roost</p><p style="text-align:center;">By Rebecca Ann Heineman</p><p style="text-align:center;">I don't own these characters. Please don't sue me,  kill me or make me reinstall Microsoft Windows again, and again, and  again...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The lunch bell rang at Furinkan High, signaling the end of the  current class and the start of the noon break. Hikaru Gosenkugi  sighed as everyone gathered in groups that didn't involve him. In  short time, he was sitting all alone, in the corner, utterly ignored.  He reached into his desk and pulled out his book bag, clutching it to  his chest like it contained the secrets of the universe. Truth be  told, that's just what was in the bag.<p>He snuck out of the classroom, an act that was trivial for him  since no one even bothered to shoot a glance in his direction. He  slithered around a corner and ducked into the shadows. Numerous  students ran by his location, all on the never ending quest to be  first in line at the cafeteria to get the best breads before they  were all sold out.</p><p>Once the mass of students had disappeared down the stairs, the  lanky teenager silently tip toed down the stairs and toward the  library. Taking a look to the left and to the right, hoping one of  the resident bullies weren't around to beat him up for his lunch  money, he cautiously approached the open doorway and peered in. He  saw the librarian typing away on a terminal with one hand and holding  a sandwich in the other. He smiled upon seeing that no one else was  in the room.</p><p>Hina, the elderly librarian, looked up from her screen as Hikaru  made his almost silent entrance. She put her lunch down, took off her  bifocals and wiped them clean with a tissue as she spoke with a happy  expression. "Today's your lucky day."</p><p>Hikaru's face became paler than normal, turning white like fresh  snow. He couldn't believe that he actually had luck that wasn't bad,  terrible or awful. "I-It came?"</p><p>"This morning, Hon'. Let me get it for you." She  swiveled around in her office chair and rummaged around behind her  librarian's counter. Hikaru approached the wooden desk slowly in the  hopes that he wouldn't offend the gods by being too expectant of his  long awaited prize.</p><p>"Hmm..." Hina mused as she placed a small stack of books  on the counter. "I could have sworn it came." She placed  her fingertips on the spines of the books and slid her digits upwards  as if the motion would get the books to tell her where the missing  tome was. She made a clicking sound with her tongue, a habit that  annoyed other students when they came to study, but was permissible  when only Gosenkugi was around. She, like everyone else, just didn't  care about the impossibly thin wanna be sorcerer. "Maybe it's  over there."</p><p>The lanky student sighed. "Just my luck," he surmised.  There was only one form of luck he ever experienced, and it was bad.  His eyes followed Hina as she kicked the ground and rolled in her  chair from behind the desk to the table in the center of the study  area. There was a small rolling cart stacked with books and DVDs. She  stopped with pinpoint precision in front of the cart and quickly  examined the titles. She paused and pulled out a very old looking  book and held it out for Hikaru to see. "Here it is!"</p><p>He couldn't believe his eyes. Before him, written in English  script in small letters below a large title in meaningless scribbles  were the words he dared not hope he'd ever actually see in his  lifetime, "The Demonomicon".</p><p>Gosenkugi blinked. The book was still there. He shook his head.  The book remained in view. He turned around to look at the area above  the doorway, searching for a hidden camera and some TV personality  lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to say, "Smile!  You're on hidden camera!" The live audience was nowhere to be  found.</p><p>"Hey, Hon'." Hina snapped her fingers to get his  attention. "You okay?"</p><p>"Uh..." He was mesmerized by the leather-bound cover.  Was it cow leather or did it come from something else? He didn't  really want to know the answer to that question. "Yes, I'll be  fine." He moved closer to the book, but the elder pulled it away  and held it close to her chest.</p><p>She held out her hand expectantly. "Library card?"</p><p>He froze in terror. He placed his hands on his cheeks and moaned  to the heavens! <b>"NNNNNOOOOOO!</b> I forgot it at home!"</p><p>"No cardy, no booky. Principal's rules." She rolled away  in a flash, back behind her desk; book hidden from view.</p><p>"But... But... You know me. You know I've got a card."  He pleaded to the now unresponsive librarian. He was so close to  gaining the forbidden knowledge that he couldn't leave the room  without the book. He knew that somehow, someway, if he left the room,  the book would vanish in a puff of smoke. These things just had a way  of happening around him.</p><p>"Yep, you've got a card. Where is it?" She went back to  typing one handed and finishing her sandwich with the other.</p><p>He grasped both hands together in the universal sign of total  begging. "I can't leave without that book."</p><p>"I can't give you the book without a library card." Hina  smirked. "And don't even try to ask me to bend the rules. I look  terrible in a bowl cut."</p><p>Sensing utter defeat, he would submit to complete humiliation. He  had to have that book. "I'll do it."</p><p>"What Hon'?" She filled with dread. He couldn't be  serious, no one in their right mind was going to do... That.</p><p>He was on his knees and bowed. "I have to have that book.  I'll do anything." He rubbed his hair on the top of his head.  "And I will."</p><p>"So, you'll use Article 9, I take it."</p><p>He closed his eyes. He was going to do anything and he meant it.  "I'll use Article 9."</p><p>"Okay." The librarian reached under her desk and pressed  the shiny red button. She was pleased. She's going to get a little  bonus in her pay envelope come next payday.</p><p>Principal Kuno burst into the room holding shears. His Hawaiian  shirt was the only thing louder than his entrance. "Aloha,  Keiki! I gots da call. We's be havin' an Article 9 I be takin'?"</p><p>Hina pointed to Hikaru. "He already invoked it."</p><p>The Principal was very pleased. "Good job Keiki! Da big  Kahuna will remember next Friday you bein' good hard worker. 'Elpin'  me out in makin' the Keiki look proper." Three seconds later,  Hikaru's hair was floating down to the floor and a mirror was shoved  in his face.</p><p>Hikaru sulked. He didn't look too bad with a buzz cut, but he was  going to get picked on a little more today because of it.</p><p>"Lookin' good man! Hina, you take care o' da Keiki now, why  doncha?" The palm tree haired man placed a strong hand on  Gosenkugi's shoulder. "Youza see, Keiki who follow da rules get  good privileges man. You make good choice. Now, I be off. I gotsa  find me boy and fix 'is 'air." With that, the principal vanished  as if he had never been in the room. Only a small pile of Gosenkugi's  hair and his new hairdo were the only signs of the elder's passing.</p><p>Not looking up from his gaze on the floor, Hikaru softly asked.  "Can I have my book now?"</p><p>"Sure Hon'." She snickered. She tossed the book to the  bowing man and the volume bounced off of his head. He grabbed it  before it flew out of his reach and caressed the cover with the same  care as an archeologist would upon unearthing a priceless antiquity.</p><p>Hina took the last bite of her sandwich and asked with a little  concern. "You alright there?"</p><p>He looked up with a gleam in his eye. His plans were coming to  fruition. The book had all the answers to the questions he was  asking. Tonight was going to be different. "I'm alright... Now."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi hummed a little tune to herself as she hung up the laundry  to dry. A blanket here, a karate gi there and shortly thereafter, all  of the wash was on the clothesline. She held the empty basket close  to her waist and felt her heart become as empty as the plastic  container.<p>The laundry once required eight ropes to hold it all. Now,  fluttering in the breeze, were four lines of assorted clothes. In the  past, Kasumi would have rejoiced at the lower workload. She had  wanted to spend some more time studying textbooks that she had  borrowed from Dr. Tofu and now after having been granted her wish,  she regretted it.</p><p>Nabiki was busy with her new role as the president of the Sailor  Moon Fan Club which meant she was spending almost no time at home and  was having her clothes dry cleaned. With Akane, Ranma and his mother  living in Juuban, the number of regular visitors had trickled to  almost none. Ukyou would stop by once in a while to drop off some  okonomiyaki take out for Soun, but none of Ranma or Akane's old  friends had a reason to visit anymore. With the lack of morning  sparring sessions, fights and weird happenings, the number of clothes  that needed mending or washing were far fewer than ever before.</p><p>Even though her father and Mr. Saotome were playing shogi on the  back porch, a sign that some things hadn't changed, the house felt  empty, barren and lonely. She wondered for a moment at what was to  become of her. Her sisters had found their way with Akane's  Senshihood and Nabiki's career guiding their respective lives. Her  father's finances were cared for by Nabiki so he had no wants. What  was in Kasumi's future? What did fate have in store for her? Did she  want to care for her father in his golden years? Wouldn't it have  been better to reconsider Miss Hinako as someone to fill her mother's  shoes and be a loving caring wife for Father so she could consider  something for herself instead of her family?</p><p>A teapot's whistle broke her musings and Kasumi fondly remembered  the special significance that sound meant to the occupants and guests  to her family's ancestral home. Always that high pitched tone was  followed by the footsteps of a purple cat, a white duck, a panda or  Ranma-chan wanting to change back into their birth forms. Today, the  sound only signaled that tea was ready to be served and not a general  call for a guest to come visit.</p><p>The oldest Tendo girl felt a prickling down her back as something  seemed wrong about the backyard. She turned around and spotted a  small boy wearing a magnificent silk pantsuit. He stood slightly over  one hundred and thirty centimeters tall, wearing white leather  gloves, open toed sandals, and an elaborate headdress that gave a  regal air to his ensemble. His white feathered cloak flew open as the  boy walked with purpose across the grass to the side of the largest  koi pond. The stranger planted a large staff into the ground with the  top end having a gleaming hoop of silvery metal with flames made of  the same material as decoration.</p><p>The oddest thing about the boy, not that the boy himself was  rather strange, and weird people had a habit of appearing here, was  that in his other hand he held a plastic tub with a rubber duck, a  toy lobster, bath soaps and a towel. She breathed a sigh of relief;  this boy didn't appear to be a bill collector. However, he could be  some prince coming to marry Akane or Ranma-chan. The bath supplies  were the most likely reason for his visit and the Tendo acted  accordingly as the gracious host she was.</p><p>"Young man." Kasumi asked, not really sure just who or  even what this person was. She was certain about one thing; he  shouldn't be disturbing the fish. "If you wish to take a bath,  we have a furo you could use."</p><p>The boy finally took notice that Kasumi was in his presence and  sneered in return. "Your water is impure. My journey was in  vain."</p><p>Kasumi blinked at the unexpected response. He wasn't after  someone's hand in marriage, which was a good omen. Concerned for the  well being of the koi, she asked. "Oh, my. I'm sorry, but could  you tell me what's wrong with our water?"</p><p>"I see that the Jusenkyo link to here was never completed."  He tapped the end of his strange staff into the water and a small  amount of steam bubbled out.</p><p>"Are you referring to the Jusenkyo guide who was here some  time ago. No, he wasn't able to make a Nannichuan." Kasumi  remembered when the infamous guard came to Nerima and proclaimed that  their koi pond was linked to the spring water from Jusenkyo. Much to  the dismay of the cursed, he was unsuccessful in making a spring of  drowned man and it would take one thousand years before the next time  they could try again. With this recollection, she understood just why  her new guest was interested in the pond. "Are you looking for a  cure to your curse?"</p><p>Genma's ears popped up with the most holiest of phrases. The  promise of a cure. Instantly, he was standing next to Kasumi. "A  cure you say? Where's the cure?"</p><p>The boy huffed at these clueless landlings. He twirled his staff  upside down and hopped onto a bracket mounted just under the half  meter diameter hoop. He held on to the staff like a warlock would  ride a broomstick and it floated in the air as the hoop glowed in  fire, scorching the ground. "I have no need of you. I'll take my  leave and return to Jusenkyo. Pathetic land... urk..." The boy  was thrown to the ground as Genma jumped on the flying staff.</p><p>"Saotome! What do you think you're doing?" Cried out  Soun at the unwarranted attack on a small child by his friend.</p><p>"Jusenkyo! Here I come!" Genma leaned forward and the  staff moved straight for the compound wall. A smash and a martial  artist shaped hole marked his passing.</p><p>"You <b>FOOL!</b>" The boy screamed as he emerged from  the koi pond, dripping wet and angered beyond words. "You can't  control the power of the Kinjakan!" He threw down his bath items  and wings emerged from his back. He flapped his white feathery wings  and flew into the air to strike back at the fat man.</p><p>Genma was fighting with the Kinjakan, trying to learn how to steer  it and slowly got the hang of it. In moments, he understood how to  shift his girth to change course and grinned at his good fortune.  "Soon, I'll be in China and I can get rid of this curse that my  worthless son gave me. Maybe I'll even get some of the water to  settle a few debts. HA HA HA!" Thoughts of bottling Jusenkyo  water and selling it to the highest bidder filled his feeble little  mind. "I wonder how you sell stuff on eBay?"</p><p>"Get back here you infidel!" The regal looking boy  flapped harder, but he was no match for the speed of the Kinjakan. "I  will see to it personally that you're punished for this. Huff,  huff..." He gasped and developed a cramp in his wing from  exceeding his physical limits. "Argh!" He fell from the sky  and smashed into the top of a tall pine and held on as the tree swung  back and forth from the impact.</p><p>Mr. Saotome was having the time of his life. He was hundreds of  meters off the ground on a magical flying staff. A device that would  fetch a King's ransom once he accomplished his mission. He tilted the  staff upwards and flew west, toward China. The idiot was completely  oblivious to just how much trouble he had just put himself in.</p><p>Clutching the tree top, a boy that went by the name of Lord  Saffron glowed in anger. "I'll make sure you suffer for this  outrage."</p><p>Back at the Tendo residence, Kasumi shook her head sadly. "Father,  what are you going to do about this?"</p><p>In classic elegance, that only the patriarch of the Tendo clan can  accomplish, he fell to his knees and cried like a little girl.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Minako Aino stood tall in her P.E. uniform. She gently knocked on  the door of the coach's office and clasped her hands behind her back  while she patiently waited for the door to open. She tapped her foot.  She sweated a drop of water on her forehead. Screaming, she pummeled  the door with two fists, almost shattering the frosted glass that  separated her from the man who could save her team from utter  embarrassment. <b>"COACH! OPEN UP!"</b><p>"Hey! Quit it!" Came the exasperated voice from behind  the door. "Could you give me ten seconds before you try to break  my door down?" The coach's silhouette appeared behind the door's  window. "What now?"</p><p>He unlocked the door and a frazzled goddess of love pushed her way  in. "Coach, can you call Yuuki or Mariko and get them in here?"</p><p>"I would if I could." The coach let go of the doorknob  and turned to face his star player. "Yuuki's recovering and  Mariko's out of town."</p><p>The blond thought for a moment. Could Sailor Saturn stop by and  visit Yuuki? She growled in frustration. "Grrr..."</p><p>The tall dark haired man may have been a little slow on figuring  out things, but it didn't take him long to put two and two together.  "Who else is sick? Don't tell me Akane's out?"</p><p>"No, she's fine. She's down at the gym, practicing with the  rest of the team."</p><p>Giving a sigh of relief, the middle-aged teacher walked back to  his desk, sat in his chair, put his feet up and played with a foam  volleyball. "So, what's the emergency? With you, Akane and Ranko  playing, it doesn't matter who else is on the team. You three can  take care of just about anyone."</p><p>"Do you remember who we're playing against on Monday night?"</p><p>"Sure do. They've been wanting a rematch since that last  gaming disaster."</p><p>"And who do they want to play against, hmm?" Minako  crossed her arms, and emphasized her humming.</p><p>"Ranko of course. Their star player seems to have it in for  her." He caught the toy he was tossing and held it tight. "Don't  tell me."</p><p>Minako turned her head to the side. "Ranko's missing. Cancel  the game."</p><p>"Once, maybe, but not twice. We nearly went broke giving out  refunds the last time."</p><p>The young blond leaned forward and placed her hands on the table.  She shoved her face across the desk to get her point across. "Coach,  the only two members of our team who've ever played Martial Arts  Volleyball are Ranko and Akane. With those two, we can win, but if  one's missing, we're pancakes!"</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, to avoid the girl's battle aura, he  nearly lost his balance and grabbed the nearest thing he could to  keep from falling: Namely, Minako. Surprised by the extra weight on  her shoulders, she tumbled forward and both of them hit the floor.  Groaning, the teacher corrected his student. "It's toast, not  pancakes."</p><p>WHAM! Minako belted her teacher away from her since they were in a  compromising position. "Pervert!" She got up and dusted  herself off. "Call St. Hebereke's and cancel the game."</p><p>Rubbing his arm to soothe the pain from being punched, he picked  himself and his chair off the floor. "You know I can't do that."</p><p>"And why not?"</p><p>"Remember the last game we tried to have? The one where that  little freak showed up and ruined the gym?"</p><p>The girl shuddered. But then, the mere thought of Happosai would  make any sane woman tremble in fear.</p><p>"Well that little event cost us millions of yen in damages.  Kodachi's brother was gracious enough to pay for the repairs on one  condition. Kodachi made it very clear she wanted a rematch."</p><p>"You've GOT to be kidding me?" Minako shouted. The  players in the gym halted their practice to cover their ears.  "K-Kuno? Brother? As in Tatewaki?"</p><p>"Yeah, that's her brother's name"."</p><p>"You mean that lunatic who was on TV yesterday? You made a  deal like that with those people? What's wrong with you?"</p><p>The coach shot back. "Do you know how long it would have  taken to get the school board to fund the reconstruction? It's bad  enough that we're paying a fortune in insurance premiums because of  youma attacks. The lousy insurance company doesn't want to pay  because we didn't have a rider for crazed martial artists. So, it's  either play this game, with Ranko, or we can say goodbye to our  athletic program when they repossess the gymnasium."</p><p>"Oh, Ranko." Minako groaned.</p><p>"So, as captain of the team, you go find your teammate and  get her butt over here or else." He was red with anger. "And  don't you dare ask what I mean by 'or else'. You're not going to like  it."</p><p>A moment later, a door was slammed behind the blond volleyball  team captain. She twitched as the loud bang was heard and then she  held her head low. As she walked slowly to the gym, she tried to  think of excuses. "Maybe I could transform into Sailor V and  pretend there was a Youma attack. I could call in a bomb threat.  Maybe I could get hit by a truck? Nah, I wouldn't be so lucky."</p><p>HONK! A truck was barreling down the street that the girl had  absent-mindedly walked into. Her honed Senshi training allowed her to  jump out of the way, back onto the safety of the sidewalk. She  watched the truck speed off and then jumped up and down in fury. "I  could've had a perfect excuse! ARGH!"</p><p>Akane and the other volleyball team members spilled out of the gym  and ran down the path to the front of the school. There they found  their leader rapidly kicking the base of an innocent tree, showering  the area with leaves, twigs and the occasional squirrel. Usagi,  feeling genuine compassion for her angry friend, ran forward, slipped  on some loose twigs and planted her face into the ground. "Ouchie."</p><p>Minako saw Usagi's antics and it made her even angrier. She  started to punch the tree. "We... Are... Going... To... Suck..."</p><p>"What's going on?" Asked Akane, while staying just out  of arm's reach of the Senshi of Venus.</p><p>She stopped beating the tree, only to watch it collapse from all  of the abuse by snapping in two. She shook her open hands to dislodge  the bark particles and glared at Akane. "Where's Ranko?"</p><p>"Ranko? That idiot's off to who knows where and she won't  answer her phone. What's wrong? Tell me."</p><p>Minako smiled a feral grin. "I'll tell you. And after that,  you find her and you get her here by tonight or I'll personally  introduce her to Artemis. And you know how much she likes cats...  Heh, heh, heh..." She rubbed her hands together while  entertaining dark twisted thoughts involving felines, sulphuric acid  and a bulldozer.</p><p>The team shook in terror. Minako wasn't showing any signs that she  was kidding.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Amid the hustle and bustle that was the Narita International  Airport, a taxi screeched to a halt at curbside. The driver called  out. "International terminal, departure gate." He pointed  to his fare meter. "Who's buyin'?"<p>Ryoga sat dumbfounded. "Pay? I knew there had to be a catch."</p><p>Mousse extracted the proper amount of money and handed it to the  driver. "You've never taken a taxi before?"</p><p>"Why?" Ryoga crossed his arms in indignation. "I  get around fine without 'em."</p><p>"Let's go." Mousse opened the door and exited the right  side of the cab, straight into traffic.</p><p>"The blind, leading the lost." Ranko muttered. She  opened the left door and stopped Ryoga from joining Mousse's attempt  at real-life Frogger by yanking him toward the door nearest the  sidewalk.</p><p>The near-sighted martial artist felt strong gusts of wind as large  vehicles whizzed by within centimeters. "Strange, they're using  really big luggage carts."</p><p>The taxi driver tossed out Ryoga's backpack with great effort onto  the sidewalk and hopped back into his car. He sped off in search of  another fare, leaving Mousse standing alone in the road amid honking  trucks and taxis. Ranko ran over, grabbed him by the arm and tossed  him onto the sidewalk. "Are you deaf too? Yikes!" She  somersaulted into the air to avoid getting hit from a speeding sedan.</p><p>Ryoga put his backpack back on and scanned the crowd for any signs  of where he should be going. "Hmm." He spoke softly, "have  I been here before?"</p><p>Ranko, after landing next to him, grabbed his shirt sleeve to keep  him from wandering away, replied. "Is there any place you hadn't  been to?"</p><p>"Uh..." He laughed and scratched behind his head. "Let  me think about that."</p><p>"How'd I let them talk me into this?" Ranko rolled her  eyes to the sky for a moment. There were too many witnesses, so she  couldn't just beat these two into unconsciousness, then transform,  then teleport their sorry butts to Jusenkyo. Even if she did teleport  them, they'd ask too many questions and they'd probably get lost even  if she left a trail of bread crumbs and erected a neon sign that said  "Spring of Drowned Man, jump here." No, she was cursed to  lead these two to the magical springs if she wanted to clear her  conscience of being to blame or partially to blame for their curses.</p><p>Mousse happily exclaimed. "The next flight leaves in two  hours."</p><p>"How'd ya know that?" Asked Ranko, suspicious that  Mousse might have been reading the wrong flight information and was  taking them to Moscow. She breathed a sigh of relief at seeing he was  actually wearing his glasses while spying a monitor for outgoing  flights.</p><p>"China Airlines has a flight to Bejing. Once we get there, we  take a connection to the airport near Jusenkyo."</p><p>Ryoga was even more dumbfounded than before, maybe because in the  matters of travel, he was just dumb. "There's an airport near  Jusenkyo?"</p><p>"Well, it's not really that close. We'll still have to travel  two hundred kilometers. But it beats walking all the way from the  capital." With that, he led the trio into the terminal building  and toward the ticket counter. Ranko kept an eye out for  misdirections, Ryoga's attempts at going the wrong way, or another  fiancee.</p><p>A pretty attendant smiled at the myopic man. "Yes, Sir. How  may I help you?"</p><p>"I need three tickets to Beijing please." Mousse fumbled  around looking for his cash.</p><p>"Excellent, Sirs. May I please see your travel documents?"  She held out her hand expectantly. "Do you have any baggage to  check in?"</p><p>Mousse produced his Chinese passport and handed it to the woman  behind the counter. "Okay, guys. Give her your passports."</p><p>Ryoga and Ranko shot a glance at each other and asked in total  befuddlement. "Passports?"</p><p>"Oh, oh..." Mousse softly spoke as his plan began to  unravel before it had even begun. "What do you mean, passports?  How did you two get to China?"</p><p>Ranko answered. "I swam."</p><p>Ryoga held his fingers together and tapped them nervously. "I  don't really know."</p><p>Now it was Mousse's turn to get upset. "You mean to tell me  that neither of you has a passport?"</p><p>Ranko shot back. "Why would I need one? It's not like I could  ever afford anything. My pop's always had us hitch a ride or  somethin'."</p><p>The lost one kept tapping his index fingers together. "What's  a passport for, anyways?"</p><p>The attendant became impatient. "Sirs, I require your travel  documents before I can book your flight. Sir, Miss, if you've  misplaced your papers you need to go home and retrieve them or  contact your government office and have new ones issued. You cannot  travel to China without proper passports and visas."</p><p>"Visa?" Ryoga brightened up. "I've got one of  those." He took off his massive backpack and rummaged around for  it.</p><p>Mousse felt a bit better. "Now we're getting somewhere. You  don't happen to have a visa as well, Saotome?"</p><p>Ranko watched Ryoga expectantly. "As if."</p><p>Ryoga produced a small plastic card with the word "Visa"  written on it. "Here it is. Is this what you're looking for?"</p><p>The ticket lady looked at the card and nodded. "Yes, we take  Visa as a form of payment. But I still need to see your passport."</p><p>"But you said I needed a visa." Ryoga looked down at the  credit card his wife gave him.</p><p>Mousse wanted to cry, scream and curse at the gods who were  messing with his head. "No! She meant a tourist visa, you idiot!  You get one of those when you go to the Chinese consulate. Argh!  You've both been to China and you don't have any passports! What're  we going to do now?"</p><p>Ranko had a plan, but it required a beating, a mini-skirt and  blowing her cover. She liked the part about the beating, but the  other parts she could do without. She declined to mention it. She  came up with another plan, one based on a more favored method of  travel her father preferred. "I've got an idea."</p><p>Mousse retrieved his passport from the attendant. "Now I'm  scared."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Mrs. Saotome entered the apartment with two small bags of  groceries, one in each arm. Her children had healthy appetites and  required frequent trips to the store to keep the kitchen from  emptying out of foodstuffs. She placed the plastic bags filled with  the ingredients for tonight's meal on the tiny kitchen table and in  response, the phone rang. She took a moment to rest, straighten her  hair and picked up the receiver to answer the phone in a cheery  voice. "Saotome residence."<p>Akane was at a pay phone in the courtyard of Juuban High School  with Minako standing next to her. The blond was sweating profusely  from nervousness and rambled on, waving her hands in frustration. "I  could say that we got sick. No, they'd want a doctor's note. I know,  a youma attacked Ranko. No, Usagi would want to strike back and that  would only make it worse. Maybe the school bus got lost. No, this is  a home game."</p><p>As Miss Aino went on creating excuses to cancel the game, Akane  asked her mother the question that was on everyone's mind at the  moment. Where's Ranko? "Mother, has Ranko stopped by the  apartment?"</p><p>"Ranko?" She paused. "No, Dear, why would she stop  by? Isn't she at school with you?"</p><p>"No, Mother, she's not here." She sighed at the  disappointing news. She spied a glimpse at her volleyball captain as  she held her arms close to her chest and her head tilted back, as if  the clouds above had the answer she sought. The girl continued to  babble with no one around listening to her disjointed sentences about  meteor strikes or nuclear war. Akane cupped her hand on the phone to  block out the extra noise. "Well, she met up with Ryoga and  Mousse, you remember them, and went somewhere." Akane tapped  Makoto on the upper arm to get her attention. "Mako-chan, did  you hear where exactly did Ranko say she was going?"</p><p>Makoto was consoling her Senshi teammate from her own blubbering.  She bit her lip as she recalled those few minutes of that odd  encounter with the white robed man and the boy who kept trying to  attack Ranko. "It was some weird sounding place." She  sucked on her lower lip for a moment, then remembered. "Jusenkyo,  I think."</p><p>"Are you sure?" Akane screamed out, almost shattering  the windows nearby. "She's going to China? Why that idiot! Why  did she go and do that for?"</p><p>"The guy in the white robes was saying something about being  a real man and it got her really mad. Wait a minute, you don't  suppose?"</p><p>Akane got pale. After everything they had been though, her husband  would still let insults to her manhood get the better of her. She had  to find her quick before she did something monumentally stupid. She  spoke into the phone again. "Mom, are you sure that Ranko didn't  come home? Maybe to get her backpack or camping stuff?"</p><p>Nodoka twiddled with the phone cord, wondering what sort of  trouble her child had gotten herself into this time. "Give me a  moment and I'll check." She hurried over to the tiny closet and  slid the door open. Instantly, a wall of clothes, bokkens and other  assorted items fell out, narrowly missing the Saotome matriarch.  Sitting among the pile were two backpacks, one belonging to Akane,  the other belonging to Ranma. She tip toed over the pile of clothes,  back to the kitchen. "No, she hasn't been home. Her backpack is  still here."</p><p>"Thank you, Mother." Akane hung up the phone and found  herself shoved against a cold stone wall by an extremely psychotic  blond.</p><p>The madwoman's eyes were unnaturally wide open and she howled her  words to alert the planet of her displeasure. "She's not  there? Akane, you go find her and bring her back, you hear! If you  don't, there will be hell to pay!" Minako curled up into a ball  and mumbled to herself about the odds of the sun going supernova in  the next six hours.</p><p>Makoto whispered. "It's the end of the world."</p><p>Usagi, who had been quiet all this time, gasped at Makoto's  statement. "W-what do you mean, Mako-chan?"</p><p>The tall girl answered. "Mina-chan didn't screw up a  proverb."</p><p>The moon princess took a step back in fright. "It really is  the end of the world."</p><p>"Oh, please." Akane shook her head at Minako's mindless  chatter. "If Mousse is taking her to China, it'll be over his  dead body." She nodded her head with an idea. "I know just  where to start looking. See you!" With that, she ran off to the  locker room to change into street clothes.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>In the northern part of Tokyo, a patron stopped at a small ramen  shop to get his lunch, only to find the front door locked. The Cat  Cafe's windows were shut and a small "Closed" sign hung  slightly lopsided on the doorknob. He shrugged and went on his way,  leaving a girl in an okonomiyaki seller's outfit alone to fume. She  wasn't going to let this barricade stop her from getting some  answers. The young woman reached over her shoulder and unhooked her  giant spatula. She held it ready in one hand to deliver some strikes  on the residents if they didn't explain things to her satisfaction.  She knocked on the door with a little more force than a simple  greeting would require.<p>The wind picked up and a few scraps of paper fluttered by while  Ukyou made a mental inventory of the condition of her competition's  place of business. Curtains drawn, menus missing, closed sign  displayed and no irritating bicycle riding Chinese bimbo were all  clues that no one was home. The chef peered into the window, trying  to see if she could spot someone inside. Thoughts of Cologne and  Shampoo cooking up some new concoction danced in her head and  darkened her imagination. Angry, she rapped on the door with the  business end of her weapon and with almost enough force to break it  down. "Hey! I know you're in there. I need to talk to you. NOW!"</p><p>Only silence answered as she waited for a few minutes before  taking a new tack. She was about to kick in the front door when she  remembered there was an entrance in the back. Not wanting to be  accused of imitating one of Shampoo's worst habits, she holstered her  weapon and casually walked down the side alley to the back of the  building.</p><p>There Ukyou bumped into an old friend. "Akane?"</p><p>Akane was gasping for air from her cross-town run and held her arm  out against the back wall of the Cat Cafe for support. She replied.  "Ukyou, what're you doing here?"</p><p>"I was goin' to ask you the same thing, Sugar." She  noted that the back screen door was closed but appeared to be free of  dust. It was a good sign that someone was home. "What're you  doin' here? Shouldn't you be in school?"</p><p>Suspicious, Akane shot back. "I've..." Gasping, she  continued. "I've got to see Mousse. Why aren't you in school?"</p><p>"I've got to talk to Cologne. What do you wanna talk to  Mousse for?"</p><p>Akane took a deep breath, held it for a moment, then exhaled while  speaking so she could talk normally. "Ranma's late for  volleyball practice and I'm here to get him."</p><p>Ukyou blinked. "Huh? He's in Nerima to play volleyball? With  Mousse? When did they start playing?"</p><p>"She." Akane spoke a little louder on the pronoun, then  regained control of her breathing. "She's been playing with the  Juuban team for weeks now. We've got a big game coming up."</p><p>"And what's this got to do with Duck Boy here?" Ukyou  pointed her spatula at the restaurant for a moment.</p><p>"Mousse conned Ranma into something." Akane went to the  back door to open it.</p><p>"Wait just a sec' Sugar. I got here first."</p><p>"So? After I pull Ranma out of here, I'm going home. You can  talk to Cologne all you want."</p><p>"I'm asking the questions first." Ukyou gave a cold  stare.</p><p>Akane stared back. "I'm getting my husband first."</p><p>Ukyou winced at the word 'Husband'. "Not before I get some  answers!"</p><p>"I'm talking to them first!"</p><p>Ukyou glowed. "I'm talking to them!"</p><p>Akane summoned a mallet. "NO! ME!"</p><p>Ukyou summoned a bigger mallet. "NO! ME!"</p><p>Akane's mallet stretched into a much larger size. "BACK OFF!"</p><p>Ukyou's mallet grew even larger. "MAKE ME!"</p><p>In the doorway, attracted by the angry shouts of two girls  arguing, Shampoo's father stood, silently watching the display. He  became cold as he recognized the pair as the two who were directly  responsible for his daughter's disgrace. He smiled at the sight of  them preparing for a duel to the death. If they killed each other,  then there was hope for his little girl after all.</p><p>Akane's mallet was at forty kilos and rising. She struggled to  maintain her grip on it as it was still expanding. "IF YOU  INSIST!"</p><p>Ukyou's mallet shifted in shape into a wooden battle spatula. She  raised it above her shoulder to deliver a swing. "OH, I INSIST!"</p><p>Ukyou and Akane faced each other in righteous fury. They needed  answers and they needed them now. They growled, one holding a wooden  battle spatula, the other holding a mallet. Lightning sparked from  their eyes and met in the middle, making a small light show that  frightened Mr. Xian.</p><p>Akane, not taking her eyes off of Ukyou, spoke loudly in the  elder's direction. "Mousse took Ranma to Jusenkyo. How do I get  there?"</p><p>Ukyou, mirroring Akane's gaze, tone and stance, asked a similar  question. "Where'd Kiima take Konatsu?"</p><p>Shampoo's father stood back, dismayed that they declared a truce  instead of cutting each other to ribbons. He shouted back, anger  built up from everything that had gone wrong today. Despite his urge  to tell the girls to jump into a cursed spring, he answered their  questions. All Amazon males were taught to obey the females without  hesitation. "You, Violent Girl, that dishonorable boy took the  store's money to go after my daughter in China. I hope you make him  suffer."</p><p>Ukyou frowned at not hearing her answer first. She glared daggers  of ice from her cold gaze at the middle aged man.</p><p>Mr. Xain continued, not wanting to spend any more time in their  presence than necessary. "You, Spatula Girl, Kiima's a soldier  of Phoenix Mountain. If you want to know anything more, you'll have  to see her yourself. Now, if I may take my leave of you, I have to  find someone to help me run this store."</p><p>Akane's anger subsided and her mallet shrank in response.  Incredulous at the accusation, she recalled all of the things Mousse  had done and it made sense that he could have resorted to crime.  Mousse had stooped to some very underhanded tactics to win over  Shampoo and thievery was something he was capable of. "Mousse  robbed you?"</p><p>"That's what I said. What? You no listen?" He spoke from  behind the screen door, hoping that if they attacked, it would offer  him some thin measure of protection. "He took over six hundred  thousand yen; all money in the register and the safe. He will have to  answer for his crimes."</p><p>Akane's eyebrow twitched. "Give me the directions to the  springs."</p><p>Ukyou interrupted. "Where's this Phoenix Mountain?"</p><p>He shook his head in frustration. "One at a time! Spatula  Girl, Phoenix Mountain is one hundred kilometers from my village in  China. You will find it beyond Jusendo Falls." He wanted to  continue the sentence with a warning, but the fact that the Phoenix  Mountain people didn't like humans visiting them and usually killed  them on sight, pleased him. If she went there and had a tragic  accident, it would solve one of Shampoo's problems.</p><p>Ukyou's spatula mallet shimmered and vanished. "Where's this  village of yours. I need a map so I can get to this Phoenix  Mountain."</p><p>Akane instinctively shouldered her mallet, not noticing that the  weapon shouldn't even exist. She repeated herself to get her own  answers. "I need a map to Jusenkyo." She growled. "Now."</p><p>"Give me a moment. I'll be right back." Mr. Xian left  the back door and went into the room he shared with Mousse. He looked  at Mousse's things in disgust, hating the boy even more. He agreed  with his daughter's assessment that the hidden weapons master was an  unfit suitor and his actions in courting her only strengthened his  resolve to make sure that the boy never became Shampoo's husband. The  man sat at a small desk and proceeded to draw a map of the area  around his village when a idea sprung into his mind. Acting on it, he  crumpled up the paper and with a new sheet of paper, drew a new map  with a few minor changes. Satisfied with the results, he went back to  deliver on his promise.</p><p>Ukyou stood, arms crossed and very impatient. "Took you long  enough."</p><p>He unlocked and opened the door to see the two walking corpses one  last time. He held out the map for Ukyou to take, but Akane snatched  it. "You are Violent Girl. Follow the trail to Jusendo. There  you'll find Jusenkyo beyond the ridge at the base of Mount Phoenix."</p><p>Ukyou studied the map over Akane's shoulder. Seeing the little  drawing of a mountain marked Mount Phoenix with the Jusenkyo springs  at its base, but no other landmarks like the location of Kiima's  home, she asked. "Where is Kiima's village?"</p><p>"There is a trail clearly marked at the bottom of the  mountain. Follow it to the summit and there you'll find who you  seek." Mr. Xian silently added, "if you live that long."</p><p>"Thank you." Akane bowed. "You've been most  helpful."</p><p>Ukyou bowed as well. "Thank you for the map. Oh, and you may  want to post want ads around Furinkan High School. There's some  students there that could use a part time job."</p><p>They were being helpful and polite? Mr. Xian was confused. All of  the stories he had heard about Ranma's fiancees were that they were  the spawn of demons and devils. His encounter at first only  reinforced that belief, but now, he was beginning to have his doubts.</p><p>Ukyou secretly hoped that Sailor Io would make an appearance and  just beam them there. Thinking that was the best way to travel, she  held Akane's hand and tugged her away from Mr. Xian's hearing range.  "So, Akane. Got a ride to China? Can you teleport?"</p><p>"No, I can't. Ranma was the only one who could do that."</p><p>"What about the others? Maybe we could hitch a ride with  them?"</p><p>Akane debated about it. She thought about calling Usagi and the  others to do a Sailor Teleport, but the risk of exposing who they  were to Ukyou was too great. Ukyou knew who Akane and Ranma were as  Sailors, but not the rest, and they'd already missed too much school  as it was. No, this was going to have to be her job and hers alone.  Besides, Ranma's just in China, so how much trouble could there be?  "No, not really."</p><p>Ukyou pondered her options. "Hey, do you have travel papers  to China?"</p><p>The Tendo shrugged. "Yeah."</p><p>"Well, Sugar. Today's your lucky day. Follow me." Ukyou  ran off to the street and raised her hand in the air. "Taxi!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"It's a good thing that we made this flight." Ukyou  shoved her backpack into the overhead compartment. "And I'm glad  I was able to check my stuff in as baggage."<p>Akane buckled her seat belt. "Yeah, and to think that they  had a last minute cancellation. This flight looks like it's  completely booked." She glanced at their seats and noticed that  there were three instead of two. "Looks like we've got a little  extra space."</p><p>Ukyou took a moment to sit in her seat and buckle up. A thought  crossed her mind. "Hey, I've got to ask. Why did you have your  passport in your school bag?"</p><p>Akane couldn't stifle a giggle. "When you've been kidnapped  and flown to China with no notice, you learn to be prepared for  anything."</p><p>Ukyou nodded. "This was that Prince Kirin thing wasn't it?"</p><p>The former Tendo laughed. "Yeah, that and when Kuno stranded  us on Prince Toma's island. Remember all the hassle we got from  Immigration when we got back to Japan?"</p><p>"How could I forget? Nabiki was shameless in that dress of  hers. She just did a twirl and walked right past the drooling  officers."</p><p>Akane brought back the memory of her sister Nabiki wearing the  very revealing outfit she got while she was also kidnapped with the  rest of the girls to be a bride of the pint-sized Prince Toma. She,  strutting her stuff and enjoying every minute of it brought a real  smile on the short haired girl's face. "She knows how to get  what she wants, doesn't she? Anyways, after that, I got my passport  and keep it handy. Looks like it paid off."</p><p>The interior of the plane darkened as the pilot prepared for take  off. "So Ranchan's got his passport too?"</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes. "No, the dummy doesn't even understand  what a passport is." She paused for a moment. "With his  ability to teleport, I don't think he really needs one."</p><p>Ukyou relaxed in her seat as the plane accelerated and lifted into  the air. "I hope you're okay Ko-chan."</p><p>"Ranma, you idiot." Akane whispered with worry. "Don't  do something stupid."</p><p>"Y'know, Akane. I can't shake the feeling that Ranchan's  nearby."</p><p>Akane rested her head against the armrest and tried to block out  Ukyou's pining for her husband. She too, felt the same inside and  didn't understand why.</p><p>Down below, inside of a wheel well in the undercarriage of the  plane, were a red-haired girl, a duck and a pig. The girl held onto a  metal strut for support and pressed her small body into a narrow  cavity. The wind threatened to suck the trio out but they tightened  their grip until the plane was in the air, the gear retracted and the  outer door was sealed shut.</p><p>"Bwee?" Asked the pig.</p><p>"Yep," Ranko answered. "This was how pops and I got  back to Japan."</p><p>"Quack?" The duck was curious about something.</p><p>"Pops? He was in another wheel well. I've got no idea how he  fit his fat butt in one of these things." She looked around the  dark cold chamber that was going to be her home for the next few  hours. "But then, pops was always full of surprises. Too bad  he's not coming, he'd love a chance to get a cure." Ranko  happily spawned an idea. "Maybe I can ship a barrel of  Nannichuan home to him."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Was it daylight out? Shampoo had no idea. Her cell was a deep pit,  dug into the earth with a straw lid six meters above covering the  opening and blocking out almost all of the light. The little cat  could see somewhat in the darkness but that gave her little comfort.  She licked herself to clean her fur. They may have taken her freedom,  but they didn't take away her self-respect.<p>A half-eaten rat sat a meter away from the purple feline. A symbol  of how low her own people felt she had fallen. She wasn't worthy of  human food anymore. She was nothing more than an animal to them. A  beast, only fit for a pet or perhaps the slaughterhouse.</p><p>She placed her paws forward and laid her body down in sorrow. They  didn't tell her what crimes she was imprisoned for, but she had a  good idea.</p><p>The first time she had ever left her village to go out into the  world beyond, was to pursue a red-haired girl and fulfill her promise  to kill her. By strict Amazon tradition, she gave and fully intended  to make good on the kiss of death; the promise to hunt down her prey  to the ends of the Earth and slay her.</p><p>Fate had decided to play a dirty trick on her. She found that her  target wasn't a girl at all, but a Jusenkyo cursed man. Her law was  clear on that subject as well. If defeated by an outsider male; she  became honor bound to bring him into the tribe.</p><p>He not only had defeated her once, but by her own foolishness, he  defeated her again in the defense of Akane. What could she do? She  saw him as the perfect male yet he was also the woman she had to  destroy. She had no choice but to run home and beg the elders for  guidance.</p><p>It was at that dreaded council meeting that her future was set. As  punishment for not ending the life of Ranma Saotome, she was to train  at Jusenkyo and accept whatever punishment the springs deemed fit to  doom her with.</p><p>The little kitty wanted to cry, but cats didn't have tear ducts.  It didn't help lessen her pain as she found that her new form all but  guaranteed that her Airen would never choose her. He loathed cats and  she became one with just a small amount of cold water. In the  darkness, she sighed at the sight of her purple and white paws. These  were once the hands of a warrior, one of the best. A champion among  champions only to be humiliated by a boy and his stupid father.</p><p>Shampoo closed her eyes to push away the sight of the cursed body  that the man she loved could never tolerate. She hated herself. She  had only one thought, something she couldn't say in her feline body,  but wished with all of her heart would come true. "Please kill  me, I deserve nothing less."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The lone warrior leaned against her walking stick. Weary from  battle, she made her painful way forward, away from the battlefield  to what she hoped was a safe haven. The terrain was unfamiliar and it  scared her deep inside. She paused her journey for a moment to rest.  Holding the bamboo pole tight, she shifted her weight onto it to give  her legs a much needed rest.<p>Her ninja garb was on its last legs. She watched helplessly as the  last thread holding the large patch on her knee of her loose cotton  pants gave out and the square piece of cloth fell off and landed  silently on the dirt path below. She wanted to bend down to pick up  the patch, in the hopes that soon she'd have an opportunity to sew it  back on. But that would have required her to bend over, and that was  an action she wasn't capable of performing at the moment without  aggravating the wounds on her back.</p><p>The girl was a sorry sight. Blood stains covered her tattered  kunoichi outfit, her sword was lost, and she herself looked liked she  had been dragged by a rope from the back of a train for five  kilometers. Her once beautiful hair was burnt and matted with dried  mud. Only her face had survived the ordeal intact sans makeup. She  would have to apply some once she was able to make it to a town and  beg for some from the local townsfolk.</p><p>Looking ahead at the horizon, she saw the path she was on  continued for a kilometer and disappeared over the top of a small  hill. At that peak, there was a primitive looking hut. With renewed  vigor, she stepped forward nearly tumbling to the ground as her  walking stick refused to move for an instant before she was able to  yank it out of the soft earth. A hut meant people. People meant  civilization. Civilization meant sanctuary.</p><p>Glancing back at the sky, it appeared that her way was clear. The  kunoichi took another painful step, then another. Using the bamboo  pole as a third leg, she kept up her slow pace, moving ever so slowly  ahead. Using the image of the hut as a attainable goal, she sallied  forth. Her warrior's heart told her that her very survival hinged on  getting to that hut before her enemies found her and finished the job  they had failed to do.</p><p>Her mission was everything to her. She had to make this work.  Failure was never part of her vocabulary and she had no intention of  learning the meaning of that word today, or ever. She rubbed her  brown eyes as a slight gust blew dust into her face, but she refused  to slow down.</p><p>Only five hundred meters kept her from a meal and a bed. She felt  dizzy as her body had begun to give out from over exertion. Through  sheer will alone, she coaxed her leg muscles to keep moving, each  step taking more and more effort feeling like she was waist deep in a  winter snow and forcing forward movement into a snowbank that was  chest high.</p><p>Her vision became blurred. She wasn't exactly sure if she was  still going in the right direction but she still moved on. She  couldn't let them get her. Not now, not when she was so close to  salvation. She thought she heard something. It was... It was...</p><p>"Halt! Who goes there?" Cried out an amazon sentry. She  held a bo staff ready. The teenaged orange haired girl, wearing a  light green Chinese pantsuit, walked slowly to the fallen girl. She  called out to her companion back in the hut. "Get over here!"</p><p>Another sentry approached. She was in her forties but she looked  far younger than her true age. Her golden locks fell below her waist  and her emerald eyes had a look of wisdom that was far older than she  was. "Who is she? She's not from here."</p><p>The young Amazon poked the ninja garbed woman and got no response.  She touched her backside in several places, softly at first, then  with some force to pinch. She retracted her staff and placed her  fingertips on the girl's neck to check for a pulse. "She's  alive. Barely. What should we do?"</p><p>The elder weighed her options for a moment. "She's a warrior. No doubt about that. We'll take her to the village. The elders will decide her fate."</p><p>The young warrior nodded in reply and lifted the semiconscious girl over her shoulder and carried her away.</p><p>It was dusk when the girl reached the border of the village with her heavy load. The amazon's years of training had paid off as she easily held her burden all the way up to the healer's hut. There she placed the black haired girl on a soft mattress.</p><p>Potion came out from behind the curtain that separated the front receiving area from her living quarters. She made a quick glance at her new patient. "Who's this?"</p><p>Bending down on one knee and bowing in respect, the warrior answered. "I don't know. She arrived at the west guard post in this condition."</p><p>The short old woman coughed. The kunoichi's odor was filling the room with an unclean stench. "I'll need you help me remove her garments and wash her down." She held her nose and lifted up a piece of fabric from the girl's sleeve. "I think we make have to burn these."</p><p>"As you wish." The orange haired girl bowed again. She went to a small cabinet by the entrance of the hut and extracted a small bucket and washing supplies.</p><p>Potion stood next to the low mattress and used her fingers to open the kunoichi's eyes. Getting a good look at the weak girl's face, she recognized that she was Japanese and not Chinese. Speaking in perfect Japanese, the healer asked. "And just who might you be, child?"</p><p>She weakly answered. "Kunoichi, Konatsu, lies before you..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Author's Notes: Please review my story.
