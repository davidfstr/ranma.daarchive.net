</div>Ranma/ Tekken<br/>'A Warring Concience'<p>"Nihao, Ranma," both girls chirped, their voices much more cheerful and lively than their appearance.<p>Ranma winced slightly, her father definitely put them through the ringer, "Hey, how you two doing?"<p>"Oh, is fine, Ranma," both of them sat down on each side of Ranma on the porch steps, flanking her, and then leaning their heads against her shoulders, "We so tired. Ranma father make us work too, too hard."<p>Both girls sighed in unison, as Ranma wrapped her wings around them, "You can rest now, I wouldn't mind, if you like." It didn't take much for them to cuddle tighter to her, and begin to drift off. Within her wings, Ranma wrapped her arms around the two overworked girls, enjoying their contentful faces as they indulged in the secure aura that the angel radiated, and idly wondered if she had ever worn that expression in her young life.<p>"Akane, what was that all about?" one of the youngest Tendou's classmates asked her, as the teacher had her back to them while lecturing.<p>"Hmm?"<p>"What did you do to those boys? Was it some secret martial arts technique?"<p>"Why would you think that?"<p>The girl's expression grew slightly shocked, "I mean... they just... stopped when you told them to!"<p>"And why wouldn't they? I mean I don't think I ever asked them to," Akane replied with slight mirth.<p>"I guess... What about those Angel and Devil Cosplayers? Who were they, anyway?"<p>Akane almost chuckled; of course, the whole school would find some excuse to dismiss the surreal yet infinitely serene and comforting feeling that a true angel amongst them would bring. That didn't upset Akane at all, for Ranma was now her own personal sun that kept her warm in the dead of fall. She could barely wait for school to get out so that she could get back to the redheaded heavenly being. It wasn't exactly torture, per say to be away from her, but it felt as if she were missing something, only recognized by the numbness of the spot in her heart it would be.<p>"Oh, she was only going to be around for a day or so, I'll let her know you missed her, though."<p>"What about the devil guy? His costume was awesome, truly scary!"<p>"Hopefully, we won't see him again," Akane chirped in a sanguine tone that did not match her message.<p>"You know? You sure seem happy today..." another girl enquired. Akane tilted her head before responding.<p>"It's going to be a good day."<p>Nabiki found it difficult to focus on class, concerning herself instead with the memory of waking up with Ranma in her arms. It felt so *right*, just as her forgivness did. Nabiki smiled even brighter; Ranma had given her forgivness! Sure, she like to play jokes on her siblings and friends, but sometimes seemingly harmless pranks or small schemes to get money added up to a great deal of angst for others involved, and Nabiki occasionally allowed the thought to cross her mind that because of this, she may not be the good person she considered herself.<p>Normally, she disregarded her self-doubt, and continued with her life; deciding that it had no impact on her now, or would it in the future. Suddenly, the possible future arrived on her doorstep, and left her questioning every single negative judgement she had ever made in her life.<p>The feelings Ranma brought out within her forced her to confront notions she precariously disregarded as religous nonsense. She knew her older sister Kasumi was a practiced Christian, like their mother was, so she had a bit of knowlege of the practice. The emotions, the feelings that she experienced whenever she was around the presumed angel, in her opinion, could not be faked in the least. That was with even resisting the urge to prostate herself before the Heavenly spector. It was a Herculean feat of will for her to even keep ignoring Ranma as she did, and even then, she found herself drawn back to her like dehydrated man to a fresh oasis in the Sahara; she just found immense relief being near Ranma.<p>When Ranma told her that she held no ill will to her, it was like darkness wiped clean from her soul. She had never felt so uplifted, so refreshed in her life that she had to cry, she had to give into the infinite well of joyous emotions that overflowed throught her whole being, and at the time, it felt like nothing else in the world existed but her, Ranma, and forgiveness.<p>Now, she was removed from those emotions that forced her intellectual mind into temporary submission, and she pondered exactly what it was that Ranma did to her, Akane, and possibly those two girls that came with her. It was a loss of independance, almost. As if she would accept Ranma without question into her heart, and challenge anyone that would bring ill or harm to the angel.<p>It's hard for her to break from her cynical nature, but she had to wonder if the nature of Ranma was benevolent, or malevolent. Whichever it was, Nabiki had the looming suspicion that either way, she and everyone else involved may be facing a trial that will test the very nature of their spirits and resolves.<p>Akane arrived home, and didn't even bother to announce her presence, as she immidiately saught Ranma out. She found the angel sitting on the porch with her wings enveloping herself and her two bodyguards. Ranma-chan's head perked up, and she turned a smile towards Akane in greeting. The youngest Tendou sister walked onto the back porch, and kneeled behind Ranma, giving her a light hug around the neck.<p>"So, how was school?" Ranma asked, patting Akane's arm lightly.<p>The raven-haired girl noted the two peacefully sleeping girls, "It was... better. They're asleep at this time of day?"<p>"My father put them through the wringer this morning. They've been out for almost four hours."<p>"Ranma, isn't that uncomfortable?" Akane asked with a slight incredulous tone.<p>"I don't mind," Ranma replied serenely, before turning to look at the two girls snuggled against her, "I don't mind one bit."<p>Akane got a micheivous grin on her face, "How about one more?" She then quickly moved around Ranma, pried her wings open from the front, and leaned the back of her head against Ranma's stomach before the other girl could reply. instead of any words, Ranma simply chuckled, and stroked Akane's long hair.<p>"If you insist."<p>"Ranma."<p>Ranma sighed, and motioned Akane to stay where she was, "Yes, father?"<p>"Do you intend to practice today, or are you going to laze about?"<p>"We can spar in a little bit, I promise."<p>"If you must," Genma walked back into the house without further reply.<p>"How can your father be so cold to you?" Akane asked, almost yawning.<p>"I... it's not his fault. He's trying to deal with me the best he can. I still love him, and I hope he knows that."<p>"Is there anyone you *don't* love?" Akane asked with a slight giggle, snuggling herself closer to Ran Ran's side within Ranma's embrace.<p>"I... no, no there isn't," Ranma replied with a chagrined tone, before her voice became something more suited for reciting the most uplifting of poetry, written with Heaven's stars upon the black canvas of the night, "There's just such beauty in everything and everyone that I cannot bring myself to feel any ill nature to anything. I hope this doesn't make it seem to you that my love for you is trivial."<p>"It doesn't, not at all," Akane replied, as if she had thought about the question heavily, and found the answer extremely surprising to her awe, "It's like you can't be anything but sincere to me!"<p>"I guess," Ranma replied, a bit tersely, not that Akane even caught the tone.<p>"Mmm, I see why they...*yawn*... were asleep here for so long."<p>"They're all so content..." Ranma thought to herself, but out loud, she said, "Yeah..."<p>Ranma missed her training appointment with her father.<p>"Oh, hello, Nabiki," Kasumi greeted, as her sister walked into the kitchen.<p>"Sis, why do you avoid Ranma all the time? I know why last night, but you still seem like you're scared to death of her."<p>Kasumi stopped what she was doing, and bowed her head, "She's... she's a real angel, Nabiki."<p>"Well, we've already established that," Nabiki replied in a sardonic tone, "what is it that's bothering you about her, really?"<p>"She's..." the eldest Tendou daughter gripped the cross under her blouse with her free hand, "Mother was taken away from us by angels..."<p>Nabiki blinked at the reply, "Uh, you're not blaming Ranma, are you?"<p>"Oh, no, I couldn't do that," Kasumi replied avidly, "she just... makes me so uncomfortable. For so long, I wore this cross because mother gave it to me. She told me that I should wear it, and pray for her when the angels came to take her to heaven."<p>A shiny sliver splashed against the kitchen counter, "They took her from us, they didn't even let us say goodbye to her that night. Since then, I've had to ask myself, why would Mommy believe in a religion that would take her from us? Why didn't they take us? Why..." Kasumi quieted, as she and Nabiki felt the presence.<p>"Maybe because it was her time, and it was not yours," Ranma answered, "I'm sorry, I was on my way upstairs, and I stopped by. I'll be going, now."<p>"You know? She'll forgive you, if you ask," Nabiki stated softly to her sister.<p>Kasumi gripped the cross tighter, "I'm not ready, yet."<p>Nabiki nodded. She was surprised at the confession her sister made. She had always thought Kasumi was stern in her practices; to hear her say she's even questioned it, had her re-evaluating her older sister. Christian religion one of the few things Nabiki remembered her Mother by, as she would tell them stories from the bible when they were younger; explaining the morals of each story to them. Their father was Shinto-Buddhist, so he didn't typically share her opinions, not that he didn't love her any less, but it made it something that made up the person their mother was. Nabiki thought Kasumi practiced it for their mother, which she did, but even a slight challenge to it by her older sister made Kasumi more... herself suddenly, than their late parent.<p>"Sis..." Nabiki stated, meaning the word more than she had in a long time. She reached around, and hugged her older sister lightly, "We all have had our doubts, but when you're ready, I think Ranma will listen."<p>Kasumi nodded, but didn't turn around.
