</div>::listening to Utada Hikaru's 'Deep River'::<br/>Man, this song's beautiful!<p>_<p>Ranma/ Tekken<br/>'A Warring Concience'<br/>Part 6<p>Ranma sat outside, gazing at the reflection of the night stars in the fish pond, occationally disturbed when one if its inhabitants came to the surface in search of sustenance. The angel gave off her own dim white hue that in appearance was much more soothing than the light of the porch or the streetlights. If felt, it was like soothing summer warmth after an unbearable winter. It was that very 'glow' that brought a sullen expression to the red-headed angel's face; it didn't escape her attention that Akane instantly felt she wanted... needed to be closer to her, a feeling Ranma couldn't help but want to reciprocate, as it was her nature. Nabiki seemed strong, but the occational moment of weakness was becoming more and more common since she had met the Tendou family. Possibly soon, she would be as deeply entrenched as her younger sister was with feelings for their guest.<p>Kasumi did all she could to avoid Ranma, not that she could blame the girl. Kasumi always seemed deeply shaken when she was in the room with her. The way she clutched the cross that Ranma could see just barely hidden in her blouse had shown Ranma just how much her appearance had impacted on Kasumi. She was a practiced Christian, and though Ranma didn't know much about the religion, she did know that she was a profound symbol of it. She would have to do well not to sully the girl's faith, she couldn't bare to hurt the older girl.<p>Their father just outright didn't associate with Ranma. It didn't escape her attention that he was missing from both breakfast and dinner; her own father started to keep distant from her, and that troubled Ranma dearly. Her father was one of the few constants in her life, and she loved him for simply being her father. She looked to him for comfort when times such as these weighed heavy on her For now, all she could do was enjoy the company of the fish that swam as close as they could to her, almost crowding each other in the effort to feel the aura of safeness and contentment she radiated. Ranma would give much to enjoy those same sensations.<p>The stars in the small waves winked at her like tears glistening from an iota of heaven's light, and she sighed; she dearly wished she was not hurting the Tendous as she was, but she had a grave feeling her leaving would hurt them so much more if certain things were not addressed.<p>"Would you like to be alone?" It was Nabiki's voice, which surprised Ranma.<p>"I... would like the company, thank you," the redhead replied, relaxing her wings slightly from where she had them wrapped around herself, and then tightened them against her body as if trying to make them seem as small as possible.<p>"You don't have to do that for my sake," Nabiki stated, "they're there, I'll just have to deal with the sight of them."<p>"I'm sorry if I make you so nervous. I would never want to hurt you, or anyone." Nabiki almost crumbled from what Ranma had said to her, but quickly focused on the 'or anyone' part.<p>"Don't worry about it," Nabiki replied, nonchilantly, as she sat down on a rock next to Ranma, "it's not like you can help it, right?"<p>"Still, all the same, just my being here is causing you all problems."<p>"Ranma..." Nabiki schooled herself, distancing herself from the dam holding back her emotions, and praying it held as she addressed the angel, "I would be lying if I said this was something we could all blow off, but if anything, it would probably be best for us if... well..." Nabiki stopped, finding herself gazing in Ranma's eyes, and finding a great peace that should not be found in those seemingly sad crystal blue eyes.<p>Ranma noticed Nabiki's expression change to slight wonder, and slowly turned away from the girl, "Then why do you keep your distance?"<p>"Huh?" Nabiki asked, almost as if she had just snapped out of a trance.<p>"You and Kasumi and your father, you're much more subtle about it, but the others don't have your everlasting discipline. I fear that they're suffering from my presence."<p>"Not as everlasting as you think, Ranma," Nabiki replied in a whisper that Ranma still caught.<p>"Then, not that I am upset about it or anything, but I can tell you want to express yourself to me like your sister's trying to. It was all I could do to get her to let me leave so that she could finish her homework someone brought for her from school."<p>"It's nothing, I... just... I just don't know, alright?"<p>"I understand," Ranma's tone became a bit meloncholy, "You don't have to try to make me feel better."<p>"It scares me," Nabiki replied, quietly, "these feelings, what you represent, everything about you, it just brings out things, questions that I never would have asked myself, or feelings I just don't know how to deal with. If I had to confront them, I'm afraid of what it would mean."<p>"I'm not exactly a philosopher, but I think you need to face things as they come. If you don't, then they continue to get at you until they overwhelm you. At least in the beginning, they can be handled."<p>"I don't know!" Nabiki almost shouted, "I've done things that... that may make me a bad person."<p>"I don't think you're a bad person," Ranma said in a voice that was almost singing, "In fact, I see an inner beauty that matches your loveliness on the outside, with a little hint of mischief to match your beautiful impish grin."<p>Nabiki never had a chance. Her tears began to flow unhindered and unrestrained, as she once again stared into Ranma's beautiful eyes, "Th-thank you, Ranma..."<p>Ranma unfolded the wing on the side Nabiki was on, and used it to pull her to laying her head across her lap, "I couldn't do anything else, but let you know that you shouldn't have to take such an unbearable strain. If it broke you, I wouldn't know what to do, then." Ranma softly pet Nabiki's hair, as she quietly sobbed onto the angel's lap.<p>"Thank you, oh deities, thank you!"<p>Akane stood on the porch. She hadn't heard what they were talking about, but the intimate closeness that she saw Nabiki experiencing with Ranma made her jealous. What hurt Akane more, though, was her guilt for that jealousy. Just from the notion, she just knew she didn't deserve to even be in Ranma's presence. Even Kasumi seemed to think she didn't deserve to be around Ranma, and Kasumi was the sweetest person Akane knew. With her eyes closed in deep shame, Akane turned, and walked back inside.<p>Akane walked by Ranma's father, who glanced at her with only slight concern, before continuing his search for his son. He went out to the porch, where he had known Akane had just left from, and his expression grew furious at the sight.<p>"RANMA! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING NEAR THAT POND?"<p>Ranma jolted, as did Nabiki at the shout. The latter quickly wiped her face, and scooted a good distance away from the redhead.<p>"Dad, I..."<p>"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT! GET AWAY FROM THAT DAMNABLE COLD WATER, NOW! WHERE THE HELL ARE THOSE AMAZONS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING OVER YOU?" Genma's white-knuckled grip threatened to crush through the banister in his rage.<p>Ranma stood, and then turned to her father with a posture of meekness, "They were exhausted. I told them they needed to sleep, or they wouldn't be any use to me."<p>"Excuses..." Genma grumbled, as he watched Ranma slowly walk away from the pond. Ranma sighed; even the asthetically pleasing sensation the sight of a body of water was denied her, now. She wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Why is it she can bring joy to everyone else, but suffer their burdens along with her own already heavy load?<p>Nabiki didn't miss Ranma's face becoming even sadder than before. "I'm so sorry, Ranma," she whispered with more sincerity than she had used since her mother's death.<p>Ranma slowly dawned what comfortable clothing she could wear to sleep; that was one thing about her wings, they didn't make dressing easy.<p>"Ranma..." The redhead turned to Akane's voice.<p>"Come in." Akane walked in, and froze. Ranma paused, wondering what brought on Akane's reaction, before noticing where Akane's eyes were. The redhead looked down at her bare breasts, and then back to Akane, and tilted her head, curiously.<p>Akane gulped, as she stared at Ranma wearing nothing but a pair of boxers. Though normally the image of such a busty looking girl in boxers would seem a bit comical, to Akane, the sight of Ranma's creamy flesh tipped with pink buds of the most perfect of flowers just seemed to be the most beautiful sight to her on so many more levels than she could comprehend.<p>Ranma sighed, as she bent down to pick up her shirt from the ground. Not wanting to fight having to put it on at the moment, she folded her arms over it while it was draped over her chest, at leas providing some modesty, "Is there something you wanted, Akane?"<p>Akane quickly redirected her head, blushing at how she had been staring; it just compounded her sins in her mind, "I'm... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have bothered you."<p>"Akane, something's obviously bothering you, you don't need to leave."<p>"I have to, I shouldn't be here with you!"<p>"What do you mean?" Ranma asked in that same symphonic voice that she had used on Nabiki.<p>"I don't deserve it! I was staring at you!" Akane nearly shouted, causing Ranma to idly wonder if all three girls were prone to raising their voices easily in the heat of the moment.<p>Ranma discarded the though, and decided to be frank, "Akane, are you interested in girls?"<p>The question shocked Akane out of her self-guilt, but it only served to depress her more, "I didn't used to think so, but when you came, I... I've been having these... urges. I know they're not natural, but with you they just feel so... so right!"<p>"Akane, for one thing, don't call them 'urges', it just demeans your feelings," Ranma chided, "And just because you feel that way about one person, doesn't put you into a catagory. Though, is that why you fight with all those boys in the morning?"<p>"No... I would like to talk with them, at least. If they didn't act so much like... like boys! But they just... I just don't like them. If I liked any boy... like that, I want to be friends with them, first. But I can't do that if they're trying to beat me up at school!"<p>"Have you ever told any of them this? They could get the hint."<p>"I doubt it," Akane said in a resigned tone.<p>"Akane, you would never know, until you try."<p>"Maybe..." Akane replied, looking directly at Ranma's face for the first time during the conversation.<p>Ranma had been approaching Akane during the conversation, and was now standing in front of her, "I don't think you'll ever be happy, until you find some boy with the same intrests as you, who truely understands what it is to love you. I don't know about relationships, but I-MPH!"<p>Akane had grabbed Ranma by the back of her shoulders, just above her wings, and the small of her back, and pulled her as close to her as possible; as if trying to absorb Ranma into her. The youngest Tendou daughter had greedily saught after Ranma's lips, sucking lightly with hers at where Ranma's came together at the middle.<p>Ranma had immidiately closed her eyes, and returned the kiss with angelic gentleness. She brought her hands and placed them lightly upon Akane's waisted, holding her firmly but protectively. Akane finally broke the kiss, pulling away for a bit, then pulled forward again to steal another light kiss, this time finding Ranma's bare flesh against the thin cloth of her pajama top.<p>"I've been, I've been needing to do that since Nabiki stopped me, earlier," Akane replied, a bit breathlessly.<p>"Oh? When was this?" Ranma asked with a curious, singing lilt.<p>"When you were sleeping earlier," Akane replied, her face blushing furiously, "I guess this does make me a lesbian, huh? Deities, I've been wanting to do that so bad..."<p>"Had you even paid attention to a word I've said?" Ranma asked with a jovial tone, before her expression became serious, "No, it doesn't. What it showed me was a girl who is starved for affection. You get attention, but that doesn't feed the soul..." Ranma brought her right hand to the back of Akane's head, and tilted the other girl's forehead down to her lip's reach. Ranma kissed Akane there, with a kiss that a mothers would give their daughters, a lovers would give to their loves, kind noblemen and priests would give to their peasants in blessing. It was the sweetest kiss Akane could have ever recieved.<p>"Remember, if you need anyone, I am there for you, Akane. I love you, just as I love your sisters, our fathers... I love you."<p>Akane couldn't say anything, finding her throat too tight. She shifted her head and leaned her forehead against Ranma's. The angel brought her left hand up, and wiped a single tear from Akane's cheeck, "Now, go to bed, we can talk more in the morning, okay?"<p>Akane nodded, still not able to fully use her voice, and left the room. Ranma sighed; if she wasn't able to find her own happiness, at least she could provide those around her with the joy they all much needed.
