</div><p>'A Warring Concience'<p>She stood in the duality that represented Ranma's mind, glaring defiantly at her ever-present companion and tormenter. Her wings splayed out in full span, almost threateningly, as her arms dangled casually by her sides. Golden eyes glowed with anger, exasperation... and shame.<p>"What is your game?"<p>That grin, that maddening, grin that seemed more like a condesending sneer, it assaulted her like a heavy attack through a firm guard; even secure, the blows would sting.<p>The Devil tilted his head, and folded his arms, "We've been through this before, as you said, 'this is not a game'."<p>"You had your rematch with Genma within your grasp, no one would interfere, yet you passed it by?" The Angel was perplexed, perplexed by what his motives could be, as she was by the graying of her half of the domain they both inhabited.<p>"I do not intend to settle my dispute with that man in a moment of convenience," the Devil responded, "When I do, it will be when it is time."<p>The blonde divine-blessed creature that opposed the Devil closed her eyes and bowed her head slightly to the side. This wasn't how things were supposed to be going, they were not out of control, but she had come too close. Worse, she had no idea what her counter-part was intending. Before they had arrived in Nerima, she was capable of keeping him in check for the fact that she knew what he would do. He was her opposite, her balancing counterpart; she only needed to predict what he would do by simply pondering on what she would not do. Now...<p>The Angel opened her eyes, this time they held neither the anger nor the exasperation before. Now, there only remained the shame, with a new addition.<p>The Devil shifted, completely unsettled by the look his counterpart was favoring him with. He thought he would be glad to see it within her eyes, he had imagined himself gloating triumphantly to finally see this emotion within her. But now, he condemned himself for what he was feeling.<p>The Devil felt pity for the Angel, for the Angel now knew fear.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I told you it was a bad idea! I TOLD YOU!" Nabiki screamed, shivering at even the slightest scenario her overworking imagination could fathom.<p>The angel only sat on the floor of the guest room on her knees, her hands grasping the hem of the robe she was given upon her arrival. Quietly, she allowed herself to accept the anger, fear, and desperation that the middle Tendou sister vocally expelled, and her sister Akane silently radiated. She understood full well the extremes of their emotions; what their cause was, as it was only a little less than an hour ago that the ordeal took place.<p>Genma silently stood by, not actually listening to the frantic girl's rant, as he was lost in his own thoughts. That smile the demon left him with, the knowing, triumphant grin across its dark and malicious face that spoke of a finalized battle that the other side would not win. The stout martial artist turned to look out the window, observing the twinkling night sky; Genma feared what it would mean when he discovered the answer to that smile, and knew that when he saw it again, it would be the endgame.<p>"Nabiki, I needed to do it, my only regret was that I was unable to reach her," Ranma answered, somberly. She was ashamed, ashamed that she could not help the girl that was obviously so troubled in life. Kodachi radiated her need like magnatism, attracting the Angel to her. Alas, Kodachi was as similarly afflicted as her brother was, but she relished in it, as where Tatewake was an unwitting victem.<p>"Ranma," Nabiki forced herself to calm down, though her voice continued to tremble with barely restrained emotion, "Kodachi... I shouldn't have let you... I..."<p>"Why, Ranma?" Akane took over, her voice barely above a whisper.<p>Ranma looked up, and caused Akane's heart to nearly seize. The unshed tears within them shattered any resolve like fragile glass thrown down from the Heavens. "Because... I can't bare to see anyone hurting."<p>"BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?" Nabiki demanded, forcing her fury to be predominant, "HOW COULD WE BARE TO SEE YOU HURT?"<p>Nabiki dropped to her knees, weak from the weight of her emotions. Almost crawling, she clasped onto Ranma's robe, as the tears began to trail down her cheek, "R-Ranma.. I c-couldn't take it i-if s-s-something were t-to... if..."<p>Ranma's arms encircled Nabiki's waist, and pulled the girl into a tight hug. The middle Tendou sister's sobs even shuddered through the angel's frame, as she attempted to calm the girl. As she attempted to quell the emotions that held firm onto Nabiki, she had lost her own control, when she heard the faintest whisper; one that may not have even been meant for her ears...<p>"I... just couldn't live... anymore."<p>A warm and discomforting growth in her sternum made itself known, just as the pressure behind her eyes grew, causing them to widen. The sensations that appeared signified the start of her dread; as she possibly gained a glimmer of what the repercussions of her arrival were.<p>"Dear gods," Ranma whispered even softer, "What am I doing to you?"<hr noshade="" size="1"/></p><p>Kasumi heard the commotion all the way from the kitchen, but still refused to be present at Ranma's reprimand. She wasn't aware of the reputation this Kodachi Kuno had, but her sisters were rather adimant in their worry and outrage.<p>Kasumi couldn't comprehend why they were so scared for Ranma; the angel was capable of becoming that... that beast. The eldest Tendou daughter doubted that a mere pampered and eccentric rich girl could ever hope to pose a threat to something that ruled the hells below, and demanded battle with impudent glee.<p>It was so puzzling for her; that she fear the harold of blessings, yet... for the harbinger of misery, she didn't fear him, but respected him. No doubt he was the more dangerous of Ranma's dual personas, and even with what she would even intellectually consider an irrational fear of the angel, she would gladly stare down the devil defiantly.<p>Ran Ran and Lin Lin entered the kitchen, and stood by several moments before Kasumi noticed them. "Ran Ran, Lin Lin, may I help you?"<p>The twins looked at one another, before the torquiose one spoke up, "You no fear devil?"<p>Kasumi's head raised, just as the girls put voice to the question on her own mind, "I... don't know." She turned away, knowing what her answer truly should have been, but not wanting the girls' critizing her notions.<p>"But he evil, and kill too, too many warrior and people," the second twin argued, "He is to be feared, yes?" Kasumi kept quiet at that note, unsure of how she should reply.<p>After a long quiet, Lin Lin spoke again, bowing her head, "We sorry we not stop him from taking Kasumi."<p>At that, the older girl faced the twins again, "It's alright, he didn't intend to harm me. He merely... wanted some answers."<p>"This one no understand," Ran Ran spoke up, "He no want to hurt Kasumi?"<p>"No, he didn't," Kasumi replied, firmly, "I don't think he would have any intention of hurting me."<p>"Why?"<p>Such an innocent question, Kasumi would realize, "Isn't it true he didn't harm anyone unless they were fighters like him?" She watched the two girls begrudingly nod at the counter-inquiry, though she within believed different. She... she just knew Ranma wasn't going to hurt her, that he wouldn't think of striking her down in any fashion. She could stand not an inch from his face, and shout the vilest of obscenities, and still know she was secure from his wrath. But in coming to this realization, Kasumi became more dumbfounded.<p>What was it between them that left her confident in remaining his opposition?<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi stood before the door to the guest room, where Ranma was currently the sole occupant. Her bodyguards and father were dismissed for the moment, due to the angel's urgent request to be alone with her thoughts. They were placated, as there were no liquids in the room, and none allowed near even the door.<p>She didn't want to intrude, nor did she have any true favor to speak with the angel; just the poximity she currently was at kept her uneased from the sensations that radiated from Ranma, even behind the door. Concentrating on the matter at hand, she knocked.<p>"Please, leave me alone," Ranma pleaded from the other side of the door.<p>Kasumi took a deep breath, and looked down at the glass of water and thermos she snuck up with her, "I need to... to speak with him."<p>Ranma's silence weighed on her far greater than any physical pressure. Finally the silence relented, but the tension didn't, "I can't do that, Kasumi."<p>Kasumi nearly groaned. She didn't even know why she needed to do this, but she knew what the consequences would be, "Please, it's urgent." She then considered her alternative plan, "Then if not him... could you tell me... tell me what he might have been thinking the other day?"<p>Once again, it took several intense moments before Ranma spoke again, I... I wish to be left alone."<p>Kasumi backed away from the door, disappointed but knowing this would most likely be the outcome. With a sigh, she went into her room to desposit the glass and thermos, before heading back downstairs.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma listened to Kasumi's footsteps descend the stairs, before retracting her hand from the door, and backing away from it. Ranma's head bowed as her wings sagged; a once brilliant rose wilting in remourse. She didn't understand the reason for Kasumi's peculiar request, but she couldn't comply with it for more than simple prudence.<p>Ranma didn't completely understand the devil's motives, but obeyed them when in her other form as if they were instinct. And just last night, she could not comprehend what he was planning, when he simply gave up his fleeting freedom. It frightened her, that she didn't know himself as the devil.<p>It frightened her now, as she had come to realize she knew even less about herself as the angel.</p>
