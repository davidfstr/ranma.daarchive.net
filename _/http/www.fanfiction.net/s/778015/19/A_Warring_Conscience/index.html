</div>'A Warring Concience'<p>Even without light, her wings held a soft illuminence in the dark room. In the corner of the guest room, hidden away from the stars above and lacking the light of the new moon, the darkness greedily attempted to absorb the gentle glow from the red headed angel; midnight blight ceaselessly holding seige on esper white. Her father, nor the twins occupied the room with her this night, as her request had been to be alone, alone with her thoughts. It had become all too common as of late, for her to request solitude for contemplation, but in truth, it wasn't even for that.<p>Ranma could no longer remain blind to what was happening to those around her; the amazon twins had their lives forever changed, more or less exiled from their home for a responsibility that was not theirs in the first place. Even if they insisted that it was their honor, the angel felt she had no right to hold their loyalty and service. Her own father had become distant from her, almost seeming to close his emotions off with the exclusion of an intensity that bordered on ever present anger. She missed what scant times she remembered her father's kind praise when she had mastered a technique, or even his gruff and fumbling attempts at goading her to improve. Even if he went about it the wrong way, she had loved him for his efforts on her behalf.<p>Akane was possibly now more confused than before she had met Ranma; at once questioning her own sexuality. Ranma wouldn't know if she had clarified things for the youngest Tendou, but she wasn't sure of how much the effect of her company was responsible for her questioning her own sexual identity. Nabiki... she didn't understand the posessive nature that had overcome her, that had overcome her and her youngest sister. It was as if anyone close to Ranma was a valid target for her animosity. Her father, the twins, Tatewake... to various degrees, Nabiki's distain towards them was present behind a closely held veil of tolerance or apathy or acceptance. At first, it had been unnoticable, yet over time it was growing, and still yet growing to something that may even rival the Kuno's fanatism. Kasumi outright avoided her.<p>A light, scatto, plutter against the window of the room alerted Ranma to the beginning shower. She sat up on her bedding, and folded her hands in her lap. "What can I do?" she asked herself, wishing someone could answer her. As much as everyone around her saught some sort of divine strength from her, Ranma had no idea who she could recieve support from. Tatewake had consoled her, but his current situation served to bring her more guilt than consolence. Her own lonliness was overwhelming, much more as she knew anyone she did seek out would only fall prey to her 'damned blessing'.<p>It now had her attention; the tightening in her chest that was like a hand clenched around her heart. Obviously, it was a physical manifestation of the great solitude upon her. It ached with a dull throbbing that wretched the tears from her, causing the glistening dews to shimmer down soft, pale cheeks. She quieted a sniffle, knowing someone would probably listening at the door. There was nothing they could do for her, and their attempts would only worsen things. They would probably blame themselves, or seek out whomever potentially had brought her this pain.<p>God, the pain was now becoming unbearable. With the pain, her own helplesness grew. Why was this happening? She was so confused; for the life of her, she couldn't grasp how she could be so affecting to everyone in such negative fashions. She was supposed to be some damned divine being! She wasn't supposed to hurt them in any way, she didn't WANT to hurt anyone in any way.<p>Her chest felt as if it were being condensed into coal; the intense crush upon it elicited a choked sob she couldn't stop. It was becoming harder to think, and she could feel herself trembling. She couldn't take it anymore, she needed... she...<p>Suddenly, the angel was on her feet, and raced to the window. The sound of tiny drops of water meeting glass changed to drops upon wood floor, and Ranma's tears were washed away as her sadness was replaced with mirth.<p>Genma, Lin Lin, and Ran Ran burst into the guest room, finding what they feared from Akane's panicked explanation. The twins both rushed to the window, ready to take off into the night after their charge.<p>"Stop."<p>Both haulted before turning to Genma with surprised and confused expressions, "Teacher?" Lin Lin enquired, requesting an explanation without so many words.<p>"Leave him be, he'll return when he's ready," the elder Saotome commanded, before exiting the room.<p>"But..." Ran Ran started.<p>"No."<p>The twins simply turned back to the window, wondering if their inaction would prove more dire than Genma seemed to care.<p>Ranma stood on the roof of the Tendou home, rather disappointed that no one followed. With a resigned sigh, he plucked off a shingle from the roof, and idly tossed it to his side.<p>"Ouch!"<p>With a deft backwards somersault, Ranma flipped off the roof with his wings spread, landing easily, and reached out a hand to casually snatch the scruff of the small figure between two fingers. "You are trespassing."<p>The figure remained frozen speechless at the presence of the demon. When he had seen the change, his heart nearly stopped; the feeling, the need to be close to the angel suddenly dissappeared, replaced by a revultion and almost unnatural fear.<p>"I asked you what you're doing here, manservant."<p>Sasuke snapped to at the demand, and opened his mouth to comply, but unable to speak out of sheer terror. The devil narrowed his eyes, almost snarling; even bothering with the pathetic wretch wasn't worth his time, but he was curious as to why he was being spyed upon. "I sincerely doubt that the bedridden one put you up to this, since I believe him and my... alternative have come to an agreement, so that leaves the wench."<p>"I...I..."<p>"You are sincerely pathetic," Ranma snarled, before sticking the index finger of his free hand just an inch below Sasuke's chin, "I think I'll rather you stay quiet for the time being." With that, he flicked the ninja under the chin, knocking him unconcious. With a snort, Ranma crouched, raising his wings up, and launched himself with his legs and a powerful flap back to the roof. With another mighty bound off of the domicile, he allowed his wings to catch the winds about him, as the rain beat down upon their leathern surface. Twisting in the air, he glided towards the Kuno manner.<p>From within the Tendou home, Kasumi turned away from the window, choosing to remain silent to the rest of the family at what she had just witnessed.<p>In the complete darkness of her room, alone with the complete shadow and sounds of the harsh ran beyond her window, Kodachi writhed upon her bed. her own hands traveled her flesh, uninhibited by the kimono, and the leotard she had shed upon the floor. She wanted rough hands, powerful hands capable of ripping apart large reptiles, hands owned by hellish creatures in the shape of man... she wanted those hands to be the ones upon her.<p>Marvelous, she couldn't think of anything more magnificent than the demon; from the crimson scar that seemed to glow like flowing blood against its late dusk hued skin, to the great malice its very presence radiated. Lust wasn't an emotion she was accustomed to, and it totally enveloped her since that encounter. She hadn't even gone to school, as she didn't want any distractions from her newfound subject of worship.<p>A louder moan escaped her lips, as her own hands began to grope against her almost painfully; soon, she would freely give herself to whom she would announce her own lord. Just as her fantasies threatened to pull her back into the deepest recesses of her own madness, she jolted to sitting up at the sound of her window shattering.<p>"What?" She looked to see what had broken her window, finding her servant unconcious on the other side of the room, "WHO DARES?"<p>"I was gonna ask you the same, actually."<p>Kodachi's eyes widened at the voice, just before the aura hit her; it was there, like a caller in the midnight with intentions for her. "A-Akuma-sama?"<p>Ranma ignored her name for him, uninterested in whatever she chose to address him as, "Your pet was treading on my privacy, I demand to know why."<p>"You've come to me!" Kodachi responded in a tone of absolute wonder. She stood up from her bed, totally unabashed at her nudity either by lack of any light, or her total maddened devotion, and approached the devil as if in a trance, "You've come here for me."<p>Ranma's snarl melted into a frown, "What the hell are you talking about?"<p>"I..." Kodachi found herself nervous, at a loss of what to say. Swallowing, she regrouped what courage she had left, and knelt, "I only exist for you, Akuma-sama. My devotion is only to you."<p>"I never asked for it, I only want to know why your little man was bothering me."<p>"Akuma-sama, please permit me to-"<p>"Shut up!" Ranma cut her off, "I don't even really care, but the next time I see him spying on me, he will be returned in five seperate parts." Ranma turned back to the window, putting his foot on the ledge to step out.<p>"NO! Don't leave me!"<p>Ranma reacted on instinct, as soon as he felt her approach, and spun around. His hand caught her throat, and slammed her against the wall next to the window. His frown was more subtle this time, as he seemed to be studying the girl, before it deeped again; she seemed to be enjoying his handling of her.<p>"You and your brother seem to share the same insanity," the devil commented, before dropping the girl to the floor. "Leave me alone." With that, Ranma leapt out the window.<p>After the demon's departure, Kodachi pulled herself to sitting, holding onto her own throat, more as if reveling in the touch that she had experienced than in alleving any pains she may have felt. With but a touch, she knew that she would give everything she had to be his; her heart, her body, her very soul were all forfeit.<p>She would stop at nothing, for she was already damned.
