</div>Ranma/Tekken<br/>'A Warring Concience'<br/>Chapter 1<p>The three sisters fought to overcome their awe, choosing to divide more of their attention upon either their unconcious father, or the two Chinese girls that sat on each side of Ranma. Unfortunately, they felt all too compelled to look back towards the angelic looking girl, sipping from the solid mug of tea that she had been offered. For their benefit, Ranma did not make eye contact with them, having experience in the effects the unmeasured depths of her eyes have on others. It was far from unpleasant to gaze into her crystaline irises, but the sight that greeted most when they looked upon them too long was something they were far from ready for.<p>Nabiki's own eyes traced the soothingly smooth contours of Ranma's hands, as she gently gripped her mug as if it were the most fragile thing in the world, and came to the conclusion, as much as her materialisticly rooted mind would allow, that there was something far beyond natural about the red headed guest.<p>"Ranma," Nabiki cleared her throat, and looked down at her own serving of tea, "If you don't mind me for asking... what are you?"<p>Akane blinked, and looked towards her sister in puzzlement, Kasumi verbally chided Nabiki, "Nabiki, that isn't a polite question."<p>Ranma lowered her head, so that her dark stone gray hood hid her face but the slight smile that had shown below it that almost make Nabiki swoon, "That's okay, it's a question that needs to be answered."<p>"Ranma?" the girl with the pink hair enquired tentatively.<p>"It's okay, Lin Lin. Ah, I forgot to introduce everyone," Ranma pointed to the girl that had just spoken, "This is Lin Lin, and her twin sister is Ran Ran. They are my guards."<p>"Guards? But why?" Kasumi asked in curiosity.<p>"Yeah, aren't you a martial artist?" Akane added, though her instincts screamed that this flawless girl could not possibly practice anything of violence.<p>"They are to protect you from me," Ranma replied quietly, and then turned to her father. Genma was sitting in the corner of the room, watching the events, as he waited for his old friend to regain conciousness. He caught his daughter glance in his direction, and nodded.<p>"But, what could you p-possibly do to us?" Akane asked with a hint of worry in her voice that was barely noticed over the sense of comfort Ranma's presence imbued in her.<p>Ranma took a deep breath, and stood. She opened her cloak to reveal a white Chinese outfit of the loveliest silk that was lined at the hems with what seemed to be true gold woven into threads. She then untied the bind that held her cloak around her, and removed it. What the girls saw nearly completely overwhelmed them. Even Genma, Lin Lin, and Ran Ran seemed awed at the spectacle, despite seeing it many times before.<p>Ranma spread her wings, which were covered with what seemed to be the softest down, and flexed them majestically. Kasumi found her faith, the faith that she shared with her mother and no one else in the Tendou household, validated at that moment. Nabiki felt her world pulled away from her, leaving her in a radiant whiteness where only Ranma and her confusion existed; this wasn't possible, but she knew it was real before her.<p>Akane was the one that spoke, her tone in sheer awe that seemed to be woven with sobs of joy, "Y-you're... a... a real..."<p>"Yes," Ranma answered for her, "When me and Pop were in China, we had happened upon an ancient training ground. Jusenkyo, valley of the Cursed Springs. Our guide attempted to warn us, as me and Pop sparred over the springs. They were cursed, each one having a tragic story of some sort. The purpose of the training was to balance upon the tall bamboo reed poles that were placed in the springs, lest you fall into one of the springs themselves. At one point, I had found a pole near the base of a cliff that had been rotted from year's wear. I landed upon it, and it broke with my weight."<p>Ranma sat back down, folding her wings behind her, and picked her mug back up, "At first the guide was not too concerned, since the only one who had ever fallen into the spring was a little boy over twenty years ago, and he hadn't drowned. But... when I emerged..."<p>The girls waited for Ranma to continue, as she her voice seemed to fade at a far from pleasant memory, "I... was no longer myself. The curse of the Springs is you take the form of whatever had fallen in them. It was originally thought that I had fallen into an uncursed spring, since the boy who had fallen in it long ago had not died in it, and nothing since had approached the spring. That alone should had alerted the guide, but I do not fault him for that."<p>"But... you're an angel! How is that so bad?" Akane asked, feeling a familiar pang of jealousy, but only a slight pang.<p>"My original gender is a guy," Ranma replied solumnly, "And this is actually a 'blessing', something that I was given to counter-balance my curse."<p>"Then... what is your curse?" Nabiki asked, knowing she should be sceptical of the whole story, but finding herself unable to be pessimistic towards Ranma.<p>"My cursed form is of a demon, a powerful one. It isn't a benevolent being by any stretch of the imagination, and it's goal is a hunger for violence and... revenge for something we do not know what. When I first emerged with the curse, our guide was scared out of his wits, as was my father."<p>Genma snorted, "I... was merely taken by surprise, is all. I did not fear you would harm your old man."<p>"I understand, Pop," Ranma replied with a small smile in his direction, "But as I was confused at the time, I was easily subdued, and reverted back to my uncursed form."<p>"So, you no longer are cursed by a Demon?" Kasumi asked.<p>"Unfortunately, I still hold that curse. The guide explained that it would only be in effect when I was splashed with cold water, and hot water would revert me back to what was my normal form. At first the Demon seemed placid, only coming into grips with himself, but, and the guide had promised to lead us to some one who may be able to remove my curse."<p>"When Ranma come to Amazon Village," Ran Ran interjected.<p>"Lin Lin no know details, but Ranma fight whole village, Ranma winning badly," Lin Lin added.<p>"The Demon realized what our intent was, and decided that he must be defeated first if we were to rid him from Ranma."<p>"From Ranma?" Nabiki enquired, "You're Ranma, right?"<p>"It was tragic for the Amazons, even when they thought they had hope, they were to fail. It was at that time that the Heavens blessed us... me..."<p>"And that is when you became an angel?" Akane interrupted again. Ranma smiled at her to let her know that she hadn't been finished yet.<p>"Ranma's cursed form is able to somewhat manipulate me in my uncursed form."<p>"Forgive me, but you're a bit confusing. You speak as if Ranma is... someone else?" after Kasumi spoke, she leaned back, and gasped at the sight of Ranma's eyes. This time they were a much lighter blue, like the faintness of the sky, and the irises were trimmed with a gold corona.<p>"Ranma is between the balance of grave importance. I had failed one soul... once. I will not fail two souls this time."<p>"Oh..." Kasumi replied, understanding the signifigance before anyone else. Even Nabiki seemed to be at a loss for what was meant.<p>"My faithful associates, Lin Lin and Ran Ran, along with my Pop, watch over me to ensure that I am not splashed with cold water. The cloak I wear also is for that matter, unfortunately the magic upon it is weak at best, and we do not fear it would last beyond a few more uses, as the rain outside had wore it down a great deal. Hopefully my angel presence will mollify the demon's constant anger if... when it does emerge, and it has its own sense of honor, regardless of how twisted it is, so it wouldn't attack without provication. But we still fear the consequences would be dire if the Devil were to be released."<p>"You... know it will be released?" Nabiki asked, "Why not just avoid cold water as much as possible? And also keep hot water handy in a thermos or something as a safety measure?"<p>"The Devil is cunning, and would expect such a ploy, and the nature of the Jusenkyo curse itself seems to make an attraction to me for cold water, it's rather inevoidable."<p>"Are... are you dangerous?" Akane questioned, now with a slight fear and trepidation in her voice.<p>Ranma leveled a gaze at her that was remourseful beyond anything Akane could ever find on a human being's face; she almost weeped in dispair for the redhead angel, "Very dangerous, but all we can do is bear it, and hope soon that a positive outcome would be the product of our internal battle. Hopefully, the demon we know as Kazuya will of haste, be defeated."<p>"If you're so dangerous, why were you allowed to..."<p>"Ranma wished it," Ran Ran interjected, earning Nabiki's frank gaze.<p>"Ranma free to go whereever he please," Lin Lin added, scooting closer to Ranma.<p>Ranma lowered her head, "We all know the reason I had left. The Elders of your tribe were at their wits end in how to deal with me. I was marked by what they believed to be the ancestors, so they could not kill me without earning their wrath, but I was too dangerous for their tribe, in the fact I could potentially revert, and finish the task that the demon had set to do that day. You two are more here to ensure that I actually left China."<p>"Ranma sworn blood sister to Lin Lin and Ran Ran, we never abandon."<p>"Is true, Ranma. Not allow you to fight demon alone."<p>"If you're so dangerous, why are you near people?" Akane asked, forcing herself to utter what felt so wrong to her, but needed to be asked.<p>Ranma's eyes became tired, "Our travel has been great, can we rest for the evening, so that the morning I can continue? Perhaps your father may recover by..."<p>"Wha-what happened?" Soun asked, sitting up, and immidiately gazing upon Ranma. The results were expected."<p>"I guess we should wait until Father is capable of following this conversation," Kasumi sighed, "I shall show you up to the guest room."
