</div>'A Warring Concience'<p>Her father was watching her a lot closer, Ranma realized. She didn't think he knew of what had happened, but from the way Ran Ran and Lin lin were acting, his scruteny of their dicipline had gotten stronger. As an adverse effect, he took it upon himself to help ensure no incidents occured. Before, she wouldn't have minded, as it served to prove that he did indeed care for her, and for the safety of others around her. Since the invoking of Ranma's curse, Genma had changed from the hypocrite that Ranma had barely approached contempt for, to a stern sentinel, strong in his resolve. If there was one thing that came from Ranma's transition, it was that it had begun to make her father a better man.<p>Looking out the dojo window, learning against the frame of the opening, while her bottom wingtips brushed the smooth laquered wooden floor, she considered the conversation she had with Kasumi. It was... insightful, to say the least.<p>Just as she suspected, the girl feared the angel in her midst as some foreboding herald of trajedy. Unfortunately, it would be extremely difficult to approach Kasumi to change that perception, as the girl avoided her intensely. Ironic, that the true danger would be the one that she willingly confronts without fear. Even moreso peculiar, as she seemed to be able to hold the Devil in check so well. At that realization, Ranma may have discovered how to approach the eldest Tendou daughter.<p>That, therein lie the problem. Genma had lost faith in Ran Ran and Lin Lin, and had partially taken it upon himself to ensure Ranma is protected from the ever-present menace of the curse and its trigger. For a great while, Kasumi would be unreachable.<p>Ranma sighed, as she felt the approach of light steps behind her; footfalls nearing silently as if not to disturb her. The angel felt no menace at the person's approach, and refrained from turning away from the sunlit morning. It was Nabiki, which was something of a surprise, realizing which Tendou sister it was by her height; the way she pressed her face softly into Ranma's hair and right wing, while wrapping her arms around the shorter girl's stomach in a warm hug.<p>"Soft..." Nabiki mumbled, as she rubbed her chin against Ranma's wing.<p>"Good morning, Nabiki, did you sleep well?" Ranma enquired, still looking out at the budding day.<p>"I sleep better than I have in years, thanks to you," Nabiki replied in a still sleep-muddled mumble.<p>Ranma brought her right hand down to lay over Nabiki's arms encircling her, "You're welcome. I'm glad I made you happy."<p>"Ranma... promise you'll never leave us..."<p>The angel went slightly rigid at the request. Nabiki sounded as if she were pleading in a dreamlike state; a request that was almost childish, yet so profound and demanding.<p>Ranma closed her eyes, as she leaned back against the taller girl, "I wish I could make that promise. I wish it could be that simple..."<p>Nabiki's arms grew tighter around Ranma, making the angel concerned about the sudden posessiveness. "Please, Ranma," Nabiki started, "Without you, I... what me and Akane were like before you arrived... I don't think I could ever deal with it again."<p>Ranma turned around in Nabiki's arms carefully, and planted a soft kiss on the other girl's cheek, while bringing her own arms around the middle Tendou sister, "I can promise you this. Even if we do have to part, it will not be by choice. And if I do have to, you will always have my love."<p>Nabiki hugged Ranma tighter, allowing the shorter girl to feel her nodding. What also didn't escape the angel's notice, was the drops of moisture falling upon her hair from Nabiki's face. It impressed upon her exactly how much of an impact she had on the girl, to bring out such potent emotions. To Ranma, it seemed almost painful in the realization that one day, she would have to rid herself of the curse, and that it may also be the end of her blessing as well. She may have to leave, and she feared the effect it may have on Nabiki, Akane, Ran Ran, and Lin Lin.<p>_<p>"You sure you want to do this, boy?" Genma sternly enquired, as he stood in the hospital hallway between Ran Ran and Lin Lin.<p>Ranma nodded, pulling her cloak's hood tighter over her head. "I'm responsible for this, it's something I have to own up to."<p>"He attacked you, boy. You owe him nothing."<p>"Exept for Akane's life," Ranma interjected, looking up at her father with determined eyes, "Why are you so disregarding of him?"<p>"He not disregarding him." Ran Ran interjected, "Stick boy dangerous. Go crazy again."<p>"Is true," Lin Lin added with a nod.<p>Ranma shook her head, "He's restrained, so he could be of any danger."<p>"Perhaps not to you, Ranma, but he could further injure himself," Genma argued, folding his arms across his chest. "Are you willing to take that chance for this pointless plea for forgiveness?"<p>Ranma closed her eyes, as she bowed her head, "I... I have to, alright?"<p>Genma snorted, "We'll wait out here." Ranma nodded, before heading into the hospital room. She entered, finding herself becoming even more solumn, as she approached the young man's bed.<p>Tatewake Kuno lay still, staring up at the ceiling above him, not even shifting his eyes towards his guest. "So, the angel has deemed it fitting to pay me a visit."<p>Ranma stopped short, shocked, "You're..."<p>With a humored snort, Kuno turned to look at the redheaded angel, "Indeed. I suppose you are surprised at my currently... reserved contenance?"<p>"That's one way of putting it," Ranma replied, relaxing more, "medication?"<p>"Nay, other than the coctail of painkillers I had been subjected to, nothing had been introduced to my person."<p>Ranma sat down in the chair next to Kuno, "Then, what's with the change from lunatic to disturbingly calm?"<p>Kuno turned to look back at the ceiling, "I've had much time to ponder, since I have been incapacitated within these walls."<p>"I'm sorry for what I had done to you. If I could have, I-"<p>"There is no need to apologise, for I am the one at fault," Kuno interjected, giving Ranma a glance to forestall any anticipated replies. "That day, I have come to understand, it wasn't... perhaps the most savory of introductions between us."<p>Despite the situation, Ranma favored Kuno with a soft, apologetic smile, "You've changed, why?"<p>"I..." Kuno paused in contemplation, "I do not understand, myself. I hadn't experienced this profound clarity of thought in... I don't know how long." The young man turned to look back at the angel that sat patiently by his side, "I had presumed it was by your grace that I have been favored, deemed worthy by what you may have percieved to be a selfless act for Akane Tendou's sake, at wince the demon that had been sent to judge me, and nearly did her great harm."<p>"I had nothing to do with this," Ranma replied, softly, "and why do you say that saving another was selfish?"<p>The glowing softness of Ranma's eyes forced Kuno to look away, for fear he wasn't truly worthy to gaze upon the crystal blue irises haloed by golden light of majesty, "I... I only did so, because at that moment, I despaired to see harm befall her. If I were to lose her, perhaps my madness would have become... even more grave. I failed to realize this at the time, but after much contemplation, I understand how I was at fault."<p>"Kuno... Tatewake..." Ranma laid her hand upon his arm to regain his attention, "For whatever the reason, it wasn't a selfish act to put one before yourself. The selfish only see to their own preservation, and put their safety before others. You lay in a hospital with grave injuries that prove your heart was beyond self-preservation."<p>"If you choose to rationalize it so," Kuno replied, before inhaling, and savoring her touch even through the thin cloth of the sleeve of his hospital robe. He opened his eyes, looking towards the window that allowed the soft glow of the sun's radiance in, giving the sterile walls almost an etheral, cloudlike essence. With Ranma beside him, Kuno would almost believe that he had been taken to heaven. It was only the notion that he was undeserving that diminished such hope. "You changed as well..."<p>Ranma blinked, before her eyes grew concerned, "So... you realized what happened? My curse?"<p>Kuno looked towards Ranma with a puzzled expression, "Curse? If that is what brought about your sudden change just now..."<p>Realizing the young man in the bed wasn't referring to their initial meeting, she tilted her head curiously, "Explain."<p>"You're suddenly different, as if... as if you have become another person all together, or something greater within an instant."<p>"I don't understand..."<p>"Perhaps I'm imagining things. It is of no consequence," Kuno replied, dismissing his observation.<p>"I have to admit that I'm rather impressed with your own change. You're actually pretty comfortable to talk with."<p>"Then perhaps you will not make this our only visit?" Kuno enquired, almost pleading, "I'm hesitant to admit that I rarely recieve visitors. I have yet to entertain even my sister since my admittance into this abode of healing."<p>"I'm sorry to hear that. I don't see why that wouldn't be possible, and for some reason, I can actually talk with you without, well... without you acting like you should be subservant to be around me."<p>Kuno favored Ranma with an ackward smile, "Maybe the arrogance I harbored during my delusions remains with me? Perhaps I choose to believe that I am rightous enough to walk with the angels as their equal?"<p>Ranma chuckled, "I don't hold myself above others, that is the reason why I walk among you."<p>Kuno stared at Ranma for several moments, as if trying to decipher something, or perhaps puzzling over what she had said. He gave Ranma one last smile, before speaking, "I thank you for your visit. It was assuradly an uplifting and enlightening one."<p>"As it was for me. I'm glad whatever... uh... insanity... that you had is gone. Sorry, but don't take that the wrong way."<p>Kuno smirked, "No offence taken. If you please, I would like to get some sleep. I had been awakened barely before the dawn for this and whatfor."<p>"Later, Kuno," Ranma replied, as she left the hospital room. She walked past her father and her two bodyguards as they were slumped against the wall, waiting for her. They watched her walk by, and approach the closest orderly available.<p>"Excuse me," Ranma begged for the nurse's attention, ensuring to keep her cloak tightly, and her own aura tight within her, "The young man, Kuno, how are his injuries doing?"<p>The woman walked over to the room and walked inside, before returning with a clipboard. "His spinal injury isn't much of a concern anymore, though the physicians are wary of any impediment of physical abilities for a few months. And the drugs within his system have been nearly flushed. He should be ready for release, presuming he foregoes physical therapy, within a month or so."<p>Ranma nodded under her cloak, thanking the woman for the information. It was one thing that had caught her attention, however that recieved her concern...
