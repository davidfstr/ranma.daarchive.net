</div>'A Warring Concience'<p>What came next happened so fast, even the ever cautious Genma Saotome was taken by surprise. The stout man leapt into the extremely intense fray that began like a massive spontanious combustion; a fiery turmoil erupting without any rhyme or reason. Much to the his surprise, he was almost effortlessly turned away by the black haired girls potent fury.<p>Ranma herself would have been as equally surprised to see her father sent away so efficiently, even while her opponent was keeping her main focus on herself. As it was, the angel was furiously fighting against the entanglements, gasses, and other impediments the young mistress of the Kuno estate fiercely attacked her with. But with her fight focused solely on her opponent, she could easily see it etched within her, a taint so condemning that it twisted her soul from possibly a form of propriety and innocence, to a malicious and demanding image of desperation. This madness, it was so much more powerful than her brothers, yet so strangely refined and focused.<p>"I had not come here to fight!" Ranma attempted to command, beginning to sweat from such a profound tradoff that had only lasted a sparce two minutes.<p>"Then it is within your best interest to submit!" Kodachi retorted, unphased by the appearance of Ranma's wings.<p>"I had *ugh* come here freely, and give the same compassion I do to your brother just as freely to you..." Ranma backflipped down the hall to gain some breathing space between her and her opponent, flapping her wings once to gain a slight more glide, "...but I am not about to 'submit' to whatever you like."<p>Kodachi growled, pulling a sphere from seemingly nowhere, causing Ranma to blink in astonishment. "Pity then..." Kodachi spoke in a deceptively calm voice that radiated so much danger, "For it is nothing LESS THAT IS REQUIRED OF YOU!"<p>Ranma leapt away just in time to avoid the exploding ball that landed before her. That same zealousness to possess her, it was how Tatewake had reacted to her upon their first meeting. What was it that caused such exorbitant reactions within the two? It seemed apparent to her that she shared the same ailment brought about by whatever drugs Tatewake may have unwittingly ingested or absorbed. The difference between them. however, was like a glaring light bulb and an intense laser. Where Tatewake was unfocused like and affected all around it, Kodachi's was intentful and concentrated on its aim. Ranma found it quite discerting to find it's aim directly on her.<p>Genma recovered from his daze, cursing himself for taking the girl so lightly. That ribbon of hers, she used as an exeptional weapon that he hadn't expected to be durable enough to wrap around him, and slam him head first into a wall. What really irritated the robust martial artist was the scant little attention she had paid to him.<p>Curbing his ego, Genma slowly stood up, and easily spyed the direction the fight had taken off to. At the large hole in the wall caused by one of Kodachi's exploding arniments, he spyed Sasuke staring after the destruction being wroght.<p>"She... she has never lost control like this," the family retainer muttered, easily shocked and more than a little frightened, just out of Genma's hearing range. He jolted when the stout martial artist laid a hand on him from behind.<p>"With me, come," Genma simply said, almost dragging Sasuke with him in their pursuit.<p>Ranma weaved between the elaborate patterns of the deceptively hazardous cloth that whispered through the air, with only a fleeting trace of it's prior position giving warning to where it would land next. The angel did not know what spurned such a reaction from this girl, but suspected it had much in relation to the affect she had on the gymnast's brother.<p>Launching into the air in a graceful somersault, given assistance by a slight glide of her wings, Ranma attempted to gain more space between them, hoping she could talk to the girl finally. Before she could complete a full rotation in the air, the pink ribbon snagged onto her ankles, arresting her backward momentum. The redheaded angel managed to twist herself to land her front against the grass, protecting her wings.<p>She quickly turned back to look at the maddened girl, sensually approaching victoriously and purposely. "Why?" Ranma asked, quickly disentangling her feet, and rolling to kneeling.<p>Kodachi tilted her head, "Why? I can only presume the meaning of your question, and if it is indeed what I suspect, then the answer is obvious to such a being as you."<p>Ranma slowly stepped back in caution, as the girl began twirling her ribbon almost casually. Looking back behind Kodachi, she found her father and the family servant quietly approaching. "I don't understand."<p>Kodachi paused, as if in mild shock, "How could you not? You, my dear are beyond far the most beautiful creature I have known in existance. Such loveliness was meant only for one of my privelage and stature. Quite simply, you were meant to be mine."<p>Ranma felt her nervousness grow, as well as a sense of pity. This girl, unlike her brother's blatant and driven madness, hers had an alluring dedliness, like a viper's gaze and its venomous bite. She was very much insane, yet her madness was quiet, potent to almost a palpable taste. Every word she uttered was demanding with such understated harshness that was nerve rendering, but almost influential.<p>The angel turned a wary eye towards Kodachi, "I would gladly offer friendship, but what you demand is not possible."<p>"Indeed so, it is possible, my darling cherub," Kodachi hissed, suddenly revealing her malice for everyone's observation, "Because, you ARE mine!"<p>Genma ducked the ribbon this time, suprised the girl knew of his position. The weapon latched onto one of the stone lanterns, jerking it from its mount, and crashing it to the ground. Immidiately, Ranma and Genma's senses went into overdrive, as the ambient danger around them picked up.<p>Genma swore, damning himself for only tending to the active traps, and not the dormant ones in order to save time. He dove to he ground as soon as he heard the whistling about him, signaling airborne arrows searching for a target.<p>Ranma frantically looked about, but realized that the projectiles were only heading in her father's direction. Quickly, she focused back on Kodachi in time to jump away from her latest attempt to subdue her. "Why? What in the world makes you think you have to own me? Even your brother acted the same-"<p>"My brother is inconsequential!" Kodachi interrupted, as she launched several roses at Ranma like darts. The pigtailed angel barely caught a wiff of the obnoxious scent that was intermingled with the sweet aroma of the roses before she held her breath, and dodged out of the way. She took several broad leaps in retreat, before finding herself at the edge of the pond she had seen earlier. Frantically, she looked at the cool water, much more fearful; not for herself, but for the life of the girl attacking her.<p>"Stop this!" Ranma demanded, as her eyes gained a golden corona around blue irises, "This ludicrous spat will only serve to bring the both of us to harm!"<p>"Then you but only need to surrender, and put this unfortunate business behind us."<p>"I will not accept your desires for my captivity, and I will continue to fight you if necessary," the Angel suddenly stated in a decidedly threatening tone. She spread her wings out, as she clenched her fists at her side. Behind her, the water's surface began to evaporate from the sudden generation of nearby heat from a battle aura, causing the mist to swirl about the now determined redhead in a spiralling ascension.<p>Kodachi paused, fighting the urge to gasp, "Such... such beauty is above any earthly creature. That is a beauty for me to have and admire alone..." Kodachi held her ribbon above her head, "...even if I must clip those magnificent wings of yours."<p>A blue jewel suddenly appeared upon Ranma's brow, and glowed with an etheral glimmer. Ranma's eyes flashed the same, from gold to oceanic blue, before she suddenly darted at Kodachi. Her wings had pent back, like a hawk diving for prey, as her fists cocked back to her sides, ready to begin the rain of blows.<p>Kodachi laughed; her laugh laden with a damning madness that ran against the rushing angel like a cold arctic wind, causing her to shudder and falter for an instant. That minute breth of time was all Kodachi needed to launch into her counter, lashing out her whip in a mulitude of snaps, making the space the ribbon moved within seem like an angry swarm of bees. Ranma easily could have evaded such an onslaught, if not for the fact that she hadn't truly become accustomed to he added volume of her wings.<p>At Ranma's first cry, the barrage stopped, but not by Kodachi's will. The angel looked up, her arms reddened and dripping blood from lacerations covering them, matching the ones that laced her wings, and found Kodachi's ribbon fluttering to the ground in several pieces. Looking back behind the startled gymnist, Ranma found her father recovering from a thrown vacuum blade.<p>"YOU AGAIN? YOU VILE OGRE, BEGONE!" Kodachi demanded, lobbing several spiked clubs at the stout martial artist. Genma merely snorted, caught each one of them, and launched them back where they came. Laughing maniacally, Kodachi leapt to the air, barely evading the returned attack.<p>"FATHER, YOU MUSTN'T HURT HER!" Ranma pleaded, realizing her father wasn't simply intending to scare the girl. She knew Genma was ignoring her, as he leapt to join he girl in the air for combat.<p>Kodachi detested the very notion of hand to hand combat with such a brute, and already spied a countermeasure. Twisting in the air and altering her momentum, Kodachi fell towards the large pond, where she landed upon the water, standing upon the surface like a biblical messiah.<p>Genma baulked at the display, before rationalizing that she knew the murky water well enough to find a stone foothold within it. Now unimpressed, the stout man arced himself towards the girl, ready to rebound off of whatever perch she found to follow Kodachi into the air, and quickly subdue her.<p>The girl grinned maliciously, as she suddenly leapt back. The instant she did so, reptilian eyes, followed by a reptilian mouth lined with reptilian teeth rose from the water, waiting almos impatiently for the improvised meal.<p>Genma's eyes widened, before he was able to twist in time to avoid falling directly into the alligator's mouth. The deadly reptile's mouth snapped shut, before it dove into the water in pursuit.<p>"NO!" Ranma shouted, as her sudden emotional duress once again caused the newfound jewel upon her forehead to glow brightly. A radiant blast of curellian energy tore into the spot where the alligator had been, parting the waters almost to the bottom as it seared a steaming swath through the surface to the opposite bank.<p>Wide eyed, the angel stepped back at what she had just done, before covering her forehead, and shutting her eyes away from the possible catastrophe. Seeing the opening provided, Kodachi purred deep within her throat, and dove for Ranma, a large mallet handy for rendering her new bounty unconcious.<p>Just before she could reach the angel, the surface of the pond churned, launching forth a stocky and balding martial artist. Genma landed before Ranma, who opened her eyes just long enough for her father to grab onto her, and toss her towards the pond.<p>"WHAT ARE YOU DOI-" Ranma was cut off, as she splashed into the water.<p>Genma wasn't able to recover in time to react to Kodachi's attack directly, and suffered the blow meant for his child. Sliding face-first in the grass, Genma slowly pulled himself up with bleary vision; a sure sign of a concussion. Before he could assess anything else, he felt the crack of heavy wood against the side of his head, felling him once more.<p>"You... you... oaf! Must you repeatedly interfere?" Kodachi demanded, bringing her mallet high above her head, "Allow me to rectify your unfortunate need for intervention."<p>Before the hammer could fall, the sound of air suddenly accellerated, and the smell of ozone drew their attention back to the pond. The water rippled away from the center as if trying to escape the impact of a meteor, while a crimson red beam shot from the center.<p>It broke off as if it were a steady stream of blood cut off from its source, as a dark creature stood in the center, holding the snout of the aligator with both hands on each side. The reptile didn't struggle, possibly because of the gaping hole that passed through its jaw and to the top of its head.<p>With a gutteral growl, the demon launched from the the pond before the waters could enclose back onto him, and flapped its wings to remain airborne. Its fingers dug deeper into the dead animal's snout, drawing more blood, before the devil pulled, ripping it apart.<p>Kodachi stood, breathtaken, as the magnificent being turned its burning eyes towards her, and threw her half of the dead carcus. "It's your damnable pet, you may have it back." With the force of impact, Kodachi was knocked out.<p>Chuckling, the devil landed before Genma, still holding the other half of the alligator. Both stood, staring one another down for several moments, daring the other to make their move. Finally, the devil's smirk grew deeper, "Heh, that was a dangerouus gambit, Pop."<p>Genma continued to glare, not saying a word. The demon's red jewel began to glow upon its forhead in intimidation, but Genma showed no signs of fear. With a derisive snort Ranma turned towards the pond, unleashing he building fury within his brow. The water was once again steaming, and the devil casually strode into its depths.<p>The redheaded angel scrambled from the water, dumbfounded as to what had happened, and turned her confused eyes to her father. "Let's go," Genma only said, before turning away. Ranma looked around, before her shocked expression melted into a somber one. Quietly, she obeyed her father.<p>After the two had left, Sasuke came out of his hiding place, experiencing too much of a conflict of interests to get involved in the ordeal. He quickly made his way to Kodachi, and removed the carcas of her beloved pet from his mistress's blood-drenched form.<p>Kodachi remained as she was, seeming in a daze. In truth, she felt as if she had been struck with a felicity that awed her beyond words. The angel... she was enamoured.<p>With the devil, she was blessed.
