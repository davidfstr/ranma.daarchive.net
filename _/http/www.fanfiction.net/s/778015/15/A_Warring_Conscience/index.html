</div>'A Warring Concience'<p>"But *WHY*?" Nabiki demanded, seeming unreasonably near hysterics.<p>The redhead looked out the window from where she sat on Nabiki's bed, almost basking in he dull moon's rays, "Nabiki, he's a lonely guy who has not even seen his family since his arrival. I have to go, and find out the reason for this."<p>"Ranma, really, they're doing him a FAVOR by staying away from him!" the middle Tendou sister retorted. "The Kuno estate is a place you should avoid at all costs."<p>"Nabiki, I could always go to your sister Akane for where he lives, but I was afraid of her intervention." Ranma replied, using her right hand to softly pet along the frame of her left wing, savoring her own gentle touch.<p>"No, she would give you the same answer I am, 'no deal'!" Reaffirming her position, Nabiki sat in her desk chair, and folded her arms in rebellion.<p>"Nabiki, thank you. I appreaciate the concern for me," Ranma replied, though she didn't understand exactly why Nabiki was so vehemant about it. She turned to face the other girl completely, smiling in an understated fashion that seemed to make her face humbled and glorious, "but this is something that I must do."<p>"No, you do not," Nabiki answered defiantly, "If I had known before hand you were going to visit that idiot in the hospital, I would have ensured the two of you never met." Nabiki closed her eyes, even if her instincts screamed for her to continue looking at the hidden granduer, but she had to have her own mind to continue. As it was, she felt her resolve crumbling, as the angel continued to plead her petition.<p>"Ranma, please understand. The Kunos are a very dangerous, very unstable family. It isn't safe to be around them. Please... please just stay here, where we can protect you."<p>As humbled as Ranma had become since her blessing, a tiny bit of the arrogance that made up the core personality voiced itself to what was almost a challenge to her ability. Ranma's smile turned into a wry smirk that almost looked out of place on the fallen deity, "'Protect me'?"<p>Nabiki continued, feeling her own emotion burn within her like boiling acid, "Ranma if it comes to this, I will do everything within my power to stop you." It hurt to make such a proclimation, as if she were directly defying the gods. But, she knew no good would come of this, and steeled herself.<p>"Nabiki..." the redheaded angel stood up from the bed with the grace of an accomplished ballerina, making the typically uncommemorative action seem like it held epic truths. She almost glided across the floor to the other girl, knelt before her, and pulled her into a hug. Ranma smooth Nabiki's hair, gently forcing the girl to lean against her shoulder, as she whispered into her ear, "Can you please... trust me?"<p>"I do trust you, Ranma," Nabiki replied, before inhaling the fragrance of one that was heaven-touched, the serenity she felt in Ranma's arms was almost enough to still any further words from her, but she feared such silence would be too costly, "It's *them* I don't trust! If anything were to happen to you... I..."<p>"Nothing would happen to me, can I ask for you to believe in me? Even before what I've become, I had been training in the art for the better portion of my life. Believe in me, and trust in my abilities, can you do that for me?"<p>There was no defense against a pleading angel. To reject it was akin to the deepest of sin. Nabiki clung to Ranma, as if the angel would disappear forever, "O...okay, Ranma. I believe in you..."<p>"Thank you." Ranma kissed the girl on the forehead, before smoothing her short, brunette hair out. The angel stood and backed away; the tips of the feathers of her wings lightly brushing against Nabiki's arms and thighs as she retreated.<p>Feeling the freedom of her own sense returning, Nabiki was able to once again comprehend the root of the plight. "Under one condition, Ranma..."<p>The angel nodded, "Very well, Nabiki. What do you want me to do...?"<p>_<p>Though she wished that she hadn't agreed to Nabiki's stipulation, she had to admit it was a fair idea. Her father was cunning, once a petty theif, and oft a coward. For him to accompany Ranma, very little harm would befall either of them in concern to the traps that Nabiki had warned them against. Genma was experienced, even devising his own martial art system based on theivery. Such traps would prove impotent. For their whole trip to their destination, Ranma silently indulged in the security her father's presence offered.<p>They both landed upon the tall stone wall that surrounded the massive grounds. Not too far from the front gate, stood the Kuno manor, both separated by a veritable sea of dense forestry.<p>Ranma looked over at his father, whose cloak flapped in the wind behind him as if he were some comic book vigilante. Just like said crimefighter, Genma's eyes narrowed, as he studied the path.<p>After but a few moments, Genma spoke, "Wait here." Genma faded away, like a illusion dispelled.<p>It was an impressive technique, Ranma had to admit, as some part of her longed to learn the Umisenken. Her reverie was disturbed, as the sounds of branches breaking, metal clashing with metal, projectiles whistling through the air, wires breaking, and stone crumbling could be heard.<p>"Nabiki apparently wasn't kidding about the traps," Ranma said out loud, just as she saw her father walk out into the open, facing towards her, and holding a miniscule man by the scruff of his neck.<p>"It's safe now," Genma stated, letting Ranma know she could now approach without concern.<p>"Who?" Ranma enquired, ensuring to keep her own cloak tight around her, as she leapt into the yard.<p>"Who dares trespass upon the private asylum of the Kuno family? Let them show fear before the noble family retainer, Sasuke!" the miniscule man proclaimed, as he thrashed in Genma's grip.<p>Ranma would be forgiven for not taking such a threat too seriously, "I'm sorry if we've inconvinenced you. I am a friend of one of your masters, Tatewake Kuno."<p>Sasuke stopped his impotent struggles, and looking incredulously at the girl who seemed to be keeping her distance, "Master Tatewake has friends?" His slip up was quickly corrected, "I mean, of COURSE he has friends! He is but the noble scion of the house of Kuno! People flock in droves to be friends with his greatness!"<p>"That's it, I'm going to throw him into the pond, so we can get continue with our business," Genma announced, winding up to launch the Kuno family retainer into the nearby body of water.<p>Apparently, Sasuke did not like the idea one bit, "NO! ANYWHERE BUT THERE! TOSS ME INTO THE POISON SPIKE PIT! DUMP ME INTO THE ACID BATH, BUT NOT THERE!"<p>"Pop," Ranma commanded in a gentle, but firm tone.<p>Genma rolled his eyes, but released the man.<p>Ranma knelt to the man in ninja garb, who was currently hugging her father's leg in thanks, "I came, because I was concerned for your master Tatewake. Is there any of the family around that I may speak with? I'm Ranma Saotome, and this is my father."<p>Sasuke stopped his groveling, and slowly turned to look at the girl. Her voice... it was a symphony that moved of love, contentment, and eternal peace, baratoned with just at hint of turmoil and suffering. That voice, it almost seemed as if it were what he had been searching for all his life, the voice that promised of peace.<p>Sasuke valiantly fought the urge to bow, as his mouth went dry, before he finally remembered to breath, and reply. "Y-yes... I shall lead you to his sister."<p>As the miniscule man quickly scrambled to his feet, eager to please the being before him, Genma narrowed his eyes, continuing to search the grounds like a hawk. Since Ranma's curse, she had noticed Genma was much less trusting than before. True, he wasn't the most trusting man in the past, given his lifestyle, but nowadays he seemed as if the only person he would ever rely upon was himself. Even if Ranma was faithful that the servant of the Kunos would lead them through the myraid of traps that had yet to be tripped, Genma believed that faith to be misplaced.<p>Much to Ranma's relief and her father's slight chagrin, the short trip to the front door was wholly uneventful. Sasuke scampered to open the door for them; stepping aside as if he were emitting the very royal family of Japan. Ranma didn't allow the manservant to see her face fully, but favored him with a small smile in gratitude that could be seen peeking from her hood. Sasuke bowed, bowed deeply, and feared to rise lest he upset the girl in any potential fashion.<p>It was Genma's voice that snapped him out of his worshipping. "If you're done, you were taking us to whomever is around?"<p>"Y-yes, master Saotome. Right at once!" With haste, Sasuke led them into the mansion, yet it couldn't be told if his haste was due to his eagerness to please the visiting girl, or fear of facing Genma's ire once again. Almost five minutes, they had arrived at their destination.<p>"Mistress Kodachi, there are some guests here in concern for your brother."<p>The girl with ink-black hair in an elaborate rose embroidered kimono didn't even turn to acknowledge their presence, as she knelt at a small table, "If I recalled, I requested that I not be disturbed, and I have no interest in my brother's condition. He is well, that is all I require of that knowledge."<p>"You're his sister?" Ranma enquired in an incredulous, saddened tone, "Don't you care about him?"<p>Just the voice, the voice caught her attention, holding it in a vice. Kodachi was enthralled by the lyrical property of it that soothed any emotions within her like a cool balm against heated skin. She hadn't even caught what the voice was demanding, for she was simply lost in it.<p>With eyes wide, Kodachi turned to gawk at the redhead that stared back with eyes leagues deep with concern. At what she had seen and heard, Kodachi knew not how to handle the experience. Because of this, she fell back on the one reaction she had conditioned herself for far too often, a condition developed by those who were given everything, and knew no lacking. At the sight of what could only be described as an angel from the heavens, Kodachi could only grasp her need for posession...
