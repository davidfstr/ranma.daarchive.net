</div>'A Warring Conscience'<p>"Thank you, nurse," Tatewake responded, as he continued to sit in the chair by his bed, staring out the hospital window. There wasn't anything particularly interesting to look at; the gray clouded sky, enhanced by Tokyo's ever-present smog, provided a background to the cityscape. Nerima's own buildings were not the gargantuan monoliths of the southern districts, but they provided a sensory distraction that Kuno appreciated. It was something far intriguing to study than the soft blue walls of the room he had been moved into, something that put him at ease much more effectively than the sterile, spartan furnishings around him. Not even a vase of flowers decorated his current domicile.<p>Not a single gift, get well card, or personal item had provided any distraction to the bland room. If he had been his past arrogant, obnoxious, and wholly oblivious self, he would have rationalized an excuse, such as the peasants were too awed by him to even comprehend a fitting gift. As he was now, he would greatly appreciate a sole wilting flower; close in the throes of leaving its suffocating life.<p>He shifted his head slightly at the soft, almost imperceptible sound of glass being gently set on wood, and looked towards the night table by his bed. "I'm sorry, I didn't want to disturb you while you were thinking," Ranma apologized, as she pulled her hand away from the small glass vase with a single yellow rose in it.<p>Tatewake's eyebrow rose as he smiled, as he took note at how vibrant the flower seemed. "Please, do not apologize. Your company is worth more than a moment's reverie..." It was then the young man noticed Ranma's companion, "...Nabiki..."<p>The middle Tendou sister's scowl never diminished, as her presence was acknowledged. Kuno could sense her eyes silently accusing him of some effrontery; the animosity she was favoring him with was palpable. Both of these he could understand, since he still felt the tremendous shame of his actions against the redheaded angel. What perplexed him was the poorly veiled jealousy that remained trapped within the dark chocolate irises of Nabiki, hammering its way out in an attempt to be known.<p>After several moments pause, Kuno came out of the daze he didn't realize he had fallen into, "I'm sorry, forgive my lapse. Please sit, both of you."<p>Ranma subtly smiled and nodded, before taking a seat on the well made bed. Nabiki chose not to take Kuno on his offer, and leaned against the wall, watching him tightly and almost angrily. "I thought the flower would cheer you up," Ranma started, smiling sheepishly, "I'm afraid I couldn't afford much more, I never had much money as it is." The cloaked angel favored Nabiki with a scant glance, neither accusing nor forgiving. It wasn't often that Ranma asked for favors, but Nabiki outright refused to lend her a yen towards Kuno. It was more than just refusal; Ranma feared that Nabiki was willing to curse the young man's name if the angel pushed the point.<p>Kuno genuinely smiled, "Thank you, it is more than grand enough." He appreciated the gesture more than he knew she realized, but understood her enough not to gush on about it. "Not to sound unappreciative, even in the least, but for what reason is it that you grace me with your presence?"<p>Ranma bowed her head, allowing her cloak to hide her face further than her bangs did, "I... I had gone to speak with your sister."<p>"WHAT?" Kuno shouted, attempting to bring himself to stand, and nearly collapsing to the floor.<p>"Hey, easy, easy!" Ranma moved with the grace and speed that angels and masters of the art could only be gifted with, catching Tatewake and arresting his decent. She then helped him into his chair.<p>"Ranma, why would you do such a thing?"<p>"I thought that... I just thought that you would appreciate it if she were to come by at least. It sounded like you missed her, last we talked."<p>Kuno cursed himself, wishing he hadn't even made a passing mention of his sibling. "If I had known your intended course of action, I would have forbid it, but I guess it cannot be helped now." Kuno looked at the divine-blessed redhead, "I shall pass warning, I cannot truly be aware of the boundaries of my lunacy, but I assure you, hers is much worse."<p>"That's definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black."<p>"Nabiki, please," Ranma pleaded, just above a whisper. The other girl appeared heavily chastised, but her posture returned to unsocial when she turned her glare back to Kuno. Assured that her companion would remain quiet, Ranma continued, "Yeah, I saw that."<p>The wry smile she favored Tatewake with did little to quell his anxiousness, which would make the next subject the angel wanted to breach all the more difficult, "Kuno... I... I also kinda wanted to find out about..."<p>Kuno urged Ranma on, "What is it you wished to learn that you could not have discovered from me?"<p>Ranma closed her cerulean blue eyes that seemed to dim with the pain she felt she shared from the boy, "Drugs... I was told that you were on drugs."<p>Both Tatewake and Nabiki seemed stricken at the statement. Kuno understood that it was a statement, not an accusation, but felt the pressing urge to defend himself, "I, on my honor, would never sully my body with such detestable substances." Kuno stared directly at Ranma, allowing her to see his piercing, firm gaze, "You have my utmost word on that."<p>"You're lying!" Nabiki accused; it all made sense now. Kuno's behavior, his harassment other sister, that was most assuredly the reason. Kuno didn't deserve Ranma's sympathy; he didn't deserve to be in her presence. Nabiki felt elation at the revelation; Kuno was far worse than her; completely undeserving of the angel's attention.<p>"Nabiki"<p>The middle Tendou daughter's eyes shifted from the accusing, defiant, and smug glare directed at Tatewake, to confused, startled, and apologetic she favored Ranma with. The redheaded deity returned an expression that was admonishing and disheartened; greater than any admonishing look from Kasumi, more hurtful than the distrusting looks of her fellow students, and more intense than an angry scowl from Akane.<p>Ranma continued with Nabiki's attention, "Please, he doesn't need to be accused of anything."<p>Even after she was finished, Ranma continued to stare at Nabiki, an expression of... disappointment that lay under the expression of acceptance that Nabiki had grown accustomed to. Unable to take it, Nabiki decided to take her leave, "I'm going to..to see how your father's doing." Quickly, she left the room.<p>Ranma bowed her head, wishing Nabiki would have cast aside the animosity she had carried with her into the room. I'm sorry about that."<p>Kuno shook his head, "Do not be. Her ill will towards me is quite justified. I only wish I will be able to make amends to her and her sister for the strife I have given them in the past."<p>Ranma nodded, "Don't blame yourself. You didn't know about the drugs?"<p>Kuno snorted, "It doesn't surprise me. You have met my sister. I would think she heavily suspect."<p>Ranma didn't like the accusation anymore than she liked it when Nabiki accused him, "Tatewake, that isn't fair."<p>"I had insisted she stop preparing meals for me long ago," Kuno began, "My father had stopped eating her cuisines, that was what begat my suspicion. I'm not sure how she may still be doing it, but I will have to remain vigilant."<p>Ranma understood what he was implying, "This has been going on for a while?" Kuno nodded. "I'm sorry," Ranma apologized, "If I had known-"<p>"It would have still been too late for you to have done more than you have for me now." Kuno gave Ranma an appreciative smile, filled with humility and gratitude, "I do not think distainfully of my sister, and I request you do the same. It is because she is a victim of her own habits and insecurities that drives her to actions."<p>"I'm not mad at her," Ranma responded, almost sorrowfully, "In fact; I only wish I could have done more for her."<p>"She can be helped, but please, let me find another to take care of it," the young man pleaded, "She is far too unstable, and she can act in disregards to anyone's safety... much as I shamefully had."<p>Ranma didn't say anymore, simply staring at Kuno, as he looked out the window for several minutes; silently providing her company to him when no one else would. Kuno smiled, only visible through the slight reflection of the window to the angel. His angel, his goddess graces him with her presence, and he was indeed grateful for it. Her companionship made him feel loved, far from the imagined and disillusioned love he presumed from Akane and most other girls during his... time of confusion, it was warmth that made him feel that he was never alone, that someone out there did care for him.<p>The sensation had been lacking since his mother had died. He was sure that his father indeed cared for him, as did his sister to a certain extent, but the elder Kuno had practically abandoned them, as his sister's sanity made her endearment questionable. For that sensation, for that love, Kuno felt that he would give eternal servitude to the redhead, that anything; his heart if she asked, his sword if she requested, his life if she demanded, would be given freely. But... he knew she would never ask these things, with only one request that he himself be happy. He didn't feel he could love her as a lover would, and doubted she would want that from him, much like Akane hadn't, but he was content with her friendship.<p>He didn't need the cards of his friends, or the concern from his family, he was glad for Ranma's company. "Thank you."<p>Without question, Ranma knew what he was thanking her for. With a smile, she nodded, "You're welcome."<p>Kuno took a deep breath and sighed, before turning to look at the clock, "Visiting hours will be up shortly, and I will look forward to your returning."<p>Ranma smiled deeply, a smile that lit the sky beyond the clouds like the warm sun, "Sure."<p>"Ranma, before you leave, may I speak with Nabiki." Kuno turned to find Ranma's expression unsure, "Please?"<p>After a moment's hesitation, Ranma nodded again, and left the room. A few minutes later, Nabiki returned, more subdued and timid than he had ever expected of her. "Nabiki, is something amiss?"<p>At Kuno's voice, she scowled, "Yes, you!"<p>Tatewake nodded once in apparent understanding, "I wish to apologize to you and your sister. If possible, I would like to make amends."<p>"Amends?" Nabiki parroted incredulously, "You think you can make amends for the harassment of my sister? You think you can buy me forgiveness?"<p>"I wouldn't dream of attempting a monetary assuagement towards you," Kuno responded calmly, "Nabiki, I've known you since we both attended the same elementary school, and we had at least a friendship then."<p>Kuno swallowed, as if he were forcing his pride down his throat, "I would like that friendship again. Even if we had grown distant over time, you were a good friend."<p>Nabiki narrowed her eyes, "Sorry Kuno, but you can't erase the past."<p>"Do not think yourself a saint, Nabiki," Tatewake countered, allowing his own frustration and hurt guide his words, "I had the excuse of influential substances to explain my actions... and I regret them now." His eyes almost pierced Nabiki to the core, "What be your reason? I doubt your sister is aware of our business transactions."<p>"HOW..." Nabiki calmed herself before yelling, "How dare you. You can't judge me! You have no right to!"<p>Kuno bowed his head, "You're correct, and I apologize. All I wish is that you at least give me a chance at redemption."<p>Nabiki stared at Kuno for the longest of moments, before she turned, and strode out the room, leaving the injured kendoist staring sorrowfully at her path of retreat.
