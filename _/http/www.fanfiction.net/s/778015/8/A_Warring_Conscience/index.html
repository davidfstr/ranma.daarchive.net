</div>Ranma/ Tekken<br/>'A Warring Concience'<br/>Part 7<p>"And you don't even realize the harm you cause..." The Devil snorted with a sinister leer on his face.<p>"How do you assume that I bring harm to those two girls?" the Angel asked, curiously, though not putting much stock into the devil's accusations.<p>"That is something that works to my advantage. Why should I give that up?"<p>"Why?" the Angel repeated, "If, indeed I am doing a grave disservice to Akane and Nabiki, would you allow your hunger for a valueless revenge to put them in jeopordy?"<p>"That is an astute question, is it not?" The Devil's grin got wider.<p>"This is childish," the Angel retorted, and then sighed.<p>"Perhaps, but I shall still capitalize on your folly, Fallen One."<p>"Good morning, Ranma," Akane greeted to the redhead in a more sanguine voice than Soun or Kasumi had ever heard from her. It wasn't that it sounded 'happier', but that it was much more genuine than she had ever put forth in such a while.<p>"Hello, Akane-chan," Ranma replied, putting on her own smile in return, "I guess you're having a good morning?"<p>Akane's smile grew softer, "Yes, thank you."<p>Ranma knew what she was thanking her for, "You're welcome, Akane."<p>"Ranma..." Soun started, walking in from the kitchen where he and Kasumi were eating their breakfast, "Do you intend on going back to school, today?"<p>"I... do not think that would be the best of ideas," the angel replied with a sigh, "Perhaps I can attend by correspondence?"<p>"I'll look into that," Soun said with a nod of approval.<p>"If you could, I would also like for Lin Lin and Ran Ran to be able to have their schooling."<p>"Big-Sister..." Lin Lin started.<p>"Ranma?" Ran Ran finished.<p>Ranma gave the two girls flanking her a gentle smile a piece, "We do not know how long you may be in what you consider 'the outside world', so it would probably be best if you did so." Both girls groaned at the idea.<p>"That's a wonderful idea," Akane enthuesed, "It would be good if you had something to do than watch Ranma all the time."<p>"Is our job," Ran Ran replied with a slight tilt of her head, "What more we need to do?"<p>"Maybe so, but school is very important," Ranma lightly admonished the girls.<p>"But we warriors who want no more than protect Ranma from inside-demon!"<p>Ranma cast her eyes downward, after noting the almost fanatical expression on Lin Lin's faceand tone in her voice. "Breakfast was delicious, Kasumi," Ranma called out to the kitchen. The angel then stood up, and patted Lin Lin lightly on the head, "Has anyone woken up Nabiki, yet?"<p>"Oh, she likes to sleep in, but it would be time for her to wake up," Kasumi stated.<p>"I'll go check up on her, then," Ranma offered, before heading up the stairs with the two Amazon girls in tow.<p>Ranma arrived at Nabiki's door, and knocked, "Nabiki? Are you awake?" After getting no reply, she gently opened the door, and entered to find Nabiki still comfortably sleeping. Her alarm clock was buzzing, signifying that it was time for her to be up, but being ignored for it's troubles. Ranma shook her head, causing a few tresses of her copper-glowing red hair to drift to the for of her soft white face. She opened her pure crystal blue eyes that reflected the light of the smile upon her mouth, and motioned for the two Amazon girls to stay out of the room. She gently closed the door, and then walked up to Nabiki's bed. Ranma turned off the alarm clock, and shook Nabiki lightly, "Hey, you have school today, you know? You can't be sleeping in like this."<p>When she recieved no answer, Ranma snorted slightly, and shook her a bit more firmly, "Nabiki, you're going to be late if you-eep!" Ranma found herself pulled onto the still sleeping Nabiki by her arm suddenly, and now had the other girl's arm's wrapped around her ribs, and leg wrapped around her thigh. Ranma gulped at the sensation, even through her pants and Nabiki's pajamas, but calmed down as she stared at Nabiki's peaceful expression. She had to wake the other girl up for school, but... she couldn't break herself away from the girl's face. In fact, Ranma found herself moving closer to it, and her lips pursing...<p>"Ranma, is you wake Nabiki?"<p>Ranma had to both thank and curse Ran Ran for the interruption, and attempted to pull herself away... 'attempt' being the notable word.<p>"Ah... help?" Ranma mewed weakly, finding Nabiki's grip far stronger than she had anticipated. Lin Lin and Ran Ran opened the door again, and both had to smirk at the sight.<p>"Ranma move too, too fast," Lin Lin chided.<p>"Funny," Ranma retorted, again trying to pull herself from Nabiki's grasp, "If you may...?"<p>Lin Lin and Ran Ran both nodded, and then left the room. Ranma blinked, wondering how her request was miscommunicated and where her two bodyguards were going. She then squeeked, as Nabiki pulled her back down, cuddling her like a human teddy bear.<p>"Ranma say Nabiki no feel well, she take care of her," Lin Lin relayed to Soun.<p>"I see..." Soun replied, wondering what may have happened to Nabiki.<p>"Ranma is so caring," Ran Ran added with a chuckle her sister joined in on.<p>"Yes, she is," Akane also added with a sigh and a small care-free smile that Ran Ran and Lin Lin didn't miss.<p>"I see you two are in a good mood, that means you'll put the extra effort into this morning's training." Both girls stopped their giggling at the elder Saotome's voice, and turned around to face him.<p>Genma apparently wasn't as angry as he was last night, but his iron-stern expression told them that it wasn't going to be an easy rest of the morning. With a resigned nod, both girls went to the dojo to begin warmup exercises.<p>"Saotome, I hope you will be lenient on them?" Soun warned.<p>"They'll be fine, Tendou, but I am going to update their training," Genma replied in a conversational tone, "You could watch if you'd like."<p>"I think I shall," the Tendou Patrairch replied, "Akane, if you would, can you check up on your sister to see how she is faring?"<p>"Okay, Dad," Akane rushed upstairs quickly, so that she could say bye to Ranma, and quickly check on Nabiki before she got to school.<p>"Nabiki, are you feeling... okay?" Akane paused, at the sight of Ranma laying on top of Nabiki, with her hands on the older girl's shoulders in an attempt to pry herself out of Nabiki's grasp without hurting her. Akane thought the pleading expression on Ranma's angelic face was so adorable, and walked towards Nabiki's desk, and opened the top left drawer.<p>"Um, Akane, if you can... give me a little help?"<p>::Click::<p>Nabiki's oak hued eyes fluttered open at the sound of her own camera. They then stayed open, staring up at Ranma. Nabiki allowed a relaxed smile to cross her tired looking face, "Good Morning, Ranma..."<p>"Ah, this isn't what it would appear to be..." Ranma told Nabiki nervously. The older girl gave Ranma a puzzled expression, before she realized, much to her subconcious pleasure, that Ranma was on top of her, and she had her arms around the angel's ribs just below where the wings joined her back.<p>"And, how did this happen?" Nabiki asked, raising an eyebrow to compliment the smirk on her face.<p>"I was trying to wake you up for school," Ranma stated in a dry tone. The reply caused Nabiki to quickly turn to look at her alarm clock, causing her to squawk in dismay, and toss Ranma to the side onto her bed. Akane watched her sister rush through out the room, quickly getting ready for school. She didn't have the heart to tell Nabiki she put her blouse on inside-out.<p>Once Nabiki was out the door of the room, Ranma finally blinked, "That... was peculiar." Akane nodded, and giggled at Ranma's bewildered expression.<p>Akane walked up to the school, her happy expression never faltering, even as she saw the line-up of the idiot squad. As she got to the gates, they charged, shouting their usual idiocies and proclimations. Akane stood calmly at the school gates, surprising everyone witness in the usual morning madness, when it suddenly got even madder...<p>With but a simplistic gesture and a single calmly spoken word, Akane had frozen all the boys charging to the spot.<p>"Stop."<p>"Now, if I have your attention?" Akane enquired, lowering her hand from raising it for a pause from the attack, "I would just like to say, if you do want to date me, all you have to do is ask me... politely."<p>The words from Akane's mouth were so powerful, even moreso than her raised hand, as it would lock the boys in their spots, as their minds attempted to wrap around what they were just told. The only movement they made, was to part so that Akane could happily walk towards the entrance of the school, with just a little more bounce in her skip.<p>Ranma leaned out the window of the guest room, catching the light sounds of Lin Lin and Ran Ran training with her father. The angel sighed to herself, keeping the recollection of Nabiki's scent in her mind; the soft smell of a lavender soap she used the night before, mixed with the fair tint of her cotton pajammas. She pressed herself tighter against the windowsill, as she could still feel her body against the older girls; slightly different in tactile sensation than it was when Akane embraced her the night before.<p>Akane's own smell consisted of the light body spray she put on after her own shower that had a luscious fruited aroma to it that Ranma could almost taste on the girl's lips. The redheaded angel had to wonder what Kasumi's was like. The eldest Tendou sister would probably feel softer against her, as she didn't have the lithness that Nabiki had, or the muscle tone of Akane's heavily exercised facade or Lin Lin and Ran Ran's well toned and still budding bodies...<p>Ranma groaned, and leaned forward out the window. The thoughts running through her mind were sensual, not sexual, but she had to gripe about those thoughts belonging to her guy body, not a girl's, even an angel's. Then again, she was truly a guy, so it had to be okay.<p>The young angel had to admit, though, that it did take her mind off her current woes, and she enjoyed thinking about the other girls. It brought a comforting warmth to her that radiated in her like a soothing light in a foggy night. She wondered what Nabiki and Akane were doing at school at the moment, and what Kasumi was up to. She concerned herself with Lin Lin and Ran Ran's welfare, but didn't think her father would go too far in the morning training... without her noticing anything drastic being set up, at least.<p>Her face was slightly brighter with the smile that graced it. Ranma had found something to take her own personal joy in; the love she had for the girls around her. And if she could break through to Kasumi, the love they all would return for her.
