</div>Megumi's Wish<br/>An Oh My Goddess / Ranma 1/2 Crossover fanfiction<p>by mrthou<p>Disclaimer: Based on characters and situations created by Kosuke Fujishima (Oh My Goddess!) and Rumiko Takahashi (Ranma 1/2). They are used here without permission, but without intent of profit.<p>Chapter 3<p>It was a week and a half into the new quarter, and Ranma was finally beginning to feel like he fit in. The apartment party had been great; Ranma discovered that several of his fellow students were actually really cool people, Megumi especially.<p>Then, over the weekend he had met with the current captains of the various martial arts clubs, and after presenting his credentials obtained permission to act as an instructor for the Kempo club and the Aikido club.<p>He'd also had a chance to see Tatewake Kuno again, and managed to have a rather civil and almost friendly conversation. Kuno had dropped the ego and the poetry, and hadn't once blamed Ranma for anything involving the accident, for which he was greatly relieved - it wasn't an event Ranma wanted to dwell on. All in all, the change of scenery was doing Kuno a world of good. Ranma too, for that matter.<p>Ranma had eaten lunch with Megumi on Monday. She was fast becoming a very good friend, something Ranma felt he needed badly. He hadn't had any really good friends since the accident, except for Ryoga, and he was never around. Tuesday he'd hung out with some of the guys from the Kempo club, and taught his first class to some of the less experienced members.<p>Now it was Wednesday, a day the whole campas, Ranma included, was looking forward to, because today was the campus festival.<p>The school festival was quite a thing to see; a clash of colors, shapes, and sounds that seemed to blend together to form a general sort of noise, both visual and aural. Vendors were scattered about, selling snacks and drinks. Clubs raucously shouted at passers-by, each one with a gimmick or trick to try to attract members. Some dressed up as animals, some had scantily clad women. The chess club had somehow managed to start a human-sized chess game.<p>It was all more than a little silly, Ranma mused. Those who were interested in a particular club were going to join regardless of the display, and those who joined because of the display were likely to drop out pretty quickly.<p>The club fair was really a form competition, and not much else. It existed so each club could say, "Look, we had XXX number of people join our club!" even though the numbers were meaningless.<p>Ranma was currently passing through what could probably be called the "team sports" section. There were people shouting, "Join the baseball club" or "Soccer club here!" Strangely enough, there was even a lacross team, whatever that was. It even seemed to be attracting a fair amount of attention as the club members tossed little balls back and forth with strange looking nets.<p>The baseball club had managed to catch his eye; not because Ranma was really interested in baseball, but rather because they had a radar gun set up next to their stage. People were lining up to take their best shot at pitching. It looked moderately interesting, so Ranma joined the line.<p>Megumi came running over dressed in a white softball uniform. "Hey, Ranma, what's up?"<p>Ranma pointed at the radar setup. "Thought I'd try my hand at that. I've always kinda wondered how fast I could throw things. What's with the uniform?"<p>"Oh, this? I told you I was captain of the softball club, didn't I?"<p>"Yeah, you did, didn't you?" They watched for a moment as the next person pitched.<p>"87 miles per hour!" shouted the man holding the gun. "New high for the day!"<p>The young man who had thrown the ball turned to the crowd and grinned while his friends cheered.<p>"87, that's pretty good," Megumi said.<p>"I can beat that," Ranma replied. "He didn't throw it all that hard."<p>"Yeah, right, Saotome. I'll believe it when I see it."<p>They waited as two more people took their turns, posting highs of 72 and 69. Then it was Ranma's turn.<p>The guy running the booth handed Ranma 3 baseballs. "You have three throws. We'll tell you the speed after each throw, and post your high on the board, if it's in the top five. Just aim for the target."<p>"No prob."<p>Ranma decided it might look suspicious if he threw as hard as he actually could. Normal people weren't used to seeing someone move that fast. So when he cocked his arm back and threw, it was only about two thirds of what he could manage.<p>"89!" came the shout. "New high for the day!" There was a round of clapping.<p>Ranma threw again, a little harder this time. The ball flew out of his hand and smacked the center of the target on the tarp.<p>The baseball player holding the radar gun whistled loudly. "94 miles per hour." There was more applause, a little louder this time. Several of the other baseball players crowded around the one with the gun, trying to get a closer look.<p>Ranma threw his third and final ball, still holding back, but a little bit harder than before. It, too, hit the center of the bulls-eye.<p>There was silence for a moment, and one holding the gun said, "It doesn't have enough digits."<p>There was a whole lot of talking at once as the baseball team argued about what it meant. Finally, one of them announced the results. "It appears that this person - what's your name?"<p>"Ranma Saotome," Ranma replied.<p>"- Ranma Saotome has a new high for the day. 104 miles per hour."<p>There was a great deal of commotion while various people congratulated him and others asked if he would be joining the team. Ranma waved a few times and answered that he wasn't considering it.<p>"My gosh, Ranma how'd you do that?" Megumi asked after she had recovered from the shock of his performance. "That's harder than anyone in the majors pitches!"<p>"Yep, but they can throw the ball over the plate. I'm not sure if I could, and I'm not interested in finding out."<p>"You're lying, Saotome," Megumi replied. "You hit the target every time. And besides, I can tell when people are lying to me."<p>"I kinda doubt that," he said. "But still, you're right. I wasn't even throwin' as hard as I could."<p>"You mean you could throw faster?" Megumi asked incredulously.<p>"I just said that."<p>"Hmm... you'll have to show me sometime. Well, I've gotta get going. Gotta go recruit some more members for the softball team," Megumi said. "If you wanna go say 'hi' to my brother, he's with the Motor Club on the other side of campas, over by the engineering building."<p>"I'll be sure to do that. You gonna come watch my demonstration for the Kempo club?"<p>"Sure," Megumi replied. "2:30, right?"<p>"Yup."<p>Megumi waved and ran off, and Ranma found himself alone, with an hour and a half to kill.<p>So he wandered around, visiting booths here and there. He won a pair of two-and-a-half foot long chopsticks in a rice eating contest, and lost a game of ping pong rather spectacularly to Urd. He was impressed: she was fast, almost as fast as he was. His initial impression was correct. Urd was someone to take very seriously.<p>Eventually, he made his way over to the motor club's stage. He talked with Belldandy for a bit, since Keiichi was busy helping set up the stage for a proformance that looked to be loud, flashy, probably dangerous, and definitely stupid. It looked like they were going to have some sort of plane take off, or something like that.<p>Ranma left rather quickly, because for some reason Belldandy made him feel rather nervous. He wasn't sure why, but every time he was near her, his danger sense went haywire. Oh, well, he'd learn to deal with it, eventually. Just not right now. Ranma made his way back to the sports area, and joined the rest of the Kempo club members, who were already warming up for the performance.<p>-<p>Megumi was very pleased with how the sign-ups had gone. There seemed to be a genuine interest in softball, and so far fifteen additional girls had penned their name for a spot on the team. The team needed another pitcher, but the other positions were all filled.<p>Megumi left the stand in the capable hands of the second captain, and ran across campus to the auto club booth, stopping at a convienient restroom to change out of her softball uniform and into something a little more suited for working with machinery. She'd agreed to help them with their show, but that wasn't for another hour.<p>Watching Ranma's performance with the baseball club had lent a lot of credibility to a few of the stories he'd told her. He had said that he was a world-class martial artist, and at first she thought he was bragging. But Ranma's sense of humor seemed to be too self-depricating for him to be lying outright. Maybe it really was possible to throw 50 punches in a second, or jump twelve feet into the air, like on some of those cheesy samurai dramas. She certainly hadn't thought anyone his size could throw a baseball over a hundred miles per hour.<p>Well, she'd find out later. Right now she had to drag her brother away from his pet project for a while. Get him to relax a little, maybe.<p>"Hey Kei! Hows's it going?" she called as she approached.<p>Keiichi waved back at her. "Not too bad. I'm a little nervous, though."<p>"I'm not surprised. You know how to fly that thing?"<p>"More or less," he answered. "It's the landing that's got me worried."<p>"I'm sure you'll do just fine, dear," Belldandy said. "So what brings you over here so early, Megumi? We weren't expecting you for another half-hour."<p>"You guys have gotta come see this."<p>"See what?" Keiichi asked.<p>"Ranma's going to give a demonstration of his martial arts over on the soccer field. I'm guessing it'll be pretty amazing."<p>"Why do you say that?" Keiichi asked.<p>"Supposedly he's a Master of Kempo," Megumi replied. "Something like 8th dan, or something. I'm not quite sure what that means, but Yuriko said it was really high."<p>"Ah. Sure, I'll come. I need to relax a bit anyway," Keiichi said. "I'd better bring a towel, though."<p>"A towel, Keiichi?" Belldandy asked.<p>"What for?" Megumi said.<p>"To wipe up the drool, sister dear," Keiichi replied.<p>"I do not drool, brother dear," Megumi answered. "Last time I checked, that was your particular social Faux Pas."<p>Keiichi laughed nervously. "You still remember that, huh?"<p>"Of course I remember. It wasn't all *that* long ago. Should I tell..." Megumi made a gesture towards Belldandy that she couldn't see.<p>"Tell me what, Megumi?" Belldandy asked.<p>"Oh, nothing. Just something that happened in high school. I'm sure he'll tell you about it sometime."<p>"Yeah, yeah. Let's get going," Keiichi said. And with that, he tucked the towel under his arm and stalked off toward the soccer field. Belldandy and Megumi followed.<p>-<p>Ranma had decided that for this performance, at least, he wouldn't do anything too flashy. No, he'd do something rather simple: one of the kempo kata he frequently used as a warm-up exercise. Of course, Ranma's definition of a simple kata was something that would tie an ordinary person into knots and give even some masters problems.<p>The kata on its own, however, would be too boring, so Ranma decided he'd do it on top of a chain-link fence.<p>Okay, maybe it was a *little* flashy. But only just a little.<p>Ranma completed his warm-up stretches and looked around at some of the other club-members. "How long," Ranma asked.<p>"Any time, sensei," one of the students replied.<p>"Okay, Tetsuo, go out there and announce me." Ranma smirked. "And open the curtain when wind-bag over there wraps it up."<p>Tetsuo grumbled a bit at the wind-bag comment, but then stepped out from behind the curtain, to address the gathered masses.<p>"Ladies and Gentleman," he called out with a megaphone, "your attention please. Our newest instructor, Ranma Saotome, has graciously volunteered to do a little demonstration. I should warn you, though, it is not for the faint of heart. If any of you are prone to fainting, you might want to leave now, for what you are about to see is, to put is succinctly, death-defying."<p>"Get on with it!" someone shouted from the audience.<p>"Er... yes. Anyway, without further ado, I present to you our sensei, Master of the School of Indiscriminate Grappling, Eighth dan in the Art of Kempo, and one time winner of the King of Nerima fighting tournament... Ranma Saotome!"<p>The curtain opened, but Ranma Saotome wasn't there. Instead, he was already on the fence, eight feet above the stage, and a good ten feet off the ground altogether.<p>And then he began.<p>-<p>To say that Megumi and her companions were impressed was an understatement. Rather, they, and the rest of the crowd, were absolutely floored. Even Belldandy seemed shocked, and Belldandy was one of the hardest people to surprise that Megumi knew. The skill that Ranma seemed to be pushing the very limits of human ability.<p>Megumi was having a hard time believing that a person could move as fast as Ranma was moving. Oh, intellectually she could accept it. After all, the evidence was right before her eyes. But in every other way it was possible to believe something, she couldn't. He was simply too fast. His punches and kicks struck thin air a furious pace, his whole body seemed to blur as he moved back and forth. She kept on expecting to hear thunder as the air was rapidly displaced and replaced by his hands and feet.<p>And to add to the disbelief, he was doing it all on a fence no more than an inch and a half wide.<p>Suddenly, 'world-class martial artist' seemed like an understatement.<p>Finally, Ranma's kata wound down, and he jumped off the fence with a double flip to land on the stage. He bowed to a thunderous applause.<p>Megumi looked at her watch. Five minutes. Five minutes had passed since he started. It had seemed like much longer than that.<p>"I recognize him, now," Belldandy said.<p>"Huh?" Keiichi replied intelligently.<p>"The name. It's been bothering me for a while, but now I know who he is."<p>"Ah. Okay. Well, I have to admit, that was one heck of a performance," Keiichi said. "Have to admire the Kempo club's tactics. They'll rake in the new members with a performance like that. Not to mention the cash."<p>Megumi just stared at the stage, where Ranma was still taking his bows. She felt something soft dabbing at the corner of her mouth. Absently she swiped at it with her hand.<p>Wait. Something dabbing at her mouth.<p>The word white wandered through her mind, in search of something to connect with. The dabbing stopped, and something passed in front of her face.<p>"Towel," she murmured. Then it hit her, literally, and draped itself over her head.<p>She ripped the towel off her head and growled, "Kei-i-chi..."<p>Keiichi was laughing uproariously at her. Belldandy was doing her best to stifle a giggle.<p>"Ha ha! Sorry, couldn't resist!" He continued to laugh.<p>Belldandy managed to get her giggling under control and apologized for her boyfriend.<p>"No, it's not your fault my brother has a warped sense of humor, Belldandy." Megumi glanced at her laughing brother, then turned her attention back to Bell. "Besides, you have siblings, too. So you know what it's like. I'll just have to one-up him later."<p>"That's very true," Belldandy said. "I've been on the recieving end of Urd's jokes on more than one occasion."<p>"And you've gotten back at her, too, right?"<p>"Well, in a manner of speaking..." Belldandy blushed with embarrasment.<p>"Ooh, you'll have to tell me about it some time," Megumi said.<p>"Hey, Bell, what did you mean when you said you knew Ranma?" Keiichi asked.<p>"Oh, well, I'll have to check when we get home, but, a few years ago one of my... cousins was... defeated by a Japanese boy named Ranma Saotome, I suppose you could say. It happened in China. My cousin was quite a formidible warrior, so we were all rather shocked to hear he was defeated by a mere boy."<p>"Bell, when you say 'defeated', what do you mean?" Megumi asked.<p>Belldandy paused for a moment, and a worried frown appeared on her face for a brief second. "I mean he was almost destroyed. He's alive, though."<p>Keiichi was looking thoroughly shocked at the answer.<p>"Well, I suppose that kind of thing can happen in martial arts fights," Megumi said. Still, it made her nervous to think that Ranma, one of her friends, had nearly killed someone. She wondered if he had ever actually taken a life. Or if he had ever intended to do so.<p>She wasn't sure if she wanted to know the answer.<p>But later. Definitely later. Right now, she had an airplane flight to go watch. It would give her a chance to get a better grip on reality, at least. Then again, the way strange things tended to happen around her brother, maybe not.<p>-<p>Ranma was immensly pleased with his performance. The number of dropped jaw was a testiment to his showmanship. And there were few things Ranma Saotome enjoyed more than showing off his Art.<p>Tetsuo and the rest of the kempo club had their hands full for the moment, with all the new member sign-ups. It was time to exit stage right before someone got the bright idea of pressing him into service signing up new members.<p>Drawing a few more amazed gasps from the crowd, Ranma lept back up onto the fence and ran towards the engineering building. Megumi and Keiichi had come to watch his performance; now it was time to go watch theirs.<p>===========
