</div>                Chapter 3<p>Ranma  ½: Old Friends</p><p>Chapter  3</p>***************<p>By the way, in this story, the Moko Takabisha Ranma  learned on his own and he is the only person in the world who can do it. You  will see why later. Now, on with the story.</p><p>"Ryoga?"  Ranma said as he stood up. The motion attracted the attention of the eternally  lost-boy, who was looking around, trying to find someone who could give him  directions.</p><p>The  girls looked at the two in surprise for a moment before Ryoga wondered over  towards their table, almost getting lost on the way. Stopping in front of the  table, Ryoga looked at Ranma for a long moment before asking, "How do you know  my name?"</p><p>"P-chan,  don't you recognize me? It's me, Ranma!" he said, surprised. After all, they had  known each other ever since they were kids.</p><p>"Don't  call me P-chan!" Ryoga yelled and punched at the pigtailed youth in front of  him. Unprepared for an attack, Ranma didn't block fast enough and ended up  sprawled on the floor after he flew backwards over the back of the booth.</p><p>"Ranma!"  the girls yelled together as they rushed to put themselves in between him and  the confused youth who looked like he was trying to wake himself up from a  dream.</p><p>"Ranma?  But he's crippled!" Ryoga said as he stared at the thin figure on the floor in  shock.</p><p>"He  is not crippled!" Serena shouted as she glared up at him, her blue eyes glued  to his green ones.</p><p>"Serena,  it's ok. I am crippled to a certain extent." Ranma said as Serena and Mina  slowly helped him to his feet.</p><p>"But  you're getting better, Ranma."</p><p>"I  know, but I don't think I'll be up to taking on Ryoga here for a while." He  said as he sat back down. Looking up at the still shocked Ryoga, he smiled  bitterly and asked, "So how are the others?"</p><p>"Others?  They're fine." Ryoga said as he sat down across from Ranma. "But, why ask me?  You probably see and talk to them more than I do." Ryoga hadn't seen Ranma  since he had visited him at the hospital, so he didn't know that they had never  visited him except for Kasumi.</p><p>"I  haven't seen any of them since around the time I last saw you, except for  Kasumi every once in a while." Ranma said softly and stared down at the  table.</p><p>"What?  I can't believe that Akane or anyone else wouldn't visit you!" Ryoga  exclaimed.</p><p>"I  guess you didn't hear then. The Tendos broke off the engagement because I  couldn't run the dojo for them, Ukyo said it was just to painful to see me in  the hospital so she just left, the amazons decided that I was no longer worthy  to be Shampoos husband and the  Kunos  stopped by once to tell me that I was no long worthy of being their opponent or  the future husband." Ranma said in an empty voice.</p><p>Ryoga  just stared at him for a moment in shock. He just couldn't believe that all the  people who had been so after Ranma to either marry him or kill him would just  leave him like that. Thinking along those lines reminded him of something that  he had been regretting ever since he had done it.</p><p>"Ranma,  I want to apologize for the things I said the last time I saw you. I let my  hatred for you block the fact that you have been my best friend ever since we  used to fight in elementary school, and I didn't mean it when I said that you  had deserved what happened to you." He said hesitantly as he looked down  at the table. He had had a lot of time to think since he had last seen Ranma  and he had a new outlook at things…</p><p>"It's  ok Ryoga. You just got caught up in the moment and then got lost before you  could do anything about it." Ranma said with a gentle smile at the lost  boy as he looked up, which Ryoga reflected after a moment.</p><p>The  peace was shattered a moment later when Mina said, "So guys, either of you  looking for a girlfriend right now?"</p><p>Everyone  stared at her for a second before Ranma calmly and deliberately started banging  his head on the table.</p><p>"Um,  I got one all ready." Ryoga said with a heavy blush.</p><p>"I  don't want one." Ranma said, not pausing in his banging.</p><p>"Mina!  After you heard all of what happened to him, you ask if Ranma wants a  girlfriend?" Serena said as she stared at her blond friend before turning  to Ranma and snapping, "Stop that Ranma. It's not going to do anything but  give you a headache."</p><p>"Ow."  Ranma moaned as he left his head on the table. "So how is Akane. I assume  that was who you meant?"</p><p>"Umm,  no. I meant Akari. I founder her not to long after I saw you last time and  realized that I loved her more than I ever did Akane." Ryoga said, his  face red in embarrassment.</p><p>"I  was wondering when you would figure out that you were meant for her."  Ranma said as he lifted his head and smiled at him.</p><p>"So  Ranma, I thought you couldn't walk without your braces." Ryoga said and Serena  smiled brightly at him.</p><p>Before  Ranma could say anything, she said, "I'm helping him with that. Soon he will be  as good as new!"</p><p>Ryoga  raised an eyebrow at her as the others suddenly started banging their heads on  the table or staring at her in shock. "What?" he asked calmly and Serena's face  paled as she realized what she had said.</p><p>"Nothing!"  she said nervously as she glanced around quickly to see if anyone had heard her  besides the ones at the table. Luckily, there was no one near their table so  only Ryoga had heard his slip. "I mean that I was helping him with some things  last night with his legs and now he can walk! Hee hee…" she said with a small  sweat drop as Ranma, Ray, and Mina all started banging their heads even harder.</p><p>"Right,  you expect me to believe that you helped him with physical therapy one night  only and suddenly he can walk just fine? I may not have been to school since junior  high school, but I'm not completely stupid." Ryoga said as he leaned back in  the booth.</p><p>"He  is right, ya know. We went to school together back then and when he managed to  get to school he had some of the highest scores in our grade. Back then, we were  pretty close in strength though I always managed to get the last bread of the  day, but it was fun competing like that against him when he wasn't trying to  kill me." Ranma said with a wistful smile as he held a hand to his aching head  while Ray and Mina slumped in their seats with their heads on the table,  groaning.</p><p>"Ranma…  do you think we can trust him with this?" Ami whispered but Ryoga's ears caught  it any way.</p><p>"Trust  me with what?</p><p>Ranma  gave a single sharp nod and leaned back, gesturing for Ami to tell him the  story about who they were and their powers.</p><p>Taking  a deep breath, Ami began to tell him about the Silver Millennium and who they  were back then. By the time she got to the part about Queen Beryl killing them  all, Ryoga held up a hand to stop her.</p><p>"During  one of my travels, I got to a Tibetan temple and I stayed there with them,  learning some meditation techniques. While I was there, they told me this story  about a kingdom on the moon that was destroyed and it's subjects who were sent  forward to earth. There were two representatives from each planet except earth  and the moon as the prince and the princess from those two were meant to be  together. Each planet had a girl who was close to the moon princess and they  each had a Knight to protect them but from what the monk said, there was hardly  enough energy to send them all forward, that the knights wouldn't awaken until  both the one they were to protect was in danger and in danger of their own  lives. I don't mean like the regular danger but a danger so great that they  were almost dead." Ryoga said, the longest explanation that Ranma could  remember giving since the time in the bathroom at the Tendo dojo when he  explained about how he got his curse.</p><p>"I don't remember anything  about the Knights. Maybe Luna and Artemis would know about them." Mina said and  Ryoga threw her a confused look.</p>"Luna and Artemis are the cats, right? So how can they talk?"<p>"They are lunar Cats. They have the power to speak because  of the crescent moons on their foreheads." Ami said as she studied him. "Do you  have any information on the Knights, Ryoga?"</p><p>"Some. One is supposed to be a strong fighter. Another is  supposed to be really smart. One is a sweet, caring, and usually happy guy. A  fourth one was very honorable. Fifth was into art. The sixth into racing. The  seventh was a stoic guy that never showed his emotions and the eighth one was a  very happy one who would fight if he had to, but also seemed to be surrounded  by death. He was always happy and loud while she was always quiet, shy and sad.  He was like the perfect counter balance for the scout of his planet. She was  the scout of death and rebirth I believe. Or was it death and destruction? I  can never remember which one it was. There was also mention of one more pair, but  they couldn't tell me anything about them." He said as he frowned thoughtfully  at the table.</p><p>"Wow.  So I guess that means that each of us had someone to love us back then and they  protected us, how romantic!" Mina said with stars in her eyes.</p><p>"I  guess, but don't forget, it may be years before you see them." Ranma warned  them quietly and they reluctantly nodded.</p><p>"I  wonder who the last pair is." Ami said thoughtfully.</p><p>"I  don't know, but I hope they show up soon. This new enemy seems to be stronger  than any of the others." Lita said and the other scouts nodded in agreement.  They finished their drinks and ice cream in silence.</p><p>Rei  still had some chores to do but didn't really what to be alone so invited the  others over while she did them, to just hang out.</p><p>"Sure!  You have that new manga, right Rei? You know the one that just came out two  days ago?" Serena said excitedly and Rei sighed before nodding. As they started  to head out the door, Serena suddenly stopped and turned to Ranma. "Ranma, what  should we do with the chair? And what are we going to tell my parents when we  get home? I mean, you left in the chair, barely able to walk on your own  without stumbling, but now, you can walk almost as well as you could before."</p><p>The  other girls stared at her in shock. For once, she had considered all the  possibilities before they even accrued to Ami, the brain of the group.</p><p>"I  figure that we could always just drag it with us to the shrine and call for  your dad to give us a ride home, thereby avoiding the whole thing for a while.  We can't exactly tell them that you're the Moon Princess and you used magic to  heal me." Ranma said logically and it was Ryoga's turn to stare at him. Seeing  the stare, Ranma snapped, "What?"</p><p>"You  actually thought something all the way out." Ryoga said dumbly and Ranma just  glared at him before turning and leaving with the girls who had gotten over  their own shock by this time. "Hey, wait up!" Ryoga said and hurried after them  with the wheel chair.</p><p>By  the time they reached the temple, Ranma was panting with exhaustion to the  surprise of almost all present. The only ones not surprised were Serena and  Lita. Ryoga ended up carrying him to the top on his back with the girls  bringing the chair. At the top he said quietly, "I'm sorry guys, but I haven't  used most of these muscles for almost a year."</p><p>"It's  ok Ranma, we know it's not your fault." Serena said as they rested at the top  of the stairs before moving on to Rei's room where they all sat around the  small table the girls used to study when they came over for a study group.</p><p>"Who  did this to you?" Mina said as she twirled a piece of her long hair around her  finger.</p><p>"Yeah,  you wouldn't tell us afterwards at the hospital." Ryoga said when Ranma was  quiet after Mina's question. The others started to prompt him except for Ami  who was saying, "We shouldn't pry." and Serena who already knew what had  happened.</p><p>"Fine,  fine,  what happened was, Kodachi, Ukyo,  and Shampoo all showed up at the dojo. They saw me before I could get away and  they started fighting and I ended up in the middle of it somehow. I never did  figure out why that was." He said the last part more to himself than the  others, but then continued. "Akane came home and went ballistic again and  slammed us all. Kodachi ended up in the tree, Ukyo was smashed into the ground  and Shampoo and I were smashed into the wall. She called Kodachi's house and  the Cat Café to come get Kodachi and Shampoo and lugged Ukyo back to her  restaurant, leaving me in the wall, or at least, I think that was what happened  to the other girls, because all four of them were gone by the time Kasumi found  me. Now can we drop it?" He said and got up from the table to look out the  window at the other side of the room.</p><p>"Akane  did this to him?" Ryoga said shocked and Serena nodded somberly. "He told my  parents the whole story when he called to see if he could live with us for a  while."</p><p>"Last  night, before he left the park, he said he was like this because a tomboy  couldn't learn to control her temper." Lita said, just as shocked as Ryoga.</p><p>"But  why would she do something like that? It wasn't his fault that they were  fighting over him." Mina said angrily.</p><p>"Remember  he said that she always thought it was his fault." Ami said as she recalled  what he had said in the arcade.</p><p>"Now  that I think about it, she was always blaming him for our fights, even when I  attacked him." Ryoga said and looked over at the thin, pigtailed teenager over  at the window with something akin to regret in his eyes. Quietly, he stood up  and approached him., stopping just behind Ranma, who turned around to face him.</p><p>"Ranma,  would you like to spar with me sometime? You know, build yourself back up now  that you're basically healed."</p><p>"Sure.  You were always the best one to fight with because you were the only one who  was a challenge for a long time." Ranma said as he nodded. "Maybe you could  stay at my Aunt and Uncle's house with me for a while. I hope it'll be ok."  Ranma said as they both headed back to the table to join the others as Rei left  to finish her chores. Just before she left the room, Ranma jumped to his feet  and said, "Rei, could I help you with your chores? It would help me get back  into shape."</p><p>"Are  you sure?" she asked and at his nod, she pulled out a broom and handed it to  him. "In that case, you can sweep the leaves in the yard into a pile to be  burned. That shouldn't be to hard, right?" she said with a smile as she pulled  out a bucket and a rag to wash the floors.</p><p>The  girls sat outside on the veranda talking and watched as Ranma swept the yard,  while Ryoga started to do some katas off to the side to pass the time. Rei  joined Ranma about half an hour later after she had finished her other chores  and they finished the yard quickly.</p><p>As  Rei put the brooms on the veranda, Ranma and Ryoga began a gentle spar, but  before they got to far into it, a group of four girls arrived at the temple.</p><p>"Sestuna!  Hotaru! Guys! What are you doing here?" Serena said excitedly as she charged up  to the small group and gave them each a hug.</p><p>"We  came to talk to you five." Haruka said as she pointedly looked at Ranma and  Ryoga who were approaching with the other girls.</p><p>"Oh,  don't worry about the guys, they all ready know about us." Serena said and the  four outer scouts tensed up.</p><p>"You  told outsiders about us?" Haruka exclaimed and Michiru looked shocked.</p><p>"Ryoga  already knew and Ranma found out after I transformed in my room and he saw me  leave." Serena said.</p><p>"Well,  you can erase their memories. It is dangerous for strangers to know about us."  Michiru said as she looked over at the boys again. Suddenly she gasped loudly  as she got a good look at Ryoga.</p><p>As  the others looked at her in surprise, she ran up to him and threw her arms  around him and pulled him into a tight hug. "Oh my God, Ryoga! It's been such a  long time, I thought I would never see you again." She said against his neck as  he hesitantly wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>"Michiru?  Is it you?" he asked and at her nodded, he let out a whoop and swung her around  in a circle. After a minute, he put her down and gave her another hug before  releasing her to look her over before pulling her back into his arms for yet  another hug.</p><p>"Michiru?  You know this guy?" Haruka asked stunned.</p><p>"Haruka!  I want you to meet my cousin Ryoga Hibiki. I haven't seen his since he disappeared  when he was 12. His side of the family has the worst sense of direction anyone  has ever seen." She explained and Ranma piped up from behind them.</p><p>"I  remember you Michiru. You used to walk him to school every day."</p><p>"Yes,  but who are you?"</p><p>"Ranma  Saot…um, just Ranma." He said, catching himself before he could say his last  name.</p><p>"Ranma?  Oh I remember you. You were always getting the last bread of the day before  Ryoga, right? He was always complaining about it."</p><p>"Yeah,  we've had out differences, but we're actually pretty good friends."</p><p>Haruka  had been listening to all of this in silence but now a frown spread across her  face. "Ranma, what happened to you? I've never seen you look so bad before."  She said suddenly and everyone stopped what they were doing to stare at her.</p><p>"What  do you mean, Haruka?" Michiru asked confused.</p><p>"We  were in school together when I was in eight grade. We were always competing  against each other which he would always win unless it was a race." Haruka said  and she saw recognition spread across Ranma's face.</p><p>"I  don't believe this. How have you been Haruka-chan?" Ranma said with a slow grin  crossing his face.</p><p>"Don't  call me Haruka-chan, Ran-chan." She snapped and Ranma's face lost it's grin  suddenly, and he turned away and picked up his discarded broom and started  sweeping the clean ground.</p><p>"Don't  call him Ran-chan. It probably reminds him of Ukyo." Ryoga whispered harshly to  Haruka while Serena hurried over to talk to Ranma. Everyone stared at the two  as Serena put a hand on Ranma's shoulder,   talking softly to his, but Ranma just shrugged her hand off and headed  for the trees that surrounded the temple, tossing the broom at Rei as he passed  her.</p><p>As  he dissappered, Haruka finally turned to Ryoga who was still glaring at her and  asked, "What the hell happened to him? He's not the same Ranma I remember."</p><p>"If  you'd been through what he's been through the last four years, you would  understand." Turning to Serena, he asked he to explain and then hurried after  Ranma.</p><p>"…and  now he's staying at my house for now so that he can get out on his own." Serena  finished and the outer scouts stared at her in shock.</p><p>"That  poor young man." Sestuna sighed as she shook her head. Hatoru and Michiru were  almost in tears and Haruka was ready to kill Genma and the Tendos.</p><p>"Ryoga  is going to help him get back into shape, but even in the bad shape he's in  right now, he still help out in the fight last night." Mina said, and the other  inner scouts nodded.</p><p>"How?"  Sestuna asked.</p><p>"He  threw a blue energy ball at Ebonite, stopping an attack that was coming at me."  Serena said and Sestuna looked at her sharply.</p><p>"Do  you know what this attack was called?"</p><p>"No,  it just came out of nowhere. Why?"</p><p>"From the way you descaribed it, it sounded like it was a  Moko Takabisha." Sestuna said and from behind her Ranma suddenly said, "It  was."</p><p>Spinning  around, the scout of Pluto stared at him in something akin to horror. "Only one  person in all of history has been able to learn Moko Takabisha and he's been dead  for a thousand years."</p><p>"And  who was that?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Jupiter  Knight. How the hell did you learn that move?" she demanded and everyone stared  at her because it was a well know fact that she didn't swear.</p><p>"I  don't know, I just picked it up one day." He said as he watched her warily.  Before anyone could say anything, five teenage boys arrived at the top of the  steps.</p><p>They  would have gone unnoticed because of the confirntation between Ranma and  Sestuna, but one of them a boy with knee length brown hair pulled back into a  braid was singing extremlly loud in English with a another boy, this one  Chinese, yelling at him to shut up.</p><p>Rei  immedtaly stepped forward and put herself in between the two boys, surprising  all five of them. "Please, both of you be quiet on temple grounds." She  snapped.</p><p>"Do  not tell me what to do, onna." The Chinese boy said sharply before turning back  to the boy with the braid.</p><p>Stunned  and angry at the tone he had addressed her in, she spun him around and slapped  him. Everyone present, including the other four guys, stared at her like she  had two heads. "You shouldn't have done that, lady. Wufei doesn't seem to like  women to much." The braided boy said as he grabbed one of Wufei's arms with the  small blonde grabbing the other one as Wufei started towards her.</p><p>"Let  go of me Maxwell, Winner, or you will lose the use of your arms very shortly."  Wufei growled and wrenched his arm free from the blonde and punched the braided  one in the face. Before he could reach Rei, who had backed up a couple feet,  Ranma and Ryoga stepped in front of him each glowing with ki.</p><p>"I wouldn't do that if I were you." Ranma said as he  prepared a Moko Takabisha in his hands.   Seeing the ki ball, Wufei froze and started to back away.</p><p>"You  can control your ki?" he asked warily and both Ranma and Ryoga nodded once,  firmly. "Then I apologise for intending to strike your woman." He said with a  quick bow before putting more space between them.</p><p>"She  isn't our woman but she is a friend." Ranma said as he disperced the ki ball.</p><p>"What's  ki?"  this came from the braided one and  Wufei snapped absently, "It is the energy inside a living thing, but only a  skilled martial artist or a monk could hope to tap into it. Those two have to  be masters to manifest that large of a battle aura and the attacks, Maxwell."</p><p>"Can't  you ever just call me Duo?" Maxwell sighed before turning back to the other,  larger group. "Hi! I'm Duo Maxwell. We heard that there was a person who worked  at this temple who could do fire readings."</p><p>"Hi  Duo. My name is Rei and I'm the Priestess here, and yes I can do fire readings.  Why did you seek me out?" Rei asked.</p><p>"Well,  you see, I can't remember anything before I was five, not even my real name and  I was wondering if you could use the fire reading to help me." Duo said,  completely serious.</p><p>"Ok,  follow me and I will consult with the scared fire." She said and started off  towards the temple.</p><p>"Wait!  Can we watch?" Serena called and Rei shook her head.</p><p>"Serena  you know better than to ask me to let you watch a personal fire reading for  someone else." She scolded then lead Duo away, leaving the two groups alone.</p><p>As  soon as she was settled in front of the fire with Duo kneeling behind her, she  knew that something was going to happen and it would not be good.</p><p>Thank  you for waiting so patiatly for this next chapter. I'm sorry for taking so  long, but I've been busy in school and I stll am. It will be a while before I  get anything else out except maybe for Ranmaeva. I almost have the next chapter  done. I need everyone's help to pick a new name for this story. It's now going  to have Gundam Wing in it so I can't really call it Ranma Moon any more. Any  ideas? Review and put your ideas in. Thanks.</p><p>Shinigami-chan</p>
