</div>                Ranma ½: Old and New Friends<p>I seem to have  forgotten to put in how old everyone is. The inner scouts and the Gundam pilots  are all 16. Hotaru is 13, Haruka and Michiru are 18, Sestuna is 20 and Ranma is   is 20 and Zechs and Treize are 20 and 21, respectively. At least they  will be when they get there, since I'm sure most of you have realized who they  will be in my story. Also, I will be referring to the Knights as with their  name and a K after it like Pluto Knight would be, Pluto K. this way I don't  confuse everyone when both Sailor and Knight from a planet are fighting  together. Anyway, here is the next chapter in Gundam Moon 1/2</p><p>Ranma ½: Old and New  Friends</p><p>Chibi Moon Brings  Friends from the Future</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Sailor Pluto and  Pluto Knight appeared at the time gate and Trowa lost his transformation as he  collapsed at the ground, almost taking Sestuna with him.</p><p>"Trowa, are you all  right?" she asked as she knelt next to him, but he didn't hear her as he was  already unconscious. "I guess I'll just have to wait for you to wake up before  I thank you for saving my life." She murmured as she picked him up and brought  him to the small house near the Time Gate to rest.</p><p>Ukyo woke up to  bright sunlight streaming in through her open window and a bird sing just  outside in a near by tree. 'Today I will go after my Ran-chan.' She though  happily as she got dressed and stuffed some things in her travel packs.</p><p>Ten minutes later,  she was locking the front door to her restaurant, which had a sign on the door  saying that if would be closed for a few weeks. After double-checking the  locks, she hurried towards the Tendo dojo, happy thoughts circling her mind.</p><p>'By now, he should be  almost be as good as new again and then we can get married and run the Ucchan  together and have a ton of kids. After all, I'm the cute fiancée and he loves  me.' She thought happily to herself.</p><p>Arriving at the dojo,  she knocked on the door and waited as someone hurried to open it. She took a  step back when Akane opened the door.</p><p>"What do you want?"  Akane snapped as she saw who was waiting at the door.</p><p>"I came by to talk to  Kasumi." Ukyo said stiffly. She had never liked Akane and after what she and  her family had done to Ranma, Akane had dropped off the very bottom of Ukyo's  list of people she liked and on to the very top of her list of people she  hated.</p><p>"What do you want  with my sister?" Akane growled at the chef.</p><p>"That is between me  and her so get out of my face and tell her that I'm here to talk." Ukyo snapped  angrily. Before Akane could say anything else, Kasumi stepped up behind her and  gently pushed her back into the house.</p><p>"Akane, would you go  get me the mop from the hall closet? I spilled some soup on the floor of the  kitchen." She said and Akane nodded reluctantly before casting on last glare at  Ukyo then turned and went into the house.</p><p>"Kasumi, I just came  by to ask for Ranma's new address." Ukyo said as the older girl turned back to  her.</p><p>"Wait just a moment  and I'll write it down for you." Kasumi said as she went back into the house  for a minute. She was back a moment later with a small piece of paper. "Here  you go, Ukyo. God luck and tell Ranma hello for me, ok?"</p><p>"Ok Kasumi. Thank  you." Ukyo said as she turned and left. 'Soon my darling Ranchan will be  together and no one is going to get between us ever again.'</p><p>At noon, Ranma,  Ryoga, Hotaru, Serena, and Lita, with Duo and the other pilots, except Trowa  who was still gone, tagging along, met at the lake. "Ok, first we are going to  start with a gentle jog around the lake. Later, Ryoga and I will show you guys,  um and girls some katas that will be easier for some of you to learn. Since  Lita and Wufei have already had some training, Ryoga will show them harder ones  will the re4st of us continue the others. I would do it because I know more  advanced ones from my family's…er ex-family's style, but I can't really perform  them right now." Ranma said and turned towards Ryoga's pack on the ground  nearby and started pulling out weights to put on everyone's ankles.</p><p>Everyone except  Hotaru, who got one pound weights, got two pounds weights. Ryoga and Ranma also  didn't get weights. They carried heavy packs instead. As they started on their  jog, Ryoga lead with Lita, Heero and Wufei right behind him and Quatre and  Serena right behind them. Ranma and Duo ran on either of Hotaru at the back of  the group to make sure she would be able to do it and to make sure she knew  that she was welcome there.</p><p>"So Hotaru, how old  are you? In my memories, you were as old as I was, but now, you seem a little  younger." Duo said quietly.</p><p>"I would have been  16, but about a year ago, I has taken over by Mistress 9. Later, when I became  Sailor Saturn, I defeated her master Pharaoh 90, but I used up most of my  energy and was transformed into a baby. When I was needed again, I started to  age, but I stopped aging when I hit 13." Hotaru said, and then got a horrified  look on her face. "My age isn't going to be a problem. Is it?"</p><p>"It's only three  years difference. Darien is four years older than Serena and from what she's  told me, they get married and rule some place called Crystal Tokyo together."  Ranma said reassuringly.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yeah! You're my  little Firefly and nothing is going to change that." Duo said as he grabbed her  hand and kissed it quickly. They continued jogging in silence the rest of the  way, but by the end, Hotaru and Ranma were gasping for breath.</p><p>As they caught their  breath, Ryoga took off his pack and said, "Everyone can take off their weights  now. As soon as everyone catches their breath, we'll start on a basic kata. For  everyone who already knows some katas, you can come with me. We'll be going  over there to do some more complicated ones."</p><p>Within ten minutes,  Ranma was leading Duo, Hotaru, Serena, Quatre, and Heero through the moves,  stopping every once in a while to correct one or another who were following  him. Twenty feet away, Ryoga was leading Wufei and Lita through  the moves of an intermediate kata that both  of them took to with little difficulties.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the  Time Gates, Sestuna was watching Trowa as he slept. "I wish you would wake up."  She whispered as she sipped her tea. As she sat there, she called up a viewing  screen and started to watch her life during the Silver Millennium. The first  thing she saw was her first meeting with the Pluto Knight….</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Your Majesties, the  Pluto Knight and a young man are here to see you." A butler announced as he  lead a tall man and a boy into the throne room in the Royal Palace on Pluto.</p><p>The tall man was  dressed in a gray uniform with a black cape with the inside maroon tossed over  his shoulders and a maroon mask over his eyes. His brown hair was cut short in  pack and his bangs were long. They stuck straight out in front of him, covering  one eye.</p><p>The boy was about  fourteen, the same age as the Princess and looked similar to the older man with  his emerald eyes and the brown hair that covered one brilliant orb. He was  wearing tight black pants with a blue turtleneck.</p><p>"My dear Knight. It  is wonderful to see you again. Is it time already?" the Queen said as she  dismissed her servants and guards then approached and hugged the older man.</p><p>"It is good to see  you too, your Majesty and yes it is time." Pluto knight said with a twinkle in  his eyes. "Where is your husband?"</p><p>"He's in a meeting  with his advisers. So, is this him?" she asked as she looked over at the boy.</p><p>"Yes, his name is  Triton." Pluto K. said as he too turned to the boy.</p><p>"It is an honor to  meet you." Triton said as he bowed to the Queen, then turned to the Princess,  who was standing behind her mother. It is also an honor to meet you, Princess."</p><p>"Triton, this is  Princess Sestuna. You will be in charge of protecting her as Pluto Knight." The  Queen said as Pluto K. took out a maroon disk with a key in the center. As he  handed it to his son, his uniform flickered and disappeared, leaving in its  place a pair of black pants with a dark blue t-shirt.</p><p>"Do you accept this  honor?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The Queen turned too  her daughter at the same time and handed her a transformation pen. "Sestuna,  this is your wand to transform into Sailor Pluto. Just say Pluto Planet Power  and you will transform into Sailor Pluto. You will be trained later to take  over the Time Gates when I have more time." The queen said and Sestuna nodded  as she held up the wand. Within moments, both Triton and Sestuna were  transformed. Triton looked just like his father had only a few minutes before  with the uniform and maroon mask and cape.</p><p>Sestuna was now  wearing a white body suit with a black sailor collar, skirt, and choker with  black material at the top of her elbow length gloves. She had two maroon bows  with the one on her chest having a red disk in the center. On her feet was a  pair of black boots that reached to her knees with a small white stripe along  the top edge.</p><p>"Congratulations, you  two. Now, you need to train in your basic powers and to do that you will need  your weapons. For Sailor Pluto it is the Time Staff." The queen said as she  transformed into Eternal Sailor Pluto. Her outfit was the same as her  daughter's except the skirt had three layers, black, maroon, and a white layer  between them. Her poof sleeves were maroon and her bows were more angular and  had a heart shaped center. Her back bow also had two long streamers coming from  it that reached to her ankles. Her boots were also different in the aspect that  they had spiked heels, where Sestuna's had only half-inch heels. In her hands  appeared a tall key shaped staff that had a grant orb at the top.</p><p>Handing the staff to  her daughter, she smiled and said, "This Time key will allow you to do your  attack Dead Scream, and it will allow you to control the Time Gates. With it,  you can also make small key's so that a chosen person can use it to travel in  time with out you."</p><p>Turning to Pluto  Knight, she picked up a sword from beside the throne, and presented it to him.  "Pluto Knight. This is the Time Sword. With this, you too can control the time  gates and do magical attacks. Your father will have to instruct you in those,  though, as I have no clue about them." She said and he nodded.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"My real name is  Triton?" Trowa asked from behind Pluto. Spinning around, she saw him sitting up  in the bed, watching over her shoulder. With a wave of her hand, she made the  viewer disappear before answering his question.</p><p>"Yes. Didn't you know  that?"</p><p>"No. I was raised by  a group of mercenaries that called me Nanashi my entire life." He said quietly.  Catching the question in her eyes, he said, "Nanashi means No Name. I later  took the code name Trowa Barton  I was  sent to earth as a Gundam pilot."</p><p>"Would you prefer to  be called Trowa or Triton?" she asked and he was quiet a moment before saying,  "You can call me either of them. It doesn't really matter."</p><p>Before she could say  anything about that, two things happened. The first was she heard the sound of  the time gates as they let some one through. The second one was Trowa started  to glow again and suddenly, he was the same age as she was.</p><p>As she was starring  at him, someone knocked on the door to the little house and opened it before  Sestuna could gather her wits. "Puu, I hope you don't mind, but mama sent us  back to train and she said to…oh my god! I'm so sorry!" Rini exclaimed as she  ducked out of the door and slammed it behind her.</p><p>The sound of the door  slamming was enough to knock her out of her shock. Quickly, she stood up and  hurried to the door with Trowa a step behind. Outside, they found Rini and five  boys waiting for them with the boys surrounding Rini in an attempt to protect  her. Rini herself was still blushing as she stared at the ground.</p><p>"Small Lady, what is  this about?" Sailor Pluto said as she grasped her key tightly.</p><p>"Um, mom sent us back  to train with the scouts and the knights. I'm so sorry Puu! I didn't men to  interrupt you and Trowa."</p><p>"How did you know my  name?" Trowa said as he slid into a defensive stance.</p><p>"You married Puu  before I was born and…" Rini started but one of the boys spoke up before she  could finish.</p><p>"She knows your name  because you are my father." He said and Trowa turned to him in shock. The boy  was a 12 years old kid with forest green hair that was cut short in back and  long in front so that it hung over one light brown eye. He was wearing tight  blue jeans and a black turtleneck with brown boots. Trowa didn't have any  pictures of when her was that age, but he knew that if the kid had brown hair  and green eyes instead of the other way around and if the turtleneck were a  dark blue instead of black, they would have looked identical. So Trowa did the  only think his over taxed mind could think of. He fainted.</p><p>"Trowa!" Pluto and  Rini yelled as they rushed to catch him.</p><p>"What's wrong with  him?" one of the other boys asked as the younger Trowa look alike moved forward  to help. He, too, looked like he was twelve and he had long black hair that was  pulled back into a braid and purple eyes. He was wearing tight back jeans with  a baggy black t-shirt and black boots.</p><p>"He just met a son he  hasn't had yet. What do you think is the problem?" another boy snapped. Like  all the other boys, he was twelve also with short messy brown hair and deep  blue eyes. He had black jeans, blue sneakers, and a blue tank top that showed  off his well-defined muscles. The expression on his face, though made the other  boy gulp and back away nervously.</p><p>"Both of you be  quiet. Trowa is starting to wake-up." another boy, this one blond with light  blue eyes said and the others nodded. This short boy wearing black jeans with a  yellow t-shirt and brown boots was the leader of the group and the others  looked to him for direction.</p><p>The five boys watched  in silence as Trowa opened his eyes and climbed to his feet warily. He opened  his mouth to say something, but before he could, a viewing portal popped into  existence in front of the group.</p><p>Sailor Pluto  immediately turned to it and studied the images being showed. It was a view of  the park near the lake and it showed Sailors Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn dodging  pieces of fruit that exploded as soon as it touched something. Ryoga, Jupiter,  Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Venus Knights were dodging and attacking Ebonite,  keeping him busy so that he could not disappear.</p><p>Suddenly, Jupiter K.  went down hard as he was blasted in the stomach by a black ball of energy.  Normally he could have taken it and kept on fighting, but because of his  weakened state, it knocked him out of the fight. Ryoga charged at Ebonite and  was taken out of the fight with a point black energy blast to his face. Pluto  winced as he lay on the ground screaming in pain, his eyes reduced to empty  sockets.</p><p>Quickly, she looked  at the possible future if someone didn't help them soon and blanched as she saw  all the scouts and Knights killed in bloody, violent ways, after which, the  world was completely destroyed as Ebonite and a shadowed figure behind him,  took over and wiped everything out, leaving the earth as a dead and lifeless,  ball floating in space.</p><p>"I can not allow this  to happen!" she said in a deadly voice. Waving her key, the view portal disappeared.  Slamming the but of her staff on the floor, a gate opened and she headed  towards it.</p><p>"I'm coming too."  Trowa said as he grabbed his transformation disk out of thin air. In the space  of a few seconds, Pluto Knight stood next to Sailor Pluto.</p><p>"Don't forget about  us." Rini said as she pulled out her compact. The boys nodded as they also  pulled out small disks. "Moon Prism Power!" she yelled and immediately she was  transformed into Sailor Chibi-Moon. Without saying anything, the boys also  transformed into chibi versions of Mars, Pluto, Saturn, Mercury, and Venus  Knights.</p><p>"…" Wordlessly, Pluto  and Pluto K. turned and disappeared through the doorway with the others  following right behind them.</p><p>Sailor Moon was  getting really worried. The attack had come just after they had finished  working out. A banana had fallen just in front of them and they had watched,  stunned as it exploded. Everyone who could, had transformed as fast as they  could, only to be attacked by a monster that looked like a banana it's self.  Ebonite had arrived at the same time and the guys had gone to fight him,  leaving the girls to fight the creature after sailor Jupiter had yelled at them  to just get out of her way.</p><p>Now, with Ranma and  Ryoga injured and out of the fight, and Hotaru feeling tired from the endless  jumping about as she dodged the attacks, and Lita not being about to land a  decent hit, things were looking grim. Hearing another scream of pain, she  risked a glance over her shoulder just in time to see Quatre collapse, blood  dripping down the side of his face from a large cut at his hairline from where  Ebonite had slammed him with his fist. The cut must have come from the ring on  his finger and it was not as bad as it seemed with all the blood.</p><p>'Please, someone help  us.' Serena thought desperately to herself. As is in answer to her thoughts,  Pluto arrived with a whole bunch of people that she hadn't expected. Chibi-moon  was there, surrounded by what appeared to be smaller versions of the knights  fighting Ebonite at the moments. And next to Sestuna was another Knight, who  she was guessing to be Pluto Knight.</p><p>"Dead Scream." "Dead  Shout!" Pluto and Pluto K. said together. As the two balls of maroon energy hit  the monster, it exploded, destroying everything in a ten-foot radius. All  activities sensed as everyone turned to stare at the two responsible as they  slowly advanced side by side.</p><p>"We will not allow  you to destroy this world. You and your leader will never succeed." Pluto and  Pluto K. said together, as if they had practiced what they were going to say  before hand.</p><p>"My Queen sends her  regards. Now things are getting to boring. Good-bye." Ebonite said and  disappeared.</p><p>There was a complete  silence for a moment before Chibi-Moon turned to Sailor Moon and rushed to give  her a hug. "Sailor Moon! Mommy sent us back to train again. Isn't it great?"  she said as she let her go to look up at the shocked face above her.</p><p>"What? US?" Serena  exclaimed as she stared down at the pink haired girl. She was older now, about  twelve and her hair was starting to lose the big poofs that usually puffed out.  Now they were starting to get longer and thinner as they hung down to her  elbows..</p><p>"Yeah. Mom sent back  with me half of my guard. The others will be coming later. They're younger then  the others, so mom and the other scouts wanted to train them a little bit  more." Rini said as she turned and motioned for the Chibi-Knights to come  forward.</p><p>"Sailor Moon, these  are Chibi- Venus Knight, Chibi-Mercury Knight, Chibi- Mars Knight, Chibi-  Saturn Knight, and Chibi-Pluto Knight. Or Tai, Odin, Matt, Duo Jr., and Triton,  in that order." She said and they bowed as their names were called.</p><p>The one named Duo  Jr., however, started grumbling to himself as he glared at the little girl.  Catching his glare, Chibi-Moon grinned and said, "Don't call Duo Jr. that. He  hates that name and prefers to be called Shin."</p><p>"Shin? As in  Shinigami?" Duo said from behind the group of boys. He and the other Knights  had already detransformed as the two Moons had been talking and Ranma had woken  up as well, but he was sitting next to Ryoga as the lost boy put one of his  many bandanas over his bloody sockets.</p><p>"That's right. Who's  asking?" Shin demanded as he turned around.</p><p>"Shinigami." Duo  snapped angry that some one had stole his name and his Knight position. Then he  got a good look at the boy and almost had a heart attack. "Wha...what…what the  HELL?" he screamed as he turned white as a sheet. If it wasn't for the black  hair, the kid would look identical to him when he was that age, if just a  little bet better fed.</p><p>"Shinigami? Pop!"  Shin said as he lost all his hostility and a huge grin spread across his face,  a grin that the other Gundam Pilots knew very well, as they saw it every day on  the face of the manically cheerful Duo Maxwell.</p><p>"Pop?" they gasped  as they stared at the two of them. Duo didn't say anything, but he suddenly sat  down hard on the ground.</p><p>"I'm a dad? But I'm  to young to have a kid!" he said and Hotaru rushed up to him and dropped to her  knees next to him, wrapping her arms around his shoulders.</p><p>"Duo! Don't worry.  He's from the future. You haven't had any kids yet, unless you haven't told me  something?" she said as she drew back a little with a hurt look on her face.</p><p>"No! I never… I  haven't…" he stuttered with a blush on his face as he gathered her close again  and she smiled happily as she snuggled against his chest. Before they or Shin  or anyone else could say anything more, Ranma spoke up from his position next  to Ryoga, who was now leaning heavily against him.</p><p>"While this is  incredibly interesting, Ryoga needs some help here. That guy's attack destroyed  Ryoga's eyes and I don't know what to do."</p><p>"Oh my god, Ryoga!"  Hotaru said as she scrabbled out of Duo's arms to rush to Ryoga who turned  towards the sound of her voice. "Let me see." She demanded and Ryoga nodded as  he fumbled with the bandana. After a moment, she brushed his hands aside and  took it off herself. She gasped as she saw the ruin that used to be his face,  especially his eyes, before she gentle covered the empty sockets with her small  hands. Concentrating, her hands started to glow purple as she started to heal  the massive amounts of damage. When it appeared that she was starting to falter  as her energy started to wane, Duo put a hand on her shoulder and gave her some  of his energy as he had been taught to in the Silver Millennium. Casting him a  grateful smile, she went back to work. Just as Duo was starting to tire, she  removed her hands and stopped taking the energy she needed to work with from  Duo.</p><p>As they slumped  against each other tiredly, the others gathered around to see that Ryoga's eyes  were as good as new and the various cuts and scratches were also healed. The  only difference now, was Ryoga's green eyes now had purple flecks in the  irises.</p><p>During the time when  Hotaru had been healing Ryoga, the others had detransformed and the rest of the  Senshi and Darien had arrived. Now, Rini took off her backpack and started  rooting around inside. When Serena looked at her curiously, she said, "Mom sent  you a letter and some other stuff." She handed her the letter and kept looking  through the bag, pulling things out and putting them to the side.</p><p>Curious, Serena  opened the letter and started to read.</p><p>Dear Serena,</p><p>Thank you for all that you have done with Rini there in  the past. I have noticed that she is a lot more mature and is a capable  fighter. I want her to train some more with you so I sent her back. I also want  her protectors to train some too, so I have sent back the chibi Knights of Mercury,  Mars, Venus, Saturn and Pluto. The Chibi-knights from Jupiter, Uranus, and  Neptune will be along with the Chibi-scouts of some of the planets. There are  currently chibi-scouts from Pluto, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Venus. They  will be along later as the Chibi-scouts are only eight and the other scouts  want them to train a little bit more before they are sent back and the  chibi-knights are also twelve like the five we sent back. By the way, I loved  the presents you sent back with Rini last time, especially the cookies from her  grandmother. Please send more!</p><p>Love,</p><p>Neo-Queen  Serenity</p><p>P.S. I sent back more powerful transformation wands for  all the scouts. You will need them, but there are none for the Knights or for  Tuxedo Mask. Ja ne!</p><p>Serena sweat dropped  briefly then folded the letter and crammed it into the envelope before turning  to her future daughter. "She said you had new wands for us?" she said and Rini  nodded as she held out a heart shaped locket to her.</p><p>After Serena had  taken her new locket, Rini went to the other scouts and handed them their new  wands, too. Finally she said, "Mama said that the next time to need to  transform, Serena and I have to say Moon Crisis Power and the rest of you have  to say your planet Crystal Power. Like Puu would say, Pluto Crystal Power. She  said it was the next step in gaining your full powers. You only have one  transformation left after this new one."</p><p>"Thank you, Small  Lady." Sestuna said and handed her old wand to Rini who took it and went around  to the others to get theirs as well. When she got back to Serena, she stopped  her from handing the locket over. "Our lockets transfers our crystals to our  new ones when we say our transformation phrase, so don't worry about it." She  said importantly, then turned to Darien.</p><p>"Darien! Let's go get  some ice cream!" she exclaimed as she jumped into his arms and gave him a hug.</p><p>"Brat, get your hands  off my man!" Serena growled as she stalked towards the pair.</p><p>"Darien is mine,  Meatball head!" Rini shouted as she hugged him tighter.</p><p>"Flamingo head, let  go!" Rini jumped to the ground and the two of them got into a tug of war with  Darien being pulled in two directions by his arms while the others sweat  dropped and laughed, except for the Gundam pilots, Ranma and Ryoga, who didn't  know them well enough to be more than stunned.</p><p>While the girls were  still fighting over the embarrassed Darien, Duo turned to Trowa who was still  standing next to Sestuna. "Trowa, what happened to make you look older?" he  asked and all motion stopped as everyone blinked blinked at him and then turned  to the older Trowa, who blushed.</p>
