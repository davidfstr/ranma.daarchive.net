</div><p>Ranma ½: Death of Happiness</p><p>Tragedy</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Akari was tired. She had been traveling for a week,  looking for Ryoga,</p><p>whom she hadn't seen in over a month. Her first stop  in her attempt to</p><p>find her boyfriend, was a quick stop at the Tendo  dojo…</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Hello Akari. How may I help you?" Kasumi said  pleasantly as she</p><p>escorted the younger girl into the living room. No  one else was there at</p><p>the moment so Akari felt more at ease as they sat down  and sipped some</p><p>tea together.</p><p>"I'm looking for Ryoga, Kasumi, and I know that he  used to come here and</p><p>fight Ranma a lot. So I was wondering if you would  know, perhaps, which</p><p>direction he had been heading in the last time you  say him and when that</p><p>was." Akari said as she put her cup back on the  table.</p><p>"I understand." Kasumi said with a smile before she  continued. "He was</p><p>here about three weeks ago and he didn't stay for  very long. I believe</p><p>he finally figured out that he didn't love Akane as  much as he had</p><p>thought. I'm not sure where he was going, but he  headed towards Jubaan.</p><p>You might want to go to where Ranma will be staying  in a few weeks. It's</p><p>his aunt's house and they will be picking him up in  a week or two."</p><p>"But, why would I go to where Ranma is? It's Ryoga I  want." Akari said</p><p>confused.</p><p>"Because Ryoga some how always finds Ranma, no  matter where they go. He</p><p>may get lost on the way, but he always ends up with  Ranma." Kasumi said</p><p>and handed her an address.</p><p>"Here is the address. Just go there in a couple  weeks and Ryoga will</p><p>probably be there."</p><p>End Flashback.</p><p>"Well, here we are, Juuban." Akari said as she and  her pig stopped at</p><p>the edge of a large park at the edge of the Jubaan  shopping district.</p><p>"We might as well camp here for the night before we  head towards Ranma's</p><p>new place."</p><p>She quickly set up a small campsite and started a  small fire. As she</p><p>cooked a small meal for herself and prepared  something for her pig, she</p><p>failed to notice as a figure appeared behind her,  just outside of the</p><p>ring of light from the fire.</p><p>Ryoga reluctantly laid back on the bed in Ranma's  room. He had let</p><p>himself be convinced to stay for the rest of the  week to help train the</p><p>others, telling himself that it would be too much  work to train someone</p><p>else up to his level to fight with. Already Ranma  has twice as strong as</p><p>when they had first started his retraining, and at  the rate they were</p><p>going, he would be as good as before the accident in  another week or</p><p>two.</p><p>"Thanks for staying Ryoga." Ranma said quietly from  the other bed across</p><p>the room.</p><p>"No problem." Ryoga said and then turned his gaze  back to the ceiling.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Ranma asked worriedly. It was very  rare that Ryoga was</p><p>this quiet and contemplative.</p><p>"I don't know. Just a bad feeling, I guess. Like  something was going to</p><p>happen very soon."</p><p>"Things have been very quiet lately. No new attacks  or anything." Ranma</p><p>said and suddenly the communicator that Luna had  given to all the new</p><p>knights, well, Serena had given him his, started to  beep. Grabbing it,</p><p>he opened the lid and found Rei's face on the small  screen.</p><p><i>'Everyone! Get to the park as soon as you can. There  is another attack.'</i></p><p>She snapped and turned her communicator off as she  went to follow her</p><p>own directions.</p><p>"You want to come?" Ranma asked Ryoga as he got up  and the lost boy</p><p>nodded. Ranma quickly and silently transformed into  Jupiter Knight and</p><p>jumped out the window.</p><p>Ryoga wiggled into his clothes and scooped up his  pack in case he got</p><p>lost on the way there or on the way back and  followed Jupiter K. out the</p><p>window. Serena and Rini joined them a moment later  as Sailor Moon and</p><p>Sailor Chibi Moon and the four of them ran down the  street. As the</p><p>approached the park, they were joined by Sailors  Mercury and Saturn, and</p><p>the two Saturn Knights who had been spending the  night with Hotaru since</p><p>no one else had been home, Chibi-Mercury K., and  Tuxedo Mask.</p><p>The arrived at the park to see, Sailor Mars, Mars  K., Mercury K., Chibi-</p><p>Mars K., and Chibi-Venus K already there. Sailor Pluto,  Pluto K., and</p><p>Chibi-Pluto K. appeared a moment later from a portal  from the time</p><p>gates. Everyone then turned towards the monster and  it's victim.</p><p>"No…Akari!" Ryoga screamed as he got a good look  at the person.</p><p>Rushing forward, he landed a crushing blow on the  monster's face and</p><p>scooped her up as it dropped her. As he retreated  with his precious</p><p>burden, the others jumped forward to try and destroy  the monster that</p><p>looked like a tree.</p><p>"Akari? Akari, can you hear me?" he demanded as he  put her down a safe</p><p>distance from the fight. Saturn was there as well to  heal her, but Akari</p><p>was too far-gone. She only had enough strength to  smile as him briefly,</p><p>before the last of her energy was drained and she  died quietly in his</p><p>arms.</p><p>"NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" he screamed as  he held her close to</p><p>his chest, tears running down his face. Saturn was  also crying silently</p><p>as she realized that there was nothing that she  could do.</p><p>The entire fight had come to a stop at his heart  broken wail as the</p><p>others stared at him in shock. Never had any of them  ever heard anything</p><p>that full of pain and sorrow. Even the monster was  frozen as it watched</p><p>the boy rock back and forth slightly as he wailed  his grief to the</p><p>heavens.</p><p>Gently, Ryoga placed her body on the round and stood  up. A sickly green</p><p>aura surrounded him, faster and bigger than Ranma  had ever seen before.</p><p>As Ryoga turned around to glare at the monster, he  whispered, "You have</p><p>taken everything from me. I have nothing left."  Rising his hands, a ball</p><p>of the green aura filled it, growing bigger, and  bigger until it had to</p><p>be almost four feet in diameter. "I'll make you pay  for this. Shi  Shi</p><p>Hokodan!"  he screamed the last three words as he released the ball of ki</p><p>at  the startled monster.</p><p>The  creature screamed as it disintegrated, leaving nothing behind but a</p><p>pile  of scorched wood dust that disappeared after a moment. Ebonite</p><p>quietly  disappeared from his hiding spot before any of the others could</p><p>discover  him. He had to report this new fighter to his queen.</p><p>"Ryoga?  Are you all right?" Ranma asked as he detransformed and went to</p><p>where  his friend had slumped to the ground, tired from using that much</p><p>energy  in his attack.</p><p>Ignoring  him, Ryoga pushed himself to his feet and wearily turned back</p><p>to  Akari's still form. Brushing back her hair from her pale face, he let</p><p>a  few more tears slip down his face before he reached into his pack,</p><p>which  was right next to him and pulled out a small black box. Most of</p><p>the  people there gasped as they realized what it was. Opening the box,</p><p>he  pulled out a diamond ring and slipped it on Akari's ring finger</p><p>before  standing up.</p><p>"This  is…all your…fault Ranma." He said softly and turned murderous eyes</p><p>towards  the startled pigtailed boy.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You  heard me. If you hadn't convinced me to stay and help you train, it</p><p>you  hadn't been so selfish, I would have been free to find Akari. She</p><p>wouldn't  have come here and she wouldn't have been mixed up in one of</p><p>your  battles. She's dead because of you, Ranma, and I can never forgive</p><p>you  for that. The next time I see you, you die." He said and turned</p><p>towards  Akari's small camp.</p><p>He  packed it up quickly and found the sumo pig where it had been knocked</p><p>out  when the monster had first arrived. Waking it up, he loaded it with</p><p>her  things before turning back to the others. "Sailor Pluto. Transport</p><p>me  to Akari's home. I know you can do that." He said coldly and she</p><p>nodded.  Shouldering his pack, he picked up Akari's body and followed the</p><p>time  scout into a portal, the pig bringing up the rear of the train.</p><p>The  two Pluto knights stayed behind to give him some privacy and they</p><p>watched  silently as the portal closed before turning towards the others.</p><p>Everyone  had detransformed by then and were standing in little groups.</p><p>Duo, Hotaru, Shin, Darien, Serena, Rini, and Lita  were gathered around a</p><p>white-faced Ranma, trying to convince him that it  wasn't his fault. Ami,</p><p>Heero, and Odin were standing near them. Wufei, Rei  and Matt were</p><p>standing a little bit away from them and Tai was  standing alone near a</p><p>large tree. Quickly, Trowa and Triton changed back  and headed towards</p><p>the small blond who looked like he was a bout to  break down in tears.</p><p>As soon as they reached him, he lunged into Trowa's  arms and started</p><p>crying as the taller man started trying to comfort  him.</p><p>In the time gates, Sailor Pluto turned towards the  angry teen behind her</p><p>and sighed. It was a tragedy that his girlfriend had  died and she could</p><p>understand his anger, but she wasn't sure what to do  to help him.</p><p>"Open the portal already." He snapped at her as he cuddled  Akari's body</p><p>closer to his chest.</p><p>"It wasn't Ranma's fault, you know." She said and he  glared at her.</p><p>Seeing that he wouldn't believe her, she summoned a  view screen from the</p><p>time stream and showed him what would've happened if  he hadn't met up</p><p>with Ranma at the arcade. He watched silently as the  him in the screen</p><p>wandered around, ending up in Russia with Akari  still searching for him.</p><p>He saw he go to the Tendo dojo and talk to Kasumi  and then head towards</p><p>Jubaan, searching for him a long the way. Then he  saw the fight in which</p><p>she was still killed, but the monster also killed  several more people</p><p>before finally being defeated by a powerful attack  from Sailor Moon.</p><p>"See? She still would've died, but many others would  also have died</p><p>along with her." Pluto said softly as she put a hand  on his shoulder.</p><p>"What I see is that it really was his fault. She was  going to his house</p><p>to find me. HIS house! I will never for give him so  why don't you just</p><p>open the portal before I get mad and throw a Shi Shi  Hokodan at you?" he</p><p>snarled as he held out a hand, which began to fill  with green energy.</p><p>Wordlessly, she opened a portal and gestured him  through it. He, his</p><p>burden, and the sumo pig, disappeared into it and  appeared at the front</p><p>of the pig farm that Akari and her family ran.</p><p>"Good luck, Ryoga." She said softly as she closed  the portal and opened</p><p>another one back to the Jubaan Park.</p><p>"It's all my fault." Ranma whispered as he sat down  on the hard ground,</p><p>and stared at his hands.</p><p>"It's not your fault." Duo said firmly and the  others surrounding them</p><p>nodded.</p><p>"Yes it is. If he hadn't stayed to help me, then he  would have found her</p><p>before she came here to find him got killed. I kept  him here, it's my</p><p>fault." Ranma said as he bowed his head.</p><p>"Did you tell her to come here? Did you send the  monster? Did you force</p><p>Ryoga to stay here? No to all three." Duo snapped.  "She came of her own</p><p>free will, Ebonite sent the monster, and Ryoga  stayed as a form of</p><p>apology for what he's done to you in the past. If he  had really wanted</p><p>to, he would have left already."</p><p>"It's still my fault." Ranma said stubbornly.</p><p>"It wasn't your fault, just like it wasn't Heero's  when he accidentally</p><p>killed a bunch of people who were working towards  peace." Duo said</p><p>firmly. Ranma's head shot up to stare at him, along  with most of the</p><p>people who could hear him.</p><p>"What?" Hotaru asked as she tugged on one of Duo's  arms.</p><p>"We were given false information along with our  orders and in fulfilling</p><p>them, he accidentally killed Noventa and those other  guys. It wasn't his</p><p>fault, but it also doesn't change that fact that  those people are dead."</p><p>Duo said then turned his attention to the ground.  Quietly, he said, "I</p><p>blamed myself for a long time about the destruction  of the Maxwell</p><p>church. If I had only got the mobile suit faster,  tried harder, they</p><p>wouldn't be dead. But I recently came to grips with  the fact that I</p><p>would have just ended up dead too, protecting the  church."</p><p>"That wasn't your fault! You couldn't know that the  Alliance would do</p><p>that." Ranma protested as he stared up at the  braided teenager.</p><p>"Yes, I know that now. But you couldn't have know  that she was coming or</p><p>that Ebonite would attack her, either." Duo said  quietly and Ranma</p><p>reluctantly nodded.</p><p>"He is right, you know." Sestuna said from behind  them and everyone</p><p>turned to look at her. She had detransformed after  exiting the portal</p><p>and now was dressed in a purple dress that hugged  her figure. Trowa came</p><p>up behind her, followed by Tai and Triton, and  wrapped his arms around</p><p>her waist and rested his chin on her shoulder as he  stared at the group</p><p>in front of them.</p><p>"I showed Ryoga a timeline of what would have  happened if he had never</p><p>met up with all of you. Basically, he would be in  Russia and she still</p><p>would have come here and would still have been  killed, but in that</p><p>timeline, a bunch of others would have died as  well." Sestuna said and</p><p>Trowa hugged her tighter.</p><p>Everyone was silent for a moment before Rei said, "I  think that everyone</p><p>should go home for now. We'll talk about it tomorrow  at the scout</p><p>meeting at the temple. Be there by twelve o'clock."  Nodding, the others</p><p>turned and headed for their homes. Sestuna invited  Trowa, Triton, and</p><p>Tai to come stay at the house with her, Hotaru, and  Hotaru's guests. Rei</p><p>invited Matt and Wufei to stay at the temple and  Darien invited Heero to</p><p>stay with him and Odin. Knowing that Ranma couldn't  stay with her</p><p>without raising suspicions, Lita asked Ami to stay  at her apartment.</p><p>That being decided, everyone went their own way,  with Rini and Serena</p><p>walking on either side of Ranma, both holding his  hands as they headed</p><p>back towards their home.</p><p>In the morning at breakfast, Ranma dropped a  bombshell on his family.</p><p>"Everyone, I have an announcement to make." He said  as he sat down at</p><p>the table.</p><p>"What's that dear, and where is Ryoga? I hope he  didn't get lost again."</p><p>Irene said as she put some miso soup in front of  everyone.</p><p>"He didn't get lost. He left late last night." Ranma  started but paused</p><p>for a moment before continuing. He and his cousins  had come up with a</p><p>story last night on the way home about why Ryoga had  left. "His fiancée,</p><p>Akari, was killed last night. He went to go tell her  family."</p><p>"How do you know that? And how did he find out about  her?" Ken asked.</p><p>"We felt that something was going to happen and were  feeling restless so</p><p>we went out for a while to get some air and we ended  up at the park.</p><p>There we saw a tree monster attack her, so we  stepped in to stop it and</p><p>I got hurt. Ryoga took it out in one blast, but it  was to late for her.</p><p>The scouts had arrived just before he took it out  and Saturn tried to</p><p>heal Akari, but she was already gone. The scouts  transported her body</p><p>and Ryoga to her home while Saturn worked on me. She  completely healed</p><p>my back and I'm 100% healthy again, so for my  announcement, I'm leaving</p><p>to get an apartment of my own." Ranma said and  concentrated on his food,</p><p>while the others stared at him.</p><p>"But, why? I thought you were happy here." Irene  said quietly, a few</p><p>tears gathering in her eyes.</p><p>"I have been. All of you have been great, but I  don't want to freeload</p><p>off of you guys forever, and now that I'm all  better, I don't have the</p><p>excuse of my injuries to keep me here. I was  planning on getting an</p><p>apartment near here so that I could be close to you  guys and I noticed</p><p>that there were a lot of job opening around the  business district." He</p><p>said and smiled timidly at his aunt and uncle.</p><p>"Were are you going to get the money for an  apartment? Ken asked.</p><p>"I have some saved up in an account in the bank of  Tokyo, and there</p><p>should be enough in there for a couple months rent,  plus some</p><p>necessities that I'll need to get, like a futon, a  refrigerator, a</p><p>couch and couple other odds and ends." Ranma said  and poked at his food</p><p>for a little bit, before putting down his chopsticks  and stood up. That</p><p>was when the others realized that he wasn't wearing  his braces or had</p><p>his crutches nearby.</p><p>"Excuse me. I'm going to start looking for a place  to stay." He said and</p><p>turned towards the living room where the morning  paper was waiting.</p><p><i>'What?'</i> Mina screeched over the  phone as Serena held it away from her</p><p>ear in pain.</p><p>"You heard me. Ranma is moving out and Ryoga's  fiancée was killed." She</p><p>repeated as he brought the phone back to her poor  abused ear.</p><p><i>'We're only about an hour away from the Tokyo  airport so we'll be there </i></p><p><i>in about an hour and a half.'</i>  Mina said, then exchanged farewells with</p><p>Serena before they hung up.</p><p>"What's going to happen between Ranma and Ryoga the  next time they</p><p>meet?" Rini asked quietly in the silence after  Serena had hung up.</p><p>"I don't know, but hopefully, they'll be able to  work out heir</p><p>differences without killing each other. I know that  Ranma wouldn't be</p><p>able to live with himself if e did anything to  Ryoga, but I think that</p><p>Ryoga is serious about what he said before he left."  Serena said and</p><p>Luna nodded from where she sat on the bed next to  the two girls. They</p><p>had retired there after Ranma had begun his search  for his new apartment</p><p>to let the others know what was going on. Just as  Serena had finished</p><p>calling the others that were still in town, Mina had  called from the</p><p>plane as she and Quatre were nearing home. She had  promised she would</p><p>tell Haruka, Michiru and the three knights what had  happened.</p><p>"I just hope that everything works out." Serena  sighed as she clasped a</p><p>pillow to her chest.</p><p>An hour and a half later, Mina and Quatre rang the  doorbell and were</p><p>immediately ushered inside by Serena. As soon as  they were in her room,</p><p>Serena explained everything and at the end of the  story, Quatre shook</p><p>his head.</p><p>"They seemed so close. How could Ryoga mean that?"  he asked and Serena</p><p>spoke up, as she was more familiar with Ranma and  Ryoga's past than</p><p>anyone else there.</p><p>"Ranma and Ryoga went to jr. high together years ago  and they were</p><p>always fighting because Ranma would always bet the last  bread of the day</p><p>before Ryoga could and Ryoga decided that Ranma had  slighted his honor.</p><p>So he challenged Ranma to an honor dual. Ranma  waited three days for him</p><p>behind Ryoga's house, but because of his bad  direction, Ryoga got there</p><p>on the fourth day after Ranma had left to continue  his training journey.</p><p>He followed him to China where something happened.  I'm not sure what</p><p>happened to him, but because of it, he decided that  he had to kill Ranma</p><p>because it was Ranma's fault. In Nerima, he was  always trying to kill</p><p>him, but they were also friends to a certain extent.  Now, it's going to</p><p>be just like it was then, but now, Ryoga doesn't  consider Ranma his</p><p>friend anymore." She finished quietly.</p><p>"This is horrible." Mina said as she hugged one of  the stuffed toys to</p><p>her chest.</p><p>"I just hope that both of them make it through  this." Quatre said</p><p>quietly and the others could only nod in agreement.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Serena spoke up again in  an attempt to change</p><p>the subject. "So, what happened in England. Did you  get that guy in</p><p>trouble?"</p><p>"Yes, and I have more news, too!" Mina exclaimed,  glad they weren't</p><p>talking about Ranma and Ryoga anymore. "Uranus and  Neptune Knights will</p><p>be joining us in a few days and the war is over!"</p><p>"What? Really?" Serena exclaimed happily.</p><p>"Really. While we were there, Haruka and Michiru  arrived there and told</p><p>them and restored their memories." Quatre said with  a smile at the two</p><p>bubbly blonds in front of him. "They are having  peace talks with the</p><p>colony leaders right now and then, when the matter  is settled, the four</p><p>of them are coming here. They should be here in a  couple days."</p><p>"That is so cool! We have to call a scout and knight  meeting at the</p><p>temple as soon as possible." Serena said as she  opened her communicator</p><p>and called the others, who agreed to meet them there  at twelve.</p><p>"Well, I think I want to get back to the house and  see what happened</p><p>there since we were gone." Quatre said as he stood  up with a smile on</p><p>his face.</p><p>"Yeah, and I want to check in with Artemis." Mina said  as she stood up</p><p>as well. Exchanging goodbyes, they left and Serena  went in search of</p><p>Luna to talk to.</p><p>Far away in America, a teenage girl with long brown  hair with green</p><p>streaks died though out the huge mass and brilliant  blue eyes, entered</p><p>an airport wearing baggy black jeans and a black  tank top with the</p><p>picture of an angel with black wings that had the  words "Fallen Angel"</p><p>above it. She was carrying a backpack and two  suitcases as she hurried</p><p>over to the desk to have her suitcases put on the  plane.</p><p>Within fifteen minutes, she was at the gate leading  to the plane, which</p><p>would bring here to Tokyo, Japan. 'Just a little bit  longer and then I</p><p>will have my revenge.' She thought as she settled  into her seat with her</p><p>bag in the seat next to here. There was barely  anyone on this flight as</p><p>it was at two o'clock in the morning and those that  were around here</p><p>were already going to sleep.</p><p>After the plane had lifted off and she was sure that  no one else around</p><p>here was going to wake up, she turned to her bag and  unzipped it.</p><p>"It's about time!" a voice said from the bag as  something popped it's</p><p>head out to look at the girl, who showed no surprise  at having a</p><p>miniature fire dragon that talked, pop out of her  bag.</p><p>"I'm sorry, but I had to make sure that no one else  was awake around us</p><p>before I let you out, Terra." The girl said as she  watched the dragon</p><p>wiggle out of the opening and settled around her  neck.</p><p>"How long is this flight?" the dragon, which  happened to be male, asked</p><p>quietly.</p><p>"About six hours, I think. It will be about two  o'clock a.m. when we get</p><p>there, so we should get some sleep."</p><p>"I agree, but you must remember, they probably won't  accept you</p><p>immediately. They don't take well to strangers who  show up, knowing all</p><p>about them while they don't know anything about the  newbe."</p><p>"I guess, but I have to get my revenge, no matter  what. I care if they</p><p>don't trust me. That isn't part of the plan."</p><p>"What ever, just go to sleep. You are going to need  to get some rest if</p><p>you plan on being aware when we get there." Terra  sighed as he closed</p><p>his eyes. "Good night, Lilly."</p><p>"Night Terra." Lilly said as she reclined the back  of her seat and</p><p>closed her eyes.</p><p>TBC</p>
