</div><p>A couple people have asked for various flashbacks of  different couples</p><p>during the sliver millennium. That is what is going  to happen during</p><p>this section. There will be flashbacks of how each  couple met, except</p><p>for Mars and Pluto, because I already did those. I  will also do</p><p>flashbacks of battles, how they fell in love and  their deaths, besides</p><p>Duo and Hotaru because I have already done their  deaths. I will also do</p><p>memories for Lilly and Terra. There will be a couple  parts of Memories,</p><p>I'm not sure how many, but five or under so I'm  warning everyone now, it</p><p>will be a while before the story goes any further.  In chapter 15 or 16</p><p>or so, it will pick up with when Lilly gets there  and then I'll do her</p><p>memories in the chapter after that, or maybe even in  the same one. I'm</p><p>not sure. But these chapters are going to be long,  I'm warning you now.</p><p>Write me and tell me what you think of these  histories. Now, here they</p><p>are.</p><p>Ranma ½: Life, Love, and Death</p><p>Memories part 1</p><p>Saturn and Mercury</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>"…so that's what's happening with the others. They  should be back in a</p><p>couple days." Mina said as she finished explaining  everything to the</p><p>others at the scout meeting.</p><p>"Well, I just hope that there aren't any more  attacks before they get</p><p>back." Sestuna said as she leaned back against  Trowa's chest. She was</p><p>currently sitting on his lap while he was sitting on  the floor, leaning</p><p>back against the wall to Rei's room.</p><p>"We could handle it." Heero said coldly. He and Ami  were sitting next to</p><p>each other on the bed with Quatre and Mina sitting  next to them,</p><p>cuddling.</p><p>"Self-destructing to win doesn't count as being able  to handle it and</p><p>you know that you would do that to stop an attack."  Duo said from his</p><p>place next to Sestuna and Trowa, with Hotaru curled  up in his lap. Lita</p><p>was sitting next to him with Ranma further away in  the corner of the</p><p>room, away from everyone. Serena, Rini, and Darien  were sitting together near the bed. Wufei and Rei were on opposite sides of the  room, pointedly ignoring each other, and the five Chibi-knights were clustered</p><p>around the table, pigging out on snacks and looking  at Rei's picture</p><p>albums, not really paying to much attention to what  was going on around</p><p>them.</p><p>Heero didn't bother to respond to Duo, but merely  settled for glaring at</p><p>him.</p><p>"Enough with the glare." Duo said with a grin as he  cuddled Hotaru</p><p>closer. Turning to Ranma, he asked, "Are we having  our training session</p><p>today?"</p><p>"No. I have to check out some apartments." Ranma  said emotionlessly as</p><p>he looked at the braided Knight.</p><p>"When will the next one be then?"</p><p>"When I get my own place and get a job, we will  figure out when we can</p><p>do it. Until then, you practice on your own. You  know at least one kata</p><p>and you can run without my help." Ranma said, then  stood up and left,</p><p>saying goodbye in a soft voice just before he slid  the door closed</p><p>behind him.</p><p>"Well, I guess this meeting is over." Serena said  and the others nodded</p><p>slowly.</p><p>"I have chores to do." Rei said as she too headed for  the door. "I have</p><p>to do all of Chad's chores too."</p><p>"Why? Where's Chad?" Mina asked, looking at her in  concern.</p><p>"We don't know. He just disappeared the night that  we gave the knights</p><p>back their memories. He just vanished. We know he  didn't leave because</p><p>all his things are still here, including his wallet  and money." Rei said</p><p>as she paused by the door. "I wish I knew what  happened to him." She</p><p>sighed as she left, calling over her shoulder, "You  guys can stay or go,</p><p>but please get out of my room."</p><p>Almost everyone decided to leave, the exceptions  being Tai, Wufei, and</p><p>Serena, who wanted to talk to Rei as she worked.</p><p>Duo and Hotaru ended up walking alone together in  the park, just</p><p>enjoying being with each other. Hotaru broke the  silence after a while.</p><p>"Duo, will you tell me about how we met? I can't  remember too much of</p><p>when we were together during the silver millennium."  She said quietly</p><p>and he nodded as they sat down together on a bench  that over looked the</p><p>lake.</p><p>"We meet before I became your knight…" Duo began.</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Come back here, thief!" a soldier shouted as he ran  down the halls of</p><p>the Saturn Palace. He was chasing a young boy about  eight as he ran away</p><p>from him.</p><p>The child was dressed in rags and extremely dirty  and he was carrying a</p><p>loaf of bread and a couple pieces of fruit. Turning  he cast as quick</p><p>look over his shoulder at the guard, as he increased  his speed. Because</p><p>he was looking behind him, he missed seeing one of  the doors to the</p><p>hallway open and a little girl dressed in a fancy  purple dress step out</p><p>to see what all the shouting was about.</p><p>He slammed into her, knocking them both to the  ground. "Ow…" he said as</p><p>he sat up, holding his head where he had banged it  against the floor.</p><p>Looking up, he saw the surprised girl's face, and  froze for a moment</p><p>before he shot to his feet and reached down to grab  the food while he</p><p>said quickly, "I'm sorry, but I got to go."</p><p>She stared at him as he stood up and started  running, but a huge arm</p><p>shot out and grabbed him by the arm, yanking him  backwards. "What…?" she</p><p>managed to gasp as she got her breath back from when  she had lost it</p><p>upon impact with the hard ground.</p><p>"Hey, ouch! Let me, go! OW!" the boy shouted as the  guard twisted his</p><p>arm behind his back.</p><p>"What's going on?" she finally managed to say.</p><p>"I'm sorry, your highness, but the street rat broke  into the kitchen and</p><p>stole some food." The guard said as he bowed to her,  not loosing his</p><p>grip on the boy at all.</p><p>"I need to eat too, ya know! And it's not our fault  we don't have anyone</p><p>to look out for us except oursel…OW!" the boy  screamed as the guard</p><p>tightened his grip on his arm roughly.</p><p>"Please excuse us. I need to take him to the  dungeon. Good day, Princess</p><p>Hotaru." The guard said as he bowed again before  turning away and</p><p>dragging the boy along.</p><p>They were gone before Hotaru could say anything.  Looking down, she saw</p><p>the loaf of bread and the two apples on the floor  and she picked them up</p><p>slowly. She wasn't sure why, but that boy had felt  familiar to her, as</p><p>if he was an old friend she hadn't seen in a long  time, but she knew she</p><p>had never seen him before. Sighing, she turned to go  back into her room,</p><p>when something told her that she had to go see the  boy immediately.</p><p>She had learned to trust her feelings, so she  immediately rushed after</p><p>the guard and the boy, hoping that nothing bad would  happen to him</p><p>before she got there. There had been some rumors  going around that some</p><p>of the dungeon guards liked to torture prisoners for  the smallest things</p><p>and she had a feeling that the huge guard that had  just dragged the boy</p><p>down there was one of them.</p><p>The closer and closer she got to the dungeon,  though, the more the</p><p>feeling of wrongness intensified until she was  shaking as she descended</p><p>the steps that led to it. As she crept down the last  few steps and</p><p>peeked around the corner, a sudden scream sent her  tripping backwards</p><p>until she fell as her foot hit the bottom step.</p><p>The scream trailed off and she gathered her courage  to look around the</p><p>corner. What she saw, froze her blood in shock and  horror.</p><p>Two guards were hold the boy up by his arms while a  third beat him about</p><p>the face and another one was behind the boy, raping  him. That was what</p><p>had caused him to scream. Now he just hung there,  tears streaming down</p><p>his face and he fought to keep the screams from  emerging from his mouth.</p><p>All that were coming out were tiny whimpers that  seemed to encourage the</p><p>guard behind him. The guard picked up the pace as he  pounded into him</p><p>until, suddenly, he threw back his head with a roar  of completion.</p><p>As he drew out of the boy, Hotaru could see blood on  him with even more</p><p>dripping onto the ground from the boy. She watched  in horror as the</p><p>guard traded places with one of the men hold his  arms while the man that</p><p>had been beating him now lowered his pants and  shoved himself into the</p><p>boy's mouth, causing him to choke as he squeezed his  eyes tightly shut.</p><p>When the man behind shoved into him again, his eyes  flew open as another</p><p>muffled scream tried to work its way out around the  cock in his mouth.</p><p>His pain filled violet eyes locked with Hotaru's  horrified ones and</p><p>seemed to convey the message of 'HELP!' to her.  Abruptly she spun away</p><p>and raced quietly up the stairs. Slipping back into  the palace hallways,</p><p>she caught sight of her mother and father as they  walked down the hall</p><p>together.</p><p>"Mommy, Daddy! Help!" she shouted as she raced  towards them.</p><p>They turned in surprise to see their daughter racing  towards them with</p><p>tears in her eyes. Quickly the King scooped her up  and hugged her as she</p><p>sobbed. "What is it, honey?" he asked concerned as  she clung to him.</p><p>"You have to help him!" she wailed.</p><p>"Help who?" he asked.</p><p>"The boy the guards are hurting. He only tried to  take some bread and</p><p>apples and now they're hurting him!" she cried as  she struggled to be</p><p>let down.</p><p>"What do you mean?" the queen gasped, horrified as  Hotaru grabbed their</p><p>hands and dragged them down the hall to the door  that led down to the</p><p>dungeon. She opened the door just as another muffled  scream was wrenched</p><p>from the boy.</p><p>Immediately the royal family rushed down the steps,  but stopped in shock</p><p>when they saw what was going on. The boy was  dangling between two men as</p><p>the other two pounded into him, causing the thin  body to shake and</p><p>shiver. He would have collapsed already if the two  weren't holding him</p><p>up and he slipped into unconsciousness as soon as he  saw Hotaru and her</p><p>parents.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" the king roared,  causing the four guards</p><p>to freeze in shock. They had been so wrapped up what  they were doing</p><p>they hadn't even realized that they weren't alone  anymore.</p><p>"Yo…your Majesties!" one of the men stuttered as he  hurriedly pulled up</p><p>his pants. The others also straightened their clothes,  dropping the boy</p><p>on the ground. "um…err…that is…I mean.." the guard  trailed off</p><p>uncertainly as he looked over at one of the others,  who happened to be</p><p>the one that had been chasing the boy earlier.</p><p>"You will explain yourself later." The King snapped  then quickly took</p><p>off his cape and bundled the boy into it. Carefully,  he rushed up the</p><p>stairs with his wife and daughter right behind him.</p><p>They took him to the infirmary where Hotaru and her  mother used their</p><p>healing powers to heal him of most of the damage.  However, they didn't</p><p>have enough energy to finish healing all the  bruises. He woke up after</p><p>they had stopped to slump in their chairs and he sat  up quickly and</p><p>tried to get away from them, but only managed to end  up falling off the</p><p>bed.</p><p>As he hit the floor hard, the king leaned over him,  intending to pick</p><p>him up and put him back on the bed, but he stopped  as he saw the terror</p><p>on his face and the way he cringed. "Hotaru, will  you come here, and</p><p>help me. We need to get him back on the bed, but he  seems terrified of</p><p>me. Maybe a girl would help calm him down." The king  said and she</p><p>hurried around the corner of the bed.</p><p>As soon as he saw her, he lunged at her and grabbed  her as if she was a</p><p>lifeline and he was drowning. Clinging to her, he buried  his head into</p><p>her shoulder and started crying, though she could  hear him faintly</p><p>repeating to himself, "Boy's don't cry, boy's don't  cry." She managed to</p><p>get them both sitting on the edge of the bed, but he  refused to let go</p><p>of her, even as his tears trailed off.</p><p>"What's your name?" she whispered to him and she  faintly heard him say</p><p>Duo. The Queen wrapped a sheet around him as he was  still dressed only</p><p>in his torn rags that didn't really cover anything.</p><p>"Well Duo, would you like to stay here for a while?"  the queen asked as</p><p>she sat down next to him and he hesitantly looked at  her before nodding</p><p>slowly.</p><p>"That's wonderful. We'll have a room prepared for  you near Hotaru's</p><p>since you seem calmer near her." She said with a  gentle smile and he</p><p>smiled in return before it left his face and he  buried his face in</p><p>Hotaru's shoulder again.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"I stayed with you and your family for a couple  months after that until</p><p>one night someone came into my room and kidnapped  me. I was taken to</p><p>earth for a while and abandoned there. I eventually  forgot about my time</p><p>spent at the palace with you and your family,  believing that it was all</p><p>a big dream. I entered the Earth's army where I  earned the nickname</p><p>Shinigami." Duo said and paused to draw a breath.</p><p>It had been incredibly painful for him to talk about  what had happened</p><p>to him, but he had needed to talk about it since he  had remembered it</p><p>and she had the right to know, so it worked out for  the both of them.</p><p>"That was horrible!" Hotaru exclaimed as she  shuddered and leaned on</p><p>him.</p><p>Smiling gently, he wrapped his arms around her and  said, "I know and I</p><p>had at even worse before I went to stay with you.  But our next meeting</p><p>was much better. It was six years later and I was  fourteen…"</p><p>Flashback</p><p>Duo was exercising when a soldier ran up to him,  waving a letter at him.</p><p>"Duo! You got a letter from someone!" the soldier  shouted as he skidded</p><p>to a stop next to Duo as finished doing his sit ups  and stood up.</p><p>"Who would be sending me a letter?" he wondered out  loud as he took it</p><p>from the man. "Thanks, Kell." He said as he stared  at the envelope in</p><p>his hands.</p><p>"So open it already!" Kell exclaimed after a moment.  Duo laughed</p><p>slightly as he opened it and brought out a couple of  pages.</p><p>Dear Duo,</p><p>I have been looking for you for the last six</p><p>years ever since you were kidnapped from the</p><p>Saturn Royal Palace and I have been desperately</p><p>worried. You were my only friend for those four</p><p>months you stayed with us and it saddened all of</p><p>us when you disappeared. Mother had her friend</p><p>Sailor Mars find you with the sacred fire and so</p><p>at last I could look into your beautiful purple</p><p>eyes and know that you would protect me.</p><p>Apparently, my protector  was killed or went</p><p>missing a long time and I  have the choice of who</p><p>I want to come protect me.  I would be delighted</p><p>if you would come and take  the position, but</p><p>even if you decided that  you don't want to,</p><p>please come back to me. I  don't know how I</p><p>survived the last six  years without you and I</p><p>want to know what has  happened to you during</p><p>this time.</p><p>I have enclosed a royal  order with this letter</p><p>so that you would be able  to come and I dearly</p><p>wish that you would use it  to come back.</p><p>With  all my love,</p><p style="text-align:center;">Princess Hotaru of Saturn</p><p>Firefly</p><p>Duo stared at the letter in his hand while Kell  jumped around next to</p><p>him as he waited impatiently for information on who  had sent the letter</p><p>and what it was all about. Finally, he snatched the  letter out of Duo</p><p>hand, not that he noticed, he was in so much shock.</p><p>Looking over the letter, he caught sight of the  signature at the bottom</p><p>and almost dropped the papers in surprise. "Princess  Hotaru of Saturn</p><p>wrote you a letter? How the hell do you know the  princess of Saturn?"</p><p>he exclaimed, jarring Duo out of his shock and back  to his friend.</p><p>"She saved my life when we were eight and I stayed  with her family for a</p><p>while." Duo snapped and Kell looked at him in shock.</p><p>"…" Kell didn't know what to say and he seemed  frozen as he stared at</p><p>Duo. Duo didn't notice, however as he turned and  hurried to his room to</p><p>pack his few possessions into a bag and then hurried  in the direction of</p><p>his superior's office.</p><p>When he had joined the earth army five years before,  the commanders had</p><p>seen potential in him and had made him into a living  weapon. At the</p><p>tender age of ten he had gone on his first mission  where he had had to</p><p>kill forty men of an opposing army in the middle of  the night. They had</p><p>turned him into a professional killer, the perfect  soldier. Their</p><p>training methods would be considered torture to  everyone else, but they</p><p>had continued to train him like that until he had  almost no emotions and</p><p>would follow every order to the letter, even killing  an five year old</p><p>little girl that had seen him come out of a tent  that he had just killed</p><p>someone. His orders had been to eliminate his target  and any witnesses</p><p>and he had followed those orders. It had driven him  insane and he had</p><p>almost killed his commander when he had returned.  They put him into a</p><p>padded room and he slowly brought him back from  madness. After he had</p><p>been deemed sane, he had been put into a special  team that took care of</p><p>special missions, and he no longer had to kill as  many people anymore.</p><p>Instead, he was doing infiltration and his team took  care of any</p><p>witnesses. While he was against killing innocents,  he would do it if</p><p>there was no other choice.</p><p>He had been surrounded by death and pain since he  could remember and now</p><p>the one person who made everything all right had  sent him away to get</p><p>back to her.</p><p>He knocked on the commander's office door and  entered when bidden. "What</p><p>is it, Shinigami?" the man said as Duo saluted him.</p><p>"I have received royal orders to go immediately to  the royal palace of</p><p>Saturn. I have come to inform you that I will be  leaving within the hour</p><p>on the first transport that I can find." Duo said as  he handed over the</p><p>paper Hotaru had sent with her letter.</p><p>"Well, it seems that I must let you go. When will  you be returning to</p><p>us?"</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe never. I have been offered a  job of being Princess</p><p>Hotaru's protector." Duo said and the commander  looked at him in</p><p>surprise.</p><p>"I see. Well then, you are dismissed."</p><p>Within moments, Duo was back outside the office and  on his way to the</p><p>transporter where he would be shipped out  immediately.  The transporter</p><p>was a machine that converted you to energy and then  shipped that energy</p><p>along a beam that led to a destination. It would  take roughly about two</p><p>minutes as it went around the speed of light. But  they had schedule of</p><p>when they ship people and things along the  transporter so if you miss</p><p>you shipment, it would be another day before there  was another one as</p><p>each destination was connected once a day because  there was only the one</p><p>machine to send things to all the planets and moons  that were a part of</p><p>the Silver Alliance.</p><p>As it turned out, he had timed it perfectly. He had  only enough time to</p><p>step onto the platform with the other people and  objects being</p><p>transported before the machine shipped them.</p><p>When he arrived, he found a beautiful girl his age  with short black hair</p><p>and violet eyes wearing a long purple and black  dress waiting for him.</p><p>He immediately knew that it was Hotaru and she  immediately knew who he</p><p>was. Gracefully, she approached him, stopping just a  few feet away from</p><p>him as he dropped his bag at his feet to bow to her.  As soon as he was</p><p>upright again, though, she discarded formalities and  lunged into his</p><p>arms.</p><p>"I'm so glad you came, Duo." She whispered against  his chest. He had</p><p>just hit a growth spurt and was now at 5'2 and he  was still growing. She</p><p>was 4'11 and so was not that much smaller than he  was.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around her slowly, he whispered  back, "I thought the</p><p>time I spent with you was just a dream. I'm so happy  it wasn't."</p><p>Leaning her head back a little, she looked up at him  and smiled,</p><p>uncaring that everyone else from the transport and  the crew that ran it</p><p>were standing around starring at them. After all,  it's not everyday you</p><p>see the Princess throw herself into the arms of a  soldier from earth.</p><p>"It wasn't a dream and neither is this." She said  and kissed him,</p><p>surprising everyone, including herself and Duo.</p><p>Blushing bright red, she let him go and grabbed his  hand, dragging him</p><p>after her as she hurried towards the coach that  would take them back to</p><p>the palace. Duo tossed his bag up to the coachman  and settled into the</p><p>enclosed carriage across from Hotaru. Within two  minutes, she was</p><p>sitting next to him with her head on his shoulder  and they passed the</p><p>short ride in comfortable silence, as they cuddled  together.</p><p>When they emerged from the carriage at the palace,  the king and Queen</p><p>were waiting for them. The queen immediately swept  him up into a hug</p><p>while the king just settled for shaking his hand.</p><p>"It is so good to see you Duo. We were so worried  about you!" the queen</p><p>said as she hooked one arm around Duo and the other  around Hotaru and</p><p>lead them into the palace.</p><p>"It's good to see you to, Your Majesty. And I didn't  mean to worry you."</p><p>Duo said sheepishly. "I was only around eight when  they kidnapped me and</p><p>took me to earth. I couldn't get transport back or  even try and send you</p><p>a message because no one takes a child very  seriously."</p><p>"That is, unfortunately, all to true. So what have  you been doing since</p><p>then? Mars found you in the Earth army! I mean,  you're just so young.</p><p>Why would you be in the army?" she said and a shadow  passed over his</p><p>face, causing the others to look at him in concern.</p><p>Seeing their worry, he waved his hand and said in a  cheerful, if dark</p><p>way, "When I was nine I went to the army commanders  and applied to</p><p>become a soldier. They don't usually do that with  someone so young, but</p><p>they said I had potential so they took me in for  special training. I</p><p>should have asked what the special training was but  I was just happy</p><p>that I wouldn't have to live on the street anymore."</p><p>"What was the special training about?" the king  asked as they turned</p><p>down a hall where his bedroom was.</p><p>"They made me into Shinigami." He said pulling away  from the queen a</p><p>little. She and the king stared at him in horror  while Hotaru just</p><p>looked confused.</p><p>"What's Shinigami?" she asked and he said softly,  "The god of death."</p><p>"Well, that's perfect then if you accept the  position of my guardian."</p><p>Hotaru said with a smile at the confused boy in  front of her.</p><p>"Why is it good?" he demanded, shuddering at some  unpleasant memories.</p><p>"Because, I'm going to be the Sailor scout of Death,  Destruction, and</p><p>Rebirth. The Messiah of Silence."</p><p>"…what?"</p><p>"I'm going to be Sailor Saturn but Saturn Knight, my  protector is gone.</p><p>You see, the Saturn K. for the last Sailor Saturn  disappeared years ago</p><p>without a son and no one can find him, but without  him or his son, I</p><p>don't have a protector." Hotaru said quietly.</p><p>"I'll protect you until the end. I promise." Duo  said as he bowed to</p><p>her.</p><p>"I'm so glad!" she said as she threw herself into  his arms to give him a</p><p>hug.</p><p>Behind them, they heard someone clear their throat  and they separated</p><p>hastily as they realized that her parents were  there, a little fact that</p><p>had slipped both of their minds. "Well, I'm glad  you're going to become</p><p>Saturn K., but first we need to know more about you.  We didn't go into</p><p>your past the last time you were here, but I would  like to get to know</p><p>you better." The king said and the queen nodded in  agreement.</p><p>Duo nodded reluctantly, then excused himself to  shower and change before</p><p>getting into his past with them, promising to meet  them in the throne</p><p>room as soon as he was done. It took him twenty  minutes to finish his</p><p>shower and another twenty minutes to towel dry his  long hair. He left it</p><p>loose to dry as he put on his clothes, which  consisted of tight black</p><p>breeches and a long sleeved white shirt with a long  sleeved black tunic</p><p>on top. He rolled the sleeves of both shirts up  together so that the</p><p>white of the undershirt was shown on the cuffs just  above his elbow. He</p><p>also put on soft back boots that made it possible  for him to be</p><p>completely silent when he moved.</p><p>Looking at the clock, he gasped as he realized that  he had been getting</p><p>ready for almost an hour and he rushed from the  room, forgetting that</p><p>his hair was still loose. As he raced soundlessly  down the hall, he</p><p>hoped that they hadn't waited there since he had  went for his shower.</p><p>Pausing for a moment out side of the door, he ran  his fingers through</p><p>his hair, just then realizing that he hadn't braided  it. "Damn it." He</p><p>muttered, and then pushed the door open. Inside, the  royal family was</p><p>sitting around a small table talking. At his  entrance, they looked up at</p><p>him, though only Hotaru smiled.</p><p>"Your Majesties, I'm sorry I'm so late." He said as  he bowed to them.</p><p>"It's ok, Duo. With that much hair, I guess it takes  awhile to get it</p><p>clean." Hotaru said as she motioned him to take the  seat next to her's.</p><p>"It does, and I forgot to braid it before coming  here. It's going to be</p><p>a pain to brush tonight." Duo said with a wry smile  as he sat down.</p><p>"I can braid it for you." she said as she jumped up  from her seat.</p><p>Within a few minutes, the huge mass of hair had been  plaited, despite</p><p>his protests that he could do it later. "There." She  said as she tied</p><p>off the end with the leather tie he had grudgingly  handed her. "All</p><p>done!"</p><p>"Thank you princess." He said with a smile as he  bowed his head towards</p><p>her respectively.</p><p>"Please stop with the bowing. We're friends right?"  she demanded and he</p><p>nodded slowly. After a moment of silence, she asked,  "Where did you get</p><p>that tattoo from? It's really neat looking."</p><p>"What tattoo?" the queen asked, finally speaking up.  She wasn't sure if</p><p>she liked the idea that her daughter's protector  having tattoos.</p><p>"I don't think it's a tattoo. I've had it for as  long as I can remember</p><p>and I don't think someone would have their child  tattooed before they</p><p>were even five." Duo said as he reached up and  touched the back of his</p><p>neck under his hair. That was where it was, but he  had never seen it</p><p>before. He had had some other people tell him about  it the few times he</p><p>let anyone touch his hair and they had seen it. The  first person to see</p><p>it was Gent, another street rat he had lived with  when he was five. Gent</p><p>had always brushed out his hair for him at night  before going to sleep</p><p>and had commented on it once before he died.</p><p>"It's a glaive and a scythe crossing each other."  Hotaru said and they</p><p>looked sharply at Duo for a moment before the queen  stood up and came</p><p>around the table.</p><p>"Let me see it." She demanded and he reluctantly  moved his hair away</p><p>from his neck. Sure enough in the center of his neck  was a picture of</p><p>the Silence Glaive and a scythe crossed at the  handles with the blade of</p><p>the scythe passing behind the blade of the glaive.  The detail was</p><p>excellent and suddenly, the queen knew exactly who  Duo was.</p><p>As she took her seat again, she asked him, "Duo, do  you remember your</p><p>family?"</p><p>"Not really. I remember someone with really long  black hair, but that's</p><p>about it." He said confused. "Why?"</p><p>"Well, Duo, you just confirmed a suspicion I had.  You see, the protector</p><p>of Sailor Saturn had a hereditary symbol of the  Silence Glaive and the</p><p>Death Scythe crossed. Most knights have some symbol  that will identify</p><p>they as knights, but not all of them are in the same  place. The previous</p><p>Saturn K. had it on his shoulder and the one before  him had it at the</p><p>base of his spine on the small of his back. This  mark cannot be</p><p>duplicated and you have the mark."</p><p>"I what?" Duo exclaimed as he stared at her in  shock.</p><p>"You are the son of Saturn Knight. There for, you  are Hotaru's protector</p><p>by right of birth." The queen said with a soft smile  at the young man</p><p>across from her.</p><p>"This is great!" Hotaru shout as she jumped up and  wrapped her arms</p><p>around him. This was so unlike the Hotaru that  everyone knew, the others</p><p>stared at her for a moment. Not even two seconds  after Duo had gotten</p><p>over his shock at finding out that someone knew  something about his</p><p>past, he jumped up and started dancing around in joy  with Hotaru.</p><p>The king and queen let them carry on for a few  minutes before they</p><p>approached them, their faces wreathed in smiles.  "Duo, Hotaru, it is</p><p>time for you to take your places in this world." The  queen said as she</p><p>pulled out a transformation wand and handed it to  Hotaru, then took out</p><p>a transformation disk with a scythe on it and handed  it to Duo.</p><p>"Hotaru, say Saturn Planet Power and you will  transform into Sailor</p><p>Saturn. I have a more advanced wand that you will  inherit when you are</p><p>ready." The queen said and her daughter nodded.</p><p>"Saturn Planet POWER!" Hotaru shouted as she  raised the wand above her</p><p>head. She was engulfed in a bright purple light.  When it cleared, she</p><p>was dressed in a sailor uniform with dark blue skirt  and collar and</p><p>black bows in front and behind at the top of the skirt.  White gloves</p><p>with dark blue material at the top encased her arms  and a tiara with a</p><p>dark blue stone in it rested on her forehead. On her  feet were boots the</p><p>same shade as her skirt that laced up to her knees.</p><p>As she studied herself, Duo also found himself doing  the same. She may</p><p>be only fourteen, but in that outfit, it made her  look much older and</p><p>much sexier. "Wow…" was all he could say as he took  in the short skirt</p><p>and the skintight body suit. "You look great."</p><p>Hotaru blushed and looked down, tugging on the skirt  to try and make it</p><p>cover more of her.</p><p>"Now it is your turn, Duo." The king said, snapping  the kid out of his</p><p>musings. "You don't need to say anything to  transform, but if you need</p><p>something to help get going, just say something like  Saturn Knight</p><p>Power."</p><p>Nodding, Duo stepped back and held up the disk.  "Saturn Knight Power!"</p><p>he shouted. A black and purple light covered him and  formed a gray</p><p>uniform with a black cape thrown over his shoulders  and a dark purple</p><p>mask appeared over his eyes. Then, to the surprise  of all, two things</p><p>happened. In his hands appeared the Death Scythe.  The blade was made out</p><p>of a silver looking metal that glowed in the light  and a deep brown</p><p>wooden shaft supported it. While it looked just like  a regular farm</p><p>implement, Duo could feel the power that coursed  through it, making it</p><p>almost vibrate in his hands.</p><p>The second surprise, though, was much more of a  shock. As the last of</p><p>the black and purple light disappeared, two great  big black leathery</p><p>wings sprouted from his back. Duo felt no pain as it  happened, but</p><p>instead felt as though something that had been  missing had returned.</p><p>Spreading them, he flapped them once and suddenly,  he was in the air,</p><p>hovering just about the others' startled heads.</p><p>"Uh, mom? Where did the wings come from?" Hotaru  asked as she looked up</p><p>in wonderment.</p><p>"There was a prophesy about Saturn K. that has been  passed down for</p><p>generations. It is said that when the one destined  to wield the Death</p><p>Scythe, which disappeared thousands of years ago,  took up his</p><p>transformation, it would appear in his hands and  great black wings would</p><p>carry him to his destiny." The queen said, awed by  the sight of the</p><p>hovering fighter.</p><p>"Destiny? What destiny? I though it was to protect  Sailor Saturn."</p><p>Saturn K. said as he gently came to rest on the  floor again.</p><p>"You have two destinies." The queen said. "One is to  protect Sailor</p><p>Saturn. But the other one is unknown to us. The  prophecy said that only</p><p>he would know it when the time came."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>"Is there anyway to make the wings disappear?" the  king asked suddenly.</p><p>"I think so. Hold on a minute." Duo said and closed  his eyes in</p><p>concentration. After a moment, he opened his eyes  and said, "There."</p><p>Suddenly the wings dissipated like smoke. "I think  I'll be able to keep</p><p>them from forming when I transform now."</p><p>"Why?" Hotaru asked.</p><p>"Well, I don't want anyone to see them yet. What the  enemy doesn't know</p><p>can be a great advantage in battle." Duo said as he  dismissed the Death</p><p>Scythe to some subspace pocket to keep it there  until he needed it.</p><p>"Well, here's to a new beginning." The King said as  he picked up his</p><p>glass of wine from the table.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"After that, we trained with each other and the  others, got stronger,</p><p>and fell in love. The others never did find out  about my wings and we</p><p>never mentioned it to anyone." Duo said, finishing  his story.</p><p>Hotaru didn't say anything for a moment as she  cuddled closer to him,</p><p>thinking about what he had told her. Now that he had  reminded her, she</p><p>was starting to remember them herself. Finally, she  asked, "Duo, can you</p><p>make your wings appear when you're not in uniform?"</p><p>"Yes, I can. Why, you want a ride?" he asked he, a  teasing glint in his</p><p>eyes.</p><p>"Yes." She said simply and stood up. They had been  there for a few hours</p><p>and it was now almost four o'clock. Standing, he  concentrated and his</p><p>wings formed quickly, seeming to ooze out of his  back.</p><p>"Hang on." He said as he scooped her into his arms  and took off. As they</p><p>flew, they spotted Heero and Ami standing next to  the lake talking.</p><p>"Ami, thanks for coming with me to talk." Heero said  as he stared out at</p><p>the waters of the lake.</p><p>"It's not a problem, Heero. What did you want to  talk about?" Ami asked</p><p>as she turned to look at her companion.</p><p>"I want to know what you know about us in the past.  I can remember some</p><p>things, but not everything."</p><p>"What do you remember?" she asked curious.</p><p>"Our first meeting and training a little bit." He  said after a pause.</p><p>"I don't remember those, but I have some memories of  battles where we</p><p>fought together and our deaths." She said quietly.  "Why don't we tell</p><p>each other what we remember? I've found if someone  talks about something</p><p>from then, it stimulates our memories and you start  to remember things</p><p>faster."</p><p>"Since I remember our first meeting, I'll go first."  He said and led her</p><p>over to a bench and sat down while he collected his  thoughts. Finally he</p><p>started his story.</p><p>"We met on the day we got our transformations…"</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Ami, I would like you to meet the son of a very  dear friend of mine."</p><p>The Queen of Mercury said as she entered the library  in the Mercury</p><p>palace. Ami was sitting at a table, surrounded by  books and papers as</p><p>she filled a notebook with notes as she read from  one of the thick</p><p>volumes.</p><p>At her mother's entrance, she put her pen down and  stood up, turning</p><p>towards her mother and a boy about her age that was  standing next to</p><p>her. He was about 5'4 with messy brown hair that  hung in his cobalt blue</p><p>eyes a little bit. He was dressed in a tunic and  hose with designs of</p><p>drops of water in various shade of blue at the hem,  collar, and cuffs of</p><p>the tunic. He also had dark blue boots made of the  softest leather on</p><p>his feet.</p><p>"Ami, this is Odin. He and his father are visiting  us and I need to talk</p><p>to his father privately for a while. I want you to  get to know Odin here</p><p>and show him around." The queen said and Ami nodded.  Within a few</p><p>moments, they were alone in the huge library,  silently starring at each</p><p>other, each trying to figure a way to break the  uncomfortable silence</p><p>without making a fool of themselves.</p><p>Finally, Odin looked around and spotted the pile of  books that Ami had</p><p>been studying. "What were you working on?" he asked  and Ami immediately</p><p>latched onto the topic.</p><p>"These are medical texts centered on surgical  procedures and the anatomy</p><p>of various sentient species of beings around the  universe. There are</p><p>also a couple books on the work of several herbalists  and what herbs can</p><p>cure or stall which sickness." She said happily as  she lead the way over</p><p>to the table and pointed out various books.</p><p>"You want to be a doctor?" he asked and she nodded.</p><p>"I would love to be able to help people and not just  as a queen when I</p><p>grow up." She said and he nodded.</p><p>"That has always been my dream to be a doctor. Tell  me have you read to</p><p>book about Diakioustopia by Dr. Honard?" he asked as  he held out a chair</p><p>for Ami then sat down next to her. (Don't even try  to look up</p><p>Diakioustopia. I made it up on the spot.)</p><p>"Why, no I haven't. That is a little out of the  range of what I'm</p><p>currently studying. It concerns the brain, right?"  she said and he</p><p>nodded.</p><p>Two hours later when the Queen came looking for  them, she found them</p><p>curled up on opposite ends of a couch discussing  medical things that</p><p>gave the queen a headache whenever she tried to  follow the conversation.</p><p>"Ami, Odin, I would like to speak to both of you  please." She said,</p><p>interrupting before they could get any deeper in  their conversation.</p><p>Nodding, they stood and followed her to the throne  room where Odin's</p><p>father was waiting. Once they were inside and the  guards were dismissed,</p><p>the queen turned to the children and addressed the  children, who looked</p><p>like they wanted to go back to the library and  continue their</p><p>discussion.</p><p>"Ami, Odin, it is time for you to help make the  universe a better</p><p>place." She said and they looked at her confused.</p><p>"What do you mean, mother?" Ami asked, not sure if  she really wanted to</p><p>know judging by the look in her mom's eyes.</p><p>"What I mean, dear, is that it is your turn to take  up the mantel of</p><p>being Sailor Mercury as I once did, just like it is  time for Odin to</p><p>become Mercury Knight, just like his father before  him."</p><p>Ami and Odin looked at each other for a moment  before they turned to</p><p>their respective parents. "What?" they asked at the  same time. In</p><p>response, the queen pulled out a wand and quickly  called out her</p><p>transformation phrase even as Odin's father pulled  out a dark blue disk</p><p>with a picture of a drop of water on it and quietly  transformed into</p><p>Mercury K. When the lights cleared, they looked at  their parents in</p><p>shock.</p><p>The queen was now dressed as Eternal Sailor Mercury.  Her skirt had three</p><p>layers, a dark blue on the bottom and a light blue  on top, and a white</p><p>layer between them. Her poof sleeves were dark blue  and her light blue</p><p>bows were more angular and had a heart shaped  center. Her back bow also</p><p>had two long streamers coming from it that reached  to her ankles. Her</p><p>blue boots had spiked heels. Her gloves had three  shades of blue at the</p><p>top and there was a heart in the center of her blue  choker. On her</p><p>forehead appeared the symbol of Mercury and it  glowed with a gentle blue</p><p>light. Mercury Knight was wearing a gray uniform  with a light blue mask</p><p>and a dark blue lined cape thrown over his  shoulders.</p><p>"How is this possible?" Ami asked as she approached  her mother and</p><p>started circling her, studying her.</p><p>"Magic, dear."</p><p>"There is no such thing as magic. There has to be a  logical</p><p>explanation." She insisted as she touched the skirt  carefully, feeling</p><p>the material between her fingers.</p><p>"How is this, my spiritual energy that helps me keep  the kingdom safe</p><p>manifests it's self, converting water and other  stray molecules in the</p><p>air to form my outfit. Then, when I do my attacks,  the water molecules</p><p>condense together in one point and my energy wills  it to do an attack."</p><p>The queen said and Ami nodded thoughtfully. "Now it  is time for your own</p><p>transformation."</p><p>"Yes, mother." Ami said as she accepted the blue  transformation wand</p><p>from the queen. "Mercury Power!" Within moments, she  was dressed in a</p><p>blue sailor scout uniform with light blue bows and  dark blue material</p><p>forming the skirt, collar, choker, boots and the  material at the top of</p><p>the white gloves that reached her elbows. A tiara  with a blue gem on her</p><p>forehead completed the outfit and she stood next to  her mother as they</p><p>watched as Odin received his new powers.</p><p>"Odin, do you promise to care and protect Princess  Ami of Mercury, also</p><p>known now as Sailor Mercury until it is time for you  to pass it on to</p><p>your successor or until your deaths?" Mercury K.  demanded and Odin</p><p>nodded firmly. "Then reach forth your hand." As he  handed over the disk,</p><p>Mercury K.'s uniform flickered and transferred it's  self to Odin. "Here</p><p>is your sword, the Wave Crusher." He said, handing  Odin a double blade</p><p>sword which had blue leather wrapped around the  hilt.</p><p>"Congratulations, you two. Now you will be able to  help the universe</p><p>much more than you normally would be able to."</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"The only training I remember is on Mercury…." Heero  continued.</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Ami, I've been working on a new attack. Would you  like to spar a little</p><p>so that I could show you and you can work on your  bubbles?" Odin asked</p><p>as he entered the library to see the princess he had  sworn to protect</p><p>sitting on a couch reading a thick book, which she  put down and nodded.</p><p>"Sure. I want to see if I can get them to be denser.  At the moment,</p><p>they're not thick enough to really help to much."  She said as she put</p><p>her book aside and stood up.</p><p>Once they were transformed and in the practice area,  they stood at</p><p>opposite ends of the yard and prepared to attack.  Sailor Mercury started</p><p>first, sending a wave of mist over the yard as she  rushed forward to</p><p>throw a kick at him. He dodged the kick easily, but  then sent a bunch of</p><p>kicks and punches back at her to put her on the  defensive. She jumped</p><p>out of the way of the last punch and prepared her  bubbles again.</p><p>At the same time he jumped back and held out his  hands in front of him,</p><p>a misty looking ball of energy appeared in them.  With a shout of "Ice</p><p>Illusion!" the mist sped towards her before she  could release her own</p><p>attack, surrounding her completely. "Show her her  worst fears." He</p><p>commanded the attack and stopped to watch what  happened. This was the</p><p>first time he had tried this so he wasn't sure how  it would react. If he</p><p>had been thinking clearly instead of with his  excitement, he would have</p><p>know that this was not the type you used against  your partner,</p><p>especially if that partner was a sweet girl who  hated violence but would</p><p>fight if it was needed.</p><p>In the icy mist, Mercury looked around and froze as  she saw her mother</p><p>being killed as a blast of energy hit her. It also  destroyed a good</p><p>portion of the palace and she could do nothing. As  she watched</p><p>helplessly, she saw the rest of the palace destroyed  and all her friends</p><p>and family that hadn't died in the initial blasts  killed by soldiers</p><p>that swarmed over every inch of the palace, raping  the few women left,</p><p>herself included and killing the remaining men,  including Odin.</p><p>Finally, she screamed and collapsed. Realizing that  maybe it wasn't such</p><p>a good idea after all, Mercury k. hurried over to  her as the icy mist dissipated, their job done, to reveal Mercury curled up on  her side,</p><p>shivering on the ground.</p><p>"Ami! Ami are you all right?" he exclaimed as he  rushed up to her.</p><p>Before he even got to her, she passed out and her  scout uniform</p><p>flickered and disappeared, leaving her in her dress  once more. Quickly</p><p>he detransformed too and carried her to her room  where he put her to bed</p><p>and watched over her until she woke up which was  when he promptly begged</p><p>her forgiveness.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"I still can't believe that I hit you with that  attack." Heero said as</p><p>he stared out the waters of the lake.</p><p>"Heero, anyone can make a mistake, you know." Ami  said as she put a hand</p><p>on his arm, causing him to look at her in a little  bit of surprise. No</p><p>one usually touched him willingly, even the other  pilots, even Duo</p><p>sometimes.</p><p>"But…" he started to say, but she cut him off  firmly.</p><p>"No. It was a new attack that had never been tested  before. It was</p><p>better that you had tested it on me than some one  else. It might have</p><p>seriously hurt a regular human or it might have done  something</p><p>completely different than you had meant it to do. I  at least had a</p><p>chance to defend my self against it if something  went wrong."</p><p>"Something did go wrong! It worked on you and showed  you your worst</p><p>fears! You couldn't stop it and you were in the  infirmary in a coma for</p><p>three days!" Heero shouted angrily, loosing his  temper for the first</p><p>time in years as he jumped to his feet and started  to pace in front of</p><p>the bench. Even when he had lost his temper at Duo  or Zechs, he was</p><p>always tightly in control at all times.</p><p>"Would it make you feel better if I hit you with one  of my attacks that</p><p>I have been working on?" she asked and he  immediately nodded, a grateful</p><p>expression spreading across his face.</p><p>Standing up, she quickly transformed into Sailor  Mercury and after a</p><p>moment, Heero followed suit. For a moment Sailor  Mercury and Mercury K</p><p>faced each other across a few feet of grass before  she began her attack.</p><p>While Ami was a very nonviolent person, she  understood that until she</p><p>attacked him back with an untried attack, Heero  wouldn't let it go.</p><p>"Mercury Aqua Rhapsody!" she shouted as she strummed  her watery harp</p><p>sending jets of water at Mercury K. He was blasted  back into a tree with</p><p>violent force, his head slamming into the bark with  a sickening crack.</p><p>As he slumped to the ground, leaving a trail of  blood to mark his</p><p>process, she hurried forward to check on him. After  inspecting the</p><p>wounds from the attack and from the tree, she opened  her communicator</p><p>and spoke into it softly for a moment to Hotaru who  answered. Closing</p><p>it, she took off her glove, folded it and pressed it  against the back of</p><p>his head where the skin had split and was bleeding  sluggishly.</p><p>Duo and Hotaru arrived a few minutes later on a  black motorcycle wearing</p><p>matching black leather jackets and full head  helmets. Swinging off the</p><p>back of the bike, Hotaru hurried over to the two  Mercurys with Duo only</p><p>a half a step behind.</p><p>"So tell me what happened again? Heero wanted you to  hit him with your</p><p>attack?" Hotaru asked Ami who nodded while Duo just  sighed in</p><p>exasperation.</p><p>"We were trading memories and he told me about this  one when he tried a</p><p>new attack on my which hurt me. When he was finished  with the story, I</p><p>asked him if it would make him feel any better if I  hit him with one of</p><p>my new attacks that I hadn't tried yet and he seemed  so grateful about</p><p>having a way to erase his guilt that I hit him with  my Mercury Aqua</p><p>Rhapsody. It looks like he would have been fine if  he hadn't hit his</p><p>head on the tree." Mercury said as she brushed some  hair out of Heero's</p><p>closed eyes.</p><p>"That sounds like something he would be grateful  for," Duo said as he</p><p>looked from Mercury K to Sailor Mercury, "but that  doesn't explain why</p><p>you would do it. I mean, you strike me as a very  gentle girl, not crazy</p><p>like Heero."</p><p>"He isn't crazy and I am gentler than the others,  but it was the only</p><p>way to get him to stop feeling so guilty. I mean,  he's been feeling</p><p>guilty about this for over a thousand years, that's  not the kind of</p><p>thing that just saying it's ok with take the guilt  away." Ami said</p><p>gently and Duo nodded in understanding.</p><p>As they had been talking, Hotaru had been healing  Heero. As they</p><p>finished speaking, Heero opened his eyes and sat up,  startling a bird</p><p>that had been hunting for seeds near him. As the  bird fluttered away,</p><p>Ami threw her arms around him from behind and  nuzzled the back of his</p><p>neck, surprising everyone present, including Hotaru  who had known her</p><p>the longest in this lifetime.</p><p>"I'm so glad that you're ok now." Ami murmured.</p><p>Heero didn't say anything, but he leaned back  slightly against Ami.</p><p>After a moment, they both shimmered, their uniforms  disappearing and</p><p>their regular clothes appearing in their place.</p><p>"I think we'll leave you two alone to finish your  talk." Hotaru said as</p><p>she dragged the grinning Duo back to the motorcycle  and crammed his</p><p>helmet back on his head before putting her own on.  Then in a cloud of</p><p>dust, the peeled out and shot down the path of the  park and out onto the</p><p>street, Hotaru waving madly at the couple they were  leaving behind.</p><p>As soon as the dust settled and the last echoes of  the engine died away,</p><p>Heero turned his head slightly and said, "Tell me  about what you</p><p>remember about our past lives."</p><p>"Ok. My earliest memory of you was a battle…</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Your Majesty! There has been an attack on an isolated  town near the</p><p>southern border of the country." A guard panted as  he rushed into the</p><p>throne room of the Mercurian royal palace where the  Queen, the Princess</p><p>and the Princess's protector were talking.</p><p>"Who has attacked them?" the queen demanded as she  stood up quickly.</p><p>"Yomas, Your majesty. A boarder patrol sent the  message just before they</p><p>were killed."</p><p>"You may leave now." The queen said grimly and the  man bowed out of the</p><p>room. Turning to the others she snapped, "We need  Sailor Mercury and</p><p>Mercury K to go to the town and stop the monsters  before they can kill</p><p>anyone else."</p><p>"Yes mother." Ami said while Odin nodded. In a  flash, Sailor Mercury and</p><p>Mercury K were standing in their places.</p><p>"I will transport you two to the place." The Queen  said as she pulled a</p><p>wand with a large blue crystal on top. Curling  around the crystal was a</p><p>dark blue wave with a teardrop dangling from the  tip. It sort of looked</p><p>like the moon wand with the exceptions being the  wave and teardrop in</p><p>place of the crescent moon and it being in shades of  blue instead of</p><p>pink and gold. It was Mercury's royal scepter and  worked the same way as</p><p>the Imperial Moon Wand the Queen Serenity had, just  weaker.</p><p>"Mercury Prism Power! Send these two to their  battle!" the Queen cried</p><p>as she held the scepter above her head. Bright blue  rays of light and</p><p>power shot from the crystal and surrounded the two  in front of her,</p><p>forming a bubble around them. In the blink of an  eye, Ami and Odin</p><p>disappeared from the throne room and reappeared fifty  miles away in the</p><p>center of a small town where they could see dozens  of monsters wandering</p><p>around, draining the energy from the few remaining  people. When Mercury</p><p>and Mercury K appeared, all activity ceased as the  monsters turned</p><p>towards them in surprise.</p><p>The moment of stillness was shattered as a cold  voice rang out from the</p><p>shadows. "Kill Sailor Mercury and Mercury Knight.  Queen Beryl will bless</p><p>which ever of you does it."</p><p>That was all that was needed for the yomas to attack  them. They attacked</p><p>in a large group, coming from all directions at  once. Mercury K drew his</p><p>sword as he prepared for them while Sailor Mercury  backed up until her</p><p>back was pressed against his. Summoning her power  she blanketed the area</p><p>in a fog that had recently gotten thicker with help  from her mother and</p><p>Odin.</p><p>While the monsters tried to find them in the fog,  Mercury K readied one</p><p>of his attacks. "Flasher!" he shouted as his  brightly glowing sword,</p><p>which was glowing a bluish slivery color, sent a  wave of energy at a</p><p>group of them that appeared through the fog. The  attack destroyed about</p><p>a third of the monsters, but the other two thirds  seemed to be smarter.</p><p>They started to use the fog to their own advantage,  hiding in the cover</p><p>of the fog and sending out wide ranged attacks that  didn't affect</p><p>anything with negapower.</p><p>Mercury was glanced by one of the attacks and  collapsed as her entire</p><p>left side was crippled from the blast. "Mercury! Are  you all right?"</p><p>Mercury K yelled over his shoulder as he ducked  under another blast.</p><p>"I can't move my left side and it feels as though  I'm bleeding heavily</p><p>as I am starting to get really light headed and  dizzy." Mercury said as</p><p>she blinked fuzzily around them at the thinning fog.</p><p>Before Mercury K could say anything, two bubbles,  like the one he and</p><p>Ami had arrived in, except this time garnet and  black, appeared and</p><p>settled to the ground on either side of them,  revealing four people, two</p><p>in sailor scouts uniform and two in the Knights  uniform.</p><p>"Hi there, Mercurys. Don't mind if we join the  party, do ya?" one of the</p><p>knights, wearing a black cape and a purple mask,  asked cockily as he</p><p>assumed a fighting stance next to Odin. On the other  side was a Knight</p><p>wearing a maroon mask and a matching cape.</p><p>"We saw what would happen if you received no help in  the fight and if</p><p>she received no medical attention so our queen  contacted Saturn's and</p><p>they sent us to help." He said calmly as he drew his  sword and prepared</p><p>to fight. The two new sailor scouts had hurried to  Mercury's side and</p><p>now the taller one with the long green hair and the  red eyes protected</p><p>he other two while the girl with the short black  hair healed Ami.</p><p>As soon as she was back on her tiny, blue boot clad  feet, Mercury threw</p><p>a thick fog over the area again as the other one had  dissipated. "Now</p><p>what do we do?" she asked as she looked at the new  comers.</p><p>"Now, we kick some yoma ass!" the one in black and  purple said as he</p><p>swung around as he caught sight of movement in the  fog. That was when</p><p>the two Mercurys caught sight of the long brown rope  of hair that</p><p>reached all the way to his knees.</p><p>"Saturn K, those were not our orders." The green  haired girl snapped as</p><p>she gripped her staff tighter. The yomas, whom had  been scared off a</p><p>little bit at the appearance of the others, were  starting to edge</p><p>towards them again.</p><p>"Ah, come on Pluto. We're going to have to fight  them sooner or later. I</p><p>would rather it be sooner." Saturn K said with a  quick grin at the</p><p>annoyed Sailor Pluto.</p><p>"That is enough." The girl with the black hair said  firmly as she</p><p>gripped her glaive tighter. "We need to find out who  is behind this and</p><p>then get out of here."</p><p>"Beryl is behind this." Mercury K said coldly as he  watched the circling</p><p>fiends.</p><p>"How do you know?" Pluto asked.</p><p>"Because the reward for killing us was a blessing  from Queen Beryl."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"Well, now that we have the information, I think we  should get out of</p><p>here." Pluto K said as the monsters started  tightening the circle.</p><p>"Good idea." Mercury said as she pulled out her communicator  and flipped</p><p>open the top. "Mother, we need to return to the  palace and there are</p><p>four extra people here that need transportation  too."</p><p>'I know dear. The Queens from their planets have  already contacted me</p><p>and I will transport the six of you in a moment.'  The voice of the queen</p><p>said from the communicator and Mercury nodded before  shutting it with a</p><p>quick snap.</p><p>Not three seconds after she had cut the connection.  Mercury and the</p><p>others were surrounded by a ball of blue energy and  whisked away from</p><p>the yomas just as they sprang. They reappeared in  the royal throne room,</p><p>Saturn K already grumbling that they were just  putting off the</p><p>inevitable.</p><p>"Sailor Pluto, Pluto K, and Sailor Saturn and Saturn  K. it is a pleasure</p><p>to finally meet you." the queen said as she  approached the four new</p><p>comers.</p><p>"Your majesty." They murmured together as they  curtsied and bowed</p><p>respectively.</p><p>After the pleasantries were through, Pluto spoke up  in a serious voice.</p><p>"Your Majesty, we found out that Beryl is behind the  attacks on the</p><p>kingdoms of the silver alliance."</p><p>"I have long suspected that she was the one behind  the attacks, but I</p><p>have had no proof." The queen said as she sat down  in a chair pulled up</p><p>to a table with eight others. She gestured for the others  to join her</p><p>there as a servant put a tray of drinks on the  table.</p><p>"Who are the other two chairs for?" Duo asked as he  picked up a goblet</p><p>of wine. Just as he was taking a sip, the door  opened.</p><p>"They are for us." A voice said from the doorway,  causing Duo to spit</p><p>out the wine all over the table in shock. "Hello  Duo."</p><p>"Nephrite." Duo snarled, springing to his feet  before turning his gaze</p><p>to the other man. If it was possible, Duo's gaze got  even darker. "And</p><p>you, Malachite. What the hell are you doing here?"</p><p>"Why, were here to help you plan the battle against  Queen Beryl, Little</p><p>Duo." Nephrite said with a smirk.</p><p>Turning hard eyes on the Queen, Duo snapped, "Is  this true?"</p><p>Bristling slightly at his manner, she said in a cold  voice, "It is true</p><p>that they are here to help us plan a strike against  Beryl. Now tell me,</p><p>Duo, what is the matter with you?"</p><p>"What's the matter with me? I tell you what's the  matter. The matter is</p><p>not only did you just invite two traitors into your  castle, they also</p><p>happen to be two of the people who made me into  Shinigami." Duo snarled</p><p>at the queen, who had a shocked expression on her  face.</p><p>"What? They are the ones who did that to you?"  Hotaru screamed into</p><p>the sudden silence after Duo's stunning statement.  It took Duo, Triton,</p><p>and Odin to hold her back as she tried to throw  herself at the two men</p><p>who were starting to edge towards the door, now  realizing that their</p><p>plan to gather information on the sailors and their  knights from the</p><p>inside, had failed.</p><p>Both men stopped at the door and started gathering  dark nega-energy into</p><p>balls in their hands while the others where still  trying to calm Hotaru</p><p>down. Odin looked up just in time to see the balls  leave their hands and</p><p>shoved Hotaru away into Duo and Triton who then  landed on Ami and</p><p>Sestuna.</p><p>Turning back to Nephrite and Malachite, he shouted  "Tsunami Crusher!" a</p><p>huge wave of water gushed out of his hands with  enough force to send the</p><p>men through the thick wall behind men and to the  opposite side of the</p><p>wide hall. When the dust and ruble had settled, both  of them were gone,</p><p>leaving only the ruins of the wall and the water all  over the floor.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"…and then not to long after that, everyone went to  the moon where right</p><p>before the party, Queen Beryl attacked." Ami said as  she leaned against</p><p>him slightly as she stared out at the water.</p><p>Flashback</p><p>Ami and Odin were in their guest rooms preparing for  the ball when their</p><p>communicators went off. Opening the tops, they  listened as Sailor Mars</p><p>sounded the order to transform.</p><p>"…the enemy has arrived at the palace gates and are  slaughtering the</p><p>guests waiting to enter the palace. If we don't  hurry, everyone is going</p><p>to die." Mars snapped angrily as she ran down the  hall of the palace</p><p>from her room. Her room had a view of the front  gates and had seen when</p><p>the massacre had begun.</p><p>"Well be right there." Mina said and the others  added their agreements.</p><p>Within three minutes, fifteen scouts and knights  were assembled and</p><p>ready to take on the monsters. In the moments before  the battle began,</p><p>Neptune K asked Saturn K quietly, "Where is Sailor  Saturn? Shouldn't she</p><p>be here?"</p><p>Just as quietly, Saturn K said, "There was some  trouble back on Saturn</p><p>and she needed to go take care of it. She should be  back soon, hopefully</p><p>after we take care of this annoyance. I promised to  dance with her all</p><p>night at the ball."</p><p>They couldn't say anymore after that as the battle  had begun.</p><p>Mercury and Mercury K quickly found themselves  separated from the others</p><p>as six large monsters singled them out and began to  drive them towards</p><p>the trees in the not to far distance with carefully  placed attacks.</p><p>"Odin, we need to do something! They're driving us  away from the others</p><p>and we won't last to long if they keep throwing  attacks like that at</p><p>us!" Ami shouted as they dodged an energy ball that  blew apart a huge</p><p>boulder.</p><p>"I know that Ami!" he shouted as he threw a Tsunami  Crusher at a few</p><p>that were getting to close. They fought valiantly as  they entered the</p><p>tree line, but Sailor Mercury was the weakest scout  and the yomas seemed</p><p>to know that as they focused more and more attacks  her way. finally, a</p><p>killing blow was struck, but not from the monsters,  but a man with wavy</p><p>gold hair that reached mid back. He approached  silently behind Ami as</p><p>she thickened the fog once again.</p><p>Without a word, he changed from a mouth wateringly  beautiful man to a</p><p>fiend. His incisors lengthened into long, deadly  fangs and his eyes</p><p>became more catlike with narrow, slit pupils. With a  glance, he sent the</p><p>yomas running from him and their original targets,  surprising Mercury</p><p>and Mercury K.</p><p>Odin turned to smile at Mercury only to freeze in  shock as he watched</p><p>the man prepare to grab Ami and sink his teeth into  her neck. Reacting</p><p>on impulse, he leapt forward and shoved Ami away,  slamming his fist into</p><p>the autocratic face.</p><p>"You vill pay for zat." That creature sneered in a  heavy French voice,</p><p>full of culture and expression.</p><p>"Don't you dare touch her." Mercury K snarled back.</p><p>"I vill touch who ever I  vant, whelp." The man snapped and bit his own</p><p>figure and formed a whip  out of the blood which he sent flying towards</p><p>the fighter from Mercury.  The whip struck him in the chest and sent him</p><p>stumbling backwards, a  long bloody gash that went from his left shoulder</p><p>to his right hip. During  the next few minutes while Ami was trying to</p><p>clear her head from when  it had hit the ground when Odin had pushed her,</p><p>Mercury K was severely whipped.</p><p>"Now, little whelp, it is  time I finished this and drink from your</p><p>little girlfriend." The  man said with a cruel grin as he approached and</p><p>as he walked, his whip  shimmered, shifted and became a red sword.</p><p>Ami looked up and saw the  man stalking Mercury K with a large sword and</p><p>reacted before she could  think. Just as the blonde man lifted his sword,</p><p>preparing to stab Odin in  the chest, she lunged forward and wrapped her</p><p>arms around his neck,  presenting her back to the man and his sword,</p><p>which rammed through her  back and then into Odin's chest.</p><p>"Vhat a pity. All zath  blood gone to vaist." The man sighed without</p><p>remorse and then turned  away, leaving the sword stuck in them both.</p><p>As the man walked away,  Ami and Odin stared into each others eyes as</p><p>their blood mingled where  their chests where pressed together.</p><p>"I…love…you…" he gasped  and she gave him a wistful smile.</p><p>"I…just wish…I had had  enough…guts to tell you the…same so long ago.</p><p>I've…loved you…ever  since…you came into…my library… and… we… talked…</p><p>about…what…we  were…interested…in." she said and pressed he lips against</p><p>his in their first and  last kiss of that life. And then they both passed</p><p>on to await their next  life.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>They were silent for a few  minutes after Ami had stopped her tale of</p><p>their deaths in their  previous lives, each contemplating on their last</p><p>actions. Finally, Heero  spoke up.</p><p>"Well, why don't we  continue where we left off?" he said and leaned</p><p>towards her and pressed  his lips against hers in a deep kiss.</p><p>TBC</p>
