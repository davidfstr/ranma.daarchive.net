</div>                Ranma ½: New Friends<p>Ranma ½: New Friends</p><p>Arrival of Jupiter, Mercury, and Pluto Knights</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>There was complete silence once Duo finished the climb of  the temple steps. Duo stared at his friends and family, and they just stared  right back until finally, Heero said in a monotone, "What the hell just  happened Duo?"</p><p>"Well, you see Heero, I remembered a promise to Hotaru that  I made as I was dieing on the Moon Kingdom. It was during the final battle  against Beryl and I had a sword through my chest." He started but was  interrupted before her could get any further by Lita who screamed, "What?"</p><p>"Calm down, Sis. I bet you didn't die peacefully there now  did you?" Duo asked and she reluctantly shook her head as memories of being  ripped apart by a yoma filled her mind. "Anyway, I had a sword through my chest  but it had only hit my lung so I was able to survive long enough for her to  find me. She tried to heal the wound but she was too weak from trying to get  there fast enough to help fight. So I ended up dead, but before I promised her  I would give her a huge, breath stealing welcome kiss as soon as we were both  awakened again." Duo said and the other pilots just stared at him in shock.  They couldn't believe that Duo would keep a promise for over a thousand years.</p><p>The scouts were to busy gushing on how "they wished that  they had some one who would do that for them," and Ranma and Ryoga had already  lost interest and had gone a few feet away to spar gently. Well all the scouts  were gushing except Mina who was quietly sneaking up on Quatre. Heero, Wufei  and Duo, who were facing the blonde pilot, saw her coming, but for reasons of  their own, didn't do anything except watch what was going to happen.</p><p>As soon as Mina was behind Quatre, she put a hand on his  shoulder, spun him around and kissed him as deeply as she could. Poor Quatre  was so startled that he almost fainted. After a moment, he got over his  surprise and started kissing Mina back. They were about the same height so it  was a good match and when they finally stopped, everyone one could see a  blissful smile on Mina's face and a self-assured, smug smile on Quatre's.</p><p>"And what was all of that about, Q-man?" Duo teased his  friend who blushed faintly with Mina doing the same after a moment.</p><p>"Well, you see Duo, on the day of the attack on the Moon  Kingdom, Mina and I had gotten engaged." Quatre said and that was as far as he  got as everyone, excluding Heero, Wufei, and Trowa, screamed "You did what?"</p><p>"Got engaged. It was to be announced at the party that night  but as you know, Beryl attacked." Mina said as she cuddled up to Quatre.</p><p>"Well, it's starting to get late. I think we should all go  home for now and meet back here tomorrow." Ranma said into the silence that  followed and the others nodded.</p><p>"But what about Duo and Lita?" Serena asked quietly as the  pilots turned to leave.</p><p>"I need to be near my Gundam in case of an emergency, but  you can sleep over tonight. There are plenty of rooms. Right Quatre?" Duo said  as he turned to the blond, only to find that he was busy kissing the other  blond again. "Quatre, hey Q-man! Are you listening?" Duo asked as he knocked on  the top of Quatre's head.</p><p>"What? Oh, sure she can sleep over tonight. She can use one  of my sister's rooms." Quatre said before turning back to Mina.</p><p>"Lita, before you go, do you think you can wake up my  memories?" Ranma asked Lita as she started to walk away.</p><p>"Sure. But lets go inside to do this." She said as she led  him in to the temple with others following. As soon as they were settled in  Rei's room again, Lita copied what Rei and Hotaru had done earlier. Within a  minute, there were both surrounded by a deep green aura that flickered as the  others watched. Finally, about ten minutes later, Ranma dropped to the ground  unconscious and Lita slumped over a little.</p><p>"Are you two all right?" Serena asked her friend as she went  over to help her sit up.</p><p>"Yes. It just took me by surprise how tired I would feel."  She said as she shook her head and stood up. "You should call you family to  come pick you up since it's 8:30 now, and you need to see if Ranma's friend  Ryoga can stay over as well." She said and Serena nodded before going to ask  Rei if she could use her phone.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence for Ranma to wake up and for  Serena to get back and both things happened at about the same time. Just as  Ranma was sitting up, Serena came back into the room with a big smile on her  face. "Dad will be here in about ten minutes and it's ok for Ryoga to stay with  us for a while too." She said as she helped Ranma stand up and led him over to  his wheel chair so he could sit down.</p><p>"That's great." Ranma said with a tired look on his face.</p><p>"Are you all right?" Serena asked worriedly and he nodded.</p><p>"It's just been a long day. I really need to get back in  shape." He added and Ryoga nodded from his place against the wall.</p><p>"You are at about 1/80 of your overall fitness from just  before your accident. You were stronger back when we first met." Ryoga said and  Ranma sighed.</p><p>"I know, but it's not like I became this way on purpose." He  said irritably.</p><p>"I know."</p><p>Sighing, Ranma then turned to Lita, who was watching him.  "Lita, if you are about as strong as you were in the Silver Millennium, then  you should train with us too. It's at twelve in the park, near the lake."</p><p>"Ok. I just wish that I had more memories of you. Right not,  I only have about three or four." She said quietly.</p><p>"You didn't get a full down load. When you get you powers in  battle, your memories come back slower. But if you are awakened by your partner,  you get almost all of them." Luna said from under the bed.</p><p>She and Artemis had been there most of the time but they  couldn't reveal themselves because of Ranma. But with Ranma on the opposite  side of the room, Luna thought that she could talk to them without coming out.</p><p>"Who said that?" Duo asked as he jumped off the bed.</p><p>"That was Luna and if I'm not mistaken, then Artemis is  under there too." Mina said from where she was sitting in Quatre's lap.</p><p>"The Royal advisers? Cool!" Duo exclaimed as he reached  under the bed and grabbed the two surprised cats. As soon as they were out,  they tried to run back under the bed but it was to late. Duo had a good hold of  them and there was no one between Ranma and Duo.</p><p>"C…c…cats!" Ranma screamed as he tried to scramble  away.  All he succeeded doing, though,  was over turning the chair and wedging him self in a corner. Everyone turned at  his scream and was shocked to see Ranma cowering in a corned with his hands  over his head. "Keep em' away! Keep em' away!" Ranma cried and suddenly Serena  remembered her cousin's fear of cats.</p><p>"Duo! You have to get the cats out of here!" she screamed at  the startled Duo.</p><p>"Why?" he asked as he looked back towards Ranma who had  stopped yelling and had gone completely stiff.</p><p>"If you don't get the cats out of here right now then Ranma  is…" she trailed off as Ranma suddenly let out a loud meow. Everyone turned to  look at him while Serena gave off a choked, "Oh no…"</p><p>"Everyone, stay completely still." Ryoga said harshly as he  took a small step forward, gaining Ranma-neko's attention, who growled at him  menacingly.</p><p>Luna and Artemis had used this sudden stillness of Duo to  slip out of his arms and out the window. Heero used the same stillness of the  room to whip out his gun and point it at Ranma-neko who now turned from Ryoga  to the new threat.</p><p>"NO!" Ami yelled as Ranma-neko jumped for Heero. Surprising  everyone, including herself, she jumped in front of Heero, just as Ranma  slashed with his ki claws.</p><p>"Ami!" Everyone yelled as she slumped down into the shocked  Heero's arms. She had four large gashes across her chest and it looked like  they were deep. With his arms around Ami, Heero couldn't bring his gun up in  enough time or dodge to avoid Ranma's next attack. Just as the ki claws were about  to land on them, a deep blue glow surrounded the pair. The light threw  Ranma-neko away from them with enough force that he slammed into the far wall.</p><p>As the glow faded, it revealed Heero in a knight uniform  like Quatre's, except he had a dark blue cape with a light blue mask. Just as  fast as the uniform appeared, it disappeared, leaving Heero back in his green  tank top and jeans. He slumped forward briefly before he stood up and walked  quickly over to the bed. As he laid Ami down, everyone noticed the gashes were  somehow gone, leaving only the tears in her shirt. All the guys politely turned  their backs until Heero covered her modestly with a blanket.</p><p>Ryoga and Serena, meanwhile, were trying to wake Ranma up.  "Ranma, can you hear me? Ranma?" she said as she gently patted his cheek.</p><p>"I know just the way to get him up." Ryoga said as he leaned  down and said loudly in Ranma's ear, "Ranma, if you don't wake up right now,  you are going it have to eat Akane's cooking for dinner."</p><p>"Keep it away!" Ranma screamed as he jumped up off the  floor. When everyone turned to look at him, he blushed and mumbled something  about toxic waist for food. As he looked around, he saw Ami on the bed and  rushed over as fast as he could. "Oh my god! What happened to her?"</p><p>"You did." Heero said coldly as he whipped out his gun and  leveled it at Ranma's forehead.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"You used the Neko-ken, Ranma." Ryoga said and Ranma's face  went white and he abruptly collapsed on the floor.</p><p>"No, not again…" he whispered as he buried his head in his  arms.</p><p>"What? What happened?" Serena asked as she dropped to the  floor next to her cousin and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>"A year after I was trained in the Neko-ken, just after my  seventh birthday, we came to this village. They had a lot of cats around and  the Neko-ken took over. When I woke up, three people had horrible slashes on  their chest and faces. They almost died and it was all my fault! Now the same  thing is happening again, this time to Ami."</p><p>Everything was silent for a moment as they stared in horror  at the huddled figure on the floor. Finally, Serena found her voice. "It was  not your fault Ranma. You can't control the Neko-ken and if it was anyone's  fault, it was Uncle Genma's because he was the one that threw you into that pit  of starving cats!"</p><p>"What! You dad threw you into a pit of starving cats?" Duo  exclaimed, looking pale himself. "Man, sorry I pulled the c…um Luna and Artemis  out from under the bed." He apologized and Ranma nodded in acknowledgement.  After a moment, Duo spoke up again. "Can you explain what exactly the Neko-ken  is?"</p><p>"I'll explain since I've seen it happen a lot." Ryoga said  quietly. "The Neko-ken is a martial art's technique that will give the fighter  increased speed, strength, plus you can shred cement and steel with their bare  fingers or the ki claws. But because of the training, if the trainee doesn't go  permanently feral, then they can only use the technique when their fear of cats  get to a certain point where they go insane and start acting like a cat. But  usually, if they are knocked out or they go to sleep, or a big enough shock,  like if he gets turned into a girl, happens, then he will snap back to being  Ranma. But he can't remember what happens when he goes cat."</p><p>"Ranma, I don't blame you. You shouldn't blame yourself."  Ami said as she sat up in the bed, surprising most of the people in the room.  Holding the blanket over herself to preserve her modesty, she turned a  brilliant smile on Ranma before turning to Rei. "Rei, can I please borrow some  clothes. I can't go home with my clothes slashed and blood stained."</p><p>"Sure. I just finished something you guys, anyway. Since all  of you said you liked the temple robes, I made each of you one in your colors  for when ever you come over to help. I guess you can use yours now, Ami." Rei  said as she went over to her closet an pulled out a large pile of clothes.  Going to the bed, she dropped them in a heap at the foot of the bed before she  started sorting through the clothes. Quickly she pulled out a dark blue pair of  skirt/pants and a light blue wrap top shirt. On the back was the symbol of  Mercury embroidered in dark blue thread.</p><p>After handing the clothes to Ami, she shooed the men out of  the room and started passing out the other outfits to the other girls. For Mina  it was orange bottoms with a yellow top with an orange symbol for Venus. Lita  got dark green with a light green top with a dark green Jupiter symbol on the  back. And Serena got a pink and white version of Rei's priestess robes with a  gold moon on the back. "I also made some for the outers and Rini in their  colors. Well, Rini's is just like Serena's." Rei said as she gestured to the  others in the closet.</p><p>"Why didn't you put the symbol of Mars on the back of  yours?" Serena asked.</p><p>"Because these are priestess robes. I can't go changing  them. Grandpa would kill me." Rei said with a sigh.</p><p>Not wanting Ami to feel weird being the only one in her new  outfit, the others also changed in to theirs. Three minutes after then guys had  left the room, the girls left it too wearing their new robes. Serena was  pushing the wheelchair with her so that Ranma could sit down before her dad got  there, which was a good thing because just as Ranma sat in the chair, Serena's  dad arrived at the top of the stairs.</p><p>"Are you three ready to go?" Ken called as he hurried up to  the group.</p><p>"Yes. Daddy, don't I look great?" Serena said happily as she  twirled around to show her dad her new clothes.</p><p>"Sure you do honey. And so do all you other girls too." He  said with a smile at the group of girls. Turning back to Ranma he said, "Well,  how are we going to get you to the bottom with the chair?"</p><p>"The same way we got him up here. I'll carry him if you and  Serena will carry the chair." Ryoga said as he stepped forward.</p><p>"Are you Ryoga?" Ken asked and Ryoga nodded before he bent  down and swung Ranma onto his back. After saying goodbye to everyone, the trio  turned and left the shrine with Ryoga carrying Ranma and his pack and Serena  and her father dragging the wheelchair between them.</p><p>After they were gone, Duo turned to his sister and asked,  "Why does Ranma have the wheelchair? He seems to be perfectly fine. A little  weak maybe but fine nonetheless."</p><p>"Well you see…" Lita quickly filled the pilots in about what  had happened to Ranma and at the end, all five of them were shocked.</p><p>"Wow, that's…wow." Duo said. For once, he couldn't find the  words that he needed to describe what he was feeling at the moment.</p><p>"Yeah. I know. Now, we should get going before it gets to  late." Lita said as she grabbed her clothes and headed towards the steps after  exchanging goodbyes with the others.</p><p>As soon as Lita and the Gundam pilots were gone, Rei turned  to Ami and Mina, the only ones left. "You two can stay here tonight because  it's so late or you can use my phone to call for a ride."</p><p>"Thank you, Rei. I accept." Ami said and Mina nodded. They  spent the rest of the night talking about their new protectors and other things  that popped into their heads, unaware that Chad was missing from the Shrine and  had been since he had gone looking for Hotaru.</p><p>Back at home, Serena and Ranma helped get Ryoga get settled  in Ranma's room on a spare cot. As soon as it was set up with clean sheets and  blankets, all three sat down.</p><p>"This is so weird. I mean the day before yesterday, I knew  that I was never going to be able to move normally or do anything with the art  again and I knew that I would not have someone to love me for who I am. But  know, I'm completely healed and I have someone who has loved me for a thousand  years." Ranma said softly as he drew his legs up to his chest.</p><p>"I know. For me it was I went to bed one night a crybaby  wimp and the next say I was a super heroine and an alien princess to boot. I  was put in charge of saving the world by fighting monsters when I had never  fought anything in my life besides Sammy. And then just a year later, I found  out that I married the Prince of Earth, had a little girl and was Neo-Queen  Serenity, the ruler of the entire Solar system in the 30th century,  not to mention I'm going to live for thousands of years. I mean, I'm 16 and I'm  going rule everything and I'm still going to look twenty-three when I'm over a  thousand!" Serena said and the other two looked at her in shock.</p><p>"Well, I woke up one day and figured out that my worst enemy  is my best friend. Nothing like the two of you but, hey, that's life I guess."  Ryoga said with a small chuckle.</p><p>"Well, I guess we should get to bed. Goodnight guys." Serena  said as she stood up and headed for the door.</p><p>"Hey Serena, would you like to train with us? I figure if  you're going to be Queen someday, you should learn the family style." Ranma  said with a small smile.</p><p>"I don't know. I don't think I'm going to be good enough and  besides, both of you are so much more advanced than I am." She said quietly.</p><p>"Hotaru is going to be doing it with us too so don't worry  about it. We start at noon in the park." Ranma said and Serena finally nodded  before she left to head towards her room.</p><p>Ranma and Ryoga turned off the lights and got into bed in  silence. Just before Ranma could doze off though, Ryoga asked quietly, "Do you  miss Nerima?"</p><p>"I miss the area and I miss some people, like Kasumi and  Ukyo, but Ukyo abandoned me just like everyone else did, except Kasumi. She's  the only one to stay by me the whole time. Now, goodnight, Ryoga." Ranma said,  the rolled over and went to sleep.</p><p>"Night Ranma." Ryoga said as he too drifted off.</p><p>As soon as the Gundam pilots got back to the safe house,  Trowa went to his room to check his laptop for any new missions. Though he  would never admit it, he was slightly jealous of the others. They were all  Knights and had someone to love, even though Heero and Wufei would never admit  it out loud.</p><p>'You have a new mission. Enter password.' Was waiting on his screen after he opened the  connection to the Doctor.</p><p><b>'Nanashi' </b>he entered without a moment pause.</p><p><b>'Password confirmed. Enter secondary password.'</b></p><p><b>'Shin-chan no baka'</b></p><p><b>'Secondary password approved.' </b>Quickly encoded  writing scrolled across the screen and just as fast, Trowa decoded and read it.</p><p><b>'Mission accepted. Terminate connection.' </b>He typed  and severed the connection as <b>'Good luck'</b> appeared.</p><p>Closing the lid of his laptop, he hurried downstairs where  the others were either getting something to eat or talking to Lita. "I'm going  on a solo mission." He announced and the others nodded and said goodbye in  their own ways. Within moments, he was in the cockpit of Heavyarms and was  heading for the mobile doll base he was ordered to destroy.</p><p>At the same time Trowa was heading for his fight, Sailor  Pluto was heading for one of her own. Through the time gates, she had seen a  yoma attack in America. Not wanting to bother Serena and the girls, she used  the time gate to get there and challenged the monster as it drained energy from  a small group of victims. It looked like a cross between a cat and a bird.</p><p>"Guarding the Gates of Time, I am Sailor Pluto. How dare you  attack people who are trying to relax under the full moon. I cannot forgive  you. In the name of Pluto, I shall punish you." She said as she pointed her  staff at the monster as it abandoned its victims and turned towards here. 'I'm  starting to sound as stupid as Sailor Moon. I think I need to get more rest.'  She though with a sweat drop that matched the one on the monsters forehead and  the people watching, though the ones on the people watching was because she was  still speaking in Japanese and they had no idea what she said, though it did  still sound stupid.</p><p>After a moment to recover its self, the monster flapped its  wings and shot, what looked like a fur ball, at the scout, who nimbly dodged.  Hearing a hissing sound, she turned quickly towards the fur ball and saw that  the outer covering had melted away to reveal ten miniature versions of the  yoma. They quickly started circling her and as they got fasted, they started to  glow with a black glow that built up until it was a wall between her and the  outside world.</p><p>Throwing a Dead Scream at the wall, it rebounded back to hit  her in the stomach. When she was able to look again, the wall had formed a dome  over her and the creatures had stopped running though they were still glowing.  But the light was getting brighter and she could since the energy that was  growing in them. Knowing they were about to explode and kill her, she started  attacking the dome, but this time, instead of deflecting the attacks, it  absorbed them. She couldn't even open a gate to the Time Gates.</p><p>'I really don't want to die like this.' She thought and  suddenly she started glowing a maroon light.</p><p>Trowa was in trouble. He had succeeded in destroying half  the base, but now, he was being swarmed by dozens of mobile dolls. 'I really  don't want to die like this.' He thought as he ran out of bullets and missiles.  Suddenly, he seemed to hear echo of his thought and he started glowing with a  dark maroon light. The light kept getting stronger and stronger until even his  Gundam was glowing. After about a minute of this, the light exploded outward,  wiping out the mobile dolls and the rest of the base, even as he turned into  energy and was rocketed around the world, his Gundam disappearing from around  him to be transported back to the hanger under the safe house they were  currently staying at.</p><p>He solidified just as the creatures were about to  explode.  "Dead Shout!" he yelled as  maroon energy shot from his hands to hit the dome. Unlike when Sailor Pluto had  tried from inside, it exploded at contact, destroying it in time for him to  jump into the ring of glowing creatures and jump out again dragging her with  him. The creatures detonated a moment later.</p><p>"Pluto Knight?" Sailor Pluto gasped as she got a good look  at her rescuer. His outfit was the same as the other Knights, except his cape  was maroon lined and he had a maroon mask that covered his eyes.</p><p>"Yes. Talk later. We have a monster to defeat first." He  said and she nodded. She readied her staff as he drew his sword for the  scabbard.</p><p>"Sword Barrage!" Pluto Knight shouted as hundreds of energy  swords flew from his sword at enemy that then exploded on contact.</p><p>"Dead Scream!" Sailor Pluto whispered as the bright purple  attack shot from her staff to hit the monster it the chest.</p><p>Their attacks destroyed the yoma as the small crowd cheered  and the energy went back into the victims. Seeing that Pluto knight was about  to collapse, Sailor Pluto opened a portal to the Time Gate and quickly dragged  him after her as she disappeared into it.</p><p>As they disappeared, a figure in the shadows, who had  watched everything, turned to go with a small dragon curled around their neck.</p><p>Hi! I'm sorry to rush through finding most of the Knights.  I'm going to wait a while before Neptune and Uranus Knights arrive. Thanks for  being so patient with me and my story!</p><p>Shinigami-chan</p>
