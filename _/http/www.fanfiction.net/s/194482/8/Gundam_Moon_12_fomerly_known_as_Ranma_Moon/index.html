</div>                Ranma ½: Arrival<p>Ranma ½: Arrival</p><p>Ukyo and Her Darling  Ranchan</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>"Trowa, what happened  to make you look older?" Duo asked and all motion stopped as everyone blinked  blinked at him and then turned to the older Trowa, who blushed.</p><p>"He's right! He looks  about as old as Zechs Marquee!" Quatre exclaimed and Duo started nodding  franticly. "Yes! Yes! Exactly!"</p><p>"I can explain it."  Sestuna said and she put her hand on Trowa's broad shoulder. "It's because of  the Time Gates. Because he can also control them, he has a special bond with  them and with me. We work better together when we are the same age so the Gates  made us the same age. If he had more experience with the Time Gates than I did,  I would have been turned into a sixteen year old instead of him being turned  into a twenty year old." She said and the others stared at them for a moment  before nodding.</p><p>"Well, that's ok, but  who are the kids? Mina asked as she turned to the five younger boys standing  off to one side.</p><p>"My name is Tai and  I'm the son of Mina and Quatre. I am also Chibi-Venus Knight. It is a pleasure  to meet you. If it is all right with you, I would prefer to call you Mina  instead of mother as you are closer to may age now." Tai said as he nervously  straightened his yellow T-shirt.</p><p>"Yeah, sure. What  ever." Mina said, a shell-shocked expression on her face. Quatre wasn't as  surprised after meeting Shin earlier and having suspicions from first seeing  Chibi-Venus K.</p><p>The next to step up  was a boy with black hair that was tied in a small pony tail and purple  eyes he was wearing black Chinese style pants with a red silk, long sleeved  Chinese style shirt over a white tank top, kind of like what Ranma was  currently wearing, but Ranma's shirt was sleeveless. "I'm Chang Matt, son to  Chang Wufei and Rei. I am also Chibi-Mars K." he said and Rei goggled at him in  shock. Wufei was just mentally evaluating him.</p><p>"Odin Yuy. It's a pleasure." This came from the boy with  messy short brown hair and deep blue eyes wearing black jeans with a blue tank  top and black sneakers. "I'm Chibi- Mercury K." he said grudgingly as Shin  elbowed him.</p><p>"H.! I'm Shin, or Duo Jr. Do not ever call me that. Like I  said earlier, my parents are Duo and Hotaru Maxwell. I'm Chibi-Saturn K." he  said cheerful. It wasn't a shock to Duo and Hotaru as they were already used to  the idea.</p><p>"I the oldest child of the Time Guardians, Sestuna and  Triton Bloom, who goes by Trowa Barton to avoid confusion. My name is Triton  and I'm Chibi-Pluto K." he said as he stepped forward and gave a small bow to  everyone. With his forest green hair that hung over one light brown eye, and  his tight blue jeans and black turtleneck with the brown soft skin boots, it  was very easy to believe.</p><p>Sestuna took a step forward after a moment of wrapped her  arms around her future son, surprising most of the people present. Sestuna  isn't a person that showed her emotions in public and now, here she was hugging  someone, almost crying, and Trowa, who usually, you could never read his  expression, was openly smiling as he, too, approached and wrapped his arms  around his little family.</p><p>Soon, the children were surrounded by their families, with  Ranma, Ryoga, Haruka, and Michiru, and Lita standing off to one side as they  watched.  After about ten minutes of everyone  getting to know everyone else, Serena spoke up.</p><p>"I know Rini can stay with me again, but where are you guys  going to stay? We already have Ranma and Ryoga staying with us, so I don't  think there will be enough room for anyone else."</p><p>"I can have two stay with me if they don't mind sharing a  room." Darien said and Serena smiled at him gratefully.</p><p>"Matt can stay at the shrine. He'll just have to do a few  chores for Grandpa." Rei said and her future son nodded in agreement.</p><p>"We have plenty of room at the safe house. The rest can stay  there with us, and the others can come over anytime." Quatre said with a bright  smile hat was echoed on Mina and Tai's faces.</p><p>"I'll stay at the safe house!" Shin shouted and Duo grinned  and Odin immediately said, "Then I will stay with his Majesty." The others  laughed at the eagerness Odin showed at getting away from the hyperactive Shin.</p><p>"I want to stay at the safe house as well." Tai said and  Triton nodded. With that taken care of, Sestuna cleared her throat to get everyone's  attention.</p><p>"I was meditating last night at the time gates, before the  monster attack in America, and I have some news for Haruka and Michiru." Once  she had the two outer scouts complete attention, she said, "Your Knights are  Treize Kushrenada and Zechs Marquee. It will be up to you two what you do about  this information." She said and left after saying good-bye to her new family.  Between one moment and the next, she disappeared.</p><p>Michiru and Haruka  left soon after that in Haruka's sports car. Serena, Rini, got a ride back to  Serena's house in Darien's car with him and Odin, who were going to Darien's  house afterwards, and Hotaru and Duo led the others back to the safe house to  get everyone settled, with Rei and Matt heading towards the Cherry Hill Temple.  Ranma and yoga decided to walk home, as there wasn't enough room in Darien's  car for both of them.</p><p>As they walked, Ranma and Ryoga talked about training and  the scouts and their surprise guests from the future. But they were about to  get another surprise guest. This time from Ranma's past.</p><p>Ukyo stepped off the train in Jubaan, her spirits high. With  her pack on her back and her giant spatula strapped to her pack, she asked a  tall girl with long green hair for directions. After getting them, she walked  off, leaving the girl staring after her in puzzlement.</p><p>'What would that girl have to do at Serena's house?' Sestuna  thought. She quickly opened a portal to the Time Gates, which she could do  without transforming, and slipped though. Calling up a window, she watched at  Ukyo walked determinedly towards the house, while at the same time Ranma and  Ryoga approached from the opposite direction.</p><p>Ranma had put his leg braces on and had started using his  crutches, the closer they got to the house, so that if anyone saw them, it  wouldn't look as strange. After all, he was supposed to be partially paralyzed  and he wasn't supposed to be able to walk with out the braces and crutches.</p><p>As they started up the walkway to the front door, with Ranma  grabbing Ryoga every once in a while to keep him on the right path, Ukyo turned  the corner and caught sight of the familiar pigtail.</p><p>"Ranchan!" she squealed as she dashed up the walkway. Ranma  turned at the familiar name just in time for her to tackle him onto his back in  a hug.</p><p>"Ukyo?" Ranma gasped as he tried to pry her arms from around  him so that he could sit up. There was a rock digging into his spine.</p><p>"It's so good to see you!" she said as she planted a kiss on  his mouth. It took her a minute to realize that her wasn't returning her kiss  and was in fact struggling to get away. "What's wrong darling?"</p><p>"What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong is you abandon me  when I needed you the most. Heh, everyone abandoned me except Kasumi. But now,  after all this time, you come here calling me Ranchan and darling!"</p><p>"What? I didn't abandon you, I went on a training journey  because it hurt to see you like that." She said and he snorted in disbelief.</p><p>"Yeah right. Now state what you want and go away." He said  coldly.</p><p>"Want? You're my fiancée."</p><p>"No I'm not. You broke it off and even if you didn't, we're  still not engaged."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"What I mean is that I'm no longer a Saotome. Your fiancé is  Genma's son and he no longer has one. Ranma is dead to the Saotomes. If you want  to get your honor back for Genma stealing you dowry, than go to him. I'm sure  his wife Nodoka would love to met you. After all, his problems are her  problems." Ranma said sarcastically. Turning away from the stunned girl, he  said, "Ryoga, can you give me a hand? I can't get up with these things on."</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Ryoga's voice knocked Ukyo out of her shock and she  scrambled to her feet. "But Ranchan! I'm your cute fiancée! You love me!" she  exclaimed as she scrambled to her feet.</p><p>"I may have loved you once, a long time ago, but you have  never loved me. To you, I was just a way to salvage your family's honor. I was  nothing but a possession to you and Shampoo and Akane. Not one of you loved me  and it is over now. I refuse to let you ruin my life again." Ranma snapped.</p><p>"Ruin your life? I never…" she started weakly, but he cut  her off before she could protest more.</p><p>"Yes you did. You never gave me a chance to just talk to you  or hang out with my old buddy Ucchan. Instead, you had to constantly remind me  that I was you fiancée and that I had to marry you. Then when you, Shampoo,  Akane, and Kodachi got into fights over me, I would end up being caught in the  middle of it. Well, I'm tired of it all and I'm glade I don't have any of you  for fiancées anymore. At least Lita likes me for who I am." He said and  immediately regretted it as Ukyo straightened abruptly with fire in her eyes.</p><p>"I knew it! You're seeing someone else already! Probably  another fiancée. She's tricked you into think that she loves you!" she exclaimed.</p><p>"No she didn't and she isn't my fiancée. She is just a  friend of Serena's that is training with Ryoga and me."</p><p>"Right. When I find this Lita she's dead!"</p><p>"Who the hell are you coming to my house and threatening my  friends?" a voice said from behind the enraged Ukyo, who spun around to face  the new person.</p><p>"Serena." Ranma said, relief clear in his voice, a fact not  missed by anyone who heard it.</p><p>"Serena? As in Lita's friend? You're just trying to take my  Ranchan a way from me. You're just trying to get him for yourself!" Ukyo  shouted as she whipped out a few mini spatulas to keep her busy while she  grabbed her bigger spatula off her bag.</p><p>Serena screamed as she saw the sharp cooking tools flying at  her and dodged to the side, but one of the spatulas sliced six inches off one  of her pigtails, but Serena hadn't noticed it yet as she was flat on her back  because she had tripped during her dodge. What caught her attention was the  absolute stillness from everyone around her, including Rini and the rest of the  family, who had come out to see what the screams were all about. Even Ukyo was  still as Ryoga had her wrapped in his arms so she couldn't move.</p><p>"Ouch…hey! What's going on?" she exclaimed when she saw  that everyone was starring at her.</p><p>"Ser..rena…your hair…" Ranma stuttered as he pointed at her.</p><p>"What? What about my…hair…" she trailed off as she ran her  hands down the length of her pigtails. When she came put short on her right  one, she hesitantly looked down to see the small pile of hair on the sidewalk.</p><p>Her family winced in sympathy as tears started to snake down  her face as she held up the shorted hair. "my pigtail…you cut off my pigtail  you bitch!" she screamed, drawing shocked stares from her family as it was a  well known fact that there was no swearing allowed and, even if it wasn't,  Serena never swore. It just wasn't in her nature.</p><p>As everyone's attention was on Serena, Ukyo took this  opportunity to throw her head back, smashing it into Ryoga's face, dazing him.  As he loosened his grip, she wrenched herself away from him and grabbed her big  spatula and started to swing it at the angry blond. Before she could finish her  first over head swing, designed to knock her out, Ranma jumped into the path  and blocked it with an up raised arm, shocking Ukyo to her bones.</p><p>"Ranma, what…" she started but he interrupted her.</p><p>"Leave her alone! Haven't you done enough already? I told  you before, leave me alone! Just go away." He said coldly as she stared at him.</p><p>"I…it's her isn't it? She brainwashed you into thinking that  you don't love me! Your dead!" she screamed as she dodged around Ranma and  swung at the blond. Just before it hit, a crescent moon appeared on Serena's  forehead and she started to glow with a silver glow that made it almost  impossible to look at her.</p><p>Without a word, a beam of the silver light shot out and  melted the spatula. As Ukyo stared at what remanded of her weapon, Serena  started towards the chef, a deadly look on her face. Before anyone could do  anything, she was in front of Ukyo. In the next few seconds, everyone's opinion  of Serena changed because, it was then that she drew back her fist and slammed  it into Ukyo's face. With one blow, Serena succeeded in doing something Shampoo  had never managed to do in the two years they were fighting. She knocked her  out with just one punch.</p><p>As Ukyo dropped like a ton of bricks, Serena's family and  Ryoga stared at the blond. None of them had ever seen her like this. She was  able and ready to stand up for her self and was able to stop an angry martial  artist with one blow. She had finally grown p and her family couldn't be  prouder, even Sammy was impressed. Rini was smiling while Ryoga and Ranma  stared at her with a new sense of admiration. For one had been able to knock  Ukyo out with one punch before. One mallet hit, yes, but never one punch.</p><p>Seeing the proud, but shocked, expressions on her parents'  faces, Ranma quickly said, "Serena, congratulations! You have just learned to  use you ki."</p><p>"Huh, ki?" Serena said as the sliver glow died down and the  moon symbol disappeared from her forehead. He parents repeated her question  right hater her.</p><p>"Yes. Ki is the energy in all living things. Very few people  can manifest a battle aura or even do an attack, like your daughter just did."  Ranma said with a smile.</p><p>"But that's impossible to do!" Ken protested, but Ranma just  shook his head.</p><p>"No, it's possible. In fact, Ryoga and I can do it." He said  and started glowing a bright green. After a moment of hesitation, Ryoga started  glowing a green and gold swirled color. Both noticed the changes from their  usual auras and made a mental note to talk about it later, after the others  were gone.</p><p>"Wow! Can you teach me how to do that too?" Sammy exclaimed  eagerly and Ranma said, "I'll try, but everyone can't do it. I very surprised  that Serena was able to do that because, usually the only people who are able  to do what she did are yoga masters, martial artist masters or other people who  are centered and have a lot of ki. Even most martial artists who are centered can't  do more than a very small aura and can't even begin to learn how to do an  attack." Ranma said as he and Ryoga dissipated their auras.</p><p>"I won't say that I understand this, but ok." Ken said and  was about to turn back to his daughter when suddenly Ranma collapsed.</p><p>"Ranma!" everyone shouted as they rushed to the fallen teen.  Turning him on to his back, Irene saw the huge cut on his arm that went almost  to the bone that was still dripping blood. Taking her apron, she wrapped it  tightly over the wound then ordered her husband to get the car. As everyone was  rushing towards the car to get Ranma to the hospital, Serena turned and saw  Ryoga was still standing next to the unconscious form of Ukyo.</p><p>"Ryoga? Are you coming?" she asked and he shook his head.</p><p>"No. I'll stay here and take care of her. I think I can get  into the house later without getting lost." He said reassuringly and she  nodded, throwing a quick smile at him before jumping into the car just before  it left.</p><p>Sighing, he sat down next to Ukyo to wait for her to wake  up. She started to stir a few minutes later and the first thing she saw when  she opened her eyes was Ryoga frowning down at her.</p><p>"What happened?" she groaned as she sat up, holding her  head.</p><p>"You were knocked out when Serena punched you in the face."  He said matter of factly.</p><p>"That…that bitch! I'll kill her for what she's done to  Ranchan!"</p><p>"You will do nothing except turn around and go back to  Nerima." Ryoga cut her off coldly.</p><p>"Why?" she snarled angrily.</p><p>"Because Ranma is going t hate you forever now. You and the  others have been making his life a living hell for the past three years, and I  admit that I did too, but we've settled our differences and are training  together now. But you just attacked his cousin, who he is currently living  with."</p><p><i>"Cousin?" </i> she exclaimed as she stared at him in shock, her anger forgotten.</p><p>"Yes, cousin. After he was disowned, and paralyzed, his Aunt  and Uncle let him move in with them until he can get out on his own. You just  don't understand, do you? Ranma Saotome is dead. The Ranma left is a weak,  depressed guy who everyone except a few people abandoned him, including your  self. Since he had been here and since I found him, he has changed for the  better. Here he has peace and quiet and people that care for him." Ryoga said  and thought, 'Peace and quiet? Right.'</p><p>"But I didn't abandon him!" Ukyo protested.</p><p>"Ok, you didn't abandon him. You just said that you were  going to stay away from him until he doesn't have to use his braces, crutches,  or wheelchair anymore, right? Well, incase you didn't notice, he is still  wearing his braces. The doctor said that he would never be able to walk without  them again." 'But that was before he was healed.' He thought as Ukyo looked at  him in shock.</p><p>"But, he needs me and besides, he loves me! Why shouldn't  I…" she started but he cut her off angrily.</p><p>"Haven't you been listening to him? He said he might have  loved you once, but you ruined it a long time ago. And listen to your self! All  you keep saying is that he loves you, but not once have you ever said that you  love him. I bet what happened was that after being away from him for a year,  you realized that you still wanted him, like a trophy or a object to be  displayed. You found that without him around, you didn't get as much attention  and decided the best thing to do was to bring him back. And when you found out  that he wasn't in the hospital by, I'm assuming Kasumi?" At her nod, he  continued. "You decided to go after him again. Right?"</p><p>Ukyo didn't say anything and Ryoga continued in a less harsh  voice as tears started leaking out of her eyes.</p><p>"He's happy here. For the first time in years, he is  surrounded by people who care for him not because anything besides what he is,  and he has found his soul mate I think in the form of a girl that understands  him better than you or anyone from Nerima ever could. Just go home and get on  with your life, and let him live his own. If you hadn't been so obsessed with  Ranma, you would have noticed the twenty guys who are in love with you back  there, if you haven't driven them off for good this time, like that guy that  dresses like a girl who works for you. He has loved you for the past three  years."</p><p>"But he's always going after all those other girls saying  they are the true love of his life." She said weakly and he shook his head.</p><p>"That is just one of his ways to see if you love him enough  to get jealous about them. But notice he always comes back to you and he never  goes back to them. He has put himself in danger to help you out of trouble and  I think that he is perfect for you, if you can get him to stop dressing like a  girl and mailboxes and signs and bushes and everything else." He said and she  looked at him blankly for a moment before standing up and grabbing her pack.  She left quietly, but he saw that she was deep in thought about what he had  said.</p><p>Sighing, he turned towards the house and carefully made his  way inside to the living room, being careful not to get lost. He had feeling  that they wouldn't see Ukyo for a long time, but he couldn't shake the feeling  that something bad was going to happen from something from Nerima in the near  future.</p><p>Duo and the others finally arrived at the safe house and Duo  immediately dragged Hotaru and Shin upstairs, leaving the others to do what  they wanted to. Once they reached the first landing that led to the second  floor, he said "Quatre and Trowa have their sets of rooms on this floor along  with a music room and another living room. There also rooms for ten of his  sisters."</p><p>At the next landing, he said, "Wu-man and Heero stay on this  floor. It has room for ten more sisters and ye another living room. There is  also another room in the basement that they use for training. I'll show you  guys later."</p><p>"Where do you sleep Duo? The next floor?" Hotaru asked as  they headed up the stairs again.</p><p>"Nah. That floor is for guests and the rest of Quatre's  sisters. I'm on the top floor." He said and showed them to the last landing.</p><p>"There are a lot of rooms up here. Does anyone else stay up  here too?" Shin asked as they started down the hall.</p><p>"Nope. It's just me. The rest of the rooms are basically  guestrooms. I changed on into a training room and another into a music room  where I can blast my music. Because I'm so high up, it doesn't bother the guys  that much." Duo said in a cheerful voice. The truth was that when they had  moved into this safe house, he had been 'assigned' the top floor. The others  hadn't wanted him around them as he didn't fit into their groups. Trowa and  Quatre had their quiet, music playing group and Heero and Wufei had their tough  as nails, mission and anti-weakness group. But Duo wasn't able to be like them.  He was too different.</p><p>Turning to Shin, he said, "You can pick any room on any  floor and we'll just move the stuff out of it and into one of these spare rooms  if it occupied by one of the sisters. And you can stay here when ever you want  to, Firefly."</p><p>"I like it up here. I stay in this room over here." Shin  said with a smile as he opened a door and tossed his bag on the bed before  rejoining his teenage parents.</p><p>"I'll take the room next to yours whenever I can stay over."  Hotaru said as she wrapped her arms around Duo who smiled and hugged her back.  They stayed like that until Shin rejoined them.</p><p>"So what kind of music do you have in this music room of  yours?" Shin asked after a moment of silence as a grin spread across his face.  An answering grin appeared on Duo's as he lead them towards a door three down  from the end of the hallway.</p><p>Opening the door, he led them into a spacious room there  were two couches and a table in one corner of the room. Across from them was a  huge entertainment system. There was a large screen TV with a DVD player  underneath, and beside it in another compartment was a huge stereo system with  kick-ass speakers on either side of the case. On the bookshelves that covered  one entire wall where thousands of CDs and tons of movies. There were lamps  placed all over the room and a large space in the center of the room if you  wanted to dance or something. Everything was also in shades of black and  purple.</p><p>"This is my music an entertainment room. It's not as good as  the one I used to have when I was in training, but it makes do." Duo said  happily as he looked around.</p><p>Shin and Hotaru were slightly surprised but the loved it on  sight. Shin wandered over to the music selection while Hotaru went over to a  small lamp to look at it up close.</p><p>"Oh my god, you have Stabbing Westward!" Shin exclaimed and  Hotaru asked who they were. "Just about my favorite oldies group. They have  this one song called Sleep on their Wither Blister Burn + Peel. It's my  favorite song! Can I put it on? I haven't heard it since my copy broke about  two years ago."</p><p>"Sure, and it's not oldies, the album only came out six  years ago. Older, I know, but not oldies." Duo protested as Shin danced over  the stereo and popped it into the CD player, hit number nine and pushed play.  As the song started, Shin and Duo shared a smile while Hotaru listened to her  first taste of music a la Maxwell style.</p><p>Downstairs, the others looked up as loud music started to  come through the ceiling. "Oh no, it was to much to hope for that he wouldn't  get another copy of this after his broke." Tai groaned as he recognized the  song.</p><p>"We have the same problem with Duo. We tried to get him to  stop blasting this CD but, then he just blasts one of the other CDs that he  has." Quatre said tiredly.</p><p>"It's has to be really loud this time for us to hear it from  the fifth floor." Trowa said quietly and the other Gundam pilots nodded as the  rest stared at them, shocked.</p><p>"Like father, like son, I guess." Heero said quietly and the  others could do nothing but nodded in agreement.</p>
