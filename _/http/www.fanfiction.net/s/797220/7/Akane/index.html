</div><p>Disclaimer: I sadly don't own Ranma or any of the characters. Rumiko Takahashi does. I'm only using  her awesome characters for fanfictional stories. So I repeat, Rumiko Takahashi is the Creator of Ranma  ½</p><p><i>'...'</i> indicates thoughts of the character</p><p>*...* will tell you when a flashback appears</p><p>Akane</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Ranma and Akane walked home together. There wasn't any problems at school to their surprise. No  questions, no suspicious glances or glares. It all went off well. They got home and Ranma immediately  went to the Dojo while Akane went to her room to do her homework.</p><p>Instead of working at her desk, she was laying down on her bed reading and writing. She was trying to  hurry through it, mainly because she wanted to try to spar with Ranma. <i>'Maybe he'll decide to take it  seriously.'</i> Her mind wondered to all the spars that she experienced with him. He would comply to her  wish but he never advanced on her. How was she suppose to get better if he wouldn't try to attack her?</p><p>She sighed, displeased that she hadn't been training lately. She ran almost every day but now it  decreased to two to three times a week. She needed to get back to work if she wanted to get better. If  she wanted to beat Ranma.</p><p>Akane looked down at her book. Ten minutes passed as she continued thinking. She slammed her book  shut and stood, frustration clouding her thoughts and emotions. She wanted to talk to Ranma but she  was afraid of anyone finding out about them. Yeah, she had thought about this many times already but  it was always in the way.</p><p>She headed toward her window to look out into their backyard. She noticed Ranma was there,  practicing his hitting technique on a padded pole. He wore his regular black slacks with a red tank top.  The sweat on his body glistened from the sunlight. She noticed he was really pushing himself to the  max. He threw three punches followed by a side kick.</p><p>Time seemed to slow down for her at that moment. He stood in defiance as though the pole would  attack him and his face was set in pure concentration. She noticed his chest heaving up and down but he  didn't move, staying as still as a statue. She then felt his energy. He must have been channeling his chi.  She had seen him doing this before as he would just stay in his ready position and concentrate for some  time. She never really knew how long he did it for because she never paid attention to the time. It was  just him. His godly form standing there before her. She shook her head. How could she deny herself of  him? Of course she made him angry but she should have never pushed him away so.. hard.</p><p>But she wasn't the only one! He also pushed not knowing his actions. He had hurt her just as badly  with his words, because they came from him. Because he said them enough for herself to believe in  them. But she should not blame it all on him. If she did not get so jealous of him...</p><p>She got distracted out of her thoughts when she did not feel his ki and Ranma dropped out of his stance  to look at someone on the porch. Genma stepped into view and she noticed Ranma started to argue with  him. This was different from all the other arguments though. He was truly upset.</p><p>"No, I don't want to GO!"</p><p>". . .Go?" She echoed the last word softly. She looked at Genma step up to Ranma and put a hand on  his shoulder. <i>'Where would they go now? Wait! Wasn't he going to leave somewhere?'</i> Akane gasped as  Ranma nodded and looked up at her window. She was startled for a moment but she saw how distressed  he was. He looked back to Genma and nodded again as his father walked away. She unconsciously  whispered his name and turned around. He was leaving. She knew she wouldn't care as much if it was a  few days ago but now...</p><p>Ranma continued to draw his power and concentrate. He did this enough to where if he needed, he  could draw more power from within and make himself stronger or faster. His mind was disrupted by his  old man calling his name. He dropped his stance to face him.</p><p>"Ranma, m'boy. We're going to be leaving on that trip tomorrow. So you should get ready now."</p><p>"What? Tomorrow?" Ranma was caught off guard. He didn't think they were going to leave for that  trip for a while. Now his father is telling him that they're leaving the next day.</p><p>"No, we have to leave later, like in a couple of weeks. Not now! We can't leave tomorrow!" Genma  shook his head, looking very calm.</p><p>"Ranma we are leaving tomorrow, no matter what you say. We must go and your school has been  notified. Your training is very important. And we are leaving so get washed up and pack."</p><p>"No, I don't want to GO!" Ranma was letting his anger get to him. He wasn't thinking rationally.  Mostly because he didn't want to leave Akane.</p><p>"Son, listen to yourself. You knew this trip was coming. You told me you wanted to go, to get away for  awhile. Now face it like a man! Don't start crying and whimpering, that is not what a man does. This is  for you and there will be intense training for the next week or two. I want no less than the best for my  son. You hear me Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and chose to say nothing more. He turned to look at Akane's window and was shocked  to see her standing there, but his expression didn't change. He didn't want to leave her now. When he  had agreed to the trip, he and Akane were in a major fight that had them angry at each other for a couple  of days. Now he was content. He enjoyed Akane's company even though she showed a little anger  toward him now and then, but he knew that he loved her. And no doubt, she loved him. He turned to  look back at his father and nodded again. He was going to have to tell her and he knew she wasn't going  to take this lightly. Genma turned around and walked back into the house.</p><p>Ranma turned back to the pole he was practicing on earlier and punched it hard, splintering it and  caused some wooden pieces to go astray. But he didn't notice the cracking sound it made or the way it  was bent from the impact of his angry fist.</p><p>He remembered yesterday that Akane brought up the subject of himself leaving and it caused her to be  on the verge of shedding more tears. That was one of the reasons why she confessed her love to him  that day. Nabiki must have misheard the conversation that he had with his father and thought that they  were going to live somewhere else. But he told Akane that it was only a trip, it wouldn't be that long. .  .he wouldn't let it be that long.</p><p>He sighed in defeat. He had to tell her but would she take it and drop it as quickly as she did before?  He knew that she was going to make this into a problem but he had to figure out how he was going to  bring it up to her.<i> 'Did she hear us from her window?' </i>He didn't know but he was going to tell her  nevertheless. He picked up his towel and draped it over his shoulders. Ranma wiped the sweat from his  brow and turned to take a bath.</p><p>Akane waited impatiently as Ranma took a bath. She couldn't believe that he didn't just come to her  first. She was dying to know what had him so upset. She sat in his room and waited on his futon. Her  hands played with his blanket. <i>'Geeze, how long does it take to shower?'</i> She stood and walked over to  his window. Dinner was probably going to start soon. She heard the door open and close quickly. She  looked at Ranma as he stood only in a towel and he didn't seem to notice her there. He must have been  in deep thought.</p><p>Ranma was still thinking about Akane. How she would react? How he would handle being away from  her for more than a week? He pulled open his drawer and withdrew a pair of boxers and let his towel  drop. He heard a gasp and turned quickly to see Akane staring at him. Her hands were covering her  mouth and her eyes were wide, but still on him.</p><p>"Akane!" She looked up at him as her face was already as red as it can be. He could feel a blush come  upon his face and quickly put the boxers in front of himself.</p><p>"Ranma, I-"</p><p>"J.. just turn around for a moment." She quickly spun around as he hurriedly put his boxers on and he  grabbed his pants. He slipped into them and told Akane that it was okay to look. She did but slowly,  still embarrassed.</p><p>"Ranma, I'm sorry. I didn't, I thought you would've been dressed." She held her hand in front of herself  as she looked at him. He still didn't have a shirt on and he was tying his pants. Ranma smile sheepishly  as he looked up at her.</p><p>"I forgot to get clean clothes to change into. I didn't see you, sorry." She shook her head as he put a  white tank top on and buttoned up a black, sleeveless Chinese shirt.</p><p>"It wasn't your fault. I should have waited in my room." Ranma approached her but then backed away.  He looked around and noticed a tape recorder in the corner. <i>'Damn Nabiki.'</i> He looked at Akane and put  his finger to his lips, telling her to be quiet. He opened his window and picked her up smaller frame to  jump up on the roof. He set Akane down as she straightened out her white shirt and looked at Ranma  settle down. She sat next to him.</p><p>"You know Akane, it's actually been calm the past few days. It almost seems... nice, peaceful sort of."  She smiled and looked up at the setting sun. "I really enjoyed the last day we had.. together." Akane  looked at him and took hold of his hand. He squeezed it tighter as he continued and looked in the sky.</p><p>Ranma didn't want to say it. He could take a whole different direction with this conversation and make  her happy. He knew that was not going to happen and wanted to prepare her.</p><p>"Remember what you told me yesterday, about the training trip?" Akane's head jerked to her fiancé.</p><p>"What's wrong, Ranma?" He sighed.</p><p>"Pop wants to go and plans on leaving tomorrow morning." She squeezed his hand tighter in shock.</p><p>"What? Is that what you were talking about to your father? Why you... got upset?" Ranma looked at  her. His lips pressed together, frowning slightly.</p><p>"Yea. I didn't wanna go. This could have been avoided but I was being stupid when I made the decision  to go."</p><p>"Decision?" Akane questioned. He nodded.</p><p>"When we had a fight awhile back and it was pretty bad. We were angry at each other for a few days.  Pop came up to me suggesting to go on a trip. I, of course, agreed all to soon because I didn't want to  deal with fighting and getting pummeled with your hammer." Akane flinched at the last part.</p><p>"Sorry." She said softly.</p><p>"I deserved it sometimes. I really said some mean stuff to you because I didn't want to admit that, uh..."  Akane looked at him. He still held her hand but he was acting a little shy and embarrassed.</p><p>"Ranma, you can tell me. Don't worry." She turned toward him, never letting his hand go and gently  caressed his left cheek. He looked into her eyes and she smiled, encouraging him to go on.</p><p>Ranma did not think she could look anymore beautiful at that moment. The sun setting in the  background as she was looking at him with the gorgeous colors from the sky, accenting her delicate  features.</p><p>"Sorry, this is just so.. new, ya know? I didn't want to admit to myself that I liked you, cared for you. I  didn't want anyone knowing."</p><p>"Well, we still don't want people knowing but we know that we do now." Ranma took her other hand  in his and intertwined their fingers, playing slightly. She did the same.</p><p>"I'm glad that I know now." He said gently. "I'm sorry that I have to go. It should only be about a week,  week in a half maybe." She sighed and stopped playing with his fingers. Ranma looked down at her sad  eyes. He didn't want to be away from her but there was nothing he could do. And what would happen if  Shampoo decided to do something to her? He didn't want to start thinking about things like that now.  Ranma tried to pull her into a hug but his legs stopped him from doing so. He opened his legs and  pulled her to him as she wrapped her arms around his torso. She swung her legs to rest on his left thigh  and Ranma covered her with his arms, his being.</p><p>"Ranma..." She whispered. "You should already know how I feel and there's nothing else you can do or  say, but.. I don't want you to go. Don't you think that a week in a half is kinda long? What about  school? You're going to have to catch up on so much." Ranma buried his face in her hair. He took in a  deep breath of her sweet, refreshing scent. He loved the way she smelled.</p><p>"It seems as though everything is happening so fast...yet .. I don't know." She felt his lips brush her  forehead. Akane lifted her head to look into those wonderful azure eyes. They were so gentle as they  looked at her with warmth, with love.</p><p>She grinned evilly and looked away. "I think I can live without you. I don't need you around." She  couldn't hold in her giggling as Ranma looked at her shocked for a moment. He smiled.</p><p>"Oh really?"</p><p>"Yes, really. I don't think I need you." He smirked and poked at her side. Akane yelped and Ranma  advanced on her. She began laughing, trying to push him away. He pulled her closer as she squirmed in  his arms and laid delicate kisses along her shoulder. She snuggled in closer and re-wrapped her arms  around his waist. She moved her head to the side to give him better access to her neck. Ranma took the  invitation immediately as he began to nip at her sweet tasting skin. She moaned at pleasure he was  giving as he kiss his way up her neck to her ear. He rounded his way along her jaw and she moved to  capture his lips. Her hands kneaded his back rhythmically, gaining a small moan from him as they  continued their passionate kiss while the sun slowly disappeared in the horizon.</p>
