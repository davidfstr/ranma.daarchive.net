</div><p>Disclaimer: I sadly don't own Ranma or any of the characters. Rumiko Takahashi does. I'm only using  her awesome characters for fanfictional stories. So I repeat, Rumiko Takahashi is the Creator of Ranma  ½</p><p><i>'...'</i> indicates thoughts of the character</p><p>*...* will tell you when a flashback appears</p><p>Akane</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>This wasn't the first time that he got lost. It was a joke to even say that because it wasn't anything  different, except the places he's been to. Of course, he could tell of all the different adventures he has  been on, all the unusual places and unique people that he's met too. Not all the places were good,  neither some of the people, but most were hospitable and polite to him.</p><p>He knew that he would eventually find his way back to the Tendo Dojo, but for now he would do a  little sight seeing. Who knows, he might come across something familiar...</p><p>This town had a nice park with a big fountain and a little playground off to the side. He noticed the  children were all laughing and having the time of their lives. By the benches, the mother's were  chatting. The children took advantage of their freedom and let their parent's forget about the time.</p><p>A ball hit his foot and a little boy with light brown hair and big blue eyes came up to him and asked for  the ball politely. He gladly bent down to picked up the red ball and tossed it to him. The little boy  bowed out of respect and ran to his friends saying that they could continue playing.</p><p>He smiled as he looked up into the sky. It was a beautiful evening and he wished that today would be  the day that he would make it to the dojo.</p><p>But he wished for that every day and never did want to leave in the first place, but that's what faith held  for him.</p><p><i>'Hmp! Or my cursed sense of direction!'</i></p><p>Ranma awoke early. Before he left, he wanted to spend some time with his beautiful fiancé. He  remember the peaceful time he had with Akane on the roof last night. Somehow, he found it difficult to  try to keep away from her. All he wanted to do was shower her with warm, delicate kisses and to tell  her that he loved her.</p><p>He bathed and dressed in his usual getup. Akane should have been getting up soon. It was nearing six  in the morning. It just so happens that when she leaves, he'll be leaving on his trip with his father as  well. He approached her door and lightly knocked.</p><p>He did not hear any responses from Akane, so he slowly opened her door to find Akane beneath her  comforter. As he neared the bed, he noticed she was hugging a pillow close to her body. His lips curled  into smiled as he thought about the morning before. If he slept with her again, he would be the one  wrapped in those arms.</p><p>He silently strolled to her and gently eased the pillow out of her arms. She moaned and he sat down on  the bed, replacing the pillow with himself. After thinking about being in her arms, he wanted to feel the  warmth of her body too. It gave him a sense of relaxation.</p><p>She unconsciously pulled him tighter and whispered his name and he ran his hand lovingly over her  cheek and through her disheveled hair. She opened her eyes and gasped his name in surprise.</p><p>"Ranma! What are you doing here?" He smiled and continued playing with her hair.</p><p>"Well that's a nice good morning to you too." She smirked as she tried to rub the sleep from her eyes.</p><p>"It's not every day that I wake up to you, you know."</p><p>"Oh! Am I that hideous to look at? I guess I not waking up material. All right, I know when I'm not  wanted." She chuckled softly as he attempted to leave but she immediately grabbed his shirt and pulled  him back to her.</p><p>"I didn't say that you <i>weren't </i>waking up material. I woke up just fine." She gave him a little peck on his  cheek.</p><p>"You know that I have to go today. I just wanted to feel you in my arms before I left. You do still have  more time to sleep." He offered noticing that she still had some time before she actually got up for  school. She drew him in closer and rested her head on his chest.</p><p>"I would think that you had enough of me last night." Ranma smiled as her arms tightened around his  waist.</p><p>"It seems as though your body isn't complainin' about me being here." He felt her cold hands slip  beneath his shirt, touching the small of his back. Ranma's hips jerked forward.</p><p>"Gah! Akane! Your hands are cold!" She grinned as she slowly brought her hands to his chest, leaving  an ice trail on his warm skin.</p><p>"Then your just going to have to warm them up." She purred seductively. Ranma smiled and pulled her  into him, dipping his head to nibble on her neck. She moaned in response but then slowly lowered her  head, cutting him off.</p><p>"What's wrong?" She looked at him sadly.</p><p>"It's not fair. I just get you and now your leaving. It's just not fair!" Ranma sighed and took hold of her  hand resting against his chest.</p><p>"Don't worry. After the trip, I'll be here permanently, with you." She smiled.</p><p>"You better be." She intertwined her fingers with his and he move down to capture her lips in a  sensuously, sweet, passionate kiss.</p><p>"I will." He murmured against her slightly parted lips. She giggled and pulled him back to continue  their passion.</p><p>Nabiki awoke with a start. Her breathing was hitched up and her heart wouldn't stop trying to leave her  chest.</p><p>She couldn't believe that she had a dream like <i>that!</i> She looked around and noticed her blanket was  shoved off of the bed. She ran a hand through her mussed hair.</p><p><i>'Kuno is plaguing my mind!'</i> The dream wasn't bad but... she dreamt that she was going to give herself  to.. to <b><i>Kuno!</i></b> What was she thinking? She needed time away from him.</p><p>She looked around noticing that her alarm was going to go off any second. All she had to do was not  think about him or hang around him during school. Her eyes closed as she began to clear her thoughts.</p><p>An image stood out from the darkness in her mind. A tall, handsome figure began to emerge as the  blurry picture becoming clearer... The thoughts all came flooding back.</p><p>How could she start thinking about him like that? She only thought about him for money but not...</p><p>Nabiki stood and hit the alarm as it went off. She needed to get ready for school. Today was also the  day that Ranma and his father were going to leave for their training trip.</p><p>She opened her door and caught a glimpse of Ranma leaving Akane's room. She blinked.</p><p><i>'What was Ranma doing in Akane's room at this hour? So early?'</i> She walked down to her sisters room  and looked down the hall. Ranma was nowhere in sight. She opened her sister's door to find Akane  slowly getting out of bed.</p><p>"So sis, what did Ranma want?" Akane's head jerked up. The question startled her but more so, the  voice behind it. Akane didn't know what to say. Did Nabiki finally catch them? She noticed Nabiki's  wild hair and rustled clothes.</p><p>"Are you okay, Nabiki?" She crossed her arms.</p><p>"I'm fine. What happened with your <i>Fiancee</i>?" Akane hesitated, quickly searching her mind for an  answer.</p><p>"Nothing. He was just being the usual pain that he is." Nabiki nodded, not catching on to the delay.</p><p>"Well you're going to love the next couple of weeks, huh?" Akane stared at her sister.</p><p>"Why?" Nabiki leaned against the wall and smiled.</p><p>"Well because Saotome isn't going to be here to aggravate you. You're going to be <i>Ranma-free</i>."</p><p>Akane smiled but deep down she was crushed. <i>'He only said a week and a half, no longer.'</i></p><p>"I have to get ready for school. I suggest you do too." Nabiki left a even more saddened Akane.</p><p>Though Nabiki didn't take notice and headed down stairs and went directly into the bath. There was to  many things going on right now and she needed to clear her head of any thoughts and relax.</p><p>Akane got dressed and proceeded down stairs to eat breakfast. She found everyone there except Nabiki.  She took her usual spot next to Ranma and picked up her bowl full of rice.</p><p>Ranma took a glance at Akane not seeing the usual fire in her eyes. He wanted to put his arms around  her and give her all the comfort that he could give, but then it would cause a stir within the family and  they'd be married before they knew it.</p><p>He looked over at his father. The whole reason why he was leaving was because he was suppose to be  getting away from Akane. Of course, Genma thought that it would be better for them to spend some  time away from each other so they wouldn't do something that they didn't want to regret in the future;  speaking through his terms.</p><p>Ranma continue to eat as Genma glanced at his son every few seconds. He noticed the soft look in his  eyes and wondered what it could be. <i>'Could they have all ready found love between them?'</i> He shook  his head. <i>'No. They just want to cool off and not have a fight right now. They both seemed very tired  yesterday and there were no arguments for the past day or so. Could it be their not talking because of  that horrid fight they had a while ago? Did it come back up as an other argument?'</i></p><p>"What's wrong Ranma?" Ranma looked at his father.</p><p>"What?" Genma sighed.</p><p>"You're never so quiet at the table, m'boy. And you, Akane. What did Ranma do to you to get you so  upset last night?"</p><p>"I didn't do nothing to her!" Ranma shot angrily at his father.</p><p>"I wasn't talking to you, boy!" Genma retorted. Soun looked over at his youngest daughter.</p><p>"Akane? Is everything alright?" She looked over at him then at Genma.</p><p>"Everything is <i>fine</i>. Why do you always have to meddle in my business?" She huffed angrily.</p><p>"Ranma! Apologize to your fiancee this instant!" Genma demanded, trying to take control of the  situation. Ranma looked over to Akane and she did in return.</p><p>"I'm sorry Akane." Ranma stared into her eyes. She knew he wasn't apologizing for whatever their  parents thought went wrong between them. She recognized that look on his face from last night. He  said the same words at the same pace with the same sincerest tone. She wanted to smile and give him a  hug but her parents were right there and they new they could do none of that.</p><p>She didn't know what to do though. If she accepts, would they think something went on between them  or should she storm out of the room. The latter would hurt too much but it would probably be  something that she would've done before.</p><p>"You're<i> sorry!</i> Yeah, you just needed our fathers to push you into apologizing and you think that you  could just get away from it like that?" She yelled at Ranma and stood quickly, pointing to her father and  Genma."If you two would just leave us alone, I'm sure things would work out, but you always have to  try to stick us into unwanted weddings! Maybe if you just let us be, some how we might end up  together."</p><p>She found herself saying things that she hadn't meant to say. The emotion was just welling up inside of  her, causing her to act without thinking.</p><p>"But that probably wouldn't work either because there are still three other girls still after him. So how  am I suppose to have a chance when they're all better than me?" They were all speechless, especially  Ranma. He knew some of that stuff was just show but he couldn't help but think that she meant a lot of  the things that she said.</p><p><i>'Akane...'</i></p><p>She rushed out of the room and headed up stairs. Ranma glared at Mr. Tendo and his father. She was  right about them butting in but they also are doing this on good intentions... well it's also considered a  selfish reason too but,</p><p>Ranma stood and walked out. He needed to talk to Akane before he left. Nabiki stepped out in front of  him before he could go up the stairs though.</p><p>"Saotome. What do you have to say to yourself now? You made my younger sister cry again. If you  continue this, I'm not going to be so nice to you in the future."</p><p>"I didn't do anything. Damn it! Why can't you people just mind you own damn business!" He rushed  passed her and up the stairs and straight into Akane's room.</p><p>He noticed her looking out her window and shut the door quietly.</p><p>"Akane." He said softly. She turned around and looked at him as upset as she was down stairs.</p><p>"Ranma. I didn't mean what I said down there. It was just for show." She tried to calm herself and  brought her tone down to almost a whisper.</p><p>He shook his head. He knew that wasn't true and saw through her words.</p><p>"I don't think that all that was un-true. Do you?" She looked away from him as he walked up to her.  "Do you think that after everything I told you, I would just go to Shampoo or Ukyo?" She looked at him  and shook her head.</p><p>"But how can I not feel that way?" Her eyes began to glisten with tears. "There's still a chance that  they'll try things to get you for themselves." Ranma grabbed her shoulders and pulled her body into his.  She gasped surprised by his sudden action.</p><p>"Ranma-"</p><p>"Believe me Akane, you're the only one that I want. Not my best friend, not an amazon that I beat, or a  gymnast that's obsessed with me..." Akane felt a shiver run through Ranma at the mention of Kudachi.  She smiled. Here he was trying to comfort her and tell her that he was only hers and forever.</p><p>"You don't have to say anything more, Ranma. I was just being emotional." He smiled warmly.</p><p>"Yeah, but that just tells me that you care." She wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him  down.</p><p>"I do care, I always have." He lowered himself more to kiss her evenly on her velvety lips and Ranma  smiled against her.</p><p>"I always will care about you." She was about to completely melt in his arms when Soun called up to  Akane.</p><p>"Akane! School's going to start soon. You should get ready to leave."</p><p>She sighed, displeased that this was going to be that last moment between them for a while.</p><p>"It's okay. I'll see you-" He was cute off by Akane forcing herself on him. Her lips pressed bruisingly  against his own. The force knocked his body against the wall. It didn't take him long to kiss her back as  he locked his arms around her slender body, pulling her tighter against himself. The intensity of the kiss  grew greater as Ranma hungrily ran his tongue over her lips. Her lips separated and sought him out and,  as their lust grew, their tongues continued their fiery duel, savoring the sweet and delicious taste of one  another.</p><p>After several moments, they pulled apart feeling the passion they expressed in the kiss surging through  their bodies. The fervent kiss left them breathless as they panted against each other, trying to calm their  rapidly beating hearts.</p><p>Akane let out a pleasureful moan as Ranma ran his strong hands over her back. She knew what would  happen if she stayed in his arms any longer. Feeling his fervor and desire radiate from his body wasn't  going to help her make her decision to leave his comfort, and knowing that she was going to be  deprived of it, only made her want to stay longer.</p><p>"I just needed something to remember you by." She smiled, still a little winded.</p><p>"Maybe I should leave more often." Ranma softly replied as his hands wandered her back, caressing the  fabric gently. She felt his trails leave her body tingling and wanting more.</p><p>"Then you'd just be getting more than you bargain for." He smiled and stole another sweet kiss from  her before someone called her name again. "I guess this is where we part." He nodded disappointedly.</p><p>Akane had to take in a few breaths to calm herself. She still felt unusually hot. "No longer than two  weeks. Any longer and you bet I'll come looking for you or you better use the moves you learned from  you father and get away." She pulled out of his arms.</p><p>Ranma sighed unhappily, feeling her intoxicating warmth leave his body. He continued to look at his  slightly flushed fiancé as she walked to her door. "Bye Ranma."</p><p>"Good bye my love." Her blush returned but smiled lovingly at Ranma before she left him in her room  alone. He would not let the trip last any longer, not if he wanted to leave a gorgeous woman here alone.</p><p>Akane went down stairs and greeted Nabiki who waited for her impatiently.</p><p>"Geeze Akane. If I'm late because of you I'm going to be very angry." Akane looked up the stairs to see  Ranma coming down.</p><p>"Hey, Akane. Make sure you get me the notes from class n' stuff, okay?" She nodded and he waved as  he left the room. She would do anything for him. Nabiki and Akane left for school and Ranma and  Genma geared up to go on their little trip.</p><p>As they neared the school. Nabiki kept looking down to her watch. It was almost time for the bell to  ring. Maybe she should have let Akane walk to school alone. She let one thing slip out of her mind and  everything comes crashing down. Kuno was going to be waiting for Akane. Well, she could just lag  behind and slip by while her little sister did the distracting for her.</p><p>She smiled to herself for coming up with such a great plan. Now she just had to keep away from him  the rest of the day though.</p><p>Akane did not mind Nabiki's company, but it just wasn't Ranma's. The way he walked on the fence or  cracked the most stupidest jokes. Yeah, that was him all right. But yesterday, he jumped on the fencing  and looked at her. He got an almost goofy, yet, shy grin on his face and jumped back down by her side.  He was chancing getting caught but there was no one around. He took hold of her hand and they just  walked silently to school.</p><p>Thinking about that led her thoughts to this morning and the wonderful kiss that they shared a little  while ago. Just thinking about it made her feel all giddy inside. She knows that he loves her and that he  wants her and just that thought alone, filled her heart with pure happiness.</p><p>As they neared the school, Akane was shocked only to see one person standing outside. She squinched  her eyes to try to get a better view of the person. Of course she had a thought of who it could be...</p><p>"Kuno?"</p><p>Nabiki jumped at the name. Good thing Akane was still looking at that him. She slowed her pace and  was now walking behind Akane. "Why can't there be a day that I don't deal with him? But why is it just  him?" Nabiki suddenly felt her plan crash to the ground. If there weren't any other boys other there, she  couldn't hide or get away. She did not want to stick around as they neared the front gate. Hopefully,  Kuno would rush to Akane and she could slip by without encountering him. She now, was lagging quite  a distance behind.</p><p>Kuno was starting to approach them. Nabiki needed him to stay where he was. Why was she freaking  out anyway? He was not going to do anything to her. He was out here to greet Akane.</p><p>"Akane, Nabiki." Akane turned to find her sister going off to the side.</p><p>"Nabiki? Where are you going?" Nabiki stopped and looked at Kuno. What the hell was wrong with  her?</p><p>"Sorry, Akane. Had to stop because I dropped my bag." Akane nodded and looked back at Kuno.</p><p>"Hey, we're going to be really late if we stay any longer." Kuno nodded.</p><p>"Yes. I do not want you to be late, Akane. But I was curious as to where Saotome was." Akane walked  by him.</p><p>"He went on a trip with his dad. Won't be here for awhile." She responded as if it was nothing new.</p><p>Kuno looked at Akane's retreating back. <i>'Saotome left Akane. She is freed from his confinements. Now  she could know who really loves...'</i></p><p>Nabiki walked by him without saying a word. Her head was lowered and she quickened her pace  towards the school. That was not the way she walked. Nabiki held self-respect and sauntered with pride.  She would never let people know of how she felt through her body language or facial features. He could  clearly see now that something was amiss.</p><p>"Nabiki? Is there-" She did not stop or turn around.</p><p>"We're going to be late." She hurried off into the school and he heard the bell ring. He would find out  what was the matter.</p>
