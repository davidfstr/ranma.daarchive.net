</div><p>Disclaimer: I sadly don't own Ranma or any of the characters. Rumiko Takahashi does. I'm only using  her awesome characters for fanfictional stories. So I repeat, Rumiko Takahashi is the Creator of Ranma  ½</p><p><i>'...'</i> indicates thoughts of the character</p><p>*...* will tell you when a flashback appears</p><p>Akane</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Akane jerked around in her bed as her blue comforter was kicked and tangled about her legs. Her  breathing became ragged and she began thrashing her arms as if she were running away from something  or someone. Cold sweat slid off of her forehead, soaking her pillow beneath her. Her eyes opened wide  as her body jolted forward. A small yelp escaped her throat. Akane's small, delicate hand found its way  to her chest, above her heart.</p><p>How could she have a nightmare now? Everything was going great and now... she felt scared and didn't  feel like being alone. How long had it been since she had a nightmare?</p><p>She tried to calm herself as she panted. She brought her knees to her chest and wiped the sweat away  from her brow but she started shaking. Akane picked her hand up away from her chest and stared at it.  The way it shook, trembled in the air. She'd never shaken this bad before. What was going on with her?  Her body was scared and quivering as though something were going to happen. Something was going to  hurt her. . .</p><p><i>'Ranma.'</i> She wanted him right then. She needed his comfort, his voice telling her that everything was  going to be all right...but she wasn't going to bother him. She'll find a way to get back to sleep. No  nightmare was going to frighten her, but her body disagreed and continued to shake. She hugged her  knees as she tried to think of something other than the horrible thoughts that roamed her mind.</p><p>Ranma had gotten up to get something to drink. Mr. Tendo gave him the biggest lecture about breaking  things in the house and not fixing them. How the items to actually <i>fix</i> the problem needed to be <i>bought</i>,  and he continued on for a while until Nabiki said that she would be able to cover the damage and, of  course, he would have to fix it.</p><p><i>'If it wasn't for those stupid assholes!'</i> He thought with anger. They were definitely stronger than they  appeared. But he shouldn't have underestimated them, especially the one that broke in. Unconsciously,  he growled as he walked up the stairs. <i>'That bastard hurt Akane!'</i> He remembered seeing them before  around the school campus. Always picking on cute girls. They always gave his fiancee a strange glare.  Ranma's hands clenched into tight fists. He knew what he saw in their glare and chose to ignore it,  knowing that they would never touch Akane.</p><p><i> 'Akane...'</i> His mind suddenly shifted to what happened after he cleaned the mess. He smiled to himself.  Thinking about her now always brought a smile to his lips. He slowly opened the door to his room. As  he stepped though he suddenly heard Akane's voice. Ranma paused for a moment before he hurried to  her room and opened the door enough to peer inside.</p><p>She was sitting up on her bed with her knees drawn to her chest, her head lowered and he noticed her  breathing hard. He opened the door and her head abruptly jerked around, frightened.</p><p>"Akane?" He saw her form relax a little and swung her legs over the side of the bed. He shut her door  and sat down by her side. "Are you all right? Is something wrong?" She did not move for a moment as  she stared at his concerned blue eyes.</p><p>"I.. I'm fine. I just had a bad dream." Ranma relaxed and put his arm around her shoulder. He felt her  body trembling and the cold skin of her shoulder.</p><p>Akane took the invitation as she wrapped her arms around his torso, feeling the heat that his body  radiated knowing that this was something that she had wanted. She unconsciously pulled him closer to  herself to feed off of his warmth.</p><p>"Akane you ice cold! Are you sure your okay? You're trembling!" He stood, pushing her on her back  and bringing the comforter over her shivering body.</p><p>"Ranma, wait. Don't go. Please stay with me for a little while." Ranma looked into her almost teary  eyes. She held onto his wrist tightly, not letting go and he noticed her hands held no heat either. He was  getting worried.</p><p>"I'll sit right here until you fall asleep. Don't worry, everything will be okay." He sat down against her  headboard still looking into her upset eyes. She made sure he was not going to move before she closed  her eyes and nodded, snaking her arms around his waist. "Akane... " She pushed her face into his  stomach, holding him tighter.</p><p>"No Ranma." She said quietly. "Hold me close to you." A shiver went down his spine as he felt her icy  hands touch his lowerback.</p><p>"A.. are you sure? What happens-"</p><p>"Just for a little while. Please." He could not refuse her desperate plea and found himself sliding into  her bed as she picked up the blankets for him to get beneath. He pulled her into his arms and heard her  sigh out loud. His cheek rested against the top of her forehead, in which he gave a little kiss. She  snuggled closer against his warm body, feeling the finely toned muscles beneath his black top. The  comfort overflowed through her as she gave in to her slumber.</p><p>Ranma could feel his tiredness tug at his eyes to close. To rest his exhausted form. He knew he  shouldn't stay there for the chance of someone finding them in bed together, then the words of  'blackmail' or 'wedding' suddenly coming up, causing their lives to become very hectic within the next  twenty-four hours. But that didn't give him enough motivation to leave her side for some reason. He  took in a deep breath of her sweet-scented hair and smiled, dreaming of his happiness with his fiancee.</p><p>Kasumi was almost done in completing the morning breakfast. She noticed Nabiki, her father and Mr.  Saotome at the table ready to eat. Ranma and Akane still were not there. She began to bring out the  food and served everyone.</p><p>"Nabiki." She called kindly. "Would you mind knocking on Ranma and Akane's bedroom doors to let  them know that breakfast is ready?" Nabiki nodded and strolled up the stairs heading toward her sisters  room first. She knocked three times.</p><p>"Akane, breakfast is ready! You better be up!" She heard her sister moan and knew she over slept. She  sighed and walked back toward the stairs, stopping at Ranma's door. She knocked again and yelled.  "Saotome! Your dad is going to eat your breakfast if you don't get up! And I won't warn you again!" <i>'I'll  just leave that job to Akane.' </i> Nabiki snickered as she waited for a reply like his door swinging open,  screaming that his dad had better not touch his food or worried that Akane was going to be angry and  beat him up because they were going to be late for school. She waited again for a moment and her  suspicion aroused. She was going to peek inside this time but Kasumi called.</p><p>"Thank you for doing that Nabiki. You can come back down and finish your breakfast before it gets  cold." She stared at the door and decided against her actions. Nabiki left the door and headed down the  stairs to finish her breakfast.~~*~~</p><p>He could feel a great warmth relaxing his body. It was so soothing that he wouldn't dare move away  from it for anything in the world. He suddenly heard something knocking against his door and an  annoying voice piercing through to his ears. He turned over a bit trying to get rid of the noise but  instead he heard a moan and something shift beneath him. He hugged it tighter against him and felt a  hand sliding underneath his top. Ranma forced his sleepy eyes open to find Akane's head resting on his  chest and her arms wrapped loosely about his waist. He immediately forgot about the knocking and  screaming as she shifted and her head rose to look at him. Akane looked to him like a beautiful angel.  Her eyes half closed and slightly glossy, her tousled hair was sticking out at odd angels only making her  look cuter. She lightly purred his name as she automatically pulled herself up to him and wrapped her  arms around his neck. Her head dove straight into his shoulder and she seemed to have fallen back  asleep.</p><p>He remembered why he was there and the thoughts before he went to sleep. He had to get up before his  father started looking for him or Nabiki finding in the room, together.<i> 'Was that her knocking? Was  there even knocking or was that a dream?'</i> He did not want to take that chance.</p><p>"Akane." She moaned in his neck, snuggling impossibly closer to him as though he were a life line. He  started blushing, feeling her body up against his own. He called for her name again, though this time,  she didn't try to shove herself on him but pulled away slightly.</p><p>"Oh no, Ranma." She whispered. "I'm so sorry. You were probably so uncomfortable and you probably  wanted to go back to your own room but I didn't let you..." She looked down but Ranma shook his head  no. He didn't want her to think that what she had said was the truth.</p><p>"No Akane. I wasn't uncomfortable. In fact I really liked sleeping with you." He paused. <i>'Oh you idiot!  She's probably going to think you're a pervert and tried something on her while she was seeking  comfort from you.'</i> His body tensed and he began to turn crimson. "Wait, what I meant was, uh, your  wrong and-"</p><p>She felt his body tense up even more and looked up to see his face as bright as a cherry.</p><p>"I know what you meant Ranma. D..did you really like sleeping with me?" He smiled widely.</p><p>"Yeah, I guess all those rumors about you sleeping like a gorilla isn't true after all." She took hold of  his shirt tightly as her anger rose.</p><p>"Ran-!" He pulled her against him as he tenderly placed his lips against her own. He ran his hand  through her soft, mussed hair and Akane's anger quickly dissipated as she released her grip from  Ranma's tank top. Her arms found their way around his neck, begging him to get closer, to deepen the  kiss.</p><p>Ranma suddenly tensed above her making her believe that she did something wrong. She pulled back  and looked into his face where panic was written all over it. "R..Ranma? Is everything-" Ranma looked  down to her and shushed her. He quickly jumped out of bed and ran into the middle of her room  looking around frantically, as if something was in the room that she could not see. "Ranma? What's-"</p><p>"I was never here!" He quietly said in a hurry as he jumped into her closet shutting it quickly. She  looked at the door, puzzled. Suddenly her bedroom door opened and Kasumi stepped in followed by  Nabiki, poking her head through.</p><p>"Akane. You know you have to get up for school. Your going to be late if you do not hurry to dressed  now." Nabiki peeked around looking for a certain pig-tailed boy but she did not see him. She smiled as  suddenly looked at the window, seeing it closed and locked. Her smile disappeared as she realized that  he wasn't in there. Ranma would have left the window open a little or unlocked. She snapped her  fingers in defeat. <i>'Oh it's so no over yet!'</i></p><p>"Where's Ranma?" Nabiki stepped out from behind Kasumi and studied Akane's eyes. Akane did not  look anywhere but at her as she knew what her sister was doing and it was making her angry.</p><p>"Shouldn't that baka be in his room or taking a bath?" Akane questioned harshly, though not meaning  for it to sound so mean.</p><p>"Well he's not there." Akane sat up and stepped out of bed.</p><p>"So then try the bath or the dojo! Why are you asking me?" Nabiki stepped back a little seeing her  sister get angry.</p><p>"It's his loss if he doesn't make it to school on time. I'm leaving now so I suggest you hurry and get  dressed, Akane." Nabiki turned around and Kasumi looked back and forward between Akane and her  retreating sister.</p><p>"Akane dear, will you look for Ranma when you're done? I have to clear the table of dishes and warm  your breakfast up." She closed her door and left down the stairs.</p><p>Akane looked at her closet door and sighed. They didn't have a lot of time left to eat and walk to  school. They will probably end up running like they did almost every morning. She walked up to her  door and locked it quickly before she slid open her closet door. She looked inside and spotted Ranma  hugging the furthest wall.</p><p>"Ranma, it's okay. You can come out now." She heard his barely audible sigh of relief and she watched  him crawl out. "We have to hurry or we're going to be late." He nodded and turned toward her door but  Akane reached out to his arm and pulled him slightly to halt. "Wait Ranma. I didn't mean what I called  you. You're not a jerk." She smiled.
