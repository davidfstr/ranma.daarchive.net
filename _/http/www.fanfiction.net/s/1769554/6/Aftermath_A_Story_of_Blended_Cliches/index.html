</div><p>Author still behind tree:<p>Um, hello again. Okay I admit to playing really loose and fast with the Sailor Moon universe. So there.<p>I hope you all will enjoy this anyway.<p>I am planning on re-visiting my earlier chapters to clean them up, but at this stage I more concerned with getting the story out. I'm afraid if I try to go back right now I'll get "bogged" down and not finish this.<p>And I wanna finish this.<p>This chapter got out so fast because it was part of the previous chapter, which got kinda big. The next one will take a little longer.<p>Boldly going where others had gone before and meekly going where few have been.<p>I don't own any of these characters or situations, this is done purely for fun, and so far its been fun.<p>_<p>Juuban part 4<p>************<p>When she got up the Monday after, Akiko asked if she would like to stay home that day to recover from the events of the pervious day. Though Ranma thought about it, she decided against it, seeing getting back into a routine as the key to putting what had happened behind her.<p>Wow, Ranma wanting to go back to school.<p>The first day at school after the "incident" was somewhat nerve-racking for Ranma. Thank god for Michiko and her friends that were there to run interference. Word had gotten around that a famous molester, panty thief and master martial artist was killed by a red-headed girl who was also martial artist, who on top of that, saved a bunch of people from getting blown up. There were very few red-headed teenaged girls in Juuban, and among them, there was only one that knew martial arts. A lot of people were putting two and two together, and it didn't help that several of Ranma's classmates were at the park at the time, too.<p>Everyone seem to be trying to ask a lot of questions, without looking like they were trying to ask a lot questions.<p>Shielded as she was from the blunt of the curiosity seekers by her friends, it was slowly wearing Ranma down, and she felt great relief when the bell sounded ending the school day.<p>The curiosity seekers didn't end at school.<p>When Michiko and Ranma made their way home at the end of the day, a crowd was gathered outside the restaurant waiting for it to open. Working through the crowd and entering, Michiko and Ranma did their usual "getting ready for work" routine and headed down stairs. Akiko was waiting for them.<p>"Ranma dear, I need to ask you something", Akiko broached the subject.<p>"Yes, granny?"<p>"Do you know why there is a crowd outside?"<p>"Ah.. 'cause their hungry?" she ventured.<p>"That's "because", and no, not just because their hungry." Akiko corrected without any edge in her voice.<p>"Then why?"<p>"Ranma , dear their here to see you. I don't want to upset you, I know you been through a lot."<p>"B.. but why? Why would a bunch of people want to see me?<p>"Well dear, call it morbid curiosity - they heard a rumor about a certain red-head girl whose a martial artist that - deposed of a long time trouble maker and they want to see for themselves what you look like." Akiko said somewhat dejectedly.<p>Ranma paled. God, this was worse than she imagined. Her thoughts were interrupted by Akiko again.<p>"I can understand if don't want to work tonight, I'm sure we can get by without you." Akikio said in her patented gentle way.<p>Ranma thought about it. Did she want to be on display like this? To have people stare at her and whisper behind her back or in front of her? Hell no! She didn't want that, but it was going to happen whether she was there or not. With that in mind, she steel herself for what was to come and answered.<p>"Don't bother, Granny. I'll be fine, once the crowds curiosity is satisfied things will get back to normal. I'll be okay." Ranma said with a reassuring (she hoped) grin.<p>"Are you sure?" Akiko replied with a raised eyebrow and hint of - pride in her voice.<p>"Yes, Granny I'm sure - let'em come and stare. It'll be good for business while it lasts." Ranma said with a half-grin that didn't reach her eyes.<p>Akiko nodded at that, then asked Michiko to unlock the door. A busy night was ahead of them.<p>Later...<p>Ranma had concentrated on her work to survived the evening. The crowds that moved in and out of the restaurant were much larger than normal and the behavior was anything but. Staring, long looks, whispered comments and subtle questions kept Ranma on edge the entire dinner rush. When it was over she silently thanked the powers that be that she made it through.<p>The whisphered coments were the thing that bugged Ranma the most. The  So that's her ,  She don't look like the type... ,  She must be really good...  to one that nearly made her drop five orders of hamburgers, a pizza and the tea pot balanced on her head:  I wonder if she as good in bed as she is at fighting?<p>After the resturant was closed and before clean up started Ranma excused herself and retreated into the bathroom...<p>... then she locked herself in for what seemed like a good, long cry.<p>Afterword, while helping clean the kitchen, she thought about why she couldn't understand why a bunch of people would come all the way down here just to look at her. Ranma sighed. Long ago she remember saying that she'll never understand girls - now its just she'll never understand some people. Widening her scope to include males as well as females. Shaking her head to clear her mind she emptied one of her large pockets of her apron, well at least the crowd tipped good.<p>*********************<p>Later in the same week...<p>Ranma was glad when her prediction was true. After the third night the crowd dwindled to back its normal busy as heck levels. After that she never gave it a second thought.<p>Ranma, finishing the last of her homework with Michiko retired for the night.<p>Laying in her futon she wonder for the how umpteenth time what it all her dreams could mean. It was really starting to get to her. She was starting to think it was stress, like Michiko and Akiko suggested, but there was something else, what she didn't know, but she got the impression that something was holding her back, keeping it from her. Ranma got annoyed with herself and finally rolled over and went to sleep.<p>**********************<p>Ranma was thankful to have Michiko in her life.<p>Over the course of the passing weeks Ranma and Michiko started getting closer. For Ranma it was nice to have someone to talk to that wasn't out to get her, and she felt comfortable talking about anything: school, work and weird dreams. The death of Happosai had especially been a hard blow on Ranma emotionally but Michiko had the same patients as Akiko and helped Ranma through her difficulties. Talking does help, Ranma discovered.<p>Ranma thought back in the past about how the as treated. She could never talk about anything with anyone. Her father - no ex-father never cared, and if she wanted to talk about her thoughts and feelings he would say something idiotic like "Quiet boy! You sound like a girl talking that way." Ranma thought, no not thought, knew no one cared for her. They would either take things the wrong way or try to sell it to the highest bidder for a quick buck or worse yet, think of her feelings as unimportant.<p>Here it was different. Ranma felt she could confess her deepest thoughts to Michiko or Akiko and they would listen without judgment and make helpful suggestions or comments. What she thought and felt was important. If this is what it feels like to be treated as a human being, Ranma began to think that maybe she should have left the Tendo's a long time ago.<p>Ranma also recognized that she was changing from within. In the past she used to fight and cling to her manhood, after life on the streets it stopped mattering. Trying to survive took all her attention from whether she was a boy or a girl and after awhile she stopped caring. All she cared about was just getting through another day. Now she was settled and thoughts of finding a cure or something to unlock the curse never seem to cross her mind. The ideal of staying like this and living her whole life as a girl didn't seem like such a bad thing anymore. There was still a small part of her that wanted to be a man again, but overall being a man now seemed unimportant and trivial. She was happy the way she was, and was adapting to being a girl.<p>Hell, talking over about what boys Michiko liked didn't make her sick anymore.<p>Ranma's life has improved, or so she felt, past the level it was when she was at the Tendo's. She started thinking that maybe the hardship of the streets were worth it if it meant ending up here.<br/>Also she found, the work at the restaurant was fulfilling in its own way, not because she was working for room and board but because she cared about the people she was working with.<p>**************<p>She was laughing again. She always felt that way after a ball.<p>The ball had been such fun, they always were. She was walking along the long carpeted hallway with two other faceless girls as they merrily bantered back and forth and each other. The tall windows that filled one side of the gallery showed the Earth hanging in the deep blackness of space. One of the figures, taller than her dressed in a formal tuxedo, with short close-cropped blond hair leaned forward and kiss Ranma on the cheek.<p>Ranma blushed, giggled and batted playfully at her friend. The other faceless girl, that was shorter than the first had shoulder length turquoise hair and dressed in a formal gown much like the one Ranma was wearing leaned in and kissed Ranma's other cheek. All three joined in another round of giggling.<p>Ranma knew these were Senshi, Uranus and Neptune, and she had a special bond with these two. Not as close as they had with each other of course, nothing could come between them, nothing. But they were fun to be with when they all were together at court...<p>...but she had a secret. What they didn't know she was a Senshi too. Oh, Ranma wanted to tell them so badly, but Serenity made her promise not to say anything to anyone. The price paid for being a  secret weapon . But a promise is a promise and she always kept her promises.<p>Pooh.<p>The two faceless girls stopped in front of their door and said their goodnights. Ranma sighed, with a smile on her face, and wished them a goodnight as well. Fun never lasts forever. Then the faceless Neptune whispered something into the taller ones ear. They laughed and turned to look at Ranma and invited her in. Ranma laughed at them and entered their chambers.<p>The faceless Uranus lead the way while the faceless Neptune closed the door behind them, more playful talking and laughing. Ranma felt a soft touch on her back as her gown loosen around her. Ranma giggle and rolled her shoulder seductively -<p>- her gown was now at her ankles, she wore nothing underneath.<p>Neptune came up from behind and pressed her warm, soft and now naked body against Ranma's back and rested her head on Ranma's shoulder, a red head next to a turquoise head. Both facing a smiling and flushed Uranus. Together the two girls moved forward as one toward a blond, tranfixed and tuxedoed girl...<p>... Ranma had played this game before with them...<p>**************************<p>Ranma cracked her eyes open into narrow slits, laying under the covers still warm from the dream she just woke with.<p>"Oh man." Ranma moaned softly from her futon, "I really am turning into a pervert."<p>[..and you loved every minute of it.]<p>[Yeah, I did, didn't I. I didn't know I was that flexible.] smiling weakly.<p>[ahh, the joys of sharing with very "special" friends.]<p>[You said it, I wonder how Uranus did that with her -] the smile broadened.<p>[- and who knew Neptune could be so domineering when she  dealt with you?]<p>[I ain't complaining, I surprised I wasn't sorer, they sure know how to treat a girl...] smiling even wider.<p>Then eyes widened as Ranma realized what she had been thinking and then blushed hard, turning even redder on top of being flushed from being aroused from the dream. Kicking off her covers she froze on examining her night clothes.<p>[Ah man, I thought only guys did that.]<p>She clean up her futon and then set it out to air out on the back roof. Then she dashed down the hall to bathe. With cold water. With lots and lots of cold water.<p>************************<br/>As Ranma made her way downstairs, early as usual to start her workout she pondered, Neptune and Uranus? Names? Yes. "Special" friends? If her dream was any indication, hell yes. To date it was the most - vivid dream Ranma has had in the last week. There had been a few of them, but they usually left Ranma with a fleeting feeling after she has been awake for awhile. Not this one. This one was solidly in place between her eyes. What did this all mean and who were these people?<p>[Man, these dreams are getting weirder and weirder.]<p>But, she had to admit to herself, it was Blush  pushing all thoughts of the night before out of her conscience mind she filed the dream away for future thought. She then began to quickly rearrange the dinning room to give her room for her morning practice.<p>**************<p>Akiko had been having discussions with her father over Ranma. After hearing about Ranma's life from Akiko, he said he would consider it after checking out Ranma's background. That was done, and for the most part Ranma's story checked out - right down to the multiple fiance's, an abusing tomboy, a extortionist, a nutty samurai wannabe and a "little troll of a woman" as the private investigator described it. Having a brother who ran a private investigation service did come in handy to the family. Anyway, her father approved and drew up papers if Ranma accepted. Akiko did want to help Ranma out and giving her a family name would go along way in helping.<p>She decided to broach the subject with Ranma tonight after work.<p>***************<p>At school during lunch Ranma was involved in an interesting conversation. The buzz was about the Senshi fighting some demons or monsters the night before and Ranma had to ask about it.<p>"You haven't heard of the Senshi?" Ranma's friend Chiyo exclaimed.<p>"I thought everyone's heard of them." added Hitomo.<p>"Girls, Ranma is new to our ward, she hasn't heard of the weird going on's here because she was keeping up with the weird going on's in her old ward." Michiko said in Ranma's defense.<p>"Ah... so who are the Senshi?" Ranma ventured into unknow territory.<p>They're a group of magic girls that go around and fight for love and justice!" Chiyo said dramatically. A little too dramatic as Ranma almost gagged.<p>"They go out and fight these demons that go around terrorizing and hurting innocent people. They even save an uncle of mine once during and attack at one the shopping districts." Hitomo said rather proudly.<p>"So... they fight demons?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yes and they slay them, too." Ranma paled at that a little, killing being a sensitive subject for her right now.<p>Michiko sensing her friends unease steered the conversation a little. "They're nine of them that we know of. All named after the planets."<p>[Planets?] Ranma thought then asked "Why?"<p>"No one really knows why, but there seem to be two distinct groups called the Inners and the Outers. The Inners all have the names of the planets up to Jupiter. Except Earth, for some reason there was no Sailor Earth, but there is a Sailor Moon." Michiko stated<p>"But there is Tuxedo Mask." Hitomo interjected.<p>"Sailors? Tuxedo Mask?" Ranma getting lost.<p>"Yes, Tuxedo Mask. He's a real handsome man who fights along side the Sailor Scouts." Tamami who was now getting into the conversation, gushing about a man no one has really gotten a good look at.<p>"Sailors or Sailor Scouts is what the Senshi are also called. " Chiyo added, clearing up that issue.<p>"Oh, what about ah... the Outers?"<p>"Oh yeah, they show up from time-to-time, they are named after the plants beyond Jupiter. There's Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto who hardly ever shows up. They can kick any demons ass!" Chiyo said a little too excitedly for Ranma's taste, but she overlooked it considering how much she enjoyed her company overall.<p>[Neptune and Uranus?] Ranma mused.<p>Before the conversation could continue the lunch bell rang and it was time to go back to class.<p>*************<br/>That evening all during the dinner rush, Ranma's mind was occuptied by what she had learned at lunch today. Neptune and Uranus. Two names. Two names that were used by two of the Senshi. Two names that figured prominently in the last dream she had. Was there a connection? If so, how would Ranma go about finding out?<p>They have been in the news a lot lately, maybe it was coincidence that she has the dream right after hearing about the demon they destroyed in the streets. The rough description that Hitomo, gave was close enough to match what she saw in her dreams. Ranma was starting to get a creepy feeling all over, like the kind you get when you are about to hit upon something. The feeling passed when one of her tables signaled for more tea.<p>Maybe she should seek them out, was her last thought on the subject.<p>***************<p>Ranma had just finished up mopping the floor and was preparing to rearrange the furniture back into its original location when she was interrupted.<p>"Ranma dear. Do you have a minute?" Akiko asked as Ranma was gripping the edge of a table.<p>"Sure, Granny. Give me a sec." And within that second it seemed that Ranma had restored the room to its original configuration. Akiko had gotten use to Ranma's displays of speed, witnessing it every morning, but it was still a thrill to see it in action.<p>"What can I do for you Granny?" Ranma asked, hardly out of breath.<p>"Well, Ranma its not so much what you can do for me, its what I can do for you."<p>Ranma blinked.<p>"Remember after - that incident - I talked with you on the difficulties you would face now that you are ronin?"<p>Ranma nodded, she remembered. Akiko continued<p>"Well, I talked to my father about it and after "checking you out" so to speak, he has agreed to my request to bring you into the Yonai clan." The last said with a certain amount of satisfaction and hope.<p>Ranma was stunned by these turn of events. First this women, no, this kind woman and family takes her in, a nameless nobody, treats her with kindness and respect, gives her a job, a home and now wants to know if she would be interested in joining their family. Ranma had only one answer.<p>"I would be honored to."<p>******************<p>This Saturday being an off day, it was decided that Yonai family would get together at the restaurant and greet its newest member. Ranma was understandably nervous. She fretted about her clothes and played with her long ponytail, trying to keep calm. Family, these people would be the ones she would call family, that thought excited her and scared her at the same time. Excited her because she did feel like she was part of the family as far a Akiko and Michiko were concerned, scared because she was afraid that she would do something to screw it up. It all added up to a nervousness that over-ruled everything. She had just used the toilet for the 6th time in 20 minutes.<p>Finally the appointed hour neared, a group of about twenty people of all ages entered through the front door with the sign "Closed - private party" hanging from it. Ranma's nerves were building for another restroom run when Akiko calmed her with a hand too her shoulder. Ranma looked at Akiko who was smiling at her and then turn in the direction that she indicated with a nod as an elderly man with a cane in one hand hobbled in through the front door flanked by younger man.<p>You can tell the older gentleman was a Yonai. The same hazel eyes that seem to permeated everyone born into clan were blazing under the balding head and elfish nose set in a oval shaped face. The younger one looked like younger version of the older one, you could tell that they were of the same family. The duo came up to Ranma and the older of the two addressed her.<p>"I take it you are Ranma?" The elderly man said with care in a slightly high pitched voice.<p>Ranma bowed low. "Yes sir, I am."<p>The elderly man nodded his head, "I am Hiroji, head of the Yonai clan. On behalf of the clan members here, I welcome you into it."<p>"It is an honor to be welcome into such a family as honorable as yours." Ranma replied while bowing again, hoping she was making a good impression. [Darn it! I shouldn't have had that glass of water!]<p>"Come," Hiroji said, with his free hand extended, "let me introduce you to the rest of the family..."<p>**************<p>In another part of Juuban, another type of meeting was taking place. This time in Ami's bedroom, for the shrine and Rei's grandfather was going to be busy with visitors that day. Ami had just finished telling the others what she had found out about the creation of the scouts, and the restricted access to Sailor Suns files. She also demonstrated where on the computer she had found the files.<p>Minako was a little annoyed, "Why the hell did they name my project Cornfield?"<p>Ami, in trying to keep the meeting on course, quickly took the other scouts through the files that she had discovered and stopped at the splash screen of Sailor Sun. The four girls (well four of them, the fifth was reading a manga she brought with her) were studying the screen.<p>"How do you enter a password on this thing? There is no place to put one." Makoto asked.<p>Ami blinked at that, something she over looked and didn't even consider. Re-studying the screen she could see what Makoto was pointing out, there was no place for a password to be entered. With that thought she wondered how did the computer knew it was her? Surly it wouldn't let anyone have access to the Moon Kingdom files. Hmmm.<p>"Maybe you just have to have someone with access to the files start and use the computer." Usagi said off handedly, without thinking, all the while still having her nose in her comic. [Oh! This is so romantic!]<p>The other four girls stopped what they were doing and stared at her, two slacked jawed.<p>Later...<p>"Okay, click here." Ami guided Usagi through the menus.<p>"Like before?" Usagi asked.<p>Ami breathed out. "Yes, just like before." This was slow going. Usagi just discovered the simple joys of clicking and Ami was glad it was simple because she didn't think Usagi could handle anything more complex.<p>"Okay, now go down here and click."<p>"Like before?"<p>"Yes, just like before." Ami said while Usagi obeyed the instructions.<p>Before to long (it felt long to everyone else in the room, except for Usagi who thought the whole thing was "neat") they soon found themselves at where the splash page was in question.<p>"Now try to click though." Ami said.<p>"Like before?"<p>"Yes, Yes, YES! Like before!" Rei shouted, long having lost her patients. At least her project had a cool name. [Cornfield] snicker<p>"Whaaa! Don't yell at me, I'm doing the best I can."<p>Ami rubbed her temples, was this really worth it? "Yes, Usagi. Like before." she finally worked out.<p>Usagi clicked. The splash page immediately changed to a listing of files.<p>"Good! Were in! Now Usagi, go click on the line that says "Summary and History" it's right there near the top." Ami said while pointing to the line mentioned.<p>Moving the pointer to the said line Usagi hesitated, "Like before?"<p>Ami rolled her eyes, Rei bit into a pillow to keep from screaming and Minako and Makoto looked on at her with bemusement.<p>Sigh, "Yes, like before."<p>The history of Sailor Sun laid bare before them. The four girls heads moved closer to each other, reading the creation of a Sailor Scout that according to the records from the Silver Millennium, never existed.<p>************<p>The pseudo-cat was pleased with its readings from the last set of probing attacks. The only one that the council was concerned about was the cause of the very large energy spike that occured well over a week ago. As it expected, when the pseudo-cat managed to located the location of where the spike occurred, there was nothing more than residual energy. Not enough to really gage the amount or type of energy but enough to know that it did disrupt the space/time locally. This would be a formable opponent if they were ever to faced it. All the shock troops, mid and heavy troops and Exterminators that would come later, that have been build up over the centuries, would not stand a chance against such a force.<p>It would have liked to have sent the flyer out to scout around, but it had yet to return from its  spot checking  mission. It would have to do this without its assistance.<p>Faced with the possibility of an unknown powerful opponent, it was no surprise that the council sent their ultimate weapon through to the pseudo-cat for safe keeping. If the invasion, or "re-construction" as it was referred to was threaten by this unknown and powerful factor then it could be dealt with.<p>Deep inside the interior of the pseudo-cat, hidden from view, the Protectors ultimate weapon, developed over the centuries was dormant, awaiting the instructions that would turn it loose. But like anything that has tremendous power it was feared by its creators. Anything with that much power would be impossible to control if it decided to go rogue.<p>It could be their own undoing.<p>*************<p>"Wow." That was the general comment from three of the people in the room. Ami having read hers and Tuxedo Masks files was less than impressed. Usgai long getting board, sat in front of the computer reading her manga again.<p>"I don't understand this" Ami began, "I was expecting some deep hidden secrets or something. This was pretty much like the other files on how we... I mean the Senshi were created."<p>"You mean the other files are pretty much like this?" Rei asked<p>"Pretty much." Ami Answered.<p>"Cool, movies!" Usagi said enthusiastic.<p>"Where?" the other four girls said at the same time.<p>"There, see"." said while pointing at a group of files with the heading "Videos of Tests"<p>"Pick one" Ami said, excitement in her voice, maybe this will show us something.<p>Usagi moved the pointer over a file and opened her mouth.<p>"Yes, like before!" Rei said before Usagi could say anything. She pouted and clicked.<p>The screen filled with a video of Sailor Sun flying up through the clouds before summoning a sword from nowhere and slashing the air before her...<p>***************<p>The four scouts sat dumbfounded. Even Usagi was effected by what she saw, long forgetting her manga.<p>"Oh my god." was her only comment.<p>"A whole solar system - just like that." Minako said quitely.<p>"Such power." Rei<p>"And reading the attached commentary this was just one of her low end, high-powered attacks." Ami stated, then turned from the screen to face her fellow scouts, "That means she is more powerful than that and she was holding back."<p>"I though Saturn..." Rei began<p>Saturn is like a match to an atomic blast next to Sailor Sun." Ami compared, "My question is why we haven't found out about her before now?"<p>"A black project." Minako stated, feeling she a pretty good grasp of the situation.<p>"A black project.?" Ami and Rei inquired, at the same time.<p>"Well, that is what they called it in this movie I saw. Anyway it is a project that's so secret that it doesn't offically exist." Minako continued, "If this is a black project though, than why did we find it?"<p>Ami picked up and theorized, "Well, as Sensi it would be natural to assume that we would be granted a certain amount of clearance. Some," looking at Usagi, "more than others. We stumbled on the files for Sun by not really looking for them."<p>"Huh?" Makoto puzzled<p>"Remember, we found the files by going thru the file on the Protectors - not a direct path. The link must was been overlooked when whoever, or whatever put the archives together." Ami seemed satisfied with her theory. The rest of the girls seemed to be to.<p>"That leaves the question of why keep it secret from us?" Rei asked.<p>"Maybe," Usagi decided to put her two cents in, "seeing how the people reacted to Saturn, they decided to keep Sun a secret, after all people were scared of Saturn because she could destroy a world."<p>Hell, Sun could sneeze wrong and take out a world.  Rei snorted.<p>"Maybe..." Ami thought, was she missing anything? No. "Maybe it is as simple."<p>"What did you find out about Ranma herself?" Minoko asked quietly<p>"Nothing" Ami replied "I looked up her school record but there wasn't anything helpful"<p>"Who is this girl?" Rei asked, exasperated.<p>"Can you show us what you did find?" Makoto asked<p>"Yes" Ami answered as she reached for the Mercury computer. The instant she touch the computer the Sailor Sun page that they were looking at reverted to the Splash page with the restricted flags on it top and bottom. [That's interesting.]<p>Ami quickly brought up the school files on Ranma. The only difference she note that under the family name there was now Yonai listed there, other than that there was nothing of interest.<p>"What about any other Ranma's in the system?" Minako<p>"Tried that." Ami replied, "There all males."<p>"Oooo, let's see." Makoto said clearly interested.<p>Ami sighed [Oh, what the hell.] She began to punch up the four Ranma's she had found before, this time listing them with a more detail descriptions and with pictures.<p>Four heads once again crowded around the tiny Mercury computer. The third one down caught Makoto attention.<p>"Wow, He reminds me of my ex-boyfriend."<p>Four eyes rolled, including Usagi who was back at reading her manga.<p>Ami was about to clear the screen when something caught her attention. [Nerima ? where have I heard that before?]<p>"Ami, what's wrong?" Minako asked noticing the slightly puzzled look across Ami's face.<p>"I'm not sure, I've heard the name Nerima before, but I can't remember where." Ami pondered, hard. Where did she hear the ward Nerima before? [It was recent, maybe three or four weeks ago - I was in class, the lunch bell just rang and Tamami came over from the class next door and - of course!]<p>"I got it!" Ami said loud enough that the other girls jumped. "I almost forgot, when Ranma first got here she was having problems with some math problems and Tamami, who is the same class as Ranma came over and got me to help explain it to her."<p>The other three girls, and a forth who was now half pay attention just looked at Ami.<p>"And...?" Rei prompted<p>"Tamami introduced me to Ranma who she explained just transfered from the Nerima ward." Ami concluded.<p>The other girls just blinked back Ami.<p>Sigh"Lets have another look at this Ranma from the Nerima ward." Ami declared as she brought up a more detailed file - this one sporting a larger, clearer picture that interested Makoto even more.<p>"Let's see Ranma Saotome, age 16, blah, blah, blah say, it says he hasn't attended school there in about the last six, no more like seven months." Minako pointed out.<p>"No way! A cute hunk like that dropped out?" Makoto interjected. Then more quietly "Um...where is he staying?"<p>Ami rolled her eyes, "It says he staying at the Tendo dojo, well at least up until six months ago."<p>"Tendo dojo?" Makoto<p>"Yes," Ami said while bring up a query, "And it appears that there are three Tendo's going to Furinkan High School with him." she did this while bringing up a screen listing the three Tendo's with pictures.<br/>Akane Tendo<br/>Nabiki Tendo<br/>Ranko Tendo<p>The room went silent. There was no doubt, Ranko Tendo and the girl calling herself Ranma were one in the same.<p>*********************<p>It was about seven o'clock in the evening when the party broke up. Ranma, who was feeling a little overwhelmed at first, quickly gotten use to the Yonai clan in mass. They all shared the same traits, and she quickly grew attached to all of them. They seem the accept her past and promise to help her with her future.<p>After helping in the clean up Ranma and Michiko sat around in the living room talking about everything that had happened that evening. From uncle Shoji breaking out a portable keraoki machine to one of the elderly aunts, Komachi, mispronouncing Ranma's name. Ranma and Michiko giggled at that. "Ranki","Ranko" (which made Ranma feel just a little depressed, but not by much), and "Ranchi" were just a few of the examples of the names than aunt Komachi called Ranma throughout the day.<p>After a few hours and some additional prep work for the restaurant for Monday (they were closed on Sundays), Ranma and Michiko bathed then retired for the night.<p>Ranma laid awake and staring off at the darken ceiling, with a warm feeling surrounding her. The warmth didn't just come from the comforter that protected her from the cool night air wafting through the open window. No. This warmed can from the feeling of belonging. Ranma Yonai. Had a nice ring to it, Ranma Yonai. Yep, it sure did. She sighed satisfyingly and snuggled closer under the blankets getting comfortable in there warm embrace. Wait a minute...<p>Open window?<p>I didn't open the window.<p>Exploding from the futon she summersaulted up and over, turning on the overhead light by its pull string while in mid air. Landing in a guarded position she face her intruder.<p>Hello Ranma<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed dangerously toward a man who was two weeks dead.<p>Happosai.<p></p>
