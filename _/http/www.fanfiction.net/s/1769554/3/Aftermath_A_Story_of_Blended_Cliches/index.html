</div><p>This is chapter three of part two (which is part 1) of my first fan fiction of my (suppose to be) one shot that somehow grew.<p>Boldly going where others had gone before and meekly going where few have been.<p>I, once again own none of these characters. All spelling and grammar errors are bought and paid for so I'll gladly claim those.<p>_<p>Juuban - part 1<p>*****************<p>Akiko lead Ranma in thru the back door of the restaurant. Ranma, somehow remembering her pack, allowed herself to be lead by the hand. She was not really paying attention to her environment. So powerful was her outburst, it left her feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted. She felt numb and lost, awash in a sea of emotional uncertainty. She didn't notice as Akiko steered her through the kitchen, a sizable, but empty dinning room up a flight of stairs and into a bathroom.<p>Here we are dear, let's get you cleaned up.<p>Wha.. what?<p>Akiko looked up from the sink where she was washing her hands.<p>Let's get you cleaned up' Akiko repeated patently, obvious to her charges condition, then added,  you start while I find you something clean to change into.<p>With that Akiko dried her hands, and silently left the bathroom.<p>After she left, Ranma stood there, still stunned from the sudden turn of events. Taking in her surroundings for the first time, she found herself in a modest bath room. The room was smaller than the one at the Tendo's, cozy would be the best word used to describe it. The tile was small and in a pale blue-speckled with solid white tile inter-spaced randomly. Two stools were up against the wall, one on its side near the bathing area with an inverted bucket laying nearby, a shower head on a flexible hose attached to the faucets that would come to just below chest level if she were sitting on one of the stools before it. In the corner, below a high window, was a small deep furro , again not as large as the one at the Tendo's but comfortable enough for one, maybe two people, if you were small enough - or close enough. Again the only word Ranma could think of to describe the whole scene was cozy. With that thought, she began to strip off her soiled clothes.<p>Across the hall Akiko knocked twice on a door that was decorated with small stickers of idol singers, and without waiting for an answer, entered the room. The room's lone occupant looked up from the book and papers she had laid out before her on the low laying table with questioning eyes.<p>She was good looking girl in her teens, her eyes the same color as her grandmothers, hazel. Her face was oval shaped, and she had the habit of twirling a lock of her shoulder length light brown hair around a finger while studying. But right at this moment she had the tried look of a coal miner, trying to dig herself out of a mountain of homework.<p>"Michiko, dear, we have guest, can I borrow some of your clothes until we can do something with the ones she has."<p>"Yes, of course, Grandma, who is it?" she inquired while raising from her seated position.<p>"I'm not sure. I found the poor dear rummaging through our dumpster in the back. I think she was looking for something to eat."<p>"To eat? From our dumpster?" she asked while extracting a light red dress from her closet before crossing her room to a small dresser to pull other items out of a drawer.<p>"Yes, I think the poor thing was been living on the street for lord only knows how long - she is a lovely looking girl - I can't imagine what could have happen to her.<p>"A run away?" Michiko ventured.<p>"Somehow I don't think so. I don't think she looked the type to run away from anything if she could help it, something about her eyes tell me so." Akiko had always thought herself as a good judge of character, a trait that has served her well throughout her life. It helped her find a good man for a husband and avoid the 'bad apples' in her life. She trusted her feelings toward Ranma.<p>" We'll find out more, once she's cleaned up. Could you do me a favor dear, and get some food started for our guest? Tomorrow is Sunday, so you won't have any school, you could finish your homework then."<p>Michiko nodded as she exited her room and headed for the stairs. Gathering the clothing she got from Michiko, Akiko crossed the way over to the bathroom, she halted at the door and knocked twice before entering.<p>*********************<p>Ranma was sitting on one of the stools, scrubbing herself down. It was alot more work than she figured. She had always thought she had been keeping reasonably clean using the rest rooms in the park for washing, but the more she scrubbed the more dirt and grim seem to come out. What was really scary the filth never seemed to stop coming off her. The water that was going down the floor drain was as muddy and the river water that she used to rise herself off in the mornings. She sighed heavily. She had not even started on her hair yet. She was just undoing the dragon's whisker from the end of her pigtail when two soft knocks interrupted her.<p>Akiko quickly enter the bathroom and look at her charge. She set the borrowed clothes upon one of the small shelves that was set over the sink and crossed the short distance to Ranma and began helping her unbraid her hair.<p>"Here sweetie, let me help you with that."<p>"Ah.. it's okay, I don't want to be much of a bother."<p>"It's quite all right sweetie, if it was a bother I wouldn't have brought you in. Now let me help you with your hair."<p>Ranma remained still as Akiko unbraided her hair. "I.. I'm sorry" she said as the last of the hair was unlocked, " I don't even no your name."<p>"That's okay child, I was so concerned about you, I'm afraid I didn't have time to make proper introductions. My name is Akiko"."<p>"I'm Ranma, sorry about this."<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for child, lets get you cleaned up and feed and then you can tell me all about it."<p>The rest of the bath was spent in silence.<p>*******************<p>It took some doing to finally get clean. Ranma's hair was more of a mess than she could imagine. It took at least four washing before Akiko declared Ranma's hair clean enough. After being scrubbed and washed, Ranma felt warm and light. She felt like she lost 20 pounds, all of it dirt. While she was drying off Akiko excused herself to check on the food that her grand daughter was preparing, leaving Ranma alone.<p>Ranma stared at herself in the floor length mirror that was located just to the right of the bathroom door, opposite the wall with the two shelves and the sink. It was the first time she was able to see all of her in god knows how long. Life on the streets had changed her, gone was the baby fat that smoothed her frame and accentuated her female figure, and in its place was a thin, lean, and muscled frame - alittle too thin as the ribs of her chest and hips were clearly visible through her taunt skin.<p>Her skin, her skin used to be almost milky in complexion, on it looked sickly and pale to her. Her eyes haven't changed, still blue. Her face was thinner and her hair! Her unbound hair was halfway down, no! almost to the small of her back - how long <b>was</b> she on the streets? That was the question she kept coming back to. How long? On the streets she didn't care - one day was the same as every other - now looking at herself for the first time in so long, she couldn't help but wonder.<p>She examined her arms and legs, both were thinner but more muscular - a tribute to doing nothing but martial arts everyday. Her abdomen was slightly sunken in, a tribute to the lack of edible food she has been finding everyday. The thinness of her body seem to make her already impressive assets seem even more so. Coming back to her hair, she noticed that it seemed to have lost a lot of its shine, it was frizzy with split ends that hung like a halo around her head.<p>[My god. I was dying - and I didn't even realize it.] Ranma agonized to herself.<p>She felt like she looked like hell.<p>"You clean up rather well."<p>Ranma turned to the voice, and for the first time got a good look at the woman who brought her here.<p>Studying her host for the first time she, she noted that she was not a fighter. The short, even shorter that Ranma's girl form, snow haired woman seemed to radiate and quite power, a peaceful quite power. A power that one respected whether you were consciously aware of it or not. Piercing hazel eyes set deep within a oval face shined with an inner determination that burned all their own. Ranma decided that her host, if need be could be a force to be reckoned with.<p>After examining Akiko, Ranma suddenly feeling uncomfortable staring at her host, inverted her eyes, studying the tiled floor instead.<p>Come, child. Let's get you dressed and then get you something to eat.<p>******************<p>Akiko watched Ranma eat, she never seen anyone eat quite like this before. Ranma was carefully inspecting almost every bite of food before it entered her mouth, once there it would disappear almost without chewing. Then the next bite would be picked up examined carefully then devoured. Akiko wonder what Ranma was looking for in the food, then remembering where she found her, it all came into sharp focus.<p>Ranma finished the last bite of her food, after careful inspection.<p>Thank you for feeding me.  Ranma said softly from her seat, adding in a bow.<p>That's quite alright, dear.  Akiko answered,  Michiko, would you please be a sweetie and take care of the plates, just leave them by the sink, I'll take care of them tomorrow.<p>The plates were then cleared.<p>"So tell me  Akiko Began, "how did come to be in our dumpster?"<p>By that time Michiko had returned and reclaimed her seat.<p>Ranma was sitting at one of the tables in the restaurant with Akiko in front and Michiko to her right. She was wearing the barrowed dress, that surprising fit her well, considering Michiko was taller and more filled out than her. Ranma's long red locks were tied into a long ponytail with the refastened dragon's whisker. She didn't really want to make eye contact with anyone - she found from past experiences that usually causes - problems.<p>"Ah... I was hungry."<p>"Yes sweetie, but how did you end up there?" Akiko prompted.<p>"Ah... I ... was disowned." Ranma answer so quietly that it barely heard.<p>"But why?" Michiko blurted out, earning a glare of her grandmother which she shrunk back from.<p>"You don't have to answer that, child. It was rather rude -" another glare aimed at Michiko, "of her to ask that."<p>"It's all right you have a right to know," blabbed Ranma, "cleaning me and feeding me like you did. It was because I failed - It's because - I just didn't want to get married."<p>"Married? At your age? How old are you anyway?" Michiko blurted out again, earning another glare which, she ignored.<p>"I take it was an arranged marriage?" Akiko asked, deciding to overlook Michiko outburst.<p>"Yeah, something like that." Ranma replied, still staring at the table top.  Um... I'm sixteen.  answering Michiko's question.<p>"Your family threw you out over that? What kind of people are they?" Michiko ranted.<p>"Michiko, please control yourself," Akiko admonished, she knew Michiko can be very enthusiastic over anything she saw as an injustice.<p>"Yes, Grandma." she respectfully said, turning to Ranma with a slight bow, "My apologies."<p>"No, it's all right." Ranma softly spoke, still looking at a spot on the table.<p>I take it then, the man your parents wanted you to marry was not to your liking.  Akiko stated.<p>He was my father's training partner.<p>How old is he?  Michiko asked, Akiko sighed.<p>His youngest daughter from his deceased wife is my age.<p>What? They expected you to marry someone as old as your own father? What in the hell were they thinking?  Michiko exploded.<p>Michiko, you will control yourself or you will be asked to leave. I will not accept that kind of behavior, especially in front of a guest.  When Akiko locked those steely hazel eyes against the blazing hazel eyes of her grand daughter, Michiko wilted.<p>After that storm had passed, all was quite at the table. Ranma, still looking at the table top hadn't moved or said anything about Michiko's outburst. Taking a deep breath, Akiko sat with her hands on the table in front of her. Studying the girl across from her.<p>"Do you feel like talking about it? I understand if you don't." Akiko gently said.<p>Ranma looked up for the first time since she sat down. Looking into Akiko piercing hazel eyes she felt several different things going on. In those eyes she sensed strength, she felt warmth, she knew that those eyes let her, a stranger to Akiko, know that everything would work out.<p>"It's a long story. A long and unbelievable story." Ranma mutter, lower her glaze back to the table top.<p>"We have plenty of time, and we're used to strange going on's here. Why there're even some magic girls that run around here in short skirts that fight and kill demons all of the time." Akiko reassured.<p>Ranma blinked, blinked at the magic girl statement, then shrugged her shoulders.<p>"Okay, first you have to remember I was born a boy...<p>...then Ranma proceeded to tell the story of her life, from she curse until the present.<p>Many hours later...<p>"... then I lost the kettle, Herb didn't get it either - I hope he's suffering too..."<p>Still later...<p>"... and that's when you found me." Ranma finished with a long exhale.<p>By this time it was well into the night, the sounds of the busy city were long muted by the night.<p>"Wow. That's pretty unbelievable." Michiko said.<p>"Told you. " Ranma replied, not looking up.<p>""I mean really unbelievable."<p>"I believed you when you told me about some magic girls running around, what's so unbelievable about what I said?" Ranma whispered, it would have been taken as a challenge if the speaker hadn't said it so meekly.<p>"Well, we just never heard a tale quite like yours." Akiko softly added.<p>"Feh, If you doubt it, then go visit Nerima sometime and ask around, they'll tell you." Ranma said somewhat softly, yet defensively at the same time.<p>"We're not questioning your word dear," Akiko said, "it's just you seemed to live through enough problems for four lifetimes."<p>"Yeah, on top of having a slave trader for a father and a homicidal manic for a mother." Michiko snorted.<p>"Michiko!" Akiko said, not quite as softly as before.<p>"Well what would you call a man who would sell his only child for a bowel of rice and a fish...?"<p>"And two pickles." Ranma added, wanting the tale completed.<p>... and what about that crap about being  a men among men'?  Michiko ranted on,  what the hell does that mean? Most guys I know who consider themselves  men among men' are nothing more than walking sperm donors.<p>Michiko, that's enough.  Akiko reprimanded, as Ranma turned alittle green from that last comment.<p>Michiko sat there and fumed about the strange girl, no boy's, -no better make that girl's plight. Michiko was not unaware of the weird going on's in other wards, but this is the first time she came face-to-face with someone claiming to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the weird going on's.<p>Akiko sighed heavily, Michiko can be so difficult at times. Tapping her fingertips on the table top, many things crossed her mind concerning Ranma, after a moment of thought she asked,<p>Ranma, do you consider yourself a boy or a girl?<p>Ranma, still with her eyes on the table, fidgeted in her seat. This was not a question she wanted to answer, most of all to herself. It scared her like nothing else could, most importantly how will these two people in the room react to her answer. She could lie of course, but Akiko's presence ruled that out. There was something about her that made you trust her, and lying to her would just be plain wrong. Taking a deep breath Ranma answered,<p>You gotta understand, I was born a boy, I should live and die a boy.  Ranma sighed , then continued,  If your were to ask that question before I - before I was thrown, out I would have yelled at the top of my lungs,  I'm a guy, dammit!  and probably go out and do something really stupid to prove it.<p>How about now?<p>Ranma's head fell even lower,<p>I.. I really don't know anymore. I didn't really think about it when I... I was on the streets. It didn't matter. For so long now it just didn't seem to matter. I don't really think that I'm a real girl because I was raised to be a man but, I don't think of myself as real man anymore because... well how many men get periods?<p>I see... you say your stuck like this?  Akiko reaffirmed.<p>Ranma nodded, still looking at the table.<p>Well then, we'll just treat you as Ranma. Neither a girl or a boy, just you. Do you understand?<p>Ranma shook her head, that spot on the table was sure interesting.<p>Well, what I trying to say there is more to a person than what sex you are.  deciding to change the subject.  Where have you been staying? Where have you been sleeping exactly?<p>Ranma, head still down and looking at the same spot on the table, bowed her head lower.<p>Um...There's a bridge near here I sleep under, I don't even know the name of the street. I know it crosses a river. All the good spaces are probably gone by now though, I'll probably have to find a spot in the park at this hour.<p>Michiko eyes widen at that, she forgot about that, about Ranma living under a bridge.<p>Why not stay here? we can -  Akiko started before being cut off.<p>No, please.  Ranma said softly, lifting her head for maybe the third time during the whole conversation,  You have been too kind to me as it is. I couldn't impose on you anymore - I should get my things and just go.  the she added quietly  I don't want to be trouble.<p>With that Ranma went back to examining the table top.<p>Akiko regard Ranma some more, realizing that beneath this withdrawn, shy girl was a person who still had a certain amount of pride. Akiko knew that pride can help a person succeed greatly in life, but uncontrolled it can also be a great undoing. With that thought Akiko acted,<p>I'm not talking about charity, Ranma. I'm talking about offering you a job here with me and Michiko. We do need help around here during the dinner rush - I'm sure your working as a waitress would more than cover room and board.<p>A... job?  that ideal, that dream seemed so unreal to Ranma now.<p>Yes and you can keep whatever tips you make. Save up some money, do things.<p>Yeah! That's a great ideal Grandma.  Michiko interjected.  We get so swamped here that afterwards I have to stay up late just do homework. Ranma can even come to school with me and after that we can come back here and work.  Michiko added excitably.<p>Ranma frowned to herself,  I'm a martial artist, I don't need to go to school. I don't really have the need for it.<p>Is that you - or your father talking?  Akiko questioned, before Ranma could think of a response,  And outside of protecting yourself, how far has your martial arts gotten you?<p>Ranma looked up from the table for the forth time and her mouth doing a good imitation of a fish out of water, gasping.<p>I see...  Akiko stated dryly.<p>Ranma slummed further into her chair.<p>It was true, outside of protecting herself from the perverts on the street or the perverts in business suits, her martial arts hasn't really done anything for her. Looking back, martial arts was probably to root of many of her problems (along with her father's actions), or so it seem to her at that moment. Can her whole life's problems be caused by the very thing, the very last thing she truly felt she had left in her life? It was a disturbing and disquieting thought, that left her with a vague feeling of being betrayed.<p>After a moment of silence.<p>I'm sorry.  Ranma said for the umpteenth time that evening.<p>Nothing to be sorry for sweetie. You just have to realize depending on one thing to get by in life is foolish.<p>Another moment of silence.<p>"How can I attend school?" Ranma asked, "I was not that great of a student, I can't even get my records and-"<p>"Let me worry about that, dear" Akiko interrupted with an upheld hand, "You'll find if you live in one place long enough, you have people to call upon to help with little things like this."<p>"I don't know what to say" Ranma said quietly.<p>"Try thank you, dear."<p>"Oh! I'm sorry." Ranma said looking up wide eyed, then bowed, with her face almost touching the top of the table, "Thank you.'<p>"You're welcome dear.  Looking at a clock on the wall,  Oh, just look at the time. We had better get to bed. Come along I'll show you where you'll be sleeping.  Akiko gently said.<p>Then she silently sighed, wishing that Ranma would stop apologizing every-time she or someone said something.<p>********************<p>Following Akiko and Michiko out of the dinning and back up the stairs. Ranma climbed up to a much smaller second floor where the living quarters were. Upon reaching the top she noticed a flight of stairs that would have lead to a third floor was in place but the top where it would enter the next floor was blocked off. A closet space was set underneath where the stairs went up, Akiko paused and opened the door and took out a futon, a thin pillow and a blanket and passed them off to Michiko, Ranma's hands being full with her pack.<p>Akiko then lead around the stairwell to where there was an inset area with a door on the left-hand side of it, the wooden floor was cover by a small throw rug. Here, she and Michiko removed there shoes and placed them on the rug, Ranma followed their example.<p>Akiko explained off handily while she was removing her shoes,<p>"The family has owned this building for years, so we rented the top three floors and part of this one to the clothing store next door when they expanded. Perhaps when you get a bit of money saved up you can replace - some of your more worn garments."<p>Walking down the narrow hall Akiko continued to give Ranma the layout of the second floor,<p>"This door,  she said while waving at the door next to where they left their shoes,  is to the storage room for the restaurant, we keep extra tables and chairs and other goods in case they are ever needed. Across from that is the water closet, and next to that is, as you know, the bathing room."<p>Ranma mentally took note of her surroundings.<p>"Across from the that," Akiko continued "is Michiko room." Ranma noted the sticker laden door, "and next to hers in my room."<p>Going all the way to the end of the hall, across from Akiko's room, was an open area that apparently serve as a living room. The interior had a low table, TV and book shelves filled with books, manga, and other magazines. The far wall, near the corner of the room was a window with the bamboo blinds drawn, along the same wall near the opposite corner was another blind covered window, but atop of that one was an air conditioning unit.<p>"Here is where you'll be sleeping, dear. It may not be much, but I'm sure you'll find it comfortable."<p>Michiko moved the table off to the side and undid the strap on the futon, unrolling it across the floor. Piling the blanket and pillow on top the the futon she turned to Ranma and gave her goodnights. She then departed for her room.<p>Akiko placed a hand on Ranma's shoulder, Ranma involuntarily flinched and mutter an apology under her breath.<p>"It's quite alright, child. You have been through enough, but you're safe here. Have a pleasant night."<p>With that Ranma was alone, but not alone. She unfurled the blanket and changed out of the barrowed dress and into a barrowed night shirt. Laying out on the futon, [So soft] she thought she rolled to her side, keeping her pack near her as was her habit - she drifted off to sleep.<p>**************<p>She was spinning, spinning, spinning, around and around.<p>She was being held by something - no - someone as swaying was added to her spinning. There was no fear here, only a feeling of gaiety, she felt herself laugh - It's been so long! When was last time she danced like this - it seemed like ages. Her partner lifted his hand and she walked through a spin, all the while keeping the spin from when they were joined, a spin within a spin. They rejoined and swayed and spun as one. Her heart soared.<p>She laughed some more. Her laughter sounding like bells to her ears.<p>Her faceless partner wearied. Another was waiting, this time a faceless girl with long ponytails - she didn't mind. The two girls joined in a dancers hold as Ranma took the lead, and continued the dance with her new partner. They continued to spin and dance across a vast featureless floor - she laugh some more. Her partner laughed with her. Two musical bells echoing in the dance.<p>And the music, no the feeling of music reverberated in her soul, she was so happy!<p>I wish Serenity would hold these balls more often.<p>"Ranma"<p>She look at her partner. The faceless girl kept dancing with her.<p>"Ranma"<p>Ranma was confused, her partner hadn't said anything... then who?<p>"Ranma"<p>Then like an earthquake, her world shook.<p>*********************<p>"Ranma" Michiko said as she gently shook the sleeping girl.<p>Ranma's eyes cracked open and then her whole body seem to disappeared under Michiko hand startling her. When Michiko regained her wits, she looked up to see Ranma standing in a defensive position.<p>"Ah... are you alright?" Michiko ventured.<p>Ranma quickly regained her senses and dropped her guarded stance.<p>"Sorry about that. You sca - scared me."<p>"It's okay, breakfast is going to be ready soon. Why don't you get clean up - I'll meet you down stairs." Michiko said cheerfully<p>"Ah... okay. I'll see you downstairs." she replied in a tiny voice.<p>Michiko left for the stairs while Ranma folded the blanket she was using and proceeded to roll up and tie the futon. She then redressed into the dress she wore yesterday.<p>[What the hell kind of dream was that?] she pondered while doing her task, [I never danced, at least not like that. And who in the hell is Serenity?] she shrugged, [Maybe living on the streets has messed me up more than I thought.]<p>With a shake of her head Ranma dismissed the dream and placed her sleeping items in the far corner of the room, near the window behind the book case. Lifting the bamboo blind, she took a peek at what the day would look like. It was very early. She couldn't see the sky from her vantage point but she could tell it was early, all she saw was the back of the buildings across the way in the alley and the roof of the first floor with it's many pipes, vents and chimneys sticking through. [The second floor isn't as deep as the first.] she thought.<p>Some birds shooting by the window distracted her as one landed on the roof in front of the window that she was looking out of, the bird the proceeded strut around and peck at seemly random areas on the graveled roof. The big black bird moved it's head in a jerky way as it looked around before taking finally taking flight again. Ranma watched it go, then with a sigh, turn to clean up for the day.<p>Overall, it looked like it was going to be a beautiful day out side.<p>Trotting down the hall to the bathing room, she knocked carefully on the door before entering, using the sink below the selves she washed her hands and face, then using a conveniently place towel, dried off.<p>The running water trigger something in her. [Great. Now I gotta use the toilet.]<p>Exiting the bathing room, she reentered the hall and knocked gently on adjacent door and waited. Hearing no response she carefully opened the door and peek in. It was empty. Entering the water-closet, she idly noted that it was a Japanese style toilet, not the western type she had been use to seeing and using in many of the public restrooms. Didn't make any real difference to her, it was a simple detail that she noted.<p>After she was through, she headed down the stairs.<p>******************<br/>After eating breakfast.<p>Michiko, at Akiko's request, went and cleared the table and took the dishes to the back into the kitchen.<p>"Now that you will be staying with us," Akiko began in a businesslike way, "we need to talk about what kind of experience you have? Have you ever worked as a waitress before?"<p>"Yes ma'am," Ranma nodded as she replied "remember last night when I told you about the old ghoul who locked me in my curse form with the c-cats tongue pressure point?"<p>Akiko nodded, she vaguely remembered, Ranma told so many tales last night that is was hard to remember all the details of all of them.<p>Ranma continued,<p>"I worked as a waitress there to try to get my cure, the cure for the c-cats tongue. I had lots of experience waiting tables and with the old ghoul around she made sure I learned, eh, I also managed to get alot of speed training there, too." the last said with alittle touch of pride.<p>Akiko raised a eyebrow, but decided not to ask.<p>"What about kitchen work, any experience there?" Akiko inquired in a businesses-like way.<p>"Yes ma'am, I did lots of cooking on the road, and some back at", pause, "where we settled for awhile."<p>"Excellent, Ranma, you seem to have everything we want for help around here. You and Michiko will share the same shift. It starts as soon as you both are home from school and ends when clean up is done. Would that be alright with you?"<p>Ranma looked and Akiko for a second, for what felt like a long second, before she looked down at the table top and answer,<p>"Yes ma'am," Ranma bowed, "that would be fine. I'm sorry if I seem rude, it's just that," sigh "you have been so generous to me, a complete stranger to you. I'm not use to being treated so.. so... nice."<p>"That's quite alright, sweetie" Akiko said, dropping her 'business voice', "Since there is no school today why don't you wander around the building and get use to where everything is. Michiko can show you around the area some, once she finishes her homework."<p>"Do I get to work lunch on weekends?" Ranma asked.<p>"No dear, I hired a some of the college girls to help out during lunch. They take night courses up the way and between the four of them working part-time we have the lunch crowd pretty well covered."<p>"Oh" Ranma said in a small voice, still looking at the table.<p>"Ranma" Akiko prodded gently.<p>"Yes ma'am."<p>"Please," Akiko said even more gently, "look at me when we talk. I won't bite."<p>Ranma slowly raised her head, meeting Akiko eyes with hers. She felt uncomfortable and vulnerable.<p>"I'm sorry." Ranma whispered.<p>"And please," Akiko said gently and yet with a firm undercurrent in her voice, "Stop apologizing every-time someone says something to you. You have nothing to be sorry for." Akiko eyes were almost pleading.<p>Ranma swallowed hard.<p>"I'm sor- I mean yes ma'am."<p>"And you can call me Granny, all my friends do."<p>Ranma smiled thinly at this.<p>"Yes, Granny."<p>******************<p>Akiko look at Ranma.<p>Before you do anything though, we should work on getting you presentable.<p>Ranma looked down at the dress she was wearing, then looked up with a puzzled look.<p>No dear, the dress is fine, but we have to do something about your hair. You sit right there while I get the scissors.  she then bustled off to retrieved the said item.<p>Ranma fidgeted, it wasn't like she had never gotten a hair cut before. It was just that it had been so long that it seemed more like a novelty, that she was the only word she could think to describe it.<p>Soon Akiko return and preceded to work on Ranma's hair.<p>********************<p>Looking at herself in the hand mirror Ranma had to admit, she looked much better and somehow, that made her feel better in a way she couldn't put her finger on. Her hair was still longer than before, shoulder length, but that didn't really bother her.<p>Michiko appeared as Akiko finished up.<p>Grandma, can I take Ranma around the neighborhood? You know show her around?  she asked coyly.<p>Have you finished your homework?  Akiko replied while working the last to the knots out of Ranma's newly trimmed locks.<p>"I thought I would take Ranma out now before it got to crowded." Michiko said with pleading eyes.<p>Akiko relented, "Alright dear, but you had best be back before 1 o'clock to get cracking on your homework", she said the last somewhat sternly in a gentle sort of way,  and before you go out young lady,  this time addressing the still seated Ranma,  you need to put on a bra.<p>A - a- a bra?  Ranma stuttered out.<p>Yes, of course. You may have once had a mans body, but you need to learn how to take care of your female one now don't you?<p>Ranma was feeling a might uneasy right now, but nodded.<p>Good, now you're - very well developed, but I think I can find something.  and with that, she did.<p>********************<p>... and remember, no later than 1 o'clock.  Akiko called from the dinning room.<p>"Yes Grandma." Michiko chimed, then grabbed Ranma by the hand, "C'mon Ranma, I'll show you around the neighborhood."<p>As the girls headed for the door, Akiko thought about the problem of Ranma. How to get her into school without providing any records on her will prove difficult. She pondered this, before smiling.<p>[Yes! She would be the type who would help out in something like this.]<p>She had met her about three years ago and had kept in contact with her off and on through the years. Such a nice young lady. Happens to work at the school where her grand daughter goes and kept her informed when Michiko behavior gets alittle too much for the teachers to handle, before any official reprimand, of course.<p>[Yes, after hearing what Ranma's been through, I'm sure she would definitely want to help her out.]<p>Going upstairs and shucking her shoes her entered her room and dug through a drawer in a small burro. After rummaging around a bit she triumphantly held a scrap of paper. Donning her shoes she went through the main dinning room to the kitchen where the phone was located.<p>Dialing the number she heard it ring three times, on the forth the party she hoped to reach answer.<p>Hello the voice on the other end answered.<p>"Hello, Setsuna, It's Akiko. I hate to bother you at home and on a Sunday morning like this, but a problem has come up and..."<p>**********************<p>Michiko unlatched the door and let Ranma to the sidewalk, Ranma then waited until Michiko re-locked it behind her. Turning to take in her surroundings the sun hit Ranma in the eyes, blinding her momentarily. She had to avert her eyes and clear them.<p>When they cleared, Ranma got a good look around her.<p>This was the first time Ranma seen the front of the building that she would now call home. It was taller than she imagined, five floors, and above the entryway was a garnish sign in english with the Japanese words underneath. "Yoshi Cafe' American" . Looking about the neighborhood, Ranma noted that the streets were narrower than the ones in Nermina and the sidewalks were abit wider. An empty bike rack spanned the area just short of where the front door of the restaurant was and almost to the doors to the clothing store next door which was named "Team Leader Clothes and Fashions".<p>The front of the clothing store was a riot of colorful banners, poster-board with handmade scrawlings and professional looking signs. Each proclaiming things along the lines of: "Clothing New and Used", "Latest Styles - Now Here" and "Clothing for that Retro You". It was huge. It looked like the kind of place young people would go to shop because it was cool to shop there, and cheap to boot. Other people would shop there just because it was cheap. Ranma's eyes could trace where the building housing the clothing store cross over into the building that housed the restaurant was. It did take the top three floor plus about half of the second, where she now resided. The Yoshi family must be doing very well, renting the unused parts of their building to their neighbors.<p>[... depending on one thing to get by in life is foolish.] Ranma thought to herself as she remembered the words of Akiko from the night before.<p>The other side of the restaurant, the building looked like a multi layer cake, each floor seemed to have its own shop that decorated the exterior faces in its own individual way. A bike shop occupied the ground floor, a shoe store on the second, the third had no sign-age so maybe it was unused or maybe people lived there. The forth had a video rentals and the top floor had electronics new and used. This building too had a long bike rack in front which did have a few bikes placed here and there.<p>The whole neighborhood followed the same pattern.<p>It was still early so the sidewalks were uncrowded, Michiko having successfully put her homework off to later, began to show Ranma around.<p>*****************<p>Walking slightly behind Michiko, Ranma was taking it all in. She had been to shopping districts before, but she would usually go in with a purpose, find what she need and then get the hell out. She never liked the crowds and since living like she had been, she liked them even less. Too many perverts hide in crowds.<p>Turning into a wider street, Michiko started pointing out all of the landmarks.<p>"Over there is the ice cream shop where I hang with my friends sometimes and down the road a ways is the the grocery store grandma and I do are shopping. They have some of the best frozen pork buns you can buy. The library is now the next block over, I'll show you that later. There is a temple or shrine nearby too, if you are in to that kinda thing..."<p>Michiko went on describing in detail where everything was and how to get here or there. Where find the best shopping and who had the best deals, where the bus stops were and other points of interests.<p>Now walking side by side down the wide sidewalk, Ranma took it all in with great interest. Ranma for her part just listened and and only spoke to ask questions to clarify where something was. Michiko pointed out the school where she went and hopefully, Ranma would soon be going. From their vantage, all that was seen was the clock tower that seems to be prevalent in every high school Ranma has seen.<p>****************<p>Walking along the street that bordered a river Ranma felt an uneasy feel creep into her gut, and crawl up to her heart. Michiko who was talking about the various personel goings-on's in the area , noticed something was amiss with Ranma when she started to slow down and stopped responding to her questions. Michiko was growing concerned. Finally halting and turning to her new friend she gently reached for her,<p>"Ranma, what's the matter - you seem troubled all the sudden." Michiko asked.<p>"Ah... It's nothing." Ranma said shyly looking down at the ground as she tried not to flinch as Michiko touched her shoulder.<p>"C'mon Ranma, you can tell me. We've been talking most of the time we were out, having a good time. Now you suddenly close up on me. What's the problem?" Michiko prodded, though not as gently as Akiko would've.<p>"That bridge." Ranma replied finally, pointing to the structure in the near distant, "That bridge, was my home for I don't know how long." looking up at Michiko, "It seems so weird seeing it like this, that's all. I mean it's only been one night, but still-" Ranma trailed off.<p>Seeing that her new friend was getting depressed, Michiko did the only thing she could think of, something that helped her when she was depressed.<p>"C'mon Ranma. Let's get some ice cream, my treat to celebrate you starting work tomorrow."<p>Ranma was about to object, but the blazing smile that Michiko greeted her with when she looked up brook no argument. Besides ice cream sounded good too.<p>*****************<p>Ranma and Michiko was on their return walk, side-by-side with Ranma on the inside, next to the buildings. Suddenly out of the arcade they were about to pass came a blur that rushed out and collided with Ranma. As both bodies headed for the ground, Ranma caught herself and her unknown assailant. Instinctively realizing this was not an attack, Ranma pulled the other person close, and by spinning around on their joined axis and managed to right herself as well as the person she was clinging to. The momentum of the spin set them up for another three-quarter spin before Ranma was able to compensate for the inertia.<p>The spinning had a touch of sway to it.<p>And she remembered how she loved to dance.<p>The blonde hair girl that crashed into Ranma was in front apologizing and bowing and talking in hyper-speed.<p>"Oh,I'msosorry! willgetmadatme,thenI'.Bye."<p>The next thing Ranma knew, she was looking at a cloud of dust and the quickly retreating figure of a girl sporting long twin ponytails that flapped in the breeze as she ran. Ranma stood there wondering what the hell just happened.<p>"Ranma, are you alright?" Michiko inquired with concern. She had seen the whole thing happen and how both girls avoided ending up on the ground was beyond her.<p>"Yeah, I'm okay, let's get - home - before Granny gets mad for us being late." Ranma said, saying the word "home" with a certain amount of reverence while trying to ignore a tickle of memory in the back of her mind.<p>They stepped up their pace as they walked back to the restaurant, with light banter being exchanged between them. In the back Ranma's mind however,she kept wondering back to the tickle in her mind: the memory of dancing, and loving it.<p>************<p>As soon as they got home Michiko hurried upstairs to do her long awaited homework. Ranma was about to follow her up when Akiko called to her.<p>"Ranma." Akiko began, "I have some good news. I was able to get you into Juuban High. I called an acquaintance of mine that works there and she said that she could work everything out on her end."<p>"Th-That's great." Ranma said [I think].<p>"Good, now she said that they had some uniforms that were donated for needy students and if you definitely qualify. Get there early enough, she can help fit you with one."<p>"I don't need a uniform."<p>"It's required at this school, I'm sure you will like it." Akiko stated.<p>Ranma nodded at this, not really thinking about questioning the need for a uniform.<p>"Granny?"<p>"Yes Ranma?"<p>"If I get up early enough," Ranma asked quietly, "can I clear an area down here to practice my art before breakfast? I promise to put everything back where I got it when I'm finished. The art may not have gotten me far in life, but I like it - and it's all that I have left from my old life."<p>Akiko thought about the request before answering.<p>"Of course, sweetie. But you have to promise to clean up any mess you make and you will have to pay for anything you break."<p>"Yes ma'am." Ranma said and she nodded in agreement.<p>"... and also you have to promise to keep your grades up once you start school tomorrow."<p>Ranma looked at the floor," Yes ma'am." [Darn!]<p>Akiko placed her hand under Ranma's chin, raising her head.<p>"It won't be so bad, dear." Akiko said while looking at Ranma in the eye, "Just think of it as motivation. Work before play." She finished with a kind smile.<p>Looking at those eyes, Ranma couldn't help but agree. With that, Ranma ascended the stairs and explored the smaller upstairs living quarters that has been the Yoshi family home. It didn't take long. Going into the living room she had slept in the night before, she noticed that the blinds were open and afforded her a grand view of the back of the buildings across the alley that she noted earlier that morning.<p>Sitting on the floor by the opened window, (the Yoshi's didn't have any chairs upstairs, except for those in storage) she rested her elbow on the windowsill and propped her head up with her hand. Lost in thought.<p>Her life had changed - again. First when she was disowned, the hell of life on the streets and now when she had the good fortune to meet the Yoshi's. She tried to think back, just to the other day, around this time and what she might have been doing, and came up with nothing.<p>Her life on the streets were not even worth remembering, but she knew she would ever forget it. Somethings you couldn't forget, others you hoped to. Training for as long as she felt like it had been nice, the foraging for food was unpleasant but necessary and some of the men...<p>... Ranma shudder at the memory of that. She actually thought about doing - "that" - with men, for money to live on. Even if she didn't actually do  it , that one moment of weakness in her mind still shamed her.<p>If the dumpster that she had usually dug through for dinner wasn't unexpectedly locked, and if it weren't for that damn cat that prevented her from going to her  other sources , she might have never venture down this particular alley, to the dumpster of the only restaurant on this part of the block. Who knows what would have eventually happened to her?<p>Ranma sighed, and shifted her position resting on her crossed arms upon the sill. Staring out at nothing and thinking about how her life has changed in a few short hours.<p>And about dancing.<p>And how she ended up here.<p>It had to be fate.<p>[Maybe somebody up there finally likes me.], she thought before she rose to find something to do.<p>_<p>Authors ending whine:<p>Here it is, a bran new chapter. I am trying to get them alittle more refined before I post them, but this is all still pretty new to me. Sometimes I think of something like  Oh yeah, I forgot to put this in  or  crap, I could have written that part better .<p>I hope I get better in writing in general as time goes on and having less of what happened to the last chapter (two beta's posted). My  story line outline  is up too a theoretical chapter 9, but I have no ideal how the actual chapters will break down. You know how in a outline you have a number 1 and item A), B), C) etc. under it? Well this chapter only had two items under it and it took awhile to cover all of the bases on it.<p>The next chapter has 7 main items and 10 minor sub items. Maybe I'll break that into two chapters, or try to edit it down some.<p>I'm going to be playing fast and loose with the Sailor Moon universe, but hope to keep everyone in some resemblance of in-character.<p>Man this isn't easy - but so far it's been fun.<p></p>
