</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma-kun and co…nor Akane, nor Ukyou, nor Ryoga, nor Shampoo, nor Cologne, nor Kasumi, nor Nabiki, so on and so forth. I do own Ikuyo, Kiyoja, Koyaga, Ryuukuyo, Lo Mein, and Kaira.</p>Chapter 12: I'm Sorry, Akane<p>Ranma opened his eyes slowly to be greeted by the overpowering smell of burning herbs and something roughly matching Akane's cooking. He sat up slowly and looked around. He was in his room. His blanket slipped to his lap as he looked over to his father. Genma was snoring and biting his pillow as usual, muttering something about free food and such. He stood and stretched, not an ache in his body.</p><p>Putting on some clothes, he walked down the hallway and into the dining room where Soun was reading the paper and Nabiki was turning pages in a colorful magazine. She wore around the house clothes so he guessed there was no school. The distinct smell of Akane's cooking brought him to the kitchen where his arranged 'fiancé' hummed as she stirred a bowl of something. It didn't look like the correct thickness to be anything edible and yet she seemed not to notice. A time rang and she placed down the bowl. She went eagerly toward the oven and opened it. Ranma smiled slightly as he saw the excitement growing on her face. She pulled out the tray and smiled as the round balls of dough revealed themselves to be perfectly brown and edible looking.</p><p>He took a step forward to say something but his voice didn't come.</p><p>She placed the tray on the counter and pocked it with a chopstick. It deflated in an instant wafting off an enormously gagging smell.</p><p>Ranma put a hand to his nose to block out the smell. She frowned and nit her eyebrows in frustration as she dumped them into the garbage can at her feet. She ran a hand through her hair and stopped short as her glanced toward Ranma. Her hand clutched her stomach and she started sputtering.</p><p>Ranma ran over to help her and when he reached out to touch her his arm fell through. By now her sputtering had turned to coughing up blood and small puddle formed at her feet.</p><p>"Akane…" his minds voice whispered. "Akane, please don't die." It grew louder. "Akane!" he was screaming she couldn't hear him.</p><p>No one was coming to save her, help her in the illness that was taking her over. She collapsed in her own pool of blood.</p><p>"AKANE!"</p><p>"Akane!" Ranma jumped up out of his futon.</p><p>"Ranma-kun, be careful." Ikuyo's voice said quietly. Her voice was weak and frail sounding.</p><p>He glanced over at her. She was in traditional clothes of a Chinese noblewoman. She seemed depressed about something.</p><p>"Ikuyo…how are feeling?" he asked awkwardly.</p><p>"Better, a lot better. Kaira is…I need to go back to China for something. I won't be back for a while. I would really wish for you and Akane-chan to come as well but…in the state she's in…I don't want to risk her dying."</p><p>"I'm back!" a voice said loudly.</p><p>Ranma jumped as Kaira set down a tray of strong smelling herbs. "Oh, your awake!" she yelled.</p><p>"Keep it down, Kaira." Ikuyo whined as she covered her nose from the stench.</p><p>"Sorry…oh dear. You're awake. It's going to be terrible for you to take these herbs if you're awake." The girl put a finger to her lips. "Ah!" she pulled out a little hammer and clonked him on the head, knocking the skilled martial artist unconscious.</p><p>Ranma entered darkness once again. It was a calm darkness though. Nothing happened, no nightmares, no dreams, nothing…well…that didn't last.</p><p>He felt something slip into his hand. He looked downward into the darkness to the see the wooden floors of the dojo. His hand came into focus to reveal another intertwined with it. His gaze slowly traveled upward as it covered over a yellow cotton sleeve and a body clothed as well in yellow with the blue pattern of stars and moons. His face finally reached the top to see Akane leaning over him, her face dripping with tears.</p><p>"Ranma! Ranma don't leave! You can't! Ranma!" she was yelling but her voice only sounded like a faint whisper, so distanced and far. "Ranma!"</p><p>"I-I'm sorry, A-Akane. I couldn't…p-protect y-you from the c-curse." He whispered his thoughts. It hurt to speak.</p><p>"What are you talking about, idiot?" she laughed but then her face slipped and she was crying once again. "Ranma…I lov-."</p><p>"AHHH!" he jumped once again. He was panting and covered in sweat.</p><p>"Oh my, he came to even quicker then before." Kaira's voice sounded from behind him.</p><p>"Ranma, you'll hurt yourself." Ikuyo said as she pulled him into a sitting position again.</p><p>"H-How's Akane?" he asked shakily.</p><p>"She's still out of it. That fall knocked a lot out of her." Ikuyo said.</p><p>"She fell?"</p><p>"It the pond, yes, after I caught you. I fished her out but…she hasn't come to since. We have to work fast if we want to cure her." Ikuyo rubbed her arm subconsciously and stared glassy eyed at the floor.</p><p>Ranma grabbed her by the shoulders. "How do we cure her?" he asked seriously.</p><p>"It's an herb in China. That's why I'm sending Ikuyo back to the capitol. The herb is in the hands of a very powerful empress." Kaira said as she stirred a weird concoction and dished it into a small cup. She lifted the unconscious Akane upward a bit and put the cup to her parted lips, emptying the concoction down her throat.</p><p>Ranma sighed as he turned his eyes away. It hurt too much to watch.</p><p>"Ranma…I'm so sorry I got you all mixed up in my problems. I'm so sorry…" Ikuyo said softly. "But you have to help me. Even if we have to take Akane-chan. Onegai, Ranma-kun?" she grabbed his hands.</p><p>Ranma stared at his childhood friend. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears and it made his heart tear. She was blaming herself for all the things that had happened. "M-Maybe…" he whispered uncharacteristically.</p><p>Ranma sat next to the still unconscious Akane and thought. <i>If we go back to China…maybe we can find a quicker way of curing Akane</i>, he thought<i>, and maybe we can stop at Jusenkyo.</i></p><p>A smile crept across his lips and he laughed quietly.</p><p>Akane shifted and he stared at her quickly.</p><p>"Ra-Ra-Ranma…he-help…me…" her voice trailed off as her face filled with pain.</p><p>Ranma held her hand hesitantly. "I'm so sorry, Akane. I'm sorry…" he closed his eyes. "Why'd they pick you? Why didn't…why didn't they pick me or somethin'?"</p><p>"Are you ready, Ranma?" Ikuyo asked as she stood near the gates of the dojo in her traditional Chinese outfit from earlier that morning.</p><p>Ranma hoisted Akane farther up his back and walked out toward her. "Yeah."</p><p>"Cheer up, Ranma. Akane's only exhausted. If we're lucky and she stays unconscious for the whole trip then we won't have to deal with those hands a hers." She winked and turned on her heel. "I booked us a space on a ship. No use swimmin' across the oceans and seas just to meet the empress, ne?"</p><p>"Right."</p><p>Ikuyo jumped up onto the roof of the gate to the dojo and ran down. Ranma quickly followed after her flowing many layers.</p><p>I'll help you, Akane. I swear it! Don't give up! I'll save you…</p><p>"Mama…Mama…Mama…"</p><p>"What is it, Ryuukuyo?" Kiyoja yelled down at the young boy.</p><p>"Mama, I'm sorry. I failed you and you…you had to bring me back." He sniffed again.</p><p>"It's Lo Mein's fault. LO MEIN!"</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>"Lo Mein?"</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>"Where is that damned ninja?" she tapped her nails against the wood of her chair.</p><p>"Ma'am, we have captured the Empress as ordered, as well as the ninja from Nerima, Sasuke." A young girl bowed in front of Kiyoja. "Ikuyo, Ranma-san, Akane-san, and Kaira are heading this way." She added.</p><p>"Miyo, attack them. Stall for time until I've set up…my plans."</p><p>"Hai, Kiyoja-sama." The girl lifted her head.</p><p>"Uh…take the form of Ranma-san. This will be quite interesting." Kiyoja stood; her long thin white dress flowed to her black Chinese shoes. She wore a red over coat and the white dress over lapped at the top. A yellow sash was around her waist and a white shimmering cloth was draped around her shoulders.</p><p>Three groups of woman marched in and placed the Empress in her nightgown at the feet of the ice sorceress.</p><p>"Kiyoja-sama." They all bowed to one knee, their various weapons' handles tapped to the ground, their tips in the air.</p><p>Kiyoja swept passed Miyo, the now exact copy of girl Ranma, and knelt in front of the Empress. She tilted up the woman's pale face and swiped away some of her black hair. She pressed her lips to the unconscious woman's own and started changing. Her hair turned to black and her clothing was that of the Empresses own. She pulled away to leave the shriveled mess of the Empress at her dainty feet and gestured for Ryuukuyo to follow her.</p><p>"Miyo," her voice was smooth and gentle, "remember your orders. Attack Ikuyo and Ranma. Akane will do the rest." With that she swept out of the dark throne room but stopped with her hand on the handle to shut the door. "And find Lo Mein. I wish to know of her betrayal and why." She slammed the door behind her and Ryuukuyo.</p><p>"Ranma?" Ikuyo stared at the martial artist. He had been sprayed with water and was now onna Ranma. "Ranma-chan? Are you listening?"</p><p>Ranma stared off into the distance. "Do you think we'll find Akane a cure? An instant cure?"</p><p>"I'm not sure. The effects are hard to begin with. Akane-chan…she has a strong will, I can tell you that much." Ikuyo clutched the railing of the ship and stared off into the distance as Ranma was doing. "I'm so sorry, Ranma. It's my fault Akane-chan has been a target. She's been hurt so much…all because…of my own family problems." She shook with anger. "But I really don't understand why Kiyoja wants me!"</p><p>Ranma snapped her gaze to the girl. "You don't?"</p><p>"I don't! Ever since I was young girl…I was a seamstresses assistant. We would steal linen and silk cloths for her greatest works…"</p><p>*-*Flashback*-*</p><p>Young Ikuyo walked with her small hand in the palm of the seamstresses own. She wore a red over coat the buttoned down the middle and a white underlying dress that flowed down her arms. She wore her brown hair in the traditional loops all the young girls were wearing.</p><p>She skipped after the seamstress who was gently pulling her along. Her black Chinese shoes padded lightly against the gravel of the busy streets of Gonghe Qinghai, China (Near where Jusenkyo is supposed to be). She clutched the round and tall column of silk, hidden by a very gaudy red sheet with pink sequins sewed into the fabric. She shook slightly, it wasn't fun to be smuggling stolen silk from the palace. She glance up at the seamstress who was looking very casual, a learned cover-up for the nervousness that was probably wracking her body at the moment.</p><p>She sniffed as tears ran down her cheeks. Someone was following them. She could feel its eyes on the two smugglers backs.</p><p>"Mmm…Otama-san? Otama-san? Someone's…following." She whispered.</p><p>"Shh…just ignore it." Otama whispered back. "Ikuyo, let's pick up the pace."</p><p>"Hai, Otama-san."</p><p>The two turned around and headed into a dark ally. Otama opened a door inside the wall and stepped inside.</p><p>"Set it over there and I'll lock the doors. We'll stare right away, Ikuyo-chan." Otama closed the door tightly and pulled the heavy metal bolt to close the door tightly. She leaned her head against it before helping the seven-year-old Ikuyo unravel the heavy silk.</p><p>"You've grown so strong, Ikuyo. I could never pick this thing up." Otama smiled.</p><p>"Arigato." Ikuyo blushed and helped flip the spool of silk over and over until it was folded neatly on the long table.</p><p>They started sewing immediately.</p><p>While looking up at the ceiling of the seamstresses' large and elegant house, Ikuyo thought. Nothing important, just thoughts normal young girls of seven thought of. She lifted her head when a crash sounded. "Otama-san?" she called out through the darkness.</p><p>"I-Ikuyo-ch-chan. Stay in y-your r-room." Her voice stammered.</p><p>"Otama-san?"</p><p>(Translated to Japanese for easier understanding)</p><p>"Reitou Shigo!" a voice roared.</p><p>"AHHH!" a blue light rained down on Ikuyo's bed and lit up the room. She watched in the dim light as Otama shrieked and fell to the ground.</p><p>"O-Otama-san!" Ikuyo jumped up but was thrown back by a powerful hand. She was knocked against the wall of her room.</p><p>"Stay back, Ikuyo. Or else I'll be forced to put the same fate to you as your teacher." A chilling voice chided.</p><p>"Wh-Who are you?" Ikuyo asked.</p><p>The person turned revealing only piercing blue eyes. They were like ice, freezing her very soul. "I am Kiyoja, Ikuyo. Remember my beautiful name, little girl."</p><p>*-*End Flashback*-*</p><p>"Ranma-kun…I wanna ask her. She's really…starting to get on my nerves. She's…always been there with me…not in a good way. Oh, Ranma-kun! Why'd it have to be this way?" she buried her head in his shoulder.</p><p>Ranma awkwardly patted her back and tried to sooth her. "I-Iku-chan…I promise…I'll save Akane. I gotta. I can't let her down." She whispered as she looked out to toward the sea once again.</p><p>"Arigato, Ranma." Ikuyo smiled up at her.</p><p>After a few moments of staring off at sea again Ikuyo stared over at the other girl. "Ranma, I just wanna say…I love you like a brother…and a sister. I was just trying to bust Akane's chops but…I already got someone. Koyaga…" she looked back at sea. "He's so precious to me but…I really wish I could see him again."</p><p>"Koyaga? Who's that?" Ranma asked absently.</p><p>"Another martial artist."</p><p>"I should have a fight with him…" Ranma muttered as she held on tightly onto the railing.</p><p>"We're almost here, Ranma." Ikuyo said as she turned and headed for the exit where many people where gathering.</p><p>Ranma went into his cabin and picked up Akane, then followed Ikuyo off the boat.</p><p>Okay! I promised to post today and I am! So here this chapter was. Was it good? Anyway…next chapter:</p>Chapter 13: Ranma vs Ranma
