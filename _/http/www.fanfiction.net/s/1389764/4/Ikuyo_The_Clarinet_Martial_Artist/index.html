</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma ½.</p><p>A/N: Thanks for the advice my reviewers. I put Shampoo in  here! Hurry! On with the story.</p><p><b>Chapter 3: Shampoo's Anger and Chinese Journey</b></p><p>"You feel good enough to walk?" Ranma asked Ikuyo as she  weakly walked out of the house in her usual attire of her red kimono top and  her blue jeans. Her reeds where in her hands just in case she needed to throw  them quickly and her clarinet was in it's usual place on her back.</p><p>"I'm fine." She said with a smile. "A day is enough."</p><p>"I hope you don't pass out." Kasumi said as she supported  her other arm.</p><p>"Thanks Kasumi. You've been really nice." She thanked the  older girl. "Well, I gotta get back to work." She said as she stood on the  balls of her feet and tested them by jumped up and down. Then she smiled and  jogged out of the dojo.</p><p>"I hope she'll be alright." Kasumi said.</p><p>"Stupid hole. This'll take forever to fix." She said as she  inspected the large ruble filled store. The soft blue walls were untouched and  glimmered with beads of water as the ice from her stepmothers' attack melted in  the warm fall air. The golden and silver instruments were untouched as they  lied in the glass case against the wall next to eh gaping hole. She opened the  case and smiled as she looked at the instruments. They glimmered and seemed to  revive her of her illness although she knew it was still there.</p><p>"I think I may need to go back to China  against fathers' wishes." She said to herself as she picked up the golden flute  and played a light b flat. "That's good, their not damaged." She said happily  as she replaced it on its silk pad.</p><p>She stretched and walked up the stairs to her cozy  apartment. She slid open the door to her room and flopped down on the futon.  "Great to be home." She said as she held her clarinet up to light. It was taped  in the middle rather poorly and the keys were bent all the way back. "If worst  comes to worst I can use it as a sword like I used to when I didn't know any  techniques." She said with a soft laugh.</p><p>She pulled the tape off and let the pieces fall on her  chest. Tears prickled her eyes as she looked at the jagged cut. It felt like  her best friend had died. It was sort of like that. She had that clarinet for  years, playing it for the village, using it to protect their dojo, putting her  baby brother to sleep at night with the softest notes she could play, learning  how to use it in combat. She even slept with it next to her and her small cat,  Saisai. "Stupid Kiyoja. How can a demon like her disguise her true nature so  well? Innocent to the village but nasty to our family." She growled as she  remembered the death of her brother and the arrest of her mother. She will bail  her out. Her mother was one of the last living Japanese mikos' and always  cooperated. Ikuyo remembered overhearing the guards:</p><p>"That lady, Kiyo Kijota, she doesn't seem like a criminal.  How does a miko get arrested?"</p><p>"No clue. Should we ask for bail?" the other guard asked.</p><p>They had walked out of the room and to the lieutenant in  charge. From what Ikuyo heard from the rumors is that her mother was granted  bail but it was rather expensive. She had collected enough money to cross the  border and enough to bail her mother so she didn't have to worry. Alright then,  to China again.  Maybe I should bring Ranma-kun and Akane-chan with me?" she said as she wiped  away the few tears that got past her eyes. She unwrapped her bandaged arm and  walked over to the first aid kit on her dresser. She rewrapped it and brushed  her hair. She tied a white bow at the end of her hair and shivered as she felt  the curse tighten around her insides. "I'll kill her when I get home." She said  as she picked up the two pieces of her clarinet and walked out of her room and  down the stairs again.</p><p>"Hey Ukyou." Ikuyo said as she walked into Ucchan's.</p><p>"The usual?" hse asked as she already started pouring the  batter.</p><p>"Sure." She walked over to the counter and sat down. She  sighed and shivered.</p><p>"You okay?" Ukyou asked softly.</p><p>"Yeah. My stepmother." She answered simply.</p><p>"Hmm." She said as she flipped the okonomiyaki.</p><p>"Nihao, Ukyou." Shampoo said nicely as she came in.</p><p>"Ranma isn't here." Ukyou said flatly.</p><p>"Ikuyo girl!" Shampoo growled as she got into a fighting  stance.</p><p>"Hello to you too Shampoo. Long time no see." She said as  she waved to her.</p><p>"You no fight me?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"I'm injured. You wouldn't hurt an injured girl, would  you?"  Ikuyo asked as a sly smile tugged  at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>"Humph. I hate rival. What you doing in Japan?"  she asked.</p><p>"To be with my fiancé." Ikuyo answered.</p><p>Shampoo thought. "Ranma no fiancé! He's mine!" she yelled.</p><p>"Whatever." Ikuyo said as she took the last bite of her  okonomiyaki.</p><p>"You two know each other?" Ukyou asked with an amused grin.</p><p>"She is rival since childhood times." Shampoo said as she  angrily glared at Ikuyo.</p><p>"I'd fight you but I can't move as fast as before. Can't you  deal with defeat?" Ikuyo asked as she stood and flipped a coin to Ukyou.</p><p>"No, Shampoo need to fight for honor." She said as she  lunged forward.</p><p>Ikuyo easily dodged and kept walking toward the exit.</p><p>"You come back!" Shampoo called.</p><p>"When I come back from China."  Ikuyo said as she waved goodbye. "Zeizen."</p><p>"Humph." Shampoo stormed out of the restaurant.</p><p>"I'm never going to make any money if this keeps up." Ukyou  said with a sigh.</p><p>"Ranma-kun!" she called. "Sweetie. I wanna tell you  something." She said as she grabbed his hand and led him into her shop.</p><p>"What?" he asked as she sat him down in one of the chairs.</p><p>"I'm going to China  to visit my village and I was wondering if you would—"</p><p>"Yes!" he said as he held her hand tightly.</p><p>"You will?" she asked happily.</p><p>"Of course. This is my chance to become all man again." He  said.</p><p>"Is that all?" she asked as she pouted. "Anyway, I'm gonna  let Akane-chan come with us. I think it would do you two a lot of good." She  said.</p><p>"Me and that uncute tomboy? What do we have to do?" he asked  as he crossed his arms and turned away.</p><p>"Ranma, sweetie. You know what. As much as I love you I  don't like seeing Akane crying because you called her all those horrible  names." She said angrily. She coughed lightly and turned away from him.</p><p>"You're still not feelin' okay are you?" he asked softly.</p><p>"I'm fine. I need to sort this crap about Kiyoja and my  father and repair my clarinet. I didn't bring any of the heavy duty supplies. I  hate having her in such back condition. It's like a part of me is missing." She  said quietly.</p><p>"Okay then. I'll go with you. I'll protect you and Akane  until you get better." He said as he stood up and clenched his fist  determinedly.</p><p>She smiled and reached out her hand. Ranma grabbed it and  helped her up.</p><p>"I'll go tell Akane now. You should get ready." Ikuyo said  and smile warmly at him.</p><p>"Okay." He said as he happily hummed and walked out of the  store.</p><p>Ikuyo giggled and walked up the stairs to get ready.</p><p>"Great-grandmother! I home!" Shampoo called.</p><p>"Welcome back Shampoo. What's the matter?" Cologne  asked.</p><p>"Ikuyo come here." She said as she sunk into a chair.</p><p>"Ikuyo? That's great. I want to see her." Cologne  said as she hopped toward the door.</p><p>"She go to China."  Shampoo said happily.</p><p>"So soon?"</p><p>"Well, not just yet, but said she injured." Shampoo twisted  in her chair, "Great-grandmother no fight her?" she asked in disbelief. "Even Shampoo  no beat her."</p><p>"I wish to talk to her Shampoo. You watch the restaurant."  With that said Cologne hopped out  of Kat's Café and down the street.</p><p>There was knocking at Ikuyo's front door.</p><p>She walked over to it and opened the door slowly with her  tapped clarinet held out.</p><p>"Down here Ikuyo." Said an old voice.</p><p>Ikuyo gasped. "Cologne-baba!" she said as she crouched down  to meet the very old woman's' gaze. "You've grown so…short." She said with a  perplexed look on her face.</p><p>She hit her on the head with her staff. "Be kind to your  elders. I wished to see you Ikuyo."</p><p>"Ah. About what?" she asked as she let the old woman in.</p><p>"It's been a long time. Shampoo said you were injured."</p><p>"Yeah. By Kiyoja. You remember her right?" she asked as she  led the old woman to the back of the store. She started up some tea and turned  to the old woman seriously. "Killing Snow."</p><p>"The Amazon's created that technique. She was the one that  stole the scroll." Cologne said as  she closed her eyes in deep thought.</p><p>"Cologne-baba. I'm going back to China  with Ranma and Akane to sort this out. I also need to repair my clarinet." She  said as she showed the old Amazon her taped clarinet. She tapped the end of it  on the table. It made a deep dent. "It's become fragile. If I swing it the  key's'll probably fly off." She said with a sigh.</p><p>"Shampoo still thinks of you as a rival? I don't know why  she hasn't given you the kiss of death yet." Cologne  said.</p><p>"She can't get near me." Ikuyo said cockily.</p><p>"Maybe." Cologne  said as Ikuyo handed her a cup of tea.</p><p>"Akane-chan!" she called as she jumped over the dojo wall  and walked down the walkway. She opened the front door and looked around. "Is  Akane-chan here?" she asked Kasumi.</p><p>"Yeah. She's in her room. Would you like me to call her for  you? She's just getting ready."</p><p>"Sure. Thanks Kasumi." Ikuyo took her shoes off and followed  Kasumi toward Akane's room.</p><p>"Akane!" Ranma called.</p><p>"What?" she asked from the dojo. Ranma opened the door and  walked in slowly with his pack on his back.</p><p>"Where are you going?" she asked as she wiped her face with  a towel.</p><p>"We're going to China  with Ikuyo." He said and smiled at her.</p><p>"Humph. Why do I have to go?" she asked stubbornly.</p><p>"Because Ikuyo requests of it." he said as he turned to go. "You  don't gotta go if you don't wanna."</p><p>She watched as he left. "I want to go." She whispered as she  followed him out.</p><p>"Akane. You in there?" she heard Ikuyo's voice thought he  door. "Look, I know you don't want to spend time with Ranma but, you gotta come  for both your relationships status." She said as she leaned against the door.</p><p>Akane wiped her tears as she heard the girls' soothing tone.  She stood up and slung her backpack over her shoulder. She thrust open the door  and Ikuyo tumbled in.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I was leaning on the door for support." She said as she  wiped her pants off.</p><p>"Let's go now." Akane said rather sadly.</p><p>"You don't want to go?" Ikuyo asked as she walked next to  Akane.</p><p>"Yes. I do want to go." Akane said and ran down the stairs.</p><p>Ikuyo shook her head. She took a deep breath and descended  down the stairs. She coughed and wobbled as she walked to the front door.</p><p>"Are you alright Ikuyo?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"I'll be fine." She said as he slipped into her shoes.</p><p>She walked out with Akane and they met up with Ranma at the  gate.</p><p>"Should we run to the border?" Ikuyo asked.</p><p>"Sure." Ranma said with a smirk. "Akane. Can you keep up?"</p><p>"Of course I can." She said as she turned her head away from  him.</p><p>Please review my faithful reviewer(s)!</p>
