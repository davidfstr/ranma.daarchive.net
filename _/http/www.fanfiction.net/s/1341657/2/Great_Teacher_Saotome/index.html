</div><p>Author's  Notes:</p><p>Email:</p><p>Fixed formatting. There are no new or  original characters in this fic. All characters that have an active function in  progressing the storyline are either Great Teacher Onizuka or Ranma 1/2  characters.</p><p>I  am NOT a disciplined writer. I am an inspirational writer. If I don't have  inspiration, it is very hard for me to write. That being said, I apologize for  the lengthy waits between each chapter.</p><p>Just to clarify the ages, Ranma is 22  while the Tendo daughters are all a year older.</p><p>What  happened previously:</p><p>Ranma  returns to Japan after being in China for 4 years, meets with his parents and  Ryoga, and decided to be a teacher. He also meets with his new fiances, the  Tendo daughters, and they find out that Ranma is going to be a new teacher at  their school. Ranma discovers that teaching isn't all it's cracked up to be as  he meets his students, but has its perks, such as working with cute teachers  like Fuyutsuki.</p><p>GTS</p><p>Great  Teacher Saotome</p><p>Lesson  2: A Sudden Storm of Love</p><p>by  Tristan Wright</p><p>"Ohayo, Kasumi-chan," Ranma  said, seeing Kasumi walk down the stairs.</p><p>"Ohayo, Ranma," Kasumi replied.  She walked over to the kitchen and began breakfast.</p><p>The Tendos, more prepared to see Ranma  this time, went about their typical morning rituals and eventually sat down to  eat breakfast.</p><p>"Mmm, that was good  Kasumi-chan!" Ranma said genuinely. He hadn't home cooked Japanese meals  in quite a while. An idea popped into his head as he wondered if Kasumi would  be willing to prepare him daily bentos. He certainly would prefer her cooking  as opposed to the school's cafeteria. He'd have to ask her later.</p><p>"Why thank you," Kasumi said,  smiling.</p><p>As Ranma stood up, Nabiki said, "Wait  up Ranma."</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"We'll walk with you. Come on  Akane," Nabiki said. She doubted anyone would notice he walked to school  with them and if they did, she could just tell them that he lived by them or  something. It was logical that they travelled together since they went to the  same school anyways. Not only that, but it was a good chance to bond with  Ranma. He certainly was turning out to be an interesting guy. Handsome, strong,  and, well maybe not rich, but definitely had some money stashed away somewhere.  What more could she ask for?</p><p>Akane  'hmphed'. "Why do we have to walk with him?" she said, but still  followed her sister and Ranma out the door.</p><p>"Ittekimasu," the three said in  unison.</p><p>"Itterasshai," Kasumi replied.</p><p>"Have fun at school you three,"  Soun said while still reading his newspaper.</p><p>Once outside, Nabiki whispered to Ranma,  "Don't mind Akane, she just really hates guys."</p><p>Ranma nodded in understanding. "I can  see why."</p><p>After Akane caught up with them, she took  to Nabiki's side, trying to distance herself from Ranma as much as possible.  Ranma casually hopped on to an adjacent fence and started walking on it. The  Tendo sisters gave Ranma an odd glance.</p><p>"Why are you up there for?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "I dunno, habit. Good  balance practice."</p><p>"Can't you walk on the ground like  normal people?" Akane asked, irritated.</p><p>"Yeah, I could," he replied, but  still stayed on fence.</p><p>"Showoff..."</p><p>"Only for you Akane-chan," he  said grinning.</p><p>'I'll show him!' Akane thought. Hoping to  knock him off the fence, she swung her bag at Ranma's feet but he lazily  avoided it with a small hop and somersault. Akane growled as he stuck his  toungue out at her.</p><p>"So what was life like in  China?" Nabiki asked Ranma, hoping to dissolve some of the silent tension  between her sister and Ranma. As much as she was the Ice Queen of Furinkan,  being right in between the two was not a desired situation. It was somewhat  ironic, and just plain bad luck, that Ranma emboddied everything Akane hated in  boys; a bit arrogant, a bit of a pervert, and, worst of all, a better martial  artist than her. "You were training there for a couple years, right?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and pondered on the question.  "China was, well...it's hard to summarize. It was one big adventure."</p><p>"Really? I'd love to hear about it  sometime."</p><p>"Sure, I'll tell ya about it  later."</p><p>Akane grumbled to herself, ignoring Ranma  and Nabiki, as she walked into the gates of Furinkan and prepared herself.</p><p>"Akane, I love- eh?" The soccer  boy paused as Ranma stepped in front of Akane with a firm look on his face.  Glaring at his sensei, "What do you want, Saotome?"</p><p>Ranma, grinning evilly but with his overly  dramatic and serious face, held up his hands and announced, "From now on  there will be no mobs attacking Akane Tendo for a date! This is a deliquent  activity and will end right now! Should you still continue, I will take the  neccessary actions as a teacher and suspend all of you from the school grounds.  Of course, you can ignore me and still choose to attack her, but then I'll have  to deal with you PERSONALLY." He cracked his knuckles to emphasize the  point. He REALLY did hope they chose the latter just so he could teach them a  very long lesson that their body wouldn't forget for at least a week.</p><p>Realizing that they could not taunt Ranma  as they did in the classroom, many of Akane's would-be suitors stepped back  nervously and gulped.</p><p>"Hey! I told you I don't need your  help!," Akane stated.</p><p>Ranma shook his head, firm in his reserve.  "I ain't gonna allow this kind of unorganized, free for all to go on. It  ain't right for guys to be ganging up on a girl. Someone could get hurt."  He realized that he didn't care one bit actually if the male students did get hurt,  but still, that was besides the point. He had his principles. Adding playfully,  "I'm doing this for you, Akane-chan!"</p><p>"I can take care of myself!"</p><p>"Eh? I didn't mean it that way! Well,  I did kinda but I mean...ah geez, I just meant that one of THEM could get hurt  too, besides just yourself. I noticed ya don't exactly hold back when you're  being attacked by 20 guys all at once," Ranma said.</p><p>Akane was about to reply when Kuno's voice  shouted, "What is this? What is going on here?" Kuno stepped out in  front, his bokken pointed at Ranma. "What is the meaning of this,  Saotome!"</p><p>"You heard what I said, Kuno. If you  wanna date Akane, you'll ask her out the old fashioned way," Ranma stated.</p><p>"This...this is preposterous! You  cannot do such a thing!" Kuno cried out.</p><p>Ranma was silent for a second, waiting for  Kuno to finish then raised his eyebrows in curiousity when Kuno stopped there.  Ranma would of thought that Kuno, with his pompous type personality and his  ideals of a social heirarchy, would of proudly stated that his father is Head  Principal and that he could get Ranma fired. Ranma had discovered earlier that  Kuno was the principal's son which was why the young Tatewaki had been given  such unlimited leniancy.</p><p>Seeing that Kuno wasn't going to use that  power, which he thought was odd, Ranma said, "I challenge you, Kuno! After  school, meet me at the lot next to the track and field area. If I win, you  hafta promise to stop this whole thing. If I lose, I'll quit my job as a  teacher here." Murmured gasps were heard from various students. Ranma knew  Kuno's honor wouldn't let him refuse a challenge.</p><p>Kuno didn't hesitate and immediately  accepted the challenge. "Very well then! I accept the terms of your  challenge. Until then."</p><p>"...and therefore, if you divide X  over Y..." Ranma could barely hear his own voice over the unified  conversation of the other students, who were completely ignoring him. The  students had seemed to gotten tired of mocking him, at least for the time  being. Maybe they actually thought that wannabe samurai was going to beat him.  'Hah, don't make me laugh.'</p><p>"Sensei, what happens if you use 1 as  the denominator?" a girl student asked.</p><p>His eyes widened in amazement. Was that  the voice of a cute girl that had just soothed his ears? Searching for the  source of the cute voice and he found himself, surprisingly, ogling a beautiful  young brunette in a short skirt. She smiled at him as she leaned forward,  giving him a very nice view, and asked again, "What happens, sensei?"  she asked in a sultry voice.</p><p>Ranma took a second to slap himself in the  face to make sure he wasn't dreaming. Slap, slap. Nope. Wasn't a dream. There  was no way he could of missed this girl yesterday so she must of been absent.  Grinning lecherously, Ranma replied, "That would depend on the second set  of numbers, Miss...?"</p><p>"Nanako Mitsuki," she told him,  giving him a cute smile. He wondered if she was doing that on purpose or she  was just a natural beauty like that. After Ranma explained her the answer,  Nanako nodded in understanding and said, "Thanks, sensei! I'm glad you're  my teacher."</p><p>Ranma nearly melted to the floor at her  words. 'I love being a teacher!' he thought with a joyful smile on his face.</p><p>Class had been pretty uneventful after  Ranma's wonderous meeting with Nanako, though he spent most of his time peeking  quick glances at her when he thought she wasn't looking. Sighing happily, he  fantasized about her as he walked to the cafeteria to get some food. Blinking,  Ranma paused in his steps for a second. Was it just him, or was nearly half the  student female body looking at him? He looked around himself and did indeed  discover that quite a handful of were actually ogling him as he walked through  the halls. They giggled to themselves as he passed them, constantly looking at  him and back to something they had in their hands, which appeared to be some  type of cards or pictures perhaps. Shrugging, Ranma delved into the crowded  lunch line. Being as modest as he was, the young martial artist knew that he  was a pretty good catch. His experiences in China taught him that much.</p><p>With almost liquid like motions, Ranma  skillfully swerved right to the front, got his food, and walked back out within  seconds. Being a martial artist certainly had its advantages. Walking outside  for some fresh air, he spotted Nabiki out the corner of his eye and decided to  go greet her. There's nothing wrong with a teacher having a simple talk with  his student. Nabiki, seeing Ranma coming over, motioned for her associates to  leave her for the moment.</p><p>Smiling her usual sardonic smile, Nabiki  asked, "Hello Ranma-sensei." She put extra emphasis in sensei  playfully. "To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?"</p><p>"Oh I just wanted to say hi. I don't  really know anyone around here," Ranma said. 'Although, I wish I knew  where Fuyutsuki-chan was right now. Maybe if I hang out in the teacher's lounge  more I'll see her.' Just thinking about his young teacher colleague gave him  butterflies in his stomach.</p><p>"I see. By the way, you wouldn't mind  answering some questions for me would you?" Nabiki asked, trying to sound  casual about it. She took out a pad and pencil.</p><p>"Sure, ask away."</p><p>"Okay. What's your favorite  food?"</p><p>"Ah, um..." He really did love  ice cream, but that wasn't really a manly thing to say. "I like all kinds  of food, hard to pick just one."</p><p>"What's your favorite color?"</p><p>"Red."</p><p>"Do you have any hobbies?"</p><p>"Martial arts and pa-" Ranma  barely caught himself. "...and um, motorcycles."</p><p>"What are your meassurements?"</p><p>He wondered why Nabiki would want to know  that, but answered her nonetheless.</p><p>"How much can you bench?"</p><p>"Uh, I dunno. Never tried. I lifted a  car once before though," Ranma answered truthfully.</p><p>"What type of girl do you like? You  know, like do you like smart girls? Athletic girls? Girls with blue eyes? Girls  in short skirts? Girls with big bust?"</p><p>"Hmm, ah I like all kinds of  girls..." Ranma began to babble as he slipped into his lecherous reverie  with a silly grin. "Athletic girls are definitely a plus, but smart girls  can be cute too. I like girls with red hair and I love short skirts cuz-"  It finally sunk as to what kind of question he had been asked causing a light  blush of embarrassment to form. "H-HEY! What kind of question is that?  Especially for a student to be asking a teacher!"</p><p>Nabiki smirked. Her scheme, while simple  and straight forward, had a strong psychological base. When asking him normal  questions, she got him relaxed and he began to answer questions without really  thinking too much on it. That was when she caught him off guard. He was simple  like most men, it was almost dissapointing. She discarded the thought.  "Oh, nothing, nevermind," Nabiki said, trying to sound innocent.  "Besides," she whispered, "I am your fiance."</p><p>Ranma looked around nervously. "Shh,  you said you wouldn't tell anyone!"</p><p>"For a price..."</p><p>He looked at her incredulously. "But  I just paid you rent!"</p><p>"You paid for only yourself. I still  have to take care of the house and my family you know."</p><p>"You don't REALLY want me to get in  trouble do ya?"</p><p>Nabiki played with his emotions for a bit,  pretending to ponder the question, before answering, "No, I don't. I guess  I'll let you have that one as a freebie." She had never seriously  considered blowing Ranma's cover. There was still too much money that had yet  to be milked. "You owe me one then."</p><p>Ranma grumbled. 'Is this how she gets most  of income?" he wondered.</p><p>"One more thing."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"You better not lose today's fight  with Kuno," Nabiki stated. While many of the students had seen Ranma's  fight with Kuno, she guessed that probably more than half of them had written  off the victory as nothing more than a fluke. In other words, Ranma winning  equaled money.</p><p>"Heh, don't worry, I can handle Kuno  any day," Ranma said with a carefree wave of his hand.</p><p>"Dadadadada!" Kuno's battle cry  rang.</p><p>Ranma easily dodged each strike.  "Give it up, Kuno."</p><p>"Never! This battle is not yet  lost!" Kuno lunged forward and struck at Ranma, only to find he was no  longer there. A couple pictures slipped out of Kuno's shirt as he had slashed.  They landed at Ranma's feet. Curiously, Ranma picked up the photos and looked  them. A silly grin came onto his face as he examined Akane's beautiful form (well,  her body anyways, not her technique) as she worked out in the dojo. Meanwhile,  Ranma dodged Kuno's strike unconciously.</p><p>"Your going to get hurt if you don't  take him seriously, Ranma!" Akane shouted at him as he lept next to her.  Peeking over his shoulder, she asked, "What are you looking at anyways...?  HEY! Those are pictures of me you pervert!"</p><p>Ranma stumbled in surprise as he barely  managed to dodge her fist. "Er, wait, it ain't what it looks like! These  ain't-" his mouth stop working when Akane's second strike slammed into  his jaw, sending him flying into the crowd behind. A few girls 'eeked' as they  saw Ranma's body bounding towards them and scattered quickly in order to avoid  it.</p><p>"Ouch..." Ranma rubbed his chin.  "Ya didn't hafta hit me so hard, Akane-chan! Students should be nice to  their teachers!" Akane 'hmphed' at that. "'sides, the pictures were  Kunos! He dropped them."</p><p>Realizing her fault, Akane turned a glare  to her sister. "Nabikiiii!" She should of known. After all, it hadn't  been the first time Akane had found one of her obssessed admirers with pictures  of her.</p><p>Nabiki gave Akane an innocent look.  "What?"</p><p>"Geez...eh?" In the crowds  haste, a few of the girls had left a set of photos on the ground. "Wh-what  the heck? Wha- ack!" Ranma cried out as Kuno's bokken grazed the air an  inch in front of Ranma's chest, the air pressure making a cut into his shirt.  Ranma rolled backwards on the ground in a crouch, back to Akane.</p><p>"See! I told you you should of been  more serious!" Akane stated with a frown, looking down at the martial  artist slash school teacher below her. Inwardly though, she was a bit happy at  the fact that she was right.</p><p>"I was distracted! The-...ya know,  pokey dots don't really suit you Akane-chan," he blurted out. "Personally,  I prefer red with- er..." Ranma stopped and cringed when Akane's aura  flared. He had yet again put his foot in his mouth.</p><p>"You...you perverted JERK!"  Akane flustered in embarrassment and angrily kicked him away like a soccer  ball.</p><p>"Gah!"</p><p>Akane picked up the second set of photos  Ranma dropped. Her mouth gaped in surprise when she found that the pictures  were not of her, but of Ranma. There were a few photos of him training in the  morning that his well toned body and another of him sleeping, which, Akane had  to admit, made Ranma look incredibly adorable. She would never admit that  outloud of course. Trying to overwrite the warm feeling with anger, Akane  glared at Nabiki again. "N-Nabiki! How could you!"</p><p>Nabiki shrugged. "By popular  demand."</p><p>"What sorcery are you using,  fiend!" Kuno said as yet another attack missed Ranma.</p><p>"Sorcery? I ain't using nothing.  C'mon Kuno, try harder. This is getting boring," Ranma said. Dashing in  under the bokken, he pivoted his left foot and thrusted upwards, uppercutting  Kuno and sending him sprawling into the ground. He was out cold.</p><p>"How anti-climatic," Nabiki  commented. It had been quite obvious to even the most inadept person to martial  arts that Ranma had been playing the younger boy the entire time.</p><p>Ranma stood over Kuno's prone body,  scratching the back of his head with wonder as he had expected the young  samurai prodigy to get back up, but he hadn't. Guess Ranma had put a bit too  much power into that last one. Still, he supposed he should of expected that  seeing how Kuno was five years too early to have any chance at him. Even then,  his younger self probably could of taken him without any trouble.</p><p>"...that's it?"</p><p>"Well that was boring!"</p><p>"Hey! I want my money back! I wanted  a martial arts duel, not a boxing match!"</p><p>Nabiki shook her head at the students,  saying "Too bad, the tickets are non refundable." With the betting  pool, she had also charged admission. She smiled greedily to herself. Today had  certainly been profitable for her enterprise.</p><p>"Huh? What tickets?" Ranma  asked.</p><p>"Oh, nothing much..." Nabiki  replied off-handedly. "Just minor admission fee to watch your fight."</p><p>"You CHARGED them just for  that?"</p><p>"Obviously you don't know my  sister," Akane said dryly. "She'll do almost anything for a buck.  Even sell pictures of you."</p><p>Nabiki faked a hurt expression. "How  can you say that about your own sister?"</p><p>Ranma blinked as his thoughts slowly  dawned on him. "Sell pictures of...H-HEY! So THAT'S what they were doing  with them!"</p><p>Nabiki decided to make her exit there.  Smiling slyly as she fled, Nabiki shouted to Ranma from a distance, "Don't  take it personally Ranma-chan!"</p><p>"Ranma-chan?"</p><p>"...and then I found out the girl had  been selling pictures of me!" Ranma complained to his friend, who was  tweaking a motorcycle. "Oh well, I knew I was good looking, but now I got  fans! And at least the all girls are cute. They almost make me lose  control!"</p><p>Ryoga chuckled and shook his head. "I  hate to spoil your good mood Ranma, but seriously speaking...Onibaka's Ranma  Saotome, the strongest in the Shounan district. Do you really want to be a  teacher? I don't think that's too possible. The kids these days are really  messed up, especially from what you've already told me. They're difficult to  teach, and if you mess up in any way as a teacher, you'll get fired."</p><p>Ranma just grinned. "Ha, I'll be the  best teacher in all of Japan! Just you wait and see. I'll use my own technique  to prove it to you."</p><p>"Right..." Ryoga said, rolling  his eyes. "I don't see why you want to be a teacher, a SCHOOL teacher, in  the first place. A martial arts teacher I could see, but a school teacher?  Considering our experiences with teachers or with school in general..."</p><p>"Heh, I have my reasons," Ranma said.  His smile almost seemed a bit nonstalgic.</p><p>Ranma cheerfully whistled to himself as he  walked back to the Tendo Dojo. "A teacher, huh? Better get home and  prepare tomorrow's coursework," he said to himself. 'Eh? Is that Nanako-chan?'  he thought, spotting her sitting on the railing. Were those tears in her eyes?  Ranma walked over to her. "Is that you, Nanako-chan?"</p><p>She looked up at him with sad, glistening  eyes. "Sensei..."</p><p>"Wh-what is it? What's wrong?"</p><p>"I, um..." Nanako was silent for  a moment, before shaking her head to herself, as if firming her resolve in a  decision she knew she couldn't back out of. "Can you come to my house and  tutor me?"</p><p>If guys were allowed to cry, Ranma would  be crying right then. "I'd love to!"</p><p>"Wow, nice house ya got here,"  Ranma told Nanako. It was a rather high-end house, quite big, with two stories.  "Reminds me one of those houses you see on TV. Your family must be pretty  wealthy. No one home?" Ranma asked, looking around the house. He spotted a  large plate of expensive sushi on the table next to the them. Drooling, he  gasped, "Oooh! Salmon! Shrimp! And eel!"</p><p>Nanako didn't say anything. She walked  over to the plate, glanced at the note on top of it, then crumpled it up. She  picked up the plate.</p><p>Restraining his hands from the plate,  Ranma asked, "Hey, you're not gonna eat all of that by yourself are  ya?"</p><p>His student still didn't say anything as  she walked to the trash can.</p><p>"Pleeeaaassssee, let me have some  your sushi Nanako-chan! I love sa- AH? What are you doing?" Ranma cried  out in agony as Nanako dropped the entire plate into the garbage.</p><p>"Noooo!" He stood over the  trash, staring down into mess with a depressed expression. He really had been  really hungry, it was almost dinner time. "Watcha do that for! That was a  waste of expensive food ya know."</p><p>Nanako stared blankly at the trash with a  hidden sadness behind her eyes. "We didn't always used to live in this big  house," she said quietly. Ranma, noticing the seriousness in her face,  instantly calmed and listened to her curiously. "My poppa is the owner of  a Japanese restaurant franchise. My momma owns four supermarkets. They worked  hard to get get this home, but now..."</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Nanako said nothing. After a moment, her  cheery smile returned and she said, "Sensei, let's go to my room so you  can start tutoring me." She motioned to follow her upstairs. Ranma gulped.  Truth be told, he had never been in a girl's room before. Actually, that wasn't  true, but no girl had ever intentionally invited him. Actually, that wasn't  true, but no typically normal school girl had ever invited him. When they  entered, he was greeted with a sweet aroma that tickled his nose. 'It smells so  nice in here,' Ranma thought. The room was a bit what he expected; it was a  room filled with bright colors, a few stuffed animals on her bed and a couple  pictures on her desk. A normal, schoolgirl's room. Kind of reminded him of  Nabiki's room but with a bit more fluff. He heard some shuffling from behind  him.</p><p>"So what do ya wanna wo-  N-Nanako-chan?" The young teacher's eyes bulged when he saw that his  student was taking off her clothing and was now half naked in a bra and  panties. A red flush heated his cheeks. "Wh-what are you doing?"</p><p>Nanako smiled at him playfully. "I  want you to tutor me in biology, Senseeiii," she said in a seductive  voice.</p><p>Ranma backed up to the wall in fear and  shock. "A-ah, um, I'm not very good with b-biology," he managed to  stutter out. Looking for any distration he could find, he picked up a near by  picture and put it in front of his chest defensively. "Wh-what a nice  picture this is!"</p><p>Nanako's mood darkened suddenly as she saw  it.</p><p>Wondering what the cause was, Ranma took a  look at the picture. It was a younger Nanako with two older people, most likely  her parents, next to her. All of them were smiling cheerfully. He wondered what  Nanako had been talking about before. The martial artist became a bit envious  as he stared at the picture more, seeing how happy they were. Ranma had never  had a real family growing up as a child. Why would she be sad at such a  peaceful photograph? Maybe one of her parents were dead? But he remembered  Nanako mentioning her mom and dad so he doubted that.</p><p>"...I...We used to always eat  together before my momma and poppa got better jobs," Nanako started slowly  in a sad tone. "Now I hardly get to see them and, whenever I do see them,  together, they're always argueing." Tears welled up in her eyes. "I  ran away once because...because I couldn't stand living in this cold, lonely  house that's changed my parents!" She burst into tears and clutched his  chest. Hesistantly, Ranma wrapped his arms around the crying girl in hopes of  comforting her.</p><p>"Bingo!"</p><p>Ranma saw a few flashes come from behind  the curtains, outside, on the balcony to his left. The shades opened up  revealing three of his students, one holding a camera and all with cocky smirks  on their faces.</p><p>"Look what we have here! You  shouldn't be doing such shameful things like this, Saotome-sensei," the  guy with the camera said. He dangled a polaroid in front of Ranma and laughed.  "We can make a lot of money if we sell these to magazines. We could get a  million yen of them!" The three of them laughed. "What should we do,  sensei?"</p><p>Ranma whipped his head to Nanako, who was  putting on her clothes back on. "N-Nanako, you couldn't have...did  you...?" he asked, fearing the truth.</p><p>"Sorry, sensei, but they said they  would split the money with me if they got it," Nanako admitted with an  apologetic smile.</p><p>"You know, once these pictures get  out, even if you die you'll still never be a teacher again!" one of the  boys said. "Give us a million by the end of the week. If you don't, these  pictures will be posted everywhere, haha."</p><p>"..." What could Ranma  possibly do? Beat them up and take the pictures? That would end in the same  result as if the photos were distributed out. A teacher viciously mugging three  of his students. It would of been his word against theirs.</p><p>"Haha, look at this, big tough  martial artist scared speechless!"</p><p>Ranma had his head down, his bangs  covering his eyes in a dark shadow. "Nanako...did you plan this from the  start?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Was it all just an act?" he  asked in a dark tone.</p><p>Unfazed, Nanako said pleasantly, "Why  would I hook up with an old man like you?" It almost seemed as if she had  avoided the question though. Almost.</p><p>Her accomplices laughed again at Ranma.  "What an idiot!"</p><p>Ranma stood up and left out the room.  "Don't forgot, one million within the week!" he heard from behind  him. A couple blocks down the road, after leaving Nanako's house, the martial  artist calmly thrust his fist through a wall. Ranma Saotome was mad.</p><p>The three students sat on a bench and  discussed their victorious blackmail operation.</p><p>"It's halirious, the way he  looked!"</p><p>"What a big fish we caught,  haha!"</p><p>"I can't believe that Nanako is such  a good actor. I thought she was really crying!"</p><p>"When I heard her sad story, even I  wanted to cry!"</p><p>"No kidding! And now...we're a  million yen richer!"</p><p>All of them laughed with glee. A lone  motorcyclist travelled the street, cutting through their laughter. Annoyed, one  of them said, "Shut up already! Get lost!"</p><p>Two more men on motorcycles joined the  other.</p><p>Standing up, seeing the challenge, the  student said, "What do you guys want? You looking for trouble?"</p><p>The other two grabbed nearby pipes.  "You wanna fight? Bring it on!"</p><p>Three more joined the other motorcyclist.  Then four more. And five more. And six more. Finally, the park was sprawling  with gangsters on motorcycles. The students were completely surrounded.</p><p>All of the students mouth dropped and  cowered back in dread.</p><p>One of the gangsters hopped off the back  of vehicle and made his way toward the students with an angry expression.  "Who are you? Didn't you know that this is our territory? Your pretty  brave! coming here and raising a ruckus."</p><p>"W-we didn't know any better! Please  forgive us!" the students pleaded. The interrogation was cut short as  someone shoved their way through the crowd. Ranma stepped through casually, a  cigarette in his mouth.</p><p>"S-Saotome!" one of the students  said, surprised.</p><p>There was a murmured hush among the crowd  as they recognized Ranma.</p><p>"No way..."</p><p>"Is that really him?"</p><p>"Is has to be! That's Ranma Saotome,  one of the legendary Onibaka!"</p><p>The crowd of gangsters gasped. The three  students look around in wonder. "They know him?"</p><p>"Did you do anything to them?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"N-no, we didn't do anything!"</p><p>"Really? That's good," Ranma  said, relieved.</p><p>Seeing their savior, the students  scampered to Ranma. "S-sensei!"</p><p>"These guys are my..." Ranma's  tone got darker with each word. He took off his shirt and cracked his knuckles.  "...prey."</p><p>"Lift them up. So, does the  park's water taste good?" Ranma said in a low growl. "Hmm?"</p><p>"Saotome-sensei, please don't kill  us!" one of the students pleaded.</p><p>"Ya don't hafta worry about that, I  ain't gonna kill you...I still want to torture you some more."</p><p>A student dared to contradict him.  "You're an educator! Don't you know as a teacher you can't treat your  students like this?"</p><p>Ranma didn't look amused. "Don't be  naive! An educator is an educator, but you guys have been messing with me from  the start. An educator is a human being too. Even we have our limits and there  are times when we are pushed over the edge. This is one of those times. When  that happens, I ain't no teacher no more!" Ranma kicked the rope that held  them up and sent them into the pond once more.</p><p>He let them savor the ice cold water for a  bit before giving the other gangsters the signal for them to be pulled up.  "That's enough."</p><p>"We're sorry! We'll never do it  again!"</p><p>Ranma ignored their pleas and looked off  with a distant look. "Why don't we try to tear down this wall? This wall  that always exists between teachers and students." He blew a puff smoke  into the air, looking up at the sky, thinking to himself. "It ain't that  hard to improve human relationships, right? BUt if you guys insist on being  childish, then I don't got nothing more to say. You gotta take responsibility  for your own actions. Nobody...Nobody's going to feel sorry for you."</p><p>No one said a word as they listened to  Ranma's lecture quietly.</p><p>Ranma gave a forgiving smile at the  bruised students. "So think clearly next time."</p><p>"Sensei..." they cried in  happiness. Happiness at realizing their mistakes and happiness that the torture  was finally ending.</p><p>"Anyways...let's continue our game  now shall we!" Ranma cackled evilly.</p><p>"EHH?" the students shrieked.  "AHHHHHH!"</p><p>Ryoga dragged the mildly drunken Ranma  along to the Tendo Dojo as Ranma told his problems to his friend. When his  friend had suddenly called him up and asked him to meet him at a bar, Ryoga  could easily tell something was wrong. After all, they had just finished  talking hours before. Ranma had gotten himself into a drunken stupor and began  confessing the events that had happened earlier. Ranma had actually only had a  couple drinks but, even as a top martial artist, he couldn't hold his liquor  well at all.</p><p>"I've really done it now..."  Ranma said with a sigh.</p><p>Ryoga shook his head at Ranma. "I  told you being a teacher just isn't cut out for you. Do you really want to be  one that badly? Take my advise and give it up, Ranma," Ryoga said,  consoling Ranma. "As a teacher, your wages are low and it's a real hasle.  It's not that great. You'll have to deal with problematic students like that  all the time. Can you really do that?"</p><p>"I admire you, Ryoga..." Ranma  said with a sad smile and mellow tone. "You went to Tokyo for five years  and you were able to get all the special qualifications in such a short amount  of time. Then you opened up your own store so quickly and turned your dream into  a reality. What have I accomplished? Compared to you...I'm..."</p><p>Ryoga frowned and gave Ranma a hard pat on  the back. "Come on Ranma, this isn't like you. When did you start losing  your fighting spirit? What happened to the 'Wild Steed' Ranma Saotome? 'Saying  pathetic things ain't my style.' Isn't that what you said when we came to  Tokyo?"</p><p>"I know...I know...turn left here and  we should be there," Ranma directed Ryoga. Even if he was drunk, there was  no way Ranma was going to let Ryoga take him on one of his lost journeys again.</p><p>"I'll see ya around, Ranma,"  Ryoga said as he left his friend at the door step to the Tendo residence.</p><p>"Yeah...see ya..." Ranma sighed  again. 'Okay, time to wake up,' he thought. Ranma slapped himself in the face a  couple times and used his ki to burn off some of the alcohol. It wouldn't look  good for his image if he came into the house looking and acting like a drunk.  He still had a couple of fiances to impress.</p><p>"Tadaima," Ranma said as he took  off his shoes and walked to the living room. When he arrived there he found  three very angry fiances. Well, perhaps not all of them were angry. Akane  definitely was by the look on her face. Nabiki looked indifferent, though  mildly annoyed. Kasumi had her motherly admonishing expression on. He saw both  of his parents at the table along with Soun. His mother was looking calm as  usual, but Genma on the other hand looked like he had been strangled by Soun  before Ranma made his appearance. "Um...what'd I do?"</p><p>"What did you do!" Akane shouted  angrily. "We just found out you're a two-timing pervert, you jerk!"  Her belief on boys had once again been reinstated.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Nabiki shook her head at Ranma.  "Ranma, Ranma, Ranma...I knew you were a playboy, but this takes the  cake."</p><p>"It's not right to so many fiances,  Ranma-kun," Kasumi stated in her admonishing voice.</p><p>Ranma sweated, seeing what they were  talking about. "Er, oh, that...well, it ain't my fault!" He pointed  at Genma who had an expression that said 'don't hurt me please!'. "He's the  one that engaged me!"</p><p>Soun resumed his previous activity and  wringed Genma's neck. "Saotome, how could you!"</p><p>"GAAH!"</p><p>Nodoka sighed. This had been what she  wanted to avoid. She decided to put it off at least a day before telling the  Tendos, so as not to invoke any bad impressions the Tendo daughters had about  her son. The sooner she told them though, the better. They would have found out  eventually. Nodoka continued what she had been saying before Ranma came.  "Ukyo will be arriving here tommorow. She has made arrangements to live at  one of her restaurant stationed here. Until a way can be figured out how to  appease everyone's honor, Ukyo will now, officially with my blessing, also be  Ranma's fiance."</p><p>"Ucchan's coming here tommorow?"  Ranma said in surprise. He hadn't seen her in three years. Guiltily, Ranma knew  he should of told her that he had come back from China already, but the words  Ukyo had spoken to him on the day of his departure to China made him decide  otherwise. Although he gulped, he still got butterflies in his stomach when  thinking about her. Ranma knew that Ukyo would probably escalate his female  troubles but...it would be nice seeing her again. He had missed her.</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow.  "Ucchan?"</p><p>Ranma nodded with a bit of embarrassment.  "Er, yeah, it's my nickname for her."</p><p>"You knew her?" Nabiki asked.  That had been new to the story Genma had told them. "How come you didn't  stop the engagement then?"</p><p>"'cause I didn't know about it!"  Ranma retorted. "I wasn't even with the old man when he engaged me to her  when I was like seven or something. Gramps was training me then. I met her  later in high school and we became friends. I didn't wanna break the engagement  then because it would hurt her honor."</p><p>'Gramps?' Soun thought. He didn't know  Saotome had a grandfather and he doubted that Genma would allow his son to be  trained by one of Nodoka's family. The whole reason Genma had run off was to  escape Nodoka's influence as his friend had told him in numerous postcards.  Soun would have to ask him about it later.</p><p>Akane threw her hands up in exapseration.  "This is just great! I'm going to bed!"</p><p>"I suppose it is getting rather  late," Nodoka said. She stood up and motioned to her husband like a pet.  "Come husband. We will retire for the night."</p><p>"Yes, dear..."</p><p>"That reminds me," Nabiki began  suspiciously, "Where have you been this whole time?"</p><p>Ranma coughed nervously. "I was, ah,  tutoring a student then I went out with a friend, heheh..."</p><p>"Right..." Nabiki said with  narrowed eyes. That would explain the scent of alcohol she could smell off him,  but something didn't add up. Tutoring and going out with a friend didn't take  that long. Shrugging, Nabiki retired upstairs. She'd find out what it was  sooner or later.</p><p>"I suppose I should be getting some  rest as well," Soun stated after returning to his normal state.  "Goodnight."</p><p>Kasumi nodded. "Goodnight father. Oh,  Ranma-kun, I saved you some dinner if you still want it."</p><p>"Sure!" he said. Taking the  plate of food, he sat down and began eating. Remembering something, Ranma  asked, "Oh yeah, do ya think you could make a bento for tommorow? If...if  it's not too much trouble that is..." He hated relying on others, but  Kasumi's gourmey cooking was too much to pass up.</p><p>Kasumi smiled. "Sure, it's no trouble  at all."</p><p>"Thanks!"</p><p>Ranma continued to eat as Kasumi went of  too her room and came back with a book in her hands. She brought a chair close  enough to the outside that she could feel the cool breeze upon her skin. She  sat down and began to read. Ranma looked up for a moment and decided to strike  up a conversation. "Watcha doing?"</p><p>"Reading. I enjoy reading at  night."</p><p>Duh. Why did he ask a stupid question like  that? For all his years on the road, Ranma wasn't too good with social interactions  on the casual level. Flirting, which he'd like to pride himself at being good  at, was a completely different thing from casual conversation. "Watcha  reading?"</p><p>"A medical book on brain surgery that  Tofu-sensei lent me," Kasumi replied.</p><p>"Eh? Brain surgery? Why ya reading  about that for?"</p><p>"I find it interesting," Kasumi  said, not at all bothered by Ranma's constant questioning. "I used to want  to a doctor when I was young."</p><p>Ranma scratched his forehead in wonder and  asked, "Well...why ain't ya? Why aren't you a doctor I mean? Or trying to  be one."</p><p>Kasumi looked hesitant for a moment,  before saying, "When...when mother died, I made a decision that I would  take care of the family from now on. I would try as best as I could to do all  the things that mother couldn't do now that she was gone. I've been taking care  of my sisters ever since I graduated from high school." She tried to smile  and cover up her sadness. "Besides, I'm too old now to be chasing after  dreams," she said, a bit jokingly.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"What?" Kasumi asked, a bit  surprised at the firmness in which he stated that.</p><p>Ranma walked over to Kasumi and placed his  hand on her shoulder. "No, you're not too old to be chasing dreams. Never  believe that. I'm 22 and look at me. I'm still chasing after dreams. I ain't a  great teacher yet. You're a young, beautiful woman, Kasumi. You still have your  whole life ahead of you. It's not too late. It's never too late." Despise  his earlier complaints, Ranma would never give up. He had faced too many hurdles,  been through too much, to give up his new dream now. He had turned his life  around completely, from a life of crime to being a school teacher, against all  odds. Everyone said that he couldn't do it, but he proved them wrong.</p><p>A rosey blush touched Kasumi's cheeks,  both at his hand on her shoulder and at his words. "B-But..."</p><p>Ranma gently squeezed her shoulder, trying  to dispel her pessimisms. "Your sisters can take care of themselves now.  Akane's an up and coming martial artist and Nabiki has a great business mind on  her shoulders." Ranma said the last bit with a bit of wryness, but  continued. "You're only 20 years old. You have plenty of time to start  your path on becoming a doctor. It's too late to try enrolling this semester,  but next semester I want you to apply to some universities."</p><p>"But I don't have the money..."  Kasumi began to protest.</p><p>Ranma grinned like it wasn't a problem.  "I'll pay for ya."</p><p>Kasumi's eyes widened. "How...?"  She shook her head. "I couldn't take such money from you."</p><p>He knew from her tone that Kasumi  would feel indebted to him and couldn't accept that. It was a feeling Ranma  knew well. "Okay, tell ya what. If you study as hard as you can to pass  the college entrance exams, then I'll help ya out financially. And I'm sure  Nabiki has some stuffed away somewhere that could aid you." Ranma was  pretty positive that not all of Nabiki's business activities went to funding  the house, if today was any indication. He was sure that she had some excess  money.</p><p>"Your family will definitely support  you," Ranma said. "You've given them so much, I think it's time that  they gave something back." He had been a bit suspicious as to why Kasumi  stayed home all the time and did all the house work. He highly doubted that Kasumi  enjoyed always having to play mother for her family while never having a life  of her own.</p><p>Seeing her begin to protest again, Ranma  put a soft finger on Kasumi's lips and smiled at her. Surprised, she instantly  relented at the smile that seemed to drown away all of her worries. Letting go  of her final resistance, Kasumi simply nodded at Ranma's statement and request.  For once...just this once...she'd let someone else take care of her. Take care  of her problems she quickly corrected herself, blushing.</p><p>Ranma released his hold on her lips and  stood up, grinning. "Great! It's a deal then." He proceeded to clean  up his finished dinner and head to his room.</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Thank you..."</p><p>"Heh, no problem. Night,  Kasumi-chan."</p><p>"Goodnight, Ranma-kun."</p><p>V1.22</p><p>JAPANESE  DEFINITIONS:</p><p>"-san":  Mr., Ms., Mrs., Miss.; The suffix denoting that the person being spoken to is  of equal or nearly equal social status.
