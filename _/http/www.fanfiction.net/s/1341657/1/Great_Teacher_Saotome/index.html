</div><p>Disclaimer: Ya know, if you think about it logically, no one is EVER going  to sue you for a story you're writing on your own time for free. I mean,  seriously, that's like someone suing you for fanart. They say that the greatest  compliment is imitation. You're promoting the anime. The way I see it,  disclaimers in fanfics are nothing more of a sign of respect (or to slap in a  funny joke) to the creators than anything else.</p><p>Author's Notes: All, or most (Cologne is still 300+ ;p), of the Ranma  characters' ages have been altered for story reasons. Nabiki and Akane are  still in high school though since it does run until the age of 18. Ranma is 22.</p><p>Also, I use some Japanese phrases because it just wouldn't sound right or  have the same meaning if I used their English counterparts so if you don't  understand what one of them means, definitions are at the bottom of the fic.</p><p>Great Teacher Saotome</p><p>Prologue</p><p>Panties. Panties were truly beautiful. White,  red, silk, cotton...they were all so wonderful. A man with his black hair tied  in a pigtail, wearing a white suit, black tie, and one earring in his ear was  crouched beside an escalator, staring up through the transparent glass. His  nostrils flared as he looked up the two girls' skirts with a silly grin on his  face.</p><p>"White. Not too bad..." he said,  lost in his own world. He shook his head, taking himself out of his blissful  reverie, and took his cigarette out of his mouth. "That's right, have to  focus. Can't get nervous now, it's only the interview today."</p><p>Two young men walked up to him with grins on  their faces. "Hey man."</p><p>The man in the suit looked up uninterestedly.</p><p>"Yeah you, pigtail."</p><p>"Were you just peeking at girls'  underwear? Ehh? How can such an upstanding young man commit such a crime?"  the man said mockingly. He crouched down to look at him face to face. The  pigtailed man said nothing in reply, still staring at the two uncaringly.</p><p>Smirking arrogantly, the punk grabbed his  shirt and lifted him off the ground. "Ehh, what a brave peeping tom you  are!"</p><p>"If you don't want to get hurt, you'll  give us your money," his accomplish stated. "Otherwise, we'll beat  you up and hand you over to the cops."</p><p>Still looking at his would-be muggers, he  punched the side of the wall, his fist piercing through it. Pulling out a  handful of wires, he grinned. "Well, we have a problem here. Who's going  to get beat up? Is it, me, the pervert who's the undisputed heir to the Saotome  Anything Goes Martial Arts? Or two, the idiot punks who are harassing  me?" Both of them stared at the fist with bulging eyes,  speechless.</p><p>"So, who's it gonna be?" He pulled  out the cords further to emphasize his point.</p><p>"Um, well I-"</p><p>"We didn't-"</p><p>They were cut short as punches caught them in  the face, sending them sprawling to the floor. They couldn't do much more than  cry out for help as the beating began.</p><p>A screeching motorcycle came to a stop at the  top of the stairs behind him. "Ranma, where are you?" called the  rider on the bike, taking off his helmet. The man wore a yellow headband with  black spots, a blue collar shirt and gray pants.</p><p>"Oh, Ryoga, thanks for coming!"  Releasing the two punks' collars, Ranma glanced at his watch. "Ah great,  it's this late already!" Running past the two punks, he said, "Sorry,  but we'll hafta continue this lesson a bit later. Be more careful the next time  you try to mug someone!"</p><p>Hopping in front of Ryoga, into the driver's  seat, Ranma took the helmet out of Ryoga's hand and put it on. "Let's go,  Ryoga!" he said, starting up the bike.</p><p>"Hey!" his friend said, mildly  surprised at Ranma taking the helm. Ranma stepped on the gas and took off. The  wind ruffled Ryoga's hair as they cruised through the streets.</p><p>"Only today right?" Ryoga asked.  "Why did you choose me to take you after so many years anyways?"</p><p>"Ah who cares, we're old buddies  right?" Ranma replied, waving it off with a smile. "Come to think of  it, it's been six years since we first came to Tokyo."</p><p>"Yeah..."</p><p>"I can't believe that I came back to  find that you've opened up your own shop! You've changed."</p><p>"Stop saying that, you're the one I  can't believe."</p><p>"Whaddya mean?"</p><p>"Idiot," Ryoga said smirking,  "I'm talking about you becoming a student teacher after coming back from  training in China for four years! You really want to be a teacher, huh?"</p><p>Ranma simply grinned. "Today's the day!  I get excited just thinking about it." He picked up the front wheel in  glee, exclaiming, "By becoming a student teacher, I'll be able to meet  lots of cute female students!" He could imagine it now...the sultry voice  of a female student...</p><p>"Saotome-sensei, please instruct me  here..."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Here, of course..."</p><p>"Where do you mean?"</p><p>"Right here...here..."</p><p>Ranma blushed at his own dream and laughed  out loud. "Buahaha! I can't wait! I'm getting more and more excited just  thinking about it!"</p><p>Ryoga grimaced. "Still the same  Ranma..."</p><p>Miles down the road later...</p><p>"Oh? That's a really great bike isn't  it," the policeman said, deadpanned.</p><p>"Isn't it? So, can you let us go this  time? C'mooon, I'll even introduce ya to a girl!" Ranma pleaded.</p><p>Ryoga stood behind him with his arms crossed,  rolling his eyes. "Idiot. Same ol' Ranma. Things like this always seem to  follow him around." He smiled wistfully as he thought about the old days.  "Those sure were some crazy times," Ryoga said to himself.</p><p>"Please sign here."</p><p>"Er...but, um..."</p><p>Ryoga, grinning, sighed and shook his head.  He had to admit, it was nice to see his old friend back. Things were going to  get interesting now.</p><p>GTS</p><p>Great Teacher Saotome</p><p>Lesson 1: Here's Ranma-sensei!</p><p>by Tristan Wright</p><p>"You WHAT?" Ranma and Nodoka  yelled out in surprise.</p><p>Genma began to sweat profusely. "Um, I  said I engaged Ranma to the daughters of an old friend of mine, Soun Tendo. I  was only thinking of uniting the schools and Ranma's future!"</p><p>Ranma scoffed at that. "Right...just  like you were thinking of that when you engaged me to Ucchan?"</p><p>"Er..."</p><p>"Ucchan?" Nodoka asked questioned.</p><p>"Yeah, Ukyo Kuonji," Ranma said,  glaring at his father who flinched at the name. "I met her later in high  school. She came to kill me because she said her dad and Pop engaged us. Pop  said he was gonna take her to me but instead he just took her yatai, her dowry,  and left her there!" He resisted the urge to wring Genma's neck.</p><p>"Husband, how could you!" Nodoka  said, shocked.</p><p>"Er, but I was hungry!" Genma whined.</p><p>Ranma nodded in agreement with his mother,  still glaring menacingly at Genma. "And don't forget that Pop wasn't even  taking care of me when he engaged me to Ucchan, the old lech was."</p><p>Nodoka narrowed her eyes at Genma. Ranma had  told her about most of his life, with the exception of his gang affairs of  course. Was this truly the man she had married? It felt like a lifetime ago  when she had taken Genma as her husband. The man needed to be punished.  "Genma..."</p><p>"Y-Yes dear?"</p><p>"Don't call me that. You will need to  earn that right again." Genma cringed. "I will meet with the Tendos  today, with Ranma." Nodoka held up her hand before Ranma could protest,  "HOWEVER, the marriage will be on my terms. If I see the circumstances  unsuitable for Ranma, I will revoke the pact."</p><p>"B-but-" Genma tried.</p><p>"I CAN revoke the pact as I am the head  of the clan," Nodoka said. "In order to maintain honor, I will make  an effort to see it through. Nothing more than that."</p><p>Although it wasn't exactly what Genma wanted,  he wasn't in the position to argue so he meekly nodded.</p><p>She turned to Ranma. "Now, what of this  Kuonji girl? What has become of the engagement with her?"</p><p>Ranma blinked. He just realized that he had  never really settled that before he left for China. He hadn't seen Ukyo in  almost four years...</p><p>'Die Ranma Saotome!'</p><p>'C-cute?'</p><p>'Ranchan!'</p><p>'One special comin right up, just for you  honey!'</p><p>'R-Ranma? What happened! Are you okay?'</p><p>'Ranchan...'</p><p>"Well...I guess I'm still engaged to her  since the engagement was never broken..." Ranma said with uncertainty.  "...and I owe her at least that since Pop took her dowry."</p><p>Nodoka pondered on that for a moment, before  nodding. "Both engagements appear valid so I will handle Kuonji's  engagement the same as I will handle the Tendos. I will contact her  shortly."</p><p>Ranma smiled inwardly to himself and nodded.</p><p>"Come Ranma, we will meet with the  Tendos," Nodoka said, standing up. Ranma followed suit.</p><p>Genma was about to do the same, but Nodoka  stopped him with a glare, her handle unconsciously petting her katana that was  sheathed in her arms. Genma gulped as he eyed the weapon with uncertainty.  "YOU will be staying here as punishment until I deem otherwise. Let us go,  son."</p><p>Ranma and Nodoka exited the Saotome house,  leaving Genma still sitting at the table alone to think about the events that  had happened.</p><p>'Bringing Ranma from China -Saotome' Soun  read the letter once more to make sure he was seeing right. As he did, tears  flowed down his cheeks. "Oh, at long last the schools shall be united!  Kasumi!"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Nabiki!"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Akane!...Akane? Oh where is she?"</p><p>"I'll go get her, daddy."</p><p>"Thank you, Nabiki. I have an important  family matter to discuss."</p><p>Nabiki walked over to the dojo to see her  sister smashing cinder blocks.</p><p>"KYAA!" Akane cried out as her fist  connected with the block.</p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>Akane looked up finally from her training.  "Yeah?"</p><p>"Dad wants to talk with us. He says it's  an 'important family matter'." Nabiki walked out and returned to the  living room with Akane following her.</p><p>"I wonder what it could be?" Akane  asked curiously.</p><p>Nabiki shrugged in reply. "Who  knows."</p><p>Soun had a grand smile on his face as he  looked at all three of his daughters. "The day has finally come!"</p><p>Nabiki raised her eyebrow questioningly. It  wasn't a common thing for her father to be so eccentric. "What day would  that be, daddy?"</p><p>"The day for the schools to be  united!" Soun replied happily. "Years ago, I made a pact with an old  friend of mine that we would arrange a marriage between our children to  continue the legacy of the Anything Goes Martial Arts."</p><p>The Tendo sisters gasped at the announcement.</p><p>"Oh my!"</p><p>"Daddy, you didn't..."</p><p>"How could you engage us to some...some  BOY!"</p><p>Ignoring his daughters conveniently, he  continued, saying, "And now that day is here! Saotome sent me a letter  saying that he was bringing his son, Ranma, here from China!"</p><p>Nabiki perked up at that, thinking maybe this  wouldn't be a lose-lose situation after all. "Ooh, China! How  exotic!" Nabiki suddenly blinked as she realized the name her father had  just said. Raising an eyebrow, she thought to herself, 'Saotome? That sounds  vaguely familiar.'</p><p>Kasumi blinked too, wondering, 'Ranma? That  couldn't be that kind man I met years ago could it?' She never did learn his  last name.</p><p>Turning her attention back to her father,  Nabiki asked, "What does this Ranma look like? Is he cute?"</p><p>"How old is he?" Kasumi asked.  "I hope he's older than me."</p><p>"Hmph! Who cares about some boy!"  Akane said indignantly. "They're all the same: perverts!"</p><p>Soun sweated at their inquires. "Um, I  don't know, I've never met him."</p><p>"Oh Father..." Kasumi trailed off,  a disappointment evident in her eyes.</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. "You're kidding  me..."</p><p>"You engaged us to some BOY you don't  even know!" Akane asked in outrage. She wondered how the situation could  possibly get worse.</p><p>Soun held up his hands in a calming gesture.  "N-now don't worry, I'm sure he's a strong, young martial artist, just  like his father-"</p><p>He stopped as he heard the doorbell ring and  a door slide open. "Oh, that must be them!" Soun exclaimed.</p><p>"I will go greet our guests,  father," Kasumi said with her usual smile. She returned shortly with an  older woman and a young man. The woman wore a traditional autumn kimono and  carried a long katana wrapped in cloth. The young man was wearing a red long  sleeve chinese shirt with black silk pants. He had his hair in a pigtail and  one simple earring in his right ear.</p><p>"Hello...who are you people?" Soun  asked. He had been expecting to see Genma.</p><p>The woman bowed. "Hello. I am Nodoka  Saotome and this is my son, Ranma."</p><p>Ranma had an overly serious expression on his  face. He had to make a good impression after all. He nodded his head he  slightly and tried to appear suave, saying, "Yo- ow!" Rubbing the  back of his head, he saw the admonishing look on his mother's face. Quickly  remembering his manners, he bowed and said, "Hello." He always forgot  to mind his manners around his mother, although she did have an odd sense of  what seemed proper. Nodoka didn't seem to Ranma's flirtatious and peeping  nature and often spouted of wanting grandkids, which wasn't exactly what he had  in mind. No where near that actually.</p><p>Ranma never took his flirts too far and  always remained playful. This was mainly because he simply had no experience of  anything past that. He had never been in a serious, or at least seriously  physical, relationship before; the old lech had never taught him that part.  That was also probably part of the reason Ranma was so susceptible to his  perverted nature; he had a lot of pent up sexual energy. For nearly all of  Ranma's life, girls had either been afraid of him or really angry with him.  With the exception of China that is, but that was one place where his methods  didn't work there. Ranma preferred to do the chasing, not the other way around.</p><p>"Ranma? At last, the schools will be  united!" Soun, with tears in his eyes. He glomped on to Ranma, taking him  into a strong bear hug.</p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p>Nodoka raised an eyebrow at Soun's odd  gesture. 'What an...interesting man,' she thought.</p><p>Blinking, Soun held Ranma at arms length to  further inspect the young man. It felt like he had just hugged a rock. Smiling,  he said, "My, what a strong young martial artist you are! You'll make a  fine groom for my daughters!"</p><p>"Dad!" Akane cried out. She glared  at Ranma hatefully, resisting the urge to pummel the invading boy. He hadn't  done anything yet, but she was sure, like all boys, Ranma would soon try to do  something perverted to her or one of her sisters. Akane would be ready for that  when the time came.</p><p>Nabiki had one of her mischievous smiles planted  on her face. "Ooh, he is cute!" she cooed. Maybe she could make the  best out of this deal yet. Ranma was certainly a fine specimen with his well  tone muscles and gentle, yet strong facial features.</p><p>Kasumi stood back quietly with a light blush  on her cheeks. This man certainly was older, and appeared to be mature, which  wasn't what she was expecting.</p><p>Ranma, hearing Nabiki's comment, turned his  attention to the middle daughter. Immediately as he admired her figure, he took  up a lecherous grin, a red tinge crossing his cheeks. She was wearing a similar  kimono to his mothers, but it looked a bit more intricate. The way the cloth  hugged every curve of her body was absolutely amazing. He turned his gaze to  Akane, who was wearing a yellow gi. Ranma could tell she had been working out  by the way her skin glistened softly in the moonlight, accented her feminine  features. The gi hung rather loosely, giving him a nice view. Lastly, he looked  towards Kasumi. She wore a simple blue dress with an apron on top. She too was  a sight for sore eyes as her dress gently caressed her body. Unlike Akane,  Kasumi was had a more mature, gentle figure, though without the finesse that  Nabiki possessed.</p><p>He noticed all this within an instance and  the lecherous grin disappearing as quickly as it had appeared. A martial artist  should never give away the fact that he is analyzing his opponent.</p><p>No one noticed except for Nabiki, who had  long mastered the art of human emotion and manipulation. 'Did he just...?' To  make sure, she flashed Ranma a sultry smile and was immediately rewarded with  the result she expected. The grin that all males possessed. Nabiki smirked.  'This might be easier than expected.'</p><p>"Please come inside, Saotome-san."  Kasumi gestured into the living room where the Tendos were seated.</p><p>Remembering his manners, Soun nodded.  "Yes, yes, please, come in. We have much to talk about."</p><p>"Please, call me Auntie Nodoka,"  Nodoka said, smiling at Kasumi. Kasumi returned the smile and nodded.</p><p>Once everyone was seated at the table, Soun  spoke the question that had been on his mind for a while now. "Where is my  old friend, Genma?"</p><p>"He is at our house and will remain so  until I see that he repented for his actions," Nodoka said calmly.</p><p>The Tendos blinked in confusion.</p><p>Ranma grimaced at the mention of his father.  "Don't ask," he said before they could say anything.</p><p>"I see," Soun said, before  continuing, "These are my three daughters: Akane, age 17, Nabiki, age 18,  and Kasumi, age 20. Pick any one of them to become your fiancé."</p><p>A split second after hearing this, Ranma, the  lecherous grin and pink blush on his face, said with glee, "Don't mind if  I- er, I mean-"</p><p>"HEY!" Akane screamed in outrage.  "Don't we get any say in this! I don't want to be married to this...this  boy!"</p><p>Ranma, assuming his best puppy dog  impression, whined, "But Akane-chaaan..."</p><p>Akane's eye twitched. "Don't call me  that you pervert!"</p><p>Kasumi hesitated on what to say. She did have  a duty to maintain the harmony of the Tendo household as well as upholding  their family honor. Not only that, but Ranma was a handsome man that was older  than her...</p><p>The eldest daughter didn't get a chance to  say anything however, as Nabiki took that moment's hesitation to speak. Nabiki  smiled at Ranma playfully. "Well, if you don't want him sis, I'll take  him." Nabiki intertwined her arm with Ranma's. With a hunk like this,  she'd be making major money in no time.</p><p>Ranma nodded vigorously at Nabiki with a  hearty smile on his face. "Sounds good to me!"</p><p>Nodoka smiled blissfully to herself. "Oh  my son is so manly!"</p><p>"NABIKI!" Akane said, shocked.</p><p>"It's settled then! Ranma, Nabiki is now  your new fiancé! We'll have the wedding scheduled as soon as-"</p><p>Nodoka held up her hand, stopping Soun.  "Hold it. My husband made this pact without my consent, there for I have  every to nullify this engagement because I am the head of the Saotome  household." Seeing Soun's tears running, she continued before he let out  another one of his emotional outbursts. "However, in order to maintain  both families honor, I will allow this engagement, but on my terms. I will not  force my son into a loveless marriage. Ranma will stay within your household  for an extended period of time so he can get to know ALL your daughters, in  case it doesn't work out with Nabiki. Are these terms acceptable,  Tendo-san?"</p><p>Soun halted his tears for a moment and  thought. Although this wasn't his ideal arrangement, it was better than  nothing. He nodded. "Yes, yes they are."</p><p>Ranma looked at his mother in surprise.  Although he had only known her for a few years, he knew that honor was very  important to her. He didn't think that she would actually care about his  feelings on the matter. Now Ranma felt guilty. He had to remind himself that  his mother was not Genma.</p><p>Nodoka, noticing Ranma's expression, smiled  at him fondly. She would not lose her son again, not after so long.</p><p>"So, basically that means..."  Nabiki started slowly, "that all three of us are his fiancés until he  picks one of us or time's up?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "That's correct."</p><p>"Oh my!" Kasumi said, surprised,  and maybe just a tiny bit happy.</p><p>Ranma had a blissful look on his face. 'This  has to be a dream!'</p><p>"I can't believe this!" Akane  finally cried out. Not only was this boy now going to be engaged to all THREE  of them, but she actually had to LIVE with him! She wouldn't have it. Pointing  at Ranma menacingly, Akane said, "Ranma Saotome, I challenge you!"</p><p>Ranma, still contemplating how he had finally  gotten so lucky after all this time, blinked at Akane in surprise.  "Eh?"</p><p>Akane grabbed his sleeve roughly and lead him  to the dojo. "Come on!" The rest of the Tendos, plus Nodoka, followed  them.</p><p>Akane stood opposing Ranma in a fighting  stance. "If I win, you have to take back the engagement!"</p><p>Ranma scratched the back of his head. "Er...but  I don't like fighting girls..." He resisted a shudder at the thought of  his bad experiences.</p><p>"Why not! Are you scared?" Akane  taunted.</p><p>"Am I...WHAT!" He couldn't believe  this girl. What nerve she had. "Okay, fine! I, Ranma Saotome of the  Saotome Anything Goes Martial Arts, accept!"</p><p>This guy might look pretty good, but Akane  was another matter. "Don't hurt him too badly sis," Nabiki said.</p><p>"Oh my..." Kasumi sighed. Why did  she always have to be so violent? She hoped Akane went easy on Ranma...</p><p>"Akaneee! Why must you do this!"  Soun's heart was wrenched in two as he cried. On one hand, the engagement and  the future of the schools was in danger. On the other hand, his little girl  might get hurt.</p><p>Nodoka just smiled at the two.  "Ranma."</p><p>Ranma nodded knowingly. "I know,  mom." Turning back to Akane. "What do I get if I win?"</p><p>"Um, I'll...I'll accept the engagement  and never try to break it again," Akane stated hesitantly. Still, she had  nothing to worry about. There was no way some boy would beat her anyways.</p><p>"Okay," Ranma said, nodding.  "Ready when you are." He stood back in a relaxed stance, arms at his  side. He didn't want to hurt her. She was kind of cute she got mad. Besides,  she was just a girl after all.</p><p>Akane's eyebrows curved inward. 'Doesn't  think I'm strong does he? I'll show him!' She shot forward and launched a  series of punches. Ranma dodged each one with a fluid motion, swerving left and  right. 'Why can't I hit him? Is he reading my moves?' As each of her attacks  hit the air, Akane began to get agitated. "Stand still and fight me!"</p><p>Ranma glanced as his mother for a second and,  after seeing her nod, began to make his move.</p><p>Although Ranma was dodging every attack, she  had managed to get him into a corner. 'Time to get serious!' Akane pulled back  her fist in preparation. "KYAA!" With all her might, she extended  her fist towards Ranma but found he had already ducked under attack.</p><p>Ranma, using Akane's momentum, gently swept Akane  off her feet, sending her to the ground. He crouched and offered her a hand.  "Are you okay?"</p><p>"Wow..." Nabiki murmured. This  engagement was turning out to be better than she expected.</p><p>Akane said nothing. She was speechless.  She...she had lost? And to a boy? She hadn't even laid a finger on him.  Standing up, Akane slapped Ranma's hand away. "Leave me alone!" She  quickly ran off to her room. Ranma was about to follow her, but was stopped by  Nabiki's hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Don't worry about Akane, she's just a  bit upset," Nabiki explained to him. "She'll be fine in the morning  once she's calmed down."</p><p>Ranma scratched his head uncomfortably, but  conceded reluctantly.</p><p>Kasumi, seeing Ranma's discomfort, said,  "I'll show you to your room Ranma-san."</p><p>"Ah just call me Ranma," he said,  following her inside.</p><p>"Well now, I suppose I should be getting  back home," Nodoka said, on her way out. "I'll return in a few days  with my husband."</p><p>Everyone went to their respective rooms to  sleep.</p><p>Tap tap.</p><p>Tap tap.</p><p>Akane gradually opened her eyes after hearing  a tapping noise noise on her window. She blinked in surprise as she saw Ranma  hanging upside down outside. Remembering she was angry with him, Akane glared  as she opened the window. "What do you want Ranma? Do you have any idea  what time it is!"</p><p>"Er, well I just wanted to  apologize-"</p><p>"For what? For making me look like an  idiot?"</p><p>"But Akane-chaaan..."</p><p>Akane's eye twitched. She hated when he did  that. "Don't call me that!"</p><p>Ranma looked down at the floor. "I'm  sorry..." He really didn't want her to hate him and he hated leaving  things unfinished. While the idea of apologizing didn't sit well with him, he  had learned that any sacrifice was well worth it when a girl was involved.</p><p>Seeing sad expression, Akane clenched her  teeth angrily as she reluctantly thought of forgiving him. Ranma hadn't really  done anything except beat her and the engagement hadn't been his idea.  "Fine. I forgive you...Now get out of my room you pervert!" she said,  punching at him. Even if it wasn't his idea, that still didn't mean he had to  be so happy about the whole thing, that pervert,' she thought to herself.</p><p>Dodging the punch, he hopped out of the room,  saying, "Yay! Thanks!"</p><p>Akane sighed. Things were definitely going to  be different now with Ranma around now.</p><p>It was a new morning as Kasumi headed  downstairs, her mind still on the young Saotome now staying in the house. She  looked outside in surprise as she saw Ranma practicing a kata. Usually she was  the only one up at this time in the morning.</p><p>"Ohayogozaimasu, Ranma," she  greeted him with a smile.</p><p>Ranma's nostrils flared as he once again  admired Kasumi's figure. Living with three beautiful girls was going to take  some getting used to. Remembering she had said something, Ranma replied,  "O-Ohayo, Kasumi-chan."</p><p>Kasumi blushed slightly at her name being  said in such a manner. They had only just met yesterday. No one had ever called  her that before.</p><p>Ranma, realizing his habit, scratched the  back of his head and said, "Er, sorry, is it okay if I call you that? It's  kind of a habit I have with my students."</p><p>Kasumi, still slightly embarrassed, simply  smiled and nodded. "It's okay. What do you mean by your students?"</p><p>Ranma grinned and stuck out his chest  proudly. "I'm a school teacher! I teach high school students."</p><p>"You're a teacher?" Kasumi asked  with surprised. She had no idea. Ranma hadn't seemed the teacher type, she  assumed he was talking about teaching martial arts. A mature, older man that  was not only a formidable martial artist but a schoolteacher as well. Had this  not been type of man she had always dreamed about? Not only that, but she could  be engaged to him. However, now that Kasumi had such a man within her grasp,  she was unsure of what to do with him.</p><p>Ranma nodded to Kasumi's question, saying,  "Yup! I gotta go get ready now."</p><p>"Okay. I'll get breakfast ready in a  moment."</p><p>"Great!"</p><p>Nabiki woke up. She got out of bed and made  her way to the living room.</p><p>"Ohayo, Nabiki," Kasumi greeted her  as she served Ranma food.</p><p>"Ohayo," she yawned. Halting in her  steps, Nabiki quickly remembered the events of last night she had forgotten.  She saw her family all seated at the table and Kasumi serving breakfast. Ranma,  surprisingly, was wearing a nice looking white suit with a gray shirt  underneath and a black tie on top. Nabiki smirked at Ranma and said playfully,  "Hello dear fiancé. You look nice today."</p><p>The lecherous grin took over Ranma's face for  a second. "You look beautiful in the morning, Nabiki-chan!" Ranma  complimented her shamelessly, forgetting himself.</p><p>Nabiki blushed at his statement. She was not  a self-conscious girl and was not usually concerned about her appearance most  of the time. She knew she was fairly decent looking, especially when she wanted  to be, but she hadn't expected that. Nabiki then realized just what her current  appearance looked like. Her hair was a mess and her pajama top hung loosely off  her shoulders, revealing quite a bit of cleavage. Quickly straightening out her  clothes, she said, "Um, thanks."</p><p>"Stop hitting on my sister, you  pervert!" Akane said angrily, wanting to hit Ranma. And here she had  thought being called Akane-chan was special. 'That casanova!' she muttered in  her mind.</p><p>"Why?" Ranma asked. Nabiki was his  fiancé after all. "Do ya want me to hit on you instead?"</p><p>"OF COURSE NOT!" Akane cried out,  ready to hit him.</p><p>"Oh they're getting along so well!"  Soun said, crying. "I'm so happy! It won't be long before the schools are  united now."</p><p>Kasumi just smiled her usual smile.</p><p>"Why are you wearing that suit anyways  Ranma?" Nabiki asked curiously.</p><p>"For work. I don't really wanna but it  comes in the job description," he said, shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>Nabiki blinked with surprise. Ranma actually  had a job? That was unexpected. He didn't seem the responsible type, plus he  didn't seem that old. "You have a job?"</p><p>Ranma nodded proudly. "Yup, I start  today. Ack, I gotta go! Don't wanna be late!" Quickly finishing his meal,  he stood up and took off out the door.</p><p>"Itterasshai!" Kasumi called out to  Ranma's departed figure.</p><p>Ranma, hearing that, popped his head back  into the room. That had been the first time in a long time that he had heard  that. Smiling, he Ranma replied, "Ittekimasu."</p><p>"Great, now I'm going to be late! And  it's all because of YOUR fiancé," Akane huffed.</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. "It's not his  fault you forgot about the time."</p><p>"Hmph! I...HATE...BOYS!" Akane  cried out as she rushed through the gates of Furinkan. The battle begun.</p><p>"Akane, will you go on a date with  me!"</p><p>"I love you Akane!"</p><p>"This is for you, Akane!"</p><p>Ranma, peering down at the fight below,  immediately ran to aid Akane. 'What kind of school is this?' he wondered to  himself. "Hey, Nabiki," he said as he passed her on his way outside.</p><p>Nabiki blinked. "Ranma...? What's he  doing here?"</p><p>"HYAA!" She kicked another  assailant in the face and sent him sprawling into the concrete.</p><p>"Aaah!"</p><p>"Hey, who is this guy?"</p><p>Akane looked over to see Ranma attacking some  the boys. She glared at him angrily. Walking over to him, she said, "I  don't need your help, Ranma!"</p><p>"Eh? But I can't help it! As a teacher,  and a martial artist, there ain't no way I'm gonna let this continue!"  Ranma said firmly. He usually never fought with students, but Ranma could make  an exception this time and say he was taking disciplinary actions as an excuse  in case he got in trouble.</p><p>The students watched from above with  curiosity. Who was this new man? Did he just say he was a teacher? Nabiki was  also one of those wondering.</p><p>"You there!" a student dressed in a  hakama said. "Who are you to speak so casually with the noble Akane  Tendo?"</p><p>"I'm-"</p><p>"Wait, is it not customary for one to  give his name first?" the young man cut in rudely. "I am Tatewaki  Kuno, captain of the Furinkan kendo club, age 18. I am also known as Blue  Thunder of Furinkan High!" Thunder could be heard in the distance. The  students murmured among themselves.</p><p>"Blue Thunder?"</p><p>"That's a new one."</p><p>"Wasn't he Shooting Star last  week?"</p><p>Ranma, not impressed at all, said, "Well  I'm Ranma Saotome of the Anything Goes Martial Arts, what's it to you  buddy?"</p><p>"What is it to me?" Kuno said in  indignation. "I'll tell what it is to me! No one but I shall be allowed to  converse with Akane Tendo for I am the only one worthy of such an honor. You,  on the other hand, are not!"</p><p>"I'm not worthy?" Ranma said  curiously. "I have more right because I'm en-" Something clicked in  Ranma's mind as he figured out the implications of what he was about to say.  Here he was, a new, young teacher, engaged to a student. He could imagine what  the administration's reaction would be. There was no doubt that he'd be fired  and lose all face.</p><p>Ranma hopped backwards quickly and said,  "Er, can you not saying about the engagement to anyone?"</p><p>"Hmph, that's perfectly fine with me.  Why should I care," Akane said. The less she had to do with Ranma, the  better.</p><p>"Enough of this!" Kuno stated.  "Have at thee!" He vaulted towards Ranma with the point of his  bokken. Ranma back flipped out of the way smoothly.</p><p>"What are you doing you idiot? I can  take care of Kuno myself!" Akane said.</p><p>"Hey, I'm not the one who started it!  'sides, it ain't right for a guy to attack a girl like this," Ranma replied,  dodging another slash.</p><p>"You're going to get hurt! Kuno's a lot  better than you think."</p><p>'Me, get hurt? From this clown?' Ranma  thought to himself, his pride a bit hurt. 'I'll show he- ack!' His thoughts  were cut off as he barely escaped an air pressure slash that cracked the bark  of the tree behind him. Maybe he wasn't that bad, but he was in no way a match  for Ranma. 'Time to end this, it's almost time for class to start,' Ranma  thought.</p><p>"Stand still fiend!"</p><p>Ranma smirked. "Sure." He stood  with his feet planted in the ground, even as Kuno's strike raced towards him.  The instance before his bokken hit Ranma, Ranma's flashed out and snatched it  in mid air. At the same time, he flipped back slowly while striking Kuno in the  torso with his foot. Each strike hit a precise pressure point, but they were  done in such a quick, fluid manner that most people wouldn't of even seen the  kicks. After landing on his feat, Ranma grinned confidently at his downed  opponent.</p><p>"Arrogant jerk..." Akane muttered  as she went inside.</p><p>Nabiki walked up to Kuno's departed form and  admonished his easy defeat. "Kuno-chan, you should of known better not to  mess with my fiancé," she said, smiling at Ranma.</p><p>Ranma scratched the back of his head. "Heheh,  what can I say? Oh yeah, about that fiancé thing, do you think you could keep  quite about that and not tell anyone?"</p><p>"What for?" Nabiki asked. She had  been hoping to flaunt her new trophy to everyone.</p><p>"Well since I'm a teacher here, I'm not  really allowed to have that kind of relationship with a student. Anyways, I'll  see you at home, I'm late for class!" Ranma said, running inside.</p><p>Nabiki blinked. "He's a  teacher...?" she thought, before dragging Kuno's limp body inside.</p><p>Ranma stopped hesitantly at the door to his  class. 'This is it...my first class as a real teacher. A real one, not a  student teacher.' He grinned lecherously. 'My teaching legacy filled with  young, cute sixteen year olds begins now!' He opened the door.</p><p>"Good morning students, sorry I'm  late!" Ranma said as he walked in. 'Eh?' Was it just him or was it getting  really hot in here?</p><p>Ranma formed a large sweatdrop in the back of  his head as he realized that more than half of the them were the same students  he had just beat up a minute ago, outside. The classroom was deathly silent as  the students glared at Ranma in spite. Looking for some comfort, he quickly  glanced around the room for any cute schoolgirls. Not one in sight. The the  majority of the class was boys and there were only a couple of not-so-hot  looking girls in the back of the class wearing long skirts.</p><p>Coughing nervously, Ranma said, "I'm  Saotome-sensei. Sorry about this."</p><p>"WHAT? I WILL NOT HAVE IT!" Kuno  fumed. "I will not allow that cur to be a teacher here!"</p><p>The teacher threw a piece of chalk at Kuno's  head. "Sit down right now!"</p><p>Nabiki grinned to herself, casually playing  with the money Kuno had just given her. Although feeling slightly guilty at  selling out her fiancé, she reasoned that one: Kuno would have found out  eventually anyways and two: given the display of skill that Ranma had shown, she  was pretty sure he could handle himself. Besides, it was business.</p><p>Ranma Saotome was in hell. For the last hour,  he had been barely able to restrain himself from killing all of them as they  assaulted him with verbal taunts. Unlike outside, he couldn't use the  disciplinary excuse because they hadn't done anything physical to him yet.  Ranma clenched his fist angrily. 'Why if I wasn't a teacher...if I wasn't a  teacher I'd...' he kept thinking to himself in a rage.</p><p>"Hey sensei, why are you making a fist  like that?"</p><p>"What's the matter? You wanna hit  someone?"</p><p>Ranma forced himself to remain silent.</p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p>"Go ahead!"</p><p>One of the arrogant punks pointed innocently  to his cheek. "What's the matter? You can't do it? Come on, hit me right  here. It'll hurt the most if you hit my face right here," he said in a  mocking tone.</p><p>The class laughed at Ranma's predicament as  his fist shook in anger. "Yeah, hit me as much as you want! Go ahead and  use all your strength. No need to hold back."</p><p>"But if you hit us this time, you'll be  kicked out for sure!" another said, laughing.</p><p>"You might even be in the  news! Teacher abuses students. Unbelievable scandal.  The truth about the violent classroom revealed!"</p><p>'Must...restrain...self...' Ranma kept  thinking to himself while gritting his teeth. Veins were popping out of his  forehead by now. The door burst open suddenly.</p><p>"I WILL NOT HAVE IT! I will not allow  you to be a teacher here!" Kuno cried out and slashed at Ranma.</p><p>'I'M SAVED!' Ranma thought in glee, barely  able to hold himself back from crying in happiness. "Hah! Bring it on,  Kuno!" he said, hopping out the classroom and running down the halls.</p><p>"Come back here coward!" Kuno said,  chasing after him.</p><p>'Man, what a day...' Ranma thought to himself  as he walked to the teacher's lounge. He had a meeting to attend now that the  school day was over. 'Why do these always happen to me?' Although Kuno had  managed to save him from that class, he did have to go back eventually which  wasn't fun. Not fun at all.</p><p>"Hello. You must be the new  teacher."</p><p>Ranma looked up from his pondering to see a cute  young woman, probably around the same age as himself, greeting him. She had  smooth brown hair that went down the nape of her neck and wore a blue miniskirt  with a tan blouse. A blush formed on his cheeks as his eyes rolled over her  body.</p><p>"Ah, h-hello, yeah I am," Ranma  said, a bit surprised to see such a young teacher here. He had been used to  working with middle-aged men and women.</p><p>She bowed slightly and said, "I'm Azusa  Fuyutsuki, pleased to meet you."</p><p>Regaining his composure, Ranma said while  grinning confidently, "I'm Ranma Saotome, nice to meet ya too."  Seeing Fuyutsuki sitting down, he realized the meeting was about to start and  sat down at his new desk. Most of the teachers gave no indication that they had  seen Ranma fighting outside in the morning. They had just assumed it was Akane  doing her usually thing with the principal's son and his lackeys.</p><p>Ranma tuned out most of the meeting while he  stole glances at Fuyutsuki the entire time. 'At last, a cute teacher!  Fuyutsuki-chan...' he sighed in pleasure as dirty thoughts came into his mind.</p><p>"...and that concludes today's meeting.  Also, be sure to greet Furinkan's new teacher, Saotome-san," the vice  principal said. Ranma wondered to himself where the headmaster was. He hadn't  ever seen him before even when he was interviewed. Shrugging to himself, he  stood up to greet the other teachers coming to him. Once they left, Ranma made  happily his way over to Fuyutsuki who was packing up her things.</p><p>"You going home now, Fuyutsuki-chan?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>Fuyutsuki nodded at his question. "I  have a lot of homework to correct."</p><p>"Wanna go out to eat first?"</p><p>Fuyutsuki blinked and blushed. Ranma  certainly was friendly. 'Had Saotome-san just asked her out,' she wondered.  "Um, Saotome-san...?"</p><p>"Er, I mean," Ranma started to say,  waving his hands defensively with a blush on his face. He realized it had just  sounded like he had asked her out on a date. "As friends, colleagues! I  was gonna call up my other friend to see if he wanted to come too."</p><p>"Oh," Fuyutsuki said, her blush  retracting. It HAD been a while since she had been on a date, but this would of  been too fast for her. "I can't today, Saotome-san, sorry. I really do  have a lot of work to correct," she said regretfully.</p><p>"Ah that's okay, heheh," Ranma  said, a bit disappointed. "Oh well, maybe some other time huh?"  Fuyutsuki nodded. "By the way, just call me Ranma."</p><p>Nodding again, Fuyutsuki smiled and said,  "Okay, Ranma-kun. I'll see you tomorrow."</p><p>"Yeah, see ya tomorrow," Ranma  replied, waving. He sighed. Although he was looking forward to seeing Fuyutsuki  tomorrow, he was NOT looking forward to teaching that class full of little  demons.</p><p>"Tadaima," Ranma said, making his  way into the living room.</p><p>"Okaerinasai," Kasumi replied with  her cheery smile. "You're just in time for dinner."</p><p>Ranma's stomach growled softly at the mention  of food. 'Just what I needed.' He had forgotten to bring any food or money with  him so he had to forgo lunch. He supposed he could asked Akane or Nabiki for  some food, but then concluded it would look a bit weird to others if the  sisters shared their lunch with him, a new teacher. 'I could get used to this,'  Ranma thought, smiling to himself. When was the last time he had a place he  could call home? Sure, China had been nice and, sure, he could of always lived  with his mom, but it was this warm feeling Ranma received when he returned to  the Tendo Dojo that had been missing.</p><p>"How come you didn't tell us you taught  at our high school, Ranma?" Akane asked.</p><p>Shrugging, Ranma replied, "I dunno,  never occurred to me. I didn't know you two went there."</p><p>"You're a school teacher Ranma?" Soun  asked in genuine surprise. He hadn't of thought that Saotome would of put much  emphasis on education. He'd have to ask his old friend about that later.</p><p>Ranma nodded as he ate.</p><p>"Your just full of surprises aren't  you?" Nabiki said. "You even fought, and beat, Kuno on your first  day."</p><p>"Yeah..." Ranma trailed off, not  really wanting to speak about how horrible his first day was. As much as he  hated to admit, the poetry spouting fool of a student had actually been one the  better incidents that had had happened to Ranma. Compared to those grueling  hours of that horrifying class anyways. Meeting the beauty Fuyutsuki was also  another plus.</p><p>"Hmph, anyone can beat Kuno," Akane  said, a bit miffed at Ranma's display of skill. "I beat him everyday."</p><p>"That's only because when a girl fights  a guy, he usually lets up a lot," Ranma said, oblivious that he was  indirectly insulting Akane.</p><p>"What? That's ridiculous!"</p><p>"Hey, I'm only telling the truth."</p><p>"Are you saying Kuno's better than  me?"</p><p>"Oh boy, here we go again," Nabiki  said, rolling her eyes. Ranma and Akane just didn't mesh well at all. She  excused herself to her room.</p><p>Ranma nodded to Akane. "Yeah, I think  so."</p><p>"WHAT?" Akane cried out angrily,  raising her fist threateningly. That was a ridiculous notion, Kuno better than  her? She always beat Kuno. Although, he did seem a tiny bit better when he  fought Ranma...Akane quickly shook such an idea out of her head.</p><p>"Aww, don't be mad at me  Akane-chan," Ranma said, cringing. The only thing he hated to see more  than an angry female (silently shuddered at the memories of the old freak's  training) was one that was crying.</p><p>"Don't call me that!" Akane punched  Ranma over the head. "Jerk," Akane muttered.</p><p>"Oww..." Ranma rubbed his head and  watched Akane walk away.</p><p>Soun just laughed at their antics. "Just  like a married couple already!"</p><p>"Yeah right...Hey Kasumi-chan, can I  help you clean up?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh, no that's okay, you're our guest  after all..." Kasumi began.</p><p>Ranma waved it off. "Ah it ain't no big  deal, I don't wanna leech off you guys."</p><p>"Okay, if you insist," Kasumi said  with a smile.</p><p>Ranma walked up the stairs with an envelope  in his hand. Stopping once he reached Nabiki's room, he knocked on the door.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"It's me, Ranma."</p><p>"Oh, come in."</p><p>As he opened the door, Ranma was rewarded  with the view of Nabiki in her very short shorts and a green blouse that  revealed her shoulders. She was on her bed reading a book with her long, smooth  legs moving up and down in the air. A tiny bit a drool escaped Ranma's lips as  he watched her.</p><p>Nabiki looked up from her book after a  moment. Noticing his gaze, she smirked and asked, "Like what you see  Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma gulped. "Um, yeah, eheheh,"  he managed, laughing nervously and unsure of how to handle a situation like  this.</p><p>'He's so fun to play with,' Nabiki thought to  herself. "So what can I do for you, fiancé?"</p><p>"This is an advance payment for my  temporary stay here," Ranma said, handing her the envelope.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she counted the money.  This would pay for at least four or five months. Nabiki wondered if her fiancé  was rich, but dispelled that idea after thinking about. She was pretty sure  Ranma's family wasn't rich, but where else would he have been able to acquire  such a large amount? 'I guess he could of worked while he was China,' Nabiki thought  to herself, shrugging inwardly. Still...she felt a bit guilty about taking so  much from her fiancé. Just a little bit.</p><p>"Um...you don't have to pay me this  much..." Nabiki began to say while hating herself for it.</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "Nah, it's okay.  By the looks of it, I know your dad probably doesn't work or take any students.  You're the only one supporting the family financially right? Just take  it."</p><p>Nabiki nodded, inwardly sighing in relief.</p><p>Ranma's eye narrowed as he saw something on  her desk. 'Pictures of Akane...? Wait a sec...'</p><p>Ranma coughed in his hand bashfully and said,  "Ah, um...if you wanted pictures of me, you could of just asked me for  one."</p><p>'What's he talking about...? AHH!' Nabiki  quickly ran over to her desk and gathered up the pictures. 'How could of I have  been so careless?' she thought, pondering on what excuse she could use. Ranma  had only just met her so Nabiki highly doubted that he knew of her business.  "Um, yeah, I'll be sure to remember that."</p><p>"Well I'll see ya tomorrow  Nabiki-chan," Ranma said on his way out. "'night."</p><p>"Goodnight Ranma."</p><p>V1.4</p><p>-This is just to help me keep track of how updated the story posted is.  Fixed most of the grammatical/spelling errors and changed format again.</p><p>JAPANESE DEFINITIONS:</p><p>"-san": Mr., Ms., Mrs., Miss.; The suffix denoting that the person  being spoken to is of equal or nearly equal social status. It is not used  for people you know well.</p><p>"-kun": familiar title after name of colleague or student, usually  male. Used for male friends and relatives. It can be used for women as well,  but typically is not.</p><p>"-sama": an honorable suffix used for royalty ("Lord",  "Sir")</p><p>"-chan": cute; baby talk. Children who grow up together may keep  using the -chan honorific into adulthood. For close friends and relatives,  especially female ones.</p><p>"-sempai": one's senior (colleague, fellow student).;  Upperclassman, or more generally somebody in the same social class but superior  to you (ex, 'Kuno-sempai')</p><p>"Ohayogozaimasu": polite way to say "Good morning"</p><p>"Ohayo": means "Good morning"</p><p>"Itterasshai": used to a family member when he or she leaves the  house. Used to express their hope that family members will come back to the  house safely.</p><p>"Ittekimasu": reply to itterasshai, means "I'll be back"</p><p>"Tadaima": means "I'm home"</p><p>"Okaeri": reply to tadaima, means "Welcome home"</p><p>"Okaerinasai": polite form of "Welcome home"</p><p>"Sensei": teacher, master</p><p>AUTHOR'S NOTES:</p><p>Email:</p><p>This is a fusion crossover, meaning that the  GTO and Ranma universes have been combined into one world. If you've watched  GTO, you've probably noticed by now that Ranma definitely has some Onizuka  personality in him. I'd say this Ranma is about 2/5 of Onizuka and 3/5 of the  normal Ranma.</p><p>If you're wondering if Ranma's cursed, he  isn't, even though Ranma did train in China. Really though, anyone who has a  brain (this Ranma) in their head isn't gonna get themselves cursed when there's  a guide always there to warn you about the dangers. Only if your stupid Genma),  being punished (Shampoo), totally blind (Mousse), or get forced in (Ryoga),  there's no way you'll get cursed. Besides, there's not much training for Ranma  to do with just a bunch of poles to train with when he's alone. Well, that and  I have a hard time imagining this Ranma turning into a girl and how he would  react.</p><p>This is not a strictly Ranma/Nabiki fic, nor  is it a Ranma/Kasumi or Ranma/Akane fic. I won't restrict myself to thinking  that way. I'll just let things ride and see what comes up along the way so who  knows who he'll end up with.</p>
