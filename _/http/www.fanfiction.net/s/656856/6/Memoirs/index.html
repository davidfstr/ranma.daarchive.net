</div>Memoirs: Chapter 6. The Bitterness of going on. (Epilogue)<p>I awoke with a start and immediately felt along my body to find everything normal. Everything<br/>was in place, no bones were broken, and I wasn't bound.<p>So what the hell had caused that dream? I mean...seriously! Since when was I equipped to love<br/>somebody like Ranma?<p>I quickly arose and tore open the flap to my father's side of our tent.<p>"What the hell are you thinking, old man? Did you slip your secret sauce into my dinner again?"<p>My father roused awake like a bear from hibernation, which really wasn't far from the truth.<p>"Go black to sleep, Ukyo." The snores began again.<p>I hefted my battle spatula and punted the old man out into the open.<p>"Like hell!" I began to attack as soon as he hit the ground.<p>The old man finally woke up. "You're on, Boy!"<p>* * *<p>I woke from the dream with a shriek, only to have Nabiki shyly peek in on me.<p>"So you had it too..." Her voice was soft, nothing like it was in that memory...that dream.<p>I nodded and hugged my sister tightly. "What happened, Nabiki-chan? Who were those people?"<p>My older sister shook her head. "I have no idea, Akane." I saw the tears in her eyes as she turned<br/>her face directly towards mine, at last. "Maybe we should call Kasumi at Tofu's. She'd know what<br/>to do."<p>I nodded at my sister, deriving some comfort from the fact that she was here with me. "We'll call<br/>in the morning,"<p>* * *<p>When I came to I was in a bed, and I was male.<p>I was two-for-two.<p>I sat up, and nothing hurt: I wasn't having a period, there was no gash that revealed my guts, I<br/>wasn't scarred from a final battle, and I was male!<p>I stood up in the small cabin, revelling in my male body, to find that I was sixteen years old again.<p>"Odd. I could've sworn..." I spoke aloud to myself, assuming solitude.<p>"I thought I'd lost you there, boy." Pop's grim voice penetrated the silent air of the small cabin<br/>and proceeded to scare the daylights out of me as he came in from the beautiful spring day that<br/>tantalized me through the makeshift doorway.<p>"Where am I?"<p>"You don't remember?" The old man looked disappointed, so I began to recall the last few days<br/>out loud.<p>"I remember coming home, finding the Kaisui-Fuu, and getting stabbed in the back by Ry-"<p>The old man was giving me an odd stare, so I decided to appease him. "What's wrong, pop? Spit<br/>it out."<p>"We're in the Cursed Training grounds of Juusenkyo Springs, Ranma. You fell into a spring yes-<br/>terday, as did I."<p>"I fell into..."<p>"We had to fish you out of Qipannichuan, Spring of Drowned Hope, sir." The familiar voice of the<br/>Juusenkyo guide piped up as he brought a plate of fish into the cabin and offered me some dinner.<br/>"You are first customer ever to fall into spring of Qipannichuan who make it out with life intact."<br/>The guide gave me a guarded look.<p>"So...I just fell in this spring..." I allowed the joy of the matter to sink in. "So I'm free of the<br/>female side! Yes!"<p>The guide gave Genma a look and left the cabin. The latter of the two gave me a baleful sigh and<br/>pulled up a chair.<p>"Son...I have something to tell you, and this is going to be hard on you."<p>I nodded, knowing that nothing could possibly dampen my mood.<p>* * *<p>As I helped grandmother in her meditation, in order to define the terrible dream we had both awo-<br/>ken from, a horrific scream pierced the evening.<p>""<p>""<p>I got up and grabbed my sword off of its rack, nodding to grandmother, but she stopped me before<br/>I made it to the door.<p>"<p>I gave my grandmother a curt nod and then returned to my cabin to see Mousse.<p>"I am sorry for keeping you for so long, Airen. I must go on a Journey. I believe I know what has<br/>been causing our dreams."<p>My love gently began to push his glasses onto his nose and don his robe in preparation for battle.<p>* * *<p>I methodically punched each post as I strove to regain my concentration. This couldn't be right.<p>"Sir, you first person ever to fall into two springs! This is very special!"<p>Special my ass! Certainly...my last six years of memory had never happened, but I still remem-<br/>bered them.<p>"You see, sir...the spring of drowned hopes causes the person who fall in spring to live whole<br/>nother life. That person will experience worst possible conclusions to every event from that point<br/>on. Very few customers ever come out of spring."<p>Then why the hell did I make it? I would rather have died than to have had this curse still!<p>No...that wasn't true. I had something to live for.<p>"So what about all the people I met?"<p>"They is real people, sir."<p>I grabbed pop by the scruff of the neck.<p>"Here's the deal, pop. We're going to train for another year. You're going to teach me the Umisen-<br/>ken," I perversely enjoyed the old man's look of surprise, "and we're going to go to the Tendo<br/>Dojo in Nerima."<p>At least that part was satisfying. I would get to see Akane again.<p>As I continued methodically punching the posts I increased speed, working towards the level of<br/>conditioning I had before...the end.<p>As I had expected, Cologne came through the brush behind me, flanked by Mousse and Shampoo.<p>"Hello, Cologne." It was satisfying to see the old woman so surprised.<p>"I seem to be at a disadvantage, young woman. Who are you?"<p>"You know. I fell in the Qipannichuan."<p>The old woman nodded sympathetically. "So that explains the dreams. May I enquire as to your<br/>name, and the source of your pain, assuming that deathly scream was you?"<p>"You do the math, crone. I fell into the spring of drowned hope."<p>Cologne looked as if she was ready to hop into a stance, and I realized that I had gone a bit to far.<p>"I apologize, Cologne, but all i wish to do is regain the skills I had before that horrid dream ended<br/>and then go back to Akane."<p>The old woman sighed and nodded, making ready to turn away and go back to her village.<p>I had a sudden flash of insight. "I'd like to make you a deal, Cologne."<p>The old woman turned around, her gaze piercing me.<p>"I want you to train me in the Kachuu Tenchin Amaguriken, the Hiryuu Shoten Ha, and the shark<br/>fist."<p>Very few things could have matched the glee I felt at seeing such surprise on the aged Amazon's<br/>face.<p>To her credit, cologne quickly regained her composure and nodded wisely.<p>"So be it, child. I shall train you provided you can beat Shampoo in single combat."<p>"I don't think so, crone. I don't want the kiss of death again. I'll defeat Mousse." I heard a sound<br/>of facefaulting coming from the bushes.<p>The crone nodded and Mousse, exactly as I remembered him, except perhaps a bit younger,<br/>walked towards me.<p>"Okay, little girl. Get ready to have your rear end handed to you."<p>I grinned at the half-blind ex-duck boy as I poured a convenient kettle of hot water on myself.<br/>"Who said anything about little girls?"<p>* * *<p>The fight was short. It was obvious that Ranma, for I remembered his name from the dream, was<br/>the superior fighter, and though he had lost his body from the dream, he retained his Ki power and<br/>many of his skills by memory. Some of these skills were entirely new to me.<p>"Koutsugou Na Atemi no Pottuhoru!" I was going to enjoy this fight. The boy had just transmitted<br/>his Ki to a large area of ground immediately behind Mousse, using the blind fool as a shield while<br/>bombarding him with rocks, knocking him out in a total fight time of under five seconds.<p>I approached the casually standing Saotome and clamped him on the shoulder. "It will be an honor<br/>to train you, son-in-law."<p>* * *<p>What did she just say!<p>"Just kidding." The old woman flashed a `peace and love' sign.<p>A facefault brought me into unconsciousness.<p>* * *<p>Ranma awoke to my shaking his shoulder gently.<p>"I'm sorry, Ranma. I didn't mean to scare you like that." Did I really do that in his dream?<p>"It's not your fault, Cologne. Let's just say that I didn't ever expect to hear that phrase from you<br/>again."<p>I nodded as if I understood, though I knew that I did not. This child would need some reassurance<br/>to recover from this nightmare he had lived, and I wouldn't be able to help him until I knew what<br/>had happened to him.<p>* * *<p>I sat outside the window of Matsui Yoiko, wondering why her name was so significant to me, and<br/>why I was sitting out her window when I so distinctly remembered being in China at this time.<p>In hindsight, I should have realized that she'd be damn good at the art.<p>I did realize, though, but not until I heard a cry of "Koutsugou Na Atemi no Pottuhoru!" From<br/>under myself and was tossed from the tree I was sitting in as it shattered, and oblivion welcomed<br/>me for what seemed like the tenth time that day.<p>* * *<p>"You'd better have a damn good reason for peeping into my window, whoever you are."<p>I came to find myself strung outside a window, upside down, and staring a beautiful girl, presum-<br/>able Yoiko, who was in little more than an overlarge T-shirt glaring at me.<p>"You're Yoiko Matsui...you were th..."<p>Whack!<p>I went reeling to the ground as she cut me loose, hopped out of the window, and now held a very<br/>sharp dagger at my throat.<p>"Okay, so I have a stalker, I can deal with that." I sighed in relief.<p>"I'm not a st-" She cut me off. Not literally.<p>"I'll just kill you."<p>"What's going on, Yoi-chan?" A sleepy voice penetrated the night like a rather exhausted dagger.<p>"I caught a peeping-tom, Sera-chan. What should I do with him?"<p>The brunette from whom the voice came jumped with sudden glee and began to squeal with<br/>delight. "Let's extract information, Yoi-chan!"<p>"Okay, okay, Sera. Don't wake the neighbors. I'll get the feathers. I hope he's ticklish. This could<br/>be fun!"<p>* * *<p>Two hours later, I was red in the face and short of breath from continuous laughter.<p>"So...you're Hibiki Ryoga." Yoiko, the girl from the dream, grinned at me as if she was about to<br/>eat me. I personally wouldn't mind, so long as she put the damn feather away.<p>Sera, the short gaijin brunette, looked at me with a bit of fear. "He's like the nice girl from the<br/>dream, Yoiko." The poor child looked as if she was about to start crying, she couldn't have been<br/>more than ten years old.<p>In the blink of an eye, Yoiko's knife was at my throat again. "Are you the cause of this, you bas-<br/>tard?"<p>Then I realized what was happening.<p>* * *<p>I gently put my arm across Yoi-chan's to keep her from hurting the boy.<p>"He's had the dreams too, Yoiko." Through some miraculous act of God, I managed to keep my<br/>composure. "He knows why they're happening too, and who's at the center of this."<p>The boy, Ryoga, looked at me as if I had just poleaxed him.<p>Before he passed out again he managed to get out two short syllables.<p>"Ran-ma."<p>***<p>The stage is set for a convergence of forces, as the events of the past are clarified.<p>What happened in the Qipannichuan, what exactly is it?<p>Will Ranma's life really be better than the old one?<p>As this story is complete, that is for another tale,<p>I may revise this chapter later, but as of yet, this story is done.<p>Thanx to Freelance, RedDjango, and Tannimfodder.<p>Special thanx to Figment (Prereader of this entire fic...damn, he's patient.)<p>Very very special thanx to my love, forever, Riyousha.<p>-Inu_Ranma (Inu_)
