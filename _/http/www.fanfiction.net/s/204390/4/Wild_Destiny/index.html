</div> <b>IMPORTANT STUFF:</b> Okie, <i>BSSMoon</i> and <i>Ranma 1/2</i>   was created by Takeuchi Naoko-san and Takahashi Rumiko-san respectively.<p>A <i>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon</i> &amp; <i>Ranma   1/2</i> Crossover<p><b>Wild Destiny</b><p>written by K-chan</p><p><b>Chapter Three: A Friend in Need</b></p>The next morning at the Tendou Dojo, it was the start  of another school day for Akane and Nabiki as they ate breakfast with their  family. Everyone except for the panda had noticed Ranma was not there.   Soun looked at the animal, "Where's Ranma?"<p>The panda stopped eating and took out a wooden sign that read, <i>Don't know</i>  . Nabiki was surprised while Kasumi looked worried and Akane didn't  even care. "You mean, he didn't come home last night?" Nabiki asked.   That caught Akane's attention. Was it her fault he left? He could  have left a message or something. She felt bad that she was to blame  for his departure, but it was better that way. She wondered where he  could have gone to though.<p>Kasumi scooped a bowl of rice for the panda and handed it to him. She  stared at him for a few seconds and then asked, curiously, "Saotome-san,  shouldn't you change back to normal?" Having a cute panda in the house was  nice, but she considered that being human would be more convenient for breakfast.   The creature paused in his meal and flipped his sign to the opposite side,   <i>I am normal</i>. Nabiki smiled musingly, thinking how much money  she could make using Genma as a circus attraction.<p>Not knowing about what happened last night, Soun was about to ask, but  they heard footsteps coming from the hallway. All five heads poked out from  the room and saw Ranma walking up to them. Soun immediately hugged Ranma,  weeping like a baby, "Ranma, you're home at last! Now you can try on this  tuxedo and marry Akane!" The panda snickered while he and Soun displayed  the suit to everyone.<p>"WHAT?" Ranma and Akane shouted. Their fathers were going overboard  if they expected the two to get married immediately. Nabiki was already  making expense notes in the family's financial notebook while Kasumi was  admiring the fine-tailored tuxedo.<p>"I don't wanna marry a pervert like him!" Akane declared. She couldn't  forget what he had done last night. He probably enjoyed being a girl so  he could do whatever he pleased.<p>Ranma yelled back, "Stop calling me that! And you think I want a tomboy  like YOU?"<p>Nabiki calmly broke the two apart, saying, "You two make a fine couple,  but for now we'll be late for school if you don't hurry."<p>"School?" The new subject had caught the pigtailed boy's attention.   He had nothing against school even if he was never a good student, slacking  off, but he always managed to pull through in the end.<p>"Well, we ARE going to be staying awhile," his father said, holding  a kettle of hot water over his head. He handed the empty kettle to Kasumi,  who kindly placed it aside.<p>Done with her breakfast, Nabiki stood up, ready to leave. "It's the  same school Akane and I go to, so we'll see you there." She grabbed her  schoolbag and headed to the foyer.<p>Not wanting to be left behind with Ranma, Akane was forced to quickly  finish her bowl. "Nabiki, wait up!" she called, getting up. "I'll go with  you!"<p>Her sister shouted back, "You're Ranma's fiancee, remember? YOU should  walk him to school!" Akane stopped in the doorway and looked over her shoulder  at Ranma. She had felt guilty when she thought Ranma had left, but now that  he had returned and didn't look like he was going to apologize, she felt  rage surging through her body. Neither said a word but just silently glared  at each other.<p>Akane grumply walked ahead of Ranma, who was quietly strolling on the  high fence. She wouldn't have been stuck with him if her father had not  held onto her leg and embarrassingly cried to her about keeping their family  honor. She of course couldn't say 'no' to him, but she still wasn't going  through with the engagement. Ranma wasn't happy with it either, so maybe  they could strike some deal.<p>Ranma was looking away towards the water below him, recalling what happened  last evening after he recovered from Akane's brutal assault. He didn't know  the girl had it in her, but the family did own a dojo so it was expected.   In the future, he would have to be more careful.<br/>When he left the Tendou's place last night, he thought he would cool  himself down with a walk around the neighborhood, but as thoughts of his  father, his training trip, his wretched curse, and his engagement twirled  in his head, he had lost track of time and place.<p>He eventually came to a main street and immediately recognized it as  the one he had been to before with Usagi. He scratched his head, wondering  how he could've strayed away from Nerima like that. He stood there for a  moment, not sure of what to do, while knowing that Usagi was nearby. "She  sure is nicer than that Akane," he said aloud to no one in particular and  leapt to the rooftops.<p>When Ranma stopped on top of a residential roof, he scanned the area,  hoping he had made it to the right neighborhood. Lights were still on in  a few nearby houses. As he examined each one, he finally spotted flowing,  golden hair and knew it had to be her. He made some final leaps over to  his destination, which was certainly the one since he recalled her house  was the only one with a balcony. He quietly landed on the roof and poked  his head over the side to see what was going on.<p>Usagi was wearing her pink pajamas with white bunnies again. He smirked  at how childish it was, but it really did look cute on her. He was about  to tap on the window when he heard Usagi's mother's voice echoing from behind  the closed bedroom door. He smiled, thinking how that voice could definitely  wake Usagi up. Seeing that she was still awake, all tucked in her bed, he  lightly knocked on the window. He made a puzzled face when she rolled away  from the window and pulled the covers over her shoulders.<p>Ranma was about to try again, but he stopped his hand and drew it back.   Even at the late hour, he wondered if he should be bothering her at all.   She was the only friend he had so far, and being the nice girl she was,  she would forgive him. He hoped so and gently tapped the glass pane again.   This time, she noticed and turned towards his direction. The expression  on her face was priceless, causing him to smile. He realized he was still  hanging upside-down from the roof, so he held onto the edge and swung his  body over the side, landing perfectly on the balcony.<p>Usagi opened the window and asked, "Ranma, what are you doing here?"<p>He rubbed the back of his neck, looking shyly away. How was he going  to phrase the answer? Before he could do any thinking, his mouth opened,  "Umm, Usagi. Can I talk to you?" He looked at her, observing her expressions.<p>She blinked and replied, "Sure." He was surprised at her simple answer  and her gesture as she moved to the side, letting him into her room. "Make  yourself comfy," she said as she closed the window. They sat at the table  that was now closer to her bed than the night Ranko stayed over. Usagi noticed  the troubled face Ranma had and smiled, trying to ease him, "It's such a  coincidence. I was just thinking about you, Ranma."<p>"Huh?" was the idiotic word-if one could call it a word-that left  his mouth. Having her think about him was the last thing on his mind. "Really?"<p>She nodded. "Yeah, like how you were doing, adjusting to the whole  situation and all. I'd go bonkers for sure if that had happened to me."   She paused, looking at him. He smiled nervously. "Is everything okay,  Ranma?" Stupid Usagi, from all his problems, how could everything be okay  for him. Ranma told her about the incidents before he came to see her, which  amused her quite a bit. Usagi was leaning over the table and still giggling  about the bathroom part.<p>"Hey, hey. I was the victim here," Ranma pointed out. He turned away  slightly, offended from her carefree reaction.<p>Usagi calmed down and apologized, "I'm sorry, Ranma, but it really is  funny. I guess you'd just have to be an outsider to see the humor." She  propped her elbows on the table and tucked her hands underneath her chin,  looking adorable. "But you were a girl, so it's okay, right?"<br/>He blinked at her, sensing deja vu. "Man, you sound just like Nabiki."<p>She smiled. "Anyway I think that reaction is pretty normal. I mean,  imagine yourself in her situation. Wouldn't you be upset if a girl who was  really a guy walked in on you?"<p>Ranma held his hands up, admitting defeat. "Okay, you got me there,  but what about the table?"<p>"Akane was wrong there." She tried to picture Ranma getting clobbered  by an airborne table and giggled to herself. Being a martial artist sounded  very interesting. Ranma seemed satisfied that someone was sticking up for  him until Usagi cut him off, "But you also went over the line for insulting  her like that." He slightly slumped over the table, which made Usagi feel  bad for adding those words. She crawled over to the dresser near the head  of her bed and pulled out a box from beneath the clothes. Ranma watched,  wondering what she was doing.<p>She came back to the table with a tin box and opened it with a smile.   "Have some cookies, Ranma." She let him choose from the container, which  he took quite a few-probably even half-and then grabbed two with each of  her hands. "I always have a secret stash for late night emergencies," she  chuckled but then warned him, "But don't tell mom, or else I'll never speak  to you again."<p>He laughed, "Sure, but I gotta have the rest of the evidence." He reached  for a few more as Usagi did the same. Ranma smiled as he reminisced the  fight over the cookies though he ended up eating most of it. Suddenly an  image of Usagi whacking his head appeared in his mind, but somehow he felt  the blow that very moment, forcing him forward. He snapped out of his flashback  and glared at the culprit, "POP! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?"<p>Akane stood a bit behind the duo, fuming with fists clenched tightly  to her schoolbag. She tried to talk to Ranma, but it had been so pointless  the past few minutes. He had appeared to be in another world or something.   Either that or he was doing his best to ignore her, but she didn't like  it when people did that to her. What surprised her more was Genma showing  up to punish his son. If he hadn't, she would have done something herself.<p>"You shouldn't be so insensitive towards your fiancee! She's trying  to get to know you better!" Genma yelled, standing next to Ranma on the fence.   Darkness loomed over Akane when she heard those words. Getting to know  Ranma was the last thing she needed to ruin her life. "Listen, Ranma," the  man continued, "I'll tell you only ONCE-" He was cut off abruptly by Ranma,  who swept his feet towards his father, tripping him into the water below.<p>The panda bobbed to the surface with a fearsome look at the boy. Ranma  grinned, asking, "What's wrong, pop? You were just about to tell me something."   The creature leapt out of the water towards Ranma, who quickly left the  fence and planted his feet on the ground. Akane knew it was going to get  ugly, so she had already stepped away from the two.<p>The panda rushed forward, swinging his paw at Ranma, but the latter  flipped away, successfully avoiding the punch. "Ha! You're getting slow,  old man!" What Ranma should have been worried about was not his father but  the old woman nearby, who had just accidentally splashed water onto him.<p>Akane tiresomely stared at the wet Ranma, thinking he was such an idiot.   "Something wrong, baka?" she inquired, just to muse herself. Of course,  being in the position she was in, Ranko couldn't say anything.<p>"USAGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!" Ikuko's voice rang through the household  and perhaps the neighborhood as well, who would've been used to it by now.   The girl sprang from her comfortable bed, screaming. She was in such a  wonderful dream when she suddenly saw her mother demanding her to get up,  which was what was happening at that moment. "Usagi! Get up or you'll be  late for school again!" Ikuko scolded as she shook her head and left the  room.<p>Ten minutes later, Usagi managed to get downstairs even if tumbling  down was a painful way. She ran into the kitchen and grabbed her schoolbag  and lunch. "EEEK!" she squealed as she realized she only had minutes to  get to school. She quickly kissed her mother good-bye and rushed to get  her shoes.<p>Ikuko was left to sigh after her daughter, "When will she ever learn?"<p>Usagi was trotting down the street, half awake and yawning every forty-seven  seconds. She should be running to school, but she was too tired to do so.   Because of Ranma's little visit last night, she went to bed very late.   Thinking about Ranma, he must've left early that morning since she was lucky  her mother didn't catch him in her room. She did have a nice time with him.   It seemed like every time she was with Ranma, it felt like an exciting adventure.<p>After they finished Usagi's emergency stash of cookies, they were still  hungry-very hungry. Usagi sat upright, leaving Ranma laying on the floor,  "Just watching you eat made me want to pig out more."<p>"You can't blame me. I missed dinner."<p>"I know we still have leftovers since mom made enough for everyone,  including you."<p>"Me?" he questioned, sitting up. "Why'd she do that?"<p>"All right. Not you, but Ranko-chan. She thought Ranko was coming  over again."<p>Ranma smiled, "Well... if I'm gonna eat good food like that, I'll come  over as Ranko every night!" Usagi laughed, standing up. She walked to her  closed door and quietly opened it a bit. Ranma followed her, wondering what  she was planning. She put a finger to her lips, hushing her friend. "It's  a good thing my room's near the stairs. Let's go to the kitchen." He nodded  with eagerness in his eyes.<p>Usagi nodded towards her bright lamp by her bed. Ranma understood and  went to turn it off. Then the two tiptoed out of her room as slowly and  quietly as they could. They were about to pass the bathroom when they heard  the sound of a door opening. The two froze in their places as Usagi glanced  over her shoulder and saw Shingo rubbing his eyes. Usagi immediately pushed  Ranma into the bathroom. She just couldn't have her little brother blackmailing  her.<p>Shingo heard the slam and looked up. "Usagi? What are you doing up?"<p>"Heh heh, I have to use the bathroom." She rubbed the back of her neck,  sweating. "How 'bout you?"<p>"Just getting a drink of water." He started to walk towards the stairs.<p>"Okay." She musingly waved him off. "Well I'll just take my time in  the bathroom." After Shingo disappeared from her sight, she joined Ranma  in the bathroom. "That was so close," she sighed. She saw Ranma leaning  against the sink, breathing heavily. "Ranma?"<p>He looked at her with a frightening expression, "I didn't know girls  could be SO scary. First Akane, and now you." Usagi was confused at what  he said and a little hurt that he'd compare her with Akane. They heard footsteps  walk by and seconds later a door closed. Ranma straightened up and placed  his hands on her shoulders. "Usagi," he began, being very serious. She  wondered what he was going to say with such a grave expression. She felt  like she was in a romantic movie where the couple was at the climax of their  relationship. "Let's hurry and get the food." Usagi facefaulted. "Man,  I'm starvin'."<p>Usagi jumped into the air as she heard the school bell rang. "Omigod,  ? IAmWayPassLateAndHaruna-sensei'llKillMeForSure!"   She eventually made it to Juuban Junior High School, being seven minutes  and twenty-three seconds late to class. She didn't break her earliest record  yet, but on a worser note, she was sent to stand in the halls as usual.<p>"This is all YOUR fault, Ranma!" Akane shouted as the two ran for their  school.<br/>Ranma was a guy again thanks to a little stop at an acquaintance of  Akane's, but after that outburst, there was no way he was thanking her.   He was running on top of a brick wall while Akane's making her way on the  pavement. "You're just blamin' me 'cause I'm a guy!"<p>"So?"<p>"Just what's the deal with that?"<p>Akane didn't answer him yet but kept her concentration ahead of her  as she frowned. Soon the front gates of the school came into view. When  they came nearer to the campus, a horde of male students charged out at them,  shouting, "Akane-kun's here!"<p>Ranma was slightly surprised and wondered if they were the welcoming  party for new students. He noticed Akane getting angrier-even more from  the day before. "I... DESPISE MEEEEEEEEEEEEN!" she screamed as she pushed  forward. She jumped into the air and started to beat every single guy advancing  towards her. Ranma jumped onto the wall and sat there, watching Akane the  boy-beating machine at work. She was like a wild animal on the loose, attacking  every guy she saw, but he still didn't know why she had such a grudge against  the opposite sex.<p>Usagi's angelic voice echoed from last night, "I'm sure Akane's a nice  girl beneath that tough image of hers." They chatted while snacking in the  kithchen. They didn't risk turning on the main lighting in the room so the  refrigerator was opened every now and then. "Besides that, you two have  just met."<p>"Yeah, she wanted to kill me," he said and then continued to munch on  a dumpling.<p>"If you'd just get to know her better." Usagi opened the refrigerator  door to get a drink. She took a can and handed it to Ranma and then got  another for herself. She left the door opened to decide what else was good  to eat while Ranma drank his soda. "I wonder what this is." She lifted  up the tin foil from the plate and made a disgusting face at the food. "Geeze,  who made this?" A sweatdrop grew on her head as she remembered she was the  one who created the dish two days ago. She frowned that no one was nice  enough to eat it.<p>Ranma was thinking about what Usagi had said and admitted she was right.   He glanced over to her, just noticing the light shining on her profile.   "I almost forgot about this," she smiled as she brought out another plate  of goodies and placed it in between them. "I made this today with mom's  help." He watched her unwrap the dish, apparently having forgotten what  they were talking about before. "Well, Ranma," she said, looking up at him  with a warm smile, "give it a try."<p>He suddenly snapped out of his thoughts when he heard Nabiki calling  him, "RANMA! Get in this school now!" He pointed to Akane, opening his  mouth to say something, but she interrupted him, "Don't worry about Akane!   She's used to it!" Ranma looked at Akane, who was finished with the crowd.   He hopped down and joined her as she scanned the area.<p>"Don't tell me there's more in your fanclub," Ranma said, wondering  if she was expecting someone.<p>Akane glared at him. "That's why," she replied, referring to his last  question as to why she hated boys. Ranma blinked at her, having forgotten  his question. The school bell rang, and the two immediately raced to their  first class. As a result of their tardiness to class even if Ranma came  from China, he and Akane stood in the hallway, holding buckets of water.   "This is YOUR fault," she stated.<p>Ranma frowned, "How can everything be MY fault when that was YOUR fight?"   It seemed she was being unreasonable now, he thought.<p>"I always finish MY fights before school starts! If it weren't for  you and your curse, we would've been here on time!" First he didn't even  apologize to her and now he wouldn't even admit his own fault. She really  had to talk to her father about the engagement then. Ranma was not even  close to the man she wanted to marry.<p>"Yeah, just blame it on the curse," he grumbled, turning away. They  were both quiet as he leaned against the window. "Anyway what was that all  about?" he asked, curiously.<p>She sighed, knowing he was going to ask her about the daily ritual.   "Well, it's because of Kunou."<p>"Kunou?" he repeated with a puzzled expression.<p>It was already mid-morning in Tokyo, and Usagi was just on her break  in between her classes. She leaned on her desk, yawning and hoping to catch  some winks before her math class started. "Usagi!" a voice called. She  looked up and saw a girl with short, red hair running up to her. Following  behind the girl was a boy, wearing glasses.<p>Usagi smiled, seeing her friends. "Hi, Naru-chan! Umino."<p>The two stood by the sleepy girl's desk, staring at her. "You look  terrible, Usagi!" Naru exclaimed. "Worse than usual." She tried to prop  the blonde up in her chair, but Usagi just fell forward on top of her desk.<p>"Didn't you get any sleep last night, Usagi-kun?" Umino asked.<p>She yawned and then answered, "Not really." Before the others could  get in another question, there was a loud commotion coming from outside.   Students standing by the windows began conversing among themselves about  the guests at their school. "Hmm?" Usagi sat up, trying to understand the  conversation. "What's this about?" She looked at her two companions. "Did  I miss something?"<p>"You didn't know, Usagi-kun." Umino took out his notepad and started  to tell her, "Today is the kendou demonstration by Furinkan High. They've  been invited to display their talents here today, and the whole school is  going crazy over it." Usagi was amazed. "I heard the captain of the Furinkan's  kendou club is unbeatable!"<p>"Really? Is he cute?" Usagi chirped, looking quite awake now. Naru  joined her, waiting for an answer from him.<p>Umino adjusted his glasses, pouting, as he carefully looked at his notes.   He was about to speak when a student said, loudly, "Isn't that Furinkan's  captain?" That made Usagi and Naru rush to the window. Outside, they saw  a young man surrounded by lots of admiring girls. He was tall and had dark-brown  hair. He wore a dark outfit, carrying a bokken over his shoulder. He seemed  to enjoy the attention on him, which was boosting his ego beyond a normal  person's limit.<p>Usagi and Naru melted at the sight of him, "Aah, he's SO handsome!"   Their eyes glazed over with pink hearts. Umino stood behind them and peered  over, still pouting. He didn't see why they were all making a fuss over  him. The girls absentmindedly grabbed Umino by his shirt, "Umino, What'sHisName?"<p>He quickly looked at his notepad and said, "Uuh, Kunou. Kunou Tatewaki.   Second year-" Tuning the rest of Umino's information out, Usagi gazed  at the handsome captain again. She then made a dash for the exit, hoping  to catch him outside. Naru ran after her, understanding her friend's intent,  and planning to outsmart her by another way.<p>Usagi didn't get too far when she bumped into another student, making  her books fall to the floor. "I'm so sorry!" she apologized and helped the  girl collect the books. She handed them back to her. "I didn't mean to.   I was just in a hurry."<p>The blue-haired girl smiled, faintly, "It's all right." She looked  about Usagi's age, but in her blue eyes, Usagi could see there was great  knowledge. There was more in her eyes than that, Usagi thought. She seemed  lonely. "Is there something wrong?"<p>"Huh? Oh no," Usagi replied, laughing nervously. "I tend to space  out like that. By the way, I'm Tsukino Usagi. I haven't seen you before.   Are you new here?"<p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Tsukino-kun. My name is Mizuno Ami."   She bowed, which caused a surprised Usagi to do the same. "Yes, I just  arrived here today." Things were quiet as the two realized the students  in the hallway were staring at them.<p>Usagi had already forgotten about the reason she ran out of the classroom  but instead wondered why everyone was acting unfriendly. She noticed Ami  looking uncomfortable, pulling the books close to her chest. She didn't  understand what was going on, but it wasn't right to make people feel left  out. Usagi placed a hand on her shoulder, smiling warmly, "Say Ami-chan,  do you want to join me and my friends for lunch?"<p>Ami looked at her, surprised and unsure if she should. This was the  first time anyone has spoken to her and in a friendly manner at that. Something  about Usagi made her relax and feel welcomed. "My friends'll be pleased  to meet you, so don't worry about it," Usagi tried to reassure her. Ami's  eyes softened at the kindness, and she nodded.<p>Usagi trotted out of her last class, looking depressed. She was now  dreading what would happen after school. She just couldn't believe it-actually,  she could believe she failed her math test... again. Her mother would not  be pleased. On her way to lunch, she didn't notice Ami, so the latter called  out to her, "Tsukino-kun!"<p>"Hmm?" She looked up and saw Ami walking towards her and smiled. "Hi,  Ami-chan."<p>Ami had seen the sad expression on her face and asked, "What's wrong,  Tsukino-kun?"<p>"Just call me Usagi." Ami nodded. Usagi took her math test from her  schoolbag and gave it to Ami. "Mom's gonna kill me." With thirty points,  most parents would get upset. "She'll probably ground me for a month without  any allowance or TV or maybe studying all day under her watchful eye." She  groaned, dreading up all the horrible punishments her mother could do.<p>Ami giggled at what she thought were exaggerations. "Usagi-kun, if  you want me to help you study, I would be happy to do it."<p>Usagi's eyes sparkled as she admired Ami. "Really, you'd help me?"   Ami nodded, smiling at a happy Usagi jumping up and down. "I'm saved!"   Her stomach started to growl, and the two of them laughed. "Guess I'm hungry  too." They proceeded outside for lunch when they encountered Kunou and the  Furinkan High Kendou Club. "Kunou-senpai!" Usagi blurted out, waving her  hand at him. Ami watched as Kunou glanced in their direction and then continued  as if nothing happened. The blonde girl looked disappointed, "Maybe he didn't  see me."<p>Ami asked, "Who is he? He looks like a high school student."<p>"Did you hear about the kendou demonstration today?"<p>"Oh, so he's in that."<p>Naru ran up to Usagi, almost out of breath. "Usagi, let's hurry to  the gym!" Usagi was about to ask why, but Naru continued, "Afternoon classes  have been cancelled, so we can see the kendou demonstration!"<p>"REALLY?" She looked over to Ami, "This is great, Ami-chan! Let's  go see it, kay?" Ami nodded, and the three made their way to the gym.<p>That afternoon, Minako was leaning against the wall in the gym, watching  her classmates warm up. She periodically glanced at the entrance as she  waited eagerly to play a game of volleyball, but she was also waiting for  Artemis to show up with some information. She then caught a glimpse of a  white form, but at the same time a classmate called her, "Minako-chan, let's  play!"<p>"Start without me," she shouted back as she headed towards the doors,  "I'll be back soon!" She ran outside after Artemis, who took towards the  bushes by the side of the gym. "Where's Luna?"<p>"She's still back at headquarters." He sat down just as Minako squatted  down next to him.<p>"You know, Artemis," she began, "I find it hard to believe a girl like  that could be an enemy from the Dark Kingdom."<p>He shook his head, "You never know." He looked at her. "There have  been incidents of students becoming sick from attending that new computer  course at the Crystal Seminar building. It's very suspicious, so we'll check  it out after school."<p>"Right, and this Mizuno girl is their best student?" The name sounded  very familiar to her. "Hmm, Mizuno. That's right, Mizuno was top student  in the district!" Minako began daydreaming about being that popular and  famous. Artemis swung his arms in front of her face, trying to snap her  out of it.<p>When school ended, Usagi immediately rushed out and met Ami at the school  gates. She noticed Ami was putting a diskette into her schoolbag as she  came up to her. "After watching Kunou-senpai, I just wanna learn kendou!   Ne, Ami-chan?"<p>She smiled, "Oh, I don't think I could do that. It wouldn't be me."   Usagi nodded, trying to picture Ami dressed as a samurai. She couldn't  even imagine herself as one. Ami figured out what Usagi was doing from the  puzzled face and giggled. She looked at her watch and apologized to Usagi,  "I have a computer class to attend, Usagi-kun."<p>"Computer class? You mean, you've got more schooling to do?" Ami  nodded while sweating. Usagi fell into a thinking pose, "Hmm, with you tutoring,  Ami-chan, then mom'll have to reward me for improving my grades!"<p>Ami laughed, "I'm glad to have met you, Usagi-chan. I mean-" She  realized her mistake and tried to correct, but Usagi stopped her.<p>"Usagi-chan is perfect. Don't be a stranger with me, Ami-chan." She  smiled, "I'll just see ya tomorrow at school then!" She waved Ami farewell  and then headed towards her own destintion. Since her destination at the  moment was home, she slowed her walking pace down. As she walked, she took  out her math test and looked at it. It was horrible. Her mother was going  to punish her for sure. Maybe she shouldn't even go home, but then that  would make them worry, and she'd be in more trouble. She wished the test  would just disappear. With that, she balled it up and threw it over her  shoulder.<p>Unfortunately, the wad of paper struck a young man in the face. "Excuse  me, but do I look like a trashcan?" Usagi turned around just as he straightened  out the piece of paper. She panicked as he read her score aloud, "A thirty?"   She quickly grabbed her test back, fuming at him. "You should really study,  Odango Atama."<p>She stuck her tongue out at him. "That's none of your business!" She  pouted and stomped away, glancing over her shoulder once more to see who  the jerk was. He was tall and had short, black hair. He would've been cute  if he hadn't called her 'Odango Atama.' She wondered why he was wearing  a tuxedo in the middle of the day anyway. Was he going to a party or what?<p>When she thought about it more, the man kind of reminded her of Ranma.   Though Ranma was a bit shorter and had a pigtail too. Too bad the jerk  was wearing sunglasses, so she couldn't really compare their faces. Ranma  had pretty, blue eyes though. She giggled.<p>About twenty minutes later, Usagi arrived at the front door of her house.   She stood there hesitantly, not wanting to enter. She didn't stand there  too long when Shingo strolled up next to her. "Yes, Usagi, this IS our house."   She glared at him as he opened the door and announced that they were home.<p>Ikuko came out from the kitchen, wearing her apron, and welcomed them  home. "Aah, Usagi! I just talked to Umino. He told me you got your tests  back today." Usagi tensed upon hearing that. "He did very well with a 95."   The eager smile on her mother's face didn't help Usagi at all. Shingo stood  by, smiling, knowing very well how his sister did in school. "So how did  you do, Usagi?"<p>"Umm..." How was she going to get out of this one? "I... I have it  right here. Let me get it." She slowly went for the test in her schoolbag  while her mother and Shingo waited impatiently. "Okay." She inhaled deeply  as she hesitated in handing the test over to her mother. "I'mHeadingOverToRanko-chan'sPlaceCauseIPromisedHerIWould,  ButI'llBeHomeSoon! ByeMom!" Usagi was out the door before her mother screamed  her name loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear.<p>Akane sat at her desk, trying to concentrate on her homework, but not  much could be done since Nabiki's presence distracted things. After doing  some leg exercises, Nabiki stood up and walked over to the window near Akane.   "Oh look. Ranma's practicing with his father." Her eyes glanced at Akane,  who ignored her. Nabiki grinned as she opened the window, shouting, "Hello,  Ranma! Keeping fit I see."<p>Ranma looked up, waving at her. "You bet!" He moved aside just as  his father was flying towards him with a kick and landed in the pond. He  turned to the panda getting out of the water. "Guess that's it for the day,  huh pops?" The panda grumbled as he headed into the house for a warm bath.   Ranma looked up at Akane's window again and saw Nabiki was still there.   "Yo, Nabiki!"<p>She turned to him, "What is it, Ranma?"<p>"Could ja tell me what time it is?"<p>"Sure." She picked up Akane's desk clock and then told him, "It's twenty  pass four." She wondered why he had asked. He thanked her and started to  walk around the house to the front yard. She could sense he was up to something.   She noticed Akane had stopped writing but pretending to read her textbook  since she had be looking at the same page for over ten minutes. "Akane,  did you ever find out where he went to last night?"<p>She frowned. "How should I know?"<p>Nabiki smiled, "Ninety-five percent chance he was at a girl's house."   The pencil between Akane's fingers broke in half after she heard that.<p>"Why would I care if he stayed there?" She glared at her sister,  "And just who would this girl be?"<p>"Oh, I didn't think that would get you upset, Akane. After all, you  said you didn't like Ranma." She smirked, "But really though, I was just  taking a wild guess." Akane blinked, not sure of what to say about that.   Nabiki wanted to see what her little sister's reaction to the situation  was, but she had already deduced where Ranma could have gone to. She thought  Ranma might not want everyone to know about it, so she would have to put  that little information in the back of her mind for emergencies only.<p>Nabiki started to leave the room, "Well I'll leave you to do your homework  in peace. Ja."<p>Ranma was in the front yard, sitting down on the steps. He saw Kasumi  coming up from the side of the house, watering the flowers. She spotted  him and smiled, "Hello, Ranma-kun. Are you waiting for someone?"<p>He hesitated to answer. "Umm, yeah."<p>"Oh, it's so wonderful that you've made friends already!" she said,  clasping her hands together joyfully. "I hope you and Akane are getting  along as well. I'm really looking forward to have you as a brother-in-law,  Ranma-kun!" With a kind smile, she continued to water the flowers as she  hummed a little tune. Ranma didn't have the heart to argue with her. Unlike  Akane, Kasumi was a nice, down-to-earth girl. She was a lot like Usagi,  but more mature and way less clumsy, if not at all.<p>Ranma looked up as he heard footsteps running down the street. He saw  a streak of blonde run pass the front gates and knew it had to be Usagi.   Sure enough, the girl came trudging back up to the Tendou Dojo. He walked  up to her with Kasumi following, "Oh my. Usagi-kun, are you all right?"   Ranma chuckled as Usagi waved her hand up to them, trying to catch her breath.   "I'll get you a drink," Kasumi said and left the two.<p>After a few minutes, Usagi stood up and stretched. "Hi, Ranma! How  was your day?" she smiled.<p>He shrugged, "It was pretty normal 'cept for watchin' Akane beat up  the male student body at her school." Usagi blinked. "Yeah, I started school  today. At Furinkan High." That made her blink again.<p>"REALLY?" she yelped, leaning closer to Ranma which surprised him.   Before Usagi could say anything else, Kasumi returned, carrying a tray with  a teapot and some teacups. Not only that, Akane and Nabiki curiously tagged  along. Usagi waved to them, "Hi, everyone!"<br/>Being courteous, Akane smiled, "Hi, Usagi. What brings you to our dojo?"   Nabiki's face seemed to light up, mysteriously, seeing Ranma and Usagi together.<p>"Ranma promised to teach me some martial arts, so I came!" she said,  excitedly. Akane was surprised by her enthusiasm, but why did she choose  Ranma. All the times that she saw him fight, usually with his father, he  didn't seem impressive to her.<p>Kasumi poured tea into a cup and handed it to Usagi, who accepted it  appreciatively. "That's so kind of you, Ranma-kun! Don't you think so,  Akane?" Akane didn't answer as Usagi gave the empty cup back to Kasumi.   "I hope you'll be joining us for dinner, Usagi. It's wonderful to have  guests over."<p>"Oh, I really don't want to bother you," Usagi started, but Kasumi insisted.<p>"Kasumi loves to cook," Akane added with a smile, "I'm sure our father  won't mind either." Usagi could only nod. Kasumi left, leaving the four  to stand around uncomfortably. Akane said to Ranma, "Well if you're gonna  train then shouldn't you head to the training hall?"<br/>"Huh? Oh yeah. Since it was your family's place, I didn't think I  was gonna use it," he said.<p>Before Akane could speak, Nabiki said, holding up her index finger to  them, "A thousand yen for each hour you use the dojo, but since you're just  starting, I'll make it nine hundred." The three were baffled, staring at  her with their jaws practically dropped to the ground.<p>"NABIKI!" Akane shouted, "That's so rude! Not everything has to deal  with money!" She turned to Usagi and apologized, "Please ignore Nabiki,  and feel free to use the dojo, you two." Akane spun around to leave, dragging  her unwilling sister along as well. Ranma was quite shock from Akane's behaviors.   She was actually nice. And when she was nice, she did look likable. Maybe  Usagi was right about her. All he had to do was give her a chance and get  to know her better.<p>Usagi watched them leave. "They are a strange family." She glanced  over at Ranma and noticed him staring after the sisters. She smiled, "So  did you get along with Akane today?"<p>"Uuh..." He turned away and headed to the training hall, "Let's get  started. I don't wanna miss dinner this time." Usagi cheered and then happily  skipped after him.<p>Late that afternoon, Minako and Artemis ran as fast as they could to  the Crystal Seminar building. Unfortunately for her, she had to skip volleyball  practice, but that wasn't a major loss. It would be if they didn't get to  Luna on time. The last time they heard from her was when she had infiltrated  the building, searching for the source of dark power.<p>When the building came into sight, they could see the negative aura  increasing around the area. Minako ducked into an alley with Artemis. She  took out a golden, crescent moon and held it in the air, "MOON POWER! Turn  me into a cute doctor!" She was suddenly engulfed in a bright light. When  the light faded away, Minako appeared in a doctor's uniform with her blonde  hair braided back.<p>"Let's hurry!" Artemis demanded, and the two ran into the building.<p>In the lobby, they saw people sprawled all over the floor. Dark energy  was floating around them. Minako realized she didn't need to disguise herself  after all, but she did look cool. They carefully examined the area but couldn't  find Luna, so they hurried upstairs.<p>In one of the computer classrooms, Ami was sitting in front of her computer,  feeling a slight headache and weak. She couldn't understand why, but she  felt like that ever since she loaded her diskette into the computer. She  tried to stand up and head towards the exit but fell onto the floor instead.   She looked back at her classmates, her eyes blurring a bit, but she could  see everyone in her class had fainted. "Wh-What's going on?" Someone stepped  in front of her, and she looked up. She recognized the woman to be the instructor.   "Sensei, everyone's collapsed! Please call for help!"<p>The woman smiled evilly, displaying her sharp fangs. "You'll join them  soon." Ami gasped as the woman turned into a demon. She tried to get away  before the demon could strike at her. The demon's claws was about to hit  Ami, but Luna jumped for the monster's arm, sinking her feline teeth into  its skin. It screamed in pain as it slammed Luna into the wall.<p>Minako and Artemis appeared at the scene to see Luna trying to get up.   "Minako, transform now!" Artemis commanded.<p>This time, she took out a pen and raised it in the air, shouting, "VENUS  POWER, MAKE UP!" In a shower of golden stars, Minako transformed from her  doctor disguise to the mysterious soldier of love and justice-code name,  Sailor V. She smiled as she finished changing and fell into a dramatic pose.   Her sailor suit was different than before. Instead of the various blue  and red throughout her old outfit, she wore an orange skirt with dark-blue  bows. Her face was decorated with her old mask, which she took off, showing  her sky-blue eyes and the orange gem tiara on her forehead, "I'm back in  town."<p>"Sailor V?" the demon gasped, unbelievingly.<p>"This time, it's Sailor Venus."<p>"I don't care who you are!" the demon bellowed, "But I'll kill YOU!"   A tornado of paper was blown directly at Sailor Venus, who threw her mask  in the path of the attack, slicing up some of the papers. Artemis raced  to Luna to see if she was all right.<p>Luna was able to stand up on her own, "I-I'm fine, Artemis. Don't worry."   They watched Sailor Venus continue dodging the demon's attack as she tried  to close in on it. Ami propped herself up from the floor and saw the fight  between the young girl and monster. She gasped at recognizing the girl as  the famous heroine of Tokyo.<p>"CRECENT BEAM!" the blonde girl shouted. Her golden beam blasted through  the hurling papers, burning them to ashes. Ami saw that there was no way  Sailor Venus could hit her through all her paper attacks. She couldn't get  close to the monster either. There was a chance if the demon was blinded,  but by what? All Ami could do was watch, but in her heart, she wanted to  help. She wanted to destroy the monster who would hurt innocent people.   She wanted to protect them. She closed her eyes, feeling warmth rising  in her body.<p>A blue glow radiated from Ami as Luna and Artemis gasped. They saw  the symbol of the planet Mercury on her forehead. "She's one of them!" Luna  cried. She immediately flipped into the air, summoning a transformation  pen similiar to Sailor Venus's. As the pen landed, Artemis quickly kicked  it towards Ami, who was opening her eyes, confused at the strange, wonderful  feeling. The pen bumped into her, and she picked it up. Luna shouted to  her, "Transform! You have to help Sailor Venus!"<p>Ami was surprised to see the black cat talk, but it wasn't the time  to ask questions. She had to get rid of the demon now. She held the pen  into the air, instinctively, and shouted, "MERCURY POWER, MAKE UP!" The  same feeling returned again, surrounding her body, as she changed into a  sailor suit like Sailor Venus, but everything was blue.<p>When she came out of her transformation, she still felt weak, but what  she was about to do was enough help. She held her hands out in front of  her as the words surfaced from her unconsciousness, "SHABON SPRAY!" From  her hands, a huge wave of ice particles spreaded throughout the room, making  it difficult to see.<p>"Where is she?" the demon said, ceasing her attack from the blanket  of mist. She began to roam the room, swinging her claws around, hoping to  kill her obstacle.<p>Sailor Venus jumped towards the wall to be safe since she couldn't see  the monster either. Then in the distance, she could see two sparkling dots.   "That has to be the demon," she concluded. She raised her hand into the  air, summoning her full power into the final attack. "CRESCENT," her finger  came down, pointing towards the sparkles, "BEAM!" It was too late when the  demon turned towards at the shout. The beam shot through its chest, disintegrating  its body.<p>The mist soon dissipated, and the fainted people were slowly waking  up. They were still alive but very weak due to the energy drainage from  their bodies. Sailor Venus smiled, glancing at the two cats and then at  the new soldier in blue, "Welcome, Sailor Mercury." The blue-haired girl  looked at herself and couldn't believe who she was or what she did. It was  all amazing to her and would probably take some time to get used to. She  looked at Sailor Venus and nodded.<p>Mizuno Ami had accepted her fate as a Sailor Senshi.<p>At the Tendou's place that evening, Usagi was bidding the sisters and  Ranma farewell. She had enjoyed the meal immensely. Kasumi's cooking was  up there with her mother's, if not higher. "Thank you so much for having  me over, everyone!"<p>Kasumi smiled, "It was our pleasure."<p>"Please come by more often, Usagi-chan," Akane added. She was happy  to have known Usagi a little more. The girl was like a little sister she  had always wanted, always cute and cheerful. They got along very well during  Usagi's training, which disappointed Ranma since there was hardly any training  being done when the two girls talked most of the time. Ranma had to face  the situation: he was training Usagi, the girl whose bubbly personality could  brighten anyone's day. What amazed him more was seeing another side to Akane-the  sweet, likable side, which he thought was impossible for her. Usagi really  brought that part of Akane out, he thought.<p>Before Usagi left, Ranma warned her, "Hey, we're definitely training  tomorrow."<p>Usagi sweated, realizing she couldn't avoid all the hard physical work.   "Okay, okay!"<p>"And try not to be late too." She pouted, "That's not a promise  though!" She skipped through the front gates and stopped. She looked back  and smiled, seeing Ranma and Akane standing next to each other. "Be nice,  you two!" They blinked, looking at one another, and then turned their backs  against each other with frowns. Usagi giggled and then headed for home.<p>On her way home, Usagi began to think how lucky Akane was to have a  fiance like Ranma. She wondered when she was going to meet her prince and  live happily ever after with him. She stopped and gazed up at the evening  sky. Some of the stars were beginning to be visible.<p>It was under that same sky hours later that Ranma was punted out the  window from the second floor and into the pond below. Ranko climbed out  of the water, grumbling to herself, "No way is she cute!" She began to wonder  if Akane had personality defects or something. She was all nice when Usagi  was here, but now that their blonde friend was gone, she was mean again.   Maybe she was mean was because of the fact that Ranma had walked in on her  in the bath again but this time he was a guy. That was wrong on his part,  but she wouldn't even let him explain as to why that happened. It really  wasn't his fault-wasn't his fault at all!<p>It was her fault-all HER fault. "NABIKIIIIIIIIIIIIII!" she screamed  into the night.<p><b>TO BE CONTINUED... Next Chapter, "The One He Loves!"</b><br/>
