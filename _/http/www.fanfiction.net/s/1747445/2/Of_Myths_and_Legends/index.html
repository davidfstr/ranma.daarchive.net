</div> <b><p>Of Myths and Legends</p><p>Disclaimer:</p></b> I do not own Ranma1/2 or Street Fighter<b><p>Chapter One</p></b><p>Ryouga walked purposely into Nerima. It had been one year since he last as here, and he has changed greatly. No longer was he the brash depressed youth of the past. He walked confidently, although not with the arrogance of his rival/friend Ranma. He smiled at that revelation. 'That's what he is, my friend. The only real friend I have in this life of mine,' he thought to himself. Reaching the Cat Café he went inside.</p><p>Shampoo and Mousse stared as if they seen a ghost. Ryouga merely nodded and sat down. Coming over to him Shampoo inquired about where he was. "Aiyah, Pig-boy finally come back. Everyone worried about you," she said still surprised.</p><p>"Is that right? Well I took a long time to think about things. Is Ranma still around by any chance? Also do think I can get a Raman?" he asked. Cologne overheard everything and sent a bowl flying toward him, which was caught by Shampoo.</p><p>"This on the house sonny boy, provided you tell me what you have been up too. Mousse bring these to table 2, and Shampoo take over the cooking, Ryouga and I have much to discuss," she said. Ryouga nodded, stood and followed Cologne into the back room having devoured his meal. They sat facing each other. "So Ryouga where have you been, this past year has been dull."</p><p>He grunted and chuckled at that. "Don't you mean, why haven't you been here to sharpen Son-in law's skills? In short I have been training my mind, my soul and my body. I didn't like what I saw in the mirror so I destroyed it, then rebuilt it," he replied. She nodded.</p><p>"Well Son-in law is still at the dojo, as I presume that is where you are heading next. I must warn you, you may not be greeted with joy."</p><p>Ryouga nodded then stood up, "I thank you Honored Elder, I will be on my way." As he went on his way Cologne had the feeling that there lives were about to change drastically. Whether for good or bad, she couldn't say.</p><p>Ryouga breathed in deep as he stood in front of the door of the Tendo Dojo. 'Well here it is. Its time for this all to be out in the open,' he thought. Bracing himself he knocked on the door. Kasumi's face greeted him as the door was opened.</p><p>"Hello-, Oh Ryouga-kun this is a surprise. Come in."</p><p>"Hello Kasumi-San, how are things? Do you know where Ranma is?" he asked nervously.</p><p>"Everything is great. Ranma and Akane are sparring in the dojo," she said. Nodding he walked into the Dojo. Ranma and Akane were indeed sparring. Not Ranma jumping around like a bug avoiding Akane's attacks. They were actually sparring, and Akane looked good. She was at least twice as good than a year ago. 'Hmm, I wonder what happened to make Ranma seriously train her,' he thought. Deciding to make himself known he called out to Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma, I would like to speak with you." They both turned around with looks of shock on their faces. Akane's quickly turned into anger.</p><p>"You Baka pervert! How dare you show your face here Ryouga or should I say P-Chan!" she yelled at him. She ran at him with her Hammer cocked and loaded. Taking a swing at him, she collapsed as a pressure point was hit on neck</p><p>"Boy is she gonna be mad at me when she wakes up, right P-Chan?" Ranma asked with a slight smile on his face. "Let's get out of here" Ryouga nodded and they both went out the dojo and over the wall.</p><p>The two walked for a bit not saying anything. Ranma was a bit confused Ryouga's attitude. There was no attacks, no death threats. Heck when Akane called him P-Chan he didn't even look bothered. Before Ranma could ask him anything, Ryouga spoke. "I challenge you Ranma. This fight is not about Akane or my curse. Nor about bread feuds or duels of honor. This is not about any of that. This is a battle between you and me to see who is the better man." Ryouga's eyes burned with a passion never seen before, and underneath it all was a focus as sharp as a knife. The one thing Ranma knew that if Ryouga ever attained would make him even more dangerous.</p><p>"All right P-Chan, I accept your challenge. It's about time you started like your old self. Where are we gonna have this fight?"</p><p>Ryouga smirked. "Right here of course. The grounds of Furikain High, fitting that we should come full circle." Ranma looked around in shock; Ryouga had led him to the school without Ranma even knowing it. Things were definitely different. Ryouga dropped into a stance while Ranma slipped into his normal relaxed stance. Without warning Ryouga charged at Ranma who easily jumped away. He didn't expect Ryouga to quickly spring to the side and match his speed.</p><p>The two traded punches just like in the old days. The days before everything changed. Ranma had the upper hand, with his greater speed, while Ryouga just shrugged off blows. The two jumped apart and Ranma had a familiar smirk on his face. "Well Ryouga it looks as if you've improved, but not enough." Ryouga only shook his head.</p><p>"Still as arrogant as ever Ranma. But come, show me the power you used to defeat Saffron. I can take it." Ranma dashed toward Ryouga and attacked him fiercely. Blows are countered, techniques are used then altered right on the spot. As the fight continues on each fighter begins to expend ki. 'I'm in shock, I expected Ranma to be stronger than this. Perhaps he needs to face overwhelming power in order to fight at full strength,' Ryouga thought.</p><p>Both fighters jumped away from each other and eyed each other. Both sported cuts and bruises on their face and arms. However, it is evident that Ranma was tiring faster. 'How is Ryouga so fast? He was never this good. I-I guess I've been slacking off,' Ranma thought. Hoping to gain the upper hand he dashed at Ryouga and unleashed his Chestnut fist. "Take this, Chestnut fist revised- Burning fist," he shouted. Hundreds of Ki enhanced fist pounded Ryouga. Not stopping there he charged his left foot with his ki and lashed out landing a solid blow to Ryouga's chest. Ryouga flew backward and landed hard on the ground. Thinking he had the victory Ranma relaxed his muscles and walked toward the fallen fighter.</p><p>Ranma stopped when Ryouga began to get to his feet and started laughing. "Ranma, Ranma, Ranma is that all you have? If it is then you are in big trouble," he said his voice going very cold. Dropping into a fighting stance Ryouga summoned his battle aura. In the Cat café Cologne dropped her cup as she sensed it, while Ranma stared open-mouthed. Not since Saffron had he faced an enemy with that much ki. His time to reflect on that was cut short as Ryouga drove a fist into his gut. Stars danced before his eyes, and blood ran from his mouth as Ryouga's knee connected with it sending him into the air. Finally regaining his senses he used his momentum to land a ki charged foot to Ryouga's jaw.</p><p>Shaking it off Ryouga ran at Ranma attacking him as he landed. Ranma found himself having use more and more power to defend himself. But no matter what he did it was not enough, if was just a mater of time before defeat came. 'Damn it I can't lose to him,' he thought as Ryouga detonated a breaking point underneath him from 5 feet away. Landing on his feet, Ranma gathered his ki in his hands. He ran at Ryouga, then jumped straight into the air and fired his attack. "Dragon's Fist!" he yelled. A reddish wave of power shot from his hands with incredible speed. Ryouga made no move to dodge; instead he started glowing blue and put his hands in front of him.</p><p>Amazingly he caught the blast and threw it back with all his strength, forcing Ranma to dodge in mid air. He followed up by attacking Ranma as soon as he landed. Ryouga simply destroyed Ranma's guard. He flowed though his counters like water. All throughout this Ranma could do nothing. He could do nothing as Ryouga simply took him apart. 'He is playing with me,' he realized as Ryouga hit him in the back. Standing up he yelled to the heavens "NO ONE PLAYS WITH RANMA SAOTOME!" Reaching deep within himself he found what he needed. The Phoenix Killer had finally awaked.</p><p>"Well its about time. I was starting to get bored. Well it looks as though we have company," Ryouga said. The two were so wrapped up in their battle they failed to realize the Tendos, the Amazons as well as half of Nerima arrived. The two faced each other, their battle auras swelling.</p><p>"You have improved so much Ryouga, but you will not defeat me," Ranma said ignoring the questions thrown at him. The two simply looked at each, as if seeing each for the first time. Then on an unspoken signal launched at each other. They fought at blinding speeds, so fast that even Cologne and Happy had trouble following.</p><p>Rolling on the floor Ryouga slammed his hand on the ground. Almost instantly jagged spikes rose from the ground nearly striking Ranma. Using this distraction, Ryouga sprang and delivered a shot to Ranma's shoulder. The pig-tailed fighter screamed in agony as the strike hit a nerve cluster. He was then kicked harshly in the chest, sending him skidding along the ground.</p><p>In true Saotome fashion Ranma improvised. He grabbed one of the spikes in the ground with his uninjured hand, and swung around flying into Ryouga foot first. Or that was the plan. Sidestepping, Ryouga brought his fist down onto Ranma's face knocking him out. A gasp went up as Ranma lay there unmoving. In took a few seconds for everyone's brains to register the fact that Ranma had lost. Ryouga had defeated Ranma, in a straight fight.</p><p>Before anyone could say a word, Ryouga picked Ranma up and bounded off in the direction of Doctor Tofu leaving everyone in a state on confusion. 'I have finally done it. Even though you have become stronger than you were that fateful day, I have still defeated you. For now I am the best. I welcome the day when you seek to get back that title,' he thought. Bracing himself he walked in to Doctor Tofu's office…</p><p>In a cave a man turned demon sat deep in meditation. It had been years since he last had moved. Ever since his defeat at the hands of Ryu, he became a shell of his former self. Once he was feared, now he was forgotten. However, soon that wouldn't be the case. Old pieces were moving; new blood was being prepared. For years he had been gathering his power. Soon he will have his vengeance. Soon the world will know his name. Akuma will be feared by all.</p><p>"Come on Ken, keep up," a voice teasingly said. A middle-aged man, with brown hair wearing a white gi was jogging through the woods. Moments later an another person with long blonde hair and a red gi caught up to him</p><p>"What ever Ryu. Why are we training so hard again? I mean, I thought you gave up the whole fighter bit, after you defeated Akuma and mastered your abilities. And you know that after I mastered my abilities I only train to keep sharp. So what gives?" Ken asked. Ryu was thoughtful for a moment. Then he answered.</p><p>"I have a feeling we will be needed. In what way, I do not know. However we will definitely be needed at the best of our ability." Both men went silent and resumed their training. Each other lost in thoughts of the future.</p><p>A/n: Well that is chapter one. I won't be able to update as much as I will like. However, the more reviews I get the faster chapters get done. So please do me a favor if you like it drop me a line. Even if you don't, tell me what needs to be done. Until next time, R&amp;R.</p>
