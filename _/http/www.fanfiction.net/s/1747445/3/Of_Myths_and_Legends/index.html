</div> <b><p>Of Myths and Legends</p><p>Disclaimer: </p></b>I do not own Ranma1/2 or Street Fighter<b><p>Chapter 2</p></b><p>Dark clouds are said to be omens of misfortune. Perhaps that explains why a woman named Rose looked on this cloudy summer day with dread. A feeling of impending doom filled her heart and soul. 'I have not felt this way since, Bison was alive. But this is different somehow. I must find out what is going to happen,' she thought. Her choice made, she slipped into the game of fate.</p><p>Cologne was still in shock. Her son-in law was just defeated, fairly, by his chief rival. 'I knew that boy had improved, but that much in such short time is unprecedented. I will have to keep an eye on that boy in the future,' she thought to her self. All around her things were shifting. Being alive for hundreds of years did wonders for her sensitivity. Now she could definitely sense a shift in the forces of the world. However she didn't know what exactly was happening. That worried her greatly.</p><p>Meanwhile Shampoo was in a sort of a funk. Her normally bubbly personality has taken a dip. "Stupid lost boy. I bet he used some magic to defeat Airen. No one can beat Ranma, not even phoenix king," she mumbled to her self as she worked. If only she knew how wrong that statement was.</p><p>Ranma sat across from Ryouga in the dojo. The two sat unmoving for a long while. Using this time, Ranma gathered his thoughts and questions.</p><p>"So Ryouga, I guess I gotta say it. You sure have improved a lot. How did you do it?" he asked. Ryouga merely grinned.</p><p>"Simple, by seeing hell." Ranma blinked at that. "After Phoenix Mountain, I realized I wasn't in the same league as you anymore," he said with a hint of hurt. "So, I promptly got lost. I wandered around for about a week or so, then I stumbled on an old dojo. The caretakers took me in, where they trained my body and soul. I learned to control my anger and depression as well directional sense. They taught me many things, but it was brutal. I wouldn't wish that on anyone."</p><p>Ranma was thoughtful for a moment. 'While he was out doing God knows what I was sitting here not being challenged. Sure the old ghoul and the pervert taught me some nice new tricks, but there was no competition. Not to mention my new relationship with Akane,' he thought.</p><p>"I don't know what to say Ryouga. Except that I will defeat you. Ranma Satomone never loses…for long," he stated. Ryouga just smiled and nodded. Just then they heard Kasumi's voice ring out signaling dinner. Ryouga stood up but Ranma remained sitting. "Tell everyone I won't be eating tonight. I have to practice."<br/>With that he stood up and started to stretch. Ryouga stood for a few moments before going to eat dinner.</p><p>As he warmed up, Ranma thought. He thought about everything leading up to this moment. 'I can't believe the lost boy beat <i>me</i>.Me, the killer of a god, a man raised to be the best. I suppose it was to be expected, with the past year being so dull. With no challenges I could finally focus on other things. Like me and Akane. Even though we aren't there yet, there is a definite possibility. We really have become closer, ever since I started training her,' he thought. Stopping his motion, he searched his soul for his ki, once he found it he began practice with intensity long forgotten.</p><p>'But that is no excuse for losing. Even though pops is no match anymore, even though no one has been a challenge since Saffron, I still shoulda trained as hard as before. Make no mistake Ryouga I will defeat you,' he thought as he ran through kata after kata.</p><p>Unbeknownst to everyone forces were moving, shifting all around the world. The martial arts masters were become restless. One such individual sighed as he felt his time was near. "You can come out, I know you are there," he said to a seemingly empty forest. A grunt signaled that his message had been heard. A man in a black gi, and red eyes stepped out from behind a tree. His aura was massive.</p><p>"Happossi, your time is at an end." The old man merely sucked on his pipe. Both fighters went into there respective stances. The old man's eyes were as sharp as knives. Gone was his playful smirk when bothering Ranma and co. He aura and demeanor marked him as a master. Playtime was over. His opponent was out for blood, and Happossi wasn't about give him any.</p><p>"Bring it on sonny boy. If you think you can handle it." The man stomped his feet on the earth, his aura blazing in reply. Like a shot the two were off, locked in deadly combat. The man attacked the old master head on with a flurry of punches and kicks. Happossi, using his small size dodged around them searching for his opening. Using a tree as a springboard he launched him self at the man, striking him in the chest with both feet. Not stopping there, he followed up with a right hand to the stomach, which was blocked and countered with a knee to the face.</p><p>Stumbling back Happi attempted a leg sweep, which was avoided, giving him enough time to get his bearings. However his opponent had other plans as he sent a ki blast toward the old man forcing him to duck. Feeling a chill down his spine, he rolled out the way of an axe kick from behind. 'Hmm, so he can teleport or something. No matter,' he thought.</p><p>Going on the offensive, he threw his trademark bomb at his enemy and followed up with a series of hand thrusts. The man didn't even break a sweat in avoiding the bomb and parrying the strikes. The forest was beginning to feel the effects of the battle, as many trees were broken and battered. The old pervert was caught by a rising uppercut that knocked the wind and sent him toward a tree. Recovering he grabbed onto a branch and used the momentum to come back twice as fast. He wasn't expecting the man to rise into the air with a spinning kick, catching him full in the face three times.</p><p>Crashing into the floor, with blood pouring from his mouth Happossi knew he was in trouble. Looking up he saw his opponent sliding toward. He knew he should move, but he was paralyzed with fear. When he looked into the man's eyes, he saw death. In an instant he was upon Happossi. A bright light flashed, and his scream echoed for miles. When it died down the man stood over the broken body of Happossi, the symbol for evil flashed briefly on the back of his gi. He uttered one word, "Worthless," then vanished.</p><p>Meanwhile the old man lay on the floor dying. His last thoughts were, 'Take care of them granny.' Then he gave up the ghost. Happossi was no more.</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>In the Cat café, Cologne stopped working. Shaking her head she whispered, "Oh Happi, what will happen?" With that she delegated the work Shampoo and Mousse and went into her room.</p><p>"But sir, with all do respect Shadaloo is still out there. We need-,"</p><p>"Ms. Li, we have been over this there have been no new instances of the Shadaloo organization. As such, I cannot allow or give my permission to pursue this endeavor. Officially that is, why don't you and Col. Guile take a vacation, perhaps to Japan," the man said with a grin. "We have had reports that Vega is conducting business there…" he let his statement drift off.</p><p>Chun Li nodded at that. Bidding her commanding officer farewell and thanks, she went off to find Guile. They would finally put an end to Shadaloo. They were not prepared for what would await them.</p><p>Sitting in his office Sagat sighed. This were boring now. Over the years he had a change of heart, and tried to steer clear of the law. When his boss Bison died at the hands of Ryu, it forced him to wake up and realize this life would get him nowhere. Of course he still burned with the passion to defeat Ryu, but he was no longer blinded by it. Be that as it may, he was still bored. Running a company still did not give him the thrill he once had as the right hand man of Bison. Which is exactly why he needed to do something else. With that in his mind he cancelled all his appointment for a month and caught the next plane from Thailand to Japan. He was going to pay a visit to an old friend.</p><p>Well that's it for this chapter. Sorry for the long delay, my Internet went down, and then my CPU crashed so I had to rewrite this from scratch. Please don't hold it against me. Updates will come more frequently, providing I get responses. Oh I have changed my mind about ending my other story. Be on the look out real soon for an another chapter. Until then read, enjoy and review.</p>
