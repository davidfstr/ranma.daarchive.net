</div>Good to be back, I would have uploaded faster, however, I was kicked off this site for two weeks. Apparently I made an 'inapropriate racial slur' towards hooker killing. I apoligise to all fanfic reading hookers, and whoever reported me.<p>Two Week's after  Nodoka arrived</p><p>The mood around the  Tendo house had taken a turn from dark to black hole. Ryoga had left  and stopped showing up for the two week's after Ranma/Ranko's  'returning home'. Akane and Kasumi had been spending time with  the girl as much as possible, which had been the times Genma and Soun  had come together too plan… something. Nodoka had grudgingly  brought Genma into her house after she figured that Ranko would  require some kind of father figure in her life. Soun and Genma were  currently pounding out the details of their master plan in the other  room as Nodoka asked Kasumi some advice.</p><p>"She's been so  depressed and angry lately" Nodoka relaxed as her little girl ran  and played with Akane, "And when she has so much ki powering her  temper tantrums, well, I don't try to get her angry too often."</p><p>"Too be fair, you  may have over-reacted about what happened" Kasumi poured her guest  a cup of tea as she continued speaking, "Ranma is still alive in  her, all we need is another mushroom too restore Ranma's right  age."</p><p>"And the memories?"</p><p>"…" Kasumi  failed for words at the thought</p><p>"So instead I'd  have a sixteen year old who still thinks she's four, and still a  girl… big improvement."</p><p>"At least we're  trying to get him back."</p><p>"By sitting here  playing games!" Kasumi was taken back by Nodoka's outburst, "I  can't find them because I can't abandon my child again!"</p><p>Kasumi slumped down  thinking of a response as a buzzer sounded out from the house. Kasumi  and Ranko both perked from a conditioned response.</p><p>"Ranma-chan,  medicine time!" Ranko had tried to make a break around to the  fence, but got side tracked by the directional malfunction and ended  running straight into Kasumi's legs, "Didn't even have to chase  you this time."</p><p>Ranko continued to  complain as Kasumi plucked the refilled medicine bottle off the  counter and popped a pill into her hand.</p><p>"I still don't  understand why you hate taking these." Kasumi frowned as the little  girl twisted her head too the side to avoid taking the medicine, "The  doctors gave it a cherry coating for the aftertaste. You should want  to have one!"</p><p>"Nuh-uh!" The  small red-head gave an over exaggerated head shake, "It taste's  like chalk and it- it's not good or cherry."</p><p>Kasumi's brow  furrowed at the thought, she was certain the pills she had seen the  doctor give were the same as the first ones. Cautiously she snapped  the pill in half and tasted the unflavored center. It did taste  horrible, but a strong bitter resin was left, not a chalk taste.  Kasumi ignored the girl trying to get back outside and walked over to  the medicine cabinet where Ranko's last pill container still had a  single small pill left at the bottom. Again she snapped the pill and  tasted the center, again a strong taste, but one that left a dry,  chalky feeling at the back of the throat.</p><p>"Oh my." Kasumi's  slight nurse training took over as she stepped to the phone to  immediately call Dr. Tofu, "Tofu-sensei, this is Kasumi. I'm  bringing something for you to look- are you dancing? Stop throwing  things and listen for a second! Dr. Tofu? Dr. Tofu!"</p><p>Kasumi hung up the  phone in defeat and glared at the two snapped pills in her hand.  Hurriedly she stepped towards the back patio, passing Ranko and  warning her that they were not done yet as she stepped through the  door towards her sister and Nodoka.</p><p>"Akane, I need you  in here for a second."</p><p>"Okay, Kasumi."  Akane smiled with sad eyes, "Having troubles with Ranma-chan?"</p><p>"More or less."</p><p>Akane excused herself  for leaving the conversation halfway through and stepped into the  kitchen. Kasumi opened both of her hands revealing two broken pills,  one on either palm.</p><p>"Try one of each."</p><p>Akane blinked and  raised one eyebrow, "Have you been watching the Matrix?"</p><p>"This isn't a joke  Akane," Kasumi stared with an intensity that rivaled Happosai  staring at a bra, "Taste one than the other."</p><p>Akane's hand reached  out slowly and took one of each half pill. Gingerly she put her  tongue to each one and furrowed her brow.</p><p>"They're different  medicines." She muttered shocked, "Did the doctors mess up the  first time?"</p><p>"I don't know, but  I would think not. When I saw Dr. Boyle fill the container I  memorized the name in case Dr. Tofu needed it. Ranma-Chan's new  medicine was filled with the same thing."</p><p>"Maybe somebody made  a mistake or maybe they came out with a stronger type."</p><p>"I'm not leaving  Ranma's health in danger. Take these pills down to Dr. Tofu and see  if he can test them, to find out what they are."</p><p>"Dr. Tofu's? Why  don't you want to go?"</p><p>"I have to stay with  the company and make lunch… And I certain that Dr. tofu would end  up destroying everything if I showed up there."</p><p>"I see, I'll be  glad to take it there for you, take care of Ranma while I'm gone."</p><p>Akane pocketed the  pills and glanced over at the little red-head as she stared glumly at  the pill she was forced to take. Akane smiled slightly at the  misplaced depression and started out to the good doctor's office.</p><p>Away from this little  scene, in the next room over, Soun and Genma 'planned' the future  of their school… This mainly consisting of seeing who could stand  on one leg the longest while drinking sake. Genma toppled over  chuckling at his old friend, who was currently shit-faced and  toppling off on one leg.</p><p>"You seem more  cheerful today, Tendo." Chuckled out a drunken Genma, "Any reason  why you're not flooding this place with tears?"</p><p>"Well." Soun  toppled over on his side after taking another shot of sake, "Let's  say my troubles and worries are coming to a close Saotome. A new  lease on life!"</p><p>"Getting ready for  your child's marriage, eh?"</p><p>"Something like  that."</p><p>"What's that  supposed to mean?"</p><p>"Nothing, I've  found a great way to protect the school."</p><p>Genma was curious now,  "Oh? And how's that Tendo?"</p><p>Soun instinctively  flashed his eyes at his breast pocket then back to meet with Genma,  "We… unify our schools through marriage!"</p><p>"That's always  been our plan. What did you stash in your pocket, Soun?" Genma  ignored the man's protests and quickly tore out the note from his  pocket with little struggle, "'the Tendo- Saotome School  Unification Contract… I remember this; our wives made us sign it  before we agreed on the arranged marriage. Hmm? What's this? 'The  Generation Clause': In the case that the couple is not married upon  the age of 17 or the wife to be of the Saotome or Tendo clan's is  impregnated by another man. Then the marriage is deemed no longer in  the hands of the parents and the Arrangement destroyed! What is  this!"</p><p>"A failsafe Saotome,  our wives felt that if the children were not in love enough to openly  express that the wished to be married before 17, or that they loved  another, that it would be cruel and unusual to make them marry after  they reach adulthood."</p><p>Genma fumed in rage  before he composed himself. He couldn't go against something his  wife had made so specifically against this if he still wanted to  raise Ranma to be a great martial artist, "I guess it can't be  helped. If I have to admit defeat because of my own wife, then so be  it."</p><p>"I'm glad you're  looking at this rationally, I wouldn't want my daughter to marry  someone she hated."</p><p>"On the other hand,  if they marry before one of them turns 17, then the schools can still  be joined and our livelihood can continue. Hmm… I prefer the  latter."</p><p>Soun's jaw  dropped, "You're insane!"</p><p>"NO! I wasted many  years of my life on this and I refuse to watch everything I have  worked so hard for disappear!"</p><p>"These are our  children Saotome! Think of their future!"</p><p>"Think of our  future! Do you want the Anything Goes School do slip into the history  books as a long forgotten clan of losers! Or do you want to rise up  to the challenge and push our school into greatness!"</p><p>Soun composed himself  and sat up on his knee's, head tilted down, "There is nothing I  would like more than to see my school become the greatest it could  be. I also agree that Ryoga could make a good replacement for Ranma  under the circumstances. But I still refuse to sacrifice my daughter  to your mad desire!"</p><p>"I see." Genma  placed his hand on Soun's shoulder in an understanding pose, "I  am so sorry it had to come to this… old friend."</p><p>Genma's hand seized  on the cardiac control nerve on the side of Soun's neck.  Immediately his hand had risen to pry the arm off, nails biting into  skin as Soun felt his pulse slow and blood drain from his head. His  body fell to the left as his vision dimmed, but he could just barely  make out Genma's final thought.</p><p>"Old friend, when  you wake up, I promise that everything will be set straight."</p><p>Genma brushed off his  gi and got in the right frame of mind before bursting out yelling  "Kasumi! Come quick! Soun needs help!" At the thought of her  injured father the mother figure of the Tendo clan quickly fell to  her father's side and examined his swelling throat.</p><p>"I would think that  we happened across a bad bottle of sake. I wouldn't worry too much.  This happens to happosai all the time. Just put him to bed for the  next week or so.", Kasumi nodded politely and hefted her  unconscious father over her shoulder and out the door as Genma added,  "Oh, and tell Ryoga and Akane I want to talk about their future."</p><p>Shampoo covered her  face with a large section of cloth as she stirred her vile  concoction. A smooth yellow broth that smelled of chicken, garnished  with deectible noodles… yes, chicken soup… But EVIL CHICKEN SOUP!  For this soup contained a secret Amazon interrogation material.</p><p>"What are you up too  now Shampoo?" A cracked, ancient voice rang out from behind her,  "We follow Ranma and Ryoga's tracks for weeks only too turn  ourselves back around towards Tokyo. And now you've taken to  cooking obscenely large… sniff wait… is that?"</p><p>"Yes great  Grandmother." Shampoo purred as she spooned a massive ladle of  noodle's into a sealable container, "Secret Amazon inhibition  releaser."</p><p>The Grand matriarch of  the Chinese Amazon's stared at her heir curiously, "Planning on  getting somebody drunk?"</p><p>"Not quite  Grandmother." Shampoo slipped the drugged food into her food case  and lifted the tent flap, "Shampoo think that pig boy and violent  girl know more then them telling."</p><p>Cologne chuckled  lightly as she watched her granddaughter leave, "I simply must tell  her not to speak in third person singular anymore… once I get tried  laughing…"</p><p>Shampoo got a half  click down to Tokyo before her path transformed from rough strewn  trees to clear-cut stumps. The bushes and grass had been burned in a  continuous line and fragments of metal and wood littered the ground.  Her train of thought was interrupted by the numerous chains and ropes  wrapping around her delivery box and pulling it away.</p><p>"Shampoo! You knew  exactly what to bring to me." Mousse stood on one of the few  remaining tree's and recoiled the box into his grasp, he proceeded  to ignore shampoo's half threats and warning's and consume the  content's of shampoo's drugged box, "Delicious like always, how  goes the fruitless search?"</p><p>"What that mean?"</p><p>"Did I say  fruitless? I meant useless, no! What? Have you found the kid yet? I  mean Ranma!" Mousse's face went red as he stumbled in his steps  and fell off the tree, "I feel sick."</p><p>Shampoo sultrily made  her way over to Mousse's drunken figure, "Shampoo want to ask  Mousse questions. You will answer, yes?"</p><p>Akane returned from  Dr. Tofu's with the classic anime 'I'm hooommme'. After  discarding her shoes she wandered around looking for anyone left  back.</p><p>"Kasumi? Nodoka? Dr.  Tofu says the analyses of the medication will take at least till the  end of the week to be ready and… what's going on?"</p><p>Genma and Ryoga stood  next to the table, reading over the final attachments on a contract  that seemed to be exceedingly important to the two men.</p><p>"Ahh, Akane's  finally here." Genma wore a large smiled and trust a pen into her  hand and pushed it to the contract, "Sign here."</p><p>Akane pulled her hand  away, "What is it? And where is everyone?"</p><p>"Just a little  something necessary for our schools union." Genma still smiled wide  and pushed her hand down to the paper, "Your father and I agreed  that you two should wed as soon as possible, we have it set for the  end of this week."</p><p>"This week! Are you  insane?"</p><p>"No! I merely have  the schools best interests in mind, and besides, our roles in the  arranged marriage allows me and Soun to push you two together without  this marriage license, (remember the final book/ final chapter?) it's  just easier if we all go along with it."</p><p>"Akane, please."  Ryoga bowed on his knee's and prayed at her feet, "If I am to  marry you, I don't want to see hatred in your eyes as it happens.  Let it be sadness, love, greed, I would take anything but seeing your  beautiful eyes tainted by your hate for me. I've already willingly  signed my end of the contract Akane."</p><p>"I can't. I-I just  can't." Akane stumbled back, flushed at what happened, "Ranma…  I still- he still."</p><p>"Ranma can move in  with us Akane! I would gladly bring her with us to help with her  sense of direction."</p><p>Akane held her hand to  her head and dropped her hand to the pen. Genma smiled slyly and  pushed it too the dotted line. He and Ryoga watched greedily as the  confused girl half-wittingly signed her name.</p><p>AT THE WEDDING!</p><p>The Tendo's had   managed to rent a chapel for this occasion and as such, had gathered  a large group of people, mainly from the Tendo friends and family, to  witness. Soun had woken up from his coma and was in a wheelchair to  witness his little girls marriage, he had not been paralyzed, but an  excess of spinal fluid and swelling had prevented him from moving  temporarily and prevented him from talking.</p><p>Akane and her  bridesmaid's were getting ready for the biggest night of her life.  All except for the bride to be were laughing and giggling at their  places in the wedding. The chuckling and laughing was disturbed,  however, When Kasumi roughly threw open the door and quickly made her  way past the partiers to Akane.</p><p>"Akane, this may not  be the best time, however, it could b the only time." Kasumi had a  look of desperate concern on her face as she thrust a folder of  papers into Akane's waiting hands, "We finally got the test  results from Dr. Tofu's examinations. The first pills we got for  Ranma-chan were placebos, sugar pills."</p><p>"The doctor's gave  Ranma sugar pills!"</p><p>"Akane, I'm afraid  it may be worse than a mix up. Think back, since Ranma has been  taking the sugar pills the only one who has gotten any effect has  been, well, your fiancée, Ryoga."</p><p>"Stop right there!"   Akane's shout tore the room into silence, "Ryoga may not be the  best guy for me, but he would never, no one would ever, steal  medication from a little girl. No one would make someone suffer like  that on purpose!"</p><p>"I know how this  must feel Akane. But think back to Ryoga. Can you say for sure that  everything you've just said is true?"</p><p>"…"  Akane didn't have time to think as Organ music to 'here comes the  bribe' began playing. Genma pushed open the door, followed by a  little red haired girl carrying a basket of flowers. Genma hooked his  arm as he and Akane strolled out onto the aisle towards the waiting  husband. They reached each other as the music ended and the minister  rattled off the marriage ceremony, pausing at only one point.</p><p>"If  anyone here has any reason as to why these two should not be wed  speak now or forever hold your peace.</p><p>"I  may have something. Ryoga…" Akane raised her hand into the air,  "Ryoga, d-did you take Ranma-chan's medicine!"</p><p>"Of  course not!" Ryoga's body felt weak as he stabilized himself on a  nearby church railing, "I love Ranko like a sister why would I?"</p><p>"What  about your sense of this direction. Did you take them?"</p><p>Ryoga  had been found out. Sweat poured across his face as he searched for  an answer and his face turned red. He spoke again, "I work hard to  fix my problem and this is my repayment!"</p><p>"Tell  me straight! Were you evil enough to wreck Ranma's life?"</p><p>"WHAT  IF I WAS!" Ryoga screamed out at the top of his lungs, his face  beet red, "What if, perchance I was human enough to see something  that has been plaguing me for years, so, in a moment of weakness,  stole them from someone who doesn't deserve them, of course I took  them you idiot! And, you know what? I don't care. I used to, but  that feelings gone. Ranma had everything: 4 fiancée's to  choose from, a family he doesn't have to write a flaming message in  the sky to get them to meet somewhere, strength, a curse that not  only keep's him human, but also lets him fool people LIKE ME! Now  he has a chance to know what I feel everyday, the misery that I did  not deserve!"</p><p>Tear's  welled up in Akane's eyes at the tirade and her head dropped down  to look at the floor "You monster." Without even picking her head  from the floor her hand snapped like a whip, catching him across the  face with soba speed and power, knocking him into, and destroying,  three empty church pews. Her fists clenched with tears running down  her face she turned, and ran out.</p><p>"Come  back!" Ryoga was no longer holding anything back, his depression  and anger aura singed wood and skin as he charged out onto the street  after her, "You can't run! We were made to be together! Come back  and love me!"</p><p>Unbeknownst  to Ryoga, a fantastic change was happening in his mind. You see,  medication is required everyday for it to work properly; not taking  said medication in days or in Ryoga's case an entire week would  cause the condition to either worsen or stop repairs on it. Ryoga's  mind was aflame as the hippocampi (ridges in the brain that dictate  thought and direction) began their slow deterioration, while he ran  deeper into the forest.</p><p>LATER THAT NIGHT</p><p>Following the failed  wedding, all able bodied martial artist searched for Akane while the  rest, say, Kasumi, Nabiki, Soun, and Ranko went home. Ranko had been  tucked in by Kasumi, but couldn't sleep. Her room seemed empty  without her father's latent form, or his snores echoing. She sighed  and resigned to looking out the window. Ranko had been slowly  drifting off as she was startled awake by a figure at her window. A  shadowy hand unlatched the lock and opened wide her entrance into the  darkened room.</p><p>"You…" Ranko  muttered before something was shoved deep into her mouth as she was  picked up and taken away.</p>
