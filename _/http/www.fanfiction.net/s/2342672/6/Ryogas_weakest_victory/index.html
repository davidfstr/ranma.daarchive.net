</div><p>OKAY, heres another short chapter, well shorter than I could have made it, but the reason I left it this short is because, I really don't know where the stories going from here. SO IM GIVING A CHANCE FOR A CONTEST! I will pick three of my lateset reviewers and give them several seperate endings to choose from, then will alter the story based on their reactions to each. okay? Good. BTWanybody who has a music downloading program should look up the series 'NARUTO', it is damn good and the best Anime since Ranma 1/2</p><p>The phone rang again at the Tendo household and was answered by Soun. He returned speech into the receiver with a distressed tone from what all around could hear. Genma inquired into what was wrong.</p><p>"We've been hired to exterminate a demon, Saotome." Answered Soun, threatening to release the waterworks that burst forth every 5 minutes, "What should we do?"</p><p>"Do? We go as a martial arts family and kick that demons scaly ass!"</p><p>"Ohh, and who would go with us?"</p><p>"Me, you, Akane, Ran..ma…" Genma trailed off.</p><p>"Oh, you mean that Ranma?" he jerked his tumb towards the small girl who was giggling and kicking her legs as Kasumi tried to get her to take a nap by tickling her into exhaustion, "Saotome, I'm sorry but I believe that it's time to discuss your, uhh, moving out of my house."</p><p>"What? The future of the anything goes school of martial arts depends on me and Ranma and the joining of our schools!"</p><p>"I'm sorry Genma, Ranma is both too young and of the wrong gender. You're taking up our spare money to feed yourselves and you don't do any work. Without the ability to give an heir to the school, you can't stay here."</p><p>Genma held his hand to his head and looked out the window. Akane and Ryoga ate outside and took turns feeding each other fruits. Genma lit up and spoke to Soun, "Since Ranma can no longer continue as heir to the school, maybe it's time to find another who can…"</p><p>2 WEEKS LATER</p><p>Ryoga and Akane had publicly announced their love, kissing every time they met and making out in their houses and cars. Ranko had progressed through 7 types of being lost and was currently settled on a type of dyslexia that affected the ability to distinguish left from right.</p><p>Akane led Ranko to the backyard of Ryoga's house and into a series of sliding panels.</p><p>"Now, Ranko" directed Ryoga, "Each panel has an arrow that is the direction you slide it, slide it the wrong way and it will lock for one minute and reset the other panels. Do this until you get through all the panels and your cured for this type. Now me and Akane are going inside toooo… talk, yes, talk about the future of your training."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Ryoga led Akane to his room. The sounds of locking and groaning could be heard from the open window. Akane closed the door as she entered and gently opened her shirt button by button until she stood with her shirt at her feet, her chest only covered by her bra. Ryoga slid under her skirt and gently stroked as Akane undid his pants. Soon only a thin layer of clothes separated them as they lies on his one person bed. Both slid their hands under the final remnants of clothes and removed that final obstacle. Their bodies joined as one and waves of pleasure overtook both. Akane came first, her body racked with an epic orgasm and she finally shrieked as they came together as one. Far from the pleasant afterglow one would expect from this, the mood was quite different.</p><p>"Oh SHIT!" Ryoga muttered as he heard the patio door slide open and light footsteps run towards his door, occasionally going away from the door, but they would be there eventually, "Ranko's coming! Put something on quick!" Ryoga slid her skirt while Akane re-did her shirt. Ryoga pulled the covers to his neck as Ranko opened the door.</p><p>"What happened?" the small girl was panting from running, "I heard you scream, Akane."</p><p>"Yes, Ryoga wasn't feeling well," she was panting for an entirely different reason, "He collapsed and I panicked and screamed."</p><p>"Is he okay?" the small girl reached her hand to touch his, "Is training me to much for him?"</p><p>"Ryoga-kun is just tired Ranko, why don't you get a glass of water for him?"</p><p>"Ok Akane-chan." After Ranko left Akane laid down next to Ryoga and whispered into his ear.</p><p>"I've got a surprise for you lover."</p><p>"What could it be?" Ryoga smiled and spoke with his eyes still closed.</p><p>"Genma wants another heir to the saotome school of anything goes martial arts. More specifically he wants you."</p><p>"Me? Wait, if I was the heir to the school than…" Akane put a finger to his lips.</p><p>"Yes or No."</p><p>"Yes, of course I will" Akane gathered her underwear and stepped towards the door, she turned and winked at him as she stepped out.</p><p>"I'll see you tomorrow, fiancée."</p><p>ON THE WAY BACK HOME</p><p>"I still don't know why you wanted to stop by the beach Ranko." Ranko had insisted on taking the route down to the beach, "We didn't even bring swimsuits or food."</p><p>"I know." The little girl tugged impatiently on Akane's hand as they moved through the crowded beach, "Shampoo said she would train me if I stopped by the beach."</p><p>"Ranko-chan, Shampoo went to go find your, uhh, big-brother. She's not back yet." Ranko's hand tried to pull away from Akane's grip but Akane held tighter, slightly cutting off circulation.</p><p>"You don't have to hold so hard Akane. I passed my lostness and I won't be lost again! Shampoo said she's going to train me and she wouldn't go back on her word."</p><p>"Ranko, you know what Ryoga said." Akane's voice was lined with stern commands, but laced with pity, "This is just the short space before you start a new type of being lost and Shampoo really did leave."</p><p>"No!" Ranko squinted her eyes and began walking and pulling hard on Akane's hand, "He's lying! I'm cured for good this time!"</p><p>"Ranko, slow down, and you said that all the other times, I'm sorry but Ryoga's right."</p><p>"NO! I'm cured this time! Look there's Shampoo's stall!" Ranko tugged even hard and pulled free of Akane's grip in the crowded beach and ran to the shack.</p><p>"Ranma! Come back here! It's not safe for you!"</p><p>"Relax Akane, and stop mixing me up with Ranma, I told you I'm cured!" Ranko pushed the locked door of the shack and couldn't budge it, dejectedly she started back towards Akane, who was trying to push past the crowds of people to get to the little girl. Something snapped inside Ranko's mind and again a familiar feeling rushed into her mind, "No… I'm cured…"</p><p>The crowds of people seemed to tower above and around Ranko as she staggered through the crowd, trying to find Akane. Black faces looked down on her and didn't speak anything but bad thoughts, 'look at the retard kid' 'aww, poor baby lost its mommy' 'dam kids, too young to take care o'themselves.' Ranko was pushed by the waves of people and was swept along, the voices still crying out in her mind. Akane burst into the ground in front of Shampoo's stall and turned around screaming.</p><p>"RANMA! RANMA WHERE ARE YOU! ANSWER ME! PLEASE! Ranma…"</p><p>AT THE HOUSEHOLD WHICH BELONGITH TO RYOGA</p><p>Ryoga was sunning himself on his porch, thinking about becoming the new heir to the Saotome School of anything goes martial arts, and Akane's new fiancée in the process. All of his dreams had come true, sure a few sacrifices had to be made, mainly Ranma's of course, but still they were sacrifices. His rest was broken however when Akane ran up to his house yelling.</p><p>"Ryoga! Please help! Ranma… she… she…", Akane bent over gasping.</p><p>"Whoa, slow down. Where's Ranko?"</p><p>"She… She ran off at the beach! Oh god, what if she went into the water! What if she's in the water Ryoga! Can she even swim! With her direction! Her body won't survive swimming out there for long! Oh God Ryoga…" she fell into his chest crying, "It's all my fault, I should have held onto her tighter, it's all my fault…"</p><p>"Don't say that, I'm sure she's fine, Even with a bad sense of direction I don't think she would go to the water if she couldn't swim." He tried to comfort her and stroked her back, "We'll go to the beach, and we'll find her, then we'll all laugh about this a week from now because you worried so much over something so trivial."</p><p>"Please. We have to hurry, she could have been kidnapped, or she could be alone and afraid on the street somewhere! Come on!" Akane somehow managed to rip Ryoga off his feet and carry him a good half-mile down the road before he got to his feet and started running with her.</p><p>RANMA</p><p>Ranko woke lying on the sand at night, waves crashed and over turned the surf. She quickly sat up and looked around; everyone had long since gone home and she was alone on the beach. A cool wind blew through her hair and she shivered, her clothes were soaked and freezing, they were also meant for sunny weather. As if summoned by the thought that things can't get worse A sharp pain struck again in her mind and the world changed again.</p><p>The sky became a vivid crimson and the waves turned a bright green. The seas foamed and roar while the tides broke on the rocky shore. The waves broke, and thousands of small crabs broke through the surface of the water, each with the face of Ranma-kun and each had claws that crackled with electricity. As if on cue all the crabs began chanting as one.</p><p>"You're Ranko, not Ranma. You're Ranma not Ranko. Who are you? You're Ranko, not Ranma. You're Ranma not Ranko. Who are you?" the crabs began to surround her and draw closer. The small girl whimpered and drew her arms to her body, she shrieked loudly as a crab shocked her left calf.</p><p>"I'm Ranko…" she muttered quietly. As she said the words the crabs backed away, satisfied with their job, but a new threat grew. Two sharp yellow eyes appeared in the sky with cat-like pupils, as the eyes trained on Ranko a mouth appear just below the eyes á la chestier cat from Alice in wonderland and let out a horrible howling scream as it drew closer.</p><p>"I'm Ranma!" the small girl shrieked to her fright from the cat. The crabs began their approach again and two more shocks ripped through her ass and right leg, "I'm Ranko…" she groaned through gritted teeth. The Cat eyes came closer, shrieking madly. Ranko fell to her knees and tucked her arms over her head, then began screaming.</p><p>"Please…" Ranko called to the air, "Please someone help me…" On cue the air where she looked began to ripple, the air itself ripped and let lose a terrible power. Light streamed into this insane world and drove away the fiend crabs, then trained two powerful beams pushing the cat eyes into the blood red sky. Ranko got up off her knees and ran, tears streaming down her face, to the light. As she entered the rift in the air two powerful sets of hands brought her to a safe world, the one she knew. Ranko followed the hands with her eyes and met the pitying face of Ryoga and Akane, Ranko teared up again and cried into Akane's pant leg.</p><p>THE TRIP HOME PART 2</p><p>Ryoga and Akane cradled Ranko between their arms as they hugged each other side by side. She had run up to them and fallen asleep, but occasionally twitched and kicked her legs, she was obviously having some kind of nightmare and kept repeating the phrase 'Who Am I?' over and over again in her sleep. Akane leaned her head against Ryoga's shoulder.</p><p>"Thank you for coming." She said, still staring at the child in her arms, "I guess I never really thought of Ranma as being actually like this until now, she was so alone, and she's so small."</p><p>"We can protect her." Said Ryoga, "We can make sure no harm comes to her ever again."</p><p>"Maybe you're right, I love you so much Ry…what?" Rain gently fell and Ranko's weight increased as Ryoga let his hands go, "Ryoga why did you let go?" She turned to look back at Ryoga, and found P-chan lying in a pile of Ryoga's clothes.</p><p>"Well, I'm completely fucked." Thought Ryoga, preparing to run away, but apart from the anger or hatred, or love (crossed fingers) he had expected to she in her eyes when she had found out, there was none, what was there hurt more than any of those thing combined.

Why didn't you trust me! You sick Bastard! Did you finally have enough of squeezing up to me as a pig! I hate you, don't come back!"
