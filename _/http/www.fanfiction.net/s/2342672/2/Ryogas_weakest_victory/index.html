</div><p>Yes, i have several things to adress from people who keep contacting me.</p><p>1. unless you acually geuss right (showing that you have some knowledge of how storyline progresses) I will not hint towards the end of the story to you.</p><p>2. This will <u>NOT</u> be a pedifilism fic. anyone who suggests this will be hunted down.</p><p>3. any complaints towards the character I choose to attack Ranma will be adressed in this way "he finally snapped, so sad."</p><p>4. no one mentioned this but I should say that keep read passed the beginning of the chapter (for those of you who dislike WAFF stories, because you can trust me that beyond that sappy writing at the beginning of this chapter it is filled with the graphic violence, and drug abusal that your imaginations crave so much. (yes drug abusal, please read it's acually fairly good, one of my faviorite parts.</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>Bring, Bring Bring, Bring click</p><p>"Hello?" the sweet voice of Kasumi entered the receiver.</p><p>"Yes, is this a one, Acne Tendo?"</p><p>"No, it's pronounced A-ka-ne and this is her sister, Kasumi."</p><p>"Oh, sorry. Well, do you know a Ranma Saotome?"</p><p>"Ranma? Where is he? Is he okay?"</p><p>"She's fine; this is the south regional hospital of Shenlo city. She has recovered nicely and needs to be picked up."</p><p>"Oh, of course. Thank you so much for calling."</p><p>"Thank you for your time."</p><p>After hanging up Kasumi announced where Ranma was and that he was fine. There was much rejoicing (please no lawsuits, this is a homage, or a tribute, or something to that effect…). The Tendo family used Genma's ill-gotten life savings to rent a car and began a long journey to Ranma and Ryoga's training ground.</p><p>"Move over Nabiki."</p><p>"I'll consider it for 100 yen."</p><p>"Here."</p><p>"Blow the man down baby, blow the man down!"</p><p>"Dad, your drunk, pull over and let me drive."</p><p>Next morning</p><p>Akane walked up to the hospital clerk and asked for Ranma Saotome's room.</p><p>"Hmm, hold on, ahh" The clerk muttered as he scrolled through the computers admission files, "here we go, Ranma Saotome, pediatrics, child ward."</p><p>"Child Ward?" all asked at once.</p><p>A kindly looking old nurse who said she got to know Ranma led them to a panel of one way glass. Inside was a room filled with about 15 kids, all giggling and playing with toys or being read to, they were all under the age of 7.</p><p>"I'm sorry." Remarked Soun, "we must be thinking of a different Ranma."</p><p>"You are the Tendo family aren't you?" inquired the aging nurse, "Ranma talked about all of you non-stop since her voice returned. She has such an active mind for someone so young."</p><p>"Two things wrong with that!" said Akane, her voice rising in anger and disappointment, "one: Ranma's a guy. Two: He's 16. Sorry for taking up your time."</p><p>"Yes, when she's splashed with hot water." All looked in surprise at the mention of hot water, "I heard her father tried to use the mental problem she gained from that to try and turn her into some kind of weapon! It's good she's so young; once her brother came in and told us the details we were able to help her. Ranko's finally good as new."</p><p>All eyes and mouths dropped at the mention of Ranma's girl name. Everyone rushed into the room and found who they were looking for. A small girl with bright red hair playing with dolls with a group of other little girls. Upon seeing who barged in she smiled widely and ran up to Akane.</p><p>"Akane, Akane!" the excited little girl yelled, "you gotta meet my new friends!"</p><p>Ranma's eyes glittered with innocence and hope that had never been seen before. Akane saw this little girl and did what came naturally; she gave her a long, deep hug.</p><p>Ranma and Kasumi played a clapping game called pat-a-cake, apparently English. The Tendo family had met with Ranma as Genma had gone on the warpath, trying to find who had ruined more than 10 years of grooming and preparation for someone to take over the Saotome School of anything goes martial arts. Genma had located one Dr. Boyle who had apparently spearheaded 'helping' Ranma and brought the Tendo's in to hear his explanation. All sat on foldout chairs facing a T.V. holding a surveillance tape. Kasumi was showing real motherhood abilities and was constantly hugging and blowing raspberries on Ranma-chans squirming stomach.</p><p>"Now I warn you" spoke a heavily bleeding Dr. Boyle, "what you see may be graphic, anyone with a weak constitution may want to consider leaving the room."</p><p>Soun glanced to the door quickly then back to the TV. Dr. Boyle turned on the camera record and left the room to seek medical help from Genma's savage beating. The camera showed the dimly lit room and the back of a young man's head. They were in the office the boy had stood in.</p><p>"Ranko had a rough childhood, Doctor, taken away from her mother and brother and driven to insanity and violence by her father. She tried to take the name and adventures of the only other teenage boy she knew as her own, my exploits."</p><p>The Tendo's looked disgusted at the boy on the screen. A cheap camera had highly fragmented his face but his voice was familiar.</p><p>"Last I heard she was training with pops near here, he must have pushed her to hard and she fell into the river."</p><p>"That's appalling!" remarked Dr. Boyle on the TV, "can anything be done to help Ranko-chan?"</p><p>"Good that you asked, I do have a plan, but I need your help. Do you have any materials here for treating behavior problems?"</p><p>The screen goes fuzzy as it skips to the next scene of a separate room. The room is lit from the corners; it has a chair in the middle that is attached to a console panel. Dr. Boyle and the mystery Ranma stand by the control panel and door respectively. Ranma-chan in Kasumi's arms began to cry out and tried to get to the floor.</p><p>"Please! I don't want to! TURN IT OFF!"</p><p>Kasumi holds Ranma to her chest as the grim spectacle unfolds. Ranma-chan screams and covers her ears.</p><p>On the screen Ranma-chan is pushed into the room and scooped up by the fake Ranma. She is placed into the chair at the center of the room and her legs and chest are strapped down. Finally, to the horror of everyone watching, electrodes are attached to her fingers and clamped on by the fake Ranma.</p><p>"Who are you!" the Ranma-chan in Kasumi's arms and the one on the screen shriek in tandem. The figure ignores this and asks her a question.</p><p>"What is your name?"</p><p>"Ranma Saotome" Ranma answers quickly and is silenced by a loud buzzer and screams out as a charge of electricity flows through her. She sits deep into the chair and begins to cry as she removes the electrodes off each hand. The fake Ranma steps up and holds her arms with one hand as he reattaches the clamps and wires, and calmly speaks as he does it,</p><p>"No, Ranko, you are not Ranma, that was a delusion thought up by you feverish mind. Now stop crying, you are 4 years old and your name is Ranko Saotome." The figure steps back, "Now, what is your name?"</p><p>"R-ranma…" another screaming cry rouses the child in Kasumi's arms to do the same; Soun quickly rushes to a wastebasket and is physically ill.</p><p>"No, Ranko, that is wrong again. Okay one more time. What is your name?" Ranma seizes and sobs while looking straight up.</p><p>"R-ranko sob, my name is Ranko." The figure of the sick fake Ranma smiles and begins to disconnect the wires.</p><p>"That's very good for today Ranko; we'll keep doing this every day for as long as it takes till you are well again." The camera fades to static but the room is still filled with the screaming of the small girl in Kasumi's arms.</p><p>"Don't do it again! I'm Ranko, Don't do it again! I'm Ranko, Don't do it again! I'm Ranko…" Ranma keeps repeating the phrase as Nabiki and Akane join their father at the wastebasket. Kasumi wraps her body around Ranma's wailing form and whispers.</p><p>"Shh, don't cry, don't cry, you're safe now, he can't hurt you anymore…" We fade to black with Ranma whimpering in the background.</p><p>Chapter 2: Later That Night</p><p>Inside Ranma's head a fight raged on. A small girl with her in two pigtails argued with a teenage boy with a single pigtail.</p><p>"She's Ranko" stated the small embodiment of childhood, "I wouldn't be here if she wasn't."</p><p>"If it wasn't for that bastard and his goddamn mushroom…" replied the older figure, "I've been here for a whole crapload longer than you. What does that tell you?"</p><p>"I'm here now, you leave, and I'm staying'"</p><p>"You can't. The vessel doesn't want to be like this."</p><p>"The vessel doesn't know what it wants; besides, it always wanted to get away from the problems of its life. It will if it chooses me."</p><p>"The vessel loves the girl Akane; he will not choose you willingly."</p><p>"Then I will force it to."</p><p>"You'll do more damage than good if the others find another mushroom."</p><p>"You know as well as I do that there are no more mushrooms."</p><p>"We don't know that."</p><p>"In the occasion that one is found, you can reclaim control."</p><p>"Too much damage will be done to the vessel at that point."</p><p>"Then what do you suggest we do? "</p><p>"Wake up the vessel and search the forest for another mushroom."</p><p>"Fine, I can handle that, let's go."</p><p>Ranma awoke in a hospital bed next to Akane. She had apparently slumped down beside Ranma when she had passed out. Ranma smiled and brushed the hair out of Akane's face as she slipped out of the small bed, replaced the pigtail, and put on the overalls and shirt given to her by her new friend. Ranma glanced at Akane and climbed onto a chair, out the open window, and towards the forest.</p><p>Two hours later</p><p>A small girl dressed in pink climbed over a hurdle of tree roots and into the clearing that all this had started in. The memories of the more gory parts were still suppressed by the rational part of her mind. Ranma however, could still remember the feelings in this place and it made her uneasy.</p><p>A quick search of the area revealed several large mushrooms, about a half dozen with various sizes, shapes, and colors. Ranma popped a white mushroom into her mouth and chewed cautiously. No effect from that one. Ranma picked up the second mushroom, a slightly brownish black color. Ranma pressed it to her lips and chewed. A sharp pain hit her gut a couple of seconds later after she swallowed.</p><p>The forest began to melt in Ranma's mind. Her body grew to exactly as she wanted, her fully endowed sixteen year old body. She squealed excitedly and ran towards the hospital, ignoring the fact that her clothes had grown with her she decided to focus on the melting forest.</p><p>The trees drained to the ground and were replaced with a hazy black background. Ranma's eyes dilated wildly as Akane formed from the black ground. Akane had grown a few inches and her hair was tied into the same hairstyle as she had when Ranma had first met her. Akane face had more character and looked older.</p><p>"Akane!" slurred Ranma, the mushrooms poison entered her mind and her eyes continued to widen and contract, "I-I found the muhssrom, I'm back!" She stumbled and tripped on her words.</p><p>"Why little Ranma-chan," Akane smiled a soft motherly smile, "You've grown so much! I remember when you only stood up to my waist." Akane rubbed Ranma's hair and gauged her height.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"You were so cute back then! To think that was 12 years ago. So amusing."</p><p>What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Akane?" a familiar but deeper voice called out, "Who are you talking to?"</p><p>A bandana clad man appeared from the darkness where Akane sprang up. Ryoga's face was slightly scarred from years of fighting; his muscles and shoulders were a bit wider, his eyes were soft from years of bliss spent with his family. He led followed by an 8-year-old boy. Akane ran into his arms, hugged him deeply, and then let go to pick up her child.</p><p>"Ranma, dear." She smiled, "look how well she grown! Say hi to your cousin goshiniki."</p><p>"Hi Ranma!" chirped the small boy.</p><p>The Hibiki family smiled, waved and melted into the darkness. Two new forms shaped form the darkness. Genma and Nadoka held a squirming infant in their arms.</p><p>"He will be a man among men," Genma claimed in his old fashion as he raised the child to the sky, "You have my oath as a man in this!"</p><p>"My children do not need the art, Genma." Spoke Nadoka as she took her child back into her arms, "Ranma left me for ten years and came back to me as a 4-year-old girl. I don't know if you planned that because you know for me a kill my 4-year-old daughter who has no idea for the obligation given by her would be impossible for me, or if I just came in at a bad time, it doesn't matter. I won't have you wrecking his life like Ranma's."</p><p>"Ranma's life is fine." Retorted Genma, "She lost the art but we gained a rich son."</p><p>Ranma's parents drifted into the darkness and a sharp pain hit Ranma's stomach as a house began to form around her. A small child ran into the room with sprawled black hair shouted excitedly.</p><p>"Mommy, Daddy!" A wide grin on his face revealed a missing tooth, "the tooth fairy came, I got a 100 yen coin!"</p><p>"That's great junior." A familiar voice rang out next to Ranma, "let me and your mom see it."</p><p>"Ranma looked down at her body, her overalls and shirt were replaced by a silk nightie. She stood next to a large bed that spanned ten feet across in a room that looked fit for a king. Kuno scooted across the bed and stood next to Ranma.</p><p>"How's the baby today?" his hand touched a suddenly expanded belly and Ranma screamed and screamed.</p><p>A small redheaded girl was brought in by a man who had been hiking in the woods. Her pupils were heavily dilated and she was obviously hallucinating. Her temperature was high and slight swelling occurred in her throat and temples. She lied on the table groaning weakly.</p><p>Several mushrooms were inside her overalls and traces around her lips. Her stomach was pumped and anti-venom was attached to her via I.V. The Tendo family and Genma were alerted to what happened and immediately flocked to the room Ranma was being tended to in.</p><p>"What happed doctor?" Genma asked to the poison control doctor that tended to Ranma, "Will my son be alright?"</p><p>"Son? Uhh, well the poison from the mushroom is hallucinogenic," The doctors eyes were red from to many hours of work, "So long-term damage might result if it's as bad as I believe it might be. The damage will be easier to tell once I get a cat-scan. We're also giving her some anti-venom, but if she makes it through the night will be the real test."</p><p>Ranma's arms and legs were twitching slightly as the poison worked it's way through her system.</p><p>Inside Ranma's Head</p><p>The argument between the Ranko persona and the Original Ranma raged on.</p><p>"Look at this place!' screamed Ranko persona pointing to the warping areas of their reality, "Your escapade with the mushroom has done more damage than I could dream of doing!"</p><p>"The vessels fault." stated the Ranma persona with a look of arrogance and denial, "The vessel couldn't tell the difference between the mushrooms."</p><p>"No difference from what has happened. You have to leave, I have much to repair."</p><p>"You listen to me! This body has been through much worse! If you think this is bad, just wait until its enemies get wind of the state it's in!"</p><p>"I'll get help if I can't help the vessel face them."</p><p>"NO! That is not how we work!"</p><p>"In all respect Ranma-kun, Ranko-chan is my responsibly now."</p><p>Ranma-kun roared with hatred and fury as the small girl spread throughout the body.</p>
