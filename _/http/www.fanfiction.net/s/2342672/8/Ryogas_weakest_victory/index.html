</div><p>Later on-</p><p>Ryoga awoke in a guest room on the second floor. His muscles felt like they were on fire and he felt a sharp pain when he inhaled, at least one or two ribs were broken. His left eye was swollen shut from Akane's midair connections, and his ki was completely drained. Ryoga was about to call for Akane to come into the room as the door pushed open to reveal Kasumi holding a bowl of soup and a cup of tea on a tray.</p><p>"Ryoga-san," Ryoga winced at the ending, noticing that not even Kasumi really acknowledged him as a friend in this house anymore, "You were out for two days, we were verging on hooking you up to an I.V. so you wouldn't starve."</p><p>"How's Akane doing?" Ryoga tried to sit up in bed before falling back, holding his ribs.</p><p>Kasumi pretended not to notice the pain, but Ryoga could see that parental gleam in her eye as he clutched his shattered bones, "She was pretty exhausted from the fight, but she didn't sleep for a fraction of your time. After you finish eating, we have a surprise."</p><p>"Surprise?" Ryoga muttered into the tea he was drinking, still feeling depressed, "What? Is Akane making pork chops?"</p><p>"Don't be silly Ryoga-san," Again another wince, "Your cursed form wouldn't nearly be big enough to feed us all…"</p><p>Ryoga spat up into his tea and watched Kasumi leave the room, wondering whether or not the homemaker had been joking. Ryoga shrugged this off and continued his food, knowing that whatever the surprise was, anything his depressed mind would come up with would be much worse.</p><p>Ryoga was halfway finished his soup when a light knock resounded on the door. He spoke softly, trying to not sound ungrateful to anybody on the other side as he beckoned for them to come in. Ryoga half expected Akane and Mallet-sama to be there with the enhanced soba strength, preparing for Ryoga's beating, but the only person who stepped in with his small hands clasped over a small jar was Ryoga's former enemy.</p><p>"Ryoga-kun" Ranma smiled as he extended his hands holding the jar, "Kasumi says this'll make you feel better. Thanks for staying when I was sick."</p><p>"R-ranma…" Ryoga stuttered quietly as he took the jar chokingly, "It wasn't me that did anything, Akane and Kasumi did it all and… I'm just a jackass for everything… I'm sorry for everything I did. I wish- I wish I could let everything go back to normal."</p><p>"Things are normal Ryoga-kun" Ranma tilted his head to the side quizzically as he thought about what Ryoga said, "You mean Akane? She got real mad at you, what'd you do? Did you take something from her?"</p><p>"Pride maybe…." Muttered Ryoga as he unscrewed the lid of the jar, revealing a foul-smelling white cream that seemed to have something that vaguely resembled a layer of spit on the top, "Uhh… Ranma? You didn't give this to anyone before you got it, did you?"</p><p>"Ranko, but I do probably look like my brother like this. Anyway Uncle Soun checked it before I gave it," The small boy got a concerned look on his face, "Is something wrong with the gift Ryoga-kun?"</p><p>Ryoga looked grimly at the contaminated cream as his finger pushed into it, "No… it's just, well…" He sighed heavily as he met the small boys gaze and lowered his head, "Nope, no problem with it." Ryoga removed a small glob with his fingers and rubbed it into an infected wound, both boys wincing from the smell.</p><p>Another knock on the door caused both boys the turn their heads as Kasumi head pushed into the room while saying, "Ryoga, have you seen Ranma, he needs to take his medici-" she cut off as her eyes locked on the small boy and smiled, "Ahh, there you are, I was afraid you had gotten lost, c'mon it's time for your medicine Ranma-chan"</p><p>Kasumi walked up and lifted the small boy with ease. As she turned to leave the room, she looked over her shoulder and made a small smile to Ryoga. She left the room with Ranma as Ryoga went about removing the probably poisonous cream off of his open wounds with the corner of the bedspread.</p><p>Later that day -</p><p>"Are you insane?" Soun sobbed out between his streams of tears, not that that was hard, he cried because it was partly cloudy once, "Him!"</p><p>"We have no choice?" he pleaded with Soun, "According to Happosai, the mushroom forest supposed to be a sacred place guarded by monks and mushroom farmers that have lived for thousands of years, It was a miracle Ryoga found his way in."</p><p>"We could still try!" Soun composed himself before bursting out crying again, "It doesn't matter, I won't allow it."</p><p>"You don't have a choice in the matter, I have previously trained Ryoga in the Saotome schools art and he is the perfect choice for Ranma's replacement, just until we find a cure."</p><p>"He molested my daughter!"</p><p>"He loves her!"</p><p>"She hates him!"</p><p>"Lovers quarrel!"</p><p>"You need my consent."</p><p>"You don't and I tell everyone that those aren't really your wife's ashes in that urn."</p><p>"We were drunk! You can't blame me; I didn't spill those on purpose."</p><p>"We're always drunk; I'd have to expect you'd have some kind of resistance to it by now."</p><p>"We're getting off topic here. No, that man is not going to inherit the school. No, he is not marrying my youngest daughter. And, finally, No, nothing you say will make me take back my promise."</p><p>"Do it or I tell everyone the reason you cry is a psychic disorder coming from the fact that you wet the bed for the first 12 years of your life."</p><p>"That's a damn lie!"</p><p>"Who are they going to believe crybaby? Who?"</p><p>Genma and Soun walked out of the parlor after lots of screaming of various odd words like 'love' 'molest' and 'bedwetting' were heard, one after another, each emitting an intense depression ki. Genma spoke to the air in front of him.</p><p>"Someone get Ryoga, we need to speak of his future."</p><p>Nabiki glanced over at Kasumi trying to get the little ranma to take his medicine, his head glancing to the side when her spoon came close. Then over to Akane, sitting cross-legged, holding a vanity mirror and shaving her moustache in front of it, only 2-3 weeks until the cure for the soba came in the mail. The financial expert of the family sighed and pushed herself of her chair and down the hall. She returned hoisting Ryoga's left arm over her shoulders, supporting his massive frame with her small one.</p><p>"Your package sir" Nabiki murmured quietly, "Where should I drop it?"</p><p>"Set him down in a chair Nabiki" Soun said with ice in his voice, "….A hard one."</p><p>Nabiki walked Ryoga's battered body to a metal folding chair. Her actions earned a grunt from Ryoga as his naked top hit the cold metal and wince of pain from his broken ribs. Ryoga sat in silent terror about his situation; once again he sat in front of the entire Tendo Household, waiting for judgment. Genma spoke first.</p><p>"Ryoga" he started, "I want to be blunt in this fact, you were Ranma's biggest rival, you trained with me, you know the Saotome arts from Ranma, and you already seem to know the family." Another wave of cold resounded from the family, "I want you to take over the Saotome School of martial arts. Only until we can find a cure for Ranma, you understand that, right?"</p><p>"What!" Ranma broke out, claiming a pose of worry, "What happened to Ranma? Where's my brother!"</p><p>"I think you don't need to listen to this" Said Kasumi as she hoisted the small squirming child up by his armpits and slung him around her shoulder, "Maybe we should go to the next room."</p><p>"No! Please! I want to hear what happened!" Ranma squirmed as tears came to his young eyes, "What happened to my big brother! Stop!"</p><p>Ryoga and Akane watched the matriarch take Ranma in the next room, still wailing about her imaginary brother. Both felt a heavy pain of betrayal on their chests and hearts as the wails grew dimmer and faded into sobs. Genma spoke again.</p><p>"As you see, the memory problem is still very intense; I don't think there will be a cure soon. But, beyond that, what is your answer."</p><p>Ryoga's jaw moved but no sound escaped his lips, his chest was on fire and he felt hot sick raise in his throat, his temples pulsed and his brain ached to understand what was happening. Ryoga calmed himself down and concentrated on the words that would not come.</p><p>"I-I'll do it…" Ryoga shifted his head to Akane, who stared at the ground as tears fell down her cheeks, "Please, I love you so much, don't leave me."</p><p>As the last words left his lips, Akane got up and ran out of the room, leaving the room the filled her with those feelings.</p><p>Later that day-</p><p>Genma and Soun were dressed in white robes, they sat cross legged across from Ryoga, similarly dressed in White robes, but was sitting on a large pillow to help support his body. The other Tendo's and Ranma sat to the left and watched the Ritual. Ranma still struggled to find out what had happened.</p><p>"Ryoga Hibiki" Genma started, his voice was serious and intense, "Do you accept the responsibilities needed by the one to inherit the Saotome School of martial arts?"</p><p>"I do." was his quick reply</p><p>"Ryoga Hibiki. The one who accepts the responsibilities needed," Soun spoke this time, his voice filled with fire and ice, "Do you accept the fact that you are honor bound to defend this school against all comers?"</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"Ryoga Hibiki, Honor guard of the saotome school" Genma again, "Do you understand all conditions and take the title of heir to the Saotome School?"</p><p>Ryoga glanced over to Akane as she played with Ranma's red hair, not even paying attention to the proceedings as she smiled at the small girl. Ryoga's heart felt heavy, "I do."</p><p>"Congratulations, Ryoga Hibiki, Heir to the Saotome school of martial arts."</p><p>There was no celebration in that room and all stayed silent as they filed out to their rooms, occasionally a small sniffle broke the silence.</p>
