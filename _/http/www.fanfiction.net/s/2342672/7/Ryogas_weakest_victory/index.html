</div><p>I'm incredibly sorry for not getting this up soon, but many extinuating curcumstances such as lack of inspiration and falling ill made it hard to finish this story, as well as world of warcraft (it's too damn addicting). I want to thank everybody that I talked to about how my Fanfic should finish, and I want everybody within the, er, sight of my type to read dana-san's fanfiction as soon as she finishes.</p><p>NEXT DAY</p><p>"Please, just let me talk to her!" Ryoga pushed up against the doorframe while trying to convince Soun to let him in, "Please, I never would never mean to hurt her. Just let us talk and I'm sure we can patch things up."</p><p>"You don't know women very well, do you son?" Soun clicked his tongue and shook his head, "You've secretly slept with her for at least a year before you too ever started going out, what could you have possibly said to make that ok?"</p><p>"Like you tried to stop us?" Ryoga's hand began to indent the wall, "You knew I was P-chan since the beginning when I turned back while you were taking a bath."</p><p>Soun glanced downwards, "yes, well. Saotome and I were hitting the bottle pretty hard that night and I assumed you were an alcohol induced illusion."</p><p>"I don't have time for this!" Ryoga's hand pushed Soun aside by the neck and he charged into the living room yelling, "AKANE! I need to talk with you! I'm sorry for everything, please; I just want a chance to talk!"</p><p>Kasumi hurried past the boy, carrying a damp rag into the hallway. Ryoga stepped quickly after her trying to find Akane's whereabouts. Kasumi stepped silently into a room and was knocked to the left as Akane stepped into the hall to face Ryoga.</p><p>"Leave. Now." Akane's eyes looked red from crying and exhaustion, "I told you I never want to see you or your horrible curse ever again."</p><p>"Please Akane, I could have told you in the first place because it would have made me look like a pervert!"</p><p>"So choice number 2 was to continue sleeping with me and hoping that you wont be caught!"</p><p>"Ironically…"Ryoga was cut off by a cry from the room and Kasumi's stifled sob, "Wait, what going on in there?" He tried to push passed Akane into the room as her hand caught his arm and flipped him down the hall into some conveniently placed Samurai armor (including sword, naginata, etc.).</p><p>"Nothing we aren't already handling." Akane's teeth were clenched together and her eyes threatened to begin tearing up, "GO! NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE!"</p><p>"It's Ranko, isn't it?" Ryoga picked himself off the armor and began walking down the hall, "Please, I can help her."</p><p>"His name is RANMA!" Akane shrieked down the hall as she clenched her fists, "And we've had enough of your 'help'. You've done more damage now then ever!"</p><p>"What!" Ryoga's eyes opened wide, "What's going on, I have to see!"</p><p>Ryoga pushed down the hallway and pushed his body into the doorframe before Akane could stop him, the door splintered and shattered under his push. Kasumi was still tending to Ranma/Ranko in the room and didn't look up from the sound of the door shattering. Ranma was in boy form, a wet towel draped across his head and he moaned quietly mumbling incoherent phrases. Ranma was still young from the mushroom, the curse hadn't changed that.</p><p>"We thought turning him into a boy again might help," Kasumi's eyes were red and it was apparent that she had stayed up all night by ranma's side, "Ranma's always been a bit stronger as a boy."</p><p>"That won't help" Ryouga's eyes glazed as he drifted back into his memories of the 7th year of his life, a time filled with shadows and darkness. Ryoga hobbled through the darkness, shadow forms muttered dark whispers as he passed, holding his hands to his head trying to block out something that couldn't be blocked. his tears streamed like everyday back then. His tears would fall until the darkness became all consuming and his mind fell into unconsciousness, "I'm so sorry for bringing this on…"</p><p>"What?" Akane snapped up at that last remark, "What do you mean, bringing this on? What happened!"</p><p>"Uhm…" stammered Ryoga silently screaming because he believed himself to be discovered, "I meant that the anti-lost training probably accelerated how long it took him to reach this state."</p><p>"Now Ryoga-kun." Kasumi spoke before Akane could ask more about what he said or start on the attack, "You meant the best, but this is another of your little bad-direction things. How do you get out of this one?"</p><p>"I-I…" Ryoga's eyes began to shift wildly and finally settled on the floor, "I'm so sorry, I don't know…"</p><p>Ryoga's Mind- age 7 !</p><p>'More shadows… their endless. I'll never see mom, dad, anyone again… I'm sorry for getting lost again; please don't get angry again, I'm sorry.' Ryoga's chest heaved in this place. The weight of his clothes seemed too heavy, Ryoga feel to his knee's and gave up his body as the weight of the increasingly heavier clothes dragged him into the thick shadows. He swam in darkness and felt the deep pressure push into his lungs as he passed out.</p><p>Ryoga's eyes opened into a bright light. Of course, after about 2 weeks of straight black any light is bright. His Parents had, for once, gathered in one place and watched as the doctor pulled a needle out of his left arm. Most concentrated on any sign of intelligence from the boy other than the occasional mumble.</p><p>"Mom? Dad? Where am I? What happened to the dark?" Ryoga's mom shrieked in happiness and hugged every living thing in the room before picking up her son and holding him close.</p><p>"I'm so happy…" she whispered into his ear, "You finally woke up. I thought we'd never see your beautiful eyes again my wonderful baby."</p><p>"What! That was a nightmare?"</p><p>"One that lasted 2 horrible weeks. Shh, it's all over now."</p><p>Ryoga snapped out of his memory and back into the present. Akane glared at him while Kasumi tended to the wailing child. He rubbed his eyes from dirt and sleep and looked deeply at Akane.</p><p>"Please, don't be angry. I can't fix this." Ryoga watched Akane's eyes drop to stare at Ranma lying on the makeshift bed, "I woke up from a serum, I don't know what it was, I'm so sorry."</p><p>"Wait!" Kasumi spoke up, raising her voice, "This is just a way of being lost right?"</p><p>"Ya…" Ryoga spoke softly with confusion.</p><p>"Then we just have to give Ranma his medicine and hell snap out of it!"</p><p>"That's right!" Akane's eyes lit up and she streamed out the door into the hall closet. After sorting through Kasumi's assortment of pills and medicinal aids she came to a small prescription bottle near the middle, "If you ever needed a time to work, please be now."</p><p>Akane popped two pills into the small boy's mouth as Kasumi propped him upright and put a drinking glass to his mouth. Ranma swallowed and coughed and fell into a deeper sleep. Akane looked shattered but Kasumi took her arm.</p><p>"It's okay, maybe it'll take a bit longer to work, ill make you some tea so you can sleep, you must be tired." Kasumi and Akane walked into the kitchen, leaving Ryoga and Ranma alone in the room.</p><p>"You better appreciate this you bastard!" Ryoga propped up the boy and slipped two pills from the real pills in his left pocket into his mouth, following it up with some water from the glass to his left, "C'mon, swallow the damn meds you jerk, do you live to torment me like this?"</p><p>Ryoga sighed as Ranma brought the pills to the back of his throat and choked slightly as he pushed them down his throat. Ranma relaxed and opened one of his eyes slightly before falling to sleep again.</p><p>Ryoga stepped out of the room and shut the door behind him. As he walked to the back door to try and avoid the family he heard a faint call from the kitchen, "Ryoga? Come here for a second."</p><p>Ryoga shivered as he heard Akane call, he just knew this would lead to another misunderstanding. The pig-boy slid the paper wall open and walked into the kitchen, he noticed the temperature got at least 10 degree's colder as he felt the icy stares of the Tendo family boring into him. Akane spoke first.</p><p>"Ryoga, in 10 words or less, justify sleeping with me for a year, without me knowing." For once her voice held calm, with a far-off tone to it.</p><p>"You were the first person to show me compassion, I lo-" Ryoga was cut off by Nabiki quickly.</p><p>"That's more than 10."</p><p>"I know that!" Snapped Ryoga, "It's impossible to explain this in that amount of time. Akane, it was fairly obvious to begin with how I felt about you. I never came back here without bringing you a gift; I tried at least 5 separate times to use magic or spiritual powers to either confess my love to you or to get you to love me. Hell, I was verging on bringing back a dead god before I confessed my love too you! Please understand that I couldn't stand being away from you for even one second more than I had too, even if it meant spending that time as your pet!"</p><p>Akane stared down at her tea for the entire time Ryoga spoke. Even after he finished Akane still refused to make eye contact with Ryoga. After an excruciatingly long minute Akane finally spoke.</p><p>"Go to the dojo." Akane spoke softly while bringing the tea up to her face, "I'll meet you there in 10 minutes, I have to prepare something first."</p><p>Ryoga nodded dumbly, he stood shakily and made his way out to the back door, not even bothering to push the paper door aside he just pushed through and into the dojo. During the ten minutes he spent waiting on the cold wood floor he heard arguments and running water coming from the house. Silence reined for a few seconds after all the water and talking had stopped and Ryoga heard light footsteps walking to the dojo. Akane pushed the door aside roughly, causing one end to splinter the other wall.</p><p>"Fight me." Akane smiled a smile that one can only see on the face of a person that gave up everything for power, "Fight me and try to win, widdle P-chan."</p><p>"Akane? What happened? What'd you do?"</p><p>Akane brought her face up to eye level and stepped forward, as her left leg hit the ground she disappeared. Ryoga stared at the spot shakily before his senses automatically kicked in and he blocked a near invisibly fast kick to his side. Ryoga rebounded of the kick into the top corner of the dojo and tried to trace Akane's movement with his eyes before a downward punch caught him right between the eyes and pushed him tree feet into the dojo floor. Ryoga moaned quietly as he brought himself to his feet.</p><p>"Man Akane, were you always this fast?" Ryoga rubbed the spot where her punch had connected, normally only Ranma had that kind of strength to a punch, "you must have liked getting rescued by Ranma to fake that so well."</p><p>"Wasn't faking." Akane's voice came from directly behind Ryoga, "I knew you wouldn't fight me for real with my natural strength, so I borrowed some of grandpa Happosai's Super Soba. If you don't fight me now, at your full strength, than you die."</p><p>Ryoga closed his eyes and dropped back, swinging his arm to catch her in the neck, trying to disable her without any real harm. His fist only connected with air as he felt Akane's ki fly around him to his front. Ryoga continued the spin and tried to connect on the forward punch but didn't connect. He stopped in wonder for a split second. Her ki didn't move, so where was she? Ryoga looked down as Akane's foot shot straight up into his mouth from her crouching position on the floor and pushed the pig-boy into the air.</p><p>For once Ryoga's nose streamed blood for an entirely different reason as he sailed into the air, his concentration to shattered to notice Akane's rapidly approaching ki until it had already connected with his body. Each of Akane's mid air kicks propelled Ryoga higher and harder until he shattered the hard wood roof. Ryoga's body fell to the floor again on to the pile on broken wood from his last landing. Ryoga stood up to the center of the dojo and shook his head.</p><p>"I originally planned this for Ranma's high speed attacks, but if you insist on this for me to prove my love." Ryoga's eyes closed as he gathered all the depressive ki he had felt from the last 24 hours, "Try this! Lions Shattering Roar!"</p><p>Ryoga spun his arms around, pointing at the floor while firing off needle thin rays of his heavy ki into the floor. The dojo glowed where it was struck for a split second before shattering along in a spider web formation along the floor and bringing up logs of wood from the dojo's structure. Ryoga's eye's sharpened as his felt the vibrations in the air from Akane stumbling on the exposed material. He spun to face her.</p><p>"Let's see how well you're Soba strength is compared to my hard work." Ryoga grinned knowing this was in the bag as Akane started to snicker, "What's so funny?"</p><p>"I was actually planning on using the speed as a way of showing you up without making you feel too bad." Akane rubbed some of the already forming whiskers on her upper lip as she adopted a tai-jitsu stance, "But if I have to crush you this way it'll work too!"</p><p>Akane launched off a piece of exposed wood and plunged her fist into Ryoga's guard. He felt his muscles give as her punch blew him into the dojo wall. Ryoga's balance returned in mid air as he pushed himself into the air from a support and funneled his remaining depressive ki into a ki ball.</p><p>"SHI SHI HOKODAN!" Ryoga called out the name of his attack as the energy left his hands and poured into the ground beneath him, completely removing the dojo's remaining floor and catching Akane in the bouncing repercussions. Ryoga watched the energy dissipate into the air with some grim satisfaction that he hadn't lost to the girl he loved. An immense ki snapped Ryoga out of his dreams as Akane pushed out of the ki energy holding a small ball that she had gathered from his blast, rapidly funneling her own borrowed strength into the energy to make it pulse blue.</p><p>"I'll take a page from Ranma's book here Ryoga! Shi Shi Hokodan revised! Prides Roar!" Akane's massive blue energy ball left her finger tips and caught Ryoga straight in the chest. Ripping apart his clothes and pummeling his muscles into a soft goo as the power released into his body. Ryoga fell to the floor unconscious as Akane slumped over gasping.</p><p>Kasumi slid open the closed door and looked at the massive carnage within, "Oh my, I better call the carpenters again. I wonder if they would give us a discount if I baked them some pie."</p><p>"Make up a guest room while you do that, would you Kasumi?"</p><p>"Oh? For who?"</p><p>"P-chan won't be able to move for a while, better make him somewhere to rest."</p><p>"That reminds me! I came to tell you that Ranma's awake! He's asking for Ryoga."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Something about thanking him for staying with him, I couldn't tell, he was mumbling pretty badly still."</p><p>"What does he mean staying with him? He was there for a half minute."</p><p>"Maybe Ryoga-kun remembered something after we left and healed him. Ryoga can be a nice boy at times, if a little moronic. I'll go make that guest bed."</p><p>Akane watched her sister leave and then drew her attention to the bandana clad boy at her feet. She sighed heavily and wiped her head as she flipped him onto her back and made her way to the house.</p>
