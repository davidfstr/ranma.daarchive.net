</div><p>"Bankosai tenketsu!"</p><p>A rock shattered into oblivion and flung its self into the reaches of the forest as Ranma dodged Ryoga's blow. Ryoga's eyes rose to see Ranma leaping into the air, dodging his attack. He crossed his arms and concentrated on the fact that this was the only one standing between him and his happiness with his sweet Akane, that Ranma had ruined his life and the bastard had any choice of a woman but chose the one only one that had made him happy.</p><p>"SHI SHI HOKODON", the scream rang through the forest as the blast collided with his foe, disintegrating him as it continued to consume row after row of trees, "I did it… he's gone. Akane will finally have a real man to look after her."</p><p>Ryoga stopped for a second to think about the implications of what he had just done. His memories strayed to thoughts about how Ranma had showed him to his two loves, how he helped him remove the mark of the battling god, and how he pushed him to be better at every turn. These thoughts however were crumpled up and thrown away as thoughts of Ranma beating him into the ground, cursing him, fooling him into thinking he had a sister, a fiancée, and a maid, and making his life a living hell refreshed his hatred. Through the hate he laughed from the heart of the forest.</p><p>Ryoga awoke from his happy dream and sighed heavily, since the beginning of his with Ranma in the dense forest 2 weeks ago these dreams had taunted him. He glanced over at the pigtailed boys sleeping form and drew his umbrella. The tip hovered at the connection of his spine and skull.</p><p>"He wouldn't even feel any pain" he whispered under his breath, "it would be like drifting into a peaceful dream." He contemplated this for a few seconds and finally lowered his weapon.</p><p>"Not a helpless foe." Ryoga thought weakly, "I wouldn't deserve love from anyone if I did anything so cowardly." Ryoga stared at the night sky and called on an old childhood tradition as a star shot across the sky.</p><p>"I wish my dreams would come true for one time in my life." He drifted off to sleep as a single tiny particle of a spore drifted out from a hidden spot in his backpack and traveled to a spot on the ground, guided by starlight.</p><p>NEXT DAY</p><p>Ryoga launched at Ranma, his umbrella held high to block all of the falling rain. The redheaded Ranma-chan jumped over the bandana clad youth as he charged past and rebounded off a thick tree branch into the lost boys back casting his umbrella into the woods. He rolled to the ground under the protection of a huge oak, still entirely dry.</p><p>"A bit of good luck", smiled Ryoga, "I can still win this!"</p><p>Launching into the air while protecting the bulk of his body from the rain with his backpack, he plunged his fist deep into the tree Ranma had leaned against two seconds previously and shattered it into sawdust. Ranma-chan landed soundly beside him and unloaded a flurry of the umisen-ken white snake fist into his side and back. She smiled as Ryoga slumped to the ground, his clothes shredded and several noticeable red stab marks across his back and side. Ranma leaned against the tree and waited under the shelter of the tree until the rain stopped.</p><p>After dragging the unconscious Ryoga back to camp, well, technically he revived halfway but enjoyed not having to walk. After getting up and brushing the sticks and burrs out of his back Ryoga talked to Ranma about techniques and Ranma made several key points about why Ryoga would never get a girlfriend. Both stood dumbfounded, however at the sight that had been their campsite after a band of ten raccoons sifted through their food and made everything completely inedible.</p><p>"Dammit!" yelled Ranma, "why the hell didn't you bring the food with us!"</p><p>"I was going to!"  Screamed the lost boy hoarsely, all the anger that had been suppress resurfacing, "you threw hot scrambled eggs in my face and ran away!"</p><p>"We had to train and you would wake up!"</p><p>"So you threw molten poultry into face!"</p><p>"Stop squealing pig-boy!"</p><p>"Stop whining and help me find some foraging food you cross dresser!"</p><p>The characteristic red lightning bolts from any anime series flashed between their eyes before each had to blink away their seared eyelashes. As they tried to brush out the charred hair from the eyes, unsuccessfully because they were half blind from the soot, their eyes connected on a small mushroom growing on a high tree root. Both looked at each other and yelled the same word.</p><p>"DIBS!"</p><p>A redheaded girl and a hulking bandana clad guy smacked into each other as they wrapped around each other and pulled and bit and fought for the small portion of food. Ranma pushed her upper body back, brought up her legs and kicked Ryoga face first into the loose soil.</p><p>She kicked off his head, grabbed the mushroom and started to eat the small plant. Its flavor was odd for something that grew in a forest, kind of like a lollipop, or maybe some other kind of candy. Ryoga pulled his face from the dirt</p><p>"Goddammit Ranma" The obviously pissed off boy growled, "You couldn't have left me half?"</p><p>"Nope" smiled the re-energized redhead. That mushroom did wonders! Ranma had felt this energetic since Genma stopped at that brothel in China, "and it was so tasty. Mmm, to bad you couldn't have any. Hehehehe…" Ranma caught herself at the high pitched giggle that left her lips and looked on as the transformation began.</p><p>Ryoga picked himself up and watched as Ranma began to shrink, her pants and underwear started to drop off as her hips began to even out and grow smaller. Her chest shrank to be flat with her belly; her shirt grew several sizes too large and hung like a tent around her. She was shrinking several inches a second and her voice became much higher as she wailed about what was happening.</p><p>"NO!" the four year old redhead shrieked in a voice that was almost alien in the fact that it was so high, "Not again! Ryoga, is this where you found these damn mushrooms in the first place?"</p><p>"Hmm." Ryoga muttered, "Hard to tell, Chibi-Ranma, after awhile all forests begin to look the same…" Ryoga trailed off as he realized his position, he was in a deep-possibly hidden forest with his worst rival, who was now a child so young that a shirt that fit well on her old body now pooled at her feet. An accusing finger held hidden by the section of cloth with a face do comically exaggerated by her softened face that some people would find it adorable to see her make it.</p><p>A quick decision made up Ryouga's mind as he seized the small child by the sides and held her in front of him.</p><p>"Ranma, I have to thank you."</p><p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma, her feet dangling uselessly.</p><p>"Well, you brought me here, it was you who stole the mushroom from me, and your about to give me the chance to be as happy as I deserve." Ryoga abruptly dropped the squirming child, "run."</p><p>"What?" Ranma said as she stood up, a slight pain in her foot from the fall. Her blood ran cold as she saw the look on Ryouga's face.</p><p>"No-one will ever say I killed a defenseless opponent." he remarked with an eerie calm, his eyes turned to slits and his battle aura flared, "Run Ranma, you have ten seconds before I come for you."</p><p>Ranma stumbled backwards at the turn of events and fell flat on her ass. She stumbled over the cloth of her shirt as she ran into the cover of the forest. Trees broke behind Ranma as Ryoga shattered everything in his path in an attempt to crush his opponent. Ranma started to sob as she weaved between trees, trying not to trip over the now large tree roots or stab her exposed feet with any rocks.</p><p>She came to a clearing and tripped over her oversized shirt as she landed smack dab with her knee over a large sharp rock as she hit the ground. Pain ripped trough her leg as her joint dislocated, in her real form that bump would have been nothing. In this body she screamed in pain and frustration as her leg bent at an awkward angle.</p><p>Ryoga leaned over the tiny body of the biggest trouble in his life. He picked up the wailing child and made a quick walk to a steep incline that was almost a straight 90 degree angle. A thick canopy of trees sprawled out below and it was high enough that the fall would be fatal to a normal person; it would turn Ranma into a stain on the landscape. He lifted Ranma by the arm and held her over the edge.</p><p>"No please! Don't do this!" Ranma shrieked and cried like the little girl she was.</p><p>"It will be reported as an accident." He snickered loudly, "We were just training Akane, and we had set up for lunch. Ranma ate another of those weird mushrooms and he became a little kid and was so distressed at that fact that he stumbled backwards off the edge. sniffle he didn't survive the fall in a little kids body." His voice was so distraught that it seemed like he had prepared for this month ago.</p><p>"No…" tears streamed from her eyes as the lingering thought that Ryoga might be joking fled her mind, "please no…"</p><p>Any remaining pride was lost as Ranma screamed for any people she had ever felt at home with, Kasumi, Akane, and Nadoka were all called for and none answered. Ryouga's conscience flashed for a second, then was buried under the hatred he felt and the power of the opportunity. The last thing he heard was his own voice, a phrase he had said so much the words had almost lost all meaning.</p><p>"Die Ranma." His hand released and in almost slow motion he watched the twisted body of Ranma spiral through the air and disappear into a sea of green. He turned away from the sight and ran deep into the forest.</p><p style="text-align:center;">3 days later</p><p>Ranma's scream echoed through Ryouga's mind as he trudged through the forest and onto a road, a sigh pointer him to Nerima. A large sigh left his lips as he traveled in the opposite direction; he had destroyed his biggest enemy and ensured that his love would come to him with open arms. Why was he so depressed? The answer came to him in time, if there was a way to keep Ranma alive and still have Akane then he would have taken it. For all the times he had said the words he didn't want to be a murderer, especially not to someone as talented and hopeful as Ranma.  He sighed again and continued his long journey.</p><p>Ranma screamed as she awoke, high hoarse scream that scared all the other children in the room. She glanced at the room she was in; clowns and flowers decorated the walls. Stuffed animals and dolls were stacked in the corner and thin storybooks were piled in a short bookcase against the wall. Rows of small beds with yellow sheets covering them lined either wall and children stared at the distressed girl, either from beds or with the use of crutches or other support items. A small boy coughed lightly and a nurse who had been playing with some small girls walked to Ranma's beside.</p><p>"Did you have a nightmare, Chibi?" The nurse had a pleasant and patient face, looking more like a kind relative than anything else, "What's your name dear?"</p><p>"…" Ranma opened her mouth to speak but the sides of her throat were dry and swollen, "R-cough- Ran-cough"</p><p>"Oh dear." She muttered while producing a small flashlight from her coat pocket, "open wide." Ranma obeyed and had the nurse look into her throat.</p><p>"Öh my" the nurse said with a Kasumi-like quality, "your throat is swollen shut, I'll call for a doctor; but don't try and talk for a few days."</p><p>The nurse pulled the cover around Ranma's neck and held her hand on her forehead. Ranma felt safe here and closed her eyes.</p><p>Currently</p><p>Ryoga had been stumbling around the forest for days. His conscience wouldn't let him leave the forest and he eventually found his way to the spot where he had thrown Ranma off.</p><p>"Ranma, Akane." He whispered silently, than loudly, "What have I done, WHY?" His scream echoed through the trees and scared a flock of birds. He stared at the spot where Ranma had fallen. A tear came to his eye as he stepped off the ledge.</p><p>A river caught him as he fell and was denied even the cold embrace of death because he was to light to fall to the bottom. Ryoga squealed sadly as the river carried him away.</p><p>11/2 days later</p><p>Ranma had been picked up by two farmers when she floated by on the river and had been rushed to a regional hospital where she had slept for three days. Her knee was popped into place by a chiropractor that had an odd resemblance to doctor Tofu. She hobbled on a small crutch they had given her to take the weight off, but had been denied access to hot water because of her inability to speak.</p><p>Ranma still had the mind of an adult and was bored quickly with barely any real company. With a weakened imagination she couldn't have fun with dolls or stuffed animals. She had been quickly alienated because of her unwillingness to play or try to have fun with others. Ranma sighed quietly and held her throbbing throat, still couldn't talk.</p><p>Ranma's loneliness was disturbed by a girl that was about her current age. She shoved a one-eyed worn-out teddy bear with a neckerchief on into Ranma's hands.</p><p>"He's my favorite." She said grinning widely to show a missing front tooth, "he can keep you company for awhile." Ranma felt touched by the sincerity and innocence from this act, smiled widely back, and hugged the bear to her chest.</p><p>Back to Ryoga!</p><p>A small black pig washed up on a riverbank next to some farmland. Depressed because he had been denied even the comfort of the grave, he wandered next to a barn and contemplated joining the pigs in the barn to be slaughtered for his crimes.</p><p>"I hear the girls doing fine, Joe." A nearby ranch hand remarked, "you don't need to be havin' this mess up yur work. The doctor said we got her there in time."</p><p>"Still" mumbled Joe,"you got to wonder what kinda sicko would do that to someone so young."</p><p>"Relax man, for all we know it coulda been an accident."</p><p>Ryoga's heart raced as the thought that Ranma could have lived shot through his mind. He ran out of sight towards town and the recently dormant jealousy and hatred rose again, bringing more thoughts to his head. A plan was forming in Ryoga's mind, one that would ensure that Ranma both lived and made sure that he would not be the one that got Akane. Ryoga smiled as well as a pig can and continued his trot towards town and hot water.</p><p>2 days later</p><p>Ranma's ability to talk had gotten steadily better and had managed to set up a meeting with the head of staff. Ranma had made friends with several of the patients and had stopped the boys that were bugging the little girls for playing with dolls. Hard to taunt if your head has been pushed to your ankles isn't it? While not as strong as her adult form, Ranma was still the best fighter in the hospital, if lacking strength. Ranma had opted to not reveal her curse to everyone because she would still have to remain here for a while longer and would rather not spend that time being called a freak.</p><p>The kind nurse she had met a while ago led her down the hall so as not to get clipped by any passersby on her crutches. She led Ranma to the top floor and met with Dr. Boyle, the head of staff. He helped her in with a look of interest on his face and set Ranma into a raised chair.</p><p>"Well Chibi, as I can imagine you must have some questions." He spoke clearly and affluently but with a distinctive English accent, "But we all have questions, I hope you can answer mine, because I'm having a real hard time." He mocked wiping his brow and gave Ranma a hopeful look.</p><p>Ranma liked being talked down to and patronized about as much as pounding a red hot iron spike into her tongue. She however tried to humor him with a little giggle, knowing the little kids probably liked his little performances.</p><p>"Well" Started the elderly doctor, "my name is Doctor. Peter Boyle, what's your name Chibi?"</p><p>"Ranma Saotome desu." she answered full of pride at being able to finally tell her name, "Do you know how I got here?"</p><p>"I have a few more questions for you, now, do you live around here ran-chan?"</p><p>"No" Ranma answered coldly because the good doctor wouldn't answer her. No one paid any attention to the little kids she thought gloomily.</p><p>"Hmm, okay. Do you know your mommy or daddies first name?"</p><p>Ranma was getting more pissed by the second. Talking down to her was the worst/stupidest thing to do in this situation. Ranma sighed heavily and answered the question.</p><p>"My fathers name is Genma Saotome."</p><p>"Alright, do you remember why you were in the river? Did you trip? Did someone push you?"</p><p>Ranma held onto the edge of his desk so as not to scream out at the doctor. She calmed herself down and almost ripped the top off his desk as she thought back to Ryouga's face as he dropped her into the river where she blacked out.</p><p>"No! You listen to me for now!" She yelled; knock the started man into the back of his chair. "My name is Ranma; I live in Nerima, Tokyo in the Tendo dojo with my fiancée, her family, and my dad. I am actually 16 years old, and am a <u>guy</u>! Get some hot water and I'll prove that I am!"</p><p>The good doctor was flustered seeing a young child yell with such determination on such and unbelievable story. He regained composure.</p><p>"Okay Ranma, so how did this happen?"</p><p>"I fell in a cursed spring and turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and turn back into a guy when splashed with hot water. I ate a mystical aging mushroom and turned into a little kid, alright."</p><p>Seeing the little girl's determination he decided to humor her incredible story, "This is a lot to take in at once. I'll call your house and tell them where to find you, okay?"</p><p>"That will be fine."</p><p>Ranma hopped down from the chair as the nurse stuck her head through the door, holding a small box in her hands.</p><p>"I heard yelling. Are you done in here Chibi?"</p><p>"My name is Ranma" She remarked more cheerfully.</p><p>"Alright Ranma-chan, one of your little friends left today, but her mom left some of her clothes because you two were about the same size." She held up a small pair of pink overalls with a 'Hello Kitty' face sewn on the seat.</p><p>You could see the aura of coincidental irony hovering around Ranma. The nurse took Ranma's hand and walked her back to the children's ward. After they left Dr. Boyle did something he hadn't done since he treated that girl for acid burns, he reached into his desk and had a stiff belt of vodka.</p><p>"I interrupting anything?"</p><p>Dr. Boyle looked up from his drink. A boy wearing clothes that fit so badly it looked like he mugged a fat guy stood in the doorway.</p><p>"Not at all," The doctor chuckled, "my last appointment left a little early."</p><p>"Hmm, Ranko, it's a shame about her isn't it?"</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"My sister Ranko, it's a shame about her isn't it?"</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>"Uhh" Ryoga grunted, "has she been telling everyone that story again?"</p><p>"What story?"</p><p>"Ranko has some problems with her 'condition' she fell into a magic spring and turns into a boy when splashed with hot water."</p><p>"She actually found a magic spring?"</p><p>"Oh yeah, it's too bad."</p><p>"Yes… wait! Who the hell are you anyway?"</p><p>"As I said, I'm her brother, my name is Ranma Saotome</p><p>1 and ½ days later</p><p>Ranma's new clothes had replaced the hospital gown. Her new clothes however made it look like she would go prancing around a field picking flowers and playing with puppies. Apparently her old friend had been a fan of pink, yellow, and other pastels that Ranma's guy form wouldn't be caught dead in. Ranma however had gotten used to using crutches and found that acting cute and polite at this age pretty well guaranteed that she would either get more dessert at lunch, or would let her get away with breaking minor rules.</p><p>Again the nurse Ranma had grown to be fond of asked her to come with her. Ranma happily obliged, believing that this might be the day Akane and everyone would come to take her home. Ranma followed closely behind the nurse and noticed a fleeting look of discomfort on her face.</p><p>"Has Akane or Genma come yet?" Ranma asked hopefully.</p><p>"Somebody came, but I don't know his name."</p><p>Ranma was trying to make sense of the look on the nurse's face as she was lead to a door on the third floor.</p><p>"Try to go along with it." The nurse warned as she lifted the small girl into the room and held her ears to block out the crying and screaming.</p>
