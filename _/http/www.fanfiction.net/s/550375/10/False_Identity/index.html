</div>There is a reason for everything. This series is planned- not the<br/>minor details or anything, but there are so other tidbits that lead<br/>into each other.<p>For those of you who can guess who the redhead is... you get to be<br/>mentioned in my fic. If you got a website, that'll get mentioned too-<br/>and you can post False Identity on it, if you want.<p>You can find a picture of Ranma/Kitty here:<p>(it sucks, but then, it's not finished yet :P)<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Nine: Compromises<br/>Li Xiang<p>The sun beat down on them, drying their damp, nude bodies. The older<br/>boy was on his back, at the edge of the water, his soaking clothing<br/>drying on a rock beside him.<p>The younger boy lay on his stomach, back bared to the failing light of<br/>the sun, crimson lacerations decorating his skin from head to toe. The<br/>blood splatters from recently pulled scabs decorated his back in<br/>twisting, dappled patterns. His black hair fluttered around his face,<br/>an image of contented stillness.<p>The younger was purring, the older's fingers knit through his ebon<br/>hair.<p>The pale haired youth shook his head, removing his hand and standing.<br/>Stretching, Jei glanced at the molten orb setting over the trees. With<br/>a heavy sigh, he ambled over to his still rather wet clothing, casting<br/>a longing look back at the near by river. He and Kitty had spent the<br/>majority of the afternoon either in, or near the water.<p>Kitty slit an eye open, peering up at the pale form of his 'care<br/>giver'. The other boy had already tugged on his pants, and was<br/>attempting to shake out the water that remained in the cloth.<p>"We've gotta go back home," the amber eyed eleven year old picked up<br/>the clothing he'd bought for Kitty, "Time to get dressed."<p>-<p>Nagi hiked an eyebrow as Schuldich and Farfello only just barely<br/>managed to drag themselves into the kitchen, without falling asleep.<br/>The normally psychotic Irishman didn't even look aware of the knives<br/>on the counter, set out specifically so he could amuse himself. He<br/>almost passed out when he reached the table.<p>Schuldich was attempting to pour himself some coffee.<p>"What happened to you two?" Nagi was honestly curious- he'd seen<br/>those two come back from all-night missions, where they hadn't<br/>bothered to get sleep the day prior, and not look even an eighth as<br/>tired.<p>"They spent the night running around Tokyo with Saotome," the fifteen<br/>year old turned as Crawford entered the Kitchen, "They took out a<br/>number of Estet's targets for fun."<p>"Trying to sleep..." came Farfello's growl. He didn't bother to lift<br/>his head form where it rested on the table. Schuldich, now nursing his<br/>coffee, was sprawled on the ground in front of the coffee pot.<p>Crawford smirked, "I had to drag them both out of bed this morning."<p>-<p>Not as far away from Schwartz as they'd like, Omi and Yohji were being<br/>treated to the rather unusual- even for her- sight of Ranko sleeping<br/>through burning her hand on the stove filaments. Eyes shut, a light<br/>snore rumbling out of her open mouth, one hand on the still hot<br/>surface of the stove, the other on the counter. Ken stumbled into the<br/>kitchen a moment later, merely to gap in astonishment with the other<br/>two.<p>Yohji snapped out of it first, and darted to her side to shake the<br/>poor girl awake. Unfortunately, things didn't exactly turn out the way<br/>he thought they would.<p>Still asleep, Ranko's arm lifted from the stove to slam a fist into<br/>the older man's sternum. He gave a choked gasp, stumbling back, but<br/>the sleeping girl moved no further.<p>"I wonder what got her so tired."<p>Omi gave the long haired man an odd look, "What do you mean, Yohji?"<p>"_You_ weren't there when she tore into Ryouga or Tendou Akane, _then_<br/>_dragged_ me all over Tokyo, because we couldn't find a store selling<br/>Chinese clothing!"<p>"She was out most of the night," to the shock of the other boys, Aya<br/>trudged into the kitchen, half asleep, wearing nothing more than a<br/>pair of deep red boxers. From more than three feet away, the man<br/>appeared to be of smooth, white marble.<p>Closer, and it was possible to see the network of pale violet blade<br/>scars, and the stark, circular shape of long healed bullet wounds. It<br/>was something of Aya the rest of Weiss had never seen...<p>He just barely covered a yawn. Following that, as he passed Ranko, he<br/>smacked her upside the head.<p>She blinked her eyes open then stared around herself as though she<br/>didn't know where she was. It took a few seconds for her brain to<br/>start, but when it did, recognition washed across her face, "Morning."<p>"Ah... morning, Ranko," Omi smiled at her, but she merely responded<br/>with a slightly irritated look. She still didn't really want to talk<br/>to him.<p>"Hey, Ranko?" Ken cocked his head to one side, "What happened to your<br/>neck?" A couple of Band-Aids were stuck between the junction of neck<br/>and shoulder.<p>"It was bleeding."<p>"How do you get hurt there...?" Yohji smirked, "Or is it a hickie?"<p>It was Aya who responded, seeing as all Ranko was content with doing<br/>was giving the tall man a rather vicious death glare. It was the<br/>equivalent of 'I want to you burn in the farthest reaches of hell,<br/>before I dump you in Siberia to freeze to death'.<p>"It's a bite mark, Yohji. She returned last night with it still<br/>bleeding."<p>Ranko shot an unreadable look in Aya's direction. He hadn't mentioned<br/>it when she'd returned only a few short hours earlier, and she hadn't<br/>thought he'd noticed it. Shaking her head, she smirked, "Maybe you<br/>should get dressed, Aya."<p>The other redhead nodded, but only moved to sit at the table, and<br/>nurse a cup of coffee. Rank gave a snort of amusement, before<br/>attempting to riffle through the cupboards.<p>She fell asleep halfway through the second one.<p>-<p>The ever thoughtful Omi had given Ranko and Aya the day off. They<br/>spent a good four hours in Aya's room catching up on their sleep.<br/>After that- and Aya's failure to death glare Omi into letting them<br/>work, once the boy returned from school at noon- they finished<br/>cleaning out Ranko's new room. Now, at one in the afternoon, the two<br/>redheads lay in the room, staring at the ceiling.<p>"I'm bored."<p>Surprisingly, it was Aya who had announced this. Ranko mumbled an<br/>agreement, but did nothing more. Neither did Aya, for that matter. It<br/>was almost ten minutes later when Ranko rolled over to peer at Aya<br/>from the edge of the bed.<p>"Any idea of something to do?"<p>The violet eyed man had his fingers knit behind his head. He'd usually<br/>busy himself with work in the flower shop, or reading- but he'd made<br/>a vow to watch Ranko. If she was in contact with Schuldich, they had<br/>to be careful. He shook his head 'no', and Ranko slid off the bed<br/>until she was bent at the waist, pressing her forehead against the<br/>floor, "There's nothing to do? At all?"<p>With no answer, Ranko shoved herself fully off the bed and into a<br/>roll. Her legs smacked Aya across the chest, and he shot her an icy<br/>glare. An unrepentant smirk adorned her features.<p>"Get off me."<p>"Hmmm..." Ranko looked thoughtful for a second, as though she was<br/>actually considering it, "... no."<p>Aya let a smirk cross his face, and Ranko gave him a suspicious look.<br/>She hadn't really seen him smirk before: the normal stoic face, or the<br/>odd smile, or his dark scowl, but never a smirk, "I guess I'll just<br/>have to make you get off."<p>He shifted, lunging for her sides, remember her ticklishness from the<br/>day prior.<p>Ranko squirmed, batting at Aya's hands, but he didn't stop. In fact,<br/>he just tried harder; he hadn't had this much fun since Aya-chan was<br/>hospitalized. That sober his thoughts and actions for a second, and he<br/>paused.<p>In that moment of stillness, Ranko slammed her heel into his stomach.<br/>Aya froze, then his eyes narrowed, "This, he declared, all thoughts of<br/>his younger sister banished to the back of his mind, "means war."<p>With a quick shove, Aya had Ranko sprawled on her back, on the floor,<br/>and he was pushing himself to his feet. Blue eyes danced as Ranko<br/>grinned up at him, "You mean to take me one?"<p>She rolled into his legs, knocking him back to the ground, a smirk of<br/>triumph on her face. Bouncing up into a crouch, she lunged, pinning<br/>the dazed male to the ground. Aya hooked his leg around hers yanking<br/>her down on top of him.<p>She landed sprawled across his chest, but he ignored her position,<br/>instead twisting his wrists out of her loosened grasp, and throwing<br/>her off. The two redheads came to their feet on opposite sides of the<br/>room, hair and clothing mused, panting hard.<p>Omi chose that moment to throw open the door. In that split second,<br/>Ranko and Aya shared the same thought- thank god her hadn't arrived a<br/>moment earlier.<p>"Is everything alright in here?"<p>Ranko grinned, still breathing hard. Normally, she wouldn't have been<br/>this winded, not through such a short 'work out', but Aya had been<br/>tickling her. Aya just gave Omi an irritated look.<p>"Everything is fine, Tsukiyono. Peachy keen, and boring."<p>"It sounded, "Omi stressed the word, "like you two were fighting." An<br/>unlikely possibility, he knew- Aya seemed to like the other redhead<br/>and Ranko was usually only talking to him. Sometimes she and Ken would<br/>chat, but she avoided Yohji and himself like the plague.<p>"Oh, we were," the girl was still rather cheerful. Omi could have<br/>sworn Aya had snickered. Aya, in reality, trying rather hard not to<br/>laugh out loud at Omi's face. He took pity on the boy and explained.<p>"We were bored."<p>Alright, so it wasn't the greatest of explanations. Omi gave them both<br/>an incredulous look that swiftly darkened to annoyance.<p>-<p>Schuldich entered the coffee shop, lured by an unusual sulkiness come<br/>from a familiar mind. Aya was slouched in a chair, facing the door. He<br/>was swirling a spoon in an empty bowl and watching whoever was across<br/>from him. The jade-eyed assassin let his mind brush against the<br/>companion's, and blinked.<p>Either there were two minds of that unique mixture of animal and human<br/>or that was-<p>"Bishoujo, and Fujimiya!" Ranma spun to face Schuldich, and Aya<br/>focused a dark glare on the black assassin, "Are you two on a date?"<p>Aya's glare intensified, and Ranma made a face. Schuldich smirked in<br/>response - and that got him a spoonful of ice-cream in his face.<br/>Ranma stuck the spoon in her mouth again, grinning in triumph. Aya<br/>rolled his eyes at the display of childishness.<p>"For your information, Oh Guilty One," Aya had to snicker at Ranma's<br/>overly dramatic tone of voice, "We got kicked out of the Koneko by<br/>Tsukiyono."<p>Schuldich hiked an eyebrow. He would have just gone through Aya's mind<br/>to find out what was up, but he didn't really want to be on the<br/>receiving end of any of the Forbidden Techniques. Ranma was getting<br/>awfully protective of the swordsman- almost as much as he was of<br/>Farfello. The feeling came across, even through the confusing melee of<br/>human and feline thought patterns. Schuldich prided himself in<br/>understand them enough to get through Ranma's mind, relatively well.<p>"We got into a fight," the blue eyed redhead smirked, "and frightened<br/>some of the customers away."<p>"Why do I find that hard to believe?"<p>Ranma shrugged, sending the redhead a smug grin. Aya resisted the urge<br/>to repeatedly bang his head against the table. The girl he was<br/>supposed to be protecting from Schwartz was chatting amicably with one<br/>of their most dangerous members.<p>He was starting to get the feeling that Schwartz wasn't after her to<br/>kill her, as Omi and his contacted believed.<p>/If I were to kill her, Abyssian, Farfello would kill me./<p>He started, glowering at the telepathic redhead, before pausing. Ranko<br/>had him in a headlock- it looked really silly. The taller German held<br/>in place by a petite Japanese girl. Schuldich actually looked like he<br/>was struggling.<p>"Bishoujo!" he was laughing, but he also looked to be in pain. Aya let<br/>himself enjoy the sight for a few moments. He then turned to the girl,<br/>hiking an eyebrow.<p>Ranko let go, sinking back into her chair, "For your information,<br/>Schuldich, it was _not_ a 'lover's quarrel'. We were bored."<p>The jade-eyed man chuckled, shaking his head, "Damn, Kitty, do you<br/>always pick fights when bored?"<p>"Yes."<p>Both Aya and Schuldich looked at her in surprise. The fact that she<br/>had answered honestly wasn't it- she usually spoke her mind, without<br/>lying. It was the lazy smirk, and the fact that she didn't look<br/>disturbed by what she had just announced.<p>Aya frowned, She'd fight right into Schwartz.<p>/She's quite the actor, but she wouldn't fit in./<p>He cast the other man a sharp look, /What...?/<p>/She is a fighter, not a killer. He will kill./<p>Ranko frowned, "Are you two talking mentally? I feel left out."<p>Shucking off the confusion of the Schwartz assassin's statement, Aya<br/>turned his attention back to Ranko, "Let's go."<p>Ranko hopped to her feet, pushing Schuldich out of the way as she did<br/>so, "Where we goin' Aya?"<p>The man rose from his own seat, and shrugged. Ranko tapped her finger<br/>against her chin, a thoughtful look crossing her face. This was<br/>disrupted by Schuldich's arm draping across her shoulders.<p>"I know a place where we can go," he offered, "I won't even mind if<br/>you tag along, Fujimiya."<p>Aya shot him a glare that was close to the wort the violet eyed man<br/>had ever given Takatori Reiji. Schuldich shrugged it off, steering the<br/>girl out of the coffee shop. The Weiss boy followed, almost sulkily.<p>-<p>If it had been one redhead, it probably wouldn't have been noticed.<br/>The fact that there were three of them brought the attention to them.<p>Schuldich had dragged Ranko with him to where he had originally been<br/>destined, before "running into" her- one of the parks just on the<br/>edge of Juuban. Aya had trailed after the pair as though he was a<br/>chaperone for their date. He felt just as uncomfortable in this<br/>situation as he would then- although not because he was topped the<br/>"couple" from making out. He just felt like a third wheel.<p>This, of course, was quickly and efficiently remedied by Ranko. She'd<br/>shoved Schuldich in the park's man-made lake, grabbed Aya's arm and<br/>ran like a bat out of hell. It didn't take long for the flame haired<br/>man to catch up, what with his speed. He'd retaliated in kind, and<br/>when Aya had attempted to pull Ranko out of the water, shoved the<br/>other man in from behind.<p>After that, it turned into an all out water fight. They'd team up for<br/>a few moments to shove one or the other into the water, before turning<br/>on each other. The trio of soaking redheads- with Schuldich's mocking<br/>laughter, Ranko's rather decent impression of Kodachi, and Aya's<br/>whispery low chuckle- had the attention of ninety nine percent of<br/>everyone gathered within the park.<p>Not all that far away, watching with amusement clear in her jade eyes,<br/>was another redhead. She leaned against a thick, sturdy tree, with a<br/>wistful smile crossing her features for a second. And then it, just<br/>like the eighteen year old who'd borne it, vanished, as though neither<br/>had ever been. No one had truly noted her presence.<p>Ranko glanced in that direction, however. She got the fleeting<br/>impression that they'd just missed something important. Then Aya<br/>grabbed her ankle, Knocking her back into the water with a tremendous<br/>splash.<p>-<p>Still soaking wet, but now shivering instead of laughing, two of the<br/>three redheads trudged through the district. They were headed back<br/>towards the Koneko, where both currently lived. They were quiet as<br/>they moved- Ranko reflecting on the fun of the day; something that<br/>was ever so rare back when she'd lived in Nerima.<p>Aya, on the other hand, was trying to understand how he had _fun_ with<br/>one of his _enemies_. Not to mention how just being around Ranko made<br/>him act like Ran, for the first time in years. The girl confused him.<p>"Hey, Aya?"<p>"What?"<p>Ranko turned to face him, fingers knit behind her head, "You gonna<br/>tell your friends 'bout this afternoon?"<p>"Will you tell them?"<p>She blinked, then gave an awkward shrug, "I doubt they'd believe me."<p>Aya nodded at that- hell, he'd been the one participating, and he<br/>didn't believe it. He'd gone so far as to review all his thoughts,<br/>leading up to the afternoon, but could find no evidence of tampering.<br/>Schuldich hadn't forced him to do anything, directly. He restrained a<br/>sigh, and tilted his head back to look up at the sky.<p>"You confused?"<p>"Yeah," he said no more. He didn't want to explain himself. The way<br/>he'd acted today- the way _Schuldich_ had acted, for that matter- it<br/>contradicted his world. Ran could live without Aya-chan, he knew that<br/>now. Schwartz- or at least Schuldich- wasn't as bad as he'd<br/>believed. As krititer had lead him to believe.<p>This, he decided, needed to be thought upon.<p>-<p>"Well?"<p>Schuldich dropped himself into the chair, "You knew I'd run into them,<br/>if I went, didn't you?"<p>Crawford gave a quiet chuckled, and that was all the answer he needed.<br/>He might not be capable of reading his leader's mind, but he'd learned<br/>to read his actions. He was good at that.<p>Schuldich closed his eyes with a smirk. Fujimiya, even if he didn't<br/>realize it yet, was beginning to trust him. Quite the interesting<br/>development.<p>Crawford, too, was smirking. But his reasons were far more different.<p>-<p>Aya grit his teeth. Farfello stood outside the Koneko, amber eyes<br/>fixated on the wet redhead beside him. Just who he did not want to<br/>see.<p>"Jei-sama!" his companion, on the other hand, tore across the<br/>remaining distance in a flying tackle hug. Both men- Aya and<br/>Farfello- froze for a second in shock. Flying tackle hugs were far<br/>from commonplace here, not to mention ones aimed at Farfello.<p>The pale haired young man recovered first, coiling his own arms around<br/>Ranko's waist. He nuzzled her neck before releasing her, "Come play<br/>with me."<p>"Sure I just gotta-"<p>"Not tonight," Aya's growl cut through Ranko's mental "fog", and Jei's<br/>lips curled back in a snarl. Aya did not back down from the looks he<br/>was receiving, "You're not going anywhere tonight."<p>"Who says?" Jei's hands landed possessively on Ranko's shoulders,<br/>"Kitty's mine!"<p>The violet eyed assassin bit his tongue from lashing out. First,<br/>because they did not need a fight out here, to scare off the<br/>customers. And second, because he knew damn well why Ranko would not<br/>talk to Omi, and cursed Yohji out to anyone who'd listen. Instead, he<br/>stalked up to the other man, "Don't you have a mission tonight,<br/>Schwartz?"<p>Schuldich had accidentally let it slip that Schwartz had a mission<br/>that night. It was his reason for stopping the water fight in the<br/>first place. Farfello should have known that.<p>It was Aya's turn to be faced with the look that was quickly being<br/>dubbed the "Creepy Pout" by Ranma, "Kitty will be coming with me,<br/>Weiss."<p>The girl in question sighed, throwing up her hands, "Jei-sama wants me<br/>to go, Aya doesn't, and Schuldich has socked me to the bone. Decide,<br/>or I beat the ever living shit out of _BOTH_ of you."<p>They gave her startled looks. Especially Jei- his Kitty would<br/>actually try to hurt him? What was Weiss doing to him? Aya frowned,<br/>and gave Farfello a dark glare.<p>"She stays here. I won't send her on any of Weiss' missions, you don't<br/>send her on any of Schwartz. Deal?"<p>Jei looked like he wanted to object, but an evil little smile crossed<br/>his face, "Deal. _She_ does not do missions, at all. _He_ will work<br/>for Schwartz."<p>Aya blinked. That was the second time. What did they mean, Ranko<br/>'she', and Ranko 'he'? There was only one Ranko!<p>Said Ranko was grinning widely. Although she couldn't fight alongside<br/>her Jei-sama, Ranma could. He'd be ready to go in-<p>She sneezed.<p>Okay, so he wouldn't be fighting, tonight. She rubbed her nose, and<br/>sneezed again. Ranko turned to pout at Aya. Jei was treated to the<br/>surprising sight of Aya capitulating to Ranko's unspoken wishes. They<br/>disappeared into the shop.<p>How... interesting.<p>End
