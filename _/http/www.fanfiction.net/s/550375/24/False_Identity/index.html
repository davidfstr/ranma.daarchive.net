</div>Yes, Chapter Twenty-three is the epilogue. False Identity is over.<p>Of course, this paves the way for True Identity, the sequel. Be amazed<br/>by my abilities to continue something on whether people want it or not!<br/>(I'm hoping people will want it... *grins* People like Green-chan.<br/>Hiiii! *waves madly*)<p>And, just to make sure everyone is nice and happy and whatnot, the<br/>prologue for True Identity is being put up at the same time! XD Yes<br/>indeed, the prologue will be up and nice and stuff. I'm soooo cool.<br/>*sticks her tongue out at everyone who says she's not*<p>I hope you guys had as much fun reading this as I did writting it,<br/>and...<p>GIMME FANART! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br/>(me email is , for those at  who don't want to<br/>have to go back to my profile to get it. Lazy bastards.)<p>False Identity<br/>Epilogue: Endings<br/>Li Xiang<p>It was all over the news. The police had tried to keep it covered up,<br/>but with the way things run, it couldn't stay that way. They'd said it<br/>was a random act of violence, at first.<p>Then came the knowledge of the prior attacks, and it became<br/>premeditated murder. No one in Nerima was willing to put their neck<br/>out, they weren't stupid. They didn't want to end up dead, although<br/>everyone in the district knew exactly who had done the attack.<p>They figured that he'd finally snapped under the pressure. And if he<br/>had, none of them wanted to be on his bad side. Not with Nabiki's<br/>obvious limp, and Kunou's cast encased arm. Not with Akane and Xian Phu<br/>both in comas in the hospital. Not with Muu Tzu and Khu Lon as cooled<br/>corpses. They were smart. They weren't going to rile Saotome Ranma by<br/>telling the police that he was the attacker.<p>But the police were smart. They connected Ranma to the murders and<br/>attacks quickly and efficiently. It didn't matter, though. What they<br/>learned made many a man stare up at his ceiling at night, shaking under<br/>the covers of his bed, or seeking comfort in his wife's embrace. Ranma<br/>was a man to be feared- he could vanish into thin air, even with one<br/>looking directly at him, the son of a wanted master thief.<p>So the media never learned who had attacked and killed the Amazon boy,<br/>and elder. Any member of the media who did learn, soon forgot, care of<br/>a single bottle of formula 119 shampoo.<p>After all, Xian Phu, Khu Lon and Muu Tzu weren't the only nyucheuzu in<br/>Tokyo.<p>-<p>It had been two weeks since that beautiful night of bloodshed.<p>Their lives had calmed down, Schwartz and Weiss going off on missions<br/>as they were want to do, testing new and improved ways to kill each<br/>other- as taught by the two Saotomes- and ultimately doing little<br/>damage to each other and lots of damage to their targets, and their<br/>target's bodyguards.<p>Rache got a workout in healing the times they did get hurt- to the<br/>point where she got stronger with her powers, and started yelling at<br/>anyone who came to her to heal a scratch, even if it _was_ from Aya's<br/>sword, or Farfello's knives.<p>Of course, over the course of those two weeks, Schuldich, Farfello and<br/>Ranma spent the majority of their time trying to convince Crawford that<br/>leaving Estet was a good idea- on that, he agreed, it was the _other_<br/>point that put him off. The one that would have Schwartz and Weiss both<br/>disappear from the world market for hired men, and for them to end up<br/>living together.<p>There were also the terms of the agreement, that Crawford was a bit<br/>leery of. They were essentially stating that Schwartz would become<br/>defunct as a unit. That they'd have to find new jobs, a new way of<br/>living. The American didn't want to give up his lifestyle. He _liked_<br/>his lifestyle.<p>Schuldich had finally been able to convince Crawford to "just go to the<br/>damned warehouse and talk about the terms with Weiss". He'd said that<br/>they weren't going there to agree and be happy about it- they were<br/>going to argue for favorable terms on both sides, and eventually come<br/>to an agreement.<p>"Nice place," Crawford drawled dryly, shooting his teammates a dark<br/>look. The warehouse looked run down, and out of sorts, in the midday<br/>light. An eyesore. Ranma just grinned widely, throwing the doors open<br/>and bowing comically, the European way, to Bradley.<p>"The inside is much better, I assure you," the blue eyed teen teased<br/>happily, slipping in beside Farfello once the others had gotten in. Jei<br/>tugged Ranma to him by the sleeve, but the martial artist merely<br/>grinned widely, wriggling out of the grip and darting off to inform the<br/>others that Schwartz had arrived.<p>While his mother and Kojiro were, indeed, in the circle of people who'd<br/>congregated in the "main room"- otherwise known as the room with a lot<br/>of computer screens and teribi for one wall- neither were planning on<br/>moving into the warehouse. They'd only come to work as peacemakers<br/>between the two enemy groups should tensions arise. They didn't need<br/>someone trying to kill someone else in the middle of "negotiations".<p>By the time supper had rolled around, though, the only thing both<br/>groups had agreed to was leaving their respective "companies".<br/>Tensions, as expected, had risen, although the groups that had been<br/>separated into had not been expected. Farfello and Ranma, of course,<br/>had been part of one group, with the inclusion of both Aya and,<br/>surprisingly, Yohji. Crawford, Nagi, Ken and Omi made another group,<br/>with Schuldich, and Rache in the final group. Nodoka and Kojiro were<br/>actually backing the two Germans, while attempting to stay neutral.<p>They weren't going to have to live with them, after all.<p>Crawford's group was willing to leave Estet and Kritiker, but not to<br/>move in together. Schuldich and Rache wanted the two groups to both<br/>leave, and to move in together. While Ranma's party was willing for the<br/>two groups to move into the warehouse, they didn't want to leave<br/>Kritiker or Estet. After all, Kritiker had been employing the Fujimiya<br/>family for years, and Yohji had been given another chance by Kritiker<br/>after Asuka's[1] death. Farfello felt the tiniest bit of loyalty to the<br/>men that had ordered his "release" from the mental institution in<br/>Dublin, while Ranma would side with whatever his Jei-sama thought.<p>It was a touchy subject, the agreement, and it seemed like it was about<br/>to pull one of the most annoying tricks in all history.<p>Bicker and argue, and not do a damn thing for all eternity.<p>They broke for dinner, the groups dissipating to find something to eat<br/>while they worked the problems over. Well, Crawford's group, Aya,<br/>Yohji, and Rache were going to think it over. Farfello, Ranma, and<br/>Schuldich were just going to look for something fun to do. Nodoka had<br/>forbidden her son to cause any bloodshed, however, so that limited<br/>their "fun" down to non-lethal, non-violent means.<p>Ranma wasn't about to disobey his mother. She was to important to him.<p>The two gaijins and their martial artist companion prowled the streets,<br/>picking up a bite to eat at some random Okinomiyaki-ya- Ranma's<br/>comment of "it's not as good as Ucchan's", setting the owner into a fit<br/>of rage. The three young men had laughed as they walked away from the<br/>suddenly cowering owner. Watching Farfello stab his own tongue, while<br/>sticking it out and letting the blood drip off could do that to anyone.<p>"How long til we hafta be back?"<p>Schuldich shrugged, grinning wolfishly at a passing woman with long,<br/>greenish-black hair, "About an hour or so. They can probably start<br/>without us, Bishoujo."<p>"They probably will," Ranma grinned, hooking his arm through Jei's. The<br/>one-eyed assassin glared dangerously at those who watched them with<br/>open disgust on their faces. Ranma tried to ignore the few stares he<br/>got, but couldn't help blush bright red. Or look around nervously for<br/>the sight of Mallet-sama, which wasn't about to show up. After all,<br/>Akane was in a coma.<p>/Programmed reaction, eh Bishoujo?/ Schuldich grinned at the dirty look<br/>he got in response. Flaunting mental powers to those who did not have<br/>them was actually kinda fun. Although, it was usually only Rache and<br/>Ranma who got angry over it. Everyone else was either wary of him, or<br/>scared shitless. That was fun, too, scaring people. Heh.<p>"We have any idea of what we gunna do?" Ranma continued, still glaring<br/>at Schuldich. Farfello grinned widely.<p>"Hurt God!" He was, of course, pointing to a long flight of stairs, and<br/>the shrine atop it. What a way to hurt god- desecrate a shrine to him!<br/>Schuldich rolled his eyes, and Ranma grinned wryly, but the two fell<br/>into step as Jei bounded cheerfully up the stairs.<p>"Yes?" a shrine maiden peered at them, violet eyes shadowed by long<br/>black hair. She was scowling at them, "Is there something I can do for<br/>you?"<p>Schuldich had frozen upon seeing the woman, and afterwards, Ranma had<br/>sworn up and down that Schuldich had flared a fairly large battle aura.<br/>The two sadomasochists backed away from the German, glancing at each<br/>other. With an abrupt nod, they each grabbed one of Schuldich's arms<br/>and dragged him away from the temple. As much fun as it would be to see<br/>Schuldich kill the girl, they were nervous for a very good reason.<p>The only time they'd ever seen him this angry was when some blonde<br/>cross-dressing chick had been cussing out Rache. Schuldich had put her<br/>in the hospital, surprisingly not killing the girl, but had destroyed a<br/>fairly large area of the Juuban District in doing so. He hadn't<br/>recognized either of his friends- not even Rache, his own sister!-<br/>when he'd finished, and it had only been by using a fairly high powered<br/>Mouko Takabisha that had knocked the man out of his lunatic rage.<p>Ranma and Rache had spoken to each other about it, wondering if maybe<br/>the man had been rooting around in Farfello's mind to much. Or maybe<br/>that when he was skimming Ranma's cat-mind, he'd picked up a few of the<br/>nastier Nekoken traits. They hadn't figured it out yet, only knew that<br/>Schuldich with a battle aura pretty much meant an outta control guy,<br/>with no way to shut him down.<p>So they dragged Schuldich away, in fear of getting themselves killed if<br/>they weren't fast enough. Hey, a little pain and a little blood was<br/>alright. They didn't want to be _dead_ though. They liked being alive.<br/>If only to cause a little mayhem and to hurt god even more.<p>"What was _that_ all about?" Ranma asked when the redhead had finally<br/>calmed down enough to talk. Schuldich was slouched in the chair at the<br/>small cafe they'd ducked into.<p>Schuldich sighed, "That was one of Rache's old "friends"."<p>"You mean those bitches that ditched her for no good reason?" Ranma<br/>growled. Rache was a friend. Jei's eye narrowed, and the mere glint of<br/>cruel intelligence darting through the amber iris only meant one thing.<br/>Farfello's sadistic, sane, side was in control.<p>"If you loose control like that again, Schuldich, we can't let you get<br/>near her. However, Kitty and I..."<p>"I like the way you think, Jei-sama."<p>"Of course you do," Schuldich grinned, then sighed, "Ah, don't worry<br/>about it. I want to leave those girls alive so that when kleine<br/>schwester goes after them, they know _true_ fear. Kind of like what<br/>went on with Raven and the living corpse."<p>Both nodded. They could understand that. After a few moments, Ranma<br/>sighed, "C'mon, we'd better get going. They'll start the meeting<br/>without us, and we won't even get a voice in for what we want."<p>"It's not like you two are doing anything but be annoying," Schuldich<br/>snorted, "You change your vote every time it looks like we're about to<br/>come to a decision, just to keep us from deciding."<p>The ebon haired teenager's eyes sparkled, "Yeah, well, money is a<br/>lovely deciding factor."<p>"Money?"<p>"Said to much, Kitty," Farfello snickered, climbing to his feet, before<br/>he and his Kitty ran off, laughing as Schuldich chased them back<br/>towards the warehouse.<p>"Money? What money? Hey! You're being _paid_ to fuck this up?"<p>End<p>[1] Is it Asuka? I can't remember...<p>Well, False Identity has come to an end. I was hoping to make it<br/>longer, but the ideas for how to run this without starting into the<br/>True Identity plot just ran out. So, here's the epilogue and the<br/>lead-in to True Identity. Want to know what Rache does to her<br/>ex-friends? Can't figure out the blatantly obvious clues to who the<br/>cross-dressing blonde chick is, the girl with singers following her<br/>around, or the black haired shrine maiden?<p>Then you'll just have to wait for True Identity, wherein the girl named<br/>revenge gets her revenge. Whoo! Go Rache!<p>And there's no doubt about it. Ranma will be a major influence- and we<br/>can't forget Schuldich or Farfello. Aya's in there too. Maybe the<br/>others will make an appearance or ten. Who knows...? *grins widely*<br/>Okay, yes, I _do_ know, but am I going to tell you? Nope! I'm not<br/>ruining it!<p>Until Next Time,<br/>Sammi "Li Xiang" Leigh
