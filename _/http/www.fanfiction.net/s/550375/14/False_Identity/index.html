</div>You lucky people, you! It's 3:00, friday afternoon. I've just spent the<br/>last fourty-five minutes going over the chapter, fixing all those<br/>lovely problems my pre-reader found. And, since it's done before<br/>nightfall, that means that the teaser isn't going to be used.<p>Yes, I was going to put up a teaser, instead of the next chapter,<br/>considering neither my pre-reader nor I thought that it would be ready<br/>for this week. But, halleluah! It's been finished. Aren't we a bunch of<br/>happy readers? Happy readers that will send Li Xiang money, not for the<br/>fic, but for Li Xiang's rather large anime addiction. So that those<br/>fansubs awaiting Li Xiang's hands, can actually get there...<p>Sorry, I watched an episode and a half of Saiyuki, and now I want it.<p>In other news, I've done it again! For those of you who've known me for<br/>awhile, know that I used to have a comic entitled "Oni". It didn't get<br/>very far. This time, however, I _will_ update my new comic, "Legions".<br/>Legions updates every monday with a new comic, at<br/>.com/airrydragon/ for those of you who want to<br/>check it out.<p>Oh, and _Krypt_? Wrong Kunou. Think his dad.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Thirteen: Nerima<br/>Li Xiang<p>It was when they entered Reiji's limo- Crawford and Ranma had been<br/>"chosen" to be the "bodyguards" in the car with the two older men-<br/>that it happened. Pauline had been quiet when Crawford was chosen,<br/>although he was the one to suggest Ranma. Reiji had trusted his long<br/>time friend's decision.<p>Ranma had expected it. How could he not? He'd spent two years in the<br/>man's school, he knew the Kunou family was insane. Therefore, he caught<br/>Pauline's wrist, and tapped a shiatsu point Doctor Tofuu had used on<br/>him a few times in the past. The sheers fell to the floor of the limo.<p>Despite not knowing the boy's true motives for working with his<br/>"bodyguards", Reiji had to smirk. The boy was good. He didn't even<br/>flinch when Pauline lunged at him- he'd seen trained military<br/>officers, people who had been trained to be able to look down the<br/>barrel of a fully loaded semi-automatic machine gun and smirk, flinch<br/>when confronted by Pauline and his razor sharp sheers.<p>Their friendship had survived, mostly because Pauline had no desire to<br/>take Reiji's job. Really, all he wanted from Reiji was money to fly to<br/>Hawaii, and money to spend in Hawaii. Not to mention someone to<br/>complain about Kodachi and Tatewaki to.<p>"My hair," came Ranma's sneer, "if off limits, Kunou. You should know<br/>that by now."<p>The older man did something ever so mature. He stuck out his tongue.<br/>Ranma blinked, not having to expected a full grown man to stick out his<br/>tongue. While normally the ebon haired teenager would respond by<br/>sticking out his tongue, it just seemed strange to see it from an<br/>adult.<p>Even if it was a Kunou.<p>Crawford raised an eyebrow, and did not comment. Somehow, just somehow,<br/>he couldn't understand _why_ Reiji would be friends with an inept moron<br/>who acted like a child.<p>Pauline pulled his tongue in with a scowl in Ranma's direction, from<br/>the lack of response, as well as the look he was getting from Crawford.<br/>He had never personally met the man until that day, but Reiji had<br/>spoken of Schwartz when he had first hired them. Crawford was just as<br/>Reiji had described- dignified and calculating. He may act like a<br/>psychotic hair-obsessed idiot, but even he could see the cold gleam in<br/>Crawford's eyes behind his glasses. At least in those rare moments of<br/>ludicity; those happened almost once a year, now that he was taking his<br/>medicines.<p>As he turned his gaze back to "his" student, Pauline felt a chill go<br/>down his spine. Despite _looking_ normal, there was almost a feral<br/>quality about him. Ranma's eyes glinted almost malevolently, even if<br/>his face was blanked. Not even that infuriating smirk was on his face.<p>The moment passed, and Pauline lunged for the sheers, only to be<br/>slammed into the left door of the limo. Ranma dropped his leg from the<br/>kick. Again, the man snatched up his scissors, and charged at Ranma;<br/>and considering that they were in a car at that moment, Ranma had<br/>little room to maneuver. Another kick, with a punch thrown in, just for<br/>fun, Pauline found himself making friends with the door, again.<p>Reiji scowled, "Don't fight in here."<p>Ranma's voice was monotone again, "Of course, Sir."<p>Pauline whimpered, crawling back into his seat, "But Reiji-kun..."[1]<p>"No," Reiji turned a piercing glare on his friend, and the Kunou<br/>Patriarch wilted. He always had, ever since they were kids. Reiji could<br/>be _Scary_ when he wanted to be. Pauline gave a puppy-like whine, then<br/>settled into his seat with a pout. Already, ideas of how to relieve<br/>Ranma of his pigtail raced around inside his head.<p>Ranma, Crawford and Reiji ignored Kunou's mad giggling, from long<br/>practice- Crawford form Farfello, Reiji from Pauline himself, and<br/>Ranma from dealing with Kodachi.<p>The drive to Nerima and the Kunou mansion was boring, in Ranma's view.<br/>After Reiji had forbidden Pauline and Ranma from fighting, they'd<br/>settled into a staring contest, glowering at each other. Even when<br/>Pauline was chatting with Reiji, he watched Ranma out of the corner of<br/>his eye.<p>The limo, as well as the black car the rest of Schwartz was in, pulled<br/>into the Kunou driveway, under the gaze of one Kunou Kodachi. The<br/>gymnast sighed; it looked like her father was home. That thought<br/>changed instantly, when some man she didn't know, came out of the car,<br/>followed by her Ranma-sama.<p>"My love," Kodachi whispered to the window, "You have finally come for<br/>me!"<p>Her state of bliss was abruptly shattered by a man she'd seen in<br/>pictures- Takatori Reiji- and her father exited the limo. It came<br/>back just as quickly, as she decided that Ranma must have endured her<br/>father's madness to ask for her hand in marriage. She laughed.<p>"!"<p>An involuntary shiver ran down Ranma's back, and his head snapped up at<br/>the laugh, even as he tripped Pauline. The man- and his sheers- hit<br/>the ground, "Oh great, the Psycho's home."<p>/The one who's broadcasting disgusting fantasies of you, Bishoujo?/<p>/That's the one/ "Jei-sama?" Ranma turned to his master, "Whatever<br/>Kodachi says, don't believe it. She's out of her mind."<p>"Oh?" Schwartz and Ranma had fallen into step behind the two rich men.<br/>Farfello's hand lay possessively on Ranma's shoulder.<p>"She's tried to force herself on me, before," the ebony haired boy<br/>sounded vaguely disgusted, as they passed the threshold, and entered<br/>the Kunou mansion.<p>Jei was just barely able to yank Ranma to him, as the larger form of<br/>the principal of Furinkan high whirled, sheers in hand. The man skidded<br/>to a stop, his target having moved, "Da big Kahuna refuses to 'llow<br/>long-hair in his home. You be getting a hair-cut!"<p>Schuldich's hand went to his own, flame toned locks, and his eyes<br/>narrowed into slits. Like hell he'd let this man touch his hair. Ranma<br/>had similar thoughts as he shot forwards to relieve Pauline of the<br/>sheers in his hand. The older man grinned madly, lunging at his "prey".<p>Farfello snarled as he watched, but he held back. If Ranma was really<br/>serious, the Saotome Family honour blade would be out. Ranma was<br/>playing a game of... "Cat and Mouse", with Pauline. Of course, someone<br/>_else_ didn't see it that way.<p>"Ranma-sama!"<p>The ribbon cracked the air, and Kodachi pulled the sheers from her<br/>father's hand. The Black Rose swept forwards, visions of her Ranma-sama<br/>dropping to his knees before her beauty and proposing to her flooded<br/>her mind.<p>Farfello's snarl turned into an outright bestial growl. Ranma heard the<br/>growl, and turned his attention back to where, Farfello believed, it<br/>belonged: on him.<p>"Jei-sama!" Kitty was by his master's side in a mere moment, "You<br/>remember what I said, Jei-sama?"<p>"Jei...sama?" Kodachi shrieked, dropping both ribbon and sheers-<br/>Pauline lunged for them, and turned to face Schuldich. Kodachi grabbed<br/>Ranma about the neck with a wail, "What is this about, Ranma-sama?"<p>"Get off him," Farfello was growling again, single amber eye flashing<br/>darkly. The Irishman forcefully pried the girl off _his_ property,<br/>throwing her to the ground, and wrapping himself around Ranma. The boy<br/>looked a mixture of confusion and relief. Confusion, due to not<br/>understanding _exactly_ what was going on between Farfello and Kodachi,<br/>and relief for having Kodachi knocked off of him.<p>"Are you done yet?" Nagi stood at the far end of the hall, "Reiji-sama<br/>is getting annoyed Jiro."<p>Pauline blinked a few times. It had been a long time since anyone other<br/>than Reiji had called him 'Jiro', considering that it was his birth<br/>name. With a bit of a shrug, he dropped the sheers again. He kept<br/>wondering where the sharp pain in his skull was coming from; they<br/>always vanished once he let go of the sheers... and backed away from<br/>Schuldich, "I guess you don't _have_ to get a hair cut, _right_ now..."<p>Schuldich smirked, and padded further into the mansion behind its<br/>owner. Still standing in the front entrance, Jei _glared_ at Kodachi,<br/>before leading his Kitty into the home with an almost gleeful grin.<p>Kodachi fumed where she sat, before bouncing to her feet. Whoever this<br/>one-eyed peasant was, there was no _way_ she'd let _him_ steal _her_<br/>Ranma-sama!<p>The thing was, Jei was thinking along those very same lines.<p>-<p>Ranma stood, much as he had over the past few hours, with a nervous<br/>look on his face. Jei and Kodachi had been glaring at one another, or<br/>staring at him, since they'd entered. Kodachi's craze, lusting gaze was<br/>a familiar weight that Ranma could ignore easily. However, Farfello's<br/>almost... predatory stare was new. Then again, Ranma had only been<br/>around his Jei-sama for a few short days.<p>In addition, he was bored. Reiji and Pauline were drunk off their<br/>asses; Nagi was using his power to make various sculptures dance in<br/>circles; Schuldich was asleep; and Crawford had vanished somewhere a<br/>good hour and a half earlier.<p>"If you're that bored," okay, so maybe Schuldich _wasn't_ asleep, "Do<br/>that martial arts thing of yours."<p>Kodachi was nearly drooling at the though- Ranma-sama, bare chested<br/>and sweat drenched, working out in her home... The fantasy had begun to<br/>twist into a seriously deranged sex fantasy when Schuldich intervened.<br/>Any telepath in _Japan_ could have seen her fantasy; she was<br/>broadcasting so strongly.<p>While he _love_ to test out some of the more... kinky situations, on a<br/>certain nineteen-year-old brunette, others were too much, even for him.<p>The telepath ruthlessly gave her a glimpse of a full-blown migraine,<br/>for a good minute and a half. Kodachi whimpered, and Schuldich dropped<br/>out of her mind with a smirk.<p>She bounced to her feet, Ranma and Jei already moving out of the room.<br/>A nasty little smirk crossed her features. She'd lead Ranma-sama to<br/>their dojo- he'd be grateful, banish the white-haired bodyguard, and<br/>they'd make beautiful passionate love.<p>Giggling madly, the gymnast darted in front of her love, "Ranma-sama!<br/>I'll show you to the dojo!"<p>Farfello growled, curling his fingers in the back of Ranma's shirt. The<br/>younger man nodded, and the gymnast latched herself to Ranma's side.<br/>Her hand came up, waving the Irishman off, "Begone, peasant!"<p>It was Ranma himself that grabbed her wrist, "You _ever_ call Jei-sama<br/>a 'peasant' again, and I _won't_ hesitate to kill you. Is that<br/>understood?"<p>"Ranma-sama..." Kodachi was divided on what to do. On one hand, this<br/>peasant had obviously brainwashed her Ranma-sama into believing he was<br/>less than the gaijin trash. On the other, her Ranma-sama had threatened<br/>her. Her! His one true love!<p>She glared at the evil Jei again. He was at fault, as much as that<br/>whore Tendou Akane, for keeping Ranma-sama away from her. The gaijin<br/>looked down at her, his single eye radiating a sense of smugness, and<br/>contempt, as they moved through the mansion, towards the training<br/>room/dojo.<p>"Oh! Ranma-sama, Tatchi may be practicing inside..."<p>"Good," Ranma _purred_. Kodachi looked a bit surprised- she'd never<br/>heard Ranma _purr_ before- and Jei was the picture of a hyperactive<br/>six-year-old standing at the gates to Disney land. He was almost<br/>_bouncing_ in place as Ranma continued, "I need to work off some<br/>stress."<p>The door swung inwards when Kodachi touched it. Within stood Kunou<br/>Tatewaki, in all his "glory". The bokoutou arced through the air, the<br/>young kendo student running through his forms. The fading sunlight<br/>spilled through the window, giving the room and almost daydream<br/>quality.<p>"Abyssian's better."<p>One had to wonder if they practiced that. Ranma and Jei had spoken as<br/>one, their voices ringing out through the training hall. Kunou froze.<br/>He turned, slowly, to the door.<p>"Knave! How dare you enter these holy grounds, demon! Your mere<br/>presence defiles my home, sorcerer! Begone!"<p>"Does he always talk like this, Kitty?"<p>Ranma snorted, "Sometimes, the moron is worse."<p>"You dare?" Kunou roared, "You dare to speak ill of mineself? Have at<br/>thee!" The kendoist lunged at Ranma, swinging the wooden blade,<br/>screaming his "war cry"- "RATATATATATATATATATATA!"<p>The martial artist dodged lazily, hands in his pockets. As Kunou<br/>overextended, Ranma leaned back. His leg snapped up, cracking loudly<br/>against Kunou's elbow. He screamed in pain, as the joint was forcibly<br/>reversed, the bokoutou slipping from nerveless fingers.<p>"Asshole!" Kodachi, Jei and Ranma blinked. With the way Kunou normally<br/>talked, they hadn't expected this. Nor his next words, "You goddamned<br/>_whore_! You broke my arm, you fuckin' LUNATIC!"<p>Even more shocking was the fact that Kunou's eyes did not hold the<br/>glaze of obsession that had been there so long, even _Pauline_ couldn't<br/>remember a time when it wasn't there. Kunou had never had such a<br/>serious injury, however, and apparently, it was enough pain, that it<br/>loosed him from his insanity. At least, temporarily.<p>"Asshole," Kunou repeated, using his good arm to push himself to his<br/>feet. His teeth were grit in pain, but a dark grin lit his lips,<br/>"You're a fool," he sneered, "A fool bound to evil."<p>He stood tall, the glaze still gone from his eyes. In its place was<br/>pain, but still a hell of arrogance, "You're a low-borne crass fool.<br/>You'll never be anything more. Following your father like a dog on a<br/>leash, unable to think for himself," a mad chuckle distorted by pain<br/>worked itself from his lips, the veneer of insanity crawling across his<br/>eyes again, "You are _nothing_ Saotome. You will _never_ be anything<br/>more than nothing. A toy, made for his superiors- such as I!"[2]<p>Kunou would have continued his rant, but he was interrupted- he found<br/>himself slammed through the wall, legs twitching. Jei stood where Kunou<br/>had, panting and snarling. Ranma jumped forwards, catching Jei's<br/>shoulder, just as Reiji and Pauline burst in to see what the ruckus was<br/>about.<p>"...the hell?" that, was Reiji.<p>"Youse little punks! You put my Tatchi through the wall! Get out! OUT<br/>OF MY HOUSE!" and that, would be Pauline. The Kunou Patriarch was a<br/>little more than pissed off.<p>Mostly over the fact that he'd have to delay that next trip to Hawaii<br/>to pay for the damages done to his house.<p>-<p>Ranma kicked a stray can into the air, scowling into the early night,<br/>the sun having set only an hour and a half earlier, "_Now_ what do we<br/>do?"<p>Jei shrugged, "We could hunt."<p>"No we can't," the martial artist grumbled, glaring at the ground,<br/>"Damn near everyone in this district is a martial artist."<p>"Really?" Jei draped an arm over Kitty's shoulders, dragging the boy<br/>close enough that he could play with the metal name tag at Ranma's<br/>throat. His pet nodded, and Jei frowned, "If you can't hunt here...<br/>what do you do?"<p>"I'm Xue Shi, Jei-sama. I usually went to Juuban and did a few<br/>performances," the ebony haired boy made a face, "Akira threatened to<br/>let all of Japan know about my curse if I ever tired to get out of it."<p>"So kill him."<p>Ranma snorted, "I've thought about it, before, but I like Akira. I<br/>won't kill someone I like."<p>Once more, Farfello's creepy pout came forwards, "But those are the<br/>deaths that hurt God the most!"<p>Ranma didn't really have an argument for that. All he knew was that he<br/>didn't want to kill Akira. It might have something to do with the fact<br/>that the man had made him rich. Akira had even stopped Nabiki-<br/>indirectly, of course- from marketing Ranma-onna's image, due to Ranko<br/>"looking like a cheap knock-off of Xue Shi."<p>"I want to kill something," Farfello growled into Ranma's neck, "Rip<br/>something into itty bitty bloody pieces. Make God's smile crack, and<br/>his eyes pour. He'll never hurt me, if I hurt him first! To bath in the<br/>blood of innocence, and listen to his heart shatter, and laugh, and<br/>laugh, and laugh..."<p>Farfello had switched to English, speaking with a thick, Irish broque,<br/>halfway through his ranting. The pale haired assassin nipped at his<br/>pet's skin, then pulled back to stare into the night. Ranma had tensed<br/>almost imperceptibly, before relaxing completely. He was ready for<br/>anything.<p>Well, almost anything, except the purple and white cat that strode out<br/>of the shadows in their direction. Despite his swiftly returning feline<br/>instincts and thoughts, Ranma still wasn't quite rid of his<br/>ailurophobia. He gave a wailing scream of terror, twisting out of<br/>Farfello's grip, to cower behind him. His master would protect him, his<br/>panicked mind whimpered, Jei-sama would keep the evil thing away.<p>Farfello looked at his Kitty in confusion, then looked back at the cat<br/>who was terrifying his property, "...Can I kill it?"<p>The whimper from behind him was all the information he needed. His<br/>knife slipped into his hand, a malicious smile crossing his face. The<br/>cat stopped, and stared at the unknown man for several moments.<br/>Farfello's grin broke, and he spoke, "Killing kittens hurts God."<p>He lunged at the cat, and it nimbly dodged out of his way. A low growl,<br/>and a sadistic grin, was sent in the cat's direction. Cackling madly,<br/>the Irishman lashed out with a sharp kick. The cat took the attack in<br/>the ribs, flying back; it rolled when it hit the ground, bouncing to<br/>it's feet, and hissing. Farfello started after it, but it ran off into<br/>the night.<p>The pout returned, "No kill?"<p>"Z'it gone...?" the madman turned back to his pet, who was curling out<br/>of the fetal position he'd assumed when Farfello went after the cat.<p>"Gone," Farfello agreed, "but not dead. I wanted to kill it!"<p>"Her," Ranma corrected, "That was Shampoo. She thinks she's my wife."<p>"What?" Jei had heard about Xian Phu when he'd first met up with Kitty,<br/>again. He had, of course, assumed she was human.<p>"Jhusenkyou, Spring of drowned Cat," Ranma explained, "Normally, she's<br/>human. With purple hair, and happens to have a great body."<p>Farfello growled angrily, pulling Ranma to him, "You're mine!"<p>From any of the Fiancée Front, such possessiveness would have had Ranma<br/>freaking out, and desperately trying to get away without getting<br/>killed. The fact that it was his Jei-sama, simply had him relaxing<br/>against his master. He didn't even protest Farfello's talking as though<br/>he was an object to possess.<p>"Of course."<p>-<p>"Great-grandmother! Great-grandmother!" Xian Phu darted from the<br/>kitchen, naked as the day she was born. It didn't really matter- there<br/>was no one there to see her. Muu Tzu was off training to get rid of<br/>Ranma, "once and for all", and since it was after dark, the Nekohanten<br/>was closed.<p>"What is it, child?"<p>Xian Phu switched to mandarin, so that there would be no mistakes in<br/>what she said, "Husband was with this man. I wanted to surprise him,<br/>but I got splashed first," she shivered, just noticing that she was<br/>naked. After a moment, she gathered herself, "I came out to greet him,<br/>but he ducked behind the man."<p>"He didn't run?" Khu Lon interrupted.<p>Xian Phu shook her head, "He screamed, and even whimpered, but he<br/>didn't run. The man... Goddess Above! Great-grandmother, he asked<br/>Husband if he could _kill_ me, then he attacked me! He came at him with<br/>a knife, but I dodged, and he _kicked_ me! If I hadn't gotten away,<br/>there's no doubt. He would have killed me."<p>"This does not sound good. Son-in-law hasn't been the same since the<br/>battle at Jusendou. We must watch him."<p>End<p>[1] Before anyone makes a comment, they've been friends forever,<br/>remember?<br/>[2] Temporarily Sane. See, he's already going back. If he'd stayed<br/>sane, he wouldn't have said that, now would he? *smirk*<p>And yes, there is a purpose to the Amazon scene. Mwahahahahahaha...
