</div>There is a reason this chapter ends like this. There is only one<br/>person who knows WHY it ends like this (Hey Averry :P). And yes, it<br/>does have relevance to the story ^-^V *snickers wildly*<p>In other news, I've got a new fic. It's called "Shiva". It's final<br/>fantasy eight. It's only on . And it's only being<br/>updated about every three weeks. False Identity will still be coming<br/>out every week.<p>Oh, yeah, my website's up and running properly, again.<br/>.net/~li_xiang, for those of you who haven't<br/>followed the link from my  account. The StoryTeller<br/>needs updating. I'll get there... eventually.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Ten: Pawns<br/>Li Xiang<p>It was a three-man mission. Aya had bailed, due to Ranko's sudden<br/>cold. It was the first time ever, but it wasn't all that important of<br/>a mission anyway. Just some old politician who was wanted dead.<p>The redhead had a feeling that this would end up as an Schwartz/Weiss<br/>battle. Again.<p>-<p>They had met, and they had fought just as Aya had predicted they<br/>would. And, while it was not unusual for someone to return injured<br/>from battle, it was unusual for only two of three to return.<p>Omi and Yohji stumbled into the Koneko, blood dribbling from wounds,<br/>and soaking poorly crafted makeshift bandages. Yohji held his hand<br/>over the left side of his face, glimpses of dark-red blood stained<br/>skin between his fingers.<p>Omi, too, was bleeding, his white hood soaked with blood, he looked<br/>unable to do anything but drag himself to a chair.<p>Aya had waited for his partners to return, first aid kit in hand. He'd<br/>had a feeling it would be needed. Ranko was sleeping upstairs- in her<br/>own room, this time.<p>"What happened?" Omi looked like he could handle the wounds a bit<br/>longer- Yohji was about to collapse. In fact, the eldest of them<br/>collapsed into a chair as Aya tugged his hands away from his face. It<br/>wasn't really something he was used doing for other people, but<br/>neither looked capable of caring for themselves.<p>"Schwartz," Omi muttered the obvious, "Farfello and Crawford double<br/>teamed Yohji. Schuldich was on Ken, and Nagi, me."<p>Aya- ever calm, ever cool, unless dealing with screaming fangirls-<br/>winced. Farfello had tagged Yohji pretty bad. It looked like the<br/>Irishman had tried to gouge the lanky man's eye out. The slash had<br/>just barely missed Yohji's left eye, running at a diagonal from scalp<br/>to cheek bone. There was less than two millimeters between the edge of<br/>the cut and the outside corner of his eye.<p>There was no doubt in Aya's mind. He'd seen enough blade wounds to<br/>_know_ Yohji's will scar. He also knew it would need stitches.<p>"How bad...?"<p>Aya had turned to pull the sewing needle and thread from the first aid<br/>kit, "You need stitches."<p>The playboy gave a slight whine from the back of his throat, but sat<br/>still as Aya pressed a wet cloth to the wound. A faint whimper of pain<br/>from behind him had the redhead setting the needle down to check on<br/>Omi. Hopefully it would only take a few minutes, and he'd be able to<br/>get back to stitching up Yohji's face.<p>The youngest of Weiss had shed both of his jackets- the black<br/>crumpled across the floor, the white draped over the back of the<br/>chair. Aya could see what looked like knife wounds that matched the<br/>few throwing knives Omi had brought with him for the mission.<p>The logical conclusion was that Nagi had caught the blades with his<br/>telekinesis- and sent them back to the other hacker. All Omi needed<br/>was a few proper bandages; he wasn't all that bad off, considering<br/>he'd only had to fend off Naoe Nagi.<p>Once the boy had been taken care of, about five minutes later. Aya<br/>turned back to the needle and thread he'd pulled out. Quickly<br/>threading the needle, Aya tugged the cloth from Yohji's face, "Hold<br/>still."<p>The assassin closed his eyes with a bit of a whimper as the needle<br/>passed through the skin of his forehead.<p>-<p>Ranma paused at the top of the stairs. She'd heard two people enter<br/>the Koneko. She'd heard them stop and not move again. She'd heard<br/>slight whimpers of pain, and the statement of who was fighting whom.<br/>Then she'd smelt the blood.<p>With the Cat's ability to use ki to heighten her senses, Ranma had<br/>been on 'full alert' since the water fight. Consciously activating<br/>said ability was a lot harder than letting the Cat do it<br/>unconsciously. She _really_ didn't want to have to force it again, so<br/>she hadn't bothered to "turn it off", so to speak.<p>She drifted down the stairs, wondering just what she'd see.<p>Aya putting away a needle and thread, Omi practically passed out in<br/>his chair, and Yohji staring blankly at the ceiling with one eye- the<br/>other being closed as not to pull the skin beneath the stitches- and<br/>Ken nowhere to be seen had not been what she'd expected.<p>-<p>Ken, at that moment, was slowly regaining consciousness.<p>He found himself sprawled across a small bed, a thin sheet thrown over<br/>his body. His bugnuks and communication devices missing- not to<br/>mention damn near all his clothing. He had his boxers and his t-shirt<br/>still on, but that was it. The wounds on his arms and legs had been<br/>bandaged.<p>All of this was, of course, offset by the shackle around his right<br/>wrist, locking him to the bed with a chain of about five feet in<br/>length. A test of its strength revealed that it was unlikely he'd<br/>break it.<p>He raked his mind, trying to remember how he'd gotten to this small<br/>bedroom/cell. He came up with a blank- the last thing he could<br/>remember was fighting Schuldich. He'd knocked the older man back and<br/>went running to give Yohji a hand with Crawford and Farfello. He could<br/>remember a sharp spike of pain lancing through both skull and mind,<br/>and then... nothing.<p>With no idea where he was, or how he'd gotten there, Ken was leery of<br/>trying the one thing that would get him free. It was one of the few<br/>things he had from his life prior to Weiss; also one of the things<br/>Kritiker did _not_ know about him. But he did not know what else to<br/>do.<p>He relaxed his ever-present concentration. It had gotten to the point,<br/>over the years, that even during sleep or unconsciousness his mind to<br/>focused enough to control it. He was normally so focused on himself<br/>that he was clumsy in doing mundane, everyday things.<p>Ken's wrist passed through the shackle, with no mark left behind. He<br/>also happened to sink about halfway through the bed before noticing.<br/>Shaking his head, the young man pulled himself free, snapping his<br/>iron-clad control back in place. The feeling of passing _through_<br/>objects had _always_ creeped him out.<p>Shivering as the cold air brushed across his skin, he grabbed the<br/>sheet from the bed, wrapping it around himself. He was halfway to the<br/>room's door when it swung open.<p>Schuldich stood there.<p>He also happened to look a bit surprised at Ken's freedom, but quickly<br/>hid it. Ken growled at the sight of the black hunter.<p>"I take it I'm Schwartz's prisoner, now?"<p>"No," Schuldich said this with a maddening grin, "Crawford doesn't<br/>know I have you. You're _my_ prisoner."<p>-<p>Ranko _stared_ at Omi.<p>"You don't know...? I thought he was one of your partners, Tsukiyono!"<p>"He's my friend!"<p>"Then how could you _not_ know where he is?" Aya's hand landed on her<br/>shoulder, and she shot him a dark look. She may not have any "real"<br/>friends, but she knew they were supposed to watch each other. Hell,<br/>she'd looked out for enemies and allies who were normally enemies back<br/>during her days in Nerima. The only one she did not know where he was<br/>on a regular basis was Ryouga- and that was for a very good reason.<p>Aya's look told her to shut up and sit down. She returned it with one<br/>that had 'I'm not doing this because you said to, I'm just not feeling<br/>well' stamped all across it.<p>She gave an exaggerated cough just for good measure.<p>Yohji had passed out in his chair- which was expected, considering<br/>the blood he'd lost, the pain of the wound itself, on top of having to<br/>drag himself back to the Koneko in that state. Ranko dropped herself<br/>onto the arm of the chair Yohji was in, with a scowl.<p>"Ranko."<p>"Yeeeeees, Aya?"<p>Aya paused for a moment, before firming his resolve. At this point, he<br/>didn't really care that she found out he knew, "Contact Schuldich."<p>She blinked, "Eh? Why should I?"<p>"Because," the older redhead snapped, "He was the one fighting Ken!"<p>"Okay, Okay, no shouting necessary."<p>/Schuldich,/ she reached out along the thin mental pathway that<br/>spanned the distance between their two minds and sing-songed, /Where<br/>are you?/<p>There was a few minutes of silence followed by, /What is it, Bishoujo?<br/>I'm busy!/<p>/Doing what?/<p>/Stuff. What do you want?/<p>Ranko snickered a bit, /Sooooo, you were fighting Ken?/<p>/The weiss katzchen returned, did they?/<p>/They did,/ Ranko smirked a bit. Of course, Aya shot her a look that<br/>clearly meant for her to get their answer, /Any ways, Aya's giving me<br/>evil looks... where is he?/<p>Schuldich gave a snort of amusement, responding, /What makes you think<br/>_I_ know?/<p>/I don't. Aya says you do./<p>/Abyssian's a smart one, then,/ Schuldich started to withdraw from her<br/>mind.<p>/You going to tell me where he is?/<p>/Unlikely,/ and then, the jade-eyed assassin's presence in her mind<br/>was gone. Ranko returned her attention to the outside world.<p>"He's got Ken."<p>Omi's face paled, "Where? Where is he?"<p>Ranko's look was pure disdain, "Riiiight. Even if Schuldich had told<br/>me, why would I tell _you_, Tsukiyono?"<p>"Ranko."<p>"Aya," she mimicked, "Like I said- Schuldich didn't tell me where he<br/>is." Her face lit up even as she fended off a sneeze, and jumped to<br/>her feet, "Oh! I could go look for him!"<p>"You can't! Schwartz will kill you!"<p>Three guesses to who that was. Both Aya and Ranko ignored Omi's<br/>outburst. Violet and blue eyes were looked in a test of wills.<br/>Fujimiya spoke, not looking away, "You will not."<p>"Dammit Abyssian!" the girl's eyes narrowed into slits, "Your word<br/>ain't law! Stop acting like you can dictate my life!"<p>"You let Farfello do it."<p>Ranko's eyes flared with anger, turning smoky-blue eyes into an ice<br/>hard navy blue, "That's different. I owe Jei-sama a hell of a lot more<br/>than I owe you."<p>"Sit. Down."<p>She sat before she even realized she was following Aya's orders. When<br/>she did, she made as though she was going to jump to her feet just to<br/>spite him. Something in his eyes, however, forced her to stay put.<p>-<p>Schuldich's gaze had wavered for a moment, and Ken dart for the door.<br/>Schuldich, however, was faster. He grabbed the back of Ken's shirt,<br/>tugging him backwards.<p>Mentally, Ken cursed. He cursed the fact that he couldn't phase<br/>through living objects- or at least, make whatever he was wearing<br/>phase through living objects, and he really didn't want to stand naked<br/>in front of the redhead.<p>Schuldich was grinning at him, "Abyssian tried to force me to tell<br/>them where you are."<p>"Gwah?" the soccer player looked confused, "But Aya doesn't..."<p>"He got Bishoujo to do it," the redhead smirked at his captive, "not<br/>that it helped." He used Ken's shirt to drag the boy away from the<br/>door. He tossed the white hunter across the bed again, causing Ken to<br/>lose his breath on impact. The jade-eyed assassin followed a moment<br/>later, dropping onto the bed and propping himself up on his arms, over<br/>Ken's stunned form.<p>"I wonder how long it will take him to figure it out..."<p>Ken's mind snapped back into focus. He shifted to bring his hands up<br/>to shove the German away from him. Schuldich's response to both<br/>movement and thoughts was to drop his full weight on the younger man.<br/>Ken froze, and Schuldich smirked.<p>"...After all... this afternoon wasn't _just_ for fun..."<p>Ken was attempting to suffocate himself; he didn't even breath until<br/>Schuldich sat up. The redhead was frowning slightly; while the<br/>brunette let the German's words slide through his mind on auto repeat.<p>"...Farfie should be happy once he lets Bishoujo go..."<p>Who _was_ Schuldich talking about? Bishoujo had to be Ranko- he<br/>doubted Aya would be willingly in contact with anyone else linked to<br/>Schuldich in any way at all. Still, he didn't know who this "he" was.<p>"He" could be anyone, and none of Weiss would go near anyone from<br/>Schwartz without lethal intentions.<p>-<p>"Schuldich is playing mind games," Omi was pacing. After relocating<br/>rYohji to his room, the three currently awake housemates retreated to<br/>Weiss' mission room. The young brunette was halfway to panicked with<br/>the news that Schuldich has Ken, "He's always playing mind games."<p>"No, he's not," Ranko snorted, leaning against the wall, "He wasn't<br/>when we ran into him this afternoon."<p>"You... ran into him?"<p>"Yeah," the girl rubbed her nose, "You didn't think Aya and I had gone<br/>running through park sprinklers on purpose did you? We got into a<br/>water fight with the Guilty One."<p>Aya frowned, looking over at Omi, "Maybe he was..."<p>Ranko hiked an eyebrow, "Care to explain that?"<p>"He knows your abilities, correct?"<p>"Yeah, so?" Ranko's blank look made Aya sigh in irritation, as Omi<br/>looked between the two of them, absolutely confused. It would take too<br/>long to explain to Omi of Schuldich and Ranko's connection. Aya,<br/>himself, wasn't completely aware of everything she was capable of<br/>doing, but he'd seen her move; he _knew_ she was an exception martial<br/>artist, he just didn't know _how_ exceptional.<p>"If Schuldich orchestrated this, he probably left some sort of clue,<br/>specifically to torment us with trying to understand."<p>Ranko frowned, scratching at the scar in back of her neck, "You mean<br/>he meant to run into us today?'<p>Aya shook his head, "I'm not sure. Ranko, did he tell you anything?<br/>Like why he was going to the park in the first place?"<p>"Nothing," the female redhead frowned slightly, "Although, he did<br/>smell funny; like he was nervous.<p>Both active members of Weiss gave her a surprised look. Omi was the<br/>one who voiced their thoughts, "Smelt _nervous_? How could you smell<br/>_that_?"<p>The look of disdain returned, "Jei-sama gave me the name 'Kitty' for a<br/>reason, Tsukiyono."<p>"Oh," Omi's voice was quiet, until he lit up on what Ranko had said<br/>originally, "Nervous? Why would he be nervous?"<p>"I'm not a telepath," the redhead snapped, "He was nervous, I smelt<br/>it," tipping her head to once side, she spoke thoughtfully,<br/>"Although... I sensed someone watching us. No one was there when I<br/>looked, but..."<p>"It gives us something to work with," Omi gave a determined nod, "I'll<br/>look around the city plans to look for a place near the park, which<br/>one did-"<p>"Juuban."<p>-<p>"Stop teasing him."<p>The woman's voice came from the door, but Schuldich was in the way of<br/>Ken's view. Whoever it was, she sounded... amused.<p>"Ah, but that's not fun," Schuldich returned in German. The woman<br/>laughed lightly, and spoke in German, as well.<p>"Fun! He wants fun! Lord above, Schu, in ten years you haven't changed<br/>a mite!"<p>The older man smirked, pulling away from Ken. He patted the<br/>nineteen-year-old on the head, giving him a patronizing grin, "Don't<br/>try to leave, liebe."<p>"I told you to stop teasing him, Schuldich."<p>"Aa, aa," as Schuldich moved away, Ken caught a glimpse of chin-length<br/>brownish red hair, and emerald eyes. But it was, after all, only a<br/>glimpse. Far from enough to be able to tell who it was.<p>-<p>The sun has risen four hours earlier. While it would not have been<br/>impossible for Omi, Aya and Ranko to work in the shop- they had more<br/>important things to deal with.<p>Omi was skimming the net, looking for info on Ken's whereabouts. Aya<br/>was in contact with Kritiker for the same reasons, and Ranko was<br/>playing nurse for Yohji.<p>The two redheads had played jan ken pon and Ranko lost.<p>Yohji was still out as Ranko checked the stitches. She wasn't the<br/>greatest choice for a doctor, or a nurse for that matter, but she knew<br/>enough. She had, after all, been in a number of "incidents" and had<br/>nearly everything possible done to her, before. She began to sing<br/>under her breath as she did so- musing that it would probably have<br/>sounded better if she was male at the time.<p>"Forfeit the game/Before somebody else<br/>Takes you out of the frame/Puts your name to shame<br/>Cover up your face/You can't run the race<br/>The pace is to fast/You just won't last<p>"You loved the way I look at you<br/>While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through<br/>You take away if I give in<br/>My life, My pride is broken..."<p>"You're pretty good, Ranko."<p>The redhead gave the man under her hands a decidedly dark look, "How<br/>long have you been awake?"<p>"Since 'cover up your face'," he gave her a grin, and in return, she<br/>buried her fist in his stomach. It was amusing to see his eyes pop<br/>open, and an expression of pure agony flit across the wounded man's<br/>face.<p>"Careful Kudou," she sing-songed, with a malicious grin, "You wouldn't<br/>want to pop your stitches, would you?"<p>She stood, sashaying out of the room, singing to herself, but<br/>partially to Yohji,<p>"If I/Turn my back I'm defenseless<br/>And to go blindly seems senseless<br/>If I hide my pride and let it all go on/Then they'll<br/>Take from me til everything is gone..."<p>End<p>The songs are "Points of Authority", and "By Myself", by Linkin Park
