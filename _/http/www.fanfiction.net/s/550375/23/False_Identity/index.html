</div>Je-fucking-sus.<p>This story is longer than a few of my favorites! And while False<br/>Identity is pretty much ended (all that's left is the epilogue) I'm no<br/>where near finished messing around. There _is_ a sequel planned, my<br/>friends! As if you couldn't tell from all the hints I've been dropping.<p>I have a prereader again! Yay! Let's all clap!<p>In anycase, you might end up waiting a couple weeks to read the epilogue;<br/>it's summer, and I'm going camping for the next week. I missed my trip<br/>last year due to my uncle dying. I'm not missing it _this_ year!<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Twenty-two: Blood<br/>Li Xiang<p>It was a nice night to be out.<p>Shadows lengthened as night deepened, the street lights flickering off<br/>then on, as some insect or another flew into the hypnotizing light. Men<br/>and women traveled the streets, sleepily making their way back to their<br/>homes for their brief hours of sleep until they had to rise and greet<br/>the dawn, one more time. But dawn was many hours from then. A dawn that<br/>would gift the world with yet another grisly death.<p>Two deaths, Ranma thought to himself, smirking slightly. Wrapped in the<br/>cloak of the umi-sen-ken as he was, he was all but impossible to<br/>detect. It was, however, highly unlikely that anyone who was not<br/>psionically active, would be able to find him.<p>His senses on full alert, the bloodlust of the Cat prowling behind the<br/>bars Ranma had locked it under. This was cause for precision, and<br/>careful planning. The Cat was more likely to pause, to stop, then play.<br/>So Ranma reigned in it's instincts, and for the first time in nearly a<br/>week, thought with the clear, analytical mind of a Master of the Art.<br/>He was prepared to do his part.<p>The sixteen year old could feel the presences of those the Cat<br/>designated as his packmates. There was Schuldich, the flame haired<br/>German taking point on the roof of one business. Crawford striding<br/>purposely up the sidewalk, dressed impeccably in a white suit, looking<br/>for all the world like he was a high end businessman on his way home from<br/>work. Farfello skulked through the shadows, in an alley, coming from<br/>the opposite direction.<p>Nagi was following the same path as Farfello, although he kept to the<br/>lighted streets, still dressed in his school uniform, a mask of<br/>tiredness and weariness artfully composed. Kojiro and his mother paced<br/>the sidewalk, arms hooked and cuddling like any normal couple out for a<br/>late night stroll.<p>Each one of them carried their weapons, as the plan came to fruitation.<br/>They would not fail.<p>It had taken them, Kitty reflected, nearly two hours to go over the<br/>plan and make changes as the Schwartz members saw fit. Another hour to<br/>get them all into their "starting positions", as Kojiro had jokingly<br/>called them, using Schuldich as a relay for when they had all gotten<br/>into place. Now, as they traveled from shadow to shadow, each with the<br/>perfect grace that their professions had drilled into them over the<br/>years, the game would begin.<p>Ranma's smirk stretched into a wicked grin, his ki sparking behind his<br/>eyes, carefully leashed, but ready to be released in a moment's notice.<br/>If he had to, the gender-bending martial artist would bring the power<br/>he'd used to defeat Saffron to bear. No one hurt his mother and got<br/>away with it.<p>Ranma couldn't help humming the tune that went with the words that ran<br/>through his mind. A soft chuckle rang distinctly through him as<br/>Schuldich forcibly reminded him that there was a reason for them to be<br/>slinking through the night, towards the Nekohanten.<p>There would be hell to pay- and Khu Lon was about to understand what<br/>it meant to have Saotome Ranma pissed off at her. The laughter that<br/>snaked it's way from his mouth was soft at first, before building into<br/>a maddening crescendo, that Jei had to join in once he heard it.<p>The laughter that came from nowhere, yet everywhere, echoing off<br/>buildings sent pedestrians running, terrified for their lives, and even<br/>made one Kunou Kodachi shiver with terror.<p>-<p>/Bishoujo seems to be having a bit to much fun with this/<p>Kojiro jumped at the tight ban telepathy rang through his mind. Nodoka,<br/>too, started, but calmed quicker, resting a hand lightly against<br/>Kojiro's chest, "It's just Schuldich, Kojiro."<p>"I know that," the man mumbled, "I'm just not used to working with<br/>telepaths. I work with normal assassins. _Normal_ ones. Not telepaths!"<p>/I'm injured that you would feel so disgusted about working with me/<br/>Schuldich pouted into their minds.<p>"Be silent, Schuldich," Nodoka hissed, "We're almost there, and we need<br/>our concentration."<p>/Whatever you say, Madam Raven./ The slight pressure of an extra<br/>presence in their backs of their minds vanished, as the pair drew up<br/>next to the closed doors of the Nekohanten. They only had to wait for a<br/>moment, before Muu Tzu came flying through the door, in human form. As<br/>the amazon boy touched down, he rolled, kipupping to his feet and<br/>staring around himself with wide eyes, glasses perched on his forehead.<p>There had been no one in the Nekohanten aside from himself and Khu Lon.<br/>Khu Lon had been upstairs when he'd been thrown out- by someone who<br/>had not been there. He'd felt something grip him, like a giant's hand,<br/>it wrapped around his whole body, and he'd gone hurtling through the<br/>door.<p>There was no one outside, either. While Muu Tzu had been getting to his<br/>feet, Nodoka and Kojiro darted inside the building, Farfello joining<br/>them via the backdoor, to the alley. He'd make sure the job got done,<br/>if it was too much for Nodoka to handle alone.<p>"What the hell was that, Muu Tzu?" Khu Lon froze as she finished<br/>pogoing down the stairs. Muu Tzu was not in the room, but three<br/>familiar figures were. Her eyes landed first on Farfello, and she felt<br/>her blood boil- this was the man who had been the one to slit her<br/>great granddaughter's throat, to kill her, as it was. Then came Kojiro,<br/>who she'd actually had a pleasant talk with while awaiting Lady Raven's<br/>arrival the night prior.<p>Her blood, boiling as it was, instantly chilled, almost turning to ice<br/>as she got a good look at the final figure. Nodoka stood tall and<br/>proud, dressed in a simple red kimono, with a red obi, and no<br/>decorations, no patterns. Her sword was held in a steady grip at her<br/>side, the sheath tucked into the back of her obi. Frozen blue eyes<br/>stared into the ancient amazon's withered face, and a faint smirk<br/>curled the lips of the female assassin.<p>"You made a grave mistake in attacking me, Khu Lon," the amazon<br/>stiffened. Nodoka's words had been spoken in perfect mandarin- in the<br/>amazon dialect, even.<p>"How...?"<p>"Did I survive?" the smile that had painted her face a moment earlier<br/>vanished, "Let's just say I have more in common with my son than hair<br/>color." There was a crash outside the doors, and Muu Tzu's howl of<br/>extreme pain.<p>-<p>Ranma had gleefully pounced on Muu Tzu as the boy searched for the<br/>reason for his being thrown out the door. Sweeping the Chinese boy into<br/>a full nelson, Ranma hissed into his ear, "Guess who's still alive."<p>"Saotome!" Muu Tzu thrashed, finally flipping Ranma off of himself, and<br/>sending the pigtailed youth into the Nekohanten wall. A split second<br/>later, Muu Tzu gave a howl of pain as Nagi focused his telekinesis on<br/>keeping the boy still. Ranma's ki claws buried themselves into the<br/>boy's stomach, while a single bullet from Crawford's gun rang out.<br/>While the bullet merely bounced off the kevlar armor the boy wore<br/>beneath his robes, Ranma's ki claws were energy, pure and simple,<br/>slicing through the armor. They flickered out a moment later, as blood<br/>soaked the white robes.<p>A nasty, almost insane look crossed the gender-shifting teenager's<br/>face, terrifying Muu Tzu, who's glasses had fallen over his eyes. He'd<br/>never seen Ranma look like this, except... except while in the Nekoken.<br/>The claws led him to believe that _that_ had to be it- but a second of<br/>staring into chilling smokey blue eyes left that train of thought in<br/>the dust. There was intelligence shining in his eyes.<p>Ruthless, bloodthirsty, evil intelligence, but intelligence none the<br/>less.<p>Was this what Saffron saw? Muu Tzu spent an eternal instant wondering.<br/>Did the Phoenix god see his own death in Saotome's eyes? Oh god, I<br/>don't want to die... then the instant fled, and Muu Tzu found himself<br/>able to move again. One hand flew, by instinct, to the wound in his<br/>stomach, pain radiating outwards, throughout his body. Blood soaked his<br/>fingers, just as his blood soaked Ranma's hands.<p>"I've never gotten to taste your blood," Ranma mused to himself, "I've<br/>had Ryouga's, and Oyagi's before, but never yours..." he trailed off,<br/>lifting his hand to his mouth and running his tongue over the back of<br/>his hand like a big cat.<p>Muu Tzu saw his chance, leaping forwards to attack while Ranma was<br/>distracted. The fact that Ranma was distracted by his blood sickened<br/>him, but he ignored it for the moment. When Ranma was dead, he could<br/>hurl at the thought all he wanted. The Chinese boy knew, very well,<br/>that some women in his village still followed the tradition of eating<br/>the heart of any male they killed, raw and dripping with fresh blood.<br/>It was a disgusting ritual, and had always made him throw up whenever<br/>he saw the gruesome act.<p>This wasn't as bad, but it was still gross enough to make his stomach<br/>do flip-flops.<p>"FIST OF THE WHITE SWAN!" he roared, launching the potty-training seat<br/>at his enemy, following that with a ruthless side kick to Ranma's gut<br/>in an attempt to take the martial artist out.<p>But the amazon had forgotten to take blood loss into account as he<br/>moved into the attack. His first attack fell short by four inches,<br/>causing Ranma to look up at his opponent. The kick was sloppy and weak,<br/>Muu Tzu trying desperately to keep his balance and connect. Ranma's<br/>hand dropped into the way, catching his foot. With the slightest of<br/>tugs, Muu Tzu found himself falling forwards- Ranma's fist ramming him<br/>in the solar plexus at full strength, throwing him back to land<br/>haphazardly on the ground, staring up at the sky, daze and panting.<p>"You see, Mousse, you _really_ shouldn't have attacked me last night.<br/>Like the Amerikajin say- Payback's a bitch."<p>He crawled to his knees, then stumbled to his feet as he stood up.<br/>Using the conveniently placed light post, Muu Tzu braced himself. Ranma<br/>was walking slowly, like a predator who knows his prey is his to play<br/>with. Lifting both arms, the male amazon triggered the small bit of ki<br/>in the folds of his robes, unfolding the pockets of ki that surrounded<br/>him. Hundreds of weapons lashed out from his clothing- on chains or<br/>not- ripping the air to pieces as they flew at Ranma. Shuriken,<br/>throwing knives, darts and arrows even launched from his hair to attack<br/>his opponent.<p>But Ranma had had an entire day to recover from the attack the night<br/>before- having slept during to day to rid himself of his sleep<br/>depravation- and would not be taken down so easily again. The weapons<br/>were focused on where he _had_ been, as Ranma had leapt into the air,<br/>lightly landing on the highest of the chains, running lightly down the<br/>links to deliver a sharp snap kick to Muu Tzu's skull. His head snapped<br/>back, cracking against the pole, and the boy slumped to the ground.<p>After a moment, Ranma kicked the teen, just to check. No movement. The<br/>boy's breath was shallow, and he looked up at the members of Schwartz<br/>around him, "Do we leave him unconscious, or do we kill him?"<p>"Leaving him unconscious means he's likely to recover and attack us<br/>again," Nagi watched the boy with narrowed eyes, "And he's strong. He<br/>almost broke out of my hold on him when I threw him from the restaurant<br/>the first time- I couldn't even get a grip on him the second time."<p>"I'd noticed," Ranma looked at the young boy, then over at Crawford,<br/>"Hey, you see the future, right? Why didn't you see your shot not going<br/>through like we planned?"<p>Crawford gave Kitty a flat-eyed stare, but did not speak. He wasn't<br/>about to reveal that Ranma, himself, was the reason he couldn't get a<br/>clear picture of the future, and that various snippets he did see-<br/>which were less than normal, at that- were confused. Until Ranma<br/>officially started working for them/with them/against them, Crawford<br/>would be unable to get a clear picture. It all depended on how the<br/>boy's loyalties would fall. His stay with Weiss had been unpredicted,<br/>his blossoming friendship with Abyssian had shocked him quite a bit,<br/>having not expected it.<p>"Alright, alright, if you don't want to tell me, fine," Ranma lifted<br/>his hands to his mouth to finish licking the blood off, having let the<br/>Cat loose once again, "I'm going to go check on Jei-sama and mom."<p>The three Schwartz members turned their gazes on the unconscious<br/>martial artist before them, and Crawford lifted his gun once more,<br/>carefully aiming it at Muu Tzu's skull. He paused a moment, awaiting a<br/>vision to see if his actions would be halted, then smiled. It was not a<br/>nice smile.<p>-<p>As all this happened, Nodoka and Khu Lon faced off. Kojiro and<br/>Farfello- no matter how much Farfello had wanted to be part of the<br/>bloodshed- had backed off to watch from the wall. Khu Lon had speed,<br/>and skill on her side. Nodoka had reach and a natural gift for swords<br/>on hers.<p>The amazon elder lead off, a jab to the pressure point on Nodoka's<br/>wrist for her to drop the sword- it worked, but Nodoka merely swapped<br/>hands in that instant, grinning, "I'm ambidextrous."<p>Damn, Khu Lon growled to herself, weaving in and out of attacks that<br/>flew at her with blinding speed. Nodoka was skilled with a sword- no<br/>wonder Genma was terrified of his wife- and she had no compunctions<br/>against taking blood. Khu Lon had little doubt that _that_ was the<br/>reason she had come. Revenge for her near death the night before. The<br/>Old woman didn't stay focused on that for long, nor on wondering<br/>exactly _how_ Nodoka had survived the fatal shot...<p>...that reminded her...<p>One moment she was parrying sword strikes with her staff, the next she<br/>was across the room, firing her small 9mm handgun. Nodoka grit her<br/>eeth, dodging as best she could, and still receiving a bullet to her<br/>shoulder for her efforts. Three more shots rang out, and again Nodoka<br/>dodged. Only one bullet hit her flesh this time- cutting across the<br/>flat of her stomach- the other two ripping through the silk of her<br/>kimono, but not her.<p>Letting a hissing breath through her teeth, Nodoka only let herself<br/>calm down from her frantic dodging when Khu Lon dropped the gun. Empty<br/>of bullets as it was, it was pretty much useless. There was no point in<br/>trying to put another clip in. In the time it would take to do that,<br/>Nodoka could quite feasiblely cut her into pieces.<p>Oh yes, Khu Lon had noticed that Nodoka was strengthening, and<br/>sharpening, the sword with her own ki. It was probably the only ki<br/>manipulation the woman knew, but it was a dangerous one. The blade had<br/>become sharp enough to cut through diamond.<p>Rolling her shoulder- the one with the bullet still in it- Nodoka<br/>scowled at her opponent. Across the room, Kojiro stood, slack jawed, as<br/>for the first time ever, he got to see Nodoka fight full-out with her<br/>sword. Farfello had pulled out one of his knives to suckle on it,<br/>seeing as he wasn't allowed to participate until Nodoka went down.<br/>Normally, he wouldn't have cared, but the warnings from both Crawford<br/>and Kitty as to what should happen to him if he interfered kept him<br/>from leaping in to massacre.<p>Nodoka licked her lips, dropping into a defensive stance, and creeping<br/>closer to Khu Lon, waiting for anything.<p>Well, almost anything. The Splitting Cat Hairs technique was not one<br/>the woman had been prepared for. The multiple images of Khu Lon dancing<br/>around her, darting in and out to attack confused her. She'd whirl to<br/>defend herself, but that image was just like smoke, impervious, as she<br/>was hit from behind by Khu Lon herself.<p>A snarl curled the woman's lips as bruises began to form, and paralysis<br/>stole over half her body. She found herself unable to move her legs-<br/>legs unable to hold her up and she tumbled to the floor, katana still<br/>in her grip. She would not lose this battle!<p>The images faded as Khu Lon launched a frontal attack, merely for the<br/>sake of seeing the shock on Nodoka's face as she was utterly defeated-<br/>then killed. She would not make the same mistake she had the night<br/>before.<p>There was one thing Khu Lon forgot, in paralyzing Nodoka.<p>Nodoka had told her, out right, she was ambidextrous. Khu Lon only<br/>froze the arm that had been holding the sword. In one single, fluid<br/>movement, the katana went from her paralyzed left hand to her right<br/>hand. And in the movement, Nodoka raised the sword.<p>Khu Lon, in her overconfidence, found herself impaled on the sword. The<br/>redheaded middle aged woman snarled at the ancient amazon, "Now, it<br/>ends." And she jerked the sword upwards.<p>Kojiro felt like hurling at the brutality of the death. He was used to<br/>a simple knife through the ribs, or maybe a bullet to the heart or<br/>head. He was not used to seeing a dangerous, old, wrinkled woman get<br/>impaled on a sword, then cut open from stomach to collar. Jei grinned<br/>widely, crowing with joy at the death. This was what he liked. The<br/>death of this ancient woman had been a beautiful display of savagery.<br/>It made him almost _quiver_ with excitement.[1]<p>"Whoa, what happened to the Old Ghoul?"<p>Jei bounded across the room, happily sweeping his Kitty into his arms<br/>and nuzzling his neck. The nuzzling, however, turned into a sharp,<br/>stinging bite that drew blood a moment later. Ranma revealed in the<br/>feeling for a second, before returning his attention to his mother.<br/>Nodoka had pulled the blade from her victim's body, removing the cloth<br/>that she always carried to clean the blood off of it. She glanced,<br/>curiously, at her son and the man who was so possessive of him, then<br/>returned to her work.<p>"Cologne was overconfident. She used a frontal assault when it would<br/>have been smarter to attack from behind."<p>"So beautiful," Farfello murmured into his pet's neck, "Her blood<br/>spilled across the floor, splattering with the force of her death. God<br/>wails this night, as one of his oldest children lay dead at our feet.<br/>And he will continue to-" he was cut off by the sound of a single,<br/>unsilenced shot ringing out over the business district. Schuldich let<br/>out a loud whoop, accompanied by a hoot of laughter.<p>/Crawford let off a little bit of steam, unsilenced. We'd better get,<br/>before the cops arrive,/ his voice rushed through their minds, and the<br/>group glanced at each other.<p>Three minutes later, Schwartz, Ranma, Kojiro and Nodoka had left the<br/>premises, the only signs of their even being there, the corpse of Khu<br/>Lon in her restaurant, pinned to the table by her own staff- courtesy<br/>of Farfello, who had no known fingerprints due to burning them off for<br/>fun- and Muu Tzu who lay in a puddle of his own blood against a light<br/>post, a bullet through his skull.<p>It was a nice night, indeed.<p>End<p>[1] is it only me, or is that kind of a scary thought...?
