</div>I've been off tormenting people with sticks. Well, actually, my brother<br/>almost broke my hand while waving his walking stick through the air<br/>like some type of battle staff. And while I'm pretty sure I could have<br/>taken it out bare handed, Devon wanted me to use a stick, too. I got to<br/>hold a hockey stick and pretend it was a glaive.<p>We were also pretending I was a three foot tall dark faerie-chick, my<br/>brother, a three and a half foot tall half human sprite-guy, and Dev<br/>was a silver elf, who towered over bother of us.<p>This is, apparently, what having a life is like. I think I prefer not<br/>having a life, and just writing stories.<p>*clucks her tongue* Ah well, I have revealed who the redhead is. She<br/>is... *drumroll*... Rache! *snickers* Okay, okay, so that's just what<br/>Schu calls her. You have to read to find out who she really is.<p>As for who figured it out... only Yanslana got it. *makes the readers<br/>clap for Yanslana*<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Eleven: Conception<br/>Li Xiang<p>"Where is she?"<p>Sanzenshin Nobuyuki rolled his eyes, listening to his manager rant.<br/>Twirling one drumstick around his fingers, he was seriously considering<br/>whipping the other at him. It wasn't the first time their "prize" voice<br/>took off without telling their manager, Karuna Akira. It was just a<br/>habit of hers.<p>"Lay off, Akira," Daniel Osborne- "Oz" to everyone other than<br/>himself- muttered in English, "She's probably off in China again."<p>"Bzzzt!" the three males turned to the door where another young man<br/>stood, "Our dear Xue Shi has been spotted in Juuban."<p>Akira's head snapped up at Chang Li Fei's words. He was on his feet and<br/>out the door before the other three could react. Oz hiked an eyebrow,<br/>"Who didn't see that one coming?"<p>His companions chuckled, before following Akira.<p>-<p>"Did you know she can sing?"<p>Aya, Omi and Yohji were seated int he mission room, discussing how to<br/>go about rescuing Ken. They'd narrowed his location down to four or<br/>five buildings, and planned to have Ranko use her sense to track the<br/>other teen down. At this moment, Ranko was making lunch.<p>"Who? Ranko?" Omi was obviously tired, almost unable to keep his eyes<br/>open. Aya, despite _looking_ awake, projected an aura of almost passed<br/>out from fatigue. The redhead hadn't gotten much sleep over the past<br/>two days. Yohji nodded.<p>"Yeah, Ranko. She's pretty good, even if she was mocking me."<p>"I wasn't mocking you, Kudou," Ranko stepped from the stairwell, not<br/>bothering to muffle her footsteps. She held the same look-and-feel of<br/>Aya- Although she'd gotten more sleep, her body was still fighting off<br/>the cold she'd caught, "Lunch is ready. It's not the greatest, but..."<p>No other words were nessecary, and she turned on her heel to trudge<br/>upstairs. The boys followed silently, seating themselves at the table<br/>in the kitchen.<p>As they ate, Aya gave them a blurry-eyed look, "Get some sleep. We'll<br/>go through the area tonight."<p>"Hai!" the other three chimed, before returning to their meals in<br/>silence.<p>-<p>The sun was setting upon them as the boys drifted up the street. There<br/>was the odd stranger who nodded a greeting, but most of the<br/>recognizable faces shied away from them.<p>Kitty paraded down the fence as though he was all that mattered in the<br/>world. His mane of black hair was tangled and fell loosely about his<br/>face, stormy cobalt eyes slitted almost closed, and head held high with<br/>pride. Despite this, there was a loop of rope about his neck, trailing<br/>to the hand of the pale haired one beside him.<p>Jei's stride was far from the boastful, cocky one of his younger<br/>"friend". He moved with careful, precise steps. The Irish boy matched<br/>Kitty's speed, neither pulling ahead nor falling behind. A mischievous<br/>smile curved his lips.<p>"Kitty, stop."<p>The dark haired feral child ignored the command, and continued to walk.<br/>A low growl seeped from Jei's throat, before he snapped out an order,<br/>"Kitty! Stop!" and gave a sharp tug on the rope leash in his hand.<p>A hiss escaped the eight year old's mouth, and he whirled to glare at<br/>Jei. The human mind, buried as it was, understood that he'd disobeyed<br/>Jei, and the golden-eyed youth was mad at him for it. The Cat, on the<br/>other hand, cared not for that; he cared for the fact that Jei had<br/>_dared_ to force him to do something.<p>Kitty lunged.<p>-<p>A splash of icy water, complete with ice cubes, rained down on her<br/>head. Eyes snapping open, she managed a sputtering cough while sitting<br/>up. Yohji stood over her with the cup in hand. Ranko responded<br/>politely.<p>"If you're not out of here in the next ten seconds, I will rip you limb<br/>from limb, gut you like a fish, and roast your entrails on a spit, then<br/>eat them before your very eyes."<p>While Yohji didn't actually believe she'd go through with her threat,<br/>there was no reason to take chances. He darted from the room, dropping<br/>the cup in the process. She dropped back onto the western-style<br/>mattress, head sinking into her pillow.<p>She would have remained content to stay there, laying on the plush bed,<br/>in the direct path of a large sunbeam, for the rest of eternity.<br/>Unfortunately for her, someone had decided on intruding.<p>/Good evening, Bishoujo!/<p>"I'm trying to sleep, you German psychopath."<p>/Don't you want to rescue Hidaka?/ the mental smirk was almost over<br/>powering, /If you want to leave him with me, I won't mind.../<p>"You going to tell me where he is?"<p>/Now, now, Bishoujo, that wouldn't be any _fun_/<p>Ranma snorted, "Lunatic." /How about a hint?/<p>Schuldich considered for a moment, /No. Do it on your own, Kitty./<p>Schuldich's presence left as Ranma drew herself up from the bed. A<br/>quick change into black jeans and a black shirt, along with an<br/>adjustment of the collar so the tag was centered, and she was out in<br/>the hall. Omi, Yohji and Aya stood at the top of the stairs, all in<br/>their "assassin gear". Yohji's shades managed to hide the fact that the<br/>stitches in his face came perilously close to his eye.<p>-<p>"Xue Shi! Xue Shi!" Akira had his hands cupped around his mouth,<br/>amplifying his shouts. He looked like an idiot.<p>Oz, Fei, and Nobuyuki, while following him, were also attempting to<br/>look like they didn't know him. The man was such an embarrassment!<p>"Luan-ma!"<p>"Shut the hell up!" and there she was. Xue Shi melted out of the<br/>shadows, eyes glowing in the streetlight like some wild cat's. Her hair<br/>was pulled back in a simple ponytail, and she was dressed in black from<br/>head to toe, "Go away, Akira. I'm doing something."<p>"Xue Shi!" Akira dashed forwards, and almost impaled himself on a<br/>wickedly sharp katana. A red haired man had appeared from the shadows<br/>behind her.<p>"How many names do you _have_, Ranko?"<p>"Lots," Xue Shi stated cooly, before turning back to Akira, "I'll<br/>contact you tomorrow. Right now, we're looking for someone."<p>"Huh?" Nobuyuki stepped forwards, "We could help you!"<p>"Doubtful," the man's icy violet eyes drifted over them, "Ranko, let's<br/>go." She nodded and the pair melted back into the darkness.<p>Akira whimpered, "But... but you're supposed to record tonight..."<p>-<p>"So who..."<p>"None of your business, Kudou."<p>They fell silent, following Ranko as she paced the park Aya, Schuldich<br/>and herself had goofed around in the day prior. She came to a halt at<br/>the edge of the man-made lake. Yohji opened his mouth to speak, but she<br/>beat him to it, "Over there. By the trees."<p>She left the boys behind, padding across the soft grass to peer at the<br/>tree. Oddly enough, there was an aura stamp on the tree- a piece of<br/>someone's aura, to tell those who could sense them that _this_ belonged<br/>to them. Ranko had only just learned how to read them; she couldn't<br/>make her own just yet.<p>Ranko didn't recognize the stamp, but the aura was similar to<br/>Schuldich's. An obvious clue to a skilled martial artist; all she had<br/>to do was find the matching stamp.<p>-<p>"...go away."<p>Schuldich grinned at his captive, "Don't you want to know how your<br/>friends are doing?"<p>Ken didn't even bother to lift his face from the pillow, "If Aya<br/>doesn't have his katana against your neck, I don't care." He'd tried<br/>his phase-ability four separate times over the past day. Schuldich kept<br/>catching him, however, so he'd ended up just not bothering.<p>He felt the bed shift as Schuldich sat on the edge; still, he refrained<br/>from looking up. He did, however, tense as eh felt Schuldich pet his<br/>head and the back of his neck like he was some sort of house cat.<p>"You do go by a cat's name, 'Siberian'"<p>"Shut up and get out of my head."<p>The redhead smirked at the back of Ken's head, "Whatever you say,<br/>liebe." He did note that Ken had failed to tell him to remove his hand.<p>A giddy feeling bubbled in the pit of his stomach, the smirk fading<br/>into a goofy grin for a second. But only a second, as his face was<br/>quickly jerked back into his natural smirking expression.<p>-<p>This was the third building they'd checked. If Schuldich and Ken<br/>weren't here, there were still two more, although they were a good half<br/>hours run's from where they were. Weiss was getting tired, as was<br/>Ranko, and they _all_ knew that they were getting sloppy. Aya had<br/>accidentally kicked a can- something that wouldn't have happened<br/>normally.<p>The short "nap" after lunch had helped, but not enough. They were still<br/>falling asleep on their feet.<p>"Got it!" Ranko crowed suddenly, startling the boys. She was grinning<br/>in a way that was frighteningly similar to Farfello's, with her hand<br/>resting on the building's wall, "Either they're here, or there's<br/>another clue in here."<p>"Let's go," Omi gave a tired grin, "so we can go home and _sleep_!"<p>"Amen to that," Yohji muttered, tilting his shades onto his head. Aya<br/>said nothing, only going around the side of the building to search for<br/>an entrance. Normally, they'd fall back and plan everything out<br/>carefully, but this was Ken. They had to get him away from Schuldich<br/>_now_. Not tomorrow.<p>The other three followed Aya's lead, Omi being the one who eventually<br/>found an open entrance. They pulled themselves in through the window.<p>Below, a redheaded girl looked to be asleep in a computer chair. The<br/>aura stamp was hers, Ranko noted absently, before sending her sense out<br/>to search for Ken.<p>Schuldich's mental voice rang out, /Now, now, Bishoujo, you aren't<br/>about to cheat, are you?/<p>Aya growled low in his throat, forcing Ranko to realize that the<br/>message had not been directed solely at her. In fact, it had been<br/>directed at everyone, as the flame haired girl below bounced to her<br/>feet.<p>"They're here? Already?" they could hear her asking. He response was<br/>Schuldich stepping out of another room, and pointing up at them.<p>Taking her cue, Ranko flipped off the second floor to land on all<br/>fours. It would not have been impossible for her to land standing, but<br/>she didn't want to bother with feeding ki into her legs to soften the<br/>landing.<p>Aya followed her over the edge, while Yohji and Omi looked for a set of<br/>stairs. Four redheads stood in the warehouse- two male, two female.<br/>The unknown woman wasn't all that tall, and was probably only eighteen.<br/>Her hair was chin-length, and eyes a sharp emerald. She wore a black<br/>dress and stockings, a pale baby blue knit duster over top.<p>She muttered something to Schuldich in German, and he frowned. She<br/>repeated what she'd said, then moved to one side of the room. Aya's<br/>eyes were locked on Schuldich's but Ranko followed the girl curiously.<p>"Why are you following me?"<p>"Schuldich and Aya are glaring at each other," Ranko shrugged, "and I'm<br/>bored, and tired."<p>She got an odd look in return, but no words. The two girls only stopped<br/>once they were fully hidden by the shadows. A third shadow reached out<br/>to grab Ranko; she started to struggle, but the flash of a single<br/>golden eye halted her, "Jei-sama?"<p>"Will you come home, Kitty?"<p>"I..." Ranma _wanted_ to stay with Jei and never have to see Yohji or<br/>Omi again. On the other hand, there was still the mysteries of Fujimiya<br/>to figure out, "...I want to, Jei-sama, but..."<p>The other girl rolled her eyes at the melodrama, "You two are<br/>pathetic."<p>Farfello's warning growl was accompanied by Ranma's annoyed hiss.<p>Yohji and Omi had made it to the ground floor, and were backing Aya.<br/>This extra "incentive" made Schuldich falter for a moment- he was<br/>confident of his abilities to fight two of them, but three skilled<br/>assassins? Highly unlikely.<p>A mental call for help had Farfello and the girl running from their<br/>spots in the shadows. Jei had a knife in each hand, while the girl<br/>welded a wicked looking pole-arm; a two foot scimitar blade attacked to<br/>a three foot haft.<p>Ranma padded out as well, but she stayed out of any direct lighting.<br/>Instead, she moved towards the door Schuldich had entered the main room<br/>through.<p>-<p>Ken's head jerked up as the sounds of a fight came through the door.<br/>Weiss was here! The thought raced through his mind, and relief washed<br/>over him. No more being Schuldich's prisoner!<p>No more mind games.<p>The soccer player's cheeks developed quite the flush as he recalled the<br/>nature of Schuldich's "mind games". He wished for his bugnuks in that<br/>moment- simply to get rid of his embarrassment over the day with them.<br/>He hadn't expected them to drop into his lap. Looking up, Ranko stood<br/>in front of him.<p>He'd never been so happy to see someone in his life- he failed to<br/>realize what he was doing as he leapt off the bed to hug her. She'd<br/>seen the shackle around his wrist, however. She'd seen his arm pass<br/>through it.<p>"How'd you do that?"<p>"Do what?"<p>Ranko found it a _little_ annoying to have a taller, older boy wrapped<br/>around her neck, who was not standing on his own two feet. Glaring at<br/>him, she yanked his arms away from her neck, dropping him on the floor,<br/>"The thing with the chain! You went _through_ it!"<p>Ken's face paled. He hadn't even realized- merely reacted. He hadn't<br/>noticed the uncomfortable tingle as he phased through the shackle. His<br/>control was as strong as ever, that he knew, but the fact that he<br/>hadn't noticed the tiny lap... not good.<p>"I... uh..." Ken scratched the back of his neck, "I... can I tell you<br/>later?"<p>Ranko frowned, but conceded, "When we get back to the Koneko, you<br/>'splain what you just did. Now, let's go; I'm tired, and hungry."<p>-<p>They'd paired off- Schuldich and Omi, Aya and Farfello, the girl and<br/>Yohji.<p>While Aya and Farfello were well matched, and Schuldich and Omi hadn't<br/>had a victor yet, Yohji had taken on the girl with the long handled<br/>scimitar; and was winning. She obviously had not had much practice with<br/>the blade.<p>He looped his wire around the haft as he ducked away from the swing.<br/>With a sharp tug, and a slight twist, the weapon was out of her hands<br/>and skittering across the floor. A flash of fear darted across her face<br/>as she fell into a not-exactly great "sparring stance". Her left leg<br/>was forwards, both knees bent, although her left leg wasn't as far<br/>forwards as it was in the "normal" stance. She wobbled for a second<br/>before firming her stance, glaring at Yohji.<p>Lightly looping his wire around his fingers, Yohji gave his normal<br/>"play boy smirk." It didn't turn out the way he wanted it to, due to<br/>the stitches running from cheek to scalp. Her determined look did not<br/>waver for a second.<p>Yohji took a few steps forwards to lash out with a light kick to test<br/>her skill. She managed to dodge out of the way, but held back from<br/>counter attacking. Loosing his wire, he sent it flying at her, and she,<br/>once again, just barely kept from harm's way.<p>The next time he attacked, she didn't. The wire bit into her cheek and<br/>she gave a small yelp of pain. It was loud enough, however, for<br/>Schuldich to hear.<p>With a quick trick, the German had Omi asleep on the floor, and had<br/>appeared between Yohji and the girl. Jade eyes narrowed with anger.<p>"You alright, Rache[1]?"<p>"Just a nick, Schu," she grumbled, "I don't need you protecting me all<br/>the time."<p>Schu? Yohji only wondered on that for a second, before deciding that<br/>she was probably some whore he'd tricked into helping via a pretty<br/>face.<p>Said "pretty face" was suddenly in _his_ face, "You ever call my sister<br/>a whore, even in the privacy of your own mind, again, and I'll make the<br/>rest of your admittedly _short_ existence a living _hell_!"<p>"I'll help," Ranko's voice came from the left, and the trio whirled.<br/>She and Ken stood side-by-side, "But for now, you've lost oh Guilty<br/>One."<p>"For now," he agreed, drawing back, "See you later, Bishoujo." A pair<br/>of glares were sent in Yohji's direction before the siblings flitted<br/>off into the night.<p>Yohji padded over to where Omi lay, hefting the boy into the air,<br/>before turning to Aya. The redhead and Farfello stood across from one<br/>another, glaring, and panting heavily. Blood dripped from numerous cuts<br/>and abrasions dotting their skin.<p>Ranko slipped past the standing males to snag Jei's arm, and drag him<br/>off. Her voice was cheerful as three shocked gazes watched her leave,<br/>"Bye Guys! I'll see you later!"<p>Jei shot Aya a smug look before both vanished. Yohji blinked, then<br/>sighed, "Lets get home. Maybe we can figure out what happened, there."<p>"Yeah," Ken agreed, puzzling over the strange day. Maybe he'd figure<br/>out what Schuldich thought he was doing.<p>As the assassins left the warehouse, Yohji's voice was curious, "Ken?<br/>What happened top your clothes?"<p>-<p>Ten minute after they'd left, four people slipped back in- three<br/>males, one female. Ranma had changed back to normal and was currently<br/>pacing the ground beside his master. Blue eyes sharp from years upon<br/>years of attacks, scanned the room- although not for enemies. At<br/>least, not this time.<p>"...like they'd buy it, Rache," Schuldich had his hands in his pockets,<br/>"They'll just think this is a ploy to kill them."<p>"You're the one infatuated with Hidaka," Rache responded lightly, "Not<br/>me. I'm just trying to make my elder brother happy."<p>"No you're not," Ranma smirked, and Jei continued, "You just want him<br/>to stop 'mothering' you, Naru." The pair snicked at the dark look on<br/>the telepath's face, and Rache had to giggle as well.<p>"It's big," Jei gave Ranma a light, only slightly psychotic smile,<br/>"Lot's of room to play in." Over the days since meeting Kitty again,<br/>Jei had shown through Farfello's madness more and more. It was<br/>disturbing, however, to note that while Jei was _sane_, he shared much<br/>of Farfello's opinions, and grudges.<p>Schuldich hadn't bothered to look in on the lunatic's splintered mind,<br/>but he figured if he did, there was only one conclusion. Jei and<br/>Farfello were becoming one person again. Things would prove much<br/>more... fun, when they did.<p>"We'll have to purchase the building the way normal, law abiding<br/>citizens do," Rache stated, dropping back into her computer chair, "and<br/>it will take awhile to move all our things in here.<p>"Why's do we have to pay for it, Naru? We could just get Nagi to<br/>_make_ it ours," Jei looped his arms around Ranma's waist, as they came<br/>to a halt, chin resting on the shorter teen's shoulder, "This place has<br/>to be expensive!"<p>"Because," Rache rolled her eyes, "Crawford and Nagi are not to know<br/>about this place until we've completed the transition."<p>"And you four can break away from Estet," Ranma concluded, "besides,<br/>it's not like it's that expensive."<p>"You've never bought a warehouse before, have you, Bishoujo?" Schuldich<br/>hiked an eyebrow and dipped into Kitty's mind, to see exactly why the<br/>boy thought this way. With a note of surprise, he withdrew, "That's<br/>quite the sum of money you've got at your beak-and-call, _Sushi_."<p>"_You_ are Sushi?" Rache blinked, "Wow. You're pretty good, Ranma."<p>Ranma shrugged, "First, it's _Xue Shi_, as in chinese for bloodstone,<br/>_not_ 'Sushi'. And I had to earn money somehow. Nabiki takes a lot from<br/>me," and I still don't know how she gets it out of me, he grumped to<br/>himself, "In any case, Xue Shi can buy this place, and we can set it up<br/>over the next few days."<p>"Can't," Jei muttered, "Takatori is returning from Hawaii with some<br/>friend, tomorrow. It's back to playing bodyguards for him."<p>The female redhead made a face, "Then I guess it's just Ranma and me."<p>Ranma shook his head, however, "I'm going with Jei-sama, Naru. I've<br/>been so bored lately! The only person who's shown up is Ryouga- and<br/>P-chan gets lost to easily," Jei had growled int he back of his throat<br/>at Ryouga's nickname. The obsidian haired youth, however, failed to<br/>notice, "I get the feeling everything and everyone from Nerima is going<br/>to come crashing down on me, any minute now."<p>Rache sighed, "I'm going to be all alone! We can't expect Weiss to help<br/>me move in!"<p>Schuldich hiked an eyebrow, "Don't you have any friends?"<p>Rache ran her fingers through chin-length red hair, "I haven't spoken<br/>to most of them in four years- correction! _They_ haven't spoken to<br/>_me_!"<p>"Want we should include them in the hunt, Naru?" a positively blood<br/>thirsty look danced across Saotome's face. Rache lifted a hand.<p>"No. But keep that in mind."<p>End<p>[1] I am unsure if this is the right word. I read that it's German for<br/>"revenge".
