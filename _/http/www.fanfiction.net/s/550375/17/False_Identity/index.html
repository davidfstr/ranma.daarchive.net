</div>Pfft. I was listening to Saiyuki mp3s while typing this up. I was also<br/>_watching_ Saiyuki videos instead of writting this chapter, and that<br/>would explain why this is late _and_ why I did so poorly on my math<br/>"midterm"...<p>It's not taken at midterm, so why's it called a midterm?<p>Well, I can't remember who it was, but they wanted this, so I'm giving<br/>it to them *gringringrin*<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Sixteen: Changes<br/>Li Xiang<p>Ranko ran her fingers through her hair, entering the Koneko from the<br/>back entrance. It was still early, as she entered the kitchen, to the<br/>sight of Aya and Ken seated at the table.<p>"Morning," she called to them cheerfully, and they raised their heads.<br/>The solemn look on Aya's face was normal- the one on Ken's was not.<br/>Ranko frowned, "Something wrong?"<p>It was Ken who spoke, "Omi and Yohji called from the hospital. Nabiki's<br/>sister was nearly killed last night."<p>"But you already knew that," came Aya's monotone, "You were there, were<br/>you not, Ranma?"<p>"Whatever are you talking about," Damn. The Twit twins must have told<br/>them. Ranko found herself as _him_self. Ken dropped the glass of hot<br/>water he'd picked up from it's resting place near where his hand had been.<p>"Damn," Siberian muttered, "I thought I left this shit behind a long<br/>time ago..."<p>"Why did you keep this from us?" Farfello's words were coming back to<br/>Aya. 'She won't, but he will'. This, obviously, had been what the<br/>sociopath Irishman had meant. Ranma's eyes narrowed.<p>"Would _you_ tell everyone you've just met that _you_ had a<br/>sex-changing curse?"<p>"No," Aya conceded defeat after a moment, then scowled, "How did<br/>Farfello know?"<p>Ranma gave him a flat-eyed stare. Aya found himself, inexplicitly,<br/>blushing. It was a 'what kind of idiot _are_ you' stare. "Schuldich."<p>"Right in one, Abyssian!" the ebony-haired martial artist grinned<br/>widely. In a moment, the grin became a pout, "You're not going to kick<br/>me out, are you?"<p>Ken and Aya stared at the pouting sixteen year old, then at each other,<br/>Ken's stare was one of 'what should we do?'. Aya sighed and felt like<br/>sulking. Ranko- or rather, Ranma- was doing something to him. He<br/>didn't know what it was, only that it was happening, and he wasn't too<br/>sure if he didn't like it.<p>"No... we aren't kicking you out."<p>"Yay!" Ranma did the standard, 'Little Kid Happy Dance' before<br/>beginning a search of the cupboards, "I'm hungry!"<p>"You're always hungry," Ken muttered, watching the younger teen tear<br/>around the kitchen in search of the ever-elusive food. Aya shook his<br/>head, then stood up.<p>"We've still got work. Ranko- uh, Ranma... change back to female, when<br/>you've eaten. You're helping."<p>Ken, too, stood, and Ranma tried the attack that had always, _always_,<br/>worked on him. The dreaded Puppy-Dog Eyes. Aya _stared_ at the boy,<br/>before turning and exiting. Ranma turned to Ken, "How the hell did he<br/>do that? That one always gets me!"<p>"Aya's made of sterner stuff," Ken snorted, before following the Weiss<br/>leader out. Ranma was left in the kitchen alone, a bag of store-bought<br/>cookies in hand.<p>-<p>Ranma- Ranko?- twirled a pen around her fingers as she sat at the<br/>counter. It was midday, and with both Aya and Ken on lunch break- not<br/>to mention Omi and Yohji were still at Nerima District Hospital- the<br/>shop was all but empty. Life was boring. She wanted something to do.<p>"Ask and ye shall receive," came a familiar voice. Ranma looked<br/>up to find Schuldich and Rache standing in front of her. The two<br/>redheaded Germans were wearing identical grins. Rache hopped up on the<br/>counter.<p>"Schu said you let Jei kill your fiancée."<p>"Ex-fiancée," Ranma shrugged, "And she's alive, unfortunately. Clinging<br/>to life just barely, though. Kudou and Tsukiyono are with the<br/>Tendou family at the hospital."<p>Rache nodded, looking faintly relieved, then turned her gaze on the<br/>Koneko, "Nice place. To many plants for my tastes..."<p>"Still having problems with your landlord?"<p>She grinned, "At the moment, no. I played a trick on her last night."<p>"Kleine Schwester[1]..." Schuldich sighed, "Sometimes, Rache, you do<br/>the most despicable things."<p>She shrugged, then went through her duster's pockets. After a few<br/>minutes of searching, she gave a happy crow, lifting the plastic<br/>card into the air, "One credit card for one Xue Shi, less several<br/>million yen."<p>"So you bought the warehouse?"<p>"And furnishings," Schuldich snorted, "Rache decided she was going to<br/>make each room for a specific person. Made me go through all their<br/>minds to find out what they wanted- and believe me, breaking through<br/>Crawford's shields without him noticing is not the easiest thing to do<br/>in the world."<p>Ranma hiked a ruby eyebrow, "I'm going to guess on this.. Did you max<br/>out my card?"<p>Rache blushed, "Uhm... well... yes?"<p>Ranma had to sigh. She had expected that- Rache was a woman, after<br/>all, and therefore well verse in the habit of shopping. The martial<br/>artist tapped her pen against the counter, "Don't worry about it, Naru.<br/>In any case, when do you think Schwartz can move in?"<p>"A week, at least," Rache pulled her legs up to her chin, "While we've<br/>got electricity and running water, nothing else has been hooked up.<br/>Schu and I were wondering if you'd like to come help...?"<p>"Right now?" the cursed one frowned, "I'm kind of working..."<p>"The when Abyssian and Siberian return," Schuldich smirked, glancing at<br/>the door to the Koneko's living area, "You're coming with us."<p>Ranma pouted, "So I'm just unpaid muscle to you?"<p>"Un," Rache giggled, "Just a pack mule for us to burden with menial,<br/>physical labor." She patted the other girl on the head, patronizing<br/>smirk spreading across her features, as Ranma caught the offending hand.<p>"Schuldich!" the trio of redheads turned to see Ken standing in the<br/>door. The assassin felt suddenly uneasy as the German man's gaze fell<br/>on him. There was something in those jade eyes that creped him out.<p>Hidaka took a step back, before steeling his nerve. It was just a side<br/>effect of Schuldich's mind games. He _wasn't_ scared of him! The fact<br/>that Schuldich had suddenly smirked didn't really register- mostly due<br/>to the telepathic voice echoing in the back of his mind, /Definitely<br/>_not_ afraid of me, hmm...?/<p>Smirk firmly in place, Schuldich sidled up to his quarry's side.<br/>Rache- hand still in Ranma's grip- frowned, and the gender shifter<br/>snickered. Ken suddenly looked like a deer caught in the headlights.<br/>Schuldich had draped his arm over the teenager's shoulders, leaning<br/>close enough to breath into his ear.<p>No words made their way out of Schuldich's mouth, before Ken had shot<br/>away from him, and was hiding behind both counter and Ranma. The<br/>martial artist looked at the boy using her as a shield, "What _are_ you<br/>doing?"<p>Ken blinked a few times. He was... hiding behind Ranma as Schuldich<br/>padded forwards, pouting. Pouting? Why in the world was Schuldich<br/>_pouting_ at him?<p>"I think you made großer Bruder[2] upset," Rache snickered, "He looks<br/>about to cry!"<p>"Why are _you_ here?" Aya's chilling monotone cut through the air, and<br/>again, they looked up. His violet eyes were locked on Schuldich, but it<br/>was Rache who answered.<p>"Just returning Kitty's credit card," she shrugged, "and visiting."<p>Aya glared, and Ranma rolled her eyes, "Cool off, Aya. Or have you<br/>forgotten that only a few _days_ ago, you were goofing off with him in<br/>the park?"<p>Ken _stared_ at his leader. Apparently Omi and Yohji had failed to tell<br/>him what their leader had been doing the night of his kidnapping, "You<br/>were _what_?"<p>Aya had the grace to look ashamed, although it was offset a moment<br/>later via a sharp glare in Ranma's direction. The redhead gave him her<br/>'infuriating asshole' smirk, in return.<p>The sound of Aya's teeth grinding was almost loud enough to be heard in<br/>Eastern Canada.<p>Schuldich snickered a bit, folding hi hands behind his head and leaning<br/>on the counter, "Anyways, Katzchen, we're taking bishoujo to be our<br/>labour-slave for awhile."<p>Ranma made a face, "I'm no one's slave."<p>"Oh? Rache hiked an eyebrow, "You sure _act_ like Irish's slave."<p>"Whatever" Ranma snorted, flipping over the counter, and depriving Ken<br/>of his shield. The assassin 'eeped', ducking behind the counter, in an<br/>attempt to hide from his (German) redheaded tormentor. Kitty turned the<br/>'kawaii' factor on full, turning to face Aya. As she happened to be<br/>female at that moment, he had a smaller resistance to The Look, "Come<br/>with us? We could use some extra hands..."<p>"Aya, don't!" Ken whined from where he was hiding. Aya was frowning-<br/>since Ranma had let Jei maul Akane and injure Nabiki, their tentative<br/>contract with the middle Tendou had been voided. That meant he didn't<br/>have to watch over 'Ranko' anymore. However, Ranma was still _living_<br/>with Weiss, and therefore, capable of getting Schwartz hard copies of<br/>information. As well, this was a chance for Aya to find out where<br/>Schwartz lived.<p>Besides, he'd had fun when he was goofing around with Schuldich and<br/>Ranma. He hadn't had fun like that sine Aya-chan's accident.<p>His voice was still rather icy, although Ranma could swear she saw his<br/>eyes light up at the prospect, when he answered, "The Koneko won't run<br/>efficiently with just the two of us, Ken. We might as well go."<p>"B... but Aya!" Ken hopped to his feet, "It's probably a trap and...<br/>and..." Ken's voice trailed off as he was subjected to Ranma's<br/>Puppy-Dog eyes. Even though he _knew_ Ranma was in reality, _male_, the<br/>marital artist was, at least in this form, undeniably female at the<br/>moment. Many a man has tried to overpower the kawaii-girl puppy-dog<br/>look with sheer willpower. Many a man has failed.<p>Ken was no exception as he found himself facing the Puppy-Dog look at<br/>full power.<p>-<p>Yohji winced as he dropped into the chair, across from Omi. He was<br/>_really_ feeling the pain of duking it out with Ranma. Black and blue<br/>all over from the blows he'd been dealt, not to mention the broken arm<br/>he bore. His ribs _hadn't_ been cracked, thank-god, but they'd been<br/>close. Right now, they were taped with infinite care.<p>"Did you get a hold of them?"<p>The playboy shook his head, "Nothing. Either they're ignoring the<br/>phone- which I _doubt_ Ken would do- or they're not at the Koneko. I<br/>called Manx and asked if she could go over and check," he paused,<br/>"How's Akai or whatever her name is...?"<p>"Akane," came Nabiki's dull, lifeless voice, "is currently in intensive<br/>care. Despite all odds, she survived the night, but she'd in a coma."<p>The words of Tendou Soun's wailing suddenly made perfect sense.<p>-<p>Five hours of back breaking labor is a pair in the ass, Ranma growled<br/>to himself, stretching and popping his pine back in place. While he and<br/>Aya had ended up hauling boxes of shit around the warehouse, and in<br/>the process put an extreme amount of stress on their bones, Schuldich<br/>and Ken had been playing. The game had been, apparently,<br/>hide-and-go-seek, Ken was always hiding, and Schuldich always seeking.<p>Between her Barking of The Orders to "her slaves", Rache found the<br/>game absolutely hilarious.<p>Ken popped up from nowhere- only Ranma noting that he'd phased through<br/>a wall to escape Schuldich. His arms wrapped around Aya's legs, "Aya!<br/>Can we leave, yet?" he'd whined this question at every chance he got,<br/>but _this_ time he tagged something else on the end, "It's eight<br/>o'clock! C'mon!"<p>"Eight?" Ranma's face paled, "Have I been working for _seven_ hours?"<p>"Yeah," Rache's teasing grin vanished as Ranma began to curse- rather<br/>fluently- in English, Gaelic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Polish, Russian,<br/>German, French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese. Schuldich sidled up next<br/>to his sister.<p>"Don't be surprised. The swears are pretty much all he knows of most<br/>languages- he's been called all of them, after all."<p>"Schuldich!" Ranma pounced on the redhead and Aya felt an inexplicable<br/>surge of jealousy, "You've got a car, right? You can get me to Tamachi<br/>in twenty minutes, right?"<p>"What's the deal, Ranma?" Rache turned a curious eye on her ally, "Why<br/>Tamachi?"<p>"Xue Shi has a performance in twenty," he stated as way of explanation.<br/>The two German nodded in understand, but Ken and Aya were confused.<p>"I didn't figure you for a groupie," Ken muttered, eyeing Ranma.<br/>Groupies tended to dress in _normal_ clothing, not silk. The redheaded<br/>siblings wore matching smirks, and Ranma snorted.<p>"We can explain on the way if you want to come. Right now, we have to<br/>_go!_"<p>-<p>The band refused to play concerts. They _never_ played for anything<br/>large than a club. Akira was trying to fix that, but it was a hard job.<br/>It was quite literally, a miracle that he'd even convinced Xue Shi to<br/>record- and she kept finding ways to skip out on it. It was enough to<br/>make a manager rip out his hair.<p>And now, she was nowhere to be seen. Those who'd managed to get<br/>tickets to the gig were getting antsy. Xue Shi was ten minutes overdue.<br/>In the two years he'd been managing her and the bad, she had never been<br/>late to a gig. Practices, sure, but never a gig. He was biting his<br/>nails and praying to a god he doubted would listen, that a miracle<br/>would happen.<p>With a muffled wail of despair, he sent the band out. Hopefully a few<br/>minutes of grace would be bought as they set up.<p>Fei Li's fingers twitched on the strings of his bass guitar. His head<br/>was bowed, so silken black hair fell into his face, and hid the<br/>panicked look in his eyes. He'd always felt like the only reason the<br/>fans tolerated him was because of Xue Shi. He hated the feeling of<br/>being unwanted, and most of Xue Shi's fans made him feel like that.<p>Nobuyuki sat stiffly in his seat, the drumsticks twirling around deft<br/>fingers. The only hint of his nervousness was his bouncing leg, and the<br/>fact he was practically chewing through his bottom lip.<p>Oz didn't really look nervous. Although, that might have something to<br/>do with his eternal laid-back look. Some critics assumed he was stoned<br/>99% of the time. But Oz was nervous. The entire time he'd been in Japan<br/>had been spent playing guitar in one band or another, having only<br/>recently joined up with Xue Shi. And there had always, _always_ been a<br/>singer to take the attention off of him.<p>Oz didn't play so well when he thought everyone was watching him, and<br/>him alone.<p>His head snapped up as the overhead fans brought a familiar- and very<br/>welcome- scent to his nose. Sharp eyes peered out from under neon blue<br/>bangs, searching the crowd for a familiar head of blood red hair.<p>This wasn't so easy- a lot of Xue Shi's fans had dyed their hair red<br/>for the gig. He was searching for a particular shade when a hand shot<br/>out of the crowd. Around it were three other redheads- apparently<br/>natural, seeing as their eyebrows were red, too. One man had deep<br/>crimson hair, the other an orangish flame red, and a woman with a shade<br/>of red that looked to be only a few shades closer to brown. Xue Shi<br/>stood in front of them, and the brunette to her left looked...<br/>familiar, but Oz couldn't place him.<p>With a wild grin, Xue Shi used her fingers as a count down. Five...<br/>four... three... two... one...<p>Oz started the opening riff to "By Myself"<p>It was almost automatic for the boys to start in with him at their<br/>"proper" place. Xue Shi's voice rang out.<p>"What do I do to ignore them behind me?<br/>Do I/follow my instincts blindly?<br/>Do I hide my pride/from these bad dreams<br/>And give into sad thoughts that are maddening?"<p>The crowd seemed to turn in on itself, looking for Xue Shi- and she<br/>crouched, then pushed off, flipping over their heads to land elegantly<br/>on the stage, singing all the while.<p>"Do I/sit here and try to stand it?<br/>Or do I/try to catch them red handed?<br/>Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness<br/>or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?"<p>Xue Shi's grin split her face in half as she picked up the mike, and<br/>the nervousness seemed to flow out of her band-mates. Fei Li began to<br/>sing along with her.<p>"Because I can't hold on<br/>When I'm stretched so thin<br/>I make the right moves but I'm lost within<br/>I put on my daily facade but then<br/>I just end up getting hurt again<br/>By Myself"<p>Nobuyuki: Myself!<p>Xue Shi: I ask Why<br/>Oz: But in my Mind<br/>I find<br/>Xue Shi: I can't rely on myself!<p>Nobuyuki: Myself!<p>Xue Shi: I ask Why<br/>Oz: But in my Mind<br/>I find<br/>Xue Shi: I can't rely on myself!<p>Fei Li: I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To what I want when I'm stretched so thin<br/>Fei Li: It's all too much to take in<br/>I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To anything watching everything spin<br/>Fei Li: With thoughts of failure sinking in.<p>"If I/Turn my back I'm defenseless<br/>And to Go blindly seems senseless<br/>If I hide My pride and let it all go on<br/>Then they'll/take from me till everything is gone<br/>If I/let them go I'll be outdone<br/>But If I/try to catch them I'll be outrun."<p>"If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer<br/>Then I'll be buried in the Silence of the Answer"<p>Nobuyuki: Myself!<p>Xue Shi: I ask Why<br/>Oz: But in my Mind<br/>I find<br/>Xue Shi: I can't rely on myself!<p>Nobuyuki: Myself!<p>Xue Shi: I ask Why<br/>Oz: But in my Mind<br/>I find<br/>Xue Shi: I can't rely on myself!<p>Fei Li: I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To what I want when I'm stretched so thin<br/>Fei Li: It's all too much to take in<br/>I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To anything watching everything spin<br/>Fei Li: With thoughts of failure sinking in.<p>Fei Li, again, sung along with Xue Shi.<p>"How do you think/I've lost so much<br/>I'm so afraid/I'm out of touch<br/>How do you expect/I will know what to do<br/>When all I know/Is what you tell me to.<p>Don't you [Nobuyuki: Know!]<br/>I can't tell you how to make it [Nobuyuki: Go!]<br/>No matter what I do. How hard I [Nobuyuki: Try!]<br/>I can't seem to convince myself [Nobuyuki: Why!]<br/>I'm stuck on the outside.<p>Don't you [Nobuyuki: Know!]<br/>I can't tell you how to make it [Nobuyuki: Go!]<br/>No matter what I do. How hard I [Nobuyuki: Try!]<br/>I can't seem to convince myself [Nobuyuki: Why!]<br/>I'm stuck on the outside."<p>Fei Li: I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To what I want when I'm stretched so thin<br/>Fei Li: It's all too much to take in<br/>I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To anything watching everything spin<br/>Fei Li: With thoughts of failure sinking in.<p>Fei Li: I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To what I want when I'm stretched so thin<br/>Fei Li: It's all too much to take in<br/>I can't hold on<br/>Xue Shi: To anything watching everything spin<br/>Fei Li: With thoughts of failure sinking...<p>As the song came to a close, Xue Shi signaled for the band to quiet,<br/>"Sorry for the gig starting late. So... anyone up for some reaaaally<br/>sappy songs?"<p>There were a number of boos - Xue Shi normally didn't play<br/>that sort of music, and had quite often rebuffed such styles in the<br/>rare interviews she did- and one loud, derisive laugh. The martial<br/>artist-come-singer rolled her eyes, "I get it, I get it. Would the one<br/>who laughed, come here?"<p>Schuldich chuckled again, pushing others out of the way and making a<br/>show of it as he approached the stage. Rache, Aya and Ken followed at a<br/>more sedate pace, "Hello bishoujo."<p>"Schuldich..." she was smiling cheerfully, even as her leg snapped out<br/>to knock him in the chin. The German merely tipped his head to one<br/>side, and the kick simply stirred his hair, "... be a dear and keep<br/>your mouth shut."<p>"The sklave is giving _me_ orders now?"<p>Xue Shi had to laugh, "I belong to no one, Schuldich, you _know_ that!"<p>"You sure took orders well this afternoon," Rache smirked. Xue Shi was<br/>mature. She didn't stick her tongue out, or give Rache the red eye. The<br/>singer fingered the German girl.<p>Turning her attention back to the crowd in general, Xue Shi grinned,<br/>"Here's a new one for me...<br/>Tachidomatte'ru<br/>Kimi no senaka wa<br/>Sabishige na mama<br/>Boku wo toraeru<br/>Kimagure na ai de tsutsumitai<p>Shinjirarenai<br/>Kotoba bakari ga<br/>Egao no naka de<br/>Kiba wo muite'ru<br/>Sono kakera ni ai wo sagashite'ru<p>Itsuka wagamama na<br/>Utagoe ga kimi ni todoite<br/>Sonna shunkan ni<br/>Kono sekai wa kawatte yuku<p>Nani wo mitsukete yukou<br/>Jikan wo kirisaite<br/>Kimi no soba ni iru yo<br/>Sore ga yasashisa nara<p>Nani wo mitsumete iyou<br/>Sono te wo sashidashite<br/>Tsukanda genjitsu wo<br/>Let it go<br/>Shinjiyou<p>Tooku wo mite'ru<br/>Sono manazashi wa<br/>Kokoro no naka no<br/>Koe wo kiite'ru<br/>Mada aoi tsuki wo dakishimete<p>Hashiri tsudzukeru<br/>Kimi no tsuyosa ga<br/>Mata atarashii<br/>Tobira wo hiraku<br/>Sugu akeru yoru wo terashidase<p>Tatoe hitori demo<br/>Kimi no koto shinjite itai<br/>Sonna shunkan ni<br/>Kono sekai wa ugokidasu<p>Nani wo mitsukete yukou<br/>Kokoro wo hakidashite<br/>Mata koko deaeru yo<br/>Sore ga shinjitsu nara<p>Nani wo mitsumete iyou<br/>Sono te wo sashidashite<br/>Tsunkanda genjitsu wo<br/>Let it go<br/>Shinjiyou<p>Nani wo mitsukete yukou<br/>Jikan wo kirisaite<br/>Kimi no soba ni iru yo<br/>Sore ga yasashisa nara<p>Nani wo mitsumete iyou<br/>Sono te wo sashidashite<br/>Tsukanda genjitsu wo<br/>Let it go<br/>Shinjiyou..."<p>END<p>[1]Little Sister<br/>[2]Big Brother<br/>Big thanks to Aquila for the help with the German ^-^V<p>"By Myself" was the hardest part of the chapter.<p>The other song is "For Real" by Tokuyama Hidenori.
