</div>Like I said in the notes for fi19, here's the second chapter for the<br/>three chapters upload! Yay for you! I _was_ originally going to hold<br/>this one back for another week, but I decided that was just cruel. I<br/>might as well let you get all the False Identity Goodness you missed.<br/>Besides, that's how I work Legions (my comic). If I'm lost for a week<br/>or two, the comics from the missing dates go up with the current week's.<p>See, I'm not trying to just get out of doing chapters. I just happen to<br/>have a lot of computer problems that are a pain in the ass.<p>Besides, Dad wouldn't let me use his laptop to upload everything because<br/>he's an arse. (Dad: "It's my job!") Isn't my father mean? If I knew<br/>what his email was (er... what the email he actually checks was...) I'd<br/>post it so all of you could bug him into letting me upload stuff.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Twenty: Shots<br/>Li Xiang<p>Softly, she padded down the road, kimono whispering with her movements.<br/>It was late- past midnight- as she halted outside a small pet shop.<br/>The closed blinds slitted open after a few minutes, and a side door<br/>swung silently in, "About time you got here, Raven. Your client is<br/>waiting."<p>The woman gave an elegant shrug, "I had to finish my last client's<br/>job." She entered the pet shop and hiked a scarlet brow upon seeing her<br/>latest employer.<p>"Well, this _is_ a surprise, Cologne."<p>The old amazon turned to face the familiar voice. Shock registered<br/>across the elder's face, "The infamous Lady Assassin Raven..." Khu Lon<br/>muttered, "...is Saotome Nodoka?"<p>"Indeed."<p>-<p>Gulping in air, Ken skidded to a stop once within the warehouse. He'd<br/>been running so hard, so fast, that he had to twist around, slamming<br/>his back into the wall to halt himself. His sharp cry of pain- mingled<br/>with that of his burden's- brought Rache running.<p>"Ken! What's wrong?"<p>"Ranma..." Ken wheezed, "... gotta heal... Ranma...!"<p>It took less than a glance to understand Ken's panic. With a simple<br/>command, Rache had Ken take Ranma into the younger boy's room. Setting<br/>him carefully on the bed, the young healer began to heal his wounds,<br/>one by one. Starting with the major wounds- where she'd take out one<br/>of the knives, then force her power into the bleeding gash- she made<br/>her way painstakingly over the sixteen year old's body.<p>She got through the majority of the most serious wounds before<br/>collapsing. She'd done to much healing that day, and had passed out<br/>halfway through healing the last of the wounds that required blade<br/>removal.<p>Sighing, Ken lifted Rache's small, light frame, setting her on Ranma's<br/>bed as he began to bandage the boy's wounds. Tired and aching as he was<br/>from his sprint, the Hidaka male was _not_ about to let his<br/>sorta-friend bleed to death.<p>Ranma's clothes were ruined- not only had Muu Tzu's weapons managed to<br/>rip them to shreds, that first phasing had all but made the boy naked.<br/>The unconscious youth had been stripped out of the remains to be<br/>healed- the seriousness of the wounds preventing any attempts at<br/>modesty by either Ken or Rache. To be honest, neither had really<br/>noticed in their frantic attempts to save the young martial artist's<br/>life. The shreds of clothing that remained were pilled haphazardly in a<br/>corner.<p>It was those pieces of silk that Ken used to bind Ranma's wounds, the<br/>multitudes of bloody scrapes and cuts cleaned with alcohol- why did<br/>Rache have alcohol on her?- washed clear with water, then tightly<br/>wrapped. After an hour and a half of labour, Ken lifted Ranma up onto<br/>his bed.<p>Once the teenager was carefully set down, Ken again picked up Rache,<br/>and headed to the only other room in the warehouse with lights on. He<br/>kicked Ranma's door shut, hitting the light switch with his elbow as he<br/>left.<p>Had he stayed but one minute longer, he would have seen something truly<br/>amazing. Ranma's body began to heal itself- at a very accelerated<br/>rate. Smoke seemed to waft out of his bandaged wounds, running over his<br/>skin like a mother's gentle fingers. And his injuries began to seal<br/>themselves...<p>-<p>The wood was rough beneath the tender pads of his paws- feet, the<br/>human side whispered, and hands- grains sticking and cutting, leaving<br/>a number of blood splatters on the fence as he walked it. The chain<br/>looped about his neck tightened, tugging him forwards.<p>Ebon hair danced in his stormy eyes, obscuring scant fractions of sight<br/>for mere moments before moving on.<p>Kitty paced the fence alongside his human companion on the road. A<br/>flash of annoyance at being treated like some sort of possession washed<br/>over him before vanishing. Jei was feeding him- a spell of good luck.<br/>Despite his unmatchable speed, Kitty wasn't all that great of a<br/>hunter- he _was_ still a kitten, after all- and had been barely<br/>eating before Jei had found him.<p>A shriek split the air, and both boys looked up. Only a few feet away<br/>from them was Jei's mother, staring at her son in shock.<p>"I _thought_" she practically bellowed, "I told you to stay away from<br/>that riff-raff wild child!"<p>"He's my pet," Jei grumped, "He _listens_ to me!"<p>"Listens? LISTENS? Jei! Get _away_ from that- that- that trash!"<p>Kitty's hackles rose, lips curling back from his teeth. Jei had dropped<br/>the chain to get into a screaming match with his mother. A distinctly<br/>feline yowl was issued forth from his lips, as Kitty launched himself<br/>at the woman.<p>She wasn't going to take away his food provider!<p>Jei barely managed to scramble out of the way as Kitty attacked, eyes<br/>flashing. His mother shrieked again, swinging her purse around in a<br/>desperate attempt to save herself. The impromptu weapon cracked Kitty<br/>across the base of his skull, sending roaring tremors of pain<br/>throughout him.<p>-<p>Saotome Nodoka watched Khu Lon through narrowed eyes, lifting her tea<br/>cup to her lips once again. For the last hour or so, she and the old<br/>amazon had been secreted away in the basement of the pet shop.<p>In a round about way, Khu Lon had been asking questions about Ranma. A<br/>mother _always_ knew when she was being questioned about her child, and<br/>there was no doubt that, that was what Khu Lon as attempting. She also<br/>knew there was a reason behind the ancient woman to have come looking<br/>for "Raven"- and it had yet to come up.<p>Finally, the younger woman's patience was worn through, "As much as I<br/>appreciate you catching me up on the gossip in Nerima, but there is a<br/>reason you were searching Raven out, was there not?"<p>"...yes," Nodoka noted Khu Lon's slight hesitation before answering,<br/>but neither changed expression or said a word. The old woman was up to<br/>something- the Saotome Matriarch recognized the gleam in her eyes,<br/>"There is something I must tell you first, however, so that you should<br/>understand my view."<p>Something to do with either Ranma or Genma, then. Had it been anyone<br/>else, she mused, then Khu Lon would not have hesitated. It is not in<br/>her character, "Then do tell."<p>"I know of the Seppeku Pact," who didn't? "And your reasons behind it.<br/>I... must tell you that Ranma is not only _failing_ in his duties as a<br/>'manly man'- he is actively attempting to destroy any chance of doing<br/>so!"<p>"Explain," the ice in Nodoka's voice made Khu Lon crow with success-<br/>on the inside, of course. Nodoka was almost within her grasp.<p>"Three nights ago, Ranma reappeared at the Tendou Dojo after almost a<br/>week of his latest disappearing act. With him came a man impervious to<br/>pain, and together they took out Akane, Nabiki and another young man."<p>"What of Akane and Nabiki?"<p>"Nabiki will walk with a limp for the rest of her life. Akane is in a<br/>coma. Worse yet, the following morning the nerveless man appeared at<br/>the Nekohanton, screaming of revenge on those who would steal 'his<br/>Kitty'."<p>"Ranma."<p>"Yes," Khu Lon nodded slowly, "your son arrived on the scene not to<br/>long after that- and prevented me from rescuing my great<br/>granddaughter. Your son allowed Xian Phu to be killed! Is that _not_ a<br/>violation of his man-amongst-men pact? To kill a woman?"<p>Nodoka was frowning out right now, and Khu Lon jumped at the chance to<br/>reinforce her point, "Should he not have to pay with his own life? An<br/>eye for an eye...?"<p>Nodoka stood, setting her empty teacup on the table, "An eye for an<br/>eye, Khu Lon? What you suggest... would mean _I_ would have to die as<br/>well, would it not? I _am_ an assassin."<p>"Are you saying that you're going back on a pact of _honor_?" Khu Lon<br/>knew _damn_ well that both Ranma and his mother were hooked on honor.<br/>The seppaku pledge was her only way to force Nodoka's hand- and<br/>killing a woman was not _manly_, especially, the wold woman thought,<br/>for a woman who based her standards of manly on _Happosei_.<p>A cruel smile made its way across Nodoka's face, before vanishing<br/>beneath an artfully emotionless mask, "I'm afraid, Khu Lon, that you<br/>'ve misunderstood me. The seppeku pledge... well, if one were to look<br/>closely, one would note that there are exemptions."<p>"Exceptions?" Khu Lon slipped one hand into her sleeve, hiking an<br/>eyebrow.<p>"Yes," Nodoka started for the door, "You see, if Ranma was to follow in<br/>my footsteps, he would _have_ to take out a woman, in time[1]. There<br/>are other exemptions, but those you need not know."<p>"Such a shame," Khu Lon mused, pulling her hand free from her sleeve,<br/>having drawn a 9mm from it's holster. The gun looked large compared to<br/>her diminutive frame, "that you would not see reason and do this for<br/>me. However, now that you have the chance to tell your son my plan, I'm<br/>afraid... you're expendable."<p>"What-" was all Nodoka got out as she began to turn to face the elder.<br/>The gun was not silenced, and therefore _very_ loud when it rang out.<br/>The slight turn of her body made the bullet miss her heart- the<br/>elder's target- but it still hit.<p>A scream of pain rent the air.<p>-<p>"NO!"<p>Ranma sat bolt up, flipping to his feet in a single, fluid movement. He<br/>stumbled a step, the bandages tight on corded muscle, and the last of<br/>the smoke that curled over his body dissipated. Snarling, he ripped the<br/>tight bandages from his chest and thighs, either uncaring, or unseeing<br/>of the red and black silk wrapped around his shins and arms.<p>Stormy blue eyes flared in the darkness, his breath coming in rapid<br/>gasps. Muscles tensed and relaxed in the mimic of a whirlwind. Like a<br/>raging storm held barely at bay, Ranma paced the room, keen eyes<br/>glaring out in search of clothing.<p>Seeing none, Kitty grabbed the bed sheet negligently ripping a hole in<br/>the middle and sliding the fabric over his head like a poncho. As he<br/>did this, Ken flew in through the door, "Ranma! What are you-"<p>"Out. Of. My. Way." Ranma snarled, his aura almost flaring into the<br/>visible spectrum- power dancing in blue eyes. Automatically, Ken moved<br/>to one side, and Ranma stalked past.<p>"What's going on? Why'd you scream? What... what happened to all your<br/>injuries?"<p>"Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, doesn't matter," Ranma replied, before<br/>throwing open the door and leaping to the roof of the next building<br/>over. Ken gaped at Ranma's long distance standing jump.<p>As the martial artist ran into the night, he growled lowly, "Hang on<br/>mama..." he didn't know why her aura flared suddenly in his senses-<br/>but the rapid drop of power could only mean one thing...<p>... Nodoka was on her way to dying.<p>-<p>Upon tucking the disgusting "modern" weapon back into her sleeve, Khu<br/>Lon stepped over Nodoka's body, walking out the entrance before the<br/>store's owner could come racing into the basement from his own room.<br/>Nodoka would not be talking anytime soon.<p>She vanished into the darkness.<p>Only moments later, Mugoh Kojiro barreled down the stairs, throwing<br/>open the basement doors to find his favorite operative soaking her<br/>kimono in her own blood. Khu Lon had known the moment the bullet went<br/>off, she'd have to leave- quickly- and hadn't bothered to check to<br/>see that she'd hit where she'd meant to.<p>Nodoka had pushed herself up, but she didn't look like she'd be able to<br/>hold herself up. Kojiro knew she'd been shot before- only the want to<br/>see her only son again had kept her alive, then. But he knew she'd<br/>found the elusive boy and his father. He _didn't_ know if she'd want to<br/>live to see her grandkids.<p>"C'mon Raven, my No-chan," he grunted, hefting her into his arms, "this<br/>is no place to die."<p>Nodoka shrugged slightly, hissing with pain as she did so- even _that_<br/>minimal movement sent waves of agony through her body. Kojiro struggled<br/>to get her over to the basement's couch. Blood was beginning to soak<br/>into his skin when he finally got her comfortable.<p>Grunting and popping his back, Kojiro brushed red bangs out of her<br/>face, "Sit tight," he whispered, "I'll be right back..."<p>Bolting for the stairs, Kojiro shot through the pet shop and up into<br/>his living quarters. Panic bubbled in his chest- he _couldn't_ let<br/>Nodoka die... he'd hate himself for it.<p>As he came out of the bathroom, there came a noise. It was far from<br/>soft- it was the sound of someone forcing open the metal gates that<br/>covered the display windows. Kojiro flew down the stairs, only to see<br/>someone wearing what appeared to be a white poncho disappearing down<br/>the stairwell to the basement.<p>Gritting his teeth- and checking to make sure his favorite Bowie knife<br/>was still in it's place- Kojiro paced silently down the stairs. When<br/>he pushed open the door to the basement, he froze.<p>A teenaged boy was kneeling beside Nodoka. What he'd thought a poncho<br/>was nothing more than a sheet with a hole through it for his head. Ebon<br/>hair- loose, but not free; it was blood caked, much like Nodoka's<br/>clothing- flowed down his back to the bottoms of his shoulder blades.<p>"Who did this?" the boy hissed, turning his head so one luminescent<br/>blue eye was on Kojiro," Who dared to hurt my mother?"<p>_This_ was Ranma? Kojiro scowled, "How did you know she was here?"<p>Ranma snorted, "I'm a martial artist," as thought i explained<br/>everything. It didn't, and at Kojiro's blank expression, he scowled<br/>just as darkly as the older man had, "I sensed her battle aura peak,<br/>then fall rapidly. I traced it here."<p>That didn't do much better, but Kojiro didn't want Nodoka to die while<br/>Ranma's explained. The black haired man brought the first aid kit he'd<br/>grabbed as Ranma knit his finger though his mother's.<p>Kojiro began to speak, knowing, somehow, deep in his bones, that if he<br/>didn't explain, Ranma might do something rash. It was already going to<br/>cost him a lot of yen to replace the pet shop gates.<p>"No-chan." Ranma cast him a look at the nickname- Kojiro didn't see<br/>it, "always asks to be alone with her clients-"<p>"Clients?"<p>"You don't know what your mother's job is?"<p>"Never thought to ask," Ranma's eyes flared suddenly, pure, glaring<br/>white energy sparking from them, "Continue. So I know who to kill."<p>"You're a lot like your mother," Kojiro muttered, now positive that<br/>this was, indeed, Saotome Ranma, "Any ways, No-chan knew the client<br/>this time- some old woman- and they came down here for tea and talk.<br/>I don't know what happened, I was upstairs, but someone shot a gun. The<br/>old woman was gone, and No-chan bleeding to death."<p>"What about a hospital?" Old woman...?<p>"No time," Kojiro ran his fingers through Nodoka's hair, licking his<br/>dry, chapped lips, "She's almost gone, now. Lost to much blood."<p>Ranma snorted, "Coulda said the same about me about two hours ago...<br/>now, how did Naru do that trick?"<p>The ebon haired martial artist was so busy staring into space,<br/>wondering, that he never noticed the black smoke seeping from beneath<br/>his bandages- Kojiro, however, did.<p>"What the...?"<p>Blinking, the martial artist looked over at the older man, then<br/>followed Mugoh's gaze to his arms. The smoke grew stronger under<br/>Ranma's own gaze, becoming almost a shadow as it wafted into the air.<br/>When whatever it was dove for Nodoka, both males gave a cry of alarm.<p>-<p>"So he's not with you?"<p>"No," was Aya's terse reply, and Ken winced. Ranma was nowhere to be<br/>seen- nowhere to found. And Ken did _not_ want to reach out to the<br/>only way he'd be able to find him.<p>"Alright, thanks Aya. Call me if he shows up there?"<p>"Fine," and the phone went dead. Ken stared at the receiver, blinking.<br/>Slowly, he set it back into it's cradle, biting his lip. He _really_<br/>did _not_ want to do this.<p>Tentatively, he called out, within his own mind.<p>/Schuldich?/<p>The speed at which he was answered, startled him. The response,<br/>however, explained _why_.<p>/Bishoujo's gone rouge, and you want to know where he is, eh Lieber?/<br/>Obviously, Schuldich had already been tucked away in the back of his<br/>mind. Growling a bit, Ken managed to snap back, half civilly, /No duh.<br/>Where's Ranma?/<p>The mental equivalent of a shrug was imposed upon Ken, /Not to sure. I<br/>suppose I should track him down, then, Lieber?/<p>Ken didn't dignify Schuldich with an answer, and the German pulled out<br/>from the Weiss boy's mind. Less than ten minutes later, Schuldich's<br/>presence flooded his mind. Ken jerked in surprise, almost dropping the<br/>glass of water he'd pulled from Ranma's fridge.<p>/Ranma's mind is... panicked/ Schuldich sounded hesitant, /I wouldn't<br/>go near him til he's cooled down a bit.../<p>/What _aren't_ you telling me?/<p>A lot, Schuldich mused to himself, /Ranma... eh, his mom's in trouble,<br/>he's pissed. That's all I could get from him. His mind's a trap for the<br/>unwary, Kenken./<p>End<p>[1] This is called foreshadowing. Hell, it's practically telling you<br/>who the woman is, right there, hehehehehehehe<p>I just realised that prereading my own work is really, really, stupid.<br/>*sniffles* I want my prereader back! But Yanslana's on vacation...
