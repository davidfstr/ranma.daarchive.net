</div>An apology to all my readers:<p>I'm sorry I took so long in getting this out. If you must know,<br/>Eighteen is also complete, and that will be going up next week, as I<br/>still need a little leeway to finish chapter nineteen within two<br/>weeks. Now, for the reasons behind my non-updating...<p>...well, it's kinda hard to update when you don't have a computer<br/>connected to the internet. My computer's been on the fritz for the<br/>last month or so (interestingly, that's when the warrenty ran out...),<br/>and it finally just stopped working about two weeks ago. I got it back<br/>from the shop last night (Saturday, June 08) and have been trying to<br/>catch up on the four roleplay games I'm in, not to mention Legions (my<br/>comic), and trying to complete the creeping update of the StoryTeller.<p>That said, hopefully things will cool off soon, as this is my last<br/>week of classes, before exams, and I can do some serious<br/>not-so-quality writting. At least, when compared to really, really,<br/>really awesome writers, who are not me. (I will admit I write good, I<br/>just atribute it to my prereaders who are most awesome in their job.)<p>I've babbled enough. On to the story!<p>...Oh, yeah, anyone else wanna preread for me? Prereaders are gods,<br/>and besides, I need one 'cause mine's gone on vacation for the next<br/>couple months...<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Seventeen: Healing<br/>Li Xiang<p>Khu Lon stood on her staff, staring into the face of her great<br/>granddaughter. The girl was out cold, and looked so frail, with all<br/>the tubes and wires coming from her. The girl's neck was bandaged-<br/>thank the goddess that Jei had missed the arteries. But Xian Phu was<br/>all but useless now.<p>She'd live, but she would be forever mute. Jei had cut her vocal<br/>cords.<p>The old woman sighed heavily, then turned to leave the unconscious<br/>girl in the bed. She'd tell the nurses who should be contacted for<br/>Xian Phu's care on the way out.<p>For now, she had to find Muu Tzu. Xian Phu's death - in the eyes of<br/>the tribe- would be avenged. Jei would die, as would all those who<br/>stood with him.<p>Including Ranma.[1]<p>-<p>Yohji blinked his tired eyes as the door to the Koneko slammed shut.<br/>When he and Omi had returned- leaving the Tendou's alone in the<br/>hospital- they found the Koneko empty. Dishes from lunch on<br/>the counter, unwashed, and several flower arrangements incomplete.<br/>Omi had gone to his room to sleep, but Yohji had remained awake to<br/>wait for his teammates. He'd fallen asleep sometime around one.<p>Three figures entered the kitchen, upon noticing the light. Aya<br/>looked as awake as ever, Ken was ambling along sleepily, yawning<br/>and...<p>"What is _he_ doing here?"<p>Ken got the most adorably cute, sleepily confused look on his face.<br/>It was wasted because Aya and Yohji were in a staring contest, and<br/>Ranma-onna was raiding the cupboards again. Shaking his head, Siberian<br/>ambled off to go to sleep. Hopefully, in the morning, everything<br/>would make sense.<p>"Ranko... er Ranma, is living here until his home is finished."<p>"Dammit Aya! He broke my arm! Almost broke my ribs!"<p>Ranma snorted, "Personally, you deserved it. But if you're going to<br/>bitch and moan over it, Naru can fix the damn thing." Yohji and Aya<br/>shared a brief 'huh?', and Ranma explained further, "Naru's talent.<br/>She can heal anything alive. S'why her parents put her up for<br/>adoption."<p>Aya frowned, "And Schuldich...?"<p>"When his power matured, he was just kicked out," Ranma shrugged, "At<br/>least, that's what he told me."<p>"Whoa, hold it!" Yohji made a time-out sign with his cast, "Since<br/>when are _you_ buddy-buddy with Schwartz, Aya? I thought you hated<br/>them!"<p>The redhead paused for a moment, then shrugged, "I still do." Just<br/>not as much, was left out of the equation. Ranma gave a snort,<br/>pushing past the older men, and headed towards the bathroom. She'd<br/>like to sleep as a man, for once.<p>Yohji snagged Ranma's sleeve and the currently female martial artist<br/>debated braking his uninjured arm, "This Naru... can she heal my<br/>arm?"<p>"Didn't I say that?"<p>"I meant _now_, Saotome."<p>Ranma snorted, "It's three a.m., Kudou. Naru's sleeping. Get a clue,<br/>moron."<p>-<p>Rache actually _hadn't_ made it to bed yet. Yawning, the young woman<br/>finished shoveling her belongings into a pack similar from Ranma's.<br/>When she'd returned from the gig, she'd found an eviction notice<br/>tacked to the door.<p>Apparently, Kino hadn't liked being awoken at two in the morning<br/>because her bathroom had flooded.<p>The German would have been terribly panicked- had she not had the<br/>warehouse set up for at least _one_ person. All she had to do was<br/>move her things into her room at the warehouse. Another yawn slipped<br/>out, and she shouldered her bag.<p>Aside from her, the small apartment was empty. Rache _knew_ that by<br/>the same time the next day, the apartment would have new tenants.<p>-<p>Kitty clawed at the collar around his neck, only to feel the sharp<br/>'SMACK' of a stick hitting his forearms.<p>Jei held a chain in one hand, a stick in the other as he paraded<br/>Kitty around the larger Farmer's field near his home. He still didn't<br/>trust Kitty not to attack him, so he was training the eight year old.<p>Jei could still feel the crack of his father's leather belt on his<br/>backside as he did wrong. The sharp crack of his mother's wooden<br/>spoons on his hands as he tried to steal food from dinner... he'd<br/>been taught by being hurt when he did wrong. He'd teach Kitty the<br/>exact same way.<p>It had been a day and a half since he'd let Kitty out of the<br/>box/cage. While still rather independent, Kitty learned very quickly<br/>quickly. He'd already learned that if he didn't want to get hit, he<br/>had to listen to Jei.<p>The pale-haired child tugged the chain, leading Kitty out of the<br/>field. He wanted to see if Kitty would fully obey him, and the<br/>easiest way would be taking him back into the town. If Kitty didn't<br/>obey him there, it was back to the field to be retrained.<p>He didn't drop the stick, merely switching his grip so he held it<br/>like a walking staff. Kitty followed, head held up proudly at his<br/>side.<p>-<p>Ranma stretched, popping his spine as he did so. His muscles hurt-<br/>both from the labor he'd performed, as well as the acrobatics during<br/>the gig. Rolling his shoulders, the martial artist padded down into<br/>Weiss' meeting room.<p>Once again, the furniture was moved out of the way, and he began his<br/>kata.<p>Twenty minutes into his warm-up, Yohji came pounding down the stairs,<br/>wincing slightly as his cast bounced against his bruised ribs.<p>"Rank...ma!"<p>He didn't stop, "What do you want, Kudou?"<p>"I want my arm fixed!" the playboy scowled at Ranma's chuckle.<p>"How do you expect me to do that?"<p>Yohji glared at the martial artist as he bounced around the room,<br/>"Your friend. She can fix my arm!"<p>The martial art gender-bender gave a bark of laughter, coming to a<br/>stop in front of the eldest of Weiss, "Not if you're going to<br/>_demand_ I take you to her. I don't respond well to commands."<p>Yohji gave him a dirty look, opening his mouth to do just that-<br/>demand- when a thought struck him. He smirked, "If you take me to<br/>see this friend of yours... I'll buy you dinner."<p>A wide, rather evil grin spread across Ranma's face, "You've got<br/>yourself a deal, Kudou."<p>-<p>"Isn't this where Schuldich was holding Ken?"<p>"Yes," Ranma glared at the playboy. How did he get stuck with this<br/>moron again? Oh yeah, the promise of food, "Now, shut up, or I'll<br/>break your working arm, got it?"<p>A dirty look was the response, and Ranma shoved open the warehouse<br/>doors, "I don't know where she lives but... NARU! NARU, YOU IN<br/>HERE?"<p>"Fuck," came a groan, and the two men were treated to the sight of a<br/>blurry-eyed Rache trudging out of her room- the only one furnished.<br/>She gave them both angry glares, "Couldn't you have picked a better<br/>time to come see me then at ten in the morning? I was up all<br/>night!"<p>"Whatever," Ranma shrugged with a cocky grin, "The playboy here has<br/>been bitching about me breaking his arm, so I told him you'd heal it."<p>"... why did you do _that_?"<p>"Because he was complaining!" Ranma threw his hands up into the air,<br/>"_I_ never complained about it hurting when _I_ broke a bone or ten!"<p>"You've also been tortured by your father for longer than you can<br/>remember," Rache's response was dry. She snagged Yohji by his<br/>uninjured wrist, pulling him into the warehouse, "I'm not going to<br/>heal you in broad daylight," she explained tiredly as he made to<br/>resist.<p>Ranma snorted, "_I'm_ going to find something _fun_ to do. Later Naru."<p>"Bye Ranma."<p>The ebony-haired martial artist vanished, once again utilizing the<br/>Umi Sen Ken. Neither Yohji nor Rache noticed. The German teenager<br/>located one of the empty rooms- well, empty for all except a bed,<br/>dresser, lights and a phone- and dragged Yohji in.<p>"You might feel tired after this- I know I will- manipulating<br/>someone's ki to speed the healing process is a pain in the ass. Very<br/>tiring, and it's very easy to get lost in the patterns," Rache yawned<br/>slightly, "It doesn't help that I'm still half asleep. It won't<br/>affect the outcome, but it will make me pretty much drop off<br/>immediately."<p>Yohji gave a slight nod- he didn't _really_ understand anything<br/>except that they'd be tired by the end of whatever she was about to<br/>do. For a moment he wondered if he should trust, just not only the<br/>sister of a member of Schwartz, but a friend of that lunatic Ranma's,<br/>then pushed the thought away. Besides this "Naru" was kind of cute.<br/>And eighteen.<p>Rache shoved him, and he fell onto the bed. Crawling up on kneel<br/>beside him, Rache settled her hands on his arm- one on the cast, one<br/>above it in the crook of his arm.<p>Emerald eyes shut; she focused her mind on locating the break<br/>and fixing it. Fingers brushed over a cast already deluged with<br/>signatures, before stopping over the actual place of the break. A<br/>white glow danced around her hands, flicking off her fingertips like<br/>tiny bolts of lightning.<p>The energy began to flow faster, suffusing the cast with ambient<br/>light. Her lips curled into a snarl as she fought with Yohji's ki<br/>patterns to bring the needed healing energy to his wound from the<br/>rest of his body.<p>After nearly ten minutes, Rache collapsed out right, almost asleep as<br/>she muttered, "Didn't finish..." the German girl curled up there-<br/>half on, half off Yohji- and feel into slumber. He, too, felt the<br/>siren song of sleep as the ki that had been forced into his arm flood<br/>back into it's normal flows throughout his body.<p>He gave a yawn, unconsciously draping an arm over Rache and letting<br/>his fingers curl in shoulder length red locks. His eyes slid shut and<br/>he too, drifted into sleep.<p>-<p>Despite having been cloaked, water still found him. The formerly male<br/>martial artist sighed, pulling her aura even closer to herself than<br/>it had been. Xue Shi _was_ and idol singer, after all.<p>That reminded her- she still had an appointment with Akira to make a<br/>CD. She gave a small chuckle at that. Akira was let a chuckle free at<br/>that. Akira was obsessed with making her world famous.<p>It took another twenty minutes, but she managed to roof-hop to the<br/>band's collective apartment. Dropping the Umi-Sen-Ken, she hung<br/>upside down to knock on the window.<p>After a few minutes, the window slid open, and Fei Li blinked at his<br/>guest, "Sushi?"<p>She rapped her knuckles on his forehead in irritation, "Lemme in,<br/>Dumbass."<p>At least she didn't call me Wu Fei, he thought, stepping out of the<br/>way to allow the singer/martial artist into the apartment, "So, why<br/>are you here, Xue Shi?"<p>"I figured I might as well get that recording out of the way."<p>"Really?" Akira had thrown the door open, barging in with a<br/>fanatical look in his eye. Sweatdropping, Xue Shi nodded slowly. A<br/>split second later, she found herself, and the band, being shoved out<br/>the door. All the while, Akira was babbling cheerfully about already<br/>having the instrumentals done, and all they had to do was sing.<p>-<p>Nabiki stalked into the Koneko no Sumi Ie, fury blazing in her eyes.<br/>The sight was thrown off because she was limping slightly, leg<br/>bandaged, and leaning on a crutch to support her weight.<p>Her eyes locked on a certain redheaded man, and she grit her teeth,<br/>"Where is that bastard?"<p>Cool violet eyes stared her down from beneath a wild fringe of ruby<br/>bangs, before the man turned away, "If you're not buying something,<br/>leave."<p>"You must be Aya, then," the seventeen-year-old muttered, then<br/>snapped out, "Where the hell is Ranma?"<p>Aya opened his mouth to tell her he didn't know when a thought struck<br/>him. A rare look of mischief crossed his face, lighting his eyes,<br/>"Elsewhere.[2]"<p>"Omi didn't say you were a smartass," she growled, "Where's Ranma?"<p>"I don't know," Aya's icy glare made her stumble back a step, "He and<br/>Yohji took off over an hour ago. If you're not going to by<br/>something... _leave_."<p>Glaring, the injured girl crossed her arms, "I'm waiting here until<br/>he comes back." Ooooh, he was going to _pay_ for allowing Akane to be<br/>hurt. Family or not, Ranma had _no_ right to just stand there<br/>watching Akane practically get murdered.<p>-<p>Ranma-onna was pouring water down her throat... it was so sore...<p>Damn Akira, she growled to herself, make me sing over and over again.<br/>Well, at least it's over.<p>For today, came her snickering, evil inner voice. There were still a<br/>few songs left to "perfect" as Akira had wanted. It had to be nine at<br/>night now, "I'm off."<p>"Where you going?" Nobuyuki looked like he wanted to find the nearest<br/>keg and just guzzle it.<p>Ranma smirked, "Have to go pick up a moron I'm living with. He's with<br/>Naru."<p>"Naru?"<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, "Are you on something? Naru's the girl who<br/>came to the gig with me last night."<p>"Oh... her! Now I remember!"<p>Fei Li leaned over to whisper in Oz's ear, "Betcha 600 yen he<br/>doesn't."<p>"I'm not taking a loosing bet, Fei."<p>End<p>[1] Khu Lon has, apparently, forgotten that Ranma took out Saffron,<br/>when her entire village put together probably couldn't accomplish the<br/>same feat.<p>[2] No one but me is allowed to say this. Ever. This is my<br/>trademarked saying. It has a tendency to piss my mom and little<br/>brother off. Heh.
