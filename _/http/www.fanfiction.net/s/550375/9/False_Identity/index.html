</div>As I've told my ever lovely pre-readers (hihi ^-^V), the trigger for<br/>the Cat to take FULL control, was his ailurophobia. Ranma never<br/>actually left the Cat mindset back when miss therapist got a hold of<br/>him. Any extreme emotion will set Ranma off into the Cat's control-<br/>s'why he doesn't seem to get all that worked up about people saying<br/>they want to kill him; he's been raised not to hit that peak.<p>Most of this was typed up in one sitting. Took me a whole week to<br/>write this (started almost immediately after I finished writing<br/>chapter seven. Which I started immediately after writing chapter six.)<br/>I'm not to sure if it's any good, and I know Ranma is way OOC. Oh<br/>well. Things are a bit more light hearted in chapter nine. (Half done,<br/>already)<p>This was seventeen pages on loose leaf- ten typed, before formatting.<br/>I wonder how many it is now?<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Eight: Perspective<br/>Li Xiang<p>"Oh Shit."<p>Ryouga held one arm in front of his face, using the other to bat the<br/>insane girl off him. The Cat yowled in protest and pain as she was<br/>slammed into a wall from the force of the Lost Boy's throw.<p>"...the hell? What's wrong with Ranko?"<p>Ryouga flicked his eyes in Yohji's direction before dropping into a<br/>stance in preparation of another attack. It was not long in coming as<br/>a blur of red launched itself at him. The Cat was met with a vicious<br/>punch, just barely twisting out of the path without getting hit.<p>Ryouga had expected this. He'd shifted his weight onto his back leg,<br/>snapping out with a brutal front kick. And, just to be on the safe<br/>side, as he snapped his foot back, he twisted sideways, stacking his<br/>hips, and slammed an equally powerful sidekick into Ranma's ribs.<p>The Cat responded with a slash of her claws that had Ryouga himself<br/>howling in pain. The claws of pure, raw ki tore through his clothing<br/>to bite into his skin. Blood pooled along the paper-cut thin<br/>lacerations. He stumbled back as the pain hit, but kept enough<br/>presence of mind to slam his fist out- hitting Ranma in the side of<br/>the head.<p>She hit the ground on all fours, shaking her head out, in an attempt<br/>to dispel the dizzying pain lancing through her skull. Ryouga<br/>recovered first- after all, he only had a few cuts and slashes on his<br/>arms, compared to Ranma's having a fist impact against her skull- his<br/>hands glowing with the sickly green of depression chi.<p>His face contorted into a grimace of heartrending sadness and<br/>depression. The glowing ball in his hands grew as he simultaneously<br/>fed his depression off the chi's power, and sent his increasing<br/>depression into the ball. It became over powering, to the point where,<br/>some eight feet away, Yohji could feel the depression washing over<br/>him.<p>His hand flew to his watch, preparing to take the male martial artist<br/>out with his wire, should things get more out of control. Even if he<br/>and Ranko weren't exactly the best of friends- or friends, at all-<br/>he couldn't just let her die...<p>"SHI SHI HOKOUDAN!"<p>The assassin's jaw dropped as the green energy tore itself from<br/>Ryouga's palms to slam ever so painfully into The Cat as she shot<br/>herself forwards for another attack. Ranma gave a yowl of pure,<br/>unadulterated pain that tapered into nothing. There were a few<br/>minutes of silence as the dust around the wall she'd been shot through<br/>settled. Ryouga didn't relax, but there was a tired slouch to his<br/>shoulders.<p>"What..."<p>"Shi Shi Hokoudan," Ryouga started, breath coming in harsh gasps,<br/>blood steadily trickling from the wounds that decorated his arms.<br/>Yohji's hand fell away from his watch, "is my... chi technique. Ran...<br/>ko has one, too."<p>"But she didn't use hers! Why did you-"<p>"Nekoken," came the growl from the rubble. Ranko dragged herself out,<br/>bleeding from a long gash that ran from her left temple into her hair.<br/>She'd been knocked out for nearly two whole minutes- enough time for<br/>her to wrest the majority of the control of her body back from The<br/>Cat, "and that was a cheap shot, P-chan!"<p>"Don't call me P-chan!" Ryouga yanking his umbrella from his pack, and<br/>charging haphazardly in Ranko's direction punctuated his shout. The<br/>fiery stinging across his chest slowed him, but Ranko, too, was<br/>slowed- by the headache that raged across her forehead, singing in<br/>her temples. Although, even as the blood dribbled down her cheek from<br/>her wound, the headache was swiftly vanishing.<p>"RANMA! Don't tease Ryouga!"<p>It looked like Akane had recovered from the shock that, No, Ranma did<br/>_not_ love her. Honestly, after Ranma had shown up, she'd continued to<br/>date Daisuke- or any boy that asked her, really- to make Ranma<br/>jealous. To force him into marrying her in a fit of jealousy.<p>Who wouldn't want a body like Ranma-kun's to play with? And Ranma-chan<br/>would have made for some serious experimenting fun. And now...? Ranma<br/>didn't care that she was dating someone else? He wasn't getting<br/>jealous, and breaking up the date?<p>It made her so angry! And then...! To see Ranma making fun of Ryouga,<br/>when the Lost boy was so obviously hurt! (She was ignoring the wound<br/>Ranma herself had was bleeding profusely) She'd known Ranma was<br/>callous from the innumerable times he'd tormented Ryouga before... but<br/>this went to far!<p>Mallet-sama was summoned, and the youngest of the Tendou daughters ran<br/>forwards, even as Ryouga himself charged.<p>Yohji still stood to one side, jaw almost to the ground, wire<br/>forgotten. Weapons from thin air? Pure energy blasts?<p>It was no wonder Schwartz was after Ranko! If she had lived through<br/>this before- as things seemed to be pointing out... if she was<br/>capable of doing these things herself...<p>Ranko jumped out of Akane's reach, flipping over the Lot Boy's head in<br/>the process. Said Lost Boy continued to charge forwards and through<br/>the rubble, screaming, "Ranma! Get back here you coward!"<p>Ranko shook her head with a laugh, "Lost again..."<p>"I told you not to tease him, hentai!"<p>Ranko's eye twitched, "I don't have to listen to you, Kawaiikune<br/>Otemba!"<p>"Ranma!" the girl charged again, preparing to knock the redhead into<br/>the stratosphere- when said redhead grabbed Mallet-sama. The mallet's<br/>head shattered, sending wood bits in all directions as Ranko put more<br/>pressure on it.<p>"Go back to your date, Tendou. Daisuke probably wants to know why you<br/>ran off."<p>Stunned from the fact that Ranma had not only caught, but _Destroyed_<br/>her mallet, Akane could only nod weakly. She shuffled back to the<br/>restaurant, repeating under her breath, "He caught it. He destroyed<br/>it. He caught it. He..."<p>"Anou... Ranko?"<p>Blue eyes turned to him, darkening with irritation, "What?"<p>Yohji didn't bother to ask about the fight. He'd figure it out later,<br/>he decided. Instead, he grinned. He couldn't help it- Ranko's shirt<br/>had all but been destroyed while fighting Ryouga. She looked down,<br/>following his gaze, and hissed angrily.<p>She looked up, "You got a credit card, Kudou?"<p>-<p>"Omi, where's Yohji?"<p>The teenager reigned in the urge to choke the older girl. This was the<br/>eighth time that she had asked, in this hour alone! When he'd returned<br/>from school, he'd found both Yohji and Ranko gone. Ken had told him<br/>that Yohji had followed Ranko on a delivery, around noon.<p>It was six o'clock, and neither of them is back.<p>"Why am _I_ holding the bags?" Oh wait, yes, they are.<p>Most of the store looked up as Yohji followed Ranko in. She wasn't<br/>wearing the Chinese style clothing she'd left in. Instead, she had on<br/>a pair of black denim jeans, and a red t-shirt. Both fit much more<br/>snugly than her other clothing had. She had a black and red track<br/>jacket thrown over top.<p>Yohji, on the other hand, looked pained, carrying three bags. Most of<br/>them are variations on the black pants, red top theme, although Yohji<br/>had convinced her to by other things, as well. How the man did this,<br/>is not to be known.<p>"You're the guy, you carry the bags," Oh, she was just loving this, it<br/>was like getting revenge on Akane, who'd made him carry her bags when<br/>they'd gone shopping, "Besides. I don't like you."<p>"Nice reason," the longhaired male grumbled.<p>Ranko stopped in front of the counter, "Sorry about being late, Aya.<br/>Kudou made me get more than one set of clothing," she shrugged, "mine<br/>were destroyed in a fight."<p>Aya glowered at her, and she smiled brightly, "Don't take so long next<br/>time."<p>While the majority of the shop gaped in shock, Ranko nodded with a<br/>grin. The redheaded girl walked into the back, Yohji following<br/>grumpily.<p>One of the girls turned to give Aya a dark look, "Why does _she_ get<br/>to go back there, Aya?"<p>The violet eyed one looked down at the teenage girl, "She works here,<br/>Sakura."<p>"Since when?"<p>"Since yesterday," Sakura shrieked at the sudden appearance of Ranko<br/>behind her. She hadn't even seen the older girl come out! A shiver ran<br/>down her spine. The last time she'd seen someone got that fast... she<br/>shook it off as the female redhead padded off to water the plants,<br/>wearing Yohji's apron. The twenty one year old came out a moment<br/>later, not looking all that happy. Although, he had at least managed<br/>to get out of working, since he doesn't have an apron.<p>"She's creepy, Aya. Why is she working here?"<p>Aya didn't answer Sakura, merely returning to his own duties in the<br/>shop. All the while keeping an eye on the other redhead.<p>-<p>"Hey Bishoujo."<p>Ranma looked up with a scowl that quickly turned into a smile,<br/>"Jei-sama!"<p>"Kitty," the Irishman was frowning, "You gave Abyssian the sword." It<br/>was not a question. It was a statement.<p>A panicked look entered the girl's eyes, which darted over to<br/>Schuldich's face. The flame haired man smirked at her, before she<br/>looked back to Farfello, bowing her head, "M'sorry Jei-sama."<p>"Why?"<p>She blushed, "I was hungry..."<p>Schuldich gave both of them an odd look. Farfello was nodding like it<br/>was a perfectly acceptable reason, and Ranma radiated relief. The pale<br/>haired man grabbed Ranma's wrist, as he had done the night before, and<br/>began tugging her away from the Koneko no Sumi Ie.<p>"I have to be back tonight."<p>Farfello paused, "Why? You're mine!"<p>Ranma nodded, "I know, Jei-sama. I'm staying, though."<p>"Why's that, Bishoujo?"<p>Ranma shot Schuldich a sour look, before turning back to Farfello,<br/>"You do not understand Abyssian, ne?"<p>"What's that got to do with anything?" Farfello was doing that creepy<br/>grown man pouting, again. He'd really been hoping that Ranma would<br/>come with him to destroy God's happiness. To watch the streets become<br/>washed in blood.<p>He wanted to watch Kitty drink that blood, once more.<p>"I'm figuring him out," Ranma grinned, "He's an odd one, Jei-sama."<p>"Vengeance-driven," Schuldich proclaimed, "What else is there to<br/>know?"<p>Farfello frowned- he often wondered that himself, when he<br/>contemplated Fujimiya "Aya" Ran. Whatever the reason, Abyssian, while<br/>confused him, also fascinates him. It seemed odd that Kitty had picked<br/>this up already. They had seen each other no more than three times<br/>these last few days.<p>"So what are we doing now, Jei-sama?"<p>Farfello returned him attention to the girl who's wrist he held, "Turn<br/>you back to normal."<p>"And after that?" Schuldich didn't know why Farfello had asked him to<br/>come along. While it would be fun to torment Kitty, if he was going to<br/>be doing that all night, it might get boring. Farfello tossed the<br/>redheads a nasty grin.<p>"We hunt."<p>Ranma's eyes gleamed, a matching grin fluttering across her face. She<br/>had the apron off and draped over the counter in an instant, "Let's<br/>get going, then!"<p>-<p>A trio of shadows perched at the edge of the roof, eyes alight for any<br/>motion. Their target lay below, waiting for a bus. The three men<br/>grinned, moonlight and streetlights making white teeth flash.<p>/C'mon, Bishoujo. Your turn./<p>/My target, then?/ without waiting for a response to his question, the<br/>dark haired teen dropped off the roof, with aloof confidence. His feet<br/>made no sound as she landed lightly, standing in a single smooth<br/>motion from the deep knee bend.<p>Black jeans, loose, held up with a black leather belt, and a slightly<br/>oversized black t-shirt that clung to him. His black hair was woven<br/>into a French braid, pulling the hair away from his face. While it<br/>would have looked odd on any other man, this teen's effeminate<br/>features made it look rather natural.<p>Stormy blue eyes glinted as he glided across the ground to the<br/>thirty-some man at the bus stop. Raking his fingers through his bangs,<br/>he grinned, "Excuse me, ah Sir?"<p>The man turned to him blinked, "What do you want?"<p>Ranma- for that was who it was- scratched beneath his braid, "I was<br/>wondering when the next bus comes."<p>The man gave him a suspicious look, before checking his watch, "Ten<br/>minutes."<p>"Oh, good," the ebon haired boy purred, "I've got enough time."<p>"Time to what?" the man had to admit he was curious as to what the<br/>athletic looking boy wanted to do. Ranma's lips curled with a twisted<br/>smirk that made a chill race down his spine, and stepped back in fear.<p>Ranma's posture shifted from 'lazy teenager' to 'deadly predator', as<br/>he padded around the thirty year old with measured steps. An<br/>unconcerned visage greeted the now visibly shivering man, "You have<br/>ten minutes. Should you live that long... I'll let you go free. I<br/>doubt you will."<p>"Wha... what do y-you mean?" came the stutter, and Ranma dragged his<br/>fingers down his back. The man shot off in terror, almost flying down<br/>the street.<p>/Aren't you going to go after him, Bishoujo?/<p>/In a moment, Schuldich. It's not as fun if you don't give them a head<br/>start./<p>Schuldich smirked, as Ranma seemed to vanish. He could still "see"<br/>Ranma, via the boy's thoughts, but otherwise, the boy no longer<br/>existed.<p>"One of the Forbidden techniques," he mused allowed to Farfello, as<br/>they stood. The redheaded man brushed a stray of hair out his face<br/>before motion to the Irishman, "I know where he is."<p>"Follow him!" the lunatic snapped, "I want to see Kitty hunt!"<p>The flamed haired one chuckled.<p>-<p>"One more minute."<p>The purr seemed to come from all about Shidou Yoshida. There was no<br/>source as he spun about in the small splash of light on the street.<p>He thought he'd be safer in the light. The insane boy wouldn't risk<br/>being seen, would he? To kill him in the light, at the edge of a busy<br/>road...<p>... that wasn't so busy. Yoshida realized, with a sick twist in his<br/>stomach, that he'd been herded into a residential area. There was no<br/>one about so late at night.<p>"Do you think the light will save you?"<p>He spun, but there was still no sign of the madman. A split second of<br/>movement seen from the corner of his eye had him spinning to the left.<br/>Nothing.<p>"Thirty seconds, Dear Sir."<p>He stumbled back as the boy seemed to melt out of the _light_. It lit<br/>his face with stark orangish-white light, darkening his hair and<br/>clothes past the color of pitch black on a moonless night. Blue eyes<br/>glinted from the shadow of his fringe of bangs.<p>And in one hand, he gripped a katana that shone in the night.<p>He bounced on the balls of his feet, before lunging forwards, blade<br/>brought to bare.<p>Yoshida stumbled back, praying to God to save his life. The blade<br/>nicked his raised arms, but little else.<p>"Twenty Seconds."<p>The blade flashed again, and once more did little more than slash<br/>across crossed arms, "Thank you, God," he whimpered.<p>Ranma's eyes hardened, "God will leave you in the end. Five seconds."<p>The blade did not miss. Not this time. The Saotome Family honor blade<br/>took a life, once more, for the first time in over a decade. It seemed<br/>to sing with the taste of blood as it sliced across the man's throat.<p>"It's too bad," the boy sighed dramatically, "I was actually thinking<br/>of letting you go. And with only five seconds left... oh well."<p>He knelt by the man who lay dying; drowning in his own blood. Fingers<br/>brushed across the wound before he placed his whole palm on it, "Good<br/>bye."<p>His ki flared.<p>-<p>Farfello was darting forwards as soon as the energy had dissipated.<br/>There was nothing left of the man aside from piece of a charred suit.<br/>Ranma was calmly licking the blood from his hand. His blue eyes caught<br/>Jei's amber.<p>"It didn't work."<p>"What didn't work, Bishoujo?" since Farfello seemed more interested in<br/>looping his arms around the younger boy's waist, and burying his face<br/>in Ranma's neck, Schuldich asked. The ebony haired boy gave a purr,<br/>lifting the still slightly bloody palm to run it across Jei's face.<p>Ranma looked at the jade-eyed telepath, "Hinako-sensei's happo go<br/>ensatsu. I think I over did it." Schuldich's hiked eyebrow made him<br/>explain, "It's a chi-draining technique, to replenish your own stores.<br/>Hinako-sensei uses it to get her adult body... I know the chi and ki<br/>patterns to do it, I've just never bothered to try..."<p>"And you failed?"<p>"Over did it," another purr, that ended as Farfello drew away from his<br/>pet, "Not suppose ta dissolve the body, just drain it."<p>"You'll figure it out," Jei stated with a smug smile, "Did good<br/>tonight, Kitty."<p>"Thank-you, Jei-sama."<p>-<p>The shadow slipped into the Koneko no Sumi Ie, tip toeing its way<br/>through the plants, drifting towards the door that lead to the living<br/>quarters. It's hand landed on the knob, twisting it silently, as the<br/>shadow crept inside.<p>It turned, closing the door slowly, quietly. A soft click gave notice<br/>to the door's shutting- and a light snapped on. Ranko froze, before<br/>turning.<p>Aya was leaning against the wall beside the lights fixing her with a<br/>cold stare. She gave a weak smile, scratching at her neck, just above<br/>where Farfello had nuzzled- and bit- her. Dried blood decorated the<br/>skin, "Oh, uh, hey Aya."<p>"You took off."<p>"Saw some friends. Went with them to have some fun."<p>Aya's violet eyes narrowed, "'Fun'? You've got blood on your face."<br/>Ranko's fingers darted to her cheeks, rubbing the splatters of<br/>Yoshida's dried blood off, "You were with Farfello, then."<p>Ranko shrugged, "Yeah, so I was. What of it?"<p>Aya frowned, already icy eyes turning cold as death. He said nothing<br/>in response, instead, turning on his heel. He stalked back towards his<br/>room. Ranko's stomach clenched and she followed the other redhead<br/>meekly. She didn't really know just _why_ she felt like this, but she<br/>didn't bother to analyze her feelings.<p>"Your room isn't completely cleared out, the bed is still covered in<br/>junk, however, the floor is cleared. You can sleep there."<p>"If it's all the same to you..." Ranko's lips quirked at Aya's back,<br/>"... can I stay in your room again, tonight?"<p>Aya said nothing, but left the door open behind him.<p>End
