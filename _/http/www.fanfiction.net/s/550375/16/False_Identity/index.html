</div>It took two weeks, but here it is. Chapter Fifteen.<p>My prereader tells me to slow down on how much of the fics I'm doing<br/>lately- what with finals coming up and all. Atfirst, I wasn't really<br/>listening. I mean, I started False Identity sixteen weeks- four<br/>months- ago. During final exams. The fact that I only had one exam to<br/>take then, didn't penetrate until last night. I have three finals this<br/>semester- Math, Social/History (French Revolution to World War I +<br/>Global Diveristy/Disparity), and English.<p>Not to mention Karate practise, guitar practise, reviewing websites,<br/>updating Legions (my sprite comic) every monday, my little brother's<br/>fifteenth birthday is nine days away (the nineteenth), mother's day is<br/>way to soon, etc, etc.<p>So, the chapters may be a little slow in coming.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Fifteen: Battles<br/>Li Xiang<p>She had managed to drag herself out of bed after the fight outside<br/>awoken her. Jei's lips curled in a silent snarl of disgust as he paced<br/>down the stairs behind her. She had, on multiple occasions, hurt his<br/>kitty. She would pay.<p>The knife handle in his palm was cool and familiar, as his hand<br/>clenched spasmodically around it. He didn't even utter his war cry as<br/>he descended upon her, blade positioned for the kill.<p>She must have heard something, because she turned slightly, and the<br/>blade tore into her skin, scraping along the upper edge of her shoulder<br/>blade. Even as her brain just barely made the connection, a scream of<br/>pain leapt from her lips. Tendou Akane whirled around to face her<br/>attacker.<p>Pale hair framed a man's face, dark scars patterning his skin. A single<br/>cold amber eye glared down at her, a confusing melee of insanity, rage,<br/>desperation, and calculating intelligence within.<p>Her eyes shifted past him, desperately searching for someone-<br/>anyone!- to save her from this madman. Then, out of the shadows, came<br/>the one who always rescued her. Always saved her.<p>"Ranma!"<p>The fact that two more men, and Nabiki came in from the kitchen blew<br/>past her. Her fiancee was here! He'd save her, like always, and she'd<br/>beat on him, and everything would go back to normal.<p>Her world shattered as Ranma's icy voice came to her, "You missed."<p>Jei pulled back, scowling, "I know that." his eyes shifted to behind<br/>her, and he smirked. Akane whirled, terrified that another attack had<br/>came up from behind her.<p>Her blood splattered as Jei reached out and yanked his blade free. She<br/>gave a yelp of pain; spinning around to face her pale-haired tormentor<br/>once more. Despite her exhaustion from the day's "training", she was<br/>ready to battle. Adrenaline began pumping, and her anger starts to boil<br/>over.<p>She ignored Nabiki's attempt to grab her arm and pull her to safety.<br/>Even with her blood spilling out of her shoulder, Akane was confident<br/>she could take this one eyed freak out.<p>Raising her hands, ignoring the sharp sting from the motion, and the<br/>warm liquid dripping down her back, she summoned Mallet-sama. Behind<br/>Jei, Ranma flinched instinctually upon seeing the weapon. Farfello may<br/>not have seen his Kitty's reaction to it, but he'd been told of it<br/>before.<p>His lips curled back, as the mallet swept through where his head had<br/>been. His blood-slicked knife was clenched in his fist, and he, in<br/>turn, lunged at his target.<p>Akane had closed her eyes on the swing, being so used to having Ranma<br/>under the mallet's head. When the expected resistance of wood meeting<br/>flesh did _not_ happen, she paused. She blinked, her eyes open, just in<br/>time to see Jei's lunge. Her shriek pierced the air one again, and she<br/>stumbled backwards. The knife tore through her shirt, ripping upwards<br/>as it sunk into her left breast. Another scream rent the air as Akane<br/>tried to pull away, as Farfello attempted to drive the knife through<br/>his victim's heart.<p>"Ranma!" Nabiki was trying to get past Yohji and Omi to free her<br/>sister, "Ranma! Stop him!"<p>"Why should I?" Ranma's voice was airy as he watched Jei tear into his<br/>former fiancee, "She's tried to kill _me_ since I met her!"<p>Yohji grit his teeth. He was finding new reasons to hate Ranma every<br/>moment. His own Farfello-given wound throbbed, as did the rest of his<br/>body from the beating Ranma had given him. Still, he'd worked through<br/>worse, and so he left Nabiki in Omi's care.<p>His wire looped around Farfello's throat, and he yanked back. While<br/>Farfello couldn't register the pain of the attack, he could recognize<br/>that he couldn't breath, as any other man would. Jei released the knife<br/>to claw at the wire cutting off his air passage.<p>Akane was pulling the blade out, unheeding of anything but the<br/>desperate panic of getting the blade away from her. Ranma only tossed<br/>her a cursory glance as he leapt at Yohji. The ki claws slipped into<br/>the two inch length he could summon when angered- and not fully lost<br/>to the madness. They tore through the wire, and Jei stumbled forwards,<br/>with a heavy rasping gasp of air.<p>Snarling, Ranma once again turned on Yohji. The older man cursed in his<br/>mind, as he attempted, painfully, to dodge the martial artist's attack.<p>Nabiki had rushed to her sister's side when Yohji attacked Jei. She<br/>had, with an extreme lack of modesty, ripped her robe off, to cover<br/>Akane's gushing wounds. The young mercenary had _not_ seen Ranma's own<br/>response. The first inkling she had of it was when she was forcibly<br/>thrown out of the way- landing on Omi.<p>Farfello snatched his knife up again, bringing it down in what would be<br/>a fatal blow- right through the stunned and bleeding girl's exposed<br/>throat. Unfortunately, something got in the way- Nabiki's leg. The<br/>brunette gave a shrill scream, as the blade pierced her leg, having<br/>swung it in the way, from where she'd sat on Omi.<p>The knife blade scraped the bone before Jei yanked it free. A feral<br/>grin crossed his face, "If you want to die _now_ fine with me..."<p>"Leave my sister alone!" Despite practically bleeding to death, Akane<br/>slammed her knee up and into Farfello's gut. As usual, the pain didn't<br/>register, and he merely growled in response to the attack. Again, the<br/>blade leapt forwards, Akane dragging her arms up to block the attack.<br/>It ripped through the skin of her arms and he slashed again, and again.<br/>Omi and Nabiki pounded on him, trying to drag him away form the<br/>youngest Tendou.<p>After a few dozen bleeding tracks appeared in Akane's arms, Jei pulled<br/>back. Wearily, she dropped her arms, ready to put them back up if he<br/>came at her again. However, Jei was faster. Even _with_ Nabiki and Omi<br/>on each arm, the blade glinted darkly as it flashed through the air,<br/>and sliced through her face.<p>Her right eye would be forever useless, should she survive the massive<br/>blood loss from her wounds combined. The blade had scraped the bone of<br/>her skull- had, in fact, left a craved track _in_ the bone- and the<br/>slash ran from scalp to jaw bone on an angle.<p>With a satisfied grin, Farfello savored the sound of her tortured<br/>scream. Bounding to his feet, the madman threw Omi off- Nabiki having<br/>let go to race to tend to her sister's wounds again. He licked the<br/>blood off his blade, turning on his heel to pad outside. The second<br/>battle between Yohji and Ranma had come to an end out there.<p>Yohji lay, face first and unconscious, on the ground. Ranma had broken<br/>Yohji's arm with a throw- the one that had sent the playboy outside-<br/>and most likely cracked a few ribs when he'd been body-slammed into the<br/>ground.<p>Ranma hauled Yohji up by the back of his jacket, bearing his claws. He<br/>was ready to finish the man off.<p>... when the man vanished.<p>Both men spun around, searching for whoever took the unconscious<br/>playboy. It was Ranma who spotted the savior. Khu Lon set the man down<br/>on the Tendou roof, having originally thought the man was a woman, with<br/>his hair; it was the only reason she'd bothered to save him. Xian Phu<br/>dropped into a defensive crouch in front of Farfello. She could still<br/>feel his kick from earlier that night.<p>"What do you want, Shampoo?"<p>Jei's eyes narrowed at Ranma's words. So _this_ was Xian Phu's human<br/>form. _This_ was the girl who wanted to steal Farfello's property. The<br/>knife, of which had been held loosely in his fingers, was suddenly held<br/>in a white knuckled grip. He was growling.<p>"Airen come to Shampoo, yes? Airen let Shampoo take care of Bad<br/>One-Eye, yes?"<p>"No," Ranma snorted, "I won;'t. But I _will_ let Jei-sama deal with<br/>_you_"<p>Farfello lunged, blade searing the air as it ripped through where the<br/>young Nyucheuzu girl _had_ been. She was a better martial artist-<br/>faster, too- than Akane, and wasn't injured. She darted between<br/>thrusts of the knife. No matter how many times her bonbori hit him, he<br/>didn't stop. Khu Lon frowned, and Omi came running out from the<br/>kitchen. The seventeen year old cursed, then shouted, "Get away from<br/>him! He _can't_ feel pain!"<p>The amazon matriarch froze, then repeated Omi's warning to her<br/>great-granddaughter. This time, the female warrior didn't ignore it, as<br/>it wasn't just something a mere male shouted at her. She backed off,<br/>bouncing to the roof, beside her great-grandmother, "Why Shampoo stop,<br/>Hibaa-chan?"<p>"The man is unable to feel pain. You can't just hurt him- you must<br/>_kill_ him."<p>"Yes, Hibaa-chan!"<p>However, by this time the blare of sirens was drawing closer. Neither<br/>Ranma nor Farfello were up for being arrested, they quickly hightailed<br/>it out of the Tendou-ke. Farfello left the amazons with a warning,<br/>"Next time, you die."<p>-<p>Rache collapsed into the futon in her apartment with a sigh. The young<br/>woman scrubbed her forehead irritably. She had gotten next to no sleep<br/>over the past few days- since _before_ Ken's "kidnaping". She was<br/>tired and cranky, and her mind just _wouldn't_ shut off.<p>"Damn," she growled, "It's times like this I wish I had Schu's<br/>telepathy. I could just annoy some kid on the street, then."<p>Hauling herself back up, the redhead paced her floor for a few minutes.<br/>At about five minutes into her pointless pacing, Rache's face broke<br/>into a grin, "I can _still_ annoy someone!"<p>With a gleeful cackle, Rache picked through her belongings. Her<br/>landlord- Kino- was about to get a nasty surprise.<p>-<p>The boy sat there, calmly licking one hand as he balanced on his<br/>haunches. There were small scratches decorating his throat, about the<br/>collar. The leather was scratched and almost broken through by the time<br/>Jei returned to Kitty's "cage".<p>Kitty's hackles rose, and he hissed at the reason behind his captivity.<br/>The amber-eyed Irish boy stared into his pet's eyes, before dropping a<br/>bird carcass into the cage. Cautiously, the eight-year-old padded<br/>closer, sniffing at the meat. When he found nothing amiss, the boy sunk<br/>his teeth into the still warm body, pulling back.<p>"Kitty's been good," Jei declared suddenly, watching the feral child<br/>crunching the bird in his jaws. He stepped forwards, pulling the boards<br/>apart, and grabbing Kitty's chain. Once the bird had been eaten, Jei<br/>dragged Kitty out of his cage.<p>"Have to get you a new collar," Jei muttered, looking down at the once<br/>brand new leather collar. It looked ready to fall apart.<p>-<p>Ranma was leaning against the outer wall of the Kunou mansion as the<br/>sun rose. He was asleep, dozing with his ankles and arms crossed, head<br/>bent. Farfello was no where in sight, as Reiji's limousine pulled out<br/>of the mansion. For a moment, the car paused, as though wondering if it<br/>should stop to pick the boy up, before driving away.<p>Ranma didn't notice, as entrapped in his sleep as he was. An hour and a<br/>half later, he jerked awake to the _lovely_ sound of Schuldich's mental<br/>voice.<p>/Morning Bishoujo./<p>"Don't call me that," Ranma grunted, prying his eyes open, "Huh? I'm<br/>still at the mansion."<p>/Reiji left you and Farf behind,/ Ranma could _feel_ the smirk,<br/>/Something about causing problems...?/<p>The martial artist snorted, tucking his hands into his pockets, after<br/>swinging his pack on his back, and wandered off in search of his best<br/>friend/master, /Kunou deserved it./<p>/He'll never be able to use that arm properly, again, Bishoujo.<br/>Crippled for life./<p>/Like I said,/ Ranma huffed, /He deserved it./ Where _is_ Jei-sama? He<br/>hadn't seen the man since he'd decided he was going to search Nerima.<br/>Ranma had figured he'd just go back to the Kunou mansion and be<br/>prepared to leave.<p>/You two get into anymore trouble after _that_ mess?/ While it was<br/>getting easier to read Kitty's mind, it was still tougher than a normal<br/>human's. Ranma chuckled.<p>/Akane probably didn't survive the night, once Jei-sama was done with<br/>her, Nabiki will never be able to walk without a limp, and Kudou got<br/>his ass handed to him./<p>/Weiss?/ Schuldich frowned to himself, /What was Weiss doing there?/<p>/Nabiki and Tsukiyono know each other,/ Ranma shrugged, /Can you find<br/>Jei-sama for me?/<p>A laugh came across the mental link, /And turn _myself_ into a raving<br/>lunatic? Danke, but nien. You're on your own, Bishoujo./ The man began<br/>to pull away from the teen's mind, when he stopped, /Bradley says<br/>you'll find Farfie outside the Nekohanton./<p>/Tell Crawford thanks,/ Ranma's voice was a bit hurried. He should have<br/>known Jei would go after his so-called "wife". With a burst of speed,<br/>Ranma shot forwards, bounding to the roofs in the direction of the<br/>Nekohanton.<p>Xian Phu wasn't all that bad, actually. If she'd get over the stupid<br/>kiss-of-death/kiss-of-marriage thing, and got away from Khu Lon, she'd<br/>probably be pretty nice. It wasn't that Khu Lon was evil, per say,<br/>merely old fashioned.<p>Although, the same could be said about Genma- if you switched old<br/>fashioned with "greedy bastard." In any case, Ranma didn't want Xian<br/>Phu _dead_... maybe a little _maimed_ to get those stupid laws out of<br/>her head though.<p>Maimed was okay.<p>He dropped down off the roofs in time to see Jei get blasted through<br/>the front window of the restaurant. Khu Lon pogoed out, followed by<br/>Xian Phu. The younger amazon was limping, and bleeding from various<br/>wounds, although none were as bad as Akane's had been. Khu Lon must<br/>have interfered.<p>Khu Lon's staff lashed out to slamm Farfello again; and this time, it<br/>was Ranma who interfered. The staff was clapped between both hands<br/>before it got close to his Jei-sama.<p>The pale-haired assassin pulled free a new knife - the other having<br/>been lost somewhere within the Nekohanton. He drew himself up, and<br/>threw himself in Khu Lon's direction. Xian Phu's bonbori rammed into<br/>his gut, and he whirled to face her. Red eyes[1] met amber, and the<br/>pair shot into motion. No matter how many times she slammed her bonbori<br/>into his body, he kept coming. While the majority of his wild slashes<br/>were turned aside.<p>Khu Lon threw Ranma away from her, but he flipped in mid-air, pushing<br/>off the front window of the building across the street, and raced<br/>forwards. The matriarch swung her staff like a baseball bat, but Ranma<br/>was a master of mid-air combat.<p>He twisted, dropping low enough to the ground to brace himself with one<br/>hand, and swung his legs around- his left knee caught her in the<br/>chest, the right in her face.<p>Jei's blade slashed out, once, twice, three times, the early morning<br/>light flashing across it. Another slash blocked by the bonbori- but<br/>this time, Farfello kicked out, catching her in the gut. Xian Phu<br/>stumbled back with a grunt, barely getting to her feet before Jei was<br/>on her.<p>This time his attacks hit home- digging rivers of blood across arms<br/>and chest. He was trying for what would mean death for her- her neck.<p>Khu Lon hooked Ranma's leg with her staff, sweeping his feet out from<br/>under him. Before his hands could touch and send him into a back flip,<br/>Khu Lon's staff flashed again, sending him careening into Farfello.<p>As this was happening, Jei had found the perfect opportunity. He<br/>started to stab the amazon, when Ranma hit. The two men went down in a<br/>tangle of limbs, and the stab became a slash. Again, Xian Phu stumbled<br/>backwards, this time holding her throat in shock. Blood was pooling<br/>between her fingers.<p>The eldest of the elders looked over to her great-granddaughter, and<br/>cursed. At a speed only ki-empowered, ancient martial artists on<br/>adrenaline, could achieve, Khu Lon lifted the girl into her arms, and<br/>ran in the direction of the Nerima District hospital, cradling her<br/>bleeding descendant.<p>Ranma and Farfello untangled themselves, although Jei kept a possessive<br/>hand on Kitty's shoulder. The ebony-haired martial artist sighed, "I<br/>should go back to the Koneko, Jei-sama..."<p>End<p>[1]Are Shampoo's eyes red? I can't remember, and the only picture I<br/>have of her on my hard drive isn't clear enough, but they look red.
