</div>Lately, I seem to have become ensnared by Final Fantasy 8. While we (or<br/>rather, my younger brother) have had the game for months, only recently<br/>have I actually become interested in playing it. And reading fanfics.<br/>Especially Squall/Seifer. (Seifer is God. ^-^V) Which is what I've been<br/>doing instead of writing.<p>Oh yeah. I've never owned a cat. I'll likely get one when I move out,<br/>but my father is allergic to them. On that note, I rarely come in<br/>contact with them. If Ranma's not acting like a cat, blame it on my<br/>father's allergies.<p>I'm trying to keep the postings at  and Lady Cosmos' around the<br/>same time. Which should be about once a week.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Four: Enter Weiss<br/>Li Xiang<p>"Who the hell are you?"<p>Saotome Ranma, martial artist, part time demolitions worker, general<br/>pain in the rear, sought after by many a lady, and also known to few as<br/>"Kitty", gave the redheaded assassin a dark look. He didn't recognise<br/>Schuldich at all- not even the scent he could pick up was familiar, so<br/>it meant that Jei had made some friends over the eight years apart.<br/>Although not unexpected, there was an odd flash of jealousy at that.<br/>Jei was _his_ friend.<p>"Schuldich," said man introduced himself with a slight bow, and a large<br/>smirk. Oh, how he was going to have fun with this boy! Jealousy was<br/>radiating off him over the prospect of Farfello having gotten himself a<br/>'replacement' for Kitty. All he really had to worry about was the boy's<br/>insane speed- although he could probably match him, Schuldich would<br/>have to force himself to the level Ranma moved at naturally-, and the<br/>fact that he'd ripped apart a vitual god with his bare hands with no<br/>apparent remorse. He'd have to redirect those feelings so they didn't<br/>end up focused on him.<p>But, aside from that...<p>Farfello had snagged Ranma's raised hand, grinning in that creepy way<br/>of his. The one that screamed 'I've found a new way to hurt god'. For a<br/>moment, the telepath was tempted to peek into his pale haired frined's<br/>mind to see what he was thinking, then banished the thought. Right at<br/>this particular moment, he didn't really want to go into Farfello's<br/>mind. When that look entered that golden iris, it was safer to have his<br/>mental sheilds on maxium, to prevent himself from going insane.<p>Schuldich spoke before Farfello had a chance to even start on one of<br/>his 'Hurt-God' rambles, "I've a proposition for you, bishounen." Sure,<br/>it was his nickname for Nagi, but it fit the pigtailed boy oh-so-well.<br/>Smokey blue eyes narrowed sharply, a quick glance in the direction of<br/>the money-grubbing girl who was currently gaping like a fish, trying to<br/>figure out just what the hell was going on around her.<p>"What kind of proposition...?"<p>Schuldich's own eyes flicked to the girl, "It would be best if this was<br/>discussed in private, Saotome."<p>Ranma nodded, and started to drop into a crouch to bounce to the roof<br/>before pausing, and opening his mouth. Before the question even crossed<br/>his lips, Schuldich's mental voice brushed against him, /Yes, we can<br/>roofhop./<p>The boy looked at him, clearly startled, confusion jarring his features,<br/>before Schuldich gave him a mental smirk, /This is part of what we have<br/>to talk about, Katzchen./<p>The martial artist stared at him for a few more moments before sighing<br/>softly, "We'd best leave on foot, then take to the roofs. Nabiki<br/>shouldn't be able to follow us then."<p>Schuldich agreed, again smirking, and shoved his hands in his pockets,<br/>"Let's go Farf. We've got a lot of talk about, eh?"<p>"Kitty needs to learn the game rules," Farfello agreed, again with that<br/>distrubing smile, and Ranma gave his friend a strange look. Sure, Jei<br/>had been a little out of sorts when they'd first met, but this was<br/>pretty extreme, even for him. What had happened over the years?<p>As the trio left the Tendou-ke, Nabiki snapped out of her daze, and<br/>crept swiftly after them, a frown marring her features. She'd been<br/>expecting the two gaijin to attack Ranma, not ask him a couple<br/>questions, and call him Kitty. Only three feet away from the gate,<br/>Nabiki froze.<p>Kitty? Like on his collar?<p>Then... her eyes narrowed. One of those men was Ranma's "Jei-sama".<br/>And, quite obviously from his reactions, it was the white haired man<br/>with the eyepatch, Farfello.<p>Casting her gaze about for the unusal- even for gaijin- men. They<br/>weren't on the streets, which left her with the rooftops. And with her<br/>own inability to roofhop- hell, not even Akane, her martial artist<br/>sister, could roofhop- it would be impossible to track them. Dammit<br/>all.<p>As she returned to her room, she persed her lips. Looks like I'm going<br/>to have to call in a favor I was hoping to keep open for a few more<br/>years...<p>-<p>Sprawlled across the branches in a tree above their heads, Ranma lazily<br/>watched Jei lick a knife and stare off into space, and Schuldich make<br/>himself comfortable on the ground. Sure, the redhead could have made a<br/>bed out of the tree branches like Ranma, but what was the point? The<br/>only reason Ranma was really up there was to keep his rivals and<br/>enemies from seeing him. Afterall, with his long hair, Schuldich could<br/>be mistaken for a girl by those blind, 'trigger' happy idiots Kuno,<br/>Mousse and Ryouga.<p>"So what's this deal?"<p>Schuldich hiked an eyebrow. He hadn't expected the martial artist to<br/>iniciate the conversation, although with the way previous 'deals' had<br/>ended up, Ranma probably wanted to feel like he was in control of his<br/>own fate. The assassin grinned at this; Ranma had a hard life... he'd<br/>fit in perfectly with the rest of Schwartz.<p>"We want you to join us."<p>"Huh?" Great answer, Ranma! he growled to himself, but before he could<br/>go any further into it, Schuldich responded.<p>"We want you to join Schwartz." The redhead shifted a bit- the tree<br/>trunk was damned uncomfortable!<p>"And what's Schwartz?"<p>"Us," came Farfello's answer, "Schuldich, and Nagi and Crawford, and<br/>me. And hopefully you, Kitty."<p>Schuldich shook his head, "Just a group of bodyguards for hire,<br/>bishounen."<p>Ranma ignored the nickname as he pretty much ignored everything anyone<br/>called him (with the nominal exceptions of 'Pervert', 'Femboy', 'Girl'<br/>or 'Osage no Onna'), "Bodyguards?"<p>"And sometimes mercenaries," Schuldich shrugged, "We do what we're<br/>hired to do, and we get paid for it. Simple as that."<p>The martial artist thought it over for nearly ten minutes; Schuldich<br/>could hear him weight pros and cons of being a bodyguard and being<br/>paid, verus being an oft exploited martial artist. While he wasn't<br/>exactly the smartest crayon in the box, he was no slouch either. He'd<br/>been taught to focus his considerable intelligence on how to fight for<br/>almost the entire eight years prior, and probably the bit before that<br/>he couldn't remember. It was hard to break out of a years long habit.<p>Ranma flipped out of the tree with a thoughtful frown on his face, "I<br/>want to meet this Nagi and Crawford, Jei-sama, Schuldich-san."<p>"Of course," Schuldich nodded. He was pretty sure Crawford would do<br/>whatever he could to have the literal powerhouse of energy standing<br/>before them join Schwartz. He'd be quite the ace-in-the-hole, "Anything<br/>else?" the questions racing through Ranma's mind came forwards as he<br/>opened his mouth to speak.<p>"How'd you speak without movin' your mouth?"<p>-<p>"Well?"<p>Schuldich looked up from examing his fingernails later that night. He'd<br/>managed to answer the majority of Ranma's questions without giving away<br/>the fact that he and the rest of Schwartz were actually assassins.<br/>They'd spring that on Ranma once he'd joined, and had no way to back<br/>out.<p>For now, it was best if he thought they were merely bodyguards.<p>Crawford stood over the redhead, a rather impatient look on his face-<br/>Farfello had immediately gone to his cell/room to plan something<br/>dealing with Kitty, and Schuldich had been dodging Crawford's inquires<br/>all night. It didn't help that where Ranma was concerned, Crawford had<br/>visions of several separate ways things could go. If things were to go<br/>the way he wanted them to, everything had to abide by his own terms.<p>"Ranma wants to meet you and Nagi before he even considers joining."<p>Bradley gave a nod of understanding, fully expecting Schuldich to<br/>continue with a 'report' of how the Saotome Boy had reacted to<br/>Farfello's sudden reappearance in his life. The jade eyed assassin just<br/>smirked at him, and Crawford growled in the back of his throat. He'd<br/>had enough of a hard time convincing Estet that Ranma would benefit<br/>from being a part of Schwartz instead of just being part of some random<br/>group.<p>He wasn't in a good mood.<p>"Okay, okay. I'm bringing Kitty here, so he can meet you two. The kid's<br/>a pretty talented martial artist- powerful too."<p>"Fine." Crawford shot Schuldich one last parting glare, before stalking<br/>out to calm himself down. Nagi hadn't even bothered looking up from his<br/>computer once through out the whole "confrontation".<p>-<p>Even without being a telepath, it was obvious what was going through<br/>the young martial artist's mind.<p>"Farf wanted to stay back," Schuldich shrugged at the dark haired boy's<br/>questioning look. He had done some poking around in the irish man's<br/>mind, but he'd just come away as confused as to why Farf wanted to stay<br/>as he had when he went in. The pale haired man's mind worked in odd<br/>ways, "Come on, bishounen, let's go."<p>With a nod, the young man bounced up onto the fence to pad alongside<br/>Schuldich as they walked. Normally, the redhead would have taken<br/>Crawford's car to pick up Ranma, but he wanted to figure out the<br/>Martial Artist. His mind was rather odd- sometimes he thought like<br/>your normal everyday teenager, or a young child, and sometimes he<br/>thought like a wild animal- a feral cat, persay. Therefore, it would<br/>be easier to simply get the boy to talk about himself.<p>"What's with the fence-walking?"<p>Ranma blinked, then shrugged, "Balance practise. 'sides, I get a larger<br/>view of my surroundings from here. Easier to dodge an attack that way."<br/>Seemingly unheeding of the fact that he was walking along the top of a<br/>chain link fence in nothing more than thin black slippers, Ranma leaned<br/>back to watch the sky as he walked.<p>"You get attacked often then?"<p>"Every few hours," again, a nonchalant shrug, "You get used to it." He<br/>scratched at his neck, just under his pigtail, "So where we goin'?"<p>"To meet Crawford and Nagi," Schuldich smirked, "Or do you not want to<br/>anymore?"<p>"Of course I do!" Ranma snapped, "If I can get out of this hell hole<br/>I'm living in, I will! No matter what I have to do!"<p>The redheaded assassin's smirk widened. Ranma might just regret those<br/>words, but who was he to tell? Ranma had killed before. He would have<br/>continued this train of thought, but he- and Ranma- found themselves<br/>drenched from a spray of water from above. The martial artist growled,<br/>wringing the water from her red chinese shirt.<p>Her?<p>Schuldich proceeded to stare at Ranma for nearly ten minutes, openly<br/>gaping at the sight of a busty redheaded young woman standing where a<br/>black haired young man had been standing. The martial artist looked<br/>down at her equally wet companion and sighed, "Come on. Let's find<br/>somewhere to sit, and I'll 'splain the curse."<p>-<p>"Koneko no Sumi Ie, Hidaka Ken speaking, how can I help you?"<p>Nabiki blinked, rather surprised. She hadn't expected someone she<br/>didn't know answering the phone. Shaking her head, she put the thought<br/>off, "Ah yes, can I speak with Tsukiyono Omi?"<p>"Just a sec. Hey Omi-kun! You've got a phone call!"<p>There was a muffled 'okay' in the background, and the sound of many<br/>girls whining as one, before a breathless voice came across the<br/>phonelines, "Omi speaking."<p>"Hi Omittchi."<p>"Nabs?" Omi's voice sounded surprised, but she had expected that.<br/>Afterall, they hadn't had much contact with one another over the past<br/>three years, excluding the couple emails they shot back and forth when<br/>they needed help.<p>"It's me. Look, Omittchi, I need your help."<p>"You must, if you're calling me instead of emailing," there was a bit<br/>of an amused tease in his voice. As of late, the things Nabiki had<br/>needed help for weren't all that serious. Just some hacked information<br/>in order to keep the 'local loonies' of Nerima out of serious trouble.<p>Nabiki sighed, fisting her hair, "I had to call in a couple favors that<br/>I didn't want to. Ranma and Ranko seem to have come across some old...<br/>friends. Although I'm not sure if I should really use that word. They<br/>took off with one of them earlier this morning, and I'm worried."<p>"You need me to look up some information?" Omi rolled his eyes at the<br/>conversation. Really, why would his old partner get so worked up about<br/>something as little as some friends tracking her two borders down?<br/>Their enemies did it all the time.<p>"I already have. Of course, his friends had to have weird gaijin<br/>names."<p>"So what do you need my help with?"<p>The brunnette shook her head, although Omi couldn't see it, "I didn't<br/>get any information on the two that showed up. Nothing what-so-ever,<br/>even when I searched under Farfello's real name."<p>The young assassin's blood ran cold, and he managed to squeak out,<br/>"Farfello?"<p>"Otherwise known as Jei, with his friend Schuldich," Nabiki stated, a<br/>touch of panic in her own voice. Omi rarely got that squeaky note to<br/>his voice- and she'd known him for over six years, "They showed up<br/>yesterday, looking for Ranma and Ranko by name."<p>"Not good, Nabs. This is not good. Farfello and Schuldich are dangerous<br/>men," Omi glanced around, moving outof sight and dropping his voice. It<br/>wouldn't do to have one of the shop patrons over hear him, "They're<br/>assassins, Nabiki. Whatever they want from Ranma and Ranko means those<br/>two are in danger."<p>"Assassins?" Nabiki hissed back, her own eyes darting to make sure no<br/>one over heard her, "Are you sure it's the Farfello and Schuldich I<br/>saw?"<p>"Schuldich was a redhead with green eyes, right? And Farfello has lots<br/>of scars and an eyepatch?"<p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line, before Nabiki<br/>managed to get out, "Yes. Oh god... I was mad at Ranma, yeah, but..."<p>"Nabiki," Omi's voice was harsh in it's seriousness, a tone Nabiki had<br/>heard several times, but each one had been in some of the most<br/>dangerous situations the two had gotten themselves into, "What exactly<br/>did those two want?"<p>"Kitty."<p>"What?"<p>"Kitty. It's what Farfello was calling Ranma and Ranko. He kept calling<br/>them his 'Kitties'."<p>-<p>A pair of redheads wandered down the streets of Tokyo. The first had<br/>red hair that bordered on orange, and jade eyes. He was also male. The<br/>second, a female, was short and busty, with dangerously narrowed,<br/>stormy blue eyes. She looked about ready to kill something, most likely<br/>her companion.<p>"Bishoujo," Schuldich was still grinning over this new nickname that<br/>just made the boy-turned-girl burn with rage, "it's not a curse, it's a<br/>blessing!"<p>Ranma's glare increased, "Stop calling me that! And it is a curse! Do<br/>you know how many people have hit on me- or tried to kill me- because<br/>of this form?"<p>"And how many of them still try to kill you in your normal form?"<br/>Schuldich shot back with an even wider grin, "besides, you can get a<br/>lot more jobs with an ability like that, Bishoujo!"<p>Schuldich found his face firmly planted in the ground, Ranma shaking<br/>with rage as she retracked her fist. Her lips pulled back in a silent<br/>growl, before she managed to calm herself down enough to talk again,<br/>"Arse. When people find out, I get branded a pervert!"<p>"And you're not, Kitty?" the assassin irritably rubbed his now sore<br/>face, before ducking beneath another attack, "Whoa! Calm down,<br/>bishoujo. All I meant was you live with three lovely young woman, are<br/>engaged to one of them, as well as two other beautiful girls-" yes, he<br/>had gone through Ranma's mind to see what Xian Phu and Ukyou looked<br/>like, "-you can't tell me you haven't thought about it."<p>"I haven't," Ranma snorted, "I'm not interested in them." Before she<br/>could utter another word (along the lines of 'Schuldich-no-baka') a new<br/>voice interupted. Or rather, a whistle interupted.<p>Ready, willing, and able to pound the idiot into next week, Ranma<br/>turned on her heel and found herself face-to-face with a tall, lanky<br/>young man. With brownish blonde hair, and a pair of sunglasses hiding<br/>his eyes, "Get lost."<p>"Ah, is that anyway to treat someone who merely appriecating your<br/>beauty?"<p>There was a snort from the ground, and Schuldich pulled himself to his<br/>feet, "She's only sixteen, Kudou."<p>"You know this jerk?" Ranma asked over her shoulder, looking back at<br/>her companion. Who, she smirked, had a bruise starting to form from<br/>meeting the ground up-close and personal.<p>Schuldich gave a shrug, countance obviously amused, as Kudou Yohji's<br/>eyes narrowed into a sharp glare from behind his shades, "Schuldich."<p>"The one and only. If you'll excuse us, Kudou, Kitty and I have<br/>elsewhere to be." Ranma rolled her eyes at the look Yohji developed.<br/>Hooking her arm through Schuldich's offered one, in a way that was<br/>clearly designed to insult the playboy-ish young man, Ranma smirked to<br/>herself.<p>That is, until Yohji grabbed her arm, tugging her away from the other<br/>redhead, "Schuldich is a dangerous man to get involved with,<br/>Kitty-chan."<p>-<p>"Alright, Nabs, I'll help you find them."<p>"When you do, Omittchi, have them stay with you. They'd be safer with<br/>you than here, considering that those two get into more than their fair<br/>share of fights just by opening their mouths."<p>Omi chuckled, although it was a bit strained, "I understand, Nabs, and<br/>don't worry. We'll-"<p>"Stop being an asshole, I can take care of myself," came a waspish snap<br/>from the front of the store, and Omi had to blink at the sight. A<br/>redheaded young woman was stalking into the Koneko, followed by Yohji.<br/>Yohji had a red handprint decorating his cheek, but he didn't really<br/>look like he cared. In fact, he looked like he was worried about<br/>something.<p>"Omittchi? Omi, are you still there?"<p>"H.. Hai, I'm still here, Nabs. Uh, Ranko is a short, er...<br/>well-developed redhead, right?"<p>Nabiki's voice sounded confused, "You should know that, Omi, I sent you<br/>a picture of both Ranma and Ranko, remember?"<p>"Yeah. Uh, can I call you back, Nabs? Something just came up."<p>"Oh, alright. Just do it soon. I don't have forever, you know."<p>"I know, I know. Bai bai."<p>"Bai bai," there was a click and Omi hung up, turning back to face the<br/>front of the store. The redhead and Yohji seemed to be in a rather<br/>heated, but whispered arguement, punctuated repeatedly, by the redhead<br/>slapping away Yohji's hand every so other, or even going so far as to<br/>kick him.<p>The seventeen year old padded over to where the arguing pair were,<br/>well, arguing heatedly. Their voices became clearer as he got closer.<p>"I told you- I can take care of myself!"<p>"The man you were with is dangerous!"<p>"Schuldich couldn't touch me if he tried!"<p>"You don't know how fast he can be! You're lucky you're still alive!"<p>"What the hell are you talking about? Schuldich is my friend!"<p>"Only until your usefulness wears out! He's a manipulative little-"<p>"And your a stuck up playboy who can't get over the fact that I<br/>couldn't give less of a damn about you!"<p>"Ahem... is there a problem, Yohji-kun?"<p>End Chapter
