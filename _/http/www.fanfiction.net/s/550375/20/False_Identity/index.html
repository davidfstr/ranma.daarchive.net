</div>If you couldn't tell, my computer was back in the shop. It's really<br/>hard to have a working computer when your CPU has literally melted<br/>and destroyed the motherboard. *glareglareglare*<p>Just to prove that, yes, it really was computer problems, Chapters<br/>Nineteen, Twenty, and Twenty-One come out today. Yes, that's right!<br/>I'm posting the chapters that were supposed to come out over the<br/>last two weeks, PLUS this week's addition to the world of False<br/>Identity.<p>At the bottom, there's a list of sites &amp; URLs where False Identity can<br/>be found.<p>Oh, and I want to say congrats to the one who's writing "Wild Kitten".<br/>An interesting take, even if you _aren't_ pairing Ranko and Farfie.<br/>I like what you've written so far. =^-^= Miiiiyah!<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Nineteen: Plans<br/>Li Xiang<p>The sight that greeted Schuldich as he strolled up the road made him<br/>laugh, long and hard.<p>The light of the street lamps glared down on the heads of the two men<br/>tied to the poles- Ken and Yohji. Omi was trying to untie them.[1]<p>It didn't help that Kitty was still whipping water balloons in their<br/>direction. Both she and Aya were seated in front of the Koneko, a pile<br/>of water balloons between them. Aya was grinning faintly, arms crossed<br/>behind his head as glazed over violet eyes stared up at the sky. He was<br/>ignoring Omi's pleas to (a) help him and (b) stop Ranma.<p>Schuldich's laughter caught all but Ranma-onna off guard- Aya's eyes<br/>snapped to his face, Omi stopped untying his friends for a moment, and<br/>a look of nervousness crossed Ken's features. Ranma dropped the balloon<br/>she'd picked up, "Is Jei-sama with you?"<p>"Not tonight, Bishoujo," Schuldich came to a stop in front of her with<br/>a grin, "Rache told me that you and Balinese know."<p>"We do," Ranma nodded, "So does Ken."<p>The redhead nodded, "You going to help?"<p>It was Ken who responded, "Yeah, might as well." he rolled his<br/>shoulders, stretching, as the rope fell to the ground, and Omi stepped<br/>back. Yohji had been tied with a separate piece of rope. The seventeen<br/>year old sighed as he went back to untying his teammate.<p>"What are you talking about?" Aya's voice was soft, but deadly, as he<br/>glared at Schuldich. While he wasn't as... distrusting... towards the<br/>other redhead these days, he still didn't fully trust Schuldich.<p>/The feeling, Abyssian, is quite mutual, I assure you/ Violet eyes met<br/>jade and engaged in a staring contest. It held for a minute, before<br/>Schuldich smirked and broke contact. He turned to face Kitty, "Farf<br/>wants to see you, Bishoujo."<p>"Don't call me that. Where?" She bounced to her feet, and started<br/>forwards. Abyssian stood, as well.<p>"At the 'house," Schuldich's smirk widened, /And where are _you_ off<br/>to, Katzchen?/ he got a sharp glare in return.<p>"I'm coming with you, Ranma."<p>The feline girl hiked an eyebrow, then smirked, "Only if you can keep<br/>up with me, Fujimiya!" Laughing, she darted off. With a bit of a glare,<br/>the still sweater-less man followed at a rather good clip.<p>Ken edged away as Schuldich stepped closer to them with a wicked grin,<br/>"I suggest we go somewhere more... private, if we're going to discuss<br/>our options."<p>Omi looked rather confused- both by Schuldich's"conversation" with<br/>Yohji, and the fact that Ken had place him between the German assassin<br/>and he.<p>Yohji eyed the exchange between Ken and Schuldich, recalling Rache and<br/>Ranma's conversation from the afternoon, "Stop teasing him, Schuldich.<br/>As a point, I don't trust- let alone like- you. Let's go."<p>-<p>It wasn't actually all that hard to keep Ranma in sight- most likely<br/>because he kept to the streets after having gotten some hot water.<p>It was when the young male stopped outside the entrance of a familiar<br/>warehouse that Aya actually came up beside him. The martial artist was<br/>smirking, "I made it _easy_ for you, Abyssian."<p>He didn't doubt it, either. He'd heard Yohji's tale of the fight<br/>between Ranko and Ryouga. He'd seen Ranko's speed during the water<br/>fight. Which reminded him... a quick look down revealed that yes, he<br/>was still shirtless. He felt the unfathomable urge to smack himself.<p>This was certainly the first time something like _this_ had ever<br/>happened to him.<p>Ranma smirked at him, then threw open the warehouse doors, "Are you<br/>here, Jei-sama?"<p>Rache's irritated face bobbed out of the darkness, "Unfortunately.<br/>You've only been gone three hours, and now you're back?"<p>"Calm down, Rache," Aya had picked up Schuldich's habit of using the<br/>name she'd taken before being adopted. She turned a burning glare on<br/>the older redhead.<p>"_You_ put up with Farfie for twenty minutes, and see how well _you_<br/>take it," Rache snipped, then sighed, "Okay, okay, you two can come in.<br/>I wonder if I'm ever going to get those computers in..." The last part<br/>was mumbled as she returned to the darkness, blue duster swirling with<br/>her movements.<p>Aya and Ranma entered the shadows themselves. While normally this would<br/>be stupid and dangerous- they could trip and fall and hurt<br/>themselves- there was nothing to trip and fall and hurt themselves<br/>_on_. The only places furnished were the bedrooms, and the one they<br/>were headed towards had bright light spilling from the open door.<p>When they got there, it was immediately recognizable as Farfello's<br/>room. The walls had been covered with two inch thick foam mats, the<br/>ceiling and floor much the same. A large, four poster bed- complete<br/>with shackles and chains- was tucked into one corner. A nearby chest<br/>lay open, exposing one hell of a lot of wicked-looking torture<br/>implements.<p>And, of course, Farfello himself sat on the bed, drawing patterns in<br/>his arm with a knife. He looked up as they entered, eyes on his Kitty,<br/>not even noticing Abyssian. Said assassin found himself one of the rare<br/>few who saw- not Farfello, by Jei, the original personality- smile in<br/>true happiness.<p>Then, of course, it vanished when his attention was turned on the bare<br/>chested Fujimiya, "...Abyssian."<p>"Farfello," he greeted, equally as awkward as Farfello had. What do you<br/>say to the man who you've actively tried to kill? What do you say to<br/>the man who, despite being an enemy, took care of one of your most<br/>precious belongings?<p>Jei turned an inquisitive eye to Kitty, and the martial artist<br/>shrugged, "He followed me."<p>This caused the pale haired man to burst into laughter, "The assassin<br/>followed the cat home!"<p>Ranma smirked, then dropped onto the bed beside his long-time friend.<br/>Once his laughter had abided, Jei tugged the martial artist into his<br/>lap- or, at least, he tried. Ranma was quite comfortable spread across<br/>the bed, and didn't want to move. Farfello growled lowly, and Aya<br/>interrupted.<p>"Leave him be, Farfello," the redhead had dropped to the floor, seated<br/>cross-legged, "If he doesn't want to move, he won't."<p>Jei gave the older man a dark look, "How would _you_ know, Abyssian?"<p>Violet eyes slid shut and a wry chuckle forced itself out of lips that<br/>_tried_ to refuse the gesture, "I've been living with him for the past<br/>week[2]"<p>"Don't remind me," Farfello growled, jealousy flaring within him. He<br/>knit his fingers in Kitty's hair, and the martial artist slit open an<br/>eye.<p>"Don't talk like I'm not here," Farfello hiked an eyebrow, but Aya's<br/>expression didn't change, "Stop being at each other's throats, too. As<br/>much as I _love_ a good fight, I don't feel like being the cause of one<br/>between the two of you, right now."<p>Jei snorted, "You didn't seem to mind when you were a cause of a fight<br/>for those girls."<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, muttering, "They beat _me_ up just as much as<br/>they did each other. Helped to make Ryouga's punches hurt less."<p>"You let them beat on you... to make it hurt less?" Alright, Aya<br/>decided, Ranma's nuts.<p>"Endurance training," the martial artist shrugged, "Ryouga's one upped<br/>me in _that_- he had boulders smashed into him!"<p>-<p>Outside the warehouse, Schuldich hummed cheerfully, pushing the door<br/>open. Both Yohji and Omi looked a bit wary of being at the warehouse,<br/>while Ken merely looked wary of Schuldich.<p>Scratch that, Ken was bloody terrified of the German, for all his<br/>teasing on the way over. He was using Yohji and Omi as shields.<p>A pair of irritated emerald eyes peered out of the darkness, "What's<br/>with all the visitors tonight, Bruder?"<p>"Hello to you, too, Rache," Schuldich shrugged, "We felt discussing the<br/>deal we've got going would be done best somewhere in... private." to<br/>punctuate hi words, the redhead leered at Ken, and Siberian stared at<br/>him for a moment, before hiding behind Omi.<p>Rache snickered, "Oh stop teasing him, Schu! I think you've tormented<br/>him enough over the last few days."<p>"Ah, you're no fun, Kleine Schwester. Where are Farf and his katzchen?"<p>"You're the telepath, can't you find them?"<p>"I could," he grinned, "But I'm feeling lazy. Lay on, Macduff."<p>Rache eyed him, stating drily, "Don't quote Shakespear,<br/>brother-dearest. Follow the light- Irish, Ranma and Aya are in Farf's<br/>room."<p>"Danke." Cheerful smile back in place, Schuldich guided the Weiss boys<br/>into the darkness. Wary of a trap, Yohji's fingers stole to his watch,<br/>where his monofilament wire was hidden. Omi would have done the same,<br/>had he thought to bring his darts with him- but they'd come straight<br/>from the scene of the water fight.<p>Ken continued oblivious to his friends' nervousness. He'd been<br/>throughout the whole of the warehouse the day or so prior, when<br/>Schuldich had been chasing him. Besides, since Omi was the only one<br/>with him that didn't already know, he supposed it didn't really matter<br/>if he found out about his phasing ability. He'd just go through the<br/>floor if there was trouble.<p>The light spilling from the door was bright in the unlighted warehouse,<br/>almost blinding from a distance. As they came closer, they could hear<br/>Ranma saying something about... boulders?<p>"That must have hurt," Schuldich put in, announcing his presence to the<br/>trio in the room. Farfello frowned.<p>"Why are you here?"<p>Schuldich shrugged with a grin, "I figured we should discuss the deal<br/>with everyone here."<p>"Then where's Nagi and Crawford?" Ranma questioned with a raised<br/>eyebrow, and Jei snickered.<p>"They don't know about it yet."<p>"You're kidding," Yohji still held his kill-wire in a careful grip. He<br/>wasn't about to just _trust_ the men who'd tried to kill him on<br/>multiple occasions- especially Farfello.<p>"Nope," Schuldich shook his head, sending flame toned hair flying,<br/>"Neither Crawford nor Nagi know what we're planning on doing."<p>"I guess that's why Rache said it would be a few weeks," Ranma nodded<br/>to himself, sitting up, "You still have to convince Crawford and Nagi<br/>this is a _good_ idea."<p>Ken edged away from Schuldich- who'd apparently decided to stand right<br/>beside him- and spoke, "Alright, we wait to talk about it until _all_<br/>of Schwartz is here. Can we _go_ now?"<p>Ranma almost laughed at Ken's pain, while both Aya and Omi gave Ken<br/>confused looks. Yohji sighed, shaking his head, "Would you relax, Ken?<br/>Schuldich isn't going to hurt _you_."<p>The implied statement blew completely over Ken's head, as he pulled Aya<br/>between him and the German. Frowning, the violet eyes man snorted,<br/>"What's this all _about_?"<p>"Schwartz agrees to step out of your way to Kill Takatori on two<br/>conditions," Ranma recited, "the first, Weiss leaves Kritiker. The<br/>second, Tsukiyono is _not_ allowed to go anymore near the Takatori<br/>family with intent to kill."<p>Aya and Omi shared a confused 'blink', and Schuldich shook his head,<br/>"As long as it's not Omi who takes out Takatori, Schwartz won't stand<br/>in your way. All we want is Weiss away from Kritiker."<p>A suspicious glare prompted a bit of laughter (from Schuldich, of<br/>course), and a rolling of the eyes (Ranma). After a moment, Ranma began<br/>to explain.<p>-<p>The whistle of displaced air was all the warning Ninomiko Kenji had<br/>before he crumpled to the ground, dead.<p>The katana was raised, a red cloth used to carefully wipe the blood<br/>from the blade, and from black leather gloves. With that complete, the<br/>sword returned to it's sheath in silence. The cloth was tucked into a<br/>small black bag and tucked into the bodice of the red kimono. In the<br/>dark, the crimson tones were muted, but still bright enough that the<br/>black silhouettes of a forest could still be seen.<p>The woman turned away from her target, walking away from the corpse.<p>Once away from the body, a simple cell phone was removed from her obi.<br/>Flicking it on, she hit speed dial, and spoke a short sentence, "Target<br/>Eliminated."<p>On the other end the response was just as simple, "Good. Got to the<br/>pick-up to retrieve the next," She did not say good by, merely ending<br/>the call.<p>-<p>Yawning, Ranma trudged back to the Koneko no Sumi Ie behind Weiss. It<br/>was late- it had taken a while to get Ken out of Schuldich's grip-<br/>and he was tired. A series of late nights and almost constantly in the<br/>feral state of mind was taking it's toll.<p>Enough that, until he heard a scream of outrage, he hadn't realised his<br/>danger sense was blaring at him.<p>"Ranma, for killing my Xian Phu- PREPARE TO DIE!"<p>Weiss whirled at the shout of challenge, gapping in amazement as a<br/>veritable field of chains arched from the darkness, each of the<br/>hundreds of chains tipped with some form of razor sharp blade. They<br/>were directed solely at Ranma, and the boys relaxed for a moment- they<br/>expected Ranma to dodge with all the speed he'd previously shown them.<p>But Ranma had been caught off guard. The martial artist's veneer of<br/>energy and wakefulness had fallen away to leave a worn and tired young<br/>man in his place. His speed had left him as he attempt to dodge the<br/>blades just a little to late.<p>Blades pierced his skin, some scratching, some slicing, and some<br/>embedding in his body as he moved. Pain lanced through his body, and he<br/>gave a horrible screech of pain, not unlike that of a wild beast. It<br/>was his scream that launched Weiss into action. Omi may have been angry<br/>with the gender-bender- for the near-death of Akane- but Ranma was<br/>also a sorta-friend. Yohji was pissed that Ranma had attempted to kill<br/>him- but the martial artist _had_ taken him to Rache.<p>Only Yohji had his weapon on him, so the Playboy followed the chains to<br/>their source- a teenaged Chinese boy. Practiced movements had his wire<br/>arching out not unlike the chains, pinning the young man's arms to his<br/>body, tangling in the wire. For a moment, he mused on the fact that<br/>he'd once done something like this to Aya, before returning to the task<br/>at hand.<p>Without their master, the flung blades clattered to the ground. Omi and<br/>Aya both snatched up some- Omi a handful of throwing knives still<br/>attached to their chains, and Aya a scimitar. Ken moved to Ranma's side<br/>as the bleeding youth collapsed against a wall. With careful hands, he<br/>pulled some of the bloody blades from their human scabbard- others he<br/>left in, to halt blood flow, "Guys, take care of that moron! Ranma<br/>needs a doctor!"<p>"Take him to Naru!" Yohji barked, even as Aya growled, "Rache will know<br/>what to do."<p>Ken nodded, hefting Ranma into his arms, "I've never taken someone with<br/>me when I phase," he muttered to the half conscious youth, "Let's hope<br/>I don't make anything worse, ne?"<p>Ranma gave a pained chuckle, almost snuggling into Ken's arms like a<br/>child.<p>Hesitantly at first, Ken stepped through the wall Ranma had been<br/>leaning against. When the only thing to happen was that the parts of<br/>Ranma's clothing not directly touching him vanished, he broke into an<br/>outright run. Who cared if someone saw him? So they'd think they'd seen<br/>a ghost or two... Ranma's life was on the line.<p>-<p>Back with the rest of Weiss, Muu Tzu was struggling with the wire that<br/>bound him. He didn't struggle hard- the wires had cut through his silk<br/>robes, biting into his skin when he'd tried. He froze completely,<br/>however, when the tip of a sword pressed against his adam's apple.<p>An icy voice practically snarled, "Give me one good reason why I<br/>shouldn't kill you where you stand."<p>"He's not exactly standing, Abyssian."<p>"Quiet, Balinese," a third voice hissed, and Muu Tzu wished he could<br/>see more than blurs in the darkness. The sword pressed closer, and the<br/>first voice hissed, "Answer."<p>"He killed my Xian Phu!"<p>"He killed a bottle of shampoo?" Yohji hiked an eyebrow, and Muu Tzu<br/>snarled, "Xian Phu was her _name_!"<p>Aya's face blanked, "Killing is what assassins do."<p>"Assassin?" Muu Tzu scoffed, "Saotome's no assassin."<p>Without emotion, Aya thrust the sword forwards- and hit nothing, as<br/>Muu Tzu's robes collapsed in on themselves. Yohji gaped, "...the hell?"<p>Aya toed the robes, but there was no sign of the amazon boy. With a<br/>growl, the redhead turned away, "Let's get back to the Koneko."<p>"What about Ranma?" Omi questioned, and his leader turned bright,<br/>violet eyes on him.<p>"Ken will inform us," he snapped, "until then, we'd just be getting in<br/>the way."<p>Yohji and Omi stared at each other, then followed Abyssian back to<br/>their shop. After a few minutes, Muu Tzu's robes shifted, and a duck<br/>waddled out.<p>Thank god, Mu-mu-chan thought, that I had that bottle of water on me.<p>End<p>[1] Yes, this can happen. Heh, about three years ago we tied my brother<br/>and my neighbour up like that in the middle of a water fight. Gen<br/>wasn't to happy about it...<br/>[2] Has it only been a week? Seems like much more time has passed,<br/>doesn't it? Especially with my frequent computer problems. *sweatdrops*<p>Ranchan &amp; Co. - .com/<br/>Lady Cosmos' Fanfic Library - .com/<br/>Strider's Ranma Archive - .com/<br/>Faded Fantasies - http:/li_.com/<br/>
