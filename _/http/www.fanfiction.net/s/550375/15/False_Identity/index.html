</div>A large number of you probably knew this was coming. Mostly those I<br/>emailed with a plea for help, but...<p>Pain is my name, right now. I hurt all over. Warning to people. When<br/>you're a green belt, and the only other green belt in the class is<br/>faster than you, don't go full power. It hurts for a few days<br/>afterwards. I haven't been able to practise without feeling something<br/>hurt. At least I can type without my wrists screaming, ne?<p>_Krypt_ - Our Fuku'd friends won't be showing up... at least not for<br/>a long while, yet.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Fourteen: Dojo<br/>Li Xiang<p>"I wanna get some of my stuff."<p>Jei paused in mid-motion. He set the cup back down on the counter.<br/>The two of them had muscled their way into the bar- really, all<br/>Ranma had to do was flare is battle aura, and they were in.<p>"What do you mean, Kitty?"<p>The first person in the bar who had made a snide comment about the<br/>Kitty/Jei-sama "thing" had to be taken to the hospital. Those who<br/>have seen the so-called "fight" happen, did not tried to (a) do the<br/>same, or (b) kick Jei and Ranma out. Those who weren't completely and<br/>totally plastered, warned new arrivals off.<p>"I mean, I want to go back to the dojo, and get my stuff, and leave.<br/>For good."<p>Jei's face broke out into something attempting to mimic an ecstatic<br/>grin. Any of the patrons who looked at him in that moment turned away<br/>in fright. Farfello was scary, any way you put it, "You'll be moving<br/>in with Schwartz? With me?"<p>Ranma shook his head, "I'm staying at the Koneko until the base is<br/>completed. I _still_ haven't figured out Abyssian. Balinese is a<br/>perv, Bombay an idiot, Siberian's smart; he stays out of my way...<br/>but Abyssian... I don't get him."<p>Farfello shrugged, "I don't either, and I've known him longer than<br/>you."<p>"I think he's got a crush on 'Ranko'," Ranma declared after a moment.<br/>Jei stiffened, eye slitting dangerously; Ranma didn't notice, and<br/>continued blithely, "From everything I've overheard, he's been acting<br/>seriously out of character."<p>"I hadn't noticed," Jei growled. Kitty was _his_- male _and_ female<br/>forms- and he wasn't about to share his pet with anyone. Especially<br/>not someone from Weiss!<p>"You don't live with him. Any ways, if we go to the dojo now, maybe<br/>we'll miss the Tendous. That'll be nice. Unlikely, but nice."<p>Ranma bounded to his feet, dropping some of the money he'd earned as<br/>Xue Shi on the table. Jei shook his head, downing his alcohol-<br/>Guinness; he'd never gotten used to the taste of sake- and stood to<br/>follow his pet.<p>Unlike Ranma, he _hoped_ to run into the Tendous. Specifically Akane.<br/>For what _should_ be obvious reasons.<p>-<p>Two shadows- one a bit taller than the other- drifted through the<br/>darkness, to alight on the wall around the Tendou-ke. Neither made a<br/>sound as they paced the wall, searching to see if those within were<br/>awake.<p>Through the windows, the forms of three teenaged girls, and a panda,<br/>could be seen slumbering.<p>The first of the shadows dropped lightly onto all fours, outside the<br/>porch doors. It stood, the pale light of the moon obscured by clouds,<br/>leaving the form in shadows. Silence surrounded it as it slipped into<br/>the home. The second shadow didn't move.<p>Instinct took over, and the shadow moved at a quick pace, easily<br/>moving around furniture, suggesting familiarity with the place. After<br/>a second, the shadow darted up the stairs, and entered the room of<br/>one of the teenagers. It was barely within two feet of the door<br/>before a flashlight clicked on.<p>"Omittchi? The hell..."<p>"Shh!" the seventeen-year-old glanced around nervously, "Do you want<br/>to wake your family up?"<p>"The only one we have to worry about is Kasumi," Nabiki grumbled,<br/>sitting up, "Daddy and Ran...ko's father drank themselves silly, and<br/>Akane worked herself to exhaustion. Now... what are you doing in my<br/>home at," she glanced at her clock, "One in the morning?"<p>The assassin settled onto her bed beside her, "Business; Kritiker<br/>needs their best info-hacker to crack this disk," he held out a CD,<br/>"Weiss retrieved it a few days ago on a mission. I took a look at it,<br/>and couldn't figure it out; so I give it to Manx. She said to try you<br/>after failing to crack it."<p>"How much?"<p>"Normal rate, plus two percent," Omi grinned, "So you'll do it?"<p>"You'll keep Ranko and Ranma out of trouble?"<p>Omi sighed, "We'll _try_ to keep Ranko out, but we haven't seen, let<br/>alone met, Ranma yet."<p>There was the sound of a body slamming into a wall, and the house<br/>shook. Omi and Nabiki bounded to their feet- Nabiki grabbed a robe-<br/>and ran out of the room. As they flew down the stairs, Nabiki<br/>muttered, "I think you'll meet him soon enough."<p>-<p>Outside, Yohji shook his head out, climbing to his feet from where<br/>he'd been slammed into the wall. Across from him, stood a pair of<br/>shadows; or rather, one stood, and one was getting up from a crouch.<p>The porch lights flicked on, flooding the backyard with light.<br/>Farfello's silver-haired, gold-eyed form was familiar. The other man,<br/>however, was not. Black silk clung to his legs, while a red silk<br/>embroidered with a black dragon wrapped around his torso and upper<br/>arms. Black leather gloves encased his hands, and Ranko's familiar<br/>leather collar was tight around his throat.<p>His stormy blue eyes were identical to Ranko's, but where he hair was<br/>brilliant, the red of freshly spilled blood, his was darker than the<br/>darkest shadows of the night. He, like Ranko, had hair tied back in a<br/>braid.<p>"Ranma!"<p>"Hey Nabiki," the man- Ranma- greeted with a smirk, "How's<br/>business...?"<p>"Get away form that man!" she called from the porch door behind Omi,<br/>"He's dangerous!"<p>Ranma lifted his hands into the air, with an expression of<br/>exasperation, "How many times do I have to hear that? It's annoying!<br/>You know damn well I'm just as dangerous..."<p>"You've never killed before," Omi was making an assumption here. From<br/>what Nabiki had told him, this was true. How could it have changed in<br/>less than a week?<p>"Saffron," Ranma's voice was cool, as he declared the demi-god's<br/>name, "I pierced his heart with an icicle, as we fought. He died.<br/>Sure, he was reborn, but that's the way of the Phoenix. I still<br/>killed him."<p>"That was for self-defense," Nabiki pointed out with a growl- why<br/>was Ranma trying to defend a known murder? "You've never killed in<br/>cold blood!"<p>"We prefer to call it hunting." Farfello's gaze was bone chilling as<br/>it settled on her, "My Kitty is a magnificent hunter, drenched in<br/>blood, proclaiming his victory over God and man, screaming with<br/>bloodlust..."<p>"I thought Ranko was 'Kitty'," Yohji muttered, fingering his watch.<br/>He was itching to loop his wire around the Irishman's neck, to<br/>finally be rid of him. Ranma shot the older man a look of disdain.<br/>Jei smirked, and Nabiki dropped her head.<p>"Oh my, we have guests!"<p>The tableau was broken, as Kasumi stepped up behind her sister, "Oh!<br/>Ranma, you're back!"<p>"Hey Kasumi," Ranma shrugged, "Just grabbing me and _Ranko's_ stuff."<p>"Hi Kasumi-neechan."<p>"Hello Omi-kun. Won't you come in? I can make some snacks..." the<br/>keeper of the Tendou-ke drifted back into her kitchen; Ranma<br/>followed, darting around Omi and Nabiki with a cheerful chant of<br/>"Food!"<p>Jei snickered, following closely behind his pet. Omi and Yohji<br/>snapped out of their dazes in time to go in after the middle Tendou<br/>sister. The sight that greeted them was not what they expected.<br/>Ranma, Jei and Nabiki were seated at the table- Ranma and Jei at one<br/>end, Nabiki at the other. Ranma was leaning against the Schwartz<br/>assassin with a faintly amused smirk. The assassin's left hand had<br/>woven itself into his Kitty's hair, as his gold eye held Nabiki's<br/>gaze.<p>Nervously, Omi and Yohji settled themselves on either side of the<br/>Tendou girl.<p>Ranma spoke, "So, what are the twit twins doing here?"<p>"Ranma," Nabiki growled, eyes darkening in anger, "First, don't call<br/>Omittchi a twist. Second, what business is it of yours?"<p>The ebony-haired boy shrugged, "Whatever. I just want to get my stuff<br/>and leave."<p>"And how do you think you'll support yourself?" Nabiki knew she had<br/>him cornered. He didn't have a job, and to mention the Koneko would<br/>merely make Yohji and Omi suspicious. After all, they had never met<br/>Ranma before.<p>"What business of it is yours?" Ranma mimicked, and Farfello<br/>snickered. Nabiki's glare prompted Ranma- trained for the past two<br/>years he'd lived with her- to speak, "I've got a good job; pays<br/>pretty nicely, too. Probably more than the twin morons get."<p>"Ranma!"<p>"What? You said not to call Tsukiyono a twit, not a moron."<p>Nabiki's glare intensified, "Let's put it this way, Ranma, don't<br/>insult them, in _any_ way."<p>Ranma snorted, "So Ranko's allowed to tease them, but I'm not? How<br/>unfair is that?" Again, Farfello chuckled, drawing his Kitty closer.<br/>Neither young man moved as Kasumi entered the room, bearing a plate<br/>of mochi.<p>"Try not to stay up to late, Nabiki, Ranma. You have school in the<br/>morning?"<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, turned to Jei, and whined, "Do I _hafta_?"<p>"No," Jei gave the martial artist a grin, "You're coming home with<br/>me."<p>"Where's Ranko?" Everyone turned to Yohji. He was frowning, "You said<br/>she was with you. Where is she?"<p>"Not here, Playboy," Ranma gave him a nasty smile, ignoring Nabiki's<br/>sharp look, "Why? You got a crush on her, or something?"<p>"He better not," Jei growled into Ranma's hair. Yohji snorted.<p>"Doubtful. I just want to know what you did to her!"<p>Jei, finally, spoke aloud, "She's gone. Non-existent, but not dead.<br/>Hidden beneath another face, the blood washed form her hair..." he<br/>snickered at that. He could understand why Schuldich thought mind<br/>games were fun to play.<p>Nabiki's face paled, "He knows?"<p>"Jei-sama knows everything," Ranma's grin was terrifying in it's<br/>malevolence. Both Yohji and Omi missed the exchange, as the oldest of<br/>Weiss lunged across the table, knocking Ranma away to tackle<br/>Farfello.<p>"WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER, BASTARD?"<p>Jei thrashed, throwing Yohji off, climbing to his feet with a feral<br/>growl. Blood dripped from where the madman had bit his tongue upon<br/>receiving Yohji's tackle.<p>Ranma, too, snarled. A feline hiss escaped his lips, eyes narrowing<br/>into thing slits. His fingers curled into claws, sparks of raw ki<br/>flickering over his hands. He bound to his feet, from where he'd been<br/>thrown.<p>"We did nothing," Ranma snarled, "She did it herself... and _NO_ONE_<br/>attacks Jei-sama!"<p>This time, it was Ranma who lunged at his target. Yohji dodged out of<br/>the way, placing himself in front of the door to the kitchen. Ranma<br/>landed on one foot, bracing himself for a second with a hand- and<br/>leaving gouges in the floor boards from the ki claws that had<br/>extended from his finger tips- before twisting and leaping once<br/>again. He shot forwards, ramming Yohji through the door with one<br/>shoulders, and one hand. Blood pooled around the ki claws for a<br/>moment, when they actually touched the White Hunter's skin, they it<br/>was spraying into the air as the claws tore free, taking a rather<br/>large piece of skin, and some muscle with it. Yohji had been hit with<br/>enough force to drive him across the kitchen, through the wall, and<br/>out into the middle of the backyard.<p>Ranma followed through Yohji's newly made exit, Jei, Nabiki, Kasumi,<br/>and Omi racing after.<p>The Saotome boy lazily dodged a punch from the retaliating Yohji- it<br/>had to have been painful, for the assassin was using his torn arm.<br/>Again, and again, the assassin lashed out as Ranma tagged him. Each<br/>"tag" left a new wound, with more blood dripping from them. Drawing<br/>back, Yohji looped his wire around his fingers. He'd finish this<br/>fight.<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed as he caught a glimpse at the wire on his<br/>opponent's hands. They flew at one another, once more.<p>The ebony-haired teenager lead off with a sharp kick to Yohji's gut.<br/>The assassin dodged, loosing his wire in an attempt to ensnare<br/>Saotome's head. Ranma ducked, dropping his shoulder to body check the<br/>older male into the air. He followed up by launching himself after<br/>his opponent, twisting in mid-air, and slamming Yohji with another<br/>kick.<p>As Ranma dropped lightly to the ground, Yohji crashed into the koi<br/>pond- and sent a wave of water in Ranma's direction. The martial<br/>artist scrambled backwards, but, as usual, could not avoid the wave.<p>Ranko stood, sopping wet, in Ranma's place. She growled, wringing out<br/>her hair, muttering obscenities at the world.<p>Omi and Yohji gaped at the familiar flame haired form where Ranma had<br/>stood. Jei snorted, moving forwards to wrap his arms around her<br/>waist, "Looks like the 'secret' is out."<p>"Yeah," Ranma crossed her arms a bit miffed, "I was really hoping it<br/>would stay a secret a bit longer."<p>"You're a water magnet, Saotome," Nabiki grumbled, "You had to know<br/>this would happen sooner, rather than later."<p>"Wha... Bu... no way... HOW?" Omi's shout snapped Yohji out of his<br/>daze and the twenty-one-year-old pulled himself free of the koi pond.<p>"Ranko?" he muttered, "Ranko is Ranma?"<p>"Yes," the redhead former male sneered, "Ranko is Ranma. Ranma is<br/>Ranko. We're the same person."<p>"How...?" Omi repeated plaintively, "Ranko's definitely female-" for<br/>some reason, he blushed here, "- and Ranma's definitely male.<br/>Breasts that big can't possibly be bound that flat!"<p>Ranma gave the youngest of Weiss a strange look, "You've been staring<br/>at my chest, Tsukiyono?"<p>"Uh..." with the look he was getting from Farfello- who was still<br/>wrapped around Ranma- he didn't know how to answer. To say yes, was<br/>to die by Ranma and Farfello's hands. To say no, meant that Farfello<br/>would kill him for the thought that Ranma-onna wasn't good enough to<br/>be stared at.<p>Omi figured Farfello would just use any excuse to kill him, in front<br/>of Ranma. Normally, he'd have attacked by now.<p>"That doesn't matter!" Yohji snapped, stepping close enough to the<br/>redhead that Jei growled at him. Yohji ignored the madman in favour<br/>of glaring at Saotome, "How the hell did this happen? One moment<br/>you're Ranma, the next, Ranko!"<p>Ranma smirked haughtily, in Yohji's direction, before turning back to<br/>the Tendou home, "Figure it out, Play boy. Or you could ask Nabiki<br/>here. I've got bags to pack."<p>Pulling free of her master's arms, Ranma sauntered back into the<br/>home. Jei paused long enough to pull his knife out, and finger it,<br/>staring at Weiss. Then he, too, entered the building.<p>-<p>A spark of red in the darkness caught the driver's attention. After a<br/>moment, the form of a young woman exited the building he was parked<br/>in front of. She looked to be about eighteen.<p>Shinji rolled the window down, as she stepped up to the cab, "You the<br/>lady who ordered this junk?"<p>"It's not junk," the redhead stated coolly, "But yeah, I ordered it."<p>"Good. I was starting to think I'd got the wrong address," Shinji<br/>rubbed her forehead, "this area isn't the safest place to be at<br/>night, you know."<p>"I'm aware of it," her voice was calm as he exited the cab. The pair<br/>walked in silence as they moved to the back. Shinji's partner, Seito,<br/>had already unlocked and pulled the doors open. The woman smiled at<br/>what was inside.<p>"If you don't mind me askin'," Seito started, "What in the world do<br/>you need _sixteen_ computers for?"<p>Green eyes danced, and she smiled a bit whimsically, "Well, there<br/>_are_ going to be ten people- possibly more, we're not positive on<br/>whether Xue Shi wants to move her band here, yet- living here."<p>"Sushi?" Shinji hiked an eyebrow, as he hefted a cardboard box into<br/>his arms, "Isn't she one of those idol singers?"<p>The woman smirked again, "She hates being called 'Sushi', but yes,<br/>she is." She directed Shinji and Seito into the building, and pointed<br/>to the large office to the right of the small one where Ken had been<br/>held two days prior, "You can put them in there. I have things to do,<br/>so when you're done, you can find me in the room beside the office."<p>-<p>"Well, that's about it," Ranma muttered, shouldering his pack, having<br/>changed back before coming up to pack his bags. It hadn't taken much<br/>more than ten minutes to pack his things. Two years living in a home<br/>didn't break the decade old habit of not unpacking his bag, for fear<br/>that he'd have to leave suddenly. It helped that Ranma didn't have<br/>much in the way of worldly possessions. The Saotome Katana- he<br/>_still_ didn't know its name-, his tanto, and his collar were really<br/>all he owned, that he really cared about. And they were always,<br/>_always_, on him.<p>He had packed more than that, of course. His clothing, sleeping bag,<br/>and futon, went into his pack. Various trinkets he'd picked up over<br/>his stay went in, as well. The few manga he'd found himself<br/>religiously following, and hiding from prying eyes, went too. Jei's<br/>comment on his tastes in "comics" had him beet red for several<br/>minutes.<p>"About time," the Irishman grumbled, "I want to kill something."<p>"Hurt Yohji," Ranma muttered, a bit distracted. This had gone better<br/>than he had hoped. In fact, he thought it had gone _too_ well. Luck<br/>was _never_ on his side. The shit was about to hit the fan, seeing as<br/>it had been building up over the past few days. It felt like things<br/>were about to go critical. Soon.<p>Farfello grinned widely, and bounded down the stairs. Ranma followed<br/>at a more sedate pace, at least, until a familiar, female shriek of<br/>pain, split the air. Ranma bounded down the stairs, growling to<br/>himself.<p>Couldn't this have waited, oh I don't know... a few _YEARS_?<p>For, standing there, dressed in pajamas with an expression of pure<br/>terror on her face, was Akane. And she had a knife jammed through the<br/>back of her left shoulder.<p>End<br/>Aren't I evil?
