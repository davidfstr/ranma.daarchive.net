</div>I have some pretty sick readers.<p>Glad to have you aboard ^-^V<p>Now, this is where most people would write which couple is at the head<br/>of the "race". I won't do that. I never do that. You'll just have to<br/>wait and see as to the couples that come out. If it's the couple you<br/>favor, kudos to you. If not... better luck next time.<p>I don't like Akane, but I don't really want to have all the flamers on<br/>my ass, so I just made her a semi-bitch. She's still conceited though.<p>I am aware Aya is OOC here. He's aware of it too, and it's confusing<br/>him. ^-^V<p>Oh, yeah: Hajime means 'begin fight' in karate.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Seven: Hajime<br/>Li Xiang<p>The trail of broken underbrush and shreds of cotton cloth caught by<br/>said brush ended abruptly at the base of a large tree. Gouges in the<br/>bark were testament to exactly where the perpetrator had gone.<p>Jei frowned, staring up into the branches where, only a few short<br/>minutes ago, a bird had screamed its death to the world. Apparently,<br/>Kitty had been hungry.<p>The boy's frown turned into a scowl as he fit his own fingers into the<br/>ripped up bark, hauling himself up. Just as he was crawling up onto a<br/>branch to find his Kitty, a blur shot through the leaves. It slammed<br/>into his chest, knocking him from the branch to the ground.<p>The golden-eyed youth failed to make the connection between something-<br/>or someone- landing on him, and what should have, but wasn't, pain<br/>upon impact with the ground. Shoving the younger boy off of him via<br/>thrusting his hand into the other's face, Jei's hand came back slick<br/>with crimson wetness.<p>"Christ..." as much as the boy had a fascination with blood, he wasn't<br/>in the mood to deal with his mother freaking on him over it. With a<br/>sigh, he moved to wipe the blood off on a leaf.<p>However, a certain "neko-fied" eight year old had other ideas, and<br/>caught Jei's hand between his teeth.<p>"Kitty. Let go," gold eyes flashed irritably, "I've gotta wipe the<br/>blood off."<p>Kitty refused, instead brushing his tongue across the part of Jei's<br/>hand in his mouth, lapping at the blood.<p>-<p>Ranma awoke to the taste of blood tingling on the tip of his tongue. It<br/>was his own- he'd tasted the sharp, metallic tang many times over the<br/>years. He'd also tasted the, slightly different, tangs of others' blood<br/>as well: his father's, from a sucker punch when his father's knuckles<br/>had been split; Ryouga's from biting through the skin, during junior<br/>high, when the larger boy had grabbed him in a full nelson; and, of<br/>course, Jei-sama's, eight years earlier.<p>He- no wait, she- pushed herself into lotus from her futon. It had<br/>been quite sometime since he'd awoken, peacefully, in female form. It<br/>would be longer still until he could assume his natural form for the<br/>majority of his time.<p>After approximately three minutes worth of meditation, Ranma began to<br/>get antsy. He'd been taught to meditate, years and years ago, to<br/>control his then, periodic and out of control rages, as well as his<br/>-at times- all-encompassing fears of nothing. His father hadn't<br/>liked the idea of mediation all that much, and had attacked him every<br/>time he tried to do so. Then again, that right there might have been<br/>the part of the problem of his rages.<p>And then, there was Nerima, where he was being attacked, night and day.<br/>No time to rest, let alone be able to mediate. Not yet having been<br/>interrupted was making her nervous.<p>The dawn's light was filtering in through the window shade, splashing<br/>across her temporary roommate. Today, they would finish clearing out<br/>the spare room. It had been used to hold various items, including, of<br/>all things, three broken crossbows, seven yards worth of monofilament<br/>wire, and eighteen separate soccer balls. There were other things in<br/>there- some nearly destroyed clothing that had been tossed in there<br/>instead of being thrown out, the odd book, a couple sets of weights and<br/>other such items.<p>They'd removed a good deal of it the other day, but not enough for<br/>Ranma to have slept in there. Once they finished cleaning out the room,<br/>Ranma would be able to move the futon out of Aya's room, and into the<br/>spare. Of course, Ranma would be required to work for the Koneko while<br/>she stayed- it was one of Aya's stipulations to letting her live with<br/>them.<p>Finally sighing in disgust, Ranma flipped from full lotus to her feet<br/>in a rather amazing, if pointless, feat of flexibility. She had<br/>admitted to herself that it was unlikely that she'd be able to calm her<br/>mind enough to get into the state of mind needed to reach her center,<br/>and settled for pulling her red Chinese shirt on over the undershirt<br/>she'd worn the day before.<p>"I need more clothing," she grumbled half-heartedly, taking a tentative<br/>sniff of her shirt. It smelt like sweat, and, while Ranma had little to<br/>no feminine modesty, her mother had pounded into her head that women<br/>and body order did not mix.<p>She pulled the dragon whisker from her hair, grasping it in her teeth<br/>as she ran her fingers through her hair in an attempt to comb it out,<br/>before giving it up as hopeless. The hair had tangled in her sleep, the<br/>pigtail having not been tied as tight as it normally was. The whisker<br/>came from between her teeth to knit around her fingers as she padded<br/>out of Aya's room in search of a brush.<p>Not all that long later, Ranma was seated on the kitchen counter,<br/>munching on the last of an orange she'd liberated from the cupboards,<br/>while attempting the apparently impossible. She was trying to french<br/>braid her hair. She couldn't remember who had shown her the picture,<br/>only that it was an effective way to keep her hair from falling loose<br/>of the low pigtail at the nape of her neck.<p>"Dammit, why can't I do this!"<p>"A mirror might help," came Omi's voice, and Ranma's gaze flickered<br/>over to him for a moment, before turning to stare at the counter beside<br/>her, "Look. I'm sorry about yesterday. I... guess I didn't really think<br/>about how you might feel about me badmouthing your friends."<p>"You can badmouth them all you want, because I don't have friends. I<br/>have people who want to kill me, people who want to marry me, and<br/>people who like me, but will probably want to kill me at some point in<br/>time," was the sharp retort, and Ranma focused inwards on herself to<br/>attempt the braid again. Omi sighed, walking over to her. Ranma shifted<br/>so she wouldn't have to look at the older boy- this had been the<br/>reaction Omi had been aiming for, snagging the ruby red strands of hair<br/>from her fingers, and began to knit them into the style she'd been<br/>attempting by herself. Ranma's back stiffened in anger.<p>"Relax, Ranko. I've done this before," he blushed slightly, remembering<br/>how Ouka had tricked him into french braiding ninety percent of her<br/>friends' hair, "It's not as hard as you think, but it helps to have a<br/>mirror, if you're doing it for yourself."<p>When Omi tied the braid off the with dragon's whisker- it was the only<br/>thing to tie hair with near by, seeing as all Yohji's hair ties were in<br/>his room- he dropped the braid to smack lightly against the back of<br/>the girl's neck. She turned to face the blue eyed boy with a tight<br/>smile, "I... well... thank you... for helping me..." as he started to<br/>smile, her expression turned rather icy, "But that doesn't mean I've<br/>forgotten that you tried to keep me and Jei-sama apart. I don't bother<br/>you, I expect you to not bother me, got it?"<p>"I... yes, I understand," Omi ran through a list of curses in his mind.<br/>He'd been hoping that being nice to her would make her stop being quite<br/>so cold to him. As such, he'd gotten up earlier than usual to start<br/>clearing out the spare room for her.<p>And that would be his escape now, from the chilling eyes focused on<br/>him, "Ah... I'm going to go finish cleaning out the spare room."<p>"You do that."<p>The assassin fled the room, and the martial artist pursed her lips,<br/>leaning back against the cabinets over the counter she was still seated<br/>on. Crossing her arms beneath her breasts- still, even after two years,<br/>it felt funny to have that weight seated on her limbs- she gave an<br/>irritated sigh. Ranma focused her icy gaze at the floor, and felt the<br/>tension being drawn out of her. She could honestly understand that Omi<br/>was trying to get her forgiveness.<p>The problem was, that he'd hit on one of the few things that Ranma did<br/>not forgive. Jei-sama. Just as he'd broken some of the "given" rules of<br/>his life in Nerima by hitting Nabiki for her thoughtless jest of Jei a<br/>mere week ago, he would break a few more and not forgive Omi nor Yohji<br/>for their attempts to... "rescue" her.<p>She didn't know how long, exactly she'd been sitting there, only coming<br/>around to realize time had passed when someone cleared their throat.<br/>Aya stood in front of her, staring her down with a mixture of<br/>curiosity and annoyance.<p>"Get down."<p>Ranma smirked at the older man, "Hmmm... no."<p>The violet eyed assassin's lips thinned, eyes narrowing sharply at the<br/>refusal, "Get off the counter, Ranko." He was being unusually nice to<br/>her, he noted to himself with a bit of detached amusement in his own<br/>mental voice. Why?<p>"Why should I?"<p>The redheaded man gave her a flat stare, and she responded with a<br/>cheeky grin. Their staring contest was held for five or so more minutes<br/>before the violet eyed one's hands lashed out to catch Ranko by her<br/>waist and haul her bodily off the counter. She gave a short, laughing<br/>shriek as fingers came in contact with the ticklish skin of her<br/>stomach- one of the things she absolutely hated about her female form.<br/>She was undeniably ticklish.<p>"Dammit, Aya! Put me down!"<p>Aya's lips twitched, and he uncharacteristically carried her over to<br/>the table to drop her in a seat, "Sit here, not on the counters."<p>In the doorway of the kitchen, Ken and Omi stared wide-eyed at the<br/>pair, before exchanging a set of shocked looks. That was not something<br/>they had expected to see.<p>-<p>Noon. Lunch.<p>Ranma's stomach growled, and she set the latest set of plants she'd<br/>been ordered to carry around on a counter, and bounded across the store<br/>to give Ken a set of pleading, puppy-dog eyes. It was a technique she'd<br/>perfected, specifically for getting food out of unsuspecting teenage<br/>males.<p>Ken, being one of said unsuspecting teenage males, turned to her and<br/>got a full face of the cute-as-a-button-puppy-dog-eyes glittering at<br/>him. It was almost worse than the group of fangirls that normally<br/>surrounded him- that were absent this lunch hour, something he was<br/>thankful of. Many of the near-by schools had started regulating who got<br/>to go on and off campus during lunch hours, considering how many girls<br/>left the grounds to storm the Koneko no Sumi Ie.<p>"Keeeeen, I'm hungry."<p>He winced at the petulant tone in her voice- he could understand why<br/>she wasn't bothering Aya again: he wouldn't have taken to well to her<br/>whining, "There's nothing I can do about that, Ranko."<p>"But I'm hungry," she forced a bit more of a whine into her speech,<br/>"and I want something to eat..."<p>"There is a coffee shop across the street, Ranko."<p>The whine and the look vanished, "Oh for... I want real food, baka."<p>"Ask Aya."<p>"He's bus-"<p>"Ranko!"<p>The redheaded teenaged girl sighed, and gave Ken a small wave,<br/>resolving to figure out exactly how Ken was immune to her puppy-dog<br/>eyes. She turned towards the counter, where Aya was standing, hand<br/>lightly resting on the edge, "You bellowed?"<p>"You can go out and find food," the pointed look he gave her told her<br/>quite clearly that she needed to lower the decibels the next time she<br/>whined about being hungry, "after you deliver these."<p>Three blood red roses were arranged with a set of shockingly purple<br/>toned blue bells, wrapped in a shimmery paper. It rested on the counter<br/>where Aya had, obviously, put it together. She picked it up, rather<br/>delicately, and gave her "boss" an odd look.<p>"Delivery? Me? Aya, I haven't even been here for twenty-four hours!"<p>"Yohji, Ken and myself are busy with other things. This is the<br/>address," the sheet was passed to her. Ranko shook her head, looking<br/>down at the sheet. That was practically on the other side of the<br/>district!<p>"And I can get lunch after I deliver these?"<p>"Yes."<p>Her lips quirked, and she sketched a small bow before shucking off the<br/>apron she'd been forced into that morning. Then, she was gone, vanished<br/>out the door with a speed the assassin had only ever seen in Schuldich,<br/>before. Yohji stepped out from behind a display of plants, "I'm going<br/>to follow her, Aya. Make sure she's not going to get into any trouble."<p>"Aa."<p>-<p>"A restaurant?" Ranma scratched the back of her head with the hand not<br/>occupied holding the bouquet. She'd been expecting a house, or an<br/>apartment, or, hells, even the hospital. Not a restaurant. Shrugging to<br/>herself, she prepared to enter when a voice caught her attention.<p>"Would you calm down?" Attention caught, Ranma turned to face it, and<br/>found herself ducking into the alcove made by the door. One of the few<br/>people she'd rather not see was standing not to far away- Akane, his<br/>fiancee. She was wearing a rather tasteful blue dress, not one he'd<br/>seen before. Not that it mattered, Ranma couldn't really care less<br/>about the girl now: he had Jei-sama back, after all.<p>With her as an uncomfortable looking Daisuke; Hiroshi wasn't around,<br/>and Daisuke was actually dressed up nicely. Daisuke was the one to<br/>speak, "I'm sorry Akane-chan, it's just... with you being engaged to<br/>Ranma..."<p>"Who cares about the pervert?" the short haired girl snorted, "Daisuke,<br/>look at me. It's been three years!"<p>"Three and a half."<p>"And you still doubt me?" Akane shook her head, "Never mind. Where are<br/>you taking me?"<p>Daisuke made a motion to the restaurant that Ranma was using to hide<br/>herself, "Welcome to the Royal Dragon, Akane," he blushed a bit, "I<br/>made an order to get you flowers... but they're not here yet."<p>"Flowers?" a sweet smile crossed her lips and she hugged the boy tight,<br/>"I bet they're just beautiful."<p>"Personally," Ranma called, "I'm not one for roses and blue bells."<p>Both boy and girl froze as Ranma sauntered out of the shadows, smirking<br/>and carrying the bouquet. She bowed, handing them to Akane, "Consider<br/>this a gift. The engagement is off, Tendou."<p>The girl in blue flushed a deep crimson suddenly, "But... I thought...<br/>you said... and the wedding...!"<p>The redhead flicked the metal tag hanging from the leather collar<br/>around her neck, but said nothing, leaving Tendou Akane stuttering on<br/>the sidewalk; pride wounded. With a shrug, she turned on her heel and<br/>knit her fingers behind her head, humming some song she'd heard on an<br/>anime. With the engagement to Akane off, maybe Ryouga would stop being<br/>such an ass?<p>A bare block later, that thought was derailed by a familiar, and not<br/>all that unwelcomed shout, "RANMA! PREPARE TO DIE!"<p>-<p>Yohji cursed. He hadn't been close enough when following her to hear<br/>what she'd said to the couple outside the restaurant, but he'd doubted<br/>anyone in Tokyo had missed the large boy's shout. Although... why was<br/>he calling her 'Ranma'? Omi had said that was her brother's name. Maybe<br/>he got them messed up?<p>Yohji, of course, had never actually seen a picture of Ranma.<p>-<p>As the dust began to settle from the lost boy's entrance- bakusei<br/>tenketsu had been used on the ground in front of Ranma- the street was<br/>quickly vacated. Just because they were no longer in Nerima did not<br/>mean people didn't know when something bad was going to happen.<p>Tokyo just had that aura after all. Although, usually in the weirder<br/>districts, like Nerima, or Juuban.<p>"Hey Ryouga, long time no see."<p>Ranma was standing, perfectly balanced as always, atop the railing that<br/>separated street from sidewalk. There were a few tears in her shirt and<br/>pants from flying debris, but no actual injuries to herself. She'd been<br/>through the attack enough times that it didn't really hurt her anymore.<br/>Her opponent shot her a dark glare, opening his mouth to say something,<br/>before the realization sunk in.<p>"You're dry."<p>Ranma blinked. That wasn't how things were supposed to happen. Ryouga<br/>was supposed to get angry and attack her for no good reason, and they'd<br/>fight, cause some mass property damage, maybe hurt someone (hopefully,<br/>Ryouga himself) in the process, before Ryouga got lost and vowed to get<br/>his revenge on some later date, all the while calling Ranma a coward.<p>Ryouga was not supposed to comment on whether or not Ranma was wet or<br/>dry.<p>"... yeah, so?"<p>"And you're female."<p>Was that what this was about? "Again: Yeah, so?"<p>A nasty little smirk crossed his rival's face, "Are you... trapped?"<p>The redhead rolled her eyes, "No. Yes. Maybe?"<p>"..." Ryouga gave her a look, and Ranma held up her hands, opening her<br/>mouth to respond defensively. Fortunately for the near by businesses,<br/>who would have been destroyed in the fight which would have resulted<br/>from Ranma's response, someone who hadn't vacated the premises,<br/>responded for her.<p>Unfortunately for him, he dug himself deeper into the hole he was<br/>already in.<p>"Hey Ranko, who's your friend?"<p>Her eye twitched, and she gave Yohji a dour look, before growling,<br/>"Kudou. Were you following me?"<p>The brunette suddenly seemed to remember that 'Ranko' didn't like him<br/>all that much. Or at all, for that matter. He tried his 'lady-charmer'<br/>grin, "Oh, come on, Ranko! Schwartz is still after you and-"<p>"Schwartz?" Ryouga interrupted, turning an rather interested gaze on<br/>Ranma, "My bastard of an uncle's bodyguards?"<p>This time, both Yohji and Ranma gave the lost boy an odd look, and he<br/>blushed brightly, "I... shouldn't have said that."<p>"Why's that?" Ranma shuddered, she and Yohji were speaking in tandem,<br/>now. She'd rather that they didn't. In fact, she'd rather that Yohji<br/>would just go away, or better yet, incite a fight between her and<br/>Ryouga and get caught in the middle. Therefore, he'd get grievously<br/>injured, locked up in his room, and she wouldn't have to see him!<p>It was a wonderful plan. Now, just how to pull it off...?<p>Ryouga scratched the back of his head, "Reiji- that's my uncle- cast<br/>my mother out of the clan when she married my father. If dad hadn't<br/>taught mom his family's style of martial arts, she would have been dead<br/>on my uncle's orders."<p>"Man, Ryouga, your family's more fucked up than mine," the redhead<br/>announced. She held her breath, hoping that the line would send Ryouga<br/>off into one of his rages. A spark of anger lit in his eyes, but it<br/>wasn't enough. Not yet, at least...<p>"Shut up... 'Ranko'," the name was sneered, and Yohji gave the pair an<br/>odd look as Ranma flushed brightly, and Ryouga gave a triumphant smirk,<br/>"Schwartz has tried to kill off my whole family under Reiji's orders,<br/>even me. That one eyed freak with the-" Ryouga promptly found himself<br/>on his ass, staring up into the enraged eyes of one gender-bending<br/>martial artist, who was straddling his chest.<p>"Don't you ever, _ever_, call Jei-sama a freak again," she hissed, the<br/>white of pure, raw ki flickering over her fingers, almost hesitantly<br/>leaping forwards to curl into small, pearl claws, before returning to a<br/>pure energy form.<p>Ryouga's eyes lit with the oh-so-familiar look of rage, hurtling Ranma<br/>off of him, "I should have known you'd be in with a _freak_ like him!"<p>Ranma gave him less than a second before she was pounding into him,<br/>fists flying at ameguriken speeds, hissing and spitting as her mind<br/>gave into the Cat.<p>End
