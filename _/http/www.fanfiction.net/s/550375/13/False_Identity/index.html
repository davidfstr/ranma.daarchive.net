</div>Rave - Kiss me if you want. I don't care. *grins*<br/>Katoru - Yes, Oz, as in the Oz played by Seth Green. I like Seth<br/>Green. Yes, it's the Wolfboy. This is actually a plot point. Take<br/>note of this, peoples.<p>Anyways, with Spring Break having happened, I got a little behind on<br/>my writting. Not on Shiva, as for those of you who have read it know<br/>that I got two chapters up in only a couple days, when I said it<br/>would be two or three _weeks_ between updates. I'm a bad girl.<p>But, Chapter Thirteen is half-way done. Jei meets Xian Phu. That's<br/>all I'm going to say.<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Twelve: Kunous<br/>Li Xiang<p>Ranma crawled into her room via the window, cloaked in the Umisenken.<br/>They'd continued to make plans well into the night, up until Ranma<br/>had proclaimed he was about to drop dead on his feet, and returned to<br/>the Koneko no Sumi Ie. She'd left her credit card and pin number with<br/>Schuldich- or actually, he'd plucked the numbers from his mind and<br/>gave them to Rache.<p>With a tired sigh, she sunk down into her bed and fell asleep.<p>-<p>Shaking his head, the eight-year-old stood shakily. He then threw<br/>himself at the boards that held him in place. A brand new dog collar<br/>was tight around his throat, an old chain hooked to it. This chain<br/>was bound around a tree, and wooden boards had been set up to keep<br/>him trapped.<p>Jei stood outside the boards, staring down at his pet. Bandages<br/>bounded his arms, while his clothing had small dark spots where blood<br/>had seeped through the fabric, "You've been bad, Kitty."<p>The ebony-haired boy hissed at him and Jei frowned, "Until you<br/>behave, you're not leaving." He can remember his mother using this<br/>tactic on him.<p>He'd gone an entire day, once, before apologizing for hurting his<br/>sister. Kitty would just have to learn what he was allowed to do, and<br/>what he was not, the same way Jei did.<p>Nodding to himself, Jei turned, and walked away.<p>-<p>Ranko was jerked out of her sleep, eyes snapping open as she surged<br/>to her feet. There was nothing that should have awakened her in the<br/>room. Expanding her senses, she searched for a reason for being<br/>pulled from her sleep.<p>Aya, Yohji, Omi and Ken were asleep in their rooms; obvious, first,<br/>from the lack of noise, and second, from what she could sense of<br/>their auras- they were stationary. For a split second, she thought of<br/>thanking Happosai for "training" her to sense his aura, just so she<br/>could avoid him. The moment passed swiftly, and she banished all<br/>thoughts of Happosai to the back of her mind where they were shot<br/>several hundred times.<p>Slipping from her room, Ranko paced the floor, peering quietly into<br/>her housemates' rooms. There was nothing, nothing at all, that should<br/>have been enough to have woken her. Finding no solution to this<br/>problem, she padded back to her room, hissing softly in irritation.<p>Entering her room, she froze.<p>This was what had awakened her; and she knew that it was her fault<br/>for not checking outside her window. Eye twitching slightly, she<br/>pulled her shirt up and over her nose, before moving silently toward<br/>her "gift".<p>The bouquet of black roses was promptly thrown out the window, while<br/>the redheaded young woman retreated from the room. She should have<br/>known Kodachi would know every flower shop in Tokyo; not to mention<br/>the fact that Kodachi, or her servants, would have recognized her.<p>And with Ranma out of Nerima, with Akane, Ukyou and Xian Pu still<br/>there, Kodachi would automatically believe that "the red haired<br/>hussy"-who, considering she _was_ Ranma, would not be in the<br/>district, either- was at fault. Who knew what other tricks the<br/>psychotic gymnast had left for her!<p>Not even bothering to take a pillow or blanket, the redhead set off<br/>for the only other place in the Koneko that she knew she'd be able to<br/>sleep- Aya's room.<p>-<p>Aya stirred, but did not wake as Ranko rose to her feet the next<br/>morning, six o'clock sharp. Drawing herself up, she slipped from his<br/>room, silent as any ghost. She has a mission.<p>A mission that, admittedly, didn't actually _need_ the glass of ice<br/>water she'd procured. Still moving without sound, she slipped into<br/>Ken's room, glass behind her back.<p>He was sprawled across his bed, having fallen asleep in the boxers<br/>and T-shirt he'd been wearing when Weiss had returned. A devious<br/>smile lit her lips as she leaned over, "Time to get up, Hidaka."<p>Ken mumbled something about demons, then rolled over. Her smile<br/>turned into a full fledged 'as-evil-as-they-come' grin, "You've got<br/>ten seconds, Ken, then it's bath time."<p>Still no movement. She counted down from ten, out loud, then tipped<br/>the glass over his head. Following this, she put her free hand across<br/>his mouth, to prevent any noise from escaping to alert the rest of<br/>Weiss. She didn't want them to barge in, and interrupt her "mission".<p>Ken sat up, shoving her hand away, and attempted to get his wet hair<br/>out of his face. Once that was reasonably accomplished, Ken turned to<br/>face the one who'd awoken him.<p>Ranko perched on the edge of his bed, with a strangely serious look<br/>on her face, "You gonna explain, now?"<p>His sleepily confused look would have been cute, but Ranko ignored<br/>facts like that, having long practice in doing so. She blew a breath<br/>of air through her teeth in irritation, "Fuu. The chain thing,<br/>Hidaka. How'd you go through it?"<p>"Uh... Ranko, could we talk about this later?" his voice dropped to<br/>such a level that even Ranko's Neko-ken-enhanced hearing had trouble<br/>making it out, "Preferably somewhere that isn't likely to be<br/>monitored by Kritiker."<p>She blinked, "Are you tryin' ta get out of explainin' to me?"<p>Yes. "I just... don't like people knowing." Well, that was true<br/>enough. Ken's sleep-fuddled mind stumbled onto something else, "Hey!<br/>I thought you'd left with Schwartz!"<p>"I did," she responded absently, "but I came back." standing, she<br/>left the room with a frown.<p>"That part, I knew," was Ken's dry response to her back. He shifted a<br/>bit, glaring down at the wet spot in his bed, "Now how am I going to<br/>get back to sleep?"<p>-<p>Ranko had pushed all the furniture in the mission room against the<br/>walls. She was dressed in a loose blue shirt that fell just past her<br/>hips, and a pair of sweat pants, seeing as her regular work out<br/>clothes were still at the Tendou Dojo.<p>As usual, she started warm-up with a few light stretches, and a<br/>couple karate kata. Chi-kata to put power back into her moves via<br/>dynamic tension, Pidan Nidan and Pidan Sandan to make sure her<br/>balance was still perfect after three days without practice. Then she<br/>flew into one of the beginning kata of the Founding School of<br/>Musabetsu Kakatou Ryu.<p>At quarter to seven, she heard movement above, but ignored it, as she<br/>continued to run through a number of ground-based kata. The ceiling<br/>was preventing her from performing any of the air-based ones.<p>It wasn't until the sounds of hyperactive fangirls filtered down<br/>around seven thirty that she came to a halt. It wasn't all that long<br/>of a practice- only an hour and a half, but she was tired of<br/>thinking in circles about the same things. Besides, she was getting<br/>hungry.<p>Padding up the stairs, she nodded a greeting to Ken, then vanished<br/>into the kitchen. Once her hunger had been sated- Weiss would have<br/>to go shopping soon- she returned to the room she'd been given.<br/>Without thought, she scribbled a note and taped it to the door.<p>It read, in messy katakana, which was barely legible, "Going out<br/>tonight. Sleeping. Go away."<p>-<p>The fact that someone was banging on the door pulled her from her<br/>slumber. Rache growled low in her throat, but stumbled to the single<br/>apartment's door in the short, six steps it took.<p>"What?" the girl all but snarled into the face of the unsuspecting<br/>brunette outside her door. The taller woman jumped in surprise.<p>"Naru...?"<p>"What do you want, Kino?" Rache scrubbed at her forehead, glowering<br/>at her neighbor. Why did she have to see this woman, _now_? All she<br/>wanted to do was sleep, and maybe abuse Ranma's- sorry, Xue Shi's-<br/>charge card.<p>Kino was frowning, but handed her a white card; "It's your invite to<br/>the wedding."<p>Rache took the card; and frowned, "Don't expect to see me there,<br/>Kino," without bothering to say goodbye, she slammed the door shut.<br/>The card was tossed to the top of her kitchenette's counter, and she<br/>dropped herself back onto her futon. Eyes shut, she was asleep before<br/>her head hit the pillow.<p>Outside, Kino was still staring at the door, "That was rude."<p>"That's Rache for you," a nasal voice came from behind the brunette.<br/>Whirling, she found herself nose-to-nose with a red haired man who<br/>bore a striking resemblance to the woman she'd just spoken to,<br/>"Always a bitch when she's been up all night."<p>"Who are you?" Kino lifted her fisted hands into a guard position.<br/>The man laughed.<p>"Schuldich."<p>Kino started as he blurred, then vanished.<p>-<p>"Sleeping beauty awakes!"<p>Ranko shot Yohji one of the darkest glares she had ever summoned,<br/>lips drawing back in a sneer, "How'd the girls take your<br/>disfigurement, Kudou?"<p>Sore spot! Ranko crowed to herself as Yohji's expression darkened. He<br/>didn't respond, and she pushed past him, tugging on a pair of<br/>oversized black leather gloves, "I'm going out. Don't expect me back<br/>until tomorrow."<p>And then she was out the door and down the street. It was only a<br/>couple moments later when Manx entered the shop.<p>-<p>The phone, Oz noted, was ringing. Not unusual. However, he was unable<br/>to get the phone. Oz was dying his hair, again. With a shrug, the<br/>teenaged guitarist decided that it was up to Fei to get it.<p>Fei, on the other hand, was so involved in his video game that he<br/>couldn't _hear_ the phone. Three more rings, then a click, and the<br/>answering machine picked up, "Oz? Oz, answer the damned phone! I<br/>_know_ you're there!" several moments of silence, then, "Alright...<br/>Fei? You there? Hey, Wu Fei!"<p>Fei's head snapped up, "My name is _Li Fei_! Not _Wu Fei_, Sushi!"<p>"It's the answering machine, idiot," was Oz's call from the bathroom.<p>"Oh," now alerted to the plight of their caller, Fei paused his game<br/>and lifted the receiver, "My name is Chang Li Fei, not Chang Wu Fei,<br/>Sushi."<p>"Then don't call me Sushi," came the female voice, "It's about time<br/>you picked up."<p>"Playing video games," was the response, and a silence that screamed<br/>"I should have known that. I really should have know that" from the<br/>caller. Said caller spoke again after several moments of this.<p>"Look. Tell Akira I have to take a rain check on that recording<br/>again. Family business and all that."<p>The Chinese teen blinked, "Alright... does it have something to do<br/>with last night?"<p>"...yes." And no more. Not even a 'bai-bai'. The line was just dead.<br/>Fei looked at the receiver a bit surprised.<p>"Wow. _Must_ be important. We usually get into a fight before she<br/>hangs up."<p>-<p>Ranma, in male form, stood silently behind, and slightly to the left,<br/>of Jei. He was wearing his regular Chinese outfit, although the blood<br/>red tunic bore an embroidered black oriental dragon on the back. The<br/>black leather gloves that had been falling off his delicate<br/>female-form's hands fit snugly to his callused male-form's hands.<p>They stood around the gate at the Narita Airport, awaiting Reiji's<br/>arrival with his "Old Friend". According to Crawford, they would then<br/>retire to the friend's home for the night, before returning to<br/>Reiji's own home, most likely drunk.<p>Ranma's meeting with Nagi and Crawford had been rather anti-climatic,<br/>comparing to the events of the last few days. It was hard to believe<br/>that it had been less than a week since Crawford had sent Schuldich<br/>and Farfello to Nerima to pick up Kitty.<p>When Kitty had meet Crawford, Oracle had greeted him, zoned out for<br/>moment in a vision, then gave the confused martial artist a tight<br/>smile. Nagi had greeted him with a nod, then returned to his<br/>computer. An hour later- as well as a phone call to a certain<br/>"pilot"- and they were out of the door and on their way to the<br/>airport.<p>They had been expecting two tanned men in suits- Reiji was a rather<br/>serious businessman, after all. However, what they got was two men,<br/>laughing loudly, as thought drunker than hell, wearing colorful,<br/>floral print T-shirts and shorts. Not to mention flip-flops and<br/>sunglasses.<p>Ranma groaned. It wasn't loud enough for the men to hear, but<br/>Schwartz did.<p>"Something wrong, Bishoujo?"<p>Ranma didn't get a chance to answer Schuldich's question- Reiji's<br/>"old friend" saw him.<p>"What you doing here, Keiki?" This brought Reiji's attention to the<br/>ebony-haired boy.<p>"Who are you?"<p>"Saotome Ranma, Sir," surprisingly, there was no tone in the boy's<br/>voice, "I work for Farfello-sama."<p>"You don't work," the old friend- Kunou Pauline - snorted. Ranma<br/>did gain a tone when he responded to him. One that was designed<br/>specifically to prompt fights. It was one he'd used all the time back<br/>in Nerima.<p>"With all do respect, _Sir_, you've been in Hawaii for the past two<br/>months. Things change." He fell silent then, returning to "natural<br/>stance"- feet shoulder width apart, hands loosely fisted, and held<br/>in front of him, about hip level- behind Jei.<p>End<p>(I wanted to go further, but I just couldn't figure out where to go...)
