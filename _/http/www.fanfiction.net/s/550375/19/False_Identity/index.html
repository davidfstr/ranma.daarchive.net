</div>Welcome to Chapter Eighteen.<p>I still need a prereader. Why has no one volunteered? Have I... Have I<br/>lost all my readers? *sniffles* NOOOOOOOOO!<p>Eh, yeah, I'm being melodramatic.<p>I just finished my last exam about three hours ago (at 10:00am, June 20),<br/>so I'm offically in grade twelve now. *dances* Only one more year of high<br/>school left, then it's off to some post secondary education place. Either<br/>an art school or a tech school, but who cares about that? There's still a<br/>year before then...]<p>False Identity<br/>Chapter Eighteen : Games<br/>Li Xiang<p>Rache stirred into wakefulness, desperately trying to cling to her<br/>sleep. She hadn't slept so well in _years_. The eighteen-year-old<br/>snuggled deeper into her pillow, unwilling to get up.<p>As conscious thought returned to her, Rache froze. There was a weight<br/>across her shoulders... and she could recall collapsing against Yohji...<p>Emerald eyes slit open, and Rache found herself curled against Yohji,<br/>staring at his shirt. Blushing, the redhead looked up into Kudou's<br/>face- he was still asleep.<p>"How cute," came a sarcastic voice, and Rache jerked out of Yohji<br/>sleep-loosened embrace. Ranma, in female form, was leaning against the<br/>doorframe. Rache's blush deepened.<p>"Ah... Ranma... I, uh, collapsed before I finished healing him. This'll<br/>take just a moment."<p>She set her hands on the cast again, taking only a moment to find the<br/>place of the wound. Two minutes of using her ki to finish healing the<br/>bone to a point where it wouldn't break very easily, and she lifted her<br/>hands. The glow didn't fade from her fingertips, until after she'd run<br/>them down the stitches in Yohji's forehead.<p>Ranma had watched avidly, ki senses on high, trying to figure out how<br/>she'd done her healing "trick". There was something more than ki flowing<br/>through Rache when she healed. The ki encased the unknown energy, made<br/>it easier to wield and control, although the power was wild- chaotic,<br/>even.<p>"Why'd you fix the scar?"<p>"I healed the skin," Rache sighed, "I'm not very good at healing- most<br/>people are afraid of it- and most wounds I heal leave scars."<p>"Whatever. I've got to bring Playboy here back to the Koneko, but<br/>there's no way in hell that I'm going to carry him."<p>With a wry grin, Rache climbed to her feet, "Then you can check out<br/>your room here."<p>The two redheads padded out of the room, and Yohji slit an eye open. A<br/>faint smile crossed his lips as he lifted his non-cast encased arm to<br/>rest the back of his head on his hand.<p>-<p>Ranma was practically drooling.<p>There was a bed on one side of the room- former office, really- with<br/>an empty fridge nearby. Tatami mats covered the floor, walls, and even<br/>ceiling. A punching bag hung in one corner, and a large window was on<br/>the far wall.<p>Her room looked like a training room! Excitement thrummed through her<br/>and she almost giggled. This was so awesome! She could practice whenever<br/>she wanted, day or night... life was good.<p>"...can't move in for a couple weeks or so, at last guess," Rache was<br/>saying, "We need you to get Weiss away from Kritiker, if what Schuu tells<br/>me is correct."<p>"Huh? What's Schuldich tell you?"<p>Rache plopped herself down on the bed, watching as Ranma began a kata,<br/>bouncing around, and brushing her fingers lightly against the<br/>warehouse roof- a good eight meters up. The German girl shrugged, "You<br/>know that Tsukiyono isn't Omi's _Real_ family name, right?"<p>"Say what?" No, Ranma hadn't known that...<p>"You didn't? Oh well, it's not. Omi isn't really named Tsukiyono Omi,<br/>according to the info Schuu pulled from the minds of Kritiker. _And_<br/>Kritiker plans on having Omi take out his half-brothers."<p>"You're shittin' me," Ranma scoffed. Rache snorted.<p>"Am not. Omi's been trained to kill his family. He's a Takatori,<br/>after all, even if he doesn't know it," Rache shrugged, "Schuu figures<br/>that since Schwartz has been charged with protecting Takatori- and Estet<br/>wants the _whole_ Takatori family alive- that means keeping Omi from<br/>killing his family, and therefore, keep him away from Kritiker."<p>"And Aya's safe because neither Jei-sama or me want him dead before we<br/>can figure him out," Ranma nodded in understanding, "Schuldich has the<br/>hots for Ken, so he'd want Siberian kept safe-"<p>"You have _got_ to be kidding!"<p>The two redheads turned to see Yohji standing in the doorway, staring<br/>at Ranma.<p>"Kudou."<p>"Yohji!"<p>Yohji made a face, "Schuldich likes Ken? Our Ken?"<p>Rache nodded, "Großer bruder has been infatuated with Hidaka since they<br/>met, Yohji. He's just doing something about it _now_ because he can."<p>Ranma's stormy eyes had narrowed sharply, "How much of our conversation<br/>did you hear, Kudou?"<p>"That Omi's a Takatori," Yohji frowned here, "How'd _that_ happen?"<p>"Well," Ranma stated dryly, "Omi's mother spread her legs for Takatori<br/>and-"<p>"Ranma!" Rache gave him a startled stare, and the boy-turned-girl<br/>grinned.<p>"Hang around Hiroshi and Daisuke for awhile, Naru."<p>Yohji shot Ranma a glare, then stared at the floor, his emotions<br/>warring. On one hand, was Weiss staying with Kritiker. Omi would have to<br/>kill him family- granted, he didn't _know_ they were family, but family<br/>was family. On the other, Weiss could get away from Kritiker with<br/>Schwartz's help. It would leave the corrupt Takatori family still in<br/>power, though. That would mean more innocent people would die...<p>"If Weiss went with Schwartz..." Yohji started hesitantly, "...would<br/>we become part of it?"<p>"No," Ranma plopped herself onto the bed beside Rache, "Schwartz isn't<br/>going to last much longer- they're pulling out of the contracts with<br/>their current employers, and will 'vanish' much like Weiss will if we<br/>pull this off." She couldn't believe it! She was actually speaking<br/>_civilly_ with Kudou?"<p>Yohji scratched his chin, "So... it would be possible to still<br/>eliminate Takatori?"<p>Rache shrugged, "If you want to, however, up until Weiss leaves<br/>Kritiker, Schwartz will prevent any attempts, Afterwards, Schu'll agree<br/>to help as long as it's not Omi sent to kill him family."<p>"Why's that?" Both Yohji and Ranma looked confused. Rache sighed.<p>"After he was picked up by Estet, Schuu was sent to kill our parents<br/>and siblings; that's why he calls himself Schuldich, "The Guilty One". He<br/>doesn't want to put anyone through that guilt."<p>Ranma shrugged, "I can understand that. As much as I'd like to run the<br/>Panda through Mom's katana, I'd feel a bit guilty over killing the<br/>man who raised me. There's no way in hell I'd lift a hand against<br/>Ofukuru; she's pretty blood thirty, actually..."<p>"Probably where you get it," Rache muttered, openly to get smacked<br/>upside the head, "Ow. Look, Ranma, you and Yohji should return to the<br/>Koneko soon. It's getting late..."<p>Ranma nodded, "Alright. See ya Naru. C'mon Playboy."<p>"Don't call me that!"<p>"I'll call you whatever I want to, _Playboy_!"<p>-<p>Nabiki sat beside Omi, setting her chopsticks down, having finished her<br/>mean, "I can't believe he's not back yet..."<p>"Don't be, " Ken smiled widely, "Ranko, er... Ranma, takes off like<br/>this all the time. She... he and Yohji probably just got into a fight<br/>again."<p>"Pfft, ye of little faith," came the snort from the door, "Whatcha<br/>doing here, Nabiki?"<p>Ranma- back in male form- stood beside Yohji. The lanky assassin<br/>entered the room with a grin- cast and stitches gone. There was a scar<br/>where the cut on his face had been, but his arm looked brand new.<p>"Ranma..." the teenager in question growled, not even _noticing_<br/>Yohji's healed state, "You son of a BITCH! I'll kill you for letting<br/>Akane get hurt!"<p>"You can try," Ranma grinned wickedly, "But you can't do anything on<br/>_that_ leg."<p>Nabiki glowered at the former freeloader, praying the teen would drop<br/>dead from the look alone. A smirk spread across her face after a moment,<br/>"_I_ don't have to kill you. Ryouga will, once he finds out what you<br/>_let_ happen to Akane!"<p>"Do you honestly believe _he_ can kill _me_? Nabiki, how easily you<br/>forget..." Ranma's lips curled into a sinister smile, "... that Ryouga's<br/>been trying to kill me for two years. He hasn't succeeded yet."<p>"Ooooh!" Nabiki grit her teeth, "C'mon Omittchi. You're taking me<br/>home."<p>The girl tried to stalk out of the room, limping, and Omi followed with<br/>an apologetic look towards Ranma, that the martial artist ignored.<br/>Instead, he turned to Ken, "Where's Aya?"<p>"Out," Ken shrugged, "Don't know where. Why?"<p>"Doesn't matter," Yohji draped his arm over the nineteen-year-old's<br/>shoulder, "We can run it by you, to see if you've got any better ideas."<p>Ken blinked. Yohji and Ranma were getting along? For a moment, he<br/>wondered if the apocalypse was coming again, before banishing the<br/>thought. Apocalypses had an annoying habit of being prevented, "...what<br/>are you talking about?"<p>"You see," Yohji began, "We've come across some very interesting<br/>information."<p>Ranma stuck his hands in his pockets, "An' using' this information<br/>could end in two ways..."<p>Ken looked more confused than ever, "Can't you two talk straight?"<p>"I suppose," Ranma smirked, "but to quote you... I'd rather talk where<br/>Kritiker can't hear us."<p>Comprehension dawned, "Ah, big secret, then?"<p>"Big Secret," Ranma agreed with a nod, "We bring you somewhere to talk<br/>in private, you finally tell me how you do those tricks of yours, you<br/>got it?"<p>"It's a deal," Ken stood, "We'll hafta leave a note for Aya, before we<br/>go."<p>The three men left the building ten minutes later, headed for Juuban<br/>park. When they got there, they settled down beside the lake, Ranma's<br/>senses on high to detect anyone in hearing range.<p>"It's about Omi," Yohji began, before Ken could ask, "and Schwartz."<p>"Omi's got connections to Schwartz?"<p>Ranma knitted his fingers behind his head, and lay back on the grass,<br/>"Schwartz- or rather, Schuldich- wants to keep Omi from killing his<br/>brothers."<p>"Whoa, whoa, Omi's got _brothers_?"<p>"Yeah," Yohji leaned against a tree, "Omi's a Takatori."<p>"Wha... what?"<p>Ranma nodded staring at the sunset lit sky, "Tsukiyono doesn't know,<br/>Ken. Schwartz knows, we know, and Kritiker know, but Kritiker doesn't<br/>know that we know."<p>"Where does Schwartz come into this," Ken settled for sitting down<br/>between the other two, "You said it had to do with Schwartz."<p>"We need to make a clean cut with Kritiker. Leave them behind- if we<br/>do that, Schwartz agrees to step out of the way, and we can do whatever<br/>we want to Takatori," Yohji explained with a tight smile.<p>Ranma's lips quirked, "And Omi's not allowed to go anywhere near<br/>Takatori with the intent to kill."<p>"You made a deal with Schwartz? How do you know we can trust them not<br/>to kill all of us- well, you, I know, Ranma- but what about Weiss?"<br/>Ken was chewing his bottom lip nervously. He was _positive_ Farfello<br/>would try to kill him at first chance.<p>Yohji had to suppress a smirk, "Aya won't get killed until _after_<br/>Farfello and Ranma here figure him out, Omi won't get killed because he's<br/>a Takatori and Schwartz' employers want _all_ Takatori's alive, and you<br/>won't get killed because Schuldich likes you."<p>"Likes to torment me, you mean[1]," Ken muttered, "What about you,<br/>Yohji?"<p>"Naru won't let him get killed," Ranma rolled his eyes, "Now Ken... you<br/>get to tell me _and_ Yohji how you go through things."<p>"...what _are_ you talking about, Ranma?"<p>The sixteen-year-old turned to the scared man, "Ken's got this ability<br/>to go _through_ objects."<p>"You're kidding..."<p>"He's not," Ken crossed his arms with a sigh, "I was... in an accident<br/>a few years back, before I entered the J-league. A building<br/>practically collapsed on me..."<p>"So you're like... dead?"<p>"You've been watching to many videos, Yohji," Ken rolled his eyes, "I'm<br/>very much alive, thank you very much. No, the reason for the building<br/>collapsing was supernatural..."<p>"So," Ranma concluded, "That supernatural thingy transferred its power<br/>to _you_ and you got out alive."<p>"The first time I ever phased," Ken agreed, "scared the hell out of me.<br/>I _Swear_ I thought I was dead."<p>"How'd you figure out you weren't?" Yohji hiked his scarred brow. It<br/>was possible Ken was really a ghost... he shot the voice that told him<br/>that he had to stop watching midnight-to-dawn horror movie marathons.<p>"I had a pulse, I still hurt from things hitting me when the building<br/>collapsed, and I was still bleeding rather profusely."<p>"Could have been a kuei," Ranma pointed out, and Ken made a face.<p>"I didn't even known what a kuei _was_ back then. Besides, if I was<br/>kuei, I wouldn't have been able to _leave_ the building site, and I'd<br/>still have all the bleeding wounds I died from," Ken snorted, "In any<br/>case, I'm alive, I can phase through any non-living or dead object, and<br/>the only people who know are you two and Schuldich."<p>"And we won't tell until you give us permission," Yohji nodded, and<br/>Ranma scowled.<p>"Aw, C'mon! It's good blackmail material![2]"<p>-<p>'Aya-<br/>Gone out to talk in private.<br/>Omi's taking Nabiki home.<br/>-Ken, Yohji, Ranko'<p>Manx frowned, holding the note in hand. None of Weiss was currently<br/>home... she'd have to come back the next day to inform the boys of their<br/>next mission.<p>She set the note back on the table and left, locking the door behind<br/>her. Exactly two minutes after she'd returned to her car and drove away,<br/>Ken came flying around the corner, ducking.<p>A water balloon shattered on the wall beside him, and he whirled.<br/>Another water balloon flew- this time, from his hands- to send a spray<br/>of water up into the day's rapidly fading light.<p>"Bonzai!" Ranko howled, as she dropped from a light post, raining tiny<br/>water balloons down on both Ken and Yohji- who'd come around the corner,<br/>whipping balloons at Siberian.<p>All three were thoroughly soaked, wet clothing sticking to their<br/>bodies as they played. Neither Ken nor Yohji had goofed off like this for<br/>a long while. To play like little kids was something lost to them.<p>Of course, the only reason that Yohji and Ken were currently teaming up<br/>to drench Ranko, was a fluke. The former male had spotted a few lonely<br/>water balloons left out by some kid going to dinner.<p>He'd felt the irresistible urge to whip one at the back of Kudou's<br/>head. They'd swiped the rest of the balloons to attack each other- Yohji<br/>and Ranma, of course- when Ken had vanished. Neither noticed... up<br/>until the point a water balloon hit both of them in the face.<p>Ken had been standing there, grinning innocently, all the while holding<br/>a shopping bag full of water balloons. From there, all out war occurred.<br/>It would be a long time before anyone forgot the twenty-one-year-old,<br/>Nineteen-year-old, and the sixteen-year-old acting like six year olds.<p>Ranko cocked her arm back, whipping it forwards to unleash the three<br/>balloons she'd held in hand. One hit Yohji, the other two landing on the<br/>ground to either side of him, splattering his pants with more water.<p>"What are you doing?"<p>Ranko spun around, ignoring the impacts of the two water balloons that<br/>nailed her in the back, "Hey Aya! Join the war! Be my partner! We can<br/>double team Ken and Kudou!"<p>The male redhead blinked, then leaned to one side to see Ken and Yohji<br/>waving at him with matching cheerful smiles, and bags of water balloons<br/>attached to their belts. Ranko didn't have one- but she did know the<br/>Hidden Weapons technique.<p>The urge to refuse and be his normal, icy cold self, was beaten by the<br/>cheerful, hopeful expression on his teammates and Ranko's faces. He<br/>growled a bit to himself as he found himself stripping off his orange<br/>sweater. It _was_ his favorite, and he didn't want to ruin it, "Let me<br/>put this inside."<p>"Yes!" Ranko cheered, spinning around, "Oh yeah, we're going to beat<br/>you two into the ground! You have _no_ chance!"<p>Yohji's eyes narrowed, "Then we'll just have to take you out before Aya<br/>gets back."<p>Ken gave a sadistic grin, lofting a _very_ large water balloon, "Oh<br/>yeah..."<p>"Do your worst!" Ranko shrieked the challenge happily, dodging out of<br/>Yohji's attack. Another shriek split the air as Ken's icy cold "bomb"<br/>shattered against her shoulder blades.<p>The victory didn't last long before Ken found himself soaked clear<br/>through to the bone. Aya dropped the empty bucket on the ground, smirking<br/>slightly, "And the battle was joined..."<p>Ranko's laughter echoed into the night.<p>-<p>Muu Tzu collected his weapons, using their chains to draw them into his<br/>sleeves. He adjusted his glasses, dropping them over his eyes to see if<br/>he'd hit the target. Half the weapons thrown had, the rest had ripped<br/>up the groove.<p>"Muu Tzu."<p>He spun around, "What do you want?"<p>Khu Lon stepped from the shadows, "Xian Phu is dead."<p>"WHAT?"<p>End<br/>[1] Someone's in denial.<br/>[2] Ranma had to have learned _some_ things from Nabiki.
