</div>'Older'<p>"I would, Sis, I REALLY would if I could," Akane whined on the phone. Behind her, her family continued to eat dinner at the diningroom table, surrupticiously passing glances towards the wife and mother.<p>"[Akane,]" the other end demanded ugently, "[it's getting worse by the moment. I don't even think Nabiki realizes what's going on with her.]"<p>"Kasumi, I want to help out, it's just that..." Akane cast a glare at her husband, who continued eating as if he were oblivious to his wife's aggrivation.<p>"You know, Akane, your curry just seems to get better and better everytime!" Thomas commented turning to her and giving Akane a nod of appreciation. Their two boys both nodded, while drinking almost equal parts milk along with their meal.<p>"Dad, can we hide the pepper, please?" Bruce pleaded.<p>"Now, now," Thomas lightly scolded, "You know full well your mother would just find a substitute..."<p>Akane fought the urge to throw something in her husband's direction; he was rubbing off on their children in a bad way, "Sorry, Kasumi."<p>"[Akane, Akane, Akane...]" Kasumi tsked indisapproval, "[Is my little sister really that tightly controlled by her husband? This is your sister we're talking about. Surely he would understand, not that you should HAVE to explain things to him...]"<p>Akane's expression grew stern. Kasumi was right, this was a family issue that needed to be taken care of. Her husband knew full well what had happened to Nabiki a while back, so why was he acting so casual about all this?<p>"Dear," Akane started in her most assertive, and threatening, voice.<p>"No"<p>"Thomas."<p>"No."<p>"THOMAS!" The almost gutteral growl was enough to send most sentient beings scurrying for safety.<p>"Pass me more rice, please." Steven complied with his father's wishes, well used to his mother's spats.<p>Akane growled at being ignored, and picked something up that wouldn't give unsatisfyingly against her infuriating husband's head.<p>"I'll end up with custody of the children if you do..."<p>Akane stopped cold, before tossing the iron skillet into the sink, and emitted a defeated sigh.<p>_<p>The eldest of the Tendou sisters had to wince at Thomas's implied threat. Kasumi once again was forced to realize that regardless how strong her ability of manipulation happened to be, his was still much stronger.<p>"[Kasumiiiii!]"<p>Kasumi pursed her lips at her sister's helpless plea, "Alright, I'll keep you posted if anything... major happens. Hopefully I can keep from going too far, assuming Nabiki doesn't get her head screwed on straight before then."<p>"[My hand are tied here, thanks Sis.]"<p>"I'll talk to you later. Bye, Akane." Kasumi hung up the phone, somewhat irritated for having to get up that much earlier to recruit assistance from her sister, yet having it effectively countered. Unfortunately, she had no means to fight as dirty as Thomas could.<p>Nabiki wasn't one that was easily coerced, even by Kasumi's best efforts, so even attempting to steer her in another direction was a lost cause. The only advantage Kasumi even knew she had was that the fact hadn't dawned on her oldest sister that she was falling for a young teenage boy.<p>Kasumi would not allow herself to feel helpless in the situation, and cursed her father for having her even go through with his idiotic request in the first place. Maybe...<p>Kasumi perked up. Maybe Nabiki was the wrong angle to come at. The best thing Kasumi could think of was to separate Ranma and her sister, which would allow the two to cool off from one another...<p>_<p>Nabiki attempted, rather unsuccessfully, to spin the small rubber basketball on her finger. Her latest attempt fumbled from her index finger, bounced against the ground, and slammed against her trashcan. She bent down to pick up the scattered remnants of the recepticle, grumbling over the fact that she could leap two stories, yet couldn't even perform a common basketball trick.<p>She was almost disappointed when her direct line rang, thus disturbing her out of an artistic verbal expression she was quickly becoming proud of. Putting back on her most cheerful and people friendly mask, she answered the call. "Nabiki Tendou... oh, hey, Kasumi. No, my client for today called in a no show, so I'm sitting here with nothing to do. Nodoka Saotome? Sure, I have her number, I've been meaning to call her myself, since I hadn't seen her for a while, why do you want it..."<p>Nabiki's cheerful expression melted, "Very funny, Kasumi... Then why doesn't Tofu call instead, in fact, why are *you* calli- oh, sorry, didn't realize you were still assisting him occasionally. The way you act around him sometimes makes me think you can't stand him or something. Alright, hold on..."<p>Nabiki looked at her desktop scribble pad, and found the number requested jotted in the corner. She read the number to her sister, and was surprised by the quick good bye and disconnect.<p>Nabiki stared at her phone for a few moments, before she kicked her overturned trash can, reminding her that she had a mess she needed to clean up. With the day turning out to be unproductive, Nabiki decided she would rather spend it at home watching a movie, and told her secretary she was leaving early.<p>_<p>"Welcome back, Ranma."<p>"Hey, Nabiki!" Ranma replied, returning from school. He was a little suprised to find Nabiki home at that time, but was glad for her presence nonetheless. He then noticed Shampoo sitting beside the couch, watching him anxiously.<p>Having the Amazon watch him for any period of time tended to make him nervous, "Uh, yo, Shampoo."<p>The young Amazon almost glowered at the acknowledgement. She was hoping Ranma wouldn't notice her, so she could stall for just a little while longer. Unfortunately, her hopes went unanswered, as Ranma's obviously guarded greeting even attracted Nabiki's attention.<p>Swallowing down any feelings that would be becoming of a warrior... or a civilized human being, Shampoo put on her best (although faked) smile, "I was to wonder... Great Grandmother restaurant open now, and she invite you..." Shampoo cast a quick glance to Nabiki, an idea formulating in her head, "...and Nabiki to tonight grand opening. Making too, too special dinner for us all!"<p>"Great! I didn't even have an idea of what we were going to have. This is perfect!" Nabiki quickly chimed in, finding Chinese perfect for her palatte at the moment.<p>Ranma turned a somewhat disappointed glance towards the olderwoman, "I coulda cooked, you know?"<p>Nabiki favored him with a sardonic smile, "No offense, Ranma, but I'm pretty sure Shampoo's Great-Grandmother is a better cook than you."<p>Ranma glared at her, but kept his mouth shut. At the obvious irritation, Nabiki chuckled, attempting to disarm the pigtailed boy's ardor, "Ranma-hon, don't think I wouldn't have appreciated it, but why don't we both relax for dinner tonight? We haven't been out to eat all that much, after all, and it's a treat for us."<p>Ranma deflated, just as Nabiki was hoping he would, "Sure, saves us from having to clean up the dishes, too."<p>Nabiki came to stand next to him, rested her arm against his shoulder, making it humorous in it's attempt, since Ranma was still taller than her, "See? Looking on the bright side, already!"<p>Shampoo looked between them, growing a bit apprehensive; what she was supposed to do tonight just got MUCH harder. The unmistakable communication between them that went quite a ways further than just verbal; the body language as they ensured their postures were mostly turned to one another while being very much in each other's personal space, the visual contact between them that expressed and exchanged mirth and disapproval on sublevels nearly unidentifiable to anyone else observing but the keenest eyes, the physical contact that forced neither to tense, recoil in the slightest, or even observe it in a curious manner. They may not think themselves as close, but their comfort levels with one another were well overlapping.<p>"Shampoo...?"<p>The lavender haired girl shook herself out of her reverie, and smiled nervously; exactly how long had she been staring at them? "Sorry, was thinking of something."<p>Nabiki nodded, though she wasn't really interested in that info, "When are we going to leave?"<p>"Whenever ready."<p>"Lemme go change into something a little more causual, then. Why don't you go clean up a bit too, Ranma?"<p>"If want," Ranma left for the bathroom, just as Nabiki went to her room. After their departure, Shampoo closed her eyes and groaned, hoping that nothing anti-productive came from this dinner date.<p>_<p>Ranma and Nabiki looked up at the sign to the Cat Cafe. It wasn't anything lavish, or anything particularly eye-catching, most likely meaning it would have to succeed on word of mouth alone. Nabiki mused that this would not have escaped Shampoo's Great Grandmother, which spoke volumes of her culinary confidense. Of course, the Tendou woman couldn't argue with that, after sampling several of her dishes on a request for her opinion.<p>It wasn't too much more than a hole in the wall, but the quaint atmousphere held a magnetic presence that drew the curiosity of passer-bys, unlike the multitudes of Chinese restaurants that littered the Tokyo Provinces. "You're Great-Grandmother must be proud of her work.<p>Shampoo nodded, but with no energy, "She happy restaurant now open. Want celebrate."<p>The lack of the Amazon's usual exuberance wasn't lost on Nabiki, who decided that it was best not to comment on the subject. Ranma snorted, more to draw attention to himself than out of any distain or indifference, "Well, if we're gonna eat, I suggest we go *inside* so we can at least place orders?"<p>Shampoo glared at Ranma, but her irritation lost heat, as she realized she was just further stalling. "Is okay, we go inside now."<p>Ranma was the first one to enter, holding the door open for Nabiki, and Shampoo who happened to be trailing behind the woman. Nabiki gave Ranma a grateful smile for his chivalry, while Shampoo merely mumbled her gratitude, as her mind was on another matter. Their presence was noted by a somewhat harried Cologne, and unexpected presence to Shampoo.<p>The young Amazon blinked, and baulked, "Aiyaa... father."<p>The man simply smiled and waved to his daughter, before turning back to preparing orders.<p>"Ah, Nabiki, Ranma," Cologne greeted, after quickly passing her current orders to her grandson, "Welcome! Excuse me if I seem a bit rushed, I had not expected such a turnout."<p>Nabiki nodded, "I have to say that you did your job pretty well, this place is bustling!"<p>"Ah, but I am far from equipped to handle such a crowd... perhaps if one were to volinteer his talents, and make his own funds on side?"<p>"So, where we sitt'n?" Ranma enquired, oblivious to Cologne's hinting.<p>The Amazon Matriarch sighed, and lead the trio to a booth with a 'reserved' card set in the middle of it. "Great Grandmother, why father here?"<p>Both Ranma and Nabiki paused in their seating, to take note of the middle-aged man at the kitchen window, preparing meals with a gusto of the most worldly of chefs.<p>"Shampoo's father, you say?" Nabiki enquired out of intellectual curiosity.<p>"Yes," Cologne answered, speaking to Nabiki first, "He is Shampoo's only living family besides me. His wife and Shampoo's mother was lost in a tragic training accident."<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," Nabiki commented in a quiet voice, looking to Shampoo as she spoke. The Tendou woman knew what it was like to lose her mother at an early age, but could only presume how Shampoo felt about it.<p>Apparently the pain had long dulled over time, as Shampoo merely nodded solumnly at the condolences offered, before speaking to her elder, "Great Grandmother... he no here for reason i think he is here... is he?"<p>Cologne shrugged indifferently to the question, "He arrived here only this morning, but requested his presence to be a surprise."<p>"That is not what I asked, Great Grandmother."<p>Cologne promptly knocked Shampoo on her head with the knob of her staff, "Japanese, girl. As for your inquiry, he is only here to do as is expected of him."<p>"Huh? As is expected of him?" Ranma interjected, "He's the cook or something?"<p>"I thought you would be the one preparing the meals for your restuarant," Nabiki added, feeling a somewhat faint disappointment.<p>Cologne cackled, "Oh, do not worry, young lady. My grandson is perhaps one of the greatest chefs of his generation. It was his chosen art to pursue, and was how he managed to win Shampoo's mother's heart. He is quite the man, as he will also be handling the business aspects, since he also happens to be the more enterprising member of our small family."<p>"Sounds like a charming man," Nabiki commented, earning a nod and a smile from Cologne.<p>"That he is."<p>"Are we gonna get to eat, or what?" Ranma interjected with more than his usual attitude.<p>"My apologies, I do tend to ramble in the presence of familiar company," Cologne replied, though glancing sideways at the pigtailed boy. "Here are your menus, take as much time as you like to find something that appeals to you."<p>"Sure," Ranma replied, gruffly, flipping back and forth through the menu rapidly.<p>"Speaking of 'charming' men..." Cologne quipped, before turning to her Great Granddaughter, "Shampoo, how have you and Ranma been getting along?"<p>Nabiki and Ranma stopped their browsing, one vaguely curious as to where the question came from, while the other apprehensive at suddenly being the topic of discussion.<p>Shampoo gritted her teeth, before putting on a brilliant smile, and, much to Ranma and Nabiki's surprise, suddenly clinging to Ranma's arm, "Get along fine, yes, Ranma?"<p>"I... guess," Ranma replied, subtly attempting to pry the Amazon off of his arm without making a scene.<p>"I thimk we're ready to order now."<p>Shampoo turned to look at Nabiki, who, for the first time that evening, wasn't wearing her usual easy-going expression. Replacing it was possibly the best... what did the westeners in Hong Kong refer to it as... poker face Shampoo had ever seen from other than a matriarch.<p>"Wait! I'm not!" Ranma quickly spoke up, rushing through the menu.<p>Nabiki patted him on the thigh, causing him to go rigid. "I'll go ahead and order for you, Ranma-hon, don't worry about it."<p>Shampoo stared, wide-eyed at Nabiki, and smiled nervously. This was both good and bad, as she now knew Nabiki was rather protective of her territory... and subtly had claimed Ranma within her zone of influence, Shampoo was currently poaching on what was becoming hostile territory.<p>The exchange most assuradly didn't go unnoticed by Cologne, who gave a withering glance to her heir. "Perhaps I may suprise you all," Cologne suggested, taking Nabiki's opportunity away from her, "There are yet a few things that you haven't sampled, but I'm sure you will be pleased by them."<p>"Fine by me, as long as it's not *too* expensive," Nabiki countered, only barely hiding her stolen glances towards Shampoo, who was hugging an increasingly anxious pigtailed boy's arm.<p>Cologne nearly rolled her eyes, "You need not worry, it's on the house. Think of it as a token of gratitude to newly found friends and their support."<p>"Hmm, that's alright, I suppose," Nabiki quipped, before turning to Shampoo, "and quit it, you two. I would expect the both of you to know how to behave in public."<p>"I wasn't doin' anything!" Ranma argued, irked at even being insinuated for any wrong-doing.<p>Cologne chuckled, attempting to disarm Nabiki's reprimanding, "Oh, they're young, allow them their moments."<p>"Those moments aren't welcome all that well in public, I'm afraid," Nabiki countered in a tone that said 'I'm not actually afraid of that fact'.<p>"Oh, but you know how it is to be youthful and infatuated. Surely you can't blame them for-"<p>"Yes, I can," Nabiki interjected, almost glaring at the matriarch, before turning her gaze to Shampoo, "Shampoo, let go of Ranma's arm."<p>Shampoo complied, smiling uneasily at Nabiki, "Sorry."<p>Closing her eyes at her Great Granddaughter's easy submission, Cologne decided to let the matter slide. "I will return shortly with your meal. I guarentee it will not take long."<p>"Yeah, we're starv'n here!" Ranma spoke up, relaxing now that we didn't have an amourous and well endowed girl hugging his arm as if it were a life saver in the middle of the Pacific.<p>Cologne raised an eyebrow at the pigtailed boy, quickly devising a new tactic. "Listen, Sonny-boy, you need to learn to respect your elders! Why, back in my day-"<p>::thimp::<p>Cologne's eyes went wide, as the tip of her staff was being held less than an inch away from Ranma's sternum... by Nabiki's index and thumb. Nabiki was no less surprised than Cologne, or even Ranma and Shampoo for that matter. She wasn't even sure why she intercepted it, it just felt necessary.<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt your anecdote," Nabiki began, gently pushing Cologne's staff away from the table, and away from Ranma, "but I have to admit we've contributed to small talk enough for the time being. And I also need to go to the ladies room for a moment."<p>"Of course," Cologne replied, now with a slight more wariness and admiration for the Tendou woman, "You'll find it around the side, across from the kitchen entrance."<p>Nabiki nodded, ignoring the looks from Ranma and Shampoo, as she made her way to the restroom. Once inside, she let out an audible sigh. Whatever had gotten into her back there, she needed to crush it down right then and there. It wasn't like she had any claim to Ranma, nor wanted it, for that matter. True it wasn't all that becoming to be so overly affectionate around others as Shampoo had been... come to think of it, why had Shampoo suddenly started to throw herself at Ranma? Nabiki would bet steep odds that it had something to do with that 'other' option that Cologne had advised her heir on.<p>Deciding there wasn't much more to consider on the matter for the time being, Nabiki went about her business, before returning to the booth.<p>_<p>"Really, Ranma, I know you were raised in the boonies and all, and by your father, no less, but still..."<p>"How many times am I going to haveta tell you!" Ranma nearly shouted, "I didn't do anything! Blame Shampoo!"<p>"Is right," the Amazon girl in the back seat affirmed quietly, "Ranma do not anything. All my doing."<p>Once again, Nabiki was quiet for several moments, "Well, he should have been more adimant about making the two of you stop."<p>Shampoo and Ranma groaned at the circling argument. "Geez, what's crawled up britches? You've been acting like this since we were at Shampoo's restaurant!"<p>"Don't even try to turn this around on me, Ranma," Nabiki countered, "And don't think I missed your other cute little act back there."<p>"What the hell are you talk'n about, now?"<p>"'Are we gonna eat, or what?'" Nabiki mocked Ranma from earlier, causing the pigtailed boy in the passenger's seat to glare even moreso at the driver. "Honestly, if you any more crass, I'd probably have to lock you away from public."<p>"Oh, and your little 'too expensive' quip of yours wasn't out of line?" Ranma countered, "I mean, you're loaded, and besides, Shampoo already told us it was free!"<p>"I'm not made of money," Nabiki argued, internally berating herself for losing ground in her and Ranma's 'discussion'.<p>"Yeah, well sometimes you act like it!"<p>"Keep talking like that, Mr. Saotome, and you'll find that the money tree you've seemed to have mistaken me for run dry."<p>Ranma turned away from Nabiki, mumbling under his breath, "Better than you acting like a cold hearted..."<p>"EXCUSE ME?" Nabiki shouted.<p>"LOOK OUT!"<p>Nabiki glanced back forward at Shampoo's warning, and easily swerved from behind the car that had suddenly slowed down in front of her. Without missing a beat, she turned her attention back to Ranma, "What the Hell do you mean by that?"<p>Ranma was a bit unnerved that she heard him, but still remained defiant, "Whaddya think I mean? You're acting like a jerk out of the blue. You're blaming me for crap I had no control over when you should be tick off at your 'best friend' back there!"<p>"Ah, dinner too, too delicious, yes?" Shampoo piped up in a nervous voice, hoping to change the topic. Yes, it was a futile endeavor, but she would rather them continue when Nabiki was NOT driving a large automation filled with combustable fluid at expedient velocities.<p>Much to Shampoo's dismay and elation, she was ignored. "I see your driving's improved..."<p>Nabiki quickly swallowed down the string of swearwords that she was ready to level at the passenger next to her. "Leave her out of this, Ranma," Nabiki retorted, "I do not appreciate being called that! Least of all by a smart-mouthed hormonal little brat like you!"<p>"Then what should I call you?" Ranma quipped back, "Old maid? Na, an old maid wouldn't be throw'n around her cash like she ain't got anything better to do with it! How about Mom-... uh... Nabiki?"<p>The woman didn't reply, keeping her view straight, even if she was having trouble seeing the road. Both of her hands remained in a white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel, attempting to appear as if she were simply driving causually.<p>"Damn you, Ranma," Nabiki whispered, too silent for anyone to hear what she had said, including herself. Ranma stared at Nabiki, wondering where her heat for the argument suddenly disappeared, and found his own extinguished for the lack of it. Somberly, he turned back to look at the road ahead of them, not even bothering to fight the hint of guilt knawing at his concience. Shampoo looked between the two with a trepid expression, fearful of the harm her little act for her Great-Grandmother had caused.<p>Other than the quiet hum of the BMW's engine, no other sound was made for the rest of the drive home.<p>_<p>Cologne and her Grandson had managed to clean up the restaurant quickly for the night, allowing her time to relax with her pipe. "That Nabiki woman, she is certainly a surprise," Cologne mused to herself.<p>"Are you referring to the woman that has been sponsering my daughter during her stay here in Japan?"<p>Cologne nodded, not turning to face her Grandson, "Yes, and quite an attractive lady she is, wouldn't you say?" Cologne imagined the man nodded.<p>"I thank you for the opportunity to practice my craft abroad, Grandmother... but I have a suspicion that you asked for me presense for another matter entirely?"<p>Cologne chuckled, before taking a short puff from her pipe, "Typical male, must you be so suspicious of your own flesh and blood?"<p>"Would you have me be any other way, Grandmother?"<p>"HAH! I see the warrior's cunning hadn't abandoned you, Xian Ku Shui " Cologne chortled, "If I have a specific plan for you, you'll find out about it eventually."<p>"Which would then be too late," Xian Pu's father enquired in a wry tone.<p>"That is what would make it all the more fun!" Ku Shui chuckled, before heading to his room for the rest of the night, carrying several cookbooks he had picked up upon his arrival.<p>Cologne returned to her private thoughts after her Grandson's departure. She sincerely doubted Nabiki had any knowledge of the pressure point the Amazon Matriarch was going for, yet she even acted fast enough to counter it. Cologne was positive she disguised her aura of intent from being sensed by feigning indignation, so even intuitively, Nabiki should not have realized any capacity for harm coming to Ranma.<p>Also, Nabiki hadn't acted all that offensively towards Shampoo as she brazenly hung onto him, like she didn't consider the girl all that much a threat. Cologne had to smirk at that thought; that little play her heir put on for her was certainly amusing, but far from convincing, so it shouldn't be surprising if Nabiki also saw through it. Then again, she was still sincere in her objections.<p>Cologne sighed. Shampoo's stalling obviously allowed the woman and boy to get closer, and from the points the wizened woman had just observed, they may be much closer than it would allow for her comfort.<p>_<p>Nabiki was the first one in the door, and quickly turned around to remove her shoes. Shampoo then entered, followed by Ranma; both of them watching their host with concern.<p>"My, the three of you have been gone for a while. I was afraid I would have to return tomorrow."<p>"AAAAAHHH!" Both Shampoo and Ranma started, looking up to find the Saotome Matriarch standing before them to greet their entry. Nabiki also had jolted, and turned to look at the other woman. Nodoka's chiding smile fell, at the sight of Nabiki's reddened eyes, before they turned away.<p>Nodoka was about to speak, but Nabiki quickly strode past her, headed into her den, closed, then locked the door. Words meant for one person were discarded, replaced by words meant for her son, "Is Nabiki okay?"<p>"I... I honestly don't know, Mom," Ranma replied, walking past the woman.<p>Shampoo favored the red-headed woman with a weak smile, "Ah... alarm was set, Shampoo sure..."<p>Nodoka shrugged, "Well, I *am* the wife of a martial artist." Read: "I'm the wife of Genma Saotome, a man with more than a few tricks about breaking and entering."<p>"How goes with Nabiki and Ranma?"<p>Shampoo's expression grew morose, "Explain in kitchen... is not good right now..."<p>_<p>Nabiki sat at her desk with her eyes closed. This time, Ranma struck more cords with her than the string section in a symphony. True, he was only following his usual pattern of argument, taking any ground given, and making the most of it, but what she couldn't ignore was the underlying truth.<p>She had been flaunting her money. She was used to spending exorbantly on herself, but only with a few treats here or there. On the other hand, she had been treating him out to dinner more often than she could recall, she paid for many necessities for the pigtailed boy, she was even giving him money without even having his request, just so he would have a little spending money. She was indeed throwing around her money...<p>...all for him.<p>What made this different from a past mistake, the biggest mistake of her life? Well, this time, she wasn't dating Ranma, and Ranma seemed impassive towards it for the most part. That still didn't help the fact that the parallels drawn during dinner alone were enough to open wounds as if they were freshly created.<p>Once again, she owed Ranma an apology. If not for her nearly choking sobs, she would have laughed at how often she had to do it. As brash and irritating as Ranma could be, she always blew up in his face with equal, if not even more overpowering, fervor.<p>She remembered Jesse trying to console her a while back, telling her that it was far from her fault. If that was true, why was it happening all over again?<p>The door muffled her whimpering cries from the outside world, as the low hum of her computer and ceiling fan attempted to drown out the sound of her sorrow completely.<p>_<p>Ranma rolled over, and looked out his window. The midnight hue beyond still dominated the sky, easily explaining to the pigtailed boy that it was still early. There was no more fight in him, so he rose from the bed, deciding that attempting an hour or so more sleep was a pointless endeavor.<p>Nabiki had stayed in the den since he had gone to bed the following night, leaving him unable to at least guage how upset she was visually. Of course, it wasn't necessary. The martial artist woodenly gathered himself, and headed downstairs. He passed Shampoo's quarters, able to hear her soft but barely audible snores. He envied her; being able to rest as if she had no problems to contend with, no hurts inflicted on another to hammer her concience, and make slumber a wasted task. He had no idea what game she was playing last night, and he fully intended to make it known how much he appreciated it to her. She was going to suffer just as much as he did for this, it was only fair.<p>Disregarding thoughts of vengence for the time being, his turmoiled rest left him with little energy. The early dawn would provide for a soothing and peaceful workout. It would also allow him to sort out a few issues. Nabiki started it with the blame game, so why was *he* feeling so guilty over it? Actually, he knew why. After repetition, one does begin to learn, from martial arts, to social ettiquite, to affairs of trust and friendship.<p>He wanted to say it was just like the other times, but he wouldn't blatantly lie to himself. He had always recalled an anger from the woman when they had clashed; anger ranging from outright hostility to blatant indifference. Whatever the end of the spectrum, it was always in his direction. Even if he tried to ignore it, he could feel the presense of Nabiki's animosity upon him, almost forcing him to face the situation, instead of ignoring it, as he always attempted to do with many of his problems.<p>This time, there was anger, a hostility bordering on loathing. The true difference, it was directed towards herself, leaving Ranma on the outside.<p>That... was the issue. It wasn't actually the guilt that was tearing at him, it was his concern. Two easily mistakable, so alike emotions. He understood he was Nabiki's friend, and becoming a very close one, as far as he could tell. As he lightly pondered it, Ranma realized that he very much liked the idea of Nabiki's friendship. Before it was something he took for granted rather effortlessly, even when it was tested. He knew well enough and intuitively that he didn't want her to stay mad at him forever, so his apologies were always sincere, just as hers were.<p>That was an aspect of their friendship he overlooked. Never did they intentionally want to stay mad at each other. For every effort mad to burn bridges between them, twice the effort was put forth than was necessary to rebuild them.<p>The bridges were not reduced to ash, this time they were barracaded. Ranma wanted in, but was unsure of what the key to enter was. Nabiki wasn't allowing him to be privvy to her current anguish last night, the pigtailed martial artist hoped that she wouldn't keep it to herself indefinitely.<p>Before he realized it, he had entered the kitchen, heading for the back door.<p>"You're up early."<p>Ranma froze at Nabiki's voice, and turned to find her sitting at the dining table, her hands wrapped around a full cup of coffee. From the lack of steam rising from it, the pigtailed boy could presume she had made it a good time ago.<p>"So are you," Ranma pointed out.<p>"Couldn't sleep," Nabiki answered, staring into her cooled coffee as if it was what she was holding a conversation with. After a few moments, she spoke again, "You?"<p>"Ah, wanted to get some early practice," Ranma replied, a bit shakenly.<p>Nabiki had not heard Ranma's alarm go off, so his early rising was obviously not intentional. She could only guess that she was the cause for his early awakening, possibly the same reason she was unable to get to sleep. Damn it, why was she doing this to him? Why was she giving him problems that no boy his age should have to deal with, especially from herself.<p>Finding no continuing reply, and far from experienced on how to breach the subject in the delicate manner it demanded, Ranma started to open the back door again. "I'm sorry."<p>"Huh?" Ranma paused, turning back to Nabiki, not quite registering the apology.<p>Nabiki offered him a weak, sad smile, "Maybe... maybe you should take Cologne up on her offer... to work for her and make your own money."<p>"What's this got to do with anything?"<p>"Ranma... I... I didn't mean to upset you... like that. I wasn't thinking straight,and-"<p>"Stop."<p>"-and... Ranma?" Nabiki had just barely caught his whispered demand.<p>"Stop apologising, alright?" Ranma almost growled, still facing the door, "Quit acting like it's all your fault!"<p>"But... I..."<p>"No." Ranma turned to Nabiki with a firm expression, "I ain't gonna let you just blame yourself, like you're the one abusing our friendship."<p>"I... I don't understand," Nabiki softly replied, confused as to what was going on.<p>"I'm just as responsible as you are for what happens between us, so don't patronize me by acting as if you caused everything."<p>"But Ranma, I'm supposed to be the adult one here-"<p>"Damn it, Nabiki!" Ranma nearly shouted, "I'm getting tired of you treating me like some little kid, and I don't care who's supposed to be acting like adults!" Ranma approached the table, and put the palms of his hands flat against it. "I don't know what's got you so twisted up, but I can see that it goes beyond whatever happened last night!"<p>At Ranma declaration, Nabiki's eyes went wide. She hadn't expected him to actually be that perceptive, "I don't know what you're talking about..."<p>"What's the apology really for? Just trying to keep me from worrying about the old woman acting miserable?" Ranma's concern began to show on his face, "Nabiki, I can't ignore this if you're going to be this way. You're the one that is always reminding me that we're friends, aren't friends supposed to talk about stuff like this?"<p>Nabiki stared, speechless. She hadn't even noticed it until just now, but Ranma apparently grew up some. Ranma continued to wait for her answer, before giving off a fustrated growl. He walked away from the table, and headed to the sink. Nabiki watched Ranma, as she wrung her wet pigtail out, walked back to the table, and sat next to Nabiki. "Maybe this is some girl thing that you just can't tell a guy... so you gonna talk now?"<p>"Ranma, why can't you understand that there's just nothing to talk about?"<p>"I can't because it ain't true," Ranma replied, surprising Nabiki by brushing the woman's bangs from the front of her face. "This have something to do with the old ghoul's job offer, too?"<p>It was an angle that Nabiki quickly identified, and began to utilize, "Sorry, Ranma, I hadn't realized that I was making you so uncomfortable by playing the rich playgirl in front of you. I didn't think much about it."<p>"Ah... well I guess I did go too far about that," Ranma replied, scratching the back of her head, "It's your business what you do with what you make, you don't need me to tell you what to do with it." Ranma entwined her own fingers together, looking away from Nabiki. "Look, I've never been around people with much money, and I can't say I've had much use for a lot of it, myself. I know a lot of it is just going to tak'n care of me, and I appreciate that... but I don't want to just take from someone I care about, like you don't matter past your pocket book."<p>Ranma paused, looking back to Nabiki, and finding the woman's gaze cast back down into her coffee, "I don't need a lot of stuff from you, I'm just glad to have you, Nabiki." At the long silence that ensued, Ranma blinked, "Uh... Nabiki?" The blank stare complimented by the gaping mouth that Ranma was recieving from the woman sent her own concern into overdrive, "Something wrong?"<p>Slowly, Nabiki closed her mouth, but continued to stare. The slight flutter she had felt in her chest had robbed her of breath, as she failed to think any further. Eventually, the need to flee overwhelmed her, as she quickly stood up from the table, and rushed back to her room.<p>Ranma stared after her, taking several seconds to register what had just happened. "Nabiki? NABIKI!" Recieving no answer, the pigtailed girl began to feel an overwhelming urge to break something, vent her anger over her confusion somehow.<p>The door slamming to Nabiki's private abode sounded to Ranma as if the obstacle between her and Nabiki had just fortified. Unable to take the sense of rejection, Ranma finally opened the back door, ignoring the alarm, and ran out into the slowly lightening morning.<p>_<p>Nabiki slumped against her door, wrapping her arms tightly around herself. She looked up to the dark ceiling of her room, as if it would present the answer to the question that was blaring in her mind.<p>Why, why did Ranma have to say that? Of all the things that could have been said, why did Ranma have to say one of the most amazing things Nabiki could ever possibly be told?<p>With her head inclined, she could feel the moisture trailing down her cheeks, as realization sunk in. A simple, yet profound fact that she could not ignore. Because of this fact, things could not go back to the way they had been before.<p>"Why?" Her single worded question was far more complex in it's simplicity than could ever truly be answered.<p>_<p>Shampoo swore in Mandarin, irritated at being woken up by the blaring house alarm. She quickly made her way to the alarm panel by the front door, and promptly turned it off.<p>Finding the light on in the kitchen, the Amazon walked in, and looked around for anyone present. The only signs that anyone had been around was the completely full cup of cold coffee on the table. That in itself was suspect, as Shampoo knew how valued Nabiki found the stuff.<p>Shampoo's second stop was to Nabiki's door, finding it closed, yet able to literally hear the emotion from the other side. Her own alarm was now blaring far greater than the one built into the house, as she quickly but stealthily headed upstairs, and to Ranma's room.<p>Finding him missing, Shampoo could only presume that things may have come to a head... but most likely not in the way that had been hoped.
