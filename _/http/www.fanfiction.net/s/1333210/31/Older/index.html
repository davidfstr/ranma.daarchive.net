</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki remained next to Ranma on her bed, her arm draped lazily over his side, as she unconciously drew in his scent. They had stayed up rather late, last night, and she figured he deserved the rest. She also didn't want to get up since she was very comfortable against him.<p>She brought her arm down to wrap around his stomach as he continued to sleep, and recalled what they had done the previous night... nothing, nothing but talk. Even so, it had been just as cherishable as any session of lovemaking they had shared. Last night, all she did was listen to his problems, and give him comfort as much as she could; sharing in his hurt feelings as if they were her own. Nabiki vowed she would have a long chat with Ukyo. She had warned the chef not to hurt Ranma over what was obviously her own problem that should be taken up between Genma and her father, and Nabiki was gravely serious about the implied consequences.<p>Ranma would probably be out of it for a while longer, probably more emotionally drained than he was ever used to. He would feel a lot more refreshed when he woke up, but he was still pretty worn out. Patting his side gently, Nabiki rolled out of bed, preparing to remove her pajamas, just as her cellphone rang. She quickly answered it, lest it disturb Ranma, "Hel- Thomas?" Nabiki switched to English "{and what do I owe the pleasure of this call to?}"<p>"[{Akane's coming. She's been speaking with Kasumi}]"<p>"WHAT?" Nabiki shouted, unconciously switching back to Japanese, and startling Ranma out of his slumber. The pigtailed boy rolled over,blearily trying to observe what the commotion was all about.<p>"[{Akane's pretty mad, too,}]" Thomas added, sounding more than a little concerned, "[{I tried to call you earlier, but you didn't answer}]"<p>Nabiki cursed herself, for having set the voicemail to activate during certain times as to not disturb her. Thomas also alerted her to exactly how serious it was. He customarily understated his wife's mood; what normal people would call 'homicidal', he would call 'irritable'. He just said Akane was 'mad'. That would much be like saying Mt. St. Helens was a puff. "{When did she leave?}"<p>"[{This morning, so-}]"<p>"{Great, I'll talk to you later!}" Nabiki interjected, before quickly hanging up.<p>"Sup' Nabiki?" Ranma asked, finally sitting up.<p>"No time to speak, gotta pack," Nabiki responded, briskly striding to her closet, and pulling out a suitcase.<p>Ranma blinked, "Wha?"<p>"Hurry up! We don't want to be late for whatever flight is leaving the country." Nabiki said in a factual, chiding tone, as she walked over to her dresser, and started throwing underwear haphazardly into the suitcase.<p>"You realize it's too early for this, right?" Ranma commented, before groaning, and pulling himself out of bed.<p>"Hey, ever been to America before? I think we should go there," Nabiki replied, participating in a completely different conversation.<p>"Nabiki, what's this all about?" Ranma enquired, getting the sneaking suspicion that his girlfriend and fiancee had gone off the deep end.<p>"oh, it's nothing," Nabiki replied, "Homicidal sister on the way, felt like it would be a great time for a vacation." The middle aged woman smiled at her lover sweetly, as she forced her suitcase closed. She then realized she packed most everything in the dresser, and forgot to pack practical clothing. She shrugged it off, deciding she could buy more clothes... wherever.<p>"What, Kasumi?" Ranma equired with a raised eyebrow. Sure, the woman was cynical, and easily irritable, but he didn't see her as the murdering type.<p>"Na, if Kasumi wanted you dead, you would be dead by now," Nabiki replied, casually. She hefted her suitcase, and walked towards the door, "Come on, I'll help you pack. You don't need much, right?"<p>"Nabiki, we're not going to America," Ranma sighed, before yawning.<p>"Then how about the Carribean?" Nabiki suggested, sauntering over to Ranma best she could with a heavy pack, "I've always wanted to go there; great climate, vibrant culture, sandy beaches..."<p>"We have sandy beaches here, in Japan," Ranma countered in a dry tone.<p>"But they're not Carribean beaches!" Nabiki responded in a cute pout, before her eyes widened, "Oh! I need to go book the tickets!"<p>Ranma closed his eyes, and breathed deeply, wishing he had pretended to be asleep longer. With a groan of fustration, he tracked his fiancee to her home office, and found her sitting in front of her computer, "Nabiki..."<p>"Good news, I found six flights departing within the next two hours; Italy, Hong Kong, America, Australia, Taiwan, and Azores. If it's the same to you, I've already been to Italy, Hong Kong, and Australia."<p>"How about you start explaining things from the beginning?" Ranma suggested, folding his arms.<p>Nabiki sighed, and relented, "My Brother-in-law called, Akane's on her way. She's been talking with Kasumi, and she's angry. That's not good news, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed young man shrugged his shoulders, "So? You didn't freak out when we told Kasumi, why now?"<p>"Because Kasumi may be obnoxious and pesemistic, but Akane's... well... AKANE!" Nabiki explained, clearly and logically. "Hmm, you know? We better write off America, too. Just our luck we end up at the same layover point as her. That would be bad."<p>"Nabiki," Ranma walked over to his future wife, and draped his arms loosely around her neck from behind, "So would running away." He idly wondered when he became so affectionate; sure he was before, but since last night...<p>Nabiki calmed down a bit, "Ranma, it's for the best that we're not here when she is. my sister is not rational when she's angry."<p>"I don't think Akiko-"<p>"Akane..."<p>"Right, Akane," Ranma sheepishly corrected himself; it would be rather embarrassing to mangle the names of his future in-laws like that, "She can't be all that bad. We'll just have to explain to her that we're getting married, and she'll probably just accept that she can't do anything about it," Ranma stated soothingly.<p>Nabiki remained still, with her eyes closed, relishing Ranma's ebrace, and letting his words sink in. She then sat up, "There, done! Two tickets to the Azores."<p>"Huh?" Ranma looked up at the computer screen, unable to make heads or tails of the website.<p>Nabiki got out of her deskchair, picking up her hastefully packed luggage. "We need to hurry if we want to make that flight on time."<p>"Uh, you can cancel those tickets, right?" Ranma enquired.<p>Nabiki blinked, and looked back at him, "Why in the world would I want to do that?"<p>"We can't just take off like this," Ranma stated, "What about your job?"<p>Nabiki scoffed, "Like they really need me there. Charles can do all my work for me, he probably deserves it anyhow."<p>"What about school? I've already missed enough days," Ranma countered. Alright, he didn't *really* care, but it made for a good argument.<p>Nabiki paused on that, "We'll call your mother and have them set up correspondance, we can lay low until this whole thing blows over."<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, "Okay, Shampoo and Happosai? Where are they going to stay while we're gone?"<p>"They both have keys," Nabiki retorted, "Really, hon, we're jus stalling here."<p>"Alright, what about-"<p>Nabiki nearly screamed out in fustration, before thinking of something. "I'll tell you what..." Nabiki rushed back to her room, leaving Ranma standing there, blinking in confusion. She dropped down by the side of her bed, and retrieved a box hidden under it. She then skipped back to Ranma, and opened the box, "We go, you get to see me in this."<p>Ranma looked at the contents of the box, "Uh, what is it?"<p>With a playful smirk, Nabiki pulled the item from the box, and held it against her body. Ranma continued to blink in confusion, "A leather fishing net?"<p>Nabiki nearly wept, "Look, we don't have time to argue this, let's go get your stuff."<p>"Nabiki, when we were talking last night, about other things like what happened between me and... Ukyo... happening again. You said no matter what, you would be there for me, and we would get through it together, right?"<p>Nabiki nodded, sobering up a bit more at the reminder of Ranma's mood the previous night. "Yeah, I did."<p>"Well, I don't see how this is different," Ranma replied, "We'll still have to face your sister some time, if we're getting m-married... I don't know much of how she's gonna react to the news, but I'm gonna be there with you, too. We can get through this together, alright?"<p>Nabiki deflated, and nodded her head, "You're right, Ranma. We can do this... together." Ranma began to smile. "Now hurry up and go get your damn stuff, so we can leave *together*!"<p>Ranma fell flat on his face, as Nabiki removed the support of her shoulders from him. "I... think you missed the point," Ranma replied, dryly.<p>"I'll go start the car, just be ready in a minute, I know you're fast enough to do that," Nabiki stated, heading for the door, totally having forgotten that she was still wearing her pajammas, while carrying her luggage in her right hand.<p>"I'm trying to be the mature one here," Ranma stated, realizing he was fighting a losing battle.<p>"Well quit trying, it's wasting time." Nabiki set her luggage down to open the door, "Quckly, your minute is almost up!" She opened the door, and bent down to pick up her luggage."<p>"Going somewhere, Sis?"<p>"EEEYYYYYAAAAAA!" Nabiki screamed as she found her youngest sister, looking back at her with a stone expression, while her finger was poised to ring the doorbell.<p>"Jittery from all that coffee you drink, I see," Akane replied in an unamused tone.<p>"You CAN'T be here yet! Thomas told me you left this morning!" Nabiki nearly screamed, dropping her suitcase, and pointing at Akane with her other hand. They both blinked, before looking at the bundle of leather straps in Nabiki's upriased fist. With a sickly smile, Nabiki quickly brought her hand to hide it behind herself.<p>"I did, this morning... in California," Akane stated, shifting her own luggage against her shoulder, "Are you going to let your younger sister in?"<p>"W-well sis... nice of you to drop by on your way to the training hall... if you hurry you can catch Kasumi" Nabiki quickly recovered... more or less.<p>"Actually, I think I have time to chat with you for a bit."<p>"N-no you don't, I was just about to leave, see my luggage?" Nabiki insisted.<p>Akane looked at the suitcase, and then to Nabiki, "Did you plan on going out in your pajammas?"<p>Nabiki's sickly smile distorted more, "Y-yes."<p>"You know? The last time I seen you this nervous was when you found out that investment you convinced me to chip in went down south," Akane stated, very seriously, "You still owe me 150,000 yen for that, by the way."<p>Nabiki's expression went stone cold, "Akane, we're both aware that I reimbursed you on that in full."<p>"You did, and now that you're not acting like a jibbering idiot, we can talk about something that Kasumi told me over the phone," Akane countered.<p>Nabiki's manic smile was back, "No we can't." Akane's eyes narrowed, but before she could speak...<p>"Alright, got everything I needed, what were you screaming about?" As he came into the main entrance hall, he spotted the shorter woman that he had only seen for a brief period of time, Nabiki's sister Akane, "Oh, hey."<p>Akane bowed slightly, before smiling at Ranma, "Hey yourself, doing okay?"<p>Ranma scratched the back of his head, "Heh, I'm doing alright these days." Ranma knew the woman's facade of politeness was shallow as a drained ditch. The thin aura of intensity about her that made him want to raise his heckles was one possible hint.<p>Akane nodded, before glaring at her sister, "Why is he still here?"<p>"Oh, he was just about to leave, see his luggage?" Nabiki replied, sweetly, pointing to the pack Ranma was carrying.<p>"With you?" Akane asked.<p>"No/Yes," Nabiki/Ranma answered.<p>"Nabiki," Akane subtly growled, causing her sister to 'eep'.<p>"Alright, Alright," Nabiki placated, forcing herself to calm down, "Truth is, I haven't been able to locate our fathers. They've been hiding pretty well."<p>"You're slipping," Akane taunted, "You used to be able to find anyone on the planet within two weeks."<p>Nabiki's expression twitched, knowing most assuradly her sister was baiting her, "Let's just say Dad and Genma have been rather resourceful."<p>Akane pursed her lips, before turning to look to Ranma, "Do you have any other relatives? Not that my sister appreciates the company..." Akane looked at Nabiki with a scrutenizing gaze, in which Nabiki held firm against. Disappointed at no reaction, Akane continued, "I'm pretty sure they would like to know you're alive and well, at least."<p>Nabiki's eyes widened, before she turned to Ranma, furiously mouthing 'no'.<p>Ranma didn't seem to catch what she was insisting on, "Well, my Mom stops by occationally. She insists that I stay with Nabiki so-"<p>"-she can make better accomidations for him. She lives in a small apartment," Nabiki interjected, glaring at Ranma hard enough to force him to shut up.<p>Her little sister didn't miss the look, "I'm sure he could have explained that himself, if it's true."<p>Akane may be blunt, and more hands on, but Nabiki knew her sister didn't lack for subtly when she wanted it. The prod was slight, just barely an accusation of her honesty. Enough to let Nabiki know Akane was far more than suspect.<p>"I'm sure you're tired after your long flight. Let me call you a cab, and I'll foot the hotel cost for you. Least I can do for my dear sister," Nabiki replied, almost coldly, showing Akane she didn't appreciate the insinuation. Ranma raised his eyebrows, not having heard that tone from his girlfriend in a while.<p>Akane seemed quelled somewhat by her sister's irritation, but far from faltering, "What's wrong with allowing me to stay here? You do have two guest rooms..."<p>"Well, with Ranma and Happosai occupying-"<p>"Happosai's here?" Akane interjected in a bland tone, "He should still be gone for two more years."<p>"He's persona non-grata in ANY country," Nabiki replied with dry humor, knowing that Akane would sooner slit her throat than stay in the same house as the ancient pervert, "and since he IS a Japanese native, this is one country he can't be deported from."<p>Akane narrowed her eyes, and then turned to look at Ranma again, before looking back at her sister, "Don't worry about it, I can afford my own stay..." In a louder voice, before turning away, she announced, "I wouldn't want to put you out, sis."<p>Nabiki folded her arms, unheading of the naughty leather garment still in her hand, as she stared at Akane's back. Akane turned around to look over her shoulder, "We'll talk later about things... and put that away before the little creep gets any perverted ideas." With that, Akane walked to the sidewalk, before leaping to the rooftops.<p>Once she couldn't feel her sister's presence, even if she knew Akane could hide it well enough for her not to notice it in a good scour, Nabiki slumped as if she were exhausted. "Whaddshe call me that for?" Ranma asked, put off on the 'creep' comment.<p>Nabiki turned to Ranma, and sighed, before closing the door. "Go ahead and put your stuff away, we won't be going anywhere."<p>"You really that freaked out about your sister?" Ranma asked in a concerned tone, setting his pack down and walking over to Nabiki.<p>The middle aged woman nodded, heading for the kitchen to fix herself a cup of coffee, "Akane actually dropped everything to come see what was going on, Ranma. She's pretty serious about this."<p>"So, we're going to go back to being quiet about... us?" Ranma asked, finding the idea very distasteful now. Her mother accepted their relationship, even gave her blessings. The honor of their schools rode on this. He himself couldn't think of ever holding back his feelings from the woman he loved no longer. Just thinking about having to go back to that routine not only angered him, but hurt him as well.<p>Nabiki sadly nodded again, "If just until I can convince her to leave things be. Akane won't be rational against something she's dead set against, and I'm pretty sure Kasumi has Akane thinking her way."<p>"So, just convince Kasumi to get your sister to lay off," Ranma suggested, sitting at the dining table.<p>"If it were that easy, I would be on the phone right now," Nabiki replied, pouring the coffeeground into the filter, "If there is even a sliver of chance that Kasumi can find in 'saving' me, she'll take it. Kasumi only accepted that I wouldn't let her change anything, that she couldn't do anything about it. Akane's a more hands on person."<p>"What? She'll beat the crap out of me or something?" Ranma enquired, trying to invoke some levity.<p>"Within an inch of your life, presuming she even feels inclined to stop," Nabiki stated, firmly.<p>Ranma blinked, but was pretty sure Nabiki was joking... mostly. "Come on, your sister knows you can take care of yourself, just explain things to her."<p>Nabiki sat down at the table next to Ranma, looking down at her hands, "Ranma, Akane's pretty protective of me. I guess it's sweet that she is, but she doesn't quite know where to leave things be. And, truthfully, she's been validated before."<p>"By 'him', right?" Ranma enquired, pretty sure who she was referring to. He still had yet to ever hear the full story about him, nor did he care to, but it seemed like the guy's presence seemed to remain as the crux of things. Nabiki's apprehension, the trials of earning one another's trust and affection, and now the battle for everyone's approval. A ghost from the past still provided the obstacles, and without ever having met him, Ranma would curse him for all his days.<p>"Akane left him pretty messed up when she was done with him. Saito wasn't a martial artist, but he wasn't exactly someone to be taken lightly in the physical sense," Nabiki stated, before looking up at Ranma, directly into his eyes. "I know you're capable of handling yourself, but I would rather not let things come to that. She's my sister, Ranma, and you're my fiance, I already know whose side I'll be on..." Nabiki reached over and grasped Ranma's hand, "but I don't want to have to make that choice at all."<p>Grasping her hand back, Ranma nodded, "Alright... if it means that much to you."<p>Nabiki smiled, "Thanks, Ranma, it really does."<p>_<p>"Cool! We're gett'n outta school!"<p>"Only for a few days, and you're going to make up all your homework," Thomas stated solumnly. True he was much more lenient on his sons than his wife was, but that didn't mean he couldn't assert his own authority.<p>"Why?" Bruce asked, innocently, "We can do it when we get back."<p>"Because your mother's already ticked off as it is," Thomas replied, his voice wavering a bit, "Remember the kitchen incident?"<p>Both Bruce and Steven baulked, "Bu-but that wasn't our fault!"<p>"Just go get ready you two. We need to hurry up so we can stop your mother from committing manslaughter." Thomas urged. Sometimes, he thought his wife forgot she was no longer a Japanese citizen, and foreign homicide is usually taken much more drastically.<p>After his sons went to quickly pack, his usually carefree expression melted from his face. He loved his wife, almost as much as they both loved their children, but he just couldn't condone her interferance. He had grown up with the philosophy that everyone had to learn from trial and error, that everyone had to understand their own mistakes without someone rushing in to 'save them'. Of course, with the sadistic relatives he had (when they weren't simply being dull), he couldn't help but adhere to that mindset.<p>He loved Akane for her passion, that notion of justice she held, those moments when she was vunerable in her insecurity, and her determination. Unfortunately, every one of those aspects were working against him, as he saught to chase after her, and prevent her from alienating herself from her sister, and possibly the rest of her family. The distance between them made things estranged as it was, her temper didn't needbe what severed her ties.<p>With a prayer to his ancestors, he hoped that Nabiki could hold Akane off until he got there.<p>_<p>Akane turned off the exit for the Nerima district in the rented Audi TT roadster. She didn't really need a car; public transportation was fine, and the traffic in Tokyo was a serious pain in the ass to navigate, even in the more rural areas. Often, Akane wondered why Nabiki bothered, but in the end decided it was more for the status than anything. Even with a car, she would have a two block hike to her family home from where she parked.<p>Sometimes, the notion of spoiling yourself was highly overrated.<p>Akane pulled out the disposable cellphone she picked up for her stay, and dialed a vaguely familiar number. She waited a few moments, before the other end picked up.<p>"[Hello?]"<p>"Kasumi, I'm in town, sorry about the short notice," Akane replied, being careful to keep her attention on the road; Nabiki had enough incidents for all three sisters.<p>Akane could almost see Kasumi fluster, "[Y-you're here?]"<p>"Yup, I'll be home in about twenty minutes," Akane stated, "Just turned into Nerima a minute ago."<p>"[Whu-... but I'm not prepared for you, I have to get a room ready for you and...]"<p>Akane almost chuckled. Even after life turned her eldest sister into the sweet, yet jaded person she was, every so often a peek of the exuberant, dutiful homemaker would make itself known. "That's okay, Kasumi, you don't have to go through all that work for me." Akane took a deep breath, before continuing, as she made a left, "Kasumi, you're going to explain to me what's going on between Nabiki and that kid. I already figured how deep she's involved with him, and if she thinks he makes her happy, then more power to her..."<p>"[If you don't care, then why are you here?]" Kasumi enquired, he phone managing to relay her tone of sight betrayal and irritance.<p>"I still don't agree with it, even if this is about Dad's rediculous, archaic notions of honor," Akane stated, firmly, "What this is about, is Nabiki going through the same shit she did years ago, and leaving us to pick up every damn broken piece of her. We both know nothing's going to come out of this relationship. I don't *care* if she believe the little creep is *the* one for her, she doesn' need this crap, period."<p>"[What happened to 'more power to her'?]? Kasumi mocked, now with a hint of humor.<p>Akane nearly closed her eyes in exasperation, if it weren't for the fact she was driving, "It's not about how happy she *thinks* she is, it's about how happy she's been before all this nonsense. I don't know where she got the idea that that kid will complete her or whatever, probably reading too many of those damn romance novels you keep lending her."<p>"[Nabiki's taken to buying her own, thank you,]" Kasumi replied, sharply.<p>"Whatever," Akane replied, "I'm almost to the public parking garage, I'll talk to you when I get in."<p>_<p>Ranma prepared lunch for the both of them. It wasn't anything fantasic, just some pre-packaged udon noodles with shrimp broth and spring onions. He wasn't really in the mood to make things remotely elaborate, even if Nabiki would greatly appreciate his efforts; it was just the discussion they had put him on end.<p>He agreed to it, but he was far from happy with what she wanted. Screw prudence, Ranma Saotome was ready to let the world know about the woman he loved, and the deities help whoever came between them. He didn't want to fight Nabiki's sister, but quite frankly, he decided she was getting on his nerves.<p>Nabiki walked into the kitchen, wearing a t-shirt and housejeans. She obviously didn't intend to leave the house this Sunday, which both relieved the pigtailed boy, and made him tense at the same time. He was glad for her company, getting as much of it as possible, but at some point while they were together, he would have to bring up one glaring point Nabiki seemed to have missed.<p>That time, he decided, may as well be now, "You know? Your sister's going to get the whole story from Kasumi."<p>Nabiki wanted to favor Ranma with a droll expression, but she knew that wouldn't help matters. Ranma was seething right now, "Ranma, she already figured out what's up between us. She's not stupid."<p>"Then what's with the crap about us being careful around her?" Ranma snapped, now angry over the fact that they're apparently doing it for nothing.<p>"Because, even if she does know, she's not going to do anything about it until she's provoked," Nabiki explained, "Akane's not the most patient person in the world, but she won't make a move until she has the conclusive evidence in front of her... well, I should say 'circumstancial' would be the best word."<p>Ranma turned back to the stove, but did nothing with preparing lunch, "This sucks!"<p>"I know it does, Ranma," Nabiki consoled, "but Akane's not going to be in town for long, so we just have to bear with it until then."<p>Ranma remained silent, once again absently stirring the broth, though it didn't need to be. Nabiki realized Ranma's pensive mood, and decided to change the subject. "Shampoo and Happosai have been conspicuous in their absence..."<p>"Where'd they go?" Ranma asked, not really interested in the answer.<p>"Shampoo called and said she would be at the restaurant, learning some cooking techniques from her father and Great-Grandmother. Who knows where Happosai is, but I have a feeling he won't be back for a while."<p>"Hmm," was Ranma's reply, as he once again slipped into fuming over his situation. So lost in his mood, he jumped when he felt a pair of arms encircle his waist.<p>Nabiki leaned her chin against his shoulder, as she reached one hand around to turn down the temperature of the broth, "That means we got the whole house to ourselves, for the time being."<p>Ranma felt the familiar, anticipating flutter in his chest, as he fought down a grin. It was then he realized, "Hey, but didn't you say...?"<p>"My sister's not here right now, is she?" Nabiki whispered in his ear.<p>Ranma smirked, turning around, "No, I guess she isn't, huh? But you never cared if the others were here before."<p>"Then we had to be quiet," Nabiki responded, before giggling.<p>Ranma's eyebrows climbed, being the first time he had actually heard Nabiki giggle. Before he could enquire about it, Nabiki kissed him, while dragging him downwards.<p>"In HERE?" Ranma's voice almost squeaked from below the counterline.<p>_<p>Kasumi sighed in resignation, as she heard the gates in the front open. She didn't have nearly as much time to prepare, what with Akane giving her such short notice, but she still didn't expect her sister to be in for another few minutes, by Akane's estimate ten minutes ago on the phone.<p>Typical, Akane was always punctual when she was in a rightious fury. Kasumi put on her most welcoming expression for her sister, and opened the front door. "Welcome home, Ak-ACK!"<p>"Kasumi dear, are you okay?" Soun enquired, beginning to tear up at the strangling sounds his daughter was making.<p>"Aaaahhh, Kasumi! So good to see you!" Genma bellowed, "Have anything to eat? Training in the deepest wilds tends to man one long for such a great cook's culinary arts!"<p>"But we didn't train in any-"<p>"Jungles! Of course not! You think we could have made it to India in such a scant time?" Genma quickly interjected, quickly pinning Soun's face between his foot and the door.<p>"Amusing," Kasumi stated, dropping her 'good hostess' act, "If you would be so kind as to remove your foot from my father's face? His head seems to be denting the door."<p>"Oh... heh heh... how did that get there?" Genma enquired, chuckling nervously, while relequishing his 'hold' on his training partner.<p>Kasumi patiently waited for her father to recover, lighting a cigerette in her wait. "Now that you've composed yourself, Father, we have a great deal to talk about."<p>"Of course! Of course! I must tell you of my wonderful trip with my dear training partner!" Soun piped up, grinning maddenly.<p>"That's not what she's talking about, Dad." Soun jumped, before turning around, and finding his youngest standing behind him. She didn't look happy at all. He needed to do something fast before she took control of the situation, as Akane was always wont to do...<p>"OH, AKANE! YOU'RE HERE TOO!" Soun wailed, suddenly lunging at his daughter, countering the three subtle defensive postures she shifted through, just slightly turning his shoulder and dropping his elbow into Akane's fist to parry the punch she started to throw at him, and grasping onto her with a vice-like grip in a motion that would have even made Happosai impressed at it's efficiency.<p>Akane reacted accordingly, "ACK! DAD! LET GO!"<p>Soun didn't seem tot hear her, as he continued to lament, "Oh, how an old man can die happy to see all of his daughters once again! I'm so proud of you girls!"<p>"You're shy one daughter," Kasumi commented, before taking another puff of her cigerette.<p>"Hmm, that we are," the Tendou Patriarch said, recovering so fast that Genma missed the transition. Akane also missed it, but she could be forgiven, since she was busy having to reinflate her lungs. "So where is Nabiki? Has she and Ranma married yet?"<p>"NO!" both Akane and Kasumi shouted, indignatly.<p>"Good, I didn't want to miss the ceremony!" Soun replied, jovially. He then turned to his friend, "See, Saotome? Everything worked out fine in the end!"<p>"No, everything is most assuradly NOT fine!" Akane countered, growing rapidly more fustrated by her father's mercurial shifts. It was hard enough trying to maintain some authority on the situation when he kept putting her off guard.<p>"Of course, they should be married right away!" Soun commanded, "Although, I am pretty sure they wouldn't have any qualms towards that..."<p>"Indeed, Tendou. Why, I bet the boy's already consumated their relationship! He *is* my son, after all; the Manliest of Men!" Genma blinked, before feeling a shreak of terror envelop him. Now he remembered what possible problem could have arisen. "Ah... th-the boy is still alive... right?"<p>"Not for long," Akane growled, "And about this insepid agreement the two of you set up. It's gone too damn far!"<p>Soun didn't show it, but nearly flinched at what his daughter implied. He was curious as to why she was in Japan again, and as to why she was angry enough to kill, judging from her intense aura. Putting all the clues together for even a vague picture, he came to a conclusion that his middle daughter just *may* have been lonlier than she had ever let on.<p>"WAAAAAAAA! AKANE YELLED AT ME!" Soun wailed, hiding behind a slightly disgusted Genma. Until he could find out the details, he had to keep his daughters from focusing too much on the subject.<p>Akane groaned, holding her forehead in her palm, as Kasumi snorted in irritance. If things hadn't gotten worse...<p>"Um, has a woman claiming to be my wife, going by 'Nodoka', has she been around?" Genma asked, deciding his need for survival outranked his need to remain inconspicuous.<p>_<p>Happosai entered through the window of the room he *had* been sharing with Ranma, and set down his cherished booty. True, he could have entered through the front door, but it just wasn't the same, and he was pretty sure Nabiki would have nagged him for what was 'rightfully' now his possesions. His arrival was not random, as he had timed it well, knowing what to expect from Nabiki. From the feel of Nabiki's ki level, even from the distance he was at from her, his timing was a bit off.<p>He was hoping to at least catch them in the act.<p>Sighing, the ancient martial artist hopped downstairs, homing in on where he sensed both of his students. Nabiki was sitting at the dining table, smiling almos manically, and sipping on a cup of coffee, as Ranma mopped the floor, turning to glare at her every so often. Happosai estimated they used at least two cans of cherry scented aerisol.<p>"So," Happosai greeted, causing Ranma to jolt, and Nabiki to grin towards the old man, "How has your morning been, students?" Ranma turned deep red, and began to mop the same spot more forcefully.<p>"Well, we have some problems, but it got better," Nabiki replied, turning to watch Ranma work.<p>"Problems?" Happosai enquired, following her gaze. "Something wrong with the floor, Ranma my boy? You've been concentrating on that spot awfully hard..."<p>Nabiki shrugged after taking another sip of her brew, "Oh, he just spilled some juice there, and is a bit self concious about the mess." Ranma almost tripped over the mop handle, before favoring Nabiki with his most heated, indignant, unamused glare. Nabiki made a kissing motion towards him, flustering Ranma even more, and causing him to turn back to his task.<p>Nabiki was using innuendo, she must nearly be drunk off of energy by now, "Have you even told the boy what you've been doing?"<p>Nabiki blinked, "Oh yeah, Ranma, I've been using you to build up my ki by way of sex. Hope you don't mind."<p>Ranma only gave Nabiki a sideways glance, before continuing with the task at hand, "No wonder you're so damn insatiable..." Both Happosai and Nabiki broke out into laughter.<p>Nabiki finally managed to bring herself under control to address more serious matters, "Anyways, we do have another problem. Akane's in town."<p>"Kasumi went and blabbed, huh?" Happosai guessed easily. Not really a surprise, he had decided long ago, that the three girls he had watched grow up into women like he was their grandfather, were rather predictable.<p>"Akane's here, probably with the mind to save me from 'the little perverted troll'. You know how she gets."<p>"You're taking this rather well, considering your panic fit earlier," Ranma quipped, before pushing the bucket and mop to the corner of the counter. "So, she knows all about it, but won't do a thing about it until she catches us with our tongues down each other's throats. Once she does, the big, bad sister's going to go beserk,huh?"<p>"I'm glad you see the picture so well," Nabiki replied, "Don't worry, she should be gone and out of our lives within a week. She does have other obligations, and she doesn't like being away from her sons for too long."<p>Ranma shrugged, sitting at the table, "Don't see why we have to even care."<p>Nabiki stopped from taking another sip of her coffee, glaring at Ranma over the lid, "Are you considering something unintelligent, Ranma?"<p>"No," the pigtailed boy replied, slightly indignant, "I mean, I'm pretty sure she's good, but I can handle her pretty okay, I'm sure."<p>Happosai and Nabiki looked at each other, and closed their eyes in unison.<p>_<p>Soun wasn't disturbed, just surprised. Perhaps he had underestimated his middle daughter, though he always felt she deserved the highest credit, as well as his other two lovely daughters. She always seemed to enjoy a life of contentment, indulging in social activities that fulfilled her role in society as a productive member. She enjoyed her job, as it dealt with one of her loves, money, and it created for a pool of interaction with many different members of the same society she lived in. Nabiki was worldly, sophisticated without being haughty. She was playful, while in her later years fortunately lacking the disregard she used to practice towards others in her youth. She was caring, generous, capable of great understanding, obliging, dedicated, and cautious. He could never miss the wistfulness she expressed over her own solitude, but for the most part, even to him it never seemed to bother her. For all he knew, it never really did.<p>Ranma. The young man he hoped Nabiki would care for, possibly in a maternal fashion, as he left her to 'babysit' him, as he allowed Genma to 'drag' him through Asia. Apparently, the teenage boy played the part of Pandora towards Nabiki's heart, opening a purposely closed container that potentially brought about the ills that would plague Nabiki severalfold; drudging up old hurts, forgotten yearnings, and inhabilitating fears. But in the end, Ranma also released the one thing Nabiki had lacked, for she was content without need of this further. Ranma had opened Nabiki's heart, and released her hope.<p>Hope for something more beyond her, hope for a family, for someone to care for her during her twilight years, hope that she would never be left alone with only her shallow, materialistic prizes that would be worth naught to her when she passed on. This also gave Soun hope, for he now could believe his cherished daughter would not experience the heartache he had felt in his lonliness. Granted, he had his daughters that he oft times had to resort to dramatics in order to keep them involved in his life, but there was always that different need for a love that belonged only between two that were intimately close in ways that could not be expressed with any other relation.<p>His concerns now, was if she even understood the consequences and the sacrifices she would now make, and if she was absolutely and truly willing to make them unonditionally, and selflessly. As for Ranma, he did not know what to expect, and only trusted in his daughter's ability to judge character. If she had fallen for him, he expected Ranma to be a fine young man.<p>"Well, this isn't so bad," Soun piped up, smiling manically and obliviously to his youngest daughter's ire.<p>Akane groaned, grabbing onto hear and wanting to tear it out in fustration. No matter what, her senile father just could not, or would not, see the problem behind the whole ordeal. Genma wasn't helping matters, as he steadfastly held onto a fundamentalist perspective that the schools must be joined, further inciting her own father's stubbornness. "Dad, just think about it, exactly HOW do you think this will all end? There's just TOO much of a difference between them! Can't you just realize this farce is just going to end up hurting Nabiki again?"<p>"It couldn't possibly, it's a matter of family honor!" Soun rebuked firmly, as if his argument were absolutely logical.<p>"Of course, Love conquers all obstacles! Including age!" Genma added, even earning Soun's incredulousness at the statement, though he never visually displayed it.<p>Kasumi wringed her apron in her hands, yearning for a cigerette, but trying to abstain. She had been smoking a lot more lately; a bad thing even in her consideration. "Father, if you truly care for Nabiki, you would simply call this off."<p>"Well, wouldn't that be their decision?" Soun replied, showing a sliver of his true intelligence to his daughters for the first time in ages.<p>Kasumi and Akane seemed to have missed it. "Nabiki's blind to what's happening to her, Dad. She's even trying to cover up for the little twerp!" Akane retorted, "If even realized all that she was doing..."<p>"From what I can see, father, she has been investing a lot of herself into him, I can't see how that would be healthy," Kasumi quipped.<p>"That's perfectly healthy for a relationship!" Soun retorted, "They will be married soon!"<p>"No, they will not," Akane almost growled, "This isn't a 'healthy' relationship by any means. What makes you think... um... Ranma's serious about Nabiki? For all we know, he's just enjoying milking sis for all she's worth!"<p>"I beg to differ," Soun countered, "I have firm belief that Ranma is only the most honorable of young men!"<p>"That's right, Tendou," Genma agreed, "I raised him to be a man among men. Why, the boy is almost as honorable as I am!"<p>"What was your wife's name, ?" Kasumi enquired, almost casually. The stout man squeaked, and attempted to make himself unnoticable. Kasumi gave her sister a small, victorous smile, for having finally taken Genma's opinion out of the equation.<p>Akane smirked back; perhaps now they can finally start talking sense into their father, without the idiot egging him on. Akane also decided for a different tactic, "Dad, I don't doubt the kid has a lot of respect for Nabiki, and feels obliged to her, but is it really fair to tie them together like that? Ranma's going to eventually realize that he isn't *really* in love with Nabiki, and things will just fall apart from there!"<p>Akane walked behind her seated father, and put her hands on his shoulders, "I don't want to see Nabiki... I don't want to see either of them get hurt over this foolishness. They haven't even known each other for three months, and Kasumi's already told me that they are expressing interests in marrying."<p>Soun knew his daughters were stalemated, and could only make pleas for him to drop the agreement. Truth be told, if he truly thought his daughter was unhappy about it all, he would easily do so. Much to Kasumi and Akane's chagrin, however, they were simply providing their father with ample reason to not only continue the pact, but offer his blessings completely. "Enough, this topic is no longer for discussion, but if you believe them to be uncomfortable in any matter in their relationship, I propose a visit. After all, I would greatly enjoy seeing my whole family together, once again. And then, we will also make enquiries as to their satisfaction of the agreement between our two families, if there's any shadow of a doubt towards their happiness, I will leave the choice up to them."<p>"But Dad..." Akane almost yelled, wondering if he even heard what she had been saying.<p>"Tendou!" Genma shouted, almost outraged that their pledge to unite their families was being taken so lightly.<p>"But," Soun interjected, "beyond that, I have no doubt that your girls' fears are unfounded. Perhaps we shall visit them after a proper lunch? It has been much too long since I have sampled your cullinary ability, my dear Kasumi!"<p>Kasumi nodded, and for a fleeting moment considered the prospect of an 'unintentional' food poisoning incident for her father.<p>_<p>"I have returned," Shampoo announced, closing the door behind herself, removed her shoes, and walked into the living room. She stopped abruptly, and took a sniff at the air, "Ranma make it well too obvious."<p>"Make what obvious?" said pigtailed boy enquired, exiting the kitchen, still somewhat sweaty from his workout. Nabiki entered behind him, not really paying attention to where she was heading.<p>Shampoo didn't answer the question, watching where Nabiki's gaze was being held. "Now I see why Nabiki get along with Happosai," the Amazon drolled, rolling her eyes.<p>Nabiki blinked, and turned to look at Shampoo, "Oh, hey, when did you get in?"<p>"Don't mind her, she's been like this all day," Ranma stated, dryly. Nabiki leered, neither confirming or denying alligations, though more not denying.<p>"That why the house smell of body oder and berries?" Shampoo enquired, innocently. It took all her will to keep a straight face, as Ranma blushed deep crimson.<p>Before she could lose it, the front doorbell rang, signaling a route of escape for the lavender haired girl. "Doorbell!" Shampoo chimed, before rushing back for the front hall.<p>Ranma turned to Nabiki with a hooded gaze, "just cool it, alright?"<p>Shampoo opened the door, smiling well to broadly for greeting, "Hello!"<p>"Ah, um, hello. We wish to see Nabiki, is she home?"<p>Shampoo opened her eyes, now taking in who was standing at the door. The one she knew as Nabiki's sister stared at Shampoo impassively, while the other woman that she had seen in pictures around the house was looking upon her with a stoic expression that Shampoo was positive was ready to shatter at any moment. The man who spoke, she vaguely remembered in passing, but the other man, the one she had seen often with Ranma while she was hunting the redheaded girl through China, the one currently petrified with fear, she did recognize well. At the scene, Shampoo knew exactly what to do.<p>"Is wrong house, no speak Japanese well, is sorry." With that, Shampoo slammed the door, and walked off.<p>Soun blinked, before turning to Genma, "Saotome, isn't that the...?"<p>Genma was currently too out of it to confirm.<p>Nabiki turned her amused expression from the berating she was recieving from Ranma towards Shampoo, who passed by them with an indifferent look. The middle aged woman raised an eyebrow, when she heard the doorbell again, ringing furiously, "Um, hold that thought while I get the door, hon..."<p>"Do not answer the door. It a salesman, annoying." Shampoo stated without turning back.<p>"Well, they're apparently not going to go away until someone answers this time," Nabiki stated, grinning at the prospect of making a soliciter cry for mercy. Shampoo shrugged, and continued upstairs; she did her part, and Nabiki wasn't going to pay her any heed. Nabiki had a beeming smile as she answered the door, "Hello, I'm the-... uh..."<p>"And next time we do it in the kitchen, YOU'RE mopping!" Ranma shouted out from behind. Nabiki's mood dropped at a rate succeeding escape velocity.<p>"Do what in the kitchen?" Soun asked his daughter, earning looks from his three other compatriots.<p>"Nothing... nothing in the kitchen," Nabiki quickly squeeked, unprepared for the abrupt sensation of panic for the second time today.<p>Soun blinked, shugged her reaction off, and quickly encompassed his stark rigid daughter in a crushing hug, "Oh, Nabiki, it does a father's heart proud that you are honoring your father's greatest wish in uniting the schools!"<p>Nabiki's eyes found both Akane's and Kasumi's, who each had theirs bearing down on the middle sister like the headlight of an oncoming frieght train. "I-I'm not honoring a wish!" Both Kasumi and Akane looked at each other with wry glances.<p>Soun pulled away from his daughter, holding her at arms length, "What? But Akane and Kasumi said you intend to marry Ranma."<p>"Ahhh... did I?" Nabiki managed to say, earning solumn nods from her two sisters. The middle sister turned to her father with a cracked smile, "Ah... I was mistaken, heh, heh."<p>"Mistaken about your announcement to marry Ranma, or mistaken in what you had just told father?" Kasumi enquired with false sweetness.<p>Nabiki was just completly unprepared, "Um, both?"<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, Nabiki was saved, as Ranma came up behind her, "Hey, who's at the..." Rana's gaze first found the stocky statue amidst the Tendou's. "Pop..." Ranma said, almost lyrically, "I missed ya."<p>The sound of his son's voice brought Genma out of his stupor. "Boy, I can see you're slacking in you're training."<p>Ranma blinked, and tilted his head, "Oh, it is? Well, I'm grateful for your opinion Pop..."<p>Genma snorted, before pushing his glasses higher onto his nose, "Well I'm glad the woman at least taught you some respe-WHOA!"<p>"HEY, DON'T RUN, POP! I NEED YOUR FULL EVALUATION OF HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN SLACKING!" Ranma demanded, recovering for his missed drop kick, and chasing after his father.<p>Soun easily ignored the father and son running off into the distance, "Now, Nabiki, you're not going to let your dear father stand outside your door? We have much to catch up on!" Nabiki suddenly noticed. Her father, he ws completely clueless to the situation, yet...<p>He was staring at her, the way Kasumi always did when she was anticipating a lie. The way Akane did whenever she was watching her opponent closely in a sparring match. The way she herself did in her youth. It didn't occur to Nabiki often, but perhaps her father may not be as dense as he seemed?<p>Steeling herself, and giving one quick glance to her sisters, Nabiki stepped aside. "Forgive my manners, you certainly taught me better than that, right, Daddy?" She had disregarded the thought, as she always does. She loved her father, but she doubted he could keep such an act up for years. Nonetheless, she still held a slight tone of suspicion in her voice.<p>Soun's smile as he stepped past his daughter faltered for the briefest moment, before he turned back to Nabiki, "Oh, such a minor issue, as you've had a great deal on your mind, I suppose." He hadn't missed the sudden shift in his daughter's tone, throwing him slightly off-balance. He wasn't completely sure what it was about, but entertained the notion that perhaps one of his daughters, after thirty years, finally bought a clue.<p>Nabiki allowed her sisters to pass, before looking out the door, and checking to ensure that Ranma hadn't chased his father back. Sighing, as her concern was not validated, she closed it, "I request that we wait to talk about things until Ranma gets back. I'll make us some tea while we wait."<p>"That won't be necessary," Kasumi interjected, "I don't really believe Ranma is necessary right now, and I can make tea as you talk with father and Akane. You still keep it in the upper left cubboards?"<p>Akane shifted her eyes to Kasumi, before looking back at Nabiki, "Yes, the sooner we get things clarified, the better."<p>Nabiki began to sweat at the pressure her sisters were beginning to compound upon her, "B-but you guys just got here! Why don't we talk about other things... how was your trip, Daddy?"<p>"Splendid, now, about you and Ranma's engagement?" Soun enquired, quickly changing back the subject.<p>Akane favored Nabiki with a cattish smirk, while mouthing 'nice try'. Even for all her nervousness, Nabiki's mouth twitched at the rather childish snipe. Her irritation was the anchor she needed to get ahold of herself. Narrowing her eyes, she then folded her arms, and matched her younger sister's glare, "I think we can wait a few more moments. It does concern him, anyhow." Akane blinked, wondering exactly when her sister regained her nerve.<p>"That tea sounds exellent," Soun quickly spoke up, heading off a potential clash. It didn't happen often, but when his daughters squared off against one another, it always got too out of hand.<p>Nabiki held her glare for a few moments, before turning away, "Right, I'll go start the water."<p>"Hey, I'm back," Ranma proclaimed, swinging open the front door, and tossing his unconcious father in, "Sorry it was taking so long, but the old jerk can run pretty fast." Ranma started to approach Nabiki, before he paused. The middle Tendou sister saw the brief flicker of sadness and fustration cross before Ranma's face, before he gave a haughty smirk, "Ms. Tendou, this your family, right? Want me to go ahead and get me and Pops something to eat while you talk with them?"<p>Both Kasumi and Akane stared at Ranma. Both already knew the truth, but were far from amused at the sudden formality the pigtailed young man was using with their sister. He was trying to help Nabiki cover the truth up from their father, which would make it difficult for them to bring the situation and it's numerous problems out into the open where they would force their family to confront them. On the plus side, Nabiki's denials were making it easier for them to make an argument, but if Ranma wasn't going to fess up to anything, they wouldn't even have a case.<p>"But Ranma, wouldn't you want to eat with your fiancee?" Kasumi asked, causing everyone to focus on him.<p>Once again, Ranma's eyes shifted to Nabiki, before he looked back at Kasumi, innocently, "Fiancee?"<p>Soun saw the swirl of emotions that Ranma held, as he was forced into an obvious lie. He almost frowned, before he gained ahold of himself, and burst into tears. "WHAT? SO YOU PLANNED ON SIMPLY USING MY DAUGHTER FOR YOUR PERVERTED PLEASURES?" Perhaps startling the young lad into admitting the relationship would get him some answers.<p>"YA WHOA!" Ranma shouted, backing up from the overbearing expression of the Tendou Patriarch, as he looked down upon the pigtailed young man with intense fury. Both Kasumi and Akane smiled, feeling it time to add fuel to the fire.<p>Kasumi opened her mouth, "STOP IT!"<p>And then Kasumi closed her mouth, staring at Nabiki, who had interposed herself between Ranma and her father "Nabiki?"<p>The middle Tendou sister turned to Kasumi, "Its obvious what you're doing. You think if you get Daddy on your side, you'll have the leeway to break apart me and Ranma." Everyone blinked at the declaration, including a freshly revived Genma.<p>Nabiki turned back to Ranma, giving him an apologetic smile, "Sorry to put you through all that, I guess you had the right idea." Ranma opened his mouth, but found nothing to say. Instead he held Nabiki around the waist from behind her, lending her his strength.<p>Overlapping her arms on his, Nabiki accepted it, knowing he was now behind her completely. "Yes, Daddy, your precious dream looks to be close to reality, but don't think it has anything to do with the notion of honoring a family pledge."<p>"Nabiki, I don't understand," Soun stated, actually confused in this instance.<p>Nabiki bowed her head slightly, looking at her father from under her bangs, "Truth is, Ranma has proven to me, time and time again, that he is a man of honor. Even if we are more or less a missmatched couple, he has shown me more care, more committment..." Nabiki closed her eyes, and smiled in rememberance, "...and more love, than any man I had ever felt affection to. He is a man any woman would fall in love with, regardless of his many faults. One fault I know he would never have, is the one for abandoning me. He's helped me through a lot, and if I hadn't ever met him, I don't think I would have ever found what I feel only with him."<p>Ranma hid his own face in the crook of Nabiki's neck; it proved to be the most convenient place to hide his tears. No matter how many times he had heard Nabiki acceptance of him, it still touched him deeper than any affection he had ever known. The degrees the emotions Nabiki could invoke within him were almost overwhelming.<p>Nabiki felt the hot tears drip against her chin. Her own smile grew deeper, as her own eyes watered. "If you haven't figured it out, Daddy, I love him. I've found someone I can truly love as my own."<p>Soun's head raised slowly, feeling his own eyes becoming irritable. He had hoped Nabiki would learn to love again, but he never expected the success of his plans. Nabiki was a grown woman, and he respected her judgement, so he would not question how she felt about such a young man. For her to speak so deeply of him, show how much character Genma's son truly had, and at any age, Soun would be honored to leave such a man with his daughter's care.<p>With a genuine smile of contentment, a smile he hadn't worn in ages, Soun bowed,"Yes, it is apparent you have, my daughter." He looked to Ranma, "Thank you, Son. You have truly accomplished an old man's greatest wish."<p>Awkwardly, Ranma nodded, "I am honored to marry your daughter, regardless of how old-WHUFF... er... well regardless."<p>Soun chucked, as his daughter retracted her elbow from his ribs, "Indeed, son." He enveloped the couple in a hug that was far from overexaggurated, overemotional embraces, the onw happened to be perfect in expressing his sentiments, as it was returned in the same manner by both Nabiki and Ranma.<p>Akane's expression was neutral, as she strode towards the front door. Kasumi bowed her head, knowing there was nothing more she could do. The only thing she could do was simply wait to pick up the pieces of Nabiki's shattered heart once again, and hope it wouldn't be as destructive as before. Defeated, she turned away from the scene, and followed her youngest sister.<p>Genma removed his glasses and polished them, blaming the grime they collected for his blurring vision. He was very proud of his son, even if he was impudent at times. But at this moment, he didn't think he could be any prouder. Shampoo sat near the top of the stairs, smiling softly. "{This, Ranma, is what a happy ending truly is,}" she said to herself in her native tongue. No Disney film could ever compare to the true life event before her. Now with the coast clear, she decided to come downstairs, and add her own well-wishes.<p>_<p>They both bid Shampoo goodbye for the evening, as she decided to spend more time with her father. She intended to help him and her great Grandmother run the restaurant, and with the next day being school, she would at least take a bit of time to help him set up the restaurant, and talk in the process.<p>Ranma closed the door behind Shampoo, and then sighed as he leaned against it, "Well, Guess it's been a pretty long day so far."<p>Nabiki nodded, and looked back towards the living room, "Thanks Ranma, for what you tried to do earlier."<p>Ranma knew what she was talking about, "Hey, you asked me to, even if you realized I was right later on."<p>Nabiki leaned against Ranma, pinning him against the door, "Don't get cocky now, Mr. Saotome. I may have given you the benefit of the doubt, but don't think I'm just going to accept your word all the time."<p>Ranma chuckled, giving Nabiki a light peck on the nose, "Yeah, well, I can still be content with this little victory. Too bad your sisters wouldn't accept us. I mean, I woulda thought if they saw you happy, they would finally understand."<p>Nabiki shook her head softly, "I know, Ranma, but they'll come around in time. They have the rest of our lives to get used to the idea."<p>"I guess," Ranma wrapped his arms around his fiancee, "So, what do we do now?"<p>With a delicious gleam in her eye, Nabiki began circling her finger against Ranma's chest, "Well, I guess we can start moving onto... heh heh, more advanced techniques..."<p>Before Ranma could enquire about said techniques, they were interrupted by a knock at the door, the type of knock that punches a hole through wooden barriers, before a hand wraps itself around a certain pigtailed young man's neck.<p>"Someone's at the door," Ranma managed to choke out, before he was pulled through the barrier, obliterating it.
