</div>'Older'<p>"Good morning, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed boy looked over his shoulder after entering the kitchen, to find Nabiki already sitting at the table with her morning coffee. Today, since there wasn't any school, Ranma had chosen to sleep in, with only marginal success. Even at the attempt, Nabiki was still able to wake up before him. Once again, she favored him with that greeting smile that she had been presenting to him every morning since almost a week ago.<p>The first few times, it made Ranma more than a bit nervous and apprehensive, until he began to realize that she was also being nicer to him... a lot nicer. After a couple of days, he found her smile probably a better stimulous for the morning than a good stretch, and as soothing as a wind down. By now, he had come to greatly appreciate those smiles.<p>"Hey, Nabiki, doin' good this morning?" Ranma returned, exchanging the older woman's smile for his most ungaurded one. Nabiki nodded cheerfully, and held up her cup of coffee to show it was going fine at the moment.<p>"Can't think of anything to change it, so far, you have a good night's sleep?"<p>Ranma nodded, but didn't comment on it. After looking around a bit, he turned back to Nabiki, "Want me to fix breakfast?"<p>"That's okay, Ranma-hon, I picked something up for the two of us last night. Shampoo had to go help make the final preparations on the restaurant today, and left early." Nabiki motioned Ranma to sit across the table from her, before opening the white paper bag that was before her.<p>"Yeah, she's been really busy at that place," Ranma commented, sitting down at the dining table.<p>"She seems to want to keep busy lately," Nabiki mused, handing Ranma a pastry on a napkin.<p>"Huh? Wuzzis?"<p>"Bear claw, picked it up from a shop near where I work." Nabiki winked at Ranma, "Figured a young, fit guy like you could easily burn off the sugar."<p>Ranma studied the pastry, and took a bite before speaking, "And what about you? Afraid of these things going to your hips?"<p>Nabiki chuckled at Ranma's teasing, before giving him a mock pout, "What? You think I'm getting too pudgy?"<p>Involinarily, Ranma found himself studying Nabiki, before turning away, nervously, "N-na... I guess you keep pretty busy."<p>Nabiki had to hold back her laugh, lest she sprayed Ranma with her mouthful of food. She got up, and walked past Ranma to the coffee pot for a refill, ruffling his hair as she went by. "You're just too cute sometimes, Ranma."<p>Ranma smoothed his hair down, barely even considering to make an objection to the woman's action, "Yeah, well, it's the only way Ranma Saotome can be, I guess."<p>"Mmm," Nabiki agreed, patting Ranma's shoulder when she came back around, while sipping from her fresh poured coffee. She took the chair next to his without thinking about it. "So, what were your plans for today, Ranma?"<p>Ranma shrugged, "Dunno, didn't really think of anything special, why?"<p>Nabiki sighed, "Ranma, were you planning on just staying around here? Don't you have anything that interests you?"<p>Ranma took another bite of his morning meal, "Well, guess I can check out the manga shops, or just walk around for a while."<p>"That doesn't sound like a bad idea," Nabiki considered, chewing on her thumb in thought, "Mind if I join you? I could probably show you some interesting places around the town if you like."<p>"Sure!" Ranma replied, somewhat eagerly, before calming down, "I mean, I guess it's better than just walking around aimlessly, ya know?"<p>Nabiki shrugged nonchilantly, "Sometimes it's not a bad thing. You could find some interesting places just by meandering."<p>"Like cursed springs?" Ranma enquired in a wry tone.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes, "That was planned stupidity on your father's behalf." At that, both laughed until breathing was once again required. Neither looked up from the able as their breaths returned to normal. Nabiki sighed, before blinking, and looking to her side. Ranma's eyes opened a bit wider in curiosity, and followed her gaze.<p>At the sight of Nabiki's hand gently resting on Ranma's forearm, they both froze, and looked back at each other. After several agonizing moments of silence, Nabiki slowly retracted her hand, "I... I better go get dressed."<p>"Uh, yeah," Ranma replied, idly rubbing his arm where Nabiki had been resting her hand.<p>_<p>After taking more than enough time dressing herself, Nabiki was satisfied that she had relaxed. She wasn't sure what had happened, but it had felt more than a little awkward. Just as she was putting her cell-phone into her pocket, it began to ring. Musing over who would be calling her at that time of morning, she read the caller ID, surprised to find it coming from the Tendou Dojo, "Hello?"<p>"[Aunt Nabiki?]"<p>"Who else would have my phone, Kaoru-dear?" Nabiki asked in a wry tone, "What's up?"<p>"[Oh, sorry. I was wondering if Ranma was around. If we could... hang out or something?]"<p>Nabiki felt a slight bit of disappointment at his request, but smirked ferally, "Sure you're not looking for a certain redhead?" She stifled a chuckle, while listening to the long pause, followed by a hard, audible gulp from the other end of the line.<p>"[Um... n-no... j-just Ranma is f-fine.]" Kaoru stammered, making it heavily obvious that he was trying to maintain his composure. Nabiki covered the mouthpiece, as she finally had to give in to her laughter.<p>Realizing her plans with Ranma for the day were now probably shot, Nabiki replied, albeit in a slightly defeated tone, "Alright, I'll hand you over to him." She walked into the house, finding Ranma about to exit to the back yard in order to work out for a little bit. "Ranma, Kaoru's calling about you."<p>At the name, the pigtailed boy paused, and turned to accept the phone, nodding to Nabiki in appreciation, "Sup?"<p>"[Ranma?]"<p>"That's me, ya need something?"<p>"[Did you have any plans today?]"<p>"Ah..." Ranma held his answer, turning to look at Nabiki. Even though she didn't hear it, she knew the question, and nodded in understanding. Ranma's gaze lingered, as if making sure she was okay with it, "... I guess not."<p>"[I was hoping we could probably spar some more, and you teach me a thing or two?]"<p>"Well, I ain't much of a teacher, you know... but I guess it's cool." The pigtailed martial artist replied, scratching the back of his head.<p>"[Cool! Here at the dojo, then?]"<p>Ranma shrugged, regardless of Kaoru could see it or not, "Can't think of a better place. Meet you there at what time?"<p>"[How about at noon? We could have mom fix us some lunch before we do anything,]" Kaoru responded eagerly, "[Sound good to you?]"<p>"It's a plan, meet you then." Ranma hung up the phone, and handed it back to Nabiki, "Guess I'm going to be going to the Tendou Dojo today." Nabiki nodded, and turned to return to her room to dress in some more casual clothing for around the house. "Wanna come?"<p>Nabiki almost twirled around, "Sure, I could talk with Sis while you to go at it."<p>"That's cool, wouldn't want to bore you with our monotonous sparring," Ranma replied, half-jokingly.<p>"Ranma, watching you is anything but boring."<p>_<p>Kaoru hung up the phone, with his spirits a bit higher than before, "Mom?"<p>Kasumi came from the tea room, where she had been enjoying a cigerette and watching TV after finishing the dishes for breakfast, "Yes, Kaoru-dear?"<p>"Ranma's coming over at about noon. Would it be too much to ask if you made us something for before we start training?"<p>"You don't have to be so formal about asking me to make lunch, dear," Kasumi replied, smiling.<p>Kaoru shrugged, "Can't help it, think I get that from Dad and you."<p>Kasumi's smile faded somewhat, "More from your father, I would think. He always did have a problem relaxing..."<p>Kaoru favored his mother with a hooded gaze, before plucking the cigerette from her fingers, "Riiiight, maybe he should take up smoking, so I could have two parents with tar-filled lungs?"<p>Kasumi's smile completely faded for her usual no-nonsense expression. She held out her hand expectantly, "Do you want me to fix you lunch or not?"<p>Sighing, Kaoru handed his mother back her lit cigerette, "Mom, you know those things aren't good for you."<p>"People say the same thing about childbirth," Kasumi replied with mirth, letting her son know she was only joking. "Was Nabiki coming with her?"<p>Kaoru shrugged, "Dunno, I could call and find out, if you like?"<p>"That's okay, dear. I'm pretty sure she'll be along, too. We have a few things to talk about, after all."<p>"If you say so, Mom."<p>_<p>"Sure, we'll spar first,"Ranma replied, not seeing any problems with it. Maybe this way, he would be able to figure out how best to help the younger boy train. From what Ranma remembered, Kaoru had a lot of power and precision in his attacks. The younger boy had a great deal of speed, but Ranma easily stayed on top of it. A big issue, Ranma could recall, was Kaoru's moves read like the morning paper. Since his hands almost always stayed at guard, he didn't bother to hide the shifting of his fingers, when he was readying a pressure point attack, and most of his attacks were highly linear, shotokan style. He was too busy trying to rush Ranma down that he had never noticed Ranma easily outpacing him.<p>Ranma relaxed into back legged stance, not even bothering to put his arms in defense, "Ready whenever you are."<p>Kaoru twitched a bit, as the thought that Ranma wasn't taking this seriously crossed his mind. He put the thought away, deciding it would be Ranma's mistake.<p>"Kaoru's been pretty excited about this all morning," Kasumi commented, holding Sie in her lap as she and Nabiki sat on the dojo floor.<p>"It's a good thing he called," Nabiki replied, turning to look at her sister, "Ranma pretty much had resigned himself to just sitting around the house today."<p>"Oh? And what were you planning on doing during the day?" Kasumi asked, prodding into the subject.<p>Nabiki didn't seem to notice, "Sit around the house, I guess. I probably would have run a few errands, but I didn't have any definite plans." Exept for the one that Kaoru unwittingly interrupted, but she wasn't going to blame her nephew for that.<p>Kaoru quickly rushed at Ranma, doing well not to cock his fist back for the punch, but still easily telling Ranma his intentions. The pigtailed boy effortlessly leaned to the side away from the punch, and swerved back the other direction from the follow up side-thrust kick. Ranma then spun against Kaoru's following back fist, putting him too close within range for the attack to connect.<p>The younger boy jumped back, already feeling fustrated, "How, how do you do it?"<p>"Well, I see what you're about to do before you do it. You're good, but you just tend to announce your moves more than a bad manga."<p>"Ranma!"<p>The pigtailed boy flinched at Nabiki's voice, and turned back to a fuming Kaoru with a chagrinned expression, "Ah... what I meant was you're fast and all, but I can see your attacks coming from a mile away."<p>A damp wash rag slapped against the side of Ranma's face, drawing his attention to an unamused Kasumi, and a glaring Nabiki. Even through her glare, Ranma could see her trying to hide her urge to laugh.<p>"Oh, shut up, you," Ranma replied with humor in his voice, tossing the rag back at Nabiki, causing her to quickly block it before losing her stern expression and chuckling, "Even an old woman like you could see his punches."<p>"Uh, thanks for the critism, Ranma," Kaoru started in an overly polite, but terse voice, "But if you would rather 'critique' my abilities, rather than show me how to fix them, I-"<p>"Relax, I'm just kidd'n with ya," Ranma replied, patting the younger boy on the shoulder. "Check this out, instead of starting your punches from here, try pushing off with your back foot like this with your fist here..."<p>Kasumi leaned back, and spoke to Nabiki without turning towards her, "I see you haven't quite got him courtesy-trained yet."<p>"I've been working on it, sis," Nabiki replied, sighing to calm herself down.<p>"So, how long do you intend to have Ranma staying with you? You said his mother's been making regular visits?"<p>"As long as he wants to stay," Nabiki replied without hesitation.<p>"But..." Kasumi paused, trying to think of a way to ask her question without tipping Nabiki's suspicion, "Surely Ranma would like to get reaquainted with his mother... Nabiki?"<p>"Oh? Sorry, wasn't paying attention," Nabiki apologised, turning from watching Ranma teach Kaoru a few things.<p>Kasumi bit her lip, noticing Nabiki's more than casual interest in the young man, and decided to broach the subject directly, but delicately, "Nabiki, how have you and Ranma been getting along? I hope he hasn't been putting you out too much."<p>"He's not a bother at all," the middle Tendou sister responded, leaning forward in her lotus position, almost studying the way Ranma was demonstrating techniques, "In fact, I would miss him if he left."<p>"Don't you mean 'when' he left?"<p>Nabiki sniffed, and cocked her head nonchilantly, "You know what I mean. Ranma-hon's been staying there for over a month, now, but he's grown on me. He can be obnoxious sometimes, but he's a really sweet guy."<p>"Yes... sweet," Kasumi mocked, thinking back to only three minutes ago.<p>"Well, you just got to look past his little moments. Deities know we all have them."<p>"It's good that you're able to look past them," Kasumi replied, "especially with him being so, well, let's just say that teenagers will be teenagers, if you know what I mean." Kasumi knew what words to emphesize in that sentance.<p>Nabiki hummed, noncommitingly, almost not paying attention to Kasumi.<p>"Does Ranma mean a lot to you?"<p>"He-" Nabiki cut off her reply, sharply turning to look at Kasumi, "Sis, are you implying something?"<p>Kasumi had to wonder if Nabiki was as truly dense as their father to miss such obvious proddings until now. Maybe she was just playing dumb, "Nabiki, about this engagement..."<p>"I thought you would have dropped that stupid idea by now," Nabiki quipped, though a bit fast for a natural response.<p>"I never held it in the first place... how about you?"<p>"You're kidding, Right Kasumi?" Nabiki enquired, pointadly ensuring not to look back at Ranma, "Listen, me and Ranma-hon are just friends. He's a great guy to be around, and I enjoy his company. There's nothing more to it."<p>"I wouldn't doubt it," Kasumi quickly offered, before her sister became too defensive. The eldest Tendou daughter sincerely wished Akane had fallen for the bait, and came home by now to straighten Nabiki out, "It's just... just that..."<p>Kasumi sighed, and set back to adjust the half-asleep boy in her lap, "I hope you know what your doing, Nabiki."<p>"Trust me, there's nothing going on, alright? So let's just drop the subject."<p>"Hey, Nabiki, you okay?"<p>Nabiki looked up to Ranma's concerned expression, as he stood beside Kaoru testing out the movements Ranma had shown him. She gave him a smile, before replying, "Don't worry about it, Ranma, thanks for asking."<p>Ranma smiled back, and nodded. He turned back around to watch Kaoru. Nabiki's smile remained. Though slightly faded, it held a slight contention in it that Kasumi could not mistake in it's meaning.<p>Kaoru glanced surrepticiously at Ranma, still practicing the punch, before speaking, "Something going on between you and Aunt Nabiki?"<p>"What?" Ranma nearly shouted. He quickly turned to see if Nabiki and Kasumi had noted his outburst, if they did, they didn't seem to care. Ranma turned back to Kaoru, "Where'd you get that idea?"<p>"Dunno," Kaoru replied, trying to sound casual, "Just that she seems to like you, I think." The younger boy stopped practicing to give Ranma his undivided attention.<p>"There ain't anything between me and that ol-... between me and Nabiki, alright?" Ranma replied, a bit more forcefully than required for his rebuke.<p>"Okay, just curious," Kaoru replied. He internally sighed; it was weird to think of his aunt with a younger... waaaaayyyyyy younger guy. Not that he didn't realize, on an intellectual level, that his aunt was extremely attractive for her age, the thought of her with a guy half her age was... weird... to say the least.<p>After that inquiry, Kaoru had an even more difficult question to ask, "Then..."<p>Ranma glared at him with an expression that was expecting, yet just daring Kaoru to continue that line of topic. Fortunately, he wouldn't have to deal with the consequences of doing so, just the consequences of the next topic, "... what about you and Rachael?"<p>Ranma's mouth twitched, before setting into a cracked, nervous smile, "What about her?"<p>"Anything g-going on... between you and... and her?" Kaoru was almost sweating, not from the work out, but from the effort of keeping himself from breaking down in thought of the beautiful redhead.<p>Ranma glowered, "Trust me, if I had my say, I would have nothing to do with her."<p>Kaoru baulked at the reply, "Why? She's gorgeous!"<p>"Well," Ranma said with no little pride, "I guess she is pretty hot..."<p>"And just whom are you two talking about?" Nabiki enquired, overhearing the last part of their conversation, as her nephew had exclaimed it rather loud, causing her to focus just in time to hear what Ranma said.<p>"No one!" They both quickly replied in stereo.<p>Nabiki blinked at Ranma's hasty response, and blushed slightly as the thought of it possibly being her Ranma was referring to. Kasumi glanced sideways at Nabiki, before trying to sound almost casual about her next question, "So, considered any new boyfriends, lately?"<p>Nabiki's expression darkened, "I thought we agreed to drop it?"<p>"I'm not talking about Ranma," Kasumi replied, almost smugly, since she pretty much had her suspicions confirmed, "I mean, any guys caught your interest lately?"<p>"Look, I thought we came to an agreement a while back that my lovelife is my own business?" Nabiki replied, sharply.<p>"Oh my, I don't recall ever making that agreement," Kasumi replied in an imitation of her vapid tone, while bringing her mouth to her hand.<p>"Mom? What are you doing?"<p>"Nooooothing!" Kasumi replied in a sing-song voice.<p>Kaoru snorted, knowing his mother was probably teasing his aunt again. He turned his attention back to Ranma, "So, you mean to say that she's free?"<p>"No, she's most definitely *not* free," Ranma replied in an aggrivated tone.<p>Kaoru's eyes narrowed, "I thought you said you weren't interested in her?"<p>"I... I'm not!"<p>"It isn't because she's a lesbian, is it?" Kaoru asked, feeling the urge to sulk. Ranma was probably just protecting the redhead's interests from guys who were pushy.<p>"What? She isn't a lesbian!" Ranma replied, confused as to where Kaoru got that idea.<p>"She isn't?"<p>"Heh, I'm pretty sure of that," Ranma chuckled, scratching the back of his head, nervously.<p>"I see." Kaoru replied, darkly, before putting on a mask of cheer, "Well, I guess we should go wash up, then."<p>Ranma blinked, as Kaoru walked by him, "Huh? That all we gonna do?"<p>"I think it's time we wrapped this up, myself," Nabiki commented in a tone that stated she wasn't interested in staying much longer. She got up, and headed for the house, "Coming, Ranma?"<p>Both Kasumi and Ranma looked at each other, and shrugged.<p>_<p>Ranma every so often looked towards Nabiki out of the corner of his eye. He had no idea what had gone on between her and Kasumi, but it left her in a little less of a pleasant mood. She had been quiet since they left the dojo, and he was beginning to find it wreaking havoc on his anxiety.<p>When Nabiki pulled out onto the highway, Ranma decided he really needed to know what was bothering her, "Nabiki, what were you and Kasumi talking about?"<p>Nabiki fought down the urge to give a scathing reply, since it wasn't his fault, "Don't worry about it, just something between me and Sis."<p>"She must have ticked you off royally, huh?"<p>"Ranma," Nabiki replied, sighing his name, "It's not really any of your business, okay?"<p>"Alright, you don't have to bite my head off, geez..." Ranma turned away, "See if I show you any concern again..."<p>Nabiki was still fuming, and had yet to vent, "Then what were you and Kaoru talking about? He decided to end that training session rather quickly."<p>To Nabiki's surprise, Ranma's expression darkened, but he answered, "He asked me if 'Racheal' was a lesbian..."<p>That... managed to lighten Nabiki's mood considerably, "Heh, what?"<p>Ranma glared at Nabiki for making light of it, "You heard me."<p>Nabiki chuckled for a couple of moments, "And you're upset about this exactly why?"<p>"I'm not a lesbian, so it ain't funny."<p>"Ranma..." Nabiki managed to calm herself down a bit, before continuing, "I hate to tell you this, but you are... when you're a girl, at least." She paused, and thought about it for a second, "At least, I HOPE you are... not that there would be anything wrong with it... or would there?" At her personal inquiry, Nabiki laughed, "Ranma-hon, I bet things get pretty confusing for you, don't they?"<p>"But I'm not a girl, so I can't be a lesbian, I'm a guy!" Ranma argued, finding his own heat in her mirth.<p>Nabiki reached over, and poked Ranma in the nose with her index finger, "The most anatomically incorrect guy in the world, half the time."<p>"And what's that supposed to mean?" Ranma asked in an arched tone that Nabiki recognised meant he was prepared to pursue an argument.<p>"What it means, Ranma, is wet or dry, you're always going to be a guy on the inside, but on the outside, you're physically a girl, as far as I know at least. Since you're interested in women and not guys, when you're a girl, that classifies you as a lesbian."<p>Ranma wanted to argue further, but had difficulty faulting the logic, "Whatever..."<p>"That doesn't explain what put my nephew in such a huff, Ranma-hon."<p>"I guess he was disappointed when I told him she wasn't available after telling him I'm not... she wasn't a lesbian." Ranma blinked, and cast an accusing eye at the driver of the white BMW he was in, "Exactly where, prey tell, would he have gotten such a rediculous idea, by the way?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, unaware of Ranma's impending attitude, "He was asking about you the other day, so I steered him off. I figured you would rather deal with the label than constant harrassment from other guys."<p>"You didn't have to tell him THAT, though!"<p>"If I had known you would be this upset about it, maybe not," Nabiki replied in an arched tone. "Too late, now, may as well bear with it."<p>"Thanks a lot." From the way Ranma had said it, it didn't seem as if he was gratified by her intervention.<p>Nabiki playfully stuck her tongue out at the fuming pigtailed boy, "I'm sorrrrrryyyyyyy."<p>"For an old woman, you sure act immature, you know that?"<p>"You bring it out of me, Ranma-hon," Nabiki replied in a saccarine sweet tone.<p>"Just watch the road, will ya?" Ranma commented trying not to smile. At least now Nabiki wasn't upset about whatever it was Kasumi was discussing with her. That in itself made Ranma feel a bit more content. Only because he didn't want to have to deal with her attitude, that's all.<p>_<p>"Welcome to Ucchan's! Hey sugar, what's up?" Ukyo greeted her first friend in Nerima. Her cheer waned somewhat, when she noticed his troubled expression, "Let me fix you up something, on the house."<p>"Thanks, Ukyo, but I'm not all that hungry," Kaoru commented, sitting down.<p>"Oh boy, coming to Ucchan's without an appetite is a crime, don't you know?" Ukyo chuckled in a way to invite the younger boy to join in her cheer as she reoiled her grill.<p>The chef looked up when it didn't seem to work. "Ranma told me that Rachael wasn't a lesbian."<p>Ukyo stopped short, and blinked for several moments before replying, "Why the hell would he tell you that?"<p>Kaoru shrugged, not actually looking at Ukyo, "Don't know, but I think I believe him."<p>"Why you say that?"<p>"I think Ranma and Racheal..." Kaoru gulped, but resigned himself to the obvious reality, "...they're together." It was Kaoru's turn to blink, before looking over the counter in concern, "You okay, Ukyo?"<p>The Okonomiyaki chef had managed to push herself away from the grill when she stumbled, to ensure she didn't manage to burn her face off. "I-I'm fine," Ukyo replied, barely able to contain her laughter. As it was, her face was beet red, causing Kaoru some concern.<p>"You sure? You look pretty flush. Maybe you should sit down for a moment..."<p>"I'm fine, I'm fine," Ukyo consoled, before taking deep breaths to calm herself down, "listen, Kaoru. You can't let this get you down. Just because Ranma and Racheal are... like one..." Ukyo stopped to snicker, "It doesn't mean that you don't have a chance, you know? Have you tried talking to her, yourself?"<p>"Ah... just thinking about her makes me break out into a sweat," Kaoru replied, dejected, "It's hopeless, anyways."<p>"Kaoru, sugar, as I told you earlier, the key is confidence. This is what you do; you go up to her, and imagine that she isn't going to say 'no', got that?"<p>"Uh... isn't that a tad presumptuous?" Kaoru enquired, trying to find a flaw with Ukyo's proposed stratagy.<p>"Do you want the girl of your dreams, or not?" Ukyo asked, flatly.<p>"I just don't think I can compete with Ranma," the young man resigned himself, "He's a better martial artist than me, he's living with her under Aunt Nabiki's roof... he's got the advantage over me in everything that counts."<p>"Not quite everything," Ukyo commented in a quiet voice, before speaking up, "I'm pretty sure there are one or two things you have over the jerk!"<p>"Like what?"<p>"Well," Ukyo began, "You're patient, courteous, smart, respectful, not a jerk..." Ukyo flashed Kaoru a brilliant smile, "What girl wouldn't fall for you?"<p>"Sounds like you've been thinking quite a bit about this," Kaoru enquired, with a suggestive humor.<p>"Ah..." Ukyo baulked, "I... NO! I mean, it's not that you aren't a great guy and all, but... um..."<p>Kaoru chuckled, partially glad to have changed the subject, "That's okay, Ukyo. I understand your guy problems, though it wouldn't be healthy to hold your grudge against this childhood friend of yours. You'll probably never see him again, anyways."<p>"If that were true..." Ukyo trailed off. "Anyways, just because Ranma has the home-field advantage, doesn't mean that the game's over before you played, Sugar."<p>"You're right, I guess it's worth a shot, at least."<p>"That's the spirit!" Ukyo congradulated, before pouring batter onto the grill, "So, what'll it be? You need to feed that growing confidence of yours, you know?"<p>_<p>"I thank you for your assistance in preparing the Cat Cafe, Shampoo," Cologne told her great-granddaughter, "You've been spending a great deal of time here, with that assistance."<p>"I only want to help you get everything ready, Great-Grandmother," Shampoo replied in broken speech that was still much better than a few days ago.<p>"A great deal of time here... away from son-in-law," Cologne continued; her tone changing to disapproval.<p>"Aiyaaa. I did not realize it, Great-Grandmother."<p>"We're both sure you had, don't patronize me, young lady," Cologne admonished, before sighing, "At least your Japanese has improved greatly during the time. Perhaps now Ranma will take you a little more seriously?"<p>"If he not taking me seriously, I make him do so."<p>Cologne wondered if her Great-Granddaughter truly missed her point, or simply dodged it. "Shampoo, why don't you bring Son-in-law by on the grand-opening? It's been too long since I've seen the lad."<p>"Um, if that what you wish..."<p>"Yes, it is," Cologne answered, flatly, "I'm not going to say this again, Shampoo. I want an honest, sincere effort put forth to getting your husband. If not, I will have to make my own arrangements, understand?"<p>Shampoo smiled nervously, and nodded, dutifully.<p>_<p>Nabiki opened the door, and allowed Ranma to enter first. With a smile, Ranma walked in, and removed his shoes. His host followed suit, before motioning him towards the living room.<p>"Sorry the afternoon turned out to be a bust, Ranma," Nabiki apologised, as she headed for the kitchen.<p>"Ah, no big deal, I guess," Ranma replied, sitting himself on the living room floor. He huffed a breath, before looking around to see if there was anything interesting to do. He wasn't interested in playing the videogame systems at the moment, nor was he really ever at any time. He never understood the appeal of watching TV; sitting still like that always made him antsy, and kept him from ever concentrating on the shows.<p>He was no longer interested in going out anywhere, he had already been out, even if it was for a few hours. Since the sparring session was cut short, he still had a great deal of energy to spend, and debated going out to practice, until Nabiki returned with two tall glasses with carbonated murky light brown liquid on crushed ice.<p>"Here you go, dear," Nabiki handed the one that was the lightest shade of the two to Ranma, before sitting herself on the couch.<p>"What's this?"<p>"Don't get your hopes up, Ranma," Nabiki replied with a chuckle, "It's just a French soda; tonic water, vanilla syrup, and Irish cream... well, mine also has Vermouth and Brandy, but you don't need to worry about that."<p>Not that Ranma really cared for alcohol, but he was felt a bit put off, "You let me drink before..."<p>"And I also said we wouldn't make it a habit," Nabiki replied in a somewhat serious voice. She took a sip of her drink, and leaned back on the couch, "I think today would make a great day just to relax, wouldn't you say?"<p>Ranma shrugged, "Not that I really have anything better to do."<p>Nabiki gave him a playful smile, "That's what makes it so perfect. Come on, the floor isn't nearly as comfortable as up here."<p>Ranma hesitated at the invite, but sighed, and took a place next to her, although ensuring there was at least a couple of feet distance between them. He then finally tested his own beverage, before tilting his head sideways in judgement, and taking another sip, "This ain't bad. Tastes like you put some lemon in it, though."<p>"That's the tonic water," Nabiki replied, a bit crestfallen, "It was all I had at the moment."<p>"It's pretty good, though," Ranma consoled, picking up on her dejection.<p>"Glad you like it," the older woman answered with a more upbeat tone. She set her own drink on the end table, got up, and went to her CD stand. On top, lay a mini-CD that still remained wrapped in it's sealing plastic. "Still haven't gotten a chance to listen to this. Picked it up since I thought most of the stuff I had was a bit too... old..." she twitched slightly at her choice of word, before revising herself, "...mature for your tastes."<p>Ranma wasn't quite sure how to take the 'mature' remark, and decided to take it somewhat negatively, "Actually, I kinda liked some of the stuff you have. It wasn't like I got to listen to much of it when I was training, you know?"<p>"You poor, deprived dear," Nabiki cooed, before putting putting the CD into the player stack. She picked up the remote control, before returning to the couch, next to Ranma. "I guess we have plenty of time to rectify that, don't we?"<p>"At least until we find my old man," Ranma grumbled, sourly, "Still any luck?"<p>Nabiki blinked a couple of times, before realizing that there *was* something she was supposed to be doing the whole time Ranma had been staying with her, "Ah... nothing's turned up on them, but they can't hide for long..."<p>"Heh, you don't know my Pops," Ranma returned, sighing in resignation. Ranma noticed the song being played, "What is this?"<p>"It was suggested to me when I was running errands a couple of days ago," Nabiki replied, snuggling against Ranma. The pigtailed boy started, having not realized that Nabiki placed herself closer to him when she had returned. "Was told that this single's been pretty big, and I'm not impartial to trying out new things. It also had the added bonus of falling into your generalage group."<p>The pigtailed martial artist didn't pay much attention to what Nabiki was saying, as he was battling a spontanious case of nerves. Fighting down the anxiety, Ranma took several gulps of his drink, and focused himself on something that would offset the rather pleasant feeling Nabiki's body against his side, "Doesn't sound bad at all. At least it isn't some rediculously cute girl who can't sing worth crap."<p>"You won't find any of those in my collection," Nabiki said, sternly, before suddenly shifting, and laying her head on Ranma's lap.<p>"HEY!"<p>"Oh hush, you're comfortable, alright?" Nabiki retorted, before pointing to her drink, "Hand me that, will you?"<p>Trying his best not to disturb Nabiki, Ranma reached over, and grabbed her drink for her. "Anything else, your majesty?" he asked, with notable sarcasm in his voice.<p>"Just mistress will do," Nabiki answered jokingly, sitting up a bit to take a good few gulps, before handing it back to Ranma. He held it for a few seconds, before staring at Nabiki in confusion.<p>"Put it back on the table, genius."<p>"Oh," Ranma did as he was told, and took a long drink from his own before setting it to join Nabiki's. At a loss for anything else to say or do, Ranma simply relaxed back into the couch.<p>"Glad you're enjoying the music."<p>"What you mea-," It was then Ranma noticed himself tapping his foot to the song, which was causing Nabiki's head to bounce slightly. "Ah, sorry."<p>"Don't stop on my account," Nabiki quickly stated, "As long as you're keeping in beat, it's not a problem." And she was enjoying the soft dribbling sensation, so she wasn't going to complain.<p>"Well, you know how it is about the art, us martial artists have to have rhythm," Ranma commented nonchilantly.<p>Nabiki tilted her head up to look at Ranma, favoring him with a sly smile, "Why, that almost sounded like innuendo, you dirty little boy!"<p>"Huh?"<p>Nabiki pouted, when her light teasing obviously went over his head, and sighed, "You know? I really can't think of anything better to do, right now."<p>"Um, Nabiki... are you really comfortable with this?" Ranma asked, suddenly finding the position they were in a little too intimate for his liking.<p>"Don't think about it too much, Ranma," Nabiki replied, "Last time I did this was with Jesse." Nabiki chuckled at the recollection, "I had the nastiest hangover that... that night..."<p>"Oh," Ranma answered, feeling a bit dejected at Nabiki's explanation. "Hmm? What's up?"<p>"Nothing," Nabiki replied, somberly, pushing the memory out of her head and cataloging it as one of those 'episodes' in her life.<p>"I guess Ms. Summers is a pretty good friend, huh?" Ranma enquired, not realizing that Nabiki wanted to drop the conversation.<p>"Well, she usually is... how did you know her family name?" Just ask the question left Nabiki's lips, she figured it out.<p>"That's who I got those chocolates from"/"That's who you got those chocolates from," they both stated, in unison. Of course, it wasn't easy to come by the American brand in Japan, and Ranma gave her two boxes, no less. It was probably all Jesse's idea in the first place, which darkened Nabiki's mood.<p>"Why, that meddling... when did you meet her, Ranma?" Nabiki looked directly into Ranma's eyes, studying them to ensure he wasn't lying.<p>The pigtailed boy seemed oblivious to the scruteny, "I met her when I went to pick them up. Ah... one of those boxes was the one you prepaid for, by the way. You know? I just thought about it, didn't actually realize that you two were friends."<p>"That will be debatable, if she doesn't have a plausable answer for butting into my relationship life like this." It wasn't like it was unexpected, since the woman made it her personal hobby to set Nabiki up with one guy or another, and even vowed with Shampoo and Nodoka that they wouldn't rest until they saw Ranma and her together. But, Nabiki would have thought the American woman would have given up the idea once she saw Ranma, and realized exactly how young he was.<p>"Um... ah..."<p>Nabiki realized Ranma was suddenly becoming increasingly nervous, and back-tracked what she had said, "Take it with a grain of salt, Ranma. We're just friends."<p>"Oh. That's... that's cool, then," Ranma replied, calming down, but feeling a slight pang at that acknowledgement. he reached over for his soda, and attempted to wash the sensation down.
