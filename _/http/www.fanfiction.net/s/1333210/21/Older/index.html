</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki groaned, irritated to awakening in such discomfort. The cold stone under her could be felt through the damp, thin shirt she wore, as she adjusted her cramped legs from their cumbersome position that kept them from hanging over the edge of the natural platform she was on. One of her arms felt numb from the restriction of bloodflow to it.<p>The sounds of water gently crashing against the wall of earth behind her caused her to stir further. The smell of fine salt whifted in her nose, as she turned her head up to catch a cool subtle spray of ocean mist to her face. Her eyes met with the early dawn, the sun not even barely peaked from the horizon yet, leaving the sky a nearly undisturbed gray that was soothing in its simplicity. She almost sat up fully, ready to shake the feeling back into her left arm, as she wondered what she was doing on a rock in the middle of the bay. Just as she was about to shake her arm, she realized someone was laying on it.<p>Ranma. Nabiki looked down at the still sleeping redhead, looking at all as if she had spent the night in a bed of the softest downs and silks, in the warmth of a gentle fire nearby with a heat that almost lovingly permeated one's being, and not on cold stone with a somewhat chill air to provide a blanket. Nabiki couldn't bring herself to wake Ranma, as the girl's head rested on her arm. She turned over, suddenly pressing her face into Nabiki's chest, snuggling in closer to the woman. The woman she had finally convinced of the sincerity of her love.<p>Nabiki couldn't possibly deny it any longer, or deny Ranma. If she did, she was sure she would be hurting Ranma far worse than any training mishap or battle, far worse than her father, her mother's unthinking demand for manliness, or anything else could. Nabiki knew that she also would be damned if she denied Ranma any small happiness she could grant her, but silently prayed that she wasn't making an even bigger mistake by doing so.<p>It was a painful realization last night, to finally understand the extent of Ranma's love, to comprehend how much Ranma now depended on her for her emotional state and spiritual welfare. Nabiki's opinion mattered to Ranma in nearly an obsessive degree, and the more Nabiki thought about it, the more she realized that Ranma did indeed curry for her favor almost since they had first met. Any disagreement he attempted to blow off, while possibly finding a way, at least subconciously, to let her know how much it her him... usually in a manner by hurting her.<p>"When did this relationship truly begin?" Nabiki thought to herself, as she lightly stroked a strand of hair that ran from Ranma's bangs. Even before Ranma demanded her answer on where they stood that stormy night, their interaction had been intimate in many ways. She trusted him, probably more than she trusted anyone else at the time, since she knew, thanks to his endearing innocence, what he was capable of doing. Even most boys his age seemed to lack what she saw in Ranma, probably because of his submersion of the art and his family's artform, as surpisingly, Happosai was adimant in including the code of budo in the teachings of Anything Goes... well, select teachings of budo, at least.<p>Ranma was honest to a fault, even when he attempted to... misdirect the truth. In fact, often too honest and to the point where it was past prudence to simply lie instead of revealing the reality of a situation.<p>Because of this, Ranma couldn't lie, or cheat, or hide his feelings from her, because he simply wasn't capable of doing so to one who wasn't blind. She would hardly say she understood Ranma perfectly, but Nabiki would like to believe that she would know when Ranma attempted to twist the truth, or hid things from her. Nabiki could easily admit that there would be little pain in loving Ranma. Yet...<p>As carefully as she could, Nabiki cradled Ranma into her arms, and leapt to the short cliff that stood against the ocean. Finding a foothold, she leapt from it, and onto the oceanwalk above. There was scarcely anyone there, so Nabiki's appearance went unnoticed. It was past time for them to return to the hotel, and she was already sure there would be some questions coming, and a confrontation to contend with.<p>_<p>Nabiki couldn't be surprised, as she and Ranma walked down the hotel hall, and found Cologne waiting before her room. Nabiki was surprised at the lack of anger the Amazon elder had expressed across her face, as the same for any type of cold or neutral expression. The old woman looked.. resigned, if anything. "Cologne," Nabiki ventured, cautiously, just as the redhead immidiately placed herself between Nabiki and the elderly woman.<p>"You've made things much more complicated, you realize?" Cologne stated, factually.<p>"For you, things seem much simpler from my side," Nabiki returned, not allowing any hautiness to sneak into her tone, regardless of her statement.<p>Cologne nodded, "But, Shampoo must have her husband, or the head of the girl that stands between us... in more ways than one," Cologne stated, speaking metaphorically on Ranma's position, "and we both do not want the latter to come to pass."<p>"No, I doubt either of us would," Nabiki stated in a firm manner, before stepping up closer to Ranma's back, and wrapping her arms around Ranma from behind, "But, as you can probably guess, Ranma's made his choice, and I would be damned if I let you attempt to take that from him." Nabiki narrowed her eyes, intending to ensure her threat got through, "And I promise, so dearly, that I will do anything in my power to make sure you are unable to do so." Wether it was that she was emotionally drained, physically tired, or possibly even the coctail of femenine hormones that coarsed through Ranma's body at the moment,but at Nabiki's declaration, the redhead felt herself simply go week. Instead of slumping to the floor, she relaxed against Nabiki, who simply tightened her arms around the girl to give her support.<p>Cologne simply continued to stare at Nabiki with a stoic expression, but did not speak since she suspected the middle-aged woman had more to say. Indeed Nabiki did, as her features relaxed to pleading, "Please, I wouldn't want things to come to that. and deities know that I wouldn't dream of hurting Shampoo, either."<p>"Then it's the Fates we should blame for this situation, for hard decisions will await us all." Cologne said, tiredly. "Get some rest, you two, I can only surmise it's needed, considering how long the two of you were out." With that, Cologne headed to her own room.<p>Ranma continued to stare at the old woman, expecting some sort of attack. The feeling of Nabiki's chin suddenly resting on her head caused her to relax a bit. "Go on ahead to bed, Ranma," Nabiki suggested, "I'll wake you up at noon." The redhead hesitated, but nodded, and walked to the room she was currently sharing with Happosai.<p>Once Ranma entered her own room, Nabiki dropped her front, and braced her hand against the nearby wall. Truth was, she was scared. She doubted physical harm would come unless the last possible option, but even as upset as Cologne seemed, the old woman still radiated confidence that the situation could still be recovered in her favor. Nabiki was in no way naive that the woman was clever, and her belief was most likely justified. Worse yet, Nabiki considered every viable option Cologne had available, but saw none that Nabiki couldn't easily thwart. That was bad, since that meant that there was just something Nabiki was missing completely.<p>The only thing to do was wait for the shoe to drop. The ball was on Cologne's field, though Nabiki and Ranma would be providing strong defense. Shaking out the stream of inane metaphors from her head, the middle aged woman entered her room.<p>She saw Shampoo still laying in bed, but the girl opened her eyes as soon a she heard the door close. "Good morning" Shampoo greeted calmly, sitting up from bed.<p>Nabiki went to her own bed, and sat down, "Good morning." Nabiki wasn't sure what to expect from Shampoo, so she decided to remain just as guarded as she did with Cologne.<p>"You find Ranma?" Shampoo asked, though from her tone, she seemed as if she were just wanting confirmation than an answer.<p>Nabiki nodded, finding no reason to lie, "Yeah, I found him." Nabiki started to remove her shirt, "I expected you to be right behind me."<p>"Demon Letch interfere," Shampoo said, surprisingly lacking any anger, "I began to track you when we get my top back."<p>Nabiki nodded, figuring out what happened, "You tracked Ranma all the way from China, how come you still didn't find us? We were gone all night."<p>"Great Grandmother ask me the same question," Shampoo responded, getting out of bed, "I did trace you, until one point. Nobody see where you go, and hard to trail on concrete."<p>"I see," Nabiki replied, deciding the answer was true, "I'm going to get me a few more hours of sleep." Nabiki cut the conversation as short as possible, not wanting to have to answer any questions on what may have happened last night. They were gone a long while, after all.<p>Shampoo nodded, "I shall go out to practice, then." Shampoo got up to start her morning routine, smiling slightly at the memory of seeing Ranma in Nabiki's arms, as they remained secluded at the base of the cliff.<p>_<p>Cologne may have prepared the cup of tea in her hands, but she refused to drink the vile stuff. Even for such a posh hotel, they afforded only second rate green tea for their guests. The Amazon elder would have found this highly insulting, if she didn't have other things on her mind. If not for that insidious pervert's unwitting interferance, Cologne would not have to up the ante so soon. If she were able to give the geriatric idiot any credit, she would insist that Happosai was interfering intentionally.<p>Shampoo entered, using the key she had swiped from Nabiki while she was gone overnight. She knew her elder would be calling for her shortly, and decided she need not wait and stew in anxiety like a prattling child awaiting punishment for completely trivial matters. Cologne looked over at the girl, not much surprised to see her.<p>"{It does you credit that you took the initiative. It is the sign of one who deinged for greatness.}"<p>Cologne was speaking in their native tongue. Shampoo need not that sign to know this was serious, "{I am honored by your words, Great Elder.}" Shampoo bowed low at the waist, remaining proud yet still formal.<p>Cologne immidiately broke off formalities, "{I need not tell you that this can no longer go on as it had.}" Cologne didn't wait for Shampoo to answer, "{I had turned a blind eye towards your less than convincing charades. This is a luxury I will not allow any further. If I do not believe you... capable of handling this on your own merit, I will have no choice but to respond to this as a threat... do I make myself clear?"<p>Shampoo's eyes widened slightly. She had expected her Great-Grandmother to take drastic measures, but this...<p>"{Understood, Elder. I will not challenge the wisdom of your decision.}"<p>"{You're damn right you will not! You have already taken advantage of my leniency,}" Cologne snapped, "{and because of this, your standing is challenged.}"<p>Shampoo fought to keep the emotion from affecting her, as she nodded, "{u-understood... Great Elder}"<p>Cologne nodded in approval, "leave me now, girl, there is much I must contemplate on." Shampoo left without a word, not wanting to attract the Amazon Elder's further ire.<p>_<p>Ranma wouldn't admit it, but he was infinitely glad that this vacation was over. Ever since that night, Shampoo had become much more aggressive. He never again had a moment alone with Nabiki, no matter how hard he, or she, tried. Even with Happosai's antics, surpisingly targeting the Amazons, it wasn't enough to keep them from dogging their trail.<p>Also, Shampoo had gotten bolder, MUCH bolder. One incident even had him running in near blind panic from Nabiki's room, when Shampoo strolled through the room, missing a few articles of clothing (for instance... all of them).<p>Of course, that spurred an all not *too* unwanted catalyst, as the beet red young man kept his eyes downcast, as Nabiki walked out of his bathroom, still drying her hair, as she walked over to the bed to retrive her bra to replace the towel that was precariously draped around her neck and covering her endowments. She thought enough to bring her panties in with her when she used his shower, why did that slip her mind?<p>"Thanks for letting me use your shower while Shampoo was using ours," Nabiki stated, while bending over... away from Ranma, while strapping on her bra a bit longer than she probably needed to.<p>"Ah, would you rather me leave the room?" Ranma enquired, only brave enough to sneak glances when he was sure Nabiki wasn't looking. Now, he knew, a REAL gentleman would have left the room without enquiry...<p>Nabiki looked over her shoulder, and glared slightly at Ranma when she noticed he was trying his hardest to keep his eyes directed elsewhere, "That's alright, Ranma, I'm almost done anyways, and I didn't want to kick you out of your own room."<p>"You threw Happosai out right on the spot," Ranma supplied.<p>Nabiki remained undaunted, "Besides which, it isn't like you've seen me in my underwear before," she commented, as she slipped her tanktop on.<p>"Yeah, but still..." Ranma mumbled, weakly.<p>"That's sweet of you, Ranma," Nabiki replied, padding over to Ranma, and rewarding him with a kiss on the cheek, before leaning back, "But it isn't like I don't MIND you seeing me in my underwear..."<p>"...or mind if you took advantage of me in this state," Nabiki added silently to herself. She knew better than to speak it out loud, since Shampoo had him spooked something fierce. She had to sigh internally for falling into such an inmature game with Shampoo, but Nabiki really did like Ranma looking at her, feeling his eyes gently caressing the curves she worked hard to maintain at her age, letting her know that she was still attractive, and that the young man she knew without a doubtthat loved her thought of her as sexy. Now, if she could only get him to express it...<p>It was then that something occured to Nabiki, as she grew a mischeivious grin. "Hey, Ranma-hon..."<p>Ranma still had his eyes directed, "Um, yeah?"<p>"It really... really is sweet of you, but it's unnecessary, you realize?"<p>"Uh... I guess," Ranma replied, at a loss for anything really to say. He felt the part of the bed beside him depress, and was forced to turn to look out of curiosity. Nabiki's none-too-subtle and hungry grin complimented her hooded, smoldering eyes that were barely inches from his.<p>"You don't have to guess, Ranma," Nabiki stated, as she placed her other hand on the other side of Ranma's waist, and leaned towards him. Ranma leaned back, intimidated by Nabiki's boldness. The older woman remained insistant, as she captured his lips in immidiate action, causing Ranma to inhale sharply, catching a wiff of her freshly bathed body. Just the scent alone was enough to make the majority of his mind give in. The minority that attempted to remain noble was finding it's stance highly overrated.<p>Alas, Murphy's Law, and Amazon timing, decided to come into play, "Ranma, you see Nabiki around. She can use show-"<p>Both Nabiki and Ranma blinked at Shampoo from their rather damning positions, before slowly separating.<p>"Thanks Shampoo, but it isn't necessary," Nabiki stated, almost hautily.<p>Shampoo refrained from her exasperated sigh, and approached the two of them. Grabbing Ranma by the arm, the young Amazon began to lead him out the room, "Let us go, Ranma. Nabiki needs privacy to dress."<p>"Sure," Ranma readily agreed, grateful for the escape from the tension he was feeling. Nabiki still remained halfway on the bed, blinking on what just happened. One minute she would have made Ranma a stammering wreck after... she estimated thirty minutes, the next minute, she's alone, half-dressed, and way too turned on.<p>Shampoo would have to pay for that.<p>Nabiki sighed, forcably quelling her own desire, and sat on the edge of the bed. Just as well they were interrupted before things had gotten too far. She really should have expected it. Besides which, she virtually dominated Ranma in that moment. True, she doubted he would REALLY mind (particularly after she was done with him) but...<p>"Deities, what am I thinking?" the middle-aged woman chided herself. She was letting this unvoiced competition with Shampoo go to her head. Nabiki had openly staked her claim on Ranma now, and she sincerely had a thing about holding onto what she rightfully entitled as hers. As much as she considered dear Shampoo a friend, she simply wouldn't allow the Amazon, or her Great-Grandmother, to come between her and Ranma.<p>Nabiki put on a pair of tight fitting jeans she had set out for herself (well, set out for Ranma, she was just wearing them for his viewing pleasure), and left the room.<p>_<p>The busride to the airport was just like the hotel stay; trialsome. Nabiki decided out of prudence that it was best to curb any outright displays of affection on Ranma, lest someone voice something that would off-set Ranma. As upset as she would be, she was more concerned for the welfare of anyone bold enough to make a scathing statement. She was pretty sure Ranma wouldn't have that at all.<p>Unfortunately, Ranma still had to 'politely' ask a few guys to keep their commentaries to themselves, while Nabiki and Cologne favored the ladies with their evilest glares. Shampoo didn't seem to have any of Nabiki's inhibitions about public displays of affection, as she came excrutiatingly close to 'shameless'. Ranma himself was pressed with seperating himself from Shampoo, while meeting any comments on Shampoo's nationality, or her brazenness. He may not have liked what Shampoo was doing, but he wasn't about to let her have to deal with idiotic commentary.<p>The plane ride had been marginally better, as Ranma opted to switch seats with an old lady who had been accidentally placed at the emergency exit. Though he wasn't eighteen, Ranma's crumbling of a sodacan into a marble did well enough to prove to the flight attendants that he was capable of exerting fifty pounds of pressure to open the door in case of an emergency.<p>With out the focus of their sudden rivalry between them, Nabiki took the time to chide Shampoo on her behavior, which in turn the girl took as an affront, and replied with no small amount of attitude. Happosai cackling and making cat noises in reference to the two didn't help matters, and Cologne chose wisely to listen to the airline radio station over the headphones she was provided... on full volume.<p>After the 'pleasant' flight, Nabiki saw the prudence in taking two SEPARATE taxis, providing the excuse that Cologne may want to check on her restuarant, rather than return with her and Ranma.<p>Of course, Cologne enquired where Shampoo fit into the equation, to which Nabiki sweetly suggested that she took her Great Granddaughter with her. Cologne pleasantly replied that it may be best if Ranma came with them to the restaurant, assured he was famished and in need of a good meal. Nabiki saw the wisdom in Cologne's words, and stated that Ranma would have something to eat when they arrived home. Ranma then mentioned that they neglected grocery shopping, since they were going to be gone for two weeks, so there was practically no food in the house...<p>Fortunately, the object of the debate was removed from the equation, as Happosai decided he was tired of attempting to behave, splashed Ranma, and scored a free grope or two. Apparently, they weren't as free as he presumed, since Ranma, in quote, was intentful of "Taking it out of your hide, you letcherous freak."<p>Watching the two race through the airport, Nabiki and Shampoo idly thought of how impeccable Happosai's timing was.<p>_<p>Nabiki now stood with her hand on the doorknob, deciding she was just too tired at the moment to bother with her own luggage, much less anyone else's. Once she had a good restup, she would retrieve hers, and be kind enough to retrieve the others from her car. As resting as her vacation with Ranma *should* have been, she was definitely looking forward to her own bed.<p>Almost listlessly slipping her shoes off, Nabiki scuffled towards her room, feeling the weariness settle upon her with each step. She looked into her room, and almost sighed in blissful elation; it was amazing how much you missed home, regardless of where you've been.<p>One undignified bellyflop later, Nabiki's face was buried in her soft pillow, as she lay splayed upon her exorbantly comfortable matress. Yes, this was the sensation of respite she was missing. Maybe it would have been better to stay home instead.<p>No, if that were to have been, she may never have sat upon a lonely island near the shore, discovering how deep the emotions of a certain sex changing love interest ran. Nabiki rolled over, wrapping her arms around her chest, savoring the feelings that ran through her like warm sunshine and fine wine. Ranma loved her, gave his heart to her so openly without shame. Perhaps it was because he was a girl at the time, but the visual symphony of emotions that Ranma had conducted from her heart to the orchestra of her all too innocent and vunerable face was so powerful, so definite that Nabiki could not help but succomb; give in and float upon the turbulant crests of desperation, caring, anxiety, desire, and need.<p>She had to latch onto Ranma, saught the pigtailed martial artist as if she were the eye of the storm that thundered a thousand miles wide. To keep her distance from that center was to be consumed in the raging tempest about the both of them. She had to return Ranma's love, lest they both be destroyed in the storm of Ranma's own creation.<p>Nabiki took Ranma's heart, and knew she was capable of giving hers to him, for she knew Ranma would *never* do anything to harm her, Ranma would *never* deny her. Ranma would *NEVER* betray her trust. Ranma, to sum it all perfectly, was the one Nabiki trusted most now, the one she thought she could lo-<p>Nabiki sat up, hearing the door open. "Hello?"<p>"I'm home, Nabiki," Ranma called out to answer Nabiki's cautious greeting. The sound of his voice filled Nabiki with a vigor she had missed since she was in school. Almost jumping out of bed, she went to meet her paramour. Managing to maintain some of her composure, Nabiki couldn't help but allow her smile to grow, as she saw Ranma walking into the living room, expecting to find her immidiately.<p>"Got tired of chasing Happosai?" the middle-aged woman teased.<p>Ranma snorted, "The old goat gave me the slip almost ten minutes after everyone left." Ranma gave Nabiki an apologetic look, "Sorry I got carried away, but I couldn't let the letch get away with that."<p>Nabiki's smile calmed, yet remained just as warm, "That's okay, Ranma. Grampa saved us a bit of a headache with his intervention, anyways."<p>"You know I was just gonna ride with you, right? There wasn't anything the old ghoul could do about it, either."<p>"I know you would have, Ranma."<p>After Nabiki's calm, but subtly forceful statement, they settled into an ackward silence. Ranma fidgeted, unsure of what to do next, to which Nabiki smiled, and approached the pigtailed boy. Wrapping her arms around his waist, Nabiki tilted her head slightly to the side, and captured the pigtailed boy's lips. Their breaths met in the hollow formed between their joined but parted lips, dancing an invisible ballet as they both exhaled into the kiss, before they inhaled, attempting to share the air between them. The loss of the pocket brought their lips tighter together, now almost tasting more of what the other's scent and being existed of.<p>The intimate contact wasn't like an explosion of passion, but like a single swath of vibrantly glossy burgundy acryllic paint across a felt black canvas; having its on intensity while remaining subdued physically. "That's one place you can start," Nabiki commented in a whisper, after they broke contact, answering Ranma's silent question to himself.<p>Ranma smiled contently, becoming visibly more relaxed. "Thanks... er... thank you." Nabiki nearly giggled at his formalness, understanding that Ranma still had no clue of where to proceed. Once again, she took the initiative, shifting to the side of him, and placing her hand closest to him into the small of his back. Gently, she guided him to the couch, and sat him down before sitting next to him.<p>"Ranma," Nabiki started, making sure to sound every bit as confident as she wanted to be, "I don't want you feeling as if there's something special you have to do everytime we see each other."<p>"Ah..." Ranma started to reply, "but, I kinda do, if it's okay, you know?"<p>With her hand still on his back, Nabiki slowly rubbed circles against his shirt; the pressure massaging the flesh under it. Unconciously, Ranma leaned against her hand, as his body accepted the calming pleasure of Nabiki's touch. "Ranma, that's very sweet of you." the older woman began again, turning to lean her torso against Ranma's shoulder, being careful not to put too much pressure against her own chest. Her other arm went around Ranma's ribs to his other side, and she maneuvered herself for another peck, "but the only thing I truly need from you, is to know that you appreciate me, as much as I do you."<p>Ranma favored Nabiki with a confident smirk that elicited a soft hug from her. "Well, I can promise that isn't going to be an issue."<p>"Words, Mr. Saotome," Nabiki joked, starting to pull away. It was with a slight surprise to her, when the pigtailed boy latched onto her arms, preventing her from further escape.<p>"Is that a challenge?" Ranma enquired, as the side of his mouth twisted slightly for a bigger smile, "You know we gotta answer every challenge issued, it's part of the Anything Goes code..."<p>"Well then, Ranma-hon," Nabiki declared just above a giddy whisper, "I formally challenge you to keep me happy. Starting..." Nabiki leaned back to the side of the couch, bringing Ranma with her, and inviting his weight against her own body. Ranma managed to brace his hands on the sides of the woman's ribs, while she wrapped her arms around his waist tightly, almost in a bear hug, and attempted to pull him closer to her, "...now."<p>Ranma fell effortlessly into the role play, finding it on a similar ground he was more comfortable with. The grin never leaving his face, Ranma responded, "I accept."<p>This time, the pigtailed martial artist took the offensive, as Nabiki yeilded ground. Nabiki moaned into the kiss, feeling quite proud of herself for that little maneuver. Getting Ranma to relax was going to be an issue, she could easily see, but with a little coaxing and nudging, he was more than willing to give in, to drop his guard and anxieties.<p>Nabiki dragged one of her hands down against Ranma's side, tickling him slightly through his shirt, before it drifted to the hem of his pants where the shirt was tucked in. Just as she was about to go further, Ranma tensed up slightly, causing Nabiki some concern when her hand began to slip under his shirt. As much as she wanted right now to tactilly sense Ranma skin over painstakenly toned musculature, she didn't want to make him uncomfortable with this.<p>Fate took the decision from her hands, "Hello, I am home."<p>Nabiki wasn't particularly interested in breaking from Ranma, and was almost angry when Ranma shot off of her, and was standing by the TV and tucking his shirt back in hastefully. Shampoo walked in, her expression subdued as she wasn't even concentrating on anyone. At the expression, regardless of her conduct on their trip, Nabiki's concern shifted from having been Ranma's to the Amazon girl.<p>"Welcome back, Shampoo, stomething wrong?"<p>Shampoo waived the question off, beginning to head up the wire spiral staircase, "Is okay. Shampoo... I just talk with Great Grandmother. Some important business about Neichiizu. Ranma need to tuck his shirt in better, and wipe off Nabiki lip stick."<p>Nabiki would have laughed at the expression on Ranma's face, before he quickly started dragging his , if not for the underlaying seriousness she was sensing from Shampoo. Getting up from the couch, Nabiki went to follow the girl to her room. Just as Shampoo was about to enter, Nabiki spoke, "You sure nothing's wrong? You don't really look the part."<p>Shampoo kept her back turned to Nabiki as she stood within the threshold, but nodded, "I am sure, I thank you for your concern."<p>"This has something to do with the way you started acting on the trip, right?" Nabiki enquired in a soft, but demanding tone that wasn't accusing, but hinted that she already drew a conclusion.<p>Shampoo stood still for several moments, before surprising Nabiki with her answer.<p>"{Yes, my friend. Yes it does}." With that, Shampoo entered her room, and silently closed the door.<p>The way Shampoo had said it, Nabiki could hear the apparent hopelessness in the girl's voice. It was obvious that she was being trapped by her own customs and laws, and what she herself wanted. Shampoo was part of the ill-lasting 'Fiancee Brigade' that had vowed to get Nabiki and Ranma together under any and all circumstances. Shampoo was sincere in her beliefs that the two belonged together, so whatever caused her to suddenly change her position was serious indeed.<p>Nabiki didn't want to see Shampoo hurt, but she felt much more strongly about holding onto Ranma, even if Shampoo truly did decide she wanted him for herself. There once was a time when Nabiki wouldn't have thought twice about what she needed to do, but after years and years of both being and facing the heartless cutthroat, she couldn't find it in her to be so outright callous. When it comes down to the final, Nabiki was sure how she would play things, but when the game was over, she was pretty sure she would lose her a friend that had become rather close to her, regardless of age. Damn that old woman, and her asinine, outdated laws.<p>Quietly, Nabiki walked back down the stairs, finding Ranma standing at the base of them with a concerned face, "Well?"<p>Nabiki simply shrugged, "I don't know, Ranma-hon, I don't know."<p>_<p>_<p>_<p>Author's notes (WTF?): yeah, I know I cheezed in the middle section, and this chapter is rediculously short compared to the others. But Damn it, I got Project Gotham 2 Racing for the XBox with an XBox LIVE account! Surely you understand that my time's tied up ^^; (BTW, Gamer tag on LIVE's WFROSE for anyone that cares)<p>Boy, you guys going to be upset when Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix comes out beginning of December...
