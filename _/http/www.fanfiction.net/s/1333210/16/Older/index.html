</div>'Older'<p>Nodoka tended to the small garden in front of her home, content with the therapeutic toiling and passage of time. She didn't get a chance to talk with Nabiki last night, and from what she had gotten from Shampoo, this current perdicerment would be hard to rectify.<p>The young Amazon apologised for her hand in things, but Nodoka well understood; her hands had been tied, and hesitation would have proven even moreso problmatic in the long run.<p>As it was now, the Saotome Matriarch didn't consider it more than a vicious spat between her son and his fiancee, so it wouldn't be something that couldn't be handled, given the correct treatment. She internally sighed at how high maintance Nabiki could be for someone with such a laid back contenance. It was painfully apparent Ranma didn't have the necessary expertise to contend with much she presented him with (curse you for your lack of foresight, Genma), so it would require a mother's touch to carefully mend the situation.<p>Checking her watch, Nodoka's expression fell slightly. Nabiki would have only gotten to work an hour or so ago, and the redheaded woman was very eager to get to fixing things. With very little to do on many days, meddling in the lives of those around you proved to be an exellent recreation.<p>At the sound of a car horn, a curious Nodoka rose from the garden bed, dusting the dry soil from her jeans. She walked through the fence that surrounded her house, and turned to look down the street. She was rather surprised to find Nabiki standing outside her BMW, parked on the sidewalk, staring back at her.<p>The sun had been mild this morning with the thin cloud cover, hardly warrenting the aviator's sunglasses Nabiki wore. Even with the facial barrier, Nodoka could easily read the expression of helplessness that Nabiki was attempting to disguise behind a parody of her usual calm demeanor.<p>"Mrs. Saotome," Nabiki started, her words sounding strained and measured, "We need to talk."<p>"Oh, hello, Nabiki, I was hoping we would have the opportunity to do so," Nodoka replied in greeting, "Shouldn't you be at work? It is still rather early in the morning."<p>"I called in, they know I won't be in today," Nabiki stated in a very factual tone. She looked Nodoka over, and decided she didn't want to have the interior of her car soiled, "You have a moment to go change?"<p>_<p>"I noticed you were rather distressed last night," Nodoka began, since Nabiki had remained quiet since they started the drive.<p>"Mrs. Saotome, I think it's long about time you took Ranma back home."<p>Nodoka wasn't quite expecting such a reply, "But, I wouldn't want to take my son away from his future-"<p>"Don't start this shit with me, Nodoka." Still, almost in a flat tone that disguised her emotions, allowing only the words to emphesize her fustration, "I won't be getting married, least of all to your son."<p>"I understand if you're having some reservations-"<p>"WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?" Nabiki shouted, taking her eyes from the road for a moment. She forced herself calm, yet it was far too late, as Nodoka realised how bad things possibly were.<p>At this time, the Saotome Matriarch realized that the games were over. "Nabiki... perhaps if we stopped somewhere to talk. There's a lovely park not too far from here."<p>"I'm not going to have much more to say," Nabiki stated solumnly, "Will you take Ranma tonight, or what?"<p>"I shall not answer that question until we've stopped," Nodoka replied with a steely cool, but demanding voice. Nabiki shifted her eyes to glance at the other woman, far from impressed at the redhead's sudden change of demeanor.<p>"Fine, where is this damn park of yours? It better have somewhere close by to park."<p>"There's a pay garage down the block from it. I'll cover the fee if necessary. Just turn left at the next street, head down four blocks, and then right."<p>Neither cared to speak anymore until they were out of the vehicle, and walking through the paved roads of the small concrete park. Around them, the sounds of younger men amidst a game of basketball, children playing on nearby seating benches, and various conversations between other pedestrians broke the silence between the two women who were associated with one another by one strong link.<p>Taking the initiative, Nodoka began, "I understand something happened between you and my son last night."<p>"He's overstayed his welcome. I'm afraid if I'm going to get back on with my life, he's going to have to go."<p>"So he's to blame for your stagnate love life?"<p>That comment hurt worse than any careless ones thrown by Ranma. "That was uncalled for," Nabiki warned, "Nor is it any of your damn business."<p>"My son's business *is* my business," Nodoka countered sharply.<p>"By tonight, your son shouldn't have anything to do with me, once we come to an agreement."<p>"You know? The very reason I had visited last night was because your sister called, asking for me to take Ranma off your hands. I intended to enquire as to the reason for this, and it will not happen until one is supplied."<p>"He just can't live with me anymore," Nabiki said quietly, "I can't keep on taking care of him like he... like he's my son."<p>"Tendou, you are not fooling me. We both know it isn't like a son that you see Ranma as." Nodoka stopped, and fully faced Nabiki, "He deserves someone like you, and you want someone like him. Regardless of age, from what I've seen, the two of you compliment each other."<p>Nabiki slowly shook her head, "And how did you figure that line of bull?"<p>"By having two eyes that work. Perhaps the only way you shall ever see it is through a mirror, since you're obviously unable to look upon yourself."<p>"I don't need to 'see' myself to know how I feel about this," Nabiki proclaimed, "Ever since everyone started pushing us together; from my family, to you, to Shampoo, to Jesse, all I've felt was... was... I've felt disgusted by the whole thing! And you're also willing to do this to your own son? What kind of woman are you?"<p>"A woman that understands the fates do not play even games," Nodoka returned, "A woman who understands that under the best efforts, you cannot help who you fall in love with."<p>"WOULD YOU QUIT IT WITH THAT CRAP!" Nabiki shouted, drawing the attention of many in the park, "I am not in love with Ranma!"<p>"Tsk, tsk, what type of woman denies her own heart so?" Nodoka chided, knowing full well she was winning this battle. All she simply had to do was make Nabiki realise that surrender was the only option left.<p>"How about I tell you what type of woman *you* are," Nabiki countered in a low, dangerous voice, "The type of woman that abandons her son to an amoral man for ten years so he can do shit to him like throw him into a pit of starving cats, or pelt him with darts until he was capable of evading them with no effort. A woman so far out of touch with reality that she has delusions of being a mother-in-law to a woman two years older than her. A woman who used to come around like a lost little puppy looking for attention, because she probably has no friends... oh, and a woman that couldn't even manage her own funds."<p>Nodoka's expression fell into a dangerously angered one, "Careful, Ms. Tendou, I will place blame of your attitude to duress, but my patience is finite."<p>"I guess I should take that threat seriously, after all, you were the one willing to kill her own son."<p>Nodoka's eyes narrowed to slits, "Do not worry about returning me home. I have errands to run."<p>"I'm dropping Ranma off tonight!" Nabiki declared.<p>"You do, and the consequences between our two families would be dire."<p>"What?"<p>Nodoka turned back to Nabiki, now over five yards away, "My husband and yours made this agreement as a matter of honor. I won't simply take Ranma back, because I am honorbound to obey my husband. If you attempt to breach your obligation... what happens next will be your doing."<p>"WHAT TYPE OF ARCHAIC LOAD OF SHIT IS THIS?" Nabiki demanded, thunderstruck from Nodoka's threat.<p>"And if you somehow manage to convince my son on the matter, I will have no recourse other than to declare him unmanly. Do you think your concience can handle such a gambit?"<p>Nabiki stopped cold, recalling one small detail that would place Ranma in jeapordy if he were to return to his mother in the first place. "D-Damn you... Nodoka."<p>"Those are my terms, if you feel it still necessary to simply abandon my son to the fates, know that the fates will take you as a bonus. Good day, Nabiki Tendou." With that, Nodoka turned away, and carried herself from the other woman in wide, speedy, and controlled strides.<p>"God DAMN IT!" Nabiki shouted, throwing her glasses from her face. "What the hell is WRONG with that woman?"<p>_<p>Nodoka rushed into her home, almost in tears. Why did it have to come to this? How did the conversation get so out of control? It was a painful choice Nodoka made, but she made the only obvious one she could. All of them would be hurt if she had just simply gave in, and just because Nabiki was becoming uncomfortable with things, it wasn't necessary for her to go off like she did.<p>Nodoka saw a good friend within Nabiki. A friend that she wanted to have so many years ago, but feared the curse of business with pleasure. Every since she had married Genma, Nodoka had found herself lonlier than before. The man was capable of being a good companion, but he was often aloof, and he expected Nodoka to hold the same traditional values he would always proclaim. As she followed those somewhat archaic ideals, she found herself becoming left behind by aquaintances that had adopted more modern and western notions. Nodoka had but a select few friends that she talked to, because they held the same things in regard and the same notions as she did. They didn't feel a conflict of views with them, thus didn't feel threatened around them.<p>Then came the day Genma proclaimed his and their son's training trip. Just his announcement nearly tore her apart, it was as if Genma didn't care about her at all, even if she intellectually knew that to be false. But, to take her child away, she couldn't allow that. Her demands proved impotent, as she knew ultimately, she would have to obey her husband's word. It was what a proper traditional wife did.<p>Fortunately, Genma offered her consolation. If Ranma wasn't to return a man among men, a man that his own mother would look upon in awe, they would end the Saotome line. Nodoka latched onto this ultimatum, hoping that her seriousness would force Genma to renounce such foolishness, and stay with her. Unfortunately, Genma rarely recognized his own foolishness.<p>Being the proper Japanese woman hurt her too much. She was unintentionally ostricised by friends, she missed out on her son's childhood, and yearned for the touch of her lifelong companion for ten long years. But the only thing she could do was endure, as it was the only way she knew how to live.<p>Before Genma had left, Nodoka had met Nabiki. A woman well adapted to modern times that warmly accepted everyone, regardless of their traditions, beliefs, or nationality. When Nodoka decided in desperation that she needed help, and approached the business woman, she found someone who would not ostricise her, who would not turn her away because they didn't see eye to eye. Unfortunately, the Saotome Matriarch had a more than passing suspicion that Nabiki's warm contenance was little more than her selling tactic. It was part of her business to make sure people trusted her.<p>Because of that, Nodoka had always kept a formal, but still companionable distance from the woman. This only made her realize how lonly she truly was; to want to be so close to someone who has the professional courtesy to be kind to you.<p>Later, she was reunited with Nabiki, and given a better opportunity to be associated with her. Genma, in an act of mixed blessings, had engaged Nabiki to Nodoka's son. At first, Nodoka could only see the humor in the whole ordeal, even if she were to comply with her husbands wishes... that was until she could actually get ahold of him and convince him to drop such foolishness. What came before that time could, was Nodoka's observation. It was beyond the two's notice, but looking in, there was a keen sense of comfort with one another, two pieces from totally separate puzzles that fit perfectly with each other to form a different, yet beautiful and vibrant image all its own. Even if the subtle, yet overbearing demands of society proclaimed that their match was not ethical, to oblige those demands would be a crime to another set of ethics.<p>Nodoka saw this as the ultimate show of Nabiki's independance from the bindings of tradition, social compliance, and expectations. She was falling for her son; a thirty-seven year old woman was becoming attracted to a sixteen year old boy. It simply wasn't done, but Nabiki made it seem so natural, so proper, like to verge from such a course would be a violation of things. Even if Nabiki voiced her reservations, they were easily counteracted by her actions. Words were impotent before action.<p>Much to Nodoka's disappointment, even Nabiki wasn't infallible to. She denied her own heart, because of how things would look to others. She fought to push Ranma away, finally accumilating in the attempt to hoist him off onto his mother.<p>Sitting on her couch, Nodoka put her head into her hands. Having to choose between friendship, and the potential happiness of the two wasn't something she wanted to do, but she ultimately knew what one had to be made. Hopefully, Nodoka wouldn't have to suffer her heart too long.<p>_<p>Nabiki returned home, stumbling in with a weary gait. The confrontation with Nodoka took a lot out of her, and she hadn't even gotten anything out of the ordeal exept threats that she wasn't too positive to be idle ones.<p>Just as well, Nabiki thought. She hadn't actually thought the idea through anyhow. She wanted Ranma gone, but never in such a final way.<p>She greatly disliked the feeling of being trapped, and saught to take her mind off of it. She went to the living room, running a list of movies through her head that whe could be in the mood to watch. She passed by the end table, finding a few envelopes of mail from yesterday set upon it. She picked them up, taking them to her home office, and set them on the desk by the computer. As she did so, she noticed the blinking light on her answering machine, announcing she had messages.<p>"[Um, hello? This is Ibuki Kamijyo... I'm Ranma's class president. I wanted to make sure he was okay... and if I could find out where you live so that I can bring his homework to him? Ah...oh yeah, my phone number...]"<p>Nabiki barely paid attention to the number being read out, fairly sure it was just an excuse to come visit Ranma. Of course, the boy was probably a stud in the classroom. Probably had dozens of young girls all hot and bothered over him. He probably already had a few of them, in fact.<p>Nabiki pushed that thought out of her head, knowing full well that Ranma wouldn't take the opportunity. That call did provide her with one question, though. Where did Ranma go, if he didn't go to school?<p>"Great," Nabiki mumbled to herself out loud, "Maybe I can have him taken off my hands for neglect or something." Just another problem to add to the building pile, she supposed. If Nodoka was going to refuse to claim responsibility for Ranma, then why was she still holding onto him? He had expressed his desire to go trailhunting for their parents, and...<p>Nabiki sighed, she wasn't going to let him do that, she couldn't let him do that. Wasn't she supposed to be relaxing? She had called into work just so she could have a day to unwind, and get her bearings straight. There were more than a few good movies she could indulge in...<p>_<p>Ranma could hear the TV going below the roof. Nabiki was obviously inside, though he knew she was supposed to be at work now. Her running off earlier that morning... hurt. It was a type of pain he didn't know how to deal with, and even after running, it followed him relentlessly.<p>He had spent the day wandering the rooftops, as if an answer to his dilemma would present itself to him out of the blue. As much for his wishful thinking, it was a lost effort.<p>Did she hate him? Was she suddenly tired of him around? It infuriated him not to know what was going on with her, yet he was too scar-... too cautious to confront her about it. She tended to push him away during their spats, but this time, she shoved him. This time she gave him a message that his help wasn't wanted, needed, or appreciated.<p>He wasn't going to believe that crap. He was going to be there for Nabiki, regardless of what she demanded. With newfound courage, Ranma finally leapt from the roof of the house, and walked towards the door.<p>He reached for the door handle, and hesitated. Exactly what was he going to do? Simply demand she tell him what the problem was? If she refused, what then? Beat the answer out of her?<p>He had absolutely no idea how to approach this. Without confrontation, he felt what it was like to be defeated. It was a battle he was far too ill equiped for, in a war he had no business partaking in.<p>He closed his eyes, and lowered his hand. Ranma took slow steps backwards, retreating from the door, before finally turning away, and running.<p>Shampoo landed in Nabiki's driveway, just in time to see the pigtailed boy leap onto a rooftop, and beyond it. She considered following after him, as she had seen his apprehension to enter when Nabiki was there. Instead, she knew she would probably get the most information on things from Nabiki, and it would probably be best to at least hear what she had to say before attempting to rectify the situation. With that, she opened the door, and announced her presence.<p>"Hello Nabiki, Shamp... I am returned!"<p>"That's 'I *have* returned', Shampoo," Nabiki curtly corrected over the living room speakers. Shampoo's eyebrows raised to the top of her forehead, a bit taken back by the hostility that was just presented.<p>"Is, everything okay? Ranma just run off, look too, too upset."<p>Nabiki was startled at the news that Ranma had been nearby, but refused to let it show. "I see."<p>Shampoo bit her bottom lip, as she could see Nabiki was going to be extremely tight-lipped. "He do too, too stupid things again?"<p>"Yes, yes he did, now can we drop it? I'm trying to watch a movie, here..."<p>Shampoo walked into the living room, and watched what was on the TV, "Is this not movie Nabiki say too, too horrible? You say use only as extra coaster when have guests..."<p>"I thought I'd re-evaluate my opinion," Nabiki retorted, not turning her eyes away from the screen.<p>Shampoo sighed, before walking to the end table, and implementing one of mankind's greatest inventions...<p>"Hey!" Nabiki shouted, as Shampoo turned the TV off with the remote control.<p>Shampoo walked around the couch, and sat next to Nabiki, "What happened in morning? I find alarm too, too loud, back door open, Ranma gone, and Nabiki hiding in room."<p>"I wasn't hiding, I was sleeping about that time, in case you hadn't considered it," Nabiki countered, not thinking about how obvious a lie it sounded.<p>"Nabiki then sleepwalk," Shampoo replied, wryly, before giving Nabiki a concerned look, "It no Ranma fault, is it?"<p>"Look, why are you so interested in me and Ranma's affairs?" Nabiki asked, tersely, "What happens between me and Ranma is *our* business, no yours, not Nodoka's, and not Kasumi's!"<p>Shampoo blinked, "You and Ranma have affair?"<p>Nabiki threw her arms up in disgust, "Fine, how about I make this more comprehendable for you?"<p>Shampoo rolled her eyes, "I was only joking, I was well aware of what you meant?"<p>"If you hadn't noticed, I'm not particularly in a joking mood."<p>Shampoo nodded, and decided to remain serious, "Nabiki, perhaps the reason everyone is so intrigued about the goings on between you and Ranma, is because we genuinely want to see the two of you, happy and together?"<p>"That's just it!" Nabiki shouted, switching back to Japanese, "We could *never* be happy together!"<p>"Why you think that?" Shampoo enquired in a tone that said she already knew the coming answer, "You no care for Ranma?"<p>"No, I do NOT care for him!" Nabiki returned, aiming to kill the conversation as quick as possible.<p>"Then why you let him stay in home?" Shampoo asked calmly, remaining unflustered by the older woman's outburst. When Nabiki attempted to remain silent, Shampoo coaxed her, "Hmm?"<p>"It... it was a family obligation," Nabiki replied, quietly.<p>"And you take care of Ranma, be too, too nice to him, is family obligation, too?"<p>"Alright!" Nabiki stood up from the couch, and turned to face Shampoo, "So I do care about him! He's a friend, are you happy?"<p>"And from friendships grows the strongest binds for love," Shampoo replied, gently, "Amazon sisters, future brides and grooms, they-"<p>"Shampoo, I'm not a lesbian, I'm not interested in getting married, and I most certainly am not interested in becoming intimate with a sixteen year old boy!"<p>"Yet, you are in love with him, that much is obvious."<p>"NO, I am NOT in love with RANMA!"<p>"You are roaring like a tiger with it's foot caught in a trap," Shampoo commented, as she came to standing, "Or as it was said..." Shampoo switched to English, "{Thou dost protest too much}"<p>"You have anymore nonsense to throw at me?" Nabiki enquired in an arctic cold voice.<p>"It's only nonsense to those who refuse to understand it. If they ignore it, it confuses the mind as it demands to be considered. Let your heart be the interperator for this, because it will speak the most fluidly."<p>"And when world upside down, chin up," Nabiki replied, rolling her eyes, "As fun apparently for you as this philosophical debate is, it's getting us nowhere. So might I suggest you drop the subject, and go on to whatever you were intending to do?"<p>Shampoo shook her head, sadly, "I had great admiration for you, but I refuse to look up to a fool shouting from the cliffs." Shampoo got up from the couch, and headed to her room, before she fully departed, she turned to Nabiki, "Nabiki, time short. Admit to youself at least, before everything go wrong."<p>Nabiki turned away, and mumbled to herself, "Everything's already gone wrong..."<p>_<p>"Welcome to the Cat Cafe." Ku Shui announced, before recognizing the young man before him, "Oh? Hello! I believe you are a friend of my daughter's?"<p>Ranma shrugged. as he walked into the virtually empty restaurant, "Ah, I guess you could say that. She's staying with Nabiki, too."<p>"As I have been informed," the man replied in an almost lyrical, subtle baratone and cultured voice, before grabbing a menu from the stand, "Come, sit down, I'll be back momentarily for your order, but do take your time."<p>Ranma was sitting down, before remembering his reason for his visit. "Wait! I... ah, actually came to ask about that job the old ghoul offered me last night."<p>"Hmm hmm hmm, be fortunate my Grandmother is out on errands, for if she heard you refer to her as such, the reaction would be most unpleasant." Mr. Xian replied, before handing Ranma the menu, "As such, I am afraid that I cannot speak on her behalf for your employment. But I wish not to make this trip in vain for you. Please, make a decision, and worry not about the cost."<p>At the idea of free food, Ranma's mood lightened slightly, "Hey, thanks! Ah... I'll take the pork and mushroom ramen in ginger and lemongrass broth."<p>"Ah, a quick and exellent selection," the chef congradulated, as he took the menu, "Please, allow me a moment to begin at least boiling the water. As you can see, we have yet to fully garner a thriving business, as they tend to take time."<p>Ranma nodded, as the man went off to begin the meal. Once he was gone, Ranma once again attempted to think of what to do with Nabiki. Unfortunately, it just seemed like a hopeless situation. It was beyond fustrating, to the point of agonizing. No matter what, he couldn't approach her, because either she had pushed him away, or he pulled himself away. He could not even reason as to why he felt the way he did, or why the urge to see this through was so overpowering. In the end, he decided it was because that's just what friends do for one another. Surely, if what he had in Nabiki was a true friend, he never sincerely had real friendship in his life.<p>"So, young man, if I could enquire my daughter's suiter's name?"<p>Ranma's head snapped up, surprised to find the man sitting before him, instead of the kitchen; he hadn't even noticed his approach. "Uh... huh?"<p>Xian Ku Shui chuckled to himself, "My apologies if I startled you, but you were rather deep in contemplation."<p>"Oh," Ranma replied, guessing that was probably the reason his guard was down, "Ranma Saotome."<p>"Delighted to meet you, Mr. Saotome. My name is Xian Ku Shui, though you may call me simply Ku Shui."<p>"Ah... Haircomb?" Ranma replied, mispronouncing the name.<p>Ku Shui chuckled, and silently forgave the mistake. "I am rather surprised, considering Japanese attitudes, as to your courting my daughter."<p>"What? Ah, I'm not dating Shampoo! We're just sorta friends, really!"<p>"I see, forgive my confusion," Ku Shui apologised. "Young one, there seems to be a great deal on your mind... hold your reply until my return, please."<p>Ranma closed his mouth, as the man got up, and walked back into the kitchen. It was then that Ranma noticed the graceful, yet robust strides; Ku Shui obviously practiced the arts. It didn't take long before the Chinese man returned, and sat down.<p>"Forgive my interruption, I had to put on the noodles, and begin the broth."<p>Ranma blinked, he didn't think the man even had much time to open a pack of noodles, as quickly as he had returned, "Think nothing of it."<p>"What is it that troubles you?"<p>"Well, I guess its the one thing that troubles guys at some point in time..." Ranma replied, sighing.<p>"Ah, the confoundments of women. As simple their existance may be, their complexity is immense."<p>"I... guess... I just don't understand what's going on with Nabiki. It's just... I don't know, like she suddenly doesn't want anything to do with me!"<p>Ku Shui smiled warmly, before getting up, and returning to the kitchen, leaving Ranma to blink. In less time than Ranma would have considered, the man returned with a bowl of steaming ramen. "Please, continue."<p>As Ku Shui handed Ranma the bowl, the pigtailed young man did so, "I mean, I thought we were okay, but she just..." Ranma growled at his inability to even describe the problem.<p>"Yes, I recall having many of such dilemmas. As young as you are, you may have many more to come."<p>"Well, I would rather have none, if it were possible." Ranma retorted, before picking up a pair of chopsticks.<p>"You would not be human if that were possible." Ku Shui replied, "And it is but one duty of men to brave such assaults of women."<p>"Yeah... well does it get any easier to deal with over time?" Ranma enquired, "What did you do when you had to deal with it?"<p>"No, they tend to become more complex, considering the amount of commitment escalates with each infatuation," Ku Shui replied, "And as how I dealt with it... each moment had it's own solution. Sometimes it's simply giving in on one's behalf that is the answer."<p>"So I should just give up?" Ranma enquired with a hint of danger in his voice.<p>"Never, to do so would not solve anything, and set you back greatly. But, to give in to is to simply accept what comes naturally, instead of fighting for the answers."<p>"That makes some sense," Ranma replied, before tasting the ramen, "Hmm, this is pretty good!"<p>"Please enjoy," Ku Shui stated, accepting Ranma's comment, "I have many other tasks to perform. Please, I am not quite settled in your country, and a visit on occasion from one other than relatives would do me a great deal of joy."<p>Ranma understood the subtle request, "Hey, you cook as good as this, expect me to be around often, then!" Ku Shui smiled, before getting up, and returning to the kitchen.<p>_<p>Nabiki laid in bed, listening to the sounds of Ranma getting ready for school. For the last two days, she had been avoiding him, of course, she began to realise, it wasn't necessary, as he had also been avoiding her, too.<p>It was better this way, keep some distance from one another, recenter themselves so that things aren't as complicated as they felt right then.<p>He was always quiet during the mornings, though you could still hear him preparing a breakfast, the back door opening as he went out to practice for the morning, the door opening again to allow him entry, washing up in the bath, preparing breakfast, cleaning up, and then heading for school. Every morning, it was a cycle she would listen to, paying rapt attention as if it were a dramatic piano concerto, each part drawing a curious sensation.<p>The first part a feeling of wanting vigor and subtle envy, as she imagined his powerful movements through various kata; reinforcing his control over his strong, wirey form that was more toned and developed than many men older than him. The second inspiring more than a little lust and yearning, as she breathlessly thought of that gorgeous frame of cultivated muscle, senew, and bone glistening with water like dew on ivory. The third part diving forth a sense of comforting domesticality that riveted a warm longing, as Nabiki could hear his careful and skillful (although a bit potent in taste) preparations for breakfast, and his caretaking of the kitchen in consideration for his host.<p>Nabiki well knew how she felt about him, even if she were to cut her own heart out, there would be no denial of her wants. The thing was, she had fought it tooth and nail, snarl and hiss. She shouldn't feel that way for a young boy, at least that was the reason, right? The past had nothing to do with her resentment of her emotions. It was the eyes of society that she stood away from impractical and 'unethical' emotions. She had an exellent carreer. For a single, independant woman, she was well revered in her community and her work. She was well aware she was the idol of a few of her female co-workers, as well as a much saught after paramour for many of the male ones.<p>On that last note, she was not without potential suiters. The Austrailian from the other evening that she had a suspicion was more successful than he would let on. Isawo was a very attractive for his traditional contenance and stoic calm that made him the very picture of a modern Samurai. As she thought about it, Shampoo's father was handsome in his own right. So why a sixteen year old boy? Why not any of the many single, mature, successful, handsome men that she's encountered in her life?<p>She didn't think herself desperate enough for her heart to favor Ranma, simply because he was promised to her. She wasn't shallow enough to want him primarily as a trophy husband. There just wasn't any rhyme or reason to her sudden infatuation. Actually, it wasn't all that sudden, yet from the way it just crept on her before suddenly coming to the fore, it seemed much that way. Considering it, it had been a long time since she felt this way about anyone, not since...<p>Before full recollection set in, Nabiki forced her mind towards other things. She had been playing hookie for the last few days, and not that she would have a great deal of paperwork to contend with, her absense would raise a few questions she would rather not have to make excuses for. She may be the boss, but she was a boss that went out to set an example.<p>Yes, work, somewhere where she could busy her mind, hopefully putting away her dilemma until it magically disappeared. Nabiki wasn't so naive to believe that true, but having it constantly on her mind had her desperately grasping for any miracle that would deliver her from the ordeal.<p>She walked out of her room, and the lingering smell of Ranma's cooking hit her with enough force to conquer her stomach. With a groan, she made tired, almost listless strides for the kitchen, wishing Ranma would have cleaned up a bit better before he left. She wasn't particularly in the mood to make her own home breakfast, and with her stomach suddenly growling as it was, she wasn't sure she wanted to wait until she could make a stop somewhere.<p>The smell was strong when she entered the kitchen, and she focused her best to ignore it while she got the coffeepot started. After changing the filter and adding the water and fresh grounds, she turned to the dining room table to sit and wait, stopping at what she had seen.<p>The rest of the kitchen had been immaculate, so that didn't explain why the aroma was still strong. The plate of fish, rice, vegetables, a bowl of instant miso, and luke warm tea well went into explaining why her sense of smell was still behing held captive.<p>Nabiki rubbed her temples, sighing deeply, "Damn it, Ranma."<p>He certainly wasn't going to make this easy for her.<p>_<p>Nabiki looked over the thin stack of paperwork, feeling somewhat more relaxed in her duties. It felt almost refreshing, doing something that had been constant through a great portion of her adult life. Preparing the reports for clientelle was a bit on the mundane side, but it still provided her with a distraction. Unfortunately, it wasn't the only distraction she would have to encounter.<p>"Hey Nabiki, I stopped by a couple days ago, and..." Jesse stopped, still holding Nabiki's office door open, as the Tendou woman stared flatly at her.<p>Feeling the impending headache coming, Nabiki gently laid down the sheets of printout she was currently sorting, "Is there something I can do for you, Jesse? I'm rather busy, right now."<p>A bit taken back from the almost indifferent attitude, the American woman hesitatingly entered, and sat on the couch on the side of the office. "Haven't seen you in a minute, thought I would stop by to say hello, at least?"<p>"Nooo," Nabiki drawled out, going back to sorting, "You've come to meddle in my life. I've already told Nodoka and Shampoo to butt out, I guess I get to go for the triple play."<p>Jesse's smile faltered for a second, "I heard about Nodoka. Nabiki, girl, don't you think you were a little-"<p>"No, I was a great deal, and she deserved it." Nabiki glared up at Jesse, ceasing her other activities, "Quite frankly, I'm tired of the three of you trying to create your own sleezy romance novel with me and Ranma as the main characters. I have a life of my own, and it doesn't include Ranma as a love interest, or any other cradle-robbing of the sort."<p>Jesse sighed, "But you guys make an adorable couple!"<p>"DAMN IT, JESSE, STOP IT!" Nabiki shouted, slamming her palms into her desk, and coming to standing. She knew this confrontation would be coming, but she was still ill prepared to steel her temper. Through the still open door, a few of her employees looked in, startled at their boss's outburst. Wanting to keep the affair private, Nabiki quickly made her way to the door, and slammed it shut, before turning an angry, fustrated expression at the other woman occupying the room.<p>Jesse's eyebrows had climbed to the top of her forehead, just as surprised as everyone else at the outburst. While her tongue remained tied, Nabiki took the initiative.<p>"Get this straight, me and Ranma are NOT a couple! You just don't have a middle aged woman a part of a couple with a kid just in high school!"<p>"Why not?" Jesse began to counter, "If a middle aged guy can get married to some high school girl here in this country, I don't see why this is a big deal!"<p>"That's different!" Nabiki retorted, already knowing she lost ground with that attempted counter.<p>"And how is it different? Equal rights, I say."<p>"It... Hell, I don't even condone that!"<p>Jesse shrugged, crossing her legs with a smug expression, "I think you're just too scared to admit it. Ranma's got your number, doesn't he?"<p>"Are you even LISTENING to me?" Nabiki wailed, looking up to the heavens. Not only was Jesse the last one of the 'Fiance Brigade' she had to deal with, she would also be the worst. The worst, for the sheer reason she was probably even more stubborn than Nabiki on her best day. "This is my only warning, keep out of my lovelife! It's none of your damn business, understood?"<p>"Nabiki, level with me," the black woman began in a conversational tone, "When was the last time you've even had a man? I believe the answer was six years?"<p>Nabiki's face darkened even further, "Jesse..."<p>Jesse's expression grew solumn, "Six years... since Saito..."<p>Jesse had been warned. Nabiki turned away at the one name just about everyone knew not to mention around her. It was true, he was the last. The last one in several long years.<p>The black woman saw how rigid Nabiki went at the name, and put the pieces together in a haphazard puzzle, "So, that's what this is all about? Nabiki, this isn't healthy to be fixated over some asshole for-"<p>"YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO BRING HIM UP!" Nabiki shouted, storming up to Jesse. The American woman barely had time to stand to meet Nabiki's face-off.<p>"Nabiki-hon, I should have brought this up a long time ago," Jesse retorted, "We've always tap-danced around the subject, and you're easily transparent enough for me to see that this has been the whole problem, hasn't it? So one guy screwed around on you, why you going to let it dominate you forever?"<p>"This has nothing to do with him." Nabiki replied, coldly, "He is not part of this equation. This is just about me, Ranma, and your delusions of what should be going on between us. Quite frankly, I'm fed up with it. In fact, I'm fed up with you trying to fix me up with whatever 'stud' you think could give me a wild few nights."<p>"Oh, I think it has everything to do with Saito," Jesse retorted, allowing natural attitude to come to the fore, "What? You think Ranma's going to end up like that jerk? Ranma's still at least young enough that you can keep him from being a deadbeat, mooching punk that doesn't give a damn for you exept how much of your salary he can use to shack up with some hot little hussy!"<p>"Don't even compare Ranma to him," Nabiki demanded, "Don't even use their names in the same sentence."<p>"Fine! If they're not even associated with each other, what are you afraid of? Him using you?"<p>"I..." Nabiki knew that wasn't even close to the truth. Ranma just wouldn't, he just couldn't. In the back of her mind, a stray thought floated through; she never suspected Saito to be capable of what he did, either.<p>Jesse took the initiative on Nabiki's hesitation, "Don't you get it? Ranma won't be using you, you'll be using him!"<p>That stopped them both cold. The moment the words left Jesse's mouth, words that seemed so logical before uttering, the woman realized they were far from the right ones to say.<p>To Nabiki, it was like a seductive, sinister whisper had become a shout of infuriated spectors. She was suddenly clear on why, just why she thought she couldn't love Ranma, and Jesse inadvertantly revealed it. Ranma was young, he still had much in his life to do, a great deal he had to experience. And he should experience it with someone with that very same youth and vitality; someone he could grow further with at the same pace. Ranma needed someone who hadn't been matured by worldly experiences, someone who could share with him first time trials, so that they could deal with them together.<p>There were too many things that Nabiki was now jaded to. Too many experiences that had robbed her little by little of innocence, until she realized she was far from even the ambitious high school graduate she was long ago. She couldn't have Ranma, because it wasn't fair for Ranma at all. In the end, it did have something to do with Nabiki's once fiance; she had learned to care about others, before her own selfish yearnings.<p>Jesse startled and then backed away, when Nabiki began to shake. She jumped, when the other woman, suddenly began to chuckle, and then laugh.<p>Laughter; there was no greater fuel to douse the flames of heated confrontation. Nabiki's laughter did just that, as Jesse's eyes narrowed, "What's so damn funny?"<p>Nabiki attempted to stifle her laughter with her hand, and turned away from the woman, "I... this whole time... heh... thanks, you really helped me out here..."<p>Confusion; another highly combustable material.<p>Nabiki waived off Jesse's fustrated, angry expression, causing the latter to turn Nabiki back towards her roughly. "What the hell's gotten into you?"<p>Nabiki shook her shoulder from the woman's grip, "Deities, of course a woman who goes through husbands like they were kleenex couldn't even figure out what she said!"<p>::SLAP::<p>The truth hurt. The slap across Nabiki's face couldn't even convey the pain that surged through Jesse, as she discovered a little something about herself she never considered before.<p>Nabiki gingerly fingered her reddening cheek, without even turning to look at the other woman, "Get out." Jesse complied, glaring the whole time.<p>Nabiki staggered back to her desk, emotionally tired. Straight sweep; her sister Kasumi thought she was some sort of pedophile, and she's ostricized herself from her friends. All in all, it had been a busy week.<p>"Ouch..." Nabiki whimpered, rubbing her cheek.<p>_<p>Ranma flexed his hand, as he held his stance. The darkening clouds overhead called for rain, but his mind was much too concerned with a much more powerful dilemma than his curse currently presented to him.<p>Today, this day would be the battle he had avoided for the last couple of days. If it went on any further, Ranma wasn't sure what would happen, and the longer it went, the greater the uncertanty of where he and Nabiki stood in association.<p>Today would be the day he and Nabiki resolved whatever was driving them apart. This was one fight he had no idea how to face; his keen strategic mind would not be of any help this time. The only way he could even wish to win, was to completely let go of himself.<p>If he wanted Nabiki's forgiveness, this would be a battle he just couldn't lose. As he was fond of saying, Ranma Saotome doesn't lose.<p>_<p>Nabiki spent until late evening driving around with the only thing breaking her solice was the powerful engine under the hood of her car, and the windshield wipers squeeking against smooth glass to remove the spots of drizzle that found its way onto the barrier. She had no idea what was going to happen between her and Jesse, or her and Nodoka. Shampoo she hadn't been so harsh to, but she was pretty sure the young Amazon would stay gaurded against her.<p>The price she had to pay for peace of mind... probably wasn't worth it. In the end, she may have finally managed to isolate what it was between her and Ranma, but now Nabiki was probably more alone than she had been in years.<p>She returned home once she was sure Ranma would have gone to sleep. Even if she had gotten her feelings sorted out, she wasn't up for dealing with him. Actually, she wasn't up for dealing with anything exept her comfortable bed, and maybe a good romance book, and maybe some stress relief. Because, boy, was she stressed!"<p>She entered, almost without energy, and removed her shoes. She took a breath, before turning around, and screaming in fright.<p>Ranma stood at the doorway with his back against the darkness, and his arms crossed, and glaring at Nabiki, "Welcome home..."<p>Regaining her composure, Nabiki gave him a distainful look, "I had other obligations to take care of. Why are you still up? Planning on skipping school again?"<p>Ranma was a bit startled she knew about that, but reaffirmed himself, "So I took a day off, so what?"<p>"Goodnight, Ranma," Nabiki almost commanded Ranma, as she walked past him, heading for her room.<p>"No."<p>The older woman glared at Ranma, as he came to stand in front of her, "Ranma, I'm not in the mood for this."<p>"No can do, Nabiki," Ranma replied, crossing his arms as he stood defiantly, "Its time we talked."<p>"It's going to have to wait till later, Ranma, I'm tired, and I want to go to bed!" Nabiki shoved Ranma aside, and strode into into the living room en route to her room.<p>"Damn it!" Ranma shouted, rushing after Nabiki, "I'm getting tired of you hiding from me!"<p>Nabiki ducked down, just as Ranma reached, "It's not like you hadn't been keeping clear of me, either, Saotome!"<p>Ranma baulked at being called by his last name; a sign of distant formality, "Well I ain't avoiding you now!" Ranma reached down for Nabiki, "I had to think about stuff before we could chat!"<p>Nabiki turned towards Ranma to observe his movements, and quickly evaded with a single-handed backhand spring. All she needed to do was make it to her bedroom; sanctuary.<p>Ranma was still going low for her, but suddenly seemed to slide his body through his low stance, snagging her right arm as it was retracting with his left. Once he had firm hold, he twisted her arm inward.<p>"Ah!" Nabiki relented to the pressure, twisting around to face away from Ranma. The pigtailed young man then pressed his right hip against her back, wrapped his right arm around her waist, and performed a Judo hip toss, throwing her lengthwise onto the couch. Before Nabiki could even recover, Ranma leaped over the seating, and knelt at the fore of it, pressing his open palm firmly against Nabiki's shoulder, pinning her.<p>Nabiki glared at him, as she gingerly rubbed her wrist. At the look, Ranma almost baulked, but held his ground. "Sorry about your arm, but we ain't ending this night until we get everything out in the air!"<p>"Ranma, if you know what's good for you, you'll."<p>"I haven't figured out what's good for me for a while, Nabiki. We haven't even talked to one another in days!" Ranma turned to fully face his hostess, "I ain't the most cultured guy, or probably the most sensitive. But, this running around each other's been getting on my nerves!"<p>"Well, just to let you know, I was considering allowing you to go off on your little man-hunt for our fathers," Nabiki commented, "I've just been trying to-"<p>"No, we're not changing the subject!" Ranma interjected heatedly, "Now, whatever happened between us three days ago, what did I say to set you off?"<p>"Ranma! It's not important! I was just-"<p>"Just what? You ran off like you had demons chasing you! How was that supposed to make *me* feel?" Ranma cut her off once again, simply giving in to pent up emotions, "And then you avoid me like the plague! I at least thought you cared!"<p>Nabiki paused, and looked at Ranma with an apprehensive expression, "Ranma?"<p>"Three days, Nabiki, THREE days! I was... I was getting kinda scared of what was going on. I wasn't sure if I ticked you off something fierce, or what!" Ranma relinquished his hold on Nabiki's shoulder, turning to look at the TV, "You've... you've probably been the best person I've ever gotten to know. I didn't want to lose you over some stupid misunderstanding. I wanted the Nabiki back that didn't take everything I said so seriously. The Nabiki that was fun to be around. The Nabiki that probably had been my best friend... since I could remember."<p>"What about Ukyo?" Nabiki interjected, attempting to gain a foothold on things.<p>"I barely even remember her, Nabiki." Ranma replied, sadly, "Sure, we're friends now, but it's just not the same as what me and you have."<p>"What *do* we have, Ranma?" Nabiki asked in an acidic tone. as she sat up.<p>"We... I don't know *what* we have!" Ranma nearly shouted, throwing his arms up into the air, "But whatever 'it' is, I don't want to lose it!" Ranma turned back to Nabiki with a desperate expression, "Please. Whatever it is I did or said, I'm sorry. Just don't let it come between us!"<p>Nabiki stared, internally attempting to rebuild her defiance. As fiercely as she was battling, her determination found the crutch of her resolve crumbling under the weight it had been forced to bear. After Kasumi, after Nodoka, after Shampoo, and after Jesse, she thought she had finally earned her peace, even if it were at the cost of friendships; potential, growing, or rooted. After all the hard-fought battles, after gaining precious inch by inch, she lost against the one opponent she couldn't see. Her heart.<p>Finally, she had no choice. Bowing her head, she give up. She had lost.<p>Ranma watched Nabiki, as she brought her knees to her chest, and wrapped her arms around her legs. "Nabiki?" That feeling of impotency was once again cycling itself through Ranma. At her silence, it was hard to guage her. Shooting to standing, Ranma reached out and grabbed both of the woman's shoulders, "Nabiki!"<p>At the second time her name was called, the older woman finally spoke, "I... I think I know what we have, Ranma."<p>She looked up at the pigtailed young man with an expression he had never seen on her before. It was as if she has mustered all of the emotion she was capable into her face, making her seem nothing like the confident, secure woman he had come to appreciate. in the almost completely absent light, to him, she seemed smaller...<p>...timid...<p>...vunerable.<p>"Ranma, do you even realize how much I cared for you? Do you know how hard I fought... I fought not to do this to either of us?"<p>"Do what?" Ranma enquired, almost mesmerised by her face. Part of him wanted nothing more but to find a way to remove the heart-wrenching expression from her. That part of him was barely being kept at bay.<p>Nabiki slowly brought herself to standing, causing Ranma to back away, "Ranma, I don't know how it happened, and no matter what I told myself, I just couldn't..."<p>Nabiki started walking towards Ranma, causing the pigtailed boy to back up almost unconciously.<p>Nabiki started over, "There's... something I need from you, but I didn't want to take it from you. I don't deserve it."<p>Ranma was only aware of the woman before him, so he didn't realize until too late that he backed into a wall. Gulping at the tempest within him, he had no other recourse but to remain Nabiki's audience.<p>Even after Ranma stopped, Nabiki continued to move closer, completely entering his personal space, undaunted, "But, you know, Ranma?" Her left arm slowly reached over his shoulder, as she pressed her forearm into the wall next to his head. He could feel the warmth radiating from her limb, lightly brushing his ear, and jumped, when he felt even hotter breath against his jawline.<p>"I think I just... stopped caring," Nabiki finished, bringing her right hand up to cradle the back of Ranma's head, as she leaned in, and captured his lips.<p>Ranma was only receiving for the briefest of moments, before his own arms started to move around Nabiki's waist. They hesitated, before slowly enveloping the woman, pulling her tighter against her. In the dark room, a flash of lightning illuminated their silouette, while no thunder sounded in it's following.
