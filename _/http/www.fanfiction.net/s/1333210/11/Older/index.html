</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki sighed, as she leaned into the man whose arms protectively incircled her. She pouted, slightly, as one of his arms rose from its firm grasp on her waist, but smiled softly, as it reached for the glass of chilled wine that he had poured for them to share. Carefully, his strong hand brought the champaign glass to her lips, allowing her a small sip, before he pulled it away, bringing it to his own lips.<p>She snuggled deeper into his chest, taking a slight sniff of his scent that had now been tainted with her own, as he set the glass down on the nightstand by the bed, and his arm returned to holding her. She groaned audibly, as she felt the fabric of her satin gown rub against her bare skin as his arm brushed it, sending warm, succulent tremors through her stomach that began to build up lower.<p>She didn't say anything, and she didn't want him to say anything, for fear it would ruin the moment between them. She had nothing to worry about, as he had seemed to plan the whole night for her maximum enjoyment. Alas, as much as she enjoyed the snuggling, she wanted more from him. She wanted to return to their far more intimate embrace that had brought them both to a comforting lethergy, an activity that only two who really trusted each other shared. It was far more than sex, it was just simply... more.<p>Almost as if reading her mind, Nabiki felt one of his hands sliding south. Delicately brushing against her stomach, then lower into territory that she would be more than hesitant to allow anyone to approach. But not the man holding her, not the young, powerfully built sixteen year old that promised to never hurt her, to always offer his comfort and security, to make any pain go away, and to meet her as an equal, a friend, and a lover.<p>The realization of these thoughts sent shivers through her that were like subtle pulses of electricity. She turned her head, wanting to transfer some of the energy she was feeling. Her lips began to part, expecting to meet his, just as his hand about reached it's destination<p>Nabiki shot up, wide-eyed and sweating, despite the comfortable temperature of the bed and her room. Her startled eyes roamed the dark room, until the fell upon her alarm clock. It was almost ten minutes until she had to wake up. With an exasperated groan, she dropped back into bed, realizing it was probably going to be a long day.<p>_<p>Ranma felt a bit better than he had the last few days. Nabiki was no longer attempting to ignore him, which made a great deal of difference in his own attitude. It wasn't as if he LIKED her, or something, he just realized it was better to get along with people, helping to maintain the peace of the home. It was a lot more comforting to meet her tired, but warm smile in the morning, than her curt replies, as she attempted to rush by him.<p>"Morning Nabiki," Ranma greeted, as he set out two plates on the dining table. Blearily, Nabiki walked to the table, and sat down, before turning to the kitchen, and noted the lack of Shampoo.<p>"Where's Shampoo?" Nabiki enquired, feeling a growing dread that Ranma cooked breakfast. Granted, it wasn't anywhere near as bad as her sister's used to be, but she still didn't enjoy dealing with it.<p>Oblivious to her growing apprehension, Ranma set the dish of stir-fry on the table, "Huh? I don't think she came back, yesterday."<p>"Oh," Nabiki replied in a dejected tone, as she watched Ranma cheerfully scoop her out a spoonful of vegetables, rice, and chicken. She turned to look at him, a bit taken aback by his smile, "You're awfully chipper this morning."<p>Ranma blinked, and looked at Nabiki, "Well, I guess it just feels like it's going to be a good day, that's all." Ranma looked down, noticing Nabiki suddenly staring with a blank look, "What?"<p>Unaware of the blush forming on her face, Nabiki quickly turned away, "N-nothing, nothing, that's good."<p>Ranma let it go, as he finished serving Nabiki, leaned away from where he was pressed against her back, and went over to his seat. Ranma glanced over at Nabiki, who emitted a sigh of relief. "Something wrong?"<p>At the question, Nabiki jolted, "Er, no, what makes you say that?"<p>Ranma gave her a sideglance, "You're acting kinda jumpy."<p>Nabiki took a deep breath, before preparing to take a bite of Ranma's cooking, "Early morning jitters, that's all." She tentatively took a taste, pausing, and lifted a larger portion to her mouth with her chopsticks. She blinked, and turned to look at Ranma with a puzzled expression.<p>Ranma smiled nervously, "Well, I kinda remembered how you don't like your spicy or really potent, so I left the extra seasoning out for you."<p>For several moments, Nabiki wasn't sure what to say, before deciding the simplest thing to say was the best, "Thank you, Ranma."<p>"Er... no problem." Ranma replied, not looking up from his plate. The rest of breakfast was spent in silence, until Ranma abrupty announced he had to head for school. For both of them, his departure was a heartfelt release from the building tension.<p>_<p>Nabiki watched her client walk out the door, before she slumped her head onto her desk. Today, she was having a difficult time keeping her mind straight on things, thanks to certain complication a more than pleasant dream, coupled with an unintentional brush against a certain pigtailed boy. It couldn't go on like this, she thought. Maybe it was just a one day thing. One of those times when a random spike in hormones decide to appear, making Nabiki consider all sorts of randy thoughts. That's what the small trashy romance novel collection by her bed was for, after all.<p>Then again, it did start bringing other things into consideraton. Even if it was a one day thing, how often would this come around? She didn't know how long she would have Ranma staying with her, and things could get realllllyyyy complicated if she wasn't paying attention. maybe, maybe it was time that she stopped playing the 'strong, independent' woman, and found herself..."<p>Nabiki sighed, "Jesse is going to have a field day with this..."<p>"Have a field day with what?"<p>_<p>Shampoo wandered in to Nabiki's home, almost completely exhausted. Her great-grandmother most assuradly worked her over last night, finding the most menial things for the young amazon to do, while demanding an expedient completion. Cologne was more irritated to believe that Shampoo was directly going against her orders, which she was in actuality. She didn't find any romantic interest in Ranma, since the boy was only a few paces removed from the good side of Mousse. Ranma was better than her childhood friend, sure, but definitely nothing less obnoxious in his own way.<p>"Where've you been, Shampoo?"<p>Speak of the devil, "Shampoo... I work on restuarant with great-grandmother. Work too, too hard."<p>"Oh, Ranma replied, as he sat on the couch.<p>Shampoo craned her head in curiosity, "What you doing?" she asked, approaching the side of the couch.<p>"Just listening to some of Nabiki's stuff," Ranma replied, before he went back to almost studying the music.<p>Shampoo lifted her head to listen more closely to the song being played, "Is good song, Shampoo think."<p>"Hmm," Ranma replied, not taking his attention from the soft jazz, "It's kinda boring."<p>Shampoo shrugged, "Then why you listen?"<p>After a long pause, Ranma finally replied, "It has some good parts, you know? It's not all that bad."<p>The Amazon smirked, gaining an idea of what Ranma was trying to do, "Is Nabiki favorite?"<p>"Dunno, I just sorta picked one."<p>"You ask her what favorites are, she tell you. Much easier to find out what make Nabiki tick if know what she listen to, most."<p>"I guess, but-hey!" Ranma turned to look at a grinning Shampoo, "What makes you think that I'm doing this to figure out 'what makes her tick'?"<p>Shampoo shrugged, "Shampoo sorry, Ranma no trying to understand Nabiki without Nabiki knowing."<p>"Glad we're in agreement," Ranma replied, getting up, and turning off the entertainment system.<p>Shampoo held down a giggle; that was one cute thing about the boy, the way he tried to deny the most innocent things, like actually caring about Nabiki. "Ranma, why you say you no care for Nabiki?"<p>"I, um, care for her, but not in the way you're insinuating, alright?" Ranma replied, "She's a nice woman, and I'd do anything for her, but she's... well..."<p>"Mature, seasoned, experienced, is what bother you?" Shampoo asked in a arched tone.<p>"Well, yeah, they bother me a little," Ranma replied, scratching the back of his head, "But... well, she's older, and we're just, you know, so different!"<p>Shampoo internally cheered, at least he was considering the woman past her age, "Is good different, too, too much to learn from each other."<p>Ranma gained a whistful expression, as he headed to the kitchen, "Not sure if it's supposed to work that way."<p>"No know how it work. Nobody do. Just know it work, and no question it."<p>"I don't know, it just doesn't seem right, okay?" Ranma replied a bit sharply, "It's almost like... like dating my Mom, or something!"<p>"Nabiki no you mom..." Shampoo shook her head in remourse, "No wish anyone date you Mom, even you father."<p>Ranma chuckled, "You didn't get to meet much of Pops, did you?"<p>Shampoo tilted her head, "Just silly panda who stuff face too, too much. Remind me of girl who stuff face, too, too much."<p>"That was a low blow, you know that?" Ranma replied, giving Shampoo an icy glare.<p>Shampoo only smiled, "Ranma be happy Shampoo no think why Ranma too much like Mom."<p>_<p>Nabiki rarely acted on impulse, but for some reason, didn't find the inclination to return home. Ranma was there, probably waiting for her, and that comforted her and filled her with apprehension at the same time. The latter actually stemmed from the former; she wasn't sure if it was from a simple dream, something that may have been building, longing, or even curiosity that made her think of Ranma as 'safe'.<p>He was just the opposite, really. Even if she were to give a slight consideration to a relationship with him, it wasn't... well, right, she supposed, and was well doomed from the start. Ranma was young but well formed for someone his age, a bit bull-headed while innocent, somewhat obnoxious but in an endearing way, and inconsiderate but apologetic.<p>She took a sip from her beer, before turning to look up at the balcony of the attic restaruant where she usually sat. It was an unspoken rule that anyone sitting up there was already taken, or not particularly interestes. Few singles ever sat up there, and she was one of the few.<p>It had been a while since she had taken the view of it from where she was at, with her own reasons. Those reasons be damned, she had decided that her life couldn't be goverened by one incident, even if it was a signifigant one.<p>Tonight, the acoustic band onstage was a new one, not one she had seen there before, at least. It was rare that anything other than soft rock or contemporary jazz was played, but the occasional break wasn't shunned. Nabiki found the smooth R&amp;B bass something of a welcome change of pace, as it almost smybolically represented a transition in life...<p>The woman shook her head, and chuckled lightly to herself, trying to be metaphoric wasn't something she really though herself capable of.<p>"A bit different from what we usually get around here."<p>Nabiki didn't even turn around, and shrugged, "I can't complain, the music's not all that bad."<p>"Actually, I'm pretty partial to it, myself... mind if I sit down? Noticed you had a free seat."<p>Nabiki motioned to the chair across from her, "Help yourself." She heard the seat slide out, and a firm weight place itself upon it. The man wasn't overweight, rather fit from what she figured.<p>"I... noticed you usually sit up there. Do you enjoy the view from the balcony?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, still concentrating on the music group, "Decided to be closer to the music, tonight."<p>"I see. American music. They've always had a certain panache with their lyrics, that is when they're not written by a single woman who hadn't had a date in her life, secluded in a small apartment and doing nothing but producing song after song after song..."<p>Nabiki smirked; he had a bit of humor.<p>"The Americans seem to like talking about ideals, what they would do for their ideal woman, how they would relentlessly attempt to please whomever, placing their needs well above their own..."<p>Nabiki took a sip of her beer, before replying, "Friend of mine quaintly refers to it as 'booty music'."<p>Nabiki heard his chuckle, and decided that he was about to become a lost cause. Her reply was a loaded one, made to guage his interests. it was sounding like he was particularly interested in only one thing.<p>"Well, I guess that's an endearing term for it. Never much considered it, nor heard that name before."<p>Nabiki's left eyebrow raised, somewhat surprised. Since he had made it past the first gate, she decided to favor him with her attention. She turned to him, finding a blond foreigner sitting next to her. She realized the accent at that moment, having not really been paying attention to it previously, "Austrailian?"<p>The man nodded, giving Nabiki his most gracious smile, "I'm currently living here in Japan on a... business contract. Once it's over, I may stay, assuming work here does well."<p>"Ah, have you been her long?" Nabiki asked, deciding to continue the conversation. From how it sounds, he was successful, at least modestly. Then again, she still needed to learn more about him, after all, he may be a contract killer or something.<p>"Just a few months. Haven't been able to see much of the country, unfortunately. Work demands a strenuous schedule."<p>"What sort of work do you do?" the direct approach, she was getting a bit tired of beating around the bush.<p>His smile strained a bit... "Entertainment."<p>Nabiki gave him a withering glance, before looking back at the band, "You're not trying to solicit me for some 'job opportunity', are you?"<p>"Huh? NO! NO! Nothing like that!" His outburst attracted the irritated attention of some of the other patrons, before he gave them all an apologetic smile, and returned to looking at Nabiki. "I'm not in any type of business like that. I'm just... part of a film crew working with a studio here in Japan."<p>Nabiki looked him directly in the eyes, "You sure are being evasive about it."<p>"I can't say much about it, I'm afraid," he replied, factually. "I didn't get your name?"<p>"I haven't... Tendou, Nabiki Tendou." Nabiki sighed, realizing being so defensive was childish.<p>"Steven Cromwell. Glad to have met you."<p>"So... Steve..." Nabiki gauged his reaction to the shortening of his name. When he smirked, she recalled that many foreigners were accustomed to strangers doing so, "Why this chair? There are plenty of other open ones around."<p>"I presumed that this one came with pleasant company," he replied in a sardonic tone.<p>"Hmm," Nabiki looked at the nearly empty amber colored bottle, "I think that still may be up for debate."<p>"Would you like another? Another beer, I mean."<p>Nabiki polished off what was left, and checked her watch. She had been working on that one for quite some time, so she wasn't in any danger, "I guess another one couldn't hurt..."<p>_<p>Ranma tossed hiss feet in the air, as he continued to watch at the TV. As he lay on the floor in front of it, Shampoo occupied the couch, nibbling on the popcorn Ranma had made for them to share. Not that Shampoo minded, but she noticed Ranma had barely touched it during the whole procession of the movie.<p>"Want popcorn?"<p>"I'm fine, alright?" Ranma replied, a bit curtly. Shampoo rolled her eyes, and looked up at the clock.<p>With a slight snort, she turned her attention back to the movie. Even though Ranma continued to stare forward, she knew his scowl was still there. At the risk of losing whatever diplomacy was between them, Shampoo gave into her irritation, "Ranma, Nabiki fine."<p>Ranma turned to glare at Shampoo, "Why would I care what that old woman does when she has to be at work in the morning?"<p>"She no *have* to, she choose to," Shampoo interjected, recalling her talk with Nabiki about the older woman's job.<p>"No, she has clients tomorrow." Ranma replied, turning back to the TV.<p>"You have school tomorrow, yes?" Shampoo counter-argued, arching her tone.<p>"Whatever," Ranma didn't bother to turn around, increasing the pace of his swinging feet.<p>"Ranma, if you is..." Shampoo was interrupted by the door opening. Actually, she was interrupted by the breeze that brushed past her, just as the door was opening.<p>Ranma abruptly stopped in the front hall, just as Nabiki was entering. Nabiki stopped, and blinked at Ranma's irritated expression, "Isn't tonight a school night?"<p>"Don't you have to be at work tomorrow?" Ranma retorted.<p>Nabiki jerked back slightly at the reply, before removing her jacket, "I'll be fine. It's not like I'm losing much sleep time."<p>"That's not the point! Where the heck were you? You're usually never out this late!"<p>"Ranma, hon, I'm a grown woman now, you don't have to worry about me," Nabiki replied, finding Ranma's anxiousness somewhat cute.<p>"For all we knew, you coulda been in a car wreck! I've seen the way you drive!"<p>The smile Nabiki had been carrying since she left the bar faded instantly, "That was one incident, Ranma. And, as I recall, someone was distracting me."<p>"So, it's my fault you can't keep your eyes on the road?"<p>"Oh, Geez, Ranma. I was having a pleasant evening, too." Nabiki hung up her coat, removed her shoes, and brushed by Ranma. "Hey, Shampoo."<p>"He like this all night," Shampoo replied, not turning from the TV.<p>"My condolences... there are better kung fu flicks down there, you know? I'm surprised you two made it this far into it."<p>"Quit ignoring me, will ya?" Ranma demanded, walking back in.<p>Nabiki sighed, before turning to Ranma, "I'm not ignoring you, but if you want my attention, you're going to need to calm down, and stop acting like my father."<p>Ranma's expression darkened, before he turned away, "Fine, see if I care next time, then. Stupid old woman..."<p>Nabiki shook her head, as she watched him walk upstairs, "He really is being a jerk tonight, isn't he?"<p>Shampoo turned to Nabiki with a sympathetic expression, "He worried about you. Mean he care, even if say no so."<p>"I don't care, alright!"<p>Both Shampoo and Nabiki decided to ignore Ranmas refute from upstairs. "I guess I probably could have at least called to tell you guys I was out late, sorry."<p>"Is no me you should apologize to," Shampoo stated, factually, turning back to the movie. "Movie bad, but funny bad."<p>Nabiki didn't give a reply to Shampoo, choosing instead to go upstairs. She found Ranma's door closed, and instead of opening it, respected his privacy, "Ranma? I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was out. It was sweet of you to be worried."<p>"Like you really care..."<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes, "Look, Ranma. For what it's worth, I really am sorry, okay? I just let time run off with me." After several moments of silence, Nabiki shook her head, and walked downstairs. She'll just have to clear everything up tomorrow.<p>_<p>Nabiki woke up, slightly dreading the morning. It wasn't really all that different from any other morning, she needed to get up, eat breakfast, do her usual morning workout, get cleaned up, and go to work. The only addition was apologising to Ranma.<p>"Really, if he wants to sulk, I should just let him," Nabiki mumbled to herself, "Typical guy; no matter what the age." She stopped that line of thinking, realizing it would probably make her apology sound less sympathetic. If Ranma didn't buy it, it would bother her for the rest of the day.<p>Nabiki almost chuckled, she wasn't even dating Ranma, and she was already at her wit's end with him. She slipped out of bed, paused, and reached under the covers to retrieve her pajamma bottoms. The temperature was a bit higher than she normally left it at night, apparently she forgot to turn down the thermostat again. The price for enjoying a good snuggle under the covers on a cool night.<p>Why was she going to apologise to Ranma again? Nabiki shook her head lightly, attempting to gain more of her bearings for the morning. She remembered that it was because Ranma had truly been concerned about her whereabouts. Nabiki had to recall the last time someone actually had been worried about her, other than superfically or obligatingly. It actually felt... nice.<p>Nabiki decided that her apology would come in dinner, at a location of Ranma's choosing. It may have seemed like she was bribing him for his forgiveness, but she supposed he she could indulge him at least once. She wasn't sure what he did with his days, only on occasion did he actually spend much time out of school from her house when it wasn't on an errand, despite that she had been giving him a slight stipend for him to do whatever he pleased with.<p>She walked to the dining room, deciding that was one of the conversational topics she could save for the evening. She entered the kitchen, putting on her gameface, and found Shampoo and Ranma already seated and eating. Both teens glanced up at her entrance, and nodded in greeting, before returning to their own meals.<p>"Good morning," Nabiki ventured, not sure of the mood.<p>"Morning," both chorused in reply. Nabiki's lips started to tighten, as she still hadn't recieved any cues.<p>It was decided just to be open about it, "Ranma...?" Nabiki shifted her eyes quickly over to Shampoo in silent message.<p>The Amazon understood it, loud and clear, "Shampoo have to go to bathroom."<p>Once she had gotten up and left, the pigtailed boy looked up at her with a guileless, but expectant expression. Nabiki looked down at the table, suddenly feeling a bit of apprehension. She strangled it down, and spoke, "Ranma, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about last night. I didn't think about it, and it wasn't fair to your or Shampoo."<p>"Don't mention it," Ranma replied, returning to eating his breakfast.<p>Nabiki blinked, "I mean it, Ranma. You're not mad at me, are you?"<p>"Nope."<p>Nabiki blinked again, "Are you sure?"<p>"Mmmhmm."<p>Nabiki blinked once more, "Just like that?"<p>Ranma shrugged, "No big deal, I guess. Not like any harm was done, right?"<p>Nabiki wasn't sure she bought such an easy acceptance to her apology. "How about dinner tonight?"<p>Ranma almost bit through his chopsticks, as he shifted his eyes to look at Nabiki without turning his head, "Wha?"<p>"My treat, of course," Nabiki quickly blurted out.<p>"Us... go out...?" Ranma asked, uneasily.<p>"Well, that was the proposition," Nabiki replied, sardonically, "You, me, and Sh-"<p>"Whoa! Gotta get to school!" Ranma suddenly interjected, jumping out of his seat quickly.<p>"Hold on a sec, Ranma, I-"<p>"Can't talk, gotta hurry!" Ranma quickly rushed to the door, slipped on his shoes, and rushed out. Nabiki stared, realizing he hadn't even put on his school uniform.<p>_<p>That, to say, was extremely awkward.<p>Ranma in class, as usual barely paying much attention. Nabiki was going to probably ask him out again, as soon as he got back home. He didn't miss the nervousness in her voice when she was starting to address him, now it was pretty apparent that she was flustered about asking him out on a date.<p>She really wasn't taking this engagement thing seriously, was she? Sure, Ranma knew he was a prime specimen of manliness, but Women Nabiki's age should only be lusting after him, not trying to indulge. Of course, the idea that she was hot for him filled him with no little sense of pride.<p>He also was a bit confused to Nabiki's reaction when she apologised about last night. Sure she goofed up, but it was practically a day ago. Ranma didn't really entertain grudges, nor did he care to hold ill feelings for long. His Pops always told him that doing so was poor for dicipline... it was usually said when and/or after they had run from someone who held a particularly vicious grudge against them...<p>"Saotome!"<p>Ranma's hand shot up, catching the erasor before it impacted with his head, "Wuzzat?"<p>The teacher sighed, deciding he shouldn't even bother with that diciplinary tactic against the pigtailed martial artist, "If you're ready to join the rest of the class..."<p>"Sorry," Ranma replied, sheepishly. Next time, he would have to make it more unapparent that he wasn't listening to the instructor.<p>_<p>"If you forgive me for noticing, you seem a bit more cheerful, Ms. Tendou."<p>Nabiki looked up from where she was reviewing Mr. Isawo's reports, "Excuse me?"<p>The fifty year old man tilted his head non-chilantly, "It's just that over the past couple of weeks, you've just seemed a bit distracted, that's all. Normally you're a very attentive and focused woman, one of the many things I admire about you."<p>"Ah..." Nabiki was a bit unprepared for the compliment, having a sneaking suspicion that the normally formal and oft-times stoic client was flirting with her, "Well, I've had some unexpected complications in my personal life, as of late. I apologise for letting it affect me as you've noticed."<p>"It is nothing to apologise for, I was actually rather concerned, but didn't want to pry." Mr. Isawo folded his hands over his lap, and leaned back in his chair, "As usual, I am positive of the progress information you were intending to inform me of, perhaps you would care to address your own dilemma? I've been informed I am an attentive listener."<p>Why yes, yes he was flirting, Nabiki realized, "I wouldn't want to burdon you with my own."<p>"It wouldn't be a burdon at all, Ms. Tendou. I admit that I am... a bit interested in you welfare..."<p>Nabiki held her breath, while straining to keep he pleasant smile...<p>_<p>Ranma slowly walked up the street, not at all in a big hurry to return to Nabiki's house. It wasn't like he was afraid of anything, he was a man among men, and a martial artist top tier, so fear wasn't accountable. He just didn't quite feel like dealing with what he knew was awaiting him there. Of course, if he didn't return, Nabiki and Shampoo would probably think he was scared of something. Obviously he knew that wasn't true, but he couldn't let it appear that way.<p>He could see his destination just up the street with Nabiki's car parked in the driveway, and decided that he may as well get it over with. He was entering the door only a few minutes later, "I'm back."<p>"Welcome back, Ranma," Nabiki greeted from where her room was at the other end of the house, "How was school?"<p>Ranma blinked, not ever recalling her asking that question of him, "Ah... okay, I guess."<p>"That's good," Nabiki met Ranma about midway, near the living room, "Did you consider what you wanted to do, tonight?"<p>Truth be told, Ranma was kind of hoping she had forgotten the idea she proposed in the morning. "Na," he replied, non-chilantly, "Not really interested in doing anything special."<p>Nabiki sighed, feeling a slight dejection, "Ranma, it's my treat. All you need to do is provide a body to accept my generousness. I know it's not like you got a lot of perks being on the road, after all."<p>"It's not like I need all that crap," Ranma argued, "Don't see why you're so eager for it."<p>Nabiki suddenly thought on that question herself, but quickly dismissed it, "Fine, all I wanted to do was something nice for a friend and guest, and you can't even show some gratitude."<p>"Well, if it means that much to you... alright, alright. Just let me get changed, and we'll go, happy?"<p>Nabiki huffed, "Well, don't humor me on my account. If you don't want to go, that's fine with me!" Nabiki was too preoccupied with her own irritation to feel the glare from Ranma boring into her back as she walked away.<p>_<p>Ranma glared directly across the table at Nabiki. Nabiki glared directly across the table from Ranma. Ranma continued to glare across the table at Nabiki, as Nabiki continued to glare across the table at Ranma.<p>Ranma blew at her crimson bangs, causing them to billow slightly. Nabiki rapped her fingernails against the white clothed table once. Ranma then scratched her wrist, forcing Nabiki to match the ante by adjusting the front of her blouse. Ranma challenged the gesture by smoothing out her black silk shirt, and straigtening out the frog ties. Nabiki would not be felled, as she brushed her hand against her hair to ensure no strands were sticking out unsightly. At the stalemate, they both continued to glare at one another.<p>Eventually, one of them would have to make the first move, "Happy now?"<p>Both Ranma and Nabiki blinked at their unified chorus. Getting her wits first, Ranma continued, "Hey! You're the one who wanted to take me out!"<p>"Well, you wouldn't stop bothering me about it until I did," Nabiki replied in a dry, irritated tone.<p>"Only because you had to go and guilt trip me into it!"<p>Nabiki picked up her glass of water, staring at Ranma over it, "I do not 'guilt trip'."<p>Ranma snorted, "Sure, whenever I say something you don't like, you go and get all moody about it. I mean, that whole 'silent treatment' thing, and getting Shampoo into the act..." Ranma turned away, and put her chin in the palm of her hand as her elbow rested on the table, "... real mature for an old lady..."<p>Nabiki almost slammed her glass down, and began a scathing retort, but paused as her mouth opened. Ranma lazily shifted her eyes back to Nabiki, almost feeling dejected for not getting a reply.<p>"I guess it wasn't all that mature of me, was it." Ranma's eyebrows climbed, as she turned to give Nabiki her full attention. Nabiki gave her an apologetic and chagrinned smirk, before continuing, "Ranma, how am I supposed to deal with you, anyways?"<p>"Whaddya mean?"<p>Nabiki took a deep breath, before sitting back, "We don't have much in common, do we, Ranma?"<p>The pigtailed girl shrugged, "Well, I guess not..."<p>"It's pretty hard, for me at least, to just, well, talk with you."<p>"If you hadn't noticed, we're talking right now..."<p>Nabiki reigned in her temper before it got away with her. Ranma had been right about the way she was acting, and it was pretty selfish of her. The way she handled the backhanded insults and the none too subtle jibes from Jesse were taken in stride. She got along well with her American friend, even if she tended to get on her last nerve. Nodoka... she could put up with on a slightly less than formal basis, but she had to constantly keep her guard up. With Ranma, she tended to take things to heart, even when she knew full well he probably didn't mean them.<p>Thinking back on when she was younger, she recalled some of the sarcastic comments she made, particularly against her father. It wasn't as if she held her elders in contempt, it was just that she saw it as a way to either prove herself their equal or their better. The more scathing the comment, the more likely the latter.<p>Ranma, on the other hand, didn't display that subtle malice in his comments, even if they were sharp. Either he was exellent at feigning obliviousness (which she oh so sincerely doubted), or they weren't to be taken seriously.<p>"Ah... Earth to Nabiki?"<p>Nabiki's eyes refocused, "Hmm?"<p>Ranma's concerned expression quickly dropped back to her impassive one, "You kinda zoned out on me for a sec. Thought you were getting Alzheimers or something."<p>At Ranma's comment, Nabiki figured she had two options. She chose the least expected one. Allowing a small smile to cross her lips, Nabiki chuckled.<p>Her humor grew almost to being uncontained, as Ranma's expression grew to dumbfoundment, before a smirk was drawn from her own lips. Nabiki noticed Ranma's posture, as she leaned back and settled her weight into her chair. Her shoulders seemed to sag a bit, as she easily laid a hand on the tabletop...<p>Ranma was relaxing.<p>It never occured to her how tense Ranma was around her, then again, she had been pretty absorbed with herself, she figured. "Heh, I guess I did space out for a bit, sorry."<p>"Ah, it's nutt'n." Ranma replied, non-chilantly.<p>"I wouldn't say that. Daddy would have been all over my case if I did that around him. I wouldn't have heard the end of it, 'A martial artist must always be aware of themselves and their enviorment'!"<p>"Heh, that's nothing. My Pops woulda had a cow, and come up with some sort of idiotic training method to fix the problem."<p>"Oh, do tell!" Nabiki enquired, leaning on her hands.<p>Ranma's eyes wided a fraction, when she noticed Nabiki's chest not quite flatten a she leaned over. The pigtailed girl quickly recalled some instances to take her mind off of the display before her, "Well, there was the time he almost pushed me off the cliff face when I was staring at the twin mountain peaks back in China, and-"<p>"He. What. ?"<p>"ACK!" Ranma jolted back, as Nabiki's expression went ice cold, "I MEAN THE VALLEY- STARING AT THE SCENERY!"<p>Nabiki raised one eyebrow at Ranma's response, "Your father tried to push you off a cliff?" Not that her opinion of the man could really get much lower, but...<p>"Ah," Ranma waived her concern off, internally grateful she didn't notice the slip, "It's no big deal, he used to try crap like that all the time. Thought a martial artist should always be on guard. Not that there was anything wrong with that, but I guess sometimes he took some prize moments to try to make a point."<p>"You don't believe that, do you?" Nabiki enquired in a soft voice.<p>"Hey, it's a martial artist fact of life, and martial arts are my life," Ranma replied, seeming unconcerned.<p>Even if Nabiki was deaf, she wouldn't have missed the distain in her voice. That would be one thing they worked on, she silently vowed.<p>"Say, Ranma," Nabiki picked up a menu, and began to shift through it, "What else do you like to do? I don't really see you involved in much else, and I would think it gets pretty boring sitting around the house, or just practicing all the time."<p>"Not really much else I can think of, really. Whenever Pop gave me some free time to myself, I used to check out some of the dojos in whatever area we were in."<p>"I guess that would be a good way to meet people your age," Nabiki commented, barely paying attention. If she had stopped looking through the menu, she may have caught the way Ranma's expression flashed in irritation.<p>"When's the waiter getting back?" Ranma asked, holding her annoyance from her voice.<p>At the lack of a conversational tone, Nabiki looked back up to the redhead, noticing the way she sat rigidly. "You know what you want?"<p>"I'll get whatever," Ranma replied, waiving the question off.<p>"Ranma, what was it like roaming all over China?"<p>Ranma turned back to Nabiki, pausing for a few moments before speaking, "Pretty, I guess, why?"<p>"Ranma, you've probably been to places I'll only come close to through a travel guidebook, and I'm fairly well traveled, myself," Nabiki replied with a smirk.<p>"Yeah, I remember hearing about you once visiting Europe?"<p>Seeing Ranma present an opportunity, Nabiki took it, "Well, there's a lot in Europe, anywhere in particular you want me to start?"<p>Ranma mused on it, before speaking, "England?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, "Sure, but why there?"<p>"First thing that came to mind, really."<p>"Well, mostly cold and wet when I went," Nabiki began to recount, "but there were a lot of places to visit. Unfortunately I stayed mostly in the London area, since that's where my tour mainly concentrated in."<p>"Did you see that rock thing? The one that's supposed to be a calender?"<p>Nabiki smirked, "You mean Stonehenge? Not much to look at, really. I mean the wall in York was more interesting."<p>"Oh." Ranma replied, presuming the trip to England something of a bust, "Well, where else did you go?"<p>Nabiki folded her hands in front of her, "From there, we went back to Belgium, which is where I started the tour-"<p>"Who went with you?"<p>Nabiki stopped at the interruption, "Pardon?"<p>"Did your sisters... or someone go with you?"<p>Nabiki sighed wistfully, shaking her head, "I went alone, a treat to myself. I invited Kasumi, Dad, and Akane to go, but they had other priorities, unfortunately."<p>"Oh. I can't say Pops wasn't much company to travel with, but he was always there. There were times he even appreciated the scenery, not that he would blatantly let on." Ranma shrugged, and leaned back, "Sometimes, I thought I was probably the only one that really enjoyed the trip itself. I wouldn't give up the martial arts training for anything, but I don't think I would have minded to travel just for the sake of traveling."<p>"There aren't many guys that I know of that would admit to just stopping to smell the roses, Ranma," Nabiki commented, almost seeming to study Ranma's face.<p>The pigtailed girl blushed at the scruteny, before clearing her throat, "Ah, it would have just been nice for there to be an instance or two that wasn't about training, that's all."<p>Nabiki chuckled, gaining a puzzled expression from her 'date', "You're one of a kind, you know that, Ranma?" Nabiki paused, recalling something she wanted to ask, "By the way, why did you change to a girl?"<p>Ranma shifted uncomfortably in her seat.
