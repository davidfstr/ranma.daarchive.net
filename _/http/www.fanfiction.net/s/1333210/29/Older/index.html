</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki brushed her hair back, as she looked out the window to her room that gave her a view to the street running by her home. It was still early, but she had already seen many of the younger generation, dressed in their ultilitarian uniforms, striding individually or in groups to their respective schools. Many working men and women of appointed salaries made their way to the bus stops, subways, or chose to take their own vehicles as they submitted to their fate of another day in servitude. Nabiki wasn't concerned today at being at work, but it was a whole new day for her.<p>She leaned forward, almost pressing her forehead against the window, as her forearms rested on the windowstill. The smooth fabric of her silk pajama top against her flesh reminded her of the lack of undergarments beneith. Leaning away from the glass portal to the outside world, she turned to find her emerald blue panties, shimmering in the morning sunlight that was being reflected into her abode, fallen precariously next to Ranma's pants and boxers. She found the matching bra had fallen off the bed from where she had laid it last night on the foot of the bed, and After sparing the briefest glance towards the garments, her eyes found Ranma.<p>He didn't lay splayed across the bed, but as if he were expecting to share it with someone. His youthful face remained peacefully content, lacking any sign of the exertions they endured together only a few hours ago, and so endearing to her. She had covered him with the blankets from under her bed, not wanting to disturb his sleep by attempting to tuck him into the covers they both had slept on top of. Dieties, he was so beautiful to her, she didn't want to look away from him for one moment.<p>Almost subconciously, she counted the soft, drawn breaths he took in his sleep, finding the noiseless sound blissfully soothing, like the finest performing violin; reaching alluring highs and captivating lows in a relaxed tempo that quelled the anxieties of the soul, and calmed the spirit. Her arms folded over her stomach, not quite believing what had happened that night, of what she was experiencing that morning, but knowing it was too, too real to be dismissed. Walking quietly over to him, and holding her breath as if she might accidentally awaken him, Nabiki knelt down at the side of the bed, staring closer at his relaxed face. Reaching forward carefully, she brushed a wayward strand that had fallen from the side of his head to dangling across his closed eyes. The feeling that was overcoming her, it was all too new.<p>Ranma's eyes began to flutter open, while his body fought to keep from awakening; the soft matress under him, the warm covers atop of him, and the immense sense of comfort refused to relenquish him. Alas, his own internal clock would not allow his unconcious state for too much longer. It was then his mind registered that he was not in his room. The bed was too soft, while the darker colors of the painted walls also confirmed this. He was sure that he should be feeling some sense of panic, but it didn't come. When he noticed Nabiki's dark, loving eyes focusing on his, he no longer worried about where he was in the least.<p>"Good morning," Nabiki said, quietly.<p>Ranma gave her a tired but warm smile, "Morning."<p>"You don't have to worry about getting up, we did a lot last night," Nabiki said, rising to sit on the bed.<p>Ranma smiled abashed, recalling what they had done, "Yeah."<p>"I have nothing to regret, Ranma, you shouldn't either." She patted the space next to her, urging Ranma to join her at the side of the bed.<p>The pigtailed boy did so, and pleasantly surprised her with a gentle kiss on the lips, "Nabiki, I haven't had any regrets since I first met you."<p>The older woman gave a quirk of a smile, "Oh? You sure about that?"<p>Ranma snorted in gentle humor, "Sure, I might have been angry, but I never once regretted meeting you." Ranma was acutely aware he was still naked, and pulled the loose blanked around him to preserve unecessary modesty, "Well, I regret what I said to you, I regret ever hurting you in any of the ways I managed to, even if they were accidents, but with you..."<p>Nabiki didn't say anything, not trusting her voice, and allowed Ranma to continue speaking. "Hey, you know when I think I did fall in love with you?" Nabiki shook her head slightly, looking at Ranma with dew glistening eyes, "It was when I first saw that smile there," Ranma continued, pointing to the warm yet sardonic one that Nabiki's mouth custoarily fell into. "That first night, I went up to apologise to you after what I said, I know you were upset about it, but didn't think you would take what I said so hard. Heh, but you asked me if I wanted to be friends..."<p>Ranma's eyes became downcast, "No one's ever asked me to be their friend before, I always assumed they were my friends."<p>Nabiki pulled herself from the bed, and knelt before Ranma. Her glistening eyes caught ahold of Ranma's, as she gently lifted his chin with her hand. Once she had his focus on her, she rested both her hands in his lap. "Ranma, When I did ask, I really didn't think much would come from it. Most guys, unless they're family, usually wouldn't have anything to do with older women." Nabiki looked down at her hands, before she found one of Ranma's laying on top of hers. She looked back up and smiled, as she grasped onto it with both her own. "But... you've been the best friend I had ever gained. No matter what, you trusted me. Regardless of the consequences, you stayed with me. Despite everything, everything we've said or done to each other, you were there for me, and would never go away, even if I tried to force you away."<p>The emotion growing within Nabiki nearly inhibited her, yet fueled her, drove her to continue. "I hadn't ever felt this way about anyone before. In the thirty-seven years I have lived, no one has ever been so close to me as you have. Not even three months, and I love you more than I have anyone ever. Not Saito, not Miki or Jesse, not even my own family... I love you Ranma, with out a single doubt on my mind..."<p>"...will you marry me?"<p>Ranma stared, frozen and solid as granite, when the question hit him. Not a muscle within him was under his brain's command, as he seemed to blankly stare at and through the older woman. Feeling a dreaded anxiety at his lack of responce, Nabiki began babbling, "I can provide for the both of us no problem, Ranma. If you want to continue the art, teach it, fight in the streets, whatever, I don't care. If you want to go on training trips for years, I'll go with you, I'll give up everything I have right now, I'll give up my job, this house, the car, I'll... I'll..."<p>Nabiki paused, noticing the shimmering, glossiness over Ranma's eyes, before her own tears fell, and her mouth flickered into a smirk, "Ranma... are you crying?"<p>"No," Ranma quickly, but very quietly replied, "Jus' sleep in my eyes, s'all.."<p>Nabiki wasn't fooled, not even needing to catch the great strain in his voice. But before she could comment, he used his free hand to grasp the back of her head, and slowly pull the woman into a kiss. Nabiki gave the hand she held in both of hers a small squeeze to thank him; in thanks for accepting her proposal She brought her hands up to hold onto his sides, while pushing him with her lips back onto the bed. Ranma gracefully surrendered, and brought his own the now freed hand to the small of Nabiki's back. With the attenuated sound of their weight displacing air within the spaces of the mattress, they continued from last night something that would never be finished between them.<p>_<p>Shampoo blushed, as she stood by the door with a tray of food in her hands, before quietly backing away, and heading back to the kitchen. Her great-grandmother had nearly finished cleaning up from the both of them preparing breakfast for one, soon to become two, of the newest members of their family. "Do you think it is wise for us to be here?"<p>"Of course it is, child, and Japanese! You're still supposed to be learning!" Cologne chided, and spied the tray still in her daughter's hands, "I presume they're still preoccupied?"<p>Shampoo blushed again, and nodded, "They shall be busy for some time, I believe."<p>"Hmm," Cologne hummed, knowingly, "well then, put that tray in the oven, it shall remain warm there. Come, let us eat for ourselves."<p>Shampoo came to sit at the table across from her great-grandmother, and picked up her wide spoon, "Nabiki has asked for Ranma to commit... to for marriage."<p>"She asked him to marry her," Cologne corrected Shampoo, grinning broadly at the news. "Splended!" Cologne then looked to the small ceramic flask that was still on the kitchen counter. Shampoo followed her gaze, before frowning.<p>"No, Elder."<p>"Oh, I'm sure they'll understand," Cologne replied, almost flippantly, "They will even thank me, later!"<p>"It will only be of their choosing," Shampoo argued, "We shall not make their decision for them."<p>Cologne chuckled, and relented. Just a sprinkle of the flask's contents, and Nabiki and Ranma would have a... productive marriage. Quietly, they both began to eat their bowls of congee along with the deep fried devils, barely taking their first bites before...<p>"Ranma?"<p>Both Shampoo and Cologne shifted their eyes to where the surpised, but obviously pleased exclamation came from. At the beet red expression her heir wore, Cologne chuckled.<p>"Ranma must be... passionate," Shampoo finally voiced, beginning her breakfast again.<p>"Indeed," Cologne nodded, before giving her Great-granddaughter a coy smirk, "Do you see what you had missed out on?"<p>Shampoo shrugged, "Do you see what we would have missed out on, if things became different?"<p>"I suppose. But, my dear great-granddaughter, what is to become of you?"<p>Shampoo removed the spoon from her mouth, musing on the point, "I believe there are yet many others I may yet come to know..."<p>_<p>"ACHOO"<p>Rubbing his nose, the young man looked around, wondering when the large western castle upon the mountaintop surrounded by deep forest had been erected in Sapporo...<p>_<p>Blowing his nose with a hankerchief within his robe, the young man wearing thick glasses imagined his beloved Shampoo had been talking about him, obviously greatly missing him.<p>_<p>The young platnium haired man paused, but was unable to fight off his sneeze. Annoyed at the involintary bodily function, he tightened the grip on the steel briefcase in his hand, severely wishing his bodyguard was still around...<p>_<p>The Hispanic young man frowned at the spray of moisture that currently moistened his the paper on the fold down tray in front of him. He hated flying, the high altitudes wreaked havoc with his body, including his immune system.<p>Sighing, he continued working on the poem before him, writing vigerously lest his inspiration leave him. Plus, it gave him something to do during the flight to Japan.<p>_<p>"Indeed," Cologne replied, finding her heir having grown into a great deal of wisdom. In her youth, Shampoo saw a great deal more than the matriarch of the Xian family line did, as she was too set in her ways. Perhaps, because of this, Shampoo shall become one of the greatest villiage leaders in centuries.<p>_<p>Ranma could just feel Nabiki glowing, as he exited the room, wearing only the pants he had entered the room with the following night. Thanks to Nabiki's proposal and their repeat performance, the pigtailed young man was left more than a little exhausted, both physically and emotionally. Not to mention extremely famished.<p>He won. This fight, the battle he had waged well before he conciously understood what he was fighting for had finally come to a conclusion. No matter what setbacks, no matter how bleak it felt, no matter how painful the blows, he kept fighting with more perseverance than he had ever put into anything else. So tenatious, for the prize in the end had become the ost important goal of his young life, even beyond mastery of the art..<p>And in the end, Ranma always wins.<p>Marriage, Nabiki wanted to spend their lives together in the greatest of unions between a man and woman. Even Ranma was aware of the consumate vastness that came with the older woman herself proposing. She already had comfortable wealth, and she had a reletively fulfilled life before he came into it. And, as much as it would have hurt the both of them, he knew that she could continue on living it, if he were to leave. To put it bluntly, he had nothing to offer her, yet she was willing to give it all up just for his companionship. Fortunately, he had no intention of leaving her, which made his answer to her question easily evident to him.<p>To think, none of this would have ever occured to him in his furthest dreams, or from his older perspective, worst nightmares. Now, he couldn't see what his life would have been like, if they had never met. For this, he owed his father an unpayable debt, one that he would seek to fulfill... after he beat the crap out of the old man on general principle. He could not fathom how the woman became so important to him, and didn't understand why he, over time, became more and more needy of her. Perhaps that was simply the irratic way of love, or he simply became a little older, in these few months.<p>"Good morning, Son-in-Law, and congradulations!"<p>"Wha?" Ranma suddenly shifted defensively, not having forgotten yesterday's ordeal. Before him at the dining table, sat Shampoo and Cologne, both eyeing him appreciatingly. When he finally noticed their stares, he returned them with a hooded gaze, folding his arms over his chest, "What are the two of you doing here? And I ain't your Son-in-law, I don't care who won that fight!"<p>Shampoo turned to her great grandmother, "Perhaps you are right, Great Grandmother, there is to be much I shall miss." Cologne cackled at Shampoo's comment, drawing a deeper frown of confusion from Ranma.<p>"Hmm, I suppose Nabiki hadn't explained things to you," Cologne considered, finally regaining control of herself, "First of all, you are, indeed still my Son-in-Law..." Cologne favored Ranma with an amused smile, "presuming you accept my honored Great granddaughter's proposal."<p>Ranma closed his eyes, sighing deeply; exactly what part of 'There's no way in the deepest, most desolate, bowels of hell am I gonna marry Shampoo,' did the old woman not get? "Listen, you-"<p>Nabiki came around to the threshold to the kitchen, wearing the same thing she had been when Ranma left her room. "Ranma, I forgot that I hadn't put any towels in your bathroom so..." The middle aged woman paused, noticing the two unexpected guests. The silence held for several moments as Nabiki stared at both Shampoo and Cologne, before...<p>"...you'll have to take a couple out of the dryer before you go in there," Nabiki finished, before kissing a blushing Ranma on the cheek, and strode back to her room, unmindful of her nudity.<p>"You must be very proud of your fiancee'," Cologne commented, fighting to keep her face stoic after her comment. It helped, the fact that she was rather startled at the radiance from Nabiki that was most assuradly more than a simple afterglow; the elder woman decided she must ask her newest great granddaughter about that.<p>Ranma shook his head slightly, and turned from looking down the hallway back to the two Amazons, "Wha?" Cologne sighed, deciding her taunting was for naught.<p>"Great Grandmother means to tell you, I have invited Nabiki into our family, and she will be treated as such," Shampoo looked towards her Elder, before continuing, "She is a proud addition to our line, even if not part of our blood, we gladly take her as part of our honor."<p>"Wait a sec, does that mean she's gonna have to kill any girl that somehow manages to beat her?" Ranma enquired, not sure if he cared for the idea. Both Shampoo and Cologne looked at each other, nervously.<p>"That... is..." Shampoo attempted to explain...<p>"Her decision entirely," Cologne finished for her, and just hoped that if such an off-chance arrived, nobody in the villiage was to hear of it.<p>Ranma glared, sceptically, before relenting, "Alright, I guess there's no problem in that. But, um... why?"<p>Shampoo shied her eyes from the pigtailed young man, "I would never be able to accept what I had done, if I were the instrument that separates between the two of you."<p>"Boy," the matriach of the Xian family began in a low, solumn voice, "Do you truly love that woman? Truly love her beyond a shadow of a doubt or inkling of regret?"<p>Ranma bristled at her addressment, but refrained from commenting. Relaxing his expression, he allowed both Amazons to see his resolution, "There would have been nothing you could do that woulda pulled me away from her."<p>Cologne stared at Ranma for the longest time, before a slight smile crossed her face, "Good, I would hate to believe that I had failed because of stubborness. As it were, I'm satisfied that you are still marrying into my family, Son-in-law."<p>"Would you quit calling me that, I'm..." Ranma suddenly paled, "How did you know...?"<p>"Oh, you and Nabiki must be too, too hungry, allow me to retrieve your breakfast," Shampoo suddenly interjected, nearly jumping from the chair and running to the oven.<p>"Well, I need to go shower, um, first," Ranma stated, realizing the scent that still lingered on him. Not that he actually minded it, but if he were to be eating at the table with others...<p>"Yes, you do that," Cologne stated, internally relieved to get a reprieve from the not-so-flattering aroma, "As for me and Shampoo, we must depart before my Grandson misses us. He can run the restaurant alone for only so often, before even his patience becomes finite, and Shampoo still has at least the last half of her classes to attend today. Come along Shampoo, and leave these two to their privacy."<p>"Not as if you ain't invaded it enough," Ranma grumbled, before stepping aside, and allowing the Amazons to pass.<p>"Bye, brother-in-law!" Shampoo gave in passing, causing Cologne to chuckle.<p>Ranma turned to watch the two uninvited guests leave, marveling a their change in attitude, and frowned, "Hmph, you'd think that this is already done, the way those two were acting..."<p>"Why, having second thoughts?"<p>Ranma quickly whirled, finding Nabiki standing behind him in a towel. "Ah, aren't you concerned they might see you again?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, "It's not as if they hadn't seen me skyclad already, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed boy relented at the point, though wondered at Nabiki's shamelessness, "I'm gonna go shower, too. I'm a little... ah..."<p>Nabiki smirked at his embarrassment, "I know what you mean. I forgot I have a couple of appointments at work today, so you're going to be home by yourself for the time being... sorry."<p>Ranma couldn't help but feel disappointed, but understood the importance, "It's not a big deal, I mean, we can, um, after you get back, right?"<p>Nabiki's smirk turned catty, "My, aren't we insatiable?"<p>"What? WHAT? I mean... not that, well I wanna do that but, I mean only if you want to, and... I was just wanting to hang out with you, unless you WANT to do... um... it again I'm happy... not that I..."<p>Laughing, the older woman approached Ranma, and silenced him with a kiss. After a few moments, she pulled away, "We'll do something special later, okay? Promise."<p>Ranma nodded, already anxious for what will happen later. He jolted, suddenly feeling himself being dragged by Nabiki, "Hey, wha?"<p>"You needed a shower, remember?" Nabiki stated, as she made her way to her room with Ranma in tow.<p>"Yeah, but I can't get to the bathroom if you're holding onto me!"<p>"No sense in wasting water, Ranma-hon."<p>"Um... don't you need to shower more than me. I mean if you have to be somewhere soon."<p>"Yup."<p>Ranma finally clicked onto what was being implied, "Nabiki, isn't the shower in your room kinda... small?"<p>"Definitely small," she replied factually, as she opened the door to her bedroom, "much smaller than the main bathroom's."<p>"Um, Nabiki..."<p>"Yes?"<p>Ranma shook his head, and smiled in surrender, as he closed the door from the hallway, "Nevermind."<p>_<p>Ranma sat on the living room couch, at a loss for what to do. He could be forgiven for his lack of consideration of activities, as his mind was securely rooted on him, Nabiki, and what had happened between them last night.<p>The things she had shown him, how she had opened herself fully to him... there were no words that fit description. He couldn't imagine feeling as he did for Nabiki to anyone else, it was like his whole life was leading to simply finding her, and finishing a puzzle that his birth left uncompleted.<p>Was there a way he could ever truly express his feelings? He surely couldn't think of anything. He was sure she could ask him to do anything, and he would barely show hesitation if it was what she truly wanted. He also couldn't stand the thought of hurting her in any way. The night before last, as they bounded from rooftop to rooftop, and he had seen the world of agony and anger in her face, it did more than simply cause him to freeze up. It was like the world, within and about, had shattered into oblivion. Like he had failed so utterly in something so important that he was unredeemable; no form of penance would ever suffice. The more he thought about it, the more he realized there was just so much he needed to make up to her.<p>Tiring of simply sitting on the couch, Ranma absently stood, and wandered the house. Every inch of it was imbued with her presence. Her style, her charm, and her personality decorated it as much as the black wireframe style spiral stairsway and the mature, soft, earthy colors everything was decorated in. Her intelligence, cool reservation, and calm demeanor was stated in the almost spartan furnishings that he knew were exorbitantly expensive in each their own right. How she simply required the best, but didn't seem enticed to have the best of everything reflected in the subtle eloquence left by the open space that was every so often broken by the couch, TV, and end and hall tables. What he enjoyed so much about all of it, was he felt welcome in it, inviting more than simply as a guest, but like it was requesting he always be a part of it.<p>Now, there was not a single room closed to him, he had free access to anywhere within that Nabiki walked uninhibited. The openness now almost yearned for his contribution; silently asking him to add his own personality, charm, style, quirk, and taste to fill it. Ranma didn't have anything to offer it, just as he felt for its owner, but appreciated the comforting sense of belonging it now freely bestowed upon him.<p>Nabiki's scent hit him almost immidiately, before he realized he was actually entering her room. One of her private abodes that had felt completely off-limits to him unless invited, it now felt as if he were granted unquestionable permission. In unconcious reaction, he inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady, perfumed aroma he knew belonged to only one woman. His eyes immidiately fell on the dishevaled bed, and he felt his face flush in memory. He wasn't too sure how often they were supposed to do... what they did last night, and he didn't want to seem like some sort of letch by enquiring about it, so that left him hoping that she was eager to initiate things as much as possible.<p>Ranma sat onthe unmade bed, left so by the rush Nabiki made to get to work that morning. Smirking wryly, the pigtailed young man knew she wouldn't have had to hurry so much if they hadn't lingered in the shower for so long. It wasn't a three-peat of activities that started at night, and were began again when they woke up, but it certainly proved its own sensual experience. And the way Nabiki had been moaning from him washing her back, he presumed the difference between activities were almost minimal.<p>Laying back onto the bed, he sighed, wondering how he could feel so content, while knowing intellectually of the answer. He then frowned, wondering when he had become so... so... as his father would no doubt put it, 'girly'.<p>'Heh, screw the old man,' Ranma thought, he was pretty sure that one person thought he was more than manly enough. Ranma laid on the soft mattres that was infused with Nabiki's presence, before considering exactly what he could do that day. With that in mind, he left Nabiki's room, intent on heading to the Cat Cafe.<p>_<p>Nabiki ignored the stares around her, as she seemed to watch the coffee perculator with more than passing interest. She could hardly fault their stares, considering the way she was acting; it wasn't everyday you got to see your usually reserved boss acting like a glowing teenager who just lost her virginity. Or, more precise, a middle aged woman who just claimed the virginity of a boy less than half her age.<p>Nabiki fought the urge to cackle triumphantly and shout, "He's mine, MINE!" since it was a bit mellowdramatic, and the humore would be lost on her associates. Instead, she retrieved the now full pot of coffee from the perculator, and turned to the other employees in the breakroom who were watching her curiously, "And is everyone enjoying their breaks?"<p>After several blinks, everyone nodded in unison, earning a beeming smile from Nabiki. Pouring herself a cup full, she waved to everyone, and strode back for her office. Sure, it was unbecoming of her to be this giddy, but she couldn't help it. She was sure the more observative people had put two and two together, judging from the way Charles had been watching her with a coy smirk, but she didn't care much of their opinion at the moment.<p>She and Ranma now had their whole lives before them, and it would be together that they faced it all. His acceptance was better than could ever be put into words, and Nabiki was arguably the happiest woman in the world. She knew now, no matter what, there was nothing that would take Ranma from her... nothing.<p>Well, there was that teensy problem with a suicide pact and a gender-bending curse; it was best they talk with Nodoka about that soon. Not that anything would become of it, Nabiki assured herself, since she would have the woman arrested if push comes to shove. It would upset Ranma quite a bit, she was sure, but he would eventually forgive her for looking out for his best interests. Then again, Nabiki was prety sure that Ranma's mother COULD be resonable sometimes. As much as the woman seemed to be hung on her son being manly, well, heh heh... Nabiki can attest to that well enough.<p>Even if that was the main problem, it was far from the only one. Kasumi wasn't too keen on her sister's affection for someone who had just graduated from being a minor, but Nabiki figured that she would only be enstranged from her eldest sister for a couple of years before Kasumi got used to the idea. Akane, on the other hand... well they could probably slide for a while without her finding out. Nabiki loved her youngest sister to death, but Akane had that rather irritating issue with being impulsive, and the idea of actually having to kill Akane to stop her blind rampage didn't sit too well with her.<p>Their father would no doubt be estatic about all this, which makes things a bit easier. Sure he was senile, but it still mattered his opinion to Nabiki. Well, also her former and her current Brother in laws would hear about it. Tofu would probably not have any qualms about it, which was reasuring, and Thomas would probably not care too much, and wish her the best. The latter would also give the added bonus of keeping her little sister in check, in case word did get back to Akane.<p>In the end, it would all be inconsequential. She had Ranma, and that was all there was to it. Kasumi nor Akane had much say in the matter.<p>Not even noticing the little tune she was humming to herself, Nabiki opened the door to her office, and stopped at the sight of Shampoo sitting at her desk, playing her Wonderswan, and Charles sitting on the loveseat on the side of her office, chatting with Ranma like they were the best of friends.<p>"Uh, hello everyone," Nabiki greeted, curious about the visit, and exactly what the two men were discussing.<p>Shampoo looked up with an irritated expression, "You erased my game."<p>Nabiki smiled, chagrinned; that had been one of her more petty moments, when she was a bit irritated with Shampoo, "Sorry, it had been an accident. You can borrow it if you like to catch up, you were only two hours in anyhow." Shampoo snorted, but went back to playing.<p>Nabiki then turned to Ranma and Charles, smiling brightly at them, more specifically Ranma, in greeting. "Ah, Nabiki," the Frenchman returned, "This young man had been explaining to me his stay with you as his father was abroad. He is quite appreciative of your hospitality."<p>"Oh?" Nabiki quirked, "And what else have you two been talking about?" Ranma shrugged, before staring Nabiki directly in the eye, and shaking his head subtly. letting the woman know that he hadn't revealed anything to the other man of what was between them.<p>"The boy has told me he is a martial artist," Charles explained, before looking over to Ranma to confirm his next comment, "I believe he is of the same form as you?"<p>"Somewhat, we just have different family styles," Nabiki explained, before striding up to Ranma, "Hey hon, thanks for the visit."<p>Charles blinked, as Nabiki wrapped her arms around Ranma's neck, and leaned down to the sitting boy to extract a kiss. It wasn't a light, friendly peck, but neither was it a long, ostentatious one. It was just enough to let Ranma know how much Nabiki appreciated his presence.<p>Shampoo had looked up, just in time to see Nabiki leaning down, before pausing the handheld game, walking up to the door to the office, and glaring at several people who were looking in with raised eyebrows, and a couple looking on with distain. After causing the majority of them to turn away, pretending to mind their own business, Shampoo shut the door.<p>Charles stepped away, attempting regain some composure, as Nabiki broke away from a madly grinning Ranma, and over to her desk. Taking her seat, she handed the approaching Shampoo the Wonderswan, and motioned her to the seat at the front of the desk. "So, what brings you two here?"<p>"Ranma just want to come visit, but did not know where your office was," Shampoo explained.<p>"I was kinda getting bored sitting at home," Ranma continued, attempting to casually shrug off his grin.<p>"Ah, well it's nice to have you here, Ranma-hon."<p>"Um... is this the young man who was currently attending school?" Charles enquired, now realizing how underexaggurated his presumption had originally been.<p>Nabiki nodded, "Isn't he cute?"<p>Charles eyed Ranma, causing the pigtailed boy to involintarily take a couple of steps away and cover himself by crossing his arms over his chest. Charles chuckled at Ranma's reaction, "Most endearingly so. I compliment you on your bold taste, my dear."<p>"Just remember, he's mine," Nabiki countered, smiling. Both Ranma and Shampoo blinked, and looked at each one another for explanation.<p>"Indeed," the French native responded in mirth, before turning back to Ranma, "Though a young man such as yourself should have... many experiences..."<p>"CHARLES."<p>Shampoo stared at Nabiki, surprised at the outburst, before suddenly catching on, and snapping a surprised stare at Charles, "Aiyaa..."<p>"What? Something wrong?" Ranma equired, also surprised by Nabiki.<p>"If you don't mind, Charles, I'm sure you have some work to do?" Nabiki enquired, making a thinly vieled threat. She wouldn't mind getting off early, if Charles was willing to stay a bit longer, thus 'volenteering'.<p>"Of course, I do have a great deal," Charles hastefully stated, before smirking, "Though I expect we will talk later?"<p>Nabiki smiled, "Count on it." With a nod, the Frenchman left the office, almost causing several people listening at the door to tumble foward.<p>Afer the door was shut, Nabiki's expression grew somewhat serious, "Ranma, I think there's something we might want to take care of today."<p>"Huh?"<p>Nabiki looked down at the almost finished stack of paperwork on her desk, "After I'm done here, how about we go visit your mother?"<p>_<p>Ranma watched the cityview pass by through the car's window, hiding what little nervousness he felt. He was completly sure his mother would be estatic about the news; she was just loopy that way. He could also imagine the back-handed commentary that would soon follow. That, in turn would put Nabiki in a bad mood, meaning he would suffer the consequences of her ire. He had come to the conclusion he had rather liked Nabiki smiling, happy, and cheerful. So, the question that repeated in his mind happened to be.<p>"Are you sure this is a good idea?"<p>Nabiki shifted her eyes to Ranma for a second from the road, "Ranma, for the... twelth time... that was the twelth time you've asked, right?" At Ranma's glare, Nabiki stifled a chuckle, and continued, "You're mother's going to flip when we tell her the news."<p>"Well,Ii didn't think you would be in such a hurry to tell everyone," Ranma almost groused, managing to check his attitude an instant before the words left his mouth.<p>"Ranma, I'm not going to fight it anymore. I'm not waiting for the second shoe to drop, alright?"<p>"Uh, yeah, but-"<p>"Ranma, I've been the biggest problem between us," Nabiki interrupted, "Not anymore."<p>"It just seems like you're, well, overcompensating."<p>Nabiki remained silent for several moments, causing Ranma to shift nervously. She seemed to focuse more on the road, though he was pretty sure she was trapped in thought. He didn't think he had said anything that would upset her, but simply did not want to take any chances. With a sigh, he turned an apologetic expression to Nabiki, "I'm sorry, it's just that... I'm just a bit, well..."<p>"Am I making you that uncomfortable, Ranma?"<p>The pigtailed young man ceased in trying to find the words to explain himself, "Huh?" Nabiki continued to stare ahead, but her tight lipped expression was enough to relay her current vunerable state. "No, no, it's not you, alright? I'm just not sure we should do this now."<p>"Ranma, you love your mother, right?" Nabiki asked, right out of the blue, "Even if you were gone for ten years from her."<p>Ranma opened his mouth to say the first thing that came to mind, before he rethought his answer, "Yeah, I do. I mean she may be batty, and a little more than a bit on the flipside if she married Pop, but she is my Mom."<p>"It's been almost thirty years since my mother died," Nabiki stated, wistfully. Ranma nodded slowly in condolences, allowing her to continue, "I still miss her sometimes, wondering what she would do in my place, if she would agree with some of the decisions I've made throughout my life..." Nabiki pulled off onto an exit, reducing her speed to safely navigate the turn off, "...wondering if she would approve of how I feel about you."<p>"I thought you said you don't have any-" Ranma began, feeling an all too familiar and very unwelcome anxiety creep up on him.<p>"She would be happy for me, Ranma. If she could see what had come between us, I know I'd have her blessings... and I probably do now."<p>"I... don't follow."<p>Nabiki's mouth stretched into a smile, heralding her returning humor, "Ranma, if necessary, I'd pay to have the announcement billboarded in the middle of the Ginza. Anyone has a problem with it, I don't care. But..."<p>Nabiki trailed off for a few moments, gathering herself to convey her complete sincerity, "...there is something else that we need to do, and it would be best to get this out of the way as soon as possible."<p>"What are you talking about?"<p>"Ranma, I'm not going to lose you, one way or the other," Nabiki stated in a firm, but cryptic manner, "If you ever had a reason to trust me, now would be the time to use it." Ranma knew she wouldn't say anymore, and turned to continue watching the scenery that passed them by.<p>_<p>Nodoka opened the door, and her eyes lit up in gleeful, "Ranma, Nabiki, Welcome! I had not been expecting you until later."<p>Nabiki nodded a slight bow, "Mrs. Saotome." After her greeting, she looked up to Ranma, who was nervously scowering his surroundings. Surrupticiously, she wrapped her arm around his waist, barely hiding it from his mother.<p>Nodoka proved perceptive, and if she hadn't caught the fingertips creeping around Ranma's side, she most assuradly noted their proximity to one another. Blinking a few times, she withheld her coy grin at their subtle displays of affection towards one another; she had already been informed by Nabiki the gravity of their relationship, but it still did her heart joy to see its proof. "You had something important to tell me?" Nodoka asked, feigning obliviousness. "Oh, where are my manners, please, enter, and I shall prepare us some tea, and perhaps a few snacks."<p>Nabiki nodded curtly, and gently urged Ranma with her, as she followed Nodoka inside. Both visitors sat at the living room table that would provide as their tea table, while the matronly woman scurried off to the kitchen. It wasn't long before she returned with the tea and red bean wagashi.<p>As Nodoka sat down, she began pouring the tea, "So, this grand announcement you felt so urgent?"<p>"I'm pretty sure you have an idea," Nabiki replied in a sardonic tone, while leaning tighter against Ranma. The pigtailed young man blushed, and looked down at the table. Looking up at Ranma, Nabiki gave in to a small urge, and pecked him on the cheek.<p>"I'm afraid you do me too much credit," Nodoka replied, simply, as she handed each of them a cup of tea.<p>Nabiki blinked, trying to figure out exactly how Nodoka had kept a straight face when she said that, while Ranma sputtered in surprise. Silently chuckling to herself, Nabiki leaned her head against Ranma's shoulder, "Me and Ranma have formally accepted the engagement."<p>"That's nice, dear, but that wasn't for you to decide." Nodoka replied almost flippantly, "After all, it was a matter of honor, you were honorbound in your engagement."<p>Nabiki caught the subtle refrained smirk from the other woman, before hers grew, "Indeed, maybe it was also just fate that we could not argue against?"<p>Nodoka was unable to hold back her mirth, "Perhaps." Ranma looked between the two women he loved, wondering exactly what he had missed. Suddenly, Nodoka was leaning forward, clasping the hand Nabiki left on the table with both of hers, "Oh! This is such great news! I had hopes for the both of you, but I sincerely didn't expect this."<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Saotome..."<p>"Please, call me mother."<p>"Um... no," Nabiki replied, still smiling. Nodoka pouted a few moments, before returning to her serene smile. Nabiki took a sip of her tea, before she felt sufficiently calm enough to continue, "There is, one other matter to discuss."<p>"Oh, there will be enough times to discuss the ceremony later. We-"<p>"No, not that," Nabiki replied in a solumn tone. She turned and looked at Ranma, who was staring back at her curiously. Turning back to Nodoka, Nabiki continued, "I'm sure you recall the exchange student that had been staying with me, Rachael?"<p>"Um, yes," Nodoka replied, a bit taken back by the insistant change of subject, "What of her?"<p>Ranma had began to pale right before Nabiki's eyes, and she grasped onto his left hand with her right, and gently squeezed. His panicked eyes met hers, reading the message plainly spoken to him without words, 'trust me'.<p>Nabiki stood up, and headed for the kitchen. Ranma's blood ran colder, as the sound of running water reached his ears. In an all too short time for him, Nabiki returned, with a glass in her hand. "I am afraid I must... we must apologise for the deception, but you must understand that it was of great prudence."<p>"Deception?" Nodoka echoed, finding herself swallowed up by the sudden seriousness.<p>Nabiki sat back next to Ranma, and set the glass on the table, "First, i want you to know that I love Ranma, unhibitedly, and unconditionally. Nothing that has happened, or that can happen, will change that." Nabiki's eyes grew hard and glaring, "I also will not allow anything to happen to him, no matter what... or who is the one that imposes the threat."<p>"That... nice to hear, but what is this all about?"<p>Nabiki reached for the glass, "Nodoka, your son is the most honorable, dedicated, and outstanding man I have ever known, and despite our age difference, I will gladly call him my husband..." Ranma braced himself, as he felt he unsettling sensations shift through him. Opening his eyes, he found himself looking up to Nabiki, before closing them in reaction to the kiss she visited upon him.<p>Nodoka stared in shock, as Nabiki parted from a dreamily dazed teenaged redheaded girl's lips. Nabiki then wrapped her arms around Ranma, and pulled the girl into her protectively, "...in any form."<p>Nodoka gaped for several moments, before finally squeeking out her voice, "Ran... Rachael?"<p>Ranma gave a timid smile, "H-hi... mom."<p>Nabiki tightened her hold on Ranma, feeling the trembles moving through her body. Nabiki faltered for a moment, wondering if this had indeed happened too fast. She firmed her resolve, kissing Ranma on the back of her head. She then stared defiantly at Nodoka, daring her to any act that she would make the woman pay for... gravely.<p>Nodoka regained her composure, and made her move, "Now that that's all settled, you simply must try the snacks! I had found this recipe on the internet."<p>Ranma was unfortunate in having to provide a cushion for Nabiki's face fault.
