</div>'Older'<p>"Damn it, Ranma! That's NOT what I want from you! I don't NEED you to change!" Nabiki's tears held Ranma's gaze, as he felt his will beginning to falter, "I need you..."<p>Ranma's smirk faltered, as he closed his eyes, "I'm... I'm not leaving you... I just gotta think about things, alright?"<p>"No..." Nabiki whispered. She heard what he had said, but she couldn't bring herself to believe it.<p>"I... I gotta go." With that, the pigtailed boy used all the strength he could muster, and broke from Nabiki, taking to the rooftops.<p>This was the hardest thing he had ever had to do. It took every iota of his being not to turn back around, every ounce of his soul not to take what he knew would be the selfish path, but no matter what, he continued to run as if the Hells were enclosing on him.<p>His lungs burned from putting what little energy he had left into his mad sprint across the rooftops, aiming to outrun anyone that may try to follow him. He didn't even know where he was heading, it was just one direction out of many...<p>One of many directions from the only thing that seemed to matter in his life, now.<p>It wasn't fair! Why did things have to be so damn complicated? He had simply hoped that he just didn't understand many things from his lack of experience, that he was the only one that felt these things were going on. Akane knew, and had shouted it out to the world, and if she knew, it was a safe bet that the others figured it out, too.<p>His eyes stung from the hot tears that unmercifully washed them, and his ragged gasps were the only things keeping his choking sobs at bay. If he had the mind to consider it, he would scoff at himself for crying. Guys don't cry...<p>No, Nabiki had told him different, Shampoo had told him different. It didn't make him weak in the least, but he still felt like he was letting her down, and failing completely.<p>The blur of unrecognizable lights receeded into an equally unrecognizable enviorment, as the last ebbs of the pigtailed martial artists stamina began to dwindle. He finally came to a stop, collapsing to his hands and knees. Tiredly, he pushed himself to seating, gulping for breath. He could have easily maintained oxygen that whole flight, even after such a difficult battle with Nabiki's youngest sister, but he had been too busy fighting the urge to just break down, and give into the pain that was growing, the further he went.<p>Think... he had gotten away to think. He needed to sort things over, think of where it was going to go wrong, and hopefully head it off before it proved the nail in the coffin. Gods, why was it coming to this? Why was he getting the bum's end? There should have been NOTHING in the way, absolutely NOTHING. Unfortunately, the problem was always there, just invisible in a shroud of idealism, disguised in a cloak of optimism.<p>It was reality.<p>The reality that would suddenly, and abruptly reveal itself like the evil being it was; stealing away dreams and happiness, simply because it existed. The reality was that he had worked so hard in turning Nabiki to his affections, that she was completely consumed in her newfound dedication. He loved her for her independance, he loved her for her individuality. He didn't know what he could do, if she was so willing to give that up for him.<p>That was a slap in the face that stung with the pain of a thousand burning needles all over his body, a blow centered within his heart. No longer caring if he was manly or weak, Ranma gave in to the overwhelming torrents that drowned out hope. For the rest of that night, Ranma would cry.<p>For because of love, he would have to give it all up.<p>_<p>Nodoka hummed softly to herself, pleased at what the future held, though she certainly hoped her son and his fiancee quickly moved to capitalize on their relationship; it wasn't as if they had much time at one end.<p>She finished the dishes used to make and serve a single meal to herself, wishing that her son, and even her wayward husband would be there to sample meals she had honed to an elloquent art since the beginning of their absence.<p>It was well past her usual hour to retire, yet she didn't have anything of importance for the next day. in a rare indulgence that called against her prudence, Nodoka turned on her small stereo system, allowing the soft, yet riveting presence of Giuseppe Verindi's 'Ave Maria' to permeate her home, as she headed for the main bathroom to prepare herself a bath. Her preperations were interrupted by the ringing of her telephone.<p>"Dear, at such a late hour," Nodoka groaned, before making a detour to her phone. "Hello?"<p>"This I would believe to be the residence of Nodoka Saotome?"<p>Nodoka blinked, not recognizing the voice, "You would be correct. My I enquire as to whom this may be?"<p>"I apologise for this rather late call, but the situation is most dire. I am Khun Lon, you may misprononce it as you will, I will take no offense."<p>"Very well, Miss Khun Lon," Nodoka replied, remaining formal and polite, regardless of her current irritation, "Though I am unfamiliar with you, you claim there is a situation that grievously reflects upon me?"<p>"Yes, though more directly your son, Ranma Saotome."<p>Nodoka nearly dropped the phone, "Wh-what happened? Is he okay? Please swear to me no harm has come to him!"<p>"I... cannot truthfully answer that, but physically I do not think he has suffered, yet time may change that, lest we are unable to find him, and soon."<p>"What has happened?" Nodoka fretted, twisting her fingers nervously within her telephone cord. She had just had her son returned to her recently, and the very thought that he could be lost again shook her heavily. The mere fact that she was forcing herself not to realize the full impact of the ordeal was the only thing keeping her from breaking down to near hysteria.<p>"What has transpired is best left told until after we have located Ranma. Lest to say I do not believe that he parted with Ms. Tendou in the most stable of states. We are currently scouring the city for his wearabouts, I had hoped that contacting you may yeild his wearabouts, but I see that my hopes were in vain."<p>"I'll do my part, please, if you could call me whenever possible? I will check my answering machine when I return."<p>"Good luck in your part of the search, Mrs. Saotome. It will take all the fortune our ancestors and dieties can provide us, if we are to be successful."<p>"I wish you well, but it's best we continue this later." Nodoka didn't bother to listen to the departing reply from the other end, as she quickly walked to her door, grabbing a convenient cloak, before she departed her home in earnest.<p>_<p>The winds still managed to meander between the brick, wood, and steel constructs that sprung from Tokyo's ground, gently seeking to cleanse whatever they touched with their delicate caress. No matter how hard they could blow, or how consoling they may be in their natural aesthetic charm, the winds could not cleanse the heaviness of the heart of one young man.<p>The light gust tenderly kissed the bangs across his forehead, stirring him with their ticklish insistance. Raising his head from his knees, his eyes remained bleary from sleep and soreness brought on by the aftermath of unrelenting emotions, yet they could see clearly the rising dawn before him.<p>The majestic splash of color that subtly shifted from dim to vibrant in a vertical span could awe even the most emotionally stringent heart, sway even the most stoic countenance, but the undisputed beauty of the sun gracing the Tokyo skyline with the splender of it's radiance was lost on the pigtailed young man. Lost as his hope.<p>No matter what, something got in the way. When things looked up, they stumbled into a chasm. Ranma's courtship of Nabiki had more obstacles than a classic trajedy, with trials more potent than even those Hercules braved. Yet, stubbornly, persistantly, Ranma endured, never letting go of the woman he loved. Now, he had come to consider, perhaps each obstacle was fate's way of warning them?<p>As Ranma sat up from the brick wall he had been leaning against; his back protesting avidly it's night long treatment. On the budding of a new day, Ranma felt like it was the end of everything he had known. He couldn't simply go back to the way things were before he knew Nabiki, because he more than simply knew her now. Everywhere he would go, he would carry her in his heart. No matter where he went, her presence without her substance would haunt him madly.<p>He was struck at a loss of what to do. The obvious path he saw now was to disappear from her life, glad to have at least known and loved her. It was the road he had already began to sprint down during the night, and now was refreshed to continue on. Or, he could return, face what was now his greatest fear, being the one who instigates it out of pure selfishness.<p>"This sucks," Ranma understated, running his fingers through his windswept bangs. Now in daylight, his mind wasn't as clearly made up as it was the previous twighlight. He finally decided, and turned back in the direction he believed he came from.<p>_<p>"DAMN YOU, RANMA!" Ryoga shouted, demanding his rival immidiately appear. He had been searching all night, as well as the others, but it was simply as if Ranma had disappeared.<p>"May as well have," Ryoga mumbled to himself, as he paused to look around. The city was still around him, that was a good sign so far, of couse, he wasn't all that sure what city he was in, that was bad.<p>As his wont, the fanged boy cursed Ranma for the ills of the world, and damned him for his cowardice. Yet, as often as he had done it, he never felt as much distain for his pigtailed nemesis as he had now.<p>Honestly, Ryoga didn't see what a woman with such high class would find in an obnoxious, arrogant jerk as Ranma, and he definitely didn't see why she would go to pieces over him leaving. But he couldn't mistake the sudden loss she radiated, understanding the sensation probably more intimately than anyone else that had been present. He had at that moment felt an obligation to track down the idiot, beat him senseless, and demand he apologise to the woman for his crimes against her. Actually, it wasn't much different than how he usually felt whenever he decided Ranma was the big problem, but it really did feel much more personal.<p>Ryoga liked Nabiki, he just couldn't help it, not that he would ever have a reason to dislike her. She was always nice to him, regardless of her subtle accusations of who might have started incidents between him and Ranma. She didn't deserve the grief the bastard gave her, and so help him...<p>"SO HELP ME, RANMA, I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO NABIKI!"<p>"Young man, you know of my son?"<p>"Huh?" Ryoga turned around, finding a vaguely familiar woman, looking back at him expectantly; her youthful complextion marred with creases from whatever current agitation she was experiencing.<p>After a moments contemplation, the copper haired woman tilted her head, "My, I believe I do know you from somewhere, aren't you one of my son's friends?"<p>Ryoga blinked, sorting through his mind where he had seen this woman before, pairing her with Ranma, until he came across a somewhat recent memory that also concerned Nabiki...<p>Which in turn caused him to erupt into a violent nosebleed, coupled with him passing flat out.<p>Nodoka baulked at the sudden reaction, before fretting, and pulling out a hankerchief.<p>_<p>Of course, he couldn't stay away.<p>The first place he had to go, was back home. The place he now knew to be the only place he had ever *lived*, the abode that belonged to the woman that he couldn't help but remain enamored to. He half-expected Nabiki's house to be swarming with people hunting for him, but it strangely it was quiet.<p>A notable absence was Nabiki's car, Ranma had forgotten, or perhaps not thought of the fact, that Nabiki worked that day. He couldn't help but feel hurt at the thought that she carried on, just mere hours after their separation. He wouldn't blame her, he was the one that left, and he left so she could very well go to work, continue to have a successful career, keep her comfortable lifestyle, and not worry about her own face in the scruteny of others. As much as he insisted that to be the case, the reason sounded more hollow than the void that housed the stars.<p>He looked down from the top of her roof, staring into the backyard, and imagining her moving through her morning practice. Before his eyes, he swore there was a ghost that reflected her presence, moving with an etheral beauty and accomplished grace of one who had taken their teachings to heart. She may not have been anywhere near as dedicated as him in the art, but he loved her for what she had gained in her training nonetheless. The pigtailed martial artist sat down, as he had many mornings before he had to go to school. Her motions had been as beautiful and as enrapturing as her sincere smile, and it always took a great deal of his own willpower to pull himself away, often not before finding himself considerably late. Just as mysteriously as it came, Nabiki's spectral image faded like the mist before the early sun.<p>::SPLASH!::<p>"OH! Ranma-chan! I thought you had left a poor old man to be alone in his twightlight years!"<p>Ranma's reaction was automatic, and more violent than ever, "DAMN IT, OLD MAN! I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS!"<p>Right as Ranma's fist was about to impact with the old man lodged between her breasts. Happosai suddenly pulled himself away, and Ranma then found herself on her back against the roof.<p>"Why don't you take a load off, kiddo?" Happosai suggested, not sounding in any way as if it were simply a suggestion.<p>Ranma found she couldn't move, "What did you do to me, you old freak?"<p>The ancient martial artist sat down next to the pigtailed young woman's head, "You disappointed me back there, Ranma."<p>The redhead's face changed from angry to somber, "Yeah, well I'm disappointed in myself, too."<p>The old man sighed, and began to withdraw his pipe. After a moment's thought, he left it in his gi, "Nabiki's like the granddaughter I never had, she's the closest thing to family I can recall. Do you know what you did to her last night?"<p>Ranma didn't answer, choosing to stare up at the sky.<p>"I guess you do," Happosai continued, "You're not planning on breaking a promise, are you?"<p>"I already have," Ranma murmured.<p>Happosai caught the reply, but didn't acknowledge it, "You said you wee only needing to think things out, you're not planning on leaving the dear girl, are you?"<p>Ranma shifted her eyes towards the old martial artist, never before hearing such... despair from his voice. Happosai was afraid, afraid for Nabiki, maybe even afraid for Ranma. "Wouldn't it be for the best?" the pigtailed girl asked, completely unsure of the answer.<p>"Everyone else is out turning Tokyo upside down looking for you, you know that, boy? But you know what? I decided that my nightly rounds were more important, and came back early enough to wait for you to show up."<p>"What makes you think I was going to... going to stay?"<p>"You told her that you just needed to think things though. We both already know what everyone wants in this whole ordeal, so there's not much to think about."<p>"How about what would happen to her if I did stay? Let's not kid ourselves, you old freak, I'm not important enough for her to-"<p>"YOU'RE IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR HER!"<p>Ranma couldn't flinch from the powerful reaction, "Whatever."<p>"Don't you 'whatever' me, you little puke! If there's one thing Nabiki finally deserves, is her own happiness. Even if she has to find it in a wetnosed, arrogant, upstart bratling like you! I won't stand by and let you destroy one of the best people I've met in my long, long life because you have an inferiority complex!"<p>"Damn it, it ain't about me!"<p>"Then who's it about?" Happosai countered, "You *are* the center of the problem, like it or not! How about you drop the 'selfless idiot' act, and go with what you both know you want, each other?"<p>"Because... because I... it's not that easy, alright? She's better off without me, and we all know it's true! I didn't need her sister to knock that fact into me, either! Did you see her? She IS dependant on me, and I'm just not capable of carrying her like she wants me to!"<p>"You think she's now going to be utterly dependant on you? HA! For someone with insecurity problems, you sure are an arrogant punk!" Happosai settled down, realizing he was becoming a bit more emotional than he wanted. "Listen here, Nabiki was doing fine when you came, I don't doubt she would do fine if you left, but she would do her best if you stayed!"<p>"I want to believe that, I... I really do," Ranma said, sadly. Happosai's words were convincing, but they just sounded too easy to simply give into, "It can't be that easy."<p>Happosai sighed once again, "I guess I can't convince you, myself. Why don't you stick around for a bit, at least talk to a few others about this. Believe me when I say this is something not to take lightly. She's been hurt before, much in the way you're about to, and trust me when I say that you'll be much worse off than that other punk."<p>Ranma closed her eyes, "What do you think they'll have to say to me? I doubt any of them would want to exactly talk with me, right now. And I ain't exactly interested in talking with anyone about this."<p>"Please, as someone who c... c..." Happosai took a deep breath, and utilized all of his dicipline to continue, "...c-c-cares for her... the both of you, as family..."<p>Ranma would have found the way Happosai was fighting from convulsing humorous, if not for the current circumstance.<p>"... anyone who knows her, that's all I wish. If you aren't convinced, I'll even help you make a clean break, that fair?"<p>"I don't need your help."<p>"Take it, because if you don't, I'll also be the first one to find you, wherever you go."<p>Happosai leapt away, leaving Ranma still paralized, and pondering his cryptic departing statement.<p>_<p>Ranma stood on the training hall of the Tendou home, hesitant to continue down into the yard. Of course they would all demand he go back to Nabiki, not that he hadn't been seriously considering it for the past day. It had taken a good two hours for Happosai's shiatsu to wear off, and during that time the redheaded martial artist had taken the time to think about what the old martial artist had said. More out of benefit of the doubt than anything, Ranma hesitatingly decided to take his advice.<p>Nabiki's father had returned, he seemed a good place to start as any. Unfortunately, there were three people around that Ranma didn't exactly wish to come into contact with right now. His father was most likely still mooching from the Tendous, and the pigtailed martial artist was more inclined to beat his old man into a coma than listen to any reprimand concening 'family honor', given his mood. Kasumi and Akane... were self explanitory, and Ranma would rather avoid them at all costs.<p>His arms draped over his knees as they were tucked to his chest, Ranma continued his survelance, at a loss for what to do now. Truthfully, the only ones he had seen in the house in fleeting glances were Akane, Kaoru, a few boys, and the American who he recalled as Akane's husband, who had just exited the house to sit on the back porch.<p>Ranma shifted a bit to get a better look, as the Native American man set one of the two cans he had been carrying with him by his side, and opened the other. He took a drink from it, and stared off into distance for a while. Finding nothing of interest for the time being, Ranma began to stand, and leave.<p>"Before you leave, why do you not come and visit for a little while?"<p>It took Ranma a moment to realize that it was him being addressed. Looking down, he saw the man staring upt at him expectantly. "What?"<p>Thomas beckoned Ranma to join him, and after seeing the hesitancy within the pigtailed young man, he spoke again, "No one will disturb us. Sit with me for a beer and a conversation." Still, hesistant, Thomas sighed, "My wife knows you are here, but she is avoiding you."<p>"Ah..." Ranma replied, more startled at being noticed, "Is Mr. Tendou around?"<p>The foreigner shook his head, "He had left with Mr. and Mrs. Saotome earlier. I am unsure where."<p>Ranma finally came down, and looked around to ensure that Akane indeed was not present. "So, mom finally came and got Pop?"<p>Thomas chuckled, tossing the second can to Ranma. The pigtailed boy caught it, and looked at it questioningly. "I have never before seen a man so... what is the word... intimidated... before. He is a brave martial artist!"<p>It took a moment for Ranma to realize the man was being sarcastic, before chuckling himself, "Yeah, but Mom can be pretty... disturbing in her own right. Can't say I completely blame him, though the old man is a pretty big coward when it comes to things."<p>"Please, sit down," Thomas requested, patting the empty space next to him. After several moments pause, Ranma complied, before finally deciding to open the can he was given. It wasn't as if he hadn't drank beer before, but the last time he had was with Nabiki.<p>"Akane had no right to get involved," Thomas stated, somberly, "I apologise."<p>"Yeah, well she kinda had a point," Ranma admitted, sounding more to reaffirm things to himself than explain to the man next to him.<p>"No, it was not in her place she should not be involved," Thomas replied, staring to the carp pond, "I did warn her not to get involved. She did not want to listen to me." The native American took a long drink during the pregnant silence. "When Soun told me everything, I... was not happy with Akane. Last night, the word 'divorce' was said, more than once... by me."<p>Ranma looked away, staring at his barely touched can that he had cupped between his hands, "Oh man, I'm sorry."<p>"It is not your fault," Thomas stated, quickly, "I love Akane, I do not want it to come to this... er... that. Akane must learn, even if she is of good intentions. She can not take things to her own hands when she dislikes the outcome. She can not throw a temper tantrum every time something does not go her way. I love her for her dedication, and her {compassion}..." Thomas had to switch to English for the single word, not knowing the translation. Even still, Ranma understood. "...but I do not condone what she has done."<p>"She... sounds like a nice woman, I guess."<p>Thomas nodded, "I would not have married her if she was not." Before he could continue, they both felt a presence behind them. Almost in unison, they turned, to find Akane standing beyond the threshold outside.<p>Ranma noticed that the woman looked definitely on the side of miserable; the faint tearstreaks were just barely noticable, further assisting to accent her expression along with the cowed and sullen frown she was wearing. Her eyes flickered to Ranma briefly, before she quickly focused on her husband.<p>Thomas's expression, Ranma saw, was neutral, though it was obvious that he was not comfortable. "Akane," he acknowledged her presence with very little emotion.<p>Silently, the youngest Tendou daughter slightly gestured with her head towards the pigtailed martial artist, her face wearing a pleading expression.<p>Even if he was still angry with her, Thomas Morningbreeze understood his wife's request, and the reasons behind them. Still, he didn't find it his decision to call. "{That's up to Ranma,}" he told his wife in English.<p>Akane nodded, and looked at Ranma, "Um... Ranma, could I speak to you, please?"<p>The pigtailed young man felt more than a little nervous in her presence, even in the state he could see her in. He studied her for several moments, before nodding. He may as well hear what she had to say; she obviously had her reasons for the past, after all. Perhaps she could also help him to understand a few things.<p>With permission granted, Thomas's face frowned almost imperceptively, before he stood up. "I'm going to go check up on the boys." With that, he left for upstairs, where they were playing.<p>Akane took her husband's place, albeit almost a foot further from the younger martial artist. Ranma continued to stare at the can of beer in his hands, not sure what to say. The permeating quiet was becoming agitating for the both of them, yet neither had the courage to start things.<p>"Back when we were younger, Nabiki never dated much. She always said she had better things to do." Akane suddenly started, grabbing Ranma's attention. He noticed she was looking about the yard, anywhere but at him.<p>Brushing her hair from the left side of her face, she continued, "I know Kasumi used to get dates pretty easily, and I literally had to beat guys off me... not that I'm trying to sound arrogant..." Akane's face darkened for a second, "Thanks to Kuno. Hard to believe he became the Headmaster of Furinkan, though I heard he's been gone for a while."<p>"Oh," Ranma replied, not sure what this had to do with anything.<p>"I figured guys didn't bother her because she was giving them the cold shoulder, or milking them for all they were worth," Akane continued. "She did just fine, getting exellent grades in school, scoring one of the top twenty slots in the college placement tests for our district. While Kasumi was dating Dr. Tofu, and I was busy trying to get small acting jobs, Nabiki was going to college. Suddenly, I hear she was headhunted for some investment job that had started up just recently then, I was getting pretty envious of her."<p>The woman sniffed, and hunched over with her arms on top of her legs, "She did great in school, she then got an exellent job that would end up paying her more than I thought I would ever see, and she was independant. Kasumi married Dr. Tofu, and I decided that I just didn't have a chance in Japan for an acting career, and went for broke. Dad wasn't happy about the heir to his martial arts school leaving for the US... he was even more upset when I met Thomas... and became engaged to him."<p>Akane gave a mirthless chuckle at the recollection, realizing the faint parallel between her past situation, and the one Nabiki was in now. Difference being replace her father with herself, exchange herself for Nabiki, and Thomas for Ranma.<p>"What's so funny?" Ranma enquired, missing the bitterness and realization in her slight outburst.<p>Akane waved the question off, "Nothing... it's nothing. You know? Nabiki, I have to admit, became a large role model to me. Great job, her freedom, and an indulgent lifestyle. Because of her, I probably worked much harder than I wouuld have, but I... I managed to gain a life I was... I am very happy with."<p>Akane started to sniffle, causing Ranma to realize she was trying not to cry. "Ah, are you alright?"<p>"I'm fine, I am," Akane responded, slightly surprised and more endeared to the pigtailed young man for his concern. "But Nabiki, she had it all, it seemed. Exept one thing. I had Thomas, and Kasumi had Tofu... as far as I knew at the time, she wasn't seeing anyone. Then one day, Daddy called me to give me the big news... Nabiki was getting engaged."<p>"I... I wasn't sure how to take that news, but I was happy for her, a bit jealous, but still happy for her. After a few months... Kasumi called me... about Nabiki. She told me the engagement was off, and that it may be best if I could come back as soon as possible. At the time, I had started teaching at Thomas's gym, so I could easily get the time off to find out what happened."<p>Akane closed her eyes, bowing her head. She had to take a deep breath, before continuing on, "I... I never thought I would ever see Nabiki like that. She had always seemed strong, so confident, like nothing could phase her. Yet... when I tried to visit her one day at home, and found those knives all over the floor... I... I..."<p>The middle aged woman's voice began to shudder, but she managed to open her teary eyes, and look towards the sky, "Thank God, she couldn't do it, she still had will within her. I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. Me, Kasumi, and a couple of Nabiki's friends pretty much formed a twenty-four hour survelance team around her, and I hunted down the bastard that did that to her... I didn't think I would ever stop making him pay for what he had done to my sister. I... I actually wanted to kill him, but I stopped." Akane snorted, "Sometimes, I used to wonder if I should have, if it would have been worth it to put him out of Nabiki's misery. But Nabiki managed to pull through, she was still pretty strong, though after that, she... didn't show any interest in men."<p>"I think about then, I also realized.. yeah, a lot of women are cheated on, and I thought Nabiki would have been tougher than that. In fact, I expected her to make Saito and Michiko's life a living hell for screwing behind her back... but she just left them alone." Akane looked directly at Ranma again, her face pained from rememberance and re-realization, "Nabiki wasn't secure with guys, that's why she never dated, and when she did, kept them at a distance. If I didn't know better, and I'm not so sure I actually do, I would almost believe that she had some irrational fear of relationships. I had vowed that any guy who attempted to hurt my sister again... well... I don't know if I was going to stop."<p>"It was a moot point, anyways. I thought Nabiki was making a full recovery, time and wounds, and all that. Eventually, she was even somewhat self-depreciating in her humor about her relationship life. Her friend Jessica... or Jesse as she prefers... says the Japanese tend to butcher her name too often... wasn't much a help with her attitude, since she seemed to share Sis's weird humor. I began to think it was alright, it was good to have my sister back the way I was used to her; strong and independant."<p>Akane closed her eyes, and sighed before glaring at Ranma, "Then you came along. When Kasumi called me, telling me you managed to make Nabiki fall for you, least to say I was a bit... agitated."<p>Akane chuckled, while Ranma looked at her curiously.<p>" Here, I saw Nabiki recovered from a bad relationship, only to come into one that was even worse. All I saw this time was a bad situation that couldn't get any worse. You can thank my husband, he's a smart enough man to keep me under control... sometimes." The woman's face twitched slightly, regretting he had failed this last time, or maybe it should be she failed him, "Didn't work when I found out about what you did to Nabiki-I mean what I thought-"<p>"I understand," Ranma interjected, "that was my fault, and nothing I will ever be able to do will make it up, but I can damn sure try."<p>"Rather bold swearing around your elders," Akane joked. Ranma colored slightly, before looking down at the beer. Akane grinned wryly, "At least you're sorry about it, and even if I don't know the details, I have a feeling that it won't happen again... *right*?" Ranma meekly nodded in affirmative.<p>"I'm... I'm sorry myself. I've never been sorrier for something in my life."<p>"But you had a-"<p>"Don't interrupted young man," Akane cut in, "It's not just because I... me and Thomas may have developed some problems between us, or that I'm no longer three years away from gaining my sixth degree... I'm sorry, for what I did to Nabiki, for losing her trust in me. I'm also sorry for.. for what I did to you. I shouldn't have done that, I know better than that, not that it matters now."<p>"Oh man, you were stripped of your rank?" Ranma enquired, a bit shocked at that news.<p>Akane blinked, before looking at Ranma, and chuckling, "That would be the least of my worries, I think, but no, I didn't drop rank, at least not yet. Happosai was seriously considering it, but thankfully Dad made the call before he did. It doesn't mean that I still won't be busted down in the future."<p>"I'm sorry to hear that."<p>"It was my fault, quit apologising, alright?" Akane nearly snapped, before she caught Ranma shifting slightly in defense. Akane shook her head, "Really, it was my own pigheadedness that got me into this, I have to face the consequences."<p>"Maybe if I put in a word in your favor..."<p>This time, Akane stared at Ranma, with a little more than slight admiration and respect, "You really do forgive me, don't you?"<p>It was Ranma's turn to look away, "You figured out something that everyone else didn't, or at least were ignoring. I had to think on what you said, because I didn't want to hurt Nabiki... ever... in anyway. Unfortunately, I have to make a decision as to which way I will have to hurt her, which way would be best for her in the long run."<p>Akane scooted over to Ranma, patting him on the back, "I guess I owe you more than an apology. Its an honor to know that someone like you... is taking care of Nabiki."<p>"That's all I want to do for her," Ranma replied, "Even if I had to give up my own future for her, so be it."<p>"I believe you," Akane said with a warm smile, "But... there's just one thing."<p>"Yeah?" Ranma asked.<p>"If you *ever* bring any harm to my sister, I swear, by all that I hold sacred, I will finish off where I left off the night before," Akane said in the utmost serious, "and nothing, and I mean nothing, will help you."<p>Ranma glared cooly at the older woman, "If that ever happened, I swear on my honor as a martial artist, on anything I've ever held dear..."<p>"...I will let you. And you owe me a rematch."<p>At Ranma's rebuke, Akane blinked, and blinked again, before she started giggling. After a while, Ranma began chuckling himself. Neither noticed the eldest sister standing behind them, her arms still full of groceries. Quietly, she went back to the kitchen, where she could do most of her thinking. She had a lot to think about.<p>_<p>Ranma walked throughout the evening, contemplating the conversation he had with Akane two days ago. He had been adimant about ignoring Nabiki's past, telling himself it didn't matter; that... may have proved a large part of his folly. As much as he had been appehensive to facing Nabiki's younger sister again, it had been more than a little enlightening.<p>He didn't consider the impact it would have on others, their relationship. It was more than *painfully* apparent that Akane and Kasumi were overprotective of their sister, and even if Akane admitted that she would no longer be able to watch over Nabiki, and gave the task over to Ranma, it still didn't mean that he wasn't still under the microscope.<p>That wasn't the only thing he had been considering for the last few days. As Happosai fiercely expressed, Ranma was the center of the problem, but as Ranma himself had begun to realize, particularly after talking with Akane, not *the* problem. He had the belief that he was the one Nabiki would always need for help, the one she would always rely on, and that was a weight he could not hope to bear. He had not the experience nor the knowledge to help her carry through an already in place carreer, and he wasn't mature enough, even admitting to himself, to comprehend the scope of the issues they would assuradly come across.<p>Maybe it was arrogant of him, but that's how it had always seemed. In movies and such, that's how it was always made out to be. The obviously flawed lessons from his father about manhood expressed such, and even knowing his father was usually wrong (as Nabiki helped to point out) on such things, it was hard to argue when society in general seemed to support the idea.<p>No, it wasn't him that was directly the problem, but the dynamics of the relationship he shared with Nabiki. Quite frankly, Ranma and everyone else would simply have to accept the obvious role reversal that would most likely happen. Nabiki had a fully developed career she most likely had no intention of quitting anytime soon, while Ranma hadn't even entirely decided what he wanted to do with his life. Humorously, he thought about the fact that he was already doing the cooking, and on occasion keeping up behind Nabiki. Wonder what his mother would think of her 'manly' son during those instances...<p>Still, even if he realized he was actually... comfortable with the idea, very few others were. He didn't think he was ignorant to the society he lived in, even if at times he was at a loss on how to interact with it. Nabiki had a lot to lose, a lot more to lose than he did; it just wouldn't be a fair tradeoff in any case. Selfishly, he bulldozed through the very same arguments that was now pondering when Nabiki herself had been using them, until he eradicated any resistance she had. That left her far too vunerable to the rest of the world, especially after the night they had shared one another's presence in the most intimate way. She didn't care, she was adimant about not caring; she refused to care as long as she had Ranma. The level of desperation she displayed when he ran from her those agonizingly long days ago was the final coal that would ignite into the pyre that rent their lives asunder.<p>Akane may have given her blessings, but he didn't think she had put the amout of thought he had into things. Plus, Akane was humbled and apologetic, Ranma thought that her previous view was more insightful. Ranma said he wasn't ready to 'be an adult' like Nabiki.<p>The amount of growing up he had to do recently left him feeling older than he should.<p>During his reverie, he didn't even notice the ebony cloth of night draped soundly over sky above, while the streetlights began to illminate the way for the denzens around him with places to go, and the lost, such as himself. He had nowhere to go; surely his mother had already been contacted about the whole thing, so she was out of the question. He couldn't use the account Nabiki set up for him, being rather familiar with her methods of tracking people down, and it wasn't as if he wasn't used to living without money. Although, Nabiki did spoil him a bit.<p>Downtrodden by his own misery, and dumbfounded by his predicerment, Ranma sighed, and sat on the curb, contemplating his options.<p>"You there..."<p>"Huh?" Ranma quickly looked up and to the direction of who had spoken. Standing above him, dressed curiously in a gi and hakama, a guy Ranma hadn't ever seen before. Ranma gestured to himself, a bit confused as to why he was being addressed.<p>"Indeed, it is you I address," the other young man confirmed, "I could not help but notice your crestfallen spirit. Though you are obviously of humble origins, it is apparent that you retain a noble heart that is in dire need of my exellent counsoling."<p>"Ah... I... guess..." Ranma replied, attempting to dissect what was being said to him.<p>"come now, never let it be said that Tatewake Kuno, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, would ever prove apathetic to the common man. Speak now, lest your soul remain in great turmoil." The other young man started to kneel on the sidewalk, before scrunching his face in distain. Taking out a hankerchief, he carefully placed it next to Ranma, and knelt in a seiza position along side him.<p>Ranma's mind was too distracted to note the precautions being taken by the other man, "Ah, Ranma Saotome... It's noth... well..." Ranma thought about it, perhaps he needed the thoughts of someone removed from the situation. "Well, this... woman. We were, you know, kinda in a relationship, and we had to work hard at it just to get it started, you know?"<p>Ranma sighed, looking towards the streetlights across the sky, "We just got blind to everything else. And now, if we stay together, she's going to end up getting hurt. I can't risk that for nothing."<p>"Ah, yes, for the course of true love floweth like the mightiest rivers; either we accept its benevolent currents, even when tainted with the silt and flotsam that doth provide perilous obstacle, or we battle futilly against its roaring and malicious tides, raging against our hearts as potent as the fury of the storm that provoked its wrath."<p>Ranma shirked back from the complex, archaic speech; finding it almost went completely over his head. Not wanting to appear less intelligent than Kuno seemed to favor him as, Ranma nodded, "Yeah, I guess. It's just that, I do... love her." Ranma snorted, "No, I DO love her, more than I think I've even loved the art. But now... I'm scared I have to give her up."<p>"NAY! DO NOT SPEAK SUCH DEFEATEST BLASPHEMY!" Kuno suddenly shouted, grabbing Ranma by the shoulders, and startling him, "Did Theseus not risk all in his quest for Helen? Was it not true that Hojo Masako take the celebate vows of a nun amidst the honoring grief of her husband? Did Abelard not forfeit his manhood for the sake of Heloise?"<p>"Ah... that last example wasn't needed," Ranma replied, uneasily, while looking around for any possible spillable liquids.<p>"My brother in dicipline! If there is but ONE goal we live our lives for, ONE reason we continue each sweet breath, it shall be for LOVE! For there is NO greater reward for existance!" At the apex of his speech, Kuno held up a bokken, as his posture was accentuated by the sudden burst of lighting and rolling thunder.<p>"Uh... wow..." Ranma replied, rather moved.<p>"Bother dear, if you are quite finished making a spectacle of yourself..." A young woman with ink dark hair wearing an extravagant gown -much more oppulant than necessary for strolling through the evening streets- approached, before pausing at the sight of her brother's companion, "...Perhaps you would like to introduce me to your... friend?"<p>"Ah, my unbalanced sibling, if I may have the honor of presenting a fellow compatriot in the arts of battle, Saotome."<p>"Uh, hi," Ranma replied, awkwardly and distractedly.<p>"Kodachi Kuno, Charmed," the young woman replied, savoring the feast of masculinity before her eyes.<p>"My comrade had sought the legendary wisdom of Takewake Kuno, desperately enquiring in the affairs of romance and the ways of women."<p>"'Desperation' wouldn't begin to cover the rediculous notion of you assisting in such matters," Kodachi retorted, before musing to herself, "Pity to whatever harlot would shun such a ravishing specimen, if a tad bred on the... humble side. I may pesume..." Kodachi paused with a delicious grin, "...that you are unattached? My brother and I were to attend a quaint soiree that unfortunately promises to evening of droll and humbug. Mayhaps a nice gentleman such as yourself could help liven a poor maiden's evening?" Kodachi then twisted the corner of her lip slightly, "That is, after we make a brief sidetrek to garner you the appropriate attire."<p>"Ah... no thanks, I... um, have things I need to do," Ranma responded, lamely, before turning to Tatewake, "And thanks for the pep talk, I guess it did do a little for me."<p>The Kuno snorted in an attempt to be modest, "Tis nothing, though I am flattered you are awed by my natural charisma."<p>"You mistake that for our ego, brother-dear. And it's a shame, yet I forsee that our fates may be once again entwined, Saotome. Until that day, I bid farewell. Come, brother, I wish to partake in some genuine entertainment before make our token presence."<p>"Yes, let us hasten our own departure, for our presence shall completely command festivities!" Tatewake proclaimed, he began to lead his sister off, but paused. "Saotome, even if you mind thinks itself rightous, the heart feels for the truth. Is that not a lesson all soldiers learn in the art?" With that, he continued on.<p>Ranma watched the two depart, feeling the slightest of smiles touch his face. "Yeah, I guess you gotta just go with your gut sometimes..."<p>_<p>Ranma observed wistfully from the top of the house, as the off-white BMW pulled out of the driveway, and drove off. His eyes followed it, until it rounded a corner, putting it out of his sight. He couldn't help but wish that he had personally saw her off, tasted her lips and smile, and wished her well during the day. Even without the routine that he so dearly missed, he would be thinking of her all day.<p>Not even a week, and he missed her so much. Once again, he risked being caught, just to catch a glimpse of her. True, it was far from enough to satisfy him, but it gave him some small consolence to know she was at least functioning. In time, she could forget him, and move on but he knew that he never wanted that to happen.<p>"Hey Shampoo," Ranma barely greeted above a whisper, not turning from where he had seen Nabiki's car vanish at.<p>"Ranma," the Lavender haired girl in her school outfit greeted, "What is it that brings you here?"<p>"I miss her," Ranma responded simply, and truthfully.<p>"Then why is it you remain at distance? It is she who misses you too," Shampoo stated, barely covering her anger and controlling her volume.<p>"Because... I know I wouldn't be able to leave if I came back to her," Ranma replied, pulling his knees to his chest.<p>Shampoo took a step towards him, her expression softening, "Is that so bad? Even in my company, she is now more alone than I have known one to be. She is hurt, Ranma, you are the only salve that can heal her."<p>"Shampoo, there' ain't nothing I would like to do more than forget everything that's eating me up inside, forget what happened or what could happen, and just stay with her, alright?" Ranma almost growled, "But the damn problem is, the more I realize how much she means to me, the more I realize I can't do this to her. Worse, the more I realize I can't do this to her, the more I know... the more I know I can't just give her up..."<p>"Interesting paradox, I believe that is the correct word," Shampoo said, "You believe you must let her be, yet you cannot do so."<p>"Yeah, that sound pretty much the case," Ranma replied with a mirthless chuckle, "Tell me, how is she doing?"<p>"She fairs better than four days ago, yet she hurts just as so."<p>"So you're now some sort of expert on paradoxes?"<p>"No, it is that I have too, too good a case study," Shampoo smirked, before coming to stand by Ranma's side, "You are a being opposition, of conflicts. In turn, you are one who can create harmony. Such is your nature. You are her virility youth, while she has created withing you wisdom in experience. You know the purest truth between you, yet you hide behind false pretenses. You are vehemance in her need, yet you quietly bow humbly for her welfare." Shampoo tossed her hair, "You are love, and destruction."<p>"Well, that's the second time recently I've heard all this put into poetry," Ranma snorted, "Unfortunately, peotry isn't giving me the answer to this problem." Ranma finally turned to look towards Shampoo, "I don't want to lose her, and I know she doesn't want me to leave. We both know that I can't stay, at least until things cool down."<p>"So you do not intend to remain gone?" Shampoo felt a great deal of relief at that, yet she sensed something else, "But... you do not know how long you shall be gone."<p>Ranma caught the insinuation that it was not a question, but a stated fact, "I... don't."<p>"I should by rights, ensure my sister's wayward husband is returned..."<p>"And then nothing would be accomplished, would there?"<p>Shampoo walked towards the edge of the house, deciding to let the implied assault on her ability slide, "If you wish to leave, then do so. If not, she will be home tonight. Do not dally on your decision for longer, lest I find a way to make it for you." Shampoo jumped from the roof, and headed for school.<p>_<p>Everyone he talked to, their answers were more or less the same. As much as he wanted to simply accept it as truth, there was just more to it than even the sum of their arguments.<p>Ranma knew what he was missing, and knew where to get it. What he needed, was an alternative opinion...<p>Like the one he would be able to find sweeping the front steps of the Tendou home.<p>Seeking prudence, Ranma walked to the front gate, and knocked. He didn't wait long, before it was opened, and he saw the last thing he ever expected to see, Kasumi smile.<p>Of course, it didn't last when she realized who was at the gate. It was as if the sun was being imitated by a halogen lamp, suddenly shut off or burnt out, as her cheerful countenance dropped like light before darkness. "Ranma."<p>"Yeah," the pigtailed martial artist replied, quietly.<p>Kasumi stared at him for the longest time, "You're here to talk to me, aren't you?"<p>At the question, Ranma flinched in surprise, "How?"<p>With a derisive snort, Kasumi motioned Ranma to follow, "Akane is in the tea room, while David and father are out with Genma and Tofu. We can talk in the front yard if you wish the privacy."<p>"I guess that'll be fine," Ranma replied, attempting vainly to shake off the nervous feeling that was reverberating through him. He really didn't even know how to broach the subject, but knew without a doubt where she expected the conversation to lay.<p>Kasumi stopped next to one of the cultivated oak trees of the yard, and reached into her apron for a pack of cigerettes and a lighter. Lighting a cigerette with practiced ease, Kasumi simply waited for Ranma to start.<p>Gathering his courage, Ranma began, "You... well I know you don't approve of me and Nabiki's relationship. I want to tell you first that there is absolutely nothing that I want more for her than for her to be happy."<p>Kasumi was turned away, so Ranma couldn't see her face, "I'm sure you do."<p>Ranma's face contorted slightly past irritance, "Look, I may not be the best guy for her, hell, I ain't even a guy ALL the time! But I do bet this; there ain't a woman alive that I wouldn't give everything I got for. Even if it means she ends up hat'n me for the rest of her life, and I end up with no life or future ahead of me, I would GLADLY let her go!" Ranma quieted, startled at his own vehemance, "But... I don't want to just, just give her up like that. You'ld be right to say I'm not... experienced enough to understand this fight, but that doesn't mean I won't keep going into it."<p>"You'e here for a reason, Ranma, it would be best for both of us if you got straight to it."<p>Ranma closed his eyes, and turned away, "Everyone says I should just go running back to her, and just face the consequences of what will happen between us. She has a lot more to lose than I do, and it's not fair for her to put so much at stake... for me."<p>The eldest of the Tendou sisters stopped before taking a puff from her cigerette. With a deep, appraising glare, she looked the young man over, "But you're still thinking about going back to her, regardless of the consequences that it will have on her."<p>"I wanted to hear what you had to say about that," Ranma admitted, "there ain't anyone who's standing in the middle ground, so I need your opinion as a contrast. I know you don't even like me that much, but right now, what you have to say is pretty important to me."<p>"Even if you don't like what I have to say?" Ranma only fidgeted slightly, and kept his tongue still. Kasumi rolled her eyes, moving closer to the tree. The waning moon's illuminance was hidden from her by the carapice of the tree, plunging her frame into shadow, "I don't see why Nabiki now thinks she needs someone to spend her life with, she was doing fine. I know you heard from Akane how we both admired her, but I'm also pretty jealous of what she has."<p>Kasumi took a quick puff, before continuing, almost angrily, "I got married, because I thought it was the only think I was meant for. You know? I was content, I loved Tofu, I love my boys... but I hated that life. Nabiki wasn't tied down to anything, she has less responsibilities, less worries, a lot more freedom than I could have hoped for. She opted not to become a housewife, and she did great. Me? I have some minor college and nurse's training, but I have too many obligations to pursue anything like that. I'm too old to try. All I have are my children, my father, and my sisters."<p>"Now, Nabiki wants to suddenly settle down with a kid as a spouce? You tell me where the intelligence in that is! Not only that, she's totally blind to the few responsibilities she does have because of you. She's a role model as well as a popular face in her neighborhood. I heard what Akane told you when you two were fighting. 'Ruin' doesn't even begin to describe what you can, and will do to her. She doesn't deserve the grief you're going to give her. She doesn't need the jealousies when she sees your eyes wander for that tiny moment, or that niggling fear that never goes away, after the first time she sees you mad. She doesn't need the grief of having to take care of you. She doesn't need you in her life!"<p>"Oh..." Ranma replied, truly seeing Kasumi's point of view, but not from the way she wanted to expess it. For several moments, they were silent, before Ranma spoke again, "I'm sorry."<p>"If you were, you wouldn't-"<p>"No... I didn't mean that," Rana interjected, "You loved Tofu, a lot, right? Well, I don't know what he did to hurt you, but I don't think he meant to."<p>"That has nothing to do with you!"<p>"Maybe not, but it might have a lot to do with why you hate me."<p>Kasumi quelled at that. "I don't hate you, Ranma," she said, remembering saying the same words long ago, but to her ex-husband, not Ranma.<p>"Kasumi..." Ranma paused, as if ready to anticipate a blow, "...sis... like I said, I would do nothing to hurt Nabiki, EVER... with everything I got, I'll even protect her from whatever might harm her... and you and Akane."<p>Kasumi's eyes went wide, and she nearly dropped her cigerette, as Ranma hugged her, "I'm serious, If I'm with Nabiki, I'm giving my word that I'm gonna be there for all of ya. I ain't mad at you, I know you were only doing it for Nabiki. I appreciate that, and I think Nabiki will, in time."<p>"Wh-what are you doing?" Kasumi choked out, shocked by the sudden embrace.<p>"...I'm not sure," Ranma replied, slowly letting go, " it just kinda felt like the best thing to do."<p>"Well it wasn't" the woman retorted, hastefully attempting to take a drag from her cigerette, and actually failing.<p>"Then I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you again." Ranma bowed, before walking back from Kasumi. "Thanks for your advice, it really did help a lot."<p>Kasumi turned away, and grunted in reply. She heard Ranma's footsteps begin to slowly retreat again, and spoke to him one last time before he left, "If it doesn't... work out between you and Nabiki, what then?"<p>Ranma turned around to look at Kasumi. She was once again out of the shadow of the tree, allowing the moonlight to shine it's dull glow upon her attempt at a netrual expression that failed to hide the glimmer of something in her eyes. Ranma smiled wistfully, "Then I'll still be there, for all three of you. You have my word as a martial artist." With that, Ranma leapt to the surrounding wall, and then to a nearby rooftop.<p>Kasumi stood watching the pigtailed martial artist vanish into the night, once again forced to think on things. She turned back to the house that had been her home for so many years, and brought her not even half expended cigerette to her mouth. Just as her lips touched it, she paused.<p>Snuffing the flame against the tree trunk, she then went into the Tendou family home. She removed the pack of cigerettes from her apron, and idly threw them into the trash. She turned on the kitchen faucet, and ran the cigerette butt she still had under the sink, ensuring it was fully drenched. At that moment, Tofu stepped into view.<p>"Kasumi?"<p>"Tofu... if it would be okay, could we talk?"<p>The doctor didn't dare hope what she was asking, but the faint sound of hope and longing in her voice was audible. "Yes, we'll talk later," Tofu responded, unable to stop the faint smile growing his lips. Even after all this time, he still couldn't help but love her.<p>"Later?" Kasumi asked, looking at him. Her face was unreadable, but she had an edge in her voice.<p>Tofu nodded, not giving into the instinct to become defensive, "First... I think I have to go thank someone."<p>Quickly understanding, Kasumi gave a barely noticable nod, "He was heading back south, but I presume you saw that?"<p>Tofu fully smiled, "Yes, I did."<p>_<p>Ranma hadn't been running very fast, since he wasn't in a hurry to o anywhere. Finally, it was time to make his decision. With consideration to everything everyone has said to him; Happosai's angered attack on his arrogance, Akane's humble blessing, Kuno's vehement commandment of duty, and Kasumi's subtle expression of her own fears; Ranma understood... he just couldn't leave Nabiki alone.<p>At that, he came to a stop, and turned to face southeast. She would be home by now, since in a couple of hours she would be turning in for the night. He pictured her asleep, now covering only half of her bed, as if expecting him to be there for her right then, and still there in the morning. He knew he belonged there, with her, and knew that leaving her would be a mistake. He swore to himself, wondering even why he thought it an option. He was Ranma Saotome, he wasn't going to let anything beat him, especially his own insecurities.<p>With a deep sigh, he took one step, the first step back to her, when he caught sight of someone, barely visible in the clouded moonlight, racing across the rooftops towards him. Finding no reason to avoid whomever, the pigtailed martial artist patiently waited.<p>Ranma blinked, when he finally was able to recognise the person, "Uh, Doctor Tofu?"<p>Relieved that Ranma had stopped for him, the doctor smiled, disguising his slight windedness, "Hello Ranma, we never got to talk much, I'm afraid."<p>Ranma smirked, "Na, we didn't, 'sup?"<p>Tofu turned to look at the moon, "Ranma, before you leave, I was hoping we could talk."<p>Ranma's smirk melted into wistfulness, "Don't worry, doc, I'm not going anywhere."<p>At that, Tofu started, "You did decide to stay, then?" At Ranma's nod, Tofu's expression grew firm, "that was actually the reason I think we do need to talk."<p>Ranma blinked, not quite expecting that.<p>_<p>"I hope you enjoy the tea, it's all I really have at the moment," Tofu apologised, sitting at the receptionist desk, while Ranma sat on the waiting couch.<p>"That's alright, thanks anyhow." Ranma looked into the tea, still unsure of what the doctor wanted to talk to him about, "So, what's the problem?"<p>Tofu twitched, wishing the pigtailed young man wasn't so blunt and seeking the point. Pushing his glasses up his nose, Tofu began, "Ranma, I was originally going to talk to you about making sure you return... but now I think it's best if I ask you to go ahead and leave."<p>"WHAT?"<p>"Calm down, Ranma," Tofu quickly placated, "Just listen to what I have to say..."<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes, "You better make it quick, and you better sure as hell not expect me to follow your 'advice' when you're done."<p>Tofu held his cup of tea with both hands, and mused on how he would explain himself, "Tonight, Soun told me something. Nabiki seems to be doing rather fine right now."<p>Ranma frowned, as he felt like he had been punched in the gut with a battering ram, "Wh-what?"<p>"When you left, she was devestated that night. You hurt her pretty bad, and I don't even think she truly understood what was going on. I wouldn't blame her, it all did happen pretty fast."<p>"Well, it wasn't exactly two plus two for me, either," Ranma quipped, "I've been thinking about this whole damn thing the whole time. In the end, I just realized I was damned if I did, damned if I didn't..." Ranma looked Tofu directly in the eyes, defiantly, "So, why shouldn't I be selfish about this? What's wrong with at least trying to make it work. It ain't like I'll just cave in under pressure."<p>"Ranma," Tofu began again, "I'm not even going to claim I understand her, or that I'm an expert in psychology, but I think the two of you do need time apart, for her to recover."<p>"Recover from what?"<p>"When you've fractured a bone, pulled a muscle, or strained a tendon, do you immidiately begin working it?"<p>Ranma paused at the change of subject, "Uh... no... you got to let it heal properly first, but what-"<p>"When you ran away, you broke Nabiki's heart. Believe me when I say that's no small issue." Tofu interjected, almost coldly.<p>Ranma slightly cowed at that, "I... I wasn't intending to hurt her."<p>Tofu set his cup of tea on the desk, and stood up. He walked to the bookshelf, looking through the titles displayed on the spines as he continued the conversation, "I know, it was a pretty hectic night, but things still happened that make everything else more than a little difficult."<p>"You said Nabiki was recovering," Ranma said, feeling a cold fear beginning to grip him, "Is she...?"<p>"Getting over you?" Tofu asked, "I wouldn't know, but I doubt it. You left quite an impact with her. What I'm talking about is you were right what you said. Nabiki was willing to toss her family to the side, forfiet her career, and leave everything behind just to convince you. I doubt you would lead her into that trap she fell in several years ago, but with you she had other dangers."<p>Ranma looked down, ashamed, "I know, damn it, I knew what was happening, but I didn't care until then!"<p>Tofu shook his head, "No, it's obvious you cared, that's why this whole thing has been tearing you to pieces. Nabiki was too dependant on you, and she could have been blindsided by any manner of things. As much as I hate to make the comparison, you were pretty much a drug addiction to her."<p>"Gee, thanks," Ranma replied, wryly but without humor.<p>Tofu smirked, "Sorry. Anyhow, you're a good thing for her, Ranma, but she needed to get her head back on straight." Tofu sighed, "And if you go back to her now, it will end up undoing what she's been struggling with for the last few days. Maybe even worse so."<p>"I think I know what you mean, doc." Ranma replied glumly, cursing his own foolishness.<p>"It would probably be worse, because she would get the idea that you just won't ever leave her."<p>"But I wouldn't! I swear I won't!"<p>"Ranma, you're a martial artist, because of that, anything could happen to you. What if you were in an accident? How would that affect her?"<p>"Not good, I guess."<p>Tofu nodded, "I don't think she would be capable of anything in that instance." Tofu approached Ranma, and sat next to him on the couch, "Give her some time, let her heal, and when you return, maybe she'll be ready to start working that heart of hers for you again."<p>"So, what do I do until then?"<p>Tofu shrugged, "You don't have to be gone long. Maybe a little training trip."<p>"Yeah, I guess that would work," Ranma responded, leaning out of his seat. "I should let her know I'm not leaving her for good, though. Guess it would be good to leave her with something, let her know I will be returning..."<p>Tofu looked at Ranma, contemplating something. He knew one of Nabiki's fondest wishes, even if she was hesitant to state it. "Ranma... how serious are you about committing to Nabiki?"<p>"You actually had to ask me that?" Ranma counter-questioned, barely containing his indignation.<p>"I mean, committed enough to want to start a family with her?"<p>Ranma started at that, "W-well... I... uh..."<p>"Ranma..."<p>Taking a deep breath, Ranma thought about how much he loved Nabiki, "Yeah, I would like that. Heh, it would certainly make Mom happy..."<p>Tofu smirked, "Well, there's something you can give her. I don't know if you understand a thing or two about women when they're older, but... their time is rather limited when it comes to having children, though measures can be taken to make the conception run a lot smoother. Nabiki's a healthy woman, but even her safety can be an issue."<p>Ranma was already blushing, but had to ask, "Ah... what are you talking about?"<p>Taking a deep breath, Tofu gathered himself. Ranma would be plenty embarrassed from this conversation...<p>_<p>Ranma shifted his new training sack on his shoulder, deciding to risk use of his account, seeing as how he wouldn't be in the area for much longer. Earlier during the day had been rather embarrassing, as Tofu explained. Ranma thought with a chagrin how much he would rather have done things the natural way, but decided he and Nabiki could make up the missed step when he returned.<p>He finally set his travelling luggage on the ground, just as Tofu sat down at the receptionist desk, picked up a pen, and looked at Ranma expectantly.<p>With a deep breath, Ranma began, "Hi, Nabiki, I hope you're doing okay. I didn't mean to run out on you like that, no, I guess I did, but not like you're thinking, if you're thinking I did it to hurt you or something. I just wanted to say, that what I did was the hardest thing<p>I ever had to do, but I really had to do it. Don't get me wrong,it wasn't your fault, I justcouldn't stand hurting you any more than I figured out I was."<p>"Your sister was right about some things, but she didn't need to tell me anything. I hate telling you this, I really do, but I think we need some time apart, to think about things. Both of us got too deep in things without thinking about them first. I hope this doesn't sound like I'm breaking up with you, because that isn't it at all. I love you, I really do, Nabiki, and just thinking that I MIGHT do something to hurt you makes me crazy."<p>Tofu gave Ranma some time, being polite to ignore the slight crack that Ranma developed in his voice<p>With a shuddering breath, Ranma continued, "I'm not leaving you, you got that? I'm coming back, no matter what your sisters say, or anyone thinks. I've been talking with a few people, and... and I had a lot to sort out. I think the biggest thing I was worried about, was leaving you alone. The doc gave me an idea, and... I'm not against it. I hope you don't freak out or nothing, and he said you would understand it, so I guess what happens next... is up to you."<p>Ranma turned to Tofu, "Are you sure she'll understand?" Tofu nodded, and motioned Ranma to continue.<p>"I promise I won't be gone long, and I'll be keeping in touch with you. Please don't tell my Pops, because the vacation I had from him still wasn't long enough. So, I guess I'll see you around. No I won't, well, whatever. I love you, Nabiki." Ranma opened his eyes, and smiled at Tofu, "I guess that's the best way to finish this up."<p>Smiling back, Tofu began to stand, intending to put the letter aside with the one meant for his parents. As he did so, Ranma blinked in though, "Oh, wait a sec..." Ranma dropped down to kneeling by his bag, and quickly sorted through it, retrieving a series of photos, "Ah, doc... would you happen to have an envelope or something to put these in...?"<p>_<p>_<p>Epilogue, pt 2<p>_<p>_<p>Nabiki smiled from the top of the stairs, finished with putting Jessica to bed. Her mohogany eyes kept direct contact with Ranma's slate gray, as she descended the spiral staircase.<p>As she approached the ponytailed martial artist, she picked up a remote control from the end table, and idly switched on the cd player, having pre-set it to play song number twelve from the cd Jesse had insisted she pick up. Nabiki wasn't a big fan of the artist, but agreed with her best friend in the U.S. that the woman still knew how to put together an exellent make out album.<p>"You weren't gone long," Nabiki stated, gently gathering Ranma in her arms, encircling his waist.<p>Falling into the theme of things, Ranma loosely put his arms around her neck, but let her lead, "It wasn't going to be that long, I told you that before I left."<p>"I know, but it was still a surprise to see you back so soon," Nabiki replied, slowly swaying, and ensuring Ranma followed her rhythm. "You could have at least told us you were returning already."<p>Ranma chuckled, and leaned down to kiss Nabiki on the cheek, "Well, I wanted it to be a surprise."<p>"You..." Nabiki mock admonished, "You know? You said you would teach Jesse that new form when you got back..."<p>"Ah... I did, didn't I?" Ranma replied, chagrinned, "You... think she's ready for it?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, "You're her instructor."<p>"But you're her mother."<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes, "If you want to play that game, you still have senority over me. That would be two positions you hold to my one."<p>"I'm not taking more than my fair share of her, Nabiki." Ranma responded, firm enough to get his seriousness across.<p>Nabiki leaned against his chest, "I know, that's just one of the things I love so much about you, you know that?"<p>Ranma smiled gently, flattered by the praise. He changed the subject, before he got too emotional about it, "New cd?"<p>"Mmmhmm," Nabiki confirmed, "You like it?"<p>"It's American? Don't know enough English to really understand it."<p>"'How I wish it was you, calling me. How I want it to be you, holding me. How it needs to be you, kissing me'," Nabiki began translating, "'Because it's like a seesaw when it comes to your love. Boy when you're up, this girl is down, and I just can't figure it out'."<p>Ranma grinned, hugging Nabiki to him tighter. He always thought she had a beautiful voice, "Been listening to this often, haven't you?"<p>Nabiki's smile grew bigger, "'You know that I want you, you know that I need you. Is that any way to be? Just have your way with me."<p>"Sounds like an invitation," Ranma commented, suddenly shifting, and then cradling Nabiki in his arms. The older woman chuckled, as her husband carried her to their bedroom.<p>Fin<p>(for real this time!)<p>_<p>_<p>WFROSE: Fork and shit, it's done. I'm gonna go get me something to drink. I'll answer any damn questions when I get back.<p>...<p>...<p>...<p>...<p>...<p>Wow... Ranma...?<p>Don't you dare, Nabiki<p>Yeah, sugar, this isn't the fic realm anymore!<p>Shampoo no have uncharactoristic compulsary to be nice nice to Nabiki anymore...<p>But you retain the uncharactoristic ability to utilize complex words, go figure.<p>Just kidding, just kidding, really! *Sigh*<p>Poor Nabiki...
