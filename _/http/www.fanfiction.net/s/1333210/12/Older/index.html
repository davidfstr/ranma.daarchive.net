</div>'Older'<p>Comforting<p>That would be the first word Nabiki would use, when considering Ranma's presence. The next would be 'welcome'. Much like the an ever-present calming influence, the older woman had become to cherish the pigtailed martial artist's company. Since the dinner date, strictly ploutonic date, she found things much more relaxed between them. There were still moments where they fumbled about between each other, but they were easily made up.<p>Perhaps it was because they had an understanding of how to contend with each other; of what the other possibly expected. Mannerisms that had unwittingly grated on one another seemed to become more of nuances or quirks, a few of them even going as far as to become 'adorable' traits, such as the way Nabiki rather began to enjoy Ranmas rough and frank speech, or how Ranma found himself less minding the way Nabiki seemed to brush up against him without realizing it.<p>From the sidelines of it all, Shampoo could only smile. It was probably only a matter of time, she thought. Unfortunately, she could only stall her great-grandmother so long, before the old woman decided to stick her hand into things. If that happened, there's no telling how events would spiral out of control. As luck had it, her elder had been much too busy check up on things, relying on Shampoo's dutiful reports for her information.<p>The young amazon had to admit, though, there was a slight pang of jealousy from observing the two, musing that what they unwittingly began sharing could have been hers to share with Ranma. It wasn't that she ever disliked him, but she just found him such a... foreign subject from what she thought she could ever be used to. If circumstances had been different, she probably would have forced herself to consider only his best points in order to find his appeal. If things went awry, she may still have to...<p>Ranma noticed the peace that had settled over everything since Nabiki insisted they broke down the walls between them. If she was willing to try to get along with him and try her best to be his friend... well, he couldn't say that he's had too many friends over his life, and it would be nice to have one he could possibly even stay in touch with, when the whole ordeal was over.<p>He had to think on that. There was no telling when his and her father's presence would  was one thing Ranma knew about his father; when Genma wanted to hide, he knew how to hide well.<p>It was pointless trying to convince his mother to allow him to move in with her. He half-expected that she may not be able to fully support herself and him at the same time, but that would be giving her too much credit. The simple fact was she was pushing him into a 'relationship' with Nabiki, which both agreed would never come to pass. Nonetheless, as much as he loved his recently newfound mother, she was nearly intolerable on the subject. He didn't appreciate the 'old woman' backhanded remarks she tended to make about Nabiki, either, even if he realized she wasn't purposely doing it out of any spite or malice.<p>With the pressure to Ranma and Nabiki coming from his mother, he wasn't blind to the internal one, either. Shampoo was much more subtle than Nodoka, but she was just as forceful. It rose his suspicions when Shampoo steadfastly refused to go that evening with Nabiki and Ranma out to dinner, but it really began to add up with the sudden disappearances of the amazon's presence whenever it seemed like Nabiki wanted to talk, or the 'helpful' suggestions Shampoo would offer that would put him on Nabiki's better side (not that he wasn't already on her good side, apparently).<p>His foot was also getting rather sore, as his ribs were starting to heal slower from bruising, whenever Shampoo was quick to interject when Ranma was about to comment in a way he could admit sometimes would be taken out of context. It was becoming a bit easier for him to figure out what would probably set Nabiki off. For instance, anything his mother would most likely say wasn't a good idea. Some thing's though, he couldn't help but ask about. Even if he knew it wasn't the most tactful, it was something that he knew would egg him until it came out of his mouth. Suprisingly, some of his questions were rewarded by her beautiful smile, or with her gorgeous, mirthful laughter. The rest of the time was replied to with a scowl that made him apologise quickly, or a curt and cold answer that made him wish she didn't alleviate his curiosity, and allow him to take the inquiry back.<p>He always felt bad about upsetting Nabiki, who seemed to go out of her way to look out for him. At that thought, he knew he had to return the favor, and one person he knew could be useful for such a plan. With that in mind, Ranma wondered where Shampoo had disappeared to, this time.<p>_<p>Kaoru sighed, as he fiddled with the empty beaker. Ukyo had told him that trying to approach Rachael directly would never work, and he was already pretty certain of that. The okonomiyaki chef suggested he find an excuse, any excuse to get within her presence, find out about her likes, her feelings... just be a real gentleman with her. At the suggestion, it also occured to Kaoru that he hadn't seen Ranma in quite some time. The reason he had gone over to Nabiki's that faithful day was to meet the older boy who had quickly become an idol to him, and found his red-headed goddess instead.<p>The young Ono paused to muse on that thought, he was starting to think like Tatewake. Thinking about the way he was feeling, maybe the Cassanova kendoist may know a thing or two that could help him. Of course, under no circumstances would he let the guy meet his hopefully destined paramour.<p>Nonetheless, he was eager to spar against Ranma again, and that provided the added bonus of getting near Rachael. Knowing the redhead's preference, he was positive there would be nothing between Ranma and Rachael. Of course, it could be problmatic if Ranma himself had some unrequitted feelings towards the girl. He would have to tread cautiously on that note.<p>Once again, Kaoru groaned. Why couldn't it be easy?<p>"Why couldn't what be easy?" Tofu asked, drying his hands with a towel as he walked out from the bathroom.<p>Kaoru grinned nervously, had he said that out loud? "Ah, just thinking about things, Dad."<p>"Ah, well if you feel like sharing, I'm ready to listen." Kaoru nodded as his father walked past. This was going to have to be something he put his whole heart into. 'Converting' a girl like that wouldn't be easy, but as Ukyo had told him, if he could only just get her to notice the charming young boy that was pining after her, he would at least have a leg in the door. Soon, it would be time to make the first move.<p>_<p>It unnerved Ranma, but it almost seemed as if Shampoo had been... expecting his inquiry. Her smug, knowing smile and relaxed posture that spoke of control in the situation did little to take Ranma off-edge, but the one person he could probably go to without everything getting blown out of proportion (well, further than it was already), was the girl in front of her. "Well?"<p>Shampoo cutely tilted her head to the side, looking up at the ceiling from where she was seated in lotus position, "I want make sure, you want thank Nabiki for nice, yes?"<p>"For being nice, right," Ranma clarified.<p>"Is easy, kiss Nabiki."<p>Ranma stared flatly, "What?"<p>"Kiss Nabiki, is too, too simple. No surprising you no think of it."<p>"I'm not about to... to kiss Nabiki," Ranma retorted, almost with a sullen edge to his voice.<p>"Then give hug. No as good as too, too nice kiss, but make Nabiki feel appr.. app..."<p>"Appreciated?" Ranma enquired, dully, "I'm not about to hug that old... I'm not going to hug her, that would, um... feel awkward."<p>"Ranma prude, is you knowing that?" Shampoo replied, resignedly; maybe it was good she didn't start out with the first suggestion that came to mind. Of course, she knew that both of them just weren't ready for that.<p>"I just like... girls my age, alright? Now lay off of it!" Ranma snapped, feeling a bit cornered in the conversation, now.<p>Shampoo simply shrugged, and turned around in her seat, "If no want Shampoo help, Ranma is needing good luck make Nabiki happy."<p>"No! I mean, can't you come up with something a little less... well, just nothing intimate like that. I'm not going to go that far."<p>Shampoo turned to look at Ranma with an eyebrow raised, "But Ranma want go that far, yes?"<p>"NO! Stop it!"<p>Shampoo pouted, but thought of an alternative. With a devilish grin that she didn't allow Ranma to see, she suggested another one, "Cherry chocolate. Nabiki too, too much in love with chocolate."<p>"Uh, I guess," Ranma thought back to when Nabiki gave him a drink, and blushed a bit at the recollection. She said the wine she was sharing with him tasted like...<p>"You mean cherry cordials?" Ranma enquired, trying to clarify what Shampoo was suggesting.<p>"Is correct!" Shampoo beemed, rather delighted that Ranma at least somewhat payed attention to some things about the older woman. Shampoo closed her eyes and tilted her head back to continue in a wisdomed tone, "Is only one place get Nabiki too, too favorite cordial."<p>"Um..." Ranma mentally counted how much he had in funds, "How much do they cost?"<p>Shampoo paused, that wasn't something that Jesse had mentioned, "Shampoo no know... I don't know."<p>Ranma huffed, "Well, at least you can tell me where to get 'em, that way I can at least go check them out."<p>"Is New Sanno Hotel, in Azabu district. Here, Shampoo have map..."<p>Ranma blinked, taking the readily drawn map from Shampoo, "Uh..."<p>"Ranma no American, so no get in. Ask guard page Jesse Summers. She too, too happy to help you!"<p>"Um, if you had this all prepared already, why didn't you suggest this before?" Ranma enquired, while his head was still spinning slightly by how quickly the information was supplied.<p>"Oh! Shampoo go now! Too, too late go help Great-Grandmother!" Without answering Ranma's question, Shampoo quickly darted out of her own guest room, leaving Ranma blinking in confusion and a little suspicion.<p>Once Shampoo was out of Ranma's proximity, she quickly went into the living room to retrieve Nabiki's home cell phone, before rushing out the back. She may have given Ranma the only copy of the map Jesse supplied for the Amazon, but she knew well enough to memorize Jesse's phone number from it...<p>_<p>Kasumi sat on the rear patio of her family home, sipping a steadily cooling tea as she looked out into the back yard. She was vaguely surprised that she hadn't heard a word from her youngest sister since the phone call several days ago. Knowing Akane well for nearly her whole lifetime as her sister, it was expected that with Akane's notorious temper and her healthy bank account, she would be on a plane even before they finished their conversation. The youngest the Tendou sisters was easily the most protective of them all, and would go to great lengths to ensure that her family never came to harm, be it physical or emotional.<p>Kasumi knew that Akane saw the potential hurt that would come to Nabiki for opening herself to Ranma; it would be a trauma that would easily rival her own divorce, no, easily surpass it. Worse, it would be a blow to Nabiki similar to one she had gained all those years ago that kept her from taking a steady suiter even till now.<p>A serious relationship that nearly crippled Nabiki emotionally and spiritually, one that died because of a mistake that was not of Nabiki's making; her only mistake was giving her trust. A man of idealistic proportions turned out to be a man of false values.<p>It was almost humorous, how Nabiki seemed to be the most 'innocent' of the three sisters, when it came to relationships, before the incident. Akane in high school had been persistantly hounded by onslaughts of boys, and while it wasn't like they were lining up in the schoolyard before classes started in an attempt to beat her into submission for a date, Akane became somewhat guarded on her interests.<p>Kasumi herself, well, she wasn't *quite* as innocent as she pretended to be during those days. She wasn't promiscuous, but she had experience in the field before she married Tofu. Because of this, she was a bit more privy to the baser natures of the opposite sex, and often found it left much to be desired.<p>Nabiki, as a contrast, had been reletively naive about guys. She had managed to hold onto idealistic fantasies, despite her intelligence and sarcastic nature. She knew what she wanted in a relationship, and in her scant few dates, once she found a potential boyfriend lacking in certain traits, she shunned them subtly by attempting to milk them for all they were worth. Eventually they would decide courting Nabiki was far from worth the effort or their wallet, and she would be free to move on.<p>Like that one young man, the one that had such a vibrant interest in exotic climates... Kuno, Kasumi recalled. He was rather persistant in dating Nabiki to the point of manic obsession. Kasumi concluded the reason he put up with her so long. Eventually, he himself found someone willing to give him more attention than for his bank account, and Nabiki didn't put up anything of a fight in an attempt to stake her claim.<p>Back to the problem at hand, Kasumi wasn't sure her sister could take another telling blow to the heart. It amazed the eldest Tendou sister that Nabiki kept her optimisim and sensual enjoyment of life after such a powerful betrayal. It was testament to Nabiki's will, and a trait Kasumi often times found herself admiring in her sister. Perhaps if she were able to look at life the way Nabiki did, she wouldn't be a statistical single mother.<p>Kasumi snorted at the idealism. Lands buried in the sands of time, no use lamenting over what should have, what could have, or what may have happened. At the present, Nabiki was falling into a relationship that wasn't *taboo*, per say, but easily could hurt her reputation, honor, and herself irrepairably.<p>Taking her second sip of her beverage within the last half hour, Kasumi quirked her lips in distain at the cold tea. With a sigh, she forced a smile across her face that may have actually been sincere, "Maybe it will all work out in the end."<p>She took out the last cigerette from the pack that had been sitting nearly empty by her, brought it to her mouth to hold gently between her lips, and efficiently lit it without fuss. With experience backed by years of practice spurned on by life's small and large disappointments, she inhaled the fumes from the carthogenic, and exhaled without a thought.<p>_<p>Ranma frowned at the gate guard, as the man no more than possibly two years older than the martial artist stared at him expressionlessly. It wasn't a difficult request, just let him in so he could talk with this Jesse Summers woman. It had been a rather strenuous trip, and Ranma wasn't in the mood to put up with being denied.<p>The biggest obstacle, of course, was communication. No, the gate guard spoke Japanese rather well, most likely why he was selected for the post, he just failed to communicate with Ranma.<p>"I cannot allow you access. If you want to contact personell within, I'm afraid it would have to be through other means."<p>"And Im tell'n ya that if I could, I would!" Ranma retorted, almost at his wits end, "Look, she isn't answering her cell phone, so all I want to do is see her so I can talk with her."<p>"And you are failing to understand that without permission, you are not allowed on these grounds," the guard replied, allowing a little of his fustration into his voice.<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes, "Fine, I'll just find another way." Ranma thought he was being cryptic, really.<p>The soldier squared his jaw, "Unlawful access into this establishment brooks severe penalty."<p>"Yes, son, so it would be best if you didn't do anything stupid."<p>Both Ranma and the soldier turned to find a man in a more elaborate and more formal uniform. Ranma stared defiantly, as the soldier quickly went into salute. "What's it your business?"<p>Almost chuckling, the man gave Ranma a nod in greeting, "I came to check up on what I was told was a persistant situation." The higher ranking officer nodded to the soldier, signaling that he could relax, "Barns, what's going on here?"<p>"This kid's trying to get in, sir," the soldier identified as Barns replied, as he dropped into at ease stance.<p>Ranma gave the guard a sharp glance, not appreciating the 'kid' remark, "All I'm try'n ta do is talk to this woman so I could get these chocolate things from her! But this jerk here won't even let me see her."<p>"This girl is in temporary residence of this hotel?" the officer enquired, "Do you know her name?"<p>"Summers, Summers Jesse."<p>The man's eyebrows climbed to his forehead, as the gate guard stared on, dumbly, "She's one of the employees of the BX. What did you want with her?"<p>"I'm supposed to pick up something for... a friend, alright?" Ranma replied, fighting back a slight embarrassment.<p>The officer put two and two together, and groaned, "Damn it, I warned that woman about supplying goods from the BX onto the local economy. I'm going to have to have that discussion with her again, a lot of help it'll do this time, too..." Rolling his eyes, the commanding officer continued, turning to Burns, "Well, why didn't you just page her to the gate?"<p>The guard went rigid, before starting to shift nervously, "It... it didn't occur to me, sir."<p>"Burns, it's not in our best interest to antagonize the local population. You were obviously briefed on the Marine incident in Okinawa, correct?"<p>"Y=...yes, Major Szlansky, sir."<p>Major Szlansky gave a non-commital grunt, before redirecting his attention to Ranma, "I apologise for this incident, young man, our friend here was just doing the job he believed himself to be assigned to." At the subtle suggestion Burns overstepped his bounds, the soldier nodded, "My apologies, sir."<p>"Well, I'm not the one you should be apologising to, but if this young man accepts it..."<p>"Ah, no harm done, I guess, but when can I talk to this Jesse Summers?" Ranma enquired, a bit more relieved he was receiving some headway, now.<p>"Well, once again, I would have to acknowledge that private Burns is correct," the major stated apologetically, causing Ranma's frown to return, "but I'll ensure that Mrs. Summers meets with you in a few minutes."<p>"Hey, great! That's all I'm really ask'n for," Ranma replied, showing a bit more enthuesiasm than he was really feeling at the whole ordeal. The major nodded, picking up the phone at the gate booth, well aware that he was ignoring the fact that the boy was still attempting to pick up items he wasn't privy to.<p>As the woman in question was being called to the gate, Ranma turned to Burns, pulling down one eyelid and sticking out his tongue. Indignantly, Burns shifted his eyes away, muttering under his breath, "Brat..."<p>_<p>Akane glowered, as she commanded the two combatants to cease. It hurt, it physically hurt to watch them, couldn't they comprehend the reletively short choreography required for the scene? It wasn't as if they were novices to the moves being used, Akane took great pride in almost effortlessly melding diverse fighting styles, from Capoeira to arnis, into complex and vibrant fighting scenes. It was a talent that she gained from her own family martial art, Anything goes, and was one of her hallmarks; it was what kept her recieving calls throughout the movie industry. At the moment, she was working with an acrobatic Silat fighter and a Mexican Wrestler.<p>In the back of her mind, Akane knew what the real problem was, even as she was shouting angrily at the two actors playing at martial arts. They weren't recieving clear direction, they were probably being somewhat confused by vague descriptions of what Akane wanted them to do, as she attempted to piece their own fight scene together. Damn it all, she wasn't able to concentrate on the business at hand, thanks to family issues back in her home country.<p>There was nothing she had wanted more than to simply rush over to Japan, beat the crap out of the little letch that was attempting to abuse her sister's endearing nature, and then lay into Nabiki for being so trusting of a little punk like Ranma. Didn't she learn better from the past? Was Nabiki becoming that desperate? If need be, Akane knew several men that would perfectly fit Nabiki's credentials. Hell, she'd attempted to fix her up several times in the past.<p>Of course, that was the problem. They were all perfect for Nabiki, too perfect. It always probably reminded Nabiki of what she had happen to her, and the heartbreak, fustration, and worthlessness she felt. For months after that incident, Kasumi, their father, and Akane herself stood by Nabiki as she worked to pull herself together.<p>Akane stopped, and took a deep breath from her shouting, "Look, I'm sorry for yelling at you guys, but you have to work with me here. This scene needs to be done by evening, so they can film it in a couple of days, so I'm going to be getting into you guys, don't take it personally, okay?"<p>The two men nodded, hesitatingly, cowered by the infamous Akane Morningbreeze's temper. They each had heard stories, and even the hint of her irritated attitude was enough to unnerve them. From this talking down, they would ensure that they made no mistakes, lest they *really* make her mad.<p>Akane sighed internally. She apologised, but that didn't do much to alleviate the guilt she felt from taking her fustration out on them. She was currently the problem, and though they were novices, it wasn't much of their fault.<p>It had hurt too much to see Nabiki, her sister and a woman she had greatly looked up to, be broken down like she had been. Nabiki had been a basket case. She was forced to take leave from work by both her family and concerned employers, because she simply couldn't properly function. It was astounding how a situation, even as dire as it was, was capable of nearly destroying a person. It was even moreso amazing, when Nabiki bounced back, regaining her joy and heart through will and support, because it was nearly a complete recovery. Unfortunately, it wasn't a whole reccuperation, as she then subtly refused to trust her heart to any man.<p>Akane could empathize with her. The youngest Tendou daughter wasn't the most tolerant towards men, and it took a special man; one caring, patient, persistant, and perhaps suicidal enough to bother with the tempermental Japanese girl that had arrived fresh from across the ocean. Akane still didn't see what he found so special in her, but thanked the deities and fates that he did so. She could easily see what may have happened to her if she hadn't met her husband. While Nabiki was able to enjoy life, Akane most likely would have remained bitter, and gotten worse by the day.<p>Because of Nabiki's past experiences, and also from Akane's own slight idolization, she felt the great obligation to watch out for Nabiki in particular of her whole family. They may not have been close during their younger years for sisters, but Akane had vowed to rectify that years ago.<p>"Good, good, now slow it down a bit. They'll be speeding things up in editing, anyways. I'd rather you guys make sure the forms or solid than concern about making it look quick." Akane moved at an angle from where the two fighters were still holding their poses, awaiting what may be wanted for the next move, "I think they'll probably film the next part from this angle, that way they can provide with a good backdrop. I'm going to want something in the way of a rising attack that Auturo's going to have to do his diving roll towards me. What do you got, Frank?"<p>Frank thought about it, leapt onto his right hand, kicking both of his legs up, aiming his heels at Auturo's chin at the right side of his face. Auturo instinctually responded by doing a backhandspring away from the attack.<p>"That works, but aim at Auturo's right shoulder, that way he'll get out of the way easier. The camera's angle will hide the actual target of the shot, so it'll still look like you are trying to kick him in the head, got it?"<p>At the moment, thanks to the mixed blessing of Thomas's intervention, Akane was forced to remain in the U.S. instead of running gung-ho like some calvary of rightous justice; deathly resolved to rescue her sister from certain peril. She was sure she would rectify the problem with minimal effort, as any more than that would put Ranma in a coffin, and that she wouldn't make the situation worse, as Thomas alluded to. But, now that she had a few days to calm down, she decided that Nabiki would eventually regain her currently lost sanity, and take a step back from things.<p>"DAMN IT! I THOUGHT YOU TWO SAID YOU WERE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT COMPOTENT PRACTICTIONERS!" Akane shouted, before storming up to between the two fighters to let them have a piece of her mind.<p>_<p>Ranma stood nervously under the scruteny of the Black American woman, unsure of why she was studying him so intently. All he knew was that he was feeling more than a little like a side of beef.<p>"Ah..." Ranma started, breaking the nervewreaking silence, "Someone told me that you could-"<p>"Turn around for me," Jesse commanded, putting her hand on her chin.<p>"Huh?" Ranma responded.<p>"Turn, all the way around."<p>Hesitatingly, Ranma did so, but keeping his head generally in her direction so he could keep an eye on her until he was facing away from her. After completing the task, he heard her approaching, "Mmm, if any of my ex-husbands had a butt like yours, they wouldn't be exs."<p>Ranma's eyes went wide, as he jolted away from the pat he recieved on his backside, "HEY!"<p>"Don't worry, I don't think Nabiki'll mind a touch test," the woman replied in humor.<p>Ranma was about to retort, before pausing, "Wait, you know Nabiki... er, Ms. Tendou?"<p>"Whoops," Jesse muttered under her breath, realizing her slipup, "I was told by Major Szlansky that you were here for some cherry cordials. Only one person I can think of that comes here for those. Guess you're an errand boy." Enough of the truth to make that lie work.<p>"Oh," Ranma replied, buying the excuse, "How much are they, anyways?"<p>"Don't worry about it, save the money and take the girl out on a nice date," Jesse replied, waiving the question off.<p>"Hey! I ain't taking her out on a date! She's old enough to be my Mom, for cry'n out loud!"<p>"Hey, yourself! I know how Japanese like young'ns like you!" Jesse replied, before considering something, "Um... you're not into ten year old girls yourself, are you?"<p>Ranma's eye twitched just from the first stereotypical comment alone, "I'm not into any girls, period!"<p>Jesse baulked, before turning away from Ranma. "Oooookay... that would be a problem..."<p>Ranma baulked, realizing he should have thought before speaking, "I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!"<p>Jesse blinked, before turning back to Ranma, "You can speak English, too? I've come to the conclusion that most of you kids in this country forget it as soon as possible, kinda like Spanish in the U.S."<p>Ranma shrugged, "Not really, I know a little, since a lot of places me and Pop stopped at in China knew it, so it made bargaining for things easier. Just recognized the word 'problem', since Pops caused me more than enough of them."<p>"Oooh, cute, young and witty!" Jesse replied.<p>Ranma rolled his eyes at the obviously one track minded woman, "Anways, I'm not tak'n Nabiki on a date, so how much for these?"<p>"Kid, it's already taken care of. Forget about it!"<p>Ranma didn't even realize he was being given something for free, too incensed at the realization that she still thought he should keep the money to treat the old woman for a night on the town or something, "I ain't gonna take them if you don't tell me!"<p>"Geez, Nabiki already paid for them, alright?" Jesse brought her hands up while shrugging, "Like I said, thought you were just an errand boy or something."<p>"Do you think Nabiki is always so damn familiar with her 'errand boys'?" Ranma enquired, guardedly, "And if Nabiki's already paid for them, she can come pick them up, herself."<p>Jesse groaned in fustration; internally cursing the genetic code that bred the stubbornness in men, "Alright, just take that one to her, and I'll get another box. Gimme a second."<p>Jesse ran back through the gates, past private Burns, who was turning flush red from containing his laughter at the whole play before him. A few minutes later, Jesse returned, breathing a bit heavily, while the gate guard's face was still flush red.<p>Jesse glared at Burns, before handing the second box of chocolates to Ranma, "Here, okay?"<p>"How much?" Ranma asked, holding a somewhat defiant expression.<p>Jesse nearly screamed, before regaining her composure, "Sixteen dollars, about Two thousand Yen."<p>Ranma sighed; really, being given this much trouble over so little. The way she was acting, he would need to take out a loan or something.<p>Defeated, Jesse took the money. "Pleasure doing business with ya!" With that, Ranma somersaulted backwards onto a light post... that had been towering almost twenty feet over them, before leaping onto the top of a nearby crossing bridge that had been several yards away, and then onto the top of a nearby building.<p>Jesse had seen Nabiki's sister, Akane, and her nephew Kaoru perform similar stunts, and was only slightly less impressed than the gate guard. Even if she had seen it, he still managed twice the distance Kaoru did, while still easily surpassing what she had seen Akane do.<p>Shaking her stupor off, Jesse returned inside. Instead of a free box, Ranma got two for the price of one, in the end, it would probably work out better for him. Though, Jesse had to consider, did Nabiki really deserve to have to put up with him?<p>_<p>There was a tranquility about him, as he looked upon the Jilung He river during the growing dusk. Though the beauty of the glistening water, hued by reflecting the vibrant pink and orange sky, coupled with the soothing sound of flowing water provided more than enough asthetic pleasure to the senses, it wasn't what gave Soun Tendou his current peace.<p>It had only been a few weeks, but since he had departed, and the longer he had been gone, he felt more at ease with following his old training partner's plan. The Tendou patriarch was not a fool, and knew that attempting to set his daughters up with was about as sound a plan as rolling a handfull of packed snow from one end of Hell to another, but it sincerely wasn't even his true intention.<p>He had to applaud himself for his brilliant performance, his daughters often considered him a bit out of it, but loved him dearly and nonetheless. It took a great deal of dicipline not to show any sign of humor over the whole situation; to think, his daughters actually BELIEVED that he would push an engagement onto them with such a boy. Granted, he trusted Genma to have raised a young man with few peers, but there was only so far even he would believe the whole ordeal would go.<p>Nabiki, his precious daughter... well, they were all precious to him, but it was she he held the most concern for. Akane was married to a man that Soun was more than honored to call kin, able to provide for his youngest's happiness without fail or even falter. If there ever existed a couple that belonged together, they were proof to the theory.<p>Kasumi and Tofu's marraige had ended as a disappointment, but not before Soun's eldest daughter had gained two lovely sons that provided her with the greatest of purpose in life. Before her marriage with Tofu, he had feared where life would take her; she was far too great a woman to simply fall to the side, untaken. She had finished high school, and with hopes of attending college, but circumstances being as they were, fate obviously intended for her a different path, one that lead to the young chiropracter and family doctor that had been suggested to them by his mentor, and their first family doctor.<p>Because of Tofu, Kasumi was able to continue school for a degree in nursing which would provide her with opportunities well after her unfortunate separation from the man she had once loved. Even if she had gained a bit of Nabiki's old sarcastic edge (or it was always there, who could say), she found her life content.<p>Nabiki, a Masters degree, a profession that easily kept her comfortable, and would do so even beyond retirement, and little to worry about in life in general; she had gained very little in all her years.<p>All she had to show, everything she owned, it would amount to little in the end. She helped a great deal of people who would possibly forget her years down the road when their obligations to the company that Nabiki worked in were finished, and she did a great deal of charity that was taken for granted.<p>Soun himself knew what made someone successful. Earning all the money in the world, being the greatest martial artist that ever lived, or whatever, what he considered to be the zenith of a person's existance, was finding love fulfilled. In that, Nabiki's sisters had succeeded beyond his middle daughter, as Kasumi loved her children, and Akane loved both her husband and children. Even more important, they loved his daughters back. Even Tofu never stopped caring for Kasumi, even if she had deluded herself into believing such.<p>"Ahhhh, beautiful, isn't it, Tendou?" Genma's voice sounded from behind Soun, "Just the perfect backdrop for a sparring match between old friends, eh?"<p>"Indeed, Saotome," Soun said, having yet turned around. Nabiki, she had no one. Well, not quite true, as she had himself and her sisters, but there was no one for her to claim for her own. He imagined that she would have found someone at some point in time, if not for... him.<p>"You ready, Tendou?"<p>Soun took a stance across from Genma, dramatized by the light breeze that waved his hair and ruffled his gi, "I'm prepared, but go easy, Saotome, I have not had the opportunity to strenuously train as you had with your son the past decade."<p>Genma snorted, and took his own stance, "Don't be so sure, Tendou. If anything, the boy brought me down having to train him."<p>Soun chuckled at the boast, "Well, we will see, then? ENGARDE!"<p>There were few that Soun could ever truly come to hate. Even Happosai never instilled enough animosity in him; terror, perhaps, but not hatred. But this man, the one who would dare impudently use his daughter as he did, without regards to her while wearing a mask of sincerity and caring, this man was indeed worthy of Soun's hatred more than any other.<p>"Whoa! Nice one, Tendou!" Genma congradulated, as their initial tradeoff had forced the stout martial artist to break away, first. If there was one thing Genma had recalled, it was that the Tendous definitely knew how to put some 'omph' in their punches. At the realization he was probably putting a bit more into a friendly spar than necessary, Soun began to check himself, before beginning again.<p>Nabiki was always a strong girl, even in her youth. Easily as tempermental as her little sister, though she always expressed it through other means than violence, yet capable of as much compassion as Kasumi on her best days, Nabiki was an identifiable median of her siblings. All of that had made for a self-assured package that almost seemed impenatrable, invincible. Unfortunately, as all things, it could be softened by matters of the heart.<p>Betrayal is never an easy thing to deal with, and Nabiki had been betrayed in the worst way. For once, it seemed like Nabiki would be completed; the final one of his children to succeed, and allow him to finally rest in his concerns. Instead, he was left with the task of putting his daughter before anything else in the hopes that she wasn't totally lost. He had faith in her, and it wasn't misplaced.<p>Alas, the damage had been done, and even if she didn't realize it, Nabiki didn't trust men all that much... including her own father.<p>"Getting sloppy, Tendou!" Genma warned, stopping the edge of his foot just short of the bridge of Soun's nose.<p>"My apologies, my mind was elsewhere," Soun replied, before breaking away once again. It was subtle, but being his daughter, it wasn't something totally unnoticed to him. The wry comments and sarcastic overtones used while communicating with one another, and contact, despite not living that far from one another in this day and age, was sparse. Nabiki kept her personal affairs to herself, as far as he knew, and he rarely was able to garner much about her other than rudementary affairs.<p>Before, she had been much more open with what went on in their lives. When Soun idly brought up the change, Nabiki's excuse was that she had just been too busy. As time progressed, her evasions became more elaborate to the point he had to resort to dramatics in order to get her attention. How many times had he revised that damn Will of his?<p>The reason for the engagement? Nabiki, quite frankly, was the obvious choice. Akane was already married, and Kasumi would sooner cut all ties with the family before going along with a promised marriage. Nabiki also wouldn't honor it, but she would at least attempt to humor her dear father until she could talk sense into him.<p>Soun chuckled, earning a raised eyebrow from Genma, as they were locked in heated combat. Nabiki also was a manipulator, one accustomed to holding the puppet strings; Soun doubted if she ever knew what side of the family she had gotten that from. Akane had inherited her mother's openness, after all. He wouldn't have made it easy for her, assuradly, but just totally removing himself from the picture would work far better than his original plan, which was to cry and wail every time she brought it up that she and Ranma wouldn't marry.<p>Nabiki had to start once again to trust in herself, and trust the opposite sex. Any man her age would be far from innocent, regardless if they had a good nature or not. Genma's sixteen year old boy, hopefully, would be what was needed. Thanks to Kasumi's assistance, it was practically assured that Ranma would be staying with Nabiki, allowing for the two to better get to know one another. Nothing would come of it, but maybe, just maybe it would open the door for Nabiki. Maybe, just maybe, he would see his second daughter with a lifetime companion before he died. It was going to be difficult to explain to his dear friend as to why Nabiki and Ranma wouldn't be wed.<p>"I think that's enough, Saotome. I'm not quite as young as you are, dear friend."<p>Genma chuckled, and replied in teasing humor, "Quite right, 'Old Man' Tendou. You're getting on in your years!"<p>"Hmph, 'Old Man' Tendou, that's a nickname I hadn't heard in ages," Soun mused, before giving a bow to Genma, "Even the Master used to call me that..."<p>"You've gone insane?" Genma nearly shouted, "To mention *him*..."<p>"He had returned years ago, Saotome," Soun replied, tiredly, "Fortunately, he's amidst his own world tour. I believe he was jealous of Nabiki's sabbatical in Europe."<p>"Oh?" Genma replied, though shaken at the news that the Master had returned from imprisonment.<p>Soun nodded, "Nabiki, Kasumi, and Akane gladly paid for him to be gone for as long as possible. And each of them were able to make it a tax writeoff under the premisis of 'goodwill charity'."<p>Soun's mind drifted once again during his and Genma's shared laughter. It wasn't a fool-proof plan, but it was as secure as far as he could see. Just one thing had been nagging him, like there was a point he had missed. Hopefully, it wouldn't come up, and ruin everything...<p>_<p>Nodoka Saotome sat on her couch, glancing at the single tea setting she had made herself. As lonely as she was feeling at the moment, she had decided to allow Ranma and Nabiki their space for a few days.<p>She wasn't oblivious to the fact that she seemed to annoy them in some instances, but she couldn't help it; teasing Nabiki was fun! Nodoka liked Nabiki, and much would like the woman as a friend. Unfortunately, she wasn't sure how to relate to her. The last she had extensive contact with Ms. Tendou, she was only a business client. Now, she's a prospective Mother-in-Law.<p>Attempting to be formal with Nabiki was just awkward for Nodoka, and decided that maybe some light-hearted teasing would help the two grow as friends rather than as relations through a tenuous link through her son. Perhaps she should be a bit more cautious about her jibes, Nabiki did seem a bit self-concious of her age. The woman was only two years older than Nodoka, she really needed to learn to take a joke.<p>Regardless of her wanting friendship, there was one other predicerment she would have to deal with, and that was her priority. Nabiki and Ranma both deserved to be happy, and she fully intended to honor her vow of seeing the two wedded.<p>Nodoka picked up her cup of tea, and sipped it. Yes, Nabiki was a fine choice of a spouse for her manly son, why exactly where they so insistant of fighting fate?
