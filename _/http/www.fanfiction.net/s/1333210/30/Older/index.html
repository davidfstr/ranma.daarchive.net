</div>'Older'<p>Kuno hadn't had to work so hard in a match his whole life, much less a sparring match. No longer could he feign stoic concentration, as his face was now soaked in a deluge of sweat. His brow furrowed, as he forced himself to move his trusty bokken faster, willing himself firmly not to falter.<p>Kaoru, on the other hand, remained amazingly cool in his expression, even if he was just as drenched as his opponent. He demanded of himself his fullest potential, and when he reached it, forced himself through the elastic wall of his current limitations, until...<p>The kendoist's eyes widened, as he suddenly attempted to retreat, while moving to parry Kaoru's crescent kick. The attack cut through the wooden weapon as if it were brittle straw, striking Kuno dumb that his revered weapon was easily rendered useless. The young Ono planted the foot firmly into the ground, and completing his turn, brought up the other leg, tucking his knee up to his chest and keeping perfect form. He thrust his foot forward, slamming it into Kuno's sternum, and sending him careening into the wall behind him. The kendoist's impact shook the whole school kendo hall, causing some of the decoration to fall from supports. All this was completed before the sound of the wooden bokken snapping could even reverberate off the walls.<p>Holding his stance, Kaoru waited to see if Kuno would move. After no reaction, he finally relaxed. Now, perhaps now he was ready. At long last, he could finally challenge Ranma compotently.<p>But first a quick nap on the nice wooden floor for himself.<p>_<p>"Your mother's nuts."<p>Ranma blinked, and turned to look at Nabiki, "Uh... what brought that on?"<p>The middle aged woman shrugged, and leaned against Ranma's shoulder, "It's been a couple of days, felt like I needed to reiterate the point."<p>"Heh, yeah, that was weird," Ranma had to admit, still confused over the whole situation. "You think she knew all along?"<p>"Hmm, doubt it. Unless she caught you at a time neither of us would have noticed her, I don't see how she could have even known about the curse." Nabiki mused for a moment, "Although, it still is possible."<p>"I guess, she took it way too well," Ranma commented, shifting to get more comfortable in the couch with Nabiki against him, "And what was that 'four' thing all about?"<p>Nabiki turned to look up at Ranma's curious and wary expression, before she quirked a slight smirk. When Nodoka had asked Nabiki 'how many times', Nabiki gleefully responded. Sure, she embellished, and added the fourth one Ranma had given her in the morning, but she justified that it would only help his case.<p>"Don't remember," Nabiki responded, flippantly.<p>Ranma grew even more sceptical, "Yeah, right, since when did YOU not remember something?"<p>"I doubt it was anything important, hon," Nabiki easily replied, forcing Ranma sideways as she practically crawled onto him.<p>"Oh no, it's obviously something important if you're trying to worm your way outta *smooch*, HEY! I'm trying to- *smooth*, comon, this ain't fai-<p>Ranma gave up after the third kiss Nabiki favored him with, returning it. After a half a minute, Nabiki pulled away with a victorious smirk on her face. At the look, Ranma rolled his eyes, "You know? You useta be a lot more reserved..."<p>Nabiki shrugged, "You only have yourself to blame for that, hon."<p>"Great, just great..." Ranma replied with mock exasperation, earning a chuckle from Nabiki.<p>"You're not actually *complaining* are you? Most guys would give anything to be in your position. I mean a woman with her own income, healthy sexual appetite, a limber body, a BMW a boyfriend can drive... when he gets his driver's liscense."<p>"Yeah, every guy over fourty," Ranma retorted, wryly.<p>Nabiki's smirk cracked, as sne snaked a hand towards Ranma's stomach, caressed it, then slammed her palm into it.<p>"OW! I'm kidding, jeez!" Ranma winced, but laughed, as he gradually wrapped his arms around Nabiki's waist.<p>"Make kid somewhere else, other people would like to share the couch!"<p>Both Ranma and Nabiki blinked, before turning to look up at Shampoo and Happosai looking down at them from the backrest. Almost immidiately, the couple sat up as if nothing had been going on. "Hey, when did you two get in?" Nabiki asked, casually.<p>"I returned just now, you two seemed busy," Shampoo replied.<p>"And I've been hiding against the ceiling to see if you two would do anything in here again," Happosai spoke for himself.<p>Ranma glared at a suddenly frazzled and blustering Nabiki, "I thought you said it was safe!"<p>"It's not like we finished in here," Nabiki mumbled in reply, folding her hands into her lap. Shampoo looked towards Happosai for an explanation, before she suddenly decided she didn't want to know; if she did, she would probably never sit on the couch again.<p>Tentatively seating herself next to Nabiki, while Happosai hopped down to sit next to Ranma, Shampoo picked up the remote control from the end table, "Watching a movie?"<p>"We weren't intending to, sis," Nabiki grumbled, accepting that the moment was lost for good. Resigned, she simply returned to leaning against Ranma. "You probably could have simply waited a while longer, you know? I'm pretty sure you could have busied yourself elsewhere."<p>"But you two so cute, sister!" Shampoo beemed, "It was fun watching, yes?"<p>"Indeed, aaaah, young love," Happosai mock swooned, liting his pipe.<p>Nabiki reached over, and took it from him, "What did I tell you?" she enquired in an arched tone, as the smoke eminating from it suddenly winked out.<p>Ranma noticed the frost building under the head of the pipe, "Hey, cool! How'd you do that?"<p>"Great Grandmother know such techniques, perhaps sister could teach me?" Shampoo enquired, mildly impressed, herself.<p>"I don't see why not, sis," Nabiki retorted, handing the cold tobacco pipe back to its disgruntled owner.<p>"You two have to keep calling each other 'sister'?" Ranma asked, irritated. They had been doing that since their discussion over the details of their new relationship. Ranma ignored it at first, but was now finding it grating to hear 'sister' or 'sis' in every other word.<p>Both women blinked at the pigtailed young man, before turning back to each other. "You have yet to teach your husband manners, sister," Shampoo commented.<p>Nabiki shrugged, "I like him this way, sis. And he has other attributes that more than make up for it." Nabiki grinned languishly in emphesis.<p>Shampoo tilted her head, thinking, "Perhaps, I could not know..." The lavender haired girl perked up, "Perhaps you share him, yes?"<p>Nabiki blinked, before turning to Ranma with a contemplative expression.<p>The pigtailed martial artist finally noticed the long pause, and turned from the TV to see what was keeping them quiet. After a double-take at his fiancee's expression, Ranma caught on, "HEY!"<p>Ranma frowned, as both Shampoo and Nabiki broke down laughing, "Ha, ha, it is so oh to laugh. Why don't we just put in a damn movie or something?"<p>"You have a matured rose of perfection, and a youthful orchid of exuberance contemplating every man's desire, and you want to watch a movie?" Happosai asked, dryly. Shampoo and Nabiki began to laugh harder. Ranma's frown turned into a scowl, as he sunk deeper into the couch. Choking down some of her laughter, Nabiki rubbed his stomach to console him, feeling him relax under her palm slightly. Eventually, Ranma returned to smiling again, albeit slightly.<p>Shampoo pulled herself from the couch, and headed for the DVD stand to pick something out, since everyone else didn't seem inclined to budge. Ranma looked around; the woman he loved against him, Happosai approving of the relationship, on a truly friendly basis with Shampoo, his mother knowing about his curse and not having any qualms about it, and his father was still gone.<p>"So, this is what a happy ending feels like?" Ranma asked, thinking about those painfully cheerful Disney movies Shampoo occasionally watched. Actually, they didn't seem as bad now. In unison, everyone else nodded once in agreement.<p>"Hmm," Nabiki put her finger to her chin, "Actually, I guess the story hasn't ended yet..." With a deliciously wicked smirk, the middle aged woman stretched, "Shampoo, just pick something out for you and Happosai. I think I'm tired enough to turn in for tonight."<p>Ranma blinked, before checking the clock, "But it's only eight."<p>Nabiki, Happosai, and Shampoo slowly turned to look at Ranma with blank expressions. Shifting his gaze to each of their faces, Ranma quickly caught on, "Oh, OH! I, um... guess I should turn in, too... or something."<p>With a snort, Nabiki pulled herself off the couch, dragging Ranma by the arm with her, heading for her room, "Just come on, before I decide I'm really tired..."<p>Unfortunately, she didn't run fast enough, as her cellphone on the end table rang. Deciding the call wouldn't take more than a 'call back later', Nabiki answered, "What?"<p>The other end paused from the curt reply, rather unexpected from the woman, before speaking. Nabiki for her part, groaned and closed her eyes; she had forgotten about this little issue.<p>"Deities... Ranma, it's for you." Between giving Ranma her utmost trust, and practicing prudence, she probably should have went with prudence, and hung up.<p>_<p>Kasumi was livid.<p>She had thought Nabiki would have stayed in her senses, but unfortunately, Kasumi had not realized the level of her sister's desperation. She had figured Nabiki really was content, after all, Kasumi would have swapped much of her life for what her sister had, and the only thing Kasumi would never have given up in her life were her two darling children.<p>For her whole life, Kasumi had her life planned out like an adorable fairytale fantasy; oblivious to what a true relationship invited. Looking back, she now understood what she had wanted in life, a marriage of convenience. Not one for her simple comforts, but one that everything fell into place comfortably; she had a loving husband, a doctor at that. Her two boys were the center of her life. She thought she would be content with simply remaining a homemaker, and for the most part, she was. Alas, there is always the sense that there was more for her out there.<p>Nabiki had that 'more' in spades, and Kasumi relished and envied her sister's success. Now, because of their own senile father's callous foolishness, the eldest daughter of the Tendou family had to bear witness to the painful downward spiral Nabiki was sinking into.<p>No, her father was only the catalyst, the young man standing across from her son as he warmed up, wearing a deceptively innocent expression was the driving force behind it all. He had even proven to Nabiki, without a doubt shown her his worth, yet not even a day later, she forgave him. Nabiki had practically lost her own respect, and given up her pride, and for what? A faux romance with some brat that had no respect for her wishes, privacy, or opinions whatsoever?<p>Kasumi didn't care about her father's ordinance, no smoking in the training hall. She could not talk either her son or Nabiki out of this nonsense, and she was pretty positive that *he* wouldn't listen to her. The damn little punk had no respect for anyone, as far as she could see. He got his jollies by either beating on her son, and leading him on wih that rediculous 'Rachael' alias. He enjoyed toying with her vunerable sister's emotions, playing up to her generosity for his convenience, and overindulged in her hospitality. And the worst thing about it all, both her son AND her sister knew this, yet happily took the abuse like a couple of massochists.<p>She looked over at Nabiki, who was confidently smiling, as if she already knew that things would work out in the end; since when did she become so pathetically naive? "Nabiki, stop this, now."<p>The middle Tendou sister merely crossed her legs, and reclined onto her elbows on the dojo floor, "It's not my right to stop it."<p>Kasumi, if possible, became even more fustrated at the answer her sister gave her once again, for the umpteenth time, "This isn't a request, Nabiki. Do you know what he's going to do to my son, YOUR nephew? You're willing to let your own blood take this abuse from your little recent boyfriend?"<p>Nabiki gave her sister a sideways glare, but refused to succomb to the bait. Kasumi was angry, possibly angrier than Nabiki had seen her in a long time. But, Nabiki also understood where much of her sister's anger and fustration originated from; Nabiki herself.<p>If Nabiki was intending to be with Ranma, she had to ensure things were finally set at ease with everyone involved. Ever the stratagist, Nabiki knew that courrying Kasumi's favor would go well to her advantage. And the first thing she had to do, was...<p>"I need to talk to you about that," Nabiki stated calmly, watching Ranma as he knelt on the wood floor, waiting for his opponent to be ready.<p>Even as low as they were whispering, Ranma caught their conversation. Regardless of how much consolation and support Nabiki had given him before hand, it still stung to know his fiancee's sister pretty much despised him. He hid his sullen frown behind an expression of almost obliviousness, pretending not to hear what they were saying.<p>Watching Kaoru, Ranma could tell the boy had been working out, probably too much, from the way he's stretching. He seemed unsatisfied with his stretch results, attempting to force himself further past his current flexibility. His muscles were probably extremely tight, which would inhibit him. Patiently, Ranma allowed Kaoru all the time he needed.<p>"I'm afraid it won't make much of a difference what your opinion of him is," Nabiki continued, turning away from Ranma to look directly at her sister. "but your opinion does matter to me, Kasumi. Believe it or not, to Ranma as well."<p>Kasumi snorted, flicking the spent ash from her slowly drindling cigerette into the ashtray she brought with her, "And how did he get you to believe that one? I used to think Akane was the naive one in the family."<p>Nabiki sighed, knowing it would be a difficult battle to get past her sister's bias. Much of Kasumi's opinion was instigated by Nabiki's own reactions. Playing the part of the confused, lovesick heroine from one of her cheesy romance novels didn't help Ranma's image in the least. Then, the whole misunderstanding between them and Shampoo had most assuradly firmed, and possibly in her opinion, validated Kasumi's animosity towards the pigtailed martial artist.<p>Now, now Nabiki was confident in herself, in what she and Ranma meant for each other, and where their relationship will go. To Kasumi, Nabiki imagined that she simply looked like a doormat, some hapless desperate woman well aware her biological clock is ticking, and latching on desperately to the nearest potentially willing man, a young man at that.<p>"Kasumi, I never asked you, why did you become so cynical?"<p>Kasumi blinked at the counter-question. Before she could answer, Nabiki got up, and walked to stand between Ranma and Kaoru.<p>Kaoru stared intensely at Ranma, not in a look of hate or animosity, but of determination and concentration. Ranma had to admit that his opponent came hunting for tiger today. "So, ya ready now?"<p>Kaoru nodded, then turned to Nabiki, and favored her with a nod. Nabiki paused at her nephew's expression, before turning a concerned one of her own towards Ranma. For Nabiki's eyes only, he allowed his confident smirk to slip, favoring her with a consoling one. Almost nagging herself for even allowing a fleeting doubt, Nabiki smiled at Ranma, before raising her hand between them. "Begin now!"<p>Nabiki almost didn't back away in time, as Kaoru immidiately ran on the defensive. Just like his youngest aunt when she was younger, he was quick to barrel down on an opponent; every intent to finish quickly.<p>Ranma was instantly flowing through Kaoru's attacks, but he could definitely see the improvement. At the ability he was displaying now, Ranma wondered if anyone had ever bothered to really push the younger boy to the furthest of his abilities before he arrived. The increase from even the last time they sparred to now was impressive, and Ranma couldn't simply mark it up to some miracle training regimen. The kid had potential. The problem now, was that the pigtailed martial artist could see that his opponent wasn't used to keeping up this level of activity. Like last time, he was going to burn himself out before Ranma even began to get started. As Ranma considered this, he unconciously began to dodge faster.<p>Kasumi stared at the fight with a tight lipped expression, as Nabiki came to sit right next to her, "I see nothing's changed about him."<p>"Ranma's right, Kaoru's a lot better than I figured," Nabiki replied.<p>That caught Kasumi off-guard, "What? Ranma's still making a fool of my-"<p>"Ranma's probably working harder right now than he had since Shampoo was actually trying to kill him," Nabiki stated, factually, "I guess Kaoru really did need a measure stick."<p>"Ranma's hardly a guage I want my son to be rated by," Kasumi quipped, before bringing her second cigerette to her lips, and taking a quick puff.<p>"Nobody's ever really tried to make Kaoru push himself," Nabiki continued on, "Though I don't agree with Ranma's methods with handling this, he at least... least..." Nabiki trailed off, after witnessing Ranma suddenly parry away one of Kaoru's attacks, and step in with a stiff shoulder, causing the younger boy to fly backwards a few feet.<p>Kaoru rolled with the attack, and as soon as his feet were back under him, he rushed at Ranma again.<p>"Doesn't seem like he's handling it any differently," Kasumi complained, barely restraining herself from getting involved with the match before her.<p>"Then you're not paying enough attention, sis," Nabiki stated with a smirk, "Kaoru's smiling."<p>Indeed, the young Ono was. For the first time in a long time, he felt as if he were sincerely going somewhere in the art. Merely training himself with kihon and kata, sparring with his aunts occationally, as well as his own father, Kuno, or his Grandfather, and conditioning gave him improvement, and improvement he could note, but it didn't give him he satisfaction of sincerely measuring it.<p>Ranma handled Kaoru like a live opponent; guaging him, yet never relenquishing any of his immense ability. At that moment, Kaoru realized that Ranma wasn't being condesending, or that he didn't respect his skills, the pigtailed martial artist was inviting him to cach up. Finding it now more of a game than deadly combat, Kaoru's smirk grew.<p>Kasumi wasn't amused at her son's newfound enjoyment. To her, it only went to prove how much he took after his father. "This has gone on long enough."<p>Nabiki was sure her sister meant more than the fight, but failed to acknowledge it, "Yeah, we should probably end his soon."<p>Kasumi almost commented on her sister returning to her sensibilities, just as Nabiki flicked her arm, laying her bra behind her on the floor, and then leaning up to unbutton the first three buttons of her blouse. "What are you doing?"<p>"Ranma," Nabiki called out, almost drolly.<p>"Huh?" The pigtailed young man replied, leaping back from Kaoru in order to spare a look at his signifigant other.<p>Nabiki sighed, as she leaned back onto her palms and rolled her head back in seeming irritation, "Remember what we talked about earlier..."<p>Ranma failed to evade to the fist into his jaw, the kick to side of the knee, the backfist to his temple as his leg buckled, or the thrust kick into his ribs, that sent him flying into the wall of the dojo. At impact, the heavy weapons rack on the very same wall collapsed, directly onto the pigtailed young man under it.<p>Kaoru lowered his leg, blinking and incoprehending of what just happened, "Ah... Ranma?" A groan was the only response given.<p>Nabiki sighed happily, as she rebuttoned her shirt, and watched her nephew suddenly panic, and rush to make sure Ranma was alright. "You're shameless, you know that?" Kasumi quipped, mildly amused at what just happened, but more out a guilty pleasure than the humor.<p>"I'll make it up to him later," Nabiki stated, slinging her bra over her shoulder as she stood up.<p>"What are you insinuating, Nabiki?"<p>Nabiki's face turned from playful to somber, "Kasumi, we're both big girls, we know exactly what I'm talking about. And before you pull the scandalized act, understand this; I love Ranma, and he loves me."<p>Nabiki turned away from her sister, heading over to assist Kaoru with tending to the dazed pigtailed boy. She paused after one step, "We both plan on honoring the pact between our families." Looking over her shoulder with a sad smile, Nabiki finished in an almost pleading voice, "If you really do care for my welfare, you'll pray us to prosper.<p>Kasumi watched Nabiki with an expression of immense trepidation, unable to disguise her expressed fear fear, as her sister walked away.<p>_<p>"That was dirty," Ranma growled, though half-heartedly.<p>Nabiki chuckled, stroking his forehead as she sat on the bed he was laying on, "I'm sorry."<p>Ranma snorted at the expression on her face; the cheerful, far from apologetic smile, complete with a peak of tongue escaping from between her lips, "No you're not."<p>"Mmm, maybe, but I bet the view was worth it, hmm?" Ranma glared at her, before looking around the room they were in. Obviously a guest room, from the sparse, impersonal decour of it, but from where wallpaper was slightly faded, he could guess it had been fully occupated before at some point.<p>"This used to be my room," Nabiki began, calming down, "Before I moved out. Then Kasumi's son used to have it, before they moved out."<p>Ranma tried to imagine what the room looked like when it belonged to Nabiki, and found his mind far from capable of conjuring up any possible image. "Hey, Nabiki..."<p>Nabiki turned back from the nightstand, where she was dipping a rag into cold water for Ranma's brow, "Hmm?"<p>"What were you like... when you were younger?"<p>Blinking at the question, the middle Tendou sister considered her reply. With a sigh, she decided to be honest, "I was selfish, I guess a little spoiled, more than a little insensitive..."<p>"I don't think I buy that," Ranma stated, firmly, as he folded his arms behind his head.<p>"What can I say? I grew out of it," the older woman replied, thoroughly wringing the rag out over the bowl of water, then placing it on Ranma's forehead, "When I was a teen, I used to dream about running some capitalistic empire that could even courry the favor of the big five. I liked handling money, lots of money, and I made lots of it through stupid things like gambling and blackmailing people. It was all some game, too, the whole thing. Didn't matter what everyone else got from what I did. Sometimes, I did it just because it was fun, for me at least."<p>Nabiki looked away, putting her hands into her lap, "You know what I did with that money?" Even if she couldn't see him, Ranma shook his head in reply. Before she continued, he put one of his hands on her hip in support.<p>Nabiki turned back to him, and gave him a wistful smile, before shifting her eyes back downward, "I barely even spent it. I usually swindled someone to pick up my tabs. Up until I was eighteen, I probably spent more on snacks than I did clothes. I usually borrowed those from Akane..." Nabiki then smiled wryly, "Even if the tops were a little tight on the chest..."<p>_<p>"I HEARD THAT!" Akane shouted, sitting up in bed suddenly.<p>"Heard what?" Thomas asked sleepily, as he rolled over to face his wife.<p>Akane blinked, realizing where she was, "Uh, sorry, I was just having the weirdest dream..." Akane looked down at her husband apologetically, earning a groan from him, before he rolled back over. Akane watched him, a bit peeved that she had to fall in love with such an insenitive jerk. Realizing she wasn't all that tired at the moment, she began to rub her finger coyly against the bedspead, "Tom... Tommy? You're not really that sleepy, are you?"<p>Thomas began to snore, as he peered back best he could with one eye and still turned away, hoping his dear, sometimes waaaayyyy too insatiable wife got the hint.<p>Akane growled, getting out of bed, and figured it would be a good idea to burn her late night energy off with some katas in the home gym.<p>"Jerk..."<p>_<p>"I wasn't the nicest person, back then. I used to use guys, and sent them packing after the first date, usually after milking them for all they were worth. Wasn't until college, when Akane called and told me her boyfriend proposed to her... Kasumi was already married to Tofu... that I realized I needed to wise up about my life. I started getting serious about the guys I saw, and met one that I thought would be *the* one." Nabiki chuckled, mirthlessly, "That didn't work out too well."<p>"Yeah, Happosai told me a little about that," Ranma replied, before he leaned up, and wrapped his arms around Nabiki's stomach from behind, and pulled her down on top of him.<p>"Ranma?"<p>"He also told me a little about what you were like when you were a lot young... er... a teenager. Doesn't match what you seem to think about how you were."<p>Nabiki remained quiet, not sure what the old man had said about her, so she was unable to refute it. Ranma held Nabiki tighter against his torso, rubbing his cheek against the side of her hair, "And you know? I think I wouldn't have minded meeting the teenage you. She sounded like she may have been pretty nice, once she let herself trust someone."<p>"Things weren't as simple as you make them sound, Ranma."<p>Ranma kissed her cheek, "Maybe, but you think I would have backed away from the challenge? And I guarentee that whatever happened, it would have been worth it in the end."<p>Nabiki nodded, begrudingly agreeing with her fiance`, as she put her own hands on the ones overlapping on her stomach, "I think I would have been happy with the results, too." Nabiki turned her head back towards Ranma, "I'm still happy now, though. As it is, I'm getting a second chance at my teenage years, thanks to you."<p>Ranma smirked, "Heh, you're welcome."<p>"Aunt Nabiki, is Ranma o..." Kaoru paused, finding his aunt and Ranma in an intimate embrace. The couple remained as they were, blinking owlishly at the young man.<p>After several moments, Kaoru recalled the 'engagement', "Um, you guys were serious... about...?"<p>After sharing a look between themselves, Nabiki and Ranma both looked back at Kaoru, and nodded. "Well," Kaoru replied, "this is awkward..."<p>With a sigh of resignation, Nabiki sat up out of Ranma's embrace, "Something you want, kiddo?"<p>"Uh, I just wanted to... well, ask why... Rachael didn't come to watch..." Kaoru blushed deeply, tapping his fingertips together in order to refrain from taking out his skeleton keychain; he thought he had conquered that habit. "You see, she kind of helped me train..."<p>Ranma groaned, as Nabiki chuckled; with everything else, Ranma had forgotten about his alter ego, while Nabiki had forgotten about Kaoru's little crush. "She had some things to do, and she apologised and wished you the best of luck," Nabiki answered, covering for her 'absence'.<p>Kaoru looked downcrested, before perking up, "It's not a big deal, really."<p>Even Ranma could see through the false cheer, hiding the younger boy's disappointment. Ranma's stomach sunk deeper, as he realized exactly how Kaoru felt towards his alter-ego. His eyes jutted up to find Nabiki's, their looks exchanging what was on their minds.<p>"I'll tell you what, Kaoru. She's not going to be doing anything tonight. Maybe I can convince her to hang out with you?" Ranma suggested, sitting up next to Nabiki.<p>It occured to him that if Ranma was interested in his aunt, he wasn't dating Rachael. Well, he doubted it at least; Nabiki probably wouldn't want to share, and she would have his head if he was doing something behind her back. Of course, that meant the rumors about the beautiful redhead's orientation may not be exaggurated. "That's okay, I don't think she was interested in me, anyways."<p>"Hey, it ain't like she would just forget her pals," Ranma stated, trying to bring the other boy's spirits up.<p>"Right... friends."<p>Nabiki did well not to break down in laughter, "Y-yes, she does like you... just not in that w-way. I... I think you two are going to have some things to talk about tonight."<p>Elated and terrified at the prospect of a 'date'with *her*, Kaoru began to giggle nervously, "Well, i-i-if y-you say s-so.<p>"Hey, would you mind getting some more cold water for me? Its starting to warm up, and Ranma's still swelling a bit around his chin," Nabiki calmly stated, holding he still cold and full bowl towards her nephew.<p>The young Ono suddenly became serious, "O-of course!" Quickly, he retrieved the bowl without spilling anything, and rushed out of the room.<p>Ranma looked suspiciously at Nabiki, "What swelling?"<p>"It was the best way to get him out before he lost it," Nabiki replied, "Ranma, I think tonight it would be best if you told him."<p>Ranma scratched his head, "Told him what?"<p>"What else? The truth about 'Rachael'," Nabiki answered, poking him in the nose.<p>"Ah... you sure about that?"<p>Nabiki pulled away from Ranma to look at him fully, "Ranma, this is going to become a bigger issue if we don't. Kaoru's family, and it's going to be pretty peculiar with him around if you don't."<p>"I guess," Ranma begrudgingly agreed, "I mean, if I could tell my mother, I guess the runt isn't gonna be all that big a deal."<p>_<p>Kasumi growled, realizing she had just gone through a second pack of cigerettes, since she retreated to her father's room. She remained sitting on her knees, snubbing the butt of the spent cigerette in the ash tray next to her, and wished she had an extra pack with her.<p>She just didn't know how to deal with the situation now. Before when Nabiki said she loved Ranma, Kasumi had the comfort that Nabiki didn't seem all that sure about it, herself. This time, she had said it with not simply unwavering resolve, but as if it were an undeniable fact that couldn't be changed.<p>Kasumi could not understand how Nabiki could so easily and willingly forgive Ranma after what had happened. Nabiki appeared in the early morning at the front door, completely crushed in spirit. A week later, she was reaking of confidence. To Kasumi, it was like watching an abused spouse, and in a way, she believed Nabiki was. Emotionally her sister had been battered, and then she was ready to come back for more while defending her abuser.<p>It hurt even more, as it was the fact that it was her own sister that was recieving the abuse. Several years ago, Kasumi and her still husband at the time, Tofu, assisted with an abused spouse situation. Kasumi couldn't bear the emotional drama that had ensued from the situation, and she felt almost as devistated as Mrs. Nakamura had. It scared Kasumi how accepting the woman had been of her situation, that she would give such unconditional love in irrational conditions. In the end, Mr. Nakamura had incriminated himself, and the law intervined on his wife's behalf. After that incident, arguments between Kasumi and Tofu started to become more noticable, and Kasumi eventually refused to partake in them. Tofu would never dream of hurting her, but Kasumi only had to remember Mrs. Nakamura, and...<p>Why would Nabiki let herself fall into such a situation? Nabiki was confidence personified, she was a source of strength, a model of independance that Kasumi herself admired. Now, Kasumi recalled Nabiki's tears falling into the murky cup of tea she held, telling her older sister how right she was about Ranma.<p>It was out of her hands, there was no way she knew she could convince Nabiki to reconsider her perspective; Nabiki was much stronger willed than Kasumi was, and the eldest Tendou sister knew it. Unable to bear the weight of the situation, Kasumi had to talk to someone, another party that cared about her sister as much as her.<p>Standing up, Kasumi approached the phone that lay by her father's bedding, picked it up, and dialed a long distance number that she would have thought she forgotten, if she hadn't called it so often recently. Twirling the cord nervously in her fingers, Kasumi waited for the other end to pick up, not even considering what time it would be on the other side of the world.<p>"[Hello?]" inquired the woman's voice from the other end, in English.<p>"Akane?"<p>"[Kasumi?]" Akane's drowsy responces picked up, "[Kasumi! Is something wrong?]"<p>The elder sister took a deep breath, and released it with a shudder. She was trying her best to hold it in, but if even Akane could pick it up that quickly, she was obviously more shaken than she could contain. "No, I don't know, I don't think everything's alright," Kasumi replied, virtually babbling, as her hand entwined rapidly with the phonecord from her jitters.<p>"[Is everyone okay? No one's hurt, are they? I'll be there as soon as possible if-]"<p>"Nobody's been hurt, nobody's hurt," Kasumi attempted to placate, though her own anxiety was making her statement sceptical, "It's just, just that... it's Nabiki, I don't know what to do!"<p>"[Kasumi, just calm down and tell me what's going on,]" Akane replied in an even, cautious tone, "[What's wrong with Nabiki?]"<p>"Nothing's wrong, well, yes there is, but she doesn't think... I don't... I just.."<p>"[Kasumi, I'm here, alright?]"<p>Kasumi closed her eyes, shifting uncomfortably as she sat, "She says she's in love with Ranma, really in love with Ranma, but she had come home in tears the other n-"<p>It was then that Kasumi heard the dialtone from the other end, not even knowing when Akane had hung up.<p>_<p>Ranma shifted nervously, sitting across from the young man 'she' had promised to meet, after a 'phone call' from Nabiki 'informed' her of 'Rachael' obligation. Truthfully, Ranma didn't mind it at all. In fact, she was more than happy to hang out with him, though she would have preferred to do it as a guy. What the problem lay in, was the news she had to break towards Kaoru.<p>Nabiki insisted that the jig needed to be up by tonight, because the middle aged woman said she would feel pretty silly if she apologised for her part the next morning, and her nephew didn't know what she was talking about. Nabiki had promised that once the task was done, she would be doubly indebted to Ranma that night. The redhead wasn't sure what Nabiki meant, but she was more than eager to find out.<p>Kaoru chuckled nervously at the silly grin that appeared on Rachael's face, fighting himself furiously to retain control. First, he couldn't believe he actually not only hit Ranma, but practically laid him out. He knew it wouldn't happen again... ever, but he was sure he definitely had Ranma's respect for his abilities. That was more than enough for him. And now, he was sitting across from the most beautiful girl he had ever been priveleged to lay eyes to in a nice restaurant, on a date paid for, compliments of his Aunt Nabiki. Nabiki had told Kaoru that he and Rachael had a lot to talk about, and that when they were done, she had a little to say to him too.<p>Nabiki didn't have to look so apologetic, he knew that Rachael wasn't inclined towards him, so he wouldn't lament about it. It was simply enough for her to pay attention to him. "S-so, is the f-food okay here?" Kaoru asked, barely keeping his studdering to a minimum.<p>"Oh, uh, I've never eaten here before," Rachael stated, distractedly. Even in her somewhat aloof state, she was aware of the boy's high level of nervousness. In fact, that was the cause for her distraction, and the second part of her problem. She had just realized that Kaoru liked her...*really* liked *her*. The queasiness at the realization lasted only for a few moments, before considering his point of view; after all, Ranma did know she was a pretty hot number. Nonetheless, it was still unsettling for a guy to be that affected by 'her'.<p>"O-of course, silly me, heh heh..."<p>Ranmam didn't quite find the humor her 'date' did, sighing to herself, "Hey, Kaoru, mind if I ask you a question?"<p>"ACK! I mean, o-o-of course! I'm all ears... I mean... all answers! Hahahahahaaaaaa..."<p>"Why are you, um, why do you like me... in that way? It's not like we really seen much of each other, I mean."<p>"Why?" Kaoru asked, incredulously, completely flabbergasted out of his nervousness, "Any guy who takes a good look at you wouldn't stand a chance! The first time I saw you it was like the Sun Goddess had descended upon us, her fiery mane glistening with cherishable warmth to relish and savor. I was blinded by your beau-"<p>"Shut up, please," Ranma interjected, very uncomfortable with the gushing praise. "But, um, don't you think I act like a bit too much of a tomboy? I... I mean most guys prefer girls that don't act like guys..."<p>"Rachael, that does nothing to diminish how beautiful you are," Kaoru retorted, finding that pouring out his heart was becoming easier as he went along, "If anything, it only enhances it, like you are bursting with exuberant energy."<p>"Exuber-huh?" Ranma asked, before shaking her head to dismiss it. Kaoru wasn't making what Ranma wanted to do any easier. "Listen, there's something I gotta tell ya..."<p>Kaoru gave Ranma a sad smile, holding up his hand to forestall her next reply, "It's alright, I already know."<p>Ranma blinked, "Huh? You do?"<p>With a resigned sigh, the young man nodded, "I know you don't like guys, the way I'm interested in you. I just wish that you will at least allow me to be your friend." After his speech, Kaoru picked up his now luke warm cup of complimentary green tea; he needed something to wash down the large lump he had just suddenly built in his throat.<p>"Huh," Ranma replied, finding the weight completely lifted from her, "So you already knew I was a guy. Nabiki made too big a deal of thi-"<p>::PPPfFFFTTTTT::<p>Kaoru's eyes went wider, as he realized what he just did, while still shocked from what he had just been told. Ranma kept her eyes closed, as she calmly picked up her napkin, and wiped her face off.<p>_<p>Ukyo cleaned her grill, content for her moderatly paced evening. It hadn't been all that busy, but she had easily earned enough for the night that she didn't have to sweat her business. Things were quaint in Nerima, and even if she no longer was in pursuit of revenge, she was satisfied enough with the area to remain.<p>Checking it's temperature to make sure it was thoroughly cooled, she ran a quick burst of water on it, and wiped it clean. Things were nice, unfortunately, they were also a little on the dull side.<p>"YOU!"<p>Ukyo didn't look up immidiately, "Sorry sugar, we're closed for the ni- Kaoru?" She looked past the boy, and found Ranma entering, his anxious and concerned expression showing he had expected something to happen that wouldn't be good for anyone. "Something up?"<p>"Ukyo..." Ranma almost sighed, a bit irritated himself at he revelation he had gained from Kaoru. What Ukyo had to gain from coaxing the young Ono on, the pigtailed martial artist couldn't comprehend.<p>Ukyo looked between Kaoru and Ranma, before realizing Ranma was currently male, "Knew what?"<p>"Ukyo, he knows about 'Rachael', Ranma clarified, "I told him not too long ago..."<p>The young chef started to speak, before the words caught in her throat, just as she had been red-handed. "Oh," was all she uttered, before she closed it.<p>"You were trying to set me up on dates, acting like I had some chance, just so you could laugh at me!" Kaoru snapped, "laugh at both of us!"<p>"I wasn't doing it to upset you, I-"<p>"Well, that's what happened," Kaoru interjected, "How could you? I thought you were my friend!"<p>"But... it was just a prank!" Ukyo attempted to downplay the situaion, "I didn't think it would harm anyone!"<p>"Ucchan, you-" Ranma started, before he was cut off.<p>"Don't you dare 'Ucchan' me, Ranma!" Ukyo barked, "This is all your fault, anyways! If you had just told him in the first place, it wouldn't have gotten this far!"<p>"Don't you dare try to blame him!" Kaoru interjected, heatedly, "You know how embarrasing it was for me? For the both of us? Ranma wanted to keep his curse as quiet as possible, and you took advantage of that!"<p>"Well, turnabout is fair play, isn't it, 'fiance'?" Ukyo countered, glaring at Ranma.<p>"What?" Kaoru questioned, thrown off kilter.<p>"You want to talk about embarrassing? How about people taking advantage of others? Just ask your pal about how he and his worthless father tricked my Dad out of my dowery, and abandoned me on the side of the road like I wasn't worth their time!" Ukyo realized her voice had climbed to screaming, before forcing herself to quiet down. The effort only replaced rage with hurt, "So before you go condeming me, talk to Ranma first."<p>"Ranma, what in the world is she talking about?" Kaoru finally asked, and turned around to find him cowered and becalmed.<p>"That really how you feel, Ukyo?," Ranma asked, subdued.<p>"Damn right that's how I feel!" Ukyo snapped, "You think I can just simply get over that?"<p>"But I thought you forgave me for-"<p>"Forgave, maybe, forget, no, you jackass! I spent ten years of my life tracking you down! And even if I'm willing to try to save any potential friendship we might have shared when we were seven, I'm not simply going to white out what happened!"<p>"Hmph, how petty of you," Kaoru spoke up, "So you thought you could use someone who trusted you to get back at him. Maybe Ranma did right to leave you-"<p>"Kaoru," Ranma almost whispered the name, but it still had enough potency to cease the other boy's rant. Once he was sure he had the attention of the other two, Ranma gave Ukyo an apologetic frown, "I can't apologise for my pops, because he ain't gonna care. But I... I'm sorry, more than you realize. I had thought when we met again that we could go back to simply being best buds..." Ranma turned away, "There's... nothing I can do about it now, and I won't hold this whole thing against you, because I guess I deserved it. You should apologise to Kaoru, though. He didn't deserve to be dragged into this."<p>"Ranma, she didn't have to do this in the first place," Kaoru interjected, "I'm the youngest one here, and I have to say this was completely childish of her!"<p>Ranma nodded his head, "Still, it doesn't excuse what I did to her first." With a deep breath, Ranma continued, "I can't do anything about the engagement between us, Ukyo, I'm sorry. My Pops ditched the cart almost a day after. I can't marry you either since... since there's someone else I love."<p>"That's right, just leave me with nothing, like you did ten years ago," Ukyo shouted out, in tears now; from both emotions that had been upturned from their graves, and the betrayal she felt as she was losing Kaoru as a friend.<p>"I-I'm sorry, I'll think of something to make it up to you, but I'm really..." Ranma didn't finish, as he suddenly bolted, stopping just long enough to swing the curtain over the exit out of his way, and leapt onto the rooftops across the street.<p>Ukyo watched Ranma's departure with a tight lipped expression. She should have been glad that the jerk understood what she really felt now, that she had finally gotten the chance to hurt him as much as he hurt her. But, all she could feel herself was hollow; a hollow victory wasn't satisfactory in the least. Not only that, she was sure things between her and Kaoru wouldn't be the same.<p>Finally gathering her courage, Ukyo spoke up, "Kaoru, I-"<p>"Don't... just... don't bother." Without even turning around to look at her, the young boy walked out of the restaurant, feeling queasy for the second time that evening.<p>With a shuddering breath, Ukyo braced her palms against the counter, willing herself to keep from crying. Things had been pretty dull in Nerima, but now it looks like they're going to be pretty lonely too.<p>_<p>Nabiki came to investigate whoever entered the front door, finding Ranma quietly removing his shoes, "Ranma, you're home early." She could already guess things didn't go well between him and her nephew. If she recalled the criteria she had planned for them, they should have went to see a movie about thirty minutes ago.<p>Her concern grew to its limits, as Ranma looked up at her. He wasn't crying, probably considering it too unmanly, but she could see he was wrecked emotionally.<p>Ranma offered Nabiki a weak smile, "Hi, I know you had something planned for tonight, mind if we skip it for now, I kinda just want to be alone right now," Ranma stated, softly.<p>Nabiki shook her head slowly and subtly, "I'm not leaving you alone, Ranma." She strode to and beside him, placing her hands on his shoulders to guide him along, "We can talk in my room, alright?" Not having the energy to resist, Ranma obediently followed.<p>They passed Shampoo and Happosai sitting on the couch, watching 'The Lion King', gaining their attention from the movie. Both guests could see that tonight would be best spent elsewhere.<p>"I think I shall go to the restaurant before it is too late. Help father prepare for tomorrow," Shampoo stated, stopping and turning off the Playstation 2 that they were using as the DVD player.<p>"And I have a long night of rescuing my silky darlings ahead of me," Happosai replied, though not carrying the usual entheusiasm. With their tasks decided, both retreated from the house, leaving it's owner and her boyfriend alone for the night.<p>_<p>Thomas stood in front of the exit of his and his wife's home, staring at Akane defiantly. Mrs. Morningbreeze shifted the travel bag a bit and glared back, far from in the mood to deal with her husband's admirable backbone, "Move."<p>Thomas was well used to his wife's temper, and learned over the years they had been together how to avoid it's painful side effects, if not curb it completely. Dealing with Akane had become an easy enough task for the most part.<p>But at the moment, she was doing that scary blue aura thingy.<p>"Have a safe trip, dear. Call us when you arrive, or the kids and I will worry," Thomas said, before kissing his passing wife on the cheek.
