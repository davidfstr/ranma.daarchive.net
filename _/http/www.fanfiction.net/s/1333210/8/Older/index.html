</div>'Older'<p>"Shampoo..."<p>Nabiki shook her head, "'I', Shampoo, don't use your name."<p>Shampoo gave Nabiki a cross glare, before correcting herself, "I am too, too tired."<p>Nabiki shrugged, as she unlocked the door to her home, and stepped in, "Well, we needed to get a lot of stuff done for you today." Nabiki let Shampoo in, while the Amazon kept her attention on Nabiki. The older woman stepped in behind her, closing the door and continued to address the lavender haired girl, "It's better that we got this all done sooner so there wouldn't be less chance of problems ari-ACK!"<p>Both Shampoo and Nabiki jumped, after turning around, and finding Nodoka standing before them with a greeting expression. "Welcome home, daughter-in-law..." Nodoka towards the younger girl, "Are you going to introduce me to your foreigner friend?"<p>Shampoo gave the woman a flat, hooded glare, as Nabiki closed her eyes at the woman's tact. "Nodoka, this is Shampoo. An... aquaintance of your son's. Shampoo, this is Nodoka Saotome," Nabiki paused with an 'i told you so' look, "Ranma's mother."<p>Shampoo blinked, and then looked back to Nodoka.<p>"Pleased to meet you," Nodoka greeted with a bow. Shampoo shifted her eyes back to Nodoka, and spoke in Mandarin. At whatever was said, Nabiki was forced to snap her mouth shut, as she almost burst into laughter, and began to make choking sounds.<p>"Oh, dear, are you alright? Need some water?" Nodoka enquired, watching the older woman with concern.<p>"N-no... j-just something down the wrong pipe..." Nabiki quickly answered, "'Scuse me..."<p>Briskly, Nabiki ran to the bathroom, leaving Nodoka alone with Shampoo. "So..." Nodoka started, attempting to break the ice, "Are you to be my son's first mistress?"<p>_<p>"Hey, Sugar," Ukyo greeted, as Kaoru walked into the old tappanyaki restuarant that Ukyo was currently renovating, "Come to offer some more help?"<p>"Sure!" Kaoru replied, taking the opportunity for an excuse to talk to his new friend.<p>"Didn't get a chance to thank you for helping me out with getting this place," Ukyo commented, handing kaoru dustcloth, "Didn't think I'd be able to get it so soon."<p>Kaoru scratched the back of his head, sheepishly, "Well, Mr. Kagura's a regular patient of my Dad's. He was more than happy to hear you out as a favor to me."<p>"Well, thanks all the same, hon." Ukyo replied, before returning to revarnishing the floor, "What brings you by?"<p>"Well," Kaoru began, quickly gaining nervousness in his voice, "I noticed that you were in town again to work on your restaurant again, so I thought I could come by and... get some... get a girl's advice on something."<p>Ukyo paused, and gave Kaoru a sideways glance, "I'm probably not the best person to ask about this, sugar."<p>Kaoru continued to wipe the table down furiously, "Well, you're still better than members of my family. You see, it's... well.. about this girl..."<p>Ukyo raised her head in understanding, as a sly smile appeared across her face, "Ah, I see what it is. What ya want to know?"<p>"Well, there's this incredible redhead staying with my aunt, and... well, I sort of have a hard time, you know, approaching her?"<p>Ukyo blinked, "A redhead? Dyed?"<p>"If it is, I didn't see any roots." the young Ono replied.<p>"Impressive!" Ukyo nodded, "And you want my opinion on how to talk to her?"<p>"I was hoping you may have some ideas. I talked to my Dad, since he had... similar problems when he first was asking out my mother, but I don't think he could really give me any help on this. In fact, I'm afraid he may end up messing things up."<p>"Why's that? And I think that table's done already."<p>"Ah..." Kaoru moved to another table, "Well, he's probably going to try to set me up on a date with her with Aunt Nabiki. I don't want my Dad meddling in things, even if he means well."<p>Ukyo turned away, "I can understand that." She had turned away so that Kaoru couldn't see her glower. She definitely knew the repercussions of a father trying to do what's best for his child.<p>Returning to her cheerful expression, Ukyo turned back around, "I'll tell you what, hon, you need advice, I'll give you the best I can, but don't expect any miracles!"<p>"Thanks Ukyo! I can see you're going to be a great friend," the young Ono commented appreciatively, "So, first problem, how can I talk to her without becoming a babbling wreck?"<p>Ukyo's lips twitched, "It's that bad?"<p>"I'm probably understating it," Kaoru replied in a serious tone.<p>Ukyo gave a slight smile, and shook her head slowly.<p>_<p>Ranma returned hom, grumbling as she wiped the water from her face, "Jerks and their sprinklers. They could move them closer into their lawns!"<p>With a sigh, the pigtailed girl opened the door, and stepped inside, "Nabiki' I'm ho-ACK!"<p>Nodoka blinked curiously at the redhead, "Dear, people are jumpy."<p>Shampoo slowly walked out to the front hall with a tired, exasperated expression, just as Nabiki dashed in with wide eyes.<p>"IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!" Ranma shouted, waving her hands in front of her face, "PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME KILL ME!"<p>Nodoka tilted her head, "It looks like a young girl who enjoys giving the neighborhood boys a cheap thrill by wearing wet silk shirts with no bra. Who might you be?"<p>Quickly, before Ranma could incriminate herself, Nabiki interjected, "Rachael... Rachael Mc...CLAREN!"<p>"Rachi-ell Mi-Kraren?" Nodoka repeated, surprised at the name.<p>With a neverous smile, Nabiki stepped behind 'Racheal', and put both her hands on the redhead's shoulders, "Yes, you see, she's Irish..."<p>"Hmm," Nodoka mused, "That name sounds like it would be Scottish, actually."<p>Nabiki's nervous smile got wider, "Ah, of course! Of course it is! But she's Irish! She's here on a foreign exchange program, like Shampoo here!"<p>"Interesting, Shampoo had just told me that she was here on a training mission or sorts," Nodoka answered with a confused expression.<p>"Shampoo student in Japan. Is same as training, yes?" Shampoo interjected, unsure of what was going on, but decided to play along.<p>"I suppose," Nodoka consented, and turned to Rachael, "For a foreigner, you speak Japanese well."<p>"Ah..." Racheal began, before turning to Nabiki for help.<p>"Her... mother... insisted that she follow the family traditions," Nabiki carefully explained, ensuring that everyone in the room would know the story.<p>"But you said she was Irish with a Scottish name!" Nodoka began to frown, finding something suspicious about the whole thing.<p>"Mother Japanese, yes? Father Scottish?" Shampoo helpfully explained.<p>"Irish," Nabiki corrected.<p>"I'm going to die," Racheal groaned, "Ow!"<p>"Ah, let's go to the living room, and I'll bring the tea right out," Nabiki quickly supplied, after kicking Racheal in the back of her ankle.<p>_<p>"So you're housing two foreign exchange students?" Nodoka questioned, before sipping her tea.<p>Nabiki nodded, now a bit more comfortable with the lie, "Well, I always enjoyed community work and stuff like this, and my house is more than big enough."<p>"I see," Nodoka set tea down, and offered Nabiki a sly smile, "But aren't you afraid of being offered competition for my son?"<p>Racheal and Shampoo looked at one another, as Nabiki groaned, "Nodoka, really, I'm not going to marry your son."<p>"Oh?" Nodoka was suddenly clutching a long, silk wrapped bundle, causing the other three to blink as to where it came from, "Is there something wrong with my son?"<p>"Oh, no, no!" Nabiki quickly supplied, "But really, he's just way too young for me!"<p>"HEY!" Racheal interjected in an indignant tone.<p>"Shampoo no see problem," Shampoo added, suddenly recieving Nabiki and Racheal's glares."<p>"See, someone agrees with me!" Nodoka stated.<p>"What Shampoo say?" the Amazon enquired, blinking at the heated looks she was recieving.<p>"It's not your fault, dear, I assure you," Nodoka consoled.<p>"ANYWAYS," Nabiki moved to change topics, "may I enquire the reason for your... pleasant... and unexpected visit... yet again?"<p>Nodoka looked away, "Couldn't I just come to see my daughter-in-law and my son? Do I need to have a reason?"<p>Nabiki was about to speak against the 'daughter-in-law' comment, before she stopped, and realized something about Nodoka. "No... no, I don't suppose you need one. Though I wish you would at least call, first."<p>Racheal didn't miss the sudden change in Nabiki's demeanor, and looked curiously up to the woman. Nodoka smiled, and nodded. "By the way, where is Ranma?"<p>_<p>Nabiki, Racheal, and Shampoo waved goodbye, as Nodoka left to catch the bus. Once the Saotome Matriarch disappeared from sight, Nabiki dropped her expression to a sad frown which didn't go unmissed by either Shampoo of Ranma.<p>"What wrong?"<p>Nabiki sighed, "She's lonely."<p>Ranma frowned, "Yeah, isn't she?"<p>"You noticed, too?" Nabiki commented, somewhat surprised by Ranma's observation.<p>The pigtailed girl shrugged, "How could you not miss it?"<p>"Is too, too sad," Shampoo supplied, shaking her head.<p>"Ranma, we can't keep on lieing to her like this," Nabiki stated, turning to the pigtailed girl.<p>"You're gonna let me go find a cure for my curse?" Ranma asked, hopefully.<p>Much to her dismay, Nabiki shook her head, "I'm not going to let you go running off to the deities only know where for some cure that may not even exist. We're going to have to make her understand things, and get her to accept it without becoming too irrational."<p>"This still sucks," Ranma grumbled, but shrugged. Suddenly, she turned a wryly curious look to Nabiki, "McClaren?"<p>The older woman shrugged herself, and turned to walk back into the house, "Almost bought one, nice cars. Now come back inside so we're not overrunning the air conditioning."<p>_<p>It had been almost a week since Nabiki put in the request for Shampoo's visa at the same school Ranma was going to, and wasn't too sure when she would hear back from them about their petition to the goverment on wether they would be granted permission to accept a foreign student or not. Even once that was done, there were still several steps in order to complete the process which could take possibly months, that was assuming the school was granted with its permission.<p>Nabiki leaned back on the newly repaired couch, considering how exellent a job Ranma and Shampoo did on fixing something that had been halved. If anything, those two could go into furniture repair. Unfortunately, the house repairs Nabiki insisted the two do for their little tryst through the house not too long ago only kept Shampoo occupied for a short while. It was beginning to concern the middle aged woman, as she could see Shampoo becoming stir-crazy from being couped up.<p>There wasn't much of a choice, Shampoo was an illegal alien, and if she were sent home, she would have been deemed a failure by her village, and punished accordingly. No, Nabiki wouldn't let that happen. She would find a way of allowing Shampoo to stay if one avenue failed, but she couldn't let the girl out too much. If she were found out, all hell would break loose for both her and Nabiki for housing her.<p>Ranma seemed to spend a great deal of time away from the house, leaving Nabiki unsure about how she felt with that. She had a suspicion the pigtailed boy was a bit concerned about being around what he had told Nabiki, outside of Shampoo's immidiate presense, the 'violent maniac'. Nabiki had to chuckle at the recollection, as it brought up older memories of her teenage years, being the description used quite often to identify her younger sister by a of their peers, but didn't really excuse Ranma for making the obnoxious comment. Nonetheless, the girl had introduced herself to Nabiki by making attempts on Ranma's life, so she could understand his wariness of her.<p>Shampoo decided that Ranma was too irritating to make any effort of reconsoliation with, aside from the fact, Nabiki also suspected, that she thought that she would have to kill Ranma if her Japanese hostess failed. So, Shampoo decided that it would probably be best if she crossed paths with the boy as little as possible.<p>Occasionally, Ranma would spar with Shampoo, making the excuse that he needed to keep his skills up, and Shampoo complied for the same reasons. Out of the sessions, Nabiki could tell they at least developed a begrudging respect for one another, but weren't quite ready to trust one another.<p>"I guess if it holds the peace around here, I won't complain too much," Nabiki stated out loud.<p>"If what hold peace?"<p>"Good workout, Shampoo?" Nabiki asked without looking back to the girl who just entered the house, and changing the subject.<p>Shampoo shrugged, even if Nabiki didn't see her, "Is okay, I no have all proper equipment for real training."<p>"Mmm, I guess I could probably get away with sneaking you to a local gym or something, if you like," Nabiki replied, bringing her arms onto the back of the couch. "Want to watch a movie, or something after you bathe?"<p>"Sound good. Shampoo-"<p>Nabiki turned to Shampoo with a raised eyebrow, causing the girl to smile in chagrin.<p>"I..." Shampoo started again, "I no... do not watch many movies. Friend in village get movies when she go on trade trip to east, but Sham-I no have time. Great Grandmother always training me."<p>Nabiki nodded, before getting up, and heading to her DVD stand"What do you want to watch? I have a few martial arts movies. I'm not really big on romance, so-"<p>"Disney movie is good."<p>"Ow!" Nabiki cried out, as she bumped her head against the top of the case while trying to rise back to standing. Covering her pained forehead, she turned to Shampoo with a blank, surprised look.<p>Shampoo took a step back at the expression, "What?"<p>The doorbell rang, sparing Shampoo Nabiki's incredulousness. The older woman groaned, deciding she was due for another visit from Nodoka, since she hadn't visited since... the previous day, and took her time getting to the door. Shampoo held back, not wanting to spend too much time with who she also thought it was, but knew she couldn't leave since the woman would eventually ask about her.<p>"Hold on, I'll be there in a second!" Nabiki called out, just as the doorbell rang a second time. With a sigh to steel herself, Nabiki opened the door, finding no one there. Nabiki blinked a couple of times, wondering what sort of game Nodoka was playing on her, probably something to prove the percieved 'age difference' betwixt them, and looked out around the sides of the door.<p>"Down here, dearie."<p>Nabiki jolted at the voice from below her, and looked down to find an old woman with long white hair, wearing a green Chinese robe and supporting herself with a knarled staff almost twice her height, "Um, h-hello?"<p>Before the woman answered, she looked around Nabiki's legs, before calling out in Mandarin, "Shampoo, attempting to escape through the patio in the back yard would be futile. Please save an old woman the effort of having to further hunt you down, and stay put."<p>The patio door, nor Shampoo could be seen from the doorway, yet Nabiki heard Shampoo's whimper, and the glass sliding door of the backyard close. "Mrs. Tendou," Nabiki looked down, having her attention redirected to the old woman, "How do you do? I am Khon Lon, Xian Pu's Great-Grandmother."<p>_<p>Nabiki looked over to see Shampoo physically sweating from where she was sitting on her knees on the floor, as she and Cologne found comfort on the couch. Taking a gulp to help quell her unease, Nabiki spoke, "So, what brings you here? I mean, I was under the impression that Xian Pu was on a... self training mission."<p>"My Great-Grandaughter you can call Shampoo if you wish, as it's easier for your tongue. As for why I'm here..." The old woman pulled out a folder, and handed it to Nabiki, "I decided it would be best to deliver a copy of these records in person. I know how troublesome our mailservice can be sometimes, or how the goverment in Beijing can oft times drag their feet with such important issues. After all, my heir's education is a paramount one."<p>"I see," Nabiki replied, knowing there was more to the story than being told. The slight frown on Shampoo's face only confirmed it.<p>"And you would be correct in assuming I also had great interest in seeing how my Great-Granddaughter was fairing. It has been awhile, and you can forgive an old woman for her concerns." Cologne turned to Shampoo with a slight glare, before speaking in Mandarin, "Well? Had you managed to kill the redheaded girl?"<p>Shampoo's nervous smile grew wider, as she ran her fingers through the hair on the back of her neck, "Well, honorable and esteemed, merciful Elder, great and loving Grandmother, it's like this..."<p>"If you're referring to Ranma," Nabiki interjected, "There's been a little complication on that."<p>Cologne turned to Nabiki in surprise, inwardly cursing herself for her carelessness, "Oh, I presume that my Great-Granddaughter had informed you of her situation?"<p>Nabiki gave a chagrinned smirk, "Well..."<p>"I'm home," a young, feminine voice called out, causing both Nabiki and Shampoo to groan.<p>"...you can say that," Nabiki finished, in a tired voice, before turning to reply to the girl who had just entered, "Welcome back, Ranma."<p>"Man, I swear that those jerks must aim for me when they're washing their cars," Ranma groused, before stopping, and seeing their visitor, "Who's the old ghoul?"<p>Shampoo went pale, as Nabiki covered her face in embarrassment, "Ranma, haven't I told you to keep your mouth shut if you have to make comments like that? And MUST you drip all over the carpet?"<p>"Well, excuse me! It's not like I had a chance to dry myself somwhere," Ranma retorted.<p>"Hello, Ranma," Cologne greeted with a cheery smile, "I see you survived your trip from China intact."<p>"Huh?" Ranma replied, wondering how the old woman knew her.<p>"Forget it, just go upstairs and change clothes, and hurry up back down here. It looks like we're going to have quite a bit to discuss."<p>Ranma shrugged, and quickly made her way upstairs. As she did so, the Amazon Matriarch turned a serious glare towards her heir, "Shampoo, you will have a great deal of explaining to do."<p>"Yes, Great-Grandmother," Shampoo replied in a quiet voice, as she lept her eyes down to the carpet.<p>Ranma returned shortly, wearing a black shirt and pants that seemed to fit his female form better, more to not let on suspicion about her curse than anything, if the old woman was from China, "So, sup?"<p>"Ranma, I would like you to meet Shampoo's Great-Grandmother, Cologne." Nabiki introduced, hoping Ranma would realize on his own the gravity of the situation.<p>Obviously, she did not, "Yo." Ranma gave a curt, but courteous bow to the old woman.<p>"And how do you do, young man?" Cologne greeted back bowing from where she sat.<p>For several moments, Ranma, Nabiki, and Shampoo were silent. Eventually, Nabiki broke it, "How...?"<p>"The way he refers to himself in masculine and his obviously male gait were the most revealing factors," Cologne answered, before barking a sharp laugh, "I'm not unfamiliar with Jusenkyo, you know? And it's not all that inoften that some poor fool drops by our village hoping for a cure, after getting themselve cursed. Really, you would have think some of these idiots would heed the sign warnings or the guides."<p>"I'm right here, you know?" Ranma replied with a half-lidded stare, "And it wasn't exactly my idea to train there."<p>Cologne, Nabiki, and Shampoo largely ignored the complaint, "Perhaps we could discuss matters over some tea? This old woman's feeling a bit dry, you know?"<p>"Not a word, Ranma," Nabiki stated, causing Ranma's mouth to shut just as it opened to comment, "I think we could use some tea to steady ourselves."<p>_<p>As Nabiki left to start the kettle, Cologne began conversation with Ranma, as if she hadn't decreed that her Great-Granddaughter end her life at all, "So, young man, how is it you came into Ms. Tendou's aquaintance?"<p>Ranma felt slightly unnerved by her cavalier attitude, warily replied, "Um, I guess I'm kinda a friend of the family's."<p>"He's Nabiki's betrothed," Shampoo clarified, gaining a raised eyebrow from her elder. Cologne didn't have at all a problem with it, as their own tribe had ways of ensuring a fruitful marraige from such age differinciated couples, but as far as she knew, it was still an extremely unorthodox practice in most cultures, particularly Japanese.<p>"What she say?" Ranma enquired nervously. From Nabiki's heavy sigh that could be heard from the kitchen, it didn't hold promise.<p>"Really, now?" Cologne replied, instead of answering Ranma's question at first, "I do believe this has an intriguing story behind it. Perhaps you would like to tell us how you became engaged to such a woman many years your senior? To break the ice, as it were."<p>Ranma baulked, "Ah, umma... wellthatis..."<p>"Our fathers moronic idea, nothing more, end of story." Nabiki stated from the kitchen, loud enough so everyone could hear it,<p>"Then I'm to presume you two oppose the idea?" Cologne probed further.<p>"Shut up, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed girl glared towards the kitchen, before pulling her eyelid down in Nabiki's general direction.<p>"It's not something that is all that accepted here in our country, you would say," Nabiki answered, as she walked in with a tray of cookies and cups. "The kettle should be ready in a minute or so."<p>"Good," the old woman replied, "I suppose there is a great deal of cultural differenc that I am still unaccustomed to. Forgive my prying."<p>Nabiki sat next to the pouting redhead, and laid a hand on her shoulder. Ranma blinked, and turned to look at Nabiki, who nodded, and gave a reassuring smile. Ranma relaxed, not quite feeling as irritated as she was before.<p>"I understand you wish to enroll Shampoo in one of the local schools here for her stay?" Cologne restarted the conversation, and changed the subject.<p>Nabiki nodded, "I thought it would be the best way to allow her to stay in the country- Ranma-hon, can you get the kettle for me- legally."<p>"Sure," Ranma complied with Nabiki's wish, and got up to remove the heated and whistling kettle from the stove.<p>"Well, I have to say that was some rather sharp thinking, young lady," Cologne congradulated, "And I approve of the idea of Shampoo attending school abroad. It's rare we can encourage our village's youth to venture out into the world and learn more about it. They always produce such splendid results when they do. Why, one of our current and best healers earned her doctorate in medicine in South Korea!"<p>"I could see where the influx of new knowledge would benefit your village," Nabiki replied, as scooted over to allow Ranma her seat. The pigtailed girl laid the kettle on the tray, before sitting down.<p>"But, on the part of Shampoo being an illegal alien, you can rest." Cologne produced a passport, and tossed it at her Great-Granddaughter, "You seemed to have forgotten this before you left."<p>Shampoo blinked, and then flipped through the pages of the small book, "Shampoo no have passport..."<p>"You do now," Cologne replied in a dry tone, "It's also already been stamped for your arrival, and your air ticket stub's encased within."<p>Shampoo shrugged, and put the passport down her cleavage, "Shampoo no think Ranma make it out of China alive. How know need passport?"<p>Nabiki considered correcting Shampoo's improper Japanese, but decided to let it slide for the time being. "And how, prey tell, is this all legal?" the middle aged woman enquired with a wry, amused tone.<p>"Well, it's not *perfectly* legal, per say," Cologne replied, chuckling, "Getting the necessary paperwork for our visit to Japan was a matter of having the proper connections. The passport was a simple slight of hand, the official was rather confused when he thought he had already stamped my passport. As for the ticket stub, well, few would ask as to why an old fossil like me-"<p>"Quiet, Ranma."<p>"What? I wasn't going to say anything!" the redhead defended.<p>"As I was saying, they wouldn't ask too many questions to an obviously senile old lady, who insisted that they collect the ticket for her dear old, and apparently imaginary, Great Grandchild." The Amazon matriarch gave a beeming smile that made even Nabiki shudder slightly. Future note, invest in more facial creame later on in life.<p>"Well, then that's taken care of. But we still have to await news if the school I intended to enroll Shampoo in was accepted to host for a student Visa." Nabiki stated, as she prepared tea for everyone, "But at least she won't have to remain couped up in this house for most of the day."<p>"Quite so," Cologne agreed. She took the offered cup, inhaling the pleasant aroma, before taking a sip. After a contentful sigh, the matriarch turned a stern look to her heir, "Though, Shampoo, I warn you to be on your best behavior. We are now guests in this country, and representatives of our own people. It would behoove us to act as so."<p>"Okay, Great-Grandmother," Shampoo replied, although a bit puzzled. Things like that wouldn't usually concern the Elder, as she tended to want to finish business as soon as possible, and leave the outsiders to their own devices.<p>"If there's one request that I could make of you, Ms. Tendou, I would be greatly indebted to you, even moreso than I am now."<p>"Which is?" Nabiki enquired, as she leaned forward. Ranma jerked, as she suddenly found Nabiki pressed a bit tighter against her. The pigtailed girl smiled nervously, as she shifted slightly in order to gain some leeway between them.<p>"If you could continue housing Shampoo for another few days? I'm currently in the midst of rennovating a local restaurant for my stay. You see, I'm staying on a work visa, I'll be residing in Japan as a restauranteur."<p>"Not a bad idea, actually," Nabiki mused, as she leaned forward, causing Ranma to become even more uncomfortable, reached for her tea, and then leaned back. Ranma visibly relaxed when none of Nabiki's endowments were pressing into her shoulderblade. "And I'd be glad to house Shampoo for a while longer.<p>"That's good to hear," Cologne replied in a relieved voice, "Since that has been resolved, I must be going, although I would like to have a word with my Great-Granddaughter in private to ensure her behavior isn't, if you should say, proper?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, "Sure, though I haven't had much problem with her before."<p>"Then I shall speak with you later, Ms. Tendou. Walk me to the door, Shampoo." Cologne's heir respectfully complied, as she followed her Great-Grandmother out of the house. Cologne motioned her to close the door, before speaking to her great-grandchild, "Shampoo, you understand what you must do, I presume?"<p>"What do you mean, Great-Grandmother?"<p>"If you're reluctant to kill the boy, that leaves only one other option. Do you understand what I am implying?"<p>Shampoo blinked, and blinked again, before bringing her hand to her mouth, "Aiyaaa..."<p>_<p>Nabiki stared dispassionately down at her desk as she stood over it. She had sensed something wasn't quite settling about the old woman, but...<p>Her reverie was interrupted, as her head snapped up at Ranma's call. "Yo, Nabiki, I'm outta towels in here."<p>Nabiki hadn't considered that she would probably need to allocate more towels into the main bathing room, since there were two people who would be using it. Removing her finger from the 'on' button of the comm. unit on her desk, she walked into her bathroom to retrieve more towels.<p>_<p>Shampoo stood over the pigtailed boy, as he fidgeted in his fitful sleep. She was at a loss of what to do, as things became complicated too quickly with the arrival of her Great-Grandmother. She wasn't sure how much longer she could stall the situation, and she could safely bet that Cologne would be keeping an eye on things.<p>Looking down at Ranma, Shampoo realized that it wouldn't be too hard at that moment. He wouldn't wake up, and before Nabiki discovered anything in the morning, she would be long gone.<p>"N-no, getaway!"<p>The young Amazon jolted at Ranma's outburst, and idly wondered what he was dreaming about. She knelt next to him, careful not to disturb him as he flopped away from her. The thoughts of completing her mission were waysided as Nabiki came to mind. As much as her honor demanded resolution to her own plight, she couldn't do that to the woman who openly trusted her, even when she was headhunting for her pigtailed nemesis, took her in when she had nowhere to stay, and even willingly offered to assist Shampoo without asking anything in return. Well, sparing Ranma's life was part of the bargain, but Shampoo was sure Nabiki had her welfare in consideration as well.<p>"Ahem, as liberal as I may be compared to other guardians, I'm afraid that this little midnight rendevous won't be allowed to occur."<p>"Aiyaa," Shampoo jolted at the sound of Nabiki's voice, and found the woman standing in the doorway with her arms folded.<p>"And exactly why are you in here?" Nabiki enquired in a tone that hid her current attitude.<p>Shampoo answered honestly, "Ranma make noise, Shampoo... I come and check him. Is okay?"<p>Nabiki saw Ranma unrestful sleep, obviously disturbed by dreams, and relented, "I suppose, but next time, just come and get me, alright? That way none of these misunderstandings will have to take place in the future."<p>"I understand." Shampoo stood up from next to Ranma, and turned to leave the room. She cast one final glance to the pigtailed boy, before walking by Nabiki.<p>"Good night," the older woman greeted to Shampoo, before turning back to Ranma. From what she could see, it seemed as if he were trying to defend himself from something, lots of things, in fact.<p>Allowing the concern to be expressed across her face, she took Shampoo's place next to Ranma, and carefully rested her hand on his shoulder. He jerked away from her touch, but she wouldn't be deterred.<p>"Ranma, it's me, I'm here," Nabiki whispered in the most calming tone she could muster. She put her hand on Ranma's shoulder again, and was prepared for him to pull away again. He stiffened, but Nabiki verbally announced her presence once more.<p>Instead of jolting away, Ranma rolled into Nabiki's knees, resting his arm on her lap. Once he was close enough, she draped one arm onto his back, while using her other hand to direct Ranma's head onto her lap. "It's okay, Ranma, someone's here for you."<p>From the doorway, Shampoo watched the scene for a few more moments. No, she couldn't do that to Nabiki. As much as she had against Ranma, it was fairly obvious that Nabiki was rather attached to him. With a soundless sigh, Shampoo left for the other guestroom downstairs, deciding that she couldn't take Ranma from Nabiki, one way or the other.<p>_<p>Ranma awoke, still feeling the energy sapping haze that accompanied the first experiences of the upcoming day. Despite the lethergy of rising for the morning, the pigtailed boy felt slightly more refreshed than he usually did. As much as a morning person as he was (forced to be so from his constant early-morning sneak attacks by his father), he would often have to force himself to rise.<p>At the moment, though, he didn't even feel the obligation to fully awake, instead partaking in the urge to remain comfortably in his bedding. He couldn't explain it with his muddled state of mind, maybe it was the comfortable temperature, or the soft, pliable mass pressed against him. Possibly it may have been the lack of any bright light, since the window outside revealed it to be a cloudy morning, or it possibly may have been the delicious scent of Nabiki's hair right under his nos-<p>Ranma's eyes snapped wide open, as he slowly shifted his gaze down. The sight he was met with brought a panic that the pigtailed boy barely managed to restrain for fear of waking her up. Nabiki, asleep with his arms around her, under the covers with him. The more he realized the situation, the faster his cool began to fade. "Ah... Na-N-Naaaa, Na-n-n-n-"<p>At the slight jostling and Ranma's studdering, Nabiki was coaxed to waking. Taking a deep breath before focusing, she blinked, and realized she wasn't in her room, on her much more comfortable bed. Of course, the firm body she was snuggled against more than made up for it. "Uh, wonder when I fell asleep..."<p>"Wh-WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?" Ranma finally managed to screech out, almost jerking out of his bed and away from the woman, before realizing that he could feel his bare legs against hers. "Eep!"<p>"I fell asleep here, what does it look like?" Nabiki replied in a sardonic tone.<p>"I mean WHY are you in my bed, half-naked?" Ranma clarified, beginning to sweat.<p>Nabiki gave the pigtailed boy a droll look, "I'm wearing my pajamas right... uh...?" Nabiki blinked, realizing she wasn't feeling satin against her legs. A mild feeling of panic began to grow, as she slowly began to lift the covers to see where her pajama bottoms went.<p>She didn't get a good view, as Ranma quickly slammed his hand on the covers, keeping them pinned around the two, "DON'T LOOK DOWN THERE!"<p>Nabiki chuckled nervously, as she scratched the back of her head, "Ah... heh. I have a tendicy to kick my pants off when I get too hot in bed..."<p>"DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT!" Ranma shouted almost hysterically, as he attempted to wrap his blanket around himself.<p>Nabiki quickly caught it before it was removed from her body, and kept it tight around herself, "Hey! I need this!"<p>"I need it more than you!"<p>"WHAT ARE *YOU* BEING BASHFUL FOR?" Nabiki shouted back, her calm now completely shattered.<p>"I AIN'T GONNA LET YOU SEE ME LIKE THIS!"<p>"IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE!" Nabiki bellowed back, tugging at the cover.<p>"AND I'VE ALREADY SEEN... what do you mean 'haven't seen before'?"<p>Nabiki blinkced a couple of times, before her expression grew slightly angry, "You're not asking me about my past sex life, are you?"<p>"NO! I WASN'T ASKING ABOUT THAT! I THOUGHT YOU PEEPED ON ME OR-"<p>"Nihao!" Shampoo chirped, as she suddenly jumped into the room, interrupting Ranma.<p>"AAAH!" Both occupants of Ranma's bed screamed at the sudden appearance, pulling the cover halfway over their faces.<p>"SHAMPOO, IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!" Nabiki wildly pleaded, wanting to wave her hands in in emphesis, but realizing that she might lose the flimsy protection of the blanket.<p>"SHE CREPT INTO BED WITH ME WITHOUT ME KNOWING!" Ranma accused, pointing at Nabiki with his free hand.<p>"I DID NOT!" Nabiki defended herself, before realizing something, "Well... sort of..."<p>Shampoo didn't even seem to take notice of their denials, "I make too, too delicious breakfast for two lovebirds! Is good for getting energy back up after long night of too, too much loud noise!" Shampoo bowed, and bounced out of the room, and down the stairs out of their earshot before she broke down in laughter. Their expressions were just too, too priceless.<p>Both Nabiki and Ranma sunk deeper under the cover, before turning to look at each other with concern.<p>"Um..." Ranma began, clearing his throat, "We didn't actually... you know... do anything, did we?"<p>Nabiki's expression turned into a flat stare, "You know? Most guys would be bragging about a half-naked women in bed with them..."<p>_<p>Nabiki sat at the dining room table with her hands folded under her chin. Ranma had left for his first day back in school, While Shampoo cleaned up from breakfast. "Shampoo, nothing happened last night, and I think you know it."<p>Shampoo didn't turn around from the sink, as she simply shrugged, "Is no business of mine. Shampoo only hope Nabiki happy with airen."<p>Instead of going for the bait, Nabiki decided to tackle a different subject. "How do you feel about Ranma?"<p>At the question, the young girl paused. She remained quiet for several moments, before continuing, "He annoying male, but Shampoo guess he is nice sometimes."<p>"I'm pretty sure a cute young girl like you would make him pretty happy."<p>Shampoo still didn't turn around at her hostess's probing, "In village, is honor for young mans to be favored by seasoned warrior."<p>"That's not how things are here in Japan," Nabiki commented, as she sat up, "Listen, Ranma isn't a bad catch at all. Sure he's got a few rough edges, but he's enough to keep a girl happy. He's also a hotshot martial artist, I would think that would appeal to you, especially if it gets you out of having to try to kill him."<p>"Already tell Nabiki, Shampoo defeat by girl-type Ranma in villiage, not mans."<p>"I think that that may not be as much a problem as you're letting on," Nabiki replied sternly. After she spoke, she didn't miss the way Shampoo went rigid.<p>The lavender haired girl quickly tried to regain control of her shock. Nabiki hadn't heard her and her Great-Grandmother, had she? No, it wasn't possible, her elder would have easily sensed Nabiki's presense if she attempted to eaze-drop.<p>"Is still too, too big problem." Shampoo stated, firmly. She finally turned around to face Nabiki, before continuing. "Shampoo... I no understand why you pretend no like Ranma. Is good for you, yes?"<p>"No, Shampoo, he isn't good for me," Nabiki retorted. She took a deep breath to calm herself down, "Look, even if I wanted it, me or Ranma, it wouldn't work out in the end. I admit that I do care for him, but it's not in that way."<p>Nabiki stood up, and walk to stand before Shampoo. She placed a hand on the girl's shoulder, and continued, "If you at least tried to give him a chance, it would help clear up all of our problems. All I'm asking is for you to get to know him, he might surprise you."<p>Shampoo stared at Nabiki, frowning, "Shampoo want to explore large village. No have to be cooped up in Nabiki home no longer. Is okay?"<p>Realizing Shampoo was evading the situation, Nabiki sighed, and relented, "Sure, just mind your Great-Grandmother's wishes, and don't do anything foolish, alright?"<p>Shampoo nodded, before quickly taking off. With an aggrivated groan, Nabiki went back to the dining room table to retrieve her empty coffee cup, and refilled it with what was left from the morning's pot. She braved the bitter taste of the stronger leftover coffee, as she considered what to do next.<p>"Really, Shampoo, why are you avoiding it so much?" she said outloud to herself. A slight sensation of irony settled in her, as she asked the rhetorical question.<p>Her reverie was broken by the ringing of the phone. Setting down her coffee, she walked to her home office, and answered it there, "Hello? Tofu, good morning... redhead staying here?" Nabiki's eyes roamed the room nervously, "Well... it's a bit difficult to explain... talk to me about her, when? S-sure, I guess, but it would probably be easier to explain things with her around. You're buying?"<p>Nabiki's expression became a smirk that could be heard over the phone, "You know a girl like me never turns down a free meal. Maybe, but there's always something satisfying about spending other people's money. Heh, I promise not to break you... this time, but it must be pretty important if you're offering, so it *is* going to cost you."<p>With a chuckle shared on the other end, as they both felt the slight nostalgia from Nabiki's comment, she began to wrap up the call, "I'll see you then, bye."<p>After she hung up the phone, the middle-aged woman's curiosity peaked, "I wonder how he found out about Ranma's girl form?" Shrugging off the inquiry, she decided to go out back and work out the morning kinks, before showering and having to meet up with her ex-brother in law.
