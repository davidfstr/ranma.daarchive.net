</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki had seen both Ranma and Shampoo to school that morning, but didn't quite feel obliged to return to work that day. She wasn't scheduled to return just yet, anyhow, but with the lack of anything important to do, she had considered it out of prudence.<p>Instead, she was sitting at her dining table, enjoying a late morning coffee of a stock she rarely indulged in. Her nose hung over the mug, indulging in the rich, robust scent that adittadly was her most favorite part of a good brew. She should go out and do some light grocery shopping, but she decided to wait until Ranma returned, since he was the one doing the majority of the cooking. His input on what they needed would be rather valuable.<p>It wasn't like waiting for Ranma to come back to her was an unberable anticipation. She was hardly some lovesick twenty-year old anxious to see the 'center' of her life put back in its place. Nabiki was patient, and quite frankly wasn't about to let her world revolve around the pigtailed martial artist, just share it with him. Share with him her home, share her time, share with him her experiences, share her feelings, herself...<p>Once again, she proved herself far from inexperienced, when a languish smile appeared across her face, instead of any sort of blush. She had more than a couple of lonely years to make up for. Even if she wasn't the typical Japanese woman, she was not the sort to simply indulge in promiscuousness to simply sate hormones. It probably would have cut down on how much she had spent in wine, chocolate, and for that very brief, regrettable period, cigerettes (to which, she still hadn't quite forgiven Kasumi for the suggestion), but she felt still a need to hold herself to higher standards than what even her unmarried peers tended to. But now, there was Ranma, and...<p>Nabiki took another sip of her now tolerably temporate coffee, curbing delicious thoughts for another time. With a sigh, she considered something else. Nabiki prided herself, that even if she was a bit indulgent financially, she was a big girl, and capable realizing when she had things she should own up to. Like a couple of apologies.<p>Even if they didn't need to have their noses so deep in her and Ranma's business, Nabiki had to think Nodoka and Jesse had their hearts in the right place. She, on the inside, couldn't exactly say she and Ranma made the perfect couple, and she would still hesitate to say anything of the sort, while the two women and Shampoo worked almost zealously to get Nabiki to accept feelings she either didn't know she had, or possibly were not even in place yet. That was beside the point, the simple fact was Nabiki had said and done some things in order to push them off the course of their goal. Once again, even if it was not any of their direct concern, Nabiki may not have needed to go as far as she did.<p>Even if the coffee was still comfortably warm, it couldn't recover her mood. She really did owe them an apology. With that in mind, Nabiki knew that Jesse would be most likely busy at work, and wondered what Nodoka was doing this day...<p>_<p>Nodoka hummed to herself, as she walked through the low gates surrounding her home. Life had become routine for her, once again, as there was nothing else it could be. She continued to work the job she had taken a while back to simply maintain day to day expenses, while the savings she had earned through Nabiki's company and their investments kept her from having to worry about living check to check. She tended to her home in preparation for her husband's return, and she kept a somewhat busy social life.<p>As much as she refused to let on, Nodoka's social life was far from what she wanted. True, she had friends still, but even the few that were her peers, she was forced to keep a formal face before them. No jests or such that would come with being close friends, just simple and polite discussing of events from political to local.<p>She tried not to think too much about it, for the last attempt she made at a close friend failed dismally. And while she could admit to an interest with Nabiki's American associate, seeing as how they shared a singular goal, Ms. Jesse Summers had been unavailable since Nodoka had last spoke to Nabiki. Nodoka chose what she thought was her son's happiness over her want for a close friend, though later on, she came to realize that those choices were still of her own desires.<p>Nabiki stated adimantly she wasn't interested in a relationship with a sixteen year old boy. While on the surface, Nodoka couldn't blame her, as her own upbringing as a proper Japanese woman would have her understand the problems that would arise socially. Nabiki's job depended a great deal on her public face, so in that aspect, it would harm her greatly.<p>No, what Nodoka saw was the true issue, was that Nabiki was denying it on a personal level. It was as if she were fighting her own feelings on the matter, denying even what Nodoka could see was endearment to her son. For a woman that was ages beyond Nodoka in her modernistic attitude and confidence, she was simply afraid of admitting interest in a young man.<p>Regardless of any gentle coaxing on her behalf, along with that of the dear young Chinese girl and Jesse's assistance, Nabiki wouldn't budge. Worse yet, Nabiki suddenly demanded that Nodoka take her son back immidiately.<p>Nodoka was reminded of the old saying, 'you could smell the fear'. Something scared Nabiki fiercely, and Nodoka didn't have to be a witness to the event to confirm that something far too close to comfort happened between her and Ranma. Sadly, things escalated from there to the point ultimatums were made. In a way, Nodoka's gambit paid off, since she was rather positive that her son was still with Nabiki at her home, but she was now estranged from both him and Nabiki.<p>That was the past, and the past could not be undone. Nodoka began her humming once more, as she fiddled for her keys. The bags of groceries were a bit difficult to juggle while searching her purse, and moved to set one of them down.<p>"Let me take that for you."<p>"AH!" Nodoka didn't even notice someone come up behind her, as she launched her second bag into the air in shock. Immidiately turning around, she saw the last person she expected to see any time soon.<p>Nabiki put her martial arts skills to good use, quickly setting down the bag she had retrieved from the other woman, and quickly moving to catch the groceries before they hit the ground. The last item, quail eggs, she caught, and place gently at the top.<p>Ms. Tendou didn't take any pride in her act, as she was busy trying not to appear too self-concious. The last time she spoke to the woman glaring at her, it wasn't on the best of terms.<p>After several moments of silence, Nodoka acknowledged Nabiki's presence, "Ms. Tendou."<p>At the highly formal tone, Nabiki gulped, but kept her face firm, "Nodo... Ms. Saotome..." Several more moments, neither spoke; Nodoka scrutenizing the other woman as if trying to determine her intentions, while Nabiki stood nervously and accepted her examination. Finally, before the tension overcame her, Nabiki spoke again, "If it wouldn't be a problem..." Nabiki took a deep breath, "perhaps we could go inside and talk?"<p>Slowly, almost imperceptably, Nodoka nodded.<p>_<p>Nodoka didn't even bother with tea, which Nabiki already suspected ment that the other woman wasn't expecting her to stay long. Nodoka sat across the table from Nabiki, maintaining a formal position. Nabiki herself sat lotus position, doing her best to look the other woman in the eyes. It was a given that Nodoka was still rather mad about what happend over three weeks ago.<p>Nabiki dropped her eyes to the table, "I'm sorry."<p>Nodoka's hard expression changed to a dumbfounded shock, "Excuse me?"<p>"I had no right to say the things I did, even if I was... 'under duress'."<p>Nodoka reinstated her previous expression, "And between you and my son?"<p>The truth broke pride like the most brittle of blades, "I... I would like him to remain a part of my life... as he's willing."<p>Nodoka allowed the hint of a smile to cross her face, "Excuse me, while I go prepare us tea. If you'll forgive me for being such an impolite hostess." Nodoka stood up, and bowed to Nabiki, before heading to the kitchen. It was still a great surprise that Nabiki was willing to make the first move, even if Nodoka's own pride and determination at seeing things through would not.<p>Nodoka silently praised Nabiki for it, and admired her all the more because of it. Nodoka had things to apologise for, herself, and fretted that she would never truly get the chance to do so. Maybe, the two of them together will build a bridge between them that would have a stronger support than upon the back of her son. The past could not be undone, but it could be rectified.<p>_<p>Ranma leapt from the neighboring house's roof, landing neatly before the front door of Nabiki's home. He had once again forgone taking the buses back from school, if only because he could return that much faster, and see Nabiki that much earlier. Unfortunately, he had forgotten that she didn't often get back before he did from work, which left him with a sensation of disappointment when he didn't see her car out in the driveway.<p>With a resignated sigh, he turned off the house alarm, and unlocked the door. Morosely, he trudged in, removed his shoes, and turned to close the door. His expression picked up a bit, as he considered would be good for dinner. He would have to check to see what they needed first, before he headed down to the closest market and-<p>"YAAAAAHHHHHH!"<p>Both Nabiki and Nodoka stood before Ranma, grinning shamelessly. "Welcome home, son," Nodoka greeted, keeping a warm, motherly smile that was masking her mirth.<p>Nabiki's humored smirk had to be hidden behind her hand, while her shaking shoulders proved testemont to her enjoyment of Ranma's reaction, "You're right, Nodoka, it is fun."<p>"Y-y-y-..." Ranma studdered, pointing at the two women he swore weren't there a second ago. Words failing to fall that route, Ranma turned, and pointed outside, "But your car..."<p>"I parked it in the garage," Nabiki stated, easily, finally managing to calm herself down.<p>Ranma blinked at that, "You have a garage?"<p>"You're about as astute as your father is," Nodoka drolled humorously.<p>"I mean... I know she has one, but why, well, she never used it." Ranma attempted to explain. He knew about it, but it just occured to him that it was usable.<p>"The door opener was jammed, and I'm usually just too lazy to lift it manually," Nabiki commented, shrugging. Finally, she allowed the happiness of seeing Ranma again grace her face in the form of a gentle smile.<p>She strode up to Ranma in as calmly as possible while trying to close the distance quickly. Ranma was somewhat startled when she brought herself within his personal space, brought her hands to the back of his shoulders under his arms, and pulled his torso to her so she could reach his face for a kiss. Reacting, Ranma wrapped his arms around her waist to both steady himself and embrace her, before hesitatingly returning the kiss. He felt the woman he loved smile through it, as her lips stretched pleasantly against his. Even if Nabiki favored such sweet, light kisses, Ranma found them just as fulfilling as the deep, involved ones they've traded to his count, three times now. Neither of them came often enough, in his humble opinion.<p>Nabiki broke off, and almost chuckled at Ranma's goofy, dazed expression. The pigtailed martial artist snapped to it, once Nabiki began to step away from him. He turned a sideways glance towards his mother, eyeing her approving nod. He was pretty positive that Nabiki was doing it to show off in front of his mom, but he wasn't going to complain.<p>"Uh..." Ranma began, at a loss of how to follow that greeting up, "...well... how was work?"<p>Nabiki didn't refrain her laughter, as she ruffled Ranma's hair, and kissed him on the cheek. "I didn't go in today. Had some errands to run. Still have to go do some grocery shopping, though." Nabiki tilted her head, "So you might want to make out a list if there's something we need."<p>"Uh, sure," Ranma replied, "But you could still have easily did it without waiting for me." Truth be told, Ranma was slightly disappointed with not being able to stay home with Nabiki, but pushed that particular emotion out of the way as inconsequential.<p>"Well, you are cooking tonight, right Ranma-hon?" Nabiki enquired with an arched and hopeful tone. Ranma perked up at the idea that Nabiki may be looking forward to his cooking, and was about to comment before the door opened behind him.<p>"Oh, Hey Shampoo," Nabiki greeted, "How was your first day at... school?" Shampoo looked up at Nabiki, finally allowing the middle aged woman to see her expression. Nabiki had a sinking feeling that the resignation in it had anything to do with classes.<p>"Hello, Nabiki, my classes were educational," Shampoo stated in a somewhat lifeless tone, before turning to Ranma, grabbing him gently by the face, and treating him to a firm kiss. "Hello, beloved."<p>Nodoka was absolutely beaming, "Oh my! So you've decided to take dear Shampoo on as a mistress?" Nodoka turned to voice her approval to Nabiki, and caught the other woman with an expression far from amused. Turning to look at Ranma, and seeing his extremely shocked expression, tinged with a little outrage, the Saotome matriarch frowned, and quickly drew a more accurate presumption of the situation.<p>"Excuse me," the Amazon quickly mumbled, before heading quickly to her room.<p>After her departure, Ranma managed to get his voice back, "Now... waitasec... I had nothing to do with that, alright!"<p>Nabiki wasn't listening, as her expression grew possibly more angry than either Ranma or Nodoka had seen it. Before the pigtailed boy could further his defense, Nabiki shoved him aside with enough force to even stagger him, quickly donned her shoes, swore, walked back to the livingroom with her shoes on to retrieve her keys from the end table, and left through the front door, slamming it on her departure.<p>"So..." Nodoka managed to start, almost a full minute after Nabiki left, "Did you have anything in mind for tonights meal?"<p>Ranma himself wasn't listening, as his face almost contorting to a full snarl, "SHAMPOO, GET THE HELL DOWN HERE, NOW!"<p>Instead of waiting for her to come down, Ranma immidiately went up to confront the girl, followed closely by his concerned mother.<p>_<p>"COLOGNE!" Nabiki strode into the Cat Cafe, unconcerned by the startled patrons that were currently occupying it for the late afternoon rush. She approached the open window where the meals would be set out to be taken to the customers, barely tolerant of having to wait for the old woman to put in her appearance.<p>much to her ire, she would have to wait for a while yet. "Welcome, Ms. Tendou. Please forgive my neglect to greet you, as I am to be the only one facilitating things in my Grandmother's absense."<p>Nabiki's anger didn't completely abate, "So, where is she? Cologne?"<p>"To my knowledge, I am unaware," Ku Shui replied, adjusting his glasses as he gave Nabiki an apologetic look.<p>Nabiki nodded, curtly, "Well, I came by to let her know that she should be preparing a room here for her heir, because my home's become a bit crowded with her presence."<p>The Chinese chef's eyebrows climbed to the top of his forehead, "I see, something of great grievence came between you? I choose not to change your mind, but I would request an explanation, if you please. My daughter's actions reflect heavily upon me as her father, and would not wish her to practice any misconduct."<p>Nabiki felt that she would be more than happy to let Shampoo's father know of his daughter's actions. Besides which, he just may well not condone what's going on, and possibly assist in hindering Cologne and her plans. "It's only fair," Nabiki replied, out loud.<p>"I thank you for your patience, and request a small favor as I prepare some tea for us." The Chinese man set a tray of food before Nabiki, "If you please, this belongs to the trio in the far left."<p>"Fine, but I'm not interested in staying long," Nabiki quipped, as she took the tray, balanced it easily on the palm and fingertips of her right hand, and carried the order to it's intended destination. "So, whom ordered what?"<p>"Um, pork and mushroom ramen in ginger sauce for me. I think he ordered the garlic fried chicken with sesame sauce." one of the young men at the table replied.<p>"Right," Nabiki set the orders out, suspecting the last one was for the guy not spoken for. "Enjoy, alright? Food's pretty good here I can say from experience."<p>Nabiki turned off, finding Ku Shui sitting at one of the empty tables near the kitchen entrance with a kettle and two cups. Understanding he was ready to meet with her, Nabiki strode over, sashaying slightly to maneuver around a couple of tables.<p>"She a new waitress?" One of the young men at the table enquired, before digging into his ramen.<p>"Dunno, she looks a bit too old to be a waitress here, maybe she's the cook's girlfriend?"<p>Lucky guy, she's pretty hot for an old chick," the third one commented, still staring after Nabiki.<p>"Dude, she's old enough to be your mother!"<p>"Well, mommy can punish me for naughty thoughts, rwaor!"<p>Nabiki fought the urge to pick up something and throw it in their general direction, the least they could do was try to keep their comments out of her hearing range. Instead, Nabiki put on a fake smile, and sat down across from Ku Shui, "I hope I' not distracting you from your duties."<p>"I have a few moments of respite I can take and indulge in. My concern is upon you. Just what had my daughter done?"<p>Before Nabiki spoke, she thought for a second, before sighing, and gathering herself, "Well, it's not so much what she's done, but what she's being made to do by your Grandmother."<p>The Chinese chef sighed, as if he wasn't surprised, "Ah, my dear daughter does take complete obedience to my grandmother. Forgive me of her trespasses."<p>"I don't see it as your fault, don't worry," Nabiki replied, drinking some of the tea, "but I'm afraid I can't have her living with me anymore, if it will make matters that much more complicated."<p>"I understand, and I apologise for any inconvenience. I shall prepare for my daughters return, if that is your request."<p>Nabiki finally smiled, first time since she had seen Ranma return home that day, "It's good to see someone in your family's sensible."<p>Mr. Zian smiled softly, and nodded, "Yes, it had been advised by my late wife that one of us must maintain a level head, and she did not want the obligation."<p>Nabiki chuckled, her humor a bit higher than before, "Well, I'm sorry to take time off your duties, and bring you news like this, but you can understand my urgency."<p>"Oh, you've done more than practice graciousness by allowing my daughter to stay with you. It is distressing that she and my Grandmother would take advantage of your hospitality as such."<p>"It's not often that you come across a guy like you, you know that?" Nabiki enquired, starting to get up from the table.<p>"Perhaps it is my Neichiizu upbringing," Ku Shui supplied.<p>"Whatever it is, keep it, it suit you," Nabiki replied in a light flirt, "I better get going. Ranma and Nodoka's probably wondering how they're going to help me hide the body by now."<p>The Chinese middle aged man chuckled, "Then it is best you depart before their imaginations consume them. As it is, feel free to keep this humble man company whenever you feel the want."<p>Nabiki smiled, "I'll keep that in mind, until next time."<p>Ku Shui nodded with his ever present subtle smile, "Until next time, then."<p>_<p>Nabiki arrived back home, maybe in a better mood, but still not all forgiving. The middle aged woman wasted no time as she entered, "Shampoo!"<p>"We're all in here." Nabiki tilted her head at the sound of Nodoka's voice calling from the kitchen, and followed it to find the other woman sitting patiently at the table, along with Ranma and Shampoo.<p>Nabiki motioned her head towards the stairs, "Go get your stuff, I'm taking you back to your restaurant."<p>Both Ranma and Nodoka looked at the Amazon, suprising Nabiki with their almost pitying expressions. Shampoo spoke up, "Nabiki, you must listen carefully."<p>"Sorry, but my patience has come to an end," Nabiki stated, almost emotionally, "I'm afraid that it's time for you to leave."<p>"If you would just listen to the poor girl..."<p>"No, Nodoka. the 'poor girl' has become a conflict of interests. I'm sorry, Shampoo."<p>"Nabiki, just-"<p>"I don't want to hear it, Ranma," Nabiki was starting to find her anger again, wondering why they were even taking Shampoo's side on this. She expected Ranma to be possibly even angrier than herself.<p>"Nabiki, please..."<p>"Quite stalling, Shampoo," Nabiki commanded, as her face deepened it's frown.<p>"{Will you just listen to me for a moment!}" Shampoo demanded, becoming infuriated by Nabiki's stubbornnes.<p>"Nabiki, that ain't fair," Ranma interjected, barely holding back his own irritation at being cut off.<p>Nabiki dropped all prenotions of restraint, "'Fair', Ranma? Fair that someone I TRUSTED... no, TWO people I trusted, just stab me in the back? Would it be FAIR that I simply ignore the fact that she MEANT to kiss you?" Nabiki was nearly growling, because if she didn't remain angry, she would be in tears, "This isn't an act anymore, Ranma! Cologne wasn't around to witness this little show, she's trying to convince herself to go through with this!"<p>"That is not true, Nabiki," Shampoo stated in a quiet voice.<p>"DON'T EVEN..." Nabiki managed to calm herself just a bit, "Don't even think I'll just let you take Ranma from me! I'll be DAMNED if I let this happen a second time! Now GET OUT, and take the damn bus back!"<p>Everyone in the room winced at Nabiki's resolute proclimation, and the slight trickle that was beginning from the corners of her eyes. "I am sorry," Shampoo swore in a quiet, but determined voice, "But I have much to explain."<p>"You don't have to explain anything to me," Nabiki's voice was just as quiet, exept instead of resolve, it was tempered with hurt and betrayal.<p>Shampoo came to stand right before Nabiki, not backing down, "{I will be heard, because there's much more to this than you realize.}"<p>"{I don't ca-}MPH?"<p>"Oh... dear," Nodoka murmered to herself, as Ranma stared as if he were struck dumb. Nabiki's own eyes were as wide as saucers, but just barely managed to pull her face away just as she started to feel Shampoo's tongue against her lips.<p>"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?" Nabiki shouted, now backed against the wall.<p>"There," Shampoo replied in a haughty tone, "Now Nabiki is even with Ranma." Nabiki sputtered, trying to get her own composure back, as<p>Nodoka calmly retrieved a hankerchief from her person, and used it to wipe the slight trickle of blood beginning to stream from Ranma's nose. "I suppose Ranma and I shall leave you two to talk, then," she stated, as she lead her son to the bathroom.<p>"{Shall we sit down?"}" Shampoo enquired, while pointing to the table.<p>Nabiki wiped her mouth, gently enough not to smear her own lipstick, "If you think that little stunt did anything for you-"<p>"{Please, at least let me explain myself,}" Shampoo pleaded in a desperate tone.<p>Nabiki nodded slightly, barely even noticably, before moving to the table, "Talk, but don't expect me to change my mind on anything."<p>Shampoo sat down next to Nabiki, causing the older woman to shift her chair away slightly. With a sigh, the young Amazon began to explain herself, "Great-Grandmother, she tell me that she no longer will tolerate my... my... {insencerity}. She demand that I now pursue Ranma, or else..."<p>"This isn't helping your case any..."<p>"She say," Shampoo started again, "that if I do not show result, she will... intervine... is the right word?"<p>"Your Great Grandmother has always been involved with this," Nabiki countered, far from swayed any.<p>"She has done nothing, but if she do intervine, it all taken out of my hands." Shampoo looked down at the table, "{Nabiki, I promise you, I would never dream of taking Ranma from you. Since I had met you, and understood your relation with him, I had thought of nothing else but seeing the two of you admit your desires for one another. At then, it was no more than wanting to see a part of my beliefs from my people proven in the outside world. But now I know more than that, I know the two of you belong together, as much as the two aspects of yin and yang do. Male and female, cocky and reserved, impulsive and relaxed...}" Shampoo smirked slightly, "{Young and old. Ranma doesn't belong in my fate, at least no more than a friend. He belongs with you.}"<p>"{Then why did you kiss him?}" Nabiki challenged in Shampoo's own language, "{if you don't honestly care for Ranma, then why even put up that little song and dance when your Elder wasn't even around?}"<p>"{Because I don't know if she is around or not!}" Shampoo shot back, "{I doubt even father knows where she is half the time. She promised that she would be keeping an eye on me, and I don't have the skill to be aware of her presence when she doesn't want me to be.}"<p>"{Then why are you saying all this now?}"<p>"{I want you to understand that I do not mean any ill towards you. Even if she overhears me this very moment, it is not as important as clarifying things with you now.}"<p>Shampoo turned away, looking back at the kitchen area, "{I should have considered your reactions first, but I had thought you would give me a chance to explain when I thought it a good time to do so. I'm sorry if I hurt you, but... but I'm not sure what I can do, now.}"<p>The middle aged woman groaned, covering her forehead, "It wasn't necessary, you know? Kissing me. You could have just waited until I managed to cool down enough to listen."<p>Shampoo pouted, "You did not enjoy it?" At the glare Nabiki gave her, Shampoo giggled, causing Nabiki herself to lighten up a bit, before joining in.<p>"Let's just say that I may be more liberal on my views than most in this country, but some things I'm not at all interested in."<p>"Oh?" Shampoo replied, arching an eyebrow. She didn't mind kissing a certain redhead, the Amazon recalled.<p>"I'll warn you now, Shampoo," Nabiki began in a serious tone, "I-"<p>Shampoo brought a hand up to forestall any further, "I understand. I value you trust and friendship. If I am forced to finally choose, I only hope Great Grandmother is understanding."<p>"You are going to have to choose at sometime," Nabiki stated, "You plan on simply forestalling things indefinitely?"<p>"I... think of something, hopefully. Just need much time." Shampoo stood up, and bowed to her host, "Thank you for listening, and I again apologise for breaking your trust." After Nabiki nodded in acceptance of the apology, Shampoo beamed a smile, and began to walk out the kitchen, before stopping at the threshold. Shampoo turned, with a slightly destressed and upset expression, "Was I really bad?"<p>Nabiki gave the girl a lopsided smirk, "I've had worse, I'd give it a six." Shampoo snorted, and headed for the stairs. Ranma entered the kitchen, soon after, finding Nabiki preparing a pot of coffee.<p>"Hey, isn't it a little late for that?" the pigtailed boy enquired, only used to seeing Nabiki drink the beverage in the mornings.<p>"Caffine will help steady my nerves," Nabiki replied casually, staring at the slow drip of the brown liquid into the pot.<p>"You usually drink wine or something for that," Ranma commented.<p>"Not in the mood for any alcohol. Where's your mother?"<p>"Well, she decided it may be best to head on back home for the time being. She hopes everything is okay, though." Ranma stated, going to the fridge to find something to drink for himself. "So you and Shampoo are square?"<p>"For the time being," Nabiki responded, "You seemed to take it all pretty well. If I didn't know better, I would swear you enjoyed her kissing you..."<p>"Heck no!" Ranma quickly proclaimed, "I mean, it caught me by surprise, just as much as you!"<p>Nabiki turned to Ranma with a playful grin, "Hmm? And I bet you enjoyed that little show between me and her?"<p>"Uh... n-no..." Ranma's blush spoke of his sincerity in his reply, "I mean... would you want to see me kissing Ryoga or something?"<p>"Ranma-hon, I would PAY to see that," Nabiki said with a hearty grin that unnerved Ranma.<p>The pigtailed boy baulked, "I mean as a guy!"<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow, "I presumed as much."<p>Ranma's former blush was replaced with a pale complextion, beforehis face became red from irritation, as he realized Nabiki was teasing him, "That's not funny!" Nabiki only chuckled, as she went to get a mug for the brewing coffee.<p>_<p>Ku Shui tilted his head, as he felt the first rays of the morning sun grace his skin. It would be a fine day, he thought, as he continued preparations to open the restaurant. His work was as therapeutic as the most soothing of songs, and the most gentle of breezes. He was rather happy when his Grandmother had requested his help with her business endeavor in the land of the Rising Sun, it would give him a chance to test his skills in a more casual climate, with people who wouldn't heavily critisize his dishes. Granted, he did quest for heavy scruteny, but there was much to say for simply having someone greatly enjoy your creations, rather than pick at its pros and cons.<p>It still puzzled him, of course, as to why he had been called. He knew his Grandmother well, and that she would have been more than fine making meals for customers. He had also given a great deal of teaching to his own daughter, and though she wasn't the most lavish or creative cook, she was at least compotent enough to exel above other Chinese restaurants which made their meals much like a factory makes products; lacking the attention and care that a culinary artist strives for. There was an alterior motive, he was sure, but he lacked any of the sufficient clues to properly identify them.<p>He suspected it had something to do with Shampoo and her supposed betrothed, the young man Ranma that he admitted to taking a liking to. He wasn't sure of their status, but he didn't think that Ranma had any interests towards his daughter, at least romanticwise. Shampoo herself never made mention of him in any such manner, so he doubted that there was any sort of relationship there other than associative.<p>Unfortunately, Cologne persisted that Ranma was Shampoo's betrothed through Amazon Law, and even though he believed in the laws of his people, his beliefs only went to a certain extent. That was one of the primary reasons he had traveled so much in the first place, for fear that he may end up having to speak against something that conflicted with his own notions. As it was, if Shampoo didn't care for Ranma in such a way, he would not condone the marraige. Once again, it was unfortunate that it was not his place to decide such matters. Even if it wasn't, he was adimant that it was not his Grandmother's, either.<p>It upset him that he hadn't much seen his daughter exept for sporatic visits, but he understood that they both remained busy, and it made their schedules difficult to match. He would like to talk to his daughter to a greater extent about her stay in Japan, how she was getting along with the beautiful woman that hosted her, and the young man that was also Nabiki Tendou's guest. Alas, each visit she made tended to be for Cologne, even if Shampoo made it a point to say hello to her dear father. Once again, he was suspect that Cologne was attempting to limit his time with Shampoo, but decided that even if she was devious, she wouldn't be so malicious as that. Cologne may have been Shampoo's guardian in the village, particularly since he still traveled, but Cologne understood that Ku Shui was still her father, and Shampoo's only living biological parent.<p>Ku Shui was saddened to hear about the conflict between Nabiki and Shampoo, they had seemed to get along well together. Shampoo's father found that of interest about the middle aged woman, that she could be so friendly with anyone with sincerity in her kindness. As was his experience, much of Japan practiced a friendly demeanor, but much out of formalness than any endearment. Nabiki gave a casual friendship that was comfortable to be involved in; truly she was a woman that could provide great caring.<p>As upsetting as it was to hear about their falling out, Ku Shui couldn't refrain from feeling a little joy at the news. His daughter would be staying at the restuarant along with him, so he wouldn't have lack of her company any longer. He presumed that Nabiki would be bringing Shampoo back last night, but that had not been the case. Nonetheless, he remained eager at her arrival.<p>The sound of a staff's point striking wooden stairs stirred him from his reverie, "{Grandmother, good morning.}"<p>Cologne entered the stockroom, favoring her Grandson with a smile, "{Good morning. I am glad I had requested for your servitude. An old woman can now comfortably sleep in without worries of her establishment.}"<p>Ku Shui smiled, before hefting a crate of noodles to carry back to the kitchen, "{Grandmother, we are both aware that you are not lacking in vitality. Your age only applies to your gained wisdom, not your physicality.}"<p>"{Your flattery is why you remain one of my favored of our family,}" Cologne chuckled, as she followed her son, "{Regardless of or differences of opinion.}"<p>"{I thought it was because I was the only one willing to disagree with you. As you had so kindly stated, 'it's nice to have at least one male in our family that didn't devolve his spine'.}"<p>"{I said such a thing? My manners!}"<p>Ku Shui let out a robust laugh, "{Your apologies are not necessary, Grandmother. That is one subject we both agree upon.}" The middle aged man set the crate down next to the range stove for easy access to the contents of it when needed. "{Also, I have some news to discuss with you, if you will pardon my tardiness for this information. I would have told you sooner, but I had only seen you now since I had been told what I have to relay.}"<p>"{Oh?}"<p>Ku Shui turned to face Cologne, clasping his hands behind his back, "{It appears that Ms. Tendou is unable to continue to accomidate Shampoo. I suspect sometime within the day that my daughter will be coming to stay with us.}"<p>As he suspected, the cheer on Cologne's expression departed abruptly, "{Is that so?}"<p>"{I am unsure as to what brought this change about, but she had been rather adimant about it.}"<p>"{Hmm,}" Cologne mused aloud, "{Perhaps I should discuss this with her. Perhaps convince her that whatever may have caused her misjudgement may not warrent such a strong response?}"<p>"{It is your choice to try,}" Ku Shui stated, not willing to debate on it. Any further reply from Cologne was stalled, by the ringing of the phone. It was far too early for any orders, so either could only guess as to what it was about. "The Cat Cafe... Oh, Ms. Tendou, it is lovely that I can hear your voice this early morning, for it brightens it further. My Grandmother had commented towards that also, but I am sincere.}"<p>Ku Shui blinked, before the slightest hint of a frown colored his face, "I see. Yes, I am gladdened you and my daughter are able to reconcile. If you will, it would make me happy if you and my daughter were to perhaps visit for a meal? To celebrate disputes settled, and please bring Ranma along, I would like to enquire on his presence, as well. Then perhaps tomorrow night? I am happy to hear your acceptance. I understand, and a pleasant day for you, as well."<p>"{So, Shampoo and Nabiki have come to terms with their differences?}" Cologne enquired, not sure what to make of that. If Nabiki was no longer upset with Shampoo, that most likely meant her heir baulked in her actions.<p>Ku Shui sighed, and hung up the phone, "{It appears so. I had dearly wished to see my daughter on a more constant basis, but I am denied such.}"<p>"{It isn't as if she is far off. Besides which, if I overheard correctly, they will be by tommorrow evening?}" Cologne gave her Grandson a sly smile. "{Although, my old ears seemed to find that you were more interested in Ms. Tendou's presence?}"<p>"{She is a remarkable woman, and I find her pleasant company,}" Ku Shui replied, almost cryptically.<p>"{That she is,}" Cologne turned to leave the kitchen, "{That she is, Grandson.}"<p>_<p>Nabiki bit her lip, before giving a bow to the gateguard, who had just gotten off the phone, "[Thank you for your time and patience with me. It was of some urgency that I had requested to speak with Ms. Summers.]"<p>The current soldier on watch duty for the New Sanno Hotel shrugged apologetically, "[Sorry I couldn't give ya any better news, but you can check back whenever.]"<p>"[I shall do that then. Once again my thanks.]"<p>The guard turned to a car that approached the gate, saluted to the passengers inside after noting the decal on the top of the windshield, and reached into the control booth to raise the bar and allow them entry. After completing the task, he replied to Nabiki, "[Sure, anytime sweetie!]"<p>Nabiki's eyes flickered back to the guard, before she decided to disregard his overly friendly comment. Americans were like that, as they tended to even use endearing nominations on relative strangers. Even if she wasn't too impartial to it, it still tended to catch her off-guard.<p>As she walked down the street, she allowed the formalness to drop from her, and replaced it with disappointment. Her best friend left for the states on leave, and they couldn't give her the length of her departure. From the sounds of it, it was an indefinite leave.<p>She was sure it had to do with the circumstance of which both her and Jesse had last departed on. Nabiki couldn't even say for sure if what had gone on between them was repairable or not. Nabiki had said some things that were way out of line, even if Jesse herself hadn't gone off the deep end.<p>Nabiki knew the woman's Achille's Heel even before that 'spontanious' epithany. Jesse didn't simply 'get scheduled' to work all the time, she volinteered. And she was so familiar with Nabiki mainly because Jesse was attached to her like a long-lost sister. The woman was lonely, and she hated being alone.<p>Her work was filled with customers that she would take great joy in chatting with, and her visits with Nabiki were always as eventful as she could make them. Heck, Nabiki remembered it was Jesse herself who approached her, when Nabiki gave a rather flippant comment about her English being less than stellar. Being a hobby linguist, she offered to teach Nabiki 'proper' English, though Nabiki had learned to evade Jesse's attempts at teaching her slang.<p>The woman did have more than a few marraiges and divorces. Nabiki had realized long ago it was because she wanted to spend her life with someone, and was desperate about finding that one she could love. Unfortunately, that was not the way to go about discovering a man you wanted to marry.<p>Jesse was probably adimant about Nabiki's relationship with Ranma, because Nabiki may have let on a glimmer of interest in the pigtailed boy. That was more than she had shown to any man since...<p>"Sorry, Jesse. I never realized how much it really meant to you," Nabiki commented to herself.
