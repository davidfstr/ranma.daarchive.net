</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki opened the door, and nearly slammed it, as she entered her home. The only thing that stopped it was Ranma's hand intercepting it before his face did. The pigtailed boy stepped in behind her as she was removing her shoes, and again tried to reason with her, "Come on, Nabiki, that ain't fair!"<p>Nabiki turned to glare at Ranma, as she sloppily tossed her sportscoat onto the coatrack, and made her way to her room. As she passed by the stairway, a thoroughly irritated Shampoo was making her way down the stairs, spying the older woman. At the sight of Ranma quickly trailing behind her, and Nabiki trying to ignore him, Shampoo's eyes flashed for a moment, not of anger, but of something barely unidentifiable.<p>"Nabiki and Ranma have a problem with the date?"<p>Ranma looked up, shocked and apprehensive that Shampoo knew where they had been. Nabiki could give the girl more credit, and new that she would put two and two together quite quickly. She just hoped that she didn't finger her for putting Happosai up to distract her. "Well, it *had* been going well..."<p>At the confirmation of Nabiki and Ranma having been out on a date, Shampoo's eyes flashed again to a slightly duller, weary, and hurt gloss. If Ranma didn't know better, Shampoo seemed... dissappointed.<p>Subtly, Shampoo gave a potential reason for such an emotion, "You use Pervert Demon to distract Shampoo, is it not true?"<p>Nabiki abruptly stopped near the door to her room, but didn't turn around. Ranma looked back at Nabiki, and then towards Shampoo, and then back to Nabiki, rather surprised that the woman he loved would even be accused of such a thing, by Shampoo no less. He understood that even right the forced rivalry between them, the two of them would like to remain friends; using Happosai against one another was a very quick and easy way to end a friendship, he was pretty sure.<p>"Shampoo, I-"<p>"You do not trust me," Shampoo said, almost emotionlessly, if not for the slight poison of pain in her voice; almost factually, if subtly accusingly.<p>Nabiki could only turn to look at Shampoo, who was now standing at the base of the stairs, between her and Ranma. Nabiki had nothing to say, and could only stare apologetically at the young Amazon. Shampoo sighed, deflating almost completely, "I understand, I am sorry that you cannot... trust me. Sorry your date did not go well." She turned and gave Ranma a brief look of acknowledgement, before turning back upstairs, "Good night."<p>"Shampoo," Nabiki called out, yet the girl did not stop her ascent up the stairs, yet she wouldn't actively stop Shampoo, for the older woman knew there was nothing she could say.<p>Ranma himself was torn between assisting a girl he had at least a tentative friendship with, and his girlfriend. Even if he was divided, it wasn't a difficult choice for him to make, "Nabiki, we gotta talk about this!"<p>"There's nothing to talk about, Ranma, and I don't want to go into this right now," Nabiki said, curtly, finally turning fully to address him. "Just... you better believe it when I say 'you screwed up, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed boy deflated, much like Shampoo had, "I know that... and I'm sorry, alright? I mean, I can take plenty of knocks against me, me and Pop's sparring sessions gave me a thick hide. But it was like he was, you know, backhandedly insulting you!"<p>Nabiki's expression softened, but only somewhat, "Ranma, you were reading too far into things. He had no idea about us..." Nabiki's glare returned, "Until you pulled that stunt back there."<p>Ranma's mouth twitched almost to a guilty and apologetic grin at the memory of the kiss. Nabiki apparently knew him well, as he realized he had been picking out things that weren't there. It was just that Ranma swore the guy was trying to find roundabout ways of saying Nabiki was 'old'. And while at that, ensuring Ranma knew his place as a 'child'. Of course, Nabiki's admittance of even a twinkling of attraction for the foreigner didn't help Ranma's attitude. "Come on, do you think we could just keep hiding this from everyone? People are bound to start noticing, sooner or later."<p>Nabiki shook her head, "Ranma, right now isn't the best time for me to discuss this with you. I'm angry with you..." At the way Ranma schooled his expression and tilted his head, Nabiki quickly amended her statement, "Well, not totally angry with you, but I just want to turn in for tonight, and let this blow over, okay?"<p>At Ranma's sullen nod, Nabiki walked up to him, and kissed him on the cheeck, "Anyways, Ranma, I had a great time out, and I'm sorry the night had to end the way it did." She trailed her hand along Ranma's shoulder, before turning away, and heading into her den before going to her room, "good night, Ranma."<p>Ranma nodded, understanding that they would get no further in the conversation, "yeah, night." With that, he turned to head up to his own room. Nabiki watched his tired trek up the stairs, before entering her home office.<p>_<p>Shampoo sat in her leg, back rested against a wall while her knees were pulled to her chest. She sat there, looking out the window, and wondering over the predicerment she was in. If she refused her Great Grandmother; Shampoo, Nabiki, and Ranma would all be hurt by the fallout. If she followed the course of action her tribe's laws dictated, Nabiki and Ranma would be hurt, and that would indirectly hurt her just as much as them.<p>Anyway she could see, they would all lose. With a wry grin, as she turned to look at the ceiling, Shampoo couldn't say it was all bad, falling into this situation. The whole ordeal had changed her from the admittadly naive, brash, and ambitious girl that thought nothing was beyond her grasp, to a young woman who now understood that consequences lay beyond simply herself, and the decisions she made could carry lasting impact far into future.<p>She realized now that she did not have to accept the challenge from the impudent redhead back home, and when she had lost, fairly at that, that she didn't have to allow her pride to rule her, and initiate the kiss of death. It was an old, largely overlooked law in their people nowadays, but to invoke it was to place your honor and your familie's honor in your task. The realization of these decisions would go greatly with her prospective of becoming one of the future leaders of the Amazons. She also now knew the world existed beyond their laws, and that there was much to learn from those she considered outsiders.<p>Of course, if this all hadn't happened, Shampoo would never have found two friends such as Nabiki and Ranma. Ranma was far from other males she had intereacted with. All those she was familiar with were almost obnoxiously submissive and courteous, only her own father, Ranma, and her childhood friend Mousse had shown any backbone towards women. Unfortunately, she could not relate to her father on the level of a peer, and Mousse lost all such confidence when she herself confronted him. Ranma, on the other hand, could supply both such qualities at any time. Even if he most often treated her with casual addressment, he was welcome into her life.<p>Nabiki, Shampoo had to admit to more than a little idolization. Not even a warrior, she was strong, independant, vibrant, humble, intelligent, and gracious. Shampoo was hard pressed to find all these qualities within any of the elder women in her own village, and found them to be a pleasant package within the middle-aged woman. Shampoo wished both to simply just learn from Nabiki and to have her friendship, because simply from that, Shampoo just knew she could accomplish so much more than what she could with her skewered views.<p>In time, there was more to it than simply idolization. Nabiki revealed flaws in herself that she remained blind to, but Shampoo could easily point out, the biggest one being her denial of her feelings for Ranma. Nabiki became a great deal more accessable as a person, and even if she was a full score of years her senior, in many ways Shampoo felt as close as a sister to the older woman. Perhaps it was the lack of competition she would feel from any of her sisters in the village, or maybe subtle undertone of lonliness Nabiki felt that subconciously beconed anyone to accept her presence, but it only took a scant couple of months to become this close to her.<p>With such a friendship, it seriously stung Shampoo's heart to know that because of events, the older woman had become very guarded against her. She could almost forgive having to tolerate Happosai, compared to the betrayal she felt at the lack of faith Nabiki was giving her. She couldn't completely fault Nabiki, but she still couldn't take much comfort in the realization.<p>Sighing, and deciding it was best to sleep on it, Shampoo knew things would have to be rectified soon, before they came to their own head.<p>_<p>Nabiki sat at her desk with her hands interlaced and propping up her chin. Perhaps she did overblow things, just a bit. It wasn't as if the people back at the attic restaurant were going to think too much about it, and more than likely it looked more like an impulsive stunt of some young kid than anything. Nonetheless, it still irked her that Ranma would overstep his bounds like that when provoked.<p>Nabiki sighed, accepting it as one of the traits she would have to accept from Ranma. Looking at the clock on her computer, it was almost eleven. It wasn't exhaustingly late an hour, but she was ready to turn in for the night. Just as she was getting up, she noticed a single paper in the fax machine. Curious enough to deal with one small bit of business before she hit the bed, she flipped it over, and read it.<p>With a frown, she neatly folded the paper into fours, and threw it into the waste bin. It was too late to deal with that bit of business. Besides which, she doubted Ranma really cared to know the whereabouts of their fathers at the moment.<p>_<p>Even if she was still mad at him, Nabiki had to admit Ranma had a point. pulling into the parking lot, Nabiki once again had to consider the wisdom of the visit she was about to make. As much as she had denied it, her sisters had to be told of her relationship, at least. If she was up front about it now, less likely they would have to blow up about it later from finding out about it second hand.<p>A lengthy walk later, Nabiki was pushing open the somewhat heavy doors of her family home. She wasn't quite sure if Kasumi was home, as she intended her visit to be a surprise, but it wouldn't deter her. Just as she stepped onto the porch, she heard the commotion in the back, most likely from the dojo from the sounds of the loud 'kiyah's being shouted.<p>Nabiki stepped in the threshold of the outside entrance to the training hall, finding Kaoru almost near exhaustion, as he was soaking the wooden polished floor with rivers of sweat. Even during his obvious overexertion, her nephew radiated a great deal of determination, and she had to wonder what brought his focus up.<p>After studying him for a few moments, she announced her presence, "You need to tighten your legs as well as everything else at the point of punch impact, or else you're only getting half-focus. Your grandfather would never let you hear the end of it if he had caught you instead of me."<p>Slightly startled, Kaoru jolted out of stance, standing almost attention at the presence of his aunt. Once he realized who it was, he relaxed, though had a sheepish countenance, "Hi Aunt Nabiki. I was trying to find a way of increasing my speed while attacking, so I was practicing free stance instead of rigid."<p>Nabiki nodded, since she practiced that style more than her own father's harder Okinawan rooted stance form, "You still need to retain total focus, though. A lot of experienced martial artist won't even bother to dodge or block it if it lacks power."<p>Kaoru fought down his intended grumbling, not wanting to take his irritation out on his aunt. "I guess."<p>Nabiki tilted her head to the side, curiously. From what she had seen, her nephew had definitely gained some speed since the last time she saw him, and from the amount of exertion he was showing on himself, he would be much faster when he was at peak, "Why do you need to be faster? you're already moving quickly enough to maybe give either of your Aunties a difficult time tagging you." Not much of a lie, since Nabiki would probably have to work a good deal harder on a direct assault to get a clean tag on him at his current level, while Akane would just make an impressed expression at his progress, before finishing it quickly.<p>Kaoru scowled, "I'm still not fast enough, though. Next time I meet Ranma, I want to show him what I'm really capable of."<p>Nabiki fought the urge to roll her eyes; despite the fact that it was Kasumi's son, he seemed to have inherited her youngest sister's attitude in many instances. Then again, Kasumi was pretty competitive herself, just a lot more subtle about it. "Well, I'll let him know to look out for you the next sparring session the two of you have, sound good?"<p>Kaoru blinked a couple of times, before his eyes lit up, "Actually, if you'll hold on just a few seconds, I want to give you something to deliver to him."<p>"Well, I'll probably be here a while... where's your mother?"<p>"I've been behind you for almost two minutes, Nabiki. Really for someone who even trained directly under Happosai, you can be rather oblivious to your enviorment."<p>"Actually, you've only been behind me for about fourty seconds, sis," Nabiki retorted, grinning. "I only asked out of courtesy."<p>Kasumi 'hmph'ed, before turning around, and flicking the ashes of her cigerette outside the door, "I had seen you coming up the front walkway, sorry I wasn't able to greet you at the door."<p>Nabiki turned and gave he sister a light hug, "That's okay, Sis, I expected you would be busy with something."<p>"Not to sound curt, but was there a reason for your visit? Not that I wouldn't *mind* my sister dropping by every so often, in fact, I wish she would do it more often."<p>Nabiki gave her sister a sardonic grin, one which Kasumi had already been wearing, "Well, I have been a little busy lately..."<p>"Well, I'll start us some tea, and we can talk about it." Kasumi motioned Nabiki to follow her, as she lead her to the tea room. "So, how have things been? I haven't even heard from you in weeks."<p>"They've been..." Nabiki paused, realizing that her usual non-commital reply wasn't proper this time, "...they've been... very good, Kasumi."<p>The elder sister had caught Nabiki's pause, but at the sudden somber and wistful tone, Kasumi felt her heckles raise, "How so?"<p>Nabiki sat down at the table, almost immidiately after entering the room. Kasumi didn't even go into the kitchen, instead choosing to sit down, and doggedly awaiting for her sister to clarify. Nabiki suddenly found that it would be much more difficult to discuss the subject than she had anticipated, particularly under Kasumi's piercing stare.<p>Kasumi made starting the conversation easier, as she had a faint suspicion over what was on Nabiki's mind, "Is Ranma still living with you?"<p>At the question, Nabiki suddenly felt as if she were under the spotlight, and like a teenager who was caught in a bad situation. Hesitatingly, she nodded.<p>Kasumi's expression grew a lot more neutral, though her eyes displayed what emotions were playing through her, "Why?"<p>Nabiki felt the answer flow out of her before she even knew she was going to utter it. Not meeting Kasumi's intense gaze, the middle Tendou sister answered, "Because... I love him."<p>At the solid confirmation, Kasumi closed her eyes, and rubbed her forhead in irritation, at the same time feeling the urge for a whole pack of smokes, "Good Lord, Nabiki."<p>"It's not like I just meant for this to happen," Nabiki quickly countered, immidiately put on defensive by her sister's disapproval.<p>"Nabiki, you're claiming your in love with a fifteen year old child. This is too rediculous for *anyone* to intend."<p>"He's sixt-..." Nabiki stopped her rebuke, as it wouldn't do anything to help the situation, "I'm sorry if this upsets you, but I've done a lot of soul searching on this. I won't even say I wanted this, or want things the way they are now, but I do know that nothing's going to simply change the way I feel about him."<p>"Nabiki, just think about this for a second. You're still a very attractive woman. You have an exellent job. You have no current immidiate family obligations, and I'm positive you have plenty of prospects. Why are you ignoring perfectly logical choices for a relationship for a totally unrealistic infatuation?"<p>"Because I didn't come to love those 'logical choices' you mentioned," Nabiki responded heatedly.<p>"Maybe it's because you never bothered to get to KNOW those other choices?" Kasumi rebuked, now reaching into her apron for a cigerette.<p>"You seem to think it's that easy," Nabiki challenged, already growing exasperated with her sister.<p>"Unfortunately, I know how easy it is," Kasumi stated, lighting her cigerette, "Eventually, you'll find that things aren't the way you intend for them when you let romance get to you."<p>"You're talking from experience?" Nabiki asked, subconciously knowing this was a topic she didn't want to step into.<p>Kasumi rolled her eyes, as if the answer to the inane question was obvious, "As much as I did care... still care for Tofu, it was a mistake to marry him."<p>"And you're saying my nephews were a mistake then?" Nabiki asked, harshy, as she had taken offense to the implication.<p>Kasumi's glare was twice as angry as Nabiki's, "Don't *ever* say anything like that again, Nabiki."`<p>Nabiki shirked back at the chill in her sister's voice, "I'm sorry, that was well out of line."<p>Kasumi took a drag of her cigerette, and turned to look at the TV, staring at it as if it were actually on, "So you're planning on keeping Ranma around? For what? Perhaps to raise a family with him? You really think he can handle that?"<p>"I... I had no intention of pushing him into anything he doesn't want," Nabiki replied in a level voice.<p>"But what do *you* want, sister? That's what a relationship involves, you AND him. If you are wanting a family, you are already on borrowed time as it is. Tofu told me once that it's because you keep yourself in good shape that your chances are still good. Were you planning on waiting for him to be prepared?"<p>"That's... I don't know the answer to that," Nabiki admitted, "But if he was willing to if in the near future, I can easily support the two of them."<p>"And how is he going to handle it? Teenage boys don't strike me as good housefathers," Kasumi stated dryly.<p>"He wouldn't have to stay at home. Ranma has plenty of prospects I'm willing to help him with. Even if things were a matter of time, I'm willing to make certain sacrifices for him."<p>"And he's willing to do the same?"<p>"Yes."<p>Kasumi blinked at the frank, unhesitating response, "And you know this for certain."<p>"There is no certainty with this, as you've already so wisely explained to me, older sister," Nabiki quipped, "I don't have all this planned, and he doesn't have any idea what we're in for..."<p>"And it's apparent that you don't either."<p>"You're right," Nabiki quickly returned, unphased by the interruption, "There's no guarentee on this, but as it's been said, love's a gamble."<p>Kasumi decided to try a different tactic, one that would definitely sting Nabiki, but would be for the best, "Just like with Mr. Kumidari, exept this would be even more of a risk." Just as Kasumi expected, Nabiki completely stumbled upon the mention of her once past and most serious boyfriend. With the advantage Kasumi continued, "Nabiki, I love you, understand that. Akane loves you, we *all* love you. We also know that even if you've made us proud with your recovery over that bastard, you couldn't take another blow like that."<p>Nabiki glared at Kasumi, fighting her eyes from tearing up. How DARE Kasumi compare Ranma to Saito! "It was nice to see you again, Kasumi. It might be best, given your response, that Akane doesn't find out about this," Nabiki stated formally, putting an intense will up to keep her voice from cracking. Not knowing if she could continue her struggle to maintain her composure any longer, without saying a word, Nabiki stood, and headed for the front door.<p>They were nothing alike. Ranma was far too innocent, while Saito was all charm, now that Nabiki looked back on it. But...<p>NO. There was no 'but' about it. Damn Kasumi for even considering using that against her.<p>Storming out the door, Nabiki almost missed her nephew approach her, "What?"<p>Kaoru shirked back at the hostile tone of his aunt, never remembering seeing his 'cool' aunt angry at any time. Seriously ticked, sure, but not openly furious. Nabiki noticed his response, and forced herself to calm down, "Sorry... just some things on my mind, what is it?"<p>The young man had heard part of the conversation between his mom and his aunt, and had to consider the wisdom of this. He didn't actually know the relationship between Nabiki or Ranma, but he knew Nabiki seemed to care for Ranma a great deal. "Ah... I was hoping you could give this to Ranma?"<p>Nabiki took the prooffered envelope, noticing the careful writing on it, addressing the letter to Ranma. With a curt nod, the middle aged woman put the envelope into pocket of the lavender vest she was wearing, "I'll make sure he gets it, take care." With that, she left the Tendou compound.<p>_<p>Nabiki arrived home, still fustrated. She knew what her sister was trying to do, and it was working, to an extent. It was hard not to doubt your heart, when it had failed you in the past, and Kasumi was right in the fact that this was a bigger gambit than with what she had in her past. Not so much the what she could loose emotionally, but what she could lose in status.<p>A few people already knew, thanks to what happened last night. Hopefully their knowledge would be inconsequential, but it was still unnerving. Kasumi would be watching her like a hawk now, and Deities forbid if Akane found out, though she had a pretty good feeling she would get forewarning from her brother in law. Fortunately he wore the level head in the family. Daddy, in all his endearing senility, would be jumping for joy at the knowledge. The middle Tendou daughter held the thought in wry countenance, that for once, one of her father's cracked plans actually managed to work. She fell for Ranma, hard, because she had to be stuck with him for a couple of months. Getting to know the boy definitely had an adverse affect on her, one she wasn't sure she fully agreed with, but it was there.<p>Well, the family was the least of her worries, really. The other points weighed much heavier on her mind. She supposed that she could step down from actively taking clients if her relationship became full public knowledge. Not that it would make a big deal in the great scheme of things, it wasn't as if she was harboring a minor, and it wasn't like it would be broadcast on the news or anything. But, just a few rumors (and she knew how easy those got around) could make clientelle uncomfortable.<p>Really? Why was she so worried about it? So she loved a guy twenty one years younger than her, big deal. It was her life, and she lived it alone long enough.<p>Snapping back to reality, she didn't even realize she was holding a conversation, "What was that, Ranma?"<p>"Something wrong?" the pigtailed boy enquired, wearing a downcast expression.<p>Nabiki gave her concern, "Is there something wrong with you, Ranma-hon?"<p>The pigtailed boy stung a bit, when he wanted to greet Nabiki's return with a kiss, positive she would appreciate it, and she casually returned his 'hello' with barely an acknowledgement, before lightly brushing him away before he could completely finish his greeting. "Ah, it's nutt'n. What's bother'n you? Where did you go in the first place?"<p>Nabiki sighed, and sat down on the couch, lolling her head back against the backrest, "I just went out for a drive to think about a few things, and ended up back home talking with my sister."<p>"Uh huh, so what did you two talk about?" Ranma asked, coming to sit next to Nabiki.<p>"You, and us, and how she doesn't like the idea," the middle aged woman replied, frankly, "Though I was already respecting the response, I can't say it didn't hurt to have her disapproval."<p>"I'm, um, sorry." Ranma wasn't sure what to do beyond maybe apologise. He could feel Nabiki's aggrivation radiating from her, and it was having more than a little unsettling effect on him. Carefully and hesitatingly, he put his arms around her, hoping it was the right course of action.<p>Moved out of her angry musing at the contact, and looked curiously at the arm that was awkwardly crossing over her chest, and then at Ranma. The pigtailed boy smiled nervously, before retracting his arms, "Sorry."<p>With a light chuckle, Nabiki patted Ranma on the leg, and kissed him on the cheek, "Actually, thanks, Ranma, I did need that."<p>"uh, that's cool then..." Ranma replied, scratching the back of his head, "Sorry I ain't all that good at this, it is kinda new to me."<p>"Ranma, just being there for me is the perfect start." Ranma perked up a bit, both at Nabiki's lightened mood, and her compliment, giving her a smile of gratitude.<p>Nabiki leaned against Ranma, deciding she had nothing more to say. She wouldn't tell Ranma the full truth as to what happened between her sister, she didn't want to burden him with that knowledge. Plus, she was pretty sure that the issue would blow up, and she would rather keep the past in the past. Old boyfriends didn't matter in the current, and she just had to remember Ranma's innocence to know he was definitely not... him.<p>"What's up for today?" Ranma enquired, already growing bored with simply sitting there.<p>"Cleaning," Nabiki said, simply.<p>Ranma blinked, and looked around. Nabiki was already pretty insistant about keep the place spotless, with Ranma and Shampoo doing much of the work, "Uh... clean what?"<p>"You, Ranma-hon, can start with the bathroom. Don't think I haven't noticed that urine track down the front of the toilet!"<p>Ranma's head shot back incredulously, "What?" It was then he noticed Nabiki's teasing smirk, "Ha... funny."<p>"Oh, also your little admirer wanted me to give this to you." Nabiki handed Ranma the envelope she had been keeping on her.<p>"Who...?" Ranma asked, before opening the letter. After reading it, he blinked a couple of times, and then stared at it intensely to make sure he was reading it correctly.<p>"What's it about?" Nabiki enquired, leaning around Ranma's shoulder to read.<p>"Uh, Kaoru's asking for a formal challenge." Ranma replied, simply.<p>"WHAT?" Nabiki nearly screeched, shooting to standing, "What in the world is going through his head?"<p>Ranma shrugged, and put the letter on the end table, "Beats me."<p>"You're not going to accept it, are you? You are NOT going to beat on my nephew!"<p>Ranma rolled his eyes at her command, "I gotta accept it, remember? Besides, I ain't gonna beat on him, it's just a friendly match."<p>"You're still gonna kill him, Ranma. I love the boy dearly, but he's *not* within your league." Nabiki got up, and pulled out her cellphone, "I'm calling him right now to retract this nonsense. He should know better than this!"<p>Ranma moved quickly to take the cellphone away, but Nabiki managed to jerk away before he could touch it. As it was, she didn't finish dialing the number. "Nabiki, listen to me for a sec, alright?"<p>"Unless it's to say you won't-"<p>"Nabiki, both you and I know good and well that he's not gonna just retract the challenge. My Pops would have a fit if he found out about it, and I'm pretty sure yours will too."<p>"And who's going to tell them, Ranma? Nabiki challenged, hanging up the phone until she had this settled.<p>"I am, and you can add that I wouldn't be too happy if you forced one of my students to back down from a challenge."<p>"You stay out of this, Happosai," Nabiki warned, knowing her demand carried very little weight against the master of her own martial arts school.<p>"No," Happosai replied firmly, "My school, my students. If the boy wants to test his mettle against a stronger opponent, well, then he's following the path of the martial artist. If he wants to improve, he needs to know where he stands."<p>"He can SPAR against Ranma, not go to war with him!"<p>"You're exaggurating," both Ranma and Happosai stated at the same time. After staring at each other, Happosai continued, "The challenge stays."<p>Knowing it was fully hopeless to argue with Happosai, Nabiki turned to continue reasoning with Ranma, "Ranma, be reasonable about this."<p>"You're being a bit overprotective of him, aren't ya?" Ranma enquired, "If he's a martial artist, he can take care of himself."<p>"Ranma, I swear, if you go through with this..."<p>"Best you stop with the threats right now."<p>Nabiki swerved to glare at Happosai, who stared back with an irritated expression. She then looked back at Ranma, causing the pigtailed boy to flinch at the betrayal in her eyes. They were both ganging up on her to defend her nephew's idiocy. She knew full well that Kaoru could handle himself, but that didn't mean she wanted to see any harm come to him.<p>"Fine, do whatever, then," with that, Nabiki pivoted on her foot, and stormed towards her den.<p>Knowing this was far from over, Ranma quickly somersaulted over Nabiki, forcing her to stop when he landed directly in front of her. With a glare that could melt steel, the middle aged woman spoke, "Move it, Ranma."<p>"Nabiki, listen to me, I ain't gonna harm him... at all, alright?"<p>"You can't give that guarentee, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed boy put his hands on Nabiki's shoulder, not even aware when he began massaging them, "Hey, I promise, okay? I'll be as gentle with him as possible, though you should give him a little credit."<p>Nabiki sulked, and looked at Ranma again, "Why are you so determined to do this?"<p>"Because it's a formal challenge. If there's one thing I take seriously, it's martial arts." Ranma stated in his most consoling voice, before quickly amending his statement, "Well... the one thing after you, I mean."<p>"So, I'm an after-thought?"<p>Ranma blinked at the sudden defensive from his girlfriend, "Uh, Nabiki, you *are8 okay, right?"<p>Almost irritated with the question, Nabiki shook Ranma's hands from her, and moved past him, "I'm fine, Ranma, I just have things on my mind. If you'll excuse me, I have some things I need to take care of." Ranma moved to the side, to allow Nabiki passage, watching her as she entered her office with a confused and concerned expression on his face.<p>_<p>"I'm glad you have deemed me worthy of even a slight of your time, dear." Ku Shui commented, sardonically, as he quickly washed the dishes from the last few orders he had had. There wasn't many for lunch on a Sunday, so he had taken to his other tasks with the restaurant with a leisurly pace. His grandmother had not been around, which had concerned him a bit, and her absence did provide him with a lot more work than he was intended for, but he took it all in stride.<p>Shampoo blushed at the subtle barb, "I'm sorry, father, but you do know I regret it."<p>Mr. Xian smiled in understanding, handing his daughter the bowl he just scrubbed, "I only tease you, daughter. I understand your life has been rather eventful these past few months."<p>Shampoo stared at the sink full of water and dishes, "Father, I know you do not agree with our... with the laws our elder has taught us..."<p>"They were practical at one time... I suppose," Shampoo's father replied in a wistful tone, "but now, they carry too much antiquity. Even the greatest of nations have laws that are ever changing."<p>"But the Couragious Women's tribe has been around much longer than they have," Shampoo countered, reciting a lesson taught to her by her Great Grandmother.<p>"Three thousand years, as opposed to the five thousand Rome has stood," Xian Ku Shui challenged, "Though it is no longer the superpower that governs the times, it is a nation that still stands, and possibly only for its changes."<p>"But it is a mere shadow of what glory it once was," Shampoo countered, already understanding her argument was futile.<p>"As our people used to be notorious throughout China, striking fear into many emperors lest we rise up, and challenge their power," Ku Shui replied, and then sighed, "Now, our village is humble, and we merely wish for the feigned ignorance of our current 'Emperors'. We have our history and culture, but do not mistake it for the formidability we once held."<p>Shampoo went silent, musing over her father's words. She understood both her Great Grandmother, and her own father's arguments. At some time in the past, they both came to a conclusion that it was best not to discuss this topic with one another, but that didn't stop either of them from attempting to infuse their beliefs into her. Cologne surprisingly never challenged it, in fact welcomed it, as she saw it as an opportunity for her own heir to learn to think for herself. Cologne herself was too rooted in the old ways, yet wasn't so foolish as to belief her grandson's words didn't have some merit in them. As it was, it was something that the younger generation would have to decide for themselves, as they would be the ones that continued their heritage.<p>"When I went after Ranma to make good on my pledge," Shampoo continued, somberly, "I truly was ready to finish her."<p>"Intent and task are two separate entities," Ku Shui replied, simply, as if he already knew the lengths his daughter would go.<p>Shampoo thought of all the times she had decided it wasn't 'sporting' to kill the redhead when they were making their trek through China. Shampoo always made her presence known, before fully attempting to follow through with her death promise, believing that whatever then happened to Ranma was only because of a lacking in skill, not because there was a true intent to put her down. Shampoo merely was attempting to test her mettle to the fullest, that was all.<p>"When I was chasing Ranma," Shampoo continued, "It was something of an experience to me."<p>"That is true, child, you had rarely visited outside our home territory, and even when you did it was into similar enviorment."<p>"True," Shampoo agreed, finishing drying another bowl, "I didn't expect so much of a difference between us and the outside world. I mean, I knew of their ways, and their views, at least academically, but I didn't... did not..."<p>"You didn't truly know they were a people, that they all have their own lives and worries, and reasons for doing things," Ku Shui finished for his daughter, "That is the difference between knowing them and understanding them. It is hard to realize what you possibly held in some distain, if you had not been among them."<p>"I eventually realized I didn't truly want to harm Ranma," Shampoo admitted, "as I chased her. In fact, I tracked her down more to ensure her presence... I would say she had almost become a friend to me, of sorts..."<p>"I've known of more peculiar friendships... and I believe you are friends now?"<p>Shampoo nodded, at least hesitatingly, before continuing, Father... I find myself, thinking about our laws more often, considering our ways."<p>At this, Ku Shui paused, and gave his daughter his full attention, "Oh?"<p>"They've... put me in a rather difficult position, one that I do not see any way out that would leave anyone unsatched," Shampoo admitted, looking down as if she were thinking hard on what she was saying, "The I do not wish for harm to any of us, but if I am to continue being a true Amazon..."<p>Shampoo stared at her father with almost a frightened expression that was carefully refrained, "I cannot help it, but I question them now. I know how our Elder would take this, that is why I do not wish to discuss this with her."<p>Ku Shui felt a slight pang of dissappointment over that his daughter's current confusion may be the only reason she came to see him, but a great pride overwhelmed it, due to the fact that she was openly seeking his guidance. "Blind obedience only lead you into obvious barriers, young one. Do not be disheartened by such thoughts."<p>"They're more than just 'such thoughts'" Shampoo quipped, seemingly angered by her father's trivilizing of her issue. She calmed down a bit, before continuing, "It's just that they now seem so... unfair. I realize the law always will seem so when it is working against you, but this just feels like something different."<p>Ku Shui only nodded silently, and motioned his daughter to continue. Shampoo firmly squashed down the building emotion, before continuing, "The decision I shall have to make... will hurt, no matter which choice I make. I would much like to see everyone happy, but what will that entail for my own future?"<p>Ku Shui already figured out what the conversation was about, even if his daughter was skating around the subjects, and he himself not knowing the full details, "Anyone's future is uncertain, but know that I will not allow you to be without one, regardless of what you decide."<p>Shampoo knew he would say something like that, and mean it, but there was a lot more to what she was implying. Nonetheless, she was grateful, "Thank you, father."<p>Shampoo's father nodded graciously, before deciding to change the subject, "Tell me, you have yet to mention of your host, how is Nabiki doing?"<p>Shampoo paused in drying the plate in her hand; eyeing her father suspiciously, as if wondering if he had already known who she had been previously talking about. She decided to test that notion, "Your interest in her?"<p>Ku Shui wore a subtle smile, "She reminds me a great deal of your mother. I could guess that is also why you took to her so fondly."<p>Shampoo didn't know much about her mother, being so young when she died, but chose to consider her father's observation, "She is a nice person. Even in this society, she stands out greatly." Attempting to be non-chalant, she continued, "You say she reminds you of mother?"<p>Ku Shui nodded, almost fondly, "She is a nice person, very welcoming and relaxed indeed. Such spirits are hard to come by in this day and age."<p>Shampoo wasn't sure what to make of her father's observation; wether it was wistful rememberance, or a slight infatuation.<p>_<p>Kasumi stood in the doorway, watching her son, kneeling on the dojo floor, his spirit almost completely crushed. Ranma had answered Kaoru's challenge, and if Kasumi had known anything about it before hand, she would have shipped Kaoru off somewhere until time passed.<p>It wasn't like he had been beaten to a pulp, as would have been her first and foremost concern. In fact, Ranma hadn't even laid a hand on him...<p>Kasumi took a slow drag of her cigerette, as she stood there watching her son for the eighteenth minute since Ranma and Nabiki had taken off; Nabiki dragging Ranma off rather quickly, in fact. It was probably a good thing she did, too, because Kasumi was pretty sure she didn't like Ranma much at all.<p>Kaoru didn't even want to get up from where he was, almost thinking that it was worthless to even bother anymore. He was sure he could at least make a decent showing against his pigtailed idol, he moved faster, more focused, and more determined than he had ever before. During his match with Ranma, he was at a peak of skill he had never attained before...<p>And Ranma danced around him as if there were no effort on his part.<p>No matter how much faster Kaoru had become, Ranma just seemed to decide to move that much faster, allowing the younger to wear himself out, before offering a patronizing 'good effort', and a backhanded insult.<p>With a soundless scream, Kaoru punched through the floor, leaving a fist sized hole in it, before finally getting up, and almost listlessly staggering back into the house proper.<p>Kasumi put the cigerette to her mouth, but failed to take a puff. She was absolutely sure she didn't like Ranma much... at all.
